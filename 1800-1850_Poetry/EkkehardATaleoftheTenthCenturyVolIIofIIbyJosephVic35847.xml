     <l n="1">Hadumoth .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The night , which had appeared long and dreary to those who had been entrusted with the watch on the battle-field , was passing away . The horror of Death lay over the whole valley . “ The Lord be merciful unto their souls , ” sounded the low-voiced call of the watchman . “ And deliver them from the sufferings of purgatory , Amen ! ” was the response of his companions , who were cowering round a campfire , on the border of the pine-wood . The deep black shadows of night lay over the bodies of the slain , as if the Heavens compassionately wished to hide what human hands had done there . At dawn of day , even the clouds disappeared , as if they also were driven away by the horror of the sight beneath them ; others came , and likewise fled , ever changing their shapes and forms ; losing one to assume another ,— everything is restless , except in Death , where eternal rest is found . Friend and enemy , side by side as they had fallen , still lay there ; quiet and calm .</p>
   <p>One slight figure like that of a child , the watchman saw gliding over the battle-field . It bent down ; walked on , and bent down again , and ever continued its search ; but he dared not call to it . He stood like one that is spell-bound . “ Probably it is the angel who is marking their foreheads with a letter , so that they can be recognized , when the spirit will return to their bodies , on the day of resurrection , ” thought he , remembering the words of the prophet . Silently he crossed himself , and when he looked again , the figure had vanished .</p>
   <p>The morning dawned , and there came a number of men from the arrier-ban , to relieve the monks . The Duchess had sent them ; although Simon Bardo was not quite satisfied with this arrangement . “ A victory is but half a victory , if it is not followed up , by pursuit of the enemy . We ought to go after them , until the last of them are annihilated , ” he said . But the monks insisted on their return on account of the Easter holidays , and the others said : “ Before we could catch those , on their swift horses , we should have far to go . They have come to us , and we have beaten them , and if they should come again , we have more blows in store for them ;— the work of yesterday deserves rest . ”</p>
   <p>Then it was determined upon , that the dead should be buried before the break of Easter Sunday .</p>
   <p>So the men fetched their spades and hoes , and dug two wide graves . On one side of the field there was an abandoned gravel-pit , which they widened into a spacious resting-place . This last was destined for the dead Huns . Arms and harnesses were taken off and collected ; forming a considerable heap in all . Then the corpses were thrown down ; one after the other , as they were brought . It was a mass of torn members , repulsive to the eye ; men and horses in wild confusion ; a throng , as when the rebellious host of angels fell down into hell .</p>
   <p>The pit was filled . One of the grave-diggers came and brought a solitary head with cleft forehead and fierce expression . “ Most likely that belongs also to the heathens , and may look for its trunk below , ” quoth he , throwing it down into the pit .</p>
   <p>When the whole field had been searched , without their discovering any more Hunnic bodies , they covered up the huge grave . It was a burial without solemnity ;— sundry curses , instead of blessings were called down , and ravens and other birds of prey , hoarsely screeching , fluttered about in great numbers . Those who inhabited the rocks on the Hohenkraehen , and the dark pine-wood beneath , had all come , Moengal 's hawk among them ; and they were evidently protesting by their cries , against thus losing their rightful prey . With a hollow sound the clods of earth and pebbles fell into the wide grave . Then the deacon of Singen came , with the vase of consecrated water , with which he sprinkled the mound , in order to banish the demons , and keep down the dead who rested in the stranger earth . A weatherbeaten piece of rock , which had some time since fallen down from the Hohentwiel , was finally rolled on to the Hunnic grave , and then they went away shivering , to get ready the second tomb , which was to receive their own dead . All those who had belonged to the ecclesiastical state , were to be buried in the cloister-church at Reichenau .</p>
   <p>At the same hour in which the battle had begun the day before , a solemn procession descended from the Hohentwiel . These were the men who had won the battle . They advanced in the same order as on the day before , but their gait was slow , and their standard was muffled in black crape . On the watchtower of the castle , the black flag had likewise been hoisted . The Duchess herself , rode also with the train , dressed in dark sober-coloured garments , which gave an unusually serious and severe expression to her face . The dead monks were carried on biers , to the brink of the great tomb , so that they should participate in the last homage rendered to their fellow-champions . When the last notes of the litany had died away , Abbot Wazmann approached the open grave , pronouncing the farewell greeting and offering up the thanks of the survivors to the ninety six who lay there so pale and still , side by side .</p>
   <p>“ Blessed be their memory , and may their remains rest in peace , until the day of resurrection ! May their names descend unto posterity , and may the glory of the holy champions , bring down a blessing on their children ! ” Thus he spoke in the words of the Preacher , throwing down when he had ended the first handful of earth ; the Duchess , as well as the others following his example one by one . After this , there ensued a solemn silence , as all those who had fought together on the day before , were to separate again after the funeral ; and many a hard-featured face waxed soft ; and many a kiss and hearty shake of the hand were exchanged at parting .</p>
   <p>Those of the Reichenau , were the first who set out for their monastery . The biers with the dead were carried along ; the brothers walking by their sides , bearing lighted tapers , and chanting psalms . The corpse of the old man from the Heidenhoehlen , long weary of life , they had also taken along with them . With bent-down head , the war-horse of the unknown warrior , covered with a black cloth , walked by its side . It was a gloomy and sad spectacle withal , to see the long funeral train slowly enter the pinewood , and then disappear amid the gloom .</p>
   <p>The next to take leave of the Duchess , were the remaining arrier-ban men . The gaunt Friedinger , with his arm in a sling , rode down the valley at the head of a troop . Only the Knight of Randegg , with a few select soldiers , was to be garrisoned on the Hohentwiel .</p>
   <p>With unfeigned emotion , Dame Hadwig , followed the departing ones with her eyes and then slowly rode over the battle-field . The day before she had stood on the tower , anxiously watching the turn the battle was taking .</p>
   <p>Master Spazzo , was now called upon to explain a good many things , and although he evidently did not shrink from exaggerating a little here and there , the Duchess seemed well satisfied . She did not speak to Ekkehard .</p>
   <p>When she too had returned home , the plain became silent and forsaken again , as if nothing at all had happened there . Only the trampled grass , the wet , reddish earth , and the two huge tombs , bore witness to the harvest which Death had held there , but the day before . It was not long , before the blood was dried up , and the grass had grown afresh . The mounds under which the dead rested , were covered with moss and creepers . Wind , and birds had carried seeds there ; and bushes and trees had sprung up in rich luxuriance ,— for plants thrive well , where the dead are buried . But the tale of the battle with the Huns , is still living in the memory of the present generation . The piece of rock which had been rolled upon the grave , is called the “ Heidenbock ” ( Heathenbuck ) , by the inhabitants of the Hegau , and in the night of Good-Friday , there is nobody who would like to pass the valley . In that night , earth and air belong to the dead , who are then supposed to arise from their graves . Then the small , swift-footed horses dart about again ; the dark columns of the christian champions on foot , eagerly press forward ; the armour glittering from under the decayed habits of the monks . The clatter of arms and wild war-cries , rise , louder than the tempest ; and fiercely rages the battle of the spirits in the air , when suddenly from yonder island in the lake , a knight in shining gilt armour , on a black steed comes hurrying along , and drives them all back into their cool resting-places . Vainly the Hunnic chieftain tries to resist him , angrily lifting his crooked sword ; but at that moment , the heavy battle-axe descends on his head ,— and he must go down like the rest ... and everything is silent as before ; only the young leaves of the tender birch-tree , are trembling in the wind ...</p>
   <p>Easter Sunday passed drearily and sadly . In the evening Dame Hadwig sat in the hall , with Ekkehard , Master Spazzo the chamberlain , and the Knight of Randegg . It can be easily imagined what their talk was about . The great events of the past days found an echo in all their thoughts and speeches ; like to the echo of the Lurlei-rock in the Rhine : scarcely has the first tone died away in one place , when a hollow , rolling sound , takes it up again in the next , and so it goes on , reverberating from all sides , as if it were never going to end .</p>
   <p>The Abbot of Reichenau , had sent a messenger to report that they had found the monastery but slightly damaged ; unharmed by fire . Further , that they had destroyed all traces of the Huns , by carrying the holy relics about , and by the sprinkling of consecrated water , everywhere ; and finally that the dead had been buried .</p>
   <p>“ And what became of the brother who stayed behind ? ” asked the Duchess .</p>
   <p>“ On him , the Lord our God has shown , that in His mercy He does not forget , poor , childish minds , in the midst of danger and peril . On our return , he stood on the threshold , as if nothing whatever had happened to him . ‘ Well , how didst thou like the Huns ? ’ one of us called out to him , upon which he said with his customary smile : ‘ Well then , they have pleased me very much indeed . Never have I seen such jolly fellows before ; and as for eating and drinking ,— they are wonderfully considerate ! The father cellarer has never taken the slightest notice of my being thirsty ; but they gave me wine , as much as I wanted ,— and if they dealt me sundry blows , and boxes on the ear , they made it up again with the wine ; and that is more than any of you would ever have done . Only discipline was wanting ,— and besides they have not yet learned how to behave in church ’ ... further he could say still many a thing in praise of the stranger guests , but this , Heribald added , he would only reveal under the seal of confession . ” ...</p>
   <p>Dame Hadwig was as yet not inclined for amusement . She graciously dismissed the messenger , giving him the finely wrought coat-of-mail of the slain Hunnic chieftain , in order that it might be hung up in the cloister-church , as a lasting token of the past battle . The duty of distributing the booty , was hers , according to the general desire .</p>
   <p>Master Spazzo , whose tongue had not been lazy all this time in recounting his warlike deeds ,— and the number of the Huns he had slain increased with every recital , like a falling avalanche ,— now said with emphasis : “ I have still got a war-trophy to present , which I have destined for my gracious mistress herself . ”</p>
   <p>He then went down to the under apartments , in one of which , Cappan his prisoner , lay on a bundle of straw . His wound had been dressed , and had proved not to be dangerous . “ Get up , thou son of the Devil ! ” cried Master Spazzo , adding a rude kick to this invitation . The Hun rose ; his face wearing a somewhat dubious expression , as if he did not believe that his life was to last much longer . Thus he limped through the room , leaning on a stick . “ Forwards ! ” said Master Spazzo , indicating the direction in which he was to go . So they went up stairs and entered the hall . Here an imperious , “ stop , ” from Master Spazzo , made the unfortunate wretch stand still , casting his eyes around with evident surprise .</p>
   <p>With kindly interest Dame Hadwig looked at the strange specimen of humanity before her . Praxedis also had come near , and turning to Master Spazzo said : “ One cannot say much for the beauty of your war-trophy , but it is curious enough . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The Duchess folded her hands : “ And this is the nation before whom the</l>
     <l n="2">German empire has trembled ! ” exclaimed she .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ The terror was caused by the multitude , and their always keeping together , ” said the Knight of Randegg . “ They wo n't come back again so easily , that 's sure ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Are you so very certain of this ? ” asked she pointedly .</p>
   <p>The Hun did not understand much of the conversation . His wounded foot hurt him , but he did not dare to sit down . Praxedis addressed him in Greek , but he shyly shook his head . Then she tried to get up an understanding , by dint of signs and nods ,— but this too was in vain . “ Allow me , ” said she to the Duchess , “ I still know of a way , to make him give us a sign of life , which I have heard of at Constantinople . ” Gliding out of the hall , she presently returned , carrying a cup , which she presented with mock deference to the dumb prisoner . It was a strong liquor , distilled from cherries and stone-fruit ; such as the late castle-chaplain had loved to concoct now and then . At the sight of this , the Hun 's face became radiant ; his blunt nose , sniffed up the rising aroma , and emptying the cup , which he evidently regarded as a sign of peace , he threw himself down with crossed arms before Praxedis , and kissed her shoe .</p>
   <p>She made him a sign that the homage was due to the Duchess , upon which he wanted to repeat his thanks to her ; but Dame Hadwig stepped back , and beckoned to Master Spazzo , to take his prisoner away again .</p>
   <p>“ You have queer fancies , ” said she to him , when he had returned , “ however , it was gallant of you , to think of me , even in battle . ”</p>
   <p>Meanwhile , Ekkehard had been silently sitting at the window , looking out over the country . Master Spazzo 's ways annoyed him , and even Praxedis 's jokes , had hurt his feelings . “ In order to humiliate us , ” thought he , “ the Lord has sent over the children of the desert , to be a warning to us , and to teach us , even on the ruins of that which is perishable , to think of that which is eternal ;— the earth which covers the bodies of the slain is still fresh , and those left behind are already jesting , as if all had been but an empty dream . ” ...</p>
   <p>Praxedis had approached him , and now playfully said : “ Why did not you likewise bring home some keepsake from the battle , Professor ? A wonderful , Hunnic amazon is said to have skirmished about there , and if you had caught her , we should now have a nice pair of them . ”</p>
   <p>“ Ekkehard had to think of higher things than Hunnic women , ” said the Duchess bitterly , “ and he knows how to be silent , as one who has taken a vow for that purpose . Why should we need to know , how he fared in battle ! ”</p>
   <p>This cutting speech , deeply wounded the serious-minded man . A jest at the wrong moment , falls like vinegar on honey-dew . Silently he walked out to fetch Sir Burkhard 's sword , and drawing it out of the scabbard , he laid it on the table before the Duchess . Fresh , red spots were still glistening on the noble blade , and the edge showed many a new notch , here and there . “ Whether the schoolmaster was idle all the time , this sword may bear witness ! I have not made my tongue the herald of my deeds ! ”</p>
   <p>The Duchess was startled . She still bore him a grudge in her heart , and she was sorely tempted , to give it vent , in an angry outburst . But the sword of Sir Burkhard called up manifold thoughts . So , restraining her passion , she held out her hand to Ekkehard . “ I did not wish to offend you , ” said she .</p>
   <p>The mildness of her voice was like a reproach to him , and he hesitated to take the proffered hand . He almost wanted to ask her pardon for his roughness , but the words clove to his tongue ,— and at that moment , the door opened , and he was spared the rest .</p>
   <p>Hadumoth , the little geese-driver came in . Shyly she stopped at the door , not venturing to speak . Her face , which was pale from want of sleep , bore the traces of recent tears .</p>
   <p>“ What is the matter with thee , my poor child ? ” called out Dame Hadwig , “ come hither ! ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Then the little maiden came forwards , and kissed the Duchess 's hand .</l>
     <l n="2">She tried to speak , but violent sobs prevented her .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Do n't be afraid , ” said the Duchess soothingly ; upon which she found words and said : “ I cannot take care of the geese any more ; I must go away , and thou must give me a goldpiece , as big as thou hast got . I cannot help it , but I must go ! ”</p>
   <p>“ And why must thou go , my child ? ” asked the Duchess . “ Has anyone wronged thee ? ”</p>
   <p>“ He has not come home again ! ”</p>
   <p>“ There are many who have not come home again ; but thou must not go away on that account . Those who have fallen , are now with our dear Lord in heaven . They are in a large , beautiful garden , and are much happier than we are . ”</p>
   <p>But Hadumoth , shaking her young little head , said : “ Audifax is not with God ; he is with the Huns . I have searched for him down in the valley , and he was not amongst the dead men . Besides , the charcoal-burners ’ boy from Hohenstoffeln , who also went out with the archers , saw himself , how he was taken prisoner . I must go , to fetch him . I can find no peace if I do n't ! ”</p>
   <p>“ But how wilt thou find him ? ”</p>
   <p>“ That , I do n't know . I shall go where the others went . They say that the world is very wide , but in the end I shall find him . I feel sure of it . The goldpiece which thou art to give me , I will give to the Huns , and say : let me have Audifax for this , and when I have got him , we shall both come home again . ”</p>
   <p>Dame Hadwig delighted in all that was extraordinary . “ From that child , we might all learn something ! ” she said , lifting up the shy little Hadumoth to imprint a kiss on her forehead . “ God is with thee , without thy knowing it . Therefore , thy thoughts are great and bold . Who amongst you has a gold coin ? ”</p>
   <p>The Knight of Randegg fetched one out of the depth of his pocket . It was a large golden Thaler , on one side of which could be seen the Emperor Charles with a stern face , and wide open eyes , and on the other a crowned female head . “ It 's my last one , ” said he laughingly , handing it to Praxedis . The Duchess then gave it to the child . “ Go out then , with the Lord ; it is a decree of providence . ”</p>
   <p>All were deeply touched , and Ekkehard put his hands on the little maiden 's head , as if to bless her . “ I thank you ! ” said she , turning to go ; then once more looking round she added : “ but if they will not let me have Audifax , for one goldpiece only ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Then I will give thee another , ” said the Duchess .</p>
   <p>Upon this , the child confidently walked away .</p>
   <p>And Hadumoth really went out into the unknown world . The goldpiece , sewn up in her bodice , her pocket filled with bread , and the staff which Audifax had once cut for her , from the dark green holly-bush , in her hand . That she did not know the way , and that her finding food and a shelter for the night , were doubtful things , she had not time to trouble herself about . The Huns have gone away , towards the setting sun , and have taken him with them , was her sole thought . The flowing Rhine , and the setting sun were her only waymarks , and Audifax her goal .</p>
   <p>By and by , the scenery became strange to her ; the Bodensee looking smaller and narrower in the distance , and foreign hills rising before her , to hide the proud and familiar shape of the hill , which was her home . More than once , did she look back , until she had caught the last glimpse of the Hohentwiel , with its walls and towers steeped in dark blue shadows . Then she entered an unknown valley , grown with dark pine-woods , under the shade of which , low , straw-thatched cottages lay hidden . Nodding a last Goodbye to her Hegau mountains , Hadumoth walked on undauntedly .</p>
   <p>When the sun had gone down to his rest behind the pine-woods , she stopped a while . “ Now they are ringing the bell for evening-prayer at home , ” said she . “ I will pray also . ” So she knelt down in the woody solitude and prayed ; first for Audifax , then for the Duchess , and finally for herself . Everything was silent around her . She only heard her own fast-beating heart .</p>
   <p>“ What will become of my poor geese ? ” thought she next , rising from her knees , “ ‘ tis now the hour to drive them home . ” Then Audifax with whom she had so often returned home of an evening , rose again before her mind and she hurried on .</p>
   <p>In the different farm-yards which she passed in the valley , not a soul was stirring about ; only before one little straw-thatched cottage , an old woman was sitting . “ Thou must take me in for the night , grandmother , ” said Hadumoth coaxingly ; but except a sign that she could remain , she received no answer whatever , for the old woman was deaf . When the people had fled up into the mountains on account of the Huns , she alone had remained behind .</p>
   <p>Before the day had well dawned , Hadumoth had already set out again on her journey . Her road now took her through extensive woods , in which the fir-trees seemed never to come to an end . Here , the first soft touches of spring were already visible . The first flowers were peeping out from the moss ; and the first beetles hovered above them , softly humming ; and the delicious smell of the pine-trees scented the air everywhere , as if it were an incense , which the trees sent up to the sun , to show their gratitude for all which his rays had called up into life , around them .</p>
   <p>The little maiden , however , was not satisfied . “ Here it is far too beautiful , for the Huns to be , ” said she to herself . So , at the first opportunity which offered itself , she turned her back on the mountains , and soon came to an opening in the wood , which afforded a considerable view . Far down , in the distance , the Rhine was winding along , like a serpent . Jammed in between its dividing arms was an island , bearing many a stately tower and wall , as if belonging to a monastery ; but Hadumoth 's sharp eyes discerned that the walls were blackened and spotted , and the roofs all destroyed . A dark-blue cloud of smoke , hung heavily over it .</p>
   <p>“ How do they call the land here ? ” asked she of a man , who was just then emerging from the wood .</p>
   <p>“ Blackforest , ” was the answer .</p>
   <p>“ And over there ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Rheingau . ”</p>
   <p>“ The Huns must have been there ? ”</p>
   <p>“ The day before yesterday . ”</p>
   <p>“ And where are they now ? ”</p>
   <p>The man , leaning on his staff gave a sharp look at the child , and pointing down the Rhine , said , “ and why dost thou ask ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Because I wish to go to them . ” — Upon this he lifted his staff and walked on , murmuring , “ holy Fintan , pray for us ! ”</p>
   <p>Hadumoth also , steadily walked on again . She had noticed from the height , that the Rhine was flowing onwards in large circuits ; so she cut across the mountains , thus to get the start on the Huns . Two days she thus wandered on , sleeping one night in the open air , on the mossy ground , and scarcely meeting a human being all the time . She had to cross however many a wild ravine , and swift-flowing mountain torrent , as well as mighty old pine-trees , which the storm had uprooted . On the same place where they had once stretched their tops towards the sky , they now lay to rot and decay ; emitting a weird , greyish light at night ; but in spite of all terrors and difficulties , she never once lost her courage .</p>
   <p>At last the mountains became less steep , flattening down into an elevated plain , over which the rough winds could sweep at their leisure ; and in the crevices of which the snow was still lying ;— yet she walked on .</p>
   <p>The last piece of bread had been eaten , when from another hill , she again caught sight of the Rhine . So she now turned , to walk towards it , until she came to a narrow chasm , in the depth of which , a foaming mountain-torrent dashed along . A dense mass of brambles and other thorny bushes , grew on the sides of the steep descent , but Hadumoth bravely made for herself a passage through them ; though this cost her no small amount of pain and weariness . The sun was high in the heavens , and the thorns ever and anon , caught hold of her dress ; but whenever her feet grew weary and unwilling to proceed , she said , “ Audifax ! ” and lifted them up again .</p>
   <p>At last she had come to the bottom , and was standing at the foot of dark rocky walls , through which the waters had made a passage ; falling down in a bright , sparkling cascade . The old-looking stones , on which a reddish moss was growing , glistened and shone like burnished gold through the glittering waves , which rose up against them ; alternately covering them up , until they arrested their mad course , a few steps lower down , in a dark-green , transparent little pond , like to a life-wearied man , going to rest , and looking back in quiet contemplation , on the frolics and extravagances of his past life . Luxurious , broad-leaved plants grew around it , on which the spray lay like sparkling dew-drops , whilst blue-winged dragon-flies , hovered above them , as if they were the spirits of dead flowers .</p>
   <p>Dreamily the melodious rustling of the waters crept into the heart of the hungry child . With that brook she must go on , to the Rhine . Everything was wild and entangled , as if never a human being had broken in upon that solitude ... and now a dry , green little nook looked invitingly over at Hadumoth ; and she followed the invitation , and laid herself down . The air was so cool and fresh , and the brook rustled and murmured on , until it had lulled her to sleep . With her head resting on her outstretched right arm , she lay there ; a smile playing on her tired countenance . She was dreaming . Of whom ?— The blue dragonflies betrayed nothing ...</p>
   <p>A slight sprinkling of water awoke her from her dreams , and when she slowly opened her eyes , a man with a long beard , dressed in a coarse linen suit , and with legs bared to the knees , stood before her . Some fishing-tackle , a net and a wooden tub , in which blue-spotted trout were swimming , lay in the grass , beside him . He had thus stood for a considerable time , watching the little sleeper , and doubting whether she were a human child , he sprinkled some water on her , to wake her .</p>
   <p>“ Where am I ? asked Hadumoth , fearlessly .</p>
   <p>“ At the waterfall of Wieladingen , ” replied the fisherman , “ and this water , which contains plenty of fine salmon , is called the Murg , and goes into the Rhine . But whence dost thou come , little maiden ? Hast thou dropt from the sky ? ”</p>
   <p>“ I come from far away , and where I live , the hills are quite different from here . With us , they grow quite straight out of the plain ; each one standing alone ,— and the salmon swim about in the lake , and are much bigger . Hegau , our land is called . ”</p>
   <p>The fisherman shook his head . “ That must be a good way off . And where art thou going to ? ”</p>
   <p>“ To the Huns , ” replied Hadumoth ; and then she told him why she had gone out into the world , and for whom she was searching .</p>
   <p>Upon this the fisherman shook his head again , with redoubled energy . “ By the life of my mother ! ” exclaimed he , “ that is an adventurous expedition ! ” but Hadumoth , folding her hands pleadingly said : “ Fisherman , thou must show me the way to find them . ”</p>
   <p>Then the long-bearded man was touched . “ If it must be , so come along , ” grumbled he . “ They are not very far off . ” Gathering up his fishing-tackle , he followed the course of the brook , accompanied by the little maiden . Whenever the trees and bushes became too much entangled , or when bits of rocks blocked up the way , he took her up in his arms , and carried her through the foaming waters . After leaving the ravine to their right , they soon came to the spur of the hill , at the foot of which the Rhine flows .</p>
   <p>“ Look there , child , ” said he pointing across the river to a low level mountain tract . “ Over there , you get into the Frick-valley at the foot of the Boetzberg . There , they have pitched their camp , after burning the castle of Laufenburg yesterday ... but farther than this , the murderous incendiaries shall not proceed , ” added he fiercely .</p>
   <p>After walking on for a while , Hadumoth 's guide stopped before a projecting rock . “ Wait a bit , ” said he . He then took up some logs of dry fir-wood , that lay about , and heaped them up into a pile , putting some smaller branches of resinous pinewood , between . He did not light it though . The same thing he did again in sundry other places . Hadumoth looked on , but could not guess , why he was doing this . At last they descended to the banks of the Rhine .</p>
   <p>“ Art thou really in earnest about the Huns ? ” asked he once more .</p>
   <p>“ Yes , ” said Hadumoth . Upon this he loosened a small canoe , which had been hidden in the bushes , and rowed her across . On the other side they came right into a wood , which the man entered , always looking carefully about , everywhere . Here also , were piles of wood mixed with resin and covered with green branches . Nodding contentedly he returned to Hadumoth . “ Further than this I cannot accompany thee ; for yonder is the Frick-valley and the Hunnic camp . Take care that they give thee that boy at once ; better to-day , than to-morrow . It might otherwise be too late . And so , may God protect thee ! Thou art a brave child . ”</p>
   <p>“ I thank thee , ” said Hadumoth , pressing his horny hand . “ But why dost thou not come with me ? ”</p>
   <p>“ I shall come later , ” replied the fisherman with a significant look , stepping back into his canoe .</p>
   <p>At the entrance of the valley was the Hunnic camp ; consisting of some tents , and a few larger huts made of branches and straw . The horses were lodged in blockhouses of pine-logs . At the back was a mountain , whilst in front they had made a trench ; fortified by a kind of palisade , made with paling and pieces of rock , in the genuine Hunnic fashion . Their sentinels rode up and down , within a considerable circumference . The reason of their having settled down there for a while , was partly their needing some rest after their late exploits , and partly an intended attack on the convent of St. Fridolin , situated in that neighbourhood . Some of their men , were building ships and rafts on the banks of the Rhine .</p>
   <p>In his tent , lay Hornebog , who was now sole leader since Ellak 's death ; but in spite of all the cushions and carpets heaped up there , he could find no rest . Erica , the flower-of-the-Heath , was sitting by his side , playing with a golden bauble , which she wore round her neck on a silk ribbon .</p>
   <p>“ I do n't know why , ” said Hornebog to her , “ but things have become very uncomfortable . Those bald-headed monks have dealt us rather too heavy blows . We must not be quite so rash in future . Here also , I do not feel quite at my ease , for it is too still , and a calm generally precedes a storm . With thee too , everything is changed , since Ellak was killed . Thou shouldst love me now , as thou didst him , when he was the first leader ; but thou art like a burnt-out fire . ”</p>
   <p>Erica pulled away the jewel with a jerk , so that it rebounded on her bosom with a metallic ring , and softly hummed some Hunnic melody . Then there entered one of the Hunnic sentinels , accompanied by Hadumoth and Snewelin of Ellwangen as interpreter . The child had entered the camp , bravely passing the posts and not heeding their calls , until they stopped her . Snewelin then explained Hadumoth 's wish , with regard to the prisoner boy . He was in as soft and compassionate a mood , as if he were still in his home , and about to celebrate Ash-Wednesday , for he had summed up on that very day , all the misdeeds which he had committed in the course of his Hunnic life ; and the pillaged convents began to weigh heavily on his conscience .</p>
   <p>“ Tell them also , that I can pay them a ransom , ” said Hadumoth , undoing the seam of her bodice to get at the gold piece . She handed it to the chieftain , who laughed immoderately , joined by Erica .</p>
   <p>“ What a crazy land ! ” exclaimed Hornebog , when his laughter had subsided . “ The men cut off their hair , and the children do , what would honour a warrior . If instead of this little maiden , the armed men from the lake had followed us , it would have put us into an awkward position . ”</p>
   <p>A sudden suspicion now crossing his mind , he cast a searching look at the child . “ If she were a spy ! ” ... exclaimed he . But Erica now rose , and patted Hadumoth 's head . “ Thou shalt stay with me , ” said she , “ for I want something to play with , since my black horse is dead , and my Ellak is dead . ” ...</p>
   <p>“ Take the brat away ! ” Hornebog now called out angrily . “ Have we come here , to play with children ? ” Then Erica saw that a storm was brewing in the chieftain 's bosom , and taking the little maiden by the hand , led her out .</p>
   <p>There , where the camp receded towards the mountain , between some sheltering pieces of rock , a temporary cooking-place had been erected , which was the undisputed realm of the woman of the wood . Audifax was kneeling before the biggest of the kettles , blowing into the fire , in which the soup , that was destined for the evening meal , was boiling . But now he jumped up and gave a loud shriek , for he had beheld his little friend . Instantly the old hag stretched out her head , from behind the other kettle , and this was more than a warning . Without moving , he stirred the soup with a peeled branch , as was his prescribed task . Thus he stood , the image of dumb grief . He had become pale and haggard ; and his eyes dimmed by the tears , which had touched nobody . “ Mind , that thou dost not hurt the children , old baboon ! ” cried Erica .</p>
   <p>Then Hadumoth went over to where the boy was , who now dropped his primitive spoon , and silently held out his hand to her ; but out of his dark blue eyes there came a look , which told its own story of woe and suffering , and the longing wish , to regain his liberty . Hadumoth likewise , stood quietly before him . She had often imagined a joyous and touching meeting , but all these pictures had faded away now . The greatest joy sends its gratitude up to heaven , in a voiceless prayer .</p>
   <p>“ Give me a dish of soup Audifax , ” said she , “ I am very hungry . ”</p>
   <p>The woman of the wood suffered him to pour out some soup for her , into a wooden plate , which the hungry child eagerly took . When she had stilled the craving for food , her spirits rose again , and she fearlessly gazed on the wild faces of the Hunnic riders , who came to fetch their soup . Afterwards she sat down close beside Audifax . He was still silent and reserved , and only when it became dark and his tyrant went away , his tongue got loosened . “ Oh , I have so much to tell thee Hadumoth ! ” whispered he . “ I know where the treasure of the Huns is ! The woman of the wood has got it in her keeping . Two big boxes stand under her couch , in yonder hut . I have looked into them myself , and they were quite full of jewels and diadems and golden trinkets . A silver hen , with a brood of chickens , and eggs is also amongst them , which they stole in Lombardy ,— and many more beautiful things . I have paid dearly for seeing them though ... ”</p>
   <p>He lifted up his leathern hat . One half of his right ear had been cut off .</p>
   <p>“ ... The woman of the wood , came home before I could close the lid again . ‘ Take that , for thy reward , ’ said she , lifting her scissors up to my ear . It has hurt me a good deal Hadumoth , but I shall pay her back some day ! ”</p>
   <p>“ I will help thee , ” said his companion .</p>
   <p>For a long time , the two whispered on together ; for no sleep came to the eyes of the happy ones . The noise in the camp was hushed now , and the shadows of night brooded over the valley . Then Hadumoth said : “ I must ever and again , think of that night when the stars fell down . ” Audifax , heaving a sigh , murmured : “ Ah , I shall still get my treasure . I know I shall . ” And again they sat quietly together for a while ; until Audifax gave a violent start . Hadumoth could feel the trembling of his hand . On the other side of the Rhine , on the summit of the black looking mountains , a sudden light shone out . It was like a torch swung around , and then thrown away .</p>
   <p>“ There , it 's gone again ! ” Audifax said softly .</p>
   <p>“ Ah , but look there ! ” affrightedly exclaimed Hadumoth , pointing behind her .</p>
   <p>From the height of the Boetzberg , another flame darted up ; likewise describing a fiery circuit in the air . It was the same signal . And yonder , over in the Blackforest , on the same place where the burning torch had first been visible , there now arose a mighty flame , lighting up the dark , starless night . The guard in the valley , uttered a piercing whistle , and the inhabitants of the camp began to stir everywhere . The woman of the wood came back also , and threateningly called out ; “ what art thou dreaming about boy ? Quick , put the nags to the cart , and saddle my sumpter-horse ! ”</p>
   <p>Audifax silently obeyed her orders .</p>
   <p>The cart stood ready , and the sumpter-horse was tied to a stake . Carefully , the old woman approached it with two panniers , which she hung over its back , and then taking out the two boxes , from her hut , she put one in each , covering them up afterwards , with some hay . When she had done this , she peered out anxiously into the darkness . Everything was quiet again . The wine of the Frick-valley had ensured a sound sleep to the Hunnic warriors .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Tis nothing , ” muttered the woman of the wood , “ we can take the horses back again ; ” but the next moment she started up , almost blinded . The mountains rising behind the camp , had suddenly become alive with hundreds of torches and fire-brands ; and from all sides there resounded the loud and terrific cry of battle . From the Rhine , dark masses of armed men , were swiftly approaching ;— on all the mountain summits , tremendous bonfires were burning .— Up now , ye sleepers !... it was too late , for already the fire-brands came flying into the Hunnic camp . Pitifully sounded the frightened neighing of the horses , whose large shed was already burning . Dark figures stormed the camp on all sides . This time , King Death was coming with blazing torchlight , and he who brought him , was the old Knight Irminger , the owner of the Frickgau . He , the strong father of six strong sons ; who like Mattathias with his Maccabeans , could no longer bear to behold the misery of his people . And with them there came the men of Hornussen and Herznach ; those from the Aarthal and Brugg , as well as from Baden 's hot wells ; and far away from the Gieselafluth . Safely hidden in the dark pine-wood , they had waited until the torch was lifted up on the Eggberg , assuring them of the neighbourly help of the people in the Black-Forest ; and then they rushed to the attack . With bleeding head , Snewelin galloped past . A well-aimed fire-brand , had stuck to his garments , setting them all ablaze , so that he looked like a fiery phantom . “ The world is coming to an end , ” cried he . “ The millenium is at hand ! May God have mercy on my poor soul ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Lost , everything lost , ” muttered the woman of the wood , lifting her hand up to her forehead . Then she untied the sumpter-horse , to harness it likewise before her cart . Meanwhile Audifax was standing in the dark , biting his lips that he might not scream out with delight , at this unexpected turn of affairs . A trembling reflection of the flames , played on his excited countenance . Everything was boiling within him . For some time he stood there , gazing fixedly at the tumult , and the fighting of the dark figures before him . “ Now I know , what I must do , ” whispered he into Hadumoth 's ear . He had taken up a big stone , and springing up at the woman of the wood with the agility of a wild cat , he struck her down . After this he quickly pulled away the sumpter-horse , upon the saddle of which he placed the trembling Hadumoth with the sudden strength of a man . “ Take hold of the pommel ! ” cried he . Then jumping up himself , he seized the reins , and the horse no sooner felt the unwont burden , than it galloped off into the night , frightened by the glare and noise around . Audifax never staggered , though his heart was beating wildly . The blinding smoke made him shut his eyes , and thus they sped onwards ; over the corpses of the dead , and through the crowds of fighting men . After a while the noise became fainter in the distance , and the horse began to slacken its pace . It was taking the children towards the Rhine ,— they were saved !</p>
   <p>Thus they rode on through the long , dark night , scarcely once daring to look about them . Audifax silently held the reins , feeling as if he were in a dream . First he put his hand on Hadumoth 's head , and then struck against one of the boxes , which , emitting a metallic ring , convinced him that he was not dreaming , after all . The horse was good-tempered , and carried its burden willingly enough , across fields , over heaths and through dark woods , always in the direction of the Rhine . When they had thus ridden on for a considerable time , a cool breeze , the messenger of the coming dawn , made them shiver . Hadumoth opened her eyes , “ Where are we ? ” asked she .</p>
   <p>“ I do n't know , ” replied Audifax . And now a roaring and rushing , like distant thunder , struck their ear ; but it could not be from a coming storm , as the sky brightened , whilst the little stars waxed dimmer and slowly vanished . The noise became louder and nearer . They passed a stately castle , looking down proudly into the waters below . Then their path took them round a little hill , and then they suddenly beheld the broad flood of the Rhine ; dashing along with a thundering noise , over dark , weatherbeaten rocks . Clouds of pearly white spray , glistened in the air , whilst soft mists hung around everywhere . The horse stopped , as if it wanted to take in the grand spectacle at its leisure . Then Audifax jumped to the ground , and taking down the tired , little Hadumoth , as well as the two baskets , he allowed the brave animal to graze .</p>
   <p>So the two children stood before the falls of the Rhine ; Hadumoth tightly grasping her companion 's right hand with her left ; gazing long and silently at the spectacle before them . Presently , the sun cast his first rays on the dashing waters , which caught them and built them up into a glittering , many-coloured rainbow .</p>
   <p>Then Audifax went up to the baskets , to take out one of the boxes ; which on being opened , disclosed its glistening contents of pure gold and silver . The long coveted treasure , was found at last ; had become his own ; not by spells and nightly conjurations , but by the use of his hands and by seizing the favourable opportunity . Thus he gazed on the shining baubles without any surprise , for had he not known it for many months , that such a treasure was destined for him ?...</p>
   <p>Of every kind of article it contained , he picked out one ; a casket , a ring , a coin and a bracelet , and with them approached the brink of the waters .</p>
   <p>“ Hadumoth , ” said he , “ here I think that God must be ; for His rainbow is hovering over the waters . I will make Him a thank-offering . ”</p>
   <p>Stepping on a projecting rock , he flung in with a strong hand , first the casket , then the ring , coin and bracelet ,— and then kneeling down , Hadumoth kneeling by his side , they prayed for a long time , and thanked God ....</p>

    <head>CHAPTER XVI .</head>
     <l n="1">Cappan gets married .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>When a thunder-storm has blown over , the water-brooks are still turbid and muddy ; and so , a great stirring event , is generally followed by a time of small and annoying work , until everything has returned to its old routine .</p>
   <p>This experience , Dame Hadwig was forced to make also . There was a great deal to arrange and put in order , after the driving away of the Huns ; but this she did willingly enough , as her lively spirit and the pleasure she took in active interference , quite made up to her , for the trouble this gave her .</p>
   <p>The widows and orphans of the slain arrier-ban-men , as well as all those whose houses had been burnt , and whose harvests had been destroyed , came to sue for assistance . Help was given to every one , as far as this was possible . Messengers were sent off to the Emperor , to report that which had happened , as well as to make proposals , for taking the necessary precautions against any possible future invasion . Wherever the fortress was found deficient , improvements were made ; the booty was distributed , and finally the erection of a chapel on the grave of the christian warriors , was decided upon . With Reichenau and St. Gall , there was also a good deal of business to transact , for ecclesiastics seldom forget to present their bills , for any services that they have rendered . They well knew how to bemoan and bewail the damages done to their monasteries , as well as the great loss of goods and chattels , which they had experienced ; and every day some delicate hint was dropped to the Duchess , that a donation of land , would be most desirable for the afflicted servants of God . Far away in the Rhine-valley , where the Breisach-mountain with its dark , scorched rocks , narrows the bed of the river , the Duchess owned some property , called Saspach . On a vulcanic soil the vine thrives particularly well ,— so this would have suited the pious brothers of the Reichenau admirably ; if it were only to find out the difference , between the Rhine-wines and those that grew near the lake ; besides its being some slight compensation for their military services , and for the reciting of the necessary masses for the souls of the dead .</p>
   <p>One day , on which Dame Hadwig had not appeared quite disinclined to make the donation , was followed by the arrival of the subprior in the early morning , bringing a parchment with him , on which , the whole formula of the donation was written down . It sounded really very well when read aloud , how everything was to be given to St. Pirminius ; house and yard , with all that was in it ; cultivated and uncultivated land ; woods and vineyards ; meadows and brooks , with the right of building mills and of fishing ; as well as the vassals , both male and female , who were living there ... even the customary curse was not wanting , and ran as follows : “ If anyone should dare to doubt the donation , or , worse still , to try and rob the monastery of it , the Anathema Marantha , shall be pronounced on him . The anger of God Almighty , and all the holy angels shall fall on him . May he be stricken with leprosy , like Naaman the Syrian , and with sudden death like Ananias and Sapphira , besides paying a fine of a pound of gold to the exchequer in expiation of his crime . ”</p>
   <p>“ The Lord Abbot , wanted to save our gracious sovereign the trouble of writing the donation herself , ” said the Subprior . “ There has been left an empty space , for adding the name and boundaries of the property ; as well as for the signatures of both parties , and the necessary witnesses . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Have you learned to be so quick in all your doings ? ” replied Dame</l>
     <l n="2">Hadwig . “ I will look at that parchment of yours , some day or other . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ But it would be a very dear and desirable thing for the Abbot , if I could bring him back the deed , signed and sealed by your Highness , to-day . It is only on account of the order and precision in the monastery 's archives , the Abbot said . ”</p>
   <p>Dame Hadwig , casting a haughty look at the man , then said : “ Tell your Abbot , that I am just now summing up the account , of how much the quartering of the brothers on the Hohentwiel , has cost me in kitchen and cellar . Tell him likewise that we have our own scriveners , if we should feel so inclined , to give away landed property on the Rhine , and that ” ... she wanted to add a few more bitter words , but the Subprior here fell in coaxingly , telling her a number of cases where Christian kings and princes had done the same . How the King of France for instance , had generously indemnified St. Martin of Tours , for the losses which he had suffered through the Norman invasion ; and how beneficial the donation had been for the giver 's soul ; for as fire was extinguished by water , thus the soul was purified by alms-giving .... But the Duchess , turning her back on him , left him standing there in the hall , with his many yet untold examples , on the tip of his tongue .</p>
   <p>“ Too much zeal , is an evil thing , ” muttered the monk , “ ‘ the greater hurry , the less speed , ’ as the proverb has it . ” Dame Hadwig having reached the entrance , turned round once more , and with an indescribable movement of the hand , now said : “ If you wish to go , you had better go at once ! ”</p>
   <p>So he made his retreat .</p>
   <p>To annoy the Abbot , the Duchess , on the very same day , sent a golden chain to the venerable Simon Bardo , in acknowledgement of his prosperous leadership .</p>
   <p>The fate of Cappan , the Hunnic prisoner , was a matter of special interest to the Duchess . At first he had spent some anxious days . He did not then understand why his life had been spared , and he walked shyly about , like one who has no just claim to himself ; and when he slumbered on his couch of straw , evil dreams came to him . Then he saw large flowery plains , on which numberless gallows were growing like thistles , and on every one of them , hung one of his countrymen , and he himself was suspended from the highest of all ; and he could not find fault with this , as it was the usual fate allotted to war-prisoners in those days . No gallows however , were erected for him . For some time he still cast sundry suspicious glances at the linden-tree in the courtyard , which had a nice leafless branch ; and he fancied sometimes that this branch was beckoning to him , and saying : “ Heigho ! how well thou wouldst adorn me ! ”</p>
   <p>By degrees , however , he found out , that the lime was merely , a fine shady tree , and so he became less timid . His wounded foot was now healed and he wandered about in yard and kitchen , looking on with mute astonishment at the doings of a German household . It is true , he still thought that a man 's home , ought to be the back of his horse ; and that a skin-covered cart sufficed for women and children ; but when it rained , or the evenings were cool , the hearth-fire and the sheltering walls did not appear altogether despicable to him . Besides this , he began to find out , that wine was better than mare 's milk , and a woollen jacket softer than a wolf 's skin . So his wish to fly , dwindled away , and homesickness could not attack him , as a home was an unknown luxury to him .</p>
   <p>In those days , a maiden worked in house and garden , whose name was Friderun ; and her figure resembled a many-storeyed building with a pointed roof ; her head having the shape of a pear . The first freshness of youth , had for some time passed away from her , and when she opened her broad mouth for speech or laughter , a single long tooth became visible , indicative of her mature state . Evil tongues , were wont to whisper , that she had once been Master Spazzo 's sweetheart ; but that was long ago , as her affections had been bestowed these many years on a herdsman , who had met his death in the ranks of the arrier-ban , by some Hunnic arrow ,— and so her heart was lonely now . Very tall people are generally goodnatured , and do not suffer under the evil consequences of too much thinking . So she cast her eyes on the Hun , who was slinking about all alone in the courtyard , and her compassionate heart fastened on him , like a glistening dew-drop on a toad-stool . She tried to instruct him in all the arts which she practised herself ; and often when she had weeded the garden and dug the ground , she would give the hoe to Cappan , who willingly did what he had seen his instructress do before him . In the same way he followed her example when he saw her gathering beans or herbs , and after a few days , whenever water was to be fetched , the slender Friderun had only to point at the wooden pail , to make Cappan take it up on his head , and walk down with it to the splashing fountain .</p>
   <p>Only in the kitchen they had no reason to be oversatisfied , with the docile pupil 's achievements ; for one day when a piece of game was entrusted to him , to beat tender with a wooden drumstick , old memories arose in his mind ; and so he devoured part of it quite raw , along with the onions and leek , which had been prepared for seasoning the meat .</p>
   <p>“ I really believe , that my prisoner pleases thee , ” Master Spazzo called out one day to her , when the Hun was busily splitting wood in the courtyard . A deep blush covered the cheeks of the tall one , who cast down her eyes . “ If he could only speak German , and were not a damned heathen ” ... continued Master Spazzo , but the slender maiden was too bashful to speak .</p>
   <p>“ I know how well thou deservest to be made happy Friderun , ” Master Spazzo began again . Then Friderun 's tongue was loosened . “ With regard to the speaking of German , ” — said she , still looking down ,— “ I really should not mind that so much ; and as for his being a heathen , I do not see why he need remain one . But ... ”</p>
   <p>“ But what ? ”</p>
   <p>“ He cannot sit down like a decent human being , when he eats . If he is to enjoy his meals , he must always be stretched out on the ground . ”</p>
   <p>“ That , a spouse like thee , would soon cure him of . How is it , hast thou already some sort of understanding on this subject with him ? ”</p>
   <p>Friderun again held her tongue , and suddenly ran away like a frightened deer ; her wooden shoes clattering over the stone flags . Master Spazzo then walked up to the wood-splitting Cappan , and clapping him first on the back to make him look up , he pointed with his forefinger at the flying Friderun , nodded his head interrogatively , and looked at him sharply . Cappan first pressed his right arm to his breast , bowed his head , and then jumped high up in the air , so that he spun round like the terrestrial globe on its axis , and finally stretched his mouth into a broad , joyous grin .</p>
   <p>Master Spazzo could now see well enough , how matters stood , with both of them . Friderun however , had not witnessed the Hun 's demonstrations of joy . Heavy doubts were still weighing on her soul ; therefore she had gone out of the castle-gate . There , she plucked a wild flower , and was now eagerly pulling off the white leaflets , one after the other , murmuring , “ he loves me , loves me not , he loves me . ” When all had become a prey to the winds , her murmur ceased , and looking with beaming eyes , at the stalk with its last remaining white leaf , she smilingly nodded her head at it .</p>
   <p>Meanwhile , Spazzo the chamberlain , expounded the case to the Duchess , whose active mind at once took up the idea of settling Cappan 's fate . The Hun had given proofs of understanding many a useful art in the garden . He well knew for instance , how to stop the cunning subterranean digging of the moles . With bent willow-boughs , at the end of which a nooze was fastened , he had contrived an untimely end , for many a one of the black little animals . In one and the same moment , they were jerked up to sunlight , gallows and death . He also manufactured excellent traps for mice , in short he showed himself an able huntsman , in all that regarded the lowest kind of sport .</p>
   <p>“ We will give him some acres of land , at the foot of the Stoffler-mountain , ” said Dame Hadwig , “ in return for which , he can wage war against all obnoxious and injurious animals , as far as our land goes ; and if the tall Friderun really likes him , she can have him ; for I very much doubt whether any other of the maidens of this land , has cast loving eyes on him . ”</p>
   <p>So , she told Ekkehard to prepare the prisoner , for baptism , in order that he might be received as a member into the Christian community ; and when he shook his head , rather doubtfully , Dame Hadwig added : “ The good will must here make up , for that which is wanting , in the understanding . The instruction you can make short , for he , no doubt , will understand as much as the Saxons did , whom the great Emperor Charles , had driven into the Weser . ”</p>
   <p>Ekkehard did as he was told , and his instruction fell on good soil . Cappan had picked up many a German word , in the course of his warlike expedition , and had in common with all his countrymen , a great talent for guessing what was required of him , even when the words had not been quite understood . Signs and tokens , also helped a good deal ; for when Ekkehard sat before him , with the open bible with golden initials on his knee , and pointed heavenwards , the Hun knew of what he was speaking . The likeness of the devil he also understood , and indicated by gestures , that he was to be abhorred , and before the sign of the cross , he fell on his knees , as he had seen done by others . In this way the instruction was carried on .</p>
   <p>When Cappan had also made progress in expressing himself , it came out , that his past life had really been a very bad one . He nodded in the affirmative , when asked whether he had taken pleasure in the destruction of churches and monasteries , and from the number of his outstretched fingers , it became evident , that he had assisted more than once , at such sacrilege . With evident signs of sincere repentance , he confessed to having once eaten part of a slain priest 's heart , in order to cure himself of fever . In expiation , he now diligently learned to express his guilt in words , and whenever a word was missing , Friderun helped him . So , in a short time , Ekkehard could declare himself satisfied ; though his mind certainly had not yet taken in all that St. Augustine requires , in his book on the teaching of infidels . The same day was then fixed upon , for both baptism and wedding . According to the Duchess 's desire , he was to have three godfathers ; one from Reichenau , one from St. Gall , and a third from the arrier-ban , in remembrance of the battle in which he had been taken prisoner . Those of the Reichenau , sent Rudimann the cellarer , whilst the arrier-ban was represented by Master Spazzo ; and because the god-fathers could not make up their minds , whether the converted should be called Pirminius in honour of the Reichenau , or Gallus , they brought the case before the Duchess , to abide by her decision . She said : “ Call him Paul , for he also has gone out breathing fury and vengeance against the disciples of the Lord , until the scales were taken from his eyes . ”</p>
   <p>It was on a Saturday , when the godfathers led Cappan , who had fasted during the whole day , to the castle-chapel , and they alternately spent the night with him , in prayer . The Hun was resigned and devout , and on the whole in a becoming frame of mind . He believed that the spirit of his mother , dressed in lambs ’ skins , had appeared to him , saying : “ Poor son , thy bow is broken , and thou no more canst flee ; and those who have disarmed thee , thy masters now shall be . ”</p>
   <p>Early , on Sunday morning , when the pearly dewdrops were still hanging on the grass , and the first lark was soaring up to the bright blue sky , a small troop , bearing a cross and flag , marched down the hill ,— this time no funeral train !</p>
   <p>Ekkehard walked in front , dressed in a purple priest 's garment , and behind him came the Hun , between his two god-fathers . Thus they walked through the luxurious meadow-lands , down to the shores of the little river Aach . Arrived there , they stuck the cross into the white sand , and then formed a semi-circle round him who for the last time , was to be called Cappan . In the quiet of that Sabbath morning , the clear notes of the litany rose up to God , imploring Him , to look down mercifully on the man who was now bending his head before Him , longing for deliverance from the yoke of heathendom and sin .</p>
   <p>Then they told him to undress down to the belt . He was kneeling on the sand , whilst Ekkehard pronounced the exorcism over him , in the name of Him whom angels and archangels adore ; before whom the heavens and earth tremble and abysses open . He then breathed three times on his forehead , and putting some consecrated salt into his mouth , as a symbol of new wisdom and new thoughts , he anointed his forehead and breast with holy oil . The Hun was perfectly awed , scarcely daring to breathe ; so much the solemnity of the action impressed him , and when Ekkehard asked him , in the words of the prescribed formula : “ Dost thou renounce the Devil and all his works and doings ? ” he replied with a clear voice : “ I renounce him ! ” and then repeated the words of the creed , as well as he could . Upon this , Ekkehard immersed him in the river ; the baptism was pronounced , and the new Paul rose from the waters .... One melancholy look he cast at the fresh mound on the newly dug grave , at the border of the wood ,— then his god-fathers drew him out , and wrapped his trembling form , in a dazzling white linen garment . Proudly he stood amongst his new brothers . Ekkehard then preached a short sermon , on the text , “ He is blessed who taketh good care of his garments , so that he shall not be found naked , ” and exhorted him to wear this spotless linen , in sign of his regeneration from sin to godliness , wrought in him by baptism ; and finally he laid both hands on his head . With loud-sounding jubilant hymns , they led back the new christian to the castle .</p>
   <p>In the arched window embrasure , in one of the basement chambers , the tall Friderun had been sitting meanwhile ; Praxedis gliding about her like an unstable will-o ’ - the-wisp . She had sued the Duchess 's permission , to array the awkward bride , on this her day of honour . Her hair was already entwined with red ribbons , and the apron with its wonderful amount of folds , falling down to the high-heeled shoes , was put on . Over this was fastened the dark belt with its gilt border ,— only he who wins the bride may unclasp it ,— and now Praxedis took up the glittering crown , bedecked with innumerable coloured glass beads , and tinsel gold .</p>
   <p>“ Holy mother of God , ” exclaimed she , “ must this also be put on ? If thou walkest along in that head-gear , they will believe in the distance , that some tower had sprung into life , and was going to be wedded . ”</p>
   <p>“ It must be , ” said Friderun .</p>
   <p>“ And why must it be ? ” said the Greek . “ I have seen many a smart bride at home , wearing the myrtle wreath , or the silver-green olive branch in her locks , and it was well so . To be sure , neither myrtle nor olive grows in these dark , gloomy fir-woods of yours , but ivy would be pretty also , Friderun ? ”</p>
   <p>But she turned round angrily on her chair . “ Rather not marry at all , than go to church with leaves and grass in my hair , ” replied she . “ That may do well enough for foreigners , but when a Hegau maiden , goes to her wedding , the Schappel-crown must adorn her head . Thus it has always been , ever since the Rhine flowed through the Bodensee , and the mountains have stood here . We Suabians are a princely race , as my father said many a time . ”</p>
   <p>“ Your will shall be done , ” said Praxedis , fastening the spangled crown on her head .</p>
   <p>The tall bride arose , but a frown had gathered on her forehead , like a fleeting cloud , that throws its shadow on a sunny plain .</p>
   <p>“ Wilt thou cry now already , so that the tears may be spared thee in wedlock ? ” asked the Greek .</p>
   <p>Friderun made a serious face , and the ungracious mouth assumed a very sorrowful expression , so that Praxedis had some difficulty in restraining a laugh .</p>
   <p>“ I feel so depressed , ” said the bride of the Hun .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ And what is depressing thee , future rival of the pine-trees on the</l>
     <l n="2">Stoffler-mountain ? ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ I am afraid that the young men will play me some trick , because I marry a foreigner . When the convent-farmer of the Schlangenhof , brought home the old widow from Bregenz wood , they went to his house on the wedding-night , and with bull 's horns , brass kettles and sea-shells made such a terrible noise , as if a hail-storm was to be frightened away ; and when the miller of Rielasingen came out of the house , on the first morning after his marriage , they had put a dry and withered May-pole before his door , and instead of flowers and ribbons , a wisp of straw and a ragged apron , hang from it . ”</p>
   <p>“ Be sensible , ” said Praxedis , soothingly .</p>
   <p>But Friderun would not take comfort , and dolefully went on , “ and what , if they should treat me , like the gamekeeper 's widow , when she married the apprentice boy ? Her roof was cut intwain during the night , so that one half fell down to the right and one to the left ; and the starry sky shone into their marriage-bed ; and the rooks flew about their heads , without their knowing why and wherefore . ”</p>
   <p>Praxedis laughed . “ I hope that thou hast got a good conscience , Friderun ? ” said she significantly ; but Friderun was now very nearly crying .</p>
   <p>“ And who knows , ” said she evasively , “ what my Cappan ... ”</p>
   <p>“ Paul , ” Praxedis corrected her .</p>
   <p>“ ... may have done in his younger days . Last night I dreamt that he held me close in his arms , when suddenly a Hunnic woman , with yellow face and black hair , came and tore him away . ‘ He is mine , ’ cried she , and when I did not let him go , she became a serpent , and tightly coiled herself around him . ”</p>
   <p>“ Leave alone serpents and Hunnic women now , ” interrupted Praxedis , “ and get thyself ready , for they are already coming up the hill . Do n't forget the sprig of rosemary , and the white handkerchief . ”</p>
   <p>Cappan 's white garment shone out brightly in the courtyard , and so Friderun gave the slip to all foreboding thoughts , and walked out . The bride'shYpppHeNmaids welcomed her outside ; he who had just been baptized , laughed at her with his whole face ; the chapel-bell rang out merrily , and so they went to be married .</p>
   <p>The religious ceremony was over , and the new couple walked out of the castle-yard with beaming faces . Friderun 's kith and kin had come ; strong healthy-looking people ; who , as regarded bodily height , did not fall short of Friderun . They were farmers and yeomen on the neighbouring lands , and had come to help in lighting the first fire on the new hearth , at the foot of the Hohenstoffeln , and to celebrate the wedding in all due form . On a cart decorated with garlands , which headed the train , the bride 's outfit was to be seen . There , the huge bedstead of pine-wood was not missing , on which roses and magic signs were painted ; meant to drive away night-mares , goblins and other nightly sprites . Besides this , there were still sundry boxes and trunks , containing the necessary household articles .</p>
   <p>The bride'shYpppHeNmaids carried the distaff , with the bundle of flax , and the prettily adorned bridal broom , made of white birch twigs ; simple emblems of industry and order for the future household .</p>
   <p>Loud shouts of joy and merriment were not wanting either , and Cappan felt , as if the baptismal floods had swept away all recollection of his having ever governed , and lived on the back of a swift-footed horse . Decently and soberly , he walked along with his new relations , as if he had been a bailiff , or magistrate of Hegau , since his youth . Before the noise of the merry-makers going down the hill , had died away , two nice-looking lads , the sons of the steward at the imperial castle of Bodmann , and cousins of Friderun , appeared before the Duchess and her guests . They came to invite them to the wedding ; each with a cowslip stuck behind his ear , and a nosegay in his button-hole .</p>
   <p>Somewhat embarrassed , they remained standing at the entrance , until the Duchess made them a sign to approach , upon which they walked on a few steps , stopped again , and scraping a deep bow , they spoke the old customary words of the invitation to the wedding-feast of their cousin , begging her , to follow them over dale and vale , roads and moats , bridges and water to the house of the wedding . There she would find some vegetables , such as the good God had given . A tun would be tapped , and violins ringing , a dancing and singing , jumping and springing . “ We beseech you , to accept two bad messengers for one good one . Blessed be Jesus Christ ! ” so they concluded their speech , and without waiting for the answer , they scraped another bow , and quickly hurried away .</p>
   <p>“ Shall we give the honour of our presence , to the youngest of our christian subjects , ” gaily asked Dame Hadwig . The guests well knew , that questions which were so graciously put , must not be answered in the negative . So they all rode over in the afternoon . Rudimann , the deputy of St. Pirmin 's monastery , accompanied them ; but he was silent and watchful . His account with Ekkehard had not yet been settled .</p>
   <p>The Stoffler-mountain , with its three basalt pinnacles , feathered with stately pine-trees looks proudly down over the land . The castle , whose ruins now crown its summit , was not built then ; only on the highest of the three points stood a deserted tower . Somewhat lower down , on a projecting part of the hill , there was a modest little house , hidden amongst the trees , which was to be the domicile of the newly married pair . As a tribute , and sign that the owner of the house was the Duchess 's vassal , it was decreed that he should furnish every year fifty moles ’ skins , and on the day of St. Gallus a live wren .</p>
   <p>On a green meadow in the woods , the wedding-party had erected their camp . In large kettles and pans , a tremendous cooking and frying was going on ; and he who could not get some dish or plate , feasted off a wooden board ; and where a fork was wanting , a double pointed hazel-wand , was installed in its place .</p>
   <p>Cappan had made an effort to sit decently and upright by the side of his spouse ; but in the depth of his mind , he was revolving the thought , whether after some time , he could not resume his old custom , of lying down during meal-times .</p>
   <p>During the long intervals between the different dishes ,— for though the repast had begun at midday , it was to last until sunset ,— the Hun rested his limbs , which had been tortured by the continual sitting .</p>
   <p>Welcomed by the sounds of the rustic musical band , the Duchess with her train , now approached , on horseback . Stopping her palfrey , she looked down into the crowd of merry-makers , amongst which the new Paul was shewing off his wild antics . The music , not being sufficient for him , he shouted and whistled his own time , wheeling his tall spouse about , in a labyrinthine dance . It looked like a walking tower , dancing with a wild cat ; the slow one , dancing with the swift ; now together , then apart ; now breast to breast , then back to back . Sometimes he would suddenly thrust his partner away , and beating his wooden shoes together in the air , he made seven capers , one always higher than the other ; and finally dropping on his knees before Dame Hadwig , he bowed his head as if he would kiss the dust , which her horse 's hoofs had touched . This was the expression of his gratitude .</p>
   <p>His Hegau cousins , looking on at this wonderful dancing , conceived the laudable desire of emulation , and perhaps later , they had themselves instructed in the art ; for one still hears a legendary account of the “ seven capers , ” or the Hunnic “ hop ” in those parts , which as a variation from the customary monotonous Suabian round-dances , had since those days , become the crowning feat of all festivals .</p>
   <p>“ Where is Ekkehard ? ” asked the Duchess , who after getting down from her palfrey , had walked through the ranks of her subjects . Praxedis pointed over to some shady spot , where a gigantic pine-tree lifted its dark-green top towards the sky . On its knotty , rugged roots , the monk was sitting . The loud merriment of the crowd of people oppressed his heart , though he could not tell why . So he had gone aside , and was dreamily gazing at the faint distant outlines of the Alps , rising over the woody hills .</p>
   <p>It was one of those soft , balmy evenings , such as Sir Burkhart of Hohenvels enjoyed in later times from his huge tower on the lake ; “ when the air is tempered and mixed up with sun-fire . ” The distance was shrouded in a soft glowing haze . He , who has ever looked down from those quiet mountain-tops , when on a bright , radiant day , the sun is slowly sinking down , arrayed in all the splendour of his royal robes ; when heaven and earth are palpitating with warmth and light , whilst dark purple shadows , fill up the valleys , and a margin-glory , like liquid gold illumines the snowy alpine peaks ,— he will not easily forget that aspect ; and perchance when sitting later , within his dusky walls , the memory of it will rise in his heart , as soft and bewitchingly sweet , as a song uttered in the melting tones of the South .</p>
   <p>Ekkehard was sitting there , with a serious expression on his countenance ; his head supported by his right hand .</p>
   <p>“ He is no longer as he used to be , ” said Dame Hadwig to the Greek maid .</p>
   <p>“ He is no longer , as he used to be , ” thoughtlessly repeated Praxedis , for she was intently gazing on the women of the Hegau , in their holiday-garments ; and whilst scrutinizing those high , stiff bodices ; and tun-like , starched skirts , she wondered whether the genius of good taste , had left that land for ever in despair ,— or whether his foot had never entered it .</p>
   <p>Dame Hadwig now approached Ekkehard . He started up from his mossy seat , as if he saw a ghost .</p>
   <p>“ All alone , and away from the merry-makers ? ” asked she . “ What are you doing here ? ”</p>
   <p>“ I am thinking , where real happiness may be found , ” replied Ekkehard .</p>
   <p>“ Happiness ? ” repeated the Duchess . “ ‘ Fortune is a fickle dame , who seldom stays long anywhere , ’ says the proverb . Has she never paid you a visit ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Probably not , ” said the monk , riveting his eyes on the ground . With renewed vigour , the music and noise of the dancers struck the ear .</p>
   <p>“ Those who lightly tread the green meadowlands , and know how to express with their feet , what oppresses their hearts , are happy , ” continued he . “ Perhaps one requires very little to be happy ; but above all , ” — pointing over to the distant , glittering Alpine peaks ,— “ there must be no distant heights which our feet may never hope to reach . ”</p>
   <p>“ I do not understand you , ” coldly said the Duchess , but her heart thought otherwise than her tongue . “ And how fares your Virgil , ” said she , changing the conversation . “ During those days of anxiety and warfare , I am afraid that dust and cobwebs will have settled on it . ”</p>
   <p>“ He will always find a refuge in my heart , even if the parchment should decay , ” replied he . “ Only a few moments ago , his verses in praise of agriculture , passed through my mind . Yonder the little house , nestling in the shade-giving trees ; down below , the dark fertile fields ; and a newly wedded pair , going to earn their bread with hoe and plough from kind mother Earth . With a feeling almost of envy , Virgil 's picture rose before me : ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Simple and artless , his life is with many a blessing surrounded ,</l>
     <l n="2">Rich with many a joy , and peaceful rest after labour ,</l>
     <l n="3">Grottoes and shady retreats , affording a shelter for slumber . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ You well know , how to adapt his verses to life , ” said Dame Hadwig , “ but I fear , that your envy has made you forget Cappan 's duties of destroying the moles , and the obnoxious field-mice . And then the joys of winter ! when the snow rises like a wall up to the straw-thatched roof , so that daylight is sorely perplexed through what chink or crevice , it may creep into the house . ” ...</p>
   <p>“ Even such a dilemma , I could bear with composure , and Virgil too , knows how this may be done . ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Many a one , in the winter , will sit by the glare of the fire ,</l>
     <l n="2">Late in the evening then ; the light-giving torches preparing ,—</l>
     <l n="3">During the time that his wife his favourite ditties is singing ,</l>
     <l n="4">Throwing the shuttle along , with a dexterous hand through the</l>
     <l n="5">texture . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">“ His wife ? ” maliciously asked the Duchess . “ But if he has got no</l>
     <l n="7">wife ? ” —</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>From the other side there now arose a loud shout of delighted laughter . They had put their Hunnic cousin on a board , and were carrying him high above their heads ; as they used to carry the newly chosen king on his shield , in the olden days of election . Even in this elevated position , he made some gleeful capers .</p>
   <p>“ And may not have a wife ? ” said Ekkehard absently . His forehead was burning . He covered it with his right hand . Wherever he looked , the sight pained him . Yonder , the loud joy of the wedding-guests ; here the Duchess , and in the distance , the glittering mountains . An inexpressible pain was gnawing at his heart ; but his lips remained closed . “ Be strong and silent , ” he said to himself .</p>
   <p>He was in reality no longer as he used to be . The undisturbed peace of his lonely cell had forsaken him . The late battle , as well as all the excitement , brought on by the Hunnic invasion , had widened his thoughts ; and the signs of favour which the Duchess had shown him , had called up a fierce conflict in his heart . By day and by night , he was haunted by the recollection , how she had stood before him , hanging the relic round his neck , and giving him the sword , that had been her husband 's ; and in evil moments , self-reproaches ,— misty and unexpressed as yet ,— that he had received these gifts so silently , passed through his troubled soul . Dame Hadwig had no idea of all that was stirring in his heart . She had accustomed herself to think more indifferently of him , since she had been humiliated by his apparently not understanding her ; but as often as she saw him again , with his noble forehead clouded by grief , and with that mute appealing look in his eyes ,— then the old game began afresh .</p>
   <p>“ If you take such delight in agricultural pursuits , ” said she lightly , “ I can easily help you to that . The Abbot of Reichenau has provoked me . To think of asking for the pearl of my estates , as if it were a mere crumb of bread , which one shakes down from the table-cloth , without so much as looking at it ! ”</p>
   <p>Here something rustled in the bushes behind them , but they did not notice it . A dark brown colour might have been seen between the foliage . Was it a fox , or a monk 's garment ?—</p>
   <p>“ I will appoint you steward of it , ” continued Dame Hadwig . “ Then you will have all that , the lack of which has made you melancholy to-day ; and far more still . My Saspach is situated on the merry old Rhine , and the Kaiserstuhl boasts the honour , that it was the first to bear the vine in our lands . The people are honest and good thereabouts , though they speak rather a rough language . ”</p>
   <p>Ekkehard 's eyes were still resting on the ground .</p>
   <p>“ I can also give you a description of your life there ; though I have not Virgil 's talent for painting . Fancy that autumn has come . You have led a healthy life ; getting up with the sun , and going to bed with the chickens ,— and so vintage-time has arrived . From all sides men and maids are descending , with baskets full of ripe , luscious grapes . You stand at the door looking on ... ”</p>
   <p>Again the rustling was heard .</p>
   <p>“ ... and wondering how the wine will be , and whose health , you are going to drink in it . The Voges-mountains seem to wink over at you , as bright and blue , as the Alps do from here ; and as you are gazing at them , you see a cloud of dust rising on the highroad from Breisach . Soon after , horses and carriages become visible , and — well , Master Ekkehard , who is coming ? ”</p>
   <p>Ekkehard who had scarcely followed her recital , shyly said , “ who ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Who else , but your mistress , who will not give up her sovereign right of examining her subjects doings ! ”</p>
   <p>“ And then ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Then ? then I shall gather information about how Master Ekkehard has been fulfilling his duties ; and they will all say : ‘ he is good and earnest , and if he would not think and brood quite so much , and not read so often in his parchments , we should like him still better . ’ ” ...</p>
   <p>“ And then ? ” asked he once more . His voice sounded strange .</p>
   <p>“ Then I shall say in the words of Scripture : ‘ well done , thou good and faithful servant ; thou hast been faithful over a few things , I will make thee ruler over many things . ’ ”</p>
   <p>Ekkehard stood there like one , but half conscious . He lifted one arm , and let it fall again . A tear trembled in his eye . He was very unhappy .</p>
   <p>... At the same time , a man softly crept out , from the bushes . As soon as he felt the grass again under his feet , he let his habit , which had been gathered up , drop down . Looking stealthily back once more at the two , standing there , he shook his head , like one who has made a discovery . He had certainly not gone into the bushes , to gather violets .</p>
   <p>The wedding-feast , by slow stages had got to that point , where a general chaos threatens . The mead was having its effect , on the different minds . One , hung his upper garment on a tree , feeling an almost irresistible inclination to smash everything ; whilst another strove to embrace everybody . A third , who remembered having culled many a kiss from Friderun 's cheek , ten years ago , sat gloomily at the table , where he had emptied many a goblet , and looking down at the ants , that crept about on the floor , said to himself : “ Heigho ! None of them is worth a straw . ” — The two youths , who had looked so very shy in the morning , when they came to invite the Duchess , were now playing an Allemannic trick , on their Hunnic kinsman . They had dragged a large linen sheet out of one of the wedding trunks . On this they placed the unfortunate Cappan , and then taking hold of the four corners , they jerked him up into the air . The victim of this trick , taking this treatment as a mark of friendship and respect , customary in those parts , submitted with perfect good grace , swinging himself gaily up and down .</p>
   <p>Suddenly the tall Friderun gave a loud shriek , upon which all heads were turned round to see what might have caused it . The two cousins almost let fall the sheet , when a shout of delight broke forth , so loud and uproarious , that even the old fir-grown basalt rocks , were probably surprised by it ; used though they were , to the noise of tempests and storms .</p>
   <p>Audifax and Hadumoth were there , on their way back from the Huns , and had been discovered first by the tall bride . Audifax led the horse that carried the treasure-boxes , by the reins , and with beaming faces , the two children walked side by side . That day they had once more beheld the top of the Hohentwiel , and had greeted it with a shout of delight . “ Do n't tell them everything , ” whispered Audifax , putting long willow-branches over the panniers .</p>
   <p>Friderun was the first who ran to meet them , and snatching Hadumoth up from the ground , she carried her off in triumph .</p>
   <p>“ Welcome ye lost-ones ! Drink bag-piper , drink my boy ! ” so they cried on all sides , for they all knew of his captivity , and held out the huge stone-jugs in sign of welcome .</p>
   <p>The children had agreed together on the road , in what way they should accost the Duchess , when they came home .</p>
   <p>“ We must thank her very prettily , ” Hadumoth had said . “ And I must give her back the gold Thaler . I got Audifax for nothing , I shall tell her . ”</p>
   <p>“ No we will add to it still two of the biggest gold coins , ” Audifax had replied . “ This we will present , begging her to remain our gracious mistress as before . That shall be our thanks , as well as the fine , for my having slain the woman of the wood . ”</p>
   <p>So they had got the gold all ready prepared .</p>
   <p>They now caught sight of the Duchess , standing with Ekkehard under the pine-tree . The wild burst of joy had interrupted their agricultural conversation . Praxedis came bounding along , to impart the wondrous news , and following on her heels , the two youthful runaways , walked hand in hand . They both knelt down before Dame Hadwig ; Hadumoth holding up her Thaler , and Audifax his two big gold coins . He tried to speak , but his voice failed him .... Then Dame Hadwig , with lofty grace , addressed the surrounders .</p>
   <p>“ The silliness of my two young subjects , affords me an opportunity , to give them a proof of my favour . Be witnesses thereof . ”</p>
   <p>Breaking off a hazel-wand from a neighbouring bush , she approached the children , and after first shaking the golden coins out of their hands , so that they flew into the grass , she touched their heads with the branch , saying : “ Arise , and in future scissors shall never cut off your hair any more . As vassals belonging to the castle of Hohentwiel , ye have knelt down , as freedmen , stand up again ; and may ye be as fond of each other in your free state , as before ! ”</p>
   <p>This was the form of granting freedom , according to the Salic law . The Emperor Lotharius , had already shaken the golden Denar , out of his old servant Doda 's hand ; thus freeing her from the yoke of slavery ; and as Audifax was of Franconian birth , Dame Hadwig had not acted according to the Allemannic laws .</p>
   <p>The two children arose . They had well understood what had happened . A strange dizzy feeling had seized the little goat-herd 's brain . The dream of his youth ,— liberty , golden treasure ,— all had become true ! a lasting reality , for all days to come !</p>
   <p>When the mist before his eyes , had cleared away again , he beheld Ekkehard 's serious countenance , and throwing himself at his feet with Hadumoth , he cried : “ Father Ekkehard , we thank you also , for having been good to us ! ”</p>
   <p>“ What a pity that it is already so late , ” said Praxedis , “ or you might have joined another pair in wedlock ; or at least have sanctified a solemn betrothal ; for these two , belong as much to each other , as yonder pair . ”</p>
   <p>Ekkehard let his blue eyes , rest for a while on the two children . Laying his hands on their heads and making the sign of the cross over them , he softly said to himself , “ where is happiness ? ” ——</p>
   <p>Late at night , Rudimann the cellarer rode back to his monastery . The ford being dry he could cross it on horseback . From the Abbot 's cell , a gleam of light still fell on the lake . So Rudimann knocked at his door , and but half opening it said : “ My ears have taken in more to-day , than they liked to hear . ‘ Tis all over with the Saspach estate on the Rhine . She is going to make that milksop of St. Gall steward of it . ” ...</p>
   <p>“ Varium et mutabile semper femina ! Woman is ever fickle and changeable ! ” murmured the Abbot , without looking round . “ Good night ! ”</p>

     <l n="1">Gunzo verso Ekkehard .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>During the time in which all that has been told until now , was happening on the shores of the Bodensee , far away in the Belgian lands , in the monastery of the holy Amandus sur l'Elnon , a monk had been sitting in his cell . Day after day , whenever the convent rules permitted it , he sat there transfixed as by a spell . The rough and cheerless winter time had come ; all the rivers were frozen up , and snow covered the plain as far as eye could see ,— he scarcely noticed it . Spring followed and drove away winter ,— he heeded it not . The brothers talked of war , and evil tidings , which had reached them from the neighbouring Rhine-lands ,— but he had no time to listen to these tales .</p>
   <p>In his cell , every article of furniture , nay even the floor was covered with parchments , for almost all the monastery 's books had emigrated to his chamber . There , he sat reading and thinking , and reading again , as if he wanted to find out the first cause of all being . On his right , lay the psalms and holy Scriptures ; on his left the remains of heathenish wisdom . Everything he peered over assiduously ; now and then , a malicious smile interrupting the seriousness of his studies , upon which he would hastily scribble down some lines , on a narrow strip of parchment . Were these , grains of gold and precious stones , which he dug out of the mines of ancient wisdom ? No .</p>
   <p>“ What on earth , can be the matter with brother Gunzo ? ” said his fellow-monks amongst themselves . “ In former times his tongue rattled on like a millwheel , and the books were seldom disturbed in their rest , by him ; for , did he not often say with boasting mien : ‘ They can only tell me , what I know already ? ’ — and now ? Why , now his pen hurries on , sputtering and scratching , so that you may bear the noise it makes , even in the cross-passage . Does he hope to become notary or prime minister of the Emperor ? Is he trying to find the philosopher 's stone , or is he perhaps writing down , his journey in Italy ? ”</p>
   <p>But brother Gunzo , continued his labours undisturbed , whatever they were . Untiringly he emptied his jug of water and read his classics . The first thunder-storms came , telling of summer 's heat ; but he let thunder and lightning do as they pleased , without minding them . His slumbers at night were sometimes broken by his rushing up to his inkstand , as if he had caught some good ideas in his dreams ; but often they had vanished before he had succeeded in writing them down . Still his perseverance in trying to attain his aim , never wavered , and consoling himself with the prophetic words of Homer : “ Yet though it tarry long , the day is certainly coming , ” he crept back to his couch .</p>
   <p>Gunzo was in the prime of life ; of moderate height and portly dimensions . When he stood before his well-polished metal mirror in the early morning , and gazed somewhat longer than was necessary , on his own image , he would often stroke his reddish beard with a threatening gesture , as if he were going out there and then , to fight in single combat .</p>
   <p>In his veins , flowed Franconian as well as Gallic blood , and this latter gave him something of the liveliness and sprightliness , which is wanting in all those of pure Teutonic race . For this reason , he had bitten and torn a good many more goose quills , whilst writing , than any monk in a German monastery would have done , besides holding many a soliloquy , in the same space of time . In spite of this he mastered the natural restlessness of his body , and forced his feet to keep quiet , under the heavily laden writing desk .</p>
   <p>On a soft , balmy summer evening , when his pen had again flitted over the patient parchment , like a will-o ’ - the-wisp , emitting a soft creaking sound , it suddenly began to slacken its pace ,— then made a pause ; a few strokes more , and then he executed a tremendous flourish on the remaining space below , so that the ink made an involuntary shower of spots , like black constellations . He had written the word finis , and with a deep sigh of relief he rose from his chair , like a man from whose mind , some great weight has been taken . Casting a long look on that which lay before him , black on white , he solemnly exclaimed , “ praised be the holy Amandus ! we are avenged ! ”</p>
   <p>At this great and elevating moment , he had finished a libel , dedicated to the venerable brotherhood on the Reichenau , and aimed at ,— Ekkehard the custodian at St. Gall . When the fair-haired interpreter of Virgil took leave of his monastery , and went to the Hohentwiel , he never , though he searched the remotest corners of his memory , had an inkling of the fact , that there was a man living , whose greatest wish and desire was to take vengeance on him ; for he was inoffensive and kindhearted , never willingly hurting a fly . And yet so it was , for between Heaven and Earth , and especially in the minds of learned men , many things will happen , which the reason of the reasonable , never dreams of .</p>
   <p>History has its caprices , both in preserving and destroying . The German songs and epics , which the great Emperor Charles had so carefully collected , were to perish in the dust and rubbish of the following ages ; whilst the work of Brother Gunzo , which never benefited any one of the few who read it , has come down to posterity . Let the monstrous deed , which so excited the Gallic scholar 's ire , therefore be told in his own words .</p>
   <p>“ For a long space of time ,— thus he wrote to his friends on the Reichenau ,— the revered and beloved King Otto , had carried on negotiations with the different Italian princes , to let me come over to his lands . But as I was neither of such low birth , or so dependent upon any , that I could have been forced to this step , he himself sent a petition to me , of which the consequence was , my pledging myself to obey his call . Thus it happened , that when he left Italy , I soon followed him , and when I did so , I did it with the hope , that my coming ,— whilst harming no one , might benefit many ; for what sacrifices does the love of one 's fellow-creatures , and the desire to please , not entice us into ? Thus I travelled onwards , not like a Briton , armed with the sharp weapons of censure , but in the service of love and science .</p>
   <p>“ Over high mountain-passes and steep ravines and valleys , I arrived at last at the monastery of St. Gall , in a state of such bodily exhaustion , that my hands , stiffened by the icy mountain air , refused me their service , so that I had to be taken down from my mule by stranger hands . The hope of the traveller , was to find a peaceful resting-place , within the monastic walls ; which hope was strengthened , on beholding the frequent bending of heads , the sober-coloured garments , soft-treading steps , and sparing use of speech , prevalent there . So I was wholly unprepared for what was to follow ; although by a strange chance , I happened to think of Juvenal 's saying with regard to the false philosophers .</p>
   <p>‘ Sparing and soft is their speech ,— but malice is lurking behind it ! ’</p>
   <p>and who would have believed that the said heathen was gifted with a prophetic vision of future cowl-bearing wickedness ?</p>
   <p>“ Yet I was still harmlessly enjoying my life , waiting to see , whether amongst the scanty murmurs of the brothers , some sparks of philosophical wisdom would shine forth . All remained dark however , for they were preparing the arms of cunning .</p>
   <p>“ Amongst their numbers , there was also a young convent-pupil and his uncle , who — well , who was no better than he should be ! They called him a worthy teacher of the school ; although to me he appeared rather to look at the world with the eyes of a turtle-dove . Of this languishing-looking wiseacre I shall have to say more , presently . Listen , and judge of his deed !</p>
   <p>“ Walking up and down , he instigated the convent-pupil to become a partaker of his base design .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Night had come , and with it the time for grief-stilling slumber :</l>
     <l n="2">After the sumptuous meal , Bacchus exacted his rights ’ ——</l>
   </lg>
   <p>when an evil star prompted my making a mistake in the use of a casus , in the Latin table speeches we held together ; using an accusativus , where I ought to have put an ablativus .</p>
   <p>“ Now it became evident , in what kind of arts , that far-famed teacher had instructed his pupil , all day long . ‘ Such an offence against the laws of grammar , deserved the rod , ’ mockingly said that little imp , to me the well-tried scholar ; and he further produced a rhymed libel , which his fine teacher must have prompted him to , and which caused a rough cisalpine burst of laughter in the refectory , at the expense of the stranger guest .</p>
   <p>“ But who does not know what the verses of a set of overbearing monks , must be like ? What do such as they know of the inner structure of a poem , where all must be artistically built up , to produce a fine and pleasing effect ? What of the high dignity of poetry ?— They pucker up their lips , and spout forth a poem , like to that Lucilius , who has been branded by Horace ; and who , whilst standing on one foot only , dictated two hundred verses and more , before an hour had elapsed .</p>
   <p>“ Judge now , ye venerable brothers , what insults have been heaped on me ; and what must be the character of the man , who can upbraid his fellow-creature for mistaking an ablativus ! ”</p>
   <p>The man , who intending only a harmless jest , had committed this fearful crime , was Ekkehard . But a few weeks before the sudden turn in his fate brought him to the Hohentwiel , the terrible deed had been done . With the coming morn on the next day , he had forgotten the conversation that had taken place at supper with the overbearing Italian , but in the bosom of him , who had been convicted of the wrong ablativus , was matured a rancour as fierce and gnawing as that , which , caused by the war-deeds of Achilles , drove the Telamonian Aias , to destroy himself , and which followed him even into the Hades .</p>
   <p>He rode towards the north out of the valley along through which the Sitter rushes ; he saw the Bodensee and the Rhine , and thought of the ablativus ! He entered the grey and ancient gates of Cologne , and crossed the frontiers of Belgium ,— but the false ablativus sat behind him on the saddle like an incubus . The cloister-walls of the holy Amandus could not exclude it ; and in the early psalms at morning , and during the litany and vespers , the accusativus , rose before his mind , exacting its expiatory sacrifice .</p>
   <p>Of all the unpleasant days of one 's life , those imprint themselves deepest in our minds , in which by our own fault , a humiliation has befallen us . Instead of being angry with one 's self , one easily bears an ill will towards all those , who were the involuntary witnesses of our defeat . The human heart is so very unwilling to confess its own failings ; and many a one who unmoved can think of past battles and dangers , feels his blood rush into his cheeks , at the recollection of some foolish word , which escaped him just then , when he would have liked so much to have made a brilliant remark .</p>
   <p>Therefore Gunzo was bent on taking his revenge on Ekkehard , and he had an able and sharp pen , and had spent many a month over his work , so that it became a master-piece of its kind . It was a black soup , made up of hundreds of learned quotations , richly seasoned with pepper and worm-wood , and all those spicy , bitter things , which before all others , give such a delicious flavour to the controversies of ecclesiastical men .</p>
   <p>Besides this , a delightful undercurrent of rudeness pervaded the whole ; so that the reader feels as though a man were being thrashed with regular flails , in a neighbouring barn . This makes a very pleasant contrast to our present times , in which the poison is presented in the shape of gilt pills ; and when the combatants first exchange a polite bow , before they break each others heads .</p>
   <p>The treatise was divided into two parts ; the first serving to prove , that only an ignorant and uncultivated mind could be shocked by so slight an error , as the mistaking of a casus ; whilst the second was written in order to convince the world that the author himself , was the wisest , most learned , and at the same time most pious of all his contemporaries .</p>
   <p>For this end he had read the classics and the holy Scriptures , in the sweat of his brow , so that he could make a list of all the places in which the caprice , or negligence of the author , had also misplaced an ablativus . So he managed to name two in Virgil , one in Homer , Terence and Priscianus . Further an example out of Persius , where the ablative stands in the place of the genitive , besides a number of instances out of the books of Moses , and the Psalms .</p>
   <p>And if a number of such instances , can be found even in the holy Scriptures , who is so wicked , that he would dare to blame or change , such a mode of expression ? Wrongly , therefore believes the little monk of St. Gall , that I was not well versed in the grammar ; although my tongue may sometimes be impeded , by the habits of my own language , which , though derived from the Latin , is yet very different from it . Now , blunders are made , through carelessness , and human imperfection in general ; for , says Priscianus very truly : “ I do not believe , that of all human inventions , a single one , can be perfect in all respects , and on all sides . In like manner , Horace has often taken it on himself , to excuse negligences of style and language , in eminent men : ‘ sometimes even the good Homer is slumbering , ’ and Aristotle says in his book on the hermeneia : ‘ All that , which our tongue utters , is merely an outward expression of that which is stamped on our mind . The idea of a thing , therefore is always pre-existent before the expression , and therefore the thing itself is of far greater importance , than the mere word . But whenever the meaning is abstruse , thou shalt patiently , and with thy reasoning powers , try to find out the real import . ’ ”</p>
   <p>Then there followed innumerable classical examples of awkward and negligent expressions of thought , which ended with the words of the Apostle , who calls himself , “ unskilled , with regard to speech , but not unskilled in knowledge . ”</p>
   <p>“ If one therefore examines the behaviour of my antagonist of St. Gall , one feels tempted to believe , that he had once invaded the garden of some wise man ; from one of whose hot-beds he had stolen a radish , which had discomposed his stomach and increased his gall . Let everybody therefore keep a sharp look-out on his garden . Evil communications , corrupt good manners .</p>
   <p>“ Yet it is possible also , that he could not have done otherwise ; for having perchance rummaged the whole day long , in the remotest folds of his cowl , to find something wherewith to regale the stranger guest , and not finding anything else , but cunning and malice , he let his guest taste a bit of that . Bad men have evil possessions .</p>
   <p>“ With his behaviour , his outward appearance ,— which we did not fail carefully to investigate ,— was in strict harmony . His countenance bore a pale lustre , like bad metal , used for the adulteration of the genuine ; his hair was crimped ; his hood finer and daintier than necessary , and his shoes of light make ,— so that all the signs of vanity were found on him , which were a vexation in the eyes of St. Hieronymus , when he wrote : ‘ To my great regret , there are some of the clergy in my parish , who are very anxious for their garments to be well scented and their nails well polished ; who anoint their curled hair with precious ointments , and who wear dainty , embroidered shoes . Such garments , however , are scarcely fitted for a dandy and bridegroom , let alone for one of the Lord 's elected . ’</p>
   <p>“ Further I have reflected , whether the sound of his own name , was not in harmony with his actions likewise . And what now ? Ekkhard , or Akhar , was his name ,— as if already at his baptism , by dint of a prophetic providence , he had been stigmatized with the name of a malefactor ; for who does not know of that Akhar who appropriated to himself a purple mantle , as well as two hundred bags of silver , and a golden wedge , out of the booty at Jericho , so that Joshuah , had him led out into a remote valley , where he was stoned to death , by all Israel ; and all he possessed was given up to the flames ?— Of such a man his namesake of St. Gall , has shown himself to be a worthy successor ; for he who disregards the laws of politeness and good breeding , acts as badly as a thief . He purloins the gold of true wisdom .</p>
   <p>“ If it were permitted to believe in the transmigration of souls , such as Pythagoras has taught , it would be beyond all doubt , that the soul of the Hebrew Akhar , had entered the frame of this Ekkehard , and in this case one ought to pity it , as it were better to dwell in the body of a fox even , than in that of a crafty and cunning monk . All this which I have said until now , has been said without any personal hatred . My hatred is directed only against the man 's inherent wickedness . Consequently I only detest an attribute of his and not the substance itself , which we are bound to honour , as God 's likeness , according to Scripture .</p>
   <p>“ Please to observe now , ” continued Gunzo in the second part of his book , “ how insanely my enemy has acted against the benefits of science and knowledge . More than a hundred written volumes , had I brought with me , over the Alps ; weapons of peace , such as Marcianus ’ flowery instructions in the seven liberal arts ; Plato 's unfathomable depth in his Timaeus ; the obscure wisdom of Aristotle , hardly lighted up in our present days , in his book on the hermeneia , and Cicero 's eloquence in the Topica .</p>
   <p>“ How serious and faithful might our conversation not have been , if they had questioned me , about these treasures ! How could I imagine that such as I , whom God has so richly gifted , would be ridiculed on account of mistaking a casus ! I who know Donat and Priscianus almost by heart !</p>
   <p>“ It is probable that that empty coxcomb believes , that he carries the whole of the Grammatica , in his hood ,— but beloved brethren , believe me — he has scarcely had a glimpse of her back in the distance , and if he were to try , to catch sight of her radiant countenance , he would stumble , and fall to the ground , over his own awkward feet . The Grammatica is a noble woman , who wears for a woodcutter an aspect very different from that she has for an Aristotle .</p>
   <p>“ But how shall I speak to you of grammar 's sister , of dialectics , whom that Greek sage has called , the nurse of intellect ? Oh noble art ! that entangles the fool in her nets , whilst showing the wise man how to evade them , and discloses to our wondering eyes , the hidden threads , by which being and not-being are linked together ! But of that , yon cowl-bearing monk knows nothing ! Nothing of that subtle fineness , which with nineteen kinds of syllogisms , knows how to explain all that , which has ever been thought before , as well as all that which can be thought hereafter . God is wise , and deprives him of such knowledge ; knowing beforehand that he would only use it for deceitful and wicked ends ... ”</p>
   <p>In this way the learned Italian proved his superiority in all the liberal arts . To rhetoric and all its treasures , a whole chapter was dedicated , in which certain persons , to whom the Goddess Minerva had once appeared in their dreams ; and fools who believed that brevity of expression is a proof of wisdom , were pointedly alluded to . Then arithmetic , geometry and astronomy were discussed ; interspersed with deep investigations , on the questions , whether the stars were gifted with intellectual souls , and a claim on immortality ; and further whether at the time when Joshuah had said : “ Sun stand thou still upon Gibeon ; and thou moon in the valley of Ajalon , ” he had also imposed immobility on the other five planets ; or whether these had been allowed to continue their circular motion .</p>
   <p>A profound sounding of this problem , offered an opportunity of speaking first of the harmony of the spheres , and then of music in general , as the last of the liberal arts ; and thus the vengeance-fraught little ship , carried along by the billowy floods of learning , could at last reach the goal , it had so long been aiming at .</p>
   <p>“ Wherefore now do you think , that I have expounded all this ? ” asked he finally .</p>
   <p>“ Not to expound the elements of the liberal arts , but to expose the folly of an ignorant man , who preferred pecking away at grammatical blunders , to deriving true wisdom , from his guest ; for though his inward nature may for ever be shut out from the realms of art , he might at least have caught an outward reflection of my light . But he was swelling with insolent pride , so that he preferred to pass for a sage amongst his fellow-monks ; like to that frog which sitting in the mire , thought to rival the bull in greatness . Ah , never has the pitiful creature , stood on the heights of science , hearing God 's own voice speak to him . Born in the wilderness and grown up amidst silly , prattling people , his soul has remained on the level of the beasts of the field . Unwilling to dwell in the active life of this world , and incapable of a life of inward contemplation , he has been marked by the enemy of mankind , as his own . Willingly I would exhort you to try what could be done for him , with the aid of healing medicine , but I sadly fear that his disease is too deeply rooted .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ For on a hardened skin , even sneeze-wort will prove , unavailing , ’ says Persius .</p>
   <p>“ And now , after having read all this , please to judge ye venerable brothers , whether I am the man to have merited such treatment and ridicule , from the hands of a fool . I deliver both him and myself into your hands , for before the judgment of the just , the fool falls back into his own nothingness . Finis ! ”</p>
   <p>“ ... Praised be the holy Amandus ! ” said Gunzo once more , when the last word of his work had been written down . The old serpent would certainly have swelled with joy , if it could have watched him , in the full glory of his likeness to deity , when he added the last dot . ‘ And God looked on all that he had made , and behold , it was good . ’ And Gunzo ?— He did the same .</p>
   <p>Then he walked up to his metal looking-glass , and gazing for a long time at his own reflection , as if it were of the greatest importance for him , to study the countenance of the man who had annihilated the Ekkehard of St. Gall , he finally made a deep bow to himself .</p>
   <p>The bell in the refectory had for some time been announcing the supper-hour . Psalm and grace were finished , and the brotherhood was already seated before the steaming millet-porridge , when Gunzo at last came in with a radiant countenance . The dean , silently pointed to a remote corner away from his customary seat ; for he , who missed the regular hour too often , was , as a punishment , separated from the others , and his wine was given to the poor . But without the least murmur , Gunzo sat down , and drank his Belgian pump-water ,— for his book was lying finished in his cell , and that made up to him for everything .</p>
   <p>When the meal was over , he invited some of his friends to come up to his cell , in as mysterious a way , as if they were about to dig for some hidden treasure , and when they were all assembled , he read his work out to them . The monastery of St. Gallus , with its libraries , schools and learned teachers , was far too famous in all Christendom for the disciples of St. Amandus not to listen to the whizzing of Gunzo 's arrows , with a secret joy . Cleverness and a blameless life , are often far more offensive to the world , than sin and wickedness . Therefore they nodded their hoary heads approvingly , as Gunzo read out the choice bits .</p>
   <p>“ It would have been well before this , to have taught these Helvetian bears a lesson ! ” said one . “ Insolence joined to roughness does not deserve any gentler treatment . ”</p>
   <p>Gunzo continued . “ Bene , optime , aristotelicissime ! ” murmured the assembled monks , when he had ended .</p>
   <p>“ May the dish please you , Brother Akhar ! ” exclaimed another . “ Belgian spice , to flavour the Helvetian cheese ! ”</p>
   <p>The brother head-cook , embracing Gunzo , actually wept with joy . Nothing so learned , profound and beautiful , had ever gone out into the world before , from the cloister of St. Amandus . Only one of the brothers was standing immovable near the wall .</p>
   <p>“ Well ? ” said Gunzo interrogatively .</p>
   <p>“ And where is charity ? ” softly asked the brother , and after these few words he relapsed again into silence The reproach struck home .</p>
   <p>“ Thou art right , Hucbald , ” said he . “ This want shall be supplied . Charity requires us to pray for our enemies . Therefore I will add a prayer for the poor fool , at the end . That will have a good appearance , and impress all tender minds favourably . Ay ? ”</p>
   <p>But the brother did not reply . It had become very late , and they all left the cell now on tip-toe . Gunzo tried to retain him who had spoken of charity , as he cared a good deal for his opinion ; but Hucbald turned away and followed the others .</p>
   <p>“ Matthew twenty-three , verse twenty-five , ” he murmured when his foot had crossed the threshold . Nobody heard it .</p>
   <p>Slumber that night , however , obstinately refused to close the eyes of Gunzo the learned . So he read the production of his industry over and over again . He soon knew in what place every word stood , and yet he could not withdraw his eyes from the well-known lines . At last he seized his pen , saying : “ A more pious ending ,— so be it ! ” He reflected a while , pacing up and down his cell with slow measured steps . “ It shall be done in hexametres , for who has ever before , retaliated an insult received , in so worthy a manner ? ”</p>
   <p>So he sat down and wrote . He wished to write a prayer for his enemy ,— but then nobody can act contrary to his nature . Once more he glanced over the written pages . They were really too good ! Then he penned the supplement . When the cock was announcing the dawn of day , this also was finished . Two dozen and a half of rattling monks ’ verses . That his thoughts , from the prayer for his antagonist , by degrees , diverged on himself and his glorious work , was but a natural transition for a man gifted with so much self-esteem .</p>
   <p>With complacent unction , he wrote down the five last stanzas .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Go then into the world , my book ; and wherever , thou findest ,</l>
     <l n="2">Shameful , slanderous tongues , which my glorious life are defiling ,</l>
     <l n="3">Crush them without remorse , and humble them with thy just censure ,</l>
     <l n="4">Until thy author one day , will enter the kingdom of Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="5">Such as is promised to him , who has not buried his talents . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">The parchment was rough , and resistant , so that he had to press the</l>
     <l n="7">goose-quill , in order to make it receive the letters .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>On the next day , Gunzo packed up his epistle in a tin box , and this again in a linen bag . A bondsman of the monastery , who had slain his brother , had taken a vow of a pilgrimage to the grave of the twelve Saints , with his right arm chained to his right hip ; and to pray there until some heavenly sign of grace , was shown to him . His way led up the Rhine . So , Gunzo put the tin case round his neck , and a few weeks later , it was delivered safe and sound into the hands of the gate-keeper at Reichenau . Gunzo well knew his friends there . Therefore he had dedicated the libel to them .</p>
   <p>Moengal the old parish-priest had also some business to transact in the monastery , on that day . In the stranger 's room sat the Belgian pilgrim . They had given him some fish-soup , which he managed to eat with much difficulty ; his chains clinking whenever he lifted his arm .</p>
   <p>“ Thou hadst better go home again , and marry the widow of the man thou hast slain , ” said Moengal . “ That would be a far better expiation , than to make a fool 's journey into the wide world , with your rattling chains . ”</p>
   <p>The pilgrim shook his head silently , as if he thought that such chains might prove heavier still , than any which the blacksmith could forge .</p>
   <p>Moengal asked to be announced to the Abbot . “ He is very busy with some book he is reading , ” was the answer . Nevertheless he was ushered into his presence .</p>
   <p>“ Sit down , parish-priest , ” graciously said the Abbot . “ I know that you are rather fond of salty and peppery things . Here 's something for you . ”</p>
   <p>He read out to him Gunzo 's libel which had just arrived . The old man listened attentively , but his eyebrows contracted and his nostrils expanded during the lecture .</p>
   <p>When he had come to the description of Ekkehard 's curly hair and fine shoes , the Abbot was nearly convulsed with laughter , but Moengal sat there , rigid and serious , and on his forehead a frown had gathered , like clouds before a thunderstorm .</p>
   <p>“ Well I reckon , that his pride will be well whipped out of him ! ” said the Abbot . “ Sublime ! really sublime ! And an abundance of knowledge . That will strike home , and cannot be answered . ”</p>
   <p>“ But it can though , ” grimly said the parish-priest .</p>
   <p>“ And in what way ? ” eagerly asked the Abbot .</p>
   <p>Moengal made a gesture of evil import . “ A good stick from a holly-bush , or a brave hazel-wand , is all that 's wanted , and then to go down the Rhine , until there is but an arm 's length left between the Suabian wood and the Italian writer 's back . And then . ” ... He concluded his speech figuratively .</p>
   <p>“ You are somewhat rude , parish-priest , and have no appreciation of learning , ” said the Abbot . “ To be sure — such a treatise as that can only be written by a refined intellect . Respect , I say ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Fine learning that , indeed ! ” exclaimed Moengal , who had worked himself into a downright rage . “ ‘ Puffed-up lips , and a bad and wicked heart , are like an earthen pot , covered with tinsel , ’ says Solomon . Learned ? Why , the wood in my parish is as learned as that , for it also repeats , what you call out to it , and that is at least a melodious echo . We know these Belgian peacocks , which are to be found though , also in other parts . Their feathers are stolen , and their singing , in spite of tail and rainbow-colours behind , is hoarse , and will always be hoarse ; no matter what airs the creatures may give themselves . Before my great recovery , I also believed that it was singing , instead of croaking , when a fellow puffed up his cheeks with grammar and dialectics , but now : ‘ Farewell , Marcianus Capella , ’ say we now at Radolfszell ! ”</p>
   <p>“ I believe that it is time for you to think of going home , as the clouds are fast gathering over Constance , ” said the Abbot .</p>
   <p>Then the parish-priest found out , that he had not chosen a suitable individual , for expounding his views on healthy opinions and science to . So he took leave .</p>
   <p>“ For the matter of that , thou mightst have remained as well in thy monastery at Benchor on the emerald isle , thou Irish wooden-head , ” thought Abbot Wazmann , whilst taking leave with evident coolness .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Rudimann ! ” he called out through the passage , when Moengal was gone .</l>
     <l n="2">Rudimann , instantly made his appearance .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ I suppose you remember the last vintage-time , ” began the Abbot , “ as well as a blow given to you by a certain milk-sop , to whom a fanciful Duchess , is now about to give certain lands ? ”</p>
   <p>“ I remember the blow , ” replied Rudimann with a bashful smile , like a maiden who is questioned about her lover .</p>
   <p>“ That blow has been returned by someone , with a strong and unrelenting hand . You may be satisfied . Read this , ” handing Gunzo 's parchment to him .</p>
   <p>“ By your leave , ” said Rudimann , stepping up to the window . He had tasted many a noble wine in his life , during the time that he had occupied his present post of cellarer , but even on the day , when the bishop of Cremona had sent him some jugs of sparkling brown Asti , his countenance had not shone so radiantly , as it did now .</p>
   <p>“ What a precious gift from above , is extensive knowledge , and a fine style , ” exclaimed he . “ The brother Ekkehard is done for . He cannot dare to show his face again . ”</p>
   <p>“ Tis not quite so far yet , ” said the Abbot . “ But then , that which is not , may yet be in the future . The learned brother Gunzo is helping us . His epistle must not be allowed to rot unread . So you can have some copies taken ; better six than three . That fine young gentleman must be driven away from the Hohentwiel . I am not overfond of yellow-beaked birds , who pretend to sing better than their elders . Some cold water , poured on his tonsure , will benefit him . We will send a note to our brother in St. Gall , urging him to command his return . How is it with the list of his sins ? ”</p>
   <p>Rudimann slowly raised his left hand , and began to count on his fingers . “ Shall I recount them ? First he has disturbed the peace of our monastery , during the vintage , by , ... ”</p>
   <p>“ Stop , ” said the Abbot , “ that is past and done away with . All that , which happened before the battle with the Huns , is buried and forgotten . That is a law which the Burgundians made , and which we will adhere to , also . ”</p>
   <p>“ Then without the help of my fingers , ” said the cellarer . “ The custodian of St. Gallus has become subject to haughtiness and insolence , since the day on which he left his monastery . Without moving his lips to frame a greeting , he passes by , brothers , whose age and intellect , ought to claim his reverence . Then , he presumed to preach the sermon , on the holy day when we beat the Huns ; although such an important and solemn office , ought to have been performed by one of the Abbots . Further , he presumed to baptize a heathenish prisoner ; although such a baptism should have been superintended by the regular priest of the parish and not by one , who ought to attend at the gate of the monastery of St. Gallus .</p>
   <p>“ What may still arise out of the constant intercourse of the forward youth with his noble mistress , He Who searcheth all hearts , alone can tell ! Already at the wedding-feast of that baptized heathen , it was observed that he did not shun meetings with that beauteous dame , in solitary places ; and that he heaved frequent sighs , like a shot buck . Likewise it has been remarked with heartfelt sorrow , that a Greek maiden , as fickle and unstable as a will-o ’ - the-wisp , is flickering about him ; so that , that which is left undone by the mistress , may be finished by her hand-maiden , of whose orthodoxy even , one is not fully assured . Now , a frivolous woman is bitterer than death , according to Scripture . She is a bait of the evil one , and her heart is a net , and only he who pleases God , can escape her wiles . ”</p>
   <p>It was a most becoming and just thing , for Rudimann , the protector of the uppermaid Kerhildis , to be so well versed , in the words of the Preacher .</p>
   <p>“ Enough , ” said the Abbot . “ Chapter twenty-nine , treating of the calling back of absent brothers . It will do , and I have a sort of presentiment , that the fickle lady will soon flutter about on her rock , like an old swallow , whose nestling has been taken away . Goodbye sweetheart !... and Saspach will yet become ours ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Amen ! ” murmured Rudimann .</p>

    <head>CHAPTER XVIII .</head>
     <l n="1">Master Spazzo the Chamberlain 's Mission .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Early on a cool pleasant summer day , Ekkehard walked out of the castle gate , into the breezy morning air . He had passed a sleepless night , during which he had paced up and down in his chamber . The Duchess had called up a host of wild thoughts in his heart , and in his head there was a buzzing and humming , as if a covey of wild ducks were flying about there . He shunned Dame Hadwig 's presence , and yet longed every moment that he was away , to be near her . The old happy ingenuousness had taken wing . His ways had become absent and variable ; in short , the time which has never been spared yet to mortal man , and which Godfrey of Strassburg describes : “ as an everpresent pain , in a continual state of bliss , ” had come for him .</p>
   <p>Before the night had quite set in , a thunderstorm was raging outside . He had opened his little window , and enjoyed the fierce sheets of lightning , flashing through the gathering darkness , and every now and then , lighting up the shores of the lake ; and he had laughed when night had triumphed again , and the thunders were reverberating between the hills .</p>
   <p>Now it was a fine sunny morning . Glistening dew-drops hung on the grass , and here and there , an unmelted hailstone , was lying in the shade . Quiet and peace were now reigning over hill and vale , but the ears of the blasted cornfields , hung down their broken heads , for the hail-storm had blighted the fair promising harvest . From the rocky hillsides , mud-coloured little brooklets , were running down into the valley .</p>
   <p>As yet , nothing was stirring in the fields , for it was only just daybreak . In the distance , on the hilly ground which extends in undulating lines at the back of the Hohentwiel , a man was striding along . It was the Hunnic convert . He carried willow branches and all sorts of slings , and was just setting out on his work to wage war on the field-mice . As he walked along , he whistled merrily on a lime-tree leaf , and looked the image of a happy bridegroom ; for in the arms of the tall Friderun , he had found new happiness .</p>
   <p>“ How are you ? ” mildly said Ekkehard when he passed by with an humble salutation . The Hun pointed up to the blue sky : “ as if I were in heaven ! ” said he , gaily spinning round on one of his wooden shoes . Ekkehard turned his steps back again ; but for a long while the whistling of the mouse-catcher , could still be heard interrupting the silence around . At the foot of the hill there lay a piece of weatherbeaten rock , over which an elder-tree spread its boughs , richly laden with luxuriant white blossoms . Ekkehard sat down on it , and after dreamily gazing into the distance for some time , he drew out from under his habit , a neatly bound little book , and began to read . It was neither a breviary nor the Psalter . It was called , “ The song of Solomon , ” and it was not good for him to read it . To be sure , they had once taught him , that the lily-scented song , expressed the longing for the church , the true bride of the soul , and in his younger days he had studied it , undisturbed by the gazelle eyes , and the dovelike cheeks and slender as the palm-tree waist of the Sulamite woman , but now !— now he read it with other eyes . A soft dreaminess came over him .</p>
   <p>“ Who is it , that looketh forth as the morning , fair as the moon , clear as the sun , and terrible as an army with banners ? ” He looked up to the towers of the Hohentwiel , which were glittering in the first rays of the morning sun , and there found the answer .</p>
   <p>And again he read : “ I sleep but my heart waketh : it is the voice of my beloved , that knocketh saying : open to me my sister , my love , my dove , for my head is filled with dew , and my locks with the drops of night . ” — A stirring breeze shook down some of the white blossoms on the little book . Ekkehard did not shake them off . He had bent down his head , and was sitting there immovable .</p>
   <p>Meanwhile , Cappan had cheerfully begun his daily labours . There was a field down in the plain , on the border of the lands belonging to the Hohentwiel , on which the field-mice had erected their headquarters . The hamsters were carrying off plenty of provisions for the winter , and the moles were digging their passages in the gravelly soil . To that spot , Cappan had received orders to betake himself . Like a statesman in a rebellious province , he was to restore order , and cleanse the land of all obnoxious subjects . The floods of the late thunderstorm , had laid open the hidden refuges . He dug them up gently , and slew many a field-mouse before it was aware of it . Then , he carefully prepared his various slings and traps , putting also here and there some poisonous baits , which he had concocted out of the thorn-apple and belladonna ; and all the while that he was thus intent on these his murderous designs , he continued to whistle merrily ; little knowing what terrible clouds were gathering over his head .</p>
   <p>The land on which he was exercising his art , bordered on some grounds , that belonged to the monastery of Reichenau . There , where a forest of stately old oaks stretched their tops into the air , some straw-thatched roofs might be seen . These were the roofs of the Schlangenhof , which , together with many acres of wood and fields , belonged to the monastery . A pious widow had left it to St. Pirmin , in order to secure eternal bliss for her soul . They had let it to a farmer , who was rather a rough man with a thick knotty skull , full of hard , stubborn thoughts . He had many men and maid-servants , as well as horses and cattle , and was altogether a thriving man , for he took good care that the copper-brown snakes , which infested both court and stable , were left unmolested . Their dish of milk in the stable-corner , was never allowed to remain empty , and in consequence they had got quite tame , and never harmed anybody . “ These snakes are the blessing of the whole farm , ” the old man would often repeat .</p>
   <p>For the last two days , however , the convent-farmer had not enjoyed one single quiet hour ; for the frequent thunderstorms made him very anxious about his crops . When three of them had passed by , without doing any damage , he had a horse put to a cart , on which was placed a sack of last year 's rye , and with that he drove over to the deacon of Singen . He , on seeing the cart approaching , grinned so as to show his big grinders , for he knew his customer well enough . His living was scanty , but out of the folly of mankind , he yet made enough to butter his bread with .</p>
   <p>The convent-farmer had taken the sack of corn down from the cart , and said : “ Master Otfried , you have taken good care of me , and have prayed away the thunderstorms from my fields . Do n't forget me , if the thunder should come on again . ”</p>
   <p>And the deacon replied : “ I think you must have seen me standing under the church-door , with my face turned towards the Schlangenhof , sprinkling the holy water three times towards the tempest , in the shape of the holy cross ; besides saying the verse of the three holy nails . That , drove away clouds and hailstones fast enough , I can tell you ! Your rye , convent-farmer , would make excellent bread , if a trifle of barley were added to it . ”</p>
   <p>Then , the convent-farmer returned home , and was just thinking of filling a smaller sack with barley , as an additional , well-deserved present , for his advocate with Heaven , when again some black and threatening clouds became visible . When they were looming dark and terrible , over the oak-wood , a whitish-grey smaller cloud hurried up after them . It had five points like to the fingers of a hand , and swelled and shot forth sheets of lightning , and soon a hail-storm , far worse than any previous ones , came down . The convent-farmer had at first stood confidently under his porch , thinking that the deacon of Singen would again drive it away , but when the hailstones began pelting his cornfields , causing the ears to fall like soldiers in a battle , he struck his clenched fist on the oaken table , calling out : “ may that cursed liar at Singen be damned . ”</p>
   <p>In the height of despair , at the deacon 's prayers having failed , he now tried an old traditional remedy of the Hegau . Tearing down some branches from the nearest oak-tree , he plucked off the leaves , and putting these into his venerable old wedding-coat , he hung that up , on the mighty oak-tree which overspread his house . But the merciless hailstones continued to beat down the corn , in spite of wedding-coat and oak-leaves . Like a statue , the convent-farmer stood there , with his eyes riveted on the bundle in the air , hoping that the wind which would drive the thunderstorm away , would come out of it ,— but it came not ! Then , biting his lips and with contracted eye-brows , he walked back into the house . Almost heart-broken with grief , he threw himself into a chair before the table , and for some time he sat there without uttering a word . When at last he spoke , it was to pronounce an awful curse . This , with the convent-farmer was already a change for the better .</p>
   <p>The head-servant , timidly ventured to approach him now . He was of gigantic stature , but before his master , he stood as timid as a child .</p>
   <p>“ If I only knew the witch ! ” exclaimed the farmer . “ The weather-witch ! the cursed old hag ! She should not have shaken out her skirts over the Schlangenhof in vain .... May her tongue be withered in her mouth ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Need it have been a witch ? ” said the head-servant . “ Since the woman of the wood has been driven away from the Hohenkraehen , no other has dared to show her face here . ”</p>
   <p>“ Hold thy tongue , until thou art asked ! ” fiercely growled the convent-farmer .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The man remained standing there , well knowing that his turn would come .</l>
     <l n="2">After some time the old man gruffly said : “ What dost thou know ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ I know , what I know , ” replied the other , with a sly expression .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">Again there ensued a pause . The convent-farmer looked out of the</l>
     <l n="5">window . The harvest was destroyed . He turned round .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="6">“ Speak , ” cried he .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Did you notice that strange grey cloud , sailing past the dark ones ? ” said the man . “ What else can it have been , but the cloud-ship ? Somebody has sold our corn to the owners of that ship . ” ...</p>
   <p>The convent-farmer crossed himself , as if he wanted to prevent his saying more .</p>
   <p>“ I have heard it said by my grandmother , ” continued the head-servant . “ She has often heard people speak about it in Alsace , when the thunderstorms came from over the Odilienberg . The ship comes from a land that is called Magonia , and is always white , and sails on black clouds . Fasolt and Mermuth sit in it , and throw down the hailstones on the fields , if the great weather-wizard has given them the power to do so . Then , they lift up our corn into their ship , and sail back to Magonia , where they are well paid for it . To be on good terms with the cloud-sailors , is more profitable than the reading of masses . We shall have nothing but the husks this year . ”</p>
   <p>The convent-farmer became thoughtful . Then he suddenly seized the head-servant by the collar , and shaking him violently , cried : “ who ? ” But the man in reply put one of his fingers up to his lips . It had become late .</p>
   <p>At the same early hour when Cappan had met Ekkehard , the convent-farmer , accompanied by the head-servant , was walking through the fields , to look at the damage . Neither of them said a word . The loss in crops was considerable , but they did not fail to observe that the land on the other side had suffered far less . It was as if the oak-wood had been the boundary line , for the hail-storm .</p>
   <p>On the neighbouring lands , Cappan was performing his duties . He had finished setting his traps , and thought he would allow himself some rest . So , he drew from his pocket a piece of bread and some bacon , which was as soft and white as the newly fallen snow , and looked so tempting that he could not help thinking of his spouse with deep gratitude , for having provided him with such food . Further , he thought about many another thing which had occurred since their wedding , and he cast a longing look up to the larks , as if he wanted them to fly over to the Hohenstoffeln , to carry some tender messages there , and again he felt so lightsome and happy , that he cut a mighty caper into the air .</p>
   <p>His slender spouse not being present just then , he thought of giving himself a treat , by lying down full length on the ground , whilst he ate his food ; for at home , he had until then always been obliged to sit down , little as he liked it .</p>
   <p>Just at that moment he remembered that Friderun , to call down a blessing on his work , had taught him to pronounce some words , which were to exorcise the vermin ; exhorting him very earnestly not to forget saying them . His breakfast would never have tasted well if he had not obeyed this injunction .</p>
   <p>On the border of the field , there was a stone , on which a half moon was engraven , the sign of Dame Hadwig 's ownership . He stepped up to it , and pulling off his wooden shoe from his right foot , he stood barefoot and stretched out his arms towards the wood . The convent-farmer and his head-servant , who were walking between the trees , stopped at this sight , but Cappan did not observe them and pronounced the words which Friderun had taught him .</p>
   <p>“ Aius sanctus , cardia cardiani ! Mouse and she-mouse , hamster and mole , I bid ye all to go away from the fields and meads below ; and may fever , plague and death follow you where'er ye go ! Afrias , aestrias , palamiasit ! ”</p>
   <p>Hidden behind some bulky oak-trees , the convent-farmer and his companion , had watched the exorcism . They now approached stealthily . “ Afrias , aestrias , palamiasit ! ” said Cappan for the second time , when a blow from behind , hit him right on the neck , so that he fell down . Strange , unintelligible words entered his ears , and before he had recovered from his surprise , four fists were lustily belabouring his back , like flails on a barn-floor .</p>
   <p>“ Out with it , thou corn-murderer ! ” shrieked the convent-farmer . “ What has the Schlangenhof ever done thee , thou weather-maker , mice-catcher , rake-hell ?! ”</p>
   <p>Cappan gave no answer . The poor fellow was perfectly bewildered , but this only angered the old man the more .</p>
   <p>“ Look into his eyes , whether they are bleared , and if things are reflected wrongly in them , ” called he out to the head-servant . The latter obeyed , but he was honest .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Tis not in the eyes , ” said he .</p>
   <p>“ Then lift up his arm ! ”</p>
   <p>He tore off the upper garment from the prostrate man , and examined his arms very carefully ; for he who held communion with evil spirits , bore some mark on his body . But they found nothing whatever on the poor wretch , except some scars of old wounds . This fact had almost restored him to favour in their eyes , for folks were then quick and changeable in their passions , as an historian of those days informs us . Just at that moment however , the servant-man 's eyes fell on the ground , where a large stag-beetle was crawling along . His wings shone with violet-blackish hue , and the reddish horns were proudly raised , like a stag 's antlers . He had witnessed the ill-treatment which Cappan had received , and was going to continue his way , not having liked it .</p>
   <p>The head-servant started back , affrightedly .</p>
   <p>“ The donnerguggi , ” exclaimed he .</p>
   <p>“ The thunder-beetle ! ” cried the convent-farmer likewise , and now Cappan was lost . That he , together with the beetle , had made the storm , was now beyond all doubt , for the stag-beetle , was then believed to attract thunder and lightning .</p>
   <p>“ Confess and repent , thou heathenish dog ! ” said the farmer , searching for his knife , but here an idea struck him and he continued , “ he shall meet with his punishment on the grave of his brothers . To revenge them , he has brought down the hail-storm . ”</p>
   <p>The servant had meanwhile smashed the stag-beetle between two large pebbles , which he afterwards buried in the ground . Together , they now laid hands on Cappan , dragging him over the field , to the Hunnic mound , and there bound fast his hands and feet . This being done , the man ran over to the Schlangenhof , to call his fellow-servants . Wild and blood-thirsty they came . Some of them had danced at Cappan 's wedding , but this did not in the least prevent their going out now to stone him .</p>
   <p>Cappan began to collect his scattered senses . What he was accused of , he could not guess , but he understood well enough , that his life was in great danger . Therefore he now uttered a shriek which rent the air , wild and complaining , like the death-cry of a wounded horse , and awakened Ekkehard from his reverie , under the elder-tree . He recognized the voice of his god-child and looked down . A second time , Cappan 's cry rose up to him , and then Ekkehard forgot Solomon 's song , and hurried down the valley . He came in the nick of time . They had placed Cappan , with his back towards the piece of rock covering the mound , and were forming a semi-circle around him . The convent-farmer explained how he had caught him in the very act of weather-making , and then they unanimously agreed , that he should be stoned to death .</p>
   <p>Into this grim assembly , rushed Ekkehard . The ecclesiastical men of those days were less deluded than they were a few hundred years later , when thousands lost their lives by fire , on account of similar accusations ; and the state signed the death-warrant ; and the church gave its blessing thereto . Ekkehard , though convinced of the existence of witchcraft , had himself once copied the treatise of the pious Bishop Agobard , written to disprove the nonsensical popular superstition of weather-making . Indignant wrath gave eloquence to his speech .</p>
   <p>“ What are ye about , ye deluded men , that ye intend to judge , when ye ought to pray that ye may not be judged yourselves ! If the man has sinned , then wait till the new moon , when the parish-priest at Radolfszell will be holding court against all malefactors . There , let seven sworn men , accuse him of the forbidden art , according to the laws of the emperor and of the church . ”</p>
   <p>But the men of the Schlangenhof would not heed his words . A threatening murmur ran through their ranks .</p>
   <p>Then , Ekkehard thought of striking another chord in their rough minds .</p>
   <p>“ And do ye really believe , ye sons of the land of saints , of the Suabian ground , which the Lord has been pleased to look upon with gracious eyes , that such a poor , miserable Hun could have the power , to command the clouds ? Do ye think that the clouds would obey him ? That a brave Hegau flash of lightning would not rather have split his head , to punish him , for having dared to meddle with it ? ”</p>
   <p>This last reason had almost convinced the native pride of the men , but the convent-farmer cried out : “ The thunder-beetle ! the thunder-beetle , we have seen it with our eyes , crawling around his feet ! ”</p>
   <p>Then the cry of “ stone him to death ! ” was again raised . A first stone was hurled at the unfortunate Hun , making his blood flow . Upon this , Ekkehard , bravely threw himself on his god-son , shielding him with his own body .</p>
   <p>This had its effect .</p>
   <p>The men of the Schlangenhof looked at each other dumfounded , until one of them turned round to go away , and the others following his example , the convent-farmer was soon left standing there all alone .</p>
   <p>“ You are taking the part of the land-destroyer ! ” he cried angrily , but on Ekkehard not giving an answer , he likewise dropped the stone from his hand , and went away grumbling .</p>
   <p>Poor Cappan found himself in a most pitiable condition ; for on a back which has been under the treatment of Allemannian peasants ’ fists , “ no grass will grow again so easily , ” as the expression is in those parts .</p>
   <p>The stone had caused a wound on the head which was bleeding profusely . Ekkehard , first washed his head with some rain-water , made the sign of the cross over it , to stop the bleeding , and then dressed the wound as well as he could . He thought of the parable of the Good Samaritan . The wounded man looked gratefully up at him . Slowly Ekkehard led him up to the castle , and he had to persuade him , before he would take his arm . The foot that had been wounded in the late battle , also began hurting him again , so that he limped on , with suppressed groans .</p>
   <p>On the Hohentwiel , their arrival was the cause of great and general excitement , for everybody liked the Hun . The Duchess descended into the courtyard , bestowing a friendly nod on Ekkehard , on account of his kindliness and compassion . The trespass of the monastery 's vassal against her subject , raised her just resentment .</p>
   <p>“ That shall not be forgotten , ” said she . “ Be comforted my poor mouse-catcher , for they shall pay thee damages for thy wounded pate , that will equal a dowry . And for the broken peace of the realm , we shall decree the highest possible fine . A few pounds of silver , shall not be sufficient . These convent-people , grow to be as insolent as their masters ! ”</p>
   <p>But the most indignant of all was Master Spazzo the chamberlain .</p>
   <p>“ Did I for this reason withhold my sword from his head , when he lay wounded before me , that those clodhoppers of the Schlangenhof , should pave it with their field-stones ? And what , if he was our enemy before ? Now he is baptized and I am his god-father , and bound to take care of the welfare of his soul as well as of his body . Be content , godchild ! ” cried he , rattling his sword on the stone flags , “ for as soon as thy scratch has been mended , I shall accompany thee on thy first walk , and then we will settle accounts with the convent-farmer . Hail and thunder , that we will ! So , as to make the chips fly off his head ! With those farmers , things cannot go on any longer in that way . These fellows carry shields and arms like noblemen , and instead of hunting like peasants , they keep dogs , broken in to fly at boars and bears ; and blow on their bugles , as if they were the lords of the creation . Whenever a man carries his head higher than the rest , one may be sure that he is a farmer ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Where was the trespass committed ? ” asked the Duchess .</p>
   <p>“ They dragged him from the boundary stone with the raised half-moon , to the Hunnic mound , ” said Ekkehard .</p>
   <p>“ Consequently the deed has been done , even on our own ground and territory , ” indignantly exclaimed the Duchess . “ That is too much ! Master Spazzo you must to horse ! ”</p>
   <p>“ We must to horse ! ” echoed the chamberlain fiercely .</p>
   <p>“ And demand even to-day that the Abbot of Reichenau , shall pay us both damages and fine , for the peace which has been broken ; as well as give us all possible satisfaction . Our sovereign rights shall not be trampled upon , by monastic insolence ! ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Shall not be trampled upon , by monastic insolence ! ” repeated Master</l>
     <l n="2">Spazzo , still fiercer than before .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Seldom had he entered on a mission which was more to his taste . “ We will mount , Sir Abbot ! ” cried he , going up to his room to make the necessary preparations .</p>
   <p>His green velvet waistcoat and gold-bordered chamberlain 's mantle , he quietly left in his wardrobe , choosing instead , an old and shabby grey suit . After having donned this , he put on the large greaves , which he had worn on the day of the battle . Fastening on them the biggest spurs he possessed , he tramped up and down a few times , to try their effect . Finally he stuck three waving feathers in his steel-cap , and hung his sword over his shoulders . Thus arrayed , he came down into the courtyard .</p>
   <p>“ Do look at me , most lovely maiden Praxedis , ” said he to the Greek , “ and tell me what sort of expression , my face wears now ? ” He had pushed the steel cap towards his left ear , and haughtily turned his head over his right shoulder .</p>
   <p>“ A most insolent one , indeed , Sir Chamberlain ! ” was the reply .</p>
   <p>“ Then ‘ tis all right , ” said Master Spazzo , mounting his steed . A moment later he cantered out by the castle-gate , so that he made the sparks fly about ; having the pleasant conviction , that this time , insolence was his bounden duty .</p>
   <p>On the way , he practised the part he was going to act . The storm had thrown down a fir-tree , to the roots of which the torn-up earth was still clinging . Its mighty branches blocked up the way .</p>
   <p>“ Out of the way , ecclesiastical blockhead ! ” called out Master Spazzo to the fir-tree , and when it did not move , he drew his sword .</p>
   <p>“ Forwards Falada , ” spurring his steed , so that it jumped over the tree , in one flying leap . Whilst the animal was performing this feat , Master Spazzo gave a good cut at the branches , so as to make the twigs fly about .</p>
   <p>In less than an hour and a half , he had reached the cloister-gate . The small strip of land , which at low tide , linked the shore with the island , was now above water , thus affording a passage . A serving brother opened the door for him . It was about dinner-time . The imbecile Heribald , quickly came out of the convent-garden , to satisfy his curiosity with regard to the strange horseman . He pressed up close to the horse , when Master Spazzo dismounted . The watch-dog , furiously barking , dragged at his chain , to get at the steed , so that the animal reared back , and Master Spazzo almost came to grief . When he had safely alighted , he seized his scabbard , and dealt Heribald a blow over the back .</p>
   <p>“ It is not meant for you , ” cried he , stroking his beard , “ it is for the watch-dog . Pass it on ! ”</p>
   <p>Heribald stood there , perfectly aghast , and rubbed his shoulder .</p>
   <p>“ Holy Pirmin ! ” wailed he .</p>
   <p>“ To-day there is no holy Pirmin whatever , ” said Master Spazzo in a most decisive tone .</p>
   <p>Then Heribald laughed , as if he knew his customer now .</p>
   <p>“ Heigho , gracious lord , the Huns have also been here , and there was nobody but Heribald to receive them ; but they did not speak to him so wickedly as that . ”</p>
   <p>“ The Huns , are no ducal chamberlains , fool ! ” Master Spazzo replied haughtily .</p>
   <p>In Heribald 's weak mind , the idea began to dawn , that the Huns might not be the worst guests , on German ground . He held his tongue , however , and returned to the garden , where he plucked some sage leaves and rubbed his back with them .</p>
   <p>Master Spazzo strode over the cloister-yard to the gate , which , through the cross-passage , led into the interior . He had assumed his heaviest tread . The bell that announced dinner was just ringing . One of the brothers now came quickly across the yard . Him , Master Spazzo now seized by his garment .</p>
   <p>“ Call down the Abbot ! ” said he . The monk looked at him in mute astonishment ; then , casting a side look at the chamberlain 's worn hunting-suit , he replied : “ It is the hour for our mid-day meal . If you are invited , which however seems rather doubtful to me , ” — with another ironical look , at Master Spazzo 's outward man , ... but he was spared the end of his sentence , for the chamberlain dealt the hungry brother such a genuine cuff , that he was sent reeling into the yard again , like a well thrown shuttle-cock . The mid-day sun shone on the smooth tonsure of the prostrate man .</p>
   <p>The Abbot had already been informed of the violent assault , which the convent-farmer had made on one of the Duchess 's subjects . He now heard the noise in the courtyard and on stepping up to the window , he was just in time to see the pious brother Ivo , sent flying out into the yard . “ Happy is he , who knows the secret causes of things , ” says Virgil , and Abbot Wazmann was in that happy condition . He had seen Master Spazzo 's feathers nodding over at him with a threatening aspect , from out the sombre cross-passage .</p>
   <p>“ Call down the Abbot ! ” was again shouted up from the courtyard , so that the panes of the little cell-windows vibrated .</p>
   <p>Meanwhile , the soup was getting cold in the refectory , so that the assembled brotherhood at last fell to , without waiting any longer for the Abbot .</p>
   <p>Abbot Wazmann had sent for Rudimann the cellarer . “ All this annoyance , we surely owe to that green-beak of St. Gall ! Oh , Gunzo , Gunzo ! No one ought to wish ill to his neighbour , but still I cannot help revolving in my mind , whether our strong-handed yeomen , had not done better to hurl their stones at that hypocrite Ekkehard , rather than at the Hunnic wizard ! ”</p>
   <p>A monk now shyly entered the Abbot 's room .</p>
   <p>“ You are desired to come down , ” said he in low accents . “ There is somebody down stairs , who shouts and commands , like a mighty man . ”</p>
   <p>Then the Abbot said to Rudimann the cellarer : “ It must be very bad weather , with the Duchess . I know the chamberlain , and that he is a perfect weather-cock . Whenever his mistress wears a smile round her haughty lips , then he laughs with his whole face , and when clouds have gathered on her forehead , then a downright thunderstorm will explode with him ” ...</p>
   <p>“ ... and the lightning precedes the thunder , ” added Rudimann . Heavy steps were now heard approaching .</p>
   <p>“ There 's no time to be lost , ” said the Abbot . “ Set out as quickly as you can , Cellarer , and express our deep regret to the Duchess . Take some silver coins out of the convent-box , as smart-money for the wounded man , and say that we will have prayers offered for his recovery . Get along ! you are his god-father and a clever man . ”</p>
   <p>“ It will be rather a difficult task , ” said Rudimann . “ She is sure to be downright exasperated . ”</p>
   <p>“ Take her some present , ” said the Abbot . “ Children and women are easily bribed . ”</p>
   <p>“ What sort of a present ? ” Rudimann was about to ask , when the door was thrown open , and Master Spazzo came in . His face wore the right expression .</p>
   <p>“ By the life of my Duchess !! ” exclaimed he . “ Has the Abbot of this rats ’ nest , poured lead into his ears , or has the gout got hold of his feet , that he does not come down to receive his visitors ? ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ We are taken by surprise , ” said the Abbot . “ Let me welcome you now . ”</l>
     <l n="2">He lifted his right forefinger to give him the blessing .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ I need no such welcome ! ” returned Master Spazzo . “ The Devil is the patron-saint of this day . We have been insulted , grossly insulted ! We exact a fine ; two hundred pounds of silver at the least . Out with it ! Murder and rebellion ! The sovereign rights shall not be trampled upon , by monastic insolence ! We are an ambassador ! ”</p>
   <p>He rattled his spurs on the floor .</p>
   <p>“ Excuse me , ” said the Abbot , “ we could not recognize the ambassador 's garb in your grey jacket . ”</p>
   <p>“ By the camel'shYpppHeNhair coat , of St. John the Baptist ! ” flared up Master Spazzo , “ and if I were to come to you in my shirt , the garment would be good enough , to appear as a herald , before your black cowls ! ”</p>
   <p>He put on his helmet again , from which the feathers seemed to nod triumphantly . “ Pay me at once , so that I can go on again . The air is bad here , very bad indeed . ” ...</p>
   <p>“ Allow me , ” said the Abbot , “ but we never permit a guest to depart in anger from our island . You are sharp and urgent , because you have not yet dined . Do n't disdain a meal , such as the monastery can offer , and let us talk of business afterwards . ”</p>
   <p>That a fellow in return for his rudeness , is kindly pressed to stay to dinner , made some impression on the chamberlain 's mind . He took off his helmet again . “ The sovereign rights shall not be trampled upon by monastic insolence , ” muttered he once more ; but the Abbot pointed over to the open cloister-kitchen . The fair-haired kitchen-boy was turning the spit before the fire and smacking his lips , for a lovely smell of the roast meat had entered his nostrils just then . Some covered dishes , calling up pleasant anticipations were standing in the background ; whilst a monk , bearing a huge wine-jug , was just coming up from the cellar . The aspect was too tempting , to resist any longer . So Master Spazzo laid aside his frown , and accepted the invitation .</p>
   <p>When he had arrived at the third dish , his insulting speeches became more scarce , and when the red wine of Meersburg , was sparkling in the beaker , they ceased entirely . The red wine of Meersburg was good .</p>
   <p>Meanwhile Rudimann rode out of the convent-gate . The fisherman of Ermatingen , had caught a gigantic salmon , which lay , fresh and glittering , in the vaults below . This fish had been selected by Rudimann , as a suitable present for appeasing the Duchess . Before he set out , however , he had still something to do in the copying room of the monastery . A lay-brother was to accompany him , with the huge fish , packed up in straw , lying before him on the saddle . Master Spazzo had ridden over in the haughtiest fashion , whereas Rudimann now assumed his most humble expression . He spoke shyly , and in low accents , when he asked for the Duchess . “ She is in the garden , ” was the reply . “ And my pious confrater Ekkehard ? ” asked the cellarer .</p>
   <p>“ He has accompanied the wounded Cappan , to his cottage on the Hohenstoffeln , where he is nursing him , so that he is not expected home before night . ”</p>
   <p>“ This I am truly sorry to hear , ” said Rudimann , with an evil expression of spite hovering about his lips . He then had the salmon unpacked , and put on the granite table in the middle of the courtyard . The tall lime-tree threw its cool shade over the glistening scales of the royal fish , and it was as if its large eye had still retained the power of sight , and were longingly looking away from the green branches , to the blue waves of its native element .</p>
   <p>The fish measured above six feet in length , and Praxedis screamed outright , when its straw covers were taken off . “ He does not come home before night-fall , ” muttered Rudimann , breaking off a strong branch from the tree , a piece of which he put between the jaws of the fish , so that it remained with wide open mouth . With some of the leaves , he carefully lined the inside , and then diving down into his breast-pocket , he drew out thence the parchment leaves of Gunzo 's libel . Rolling them first neatly up , he then stuck them between the jaws of the salmon .</p>
   <p>With unfeigned astonishment , Praxedis had been watching the strange proceeding .</p>
   <p>The Duchess was now seen approaching them . Humbly , Rudimann walked forwards to meet her , and imploring her indulgence for the convent 's bondsman , he told her how sorry the Abbot was ; spoke with appreciation of the wounded man ; expressed his doubts about the possibility of weather-making ; and in fact spoke on the whole with tolerable success .</p>
   <p>“ And may an unworthy present show you at least the good will of your ever faithful Reichenau , ” concluded he , stepping aside , so that the salmon could shine out in full glory . The Duchess smiled , half reconciled already ; and now her eye caught the parchment roll . “ And that ? ” said she enquiringly .</p>
   <p>“ The latest production of literature ! ” said Rudimann . With a deep bow he then took leave , and remounting his mule , hastily set out again on his way home .</p>
   <p>The red wine of Meersburg was good , and Master Spazzo was not accustomed to treat drinking as a thing that could be done quickly . He persevered before the wine-jug , like a general besieging a city ; and sitting immovably on his bench , drank like a man , silently , but much , leaving all loud demonstrations to younger persons .</p>
   <p>“ The red wine is the most sensible institution of the monastery . Have you got more of it in the cellar ? ” he said to the Abbot when the first jug was emptied . His wanting to drink more , was meant as a politeness , and a sign of reconciliation . So the second jug was brought up .</p>
   <p>“ Without injuring our sovereign rights ! ” said he grimly , when he knocked his beaker against that of the Abbot . “ Certainly , certainly , ” replied the latter with a queer side-look .</p>
   <p>The fifth hour of the evening had thus come , and the sounds of the bell were floating through the monastery .</p>
   <p>“ Excuse me , ” said the Abbot , “ we must now go to vespers , will you come with us ? ”</p>
   <p>“ I prefer waiting for you here , ” replied Master Spazzo , casting a look into the long neck of the wine-jug . It contained ample provision , for at least another hour . So he let the monks sing their vespers , and drank on , all alone .</p>
   <p>Again an hour had elapsed , when he tried to remember for what reason he had ridden over to the monastery , but the fact was that he could not recollect it any more , very clearly . The Abbot came back now .</p>
   <p>“ How did you entertain yourself ? ” asked he .</p>
   <p>“ Very well , ” said Master Spazzo . The jug was empty .</p>
   <p>“ I do not know ... ” began the Abbot .</p>
   <p>“ Certainly ! ” said Master Spazzo , nodding his head . Then the third jug was brought .</p>
   <p>Meanwhile Rudimann had returned home from his expedition . The sun was far inclining to the west ; the sky was all a-glow and faint purple gleams of light were falling through the narrow windows , on the carousing party .</p>
   <p>When Master Spazzo again drank bumpers with the Abbot , the red wine glistened like fiery gold in the cup , and he saw an aureole of light , flickering round the Abbot 's head . He tried to collect his scattered senses . “ By the life of Hadwig , ” said he solemnly , “ who are you ? ”</p>
   <p>The Abbot did not understand him .</p>
   <p>“ What did you say ? ” asked he . Then Master Spazzo recognised the voice . “ Ah so , ” cried he , striking the oak table with his fist . “ The sovereign rights shall not be trampled upon , by monastic insolence ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Certainly not , ” rejoined the Abbot .</p>
   <p>Then the chamberlain felt a spasmodic pain in the forehead , which he knew very well , and which he used to call “ the waker . ” The waker came only when he was sitting behind the wine-jug , and whenever it announced itself , it was a sure signal , that in half an hour later , the tongue would be paralysed , and the speech refuse to come . If “ the waker ” came for the second time , then the feet also were threatened with temporary paralysis . So he arose .</p>
   <p>“ These cowl-bearing monks shall not have the satisfaction of witnessing , how their wine shuts up the mouth of a ducal chamberlain , ” thought he . He stood quite erect on his feet .</p>
   <p>“ Stop , ” said the Abbot , “ we must not forget the parting draught ! ”</p>
   <p>Then the fourth jug was brought . It is true that Master Spazzo had arisen , but then between rising and going , a good many things may yet happen . He drank again , but when he wanted to put down his beaker , he placed it in the empty air , so that it fell down and broke to pieces . At this , Master Spazzo got furious ; whilst many a thought was crossing in , and confusing his muddled brains .</p>
   <p>“ Where have you got him ? ” cried he to the Abbot .</p>
   <p>“ Whom ? ”</p>
   <p>“ The convent-farmer ! Out with him , the coarse peasant , who tried to murder my god-child ! ” He threateningly advanced a few paces towards the Abbot , making only one false step .</p>
   <p>“ He is at the Schlangenhof , ” smilingly said the Abbot , “ and I willingly deliver him up to you ; only you must be pleased to fetch him from there , yourself . ”</p>
   <p>“ Murder and rebellion ! We will fetch him ! ” roared Master Spazzo , rattling his sword , as he strode towards the door . “ We will drag him out of his bed even , the rascal ! And when we have got him , by the knapsack of St. Gallus , if he ... then ... I can tell you ... ”</p>
   <p>This speech was never ended , as his tongue stood still now , like the sun at Joshuah 's bidding , during the battle with the Amorites .</p>
   <p>He stretched out his hand for the Abbot 's cup , and drank that out . But his speech did not return . A sweet placid smile now settled on the chamberlain 's lips . He stepped up to the Abbot to embrace him .</p>
   <p>“ Friend and brother ! much beloved old wine-jug ! what , if I were to dig out one of thine eyes ? ” he tried to say with stammering tongue , but he could only utter some unintelligible sounds . He pressed the Abbot vehemently to his bosom , treading on his feet at the same time , with his heavy boots .</p>
   <p>Abbot Wazmann had already been deliberating within himself , whether he should not offer a bed for the night to his exhausted guest , but the embrace and the pain in his toes , changed his hospitable designs , and he took care , that the chamberlain set out on his return .</p>
   <p>His horse stood ready saddled in the cloister-yard , where the weak-minded Heribald was sneaking about . He had fetched himself a large piece of tinder from the kitchen , which he intended to light and then to stick in the nostrils of the chamberlain 's horse ; thus to revenge himself for the blow which he had received . Master Spazzo , having scraped together the last remains of his dignity , now made his appearance . A servant with a burning torch , lighted him on his way . The Abbot had taken leave of him , at the upper-gate .</p>
   <p>Master Spazzo then bestrode his faithful steed Falada , but he was no sooner mounted , than he glided down again on the other side . Heribald who was near , hurried up to catch him in his arms , and as he did so , his bristly beard , grazed the chamberlain 's forehead .</p>
   <p>“ Art thou here also , my wise King Solomon , ” stammered Master Spazzo . “ Be my friend ! ” kissing him . Then Heribald threw away his cinder and placed his foot on it .</p>
   <p>“ Heigho , gracious Lord ! ” cried he . “ May you come home safe and sound ! You have come to us in a different manner from the Huns , and therefore your departure is different also . And yet , they too , understood how to drink wine . ”</p>
   <p>Master Spazzo who had recovered his seat , pressed the steel-cap down on his head , and tightly grasped the reins . Something was still weighing on his mind , and made him struggle with his heavy tongue . At last he recovered some of his lost strength . He lifted himself in the stirrups , and his voice obeyed now .</p>
   <p>“ And the sovereign rights shall not be trampled upon , by monastic insolence ! ” cried he , so that his voice rang loudly through the dark and silent cloister-yard .</p>
   <p>At the same time , Rudimann informed the Abbot of the success which his mission had had with the Duchess .</p>
   <p>Master Spazzo rode away . To the servant who had accompanied him with the torch , he threw a gold ring , which induced the torch-bearer , to go on with him , over the narrow causeway through the lake .</p>
   <p>He had safely reached the main land , and the cool night air was fanning his heated face . He burst out laughing . The reins he still held tightly in his right hand . The moon was shining brightly , whilst dark clouds were gathering round the peaks of the Helvetian mountains . Master Spazzo now entered the dark fir-wood . Loudly and clearly , at measured intervals , the cuckoo 's voice was heard through the silence around .</p>
   <p>Master Spazzo laughed again . Was it some pleasant recollection ? or , longing hope for the future , which made him smile so sweetly ?</p>
   <p>He stopped his horse .</p>
   <p>“ When will the wedding be ? ” called he out in the direction where the cuckoo was sitting on its tree . He counted the calls , but the cuckoo this time was indefatigable . Master Spazzo had already come to number twelve , when his patience began to wane .</p>
   <p>“ Hold thy tongue , confounded bird ! ” cried he . But the cuckoo called out for the thirteenth time .</p>
   <p>“ Five-and-fourty years we have got already , ” angrily exclaimed Master Spazzo , “ and thirteen more , would make it fifty-eight . That would be a nice time , indeed ! ”</p>
   <p>The cuckoo sang out for the fourteenth time .</p>
   <p>Here , another woke up , and also raised its voice ; a third one followed , and now there began a chorus of emulating cuckoo-voices around the tipsy chamberlain , so that all counting became impossible .</p>
   <p>Now his patience left him entirely .</p>
   <p>“ Miserable liars and breakers of marriages , that 's what you are , ” cried he furiously . “ Would that the devil would take you altogether ! ”</p>
   <p>He spurred his horse on to a quicker pace . The wood became thicker , and heavy clouds were sailing towards the moon . It was intensely dark ; the pine-trees had assumed a strange weird look , and everything was silent around . Willingly would Master Spazzo now have listened to the voice of the cuckoo , but the nightly disturber of peace had flown away , and the solitary rider began to shiver .</p>
   <p>An unshapely cloud now stealthily approached the moon , and had soon covered her up entirely . Then , Master Spazzo recollected that his nurse had told him in his early infancy , how the bad wolf Hati and Monagarm the moon-dog , persecuted the radiant astre . Looking up , he clearly recognised , both wolf and moon-dog in the sky . They had just taken hold with their teeth , of the gentle comforter of belated travellers ;— Master Spazzo was convulsed with pity . He drew his sword .</p>
   <p>“ Vince luna ! conquer , oh moon ! ” cried he , at the top of his voice , and rattling his sword against his greaves . “ Vince luna , vince luna ! ”</p>
   <p>His cries were loud , and his jingling metal sounded fierce enough , but the cloud-monsters did not loosen their hold on the moon ; only the chamberlain 's horse became frightened , and galloped at full speed through the dark wood with him .</p>
   <p>When Master Spazzo awoke on the next morning , he found himself lying at the foot of the Hunnic mound . On the meadow , he saw his mantle , whilst his black steed Falada , was indulging in a morning walk , at some distance . The saddle was hanging down on one side , and the reins were torn . Falada , however , was eating the young grass and flowers with evident enjoyment . Slowly the exhausted man lifted his head , and looked about yawning . The convent-tower of Reichenau was mirrored in the distant lake , as peacefully as if nothing whatever had happened . He tore up a bunch of grass , and held the dewy blades to his forehead . “ Vince luna ! ” said he with a bitter sweet smile . He had got a racking headache .</p>

    <head>CHAPTER XIX .</head>
     <l n="1">Burkhard the Cloister-Pupil .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Rudimann the cellarer , was no bad logician . A roll of parchment-leaves in the jaws of a salmon , must beget curiosity . Whilst Master Spazzo had been drinking the cloister-wine , his mistress and Praxedis sat in their private room , spelling out Gunzo 's libel . Ekkehard 's pupils had learned enough Latin to understand the chief part , and what remained grammatically obscure , they guessed at , and what they could not guess , they interpreted as well as they could . Praxedis was indignant .</p>
   <p>“ Is the race of scholars then everywhere like that at Byzantium ? ” exclaimed she . “ First , a gnat is metamorphosed into an elephant , and then a great war is made against the self-created monster ! The present from the Reichenau is as sour as vinegar , ” puckering up her lovely mouth , just as when she had tasted Wiborad 's crab-apples .</p>
   <p>Dame Hadwig was beset by strange feelings . A certain something told her , that the spirit which pervaded Gunzo 's libel was not a good one , and yet she felt some satisfaction at Ekkehard 's humiliation .</p>
   <p>“ I think that he has deserved this reprimand , ” said she .</p>
   <p>Then Praxedis stood up : “ Our good teacher needs many a reprimand , but then that should be our business . If we manage to cure him of his shy awkwardness , then we shall have done him a good service ; but if someone who carries a beam in his own eye , reproaches his neighbour with the moat in his ,— that is too bad ! The wicked monks have merely sent this to slander him . May I throw it out of the window , gracious mistress ? ”</p>
   <p>“ We have neither requested you to complete Ekkehard 's education , nor to throw a present we have received , out of the window , ” sharply said the Duchess . So Praxedis held her peace .</p>
   <p>The Duchess could not tear away her thoughts so easily from the elegant libel . Her ideas with respect to the fair-haired monk , had undergone a great change since the day on which he carried her over the cloister courtyard . Not to be understood in a moment of excited feeling , is like being disdained . The sting remains for ever in the heart . Whenever her eyes now chanced to light on him , it did not make her heart beat any the quicker . Sometimes it was pity which made her gaze kindly on him again ; but not that sweet pity out of which love springs , like the lily out of the cool soil . It contained a bitter grain of contempt .</p>
   <p>Through Gunzo 's libel , even Ekkehard 's learning , which the women until then had been wont to treat with great respect , was laid prostrate in the dust ,— so what was there now left to admire ? The silent working and dreaming of his soul , was not understood by the Duchess , and a delicate timidity is but too often considered folly , by others . His going out into the fields in the fresh morning , to read Solomon 's song , came too late . He should have done that last autumn ....</p>
   <p>Evening had come .</p>
   <p>“ Has Ekkehard returned home yet ? ” asked the Duchess .</p>
   <p>“ No , ” said Praxedis . “ Neither has Master Spazzo returned . ”</p>
   <p>“ Then take yonder candlestick , ” said Dame Hadwig , “ and carry up the parchment-leaves to Ekkehard 's tower . He must not remain ignorant of the works of his fellow-brothers . ”</p>
   <p>The Greek maid obeyed , but unwillingly . In the closet up in the tower , the air was close and hot . In picturesque disorder , books and other things were strewn about . On the oak table , the gospel of St. Matthew lay opened at the following verses :</p>
   <p>“ But when Herod 's birthday was kept , the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod .</p>
   <p>“ Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ And she , being before instructed of her mother , said , ‘ Give me here</l>
     <l n="2">John Baptist 's head on a charger . ’ ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The priestly stole , the Duchess 's Christmas-gift to Ekkehard , lay beside it . Its golden fringes were hanging over the little bottle with the water from the Jordan , which the blind Thieto had given him .</p>
   <p>Praxedis pushed back the other things , placing Gunzo 's libel on the table . When she had arranged everything , she felt sorry . Just about to go , she turned back once more , opened the window , and gathering a branch of the luxuriant ivy which was winding its garlands round the tower , she threw it over the parchment-leaves .</p>
   <p>Ekkehard came home very late . He had been nursing the wounded Cappan , but had found it far harder work , to comfort his tall spouse . After the first wailing was over and her tears had been dried , her speech until sunset had been nothing but one great curse against the convent-farmer ; and when she raised her strong arms and spoke of scratching his eyes out , of pouring henbane into his ears , and breaking his teeth , whilst her long brown tresses threateningly fluttered in the air , it needed a great effort to quiet her .</p>
   <p>Yet he had succeeded at last .</p>
   <p>In the silence of night , Ekkehard read the leaves which the Greek maid had put on his table . His hand played with a wild rose , which he had culled in the fir-wood when riding home , whilst his eyes took in the spiteful attacks of the Italian scholar .</p>
   <p>“ How is it , ” thought he , inhaling the soft fragrance of the flower , “ that so much that is written with ink , cannot deny its origin ? All ink is made of the gall-nut , and all gall-nuts spring from the poisonous sting of the wasp . ” ...</p>
   <p>With a serene countenance he finally laid aside the yellow parchment-leaves . “ A good work ! an industrious good work !— well , the peewit is also an important personage amongst the feathered tribe , but the nightingale does not heed its singing . ” ... He slept very well after he had read it .</p>
   <p>On coming back from the castle-chapel the next morning , he met Praxedis in the courtyard .</p>
   <p>“ How are you , venerable baptizer of Hunnic idolaters , ” said she lightly . “ I am really very anxious about you . I dreamt that a big brown sea-crab had swum up the Rhine , and from the Rhine into the Bodensee , and from thence , he came up to our castle ; and he had got a pair of sharp pincers , and with them he pinched you very badly . The sea-crab 's name was Gunzo . Say , have you many more such good friends ? ”</p>
   <p>Ekkehard smiled .</p>
   <p>“ Most likely , I do not please many a one , who does not please me either , ” said he . “ He , who comes into contact with sooty kettles , easily gets blackened himself . ”</p>
   <p>“ You , however , seem to be wholly indifferent about it , ” said Praxedis . “ You ought to be thinking already about the reply . Boil the crab , till it gets dark red . Then he will not bite you again . ”</p>
   <p>“ The answer to this , ” replied Ekkehard , “ has been given already by another : ‘ whosoever shall say to his brother , Raca , shall be in danger of the council : but whosoever shall say , thou fool , shall be in danger of hell fire . ’ ”</p>
   <p>“ You are extremely mild and pious , ” said Praxedis , “ but take care how you get on in the world with that . Whoever does not defend his skin , will be flayed , and even a miserable enemy should not be considered quite harmless . Seven wasps together will kill a horse , you know . ”</p>
   <p>The Greek maid was right . Silent contempt of an unworthy antagonist , is easily interpreted into weakness . But Ekkehard acted according to his nature .</p>
   <p>Praxedis approaching him still closer , so that he started back , now added : “ Shall I give you another piece of advice , most reverend Master ? ” He silently nodded in the affirmative .</p>
   <p>“ Then let me tell you , that you have again become far too serious of late . To look at you , one would think that you were going to play at nine pins with the moon and stars . We are now in the middle of summer , and your habit must be exceedingly warm . Get yourself some linen garment , and perhaps it would not harm you either to cool your head a little in yonder spring ,— but above all be merry and cheerful . The Duchess might otherwise become indifferent towards you . ”</p>
   <p>Ekkehard wanted to take her hand . Sometimes he felt as if Praxedis were his good angel ; but at that moment , Master Spazzo on horseback , entered the courtyard at a slow and lingering pace . His head was bent towards the pommel , and a leaden smile rested on his tired features . He was half asleep .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Your face has undergone a great change since yesterday , ” called out</l>
     <l n="2">Praxedis to him . “ Why do the sparks not fly out any more from under</l>
     <l n="3">Falada 's hoofs ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">With a vacant stare , he looked down at her . Everything was dancing</l>
     <l n="5">before his eyes .</l>

     <l n="6">“ Have you brought home a considerable smart-money , Sir chamberlain ? ”</l>
     <l n="7">asked Praxedis .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="8">“ Smart-money ? for whom ? ” stolidly said Master Spazzo .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ For poor Cappan ! Why , I verily believe that you have eaten a handful of poppy-seed , not to know any more , for what purpose you rode out . ” ...</p>
   <p>“ Poppy-seed ? ” said Master Spazzo in the same drowsy tone . “ Poppy-seed ? No . But wine of Meersburg , red wine of Meersburg , unmeasured quantities of red Meersburg , yes ! ”</p>
   <p>Heavily he dismounted , and then retired into the privacy of his apartments . The report about the result of his mission , was not given . Praxedis cast an astonished look at the departing chamberlain , as she did not wholly understand the reason of Master Spazzo 's peculiar frame of mind .</p>
   <p>“ Have you never heard , that to a grown-up man , neither springs , woods , nor singing of birds are half so refreshing as old wine ? ” said Ekkehard , smilingly . “ But even as the Jewish prophet boy said to King Darius , when his generals and officers were quarrelling around his throne , about which of them was the strongest : ‘ The wine is the strongest of all ! for it conquers the men who drink it , and leads their minds astray . ’ ”</p>
   <p>Praxedis had approached the wall , and was looking downward .</p>
   <p>“ Do look , you radiant star of science , ” she now said to Ekkehard , “ who may that dainty ecclesiastical little man be , who is coming up here ? ”</p>
   <p>Ekkehard bent over the wall and looked down the steep rocky hill-side . Between the hazel-bushes , bordering the footpath that led up to the castle , walked a boy with wavy brown locks , wearing a monk 's habit , coming down to his ankles ; sandals on his naked feet , a leathern knapsack on his back , and carrying a staff with an iron point , in his hand . Ekkehard did not recognise him as yet .</p>
   <p>After a few minutes he reached the castle-gate . There he turned round , and shading his eyes with his hand , he gazed over the wide beautiful landscape , stretching out before him . Then he entered the courtyard and approached Ekkehard with measured steps . It was Burkhard the cloister-pupil ; the son of Ekkehard 's sister , who had come over from Constance , to pay a holiday visit to his youthful uncle .</p>
   <p>He made a solemn face , and pronounced his greeting as if he had learned it by heart .</p>
   <p>Ekkehard embraced the well-behaved boy , who in all the fifteen years of his life had never done a downright foolish thing . Burkhard was the bearer of sundry kind messages from St. Gall , as well as of an epistle of Master Ratpert , who , being busy just then with some translation , asked Ekkehard 's advice , in what style and measure he was wont to translate certain difficult passages in Virgil . “ Hail , prosperity and progress in knowledge , ” was the letter 's parting salutation .</p>
   <p>Ekkehard at once began to question his nephew about all the brothers , but Praxedis soon interrupted him .</p>
   <p>“ Please to let the pious youngster rest himself first . A parched tongue , is not adapted for speech . Come with me , my little man , thou shalt be a more welcome visitor , than the wicked Rudimann from the Reichenau ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Father Rudimann ? ” exclaimed the boy . “ Him I know also . ”</p>
   <p>“ How did you get to know him ? ” asked Ekkehard .</p>
   <p>“ He paid us a visit but a few days since , and brought a big letter to the Abbot , as well as a treatise , which they say contains a great deal about yourself , beloved uncle , and is not much in your praise . ”</p>
   <p>“ Hear , hear ! ” said Praxedis .</p>
   <p>“ And when he had taken leave , he only went as far as the church , where he prayed till night-fall . Now he must have known every nook and corner in the monastery , for when the sleeping-bell sounded , he slunk on tiptoe to the great dormitory , there to listen to what the brothers might say about you and the contents of the treatise . The night-lamp burnt but dimly , so that he could crouch down unseen in a dark corner . But at midnight , Father Notker Peppercorn , came to make the round and to inspect whether everyone had fastened his girdle tidily round his garment , and whether no knife or other dangerous weapon was perchance in the bedroom . He drew out the stranger from his hiding-place ; and the brothers woke up , and the big lanthorn was lighted , and then they all rushed on him , armed with sticks and scourges from the scourging-room , and there was a tremendous noise and uproar , although the Abbot and Dean tried to quiet them . Notker Peppercorn was also highly indignant : ‘ The devil goes about in disguise , trying whom he may devour , ’ cried he , ‘ but we have caught the devil , and will scourge him ! ’</p>
   <p>“ But Father Rudimann in spite of all , was yet inclined to be saucy : ‘ I declare ye excellent youths , ’ said he , ‘ if I knew where the carpenter had left some outlet , I should creep away on my hands and feet ; but now , when chance has delivered me into your hands , mind that you do not heap insults on the head of your guest ! ’ Then they all got quite furious , and dragged him out into the scourging-room , where he had to go down on his knees to escape scot-free ; and when finally the Abbot said : ‘ We will let the fox go home to his den , ’ he expressed his thanks in very polite terms .</p>
   <p>“ On my way , yesterday , I met a cart laden with two big wine-tuns , which the driver told me were a present from the cellarer of the Reichenau , for the friendly reception he had met with , at St. Gall . ”</p>
   <p>“ Of all this , Master Rudimann did not breathe a word , when he called on us yesterday , ” said Praxedis . “ For that recital , thou verily deservest a piece of cake , my darling boy . Thou canst tell a story as well as any older person . ”</p>
   <p>“ Oh , ” said the cloister-pupil half offended , “ that 's nothing ! But I am going to write a poem about it , entitled , ‘ the wolf 's invasion of the sheep-fold , and subsequent punishment . ’ I have already got it half ready in my head . That will be fine ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Dost thou also make poems , my young nephew ? ” gaily said Ekkehard .</p>
   <p>“ That would be a nice cloister-pupil indeed , who with fourteen years could make no poem ! ” was the boy 's reply . “ My hymn in praise of the Archangel Michael , with double-rhymed hexametres , I was permitted to read out to the Abbot , who was pleased to call my verses , ‘ a glittering string of pearls . ’ And then my Sapphic ode , in honour of the pious Wiborad is likewise very pretty . Shall I recite it to you ! ”</p>
   <p>“ For God 's sake ! ” cried Praxedis . “ Dost thou think that one merely drops down into our courtyard to begin at once reciting odes ? Thou hadst better eat thy cake first . ”</p>
   <p>She ran off to the kitchen , leaving Ekkehard 's learned nephew under the linden-tree , to talk with his uncle . He profited by the opportunity to speak a good deal about the trivium and quadrivium , and as the Hohentwiel just then threw a delicately drawn shadow on the plain below , the cloister-pupil indulged in a prolix discussion about the cause of all shadows , which he pronounced with great assurance to spring from a compact body standing in the way of light ; proving afterwards the vanity of all other definitions .</p>
   <p>Like the waters from a fountain , did the scientific flood stream forth from the youthful lips . In astronomy also he was quite at home , and his uncle had to listen patiently to the praise of Zoroaster , and King Ptolemaeus of Egypt . Further he had to undergo a strict examination himself , about the shape and application of the astrolabe , and finally the curly-headed nephew began to demonstrate how absurd was the opinion of those , who believed that on the other side of the globe lived the honourable race of the antipodes !</p>
   <p>All these fine things he had learned only five days ago ,— but at last his uncle did what the brave Emperor Otto did , when the famous Bishop of Rheims , and Otrich the cathedral-schoolmaster of Magdeburg and hundreds of learned abbots and scholars , held their great contest about the basis and classification of theoretical philosophy , before him ,— namely he yawned . At that critical moment , Praxedis reappeared with a delicious cherry-tart and a basket filled with various fruits , and these good things speedily gave a more natural turn to the thoughts of the fifteen-years-old philosopher . Like a well-educated boy , he first said grace before eating , as was customary in the monastery , and then he turned his attentions to the annihilation of the cherry-tart , leaving the question of the antipodes to some future time .</p>
   <p>Praxedis now turned to Ekkehard . “ The Duchess bids me tell you , ” she said with mock earnestness , “ that she feels inclined to return to the study of Virgil . She is anxious to learn the final fate of Queen Dido ,— and so we are to begin again this very evening . Remember that you are to wear a more cheerful expression than the present one , ” added she in a lower key , “ as it is a delicate attention , in order to show you that in spite of a certain treatise , her confidence in your learning has not been destroyed . ”</p>
   <p>This was a fact ; but Ekkehard received the news with a start of terror . To be again together with the two women as he used to be ,— the mere thought was painful . He had not yet learnt to forget a certain Good Friday morning .</p>
   <p>He now slapped his nephew on the shoulder , so as to make him start , and said : “ Thou hast not come here to spend thy holidays merely with fishing and bird-catching , Burkhard . This afternoon we will read Virgil with the gracious Duchess , and thou shalt be present also . ”</p>
   <p>He thought to place the boy like a shield between the Duchess and his thoughts .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Very well , ” replied Burkhard , with cherry-dyed lips . “ I prefer Virgil</l>
     <l n="2">a great deal to hunting and riding , and I shall request the Lady</l>
     <l n="3">Duchess to teach me some Greek . After that visit when they took you</l>
     <l n="4">away with them , the cloister-pupils often said , that she knew more</l>
     <l n="5">Greek than all the venerable fathers of the monastery , put together .</l>
     <l n="6">They say that she learnt it by sorcery . And although I am the first in</l>
     <l n="7">Greek ... ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Then you will certainly be Abbot in five years , and in twenty , holy father at Rome , ” said Praxedis mockingly . “ Meanwhile you would do well to wash your blue lips in yonder spring . ”</p>
   <p>At the fourth hour of the evening , Ekkehard was waiting in the pillared hall below , ready to resume his reading of the AEneid . More than six months had gone by , during which Virgil had been laid aside . Ekkehard felt oppressed . He opened one of the windows through which the pleasant cool air of evening came streaming in .</p>
   <p>The cloister-pupil was turning over the leaves of the Latin manuscript .</p>
   <p>“ When the Duchess speaks to thee , mind to be very polite , ” said Ekkehard . But he replied with a complacent air : “ with such a grand lady , I shall only speak in verse . She shall see that a pupil from the inner school stands before her . ”</p>
   <p>Here , the Duchess entered , followed by Praxedis . She greeted Ekkehard with a slight bend of the head . Without appearing to notice the boy , she sat down in her richly carved arm-chair . Burkhard had made her a graceful bow , from the lower end of the table , where he stood .</p>
   <p>Ekkehard opened the book , when the Duchess said indifferently : “ Why is that boy here ? ”</p>
   <p>“ He is but a humble auditor , ” said Ekkehard , “ who , inspired by the wish to learn the Greek language , ventures to approach such a noble teacher . He would be very happy , if from your lips he could learn ... ”</p>
   <p>But before Ekkehard had ended his speech , Burkhard had approached the Duchess . With eyes cast down , and a mixture of shyness and confidence , he said with a clear intonation of the rhythm :</p>
   <p>“ Esse velim Graecus , cum vix sim , dom'na<span corresp="#note1" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>, Latinus . ”</p>
   <p>It was a faultless hexametre .</p>
   <p>Dame Hadwig listened with astonishment ; for a curly-headed boy , who could make an hexametre , was an unheard-of thing in the Allemannic lands then . And moreover he had improvised it in her honour . Therefore she was really pleased with the youthful verse-maker .</p>
   <p>“ Let me look at thee a little nearer , ” said she drawing him towards her . She was charmed with him , for he had a lovely boyish face , with a red and white complexion , so soft and transparent , that the blue veins could be seen through it .</p>
   <p>In luxuriant masses , the brown curls fell down over his temples , whilst a bold , aquiline nose rose over the learned youthful lips , as if it were mocking their utterance . Then , Dame Hadwig put her arms round the boy , and kissing him on both lips and cheeks , fondled him like a child almost , and finally pushing a cushioned footstool close to her side , bade him sit down on it .</p>
   <p>“ To begin with , thou shalt gather something else than Greek wisdom from my lips , ” said she jestingly , giving him another kiss . “ But now be a good boy , and quickly say some more well-set verses . ”</p>
   <p>She pushed back his curls from his blushing face ; but the cloister-pupil 's metrical powers were not discomposed even by the kiss of a Duchess . Ekkehard had stepped up to the window , where he looked out towards the Alps , whilst Burkhard without hesitation , recited the following lines :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Non possum prorsus dignos componere versus ,</l>
     <l n="2">Nam nimis expavi duce me libante suavi . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">He had again produced two faultless hexametres .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The Duchess laughed out gaily . “ Well , I verily believe that thou didst greet the light of this world with a Latin verse , at thy birth ? That flows from thy lips as if Virgil had arisen from his grave . But why art thou frightened when I kiss thee ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Because you are so grand , and proud and beautiful , ” said the boy .</p>
   <p>“ Never mind , ” replied the Duchess . “ He , who with the fresh kiss yet burning on his lips , can improvise such perfect verses , cannot be very much terrified . ”</p>
   <p>Making him stand up before her , she asked him : “ And why art thou so very eager to learn Greek ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Because they say , that if a man knows Greek , he can become so clever as to hear the grass grow , ” was the ready answer . “ Ever since my fellow-pupil Notker with the large lip , has vaunted himself , that he were going to learn all Aristotle by heart , and then translate it into German , I have been uneasy in my mind . ”</p>
   <p>Dame Hadwig again laughed merrily . “ Let us begin then ? Dost thou know the antiphon , ‘ Ye seas and rivers praise the Lord ? ’ ”</p>
   <p>“ Yes , ” said Burkhard .</p>
   <p>“ Then repeat after me , ‘ [ Greek : Thalassi kai potami , eulogite ton kurion . ] ’ ”</p>
   <p>The boy repeated it .</p>
   <p>“ Now sing it ! ” He did so .</p>
   <p>Ekkehard looked over reproachfully at them . The Duchess interpreted the look aright .</p>
   <p>“ So , now thou hast learnt six words already , ” she said to Burkhard , “ and as soon as thou wilt ask for it in hexametres , thou shalt be taught some more . For the present , sit down there at my feet , and listen attentively . We will read Virgil now . ”</p>
   <p>Then , Ekkehard began the fourth canto of the AEneid ; and read of the sorrows of Dido , who is ever beset by thoughts of the noble Trojan guest , whose words and looks are all deeply engraven on her inmost heart . And she speaks out her grief thus to her sister :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ If it were not decreed , in the depth of my soul , that I never ,</l>
     <l n="2">Wedlock again would contract , with any man that is living ,</l>
     <l n="3">If I , the torches of Hymen , and bridal room not detested ,</l>
     <l n="4">Might be so weak perhaps , to give way to this present temptation .</l>
     <l n="5">Anna , to thee confess , that since my beloved Sichaeus ,</l>
     <l n="6">Fell with the wound in his heart , at the feet of the blood-dripping</l>
     <l n="7">Lares ,</l>
     <l n="8">He alone , has succeeded in touching my heart , and disturbing .</l>
     <l n="9">All the peace of my soul , that is changed into strife and</l>
     <l n="10">contention . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But Dame Hadwig had not much sympathy with the sorrows of the Carthaginian widowed queen . She leaned back in her arm-chair and looked up at the ceiling . She found no longer any similarity between herself and the desolate woman in the book .</p>
   <p>“ Stop a moment , ” cried she . “ How very clear it is , that this is written by a man . He wants to humiliate women ! It is all false ! Who on earth would fall so madly in love with an utter stranger ? ”</p>
   <p>“ That , Virgil has to answer for , ” said Ekkehard . “ History no doubt bequeathed the facts to him . ”</p>
   <p>“ Then , the present generation of women is somewhat stronger-minded , ” said the Duchess , making a sign to him to continue . She was almost offended with Virgil 's description . Perhaps because she was reminded of certain Didonian feelings which she had experienced herself , one day . Things had not always been , as they now were .</p>
   <p>And he read on , how Anna advises her sister not to struggle any longer against her growing passion ; and how ,— though peace and rest might be implored for , by sacrifices on the altars of the mighty Gods ,— the relentless , devouring flame was yet burning on inwardly , and the wound did not heal .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">And again the poor deluded queen , desires to hear of the battles round</l>
     <l n="2">Ilium , and :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ When she was left then alone , and the rays of the queen of the</l>
     <l n="4">heavens ,</l>
     <l n="5">Fell on her desolate couch , and the stars were silently shining ,</l>
     <l n="6">Seeming to mock at her grief , which , excluding the pain-stilling</l>
     <l n="7">slumber ,</l>
     <l n="8">Kept her awake at night , when she thought of him , her beloved .</l>
     <l n="9">Many a time , to delude her heart , and stifle its longings</l>
     <l n="10">She would fondle the boy , the image of him , of AEneas . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>A low giggle here interrupted the reading . The cloister-pupil , sitting at the Duchess 's feet , so as almost to touch her wavy robes , had listened attentively until now , when he struggled in vain to stifle a rising laugh , which at last broke out , though he had covered up his face with his hands to keep it back .</p>
   <p>“ What is the matter now , young verse-maker ? ” asked the Duchess .</p>
   <p>“ I could not help thinking , ” said the boy with some embarrassment , “ that if my gracious mistress were the queen Dido , I should have been acting the part of Ascanius , when you deigned to kiss and caress me . ”</p>
   <p>The Duchess looked down sharply at the boy . “ Art thou inclined to be naughty ? Well ‘ tis no wonder , ” added she , pointing at his curls , “ for the precocious youth has already got grey hairs on his head . ”</p>
   <p>... “ That is from the night when they slew Romeias , ” the cloister-pupil wanted to say , but could not , as the Duchess sharply continued : “ That comes from thy forwardness , which makes thee say foolish things , when thou hadst better be silent . Get up little man ! ”</p>
   <p>Burkhard rose from the stool , and stood blushingly before her .</p>
   <p>“ So , ” said she , “ now go to Praxedis and tell her that as a punishment , all thy grey hairs are to be cut off , and beg her to do it for you . That will be a good cure for untimely laughter . ”</p>
   <p>The boy 's eyes filled with big tears , but he dared not disobey . So he went up to Praxedis , who had some sympathy for him , since she had heard that he had been Romeias ’ companion , during his last hours .</p>
   <p>“ I shall not hurt thee , my little saint , ” she whispered drawing him towards her . He knelt down before her , bending his young head over her lap , whilst she took a big pair of scissors out of her straw-braided work-basket , and executed the punishment .</p>
   <p>At first , the cloister-pupil 's sobs , sounded dolefully ,— for he who allowed a strange hand to touch his locks , was considered to be deeply dishonoured ,— but Praxedis 's soft little hand caressingly patted his cheeks , after having ruffled his curls , so that , in spite of all punishment , he felt almost happy and his mouth smilingly caught up the last falling tear .</p>
   <p>Ekkehard looked down silently for a while . Frivolous , though graceful jesting , makes a sad heart but sadder . He was hurt that the Duchess had thus interrupted his reading . Looking up into her eyes , he found no comfort there . “ She trifles with thee , as well as she trifles with the boy , ” thought he , closing the book and rising from his seat .</p>
   <p>“ You are right , ” said he to Dame Hadwig , “ ‘ tis all wrong . Dido ought to laugh , and AEneas to go and kill himself with his sword . Then , it would be quite natural . ”</p>
   <p>She gazed at him with an unsteady look . “ What is the matter with you ? ” asked she .</p>
   <p>“ I cannot read any more , ” replied he .</p>
   <p>The Duchess had risen also .</p>
   <p>“ If you do not care to read any longer , ” she said with an apparently indifferent expression , “ there are still other ways and means to pass one 's time . What say you , if I were to ask you to tell us some graceful tale ,— you might choose whatever you liked . There are still many grand and beautiful things , besides your Virgil . Or , you might invent something yourself . I see that you are oppressed by some care . You neither like to read , nor to go out into the country . Everything hurts your eyes , as you say . I think that your mind lacks some great task which we will now give you . ”</p>
   <p>“ What could I invent ? ” replied Ekkehard . “ Is it not enough happiness to be the echo of a master , like Virgil ? ” He looked with a veiled eye at the Duchess . “ I should only be able to chant elegies very sad ones too . ”</p>
   <p>“ Nothing else ? ” said Dame Hadwig reproachfully . “ Have our ancestors not gone out to war , and let their bugles sound the alarum through the world , and have they not fought battles as grand as those of AEneas ? Do you believe that the great Emperor Charles would have had all the old national songs collected and sung , if they had been nothing but chaff ? Must you then , take everything out of your Latin books ? ”</p>
   <p>“ I know nothing , ” repeated Ekkehard .</p>
   <p>“ But you must know something , ” persisted the Duchess . “ If we , who live here in this castle , were to sit together of an evening and talk of old tales and legends , I should n't wonder , if we should produce something more than the whole of the AEneid contains ? ‘ Tis true that the pious son of the Emperor Charles , did not care any more for the old heroic songs , and preferred listening to whining psalms ; until he died , diseased in body and mind ; but we still cling to those old tales . Do tell us such a story , Master Ekkehard , and we will gladly spare you your Virgil with his love-sick queen . ”</p>
   <p>But Ekkehard 's thoughts were quite differently occupied . He shook his head like one who is dreaming .</p>
   <p>“ I see that you want some stimulant , ” said the Duchess . “ Above all , a good example will inspire you . Praxedis , prepare thyself , and likewise tell our chamberlain , that we are going to entertain ourselves to-morrow , with the telling of old legends . Let everybody be well prepared . ”</p>
   <p>She took up Virgil and threw it under the table , as a sign that a new aera was to begin forthwith .</p>
   <p>Her idea was certainly good , and well conceived . Only the cloister-pupil who had rested his head on Praxedis 's lap , whilst the Duchess spoke , had not quite taken in her meaning .</p>

    <head>CHAPTER XX .</head>
     <l n="1">The old German Legends .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>On the top of the Hohentwiel and within the castle-walls , a very pretty , though small garden had been laid out on a steep projecting rock , encircled by a wall . It was a lovely place ; well-fitted for observation . The hill was so steep there , that by leaning over the parapet , one could throw a stone down into the valley below , and he , who delighted in an extensive view , could there enjoy it to his heart 's content ; his eye taking in , mountain and plain , lake and distant Alps ; no obstacle barring the view .</p>
   <p>In a corner of this little garden , an old maple-tree spread out its branches undisturbed . Its winged seeds were already ripe and brown , fluttering down on the black garden earth below . A ladder had been placed against its greyish green trunk , at the foot of which , Praxedis was standing , holding the corner of a long and heavy piece of tent-cloth ; whilst Burkhard , the cloister-pupil , was sitting high up in the branches , trying to fasten the other ends with the help of a hammer and some nails .</p>
   <p>“ Attention , ” called out Praxedis . “ I verily believe that thou art watching yonder stork , flying over to Radolfszell . Take care , thou paragon of all Latin scholars , and do not drive the nail into the air ! ”</p>
   <p>Praxedis had lifted the cloth with her left hand , and when the cloister-pupil now let go the other end , it fell down heavily , tearing out the badly fixed nails , and entirely burying the Greek maid under its massy folds .</p>
   <p>“ There now ,— thou awkward boy ! ” scolded Praxedis , as soon as she had disentangled herself from the coarse wrapper . “ I suppose I must look out whether there are not anymore grey hairs to be cut off ! ”</p>
   <p>Scarcely had she pronounced the last word , when the cloister-pupil became visible on the ladder , and jumping down from the middle , he now stood on the cloth , before Praxedis .</p>
   <p>“ Sit down , ” said he , “ I do not mind in the least , being punished again . I have dreamt this very night , that you cut off all my curls , and that I had returned to school with an entirely bald head ,— and yet I was not sorry for it . ”</p>
   <p>Praxedis lightly clapped his head . “ Do n't grow too impudent during the holidays , my little man ; or thy back will prove a nice floor for the rod to dance upon , when thou gettest back to thy cloister-school . ”</p>
   <p>But the cloister-pupil was not thinking of the cool auditories of his monastery . He remained standing motionless before Praxedis .</p>
   <p>“ Well ? ” said she , “ what is the matter ? ” “ what dost thou want ? ”</p>
   <p>“ A kiss , ” replied the pupil of the liberal arts .</p>
   <p>“ Heigho ! nothing else ? ” laughed Praxedis . “ What reasons has thy wisdom for such a demand ? ”</p>
   <p>“ The Lady Duchess has kissed me also , ” said Burkhard , “ and you have often asked me to tell you all about that day , when I fled with my brave , old friend Romeias before the Huns , and how he fought like a hero , as he was . All this I shall not tell you , unless you will give me a kiss . ”</p>
   <p>“ Listen , ” said the Greek maid with a mock serious face , “ I have something very wonderful to tell you . ”</p>
   <p>“ What ? ” asked the boy eagerly .</p>
   <p>“ That thou art the naughtiest little rogue , that has ever set his foot on the threshold of a cloister-school , ” continued she , and suddenly throwing her white arms around him , she gave him a hearty kiss on the nose .</p>
   <p>“ Well done , I declare ! ” called out a deep bass voice from the garden-door , at the very moment when she playfully pushed the boy away from her . It was Master Spazzo .</p>
   <p>“ Ah , is it you ? ” said Praxedis , perfectly unabashed . “ You are just in time , Sir Chamberlain , to assist us in fixing this canvass . I shall never get it done , with that silly boy ! ”</p>
   <p>“ So it appears , ” said Master Spazzo , with a cutting look at the cloister-pupil , who , standing rather in awe of the chamberlain 's fierce-looking moustache , slipped away between some rose-bushes . Astronomy and the metrics , Aristotle in the original language , and red girlish lips , formed a strange medley in the youthful mind .</p>
   <p>“ Are there no fitter objects for kisses in this castle , gentle maiden ? ” asked Master Spazzo .</p>
   <p>“ If one should ever feel so inclined , ” was Praxedis ’ answer , “ the fitter objects ride away and stray about in night and darkness ; and when they return at daytime , they look as if they had been chasing the will-o ’ - the-wisps all night . ”</p>
   <p>Herewith , Master Spazzo was answered . He had made a vow not to betray a single word of his nightly adventures ; cuckoo , and vince luna included .</p>
   <p>“ In what way can I help you ? ” said he humbly .</p>
   <p>“ In making a bower , ” said Praxedis . “ In the cool hours of the evening , the Duchess will hold court here , and then stories are to be told ; old stories , Sir chamberlain , the more wonderful , the better ! Our Mistress has grown tired of Latin , and wishes for something else . Something original , that has not yet been written down ,— you are also expected to contribute your mite ! ”</p>
   <p>“ The Lord protect my soul ! ” exclaimed Master Spazzo . “ If under the reign of a woman everything was not wondrously strange , I really should begin to wonder at this . Are there no wandering minstrels and lute-players left , who , for a helmet full of wine , and a leg of deer , will sing themselves hoarse with such tales ? We are rising in estimation ! ‘ Vagabonds , jugglers , bards and the like strolling idlers , are to be flogged , and if they complain , they are to receive a man 's shadow on a wall , as an indemnification . '[ 2 ] I thank you for that honour ! ”</p>
   <p>“ You will do what you are commanded , like a faithful vassal , who , moreover has still to render a report about a certain business , transacted over the monastic wine-jug , ” said Praxedis . “ It will be merrier at any rate , than to spell out Latin ! Have you no desire to out-rival the learned Master Ekkehard ? ”</p>
   <p>This hint made some impression on the chamberlain 's mind . “ Give me the corners of the cloth , ” said he , “ so that I may fix them . ” He then mounted the ladder , and fastened the ends to the branches . Opposite , were some tall poles , entwined with the blue blossomed bean-plant . To these , Praxedis tied the other two corners , and very soon the greyish white canvass formed a nice roof , contrasting pleasantly with the green foliage .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ It would be a very cozy place for drinking the vesper wine , ” said</l>
     <l n="2">Master Spazzo half sadly at the idea of that which was to come .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Praxedis , meanwhile arranged the table and seats . The Duchess 's stuffed arm-chair , with the finely carved back , touched the stem of the maple-tree , whilst some low stools were placed round for the others . Fetching down her lute , Praxedis put it on the table beside a huge nosegay which she had ordered Burkhard to make . Finally , she tied a strong thread of red silk , first to the trunk , then , round the bean-plantation and from there , to the wall , so as to leave free only a narrow entrance .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ There , ” said she gaily , “ now our fairy-hall is hedged in , like King</l>
     <l n="2">Laurins ’ rose-garden . The walls were not very difficult to make . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The Duchess , taking much pleasure in her idea , adorned herself with particular care on that day . It was still somewhat early to be called evening , when she went down to the bower . She was really a dazzling apparition , as she proudly sailed along , in her flowing robes . The sleeves and seams were richly embroidered with gold , and a steel-gray tunic , held by jewelled clasps , fell down to the ground like a mantle . On her head she wore a soft transparent tissue , a sort of veil ; fastened to a golden head-band . Pulling out a rose from Burkhard 's nosegay , she stuck it in , between the head-band and the veil .</p>
   <p>The cloister-pupil , who was fast forgetting his classics and liberal arts , had begged leave to carry the Duchess 's train , and it was in her honour that he had donned a pair of very queer-looking , pointed shoes , adorned on both sides with ears . He certainly felt a good deal elated at the happiness of being allowed to act as page to such a mistress .</p>
   <p>Praxedis and Master Spazzo came in after her . The Duchess , casting her eyes hastily about , now said : “ Has Master Ekkehard , for whose especial benefit we have appointed this evening ,— become invisible ? ”</p>
   <p>“ My uncle must be ill , ” said Burkhard . “ He paced up and down in his room with hasty steps yesterday evening , and when I wanted to show him the different constellations , such as the bear , and Orion and the faintly glittering Pleiads , he gave me no answer whatever . At last , he threw himself on his couch with all his clothes on , and talked a good deal in his sleep .</p>
   <p>“ What did he say ? ” asked the Duchess .</p>
   <p>“ He said , ‘ oh my dove that art in the clefts of the rock , and in the secret places of the stones ; let me see thy countenance , let me hear thy voice . For sweet is thy voice and thy countenance is lovely . ’ And another time he said : ‘ Why do you kiss the boy before my eyes ? what do I hope still , and why do I tarry yet in the Lybian lands ? ’ ”</p>
   <p>“ That is a nice state of things , I declare , ” whispered Master Spazzo into the Greek maid 's ear . “ Does that rest on your conscience ? ”</p>
   <p>The Duchess , however , said to Burkhard : “ I suppose that thou hast been dreaming thyself . Run up to thy uncle and make him come down as we are waiting for him . ”</p>
   <p>She sat down gracefully on her throne-like seat . The cloister-pupil soon came back with Ekkehard , who was looking very pale , whilst his eyes had something wild and sad about them . He silently bowed his head , and then sat down at the opposite end of the table . Burkhard wanted to place his stool again at the Duchess 's feet , as he had done the day before , when they had read Virgil ;— but Ekkehard rose and pulled him over by the hand . “ Come hither ! ” said he . The Duchess let him do as he wished .</p>
   <p>Casting first a look around her , she began thus : “ We pretended yesterday , that in our German legends and tales , there was as much , and as good matter for entertainment , as in the Roman epic of AEneas ; and I doubt not that each person amongst us , knows something of heroic battles , and besieged fortresses ; of the separation of faithful lovers , and the dissensions of mighty kings . The human heart is differently disposed , so that that , which does not interest the one , may please the other . Therefore we have made the arrangement , that each of our faithful subjects , as the lot will decide , shall relate some graceful tale ; and it will be our task then , to allot a prize for the best story . If one of you men should be the conqueror , he shall have the ancient drinking-horn , which , from the time of King Dagobert , has been hanging in the great hall ; and if my faithful Praxedis should be the victorious one , some pretty trinket is to be her reward . The pulling of straws shall decide who is to begin . ”</p>
   <p>Praxedis had prepared four bits of straw of different lengths , which she handed to the Duchess .</p>
   <p>“ Shall I add another for the young verse-maker ? ” asked she .</p>
   <p>But Burkhard said in a doleful voice : “ I beseech you to spare me ; for , if my teacher at St. Gall were to hear , that I had again diverted myself with idle tales , I should certainly be punished as I was when we acted the story of the old Hildebrand and his son Hadubrand , in Romeias ’ room . The gate-keeper , always delighted in it , and it was he who made our wooden horses and shields , with his own hands . I was the son Hadubrand , and my fellow-pupil Notker acted old Hildebrand ; his underlip being as big as that of an old man . Ho , did n't we fly at each other , so that a cloud of dust flew out of Romeias 's windows ! Notker had already unfastened his arm-ring , holding it out to me , as the old song describes it , and I was just saying : ‘ Hoho thou old blade ! Thou art really too cunning by half . Dost thou think to beguile we with thy words , and then , to throw thy spear at me ? Has thy head become hoary , with treachery and lies ? Seafaring men in the west , on the Wendel lake told me : he was killed in the wars , was Hildebrand the son of Heribrand ! ’ when Master Ratolt , our teacher of rhetoric , came upstairs on tip-toe , and belaboured us so fiercely with his large rod , that sword and shield fell from our hands .</p>
   <p>“ Romeias , was called a stupid old blockhead , for decoying us from useful studies , and my friend Notker and myself were locked up for three days , fed on bread and water , and had to make a hundred and fifty Latin hexametres in honour of St. Othmar , as a punishment . ”</p>
   <p>The Duchess smiled . “ God forbid , that we should tempt thee again to such a sin , ” said she .</p>
   <p>She put the four straws into her right hand , and smilingly held them out , for them to draw . Ekkehard 's eyes were fixed immovably on the rose under her head-band , as he stepped up to her . She had to speak to him twice , before he pulled out a straw .</p>
   <p>“ Death and damnation ! ” Master Spazzo almost ejaculated , for he had got hold of the shortest straw . But he well knew that no excuse would be available , and dolefully looked down into the valley , as if he expected help to come from thence . Praxedis had tuned her lute and was playing a prelude , that blended sweetly with the rustling of the branches in the old maple-tree .</p>
   <p>“ Our chamberlain has to fear no punishment , if he will relate us some pretty story , ” said the Duchess . “ Please to begin . ”</p>
   <p>Then , Master Spazzo bent his head forwards , put his sword with its broad hilt before him , so that he could lean on it , gave a preliminary stroke to his beard , and thus began :</p>
   <p>“ Although I never took much delight in old stories , preferring to hear the clashing of two good swords , or the tapping of a tun of good wine , I yet once chanced to come across a fine legend . In my younger days I had to make a journey to Italy , and my road then took me through the Tyrol and over the Brenner mountain ; and it was a rough and stony path , leading me over many a rock , and through many a wild glen , so that my horse lost one of its shoes . When the evening set in , I had reached a little village , called Gothensass , or Gloggensachsen , which from the times of Sir Dietrich of Bern , has lain there , hidden amongst the larch-woods . At the outskirts of this village , and built against the mountain , there was a house , much resembling a stronghold , before which , there lay heaps of iron dross , whilst inside there was a big fire , and someone who was lustily pounding the anvil .</p>
   <p>“ So , I called to the blacksmith to come forth and shoe my horse , and when nobody came , I gave a knock at the door with the butt-end of my lance , so that it flew open as wide as it could , whilst I gave vent to some tremendous curse , of death and murder and all possible evils . Suddenly , a man stood before me , with shaggy hair and a leathern apron , and scarcely had I set eyes on him , when my lance was already beaten down , so that it broke to pieces as if it had been mere glass , whilst an iron bar , was swung threateningly over my head . On the man 's naked arms , there were to be seen sinews , which looked as if he could strike an anvil ten fathom deep into the ground . Then , I bethought myself , that under such circumstances a polite speech might not come amiss , and therefore I said : I merely wanted to beseech you , to shoe my horse . Then the blacksmith drove the iron bar into the ground and said : ‘ That sounds somewhat different and will help you . Rudeness , however , will attain nothing at Weland 's forge . That 's what you may tell the people where you come from . ’</p>
   <p>“ After this speech he shod my horse , and I saw that he was a skilful and honourable blacksmith , and so we became very good friends , and I let my horse be put into his stables , and remained his guest for the night . And we caroused together till late and the wine was called Terlaner , and he poured it out of a leathern bottle .</p>
   <p>“ Whilst we were thus drinking , I questioned my sooty host about the name of his forge , and how it had got that name ; upon which he struck up a loud laugh , and then told me the story of ‘ Smith Weland . ’ And if it was not exactly what you might call very refined , it was for all that a very pretty tale . ”</p>
   <p>Master Spazzo stopped a while , throwing a look at the table , like one who looks about for a draught of wine , to moisten his dry lips with . But wine there was none , and the look was not understood . So he continued .</p>
   <p>“ Whence smith Weland had come , said the man of Gothensass to me , had never been quite ascertained . It was said , that in the northern seas , in the land of Schonen , the giant Vade was his father , and that his grandmother was a mermaid , who , when he was born , came up from the depth of the sea , and sat a whole night on a rock and harped : ‘ young Weland , must become a blacksmith . ’ So , in the course of time , Vade brought the boy to Mimer , the famous armourer , who lived in a dark fir-wood , twenty miles behind Toledo , and who instructed him in all the branches of his art .</p>
   <p>“ As soon , however , as he had made his first sword , Mimer advised him to go away , and to acquire the last finishing touch in his craft , amongst the dwarfs . So , Weland went to the dwarfs and became much renowned .</p>
   <p>“ One day , however , the giants invaded dwarf-land , so that Weland had to fly , and he could take nothing away with him , except his broad sword Mimung . This , he buckled across his back ; and chance then brought him to the Tirol . Between the Eisach , Etsch and Inn , there reigned in those days King Elberich , who kindly received Weland and gave him the forge in the wood on the Brenner-mountain , and all the iron and ore which was hidden in the mountain 's veins , was put at his disposal . And Weland 's heart became light and happy , in the Tyrolese Alps . The mountain-torrents rushed past him , setting his wheels a going ; the winds fanned his fire into brighter flames , and the stars said to each other : ‘ we must do our best , or the sparks which Weland produces will outshine us . ’ Thus Weland 's work prospered . Shield and swords , knives and drinking-cups , as well as all the ornaments which adorn a king 's palace , were made by his dexterous hands , and there was no smith , as far as the sun shone on Alpine snow , who could compare with him . King Elberich , however , had many bitter enemies , who one day formed an alliance , with the one-eyed Aemilius for their leader , and invaded the land . And Elberich 's heart was filled with dismay , and he said : ‘ He , who will bring me Aemilius 's head , shall marry my only daughter . ’ Then , Weland extinguished the fire in his forge , buckled on his broad sword Mimung , and went out to fight King Elberich 's enemies . And his good sword cut off Aemilius 's head , so that the whole body of enemies turned round and fled homewards , as fast as ever they could . Weland , however , presented the head to the King . But he said angrily : ‘ what I have said about my daughter , the winds have scattered ; a smith can never become my son-in-law , for he would blacken my hands , when I extended them for a friendly greeting . But thou shalt have three golden coins as a reward . With these , a man can tilt and joust , dance and make merry , and buy himself a wench in the market . ’ Weland , however , threw the three golden coins at his feet , so that they rolled under the throne , and said : ‘ May God bless you ; you will never see me more ! ’ and with this he turned round , to leave the land . But the king , not wanting to lose the smith , had him thrown to the ground , and his tendons cut , so that he became lame , and had to give up all thoughts of flight .</p>
   <p>“ Then , Weland , dragged himself in sadness home to his forge , and relighted his fire ; but he whistled and sang no more , when he wielded the heavy hammer and his mind was embittered . One day , the king 's son , a red-cheeked boy , who had run out alone into the wood , came in and said : ‘ Weland , I want to look at thy work . ’ Then the smith artfully replied : ‘ Place thyself close to the anvil ; there thou wilt see everything best , ’ — and he took the red-hot iron bar out of the flames , and stabbed the king 's son , right into the heart with it . The bones he afterwards bleached , and covered with ore and silver , so that they became pillars for candlesticks , and the skull he encircled with gold , making it into a drinking cup . All this , Weland sent to Elberich , and when the messengers came to inquire for the boy , he said : ‘ I have not seen him ; he must have run out into the woods . ’</p>
   <p>“ Some time afterwards , the King 's daughter was walking in her garden . She was so beautiful that the lilies bowed their heads before her . On her forefinger she wore a ring of gold , shaped like a serpent , in the head of which there glistened a carbuncle , which Elberich had set there himself ; and he held this ring far dearer than a kingdom , and had given it to his daughter only , because he loved her above everything . As she was culling a rose , the ring fell from the maiden 's finger , and rolling over the stones it got broken , and the carbuncle fell out of its golden setting , so that the maid lamented bitterly , wringing her hands , and would not go home for fear of her father 's anger .</p>
   <p>“ Then , one of her waiting-women said to her : ‘ You must go secretly to smith Weland , and he will mend it for you . ’ So the king 's daughter entered Weland 's forge , and told him her grief . He took the ring out of her hand , and set about repairing it , so that the carbuncle soon shone out again from the serpent 's head . But all this while , Weland 's forehead had been wearing a dark frown , and when the maiden kindly smiled at him , and turned to go , he said : ‘ Oho , you shall not go away yet ! ’ And he locked the strong door , and seizing the king 's daughter with strong arms , he carried her into his chamber , where moss and fern-leaves lay heaped up . And when she went away she wept aloud , and tore her soft , silken hair ... ”</p>
   <p>Here , Master Spazzo was interrupted by a slight noise . Praxedis , with a deep blush overspreading her features , had cast an inquiring look at the Duchess , to see whether she should not jump up , to close Master Spazzo 's mouth , but as nothing of the kind was to be read in her calm , set features , she impatiently drummed with her fingers on the back of her lute .</p>
   <p>“ ... and a deed of violence had been done , ” Master Spazzo continued , quite unabashed . “ Then , Weland began singing and shouting , in such a manner as had never been heard in the forge before , ever since his tendons had been cut . Leaving his shields and swords unfinished , he now worked day and night , and forged for himself a pair of large metal wings , and he had hardly finished them , when King Elberich came down the Brenner mountain , with a strong body of armed men . Then , Weland quickly fastened the wings to his shoulders , and hung his sword Mimung , over his back , and thus equipped he mounted the roof of his house , so that the men exclaimed : ‘ Behold , smith Weland has become a bird ! ’ With a powerful voice he then called out : ‘ May God bless you , King Elberich ! You will not forget the smith so easily , I trow ! Your son I have slain , and your daughter is with child , by me . Farewell , and give her my greetings ! ’ After this , he spread out his huge wings , making a noise like a hurricane , and flew through the air . The King seized his bow , and all the knights hastily followed his example . Like an army of flying dragons , the arrows whizzed round his head ; but not one of them hit him , and he flew home to his father 's castle in Schonen , and never was seen again . And Elberich never gave Weland 's message to his daughter , who in that same year gave birth to a son , who was called Wittich , and became a strong hero like his father .</p>
   <p>“ That is the story of smith Weland ! ”</p>
   <p>Master Spazzo leaned back , heaving a deep sigh of relief . “ They will not trouble me a second time for a story , I warrant , ” thought he . The impression which the story had made on the hearers was very different . The Duchess , expressed herself well satisfied with it . She had some sympathy with the smith 's revenge , whilst Praxedis angrily said that it was truly a sooty smith 's story , and that the chamberlain ought to be ashamed to show himself before women ! Ekkehard said : “ I do n't know , but it seems to me as if I had once heard something like it , but then , the king 's name was Nidung , and the forge was at the foot of the Caucasus . ”</p>
   <p>Then the chamberlain called out angrily : “ If you prefer the Caucasus to Gloggensachsen , very well , then you may lay the scene there , but I well recollect how my Tyrolese friend showed me the very spot itself . Over the chamber door , there was a broken rose of metal , and an iron eagle 's wing , and below it the words , ‘ here the smith flew away , ’ were engraved . Now and then , people come there to pray , as they believe Weland to have been a great saint . ”</p>
   <p>“ Let us see who will be the first to try and outrival Master Spazzo , ” said the Duchess , once more mixing the straws . They drew accordingly , and the shortest , this time , remained with Praxedis . She neither appeared embarrassed , nor did she appeal to the indulgence of her listeners . Passing her white little hand over her dark tresses she began thus :</p>
   <p>“ It is true , that my nurses never sang me any lullabies of valiant knights , and thank God , I have never been in a lonely forge in a wood ; but even in Constantinople you may hear such tales recited . At the time when I was instructed at the Emperor 's court , in all the arts well becoming a serving maiden , there was also an old woman who kept the keys , by name Glycerium , who often said to us : ‘ Listen ye maidens all , if you should ever serve a princess whose heart is consumed by a secret passion , and who cannot see him whom she loves , then , you must be sly and thoughtful like the waiting-woman Herlindis , when King Rother wooed the daughter of the Emperor Constantine . ’ And when we were sitting together of an evening in the women 's apartment , then , they whispered and chattered , until old Glycerium , related the story of King Rother .</p>
   <p>“ In the olden times there was an Emperor , also called Constantine , living in his castle on the Bosporus , who had a wondrously beautiful daughter ; and people said of her that she was radiant like the evening-star and outshone all other maids like a golden thread amongst silken ones . One fine day there arrived a great ship , out of which landed twelve counts and twelve knights , and they all rode into Constantine 's courtyard ; one of them , whose name was Lupolt , riding at their head . And all the people of the city marvelled at them , for their garments and mantles were heavy with gold and precious stones , and the horses ’ saddles rang with little golden bells . These were the messengers of King Rother of Vikingland , and Lupolt jumped down from his saddle , and spoke thus to the Emperor :</p>
   <p>“ ‘ We are sent out by our king , called Rother , who is the handsomest man , ever born of woman . He is served by the best of heroes , and his court is the constant scene of balls and tournaments and all that heart can desire . But as yet he is unmarried , and his heart feels lonely .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ You should give him your daughter ! ’</p>
   <p>“ Now , Constantine was a hot-tempered man , and throwing the imperial globe fiercely to the ground , he cried : ‘ Nobody has as yet wooed my daughter , who has not lost his head in the endeavour . How do you dare to insult me in that way ? You are all my prisoners . ’</p>
   <p>“ And he had them thrown into a dungeon , into which neither sun nor moon could shine ; and they had nothing but bread and water to live on ; and there they shed many bitter tears of sorrow .</p>
   <p>“ When the tidings reached King Rother , his heart was filled with sadness , and he sat on a rock all alone , and would speak to nobody . Then , he formed the resolution of crossing the seas , like a true knight , to succour his faithful messengers ; and as he had been warned against the Greeks , and had been told that if a man wanted to attain anything there , he must needs paint and gild truth , he made his knights take an oath , that they would all pretend , that his name was not Rother but Dietrich , and that he had been banished by King Rother , and had come to crave the Greek Emperor 's assistance . Thus , they set out in a ship , and Rother took his harp on board with him , for before his twelve ambassadors had weighed anchor , he came to the shore with his harp and played three airs , which they were to remember , saying : ‘ If ever you should be in distress , and hear these airs , you will know that Rother is near and will help you . ’</p>
   <p>“ It was on Easter-day and the Emperor Constantine had gone on horseback to Hippodrom , when Rother made his entrance . And all the citizens of Constantinople ran out of their houses , for such a sight they had never seen before . Rother had brought his giants along with him . The first was called Asprian , and carried an iron bar which measured six yards in length ; the second was called Widolt and was so fierce that they had loaded him with chains , and the third was called Eveningred .</p>
   <p>“ Besides these , a large member of valiant knights followed him , and twelve carriages loaded with jewels came in the rear , and the whole was such a splendid spectacle , that the Empress said : ‘ Alas , how stupid we have been , in refusing our daughter to King Rother ! What a man he must be , to send such an army of heroes over the seas ! ’</p>
   <p>“ King Rother himself , wore a gold breast-plate , and a purple coat , and two rows of beautiful rings on his wrists . And he bent his knee before the Greek Emperor and said : ‘ I , the Prince Dietrich have been outlawed by a king whose name is Rother , so that all I have ever done in his service , now tells against me . I have come to offer my services to you . ’</p>
   <p>“ Then , Constantine invited all the heroes to his court at Hippodrom , and treating them with all honour , he made them sit down at his own table . Now , in the hall there was a tame lion , which used to take away the serving-men 's food . It also came to Asprian 's plate , to lick it up , upon which the giant seized it by the mane , and threw it against the wall , that it was killed on the spot . Then the chamberlains said to each other : ‘ He who has no desire to be thrown against the wall , had best leave that man 's plate alone . ’</p>
   <p>“ King Rother then began to distribute a great many handsome presents amongst the Greeks . Everyone who visited him in his temporary abode received either a mantle or some piece of arms . Amongst others there also came an outlawed count , to whom he gave a thousand silver crowns , and took him into his service , so that his train was increased by many hundred knights .</p>
   <p>“ Thus , the so-called Dietrich 's praise was in the mouth of everybody , and amongst the women there began a whispering and talking , so that there was not a chamber whose walls did not ring with Sir Dietrich 's name .</p>
   <p>“ Then , the goldenhaired daughter of the Emperor said to Herlindis , her waiting-woman : ‘ Alas , what shall I do , that I also may obtain a look at the man whom they all renown so ? ’ And Herlindis replied : ‘ The best thing would be if you begged your father , to give a great banquet , and to invite the stranger guests ; then you could easily see him . ’</p>
   <p>“ The Emperor 's daughter followed this advice , and Constantine did not say her nay , and he invited all his dukes and counts as well as the foreign heroes . All who were invited came ; and around him , whom they called Dietrich , there was a great crowd , and just when the princess with her hundred court-ladies came in , with the golden crown on her head , and her gold-embroidered purple mantle , there was a great noise , which was occasioned by a chamberlain 's having ordered Asprian the giant , to move on his bench , to make room for other people . For all reply , Asprian gave the chamberlain a box on the ear which split his head , and there ensued a general jostling , so that Dietrich had to restore order himself .</p>
   <p>“ For this reason , the Emperor 's daughter could not obtain the desired glimpse of the hero ; though she wanted it ever so much .</p>
   <p>“ When she had returned home , she said to Herlindis : ‘ Woe is me ! I shall neither have rest now by night nor by day , until my eyes have beheld that valiant man . He , who would bring me the hero to my chamber , might win a handsome reward . ’ And Herlindis replied laughingly : ‘ That message I will faithfully undertake . I will go to the house where he lives . ’</p>
   <p>“ Then , the sly maiden put on her most becoming garments , and went out to Sir Dietrich , who received her with due courtesy . And she sat down beside him , and whispered into his ear : ‘ My mistress , the Emperor 's daughter , sends you many gracious greetings . She has taken a great fancy to you , and wishes you to pay her a visit . ’</p>
   <p>“ But Dietrich replied : ‘ woman , thou art not doing right . I have entered many a bower , in days gone by ; why dost thou mock the homeless wanderer ? At the Emperor 's court there are noble dukes and princes enough , and thy mistress never dreamt of what thou art now saying ! ’</p>
   <p>“ And when Herlindis insisted on the truth of her words , Sir Dietrich said : ‘ There are so many spies about here , that he , who wishes to keep his reputation unstained , must be very careful . Constantinus would banish me , if he found out that I had been to see his daughter . Please to tell her this ; though I should much like to serve her . ’</p>
   <p>“ Herlindis , was rising to go , when the King ordered his goldsmiths to make a pair of golden shoes , and another pair of silver , and he gave her one of each pair , as well as a mantle and twelve bracelets ; for he was a gallant man and knew that a princess 's waiting-woman , entrusted with such delicate matters , ought to be much honoured . ” ...</p>
   <p>Praxedis here stopped a moment , for Master Spazzo who had begun drawing a number of big-nosed faces on the sand , with the scabbard of his sword , now hummed audibly , but as he did not say anything she continued .</p>
   <p>“ And Herlindis returned home full of glee , and spoke thus to her mistress : ‘ the valiant knight holds his honour dear . He values the Emperor 's good will too much to comply with your wishes . But look here , what he gave me ! The shoes , the bracelets and the mantle ! How glad I am that I went there ; for surely I shall never behold a handsomer knight in this wide world . God pardon me , but I stared at him as if he were an angel ! ’</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Alas ! ’ said the princess , ‘ am I never to be made happy ? Then , at least thou must give me the shoes which the noble hero gave to thee . I will give thee their weight in gold . ’</p>
   <p>“ Thus , the bargain was concluded . First she put on the golden shoe , but when she took up the silver one , she perceived that it was made for the same foot . ‘ Woe is me ! ’ cried the beautiful maiden . ‘ Thou hast made a mistake , and I shall never get it on . Thou must go once more to Sir Dietrich , and beg him to give thee the other shoe , and also that he should come himself . ’</p>
   <p>“ ‘ That will delight all scandal-loving tongues , ’ laughed Herlindis , ‘ but what does it matter ? I will go ! ’ — and she drew up her skirts almost to her knees , and walked over the wet courtyard to Sir Dietrich , and the noble hero saw her coming , and he well knew what she wanted . Still , he feigned not to see her .</p>
   <p>“ But Herlindis accosted him thus : ‘ You see that I had to come again . A mistake has been made ; so my mistress bids me ask you , to give me the other shoe , and to accompany me yourself . ’</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Verily I should much like to go , ’ said he , ‘ but the Emperor 's chamberlains would betray me . ’</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Never fear that , ’ said Herlindis , ‘ for they are all out , practising the throwing of the spear . Take two servant-men with you , and follow me softly , and nobody will miss you during the tournament . ’</p>
   <p>“ After this , the faithful maiden wanted to go , but the hero detained her , saying : ‘ I will first inquire after the shoes . ’ Then Asprian , who was outside called out : ‘ What matters an old shoe ? We have made many thousands of them , and the servants are now wearing them . I will look for the right one . ’ So he brought it , and Dietrich again gave a mantle and twelve bracelets to the waiting-woman .</p>
   <p>“ So she went on before , and imparted the desired news to her mistress .</p>
   <p>“ Sir Dietrich meanwhile , caused a great uproar to be made in the courtyard at Hippodrom . Widolt came out first with his iron bar , and raved like a madman . Asprian cut a summersault in the air , and Eveningred threw an immense stone of several hundred weight a long distance , and then sprang after it , so that none of the spies thought of watching Sir Dietrich , as he steadily walked across the yard .</p>
   <p>“ At the window stood the princess , looking out and her heart beat fast , when she saw him approach . Her chamber-door was then opened to him and she addressed him thus : ‘ Welcome , my noble lord ! Great pleasure does it give me , to see you . Now you can put the beautiful shoes on my feet yourself . ’</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Gladly I will do so , ’ said the hero , sitting down at her feet ; and his manners were graceful and elegant . So she put her foot on his knee , and the foot was dainty and the shoes fitted well . So Sir Dietrich put them on for her .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Please to tell me , noble and gracious lady , ’ the artful man now began , ‘ thou hast probably been wooed by many a man ; now confess , which of them has pleased thee most ? ’</p>
   <p>“ Then the Emperor 's daughter replied with a serious mien . ‘ Sir , by the purity of my soul , and by my holy baptism ! If all the heroes of the world were brought together , not one of them would be found worthy to be called thy equal . Thou art a virtuous and noble man ,— yet if I could choose freely , I would take a hero , of whom I cannot help thinking day and night . The messengers whom he has sent to woo me , have been thrown into a deep , dreary dungeon . His name is Rother ; he lives across the seas , and if he will not become my own , I shall remain a maid all the days of my life ! ’</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Heigho ! ’ said Dietrich , ‘ if thou wilt wed with Rother , I will bring him hither quickly . We have lived pleasantly together as friends , and he has ever been kind and good to me , although he drove me away from his lands . ’</p>
   <p>“ Then the princess replied : ‘ How canst thou love a man , who has banished thee ?— Ah , now I see it all ! Thou art a messenger , sent by King Rother . And now speak out forthwith , and hide nothing from me , for what thou wilt now tell me , I will keep secret until the day of judgment . ’</p>
   <p>“ When she had thus spoken , the hero looked steadily at her and said ! ‘ Then I will put my trust in God and leave my fate in thy hands . Know then , that thy feet are resting on King Rother 's knees ! ’</p>
   <p>“ Great was the terror of the gentle maiden . Hastily drawing away her feet , she cried : ‘ Woe is me ! how could I be so ill-bred and thoughtless , as to place my foot on thy lap ! If God had really sent thee hither , I should be deeply thankful . But how can I trust thee ? If thou couldst prove to me the truth of what thou hast told me , I would gladly quit my father 's realms with thee , even to-day . There is not a man living whom I would take but thee , if thou wert really King Rother ,— but for the present this must remain undone . ’</p>
   <p>“ ‘ How could I prove it better , than through my imprisoned friends ? ’ said the King . ‘ If they could see me , thou wouldst soon be convinced that I have spoken truth . ’</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Then I will beg my father to let them out , ’ said the princess . ‘ But who will prevent their escape ? ’</p>
   <p>“ ‘ I will look to that , ’ replied he .</p>
   <p>“ Then , the Emperor 's daughter kissed the hero , and he left her chamber in all honour , and returned to his house , his heart full of deep joy .</p>
   <p>“ At the first dawn of the next day , the princess took a staff and put on a black mourning dress , with the pilgrim 's badge on her shoulders , as if she wanted to leave the land , and her face was very pale and sad . Thus , she knocked at the Emperor 's door and artfully said : ‘ My dear father ! Though still alive , I am yet suffering great torments . I feel very miserable , and who will comfort me ? In my dreams , the imprisoned messengers of King Rother have appeared to me , and they look pale and worn , and leave me no peace . So I must go to escape from them , if you will not at least let me comfort the miserable men , with good food , wine and a bath . Let them come out of their prison , if it were only for three days . ’</p>
   <p>“ Then the Emperor made answer . ‘ This will I grant thee , if thou wilt find me security , that they return to their prison on the third day . ’</p>
   <p>“ At the usual hour for supper , the so-called Sir Dietrich with his knights also came to the Emperor 's hall , and when the repast was over , and everyone was washing his hands , the princess walked round the tables , as if she wanted to choose someone among the number of rich dukes and noble lords , who would stand bail . When she came to Dietrich she said : ‘ Now it is time that thou shouldst help me . Stand bail for thy messengers with thy life . ’</p>
   <p>“ Then he replied : ‘ I will be surety , most beautiful maiden . ’ And he pledged his head to the Emperor , who sent out some men to open the prison-gate . The wretched messengers were by this time reduced to a state of great weakness . When the doors were opened , the clear daylight shone in , and dazzled the unfortunate men , who had grown unused to it . Then they took the twelve counts , and made them go out . Each one was followed by a knight . They could scarcely walk . Lupolt their leader , again walked at their head . He wore a torn apron round his loins ; his beard was long and shaggy , and his body was covered with sores . Sir Dietrich was overwhelmed with sadness , and he turned his head away , that they might not recognize him ; and he could scarcely repress the rising tears , which the pitiful sight called forth . He then had them all brought to his house , where everything was got ready for their reception , and the counts said to each other , ‘ who was he , who stood aside ? He is surely befriending us . ’ And they , with their hearts full of old grief , laughed with a new joy ; but they did not recognize him .</p>
   <p>“ On the following day , the Emperor 's daughter invited the sorely-tried men to court , presented them with good , new garments , ordered a warm bath to be prepared for them , and had a table spread for a sumptuous repast . As soon as the noblemen were seated around it , forgetting their woe for a moment , Sir Dietrich took his harp , and hiding himself behind a curtain , touched the strings and played one of the melodies which he had before played on the seashore .</p>
   <p>“ Lupolt , who had raised the cup to his lips , let it fall , so that the wine was all spilt over the table ; and another who was cutting bread , dropped his knife , and all listened wondering . Louder and clearer their king 's song was heard , and then Lupolt jumped across the table , and all the counts and knights followed him , as if something of their old strength had suddenly returned , and they tore down the curtain , and kissed the harper , and knelt before him , and the joy was indescribable .</p>
   <p>“ Then , the princess knew that he was really and truly King Rother of Vikingland , and she uttered a loud cry of delight , which attracted her Father Constantine thitherwards ; and whether he liked it or not , he could do nothing but join the lover 's hands . The messengers never went back to their dungeon ; Rother was no longer called Dietrich , and he kissed his bride and took her home over the seas , and became a very happy man , holding his wife in great honour . And whenever they sat lovingly together , they would say : ‘ Thanks be to God , to knightly valour , and prudent waiting-woman 's cunning . ’</p>
   <p>“ That is the story of King Rother ! ”</p>
   <p>Praxedis had spoken a long while .</p>
   <p>“ We are well satisfied , ” said the Duchess , “ and whether smith Weland will carry off the prize , after King Rother 's history has been told , seems to me rather doubtful . ”</p>
   <p>Master Spazzo was not annoyed at this .</p>
   <p>“ The waiting-women at Constantinople , seem to have eaten wisdom with spoons , ” said he . “ But although I may be conquered , the last tale has not yet been told . ” He glanced over at Ekkehard who was sitting lost in thought . He had not heard much of King Rother . All the time that Praxedis had been speaking , his eyes had been fixed on the Duchess 's headband with the rose in it .</p>
   <p>“ To say the truth , ” continued Master Spazzo , “ I hardly believe the story . Some years ago , when I was sitting in the bishop 's courtyard at Constance , drinking a jug of wine , a Greek pedlar , trafficking with relics , came that way . His name was Daniel , and he had many holy bones and church-ornaments , and the like articles , amongst which there was also an ancient sword , with jewel-set hilt , which he tried to foist on me , saying , that it was the sword of King Rother , and if the gold crowns had not then been as scanty with me , as the hairs on the pedlar 's pate , I should have bought it . The man told me that Sir Rother had fought for the Emperor 's daughter with that very same sword , with King Ymelot of Babylon , but of golden shoes , waiting-women or harp-playing , he knew nothing whatever . ”</p>
   <p>“ I dare say that many things might still be found in this world , which you know nothing about , ” lightly said Praxedis .</p>
   <p>The evening had set in . The moon had risen , shedding her pale light over hills and plain . Strong fragrant perfumes filled the air , and the fireflies were getting ready for flight , in the bushes and crevices of the rocks round about .</p>
   <p>A servant came down with some lights , which , being surrounded by linen , saturated with oil , burned brightly and steadily . The air was mild and pleasant .</p>
   <p>Burkhard the cloister-pupil , was still sitting contentedly on his stool ; his hands folded as in devotion .</p>
   <p>“ What does our young guest think ? ” asked the Duchess .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ Thou shouldst become a knight , and go out to conquer giants and</l>

     <l n="5">This , however , did not convince him . “ But we have to fight the Devil</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Dame Hadwig was not yet inclined to go indoors . Breaking a twig from the maple-tree into two unequal pieces , she stepped up to Ekkehard . He started up confusedly .</p>
   <p>“ Well , ” said the Duchess , “ you must draw . Either you or I ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Either you or I , ” vacantly repeated Ekkehard . He drew out the shorter piece . It slipped out of his hand , whilst he silently resumed his seat .</p>
   <p>“ Ekkehard ! ” sharply exclaimed the Duchess .</p>
   <p>He looked up .</p>
   <p>“ You are to relate something ! ”</p>
   <p>“ I am to relate something , ” murmured he , passing his right hand over his forehead . It was burning and inside it , was a storm .</p>
   <p>“ Ah yes — relate something . Who is going to play the lute for me ? ”</p>
   <p>He stood up and gazed out into the moonlit night , whilst the others looked at him in mute wonder , and then he began in a strange , hollow voice :</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Tis a short story . There once was a light , which shone brightly , and it shone down from a hill , and it was more radiant and glorious than the rainbow . And it wore a rose under the headband ... ”</p>
   <p>“ A rose under the headband ? ” muttered Master Spazzo , shaking his head .</p>
   <p>“ ... And there was once a dusky moth , ” continued Ekkehard , still in the same tone , “ which flew up to the hill , and which knew that it must perish if it flew into the light .— And it did fly in all the same , and the light burned the dark moth , so that it became mere ashes ,— and never flew any more . Amen ! ”</p>
   <p>Dame Hadwig sprang up , indignantly .</p>
   <p>“ Is that the whole of your story ? ” asked she .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Tis the whole of it , ” replied he with unchanged voice .</p>
   <p>“ It is time , for us to go in , ” proudly said the Duchess . “ The cool night-air produces fever . ”</p>
   <p>She walked past Ekkehard with a disdainful look . Burkhard again carried her train , whilst Ekkehard stood there immovably .</p>
   <p>The chamberlain patted , him on the shoulder . “ The dark moth was a poor fool , Master Chaplain ! ” said he compassionately .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">A sudden gust of wind , here put out the lights . “ It was a monk , ” said</l>
     <l n="2">Ekkehard indifferently , “ sleep well ! ”</l>

    <head>CHAPTER XXI .</head>
     <l n="1">Rejection and Flight .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Ekkehard had remained sitting in the bower for a long time after the others had gone away , and when at last he also rose , he rushed out into the darkness . He did not know whither his feet were carrying him . In the morning he found himself on the top of the Hohenkraehen , which was silent and deserted since the woman of the wood had left it . The remains of the burnt hut , formed now but a confused mass . On the place where the sitting-room had once been , was still the Roman stone with the Mithras . Grass and ferns were growing on it , and a slow-worm was stealthily creeping up on the old weatherbeaten idol .</p>
   <p>Ekkehard burst into a wild laugh . “ The chapel of St. Hadwig ! ” he cried , striking his breast , with his clenched hand . “ Thus , it must be ! ” He upset the old Roman stone , and then mounted the rock on the top of the hill . There , he threw himself down , pressing his forehead against the cool ground , which had once been touched by Dame Hadwig 's foot . Thus , he remained for a long time . When the scorching rays of the mid-day sun were falling vertically down , he still lay there , and — slept .</p>
   <p>Towards the evening he came back to the Hohentwiel , looking hot and excited , and having an unsteady gait . Blades of grass clung to the woolen texture of his habit .</p>
   <p>The inhabitants of the castle , shyly stepped out of his way , as if ill-luck had set her seal on his forehead . In other times they used to come towards him , to entreat his blessing .</p>
   <p>The Duchess had noticed his absence , without making any inquiries about him . He went up to his tower , and seized a parchment , as if he would read . It happened to be Gunzo 's libel . “ Willingly I would ask you , to try the effect of healing medicine , but I fear that his illness is too deeply rooted , ” was what he read . He laughed . The arched ceiling threw back an echo , which made him jump up , as if he wanted to find out who had laughed at him . Then , he stepped up to the window , and looked down into the depth below . It was deep , far deeper than he had imagined , and overcome by a sudden giddiness , he started back .</p>
   <p>His eye now fell on the small phial which the old Thieto had given him . With a painful recollection he thought of the blind old man ! “ Serving women is an evil thing for him , who wishes to remain in the paths of virtue , ” he had said when Ekkehard took leave .</p>
   <p>He tore the seal off and poured the water from the Jordan over his head and eyes . It was too late . Whole floods of holy water will not extinguish the inward fire , unless one dives down , never to rise again to the surface . Yet a momentary feeling of quiet came over him .</p>
   <p>“ I will pray to be delivered from temptation , ” said he . He threw himself on his knees , but after a while he fancied that he heard the pigeons swarming round his head , as they did on the day when he first entered his chamber . Only they had mocking faces now , and had a contemptuous look about their beaks .</p>
   <p>He got up , and slowly descended the winding staircase to the castle-chapel . The altar , which had often witnessed his former earnest devotions , was a safer place for him , he thought . The chapel was as it had always been , dark and silent . Six ponderous pillars with square capitals adorned with leaf-work , supported the vault . A faint streak of daylight fell in through the narrow window . The depth of the niche in which the altar was placed , was but faintly illuminated ; the golden background of the mosaic picture of the Redeemer alone shone with a soft glitter . Greek artists had transplanted the forms of their church ornaments to the German rock . In white flowing garments , with a golden red aureole round his head , the Saviour 's lean figure stood there , with the fingers of the right hand extended in the act of blessing .</p>
   <p>Ekkehard knelt before the altar-steps ; his forehead resting on the cold stone flags . Thus he remained , wrapt in prayer . “ Oh thou , that hast taken the sins and sufferings of the whole world on thyself , send out one ray of thy grace on me , unworthy object . ” He looked up with a fixed stare as if he expected the earnest figure to step down , and hold out his hand to him .</p>
   <p>“ I am here at thy feet , like Peter , surrounded by tempest , and the waves will not bear me up ! Save me , oh Lord ! save me as thou didst him , when thou walkedst over the raging billows , extending thy hand to him and saying ‘ oh , thou of little faith , wherefore dost thou doubt ? ’ ”</p>
   <p>But no such sign was given him .</p>
   <p>Ekkehard 's brain was giving way .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">A rustling , like that of a woman 's garments , now became audible , but</l>
     <l n="2">Ekkehard did not hear it .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Dame Hadwig had come down , impelled by a strange impulse . Since her feelings for the monk had undergone a change , the image of her late husband recurred oftener to her inward mind . This was but natural . As the one receded into the background , the other must come forward again . The latter reading of Virgil had also its share in this , as there had been said so much about the memory of Sichaeus .</p>
   <p>The following day was the anniversary of Sir Burkhard 's death . With his lance and shield by his side , the old duke lay buried in the chapel below . His tomb was covered by a rough stone-slab . A sarcophagus of grey sandstone stood near it , resting on small clumsy pillars , with ionic headpieces , which again rested on quaint ugly stone-animals . This stone coffin , Dame Hadwig had had made for herself . Every year , on the anniversary of the Duke 's death , she had it carried up , filled with corn and fruits , which were distributed amongst the poor ,— the means for living coming from the resting-place of the dead . It was an old pious custom .</p>
   <p>To-day she intended to pray on her husband 's grave . The reigning twilight concealed Ekkehard 's kneeling figure . She did not see him .</p>
   <p>Suddenly she started up from her kneeling pasture . A laugh , soft yet piercing struck her ear . She knew the voice well . Ekkehard had risen and recited the following words of the psalms :</p>
   <p>“ Hide me under the shadow of thy wings . From the wicked that oppress me , from my deadly enemies , who compass me about . Arise , o Lord , disappoint them , cast them down . ” ...</p>
   <p>He said it in an ominous tone . It was no more the voice of prayer .</p>
   <p>Dame Hadwig bent down once more , beside the sarcophagus , on which she would gladly have placed another , to hide her from Ekkehard 's view . She had no longer any wish to be alone with him . Her heart beat calmly now .</p>
   <p>He went to the door , about to go , when suddenly he looked back once more . The everlasting lamp was softly rocking to and fro , over Dame Hadwig 's head . Ekkehard 's eye pierced the twilight this time , and with one bound ,— quicker than that which in later days St. Bernard had made , when the madonna had beckoned to him , in the cathedral at Speier — he stood before the Duchess . He cast a long and penetrating look at her . Rising from the ground , and seizing the edge of the stone sarcophagus with her right hand , she confronted him , whilst the everlasting lamp over her head , was still gently swinging to and fro , on its silken cord .</p>
   <p>“ Thrice blessed are the dead , for one prays for them , ” said Ekkehard , interrupting the silence .</p>
   <p>Dame Hadwig made no reply .</p>
   <p>“ Will you pray for me also , when I am dead ? ” continued he . “ Oh no , you must not pray for me ! ... but you must let a goblet be made out of my skull , and when you take another monk away from the monastery of St. Gallus , you must offer him the welcome draught in it ,— and give him my greeting !— You can put your own lips to it also ; it will not crack . But you must then wear the head-band with the rose in it . ” ...</p>
   <p>“ Ekkehard ! ” said the Duchess , “ you are trespassing ! ”</p>
   <p>He put his right hand up to his forehead .</p>
   <p>“ Ah yes ! ” said he in a soft , mournful voice , “ ah yes !... the Rhine is trespassing also . They have stopped its course with gigantic rocks , but it has gnawed them all through , and is now rushing and roaring onwards ; carrying everything before it , in its glorious newly won liberty !... And God must be trespassing also methinks ; for he has allowed the Rhine to be , and the Hohentwiel and the Duchess of Suabia , and the tonsure on my head . ”</p>
   <p>The Duchess began to shiver . Such an outbreak of long repressed feeling , she had not expected . But , it was too late ,— her heart remained untouched .</p>
   <p>“ You are ill , ” she said .</p>
   <p>“ Ill ? ” asked he , “ it is merely a requital . More than a year ago , at Whitsuntide , when there was as yet no Hohentwiel for me , I carried the coffin of St. Gallus in solemn procession out of the cloister , and a woman threw herself on the ground before me . ‘ Get up , ’ cried I , but she remained prostrate in the dust . ‘ Walk over me with thy relic , oh priest , so that I may recover , ’ cried she , and my foot stepped over her . That woman suffered from the heartache . Now ‘ tis reversed . ” ...</p>
   <p>Tears interrupted his voice . He could not go on . Then , he threw himself at Dame Hadwig 's feet , clasping the hem of her garment . His whole frame was convulsed with trembling .</p>
   <p>Dame Hadwig was touched ; touched against her will ; as if from the hem of her garment , a feeling of unutterable woe thrilled her , up to her very heart .</p>
   <p>“ Get up , ” said she , “ and try to think of other things . You still owe us a story . You will soon have conquered this weakness . ”</p>
   <p>Then Ekkehard laughed through his tears .</p>
   <p>“ A story ! ” cried he , “ yes , a story ! But it must not be told . Come , let us act the story ! From the height of yonder tower one can see so far into the distance , and so deep into the valley below ,— so sweet and deep , and tempting . What right has the ducal castle to hold us back ? Nobody who wishes to get down into the depth below , need count more than three , ... and we should flutter and glide softly into the arms of Death , awaiting us down there . Then , I should be no longer a monk , and I might wind my arms around you ,— and he who sleeps here in the ground below , ” striking Sir Burkhard 's tombstone with his clenched hand ; “ shall not prevent me ! If he , the old man should come , I would not let you go , and we will float up to the tower again , and sit where we sat before , and we will read the AEneid to the end , and you must wear the rose under your head-band , as if nothing whatever had happened . The gate we will keep well locked against the Duke , and we will laugh at all evil backbiting tongues , and folks will say , when sitting at their fire-places of a winter 's evening : ‘ that is a pretty tale of the faithful Ekkehard , who slew the Emperor Ermenrich for hanging the Harlungen brothers , and who afterwards sat for many hundred years before Dame Venus 's mountain , with his white staff in his hands , and he meant to sit there until the day of judgment , to warn off all pilgrims coming to the mountain . But at last he grew tired of this , and ran away and became a monk at St. Gall , and he fell down an abyss and was killed , and he is sitting now beside a proud , pale woman , reading Virgil to her . And at midnight may be heard the words : ‘ If thou commandest , oh Queen , to renew the unspeakable sorrow . ’ ‘ And then she must kiss him , whether she will or not , for death makes up for the pleasures denied us in life . ’ ”</p>
   <p>He had uttered all this with a wild , wandering look in his face ; and now his voice failed with low weeping . Dame Hadwig had stood immovably all this time . It was as if a gleam of pity were lighting up her cold eye , as she now bent down her head towards him .</p>
   <p>“ Ekkehard , ” said she , “ you must not speak of death . This is madness . We both live , you and I ! ”</p>
   <p>He did not stir . Then she lightly laid her hand on his burning forehead . This touch sent a wild thrill through his brains . He sprang up .</p>
   <p>“ You are right ! ” cried he . “ We both live , you and I ! ”</p>
   <p>A dizzy darkness clouded his eyes as he stepped forwards , and winding his arms round her proud form , he fiercely pressed her to his bosom , his kiss burning on her lip . Her resisting words died away , unheard .</p>
   <p>Raising her high up towards the altar , as if she were an offering he was about to make , he cried out to the dark and solemn looking picture , “ why dost thou hold out thy gold glittering fingers so quietly , instead of blessing us ? ”</p>
   <p>The Duchess had started like a wounded deer . One moment , and all the passion of her hurt pride lent her strength , to push the frenzied man back , and to free herself at least partly from his embrace . He had still got one arm round her waist , when the church-door was suddenly opened , and a flaring streak of daylight broke through the darkness ,— they were no longer alone .</p>
   <p>Rudimann , the cellarer from the Reichenau , stepped over the threshold , whilst other figures became visible in the background of the courtyard .</p>
   <p>The Duchess had waxed pale with shame and anger . A tress of her long dark hair had become loosened and was streaming down her back .</p>
   <p>“ I beg your pardon , ” said the man from the Reichenau , with grinning politeness . “ My eyes have beheld nothing . ”</p>
   <p>Then , Dame Hadwig , ridding herself entirely from Ekkehard 's hold , cried out : “ Yes , I say !— yes you have seen a madman , who has forgotten himself and God , ... I should be sorry for your eyes if they had beheld nothing , for I would have had them torn out ! ”</p>
   <p>It was with an indescribably cold hauteur , that she pronounced these words .</p>
   <p>Then Rudimann began to understand the strange scene .</p>
   <p>“ I had forgotten , ” said he in a cutting tone , “ that the man who stands there , is one of those , to whom wise men have applied the words of St. Hieronymus , when he says , that their manners were more befitting dandies and bridegrooms , than the elect of the Lord . ”</p>
   <p>Ekkehard stood there , leaning against a pillar , with arms stretched out in the air , like Odysseus when he wanted to embrace the shadow of his mother . Rudimann 's words roused him from his dreams .</p>
   <p>“ Who dares to come between her and me ? ” cried he threateningly . But Rudimann , patting him on the shoulder with an insolent familiarity , said : “ Calm yourself , my good friend ; we have only come to deliver a note into your hands . St. Gallus can no longer allow the wisest of all his disciples , to remain out in this shilly-shallying world . You are called home !— And do n't forget the stick with which you are wont to illtreat your confraters , who like to snatch a kiss at vintage-time , you chaste censor , ” he added in a low whisper .</p>
   <p>Ekkehard stepped back . Wild longings , the pain of separation , burning passionate love , and cutting , taunting words ,— all these overwhelmed him at once . He made a few steps towards the Duchess ; but the chapel was already filling . The Abbot of Reichenau had come himself to witness Ekkehard 's departure .</p>
   <p>“ It will be a difficult task , to get him away , ” he had said to the cellarer . It was easy enough now . Monks and lay-brothers came in after him .</p>
   <p>“ Sacrilege , ” Rudimann called out to them . “ He has laid his wanton hand on his mistress , even before the altar ! ”</p>
   <p>Then Ekkehard could not restrain himself any longer . To have the most sacred secret of his heart profaned by insolent coarseness ,— a pearl thrown before swine , ... he tore down the everlasting lamp , and swung the heavy vessel over his head . The light went out , and the moment after , a hollow groan was heard , and the cellarer lay with bleeding head on the stone-flags . The lamp lay beside him . Then there followed a fierce struggle , fighting , confusion ... all was coming to an end with Ekkehard . They had got the better of him , and tearing off the cord which served him as a belt , they tied his hands together .</p>
   <p>There he stood , the handsome youthful figure ; now the very picture of woe , resembling the broken-winged eagle . His eyes sent one mournful , troubled and appealing look at the Duchess ,— who turned her head away .</p>
   <p>“ Do that which you think right , ” said she to the Abbot , sweeping proudly through the ranks of the lookers on .</p>
   <p>A cloud of smoke met her outside , whilst the voices of loud , noisy merriment were heard from the castle-gate , outside of which a great bonfire , made up of resinous pine-branches , was burning . The servants of the castle danced around it , throwing flowers into the flames , and at that moment , Audifax putting his arm round the companion of his adventures , had jumped with her through the flames , uttering a loud cry of delight .</p>
   <p>“ Where does all this smoke come from ? ” asked Dame Hadwig of Praxedis , who was coming towards her .</p>
   <p>“ Solstice ! Midsummer-day ! ” said the Greek maid .</p>
   <p>It was a dreary , uncomfortable evening . The Duchess had locked herself up in her bed-room , refusing admittance to everyone .</p>
   <p>Ekkehard meanwhile , had been dragged into a dungeon , by the order of the Abbot . In the same tower , in the airy upper storey of which was his chamber , there was a damp , dark vault , the floor of which had fragments of old tombstones lying about ; they had been brought there , when the castle-chapel had been renovated . A bundle of straw had been thrown in for him , and a monk was sitting outside to guard the entrance .</p>
   <p>Burkhard , the cloister-pupil , ran up and down , wailing and wringing his hands . He could not understand the fate which had befallen his uncle . The servants were all putting their heads together , eagerly whispering , and gossiping , as if the hundred-tongued Rumour had been sitting on the roof , spreading her falsehoods about . “ He tried to murder the Duchess , ” said one . “ He has practised the Devil 's own arts , with that big book of his , ” said another . “ To-day is St. John 's day , when the Devil has no power , and so he could not help him . ”</p>
   <p>At the well in the courtyard , Rudimann the cellarer was standing , letting the clear water flow over his head . Ekkehard had given him a sharp cut , out of which the dark blood was slowly trickling down into the water .</p>
   <p>Whilst he was thus occupied , Praxedis came down , looking pale and depressed . She was the only being who had sincere , heartfelt pity , for the prisoner . On seeing the cellarer , she ran into the garden , tore up a blue cornflower with the roots , and then bringing it to him , said : “ Take that into your right hand until it gets warm , and then the bleeding will cease . Or , shall I fetch you some linen to dress the wound ? ”</p>
   <p>The cellarer shook his head .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ It will stop , in its own time , ” said he . ‘ " Tis not the first time that</l>
     <l n="2">I have been bled . Keep your cornflowers for yourself . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But Praxedis was anxious to conciliate Ekkehard 's enemy . So she fetched some linen , upon which he allowed his wound to be dressed , without however , offering any thanks for it .</p>
   <p>“ Are you not going to let Ekkehard out to-day ? ” asked she .</p>
   <p>“ To-day ? ” Rudimann repeated sneeringly . “ Do you feel inclined to weave a garland for the standard-bearer of Antichrist ? the leading horse of Satan 's car , whom you have petted and spoiled up here , as if he were the darling son Benjamin himself ? Today indeed ! When a month is passed you may put the question again , over there , ” pointing towards the Helvetian mountains .</p>
   <p>Praxedis was frightened . “ What then do you intend to do with him ? ”</p>
   <p>“ That which is right , ” replied Rudimann with an evil laugh . “ Wantonness , deeds of violence , disobedience , haughtiness , sacrilege , blasphemy ,— there are scarcely names enough for all his nefarious acts ; but thank God , there are yet means for their expiation ! ” He made a motion with his hand like that of flogging .— “ Ah yes , plenty of means of expiation , gentle mistress ! We are going to write the catalogue of his sins on his back . ”</p>
   <p>“ Have pity , ” said Praxedis , “ for he is a sick man . ”</p>
   <p>“ For that very reason we are going to cure him . When he has been tied to the pillar for an hour or so , and half a dozen rods have been flogged to pieces on his bleeding back , then all his spleen and his devilries will vanish ! ”</p>
   <p>“ For God 's sake ! ” exclaimed the terrified girl .</p>
   <p>“ Calm yourself , for that is not all . A stray lamb must be delivered up to the fold it belongs to . There , he will find good shepherds who will look after the rest . Sheep-shearing sweet mistress , sheep-shearing ! Then they will cut off the hair of his head , which will make it a deal cooler ; and if you feel inclined to undertake a pilgrimage to St. Gall , in a year hence , you will see on Sundays and holidays , somebody standing barefooted before the church-door , and his head will be as bare as a cornfield after harvest-time , and the penitential garb will become him very nicely . What do you think ? The Heathenish goings on with Virgil are at an end now . ”</p>
   <p>“ He is innocent ! ” said Praxedis .</p>
   <p>“ Oh , ” said the cellarer sneeringly , “ we shall never harm innocence ! He need only prove himself so by God 's ordeal . If he takes the ring out of the kettle of boiling water with unburnt arm , our Abbot himself will give him the blessing ; and I will say that it was all a delusion of the Devil 's own making , when my eyes beheld the lady Duchess , clasped in the arms of his holiness , brother Ekkehard . ”</p>
   <p>Praxedis wept . “ Dear , venerable Master Rudimann ! ” said she imploringly .</p>
   <p>Throwing an ugly leer at the Greek maiden , he said with pinched lips : “ So it will be . I might however perhaps be induced to interfere on his behalf , if ... ”</p>
   <p>“ If ? ” asked Praxedis eagerly .</p>
   <p>“ If you would be pleased to leave your chamber-door open to-night , so that I could communicate the result of my endeavours to you . ”</p>
   <p>Playfully drawing the ample folds of his habit together , so that the outlines of his tightly laced waist became visible , he assumed a complacent and expectant attitude . Praxedis stepped back , and stamped her foot on the blue cornflower .</p>
   <p>“ You are a bad , wicked man ! ” she cried turning her back on him .</p>
   <p>Rudimann , who knew how to interprete physiognomy , clearly saw from the twitching of Praxedis 's eyelids , and the angry frown on her forehead , that her chamber-door would be locked , now and ever , against all the cellarers in Christendom .</p>
   <p>She went away . “ Have you still any commands ? ” asked she , once more looking back .</p>
   <p>“ Yes , thou Greek wasp ! A jug of vinegar if you please . I want to lay my rods in it ; the writing is easier then , and will not fade away so soon . I have as yet never had the good fortune to flog an interpreter of Virgil . Such a scholar verily deserves particular attention . ”</p>
   <p>Burkhard , the cloister-pupil , was still sitting under the linden-tree , sobbing . Praxedis , in passing gave him a kiss , chiefly to spite the cellarer . She went up to the Duchess , intending to implore her compassion for Ekkehard on her knees ; but the door remained locked against her . Dame Hadwig was deeply hurt . If the monks of the Reichenau had not come in upon them , she might have pardoned Ekkehard 's frenzy ; all the more as she herself had sowed the seeds of all this ,— but now it had become a public scandal , which demanded punishment . The fear of gossiping tongues , does influence many an action .</p>
   <p>The Abbot had sent her the letter from St. Gall . “ St. Benedict 's rules , ” so the letter said , “ exacted not only the outward forms of a monastic life , but the self-denial of heart and soul , which forms the spirit of it ! ” Ekkehard was to return . From Gunzo 's libel , some parts were quoted against him .</p>
   <p>It was all perfectly indifferent to the Duchess . What his fate would be , if delivered into the hands of his antagonists , she knew quite well . Yet she was determined to do nothing for him . Praxedis knocked at her door a second time , but again it was not opened .</p>
   <p>“ Oh thou poor moth , ” said she sadly .</p>
   <p>Ekkehard meanwhile , lay in his dungeon like one who had dreamt some wild dream . Four bare walls surrounded him ; some faint gleams of light falling in from above . Now and then , he shivered as with cold . By degrees a melancholy smile of resignation settled on his lips , but this did not always remain there ; bursts of anger , which made him clench his fists , interrupted it .</p>
   <p>It is the same with the human mind as with the sea . Though the tempest may have blown over , the surge is yet stronger and more impetuous than before , and now and then , some mighty straggling wave dashes wildly up , frightening the seagulls away from the rocks .</p>
   <p>But Ekkehard 's heart was not yet broken . It was still too young for that . He began to reflect on his position . The view into the future was not very cheering . He well knew the rules of his order , and that the men from Reichenau were his enemies .</p>
   <p>With big strides he paced up and down the narrow space . “ Great God , whom we may invoke in the hour of affliction , how will this all end ? ”</p>
   <p>He shut his eyes , and threw himself on the bundle of straw . Confused visions passed before his soul . Thus he saw with his inward eye , how they dragged him out in the early morning . The Abbot would be sitting on his high stone chair , with the hooked staff in his hand , in sign of his sitting in judgment , and then they would read out a long bill of complaints against him , ... all this in the same courtyard in which he had once sprung out of the sedan chair , with such a jubilant heart , and in which he had preached his sermon against the Huns , on that solemn Good-Friday ,— and now they were all against him !</p>
   <p>“ What shall I do ? ” thought he . “ With my hand on my heart , and my eyes raised towards Heaven , I shall say : ‘ Ekkehard is not guilty ! ’ Then the judges will say , ‘ prove it ! ’ ” The big kettle is fetched ; the fire lighted beneath , so that the water hisses and bubbles . Then , the Abbot draws off the golden ring from his finger . They push up the right sleeve of his habit , whilst solemn penitential psalms are chaunted around them . “ I conjure thee , spirit of the water , that the Devil quit thee , and that thou serve the Lord , to make known the truth , like to the fiery furnace of the King of Babylon , when he had the three men thrown into it ! ” — Thus the Abbot would address the boiling water ; and “ dip in thy arm , and fetch the ring , ” says he to the accused ....</p>
   <p>“ Just God , how will thy ordeal speak ? ” Wild doubts were besetting Ekkehard 's soul . He believed in himself and his good cause , but his faith was less strong in the dreadful means , by which priestcraft and church-laws sought to arrive at God 's decision .</p>
   <p>In the library of his monastery there was a little book , bearing the title : “ Against the inveterate error of the belief , that through fire , water or single combat , the truth of God 's judgment could be revealed . ”</p>
   <p>This book he had once read , and he remembered it well . It was to prove , that with these ordeals , which were an inheritance from the ancient Heathen time , it was as the excellent Godfrey of Strassburg has expressed it in later days , namely “ that the best Christian , is as combustible as an old rag . ”</p>
   <p>“ And what , if no miracle is performed ? ”</p>
   <p>His thoughts were inclined to dark and despondent doubts .— “ With burnt arm , to be proclaimed guilty and to be flogged ,— whilst she perhaps would stand on the balcony looking on , as if it were being done to an entire stranger .— Oh Lord of Heaven and Earth send down Thy lightning ! ”</p>
   <p>Yet hope does not entirely forsake even the most miserable . Then , he fancied again how through all this shame and misery , a piercing “ stop ! ” was heard , and how she flew down with dishevelled locks , and in her rustling ducal mantle drove his tormentors away , as the Saviour drove out the usurers from the temple . And then , when all were gone , she presents him both her hand and lips to receive the kiss of reconciliation .— Long and ardently his phantasy dwelt on that beautiful possibility , which filled his heart with a soft consolation , and he spoke with the words of the Preacher : “ As gold is purified from dross in the fire , so the heart of man is purified by sorrow . ”</p>
   <p>He now heard a slight noise in the antichamber of his dungeon . A stone jug was put down . “ You are to drink like a man , ” said a voice to the lay-brother on guard , “ for on St. John 's night , all sorts of unearthly visitors people the air and pass over our castle . So you must take care to strengthen your courage . There 's another jug set ready , when this is finished . ”</p>
   <p>It was Praxedis who had brought the wine . Ekkehard did not understand what she wanted . “ Then she also is false , ” thought he . “ God protect me ! ”</p>
   <p>He closed his eyes and soon fell asleep . Some hours later he awoke . The wine had evidently been to the lay-brother 's taste , for he was lustily singing a song in praise of the four goldsmiths , who had refused the making of heathenish idols at Rome ; for which they had suffered martyrdom . With his heavy sandal-clad foot , he kept beating time on the stone-flags . Ekkehard heard that another jug of wine was brought in . The singing became always louder and more uproarious . Then he held a soliloquy ; in which he spoke much about Italy and good fare , and Santa Agnese fuori i muri , until he suddenly ceased talking , whilst his snoring could be heard very plainly through the stone walls .</p>
   <p>Everything was silent around . It was about midnight . Ekkehard lay in a half-slumbering state , when he heard the bolts of the door softly withdrawn . He remained lying where he was . A muffled figure came in , and a soft little hand was laid on the slumberer 's forehead . He jumped up .</p>
   <p>“ Hush ! ” whispered Praxedis , for it was she .</p>
   <p>When everybody had gone to rest , Praxedis had kept awake . “ The bad cellarer shall not have the satisfaction of punishing our poor melancholy teacher , ” she had said to herself ; and woman 's cunning always finds some way and means to accomplish its schemes . Wrapping herself up in a grey cloak , she had stolen down on tip-toe . No special artifices were necessary , for the lay-brother was sleeping the sleep of the just . If it had been otherwise , the Greek would have frightened him by some ghost-trickery . That would have been her plan .</p>
   <p>“ You must fly ! ” said she to Ekkehard . “ They mean to do their worst to you . ”</p>
   <p>“ I know it , ” replied he sadly .</p>
   <p>“ Come then . ”</p>
   <p>He shook his head . “ I prefer to submit and to suffer , ” said he .</p>
   <p>“ Do n't be a fool , ” whispered Praxedis . “ First you built your castle on the glittering rain-bow , and now that it has all tumbled down , you will allow them to illtreat you , into the bargain ? As if they had a right to drag you away and to flog you ! And you will let them have the pleasure of witnessing your humiliation ?... it would be a nice spectacle for them , to be sure ! ‘ One does not see an honest man hung every day , ’ said a man to me once in Constantinople , when I asked him why he was running . ”</p>
   <p>“ Where should I go to ? ” asked Ekkehard .</p>
   <p>“ Neither to the Reichenau , nor to your monastery , ” said Praxedis . “ There is still many a hiding-place left in this world . ” She was getting impatient , and seizing Ekkehard by the hand , she dragged him on . “ Forwards ! ” whispered she . He allowed himself to be led .</p>
   <p>They slunk past the sleeping watchman ; and now they stood in the courtyard , where the fountain was splashing merrily . Ekkehard bent over the spout , and took a long draught of the cool water .</p>
   <p>“ All is over now , ” said he . “ And now away ! ”</p>
   <p>It was a stormy night . “ As the bridge is drawn up , you cannot go out by the doorway ; ” said Praxedis , “ but you can get down between the rocks , on the eastern side . Our shepherd-boy has tried that path before . ”</p>
   <p>They entered the little garden . A gust of wind was rocking the branches of the maple-tree , to and fro . Ekkehard felt as if he were in a dream .</p>
   <p>He mounted the battlement . Steep and rugged the grey rocks sloped into the valley , that now looked like a dark yawning abyss . Black clouds were chasing each other , along the dusky sky ; weird uncouth shapes , resembling two bears pursuing a winged dragon . After a while , the fantastic forms united into one shapeless mass , which the wind drifted onwards towards the Bodensee , that glittered faintly in the distance . The whole landscape could only be seen in indistinct outlines .</p>
   <p>“ Blessings on your way , ” said Praxedis .</p>
   <p>Ekkehard sat perfectly motionless on the battlement , still holding the Greek maiden 's hand clasped in his . His lips could not express the feelings of gratitude which pervaded his whole being . Suddenly he felt her cheek pressed against his , and a trembling kiss imprinted on his forehead , followed by a pearly tear . Softly , Praxedis then drew away her hand .</p>
   <p>“ Do n't forget , ” said she , “ that you still owe us a story . May God lead your steps back again to this place , some day , so that we may hear it from your own lips . ”</p>
   <p>Ekkehard now let himself down . Waving one last farewell with his hand , he soon disappeared from her sight . The stillness of night was interrupted by a loud clatter and booming amongst the cliffs . A piece of rock had become loosened , and fell noisily down into the valley . Another followed somewhat slower , and on this Ekkehard was sitting ; guiding it as a rider does his horse . So he went down the sloping precipice , through the black night ,— farewell !</p>
   <p>She crossed herself , and went back , smiling through her tears . The lay-brother was still fast asleep . Whilst crossing the courtyard , Praxedis spied a basket filled with ashes , which she seized , and softly stealing back into Ekkehard 's dungeon , she poured out its contents in the middle of the room , as if this were all that were left of the prisoner 's earthly remains .</p>
   <p>“ Why dost thou snore so heavily , most reverend brother ? ” said she hurrying away .</p>

    <head>CHAPTER XXII .</head>
     <l n="1">On the Wildkirchlein .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And now , much beloved reader , we must bid thee to gird thy loins , take thy staff in hand , and follow us up into the mountains . From the lowlands of the Bodensee , our tale now takes us over to the Helvetian Alps . There , the Saentis stretches out grandly into the blue air ,— when he does not prefer to don his cloud-cap ,— smilingly looking down into the depths below , where the towns of men , shrivel up to the size of ant-hills . All around him , there is a company of fine , stalwart fellows , made of the same metal , and there , they put their bold heads together , and jestingly blow misty veils into each other 's faces . Over their glaciers and ravines , a mighty roaring and rustling is heard at times ; and that , which they whispered to each other , respecting the ways and doings of mankind , had already a somewhat contemptuous tinge , a thousand years ago ,— and since then , it has not become much better I fear .</p>
   <p>About ten days after the monks of the Reichenau had found nothing but a heap of ashes instead of their prisoner , in the castle-dungeon , and had debated a good deal , whether the Devil had burnt him up at midnight , or whether he had escaped ,— a man was walking up the hills , along the white foaming Sitter , over luxuriant meadow-lands , interspersed with rocks .</p>
   <p>He wore a mantle made of wolves ’ skins over his monkish garb ; a leathern pouch at his side , and he carried a spear in his right hand . Often , he pushed the iron point into the ground , and leaned on the butt end , using the weapon thus , as a mountain-stick .</p>
   <p>Round about , there was perfect silence and solitude . Long stretches of mist were hovering over the wild valley , where the Sitter comes out of the Seealpsee ; whilst at the side , a towering wall of rocks , fringed by scanty green plants , rose up towards heaven .</p>
   <p>The mountain glens , which in the present days , are inhabited by a merry and numerous race of herdsmen , were then but scantily peopled . Only the cell of the Abbot of St. Gall stood there in the valley ; surrounded by a few small , humble cottages .</p>
   <p>After the bloody battle of Zulpich , a handful of liberty-loving Allemannic men , who could not learn to bend their necks to the Franconian yoke had settled down in that wilderness . Their descendants were still living there , in scattered , shingle-covered houses , and in summer they drove their herds up into the Alps . They were a race of strong and healthy mountaineers , who , untouched by the goings on in the world at large , enjoyed a simple free life , which they bequeathed to the following generations .</p>
   <p>The path which was followed by our traveller , became steeper and rougher . He now stood before a steep overhanging wall of rocks . A heavy drop of water had fallen on his head from above ; upon which he cast up a searching look , to see whether the grim canopy of stones , would yet delay falling down , till he had passed by . Rocky walls , however , luckily can remain longer in an oblique position , than any structure made by human hands ; so nothing fell down , but a second drop .</p>
   <p>Leaning with his left hand on the stone wall , the man continued his way , which , however , became narrower with every step he took . The dark precipice at his side came nearer and nearer ; a giddy depth yawning up at him , ... and now all trace of a pathway ceased altogether . Two mighty pine-trunks were laid over the abyss , serving as a bridge .</p>
   <p>“ It must be done , ” said the man , boldly stepping over it . Heaving a deep sigh of relief , when his feet touched ground again on the other side , he turned round to inspect the dangerous passage , somewhat more at his leisure .</p>
   <p>It was a narrow promontory , above and below which there was a steep , yellowish grey wall of rocks . In the depth below , scarcely visible , was the mountain-brook Sitter , like a silver band in the green valley , whilst the seagreen mirror of the Seealpsee , seemed to hide itself shyly between the dark fir-trees . Opposite , in their armour of ice and snow , there rose the host of mountain-giants ; and the pen feels a shudder of delight pass through it , when called upon to write down their names . The long stretched bewildering Kamor ; the tremendous walls of the Boghartenfirst ; the Sigelsalp and Maarwiese , on whose battlements grows a luxurious vegetation , like moss on the roofs of old houses . Then , the mysterious keeper of the secret of the lake , the “ old man , ” with his deeply furrowed stone-forehead , and hoary head ,— the chancellor and bosom-friend of the mighty Saentis .</p>
   <p>“ Ye mountains and vales , praise the Lords ! ” exclaimed the wanderer , overwhelmed by the grandeur of the spectacle before him . Many hundreds of mountain-swallows fluttered out of the crevices between the rocks . Their appearance was like a good omen for the lonely traveller .</p>
   <p>He made some steps onwards . There , the wall of rocks had many a fissure , and he saw a twofold cavern . A simple cross , made of rudely carved wood , stood beside it . Stems of fir-trees , heaped up on one side , and interlaced with branches of the same , in the manner of a blockhouse , bore witness to its being a human habitation . Not a sound interrupted the stillness around .</p>
   <p>The stranger knelt down before the cross , and prayed there a long while .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">It was Ekkehard ,— and the place where he knelt , was the</l>
     <l n="2">“ Wildkirchlein . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>He had reached the valley in safety on his stone horse , after Praxedis had freed him . The next morning found him weary and exhausted at the door of old Moengal , at Radolfszell .</p>
   <p>“ Oh , that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men ; that I might leave my people and go from them ! ” said he in the words of the prophet , after he had told the parish-priest all that had happened to him .</p>
   <p>Then , the old man pointed over towards the Saentis . “ Thou art right , ” said Moengal . “ The holy Gallus did the same . ‘ Into the wilderness will I go , and there shall I wait for Him , who will restore my soul 's health . ’ Perhaps he would never have become a saint , if he had thought and acted differently . Try to conquer thy grief . When the eagle feels sick , and his eyes grow dim , then he rises heavenwards , as far as his wings will carry him . The nearness of the sun gives a new youth . Do thou the same . I know a bonny nook for thee to recover thy health in . ”</p>
   <p>He then described the road to Ekkehard .</p>
   <p>“ Thou wilt find a man up there , ” continued he , “ who has not seen much of the world for the last twenty years . His name is Gottshalk . Give him my greeting , and let us hope that God has forgiven him his trespasses . ”</p>
   <p>The parish-priest did not say for what sin his old friend was doing penance up there . He had once been sent to Italy , when times were bad , to buy corn . When he came to Verona , he was well received by the quarrelsome bishop Ratherius , and he held his devotions in the venerable cathedral , where the remains of St. Anastasia lay unlocked in a golden shrine ; and the church was deserted , and the Devil tempted Gottshalk to take a keepsake to Germany . So , he took as much of the saint 's body as he could carry away under his habit ; an arm , a foot and some spine-bones , and secretly departed with his spoil . But from that hour he had lost his inward peace . By day and night , the saint appeared to him in her torn and mutilated condition ; walking with crutches and demanding back her arm and her foot . Over mountains and Alpine glens she followed him , and threateningly approached him even on the threshold of his own cloister . Then he threw away the stolen limbs , and fled half maddened to the heights of the Saentis ; there , to expiate his heavy sin in the hermit 's cell which he erected for himself .</p>
   <p>For two days old Moengal secreted his young friend in his cell , and then he rowed him across the lake during the night-time . “ Do n't go back to thy convent , ” said he when they were about to part company , “ lest their tittle-tattle should be the ruin of thee . Jeers and derision are worse than punishment . ‘ Tis true that thou deservest some lecturing ; but that must be done for thee , by the fresh mountain-breezes , which are better entitled to set thee right again , than thy fellow-monks . ”</p>
   <p>A spear and a wolf 's skin were his parting gifts to Ekkehard .</p>
   <p>Shyly and stealthily he continued his journey at night-time , and it was with bitterness of heart that like a stranger he passed his monastery , which still bore visible traces of the ravages of the Huns . Some windows were lighted up , and seemed to beckon to him ; but he only hurried onwards the quicker . The Abbot 's cell in the mountains , he also passed by , without entering . He did not wish to be recognized by anyone belonging to the monastery .</p>
   <p>... His prayers were ended now . Wistfully he gazed at the entrance of the cavern , waiting for Gottshalk the hermit 's coming out to welcome the visitor . But nobody appeared ; the cavern was empty .</p>
   <p>Sancta Anastasia ignosce raptori ! Holy Anastasia , pardon thy ravisher ! was written with juice from Alpine herbs on the bright-coloured rock . A stone trough caught up the water which came trickling through the crevices . It was so full that the water ran over .</p>
   <p>Ekkehard entered the cell . Some earthen dishes stood beside an old stone-flag , which probably had served as a hearth . In a corner there lay a coarse fishing-net , as well as a hammer and spade ; a rusty hatchet and a quantity of cut pine-logs .</p>
   <p>On some wooden boards was a sort of couch , consisting of straw and dry leaves , which looked rotten and decayed . Two rats , frightened by Ekkehard 's entrance , ran to hide in a crevice .</p>
   <p>“ Gottshalk , ” cried Ekkehard , using his hand like a speaking-trumpet . Then he uttered a sort of shout ; such as is customary amongst the mountaineers in those parts ; but nobody answered . In a jug , the milk it had once contained , had become a crusty substance . Mournfully Ekkehard stepped out again on the narrow strip of ground , which separated the cavern from the precipice .</p>
   <p>Gazing over to the left , he could see a small bit of the blue Bodensee , coming out behind the mountains . All the magnificence of the Alpine world , however , could not banish a feeling of unutterable woe from his heart . Alone and God-forsaken he stood there on the solitary height . He strained his faculty of hearing to the utmost , in the hope of catching the sound of a human voice , but the low and monotonous moaning of the wind in the pine-wood below , was all that he heard .</p>
   <p>His eyes became moist .</p>
   <p>It was getting late . What now ?... The cravings of hunger , drew off his attention for the moment . He still had provisions for three days with him . So he sat down before the cavern and took his evening meal ; moistening his bread with the tears he could not restrain .</p>
   <p>His mountain threw long , purple shadows on the opposite rocks , whose peaks only were still glowing in the sunshine .</p>
   <p>“ As long as the cross stands on yonder rock , I shall not be entirely forsaken , ” said he . He then collected some grass that grew outside and prepared himself a new couch , in the place of the old one . The cool evening air began to be felt . So he wrapped himself up in Moengal 's mantle and lay down . Sleep is the best cure for the sufferings of youth , and in spite of heartache and loneliness , it soon closed Ekkehard 's eyelids .</p>
   <p>The first dawn of morning rose over the head of the Kamor , and only the morning-star was still shining brightly , when Ekkehard started up from his slumbers . It was as if he had heard the merry tones of a herdsman 's shout , and on looking up , he saw a light shining out from the darkest recess of the cavern . He believed himself to be under the delusion of a dream ; that he was still in his dungeon and that Praxedis was coming to free him . But the light came nearer and proved to be a torch of pine-wood . A young girl , with high looped-up petticoats , was carrying this primitive candle . He jumped up . Without showing either fear or surprise , she stood before him , and said : “ God 's welcome to you . ”</p>
   <p>It was a bold , half wild looking maiden , with olive complexion and fiery sparkling eyes . Her dark abundant tresses were fastened behind by a massive silver pin , in the shape of a spoon . The braided basket on her back , and the Alpine stick in her right hand , marked her as being an inhabitant of the mountains .</p>
   <p>“ Holy Gallus , protect me from new temptation , ” thought Ekkehard ; but she called out cheerfully . “ Again I say , be welcome ! My father will be very glad to hear that we have got a new mountain-brother . One can well see by the little milk which the cows give , that the old Gottshalk is dead ,— he has said many a time . ”</p>
   <p>It did not sound like the voice of a female demon .</p>
   <p>Ekkehard was still sleepy and yawned .</p>
   <p>“ May God reward you ! ” ejaculated the maid .</p>
   <p>“ Why did you say , may God reward you ? ” asked he .</p>
   <p>“ Because you have not swallowed me up , ” laughed she , and before he could put any more queries , she ran away with her torch-light , and disappeared in the back of the cavern .</p>
   <p>Presently she returned , however ; followed by a grey-bearded herdsman , wrapped in a mantle made of lambs ’ skins .</p>
   <p>“ Father will not believe it ! ” cried she .</p>
   <p>The herdsman now took a deliberate survey of Ekkehard . He was a hale and hardy man ; who in the days of his youth , could threw a stone of a hundred weight above twenty paces , without losing an inch of his ground . His tanned face and his bare sinewy arms , were signs of his not yet having lost much of his strength .</p>
   <p>“ So you are going to be our new mountain-brother ? ” said he , good-naturedly extending his hand . “ Well , that 's right ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Ekkehard was a little embarrassed at the strangeness of the apparition .</p>
   <p>“ I intended to pay a visit to Brother Gottshalk , ” said he .</p>
   <p>“ Zounds ! there you are too late , ” said the herdsman . “ He lost his life last autumn . ‘ Twas a grievous affair . Look there ! ” — pointing to a wall of rocks in the depth below — “ on yonder slope he went to gather dry leaves ; I was there myself to help him . Suddenly , he started up , as if he had been bitten by a snake , and pointing over at the Hohenkasten , he cried : ‘ holy Anastasia , thou art made whole again , and standest on both feet , and beckonest to me with both thy arms ! ’ ... and down he jumped , as if there had been no abyss between the rock he stood on and the Hohenkasten . With a ‘ kyrie eleison ! ’ he went down into the frightful depth .— May God be merciful to his soul ! It was only this spring that we found the body , wedged in between the rocks ; and the vultures had carried off one arm and one leg , nobody knows whereto . ”</p>
   <p>“ Do n't frighten him ! ” said the maiden , giving her father a nudge .</p>
   <p>“ You can remain here notwithstanding that , all the same , ” continued he , “ You shall get all that we gave to Gottshalk ; milk and cheese , and three goats which may graze wherever they like . And if that wo n't satisfy you , you can ask for more , for we are no niggards and misers up here . In return , you will preach us a sermon each Sunday , and pronounce a blessing over meadows and pasture-grounds , so that storms and avalanches will cause no harm . Further , you have to ring the bell , to announce the hours . ”</p>
   <p>Ekkehard cast a doubtful look into the spacious cavern . It was a delicious feeling for him , to know that there were human beings close at hand : but he could not make out whence they came .</p>
   <p>“ Are your pasture-lands in the depths of the mountains ? ” asked he with a smile .</p>
   <p>“ He does not know where the Ebenalp is ! ” exclaimed the young girl compassionately . “ I will show it you . ”</p>
   <p>Her chip of pine-wood was still burning . She turned round to the back part of the cavern ; the men following on her heels . So they went through a dark and narrow passage , into the interior of the mountain ; fragments of stones were lying across the path . Often they had to bend down their heads , to be able to proceed . Faint , reddish gleams of light played on the projecting edges of the walls , and soon the flaring daylight appeared . The young girl struck her chip against the strangely formed stalactites , which hung down from the roof , so that it went out . A few steps more , and they stood on a wide and delicious Alpine tract .</p>
   <p>Innumerable flowers were exhaling their sweet fragrance . Veronicas , orchises and lovely blue gentians , grew there in great profusion ; and the Apollo , the magnificent butterfly of the Alps , with its shining red eyes on its wings , was hovering over the luxuriant petals .</p>
   <p>After the oppressive darkness and narrowness of the cavern , a magnificent and extensive panorama , was doubly grateful to the eye .</p>
   <p>The early morning mists were as yet lying in heavy and compact masses over the valley , looking like some mighty sea , which in the very moment , when its foam-crested billows were rising up , had been changed into stone . With clear , sharp outlines the mountain-peaks stood out against the blue sky ,— like giant isles rising out of the sea of mists . The Bodensee too , was covered up with vapoury clouds , and the rows of the far off Rhetian mountains , with their craggy pinnacles were just visible through the soft haze surrounding them . The melodious tinkling of the cow-bells , was the only sound that broke the silence of that early morning hour . In Ekkehard 's soul there rose a proud and yet humble prayer .</p>
   <p>“ You are going to stay with us , ” said the old herdsman . “ I can tell so by the expression of your eyes . ”</p>
   <p>“ I am a homeless wanderer , whom the Abbot has not sent out hither , ” said Ekkehard sadly .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ That 's all the same to us , ” replied the other . “ If but we , and the old</l>
     <l n="2">Saentis over there , are satisfied , then nobody else need be asked . The</l>
     <l n="3">Abbot 's sovereignty does not extend here . We pay him our tithes , when</l>
     <l n="4">his stewards come here to look at our cottages , on the day when the</l>
     <l n="5">milk is examined , because it is an old custom ; but except that , we have</l>
     <l n="6">an old proverb which says ‘ his fields and grounds I do not till , nor do</l>
     <l n="7">I bow before his will . ’ ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Look there ! ” pointing out a grey mountain-peak , which in solitary grandeur rose from far-stretching ice-fields ,— “ that is the high Saentis , who is the Lord and master of the mountains . We take off our hats to him , but to nobody else . There , to the right is the ‘ blue snow , ’ where in times long ago , there were meadows and pasture-grounds enough ; but a proud and overbearing man lived there , who was a giant , and whose pride increased with his flocks , so that he said : ‘ I will be king over all , that my eyes survey . ’ But in the depths of the Saentis , there arose a roaring and trembling ; and the ground opened and emitted floods of ice , which covered up the giant , his cottage , herds and meadows ; and from the eternal snow which lies there , cold chilling winds blow down , to remind one , that besides the lord of the mountains , nobody is meant to reign here ! ”</p>
   <p>The herdsman inspired Ekkehard with confidence . Independant strength , as well as a kindly heart could be perceived in his words . His daughter , meanwhile , had gathered a nosegay of Alpine roses , which she held out to Ekkehard .</p>
   <p>“ What is thy name ? ” asked he .</p>
   <p>“ Benedicta . ”</p>
   <p>“ That is a good name , ” said Ekkehard , fastening the Alpine roses to his girdle . “ Yes , I will remain with you . ”</p>
   <p>Upon this the old man shook his right hand , so as to make him wince , and then , seizing the Alpine horn which hung suspended on a strap at his side , he blew a peculiar signal .</p>
   <p>From all sides , answering notes were heard , and soon the neighbouring herdsmen all came over ; strong , wild-looking men , and assembled round the old man ; whom ,— on account of his good qualities ,— they had elected master of the Alps , and inspector of the meadows on the Ebenalp .</p>
   <p>“ We have got a new mountain-brother , ” said he . “ I suppose that none of you will object ? ”</p>
   <p>After this address they all lifted their hands , in sign of approval , and then stepping up to Ekkehard , they bade him welcome ; and his heart was touched and he made the sign of the cross over them .</p>
   <p>Thus Ekkehard became hermit of the Wildkirchlein , scarcely knowing how it had all come about . The master of the Ebenalp kept his word , and did his best to make him comfortable . The three goats were lodged in the side-cavern . Then , he also showed him an intricate hidden path between the rocks , which led down to the Seealpsee , which contained plenty of fine trout . Further , he put some new shingles into the gaps of the roof , that wind and weather had caused in Gottshalk 's blockhouse . By degrees , Ekkehard accustomed himself to the narrow confinement of his new domicile , and on the following Sunday he carried the wooden cross into the foreground of the cavern ; adorned it with a wreath of newly gathered flowers , and rang the bell which had hung at the entrance ever since Gottshalk 's time , and which bore the mark of Sancho , the wicked bell-founder at St. Gall . When his herdsmen , with their families of boys and girls were all assembled , he preached them a sermon on the transfiguration , and told them how everyone who ascended the mountain-heights with the right spirit , in a certain sense of the word , became transfigured also .</p>
   <p>“ And though Moses and Elijah may not come down to us , ” he cried , “ have we not the Saentis and the Kamor standing beside us ?— and they also are men of an old covenant , and it is good for us to be with them ! ”</p>
   <p>His words were great and bold ; and he himself wondered at them , for they were almost heretical , and he had never read such a simile in any of the churchfathers before . But the herdsmen were satisfied , and the mountains also ; and there was nobody to contradict him .</p>
   <p>At noon , Benedicta , the herdsman 's daughter came up . A silver chain adorned her Sunday bodice , which encircled her bosom like a coat of mail . She brought a neat milking-pail ; made of ashwood , on which , in simple outlines , a cow was carved .</p>
   <p>“ This , my father sends you , ” said she , “ because you have preached so finely , and have spoken well of our mountains ,— and if anybody should try to harm you , you are to remember that the Ebenalp is near . ”</p>
   <p>She threw some handsful of hazel-nuts into the pail . “ These , I have gathered for you , ” added she , “ and if you like them , I know where to find more . ”</p>
   <p>Before Ekkehard could offer his thanks , she had disappeared in the subterranean passage .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Dark-brown are the hazel-nuts ,</l>
     <l n="2">And brown like they , am I</l>
     <l n="3">And he who would my lover be ,</l>
     <l n="4">Must be the same as I ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">she sang archly , whilst going away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">A melancholy smile rose to Ekkehard 's lips .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The tempest in his heart had not yet been quite appeased . Faint murmurs were yet reverberating within ; like the thunderclaps of an Alpine storm , which are repeated by innumerable echoes from the mountains .</p>
   <p>A huge , flat piece of rock had fallen down beside his cavern . Melting snow had undermined it in the spring . It resembled a grave-stone , and he christened it inwardly , the grave of his love . There he often sat . Sometimes , he fancied the Duchess and himself lying under it ; sleeping the calm sleep of the dead ; and he sat down on it , and looked over the pine-clad mountains far away towards the Bodensee ,— dreaming . It was not well that he could see the lake from his cell , as the sight called up continual painful recollections . Often , his heart was brimful with bitter , angry pain ; often again he would strain his eyes in the direction of the Untersee of an evening , and whisper soft messages to the passing winds . For whom were they meant ?</p>
   <p>His dreams at night were generally wild and confused . He would find himself in the castle-chapel , and the everlasting lamp was rocking over the Duchess 's head as it did then ; but when he rushed towards her , she had the face of the woman of the wood , and grinned at him scoffingly . When he awoke from his uneasy slumbers in the early morning , his heart would often beat wildly , and the words of Dame Hadwig , “ oh , schoolmaster , why didst thou not become a warrior ? ” persecuted him , till the sun had risen high in the sky , or the appearance of Benedicta would banish them .</p>
   <p>Often again , he would throw himself down on the short , soft grass on the slope , and ponder over the last months of his life . In the pure , keen Alpine air , figures and events assumed clearer and more objective outlines before his inward eye , and he was tormented by the thought that he had behaved shyly and foolishly , and had not even succeeded in fulfilling his task by telling a story like Praxedis and Master Spazzo .</p>
   <p>“ Ekkehard thou hast made thyself ridiculous , ” muttered he to himself ; and then he felt , as if he must break his head against the rocks .</p>
   <p>A melancholy mind broods long over a wrong it has undergone ; quite forgetting that a blameworthy action is only blotted out in the memory of others , by better ones following .</p>
   <p>Therefore , Ekkehard was as yet not ripe for the healing delights of solitude . The ever-present recollection of past suffering had a strange effect on him . Whenever he sat all alone in his silent cavern , he fancied he heard voices that mockingly talked to him of foolish hopes , and the deceits of this world . The flight , and calls of the birds in the air , seemed to him the shrieks of demons , and all his praying would avail nothing against these fantastic delusions .</p>
   <p>When the terrors of the wilderness have once taken hold of a mind , eye and ear are easily deceived and apt to believe all the old legends and tales , which assert that the air , as well as water and earth , is inhabited by legions of immortal spirits .</p>
   <p>It was a soft , fragrant midsummer night . Ekkehard was just about to lay himself down on his simple couch , when the moon-beams fell right into the cavern . Two white clouds were sailing along the sky , one behind the other , and he overheard how they were talking together . One of them was Dame Hadwig , and the other Praxedis .</p>
   <p>“ I should really like to see , what the asylum of a wandering fool looks like , ” said the first white cloud , and swiftly hurrying down the steep rocky walls , she stood still on the Kamor , right opposite the cavern , and then floating down to the fir-trees which grew in great numbers in the valley below , she cried out : “ It is he ! Go and seize the blasphemer . ”</p>
   <p>Then , the fir-trees sprang into life and became monks ; thousands and thousands , and chaunting psalms and swinging rods in their hands , they began to climb up the rock towards the Wildkirchlein .</p>
   <p>Trembling with terror , Ekkehard jumped up and seized his spear ,— but now it was as if a host of will-o ’ - the-wisps , started out from the recesses of the cavern . “ Away with you , out from the Alps ! ” cried they threateningly . All his pulses throbbed in the heat of fever , and so he ran away over the narrow path , along the frightful precipice , into the dark night , like a madman .</p>
   <p>The second cloud was still standing beside the moon : “ I cannot help thee , ” said she with Praxedis 's voice , “ I do not know the way . ”</p>
   <p>Downhill he ran , as fast as his feet would carry him . Life had become a mere torture to him , and yet he caught hold of projecting parts of the rocks , and used his spear as a staff , not to fall down and thus get into the hands of the approaching spectres .</p>
   <p>The nightly descent from the Hohentwiel was mere child 's play , compared to this . Unconscious of all danger , he darted past precipices , and at last came down to level ground , beside the lake . The goats often fell down there , when they turned their eyes away from the grass , and gazed into the neck-breaking depth below .</p>
   <p>At last he stood still beside the mysteriously beckoning , green Seealpsee , over which the silvery moon-beams danced and trembled . The rotten trunks , lying about on the shores , gave forth a spectral light . Ekkehard 's eyes grew dim and filmy .</p>
   <p>“ Take me into thy arms , ” cried he , “ for my heart is panting for rest . ”</p>
   <p>He ran into the cool , silent flood , but his feet still touched ground , and the cooling waters of the mountain-lake , sent a delicious freshness through his feverish limbs . The water already reached to his breast , when he stopped and looked up confusedly . The white clouds had disappeared ; the moon-beams having dissolved them into transparent vapours . Magnificently , and yet sadly withal , the stars were glittering high over his head .</p>
   <p>In bold , fantastic lines the Moeglisalp stretched out its grass-covered horns towards the moon . On its left , stood calm and serious , the furrowed head of the “ old man ” and to the right , towering above its double belt of glaciers , the stern , grey pyramid of the Saentis , surrounded by innumerable crags and pinnacles ; looking like dark spectres of night .</p>
   <p>Then , Ekkehard knelt down on the pebbly ground of the lake , so that the waters closed over his head , and rising again after a while , he stood there immovably with lifted arms , as if he were praying .</p>
   <p>The moon now sank down behind the Saentis ; a bluish light trembled over the old snow of the glaciers . A rocking pain darted through Ekkehard 's brain . The mountains around him , began to rock and dance ; a wailing sound streamed through the pine-woods , and the lake rose and stirred , and its waves were alive with thousands and thousands of black tadpoles ....</p>
   <p>But in soft , dewy beauty , the figure of a woman rose from the waters , and floated up to the top of the Moeglisalp . There , she sat on the soft velvety grass , and shook the water from her long streaming tresses , and made herself a wreath of Alpine flowers .</p>
   <p>In the depths of the mountains there arose a growling and trembling . The Saentis stretched himself out to his full height , and so did the old man to his right . Like gigantic Titans of old , they stormed at each other . The Saentis seized his rocks , and threw them over , and the old man tore off his head and flung it at the pyramid of the Saentis . Now the Saentis stood on the right side , and the old man was flying before him to the left ;— but the lady of the lake , looked on in smiling composure , and from her mountain-peak , she mocked the stone combatants . And she shook her yellow curls , out of which there fell down a pearly waterfall ; and it flowed down wilder and wilder , till it whirled the maiden with the liquid eyes , back into the lake .</p>
   <p>Upon this , the uproar and strife ceased suddenly . The old man took up his head ; put it on again , and singing a sad , mournful strain , he returned to his old place . And the Saentis likewise had resumed his post , and his glaciers were glittering calmly as before .</p>
   <p>... When Ekkehard awoke the next morning , he lay in his cavern , shaken with feverish cold . His knees felt as if they were broken .</p>
   <p>The sun stood at his zenith , when Benedicta flitted past the cavern , and saw him lying there trembling , and wrapped in his wolf 's skin mantle . His habit hung heavy and dripping over a piece of rock .</p>
   <p>“ When you again are going to fish for trout in the Seealpsee , ” said she , “ you had better let me know , so that I can lead you . The goat-boy who met you before sunrise , told us that you had staggered up the hill like a man walking in his sleep . ”</p>
   <p>She went and rang the midday bell for him .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>CHAPTER XXIII .</head>
     <l n="1">On the Ebenalp .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>For six days Ekkehard was ill . The herdsmen nursed him , and a decoction of the blue gentian took away the fever . The Alpine air too , helped his recovery . A great shock had been necessary to restore his bodily as well as mental equilibrium . Now he was all right again , and heard neither voices , nor saw phantoms . A delicious feeling of repose and recovering health ran through his veins . It was that state of indolent , pleasant weakness , so beneficial to persons recovering from melancholy . His thoughts were serious , but had no longer any bitterness about them .</p>
   <p>“ I have learnt something from the mountains , ” said he to himself . “ Storming and raging will avail nothing , though the most enchanting of maidens were sitting before us ; but we must become hard and stony outside like the Saentis , and put a cooling armour of ice round the heart ; and sable night herself must scarcely know , how it burns and glows within . ”</p>
   <p>By degrees , all the sufferings of the past months , were shrouded and seen through a soft haze . He could think of the Duchess and all that had happened on the Hohentwiel , without giving himself a heartache . And such is the influence of all grand and beautiful nature , that it not only delights and softens the heart of the looker-on , but that it widens the mind in general , and conjures back the days , which have long since , become part and parcel of the inexorable Past .</p>
   <p>Ekkehard , had never before cast a retrospective glance on the days of his youth , but he now loved to fly there in his thoughts , as if it had been a paradise , out of which the storm of life had driven him . He had spent several years in the cloister-school at Lorsch on the Rhine . In those days he had no idea what heart-and-soul-consuming fire could be hidden in a woman 's dark eyes . Then , the old parchments were his world .</p>
   <p>One figure out of that time had , however , been faithfully kept in his heart 's memory ; and that was Brother Conrad of Alzey . On him , who was his senior by but a few years , Ekkehard had lavished the affection of a first friendship . Their roads in life afterwards became different ; and the days of Lorsch had been forced into the background , by later events . But now , they rose warm and glowing in his thoughts , like some dark hill on a plain , when the morning-sun has cast his first rays on it .</p>
   <p>It is with the human mind as with the crust of this old earth of ours . On the alluvion of childhood , new strata heap themselves up , in stormy haste ; rocks , ridges and high mountains , which strive to reach up to heaven itself , and the ground on which they stand , is forgotten and covered with ruins .— But like as the stern peaks of the Alps , longingly look down into the valleys , and often , overwhelmed by homesickness , plunge down into the depths from which they rose ,— in the same way , memory loves to go back to youth , and digs for the treasures which were left thoughtlessly behind , beside the worthless stones .</p>
   <p>So Ekkehard 's thoughts now recurred often to his faithful companion . Once more he stood beside him , in the arched pillar-supported hall , and prayed with him beside the mausoleums of the old kings , and the stone coffin of the blind Duke Thassilo . With him , he walked through the shady lanes of the cloister-garden , listening to his words ;— and all that Conrad had spoken then , was good and noble , for he looked at the world with a poet 's eye , and it was as if flowers must spring up on his way , and birds carol gaily , when his lips opened to utter words , sweeter than honey .</p>
   <p>“ Look over yonder ! ” Conrad had once said to his young friend , when they were looking down , over the land , from the parapet of the garden . “ There , where the mounds of white sand rise from the green fields , there was once the bed of the river Neckar . Thus , the traces of past generations , run through the fields of their descendants , and ‘ tis well if these pay them some attention . Here , on the shores of the Rhine , we stand on hallowed ground , and it were time that we set to collecting that , which has grown on it , before the tedious trivium and quadrivium , has killed our appreciation of it . ”</p>
   <p>In the merry holiday-time , Conrad and he had wandered through the Odenwald , where , in a valley , hidden by green drooping birch-trees , they had come to a well . Out of this they drank , and Conrad had said : “ bow down thy head , for this is the grove of the dead , and Hagen 's beech-tree and Siegfried 's well . Here the best of heroes received his death-wound from the spear of the grim Hagen , which entered his back , so that the flowers around were bedewed with the red blood . Yonder , on the Sedelhof , Chriemhildis mourned for her slain husband , until the messengers of the Hunnic king , came to demand the hand of the young widow . ” And he told him all about the princely castle at Worms , and the treasure of the Nibelungen , and the revenge of Chriemhildis , and Ekkehard listened with sparkling eager eyes .</p>
   <p>“ Give me thy hand ! ” he cried , when all was over , to his young friend . “ When we have become men , well versed in poetry , then we will erect a monument to the legends of the Rhine . My heart is even now brimful with the material for a mighty song of the prowess of heroes , perils , death and vengeance , and I likewise know the art of the horny Siegfried , how he made himself invulnerable ; for though there are no more any dragons to be slain in whose blood one could bathe , everyone , who with a pure heart breathes the mountain air , and bathes his brow in the morning dew , is gifted with the same knowledge . He can hear what the birds are singing in the trees , and what the winds tell of old legends , and he becomes strong and powerful ; and if his heart is in the right place , he will write it down for the benefit of others . ”</p>
   <p>Ekkehard had listened with an amazed , half fearful surprise at the other 's dashing boldness , and had said at last : “ My head is getting quite dizzy , when I listen to thee , and how thou intendest to become another Homerus . ”</p>
   <p>And Conrad had smilingly replied : “ Nobody will dare to chant another Iliad after Homer , but the song of the Nibelungen has not yet been sung , and my arm is young and my courage undaunted , and who knows what the course of time may bring . ”</p>
   <p>Another time they were walking together on the shores of the Rhine , and the sun , coming over the Wasgau mountains , was mirrored in the waves , when Conrad said : “ For thee I also know a song , which is simple and not too wild , so that it will suit thy disposition ; which prefers the notes of a bugle , to the roar of thunder . Look up ! Just as to-day , the towers of Worms shone and glistened in the sun , when the hero Waltari of Aquitania , flying from the Hunnic bondage came to Franconia . Here , the ferry-man rowed him over , with his sweetheart and his golden treasure . Through yonder dark , bluish looking wood he then rode , and there was a fighting and tilting , a rattling and clashing of swords and spears , when the knights of Worms , who had gone out in his pursuit , attacked him . But his love and a good conscience made Waltari strong , so that he held out against them all , even against King Gunther and the grim Hagen . ”</p>
   <p>Conrad then told him the whole legend with its details . “ Around all large trees , ” he concluded , “ wild , young sprouts shoot up in abundance ; and so round the trunk of the Nibelungen a whole thicket has sprung up , out of which he who has got the talent can build up something . Couldst thou not sing the Waltari ? ”</p>
   <p>But Ekkehard preferred at that time to throw pebbles , making them skim the water , and he only took in , half the meaning of that which his friend had said . He was a devoted cloister-pupil , and his thoughts were as yet contented with the tasks which fell to his daily share . Time separated the two friends , and Conrad had to fly from the cloister-school , because he had once said that the logic of Aristotle was mere straw . So he had gone out into the wide world , nobody knew whither ; and Ekkehard came to St. Gall pursuing his studies assiduously . There , he had grown into a learned and sensible young man , deemed fit to become a professor ; and he sometimes thought of Conrad of Alzey with something akin to pity .</p>
   <p>But a good seed-corn may for a long time lie hidden in a human heart , and yet at last germinate and bud , like the wheat from Egypt 's mummy-graves .</p>
   <p>That Ekkehard now delighted in dwelling on these recollections , was a proof that he had undergone a considerable change . And this was well . The caprices of the Duchess , and the unconscious grace of Praxedis , had refined his shy and awkward manners . The time of stirring excitement he had gone through during the invasion of the Huns , had given a bolder flight to his aspirations and had taught him to despise the paltry intrigues of petty ambition . Then , his heart received a mortal wound , which had to be struggled with and overcome ; and so , the cloister-scholar , in spite of cowl and tonsure , had arrived at a happy state of transition , in which the monk was about to become a poet , and walked about like a serpent which has assumed a new covering , and only watches for an opportunity to strip off its shabby old coat against some hedge or tree .</p>
   <p>Daily and hourly , when contemplating the ever-beautiful peaks of his mountains , and breathing the pure , fragrant Alpine air , it appeared a constant riddle to him , how he could ever have thought to find happiness in reading and poring over yellow parchment-leaves , and how he then almost lost his reason on account of a proud woman . “ Let all perish which has not strength to live , ” said he to himself , “ and build up a new world for thyself ; but build it inwardly ; large , proud and wide ,— and let the dead Past bury its dead ! ”</p>
   <p>He was already walking about again quite cheerfully in his hermitage , when one evening after he had rung the vesper-bell , the master of the Ebenalp came to him , carrying something carefully in a handkerchief . “ God 's blessing be with you , mountain-brother , ” said he . “ Well , you have had a good shaking-fit , and I came to bring you something as an after-cure . But I see that your cheeks are red and your eyes bright , so it has become unnecessary . ”</p>
   <p>He opened his handkerchief , and displayed a lively ant-hill ,— old and young ants with a quantity of dry fir-leaves . He shook the industrious little creatures down the hill-side .</p>
   <p>“ If you had not been well , you would have had to sleep on that to-night , ” said he with a laugh . “ That takes away the last trace of fever ! ”</p>
   <p>“ The illness is past , ” said Ekkehard , “ Many thanks for the medicine ! ”</p>
   <p>“ You had better provide yourself against the cold , however , ” said the herdsman , “ for a black cloud is hanging over the Bruelltobel , and the toads are coming out of their holes ; a sure sign that the weather is about to change . ”</p>
   <p>On the next morning all the peaks shone out in a dazzling white cover . A great deal of snow had fallen . Yet it was still much too early for the beginning of winter . The sun rose brightly , and tormented the snow with his rays , so as to make it almost repent having fallen .</p>
   <p>When Ekkehard that evening was sitting before his pine-wood torch , he heard a thundering noise , as if the mountains were toppling over . He started , and put his hand up to his forehead , fearing that the fever was coming back .</p>
   <p>This time , however , it was no fancy of a sick brain . A hollow echo boomed forth from the other side , rolling through the glens of the Sigelsalp , and Maarwiese . Then , there followed a sound like the breaking of mighty trees ,— a clattering fall , and all was silent again . Only a low , plaintive hum , could be heard all the night , coming up from the valley .</p>
   <p>Ekkehard did not sleep ; yet , since his experiences on the Seealpsee , he did not quite trust the evidence of his senses . In the early morning he went up to the Ebenalp . Benedicta stood before their cottage door and greeted him with a snow-ball . The herdsman laughed when questioned about the nightly disturbance .</p>
   <p>“ That music you will hear often enough , ” said he . “ An avalanche has fallen down into the valley . ”</p>
   <p>“ And the humming ? ”</p>
   <p>“ That I suppose to have been your own snoring . ”</p>
   <p>“ But I did not sleep , ” said Ekkehard .</p>
   <p>So they went down with him and listened . It was like a distant moaning coming up from the snow .</p>
   <p>“ If Pater Lucius of Quaradaves were still living , ” said Benedicta , “ I should believe it to be him ; as he had such a soft bear-like voice . ”</p>
   <p>“ Hush , thou wild bumble-bee ! ” cried her father . Then , they went to fetch shovels and Alpine sticks , the old man likewise taking his hatchet , and accompanied by Ekkehard , they followed the traces of the avalanche . It had fallen down from the Aesher , over earth and rock ; breaking the low fir-trees like straw . Three mighty tors , looking down into the valley like sentinels , stopped the fall . There , the snow had angrily heaped itself up , only a small part had fallen over . The chief bulk , broken to pieces by the violence of the encounter , lay about in fantastic masses . The herdsman stooped down , to place his ear on the snow ; then he advanced a few paces , and thrusting his mountain-stick in , he cried : “ here we must dig ! ”</p>
   <p>And they shovelled up the snow for a considerable while , and dug a regular shaft , so that the snow-walls on both sides , rose high over their heads . They had often to breathe on and rub their hands during their cold work . Suddenly the herdsman uttered a shout of delight , echoed by Ekkehard , for now a black spot had become visible . The old man ran to fetch the hatchet ; a few shovelsful more , and a shaggy object arose heavily , and , snorting and grunting , stretched out its forepaws , as if trying to shake off sleep ; and finally it slowly mounted one of the tors , and sat down .</p>
   <p>It was a huge she-bear , who , on a nightly fishing-expedition to the Seealpsee , had been buried alive with her spouse . The latter , however , gave no sign of life . He had been stifled by her side , and lay there in the quiet sleep of death . Around his snout there was yet a half angry , half defiant expression ; as if he had left this life with a curse on the early snow .</p>
   <p>The herdsman wanted to attack the she-bear with his hatchet , but Ekkehard restrained him , saying : “ Let her live ! One , will be enough for us ! ”</p>
   <p>Then , they drew the bear out , and together could hardly carry him . The she-bear sat on her rock , gazing down mournfully , and uttering a plaintive growl , she cast a tearful look on Ekkehard , as if she had understood his interference in her behalf . Then , she came down slowly , but not as if with hostile intentions . The men meanwhile had made a sling , with some twisted fir-branches , in which to drag their booty along . They both stepped back , hatchet and spear in hand , but the bear-widow bent down over her dead spouse , bit off his right ear and ate it up , as a memorial of the happy Past . After this , she approached Ekkehard walking on her hind-legs , who , being frightened at the prospect of a possible embrace , made the sign of the cross , and pronounced St. Gallus 's conjuration against bears : “ Go out and take thyself away from this our valley , thou monster of the wood . Mountains and Alpine glens be thy realm ; but leave us in peace , as well as the herds of this Alm . ”</p>
   <p>The she-bear had stopped , with a bitter melancholy look in her eyes , as if she felt hurt at this disdain of her friendly feelings . She dropped down on her fore-legs , and turning her back on the man who had thus banished her , walked away on all fours . Twice she looked back , before entirely disappearing from their sight .</p>
   <p>“ Such a beast , has the intelligence of a dozen men , and can read a person 's will , in his eyes , ” said the herdsman . “ Else , I should think you a saint , whom the inhabitants of the wilderness obey . ”</p>
   <p>Weighing the paws of the dead bear in his hand , he continued : “ Hurrah ! that will be a repast . These we will eat together next Sunday , with a dainty salad , made of Alpine herbs . The meat will be ample provision for us through the winter , and for the skin we will cast lots . ”</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Whilst they were dragging the victim of the avalanche up to the</l>
     <l n="2">Wildkirchlein , Benedicta sang :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ And he who digs for snow-drops ,</l>
     <l n="4">And whom fortune will befriend ,</l>
     <l n="5">Will by chance dig a bear out ,</l>
     <l n="6">And perhaps two , in the end . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The snow had been a mere soft sleet , which soon melted again . Summer came back once more to the mountains with heart-stirring warmth , and a peaceful Sabbath-quiet lay over the highlands . Ekkehard had regaled himself with the bear 's paws at dinner in company with the herdsman and his daughter . It was a savoury dish , coarse , but strengthening , and well suited for inhabitants of the mountains . Then he mounted the top of the Ebenalp , and threw himself into the fragrant grass , from whence he looked up at the blue sky , enjoying his recovered health .</p>
   <p>Benedicta 's goats were grazing around him , and he could hear how the juicy Alpine-grass was greedily munched between their sharp teeth . Restless clouds drifted along the hillsides ; and on a piece of white lime-stone , with her face towards the Saentis , sat Benedicta . She was playing on a queer sort of a flute . It was a simple and melodious air ; like a voice from the days of youth . With two wooden milk-spoons in her left hand she beat time . She was a proficient in this art , and her father would often say with regret : “ Tis really a pity ! She deserved to be called Benedictus , as she would have made a capital herdsman . ”</p>
   <p>When the rythmical air came to an end , she gave a loud shout in the direction of the neighbouring alp , upon which the soft tones of an Alpine horn were heard . Her sweetheart , the herdsman on the Klus stood under the dwarf fir-tree , blowing the ranz des vaches ,— that strange , primitive music , which unlike any other melody , seems at first a mere humming sound , which an imprisoned bumble-bee , searching for an outlet , might produce , and that by-and-by , rises and swells into that wondrous song of longing , love , and home-sickness , creeping into the very heart 's core ; filling it either with rapturous joy , or making it almost break with sorrow .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ I trow that you are quite well again , mountain-brother , ” cried</l>
     <l n="2">Benedicta to Ekkehard , “ as you are lying so contentedly on your back .</l>
     <l n="3">Did you like the music ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">“ Yes , ” said Ekkehard , “ go on ! ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>He could scarcely gaze his fill , on all the beauty around him . To the left , in silent grandeur , stood the Saentis , with his kindred . Ekkehard , already knew them by their different names , and greeted them as his dear neighbours . Before him , a confused mass of smaller hills and mountains , green luxuriant meadow-lands , and dark pine-woods lay extended . A part of the Rhinevalley , bordered by the heights of the Arl-mountains and the distant Rhaetian Alps , looked up at him . A vapoury stripe of mist indicated the mirror of the Bodensee , which it covered ; and all that he saw was wide and grand and beautiful .</p>
   <p>He , who has felt the mysterious influence which reigns on airy mountain-peaks , widening and ennobling the human heart , raising it heavenwards , in loftier thoughts , he , is filled with a sort of smiling pity , when he thinks of those , who , in the depth below , are dragging tiles and sand together , for the building of new towers of Babel ; and he will unite in that joyous mountain-cry , which according to the old herdsman , is equal to a paternoster before the Lord .</p>
   <p>The sun was standing over the Kronberg , inclining towards the west , and deluging the heavens with a flood of golden light . He likewise sent his rays into the mists over the Bodensee , so that the white veil slowly dissolved , and in soft , delicate blue tints , the Untersee became visible . Ekkehard strained his eyes , and beheld a filmy dark spot , which was the island of Reichenau , and a mountain which scarcely rose above the horizon , but he knew it well ,— it was the Hohentwiel .</p>
   <p>The ranz des vaches accompanied the tinkling of the cow-bells , and over the prospect was a continually increasing warmth of colour . The meadows were steeped in a golden-brown green , and even the grey lime-stone walls of the Kamor , were dyed with a faint roseate hue . Then , Ekkehard 's soul also glowed and brightened . His thoughts flew away , over into the Hegau , and he fancied himself once more sitting with Dame Hadwig on the Hohenstoffeln , when they celebrated Cappan 's wedding , and saw Audifax and Hadumoth , who appeared to him the very embodiment of earthly happiness , coming home from the Huns . There arose also from the dust and rubbish of the past , what the eloquent Conrad of Alzey , had once told him of Waltari and Hiltgunde . The joyous spirit of poetry entered his mind . He rose and jumped up into the air , in a way , which must have pleased the Saentis . In the imagery of poetry , the poor heart could rejoice over that , which life could never give it ;— the glory of knighthood , and the felicity of wedded love .</p>
   <p>“ I will sing the song of Waltari of Aquitania ! ” cried he to the setting sun , and it was as if he saw his friend Conrad of Alzey , standing between the Sigelsalp and Maarwiese , in robes of light , and nodding a smiling approval to this plan .</p>
   <p>So , Ekkehard cheerfully set to work . “ What is done here , must either be well done , or not at all , else the mountains will laugh at us , ” the herdsman had once said , to which remark , he had then nodded a hearty assent . The goat-boy was sent into the valley to fetch some eggs and honey ; so , Ekkehard begged his master to give him a holiday , and entrusted him with a letter to his nephew . He wrote it in a cipher , well known at the monastery , so that no other persons could read it . The contents of the letter were as follows :</p>
   <p>“ All hail and blessings to the cloister-pupil Burkhard ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Thou , who hast been an eye-witness of thy uncle 's sorrow , wilt know how to be silent . Do not try to find out where he is now , but remember that God is everywhere . Thou hast read in Procopius how Gelimer , the king of the Vandals , when he was a prisoner in the Numidian hills , and when his misery was great , entreated his enemies to give him a harp , so that he might give voice to his grief . Thy mother 's brother now begs thee , to give to the bearer of this , one of your small harps , as well as some sheets of parchment , colours and pens , for my heart in its loneliness , also feels inclined to sing a song . Burn this letter . God 's blessing be with thee ! Farewell ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Thou must be wary and cautious , as if thou wert going to take the young ones out of an eagle 's nest , ” Ekkehard said to the goat-boy . “ Ask for the cloister-pupil , who was with Romeias the watchman , when the Huns came . To him thou art to give the letter . Nobody else need know about it . ”</p>
   <p>The goat-boy , putting his forefinger to his lips , replied with a knowing look : “ With us no tales are repeated . The mountain-air teaches one to keep a secret . ”</p>
   <p>Two days afterwards he returned from his expedition , and unpacked the contents of his wicker-basket before Ekkehard 's cavern . A small harp , with ten strings , three-cornered so as to imitate a Greek delta ; colours and writing material , and a quantity of clean , soft parchment-leaves with ruled lines , lay all carefully hidden under a mass of green oak-leaves .</p>
   <p>The goat-boy however looked sullen and gloomy .</p>
   <p>“ Thou hast done thy business well , ” said Ekkehard .</p>
   <p>“ Another time , I wo n't go down there , ” grumbled the boy , clenching his fist .</p>
   <p>“ Why not ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Because there is no room for such as I . In the hall , I enquired for the pupil , and gave him the letter . After that , I felt rather curious to see what nice young saints those might be , who went to school there , with their monks ’ habits . So I went to the garden where the young gentlemen were playing with dice , and drinking , as it was a recreation day . I looked on , at their throwing stones at a mark , and playing a game with sticks , and I could not help laughing , because it was all so weak and miserable . And when they asked me , what I was laughing at , I took up a stone , and threw it twenty paces further than the best of them , and cried out : what a set of green-beaks you are ! Upon this , they tried to get at me with their sticks ; but I seized the one next to me , and sent him flying through the air , so that he dropped into the grass like a lamed mountain-rook ; and then they all cried out that I was a coarse mountain-lout , and that their strength lay in science and intellect . Then I wanted to know what intellect was , and they said : drink some wine , and afterwards we will write it on thy back ! And the cloister-wine being good , I drank a few jugs full , and they wrote something on my back . I do not remember how it was all done , for the next morning I had a very bad headache , and did not know any more about their intellect , than I had done before . ”</p>
   <p>Throwing back his coarse linen shirt , he showed his back to Ekkehard , on which with black cart-grease , in large capital letters the following inscription was written .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Abbatiscellani , homines pagani ,</l>
     <l n="2">Vani et insani , turgidi villani . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It was a monastic joke . Ekkehard could not restrain a laugh . “ Do n't mind it , ” said he , “ and remember that it is thy own fault as thou hast sat too long over thy wine . ”</p>
   <p>The goat-boy , however , was not to be appeased so easily .</p>
   <p>“ My black goats are far dearer to me , than all those younkers together , ” said he , buttoning his shirt again . “ But if ever I catch such a milksop on the Ebenalp , I will write something on his back with unburnt ashes , that he will not forget as long as he lives ; and if he is not satisfied with that , he may fly down the precipice , like an avalanche in spring . ”</p>
   <p>Still grumbling , the boy went away .</p>
   <p>Ekkehard then took up the harp , and sitting down at the foot of the crucifix before his cavern , he played a joyous air . It was a long time since he had last touched the chords , and it was an unspeakable delight for him , in that vast solitude , to give vent in low tuneful melodies , to the thoughts and feelings , that were oppressing his heart . And the fair lady Musica was Poetry 's powerful ally ; and the epic song of Waltari , which at first had approached him only in misty outlines , condensed itself into clearly defined figures ; which again grouped themselves into warm , life-glowing pictures . Ekkehard closed his eyes to see them still better , and then he beheld the Huns approaching ; a race of nimble , merry horsemen , with less repulsive faces than those against whom he had himself fought but a few months ago ; and they carried off the royal offspring from Franconia and Aquitania , as hostages ; Waltari and the fair Hiltgunde , the joy of Burgundy . And as he struck the chords with greater force , he also beheld King Attila himself , who was of tolerable mien , and well inclined to gaiety and the joys of the cup . And the royal children grew up at the Hunnic court , and when they were grown up , a feeling of home-sickness came over them , and they remembered how they had been betrothed to each other , from the days of their childhood .</p>
   <p>Then , there arose a sounding and tuning of instruments , for the Huns were holding a great banquet ; King Attila quaffed the mighty drinking-cup , and the others followed his example until they all slept the heavy sleep of drunkenness . Now he saw how the youthful hero of Aquitania , saddled his warhorse in a moon-lit night , and Hildegunde came and brought the Hunnic treasure . Then he lifted her up into the saddle , and away they rode out of Hunnic thraldom .</p>
   <p>In the background , in fainter outlines , there still floated pictures of danger , and flight , and dreadful battles with the grasping King Gunther .</p>
   <p>In large bold outlines , the whole story which he intended to glorify in a simple , heroic poem , stood out before his inward eye .</p>
   <p>That very same night , Ekkehard remained sitting up with his chip-candle , and began his work ; and a sensation of intense pleasure , came over him , when the figures sprang into life , under his hand . It was a great and honest joy ; for in the exercise of the poetic art , mortal man elevates himself to the deed of the Creator , who caused a world to spring forth out of nothing . The next day found him eagerly busying himself with the first adventures . He could scarcely account for the laws by which he regulated and interwove the threads of his poem , and in truth it is not always necessary to know the why and the wherefore of everything . “ The wind bloweth where it listeth , and thou hearest the sound thereof , but canst not tell whence it cometh , and whither it goeth ; so is every one that is born of the Spirit , ” says St. John .</p>
   <p>And if now and then a feeling of doubt and distrust of his own faculties came over him ,— for he was timidly organised , and sometimes thought that it was scarcely possible to attain anything without the help of books , and learned models ,— then , he would walk up and down the narrow path before his cavern , and riveting his looks on the gigantic walls of his mountains , he derived comfort and serenity from them ; and finally said to himself , “ In all that I write and conceive , I will merely ask the Saentis and the Kamor , whether they are satisfied . ” And with these thoughts , he was on a good track ; for the poetry of him , who receives his inspiration from old mother nature , will be genuine and truthful , although the linen-weavers , stonecutters , or the whole of that most respectable brotherhood of straw-splitters , in the depth below , may ten thousand times declare it to be , a mere fantastical chimera .</p>
   <p>Some days were thus spent , in industrious work . In the Latin verse of Virgil , the figures of his legend were clothed , as the paths of the German mother-tongue struck him as being still too rough and uneven , for the fair measured pace of his epic . Thus his solitude became daily more peopled . At first , he thought he would continue his work night and day , without any interruption ; but the physical part of our nature will claim its rights . Therefore he said : “ He who works , must attune his daily labour to the course of the sun ; ” and when the shadows of evening fell on the neighbouring heights , he made a pause ; seized his harp and with it ascended the Ebenalp . The spot , where the first idea of writing the epic had entered his mind , had become very dear to him .</p>
   <p>Benedicta welcomed him joyfully , when he came for the first time with his harp .</p>
   <p>“ I understand you , mountain-brother , ” said she . “ Because you are not allowed to have a sweetheart , you have taken to a harp to which you tell everything that 's going on in your heart . But it shall not be in vain that you have become a musician . ”</p>
   <p>Raising her hand to her mouth , she uttered a clear , melodious whistle , towards the low-thatched cottage on the Klusalp , which soon brought over the herdsman her sweetheart , with his Alpine horn . He was a strong and fine looking lad . In his right ear he wore a heavy silver ring , representing a serpent , suspended from which , on a tiny silver chain , hung the slender milkspoon , the herdsman 's badge of honour . His waist was encircled by the broad belt ; in front of which some monstrous animal , faintly resembling a cow , was to be seen . With shy curiosity depicted in his healthy face , he stood before Ekkehard ; but Benedicta said :</p>
   <p>“ Please to strike up a dance now ; for often enough we have regretted that we could not do it ourselves ; but , when he blows his horn he cannot whirl me round at the same time , and when I play on the flute , I cannot spare an arm . ”</p>
   <p>Ekkehard willingly struck up the desired tune , being much pleased at the innocent merriment of these children of the mountains ; and so they danced on the soft Alpine grass , until the moon rose in golden beauty over the Maarwiese . Greeting her with many a shout of delight , they still continued their dance ; singing at the same time , alternately some simple little couplets ...</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ And the glaciers grew upwards</l>
     <l n="2">Until nigh to the top ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">sang Benedicta 's lover , gaily whirling her round ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">“ And the storm blew so fiercely ,</l>
     <l n="7">And it blew night and day ,</l>

     <l n="9">If it had blown him away ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">she replied in the same measure .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>When at last , tired with dancing , they rested themselves beside the young poet , Benedicta said : “ Some day you will also get your reward , you dear , kind music-maker ! There is an old legend belonging to these mountains , that once in every hundred years , a wondrous blue flower blooms on the rocky slopes , and to him , who has got the flower , the mountains open , and he can go in and take as much of the treasures of the deep , as his heart desires ; and fill his hat to the brim with glittering jewels . If ever I find the flower , I will bring it to you , and you 'll become a very , very rich man ; ” for , added she , clasping the neck of her lover with both arms ,— “ I should not know what to do with it , as I have found my treasure already . ”</p>
   <p>But Ekkehard replied , “ neither should I know what to do with it ! ”</p>
   <p>He was right . He , who has been initiated in art , has found the genuine blue flower . Where others see nothing but a mass of rocks and stones , the vast realm of the beautiful opens to him ; and there he finds treasures which are not eaten up by rust , and he is richer than all the money-changers and dealers , and purse-proud men of the world , although in his pocket , the penny may sometimes hold a sad wedding-feast with the farthing .</p>
   <p>“ But what then are we to do with the blue flower ? ” asked Benedicta .</p>
   <p>“ Give it to the goats or to the big bull-calf , ” said her lover laughingly . “ They also deserve a treat now and then . ”</p>
   <p>And again they whirled each other around in their national dances , until Benedicta 's father came up to them . The latter had nailed the bear 's skull which had since been bleached by the sun , over the door of his cottage , after the day 's labours were done . He had stuck a piece of stalactite between the jaws , so that the goats and cows timidly ran away , scared by the new ornament .</p>
   <p>“ You make noise and uproar enough to make the Saentis tremble and quake , ” cried the old master of the Alps . “ What on earth are you doing up there ? ” Thus , good-naturedly scolding , he made them go into the cottage .</p>
   <p>The Waltari-song meanwhile , proceeded steadily ; for when the heart is brimful of ideas and sounds , the hand must hurry , to keep pace with the flight of thought .</p>
   <p>One midday , Ekkehard had just begun taking his usual walk on the narrow path before his cavern , when a strange visitor met his view . It was the she-bear , which he had dug out of the snow . Slowly she climbed up the steep ascent , carrying something in her snout . He ran back to his cave to fetch his spear , but the bear did not come as an enemy . Pausing respectfully at the entrance of his domicile , she dropped a fat marmot , which she had caught basking in the sunny grass , on a projecting stone . Was it meant as a present to thank him for having saved her life , or was it instigated by other feelings , who knows ?— To be sure , Ekkehard had helped to consume the mortal remains of her spouse ;— could some of the widow 's affection thus be transferred to him ?— we know too little about the law of affinities to decide this question .</p>
   <p>The bear now sat down timidly before the cavern , stedfastly gazing in . Then , Ekkehard was touched , and pushed a wooden plate with some honey towards her , though still keeping his spear in his hand . But she only shook her head mournfully . The look out of her small , lidless eyes was melancholy and beseeching . Ekkehard then took down his harp from the wall , and began to play the strain , which Benedicta had asked for . This evidently had a soothing effect on the deserted bear-widow 's mind ; for raising herself on her hind-legs , she walked up and down , with rhythmical grace ; but when Ekkehard played faster and wilder , she bashfully cast down her eyes , as her thirty-years-old bear 's conscience did not sanction her dancing . Then , she stretched herself out again before the cavern , as if she wanted to deserve the praise , which the author of the hymn in praise of St. Gallus , bestowed on the bears , when he called them , “ animals possessing an admirable degree of modesty . ”</p>
   <p>“ We two suit each other well , ” said Ekkehard . “ Thou hast lost what thou hast loved best , in the snow , and I , in the tempest ,— I will play something more for thee . ”</p>
   <p>He now chose a melancholy air which seemed to please her well , as she gave an approving growl now and then . But Ekkehard , ever inwardly busy with his epic , at last said : “ I have thought for a long while , what name I should give to the Hunnic queen , under whose care the young Hildgund was placed ; and now I have found one . Her name shall be Ospirin , the godlike bearess . Dost thou understand me ? ”</p>
   <p>The bear looked at him , as if it were all the same to her ; so Ekkehard drew forth his manuscript , and added the name . The wish to make known the creation of his mind to some living being , had for a long while been strong within him . Here , in the vast solitude of the mountains , he thought that the bear might take the place which under other circumstances would have required some learned scholar . So he stepped into his blockhouse , and leaning on his spear , he read out the beginning of his poem ; he read with a loud , enthusiastic voice , and the bear listened with laudable perseverance .</p>
   <p>So he read further and further ; how the knights of Worms , who persecuted Waltari , entered the Wasgau-forest , and fought with him ,— and still she listened patiently ; but when at last the single combat went on without end ,— when Ekkefried of Saxony fell down into the grass a slain man , beside the bodies of his predecessors , and Hadwart and Patavid , the nephews of Hagen , likewise shared the lot of their companions ,— then , the bear raised herself slowly , as if even she had grown tired of so much bloodshed ; and with stately steps strode down the valley .</p>
   <p>In a solitary rocky crag on the Sigelsalp opposite , was her domicile . Thitherwards she directed her steps , to prepare for the coming long sleep of winter .</p>
   <p>The epic , however , which of all living beings , was first heard by the she-bear of the Sigelsalp , the writer of this book , has rendered into German verse , during the long winter-evenings ; and though many a worthy translator had undertaken this task before him , he yet did not like to withhold it from the reader , in order that he may see , that in the tenth century , as well as in later ages , the spirit of poetry had set up her abode in the minds of chosen men .</p>

     <l n="1">The Song of Waltari .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">When Attila was king amongst the Huns ,—</l>
     <l n="3">Whose fame had sounded over lands and seas ,</l>
     <l n="4">Whose valiant hordes , had conquer 'd many kings ,</l>
     <l n="5">Destroying all who ventured to resist ,</l>
     <l n="6">And granting peace to those who bent their necks</l>
     <l n="7">Low in the dust , before his mighty sword ,</l>
     <l n="8">And paying heavy ransom thus were spar 'd ,—</l>
     <l n="9">One day the bugle sounded far and wide</l>
     <l n="10">Announcing that another war was near ,</l>
     <l n="11">Calling the men to arms , and then to horse</l>
     <l n="12">To go where'er their leader should decree .</l>
     <l n="13">And Attila , when all had been prepar 'd ,</l>
     <l n="14">Spoke thus unto his men , who breathless stood</l>
     <l n="15">To hear , what their great king would have to say .</l>
     <l n="16">“ Wearied of this long peace , I have resolv 'd ,</l>
     <l n="17">That though unask 'd , and like enough to be ,</l>
     <l n="18">Unwelcome too , we yet will tarry not ,</l>
     <l n="19">But pay a visit to the town of Worms</l>
     <l n="20">Franconia 's proud and noble capital . ”</l>
     <l n="21">Scarce had he ended , when a roaring shout ,</l>
     <l n="22">Broke on the silence like a cataract ,</l>
     <l n="23">Loud rose and wild their joyous , swelling cry ,</l>
     <l n="24">“ Long live the king ! long live King Attila . ”</l>
     <l n="25">Gay were the festivals then held at Worms</l>
     <l n="26">Where Gibich sat in his ancestral halls ,</l>
     <l n="27">To celebrate the birth of his first son ,</l>
     <l n="28">The heir which Heaven had denied him long .</l>
     <l n="29">But suddenly a pallor , icy cold</l>
     <l n="30">Spread o'er his features , turning them to stone ,</l>
     <l n="31">As if Medusa 's head he had beheld ;</l>
     <l n="32">For in that evil moment he had heard ,</l>
     <l n="33">That from the Danube came a dreadful host</l>
     <l n="34">Of enemies , who soon would flood his land ,</l>
     <l n="35">In numbers countless as the stars of heaven ,</l>
     <l n="36">And swifter than the scorching desert-winds .</l>
     <l n="37">In frighten 'd haste a council then was held ,</l>
     <l n="38">In which the wisest men the land possess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="39">Were to decide what it were best to do .</l>
     <l n="40">And in this danger , one and all agreed ,</l>
     <l n="41">That , as resistance were mere idle boast ,</l>
     <l n="42">‘ Twere better not to irritate their foes</l>
     <l n="43">But offer tribute , and give hostages ;</l>
     <l n="44">And rather give the something , which they ask 'd ,</l>
     <l n="45">Than lose their all ,— land , fortunes , with their lives .</l>
     <l n="46">But as King Gibich 's son , Gunther by name ,</l>
     <l n="47">Was but a suckling yet , as hostage he</l>
     <l n="48">Could not be sent ,— Sir Hagen in his place ,</l>
     <l n="49">Gibich 's own cousin was selected then ,</l>
     <l n="50">A young and stalwart knight , whose pedigree</l>
     <l n="51">Prov 'd his descent from noble , Trojan blood .</l>
     <l n="52">So , he was sent , with ample bags of gold</l>
     <l n="53">To make the peace with Attila the Hun .</l>
     <l n="54">In those same days , there reign 'd in Burgundy ,</l>
     <l n="55">King Herrich with a strong and mighty hand ;</l>
     <l n="56">Whose only child , the gentle Hildegund ,</l>
     <l n="57">Was fairer far , and lovelier to behold ,</l>
     <l n="58">Than any other maid in all the land</l>
     <l n="59">Whose future queen , she one day was to be .</l>
     <l n="60">But when Franconia had obtain 'd the peace ,</l>
     <l n="61">The Huns with all their concentrated force ,</l>
     <l n="62">Approach 'd the frontiers now of Burgundy ;</l>
     <l n="63">And at their head tow'ring above the rest ,</l>
     <l n="64">There rode the king , the dreaded Attila .</l>
     <l n="65">Behind him , pressing forward eagerly ,</l>
     <l n="66">A body-guard of noble Hunnic chiefs .</l>
     <l n="67">The earth reechoed with their horses ’ tramp ,</l>
     <l n="68">The clashing of their swords frighten 'd the air ,</l>
     <l n="69">And in the fields , an iron wood of spears ,</l>
     <l n="70">Shone out with reddish light , like dewy meads ,</l>
     <l n="71">On which the sun is casting his first rays .</l>
     <l n="72">And thus they scal 'd the mountains , cross 'd the streams ,</l>
     <l n="73">For nothing could impede their reckless speed .</l>
     <l n="74">Already they had pass 'd the river Rhone ,</l>
     <l n="75">And now came pouring in , a surging sea</l>
     <l n="76">Of men and riders , fearful to behold .</l>
     <l n="77">At Chalons sat King Herrich , fearing nought ,</l>
     <l n="78">When from the belfry rose the watchman 's cry ;</l>
     <l n="79">“ I see a cloud of dust , foreboding ill ,—</l>
     <l n="80">Our enemies have come , and so beware ,</l>
     <l n="81">And shut your houses ere it be too late . ”</l>
     <l n="82">The tale , of how Franconia had escap 'd</l>
     <l n="83">By paying tribute , had reach 'd Herrich 's ear ,</l>
     <l n="84">Who now address 'd his vassals in this way :</l>
     <l n="85">“ Well do we know that brave and valiant men ,</l>
     <l n="86">Franconia holds ;— and yet they did not dare ,</l>
     <l n="87">Resist the Huns , but made a treaty with</l>
     <l n="88">King Attila , and so I do not see ,</l>
     <l n="89">Why we , like fools , should risk to lose our lives .</l>
     <l n="90">One cherish 'd daughter do I but possess —</l>
     <l n="91">Yet for my country 's weal I 'll offer her</l>
     <l n="92">As hostage to the Huns , to guard the peace . ”</l>
     <l n="93">Bare-headed and unarmed , his messengers</l>
     <l n="94">Then went to meet the Huns , and sans delay ,</l>
     <l n="95">Into the presence of King Attila</l>
     <l n="96">They soon were brought , who did receive them well</l>
     <l n="97">As was his wont ,— to dissipate their fears ,</l>
     <l n="98">And then with gracious mien address 'd them thus :</l>
     <l n="99">“ Indeed , believe me , I myself prefer</l>
     <l n="100">A friendly treaty far , to bloody war ;</l>
     <l n="101">I am a man of peace , and only fight</l>
     <l n="102">Against the wanton fools , who dare to doubt</l>
     <l n="103">The power which I hold from Heaven 's self :</l>
     <l n="104">Therefore , your Master 's offer I accept . ”</l>
     <l n="105">This message then was brought unto the king ,</l>
     <l n="106">Who now went out himself , accompanied</l>
     <l n="107">By a long train of heavy laden men</l>
     <l n="108">Bearing the gold and jewel 's manifold</l>
     <l n="109">Which as a tribute to the Huns he paid .</l>
     <l n="110">And by the hand , fair as the morning star</l>
     <l n="111">He led his only daughter , Hildegund .</l>
     <l n="112">The peace was sign 'd ,— farewell sweet Hildegund</l>
     <l n="113">The pearl of Burgundy , its hope and joy .</l>
     <l n="114">Full of content at this new treaty made ,</l>
     <l n="115">King Attila now led his warriors brave</l>
     <l n="116">On to the west , to Aquitania</l>
     <l n="117">Where Alpher sway 'd the sceptre , strong and brave .</l>
     <l n="118">An only son , Waltari was his pride</l>
     <l n="119">Who yet a boy , promis 'd one day to be</l>
     <l n="120">All that a father 's heart could wish to see .</l>
     <l n="121">Herrich and Alpher , old and faithful friends ,</l>
     <l n="122">With many a solemn oath on either side ,</l>
     <l n="123">Had long decreed , that when the time should come ,</l>
     <l n="124">Their children 's hands in wedlock should be join 'd .</l>
     <l n="125">Sadly King Alpher brooded in his halls ,</l>
     <l n="126">On that which it behov 'd him now to do .</l>
     <l n="127">“ Alack ! ” he cried , “ that in my hoary days</l>
     <l n="128">I cannot find my death , by lance or sword ;</l>
     <l n="129">But now that Burgundy has deign 'd to crave</l>
     <l n="130">A shameful peace , such as Franconia 's king</l>
     <l n="131">First did conclude ,— what now is left to me ,</l>
     <l n="132">But do the same ?— dispatch my messengers</l>
     <l n="133">And offer bribes of gold ,— and worse than all ,</l>
     <l n="134">My only son as hostage to the foe ! ”</l>
     <l n="135">Thus spoke King Alpher , and so was it done .</l>
     <l n="136">Laden with gold , the Huns returned home ,</l>
     <l n="137">With Hagen , Hildegund and Alpher 's son ,</l>
     <l n="138">They gladly greeted their Pannonian home ,</l>
     <l n="139">And here our captives led no evil life ,</l>
     <l n="140">For Attila was not a cruel man</l>
     <l n="141">By nature ;— so he had them treated well ,</l>
     <l n="142">Almost as if they 'd been his flesh and blood .</l>
     <l n="143">The maiden Hildgund , to his wife the queen ,</l>
     <l n="144">Ospirin was her name , entrusted was ,</l>
     <l n="145">Whilst the two princes , he himself took care</l>
     <l n="146">To see well-taught in all the warlike arts</l>
     <l n="147">Neglecting nothing , fitted for their rank .</l>
     <l n="148">And so they grew in years and wisdom too ,</l>
     <l n="149">Outstripping all in strength , and witty speech ,</l>
     <l n="150">For which the king did love them both alike</l>
     <l n="151">And placed them high above the noble Huns .</l>
     <l n="152">The German maiden too , soon won the heart</l>
     <l n="153">Of Ospirin , the proud and haughty queen .</l>
     <l n="154">The soft and winning ways of fair Hildgund ,</l>
     <l n="155">Did gain her confidence , until at last ,</l>
     <l n="156">She made her keeper of the treasure-room .</l>
     <l n="157">Next to the queen she was in honour held ;</l>
     <l n="158">Her slightest wish , scarce uttered was obey 'd .</l>
     <l n="159">Meanwhile King Gibich fell a prey to death ,</l>
     <l n="160">So that his throne was now by Gunther held ,</l>
     <l n="161">Who broke the treaty made with Attila ,</l>
     <l n="162">And offer 'd scoff and taunts instead of gold ,</l>
     <l n="163">Unto the messengers that he had sent .</l>
     <l n="164">As soon as Hagen heard this welcome news ,</l>
     <l n="165">He fled by night , and safely reach 'd the court</l>
     <l n="166">Of Gunther , who receiv 'd him full of joy .</l>
     <l n="167">Great was the sorrow in the morning , when</l>
     <l n="168">King Attila first heard of Hagen 's flight ;</l>
     <l n="169">And with a cunning mien the queen spoke thus :</l>
     <l n="170">“ Oh Lord and spouse , I warn thee to beware ,</l>
     <l n="171">Lest Walter too , thy pillar of support</l>
     <l n="172">Try to escape , like to his faithless friend .</l>
     <l n="173">Therefore I pray thee , follow my advice ,</l>
     <l n="174">And to Waltari say with friendly speech :</l>
     <l n="175">In many battles thou hast prov 'd thy arm ,</l>
     <l n="176">Strong and untiring in thy master 's cause .</l>
     <l n="177">Therefore , I fain would give thee now some sign ,</l>
     <l n="178">Of my approving love and gratitude .</l>
     <l n="179">Of all the noble Hunnic maidens here ,</l>
     <l n="180">I bid thee choose the best to be thy wife</l>
     <l n="181">And what of goods and lands thou wilt demand ,</l>
     <l n="182">It shall be granted , ere you say the word . ”</l>
     <l n="183">These words well pleas 'd the king , and show 'd him how</l>
     <l n="184">A woman 's cunning often hits the mark ,</l>
     <l n="185">Which has escap 'd the prudent eye of man .</l>
     <l n="186">And so he bade Waltari come to him</l>
     <l n="187">And told him all the queen had said before .</l>
     <l n="188">But though his words he temptingly set forth</l>
     <l n="189">Waltari guessing all that lay beneath ,</l>
     <l n="190">And having long before form 'd other plans ,</l>
     <l n="191">With subtle speech , his fears tried to dispel .</l>
     <l n="192">“ Oh prince , all I have done is quickly told ,</l>
     <l n="193">And scarce deserves the kindly praise you deign</l>
     <l n="194">To lavish on my poor , though faithful deeds .</l>
     <l n="195">But if I were to follow your command ,</l>
     <l n="196">And take a wife , my time would be engross 'd ,</l>
     <l n="197">By other cares and duties manifold ;</l>
     <l n="198">Which all would serve to make me turn away ,</l>
     <l n="199">And leave the path of honour by your side .</l>
     <l n="200">For when you love a wife , you dislike war ,</l>
     <l n="201">Which is to tear you from her loving arms .</l>
     <l n="202">And so , my gracious lord I do beseech ,</l>
     <l n="203">Not thus to banish me from his dear side .</l>
     <l n="204">And never , when you order me to fight</l>
     <l n="205">By night or day , my sword you 'll idle find ;</l>
     <l n="206">And in the midst of battle ne'er my eyes</l>
     <l n="207">Shall be found looking backwards , towards the spot</l>
     <l n="208">Where wife and children I did leave behind ,—</l>
     <l n="209">A thought to lame my arm and dim my eye .</l>
     <l n="210">Therefore , by your own valour and my own ,</l>
     <l n="211">I beg you not to force this yoke on me . ”</l>
     <l n="212">Then Attila was touch 'd , and in his soul</l>
     <l n="213">He thought , “ Waltari never thinks of flight ! ”</l>
     <l n="214">Meanwhile rebellion dared to raise her head</l>
     <l n="215">In distant lands , amongst another tribe ,</l>
     <l n="216">Against whose province war was now proclaim 'd ,</l>
     <l n="217">And young Waltari then was named chief</l>
     <l n="218">Of all the army ; and it was not long</l>
     <l n="219">Before a battle waged long and fierce .</l>
     <l n="220">Full valiantly they fought the Hunnic hordes ,</l>
     <l n="221">Filling the air with their redundant cries ,</l>
     <l n="222">To which the trumpets join 'd their piercing voice .</l>
     <l n="223">Like glaring sheets of lightning flew the spears</l>
     <l n="224">Splitting the shields and helmets of the foe ,</l>
     <l n="225">And as the pelting hailstones in a storm ,</l>
     <l n="226">So fell the arrows , swift and merciless .</l>
     <l n="227">And wilder still , and fiercer grew the fight ,</l>
     <l n="228">Until they drew the sword , and man to man they fought .</l>
     <l n="229">Then many a rider lay with fractur 'd skull ,</l>
     <l n="230">Beside his horse , fell 'd by the self same sword .</l>
     <l n="231">And in the foremost ranks Waltari fought ,</l>
     <l n="232">As if King Death himself with nimble scythe ,</l>
     <l n="233">Were mowing down his harvest ,— thus he stood</l>
     <l n="234">Filling with awe the hearts of all around ,</l>
     <l n="235">And causing a wild flight where'er he turn 'd</l>
     <l n="236">So that the bloody victory was won ,</l>
     <l n="237">And great the booty which they made that day .</l>
     <l n="238">Giving the signal then to rest themselves ,</l>
     <l n="239">Now from their armed dance , Waltari plac 'd</l>
     <l n="240">A wreath of verdant oak leaves on his head ,</l>
     <l n="241">And all his men who saw it , did the same .</l>
     <l n="242">And thus triumphantly they did return ,</l>
     <l n="243">Each to his sep'rate home , with gladsome heart .</l>
     <l n="244">And to Attila 's palace , Walter went ,</l>
     <l n="245">Riding but slowly , like a weary man .</l>
     <l n="246">But when the servants saw him thus approach ,</l>
     <l n="247">With eager , curious looks , they hurried forth ,</l>
     <l n="248">And seizing his good palfrey by the reins</l>
     <l n="249">They bade him welcome ; offering their help</l>
     <l n="250">To rest him after all his past fatigues ,</l>
     <l n="251">And putting questions to him ‘ bout the war ,</l>
     <l n="252">And if their arms were crown 'd with victory .</l>
     <l n="253">But scanty answers to these quests he made ;</l>
     <l n="254">Then entering the hall he found Hildgund ,</l>
     <l n="255">Who blushingly receiv 'd his proffer 'd kiss ,</l>
     <l n="256">Then hurried off to fetch a cup of wine ,</l>
     <l n="257">To still his thirst , after so much fatigue .</l>
     <l n="258">Long was the draught he took , for as the earth</l>
     <l n="259">Gladly absorbs the rain after long drought ,</l>
     <l n="260">So did the wine refresh his parched tongue .</l>
     <l n="261">Then , clasping the fair maiden 's hand in his ,</l>
     <l n="262">For both knew well that they were long betroth 'd ,</l>
     <l n="263">He thus spoke out before the blushing maid :</l>
     <l n="264">“ Many a year has softly glided by ,</l>
     <l n="265">Whilst in captivity we long 'd for home ,</l>
     <l n="266">For though the cage that holds us , be of gold ,</l>
     <l n="267">‘ Tis still a cage , and ne'er can I forget ,</l>
     <l n="268">The ancient promise , which made thee my bride ,</l>
     <l n="269">In times of freedom , ere the Huns had come . ”</l>
     <l n="270">These words , like fiery arrows found their way ,</l>
     <l n="271">Into the ears of Hildgund , who to try ,</l>
     <l n="272">The faith and truthfulness of him who spoke ,</l>
     <l n="273">With tearful voice , and flashing eye replied :</l>
     <l n="274">“ How darest thou dissemble thy true thoughts ,</l>
     <l n="275">For ne'er thy heart did feel , what says thy mouth ,</l>
     <l n="276">For thy proud heart is set on nobler game ,</l>
     <l n="277">Than the poor maiden , whom thou mockest now . ”</l>
     <l n="278">With steady eyes , that gaz 'd a half reproach ,</l>
     <l n="279">The valiant hero thus his speech resum 'd :</l>
     <l n="280">“ Far be deceit and falsehood from my lips ,</l>
     <l n="281">Which never yet have utter 'd one false word ,</l>
     <l n="282">And verily thou know'st I love thee well ,—</l>
     <l n="283">And if I , in thy woman 's soul could read</l>
     <l n="284">I fain would tell thee something , secretly ,</l>
     <l n="285">Whilst not a spying ear is list'ning near . ”</l>
     <l n="286">Fully convinc 'd of having wrong 'd her knight ,</l>
     <l n="287">Hildgunde , weeping fell upon her knees ,</l>
     <l n="288">“ Go where thou wilt , and I will follow thee ,</l>
     <l n="289">Through grief and dangers , until Death us part . ”</l>
     <l n="290">With gentle words and loving arms he rais 'd</l>
     <l n="291">The weeping maiden ; saying all he knew</l>
     <l n="292">To comfort her , and then reveal 'd his plans :</l>
     <l n="293">“ My soul has long been weary of this yoke ,</l>
     <l n="294">And fill 'd with yearning for my fatherland ,</l>
     <l n="295">Yet never would I go without Hildgund ,</l>
     <l n="296">My own beloved future wife and queen . ”</l>
     <l n="297">And smiling through her tears , Hildgund replied :</l>
     <l n="298">“ My lord , the words thou speakest , I have borne ,</l>
     <l n="299">For many years , a secret in my heart .</l>
     <l n="300">So let us fly then when and how thou wilt ,</l>
     <l n="301">And our love will help us to surmount</l>
     <l n="302">All dangers that may rise in our path . ”</l>
     <l n="303">Then further Walter whisper 'd in her ear :</l>
     <l n="304">“ And as they have entrusted thee with all</l>
     <l n="305">The keys unto their treasures , I would have</l>
     <l n="306">Thee lay aside the armour of the king ,</l>
     <l n="307">His helmet and his sword , a master-piece</l>
     <l n="308">Of foreign workmanship . Then go and fill</l>
     <l n="309">Two chests with gold and jewels to the brim ,</l>
     <l n="310">So that thou scarce canst lift them off the ground .</l>
     <l n="311">Besides , four pair of well-made leathern shoes ,</l>
     <l n="312">— The way is long ,— as many take for thee .</l>
     <l n="313">And from the blacksmith fetch some fishing hooks</l>
     <l n="314">So that the lakes and rivers which we pass ,</l>
     <l n="315">May yield us fish , for our support and cheer .</l>
     <l n="316">All this a week from this , let be prepar 'd ,</l>
     <l n="317">For then the king will hold a sumptuous feast ,</l>
     <l n="318">And when the wine has sent them all to sleep ,</l>
     <l n="319">We two will fly , away to the far west ! ”</l>
     <l n="320">The hour for the feast had come at last</l>
     <l n="321">And in the hall , bedeck 'd with colours gay ,</l>
     <l n="322">Attila on his throne , in purple clad ,</l>
     <l n="323">Presided o'er the feast ; whilst round about ,</l>
     <l n="324">On couches numberless , the others lay .</l>
     <l n="325">The tables scarce could bear the heavy load ,</l>
     <l n="326">Of all the dishes , pleasant to behold ;</l>
     <l n="327">Whilst from the golden beakers issued forth</l>
     <l n="328">Enticing , fragrant scents of costly wines .</l>
     <l n="329">The meal had now begun . With zealous grace</l>
     <l n="330">Waltari on himself the duty took ,</l>
     <l n="331">To act as host , encouraging the guests ,</l>
     <l n="332">To do full honour to the goodly cheer .</l>
     <l n="333">And when at last their appetites were sooth 'd ,</l>
     <l n="334">And all the tables from the hall remov 'd ,</l>
     <l n="335">Waltari to the king these words address 'd .</l>
     <l n="336">“ And now , my noble lord and king , I beg ,</l>
     <l n="337">To give your gracious leave without delay</l>
     <l n="338">That the carousing to the meal succeed . ”</l>
     <l n="339">Then dropping on his knees , a mighty cup</l>
     <l n="340">Richly adorn 'd with many a picture rare ,</l>
     <l n="341">He thus presented to the king , who said :</l>
     <l n="342">“ Indeed , my good cup-bearer , you mean well ,</l>
     <l n="343">By thus affording me the ample means ,</l>
     <l n="344">To drown my thirst , in this great flood of wine ! ”</l>
     <l n="345">Then laughingly he rais 'd it to his lips ,</l>
     <l n="346">And drank and drank , until the giant cup</l>
     <l n="347">Was emptied to the dregs , and fairly stood</l>
     <l n="348">The nail-test , as no single drop would flow ,</l>
     <l n="349">When upside down the beaker then was turn 'd .</l>
     <l n="350">“ Now , follow my example , all of you ! ”</l>
     <l n="351">The old carouser cried , with cheerful voice .</l>
     <l n="352">And swifter almost than the chased deer ,</l>
     <l n="353">The cup-bearers now hurried through the hall ,</l>
     <l n="354">Filling the cups as soon as they were quaff 'd ,</l>
     <l n="355">Each trying in this tournament of wine ,</l>
     <l n="356">To get the better of his neighbours there .</l>
     <l n="357">Thus in short space of time , many a tongue</l>
     <l n="358">That often utter 'd wise and prudent speech ,</l>
     <l n="359">Began to stammer ,— until by degrees ,</l>
     <l n="360">The wine did conquer e'en the strongest men ;</l>
     <l n="361">So that when midnight came , it found them all ,</l>
     <l n="362">A prey to drunken and besotted sleep .</l>
     <l n="363">With soft and careful voice , Waltari now</l>
     <l n="364">Call 'd to Hildgund , and bidding her prepare ,</l>
     <l n="365">Went to the stable then to fetch his horse ,</l>
     <l n="366">Lion by name , his good and trusty steed</l>
     <l n="367">That stood awaiting him pawing the ground ,</l>
     <l n="368">And with dilating nostrils , bit the reins</l>
     <l n="369">As if impatient to display his strength .</l>
     <l n="370">Then on each side the treasure laden chests</l>
     <l n="371">Were fasten 'd carefully ; some victuals too</l>
     <l n="372">Packed in a basket , had not been forgot .</l>
     <l n="373">First lifting up the maiden in whose hands</l>
     <l n="374">The reins he plac 'd , Waltari follow 'd her ,</l>
     <l n="375">His red-plum 'd helmet towering above</l>
     <l n="376">His massive armour , whose protective strength</l>
     <l n="377">Had stood the test , of many fierce attacks .</l>
     <l n="378">On either side , he wore a trusty sword ,</l>
     <l n="379">Beside a Hunnic sabre , short but sharp ;</l>
     <l n="380">And in his hands both shield and lance he held .</l>
     <l n="381">Thus , well prepar 'd ‘ gainst any chance attack</l>
     <l n="382">Waltari and his bride rode from the halls</l>
     <l n="383">Of Attila for ever — full of joy</l>
     <l n="384">All through the long and darksome night they rode ,</l>
     <l n="385">The maiden taking care to guide the steed ,</l>
     <l n="386">And watch the treasure , holding in her hand</l>
     <l n="387">The fishing-rod , as her companion had</l>
     <l n="388">Enough to do to carry all his arms .</l>
     <l n="389">But when the morning sun cast his first rays ,</l>
     <l n="390">Upon the slumb'ring earth , they left the track ,</l>
     <l n="391">Of the broad highway , turning to the shade</l>
     <l n="392">Of lonely woods , and if the wish for flight</l>
     <l n="393">Had not been stronger in the maiden 's heart ,</l>
     <l n="394">Than fear ,— she fain would have shrunk back ,</l>
     <l n="395">Before the dangers which seem 'd lurking there</l>
     <l n="396">Behind each tree ; and when a branch but mov 'd</l>
     <l n="397">Or when some hidden bird its voice did raise ,</l>
     <l n="398">Her bosom heav 'd , with half suppressed sighs .</l>
     <l n="399">But on they rode , having to find their way ,</l>
     <l n="400">Through pathless woods , and lonely mountain-glens .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="401">Yet still they slept , in that vast banquet hall ,</l>
     <l n="402">Until the sun stood high up in the sky ,</l>
     <l n="403">When Attila , the king , first did awake ,</l>
     <l n="404">And rais 'd his heavy head , clouded with wine ,</l>
     <l n="405">Then slowly rose , and stepping to the door ,</l>
     <l n="406">Call 'd out with drowsy voice : “ Ye men out there ,</l>
     <l n="407">Go find Waltari , quick and bring him here ,</l>
     <l n="408">That he may cheer his king with sprightly talk ,</l>
     <l n="409">Presenting him the welcome morning-cup . ”</l>
     <l n="410">The servants , to obey his order , went</l>
     <l n="411">In all directions , looking here and there ,</l>
     <l n="412">Yet nowhere was Waltari to be found .</l>
     <l n="413">With trembling gait , Dame Ospirin now came ,</l>
     <l n="414">And from afar was heard her scolding voice ,</l>
     <l n="415">“ What in the name of wonder ails Hildgund ,</l>
     <l n="416">That she forgets to bring my morning-gown ? ”</l>
     <l n="417">Then , there arose a whisper ‘ mongst the men ,</l>
     <l n="418">And soon the queen had guess 'd the fatal truth ,</l>
     <l n="419">That both their captives now had taken flight .</l>
     <l n="420">Loud was her grief with which she now exclaim 'd ,</l>
     <l n="421">“ Oh cursed be the banquet , curs 'd the wine</l>
     <l n="422">Which so much mischief in one night has wrought !</l>
     <l n="423">And yet , I who foresaw the coming doom ,</l>
     <l n="424">Unheeded rais 'd my warning voice in vain .</l>
     <l n="425">So now the strongest pillar of support ,</l>
     <l n="426">That propp 'd the throne , Waltari too is gone . ”</l>
     <l n="427">Fierce was the anger which beset the heart</l>
     <l n="428">Of Attila , who tearing his grey locks</l>
     <l n="429">In his impotent rage , could find no words ,</l>
     <l n="430">In which to utter , all that rag 'd within .</l>
     <l n="431">During that day he neither ate nor drank ,</l>
     <l n="432">In gloomy silence brooding o'er his loss ,</l>
     <l n="433">Even at night , his mind could find no rest ,</l>
     <l n="434">For stubborn sleep refus 'd to close his eyes .</l>
     <l n="435">So , tossing restlessly about , he lay</l>
     <l n="436">As if his blood were chang 'd to liquid fire ;</l>
     <l n="437">Then madly starting up , he left his couch</l>
     <l n="438">And pacing his dark chamber up and down ,</l>
     <l n="439">His frantic grief in all his acts display 'd .</l>
     <l n="440">But while in fruitless sorrow , thus the night</l>
     <l n="441">Crept by with stealthy , slowly measured tread ,</l>
     <l n="442">Waltari with his lady-love rode on</l>
     <l n="443">In breathless silence , through the Hunnic lands .</l>
     <l n="444">But when the rising dawn announc 'd the day ,</l>
     <l n="445">King Attila did call the eldest Huns ,</l>
     <l n="446">Whose hoary heads were signs of ripen 'd wit ,</l>
     <l n="447">Around his throne , and then address 'd them thus :</l>
     <l n="448">“ He that shall bring Waltari back to me ,</l>
     <l n="449">That cunning fox who has deserted us ,</l>
     <l n="450">Him I will clothe , in costly golden robes</l>
     <l n="451">And cover him with gifts from head to foot ;</l>
     <l n="452">So that his very feet shall tread on gold . ”</l>
     <l n="453">‘ Twas said in vain , for neither count nor knight</l>
     <l n="454">Nor page nor slave was found in all the land ,</l>
     <l n="455">Who had the courage to pursue a man ,</l>
     <l n="456">Renowned for his valour and his strength ,</l>
     <l n="457">Who never yet had found his match and peer ,</l>
     <l n="458">Whose sword was ever crown 'd with victory .</l>
     <l n="459">Thus all the king could say , was said in vain</l>
     <l n="460">And unavailing were both gold and speech .</l>
     <l n="461">Thus unpursued the lovers onward sped ,</l>
     <l n="462">Trav'ling by night and resting in the day ,</l>
     <l n="463">In shady nooks and shelter 'd mountain-glens</l>
     <l n="464">Spending their time in catching birds and fish ,</l>
     <l n="465">To still their hunger , and to drive away</l>
     <l n="466">All idle fancies from their hearts and heads ,</l>
     <l n="467">So that in all this time , the noble knight</l>
     <l n="468">Not once the maiden wanted to embrace .</l>
     <l n="469">Full fourteen times the Sun had pass 'd his round</l>
     <l n="470">Since they had left the halls of Attila ,</l>
     <l n="471">When in the ev'ning light , between the trees</l>
     <l n="472">They saw a sheet of water , flashing bright</l>
     <l n="473">And golden in the sunshine ,— and at last ,</l>
     <l n="474">They gave a joyous welcome to the Rhine ,</l>
     <l n="475">The noble river from whose vine-clad banks</l>
     <l n="476">The stately battlements and lofty towers ,</l>
     <l n="477">Of ancient Worms , Franconia 's capital</l>
     <l n="478">Rose proudly in the air . A ferry-man</l>
     <l n="479">Who then was loitering beside his boat ,</l>
     <l n="480">Row 'd them across , and as a fee receiv 'd</l>
     <l n="481">Some fish which in the Danube had been caught ,</l>
     <l n="482">On that same morning by Waltari 's hook .</l>
     <l n="483">As soon as they had reach 'd the other side</l>
     <l n="484">Waltari spurr 'd his charger to a quicker pace .</l>
     <l n="485">The boatman , the next morning brought the fish</l>
     <l n="486">Unto the royal cook , who gladly took</l>
     <l n="487">The foreign ware ; which , daintily prepar 'd</l>
     <l n="488">He serv 'd that very day at the king 's board .</l>
     <l n="489">Full of surprise King Gunther look 'd at them ,</l>
     <l n="490">Then turning to his guests he said aloud ,</l>
     <l n="491">“ In all the time that in Franconia , I</l>
     <l n="492">Have sat upon the throne , I ne'er did see ,</l>
     <l n="493">A fish like these , amongst the goodly fare</l>
     <l n="494">Upon my table ; therefore tell me quick</l>
     <l n="495">My worthy cook , whence these fair fish may come ? ”</l>
     <l n="496">The cook denounc 'd the boatman , who was fetch 'd</l>
     <l n="497">And to the questions put , thus did reply :</l>
     <l n="498">“ As I was sitting by the riverside</l>
     <l n="499">Just as the sun was slowly gliding down</l>
     <l n="500">Behind the hills ,— the eve of yesterday ,</l>
     <l n="501">A foreign rider , in full armour came</l>
     <l n="502">Out from the woods , looking so proud and bold</l>
     <l n="503">As if he then and there , came from the wars ;</l>
     <l n="504">And though his armour was not light I trow</l>
     <l n="505">He yet did spur his horse to hurry on ,</l>
     <l n="506">As if by unseen enemies pursued .</l>
     <l n="507">Behind him , on the selfsame steed , a maid</l>
     <l n="508">Fair as the sun , was seated , whose small hands</l>
     <l n="509">Did guide the animal , whose wondrous strength ,</l>
     <l n="510">I had full leisure to observe the while .</l>
     <l n="511">Besides this double freight of man and maid ,</l>
     <l n="512">It bore two caskets , fasten 'd to its sides ,</l>
     <l n="513">Which , as it shook its arched neck , gave forth</l>
     <l n="514">A ringing , clinking sound of precious gold .</l>
     <l n="515">This man I row 'd across , and got the fish</l>
     <l n="516">Instead of copper payment , from his hands . ”</l>
     <l n="517">As soon as he had ended , Hagen cried</l>
     <l n="518">“ My friends , I bid ye all rejoice with me !</l>
     <l n="519">For surely ‘ tis my friend Waltari , who</l>
     <l n="520">Now from the Huns has like myself escap 'd . ”</l>
     <l n="521">Loud were the shouts of joy , which from all sides ,</l>
     <l n="522">Did greet this welcome news ; but full of greed</l>
     <l n="523">King Gunther , when the tumult had decreas 'd ,</l>
     <l n="524">With cunning speech , the company address 'd .</l>
     <l n="525">“ I also , my good friends , bid you rejoice</l>
     <l n="526">With me , that I have liv 'd to see the day ,</l>
     <l n="527">When the fair treasure , which my father gave</l>
     <l n="528">Unto the Huns ,— a kindly providence</l>
     <l n="529">Has now sent back , and never be it said ,</l>
     <l n="530">That I had fail 'd to profit by my luck . ”</l>
     <l n="531">Thus Gunther spoke , nor did he tarry long ,</l>
     <l n="532">But choosing from his knights , twelve of the best ,</l>
     <l n="533">He bade them mount , and follow in this quest ,</l>
     <l n="534">On which his heart and soul was madly fix 'd .</l>
     <l n="535">In vain did Hagen , faithful to his friend ,</l>
     <l n="536">Bid him beware , and try to turn his thoughts ,</l>
     <l n="537">To better aims ,— his words did not avail ;</l>
     <l n="538">For avarice and lust of gold had made</l>
     <l n="539">Their fatal entrance into Gunther 's heart .</l>
     <l n="540">So from the gates of Worms , the well-arm 'd troop</l>
     <l n="541">Rode onwards , following Waltari 's track .</l>
     <l n="542">Meanwhile Waltari and his gentle bride</l>
     <l n="543">Had enter 'd a dark wood , where mighty trees</l>
     <l n="544">Were giving shade and shelter from the heat .</l>
     <l n="545">Two rugged hills extended their steep peaks ,</l>
     <l n="546">In stern and gloomy grandeur heavenwards ;</l>
     <l n="547">A cool and shelter 'd ravine lay between ,</l>
     <l n="548">Blocked up by narrow walls of sandy rocks .</l>
     <l n="549">And cradled in a nest of trees and grass ,</l>
     <l n="550">A very den for robbers , hard to take ,</l>
     <l n="551">Which they no sooner spied , than Walter said ,</l>
     <l n="552">“ Here let us rest my love ! For many nights</l>
     <l n="553">My eyes have tasted neither rest nor sleep . ”</l>
     <l n="554">Then taking off his armour , he lay down</l>
     <l n="555">Resting his head upon the maiden 's lap .</l>
     <l n="556">And further he continued : “ while I sleep .</l>
     <l n="557">My own beloved , keep a careful look</l>
     <l n="558">Into the valley , and if but a cloud</l>
     <l n="559">Of dust were rising in the distance , mind</l>
     <l n="560">To wake me with a soft and gentle touch</l>
     <l n="561">Of thy dear fingers . Do not startle me</l>
     <l n="562">All of a sudden , even though a host</l>
     <l n="563">Of enemies were coming at a time .</l>
     <l n="564">I fully trust thy loving eyes , ” — and thus</l>
     <l n="565">He clos 'd his own and soon was fast asleep .</l>
     <l n="566">Meanwhile King Gunther 's greedy eye had spied ,</l>
     <l n="567">The footprints of a solitary horse ,</l>
     <l n="568">And with exulting joy he cried aloud :</l>
     <l n="569">“ Come on my faithful vassals ! Ere the sun</l>
     <l n="570">Has sunk behind those hills , we shall have ta'en</l>
     <l n="571">Waltari with his stolen gold , I trow . ”</l>
     <l n="572">His face o'ershadow ' d by a darkling cloud</l>
     <l n="573">Prince Hagen said : “ Believe me noble king , ’</l>
     <l n="574">That not so lightly you will vanquish him .</l>
     <l n="575">Oft did I see how valiant heroes fell ,</l>
     <l n="576">Stretch 'd to the ground by Walter 's goodly sword ,</l>
     <l n="577">Which never miss 'd its mark , nor found the man</l>
     <l n="578">Who was his match in all the warlike arts . ”</l>
     <l n="579">Unheeded fell these words on Gunther 's ear ,</l>
     <l n="580">And in the heat of noon , they reach 'd the glen ,</l>
     <l n="581">Which as a stronghold nature had array 'd .</l>
     <l n="582">With wakeful eyes , Hildgunde kept her watch ,</l>
     <l n="583">When suddenly she saw a cloud of dust</l>
     <l n="584">Rise in the distance , and could hear the tramp</l>
     <l n="585">Of swift approaching horses . So she laid</l>
     <l n="586">Her lily fingers on Waltari 's hair ,</l>
     <l n="587">And whisper 'd in his ear : “ awake my love ,</l>
     <l n="588">For I can see a troop of armed men ;</l>
     <l n="589">Their shields and lances glisten in the sun . ”</l>
     <l n="590">And from his drowsy eyes he rubb 'd the sleep ,</l>
     <l n="591">Then hastily he seiz 'd his sword and shield ,</l>
     <l n="592">Put on the armour , and thus stood prepar 'd</l>
     <l n="593">For bloody fight , which was to follow soon .</l>
     <l n="594">But when Hildgunde saw the knights approach ,</l>
     <l n="595">She threw herself despairing on the ground ,</l>
     <l n="596">And with a wailing voice she cried aloud :</l>
     <l n="597">“ Ah woe is me ! the Huns are coming here !</l>
     <l n="598">But rather than return a prisoner</l>
     <l n="599">A second time ,— I prythee my dear lord ,</l>
     <l n="600">To kill me with thy sword ;— so that if I ,</l>
     <l n="601">Shall never live to be thy wife , no man</l>
     <l n="602">Shall dare to make me his reluctant bride . ”</l>
     <l n="603">With soothing words , Waltari then replied :</l>
     <l n="604">“ Be calm my own , and banish needless fear .</l>
     <l n="605">For He , who was my help in former plight ,</l>
     <l n="606">Will not desert me in my sorest need .</l>
     <l n="607">These are no Huns my darling ! Silly boys ,</l>
     <l n="608">Not knowing what the danger they provoke ,</l>
     <l n="609">In youthful wantonness of stubborn pride . ”</l>
     <l n="610">Then , with a merry laugh he cried aloud :</l>
     <l n="611">“ Forsooth , look yonder , if I do n't mistake</l>
     <l n="612">That man is Hagen my alien friend ! ”</l>
     <l n="613">Then stepping to the entrance of the gorge ,</l>
     <l n="614">The hero boldly utter 'd this proud speech :</l>
     <l n="615">“ I tell ye that not one Franconian man ,</l>
     <l n="616">Shall bring the tidings home unto his wife</l>
     <l n="617">That , living , he had touch 'd Waltari 's gold ,</l>
     <l n="618">And , ” — but he did not end the haughty speech ,</l>
     <l n="619">But falling on his knees he humbly ask 'd ,</l>
     <l n="620">God 's pardon for his own presumptuousness .</l>
     <l n="621">Anon he rose , and letting his keen eye</l>
     <l n="622">Glance o'er the ranks of the approaching foes ,</l>
     <l n="623">He said unto himself , “ of all these men</l>
     <l n="624">There is but one of whom I am afraid ;</l>
     <l n="625">And that is Hagen , for I know his strength ;</l>
     <l n="626">And that in cunning tricks , there is no man</l>
     <l n="627">Can claim to be his equal , I believe . ” —</l>
     <l n="628">But whilst Waltari held himself prepar 'd</l>
     <l n="629">Sir Hagen once again did warn the king :</l>
     <l n="630">“ If you would hear my counsel , I advise</l>
     <l n="631">To send some messenger , and try to get</l>
     <l n="632">A peaceful issue ; for maybe that he</l>
     <l n="633">Himself is ready to give up the gold .</l>
     <l n="634">If not , there still is time to draw the sword . ”</l>
     <l n="635">So Gamelo of Metz , a stalwart knight</l>
     <l n="636">Was sent as herald to Waltari then ,</l>
     <l n="637">And soon accosted him , with this demand :</l>
     <l n="638">“ Tell me , oh stranger knight , whence thou dost come ,</l>
     <l n="639">What is thy name , and where thy home may be ? ”</l>
     <l n="640">“ First let me hear , ” Waltari then replied ,</l>
     <l n="641">“ Who is the man , whose orders to obey</l>
     <l n="642">Thou camest hither ? ” And with haughty mien ,</l>
     <l n="643">Sir Gamelo now said : “ Franconia 's king ,</l>
     <l n="644">Gunther by name , has sent me on this quest . ”</l>
     <l n="645">Waltari then resum 'd : “ What does it mean ,</l>
     <l n="646">To stop and question peaceful trav'lers thus ?</l>
     <l n="647">Waltari is my name , of Aquitain</l>
     <l n="648">Whence , as a hostage to King Attila ,</l>
     <l n="649">I once was sent whilst I was yet a boy ;</l>
     <l n="650">And now , full tired of captivity ,</l>
     <l n="651">I 'm turning back to liberty and home . ”</l>
     <l n="652">“ If that is so , ” Sir Gamelo replied ,</l>
     <l n="653">“ I 've come to bid thee , to deliver up</l>
     <l n="654">Thy golden treasure with yon damsel fair</l>
     <l n="655">And thy good steed unto my lord and king ;</l>
     <l n="656">Who , under these conditions , will be pleas 'd ,</l>
     <l n="657">To grant thee life and freedom unimpair 'd . ”</l>
     <l n="658">With anger flashing from his dark-blue eyes</l>
     <l n="659">Waltari when he heard this offer made ,</l>
     <l n="660">Loudly exclaim 'd : “ Think ye that I 'm a fool ?</l>
     <l n="661">How can thy king claim what is not his own</l>
     <l n="662">Commanding me as if he were a God</l>
     <l n="663">And I his wretched slave ? As yet my hands</l>
     <l n="664">Are free and without fetters ,— yet , to prove</l>
     <l n="665">My courtesy unto thy royal lord</l>
     <l n="666">I willingly now offer him herewith</l>
     <l n="667">A hundred bracelets of the purest gold . ”</l>
     <l n="668">With this fair offer , Gamelo return 'd ,</l>
     <l n="669">And Hagen when he heard it , eagerly</l>
     <l n="670">Said to the king : “ oh take what he will give ,</l>
     <l n="671">Lest evil consequences should ensue .</l>
     <l n="672">A fearful dream , which came to me last night ,</l>
     <l n="673">Does fill my soul with an unusual dread</l>
     <l n="674">Of coming ill . I dreamt oh gracious lord ,</l>
     <l n="675">That we together hunted in the wood</l>
     <l n="676">When suddenly a monstrous bear appear 'd</l>
     <l n="677">Attacking you with such wild vehemence ,</l>
     <l n="678">That ere I yet could come to rescue you</l>
     <l n="679">The bear had torn the flesh up to the hip ,</l>
     <l n="680">Of your right leg ; and when with headlong haste ,</l>
     <l n="681">I rais 'd the lance , it struck me with one paw ,</l>
     <l n="682">And scratch 'd my eye out . ” But with proud disdain ,</l>
     <l n="683">The king replied : “ I now see verily ,</l>
     <l n="684">That like thy father , much thou dost prefer ,</l>
     <l n="685">To fight with thy smooth tongue , than with thy sword . ”</l>
     <l n="686">With burning pain and anger Hagen heard</l>
     <l n="687">These bitter words of ill deserved blame .</l>
     <l n="688">Yet , keeping a calm outside he replied :</l>
     <l n="689">“ If that be your opinion I 'll refrain ,</l>
     <l n="690">From joining in this fight against my friend . ”</l>
     <l n="691">So leading out his horse to a near hill ,</l>
     <l n="692">He there sat down to watch the bloody game .</l>
     <l n="693">Then , Gunther turn 'd to Gamelo once more .</l>
     <l n="694">“ Go then , and tell him that we claim the whole .</l>
     <l n="695">And should he still refuse to give it up ,</l>
     <l n="696">I trow that thou art brave and strong enough ,</l>
     <l n="697">To force , and throw him with thy valiant sword . ”</l>
     <l n="698">And eager to obey his king 's demand ,</l>
     <l n="699">Sir Gamelo rode out with joyous speed ;</l>
     <l n="700">And from the distance yet he rais 'd his voice ,</l>
     <l n="701">And cried : “ Halloh , good friend , I bid thee haste ,</l>
     <l n="702">And give the whole of thy fair treasure now ,</l>
     <l n="703">Into my hands , for my good lord and king . ”</l>
     <l n="704">Waltari heard , but did not deign to speak ,—</l>
     <l n="705">So louder yet the knight , approaching him ,</l>
     <l n="706">Repeated the same quest : “ Out with thy gold ! ”</l>
     <l n="707">But now Waltari , losing patience too ,</l>
     <l n="708">Cried out with angry voice : “ Leave off thy noise !</l>
     <l n="709">One verily might think I were a thief ,</l>
     <l n="710">Who from thy king had robb 'd the treasure here ,</l>
     <l n="711">Say , did I come to you with hostile mind ,</l>
     <l n="712">That thus you treat me like an outlaw 'd man ?</l>
     <l n="713">Did I burn houses ? or destroy the lands ?</l>
     <l n="714">Do other damage ?— that you hunt me down</l>
     <l n="715">Like some obnoxious , hurtful beast of prey ?</l>
     <l n="716">If then to pass your land , one needs must pay ,</l>
     <l n="717">I 'll offer you the double now , to still</l>
     <l n="718">The avarice and greed of your proud king . ”</l>
     <l n="719">But Gamelo , with mocking tone replied .</l>
     <l n="720">“ Yet more than this I trust you 'll offer us ,</l>
     <l n="721">I 'm weary now of talk ,— so guard your life ! ”</l>
     <l n="722">And covering his arm with threefold shield ,</l>
     <l n="723">He threw his lance , which would have struck the mark ,</l>
     <l n="724">If with a subtle movement , Walter had</l>
     <l n="725">Not turn 'd aside , so that it glided past ,</l>
     <l n="726">Full harmless by , to fasten in the ground .</l>
     <l n="727">“ Look out , here comes the answer , ” — with these words ,</l>
     <l n="728">Waltari hurl 'd his spear , which pierc 'd the shield</l>
     <l n="729">Of Gamelo ,— and to his hip did nail</l>
     <l n="730">The luckless hand , which just had miss 'd its aim .</l>
     <l n="731">The wounded knight then letting go his shield ,</l>
     <l n="732">With his remaining hand tried hard to wrench</l>
     <l n="733">The spear out of his side ; but ere he could</l>
     <l n="734">Succeed in his endeavour , Walter 's sword</l>
     <l n="735">Had stabb 'd him to the heart ;— so down he sank ,</l>
     <l n="736">Without a groan into the bloody grass .</l>
     <l n="737">No sooner did his nephew , Scaramund ,</l>
     <l n="738">Behold his uncle 's fall , when loud he cried :</l>
     <l n="739">“ Leave him to me !— for either I will die ,</l>
     <l n="740">Or have revenge for my dear kinsman 's blood ! ”</l>
     <l n="741">So on he gallop 'd , up the narrow path</l>
     <l n="742">That to Waltari 's rocky fortress led ,</l>
     <l n="743">Gnashing his teeth with inward fury , that</l>
     <l n="744">Could find no other vent , he cried aloud :</l>
     <l n="745">“ I have not come , to fight for thy mean gold ,</l>
     <l n="746">But I will have revenge for him who fell</l>
     <l n="747">Before my very eyes ,— slain by thy hand . ”</l>
     <l n="748">But with unruffled calm Waltari spoke ,</l>
     <l n="749">“ If mine the fault of that , which caus 'd the death</l>
     <l n="750">Of him thou call'st thy uncle ,— may I fall</l>
     <l n="751">Pierc 'd to the heart by thy own lance or sword . ”</l>
     <l n="752">Scarce had he ended , when in hasty speed ,</l>
     <l n="753">That work 'd its own destruction , Scaramund</l>
     <l n="754">Had thrown his lances both ; and one was caught ,</l>
     <l n="755">By Walter 's shield , whilst far beyond the mark ,</l>
     <l n="756">The second in some mighty oak stuck fast .</l>
     <l n="757">With naked sword , in blind and furious wrath ,</l>
     <l n="758">He then bore down upon his enemy ,</l>
     <l n="759">To split his head with one resounding blow ,</l>
     <l n="760">Which made the sparks flash forth indignantly ,—</l>
     <l n="761">But could not pierce Waltari 's cap of steel ;</l>
     <l n="762">A very masterpiece of workmanship .</l>
     <l n="763">Before the echo of this mighty blow</l>
     <l n="764">Had died away , Waltari 's spear had thrown</l>
     <l n="765">The rider to the ground ; and though he ask 'd ,</l>
     <l n="766">For mercy , ‘ twas too late ; for with one cut</l>
     <l n="767">His head was sever 'd from his trunk , and thus</l>
     <l n="768">He shar 'd the doom , that he could not revenge ;</l>
     <l n="769">And with his uncle , shar 'd an early grave .</l>
     <l n="770">“ Forwards ! ” was Gunther 's cry , “ and do n't desist ,</l>
     <l n="771">Before the worn out man shall render up</l>
     <l n="772">Both life and gold ! ” — Then Werinhard rode forth ,</l>
     <l n="773">To try his chance against yon fearful man .</l>
     <l n="774">He was no friend of lances ;— all his skill</l>
     <l n="775">Lay in his bow ,— and from the distance he</l>
     <l n="776">Sent many an arrow ‘ gainst his stalwart foe .</l>
     <l n="777">But he , well cover 'd by his massive shield</l>
     <l n="778">Took ample care , not to expose himself ;</l>
     <l n="779">So that , before Sir Werinhard came near ,</l>
     <l n="780">His quiver had been emptied , all in vain ;</l>
     <l n="781">And full of anger at this first defeat</l>
     <l n="782">He now rush 'd forward with his naked sword .</l>
     <l n="783">“ And if my arrows are too light for thee ,</l>
     <l n="784">Then let me see what this my sword will do ! ”</l>
     <l n="785">“ Long have I waited here impatiently ,</l>
     <l n="786">For thy approach , ” Waltari made reply ,</l>
     <l n="787">And like a flash of lightning his good spear</l>
     <l n="788">Flew through the air , the harbinger of death ;</l>
     <l n="789">Missing Sir Werinhard , it hit the horse ,</l>
     <l n="790">Which rearing backwards in its agony</l>
     <l n="791">Threw off its rider , and then fell on him ,</l>
     <l n="792">And ere Sir Werinhard could raise himself ,</l>
     <l n="793">Waltari 's hand had seiz 'd his yellow locks ;</l>
     <l n="794">Stern and relentlessly he did the same</l>
     <l n="795">For him as for the others , and his head</l>
     <l n="796">Fell to the ground , where his companions lay</l>
     <l n="797">But Gunther still was loth to quit the fight ,</l>
     <l n="798">So , as fourth combatant , came Ekkefried</l>
     <l n="799">He who had slain the duke of Saxony</l>
     <l n="800">And liv 'd an outlaw since , at Gunther 's court .</l>
     <l n="801">Proudly he sat upon his red roan steed ;</l>
     <l n="802">And ere for serious fight he did prepare ,</l>
     <l n="803">With taunting word and mocking speech he tried ,</l>
     <l n="804">To rouse Waltari from his outward calm .</l>
     <l n="805">“ Say , art thou human , or some imp of hell</l>
     <l n="806">Who with his magic tricks , by demons taught ,</l>
     <l n="807">Has thrown and vanquish 'd better men than he ?</l>
     <l n="808">But now , believe me they will be aveng 'd ! ”</l>
     <l n="809">But he , with a contemptuous laugh replied :</l>
     <l n="810">“ Forsooth I know the meaning of such stuff ,</l>
     <l n="811">And am not frightened by thy idle boasts .</l>
     <l n="812">Come on , and I will teach thee my dark tricks ,</l>
     <l n="813">And prove my being master of my art ! ”</l>
     <l n="814">“ I will not keep thee waiting ,— so beware ! ”</l>
     <l n="815">And with these words , the Saxon Ekkefried ,</l>
     <l n="816">With dext'rous hand , his iron spear did throw ,</l>
     <l n="817">Which striking ‘ gainst Waltari 's shield was broke</l>
     <l n="818">To pieces , like some wand of brittle glass .</l>
     <l n="819">And with another laugh , Waltari cried :</l>
     <l n="820">“ Take back thy present , and I warrant thee</l>
     <l n="821">Thou'lt find the goblin knows to hit the mark ! ”</l>
     <l n="822">— A moment later , and his fearful spear ,</l>
     <l n="823">Cleaving the shield , had pierc 'd unto the heart</l>
     <l n="824">Of Ekkefried , granting a speedy death .</l>
     <l n="825">And as his lawful prize Waltari led</l>
     <l n="826">His goodly horse away unto the spot</l>
     <l n="827">Where Hildgund ’ still was watching anxiously .</l>
     <l n="828">The fifth who came to undertake the fight ,</l>
     <l n="829">Hadwart by name , had only brought his sword ,</l>
     <l n="830">With which he hoped to kill this dreadful foe .</l>
     <l n="831">And to the king , he said before he went :</l>
     <l n="832">“ If this my sword , should be victorious ,</l>
     <l n="833">I prithee , let we have Waltari 's shield ! ”</l>
     <l n="834">Spurring his horse , he rode unto the spot ,</l>
     <l n="835">Where the dead corpses lay blocking the path ;</l>
     <l n="836">So , jumping to the ground , he cried aloud :</l>
     <l n="837">“ Come out then from thy corner , thou sly rogue ,</l>
     <l n="838">Who like a false envenom 'd snake dost lie</l>
     <l n="839">In ambush , hoping thus to save thy life ,</l>
     <l n="840">Which I am come to take with my good sword .</l>
     <l n="841">And as thy dainty , many-colour 'd shield</l>
     <l n="842">Will be my booty , I command thee now ,</l>
     <l n="843">To lay it down , lest it might damag 'd be .</l>
     <l n="844">And if it were decreed that I should fall ,</l>
     <l n="845">Thou never wilt escape with thy base life ;</l>
     <l n="846">As my companions will avenge my death . ”</l>
     <l n="847">With calm composure , Walter , thus replied :</l>
     <l n="848">“ Indeed , I would not want my trusty shield ,</l>
     <l n="849">Which more than once to-day has sav 'd my life .</l>
     <l n="850">Without that shield , I should not now stand here . ”</l>
     <l n="851">“ Then wait , and see me take it ! ” Hadwart cried ,</l>
     <l n="852">“ Thy steed , and aye , thy rose-cheek 'd damsel too ,</l>
     <l n="853">Will soon be mine ! Come out then , my brave sword ! ”</l>
     <l n="854">Then there began a fighting , as the like ,</l>
     <l n="855">Had ne'er been seen before in yonder wood ;</l>
     <l n="856">So that with wonder and amazement those</l>
     <l n="857">Franconians stood , and looked on the while .</l>
     <l n="858">At last , to end the combat with one stroke ,</l>
     <l n="859">Hadwart dealt such a blow , as must have fell 'd ,</l>
     <l n="860">Waltari to the ground , if with his spears</l>
     <l n="861">The blow he had not parried , and anon</l>
     <l n="862">He wrench 'd the weapon out of Hadwart 's hand</l>
     <l n="863">And threw it far away over his head .</l>
     <l n="864">In ignominious flight Sir Hadwart then</l>
     <l n="865">Tried hard to save his life , but Alphers ’ son ,</l>
     <l n="866">With swifter feet did follow on his heels ;</l>
     <l n="867">“ Stop yet a while , thou hast forgot thy shield ! ”</l>
     <l n="868">And with these words , he rais 'd the iron lance ;</l>
     <l n="869">And struck it through Sir Hadwart 's corselet , so</l>
     <l n="870">That as he fell , he pinn 'd him to the ground .</l>
     <l n="871">The sixth who volunteer 'd his chance to take</l>
     <l n="872">Was Hagen 's nephew , young Sir Patavid .</l>
     <l n="873">On seeing him prepar 'd to meet his doom ,</l>
     <l n="874">His uncle feeling pity with the lad ,</l>
     <l n="875">With persuasive speech tried hard to turn</l>
     <l n="876">His daring fancy from this bold endeavour ,</l>
     <l n="877">“ Oh , nephew , see how death is lurking there ,</l>
     <l n="878">And do not waste your fresh and youthful life</l>
     <l n="879">Against yon man , whom you will conquer not . ”</l>
     <l n="880">But Patavid not heeding this advice ,</l>
     <l n="881">Fearlessly went , spurr 'd by ambitious pride .</l>
     <l n="882">With mournful heart Sir Hagen sat apart ,</l>
     <l n="883">And heaving a deep sigh he spoke these words :</l>
     <l n="884">“ Oh ever greedy youth ! oh baneful thirst of gold ,</l>
     <l n="885">I wish that hell would gather all her golden dross ,</l>
     <l n="886">And set the dragons to watch over it ,</l>
     <l n="887">Instead of tempting wretched human souls</l>
     <l n="888">Into perdition . There 's none has got enough ,</l>
     <l n="889">And to gain more , they risk their very lives</l>
     <l n="890">And souls into the bargain . Wretched fools !</l>
     <l n="891">That dig and toil and scrape , and do not see</l>
     <l n="892">That they are often digging their own grave ,</l>
     <l n="893">Beside which death stands grinning . Say , what news</l>
     <l n="894">Shall I take back to greet thy mother 's ears ,</l>
     <l n="895">And thy poor wife , who waits for thy return ? ”</l>
     <l n="896">And as he thought of her despairing grief ,</l>
     <l n="897">A solitary tear would trickle down :</l>
     <l n="898">“ Farewell , farewell for ever , nephew mine ! ”</l>
     <l n="899">He cried in broken accents , which the winds</l>
     <l n="900">Did carry off unto Waltari 's ear ,</l>
     <l n="901">Whose heart was touch 'd by his old friend 's complaint ,</l>
     <l n="902">And thus address 'd the bold , tho ’ youthful knight :</l>
     <l n="903">“ I warn thee , my brave lad , to spare thy strength ,</l>
     <l n="904">For other deeds and not to risk the fate ,</l>
     <l n="905">Of those who came before thee ,— stalwart knights ,</l>
     <l n="906">For I should grieve to lay thee by their side . ”</l>
     <l n="907">“ My death does not regard thee ; come and fight ,</l>
     <l n="908">Forsooth , I did not come for idle talk , ” —</l>
     <l n="909">Was Patavid 's reply , and as he spoke ,</l>
     <l n="910">His whizzing spear came flying through the air .</l>
     <l n="911">But by Waltari 's own ‘ twas beaten off ,</l>
     <l n="912">With such a mighty stroke , that e'en before the feet ,</l>
     <l n="913">Of fair Hildgund it fell , close by the cave .</l>
     <l n="914">A cry of fear escaped from her lips .</l>
     <l n="915">Then , from her rock , she anxiously look 'd forth</l>
     <l n="916">To see whether her knight still kept the ground ,</l>
     <l n="917">Another time he rais 'd his warning voice</l>
     <l n="918">Bidding his enemy desist from further fight ,</l>
     <l n="919">Who , heedless of these words , still forward press 'd</l>
     <l n="920">With naked sword in hand , hoping to fell</l>
     <l n="921">Waltari with one strong and dext'rous blow .</l>
     <l n="922">But he , bent down his head , so that the sword</l>
     <l n="923">Not meeting with resistance , cut the air</l>
     <l n="924">And dragged him who held it to the ground ;</l>
     <l n="925">And ere that he could rise , Waltari 's sword</l>
     <l n="926">Had dealt the death-blow with unsparing hand .</l>
     <l n="927">Quick to avenge his friend , Sir Gerwig now</l>
     <l n="928">Did spur his noble steed , which with one bound</l>
     <l n="929">Jump 'd o'er the bodies that block 'd up the way .</l>
     <l n="930">And ere Waltari yet could free his sword ,</l>
     <l n="931">From his last foe , Sir Gerwig 's battle-axe</l>
     <l n="932">— The fav'rite weapon of Franconians then</l>
     <l n="933">Flew through the air , a fearful sight to see .</l>
     <l n="934">Quicker than thought Waltari seiz 'd his shield</l>
     <l n="935">To guard himself ,— and with one backward bound</l>
     <l n="936">Took up his trusty lance , and thus prepar 'd ,</l>
     <l n="937">Unflinching stood , awaiting the attack .</l>
     <l n="938">No single word was said on either side ;</l>
     <l n="939">Each thirsted for the fight with hungry soul ;</l>
     <l n="940">One to avenge the death of his dear friend ,</l>
     <l n="941">The other to defend his life and gold ,</l>
     <l n="942">And her he valued more , far more than both .</l>
     <l n="943">Full long they fought with unrelenting zeal</l>
     <l n="944">A well-match 'd pair , until Waltari 's lance</l>
     <l n="945">Lifting the shield of his antagonist ,</l>
     <l n="946">Did find its way into his corselet ;</l>
     <l n="947">And with a hollow groan he reeled back</l>
     <l n="948">Expiring on the spot where he fell down .</l>
     <l n="949">With fear and wonder , the Franconians saw ,</l>
     <l n="950">Waltari 's prowess , and their friend 's defeat ;</l>
     <l n="951">So that at last they all besought the king</l>
     <l n="952">To cease from further fight ; but he replied :</l>
     <l n="953">“ Ah well , indeed , I never would have thought</l>
     <l n="954">To find such weak and craven-hearted men</l>
     <l n="955">Amongst my knights that I deem 'd brave before .</l>
     <l n="956">What ! does misfortune make your spirits fail ,</l>
     <l n="957">Instead of raising them to boiling heat ?</l>
     <l n="958">And do you mean to say we should return</l>
     <l n="959">Conquer 'd and beaten by one single man ?</l>
     <l n="960">Nay , if before I only wish 'd to have</l>
     <l n="961">The stranger 's gold , I now will have his life !</l>
     <l n="962">The blood which he has shed , does cry for blood ! ”</l>
     <l n="963">He ceas 'd and at his words , new courage fill 'd</l>
     <l n="964">The hearts of his brave knights , so that now each</l>
     <l n="965">Would be the first to try the bloody game ,</l>
     <l n="966">And in a file they now rode up the path .</l>
     <l n="967">Meanwhile , Waltari there to cool his brow ,</l>
     <l n="968">Had ta'en his helmet off , and hung it up</l>
     <l n="969">On the strong branch of a tall stately oak ;</l>
     <l n="970">And as the fragrant breezes cool 'd his brow</l>
     <l n="971">He felt new strength and vigour in his limbs ,</l>
     <l n="972">But while he thus stood breathing the fresh air ,</l>
     <l n="973">Sir Randolf on his fiery steed advanc 'd</l>
     <l n="974">And came upon him with such sudden speed ,</l>
     <l n="975">That with his iron bar quite unawares</l>
     <l n="976">He would have pierc 'd Waltari where he stood</l>
     <l n="977">If that the armour which did shield his breast ,</l>
     <l n="978">Had not been forg 'd by Weland 's dext'rous hands ,</l>
     <l n="979">And thus resisted Randolf 's fierce assault .</l>
     <l n="980">Not having time to don his cap of steel ,</l>
     <l n="981">He seiz 'd his shield as Randolf rais 'd his sword ,</l>
     <l n="982">And dealt a cut , which , grazing Walter 's head ,</l>
     <l n="983">Cut off some locks of his abundant hair .</l>
     <l n="984">The second blow now struck against the edge</l>
     <l n="985">Of Walter 's shield , with such fierce vehemence</l>
     <l n="986">That it stuck fast , and ere that he could wrench</l>
     <l n="987">It from this prison-hold , Waltari 's hand</l>
     <l n="988">Had dragg 'd him from the saddle to the ground ,</l>
     <l n="989">“ Ha ! ” cried he , “ thou shalt pay for my shorn locks ,</l>
     <l n="990">With thine own pate ! ” and as he said the words ,</l>
     <l n="991">Sir Randolf 's head lay bleeding on the ground .</l>
     <l n="992">The ninth who now rode up in furious haste</l>
     <l n="993">Was Helmnod , bearing neither sword nor lance ,</l>
     <l n="994">But on a long and twisted cord instead</l>
     <l n="995">A heavy trident set with many spikes .</l>
     <l n="996">And in the rear , his friends held the one end ,</l>
     <l n="997">Of the strong rope , hoping , that when the spikes</l>
     <l n="998">Had taken hold of Walter 's shield , to drag</l>
     <l n="999">Him to the ground with their united force .</l>
     <l n="1000">“ Take care of thy bald head ! ” Sir Helmnod cried ,</l>
     <l n="1001">“ For death is coming towards thee from above ! ”</l>
     <l n="1002">And as he spoke , he threw the curious arms</l>
     <l n="1003">With practis 'd hands ,— nor did he miss the aim .</l>
     <l n="1004">Right in the middle of Waltari 's shield</l>
     <l n="1005">It fix 'd its iron claws , and a loud cry</l>
     <l n="1006">Of joyous exultation fill 'd the air ,</l>
     <l n="1007">As this success was noted by the rest</l>
     <l n="1008">Who now , e'en aided by the king himself ,</l>
     <l n="1009">Pull 'd hard with all their might ,— yet ‘ twas in vain</l>
     <l n="1010">For like some giant-oak he kept the ground</l>
     <l n="1011">Until , wearied at last with such vain sport ,</l>
     <l n="1012">He suddenly let go his faithful shield .</l>
     <l n="1013">So , trusting merely on his coat of mail</l>
     <l n="1014">And his own sword , he madly rush 'd along</l>
     <l n="1015">And with one fearful blow , he split the head</l>
     <l n="1016">And neck of Helmnod , through his cap of steel .</l>
     <l n="1017">Before Sir Trogus yet could free himself</l>
     <l n="1018">From the entangling rope that held him fast ,</l>
     <l n="1019">To fetch his arms which all had laid aside</l>
     <l n="1020">Not to be cumber 'd , as they pull 'd the rope ,</l>
     <l n="1021">Waltari with one slash of his fierce sword</l>
     <l n="1022">Had lam 'd him on both legs , and ta'en his shield ,</l>
     <l n="1023">Before Sir Trogus could stretch out his hand</l>
     <l n="1024">With which he now took up a mighty stone</l>
     <l n="1025">And hurl 'd it with such vigour through the air ,</l>
     <l n="1026">That it did break his own strong shield in twain .</l>
     <l n="1027">Then , crawling onwards through the shelt'ring grass .</l>
     <l n="1028">Sir Trogus stealthily regain 'd his sword ,</l>
     <l n="1029">Which joyfully he rais 'd above his head .</l>
     <l n="1030">His hero 's heart still long 'd to die in fight</l>
     <l n="1031">And so he cried aloud : “ oh , that a friend</l>
     <l n="1032">Were near to help me , or my trusty shield</l>
     <l n="1033">Had not been robb 'd ! I tell thee , haughty knight ,</l>
     <l n="1034">Not thine own bravery , but want of chance</l>
     <l n="1035">Has conquer 'd me . Come on and take my sword ! ”</l>
     <l n="1036">“ Thy wish shall be fulfill 'd ! ” Waltari cried ,</l>
     <l n="1037">And quick as lightning he flew down the path ,</l>
     <l n="1038">Cut off the hand that vainly rais 'd the sword ,</l>
     <l n="1039">So that it fell , a useless member now</l>
     <l n="1040">Unto the ground . But ere the final blow</l>
     <l n="1041">Which was to end his soul 's captivity ,</l>
     <l n="1042">He yet had dealt , Sir Tannast gallop 'd down ,</l>
     <l n="1043">To help his friend in this dread hour of need .</l>
     <l n="1044">Full angrily Waltari turned round ,</l>
     <l n="1045">And with a ghastly wound beneath his arm</l>
     <l n="1046">Sir Tannast fell , bleeding beside his friend ;</l>
     <l n="1047">And murmuring , “ farewell , beloved maid ! ”</l>
     <l n="1048">He breath 'd his last , and with a smile he died .</l>
     <l n="1049">Full of despair , Sir Trogus rais 'd his voice</l>
     <l n="1050">To heap such bitter words and sharp insults</l>
     <l n="1051">Upon Waltari 's head , that he , inflam 'd</l>
     <l n="1052">With angry rage , to stop his sland'rous tongue</l>
     <l n="1053">Now throttled him with his own chain of gold .</l>
     <l n="1054">When all his knights had thus been slain , the king</l>
     <l n="1055">In bitter sorrow fled unto the spot ,</l>
     <l n="1056">Where Hagen sat in gloomy solitude ;</l>
     <l n="1057">And shedding scalding tears of rage and grief ,</l>
     <l n="1058">He tried to touch his heart with subtle speech</l>
     <l n="1059">And thus to rouse him from his apathy .</l>
     <l n="1060">But cold as ice Sir Hagen made reply :</l>
     <l n="1061">“ Full well thou know'st , oh king , that the pale blood ,</l>
     <l n="1062">Which from my fathers I inherited</l>
     <l n="1063">Whose craven hearts would shrink with coward fear</l>
     <l n="1064">When they but heard of war , does hinder me</l>
     <l n="1065">To fight with yonder man . ‘ Tis thy own speech</l>
     <l n="1066">Which now does lame my arm . I cannot fight . ”</l>
     <l n="1067">Again the king tried to appease his wrath</l>
     <l n="1068">Humbling himself , by asking pardon now ,</l>
     <l n="1069">And promising that if he would but fight ,</l>
     <l n="1070">He would reward him amply , ending thus :</l>
     <l n="1071">“ Indeed , I never shall survive the day ,</l>
     <l n="1072">On which the burning shame will be reveal 'd ,</l>
     <l n="1073">When in the streets and high-roads ‘ twill be said ,</l>
     <l n="1074">‘ One single man did kill a host of knights</l>
     <l n="1075">And there was none who would avenge the deed ! ’ ”</l>
     <l n="1076">Still Hagen hesitated , thinking how</l>
     <l n="1077">Waltari once had been his bosom-friend ,</l>
     <l n="1078">His brother almost ,— but when now at last</l>
     <l n="1079">His king and master fell upon his knees ,</l>
     <l n="1080">And with uplifted hands besought his help ,</l>
     <l n="1081">Then the ice melted which had bound his heart</l>
     <l n="1082">In chains of pride and hatred , and he felt ,</l>
     <l n="1083">That if he still refus 'd , his honour would</l>
     <l n="1084">For ever be defil 'd , and so he spoke :</l>
     <l n="1085">“ Whate'er thou biddest me to do , my king ,</l>
     <l n="1086">It shall be done , and what no bribe on earth</l>
     <l n="1087">Could have obtained , the faith I owe to thee ,</l>
     <l n="1088">Has now accomplish 'd ;— but before I try</l>
     <l n="1089">My sword and strength against my quondam friend ,</l>
     <l n="1090">I fain would find some way to drive him from</l>
     <l n="1091">His present stronghold , which does make his strength .</l>
     <l n="1092">For , whilst he keeps that place , ‘ tis certain death</l>
     <l n="1093">To come but near him . Ah , believe me king ,</l>
     <l n="1094">That never even to avenge the death</l>
     <l n="1095">Of my fair nephew , would I raise my hand</l>
     <l n="1096">Against my well-tried friend . Only for thee ,</l>
     <l n="1097">To save thee from the shame of this defeat ,</l>
     <l n="1098">I sacrifice my friendship . Let us hence ,</l>
     <l n="1099">So that , imagining that we were gone ,</l>
     <l n="1100">He too will ride away , suspecting naught ;</l>
     <l n="1101">And in the open field , quite unprepar 'd ,</l>
     <l n="1102">We will attack him ; and I warn thee that</l>
     <l n="1103">The fight will not be easy , even so . ”</l>
     <l n="1104">This cunning plan did please the king so well ,</l>
     <l n="1105">That he embrac 'd Sir Hagen on the spot ,</l>
     <l n="1106">And then they went away to hide themselves ,</l>
     <l n="1107">Leaving their horses grazing in the woods .</l>
     <l n="1108">The sun had disappear 'd behind the hills</l>
     <l n="1109">And now our hero , wearied from the fight ,</l>
     <l n="1110">Stood there , revolving in his inmost heart ,</l>
     <l n="1111">Whether ‘ twere best , to rest and pass the night —</l>
     <l n="1112">In his good stronghold , or to hurry on ,</l>
     <l n="1113">And find his way out of this wilderness .</l>
     <l n="1114">His soul misgave him when he saw the king</l>
     <l n="1115">Kissing Sir Hagen , with exulting mien .</l>
     <l n="1116">Yet , after he had thought of this and that ,</l>
     <l n="1117">He made resolve ‘ twere better to remain ,</l>
     <l n="1118">So that it were not said that he had fled ,</l>
     <l n="1119">Like some base criminal at fall of night .</l>
     <l n="1120">So , cutting down from the surrounding trees</l>
     <l n="1121">And thorny brambles many a branch and bough ,</l>
     <l n="1122">He made himself a strong and solid hedge ,</l>
     <l n="1123">To guard him ‘ gainst an unforeseen attack —</l>
     <l n="1124">With deep-drawn sighs he then walk 'd to the spot ,</l>
     <l n="1125">Where all the corpses lay , his hand had fell 'd ,</l>
     <l n="1126">And putting back each head unto its trunk ,</l>
     <l n="1127">He threw himself down on his knees and prayed :</l>
     <l n="1128">“ Oh Lord of hosts , whom all the world obeys ,</l>
     <l n="1129">Without whose holy will , nothing is done ,</l>
     <l n="1130">I thank Thee , that to-day Thou wert with me</l>
     <l n="1131">Helping me to defeat mine enemies ,</l>
     <l n="1132">Who thirsted all to drink my guiltless blood .</l>
     <l n="1133">Oh Lord whose mighty word destroyeth sin ,</l>
     <l n="1134">Yet taketh pity on us sinners all ,</l>
     <l n="1135">I pray Thee now to show Thy mercy rare ,</l>
     <l n="1136">On these my hand has slain , so that their souls ,</l>
     <l n="1137">May enter all into Thy paradise ,</l>
     <l n="1138">And I may meet them there , when my day comes . ”</l>
     <l n="1139">Thus Walter pray 'd ; then , rising from the ground ,</l>
     <l n="1140">He went to fetch the horses of the dead ,</l>
     <l n="1141">And tied them all together with a cord</l>
     <l n="1142">Made of some willow branches , growing near .</l>
     <l n="1143">Then , taking off his armour , he lay down</l>
     <l n="1144">Upon his shield , to rest his weary limbs ;</l>
     <l n="1145">And speaking tender words unto Hildgund ,</l>
     <l n="1146">He bade her watch his slumbers as before ,</l>
     <l n="1147">For much he needed some refreshing sleep .</l>
     <l n="1148">Thus all the night , the fair and faithful maid</l>
     <l n="1149">Sat by his side , driving the sleep away ,</l>
     <l n="1150">That tried to steal upon her unawares ,</l>
     <l n="1151">By softly singing little bits of song .</l>
     <l n="1152">Before the dawn of day Waltari rose</l>
     <l n="1153">And telling her to sleep now in her turn</l>
     <l n="1154">He paced the ground with calm and even steps ,</l>
     <l n="1155">His lance in hand , ready for an attack .</l>
     <l n="1156">And thus the night wore on , and morning came ;</l>
     <l n="1157">A soft , refreshing mist fell down as dew</l>
     <l n="1158">Hanging in pearly drops on grass and trees .</l>
     <l n="1159">Then , from the corpses with all rev'rent care</l>
     <l n="1160">Waltari took the armours , sword and all ,</l>
     <l n="1161">Leaving their costly dresses though , untouch 'd .</l>
     <l n="1162">Four of the chargers then were laden with</l>
     <l n="1163">His rightful booty , whilst the other two</l>
     <l n="1164">Were destin 'd for himself and his fair bride .</l>
     <l n="1165">Yet ere they started , mounting on a tree ,</l>
     <l n="1166">Waltari with his falcon-eyes survey 'd</l>
     <l n="1167">The scenery around , but seeing nought</l>
     <l n="1168">Which might have rous 'd suspicion , he resolv 'd</l>
     <l n="1169">To wait no more , and thus they now rode forth ,</l>
     <l n="1170">Hildgunde , with the booty-laden steeds</l>
     <l n="1171">Riding ahead , whilst Walter clos 'd the train .</l>
     <l n="1172">Scarce were they gone when Hildgund looking back ,</l>
     <l n="1173">Beheld two stalwart knights approaching fast ,</l>
     <l n="1174">And paling with dismay , she cried aloud :</l>
     <l n="1175">“ Oh dear my Lord ! The end is coming now</l>
     <l n="1176">I pray thee fly , and save thy precious life ! ”</l>
     <l n="1177">Turning his head , Waltari saw the foe</l>
     <l n="1178">And said with tranquil mien : “ no man shall say ,</l>
     <l n="1179">Waltari fled , whilst he could wield the sword !</l>
     <l n="1180">Here , take the reins of King Attila 's horse</l>
     <l n="1181">And save the golden treasure . Yonder wood</l>
     <l n="1182">Will give thee shelter , whilst I will accost</l>
     <l n="1183">The strangers thus , as it becomes a knight . ”</l>
     <l n="1184">The maiden tremblingly obey 'd his words ,</l>
     <l n="1185">Whilst he prepar 'd his trusty lance and shield .</l>
     <l n="1186">Yet from a distance , Gunther called out :</l>
     <l n="1187">“ Now thou no more canst hide between the rocks ,</l>
     <l n="1188">Stand still and let us see , whether the end ,</l>
     <l n="1189">Will not reveal another countenance !</l>
     <l n="1190">And whether fortune is thy hired maid ! ”</l>
     <l n="1191">But with contemptuous mien , Waltari turn 'd</l>
     <l n="1192">His head away , as if he had not heard</l>
     <l n="1193">And looking full in Hagen 's face , he said :</l>
     <l n="1194">“ Oh Hagen , my old friend , what has occurr 'd ,</l>
     <l n="1195">That as an enemy you come to me ?</l>
     <l n="1196">Hast thou forgot the tears which thou hast shed</l>
     <l n="1197">When lying in my arms for the last time ,—</l>
     <l n="1198">That thus thou treatest me , thy faithful friend ?</l>
     <l n="1199">Indeed , I thought the day that we should meet ,</l>
     <l n="1200">Would be a joyous one for thee and me ,</l>
     <l n="1201">And that with open arms , and loving words</l>
     <l n="1202">Thou wouldst accost me . Oh , how oft my heart</l>
     <l n="1203">Would beat with restless longing , when I thought</l>
     <l n="1204">Of thee , so far away , yet still my friend .</l>
     <l n="1205">Hast thou forgotten then our boyish days ,</l>
     <l n="1206">When both did work and strive , for one great aim ,</l>
     <l n="1207">Then , when I look 'd into thine eyes I felt</l>
     <l n="1208">As if my parents and my home were near ,</l>
     <l n="1209">As if I were not quite forsaken yet .</l>
     <l n="1210">And so I kept my love and faith for thee</l>
     <l n="1211">And , therefore , pray thee to depart in peace</l>
     <l n="1212">And as a friendly gift I 'll fill thy shield</l>
     <l n="1213">With gold and jewels even to the brim . ”</l>
     <l n="1214">But with a sombre look and angry voice</l>
     <l n="1215">Sir Hagen to this speech now made reply .</l>
     <l n="1216">“ Indeed , I think , that thou didst break the faith</l>
     <l n="1217">When by thy cruel sword my nephew fell ,</l>
     <l n="1218">His life and not thy gold I claim from thee ,</l>
     <l n="1219">And will hear nought of friendship past and gone . ”</l>
     <l n="1220">Thus speaking he alighted from his horse</l>
     <l n="1221">As likewise did Waltari , and the king ;</l>
     <l n="1222">And so they stood prepar 'd , two against one ,</l>
     <l n="1223">Sir Hagen was the first to break the peace</l>
     <l n="1224">And with an able hand he threw the spear ,</l>
     <l n="1225">Which proudly pierc 'd the air with hissing sound ;</l>
     <l n="1226">But without deigning e'en to turn aside ,</l>
     <l n="1227">Waltari stood extending his good shield ,</l>
     <l n="1228">From which the lance rebounded with such force</l>
     <l n="1229">As if its point had struck against a wall of stone .</l>
     <l n="1230">Then Gunther threw his spear with good intent</l>
     <l n="1231">But with such feeble arm , that it fell down ,</l>
     <l n="1232">Scarce having touch 'd the rim of Walter 's shield .</l>
     <l n="1233">Their lances being gone , both drew the sword ,</l>
     <l n="1234">And with it levell 'd many a well-aim 'd blow</l>
     <l n="1235">Which all were parried by Waltari 's lance .</l>
     <l n="1236">At last an evil thought struck Gunther 's mind ,</l>
     <l n="1237">And whilst Sir Hagen fiercely onward press 'd</l>
     <l n="1238">He stealthily bent down to seize his lance ,</l>
     <l n="1239">But just when he had seized the oaken shaft ,</l>
     <l n="1240">Waltari , throwing bold Sir Hagen back ,</l>
     <l n="1241">Did place his foot on the coveted spear .</l>
     <l n="1242">Full of dismay , the king stood there aghast</l>
     <l n="1243">Not moving hand or foot , so that his life</l>
     <l n="1244">Was sore endanger 'd , when Sir Hagen sprang</l>
     <l n="1245">With deerlike swiftness forwards , shielding him ,</l>
     <l n="1246">So that recovering by slow degrees</l>
     <l n="1247">He once again could join in the attack ,</l>
     <l n="1248">That waged fiercer now than e'er before ;</l>
     <l n="1249">Yet still Waltari stood like some strong rock ,</l>
     <l n="1250">Unmov 'd and calm amidst the breakers roar .</l>
     <l n="1251">But from his eyes shot forth such scathing looks ,</l>
     <l n="1252">And on his brow , in triple sisterhood ,</l>
     <l n="1253">Sat fury , hatred and the fierce desire</l>
     <l n="1254">To die or gain the bloody victory .</l>
     <l n="1255">At last , to Hagen he address 'd these words :</l>
     <l n="1256">“ Oh hawthorn tree ,<span corresp="#note3" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>I do not fear thy prick !</l>
     <l n="1257">And let thy vaunted strength be , what it may ,</l>
     <l n="1258">I mean to wrestle with thee . ” At these words ,</l>
     <l n="1259">He hurl 'd his lance with such unerring aim</l>
     <l n="1260">That part of Hagen 's armour was torn off .</l>
     <l n="1261">Then turning suddenly to Gunther , he</l>
     <l n="1262">With one astounding cut of his good sword ,</l>
     <l n="1263">Did sever the right leg from Gunther 's frame .</l>
     <l n="1264">Half dead , King Gunther fell upon his shield</l>
     <l n="1265">But when Waltari just had rais 'd his arm ,</l>
     <l n="1266">To deal the mortal blow , Sir Hagen saw</l>
     <l n="1267">The peril of his king , and with one bound</l>
     <l n="1268">He threw himself between , so that the sword</l>
     <l n="1269">Fell on his helmet , with a clashing sound</l>
     <l n="1270">And then was shiver 'd into sev'ral bits .</l>
     <l n="1271">With angry frown , Waltari threw the hilt</l>
     <l n="1272">Contemptuously aside , for though of gold ,</l>
     <l n="1273">What could it now avail him ? Then he rais 'd</l>
     <l n="1274">His iron-pointed lance with careless hand</l>
     <l n="1275">But ere he yet had pois 'd it , Hagen 's sword</l>
     <l n="1276">Cut off the hand , which to its enemies</l>
     <l n="1277">Had been so fearful , and so far renown 'd ,—</l>
     <l n="1278">And now lay helpless on the bloody ground .</l>
     <l n="1279">Yet even then , Waltari 's noble heart</l>
     <l n="1280">Thought not of flight , but pressing back his pain ,</l>
     <l n="1281">His left hand grasp 'd the Hunnic scimitar</l>
     <l n="1282">Which still was left him in this hour of need ,</l>
     <l n="1283">And which aveng 'd him , slashing Hagen 's face</l>
     <l n="1284">In such a fearful way , that his right eye</l>
     <l n="1285">Besides six teeth he lost by this one blow .</l>
     <l n="1286">Then both did drop their arms , and thus at last</l>
     <l n="1287">The bloody fight was ended . Both had shown</l>
     <l n="1288">Their strength and valour in an equal way ,</l>
     <l n="1289">And now did part with knightly courtesy .</l>
     <l n="1290">Then , sitting side by side , they staunch 'd their wounds</l>
     <l n="1291">With flowers , until Walter 's ringing voice</l>
     <l n="1292">Had brought the fair Hildgund unto their side ,</l>
     <l n="1293">Who with her gentle hands then dress 'd the wounds .</l>
     <l n="1294">As soon as this was done , Waltari said :</l>
     <l n="1295">“ Now sweet my love , I prythee go and bring</l>
     <l n="1296">For each a cup of wine , for verily</l>
     <l n="1297">I think we have deserv 'd it all to-day .</l>
     <l n="1298">First give the cup to Hagen , my old friend ,</l>
     <l n="1299">Who , like a faithful vassal to his king ,</l>
     <l n="1300">Has fought full valiantly in his behalf ;</l>
     <l n="1301">Next give it me and then the king may drink ,</l>
     <l n="1302">Who least has done , and therefore shall be last . ”</l>
     <l n="1303">The maiden doing as her lord had said ,</l>
     <l n="1304">Stepp 'd up to Hagen , who , though plagued with thirst</l>
     <l n="1305">Refus 'd to drink , before Waltari 's lips</l>
     <l n="1306">Had been refreshed by the cooling draught .</l>
     <l n="1307">And when the pangs of thirst had thus been still 'd</l>
     <l n="1308">The two , who just before had been dread foes ,</l>
     <l n="1309">Now sat together , holding friendly talk ,</l>
     <l n="1310">And jesting gaily as in days gone by .</l>
     <l n="1311">“ In future thou , my friend , ” Sir Hagen said ,</l>
     <l n="1312">“ Must wear a leathern glove , well stuff 'd with wool ,</l>
     <l n="1313">On thy right arm , to make the world believe</l>
     <l n="1314">Thou still hadst got both hands at thy commands ,</l>
     <l n="1315">And at thy right side thou must wear the sword ;</l>
     <l n="1316">But worse than all , when thou wilt clasp thy bride</l>
     <l n="1317">With thy left arm thou must embrace her then ,—</l>
     <l n="1318">In fact all thou wilt do in future life</l>
     <l n="1319">Must awkward be ,— left-handed as they say . ”</l>
     <l n="1320">Briskly Waltari to this jest replied :</l>
     <l n="1321">“ Oh , stop thy railing , poor and one-eyed man</l>
     <l n="1322">For with my left hand here , I yet may kill</l>
     <l n="1323">The boar and stag , which thou no more wilt eat ;</l>
     <l n="1324">And in my fancy I can see thee look ,</l>
     <l n="1325">On friends and foes and all the world awry !</l>
     <l n="1326">But for the sake of our youthful days</l>
     <l n="1327">And ancient friendship , I will counsel thee ,</l>
     <l n="1328">To bid thy nurse make porridge and milk-soups</l>
     <l n="1329">When thou com'st home , such as befit thy state</l>
     <l n="1330">Of toothless incapacity for other food . ” —</l>
     <l n="1331">Thus they renew 'd the friendship of their youth ,</l>
     <l n="1332">And after having rested , laid the king</l>
     <l n="1333">Who suffer 'd greatly , on his horse 's back .</l>
     <l n="1334">And then the two Franconians slowly rode</l>
     <l n="1335">To Worms , from where the day before they came</l>
     <l n="1336">In all the pride of their exulting hearts ,</l>
     <l n="1337">Meanwhile , Waltari and his gentle bride</l>
     <l n="1338">Went on to Aquitania , Walter 's home</l>
     <l n="1339">Where they were both receiv 'd with tears of joy</l>
     <l n="1340">By his old father , who had long despair 'd</l>
     <l n="1341">Of holding in his arms his son again ,</l>
     <l n="1342">Who soon was wedded to fair Hildegund ;</l>
     <l n="1343">And when his father died , for thirty years</l>
     <l n="1344">Waltari sway 'd the sceptre , lov 'd by all .</l>

    <head>CHAPTER XXV .</head>
     <l n="1">The last Echo , and End .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>—— And he has sung bravely , our hermit Ekkehard ; and his Waltari-song is a venerable monument of German spirit ; the first great epic out of the circle of national heroic legends , which , in spite of the destroying rust of ages , was bequeathed undamaged to later generations .— To be sure , other notes have been struck in it than those which the Epigonic poets have hatched in their gilt-edged little books . The spirit of a great , heroic time breathes through it ; wild and awful like the roaring of the tempest in mighty oak-trees . There is a sounding and clinking of swords dashing and splitting of helmets ; whilst but little is heard of gallant speeches and tender wooing , or would-be eloquent dissertations on God and the universe , and Heaven knows what ! All that is shown to us there , is a Titanic fight and Titanic jests ; old knighthood in all its simple sternness ; true , honest , silent love , and genuine open-faced hatred ;— these were the materials for Ekkehard 's epic ; and therefore his work has become grand and mighty , and stands at the portal of German poetry , tall and strong , like one of those iron-clad giants , which the plastic art of later days , loved to place as gate-keepers before the entrance of its palaces .</p>
   <p>He , who by the roughness of ancient , often almost heathenish views , may be affected as by the rude blast on a sea-coast , which is apt to produce a cold in the dress-coat-wearing individual ,— will be pleased to consider , that the epic has been sung by one who had himself fought with the Huns ; and that he composed it many hundred feet over the valley-regions , whilst his curls were being ruffled by the wind which had swept over the glaciers on the Saentis ; that his mantle was a wolf 's skin , and that a she-bear was his first auditor .</p>
   <p>‘ Tis a pity that the sportive sprites and goblins have ceased this many-a-day to practise their merry art ; otherwise it might not be amiss for many a writer of the present day , if , by invisible hands , he were suddenly carried away from his mahogany table , to the green meadow of the Ebenalp ; up to those heights where the “ old man ” in all his mountain-grandeur , looks into the poet 's manuscript ; where the thunder , with its manifold echoes , rolls through the ravines and glens ; and where the golden-vulture , in proud , lonely circles , rises up to the rainbow . There , a man must either compose something grand , pithy and of large dimensions , or he must penitently fall on his knees , like the prodigal son , and confess before those magnificent scenes of nature , that he has sinned .—</p>
   <p>Our tale is drawing to its close .</p>
   <p>Perhaps some of our readers would be pleased to hear , that Ekkehard , after having completed his song , died a peaceful death . It would verily have been a most touching conclusion , “ how he had reclined before his cavern , with eyes strained towards the Bodensee ; his harp leaning against the rock ; the parchment-roll in his hands ,— and how his heart had broken ! ” — Further , one might have added some fine simile ;— how the poet was consumed by the burning flames of his genius ; like the torch which is burnt to ashes while it gives its light ;— but this touching spectacle , I am sorry to say , Ekkehard did not afford to posterity .</p>
   <p>Genuine poetry makes a man fresh and healthy . So Ekkehard 's cheeks had assumed a brighter colour during his work , and he often experienced a feeling of well-being which made him stretch out his arm , as if he were about to strike down a wolf or bear , with one blow of his fist .</p>
   <p>But when his Waltari had bravely conquered all dangers and deathly wounds ,— then , he gave a shout of delight which made the stalactite walls of his cavern , reecho . The goats in their stable , received a double quantity of herbs that day , and to the goat-boy he gave some silver coins to induce him to descend to Sennwald in the Rhine-valley , there to procure a jug of red wine .</p>
   <p>It was in those days just as it is now , “ libro completo , saltat scriptor pede laeto ; ” when the book is finished , the writer jumps with joy .</p>
   <p>Therefore on that evening he sat on the Ebenalp in the cottage of the old herdsman and they did not spare the jug ; and lastly Ekkehard seized the huge Alpine-horn , and mounting a rock , blew a mighty strain in the direction of the hazy distant Hegau-mountains ; and the notes swelled out loud and triumphantly , as if they wanted to reach the Duchess 's ears , so as to make her step out on her balcony , followed by Praxedis , whom he then would have liked to greet with a laugh .</p>
   <p>“ If I were to come once more into the world , ” he said to his friend the master of the Ebenalp , “ and were to drop down from the sky just where I pleased , I verily believe that I would choose no other spot than the Wildkirchlein . ”</p>
   <p>“ You are not the first man who has been pleased with our residence , ” laughed the old man . “ When brother Gottshalk was still living , five Italian monks once came up to pay him a visit , and they brought some better wine than this with them ; and they jumped and danced , so as to make their habits fly . ‘ Twas only when they went downhill again that they composed their faces into the necessary serious expression , and one of them , before leaving , made a long speech to our goats . ‘ Do n't blab , ye dear goats , ’ he said , ‘ for the Abbot of Novalese need not know anything of our spirits ’ raptures . ’ ”</p>
   <p>“ But now , mountain-brother , I wish you to tell me one thing , and that is what you have been doing all these last days , cowering in your cavern ? I have well observed , that you have drawn many hooks and runes on your asses skin , and I trust that you are not concocting some evil charm , against our flocks or mountains ? Else ” —— a threatening look finished the sentence .</p>
   <p>“ I have merely been writing a song , ” said Ekkehard .</p>
   <p>The herdsman shook his head . “ Writing ! that confounded writing , ” he growled . “ Well ‘ tis none of my business ; and I trow that the high Saentis will still be looking down on our grand-children and great-grandchildren , without their knowing how to guide pen or lead-pencil ; for I shall never believe that writing will do a man any good . Man , if he wants to be God 's likeness , must walk upright on both his feet , whilst he who wants to write , must sit down with a bent and crooked back . So now I ask you whether that is not just the contrary of how God would have if ? Consequently it must be an invention of the Devil . Therefore mountain-brother ,— mind what you are about . And whenever you try that trick again , and I find you cowering down like a marmot in your cavern , and writing , thunder and lightning , then I will exercise my power as Master of the Alps , and I will tear up your parchment-leaves into little bits , so that the wind will scatter them amongst the fir-trees below ! Up here , everything has to be orderly and simple , and I tell you once for all , that we will have nothing to do with new-fangled things ! ”</p>
   <p>“ I promise not to do it again , ” said Ekkehard laughing and holding out his hand .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The brave Master of the Alps had grown warm over the red wine from</l>
     <l n="2">Sennwald .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Thunder and lightning ! ” he continued . “ What after all is the meaning , of writing down a song ? ‘ Tis mere foolery ! There ! Try and write that down if you can . ” And with these words he began to sing some Alpine “ Jodler ” in such rough , unmodulated sounds , that even the sharpest ear would have found some difficulty in discovering a note which could have been rendered by word or writing .</p>
   <p>At the same hour , in a vine-clad summerhouse of the Bishop 's garden at Passau on the Danube , a man , in the first bloom of manhood , was sitting before a stone table . An indescribable subtle expression played round his lips , half hidden by an ample brown beard , whilst luxurious curls fell down from under his velvet cap . His dark eyes followed the characters which his right hand was tracing on a parchment roll . Two fair-haired boys were standing beside his armchair ; curiously peeping over his shoulder . Many a parchment-leaf was already covered with the recital of tempests and battles , and the bloody deaths of valiant heroes ,— and he was now approaching the end . And before long , he laid aside his pen , and took a long and solemn draught of Hungarian wine , out of a pointed goblet .</p>
   <p>“ Is it done ? ” asked one of the boys .</p>
   <p>“ Yes , ‘ tis all finished , ” said the writer , “ how it began , and how it came , and how it ended with sorrow and shame ! ”</p>
   <p>He held out the manuscript to him , and the boys ran away jubilant , to their uncle , Bishop Pilgerim , and showed it to him . “ And thou art in it also , dear uncle , ” they cried . “ ‘ The Bishop with his niece , to Passau then did go . ’ Twice thou art in it ,— and here again a third time ! ”</p>
   <p>Pilgerim the Bishop , then stroked his white beard and said : “ Ye may well rejoice , my dear nephews , that Conrad has written down this tale for you ; and let me tell you that if the Danube streamed with gold for three entire days and nights , ye might not fish up anything more precious than that song , which contains the greatest history the world ever saw . ”</p>
   <p>The scrivener , meanwhile , stood with radiant countenance under the vine-leaves and blooming honeysuckle in the garden , looking at the withered red leaves , which autumn had shaken from the trees , and then he gazed downwards into the soft-flowing Danube , and in his right ear he heard a loud ringing sound ,— for at that very moment , Ekkehard had filled a wooden cup with wine , and spoken thus to the old herdsman : “ I once had a good comrade , for a better one cannot be found anywhere , and his name is Conrad . The love of women , and worldly ambition are all nought , but I shall ever remain the debtor of old and faithful friendship , unto my last dying day . So you must now drink his health with me , and I tell you , he is a man who would please the old Saentis well , if he were here . ”</p>
   <p>And the herdsman had emptied the cup and had said : “ Mountain-brother , I believe you . Long life to him ! ”</p>
   <p>Therefore the man at Passau had felt his ear tingling ; but he did not know the reason thereof . The sound had not yet died out , when the Bishop came towards him , and he was followed by a groom who led a white little mare , which was old and shabby ; and when one looked at it closer , one could see that it was blind on one eye . And the Bishop nodded his head with the pointed mitre and graciously said : “ Master Conrad , that what you have written to please my nephews , shall not be without its reward . My tried battle-horse is yours ! ”</p>
   <p>A faint , half melancholy smile played round Master Conrad 's finely cut lips , whilst he thought : “ Well , it serves me but right . Why did I become a poet ! ” — But aloud , he said : “ May God reward you Sir Bishop ! I hope that you will grant me a few days leave , to rest myself from my work . ”</p>
   <p>Then he caressed the poor old horse , and mounted it without waiting for the answer . And he sat both proudly and gracefully in the saddle , and even persuaded his humble charger to fall into a tolerable canter , so that he soon disappeared .</p>
   <p>“ I would wager my best falcon against a pair of turtle-doves , ” said the elder of the two boys , “ if he is not again riding to Bechelaren to the markgravian castle . He has said many a time , ‘ quite as well as I can bring my gracious master the Bishop into the song , I can also in it erect a memorial to the margravine Gotelinde and her fair daughter . They , after all , will appreciate it most . ’ ”</p>
   <p>Meanwhile , Master Conrad had already passed out of the gate of the Bishop 's town . Casting a longing look into the distance , he began to sing with a clear voice :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Then boldly spoke the minstrel , his voice rang through the air :</l>
     <l n="2">Oh margrave , noble margrave , God gave thee blessing rare</l>
     <l n="3">In giving thee so fair a spouse , and true as she is fair .</l>
     <l n="4">And if I only were a king , and reigned o'er land and sea ,</l>
     <l n="5">To make thy daughter my dear queen , my only wish would be .</l>
     <l n="6">For ne'er a maid more beautiful . ” ...</l>
   </lg>
   <p>... but when he had got so far , a cloud of dust was blown right into his face , so that involuntary tears started into his eyes , and his singing was stopped .</p>
   <p>The lines were out of the work , for which the Bishop had just now rewarded him . It was an epic in the German tongue , and was called , “ The song of the Nibelungen ! ”</p>
   <p>By and bye autumn began , and although the evening-red is more glowing and brilliant then , than in any other part of the year , it is also accompanied by fresh breezes , so that the inhabitants of the Alps get ready to decamp into their lowly dwellings in the valleys , and no wolf 's skin then can prevent a man 's teeth from chattering .</p>
   <p>Fresh snow was glistening on all the peaks around , and was evidently not intending to melt again that year . Ekkehard had preached his last sermon to the herdsmen . After it , Benedicta sauntered past him .</p>
   <p>“ Now ‘ tis all over with our merry-making up here , ” said she , “ for to-morrow man and beast will betake themselves to their winter quarters . Where are you going , mountain-brother ? ”</p>
   <p>The question fell heavily on his heart .</p>
   <p>“ I should like best to remain here , ” said he .</p>
   <p>Benedicta struck up a merry peal of laughter . “ One can well see , that you have not spent a winter up here ; else you would not wish for another . I should like to see you snowed up in your hermitage , with the cold creeping in at every chink and crevice , so as to make you tremble like an aspen leaf , whilst avalanches come thundering down round about you , and the icicles are growing right into your very mouth .... And when you attempt to go down into the valley to fetch some provisions , then the snow blocks up the path as high as a house ; one step and you sink down to the knees ,— a second — traladibidibidib ! and the cowl is all that is left , and one does not see more of you than of a fly that has fallen into a pot of milk . Besides we have had so many great tit-mice this year ,— that means a severe winter . Ugh — how pleasant the long winter-evenings will be ! Then , we sit around the warm stove , and spin by the light of the pine-chips . How the wheels fly about , and the fire crackles , and we relate the most beautiful stories , and all good boys may come and listen . ‘ Tis a pity that you have not become a herdsman , mountain-brother , for then I could take you also with me to our spinning-room . ”</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Tis a pity , ” said Ekkehard .</p>
   <p>The next morning they went down the valley in gay procession . The old herdsman had put on his finest linen shirt , and looked like some jolly old patriarch . With a round leathern cap on his head , and the handsomest milk-pail on his left shoulder , he walked ahead , singing the “ ranz-des-vaches ” in a clear fresh voice . Then came Benedicta 's goats ; the skirmishers of the great army ; their keeper amongst them , wearing in her dark locks the last Alpine roses , which already showed some yellow leaves . Then came the big large-spotted Susanna , the queen of the herd , wearing the heavy bell round her neck , in sign of her high rank . Dignified and proud was her gait , and whenever one of the others ventured to outstrip her , she gave her such a contemptuous and threatening look , that the presumptuous cow instantly fell back . Slowly and heavily the rest of the herd marched downhill . “ Farewell thou dainty Alpine-grass , ” was probably thought by many a plump cow , as it cropped a stray flower here and there , on the way-side .</p>
   <p>The bull carried the milking-stool between his horns , and on his huge back sat the goat-boy , with his face to the tail , holding up the outstretched fingers of both his hands to his not over delicately formed nose , and calling out the following doggrel-verses :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ The summer 's gone away , and autumn 's come aright ,</l>
     <l n="2">So now we will bid you farewell and goodnight .</l>
     <l n="3">Ye silent , snowy masters , good-bye then all together</l>
     <l n="4">And may your sleep be sound , until there 's better weather ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">A sledge with the simple furniture and kitchen utensils , closed the</l>
     <l n="6">train .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>By degrees , herdsmen , cows and goats disappeared in the fir-wood below ; their joyous songs and the merry tinkle of the cow-bells dying away in the distance ; and then it became silent and lonely , as on that evening when Ekkehard had first knelt before the cross of the Wildkirchlein .</p>
   <p>He entered his hermitage . During his solitary life in the mountains , he had learnt to understand , that solitude is only a school for life , and not life itself ; and that he , who in this busy , active world will only be a passive spectator , wrapped up in himself , must in the end become a useless being .</p>
   <p>“ There 's no help for it , ” said he , “ I too must return to the valley ! The snow is too cold , and I am too young to remain a hermit . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Farewell then , mighty Saentis , thou good and trusty friend ,</l>
     <l n="2">Farewell , ye bonny meadows , that healthy breezes sent !</l>
     <l n="3">I thank thee for thy blessings , oh holy solitude .</l>
     <l n="4">That took away my sorrow , heal 'd my rebellious mood .</l>
     <l n="5">My heart now beateth calmly ; my banner is unfurl 'd ,</l>
     <l n="6">And longing for new battles , I go into the world .</l>
     <l n="7">My youth was idle dreaming ,— then came the darksome night ,</l>
     <l n="8">But here , among the mountains , I woke to life and light . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>He seized his knapsack , and in it put his scanty belongings . His most precious thing , the Waltari song , carefully wrapped up , was placed on the top . A smile played round his lips as he looked about on the few things which he left behind . On a stone stood the half empty ink-bottle , which he took and threw down the abyss , where it broke into many glittering fragments . The three-cornered harp , leaning against the wall outside , had something melancholy about it .</p>
   <p>“ Thou shalt remain here , and sweeten the lonely hours of him who comes after me , ” said he . “ But mind not to give forth weak , sweetish sounds ; else it were better that the water should drop down on thy strings from the crevices , so that they get rusty , and that the winds from the glaciers break them . I have sung my song ! ”</p>
   <p>Therewith he hung the harp on a nail .</p>
   <p>During his hermit 's life , he had carved for himself a strong bow ,— quiver and arrows being still there from Gottshalk 's time . Thus he was well armed , and after hanging his wolf 's skin mantle round his shoulders , he stood before his hermitage , casting a long , long look at the beautiful scenery around ; at his beloved mountain peaks ,— and then let his gaze glide down into the depth , where the seagreen Seealpsee peeped forth from between the dark fir-trees . It was all as beautiful as ever .</p>
   <p>The black-martin , which lived in a crevice of the same rock that sheltered him , confidingly flew down on his shoulder and pecked his cheek ,— then spreading its black and red plumage it flew up into the blue air , as if it wanted to tell the Saentis that the hermit was going away .</p>
   <p>Firmly setting the point of his spear into the ground , he walked down the well-accustomed giddy path . When he had reached the Aesher , he stopped once more , and waving his hand to his hermitage , he uttered a long “ Jodler ” that reverberated from the Kamor and Hohen-Kasten to the Maarwiese , until it was lost in the distant clefts of the mountains .</p>
   <p>“ He can do it well , ” said a returning herdsman in the valley to one of his comrades .</p>
   <p>“ Almost like a goat-boy ! ” said the other , as Ekkehard was just disappearing behind a rocky wall .</p>
   <p>The rising sun had already cast his rays for some time on the Wildkirchlein , which , like a deserted nest , seemed to look mournfully into the valley below .</p>
   <p>At the Bodensee , people prepared for the coming vintage . One fine evening , Dame Hadwig sat in her garden , with the faithful Praxedis by her side . The Greek had unpleasant times now . Her mistress was out of tune , discontented and reserved . To-day likewise she could not entice her into a conversation . It was a day of evil remembrances .</p>
   <p>“ To-day it is just a year , ” Praxedis began , with seeming indifference , “ that we sailed over the Bodensee , and paid a visit to St. Gallus . ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The Duchess made no reply . “ A great deal has happened since then , ”</l>
     <l n="2">Praxedis was going to add , but the words died on her lips .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ And have you heard , gracious mistress , what people are saying of</l>
     <l n="4">Ekkehard ? ” resumed she , after a considerable pause .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">Dame Hadwig looked up . Her mouth was working .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="6">“ And what do people say ? ” she asked carelessly .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Master Spazzo has lately encountered the Abbot from the Reichenau , ” said Praxedis , “ who accosted him thus : ‘ The Alps have been highly favoured , for the walls of the Saentis reverberate with the sound of the lyre and poetical twitterings ; for a new Homer has built his nest up there , and if he only knew in which cave the muses are living , he might lead their dance like the Cynthian Apollo . ’ And when Master Spazzo , shaking his head , replied , ‘ how does that regard me ? ’ then the Abbot said : ‘ The poet 's no other than your Ekkehard . This news has reached us from the cloister-school at St. Gall . ’ Master Spazzo then rejoined laughingly : ‘ How can a man sing , who is not able to tell a story even ? ’ ”</p>
   <p>The Duchess had risen . “ Be silent , ” said she , “ I wo n't hear anything more about it . ” Praxedis understood the wave of her hand , and sorrowfully went away .</p>
   <p>Dame Hadwig 's heart , however , felt differently from what her tongue uttered . She stepped up to the garden-wall , and looked over towards the Helvetian mountains . Dusk had set in , and long , heavy steel-gray clouds stood immovably over the evening-red that glowed and trembled beneath them .</p>
   <p>In looking at the beauty and softness of the waning day , her heart was softened also . Her eyes were riveted on the Saentis , and it was as if she saw a vision , in which the Heavens opened and sent down two angels , who , descending to those heights , lifted up a man in a well-known monk 's habit , and the man was pale and dead , and an aureole of light , clear and beautiful surrounded the airy procession ...</p>
   <p>But Ekkehard was not dead .</p>
   <p>A low hissing sound , made the Duchess start up from her reverie . Her eyes glided over the dark rocky wall , down which the prisoner had once made his escape , and beheld a dark figure disappearing in the shade , whilst an arrow sped towards her , and dropped heavily at her feet .</p>
   <p>She bent down to take up the curious missile . No hostile hand had sent it from the bow . Thin parchment-leaves were rolled round the shaft , whilst the point was covered with some wild flowers . She untied the leaves , and did not fail to recognize the handwriting . It was “ Waltari 's song . ” On the first page was written in pale red ink : “ A parting salutation for the Duchess of Suabia ! ” and beside it the words of the apostle James : “ Blessed is the man , who has conquered temptation . ”</p>
   <p>Then the proud woman inclined her head , and wept bitterly .—</p>
   <p>Here our story is ended .</p>
   <p>Ekkehard went out into the wide world , and never set eyes again on the Hohentwiel . Neither did he ever return to the monastery of St. Gall . It is true that when he descended from the Alps and approached the well-known walls , he reflected whether he should not enter it again as a penitent ; but at the right moment an adage of the old Master of the Alps occurred to him : “ when a man has once been master , he does not like to become a servant again , ” — and so he passed by .</p>
   <p>Later , a good deal was talked about a certain Ekkehard at the court of the Saxon Emperor , who was said to be a proud , strong-willed and reserved man ; who to great piety united great contempt for the world ,— but contented , active and well-versed in all the arts . He became the Emperor 's chancellor , and tutor of his young son ; and his counsel was of great influence in all the affairs of the realm . One historian reports of him , that by degrees he had risen to so much honour , that there was a rumour that the highest dignity of the Church was awaiting him .</p>
   <p>The Empress Adelheid , also held him in great esteem ; and his influence was one of the chief causes that an army was sent out against the overbearing King of Denmark .</p>
   <p>It has not been ascertained whether this was the same Ekkehard of our story .</p>
   <p>Others have pretended that there had been several monks of the name of Ekkehard in the monastery of St. Gall ; and that he , who had instructed the Duchess in Latin , was not the same who had composed Waltari 's song .</p>
   <p>Those , however , who have attentively read the story which we have now happily brought to a conclusion , know better .</p>
   <p>About the fate of the others whom our tale , in many-coloured forms , has brought before the reader 's eye , there is not much left to be told .</p>
   <p>The Duchess Hadwig never married again ; and in her pious widowhood reached a considerable age . Later , she founded a humble little convent on the Hohentwiel , to which she bequeathed her territories in the Allemannian lands .</p>
   <p>Ekkehard 's name was no more allowed to be mentioned before her ; but Waltari 's song was read very often , and she evidently derived much pleasure and comfort from it . According to an ,— however unwarranted assertion of the monks from the Reichenau ,— she is said to have known it almost by heart .</p>
   <p>Praxedis faithfully served her mistress for some years more ; but by degrees an irresistible longing for her bright , sunny home , took possession of her , so that she declared that she could not bear the Suabian air any longer .</p>
   <p>Richly dowered , the Duchess let her go from her . Master Spazzo , the chamberlain , gave her a gallant and honourable escort as far as Venetia ; from whence a Greek galley bore the still pretty maiden from the city of St. Mark , to Byzantium . The accounts which she gave there of the Bodensee , and the rough but faithful barbarian hearts near its shores , were received by all the waiting-women at the Greek court with a dubious shake of the head , as if she were speaking of a bewitched sea , and some fabulous country .</p>
   <p>Old Moengal , for some time longer took care of the spiritual welfare of his parishioners . When the Huns threatened the land with another invasion , he spent much time in making plans for their reception . He proposed to dig some hundred deep pit-falls in the plain ; to cover them with boughs and ferns , and behind them , in full battle-array , to wait for the enemy ; so that horses and riders should thus be frustrated in their wicked designs .</p>
   <p>The evil guests , however , did not make their reappearance in the Hegau , and thus robbed the parish-priest of the pleasure of splitting their skulls with the mighty blows of his shilalah . A peaceful death overtook the old sportsman , just when he was about to rest himself after a prosperous falcon-hunt . On his grave , in the shadow of his grey parish-church there grew a holly-bush , which became higher and more knotty than any which had ever been seen in those parts ; and people said that it must be an offspring of their priest 's good bludgeon , Cambutta .</p>
   <p>Audifax , the goat-herd , learned the goldsmith 's art , and settled down in the bishopric of Constance , where he produced much fine workmanship . The companion of his adventures , there became his wedded spouse , and the Duchess was god-mother to their first little son .</p>
   <p>Burkhard the cloister-pupil , became a celebrated Abbot of the monastery of St. Gallus , and on all great occasions he still manufactured many dozens of learned Latin verses , from which , however , thanks to the destroying powers of time , posterity has been spared .</p>
   <p>... And all have long since become dust and ashes . Centuries have passed , in swift procession over the places , where their fates were fulfilled ; and new stories have taken the place of the old ones .</p>
   <p>The Hohentwiel has still witnessed a good deal , during war and peace . Many a brave knight rode out of its gates , and many an imprisoned man pined in its vaults ,— until the last hour of the proud fortress struck ; for on a fine day in May , it was blown to pieces by the enemy , so that towers and walls were scattered into the air .</p>
   <p>In the present day , ‘ tis quiet enough on that summit . The goats are peacefully grazing between the huge fragments ; but from over the glittering Bodensee , the Saentis still stands out in the blue distance , as grand and beautiful as it did many hundred years ago ; and it is still a pleasurable thing , seated in the luxuriant grass , to look over the land .</p>
   <p>He , who has written this book , has sat up there , on many a spring-evening , a strange and lonely guest ; and the crows and jackdaws flew tauntingly around him , as if they wanted to mock him , because he was so lonely ; and they did not notice that a numerous and honourable party was assembled around him .— They were all those in fact , whose acquaintance the reader has made in the course of this story ; and they told him every thing ; clearly and distinctly , and they kindly encouraged him to write it down , thus to help them to live again in the memory of a later , railway-hurrying present .</p>
   <p>And if he has succeeded in calling up also before you , much beloved reader , who have patiently followed him till now , a distinct picture of that faded , bygone time , then he considers himself well paid for his trouble , and some head-ache . Fare-thee-well ! and be his friend also in the future !</p>
