    <p>W ] ith the exception of “ The Doom of King Acrisius , ” “ Pygmalion and the Image ” is the only poem of The Earthly Paradise for the illustration of which Burne-Jones actually executed a complete series of pictures ; and though the finished paintings are but four in number , and the original designs , made in 1866-1867 , were twelve , the numerically smaller set is complete in the best sense , since not only does it illustrate fully the text and spirit of Morris 's poem , but each picture in it , though finished with the loving care and elaboration which Burne-Jones lavished on his paintings , fails of its full significance unless considered in its relation to the series of which it forms a part .</p>
   </figure>
   <p>In regard to the poem itself , the inspiration of these pictures , even the most casual study will bring in its train a conviction that the story as told by William Morris is far superior to any other version of classic or of modern times . The poem ( one of the best of those comprised in The Earthly Paradise ) is homogeneous and admirably balanced in all its parts ; its superiority , however , over all other versions , is not due primarily to the manner of its narration , but arises from its greater spirituality — a finer feeling rather than a finer form . Prior to the appearance of “ Pygmalion and the Image ” each narrator of the legend had dwelt mainly on the physical side , sensuous or sensual according to his temperament , of the tale . In Morris 's version the dominant note is the passionate delight — enthusiasm verging upon madness — of the artist and craftsman in his own handiwork , reflecting , to a marked degree , Morris 's own temperament , one of the leading characteristics of which was his habit of hurling himself headlong into each new project as it claimed his attention from time to time . That he was prevented thereby from arriving at perfection in any one art need not lessen the admiration due to him for his whole-souled ( though usually short-lived ) absorption in many and diverse arts . A great poet , in the sense that Chaucer , his master and model , was great , Morris was not ; but no one can deny to him the title of an enthusiastic and skilled craftsman of verse . It is this love of craftsmanship for its own sake , joined to a remarkable feeling for decorative beauty which both possessed , that binds the pictures of Burne-Jones and this poem by Morris so closely together that they form one perfect whole . Even the ideal and wholly imaginary world in which their figures move is the same — a land where emotion rather than passion bears sway , where the fates of man and of woman are determined by a whim of the gods rather than dominated by the chivalrous or devout hardihood of the individual .</p>
   <p>In his “ Apology ” prefixed to The Earthly Paradise , Morris clearly and definitely disclaims any moral purpose in the poems comprised in it .</p>
   <p>“ Why should I strive to set the crooked straight ? ” he writes . How far this feeling was shared by Burne-Jones we can never know , but nearly all of his biographers are agreed that a love of beauty , as he understood it , was his main preoccupation , or , to use his own words , that a picture should be a “ beautiful , romantic dream . ” Julia Cartwright , in her Life and Work of Sir Edward Burne-Jones , says : “ He never tried to point a moral or to teach a lesson ; but he rescued beauty from the forgetfulness to which it seemed doomed in a restless and material age , and in so doing has given us an example of the highest value . ” Malcolm Bell , also , writing of the art of Burne-Jones and of its critics , expresses a like opinion , and his analysis of the paintings composing the Pygmalion Series is not only interesting in itself , but is especially so as showing the extent to which the man of letters can read his own interpretation into the work of a painter .</p>
   <p>“ The four pictures from ‘ The Story of Pygmalion , ’ ” he writes , “ also included in The Earthly Paradise , again show this preference of the poet and the artist for the spirit before the form , provided only the last be beautiful . The first , ‘ The Heart Desires , ’ is the idealization of unsatisfied longing for the unknown . Pygmalion , a tall , dark-haired young man , in a long garment falling in straight folds to his feet , stands brooding on life 's emptiness in the vestibule of his house . A sculptured group of the Three Graces denotes his profession and at the same time typifies the cold beauty of artifice , the beauty of the mind , while two girls , seen through the open door , speeding along the street in the artless embrace of innocent maidenhood , represent the beauty of the body and the love that waits his winning ; but in neither finds he consolation . In the second , ‘ The Hand Refrains , ’ the days of long labor are ended , and the artist 's ideal , the cold , pure figure of the yet soulless image stands finished on the still rough pedestal , surrounded by flakes and chips of marble and implements of the sculptor 's craft , while Pygmalion , chisel and mallet in hand , stays gazing in awe at the marvel his hand has achieved , his eyes content , but his soul still hungering . Outside the window behind him women go about their daily business in the city street , and through another casement , in a recess between him and the image , is a glimpse of a garden and a spurt of water falling into a marble basin — the constant dropping that wears away the stone , as his constant prayers shall move the goddess Venus to a miracle on his behalf . The third bears the motto , ‘ The Godhead Fires . ’ Into the sculptor 's chamber , silent and solitary , while Pygmalion is away in the temple , floats lightly the Queen of Love , clad in a soft , transparent robe , flower-crowned and bearing a branch of myrtle , emblem of marriage rites , her feet brushed and environed by the white wings of her favorite doves . Towards her , leaning both arms on one uplifted from the goddess 's side , an exquisite piece of composition , the awakening image stoops from the carved capital , blossom-strewn by the adoring Pygmalion , her eyes raised in awe up to the goddess , who with fixed gaze and pointed finger inspires her with the Promethean fire of life . Lastly , ‘ The Soul Attains . ’ Heart and soul are alike satisfied . Pygmalion kneels , looking up in trembling worship at the beautiful creature who lingeringly yields him her hands , though she still gazes out beyond him in dumb amazement at the mystery of consciousness that has suddenly been born in her . Marble no longer , but not yet altogether woman . ”</p>
   <p>“ Dreamer of dreams , born out of my due time , ” is even more appropriate to Burne-Jones than to its author , William Morris , and it is an ever-to-be-regretted misfortune that two poems only of those comprised in The Earthly Paradise should have received at his hands that illuminative pictorial treatment which he , “ the arch-dreamer of the nineteenth century , ” as Cosmo Monkhouse styles him , alone could give . Thanks to Mr. Frederick Hollyer , we have in the reproductions which follow faithful transcripts , in all but color , of the original paintings , and can carry out , after the lapse of a quarter of a century and in another hemisphere , a project which both Burne-Jones and William Morris held dear , but which neither of them lived to see realized . To their memory this book , together with the recently re-issued Doom of King Acrisius , is dedicated .</p>

     <l n="2">Of Cyprus looks across the Syrian sea ,</l>
     <l n="3">There did in ancient time a man abide</l>
     <l n="4">Known to the island-dwellers , for that he</l>
     <l n="5">Had wrought most godlike works in imagery ,</l>
     <l n="6">And day by day still greater honor won ,</l>
     <l n="7">Which man our old books call Pygmalion .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">Yet in the praise of men small joy he had ,</l>
     <l n="9">But walked abroad with downcast , brooding face .</l>
     <l n="10">Nor yet by any damsel was made glad ;</l>
     <l n="11">For , sooth to say , the women of that place</l>
     <l n="12">Must seem to all men an accursed race ,</l>
     <l n="13">Who with the turner of all hearts once strove ,</l>
     <l n="14">So in their hearts must carry lust for love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">Now on a day it chanced that he had been</l>
     <l n="16">About the streets , and on the crowded quays ,</l>
     <l n="17">Rich with unopened wealth of bales , had seen</l>
     <l n="18">The dark-eyed merchants of the Southern seas</l>
     <l n="19">In chaffer with the base Propoetides ,</l>
     <l n="20">And heavy-hearted gat him home again ,</l>
     <l n="21">His once-loved life grown idle , poor , and vain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="22">And there upon his images he cast</l>
     <l n="23">His weary eyes , yet little noted them ,</l>
     <l n="24">As still from name to name his swift thought passed ,</l>
     <l n="25">For what to him was Juno 's well-wrought hem ,</l>
     <l n="26">Diana 's shaft , or Pallas ’ olive-stem ?</l>
     <l n="27">What help could Hermes ’ rod unto him give ,</l>
     <l n="28">Until with shadowy things he came to live ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="29">Yet note , that though , while looking on the sun ,</l>
     <l n="30">The craftsman o'er his work some morn of spring</l>
     <l n="31">May chide his useless labor never done ,</l>
     <l n="32">For all his murmurs , with no other thing</l>
     <l n="33">He soothes his heart , and dulls thought 's poisonous sting ,</l>
     <l n="34">And thus in thought 's despite the world goes on ;</l>
     <l n="35">And so it was with this Pygmalion .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="36">Unto the chisel must he set his hand ,</l>
     <l n="37">And slowly , still in troubled thought must pace</l>
     <l n="38">About a work begun , that there doth stand ,</l>
     <l n="39">And still returning to the self-same place ,</l>
     <l n="40">Unto the image now must set his face ,</l>
     <l n="41">And with a sigh his wonted toil begin ,</l>
     <l n="42">Half loathed , half loved , a little rest to win .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="43">The lessening marble that he worked upon ,</l>
     <l n="44">A woman 's form now imaged doubtfully ,</l>
     <l n="45">And in such guise the work had he begun ,</l>
     <l n="46">Because when he the untouched block did see</l>
     <l n="47">In wandering veins that form there seemed to be ,</l>
     <l n="48">Whereon he cried out in a careless mood ,</l>
     <l n="49">“ O lady Venus , make this presage good !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="50">“ And then this block of stone shall be thy maid ,</l>
     <l n="51">And , not without rich golden ornament ,</l>
     <l n="52">Shall bide within thy quivering myrtle-shade . ”</l>
     <l n="53">So spoke he , but the goddess , well content ,</l>
     <l n="54">Unto his hand such godlike mastery sent ,</l>
     <l n="55">That like the first artificer he wrought ,</l>
     <l n="56">Who made the gift that woe to all men brought .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="57">And yet , but such as he was wont to do ,</l>
     <l n="58">At first indeed that work divine he deemed ,</l>
     <l n="59">And as the white chips from the chisel flew</l>
     <l n="60">Of other matters languidly he dreamed ,</l>
     <l n="61">For easy to his hand that labor seemed ,</l>
     <l n="62">And he was stirred with many a troubling thought ,</l>
     <l n="63">And many a doubt perplexed him as he wrought .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="64">And yet , again , at last there came a day</l>
     <l n="65">When smoother and more shapely grew the stone ,</l>
     <l n="66">And he , grown eager , put all thought away</l>
     <l n="67">But that which touched his craftsmanship alone ;</l>
     <l n="68">And he would gaze at what his hands had done ,</l>
     <l n="69">Until his heart with boundless joy would swell</l>
     <l n="70">That all was wrought so wonderfully well .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="71">Yet long it was ere he was satisfied ,</l>
     <l n="72">And with his pride that by his mastery</l>
     <l n="73">This thing was done , whose equal far and wide</l>
     <l n="74">In no town of the world a man could see ,</l>
     <l n="75">Came burning longing that the work should be</l>
     <l n="76">E'en better still , and to his heart there came</l>
     <l n="77">A strange and strong desire he could not name .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="78">The night seemed long , and long the twilight seemed ,</l>
     <l n="79">A vain thing seemed his flowery garden fair ;</l>
     <l n="80">Though through the night still of his work he dreamed ,</l>
     <l n="81">And though his smooth-stemmed trees so nigh it were</l>
     <l n="82">That thence he could behold the marble hair ,</l>
     <l n="83">Naught was enough , until with steel in hand</l>
     <l n="84">He came before the wondrous stone to stand .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="85">No song could charm him , and no histories</l>
     <l n="86">Of men 's misdoings could avail him now —</l>
     <l n="87">Nay , scarcely seaward had he turned his eyes</l>
     <l n="88">If men had said , “ The fierce Tyrrhenians row</l>
     <l n="89">Up through the bay ; rise up and strike a blow</l>
     <l n="90">For life and goods ” ; for naught to him seemed dear</l>
     <l n="91">But to his well-loved work to be anear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="92">Then vexed he grew , and , knowing not his heart ,</l>
     <l n="93">Unto himself he said , “ Ah , what is this</l>
     <l n="94">That I who oft was happy to depart</l>
     <l n="95">And wander where the boughs each other kiss</l>
     <l n="96">‘ Neath the west wind , now have no other bliss</l>
     <l n="97">But in vain smoothing of this marble maid ,</l>
     <l n="98">Whose chips this month a drachma had outweighed ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="99">“ Lo ! I will get me to the woods and try</l>
     <l n="100">If I my woodcraft have forgotten quite ,</l>
     <l n="101">And then , returning , lay this folly by ,</l>
     <l n="102">And eat my fill , and sleep my sleep anight ,</l>
     <l n="103">And ‘ gin to carve a Hercules aright</l>
     <l n="104">Upon the morrow , and perchance indeed</l>
     <l n="105">The Theban will be good to me at need . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="106">With that he took his quiver and his bow ,</l>
     <l n="107">And through the gates of Amathus he went ,</l>
     <l n="108">And towards the mountain slopes began to go ,</l>
     <l n="109">Within the woods to work out his intent .</l>
     <l n="110">Fair was the day , the honied bean-field 's scent</l>
     <l n="111">The west wind bore unto him ; o'er the way</l>
     <l n="112">The glittering , noisy poplar leaves did play .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="113">All things were moving ; as his hurried feet</l>
     <l n="114">Passed by , within the flowery swath he heard</l>
     <l n="115">The sweeping of the scythe , the swallow fleet</l>
     <l n="116">Rose over him , the sitting partridge stirred</l>
     <l n="117">On the field 's edge ; the brown bee by him whirred ,</l>
     <l n="118">Or murmured in the clover flowers below ;</l>
     <l n="119">But he with bowed-down head failed not to go .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="120">At last he stopped , and , looking round , he said ,</l>
     <l n="121">“ Like one whose thirtieth year is well gone by ,</l>
     <l n="122">The day is getting ready to be dead ;</l>
     <l n="123">No rest , and on the border of the sky</l>
     <l n="124">Already the great banks of dark haze lie ;</l>
     <l n="125">No rest — what do I midst this stir and noise ?—</l>
     <l n="126">What part have I in these unthinking joys ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="127">With that he turned , and towards the city gate</l>
     <l n="128">Through the sweet fields went swifter than he came ,</l>
     <l n="129">And cast his heart into the hands of fate ;</l>
     <l n="130">Nor strove with it , when higher ‘ gan to flame</l>
     <l n="131">That strange and strong desire without a name ;</l>
     <l n="132">Till panting , thinking of naught else , once more</l>
     <l n="133">His hand was on the latch of his own door .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="134">One moment there he lingered , as he said ,</l>
     <l n="135">“ Alas ! what should I do if she were gone ? ”</l>
     <l n="136">But even with that word his brow waxed red</l>
     <l n="137">To hear his own lips name a thing of stone ,</l>
     <l n="138">As though the gods some marvel there had done ,</l>
     <l n="139">And made his work alive ; and therewithal ,</l>
     <l n="140">In turn , great pallor on his face did fall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="141">But with a sigh he passed into the house ;</l>
     <l n="142">Yet even then his chamber door must hold ,</l>
     <l n="143">And listen there , half blind and timorous ,</l>
     <l n="144">Until his heart should wax a little bold ;</l>
     <l n="145">Then , entering , motionless and white and cold ,</l>
     <l n="146">He saw the image stand amidst the floor</l>
