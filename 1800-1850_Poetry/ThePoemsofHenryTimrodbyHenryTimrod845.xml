    <head>Introduction</head>
    <p n="1">“ A true poet is one of the most precious gifts that can be bestowed on a generation . ” He speaks for it and he speaks to it . Reflecting and interpreting his age and its thoughts , feelings , and purposes , he speaks for it ; and with a love of truth , with a keener moral insight into the universal heart of man , and with the intuition of inspiration , he speaks to it , and through it to the world . It is thus</p>
    <p n="2">“ The poet to the whole wide world belongs , Even as the Teacher is the child 's . ”</p>
    <p n="3">“ Nor is it to the great masters alone that our homage and thankfulness are due . Wherever a true child of song strikes his harp , we love to listen . All that we ask is that the music be native , born of impassioned impulse that will not be denied , heartfelt , like the lark when she soars up to greet the morning and pours out her song by the same quivering ecstasy that impels her flight . ” For though the voices be many , the oracle is one , for “ God gave the poet his song . ”</p>
    <p n="4">Such was Henry Timrod , the Southern poet . A child of nature , his song is the voice of the Southland . Born in Charleston , S. C ., December 8th , 1829 , his life cast in the seething torrent of civil war , his voice was also the voice of Carolina , and through her of the South , in all the rich glad life poured out in patriotic pride into that fatal struggle , in all the valor and endurance of that dark conflict , in all the gloom of its disaster , and in all the sacred tenderness that clings about its memories . He was the poet of the Lost Cause , the finest interpreter of the feelings and traditions of the splendid heroism of a brave people . Moreover , by his catholic spirit , his wide range , and world-wide sympathies , he is a true American poet .</p>
    <p n="5">The purpose of the TIMROD MEMORIAL ASSOCIATION of his native city and State , in undertaking this new edition of his poems , is to erect a suitable public memorial to the poet , and also to let his own words renew and keep his own memory in his land 's literature .</p>

   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>The earliest edition of Timrod 's poems was a small volume by Ticknor &amp; Fields , of<settlement>Boston</settlement>, in<date>1860</date>, just before the Civil War . This contained only the poems of the first eight or nine years previous , and was warmly welcomed North and South . The “<settlement>New York</settlement>Tribune ” then greeted this small first volume in these words : “ These poems are worthy of a wide audience , and they form a welcome offering to the common literature of our country . ” In this first volume was evinced the culture , the lively fancy , the delicate and vigorous imagination , and the finished artistic power of his mind , even then rejoicing in the fullness and freshness of its creations and in the unwearied flow of its natural music . But it fell then on the great world of letters almost unheeded , shut out by the war cloud that soon broke upon the land , enveloping all in darkness . The edition of his complete poems was not issued until the South was recovering from the ravage of war , and was entitled “ The Poems of Henry Timrod , edited with a sketch of the Poet 's life by Paul H. Hayne . E. J. Hale &amp; Son , publishers ,<settlement>New York</settlement>,<date>1873</date>. ” And immediately , in<date>1874</date>, there followed a second edition of this volume , which contained the noble series of war poems and other lyrics written since the edition of<date>1860</date>. In<date>1884</date>an illustrated edition of “ Katie ” was published by Hale &amp; Son ,<settlement>New York</settlement>. All of these editions were long ago exhausted by an admiring public . The present edition contains the poems of all the former editions , and also some earlier poems not heretofore published .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>The name of Timrod has been closely identified with the history of South Carolina for over a century . Before the Revolution , Henry Timrod , of German birth , the founder of the family in America , was a prominent citizen of Charleston , and the president of that historic association , the German Friendly Society , still existing , a century and a quarter old . We find his name first on the roll of the German Fusiliers of Charleston , volunteers formed in May , 1775 , for the defense of the country , immediately on hearing of the battle of Lexington . Again in the succeeding generation , in the Seminole war and in the peril of St. Augustine , the German Fusiliers were commanded by his son , Captain William Henry Timrod , who was the father of the poet , and who himself published a volume of poems in the early part of the century . He was the editor of a literary periodical published in Charleston , to which he himself largely contributed . He was of strong intellect and delicate feelings , and an ardent patriot . Some of the more striking of the poems of the elder Timrod are the following . Washington Irving said of these lines that Tom Moore had written no finer lyric :—</titlePart></docTitle>

   <p>To Time , the Old Traveler</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">They slander thee , Old Traveler ,</l>
     <l n="2">Who say that thy delight</l>
     <l n="3">Is to scatter ruin , far and wide ,</l>
     <l n="4">In thy wantonness of might :</l>
     <l n="5">For not a leaf that falleth</l>
     <l n="6">Before thy restless wings ,</l>
     <l n="7">But in thy flight , thou changest it</l>
     <l n="8">To a thousand brighter things .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Thou passest o'er the battlefield</l>
     <l n="10">Where the dead lie stiff and stark ,</l>
     <l n="11">Where naught is heard save the vulture 's scream ,</l>
     <l n="12">And the gaunt wolf 's famished bark ;</l>
     <l n="13">But thou hast caused the grain to spring</l>
     <l n="14">From the blood-enrichèd clay ,</l>
     <l n="15">And the waving corn-tops seem to dance</l>
     <l n="16">To the rustic 's merry lay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Thou hast strewed the lordly palace</l>
     <l n="18">In ruins on the ground ,</l>
     <l n="19">And the dismal screech of the owl is heard</l>
     <l n="20">Where the harp was wont to sound ;</l>
     <l n="21">But the selfsame spot thou coverest</l>
     <l n="22">With the dwellings of the poor ,</l>
     <l n="23">And a thousand happy hearts enjoy</l>
     <l n="24">What ONE usurped before .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ T is true thy progress layeth Full many a loved one low , And for the brave and beautiful Thou hast caused our tears to flow ; But always near the couch of death Nor thou , nor we can stay ; AND THE BREATH OF THY DEPARTING WINGS , DRIES ALL OUR TEARS AWAY !</p>
   <p>The Mocking-Bird</p>
   <p>Nor did lack Sweet music to the magic of the scene : The little crimson-breasted Nonpareil Was there , his tiny feet scarce bending down The silken tendril that he lighted on To pour his love notes ; and in russet coat , Most homely , like true genius bursting forth In spite of adverse fortune , a full choir Within himself , the merry Mock Bird sate , Filling the air with melody ; and at times , IN THE RAPT FAVOR OF HIS SWEETEST SONG , HIS QUIVERING FORM WOULD SPRING INTO THE SKY , IN SPIRAL CIRCLES , AS IF HE WOULD CATCH NEW POWERS FROM KINDRED WARBLERS IN THE CLOUDS WHO WOULD BEND DOWN TO GREET HIM !</p>
   <p>These lines , addressed to the poet by his father , have a pathetic interest :—</p>

     <l n="1">Harry , my little blue-eyed boy ,</l>

     <l n="4">To a fond father 's ear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">I love to see the lines of mirth</l>
     <l n="6">Mantle thy cheek and forehead fair ,</l>

     <l n="8">Had met to revel there ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">For gazing on thee , do I sigh</l>
     <l n="10">That those most happy years must flee ,</l>
     <l n="11">And thy full share of misery</l>
     <l n="12">Must fall in life on thee !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">There is no lasting grief below ,</l>
     <l n="14">My Harry ! that flows not from guilt ;</l>

     <l n="16">In after times thou wilt .</l>

     <l n="17">Thou'lt read it when the churchyard clay</l>

     <l n="20">Thou shalt be always blest .</l>

     <l n="21">They 'll tell thee this terrestrial ball ,</l>
     <l n="22">To man for his enjoyment given ,</l>
     <l n="23">Is but a state of sinful thrall</l>
     <l n="24">To keep the soul from heaven .</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="25">My boy ! the verdure-crownèd hills ,</l>
     <l n="26">The vales where flowers innumerous blow ,</l>

     <l n="29">God is no tyrant who would spread</l>
     <l n="30">Unnumbered dainties to the eyes ,</l>

   <p>No ! all can do his creatures good , He scatters round with hand profuse — The only precept understood , ENJOY , BUT NOT ABUSE !</p>
   <p>The poet 's mother was the daughter of Mr. Charles Prince , a citizen of Charleston , whose parents had come from England just before the Revolution . Mr . Prince had married Miss French , daughter of an officer in the Revolution , whose family were from Switzerland . It was the influence of his mother also that helped to form the poet 's character , and his intense and passionate love of nature . Her beautiful face and form , her purity and goodness , her delight in all the sights and sounds of the country , her childish rapture in wood and field , her love of flowers and trees , and all the mystery and gladness of nature , are among the cherished memories of all her children , and vividly described by the poet 's sister .</p>
   <p>William Henry Timrod , father of the poet , died of disease contracted in the Florida war , and his family thereafter were in straitened circumstances . Nevertheless , the early education of his gifted son was provided for . Paul H. Hayne , the poet , was one of his earliest friends and schoolmates at Charleston 's best school . They sat together , and to his brother boy-poet he first showed his earliest verses in exulting confidence . This friendship and confidence lasted through life , and Hayne has tenderly embalmed it in his sketch of the poet . We have this faithful picture of him at that time :—</p>
   <p>“ Modest and diffident , with a nervous utterance , but with melody ever in his heart and on his lip . Though always slow of speech , he was yet , like Burns , quick to learn . The chariot wheels might jar in the gate through which he tried to drive his winged steeds , but the horses were of celestial temper and the car purest gold . ”</p>
   <p>His school-fellows remember him as silent and shy , full of quick impulse , and with an eager ambition , insatiable in his thirst for books , yet mingling freely in all sports , and rejoicing unspeakably in the weekly holiday and its long rambles through wood and field . “ The sweet security of streets ” had no charm for him . He rejoiced in Nature and her changing scenes and seasons . She was always to him comfort , refreshment , balm . She never turned her face from him , and through all his years he “ leaned on her breast with loving trustfulness as a little child . ”</p>
   <p>But he had other teachers . He studied all classic literature . “ The Æschylean drama had no attraction for him ; he reveled in the rich and elegant strains of Virgil , and of the many toned lyre of Horace and the silver lute of Catullus . ” From the full and inexhaustible fountain of English letters he drank unceasingly . Spenser , Shakespeare , Milton , Burns , Wordsworth , and , later , Tennyson were his immediate inspiration .</p>
   <p>His college life at the University of Georgia was interrupted by sickness and cramped by lack of means , and his literary plans were foiled by necessity . Nevertheless , he left his Alma Mater with a mind stirred to its depths , and with a large store of learning , and had already sounded with clear note those chords which were afterwards so vocal in melody .</p>
   <p>Dr. J. Dickson Bruns has left this graphic description of Timrod 's personal appearance , and of some prominent traits of his social character :—</p>
   <p>“ In stature , ” he says , “ Timrod was far below the medium height . He had always excelled in boyish sports , and , as he grew to manhood , his unusual breadth of shoulder still seemed to indicate a physical vigor which the slender wrists , thin , transparent hands , and habitually lax attitude but too plainly contradicted .</p>
   <p>“ The square jaw was almost stern in its strongly pronounced lines , the mouth large , the lips exquisitely sensitive , the gray eyes set deeply under massive brows , and full of a melancholy and pleading tenderness , which attracted attention to his face at once , as the face of one who had thought and suffered much .</p>
   <p>“ His walk was quick and nervous , with an energy in it that betokened decision of character , but ill sustained by the stammering speech ; for in society he was the shyest and most undemonstrative of men . To a single friend whom he trusted , he would pour out his inmost heart ; but let two or three be gathered together , above all , introduce a stranger , and he instantly became a quiet , unobtrusive listener , though never a moody or uncongenial one !</p>
   <p>“ Among men of letters , he was always esteemed as a most sympathetic companion ; timid , reserved , unready , if taken by surprise , but highly cultivated , and still more highly endowed .</p>
   <p>“ The key to his social character was to be found in the feminine gentleness of his temperament . He shrank from noisy debate , and the wordy clash of argument , as from a blow . It stunned and bewildered him , and left him , in the mêlée , alike incapable of defense or attack . And yet , when some burly protagonist would thrust himself too rudely into the ring , and try to bear down opposition by sheer vehemence of declamation , from the corner where he sat ensconced in unregarded silence , HE WOULD SUDDENLY SLING OUT SOME SHARP , SWIFT PEBBLE OF THOUGHT , which he had been slowly rounding , and smite with an aim so keen and true as rarely failed to bring down the boastful Anakim ! ”</p>
   <p>In Charleston , as a first effort in life , for a brief period Timrod attempted the law , but found that jealous mistress unsuited to his life work , though he had all the opportunity afforded him in the office of his friend , the Hon . J. L. Petigru , the great jurist . Leaving the bar , he thenceforward devoted himself to literature and to his art .</p>
   <p>Charleston to Timrod was home , and he always returned with kindling spirit to the city of his love . There were all his happiest associations and the delight of purest friendships ,— W. Gilmore Simms and Paul Hayne , and the rest of the literary coterie that presided over “ Russell 's Magazine ” , and Judge Bryan and Dr. Bruns ( to whom Hayne dedicated his edition of Timrod 's poems ) , and others were of this glad fellowship , and his social hours were bright in their intercourse and in the cordial appreciation of his genius and the tender love they bore him . These he never forgot , and returning after the ravage of war to his impoverished and suffering city , he writes , in the last year of his young life , “ My eyes were blind to everything and everybody but a few old friends . ”</p>
   <p>Suited by endowment and prepared by special study for a professorship , still all his efforts for the academic chair failed , and , finally , he was compelled to become a private teacher , an office the sacredness of which he profoundly realized . In his leisure hours he now gave himself up to deeper study of nature , literature , and man . It was in these few years of quiet retreat that he wrote the poems contained in the first edition of his works , 1859-60 , which , laden with all the poet 's longing to be heard , were little heeded in the first great shock of war . Indeed , in such a storm , what shelter could a poet find ? An ardent Carolinian , devoted to his native State with an allegiance as to his country , he left his books and study , and threw himself into the struggle , a volunteer in the army . In the first years of the war he was in and near Charleston , and wrote those memorable poems and martial lyrics : “ Carolina ” , “ A Cry to Arms ” , “ Charleston ” , “ Ripley ” , “ Ethnogenesis ” , and “ The Cotton Boll ” , which deeply stirred the heart of his State , and , indeed , of the whole South . His was the voice of his people . Under its spell the public response was quick , and promised largest honor and world-wide fame for the poet . The project formed by some of the most eminent men of the State , late in 1862 , was to publish an illustrated and highly embellished edition of his works in London . The war correspondent of the “ London Illustrated News ” , Vizitelly , himself an artist , promised original illustrations , and the future seemed bright for the gratification of his heart 's desire , to be known and heard in the great literary centre of the English-speaking world . But disappointment again was his lot . Amid the increasing stress of the conflict , every public and private energy in the South was absorbed in maintaining the ever weakening struggle ; and with all art and literature and learning our poet 's hopes were buried in the common grave of war ; not because he was not loved and cherished , and his genius appreciated , but because a terrible need was upon his people , and desperate issues were draining their life-blood . Then he went to the front . Too weak for the field ( for the fatal weakness that finally sapped his life was then upon him ) , he was compelled , under medical direction , to retire from the battle ranks , and made a last desperate effort to serve the cause he loved as a war correspondent . In this capacity he joined the great army of the West after the battle of Shiloh . The story of his camp life was indeed pathetic . Dr. Bruns writes of him then : “ One can scarcely conceive of a situation more hopelessly wretched than that of a mere child in the world 's ways suddenly flung down into the heart of that strong retreat , and tossed like a straw on the crest of those refluent waves from which he escaped as by a miracle . ” Home he came , baffled , dispirited , and sore hurt , to receive the succor of generous friendship , and for a brief time a safe congenial refuge , in 1864 , in an editor 's chair of the “ South Carolinian ” , at the capital of his native State . Here his strong pen wrote the stirring editorials of that critical time , and there , tempted by the passing hour of comparative calm , he married Miss Kate Goodwin , “ Katie , the fair Saxon ” of his exquisite song . Here the war that had broken all his plans , and wrecked his health and hopes , and made literature for a time in the South a beggar 's vocation , left him with wife and child , the “ darling Willie ” of his verse , dependent upon his already sapped and fast failing strength for support . Here he saw the capital of his native State , marked for vengeance , pitilessly destroyed by fire and sword . Here gaunt ruin stalked and want entered his own home , made desolate as all the hearthstones of his people . Here the peace that ensued was the peace of the desert ! Here the army , defeated and broken , came back after the long heroic struggle to blackened chimneys , sole vestige of home , and the South , with not even bread for her famished children , still stood in solemn silence by those deeper furrows watered with blood . The suffering that he endured was the common suffering of those around him ,— actual physical want and lack of the commonest comforts of life , felt most keenly by his sensitive nature and delicate constitution . In the midst of this fierce stress , his darling boy , the crown of his life , died . All his affections , it seemed , were poured out at once , as water spilled upon the ground . He was dying of consumption , and earth shadows crowded around him .</p>
   <p>Though long in feeble health , his last illness was brief . The best physicians lovingly gave their skillful ministration , and the State 's most eminent men , in their common need , tenderly cared for him and his . With death before him , he clung passionately to his art , absorbed in that alone and in the great Beyond . His latest occupation was correcting the proof-sheets of his own poems , and he passed away with them by his side , stained with his life-blood .</p>
   <p>In the autumn of 1867 he was laid by his beloved child in Trinity churchyard , Columbia , S. C. General Hampton , Governor Thompson , and other great Carolinians bore him to the grave ,— a grave that , through the sackcloth of the Reconstruction period in South Carolina , remained without a stone . But as he himself wrote of the host of the Southern dead of the war ,—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ In seeds of laurel in the earth</l>
     <l n="2">The blossom of your fame is blown ,</l>
     <l n="3">And somewhere waiting for its birth ,</l>
     <l n="4">The shaft is in the stone . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In later years loving friends reared a small memorial shaft to mark his grave . It was in that dark period that Carl McKinley 's genius was touched to these fine lines .</p>

   <p>The one characteristic above all others that marked the poet 's life was his unfaltering trust ,— the soul 's unclouded sky , a quenchless radiance of blessed sunlight amid the deep darkness that encompassed him .</p>
   <p>As in his poetry there is no false note , no doubtful sentiment , no selfish grief , even when he sings with breast against the thorn , so in his life do we find no word of bitterness or moaning or complaining . Even amid the terrible blight of war and its final utter ruin , prophet-like , he speaks in faith and hope and courage . His own heart breaking , and life ebbing , he writes of Spring as the true Reconstructionist , and pleads her message to his stricken people . It is so true and prophetic that we quote the words written in April , 1866 .</p>
   <p>“ For Spring is a true Reconstructionist ,— a reconstructionist in the best and most practical sense . There is not a nook in the land in which she is not at this moment exerting her influence in preparing a way for the restoration of the South . No politician may oppose her ; her power defies embarrassment ; but she is not altogether independent of help . She brings us balmy airs and gentle dews , golden suns and silver rains ; and she says to us , ‘ These are the materials of the only work in which you need be at present concerned ; avail yourselves of them to reclothe your naked country and feed your impoverished people , and you will find that , in the discharge of that task , you have taken the course which will most certainly and most peacefully conduct you to the position which you desire . Turn not aside to bandy epithets with your enemies ; stuff your ears , like the princess in the Arabian Nights , against words of insult and wrong ; pause not to muse over your condition , or to question your prospects ; but toil on bravely , silently , surely .... ’</p>
   <p>“ Such are the words of wise and kindly counsel , which , if we attend rightly , we may all hear in the winds and read in the skies of Spring . Nowhere , however , does she speak with so eloquent a voice or so pathetic an effect as in this ruined town . She covers our devastated courts with images of renovation in the shape of flowers ; she hangs once more in our blasted gardens the fragrant lamps of the jessamine ; in our streets she kindles the maple like a beacon ; and from amidst the charred and blackened ruins of once happy homes she pours , through the mouth of her favorite musician , the mocking-bird , a song of hope and joy . What is the lesson which she designs by these means to convey ? It may be summed in a single sentence ,— forgetfulness of the past , effort in the present , and trust for the future . ”</p>
   <p>Such was the lofty creed and last hopeful , but dying message to his brothers of the South , whose war songs he had written , and the requiem of whose martyred hosts he had chanted .</p>
   <p>Such was the tragedy that ended in October , 1867 , with the hero at the age of thirty-seven ; glory , genius , anguish , tears , but unconquerable faith and heroic fortitude . His larger life scarce begun , his full power felt , but only half expressed , he realized deeply —</p>
   <p>“ The petty done , the vast undone ! ”</p>
   <p>He yearned with passionate longing and hope and conscious might to fulfill an even greater mission ; but in the infinite providence of God the full fruitage of this exquisite soul was for another sphere . He was indeed “ one of those who stirred us , a friend of man and a lover . In no country of this earth could he long have been an alien , and that may now be said of his spirit . In no part of this universe could it feel lonely or unbefriended ; it was in harmony with all that flowers or gives perfume in life . ”</p>
   <p>The story of his last days , as given by his poet-friend , Paul Hayne , at the latter 's cottage among the pines , is of tender and peculiar interest , and we quote it here , as it was written in 1873 :—</p>
   <p>... In the latter summer-tide of this same year ( 1867 ) , I again persuaded him to visit me . Ah ! how sacred now , how sad and sweet , are the memories of that rich , clear , prodigal August of ‘ 67 !</p>
   <p>We would rest on the hillsides , in the swaying golden shadows , watching together the Titanic masses of snow-white clouds which floated slowly and vaguely through the sky , suggesting by their form , whiteness , and serene motion , despite the season , flotillas of icebergs upon Arctic seas . Like Lazzaroni we basked in the quiet noons , sunk into the depths of reverie , or perhaps of yet more “ charmed sleep ” . Or we smoked , conversing lazily between the puffs ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Next to some pine whose antique roots just peeped</l>
     <l n="2">From out the crumbling bases of the sand . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But the evenings , with their gorgeous sunsets “ rolling down like a chorus ” and the “ gray-eyed melancholy gloaming ” , were the favorite hours of the day with him . He would often apostrophize twilight in the language of Wordsworth 's sonnet :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Hail , twilight ! sovereign of one peaceful hour !</l>
     <l n="2">Not dull art thou as undiscerning night ;</l>
     <l n="3">But only studious to remove from sight</l>
     <l n="4">Day 's mutable distinctions . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Yes , ” said he , “ she is indeed sovereign of ONE PEACEFUL HOUR ! In the hardest , busiest time one feels the calm , merciful-minded queen stealing upon one in the fading light , and ‘ whispering ’ , as Ford has it ( or is it Fletcher ? ) ,— ‘ WHISPERING tranquillity ’ . ”</p>
   <p>When in-doors and disposed to read , he took much pleasure in perusing the poems of Robert Buchanan and Miss Ingelow . The latter 's “ Ballads ” particularly delighted him . One , written “ in the old English manner ” , he quickly learned by heart , repeating it with a relish and fervor indescribable .</p>
   <p>Here is the opening stanza :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Come out and hear the waters shoot , the owlet hoot , the owlet hoot ;</l>
     <l n="2">Yon crescent moon , a golden boat , hangs dim behind the tree , O !</l>
     <l n="3">The dropping thorn makes white the grass , O ! sweetest lass ,</l>
     <l n="4">and sweetest lass</l>
     <l n="5">Come out and smell the ricks of hay adown the croft with me , O ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">With but a slight effort of memory I can vividly recall his voice and</l>
     <l n="7">manner in repeating these simple yet beautiful lines .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">They were the last verses I ever heard from the poet 's lips .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Just as the woods were assuming their first delicate autumnal tints , Timrod took his leave of us . In a conversation on the night but one previous to his departure , we had been speaking of Dr. Parr and other literary persons of unusual age , when he observed : “ I have n't the slightest desire , P ——, to be an octogenarian , far less a centenarian , like old Parr ; but I hope that I may be spared until I am FIFTY or fifty-five . ”</p>
   <p>“ About Shakespeare 's age , ” I suggested .</p>
   <p>“ Oh ! ” he replied , smiling , “ I was not thinking of THAT ; but I 'm sure that after fifty-five I would begin to wither , mind and body , and one hates the idea of a mummy , intellectual or physical . Do you remember that picture of extreme old age which Charles Reade gives us in ‘ Never Too Late to Mend ’ ? George Fielding , the hero , is about going away from England to try his luck in Australia . All his friends and relations are around him , expressing their sorrow at his enforced voyage ; all but his grandfather , aged ninety-two , who sits stolid and mumbling in his armchair .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Grandfather ! ’ shouts George into the deafened ears , ‘ I 'm going a long journey ; mayhap shall never see you again ; speak a word to me before I go ! ’ Grandfather looks up , brightens for a moment , and cackles feebly out : ‘ George , fetch me some SNUFF from where you 're going . See now ’ ( half whimpering ) , ‘ I 'm out of snuff . ’ A good point in the way of illustration , but not a pleasant picture . ”</p>
   <p>On the 13th of September , ten days after Timrod 's return to Columbia , he wrote me the following note :—</p>
   <p>“ Dear P ——: I have been too sick to write before , and am still too sick to drop you more than a few lines . You will be surprised and pained to hear that I have had a severe hemorrhage of the lungs .</p>
   <p>“ I did not come home an instant too soon . I found them without money or provisions . Fortunately I brought with me a small sum . I wo n't tell you how small , but six dollars of it was from the editor of the ‘ Opinion ’ for my last poem .</p>
   <p>“ I left your climate to my injury . But not only for the sake of my health , I begin already to look back with longing regret to ‘ Copse Hill ’ . You have all made me feel as if I had TWO beloved homes !</p>
   <p>“ I wish that I could divide myself between them ; or that I had wings , so that I might flit from one to other in a moment .</p>
   <p>“ I hope soon to write you at length . Yours , ” etc .</p>
   <p>Again on the 16th I heard from him , thus :—</p>
   <p>“ Yesterday I had a still more copious hemorrhage !...</p>
   <p>“ I am lying supine in bed , forbidden to speak or make any exertion whatever . But I can n't resist the temptation of dropping you a line , in the hope of calling forth a score or two from you in return .</p>
   <p>“ An awkward time this for me to be sick ! We are destitute of funds , almost of food . But God will provide !</p>
   <p>“ I send you a Sonnet , written the other day , as an Obituary for Mr. Harris Simons . Tell me what you think of it — be sure ! Love to your mother , wife , and my precious Willie [ since the death of his own child he had turned with a yearning affection to my boy ] . Let me hear from you soon — VERY soon ! You 'll do me more good than medicines ! ” etc .</p>
   <p>On the 25th of the month confidence in Timrod 's recovery was confirmed by a letter from Mrs. Goodwin :—</p>
   <p>“ Our brother , ” she writes , “ is decidedly better ; and if there be no recurrence of the hemorrhage will , I hope , be soon convalescent ! ”</p>
   <p>A week and upwards passed on in silence . I received no more communications from Columbia . But early in October a vaguely threatening report reached my ears . On the 9th it was mournfully confirmed . Forty-eight hours before , Henry Timrod had expired !</p>
   <p>On the 7th of October , the mortal remains of the poet , so worn and shattered , were buried in the cemetery of Trinity Church , Columbia .</p>
   <p>There , in the ruined capital of his native State , whence scholarship , culture , and social purity have been banished to give place to the orgies of semi-barbarians and the political trickery of adventurers and traitors ; there , tranquil amid the vulgar turmoil of factions , reposes the dust of one of the truest and sweetest singers this country has given to the world .</p>
   <p>Nature , kinder to his senseless ashes than ever Fortune had been to the living man , is prodigal around his grave — unmarked and unrecorded though it be — of her flowers and verdant grasses , of her rains that fertilize , and her purifying dews . The peace he loved , and so vainly longed for through stormy years , has crept to him at last , but only to fall upon the pallid eyelids , closed forever ; upon the pulseless limbs , and the breathless , broken heart . Still it is good to know that</p>
   <p>“ After life 's fitful fever , he sleeps well . ”</p>
   <p>Yet , from this mere material repose , this quiet of decaying atoms , surely the most skeptical of thinkers , in contemplation of SUCH a life and SUCH a death , must instinctively look from earth to heaven ; from the bruised and mouldering clod to the spirit infinitely exalted , and radiant in redemption .</p>
   <p>“ A calm , a beautiful , a sacred star . ”</p>
   <p>The poetic creed of Timrod , expressed in his “ Vision of Poesy ” , set the impress upon all his work . Conscious of his power , he reverently believed in the mission of the poet as prophet and teacher ,—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ The mission of Genius on Earth ! To uplift ,</l>
     <l n="2">Purify , and confirm , by its own gracious gift ,</l>
     <l n="3">The world , ” —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">and he has consecrated his gift to its noblest uses in the discharge of</l>
     <l n="5">that “ high and holy debt ” .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>As lover of man and nature , his sympathy was universal ; no theme was too humble for his pen . “ The same law that moulds a planet forms a drop of dew . ” “ Humility is power ! ” “ We may trace the mighty sun above even by the shadow of a slender flower . ” Yet he dealt not with the fleeting ; that was only the passing form of the abiding . Passionately fond as he was of Nature , and nourished and refreshed by her always , he never wrote a line of mere descriptive poetry . Nature is only the symbol , the image , to interpret his spiritual meaning . He felt with Milton , in his noble words , that the abiding work is not raised in the heat of youth or the vapors of wine , or by “ invocation to dame Memory and her siren daughters , but by devout prayer to that Eternal Spirit who can enrich with all utterance and knowledge , and send out his seraphim with the hallowed fire of his altars to touch and purify the lips of whom He pleases . ”</p>
   <p>Under that inspiration and revelation the poet is a divine interpreter of ( in his own words ) —</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ All lovely things , and gentle — the sweet laugh</l>
     <l n="2">Of children , Girlhood 's kiss , and Friendship 's clasp ,</l>
     <l n="3">The boy that sporteth with the old man 's staff ,</l>
     <l n="4">The baby , and the breast its fingers grasp —</l>
     <l n="5">All that exalts the grounds of happiness ,</l>
     <l n="6">All griefs that hallow , and all joys that bless ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">“ To me are sacred ; at my holy shrine</l>
     <l n="8">Love breathes its latest dreams , its earliest hints ;</l>
     <l n="9">I turn life 's tasteless waters into wine ,</l>
     <l n="10">And flush them through and through with purple tints .</l>
     <l n="11">Wherever Earth is fair , and Heaven looks down ,</l>
     <l n="12">I rear my altars , and I wear my crown . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>It was this mission of Poetry that filled his mind and heart and life with abiding light , which made him cling passionately to life , not because of any physical fear of death , but because in that mission Art and Nature were so inexpressibly rich and sweet to him to reveal his message to man . In the benediction of his dying words , “ Love is sweeter than rest ! ”</p>
   <p>The moral purity of these poems is their distinctive quality , as it was of the man . With a universal sympathy for all life , still he moved always on the highest planes of thought and feeling and purpose . He seemed always to be impressed in his art with the truth of his own lines ,—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ There is no unimpressive spot on earth ,</l>
     <l n="2">The beauty of the stars is over all . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">His earnestness and deep poetic insight clothed all themes with the</l>
     <l n="4">beauty and light that is in and over all .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Timrod 's melancholy , the finest test of high poetic quality , when purified and spiritualized , has no Byronic bitterness , no selfish morbidness , no impenetrable gloom , but in his own exquisite lines it is ,—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ A shadowy land , where joy and sorrow kiss ,</l>
     <l n="2">Each still to each corrective and relief ,</l>
     <l n="3">Where dim delights are brightened into bliss ,</l>
     <l n="4">And nothing wholly perishes but Grief .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ Ah , me !— not dies — no more than spirit dies ;</l>
     <l n="6">But in a change like death is clothed with wings ;</l>
     <l n="7">A serious angel , with entrancèd eyes ,</l>
     <l n="8">Looking to far off and celestial things . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Again , in all these poems there is a nameless spell of a simplicity , fervid yet tender , and an imagination , strong yet delicate , both in its perception and expression .</p>
   <p>His style , “ like noble music unto noble words , ” is elaborate , yet perfectly natural . There is no trace of labor ; grace guides and power impels . So perfect is it at times in its natural power that the mind is almost unconscious of the word-symbol in grasping immediately the thought revealed .</p>
   <p>There is in the verse a ceaseless melody and perfect finish . At times there is “ the easy elegance of Catullus ” , always his delight , and a metrical translation of whose poems he had completed .</p>
   <p>Rare endowment with broad culture is evinced in the high intellectual level always maintained ; and the evenness of quality that is always of the mountain top . He always knows his power , and its range . His song is always clear and true .</p>
   <p>Moreover , with a universality of poetic feeling , he has struck every chord , and always with a keen sensibility and delicacy of natural instinct . Among the finest poems , how wide is this range and varied this power !</p>
   <p>“ The Vision of Poesy ” , his longest work , written in youth , essaying the mission and the philosophy of the poetic art , has some lofty passages , and all the promise of his later power , felicity , and melody .</p>
   <p>“ A Year 's Courtship ” is in its glow , and grace , and music the perfection of classic art .</p>
   <p>The dainty voluptuousness in a “ Serenade ” kindles with the luxuriousness of the South .</p>
   <p>His “ Præceptor Amat ” is warm with the breath of rapturous feeling , and rich with the fragrance of flowers .</p>
   <p>“ Ethnogenesis ” , “ the birth of the nation ” , is regarded by some his greatest poem . It is prophecy linked with the hope and aspiration of the newborn nation of the South . A permanent image of the Southern nature and character is thus richly portrayed :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ But the type</l>
     <l n="2">Whereby we shall be known in every land</l>
     <l n="3">Is that vast gulf which lips our Southern strand ,</l>
     <l n="4">And through the cold , untempered ocean pours</l>
     <l n="5">Its genial streams , that far off Arctic shores</l>
     <l n="6">May sometimes catch upon the softened breeze</l>
     <l n="7">Strange tropic warmth and hints of summer seas . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ The Cotton Boll ” , in “ the snow of Southern summers ” , is a forerunner of Lanier 's “ Corn ” . It reveals the mystic spell and kingly power of that far-stretching tropic snow , and contains that glowing painting of Carolina from sea to mountain , which closes</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ No fairer land hath fired a poet 's lays ,</l>
     <l n="2">Or given a home to man ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Too Long , O Spirit of Storm ” , is the fused passion of the poet 's heart appalled at the moral death of stagnation . It has all the intensity and subtlety of Shelley .</p>
   <p>In “ The Lily Confidante ” , delicate and fanciful as it is , the reply of the Lily “ is a simple yet sacred melody ” , hallowing the purity of passion .</p>
   <p>“ The Arctic Voyager ” suggests Tennyson 's “ Ulysses ” in its high faith , lofty purpose , and sustained power .</p>
   <p>“ Spring ” is the burst of the Southern spring , in its flooding life and glory and beauty . There is “ a nameless pathos in the air . ” A wonderful revelation is going on before our eyes ! No miracle could startle in the ever new creation , so strange and rapturous is this joy of sense and spiritual rebirth .</p>
   <p>Nor was his genius only reflective , and creative , and playful ; his was a trumpet voice also . When the blast of war sounded , his voice rang like a clarion in “ Carolina ” and “ Cry to Arms ” . Beyond their local meaning , which kindles and thrills , now as then , the men of the South , they have an abiding , universal power from the standpoint of art ; for there is nothing finer in all the martial strains of the lyric .</p>
   <p>Paul Hayne , his brother poet , speaking of “ Carolina ” , as “ lines destined perhaps to outlive the political vitality of the State , whose antique fame they celebrate , ” said :—</p>
   <p>“ I read them first , and was thrilled by their power and pathos , upon a stormy March evening in Fort Sumter ! Walking along the battlements , under the red light of a tempestuous sunset , the wind steadily and loudly blowing from off the bar across the tossing and moaning waste of waters , driven inland ; with scores of gulls and white sea-birds flying and shrieking round me ,— those wild voices of Nature mingled strangely with the rhythmic roll and beat of the poet 's impassioned music . The very spirit , or dark genius , of the troubled scene appeared to take up and to repeat such verses as —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ ‘ I hear a murmur as of waves</l>
     <l n="2">That grope their way through sunless caves ,</l>
     <l n="3">Like bodies struggling in their graves ,</l>
     <l n="4">Carolina !</l>
     <l n="5">And now it deepens ; slow and grand</l>
     <l n="6">It swells , as rolling to the land ,</l>
     <l n="7">An ocean broke upon the strand ,</l>
     <l n="8">Carolina !</l>
     <l n="9">Shout ! let it reach the startled Huns !</l>
     <l n="10">And roar with all thy festal guns !</l>
     <l n="11">It is the answer of thy sons ,</l>
     <l n="12">Carolina ! ’ ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Profoundly appealing as are Timrod 's war strains , for they are the heart-cry of a people , still it should be noted that there is scarcely a battle ode that does not close with an invocation to peace , such was the lofty nature of the poet . War to him was only the drawn sword of right , and truth , and justice , which accomplished , the prayer for peace was ever on his lips , as witness the noble invocation to Peace , closing his “ Christmas ” , that has so often stirred and hushed at once the heart of the South .</p>
   <p>The Ode , written for Memorial Day , April , 1867 , of the Confederate graves at Charleston , was his last production . He had sung in lofty strains each phase of the struggle , its hope , its courage , its fear , its despair ; he now sings his latest song , a wreath of flowers upon the unmarked graves of the Southern dead , and has hallowed these sacred mounds to his people in the words ,—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ There is no holier spot of ground</l>
     <l n="2">Than where defeated valor lies ,</l>
     <l n="3">By mourning beauty crowned ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>These poems are written in the life-blood of the poet and his generation . The patriotic fire , the devoted sacrifice and splendid achievement , that “ Carolina ” , “ Cry to Arms ” , “ Unknown Dead ” , “ Carmen Triumphale ” , “ Charleston ” , “ Storm and Calm ” , and the other of the war poems celebrate were not only the rushing tide of earnest feeling of a noble people then , but are now a part of the glory and heritage of the State , of the South , and of the American republic . They were the mighty heart-beats of that great epoch . They are now irrevocable history , and make these poems a part of the abiding literature of America .</p>
   <p>“ A Common Thought ” is the poet 's premonition of his end ; but he sees no vision of the dying glory of sunset , no going out into the dark , no presentiment of a vague and gloomy voyage on a homeless sea ; but in the sunshine , in the growing light of ever broadening day , amid the joy and splendor of nature , bright prophecy and intuition of immortality , is to come the sudden , solemn mystery of the whisper , “ He is gone ! ” And so it was . For as the sun broadened into glad day , and the full radiance illumined and animated earth and sea and sky , “ as it purpled in the zenith , as it brightened on the lawn , ” this rich young life , in its own fresh morning of genius and spiritual sunshine , passed , and in his own triumphant words ,—</p>
   <p>“ not dies , no more than Spirit dies ; But in a change like death was clothed with wings . ”</p>
   <p>The Late Judge George S. Bryan</p>
   <p>It would not be fitting that this memorial edition of Timrod 's Poems should go forth to the world without proper recognition , on the part of the TIMROD MEMORIAL ASSOCIATION , of the relation occupied and the services rendered to the poet in his lifetime by the late Hon . George S. Bryan , of Charleston . During the whole of Timrod 's career Judge Bryan was his devoted friend , ever ready to assist him materially , morally , and in every other respect .</p>
   <p>His faith in Timrod 's genius never wavered , and but for his early assistance , sympathy , and encouragement , much of the fruit of that genius would have been lost or wasted . He helped him in adversity , cheered him in his hours of anxiety and despondency , and from first to last , throughout the literary and spiritual history of the poet , he did more than any other friend to keep alive in his heart the steadfast flame of faith in his poetic destiny ; Judge Bryan 's name must always be inseparably connected with Henry Timrod 's in the literary annals of South Carolina .</p>

   <p>Spring</p>

     <l n="1">Spring , with that nameless pathos in the air</l>
     <l n="2">Which dwells with all things fair ,</l>
     <l n="3">Spring , with her golden suns and silver rain ,</l>
     <l n="4">Is with us once again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Out in the lonely woods the jasmine burns</l>
     <l n="6">Its fragrant lamps , and turns</l>
     <l n="7">Into a royal court with green festoons</l>
     <l n="8">The banks of dark lagoons .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">In the deep heart of every forest tree</l>
     <l n="10">The blood is all aglee ,</l>
     <l n="11">And there 's a look about the leafless bowers</l>
     <l n="12">As if they dreamed of flowers .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Yet still on every side we trace the hand</l>
     <l n="14">Of Winter in the land ,</l>
     <l n="15">Save where the maple reddens on the lawn ,</l>
     <l n="16">Flushed by the season 's dawn ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Or where , like those strange semblances we find</l>
     <l n="18">That age to childhood bind ,</l>
     <l n="19">The elm puts on , as if in Nature 's scorn ,</l>
     <l n="20">The brown of Autumn corn .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">As yet the turf is dark , although you know</l>
     <l n="22">That , not a span below ,</l>
     <l n="23">A thousand germs are groping through the gloom ,</l>
     <l n="24">And soon will burst their tomb .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">Already , here and there , on frailest stems</l>
     <l n="26">Appear some azure gems ,</l>
     <l n="27">Small as might deck , upon a gala day ,</l>
     <l n="28">The forehead of a fay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">In gardens you may note amid the dearth</l>
     <l n="30">The crocus breaking earth ;</l>
     <l n="31">And near the snowdrop 's tender white and green ,</l>
     <l n="32">The violet in its screen .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">But many gleams and shadows need must pass</l>
     <l n="34">Along the budding grass ,</l>
     <l n="35">And weeks go by , before the enamored South</l>
     <l n="36">Shall kiss the rose 's mouth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">Still there 's a sense of blossoms yet unborn</l>
     <l n="38">In the sweet airs of morn ;</l>

     <l n="40">Grow purple at his feet .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">At times a fragrant breeze comes floating by ,</l>
     <l n="42">And brings , you know not why ,</l>
     <l n="43">A feeling as when eager crowds await</l>
     <l n="44">Before a palace gate</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="45">Some wondrous pageant ; and you scarce would start ,</l>

     <l n="53">Yet not more surely shall the Spring awake</l>

     <l n="56">A million men to arms .</l>

     <l n="57">There shall be deeper hues upon her plains</l>

     <l n="65">And calling , with the voice of all her rills ,</l>
     <l n="66">Upon the ancient hills</l>

     <l n="90">The landscape broadens on my sight ,</l>
     <l n="91">As , in the little boll , there lurked a spell</l>
     <l n="92">Like that which , in the ocean shell ,</l>
     <l n="93">With mystic sound ,</l>
     <l n="94">Breaks down the narrow walls that hem us round ,</l>
     <l n="95">And turns some city lane</l>

     <l n="113">Is lost afar</l>

     <l n="190">In offices like these , thy mission lies ,</l>

     <l n="193">In blue above thee ; though thy foes be hard</l>
     <l n="194">And cruel as their weapons , it shall guard</l>
     <l n="195">Thy hearth-stones as a bulwark ; make thee great</l>
     <l n="196">In white and bloodless state ;</l>
     <l n="197">And haply , as the years increase —</l>
     <l n="198">Still working through its humbler reach</l>
     <l n="199">With that large wisdom which the ages teach —</l>
     <l n="200">Revive the half-dead dream of universal peace !</l>
     <l n="201">As men who labor in that mine</l>
     <l n="202">Of Cornwall , hollowed out beneath the bed</l>
     <l n="203">Of ocean , when a storm rolls overhead ,</l>
     <l n="204">Hear the dull booming of the world of brine</l>

     <l n="206">Of winds and waters , yet toil calmly on ,</l>
     <l n="207">And split the rock , and pile the massive ore ,</l>
     <l n="208">Or carve a niche , or shape the archëd roof ;</l>
     <l n="209">So I , as calmly , weave my woof</l>
     <l n="210">Of song , chanting the days to come ,</l>
     <l n="211">Unsilenced , though the quiet summer air</l>
     <l n="212">Stirs with the bruit of battles , and each dawn</l>
     <l n="213">Wakes from its starry silence to the hum</l>
     <l n="214">Of many gathering armies . Still ,</l>
     <l n="215">In that we sometimes hear ,</l>
     <l n="216">Upon the Northern winds , the voice of woe</l>
     <l n="217">Not wholly drowned in triumph , though I know</l>
     <l n="218">The end must crown us , and a few brief years</l>

     <l n="225">Delay our just release !</l>
     <l n="226">And , if it may be , save</l>
     <l n="227">These sacred fields of peace</l>
     <l n="228">From stain of patriot or of hostile blood !</l>
     <l n="229">Oh , help us , Lord ! to roll the crimson flood</l>
     <l n="230">Back on its course , and , while our banners wing</l>
     <l n="231">Northward , strike with us ! till the Goth shall cling</l>
     <l n="232">To his own blasted altar-stones , and crave</l>
     <l n="233">Mercy ; and we shall grant it , and dictate</l>
     <l n="234">The lenient future of his fate</l>
     <l n="235">There , where some rotting ships and crumbling quays</l>

     <l n="355">Yet so hopeless , yet so cureless — as in every great despair —</l>
     <l n="356">I was very calm and silent , and I never stooped to prayer ,</l>
     <l n="357">Like a sick man unattended , reckless of the coming death ,</l>
     <l n="358">Only for he knows it certain , and he feels no sister 's breath .</l>

     <l n="361">I was haunted by thy presence , oh ! for weary nights and days ,</l>
     <l n="362">I was haunted by thy spirit , I was troubled by thy gaze ,</l>
     <l n="363">And the question which to answer I had taxed a subtle brain ,</l>
     <l n="364">What thou art , and what thou wilt be , came again and yet again ;</l>
     <l n="365">With its opposite deductions , it recurred a thousand times ,</l>
     <l n="366">Like a coward 's apprehensions , like a madman 's favorite rhymes .</l>

     <l n="369">And thy fingers sweep the paper , and a light is in thine eyes ,</l>
     <l n="370">Whilst I read thy secret fancies , whilst I hear thy secret sighs .</l>
     <l n="371">What they are I will not whisper , those are lovely , these are deep ,</l>
     <l n="372">But one name is left unwritten , that is only breathed in sleep .</l>

     <l n="377">Aye ! I hear thy haughty answer ! Aye ! I see thy proud lip curl !</l>
     <l n="378">“ What presumption , and what folly ! ” why , I only love a girl</l>
     <l n="379">With some very winning graces , with some very noble traits ,</l>
     <l n="380">But no better than a thousand who have bent to humbler fates .</l>
     <l n="381">That I ask not ; I have , maiden , just as haught a soul as thine ;</l>
     <l n="382">If thou think'st thy place above me , thou shalt never stoop to mine .</l>
     <l n="383">Yet as long as blood runs redly , yet as long as mental worth</l>
     <l n="384">Is a nobler gift than fortune , is a holier thing than birth ,</l>
     <l n="385">I will claim the right to utter , to the high and to the low ,</l>
     <l n="386">That I love them , or I hate them , that I am a friend or foe .</l>
     <l n="387">Nor shall any slight unman me ; I have yet some little strength ,</l>
     <l n="388">Yet my song shall sound as sweetly , yet a power be mine at length !</l>
     <l n="389">Then , oh , then ! but moans are idle — hear me , pitying saints above !</l>
     <l n="390">With a chaplet on my forehead , I will justify my love .</l>
     <l n="391">And perhaps when thou art leaning on some less devoted breast ,</l>
     <l n="392">Thou shalt murmur , “ He was worthier than my blinded spirit guessed . ”</l>

     <l n="287">Now sink in mats of clover sweet ,</l>

     <l n="289">The lark go up to greet the dawn !</l>
     <l n="290">All birds that love the English sky</l>

     <l n="333">Did much as other maidens do —</l>
     <l n="334">Across the pews and down the aisle</l>
     <l n="335">Sent many a beau-bewildering smile ,</l>

      <l n="1805">For peace , and found it , secret , hushed , and cool ,</l>
      <l n="1806">A beautiful recess in neighboring woods .</l>
      <l n="1807">Trees of the soberest hues , thick-leaved and tall ,</l>
      <l n="1808">Arch it o'erhead and column it around ,</l>
      <l n="1809">Framing a covert , natural and wild ,</l>
      <l n="1810">Domelike and dim ; though nowhere so enclosed</l>
      <l n="1811">But that the gentlest breezes reach the spot</l>
      <l n="1812">Unwearied and unweakened . Sound is here</l>

      <l n="1815">Whilst the high pines in one another 's arms</l>

      <l n="1817">Catch the far fall of voices , how remote</l>
      <l n="1818">You know not , and you do not care to know .</l>
      <l n="1819">The turf is soft and green , but not a flower</l>

      <l n="1821">I do not know its name — which here and there</l>
      <l n="1822">Gleams like a sapphire set in emerald .</l>
      <l n="1823">A narrow opening in the branchëd roof ,</l>
      <l n="1824">A single one , is large enough to show ,</l>

      <l n="1826">The blue air and the blessing of the sky .</l>
      <l n="1827">Thither I always bent my idle steps ,</l>
      <l n="1828">When griefs depressed , or joys disturbed my heart ,</l>
      <l n="1829">And found the calm I looked for , or returned</l>

      <l n="1841">Not a leaf</l>
      <l n="1842">Stirred with the whispering welcome which I sought ,</l>

      <l n="1844">Every fair plant and implicated bough</l>
      <l n="1845">Hung lax and lifeless . Something in the place ,</l>
      <l n="1846">Its utter stillness , the unusual heat ,</l>
      <l n="1847">And some more secret influence , I thought ,</l>
      <l n="1848">Weighed on the sense like sin . Above I saw ,</l>
      <l n="1849">Though not a cloud was visible in heaven ,</l>
      <l n="1850">The pallid sky look through a glazëd mist</l>

      <l n="1852">The change , perhaps ,</l>

      <l n="1854">The weather , and the time explain it all :</l>

      <l n="1889">Then , sick at heart , and angered by the book ,</l>
      <l n="1890">Which , in good sooth , was but the long-drawn sigh</l>

      <l n="1897">Watched lazily the shadows of my brain .</l>
      <l n="1898">The feeble tide of peevishness went down ,</l>
      <l n="1899">And left a flat dull waste of dreary pain ,</l>
      <l n="1900">Which seemed to clog the blood in every vein ;</l>
      <l n="1901">The world , of course , put on its darkest frown —</l>

      <l n="1907">Even that would bare its bosom to a shower ,</l>
