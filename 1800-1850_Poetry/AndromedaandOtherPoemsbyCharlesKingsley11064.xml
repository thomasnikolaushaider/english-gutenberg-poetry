      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">Over the sea , past Crete , on the Syrian shore to the southward ,</l>
       <l n="3">Dwells in the well-tilled lowland a dark-haired AEthiop people ,</l>
       <l n="4">Skilful with needle and loom , and the arts of the dyer and carver ,</l>
       <l n="5">Skilful , but feeble of heart ; for they know not the lords of Olympus ,</l>
       <l n="6">Lovers of men ; neither broad-browed Zeus , nor Pallas Athene ,</l>
       <l n="7">Teacher of wisdom to heroes , bestower of might in the battle ;</l>
       <l n="8">Share not the cunning of Hermes , nor list to the songs of Apollo .</l>
       <l n="9">Fearing the stars of the sky , and the roll of the blue salt water ,</l>
       <l n="10">Fearing all things that have life in the womb of the seas and the livers ,</l>
       <l n="11">Eating no fish to this day , nor ploughing the main , like the Phoenics ,</l>
       <l n="12">Manful with black-beaked ships , they abide in a sorrowful region ,</l>
       <l n="13">Vexed with the earthquake , and flame , and the sea-floods , scourge of</l>
       <l n="14">Poseidon .</l>
       <l n="15">Whelming the dwellings of men , and the toils of the slow-footed oxen ,</l>
       <l n="16">Drowning the barley and flax , and the hard-earned gold of the harvest ,</l>
       <l n="17">Up to the hillside vines , and the pastures skirting the woodland ,</l>
       <l n="18">Inland the floods came yearly ; and after the waters a monster ,</l>
       <l n="19">Bred of the slime , like the worms which are bred from the slime of the Nile-</l>
       <l n="20">bank ,</l>
       <l n="21">Shapeless , a terror to see ; and by night it swam out to the seaward ,</l>
       <l n="22">Daily returning to feed with the dawn , and devoured of the fairest ,</l>
       <l n="23">Cattle , and children , and maids , till the terrified people fled inland .</l>
       <l n="24">Fasting in sackcloth and ashes they came , both the king and his people ,</l>
       <l n="25">Came to the mountain of oaks , to the house of the terrible sea-gods ,</l>
       <l n="26">Hard by the gulf in the rocks , where of old the world-wide deluge</l>
       <l n="27">Sank to the inner abyss ; and the lake where the fish of the goddess ,</l>
       <l n="28">Holy , undying , abide ; whom the priests feed daily with dainties .</l>
       <l n="29">There to the mystical fish , high-throned in her chamber of cedar ,</l>
       <l n="30">Burnt they the fat of the flock ; till the flame shone far to the seaward .</l>
       <l n="31">Three days fasting they prayed ; but the fourth day the priests of the</l>
       <l n="32">goddess ,</l>
       <l n="33">Cunning in spells , cast lots , to discover the crime of the people .</l>
       <l n="34">All day long they cast , till the house of the monarch was taken ,</l>
       <l n="35">Cepheus , king of the land ; and the faces of all gathered blackness .</l>
       <l n="36">Then once more they cast ; and Cassiopoeia was taken ,</l>
       <l n="37">Deep-bosomed wife of the king , whom oft far-seeing Apollo</l>
       <l n="38">Watched well-pleased from the welkin , the fairest of AEthiop women :</l>
       <l n="39">Fairest , save only her daughter ; for down to the ankle her tresses</l>
       <l n="40">Rolled , blue-black as the night , ambrosial , joy to beholders .</l>
       <l n="41">Awful and fair she arose , most like in her coming to Here ,</l>
       <l n="42">Queen before whom the Immortals arise , as she comes on Olympus ,</l>
       <l n="43">Out of the chamber of gold , which her son Hephaestos has wrought her .</l>
       <l n="44">Such in her stature and eyes , and the broad white light of her forehead .</l>
       <l n="45">Stately she came from her place , and she spoke in the midst of the people .</l>
       <l n="46">‘ Pure are my hands from blood : most pure this heart in my bosom .</l>
       <l n="47">Yet one fault I remember this day ; one word have I spoken ;</l>
       <l n="48">Rashly I spoke on the shore , and I dread lest the sea should have heard it .</l>
       <l n="49">Watching my child at her bath , as she plunged in the joy of her girlhood ,</l>
       <l n="50">Fairer I called her in pride than Atergati , queen of the ocean .</l>
       <l n="51">Judge ye if this be my sin , for I know none other . ’ She ended ;</l>
       <l n="52">Wrapping her head in her mantle she stood , and the people were silent .</l>
       <l n="53">Answered the dark-browed priests , ‘ No word , once spoken , returneth ,</l>
       <l n="54">Even if uttered unwitting . Shall gods excuse our rashness ?</l>
       <l n="55">That which is done , that abides ; and the wrath of the sea is against us ;</l>
       <l n="56">Hers , and the wrath of her brother , the Sun-god , lord of the sheepfolds .</l>
       <l n="57">Fairer than her hast thou boasted thy daughter ? Ah folly ! for hateful ,</l>
       <l n="58">Hateful are they to the gods , whoso , impious , liken a mortal ,</l>
       <l n="59">Fair though he be , to their glory ; and hateful is that which is likened ,</l>
       <l n="60">Grieving the eyes of their pride , and abominate , doomed to their anger .</l>
       <l n="61">What shall be likened to gods ? The unknown , who deep in the darkness</l>
       <l n="62">Ever abide , twyformed , many-handed , terrible , shapeless .</l>
       <l n="63">Woe to the queen ; for the land is defiled , and the people accursed .</l>
       <l n="64">Take thou her therefore by night , thou ill-starred Cassiopoeia ,</l>
       <l n="65">Take her with us in the night , when the moon sinks low to the westward ;</l>
       <l n="66">Bind her aloft for a victim , a prey for the gorge of the monster ,</l>
       <l n="67">Far on the sea-girt rock , which is washed by the surges for ever ;</l>
       <l n="68">So may the goddess accept her , and so may the land make atonement ,</l>
       <l n="69">Purged by her blood from its sin : so obey thou the doom of the rulers . ’</l>
       <l n="70">Bitter in soul they went out , Cepheus and Cassiopoeia ,</l>
       <l n="71">Bitter in soul ; and their hearts whirled round , as the leaves in the eddy .</l>
       <l n="72">Weak was the queen , and rebelled : but the king , like a shepherd of people ,</l>
       <l n="73">Willed not the land should waste ; so he yielded the life of his daughter .</l>
       <l n="74">Deep in the wane of the night , as the moon sank low to the westward ,</l>
       <l n="75">They by the shade of the cliffs , with the horror of darkness around them ,</l>
       <l n="76">Stole , as ashamed , to a deed which became not the light of the sunshine ,</l>
       <l n="77">Slowly , the priests , and the queen , and the virgin bound in the galley ,</l>
       <l n="78">Slowly they rowed to the rocks : but Cepheus far in the palace</l>
       <l n="79">Sate in the midst of the hall , on his throne , like a shepherd of people ,</l>
       <l n="80">Choking his woe , dry-eyed , while the slaves wailed loudly around him .</l>
       <l n="81">They on the sea-girt rock , which is washed by the surges for ever ,</l>
       <l n="82">Set her in silence , the guiltless , aloft with her face to the eastward .</l>
       <l n="83">Under a crag of the stone , where a ledge sloped down to the water ;</l>
       <l n="84">There they set Andromeden , most beautiful , shaped like a goddess ,</l>
       <l n="85">Lifting her long white arms wide-spread to the walls of the basalt ,</l>
       <l n="86">Chaining them , ruthless , with brass ; and they called on the might of the</l>
       <l n="87">Rulers .</l>
       <l n="88">‘ Mystical fish of the seas , dread Queen whom AEthiops honour ,</l>
       <l n="89">Whelming the land in thy wrath , unavoidable , sharp as the sting-ray ,</l>
       <l n="90">Thou , and thy brother the Sun , brain-smiting , lord of the sheepfold ,</l>
       <l n="91">Scorching the earth all day , and then resting at night in thy bosom ,</l>
       <l n="92">Take ye this one life for many , appeased by the blood of a maiden ,</l>
       <l n="93">Fairest , and born of the fairest , a queen , most priceless of victims . ’</l>
       <l n="94">Thrice they spat as they went by the maid : but her mother delaying</l>
       <l n="95">Fondled her child to the last , heart-crushed ; and the warmth of her weeping</l>
       <l n="96">Fell on the breast of the maid , as her woe broke forth into wailing .</l>
       <l n="97">‘ Daughter ! my daughter ! forgive me ! Oh curse not the murderess ! Curse</l>
       <l n="98">not !</l>
       <l n="99">How have I sinned , but in love ? Do the gods grudge glory to mothers ?</l>
       <l n="100">Loving I bore thee in vain in the fate-cursed bride-bed of Cepheus ,</l>
       <l n="101">Loving I fed thee and tended , and loving rejoiced in thy beauty ,</l>
       <l n="102">Blessing thy limbs as I bathed them , and blessing thy locks as I combed them ;</l>
       <l n="103">Decking thee , ripening to woman , I blest thee : yet blessing I slew thee !</l>
       <l n="104">How have I sinned , but in love ? Oh swear to me , swear to thy mother ,</l>
       <l n="105">Never to haunt me with curse , as I go to the grave in my sorrow ,</l>
       <l n="106">Childless and lone : may the gods never send me another , to slay it !</l>
       <l n="107">See , I embrace thy knees — soft knees , where no babe will be fondled —</l>
       <l n="108">Swear to me never to curse me , the hapless one , not in the death-pang . ’</l>
       <l n="109">Weeping she clung to the knees of the maid ; and the maid low answered —</l>
       <l n="110">‘ Curse thee ! Not in the death-pang ! ’ The heart of the lady was lightened .</l>
       <l n="111">Slowly she went by the ledge ; and the maid was alone in the darkness .</l>
       <l n="112">Watching the pulse of the oars die down , as her own died with them ,</l>
       <l n="113">Tearless , dumb with amaze she stood , as a storm-stunned nestling</l>
       <l n="114">Fallen from bough or from eave lies dumb , which the home-going herdsman</l>
       <l n="115">Fancies a stone , till he catches the light of its terrified eyeball .</l>
       <l n="116">So through the long long hours the maid stood helpless and hopeless ,</l>
       <l n="117">Wide-eyed , downward gazing in vain at the black blank darkness .</l>
       <l n="118">Feebly at last she began , while wild thoughts bubbled within her —</l>
       <l n="119">‘ Guiltless I am : why thus , then ? Are gods more ruthless than mortals ?</l>
       <l n="120">Have they no mercy for youth ? no love for the souls who have loved them ?</l>
       <l n="121">Even as I loved thee , dread sea , as I played by thy margin ,</l>
       <l n="122">Blessing thy wave as it cooled me , thy wind as it breathed on my forehead ,</l>
       <l n="123">Bowing my head to thy tempest , and opening my heart to thy children ,</l>
       <l n="124">Silvery fish , wreathed shell , and the strange lithe things of the water ,</l>
       <l n="125">Tenderly casting them back , as they gasped on the beach in the sunshine ,</l>
       <l n="126">Home to their mother — in vain ! for mine sits childless in anguish !</l>
       <l n="127">O false sea ! false sea ! I dreamed what I dreamed of thy goodness ;</l>
       <l n="128">Dreamed of a smile in thy gleam , of a laugh in the plash of thy ripple :</l>
       <l n="129">False and devouring thou art , and the great world dark and despiteful . ’</l>
       <l n="130">Awed by her own rash words she was still : and her eyes to the seaward</l>
       <l n="131">Looked for an answer of wrath : far off , in the heart of the darkness ,</l>
       <l n="132">Blight white mists rose slowly ; beneath them the wandering ocean</l>
       <l n="133">Glimmered and glowed to the deepest abyss ; and the knees of the maiden</l>
       <l n="134">Trembled and sunk in her fear , as afar , like a dawn in the midnight ,</l>
       <l n="135">Rose from their seaweed chamber the choir of the mystical sea-maids .</l>
       <l n="136">Onward toward her they came , and her heart beat loud at their coming ,</l>
       <l n="137">Watching the bliss of the gods , as they wakened the cliffs with their</l>
       <l n="138">laughter .</l>
       <l n="139">Onward they came in their joy , and before them the roll of the surges</l>
       <l n="140">Sank , as the breeze sank dead , into smooth green foam-flecked marble ,</l>
       <l n="141">Awed ; and the crags of the cliff , and the pines of the mountain were silent .</l>
       <l n="142">Onward they came in their joy , and around them the lamps of the sea-nymphs ,</l>
       <l n="143">Myriad fiery globes , swam panting and heaving ; and rainbows</l>
       <l n="144">Crimson and azure and emerald , were broken in star-showers , lighting</l>
       <l n="145">Far through the wine-dark depths of the crystal , the gardens of Nereus ,</l>
       <l n="146">Coral and sea-fan and tangle , the blooms and the palms of the ocean .</l>
       <l n="147">Onward they came in their joy , more white than the foam which they</l>
       <l n="148">scattered ,</l>
       <l n="149">Laughing and singing , and tossing and twining , while eager , the Tritons</l>
       <l n="150">Blinded with kisses their eyes , unreproved , and above them in worship</l>
       <l n="151">Hovered the terns , and the seagulls swept past them on silvery pinions</l>
       <l n="152">Echoing softly their laughter ; around them the wantoning dolphins</l>
       <l n="153">Sighed as they plunged , full of love ; and the great sea-horses which bore</l>
       <l n="154">them</l>
       <l n="155">Curved up their crests in their pride to the delicate arms of the maidens ,</l>
       <l n="156">Pawing the spray into gems , till a fiery rainfall , unharming ,</l>
       <l n="157">Sparkled and gleamed on the limbs of the nymphs , and the coils of the mermen .</l>
       <l n="158">Onward they went in their joy , bathed round with the fiery coolness ,</l>
       <l n="159">Needing nor sun nor moon , self-lighted , immortal : but others ,</l>
       <l n="160">Pitiful , floated in silence apart ; in their bosoms the sea-boys ,</l>
       <l n="161">Slain by the wrath of the seas , swept down by the anger of Nereus ;</l>
       <l n="162">Hapless , whom never again on strand or on quay shall their mothers</l>
       <l n="163">Welcome with garlands and vows to the temple , but wearily pining</l>
       <l n="164">Gaze over island and bay for the sails of the sunken ; they heedless</l>
       <l n="165">Sleep in soft bosoms for ever , and dream of the surge and the sea-maids .</l>
       <l n="166">Onward they passed in their joy ; on their brows neither sorrow nor anger ;</l>
       <l n="167">Self-sufficing , as gods , never heeding the woe of the maiden .</l>
       <l n="168">She would have shrieked for their mercy : but shame made her dumb ; and their</l>
       <l n="169">eyeballs</l>
       <l n="170">Stared on her careless and still , like the eyes in the house of the idols .</l>
       <l n="171">Seeing they saw not , and passed , like a dream , on the murmuring ripple .</l>
       <l n="172">Stunned by the wonder she gazed , wide-eyed , as the glory departed .</l>
       <l n="173">‘ O fair shapes ! far fairer than I ! Too fair to be ruthless !</l>
       <l n="174">Gladden mine eyes once more with your splendour , unlike to my fancies ;</l>
       <l n="175">You , then , smiled in the sea-gleam , and laughed in the plash of the ripple .</l>
       <l n="176">Awful I deemed you and formless ; inhuman , monstrous as idols ;</l>
       <l n="177">Lo , when ye came , ye were women , more loving and lovelier , only ;</l>
       <l n="178">Like in all else ; and I blest you : why blest ye not me for my worship ?</l>
       <l n="179">Had you no mercy for me , thus guiltless ? Ye pitied the sea-boys :</l>
       <l n="180">Why not me , then , more hapless by far ? Does your sight and your knowledge</l>
       <l n="181">End with the marge of the waves ? Is the world which ye dwell in not our</l>
       <l n="182">world ? ’</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="183">Over the mountain aloft ran a rush and a roll and a roaring ;</l>
       <l n="184">Downward the breeze came indignant , and leapt with a howl to the water ,</l>
       <l n="185">Roaring in cranny and crag , till the pillars and clefts of the basalt</l>
       <l n="186">Rang like a god-swept lyre , and her brain grew mad with the noises ;</l>
       <l n="187">Crashing and lapping of waters , and sighing and tossing of weed-beds ,</l>
       <l n="188">Gurgle and whisper and hiss of the foam , while thundering surges</l>
       <l n="189">Boomed in the wave-worn halls , as they champed at the roots of the mountain .</l>
       <l n="190">Hour after hour in the darkness the wind rushed fierce to the landward ,</l>
       <l n="191">Drenching the maiden with spray ; she shivering , weary and drooping ,</l>
       <l n="192">Stood with her heart full of thoughts , till the foam-crests gleamed in the</l>
       <l n="193">twilight ,</l>
       <l n="194">Leaping and laughing around , and the east grew red with the dawning .</l>
       <l n="195">Then on the ridge of the hills rose the broad bright sun in his glory ,</l>
       <l n="196">Hurling his arrows abroad on the glittering crests of the surges ,</l>
       <l n="197">Gilding the soft round bosoms of wood , and the downs of the coastland ;</l>
       <l n="198">Gilding the weeds at her feet , and the foam-laced teeth of the ledges ,</l>
       <l n="199">Showing the maiden her home through the veil of her locks , as they floated</l>
       <l n="200">Glistening , damp with the spray , in a long black cloud to the landward .</l>
       <l n="201">High in the far-off glens rose thin blue curls from the homesteads ;</l>
       <l n="202">Softly the low of the herds , and the pipe of the outgoing herdsman ,</l>
       <l n="203">Slid to her ear on the water , and melted her heart into weeping .</l>
       <l n="204">Shuddering , she tried to forget them ; and straining her eyes to the seaward ,</l>
       <l n="205">Watched for her doom , as she wailed , but in vain , to the terrible Sun-god .</l>
       <l n="206">‘ Dost thou not pity me , Sun , though thy wild dark sister be ruthless ;</l>
       <l n="207">Dost thou not pity me here , as thou seest me desolate , weary ,</l>
       <l n="208">Sickened with shame and despair , like a kid torn young from its mother ?</l>
       <l n="209">What if my beauty insult thee , then blight it : but me — Oh spare me !</l>
       <l n="210">Spare me yet , ere he be here , fierce , tearing , unbearable ! See me ,</l>
       <l n="211">See me , how tender and soft , and thus helpless ! See how I shudder ,</l>
       <l n="212">Fancying only my doom . Wilt thou shine thus bright , when it takes me ?</l>
       <l n="213">Are there no deaths save this , great Sun ? No fiery arrow ,</l>
       <l n="214">Lightning , or deep-mouthed wave ? Why thus ? What music in shrieking ,</l>
       <l n="215">Pleasure in warm live limbs torn slowly ? And dar'st thou behold them !</l>
       <l n="216">Oh , thou hast watched worse deeds ! All sights are alike to thy brightness !</l>
       <l n="217">What if thou waken the birds to their song , dost thou waken no sorrow ;</l>
       <l n="218">Waken no sick to their pain ; no captive to wrench at his fetters ?</l>
       <l n="219">Smile on the garden and fold , and on maidens who sing at the milking ;</l>
       <l n="220">Flash into tapestried chambers , and peep in the eyelids of lovers ,</l>
       <l n="221">Showing the blissful their bliss — Dost love , then , the place where thou</l>
       <l n="222">smilest ?</l>
       <l n="223">Lovest thou cities aflame , fierce blows , and the shrieks of the widow ?</l>
       <l n="224">Lovest thou corpse-strewn fields , as thou lightest the path of the vulture ?</l>
       <l n="225">Lovest thou these , that thou gazest so gay on my tears , and my mother 's ,</l>
       <l n="226">Laughing alike at the horror of one , and the bliss of another ?</l>
       <l n="227">What dost thou care , in thy sky , for the joys and the sorrows of mortals ?</l>
       <l n="228">Colder art thou than the nymphs : in thy broad bright eye is no seeing .</l>
       <l n="229">Hadst thou a soul — as much soul as the slaves in the house of my father ,</l>
       <l n="230">Wouldst thou not save ? Poor thralls ! they pitied me , clung to me weeping ,</l>
       <l n="231">Kissing my hands and my feet — What , are gods more ruthless than mortals ?</l>
       <l n="232">Worse than the souls which they rule ? Let me die : they war not with ashes ! ’</l>
       <l n="233">Sudden she ceased , with a shriek : in the spray , like a hovering foam-bow ,</l>
       <l n="234">Hung , more fair than the foam-bow , a boy in the bloom of his manhood ,</l>
       <l n="235">Golden-haired , ivory-limbed , ambrosial ; over his shoulder</l>
       <l n="236">Hung for a veil of his beauty the gold-fringed folds of the goat-skin ,</l>
       <l n="237">Bearing the brass of his shield , as the sun flashed clear on its clearness .</l>
       <l n="238">Curved on his thigh lay a falchion , and under the gleam of his helmet</l>
       <l n="239">Eyes more blue than the main shone awful ; around him Athene</l>
       <l n="240">Shed in her love such grace , such state , and terrible daring .</l>
       <l n="241">Hovering over the water he came , upon glittering pinions ,</l>
       <l n="242">Living , a wonder , outgrown from the tight-laced gold of his sandals ;</l>
       <l n="243">Bounding from billow to billow , and sweeping the crests like a sea-gull ;</l>
       <l n="244">Leaping the gulfs of the surge , as he laughed in the joy of his leaping .</l>
       <l n="245">Fair and majestic he sprang to the rock ; and the maiden in wonder</l>
       <l n="246">Gazed for a while , and then hid in the dark-rolling wave of her tresses ,</l>
       <l n="247">Fearful , the light of her eyes ; while the boy ( for her sorrow had awed him )</l>
       <l n="248">Blushed at her blushes , and vanished , like mist on the cliffs at the sunrise .</l>
       <l n="249">Fearful at length she looked forth : he was gone : she , wild with amazement ,</l>
       <l n="250">Wailed for her mother aloud : but the wail of the wind only answered .</l>
       <l n="251">Sudden he flashed into sight , by her side ; in his pity and anger</l>
       <l n="252">Moist were his eyes ; and his breath like a rose-bed , as bolder and bolder ,</l>
       <l n="253">Hovering under her brows , like a swallow that haunts by the house-eaves ,</l>
       <l n="254">Delicate-handed , he lifted the veil of her hair ; while the maiden</l>
       <l n="255">Motionless , frozen with fear , wept loud ; till his lips unclosing</l>
       <l n="256">Poured from their pearl-strung portal the musical wave of his wonder .</l>
       <l n="257">‘ Ah , well spoke she , the wise one , the gray-eyed Pallas Athene ,—</l>
       <l n="258">Known to Immortals alone are the prizes which lie for the heroes</l>
       <l n="259">Ready prepared at their feet ; for requiring a little , the rulers</l>
       <l n="260">Pay back the loan tenfold to the man who , careless of pleasure ,</l>
       <l n="261">Thirsting for honour and toil , fares forth on a perilous errand</l>
       <l n="262">Led by the guiding of gods , and strong in the strength of Immortals .</l>
       <l n="263">Thus have they led me to thee : from afar , unknowing , I marked thee ,</l>
       <l n="264">Shining , a snow-white cross on the dark-green walls of the sea-cliff ;</l>
       <l n="265">Carven in marble I deemed thee , a perfect work of the craftsman .</l>
       <l n="266">Likeness of Amphitrite , or far-famed Queen Cythereia .</l>
       <l n="267">Curious I came , till I saw how thy tresses streamed in the sea-wind ,</l>
       <l n="268">Glistening , black as the night , and thy lips moved slow in thy wailing .</l>
       <l n="269">Speak again now — Oh speak ! For my soul is stirred to avenge thee ;</l>
       <l n="270">Tell me what barbarous horde , without law , unrighteous and heartless ,</l>
       <l n="271">Hateful to gods and to men , thus have bound thee , a shame to the sunlight ,</l>
       <l n="272">Scorn and prize to the sailor : but my prize now ; for a coward ,</l>
       <l n="273">Coward and shameless were he , who so finding a glorious jewel</l>
       <l n="274">Cast on the wayside by fools , would not win it and keep it and wear it ,</l>
       <l n="275">Even as I will thee ; for I swear by the head of my father ,</l>
       <l n="276">Bearing thee over the sea-wave , to wed thee in Argos the fruitful ,</l>
       <l n="277">Beautiful , meed of my toil no less than this head which I carry ,</l>
       <l n="278">Hidden here fearful — Oh speak ! ’</l>
       <l n="279">But the maid , still dumb with amazement ,</l>
       <l n="280">Watered her bosom with weeping , and longed for her home and her mother .</l>
       <l n="281">Beautiful , eager , he wooed her , and kissed off her tears as he hovered ,</l>
       <l n="282">Roving at will , as a bee , on the brows of a rock nymph-haunted ,</l>
       <l n="283">Garlanded over with vine , and acanthus , and clambering roses ,</l>
       <l n="284">Cool in the fierce still noon , where streams glance clear in the mossbeds ,</l>
       <l n="285">Hums on from blossom to blossom , and mingles the sweets as he tastes them .</l>
       <l n="286">Beautiful , eager , he kissed her , and clasped her yet closer and closer ,</l>
       <l n="287">Praying her still to speak —</l>
       <l n="288">‘ Not cruel nor rough did my mother</l>
       <l n="289">Bear me to broad-browed Zeus in the depths of the brass-covered dungeon ;</l>
       <l n="290">Neither in vain , as I think , have I talked with the cunning of Hermes ,</l>
       <l n="291">Face unto face , as a friend ; or from gray-eyed Pallas Athene</l>
       <l n="292">Learnt what is fit , and respecting myself , to respect in my dealings</l>
       <l n="293">Those whom the gods should love ; so fear not ; to chaste espousals</l>
       <l n="294">Only I woo thee , and swear , that a queen , and alone without rival</l>
       <l n="295">By me thou sittest in Argos of Hellas , throne of my fathers ,</l>
       <l n="296">Worshipped by fair-haired kings : why callest thou still on thy mother ?</l>
       <l n="297">Why did she leave thee thus here ? For no foeman has bound thee ; no foeman</l>
       <l n="298">Winning with strokes of the sword such a prize , would so leave it behind</l>
       <l n="299">him . ’</l>
       <l n="300">Just as at first some colt , wild-eyed , with quivering nostril ,</l>
       <l n="301">Plunges in fear of the curb , and the fluttering robes of the rider ;</l>
       <l n="302">Soon , grown bold by despair , submits to the will of his master ,</l>
       <l n="303">Tamer and tamer each hour , and at last , in the pride of obedience ,</l>
       <l n="304">Answers the heel with a curvet , and arches his neck to be fondled ,</l>
       <l n="305">Cowed by the need that maid grew tame ; while the hero indignant</l>
       <l n="306">Tore at the fetters which held her : the brass , too cunningly tempered ,</l>
       <l n="307">Held to the rock by the nails , deep wedged : till the boy , red with anger ,</l>
       <l n="308">Drew from his ivory thigh , keen flashing , a falchion of diamond —</l>
       <l n="309">‘ Now let the work of the smith try strength with the arms of Immortals ! ’</l>
       <l n="310">Dazzling it fell ; and the blade , as the vine-hook shears off the vine-bough ,</l>
       <l n="311">Carved through the strength of the brass , till her arms fell soft on his</l>
       <l n="312">shoulder .</l>
       <l n="313">Once she essayed to escape : but the ring of the water was round her ,</l>
       <l n="314">Round her the ring of his arms ; and despairing she sank on his bosom .</l>
       <l n="315">Then , like a fawn when startled , she looked with a shriek to the seaward .</l>
       <l n="316">‘ Touch me not , wretch that I am ! For accursed , a shame and a hissing ,</l>
       <l n="317">Guiltless , accurst no less , I await the revenge of the sea-gods .</l>
       <l n="318">Yonder it comes ! Ah go ! Let me perish unseen , if I perish !</l>
       <l n="319">Spare me the shame of thine eyes , when merciless fangs must tear me</l>
       <l n="320">Piecemeal ! Enough to endure by myself in the light of the sunshine</l>
       <l n="321">Guiltless , the death of a kid ! ’</l>
       <l n="322">But the boy still lingered around her ,</l>
       <l n="323">Loth , like a boy , to forego her , and waken the cliffs with his laughter .</l>
       <l n="324">‘ Yon is the foe , then ? A beast of the sea ? I had deemed him immortal .</l>
       <l n="325">Titan , or Proteus ’ self , or Nereus , foeman of sailors :</l>
       <l n="326">Yet would I fight with them all , but Poseidon , shaker of mountains ,</l>
       <l n="327">Uncle of mine , whom I fear , as is fit ; for he haunts on Olympus ,</l>
       <l n="328">Holding the third of the world ; and the gods all rise at his coming .</l>
       <l n="329">Unto none else will I yield , god-helped : how then to a monster ,</l>
       <l n="330">Child of the earth and of night , unreasoning , shapeless , accursed ? ’</l>
       <l n="331">‘ Art thou , too , then a god ? ’</l>
       <l n="332">‘ No god I , ’ smiling he answered ;</l>
       <l n="333">‘ Mortal as thou , yet divine : but mortal the herds of the ocean ,</l>
       <l n="334">Equal to men in that only , and less in all else ; for they nourish</l>
       <l n="335">Blindly the life of the lips , untaught by the gods , without wisdom :</l>
       <l n="336">Shame if I fled before such ! ’</l>
       <l n="337">In her heart new life was enkindled ,</l>
       <l n="338">Worship and trust , fair parents of love : but she answered him sighing .</l>
       <l n="339">‘ Beautiful , why wilt thou die ? Is the light of the sun , then , so</l>
       <l n="340">worthless ,</l>
       <l n="341">Worthless to sport with thy fellows in flowery glades of the forest ,</l>
       <l n="342">Under the broad green oaks , where never again shall I wander ,</l>
       <l n="343">Tossing the ball with my maidens , or wreathing the altar in garlands ,</l>
       <l n="344">Careless , with dances and songs , till the glens rang loud to our laughter .</l>
       <l n="345">Too full of death the sad earth is already : the halls full of weepers ,</l>
       <l n="346">Quarried by tombs all cliffs , and the bones gleam white on the sea-floor ,</l>
       <l n="347">Numberless , gnawn by the herds who attend on the pitiless sea-gods ,</l>
       <l n="348">Even as mine will be soon : and yet noble it seems to me , dying ,</l>
       <l n="349">Giving my life for a people , to save to the arms of their lovers</l>
       <l n="350">Maidens and youths for a while : thee , fairest of all , shall I slay thee ?</l>
       <l n="351">Add not thy bones to the many , thus angering idly the dread ones !</l>
       <l n="352">Either the monster will crush , or the sea-queen 's self overwhelm thee ,</l>
       <l n="353">Vengeful , in tempest and foam , and the thundering walls of the surges .</l>
       <l n="354">Why wilt thou follow me down ? can we love in the black blank darkness ?</l>
       <l n="355">Love in the realms of the dead , in the land where all is forgotten ?</l>
       <l n="356">Why wilt thou follow me down ? is it joy , on the desolate oozes ,</l>
       <l n="357">Meagre to flit , gray ghosts in the depths of the gray salt water ?</l>
       <l n="358">Beautiful ! why wilt thou die , and defraud fair girls of thy manhood ?</l>
       <l n="359">Surely one waits for thee longing , afar in the isles of the ocean .</l>
       <l n="360">Go thy way ; I mine ; for the gods grudge pleasure to mortals . ’</l>
       <l n="361">Sobbing she ended her moan , as her neck , like a storm-bent lily ,</l>
       <l n="362">Drooped with the weight of her woe , and her limbs sank , weary with watching ,</l>
       <l n="363">Soft on the hard-ledged rock : but the boy , with his eye on the monster ,</l>
       <l n="364">Clasped her , and stood , like a god ; and his lips curved proud as he answered —</l>
       <l n="365">‘ Great are the pitiless sea-gods : but greater the Lords of Olympus ;</l>
       <l n="366">Greater the AEgis-wielder , and greater is she who attends him .</l>
       <l n="367">Clear-eyed Justice her name is , the counsellor , loved of Athene ;</l>
       <l n="368">Helper of heroes , who dare , in the god-given might of their manhood ,</l>
       <l n="369">Greatly to do and to suffer , and far in the fens ’ and the forests</l>
       <l n="370">Smite the devourers of men , Heaven-hated , brood of the giants ,</l>
       <l n="371">Twyformed , strange , without like , who obey not the golden-haired Rulers .</l>
       <l n="372">Vainly rebelling they rage , till they die by the swords of the heroes ,</l>
       <l n="373">Even as this must die ; for I burn with the wrath of my father ,</l>
       <l n="374">Wandering , led by Athene ; and dare whatsoever betides me .</l>
       <l n="375">Led by Athene I won from the gray-haired terrible sisters</l>
       <l n="376">Secrets hidden from men , when I found them asleep on the sand-hills ,</l>
       <l n="377">Keeping their eye and their tooth , till they showed me the perilous pathway</l>
       <l n="378">Over the waterless ocean , the valley that led to the Gorgon .</l>
       <l n="379">Her too I slew in my craft , Medusa , the beautiful horror ;</l>
       <l n="380">Taught by Athene I slew her , and saw not herself , but her image ,</l>
       <l n="381">Watching the mirror of brass , in the shield which a goddess had lent me .</l>
       <l n="382">Cleaving her brass-scaled throat , as she lay with her adders around her ,</l>
       <l n="383">Fearless I bore off her head , in the folds of the mystical goat-skin</l>
       <l n="384">Hide of Amaltheie , fair nurse of the AEgis-wielder .</l>
       <l n="385">Hither I bear it , a gift to the gods , and a death to my foe-men ,</l>
       <l n="386">Freezing the seer to stone ; to hide thine eyes from the horror .</l>
       <l n="387">Kiss me but once , and I go . ’</l>
       <l n="388">Then lifting her neck , like a sea-bird</l>
       <l n="389">Peering up over the wave , from the foam-white swells of her bosom ,</l>
       <l n="390">Blushing she kissed him : afar , on the topmost Idalian summit</l>
       <l n="391">Laughed in the joy of her heart , far-seeing , the queen Aphrodite .</l>
       <l n="392">Loosing his arms from her waist he flew upward , awaiting the sea-beast .</l>
       <l n="393">Onward it came from the southward , as bulky and black as a galley ,</l>
       <l n="394">Lazily coasting along , as the fish fled leaping before it ;</l>
       <l n="395">Lazily breasting the ripple , and watching by sandbar and headland ,</l>
       <l n="396">Listening for laughter of maidens at bleaching , or song of the fisher ,</l>
       <l n="397">Children at play on the pebbles , or cattle that pawed on the sand-hills .</l>
       <l n="398">Rolling and dripping it came , where bedded in glistening purple</l>
       <l n="399">Cold on the cold sea-weeds lay the long white sides of the maiden ,</l>
       <l n="400">Trembling , her face in her hands , and her tresses afloat on the water .</l>
       <l n="401">As when an osprey aloft , dark-eyebrowed , royally crested ,</l>
       <l n="402">Flags on by creek and by cove , and in scorn of the anger of Nereus</l>
       <l n="403">Ranges , the king of the shore ; if he see on a glittering shallow ,</l>
       <l n="404">Chasing the bass and the mullet , the fin of a wallowing dolphin ,</l>
       <l n="405">Halting , he wheels round slowly , in doubt at the weight of his quarry ,</l>
       <l n="406">Whether to clutch it alive , or to fall on the wretch like a plummet ,</l>
       <l n="407">Stunning with terrible talon the life of the brain in the hindhead :</l>
       <l n="408">Then rushes up with a scream , and stooping the wrath of his eyebrows</l>
       <l n="409">Falls from the sky , like a star , while the wind rattles hoarse in his</l>
       <l n="410">pinions .</l>
       <l n="411">Over him closes the foam for a moment ; and then from the sand-bed</l>
       <l n="412">Rolls up the great fish , dead , and his side gleams white in the sunshine .</l>
       <l n="413">Thus fell the boy on the beast , unveiling the face of the Gorgon ;</l>
       <l n="414">Thus fell the boy on the beast ; thus rolled up the beast in his horror ,</l>
       <l n="415">Once , as the dead eyes glared into his ; then his sides , death-sharpened ,</l>
       <l n="416">Stiffened and stood , brown rock , in the wash of the wandering water .</l>
       <l n="417">Beautiful , eager , triumphant , he leapt back again to his treasure ;</l>
       <l n="418">Leapt back again , full blest , toward arms spread wide to receive him .</l>
       <l n="419">Brimful of honour he clasped her , and brimful of love she caressed him ,</l>
       <l n="420">Answering lip with lip ; while above them the queen Aphrodite</l>
       <l n="421">Poured on their foreheads and limbs , unseen , ambrosial odours ,</l>
       <l n="422">Givers of longing , and rapture , and chaste content in espousals .</l>
       <l n="423">Happy whom ere they be wedded anoints she , the Queen Aphrodite !</l>
       <l n="424">Laughing she called to her sister , the chaste Tritonid Athene ,</l>
       <l n="425">‘ Seest thou yonder thy pupil , thou maid of the AEgis-wielder ?</l>
       <l n="426">How he has turned himself wholly to love , and caresses a damsel ,</l>
       <l n="427">Dreaming no longer of honour , or danger , or Pallas Athene ?</l>
       <l n="428">Sweeter , it seems , to the young my gifts are ; so yield me the stripling ;</l>
       <l n="429">Yield him me now , lest he die in his prime , like hapless Adonis . ’</l>
       <l n="430">Smiling she answered in turn , that chaste Tritonid Athene :</l>
       <l n="431">‘ Dear unto me , no less than to thee , is the wedlock of heroes ;</l>
       <l n="432">Dear , who can worthily win him a wife not unworthy ; and noble ,</l>
       <l n="433">Pure with the pure to beget brave children , the like of their father .</l>
       <l n="434">Happy , who thus stands linked to the heroes who were , and who shall be ;</l>
       <l n="435">Girdled with holiest awe , not sparing of self ; for his mother</l>
       <l n="436">Watches his steps with the eyes of the gods ; and his wife and his children</l>
       <l n="437">Move him to plan and to do in the farm and the camp and the council .</l>
       <l n="438">Thence comes weal to a nation : but woe upon woe , when the people</l>
       <l n="439">Mingle in love at their will , like the brutes , not heeding the future . ’</l>
       <l n="440">Then from her gold-strung loom , where she wrought in her chamber of cedar ,</l>
       <l n="441">Awful and fair she arose ; and she went by the glens of Olympus ;</l>
       <l n="442">Went by the isles of the sea , and the wind never ruffled her mantle ;</l>
       <l n="443">Went by the water of Crete , and the black-beaked fleets of the Phoenics ;</l>
       <l n="444">Came to the sea-girt rock which is washed by the surges for ever ,</l>
       <l n="445">Bearing the wealth of the gods , for a gift to the bride of a hero .</l>
       <l n="446">There she met Andromeden and Persea , shaped like Immortals ;</l>
       <l n="447">Solemn and sweet was her smile , while their hearts beat loud at her coming ;</l>
       <l n="448">Solemn and sweet was her smile , as she spoke to the pair in her wisdom .</l>
       <l n="449">‘ Three things hold we , the Rulers , who sit by the founts of Olympus ,</l>
       <l n="450">Wisdom , and prowess , and beauty ; and freely we pour them on mortals ;</l>
       <l n="451">Pleased at our image in man , as a father at his in his children .</l>
       <l n="452">One thing only we grudge to mankind : when a hero , unthankful ,</l>
       <l n="453">Boasts of our gifts as his own , stiffnecked , and dishonours the givers ,</l>
       <l n="454">Turning our weapons against us . Him Ate follows avenging ;</l>
       <l n="455">Slowly she tracks him and sure , as a lyme-hound ; sudden she grips him ,</l>
       <l n="456">Crushing him , blind in his pride , for a sign and a terror to folly .</l>
       <l n="457">This we avenge , as is fit ; in all else never weary of giving .</l>
       <l n="458">Come , then , damsel , and know if the gods grudge pleasure to mortals . ’</l>
       <l n="459">Loving and gentle she spoke : but the maid stood in awe , as the goddess</l>
       <l n="460">Plaited with soft swift finger her tresses , and decked her in jewels ,</l>
       <l n="461">Armlet and anklet and earbell ; and over her shoulders a necklace ,</l>
       <l n="462">Heavy , enamelled , the flower of the gold and the brass of the mountain .</l>
       <l n="463">Trembling with joy she gazed , so well Haephaistos had made it ,</l>
       <l n="464">Deep in the forges of AEtna , while Charis his lady beside him</l>
       <l n="465">Mingled her grace in his craft , as he wrought for his sister Athene .</l>
       <l n="466">Then on the brows of the maiden a veil bound Pallas Athene ;</l>
       <l n="467">Ample it fell to her feet , deep-fringed , a wonder of weaving .</l>
       <l n="468">Ages and ages agone it was wrought on the heights of Olympus ,</l>
       <l n="469">Wrought in the gold-strung loom , by the finger of cunning Athene .</l>
       <l n="470">In it she wove all creatures that teem in the womb of the ocean ;</l>
       <l n="471">Nereid , siren , and triton , and dolphin , and arrowy fishes</l>
       <l n="472">Glittering round , many-hued , on the flame-red folds of the mantle .</l>
       <l n="473">In it she wove , too , a town where gray-haired kings sat in judgment ;</l>
       <l n="474">Sceptre in hand in the market they sat , doing right by the people ,</l>
       <l n="475">Wise : while above watched Justice , and near , far-seeing Apollo .</l>
       <l n="476">Round it she wove for a fringe all herbs of the earth and the water ,</l>
       <l n="477">Violet , asphodel , ivy , and vine-leaves , roses and lilies ,</l>
       <l n="478">Coral and sea-fan and tangle , the blooms and the palms of the ocean :</l>
       <l n="479">Now from Olympus she bore it , a dower to the bride of a hero .</l>
       <l n="480">Over the limbs of the damsel she wrapt it : the maid still trembled ,</l>
       <l n="481">Shading her face with her hands ; for the eyes of the goddess were awful .</l>
       <l n="482">Then , as a pine upon Ida when southwest winds blow landward ,</l>
       <l n="483">Stately she bent to the damsel , and breathed on her : under her breathing</l>
       <l n="484">Taller and fairer she grew ; and the goddess spoke in her wisdom .</l>
       <l n="485">‘ Courage I give thee ; the heart of a queen , and the mind of Immortals ;</l>
       <l n="486">Godlike to talk with the gods , and to look on their eyes unshrinking ;</l>
       <l n="487">Fearing the sun and the stars no more , and the blue salt water ;</l>
       <l n="488">Fearing us only , the lords of Olympus , friends of the heroes ;</l>
       <l n="489">Chastely and wisely to govern thyself and thy house and thy people ,</l>
       <l n="490">Bearing a godlike race to thy spouse , till dying I set thee</l>
       <l n="491">High for a star in the heavens , a sign and a hope to the seamen ,</l>
       <l n="492">Spreading thy long white arms all night in the heights of the aether ,</l>
       <l n="493">Hard by thy sire and the hero thy spouse , while near thee thy mother</l>
       <l n="494">Sits in her ivory chair , as she plaits ambrosial tresses .</l>
       <l n="495">All night long thou wilt shine ; all day thou wilt feast on Olympus ,</l>
       <l n="496">Happy , the guest of the gods , by thy husband , the god-begotten . ’</l>
       <l n="497">Blissful , they turned them to go : but the fair-tressed Pallas Athene</l>
       <l n="498">Rose , like a pillar of tall white cloud , toward silver Olympus ;</l>
       <l n="499">Far above ocean and shore , and the peaks of the isles and the mainland ;</l>
       <l n="500">Where no frost nor storm is , in clear blue windless abysses ,</l>
       <l n="501">High in the home of the summer , the seats of the happy Immortals ,</l>
       <l n="502">Shrouded in keen deep blaze , unapproachable ; there ever youthful</l>
       <l n="503">Hebe , Harmonie , and the daughter of Jove , Aphrodite ,</l>
       <l n="504">Whirled in the white-linked dance with the gold-crowned Hours and the Graces ,</l>
       <l n="505">Hand within hand , while clear piped Phoebe , queen of the woodlands .</l>
       <l n="506">All day long they rejoiced : but Athene still in her chamber</l>
       <l n="507">Bent herself over her loom , as the stars rang loud to her singing ,</l>
       <l n="508">Chanting of order and right , and of foresight , warden of nations ;</l>
       <l n="509">Chanting of labour and craft , and of wealth in the port and the garner ;</l>
       <l n="510">Chanting of valour and fame , and the man who can fall with the foremost ,</l>
       <l n="511">Fighting for children and wife , and the field which his father bequeathed</l>
       <l n="512">him .</l>
       <l n="513">Sweetly and solemnly sang she , and planned new lessons for mortals :</l>
       <l n="514">Happy , who hearing obey her , the wise unsullied Athene .</l>

       <l n="1">And should she die , her grave should be</l>
       <l n="2">Upon the bare top of a sunny hill ,</l>
       <l n="3">Among the moorlands of her own fair land ,</l>
       <l n="4">Amid a ring of old and moss-grown stones</l>
       <l n="5">In gorse and heather all embosomed .</l>
       <l n="6">There should be no tall stone , no marble tomb</l>
       <l n="7">Above her gentle corse ;— the ponderous pile</l>
       <l n="8">Would press too rudely on those fairy limbs .</l>
       <l n="9">The turf should lightly he , that marked her home .</l>
       <l n="10">A sacred spot it would be — every bird</l>
       <l n="11">That came to watch her lone grave should be holy .</l>
       <l n="12">The deer should browse around her undisturbed ;</l>
       <l n="13">The whin bird by , her lonely nest should build</l>
       <l n="14">All fearless ; for in life she loved to see</l>
       <l n="15">Happiness in all things —</l>
       <l n="16">And we would come on summer days</l>
       <l n="17">When all around was bright , and set us down</l>
       <l n="18">And think of all that lay beneath that turf</l>
       <l n="19">On which the heedless moor-bird sits , and whistles</l>
       <l n="20">His long , shrill , painful song , as though he plained</l>
       <l n="21">For her that loved him and his pleasant hills ;</l>
       <l n="22">And we would dream again of bygone days</l>
       <l n="23">Until our eyes should swell with natural tears</l>
       <l n="24">For brilliant hopes — all faded into air !</l>
       <l n="25">As , on the sands of Irak , near approach</l>
       <l n="26">Destroys the traveller 's vision of still lakes ,</l>
       <l n="27">And goodly streams reed-clad , and meadows green ;</l>
       <l n="28">And leaves behind the drear reality</l>
       <l n="29">Of shadeless , same , yet ever-changing sand !</l>
       <l n="30">And when the sullen clouds rose thick on high</l>
       <l n="31">Mountains on mountains rolling — and dark mist</l>
       <l n="32">Wrapped itself round the hill-tops like a shroud ,</l>
       <l n="33">When on her grave swept by the moaning wind</l>
       <l n="34">Bending the heather-bells — then would I come</l>
       <l n="35">And watch by her , in silent loneliness ,</l>
       <l n="36">And smile upon the storm — as knowing well</l>
       <l n="37">The lightning 's flash would surely turn aside ,</l>
       <l n="38">Nor mar the lowly mound , where peaceful sleeps</l>
       <l n="39">All that gave life and love to one fond heart !</l>
       <l n="40">I talk of things that are not ; and if prayers</l>
       <l n="41">By night and day availed from my weak lips ,</l>
       <l n="42">Then should they never be ! till I was gone ,</l>
       <l n="43">Before the friends I loved , to my long home .</l>
       <l n="44">Oh pardon me , if e'er I say too much ; my mind</l>
       <l n="45">Too often strangely turns to ribald mirth ,</l>
       <l n="46">As though I had no doubt nor hope beyond —</l>
       <l n="47">Or brooding melancholy cloys my soul</l>
       <l n="48">With thoughts of days misspent , of wasted time</l>
       <l n="49">And bitter feelings swallowed up in jests .</l>
       <l n="50">Then strange and fearful thoughts flit o'er my brain</l>
       <l n="51">By indistinctness made more terrible ,</l>
       <l n="52">And incubi mock at me with fierce eyes</l>
       <l n="53">Upon my couch : and visions , crude and dire ,</l>
       <l n="54">Of planets , suns , millions of miles , infinity ,</l>
       <l n="55">Space , time , thought , being , blank nonentity ,</l>
       <l n="56">Things incorporeal , fancies of the brain ,</l>
       <l n="57">Seen , heard , as though they were material ,</l>
       <l n="58">All mixed in sickening mazes , trouble me ,</l>
       <l n="59">And lead my soul away from earth and heaven</l>
       <l n="60">Until I doubt whether I be or not !</l>
       <l n="61">And then I see all frightful shapes — lank ghosts ,</l>
       <l n="62">Hydras , chimeras , krakens , wastes of sand ,</l>
       <l n="63">Herbless and void of living voice — tall mountains</l>
       <l n="64">Cleaving the skies with height immeasurable ,</l>
       <l n="65">On which perchance I climb for infinite years ; broad seas ,</l>
       <l n="66">Studded with islands numberless , that stretch</l>
       <l n="67">Beyond the regions of the sun , and fade</l>
       <l n="68">Away in distance vast , or dreary clouds ,</l>
       <l n="69">Cold , dark , and watery , where wander I for ever !</l>
       <l n="70">Or space of ether , where I hang for aye !</l>
       <l n="71">A speck , an atom — inconsumable —</l>
       <l n="72">Immortal , hopeless , voiceless , powerless !</l>
       <l n="73">And oft I fancy , I am weak and old ,</l>
       <l n="74">And all who loved me , one by one , are dead ,</l>
       <l n="75">And I am left alone — and cannot die !</l>
       <l n="76">Surely there is no rest on earth for souls</l>
       <l n="77">Whose dreams are like a madman 's ! I am young</l>
       <l n="78">And much is yet before me — after years</l>
       <l n="79">May bring peace with them to my weary heart !</l>

       <l n="1">The baby sings not on its mother 's breast ;</l>
       <l n="2">Nor nightingales who nestle side by side ;</l>
       <l n="3">Nor I by thine : but let us only part ,</l>
       <l n="4">Then lips which should but kiss , and so be still ,</l>
       <l n="5">As having uttered all , must speak again —</l>
       <l n="6">O stunted thoughts ! O chill and fettered rhyme</l>
       <l n="7">Yet my great bliss , though still entirely blest ,</l>
       <l n="8">Losing its proper home , can find no rest :</l>
       <l n="9">So , like a child who whiles away the time</l>
       <l n="10">With dance and carol till the eventide ,</l>
       <l n="11">Watching its mother homeward through the glen ;</l>
       <l n="12">Or nightingale , who , sitting far apart ,</l>
       <l n="13">Tells to his listening mate within the nest</l>
       <l n="14">The wonder of his star-entranced heart</l>
       <l n="15">Till all the wakened woodlands laugh and thrill —</l>
       <l n="16">Forth all my being bubbles into song ;</l>
       <l n="17">And rings aloft , not smooth , yet clear and strong .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">I heard an Eagle crying all alone</l>
       <l n="2">Above the vineyards through the summer night ,</l>
       <l n="3">Among the skeletons of robber towers :</l>
       <l n="4">Because the ancient eyrie of his race</l>
       <l n="5">Was trenched and walled by busy-handed men ;</l>
       <l n="6">And all his forest-chace and woodland wild ,</l>
       <l n="7">Wherefrom he fed his young with hare and roe ,</l>
       <l n="8">Were trim with grapes which swelled from hour to hour ,</l>
       <l n="9">And tossed their golden tendrils to the sun</l>
       <l n="10">For joy at their own riches :— So , I thought ,</l>
       <l n="11">The great devourers of the earth shall sit ,</l>
       <l n="12">Idle and impotent , they know not why ,</l>
       <l n="13">Down-staring from their barren height of state</l>
       <l n="14">On nations grown too wise to slay and slave ,</l>
       <l n="15">The puppets of the few ; while peaceful lore</l>
       <l n="16">And fellow-help make glad the heart of earth ,</l>
       <l n="17">With wonders which they fear and hate , as he ,</l>
       <l n="18">The Eagle , hates the vineyard slopes below .</l>

       <l n="1">Thank God ! Those gazers ’ eyes are gone at last !</l>

       <l n="38">And I could save you ! You would hear your love —</l>
       <l n="39">They knew you loved me , cruel men ! And then —</l>
       <l n="40">Then came a dream ; to say one little word ,</l>
       <l n="41">One easy wicked word , we both might say ,</l>
       <l n="42">And no one hear us , but the lictors round ;</l>
       <l n="43">One tiny sprinkle of the incense grains ,</l>
       <l n="44">And both , both free ! And life had just begun —</l>
       <l n="45">Only three months — short months — your wedded wife</l>
       <l n="46">Only three months within the cottage there —</l>
       <l n="47">Hoping I bore your child . . . .</l>
       <l n="48">Ah ! husband ! Saviour ! God ! think gently of me !</l>
       <l n="49">I am forgiven ! . . .</l>
       <l n="50">And then another dream ;</l>
       <l n="51">A flash — so quick , I could not bear the blaze ;</l>
       <l n="52">I could not see the smoke among the light —</l>
       <l n="53">To wander out through unknown lands , and lead</l>
       <l n="54">You by the hand through hamlet , port , and town ,</l>
       <l n="55">On , on , until we died ; and stand each day</l>
       <l n="56">To glory in you , as you preached and prayed</l>
       <l n="57">From rock and bourne-stone , with that voice , those words ,</l>
       <l n="58">Mingled with fire and honey — you would wake ,</l>
       <l n="59">Bend , save whole nations ! would not that atone</l>
       <l n="60">For one short word ?— ay , make it right , to save</l>
       <l n="61">You , you , to fight the battles of the Lord ?</l>
       <l n="62">And so — and so — alas ! you knew the rest !</l>
       <l n="63">You answered me . . . .</l>
       <l n="64">Ah cruel words ! No ! Blessed , godlike words .</l>
       <l n="65">You had done nobly had you struck me dead ,</l>
       <l n="66">Instead of striking me to life !— the temptress ! . . .</l>
       <l n="67">‘ Traitress ! apostate ! dead to God and me ! ’ —</l>
       <l n="68">‘ The smell of death upon me ? ’ — so it was !</l>
       <l n="69">True ! true ! well spoken , hero ! Oh they snapped ,</l>
       <l n="70">Those words , my madness , like the angel 's voice</l>
       <l n="71">Thrilling the graves to birth-pangs . All was clear .</l>
       <l n="72">There was but one right thing in the world to do ;</l>
       <l n="73">And I must do it . . . . Lord , have mercy ! Christ !</l>
       <l n="74">Help through my womanhood : or I shall fail</l>
       <l n="75">Yet , as I failed before ! . . . I could not speak —</l>
       <l n="76">I could not speak for shame and misery ,</l>
       <l n="77">And terror of my sin , and of the things</l>
       <l n="78">I knew were coming : but in heaven , in heaven !</l>
       <l n="79">There we should meet , perhaps — and by that time</l>
       <l n="80">I might be worthy of you once again —</l>
       <l n="81">Of you , and of my God . . . . So I went out .</l>
       <l n="82">. . . . . .</l>
       <l n="83">Will you hear more , and so forget the pain ?</l>
       <l n="84">And yet I dread to tell you what comes next ;</l>
       <l n="85">Your love will feel it all again for me .</l>
       <l n="86">No ! it is over ; and the woe that 's dead</l>
       <l n="87">Rises next hour a glorious angel . Love !</l>
       <l n="88">Say , shall I tell you ? Ah ! your lips are dry !</l>
       <l n="89">To-morrow , when they come , we must entreat ,</l>
       <l n="90">And they will give you water . One to-day ,</l>
       <l n="91">A soldier , gave me water in a sponge</l>
       <l n="92">Upon a reed , and said , ‘ Too fair ! too young !</l>
       <l n="93">She might have been a gallant soldier 's wife ! ’</l>
       <l n="94">And then I cried , ‘ I am a soldier 's wife !</l>
       <l n="95">A hero 's ! ’ And he smiled , but let me drink .</l>
       <l n="96">God bless him for it !</l>
       <l n="97">So they led me back :</l>
       <l n="98">And as I went , a voice was in my ears</l>
       <l n="99">Which rang through all the sunlight , and the breath</l>
       <l n="100">And blaze of all the garden slopes below ,</l>
       <l n="101">And through the harvest-voices , and the moan</l>
       <l n="102">Of cedar-forests on the cliffs above ,</l>
       <l n="103">And round the shining rivers , and the peaks</l>
       <l n="104">Which hung beyond the cloud-bed of the west ,</l>
       <l n="105">And round the ancient stones about my feet .</l>
       <l n="106">Out of all heaven and earth it rang , and cried ,</l>
       <l n="107">‘ My hand hath made all these . Am I too weak</l>
       <l n="108">To give thee strength to say so ? ’ Then my soul</l>
       <l n="109">Spread like a clear blue sky within my breast ,</l>
       <l n="110">While all the people made a ring around ,</l>
       <l n="111">And in the midst the judge spoke smilingly —</l>
       <l n="112">‘ Well ! hast thou brought him to a better mind ? ’</l>
       <l n="113">‘ No ! He has brought me to a better mind ! ’ —</l>
       <l n="114">I cried , and said beside — I know not what —</l>
       <l n="115">Words which I learnt from thee — I trust in God</l>
       <l n="116">Nought fierce or rude — for was I not a girl</l>
       <l n="117">Three months ago beneath my mother 's roof ?</l>
       <l n="118">I thought of that . She might be there ! I looked —</l>
       <l n="119">She was not there ! I hid my face and wept .</l>
       <l n="120">And when I looked again , the judge 's eye</l>
       <l n="121">Was on me , cold and steady , deep in thought —</l>
       <l n="122">‘ She knows what shame is still ; so strip her . ’ ‘ Ah ! ’</l>
       <l n="123">I shrieked , ‘ Not that , Sir ! Any pain ! So young</l>
       <l n="124">I am — a wife too — I am not my own ,</l>
       <l n="125">But his — my husband 's ! ’ But they took my shawl ,</l>
       <l n="126">And tore my tunic off , and there I stood</l>
       <l n="127">Before them all . . . . Husband ! you love me still ?</l>
       <l n="128">Indeed I pleaded ! Oh , shine out , kind moon ,</l>
       <l n="129">And let me see him smile ! Oh ! how I prayed ,</l>
       <l n="130">While some cried ‘ Shame ! ’ and some , ‘ She is too young ! ’</l>
       <l n="131">And some mocked — ugly words : God shut my ears .</l>
       <l n="132">And yet no earthquake came to swallow me .</l>
       <l n="133">While all the court around , and walls , and roofs ,</l>
       <l n="134">And all the earth and air were full of eyes ,</l>
       <l n="135">Eyes , eyes , which scorched my limbs like burning flame ,</l>
       <l n="136">Until my brain seemed bursting from my brow :</l>
       <l n="137">And yet no earthquake came ! And then I knew</l>
       <l n="138">This body was not yours alone , but God 's —</l>
       <l n="139">His loan — He needed it : and after that</l>
       <l n="140">The worst was come , and any torture more</l>
       <l n="141">A change — a lightening ; and I did not shriek —</l>
       <l n="142">Once only — once , when first I felt the whip —</l>
       <l n="143">It coiled so keen around my side , and sent</l>
       <l n="144">A fire-flash through my heart which choked me — then</l>
       <l n="145">I shrieked — that once . The foolish echo rang</l>
       <l n="146">So far and long — I prayed you might not hear .</l>
       <l n="147">And then a mist , which hid the ring of eyes ,</l>
       <l n="148">Swam by me , and a murmur in my ears</l>
       <l n="149">Of humming bees around the limes at home ;</l>
       <l n="150">And I was all alone with you and God .</l>
       <l n="151">And what they did to me I hardly know ;</l>
       <l n="152">I felt , and did not feel . Now I look back ,</l>
       <l n="153">It was not after all so very sharp :</l>
       <l n="154">So do not pity me . It made me pray ;</l>
       <l n="155">Forget my shame in pain , and pain in you ,</l>
       <l n="156">And you in God : and once , when I looked down ,</l>
       <l n="157">And saw an ugly sight — so many wounds !</l>
       <l n="158">‘ What matter ? ’ thought I . ‘ His dear eyes are dark ;</l>
       <l n="159">For them alone I kept these limbs so white —</l>
       <l n="160">A foolish pride ! As God wills now . ‘ Tis just . ’</l>
       <l n="161">But then the judge spoke out in haste : ‘ She is mad ,</l>
       <l n="162">Or fenced by magic arts ! She feels no pain ! ’</l>
       <l n="163">He did not know I was on fire within :</l>
       <l n="164">Better he should not ; so his sin was less .</l>
       <l n="165">Then he cried fiercely , ‘ Take the slave away ,</l>
       <l n="166">And crucify her by her husband 's side ! ’</l>
       <l n="167">And at those words a film came on my face —</l>
       <l n="168">A sickening rush of joy — was that the end ?</l>
       <l n="169">That my reward ? I rose , and tried to go —</l>
       <l n="170">But all the eyes had vanished , and the judge ;</l>
       <l n="171">And all the buildings melted into mist :</l>
       <l n="172">So how they brought me here I cannot tell —</l>
       <l n="173">Here , here , by you , until the judgment-day ,</l>
       <l n="174">And after that for ever and for ever !</l>
       <l n="175">Ah ! If I could but reach that hand ! One touch !</l>
       <l n="176">One finger tip , to send the thrill through me</l>
       <l n="177">I felt but yesterday !— No ! I can wait :—</l>
       <l n="178">Another body !— Oh , new limbs are ready ,</l>
       <l n="179">Free , pure , instinct with soul through every nerve ,</l>
       <l n="180">Kept for us in the treasuries of God .</l>
       <l n="181">They will not mar the love they try to speak ,</l>
       <l n="182">They will not fail my soul , as these have done !</l>
       <l n="183">. . . . .</l>
       <l n="184">Will you hear more ? Nay — you know all the rest :</l>
       <l n="185">Yet those poor eyes — alas ! they could not see</l>
       <l n="186">My waking , when you hung above me there</l>
       <l n="187">With hands outstretched to bless the penitent —</l>
       <l n="188">Your penitent — even like The Lord Himself —</l>
       <l n="189">I gloried in you !— like The Lord Himself !</l>
       <l n="190">Sharing His very sufferings , to the crown</l>
       <l n="191">Of thorns which they had put on that dear brow</l>
       <l n="192">To make you like Him — show you as you were !</l>
       <l n="193">I told them so ! I bid them look on you ,</l>
       <l n="194">And see there what was the highest throne on earth —</l>
       <l n="195">The throne of suffering , where the Son of God</l>
       <l n="196">Endured and triumphed for them . But they laughed ;</l>
       <l n="197">All but one soldier , gray , with many scars ;</l>
       <l n="198">And he stood silent . Then I crawled to you ,</l>
       <l n="199">And kissed your bleeding feet , and called aloud —</l>
       <l n="200">You heard me ! You know all ! I am at peace .</l>
       <l n="201">Peace , peace , as still and bright as is the moon</l>
       <l n="202">Upon your limbs , came on me at your smile ,</l>
       <l n="203">And kept me happy , when they dragged me back</l>
       <l n="204">From that last kiss , and spread me on the cross ,</l>
       <l n="205">And bound my wrists and ankles — Do not sigh :</l>
       <l n="206">I prayed , and bore it : and since they raised me up</l>
       <l n="207">My eyes have never left your face , my own , my own ,</l>
       <l n="208">Nor will , till death comes ! . . .</l>
       <l n="209">Do I feel much pain ?</l>
       <l n="210">Not much . Not maddening . None I cannot bear .</l>
       <l n="211">It has become like part of my own life ,</l>
       <l n="212">Or part of God 's life in me — honour — bliss !</l>
       <l n="213">I dreaded madness , and instead comes rest ;</l>
       <l n="214">Rest deep and smiling , like a summer 's night .</l>
       <l n="215">I should be easy , now , if I could move . . .</l>
       <l n="216">I cannot stir . Ah God ! these shoots of fire</l>
       <l n="217">Through all my limbs ! Hush , selfish girl ! He hears you !</l>
       <l n="218">Who ever found the cross a pleasant bed ?</l>
       <l n="219">Yes ; I can bear it , love . Pain is no evil</l>
       <l n="220">Unless it conquers us . These little wrists , now —</l>
       <l n="221">You said , one blessed night , they were too slender ,</l>
       <l n="222">Too soft and slender for a deacon 's wife —</l>
       <l n="223">Perhaps a martyr 's :— You forgot the strength</l>
       <l n="224">Which God can give . The cord has cut them through ;</l>
       <l n="225">And yet my voice has never faltered yet .</l>
       <l n="226">Oh ! do not groan , or I shall long and pray</l>
       <l n="227">That you may die : and you must not die yet .</l>
       <l n="228">Not yet — they told us we might live three days . . .</l>
       <l n="229">Two days for you to preach ! Two days to speak</l>
       <l n="230">Words which may wake the dead !</l>
       <l n="231">. . . . .</l>
       <l n="232">Hush ! is he sleeping ?</l>
       <l n="233">They say that men have slept upon the cross ;</l>
       <l n="234">So why not he ? . . . Thanks , Lord ! I hear him breathe :</l>
       <l n="235">And he will preach Thy word to-morrow !— save</l>
       <l n="236">Souls , crowds , for Thee ! And they will know his worth</l>
       <l n="237">Years hence — poor things , they know not what they do !—</l>
       <l n="238">And crown him martyr ; and his name will ring</l>
       <l n="239">Through all the shores of earth , and all the stars</l>
       <l n="240">Whose eyes are sparkling through their tears to see</l>
       <l n="241">His triumph — Preacher ! Martyr !— Ah — and me ?—</l>
       <l n="242">If they must couple my poor name with his ,</l>
       <l n="243">Let them tell all the truth — say how I loved him ,</l>
       <l n="244">And tried to damn him by that love ! O Lord !</l>
       <l n="245">Returning good for evil ! and was this</l>
       <l n="246">The payment I deserved for such a sin ?</l>
       <l n="247">To hang here on my cross , and look at him</l>
       <l n="248">Until we kneel before Thy throne in heaven !</l>

       <l n="15">And the negro maids to Aves from bondage fast did flee ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">How will it dawn , the coming Christmas Day ?</l>
       <l n="2">A northern Christmas , such as painters love ,</l>
       <l n="3">And kinsfolk , shaking hands but once a year ,</l>
       <l n="4">And dames who tell old legends by the fire ?</l>

       <l n="6">Keen ringing air , which sets the blood on fire ,</l>
       <l n="7">And makes the old man merry with the young ,</l>
       <l n="8">Through the short sunshine , through the longer night ?</l>
       <l n="9">Or southern Christmas , dark and dank with mist ,</l>
       <l n="10">And heavy with the scent of steaming leaves ,</l>
       <l n="11">And rosebuds mouldering on the dripping porch ;</l>
       <l n="12">One twilight , without rise or set of sun ,</l>
       <l n="13">Till beetles drone along the hollow lane ,</l>
       <l n="14">And round the leafless hawthorns , flitting bats</l>
       <l n="15">Hawk the pale moths of winter ? Welcome then</l>
       <l n="16">At best , the flying gleam , the flying shower ,</l>
       <l n="17">The rain-pools glittering on the long white roads ,</l>
       <l n="18">And shadows sweeping on from down to down</l>
       <l n="19">Before the salt Atlantic gale : yet come</l>

       <l n="26">Watches swart arms roll down the precious bales ,</l>
       <l n="27">Spoils of the tropic forests ; year by year</l>

       <l n="31">Beside the bitter wells of treeless sands</l>
       <l n="32">Toward the peaks which flood the ancient Nile ,</l>

       <l n="38">Of full midsummer sun : to them that morn ,</l>
       <l n="39">Gay flowers beneath their feet , gay birds aloft ,</l>
       <l n="40">Shall tell of nought but summer : but to them ,</l>
       <l n="41">Ere yet , unwarned by carol or by chime ,</l>
       <l n="42">They spring into the saddle , thrills may come</l>
       <l n="43">From that great heart of Christendom which beats</l>
       <l n="44">Round all the worlds ; and gracious thoughts of youth ;</l>
       <l n="45">Of steadfast folk , who worship God at home ;</l>
       <l n="46">Of wise words , learnt beside their mothers ’ knee ;</l>

       <l n="48">In awe and joy to listen to the tale</l>
       <l n="49">Of God made man , and in a manger laid —</l>
       <l n="50">May soften , purify , and raise the soul</l>
       <l n="51">From selfish cares , and growing lust of gain ,</l>

       <l n="73">Mere fools of nature ; puppets of strong lusts ,</l>
       <l n="74">Taking the sword , to perish with the sword</l>
       <l n="75">Upon the universal battle-field ,</l>
       <l n="76">Even as the things upon the moor outside ?</l>
       <l n="77">The heath eats up green grass and delicate flowers ,</l>
       <l n="78">The pine eats up the heath , the grub the pine ,</l>
       <l n="79">The finch the grub , the hawk the silly finch ;</l>
       <l n="80">And man , the mightiest of all beasts of prey ,</l>
       <l n="81">Eats what he lists ; the strong eat up the weak ,</l>
       <l n="82">The many eat the few ; great nations , small ;</l>

       <l n="89">All to Himself ? Nay , but Himself to one ;</l>
       <l n="90">Who taught mankind on that first Christmas Day ,</l>
       <l n="91">What ‘ twas to be a man ; to give , not take ;</l>

       <l n="2">Fresh from dear Mundi Juventus .</l>
       <l n="3">When Love and all the world was young ,</l>
       <l n="4">And birds conversed as well as sung ;</l>
       <l n="5">And men still faced this fair creation</l>
       <l n="6">With humour , heart , imagination .</l>
       <l n="7">Who come hither from Morocco</l>
       <l n="8">Every spring on the sirocco ?</l>
       <l n="9">In russet she , and he in yellow ,</l>
       <l n="10">Singing ever clear and mellow ,</l>
       <l n="11">‘ Sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet you , sweet you ,</l>
       <l n="12">Did he beat you ? Did he beat you ? ’</l>
       <l n="13">Phyllopneustes wise folk call them ,</l>
       <l n="14">But do n't know what did befall them ,</l>
       <l n="15">Why they ever thought of coming</l>
       <l n="16">All that way to hear gnats humming ,</l>
       <l n="17">Why they built not nests but houses ,</l>
       <l n="18">Like the bumble-bees and mousies .</l>
       <l n="19">Nor how little birds got wings ,</l>
       <l n="20">Nor what ‘ tis the small cock sings —</l>
       <l n="21">How should they know — stupid fogies ?</l>
       <l n="22">They dare n't even believe in bogies .</l>
       <l n="23">Once they were a girl and boy ,</l>
       <l n="24">Each the other 's life and joy .</l>
       <l n="25">He a Daphnis , she a Chloe ,</l>
       <l n="26">Only they were brown , not snowy ,</l>
       <l n="27">Till an Arab found them playing</l>
       <l n="28">Far beyond the Atlas straying ,</l>
       <l n="29">Tied the helpless things together ,</l>
       <l n="30">Drove them in the burning weather ,</l>
       <l n="31">In his slave-gang many a league ,</l>
       <l n="32">Till they dropped from wild fatigue .</l>
       <l n="33">Up he caught his whip of hide ,</l>
       <l n="34">Lashed each soft brown back and side</l>
       <l n="35">Till their little brains were burst</l>
       <l n="36">With sharp pain , and heat , and thirst ,</l>
       <l n="37">Over her the poor boy lay ,</l>
       <l n="38">Tried to keep the blows away ,</l>
       <l n="39">Till they stiffened into clay ,</l>
       <l n="40">And the ruffian rode away :</l>
       <l n="41">Swooping o'er the tainted ground ,</l>
       <l n="42">Carrion vultures gathered round ,</l>
       <l n="43">And the gaunt hyenas ran</l>
       <l n="44">Tracking up the caravan .</l>
       <l n="45">But — ah , wonder ! that was gone</l>
       <l n="46">Which they meant to feast upon .</l>
       <l n="47">And , for each , a yellow wren ,</l>
       <l n="48">One a cock , and one a hen ,</l>
       <l n="49">Sweetly warbling , flitted forth</l>
       <l n="50">O'er the desert toward the north .</l>
       <l n="51">But a shade of bygone sorrow ,</l>
       <l n="52">Like a dream upon the morrow ,</l>
       <l n="53">Round his tiny brainlet clinging ,</l>
       <l n="54">Sets the wee cock ever singing ,</l>
       <l n="55">‘ Sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet you , sweet you ,</l>
       <l n="56">Did he beat you ? Did he beat you ? ’</l>
       <l n="57">Vultures croaked , and hopped , and flopped ,</l>
       <l n="58">But their evening meal was stopped .</l>
       <l n="59">And the gaunt hyenas foul</l>
       <l n="60">Sat down on their tails to howl .</l>
       <l n="61">Northward towards the cool spring weather ,</l>
       <l n="62">Those two wrens fled on together ,</l>
       <l n="63">On to England o'er the sea ,</l>
       <l n="64">Where all folks alike are free .</l>
       <l n="65">There they built a cabin , wattled</l>
       <l n="66">Like the huts where first they prattled ,</l>
       <l n="67">Hatched and fed , as safe as may be ,</l>
       <l n="68">Many a tiny feathered baby .</l>
       <l n="69">But in autumn south they go</l>
       <l n="70">Past the Straits and Atlas ’ snow ,</l>
       <l n="71">Over desert , over mountain ,</l>
       <l n="72">To the palms beside the fountain ,</l>
       <l n="73">Where , when once they lived before , he</l>
       <l n="74">Told her first the old , old story .</l>
       <l n="75">‘ What do the doves say ? Curuck Coo ,</l>
