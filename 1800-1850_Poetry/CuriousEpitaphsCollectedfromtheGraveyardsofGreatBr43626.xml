    <head>Preface .</head>
    <p n="1">For many years I have collected curious epitaphs , and in this volume I offer the result of my gleanings . An attempt is herein made to furnish a book , not compiled from previously published works , but a collection of curious inscriptions copied from gravestones . Some of the chapters have appeared under my name in Chambers 's Journal , Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News , Newcastle Courant , People 's Journal , ( Dundee ) , Press News , and other publications . I have included a Bibliography of Epitaphs , believing that it will be useful to those who desire to obtain more information on the subject than is presented here . I have not seen any other bibliography of this class of literature , and as a first attempt it must be incomplete . In compiling it I have had the efficient aid of Mr. W. G. B . Page , of the Hull Subscription Library , who has also prepared the Index .</p>
    <p n="2">I must tender my thanks to the following friends for their valued assistance : Mrs. Geo . Linnaeus Banks , author of the “ Manchester Man , ” Mr. W. G. Fretton , F. S. A ., Mr. Walter Hamilton , F. R. G. S ., Mr. Jno . H. Leggott , F. R. H. S ., Rev . R. V. Taylor , B. A ., Mr. H. Vickery , and others whose names appear in the following pages .</p>
    <p n="3">In conclusion , I hope that this book will merit from readers and reviewers a similar welcome to that granted to my former works ; in that case I shall have every reason to be satisfied with my pleasant labour .</p>

    <head>EPITAPHS ON PARISH CLERKS AND SEXTONS .</head>
    <head>Amongst the most curious of the many peculiar epitaphs which are to be found in the quiet resting-places of the departed are those placed to the memory of parish clerks and sextons . We have noted at various times , and at different places , many strange specimens , a few of which we think will entertain our readers .</head>
     <l n="1">In the churchyard of Crayford is a grave-stone bearing the following</l>
     <l n="2">inscription :—</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Here lieth the body OF PETER ISNELL , Thirty years clerk of this Parish . He lived respected as a pious and mirthful man , and died on his way to church to assist at a wedding , On the 31st day of March , 1811 , Aged 70 years .</p>
   <p>The inhabitants of Crayford have raised this stone to his cheerful memory , and as a tribute to his long and faithful services .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The life of this clerk , just three score and ten ,</l>
     <l n="2">Nearly half of which time he had sung out “ Amen ; ”</l>
     <l n="3">In youth he was married , like other young men ,</l>
     <l n="4">But his wife died one day , so he chanted “ Amen . ”</l>
     <l n="5">A second he took , she departed — what then ?</l>
     <l n="6">He married and buried a third with “ Amen . ”</l>
     <l n="7">Thus his joys and his sorrows were treble , but then</l>
     <l n="8">His voice was deep bass , as he sung out “ Amen . ”</l>
     <l n="9">On the horn he could blow as well as most men ;</l>
     <l n="10">So his horn was exalted to blowing “ Amen . ”</l>
     <l n="11">But he lost all his wind after three score and ten ,</l>
     <l n="12">And here , with three wives , he awaits till again</l>
     <l n="13">The trumpet shall rouse him to sing out “ Amen . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="14">In addition to being parish clerk , Frank Raw , of Selby , Yorkshire , was a</l>
     <l n="15">grave-stone cutter , for we are told :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="16">Here lies the body of poor Frank Raw ,</l>
     <l n="17">Parish clerk and grave-stone cutter ,</l>
     <l n="18">And this is writ to let you know</l>
     <l n="19">What Frank for others used to do ,</l>
     <l n="20">Is now for Frank done by another .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The next epitaph , placed to the memory of a parish clerk and bellows-maker , was formerly in the old church of All Saints , Newcastle-on-Tyne :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Here lies Robert Wallas ,</l>
     <l n="2">The King of Good Fellows ,</l>
     <l n="3">Clerk of All-Hallows ,</l>
     <l n="4">And maker of bellows .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">On a slate head-stone , near the south porch of Bingham Church ,</l>
     <l n="6">Nottinghamshire , is inscribed :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">Beneath this stone lies Thomas Hart ,</l>
     <l n="8">Years fifty eight he took the part</l>
     <l n="9">Of Parish Clerk : few did excel .</l>
     <l n="10">Correct he read and sung so well ;</l>
     <l n="11">His words distinct , his voice so clear ,</l>
     <l n="12">Till eighteen hundred and fiftieth year .</l>
     <l n="13">Death cut the brittle thread , and then</l>
     <l n="14">A period put to his Amen .</l>
     <l n="15">At eighty-two his breath resigned ,</l>
     <l n="16">To meet the fate of all mankind ;</l>
     <l n="17">The third of May his soul took flight</l>
     <l n="18">To mansions of eternal light .</l>
     <l n="19">The bell for him with awful tone</l>
     <l n="20">His body summoned to the tomb .</l>
     <l n="21">Oh ! may his sins be all forgiv'n</l>
     <l n="22">And Christ receive him into heav'n .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In the same county , from the churchyard of Ratcliffe on Soar , we have a curious epitaph to the memory of Robert Smith , who died in 1782 , aged 82 years :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Fifty-five years it was , and something more ,</l>
     <l n="2">Clerk of this parish he the office bore ,</l>
     <l n="3">And in that space , ‘ tis awful to declare ,</l>
     <l n="4">Two generations buried by him were !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In a note by Mr. Llewllynn Jewitt , F. S. A ., we are told that with the clerkship of Bakewell church , the “ vocal powers ” of its holders , appear to have been to some extent hereditary , if we may judge by the inscriptions recording the deaths and the abilities of two members of the family of Roe which are found on grave-stones in the churchyard there . The first of these , recording the death of Samuel Roe , is as under :—</p>
   <p>To The memory of SAMUEL ROE , Clerk Of the Parish Church of Bakewell , Which office He filled thirty-five years With credit to himself And satisfaction to the Inhabitants . His natural powers of voice , In clearness , strength , and sweetness Were altogether unequalled . He died October 31st , 1792 , Aged 70 years . died aged Sarah his third wife | 1811 | 77 Charles their son | 1810 | 52</p>
   <p>He had three wives , Millicent , who died in 1745 , aged 22 ; Dorothy , who died 1754 , aged 28 ; and Sarah , who survived him and died in 1811 , at the age of 77 . A grave-stone records the death of his first two wives as follows , and the third is commemorated in the above inscription .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Millicent ,</l>
     <l n="2">Wife of Saml Roe ,</l>
     <l n="3">She died Sepr 16th , 1745 , aged 22 .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">Dorothy ,</l>
     <l n="5">Wife of Saml Roe ,</l>
     <l n="6">She died Novr 13th , 1754 , aged 28 .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">Respecting the above-mentioned Samuel Roe , a contributor to the</l>
     <l n="8">Gentleman 's Magazine wrote , on February 13th , 1794 :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="9">“ Mr. Urban ,</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ It was with much concern that I read the epitaph upon Mr. Roe , in your last volume , p. 1192 . Upon a little tour which I made in Derbyshire , in 1789 , I met with that worthy and very intelligent man at Bakewell , and , in the course of my antiquarian researches there , derived no inconsiderable assistance from his zeal and civility . If he did not possess the learning of his namesake , your old and valuable correspondent , I will venture to declare that he was not less influenced by a love and veneration for antiquity , many proofs of which he had given by his care and attention to the monuments in the church , which were committed to his charge ; for he united the characters of sexton , clerk , singing-master , will-maker , and school-master . Finding that I was quite alone , he requested permission to wait upon me at the inn in the evening , urging , as a reason for this request , that he must be exceedingly gratified by the conversation of a gentleman who could read the characters upon the monument of Vernon , the founder of Haddon House , a treat he had not met with for many years . After a very pleasant gossip we parted , but not till my honest friend had , after some apparent struggle , begged of me to indulge him with my name . ”</p>
   <p>To his careful attention is to be attributed the preservation of the curious Vernon and other monuments in the church , over which in some instances he placed wooden framework to keep off the rough hands and rougher knives of the boys and young men of the congregation . He also watched with special care over the Wendesley tomb , and even took careful rubbings of the inscriptions .</p>
   <p>While speaking of this Mr. Roe , it may be well to put the readers of this work in possession of an interesting fact in connection with the name of Roe , or Row . The writer above , in his letter to Mr. Urban , says , “ If he did not possess the learning of his namesake , your old and valued correspondent , ” &amp; c. By this he means “ T Row , ” whose contributions to the Gent 's . Mag . were very numerous and interesting . The writer under this signature was the Rev . Samuel Pegge , rector of Whittington , and the letters forming this pseudonym were the initials of the words , T [ he ] R [ ector ] O [ f ] W [ hittington ] .</p>
   <p>Philip Roe , who succeeded his father ( Samuel Roe ) as parish clerk of Bakewell , was his son by his third wife . He was born in 1763 , and succeeded his father in full parochial honours in 1792 , having , we believe , for some time previously acted as his deputy . He died in 1815 , aged 52 years , and was buried with the other members of the family . The following curious inscription appears on his grave-stone :—</p>
   <p>Erected In remembrance of PHILIP ROE who died 12th September , 1815 AGED 52 YEARS .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The vocal Powers here let us mark</l>
     <l n="2">Of Philip our late Parish Clerk</l>
     <l n="3">In Church none ever heard a Layman</l>
     <l n="4">With a clearer Voice say “ Amen ! ”</l>
     <l n="5">Who now with Hallelujahs Sound</l>
     <l n="6">Like Him can make the Roofs rebound ?</l>
     <l n="7">The Choir lament his Choral Tones</l>
     <l n="8">The Town — so soon Here lie his Bones .</l>
     <l n="9">“ Sleep undisturb 'd within thy peaceful shrine</l>
     <l n="10">Till Angels wake thee with such notes as thine . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Also of SARAH his wife who departed this life on the 24th of January 1817 aged 51 years .</p>
   <p>Our genial friend , Cuthbert Bede , B. A ., author of “ Verdant Green , ” tells us , “ As a boy I often attended the service at Belbroughton Church , Worcestershire , where the parish clerk was Mr. Osborne , tailor . His family had there been parish clerks and tailors since the time of Henry the Eighth , and were lineally descended from William FitzOsborne , who , in the twelfth century , had been deprived by Ralph FitzHerbert of his right to the manor of Bellem , in the parish of Belbroughton . Often have I stood in the picturesque churchyard of Wolverley , Worcestershire , by the grave of its old parish clerk , whom I well remember , old Thomas Worrall , the inscription on whose monument is as follows :—</p>
   <p>Sacred to the Memory of THOMAS WORRALL , Parish Clerk of Wolverley for a period of forty-seven years . Died A. D. 1854 , February 23rd . Aged 76 years .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ He served with faithfulness in humble sphere ,</l>
     <l n="2">As one who could his talent well employ .</l>
     <l n="3">Hope that when Christ his Lord shall reappear ,</l>
     <l n="4">He may be bidden to his Master 's joy . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">This tombstone was erected to the memory of the deceased</l>
     <l n="6">by a few of the parishioners in testimony of his worth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">April , 1855 . Charles R. Somers Cocks , vicar .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>It may be noted of this worthy parish clerk that , with the exception of a week or two before his death , he was never once absent from his Sunday and weekday duties in the forty-seven years during which he held office . He succeeded his father , James Worrall , who died in 1806 , aged seventy-nine , after being parish clerk of Wolverley for thirty years . His tombstone , near to that of his son , was erected “ to record his worth both in his public and private character , and as a mark of personal esteem — h. l. F. H. &amp; W. C. p. c . ” I am told that these initials stand for F. Hurtle and the Rev . William Callow , and that the latter was the author of the following lines inscribed on the monument , which are well worth quoting :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ If courtly bards adorn each statesman 's bust ,</l>
     <l n="2">And strew their laurels o'er each warrior 's dust</l>
     <l n="3">Alike immortalise , as good and great ,</l>
     <l n="4">Him who enslaved as him who saved the state ,</l>
     <l n="5">Surely the muse ( a rustic minstrel ) may</l>
     <l n="6">Drop one wild flower upon a poor man 's clay ;</l>
     <l n="7">This artless tribute to his mem'ry give</l>
     <l n="8">Whose life was such as heroes seldom live .</l>
     <l n="9">In worldly knowledge , poor indeed his store —</l>
     <l n="10">He knew the village and he scarce knew more .</l>
     <l n="11">The worth of heavenly truth he justly knew —</l>
     <l n="12">In faith a Christian , and in practice too .</l>
     <l n="13">Yes , here lies one , excel him ye who can ;</l>
     <l n="14">Go ! imitate the virtues of that man ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>First amongst notable sextons is the name of Old Scarlett , who died July 2 , 1591 , at the good old age of ninety-eight , and occupied for a long time the position as sexton of Peterborough Cathedral . He buried two generations of his fellow-creatures . A portrait of him , placed at the west end of that noble church , has perpetuated his fame , and caused him to be introduced in effigy in various publications . Dr. Robert Chambers in his entertaining work , the “ Book of Days , ” writes : “ And what a lively effigy — short , stout , hardy , and self-complacent , perfectly satisfied , and perhaps even proud , of his profession , and content to be exhibited with all its insignia about him ! Two queens had passed through his hands into that bed which gives a lasting rest to queens and to peasants alike . An officer of Death , who had so long defied his principal , could not but have made some impression on the minds of bishop , dean , prebends , and other magnates of the Cathedral , and hence , as we may suppose , the erection of this lively portraiture of the old man , which is believed to have been only once renewed since it was first put up . Dr. Dibdin , who last copied it , tells us that ‘ Old Scarlett 's jacket and trunkhose are of a brownish red , his stockings blue , his shoes black , tied with blue ribbons , and the soles of his feet red . The cap upon his head is red , and so also is the ground of the coat armour . ’ ”</p>
   <p>The following lines below his portrait are characteristic of his age :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">You see old Scarlett 's picture stand on hie ;</l>
     <l n="2">But at your feet here doth his body lye .</l>
     <l n="3">His gravestone doth his age and death-time show ,</l>
     <l n="4">His office by heis token [ s ] you may know .</l>
     <l n="5">Second to none for strength and sturdy lymm ,</l>
     <l n="6">A scare-babe mighty voice , with visage grim ;</l>
     <l n="7">He had inter 'd two queenes within this place ,</l>
     <l n="8">And this townes householders in his life 's space</l>
     <l n="9">Twice over ; but at length his own time came</l>
     <l n="10">What he for others did , for him the same</l>
     <l n="11">Was done : no doubt his soule doth live for aye ,</l>
     <l n="12">In heaven , though his body clad in clay .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The first of the queens interred by Scarlett was Catherine , the divorced wife of Henry VIII , who died in 1535 , at Kimbolton Castle , in Huntingdonshire . The second was Mary Queen of Scots , who was beheaded at Fotheringay in 1587 , and first interred here , though subsequently transported to Westminster Abbey .</p>
   <p>Our next example is from Bingley , Yorkshire :—</p>
   <p>In memory of Hezekiah Briggs , who died August 5th , 1844 , in the 80th year of his age . He was sexton at this church 43 years , and interred upwards of 7000 corpses .</p>
   <note>Here the names of his wife and several children are given .</note>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Here lies an old ringer , beneath the cold clay ,</l>
     <l n="2">Who has rung many peals both for serious and gay ;</l>
     <l n="3">Through Grandsire and Trebles with ease he could range ,</l>
     <l n="4">Till death called a Bob , which brought round the last change .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">For all the village came to him</l>
     <l n="6">When they had need to call ;</l>
     <l n="7">His counsel free to all was given ,</l>
     <l n="8">For he was kind to all .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Ring on , ring on , sweet Sabbath bell ,</l>
     <l n="10">Still kind to me thy matins swell ,</l>
     <l n="11">And when from earthly things i part ,</l>
     <l n="12">Sigh o'er my grave , and lull my heart .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">An upright stone in the burial ground at Hartwith Chapel , in Nidderdale ,</l>
     <l n="14">Yorkshire , bears the following inscription :—</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In memory of William Darnbrough , who for the last forty years of his life was sexton of this chapel . He died October 3rd , 1846 , in the one hundreth year of his age .</p>
   <p>“ Thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace ; thou shalt be buried in a good old age . ” — Genesis xv . 15 .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The graves around for many a year</l>
     <l n="2">Were dug by him who slumbers here ,—</l>
     <l n="3">Till worn with age , he dropped his spade ,</l>
     <l n="4">And in the dust his bones were laid .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The trade of printer is rich in technical terms available for the writer</l>
     <l n="2">of epitaphs , as will be seen in the following examples .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">Our first inscription is from St. Margaret 's Church , Westminster , placed</l>
     <l n="4">in remembrance of England 's benefactor , the first English printer :—</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>To the memory of WILLIAM CAXTON , who first introduced into Great Britain the Art of Printing ; And who , A. D. 1477 or earlier , exercised that art in the Abbey of Westminster . This Tablet , In remembrance of one to whom the literature of this country is so largely indebted , was raised , anno Domini MDCCCXX ., by the Roxburghe Club , Earl Spencer , K. G ., President .</p>
   <p>The next is in memory of one Edward Jones , ob . 1705-6 , aet . 53 . He was the “ Gazette ” Printer of the Savoy , and the following epitaph was appended to an elegy , entitled , “ The Mercury Hawkers in Mourning , ” and published on the occasion of his death :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Here lies a Printer , famous in his time ,</l>
     <l n="2">Whose life by lingering sickness did decline .</l>
     <l n="3">He lived in credit , and in peace he died ,</l>
     <l n="4">And often had the chance of Fortune tried .</l>
     <l n="5">Whose smiles by various methods did promote</l>
     <l n="6">Him to the favour of the Senate 's vote ;</l>
     <l n="7">And so became , by National consent ,</l>
     <l n="8">The only Printer of the Parliament .</l>
     <l n="9">Thus by degrees , so prosp'rous was his fate ,</l>
     <l n="10">He left his heirs a very good estate .</l>

     <l n="11">Another is on a noted printer and bookseller in his day , Jacob Tonson , who</l>
     <l n="12">died in 1735 :—</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The volume of his life being finished , here is the end of Jacob Tonson . Weep , authors , and break your pens ; your Tonson , effaced from the book , is no more ; but print the last inscription on this last page of death , for fear that , delivered to the press of the grave , he , the Editor , should want a title . Here lies a bookseller , the leaf of his life being finished , awaiting a new edition , augmented and corrected .</p>
   <p>The celebrated Dr. Benjamin Franklin imitated the above , and designed it for himself :—</p>
   <p>The body of B. Franklin , Printer , like the cover of an old book , its contents torn out , and stripped of its lettering and gilding , lies here , food for worms . But the work shall not be wholly lost , for it will , as he believed , appear once more , in a new and more perfect edition , corrected and amended by the Author . He was born Jan. 6 , 1706 . Died ———, 17 —. B. F .</p>
   <p>Franklin died on the 17th of April , 1790 , aged eighty-four years . After the death of this sturdy patriot and sagacious writer , the following singular sentiment was inscribed to his memory :—</p>
   <p>Benjamin Franklin , the * of his profession ; the type of honesty ; the ! of all ; and although the [ Symbol : hand ] of death put a . to his existence , each Sec . of his life is without a ||.</p>
   <p>On a plain , flat slab in the burial-ground of Christ-church , Philadelphia , the following simple inscription appears over the remains of the good man and his worthy wife :—</p>

     <l n="3">Deborah }</l>

   <p>The pun on the supersession of an old edition by a new and revised one , has often been worked out , as in the following example , which is that of the Rev . John Cotton , who died in New England , in 1652 :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A living , breathing Bible ; tables where</l>

     <l n="4">His head an index to the sacred volume !</l>
     <l n="5">His very name a title-page ; and , next ,</l>
     <l n="6">His life a commentary on the text .</l>
     <l n="7">Oh , what a moment of glorious worth ,</l>
     <l n="8">When in a new edition he comes forth !</l>

     <l n="11">A notable epitaph was that of George Faulkner , the alderman and printer ,</l>

     <l n="18">So dauntless when imprisoned in her cause ;</l>
     <l n="19">No alderman e'er graced a weighter board ,</l>
     <l n="20">No wit e'er joked more freely with a lord .</l>
     <l n="21">None could with him in anecdotes confer ;</l>
     <l n="22">A perfect annal-book , in Elzevir .</l>

     <l n="27">Yet , George , we see that one lot awaits them all ,</l>
     <l n="28">Gigantic folios , or octavos small ;</l>
     <l n="29">One universal finis claims his rank ,</l>
     <l n="30">And every volume closes in a blank .</l>

   <p>In the churchyard of Bury St. Edmunds , Suffolk , is a good specimen of a typographical epitaph , placed in remembrance of a noted printer , who died in the year 1818 . It reads as follows :</p>
   <p>Here lie the remains of L. GEDGE , Printer . Like a worn-out character , he has returned to the Founder , Hoping that he will be re-cast in a better and more perfect mould .</p>
   <p>Our next example is profuse of puns , some of which are rather obscure to younger readers , owing to the disuse of the old wooden press . It is the epitaph of a Scotch printer :—</p>
   <p>Sacred to the memory of ADAM WILLIAMSON , Pressman-printer , in Edinburgh , Who died Oct. 3 , 1832 , Aged 72 years .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">All my stays are loosed ;</l>
     <l n="2">My cap is thrown off ; my head is worn out ;</l>
     <l n="3">My box is broken ;</l>
     <l n="4">My spindle and bar have lost their power ;</l>
     <l n="5">My till is laid aside ;</l>
     <l n="6">Both legs of my crane are turned out of their path ;</l>
     <l n="7">My platen can make no impression ;</l>
     <l n="8">My winter hath no spring ;</l>
     <l n="9">My rounce will neither roll out nor in ;</l>
     <l n="10">Stone , coffin , and carriage have all failed ;</l>
     <l n="11">The hinges of my tympan and frisket are immovable ;</l>
     <l n="12">My long and short ribs are rusted ;</l>
     <l n="13">My cheeks are much worm-eaten and mouldering</l>
     <l n="14">away :</l>
     <l n="15">My press is totally down :</l>
     <l n="16">The volume of my life is finished ,</l>
     <l n="17">Not without many errors ;</l>
     <l n="18">Most of them have arisen from bad composition , and</l>
     <l n="19">are to be attributed more to the chase than the</l>
     <l n="20">press ;</l>
     <l n="21">There are also a great number of my own :</l>
     <l n="22">Misses , scuffs , blotches , blurs , and bad register ;</l>
     <l n="23">But the true and faithful Superintendent has undertaken</l>
     <l n="24">to correct the whole .</l>
     <l n="25">When the machine is again set up</l>
     <l n="26">( incapable of decay ) ,</l>
     <l n="27">A new and perfect edition of my life will appear ,</l>
     <l n="28">Elegantly bound for duration , and every way fitted</l>
     <l n="29">for the grand Library of the Great Author .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The next specimen is less satisfactory , because devoid of the hope that should encircle the death of the Christian . It is the epitaph which Baskerville , the celebrated Birmingham printer and type founder , directed to be placed upon a tomb of masonry in the shape of a cone , and erected over his remains :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Stranger</l>
     <l n="2">Beneath this cone , in unconsecrated ground ,</l>
     <l n="3">A friend to the liberties of mankind</l>
     <l n="4">Directed his body to be inurned .</l>
     <l n="5">May the example contribute to emancipate thy mind</l>
     <l n="6">from the idle fears of superstition , and the</l>
     <l n="7">wicked arts of priestcraft .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It is recorded that “ The tomb has long since been overturned , and even the remains of the man himself desecrated and dispersed till the final day of resurrection , when the atheism which in his later years he professed , will receive assuredly so complete and overwhelming a refutation . ”</p>
   <p>In 1599 died Christopher Barker , one of the most celebrated of the sixteenth century typographers , printer to Queen Elizabeth — to whom , in fact , the present patent , held by Eyre and Spottiswode , can be traced back in unbroken succession .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Here Barker lies , once printer to the Crown ,</l>
     <l n="2">Whose works of art acquired a vast renown .</l>
     <l n="3">Time saw his worth , and spread around his fame ,</l>
     <l n="4">That future printers might imprint the same .</l>
     <l n="5">But when his strength could work the press no more</l>
     <l n="6">And his last sheets were folded into store ,</l>
     <l n="7">Pure faith , with hope ( the greatest treasure given ) ,</l>
     <l n="8">Opened their gates , and bade him pass to heaven .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>We shall bring to a close our examples of typographical epitaphs with the following , copied from the graveyard of St. Michael 's , Coventry , on a worthy printer who was engaged over sixty years as a compositor on the Coventry Mercury :—</p>
   <p>Here lies inter 'd the mortal remains of JOHN HULM , Printer , who , like an old , worn-out type , battered by frequent use , reposes in the grave . But not without a hope that at some future time he might be cast in the mould of righteousness , And safely locked-up in the chase of immortality . He was distributed from the board of life on the 9th day of Sept ., 1827 , Aged 75 . Regretted by his employers , and respected by his fellow artists .</p>

   <p>Of the many epitaphs on sportsmen to be seen in Nottinghamshire , we cull a few of the choicest . Our first is a literal copy from a weather-worn stone in Eakring churchyard , placed to the memory of Henry Cartwright , senior keeper to his Grace the Duke of Kingston for fifty-five years , who died February 13th , 1773 , aged eighty years , ten months , and three weeks :—</p>

     <l n="6">the burial Plains , but now no more .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>We next present particulars of a celebrated deer-stealer . According to a notice furnished in the “ Nottingham Date Book , ” the deeds of Tom Booth were for many years after his death a never-failing subject of conversational interest in Nottingham . It is stated that no modern deer-stealer was anything like so popular . Thorsby relates one exploit as follows : “ In Nottingham Park , at one time , was a favourite fine deer , a chief ranger , on which Tom and his wily companions had often cast their eyes ; but how to deceive the keeper while they killed it was a task of difficulty . The night , however , in which they accomplished their purpose — whether by any settled plan or not is not known — they found the keeper at watch , as usual , in a certain place in the park . One of them , therefore , went in an opposite direction in the park , and fired his gun to make the keeper believe he had shot a deer ; upon which away goes the keeper , in haste , to the spot , which was at a very considerable distance from the place where the favourite deer was , and near which Tom Booth was skulking . Tom , waiting a proper time , when he thought the keeper at a sufficient distance for accomplishing his purpose , fired and killed the deer , and dragged it through the river Leen undiscovered . ” Booth was a stout man , and by trade a whitesmith . The stone marking the place of his interment is still in good preservation , and stands in St. Nicholas ’ burial-ground , against the southern wall of the church . It bears the following inscription :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Here lies a marksman , who with art and skill ,</l>
     <l n="2">When young and strong , fat bucks and does did kill .</l>
     <l n="3">Now conquered by grim Death ( go , reader , tell it ! )</l>
     <l n="4">He 's now took leave of powder , gun , and pellet .</l>
     <l n="5">A fatal dart , which in the dark did fly ,</l>
     <l n="6">Has laid him down , among the dead to lie .</l>
     <l n="7">If any want to know the poor slave 's name ,</l>
     <l n="8">‘ Tis old Tom Booth ,— ne'er ask from whence he came .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Old Tom was so highly pleased with the epitaph , which was written before his death , that he had it engraved on the stone some months before its services were required . In addition to the epitaph itself , the head-stone was made to include Booth 's name , &amp; c ., and also that of his wife , blank places being left in each case for the age and time of death . Booth 's compartment of the stone was in due course properly filled up ; but the widow , disliking the exhibition of her name on a tombstone while living , resolved that such stone should never indicate her resting place when dead ; she accordingly left an injunction that her body be interred elsewhere , and the inscription is incomplete to this day .</p>
   <p>Some time before Amos Street , a celebrated Yorkshire huntsman died , a stone was obtained , and on it engraved the following lines :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">This is to the memory of Old Amos ,</l>
     <l n="2">Who was when alive for hunting famous ;</l>

     <l n="9">Poor “ Old Amos ” passed away on October 3rd , 1777 , and was buried in</l>
     <l n="10">Birstal churchyard . The foregoing inscription may still be read .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The Rev . R. H. Whitworth tells us : “ There is an old monument in the south aisle of Blidworth Church , to the memory of Thomas Leake , Esq ., who was killed at Blidworth Rocking in A. D. 1598 . He may be regarded as the last of the race who sat in Robin Hood 's seat , if those restless Forest Chiefs , typified under that name , can be supposed ever to have sat at all . Leake held office under the Crown , but was as wild a freebooter as ever drew bow . His character is portrayed in his epitaph —</p>
   <p>HERE RESTS T. LEAKE WHOSE VERTUES WEERE SO KNOWNE IN ALL THESE PARTS THAT THIS ENGRAVED STONE NEEDS NAVGHT RELATE BVT HIS VNTIMELY END WHICH WAS IN SINGLE FIGHT : WYLST YOUTH DID LEND HIS AYDE TO VALOR , HEE WTH EASE OREPAST MANY SLYGHT DANGERS , GREATER THEN THIS LAST BVT WILLFVLLE FATE IN THESE THINGS GOVERNS ALL HEE TOWLD OVT THREESCORE YEARS BEFORE HIS FALL MOST OF WCH TYME HE WASTED IN THIS WOOD MVCH OF HIS WEALTH AND LAST OF ALL HIS BLOOD</p>
   <p>The border of this monument is rudely panelled , each panel having some forest hunting subject in relief . There are hounds getting scent , and a hound pursuing an antlered stag ; a hunting horn , ribboned ; plunging and flaying knives , a cross-bow , a forest-bow , two arrows , and two hunters ’ belts with arrows inserted . This is his register —</p>
   <p>Thomas Leake , esquire , buried the 4th February , 1598 .</p>
   <p>There is a captivating bit of romance connected with Leake 's death , which occurred at Archer 's Water . Although somewhat ‘ provectus in aetate , ’ he had won the affections of the landlady 's daughter , much to the annoyance of the mother . Archer 's Water was on the old driftroad by Blidworth , from Edinburgh to London , that by which Jeannie Deans travelled , and over which Dick Turpin rode . Hundreds of thousands of Scotch cattle went by this way to town , and there was a difficulty connected with a few of them in which Leake was concerned , and a price being set upon his head , his mother-in-law , that was to be , betrayed him to two young soldiers anxious to secure the reward , one of whom was , in the mother 's eyes , the more favoured lover . Tom was always attended by two magnificent dogs and went well armed . Thrown off his guard he left his dogs in an outhouse , and entering the inn laid aside his weapons , when he was set upon and overpowered , and like many better men before him , slain . The name of a Captain Salmond of the now extinct parish or manor of Salterford is connected with this transaction . The date of the combat is 2nd February , being the festival of the Presentation of Christ in the Temple , with which the highly interesting and historical observance of Blidworth Rocking is connected . Within the memory of living men , a baby decked with such flowers as the season afforded , was placed in a cradle and carried about from house to house by an old man , who received a present on the occasion . As the church is dedicated to St. Mary in connection with the Purification , the 2nd of February being the Feast Day , this is probably an interesting reminiscence of some old species of Miracle Play , or observance connected with the foundation . Anciently people from all neighbouring counties used to attend this season . Forest games were played , and amid the attendant licence and confusion , Leake came to his last grief . Not only in the church does this Ranger of the Blidworth Wood , for this was his office , possess a memorial . A large cross was erected , now standing at Fountain Dale , thus inscribed :—</p>

   <p>Ab antiqua sede remotum H. P. C. Joannes Downall Prid . Non Sext . MDCCCXXXVI .</p>
   <p>What became of the daughter tradition sayeth not . Doubtless she died , as Tom Leake 's intended bride ought , of grief , and was buried under some grand old oak in Blidworth Forest . ”</p>
   <p>Let us direct attention to another class of sportsmen . At Bunney , a monument is erected to Sir Thomas Parkyns , the well-known wrestler . It bears four lines in Latin , which have been translated thus :—</p>

   <p>EPITAPHS ON TRADESMEN .</p>
   <p>Many interesting epitaphs are placed to the memory of tradesmen . Often they are not of an elevating character , nor highly poetical , but they display the whims and oddities of men . We will first present a few relating to the watch and clock-making trade . The first specimen is from Lydford churchyard , on the borders of Dartmoor :—</p>
   <p>Here lies , in horizontal position , the outside case of GEORGE ROUTLEIGH , Watchmaker ; Whose abilities in that line were an honour to his profession . Integrity was the Mainspring , and prudence the Regulator , of all the actions of his life . Humane , generous , and liberal , his Hand never stopped till he had relieved distress . So nicely regulated were all his motions , that he never went wrong , except when set a-going by people who did not know his Key ; even then he was easily set right again . He had the art of disposing his time so well , that his hours glided away in one continual round of pleasure and delight , until an unlucky minute put a period to his existence . He departed this life Nov. 14 , 1802 , aged 57 : wound up , in hopes of being taken in hand by his Maker ; and of being thoroughly cleaned , repaired , and set a-going in the world to come .</p>

     <l n="25">The following is from Bolsover churchyard , Derbyshire :—</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Here lies , in a horizontal position , the outside case of THOMAS HINDE , Clock and Watch-maker , Who departed this life , wound up in hope of being taken in hand by his Maker , and being thoroughly cleaned , repaired , and set a-going in the world to come , On the 15th of August , 1836 , In the 19th year of his age .</p>
   <p>Respecting the next example , our friend , Mr. Edward Walford , M. A ., wrote to the Times as follows : “ Close to the south-western corner of the parish churchyard of Hampstead there has long stood a square tomb , with a scarcely decipherable inscription , to the memory of a man of science of the last century , whose name is connected with the history of practical navigation . The tomb , having stood there for more than a century , had become somewhat dilapidated , and has lately undergone a careful restoration at the cost and under the supervision of the Company of Clockmakers , and the fact is recorded in large characters on the upper face . The tops of the upright iron railings which surround the tomb have been gilt , and the restored inscription runs as follows : ‘ In memory of Mr. John Harrison , late of Red Lion-square , London , inventor of the time-keeper for ascertaining the longitude at sea . He was born at Foulby , in the county of York , and was the son of a builder of that place , who brought him up to the same profession . Before he attained the age of 21 , he , without any instruction , employed himself in cleaning and repairing clocks and watches , and made a few of the former , chiefly of wood . At the age of 25 he employed his whole time in chronometrical improvements . He was the inventor of the gridiron pendulum , and the method of preventing the effects of heat and cold upon time-keepers by two bars fixed together ; he introduced the secondary spring , to keep them going while winding up , and was the inventor of most ( or all ) the improvements in clocks and watches during his time . In the year 1735 his first time-keeper was sent to Lisbon , and in 1764 his then much improved fourth time-keeper having been sent to Barbadoes , the Commissioners of Longitude certified that he had determined the longitude within one-third of half a degree of a great circle , having not erred more than forty seconds in time . After sixty years ’ close application to the above pursuits , he departed this life on the 24th day of March , 1776 , aged 83 .</p>
   <p>In an epitaph in High Wycombe churchyard , life is compared to the working of a clock . It runs thus :—</p>

     <l n="5">That mellows long ,</l>
     <l n="6">Even wondered at</l>
     <l n="7">Because he dropt not sooner .</l>
     <l n="8">Providence seemed to wind him up</l>
     <l n="9">For fourscore years ,</l>
     <l n="10">Yet ran he nine winters more ;</l>
     <l n="11">Till , like a clock ,</l>

   <p>The well-known blacksmith 's epitaph , said to be written by the poet Hayley , may be found in many churchyards in this country . It formed the subject of a sermon delivered on Sunday , the 27th day of August , 1837 , by the then Vicar of Crich , Derbyshire , to a large assembly . We are told that the vicar appeared much excited , and read the prayers in a hurried manner . Without leaving the desk , he proceeded to address his flock for the last time ; and the following is the substance thereof : “ To-morrow , my friends , this living will be vacant , and if any one of you is desirous of becoming my successor he has now an opportunity . Let him use his influence , and who can tell but he may be honoured with the title of Vicar of Crich . As this is my last address , I shall only say , had I been a blacksmith , or a son of Vulcan , the following lines might not have been inappropriate :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">My sledge and hammer lie reclined ,</l>
     <l n="2">My bellows , too , have lost their wind ;</l>
     <l n="3">My fire 's extinct , my forge decayed ,</l>
     <l n="4">And in the dust my vice is laid .</l>
     <l n="5">My coal is spent , my iron 's gone ,</l>
     <l n="6">My nails are drove , my work is done ;</l>
     <l n="7">My fire-dried corpse lies here at rest ,</l>
     <l n="8">And , smoke-like , soars up to be bless 'd .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>If you expect anything more , you are deceived ; for I shall only say , Friends , farewell , farewell ! ” The effect of this address was too visible to pass unnoticed . Some appeared as if awakened from a fearful dream , and gazed at each other in silent astonishment ; others for whom it was too powerful for their risible nerves to resist , burst into boisterous laughter , while one and all slowly retired from the scene , to exercise their future cogitations on the farewell discourse of their late pastor .</p>

   <p>In Wimbledon churchyard is the grave of John Martin , a natural son of Don John Emanuel , King of Portugal . He was sent to this country about the year 1712 , to be out of the way of his friends , and after several changes of circumstances , ultimately became a gardener . It will be seen from the following epitaph that he won the esteem of his employers :—</p>
   <p>To the memory of John Martin , gardener , a native of Portugal , who cultivated here , with industry and success , the same ground under three masters , forty years .</p>

     <l n="1">Though skilful and experienced ,</l>

     <l n="8">As he was a careful husband , a tender father ,</l>
     <l n="9">and an honest man .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This character of him is given to posterity by his last master , willingly because deservedly , as a lasting testimony of his great regard for so good a servant .</p>
   <p>He died March 30th , 1760 . Aged 66 years .</p>

   <p>We have here an epitaph on a grocer , culled from the Rev . C. W. Bardsley 's “ Memorials of St. Anne 's Church , ” Manchester . In a note about the name of Howard , the author says : “ Poor John Howard 's friends gave him an unfortunate epitaph — one , too , that reflected unkindly upon his wife . It may still be seen in the churchyard .— Here lyeth the body of John Howard , who died Jan. 2 , 1800 , aged 84 years ; fifty years a respectable grocer , and an honest man . As it is further stated that his wife died in 1749 , fifty years before , it would seem that her husband 's honesty dated from the day of her decease . Mrs. Malaprop herself , in her happiest moments , could not have beaten this inscription . ”</p>

   <p>The cause of the foregoing curious epitaph is thus explained . Thomas Clay was a man of intemperate habits , and at the time of his death was indebted to the village innkeeper , named Adlington , to the amount of twenty pounds . The publican resolved to seize the body ; but the parents of the deceased carefully kept the door locked until the day appointed for the funeral . As soon as the door was opened , Adlington rushed into the house , seized the corpse , and placed it on a form in the open street in front of the residence of the parents of the departed . Clay 's friends refused to discharge the publican 's account . After the body had been exposed for several days , Adlington committed it to the ground in a bacon chest .</p>

   <p>The stirring lives of many female soldiers have furnished facts for several important historical works , and rich materials for the writers of romance . We give an illustration of the stone erected by public subscription in Brighton churchyard over the remains of a notable female warrior , named Phoebe Hessel . The inscription tells the story of her long and eventful career . The closing years of her life were cheered by the liberality of George IV . During a visit to Brighton , when he was Prince Regent , he met old Phoebe , and was greatly interested in her history . He ascertained that she was supported by a few benevolent townsmen , and the kind-hearted Prince questioned her respecting the amount that would be required to enable her to pass the remainder of her days in comfort . “ Half-a-guinea a week ” said Phoebe Hessel , “ will make me as happy as a princess . ” That amount by order of her royal benefactor was paid to her until the day of her death . She told capital stories , had an excellent memory , and was in every respect most agreeable company . Her faculties remained unimpared to within a few hours of her death . On September 22 , 1821 , she was visited by a person of some literary taste , and the following particulars were obtained respecting her life . The writer states :</p>
   <p>“ I have seen to-day an extraordinary character in the person of Phoebe Hessel , a poor woman stated to be 106 years of age . It appears that she was born in March 1715 , and at fifteen formed a strong attachment to Samuel Golding , a private in the regiment called Kirk 's Lambs , which was ordered to the West Indies . She determined to follow her lover , enlisted into the 5th regiment of foot , commanded by General Pearce , and embarked after him . She served there five years without discovering herself to anyone . At length they were ordered to Gibraltar . She was likewise at Montserrat , and would have been in action , but her regiment did not reach the place till the battle was decided . Her lover was wounded at Gibraltar and sent to Plymouth ; she then waited on the General 's lady at Gibraltar , disclosed her sex , told her story , and was immediately sent home . On her arrival , Phoebe went to Samuel Golding in the hospital , nursed him there , and when he came out , married and lived with him for twenty years ; he had a pension from Chelsea . After Golding 's death , she married Hessel , has had many children , and has been many years a widow . Her eldest son was a sailor with Admiral Norris : he afterwards went to the East Indies , and , if he is now alive , must be nearly seventy years of age . The rest of the family are dead . At an advanced age , she earned a scanty livelihood at Brighton by selling apples and gingerbread on the Marine Parade .</p>

   <p>“ I saw this woman to-day in her bed , to which she is confined from having lost the use of her limbs . She has even now , old and withered as she is , a characteristic countenance , and , I should judge from her present appearance , must have had a fine , though perhaps a masculine style of head when young . I have seen many a woman at the age of sixty or seventy look older than she does under the load of 108 years of human life . Her cheeks are round and seem firm , though ploughed with many a small wrinkle . Her eyes , though their sight is gone , are large and well formed . As soon as it was announced that somebody had come to see her , she broke the silence of her solitary thoughts and spoke . She began in a complaining tone , as if the remains of a strong and restless spirit were impatient of the prison of a decaying and weak body . ‘ Other people die , and I cannot , ’ she said . Upon exciting her recollection of former days , her energy seemed roused , and she spoke with emphasis . Her voice was strong for an old person ; and I could easily believe her when , upon being asked if her sex was not in danger of being detected by her voice , she replied that she always had a strong and manly voice . She appeared to take a pride in having kept her secret , declaring that she told it to no man , woman , or child , during the time she was in the army ; ‘ for you know , Sir , a drunken man and a child always tell the truth . But , ’ said she , ‘ I told my secret to the ground . I dug a hole that would hold a gallon , and whispered it there . ’ While I was with her the flies annoyed her extremely : she drove them away with a fan , and said they seemed to smell her out as one that was going to the grave . She showed me a wound she had received in her elbow by a bayonet . She lamented the error of her former ways , but excused it by saying , ‘ When you are at Rome , you must do as Rome does . ’ When she could not distinctly hear what was said , she raised herself in the bed and thrust her head forward with impatient energy . She said when the king saw her , he called her ‘ a jolly old fellow . ’ Though blind , she could discern a glimmering light , and I was told would frequently state the time of day by the effect of light . ”</p>

   <p>Some time ago a correspondent to the Spectator stated : “ As you are not one to despise ‘ unconsidered trifles ’ when they have merit , perhaps you will find room for the following epitaph , on a Deal Boatman , which I copied the other day from a tombstone in a churchyard in that town :—</p>
   <p>In Memory of GEORGE PHILLPOT , Who died March 22nd , 1850 , aged 74 years . Full many a life he saved With his undaunted crew ; He put his trust in Providence , AND CARED NOT HOW IT BLEW .</p>
   <p>A hero ; his heroic life and deeds , and the philosophy of religion , perfect both in theory and practice , which inspired them , all described in four lines of graphic and spirited verse ! Would not ‘ rare Ben ’ himself have acknowledged this a good specimen of ‘ what verse can say in a little ? ’ Whoever wrote it was a poet ‘ with the name . ’ ”</p>
   <p>“ There is another in the same churchyard , which though weak after the above , and indeed not uncommon , I fancy , in seaside towns , is at least sufficiently quaint :—</p>
   <p>In Memory of JAMES EPPS BUTTRESS , who , in rendering assistance to the French Schooner , “ Vesuvienne , ” was drowned , December 27th , 1852 , aged 39 .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Though Boreas ’ blast and Neptune 's wave</l>
     <l n="2">Did toss me to and fro ,</l>

    </lg>

   <p>The ‘ human race ’ typified by ‘ our fleet , ’ excites vague reminiscences of Goethe and Carlyle , and ‘ our Admiral Christ ’ seems not remotely associated in sentiment with the ‘ We fight that fight for our fair father Christ , ’ and ‘ The King will follow Christ and we the King , ’ of our grand poet . So do the highest and the lowest meet . But the heartiness , the vitality , nay , almost vivacity , of some of these underground tenantry is surprising . There is more life in some of our dead folk than in many a living crowd . ”</p>

   <p>In memory of GEORGE LAMBERT , late Organist of this Church , which office he held upwards of 40 years , performing its duties with ability and assiduity rarely exceeded , affording delight to the lovers of Sacred Harmony , This Tablet is erected by his Musical and private Friends , aided by the brothers of the Humber and Minerva Lodges of Free Masons of this Town ( being a member of the latter Lodge ) , That they might place on record the high sense they entertained of his personal and professional merit .

   <p>Our next epitaph records the death of a fiddler , who appears to have been so much attached to his wife that upon the day of her death he , too , yielded to the grim tyrant . Of this pair , buried in Flixton churchyard , it may be truly said : ‘ In life united , and in death not parted . ’ The inscription is as follows :—</p>
   <p>To the Memory of JOHN BOOTH , of Flixton , who died 16th March , 1778 , aged 43 years ; on the same day and within a few hours of the death of his wife HANNAH , who was buried with him in the same grave , leaving seven children behind them .</p>

     <l n="13">Knew Ossian 's songs , and many bards of yore ;</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In Memory of SAMUEL BUTLER , A poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage , and then is heard no more . Obt . June 15th 1812 , AEt . 62 .</p>
   <p>Butler 's gifted son , Samuel William , was buried in Ardwick cemetery , Manchester . A gravestone placed to his memory bears the following eloquent inscription by Charles Swain :—</p>
   <p>Here rest the mortal remains of SAMUEL WILLIAM BUTLER , Tragedian . In him the stage lost a highly-gifted and accomplished actor , one whose tongue the noblest creations of the poet found truthful utterance . After long and severe suffering he departed this life the 17th day of July , in the year of our Lord 1845 . Aged 41 years .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Whence this ambition , whence this proud desire ,</l>
     <l n="2">This love of fame , this longing to aspire ?</l>
     <l n="3">To gather laurels in their greenest bloom ,</l>
     <l n="4">To honour life and sanctify the tomb ?</l>
     <l n="5">‘ Tis the Divinity that never dies ,</l>
     <l n="6">Which prompts the soul of genius still to rise .</l>
     <l n="7">Though fade the Laurel , leaf by leaf away ,</l>
     <l n="8">The soul hath prescience of a fadeless day ;</l>
     <l n="9">And God 's eternal promise , like a star ,</l>
     <l n="10">From faded hopes still points to hopes afar ;</l>
     <l n="11">Where weary hearts for consolation trust ,</l>
     <l n="12">And bliss immortal quickens from the dust .</l>
     <l n="13">On this great hope , the painter , actor , bard ,</l>
     <l n="14">And all who ever strove for Fame 's reward ,</l>
     <l n="15">Must rest at last ; and all that earth have trod</l>
     <l n="16">Still need the grace of a forgiving God !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>A very interesting sketch of the life of Butler , from the pen of John Evans , is given in the “ Papers of the Manchester Literary Club ” vol . iii , published 1877 .</p>
   <p>In many collections of epitaphs the following is stated to be inscribed on a gravestone at Gillingham , but we are informed by the Vicar that no such epitaph is to be found , nor is there any trace of it having been placed there at any time :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Sacred</l>
     <l n="2">To the Memory of</l>
     <l n="3">THOMAS JACKSON , Comedian ,</l>
     <l n="4">Who was engaged 21st of December , 1741 , to play a comic cast of</l>
     <l n="5">characters , in this great theatre — the world ; for many of which</l>
     <l n="6">he was prompted by nature to excel .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The season being ended , his benefit over , the charges all paid , and his account closed , he made his exit in the tragedy of Death , on the 17th of March , 1798 , in full assurance of being called once more to rehearsal ; where he hopes to find his forfeits all cleared , his cast of parts bettered , and his situation made agreeable , by Him who paid the great stock-debt , for the love He bore to performers in general .</p>
   <p>The following epitaph was written by Swift on Dicky Pearce , who died 1728 , aged 63 years . He was a famous fool , and his name carries us back to the time when kings and noblemen employed jesters for the delectation of themselves and their friends . It is from Beckley , and reads as follows :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Here lies the Earl of Suffolk 's Fool ,</l>
     <l n="2">Men call him DICKY PEARCE ;</l>
     <l n="3">His folly serv 'd to make men laugh ,</l>
     <l n="4">When wit and mirth were scarce .</l>
     <l n="5">Poor Dick , alas ! is dead and gone ,</l>
     <l n="6">What signifies to cry ?</l>
     <l n="7">Dickys enough are still behind</l>
     <l n="8">To laugh at by and by .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In our “ Historic Romance , ” published 1883 , by Hamilton , Adams , and Co ., London , will be found an account of “ Fools and Jesters of the English Sovereigns , ” and we therein state that the last recorded instance of a fool being kept by an English family , is that of John Hilton 's Fool , retained at Hilton Castle , Durham , who died in 1746 .</p>
   <p>The following epitaph is inscribed on a tombstone in the churchyard of St. Mary Friars , Shrewsbury , on Cadman , a famous “ flyer ” on the rope , immortalised by Hogarth , and who broke his neck descending from a steeple in Shrewsbury , in 1740 :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Let this small monument record the name</l>

   <p>Joe Miller , of facetious memory , next claims our attention . We find it stated in Chambers 's “ Book of Days ” ( issued 1869 ) , as follows : Miller was interred in the burial-ground of the parish of St. Clement Danes , in Portugal Street , where a tombstone was erected to his memory . About ten years ago , that burial-ground , by the removal of the mortuary remains , and the demolition of the monuments , was converted into a site for King 's College Hospital . Whilst this not unnecessary , yet undesirable , desecration was in progress , the writer saw Joe 's tombstone lying on the ground ; and being told that it would be broken up and used as materials for the new building , he took an exact copy of the inscription , which was as follows :</p>
   <p>Here lye the Remains of Honest JO : MILLER , who was a tender Husband , a sincere Friend , a facetious Companion , and an excellent Comedian . He departed this Life the 15th day of August 1738 , aged 54 years .</p>

     <l n="1">If humour , wit , and honesty could save</l>
     <l n="2">The humourous , witty , honest , from the grave ,</l>
     <l n="3">The grave had not so soon this tenant found ,</l>
     <l n="4">Whom honesty , and wit , and humour , crowned ;</l>
     <l n="5">Could but esteem , and love preserve our breath ,</l>
     <l n="6">And guard us longer from the stroke of Death ,</l>
     <l n="7">The stroke of Death on him had later fell ,</l>
     <l n="8">Whom all mankind esteemed and loved so well .</l>

   </figure>
   <p>An interesting sketch of the life of JOE MILLER will be found in the “ Book of Days , ” vol . II ., page 216 , and in the same informing and entertaining work , the following notes are given respecting the writer of the foregoing epitaph : “ The ‘ S. DUCK , ’ whose name figures as author of the verses on MILLER 'S tombstone , and who is alluded to on the same tablet , by Mr. Churchwarden Buck , as an instance of ‘ poetic talent in humble life , ’ deserves a short notice . He was a thresher in the service of a farmer near Kew , in Surrey . Imbued with an eager desire for learning , he , under most adverse circumstances , managed to obtain a few books , and educate himself to a limited degree . Becoming known as a rustic rhymer , he attracted the attention of Caroline , queen of George II ., who , with her accustomed liberality , settled on him a pension of L30 per annum ; she made him a Yeoman of the Guard , and installed him as keeper of a kind of museum she had in Richmond Park , called Merlin 's Cave . Not content with these promotions , the generous , but perhaps inconsiderate queen , caused Duck to be admitted to holy orders , and preferred to the living of Byfleet , in Surrey , where he became a popular preacher among the lower classes , chiefly through the novelty of being the ‘ Thresher Parson . ’ This gave Swift occasion to write the following quibbling epigram :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The thresher Duck could o'er the queen prevail ;</l>
     <l n="2">The proverb says ,— ‘ No fence against a flail . ’</l>
     <l n="3">From threshing corn , he turns to thresh his brains ,</l>
     <l n="4">For which her Majesty allows him grains ;</l>
     <l n="5">Though ‘ tis confest , that those who ever saw</l>
     <l n="6">His poems , think ‘ em all not worth a straw .</l>
     <l n="7">Thrice happy Duck ! employed in threshing stubble !</l>
     <l n="8">Thy toil is lessened , and thy profits double .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ One would suppose the poor thresher to have been beneath Swift 's notice , but the provocation was great , and the chastisement , such as it was , merited . For though few men had ever less pretensions to poetical genius than Duck , yet the Court party actually set him up as a rival — nay , as superior — to Pope . And the saddest part of the affair was that Duck , in his utter simplicity and ignorance of what really constituted poetry , was led to fancy himself the greatest poet of the age . Consequently , considering that his genius was neglected , and that he was not rewarded according to his poetical deserts by being made the clergyman of an obscure village , he fell into a state of melancholy , which ended in suicide ; affording another to the numerous instances of the very great difficulty of doing good . If the well-meaning queen had elevated Duck to the position of farm-bailiff , he might have led a long and happy life , amongst the scenes and the classes of society in which his youth had passed , and thus been spared the pangs of disappointed vanity and misdirected ambition . ”</p>
   <p>Says a thoughtful writer , if truth , perspicuity , wit , gravity , and every property pertaining to the ancient or modern epitaph , were ever united in one of terse brevity , it was that made for Burbage , the tragedian , in the days of Shakespeare :—</p>
   <p>“ Exit BURBAGE . ”</p>
   <p>Jerrold , perhaps , with that brevity , which is the soul of wit , trumped the above by his anticipatory epitaph on that excellent man and distinguished historian , Charles Knight :—</p>
   <p>“ Good KNIGHT . ”</p>

    <head>We have under this heading some curious graveyard gleanings on remarkable men and women . Our first is from a tombstone erected in the churchyard of Spofforth , at the cost of Lord Dundas , telling the remarkable career of John Metcalf , better known as “ Blind Jack of Knaresborough ":—</head>

     <l n="17">He died on the 26th of April , 1801 , in the 93rd year of his age .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>A few jottings respecting Metcalf , will probably be read with interest . At the age of six years he lost his sight by an attack of small-pox . Three years later he joined the boys in their bird-nesting exploits , and climbed trees to share the plunder . When he had reached thirteen summers he was taught music , and soon became a proficient performer ; he also learned to ride and swim , and was passionately fond of field-sports . At the age of manhood it is said his mind possessed a self-dependence rarely enjoyed by those who have the perfect use of their faculties ; his body was well in harmony with his mind , for when twenty-one years of age he was six feet one and a-half inches in height , strong and robust in proportion . At the age of twenty-five , he was engaged as a musician at Harrogate . About this time he was frequently employed during the dark nights as a guide over the moors and wilds , then abundant in the neighbourhood of Knaresborough . He was a lover of horse-racing , and often rode his own animals . His horses he so tamed that when he called them by their respective names they came to him , thus enabling him to find his own amongst any number and without trouble . Particulars of the marriage of this individual read like a romance . A Miss Benson , daughter of an innkeeper , reciprocated the affections of our hero ; however , the suitor did not please the parents of the “ fair lady , ” and they selected a Mr. Dickinson as her future husband . Metcalf , hearing that the object of his affection was to be married the following day to the young man selected by her father , hastened to free her by inducing the damsel to elope with him . Next day they were made man and wife , to the great surprise of all who knew them , and to the disappointment of the intended son-in-law . To all it was a matter of wonder how a handsome woman as any in the country , the pride of the place , could link her future with ‘ Blind Jack , ’ and , for his sake , reject the many good offers made her . But the bride set the matter at rest by declaring : “ His actions are so singular , and his spirit so manly and enterprising , that I could not help it . ”</p>
   <p>It is worthy of note that he was the first to set up , for the public accommodation of visitors to Harrogate , a four-wheeled chaise and a one-horse chair ; these he kept for two seasons . He next bought horses and went to the coast for fish , which he conveyed to Leeds and Manchester . In 1745 , when the rebellion broke out in Scotland , he joined a regiment of volunteers raised by Colonel Thornton , a patriotic gentleman , for the defence of the House of Hanover . Metcalf shared with his comrades all the dangers of the campaign . He was defeated at Falkirk , and victorious at Culloden . He was the first to set up ( in 1754 ) a stage-waggon between York and Knaresborough , which he conducted himself twice a week in summer , and once a week in winter . This employment he followed until he commenced contracting for road-making . His first contract was for making three miles of road between Minskip and Ferrensby . He afterwards erected bridges and houses , and made hundreds of miles of roads in Yorkshire , Lancashire , Cheshire , and Derbyshire . He was a dealer in timber and hay , of which he measured and calculated the solid contents by a peculiar method of his own . The hay he always measured with his arms , and , having learned the height , he could tell the number of square yards in the stack . When he went out , he always carried with him a stout staff some inches taller than himself , which was of great service both in his travels and measurements . In 1778 he lost his wife , after thirty-nine years of conjugal felicity , in the sixty-first year of her age . She was interred at Stockport . Four years later he left Lancashire , and settled at the pleasant rural village of Spofforth , not far distant from the town of his nativity . With a daughter , he resided on a small farm until he died , in 1801 . At the time of his decease , his descendants were four children , twenty grandchildren , and ninety great-grandchildren .</p>
   <note>In one of our articles in Chambers 's Journal we furnished the foregoing sketch , and it has since been reproduced in many newspapers and in several volumes .</note>
   <p>In “ Yorkshire Longevity , ” compiled by Mr. William Grainge , of Harrogate , a most painstaking writer on local history , will be found an interesting account of Henry Jenkins , a celebrated Yorkshireman . It is stated : “ In the year 1743 , a monument was erected , by subscription , in Bolton churchyard , to the memory of Jenkins ; it consists of a square base of freestone , four feet four inches on each side , by four feet six inches in height , surmounted by a pyramid eleven feet high . On the east side is inscribed :—</p>
   <p>This monument was erected by contribution , in ye year 1743 , to ye memory of HENRY JENKINS .</p>
   <p>On the west side :—</p>
   <p>HENRY JENKINS , Aged 169 .</p>
   <p>In the church , on a mural tablet of black marble , is inscribed the following epitaph , composed by Dr. Thomas Chapman , Master of Magdalen College , Cambridge :—</p>
   <p>Blush not , marble , to rescue from oblivion the memory of HENRY JENKINS : a person obscure in birth , but of a life truly memorable ; for he was enriched with the goods of nature , if not of fortune , and happy in the duration , if not variety , of his enjoyments : and , tho ’ the partial world despised and disregarded his low and humble state , the equal eye of Providence beheld , and blessed it with a patriarch 's health and length of days : to teach mistaken man , these blessings were entailed on temperance , or , a life of labour and a mind at ease . He lived to the amazing age of 169 ; was interred here , Dec. 6 , ( or 9 ,) 1670 , and had this justice done to his memory 1743 .</p>
   <p>This inscription is a proof that learned men , and masters of colleges , are not always exempt from the infirmity of writing nonsense . Passing over the modest request to the black marble not to blush , because it may feel itself degraded by bearing the name of the plebeian Jenkins , when it ought only to have been appropriated to kings and nobles , we find but questionable philosophy in this inappropriate composition .</p>
   <p>The multitude of great events which took place during the lifetime of this man are truly wonderful and astonishing . He lived under the rule of nine sovereigns of England — Henry VII . ; Henry VIII . ; Edward VI . ; Mary ; Elizabeth ; James I .; Charles I .; Oliver Cromwell ; and Charles II . He was born when the Roman Catholic religion was established by law . He saw the dissolution of the monasteries , and the faith of the nation changed — Popery established a second time by Queen Mary — Protestantism restored by Elizabeth — the Civil War between Charles and the Parliament begun and ended — Monarchy abolished — the young Republic of England , arbiter of the destinies of Europe — and the restoration of Monarchy under the libertine Charles II . During his time , England was invaded by the Scots ; a Scottish King was slain , and a Scottish Queen beheaded in England ; a King of Spain and a King of Scotland were Kings in England ; three Queens and one King were beheaded in England in his days ; and fire and plague alike desolated London . His lifetime appears like that of a nation , more than an individual , so long was it extended and so crowded was it with such great events . ”</p>
   <p>The foregoing many incidents remind us of the well-known Scottish epitaph on Marjory Scott , who died February 26th , 1728 , at Dunkeld , at the extreme age of one hundred years . According to Chambers 's “ Domestic Annals of Scotland , ” the following epitaph was composed for her by Alexander Pennecuik , but never inscribed , and it has been preserved by the reverend statist of the parish , as a whimsical statement of historical facts comprehended within the life of an individual :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Stop , passenger , until my life you read ,</l>
     <l n="2">The living may get knowledge from the dead .</l>
     <l n="3">Five times five years I led a virgin life ,</l>
     <l n="4">Five times five years I was a virtuous wife ;</l>
     <l n="5">Ten times five years I lived a widow chaste ,</l>
     <l n="6">Now tired of this mortal life I rest .</l>
     <l n="7">Betwixt my cradle and my grave hath been</l>
     <l n="8">Eight mighty kings of Scotland and a queen .</l>
     <l n="9">Full twice five years the Commonwealth I saw .</l>
     <l n="10">Ten times the subjects rise against the law ;</l>
     <l n="11">And , which is worse than any civil war ,</l>
     <l n="12">A king arraigned before the subject 's bar .</l>
     <l n="13">Swarms of sectarians , hot with hellish rage ,</l>
     <l n="14">Cut off his royal head upon the stage .</l>
     <l n="15">Twice did I see old prelacy pulled down ,</l>
     <l n="16">And twice the cloak did sink beneath the gown .</l>
     <l n="17">I saw the Stuart race thrust out ; nay , more ,</l>
     <l n="18">I saw our country sold for English ore ;</l>
     <l n="19">Our numerous nobles , who have famous been ,</l>
     <l n="20">Sunk to the lowly number of sixteen .</l>
     <l n="21">Such desolation in my days have been ,</l>
     <l n="22">I have an end of all perfection seen !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>A foot-note states : “ The minister 's version is here corrected from one of the Gentleman 's Magazines for January 1733 ; but both are incorrect , there having been during 1728 and the one hundred preceding years no more than six kings of Scotland . ”</p>
   <p>In Scott 's “ Tales of a Grandfather , ” there is an account of the Battle of Lillyard 's Edge , which was fought in 1545 . The spot on which the battle occurred is so called from an Amazonian Scottish woman , who is reported , by tradition , to have distinguished herself in the fight . An inscription which was placed on her tombstone was legible within the present century , and is said to have run thus :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Fair Maiden Lillyard lies under this stane ,</l>
     <l n="2">Little was her stature , but great was her fame ;</l>
     <l n="3">Upon the English louns she laid many thumps ,</l>
     <l n="4">And when her legs were cutted off , she fought upon her stumps .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The tradition says that a beautiful young lady , called Lillyard , followed her lover from the little village of Maxton , and when she saw him fall in battle , rushed herself into the heat of the fight , and was killed , after slaying several of the English .</p>
   <p>On one of the buttresses on the south side of St. Mary 's Church , at Beverley , is an oval tablet , to commemorate the fate of two Danish soldiers , who , during their voyage to Hull , to join the service of the Prince of Orange , in 1689 , quarrelled , and having been marched with the troops to Beverley , during their short stay there sought a private meeting to settle their differences by the sword . Their melancholy end is recorded in a doggerel epitaph , of which we give an illustration .</p>
   <p>In the parish registers the following entries occur :—</p>
   <p>1689 , December 16 .— Daniel Straker , a Danish trooper buried . " December 23 .— Johannes Frederick Bellow , a Danish trooper , beheaded for killing the other , buried .</p>
   <p>In a note from the Rev . Jno . Pickford , M. A ., we are told : “ The mode of execution was , it may be presumed , by a broad two-handed sword , such a one as Sir Walter Scott has particularly described in “ Anne of Geierstein , ” as used at the decapitation of Sir Archibald de Hagenbach , “ and which the executioner is described as wielding with such address and skill . The Danish culprit was , like the oppressive knight , probably bound and seated in a chair ; but such swords as those depicted on the tablet could not well have been used for the purpose , for they are long , narrow in the blade , and perfectly straight . ”</p>

    <p>TABLET AT ST. MARY 'S CHURCH , BEVERLEY .</p>
   </figure>
   <p>We have in the “ Diary of Abraham de la Pryme , ” the Yorkshire Antiquary , some very interesting particulars respecting the Danes . Writing in 1689 , the diarist tells us : “ Towards the latter end of the aforegoing year , there landed at Hull about six or seven thousand Danes , all stout fine men , the best equip 'd and disciplin 'd of any that was ever seen . They were mighty godly and religious . You would seldom or never hear an oath or ugly word come out of their mouths . They had a great many ministers amongst them , whome they call 'd pastours , and every Sunday almost , ith ’ afternoon , they prayed and preach 'd as soon as our prayers was done . They sung almost all their divine service , and every ministre had those that made up a quire whom the rest follow 'd . Then there was a sermon of about half-an-houre 's length , all memoratim , and then the congregation broke up . When they adminstered the sacrament , the ministre goes into the church and caused notice to be given thereof , then all come before , and he examined them one by one whether they were worthy to receive or no . If they were he admitted them , if they were not he writ their names down in a book , and bid them prepare against the next Sunday . Instead of bread in the sacrament , I observed that they used wafers about the bigness and thickness of a sixpence . They held it no sin to play at cards upon Sundays , and commonly did everywhere where they were suffered ; for indeed in many places the people would not abide the same , but took the cards from them . Tho ’ they loved strong drink , yet all the while I was amongst them , which was all this winter , I never saw above five or six of them drunk . ”</p>
   <p>The diarist tells us that the strangers liked this country . It appears they worked for the farmers , and sold tumblers , cups , spoons , &amp; c ., which they had imported , to the English . They acted in the courthouse a play in their own language , and realised a good sum of money by their performances . The design of the piece was “ Herod 's Tyranny — The Birth of Christ — The Coming of the Wise Men . ”</p>
   <p>In Bolton churchyard , Lancashire , is a gravestone of considerable historical interest . It has been incorrectly printed in several books and magazines , but we are able to give a literal copy drawn from a carefully compiled “ History of Bolton , ” by John D. Briscoe :—</p>
   <p>JOHN OKEY ,</p>
   <p>The servant of God , was borne in London , 1608 , came into this toune in 1629 , married Mary , daughter of James Crompton , of Breightmet , 1635 , with whom he lived comfortably 20 yeares , &amp; begot 4 sons and 6 daughters . Since then he lived sole till the da of his death . In his time were many great changes , &amp; terrible alterations — 18 yeares Civil Wars in England , besides many dreadful sea fights — the crown or command of England changed 8 times , Episcopacy laid aside 14 yeares ; London burnt by Papists , &amp; more stately built againe ; Germany wasted 300 miles ; 200 , 000 protestants murdered in Ireland , by the papists ; this toune thrice stormed — once taken , &amp; plundered . He went throw many troubles and divers conditions , found rest , joy , &amp; happines only in holines — the faith , feare , and loue of God in Jesus Christ . He died the 29 of Ap and lieth here buried , 1684 . Come Lord Jesus , o come quickly . Holiness is man 's happines .</p>

    <head>[ THE ARMS OF OKEY . ]</head>
    <head>We gather from Mr. Briscoe 's history that Okey was a woolcomber , and came from London , to superintend some works at Bolton , where he married the niece of the proprietor , and died in affluence .</head>
     <l n="1">Bradley , the “ Yorkshire Giant , ” was buried in the Market Weighton church ,</l>
     <l n="2">and on a marble monument the following inscription appears :—</l>

   <p>In “ Celebrities of the Yorkshire Wolds , ” by Frederick Ross , an interesting sketch of Bradley is given . Mr Ross states that he was a man of temperate habits , and never drank anything stronger than water , milk , or tea , and was a very moderate eater .</p>
   <p>In Hampsthwaite churchyard was interred a “ Yorkshire Dwarf . ” Her gravestone states :—</p>
   <p>In memory of JANE RIDSDALE , daughter of George and Isabella Ridsdale , of Hampsthwaite , who died at Swinton Hall , in the parish of Masham , on the 2nd day of January , 1828 , in the 59th year of her age . Being in stature only 31-1 / 2 inches high .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In remembrance of that prodigy in nature , DANIEL LAMBERT , a native of Leicester , who was possessed of an excellent and convivial mind , and in personal greatness had no competitor . He measured three feet one inch round the leg , nine feet four inches round the body , and weighed 52 stones 11lbs . ( 14lb . to the stone ) . He departed this life on the 21st of June , 1809 , aged 39 years . As a testimony of respect , this stone was erected by his friends in Leicester .</p>
   <p>Respecting the burial of Lambert we gather from a sketch of his life the following particulars : “ His coffin , in which there was a great difficulty to place him , was six feet four inches long , four feet four inches wide , and two feet four inches deep ; the immense substance of his legs made it necessarily a square case . This coffin , which consisted of 112 superficial feet of elm , was built on two axle-trees , and four cog-wheels . Upon these his remains were rolled into his grave , which was in the new burial ground at the back of St. Martin 's Church . A regular descent was made by sloping it for some distance . It was found necessary to take down the window and wall of the room in which he lay to allow of his being taken away . ”</p>

   <p>The next epitaph is from St. James 's cemetery , Liverpool :—</p>
   <p>Reader pause . Deposited beneath are the remains of SARAH BIFFIN ,</p>
   <p>who was born without arms or hands , at Quantox Head , County of Somerset , 25th of October , 1784 , died at Liverpool , 2nd October , 1850 . Few have passed through the vale of life so much the child of hapless fortune as the deceased : and yet possessor of mental endowments of no ordinary kind . Gifted with singular talents as an Artist , thousands have been gratified with the able productions of her pencil ! whilst versatile conversation and agreeable manners elicited the admiration of all . This tribute to one so universally admired is paid by those who were best acquainted with the character it so briefly portrays . Do any inquire otherwise — the answer is supplied in the solemn admonition of the Apostle —</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Our correspondent , Mrs. Charlotte Jobling , from whom we received the above , says : “ The remainder is buried . It stands against the wall , and does not appear to now mark the grave of Miss Biffin . ” Mr. Henry Morley , in his carefully prepared and entertaining “ Memoirs of Bartholomew Fair , ” writing about the fair of 1799 , mentions Miss Biffin . “ She was found , ” says Mr. Morley , “ in the Fair , and assisted by the Earl of Morton , who sat for his likeness to her , always taking the unfinished picture away with him when he left , that he might prove it to be all the work of her own shoulder . When it was done he laid it before George III ., in the year 1808 ; obtained the King 's favour for Miss Biffin ; and caused her to receive , at his own expense , further instruction in her art from Mr. Craig . For the last twelve years of his life he maintained a correspondence with her ; and , after having enjoyed favour from two King Georges , she received from William IV . a small pension , with which , at the Earl 's request , she retired from a life among caravans . But fourteen years later , having been married in the interval , she found it necessary to resume , as Mrs. Wright , late Miss Biffin , her business as a skilful miniature painter , in one or two of our chief provincial towns . ”</p>
   <p>The following on Butler , the author of “ Hudibras , ” merits a place in our pages . The first inscription is from St. Paul 's , Covent Garden :—</p>
   <p>BUTLER , the celebrated author of “ Hudibras , ” was buried in this church . Some of the inhabitants , understanding that so famous a man was there buried , and regretting that neither stone nor inscription recorded the event , raised a subscription for the purpose of erecting something to his memory . Accordingly , an elegant tablet has been put up in the portico of the church , bearing a medallion of that great man , which was taken from his monument in Westminster Abbey .</p>
   <p>The following lines were contributed by Mr. O'Brien , and are engraved beneath the medallion :—</p>

   <p>Who was born at Strensham , in Worcestershire , 1612 , and died at London , 1680 ; a man of uncommon learning , wit , and probity : as admirable for the product of his genius , as unhappy in the rewards of them . His satire , exposing the hypocrisy and wickedness of the rebels , is such an inimitable piece , that , as he was the first , he may be said to be the last writer in his peculiar manner . That he , who , when living , wanted almost everything , might not , after death , any longer want so much as a tomb , John Barber , citizen of London , erected this monument 1721 .</p>
   <p>Here are a few particulars respecting an oddity , furnished by a correspondent : “ Died , at High Wycombe , Bucks , on the 24th May , 1837 , Mr. John Guy , aged 64 . His remains were interred in Hughenden churchyard , near Wycombe . On a marble slab , on the lid of his coffin , is the following inscription :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>This eccentric gentleman was possessed of considerable property , and was a native of Gloucestershire . His grave and coffin were made under his directions more than a twelvemonth before his death ; the inscription on the tablet on his coffin , and the lines placed upon his gravestone , were his own compositions . He gave all necessary orders for the conducting of his funeral , and five shillings were wrapped in separate pieces of paper for each of the bearers . The coffin was of singular beauty and neatness in workmanship , and looked more like a piece of tasteful cabinet work intended for a drawing-room , than a receptable for the dead .</p>
   <p>Near the great door of the Abbey of St. Peter , Gloucester , says Mr. Henry Calvert Appleby , at the bottom of the body of the building , is a marble monument to John Jones , dressed in the robes of an alderman , painted in different colours . Underneath the effigy , on a tablet of black marble , are the following words :—</p>
   <p>JOHN JONES , alderman , thrice mayor of the city , burgess of the Parliament at the time of the gunpowder treason ; registrar to eight several Bishops of this diocese .</p>
   <p>He died in the sixth year of the reign of King Charles , on the first of June , 1630 . He gave orders for his monument to be raised in his lifetime . When the workmen had fixed it up , he found fault with it , remarking that the nose was too red . While they were altering it , he walked up and down the body of the church . He then said that he had himself almost finished , so he paid off the men , and died the next morning .</p>

   <p>This singular epitaph points out the last resting place of Henry Marten , one of the judges who condemned King Charles I. to the scaffold . On the Restoration , Marten was sentenced to perpetual imprisonment , Chepstow Castle being selected as the place of his incarceration . There he died in 1680 , in the twenty-eighth year of his captivity , and seventy-eighth of his age . He was originally interred in the chancel of the church ; but a subsequent vicar of Chepstow , Chest by name , who carried his petty party animosities even beyond the grave , had the dead man 's dust removed , averring that he would not allow the body of a regicide to lie so near the altar . And so it was that Marten 's memorial came to occupy its present position in the passage leading from the nave to the north aisle . We are told that one , Mr. Downton , a son-in-law of this pusillanimous parson , touched to the quick by his relative 's harsh treatment of poor Marten 's inanimate remains , retorted by writing this satirical epitaph for the Rev . Mr . Chest 's tombstone :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Here lies at rest , I do protest ,</l>
     <l n="2">One CHEST within another !</l>
     <l n="3">The chest of wood was very good ,—</l>
     <l n="4">Who says so of the other ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Some doubt has been thrown on the probability of a man of Marten 's culture having written , as is implied in the inscription , the epitaph which has a place on his memorial .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The regicide was a son of Sir Henry Marten , a favourite of the first</l>
     <l n="2">James , and by him appointed Principal Judge of the Admiralty and Dean of</l>
     <l n="3">Arches . Young Henry was himself a prominent person during the period of</l>
     <l n="4">the disastrous Civil War , and was elected Member of Parliament for</l>
     <l n="5">Berkshire in 1640 . He was , in politics , a decided Republican , and threw in</l>
     <l n="6">his lot with the Roundhead followers of sturdy Oliver . When the tide of</l>
     <l n="7">popular favour turned in Charles II . ' s direction , and Royalty was</l>
     <l n="8">reinstated , Marten and the rest of the regicides were brought to judgment</l>
     <l n="9">for signing the death warrant of their monarch . The consequence , in</l>
     <l n="10">Marten 's case , was life-long imprisonment , as we have seen , in Chepstow</l>

     <l n="30">In the burial-ground of the Island of Juan Fernandez , a monument states :—</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In Memory of ALEXANDER SELKIRK , Mariner , A native of Largo , in the county of Fife , Scotland , Who lived on this island , in complete solitude , for four years and four months . He was landed from the Cinque Ports galley , 96 tons , 18 guns , A. D. 1704 , and was taken off in the Duke , privateer , 12th February , 1709 . He died Lieutenant of H. M. S . Weymouth , A. D. 1723 , aged 47 years . This Tablet is erected near Selkirk 's look out , By Commodore Powell and the Officers of H. M. S . Topaze , A. D. 1868 .</p>
   <p>It is generally believed that the adventures of Selkirk suggested to Daniel Defoe the attractive story of “ Robinson Crusoe . ” In the “ Dictionary of English Literature , ” by William Davenport Adams , will be found important information bearing on this subject .</p>
   <p>In Gloucester Notes and Queries we read as follows : “ Stout 's Hill is the name of a house situated on high ground to the south of the Village of Uley , built in the style which , in the last century , was intended for Gothic , but which may be more exactly defined as the ‘ Strawberry Hill ’ style . In a house of earlier date lived the father of Samuel Rudder , the laborious compiler of the History of Gloucestershire ( 1779 ) . He lies in the churchyard of Uley , on the south side of the chancel , and his grave-stone has a brass-plate inserted , which records a remarkable fact :—</p>
   <p>Underneath lies the remains of ROGER RUTTER , alias RUDDER , eldest son of John Rutter , of Uley , who was buried August 30 , 1771 , aged 84 years , having never eaten flesh , fish , or fowl , during the course of his long life .</p>
   <p>Tradition tells us that this vegetarian lived mainly on ‘ dump , ’ in various forms . Usually he ate ‘ plain dump : ’ when tired of plain dump , he changed his diet to ‘ hard dump ; ’ and when he was in a special state of exhilaration , he added the variety of ‘ apple dump ’ to his very moderate fare . ”</p>
   <p>On the gravestone of Richard Turner , Preston , a hawker of fish , the following inscription appears :—</p>
   <p>Beneath this stone are deposited the remains of RICHARD TURNER , author of the word Teetotal , as applied to abstinence from all intoxicating liquors , who departed this life on the 27th day of October , 1846 , aged 56 years .</p>
   <p>In Mr. W. E. A. Axon 's able and entertaining volume , “ Lancashire Gleanings ” ( pub . 1883 ) , is an interesting chapter on the “ Origin of the Word ‘ Teetotal . ’ ” In the same work we are told that Dr. Whitaker , the historian of Whalley , wrote the following epitaph on a model publican :—</p>
   <p>Here lies the Body of JOHN WIGGLESWORTH , More than fifty years he was the perpetual Innkeeper in this Town . Withstanding the temptations of that dangerous calling , he maintained good order in his House , kept the Sabbath day Holy , frequented the Public Worship with his Family , induced his guests to do the same , and regularly partook of the Holy Communion . He was also bountiful to the Poor , in private as well as in public , and , by the blessings of Providence on a life so spent , died possessed of competent Wealth , Feb. 28 , 1813 , aged 77 years .</p>
   <p>The churchyard of Sutton Coldfield , Warwickshire , contains a gravestone bearing an inscription as follows :—</p>
   <p>As a warning to female virtue , And a humble monument of female chastity , This stone marks the grave of MARY ASHFORD , Who , in the 20th year of her age , having Incautiously repaired to a scene of amusement , Was brutally violated and murdered On the 27th of May , 1817 .</p>

     <l n="5">For though the deed of blood was veiled in night ,</l>
     <l n="6">Will not the Judge of all mankind do right ?</l>
     <l n="7">Fair blighted flower , the muse that weeps thy doom ,</l>
     <l n="8">Rears o'er thy murdered form this warning tomb .</l>

   <p>The writer of the foregoing epitaph was Dr. Booker , vicar of Dudley . The inscription is associated with one of the most remarkable trials of the present century . It will not be without interest to furnish a few notes on the case . One Abraham Thornton was tried at the Warwick assizes for the murder of Mary Ashford , and acquitted . The brother and next of kin of the deceased , not being satisfied with the verdict , sued out , as the law allowed him , an appeal against Thornton , by which he could be put on his trial again . The law allowed the appeal in case of murder , and it also gave option to the accused of having it tried by wager of law or by wager of battle . The brother of the unfortunate woman had taken no account of this , and accordingly , not only Mr. Ashford , but the judge , jury , and bar were taken greatly aback , and stricken with dismay when the accused , being requested to plead , took a paper from Mr . Reader , his counsel , and a pair of gloves , one of which he drew on , and , throwing the other on the ground , exclaimed , “ Not guilty ; and I am ready to defend the same with my body ! ” Lord Ellenborough on the bench appeared grave , and the accuser looked amazed , so the court was adjourned to enable the judge to have an opportunity of conferring with his learned brethren . After several adjournments , Lord Ellenborough at last declared solemnly , but reluctantly , that wager of battle was still the law of the land , and that the accused had a right of appeal to it . To get rid of the law an attempt was made , by passing a short and speedy Act of Parliament , but this was ruled impossible , as it would have been ex post facto , and people wanted curiously to see the lists set up in the Tothill Fields . As Mr. Ashford refused to meet Thornton , he was obliged to cry “ craven ! ” After that the appellor was allowed to go at large , and he could not be again tried by wager of law after having claimed his wager of battle . In 1819 an Act was passed to prevent any further appeals for wager of battle .</p>

     <l n="21">In Welton churchyard , near Hull , the next curious inscription appears on</l>
     <l n="22">an old gravestone :—</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Here lieth He ould JEREMY , who hath eight times maried been , but now in his ould Age , he lies in his cage , under The gras so Green , which JEREMIAH SIMPSON departed this life in the 84 yeare of his age , in the year of our Lord 1719 .</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Potter Briscoe favours us with an account of a famous local character , and a copy of his epitaph . According to Mr. Briscoe , Vincent Eyre was by trade a needle-maker , and was a firm and consistent Tory in politics , taking an active interest in all the party struggles of the period . His good nature and honesty made him popular among the poor classes , with whom he chiefly associated . A commendable trait in his character is worthy of special mention , namely , that , notwithstanding frequent temptations , he spurned to take a bribe from any one . In the year 1727 an election for a Member of Parliament took place , and all the ardour of Vin 's nature was at once aroused in the interests of his favourite party . The Tory candidate , Mr. Borlase Warren , was opposed by Mr. John Plumtree , the Whig nominee , and , in the heat of the excitement , Vin emphatically declared that he should not mind dying immediately if the Tories gained the victory . Strange to relate , such an event actually occurred , for when the contest and the “ chairing ” of the victor was over , he fell down dead with joy , September 6th , 1727 . The epitaph upon him is as follows :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Here lies VIN EYRE ;</l>
     <l n="2">Let fall a tear</l>
     <l n="3">For one true man of honour ;</l>
     <l n="4">No courtly lord ,</l>
     <l n="5">Who breaks his word ,</l>
     <l n="6">Will ever be a mourner .</l>
     <l n="7">In freedom 's cause</l>
     <l n="8">He stretched his jaws ,</l>
     <l n="9">Exhausted all his spirit ,</l>
     <l n="10">Then fell down dead .</l>
     <l n="11">It must be said</l>
     <l n="12">He was a man of merit .</l>
     <l n="13">Let Freemen be</l>
     <l n="14">As brave as he ,</l>
     <l n="15">And vote without a guinea ;</l>
     <l n="16">VIN EYRE is hurled</l>
     <l n="17">To t'other world ,</l>
     <l n="18">And ne'er took bribe or penny .</l>
     <l n="19">True to his friend , to helpless parent kind ,</l>
     <l n="20">He died in honour 's cause , to interest blind .</l>
     <l n="21">Why should we grieve life 's but an airy toy ?</l>
     <l n="22">We vainly weep for him who died of joy .</l>

   <p>We will next give some account of an eccentric Lincolnshire schoolmaster , named William Teanby , who resided for many years at Winterton . Respecting the early years of his career we have not been able to obtain any information . At the age of 30 , he was engaged as a school-master in the vestry of Winterton church . He had many scholars , and continued teaching until he had attained a very advanced age . Some years before his death a gravestone was ordered , whereon he cut in ancient court hand the epitaph of his wife and children . From this slab he mostly took his food , and long before his death , placed on two pieces of wood , it served him for a table . After the epitaph of his wife and children , he left a vacancy for his own name and age , to be inserted by a friend , which was done at his death . The coffin in which he proposed being buried was used by him a considerable time as a cupboard . The old man retained perfect possession of his senses to the last , and at the age of 95 attended the Lincoln assizes , and gave away as curiosities , many circular pieces of paper for watches , not larger than half-a-crown , on which he had written the Lord 's prayer and creed . He was habitually serious . Through attending his school in the church , he became familiar with the house of death ; in feasting from his stone slab , he enjoyed his meals from the very source which was afterwards to record the events of his life ; and in what was his every day cupboard he now enjoys a peaceful and quiet rest . He passed away at the advanced age of 97 . The tombstone bears the following lines :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">To us grim death but sadly harsh appears ,</l>
     <l n="2">Yet all the ill we feel , is in our fears ;</l>
     <l n="3">To die is but to live , upon that shore</l>
     <l n="4">Where billows never beat , nor tempests roar ;</l>
     <l n="5">For ere we feel its probe , the pang is o'er ;</l>
     <l n="6">The wife , by faith , insulting death defies ;</l>
     <l n="7">The poor man resteth in yon azure skies ;—</l>
     <l n="8">That home of ease the guilty ne'er can crave ,</l>
     <l n="9">Nor think to dwell with God , beyond the grave ;—</l>
     <l n="10">It eases lovers , sets the captive free ,</l>
     <l n="11">And though a tyrant he gives liberty .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="12">The following lines also appear on the same stone :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">Death 's silent summons comes unto us all ,</l>
     <l n="14">And makes a universal funeral !—</l>

     <l n="16">Youth too , and its men in years , and weak and strong !</l>
     <l n="17">Spares not the wicked , proud , and insolent ,</l>
     <l n="18">Neither the righteous , just , nor innocent ;</l>
     <l n="19">All living souls , must pass the dismal doom</l>
     <l n="20">Of mournful death , to join the silent tomb .</l>

   <p>The following lines to the memory of Thomas Stokes are from his gravestone in Burton churchyard , upon which a profile of his head is cut . He for many years swept the roads in Burton :—</p>
   <p>This stone was raised by Subscription to the memory of THOMAS STOKES , an eccentric , but much respected , Deaf and Dumb man , better known by the name of “ DUMB TOM , ” who departed this life Feb. 25th , 1837 , aged 54 years .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">What man can pause and charge this senseless dust</l>
     <l n="2">With fraud , or subtilty , or aught unjust ?</l>
     <l n="3">How few can conscientiously declare</l>
     <l n="4">Their acts have been as honourably fair ?</l>
     <l n="5">No gilded bait , no heart ensnaring need</l>
     <l n="6">Could bribe poor STOKES to one dishonest deed .</l>
     <l n="7">Firm in attachment to his friends most true —</l>
     <l n="8">Though Deaf and Dumb , he was excell 'd by few .</l>
     <l n="9">Go ye , by nature form 'd without defect ,</l>
     <l n="10">And copy Tom , and gain as much respect .</l>

   <p>Next we deal with an instance of pure affection . The churchyard of the Yorkshire village of Bowes contains the grave of two lovers , whose touching fate suggested Mallet 's beautiful ballad of “ Edward and Emma . ” The real names of the couple were Rodger Wrightson and Martha Railton . The story is rendered with no less accuracy than pathos by the poet :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Far in the windings of the vale ,</l>
     <l n="2">Fast by a sheltering wood ,</l>
     <l n="3">The safe retreat of health and peace ,</l>
     <l n="4">A humble cottage stood .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">There beauteous Emma nourished fair ,</l>
     <l n="6">Beneath a mother 's eye ;</l>
     <l n="7">Whose only wish on earth was now</l>
     <l n="8">To see her blest and die .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Long had she filled each youth with love ,</l>
     <l n="10">Each maiden with despair ,</l>
     <l n="11">And though by all a wonder owned ,</l>
     <l n="12">Yet knew not she was fair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Till Edwin came , the pride of swains ,</l>
     <l n="14">A soul devoid of art ;</l>
     <l n="15">And from whose eyes , serenely mild ,</l>
     <l n="16">Shone forth the feeling heart .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>We are told that Edwin 's father and sister were bitterly opposed to their love . The poor youth pined away . When he was dying Emma , was permitted to see him , but the cruel sister would scarcely allow her to bid him a word of farewell . Returning home , she heard the passing bell toll for the death of her lover —</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Just then she reached , with trembling step ,</l>
     <l n="2">Her aged mother 's door —</l>
     <l n="3">“ He 's gone ! ” she cried , “ and I shall see</l>
     <l n="4">That angel face no more ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ I feel , I feel this breaking heart</l>
     <l n="6">Beat high against my side ” —</l>
     <l n="7">From her white arm down sunk her head ;</l>
     <l n="8">She , shivering , sighed , and died .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The lovers were buried the same day and in the same grave . In the year 1848 , Dr. F. Dinsdale , F. S. A ., editor of the “ Ballads and Songs of David Mallet , ” etc ., erected a simple but tasteful monument to the memory of the lovers , bearing the following inscription :—</p>
   <p>RODGER WRIGHTSON , junr ., and MARTHA RAILTON , both of Bowes ; buried in one grave . He died in a fever , and upon tolling his passing bell , she cry 'd out My heart is broke , and in a few hours expired , purely thro ’ love , March 15 , 1714-15 . Such is the brief and touching record contained in the parish register of burials . It has been handed down by unvarying tradition that the grave was at the west end of the church , directly beneath the bells . The sad history of these true and faithful lovers forms the subject of Mallet 's pathetic ballad of “ Edwin and Emma . "[ 2 ]</p>

   <p>In St. Peter 's churchyard , Barton-on-Humber , there is a tombstone with the following strange inscription :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Doom 'd to receive half my soul held dear ,</l>
     <l n="2">The other half with grief , she left me here .</l>
     <l n="3">Ask not her name , for she was true and just ;</l>
     <l n="4">Once a fine woman , but now a heap of dust .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>As may be inferred , no name is given ; the date is 1777 . A curious and romantic legend attaches to the epitaph . In the above year an unknown lady of great beauty , who is conjectured to have loved “ not wisely , but too well , ” came to reside in the town . She was accompanied by a gentleman , who left her after making lavish arrangements for her comfort . She was proudly reserved in her manners , frequently took long solitary walks , and studiously avoided all intercourse . In giving birth to a child she died , and did not disclose her name or family connections . After her decease , the gentleman who came with her arrived , and was overwhelmed with grief at the intelligence which awaited him . He took the child away without unravelling the secret , having first ordered the stone to be erected , and delivered into the mason 's hands the verse , which is at once a mystery and a memento . Such are the particulars gathered from “ The Social History and Antiquities of Barton-on-Humber , ” by H. W. Ball , issued in 1856 . Since the publication of Mr. Ball 's book , we have received from him the following notes , which mar somewhat the romantic story as above related . We are informed that the person referred to in the epitaph was the wife of a man named Jonathan Burkitt , who came from the neighbourhood of Grantham . He had been valet de chambre to some gentleman or nobleman , who gave him a large sum of money on his marrying the lady . They came to reside at Barton , where she died in childbirth . Burkitt , after the death of his wife , left the town , taking the infant ( a boy ) , who survived . In about three years he returned , and married a Miss Ostler , daughter of an apothecary at Barton . He there kept the King 's Head , a public-house at that time . The man got through about L2000 between leaving Grantham and marrying his second wife .</p>
   <p>On the north wall of the chancel of Southam Church is a slab to the memory of the Rev . Samuel Sands , who , being embarrassed in consequence of his extensive liberality , committed suicide in his study ( now the hall of the rectory ) . The peculiarity of the inscription , instead of suppressing inquiry , invariably raises curiosity respecting it :—</p>

   <p>In Memory of BRIAN , Son of JOHN and MARTHA HAIGH , who died 22nd December , 1795 , Aged 17 years .</p>

   <p>The old church of St. Mary 's , Sculcoates , Hull , contains several interesting monuments , and we give a sketch of one , a quaint-looking mural memorial , having on it an inscription in short-hand . In Sheahan 's “ History of Hull , ” the following translation is given :—</p>
   <p>In the vault beneath this stone lies the body of Mrs. JANE DELAMOTH , who departed this life , 10th January , 1761 . She was a poor sinner , but not wicked without holiness , departing from good works , and departed in the Faith of the Catholic Church , in full assurance of eternal happiness , by the agony and bloody sweat , by the cross and passion , by the precious death and burial , by the glorious resurrection and ascension of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , Amen .</p>
   <p>We believe that the foregoing is a unique epitaph , at all events we have not heard of or seen any other monumental inscription in short-hand .</p>
   <p>The following curious epitaph is from Wirksworth , Derbyshire :—</p>
   <p>Near this place lies the body of PHILIP SHULLCROSS ,</p>
   <p>Once an eminent Quill-driver to the attorneys in this Town . He died the 17th of Nov. 1787 , aged 67 .</p>
   <p>Viewing Philip in a moral light , the most prominent and remarkable features in his character were his zeal and invincible attachment to dogs and cats , and his unbounded benevolence towards them , as well as towards his fellow-creatures .</p>

     <l n="2">Nor tear his frailties from their dread abode ,</l>

     <l n="4">That much esteem 'd he lived , and much regretted fell .</l>

   <p>At Castleton , in the Peak of Derbyshire , is another curious epitaph , partly in English and partly in Latin , to the memory of an attorney-at-law named Micah Hall , who died in 1804 . It is said to have been penned by himself , and is more epigrammatic than reverent . It is as follows :—</p>

   <p>In Sarnesfield churchyard , near Weobley , is the tombstone of John Abel , the celebrated architect of the market-houses of Hereford , Leominster , Knighton , and Brecknock , who died in the year 1694 , having attained the ripe old age of ninety-seven . The memorial stone is adorned with three statues in kneeling posture , representing Abel and his two wives ; and also displayed are the emblems of his profession — the rule , the compass , and the square — the whole being designed and sculptured by himself . The epitaph , a very quaint one , was also of his own writing , and runs thus :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">This craggy stone a covering is for an architector 's bed ;</l>
     <l n="2">That lofty buildings raised high , yet now lyes low his head ;</l>
     <l n="3">His line and rule , so death concludes , are locked up in store ;</l>
     <l n="4">Build they who list , or they who wist , for he can build no more .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>His house of clay could hold no longer , May Heaven 's joy build him a stronger . JOHN ABEL . Vive ut vivas in vitam aeternam .</p>
   <p>The following inscription copied from a monument at Darfield , near Barnsley , records a murder which occurred on the spot where the stone is placed :—</p>
   <p>Sacred To the Memory of THOMAS DEPLEDGE , Who was murdered at Darfield , On the 11th of October , 1841 .</p>

    <p>WORKS BY WILLIAM ANDREWS , F. R. H. S . HISTORIC ROMANCE . Strange Stories , Characters , Scenes , Mysteries , and Memorable Events in the History of Old England . In his present work Mr. Andrews has traversed a wider field than in his last book “ Historic Yorkshire , ” but it is marked by the same painstaking care for accuracy , and also by the pleasant way in which he popularises strange stories and out-of-the-way scenes in English history . There is much to amuse in this volume as well as to instruct , and it is enriched with a copious index .— Notes and Queries . A fascinating work .— Whitehall Review . Mr. Andrews discourses about Ordeals , Forest Life and Laws , Guilds , Pledging in the Days of Yore , Skull Superstitions , Cure by Royal Touch , Fools and Jesters , Death Omens , and kindred topics in over a score of chapters , every one of which is as enthralling as a well-written novel . But Mr. Andrews ’ pages are instructive as well as entertaining , and he seems to have spared no pains to gather for us , from out-of-the-way corners and unknown sources , all kinds of much desired and welcome information .— Newcastle Courant . Free by Parcels Post for Five Shillings . HISTORIC YORKSHIRE . Cuthbert Bede , the popular author of “ Verdant Green , ” writing to Society , says : “ Historic Yorkshire , ” by William Andrews , will be of great interest and value to everyone connected with England 's largest county . Mr. Andrews not only writes with due enthusiasm for his subject , but has arranged and marshalled his facts and figures with great skill , and produced a thoroughly popular work that will be read eagerly and with advantage . This handsomely-bound , luxuriously-printed , and gilt-edged volume would , indeed , form a very appropriate school-gift , as well as a book to be placed on the library shelf of the student . A clear and copious index increases the value of a work that will be read with interest by the historian , the folk-lorist , the antiquary , and the lover of legendary lore .
