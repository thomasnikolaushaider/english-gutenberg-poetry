    <p>TO THE ELECT OF LOVE ,— OR SIDE-BY-SIDE IN RAPTEST ECSTASY , OR SUNDERED WIDE BY SEAS THAT BEAR NO MESSAGE TO OR FRO BETWEEN THE LOVED AND LOST OF LONG AGO . So were I but a minstrel , deft At weaving , with the trembling strings Of my glad harp , the warp and weft Of rondels such as rapture sings ,— I 'd loop my lyre across my breast , Nor stay me till my knee found rest In midnight banks of bud and flower Beneath my lady 's lattice-bower . And there , drenched with the teary dews , I 'd woo her with such wondrous art As well might stanch the songs that ooze Out of the mockbird 's breaking heart ; So light , so tender , and so sweet Should be the words I would repeat , Her casement , on my gradual sight , Would blossom as a lily might .</p>

    <head>AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">As one who cons at evening o'er an album all alone ,</l>
     <l n="2">And muses on the faces of the friends that he has known ,</l>
     <l n="3">So I turn the leaves of fancy till , in shadowy design ,</l>
     <l n="4">I find the smiling features of an old sweetheart of mine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The lamplight seems to glimmer with a flicker of surprise ,</l>
     <l n="6">As I turn it low to rest me of the dazzle in my eyes ,</l>
     <l n="7">And light my pipe in silence , save a sigh that seems to yoke</l>
     <l n="8">Its fate with my tobacco and to vanish with the smoke .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Tis a fragrant retrospection — for the loving thoughts that start</l>
     <l n="10">Into being are like perfume from the blossom of the heart ;</l>
     <l n="11">And to dream the old dreams over is a luxury divine —</l>
     <l n="12">When my truant fancy wanders with that old sweetheart of mine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Though I hear , beneath my study , like a fluttering of wings ,</l>
     <l n="14">The voices of my children , and the mother as she sings ,</l>
     <l n="15">I feel no twinge of conscience to deny me any theme</l>
     <l n="16">When Care has cast her anchor in the harbor of a dream .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">[ Illustration ]</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="18">In fact , to speak in earnest , I believe it adds a charm</l>
     <l n="19">To spice the good a trifle with a little dust of harm —</l>
     <l n="20">For I find an extra flavor in Memory 's mellow wine</l>
     <l n="21">That makes me drink the deeper to that old sweetheart of mine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="22">A face of lily-beauty , with a form of airy grace .</l>
     <l n="23">Floats out of my tobacco as the genii from the vase ;</l>
     <l n="24">And I thrill beneath the glances of a pair of azure eyes</l>
     <l n="25">As glowing as the summer and as tender as the skies .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="26">I can see the pink sunbonnet and the little checkered dress</l>
     <l n="27">She wore when first I kissed her and she answered the caress</l>
     <l n="28">With the written declaration that , “ as surely as the vine</l>
     <l n="29">Grew round the stump , ” she loved me — that old sweetheart of mine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="30">And again I feel the pressure of her slender little hand ,</l>
     <l n="31">As we used to talk together of the future we had planned —</l>
     <l n="32">When I should be a poet , and with nothing else to do</l>
     <l n="33">But write the tender verses that she set the music to :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="34">When we should live together in a cozy little cot</l>
     <l n="35">Hid in a nest of roses , with a fairy garden-spot ,</l>
     <l n="36">Where the vines were ever fruited , and the weather ever fine ,</l>
     <l n="37">And the birds were ever singing for that old sweetheart of mine :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="38">When I should be her lover forever and a day ,</l>
     <l n="39">And she my faithful sweetheart till the golden hair was gray ;</l>
     <l n="40">And we should be so happy that when either 's lips were dumb</l>
     <l n="41">They would not smile in Heaven till the other 's kiss had come .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">How tired I am ! I sink down all alone</l>
     <l n="2">Here by the wayside of the Present . Lo ,</l>
     <l n="3">Even as a child I hide my face and moan —</l>
     <l n="4">A little girl that may no farther go ;</l>
     <l n="5">The path above me only seems to grow</l>
     <l n="6">More rugged , climbing still , and ever briered</l>
     <l n="7">With keener thorns of pain than these below ;</l>
     <l n="8">And O the bleeding feet that falter so</l>
     <l n="9">And are so very tired !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">Why , I have journeyed from the far-off Lands</l>
     <l n="11">Of Babyhood — where baby-lilies blew</l>
     <l n="12">Their trumpets in mine ears , and filled my hands</l>
     <l n="13">With treasures of perfume and honey-dew ,</l>
     <l n="14">And where the orchard shadows ever drew</l>
     <l n="15">Their cool arms round me when my cheeks were fired</l>
     <l n="16">With too much joy , and lulled mine eyelids to ,</l>
     <l n="17">And only let the starshine trickle through</l>
     <l n="18">In sprays , when I was tired !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">Yet I remember , when the butterfly</l>
     <l n="20">Went flickering about me like a flame</l>
     <l n="21">That quenched itself in roses suddenly ,</l>
     <l n="22">How oft I wished that I might blaze the same ,</l>
     <l n="23">And in some rose-wreath nestle with my name ,</l>
     <l n="24">While all the world looked on it and admired .—</l>
     <l n="25">Poor moth !— Along my wavering flight toward fame</l>
     <l n="26">The winds drive backward , and my wings are lame</l>
     <l n="27">And broken , bruised and tired !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="28">I hardly know the path from those old times ;</l>
     <l n="29">I know at first it was a smoother one</l>
     <l n="30">Than this that hurries past me now , and climbs</l>
     <l n="31">So high , its far cliffs even hide the sun</l>
     <l n="32">And shroud in gloom my journey scarce begun .</l>
     <l n="33">I could not do quite all the world required —</l>
     <l n="34">I could not do quite all I should have done ,</l>
     <l n="35">And in my eagerness I have outrun</l>
     <l n="36">My strength — and I am tired ....</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="37">Just tired ! But when of old I had the stay</l>
     <l n="38">Of mother-hands , O very sweet indeed</l>
     <l n="39">It was to dream that all the weary way</l>
     <l n="40">I should but follow where I now must lead —</l>
     <l n="41">For long ago they left me in my need ,</l>
     <l n="42">And , groping on alone , I tripped and mired</l>
     <l n="43">Among rank grasses where the serpents breed</l>
     <l n="44">In knotted coils about the feet of speed .—</l>
     <l n="45">There first it was I tired .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="46">And yet I staggered on , and bore my load</l>
     <l n="47">Right gallantly : The sun , in summer-time ,</l>
     <l n="48">In lazy belts came slipping down the road</l>
     <l n="49">To woo me on , with many a glimmering rhyme</l>
     <l n="50">Rained from the golden rim of some fair clime ,</l>
     <l n="51">That , hovering beyond the clouds , inspired</l>
     <l n="52">My failing heart with fancies so sublime</l>
     <l n="53">I half forgot my path of dust and grime ,</l>
     <l n="54">Though I was growing tired .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="55">And there were many voices cheering me :</l>
     <l n="56">I listened to sweet praises where the wind</l>
     <l n="57">Went laughing o'er my shoulders gleefully</l>
     <l n="58">And scattering my love-songs far behind ;—</l>
     <l n="59">Until , at last , I thought the world so kind —</l>
     <l n="60">So rich in all my yearning soul desired —</l>
     <l n="61">So generous — so loyally inclined ,</l>
     <l n="62">I grew to love and trust it .... I was blind —</l>

    <head>HAS SHE FORGOTTEN ?</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Has she forgotten ? On this very May</l>
     <l n="2">We were to meet here , with the birds and bees ,</l>
     <l n="3">As on that Sabbath , underneath the trees</l>
     <l n="4">We strayed among the tombs , and stripped away</l>
     <l n="5">The vines from these old granites , cold and gray —</l>
     <l n="6">And yet indeed not grim enough were they</l>
     <l n="7">To stay our kisses , smiles and ecstasies ,</l>
     <l n="8">Or closer voice-lost vows and rhapsodies .</l>
     <l n="9">Has she forgotten — that the May has won</l>
     <l n="10">Its promise ?— that the bird-songs from the tree</l>
     <l n="11">Are sprayed above the grasses as the sun</l>
     <l n="12">Might jar the dazzling dew down showeringly ?</l>
     <l n="13">Has she forgotten life — love — everyone —</l>
     <l n="14">Has she forgotten me — forgotten me ?</l>

      <l n="15">Low , low down in the violets I press</l>
      <l n="16">My lips and whisper to her . Does she hear ,</l>
      <l n="17">And yet hold silence , though I call her dear ,</l>
      <l n="18">Just as of old , save for the tearfulness</l>
      <l n="19">Of the clenched eyes , and the soul 's vast distress ?</l>
      <l n="20">Has she forgotten thus the old caress</l>
      <l n="21">That made our breath a quickened atmosphere</l>
      <l n="22">That failed nigh unto swooning with the sheer</l>
      <l n="23">Delight ? Mine arms clutch now this earthen heap</l>
      <l n="24">Sodden with tears that flow on ceaselessly</l>
      <l n="25">As autumn rains the long , long , long nights weep</l>
      <l n="26">In memory of days that used to be ,—</l>
      <l n="27">Has she forgotten these ? And in her sleep ,</l>
      <l n="28">Has she forgotten me — forgotten me ?</l>

      <l n="31">Incalculable darkness make pretense</l>
      <l n="32">That she has risen from her reveries</l>
      <l n="33">To mate her dreams with mine in marriages</l>
      <l n="34">Of mellow palms , smooth faces , and tense ease</l>
      <l n="35">Of every longing nerve of indolence ,—</l>
      <l n="36">Lift from the grave her quiet lips , and stun</l>
      <l n="37">My senses with her kisses — drawl the glee</l>
      <l n="38">Of her glad mouth , full blithe and tenderly ,</l>
      <l n="39">Across mine own , forgetful if is done</l>

    <head>THE SERMON OF THE ROSE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Wilful we are in our infirmity</l>
     <l n="2">Of childish questioning and discontent .</l>
     <l n="3">Whate'er befalls us is divinely meant —</l>
     <l n="4">Thou Truth the clearer for thy mystery !</l>
     <l n="5">Make us to meet what is or is to be</l>
     <l n="6">With fervid welcome , knowing it is sent</l>
     <l n="7">To serve us in some way full excellent ,</l>
     <l n="8">Though we discern it all belatedly .</l>
     <l n="9">The rose buds , and the rose blooms and the rose</l>
     <l n="10">Bows in the dews , and in its fulness , lo ,</l>
     <l n="11">Is in the lover 's hand ,— then on the breast</l>
     <l n="12">Of her he loves ,— and there dies .— And who knows</l>
     <l n="13">Which fate of all a rose may undergo</l>
     <l n="14">Is fairest , dearest , sweetest , loveliest ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="15">Nay , we are children : we will not mature .</l>
     <l n="16">A blessed gift must seem a theft ; and tears</l>
     <l n="17">Must storm our eyes when but a joy appears</l>
     <l n="18">In drear disguise of sorrow ; and how poor</l>
     <l n="19">We seem when we are richest ,— most secure</l>
     <l n="20">Against all poverty the lifelong years</l>
     <l n="21">We yet must waste in childish doubts and fears</l>
     <l n="22">That , in despite of reason , still endure !</l>
     <l n="23">Alas ! the sermon of the rose we will</l>
     <l n="24">Not wisely ponder ; nor the sobs of grief</l>
     <l n="25">Lulled into sighs of rapture ; nor the cry</l>
     <l n="26">Of fierce defiance that again is still .</l>
     <l n="27">Be patient — patient with our frail belief ,</l>
     <l n="28">And stay it yet a little ere we die .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="29">O opulent life of ours , though dispossessed</l>
     <l n="30">Of treasure after treasure ! Youth most fair</l>
     <l n="31">Went first , but left its priceless coil of hair —</l>
     <l n="32">Moaned over sleepless nights , kissed and caressed</l>
     <l n="33">Through drip and blur of tears the tenderest .</l>
     <l n="34">And next went Love — the ripe rose glowing there</l>
     <l n="35">Her very sister !... It is here ; but where</l>
     <l n="36">Is she , of all the world the first and best ?</l>
     <l n="37">And yet how sweet the sweet earth after rain —</l>
     <l n="38">How sweet the sunlight on the garden wall</l>
     <l n="39">Across the roses — and how sweetly flows</l>
     <l n="40">The limpid yodel of the brook again !</l>
     <l n="41">And yet — and yet how sweeter after all ,</l>
     <l n="42">The smouldering sweetness of a dead red rose !</l>
