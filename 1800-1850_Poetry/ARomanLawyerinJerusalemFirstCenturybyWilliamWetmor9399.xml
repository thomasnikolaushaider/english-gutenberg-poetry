     <l n="2">Marcus , abiding in Jerusalem ,</l>
     <l n="3">Greeting to Caius , his best friend in Rome !</l>
     <l n="4">Salve ! these presents will he borne to you</l>
     <l n="5">By Lucius , who is wearied with this place ,</l>
     <l n="6">Sated with travel , looks upon the East</l>
     <l n="7">As simply hateful — blazing , barren , bleak ,</l>
     <l n="8">And longs again to find himself in Rome ,</l>
     <l n="9">After the tumult of its streets , its trains</l>
     <l n="10">Of slaves and clients , and its villas cool</l>
     <l n="11">With marble porticoes beside the sea ,</l>
     <l n="12">And friends and banquets — more than all , its games —</l>
     <l n="13">This life seems blank and flat . He pants to stand</l>
     <l n="14">In its vast circus all alive with heads</l>
     <l n="15">And quivering arms and floating robes — the air</l>
     <l n="16">Thrilled by the roaring fremitus of men —</l>
     <l n="17">The sunlit awning heaving overhead ,</l>
     <l n="18">Swollen and strained against its corded veins</l>
     <l n="19">And flapping out its hem with loud report —</l>
     <l n="20">The wild beasts roaring from the pit below —</l>
     <l n="21">The wilder crowd responding from above</l>
     <l n="22">With one long yell that sends the startled blood</l>
     <l n="23">With thrill and sudden flush into the cheeks —</l>
     <l n="24">A hundred trumpets screaming — the dull thump</l>
     <l n="25">Of horses galloping across the sand —</l>
     <l n="26">The clang of sabbards , the sharp clash of steel —</l>
     <l n="27">Live swords , that whirl a circle of grey fire —</l>
     <l n="28">Brass helmets flashing ‘ neath their streaming hair —</l>
     <l n="29">A universal tumult — then a hush</l>
     <l n="30">Worse than the tumult — all eyes staining down</l>
     <l n="31">To the arena 's pit — all lips set close —</l>
     <l n="32">All muscles strained — and then that sudden yell ,</l>
     <l n="33">Habet !— That 's Rome , says Lucius ! so it is !</l>
     <l n="34">That is , ‘ tis his Rome — ‘ tis not yours and mine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="35">And yet , great Jupiter here at my side ,</l>
     <l n="36">He stands with face aside as if he saw</l>
     <l n="37">The games he thus describes , and says , “ That 's life !</l>
     <l n="38">Life ! life ! my friend , and this is simply death !</l>
     <l n="39">Ah ! for my Rome ! ” I jot his very words</l>
     <l n="40">Just as he utters them . I hate these games ,</l>
     <l n="41">And Darius knows it , yet he will go on ,</l>
     <l n="42">And all against my will he stirs my blood —</l>
     <l n="43">I suspend my letter for a while .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="44">A walk has calmed me — I begin again —</l>
     <l n="45">Letting this last page , since it is written , stand .</l>
     <l n="46">Lucius is going : you will see him soon</l>
     <l n="47">In our great Forum , there with him will walk ,</l>
     <l n="48">And hear him rail and rave against the East .</l>
     <l n="49">I stay behind — for these bare silences ,</l>
     <l n="50">These hills that in the sunset melt and burn ,</l>
     <l n="51">This proud stern people , these dead seas and lakes ,</l>
     <l n="52">These sombre cedars , this intense still sky ,</l>
     <l n="53">To me , o'erwearied with life 's din and strain ,</l>
     <l n="54">Are grateful as the solemn blank of night</l>
     <l n="55">After the fierce day 's irritant excess ;</l>
     <l n="56">Besides , a deep absorbing interest</l>
     <l n="57">Detains me here , fills up my mind , and sways</l>
     <l n="58">My inmost thoughts — has got , as ‘ twere a gripe</l>
     <l n="59">Upon my very life , as strange as new .</l>
     <l n="60">I scarcely know how well to speak of this ,</l>
     <l n="61">Fearing your raillery at best — at worst</l>
     <l n="62">Even your contempt ; yet , spite of all , I speak .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="63">First , do not deem me to have lost my head ,</l>
     <l n="64">Sunstruck , as that man Paulus was at Rome .</l>
     <l n="65">No , I am sane as ever , and my pulse</l>
     <l n="66">Beats even , with no fever in my blood .</l>
     <l n="67">And yet I half incline to think his words ,</l>
     <l n="68">Wild as they were , were not entirely wild .</l>
     <l n="69">Nay , shall I dare avow it ? I half tend ,</l>
     <l n="70">Here in this place , surrounded by these men —</l>
     <l n="71">Despite the jeering natural at first ,</l>
     <l n="72">And then the pressure of my life-long thought</l>
     <l n="73">Trained up against it — to excuse his faith ,</l>
     <l n="74">And half admit the Christus he thinks God</l>
     <l n="75">Is , at the least , a most mysterious man .</l>
     <l n="76">Bear with me if I now avow so much :</l>
     <l n="77">When next we meet I will expose my mind ,</l>
     <l n="78">But now the subject I must scarcely touch .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="79">How many a time , while sauntering up and down</l>
     <l n="80">The Forum 's space , or pausing ‘ neath the shade</l>
     <l n="81">Of some grand temple , arch , or portico ,</l>
     <l n="82">Have we discussed some knotty point of law ,</l>
     <l n="83">Some curious case , whose contradicting facts</l>
     <l n="84">Looked Janus-faced to innocence and guilt .</l>
     <l n="85">I see you now arresting me , to note</l>
     <l n="86">With quiet fervor and uplifted hand</l>
     <l n="87">Some subtle view or fact by me o'erlooked ,</l>
     <l n="88">And urging me , who always strain my point</l>
     <l n="89">( Being too much , I know , a partisan ) ,</l>
     <l n="90">To pause , and press not to the issue so ,</l>
     <l n="91">But more apart , with less impetuous zeal ,</l>
     <l n="92">Survey as from an upper floor the facts .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="93">I need you now to rein me in , too quick</l>
     <l n="94">To ride a whim beyond the term of Truth ,</l>
     <l n="95">For here a case comes up to which in vain</l>
     <l n="96">I seek a clue : you could clear up my mind ,</l>
     <l n="97">But you are absent — so I send these notes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="98">The case is of one Judas , Simon 's son ,</l>
     <l n="99">Iscariot called — a Jew — and one of those</l>
     <l n="100">Who followed Christus , held by some a god ,</l>
     <l n="101">But deemed by others to have preached and taught</l>
     <l n="102">A superstition vile , of which one point</l>
     <l n="103">Was worship of an ass ; but this is false !</l>
     <l n="104">Judas , his follower , all the sect declare ,</l>
     <l n="105">Bought by a bribe of thirty silver coins ,</l>
     <l n="106">Basely betrayed his master unto death .</l>
     <l n="107">The question is — Did Judas , doing this ,</l>
     <l n="108">Act from base motives and commit a crime ?</l>
     <l n="109">Or , all things taken carefully in view ,</l>
     <l n="110">Can he be justified in what he did ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="111">Here on the spot , surrounded by the men</l>
     <l n="112">Who acted in the drama , I have sought</l>
     <l n="113">To study out this strange and tragic case .</l>
     <l n="114">Many are dead — as Herod , Caiaphas ,</l>
     <l n="115">And also Pilate — a most worthy man ,</l>
     <l n="116">Under whose rule , but all without his fault ,</l>
     <l n="117">And , as I fancy , all against his will ,</l>
     <l n="118">Christus was crucified . This I regret :</l>
     <l n="119">His words with me would have the greatest weight ;</l>
     <l n="120">But Lysias still is living , an old man ,</l>
     <l n="121">The chief of the Centurions , whose report</l>
     <l n="122">Is to be trusted , as he saw and heard ,</l>
     <l n="123">Not once , but many a time and oft , this man .</l>
     <l n="124">His look and bearing , Lysias thus describes :</l>
     <l n="125">“ Tall , slender , not erect , a little bent ;</l>
     <l n="126">Brows arched and dark ; a high-ridged lofty head ;</l>
     <l n="127">Thin temples , veined and delicate ; large eyes ,</l>
     <l n="128">Sad , very serious , seeming as it were</l>
     <l n="129">To look beyond you , and whene'er he spoke</l>
     <l n="130">Illumined by an inner lamping light —</l>
     <l n="131">At times , too , gleaming with a strange wild fire</l>
     <l n="132">When taunted by the rabble in the streets ;</l>
     <l n="133">A Jewish face , complexion pale but dark ;</l>
     <l n="134">Thin , high-art nostrils , quivering constantly ;</l>
     <l n="135">Long nose , full lips , hands tapering , full of veins ;</l>
     <l n="136">His movements nervous ; as he walked he seemed</l>
     <l n="137">Scarcely to heed the persons whom he passed ,</l>
     <l n="138">And for the most part gazed upon the ground .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="139">“ As for his followers , I knew them all —</l>
     <l n="140">A strange mad set and full of fancies wild —</l>
     <l n="141">John , Peter , James — and Judas best of all —</l>
     <l n="142">All seemed to me good men without offence —</l>
     <l n="143">A little crazed — but who is wholly sane ?</l>
     <l n="144">They went about and cured the sick and halt ,</l>
     <l n="145">And gave away their money to the poor ,</l>
     <l n="146">And all their talk was charity and peace .</l>
     <l n="147">If Christus thought and said he was a god ,</l>
     <l n="148">‘ Twas harmless madness , not deserving death .</l>
     <l n="149">What most aroused the wealthy Rabbis ’ rage</l>
     <l n="150">Was that he set the poor against the rich ,</l>
     <l n="151">And cried that rich men all would go to hell ,</l>
     <l n="152">And , worst of all , roundly denounced the priests ,</l>
     <l n="153">With all their rich phylacteries and robes —</l>
     <l n="154">Said they were hypocrites who made long prayers ,</l>
     <l n="155">And robbed poor widows and devoured their means ;</l>
     <l n="156">And were at best but whited sepulchres :</l>
     <l n="157">And this it was that brought him to the Cross .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="158">“ Those who went with him and believed in him</l>
     <l n="159">Were mostly dull , uneducated men ,</l>
     <l n="160">Simple and honest , dazed by what he did ,</l>
     <l n="161">And misconceiving every word he said .</l>
     <l n="162">He led them with him in a spell-bound awe ,</l>
     <l n="163">And all his cures they called miraculous .</l>
     <l n="164">They followed him like sheep where'er he went ,</l>
     <l n="165">With feelings mixed of wonder , fear and love .</l>
     <l n="166">Yes ! I suppose they loved him , though they fled</l>
     <l n="167">Stricken with fear when we arrested him . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="168">“ What ! all — all fled ? ” I asked . “ Did none remain ? ”</l>
     <l n="169">“ Not one , ” he said — “ all left him to his fate ,</l>
     <l n="170">Not one dared own he was a follower —</l>
     <l n="171">Not one gave witness for him of them all .</l>
     <l n="172">Stop ! When I say not one of them , I mean</l>
     <l n="173">No one but Judas — Judas whom they call</l>
     <l n="174">The traitor — who betrayed him to his death .</l>
     <l n="175">He rushed into the council-hall and cried ,</l>
     <l n="176">‘'Tis I have sinned — Christus is innocent . ’ ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="177">And here I come to what of all I 've heard</l>
     <l n="178">Most touched me — I for this my letter write .</l>
     <l n="179">Paulus , you know , had only for this man ,</l>
     <l n="180">This Judas , words of scorn and bitter hate .</l>
     <l n="181">Mark now the different view that Lysias took ,</l>
     <l n="182">When , urged by me , his story thus he told :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="183">“ Some say that Judas was a base , vile man</l>
     <l n="184">Who sold his master for the meanest bribe ;</l>
     <l n="185">Others again insist he was most right ,</l>
     <l n="186">Giving to justice one who merely sought</l>
     <l n="187">To overthrow the Church , subvert the law ,</l>
     <l n="188">And on its ruins build himself a throne .</l>
     <l n="189">I , knowing Judas — and none better knew —</l>
     <l n="190">I , caring naught for Christus more than him ,</l>
     <l n="191">But hating lies , the simple truth will tell ,</l>
     <l n="192">No man can say I ever told a lie —</l>
     <l n="193">I am too old now to begin . Besides ,</l>
     <l n="194">The truth is truth , and let the truth be told .</l>
     <l n="195">Judas , I say , alone of all the men</l>
     <l n="196">Who followed Christus thought that he was God .</l>
     <l n="197">Some feared him for his power of miracles ;</l>
     <l n="198">Some were attracted by a sort of spell ;</l>
     <l n="199">Some followed him to hear his sweet , clear voice</l>
     <l n="200">And gentle speaking , hearing with their ears ,</l>
     <l n="201">And knowing not the sense of what he said —</l>
     <l n="202">But one alone believed he was the Lord ,</l>
     <l n="203">The true Messiah of the Jews . That one</l>
     <l n="204">Was Judas — he alone of all the crowd .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="205">“ He to betray his master for a bribe !</l>
     <l n="206">He last of all . I say this friend of mine</l>
     <l n="207">Was brave when all the rest were cowards there .</l>
     <l n="208">His was a noble nature : frank and bold ,</l>
     <l n="209">Almost to rashness bold , yet sensitive ,</l>
     <l n="210">Who took his dreams for firm realities —</l>
     <l n="211">Who once believing , all in all believed —</l>
     <l n="212">Rushing at obstacles and scorning risk ,</l>
     <l n="213">Ready to venture all to gain his end ,</l>
     <l n="214">No compromise or subterfuge for him ,</l>
     <l n="215">His act went from his thought straight to the butt ;</l>
     <l n="216">Yet with this ardent and impatient mood</l>
     <l n="217">Was joined a visionary mind that took</l>
     <l n="218">Impressions quick and fine , yet deep as life .</l>
     <l n="219">Therefore it was that in this subtle soil</l>
     <l n="220">The master 's words took root and grew and flowered .</l>
     <l n="221">He heard and followed and obeyed ; his faith</l>
     <l n="222">was serious , earnest , real — winged to fly ;</l>
     <l n="223">He doubted not , like some who walked with him —</l>
     <l n="224">Desired no first place , as did James and John —</l>
     <l n="225">Denied him not with Peter : not to him</l>
     <l n="226">His master said , ‘ Away ! thou'rt an offence ;</l>
     <l n="227">Get thee behind me , Satan ! ’ — not to him ,</l>
     <l n="228">‘ Am I so long with ye who know me not ? ’</l>
     <l n="229">Fixed as a rock , untempted by desires</l>
     <l n="230">To gain the post of honor when his Lord</l>
     <l n="231">Should come to rule — chosen from out the midst</l>
     <l n="232">Of six-score men as his apostle — then</l>
     <l n="233">Again selected to the place of trust ,</l>
     <l n="234">Unselfish , honest , he among them walked .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="235">“ That he was honest , and was so esteemed ,</l>
     <l n="236">Is plain from this — they chose him out of all</l>
     <l n="237">To bear the common purse , and take and pay .</l>
     <l n="238">John says he was a thief , because he grudged</l>
     <l n="239">The price that for some ointment once was paid ,</l>
     <l n="240">And urged ‘ twere better given to the poor .</l>
     <l n="241">But did not Christus ever for the poor</l>
     <l n="242">Lift up his voice — ‘ Give all things to the poor !</l>
     <l n="243">Sell everything and give all to the poor ! ’</l>
     <l n="244">And Judas , who believed , not made believe ,</l>
     <l n="245">Used his own words , and Christus , who excused</l>
     <l n="246">The gift because of love , rebuked him not .</l>
     <l n="247">Thief ! ay , he ‘ twas , this very thief , they chose</l>
     <l n="248">To bear the purse and give alms to the poor .</l>
     <l n="249">I , for my part , see nothing wrong in this . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="250">“ But why , if Judas was a man like this ,</l>
     <l n="251">Frank , noble , honest ” — here I interposed —</l>

     <l n="531">I said no ill of him . If crime there be ,</l>
     <l n="532">‘ Twas yours who doomed him unto death , not mine . ”</l>
     <l n="533">A villain was he ? So Barabbas was !</l>
     <l n="534">But did Barabbas go and hang himself ,</l>
     <l n="535">Weary of life — the murderer and thief ?</l>
     <l n="536">This coarse and vulgar way will never do .</l>
     <l n="537">Grant him a villain , all his , acts must be</l>
     <l n="538">Acts of a villain ; if you once admit</l>
     <l n="539">Remorse so bitter that it leads to death ,</l>
     <l n="540">And death so instant on the heels of crime ,</l>
     <l n="541">You grant a spirit sensitive to shame ,</l>
     <l n="542">So sensitive that life can yield no joys</l>
     <l n="543">To counterbalance one bad act ;— but then</l>
     <l n="544">A nature such as this , though led astray ,</l>
     <l n="545">When greatly tempted , is no thorough wretch .</l>
     <l n="546">Was the temptation great ? could such a bribe</l>
     <l n="547">Tempt such a nature to a crime like this ?</l>
     <l n="548">I say , to me it simply seems absurd .</l>
     <l n="549">Peter at least was not so sensitive .</l>
     <l n="550">He cursed and swore , denying that he knew</l>
     <l n="551">Who the man Christus was ; but after all</l>
     <l n="552">He only wept — he never hanged himself .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="37">
     <l n="553">But take the other view that Lysias takes ,</l>
     <l n="554">All is at once consistent , clear , complete .</l>
     <l n="555">Firm in the faith that Christus was his God</l>
     <l n="556">The great Messiah sent to save the world ,</l>
     <l n="557">He , seeking for a sign — not for himself ,</l>
     <l n="558">But to show proof to all that he was God</l>
     <l n="559">Conceived this plan , rash if you will , but grand .</l>
     <l n="560">“ Thinking him man , ” he said , “ mere mortal man ,</l>
     <l n="561">They seek to seize him — I will make pretence</l>
     <l n="562">To take the public bribe and point him out ,</l>
     <l n="563">And they shall go , all armed with swords and staves ,</l>
     <l n="564">Strong with the power of law , to seize on him —</l>
     <l n="565">And at their touch he , God himself , shall stand</l>
     <l n="566">Revealed before them , and their swords drop ,</l>
     <l n="567">And prostrate all before him shall adore ,</l>
     <l n="568">And cry , ‘ Behold the Lord and King of all ! ’ ”</l>
     <l n="569">But when the soldiers laid their hands on him</l>
     <l n="570">And bound him as they would a prisoner vile ,</l>
     <l n="571">With taunts , and mockery , and threats of death —</l>
     <l n="572">He all the while submitting — then his dream</l>
     <l n="573">Burst into fragments with a crash : aghast</l>
     <l n="574">The whole world reeled before him ; the dread truth</l>
     <l n="575">Swooped like a sea upon him , bearing down</l>
     <l n="576">His thoughts in wild confusion . He who dreamed</l>
     <l n="577">To open the gates of glory to his Lord ,</l>
     <l n="578">Opened in their stead the prison 's jarring door ,</l>
     <l n="579">And saw above him his dim dream of Love</l>
     <l n="580">Change to a Fury stained with blood and crime .</l>
     <l n="581">And then a madness seized him , and remorse</l>
     <l n="582">With pangs of torture drove him down to death .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="38">
     <l n="583">Conceive with me that sad and suffering heart</l>
     <l n="584">If this be true that Lysias says — Conceive !</l>
     <l n="585">Alas ! Orestes , not so sad thy fate ,</l>
     <l n="586">For the Apollo pardoned , purified —</l>
     <l n="587">Thy Furies were appeased , thy peace returned ,</l>
     <l n="588">But Judas perished tortured unto death ,</l>
     <l n="589">Unpardoned , unappeased , unpurified .</l>
     <l n="590">And long as Christus shall be known of men</l>
     <l n="591">His name shall bear the brand of infamy ,</l>
     <l n="592">The curse of generations still unborn .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="39">
     <l n="593">Thus much of him : I leave the question here ,</l>
     <l n="594">Touching on naught beyond , for Lucius waits —</l>
     <l n="595">I hear him fuming in the court below ,</l>
     <l n="596">Cursing his servants and Jerusalem ,</l>
     <l n="597">And giving them to the infernal gods .</l>
     <l n="598">The sun is sinking — all the sky 's afire —</l>
     <l n="599">And vale and mountain glow like molten ore</l>
     <l n="600">In the intense full splendor of its rays .</l>
     <l n="601">A half-hour hence all will be dull and grey ;</l>
     <l n="602">And Lucius only waits until the shade</l>
     <l n="603">Sweeps down the plain then mounts and makes his way</l>
     <l n="604">On through the blinding desert to the sea ,</l>
     <l n="605">And thence his galley bears him on to Rome .</l>
