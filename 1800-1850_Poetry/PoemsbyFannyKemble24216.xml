    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Oh , thou surpassing beauty ! that dost live</l>
     <l n="3">Shrined in yon silent stream of glorious light !</l>
     <l n="4">Spirit of harmony ! that through the vast</l>
     <l n="5">And cloud-embroidered canopy art spreading</l>
     <l n="6">Thy wings , that o'er our shadowy earth hang brooding ,</l>
     <l n="7">Like a pale silver haze , betwixt the moon</l>
     <l n="8">And the world 's darker orb : beautiful , hail !</l>
     <l n="9">Hail to thee ! from her midnight throne of ether ,</l>
     <l n="10">Night looks upon the slumbering universe .</l>
     <l n="11">There is no breeze on silver-crowned tree ,</l>
     <l n="12">There is no breath on dew-bespangled flower ,</l>
     <l n="13">There is no wind sighs on the sleepy wave ,</l>
     <l n="14">There is no sound hangs in the solemn air .</l>
     <l n="15">All , all are silent , all are dreaming , all ,</l>
     <l n="16">Save those eternal eyes , that now shine forth</l>
     <l n="17">Winking the slumberer 's destinies . The moon</l>
     <l n="18">Sails on the horizon 's verge , a moving glory ,</l>
     <l n="19">Pure , and unrivalled ; for no paler orb</l>
     <l n="20">Approaches , to invade the sea of light</l>
     <l n="21">That lives around her ; save yon little star ,</l>
     <l n="22">That sparkles on her robe of fleecy clouds ,</l>
     <l n="23">Like a bright gem , fallen from her radiant brow .</l>

    <head>VENICE .</head>
     <l n="1">Night in her dark array</l>
     <l n="2">Steals o'er the ocean ,</l>
     <l n="3">And with departed day</l>
     <l n="4">Hushed seems its motion .</l>
     <l n="5">Slowly o'er yon blue coast</l>
     <l n="6">Onward she 's treading ,</l>
     <l n="7">‘ Till its dark line is lost ,</l>
     <l n="8">‘ Neath her veil spreading .</l>
     <l n="9">The bark on the rippling deep</l>
     <l n="10">Hath found a pillow ,</l>
     <l n="11">And the pale moonbeams sleep</l>
     <l n="12">On the green billow .</l>
     <l n="13">Bound by her emerald zone</l>
     <l n="14">Venice is lying ,</l>
     <l n="15">And round her marble crown</l>
     <l n="16">Night winds are sighing .</l>
     <l n="17">From the high lattice now</l>
     <l n="18">Bright eyes are gleaming ,</l>
     <l n="19">That seem on night 's dark brow</l>
     <l n="20">Brighter stars beaming .</l>
     <l n="21">Now o'er the bright lagune</l>
     <l n="22">Light barks are dancing ,</l>
     <l n="23">And ‘ neath the silver moon</l>
     <l n="24">Swift oars are glancing .</l>
     <l n="25">Strains from the mandolin</l>
     <l n="26">Steal o'er the water ,</l>
     <l n="27">Echo replies between</l>
     <l n="28">To mirth and laughter .</l>
     <l n="29">O'er the wave seen afar</l>
     <l n="30">Brilliantly shining ,</l>
     <l n="31">Gleams like a fallen star</l>
     <l n="32">Venice reclining .</l>

    <head>TO MISS — -</head>
     <l n="1">Time beckons on the hours : the expiring year</l>
     <l n="2">Already feels old Winter 's icy breath ;</l>
     <l n="3">As with cold hands , he scatters on her bier</l>
     <l n="4">The faded glories of her Autumn wreath .</l>
     <l n="5">As fleetly as the Summer 's sunshine past ,</l>
     <l n="6">The Winter 's snow must melt ; and the young Spring ,</l>
     <l n="7">Strewing the earth with flowers , will come at last ,</l>
     <l n="8">And in her train the hour of parting bring .</l>
     <l n="9">But , though I leave the harbour , where my heart</l>
     <l n="10">Sometime had found a peaceful resting-place ,</l>
     <l n="11">Where it lay calmly moored ; though I depart ,</l>
     <l n="12">Yet , let not time my memory quite efface .</l>
     <l n="13">‘ Tis true , I leave no void , the happy home</l>
     <l n="14">To which you welcomed me , will be as gay ,</l>
     <l n="15">As bright , as cheerful , when I 've turned to roam ,</l>
     <l n="16">Once more , upon life 's weary onward way .</l>
     <l n="17">But oh ! if ever by the warm hearth 's blaze ,</l>
     <l n="18">Where beaming eyes and kindred souls are met ,</l>
     <l n="19">Your fancy wanders back to former days ,</l>
     <l n="20">Let my remembrance hover round you yet .</l>
     <l n="21">Then , while before you glides time 's shadowy train ,</l>
     <l n="22">Of forms long vanished , days and hours long gone ,</l>
     <l n="23">Perchance my name will be pronounced again ,</l>
     <l n="24">In that dear circle where I once was one .</l>
     <l n="25">Think of me then , nor break kind memory 's spell ,</l>
     <l n="26">By reason 's censure coldly o'er me cast ,</l>
     <l n="27">Think only , that I loved ye passing well !</l>
     <l n="28">And let my follies slumber with the past .</l>

    <head>THE WIND .</head>
     <l n="1">Night comes upon the earth ; and fearfully</l>
     <l n="2">Arise the mighty winds , and sweep along</l>
     <l n="3">In the full chorus of their midnight song .</l>
     <l n="4">The waste of heavy clouds , that veil the sky ,</l>
     <l n="5">Roll like a murky scroll before them driven ,</l>
     <l n="6">And show faint glimpses of a darker heaven .</l>
     <l n="7">No ray is there of moon , or pale-eyed star ,</l>
     <l n="8">Darkness is on the universe ; save where</l>
     <l n="9">The western sky lies glimmering , faint and far ,</l>
     <l n="10">With day 's red embers dimly glowing there .</l>
     <l n="11">Hark ! how the wind comes gathering in its course ,</l>
     <l n="12">And sweeping onward , with resistless force ,</l>
     <l n="13">Howls through the silent space of starless skies ,</l>
     <l n="14">And on the breast of the swol'n ocean dies .</l>
     <l n="15">Oh , though art terrible , thou viewless power !</l>
     <l n="16">That rid'st destroying at the midnight hour !</l>
     <l n="17">We hear thy mighty pinion , but the eye</l>
     <l n="18">Knows nothing of thine awful majesty .</l>
     <l n="19">We see all mute creation bow before</l>
     <l n="20">Thy viewless wings , as thou careerest o'er</l>
     <l n="21">This rocking world ; that in the boundless sky</l>
     <l n="22">Suspended , vibrates , as thou rushest by .</l>
     <l n="23">There is no terror in the lightning 's glare ,</l>
     <l n="24">That breaks its red track through the trackless air ;</l>
     <l n="25">There is no terror in the voice that speaks</l>
     <l n="26">From out the clouds when the loud thunder breaks</l>
     <l n="27">Over the earth , like that which dwells in thee ,</l>
     <l n="28">Thou unseen tenant of immensity .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>EASTERN SUNSET .</head>
     <l n="1">‘ Tis only the nightingale 's warbled strain ,</l>
     <l n="2">That floats through the evening sky :</l>
     <l n="3">With his note of love , he replies again ,</l>
     <l n="4">To the muezzin 's holy cry ;</l>
     <l n="5">As it sweetly sounds on the rosy air ,</l>
     <l n="6">“ Allah , il allah ! come to prayer ! ”</l>
     <l n="7">Warm o'er the waters the red sun is glowing ,</l>
     <l n="8">‘ Tis the last parting glance of his splendour and might ,</l>
     <l n="9">While each rippling wave on the bright shore is throwing</l>
     <l n="10">Its white crest , that breaks into showers of light .</l>
     <l n="11">Each distant mosque and minaret</l>
     <l n="12">Is shining in the setting sun ,</l>
     <l n="13">Whose farewell look is brighter yet ,</l>
     <l n="14">Than that with which his course begun .</l>
     <l n="15">On the dark blue mountains his smile is bright ,</l>
     <l n="16">It glows on the orange grove 's waving height ,</l>
     <l n="17">And breaks through its shade in long lines of light .</l>
     <l n="18">No sound on the earth , and no sound in the sky ,</l>
     <l n="19">Save murmuring fountains that sparkle nigh ,</l>
     <l n="20">And the rustling flight of the evening breeze ,</l>
     <l n="21">Who steals from his nest in the cypress trees ,</l>
     <l n="22">And a thousand dewy odours fling ,</l>
     <l n="23">As he shakes their white buds from his gossamer wing ,</l>
     <l n="24">And flutters away through the spicy air ,</l>
     <l n="25">At sound of a footstep drawing near .</l>

    <head>FAREWELL TO ITALY .</head>
     <l n="1">Farewell awhile , beautiful Italy !</l>
     <l n="2">My lonely bark is launched upon the sea</l>
     <l n="3">That clasps thy shore , and the soft evening gale</l>
     <l n="4">Breathes from thy coast , and fills my parting sail .</l>
     <l n="5">Ere morning dawn , a colder breeze will come ,</l>
     <l n="6">And bear me onward to my northern home ;</l>
     <l n="7">That home , where the pale sun is not so bright ,</l>
     <l n="8">So glorious , at his noonday 's fiercest height ,</l>
     <l n="9">As when he throws his last glance o'er the sea ,</l>
     <l n="10">And fires the heavens , that glow farewell on thee .</l>
     <l n="11">Fair Italy ! perchance some future day</l>
     <l n="12">Upon thy coast again will see me stray ;</l>
     <l n="13">Meantime , farewell ! I sorrow , as I leave</l>
     <l n="14">Thy lovely shore behind me , as men grieve</l>
     <l n="15">When bending o'er a form , around whose charms ,</l>
     <l n="16">Unconquered yet , Death winds his icy arms :</l>
     <l n="17">While leaving the last kiss on some dear cheek ,</l>
     <l n="18">Where beauty sheds her last autumnal streak ,</l>
     <l n="19">Life 's rosy flower just mantling into bloom ,</l>
     <l n="20">Before it fades for ever in the tomb .</l>
     <l n="21">So I leave thee , oh ! thou art lovely still !</l>
     <l n="22">Despite the clouds of infamy and ill</l>
     <l n="23">That gather thickly round thy fading form :</l>
     <l n="24">Still glow thy glorious skies , as bright and warm ,</l>
     <l n="25">Still memory lingers fondly on thy strand ,</l>
     <l n="26">And Genius hails thee still her native land .</l>
     <l n="27">Land of my soul 's adoption ! o'er the sea ,</l>
     <l n="28">Thy sunny shore is fading rapidly :</l>
     <l n="29">Fainter and fainter , from my gaze it dies ,</l>
     <l n="30">‘ Till like a line of distant light it lies ,</l>
     <l n="31">A melting boundary ‘ twixt earth and sky ,</l>
     <l n="32">And now ‘ tis gone ;— farewell , fair Italy !</l>

     <l n="6">Alive with beings , beautiful and fearful .</l>
     <l n="7">And as the chain of thought grew link by link ,</l>
     <l n="8">It seemed , as though the midnight heavens waxed brighter ,</l>
     <l n="9">The stars gazed fix'dly with their golden eyes ,</l>
     <l n="10">And a strange light played o'er each sleeping billow ,</l>
     <l n="11">That laid its head upon the sandy beach .</l>
     <l n="12">Anon there came along the rocky shore</l>
     <l n="13">A far-off sound of sweetest minstrelsy .</l>
     <l n="14">From no one point of heaven , or earth , it came ;</l>
     <l n="15">But under , over , and about it breathed ,</l>
     <l n="16">Filling my soul with thrilling , fearful pleasure .</l>
     <l n="17">It swelled , as though borne on the floating wings</l>
     <l n="18">Of the midsummer breeze : it died away</l>
     <l n="19">Towards heaven , as though it sank into the clouds ,</l>
     <l n="20">That one by one melted like flakes of snow</l>
     <l n="21">In the moonbeams . Then came a rushing sound ,</l>
     <l n="22">Like countless wings of bees , or butterflies ;</l>
     <l n="23">And suddenly , as far as eye might view ,</l>
     <l n="24">The coast was peopled with a world of elves ,</l>
     <l n="25">Who in fantastic ringlets danced around ,</l>
     <l n="26">With antic gestures , and wild beckoning motion ,</l>
     <l n="27">Aimed at the moon . White was their snowy vesture ,</l>
     <l n="28">And shining as the Alps , when that the sun</l>
     <l n="29">Gems their pale robes with diamonds . On their heads</l>
     <l n="30">Were wreaths of crimson and of yellow foxglove .</l>
     <l n="31">They were all fair , and light as dreams ; anon</l>
     <l n="32">The dance broke off ; and sailing through the air ,</l>
     <l n="33">Some one way , and some other , they did each</l>
     <l n="34">Alight upon some waving branch , or flower ,</l>
     <l n="35">That garlanded the rocks upon the shore .</l>
     <l n="36">One , chiefly , did I mark , one tiny sprite ,</l>
     <l n="37">Who crept into an orange flower-bell ,</l>
     <l n="38">And there lay nestling , whilst his eager lips</l>
     <l n="39">Drank from its virgin chalice the night dew ,</l>
     <l n="40">That glistened , like a pearl , in its white bosom .</l>

     <l n="1">It was the harvest time : the broad , bright moon</l>
     <l n="2">Was at her full , and shone upon the fields</l>
     <l n="3">Where we had toiled the livelong day , to pile</l>
     <l n="4">In golden sheaves the earth 's abundant treasure .</l>
     <l n="5">The harvest task had given place to song</l>
     <l n="6">And merry dance ; and these in turn were chased</l>
     <l n="7">By legends strange , and wild , unearthly tales</l>
     <l n="8">Of elves , and gnomes , and fairy sprites , that haunt</l>
     <l n="9">The woods and caves ; where they do sleep all day ,</l>
     <l n="10">And then come forth i ’ the witching hour of night ,</l>
     <l n="11">To dance by moonlight on the green thick sward .</l>
     <l n="12">The speaker was an aged villager ,</l>
     <l n="13">In whom his oft-told tale awoke no fears ,</l>
     <l n="14">Such as he filled his gaping listeners with .</l>
     <l n="15">Nor ever was there break in his discourse ,</l>
     <l n="16">Save when with gray eyes lifted to the moon ,</l>
     <l n="17">He conjured from the past strange instances</l>
     <l n="18">Of kidnapp 'd infants , from their cradles snatch 'd ,</l>
     <l n="19">And changed for elvish sprites ; of blights , and blains ,</l>
     <l n="20">Sent on the cattle by the vengeful fairies ;</l>
     <l n="21">Of blasted crops , maim 'd limbs , and unsound minds ,</l>
     <l n="22">All plagues inflicted by these angered sprites .</l>
     <l n="23">Then would he pause , and wash his story down</l>
     <l n="24">With long-drawn draughts of amber ale ; while all</l>
     <l n="25">The rest came crowding under the wide oak tree ,</l>
     <l n="26">Piling the corn sheaves closer round the ring ,</l>
     <l n="27">Whispering and shaking , laughing too , with fear ;</l>
     <l n="28">And ever , if an acorn bobb 'd from the boughs ,</l>
     <l n="29">Or grasshopper from out the stubble chirrupp 'd ,</l>

     <l n="18">Perchance theirs is a darker doom than ours ;</l>
     <l n="19">Unchanging woe , and endless misery ,</l>
     <l n="20">And mourning that hath neither days nor hours .</l>
     <l n="21">Horrible dream !— Oh dark and dismal path ,</l>
     <l n="22">Where I now weeping walk , I will not leave thee ;</l>
     <l n="23">Earth has one boon for all her children — death :</l>
     <l n="24">Open thy arms , oh mother ! and receive me !</l>
     <l n="25">Take off the bitter burthen from the slave ,</l>

    <head>WRITTEN AFTER SPENDING A DAY AT WEST POINT .</head>
     <l n="1">Were they but dreams ? Upon the darkening world</l>
     <l n="2">Evening comes down , the wings of fire are furled ,</l>
     <l n="3">On which the day soared to the sunny west :</l>
     <l n="4">The moon sits calmly , like a soul at rest ,</l>
     <l n="5">Looking upon the never-resting earth ;</l>
     <l n="6">All things in heaven wait on the solemn birth</l>
     <l n="7">Of night , but where has fled the happy dream</l>
     <l n="8">That at this hour , last night , our life did seem ?</l>
     <l n="9">Where are the mountains with their tangled hair ,</l>
     <l n="10">The leafy hollow , and the rocky stair ?</l>
     <l n="11">Where are the shadows of the solemn hills ,</l>
     <l n="12">And the fresh music of the summer rills ?</l>
     <l n="13">Where are the wood-paths , winding , long and steep ,</l>
     <l n="14">And the great , glorious river , broad and deep ,</l>
     <l n="15">And the thick copses , where soft breezes meet ,</l>
     <l n="16">And the wild torrent 's snowy , leaping feet ,</l>
     <l n="17">The rustling , rocking boughs , the running streams ,—</l>
     <l n="18">Where are they all ? gone , gone ! were they but dreams ?</l>
     <l n="19">And where , oh where are the light footsteps gone ,</l>
     <l n="20">That from the mountain-side came dancing down ?</l>
     <l n="21">The voices full of mirth , the loving eyes ,</l>
     <l n="22">The happy hearts , the human paradise ,</l>
     <l n="23">The youth , the love , the life that revelled here ,—</l>
     <l n="24">Are they too gone ?— Upon Time 's shadowy bier ,</l>
     <l n="25">The pale , cold hours of joys now past , are laid ,</l>
     <l n="26">Perhaps , not soon from memory 's gaze to fade ,</l>
     <l n="27">But never to be reckoned o'er again ,</l>
     <l n="28">In all life 's future store of bliss and pain .</l>
     <l n="29">From the bright eyes the sunshine may depart ,</l>
     <l n="30">Youth flies — love dies — and from the joyous heart</l>
     <l n="31">Hope 's gushing fountain ebbs too soon away ,</l>
     <l n="32">Nor spares one drop for that disastrous day ,</l>
     <l n="33">When from the barren waste of after life ,</l>
     <l n="34">The weariness , the worldliness , the strife ,</l>
     <l n="35">The soul looks o'er the desert of its way</l>
     <l n="36">To the green gardens of its early day :</l>
     <l n="37">The paradise , for which we vainly mourn ,</l>
     <l n="38">The heaven , to which our ling'ring eyes still turn ,</l>
     <l n="39">To which our footsteps never shall return .</l>

    <head>THE PRAYER OF A LONELY HEART .</head>
     <l n="1">I am alone — oh be thou near to me ,</l>
     <l n="2">Great God ! from whom the meanest are not far .</l>
     <l n="3">Not in presumption of the daring spirit ,</l>
     <l n="4">Striving to find the secrets of itself ,</l>
     <l n="5">Make I my weeping prayer ; in the deep want</l>
     <l n="6">Of utter loneliness , my God ! I seek thee ;</l>
     <l n="7">If the worm may creep up to thy fellowship ,</l>
     <l n="8">Or dust , instinct with yearning , rise towards thee .</l>
     <l n="9">I have no fellow , Father ! of my kind ;</l>
     <l n="10">None that be kindred , none companion to me ,</l>
     <l n="11">And the vast love , and harmony , and brotherhood ,</l>
     <l n="12">Of the dumb creatures thou hast made below me ,</l>
     <l n="13">Vexes my soul with its own bitter lot .</l>
     <l n="14">Around me grow the trees , each by the other ;</l>
     <l n="15">Innumerable leaves , each like the other ,</l>
     <l n="16">Whisper and breathe , and live and move together .</l>
     <l n="17">Around me spring the flowers ; each rosy cup</l>
     <l n="18">Hath sisters , leaning their fair cheeks against it .</l>
     <l n="19">The birds fly all above me ; not alone ,</l>
     <l n="20">But coupled in free fellowship , or mustering</l>
     <l n="21">A joyous band , weeping in companies</l>
     <l n="22">The wide blue fields between the clouds ;— the clouds</l>
     <l n="23">Troop in society , each on the other</l>
     <l n="24">Shedding , like sympathy , reflected light .</l>
     <l n="25">The waves , a multitude , together run</l>
     <l n="26">To the great breast of the receiving sea :</l>
     <l n="27">Nothing but hath its kind , its company ,</l>
     <l n="28">Oh God ! save I alone ! then , let me come ,</l>
     <l n="29">Good Father ! to thy feet , when even as now ,</l>
     <l n="30">Tears , that no human hand is near to wipe ,</l>
     <l n="31">O'erbrim my eyes , oh wipe them , thou , my Father !</l>
     <l n="32">When in my heart the stores of its affections ,</l>
     <l n="33">Piled up unused , locked fast , are like to burst</l>
     <l n="34">The fleshly casket , that may not contain them ,</l>
     <l n="35">Let me come nigh to thee ;— accept thou them ,</l>
     <l n="36">Dear Father !— Fount of Love ! Compassionate God !</l>
     <l n="37">When in my spirit burns the fire , the power ,</l>
     <l n="38">That have made men utter the words of angels ,</l>
     <l n="39">And none are near to bid me speak and live :</l>
     <l n="40">Hearken , oh Father ! Maker of my spirit !</l>
     <l n="41">God of my soul , to thee I will outpour</l>
     <l n="42">The hymns resounding through my troubled mind ,</l>
     <l n="43">The sighs and sorrows of my lonely heart ,</l>
     <l n="44">The tears , and weeping , of my weary eyes :</l>
