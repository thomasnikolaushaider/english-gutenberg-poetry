    <head>PREFACE TO THE TRANSLATIONS .</head>
    <p n="1">I think every man who can should help his people to inherit the earth by bringing into his own of the wealth of other tongues . In the flower-pots of translation I offer these few exotics , with no little labour taught to exist , I hope to breathe , in English air . Such labour is to me no less serious than delightful , for to do a man 's work , in the process of carrying over , more injury than must be , is a serious wrong .</p>
    <p n="2">I have endeavoured , first of all , to give the spirit of the poetry .</p>
    <p n="3">Next , I have sought to retain each individual meaning that goes to form the matter of a poem .</p>
    <p n="4">Third , I have aimed at preserving the peculiar mode , the aroma of the poet 's style , so far as I could do it without offence to the translating English .</p>
    <p n="5">Fourth , both rhythm and rime being essential elements of every poem in which they are used , I have sought to respect them rigorously .</p>
    <p n="6">Fifth , spirit , matter , and form truly represented , the more literal the translation the more satisfactory will be the result .</p>
    <p n="7">After all , translation is but a continuous effort after the impossible . There is in it a general difficulty whose root has a thousand ramifications , the whole affair being but an accommodation of difficulties , and a perfect translation from one language into another is a thing that cannot be effected . One is tempted even to say that in the whole range of speech there is no such thing as a synonym .</p>
    <p n="8">Much difficulty arises from the comparative paucity in English of double , or feminine rimes . But I can remember only one case in which , yielding to impossibility , I have sacrificed the feminine rime : where one thing or another must go , the less valuable must be the victom .</p>
    <p n="9">But sometimes a whole passage has had to suffer that a specially poetic line might retain its character .</p>
    <p n="10">With regard to the Hymns to the Night and the Spiritual Songs of Friedrich von Hardenberg , commonly called Novalis , it is desirable to mention that they were written when the shadow of the death of his betrothed had begun to thin before the approaching dawn of his own new life . He died in 1801 , at the age of twentynine . His parents belonged to the sect called Moravians , but he had become a Roman Catholic .</p>
    <p n="11">Perhaps some of Luther 's Songs might as well have been omitted , but they are all translated that the Songbook might be a whole . Some , I cannot tell how many or which , are from the Latin . His work is rugged , and where an occasional fault in rime occurs I have reproduced it .</p>
    <p n="12">In the few poems from the Italian , I have found the representation of the feminine rimes , so frequent in that language , an impossibility .</p>

   <p>HYMNS TO THE NIGHT .</p>
    <p>I .</p>
   <p>Before all the wondrous shows of the widespread space around him , what living , sentient thing loves not the all-joyous light , with its colours , its rays and undulations , its gentle omnipresence in the form of the wakening Day ? The giant world of the unresting constellations inhales it as the innermost soul of life , and floats dancing in its azure flood ; the sparkling , ever-tranquil stone , the thoughtful , imbibing plant , and the wild , burning , multiform beast-world inhales it ; but more than all , the lordly stranger with the meaning eyes , the swaying walk , and the sweetly closed , melodious lips . Like a king over earthly nature , it rouses every force to countless transformations , binds and unbinds innumerable alliances , hangs its heavenly form around every earthly substance . Its presence alone reveals the marvellous splendour of the kingdoms of the world .</p>
   <p>Aside I turn to the holy , unspeakable , mysterious Night . Afar lies the world , sunk in a deep grave ; waste and lonely is its place . In the chords of the bosom blows a deep sadness . I am ready to sink away in drops of dew , and mingle with the ashes .— The distances of memory , the wishes of youth , the dreams of childhood , the brief joys and vain hopes of a whole long life , arise in gray garments , like an evening vapour after the sunset . In other regions the light has pitched its joyous tents : what if it should never return to its children , who wait for it with the faith of innocence ?</p>
   <p>What springs up all at once so sweetly boding in my heart , and stills the soft air of sadness ? Dost thou also take a pleasure in us , dusky Night ? What holdest thou under thy mantle , that with hidden power affects my soul ? Precious balm drips from thy hand out of its bundle of poppies . Thou upliftest the heavy-laden pinions of the soul . Darkly and inexpressibly are we moved : joy-startled , I see a grave countenance that , tender and worshipful , inclines toward me , and , amid manifold entangled locks , reveals the youthful loveliness of the Mother . How poor and childish a thing seems to me now the light ! how joyous and welcome the departure of the day !— Didst thou not only therefore , because the Night turns away from thee thy servants , strew in the gulfs of space those flashing globes , to proclaim , in seasons of thy absence , thy omnipotence , and thy return ?</p>
   <p>More heavenly than those glittering stars we hold the eternal eyes which the Night hath opened within us . Farther they see than the palest of those countless hosts . Needing no aid from the light , they penetrate the depths of a loving soul that fills a loftier region with bliss ineffable . Glory to the queen of the world , to the great prophetess of holier worlds , to the foster-mother of blissful love ! she sends thee to me , thou tenderly beloved , the gracious sun of the Night . Now am I awake , for now am I thine and mine . Thou hast made me know the Night , and brought her to me to be my life ; thou hast made of me a man . Consume my body with the ardour of my soul , that I , turned to finer air , may mingle more closely with thee , and then our bridal night endure for ever .</p>
   <p>II .</p>
   <p>Must the morning always return ? Will the despotism of the earthly never cease ? Unholy activity consumes the angel-visit of the Night . Will the time never come when Love 's hidden sacrifice shall burn eternally ? To the Light a season was set ; but everlasting and boundless is the dominion of the Night . Endless is the duration of sleep . Holy Sleep , gladden not too seldom in this earthly day-labour , the devoted servant of the Night . Fools alone mistake thee , knowing nought of sleep but the shadow which , in the gloaming of the real night , thou pitifully castest over us . They feel thee not in the golden flood of the grapes , in the magic oil of the almond tree , and the brown juice of the poppy . They know not that it is thou who hauntest the bosom of the tender maiden , and makest a heaven of her lap ; never suspect it is thou , the portress of heaven , that steppest to meet them out of ancient stories , bearing the key to the dwellings of the blessed , silent messenger of secrets infinite .</p>
    <p>III .</p>
   <p>Once when I was shedding bitter tears , when , dissolved in pain , my hope was melting away , and I stood alone by the barren hillock which in its narrow dark bosom hid the vanished form of my Life , lonely as never yet was lonely man , driven by anguish unspeakable , powerless , and no longer aught but a conscious misery ;— as there I looked about me for help , unable to go on or to turn back , and clung to the fleeting , extinguished life with an endless longing : then , out of the blue distances , from the hills of my ancient bliss , came a shiver of twilight , and at once snapped the bond of birth , the fetter of the Light . Away fled the glory of the world , and with it my mourning ; the sadness flowed together into a new , unfathomable world . Thou , soul of the Night , heavenly Slumber , didst come upon me ; the region gently upheaved itself , and over it hovered my unbound , new-born spirit . The hillock became a cloud of dust , and through the cloud I saw the glorified face of my beloved . In her eyes eternity reposed . I laid hold of her hands , and the tears became a sparkling chain that could not be broken . Into the distance swept by , like a tempest , thousands of years . On her neck I welcomed the new life with ecstatic tears . Never was such another dream ; then first and ever since I hold fast an eternal , unchangeable faith in the heaven of the Night , and its sun , the Beloved .</p>
   <p>IV .</p>
   <p>Now I know when will come the last morning : when the light no more scares away the Night and Love , when sleep shall be without waking , and but one continuous dream . I feel in me a celestial exhaustion . Long and weariful was my pilgrimage to the holy grave , and crushing was the cross . The crystal wave , which , imperceptible to the ordinary sense , springs in the dark bosom of the hillock against whoose foot breaks the flood of the world , he who has tasted it , he who has stood on the mountain frontier of the world , and looked across into the new land , into the abode of the Night , verily he turns not again into the tumult of the world , into the land where dwells the Light in ceaseless unrest .</p>
   <p>On those heights he builds for himself tabernacles — tabernacles of peace ; there longs and loves and gazes across , until the welcomest of all hours draws him down into the waters of the spring . Afloat above remains what is earthly , and is swept back in storms ; but what became holy by the touch of Love , runs free through hidden ways to the region beyond , where , like odours , it mingles with love asleep . Still wakest thou , cheerful Light , the weary man to his labour , and into me pourest gladsome life ; but thou wilest me not away from Memory 's mossgrown monument . Gladly will I bestir the deedy hands , everywhere behold where thou hast need of me ; bepraise the rich pomp of thy splendour ; pursue unwearied the lovely harmonies of thy skilled handicraft ; gladly contemplate the thoughtful pace of thy mighty , radiant clock ; explore the balance of the forces and the laws of the wondrous play of countless worlds and their seasons ; but true to the Night remains my secret heart , and to creative Love , her daughter . Canst thou show me a heart eternally true ? Has thy sun friendly eyes that know me ? Do thy stars lay hold of my longing hand ? Do they return me the tender pressure and the caressing word ? Was it thou didst bedeck them with colours and a flickering outline ? Or was it she who gave to thy jewels a higher , a dearer significance ? What delight , what pleasure offers thy life , to outweigh the transports of Death ? Wears not everything that inspirits us the livery of the Night ? Thy mother , it is she who brings thee forth , and to her thou owest all thy glory . Thou wouldst vanish into thyself , thou wouldst dissipate in boundless space , if she did not hold thee fast , if she swaddled thee not , so that thou grewest warm , and , flaming , gavest birth to the universe . Verily I was before thou wast ; the mother sent me with my sisters to inhabit thy world , to sanctify it with love that it might be an ever present memorial , to plant it with flowers unfading . As yet they have not ripened , these thoughts divine ; as yet is there small trace of our coming apocalypse . One day thy clock will point to the end of Time , and then thou shalt be as one of us , and shalt , full of ardent longing , be extinguished and die . I feel in me the close of thy activity , I taste heavenly freedom , and happy restoration . With wild pangs I recognize thy distance from our home , thy feud with the ancient lordly Heaven . Thy rage and thy raving are in vain . Inconsumable stands the cross , victory-flag of our race .</p>

   <p>V .</p>
   <p>In ancient times an iron Fate lorded it , with dumb force , over the widespread families of men . A gloomy oppression swathed their anxious souls : the Earth was boundless , the abode of the gods and their home . From eternal ages stood its mysterious structure . Beyond the red hills of the morning , in the sacred bosom of the sea , dwelt the sun , the all-enkindling , live luminary . An aged giant upbore the happy world . Prisoned beneath mountains lay the first-born sons of mother Earth , helpless in their destroying fury against the new , glorious race of gods , and their kindred , glad-hearted men . Ocean 's dusky , green abyss was the lap of a goddess . In the crystal grottoes revelled a wanton folk . Rivers , trees , flowers , and beasts had human wits . Sweeter tasted the wine , poured out by youth impersonated ; a god was in the grape-clusters ; a loving , motherly goddess upgrew in the full golden sheaves ; love 's sacred carousal was a sweet worship of the fairest of the goddesses . Life revelled through the centuries like one spring-time , an ever-variegated festival of the children of heaven and the dwellers on the earth . All races childlike adored the ethereal , thousandfold flame , as the one sublimest thing in the world .</p>
   <p>It was but a fancy , a horrible dream-shape —</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">That fearsome to the merry tables strode ,</l>
     <l n="2">And wrapt the spirit in wild consternation .</l>
     <l n="3">The gods themselves here counsel knew nor showed</l>
     <l n="4">To fill the stifling heart with consolation .</l>
     <l n="5">Mysterious was the monster 's pathless road ,</l>
     <l n="6">Whoose rage would heed no prayer and no oblation ;</l>
     <l n="7">Twas Death who broke the banquet up with fears ,</l>
     <l n="8">With anguish , with dire pain , and bitter tears .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Eternally from all things here disparted</l>
     <l n="10">That sway the heart with pleasure 's joyous flow ,</l>
     <l n="11">Divided from the loved , whom , broken-hearted ,</l>
     <l n="12">Vain longing tosses and unceasing woe —</l>
     <l n="13">In a dull dream to struggle , faint and thwarted ,</l>
     <l n="14">Smeemed all was granted to the dead below !</l>
     <l n="15">Broke lay the merry wave of human glory</l>
     <l n="16">On Death 's inevitable promontory .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">With daring flight , aloft Thought 's pinions sweep ;</l>
     <l n="18">The horrid thing with beauty 's robe men cover :</l>
     <l n="19">A gentle youth puts out his torch , to sleep ;</l>
     <l n="20">Sweet comes the end , like moaning lute of lover .</l>
     <l n="21">Cool shadow-floods o'er melting memory creep :</l>
     <l n="22">So sang the song , for Misery was the mover .</l>
     <l n="23">Still undeciphered lay the endless Night —</l>
     <l n="24">The solemn symbol of a far-off Might .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The old world began to decline . The pleasure-garden of the young race withered away ; up into opener regions and desolate , forsaking his childhood , struggled the growing man . The gods vanished with their retinue . Nature stood alone and lifeless . Dry Number and rigid Measure bound her with iron chains . As into dust and air the priceless blossoms of life fell away in words obscure . Gone was wonder-working Faith , and the all-transforming , all-uniting angel-comrade , the Imagination . A cold north wind blew unkindly over the torpid plain , and the wonderland first froze , then evaporated into aether . The far depths of heaven filled with flashing worlds . Into the deeper sanctuary , into the more exalted region of the mind , the soul of the world retired with all her powers , there to rule until the dawn should break of the glory universal . No longer was the Light the abode of the gods , and the heavenly token of their presence : they cast over them the veil of the Night . The Night became the mighty womb of revelations ; into it the gods went back , and fell asleep , to go abroad in new and more glorious shapes over the transfigured world . Among the people which , untimely ripe , was become of all the most scornful and insolently hostile to the blessed innocence of youth , appeared the New World , in guise never seen before , in the song-favouring hut of poverty , a son of the first maid and mother , the eternal fruit of mysterious embrace . The forseeing , rich-blossoming wisdom of the East at once recognized the beginning of the new age ; a star showed it the way to the lowly cradle of the king . In the name of the far-reaching future , they did him homage with lustre ond odour , the highest wonders of Nature . In solitude the heavenly heart unfolded itself to a flower-chalice of almighty love , upturned to the supreme face of the father , and resting on the bliss-boding bosom of the sweetly solemn mother . With deifying fervour the prophetic eye of the blooming child beheld the years to come , foresaw , untroubled over the earthly lot of his own days , the beloved offspring of his divine stem . Ere long the most childlike souls , by true love marvellously possessed , gathered about him . Like flowers sprang up a new strange life in his presence . Words inexhaustible and tidings the most joyful fell like sparks of a divine spirit from his friendly lips . From a far shore came a singer , born under the clear sky of Hellas , to Palestine , and gave up his whole heart to the marvellous child :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The youth art thou who ages long hast stood</l>
     <l n="2">Upon our graves , lost in a maze of weening ;</l>
     <l n="3">Sign in the darkness of God 's tidings good ,</l>
     <l n="4">Whence hints of growth humanity is gleaning ;</l>
     <l n="5">For that we long , on that we sweetly brood</l>
     <l n="6">Which erst in woe had lost all life and meaning ;</l>
     <l n="7">In everlasting life death found its goal ,</l>
     <l n="8">For thou art Death , and thou first mak'st us whole .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Filled with joy , the singer went on to Indostan , his heart intoxicated with sweetest love , and poured it out in fiery songs under that tender sky , so that a thousand hearts bowed to him , and the good news sprang up with a thousand branches . Soon after the singer 's departure , his precious life was made a sacrifice for the deep fall of man . He died in his youth , torn away from his loved world , from his weeping mother , and his trembling friends . His lovely mouth emptied the dark cup of unspeakable wrongs . In horrible anguish the birth of the new world drew near . Hard he wrestled with the terrors of old Death ; heavy lay the weight of the old world upon him . Yet once more he looked kindly at his mother ; then came the releasing hand of the Love eternal , and he fell asleep . Only a few days hung a deep veil over the roaring sea , over the quaking land ; countless tears wept his loved ones ; the mystery was unsealed : heavenely spirits heaved the ancient stone from the gloomy grave . Angels sat by the sleeper , sweetly outbodied from his dreams ; awaked in new Godlike glory , he clomb the apex of the new-born world , buried with his own hand the old corpse in the forsaken cavity , and with hand almighty laid upon it the stone which no power shall again upheave .</p>
   <p>Yet weep thy loved ones over thy grave tears of joy , tears of emotion , tears of endless thanksgiving ; ever afresh , with joyous start , see thee rise again , and themselves with thee ; behold thee weep with soft fervour on the blessed bosom of thy mother , walk in thoughtful communion with thy friends , uttering words plucked as from the tree of life ; see thee hasten , full of longing , into thy father 's arms , bearing with thee youthful Humanity , and the inexhaustible cup of the golden Future . Soon the mother hastened after thee in heavenly triumph ; she was the first with thee in the new home . Since then , long ages have flowed past , and in splendour ever increasing hath bestirred itself thy new creation , and thousands have , out of pangs and tortures , followed thee , filled with faith and longing and truth , and are walking about with thee and the heavenly virgin in the kingdom of Love , minister in the temple of heavenly Death , and are for ever thine .</p>

    <head>A PARABLE .</head>
    <head>Long ago , there lived far to the west a very young man , good , but extremely odd . He tormented himself continually about this nothing and that nothing , always walked in silence and straight before him , sat down alone when the others were at their sports and merry-makings , and brooded over strange things . Caves and woods were his dearest haunts ; and there he talked on and on with beasts and birds , with trees and rocks — of course not one rational word , but mere idiotic stuff , to make one laugh to death . He continued , however , always moody and serious , in spite of the utmost pains that the squirrel , the monkey , the parrot , and the bullfinch could take to divert him , and set him in the right way . The goose told stories , the brook jingled a ballad between , a great thick stone cut ridiculous capers , the rose stole lovingly about him from behind and crept through his locks , while the ivy stroked his troubled brow . But his melancholy and gravity were stubborn . His parents were much troubled , and did not know what to do . He was in good health , and ate well enough ; they had never caused him any offence ; and , until a few years ago , he had been the liveliest and merriest of them all , foremost in all their games , and a favourite with all the maidens . He was very handsome , looked like a picture , and danced like an angel . Amongst the maidens was one , a charming and beautiful creature , who looked like wax , had hair like golden silk , and cherry-red lips , was a doll for size , and had coal-black , yes , raven-black eyes . Whoever saw her was ready to swoon , she was so lovely . Now Rosebud , for that was her name , was heartily fond of the handsome Hyacinth , for that was his name , and he loved her fit to die . The other children knew nothing of it . A violet told them of it first . The little house-cats had been quite aware of it , for the houses of their parents lay near each other . So when Hyacinth stood at night by his window , and Rosebud at hers , and the cats ran past mouse-hunting , they saw the two standing there , and often laughed and tittered so loud that they heard it and were offended . The violet told it in confidence to the strawberry , and she told it to her friend , the raspberry , who never ceased rasping when Hyacinth came along ; so that by and by the whole garden and wood were in the secret , and when Hyacinth went out , he heard on all sides the cry : “ Little Rosy is my posy ! ” This vexed him ; but the next moment he could not help laughing from the bottom of his heart , when the little lizard came slipping along , sat down on a warm stone , waggled his tail , and sang —</head>
     <l n="1">“ Little Rosebud , good and wise ,</l>
     <l n="2">All at once has lost her eyes :</l>
     <l n="3">Taking Hyacinth for her mother ,</l>
     <l n="4">Round his neck her arms she flings ;</l>
     <l n="5">Then perceiving ‘ tis another —</l>
     <l n="6">Starts with terror ?— no , but clings —</l>
     <l n="7">Think of that !— fast as before ,</l>
     <l n="8">Only kissing all the more ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Alas , how soon was the grand time over ! There came a man out of strange lands , who had travelled wondrous far and wide , had a long beard , deep eyes , frightful eyebrows , and a strange garment with many folds , and inwoven with curious figures . He seated himself before the house of Hyacinth 's parents . Hyacinth at once became very inquisitive , and sat down beside him , and brought him bread and wine . Then parted he his white beard , and told stories deep into the night ; and Hyacinth never stirred or tired of listening . This much they learned afterward , that he talked a great deal about strange lands , unknown countries , and amazingly wonderful things ; stopped there three days , and crept with Hyacinth down into deep shafts . Little Rosebud execrated the old sorcerer pretty thoroughly , for Hyacinth was altogether absorbed in his conversation , and paid no heed to anything else , hardly even to the swallowing of a mouthful of food . At length the man took his departure , but left with Hyacinth a little book which no man could read . Hyacinth gave him fruit , and bread , and wine to take with him , and accompanied him a long way . Then he came back sunk in thought , and thereafter took up a quite new mode of life . Rosebud was in a very sad way about him , for from that time forward he made little of her , and kept himself always to himself . But it came to pass that one day he came home , and was like one born again . He fell on his parents ’ neck and wept . “ I must away to a foreign land ! ” he said : “ the strange old woman in the wood has told me what I must do to get well ; she has thrown the book into the fire , and has made me come to you to ask your blessing . Perhaps I shall be back soon , perhaps never more . Say good-bye to Rosebud for me . I should have been glad to have a talk with her ; I do not know what has come to me : I must go ! When I would think to recall old times , immediately come thoughts more potent in between ; my rest is gone , and my heart and love with it ; and I must go find them ! I would gladly tell you whither , but do not myself know ; it is where dwells the mother of things , the virgin with the veil ; for her my spirit is on fire . Farewell ! ” He tore himself from them , and went out . His parents lamented and shed tears . Rosebud kept her chamber , and wept bitterly .</p>
   <p>Hyacinth now ran , as fast as he could , through valleys and wildernesses , over mountains and streams , toward the land of mystery . Everywhere he inquired — of men and beasts , of rocks and trees ,— after the sacred goddess Isis . Many laughed , many held their peace ; nowhere did he get an answer . At first he passed through a rugged wild country ; mists and clouds threw themselves in his way , but he rushed on impetuously . Then he came to boundless deserts of sand — mere glowing dust ; and as he went his mood changed also ; the time became tedious to him , and his inward unrest abated ; he grew gentler , and the stormy impulse in him passed by degrees into a mild yet powerful attraction , wherein his whole spirit was dissolved . It seemed as if many years lay behind him .</p>
   <p>And now the country became again richer and more varied , the air soft and blue , the way smoother . Green bushes enticed him with their pleasant shadows , but he did not understand their speech ; they seemed indeed not to speak , and yet they filled his heart with their green hues , and their cool , still presence . Ever higher in him waxed that same sweet longing , and ever broader and juicier grew the leaves , ever louder and more jocund the birds and beasts , balmier the fruits , darker the heavenly blue , warmer the air , and more ardent his love . The time went ever faster , as if it knew itself near the goal .</p>
   <p>One day he met a crystal rivulet , and a multitude of flowers , coming down into a valley between dark , columnar cliffs . They greeted him friendlily , with familiar words . “ Dear country-folk , ” said he , “ where shall I find the sacred dwelling of Isis ? Hereabouts it must be , and here , I guess , you are more at home than I . ” “ We also are but passing through , ” replied the flowers ; “ a spirit-family is on its travels , and we are preparing for them their road and quarters . A little way back , however , we passed through a country where we heard her name mentioned . Only go up , where we came down , and thou wilt soon learn more . ” The flowers and the brook smiled as they said it , offered him a cool draught , and went on their way . Hyacinth followed their counsel , kept asking , and came at last to that dwelling he had sought so long , which lay hid among palms and other rare plants . His heart beat with an infinite longing , and the sweetest apprehension thrilled him in this abode of the eternal seasons . Amid heavenly odours he fell asleep , for Dream alone could lead him into the holy of holies . In marvellous mode Dream conducted him through endless rooms full of strange things , by means of witching sounds and changeful harmonies . All seemed to him so familiar , and yet strange with an unknown splendour ; then vanished the last film of the perishable as if melted into air , and he stood before the celestial virgin . Then he lifted the thin glistening veil , and — Rosebud sank into his arms . A far-off music surrounded the mysteries of love 's reunion and the outpouring of their longings , and shut out from the scene of their rapture everything alien to it .</p>
   <p>Hyacinth lived a long time after with Rosebud and his happy parents and old playmates ; and numberless grandchildren thanked the wonderful old wise woman for her counsel and her uprousing ; for in those days people had as many children as they pleased .</p>

     <l n="8">Words better and freer flow apace ;</l>

     <l n="22">Round which so many brains are twirled —</l>
     <l n="23">For in the head it seems so easy !</l>
     <l n="24">And with it his thoughts were often busy ;</l>
     <l n="25">Therefore the finding was much too mean ;</l>
     <l n="26">Crown and sceptre it should have been !</l>
     <l n="27">He was not one his back to bow</l>

     <l n="34">But when they reach the city-gate ,</l>
     <l n="35">He goes up to a blacksmith 's door ,</l>

     <l n="42">Up in his sleeve did quietly lay .</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="43">Now , from the other gate , they trod</l>
     <l n="44">Through fields and meads a housless road ;</l>
     <l n="45">The path of trees was desolate ,</l>
     <l n="46">The sun shone out , the heat was great ;</l>
     <l n="47">So that one in a region such</l>
     <l n="48">For a drink of water had given much .</l>
     <l n="49">The Lord goes ever before them all ,</l>
     <l n="50">And as by chance lets a cherry fall :</l>

     <l n="52">As if a golden apple it were !</l>
     <l n="53">Sweet to his palate was the berry .</l>
     <l n="54">Then by and by , another cherry</l>
     <l n="55">Down on the ground the Master sends ,</l>
     <l n="56">For which St. Peter as quickly bends .</l>
     <l n="57">So , many a time , the Lord doth let</l>
     <l n="58">Him bend his back a cherry to get .</l>
     <l n="59">A long time thus He let him glean ;</l>
     <l n="60">Then said the Lord , with look serene :</l>
     <l n="61">“ If at the right time thou hadst bent ,</l>
     <l n="62">Thou hadst found it more convenient !</l>
     <l n="63">Of little things who little doth make</l>

     <l n="28">Stood in the rich light , golden showing .</l>
     <l n="29">The clouds around it , sunny-clear ,</l>
     <l n="30">Seemed bearing it aloft like pinions ;</l>

     <l n="36">A dumb storm made it swing and shiver .</l>
     <l n="37">It seemed to heave my throbbing breast ,</l>
     <l n="38">That heavenly storm with torrent blended :</l>

     <l n="44">With forms of all the martyrs sainted .</l>

     <l n="46">Form swell to life and break its barriers ;</l>

     <l n="52">Was painted Heaven 's resplendent pageant ;</l>
     <l n="53">But when again I lift mine eyes ,</l>
     <l n="54">Lo , the high vault has flown asunder !</l>
     <l n="55">The upward gate wide open lies ,</l>
     <l n="56">And every veil unveils a wonder .</l>

     <l n="57">What gloriousness I then beheld</l>
     <l n="58">With silent worship , speechless wonder ;</l>
     <l n="59">What blessed sounds upon me swelled ,</l>
     <l n="60">Like organs ’ and like trumpets ’ thunder —</l>
     <l n="61">No human words could ever tell !—</l>
     <l n="62">But who for such is sighing sorest ,</l>
     <l n="63">Let him give heed unto the bell</l>
     <l n="64">That dimly soundeth in the forest .</l>
