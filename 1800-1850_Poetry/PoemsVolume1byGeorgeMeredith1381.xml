    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Chillanwallah , Chillanwallah !</l>
     <l n="2">Where our brothers fought and bled ,</l>
     <l n="3">O thy name is natural music</l>
     <l n="4">And a dirge above the dead !</l>
     <l n="5">Though we have not been defeated ,</l>
     <l n="6">Though we can n't be overcome ,</l>
     <l n="7">Still , whene'er thou art repeated ,</l>
     <l n="8">I would fain that grief were dumb .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Chillianwallah , Chillianwallah !</l>
     <l n="10">‘ Tis a name so sad and strange ,</l>
     <l n="11">Like a breeze through midnight harpstrings</l>
     <l n="12">Ringing many a mournful change ;</l>
     <l n="13">But the wildness and the sorrow</l>
     <l n="14">Have a meaning of their own -</l>
     <l n="15">Oh , whereof no glad to-morrow</l>
     <l n="16">Can relieve the dismal tone !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Chillianwallah , Chillianwallah !</l>
     <l n="18">‘ Tis a village dark and low ,</l>
     <l n="19">By the bloody Jhelum river</l>
     <l n="20">Bridged by the foreboding foe ;</l>
     <l n="21">And across the wintry water</l>
     <l n="22">He is ready to retreat ,</l>
     <l n="23">When the carnage and the slaughter</l>
     <l n="24">Shall have paid for his defeat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">Chillianwallah , Chillianwallah !</l>
     <l n="26">‘ Tis a wild and dreary plain ,</l>
     <l n="27">Strewn with plots of thickest jungle ,</l>
     <l n="28">Matted with the gory stain .</l>
     <l n="29">There the murder-mouthed artillery ,</l>
     <l n="30">In the deadly ambuscade ,</l>
     <l n="31">Wrought the thunder of its treachery</l>
     <l n="32">On the skeleton brigade .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">Chillianwallah , Chillianwallah !</l>
     <l n="34">When the night set in with rain ,</l>
     <l n="35">Came the savage plundering devils</l>
     <l n="36">To their work among the slain ;</l>
     <l n="37">And the wounded and the dying</l>
     <l n="38">In cold blood did share the doom</l>
     <l n="39">Of their comrades round them lying ,</l>
     <l n="40">Stiff in the dead skyless gloom .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">Chillianwallah , Chillianwallah !</l>
     <l n="42">Thou wilt be a doleful chord ,</l>
     <l n="43">And a mystic note of mourning</l>
     <l n="44">That will need no chiming word ;</l>
     <l n="45">And that heart will leap with anguish</l>
     <l n="46">Who may understand thee best ;</l>
     <l n="47">But the hopes of all will languish</l>
     <l n="48">Till thy memory is at rest .</l>

     <l n="49">THE DOE : A FRAGMENT ( From ‘ WANDERING WILLIE ’ )</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="50">And — ‘ Yonder look ! yoho ! yoho !</l>
     <l n="51">Nancy is off ! ’ the farmer cried ,</l>
     <l n="52">Advancing by the river side ,</l>
     <l n="53">Red-kerchieft and brown-coated ;— ‘ So ,</l>
     <l n="54">My girl , who else could leap like that ?</l>
     <l n="55">So neatly ! like a lady ! ‘ Zounds !</l>
     <l n="56">Look at her how she leads the hounds ! ’</l>
     <l n="57">And waving his dusty beaver hat ,</l>
     <l n="58">He cheered across the chase-filled water ,</l>
     <l n="59">And clapt his arm about his daughter ,</l>
     <l n="60">And gave to Joan a courteous hug ,</l>
     <l n="61">And kiss that , like a stubborn plug</l>
     <l n="62">From generous vats in vastness rounded ,</l>
     <l n="63">The inner wealth and spirit sounded :</l>
     <l n="64">Eagerly pointing South , where , lo ,</l>
     <l n="65">The daintiest , fleetest-footed doe</l>
     <l n="66">Led o'er the fields and thro ’ the furze</l>
     <l n="67">Beyond : her lively delicate ears</l>
     <l n="68">Prickt up erect , and in her track</l>
     <l n="69">A dappled lengthy-striding pack .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="70">Scarce had they cast eyes upon her ,</l>
     <l n="71">When every heart was wagered on her ,</l>
     <l n="72">And half in dread , and half delight ,</l>
     <l n="73">They watched her lovely bounding flight ;</l>
     <l n="74">As now across the flashing green ,</l>
     <l n="75">And now beneath the stately trees ,</l>
     <l n="76">And now far distant in the dene ,</l>
     <l n="77">She headed on with graceful ease :</l>
     <l n="78">Hanging aloft with doubled knees ,</l>
     <l n="79">At times athwart some hedge or gate ;</l>
     <l n="80">And slackening pace by slow degrees ,</l>
     <l n="81">As for the foremost foe to wait .</l>
     <l n="82">Renewing her outstripping rate</l>
     <l n="83">Whene'er the hot pursuers neared ,</l>
     <l n="84">By garden wall and paled estate ,</l>
     <l n="85">Where clambering gazers whooped and cheered .</l>
     <l n="86">Here winding under elm and oak ,</l>
     <l n="87">And slanting up the sunny hill :</l>
     <l n="88">Splashing the water here like smoke</l>
     <l n="89">Among the mill-holms round the mill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="90">And — ‘ Let her go ; she shows her game ,</l>
     <l n="91">My Nancy girl , my pet and treasure ! ’</l>
     <l n="92">The farmer sighed : his eyes with pleasure</l>
     <l n="93">Brimming : ‘'Tis my daughter 's name ,</l>
     <l n="94">My second daughter lying yonder . ’</l>
     <l n="95">And Willie 's eye in search did wander ,</l>
     <l n="96">And caught at once , with moist regard ,</l>
     <l n="97">The white gleams of a grey churchyard .</l>
     <l n="98">‘ Three weeks before my girl had gone ,</l>
     <l n="99">And while upon her pillows propped ,</l>
     <l n="100">She lay at eve ; the weakling fawn -</l>
     <l n="101">For still it seems a fawn just dropt</l>
     <l n="102">A se'nnight — to my Nancy 's bed</l>
     <l n="103">I brought to make my girl a gift :</l>
     <l n="104">The mothers of them both were dead :</l>
     <l n="105">And both to bless it was my drift ,</l>
     <l n="106">By giving each a friend ; not thinking</l>
     <l n="107">How rapidly my girl was sinking .</l>
     <l n="108">And I remember how , to pat</l>
     <l n="109">Its neck , she stretched her hand so weak ,</l>
     <l n="110">And its cold nose against her cheek</l>
     <l n="111">Pressed fondly : and I fetched the mat</l>
     <l n="112">To make it up a couch just by her ,</l>
     <l n="113">Where in the lone dark hours to lie :</l>
     <l n="114">For neither dear old nurse nor I</l>
     <l n="115">Would any single wish deny her .</l>
     <l n="116">And there unto the last it lay ;</l>
     <l n="117">And in the pastures cared to play</l>
     <l n="118">Little or nothing : there its meals</l>
     <l n="119">And milk I brought : and even now</l>
     <l n="120">The creature such affection feels</l>
     <l n="121">For that old room that , when and how ,</l>
     <l n="122">‘ Tis strange to mark , it slinks and steals</l>
     <l n="123">To get there , and all day conceals .</l>
     <l n="124">And once when nurse who , since that time ,</l>
     <l n="125">Keeps house for me , was very sick ,</l>
     <l n="126">Waking upon the midnight chime ,</l>
     <l n="127">And listening to the stair-clock 's click ,</l>
     <l n="128">I heard a rustling , half uncertain ,</l>
     <l n="129">Close against the dark bed-curtain :</l>
     <l n="130">And while I thrust my leg to kick ,</l>
     <l n="131">And feel the phantom with my feet ,</l>
     <l n="132">A loving tongue began to lick</l>
     <l n="133">My left hand lying on the sheet ;</l>
     <l n="134">And warm sweet breath upon me blew ,</l>
     <l n="135">And that ‘ twas Nancy then I knew .</l>
     <l n="136">So , for her love , I had good cause</l>
     <l n="137">To have the creature “ Nancy ” christened . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="138">He paused , and in the moment 's pause ,</l>
     <l n="139">His eyes and Willie 's strangely glistened .</l>
     <l n="140">Nearer came Joan , and Bessy hung</l>
     <l n="141">With face averted , near enough</l>
     <l n="142">To hear , and sob unheard ; the young</l>
     <l n="143">And careless ones had scampered off</l>
     <l n="144">Meantime , and sought the loftiest place</l>
     <l n="145">To beacon the approaching chase .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="146">‘ Daily upon the meads to browse ,</l>
     <l n="147">Goes Nancy with those dairy cows</l>
     <l n="148">You see behind the clematis :</l>
     <l n="149">And such a favourite she is ,</l>
     <l n="150">That when fatigued , and helter skelter ,</l>
     <l n="151">Among them from her foes to shelter ,</l>
     <l n="152">She dashes when the chase is over ,</l>
     <l n="153">They 'll close her in and give her cover ,</l>
     <l n="154">And bend their horns against the hounds ,</l>
     <l n="155">And low , and keep them out of bounds !</l>
     <l n="156">From the house dogs she dreads no harm ,</l>
     <l n="157">And is good friends with all the farm ,</l>
     <l n="158">Man , and bird , and beast , howbeit</l>
     <l n="159">Their natures seem so opposite .</l>
     <l n="160">And she is known for many a mile ,</l>
     <l n="161">And noted for her splendid style ,</l>
     <l n="162">For her clear leap and quick slight hoof ;</l>
     <l n="163">Welcome she is in many a roof .</l>
     <l n="164">And if I say , I love her , man !</l>
     <l n="165">I say but little : her fine eyes full</l>
     <l n="166">Of memories of my girl , at Yule</l>
     <l n="167">And May-time , make her dearer than</l>
     <l n="168">Dumb brute to men has been , I think .</l>
     <l n="169">So dear I do not find her dumb .</l>
     <l n="170">I know her ways , her slightest wink ,</l>
     <l n="171">So well ; and to my hand she 'll come ,</l>
     <l n="172">Sidelong , for food or a caress ,</l>
     <l n="173">Just like a loving human thing .</l>
     <l n="174">Nor can I help , I do confess ,</l>
     <l n="175">Some touch of human sorrowing</l>
     <l n="176">To think there may be such a doubt</l>
     <l n="177">That from the next world she 'll be shut out ,</l>
     <l n="178">And parted from me ! And well I mind</l>
     <l n="179">How , when my girl 's last moments came ,</l>
     <l n="180">Her soft eyes very soft and kind ,</l>
     <l n="181">She joined her hands and prayed the same ,</l>
     <l n="182">That she “ might meet her father , mother ,</l>
     <l n="183">Sister Bess , and each dear brother ,</l>
     <l n="184">And with them , if it might be , one</l>
     <l n="185">Who was her last companion . ”</l>
     <l n="186">Meaning the fawn — the doe you mark -</l>
     <l n="187">For my bay mare was then a foal ,</l>
     <l n="188">And time has passed since then : -  but hark ! ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="189">For like the shrieking of a soul</l>
     <l n="190">Shut in a tomb , a darkened cry</l>
     <l n="191">Of inward-wailing agony</l>
     <l n="192">Surprised them , and all eyes on each</l>
     <l n="193">Fixed in the mute-appealing speech</l>
     <l n="194">Of self-reproachful apprehension :</l>
     <l n="195">Knowing not what to think or do :</l>
     <l n="196">But Joan , recovering first , broke through</l>
     <l n="197">The instantaneous suspension ,</l>
     <l n="198">And knelt upon the ground , and guessed</l>
     <l n="199">The bitterness at a glance , and pressed</l>
     <l n="200">Into the comfort of her breast</l>
     <l n="201">The deep-throed quaking shape that drooped</l>
     <l n="202">In misery 's wilful aggravation ,</l>
     <l n="203">Before the farmer as he stooped ,</l>
     <l n="204">Touched with accusing consternation :</l>
     <l n="205">Soothing her as she sobbed aloud : -</l>
     <l n="206">‘ Not me ! not me ! Oh , no , no , no !</l>
     <l n="207">Not me ! God will not take me in !</l>
     <l n="208">Nothing can wipe away my sin !</l>
     <l n="209">I shall not see her : you will go ;</l>
     <l n="210">You and all that she loves so :</l>
     <l n="211">Not me ! not me ! Oh , no , no , no ! ’</l>
     <l n="212">Colourless , her long black hair ,</l>
     <l n="213">Like seaweed in a tempest tossed</l>
     <l n="214">Tangling astray , to Joan 's care</l>
     <l n="215">She yielded like a creature lost :</l>
     <l n="216">Yielded , drooping toward the ground ,</l>
     <l n="217">As doth a shape one half-hour drowned ,</l>
     <l n="218">And heaved from sea with mast and spar ,</l>
     <l n="219">All dark of its immortal star .</l>
     <l n="220">And on that tender heart , inured</l>
     <l n="221">To flatter basest grief , and fight</l>
     <l n="222">Despair upon the brink of night ,</l>
     <l n="223">She suffered herself to sink , assured</l>
     <l n="224">Of refuge ; and her ear inclined</l>
     <l n="225">To comfort ; and her thoughts resigned</l>
     <l n="226">To counsel ; her wild hair let brush</l>
     <l n="227">From off her weeping brows ; and shook</l>
     <l n="228">With many little sobs that took</l>
     <l n="229">Deeper-drawn breaths , till into sighs ,</l>
     <l n="230">Long sighs , they sank ; and to the ‘ hush ! ’</l>
     <l n="231">Of Joan 's gentle chide , she sought</l>
     <l n="232">Childlike to check them as she ought ,</l>
     <l n="233">Looking up at her infantwise .</l>
     <l n="234">And Willie , gazing on them both ,</l>
     <l n="235">Shivered with bliss through blood and brain ,</l>
     <l n="236">To see the darling of his troth</l>
     <l n="237">Like a maternal angel strain</l>
     <l n="238">The sinful and the sinless child</l>
     <l n="239">At once on either breast , and there</l>
     <l n="240">In peace and promise reconciled</l>
     <l n="241">Unite them : nor could Nature 's care</l>
     <l n="242">With subtler sweet beneficence</l>
     <l n="243">Have fed the springs of penitence ,</l>
     <l n="244">Still keeping true , though harshly tried ,</l>
     <l n="245">The vital prop of human pride .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Swept from his fleet upon that fatal night</l>
     <l n="2">When great Poseidon 's sudden-veering wrath</l>
     <l n="3">Scattered the happy homeward-floating Greeks</l>
     <l n="4">Like foam-flakes off the waves , the King of Crete</l>
     <l n="5">Held lofty commune with the dark Sea-god .</l>
     <l n="6">His brows were crowned with victory , his cheeks</l>
     <l n="7">Were flushed with triumph , but the mighty joy</l>
     <l n="8">Of Troy 's destruction and his own great deeds</l>
     <l n="9">Passed , for the thoughts of home were dearer now ,</l>
     <l n="10">And sweet the memory of wife and child ,</l>
     <l n="11">And weary now the ten long , foreign years ,</l>
     <l n="12">And terrible the doubt of short delay -</l>
     <l n="13">More terrible , O Gods ! he cried , but stopped ;</l>
     <l n="14">Then raised his voice upon the storm and prayed .</l>
     <l n="15">O thou , if injured , injured not by me ,</l>
     <l n="16">Poseidon ! whom sea-deities obey</l>
     <l n="17">And mortals worship , hear me ! for indeed</l>
     <l n="18">It was our oath to aid the cause of Greece ,</l>
     <l n="19">Not unespoused by Gods , and most of all</l>
     <l n="20">By thee , if gentle currents , havens calm ,</l>
     <l n="21">Fair winds and prosperous voyage , and the Shape</l>
     <l n="22">Impersonate in many a perilous hour ,</l>
     <l n="23">Both in the stately councils of the Kings ,</l>
     <l n="24">And when the husky battle murmured thick ,</l>
     <l n="25">May testify of services performed !</l>
     <l n="26">But now the seas are haggard with thy wrath ,</l>
     <l n="27">Thy breath is tempest ! never at the shores</l>
     <l n="28">Of hostile Ilium did thy stormful brows</l>
     <l n="29">Betray such fierce magnificence ! not even</l>
     <l n="30">On that wild day when , mad with torch and glare ,</l>
     <l n="31">The frantic crowds with eyes like starving wolves</l>
     <l n="32">Burst from their ports impregnable , a stream</l>
     <l n="33">Of headlong fury toward the hissing deep ;</l>
     <l n="34">Where then full-armed I stood in guard , compact</l>
     <l n="35">Beside thee , and alone , with brand and spear ,</l>
     <l n="36">We held at bay the swarming brood , and poured</l>
     <l n="37">Blood of choice warriors on the foot-ploughed sands !</l>
     <l n="38">Thou , meantime , dark with conflict , as a cloud</l>
     <l n="39">That thickens in the bosom of the West</l>
     <l n="40">Over quenched sunset , circled round with flame ,</l>
     <l n="41">Huge as a billow running from the winds</l>
     <l n="42">Long distances , till with black shipwreck swoln ,</l>
     <l n="43">It flings its angry mane about the sky .</l>
     <l n="44">And like that billow heaving ere it burst ;</l>
     <l n="45">And like that cloud urged by impulsive storm</l>
     <l n="46">With charge of thunder , lightning , and the drench</l>
     <l n="47">Of torrents , thou in all thy majesty</l>
     <l n="48">Of mightiness didst fall upon the war !</l>
     <l n="49">Remember that great moment ! Nor forget</l>
     <l n="50">The aid I gave thee ; how my ready spear</l>
     <l n="51">Flew swiftly seconding thy mortal stroke ,</l>
     <l n="52">Where'er the press was hottest ; never slacked</l>
     <l n="53">My arm its duty , nor mine eye its aim ,</l>
     <l n="54">Though terribly they compassed us , and stood</l>
     <l n="55">Thick as an Autumn forest , whose brown hair ,</l>
     <l n="56">Lustrous with sunlight , by the still increase</l>
     <l n="57">Of heat to glowing heat conceives like zeal</l>
     <l n="58">Of radiance , till at the pitch of noon</l>
     <l n="59">‘ Tis seized with conflagration and distends</l>
     <l n="60">Horridly over leagues of doom 'd domain ;</l>

     <l n="62">The wail of creatures in the covert pent ,</l>
     <l n="63">Howls , yells , and shrieks of agony , the hiss</l>
     <l n="64">Of seething sap , and crash of falling boughs</l>
     <l n="65">Together in its dull voracious roar .</l>
     <l n="66">So closely and so fearfully they throng 'd ,</l>
     <l n="67">Savage with phantasies of victory ,</l>
     <l n="68">A sea of dusky shapes ; for day had passed</l>
     <l n="69">And night fell on their darkened faces , red</l>
     <l n="70">With fight and torchflare ; shrill the resonant air</l>
     <l n="71">With eager shouts , and hoarse with angry groans ;</l>
     <l n="72">While over all the dense and sullen boom ,</l>
     <l n="73">The din and murmur of the myriads ,</l>
     <l n="74">Rolled with its awful intervals , as though</l>
     <l n="75">The battle breathed , or as against the shore</l>
     <l n="76">Waves gather back to heave themselves anew .</l>
     <l n="77">That night sleep dropped not from the dreary skies ,</l>
     <l n="78">Nor could the prowess of our chiefs oppose</l>
     <l n="79">That sea of raging men . But what were they ?</l>
     <l n="80">Or what is man opposed to thee ? Its hopes</l>
     <l n="81">Are wrecks , himself the drowning , drifting weed</l>
     <l n="82">That wanders on thy waters ; such as I</l>
     <l n="83">Who see the scattered remnants of my fleet ,</l>
     <l n="84">Remembering the day when first we sailed ,</l>
     <l n="85">Each glad ship shining like the morning star</l>
     <l n="86">With promise for the world . Oh ! such as I</l>

     <l n="92">How dreadful ! Still my trust is fixed on thee</l>
     <l n="93">For those that still remain and for myself .</l>
     <l n="94">And if I hear thy swift foam-snorting steeds</l>

     <l n="184">Some proclamation from the regal fount ,</l>
     <l n="185">With eager questioning and anxious phrase</l>
     <l n="186">Betray the expectation of their hearts ,</l>

     <l n="189">In sullen groups and cloudy masses , stirred</l>
     <l n="190">With rage irresolute and whispering plot ,</l>
     <l n="191">Known more by indication than by word ,</l>
     <l n="192">And understood alone by those whose minds</l>

     <l n="202">Throughout his vast divinity the deeps</l>
     <l n="203">Concurrent thrilled with action , and away ,</l>
     <l n="204">As sweeps a thunder-cloud across the sky</l>
     <l n="205">In harvest-time , preluded by dull blasts ;</l>
     <l n="206">Or some black-visaged whirlwind , whose wide folds</l>

     <l n="208">Darkling he hurried , and his distant voice ,</l>
     <l n="209">Not softened by delay , was heard in tones</l>
     <l n="210">Distinctly terrible , still following up</l>
     <l n="211">Its rapid utterance of tremendous wrath</l>
     <l n="212">With hoarse reverberations ; like the roar</l>
     <l n="213">Of lions when they hunger , and awake</l>
     <l n="214">The sullen echoes from their forest sleep ,</l>
     <l n="215">To speed the ravenous noise from hill to hill</l>
     <l n="216">And startle victims ; but more awful , He ,</l>
     <l n="217">Scudding across the hills that rise and sink ,</l>
     <l n="218">With foam , and splash , and cataracts of spray ,</l>
     <l n="219">Clothed in majestic splendour ; girt about</l>
     <l n="220">With Sea-gods and swift creatures of the sea ;</l>
     <l n="221">Their briny eyes blind with the showering drops ;</l>
     <l n="222">Their stormy locks , salt tongues , and scaly backs ,</l>
     <l n="223">Quivering in harmony with the tempest , fierce</l>
     <l n="224">And eager with tempestuous delight ; -</l>
     <l n="225">He like a moving rock above them all</l>
     <l n="226">Solemnly towering while fitful gleams</l>
     <l n="227">Brake from his dense black forehead , which display 'd</l>

     <l n="229">Tossed , toiling with the waters , climbing high ,</l>
     <l n="230">And plunging downward with determined beaks ,</l>
     <l n="231">In lurid anguish ; but the Cretan king</l>
     <l n="232">And all his crew were ‘ ware of under-tides ,</l>
     <l n="233">That for the groaning vessel made a path ,</l>
     <l n="234">On which the impending and precipitous waves</l>

     <l n="239">And gushing of their weary hopes once more</l>
     <l n="240">Within their fond warm hearts , tired limbs , and eyes</l>
     <l n="241">Heavy with much fatigue and want of sleep !</l>
     <l n="242">Prayers did not lack ; like mountain springs they came ,</l>
     <l n="243">After the earth has drunk the drenching rains ,</l>
     <l n="244">And throws her fresh-born jets into the sun</l>
     <l n="245">With joyous sparkles ;— for there needed not</l>
     <l n="246">Evidence more serene of instant grace ,</l>
     <l n="247">Immortal mercy ! and the sense which follows</l>
     <l n="248">Divine interposition , when the shock</l>

     <l n="250">Visibly , and through supplication deep , -</l>

     <l n="252">Of him whose interceding vow had saved .</l>
     <l n="253">Tears from that great heroic soul sprang up ;</l>
     <l n="254">Not painful as in grief , nor smarting keen</l>
     <l n="255">With shame of weeping ; but calm , fresh , and sweet ;</l>
     <l n="256">Such as in lofty spirits rise , and wed</l>
     <l n="257">The nature of the woman to the man ;</l>
     <l n="258">A sight most lovely to the Gods ! They fell</l>
     <l n="259">Like showers of starlight from his steadfast eyes ,</l>
     <l n="260">As ever towards the prow he gazed , nor moved</l>
     <l n="261">One muscle , with firm lips and level lids ,</l>
     <l n="262">Motionless ; while the winds sang in his ears ,</l>
     <l n="263">And took the length of his brown hair in streams</l>
     <l n="264">Behind him . Thus the hours passed , and the oars</l>
     <l n="265">Plied without pause , and nothing but the sound</l>
     <l n="266">Of the dull rowlocks and still watery sough ,</l>
     <l n="267">Far off , the carnage of the storm , was heard .</l>
     <l n="268">For nothing spake the mariners in their toil ,</l>
     <l n="269">And all the captains of the war were dumb :</l>
     <l n="270">Too much oppressed with wonder , too much thrilled</l>
     <l n="271">By their great chieftain 's silence , to disturb</l>
     <l n="272">Such meditation with poor human speech .</l>
     <l n="273">Meantime the moon through slips of driving cloud</l>
     <l n="274">Came forth , and glanced athwart the seas a path</l>
     <l n="275">Of dusky splendour , like the Hadean brows ,</l>
     <l n="276">When with Elysian passion they behold</l>
     <l n="277">Persephone 's complacent hueless cheeks .</l>
     <l n="278">Soon gathering strength and lustre , as a ship</l>
     <l n="279">That swims into some blue and open bay</l>
     <l n="280">With bright full-bosomed sails , the radiant car</l>
     <l n="281">Of Artemis advanced , and on the waves</l>
     <l n="282">Sparkled like arrows from her silver bow</l>
     <l n="283">The keenness of her pure and tender gaze .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="284">Then , slowly , one by one the chiefs sought rest ;</l>

     <l n="286">The rowers at midseason . Fair it was</l>
     <l n="287">To see them as they lay ! Some up the prow ,</l>
     <l n="288">Some round the helm , in open-handed sleep ;</l>
     <l n="289">With casques unloosed , and bucklers put aside ;</l>
     <l n="290">The ten years ’ tale of war upon their cheeks ,</l>
     <l n="291">Where clung the salt wet locks , and on their breasts</l>
     <l n="292">Beards , the thick growth of many a proud campaign ;</l>
     <l n="293">And on their brows the bright invisible crown</l>
     <l n="294">Victory sheds from her own radiant form ,</l>
     <l n="295">As o'er her favourites ’ heads she sings and soars .</l>
     <l n="296">But dreams came not so calmly ; as around</l>

     <l n="299">Reign placid surfaces and solemn peace ,</l>
     <l n="300">So , from the troubled strands of memory , they</l>
     <l n="301">Launched and were tossed , long ere they found the tides</l>
     <l n="302">That lead to the gentle bosoms of pure rest .</l>
     <l n="303">And like to one who from a ghostly watch</l>
     <l n="304">In a lone house where murder hath been done ,</l>

     <l n="306">Emerges , staggering on the first chill gust</l>
     <l n="307">Wherewith the morning greets him , feeling not</l>
     <l n="308">Its balmy freshness on his bloodless cheek , -</l>

     <l n="314">In renovated senses lapt , and joins</l>
     <l n="315">The full , keen joyance of the day , so they</l>
     <l n="316">From sights and sounds of battle smeared with blood ,</l>
     <l n="317">And shrieking souls on Acheron 's bleak tides ,</l>
     <l n="318">And wail of execrating kindred , slid</l>

     <l n="370">Even now the dark inexorable deed</l>
     <l n="371">Is dealing its relentless stroke , and vain</l>
     <l n="372">Are prayers , and tears , and struggles , and despair !</l>
     <l n="373">The mother 's tears , the nation 's stormful grief ,</l>
     <l n="374">The people 's indignation and revenge !</l>
     <l n="375">Vain the last childlike pleading voice for life ,</l>
     <l n="376">The quick resolve , the young heroic brow ,</l>
     <l n="377">So like , so like , and vainly beautiful !</l>

     <l n="7">And it tumbles the rocks in boisterous play ,</l>
     <l n="8">With an earnest will to find its way .</l>
     <l n="9">Sharp it throws out an emerald shoulder ,</l>
     <l n="10">And , thundering ever of the mountain ,</l>
     <l n="11">Slaps in sport some giant boulder ,</l>
     <l n="12">And tops it in a silver fountain .</l>
     <l n="13">A chain of foam from end to end ,</l>
     <l n="14">And a solitude so deep , my friend ,</l>
     <l n="15">You may forget that man abides</l>
     <l n="16">Beyond the great mute mountain-sides .</l>
     <l n="17">Yet to me , in this high-walled solitude</l>
     <l n="18">Of river and rock and forest rude ,</l>
     <l n="19">The roaring voice through the long white chain</l>
     <l n="20">Is the voice of the world of bubble and brain .</l>
