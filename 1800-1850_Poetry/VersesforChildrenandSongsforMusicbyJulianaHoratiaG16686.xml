    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">It has been decided in publishing this volume to reproduce the illustrations with which the verses originally appeared in Aunt Judy 's Magazine . In all cases Mrs. Ewing wrote the lines to fit the pictures , and it is worthy of note to observe how closely she has introduced every detail into her words . Most of the woodcuts are by German artists , Oscar Pletsch , Fedor Flinzer , and others ; but the frontispiece is from an original sketch by Mr. Gordon Browne . In accordance with his special desire , it has only been used for Mrs. Ewing 's poem , as the Convalescent was a little friend of the artist , who did not live to complete his recovery . The poem is the last that Mrs. Ewing wrote for children , and it was penned when she herself was enduring the discomforts of convalescence with all the courage she so warmly advocates .</p>
    <p n="2">Mr. Randolph Caldecott 's illustrations to “ Mother 's Birthday Review ” first appeared in his Sketch Book , but the letterpress that accompanied them was very brief , and Mrs. Ewing could not resist asking permission to write some verses to the pictures , and publish them in Aunt Judy 's Magazine . This favour was kindly granted , and by Mrs. Caldecott 's further kindness the sketches are again used here .</p>
    <p n="3">The contents of this volume have been arranged chronologically as far as is possible .</p>
    <p n="4">“ The Willow Man ” and “ Grandmother 's Spring ” were both written to protest against wantonly wasting Dame Nature 's gifts , and the Note on page 69 shows that Mrs. Ewing had learnt this lesson herself in childhood . My Father has lately recalled an incident which he believes first roused our Mother to teach the lesson to us . They were driving to Sheffield one day , when on Bolsover Hill they saw a well-known veterinary surgeon of the district , Mr. Peech , who had dismounted from his horse , and was carefully taking up a few roots of white violets from a bank where they grew in some profusion . He showed Mrs. Gatty what he was gathering , but told her he was taking care to leave a bit behind . This happened fully forty years ago , long before the Selborne and other Societies for the preservation of rare plants and birds had come into existence , and Mother was much impressed and pleased by Mr. Peech 's delicate scrupulousness .</p>
    <p n="5">“ A Soldier 's Children ” was written in 1879 , whilst many friends were fighting in South Africa , and ten years before a story bearing the same name was issued by the writer of Bootles ’ Baby .</p>
    <p n="6">The “ Songs for Music ” appeared in 1874 in a volume called Songs by Four Friends , except the two last poems , “ Anemones ” and “ Autumn Tints . ” The former was given by Mrs. Ewing to her brother , Mr. Alfred Scott-Gatty , to set to music , and it has recently been published by Messrs. Boosey . “ Autumn Tints ” was found amongst Mrs. Ewing 's papers after her death , and is now printed for the first time .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Found in the garden — dead in his beauty .</l>
     <l n="2">Ah ! that a linnet should die in the spring !</l>
     <l n="3">Bury him , comrades , in pitiful duty ,</l>
     <l n="4">Muffle the dinner-bell , solemnly ring .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Bury him kindly — up in the corner ;</l>
     <l n="6">Bird , beast , and gold-fish are sepulchred there ;</l>
     <l n="7">Bid the black kitten march as chief mourner ,</l>
     <l n="8">Waving her tail like a plume in the air .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Bury him nobly — next to the donkey ;</l>
     <l n="10">Fetch the old banner , and wave it about :</l>
     <l n="11">Bury him deeply — think of the monkey ,</l>
     <l n="12">Shallow his grave , and the dogs got him out .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Bury him softly — white wool around him ,</l>
     <l n="14">Kiss his poor feathers ,— the first kiss and last ;</l>
     <l n="15">Tell his poor widow kind friends have found him :</l>
     <l n="16">Plant his poor grave with whatever grows fast .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Farewell , sweet singer ! dead in thy beauty ,</l>
     <l n="18">Silent through summer , though other birds sing ;</l>
     <l n="19">Bury him , comrades , in pitiful duty ,</l>
     <l n="20">Muffle the dinner-bell , mournfully ring .</l>

     <l n="21">[ Illustration : MASTER FRITZ . ]</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="22">Fritz and I are not brother and sister , but we 're next-door</l>
     <l n="23">neighbours ; for we both live next door .</l>
     <l n="24">I mean we both live next door to each other ; for I live at</l>
     <l n="25">number three , and Fritz and Nickel the dog live at number</l>
     <l n="26">four .</l>
     <l n="27">In summer we climb through the garret windows and sit</l>
     <l n="28">together on the leads ,</l>
     <l n="29">And if the sun is too hot Mother lends us one big kerchief</l>
     <l n="30">to put over both our heads .</l>
     <l n="31">Sometimes she gives us tea under the myrtle tree in the big</l>
     <l n="32">pot that stands in the gutter .</l>
     <l n="33">( One slice each , and I always give Fritz the one that has</l>
     <l n="34">the most butter . )</l>
     <l n="35">In winter we sit on the little stool by the stove at number four ;</l>
     <l n="36">For when it 's cold Fritz does n't like to go out to come in next door .</l>
     <l n="37">It was one day in spring that he said , “ I should like to</l>
     <l n="38">have a house to myself with you Grethel , and Nickel . ” And I</l>
     <l n="39">said , “ Thank you , Fritz . ”</l>
     <l n="40">And he said , “ If you 'll come in at tea-time and sit by the stove , I 'll</l>
     <l n="41">tell you tales that 'll frighten you into fits .</l>
     <l n="42">About boys who ran away from their homes , and were taken by robbers ,</l>
     <l n="43">and run after by wolves , and altogether in a dreadful state .</l>
     <l n="44">I saw the pictures of it in a book I was looking in , to see where</l>
     <l n="45">perhaps I should like to emigrate .</l>
     <l n="46">I 've not quite settled whether I shall , or be cast away on a desert</l>
     <l n="47">island , or settle down nearer home ;</l>
     <l n="48">But you 'd better come in and hear about it , and then , wherever it is ,</l>
     <l n="49">you 'll be sure to be ready to come . ”</l>
     <l n="50">So I took my darling Katerina in my arms , and we went in to tea .</l>
     <l n="51">I love Katerina , though she lost her head long ago , poor thing ; but</l>
     <l n="52">Fritz made me put her off my knee ,</l>
     <l n="53">For he said , “ When you 're hushabying that silly old doll I know you 're</l>
     <l n="54">not attending to me .</l>
     <l n="55">Now look here , Grethel , I think I have made up my mind that we wo n't</l>
     <l n="56">go far ;</l>
     <l n="57">For we can have a house , and I can be master of it just as well where</l>
     <l n="58">we are .</l>
     <l n="59">Under the stairs would be a good place for a house for us if there 's</l>
     <l n="60">room .</l>
     <l n="61">It 's very dirty , but you 're the housewife now , and you must sweep it</l>
     <l n="62">out well with the broom .</l>
     <l n="63">I shall expect you to keep my house very comfortable , and have my meals</l>
     <l n="64">ready when there 's anything to eat ;</l>
     <l n="65">And when Nickel and I come back from playing outside , you may peep out</l>
     <l n="66">and pretend you 're watching for us coming up the street .</l>
     <l n="67">You 've kept your apple , I see — I 've eaten mine — well , it will be</l>
     <l n="68">something to make a start ,</l>
     <l n="69">And I 'll put by some of my cake , if you 'll keep some of yours , and</l>
     <l n="70">remember Nickel must have part .</l>
     <l n="71">I call it your cake and your apple , but of course now you 're my</l>
     <l n="72">housewife everything belongs to me ;</l>
     <l n="73">But I shall give you the management of it , and you must make it go as</l>
     <l n="74">far as you can amongst three .</l>
     <l n="75">And if you make nice feasts every day for me and Nickel , and never</l>
     <l n="76">keep us waiting for our food ,</l>
     <l n="77">And always do everything I want , and attend to everything I say , I 'm</l>
     <l n="78">sure I shall almost always be good .</l>
     <l n="79">And if I am naughty now and then , it 'll most likely be your fault ;</l>
     <l n="80">and , if it is n't , you must n't mind ;</l>
     <l n="81">For even if I seem to be cross , you ought to know that I mean to be</l>
     <l n="82">kind .</l>
     <l n="83">And I 'm sure you 'll like combing Nickel 's hair for my sake ; it 'll be</l>
     <l n="84">something for you to do , and it bothers me so !</l>
     <l n="85">But it must be done regularly , for if it 's not , his curls tangle into</l>
     <l n="86">lugs as they grow .</l>
     <l n="87">I think that 's all , dear Grethel , for I love you so much that I 'm sure</l>
     <l n="88">to be easy to please .</l>
     <l n="89">Only remember — it 's a trifle — but when I want you , never keep that</l>
     <l n="90">headless doll on your knees .</l>
     <l n="91">I 'd much rather not have her in my house — there , do n't cry ! if you</l>
     <l n="92">will have her , I suppose it must be ;</l>
     <l n="93">Though I can n't think what you want with Katerina when you 've got</l>
     <l n="94">Nickel and me . ”</l>
     <l n="95">So I said , “ Thank you , dear Fritz , for letting me bring her , for I 've</l>
     <l n="96">had her so long I should n't like to part with her now ;</l>
     <l n="97">And I 'll try and do everything you want as well as I can , now you 've</l>
     <l n="98">told me how . ”</l>
     <l n="99">But next morning I heard Fritz 's garret-window open , and he put out</l>
     <l n="100">his head ,</l>
     <l n="101">And shouted , “ Grethel ! Grethel ! I want you . Be quick ! Have n't you got</l>
     <l n="102">out of bed ? ”</l>
     <l n="103">I ran to the window and said , “ What is it , dear Fritz ? ” and he said ,</l>
     <l n="104">“ I want to tell you that I 've changed my mind .</l>
     <l n="105">Hans-Wandermann is here , and he says there are real sapphires on the</l>
     <l n="106">beach ; so I 'm off to see what I can find . ”</l>
     <l n="107">“ Oh , Fritz ! ” I said , “ can n't I come too ? ” but he said , “ You 'd better</l>
     <l n="108">not , you 'll only be in the way .</l>
     <l n="109">You can stop quietly at home with Katerina , and you may have Nickel</l>
     <l n="110">too , if he 'll stay . ”</l>
     <l n="111">But Nickel would n't . I give him far more of my cake than Fritz does ,</l>
     <l n="112">but he likes Fritz better than me .</l>
     <l n="113">So dear Katerina and I had breakfast together on the leads under the</l>
     <l n="114">old myrtle tree .</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE WILLOW-MAN .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">There once was a Willow , and he was very old ,</l>
     <l n="2">And all his leaves fell off from him , and left him in the cold ;</l>
     <l n="3">But ere the rude winter could buffet him with snow ,</l>
     <l n="4">There grew upon his hoary head a crop of Mistletoe .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">All wrinkled and furrowed was this old Willow 's skin ,</l>
     <l n="6">His taper fingers trembled , and his arms were very thin ;</l>
     <l n="7">Two round eyes and hollow , that stared but did not see ,</l>
     <l n="8">And sprawling feet that never walked , had this most ancient tree .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">A Dame who dwelt near was the only one who knew</l>
     <l n="10">That every year upon his head the Christmas berries grew ;</l>
     <l n="11">And when the Dame cut them , she said — it was her whim —</l>
     <l n="12">“ A merry Christmas to you , Sir ! ” and left a bit for him .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">“ Oh , Granny dear , tell us , ” the children cried , “ where we</l>
     <l n="14">May find the shining Mistletoe that grows upon the tree ? ”</l>
     <l n="15">At length the Dame told them , but cautioned them to mind</l>
     <l n="16">To greet the Willow civilly , and leave a bit behind .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">“ Who cares , ” said the children , “ for this old Willow-man ?</l>
     <l n="18">We 'll take the Mistletoe , and he may catch us if he can . ”</l>
     <l n="19">With rage the ancient Willow shakes in every limb ,</l>
     <l n="20">For they have taken all , and have not left a bit for him !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">Then bright gleamed the holly , the Christmas berries shone ,</l>
     <l n="22">But in the wintry wind without the Willow-man did moan :</l>
     <l n="23">“ Ungrateful , and wasteful ! the mystic Mistletoe</l>
     <l n="24">A hundred years hath grown on me , but never more shall grow . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">A year soon passed by , and the children came once more ,</l>
     <l n="26">But not a sprig of Mistletoe the aged Willow bore .</l>
     <l n="27">Each slender spray pointed ; he mocked them in his glee ,</l>
     <l n="28">And chuckled in his wooden heart , that ancient Willow-tree .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>MORAL .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Oh , children , who gather the spoils of wood and wold ,</l>
     <l n="2">From selfish greed and wilful waste your little hands withhold .</l>
     <l n="3">Though fair things be common , this moral bear in mind ,</l>
     <l n="4">“ Pick thankfully and modestly , and leave a bit behind . ”</l>

    <head>OUR GARDEN .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The winter is gone ; and at first Jack and I were sad ,</l>
     <l n="2">Because of the snow-man 's melting , but now we are glad ;</l>
     <l n="3">For the spring has come , and it 's warm , and we 're allowed to garden</l>
     <l n="4">in the afternoon ;</l>
     <l n="5">And summer is coming , and oh , how lovely our flowers will be in June !</l>
     <l n="6">We are so fond of flowers , it makes us quite happy to think</l>
     <l n="7">Of our beds — all colours — blue , white , yellow , purple , and pink ,</l>
     <l n="8">Scarlet , lilac , and crimson ! And we 're fond of sweet scents as well ,</l>
     <l n="9">And mean to have pinks , roses , sweet peas , mignonette , clove</l>
     <l n="10">carnations , musk , and everything good to smell ;</l>
     <l n="11">Lavender , rosemary , and we should like a lemon-scented verbena , and</l>
     <l n="12">a big myrtle tree !</l>
     <l n="13">And then if we could get an old “ preserved-ginger ” pot , and some</l>
     <l n="14">bay-salt , we could make pot-pourri .</l>
     <l n="15">Jack and I have a garden , though it 's not so large as the big one ,</l>
     <l n="16">you know ;</l>
     <l n="17">But whatever can be got to grow in a garden we mean to grow .</l>
     <l n="18">We 've got Bachelor 's Buttons , and London Pride , and Old Man , and</l>
     <l n="19">everything that 's nice :</l>
     <l n="20">And last year Jack sowed green peas for our dolls ’ dinners , but they</l>
     <l n="21">were eaten up by the mice .</l>
     <l n="22">And he would plant potatoes in furrows , which made the garden in a</l>
     <l n="23">mess ,</l>
     <l n="24">So this year we mean to have no kitchen-garden but mustard and cress .</l>
     <l n="25">One of us plants , and the other waters , but Jack likes the</l>
     <l n="26">watering-pot ;</l>
     <l n="27">And then when my turn comes to water he says it 's too hot !</l>
     <l n="28">We sometimes quarrel about the garden , and once Jack hit me with</l>
     <l n="29">the spade ;</l>
     <l n="30">So we settled to divide it in two by a path up the middle , and</l>
     <l n="31">that 's made .</l>
     <l n="32">We want some yellow sand now to make the walk pretty , but there 's none</l>
     <l n="33">about here ,</l>
     <l n="34">So we mean to get some in the old carpet-bag , if we go to the seaside</l>
     <l n="35">this year .</l>
     <l n="36">On Monday we went to the wood and got primrose plants and a sucker of</l>
     <l n="37">a dog-rose ;</l>
     <l n="38">It looks like a green stick in the middle of the bed at present ; but</l>
     <l n="39">wait till it blows !</l>
     <l n="40">The primroses were in full flower , and the rose ought to flower soon ;</l>
     <l n="41">You 've no idea how lovely they are in that wood in June !</l>
     <l n="42">The primroses look quite withered now , I am sorry to say ,</l>
     <l n="43">But that is not our fault but Nurse 's , and it shows how hard it is to</l>
     <l n="44">garden when you can n't have your own way .</l>
     <l n="45">We planted them carefully , and were just going to water them all in</l>
     <l n="46">a lump ,</l>
     <l n="47">When Nurse fetched us both indoors , and put us to bed for wetting our</l>
     <l n="48">pinafores at the pump .</l>
     <l n="49">It 's very hard , and I 'm sure the gardener 's plants would n't grow any</l>
     <l n="50">better than ours ,</l>
     <l n="51">If Nurse fetched him in and sent him to bed just when he was going to</l>
     <l n="52">water his flowers .</l>
     <l n="53">We 've got Blue Nemophila and Mignonette , and Venus 's Looking-glass ,</l>
     <l n="54">and many other seeds ;</l>
     <l n="55">The Nemophila comes up spotted , which is how we know it from the weeds .</l>
     <l n="56">At least it 's sure to come up if the hens have n't scratched it up</l>
     <l n="57">first .</l>
     <l n="58">But when it is up the cats roll on it , and that is the worst !</l>
     <l n="59">I sowed a ring of sweet peas , and the last time I looked they were</l>
     <l n="60">coming nicely on ,</l>
     <l n="61">Just sprouting white , and I put them safely back ; but when Jack looked</l>
     <l n="62">he found they were gone .</l>
     <l n="63">Jack made a great many cuttings , but he has had rather bad luck ,</l>
     <l n="64">I 've looked at them every day myself , and not one of them has struck .</l>
     <l n="65">The gardener gave me a fine moss-rose , but Jack took it to his side ,</l>
     <l n="66">I kept moving it back , but he took it again , and at last it died .</l>
     <l n="67">But now we 've settled to dig up the path , and have the bed as it was</l>
     <l n="68">before ,</l>
     <l n="69">So everything will belong to us both , and we sha n't ever quarrel</l>
     <l n="70">any more .</l>
     <l n="71">It is such a long time , too , to wait for the sand , and perhaps</l>
     <l n="72">sea-sand does best on the shore .</l>
     <l n="73">We 're going to take everything up , for it can n't hurt the plants to</l>
     <l n="74">stand on the grass for a minute ,</l>
     <l n="75">And you really can n't possibly rake a bed smooth with so many</l>
     <l n="76">things in it .</l>
     <l n="77">We shall dig it all over , and get leaf-mould from the wood , and hoe</l>
     <l n="78">up the weeds ,</l>
     <l n="79">And when it 's tidy we shall plant , and put labels , and strike cuttings ,</l>
     <l n="80">and sow seeds .</l>
     <l n="81">We are so fond of flowers , Jack and I often dream at night</l>
     <l n="82">Of getting up and finding our garden ablaze with all colours , blue ,</l>
     <l n="83">red , yellow , and white .</l>
     <l n="84">And Midsummer 's coming , and big brother Tom will sit under the tree</l>
     <l n="85">With his book , and Mary will beg sweet nosegays of Jack and me .</l>
     <l n="86">The worst is , we often start for the seaside about Midsummer Day ,</l>
     <l n="87">And no one takes care of our gardens whilst we are away .</l>
     <l n="88">But if we sow lots of seeds , and take plenty of cuttings before we</l>
     <l n="89">leave home ,</l>
     <l n="90">When we come back , our flowers will be all in full bloom ,</l>
     <l n="91">Bright , bright sunshine above , and sweet , sweet flowers below .</l>
     <l n="92">Come , oh Midsummer , quickly come ! and go quickly , Midsummer , go !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="93">P. S . It is so tiresome ! Jack wants to build a green-house now ,</l>
     <l n="94">He has found some bits of broken glass , and an old window-frame , and</l>
     <l n="95">he says he knows how .</l>
     <l n="96">I tell him there 's not glass enough , but he says there 's lots ,</l>
     <l n="97">And he 's taken all the plants that belong to the bed and put</l>

    <head>THREE LITTLE NEST BIRDS .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">We meant to be very kind ,</l>
     <l n="2">But if ever we find</l>
     <l n="3">Another soft , grey-green , moss-coated , feather-lined nest in a hedge ,</l>
     <l n="4">We have taken a pledge —</l>
     <l n="5">Susan , Jemmy , and I — with remorseful tears , at this very minute ,</l>
     <l n="6">That if there are eggs or little birds in it —</l>
     <l n="7">Robin or wren , thrush , chaffinch or linnet —</l>
     <l n="8">We 'll leave them there</l>
     <l n="9">To their mother 's care .</l>
     <l n="10">There were three of us — Kate , and Susan , and Jem —</l>
     <l n="11">And three of them —</l>
     <l n="12">I do n't know their names , for they could n't speak ,</l>
     <l n="13">Except with a little imperative squeak ,</l>
     <l n="14">Exactly like Poll ,</l>
     <l n="15">Susan 's squeaking doll ;</l>
     <l n="16">But squeaking dolls will lie on the shelves</l>
     <l n="17">For years and never squeak of themselves :</l>
     <l n="18">The reason we like little birds so much better than toys</l>
     <l n="19">Is because they are really alive , and know how to make a noise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="20">There were three of us , and three of them ;</l>
     <l n="21">Kate ,— that is I ,— and Susan , and Jem .</l>
     <l n="22">Our mother was busy making a pie ,</l>
     <l n="23">And theirs , we think , was up in the sky ;</l>
     <l n="24">But for all Susan , Jemmy , or I can tell ,</l>
     <l n="25">She may have been getting their dinner as well .</l>
     <l n="26">They were left to themselves ( and so were we )</l>
     <l n="27">In a nest in the hedge by the willow tree ;</l>
     <l n="28">And when we caught sight of three red little fluff-tufted , hazel-eyed ,</l>
     <l n="29">open-mouthed , pink-throated heads , we all shouted for glee .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="30">The way we really did wrong was this :</l>
     <l n="31">We took them for Mother to kiss ,</l>
     <l n="32">And she told us to put them back ;</l>
     <l n="33">Whilst out on the weeping-willow their mother was crying “ Alack ! ”</l>
     <l n="34">We really heard</l>
     <l n="35">Both what Mother told us to do , and the voice of the mother-bird .</l>
     <l n="36">But we three — that is Susan and I and Jem —</l>
     <l n="37">Thought we knew better than either of them :</l>
     <l n="38">And in spite of our mother 's command and the poor bird 's cry ,</l>
     <l n="39">We determined to bring up her three little nestlings ourselves</l>
     <l n="40">on the sly .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="41">We each took one ,</l>
     <l n="42">It did seem such excellent fun !</l>
     <l n="43">Susan fed hers on milk and bread ,</l>
     <l n="44">Jem got wriggling worms for his instead .</l>
     <l n="45">I gave mine meat ,</l>
     <l n="46">For , you know , I thought , “ Poor darling pet ! why should n't it have</l>
     <l n="47">roast beef to eat ? ”</l>
     <l n="48">But , oh dear ! oh dear ! oh dear ! how we cried</l>
     <l n="49">When in spite of milk and bread and worms and roast beef , the</l>
     <l n="50">little birds died !</l>
     <l n="51">It 's a terrible thing to have heart-ache ,</l>
     <l n="52">I thought mine would break</l>
     <l n="53">As I heard the mother-bird 's moan ,</l>
     <l n="54">And looked at the grey-green , moss-coated , feather-lined nest she had</l>
     <l n="55">taken such pains to make ,</l>
     <l n="56">And her three little children dead , and as cold as stone .</l>
     <l n="57">Mother said , and it 's sadly true ,</l>
     <l n="58">“ There are some wrong things one can never undo . ”</l>
     <l n="59">And nothing that we could do or say</l>
     <l n="60">Would bring life back to the birds that day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="61">The bitterest tears that we could weep</l>
     <l n="62">Would n't wake them out of their stiff cold sleep .</l>
     <l n="63">But then ,</l>
     <l n="64">We — Susan and Jem and I — mean never to be so selfish , and wilful ,</l>
     <l n="65">and cruel again .</l>
     <l n="66">And we three have buried those other three</l>
     <l n="67">In a soft , green , moss-covered , flower-lined grave at the foot of</l>
     <l n="68">the willow tree .</l>
     <l n="69">And all the leaves which its branches shed</l>
     <l n="70">We think are tears because they are dead .</l>

     <l n="4">When she 's good-humoured we like to go and watch her at work .</l>
     <l n="5">She has tubs and a copper in the wash-house , and a great big fire and</l>
     <l n="6">plenty of soap ;</l>
     <l n="7">And outside is the drying-ground with tall posts , and pegs bought from</l>
     <l n="8">the gipsies , and long lines of rope .</l>
     <l n="9">The laundry is indoors with another big fire , and long tables , and a</l>
     <l n="10">lot of irons , and a crimping-machine ;</l>
     <l n="11">And horses ( not live ones with tails , but clothes-horses ) and the same</l>

     <l n="14">splashes , and rubs ,</l>
     <l n="15">And makes beautiful white lather which foams over the tops of the tubs ,</l>
     <l n="16">Like waves at the seaside dashing against the rocks , only not so</l>

     <l n="18">If I were Sally I should sit and blow soap-bubbles all the day long .</l>

     <l n="43">As we wanted to have as big a wash as we could , we collected</l>
     <l n="44">everything we could muster ,</l>
     <l n="45">From the dolls ’ bed dimity hangings to Victoria 's dress , which I 'd</l>
     <l n="46">used as a duster .</l>
     <l n="47">It was going to the wash , and Mary and I were house-maids — fancy</l>
     <l n="48">house-maids , I mean —</l>
     <l n="49">And I took it to dust the bookshelf , for I knew it would come back</l>
     <l n="50">clean .</l>
     <l n="51">Well , we washed in the wash-hand-basin , which holds a good deal , as</l>
     <l n="52">the things are small ;</l>
     <l n="53">We made a glorious lather , and splashed half over the floor ; but the</l>
     <l n="54">clothes were n't white after all .</l>
     <l n="55">However , we hung them out in our drying-ground in the garden , which</l>
     <l n="56">we made with dahlia-sticks and long strings ,</l>
     <l n="57">And then Dash went and knocked over one of the posts , and down in the</l>
     <l n="58">dirt went our things !</l>
     <l n="59">So we washed them again and hung them on the towel-horse , and most of</l>
     <l n="60">them came all right ,</l>
     <l n="61">But Victoria 's muslin dress — though I rinsed it again and again — will</l>
     <l n="62">never dry white !</l>
     <l n="63">And the grease-spots on Mary 's doll 's dress do n't seem to come out , and</l>
     <l n="64">we can n't think how they got there ;</l>
     <l n="65">Unless it was when we made that Macassar-oil , because she has</l>
     <l n="66">real hair .</l>
     <l n="67">I knew mine was going to the wash , but I 'm sorry I used it as a duster</l>
     <l n="68">before it went ;</l>
     <l n="69">We think dirty clothes perhaps should n't be too dirty before they</l>
     <l n="70">are sent .</l>
     <l n="71">We had sad work in trying to make the starch — I wonder what the Queen</l>
     <l n="72">does with hers ?</l>
     <l n="73">I stirred mine up with a candle , like Sally , but it only made it worse ;</l>
     <l n="74">So we had to ask Mamma 's leave to have ours made by Nurse .</l>
     <l n="75">Nurse makes beautiful starch — like water-arrowroot when you 're ill — in</l>
     <l n="76">a minute or two .</l>
     <l n="77">It 's a very odd thing that what looks so easy should be so difficult</l>
     <l n="78">to do !</l>
     <l n="79">Then Mary put the iron down to heat , but as soon as she 'd turned</l>
     <l n="80">her back ,</l>
     <l n="81">A jet of gas came sputtering out of the coals and smoked it black .</l>
     <l n="82">We dared not ask Sally for another , for we knew she 'd refuse it ,</l>
     <l n="83">So we had to clean this one with sand and brown-paper before we</l>
     <l n="84">could use it .</l>
     <l n="85">It was very hard work , but I rubbed till I made it shine ;</l>
     <l n="86">Yet as soon as it got on a damped “ fine thing ” it left a brown line .</l>
     <l n="87">I rubbed it for a long , long time before it would iron without a mark ,</l>
     <l n="88">But it did at last , and we finished our Dolls ’ Wash just before dark .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="89">Sally 's very kind , for she praised our wash , and she has taken away</l>
     <l n="90">Victoria 's dress to do it again ; and I really must say</l>
     <l n="91">She was right when she said , “ You see , young ladies , a week 's wash</l>
     <l n="92">is n't all play . ”</l>
     <l n="93">Our backs ache , our faces are red , our hands are all wrinkled , and</l>
     <l n="94">we 've rubbed our fingers quite sore ;</l>
     <l n="95">We feel very sorry for Sally every week , and we do n't mean to dirty</l>
     <l n="96">our dresses so much any more .</l>

    <head>HOUSE-BUILDING AND REPAIRS .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Father is building a new house , but I 've had one given to me for</l>
     <l n="2">my own ;</l>
     <l n="3">Brick red , with a white window , and black where it ought to be glass ,</l>
     <l n="4">and the chimney yellow , like stone .</l>
     <l n="5">Brother Bill made me the shelves with his tool-box , and the table I</l>
     <l n="6">had before , and the pestle-and-mortar ;</l>
     <l n="7">And Mother gave me the jam-pot when it was empty ; it 's rather big , but</l>
     <l n="8">it 's the only pot we have that will really hold water .</l>
     <l n="9">We — that is I and Jemima , my doll . ( For it 's a Doll 's House , you know ,</l>
     <l n="10">Though some of the things are real , like the nutmeg-grater , but not</l>
     <l n="11">the wooden plates that stand in a row .</l>
     <l n="12">They came out of a box of toy tea-things , and I can n't think what</l>
     <l n="13">became of the others ;</l>
     <l n="14">But one never can tell what becomes of anything when one has brothers . )</l>
     <l n="15">Jemima is much smaller than I am , and , being made of wood , she is thin ;</l>
     <l n="16">She takes up too much room inside , but she can lie outside on the roof</l>
     <l n="17">without breaking it in .</l>
     <l n="18">I wish I had a drawing-room to put her in when I want to really cook ;</l>
     <l n="19">I have to have the kitchen-table outside as it is , and the</l>
     <l n="20">pestle-and-mortar is rather too heavy for it , and everybody</l>
     <l n="21">can look .</l>
     <l n="22">There 's no front door to the house , because there 's no front to have a</l>
     <l n="23">door in , and beside ,</l>
     <l n="24">If there were , I could n't play with anything , for I should n't know how</l>
     <l n="25">to get inside .</l>
     <l n="26">I never heard of a house with only one room , except the cobbler 's , and</l>
     <l n="27">his was a stall .</l>
     <l n="28">I do n't quite know what that is ; but it is n't a house , and it served</l>
     <l n="29">him for parlour and kitchen and all .</l>
     <l n="30">Father says that whilst he is about it , he thinks he shall add on</l>
     <l n="31">a wing ;</l>
     <l n="32">And brother Bill says he 'll nail my Doll 's House on the top of an</l>
     <l n="33">old tea-chest , which will come to the same thing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="34">Father 's house is not finished , though the wing is ; for now the</l>
     <l n="35">builder says it will be all wrong if there is n't another</l>
     <l n="36">to match ;</l>
     <l n="37">And my house is n't done either , though it 's nailed on , for Bill took</l>
     <l n="38">off the roof to make a new one of thatch .</l>
     <l n="39">The paint is very much scratched , but he says that 's nothing , for it</l>
     <l n="40">must have had a new coat ;</l>
     <l n="41">And he means to paint it for me , inside and out , when he paints</l>
     <l n="42">his own boat .</l>
     <l n="43">There 's a sad hole in the floor , but Bill says the wood is as rotten</l>
     <l n="44">as rotten can be :</l>
     <l n="45">Which was why he made such a mess of the side with trying to put real</l>
     <l n="46">glass in the window , through which one can see .</l>
     <l n="47">Bill says he believes that the shortest plan would be to make a new</l>
     <l n="48">Doll 's House with proper rooms , in the regular way ;</l>
     <l n="49">Which was what the builder said to Father when he wanted to build in</l>
     <l n="50">the old front ; and to-day</l>
     <l n="51">I heard him tell him the old materials were no good to use and were n't</l>
     <l n="52">worth the expense of carting away .</l>
     <l n="53">I do n't know when I shall be able to play at dolls again , for all the</l>
     <l n="54">things are put away in a box ;</l>
     <l n="55">Except Jemima and the pestle-and-mortar , and they 're in the bottom</l>
     <l n="56">drawer with my Sunday frocks .</l>
     <l n="57">I almost wish I had kept the house as it was before ;</l>
     <l n="58">We managed very well with a painted window and without a front door .</l>
     <l n="59">I do n't know what Father means to do with his house , but if ever</l>
     <l n="60">mine is finished , I 'll never have it altered any more .</l>

   <p>THE BLUE-BELLS ON THE LEA .</p>
   <p>FAIRY KING .</p>
   <p>“ The breeze is on the Blue-bells , The wind is on the lea ; Stay out ! stay out ! my little lad , And chase the wind with me . If you will give yourself to me , Within the fairy ring , At deep midnight , When stars are bright , You 'll hear the Blue-bells ring — D ! DI ! DIN ! DING ! On slender stems they swing .</p>
   <p>“ The rustling wind , the whistling wind , We 'll chase him to and fro , We 'll chase him up , we 'll chase him down To where the King-cups grow ; And where old Jack-o ’ - Lantern waits To light us on our way , And far behind , Upon the wind , The Blue-bells seem to play — D ! DI ! DIN ! DING ! Lest we should go astray .</p>
   <p>“ So gay that fairy music , So jubilant those bells , How days and weeks and months go by No happy listener tells ! The toad-stools are with sweetmeats spread , The new Moon lends her light , And ringers small Wait , one and all , To ring with all their might — D ! DI ! DIN ! DING ! And welcome you to night . ”</p>
   <p>BOY .</p>
   <p>“ My mother made me promise To be in time for tea , ‘ Go home ! go home ! ’ the breezes say , That sigh along the lea . I dare not give myself away ; For what would Mother do ? I wish I might Stay out all night At fairy games with you . D ! DI ! DIN ! DING ! And hear the bells of blue .</p>
   <p>“ But Father sleeps beneath the grass , And Mother is alone : And who would fill the pails , and fetch The wood when I am gone ? And who , when little Sister ails , Can comfort her , but me ? Her cries and tears Would reach my ears Through all the melody — D ! DI ! DIN ! DING ! Of Blue-bells on the lea . ”</p>
   <p>The sun was on the Blue-bells , The lad was on the lea . “ Oh , wondrous bells ! Oh , fairy bells ! I pray you ring to me . I only did as Mother bade , For tea I did not care , And winds at night Give more delight Than all this noonday glare . ” D ! DI ! DIN ! DING ! No sound of bells was there .</p>
   <p>BOY .</p>
   <p>“ The snow lies o'er the Blue-bells , A storm is on the lea ; Our hearth is warm , the fire burns bright , The flames dance merrily . Oh , Mother dear ! I would no more That on that summer 's day , Within the ring , The Fairy King Had stolen me away — D ! DI ! DIN ! DING ! To where the Blue-bells play .</p>
   <p>“ Yet when the storm is loudest , At deep midnight I dream , And up and down upon the lea To chase the wind I seem ; While by my side , in feathered cap , There runs the Fairy King , And down below , Beneath the snow , We hear the Blue-bells ring — D ! DI ! DIN ! DING ! Such happy dreams they bring ! ”</p>

    <head>AN ONLY CHILD 'S TEA-PARTY .</head>
    <head>When I go to tea with the little Smiths , there are eight of them there , but there 's only one of me , Which makes it not so easy to have a fancy tea-party as if there were two or three . I had a tea-party on my birthday , but Joe Smith says it can n't have been a regular one , Because as to a tea-party with only one teacup and no teapot , sugar-basin , cream-jug , or slop-basin , he never heard of such a thing under the sun . But it was a very big teacup , and quite full of milk and water , and , you see , There was n't anybody there who could really drink milk and water except Towser and me . The dolls can only pretend , and then it washes the paint off their lips , And what Charles the canary drinks is n't worth speaking of , for he takes such very small sips . Joe says a kitchen-chair is n't a table ; but it has got four legs and a top , so it would be if the back was n't there ; And that does for Charles to perch on , and I have to put the Prince of Wales to lean against it , because his legs have no joints to sit on a chair .</head>

     <l n="2">That 's the small doll . I call him the Prince of Wales because he 's</l>
     <l n="3">the eldest son , you see ;</l>
     <l n="4">For I 've taken him for my brother , and he was Mother 's doll before</l>
     <l n="5">I was born , so of course he is older than me .</l>
     <l n="6">Towser is my real live brother , but I do n't think he 's as old as the</l>
     <l n="7">Prince of Wales ;</l>
     <l n="8">He 's a perfect darling , though he whisks everything over he comes</l>
     <l n="9">near , and I tell him I do n't know what we should do if</l>
     <l n="10">we all had tails .</l>
     <l n="11">His hair curls like mine in front , and grows short like a lion behind ,</l>
     <l n="12">but no one need be frightened , for he 's as good as good ;</l>
     <l n="13">And as to roaring like a real menagerie lion , or eating people up ,</l>
     <l n="14">I do n't believe he would if he could .</l>
     <l n="15">He has his tea out of the saucer after I 've had mine out of the cup ;</l>
     <l n="16">You see I am sure to leave some for him , but if I let him begin first</l>
     <l n="17">he would drink it all up .</l>
     <l n="18">The big doll Godmamma gave me this birthday , and the chair she gave me</l>
     <l n="19">the year before .</l>
     <l n="20">( I have n't many toys , but I take great care of them , and every birthday</l>
     <l n="21">I shall have more and more . )</l>
     <l n="22">You 've no idea what a beautiful doll she is , and when I pinch her in</l>
     <l n="23">the middle , she can squeak ;</l>
     <l n="24">It quite frightened Towser , for he did n't know that any of us but he</l>
     <l n="25">and I and Charles were able to speak .</l>
     <l n="26">I 've taken her for my only sister , for of course I may take anybody</l>
     <l n="27">I choose ;</l>
     <l n="28">I 've called her Cinderella , because I 'm so fond of the story , and</l>
     <l n="29">because she 's got real shoes .</l>
     <l n="30">I do n't feel so only now there are so many of us ; for , counting</l>
     <l n="31">Cinderella there are five ,—</l>
     <l n="32">She , and I , and Towser , and Charles , and the Prince of Wales — and</l>
     <l n="33">three of us are really alive ;</l>
     <l n="34">And four of us can speak , and I 'm sure the Prince of Wales is</l>
     <l n="35">wonderful for his size ;</l>
     <l n="36">For his things ( at least he 's only got one thing ) take off and on ,</l>
     <l n="37">and , though he 's nothing but wood , he 's got real glass eyes .</l>
     <l n="38">And perhaps in three birthdays more there may be as many of us as the</l>
     <l n="39">Smiths , for five and three make eight ;</l>
     <l n="40">I shall be seven years old then ( as old as Joe ) , but I do n't like</l>
     <l n="41">to think too much of it , it 's so long to wait .</l>
     <l n="42">And after all I do n't know that I want any more of us : I think I 'd</l>
     <l n="43">rather my sister had a chair</l>
     <l n="44">Like mine ; and the next year I should like a collar for Towser if</l>
     <l n="45">it would n't rub off his hair .</l>
     <l n="46">And it would be very nice if the Prince of Wales could be dressed</l>
     <l n="47">like a Field-marshal , for he 's got nothing on his legs ;</l>
     <l n="48">And Cinderella 's beautifully dressed , and Towser looks quite as if</l>
     <l n="49">he 'd got a fur coat on when he begs .</l>
     <l n="50">Joe says it 's perfectly absurd , and that I can n't take a Pomeranian</l>
     <l n="51">in earnest for my brother ;</l>
     <l n="52">But I do n't think he really and truly knows how much Towser and I</l>
     <l n="53">love each other .</l>
     <l n="54">I did n't like his saying , “ Well , there 's one thing about your lot ,— you</l>
     <l n="55">can always have your own way . ”</l>
     <l n="56">And then he says , “ You can n't possibly have fun with four people when</l>
     <l n="57">you have to pretend what they say . ”</l>
     <l n="58">But , whatever he says , I do n't believe I shall ever enjoy a tea-party</l>
     <l n="59">more than the one that we had on that day .</l>

     <l n="3">You were called Papa Poodle because you took care of me when I was</l>

     <l n="10">Here am I doing the whole British Army by myself , for Bill is obliged</l>
     <l n="11">to be the French ;</l>
     <l n="12">And I 've come away to hear you say your lesson , and left Bill waiting</l>
     <l n="13">for me in the trench .</l>

     <l n="22">wondering why ;</l>
     <l n="23">But I 'm afraid the truth is , Papa Poodle , that you 're uncommonly sly .</l>
     <l n="24">You did no spelling-lessons last week , for you were out from morning</l>
     <l n="25">till night ,</l>
     <l n="26">Except when you slunk in , like a dirty door-mat on legs , and with one</l>
     <l n="27">ear bleeding from a fight ,</l>
     <l n="28">Looking as if you 'd no notion what o'clock it was , and had come home</l>
     <l n="29">to see .</l>
     <l n="30">But your watch keeps very good meal-time , Papa Poodle , for you 're</l>
     <l n="31">always at breakfast , and dinner , and tea .</l>
     <l n="32">No , it 's no good your shaking hands and licking me with your</l>
     <l n="33">tongue ,— I know you can do that ;</l>
     <l n="34">But sitting up , and giving paws , and kissing , wo n't teach you to</l>
     <l n="35">spell C A T , Cat .</l>
     <l n="36">I wonder , if I let you off lessons , whether I could teach you to pull</l>
     <l n="37">the string with your teeth , and fire our new gun ?</l>
     <l n="38">If I could , you might be the Artillery all to yourself , and it would</l>
     <l n="39">be capital fun .</l>
     <l n="40">You wag your tail at that , do you ? You would like it a great deal</l>
     <l n="41">better ?</l>
     <l n="42">But I can n't bear you to be such a dunce , when you look so wise ; and</l>
     <l n="43">yet I do n't believe you 'll ever learn a letter .</l>

   <p>The following note was given in Aunt Judy 's Magazine , June 1880 , when “ Grandmother 's Spring ” first appeared :— “ It may interest old readers of Aunt Judy 's Magazine to know that ‘ Leave some for the Naïads and the Dryads ’ was a favourite phrase with Mr. Alfred Gatty , and is not merely the charge of an imaginary mother to her ‘ blue-eyed banditti . ’ Whether my mother invented the expression for our benefit , or whether she only quoted it , I do not know . I only remember its use as a check on the indiscriminate ‘ collecting ’ and ‘ grubbing ’ of a large family ; a mystic warning not without force to fetter the same fingers in later life , with all the power of a pious tradition . ” — J. H. E .</p>

     <l n="1">Are you a Giant , great big man , or is your real name Smith ?</l>
     <l n="2">Nurse says you 've got a hammer that you hit bad children with .</l>

   <p>Why do you make the horses ’ shoes of iron instead of leather ? Is it because they are allowed to go out in bad weather ? If horses should be shod with iron , Big Smith , will you shoe mine ? For now I may not take him out , excepting when it 's fine .</p>

     <l n="27">But when I see your forge-light come and go upon the wall ,</l>
     <l n="28">And hear you through the window , I am not afraid at all .</l>

     <l n="29">I often hear a trotting horse , I sometimes hear it stop ;</l>

     <l n="31">Before it goes , I 'm apt to fall asleep , Big Smith , it 's true ;</l>

    <head>A SWEET LITTLE DEAR</head>
    <head>I always was a remarkable child ; so old for my age , and such a sensitive nature !— Mamma often says so . And I 'm the sweetest , little dear in my blue ribbons , and quite a picture in my Pompadour hat !— Mrs . Brown told her so on Sunday , and that 's how I know . And I 'm a sacred responsibility to my parents — ( it was what the clergyman 's wife at the seaside said ) , And a solemn charge , and a fair white page , and a tender bud , and a spotless nature of wax to be moulded ;— but the rest of it has gone out of my head . There was a lot more , and she left two books as well , and I think she called me a Privilege , and Mamma said “ Yes , ” and began to cry . And Nurse came in with luncheon on a tray , and put away the books , and said she was as weak as a kitten , and worried to fiddlestrings , as any one with common sense could see with half an eye . I was hopping round the room , but I stopped and said , “ My kitten 's not weak , and I do n't believe anybody could see with only half an eye . Could they , Mamma ? ” And Nurse said , “ Go and play , my dear , and let your Mamma rest ; ” but Mamma said , “ No , my love , stay where you are . Dear Nurse , lift me up , and put a pillow to my back , I know you mean to be kind ; But she does ask such remarkable questions , and while I 've strength to speak , do n't let me check the inquiring mind . If I should fail to be all a mother ought — oh , how my head throbs when the dear child jumps ! ” and then Nurse said , “ Ugh ! When you 're worried into your grave , she 'll have no mother at all , and 'll have to tumble up as other folks do . There 's the poor master at his wits ’ end — a child 's not all a grown person has to think of — and Miss Jane would do well enough if she 'd less of her own way ; But there 's more children spoilt with care than the want of it , and more mothers murdered than there 's folks hanged for , and that 's what I say . Children learns what you teach ‘ em , and Miss Jane 's old enough to have learned to wait upon you : And if her mother thought less of her and she thought more of her mother , it would be better for her too . ” But Nurse is a nasty cross old thing — I hate her ; and I hate the doctor , for he wanted me to be left behind When Mamma went to the sea for her health ; but I begged and begged till she promised I should go , for Mamma is always kind . And she bought me a new wooden spade and a basket , and a red and green ship with three masts , and a one-and-sixpenny telescope to look at the sea ; But when I got on to the sands , I thought I 'd rather be on the esplanade , for there was a little girl there who was looking at me , Dressed in a navy-blue suit and a sailor hat , with fair hair tied with ribbons ; so I told Mamma , And she got me a suit , ready-made ( but she said it was dreadfully dear ) , and a hat to match , in the Pebble Brooch Repository and Universal Bazaar . It faded in the sun , and came all to pieces in the wash ; but I was tired of it before . For the esplanade is very dull , and the little girl with fair hair had got sand-boots and a shrimping-net and was playing on the shore . And when my sand-boots came home , and I 'd got a better net than hers , she went donkey-riding , and I knew it was to tease me , But Nurse was so cross , and said if they sent a man in a herring-boat to the moon for what I wanted that nothing would please me . So I said the seaside was a very disagreeable place , and I wished I had n't come , And I told Mamma so , and begged her to try and get well soon , to take us all home . But now we 've got home , it 's very hot , and I 'm afraid of the wasps ; and I 'm sure it was cooler at the sea , And the Smiths wo n't be back for a fortnight , so I can n't even have Matilda to tea . I do n't care much for my new doll — I think I 'm too old for dolls now ; I like books better , though I did n't like the last , And I 've read all I have : I always skip the dull parts , and when you skip a good deal you get through them so fast . I like toys if they 're the best kind , with works ; though when I 've had one good game with them , I do n't much care to play with them again . I feel as if I wanted something new to amuse me , and Mamma says it 's because I 've got such an active brain . Nurse says I do n't know what I want , and I know I do n't , and that 's just what it is . It seems so sad a young creature like me should feel unhappy , and not know what 's amiss ; But Nurse never thinks of my feelings , any more than the cruel nurse in the story about the little girl who was so good , And if I die early as she did , perhaps then people will be sorry I 've been misunderstood . I should n't like to die early , but I should like people to be sorry for me , and to praise me when I was dead : If I could only come to life again when they had missed me very much , and I 'd heard what they said — Of course that 's impossible , I know , but I wish I knew what to do instead ! It seems such a pity that a sweet little dear like me should ever be sad . And Mamma says she buys everything I want , and has taught me everything I will learn , and reads every book , and takes every hint she can pick up , and keeps me with her all day , and worries about me all night , till she 's nearly mad ; And if any kind person can think of any better way to make me happy we shall both of us be glad .</head>

     <l n="141">These nine big lobsters were all of them red .<span corresp="#note2" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></l>
     <l n="142">And when they got safe to the floor of the tank ,—</l>
     <l n="143">For which they had chiefly good luck to thank ,—</l>
     <l n="144">They settled their cumbersome coats of mail ,</l>
     <l n="145">And every lobster tucked his tail</l>
     <l n="146">Neatly under him as he sat</l>
     <l n="147">In a circle of nine for a cosy chat .</l>
     <l n="148">They seemed to be sitting hand in hand ,</l>
     <l n="149">As shoulder to shoulder they sat in the sand ,</l>
     <l n="150">And waved their antennæ in calm rotation ,</l>
     <l n="151">Apparently holding a consultation .</l>
     <l n="152">But what were the feelings of Master Blue Shell ?</l>
     <l n="153">Oh , gentle Reader ! how shall I tell ?</l>

   <note xml:id="note1" place="bottom" n="1">The colours of lobsters vary a good deal in various localities . Homarus vulgaris , the common lobster , is spotted , and , on the upper part , more or less of a bluish black . I once saw a lobster that had just got a new shell , and was of every lovely shade of blue and violet .</note>
   <note xml:id="note2" place="bottom" n="2">Palurinus vulgaris , the spiny lobster , has no true claws , but huge hairy antennæ . These lobsters are red during their lifetime ! I have seen them ( in the Crystal Palace Aquarium ) seated exactly as here described , with blue lobsters watching them from niches of the rocky sides of the tank , where they looked like blue-jerseyed smugglers at the mouths of caves .</note>

     <l n="2">He never could bear his blue coat more .</l>

     <l n="4">“ Did you ever see any lobsters so grand ,</l>
     <l n="5">As those who sit down there in the sand ?</l>
     <l n="6">Why were we born at all , since not one of us all was born red ? ”</l>
     <l n="7">“ Dear Brother , indeed , this is quite a whim . ”</l>

     <l n="20">Roses and blushes and red sunrise ;</l>
     <l n="21">For a glow on the Alps , and the glow of a forge ,</l>
     <l n="22">A foxglove bank in a woodland gorge ;</l>
     <l n="23">Sparks that are struck from red-hot bars ,</l>
     <l n="24">The sun in a mist , and the red star Mars ;</l>
     <l n="25">Flowers of countless shades and shapes ,</l>
     <l n="26">Matadors ’ , judges ’ , and gipsies ’ capes ;</l>
     <l n="27">The red-haired king who was killed in the wood ,</l>

     <l n="38">You sow blue beans , and rear scarlet runners .</l>
     <l n="39">Then think of the blue of a mid-day sky ,</l>

     <l n="42">Worcester china and “ jap ” tea-pots .</l>
     <l n="43">The blue that the western sky wears casually ,</l>

    <head>A SOLDIER 'S CHILDREN .</head>
    <head>Our home used to be in a hut in the dear old Camp , with lots of bands and trumpets and bugles and Dead Marches , and three times a day there was a gun , But now we live in View Villa at the top of the village , and it is n't nearly such fun . We never see any soldiers , except one day we saw a Volunteer , and we ran after him as hard as ever we could go , for we thought he looked rather brave ; But there 's only been one funeral since we came , an ugly black thing with no Dead March or Union Jack , and not even a firing party at the grave . There is a man in uniform to bring the letters , but he 's nothing like our old Orderly , Brown ; I told him , through the hedge , “ Your facings are dirty , and you 'd have to wear your belt if my father was at home , ” and oh , how he did frown ! But things can n't be expected to go right when Old Father 's away , and he 's gone to the war ; Which is why we play at soldiers and fighting battles more than ever we did before . And I try to keep things together : every morning I have a parade of myself and Dick , To see that we are clean , and to drill him and do sword-exercise with poor Grandpapa 's stick . Grandpapa 's dead , so he does n't want it now , and Dick 's too young for a real tin sword like mine : He 's so young he wo n't make up his mind whether he 'll go into the Artillery or the Line . I want him to be a gunner , for his frock 's dark blue , and Captain Powder gave us a wooden gun with an elastic that shoots quite a big ball . It 's nonsense Dick 's saying he 'd like to be a Chaplain , for that 's not being a soldier at all . Besides , he always wants to be Drum-Major when we 've funerals , to stamp the stick and sing RUM — TUM — TUM — To the Dead March in Saul ( that 's the name of the tune , and you play it on a drum ) .</head>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Mary is so good , she might easily be a Chaplain , but of course she</l>
     <l n="3">can n't be anything that wants man ;</l>
     <l n="4">She likes nursing her doll , but when we have battles she moves the</l>
     <l n="5">lead soldiers about , and does what she can .</l>
     <l n="6">She never grumbles about not being able to grow up into a General ,</l>
     <l n="7">though I should think it must be a great bore .</l>
     <l n="8">I asked her what she would do if she were grown up into a woman ,</l>
     <l n="9">and belonged to some one who was wounded in the war ,—</l>
     <l n="10">She said she 'd go out and nurse him : so I said , “ But supposing you</l>
     <l n="11">could n't get him better , and he died ; how would you behave ? ”</l>
     <l n="12">And she said if she could n't get a ship to bring him home in , she</l>
     <l n="13">should stay out there and grow a garden , and make wreaths</l>
     <l n="14">for his grave .</l>
     <l n="15">Nurse says we ought n't to have battles , now Father 's gone to battle ,</l>
     <l n="16">but that 's just the reason why !</l>
     <l n="17">And I do n't believe one bit what she said about its making Mother cry .</l>
     <l n="18">Only she does like us to put away our toys on Sunday , so we can n't</l>
     <l n="19">have the soldiers or the gun ;</l>
     <l n="20">But yesterday Dick said , “ I was thinking in church , and I 've thought</l>
     <l n="21">of a game about soldiers , and it 's a perfectly Sunday one ;</l>
     <l n="22">It 's a Church Parade : you 'll have to be a lot of officers and men ,</l>
     <l n="23">Mary 'll do for a few wives and families , and I 'll be Chaplain</l>
     <l n="24">to the Forces and pray for everyone at the war . ”</l>
     <l n="25">So he put his nightgown over his knickerbocker suit , and knelt on the</l>
     <l n="26">Ashantee stool , and Mary and I knelt on the floor .</l>
     <l n="27">I think it was rather nice of Dick , for he said what put it into</l>
     <l n="28">his head</l>
     <l n="29">Was thinking they might n't have much time for their prayers on active</l>
     <l n="30">service , and we ought to say them instead .</l>
     <l n="31">I should have liked to parade the lead soldiers , but I did n't , for</l>
     <l n="32">Mother says , “ What 's the good of being a soldier 's son if</l>
     <l n="33">you can n't do as you 're bid ? ”</l>
     <l n="34">But we thought there 'd be no harm in letting the box be there if we</l>
     <l n="35">kept on the lid .</l>
     <l n="36">Dick could n't pray out of the Prayer-book , because he 's backward with</l>
     <l n="37">being delicate , and he can n't read ;</l>
     <l n="38">So he had to make a prayer out of his own head , and I think he did it</l>
     <l n="39">very well indeed .</l>
     <l n="40">He began , “ GOD save the Queen , and the Army and the Navy , and the</l>
     <l n="41">Irregular Forces and the Volunteers !</l>
     <l n="42">Especially Old Father ( he went out with the first draft , and he 's a</l>
     <l n="43">Captain in the Royal Engineers ” ) .</l>
     <l n="44">But I said , “ I do n't think ‘ GOD save the Queen ’ is a proper prayer ,</l>
     <l n="45">I think it 's only a sort of three cheers . ”</l>
     <l n="46">So he said , “ GOD bless the Generals , and the Colonels , and the Majors ,</l>
     <l n="47">and the Captains , and the Lieutenants , and the</l>
     <l n="48">Sub-lieutenants , and the Quartermasters , and the</l>
     <l n="49">non-commissioned officers , and the men ;</l>
     <l n="50">And the bands , and the colours , and the guns , and the horses and the</l>
     <l n="51">wagons , and the gun-carriage they use for the funerals ; and</l>
     <l n="52">please I should like them all to come home safe again .</l>
     <l n="53">( Do n't , Mary ! I have n't finished ; it is n't time for you to say Amen . )</l>
     <l n="54">I have n't prayed for the Chaplains , or the Doctors who help the poor</l>
     <l n="55">men left groaning on the ground when the victories are won ;</l>
     <l n="56">And I want to pray particularly for the very poor ones who die of fever</l>
     <l n="57">and miss all the fighting and fun .</l>
     <l n="58">GOD bless the good soldiers , like Old Father , and Captain Powder ,</l>
     <l n="59">and the men with good-conduct medals ; and please let the</l>
     <l n="60">naughty ones all be forgiven ;</l>
     <l n="61">And if the black men kill our men , send down white angels to take</l>
     <l n="62">their poor dear souls to Heaven !</l>
     <l n="63">Now you may both say Amen , and I shall give out hymn four hundred</l>
     <l n="64">and thirty-seven . ”</l>
     <l n="65">There are eight verses and eight Alleluias , and we can n't sing very</l>
     <l n="66">well , but we did our best ,</l>
     <l n="67">Only Mary would cry in the verse about “ Soon , soon to faithful</l>
     <l n="68">warriors comes their rest ! ”</l>
     <l n="69">But we 're both very glad Dick has found out a Sunday game about</l>
     <l n="70">fighting , for we never had one before ;</l>
     <l n="71">And now we can play at soldiers every day till Old Father comes</l>

    <head>MOTHER 'S BIRTHDAY REVIEW .</head>
    <head>BROTHER BILL .</head>
    <head>To have a good birthday for a grown-up person is very difficult indeed ; We do n't give it up , for Mother says the harder things are , the harder you must try till you succeed . Still , our birthdays are different ; we want so many things , and choosing your own pudding , and even half-holidays are treats ; But what can you do for people who always order the dinner , and never have lessons , and do n't even like sweets ? I know Mother does not . Baby put a big red comfit in her mouth , and I saw her take it out again on the sly ; I do n't believe she even enjoys going a-gypseying , for she gets neuralgia if she stands about where it is n't dry . And how can you boil the kettle if you 're not near the brook ? But it 's the last time she shall go there , I told her so ; I said , “ What 's the good of having five sons , except to mount guard over you , you Queen of all Mothers that ever were ? ” But she 's not easy to manage , and she shams sometimes , and shamming is a thing I can n't bear . She shammed about the red comfit , when she did n't think Baby could see her ; And ( because they 're the only things we can think of for birthday presents for her ) she shams wearing out a needle-book and a pin-cushion every year . The only things we can think of for Father are paper-cutters ; but there 's no sham about his wearing them out ; He would always lose them , long before his next birthday , if Mother did not keep finding them lying about . Last year 's paper-cutter was as big as a sword ( not as big as Father 's sword , but as big as a wooden one , like ours ) , And he left it behind in a railway-carriage , when he 'd had it just thirty-six hours ; So we knew he was ready for another . It was Mother 's birthday that bothered us so ;</head>

   <p>And if it had n't been for Dolly 's Major ( he 's her Godfather , and she calls him “ my Major ” ) , what we should have done I really do n't know ! He said , “ What 's the matter ? ” And Dolly said , “ Mother 's birthday 's the matter . ” And I said , “ We can n't think what to devise To give her a birthday treat that wo n't give her neuralgia , and will take her by surprise . Look here , Major ! How can you give people treats who can order what they wish for far better than you ? I wonder what they do for the Queen !— her birthday must be the hardest of all . ” But he said , “ Not a bit of it ! They have a review : Cocked hats and all the rest of it ; and a salute , and a feu de joie , and a March-Past . That 's the way we keep the Queen 's Birthday ; and every year the same as the last . ” So I settled at once to have a Mother 's Birthday Review ; and that she should be Queen , and I should be the General in command . I thought she could n't come to any harm by sitting in a fur cloak and a birthday wreath at the window , and bowing and waving her hand . We did not tell her what was coming , we only asked for leave to have all the seven donkeys for an hour and a half ; ( We always hire them from the same old man ) — two for the girls , and five for me and my brothers — I told him , “ for me and my Staff . ” We could have managed with five , if the girls would only have been Maids of Honour , and stayed indoors with the Queen . Maggie would if I 'd asked her ; but Dolly will go her own way , and that 's into the thick of everything , to see whatever there is to be seen . She 's only four years old , but she 's ridiculously like the picture of an ancient ancestress of ours Who defended an old castle in Cornwall , against the French , for hours and hours . Her husband was away , so she was in command , and all her household obeyed her ; She made them strip the lead off the roofs , and they did , and she boiled it down and gave it very hot indeed to the French invader .<span corresp="#note5" type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>Maggie would have let the French in ; she does n't like me to say so , but I know she would ,— you can get anything out of Maggie by talking .</p>

   <p>She likes to hire a donkey , and then sham she 'd rather not ride , for fear of being too heavy ; and to take Spike out for a run , and then carry him to save him the trouble of walking . But she 's very good ; she made all our cocked hats , and at the review she and Dolly and Spike were the loyal crowd . Dick and Tom and Harry were the troops , and I was the General , and Mother looked quite like a Queen at the window , and bowed . The donkeys made very good chargers on the whole , and especially mine ; Jem 's was the only one that gave trouble , and neither fair means nor foul would keep him in line . Just when I 'd dressed all their noses to a nice level ( you can do nothing with their ears ) , then back went Jem 's brute , And Jem caught him a whack with the flat of his sword ( a thing you never see done on the Staff ) , and it rather spoilt the salute ; But the spirit of the troops was excellent , and we 'd a feu de joie with penny pistols ( Jem 's donkey was the only one that shied ) , and Dolly 's Major says that , all things considered , he never saw a better March-Past ; And Mother was delighted with her first Birthday Review , and she is none the worse for it , and says she only hopes that it wo n't be the last .</p>

   <p>DOLLY .</p>
   <p>They call me Dolly , but I 'm not a doll , and I 'm not a baby , though Baby is sometimes my name ; I behave beautifully at meals , and at church , and I can put on my own boots , and can say a good deal of the Catechism , and ride a donkey , and play at any boys ’ game . I 've ridden a donkey that kicks ( at least I rode him as long as I was on ) , and a donkey that rolls , and an old donkey that goes lame . I mean to ride like a lady now , but that 's because I ought , not because I easily can ; For what with your legs and your pommels ( I mean the saddle 's pommels ) , it would be much easier always to ride like a man . Boys look braver , but I think it 's really more dangerous to ride sideways , because of the saddle slipping round . ( I did n't cry ; I played at slipping round the world , and getting to New Zealand with my head upside down on the ground . ) The reason the saddle is slippery is not because it 's smooth , for it 's rather rough ; and there 's a hard ridge behind , And the horse 's hair coming through the donkey 's back ( I mean through his saddle ) scratches you dreadfully ; but I tuck my things under me , and pretend I do n't mind . They work out again though , particularly when they are starched , and I think frocks get shorter every time they go to the wash ; But I do n't complain ; if it 's very uncomfortable , I make an ugly face to myself , and say , “ Bosh ! ” We 've all of us had a good deal of practice , so we ought to know how to ride ; We 've ridden a great deal since we came to live on the Heath , and we rode a good deal when Father was stationed at the sea-side . My Major taught me to ride sideways , and at first he would hold me on ; But I do n't like being touched ; and I do n't call it riding like a lady if you 're held on by an officer , and I 'd rather tumble off if I can n't stick on by myself ; so I sent him away , and the nasty saddle slipped round directly he was gone . I only crushed my sun-bonnet , and the donkey stood quite still . ( We always call that one “ the old stager . ” ) I was n't frightened , except just the tiniest bit ; but he says he was dreadfully frightened . So I said , “ Then you ought to be ashamed of yourself , considering all your medals , and that you 're a Major . ” He likes me very much , and I like him , and when my fifth birthday comes , he says I 'm to choose a donkey , and he 'll buy it for me , but the saddle and bridle shall be quite new ; So I 've made up my mind to choose the one Brother Bill had for his charger at Mother 's Birthday Review ; And Maggie is so glad , she says her life is quite miserable with thinking how miserable other lives are , if only we knew . Maggie loves every creature that lives ; she wo n't confess to black beetles , but she can n't stamp on them ( I 've stamped out lots in my winter boots ) , and she does n't even think a donkey ugly when he brays ; And she says she shall buy a brush , out of her pocket-money , and brush my donkey every day till he looks like a horse , and that it sha n't be her fault if there is n't one poor old brute beast who lives happily to the end of his days .</p>

   <p>The dew falls over the Heath , Brother Donkeys , and the darkness falls , but still through the gathering night All around us spreads the Heath Bed-straw<span corresp="#note6" type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>in glimmering sheets of white . Dragged and trampled , and plucked and wasted , it patiently spreads and survives ; Kicked and thwacked , and prodded and over-laden , we patiently cling to our lives . Hee-haw ! for the rest and silence of darkness that follow the labours of light . Hee-haw ! for the hours from night to morning , that balance the hours from morning to night . Hee-haw ! for the sweet night air that gives human beings cold in the head . Hee-haw ! for the civilization that sends human beings to bed . Rest , Brother Donkeys , rest , from the bit , the burden , the blow , The dust , the flies , the restless children , the brutal roughs , the greedy donkey-master , the greedier donkey-hirer , the holiday-maker who knows no better , and the holiday-makers who ought to know ! When the odorous furze-bush prickles the seeking nose , and the short damp grass refreshes the tongue ,— lend , Brother Donkeys , lend a long and attentive ear ! Whilst I proudly bray Of the one bright day In our hard and chequered career . I 've dragged pots , and vegetables , and invalids , and fish , and I 've galloped with four costermongers to the races ; I 've carried babies , and sea-coal , and sea-sand , and sea-weed in panniers , and been sold to the gypsies , and been bought back for the sea-side , and ridden ( in a white saddle-cloth with scarlet braid ) by the fashionable visitors . ( There was always a certain distinction in my paces , Though I say it who should n't ) I 've spent a summer on the Heath , and next winter near Covent Garden , and moved the following year to the foot of a mountain , to take people up to the top to show them the view . But how little we know what 's before us ! And how little I guessed I should ever be chief charger at a Queen 's Birthday Review ! Did I triumph alone ? No , Brother Donkeys , no ! You also took your place with the defenders of the nation ; Subordinate positions to my own , but meritoriously filled , though a little more style would have well become so great an occasion . That malevolent old Moke — may his next thistle choke him !— disgraced us all with his jibbing — the ill-tempered old ass ! Young Neddy is shaggy and shy , but not amiss , if he 'd held his ears up , and not kept his eyes on the grass . Nothing is more je-june ( I may say vulgar ) than to seem anxious to eat when the crisis calls for public spirit , enthusiasm , and an elevated tone ; And I wish , Brother Donkeys , I wish that all had felt as I felt , the responsibility of a March-Past the Throne ! Respect and self-respect delicately blended ; one ear up , and the other lowered to salute , as I passed the window from which we were seen ( Unless I grievously misunderstood the young General this morning ,) by no less a personage than her Most Gracious Majesty THE QUEEN . Sleep , Brother Donkeys , sleep ! But I fancy you 're sleeping already , for you make no reply ; Not a quiver of your ears , not a sign from your motionless drooping noses , dark against the dusky night sky . As black and immovable as the silent fir-trees you solemnly slumber beneath , Whilst I wakefully meditate on a glorious past , and painfully ponder the future , as the dews fall over the Heath .</p>

    <head>CONVALESCENCE .</head>
    <head>Hold my hand , little Sister , and nurse my head , whilst I try to remember the word , What was it ?— that the doctor says is now fairly established both in me and my bird . C-O-N-con , with a con , S-T-A-N-stan , with a stan — No ! That 's Constantinople , that is The capital of the country where rhubarb-and-magnesia comes from , and I wish they would keep it in that country , and not send it to this . C-O-N-con — how my head swims ! Now I 've got it ! C-O-N-V-A-L-E-S-C-E-N-C-E. Convalescence ! And that 's what the doctor says is now fairly established both in my blackbird and me . He says it means that you are better , and that you 'll be well by and by . And so the Sea-captain says , and he says we ought to be friends , because we 're both convalescents — at least we 're all three convalescents , my blackbird , and the Captain and I . He 's a sea-captain , not a land-captain , but , all the same , he was in the war , And he fought ,— for I asked him ,— and he 's been ill ever since , and that 's why he 's not afloat , but ashore ; And why somebody else has got his ship ; and she behaved so beautifully in the battle , and he loves her quite as much as his wife , and rather better than the rest of his relations , for I asked him ; and now he 's afraid she will never belong to him any more . I like him . I 've seen him three times out walking with two sticks , when I was driving in the bath-chair , but I never talked to him till to-day . He 'd only one stick and a telescope , and he let me look through it at the big ship that was coming round the corner into the bay . He was very kind , and let me ask questions . I said , “ Are you a sea-captain ? ” and he said , “ Yes . ” And I said , “ How funny it is about land things and sea things ! There are captains and sea-captains , and weeds and sea-weeds , and serpents and sea-serpents . Did you ever meet one , and is it really like the dragons on our very old best blue tea-things ? ” But he never did . So I asked him , “ Have you got convalescence ? Does your doctor say it is fairly established ? Do your eyes ache if you try to read , and your neck if you draw , and your back if you sit up , and your head if you talk ? Do n't you get tired of doing nothing , and worse tired still if you do anything ; and does everything wobble about when you walk ? Would n't you rather go back to bed ? I think I would . Do n't you wish you were well ? Would n't you rather be ill than only better ? I do hate convalescence , do n't you ? ” Then I stopped asking , and he shut up his telescope , and sat down on the shingle , and said , “ When you come to my age , little chap , you wo n't think ‘ What is it I 'd rather have ? ’ but , ‘ What is it I 've got to do ? ’ ‘ What have I got to do or to bear ; and how can I do it or bear it best ? ’ That 's the only safe point to make for , my lad . Make for it , and leave the rest ! ” I said , “ But would n't you rather be in battles than in bed , with your head aching as if it would split ? ” And he said , “ Of course I would ; so would most men . But , my little convalescent , that 's not it . What would you think of a man who was ordered into battle , and went grumbling and wishing he were in bed ? ” “ What should I think of the fellow ? Why , I should know he was a coward , ” I said . “ And if he were confined to bed , ” said the Sea-captain , “ and lay grumbling and wishing he were in battle , I should give him no better a name ; For the courage that dares , and the courage that bears , are really one and the same . ” Hold my hand , little Sister , and nurse my head , for I 'm thinking , and I very much fear You 've had no good of being well since I was ill ; I 've led you such a life ; but indeed I am obliged to you , dear ! Is it true that Nurse has got something the matter with her legs , and that Mary has gone home because she 's worn out with nursing , And wo n't be fit to work for months ? ( will she be convalescent , because it was such hard work waiting on me ? ) and did Cook say , “ So much grumbling and complaining is nigh as big a sin as swearing and cursing ” ? I wish I had n't been so cross with poor Mary , and I wish I had n't given so much trouble about my medicine and my food . I did n't think about her . I only thought what a bother it was . I wish I had n't thought so much about being miserable , that I never thought of trying to be good . I believe the Sea-captain is right , and I shall tell him so to-morrow , when he comes here to tea ; He 's going to look at my blackbird 's leg , and if it is really set , he wants me to let it go free . He says captivity is worse than convalescence , and so I should think it must be . Are you tired , little Sister ? You feel shaky . Do n't beg my pardon ; I beg yours . I 've not let you go out of my sight for weeks . Get your things on , and have a gallop on Jack . Ride round this way and let me see you . I wo n't say a word about wishing I was going too ; and if my head gets bad whilst you 're away , I will bear it my very best till you come back . Tell me one thing before you start . If I learn to be patient , shall I learn to be brave , do you think ? The Sea-captain says so . He says , “ Self-command is the making of a man , ” and he 's a finely-made man himself , so he ought to know . Perhaps , if I try hard at Convalescence now , I may become a brave sea-captain hereafter , and take my beautiful ship into battle , and bring her out again with flying colours and fame , If the courage that dares , and the courage that bears , are really one and the same .</head>
