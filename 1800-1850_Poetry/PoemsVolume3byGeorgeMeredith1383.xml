     <l n="85">With her witch-whisper o'er ruins , in reeds ,</l>
     <l n="86">She sang low the song of her promise delayed ;</l>

     <l n="93">For the honours of manhood more than the prize ;</l>
     <l n="94">Waved her magnetical yoke</l>
     <l n="95">Whither the warrior bled ,</l>
     <l n="96">Ere to the bower of sighs .</l>
     <l n="97">And shy of her secrets she was ; under deeps</l>
     <l n="98">Plunged at the breath of a thirst that woke</l>
     <l n="99">The dream in the cave where the Dreaded sleeps .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Away over heaven the young heart flew , And caught many lustres , till some one said ( Or was it the thought into hearing grew ? ) , NOT THOU AS COMMONER MEN ! Thy stature puffed and it swayed , It stiffened to royal-erect ; A brassy trumpet brayed ; A whirling seized thy head ; The vision of beauty was flecked . Note well the how and the when , The thing that prompted and sped . Thereanon the keen passions clapped wing , Fixed eye , and the world was prey . No simple world of thy greenblade Spring , Nor world of thy flowerful prime On the topmost Orient peak Above a yet vaporous day . Flesh was it , breast to beak : A four-walled windowless world without ray , Only darkening jets on a river of slime , Where harsh over music as woodland jay , A voice chants , Woe to the weak ! And along an insatiate feast , Women and men are one In the cup transforming to beast . Magian worship they paid to their sun , Lord of the Purse ! Behold him climb . Stalked ever such figure of fun For monarch in great-grin pantomime ? See now the heart dwindle , the frame distend ; The soul to its anchorite cavern retreat , From a life that reeks of the rotted end ; While he — is he pictureable ? replete , Gourd-like swells of the rank of the soil , Hollow , more hollow at core . And for him did the hundreds toil Despised ; in the cold and heat , This image ridiculous bore On their shoulders for morsels of meat !</p>

And ask , whether Wisdom is born of blood-heat ; Or of other than Wisdom comes victory here ; -  Aught more than the banquet and roundelay , That is closed with a terrible terminal wail , A retributive black ding-dong ? And ask of thyself : This furious Yea Of a speech I thump to repeat , In the cause I would have prevail , For seed of a nourishing wheat , IS IT ACCEPTED OF SONG ? Does it sound to the mind through the ear , Right sober , pure sane ? has it disciplined feet ? Thou wilt find it a test severe ; Unerring whatever the theme . Rings it for Reason a melody clear , We have bidden old Chaos retreat ; We have called on Creation to hear ; All forces that make us are one full stream . Simple islander ! thus may the spirit in verse , Showing its practical value and weight , Pipe to thee clear from the Empty Purse , Lead thee aloft to that high estate . - The test is conclusive , I deem : It embraces or mortally bites . We have then the key-note for debate : A Senate that sits on the heights Over discords , to shape and amend .</p>

   <p>Can an enemy wither his cheer ? Not you , ye fair yellow-flowering ladies , Who join with your lords to jar the chords of a bosom heroic , and clog . ‘ Tis the faltering friend , an inanimate land , may drag a great soul to their Hades , And plunge him far from a beam of star till he hears the deep bay of the Dog .</p>

     <l n="2">How big of breast our Mother Gaea laughed</l>

     <l n="4">Each over other as they neighboured home ,</l>
     <l n="5">Fronting the day 's descent across green slopes ,</l>
     <l n="6">And up fired mountain crags their shadows danced .</l>
     <l n="7">Close with them in their fun , she scarce could guess ,</l>
     <l n="8">Though these two billowy urchins reeked of craft ,</l>
     <l n="9">It signalled some adventurous master-trick</l>

     <l n="27">Through gurglings of triumphant jollity ,</l>
     <l n="28">Which now engulphed and now gave eye ; at last</l>

     <l n="33">These two made up of lion , bear and fox ,</l>
     <l n="34">Her sportive , suckling mammoths , her young joy ,</l>
     <l n="35">Still by the reckoning infants among men ,</l>
     <l n="36">Had done the deed to strike the Titan host</l>
     <l n="37">In envy dumb , in envious heart elate :</l>

     <l n="41">Destroyer , ravager , superb in plumes ;</l>
     <l n="42">The barren furrower of anointed fields ;</l>
     <l n="43">The scarlet heel in towns , foul smoke to sky ,</l>
     <l n="44">Her hated enemy , too long her scourge :</l>
     <l n="45">Great Ares . And they gagged his trumpet mouth</l>
     <l n="46">When they had seized on his implacable spear ,</l>
     <l n="47">Hugged him to reedy helplessness despite</l>
     <l n="48">His godlike fury startled from amaze .</l>
     <l n="49">For he had eyed them nearing him in play ,</l>
     <l n="50">The giant cubs , who gambolled and who snarled ,</l>

     <l n="56">Good servitors of Ares they would be ,</l>
     <l n="57">And ply the pointed spear to dominate</l>
     <l n="58">Their rebel restless fellows , villain brood</l>
     <l n="59">Vowed to defy Immortals . So it chanced</l>
     <l n="60">Amusedly he watched them , and as one</l>
     <l n="61">The lusty twain were on him and they had him .</l>
     <l n="62">Breath to us , Powers of air , for laughter loud !</l>
     <l n="63">Cock of Olympus he , superb in plumes !</l>

     <l n="77">Prompting the Dexterous to work his arts ,</l>

     <l n="89">Her ready secret : the abounding life</l>
     <l n="90">Returned for valiant labour : she and they</l>

     <l n="92">By loss enriched , by overthrow restored .</l>
     <l n="93">Exchange of powers of this conflict came ;</l>

     <l n="101">Stability in hatred of the insane ,</l>
     <l n="102">Man stepped ; with wits less fearful to pronounce</l>

     <l n="107">Earth in her happy children asked that word ,</l>

     <l n="118">The Tyranny . This her voice within them told ,</l>
     <l n="119">When softly the Great Mother chid her sons</l>
     <l n="120">Not of the giant brood , who did create</l>
     <l n="121">Those lawless Gods , first offspring of our brain</l>
     <l n="122">Set moving by an abject blood , that waked</l>
     <l n="123">To wanton under elements more benign ,</l>
     <l n="124">And planted aliens on Olympian heights ; -</l>

     <l n="130">For earth 's beneficent , the sons of Law ,</l>
     <l n="131">Her other name . So spake she in their heart ,</l>
     <l n="132">Among the wheat-blades proud of stalk ; beneath</l>
     <l n="133">Young vine-leaves pushing timid fingers forth ,</l>
     <l n="134">Confidently to cling . And when brown corn</l>
     <l n="135">Swayed armied ranks with softened cricket song ,</l>
     <l n="136">With gold necks bent for any zephyr 's kiss ;</l>
     <l n="137">When vine-roots daily down a rubble soil</l>
     <l n="138">Drank fire of heaven athirst to swell the grape ;</l>
     <l n="139">When swelled the grape , and in it held a ray ,</l>
     <l n="140">Rich issue of the embrace of heaven and earth ;</l>
     <l n="141">The very eye of passion drowsed by excess ,</l>
     <l n="142">And yet a burning lion for the spring ;</l>
     <l n="143">Then in that time of general cherishment ,</l>
     <l n="144">Sweet breathing balm and flutes by cool wood-side ,</l>
     <l n="145">He the harsh rouser of ire being absent , caged ,</l>
     <l n="146">Then did good Gaea 's children gratefully</l>
     <l n="147">Lift hymns to Gods they judged , but praised for peace ,</l>
     <l n="148">Delightful Peace , that answers Reason 's call</l>
     <l n="149">Harmoniously and images her Law ;</l>
     <l n="150">Reflects , and though short-lived as then , revives ,</l>
     <l n="151">In memories made present on the brain</l>
     <l n="152">By natural yearnings , all the happy scenes ;</l>
     <l n="153">The picture of an earth allied to heaven ;</l>
     <l n="154">Between them the known smile behind black masks ;</l>
     <l n="155">Rightly their various moods interpreted ;</l>
     <l n="156">And frolic because toilful children borne</l>
     <l n="157">With larger comprehension of Earth 's aim</l>
     <l n="158">At loftier , clearer , sweeter , by their aid .</l>

     <l n="14">In and out of woody glen ,</l>
     <l n="15">Under cliffs that tear the blue ,</l>
     <l n="16">Over torrent , over fen ,</l>
     <l n="17">She and forest , where she skims</l>
     <l n="18">Feathery , darken and relume :</l>
     <l n="19">Those are her white-lightning limbs</l>
     <l n="20">Cleaving loads of leafy gloom .</l>
     <l n="21">Mountains hear her and call back ,</l>
     <l n="22">Shrewd with night : a frosty wail</l>
     <l n="23">Distant : her the emerald vale</l>
     <l n="24">Folds , and wonders in her track .</l>
     <l n="25">Now her retinue is lean ,</l>
     <l n="26">Many rearward ; streams the chase</l>
     <l n="27">Eager forth of covert ; seen</l>
     <l n="28">One hot tide the rapturous race .</l>
     <l n="29">Quiver-charged and crescent-crowned ,</l>
     <l n="30">Up on a flash the lighted mound</l>
     <l n="31">Leaps she , bow to shoulder , shaft</l>
     <l n="32">Strung to barb with archer 's craft ,</l>
     <l n="33">Legs like plaited lyre-chords , feet</l>
     <l n="34">Songs to see , past pitch of sweet .</l>
     <l n="35">Fearful swiftness they outrun ,</l>
     <l n="36">Shaggy wildness , grey or dun ,</l>
     <l n="37">Challenge , charge of tusks elude :</l>
     <l n="38">Theirs the dance to tame the rude ;</l>
     <l n="39">Beast , and beast in manhood tame ,</l>
     <l n="40">Follow we their silver flame .</l>
     <l n="41">Pride of flesh from bondage free ,</l>
     <l n="42">Reaping vigour of its waste ,</l>
     <l n="43">Marks her servitors , and she</l>
     <l n="44">Sanctifies the unembraced .</l>
     <l n="45">Nought of perilous she reeks ;</l>
     <l n="46">Valour clothes her open breast ;</l>
     <l n="47">Sweet beyond the thrill of sex ;</l>
     <l n="48">Hallowed by the sex confessed .</l>
     <l n="49">Huntress arrowy to pursue ,</l>
     <l n="50">Colder she than sunless dew ,</l>
     <l n="51">She , that breath of upper air ;</l>
     <l n="52">Ay , but never lyrist sang ,</l>
     <l n="53">Draught of Bacchus never sprang</l>
     <l n="54">Blood the bliss of Gods to share ,</l>
     <l n="55">High o'er sweep of eagle wings ,</l>
     <l n="56">Like the run with her , when rings</l>
     <l n="57">Clear her rally , and her dart ,</l>
     <l n="58">In the forest 's cavern heart ,</l>
     <l n="59">Tells of her victorious aim .</l>
     <l n="60">Then is pause and chatter , cheer ,</l>
     <l n="61">Laughter at some satyr lame ,</l>
     <l n="62">Looks upon the fallen deer ,</l>
     <l n="63">Measuring his noble crest ;</l>
     <l n="64">Here a favourite in her train ,</l>
     <l n="65">Foremost mid her nymphs , caressed ;</l>
     <l n="66">All applauded . Shall she reign</l>
     <l n="67">Worshipped ? O to be with her there !</l>
     <l n="68">She , that breath of nimble air ,</l>
     <l n="69">Lifts the breast to giant power .</l>
     <l n="70">Maid and man , and man and maid ,</l>
     <l n="71">Who each other would devour</l>
     <l n="72">Elsewhere , by the chase betrayed ,</l>
     <l n="73">There are comrades , led by her ,</l>
     <l n="74">Maid-preserver , man-maker .</l>

     <l n="3">Where nought is visible can make appear</l>
     <l n="4">A veil with eyes that waver through ,</l>
     <l n="5">Like twilight 's pledge of blessed night to come ,</l>
     <l n="6">Or day most golden ? All unseen and dumb ,</l>
     <l n="7">She breathes , she moves , inviting flees ,</l>
     <l n="8">Is lost , and leaves the thrilled desire</l>
     <l n="9">To clasp and strike a slackened lyre ,</l>
     <l n="10">Till over smiles of hyacinth seas ,</l>
     <l n="11">Flame in a crystal vessel sails</l>
     <l n="12">Beneath a dome of jewelled spray ,</l>
     <l n="13">For land that drops the rosy day</l>

     <l n="18">On rapturous waves we saw her glide ;</l>
     <l n="19">The pearly sea-shell half enclose ;</l>
     <l n="20">The shoal of sea-nymphs flush the tide ;</l>
     <l n="21">And we , afire to kiss her feet , no more</l>

     <l n="46">The sovereign loveliness of celestial white ;</l>
     <l n="47">Adored by them who solitarily pace ,</l>
     <l n="48">In dusk of the underworld 's perpetual eve ,</l>
     <l n="49">The paths among the meadow asphodel ,</l>

     <l n="52">Around such whiteness the enamoured air</l>
     <l n="53">Of noon that clothes her , never there .</l>
     <l n="54">Daughter of light , the joyful light ,</l>

     <l n="58">A fountain jets from moss ; a flower</l>
     <l n="59">Bends gently where her sunset tresses shower .</l>
     <l n="60">By guerdon of her brilliance may be seen</l>
     <l n="61">With eyelids unabashed the passion 's Queen .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="62">Shorn of attendant Graces she can use</l>
     <l n="63">Her natural snares to make her will supreme .</l>
     <l n="64">A simple nymph it is , inclined to muse</l>
     <l n="65">Before the leader foot shall dip in stream :</l>
     <l n="66">One arm at curve along a rounded thigh ;</l>
     <l n="67">Her firm new breasts each pointing its own way</l>
     <l n="68">A knee half bent to shade its fellow shy ,</l>
     <l n="69">Where innocence , not nature , signals nay .</l>
     <l n="70">The bud of fresh virginity awaits</l>
     <l n="71">The wooer , and all roseate will she burst :</l>
     <l n="72">She touches on the hour of happy mates ;</l>

     <l n="79">Is lost to float like torch-smoke after flame ;</l>
     <l n="80">The phantom any breeze blows out of form ;</l>
     <l n="81">A thirst 's delusion , a defeated aim .</l>

     <l n="82">The rapture shed the torture weaves ;</l>

     <l n="85">Nought true but what insufferably feels .</l>
     <l n="86">And stabs of her delicious note ,</l>
     <l n="87">That is as heavenly light to hearing , heard</l>
     <l n="88">Through shelter leaves , the laughter from her throat ,</l>

     <l n="90">She laughs , she wakens gleeful cries ;</l>

     <l n="97">Consume the fruit in bloom ; not disobeyed .</l>
     <l n="98">We dolorous complainers had a dream ,</l>
     <l n="99">Wrought on the vacant air from inner fire ,</l>
     <l n="100">We saw stand bare of her celestial beam</l>

     <l n="110">The generous Goddess yields . And she can arm</l>
     <l n="111">Her dwarfed and twisted with her secret charm ;</l>
     <l n="112">Benevolent as Earth to feed her own .</l>
     <l n="113">Fully shall they be fed , if they beseech .</l>
     <l n="114">But scorn she has for them that walk alone ;</l>
     <l n="115">Blanched men , starved women , whom no arts can pleach .</l>
     <l n="116">The men as chief of criminals she disdains ,</l>
     <l n="117">And holds the reason in perceptive thought .</l>
     <l n="118">More pitiable , like rivers lacking rains ,</l>
     <l n="119">Kissing cold stones , the women shrink for drought .</l>
     <l n="120">Those faceless discords , out of nature strayed ,</l>
     <l n="121">Rank of the putrefaction ere decayed ,</l>
     <l n="122">In impious singles bear the thorny wreaths :</l>
     <l n="123">Their lives are where harmonious Pleasure breathes</l>
     <l n="124">For couples crowned with flowers that burn in dew .</l>
     <l n="125">Comes there a tremor of night 's forest horn</l>
     <l n="126">Across her garden from the insaner crew ,</l>
     <l n="127">She darkens to malignity of scorn .</l>
     <l n="128">A shiver courses through her garden-grounds :</l>
     <l n="129">Grunt of the tusky boar , the baying hounds ,</l>
     <l n="130">The hunter 's shouts , are heard afar , and bring</l>
     <l n="131">Dead on her heart her crimsoned flower of Spring .</l>
     <l n="132">These , the irreverent of Life 's design ,</l>
     <l n="133">Division between natural and divine</l>
     <l n="134">Would cast ; these vaunting barrenness for best ,</l>
     <l n="135">In veins of gathered strength Life 's tide arrest ;</l>
     <l n="136">And these because the roses flood their cheeks ,</l>
     <l n="137">Vow them in nature wise as when Love speaks .</l>
     <l n="138">With them is war ; and well the Goddess knows</l>
     <l n="139">What undermines the race who mount the rose ;</l>
     <l n="140">How the ripe moment , lodged in slumberous hours ,</l>
     <l n="141">Enkindled by persuasion overpowers :</l>
     <l n="142">Why weak as are her frailer trailing weeds ,</l>

     <l n="144">And timely guile unguarded finds them lie .</l>
     <l n="145">They who her sway withstand a sea defy ,</l>
     <l n="146">At every point of juncture must be proof ;</l>
     <l n="147">Nor look for mercy from the incessant surge</l>
     <l n="148">Her forces mixed of craft and passion urge</l>
     <l n="149">For the one whelming wave to spring aloof .</l>
     <l n="150">She , tenderness , is pitiless to them</l>

     <l n="152">No flower their face shall be , but writhen stem ;</l>
     <l n="153">Their youth a frost , their age the dirge for youth .</l>

     <l n="1">When comes the lighted day for men to read</l>
