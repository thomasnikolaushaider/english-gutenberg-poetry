    <p>( hand-written letter ) Franz Hueffer who came into the Rossetti circle in the manner indicated in the following letter ( of which the greater part is in the writing of the late Lucy Rossetti -  daughter of Ford Madox Brown ) was a broad-headed , plodding , able German who wrote and spoke English perfectly enough before his naturalization . He was somewhat heavy in his enthusiasms ; and Gabriel Rossetti laughed at him a good deal . On one occasion D. G. R . let off the following “ nursery rhyme ":— There 's a fluffy-haired German called Huffer A loud and pragmatical duffer : To stand on a tower And shout “ Schopenhauer ” Is reckoned his mission by Huffer . There was no malice in these rhymes of Rossetti 's ; but even his dear friend Morris ( “ Topsy ” as his intimates called him on account of his shock of black hair ) was not exempt from personal sallies of the kind ,— as this , when M. got alarmed about his increasing bulk :— There was a young person called Topsy Who fancied he suffered from dropsy ; He shook like a jelly , Till the Doctor cried “ Belly ! ” — Which angered ; but comforted Topsy . Poor dear Morris ! he had cause enough for alarm . Diabetes was only one among the agencies by which his stalwart frame was disintegrated at the age of 62 . H. B. F .</p>

   <p>MEMOIR</p>
   <p>OF</p>
   <p>WILLIAM MORRIS .</p>
   <p>William Morris , poet , decorative designer and socialist , was born in 1834 at Clay Street , Walthamstow , now almost a suburb of London , at that time a country village in Essex . He went to school at Marlborough College and thence to Exeter College , Oxford , where he took his degree in 1857 . During his stay in the University the subsequent mode of his life was prepared and foreshadowed in two important directions . Like most poets Morris was not what is called very assiduous “ at his book ” ; the routine of college training was no more an attraction to him than the ordinary amusements and dissipations of undergraduate existence . But he was studious all the same , reading the classics in his own somewhat spasmodic way and exploring with even greater zeal the mysteries of mediaeval lore . His fellow-worker in these studies and his most intimate friend was and is at the present day Mr. Burne Jones , the famous painter , at that time a student of divinity . Artistic and literary pursuits thus went hand in hand , and received additional zest when the two young men became acquainted with Dante Gabriel Rossetti , Holman Hunt and other painters of the Pre-Raphaelite school who came to Oxford to execute the frescoes still dimly visible on the ceiling of the Union Debating Hall . Of the aims and achievements of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood , and of the revival of mediaeval feeling in art and literature originally advocated by its members ample account has been given in the memoir of Rossetti prefixed to his poems in the Tauchnitz edition . Its influence on Morris 's early work , both in matter and form , will strike every observant reader of the opening ballads of the present collection . Later on the poet worked out for himself a distinct and individual phase of the mediaeval movement , as will be mentioned by and by . At one time little was wanting to make Morris follow his friend Burne Jones 's example and leave the pen for the brush . There is indeed still extant from his hand an unfinished picture evincing a remarkable sense of colour . He also for a short time became a pupil of the late Mr. G. E. Street , the architect , to whose genius London owes its finest modern Gothic building — the Law Courts in the Strand . On second thoughts , however , Morris came to the conclusion that poetry was his true field of action . His first literary venture was a monthly periodical started under his auspices in 1856 and called The Oxford and Cambridge Magazine . It contained , amongst other contributions from Morris 's pen , a prose tale of a highly romantic character , and was , as regards artistic tendencies , essentially a sequel of The Germ , the organ of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood , begun and continued for three numbers only , six years before . Several of the contributors to the earlier venture , including Rossetti , also supported its offshoot . Neither , however , gained popular favour , and after a year 's struggling existence The Oxford and Cambridge Magazine also came to an untimely end . At present both are eagerly sought for by collectors and fetch high prices at antiquarian sales . So changeable is the fate of books .</p>
   <p>In 1859 Morris married , after having the year before brought out his first volume of verse entitled The Defence of Guenevere and Other Poems . The book fell dead from the press , and it was not till it was republished 25 years later that the world recognised in it some of the freshest and most individual efforts of its author , whose literary position was by that time established beyond cavil . That position the poet owed in the first instance to two works published in rapid succession , The Life and Death of Jason , and The Earthly Paradise , the latter a collection of tales in verse filling four stout volumes . His remaining original works are Love is enough , a “ morality ” in the mediaeval sense of the word , and The Story of Sigurd the Volsung , his longest and , in the opinion of some , his most perfect epic . In addition to these should be mentioned the translations from the old Norse undertaken in conjunction with Mr. Magnusson the well-known Icelandic scholar , and comprising The Story of Grettir the Strong ( 1869 ) , The Volsunga Saga , with certain songs from the Elder Edda ( 1870 ) , and Three Northern Love Stories ( 1875 ) ; and finally a metrical rendering of The Aeneids of Virgil .</p>
   <p>For a critical discussion or a detailed analysis of Morris 's work this is not the place . It must be sufficient to indicate briefly the ideas which underlie that work and give it its literary cachet . Two main currents , derivable perhaps from a common source but running in different directions can be easily discerned . The subjects of his tales are almost without exception derived either from Greek myth or from mediaeval folklore . After all that has been said and written of the gulf that divides the classic from the romantic feeling — “ Barbaren und Hellenen ” , as Heine puts it , such a conjunction might appear incongruous . But the connecting link has here been found in the poet 's mind . He looks upon his classical subject-matter through a mediaeval atmosphere , in other words he writes about Venus and Cupid and Psyche and Medea as a poet of Chaucer 's age might have done , barring of course the differences of language , although in this respect also it may be noted that the archaisms of expression affected by the modern poet appear indifferently in the Greek and the mediaeval tales . The phenomenon is by no means unique in literature . Let the reader compare Chapman 's Homer with Pope 's , or let him open Morris 's Jason where the bells of Colchis “ melodiously begin to ring ” , and the meaning of the afore-mentioned “ mediaeval atmosphere ” will at once be as palpable to him as it was to Keats when , reading Chapman 's rude verse , after Pope 's polished stanzas , he felt</p>
   <p>like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken .</p>
   <p>It was the romantic chord of Keats 's nature , that chord which vibrates in La belle Dame sans Merci , which was harmoniously struck and made the great master of form overlook the formal imperfection of the earlier poet . To the same element such stories as Jason , or The Love of Alcestis and the Bellerophon in The Earthly Paradise owe their charm .</p>
   <p>Morris 's position towards mediaeval subjects did not at first essentially differ from that of other poets of similar tendency . In his first volume English and French knights and damsels figure prominently , and the beautiful and frail wife of King Arthur is the heroine of the chief poem and has given her name to the book . But in the interval which elapsed between that volume and the Earthly Paradise a considerable change had come over the poet 's dream . By the aid of Mr. Magnusson he had become acquainted with the treasure of northern folklore hidden in the Icelandic sagas , the two Eddas , the story of the Volsungs ( of which a masterly translation is due to the two friends ) , the Laxdaela saga and other tales of more or less remote antiquity .</p>
   <p>In the Earthly Paradise the double current of the poet 's fancy above alluded to is most strikingly apparent . The very framework in which the various tales are set seems to have been designed with that view . Guided probably by a vague tradition of a pre-Columbian discovery of America by the Vikings , the prologue relates how during a terrible pestilence certain mariners leave their northern home in search of the land where old age and death are not and where life is rounded by unbroken pleasure . Sailing west they come to a fair country . They gaze on southern sunshine and virgin forest and fertile champaign , but death meets them at every step , and happiness is farthest from their grasp when the people worship them as gods and sacrifice at their shrine . Escaping from this golden thraldom they regain their ship , and after many dangers and privations are driven by the wind to an island inhabited by descendants of the ancient Greeks , who have preserved their old worship and their old freedom . Here the weary wanderers of the main are hospitably received , and here they resolve to dwell in peace , forgetful of their vain search for the earthly paradise . At the beginning and the middle of every month the elders of the people and their guests meet together to while away the time with song and friendly converse . The islanders relate the traditions of their Grecian home , the mariners relate the sagas of the North , and Laurence , a Swabian priest who had joined the Norsemen in their quest , contributes the legends of Tannhaeuser and of the ring given to Venus by the Roman youth . Here then there is full scope for the quaint beauty of romantic classicism and for the weird glamour of northern myth . Without encroaching upon the field of criticism proper the writer may state that , in his opinion , amongst the classic tales none is more graceful and finished than “ The Golden Apples ” , and amongst the northern none more grandly developed and more epical in the strict sense of the word than The Lovers of Gudrun based upon the Icelandic Laxdaela saga . The latter , unfortunately , cannot find a place in this volume for reasons of space .</p>
   <p>Every student of old northern literature is aware that amongst its remains none are more interesting as literary monuments , none more characteristic of the people from which they sprang than the two Eddas and the Volsunga Saga . Next to the Siege of Troy and the Arthurian legends perhaps no story or agglomeration of stories has left so many and so important traces in international fiction as the tale of Sigurd or Siegfried and his race , the heroic god-born Volsungs . Considering indeed the political insignificance and remoteness in which that story took its earliest surviving form this enormous success — if the modern term may be applied — seems at first singularly out of proportion . But it must be remembered that Iceland was little more than the storehouse of these old traditions which were the common property of the Teuto-Scandinavian race long before the Norsemen set foot on the northern isle . Of the two modern versions of the tale which are most thoroughly inspired by the ancient myth one , that of Wagner in his tetralogy Der Ring des Nibelungen , is dramatic in form , the other , Morris 's The Story of Sigurd the Volsung , bears all the characteristics of the epic . To this difference of artistic aim , the difference of shape which the tale takes in the hands of the two poets may be traced . In one point however they agree . Both Wagner and Morris go back to the old Icelandic sources in preference to the mediaeval German version of the tale embodied in the Nibelungenlied . From this the German poet borrows little more than the localization of his drama on the banks of the river Rhine , the English poet scarcely anything but his metre — the Langzeile or long-line with six hightoned , and any number of unaccentuated syllables .</p>
   <p>The ordinary modern reader taking up the Volsunga Saga or either of the Eddas without preparation would probably see in them little more than a confused accumulation of impossible adventures and deeds of prowess with an admixture of incest , fratricide and other horrors . But on looking closer one discovers a certain plan in this entanglement , a plan much obscured by the unbridled fancy of the old narrators , and hardly realised by themselves , but which , if properly sifted , amounts to what we should call a moral or idea . To “ point this moral , ” to consistently develop this idea , is the task of the modern poet courageous enough to grapple with such a subject . Two ways are open to him . Either he may wholly abandon the sequence of the old tale , and group its disjecta membra round a leading idea as a centre , or else he may adhere to the order and essence of the legend as originally told , only emphasising such points as are essential to the significance of the story , and omitting or throwing into comparative shade those incidents which by their nature betray themselves to be arbitrary additions of later date . Wagner has chosen the former way , Morris the latter . This fact , and the divergent requirements of the drama and the epic , sufficiently account for their difference of treatment . The leading idea in both cases remains the same ; it is the fatal curse which attaches to the gold or , which is the same in a moral sense , to the desire for gold — auri sacra fames .</p>
   <p>At first sight the tale of Sigurd , Fafnir 's bane , seems to have little connection with this idea . It is briefly this . Sigurd , the son of Sigmund the Volsung , is brought up at the court of King Elf , the second husband of his mother , after Sigmund has been slain in battle . With a sword , fashioned from the shards of his father 's weapon , he slays Fafnir , a huge worm or dragon , and possesses himself of the treasure watched by the monster , including a ring and the “ helm of aweing , ” the latter in the Nibelungenlied , converted into the “ Tarnkappe ” , a magic cap which makes the bearer invisible and endows him with supernatural strength . Tasting of the blood of the dragon , he understands the language of birds , and an eagle tells him of a beautiful maiden lying asleep on a rock called Hindfell , surrounded by a wall of wavering fire . Through it Sigurd rides and awakes Brynhild the sword maiden , or Valkyrie , from her magic slumber . Love naturally follows . The pair live together on Hindfell for a season and Brynhild teaches the youth the runes of her wisdom , a conception of woman 's refining and civilising mission frequently met with in old Germanic tales . When Sigurd leaves her to seek new adventures they plight the troth of eternal love , and</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Then he set the ring on her finger , and once if ne'er again</l>
     <l n="2">They kissed and clung together , and their hearts were full and fain .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>From Brynhild 's rock Sigurd journeys to a realm “ south of the Rhine ” where dwell the kingly brothers , Gunnar , Hogni , and Guttorm , the Niblungs , together with their sister Gudrun , “ the fairest of maidens ” , and their mother Grimhild , “ a wise wife ” and a fierce-hearted woman , as the Volsunga Saga alternately describes her . It is through a love-philter brewed by her that Sigurd forgets the vows exchanged with Brynhild , and becomes enamoured of Gudrun , whom he soon after weds . So powerful is the charm that the very name of his former love has been wiped from Sigurd 's memory , and he willingly undertakes the task to woo and win Brynhild for his brother Gunnar . For that purpose he , by means of his magic cap , assumes Gunnar 's semblance , and after having once more crossed the wall of wavering flame compels Brynhild to become his bride . But , faithful to his promise , he places a drawn sword between himself and the maid “ as they lie on one bed together . ” On parting from her he receives back from Brynhild his own ring given to her at Hindfell in the days of their bliss . Sigurd then returns to Gunnar and resumes his own form , and all return home , the King leading his unwilling bride in triumph .</p>
   <p>The subsequent events are the outgrowth of the tragic guilt thus incurred . Sigurd reveals the secret of Brynhild 's wooing to his wife , and allows her to take possession of the fatal ring , which she during a quarrel shows to Gunnar 's wife . Brynhild thus informed of the fraud practised on her , thinks of vengeance , and incites her husband and his brothers to kill Sigurd . The deed is done while Sigurd lies asleep in his chamber with Gudrun , or , according to the more poetic version of the German epic , while he bends over a brook in the forest to quench his thirst after a day 's hunting . But as soon as her beloved foe is killed the old passion never quenched rises up again in Brynhild 's heart . To be united with her lover in death she pierces her breast with a sword , and one pyre consumes both .</p>
   <p>With this climax Wagner very properly concludes his drama . But the epic poet likes to follow the course of events to their ultimate consequences , and Morris , in accordance with the Volsunga Saga , proceeds to relate how , after many years of mournful widowhood , Gudrun is married to Atli , a mighty king , the brother of Brynhild . Eager to become possessed of Sigurd 's treasure he invites the Niblungs , its actual owners , to his country , and there the kingly brothers and all their followers are killed by base treachery and after the most heroic resistance . They refuse sternly to ransom their lives by a discovery of the hoard which previous to their departure they have hidden at the bottom of a lake , and which thus is irrecoverably lost to mankind . Gudrun has incited her husband to the deed and has looked on calmly while her kinsmen were slain one after the other . But when all are dead and the murder of Sigurd has been revenged , the feeling of blood relationship so powerful among Northern nations is reawakened in her . While Atli and his earls are asleep she sets fire to the kingly hall , and her wretched husband falls by her own hand . It is characteristic of the Icelandic epic that after all these fates and horrors Gudrun lives for a number of years and is yet again married to a third husband . But to this length even Morris refuses to accompany the tale . In accordance with the Volsunga Saga his Gudrun throws herself into the sea ; but the waves do not carry her “ to the burg of king Imakr , a mighty king and lord of many folk . ”</p>
   <p>All this is very grand and weird , the reader will say , but where is the moral , the ideal essence of which these events are but the earthly reflex ? To this essence we gradually ascend by inquiring into the mythological sources of the tale , by asking who is Sigurd , whence does he come , on what mission is he sent and by whom ? also what is the significance of the treasure watched by a dragon and coveted by all mankind ? This treasure we then shall find and the curse attaching to it ever since it was robbed from Andvari , the water-elf , is the keynote of the whole story . The curse proves fatal to all its successive owners from Andvari himself and Fafnir , who , for its sake , kills his father , down to Sigurd and Brynhild and the Niblung brothers . Nay , Odin himself , the supreme God , becomes subject to the curse of the gold through having once coveted it , and we dimly discern that the ultimate doom of the Aesir , the Ragnaroek , or dusk of the Gods , of which the Voluspa speaks , is intimately connected with the same baneful influence . It further becomes evident that Sigurd the Volsung , the descendant of Odin , is destined to wrest the treasure and the power derived from it from the Niblungs , the dark or cloudy people who threaten the bright godworld of Valhall with destruction . And this leads us back to a still earlier stage of the myth in which Sigurd himself becomes the symbol of the celestial luminary conquering night and misty darkness , an idea repeatedly hinted at by Morris and splendidly illustrated by Wagner , when Siegfried appears on the stage illumined by the first rays of the rising sun . In the work of the German poet all this is brought out with a distinctness of which only dramatic genius of the highest order is capable . With an astounding grasp of detail and with a continuity of thought rarely equalled , Wagner has remoulded the confused and complex argument of the old tale , omitting what seemed unnecessary , and placing in juxtaposition incidents organically connected but separated by the obtuseness of later sagamen .</p>
   <p>Morris , as has been said before , proceeds on a different principle . His first object is to tell a tale , and to tell it as nearly as possible in the spirit and according to the letter of the old Sagas . In this he has succeeded in a manner at once indicative of his high poetic gifts and of a deep sympathy with the spirit of the Northern Myth , which breathes in every line and in every turn of his phraseology . To compare the peculiar tinge of his language with the ordinary archaisms and euphonisms of literary poets would be mistaking a field flower for its counterpart in a milliner 's shop window . It is true that he also hints at the larger philosophic and moral issues of the tale . But when he refers to the end of the gods brought about by their own guilt or to the redeeming mission of Sigurd , it is done in the mysterious , not to say half conscious manner of the saga itself , and the effect is such as from his own point of view he intended it and could not but intend it to be .</p>
   <p>Between the publication of The Defence of Guenevere and that of Jason ten years elapsed . During most of this time the poet was employed in artistic pursuits . In 1861 he started in conjunction with a number of friends the business of decorator and artistic designer which still bears his name . Growing from very modest beginnings this enterprise was destined to work an entire change in the external aspect of English homes . It soon extended its activity to every branch of art-workmanship . D. G. Rossetti , Madox Brown , and Burne Jones drew cartoons for the stained glass windows to be seen in many of our churches and colleges . Morris himself designed wall-papers and the patterns of carpets . The latter are woven on hand-looms in his factory at Merton Abbey , which stands on the banks of the river Wandle surrounded by orchards , and looks as like a medieval workshop as the modern dresses of the workgirls will allow . Another member of the firm , Philip Webb , was the first modern architect to build houses of red brick in the style vaguely and not quite correctly described as “ Queen Anne . ” At present these houses count by thousands in London and a whole village of them has been built at Turnham Green . The members of the firm did not confine their attention to any particular style or age or country . Wherever beautiful things could be found they collected them and made them popular . Old china English , and foreign , Japanese fans and screens , Venetian glass and German pottery were equally welcome to them and through them to the public generally . It may be said that the “ aesthetic ” fashion as it came to be called will like other fashions die out , and that people in the course of time will grow tired of “ living up to ” their furniture and dresses . At the same time the idea thus insisted upon that beauty is an essential and necessary ingredient of practical modern English life is not likely to be without beneficial and permanent effect .</p>
   <p>It was as artistic worker and employer of skilled labour that Morris imbibed that profound disgust with our social condition which induced him to adopt the principles of extreme socialism . For a long time his views had tended in that direction , and at the end of 1884 he joined the Socialist League , a body professing the doctrines of international revolutionary socialism . He is the editor of its official organ , the Commonweal , which contains many contributions from his pen both in prose and verse . That the poet has not been entirely sunk in the politician , that longing for beauty is at least the partial cause of this desire for change at any price , is however proved by such a sentiment as , “ Beauty , which is what is meant by art , using the word in its widest sense , is , I contend , no mere accident of human life which people can take or have as they choose , but a positive necessity of life , if we are to live as nature meant us to , that is unless we are content to be less than men , ” or by such a vision of a future earthly paradise as is expressed in the following lines :</p>
   <p>Then a man shall work and bethink him , and rejoice in the deeds of his hand , Nor yet come home in the even , too faint and weary to stand ,</p>
   <p>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">For that which the worker winneth shall then be his indeed ,</l>
     <l n="2">Nor shall half be reaped for nothing by him that sowed no seed .</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Then all mine and thine shall be ours , and no more shall any man crave For riches that serve for nothing but to fetter a friend for a slave .</p>
   <p>One may admire the pathetic beauty of such lines , without sharing the poet 's hope , that their import will ever be realised , in a world peopled by men and not by angels . History teaches and personal experience confirms that art enjoyment and art creation of the highest type must be confined to the few , and it is to be feared that social democracy , whatever it may do for the physical welfare of the many , will care little about beauty , either in nature or in art . The Demos will never admire Rossetti 's pictures or Keats 's poetry , and the first thing the much-vaunted peasant proprietors , or peasant communes would do would be to cut down our ancient trees , level every hedgerow and turn parks and commons into potato plots or it may be turnip fields . One may feel certain of all this and yet admire the author of The Earthly Paradise , “ the idle singer of an empty day ” when he preaches universal brotherhood in the crossways of Hammersmith , and wrestles with policemen , or wrangles with obtuse magistrates about the freedom of speech . Conviction thus upheld at the cost of worldly advantage and personal convenience and taste must command respect even from those who cannot share it .</p>

     <l n="5">Their eyes beheld the fair Trinacrian shore ,</l>
     <l n="6">And there-along they coasted two days more .</l>
     <l n="7">Then first Medea warned them to take heed ,</l>
     <l n="8">Lest they should end all memory of their deed</l>
     <l n="9">Where dwell the Sirens on the yellow sand ,</l>
     <l n="10">And folk should think some tangled poisonous land</l>
     <l n="11">Had buried them , or some tumultuous sea</l>
     <l n="12">O'er their white bones was tossing angrily ;</l>
     <l n="13">Or that some muddy river , far from Greece ,</l>
     <l n="14">Drove seaward o'er the ringlets of the Fleece .</l>
     <l n="15">But when the Minyae hearkened to this word ,</l>
     <l n="16">With many a thought their wearied hearts were stirred ,</l>
     <l n="17">And longing for the near-gained Grecian land ,</l>
     <l n="18">Where in a little while their feet should stand ;</l>
     <l n="19">Yet none the less like to a happy dream ,</l>
     <l n="20">Now , when they neared it , did their own home seem ,</l>
     <l n="21">And like a dream the glory of their quest ,</l>
     <l n="22">And therewithal some thought of present rest</l>
     <l n="23">Stole over them , and they were fain to sigh ,</l>
     <l n="24">Hearkening the sighing restless wind go by .</l>
     <l n="25">But hard on even of the second day ,</l>
     <l n="26">As o'er the gentle waves they took their way ,</l>
     <l n="27">The orange-scented land-breeze seemed to bear</l>
     <l n="28">Some other sounds unto the listening ear</l>
     <l n="29">Than all day long they had been hearkening ,</l>
     <l n="30">The land-born signs of many a well-known thing .</l>
     <l n="31">Thereat Medea trembled , for she knew</l>
     <l n="32">That nigh the dreadful sands at last they drew ,</l>
     <l n="33">For certainly the Sirens ’ song she heard ,</l>
     <l n="34">Though yet her ear could shape it to no word ,</l>
     <l n="35">And by their faces could the queen behold</l>
     <l n="36">How sweet it was , although no tale it told ,</l>
     <l n="37">To those worn toilers o'er the bitter sea .</l>
     <l n="38">Now , as they sped along , they presently ,</l>
     <l n="39">Rounding a headland , reached a little bay</l>
     <l n="40">Walled from the sea by splintered cliffs and grey ,</l>
     <l n="41">Capped by the thymy hills ’ green wind-beat head ,</l>
     <l n="42">Where ‘ mid the whin the burrowing rabbits fed .</l>
     <l n="43">And ‘ neath the cliff they saw a belt of sand ,</l>
     <l n="44">‘ Twixt Nereus ’ pasture and the high scarped land ,</l>
     <l n="45">Whereon , yet far off , could their eyes behold</l>
     <l n="46">White bodies moving , crowned and girt with gold ,</l>
     <l n="47">Wherefrom it seemed that lovely music welled .</l>
     <l n="48">So when all this the grey-eyed queen beheld ,</l>
     <l n="49">She said : “ O Jason , I have made thee wise</l>
     <l n="50">In this and other things ; turn then thine eyes</l>
     <l n="51">Seaward , and note the ripple of the sea ,</l>
     <l n="52">Where there is hope as well as fear for thee .</l>
     <l n="53">Nor look upon the death that lurketh there</l>
     <l n="54">‘ Neath the grey cliff , though sweet it seems and fair ;</l>
     <l n="55">For thou art young upon this day to die .</l>
     <l n="56">Take then the helm , and gazing steadily</l>
     <l n="57">Upon the road to Greece , make strong thine hand ,</l>
     <l n="58">And steer us toward the lion-haunted land ,</l>
     <l n="59">And thou , O Thracian ! if thou e'er hast moved</l>
     <l n="60">Men 's hearts with stories of the Gods who loved ,</l>
     <l n="61">And men who suffered , move them on this day ,</l>
     <l n="62">Taking the deadly love of death away ,</l>
     <l n="63">That even now is stealing over them ,</l>
     <l n="64">While still they gaze upon the ocean 's hem ,</l>
     <l n="65">Where their undoing is if they but knew . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="66">But while she spake , still nigher Argo drew</l>
     <l n="67">Unto the yellow edges of the shore ,</l>
     <l n="68">And little help she had of ashen oar ,</l>
     <l n="69">For as her shielded side rolled through the sea ,</l>
     <l n="70">Silent with glittering eyes the Minyae</l>
     <l n="71">Gazed o'er the surge , for they were nigh enow</l>
     <l n="72">To see the gusty wind of evening blow</l>
     <l n="73">Long locks of hair across those bodies white ,</l>
     <l n="74">With golden spray hiding some dear delight ;</l>
     <l n="75">Yea , nigh enow to see their red lips smile ,</l>
     <l n="76">Wherefrom all song had ceased now for a while ,</l>
     <l n="77">As though they deemed the prey was in the net ,</l>
     <l n="78">And they no more had need a bait to set ,</l>
     <l n="79">But their own bodies , fair beyond man 's thought ,</l>
     <l n="80">Under the grey cliff , hidden not of aught</l>
     <l n="81">But of such mist of tears as in the eyes</l>
     <l n="82">Of those seafaring men might chance to rise .</l>
     <l n="83">A moment Jason gazed , then through the waist</l>
     <l n="84">Ran swiftly , and with trembling hands made haste</l>
     <l n="85">To trim the sail , then to the tiller ran ,</l>
     <l n="86">And thrust aside the skilled Milesian man ,</l>
     <l n="87">Who with half-open mouth , and dreamy eyes ,</l>
     <l n="88">Stood steering Argo to that land of lies ;</l>
     <l n="89">But as he staggered forward , Jason 's hand</l>
     <l n="90">Hard on the tiller steered away from land ,</l>
     <l n="91">And as her head a little now fell off</l>
     <l n="92">Unto the wide sea , did he shout this scoff</l>
     <l n="93">To Thracian Orpheus : “ Minstrel , shall we die ,</l>
     <l n="94">Because thou hast forgotten utterly</l>
     <l n="95">What things she taught thee whom men call divine ?</l>
     <l n="96">Or will thy measures but lead folk to wine ,</l>
     <l n="97">And scented beds , and not to noble deeds ?</l>
     <l n="98">Or will they fail as fail the shepherd 's reeds</l>
     <l n="99">Before the trumpet , when these sea-witches</l>
     <l n="100">Pipe shrilly to the washing of the seas ?</l>
     <l n="101">I am a man , and these but beasts , but thou</l>
     <l n="102">Giving these souls , that all were men ere now ,</l>
     <l n="103">Shalt be a very God and not a man ! ”</l>
     <l n="104">So spake he ; but his fingers Orpheus ran</l>
     <l n="105">Over the strings , and sighing turned away</l>
     <l n="106">From that fair ending of the sunny bay ;</l>
     <l n="107">But as his well-skilled hands were preluding</l>
     <l n="108">What his heart swelled with , they began to sing</l>
     <l n="109">With pleading voices from the yellow sands ,</l>
     <l n="110">Clustered together , with appealing hands</l>
     <l n="111">Reached out to Argo as the great sail drew ,</l>
     <l n="112">While o'er their white limbs sharp the spray-shower flew ,</l>
     <l n="113">Since they spared not to set white feet among</l>
     <l n="114">The cold waves heedless of their honied song .</l>
     <l n="115">Sweetly they sang , and still the answer came</l>
     <l n="116">Piercing and clear from him , as bursts the flame</l>
     <l n="117">From out the furnace in the moonless night ;</l>
     <l n="118">Yet , as their words are no more known aright</l>
     <l n="119">Through lapse of many ages , and no man</l>
     <l n="120">Can any more across the waters wan</l>
     <l n="121">Behold those singing women of the sea ,</l>
     <l n="122">Once more I pray you all to pardon me ,</l>
     <l n="123">If with my feeble voice and harsh I sing</l>
     <l n="124">From what dim memories yet may chance to cling</l>
     <l n="125">About men 's hearts , of lovely things once sung</l>
     <l n="126">Beside the sea , while yet the world was young .</l>

     <l n="8">Back to the oars the Minyae , one by one ,</l>

     <l n="16">The sea grew white , and she began to glide</l>

     <l n="33">The wind sung o'er the empty beach and bare ,</l>
     <l n="34">And by the cliff uprose into the air</l>
     <l n="35">A delicate and glittering little cloud ,</l>
     <l n="36">That seemed some many-coloured sun to shroud ;</l>
     <l n="37">But as the rugged cliff it drew above</l>
     <l n="38">The wondering Minyae beheld it move</l>

     <l n="52">And snatched him thence to be awhile her love ,</l>
     <l n="53">Betwixt the golden pillars of her shrine ,</l>

     <l n="59">In life all empty of that promised bliss ,</l>
     <l n="60">In love that scarce can give a dying kiss ,</l>
     <l n="61">In pleasure ending sweet songs with a wail ,</l>
     <l n="62">In fame that little can dead men avail ,</l>
     <l n="63">In vain toil struggling with the fateful stream ,</l>
     <l n="64">In hope , the promise of a morning dream .</l>
     <l n="65">Yet as night died , and the cold sea and grey</l>
     <l n="66">Seemed running with them toward the dawn of day ,</l>
     <l n="67">Needs must they once again forget their death ,</l>
     <l n="68">Needs must they , being alive and drawing breath ,</l>
     <l n="69">As men who of no other life can know</l>

     <l n="73">But on the third day made another land</l>
     <l n="74">At dawn of day , and thitherward did stand ;</l>
     <l n="75">And since the wind blew lightly from the shore ,</l>
     <l n="76">Somewhat abeam , they feared not with the oar</l>
     <l n="77">To push across the shallowing sea and green ,</l>
     <l n="78">That washed a land the fairest they had seen ,</l>
     <l n="79">Whose shell-strewn beach at highest of the tide</l>
     <l n="80">‘ Twixt sea and flowery shore was nowise wide ,</l>
     <l n="81">And drawn a little backward from the sea</l>
     <l n="82">There stood a marble wall wrought cunningly ,</l>
     <l n="83">Rosy and white , set thick with images ,</l>
     <l n="84">And over-topped with heavy-fruited trees ,</l>
     <l n="85">Which by the shore ran , as the bay did bend ,</l>
     <l n="86">And to their eyes had neither gap nor end ;</l>
     <l n="87">Nor any gate : and looking over this ,</l>
     <l n="88">They saw a place not made for earthly bliss ,</l>
     <l n="89">Or eyes of dying men , for growing there</l>
     <l n="90">The yellow apple and the painted pear ,</l>
     <l n="91">And well-filled golden cups of oranges</l>
     <l n="92">Hung amid groves of pointed cypress trees ;</l>
     <l n="93">On grassy slopes the twining vine-boughs grew ,</l>
     <l n="94">And hoary olives ‘ twixt far mountains blue ,</l>
     <l n="95">And many-coloured flowers , like as a cloud</l>
     <l n="96">The rugged southern cliffs did softly shroud ;</l>
     <l n="97">And many a green-necked bird sung to his mate</l>
     <l n="98">Within the slim-leaved , thorny pomegranate ,</l>
     <l n="99">That flung its unstrung rubies on the grass ,</l>
     <l n="100">And slowly o'er the place the wind did pass</l>
     <l n="101">Heavy with many odours that it bore</l>
     <l n="102">From thymy hills down to the sea-beat shore ,</l>
     <l n="103">Because no flower there is , that all the year ,</l>
     <l n="104">From spring to autumn , beareth otherwhere ,</l>
     <l n="105">But there it flourished ; nor the fruit alone</l>
     <l n="106">From ‘ twixt the green leaves and the boughs outshone ,</l>
     <l n="107">For there each tree was ever flowering .</l>
     <l n="108">Nor was there lacking many a living thing</l>
     <l n="109">Changed of its nature ; for the roebuck there</l>
     <l n="110">Walked fearless with the tiger ; and the bear</l>
     <l n="111">Rolled sleepily upon the fruit-strawn grass ,</l>
     <l n="112">Letting the conies o'er his rough hide pass ,</l>
     <l n="113">With blinking eyes , that meant no treachery .</l>
     <l n="114">Careless the partridge passed the red fox by ;</l>
     <l n="115">Untouched the serpent left the thrushes brown ,</l>
     <l n="116">And as a picture was the lion 's frown .</l>
     <l n="117">But in the midst there was a grassy space ,</l>
     <l n="118">Raised somewhat over all the flowery place ,</l>
     <l n="119">On marble terrace-walls wrought like a dream ;</l>
     <l n="120">And round about it ran a clear blue stream ,</l>
     <l n="121">Bridged o'er with marble steps , and midmost there</l>
     <l n="122">Grew a green tree , whose smooth grey boughs did bear</l>
     <l n="123">Such fruit as never man elsewhere had seen ,</l>
     <l n="124">For ‘ twixt the sunlight and the shadow green</l>
     <l n="125">Shone out fair apples of red gleaming gold .</l>
     <l n="126">Moreover round the tree , in many a fold ,</l>
     <l n="127">Lay coiled a dragon , glittering little less</l>
     <l n="128">Than that which his eternal watchfulness</l>
     <l n="129">Was set to guard ; nor yet was he alone ,</l>
     <l n="130">For from the daisied grass about him shone</l>
     <l n="131">Gold raiment wrapping round two damsels fair ,</l>
     <l n="132">And one upon the steps combed out her hair ,</l>
     <l n="133">And with shut eyes sung low as in a dream ;</l>
     <l n="134">And one stood naked in the cold blue stream ,</l>
     <l n="135">While on the bank her golden raiment lay ;</l>
     <l n="136">But on that noontide of the quivering day ,</l>
     <l n="137">She only , hearing the seafarers ’ shout ,</l>
     <l n="138">Her lovely golden head had turned about ,</l>
     <l n="139">And seen their white sail flapping o'er the wall ,</l>
     <l n="140">And as she turned had let her tresses fall ,</l>
     <l n="141">Which the thin water rippling round her knee</l>
     <l n="142">Bore outward from her toward the restless sea .</l>
     <l n="143">Not long she stood , but looking seaward yet ,</l>
     <l n="144">From out the water made good haste to get ,</l>
     <l n="145">And catching up her raiment hastily ,</l>
     <l n="146">Ran up the marble stair , and ‘ gan to cry :</l>

     <l n="269">Of brazen pillars and fair-gilded vanes ,</l>
     <l n="270">And , dropping down by dank dark-wooded lanes</l>
     <l n="271">From off the hill-side , reached a house at last</l>

     <l n="277">Where folk already sat beside the board ,</l>
     <l n="278">And on the dais was an ancient lord .</l>
     <l n="279">But when these saw the fearless Minyae</l>
     <l n="280">Glittering in arms , they sprang up hastily ,</l>
     <l n="281">And each man turned about unto the wall</l>
     <l n="282">To seize his spear or staff : then through the hall</l>
     <l n="283">Jason cried out : “ Laconians , fear ye not ,</l>
     <l n="284">Nor leave the flesh-meat while it reeketh hot</l>
     <l n="285">For dread of us , for we are men as ye ,</l>

     <l n="297">Ye now are come . ”</l>
     <l n="298">Therewith the great hall rang</l>
     <l n="299">With joyful shouts , and as , with clash and clang</l>
     <l n="300">Of well-wrought arms , up to the dais they went ,</l>
     <l n="301">All eyes upon the Minyae were bent ,</l>
     <l n="302">Nor could they have enough of wondering</l>
     <l n="303">At this or that sea-tossed victorious king .</l>
     <l n="304">So with the strangers there they held high feast ,</l>
     <l n="305">And afterwards the slaves drove many a beast</l>
     <l n="306">Down to the shore , and carried back again</l>
     <l n="307">Great store of precious things in pack and wain ;</l>
     <l n="308">Wrought gold and silver , gems , full many a bale</l>
     <l n="309">Of scarlet cloth , and fine silk , fit to veil</l>
     <l n="310">The perfect limbs of dreaded Goddesses ;</l>
     <l n="311">Spices fresh-gathered from the outland trees ,</l>
     <l n="312">And arms well-wrought , and precious scarce-known wine ,</l>
     <l n="313">And carven images well-nigh divine .</l>
     <l n="314">So when all folk with these were satisfied ,</l>
     <l n="315">Back went the Minyae to the water-side ,</l>
     <l n="316">And with them that old lord , fain to behold</l>
     <l n="317">Victorious Argo and the Fleece of Gold .</l>
     <l n="318">And so aboard amid the oars he lay</l>
     <l n="319">Throughout the night , and at the dawn of day</l>
     <l n="320">Did all men land , nor spared that day to wear</l>
     <l n="321">The best of all they had of gold-wrought gear ,</l>
     <l n="322">And every one , being crowned with olive grey ,</l>
     <l n="323">Up to the headland did they take their way ,</l>
     <l n="324">Where now already stood the crowned priests</l>
     <l n="325">About the altars by the gilt-horned beasts .</l>
     <l n="326">There , as the fair sun rose , did Jason break</l>
     <l n="327">Over the altar the thin barley-cake ,</l>
     <l n="328">And cast the salt abroad , and there were slain</l>
     <l n="329">The milk-white bulls , and there red wine did rain</l>
     <l n="330">On to the fire from out the ancient jar ,</l>
     <l n="331">And high rose up the red flame , seen afar</l>
     <l n="332">From many another headland of that shore :</l>
     <l n="333">But over all its crackling and its roar</l>
     <l n="334">Uprose from time to time a joyous song ,</l>
     <l n="335">That on the summer morning lay for long ,</l>
     <l n="336">The mighty voices of the Minyae</l>
     <l n="337">Exulting o'er the tossing conquered sea ,</l>
     <l n="338">That far below thrust on by tide and wind</l>
     <l n="339">The crumbling bases of the headland mined .</l>

     <l n="19">Thronged with much people clad in ancient guise</l>
     <l n="20">I now am fain to set before your eyes ;</l>

     <l n="28">While in their vessels gleams the morning sun .</l>
     <l n="29">On one side of the square a temple stands ,</l>
     <l n="30">Wherein the gods worshipped in ancient lands</l>
     <l n="31">Still have their altars , a great market-place</l>
     <l n="32">Upon two other sides fills all the space ,</l>
     <l n="33">And thence the busy hum of men comes forth ;</l>
     <l n="34">But on the cold side looking toward the north</l>
     <l n="35">A pillared council-house may you behold ,</l>
     <l n="36">Within whose porch are images of gold ,</l>
     <l n="37">Gods of the nations who dwelt anciently</l>

     <l n="45">To shut it after you — but now behold</l>
     <l n="46">The city rulers on their thrones of gold ,</l>
     <l n="47">Clad in most fair attire , and in their hands</l>
     <l n="48">Long carven silver-banded ebony wands ;</l>

     <l n="63">Until , their wonder gathering to a head ,</l>
     <l n="64">The wisest man , who long that land has led ,</l>
     <l n="65">Breaks the deep silence , unto whom again</l>
     <l n="66">A wanderer answers . Slowly as in pain ,</l>
     <l n="67">And with a hollow voice as from a tomb</l>
     <l n="68">At first he tells the story of his doom ,</l>
     <l n="69">But as it grows and once more hopes and fears ,</l>
     <l n="70">Both measureless , are ringing round his ears ,</l>
     <l n="71">His eyes grow bright , his seeming days decrease ,</l>
     <l n="72">For grief once told brings somewhat back of peace .</l>

     <l n="14">Across the perils of the shifting plain</l>
     <l n="15">To seek your own land whereso that may be :</l>

     <l n="18">To reach it , unto none of whom was given</l>
     <l n="19">To come again and tell us of the tale ,</l>

     <l n="88">It was a bright September afternoon ,</l>

     <l n="118">But little riches as I needs must deem . ”</l>

     <l n="127">Dead at the end of many miseries ,</l>
     <l n="128">And little Kirstin , as thou well mayst know ,</l>
     <l n="129">Would be content throughout the world to go</l>
     <l n="130">If I but took her hand , and now still more</l>

     <l n="154">Be wise ; I bid you for a while farewell ,</l>
     <l n="155">Leave ye this stronghold when St. Peter 's bell</l>
     <l n="156">Strikes midnight , all will surely then be still ,</l>
     <l n="157">And I will bide you at King Tryggve 's hill</l>
     <l n="158">Outside the city gates . ”</l>
     <l n="159">Each went his way</l>
     <l n="160">Therewith , and I the remnant of that day</l>
     <l n="161">Gained for the quest three men that I deemed true ,</l>
     <l n="162">And did such other things as I must do ,</l>
     <l n="163">And still was ever listening for the chime</l>
     <l n="164">Half maddened by the lazy lapse of time ,</l>
     <l n="165">Yea , scarce I thought indeed that I should live</l>
     <l n="166">Till the great tower the joyful sound should give</l>
     <l n="167">That set us free : and so the hours went past ,</l>
     <l n="168">Till startled by the echoing clang at last</l>
     <l n="169">That told of midnight , armed from head to heel</l>
     <l n="170">Down to the open postern did I steal ,</l>
     <l n="171">Bearing small wealth — this sword that yet hangs here</l>
     <l n="172">Worn thin and narrow with so many a year ,</l>
     <l n="173">My father 's axe that from Byzantium ,</l>
     <l n="174">With some few gems my pouch yet held , had come ,</l>
     <l n="175">Nought else that shone with silver or with gold .</l>
     <l n="176">But by the postern gate could I behold</l>
     <l n="177">Laurence the priest all armed as if for war ,</l>
     <l n="178">From off the town-wall , having some small store</l>
     <l n="179">Of arms and furs and raiment : then once more</l>
     <l n="180">I turned , and saw the autumn moonlight fall</l>
     <l n="181">Upon the new-built bastions of the wall ,</l>
     <l n="182">Strange with black shadow and grey flood of light ,</l>
     <l n="183">And further off I saw the lead shine bright</l>
     <l n="184">On tower and turret-roof against the sky ,</l>
     <l n="185">And looking down I saw the old town lie</l>
     <l n="186">Black in the shade of the o'erhYpppHeNhanging hill ,</l>
     <l n="187">Stricken with death , and dreary , but all still</l>
     <l n="188">Until it reached the water of the bay ,</l>
     <l n="189">That in the dead night smote against the quay</l>
     <l n="190">Not all unheard , though there was little wind .</l>
     <l n="191">But as I turned to leave the place behind ,</l>
     <l n="192">The wind 's light sound , the slowly falling swell ,</l>
     <l n="193">Were hushed at once by that shrill-tinkling bell ,</l>
     <l n="194">That in that stillness jarring on mine ears ,</l>
     <l n="195">With sudden jangle checked the rising tears ,</l>
     <l n="196">And now the freshness of the open sea</l>
     <l n="197">Seemed ease and joy and very life to me .</l>
     <l n="198">So greeting my new mates with little sound ,</l>
     <l n="199">We made good haste to reach King Tryggve 's mound ,</l>
     <l n="200">And there the Breton Nicholas beheld ,</l>
     <l n="201">Who by the hand fair Kirstin Erling held ,</l>
     <l n="202">And round about them twenty men there stood ,</l>
     <l n="203">Of whom the more part on the holy rood</l>
     <l n="204">Were sworn till death to follow up the quest ,</l>
     <l n="205">And Kirstin was the mistress of the rest .</l>
     <l n="206">Again betwixt us was there little speech ,</l>
     <l n="207">But swiftly did we set on toward the beach ,</l>
     <l n="208">And coming there our keel , the Fighting Man ,</l>
     <l n="209">We boarded , and the long oars out we ran ,</l>
     <l n="210">And swept from out the firth , and sped so well</l>
     <l n="211">That scarcely could we hear St. Peter 's bell</l>
     <l n="212">Toll one , although the light wind blew from land ;</l>
     <l n="213">Then hoisting sail southward we ‘ gan to stand ,</l>
     <l n="214">And much I joyed beneath the moon to see</l>
     <l n="215">The lessening land that might have been to me</l>
     <l n="216">A kindly giver of wife , child , and friend ,</l>
     <l n="217">And happy life , or at the worser end</l>

    <head>OGIER THE DANE .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>When Ogier was born , six fay ladies came to the cradle where he lay , and gave him various gifts , as to be brave and happy and the like ; but the sixth gave him to be her love when he should have lived long in the world : so Ogier grew up and became the greatest of knights , and at last , after many years , fell into the hands of that fay , and with her , as the story tells , he lives now , though he returned once to the world , as is shown in the process of this tale .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Within some Danish city by the sea ,</l>
     <l n="2">Whose name , changed now , is all unknown to me ,</l>
     <l n="3">Great mourning was there one fair summer eve ,</l>
     <l n="4">Because the angels , bidden to receive</l>
     <l n="5">The fair Queen 's lovely soul in Paradise ,</l>
     <l n="6">Had done their bidding , and in royal guise</l>
     <l n="7">Her helpless body , once the prize of love ,</l>
     <l n="8">Unable now for fear or hope to move ,</l>
     <l n="9">Lay underneath the golden canopy ;</l>
     <l n="10">And bowed down by unkingly misery</l>
     <l n="11">The King sat by it , and not far away ,</l>
     <l n="12">Within the chamber a fair man-child lay ,</l>
     <l n="13">His mother 's bane , the king that was to be ,</l>
     <l n="14">Not witting yet of any royalty ,</l>
     <l n="15">Harmless and loved , although so new to life .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="16">Calm the June evening was , no sign of strife</l>
     <l n="17">The clear sky showed , no storm grew round the sun ,</l>
     <l n="18">Unhappy that his day of bliss was done ;</l>
     <l n="19">Dumb was the sea , and if the beech-wood stirred ,</l>
     <l n="20">‘ Twas with the nestling of the grey-winged bird</l>
     <l n="21">Midst its thick leaves ; and though the nightingale</l>
     <l n="22">Her ancient , hapless sorrow must bewail ,</l>
     <l n="23">No more of woe there seemed in her song</l>
     <l n="24">Than such as doth to lovers ’ words belong ,</l>
     <l n="25">Because their love is still unsatisfied .</l>
     <l n="26">But to the King , on that sweet eventide ,</l>
     <l n="27">No earth there seemed , no heaven when earth was gone ;</l>
     <l n="28">No help , no God ! but lonely pain alone ;</l>
     <l n="29">And he , midst unreal shadows , seemed to sit</l>
     <l n="30">Himself the very heart and soul of it .</l>
     <l n="31">But round the cradle of the new-born child</l>
     <l n="32">The nurses now the weary time beguiled</l>
     <l n="33">With stories of the just departed Queen ;</l>
     <l n="34">And how , amid the heathen folk first seen ,</l>
     <l n="35">She had been won to love and godliness ;</l>
     <l n="36">And as they spoke , e'en midst his dull distress ,</l>
     <l n="37">An eager whisper now and then would smite</l>
     <l n="38">Upon the King 's ear , of some past delight ,</l>
     <l n="39">Some once familiar name , and he would raise</l>
     <l n="40">His weary head , and on the speaker gaze</l>
     <l n="41">Like one about to speak , but soon again</l>
     <l n="42">Would drop his head and be alone with pain ,</l>
     <l n="43">Nor think of these ; who , silent in their turn ,</l>

     <l n="46">Until beneath the high stars ’ glimmering light ,</l>
     <l n="47">The fresh earth lay in colourless repose .</l>
     <l n="48">So passed the night , and now and then one rose</l>

     <l n="51">Or through the softly-opened door there came</l>
     <l n="52">Some nurse new waked , who , whispering low the name</l>
     <l n="53">Of her whose turn was come , would take her place ;</l>
     <l n="54">Then toward the King would turn about her face</l>
     <l n="55">And to her fellows whisper of the day ,</l>

     <l n="57">So passed the night , the moon arose and grew ,</l>
     <l n="58">From off the sea a little west-wind blew ,</l>
     <l n="59">Rustling the garden-leaves like sudden rain ;</l>
     <l n="60">And ere the moon had ‘ gun to fall again</l>
     <l n="61">The wind grew cold , a change was in the sky ,</l>
     <l n="62">And in deep silence did the dawn draw nigh ;</l>
     <l n="63">Then from her place a nurse arose to light</l>
     <l n="64">Fresh hallowed lights , for , dying with the night ,</l>
     <l n="65">The tapers round about the dead Queen were ;</l>
     <l n="66">But the King raised his head and ‘ gan to stare</l>
     <l n="67">Upon her , as her sweeping gown did glide</l>
     <l n="68">About the floor , that in the stillness cried</l>
     <l n="69">Beneath her careful feet ; and now as she</l>
     <l n="70">Had lit the second candle carefully ,</l>
     <l n="71">And on its silver spike another one</l>
     <l n="72">Was setting , through her body did there run</l>
     <l n="73">A sudden tremor , and the hand was stayed</l>
     <l n="74">That on the dainty painted wax was laid ;</l>
     <l n="75">Her eyelids fell down and she seemed to sleep ,</l>
     <l n="76">And o'er the staring King began to creep</l>
     <l n="77">Sweet slumber too ; the bitter lines of woe</l>
     <l n="78">That drew his weary face did softer grow ,</l>
     <l n="79">His eyelids dropped , his arms fell to his side ;</l>
     <l n="80">And moveless in their places did abide</l>
     <l n="81">The nursing women , held by some strong spell ,</l>
     <l n="82">E'en as they were , and utter silence fell</l>
     <l n="83">Upon the mournful , glimmering chamber fair .</l>
     <l n="84">But now light footsteps coming up the stair ,</l>
     <l n="85">Smote on the deadly stillness , and the sound</l>
     <l n="86">Of silken dresses trailing o'er the ground ;</l>
     <l n="87">And heavenly odours through the chamber passed ,</l>
     <l n="88">Unlike the scents that rose and lily cast</l>
     <l n="89">Upon the freshness of the dying night ;</l>
     <l n="90">Then nigher drew the sound of footsteps light</l>
     <l n="91">Until the door swung open noiselessly —</l>
     <l n="92">A mass of sunlit flowers there seemed to be</l>
     <l n="93">Within the doorway , and but pale and wan</l>
     <l n="94">The flame showed now that serveth mortal man ,</l>
     <l n="95">As one by one six seeming ladies passed</l>
     <l n="96">Into the room , and o'er its sorrow cast</l>
     <l n="97">That thoughtless sense of joy bewildering ,</l>
     <l n="98">That kisses youthful hearts amidst of spring ;</l>
     <l n="99">Crowned were they , in such glorious raiment clad ,</l>
     <l n="100">As yet no merchant of the world has had</l>
     <l n="101">Within his coffers ; yet those crowns seemed fair</l>
     <l n="102">Only because they kissed their odorous hair ,</l>
     <l n="103">And all that flowery raiment was but blessed</l>
     <l n="104">By those fair bodies that its splendour pressed .</l>
     <l n="105">Now to the cradle from that glorious band ,</l>
     <l n="106">A woman passed , and laid a tender hand</l>
     <l n="107">Upon the babe , and gently drew aside</l>
     <l n="108">The swathings soft that did his body hide ;</l>
     <l n="109">And , seeing him so fair and great , she smiled ,</l>
     <l n="110">And stooped , and kissed him , saying , “ O noble child ,</l>
     <l n="111">Have thou a gift from Gloriande this day ;</l>
     <l n="112">For to the time when life shall pass away</l>
     <l n="113">From this dear heart , no fear of death or shame ,</l>
     <l n="114">No weariness of good shall foul thy name . ”</l>
     <l n="115">So saying , to her sisters she returned ;</l>
     <l n="116">And one came forth , upon whose brow there burned</l>
     <l n="117">A crown of rubies , and whose heaving breast</l>
     <l n="118">With happy rings a golden hauberk pressed ;</l>
     <l n="119">She took the babe , and somewhat frowning said ,</l>
     <l n="120">“ This gift I give , that till thy limbs are laid</l>
     <l n="121">At rest for ever , to thine honoured life</l>
     <l n="122">There never shall be lacking war and strife ,</l>
     <l n="123">That thou a long-enduring name mayst win ,</l>
     <l n="124">And by thy deeds , good pardon for thy sin . ”</l>
     <l n="125">With that another , who , unseen , meanwhile</l>
     <l n="126">Had drawn anigh , said with a joyous smile ,</l>
     <l n="127">“ And this forgotten gift to thee I give ,</l>
     <l n="128">That while amidst the turmoil thou dost live ,</l>
     <l n="129">Still shalt thou win the game , and unto thee</l>
     <l n="130">Defeat and shame but idle words shall be . ”</l>
     <l n="131">Then back they turned , and therewithal , the fourth</l>
     <l n="132">Said , “ Take this gift for what it may be worth</l>
     <l n="133">For that is mine to give ; lo , thou shalt be</l>
     <l n="134">Gentle of speech , and in all courtesy</l>
     <l n="135">The first of men : a little gift this is ,</l>
     <l n="136">After these promises of fame and bliss . ”</l>
     <l n="137">Then toward the babe the fifth fair woman went ;</l>
     <l n="138">Grey-eyed she was , and simple , with eyes bent</l>
     <l n="139">Down on the floor , parted her red lips were ,</l>
     <l n="140">And o'er her sweet face marvellously fair</l>
     <l n="141">Oft would the colour spread full suddenly ;</l>
     <l n="142">Clad in a dainty gown and thin was she ,</l>
     <l n="143">For some green summer of the fay-land dight ,</l>
     <l n="144">Tripping she went , and laid her fingers light</l>
     <l n="145">Upon the child , and said , “ O little one ,</l>
     <l n="146">As long as thou shalt look upon the sun</l>
     <l n="147">Shall women long for thee ; take heed to this</l>
     <l n="148">And give them what thou canst of love and bliss . ”</l>
     <l n="149">Then , blushing for her words , therefrom she past ,</l>
     <l n="150">And by the cradle stood the sixth and last ,</l>
     <l n="151">The fairest of them all ; awhile she gazed</l>
     <l n="152">Down on the child , and then her hand she raised ,</l>
     <l n="153">And made the one side of her bosom bare ;</l>
     <l n="154">“ Ogier , ” she said , “ if this be foul or fair</l>
     <l n="155">Thou know'st not now , but when thine earthly life</l>
     <l n="156">Is drunk out to the dregs , and war and strife</l>
     <l n="157">Have yielded thee whatever joy they may ,</l>
     <l n="158">Thine head upon this bosom shalt thou lay ;</l>
     <l n="159">And then , despite of knowledge or of God ,</l>
     <l n="160">Will we be glad upon the flowery sod</l>
     <l n="161">Within the happy country where I dwell :</l>

     <l n="163">She turned , and even as they came they passed</l>
     <l n="164">From out the place , and reached the gate at last</l>
     <l n="165">That oped before their feet , and speedily</l>
     <l n="166">They gained the edges of the murmuring sea ,</l>
     <l n="167">And as they stood in silence , gazing there</l>
     <l n="168">Out to the west , they vanished into air ,</l>

     <l n="339">Mingled its pipe about the loadstone caves ;</l>
     <l n="340">But when the twinkling stars were hid away ,</l>
     <l n="341">And a faint light and broad , like dawn of day ,</l>
     <l n="342">The moon upon that dreary country shed ,</l>
     <l n="343">Ogier awoke , and lifting up his head</l>
     <l n="344">And smiling , muttered , “ Nay , no more again ;</l>
     <l n="345">Rather some pleasure new , some other pain ,</l>
     <l n="346">Unthought of both , some other form of strife ; ”</l>
     <l n="347">For he had waked from dreams of his old life ,</l>
     <l n="348">And through St. Omer 's archer-guarded gate</l>
     <l n="349">Once more had seemed to pass , and saw the state</l>
     <l n="350">Of that triumphant king ; and still , though all</l>
     <l n="351">Seemed changed , and folk by other names did call</l>
     <l n="352">Faces he knew of old , yet none the less</l>
     <l n="353">He seemed the same , and , midst that mightiness ,</l>
     <l n="354">Felt his own power , and grew the more athirst</l>
     <l n="355">For coming glory , as of old , when first</l>
     <l n="356">He stood before the face of Charlemaine ,</l>
     <l n="357">A helpless hostage with all life to gain .</l>
     <l n="358">But now , awake , his worn face once more sank</l>
     <l n="359">Between his hands , and , murmuring not , he drank</l>
     <l n="360">The draught of death that must that thirst allay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="361">But while he sat and waited for the day</l>
     <l n="362">A sudden light across the bare rock streamed ,</l>
     <l n="363">Which at the first he noted not , but deemed</l>
     <l n="364">The moon her fleecy veil had broken through ;</l>
     <l n="365">But ruddier indeed this new light grew</l>
     <l n="366">Than were the moon 's grey beams , and , therewithal ,</l>
     <l n="367">Soft far-off music on his ears did fall ;</l>
     <l n="368">Yet moved he not , but murmured , “ This is death ,</l>
     <l n="369">An easy thing like this to yield my breath ,</l>
     <l n="370">Awake , yet dreaming , with no sounds of fear ,</l>
     <l n="371">No dreadful sights to tell me it is near ;</l>
     <l n="372">Yea , God , I thank Thee ! ” but with that last word</l>
     <l n="373">It seemed to him that he his own name heard</l>
     <l n="374">Whispered , as though the wind had borne it past ;</l>
     <l n="375">With that he gat unto his feet at last ,</l>
     <l n="376">But still awhile he stood , with sunken head ,</l>
     <l n="377">And in a low and trembling voice he said ,</l>
     <l n="378">“ Lord , I am ready , whither shall I go ?</l>
     <l n="379">I pray Thee unto me some token show . ”</l>
     <l n="380">And , as he said this , round about he turned ,</l>
     <l n="381">And in the east beheld a light that burned</l>
     <l n="382">As bright as day ; then , though his flesh might fear</l>
     <l n="383">The coming change that he believed so near ,</l>
     <l n="384">Yet did his soul rejoice , for now he thought</l>
     <l n="385">Unto the very heaven to be brought :</l>
     <l n="386">And though he felt alive , deemed it might be</l>
     <l n="387">That he in sleep had died full easily .</l>
     <l n="388">Then toward that light did he begin to go ,</l>
     <l n="389">And still those strains he heard , far off and low ,</l>
     <l n="390">That grew no louder ; still that bright light streamed</l>
     <l n="391">Over the rocks , yet nothing brighter seemed ,</l>
     <l n="392">But like the light of some unseen bright flame</l>
     <l n="393">Shone round about , until at last he came</l>
     <l n="394">Unto the dreary islet 's other shore ,</l>
     <l n="395">And then the minstrelsy he heard no more ,</l>
     <l n="396">And softer seemed the strange light unto him ;</l>
     <l n="397">But yet or ever it had grown quite dim ,</l>
     <l n="398">Beneath its waning light could he behold</l>
     <l n="399">A mighty palace set about with gold ,</l>
     <l n="400">Above green meads and groves of summer trees</l>
     <l n="401">Far-off across the welter of the seas ;</l>
     <l n="402">But , as he gazed , it faded from his sight ,</l>
     <l n="403">And the grey hidden moon 's diffused soft light ,</l>
     <l n="404">Which soothly was but darkness to him now ,</l>
     <l n="405">His sea-girt island prison did but show .</l>
     <l n="406">But o'er the sea he still gazed wistfully ,</l>
     <l n="407">And said , “ Alas ! and when will this go by</l>
     <l n="408">And leave my soul in peace ? must I still dream</l>
     <l n="409">Of life that once so dear a thing did seem ,</l>
     <l n="410">That , when I wake , death may the bitterer be ?</l>
     <l n="411">Here will I sit until he come to me ,</l>
     <l n="412">And hide mine eyes and think upon my sin ,</l>
     <l n="413">That so a little calm I yet may win</l>
     <l n="414">Before I stand within the awful place . ”</l>
     <l n="415">Then down he sat and covered up his face ,</l>
     <l n="416">Yet therewithal his trouble could not hide ,</l>
     <l n="417">Nor waiting thus for death could he abide ,</l>
     <l n="418">For , though he knew it not , the yearning pain</l>
     <l n="419">Of hope of life had touched his soul again —</l>
     <l n="420">If he could live awhile , if he could live !</l>
     <l n="421">The mighty being , who once was wont to give</l>
     <l n="422">The gift of life to many a trembling man ;</l>
     <l n="423">Who did his own will since his life began ;</l>
     <l n="424">Who feared not aught , but strong and great and free</l>
     <l n="425">Still cast aside the thought of what might be ;</l>
     <l n="426">Must all this then be lost , and with no will ,</l>
     <l n="427">Powerless and blind , must he some fate fulfil ,</l>
     <l n="428">Nor know what he is doing any more ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="429">Soon he arose and paced along the shore ,</l>
     <l n="430">And gazed out seaward for the blessed light ;</l>
     <l n="431">But nought he saw except the old sad sight ,</l>
     <l n="432">The ceaseless tumbling of the billows grey ,</l>
     <l n="433">The white upspringing of the spurts of spray</l>
     <l n="434">Amidst that mass of timbers , the rent bones</l>
     <l n="435">Of the sea-houses of the hapless ones</l>
     <l n="436">Once cast like him upon this deadly isle .</l>
     <l n="437">He stopped his pacing in a little while ,</l>
     <l n="438">And clenched his mighty hands , and set his teeth ,</l>
     <l n="439">And gazing at the ruin underneath ,</l>
     <l n="440">He swung from off the bare cliff 's jagged brow ,</l>
     <l n="441">And on some slippery ledge he wavered now ,</l>
     <l n="442">Without a hand-hold , and now stoutly clung</l>
     <l n="443">With hands alone , and o'er the welter hung ,</l>
     <l n="444">Not caring aught if thus his life should end ;</l>
     <l n="445">But safely midst all this did he descend</l>
     <l n="446">The dreadful cliff , and since no beach was there ,</l>
     <l n="447">But from the depths the rock rose stark and bare ,</l>
     <l n="448">Nor crumbled aught beneath the hammering sea ,</l>
     <l n="449">Upon the wrecks he stood unsteadily .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="450">But now , amid the clamour of the waves ,</l>
     <l n="451">And washing to-and-fro of beams and staves ,</l>
     <l n="452">Dizzy with hunger , dreamy with distress ,</l>
     <l n="453">And all those days of fear and loneliness ,</l>
     <l n="454">The ocean 's tumult seemed the battle 's roar ,</l>
     <l n="455">His heart grew hot , as when in days of yore</l>
     <l n="456">He heard the cymbals clash amid the crowd</l>
     <l n="457">Of dusky faces ; now he shouted loud ,</l>
     <l n="458">And from crushed beam to beam began to leap ,</l>
     <l n="459">And yet his footing somehow did he keep</l>
     <l n="460">Amidst their tossing , and indeed the sea</l>
     <l n="461">Was somewhat sunk upon the island 's lee .</l>
     <l n="462">So quickly on from wreck to wreck he passed ,</l>
     <l n="463">And reached the outer line of wrecks at last ,</l>
     <l n="464">And there a moment stood unsteadily ,</l>
     <l n="465">Amid the drift of spray that hurried by ,</l>
     <l n="466">And drew Courtain his sword from out its sheath ,</l>
     <l n="467">And poised himself to meet the coming death ,</l>
     <l n="468">Still looking out to sea ; but as he gazed ,</l>
     <l n="469">And once or twice his doubtful feet he raised</l>
     <l n="470">To take the final plunge , that heavenly strain</l>
     <l n="471">Over the washing waves he heard again ,</l>
     <l n="472">And from the dimness something bright he saw</l>
     <l n="473">Across the waste of waters towards him draw ;</l>
     <l n="474">And hidden now , now raised aloft , at last</l>
     <l n="475">Unto his very feet a boat was cast ,</l>
     <l n="476">Gilded inside and out , and well arrayed</l>
     <l n="477">With cushions soft ; far fitter to have weighed</l>
     <l n="478">From some sweet garden on the shallow Seine ,</l>
     <l n="479">Or in a reach of green Thames to have lain ,</l>
     <l n="480">Than struggle with that huge confused sea ;</l>
     <l n="481">But Ogier gazed upon it doubtfully</l>
     <l n="482">One moment , and then , sheathing Courtain , said ,</l>
     <l n="483">“ What tales are these about the newly dead</l>
     <l n="484">The heathen told ? what matter , let all pass ;</l>
     <l n="485">This moment as one dead indeed I was ,</l>
     <l n="486">And this must be what I have got to do ,</l>
     <l n="487">I yet perchance may light on something new</l>
     <l n="488">Before I die ; though yet perchance this keel</l>
     <l n="489">Unto the wondrous mass of charmed steel</l>
     <l n="490">Is drawn as others . ” With that word he leapt</l>
     <l n="491">Into the boat , and o'er the cushions crept</l>
     <l n="492">From stem to stern , but found no rudder there ,</l>
     <l n="493">Nor any oars , nor were the cushions fair</l>
     <l n="494">Made wet by any dashing of the sea .</l>
     <l n="495">Now while he pondered how these things could be ,</l>
     <l n="496">The boat began to move therefrom at last ,</l>
     <l n="497">But over him a drowsiness was cast ,</l>
     <l n="498">And as o'er tumbling hills the skiff did pass ,</l>
     <l n="499">He clean forgot his death and where he was .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="500">At last he woke up to a sunny day ,</l>
     <l n="501">And , looking round , saw that his shallop lay</l>
     <l n="502">Moored at the edge of some fair tideless sea</l>
     <l n="503">Unto an overhanging thick-leaved tree ,</l>
     <l n="504">Where in the green waves did the low bank dip</l>
     <l n="505">Its fresh and green grass-covered daisied lip ;</l>
     <l n="506">But Ogier looking thence no more could see</l>
     <l n="507">That sad abode of death and misery ,</l>
     <l n="508">Nor aught but wide and empty ocean , grey</l>
     <l n="509">With gathering haze , for now it neared midday ;</l>
     <l n="510">Then from the golden cushions did he rise ,</l>
     <l n="511">And wondering still if this were Paradise</l>
     <l n="512">He stepped ashore , but drew Courtain his sword</l>
     <l n="513">And muttered therewithal a holy word .</l>
     <l n="514">Fair was the place , as though amidst of May ,</l>
     <l n="515">Nor did the brown birds fear the sunny day ,</l>
     <l n="516">For with their quivering song the air was sweet ;</l>
     <l n="517">Thick grew the field-flowers underneath his feet ,</l>
     <l n="518">And on his head the blossoms down did rain ,</l>
     <l n="519">Yet mid these fair things slowly and with pain</l>
     <l n="520">He ‘ gan to go , yea , even when his foot</l>
     <l n="521">First touched the flowery sod , to his heart 's root</l>
     <l n="522">A coldness seemed to strike , and now each limb</l>
     <l n="523">Was growing stiff , his eyes waxed bleared and dim ,</l>
     <l n="524">And all his stored-up memory ‘ gan to fail ,</l>
     <l n="525">Nor yet would his once mighty heart avail</l>
     <l n="526">For lamentations o'er his changed lot ;</l>
     <l n="527">Yet urged by some desire , he knew not what ,</l>
     <l n="528">Along a little path ‘ twixt hedges sweet ,</l>
     <l n="529">Drawn sword in hand , he dragged his faltering feet ,</l>
     <l n="530">For what then seemed to him a weary way ,</l>
     <l n="531">Whereon his steps he needs must often stay</l>
     <l n="532">And lean upon the mighty well-worn sword</l>
     <l n="533">That in those hands , grown old , for king or lord</l>
     <l n="534">Had small respect in glorious days long past .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="535">But still he crept along , and at the last</l>
     <l n="536">Came to a gilded wicket , and through this</l>
     <l n="537">Entered a garden fit for utmost bliss ,</l>
     <l n="538">If that might last which needs must soon go by :</l>
     <l n="539">There ‘ gainst a tree he leaned , and with a sigh</l>
     <l n="540">He said , “ O God , a sinner I have been ,</l>
     <l n="541">And good it is that I these things have seen</l>
     <l n="542">Before I meet what Thou hast set apart</l>
     <l n="543">To cleanse the earthly folly from my heart ;</l>
     <l n="544">But who within this garden now can dwell</l>
     <l n="545">Wherein guilt first upon the world befell ? ”</l>
     <l n="546">A little further yet he staggered on ,</l>
     <l n="547">Till to a fountain-side at last he won ,</l>
     <l n="548">O'er which two white-thorns their sweet blossoms shed ,</l>
     <l n="549">There he sank down , and laid his weary head</l>
     <l n="550">Beside the mossy roots , and in a while</l>
     <l n="551">He slept , and dreamed himself within the isle ;</l>
     <l n="552">That splashing fount the weary sea did seem ,</l>
     <l n="553">And in his dream the fair place but a dream ;</l>
     <l n="554">But when again to feebleness he woke</l>
     <l n="555">Upon his ears that heavenly music broke ,</l>
     <l n="556">Not faint or far as in the isle it was ,</l>
     <l n="557">But e'en as though the minstrels now did pass</l>
     <l n="558">Anigh his resting-place ; then fallen in doubt ,</l>
     <l n="559">E'en as he might , he rose and gazed about ,</l>
     <l n="560">Leaning against the hawthorn stem with pain ;</l>
     <l n="561">And yet his straining gaze was but in vain ,</l>
     <l n="562">Death stole so fast upon him , and no more</l>
     <l n="563">Could he behold the blossoms as before ,</l>
     <l n="564">No more the trees seemed rooted to the ground ,</l>
     <l n="565">A heavy mist seemed gathering all around ,</l>
     <l n="566">And in its heart some bright thing seemed to be ,</l>
     <l n="567">And round his head there breathed deliciously</l>
     <l n="568">Sweet odours , and that music never ceased .</l>
     <l n="569">But as the weight of Death 's strong hand increased</l>
     <l n="570">Again he sank adown , and Courtain 's noise</l>
     <l n="571">Within the scabbard seemed a farewell voice</l>
     <l n="572">Sent from the world he loved so well of old ,</l>
     <l n="573">And all his life was as a story told ,</l>
     <l n="574">And as he thought thereof he ‘ gan to smile</l>
     <l n="575">E'en as a child asleep , but in a while</l>
     <l n="576">It was as though he slept , and sleeping dreamed ,</l>
     <l n="577">For in his half-closed eyes a glory gleamed ,</l>
     <l n="578">As though from some sweet face and golden hair ,</l>
     <l n="579">And on his breast were laid soft hands and fair ,</l>
     <l n="580">And a sweet voice was ringing in his ears ,</l>
     <l n="581">Broken as if with flow of joyous tears ;</l>
     <l n="582">“ Ogier , sweet friend , hast thou not tarried long ?</l>
     <l n="583">Alas ! thine hundred years of strife and wrong ! ”</l>
     <l n="584">Then he found voice to say , “ Alas ! dear Lord ,</l>
     <l n="585">Too long , too long ; and yet one little word</l>
     <l n="586">Right many a year agone had brought me here . ”</l>
     <l n="587">Then to his face that face was drawn anear ,</l>
     <l n="588">He felt his head raised up and gently laid</l>
     <l n="589">On some kind knee , again the sweet voice said ,</l>
     <l n="590">“ Nay , Ogier , nay , not yet , not yet , dear friend !</l>
     <l n="591">Who knoweth when our linked life shall end ,</l>
     <l n="592">Since thou art come unto mine arms at last ,</l>
     <l n="593">And all the turmoil of the world is past ?</l>
     <l n="594">Why do I linger ere I see thy face</l>
     <l n="595">As I desired it in that mourning place</l>
     <l n="596">So many years ago — so many years ,</l>
     <l n="597">Thou knewest not thy love and all her fears ? ”</l>
     <l n="598">“ Alas ! ” he said , “ what mockery is this</l>
     <l n="599">That thou wilt speak to me of earthly bliss ?</l>
     <l n="600">No longer can I think upon the earth ,</l>
     <l n="601">Have I not done with all its grief and mirth ?</l>
     <l n="602">Yes , I was Ogier once , but if my love</l>
     <l n="603">Should come once more my dying heart to move ,</l>
     <l n="604">Then must she come from ‘ neath the milk-white walls</l>
     <l n="605">Whereon to-day the hawthorn blossom falls</l>

     <l n="613">Did I forget thee in the days gone by ?</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="615">He tried to move from her , but all in vain ,</l>

     <l n="632">Thou livest still , my sweet , thou livest still ,</l>
     <l n="633">Apart from every earthly fear and ill ;</l>
     <l n="634">Wilt thou not love me , who have wrought thee this ,</l>
     <l n="635">That I like thee may live in double bliss ? ”</l>
     <l n="636">Then Ogier rose up , nowise like to one</l>
     <l n="637">Whose span of earthly life is nigh outrun ,</l>
     <l n="638">But as he might have risen in old days</l>
     <l n="639">To see the spears cleave the fresh morning haze ;</l>
     <l n="640">But , looking round , he saw no change there was</l>
     <l n="641">In the fair place wherethrough he first did pass ,</l>
     <l n="642">Though all , grown clear and joyous to his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="643">Now looked no worse than very Paradise ;</l>
     <l n="644">Behind him were the thorns , the fountain fair</l>
     <l n="645">Still sent its glittering stream forth into air ,</l>
     <l n="646">And by its basin a fair woman stood ,</l>
     <l n="647">And as their eyes met his renewed blood</l>
     <l n="648">Rushed to his face ; with unused thoughts and sweet</l>
     <l n="649">And hurrying hopes , his heart began to beat .</l>
     <l n="650">The fairest of all creatures did she seem ;</l>
     <l n="651">So fresh and delicate you well might deem</l>
     <l n="652">That scarce for eighteen summers had she blessed</l>
     <l n="653">The happy , longing world ; yet , for the rest ,</l>
     <l n="654">Within her glorious eyes such wisdom dwelt</l>
     <l n="655">A child before her had the wise man felt ,</l>
     <l n="656">And with the pleasure of a thousand years</l>
     <l n="657">Her lips were fashioned to move joy or tears</l>
     <l n="658">Among the longing folk where she might dwell ,</l>
     <l n="659">To give at last the kiss unspeakable .</l>
     <l n="660">In such wise was she clad as folk may be ,</l>
     <l n="661">Who , for no shame of their humanity ,</l>
     <l n="662">For no sad changes of the imperfect year ,</l>
     <l n="663">Rather for added beauty , raiment wear ;</l>
     <l n="664">For , as the heat-foretelling grey-blue haze</l>
     <l n="665">Veils the green flowery morn of late May-days ,</l>
     <l n="666">Her raiment veiled her ; where the bands did meet</l>
     <l n="667">That bound the sandals to her dainty feet ,</l>
     <l n="668">Gems gleamed ; a fresh rose-wreath embraced her head ,</l>
     <l n="669">And on her breast there lay a ruby red .</l>
     <l n="670">So with a supplicating look she turned</l>
     <l n="671">To meet the flame that in his own eyes burned ,</l>
     <l n="672">And held out both her white arms lovingly ,</l>
     <l n="673">As though to greet him as he drew anigh .</l>
     <l n="674">Stammering he said , “ Who art thou ? how am I</l>
     <l n="675">So cured of all my evils suddenly ,</l>
     <l n="676">That certainly I felt no mightier , when ,</l>
     <l n="677">Amid the backward rush of beaten men ,</l>
     <l n="678">About me drooped the axe-torn Oriflamme ?</l>
     <l n="679">Alas ! I fear that in some dream I am . ”</l>
     <l n="680">“ Ogier , ” she said , “ draw near , perchance it is</l>
     <l n="681">That such a name God gives unto our bliss ;</l>
     <l n="682">I know not , but if thou art such an one</l>
     <l n="683">As I must deem , all days beneath the sun</l>
     <l n="684">That thou hast had , shall be but dreams indeed</l>
     <l n="685">To those that I have given thee at thy need .</l>
     <l n="686">For many years ago beside the sea</l>
     <l n="687">When thou wert born , I plighted troth with thee :</l>
     <l n="688">Come near then , and make mirrors of mine eyes ,</l>
     <l n="689">That thou mayest see what these my mysteries</l>
     <l n="690">Have wrought in thee ; surely but thirty years ,</l>
     <l n="691">Passed amidst joy , thy new born body bears ,</l>
     <l n="692">Nor while thou art with me , and on this shore</l>
     <l n="693">Art still full-fed of love , shalt thou seem more .</l>
     <l n="694">Nay , love , come nigher , and let me take thine hand ,</l>
     <l n="695">The hope and fear of many a warring land ,</l>
     <l n="696">And I will show thee wherein lies the spell ,</l>
     <l n="697">Whereby this happy change upon thee fell . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="698">Like a shy youth before some royal love ,</l>
     <l n="699">Close up to that fair woman did he move ,</l>
     <l n="700">And their hands met ; yet to his changed voice</l>
     <l n="701">He dared not trust ; nay , scarcely could rejoice</l>
     <l n="702">E'en when her balmy breath he ‘ gan to feel ,</l>
     <l n="703">And felt strange sweetness o'er his spirit steal</l>
     <l n="704">As her light raiment , driven by the wind ,</l>
     <l n="705">Swept round him , and , bewildered and half-blind ,</l>
     <l n="706">His lips the treasure of her lips did press ,</l>
     <l n="707">And round him clung her perfect loveliness .</l>
     <l n="708">For one sweet moment thus they stood , and then</l>
     <l n="709">She drew herself from out his arms again ,</l>
     <l n="710">And panting , lovelier for her love , did stand</l>
     <l n="711">Apart awhile , then took her lover 's hand ,</l>
     <l n="712">And , in a trembling voice , made haste to say ,—</l>

     <l n="715">I might have seen thee e'en one day too late ,</l>
     <l n="716">Before this ring thy finger should embrace ;</l>
     <l n="717">Behold it , love , and thy keen eyes may trace</l>
     <l n="718">Faint figures wrought upon the ruddy gold ;</l>
     <l n="719">My father dying gave it me , nor told</l>
     <l n="720">The manner of its making , but I know</l>
     <l n="721">That it can make thee e'en as thou art now</l>
     <l n="722">Despite the laws of God — shrink not from me</l>
     <l n="723">Because I give an impious gift to thee —</l>

     <l n="725">But I , who longed to share with thee my bliss ,</l>
     <l n="726">Am of the fays , and live their changeless life ,</l>
     <l n="727">And , like the gods of old , I see the strife</l>
     <l n="728">That moves the world , unmoved if so I will ;</l>
     <l n="729">For we the fruit , that teaches good and ill ,</l>
     <l n="730">Have never touched like you of Adam 's race ;</l>

     <l n="735">How thou art come into a happy land ?—</l>
     <l n="736">Love , in thy world the priests of heaven still sing ,</l>
     <l n="737">And tell thee of it many a joyous thing ;</l>
     <l n="738">But think'st thou , bearing the world 's joy and pain ,</l>
     <l n="739">Thou couldst live there ? nay , nay , but born again</l>

     <l n="744">“ But for the love and country thou hast won ,</l>

     <l n="750">Ah , what was this ? and was it all in vain ,</l>
     <l n="751">That she had brought him here this life to gain ?</l>
     <l n="752">For , ere her speech was done , like one turned blind</l>
     <l n="753">He watched the kisses of the wandering wind</l>
     <l n="754">Within her raiment , or as some one sees</l>
     <l n="755">The very best of well-wrought images</l>
     <l n="756">When he is blind with grief , did he behold</l>
     <l n="757">The wandering tresses of her locks of gold</l>
     <l n="758">Upon her shoulders ; and no more he pressed</l>
     <l n="759">The hand that in his own hand lay at rest :</l>
     <l n="760">His eyes , grown dull with changing memories ,</l>
     <l n="761">Could make no answer to her glorious eyes :</l>
     <l n="762">Cold waxed his heart , and weary and distraught ,</l>
     <l n="763">With many a cast-by , hateful , dreary thought ,</l>
     <l n="764">Unfinished in the old days ; and withal</l>
     <l n="765">He needs must think of what might chance to fall</l>
     <l n="766">In this life new-begun ; and good and bad</l>
     <l n="767">Tormented him , because as yet he had</l>
     <l n="768">A worldly heart within his frame made new ,</l>
     <l n="769">And to the deeds that he was wont to do</l>
     <l n="770">Did his desires still turn . But she a while</l>
     <l n="771">Stood gazing at him with a doubtful smile ,</l>
     <l n="772">And let his hand fall down ; but suddenly</l>
     <l n="773">Sounded sweet music from some close nearby ,</l>
     <l n="774">And then she spoke again : “ Come , love , with me ,</l>
     <l n="775">That thou thy new life and delights mayst see . ”</l>
     <l n="776">And gently with that word she led him thence ,</l>
     <l n="777">And though upon him now there fell a sense</l>
     <l n="778">Of dreamy and unreal bewilderment ,</l>
     <l n="779">As hand in hand through that green place they went ,</l>
     <l n="780">Yet therewithal a strain of tender love</l>
     <l n="781">A little yet his restless heart did move .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="782">So through the whispering trees they came at last</l>
     <l n="783">To where a wondrous house a shadow cast</l>
     <l n="784">Across the flowers , and o'er the daisied grass</l>
     <l n="785">Before it , crowds of lovely folk did pass ,</l>
     <l n="786">Playing about in carelessness and mirth ,</l>
     <l n="787">Unshadowed by the doubtful deeds of earth ;</l>
     <l n="788">And from the midst a band of fair girls came ,</l>
     <l n="789">With flowers and music , greeting him by name ,</l>
     <l n="790">And praising him ; but ever like a dream</l>
     <l n="791">He could not break , did all to Ogier seem ,</l>
     <l n="792">And he his old world did the more desire ,</l>
     <l n="793">For in his heart still burned unquenched the fire ,</l>
     <l n="794">That through the world of old so bright did burn :</l>
     <l n="795">Yet was he fain that kindness to return ,</l>
     <l n="796">And from the depth of his full heart he sighed .</l>
     <l n="797">Then toward the house the lovely Queen did guide</l>
     <l n="798">His listless steps , and seemed to take no thought</l>
     <l n="799">Of knitted brow or wandering eyes distraught ,</l>
     <l n="800">But still with kind love lighting up her face</l>
     <l n="801">She led him through the door of that fair place ,</l>
     <l n="802">While round about them did the damsels press ;</l>
     <l n="803">And he was moved by all that loveliness</l>
     <l n="804">As one might be , who , lying half asleep</l>
     <l n="805">In the May morning , notes the light wind sweep</l>
     <l n="806">Over the tulip-beds : no more to him</l>
     <l n="807">Were gleaming eyes , red lips , and bodies slim ,</l>
     <l n="808">Amidst that dream , although the first surprise</l>
     <l n="809">Of hurried love wherewith the Queen 's sweet eyes</l>
     <l n="810">Had smitten him , still in his heart did stir .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="811">And so at last he came , led on by her</l>
     <l n="812">Into a hall wherein a fair throne was ,</l>
     <l n="813">And hand in hand thereto the twain did pass ;</l>
     <l n="814">And there she bade him sit , and when alone</l>
     <l n="815">He took his place upon the double throne ,</l>
     <l n="816">She cast herself before him on her knees ,</l>
     <l n="817">Embracing his , and greatly did increase</l>
     <l n="818">The shame and love that vexed his troubled heart :</l>
     <l n="819">But now a line of girls the crowd did part ,</l>
     <l n="820">Lovelier than all , and Ogier could behold</l>
     <l n="821">One in their midst who bore a crown of gold</l>
     <l n="822">Within her slender hands and delicate ;</l>
     <l n="823">She , drawing nigh , beside the throne did wait</l>
     <l n="824">Until the Queen arose and took the crown ,</l>
     <l n="825">Who then to Ogier 's lips did stoop adown</l>
     <l n="826">And kissed him , and said , “ Ogier , what were worth</l>
     <l n="827">Thy miserable days of strife on earth ,</l>
     <l n="828">That on their ashes still thine eyes are turned ? ”</l>
     <l n="829">Then , as she spoke these words , his changed heart burned</l>
     <l n="830">With sudden memories , and thereto had he</l>
     <l n="831">Made answer , but she raised up suddenly</l>
     <l n="832">The crown she held and set it on his head ,</l>
     <l n="833">“ Ogier , ” she cried , “ those troublous days are dead ;</l>
     <l n="834">Thou wert dead with them also , but for me ;</l>
     <l n="835">Turn unto her who wrought these things for thee ! ”</l>
     <l n="836">Then , as he felt her touch , a mighty wave</l>
     <l n="837">Of love swept o'er his soul , as though the grave</l>
     <l n="838">Did really hold his body ; from his seat</l>
     <l n="839">He rose to cast himself before her feet ;</l>
     <l n="840">But she clung round him , and in close embrace</l>
     <l n="841">The twain were locked amidst that thronging place .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="842">Thenceforth new life indeed has Ogier won ,</l>

     <l n="846">Living like him in sweet forgetfulness</l>
     <l n="847">Of all the troubles that did once oppress</l>
     <l n="848">Their vainly-struggling lives — ah , how can I</l>
     <l n="849">Tell of their joy as though I had been nigh ?</l>
     <l n="850">Suffice it that no fear of death they knew ,</l>
     <l n="851">That there no talk there was of false or true ,</l>
     <l n="852">Of right or wrong , for traitors came not there ;</l>
     <l n="853">That everything was bright and soft and fair ,</l>
     <l n="854">And yet they wearied not for any change ,</l>

     <l n="856">Love knew they , but its pain they never had ,</l>

     <l n="861">Nor knew they yearning love amidst the dearth</l>
     <l n="862">Of kind and loving hearts to spend it on ,</l>
     <l n="863">Nor dreamed or discontent when all was won ;</l>
     <l n="864">Nor need they struggle after wealth and fame ;</l>

     <l n="898">Rich past the wont of men in those sad times ;</l>
     <l n="899">His face was bronzed , as though by burning climes ,</l>

     <l n="901">Carved in the days before on earth Christ trod ;</l>

     <l n="904">A mighty man he was , and taller far</l>
     <l n="905">Than those who on that day must bear the war</l>
     <l n="906">The pagans waged : he by the warders stayed</l>
     <l n="907">Scarce looked on them , but straight their words obeyed</l>
     <l n="908">And showed his pass ; then , asked about his name</l>
     <l n="909">And from what city of the world he came ,</l>
     <l n="910">Said , that men called him now the Ancient Knight ,</l>
     <l n="911">That he was come midst the king 's men to fight</l>

     <l n="914">And answered no more to the questioning</l>
     <l n="915">Of frightened folk of this or that sad thing ;</l>

     <l n="917">And on the wondering guard a strange look cast ,</l>
     <l n="918">And said , “ St. Mary ! do such men as ye</l>

     <l n="922">Beside the Hammer-bearer years agone . ”</l>
     <l n="923">So said he , and as his fair armour shone</l>
     <l n="924">With beauty of a time long passed away ,</l>
     <l n="925">So with the music of another day</l>
     <l n="926">His deep voice thrilled the awe-struck , listening folk .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="927">Yet from the crowd a mocking voice outbroke ,</l>
     <l n="928">That cried , “ Be merry , masters , fear ye nought ,</l>
     <l n="929">Surely good succour to our side is brought ;</l>
     <l n="930">For here is Charlemaine come off his tomb</l>
     <l n="931">To save his faithful city from its doom . ”</l>
     <l n="932">“ Yea , ” said another , “ this is certain news ,</l>
     <l n="933">Surely ye know how all the carvers use</l>
     <l n="934">To carve the dead man 's image at the best ,</l>
     <l n="935">That guards the place where he may lie at rest ;</l>
     <l n="936">Wherefore this living image looks indeed ,</l>
     <l n="937">Spite of his ancient tongue and marvellous weed ,</l>
     <l n="938">To have but thirty summers . ”</l>
     <l n="939">At the name</l>
     <l n="940">Of Charlemaine , he turned to whence there came</l>
     <l n="941">The mocking voice , and somewhat knit his brow ,</l>
     <l n="942">And seemed as he would speak , but scarce knew how ;</l>
     <l n="943">So with a half-sigh soon sank back again</l>
     <l n="944">Into his dream , and shook his well-wrought rein ,</l>
     <l n="945">And silently went on upon his way .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="946">And this was Ogier : on what evil day</l>
     <l n="947">Has he then stumbled , that he needs must come ,</l>
     <l n="948">Midst war and ravage , to the ancient home</l>
     <l n="949">Of his desires ? did he grow weary then ,</l>
     <l n="950">And wish to strive once more with foolish men</l>
     <l n="951">For worthless things ? or is fair Avallon</l>
     <l n="952">Sunk in the sea , and all that glory gone ?</l>
     <l n="953">Nay , thus it happed — One day she came to him</l>
     <l n="954">And said , “ Ogier , thy name is waxen dim</l>
     <l n="955">Upon the world that thou rememberest not ;</l>
     <l n="956">The heathen men are thick on many a spot</l>
     <l n="957">Thine eyes have seen , and which I love therefore ;</l>
     <l n="958">And God will give His wonted help no more .</l>
     <l n="959">Wilt thou , then , help ? canst thou have any mind</l>
     <l n="960">To give thy banner once more to the wind ?</l>
     <l n="961">Since greater glory thou shalt win for this</l>
     <l n="962">Than erst thou gatheredst ere thou cam'st to bliss :</l>
     <l n="963">For men are dwindled both in heart and frame ,</l>
     <l n="964">Nor holds the fair land any such a name</l>
     <l n="965">As thine , when thou wert living midst thy peers :</l>
     <l n="966">The world is worser for these hundred years . ”</l>
     <l n="967">From his calm eyes there gleamed a little fire ,</l>
     <l n="968">And in his voice was something of desire ,</l>
     <l n="969">To see the land where he was used to be ,</l>
     <l n="970">As now he answered : “ Nay , choose thou for me ,</l>
     <l n="971">Thou art the wisest ; it is more than well</l>
     <l n="972">Within this peaceful place with thee to dwell :</l>
     <l n="973">Nor ill perchance in that old land to die ,</l>
     <l n="974">If , dying , I keep not the memory</l>
     <l n="975">Of this fair life of ours . ” “ Nay , nay , ” said she ,</l>
     <l n="976">“ As to thy dying , that shall never be ,</l>
     <l n="977">Whiles that thou keep'st my ring — and now , behold ,</l>
     <l n="978">I take from thee thy charmed crown of gold ,</l>
     <l n="979">And thou wilt be the Ogier that thou wast</l>
     <l n="980">Ere on the loadstone rock thy ship was cast :</l>
     <l n="981">Yet thou shalt have thy youthful body still ,</l>
     <l n="982">And I will guard thy life from every ill . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="983">So was it done , and Ogier , armed right well ,</l>
     <l n="984">Sleeping , was borne away by some strong spell ,</l>
     <l n="985">And set upon the Flemish coast ; and thence</l>
     <l n="986">Turned to St. Omer 's , with a doubtful sense</l>
     <l n="987">Of being in some wild dream , the while he knew</l>
     <l n="988">That great delight forgotten was his due ,</l>
     <l n="989">That all which there might hap was of small worth .</l>
     <l n="990">So on he went , and sometimes unto mirth</l>
     <l n="991">Did his attire move the country-folk ,</l>
     <l n="992">But oftener when strange speeches from him broke</l>
     <l n="993">Concerning men and things for long years dead ,</l>
     <l n="994">He filled the listeners with great awe and dread ;</l>
     <l n="995">For in such wild times as these people were</l>
     <l n="996">Are men soon moved to wonder and to fear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="997">Now through the streets of Paris did he ride ,</l>
     <l n="998">And at a certain hostel did abide</l>
     <l n="999">Throughout that night , and ere he went next day</l>
     <l n="1000">He saw a book that on a table lay ,</l>
     <l n="1001">And opening it ‘ gan read in lazy mood :</l>
     <l n="1002">But long before it in that place he stood ,</l>
     <l n="1003">Noting nought else ; for it did chronicle</l>
     <l n="1004">The deeds of men of old he knew right well ,</l>
     <l n="1005">When they were living in the flesh with him :</l>
     <l n="1006">Yea , his own deeds he saw , grown strange and dim</l>
     <l n="1007">Already , and true stories mixed with lies ,</l>
     <l n="1008">Until , with many thronging memories</l>
     <l n="1009">Of those old days , his heart was so oppressed ,</l>
     <l n="1010">He ‘ gan to wish that he might lie at rest ,</l>
     <l n="1011">Forgetting all things : for indeed by this</l>
     <l n="1012">Little remembrance had he of the bliss</l>
     <l n="1013">That wrapped his soul in peaceful Avallon .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="1014">But his changed life he needs must carry on ;</l>
     <l n="1015">For ye shall know the Queen was gathering men</l>
     <l n="1016">To send unto the good King , who as then</l>
     <l n="1017">In Rouen lay , beset by many a band</l>
     <l n="1018">Of those who carried terror through the land ,</l>
     <l n="1019">And still by messengers for help he prayed :</l>
     <l n="1020">Therefore a mighty muster was being made ,</l>
     <l n="1021">Of weak and strong , and brave and timorous ,</l>
     <l n="1022">Before the Queen anigh her royal house .</l>
     <l n="1023">So thither on this morn did Ogier turn ,</l>
     <l n="1024">Some certain news about the war to learn ;</l>
     <l n="1025">And when he came at last into the square ,</l>
     <l n="1026">And saw the ancient palace great and fair</l>
     <l n="1027">Rise up before him as in other days ,</l>
     <l n="1028">And in the merry morn the bright sun 's rays</l>
     <l n="1029">Glittering on gathering helms and moving spears ,</l>
     <l n="1030">He ‘ gan to feel as in the long-past years ,</l>
     <l n="1031">And his heart stirred within him . Now the Queen</l>
     <l n="1032">Came from within , right royally beseen ,</l>
     <l n="1033">And took her seat beneath a canopy ,</l>
     <l n="1034">With lords and captains of the war anigh ;</l>
     <l n="1035">And as she came a mighty shout arose ,</l>
     <l n="1036">And round about began the knights to close ,</l>
     <l n="1037">Their oath of fealty there to swear anew ,</l>
     <l n="1038">And learn what service they had got to do .</l>
     <l n="1039">But so it was , that some their shouts must stay</l>
     <l n="1040">To gaze at Ogier as he took his way</l>
     <l n="1041">Through the thronged place ; and quickly too he gat</l>
     <l n="1042">Unto the place whereas the Lady sat ,</l>
     <l n="1043">For men gave place unto him , fearing him :</l>
     <l n="1044">For not alone was he most huge of limb ,</l>
     <l n="1045">And dangerous , but something in his face ,</l>
     <l n="1046">As his calm eyes looked o'er the crowded place ,</l>
     <l n="1047">Struck men with awe ; and in the ancient days ,</l>
     <l n="1048">When men might hope alive on gods to gaze ,</l>
     <l n="1049">They would have thought , “ The gods yet love our town</l>
     <l n="1050">And from the heavens have sent a great one down . ”</l>
     <l n="1051">Withal unto the throne he came so near ,</l>
     <l n="1052">That he the Queen 's sweet measured voice could hear ;</l>
     <l n="1053">And swiftly now within him wrought the change</l>
     <l n="1054">That first he felt amid those faces strange ;</l>
     <l n="1055">And his heart burned to taste the hurrying life</l>
     <l n="1056">With such desires , such changing sweetness rife .</l>
     <l n="1057">And yet , indeed , how should he live alone ,</l>
     <l n="1058">Who in the old past days such friends had known ?</l>
     <l n="1059">Then he began to think of Caraheu ,</l>
     <l n="1060">Of Bellicent the fair , and once more knew</l>
     <l n="1061">The bitter pain of rent and ended love .</l>
     <l n="1062">But while with hope and vain regret he strove ,</l>
     <l n="1063">He found none ‘ twixt him and the Queen 's high seat ,</l>
     <l n="1064">And , stepping forth , he knelt before her feet</l>
     <l n="1065">And took her hand to swear , as was the way</l>
     <l n="1066">Of doing fealty in that ancient day ,</l>
     <l n="1067">And raised his eyes to hers ; as fair was she</l>
     <l n="1068">As any woman of the world might be</l>
     <l n="1069">Full-limbed and tall , dark haired , from her deep eyes ,</l>
     <l n="1070">The snare of fools , the ruin of the wise ,</l>
     <l n="1071">Love looked unchecked ; and now her dainty hand ,</l>
     <l n="1072">The well-knit holder of the golden wand ,</l>
     <l n="1073">Trembled in his , she cast her eyes adown ,</l>
     <l n="1074">And her sweet brow was knitted to a frown ,</l>
     <l n="1075">As he , the taker of such oaths of yore ,</l>
     <l n="1076">Now unto her all due obedience swore ,</l>
     <l n="1077">Yet gave himself no name ; and now the Queen ,</l>
     <l n="1078">Awed by his voice as other folk had been ,</l>
     <l n="1079">Yet felt a trembling hope within her rise</l>
     <l n="1080">Too sweet to think of , and with love 's surprise</l>
     <l n="1081">Her cheek grew pale ; she said , “ Thy style and name</l>
     <l n="1082">Thou tellest not , nor what land of thy fame</l>
     <l n="1083">Is glad ; for , certes , some land must be glad ,</l>
     <l n="1084">That in its bounds her house thy mother had . ”</l>
     <l n="1085">“ Lady , ” he said , “ from what far land I come</l>
     <l n="1086">I well might tell thee , but another home</l>
     <l n="1087">Have I long dwelt in , and its name have I</l>
     <l n="1088">Forgotten now , forgotten utterly</l>
     <l n="1089">Who were my fellows , and what deeds they did ;</l>
     <l n="1090">Therefore , indeed , shall my first name be hid</l>
     <l n="1091">And my first country ; call me on this day</l>
     <l n="1092">The Ancient Knight , and let me go my way . ”</l>
     <l n="1093">He rose withal , for she her fingers fair</l>
     <l n="1094">Had drawn aback , and on him ‘ gan to stare</l>
     <l n="1095">As one afeard ; for something terrible</l>
     <l n="1096">Was in his speech , and that she knew right well ,</l>
     <l n="1097">Who ‘ gan to love him , and to fear that she ,</l>
     <l n="1098">Shut out by some strange deadly mystery ,</l>
     <l n="1099">Should never gain from him an equal love ;</l>
     <l n="1100">Yet , as from her high seat he ‘ gan to move ,</l>
     <l n="1101">She said , “ O Ancient Knight , come presently ,</l>
     <l n="1102">When we have done this muster , unto me ,</l>
     <l n="1103">And thou shalt have thy charge and due command</l>
     <l n="1104">For freeing from our foes this wretched land ! ”</l>
     <l n="1105">Then Ogier made his reverence and went ,</l>
     <l n="1106">And somewhat could perceive of her intent ;</l>
     <l n="1107">For in his heart life grew , and love with life</l>
     <l n="1108">Grew , and therewith , ‘ twixt love and fame , was strife .</l>
     <l n="1109">But , as he slowly gat him from the square ,</l>
     <l n="1110">Gazing at all the people gathered there ,</l>
     <l n="1111">A squire of the Queen 's behind him came ,</l>
     <l n="1112">And breathless , called him by his new-coined name ,</l>
     <l n="1113">And bade him turn because the Queen now bade ,</l>
     <l n="1114">Since by the muster long she might be stayed ,</l>
     <l n="1115">That to the palace he should bring him straight ,</l>
     <l n="1116">Midst sport and play her coming back to wait ;</l>
     <l n="1117">Then Ogier turned , nought loath , and with him went ,</l>
     <l n="1118">And to a postern-gate his steps he bent ,</l>
     <l n="1119">That Ogier knew right well in days of old ;</l>
     <l n="1120">Worn was it now , and the bright hues and gold</l>
     <l n="1121">Upon the shields above , with lapse of days ,</l>
     <l n="1122">Were faded much : but now did Ogier gaze</l>
     <l n="1123">Upon the garden where he walked of yore ,</l>
     <l n="1124">Holding the hands that he should see no more ;</l>
     <l n="1125">For all was changed except the palace fair ,</l>
     <l n="1126">That Charlemaine 's own eyes had seen built there</l>
     <l n="1127">Ere Ogier knew him ; there the squire did lead</l>
     <l n="1128">The Ancient Knight , who still took little heed</l>
     <l n="1129">Of all the things that by the way he said ,</l>
     <l n="1130">For all his thoughts were on the days long dead .</l>
     <l n="1131">There in the painted hall he sat again ,</l>
     <l n="1132">And ‘ neath the pictured eyes of Charlemaine</l>
     <l n="1133">He ate and drank , and felt it like a dream ;</l>
     <l n="1134">And midst his growing longings yet might deem</l>
     <l n="1135">That he from sleep should wake up presently</l>
     <l n="1136">In some fair city on the Syrian sea ,</l>
     <l n="1137">Or on the brown rocks of the loadstone isle .</l>
     <l n="1138">But fain to be alone , within a while</l>
     <l n="1139">He gat him to the garden , and there passed</l>
     <l n="1140">By wondering squires and damsels , till at last ,</l>
     <l n="1141">Far from the merry folk who needs must play ,</l>
     <l n="1142">If on the world were coming its last day ,</l>
     <l n="1143">He sat him down , and through his mind there ran</l>
     <l n="1144">Faint thoughts of that day , when , outworn and wan ,</l>
     <l n="1145">He lay down by the fountain-side to die .</l>
     <l n="1146">But when he strove to gain clear memory</l>
     <l n="1147">Of what had happed since on the isle he lay</l>
     <l n="1148">Waiting for death , a hopeless castaway ,</l>
     <l n="1149">Thought failing him , would rather bring again</l>
     <l n="1150">His life among the peers of Charlemaine ,</l>
     <l n="1151">And vex his soul with hapless memories ;</l>
     <l n="1152">Until at last , worn out by thought of these ,</l>
     <l n="1153">And hopeless striving to find what was true ,</l>
     <l n="1154">And pondering on the deeds he had to do</l>
     <l n="1155">Ere he returned , whereto he could not tell ,</l>
     <l n="1156">Sweet sleep upon his wearied spirit fell .</l>
     <l n="1157">And on the afternoon of that fair day ,</l>
     <l n="1158">Forgetting all , beneath the trees he lay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="1159">Meanwhile the Queen , affairs of state being done ,</l>
     <l n="1160">Went through the gardens with one dame alone</l>
     <l n="1161">Seeking for Ogier , whom at last she found</l>
     <l n="1162">Laid sleeping on the daisy-sprinkled ground ,</l>
     <l n="1163">Dreaming , I know not what , of other days .</l>
     <l n="1164">Then on him for a while the Queen did gaze ,</l>
     <l n="1165">Drawing sweet poison from the lovely sight ,</l>
     <l n="1166">Then to her fellow turned , “ The ancient Knight —</l>
     <l n="1167">What means he by this word of his ? ” she said ;</l>
     <l n="1168">“ He were well mated with some lovely maid</l>
     <l n="1169">Just pondering on the late-heard name of love . ”</l>
     <l n="1170">“ Softly , my lady , he begins to move , ”</l>
     <l n="1171">Her fellow said , a woman old and grey ;</l>
     <l n="1172">“ Look now , his arms are of another day ;</l>
     <l n="1173">None know him or his deeds ; thy squire just said</l>
     <l n="1174">He asked about the state of men long dead ;</l>
     <l n="1175">I fear what he may be ; look , seest thou not</l>
     <l n="1176">That ring that on one finger he has got ,</l>
     <l n="1177">Where figures strange upon the gold are wrought :</l>
     <l n="1178">God grant that he from hell has not been brought</l>
     <l n="1179">For our confusion , in this doleful war ,</l>
     <l n="1180">Who surely in enough of trouble are</l>
     <l n="1181">Without such help ; ” then the Queen turned aside</l>
     <l n="1182">Awhile , her drawn and troubled face to hide ,</l>
     <l n="1183">For lurking dread this speech within her stirred ;</l>
     <l n="1184">But yet she said , “ Thou sayest a foolish word ,</l>
     <l n="1185">This man is come against our enemies</l>
     <l n="1186">To fight for us . ” Then down upon her knees</l>
     <l n="1187">Fell the old woman by the sleeping knight ,</l>
     <l n="1188">And from his hand she drew with fingers light</l>
     <l n="1189">The wondrous ring , and scarce again could rise</l>
     <l n="1190">Ere ‘ neath the trembling Queen 's bewildered eyes</l>
     <l n="1191">The change began ; his golden hair turned white ,</l>
     <l n="1192">His smooth cheek wrinkled , and his breathing light</l>
     <l n="1193">Was turned to troublous struggling for his breath ,</l>
     <l n="1194">And on his shrunk lips lay the hand of death ;</l>
     <l n="1195">And , scarce less pale than he , the trembling Queen</l>
     <l n="1196">Stood thinking on the beauty she had seen</l>
     <l n="1197">And longed for but a little while ago ,</l>
     <l n="1198">Yet with her terror still her love did grow ,</l>
     <l n="1199">And she began to weep as though she saw</l>
     <l n="1200">Her beauty e'en to such an ending draw .</l>
     <l n="1201">And ‘ neath her tears waking he oped his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="1202">And strove to speak , but nought but gasping sighs</l>
     <l n="1203">His lips could utter ; then he tried to reach</l>
     <l n="1204">His hand to them , as though he would beseech</l>
     <l n="1205">The gift of what was his : but all the while</l>
     <l n="1206">The crone gazed on them with an evil smile ,</l>
     <l n="1207">Then holding toward the Queen that wondrous ring ,</l>
     <l n="1208">She said , “ Why weep'st thou ? having this fair thing ,</l>
     <l n="1209">Thou , losing nought the beauty that thou hast ,</l>
     <l n="1210">May'st watch the vainly struggling world go past ,</l>
     <l n="1211">Thyself unchanged . ” The Queen put forth her hand</l>
     <l n="1212">And took the ring , and there awhile did stand</l>
     <l n="1213">And strove to think of it , but still in her</l>
     <l n="1214">Such all-absorbing longings love did stir ,</l>
     <l n="1215">So young she was , of death she could not think ,</l>
     <l n="1216">Or what a cup eld gives to man to drink ;</l>
     <l n="1217">Yet on her finger had she set the ring</l>
     <l n="1218">When now the life that hitherto did cling</l>
     <l n="1219">To Ogier 's heart seemed fading quite away ,</l>
     <l n="1220">And scarcely breathing with shut eyes he lay .</l>
     <l n="1221">Then , kneeling down , she murmured piteously ,</l>
     <l n="1222">“ Ah , wilt thou love me if I give it thee ,</l>
     <l n="1223">And thou grow'st young again ? what should I do</l>
     <l n="1224">If with the eyes thou thus shalt gain anew</l>
     <l n="1225">Thou shouldst look scorn on me ? ” But with that word</l>
     <l n="1226">The hedge behind her , by the west wind stirred ,</l>
     <l n="1227">Cast fear into her heart of some one nigh ,</l>
     <l n="1228">And therewith on his finger hastily</l>
     <l n="1229">She set the ring , then rose and stood apart</l>
     <l n="1230">A little way , and in her doubtful heart</l>
     <l n="1231">With love and fear was mixed desire of life .</l>
     <l n="1232">But standing so , a look with great scorn rife</l>
     <l n="1233">The elder woman , turning , cast on her ,</l>
     <l n="1234">Pointing to Ogier , who began to stir ;</l>
     <l n="1235">She looked , and all she erst saw now did seem</l>
     <l n="1236">To have been nothing but a hideous dream ,</l>
     <l n="1237">As fair and young he rose from off the ground</l>
     <l n="1238">And cast a dazed and puzzled look around ,</l>
     <l n="1239">Like one just waked from sleep in some strange place ;</l>
     <l n="1240">But soon his grave eyes rested on her face ,</l>
     <l n="1241">And turned yet graver seeing her so pale ,</l>
     <l n="1242">And that her eyes were pregnant with some tale</l>
     <l n="1243">Of love and fear ; she ‘ neath his eyes the while</l>
     <l n="1244">Forced her pale lips to semblance of a smile ,</l>
     <l n="1245">And said , “ O Ancient Knight , thou sleepest then ?</l>
     <l n="1246">While through this poor land range the heathen men ,</l>
     <l n="1247">Unmet of any but my King and Lord :</l>
     <l n="1248">Nay , let us see the deeds of thine old sword . ”</l>
     <l n="1249">“ Queen , ” said he , “ bid me then unto this work ,</l>
     <l n="1250">And certes I behind no wall would lurk ,</l>
     <l n="1251">Nor send for succour , while a scanty folk</l>
     <l n="1252">Still followed after me to break the yoke :</l>
     <l n="1253">I pray thee grace for sleeping , and were fain</l>
     <l n="1254">That I might rather never sleep again</l>
     <l n="1255">Than have such wretched dreams as I e'en now</l>
     <l n="1256">Have waked from . ”</l>
     <l n="1257">Lovelier she seemed to grow</l>
     <l n="1258">Unto him as he spoke ; fresh colour came</l>
     <l n="1259">Into her face , as though for some sweet shame ,</l>
     <l n="1260">While she with tearful eyes beheld him so ,</l>
     <l n="1261">That somewhat even must his burnt cheek glow ,</l>
     <l n="1262">His heart beat faster . But again she said ,</l>
     <l n="1263">“ Nay , will dreams burden such a mighty head ?</l>
     <l n="1264">Then may I too have pardon for a dream :</l>
     <l n="1265">Last night in sleep I saw thee , who didst seem</l>
     <l n="1266">To be the King of France ; and thou and I</l>
     <l n="1267">Were sitting at some great festivity</l>
     <l n="1268">Within the many-peopled gold-hung place . ”</l>
     <l n="1269">The blush of shame was gone as on his face</l>
     <l n="1270">She gazed , and saw him read her meaning clear</l>
     <l n="1271">And knew that no cold words she had to fear ,</l>
     <l n="1272">But rather that for softer speech he yearned .</l>
     <l n="1273">Therefore , with love alone her smooth cheek burned ;</l>
     <l n="1274">Her parted lips were hungry for his kiss ,</l>
     <l n="1275">She trembled at the near approaching bliss ;</l>
     <l n="1276">Nathless , she checked her love a little while ,</l>
     <l n="1277">Because she felt the old dame 's curious smile</l>
     <l n="1278">Upon her , and she said , “ O Ancient Knight ,</l>
     <l n="1279">If I then read my last night 's dream aright ,</l>
     <l n="1280">Thou art come here our very help to be ,</l>
     <l n="1281">Perchance to give my husband back to me ;</l>
     <l n="1282">Come then , if thou this land art fain to save ,</l>
     <l n="1283">And show the wisdom thou must surely have</l>
     <l n="1284">Unto my council ; I will give thee then</l>
     <l n="1285">What charge I may among my valiant men ;</l>
     <l n="1286">And certes thou wilt do so well herein ,</l>
     <l n="1287">That , ere long , something greater shalt thou win :</l>
     <l n="1288">Come , then , deliverer of my throne and land ,</l>
     <l n="1289">And let me touch for once thy mighty hand</l>
     <l n="1290">With these weak fingers . ”</l>
     <l n="1291">As she spoke , she met</l>
     <l n="1292">His eager hand , and all things did forget</l>
     <l n="1293">But for one moment , for too wise were they</l>
     <l n="1294">To cast the coming years of joy away ;</l>
     <l n="1295">Then with her other hand her gown she raised</l>
     <l n="1296">And led him thence , and o'er her shoulder gazed</l>
     <l n="1297">At her old follower with a doubtful smile ,</l>
     <l n="1298">As though to say , “ Be wise , I know thy guile ! ”</l>
     <l n="1299">But slowly she behind the lovers walked ,</l>
     <l n="1300">Muttering , “ So be it ! thou shalt not be balked</l>
     <l n="1301">Of thy desire ; be merry ! I am wise ,</l>
     <l n="1302">Nor will I rob thee of thy Paradise</l>
     <l n="1303">For any other than myself ; and thou</l>
     <l n="1304">May'st even happen to have had enow</l>
     <l n="1305">Of this new love , before I get the ring ,</l>
     <l n="1306">And I may work for thee no evil thing . ”</l>

     <l n="1307">Now ye shall know that the old chronicle ,</l>
     <l n="1308">Wherein I read all this , doth duly tell</l>

     <l n="1311">If I therefore say little of these things ,</l>

     <l n="1318">That in the council chamber on that day</l>
     <l n="1319">The Old Knight showed his wisdom well enow ,</l>

     <l n="1321">Hearing his words , beholding his grey eyes</l>
     <l n="1322">Flashing with fire of warlike memories ;</l>
     <l n="1323">Yea , at the last he seemed so wise indeed</l>
     <l n="1324">That she could give him now the charge , to lead</l>
     <l n="1325">One wing of the great army that set out</l>
     <l n="1326">From Paris ’ gates , midst many a wavering shout</l>
     <l n="1327">Midst trembling prayers , and unchecked wails and tears ,</l>
     <l n="1328">And slender hopes and unresisted fears .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="34">
     <l n="1329">Now ere he went , upon his bed he lay ,</l>
     <l n="1330">Newly awakened at the dawn of day ,</l>
     <l n="1331">Gathering perplexed thoughts of many a thing ,</l>
     <l n="1332">When , midst the carol that the birds did sing</l>
     <l n="1333">Unto the coming of the hopeful sun ,</l>
     <l n="1334">He heard a sudden lovesome song begun</l>
     <l n="1335">‘ Twixt two young voices in the garden green ,</l>
     <l n="1336">That seemed indeed the farewell of the Queen .</l>

     <l n="19">There at a window was she waiting them</l>
     <l n="20">In fair attire with gold in every hem ,</l>
     <l n="21">And as the ancient Knight beneath her passed</l>
     <l n="22">A wreath of flowering white-thorn down she cast ,</l>

     <l n="35">Now I , though writing here no chronicle</l>

     <l n="37">That , ere the army Rouen 's gates could gain</l>
     <l n="38">By a broad arrow had the King been slain ,</l>
     <l n="39">And helpless now the wretched country lay</l>
     <l n="40">Beneath the yoke , until the glorious day</l>

     <l n="42">And scattered them as helplessly as though</l>
     <l n="43">They had been beaten men without a name :</l>
     <l n="44">So when to Paris town once more he came</l>
     <l n="45">Few folk the memory of the King did keep</l>
     <l n="46">Within their hearts , and if the folk did weep</l>
     <l n="47">At his returning , ‘ twas for joy indeed</l>
     <l n="48">That such a man had risen at their need</l>
     <l n="49">To work for them so great deliverance ,</l>
     <l n="50">And loud they called on him for King of France .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="51">But if the Queen 's heart were the more a-flame</l>
     <l n="52">For all that she had heard of his great fame ,</l>
     <l n="53">I know not ; rather with some hidden dread</l>
     <l n="54">Of coming fate , she heard her lord was dead ,</l>
     <l n="55">And her false dream seemed coming true at last ,</l>
     <l n="56">For the clear sky of love seemed overcast</l>
     <l n="57">With clouds of God 's great judgments , and the fear</l>
     <l n="58">Of hate and final parting drawing near .</l>
     <l n="59">So now when he before her throne did stand</l>
     <l n="60">Amidst the throng as saviour of the land ,</l>
     <l n="61">And she her eyes to his kind eyes did raise ,</l>
     <l n="62">And there before all her own love must praise ;</l>
     <l n="63">Then did she fall a-weeping , and folk said ,</l>

     <l n="68">So passed the year ,</l>

     <l n="72">Must he be crowned King of the twice-saved land ,</l>
     <l n="73">And at the altar take the fair Queen 's hand</l>
     <l n="74">And wed her for his own . And now by this</l>
     <l n="75">Had he forgotten clean the woe and bliss</l>
     <l n="76">Of his old life , and still was he made glad</l>
     <l n="77">As other men ; and hopes and fears he had</l>
     <l n="78">As others , and bethought him not at all</l>
     <l n="79">Of what strange days upon him yet should fall</l>
     <l n="80">When he should live and these again be dead .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="81">Now drew the time round when he should be wed ,</l>
     <l n="82">And in his palace on his bed he lay</l>
     <l n="83">Upon the dawning of the very day :</l>
     <l n="84">‘ Twixt sleep and waking was he , and could hear</l>
     <l n="85">E'en at that hour , through the bright morn and clear ,</l>
     <l n="86">The hammering of the folk who toiled to make</l>
     <l n="87">Some well-wrought stages for the pageant 's sake ,</l>
     <l n="88">Though hardly yet the sparrows had begun</l>
     <l n="89">To twitter o'er the coming of the sun ,</l>
     <l n="90">Nor through the palace did a creature move .</l>
     <l n="91">There in the sweet entanglement of love</l>
     <l n="92">Midst languid thoughts of greater bliss he lay ,</l>
     <l n="93">Remembering no more of that other day</l>
     <l n="94">Than the hot noon remembereth of the night ,</l>
     <l n="95">Than summer thinketh of the winter white .</l>
     <l n="96">In that sweet hour he heard a voice that cried ,</l>
     <l n="97">“ Ogier , Ogier ! ” then , opening his eyes wide ,</l>
     <l n="98">And rising on his elbow , gazed around ,</l>
     <l n="99">And strange to him and empty was the sound</l>
     <l n="100">Of his own name ; “ Whom callest thou ? ” he said .</l>
     <l n="101">“ For I , the man who lies upon this bed ,</l>

     <l n="106">And who art thou ? ” But at that word a sigh ,</l>
     <l n="107">As of one grieved , came from some place anigh</l>
     <l n="108">His bed-side , and a soft voice spake again ,</l>

     <l n="112">Bore forth the Oriflamme and gained the day ;</l>
     <l n="113">Charlot he brought back , whom men led away ,</l>
     <l n="114">And fought a day-long fight with Caraheu .</l>

     <l n="148">Thus is it , how then shall it be with thee ,</l>
     <l n="149">Who some faint image of eternity</l>
     <l n="150">Hast gained through me ?— alas , thou heedest not !</l>
     <l n="151">On all these changing things thine heart is hot —</l>
     <l n="152">Take then this gift that I have brought from far ,</l>
     <l n="153">And then may'st thou remember what we are ;</l>
     <l n="154">The lover and the loved from long ago . ”</l>
     <l n="155">He trembled , and more memory seemed to grow</l>
     <l n="156">Within his heart as he beheld her stand ,</l>
     <l n="157">Holding a glittering crown in her right hand :</l>
     <l n="158">“ Ogier , ” she said , “ arise and do on thee</l>
     <l n="159">The emblems of thy worldly sovereignity ,</l>
     <l n="160">For we must pass o'er many a sea this morn . ”</l>
     <l n="161">He rose , and in the glittering tunic worn</l>
     <l n="162">By Charlemaine he clad himself , and took</l>
     <l n="163">The ivory hand , that Charlemaine once shook</l>
     <l n="164">Over the people 's head in days of old ;</l>
     <l n="165">Then on his feet he set the shoes of gold ,</l>
     <l n="166">And o'er his shoulders threw the mantle fair ,</l>
     <l n="167">And set the gold crown on his golden hair :</l>
     <l n="168">Then on the royal chair he sat him down ,</l>
     <l n="169">As though he deemed the elders of the town</l>
     <l n="170">Should come to audience ; and in all he seemed</l>
     <l n="171">To do these things e'en as a man who dreamed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="172">And now adown the Seine the golden sun</l>
     <l n="173">Shone out , as toward him drew that lovely one</l>
     <l n="174">And took from off his head the royal crown ,</l>
     <l n="175">And , smiling , on the pillow laid it down</l>
     <l n="176">And said , “ Lie there , O crown of Charlemaine ,</l>
     <l n="177">Worn by a mighty man , and worn in vain ,</l>
     <l n="178">Because he died , and all the things he did</l>
     <l n="179">Were changed before his face by earth was hid ;</l>
     <l n="180">A better crown I have for my love 's head ,</l>
     <l n="181">Whereby he yet shall live , when all are dead</l>
     <l n="182">His hand has helped . ” Then on his head she set</l>
     <l n="183">The wondrous crown , and said , “ Forget , forget !</l>
     <l n="184">Forget these weary things , for thou hast much</l>
     <l n="185">Of happiness to think of . ”</l>
     <l n="186">At that touch</l>
     <l n="187">He rose , a happy light gleamed in his eyes ;</l>
     <l n="188">And smitten by the rush of memories ,</l>
     <l n="189">He stammered out , “ O love ! how came we here ?</l>
     <l n="190">What do we in this land of Death and Fear ?</l>
     <l n="191">Have I not been from thee a weary while ?</l>
     <l n="192">Let us return — I dreamed about the isle ;</l>
     <l n="193">I dreamed of other years of strife and pain ,</l>
     <l n="194">Of new years full of struggles long and vain . ”</l>
     <l n="195">She took him by the hand and said , “ Come , love ,</l>
     <l n="196">I am not changed ; ” and therewith did they move</l>
     <l n="197">Unto the door , and through the sleeping place</l>
     <l n="198">Swiftly they went , and still was Ogier 's face</l>
     <l n="199">Turned on her beauty , and no thought was his</l>
     <l n="200">Except the dear returning of his bliss .</l>
     <l n="201">But at the threshold of the palace-gate</l>
     <l n="202">That opened to them , she awhile did wait ,</l>
     <l n="203">And turned her eyes unto the rippling Seine</l>
     <l n="204">And said , “ O love , behold it once again ! ”</l>
     <l n="205">He turned , and gazed upon the city grey</l>
     <l n="206">Smit by the gold of that sweet morn of May ;</l>
     <l n="207">He heard faint noises as of wakening folk</l>
     <l n="208">As on their heads his day of glory broke ;</l>
     <l n="209">He heard the changing rush of the swift stream</l>
     <l n="210">Against the bridge-piers . All was grown a dream .</l>
     <l n="211">His work was over , his reward was come ,</l>
     <l n="212">Why should he loiter longer from his home ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="213">A little while she watched him silently ,</l>
     <l n="214">Then beckoned him to follow with a sigh ,</l>
     <l n="215">And , raising up the raiment from her feet ,</l>
     <l n="216">Across the threshold stepped into the street ;</l>
     <l n="217">One moment on the twain the low sun shone ,</l>
     <l n="218">And then the place was void , and they were gone</l>
     <l n="219">How I know not ; but this I know indeed ,</l>
     <l n="220">That in whatso great trouble or sore need</l>
     <l n="221">The land of France since that fair day has been ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="223">Such was the tale he told of Avallon ,</l>

     <l n="227">Not much to be desired now it seemed —</l>
     <l n="228">Perchance the heart that of such things had dreamed</l>
     <l n="229">Had found no words in this death-laden tongue</l>
     <l n="230">We speak on earth , wherewith they might be sung ;</l>
     <l n="231">Perchance the changing years that changed his heart</l>
     <l n="232">E'en in the words of that old tale had part ,</l>
     <l n="233">Changing its sweet to bitter , to despair</l>
     <l n="234">The foolish hope that once had glittered there —</l>
     <l n="235">Or think , that in some bay of that far home</l>
     <l n="236">They then had sat , and watched the green waves come</l>
     <l n="237">Up to their feet with many promises ;</l>
     <l n="238">Or the light wind midst blossom-laden trees ,</l>
     <l n="239">In the sweet Spring had weighted many a word</l>
     <l n="240">Of no worth now , and many a hope had stirred</l>
     <l n="241">Long dead for ever .</l>
     <l n="242">Howsoe'er that be</l>
     <l n="243">Among strange folk they now sat quietly ,</l>

     <l n="245">As though its hopes and fears were something new .</l>
     <l n="246">But though , indeed , the outworn , dwindled band</l>
     <l n="247">Had no tears left for that once longed-for land ,</l>
     <l n="248">The very wind must moan for their decay ,</l>
     <l n="249">And from the sky , grown dull , and low , and grey ,</l>
     <l n="250">Cold tears must fall upon the lonely field ,</l>
     <l n="251">That such fair golden hopes erewhile did yield ;</l>
     <l n="252">And on the blackening woods , wherein the doves</l>
     <l n="253">Sat silent now , forgetful of their loves .</l>
     <l n="254">Yet , since a little life at least was left ,</l>
     <l n="255">They were not yet of every joy bereft ,</l>
     <l n="256">For long ago was past the agony ,</l>
     <l n="257">Midst which they found that they indeed must die ;</l>
     <l n="258">And now well-nigh as much their pain was past</l>
     <l n="259">As though death 's veil already had been cast</l>
     <l n="260">Over their heads — so , midst some little mirth ,</l>
     <l n="261">They watched the dark night hide the gloomy earth .</l>

    <head>THE GOLDEN APPLES .</head>
    <head>This tale tells of the voyage of a ship of Tyre , that , against the will of the shipmen , bore Hercules to an unknown land of the West , that he might accomplish a task laid on him by the Fates .</head>

     <l n="4">In fair Mycenae ; midmost of whose day</l>
     <l n="5">It once befell that in a quiet bay</l>
     <l n="6">A ship of Tyre was swinging nigh the shore ,</l>
     <l n="7">Her folk for sailing handling rope and oar .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">Fresh was the summer morn , a soft wind stole</l>
     <l n="9">Down from the sheep-browsed slopes the cliffs that crowned ,</l>
     <l n="10">And ruffled lightly the long gleaming roll</l>
     <l n="11">Of the peaceful sea , and bore along the sound</l>
     <l n="12">Of shepherd-folk and sheep and questing hound ,</l>
     <l n="13">For in the first dip of the hillside there</l>
     <l n="14">Lay bosomed ‘ mid its trees a homestead fair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">Amid regrets for last night , when the moon ,</l>
     <l n="16">Risen on the soft dusk , shone on maidens ’ feet</l>
     <l n="17">Brushing the gold-heart lilies to the tune</l>
     <l n="18">Of pipes complaining , o'er the grass down-beat</l>
     <l n="19">That mixed with dewy flowers its odour sweet ,</l>
     <l n="20">The shipmen laboured , till the sail unfurled</l>
     <l n="21">Swung round the prow to meet another world .</l>

     <l n="22">But ere the anchor had come home , a shout</l>

     <l n="24">Whereat the master bade them stay , in doubt</l>
     <l n="25">That they without some needful thing had sailed ;</l>
     <l n="26">When , lo ! from where the cliff 's steep grey sides failed</l>
     <l n="27">Into a ragged stony slip , came twain</l>

     <l n="29">Soon they drew nigh , and he who first came down</l>
     <l n="30">Unto the surf was a man huge of limb ,</l>
     <l n="31">Grey-eyed , with crisp-curled hair ‘ twixt black and brown ,</l>
     <l n="32">Who had a lion 's skin cast over him ,</l>
     <l n="33">So wrought with gold that the fell showed but dim</l>
     <l n="34">Betwixt the threads , and in his hand he bore</l>

     <l n="36">Panting there followed him a grey old man ,</l>

     <l n="39">Who when unto his fellow 's side he drew ,</l>
     <l n="40">Said faintly : “ Now , do that which thou shouldst do ;</l>

     <l n="53">The old man muttered , stooped adown and caught</l>
     <l n="54">At something in the sand : “ E'en so I thought , ”</l>
     <l n="55">The younger said , “ when I set out from home —</l>

     <l n="60">For from his arm a huge ring did he take ,</l>
     <l n="61">And cast it on the deck , where it did break</l>
     <l n="62">A water-jar , and in the wet shards lay</l>
     <l n="63">Golden , and gleaming like the end of day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">

     <l n="71">From one to the other turned the master 's eyes ;</l>

     <l n="74">But thinking on the thing , he deemed it best</l>
     <l n="75">To bid them come aboard , and take such rest</l>

     <l n="81">Strode to the ship , right through the breakers low ,</l>
     <l n="82">And catching at the rope that they did throw</l>
     <l n="83">Out toward his hand , swung up into the ship ;</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>BOOK II .</head>
    <head>R E G I N .</head>
    <head>Now this is the first book of the life and death of Sigurd the Volsung , and therein is told of the birth of him , and of his dealings with Regin the master of masters , and of his deeds in the waste places of the earth .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Of the birth of Sigurd the son of Sigmund .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Peace lay on the land of the Helper and the house of Elf his son ;</l>
     <l n="3">There merry men went bedward when their tide of toil was done ,</l>
     <l n="4">And glad was the dawn 's awakening , and the noontide fair and glad :</l>
     <l n="5">There no great store had the franklin , and enough the hireling had ;</l>
     <l n="6">And a child might go unguarded the length and breadth of the land</l>
     <l n="7">With a purse of gold at his girdle and gold rings on his hand .</l>
     <l n="8">‘ Twas a country of cunning craftsmen , and many a thing they wrought ,</l>
     <l n="9">That the lands of storm desired , and the homes of warfare sought .</l>
     <l n="10">But men deemed it o'erhYpppHeNwell warded by more than its stems of fight ,</l>
     <l n="11">And told how its earth-born watchers yet lived of plenteous might .</l>
     <l n="12">So hidden was that country , and few men sailed its sea ,</l>
     <l n="13">And none came o'er its mountains of men-folk 's company .</l>
     <l n="14">But fair-fruited , many-peopled , it lies a goodly strip ,</l>
     <l n="15">‘ Twixt the mountains cloudy-headed and the sea-flood 's surging lip ,</l>
     <l n="16">And a perilous flood is its ocean , and its mountains , who shall tell</l>
     <l n="17">What things in their dales deserted and their wind-swept heaths may dwell .</l>
     <l n="18">Now a man of the Kings , called Gripir , in this land of peace abode :</l>
     <l n="19">The son of the Helper 's father , though never lay his load</l>
     <l n="20">In the womb of the mother of Kings that the Helper 's brethren bore ;</l>
     <l n="21">But of Giant kin was his mother , of the folk that are seen no more ;</l>
     <l n="22">Though whiles as ye ride some fell-road across the heath there comes</l>
     <l n="23">The voice of their lone lamenting o'er their changed and conquered homes .</l>
     <l n="24">A long way off from the sea-strand and beneath the mountains ’ feet</l>
     <l n="25">Is the high-built hall of Gripir , where the waste and the tillage meet ;</l>
     <l n="26">A noble and plentiful house , that a little men-folk fear ,</l>
     <l n="27">But beloved of the crag-dwelling eagles and the kin of the woodland deer .</l>
     <l n="28">A man of few words was Gripir , but he knew of all deeds that had been ,</l>
     <l n="29">And times there came upon him , when the deeds to be were seen :</l>
     <l n="30">No sword had he held in his hand since his father fell to field ,</l>
     <l n="31">And against the life of the slayer he bore undinted shield :</l>
     <l n="32">Yet no fear in his heart abided , nor desired he aught at all ,</l>
     <l n="33">But he noted the deeds that had been , and looked for what should befall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="34">Again , in the house of the Helper there dwelt a certain man</l>
     <l n="35">Beardless and low of stature , of visage pinched and wan :</l>
     <l n="36">So exceeding old was Regin , that no son of man could tell</l>
     <l n="37">In what year of the days passed over he came to that land to dwell ;</l>
     <l n="38">But the youth of King Elf had he fostered , and the Helper 's youth thereto ,</l>
     <l n="39">Yes and his father 's father 's : the lore of all men he knew ,</l>
     <l n="40">And was deft in every cunning , save the dealings of the sword :</l>
     <l n="41">So sweet was his tongue-speech fashioned , that men trowed his every word ;</l>
     <l n="42">His hand with the harp-strings blended was the mingler of delight</l>
     <l n="43">With the latter days of sorrow ; all tales he told aright ;</l>
     <l n="44">The Master of the Masters in the smithying craft was he ;</l>
     <l n="45">And he dealt with the wind and the weather and the stilling of the sea ;</l>
     <l n="46">Nor might any learn him leech-craft , for before that race was made ,</l>
     <l n="47">And that man-folk 's generation , all their life-days had he weighed .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">

     <l n="51">hour</l>
     <l n="52">Have the deeds of the Volsungs blossomed , and born their latest flower ;</l>
     <l n="53">In the bed there lieth a man child , and his eyes look straight on the sun ,</l>
     <l n="54">And lo , the hope of the people , and the days of a king are begun .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="55">Men say of the serving-women , when they cried on the joy of the morn ,</l>
     <l n="56">When they handled the linen raiment , and washed the king new-born ,</l>
     <l n="57">When they bore him back unto Hiordis , and the weary and happy breast ,</l>
     <l n="58">And bade her be glad to behold it , how the best was sprung from the best ,</l>
     <l n="59">Yet they shrank in their rejoicing before the eyes of the child ,</l>
     <l n="60">So bright and dreadful were they ; yea though the spring morn smiled ,</l>
     <l n="61">And a thousand birds were singing round the fair familiar home ,</l>
     <l n="62">And still as on other mornings they saw folk go and come ,</l>
     <l n="63">Yet the hour seemed awful to them , and the hearts within them burned</l>
     <l n="64">As though of fateful matters their souls were newly learned .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="65">But Hiordis looked on the Volsung , on her grief and her fond desire ,</l>
     <l n="66">And the hope of her heart was quickened , and her joy was a living fire ;</l>
     <l n="67">And she said : “ Now one of the earthly on the eyes of my child hath gazed</l>
     <l n="68">Nor shrunk before their glory , nor stayed her love amazed :</l>
     <l n="69">I behold thee as Sigmund beholdeth ,— and I was the home of thine heart —</l>
     <l n="70">Woe 's me for the day when thou wert not , and the hour when we shall part ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="71">Then she held him a little season on her weary and happy breast</l>
     <l n="72">And she told him of Sigmund and Volsung and the best sprung forth from</l>
     <l n="73">the best :</l>
     <l n="74">She spake to the new-born baby as one who might understand ,</l>
     <l n="75">And told him of Sigmund 's battle , and the dead by the sea-flood 's strand ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="77">So she spake , and the sun rose higher , and her speech at last was spent ,</l>
     <l n="78">And she gave him back to the women to bear forth to the people 's kings ,</l>
     <l n="79">That they too may rejoice in her glory and her day of happy things .</l>

How many things shalt thou waken , how many lull to sleep ! How many things shalt thou scatter , how many gather and keep ! O me , how thy love shall cherish , how thine hate shall wither and burn ! How the hope shall be sped from thy right hand , nor the fear to thy left return ! O thy deeds that men shall sing of ! O thy deeds that the Gods shall see ! O SIGURD , Son of the Volsungs , O Victory yet to be ! ”</p>

     <l n="10">Then Regin answered and said : “ Thy kin of the Kings of yore</l>

     <l n="15">He spake and his harp was with him , and he smote the strings full sweet ,</l>

     <l n="35">Ye shall give me a token for Gripir , and bid him to let me choose</l>
     <l n="36">From out of the noble stud-beasts that run in his meadow loose .</l>
     <l n="37">But if overmuch I have asked you , forget this prayer of mine ,</l>
     <l n="38">And deem the word unspoken , and get ye to the wine . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="39">Then smiled King Elf , and answered : “ A long way wilt thou ride ,</l>

     <l n="41">Yea unto the death at the last : yet surely shalt thou win</l>
     <l n="42">The praise of many a people : so have thy way herein .</l>
     <l n="43">Forsooth no more may we hold thee than the hazel copse may hold</l>
     <l n="44">The sun of the early dawning , that turneth it all unto gold . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="45">Then sweetly Sigurd thanked them ; and through the night he lay</l>
     <l n="46">Mid dreams of many a matter till the dawn was on the way ;</l>
     <l n="47">Then he shook the sleep from off him , and that dwelling of Kings he left</l>
     <l n="48">And wended his ways unto Gripir . On a crag from the mountain reft</l>
     <l n="49">Was the house of the old King builded ; and a mighty house it was ,</l>
     <l n="50">Though few were the sons of men that over its threshold would pass :</l>
     <l n="51">But the wild ernes cried about it , and the vultures toward it flew ,</l>
     <l n="52">And the winds from the heart of the mountains searched every chamber</l>
     <l n="53">through ,</l>
     <l n="54">And about were meads wide-spreading ; and many a beast thereon ,</l>
     <l n="55">Yea some that are men-folk 's terror , their sport and pasture won .</l>
     <l n="56">So into the hall went Sigurd ; and amidst was Gripir set</l>
     <l n="57">In a chair of the sea-beast 's tooth ; and his sweeping beard nigh met</l>
     <l n="58">The floor that was green as the ocean , and his gown was of mountain-gold</l>
     <l n="59">And the kingly staff in his hand was knobbed with the crystal cold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="60">Now the first of the twain spake Gripir : “ Hail King with the eyen bright !</l>
     <l n="61">Nought needest thou show the token , for I know of thy life and thy light .</l>
     <l n="62">And no need to tell of thy message ; it was wafted here on the wind ,</l>
     <l n="63">That thou wouldst be coming to-day a horse in my meadow to find :</l>
     <l n="64">And strong must he be for the bearing of those deeds of thine that shall</l>
     <l n="65">be .</l>
     <l n="66">Now choose thou of all the way-wearers that are running loose in my lea ,</l>
     <l n="67">And be glad as thine heart will have thee and the fate that leadeth thee</l>
     <l n="68">on ,</l>
     <l n="69">And I bid thee again come hither when the sword of worth is won ,</l>
     <l n="70">And thy loins are girt for thy going on the road that before thee lies ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="72">Then again gat Sigurd outward , and adown the steep he ran</l>
     <l n="73">And unto the horse-fed meadow : but lo , a grey-clad man ,</l>
     <l n="74">One-eyed and seeming-ancient , there met him by the way :</l>
     <l n="75">And he spake : “ Thou hastest , Sigurd ; yet tarry till I say</l>
     <l n="76">A word that shall well bestead thee : for I know of these mountains well</l>
     <l n="77">And all the lea of Gripir , and the beasts that thereon dwell . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="78">“ Wouldst thou have red gold for thy tidings ? art thou Gripir 's horse-herd</l>
     <l n="79">then ?</l>
     <l n="80">Nay sure , for thy face is shining like battle-eager men</l>
     <l n="81">My master Regin tells of : and I love thy cloud-grey gown</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="83">“ Nay whiles have I heeded the horse-kind , ” then spake that elder of days ,</l>
     <l n="84">“ And sooth do the sages say , when the beasts of my breeding they praise .</l>
     <l n="85">There is one thereof in the meadow , and , wouldst thou cull him out ,</l>
     <l n="86">Thou shalt follow an elder 's counsel , who hath brought strange things</l>
     <l n="87">about ,</l>
     <l n="88">Who hath known thy father aforetime , and other kings of thy kin . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="89">So Sigurd said , “ I am ready ; and what is the deed to win ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="90">He said : “ We shall drive the horses adown to the water-side ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="92">Then the twain sped on together , and they drave the horses on</l>
     <l n="93">Till they came to a rushing river a water wide and wan ;</l>
     <l n="94">And the white mews hovered o'er it ; but none might hear their cry</l>
     <l n="95">For the rush and the rattle of waters , as the downlong flood swept by .</l>
     <l n="96">So the whole herd took the river and strove the stream to stem ,</l>
     <l n="97">And many a brave steed was there ; but the flood o'ermastered them :</l>
     <l n="98">And some , it swept them down-ward , and some won back to bank ,</l>
     <l n="99">Some , caught by the net of the eddies , in the swirling hubbub sank ;</l>
     <l n="100">But one of all swam over , and they saw his mane of grey</l>
     <l n="101">Toss over the flowery meadows , a bright thing far away :</l>
     <l n="102">Wide then he wheeled about them , then took the stream again</l>
     <l n="103">And with the waves ’ white horses mingled his cloudy mane .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="104">Then spake the elder of days : “ Hearken now , Sigurd , and hear ;</l>
     <l n="105">Time was when I gave thy father a gift thou shalt yet deem dear ,</l>
     <l n="106">And this horse is a gift of my giving :— heed nought where thou mayst ride :</l>
     <l n="107">For I have seen thy fathers in a shining house abide ,</l>
     <l n="108">And on earth they thought of its threshold , and the gifts I had to give ;</l>
     <l n="109">Nor prayed for a little longer , and a little longer to live . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="110">Then forth he strode to the mountains , and fain was Sigurd now</l>
     <l n="111">To ask him many a matter : but dim did his bright shape grow ,</l>
     <l n="112">As a man from the litten doorway fades into the dusk of night ;</l>
     <l n="113">And the sun in the high-noon shone , and the world was exceeding bright .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="114">So Sigurd turned to the river and stood by the wave-wet strand ,</l>
     <l n="115">And the grey horse swims to his feet and lightly leaps aland ,</l>
     <l n="116">And the youngling looks upon him , and deems none beside him good .</l>
     <l n="117">And indeed , as tells the story , he was come of Sleipnir 's blood ,</l>
     <l n="118">The tireless horse of Odin : cloud-grey he was of hue ,</l>
     <l n="119">And it seemed as Sigurd backed him that Sigmund 's son he knew ,</l>
     <l n="120">So glad he went beneath him . Then the youngling 's song arose</l>
     <l n="121">As he brushed through the noon-tide blossoms of Gripir 's mighty close ,</l>
     <l n="122">Then he singeth the song of Greyfell , the horse that Odin gave ,</l>
     <l n="123">Who swam through the sweeping river , and back through the toppling wave .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="124">Regin telleth Sigurd of his kindred , and of the Gold that was</l>

     <l n="126">Now yet the days pass over , and more than words may tell</l>

     <l n="129">To know of what lies beyond them , and learn of the wide world 's gain .</l>
     <l n="130">And he saith : “ I dwell in a land that is ruled by none of my blood ;</l>
     <l n="131">And my mother 's sons are waxing , and fair kings shall they be and good ;</l>
     <l n="132">And their servant or their betrayer — not one of these will I be .</l>
     <l n="133">Yet needs must I wait for a little till Odin calls for me . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="134">Now again it happed on a day that he sat in Regin 's hall</l>

     <l n="136">And of kings that sought their kingdoms o'er many a waste and wild ,</l>
     <l n="137">And at last saith the crafty master :</l>
     <l n="138">“ Thou art King Sigmund 's child :</l>
     <l n="139">Wilt thou wait till these kings of the carles shall die in a little land ,</l>
     <l n="140">Or wilt thou serve their sons and carry the cup to their hand ;</l>
     <l n="141">Or abide in vain for the day that never shall come about ,</l>
     <l n="142">When their banners shall dance in the wind and shake to the war-gods ’</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="144">Then Sigurd answered and said : “ Nought such do I look to be .</l>

     <l n="146">And these folk are good and trusty , and the land is lovely and sweet ,</l>
     <l n="147">And in rest and in peace it lieth as the floor of Odin 's feet :</l>
     <l n="148">Yet I know that the world is wide , and filled with deeds unwrought ;</l>

     <l n="39">And their still unquenched desire for garnering fame 's increase ?</l>
     <l n="40">E'en so do I hearken thy words : for I wot how they deem it long</l>
     <l n="41">Till a man from their seed be arisen to deal with the cumber and wrong .</l>
     <l n="42">Bid me therefore to sit by thy side , for behold I wend on my way ,</l>
     <l n="43">And the gates swing to behind me , and each day of mine is a day</l>
     <l n="44">With deeds in the eve and the morning , nor deeds shall the noontide lack ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="46">“ Come , kin of the Gods , ” said Gripir , “ come up and sit by my side</l>
     <l n="47">That we twain may be glad as the fearless , and they that have nothing</l>
     <l n="48">to hide :</l>
     <l n="49">I have wrought out my will and abide it , and I sit ungrieved and alone ,</l>
     <l n="50">I look upon men and I help not ; to me are the deeds long done</l>

     <l n="53">Then Sigurd came unto Gripir , and he kissed the wise-one 's face ,</l>

     <l n="55">And they drank of the wine of King-folk , and were joyful each of each ,</l>

     <l n="60">And the halls where the Sea-Queen 's kindred o'er the gem-strewn pavement</l>
     <l n="61">walk ,</l>
     <l n="62">And the innermost parts of the earth , where they lie , the green and the</l>

     <l n="68">And the sheathed Wrath was hearkening and a song of war it sang ,</l>
     <l n="69">But Sigurd spake unto Gripir :</l>

     <l n="72">And the guileless heart of the great that knoweth not anger nor pain :</l>
     <l n="73">So once hath a man been fashioned and shall not be again .</l>
     <l n="74">But for me hath been foaled the war-horse , the grey steed swift as the</l>

     <l n="76">And for me were the edges smithied , and the Wrath cries out aloud ;</l>

     <l n="104">Piled high aloft to the heavens uprose that battle-wall ,</l>
     <l n="105">And far o'er the topmost shield-rim for a banner of fame there hung</l>
