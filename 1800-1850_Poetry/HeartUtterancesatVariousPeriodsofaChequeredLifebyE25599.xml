    <docTitle><titlePart>Heart Utterances . FIRST ATTEMPT AT RHYME . KINDNESS . Kindness soothes the bitter anguish , Kindness wipes the falling tear , Kindness cheers us when we languish , Kindness makes a friend more dear . Kindness turns a pain to pleasure , Kindness softens every woe , Kindness is the greatest treasure , That frail man enjoys below . Then how can I , so frail a being , Hope thy kindness to repay , My great weakness plainly seeing , Seeing plainer every day . Oh , I never can repay thee ! That I but too plainly see ; But I trust thou wilt forgive me , For the love I bear to thee .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint><date>1811</date>. E. P. K. WRITTEN AT THE DELAWARE WATER GAP . Great and omnipotent that Power must be , That wings the whirlwind and directs the storm , That , by a strong convulsion , severed thee , And wrought this wondrous chasm in thy form . Man is a dweller , where , in some past day , Thy rock-ribbed frame majestically rose ; The river rushes on its new-made way , And all is life where all was once repose . Pleased , as I gazed upon thy lofty brow Where Nature seems her loveliest robes to wear , I felt that Pride at such a scene must bow , And own its insignificancy there . Oh Thou , to whom directing worlds is play , Thy condescension without bounds must be , If man , the frail ephemera of a day , Be graciously regarded still by Thee . Here , as I ponder on Thy mighty deeds , And marvel at Thy bounteousness to me , While wrapt in solemn awe , my bosom bleeds , Lest recklessly I may have wounded Thee ,— Wounded that Being who is fain to call The heavy-laden and the wearied home ; The dear Redeemer ! He who died that all Might to his glorious in-gathering come .<date>1818</date>. E. P. K. WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM . Judge we of coming , by the by-past , years , And still can Hope , the siren , soothe our fears ? Cheated , deceived , our cherished day-dreams o'er , We cling the closer , and we trust the more . Oh , who can say there 's bliss in the review Of hours , when Hope with fairy fingers drew A magic sketch of “ rapture yet to be , ” A rainbow horizon , a life of glee ! The world all bright before us — vivid scene Of cloudless sunshine and of fadeless green ; A treacherous picture of our coming years , Bright in prospective — welcomed but with tears . How false the view , a backward glance will tell ! A tale of visions wrecked , of broken spell , Of valued hearts estranged or careless grown , Affection 's links dissevered or unknown ; Of joys , deemed fadeless , gone to swift decay , And love 's broad circle dwindled half away ; Of early graves of friends who , one by one , Leave us at last to journey on alone . Turn to the home of childhood — hallowed spot , Through life 's vicissitudes still unforgot ; The sacred hearth deserted now is found , Or unloved stranger-forms are circling round . In the dear hall , whose sounds were all our own , Are other voices , other accents known ; And where our early friends ? A starting tear And the rude headstone promptly answer , “ Here . ” Thus will compare Hope 's sketch of bliss to be With the undreamed of , sad reality ; Yet this and more the afflicted heart may bear , If Faith , celestial visitant , be there , Whispering of greener shores , of purer skies , Of flowers unfading , love that never dies , A glimpse of joy to come in mercy given , The eternal sunshine of approving Heaven .<date>1818</date>. E. P. K. ON READING “ GIBBON 'S ROME . ” And this man was “ an infidel ! ” Ah , no ! The tale 's incredible — it was not so . The untutored savage through the world may plod , Reckless of Heaven and ignorant of his God ; But that a mind that 's culled improvement 's flowers From all her brightest amaranthine bowers , A mind whose keen and comprehensive glance Comprised at once a world — should worship chance , Is strangely inconsistent — seems to me The very essence of absurdity ; Who , from the exhaustless granary of Heaven , Receives the blessings so profusely given , Looks with a curious eye on Nature 's face , Forever beaming with a new-born grace , And dares with impious voice aloud proclaim He knows no Heaven but this — no God but Fame . Lord , in refusing to acknowledge Thee , Vain man denies his own reality ; But tho ’ the boon of life he may receive From God , and still affect to disbelieve , What are his views at death 's resounding knell ? Just Heaven ! Sure , man ne'er died an infidel . Stretched on the agonizing couch of pain , All human aid inefficacious , vain , Where shall his tortured spirit rest ? Ah , where ? The past , all gloom ! the future , all despair ! ‘ Tis then , O Lord , the skeptic turns to Thee , Then the proud scoffer humbly bends the knee ; Feels in this darksome hour there 's much to do — Earth fading fast , Heaven 's portals far from view . Oh , what a hopeless wretch this man must be ! His very soul weeps tears of agony . Dying he owns there is a God above , A God of Justice , tho ’ a Prince of Love .<date>1820</date>. E. P. K. WRITTEN IN A FRIEND 'S ALBUM . Trust not Hope 's illusive ray , Trust not Joy 's deceitful smiles ; Oft they reckless youth betray With their bland , seductive wiles . I have proved them all , alas ! Transient as the hues of eve ; Meteor-like , they quickly pass Through the bosoms they deceive . Let not Love thy prospects gild ; Soon they will be clouded o'er , And the budding heart once chilled , It can brightly bloom no more . Slumber not in Pleasure 's beam ; It may sparkle for a while , But ‘ tis transient as a dream , Faithless as a foeman 's smile . There 's a light that 's brighter far , Soothes the soul by anguish riven , ‘ Tis Religion 's guiding star Glittering on the verge of Heaven . Oh ! this beam divine is worth All the charm that life can give ; ‘ Tis not false as things of earth , Trust it then , ‘ twill ne'er deceive .<date>1821</date>. E. P. K. WRITTEN AFTER A VISIT TO THE INSTITUTION FOR THE DEAF AND DUMB . I thought those youthful hearts were bleak and bare , That not a germ had ever flourished there , Unless perchance the night-shade of despair , Which blooms amid the sunless wilderness . But I was told that flowers of fairest kind Graced what I deemed a desert of the mind , That for these hapless beings man had twined A fadeless wreath to make their sorrows less . And then I feared , like sunbeams of the morn Which spoil the frost-work they awhile adorn , That rays of light might render more forlorn The expanding bosoms they were meant to cheer . I feared those glittering beams would vainly show That the best charms of life they ne'er could know , “ The feast of reason and the soul 's calm flow , ” The witchery of sound , the bliss to hear . But when I saw those eyes mirthful and bright , And beaming soft with intellectual light , My groundless fears that moment winged their flight , I felt that joy would on their path attend . May Heaven this favored Institution bless , Man 's “ high endeavor ” crown with “ glad success , ” And on each patron 's noble brow impress The glorious title of “ The dumb man 's friend . ”<date>1822</date>. E. P. K. TIME . Oh ! Time , as it fleets , dooms a joy to decay , From the chaplet of hope steals a blossom away , Throws a cloud o'er the lustre of life 's fairy scene , And leaves but a thorn where the rosebud had been . It sullies a link in affection 's young chain , That , once slightly tarnished , ne'er sparkles again , Spoils the sheaves that the heart in its summer would bind , To guard ‘ gainst a bleak , leafless autumn of mind . But a region there is where the buds never die , Where the sun meets no cloud in his path through the sky , Where the rose-wreath of joy is immortal in bloom , And pours on the gale a celestial perfume ; Where ethereal melodies steal through the soul , And the full tide of rapture is free from control . Oh , we 've nothing to do in a bleak world like this , But to toil for a home in that haven of bliss .<date>1822</date>. E. P. K. ( Added in 11th mo .,<date>1861</date>. )</docImprint>

     <p>“ Nay , toil not , ” saith Jesus , “ but come unto Me ; ” There 's rest for the weary , rest even for thee — I have toiled , and have suffered , and died for thy sin ; Then only believe , and the crown thou shalt win , The crown of Eternal Life , fadeless and bright , Prepared for all nations who walk in the light . E. P. G. ON LEAVING PINE COTTAGE . When our bosoms were lightest , And day-dreams were brightest , The gay vision melted away ; By sorrow ‘ twas shaded , Too quickly it faded ; How transient its halcyon sway ! From my heart would you sever , ( Harsh fate ! ) and forever , The friends who to life gave a charm , What oblivion effaces Fond mem'ry retraces , And pictures each well-beloved form . Some accent well known , Some melodious tone , Through my bosom like witchery shed , Shall awake the sad sigh , To the hours gone by , And the friends , like a fairy dream , fled . Long remembrance shall treasure Those moments of pleasure , When time flew unheeded away ; Joy 's light skiff was near us , Hope ventured to steer us , And brighten our path with her ray . We sailed down the stream ‘ Neath her luminous beam , Our spirits were closely entwined ; What are joys of the bowl To this calm flow of soul , This heavenly mingling of mind ? Pure Friendship was there With celestial air , Her cestus around us she threw ; “ Be united , ” she cried , “ Ne'er may discord divide A union so blissful and true . ” But those hours are past , They were too bright to last ; Joyous moments but seldom are given , That man may be taught , Worldly pleasures are naught ,— True happiness dwells but in Heaven .</p>
    </epigraph>
    <docImprint><date>1822</date>. E. P. K. THE MORN AND EVE OF LIFE . So soft Time 's plumage in life 's budding spring , We rarely note the flutter of his wing . The untutored heart , from pain and sadness free , Beats high with hope and joy and ecstasy ; And the fond bosoms of confiding youth Believe their fairy world a world of truth . The thorn is young upon the rose 's stem ; They heed it not , it has no wound for them . While yet the heart is new to misery , There is a gloss on everything we see ; There is a freshness , which returns no more When fades the morn of life that soon is o'er ; A warmth of feeling , ardency of joy , Delight almost exempt from an alloy , A zest for pleasure , fearlessness of pain , That we are destined ne'er to know again . And what succeeds this era joyous , bright ? Is it a cloudless eve or starless night ? To those who 're busied in life 's brilliant dawn With gathering flowers that bloom when spring is gone , And , ere their morning sun begins to wane , Add many a link to fond affection 's chain , To Heaven 's supreme behest have meekly bowed — ‘ Twill prove indeed an eve without a cloud . What though the brilliancy and sheen of day With youthful hours have faded all away ; What though the fresh and roseate bloom of spring A fragrance in our path no more shall fling ; Yet there 's a foretaste pure of joys divine , A quiet , holy calm in life 's decline , A moonlight of the soul in mercy given To light the pilgrim to the gates of Heaven .<date>1824</date>. E. P. K. THE EVENING STAR . Hail , pensile gem , that thus can softly gild The starry coronal of quiet eve ! What frost-work fabrics man shall vainly build Ere thou art doomed thy heavenly post to leave ! Bright star ! thou seem'st to me a blest retreat , The wearied pilgrim 's paradise of rest ; I love to think long-parted friends shall meet , Blissful reunion ! in thy tranquil breast . I saw thee shine when life with me was young , And fresh as fleet-winged time 's infantile hour , When Hope her treacherous chaplet ‘ round me flung , And daily twined a new-created flower . I saw thee shine while yet the sacred smile Of home and kindred round my path would play , But Time , who loves our fairest joys to spoil , Destined this hour of bloom to swift decay . The buds , that then were wreathed around my heart , Now breathe their hallowed sweetness there no more ; ‘ Twas thine to see them one by one depart , And yet thou shinest brightly as before . So , when this bosom , that ‘ mid all its woes Has longed thy little port of rest to win , In the calm grave shall find at last repose , Thou'lt beam as fair as though I ne'er had been .<date>1824</date>. E. P. K. RECOGNITION IN HEAVEN .</docImprint>
    <epigraph>
     <p>Oh ! say , shall those ties , now so sacred and dear , That with rainbow hues tint all our wanderings here , Be regarded no more in that heavenly sphere Whose portal 's the grave ? When , “ washed and forgiven , ” our spirits ascend To the home of the blest where all sorrowings end , O , will not a parent , a sister , a friend , Haste to welcome us there ? Shall we see no loved form we have gazed on before , To commune with of times that are faded and o'er ? Will the “ dear chosen few ” be remembered no more In that haven of bliss ? O my heart must believe , ‘ mid ethereal chimes A gloom would steal over my spirit sometimes , If the friends I have loved , in these heavenly climes , Seemed to know me no more . But hope fondly whispers it shall not be so ; Each purified spirit my bosom shall know , And all unremembered the ‘ plaining of woe , We 'll joy in the Lord .</p>
    </epigraph>
    <docImprint><date>1824</date>. E. P. K. WRITTEN IN L . J . ' S ALBUM . Gay visions for thee ‘ neath hope 's pencil have glowed , Peace dwells in thy bosom , a guileless abode ; Thou hast seen the bright side of existence alone , And believ'st every spirit as pure as thine own . May'st thou never awake from these rapturous dreams , To find that the world is not fair as it seems , To feel that the few thou hast loved have deceived , Have forsaken the heart that confided , believed , And left it as leafless , as bloomless , and waste As the rose-tree that 's stript by the merciless blast . When the warm sky of childhood was beaming for me , My days were all joyous , my heart was all glee ; Affection 's best ties round my bosom were spun ; No cloud dimmed the lustre of life 's morning sun . If I watched o'er my favorite rose-bud 's decay , And mourned that its bright tints were fading away , I knew not an anguish more poignant than this , And the morrow 's young brow wore a halo of bliss . May'st thou long be a novice to feelings like mine , When the shades of joy 's noonday proclaimed their decline , When death has doomed hearts warm as thine to decay , Or frigid estrangement has torn them away . Oh , I sometimes have questioned , when lingering near The home of the dead , of the friends who were dear , If the brightest enchantments of earth could repair The sad devastation that time has made there ; If the joys of the world had a balm to impart , That would act as a charm to the woes of the heart . Yes , there is such a balm , but it comes from above , It is wafted to earth on the pinions of love ; ‘ Tis the spirit of piety , spotless and pure , That teaches us calmly life 's ills to endure ; When it reigns in the heart , every error 's forgiven , It resigns us to earth , and prepares us for Heaven .<date>1825</date>. E. P. K. THE ALPINE HORN .</docImprint>
    <epigraph>
     <p>“ Just at the close of day the Alpine Horn is sounded from the highest mountain top , and mountain , rock and cave echo the solemn sound , ‘ Praised be the Lord . ’ ” When rainbow hues of closing day O'er evening 's portals faintly play , The Alpine horn calls far away , “ Praised be the Lord . ” And every hill and rock around , As though they loved the grateful sound , Send back , ‘ mid solitudes profound , “ Praised be the Lord . ” O God ! has man so thankless grown , He brings no anthems to thy throne , When voiceless things have found a tone To praise the Lord ? Ah no ! for , see , the shepherds come , Though hardly heard the welcome home ; From toil of day they quickly come To worship God . The look that taught their hearts to bow , And childhood 's laugh and sunny brow , All , all by them forgotten now In praise to God . Kneeling the starry vault beneath , With spirits free as air they breathe , Oh , pure should be their votive wreath Of praise to God . How glorious such a scene must be , When prayer and praise ascend to Thee In one glad voice of melody , Eternal Lord ! All space thy temple , and the air A viewless messenger , to bear Creation 's holy vesper prayer On wings to Heaven . Oh , that for me some Alpine horn , Both closing eve and wak'ning morn , Would sound , and bid my bosom scorn The world 's vain joys ; Its treasured idols all resign , That , when Life 's cheating hues decline , The one undying thought be mine , To praise the Lord !</p>
    </epigraph>
    <docImprint><date>1826</date>. E. P. K. THE GATHERING ROUND THE OAK TREE . [ Written in commemoration of the exclusion of Friends from their meeting-house at Abington . ] Why should “ the little remnant mourn ? ” Though closed the house of prayer , An aged oak its shelter gave ; And surely He was there , Who dwells in house not built with hands , Eternal in the skies ; Incense nor costly altar craves , Nor lamb for sacrifice ; But who the purest offering still Finds in a willing mind , And oft “ through paths they know not of , ” In safety leads the blind . Yes , He was there ! The faithful band , “ O'ershadowed by His love , ” Saw in each bough that gently waved A peace-branch from above . Jesus was in the awful pause ; The prayer He prompted too ; And softly sighed , “ Father , forgive , They know not what they do . ” While thus they crucify afresh The Lamb of Calvary , O Lord ! be merciful to them , Though they are false to Thee . And many a voiceless prayer was borne Up to the throne of God , That none might question Heaven 's decree , But bless the chastening rod ; That though our pathway thorny be , We fearless might pursue The track our fathers marked with blood , Unmurmuring marked it too . How freely may the little band Accept the chalice given , Till by the Saviour called to swell The symphonies of Heaven ; And when their weary pilgrimage , Their day on earth is done , God hath a coronal for those Who trusted in the Son .<date>1826</date>. E. P. K. J. H. ON THE DEATH OF HIS WIFE . Oh , when I found that Death had set His awful stamp on thee , Deserted on Life 's stormy shore , I thought that Time could have in store Not one more shaft for me . Long I had watched thy lingering bloom That brightened ‘ mid decay ; And then its eloquent appeal Would ask my heart if death could steal Such loveliness away . And oh ! could pure unsullied worth Or peerless beauty save , We had not stood as mourners here , And shed the unavailing tear O'er thy untimely grave . But we have seen thee lowly laid , And I am here alone ; Each morn I shuddering wake to feel The consciousness around me steal , That all my hopes are flown . All , did I say ? Ingrate indeed ! Oh , be the thought forgiven ; Has he not hopes and interests here , Whose sacred task it is to rear A family for Heaven ? Rebellious heart ! some tendril ties Around thee still are thrown ; Oh , while this cherub group is mine , Heaven 's dearest gift I can resign , And say , “ Thy will be done . ”</docImprint>
    <docDate><date>1826</date>. LINES , ON HEARING IT SAID “ THAT IT WAS UNREASONABLE TO SUPPOSE MAN SHOULD BELIEVE WHAT HE COULD NOT COMPREHEND . ” “ Thou great First Cause , ” Creator , King , and Lord , The worm that breathed at Thy commanding word , And dies whene'er Thou wilt , presumptuous man , Has dared the mazes of Thy path to scan ; Guided by reason 's powerless rays alone , Would pierce the veil of mystery round Thee thrown . Tell me , proud being !— flutterer of an hour — ( Who thus would comprehend creative power ) , Why worlds were made , why man was formed at all , Or crimeless once , permitted then to fall , The why , the wherefore , boots not us to know , Enough — that God ordained it to be so . Go thou , and cull the simplest flower that blows , The hillside daisy or the wilding rose , And tell me why so bright their hues appear , Why they return with each revolving year ; Or how , when countless worlds are all in bloom , O'er every bud is breathed its own perfume . Yes , solve me this , and I 'll believe with thee , ‘ Twas meant that man should doubt all mystery . Presumptuous worm ! enough to know is given — ‘ Tis fearful meddling with the things of Heaven ; Its sacred mysteries belong alone To Him whose paths are awful and unknown ; Who wings the storm , or whispers “ Peace , be still ; ” Cradling to rest the mountain wave at will ; Who for our souls his Son a ransom gave , And guards “ his fold ” from childhood to the grave . Confess , proud man , all his known ways are just , And what thou canst not fathom “ learn to trust . ”</docDate>
    <docImprint><date>1827</date>. E. P. K. IN A SEASON OF BEREAVEMENT . Bright summer comes , all bloom and flowers , To garland o'er her faded bowers ; There 's balm and sunshine on her wing , But where 's the friend she used to bring ? One heart is sad ‘ mid all the glee , And only asks , “ Oh , where is he ? ” He comes not now , he comes not now , To chase the gloom from off my brow , He comes not with his wonted smile The weary moments to beguile . There 's joy in every look I see , But mine is sad , for “ Where is he ? ” Closed is the book we used to read ; There 's none to smile , there 's none to heed ; Our ‘ customed walk 's deserted , too ; It charms not as it used to do ; The fav'rite path , the well-known tree , All , all are whispering , “ Where is he ? ” This faithful heart is now a shrine For each dear look and tone of thine , And every scene thou used to prize Forever hallowed in my eyes ; But oh ! how loved those friends shall be Whose tearful eyes say , “ Where is he ? ” I would not breathe to stranger 's ear A name so sacred and so clear , And , when the reckless crowd are nigh , My bosom checks the rising sigh ; But when no human eye can see . It bleeding cries , “ Ah , where is he ? ” Oh , how I miss thy smile of light , “ Welcome ” at morn and kind “ good night ! ” But , when the quiet eve comes on , I feel that thou indeed art gone . That herald of delight to me Is joyless now , for “ Where is he ? ” I have not seen the crimson dye , Which sunset gives the western sky , Since on thy couch of death thou lay And watched its glories fade away . Those hues , so oft admired with thee , Would ask too loudly , “ Where is he ? ” And oh ! that orb , on whose mild rays So fondly , too , we used to gaze , And , though far distant , there unite At the same sacred hour of night , Seems sadly now to whisper me , “ Thou art all alone ,— where , where is he ? ” Life was to us no cloudless day , Blossom and blight still marked our way ; But sorrow is not skilled to part , It links more closely heart to heart . Yes ! and they ever linked shall be — “ Summer , oh ! tell me , where is he ? ” I hear a voice upon the breeze , It speaks of holier ties than these ; Of worlds , where farewell sounds are o'er , And Death a victor never more . It bids me for that clime prepare , And sweetly whispers , “ He is there . ”<date>1828</date>. E. P. K. ON A PACKET OF LETTERS . “ To-day ” — Oh ! not to-day shall sound Thy mild and gentle voice ; Nor yet “ to-morrow ” will it bid My heart rejoice . But one , one fondly treasured thing Is left me ‘ mid decay , This record , hallowed with thy thoughts Of yesterday . Chaste thoughts and holy , such as still To purest hearts are given , Breathing of Earth , yet wafting high The soul to Heaven ; Soaring beyond the bounds of Time , Beyond the blight of Death , To worlds where “ parting is no more , ” “ Nor Life a breath . ” ‘ Tis true they whisper mournfully Of buds too bright to bloom , Of hopes that blossomed but to die Around the tomb . Still they are sweet remembrances Of life 's unclouded day — Sketches of mind , which death alone Can wrench away ; Memorials sad of by-past hours , Gone with the silent dead ; Pictured affections , pencilled dreams . Forever fled ! Forever ? Are they hushed indeed To wake again no more ? Ties dearer far than Life itself With life all o'er ? No !

Thou art come from the spirits ’ land , thou bird ! Thou art come from the spirits ’ land : Through the dark pine grove let thy voice be heard , And tell of the shadowy band !

     <p>F. HEMANS . Yes ! yes , I have come from the spirits ’ land , From the land that is bright and fair , I come with a voice from the shadowy band , To tell that they love you there ! To say , if a wish or a fond regret Could live in Elysian bowers , ‘ Twould be for the friends they could ne'er forget , The loved of their youthful hours ; To whisper the dear deserted band , Who smiled on their tarriance here , That a faithful guard in the dreamless land Are the friends they have loved so dear . They have gone to be seen of men no more ; But oft on a shadowy hill , Or the crest of a wave where the moonbeams pour , They are watching around you still . And oft on a fleecy cloud they sail , And oft on the hurrying blast , When slumber her light and magic veil O'er man and his woes has cast . ‘ Tis true , in the silent night you call , And they answer you not again — For the spirits of bliss are voiceless all ; Sound only was made for pain . That their land is bright and they weep no more , I have warbled from hill to hill , But my plaintive strains should have told before , They love , oh ! they love you still . They bid me say that unfading flowers You 'll find in the path they trod , And a welcome true to their deathless bowers Pronounced by the voice of God . HEAVEN AND EARTH . Turn from the grave , turn from the grave , There 's fearful mystery there ; Descend not to the shadowy tomb , If thou wouldst shun despair . It tells a tale of severed ties To break the bleeding heart , And from the “ canopy of dust ” Would make it death to part . Oh ! lift the eye of faith to worlds Where death shall never come , And there behold “ the pure in heart ” Whom God has gathered home , Beyond the changing things of time , Beyond the reach of care . How sweet to view the ransomed ones In dazzling glory there ! They seem to whisper to the loved Who smoothed their path below , “ Weep not for us , our tears have all Forever ceased to flow . ” Take from the grave , take from the grave , Those bright , but withering ; flowers , The spirit that had loved them once Is now in fadeless bowers ; Undying is the fragrance there , Eternal is the bloom ; But the next breeze may waft away This perishing perfume . One fearful stamp , “ Doomed to decay , ” Marks all the joys of earth ; Oh ! what a resting-place for souls Of an immortal birth ! Then linger round the grave no more , Lift , lift the eye to Heaven , Till hues of faith shall gild the gloom , And every sigh 's forgiven . Then , when the golden harvest 's done , The path of duty trod , Thou with the loved may'st garnered be , And gathered home to God .</p>

     <p>“ And the laughter of the young and gay Was far too glad and loud . ” Hush , hush ! my thoughts are resting on a changeless world of bliss ; Oh ! come not with the voice of mirth to lure them back to this . ‘ Tis true , we 've much of sadness in our weary sojourn here , That fades , and leaves no deeper trace than childhood 's reckless tear ; But there are woes which scathe the heart till all its bloom is o'er , A deadly blight we feel but once , that once for evermore . Oh , then , ‘ tis sweet on fancy 's wing to cleave that bright domain ! The loved and the redeemed are there , why lure me back again ? The cadences of gladness to your hearts may yet be dear ; They have no melody for mine , all , all is desert here . The sunshine still is bright to you , the moonlight and the flowers ; To me they tell a harrowing tale of dear departed hours . I would not cull Hope 's blossoms now , they seem of deadly bloom ; And can I love the sunshine , when it smiles upon the tomb ? When on one little hallowed spot its joyous beams are thrown , That sacred turf — the all of earth — I now may call my own . For there my joys are sepulchred , my hopes are buried there ; Yet with that holy earth are linked high thoughts that mock despair ; Unfaltering faith , that whispers of a purer world than this , Where spirits that are parted here may “ mingle into bliss ; ” “ Deep trust ” that all our sinless hopes , which death forbids to bloom , Shall ripen ‘ neath the cloudless sky that dawns beyond the tomb ; Conviction firm that things of time were never yet designed To quench the vast and deathless thirst of an immortal mind . Then hush ! my thoughts are resting on a changeless world of bliss ; There is no voice of gladness now can lure them back to this . I look to Thee , Redeemer ! Oh ! be every crime forgiven , And take the weary captive to Thy paradise in Heaven ; Or teach my heart resignedly to say , “ Thy will be done , ” And calmly wait thy summons home , thou just and holy One ! Thou mayst have spoiled my cherished schemes , to let my spirit see That happiness is only found , great God , in serving Thee .</p>

    <docImprint><date>1828</date>. E. P. K. CONSOLATION IN BEREAVEMENT . ‘ Tis not when we look on the dreamless dead , And feel that the spirit forever has fled ; ‘ Tis not when we 're called to the voiceless tomb By the loved who were culled in their brightest bloom ; ‘ Tis not when the grave 's last rite is o'er , And we know they are gone to return no more ; But , oh ! ‘ tis when Time with oblivious wing A balm to all other hearts may bring ; When the dark , dark hours of grief are o'er , And we join the world we can love no more ,— That world whose grief for the absent one Passed like a cloud from an April sun ; When , amid the mirth that salutes the ear , One tone is gone we had used to hear , One form is missed in that happy train , That will never exult in its sports again ; We feel that death has indeed passed o'er , And a blank is left , to be filled no more . But though the world and its witching smile , That cheats the heart of its woes awhile , Would prove in its time of deepest need But the frail support of a broken reed , Religion 's beam has the magic power To chase the cloud from its darkest hour , To turn the soul from its idols here , And fix its hopes on a purer sphere ; Then land it safe in a port of rest , The haven sure of a Saviour 's breast .<date>1828</date>.

       <l n="1">They have left their homes and kindred , they are in the strangers ’ land ,</l>
       <l n="2">The voice of God revealed his will ; His will was their command .</l>
       <l n="3">They crossed the pathless main , nor feared the sadly treacherous wave ,</l>
       <l n="4">For is not He in whom they trust omnipotent to save ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">But did no dark forebodings come ? Was all at peace within ?</l>
       <l n="6">Did prompt obedience ’ sure reward e'en with the toil begin ?</l>
       <l n="7">Ah no ! for nature 's fond appeal would in that hour be heard ;</l>
       <l n="8">Maternity 's deep spring of love within the heart was stirred .</l>
       <l n="9">Perhaps some little cherub form , that it was joy to see ,</l>
       <l n="10">Would climb no more , with sunny smile , its happy parent 's knee ;</l>
       <l n="11">Perhaps some gentle household voice , that sighed “ farewell ” with pain ,</l>
       <l n="12">Might never welcome their return to that loved home again ;</l>
       <l n="13">Then came the thought of glistening eyes , which long had done with tears ,</l>
       <l n="14">Eyes that had kept an anxious watch o'er childhood 's reckless years ;</l>
       <l n="15">While mem'ry dwelt upon that last and earnest gaze of love ,</l>
       <l n="16">Which shows the heart withholds its seal from what the lips approve .</l>
       <l n="17">They feared those silvery locks , that told ‘ twas almost “ close of day , ”</l>
       <l n="18">Would to the grave go down , and they , their children , far away !</l>
       <l n="19">A moment nature shrank — the thought was too , too full of pain —</l>
       <l n="20">But ah ! their Master 's strength was made in weakness perfect then ;</l>
       <l n="21">The voice that lulls the billowy deep soon bade the storm be still ,</l>
       <l n="22">Bade them rejoice that they were called to do his perfect will ;</l>
       <l n="23">To execute with fearless trust the holy high command ,—</l>
       <l n="24">“ Go , and glad gospel tidings spread , over a distant land ,</l>
       <l n="25">And beams of heavenly peace around your guarded path shall play ,</l>
       <l n="26">Peace that the world can never give , nor ever take away . ”</l>
       <l n="27">But has the fearful sacrifice at last been made in vain ?</l>
       <l n="28">And shall no trace within our hearts , no deathless trace remain ?</l>
       <l n="29">Bright record , that with us awhile their dwelling place has been ,</l>
       <l n="30">Preparing temples for their Lord 's high service to begin .</l>
       <l n="31">Oh yes , I trust , a fount of light and life they have unsealed</l>
       <l n="32">To many a thirsting , fainting soul , a Saviour 's love revealed ;</l>
       <l n="33">Have taught “ that in his service there is perfect freedom ” still ,</l>
       <l n="34">That ‘ tis the highest bliss of Heaven to do his sovereign will ,</l>
       <l n="35">And if a humble suppliant may bow before Thy throne ,</l>
       <l n="36">My Father ! and a blessing ask on hearts to her unknown ,</l>
       <l n="37">Oh ! grant for them “ the lines may fall in pleasant places ” here ,</l>
       <l n="38">“ Beside still waters ” bid them rest , and feel that Thou art near .</l>
       <l n="39">Thou hast Thyself declared , that great their recompense shall be ,</l>
       <l n="40">Who have “ forsaken all ” to love and follow only Thee ;</l>
       <l n="41">And they have left the “ near and dear , ” the parent , child , and friend ;</l>
       <l n="42">Then in Thy holy name may all these sweet affections blend !</l>
       <l n="43">And should the world desert them , Lord , oh , be the world to them ,</l>
       <l n="44">The song of their rejoicing here , in Heaven the crowning gem ;</l>
       <l n="45">Thy sacred guidance grant , I pray , o'er life 's tempestuous sea ,</l>
       <l n="46">Awhile a gentle course , and then ,— a sheltering port in Thee .</l>
