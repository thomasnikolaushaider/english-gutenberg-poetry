     <p>A WINTER IDYL . TO THE MEMORY OF THE HOUSEHOLD IT DESCRIBES , THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR . The inmates of the family at the Whittier homestead who are referred to in the poem were my father , mother , my brother and two sisters , and my uncle and aunt both unmarried . In addition , there was the district school-master who boarded with us . The “ not unfeared , half-welcome guest ” was Harriet Livermore , daughter of Judge Livermore , of New Hampshire , a young woman of fine natural ability , enthusiastic , eccentric , with slight control over her violent temper , which sometimes made her religious profession doubtful . She was equally ready to exhort in school-house prayer-meetings and dance in a Washington ball-room , while her father was a member of Congress . She early embraced the doctrine of the Second Advent , and felt it her duty to proclaim the Lord 's speedy coming . With this message she crossed the Atlantic and spent the greater part of a long life in travelling over Europe and Asia . She lived some time with Lady Hester Stanhope , a woman as fantastic and mentally strained as herself , on the slope of Mt . Lebanon , but finally quarrelled with her in regard to two white horses with red marks on their backs which suggested the idea of saddles , on which her titled hostess expected to ride into Jerusalem with the Lord . A friend of mine found her , when quite an old woman , wandering in Syria with a tribe of Arabs , who with the Oriental notion that madness is inspiration , accepted her as their prophetess and leader . At the time referred to in Snow-Bound she was boarding at the Rocks Village about two miles from us .</p>

    <docImprint>In my boyhood , in our lonely farm-house , we had scanty sources of information ; few books and only a small weekly newspaper . Our only annual was the Almanac . Under such circumstances story-telling was a necessary resource in the long winter evenings . My father when a young man had traversed the wilderness to<country>Canada</country>, and could tell us of his adventures with Indians and wild beasts , and of his sojourn in the French villages . My uncle was ready with his record of hunting and fishing and , it must be confessed , with stories which he at least half believed , of witchcraft and apparitions . My mother , who was born in the Indian-haunted region of Somersworth , New Hampshire , between Dover and Portsmouth , told us of the inroads of the savages , and the narrow escape of her ancestors . She described strange people who lived on the Piscataqua and Cocheco , among whom was Bantam the sorcerer . I have in my possession the wizard 's “ conjuring book , ” which he solemnly opened when consulted . It is a copy of Cornelius Agrippa 's Magic printed in<date>1651</date>, dedicated to Dr. Robert Child , who , like Michael Scott , had learned “ the art of glammorie In Padua beyond the sea , ” and who is famous in the annals of Massachusetts , where he was at one time a resident , as the first man who dared petition the General Court for liberty of conscience . The full title of the book is Three Books of Occult Philosophy , by Henry Cornelius Agrippa , Knight , Doctor of both Laws , Counsellor to Caesar 's Sacred Majesty and Judge of the Prerogative Court . “ As the Spirits of Darkness be stronger in the dark , so Good Spirits , which be Angels of Light , are augmented not only by the Divine light of the Sun , but also by our common Wood Fire : and as the Celestial Fire drives away dark spirits , so also this our Fire of Wood doth the same . ” — Cor . AGRIPPA , Occult Philosophy , Book I. ch . v .</docImprint>

     <p>“ Announced by all the trumpets of the sky , Arrives the snow , and , driving o'er the fields , Seems nowhere to alight : the whited air Hides hills and woods , the rivet and the heaven , And veils the farm-house at the garden 's end . The sled and traveller stopped , the courier 's feet Delayed , all friends shut out , the housemates sit Around the radiant fireplace , enclosed In a tumultuous privacy of storm . ” Emerson . The Snow Storm . The sun that brief December day Rose cheerless over hills of gray , And , darkly circled , gave at noon A sadder light than waning moon . Slow tracing down the thickening sky Its mute and ominous prophecy , A portent seeming less than threat , It sank from sight before it set . A chill no coat , however stout , Of homespun stuff could quite , shut out , A hard , dull bitterness of cold , That checked , mid-vein , the circling race Of life-blood in the sharpened face , The coming of the snow-storm told . The wind blew east ; we heard the roar Of Ocean on his wintry shore , And felt the strong pulse throbbing there Beat with low rhythm our inland air . Meanwhile we did our nightly chores ,— Brought in the wood from out of doors , Littered the stalls , and from the mows Raked down the herd'shYpppHeNgrass for the cows Heard the horse whinnying for his corn ; And , sharply clashing horn on horn , Impatient down the stanchion rows The cattle shake their walnut bows ; While , peering from his early perch Upon the scaffold 's pole of birch , The cock his crested helmet bent And down his querulous challenge sent . Unwarmed by any sunset light The gray day darkened into night , A night made hoary with the swarm , And whirl-dance of the blinding storm , As zigzag , wavering to and fro , Crossed and recrossed the winged snow And ere the early bedtime came The white drift piled the window-frame , And through the glass the clothes-line posts Looked in like tall and sheeted ghosts . So all night long the storm roared on The morning broke without a sun ; In tiny spherule traced with lines Of Nature 's geometric signs , In starry flake , and pellicle , All day the hoary meteor fell ; And , when the second morning shone , We looked upon a world unknown , On nothing we could call our own . Around the glistening wonder bent The blue walls of the firmament , No cloud above , no earth below ,— A universe of sky and snow The old familiar sights of ours Took marvellous shapes ; strange domes and towers Rose up where sty or corn-crib stood , Or garden-wall , or belt of wood ; A smooth white mound the brush-pile showed , A fenceless drift what once was road ; The bridle-post an old man sat With loose-flung coat and high cocked hat ; The well-curb had a Chinese roof ; And even the long sweep , high aloof , In its slant splendor , seemed to tell Of Pisa 's leaning miracle . A prompt , decisive man , no breath Our father wasted : “ Boys , a path ! ” Well pleased , ( for when did farmer boy Count such a summons less than joy ? ) Our buskins on our feet we drew ; With mittened hands , and caps drawn low , To guard our necks and ears from snow , We cut the solid whiteness through . And , where the drift was deepest , made A tunnel walled and overlaid With dazzling crystal : we had read Of rare Aladdin 's wondrous cave , And to our own his name we gave , With many a wish the luck were ours To test his lamp 's supernal powers . We reached the barn with merry din , And roused the prisoned brutes within . The old horse thrust his long head out , And grave with wonder gazed about ; The cock his lusty greeting said , And forth his speckled harem led ; The oxen lashed their tails , and hooked , And mild reproach of hunger looked ; The horned patriarch of the sheep , Like Egypt 's Amun roused from sleep , Shook his sage head with gesture mute , And emphasized with stamp of foot .</p>

    <docTitle><titlePart>All day the gusty north-wind bore The loosening drift its breath before ; Low circling round its southern zone , The sun through dazzling snow-mist shone . No church-bell lent its Christian tone To the savage air , no social smoke Curled over woods of snow-hung oak . A solitude made more intense By dreary-voiced elements , The shrieking of the mindless wind , The moaning tree-boughs swaying blind , And on the glass the unmeaning beat Of ghostly finger-tips of sleet . Beyond the circle of our hearth No welcome sound of toil or mirth Unbound the spell , and testified Of human life and thought outside . We minded that the sharpest ear The buried brooklet could not hear , The music of whose liquid lip Had been to us companionship , And , in our lonely life , had grown To have an almost human tone . As night drew on , and , from the crest Of wooded knolls that ridged the west , The sun , a snow-blown traveller , sank From sight beneath the smothering bank , We piled , with care , our nightly stack Of wood against the chimney-back ,— The oaken log , green , huge , and thick , And on its top the stout back-stick ; The knotty forestick laid apart , And filled between with curious art The ragged brush ; then , hovering near , We watched the first red blaze appear , Heard the sharp crackle , caught the gleam On whitewashed wall and sagging beam , Until the old , rude-furnished room Burst , flower-like , into rosy bloom ; While radiant with a mimic flame Outside the sparkling drift became , And through the bare-boughed lilac-tree Our own warm hearth seemed blazing free . The crane and pendent trammels showed , The Turks ’ heads on the andirons glowed ; While childish fancy , prompt to tell The meaning of the miracle , Whispered the old rhyme : “ Under the tree , When fire outdoors burns merrily , There the witches are making tea . ” The moon above the eastern wood Shone at its full ; the hill-range stood Transfigured in the silver flood , Its blown snows flashing cold and keen , Dead white , save where some sharp ravine Took shadow , or the sombre green Of hemlocks turned to pitchy black Against the whiteness at their back . For such a world and such a night Most fitting that unwarming light , Which only seemed where'er it fell To make the coldness visible . Shut in from all the world without , We sat the clean-winged hearth about , Content to let the north-wind roar In baffled rage at pane and door , While the red logs before us beat The frost-line back with tropic heat ; And ever , when a louder blast Shook beam and rafter as it passed , The merrier up its roaring draught The great throat of the chimney laughed ; The house-dog on his paws outspread Laid to the fire his drowsy head , The cat 's dark silhouette on the wall A couchant tiger 's seemed to fall ; And , for the winter fireside meet , Between the andirons ’ straddling feet , The mug of cider simmered slow , The apples sputtered in a row , And , close at hand , the basket stood With nuts from brown October 's wood . What matter how the night behaved ? What matter how the north-wind raved ? Blow high , blow low , not all its snow Could quench our hearth-fire 's ruddy glow . O Time and Change !— with hair as gray As was my sire 's that winter day , How strange it seems , with so much gone Of life and love , to still live on ! Ah , brother ! only I and thou Are left of all that circle now ,— The dear home faces whereupon That fitful firelight paled and shone . Henceforward , listen as we will , The voices of that hearth are still ; Look where we may , the wide earth o'er Those lighted faces smile no more . We tread the paths their feet have worn , We sit beneath their orchard trees , We hear , like them , the hum of bees And rustle of the bladed corn ; We turn the pages that they read , Their written words we linger o'er , But in the sun they cast no shade , No voice is heard , no sign is made , No step is on the conscious floor ! Yet Love will dream , and Faith will trust , ( Since He who knows our need is just ,) That somehow , somewhere , meet we must . Alas for him who never sees The stars shine through his cypress-trees Who , hopeless , lays his dead away , Nor looks to see the breaking day Across the mournful marbles play ! Who hath not learned , in hours of faith , The truth to flesh and sense unknown , That Life is ever lord of Death , And Love can never lose its own ! We sped the time with stories old , Wrought puzzles out , and riddles told , Or stammered from our school-book lore The Chief of Gambia 's “ golden shore . ” How often since , when all the land Was clay in Slavery 's shaping hand , As if a far-blown trumpet stirred The languorous sin-sick air , I heard “ Does not the voice of reason cry , Claim the first right which Nature gave , From the red scourge of bondage fly , Nor deign to live a burdened slave ! ” Our father rode again his ride On Memphremagog 's wooded side ; Sat down again to moose and samp In trapper 's hut and Indian camp ; Lived o'er the old idyllic ease Beneath St. Francois ’ hemlock-trees ; Again for him the moonlight shone On Norman cap and bodiced zone ; Again he heard the violin play Which led the village dance away , And mingled in its merry whirl The grandam and the laughing girl . Or , nearer home , our steps he led Where Salisbury 's level marshes spread Mile-wide as flies the laden bee ; Where merry mowers , hale and strong , Swept , scythe on scythe , their swaths along The low green prairies of the sea . We shared the fishing off Boar 's Head , And round the rocky Isles of Shoals The hake-broil on the drift-wood coals ; The chowder on the sand-beach made , Dipped by the hungry , steaming hot , With spoons of clam-shell from the pot . We heard the tales of witchcraft old , And dream and sign and marvel told To sleepy listeners as they lay Stretched idly on the salted hay , Adrift along the winding shores , When favoring breezes deigned to blow The square sail of the gundelow And idle lay the useless oars . Our mother , while she turned her wheel Or run the new-knit stocking-heel , Told how the Indian hordes came down At midnight on Cocheco town , And how her own great-uncle bore His cruel scalp-mark to fourscore . Recalling , in her fitting phrase , So rich and picturesque and free , ( The common unrhymed poetry Of simple life and country ways ,) The story of her early days ,— She made us welcome to her home ; Old hearths grew wide to give us room ; We stole with her a frightened look At the gray wizard 's conjuring-book , The fame whereof went far and wide Through all the simple country side ; We heard the hawks at twilight play , The boat-horn on Piscataqua , The loon 's weird laughter far away ; We fished her little trout-brook , knew What flowers in wood and meadow grew , What sunny hillsides autumn-brown She climbed to shake the ripe nuts down , Saw where in sheltered cove and bay The ducks ’ black squadron anchored lay , And heard the wild-geese calling loud Beneath the gray November cloud . Then , haply , with a look more grave , And soberer tone , some tale she gave From painful Sewell 's ancient tome , Beloved in every Quaker home , Of faith fire-winged by martyrdom , Or Chalkley 's Journal , old and quaint ,— Gentlest of skippers , rare sea-saint !— Who , when the dreary calms prevailed , And water-butt and bread-cask failed , And cruel , hungry eyes pursued His portly presence mad for food , With dark hints muttered under breath Of casting lots for life or death , Offered , if Heaven withheld supplies , To be himself the sacrifice . Then , suddenly , as if to save The good man from his living grave , A ripple on the water grew , A school of porpoise flashed in view . “ Take , eat , ” he said , “ and be content ; These fishes in my stead are sent By Him who gave the tangled ram To spare the child of Abraham . ” Our uncle , innocent of books , Was rich in lore of fields and brooks , The ancient teachers never dumb Of Nature 's unhoused lyceum . In moons and tides and weather wise , He read the clouds as prophecies , And foul or fair could well divine , By many an occult hint and sign , Holding the cunning-warded keys To all the woodcraft mysteries ; Himself to Nature 's heart so near That all her voices in his ear Of beast or bird had meanings clear , Like Apollonius of old , Who knew the tales the sparrows told , Or Hermes who interpreted What the sage cranes of Nilus said ;</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>Content to live where life began ; A simple , guileless , childlike man , Strong only on his native grounds , The little world of sights and sounds Whose girdle was the parish bounds , Whereof his fondly partial pride The common features magnified , As Surrey hills to mountains grew In White of Selborne 's loving view ,— He told how teal and loon he shot , And how the eagle 's eggs he got , The feats on pond and river done , The prodigies of rod and gun ; Till , warming with the tales he told , Forgotten was the outside cold , The bitter wind unheeded blew , From ripening corn the pigeons flew , The partridge drummed I ’ the wood , the mink Went fishing down the river-brink . In fields with bean or clover gay , The woodchuck , like a hermit gray , Peered from the doorway of his cell ; The muskrat plied the mason 's trade , And tier by tier his mud-walls laid ; And from the shagbark overhead The grizzled squirrel dropped his shell . Next , the dear aunt , whose smile of cheer And voice in dreams I see and hear ,— The sweetest woman ever Fate Perverse denied a household mate , Who , lonely , homeless , not the less Found peace in love 's unselfishness , And welcome wheresoe'er she went , A calm and gracious element ,— Whose presence seemed the sweet income And womanly atmosphere of home ,— Called up her girlhood memories , The huskings and the apple-bees , The sleigh-rides and the summer sails , Weaving through all the poor details And homespun warp of circumstance A golden woof-thread of romance . For well she kept her genial mood And simple faith of maidenhood ; Before her still a cloud-land lay , The mirage loomed across her way ; The morning dew , that dries so soon With others , glistened at her noon ; Through years of toil and soil and care , From glossy tress to thin gray hair , All unprofaned she held apart The virgin fancies of the heart . Be shame to him of woman born Who hath for such but thought of scorn . There , too , our elder sister plied Her evening task the stand beside ; A full , rich nature , free to trust , Truthful and almost sternly just , Impulsive , earnest , prompt to act , And make her generous thought a fact , Keeping with many a light disguise The secret of self-sacrifice . O heart sore-tried ! thou hast the best That Heaven itself could give thee ,— rest , Rest from all bitter thoughts and things ! How many a poor one 's blessing went With thee beneath the low green tent Whose curtain never outward swings ! As one who held herself a part Of all she saw , and let her heart Against the household bosom lean , Upon the motley-braided mat Our youngest and our dearest sat , Lifting her large , sweet , asking eyes , Now bathed in the unfading green And holy peace of Paradise . Oh , looking from some heavenly hill , Or from the shade of saintly palms , Or silver reach of river calms , Do those large eyes behold me still ? With me one little year ago :— The chill weight of the winter snow For months upon her grave has lain ; And now , when summer south-winds blow And brier and harebell bloom again , I tread the pleasant paths we trod , I see the violet-sprinkled sod Whereon she leaned , too frail and weak The hillside flowers she loved to seek , Yet following me where'er I went With dark eyes full of love 's content . The birds are glad ; the brier-rose fills The air with sweetness ; all the hills Stretch green to June 's unclouded sky ; But still I wait with ear and eye For something gone which should be nigh , A loss in all familiar things , In flower that blooms , and bird that sings . And yet , dear heart ’ remembering thee , Am I not richer than of old ? Safe in thy immortality , What change can reach the wealth I hold ? What chance can mar the pearl and gold Thy love hath left in trust with me ? And while in life 's late afternoon , Where cool and long the shadows grow , I walk to meet the night that soon Shall shape and shadow overflow , I cannot feel that thou art far , Since near at need the angels are ; And when the sunset gates unbar , Shall I not see thee waiting stand , And , white against the evening star , The welcome of thy beckoning hand ?</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Brisk wielder of the birch and rule , The master of the district school Held at the fire his favored place , Its warm glow lit a laughing face Fresh-hued and fair , where scarce appeared The uncertain prophecy of beard . He teased the mitten-blinded cat , Played cross-pins on my uncle 's hat , Sang songs , and told us what befalls In classic Dartmouth 's college halls . Born the wild Northern hills among , From whence his yeoman father wrung By patient toil subsistence scant , Not competence and yet not want , He early gained the power to pay His cheerful , self-reliant way ; Could doff at ease his scholar 's gown To peddle wares from town to town ; Or through the long vacation 's reach In lonely lowland districts teach , Where all the droll experience found At stranger hearths in boarding round , The moonlit skater 's keen delight , The sleigh-drive through the frosty night , The rustic party , with its rough Accompaniment of blind-man'shYpppHeNbuff , And whirling plate , and forfeits paid , His winter task a pastime made . Happy the snow-locked homes wherein He tuned his merry violin , Or played the athlete in the barn , Or held the good dame 's winding-yarn , Or mirth-provoking versions told Of classic legends rare and old , Wherein the scenes of Greece and Rome Had all the commonplace of home , And little seemed at best the odds ‘ Twixt Yankee pedlers and old gods ; Where Pindus-born Arachthus took The guise of any grist-mill brook , And dread Olympus at his will Became a huckleberry hill . A careless boy that night be seemed ; But at his desk he had the look And air of one who wisely schemed , And hostage from the future took In trained thought and lore of book . Large-brained , clear-eyed , of such as he Shall Freedom 's young apostles be , Who , following in War 's bloody trail , Shall every lingering wrong assail ; All chains from limb and spirit strike , Uplift the black and white alike ; Scatter before their swift advance The darkness and the ignorance , The pride , the lust , the squalid sloth , Which nurtured Treason 's monstrous growth , Made murder pastime , and the hell Of prison-torture possible ; The cruel lie of caste refute , Old forms remould , and substitute For Slavery 's lash the freeman 's will , For blind routine , wise-handed skill ; A school-house plant on every hill , Stretching in radiate nerve-lines thence The quick wires of intelligence ; Till North and South together brought Shall own the same electric thought , In peace a common flag salute , And , side by side in labor 's free And unresentful rivalry , Harvest the fields wherein they fought . Another guest that winter night Flashed back from lustrous eyes the light . Unmarked by time , and yet not young , The honeyed music of her tongue And words of meekness scarcely told A nature passionate and bold , Strong , self-concentred , spurning guide , Its milder features dwarfed beside Her unbent will 's majestic pride . She sat among us , at the best , A not unfeared , half-welcome guest , Rebuking with her cultured phrase Our homeliness of words and ways . A certain pard-like , treacherous grace Swayed the lithe limbs and dropped the lash , Lent the white teeth their dazzling flash ; And under low brows , black with night , Rayed out at times a dangerous light ; The sharp heat-lightnings of her face Presaging ill to him whom Fate Condemned to share her love or hate . A woman tropical , intense In thought and act , in soul and sense , She blended in a like degree The vixen and the devotee , Revealing with each freak or feint The temper of Petruchio 's Kate , The raptures of Siena 's saint . Her tapering hand and rounded wrist Had facile power to form a fist ; The warm , dark languish of her eyes Was never safe from wrath 's surprise . Brows saintly calm and lips devout Knew every change of scowl and pout ; And the sweet voice had notes more high And shrill for social battle-cry . Since then what old cathedral town Has missed her pilgrim staff and gown , What convent-gate has held its lock Against the challenge of her knock ! Through Smyrna 's plague-hushed thoroughfares , Up sea-set Malta 's rocky stairs , Gray olive slopes of hills that hem Thy tombs and shrines , Jerusalem , Or startling on her desert throne The crazy Queen of Lebanon s With claims fantastic as her own , Her tireless feet have held their way ; And still , unrestful , bowed , and gray , She watches under Eastern skies , With hope each day renewed and fresh , The Lord 's quick coming in the flesh , Whereof she dreams and prophesies ! Where'er her troubled path may be , The Lord 's sweet pity with her go ! The outward wayward life we see , The hidden springs we may not know . Nor is it given us to discern What threads the fatal sisters spun , Through what ancestral years has run The sorrow with the woman born , What forged her cruel chain of moods , What set her feet in solitudes , And held the love within her mute , What mingled madness in the blood , A life-long discord and annoy , Water of tears with oil of joy , And hid within the folded bud Perversities of flower and fruit . It is not ours to separate The tangled skein of will and fate , To show what metes and bounds should stand Upon the soul 's debatable land , And between choice and Providence Divide the circle of events ; But lie who knows our frame is just , Merciful and compassionate , And full of sweet assurances And hope for all the language is , That He remembereth we are dust ! At last the great logs , crumbling low , Sent out a dull and duller glow , The bull'shYpppHeNeye watch that hung in view , Ticking its weary circuit through , Pointed with mutely warning sign Its black hand to the hour of nine . That sign the pleasant circle broke My uncle ceased his pipe to smoke , Knocked from its bowl the refuse gray , And laid it tenderly away , Then roused himself to safely cover The dull red brands with ashes over . And while , with care , our mother laid The work aside , her steps she stayed One moment , seeking to express Her grateful sense of happiness For food and shelter , warmth and health , And love 's contentment more than wealth , With simple wishes ( not the weak , Vain prayers which no fulfilment seek , But such as warm the generous heart , O'erhYpppHeNprompt to do with Heaven its part ) That none might lack , that bitter night , For bread and clothing , warmth and light . Within our beds awhile we heard The wind that round the gables roared , With now and then a ruder shock , Which made our very bedsteads rock . We heard the loosened clapboards tost , The board-nails snapping in the frost ; And on us , through the unplastered wall , Felt the light sifted snow-flakes fall . But sleep stole on , as sleep will do When hearts are light and life is new ; Faint and more faint the murmurs grew , Till in the summer-land of dreams They softened to the sound of streams , Low stir of leaves , and dip of oars , And lapsing waves on quiet shores . Next morn we wakened with the shout Of merry voices high and clear ; And saw the teamsters drawing near To break the drifted highways out . Down the long hillside treading slow We saw the half-buried oxen ’ go , Shaking the snow from heads uptost , Their straining nostrils white with frost . Before our door the straggling train Drew up , an added team to gain . The elders threshed their hands a-cold , Passed , with the cider-mug , their jokes From lip to lip ; the younger folks Down the loose snow-banks , wrestling , rolled , Then toiled again the cavalcade O'er windy hill , through clogged ravine , And woodland paths that wound between Low drooping pine-boughs winter-weighed . From every barn a team afoot , At every house a new recruit , Where , drawn by Nature 's subtlest law Haply the watchful young men saw Sweet doorway pictures of the curls And curious eyes of merry girls , Lifting their hands in mock defence Against the snow-ball 's compliments , And reading in each missive tost The charm with Eden never lost . We heard once more the sleigh-bells ’ sound ; And , following where the teamsters led , The wise old Doctor went his round , Just pausing at our door to say , In the brief autocratic way Of one who , prompt at Duty 's call , Was free to urge her claim on all , That some poor neighbor sick abed At night our mother 's aid would need . For , one in generous thought and deed , What mattered in the sufferer 's sight The Quaker matron 's inward light , The Doctor 's mail of Calvin 's creed ? All hearts confess the saints elect Who , twain in faith , in love agree , And melt not in an acid sect The Christian pearl of charity ! So days went on : a week had passed Since the great world was heard from last . The Almanac we studied o'er , Read and reread our little store , Of books and pamphlets , scarce a score ; One harmless novel , mostly hid From younger eyes , a book forbid , And poetry , ( or good or bad , A single book was all we had ,) Where Ellwood 's meek , drab-skirted Muse , A stranger to the heathen Nine , Sang , with a somewhat nasal whine , The wars of David and the Jews . At last the floundering carrier bore The village paper to our door . Lo ! broadening outward as we read , To warmer zones the horizon spread ; In panoramic length unrolled We saw the marvels that it told . Before us passed the painted Creeks , And daft McGregor on his raids In Costa Rica 's everglades . And up Taygetos winding slow Rode Ypsilanti 's Mainote Greeks , A Turk 's head at each saddle-bow Welcome to us its week-old news , Its corner for the rustic Muse , Its monthly gauge of snow and rain , Its record , mingling in a breath The wedding bell and dirge of death ; Jest , anecdote , and love-lorn tale , The latest culprit sent to jail ; Its hue and cry of stolen and lost , Its vendue sales and goods at cost , And traffic calling loud for gain . We felt the stir of hall and street , The pulse of life that round us beat ; The chill embargo of the snow Was melted in the genial glow ; Wide swung again our ice-locked door , And all the world was ours once more ! Clasp , Angel of the backward look And folded wings of ashen gray And voice of echoes far away , The brazen covers of thy book ; The weird palimpsest old and vast , Wherein thou hid'st the spectral past ; Where , closely mingling , pale and glow The characters of joy and woe ; The monographs of outlived years , Or smile-illumed or dim with tears , Green hills of life that slope to death , And haunts of home , whose vistaed trees Shade off to mournful cypresses With the white amaranths underneath . Even while I look , I can but heed The restless sands ’ incessant fall , Importunate hours that hours succeed , Each clamorous with its own sharp need , And duty keeping pace with all . Shut down and clasp the heavy lids ; I hear again the voice that bids The dreamer leave his dream midway For larger hopes and graver fears Life greatens in these later years , The century 's aloe flowers to-day !</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docDate>Yet , haply , in some lull of life , Some Truce of God which breaks its strife , The worldling 's eyes shall gather dew , Dreaming in throngful city ways Of winter joys his boyhood knew ; And dear and early friends — the few Who yet remain — shall pause to view These Flemish pictures of old days ; Sit with me by the homestead hearth , And stretch the hands of memory forth To warm them at the wood-fire 's blaze ! And thanks untraced to lips unknown Shall greet me like the odors blown From unseen meadows newly mown , Or lilies floating in some pond , Wood-fringed , the wayside gaze beyond ; The traveller owns the grateful sense Of sweetness near , he knows not whence , And , pausing , takes with forehead bare The benediction of the air .<date>1866</date>. MY TRIUMPH . The autumn-time has come ; On woods that dream of bloom , And over purpling vines , The low sun fainter shines . The aster-flower is failing , The hazel 's gold is paling ; Yet overhead more near The eternal stars appear ! And present gratitude Insures the future 's good , And for the things I see I trust the things to be ; That in the paths untrod , And the long days of God , My feet shall still be led , My heart be comforted . O living friends who love me ! O dear ones gone above me ! Careless of other fame , I leave to you my name . Hide it from idle praises , Save it from evil phrases Why , when dear lips that spake it Are dumb , should strangers wake it ? Let the thick curtain fall ; I better know than all How little I have gained , How vast the unattained . Not by the page word-painted Let life be banned or sainted Deeper than written scroll The colors of the soul . Sweeter than any sung My songs that found no tongue ; Nobler than any fact My wish that failed of act . Others shall sing the song , Others shall right the wrong ,— Finish what I begin , And all I fail of win . What matter , I or they ? Mine or another 's day , So the right word be said And life the sweeter made ? Hail to the coming singers Hail to the brave light-bringers ! Forward I reach and share All that they sing and dare . The airs of heaven blow o'er me ; A glory shines before me Of what mankind shall be ,— Pure , generous , brave , and free . A dream of man and woman Diviner but still human , Solving the riddle old , Shaping the Age of Gold . The love of God and neighbor ; An equal-handed labor ; The richer life , where beauty Walks hand in hand with duty . Ring , bells in unreared steeples , The joy of unborn peoples ! Sound , trumpets far off blown , Your triumph is my own ! Parcel and part of all , I keep the festival , Fore-reach the good to be , And share the victory . I feel the earth move sunward , I join the great march onward , And take , by faith , while living , My freehold of thanksgiving .<date>1870</date>. IN SCHOOL-DAYS . Still sits the school-house by the road , A ragged beggar sleeping ; Around it still the sumachs grow , And blackberry-vines are creeping . Within , the master 's desk is seen , Deep scarred by raps official ; The warping floor , the battered seats , The jack-knife 's carved initial ; The charcoal frescos on its wall ; Its door 's worn sill , betraying The feet that , creeping slow to school , Went storming out to playing ! Long years ago a winter sun Shone over it at setting ; Lit up its western window-panes , And low eaves ’ icy fretting . It touched the tangled golden curls , And brown eyes full of grieving , Of one who still her steps delayed When all the school were leaving . For near her stood the little boy Her childish favor singled : His cap pulled low upon a face Where pride and shame were mingled . Pushing with restless feet the snow To right and left , he lingered ;— As restlessly her tiny hands The blue-checked apron fingered . He saw her lift her eyes ; he felt The soft hand 's light caressing , And heard the tremble of her voice , As if a fault confessing . “ I ‘ m sorry that I spelt the word I hate to go above you , Because , ” — the brown eyes lower fell ,— “ Because you see , I love you ! ” Still memory to a gray-haired man That sweet child-face is showing . Dear girl ! the grasses on her grave Have forty years been growing ! He lives to learn , in life 's hard school , How few who pass above him Lament their triumph and his loss , Like her ,— because they love him . MY BIRTHDAY . Beneath the moonlight and the snow Lies dead my latest year ; The winter winds are wailing low Its dirges in my ear . I grieve not with the moaning wind As if a loss befell ; Before me , even as behind , God is , and all is well ! His light shines on me from above , His low voice speaks within ,— The patience of immortal love Outwearying mortal sin . Not mindless of the growing years Of care and loss and pain , My eyes are wet with thankful tears For blessings which remain . If dim the gold of life has grown , I will not count it dross , Nor turn from treasures still my own To sigh for lack and loss . The years no charm from Nature take ; As sweet her voices call , As beautiful her mornings break , As fair her evenings fall . Love watches o'er my quiet ways , Kind voices speak my name , And lips that find it hard to praise Are slow , at least , to blame . How softly ebb the tides of will ! How fields , once lost or won , Now lie behind me green and still Beneath a level sun . How hushed the hiss of party hate , The clamor of the throng ! How old , harsh voices of debate Flow into rhythmic song ! Methinks the spirit 's temper grows Too soft in this still air ; Somewhat the restful heart foregoes Of needed watch and prayer . The bark by tempest vainly tossed May founder in the calm , And he who braved the polar frost Faint by the isles of balm . Better than self-indulgent years The outflung heart of youth , Than pleasant songs in idle ears The tumult of the truth . Rest for the weary hands is good , And love for hearts that pine , But let the manly habitude Of upright souls be mine . Let winds that blow from heaven refresh , Dear Lord , the languid air ; And let the weakness of the flesh Thy strength of spirit share . And , if the eye must fail of light , The ear forget to hear , Make clearer still the spirit 's sight , More fine the inward ear ! Be near me in mine hours of need To soothe , or cheer , or warn , And down these slopes of sunset lead As up the hills of morn !<date>1871</date>. RED RIDING-HOOD . On the wide lawn the snow lay deep , Ridged o'er with many a drifted heap ; The wind that through the pine-trees sung The naked elm-boughs tossed and swung ; While , through the window , frosty-starred , Against the sunset purple barred , We saw the sombre crow flap by , The hawk 's gray fleck along the sky , The crested blue-jay flitting swift , The squirrel poising on the drift , Erect , alert , his broad gray tail Set to the north wind like a sail . It came to pass , our little lass , With flattened face against the glass , And eyes in which the tender dew Of pity shone , stood gazing through The narrow space her rosy lips Had melted from the frost 's eclipse “ Oh , see , ” she cried , “ the poor blue-jays ! What is it that the black crow says ? The squirrel lifts his little legs Because he has no hands , and begs ; He 's asking for my nuts , I know May I not feed them on the snow ? ” Half lost within her boots , her head Warm-sheltered in her hood of red , Her plaid skirt close about her drawn , She floundered down the wintry lawn ; Now struggling through the misty veil Blown round her by the shrieking gale ; Now sinking in a drift so low Her scarlet hood could scarcely show Its dash of color on the snow . She dropped for bird and beast forlorn Her little store of nuts and corn , And thus her timid guests bespoke “ Come , squirrel , from your hollow oak ,— Come , black old crow ,— come , poor blue-jay , Before your supper 's blown away Do n't be afraid , we all are good ; And I 'm mamma 's Red Riding-Hood ! ” O Thou whose care is over all , Who heedest even the sparrow 's fall , Keep in the little maiden 's breast The pity which is now its guest ! Let not her cultured years make less The childhood charm of tenderness , But let her feel as well as know , Nor harder with her polish grow ! Unmoved by sentimental grief That wails along some printed leaf , But , prompt with kindly word and deed To own the claims of all who need , Let the grown woman 's self make good The promise of Red Riding-Hood<date>1877</date>. RESPONSE .</docDate>
    <docImprint>On the occasion of my seventieth birthday in<date>1877</date>, I was the recipient of many tokens of esteem . The publishers of the Atlantic Monthly gave a dinner in my name , and the editor of The Literary World gathered in his paper many affectionate messages from my associates in literature and the cause of human progress . The lines which follow were written in acknowledgment . Beside that milestone where the level sun , Nigh unto setting , sheds his last , low rays On word and work irrevocably done , Life 's blending threads of good and ill outspun , I hear , O friends ! your words of cheer and praise , Half doubtful if myself or otherwise . Like him who , in the old Arabian joke , A beggar slept and crowned Caliph woke . Thanks not the less . With not unglad surprise I see my life-work through your partial eyes ; Assured , in giving to my home-taught songs A higher value than of right belongs , You do but read between the written lines The finer grace of unfulfilled designs . AT EVENTIDE .</docImprint>
    <docDate>Poor and inadequate the shadow-play Of gain and loss , of waking and of dream , Against life 's solemn background needs must seem At this late hour . Yet , not unthankfully , I call to mind the fountains by the way , The breath of flowers , the bird-song on the spray , Dear friends , sweet human loves , the joy of giving And of receiving , the great boon of living In grand historic years when Liberty Had need of word and work , quick sympathies For all who fail and suffer , song 's relief , Nature 's uncloying loveliness ; and chief , The kind restraining hand of Providence , The inward witness , the assuring sense Of an Eternal Good which overlies The sorrow of the world , Love which outlives All sin and wrong , Compassion which forgives To the uttermost , and Justice whose clear eyes Through lapse and failure look to the intent , And judge our frailty by the life we meant .<date>1878</date>. VOYAGE OF THE JETTIE . The picturesquely situated Wayside Inn at West Ossipee , N. H ., is now in ashes ; and to its former guests these somewhat careless rhymes may be a not unwelcome reminder of pleasant summers and autumns on the banks of the Bearcamp and Chocorua . To the author himself they have a special interest from the fact that they were written , or improvised , under the eye and for the amusement of a beloved invalid friend whose last earthly sunsets faded from the mountain ranges of Ossipee and Sandwich . A shallow stream , from fountains Deep in the Sandwich mountains , Ran lake ward Bearcamp River ; And , between its flood-torn shores , Sped by sail or urged by oars No keel had vexed it ever .</docDate>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Alone the dead trees yielding To the dull axe Time is wielding , The shy mink and the otter , And golden leaves and red , By countless autumns shed , Had floated down its water . From the gray rocks of Cape Ann , Came a skilled seafaring man , With his dory , to the right place ; Over hill and plain he brought her , Where the boatless Beareamp water Comes winding down from White-Face . Quoth the skipper : “ Ere she floats forth ; I 'm sure my pretty boat 's worth , At least , a name as pretty . ” On her painted side he wrote it , And the flag that o'er her floated Bore aloft the name of Jettie . On a radiant morn of summer , Elder guest and latest comer Saw her wed the Bearcamp water ; Heard the name the skipper gave her , And the answer to the favor From the Bay State 's graceful daughter . Then , a singer , richly gifted , Her charmed voice uplifted ; And the wood-thrush and song-sparrow Listened , dumb with envious pain , To the clear and sweet refrain Whose notes they could not borrow . Then the skipper plied his oar , And from off the shelving shore , Glided out the strange explorer ; Floating on , she knew not whither ,— The tawny sands beneath her , The great hills watching o'er her . On , where the stream flows quiet As the meadows ’ margins by it , Or widens out to borrow a New life from that wild water , The mountain giant 's daughter , The pine-besung Chocorua . Or , mid the tangling cumber And pack of mountain lumber That spring floods downward force , Over sunken snag , and bar Where the grating shallows are , The good boat held her course . Under the pine-dark highlands , Around the vine-hung islands , She ploughed her crooked furrow And her rippling and her lurches Scared the river eels and perches , And the musk-rat in his burrow . Every sober clam below her , Every sage and grave pearl-grower , Shut his rusty valves the tighter ; Crow called to crow complaining , And old tortoises sat craning Their leathern necks to sight her . So , to where the still lake glasses The misty mountain masses Rising dim and distant northward , And , with faint-drawn shadow pictures , Low shores , and dead pine spectres , Blends the skyward and the earthward , On she glided , overladen , With merry man and maiden Sending back their song and laughter ,— While , perchance , a phantom crew , In a ghostly birch canoe , Paddled dumb and swiftly after ! And the bear on Ossipee Climbed the topmost crag to see The strange thing drifting under ; And , through the haze of August , Passaconaway and Paugus Looked down in sleepy wonder . All the pines that o'er her hung In mimic sea-tones sung The song familiar to her ; And the maples leaned to screen her , And the meadow-grass seemed greener , And the breeze more soft to woo her . The lone stream mystery-haunted , To her the freedom granted To scan its every feature , Till new and old were blended , And round them both extended The loving arms of Nature . Of these hills the little vessel Henceforth is part and parcel ; And on Bearcamp shall her log Be kept , as if by George 's Or Grand Menan , the surges Tossed her skipper through the fog . And I , who , half in sadness , Recall the morning gladness Of life , at evening time , By chance , onlooking idly , Apart from all so widely , Have set her voyage to rhyme . Dies now the gay persistence Of song and laugh , in distance ; Alone with me remaining The stream , the quiet meadow , The hills in shine and shadow , The sombre pines complaining . And , musing here , I dream Of voyagers on a stream From whence is no returning , Under sealed orders going , Looking forward little knowing , Looking back with idle yearning .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docDate>And I pray that every venture The port of peace may enter , That , safe from snag and fall And siren-haunted islet , And rock , the Unseen Pilot May guide us one and all .<date>1880</date>. MY TRUST . A picture memory brings to me I look across the years and see Myself beside my mother 's knee . I feel her gentle hand restrain My selfish moods , and know again A child 's blind sense of wrong and pain . But wiser now , a man gray grown , My childhood 's needs are better known , My mother 's chastening love I own . Gray grown , but in our Father 's sight A child still groping for the light To read His works and ways aright . I wait , in His good time to see That as my mother dealt with me So with His children dealeth He . I bow myself beneath His hand That pain itself was wisely planned I feel , and partly understand . The joy that comes in sorrow 's guise , The sweet pains of self-sacrifice , I would not have them otherwise . And what were life and death if sin Knew not the dread rebuke within , The pang of merciful discipline ? Not with thy proud despair of old , Crowned stoic of Rome 's noblest mould ! Pleasure and pain alike I hold . I suffer with no vain pretence Of triumph over flesh and sense , Yet trust the grievous providence ,</docDate>
    <docTitle><titlePart>How dark soe'er it seems , may tend , By ways I cannot comprehend , To some unguessed benignant end ;</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docDate>That every loss and lapse may gain The clear-aired heights by steps of pain , And never cross is borne in vain .<date>1880</date>.</docDate>

     <head>A NAME</head>
     <p>Addressed to my grand-nephew , Greenleaf Whittier Pickard . Jonathan Greenleaf , in A Genealogy of the Greenleaf Family , says briefly : “ From all that can be gathered , it is believed that the ancestors of the Greenleaf family were Huguenots , who left France on account of their religious principles some time in the course of the sixteenth century , and settled in England . The name was probably translated from the French Feuillevert . ”</p>
