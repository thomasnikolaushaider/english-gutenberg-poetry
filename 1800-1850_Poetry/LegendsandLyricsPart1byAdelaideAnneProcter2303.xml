     <p>“ Our tokens of love are for the most part barbarous . Cold and lifeless , because they do not represent our life . The only gift is a portion of thyself .

     <head>AN INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES DICKENS</head>
     <p>In the spring of the year 1853 , I observed , as conductor of the weekly journal Household Words , a short poem among the proffered contributions , very different , as I thought , from the shoal of verses perpetually setting through the office of such a periodical , and possessing much more merit . Its authoress was quite unknown to me . She was one Miss Mary Berwick , whom I had never heard of ; and she was to be addressed by letter , if addressed at all , at a circulating library in the western district of London . Through this channel , Miss Berwick was informed that her poem was accepted , and was invited to send another . She complied , and became a regular and frequent contributor . Many letters passed between the journal and Miss Berwick , but Miss Berwick herself was never seen .</p>
     <p>How we came gradually to establish , at the office of Household Words , that we knew all about Miss Berwick , I have never discovered . But we settled somehow , to our complete satisfaction , that she was governess in a family ; that she went to Italy in that capacity , and returned ; and that she had long been in the same family . We really knew nothing whatever of her , except that she was remarkably business-like , punctual , self-reliant , and reliable : so I suppose we insensibly invented the rest . For myself , my mother was not a more real personage to me , than Miss Berwick the governess became .</p>
     <p>This went on until December , 1854 , when the Christmas number , entitled The Seven Poor Travellers , was sent to press . Happening to be going to dine that day with an old and dear friend , distinguished in literature as Barry Cornwall , I took with me an early proof of that number , and remarked , as I laid it on the drawing-room table , that it contained a very pretty poem , written by a certain Miss Berwick . Next day brought me the disclosure that I had so spoken of the poem to the mother of its writer , in its writer 's presence ; that I had no such correspondent in existence as Miss Berwick ; and that the name had been assumed by Barry Cornwall 's eldest daughter , Miss Adelaide Anne Procter .</p>
     <p>The anecdote I have here noted down , besides serving to explain why the parents of the late Miss Procter have looked to me for these poor words of remembrance of their lamented child , strikingly illustrates the honesty , independence , and quiet dignity , of the lady 's character . I had known her when she was very young ; I had been honoured with her father 's friendship when I was myself a young aspirant ; and she had said at home , “ If I send him , in my own name , verses that he does not honestly like , either it will be very painful to him to return them , or he will print them for papa 's sake , and not for their own . So I have made up my mind to take my chance fairly with the unknown volunteers . ”</p>
     <p>Perhaps it requires an editor 's experience of the profoundly unreasonable grounds on which he is often urged to accept unsuitable articles — such as having been to school with the writer 's husband 's brother-in-law , or having lent an alpenstock in Switzerland to the writer 's wife 's nephew , when that interesting stranger had broken his own — fully to appreciate the delicacy and the self-respect of this resolution .</p>
     <p>Some verses by Miss Procter had been published in the Book of Beauty , ten years before she became Miss Berwick . With the exception of two poems in the Cornhill Magazine , two in Good Words , and others in a little book called A Chaplet of Verses ( issued in 1862 for the benefit of a Night Refuge ) , her published writings first appeared in Household Words , or All the Year Round . The present edition contains the whole of her Legends and Lyrics , and originates in the great favour with which they have been received by the public .</p>
     <p>Miss Procter was born in Bedford Square , London , on the 30th of October , 1825 . Her love of poetry was conspicuous at so early an age , that I have before me a tiny album made of small note-paper , into which her favourite passages were copied for her by her mother 's hand before she herself could write . It looks as if she had carried it about , as another little girl might have carried a doll . She soon displayed a remarkable memory , and great quickness of apprehension . When she was quite a young child , she learned with facility several of the problems of Euclid . As she grew older , she acquired the French , Italian , and German languages ; became a clever pianoforte player ; and showed a true taste and sentiment in drawing . But , as soon as she had completely vanquished the difficulties of any one branch of study , it was her way to lose interest in it , and pass to another . While her mental resources were being trained , it was not at all suspected in her family that she had any gift of authorship , or any ambition to become a writer . Her father had no idea of her having ever attempted to turn a rhyme , until her first little poem saw the light in print .</p>
     <p>When she attained to womanhood , she had read an extraordinary number of books , and throughout her life she was always largely adding to the number . In 1853 she went to Turin and its neighbourhood , on a visit to her aunt , a Roman Catholic lady . As Miss Procter had herself professed the Roman Catholic Faith two years before , she entered with the greater ardour on the study of the Piedmontese dialect , and the observation of the habits and manners of the peasantry . In the former , she soon became a proficient . On the latter head , I extract from her familiar letters written home to England at the time , two pleasant pieces of description .</p>
     <p>A BETROTHAL</p>
     <p>“ We have been to a ball , of which I must give you a description . Last Tuesday we had just done dinner at about seven , and stepped out into the balcony to look at the remains of the sunset behind the mountains , when we heard very distinctly a band of music , which rather excited my astonishment , as a solitary organ is the utmost that toils up here . I went out of the room for a few minutes , and , on my returning , Emily said , ‘ Oh ! That band is playing at the farmer 's near here . The daughter is fiancee to-day , and they have a ball . ’ I said , ‘ I wish I was going ! ’ ‘ Well , ’ replied she , ‘ the farmer 's wife did call to invite us . ’ ‘ Then I shall certainly go , ’ I exclaimed . I applied to Madame B ., who said she would like it very much , and we had better go , children and all . Some of the servants were already gone . We rushed away to put on some shawls , and put off any shred of black we might have about us ( as the people would have been quite annoyed if we had appeared on such an occasion with any black ) , and we started . When we reached the farmer 's , which is a stone 's throw above our house , we were received with great enthusiasm ; the only drawback being , that no one spoke French , and we did not yet speak Piedmontese . We were placed on a bench against the wall , and the people went on dancing . The room was a large whitewashed kitchen ( I suppose ) , with several large pictures in black frames , and very smoky . I distinguished the Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian , and the others appeared equally lively and appropriate subjects . Whether they were Old Masters or not , and if so , by whom , I could not ascertain . The band were seated opposite us . Five men , with wind instruments , part of the band of the National Guard , to which the farmer 's sons belong . They played really admirably , and I began to be afraid that some idea of our dignity would prevent me getting a partner ; so , by Madame B . ' s advice , I went up to the bride , and offered to dance with her . Such a handsome young woman ! Like one of Uwins 's pictures . Very dark , with a quantity of black hair , and on an immense scale . The children were already dancing , as well as the maids . After we came to an end of our dance , which was what they called a Polka-Mazourka , I saw the bride trying to screw up the courage of her fiance to ask me to dance , which after a little hesitation he did . And admirably he danced , as indeed they all did — in excellent time , and with a little more spirit than one sees in a ball-room . In fact , they were very like one 's ordinary partners , except that they wore earrings and were in their shirt-sleeves , and truth compels me to state that they decidedly smelt of garlic . Some of them had been smoking , but threw away their cigars when we came in . The only thing that did not look cheerful was , that the room was only lighted by two or three oil-lamps , and that there seemed to be no preparation for refreshments . Madame B ., seeing this , whispered to her maid , who disengaged herself from her partner , and ran off to the house ; she and the kitchenmaid presently returning with a large tray covered with all kinds of cakes ( of which we are great consumers and always have a stock ) , and a large hamper full of bottles of wine , with coffee and sugar . This seemed all very acceptable . The fiancee was requested to distribute the eatables , and a bucket of water being produced to wash the glasses in , the wine disappeared very quickly — as fast as they could open the bottles . But , elated , I suppose , by this , the floor was sprinkled with water , and the musicians played a Monferrino , which is a Piedmontese dance . Madame B. danced with the farmer 's son , and Emily with another distinguished member of the company . It was very fatiguing — something like a Scotch reel . My partner was a little man , like Perrot , and very proud of his dancing . He cut in the air and twisted about , until I was out of breath , though my attempts to imitate him were feeble in the extreme . At last , after seven or eight dances , I was obliged to sit down . We stayed till nine , and I was so dead beat with the heat that I could hardly crawl about the house , and in an agony with the cramp , it is so long since I have danced . ”</p>
     <p>A MARRIAGE</p>
     <p>The wedding of the farmer 's daughter has taken place . We had hoped it would have been in the little chapel of our house , but it seems some special permission was necessary , and they applied for it too late . They all said , “ This is the Constitution . There would have been no difficulty before ! ” the lower classes making the poor Constitution the scapegoat for everything they do n't like . So as it was impossible for us to climb up to the church where the wedding was to be , we contented ourselves with seeing the procession pass . It was not a very large one , for , it requiring some activity to go up , all the old people remained at home . It is not etiquette for the bride 's mother to go , and no unmarried woman can go to a wedding — I suppose for fear of its making her discontented with her own position . The procession stopped at our door , for the bride to receive our congratulations . She was dressed in a shot silk , with a yellow handkerchief , and rows of a large gold chain . In the afternoon they sent to request us to go there . On our arrival we found them dancing out of doors , and a most melancholy affair it was . All the bride 's sisters were not to be recognised , they had cried so . The mother sat in the house , and could not appear . And the bride was sobbing so , she could hardly stand ! The most melancholy spectacle of all to my mind was , that the bridegroom was decidedly tipsy . He seemed rather affronted at all the distress . We danced a Monferrino ; I with the bridegroom ; and the bride crying the whole time . The company did their utmost to enliven her by firing pistols , but without success , and at last they began a series of yells , which reminded me of a set of savages . But even this delicate method of consolation failed , and the wishing good-bye began . It was altogether so melancholy an affair that Madame B. dropped a few tears , and I was very near it , particularly when the poor mother came out to see the last of her daughter , who was finally dragged off between her brother and uncle , with a last explosion of pistols . As she lives quite near , makes an excellent match , and is one of nine children , it really was a most desirable marriage , in spite of all the show of distress . Albert was so discomfited by it , that he forgot to kiss the bride as he had intended to do , and therefore went to call upon her yesterday , and found her very smiling in her new house , and supplied the omission . The cook came home from the wedding , declaring she was cured of any wish to marry — but I would not recommend any man to act upon that threat and make her an offer . In a couple of days we had some rolls of the bride 's first baking , which they call Madonnas . The musicians , it seems , were in the same state as the bridegroom , for , in escorting her home , they all fell down in the mud . My wrath against the bridegroom is somewhat calmed by finding that it is considered bad luck if he does not get tipsy at his wedding . ”</p>
     <p>Those readers of Miss Procter 's poems who should suppose from their tone that her mind was of a gloomy or despondent cast , would be curiously mistaken . She was exceedingly humorous , and had a great delight in humour . Cheerfulness was habitual with her , she was very ready at a sally or a reply , and in her laugh ( as I remember well ) there was an unusual vivacity , enjoyment , and sense of drollery . She was perfectly unconstrained and unaffected : as modestly silent about her productions , as she was generous with their pecuniary results . She was a friend who inspired the strongest attachments ; she was a finely sympathetic woman , with a great accordant heart and a sterling noble nature . No claim can be set up for her , thank God , to the possession of any of the conventional poetical qualities . She never by any means held the opinion that she was among the greatest of human beings ; she never suspected the existence of a conspiracy on the part of mankind against her ; she never recognised in her best friends , her worst enemies ; she never cultivated the luxury of being misunderstood and unappreciated ; she would far rather have died without seeing a line of her composition in print , than that I should have maundered about her , here , as “ the Poet ” , or “ the Poetess ” .</p>
     <p>With the recollection of Miss Procter as a mere child and as a woman , fresh upon me , it is natural that I should linger on my way to the close of this brief record , avoiding its end . But , even as the close came upon her , so must it come here .</p>
     <p>Always impelled by an intense conviction that her life must not be dreamed away , and that her indulgence in her favourite pursuits must be balanced by action in the real world around her , she was indefatigable in her endeavours to do some good . Naturally enthusiastic , and conscientiously impressed with a deep sense of her Christian duty to her neighbour , she devoted herself to a variety of benevolent objects . Now , it was the visitation of the sick , that had possession of her ; now , it was the sheltering of the houseless ; now , it was the elementary teaching of the densely ignorant ; now , it was the raising up of those who had wandered and got trodden under foot ; now , it was the wider employment of her own sex in the general business of life ; now , it was all these things at once . Perfectly unselfish , swift to sympathise and eager to relieve , she wrought at such designs with a flushed earnestness that disregarded season , weather , time of day or night , food , rest . Under such a hurry of the spirits , and such incessant occupation , the strongest constitution will commonly go down . Hers , neither of the strongest nor the weakest , yielded to the burden , and began to sink .</p>
     <p>To have saved her life , then , by taking action on the warning that shone in her eyes and sounded in her voice , would have been impossible , without changing her nature . As long as the power of moving about in the old way was left to her , she must exercise it , or be killed by the restraint . And so the time came when she could move about no longer , and took to her bed .</p>
     <p>All the restlessness gone then , and all the sweet patience of her natural disposition purified by the resignation of her soul , she lay upon her bed through the whole round of changes of the seasons . She lay upon her bed through fifteen months . In all that time , her old cheerfulness never quitted her . In all that time , not an impatient or a querulous minute can be remembered .</p>
     <p>At length , at midnight on the second of February , 1864 , she turned down a leaf of a little book she was reading , and shut it up .</p>
     <p>The ministering hand that had copied the verses into the tiny album was soon around her neck , and she quietly asked , as the clock was on the stroke of one :</p>
     <p>“ Do you think I am dying , mamma ? ”</p>
     <p>“ I think you are very , very ill to-night , my dear ! ”</p>
     <p>“ Send for my sister . My feet are so cold . Lift me up ? ”</p>

       <l n="33">Small , yet enough , his hard-earned daily gain .</l>
       <l n="34">He dwelt alone — in sorrow , or in pride .</l>
       <l n="35">He mixed not with the workers by his side ;</l>
       <l n="36">He seemed to care but for one present joy —</l>

       <l n="38">Severe to all beside , yet for the child</l>

       <l n="41">Through the dark gloomy streets ; to him he talked</l>
       <l n="42">Of home , of England , and strange stories told</l>
       <l n="43">Of English heroes in the days of old ;</l>
       <l n="44">And , ( when the sunset gilded roof and spire ,)</l>
       <l n="45">The marvellous tale which never seemed to tire :</l>
       <l n="46">How the gilt dragon , glaring fiercely down</l>
       <l n="47">From the great belfry , watching all the town ,</l>
       <l n="48">Was brought , a trophy of the wars divine ,</l>
       <l n="49">By a Crusader from far Palestine ,</l>
       <l n="50">And given to Bruges ; and how Ghent arose ,</l>
       <l n="51">And how they struggled long as deadly foes ,</l>
       <l n="52">Till Ghent , one night , by a brave soldier 's skill ,</l>
       <l n="53">Stole the great dragon ; and she keeps it still .</l>

       <l n="56">And over desert lands and azure seas ,</l>
       <l n="57">Will seek his home ‘ mid palm and cedar trees .</l>
       <l n="58">So , as he passed the belfry every day ,</l>
       <l n="59">The boy would look if it were flown away ;</l>
       <l n="60">Each day surprised to find it watching there ,</l>
       <l n="61">Above him , as he crossed the ancient square ,</l>
       <l n="62">To seek the great cathedral , that had grown</l>

       <l n="106">On all around , only the windows glowed</l>
       <l n="107">With blazoned glory , like the shields of light</l>
       <l n="108">Archangels bear , who , armed with love and might ,</l>
       <l n="109">Watch upon heaven 's battlements at night .</l>
       <l n="110">Then all was shade ; the silver lamps that gleamed ,</l>

       <l n="145">“ Glory to God , ” re-echoed from her voice ,</l>
       <l n="146">And then his little spirit would rejoice ;</l>
       <l n="147">Or when the Requiem sobbed upon the air ,</l>

       <l n="255">I feel her hold my hand again</l>
       <l n="256">So tightly , that I shrink in pain —</l>
       <l n="257">I seem to hear her say ,</l>
       <l n="258">“ He whom I tell you of , who died ,</l>

       <l n="260">So generous and so brave ,</l>
       <l n="261">That the proud Earl by his dear side</l>
       <l n="262">Would look a craven slave . ”</l>
       <l n="263">She paused ; then , with a quivering sigh ,</l>

       <l n="267">True peace , real honour , and content ,</l>
       <l n="268">In cheerful pious toil abide ;</l>
       <l n="269">That gold and splendour are but sent</l>

       <l n="271">One day some childish fever pain</l>
       <l n="272">Burnt in my veins and fired my brain .</l>
       <l n="273">Moaning , I turned from side to side ;</l>

       <l n="279">The drops of cold November rain</l>
       <l n="280">Were falling from her long , damp hair ;</l>
       <l n="281">Her anxious eyes were dim with pain ;</l>
       <l n="282">Yet she looked wondrous fair .</l>
       <l n="283">Arrayed for some great feast she came ,</l>
       <l n="284">With stones that shone and burnt like flame ;</l>
       <l n="285">Wound round her neck , like some bright snake ,</l>
       <l n="286">And set like stars within her hair ,</l>
       <l n="287">They sparkled so , they seemed to make</l>
       <l n="288">A glory everywhere .</l>
       <l n="289">I felt her tears upon my face ,</l>
       <l n="290">Her kisses on my eyes ;</l>
       <l n="291">And a strange thought I could not trace</l>
       <l n="292">I felt within my heart arise ;</l>
       <l n="293">And , half in feverish pain , I said :</l>
       <l n="294">“ Oh if my mother were not dead ! ”</l>
       <l n="295">And Walter bade me sleep ; but she</l>
       <l n="296">Said , “ Is it not the same to thee</l>
       <l n="297">That I watch by thy bed ? ”</l>
       <l n="298">I answered her , “ I love you , too ;</l>
       <l n="299">But it can never be the same ;</l>

       <l n="302">Oh the wild look of fear and dread !</l>
       <l n="303">The cry she gave of bitter woe !</l>
       <l n="304">I often wonder what I said</l>
       <l n="305">To make her moan and shudder so .</l>
       <l n="306">Through the long night she tended me</l>
       <l n="307">With such sweet care and charity .</l>
       <l n="308">But should weary you to tell</l>
       <l n="309">All that I know and love so well :</l>
       <l n="310">Yet one night more stands out alone</l>
       <l n="311">With a sad sweetness all its own .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="312">The wind blew loud that dreary night :</l>
       <l n="313">Its wailing voice I well remember :</l>
       <l n="314">The stars shone out so large and bright</l>
       <l n="315">Upon the frosty fir-boughs white ,</l>
       <l n="316">That dreary night of cold December .</l>
       <l n="317">I saw old Walter silent stand ,</l>
       <l n="318">Watching the soft white flakes of snow</l>
       <l n="319">With looks I could not understand ,</l>
       <l n="320">Of strange perplexity and woe .</l>
       <l n="321">At last he turned and took my hand ,</l>
       <l n="322">And said the Countess just had sent</l>
       <l n="323">To bid us come ; for she would fain</l>
       <l n="324">See me once more , before she went</l>
       <l n="325">Away — never to come again .</l>
       <l n="326">We came in silence through the wood</l>
       <l n="327">( Our footfall was the only sound )</l>
       <l n="328">To where the great white castle stood ,</l>
       <l n="329">With darkness shadowing it around .</l>
       <l n="330">Breathless , we trod with cautious care</l>
       <l n="331">Up the great echoing marble stair ;</l>
       <l n="332">Trembling , by Walter 's hand I held ,</l>
       <l n="333">Scared by the splendours I beheld :</l>
       <l n="334">Now thinking , “ Should the Earl appear ! ”</l>
       <l n="335">Now looking up with giddy fear</l>
       <l n="336">To the dim vaulted roof , that spread</l>
       <l n="337">Its gloomy arches overhead .</l>
       <l n="338">Long corridors we softly past ,</l>
       <l n="339">( My heart was beating loud and fast )</l>
       <l n="340">And reached the Lady 's room at last :</l>
       <l n="341">A strange faint odour seemed to weigh</l>
       <l n="342">Upon the dim and darkened air ;</l>
       <l n="343">One shaded lamp , with softened ray ,</l>
       <l n="344">Scarce showed the gloomy splendour there .</l>
       <l n="345">The dull red brands were burning low ,</l>
       <l n="346">And yet a fitful gleam of light ,</l>
       <l n="347">Would now and then , with sudden glow ,</l>
       <l n="348">Start forth , then sink again in night .</l>
       <l n="349">I gazed around , yet half in fear ,</l>
       <l n="350">Till Walter told me to draw near :</l>
       <l n="351">And in the strange and flickering light ,</l>
       <l n="352">Towards the Lady 's bed I crept ;</l>
       <l n="353">All folded round with snowy white ,</l>
       <l n="354">She lay ; ( one would have said she slept ;)</l>
       <l n="355">So still the look of that white face ,</l>
       <l n="356">It seemed as it were carved in stone ,</l>
       <l n="357">I paused before I dared to place</l>
       <l n="358">Within her cold white hand my own .</l>
       <l n="359">But , with a smile of sweet surprise ,</l>
       <l n="360">She turned to me her dreamy eyes ;</l>
       <l n="361">And slowly , as if life were pain ,</l>
       <l n="362">She drew me in her arms to lie :</l>
       <l n="363">She strove to speak , and strove in vain ;</l>
       <l n="364">Each breath was like a long-drawn sigh .</l>
       <l n="365">The throbs that seemed to shake her breast ,</l>
       <l n="366">The trembling clasp , so loose and weak ,</l>
       <l n="367">At last grew calmer , and at rest ;</l>
       <l n="368">And then she strove once more to speak :</l>
       <l n="369">“ My God , I thank thee , that my pain</l>
       <l n="370">Of day by day and year by year ,</l>
       <l n="371">Has not been suffered all in vain ,</l>
       <l n="372">And I may die while he is near .</l>
       <l n="373">I will not fear but that Thy grace</l>
       <l n="374">Has swept away my sin and woe ,</l>
       <l n="375">And sent this little angel face ,</l>
       <l n="376">In my last hour to tell me so . ”</l>
       <l n="377">( And here her voice grew faint and low ,)</l>
       <l n="378">“ My child , where'er thy life may go ,</l>
       <l n="379">To know that thou art brave and true ,</l>
       <l n="380">Will pierce the highest heavens through ,</l>
       <l n="381">And even there my soul shall be</l>
       <l n="382">More joyful for this thought of thee . ”</l>
       <l n="383">She folded her white hands , and stayed ;</l>
       <l n="384">All cold and silently she lay :</l>
       <l n="385">I knelt beside the bed , and prayed</l>
       <l n="386">The prayer she used to make me say .</l>
       <l n="387">I said it many times , and then</l>
       <l n="388">She did not move , but seemed to be</l>
       <l n="389">In a deep sleep , nor stirred again .</l>
       <l n="390">No sound woke in the silent room ,</l>
       <l n="391">Or broke the dim and solemn gloom ,</l>
       <l n="392">Save when the brands that burnt so low ,</l>
       <l n="393">With noisy fitful gleam of light ,</l>
       <l n="394">Would spread around a sudden glow ,</l>
       <l n="395">Then sink in silence and in night .</l>
       <l n="396">How long I stood I do not know :</l>
       <l n="397">At last poor Walter came , and said</l>
       <l n="398">( So sadly ) that we now must go ,</l>
       <l n="399">And whispered , she we loved was dead .</l>
       <l n="400">He bade me kiss her face once more ,</l>
       <l n="401">Then led me sobbing to the door .</l>
       <l n="402">I scarcely knew what dying meant ,</l>
       <l n="403">Yet a strange grief , before unknown ,</l>
       <l n="404">Weighed on my spirit as we went</l>
       <l n="405">And left her lying all alone .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="406">We went to the far North once more ,</l>

       <l n="409">Whence now he was too old to roam ;</l>
       <l n="410">And there six happy years we past ,</l>

     <p>The faint low echo that we hear of far-off music seems to fill The silent air with love and fear , and the world 's clamours all grow still , Until the portals close again , and leave us toiling on in pain .</p>

       <l n="1">Complain not that the way is long — what road is weary that leads there ?</l>
       <l n="2">But let the Angel take thy hand , and lead thee up the misty stair ,</l>
       <l n="3">And then with beating heart await , the opening of the Golden Gate .</l>
