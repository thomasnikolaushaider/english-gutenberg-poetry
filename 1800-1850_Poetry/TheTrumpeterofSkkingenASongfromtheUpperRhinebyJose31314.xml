     <p>CHARLES DICKENS AND EVANS . CRYSTAL PALACE PRESS . O Song , at home well known to fame , That German hearts hath deeply stirred And long hath made of Scheffel 's name A dear and honoured household word , Go forth in thy first foreign dress , Go forth to Albion 's noble land ! Will she not greetings kind express , And warmly clasp the stranger 's hand ? The Emerald Isle will surely give A welcome neither cold nor faint ; For on thy pages still doth live The name of Erin 's ancient Saint . Across the sea my country 's shores As Hope 's bright star before me rise ; Will she not open wide her doors To one who on her heart relies ? Farewell , oh work of vanished hours ; When suffering rent my weary heart , Thy breath of fragrant woodland flowers Did life renew , fresh strength impart . Oh Scheffel ! may thy years be long ! And may'st thou live to see the time , When this thy genial Schwarzwald song Will find a home in every clime .</p>

    <p n="38">DEDICATION .</p>
    <p n="39">“ Who is yonder light-haired stranger Who there like a cat is roaming O'er the roof of Don Pagano ? ” — Thus asked many honest burghers , Dwellers on the Isle of Capri , When they from the market turning Looked up at the palm-tree and the Low-arched roof of moorish fashion .</p>
    <p n="40">And the worthy Don Pagano Said : “ That is a strange queer fellow , And most strange his occupation . Came here with but little luggage , Lives here quite alone but happy , Clambers up the steepest mountains , Over cliffs , through surf is strolling , Loves to steal along the sea-shore . Also lately ‘ mid the ruins Of the villa of Tiberius With the hermits there caroused . What 's his business ?— He 's a German , And who knows what they are doing ? But I saw upon his table Heaps of paper written over , Leaving very wasteful margins ; I believe he is half crazy , I believe he 's making verses . ”</p>
    <p n="41">Thus he spoke .— And I myself was This queer stranger . Solitary I had on this rocky island Sung this song of my dear Schwarzwald . I went as a wand'ring scholar To far countries , to Italia ; With much art became acquainted , Also with bad vetturinos , And with many burning flea-bites ; But the sweet fruit of the lotus , Which doth banish love of country And the longing to return there , I have never found here growing .</p>
    <p n="42">‘ Twas in Rome . Hard lay the winter On th ’ eternal sev'nhYpppHeNhilled city : Hard ? for even Marcus Brutus Would have caught a bad catarrh then ; And the rain seemed never-ending . Like a dream then rose the vision Of the Schwarzwald , and the story Of the young musician Werner And the lovely Margaretta . In my youth I have stood often By their graves close to the Rhine shore ; Many things which lie there buried Are , however , long forgotten . But like one to whom a sudden Ringing in his ears betokens That at home of him they 're thinking , So I heard young Werner 's trumpet Through the Roman Winter , through the Carnival 's gay flower-show — Heard it from afar , then nearer , Like the crystal which of vap'rous Fine materials is condensing And increases radiating ; So the figures of this song grew — Even followed me to Naples . In the halls of the Museum Who should meet me but the Baron Shaking his big cane and smiling , And before Pompeii 's gate sat The black tom-cat Hiddigeigei . Purring , quoth he : “ Leave all study ; What is all this ancient rubbish , E'en that dog there in mosaic In the tragic Poet 's dwelling , In comparison with me — the Epic type of all cat-nature ? ”</p>
    <p n="43">This I could no longer stand , so Now began this ghost to banish . From the brother of the lovely Luisella , from the crooked Cunning druggist of Sorrento Quantities of ink I ordered , And sailed o'er the bay to Capri . Here began my exorcisms . Many pale-gold coloured sea-fish , Many lobsters , many oysters , I ate up without compassion ; Drank the red wine like Tiberius , Without mercy poetising ; On the roof went up and down till All resounded metrically , And the charm was then accomplished : Chained up in four-measured trochees Lay those figures which so long now From my couch sweet sleep had banished .</p>
    <p n="44">‘ Twas high time , too ; Spring already Now gave signal of his coming — Buds were sprouting on the fig-trees ; Shots were cracking , for with guns and Nets they were the quails pursuing , Who towards home their flight were taking ; And the minstrel was in peril Then of seeing feathered colleagues Set upon the table roasted . This dread o'er him , pen and inkstand Flew against the wall together . Ready now and newly soled were My strong boots which old Vesuvius Had much damaged with his sulphur . Farther now I journey onward . Up , my good old Marinaro ! Off from land ! the waves with pleasure Bear light hearts and weightless freightage .</p>
    <p n="45">But the song , which with such happy Spring-born feelings from my heart welled , Bears my greetings to my country And to you , my honoured parents . Many faults are in it , truly : Tragic pathos may be wanting , And a racy tendance ; also , As in Amaranth , the fragrant Incense of a pious soul , its Sober but pretentious colouring . Take him , as he is , this ruddy . Rough , uncouth son of the mountains , With a pine branch on his straw hat . What he 's wanting in , pray , cover With the veil of kind indulgence . Take him not as thanks , for always In your Book of Love I 'm debtor , But as greeting and as witness , That a man whom worldly fortune Has not placed ‘ mid smiling verdure , Yet can , happy as a lark pour Out his song on leafless branches .</p>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="3">Five years , my merry song , have now rolled by</l>
       <l n="4">Since thou didst venture thy first course to run ,</l>
       <l n="5">A simple strolling minstrel 's chance to try ,</l>
       <l n="6">But no great laurels so far hast thou won .</l>
       <l n="7">In circles of prosaic breathing mortals</l>
       <l n="8">No praise was given thee of any kind —</l>
       <l n="9">Where formal stiffness bars life 's glowing portals ,</l>
       <l n="10">Thou and thy kindred can no quarter find .</l>
       <l n="11">And in the coteries of hoops and laces</l>
       <l n="12">Few were the readers , fewer still the praises .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">Not everything suits everyone : the hill</l>
       <l n="14">Grows different flowers than the vale and lea :</l>
       <l n="15">But here and there in German homes there will</l>
       <l n="16">Be found some hearts who fondly turn to thee ;</l>
       <l n="17">Where merry fellows are their wine enjoying</l>
       <l n="18">With cheerful songs , thy praises will resound ;</l>
       <l n="19">Near landscape-painters ’ easels thou art lying ,</l>
       <l n="20">And in a huntsman 's bag thou oft art found ,</l>
       <l n="21">And e'en of pastors it has been reported</l>
       <l n="22">To thee as to their prayer-books they 've resorted .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="23">And many who have taken a young bride</l>
       <l n="24">To spend the honeymoon ‘ midst rural scenes ,</l>
       <l n="25">Do like to read thee , sitting side by side ;</l>
       <l n="26">Of happy hours thou often art the means .</l>
       <l n="27">Then Saekkingen , the fair Black Forest 's treasure ,</l>
       <l n="28">Which found at first in thee not much delight ,</l>
       <l n="29">Has by degrees derived from thee great pleasure ,</l>
       <l n="30">And to her heart with love has pressed thee tight .</l>
       <l n="31">Upon the whole , success outweighs detraction ,</l>
       <l n="32">And thou canst view thy fate with satisfaction .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="33">Now that thou wilt a second course begin ,</l>
       <l n="34">I should for thee a better dress prepare ,</l>
       <l n="35">With finer threads the verses ’ measure spin ,</l>
       <l n="36">Here lengthen out , there shorten with more care ,</l>
       <l n="37">I know it well , right often have I faltered ,</l>
       <l n="38">Some of thy trochees sound a little lame ;</l>
       <l n="39">But the old humour now , alas ! is altered ,</l>
       <l n="40">The mood which gave thee birth is not the same .</l>
       <l n="41">O rosy dreams of youth , when joy abounded ,</l>
       <l n="42">Wherefore so soon by gloomy clouds surrounded !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="43">Once more in my dear Schwarzwald I now rest ,</l>
       <l n="44">And near me rush the healing waters out ,</l>
       <l n="45">On high a bird of prey soars o'er his nest ,</l>
       <l n="46">And in the brook are sporting tiny trout .</l>
       <l n="47">From charcoal kilns the smoke clouds are ascending ,</l>
       <l n="48">With iris-coloured hues the sun embrace ,</l>
       <l n="49">And stately giant pines in rows unending ,</l>
       <l n="50">Like wreaths of evergreens , the mountains grace .</l>
       <l n="51">A spicy hay-scent rises from the meadow ,</l>
       <l n="52">And honest folk dwell ‘ neath their thatched roof 's</l>
       <l n="53">shadow .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="54">And yet — should I now try new songs to sing ,</l>
       <l n="55">The old accustomed tone I could not find ;</l>
       <l n="56">Too often grief my soul with pangs doth wring ,</l>
       <l n="57">Instead of mirth , scorn filleth now my mind .</l>
       <l n="58">The world serves idols now , the good ignoring ,</l>
       <l n="59">And truth is silent , beauty hides her face ;</l>
       <l n="60">What is unnatural men are adoring ,</l>
       <l n="61">God is forgotten . Mammon takes his place !</l>
       <l n="62">The Poet , now , should be a prophet warning ,</l>
       <l n="63">Like those of old , reproving , praying , mourning !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="64">‘ Tis not my sphere ; a mighty stirring song</l>
       <l n="65">Requires another man , a different art ;</l>
       <l n="66">But though so much prevails that 's sad and wrong .</l>
       <l n="67">One may not quite disdain a merry heart .</l>
       <l n="68">Go forth , my song , then , as thou didst before ,</l>
       <l n="69">A cheerful memory of life 's fresh spring ;</l>
       <l n="70">Cheer up those hearts , which grief made sad and sore ,</l>
       <l n="71">And to friends far and near my greeting bring .</l>
       <l n="72">Whenever men to nobler aims aspire ,</l>
       <l n="73">Then higher too will ring the poet 's lyre .</l>

       <l n="3">Once more that fragrant air I would be breathing</l>

       <l n="5">As if at my return with joy elated ,</l>

       <l n="1">The Trumpeter now , all alive and refreshed ,</l>

       <l n="3">The present year has both of us blessed ,</l>
       <l n="4">Great favour and lustre bestowing .</l>
       <l n="5">I have my fiftieth year attained ,</l>
       <l n="6">Through joy and through sorrow surviving ,</l>

       <l n="11">But still from these scenes — to tell the truth —</l>
       <l n="12">Great pleasure I now am receiving .</l>
       <l n="13">To the Eggberg I climbed , where on high are seen</l>
       <l n="14">The homes of the Hauenstein peasant ;</l>
       <l n="15">Their straw-thatched roofs with mosses still green ,</l>
       <l n="16">But no more quaint costumes at present .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="17">Through gaps in the forest I see shining bright</l>
       <l n="18">The snow-peaks of Switzerland 's Giants ,</l>
       <l n="19">The steep Finsteraarhorn 's towering height</l>
       <l n="20">The Jungfrau dazzling with diamonds ;</l>

       <l n="22">Blue ridge above ridge is unfolding :</l>

       <l n="29">Gneiss rocks high o'er the grassy shore rise ;</l>

       <l n="9">Ye , who oft beneath your shadow</l>
       <l n="10">Me , the weary one , have sheltered .</l>
       <l n="11">Oddly twisted , spread your roots down</l>
       <l n="12">Deep within the earth 's vast bowels ,</l>
       <l n="13">Strength from out those depths imbibing ,</l>
       <l n="14">While to us is closed the entrance .</l>
       <l n="15">And you envy not a transient</l>
       <l n="16">Human being 's transient doings .</l>
       <l n="17">Only smile ;— his feast at Christmas</l>
       <l n="18">You adorn with your young scions .</l>
       <l n="19">In your sturdy trunks lives also</l>
       <l n="20">Conscious life-sustaining power .</l>
       <l n="21">Resin through your veins is coursing ;</l>
       <l n="22">And your dreamy thoughts are surging</l>
       <l n="23">Slow and heavy , upward , downward .</l>
       <l n="24">Oft I saw the clear and gummy</l>
       <l n="25">Tears which from your bark were oozing ,</l>
       <l n="26">When a woodman 's wanton axe-stroke</l>
       <l n="27">Rudely felled some loved companion .</l>
       <l n="28">Oft I heard your topmost summits</l>
       <l n="29">Spirit-like together whisper .</l>
       <l n="30">Then there breathed throughout my soul a</l>
       <l n="31">Sweet mysterious solemn dreaming .</l>
       <l n="32">Do n't find fault then , if my song now</l>
       <l n="33">Soars within the forest shades .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="34">‘ Twas in March : still played the Winter</l>
       <l n="35">Masquerade ; the branches , laden</l>
       <l n="36">With fantastical ice-crystals ,</l>
       <l n="37">To the ground were lowly drooping ;</l>
       <l n="38">Here and there , out of Earth 's bosom</l>
       <l n="39">Tender plants their heads were thrusting —</l>
       <l n="40">Wood-anemones and cowslips .</l>
       <l n="41">As the patriarch , old Noah ,</l>
       <l n="42">At the time of the great Deluge ,</l>
       <l n="43">Sent the dove to reconnoitre :</l>
       <l n="44">So with winter 's ice sore burdened ,</l>
       <l n="45">With impatience sends the Earth forth</l>
       <l n="46">These first flowers with a question ,</l>
       <l n="47">Asking , whether the oppressor</l>
       <l n="48">Has not come to his last gasp yet .</l>
       <l n="49">Blustering from the Feldberg 's summit</l>
       <l n="50">Now old Master Storm is rushing ,</l>
       <l n="51">And rejoices , through the dark dense</l>
       <l n="52">Forest he again is blowing ;</l>
       <l n="53">Says : “ I greet you , ancient comrades ;</l>
       <l n="54">Why I come , you know the reason —</l>
       <l n="55">They believe , poor mortal children ,</l>
       <l n="56">When they see me tearing , snatching</l>
       <l n="57">Roughly some old hat away ,</l>
       <l n="58">I am only there to frighten .</l>
       <l n="59">That would be a pretty business ,</l>
       <l n="60">Breaking chimneys , smashing windows ,</l>
       <l n="61">Scattering through the air some thatchings ,</l>
       <l n="62">Tearing some old woman 's clothing</l>
       <l n="63">Till she signs the cross in praying !</l>
       <l n="64">But you fir-trees know me better ,</l>
       <l n="65">Me , the fair Spring 's thorough cleaner ,</l>
       <l n="66">Who what 's mouldy sweeps afar off —</l>
       <l n="67">Who what 's rotten blows to pieces —</l>
       <l n="68">Who the earth 's domain well cleanses ,</l>
       <l n="69">That his radiant Lord and Master</l>
       <l n="70">Worthily may make his entrance .</l>
       <l n="71">And you , noble forest comrades ,</l>
       <l n="72">Who so oft , with bronze-like foreheads ,</l>
       <l n="73">Bravely have withstood my rudeness ,</l>
       <l n="74">Ye whose trunks I have to thank for</l>
       <l n="75">Many knocks against my skull-bone ,</l>
       <l n="76">Ye alone shall hear my secret :</l>
       <l n="77">Soon the Spring himself he cometh ,</l>
       <l n="78">And then , when the buds are bursting ,</l>
       <l n="79">Lark and blackbird sing their carols ,</l>
       <l n="80">And with fervent heat the Spring sun</l>
       <l n="81">Brightly on your heads is shining ,</l>
       <l n="82">Then remember me , the Storm-wind ,</l>
       <l n="83">Who to-day , with boisterous fury</l>
       <l n="84">As his harbinger swept past . ”</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="85">Speaking thus , he shook the tree-tops</l>
       <l n="86">With great roughness ; boughs are snapping ,</l>
       <l n="87">Branches falling , and a thick , fine</l>
       <l n="88">Rain of pine-leaves crackles downward .</l>
       <l n="89">But the fir-trees , quite indignant ,</l>
       <l n="90">Took small notice of this homage .</l>
       <l n="91">From their summits rang the answer ,</l>
       <l n="92">Rather scolding , I should call it :</l>
       <l n="93">“ You unmannerly rude fellow !</l>
       <l n="94">We will have no business with you ,</l>
       <l n="95">And regret much that the finest</l>
       <l n="96">Lords have oft the rudest servants .</l>
       <l n="97">To the Alps begone directly ,</l>
       <l n="98">There is sport fit for your humour ;</l>
       <l n="99">There stand walls of rock all barren ;</l>
       <l n="100">Entertain yourself with them there . ”</l>

       <l n="101">Now , while thus the storm and fir-trees</l>
       <l n="102">Held such converse with each other ,</l>
       <l n="103">Could be heard a horse 's footfall .</l>
       <l n="104">Toiling through the snow-piled wood-path</l>
       <l n="105">Seeks his way a weary horseman ;</l>
       <l n="106">Gaily flutters in the storm-wind ,</l>
       <l n="107">To and fro , his long gray mantle ,</l>
       <l n="108">His fair curling locks are waving ,</l>
       <l n="109">And , from out the cocked-up hat there</l>
       <l n="110">Boldly nods a heron 's feather .</l>
       <l n="111">On his lips was just appearing</l>
       <l n="112">Such a downy beard as ladies</l>
       <l n="113">Much admire , because it showeth</l>
       <l n="114">That its bearer is a man , still</l>
       <l n="115">One whose kisses will not wound them .</l>
       <l n="116">But not many pretty lips had</l>
       <l n="117">Felt the soft touch of this beard yet .</l>
       <l n="118">Which , as if for fun and mischief ,</l>
       <l n="119">Snow and ice now decked with crystals .</l>
       <l n="120">In his clear blue eyes were glowing</l>
       <l n="121">Warmth and mildness , earnest meaning ,</l>
       <l n="122">And you could not doubt his fist would</l>
       <l n="123">Strike a valiant blow , when needed ,</l>
       <l n="124">With the heavy basket-hilted</l>
       <l n="125">Sword , which , worn suspended by a</l>
       <l n="126">Black belt from his shoulder , well-nigh</l>
       <l n="127">Grazed the ground as he was riding .</l>
       <l n="128">Wound around his riding-doublet</l>
       <l n="129">Was a sash , to which was tied the</l>
       <l n="130">Richly-gilded shining trumpet ,</l>
       <l n="131">Which he often with his mantle</l>
       <l n="132">Sheltered from the falling snow-flakes ;</l>
       <l n="133">But , whene'er the wind pierced through it ,</l>
       <l n="134">Bringing forth tones shrill and wailing ;</l>
       <l n="135">Then around his mouth there played a</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="137">Silent through the forest 's thicket</l>
       <l n="138">On he rode , while often roving</l>

       <l n="140">When a wanderer for the first time</l>
       <l n="141">Over unknown roads is travelling .</l>
       <l n="142">Rough the path — the poor horse often</l>
       <l n="143">In the snow was nearly sinking ,</l>
       <l n="144">And o'er gnarl 'd and tangled branches</l>
       <l n="145">Of the knotted pine-roots stumbling .</l>
       <l n="146">And the rider , in ill-humour ,</l>
       <l n="147">Said : “ Sometimes it is quite tedious ,</l>
       <l n="148">Through the world alone to travel .</l>
       <l n="149">There are times , ‘ mid gloomy forests ,</l>
       <l n="150">When one longeth for companions .</l>

       <l n="152">To the good monks of St. Blasien ,</l>

       <l n="154">Scattered here and there , a peasant ,</l>
       <l n="155">Through the snow-storm running swiftly ,</l>
       <l n="156">Hardly did my greeting notice .</l>
       <l n="157">Then a pair of coal-black ravens ,</l>
       <l n="158">Who with hoarse discordant croakings ,</l>
       <l n="159">O'er a dead mole fiercely quarrelled ;</l>
       <l n="160">For the past two hours , however ,</l>

       <l n="169">Who escorted the old knight once</l>
       <l n="170">Through the forest 's gloom and thicket ;</l>
       <l n="171">Then appeared as Death and Devil ,</l>
       <l n="172">Grinning in his face with scorn !</l>
       <l n="173">I should rather ride with them now —</l>
       <l n="174">Rather fight them , or play lively</l>
       <l n="175">Dances for them , than so lonely</l>
       <l n="176">Thus to trot through this dense forest . ”</l>

       <l n="359">Will he make in my good larder !</l>
       <l n="360">Now farewell , you lovely brook-trout ,</l>
       <l n="361">Which I had reserved for Sunday ,</l>
       <l n="362">When the Dean of Wehr will dine here .</l>
       <l n="363">Now farewell , thou hough of bacon !</l>
       <l n="364">The old clucking hen , I fear much ,</l>
       <l n="365">Also now must fall a victim ,</l>

       <l n="4">On the dish , right hot and steaming</l>
       <l n="5">Had a roasted fowl paraded ,</l>
       <l n="6">But it had completely vanished ;</l>
       <l n="7">Only now a spicy fragrance</l>
       <l n="8">Floated gently through the chamber ,</l>
       <l n="9">Like the songs by which the minstrel</l>
       <l n="10">Still lives on through after ages ;</l>

       <l n="47">Farther on the little band went ,</l>

       <l n="333">One thing thou canst ne'er restore me ,</l>

       <l n="338">In the meshes of my glances !</l>

       <l n="344">Next the train of noble ladies</l>

       <l n="346">At the end the elder matrons .</l>
       <l n="347">Only one in work-day garments</l>
       <l n="348">Kept aloof from the procession ,</l>
       <l n="349">‘ Twas the hostess from the ancient</l>
       <l n="350">Tavern of the “ Golden Button ; ”</l>
       <l n="351">So demanded ancient custom .</l>
       <l n="352">There — so learn we from the legend —</l>
       <l n="353">Stood once in those heathen ages</l>
       <l n="354">An old tavern ; Fridolinus ,</l>
       <l n="355">When he first upon the island</l>
       <l n="356">Set his foot , had there sought shelter ;</l>
       <l n="357">But the landlord , a rude heathen ,</l>
       <l n="358">Spoke unto the holy man thus :</l>
       <l n="359">“ All you priests are good for nothing ,</l>
       <l n="360">But to vilify our old gods ;</l>
       <l n="361">And you seldom carry even</l>
       <l n="362">One red farthing in your pocket .</l>
       <l n="363">So begone from off my threshold ! ”</l>
       <l n="364">Now the purse of Fridolinus</l>
       <l n="365">Had indeed but little in it ,</l>
       <l n="366">And he had to take his night 's rest</l>
       <l n="367">Underneath the shady lindens</l>
       <l n="368">In the meadow . But the angels</l>
       <l n="369">Cared well for him , and he found out ,</l>
       <l n="370">On awaking , that his purse was</l>
       <l n="371">Filled with golden Roman pieces .</l>
       <l n="372">Then again the Saint did visit</l>
       <l n="373">The inhospitable tavern ,</l>
       <l n="374">Took a meal , and paid in shining</l>
       <l n="375">Money what the host demanded ;</l>
       <l n="376">And to shame him left moreover</l>
       <l n="377">Seven gold coins as a present .</l>
       <l n="378">Thus for an eternal warning</l>
       <l n="379">To all landlords void of pity ,</l>
       <l n="380">Although ages had elapsed since ,</l>
       <l n="381">No one from the “ Golden Button ”</l>

       <l n="393">In the front they bore a statue</l>

       <l n="399">In that lovely file the fourth one</l>

       <l n="404">Like the hoar-frost in the Spring-time</l>
       <l n="405">Glistening on the early rosebud .</l>

       <l n="414">Gazed , and gazed ; when the procession</l>
       <l n="415">Turned the corner of a side street</l>
       <l n="416">Still he gazed , as if the fourth one</l>

       <l n="418">“ He is caught ! ” so goes the saying</l>
       <l n="419">In that country , when one 's soul is</l>

       <l n="3">In the honoured Saint 's procession ,</l>
       <l n="4">Now sat , equally united ,</l>
       <l n="5">Drinking the good wine before them ,</l>
       <l n="6">Or the golden foaming beer .</l>
       <l n="7">Corks were popping , glasses ringing ;</l>
       <l n="8">Many huge and mighty goblets</l>
       <l n="9">By the guests were emptied quickly ,</l>
       <l n="10">In St Fridolinus ’ honour .</l>
       <l n="11">Simpering with delight , the landlord</l>

       <l n="13">And , with a devout expression ,</l>
       <l n="14">Chalked them all upon the blackboard .</l>
       <l n="15">From the inn outside the gate , which</l>
       <l n="16">By the peasants was frequented ,</l>
       <l n="17">Came gay music ; for , with legs crossed ,</l>
       <l n="18">There sat , playing on his fiddle ,</l>
       <l n="19">Schwefelhans , the violinist ;</l>
       <l n="20">And in wild and boisterous dances</l>
       <l n="21">Were the Hauenstein young peasants</l>
       <l n="22">Twirling round their buxom partners .</l>
       <l n="23">Groaning was the floor , and shaking</l>
       <l n="24">‘ Neath their feet and heavy stamping ,</l>
       <l n="25">From the walls the plaster falling ,</l>
       <l n="26">So uproarious was their shouting .</l>
       <l n="27">From afar , with turned-up noses ,</l>
       <l n="28">Many dandies looked on sneering ;</l>
       <l n="29">Yet , within themselves were thinking :</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="31">The sedate and older people</l>
       <l n="32">Sat together in the tap-room .</l>
       <l n="33">As their ancestors delighted</l>
       <l n="34">To get drunk in Woden 's honour ,</l>
       <l n="35">So , in true historic spirit .</l>
       <l n="36">They for Fridolin got tipsy .</l>
       <l n="37">Many troubled faithful consorts</l>
       <l n="38">Pulled their husbands by the coat-tail ,</l>
       <l n="39">When the second and the third piece</l>
       <l n="40">Of hard money here was squandered ;</l>
       <l n="41">But the husband said quite coolly :</l>
       <l n="42">“ Dearest wife , control thy humour ,</l>
       <l n="43">For to-day all must be spent here ! ”</l>
       <l n="44">And he left not till the watchman</l>
       <l n="45">With the halberd came and ordered</l>
       <l n="46">That ‘ twas time to close the tavern .</l>
       <l n="47">With uncertain steps , ill-humoured ,</l>
       <l n="48">To his mountain-home he totters :</l>
       <l n="49">And the silent night is witness</l>
       <l n="50">Of some sudden headlong tumbles .</l>
       <l n="51">But she covers them with darkness —</l>
       <l n="52">Kindly — as she does the beating</l>

       <l n="55">Lonely , far-off from the bustle ,</l>

       <l n="57">Without thinking where he wandered .</l>
       <l n="58">Still before his eyes there hovered</l>
       <l n="59">Those sweet features of the maiden</l>
       <l n="60">Which he had beheld that morning ,</l>
       <l n="61">But now seemed a dream 's fair vision .</l>
       <l n="62">Burning was his brow ; his eyes now</l>
       <l n="63">Restlessly strayed up to heaven ,</l>
       <l n="64">Then he cast them meekly downward ,</l>
       <l n="65">As if asking where to find her ;</l>
       <l n="66">And he did not mind the north wind ,</l>
       <l n="67">Which his locks dishevelled sadly .</l>
       <l n="68">Through his heart hot glowing thoughts ran</l>
       <l n="69">Wildly chasing one another ,</l>
       <l n="70">Like the mist , which in the autumn</l>
       <l n="71">Moves around the tops of mountains</l>
       <l n="72">In most oddly-changing shapes ;</l>
       <l n="73">And it rang and surged within him ,</l>
       <l n="74">Like the first germ of a poem</l>
       <l n="75">Growing in the mind 's recesses .</l>

       <l n="76">Also , thus , in bygone ages ,</l>
       <l n="77">By the Arno strolled another</l>
       <l n="78">Child of man , plunged in deep musing ;</l>
       <l n="79">And he also blew the trumpet ,</l>
       <l n="80">Which , like that of the last judgment ,</l>
       <l n="81">Rang aloud , in piercing notes , through</l>
       <l n="82">His benighted rotten age .</l>
       <l n="83">But when he , upon that feast-day ,</l>
       <l n="84">First beheld the wondrous maiden</l>
       <l n="85">Who his leading star through life was ,</l>
       <l n="86">And to Paradise did lead him ;</l>
       <l n="87">He then wandered by the river ,</l>
       <l n="88">Under shady oaks and myrtles ;</l>
       <l n="89">And , for all the joyful feelings</l>
       <l n="90">Which within his heart were ringing ,</l>
       <l n="91">He could only find the utterance :</l>
       <l n="92">“ Beatrice ! Beatrice ! ”</l>

       <l n="95">Others , who with love are stricken ,</l>

       <l n="102">Murmur the sweet words : “ I love thee ! ”</l>
       <l n="103">Do you know them ? They have noses</l>

       <l n="305">And where through a secret wicket</l>
       <l n="306">To the strand came down the fisher ,</l>
       <l n="307">Was a quiet hidden inlet ,</l>
       <l n="308">Where lay boat and rudder ready .</l>
       <l n="309">As the boatman kept the feast-day ,</l>
       <l n="310">So without permission Werner</l>
       <l n="311">Took possession of the boat there .</l>
       <l n="312">In the meantime evening crept on :</l>
       <l n="313">Here and there rang from the mountains</l>
       <l n="314">Clear and sharp , a shouting from some</l>
       <l n="315">Tipsy peasant going homeward .</l>
       <l n="316">O'er those distant pine-tree forests</l>
       <l n="317">Streamed the moonlight through the valley ;</l>
       <l n="318">Bashfully some stars already</l>
       <l n="319">From the clear blue sky were peeping .</l>
       <l n="320">From the shore shoved off young Werner .</l>
       <l n="321">As a horse , when in his stable</l>
       <l n="322">Long imprisoned , gaily prances ,</l>
       <l n="323">Neighs with joy , when he can carry</l>
       <l n="324">Through the fields again his master :</l>
       <l n="325">So shot boldly swiftly downward ,</l>
       <l n="326">On the water gaily bounding ,</l>
       <l n="327">The light boat , and speeding onward</l>
       <l n="328">Passed the walls of the old city .</l>
       <l n="329">Soon it gained the ancient Rhine bridge ,</l>
       <l n="330">Which with timber-covered arches</l>
       <l n="331">Boldly spans from shore to shore .</l>
       <l n="332">And courageously young Werner</l>
       <l n="333">Steered right through below the third pier ,</l>
       <l n="334">Laughing , when , as if to vex him ,</l>
       <l n="335">Three times up and three times downward</l>
       <l n="336">Danced his boat , seized by the whirlpool</l>
       <l n="337">Soon he now beheld the castle</l>
       <l n="338">With its gable-roofs and turrets ,</l>
       <l n="339">Shining through the lofty chestnuts ,</l>
       <l n="340">All illumined by the moonlight .</l>
       <l n="341">Yonder rose up from the river</l>
       <l n="342">By the shore a bank of gravel ,</l>
       <l n="343">Bare and barren ; it was often</l>
       <l n="344">Flooded over by the river .</l>
       <l n="345">Out of fun the country people</l>
       <l n="346">Called it field of Fridolinus .</l>
       <l n="347">Thither now the frail boat drifted ;</l>
       <l n="348">There it halted on the shelving</l>
       <l n="349">Pebbly ground . Out jumped young Werner ,</l>
       <l n="350">And he looked with eager glances</l>
       <l n="351">Whether he could not descry her .</l>
       <l n="352">He could only see a distant</l>
       <l n="353">Twinkling light up in the turret ;</l>
       <l n="354">But this wholly satisfied him .</l>
       <l n="355">Often doth a distant vision</l>
       <l n="356">More delight bestow upon us</l>
       <l n="357">Than the fulness of possession ;</l>
       <l n="358">Hence our Song dwells on his pleasure ,</l>
       <l n="359">As he stands there on the sand-bank</l>
       <l n="360">At that light in rapture gazing .</l>
       <l n="361">Spread before his dreamy eyes lay</l>
       <l n="362">Rosy visions of the future ;</l>
       <l n="363">Neither sun nor stars shone in them ,</l>
       <l n="364">Nothing but that light 's faint glimmer .</l>
       <l n="365">From the turret , where it flickered ,</l>
       <l n="366">Love flew forth , on rapid pinions ,</l>
       <l n="367">Noiselessly to him descended ,</l>
       <l n="368">And unseen stood there beside him</l>
       <l n="369">On the field of Fridolinus ;</l>
       <l n="370">And he handed him the trumpet</l>
       <l n="371">Which from Werner 's neck was hanging ,</l>
       <l n="372">Saying : Blow your trumpet , blow it !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="373">And he blew until his blowing</l>
       <l n="374">Filled with melody the night air .</l>
       <l n="375">In the depths the Rhine was listening ,</l>
       <l n="376">Salmon , trout , and pike were listening ,</l>
       <l n="377">Water-nymphs were listening also ,</l>
       <l n="378">And the wind the ringing tones bore</l>
       <l n="379">To the castle tenderly .</l>

       <l n="11">Now , my Muse , mount upward to the</l>
       <l n="12">Castle gate , behold there sculptured</l>
       <l n="13">The three balls upon the scutcheon .</l>
       <l n="14">As in the armorial bearings</l>
       <l n="15">Of the Medici in Florence —</l>
       <l n="16">Signs of ancient , noble lineage ;</l>
       <l n="17">Now ascend the steps of sandstone ,</l>
       <l n="18">Loudly knock at the great hall door ,</l>
       <l n="19">Then step in and give report of</l>
       <l n="20">What thou there hast slyly noticed .</l>
       <l n="21">In the spacious , lofty knights ’ hall ,</l>
       <l n="22">With its walls of panelled oak-wood .</l>
       <l n="23">And with rows of old ancestral</l>
       <l n="24">Dusty portraits decorated ,</l>
       <l n="25">There the Baron took his comfort ,</l>
       <l n="26">Seated in his easy arm-chair</l>
       <l n="27">By the cheerful blazing fire .</l>
       <l n="28">His mustache was gray already ;</l>
       <l n="29">On his forehead , which a Swedish</l>
       <l n="30">Troopers sword had deeply scarred once ,</l>
       <l n="31">Many wrinkles had been furrowed</l>
       <l n="32">Also by the hand of Time .</l>
       <l n="33">And a most unpleasant guest had</l>
       <l n="34">Taken quarters uninvited</l>
       <l n="35">In the left foot of the Baron .</l>
       <l n="36">Gout ‘ tis called in vulgar parlance ,</l>
       <l n="37">But if any learned person</l>
       <l n="38">Rather podagra should call it ,</l>
       <l n="39">I shall offer no objection ;</l>
       <l n="40">Not the less will be its torments .</l>
       <l n="41">Just this day the pangs were milder ,</l>
       <l n="42">Only now and then increasing ,</l>
       <l n="43">When the Baron , smiling , spoke thus :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="44">“ Zounds ! ‘ tis evident that in the</l>

       <l n="47">Something of the art of tactics .</l>
       <l n="48">The attack begins in order ;</l>
       <l n="49">First the skirmishers go forward ,</l>
       <l n="50">Then the flying columns follow .</l>
       <l n="51">Oh , I wish the devil had them ,</l>
       <l n="52">This whole reconnoitring party !</l>
       <l n="53">But not even this sufficeth .</l>

       <l n="64">To the Rhine are sloping downward ,</l>
       <l n="65">Where the vintner , while at labour ,</l>

       <l n="71">As his usual evening beverage .</l>
       <l n="72">And , to heighten his enjoyment ,</l>
       <l n="73">He puffed out clouds of tobacco .</l>
       <l n="74">In his red and simple clay-pipe</l>
       <l n="75">Burned the weed from foreign countries ,</l>
       <l n="76">Which he smoked through a long pipe-stem</l>

       <l n="404">Came a dream most sweet and wondrous :</l>
       <l n="405">As she walked to the old minster</l>
       <l n="406">Once again in festal garments ,</l>
       <l n="407">Fridolinus came to meet her ;</l>
       <l n="408">By his side there walked another ,</l>
       <l n="409">But ‘ twas not the dead man who once</l>
       <l n="410">Followed him to Glarus court-house ;</l>
       <l n="411">‘ Twas a youth , fair , tall , and slender ;</l>
       <l n="412">Like a trumpeter he looked , and</l>
       <l n="413">Greeted her with lowly reverence ;</l>
       <l n="414">While Saint Fridolin was smiling .</l>

      <head>SIXTH PART .</head>
      <head>HOW YOUNG WERNER BECAME THE BARON 'S TRUMPETER .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Master Anton started early</l>
       <l n="2">The next morning for the city ,</l>
       <l n="3">To find out that trumpet blower .</l>
       <l n="4">By St. Fridolin 's cathedral</l>
       <l n="5">He turned off into a side-street .</l>
       <l n="6">From the other side there came with</l>
       <l n="7">Rapid steps the boatman Martin ,</l>
       <l n="8">And they met just at the corner ,</l>
       <l n="9">Bumping up against each other .</l>
       <l n="10">“ ‘ Pon my soul , ” cried out the worthy</l>
       <l n="11">Anton , as he rubbed his forehead ;</l>
       <l n="12">“ Your thick skull is hard as iron . ”</l>
       <l n="13">“ Yours is not upholstered either</l>
       <l n="14">With soft wool or springy sea-weed , ”</l>
       <l n="15">Was the boatman 's ready answer .</l>
       <l n="16">“ And what business have you running</l>
       <l n="17">Through the city 's streets thus early ? ”</l>
       <l n="18">“ I can ask the same , ” said Anton .</l>
       <l n="19">“ I seek someone who last evening</l>
       <l n="20">From the shore my boat unfastened , ”</l>
       <l n="21">Answered him the boatman Martin .</l>
       <l n="22">“ He may be my man , ” said Anton .</l>
       <l n="23">“ When I came down to the river ,</l>
       <l n="24">There I found my boat turned over</l>
       <l n="25">On the shore — the rudder broken ,</l>
       <l n="26">And the fastening cut asunder .</l>
       <l n="27">If a thunderstorm would only</l>
       <l n="28">Sweep away these wicked people ,</l>
       <l n="29">Who like thieves at night are roving</l>
       <l n="30">On the Rhine in borrowed vessels . ”</l>
       <l n="31">“ And the trumpet blow , ” said Anton .—</l>
       <l n="32">“ But whenever I shall find him ,</l>
       <l n="33">To the justice I shall take him .</l>
       <l n="34">He must pay me ; even for the</l>
       <l n="35">Black and blue mark which you gave me ,</l>
       <l n="36">I shall bring a heavy reckoning .</l>
       <l n="37">It is shameful how this fellow</l>
       <l n="38">Gives me such vexation ! ” Thus the</l>
       <l n="39">Boatman scolding went on farther .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="40">“ And I do not see myself , why</l>
       <l n="41">I should take such extra trouble</l>
       <l n="42">To hunt up this mischief-maker , ”</l>
       <l n="43">Said old Anton to himself then .</l>
       <l n="44">“ Seems to me it is already</l>
       <l n="45">Just the time when honest people</l>
       <l n="46">For their morning draught are longing . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="47">To the “ Golden Button 's ” shady</l>
       <l n="48">Tap-room turned the worthy Anton</l>
       <l n="49">Now his steps , and through a side-door</l>
       <l n="50">In he stepped : he deemed it wiser</l>
       <l n="51">Thus to hide before the public</l>
       <l n="52">Such an early morning visit .</l>
       <l n="53">Many worthy folks already</l>
       <l n="54">Had there quietly assembled</l>
       <l n="55">O'er their brimming foaming bumpers .</l>
       <l n="56">Like red roses shone their faces ,</l>
       <l n="57">And like radishes their noses .</l>
       <l n="58">“ Want a big glass ? ” asked the waitress</l>
       <l n="59">Our old Anton , who assented :</l>
       <l n="60">“ To be sure ! hot is the weather ,</l>
       <l n="61">And when I woke up , already</l>
       <l n="62">In my throat I felt a dryness . ”</l>
       <l n="63">So good Anton soon was drinking</l>
       <l n="64">From his large Bohemian bumper ,</l>
       <l n="65">Turning over in his mind well ,</l>
       <l n="66">How he should despatch his business .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="67">In the private room was sitting ,</l>
       <l n="68">Just then Werner with the landlord ,</l>
       <l n="69">Who had served for his guest 's breakfast</l>
       <l n="70">A fine slice of red smoked salmon ,</l>
       <l n="71">And commenced with the young stranger</l>
       <l n="72">An instructive conversation :</l>
       <l n="73">On the vintage in the Rhine-Pfalz ,</l>
       <l n="74">How the price of hops was standing ,</l>
       <l n="75">How they fared in time of war there .</l>
       <l n="76">Now and then , to sound the stranger ,</l>
       <l n="77">He threw slyly out some questions ,</l>
       <l n="78">Whence he came and what his business .</l>
       <l n="79">Still he gained no satisfaction ;</l>
       <l n="80">But quite shrewdly thus he reasoned :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="81">“ He 's no bookworm , for he seemeth</l>
       <l n="82">Much too martial — nor a soldier</l>
       <l n="83">Either , as he looks too modest ;</l>
       <l n="84">He may be a necromancer ,</l>
       <l n="85">An adept in all dark witchcraft ,</l>
       <l n="86">Alchemy , and other black arts .</l>
       <l n="87">Wait , I 'll catch thee ; ” and he turned their</l>
       <l n="88">Talk to hidden buried treasures ,</l>
       <l n="89">And to midnight exorcisms .</l>
       <l n="90">“ Yes , my friend , here near the city</l>
       <l n="91">Lies a sandbank in the river .</l>
       <l n="92">At the time of Fridolinus</l>
       <l n="93">Heaps of gold coin there were buried .</l>
       <l n="94">One who knows , a clever fellow ,</l>
       <l n="95">Could there dig and make his fortune . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="96">“ I already saw the sandbank , ”</l>
       <l n="97">Said young Werner , “ when I rowed there</l>
       <l n="98">On the Rhine last night by moonlight . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="99">“ What , you know it then already ? ”</l>
       <l n="100">Said the landlord much astonished .</l>
       <l n="101">“ Have I caught thee ? ” he thought , keenly</l>
       <l n="102">Looking at young Werner 's pockets ,</l>
       <l n="103">If he could not hear a jingling</l>
       <l n="104">Of great lots of golden money .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="105">“ Have I caught thee ? ” also gladly</l>
       <l n="106">To himself said worthy Anton .</l>
       <l n="107">“ It is , after all , the right thing</l>
       <l n="108">Thus to take an early potion . ”</l>
       <l n="109">From the spot where he was seated</l>
       <l n="110">He had heard their conversation ;</l>
       <l n="111">And besides upon the table .</l>
       <l n="112">By the stranger 's sword and cocked hat ,</l>
       <l n="113">Also lay the sought-for trumpet .</l>
       <l n="114">Drawing near , then , he said gravely :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="115">“ With your leave , if you 're no spirit —</l>
       <l n="116">And that seems to me unlikely .</l>
       <l n="117">As you 've just enjoyed your breakfast —</l>
       <l n="118">Then the Baron sends you greeting ,</l>
       <l n="119">And invites you to his castle .</l>
       <l n="120">I will take you there with pleasure . ”</l>
       <l n="121">Thus he spoke . Young Werner listened ,</l>
       <l n="122">Half astonished , and went with him .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="123">Smirking , thought the cunning landlord :</l>
       <l n="124">“ You will get it , my young master ;</l>
       <l n="125">You believed you had full freedom</l>
       <l n="126">Thus to rove about the river ,</l>
       <l n="127">Spying out long-buried treasures .</l>
       <l n="128">But the Baron found you out soon ,</l>
       <l n="129">And will stop your bold proceedings .</l>
       <l n="130">Now you 'll get it , when he treats you ,</l>
       <l n="131">From his amply-furnished stores , to</l>
       <l n="132">Some of his well-seasoned curses .</l>
       <l n="133">Like a top your head will spin then ,</l>
       <l n="134">And your ears buzz like a beehive .</l>
       <l n="135">But this will concern you solely .</l>
       <l n="136">If he keep you in a dungeon</l>
       <l n="137">Of your horse I 'll take possession ;</l>
       <l n="138">It will well score off your reckoning . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="139">Once more in the hall together</l>
       <l n="140">Were the Baron and his daughter ,</l>
       <l n="141">And again he smoked his pipe there ,</l>
       <l n="142">When the ponderous folding-doors were</l>
       <l n="143">Opened , and , with modest reverence ,</l>
       <l n="144">Werner entered . “ If you only , ”</l>
       <l n="145">Said the faithful Anton , “ only</l>
       <l n="146">Knew , your gracious lordship , what a</l>
       <l n="147">Heavy task it was to find him ! ”</l>
       <l n="148">Keenly did the Baron 's eyes rest</l>
       <l n="149">On young Werner , passing muster ;</l>
       <l n="150">By her father , lightly leaning</l>
       <l n="151">On his arm-chair , Margaretta</l>
       <l n="152">Bashfully looked at the stranger ,</l>
       <l n="153">And with both the first impression</l>
       <l n="154">Of each other was most happy .</l>
       <l n="155">“ It is you , then , ” said the Baron ,</l>
       <l n="156">“ Who last night have startled us here</l>
       <l n="157">With your trumpet-blowing , therefore</l>
       <l n="158">I should like to speak to you now . ”</l>
       <l n="159">“ This commences well , ” thought Werner ,</l>
       <l n="160">And , embarrassed , cast his eyes down</l>
       <l n="161">To the ground . But the old Baron ,</l>
       <l n="162">Kindly smiling , thus continued :</l>
       <l n="163">“ You believe , perhaps , I shall now</l>
       <l n="164">Call you to account for having</l>
       <l n="165">Made loud music near the castle ?</l>
       <l n="166">You are wrong , ‘ tis not my business ;</l>
       <l n="167">For no license is here needed</l>
       <l n="168">On the Rhine ; if anybody</l>
       <l n="169">Wants to catch a cold by playing</l>
       <l n="170">Late at night there , he may do so .</l>
       <l n="171">No , I only wish to ask you ,</l>
       <l n="172">Whether you would like here often</l>
       <l n="173">As last night to blow the trumpet ?</l>
       <l n="174">But I fear I am mistaken .</l>
       <l n="175">You are not by trade a player ,</l>
       <l n="176">May be one of those damned scribblers ,</l>
       <l n="177">Secretary to a foreign</l>
       <l n="178">Embassy , as many are now</l>
       <l n="179">Coaching all about the country ,</l>
       <l n="180">Just to spoil all that the soldier 's</l>
       <l n="181">Ready sword had once accomplished ? ”</l>
       <l n="182">“ Not bad either , ” thought young Werner ;</l>
       <l n="183">Still he liked the Baron 's manner .</l>
       <l n="184">“ I am no professional player , ”</l>
       <l n="185">Said he , “ and still less a scribbler .</l>
       <l n="186">As for my part , all the inkstands</l>
       <l n="187">In the Holy Roman Empire</l>
       <l n="188">Might dry up without my caring .</l>
       <l n="189">I am not in any service ,</l>
       <l n="190">But as my own lord and master</l>
       <l n="191">I am travelling for my pleasure ,</l>
       <l n="192">And await whatever fortune</l>
       <l n="193">On my pathway may be blooming . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="194">“ Very good , then , ” said the Baron .</l>
       <l n="195">“ If it stands thus , you may well hear</l>
       <l n="196">Everything I have to tell you ;</l>
       <l n="197">But before we go on farther ,</l>
       <l n="198">With old wine it must be seasoned . ”</l>
       <l n="199">Cleverly his thoughts divining ,</l>
       <l n="200">Margaretta , from the cellar ,</l>
       <l n="201">Now brought up two dusty bottles</l>
       <l n="202">Which , with spider-webs all covered ,</l>
       <l n="203">In the sand had lain half-buried ;</l>
       <l n="204">Brought with them two fine-cut goblets ,</l>
       <l n="205">Which she filled and then presented .</l>
       <l n="206">“ This wine ripened long before the</l>
       <l n="207">War raged in our German country , ”</l>
       <l n="208">Said the Baron . “ ‘ Tis a famous</l>
       <l n="209">Choice old wine which grew at Grenzach .</l>
       <l n="210">Brightly in the glass it sparkles ,</l>
       <l n="211">Like pure gold its colour shineth ,</l>
       <l n="212">And a fragrance rises from it</l>
       <l n="213">Like the finest greenhouse flowers .</l>
       <l n="214">Master Trumpeter , ring glasses ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="215">Loudly then rang both their goblets .</l>
       <l n="216">Emptying his , the Baron spun out</l>
       <l n="217">Farther still the conversation .</l>
       <l n="218">“ My young friend , you know , as long as</l>
       <l n="219">This world lasts , there will be people</l>
       <l n="220">Who are fond of hobby-horses .</l>
       <l n="221">Some are mystics and ascetics ,</l>
       <l n="222">Others love old wine or brandy .</l>
       <l n="223">Some , antiquities are seeking ,</l>
       <l n="224">Others are for chafers craving ;</l>
       <l n="225">Many others make bad verses .</l>
       <l n="226">‘ Tis a curious joke that each one</l>
       <l n="227">Much prefers to choose a calling</l>
       <l n="228">Most unsuited to his nature .</l>

       <l n="232">As King Saul 's deep sorrow vanished</l>
       <l n="233">At the sound of David 's harp once ,</l>
       <l n="234">So with cheering sounds of music</l>
       <l n="235">Do I banish age 's inroads</l>
       <l n="236">And the gout , my old disturber .</l>
       <l n="237">When sometimes in tempo presto</l>

       <l n="184">That no poachers should disturb it ,</l>
       <l n="185">Who might come along at midnight ,</l>
       <l n="186">And employ it for their fishing .</l>
       <l n="187">From its hiding-place they dragged it</l>
       <l n="188">Onward to the lake-shore , and there</l>
       <l n="189">Placed the heavy net within it .</l>
       <l n="190">Closely netted were the meshes</l>
       <l n="191">Of the coarsest twine , while many</l>
       <l n="192">Leaden weights thereon were fastened .</l>
       <l n="193">When they tried the boat for leakage ,</l>
       <l n="194">Although somewhat out of order ,</l>
       <l n="195">They pronounced it quite seaworthy .</l>
       <l n="196">Now the landlord and five comrades ,</l>
       <l n="197">Gay and hopeful , took their places ,</l>
       <l n="198">And one end of the great net threw</l>
       <l n="199">To some friends on shore remaining ,</l>
       <l n="200">With the charge to hold it tightly .</l>
       <l n="201">From the shore they pushed away now ,</l>
       <l n="202">Rowing stoutly as the net sank</l>
       <l n="203">Slowly down in a wide curve ;</l>
       <l n="204">Then returned with speed much lessened ,</l>
       <l n="205">Always dragging on the heavy</l>
       <l n="206">Bulky net , so that the fishes</l>
       <l n="207">Might therein become entangled .</l>
       <l n="208">On the shore they sprang out quickly ,</l>
       <l n="209">And drew after them the netting ,</l>
       <l n="210">Till they nigh approached those friends who</l>
       <l n="211">Still upon the shore were waiting .</l>
       <l n="212">Stoutly pulling back the ends , they</l>
       <l n="213">Raised the net out of the water ,</l>
       <l n="214">In great hopes of lots of booty .</l>
       <l n="215">But within itself entangled</l>
       <l n="216">It came slowly to the surface</l>
       <l n="217">Empty : some unskilful rower</l>
       <l n="218">Had prevented it from sinking ,</l>
       <l n="219">And the dwellers of the lake laughed</l>
       <l n="220">To have just escaped such danger .</l>
       <l n="221">Now the landlord cast sharp glances</l>
       <l n="222">Over all the meshes . Nothing</l>
       <l n="223">Met his anxious gaze but water ;</l>
       <l n="224">Not the smallest fish was caught there ;</l>
       <l n="225">Only an old boot half rotten ,</l>
       <l n="226">And a toad half crushed and flattened ,</l>
       <l n="227">Which with eyes protruding oddly</l>
       <l n="228">Looked upon the sunlit forest ,</l>
       <l n="229">And the human faces round him ,</l>
       <l n="230">And he thought : “ It is most truly</l>
       <l n="231">Wonderful , how anybody</l>
       <l n="232">Ever can enjoy existence ,</l>
       <l n="233">With this sky and this bright sunlight !</l>
       <l n="234">Well , it seems to me no one here</l>
       <l n="235">E'er can have the slightest notion</l>
       <l n="236">Of the mud and all its splendour .</l>
       <l n="237">Would I were in my own element ! ”</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="238">Those who stood upon the lake-shore</l>
       <l n="239">Raised a long and roaring laughter</l>
       <l n="240">At these first-fruits of the fishing .</l>
       <l n="241">But in rage broke out the landlord ,</l>
       <l n="242">O'er their laughter rang his scolding :</l>
       <l n="243">“ Stupid fellows , bunglers , numskulls ! ”</l>
       <l n="244">And with angry kicks he sent then</l>
       <l n="245">All the booty flying swiftly ,</l>
       <l n="246">Boot and toad in peace together</l>
       <l n="247">To the water where they came from .</l>
       <l n="248">Loudly splashing they sank downward .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="249">But the disappointed fishers</l>
       <l n="250">Would again now try their fortune ,</l>
       <l n="251">Loosened all the tangled meshes ,</l>
       <l n="252">And with greatest care they lowered</l>
       <l n="253">Then the net and raised it slowly .</l>
       <l n="254">And to do so there were needed</l>
       <l n="255">Many sturdy pulls and struggles .</l>
       <l n="256">Ringing shouts and cries of triumph</l>
       <l n="257">Greeted this successful fishing .</l>
       <l n="258">From the rock came down the Baron</l>
       <l n="259">To the fishers , and the ladies</l>
       <l n="260">Eagerly made haste to follow .</l>
       <l n="261">Over rocks and thorny brambles</l>
       <l n="262">To the shore they found a pathway .</l>
       <l n="263">Margaretta followed also ,</l>
       <l n="264">Notwithstanding her long habit .</l>
       <l n="265">When young Werner saw her coming ,</l>
       <l n="266">Bashfully his arm he offered ,</l>
       <l n="267">And bewildered were his senses .</l>
       <l n="268">So Sir Walter Raleigh 's heart once</l>
       <l n="269">Must have beaten , when his mantle</l>
       <l n="270">He made use of as a carpet</l>
       <l n="271">For his gracious royal mistress .</l>
       <l n="272">Yet with thanks fair Margaretta</l>
       <l n="273">Werner 's arm and aid accepted .</l>

       <l n="277">Masters of the ceremonies .</l>
       <l n="278">The descent there was not easy ,</l>

       <l n="283">Were the captives . Many snapping</l>
       <l n="284">Sought a way still for escaping ,</l>
       <l n="285">But on the bare sand were landed ;</l>
       <l n="286">And thus fruitless was their trial .</l>
       <l n="287">Those who felt toward each other</l>
       <l n="288">In the depths such bitter hatred ,</l>
       <l n="289">Now as captives were quite peaceful :</l>

       <l n="294">As in war , the harmless peasants</l>
       <l n="295">Often to stray shots fall victims ,</l>
       <l n="296">So the fate of being captured</l>
       <l n="297">Many others overtook :</l>

       <l n="300">And through all this crowd of fishes</l>
       <l n="301">Sluggishly the crab was creeping ;</l>
       <l n="302">Inwardly he sadly grumbled :</l>

       <l n="310">To these words they all assented ,</l>
       <l n="311">And the landlord of the “ Button ”</l>
       <l n="312">Sent out two fleet-footed fellows</l>

       <l n="318">Bring me lemons too , and sugar ;</l>
       <l n="319">For I feel a premonition</l>
       <l n="320">As if May-drink would be wanted . ”</l>
       <l n="321">Off they started . Under shelter</l>
       <l n="322">Of a rock with a tall pine-tree ,</l>
       <l n="323">Some the hearth were getting ready ,</l>
       <l n="324">Bringing there dry boughs and fagots ,</l>
       <l n="325">Loads of furze and moss together .</l>
       <l n="326">Others now prepared the fishes</l>
       <l n="327">For the feast , and all the ladies</l>
       <l n="328">Gathered herbs of spicy fragrance ,</l>
       <l n="329">Such as thyme and leaves of strawberries ;</l>
       <l n="330">Also gathered for the May-wine</l>
       <l n="331">The white-blooming fragrant woodroof .</l>
       <l n="332">Which rejoiced at being broken</l>
       <l n="333">By such tender hands , and thought thus :</l>
       <l n="334">“ Sweet it was in these dark pine-woods ,</l>
       <l n="335">To be blooming , ‘ mid the rocks here ,</l>
       <l n="336">But still sweeter in the May-time</l>
       <l n="337">‘ Tis to die , and with the last breath</l>
       <l n="338">Highly then to spice the May-wine</l>
       <l n="339">For the joy of human beings .</l>
       <l n="340">Death in general is corruption ,</l>
       <l n="341">But the woodroof 's death is like that</l>
       <l n="342">Of the morning-dew on blossoms ,</l>
       <l n="343">Sweetly , without sighs , exhaling . ”</l>
       <l n="344">From the town returning quickly</l>
       <l n="345">Came the two fleet-footed fellows ,</l>

      <head>THE CONCERT IN THE GARDEN PAVILION .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">In the garden of the castle</l>
       <l n="2">Mighty chestnut trees are standing ,</l>
       <l n="3">And a pretty gay pavilion .</l>
       <l n="4">In the Rhine are deeply sunken</l>
       <l n="5">The foundations of the terrace .</l>
       <l n="6">‘ Tis a quiet cosy corner ,</l>
       <l n="7">Hidden by a mass of foliage .</l>
       <l n="8">While below the waves are murmuring .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">For the last two months , mysterious</l>
       <l n="10">Business has been going on here .</l>
       <l n="11">Pots of colours , painting brushes ,</l>
       <l n="12">Lime and mortar , masons ’ trowels</l>
       <l n="13">And high scaffoldings are rising</l>
       <l n="14">To the dome of the pavilion .</l>
       <l n="15">Is't some evil spirit 's workshop ?—</l>
       <l n="16">‘ Tis no evil spirit 's workshop .</l>
       <l n="17">Frescoes here are being painted ,</l>
       <l n="18">And the legs which there are dangling</l>
       <l n="19">From the lofty wooden scaffold ,</l>
       <l n="20">Are the legs of the illustrious</l>
       <l n="21">Fresco-painter Fludribus ,</l>
       <l n="22">Who returning from Italia</l>
       <l n="23">Had been living in the Rhine-land .</l>
       <l n="24">He was pleased with the fair country ,</l>
       <l n="25">And the rosy happy faces ,</l>
       <l n="26">And the cellars full of wine .</l>
       <l n="27">All the people wondered at him</l>
       <l n="28">As they would at an enchanter ;</l>
       <l n="29">For he told them marvellous stories .</l>
       <l n="30">In his youth he had been travelling ,</l>
       <l n="31">And by chance once in Bologna</l>
       <l n="32">Came upon the school of artists .</l>
       <l n="33">In the studio of Albini</l>
       <l n="34">He became a colour-mixer ;</l>
       <l n="35">And from this most graceful master</l>
       <l n="36">He found out with ready cunning</l>
       <l n="37">How to paint both gods and heroes ,</l>
       <l n="38">And the airy little cupids .</l>
       <l n="39">Yes , he even helped the master ,</l>
       <l n="40">Making easy light gradations ,</l>
       <l n="41">Or preparing the dead colouring .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="42">On the Rhine , far round the country</l>
       <l n="43">Fludribus was the sole artist .</l>
       <l n="44">Painted many tavern sign-boards ,</l>
       <l n="45">Pictures also for the chapels ,</l>
       <l n="46">Portraits e'en of brides of peasants .</l>
       <l n="47">Stable was his reputation ;</l>
       <l n="48">For if any criticisers</l>
       <l n="49">Would find fault with his great paintings ,</l>
       <l n="50">That an arm or nose was crooked ,</l>
       <l n="51">Or a cheek looked too much swollen ,</l>
       <l n="52">Then he would overwhelm his critics</l>
       <l n="53">With the big high-sounding phrases</l>
       <l n="54">He had learnt when at Bologna .</l>
       <l n="55">Hearing nothing but perspective ,</l>
       <l n="56">Colouring and soft gradation ,</l>
       <l n="57">Modelling and bold foreshortening ,</l>
       <l n="58">Soon they lost their wits entirely .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="59">Margaretta , who with faithful</l>
       <l n="60">Love had long the matter pondered ,</l>
       <l n="61">How she would surprise her father</l>
       <l n="62">With a pleasure on his birthday ,</l>
       <l n="63">Spoke to Master Fludribus :</l>
       <l n="64">“ I have heard it oft related</l>
       <l n="65">How in France in lordly castles</l>
       <l n="66">They adorn the walls with frescoes .</l>
       <l n="67">Therefore try to paint now something</l>
       <l n="68">Like them here in my pavilion .</l>
       <l n="69">From the world secluded , I know</l>
       <l n="70">Naught about such compositions ;</l>
       <l n="71">Therefore to your taste I leave all ,</l>
       <l n="72">Only you must work in secret ,</l>
       <l n="73">As the Baron must know nothing . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="74">Fludribus looked consequential :</l>
       <l n="75">“ Though but trifling is the order ,</l>
       <l n="76">Still I coincide with Caesar ,</l>
       <l n="77">And am rather here considered</l>
       <l n="78">First than at great Rome the second .</l>
       <l n="79">And besides , there all is finished .</l>
       <l n="80">Even in the Pope 's own palace</l>
       <l n="81">All those thoughts high and aesthetic ,</l>
       <l n="82">Which I in my bosom cherished ,</l>
       <l n="83">Has a man by name of Raphael</l>
       <l n="84">Painted on the walls already .</l>
       <l n="85">But I shall great things achieve ,</l>
       <l n="86">And shall do like Buffamalco ,</l>
       <l n="87">Who with rich red wine imparted</l>
       <l n="88">Glowing warmth to the cold colours .</l>
       <l n="89">Therefore , furnish me with red wine</l>
       <l n="90">First ; of course , good eating with it .</l>
       <l n="91">Rich reward I do not care for ,</l>
       <l n="92">Since the thought is my enjoyment ,</l>
       <l n="93">That I shall be made immortal</l>
       <l n="94">Through the efforts of my genius .</l>
       <l n="95">Thus I 'll paint for almost nothing ,</l>
       <l n="96">Just the square foot seven shillings . ”</l>

       <l n="97">Since two months he had been painting</l>
       <l n="98">On the walls beneath the arched roof ;</l>
       <l n="99">Imitated Buffamalco ;</l>
       <l n="100">But he drank himself the red wine .</l>
       <l n="101">And his compositions truly</l>
       <l n="102">Were artistic , highly proper ,</l>
       <l n="103">And of elegant conception .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="104">To begin with : there paraded</l>
       <l n="105">Perseus and Andromeda ;</l>
       <l n="106">At their feet lay deadly wounded</l>
       <l n="107">The great Hydra , with a handsome</l>
       <l n="108">Face , much like a human being ,</l>
       <l n="109">Who in dying still coquetted</l>
       <l n="110">With the lovely rock-bound captive .</l>
       <l n="111">Then the Judgment came of Paris ;</l>
       <l n="112">And in order that the dazzling</l>
       <l n="113">Beauty of those heavenly ladies</l>
       <l n="114">Should not quite eclipse the hero ,</l>
       <l n="115">They looked off toward the landscape ,</l>
       <l n="116">With their backs to the spectator .</l>
       <l n="117">Similar were the other pictures :</l>
       <l n="118">As Diana and Actaeon ,</l>
       <l n="119">Orpheus and Eurydice .</l>
       <l n="120">For the man of genius chooses</l>
       <l n="121">From mythology his subjects ;</l>
       <l n="122">And he thinks , in nudeness only ,</l>
       <l n="123">Is revealed the highest beauty .</l>
       <l n="124">Now the work was all accomplished ,</l>
       <l n="125">And with feeling , said the master :</l>
       <l n="126">“ Happy can I go to Hades ,</l>
       <l n="127">As my works are my memorial .</l>
       <l n="128">In the history of this Rhine-land</l>
       <l n="129">A new epoch of the fine arts</l>
       <l n="130">Will begin with Fludribus . ”</l>

       <l n="131">‘ Twas the wish of Margaretta</l>
       <l n="132">To inaugurate with music</l>
       <l n="133">This so beautified pavilion .</l>
       <l n="134">Ha ! how Werner 's heart was beating ,</l>
       <l n="135">When he heard the maid 's desire .</l>
       <l n="136">He directly went to Basel</l>
       <l n="137">To select the new productions</l>
       <l n="138">Of the musical composers ;</l>
       <l n="139">And he brought the scores back with him</l>
       <l n="140">Of the great Venetian master ,</l>
       <l n="141">Claudio di Monteverde ,</l>
       <l n="142">Whose sweet pastoral composition</l>
       <l n="143">Carried off the prize in music .</l>
       <l n="144">Then there was a noisy bustle</l>
       <l n="145">‘ Mongst the artists of the city ;</l>
       <l n="146">And a most increasing practice</l>
       <l n="147">In the frequent long rehearsals ,</l>
       <l n="148">All unnoticed by the Baron .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="149">Now , at last , the long-expected</l>
       <l n="150">Day had come , the Baron 's birthday .</l>
       <l n="151">At the table he was chatting</l>
       <l n="152">With his friend and pleasant neighbour ,</l>
       <l n="153">The good prelate of St. Blasien ,</l>
       <l n="154">Who had driven hither early ,</l>
       <l n="155">To express his heartfelt wishes .</l>
       <l n="156">Meanwhile many hands were busy</l>
       <l n="157">Decorating the pavilion</l>
       <l n="158">With fresh garlands , and were placing</l>
       <l n="159">Rows of music-desks in order .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="160">By degrees there came now gliding</l>
       <l n="161">Through the side-gate by the river</l>
       <l n="162">All the musical performers .</l>
       <l n="163">First , the youthful burgomaster</l>
       <l n="164">Bending under the unwieldy</l>
       <l n="165">Contra-bass , whose sounds sonorous</l>
       <l n="166">Often from his thoughts did banish</l>
       <l n="167">All the cares of his high office ,</l>
       <l n="168">And the council 's stupid blunders .</l>
       <l n="169">Next there came the bloated chaplain</l>
       <l n="170">Who played finely on the violin ,</l>
       <l n="171">Drawing from it such shrill wailings ,</l>
       <l n="172">As if wishing to give utterance</l>
       <l n="173">To his lonely bachelor 's heart .</l>
       <l n="174">With his horn beneath his arm came</l>
       <l n="175">The receiver 's clerk , who often ,</l>
       <l n="176">A great bore to his superior ,</l>
       <l n="177">With his playing did enliven</l>
       <l n="178">All the dry accounts he summed up ,</l>
       <l n="179">And the dulness of subtraction .</l>
       <l n="180">There came also stepping slowly ,</l>
       <l n="181">Dressed in black , but shabby looking ,</l>
       <l n="182">With a hat the worse for usage ,</l>
       <l n="183">He the lank assistant-teacher ,</l>
       <l n="184">Who by Art consoled himself for</l>
       <l n="185">What was wanting in his income ,</l>
       <l n="186">And instead of wine and roast beef</l>
       <l n="187">Lived upon his flute 's sweet music .</l>
       <l n="188">Then came — Who can count , however ,</l>
       <l n="189">All these instrumental players ?</l>
       <l n="190">All the talent of the city</l>
       <l n="191">For this concert had united .</l>
       <l n="192">From the ironworks of Albbruck</l>
       <l n="193">Even came the superintendent ;</l>
       <l n="194">He alone played the viola .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="195">Like a troop of mounted warriors</l>
       <l n="196">Who the enemy expecting ,</l>
       <l n="197">Lurk in safe and hidden ambush ,</l>
       <l n="198">So they waited for the Baron</l>
       <l n="199">To arrive . And like good marksmen</l>
       <l n="200">Who with care before the battle</l>
       <l n="201">Try their weapons , if their powder</l>
       <l n="202">By the dew has not been damaged ,</l>
       <l n="203">If the flint is good for striking ;</l>
       <l n="204">So by blowing , scraping , tuning ,</l>
       <l n="205">They their instruments were trying .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="206">Margaretta led the Baron</l>
       <l n="207">And his guest now to the garden .</l>
       <l n="208">Women never are in want of</l>
       <l n="209">A good pretext , when some fun or</l>
       <l n="210">Some surprise they are preparing .</l>
       <l n="211">So she praised the shady coolness</l>
       <l n="212">And the view from the pavilion ,</l>
       <l n="213">Till the two old friends were turning</l>
       <l n="214">Toward that spot without suspicion .</l>
       <l n="215">Like a volley then resounded</l>
       <l n="216">At their entrance a loud flourish ,</l>
       <l n="217">Every instrument saluting ;</l>
       <l n="218">And like roaring torrents bursting</l>
       <l n="219">Wildly through the gaping sluice-gate ,</l>
       <l n="220">So the overture let loose now</l>
       <l n="221">Its loud storming floods of music</l>
       <l n="222">On the much astonished hearers .</l>
       <l n="223">With the greatest skill young Werner</l>
       <l n="224">Led the orchestra , whose chorus</l>
       <l n="225">Gladly yielded to his baton .</l>
       <l n="226">Ha ! that was a splendid bowing ,</l>
       <l n="227">Such a fiddling , such a pealing !</l>
       <l n="228">Hopping lightly , like a locust ,</l>
       <l n="229">Through the din the clarinet flew ,</l>
       <l n="230">And the contra-bass kept groaning ,</l>
       <l n="231">As if wailing for its soul ,</l>
       <l n="232">While the player 's brow was sweating</l>
       <l n="233">From his arduous performance .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="234">There behind in the orchestra</l>
       <l n="235">Fludribus the drum was beating ;</l>
       <l n="236">As a many-sided genius ,</l>
       <l n="237">During pauses , he was also</l>
       <l n="238">To the triangle attending .</l>
       <l n="239">But his heart o'erflowed with sadness ;</l>
       <l n="240">And the drum 's dull sound re-echoed</l>
       <l n="241">His complaints , as dull and grumbling :</l>
       <l n="242">“ Dilettanti , happy people !</l>
       <l n="243">Merrily they suck the honey</l>
       <l n="244">From the flowers which with heavy</l>
       <l n="245">Throes the Master 's mind created ;</l>
       <l n="246">And they spice well their enjoyment</l>
       <l n="247">With their mutual frequent blunders .</l>
       <l n="248">Genuine Art is a titanic</l>
       <l n="249">Heaven-storming strife and struggle</l>
       <l n="250">For a Beauty still receding ,</l>
       <l n="251">While the soul is gnawed with longing</l>
       <l n="252">For the unattained Ideal .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="254">Now the din of sound subsided .</l>

       <l n="258">‘ Gainst the canopy of heaven ;</l>
       <l n="259">So now the full band is followed</l>
       <l n="260">By the trumpet 's dulcet solo .</l>
       <l n="261">Werner blew it : low and melting</l>
       <l n="262">Rang the tunes forth from the trumpet .</l>
       <l n="263">Full of wonder some were staring</l>
       <l n="264">At the score , in wonder also</l>
       <l n="265">The fat chaplain nudged the teacher</l>
       <l n="266">On the arm , and whispered softly :</l>
       <l n="267">“ Hear'st thou what he 's playing ? Nothing</l>
       <l n="268">Like it in the score is written .</l>
       <l n="269">Has he read perhaps his music</l>

       <l n="271">Splendidly the concert came thus</l>
       <l n="272">To an end , and the musicians</l>
       <l n="273">Sat exhausted and yet happy</l>
       <l n="274">That they had so well succeeded .</l>
       <l n="275">Now the prelate of St. Blasien</l>

       <l n="280">On our land while war was raging ,</l>
       <l n="281">And throughout our German country</l>
       <l n="282">Rudeness was predominating .</l>

       <l n="214">And the stroke remained , like German</l>
       <l n="215">Unity and other projects ,</l>
       <l n="216">Only an ideal dream .</l>
       <l n="217">Then beheld he Margaretta</l>
       <l n="218">Pressing to her lips the trumpet ,</l>
       <l n="219">And her rosy cheeks are puffed out</l>
       <l n="220">Like those trumpet-blowing angels ’</l>
       <l n="221">In the church of Fridolinus .</l>
       <l n="222">Up she starts now as a thief would</l>
       <l n="223">In the neighbour 's yard detected ,</l>
       <l n="224">And the trumpet drops abruptly</l>
       <l n="225">From the touch of her soft lips .</l>
       <l n="226">Werner covered her confusion</l>
       <l n="227">Through a clever maze of language ;</l>
       <l n="228">And with ardour he commences</l>
       <l n="229">On the spot to teach the maiden</l>
       <l n="230">The first steps in trumpet-blowing</l>
       <l n="231">In strict order , with due method ;</l>
       <l n="232">Shows the instrument 's construction ,</l>
       <l n="233">How to use the lips in blowing ,</l>
       <l n="234">That true tones may be forthcoming .</l>
       <l n="235">Margaretta listened docile .</l>
       <l n="236">And before she is aware , new</l>
       <l n="237">Tones she finds she is awaking</l>
       <l n="238">From the trumpet which young Werner</l>
       <l n="239">With low bows had handed to her .</l>
       <l n="240">Easily from him she learneth</l>
       <l n="241">What her father 's cuirassiers blew</l>
       <l n="242">As the call to charge in battle ;</l>
       <l n="243">Only a few notes and simple ,</l>
       <l n="244">But most pithy and inspiring .</l>

       <l n="254">Happy teacher , happy scholar ,</l>

       <l n="263">True , a song without the words yet ,</l>
       <l n="264">But they had divined its meaning ,</l>
       <l n="265">And beneath a playful manner</l>
       <l n="266">Hid the blissful consciousness ,</l>
       <l n="267">Startled by this trumpet-blowing</l>
       <l n="268">Came the Baron reconnoitring ,</l>
       <l n="269">Tried to frown , but soon his anger</l>
       <l n="270">Was converted into pleasure ,</l>
       <l n="271">When he heard his child there blowing</l>
       <l n="272">The old fanfar of his horsemen .</l>
       <l n="273">Friendly spoke he to young Werner :</l>
       <l n="274">“ You are truly in your office</l>

       <l n="4">In the narrow valley standeth</l>
       <l n="5">‘ Midst the rocks a single fir-tree ;</l>
       <l n="6">In the branches sat the haggard</l>
       <l n="7">Wicked wood-sprite Meysenhartus ,</l>
       <l n="8">Who to-day behaved quite badly :</l>

       <l n="12">Clambered often quite indignant</l>
       <l n="13">Up and down just like a squirrel ;</l>
       <l n="14">From the wings of a poor night-owl</l>
       <l n="15">Roughly plucked out several feathers ;</l>
       <l n="16">And while mocking the old fir-tree</l>

       <l n="38">For thy old home in the forest ,</l>

       <l n="80">From the hill came Master Werner .</l>

       <l n="83">And as far as man is happy</l>
       <l n="84">Here below , he was ; and buoyant</l>
       <l n="85">Hope and joy his heart were filling .</l>
       <l n="86">Many burning thoughts were passing</l>
       <l n="87">Through his brain , as if they shortly</l>

       <l n="95">‘ Stead of river-ward went inland .</l>

       <l n="100">Werner paying no attention ,</l>
       <l n="101">Went up through the Hasel valley ,</l>

       <l n="103">To a corner cool and shady .</l>
       <l n="104">Holly , sloe , and climbing ivy</l>
       <l n="105">Grew around the rocks luxuriant ,</l>
       <l n="106">While near by a clear spring rippled .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="107">Through the bushes stepped young Werner</l>

       <l n="109">Strongly tangled was the brushwood ,</l>
       <l n="110">And upon it he trod firmly .</l>
       <l n="111">Then upon his ear broke squeaking</l>
       <l n="112">Wailing tones , as from a mole which</l>
       <l n="113">At his subterranean labour</l>
       <l n="114">Caught in traps and now detected ,</l>
       <l n="115">Roughly is jerked up to daylight .</l>
       <l n="116">From the grass rose something crackling ;</l>
       <l n="117">Lo , there stood a gray-clad pygmy ,</l>
       <l n="118">Hardly three feet high , and hunchbacked ;</l>
       <l n="119">But his face was clear and gentle ,</l>
       <l n="120">And his odd small eyes looked clever .</l>
       <l n="121">Gracefully he let the long ends</l>
       <l n="122">Of his garment on the ground trail ,</l>
       <l n="123">And said , limping : “ Sir , you have been</l>
       <l n="124">Treading on my foot most rudely . ”</l>
       <l n="125">Said young Werner : “ I am sorry . ”</l>
       <l n="126">Now the pygmy : “ And what business</l>
       <l n="127">Have you in our vale at all ? ”</l>
       <l n="128">Said young Werner : “ I by no means</l>

       <l n="322">For the man I felt great pity ,</l>

       <l n="325">All the gnomes ’ incessant labours ;</l>
       <l n="326">And directly felt at home here .</l>
       <l n="327">Oft together have we listened</l>
       <l n="328">To the growing of stalactites ,</l>
       <l n="329">Chatted also many evenings</l>
       <l n="330">Of the things below us hidden ;</l>
       <l n="331">Only when my conversation</l>
       <l n="332">Turned to men , he grew quite angry ;</l>
       <l n="333">Dark his frowns were , and he broke once</l>
       <l n="334">Seven columns in his fury .</l>
       <l n="335">When I wished to praise the sunlight</l>
       <l n="336">And the skies , he stopped me , saying :</l>

       <l n="351">But he gradually grew silent .</l>
       <l n="352">Did I ask him what he wanted ,</l>
       <l n="353">Then he smiling took my hand :</l>

       <l n="374">Fit to take away one 's hearing .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="23">
       <l n="375">On the jutting turret standing .</l>

       <l n="378">Toward that way : “ Good heaven ! ” said he ,</l>
       <l n="379">“ In the garden is the enemy . ”</l>
       <l n="380">Quick his signal-shot brought other</l>
       <l n="381">Men-at-arms , along with Werner ,</l>
       <l n="382">Who placed quickly his few fighters :</l>
       <l n="383">“ Stand thou here — thou there — do n't hurry</l>
       <l n="384">With your fire ! ” His heart beat wildly :</l>
       <l n="385">“ Ha , my sword , maintain thy valour ! ”</l>
       <l n="386">Shallow was the castle 's moat then ,</l>
       <l n="387">Well-nigh dry , and ‘ mid the rushes</l>
       <l n="388">Glisten many swords and spear-heads .</l>
       <l n="389">Daring men are climbing upward</l>
       <l n="390">O'er the tower 's crumbling stone-work .</l>
       <l n="391">Muskets cracking , arrows flying .</l>
       <l n="392">Axe-strokes ‘ gainst the gate are ringing ,</l>
       <l n="393">Everywhere attack , and shouting :</l>
       <l n="394">“ Castle thou wilt soon be taken ! ”</l>
       <l n="395">And between , the fall of bodies</l>
       <l n="396">In the moat is heard — much blood flows .</l>
       <l n="397">By the gate cries out young Werner :</l>
       <l n="398">“ Well done , Anton ! Now take aim at</l>

       <l n="418">“ When the sword gets dull , thou rascal ,</l>
       <l n="419">With my fist alone I 'll kill thee . ”</l>

       <l n="430">Werner 's stroke : “ Not badly done , lad !</l>

       <l n="433">Showed a deep wound from the halberd .</l>
       <l n="434">But the one who swung it , never</l>

       <l n="437">Being cut by Werner 's weapon .</l>
       <l n="438">Three steps backward then he staggered</l>
       <l n="439">Sinking : “ Devil , stir thy fire !</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">In the castle 's chapel dimly</l>
       <l n="2">Was a flickering lamp-light burning ,</l>
       <l n="3">Shining on the altar-picture ,</l>
       <l n="4">Whence the Queen of Heaven looked down</l>
       <l n="5">With a gracious pitying smile ,</l>
       <l n="6">‘ Neath the picture hung fresh gathered</l>
       <l n="7">Roses and geranium-garlands .</l>
       <l n="8">Kneeling there prayed Margaretta :</l>
       <l n="9">“ Sorely tried one , full of mercy !</l>
       <l n="10">Thou who givest us protection ,</l>
       <l n="11">Care for him who badly wounded</l>
       <l n="12">Lies now on a bed of anguish ;</l>
       <l n="13">And bestow on me forgiveness</l>
       <l n="14">If thou thinkst it very sinful</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="16">Hope and trust their light were shedding</l>
       <l n="17">In her heart as thus she prayed .</l>
       <l n="18">And more cheerful Margaretta</l>
       <l n="19">Now ascended up the staircase .</l>
       <l n="20">On the threshold of the sick-room</l>
       <l n="21">Was the gray old doctor standing ,</l>
       <l n="22">And he beckoned her to come there .</l>
       <l n="23">Judging what most likely would be</l>
       <l n="24">The first question she would ask him ,</l>
       <l n="25">He then said with voice half muffled :</l>
       <l n="26">“ Fear no more , my gracious lady ;</l>
       <l n="27">Fresh young blood and youthful vigour</l>
       <l n="28">From such wounds not long can suffer ,</l>

       <l n="32">Spoke and left ; for , his attention</l>
       <l n="33">Many wounded men were craving ,</l>
       <l n="34">And he hated useless gossip .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="35">Softly entered Margaretta</l>
       <l n="36">Now the sick-room of young Werner ,</l>
       <l n="37">Bashful and yet curious whether</l>
       <l n="38">All was true the doctor told her .</l>
       <l n="39">Gently slumbering lay young Werner ,</l>
       <l n="40">Pale in youthful beauty , looking</l>
       <l n="41">Like a statue . As if dreaming ,</l>
       <l n="42">He lay holding , o'er his forehead</l>
       <l n="43">And his healing wound , his right hand ,</l>
       <l n="44">As one who from glaring sunlight</l>
       <l n="45">Wishes to protect his eyes ;</l>
       <l n="46">Round his lips a smile was playing .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="47">Long on him gazed Margaretta —</l>

       <l n="50">Gazed the goddess , fair Diana ,</l>
       <l n="51">On Endymion the sleeper .</l>
       <l n="52">Pity held her eye a captive ;</l>
       <l n="53">Ah , and pity is a fruitful</l>
       <l n="54">Soil for love 's sweet plant to grow in .</l>
       <l n="55">From a tiny seed ‘ tis spreading</l>
       <l n="56">In this ground so rich and fertile ,</l>
       <l n="57">Which it permeates completely</l>
       <l n="58">With its thousand fibrous rootlets .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="59">Thrice already Margaretta</l>
       <l n="60">To the door her way had wended ,</l>

       <l n="62">She at last approached the bedside .</l>
       <l n="63">On the table stood a cooling</l>
       <l n="64">Potion , medicines in bottles ;</l>
       <l n="65">But she neither touched the cooling</l>
       <l n="66">Potion nor the other bottles .</l>
       <l n="67">Timidly she bent there o'er him ,</l>
       <l n="68">Timidly and hardly breathing ,</l>
       <l n="69">Lest her breath might wake the sleeper .</l>
       <l n="70">Long she gazed at his closed eyelids</l>
       <l n="71">And involuntarily stooping ,</l>
       <l n="72">With her lips — But who interprets</l>
       <l n="73">All the strange mysterious actions</l>
       <l n="74">Of a first sweet loving passion ?</l>
       <l n="75">Well-nigh can my song conjecture</l>
       <l n="76">That she really wished to kiss him ;</l>
       <l n="77">But she did not ; startled sighing ,</l>
       <l n="78">Turned abruptly — like a timid</l>
       <l n="79">Fawn she hurried from the chamber .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="80">Like a man who , long accustomed</l>
       <l n="81">To the gloom and damp of dungeons ,</l>
       <l n="82">Seems bewildered when beholding ,</l>
       <l n="83">For the first time free fair Nature :</l>
       <l n="84">“ Hast thou not , O sun , grown brighter ?</l>
       <l n="85">Has the sky not deeper colours ? ”</l>
       <l n="86">And his eyes are nearly dazzled</l>
       <l n="87">By the light so long denied him :</l>
       <l n="88">Thus returns the convalescent</l>
       <l n="89">Once again to life and vigour .</l>
       <l n="90">Fresher , warmer , rosier visions</l>

       <l n="99">Playing o'er the fragrant flowers ,</l>
       <l n="100">Drew a long breath , and then slowly</l>
       <l n="101">Stepped upon the garden-terrace .</l>
       <l n="102">On the stone-seat in the sunshine</l>
       <l n="103">He sat down now . Bees were humming ,</l>

       <l n="15">Builds up proud and airy castles ;</l>

       <l n="27">Once it seemed to him like Sunday ;</l>
       <l n="28">Bells are pealing , horses neighing ,</l>
       <l n="29">Toward the Schwarzwald goes a wedding ,</l>
       <l n="30">He walks at the head as bridegroom ,</l>
       <l n="31">By his side is Margaretta ;</l>
       <l n="32">And she wears a wreath of myrtle .</l>
       <l n="33">In the village loud rejoicings ,</l>

       <l n="38">Blessing , beckoning him to enter —</l>
       <l n="39">But the vision 's thread broke off here</l>
       <l n="40">For a new one : He imagined</l>
       <l n="41">At the door there was a knocking ;</l>
       <l n="42">And now enters the odd figure</l>

       <l n="44">With his red nose shining brightly</l>
       <l n="45">In the dimly-lighted chamber ;</l>
       <l n="46">And he speaks with husky voice thus :</l>
       <l n="47">“ Oh , my lad , with love do n't meddle !</l>

       <l n="57">Cries of Allah , sabres whirring ;</l>
       <l n="58">And he soon strikes down a Pashaw</l>
       <l n="59">From his horse , and brings the crescent</l>
       <l n="60">To the general , Prince Eugene ,</l>
       <l n="61">Who then claps him on the shoulder :</l>

       <l n="63">From the battle-field his dreaming</l>
       <l n="64">Flies back to the days of childhood ,</l>

       <l n="77">“ Shall I ask the Baron for her ? ”</l>
       <l n="78">Love well-nigh appeared to him now</l>
       <l n="79">Just like stolen fruit ; he felt that ,</l>
       <l n="80">Like a thief , before the day broke ,</l>
       <l n="81">He had better leave the castle .</l>
       <l n="82">But just then the sun was rising ,</l>
       <l n="83">With the beauty of a bridegroom</l>
       <l n="84">In the blush of early morning .</l>
       <l n="85">“ Be ashamed , my heart , great coward !</l>

       <l n="242">Do you know the consequences ?</l>
       <l n="243">Our descendants would have something</l>

    <head>NOTES .</head>
    <p n="1">The town of Saekkingen , where the scene of this poem is laid , is situated amid beautiful scenery on the outskirts of the Schwarzwald ( Black Forest ) , on the right bank of the Rhine , and on the road from Basel to Constance , about 30 miles above the former place . The town owes its origin to the settlement of St. Fridolinus ( as related in the Third Part of the poem ) , who came here from Ireland in the 6th century , and founded a monastery , afterwards converted into a convent for noble ladies . The settlement was made on an island in the Rhine . In the poem the town is still considered as lying on an island , but according to the legend , St. Fridolinus altered the course of the Rhine , leading its waters entirely to the west side of the island .</p>
    <p n="2">The castle of Schoenau , on the site of the old castle of the Baron , the father of the heroine of the story , stands close to the Rhine , and is now the seat of Mr. Theodore Bally , the well-known wealthy and benevolent proprietor of large silk manufactories . He has caused the old tower of the castle to be restored , and intends to adorn its walls with frescoes , representing scenes from the poem .</p>

    <p n="9">Page 14 .— The graveyard of Saekkingen contains still the tombstone of the hero and heroine of the poem . Their names , as given there , are Franz Werner Kirchhofer and Marie Ursula von Schoenau . The first died in May , 1690 , the latter in March of the following year .</p>
    <p n="10">Page 15 .— The Eggberg is one of the mountains in the Hauenstein country , to the north of Saekkingen . The inhabitants of this country were formerly remarkable for their quaint costumes coming down from the 15th century . The men wore shirts with large frills around the neck , red stomachers , long black jackets , and wide trousers reaching below the knee , and called hozen . Hence the land was called Hozzenland . The dress of the women was also very peculiar , and of many bright colours . These old costumes are now rarely seen .</p>
    <p n="11">Page 17 .— “ The silvery lake , ” a romantic small lake , half an hour N. W . from Saekkingen . It lies in a hollow on the hills , surrounded by rocks and splendid fir-woods . The lake , which is known by the name of Berg See ( mountain lake ) , is now also called Scheffel See . It is a favourite spot for excursions from far and near , and abounds in fish .</p>

    <p n="19">Page 43 — Palsgrave Frederic married the Princess Elizabeth , daughter of James the First of England , in 1613 . He was afterwards made king of Bohemia by the Protestant princes of Germany , and moved to Prague in 1619 . In the year following his army was routed near Prague by the forces of the Catholic League , and he had to fly with his family .</p>
    <p n="20">Page 46 .— “ Of a young and handsome carpenter . ” The pastor refers here to a popular German song , still often sung by students :</p>
    <p n="21">War einst ein jung , jung Zimmergesell , Der hatte zu bauen ein Schloss , etc .</p>
    <p n="22">It is the story of a young carpenter who built a castle for a Margrave . During the absence of the latter the Margravine falls in love with the carpenter . The lovers are afterwards surprised by the Margrave , who has a gallows built on which the carpenter is hung .</p>
    <p n="23">Page 49 .— Clovis ( 465-511 ) , king of the Franks , was married , while he was still a heathen , to Clotilde , a Christian princess of Burgundy . During the battle at Tolbiac ( Zuelpich ) , near Cologne , when sorely pressed by the enemy , the Allemanni , he vowed to become a Christian , if he should gain the victory . After routing and subjugating the Allemanni , the king and many thousands of his people were baptised by the Bishop of Rheims , on the 23rd of December of the same year ( 496 ) .</p>
    <p n="24">Page 50 .— “ Augusta Rauracorum , ” Colonia Raurica , afterwards called Augusta Rauracorum , a Roman colony founded in the year 44 B. C ., by L. Munatius Plancus .

Near Basel-Augst the remains of a Roman amphitheatre and of a temple can still be seen .</p>
    <p n="25">Page 56 .— Count Ursus of Glarus had been converted to Christianity by St. Fridolinus , and , with the consent of his brother Landolph , donated , a short time before his death , all his estates to the new cloister at Saekkingen . When Landolph , after the death of his brother refused to acknowledge his will , Fridolinus was obliged to go to law in order to make good his claim , and after a long litigation was at last notified by the government of Glarus that he would not be able to have his claims settled , unless he could bring the dead Count Ursus himself in court as a witness . Then , the legend says , Fridolinus went , on the day appointed for the court , to Glarus , raised Ursus from his grave , and walked with him to Rankweil ( the seat of the court , ten hours from Glarus ) , where the count gave testimony in regard to his donation . Landolph then not only gave up his brother 's estates , but added also a large portion of his own . After that Fridolinus walked back to Glarus with Count Ursus , and committed him again to his grave . The saint , on account of this miracle , is visually portrayed in company with the skeleton of Count Ursus .</p>

    <p n="28">Page 71 .— The Wiese , a river coming from the Feldberg and flowing into the Rhine a little below Basel . The beautiful valley of the clear rapid river is now much visited , as there is a railroad as far as the town of Zell . This region has become classic through the poet Hebel , who wrote in the Allemannic idiom , still generally spoken in this whole region . At Hausen , the station before Zell , where he was born , a monument has been erected to him . There is also at Schopfheim , the station below Hausen , on a hill called Hebelshoehe , a bust of the poet The women of this region are remarkable for their large singular-looking caps , to which Scheffel alludes .</p>

It is an old custom prevailing already in the 16th century , when the woodroof was added to the wine not only to cheer the heart with its fine aroma , but also for medicinal purposes , as acting on the liver .</p>
    <p n="38">Page 135 .— Albbruck , a place above Laufenburg on the Rhine , at the mouth of the little river Alb , the valley of which is the most beautiful in the Schwarzwald . Formerly there were here quite important ironworks .</p>
    <p n="39">Page 151 .— “ E'en a common Flemish blacksmith . ” Quentin Massys ( 1466-1530 ) , a celebrated Flemish painter , said to have been originally a blacksmith . While such , he fell in love , and in order to gain the maiden 's consent as well as her father 's ( who was an artist ) he forsook his trade , devoted himself to painting , and became a great master in his art . On the tombstone which his admirers placed on his grave a hundred years after his death , stands the Latin hexameter :</p>

    <p n="41">Page 152 .— The Gnome 's cave ( Die Erdmannshoehle ) , a stalactite cave near the village of Hasel ( whence the cave is called also Haselhoehle ) , between Wehr and Schopfheim . It can be reached from the former by a walk of half an hour , and is often visited with guides . The first cave , which one reaches through a low passage , is 13 feet high , the next contains a small lake . There is also a little river rushing along under steps , over which one walks . The cave contains , like all caves of this kind , most fantastic stalactite structures , which popular fancy has called the organ , the chancel , the skeleton , &amp; c. Some columns when struck give out tones which sound as thirds . The most interesting part of the cave is called Die Fuerstengruft ( The Prince 's Sepulchre ) , a large room , 16 feet high , with a stalactite structure resembling a large coffin . Popular superstition has from times immemorial made this cave the haunt of gnomes .</p>
    <p n="42">Page 169 .— The ancient county of Hauenstein lies between two spurs of the Feldberg , the eastern one coming down to the town of Waldshut on the Rhine , the western one to Saekkingen . It is also called Hozzenland ( see note to page 15 ) . The early history of the country is somewhat obscure until the time of the Emperor Rudolph of Hapsburg , when it acknowledged the sovereignty of Austria . In the times of the fight for the German throne between Albrecht of Austria and Adolphe of Nassau , and between Frederick the Beautiful and Ludwig of Bavaria , when Suabia was without a duke and Germany without an emperor , the different villages of the country founded a union ( Einung ) for their protection . There is still in existence such a union document drawn up in the year 1433 . The entire union was divided into eight smaller ones , each of which stood under an elected leader ( Einungsmeister ) . All these eight leaders elected one of their body as speaker ( Redmann ) , who held the leadership of the entire union . By this the Hauenstein peasants were greatly protected in their ancient rights ; still the oppression of the Austrian governors ( Waldvoegte ) often incited revolutions , the most important of which occurred during the Peasants ’ War in 1525 . Others lasted from 1589 to 1614 , arising from an impost laid on wine . The poet introduces such a rising here in the course of his story .</p>
    <p n="43">Page 206 .— The Fuggers are an Augsburg family , who , by their linen-trade and weaving , and afterwards by the purchase of mines in Austria , amassed an enormous fortune , and were raised to the rank of nobles by the Emperor Maximilian .
