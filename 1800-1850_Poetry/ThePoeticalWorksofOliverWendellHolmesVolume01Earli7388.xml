   <p>EARLIER POEMS</p>
   <p>1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES</p>
   <p>This was the popular name by which the frigate Constitution was known . The poem was first printed in the Boston Daily Advertiser , at the time when it was proposed to break up the old ship as unfit for service . I subjoin the paragraph which led to the writing of the poem . It is from the Advertiser of Tuesday , September 14 , 1830 :—</p>
   <p>“ Old Ironsides .— It has been affirmed upon good authority that the Secretary of the Navy has recommended to the Board of Navy Commissioners to dispose of the frigate Constitution . Since it has been understood that such a step was in contemplation we have heard but one opinion expressed , and that in decided disapprobation of the measure . Such a national object of interest , so endeared to our national pride as Old Ironsides is , should never by any act of our government cease to belong to the Navy , so long as our country is to be found upon the map of nations . In England it was lately determined by the Admiralty to cut the Victory , a one-hundred gun ship ( which it will be recollected bore the flag of Lord Nelson at the battle of Trafalgar ,) down to a seventy-four , but so loud were the lamentations of the people upon the proposed measure that the intention was abandoned . We confidently anticipate that the Secretary of the Navy will in like manner consult the general wish in regard to the Constitution , and either let her remain in ordinary or rebuild her whenever the public service may require . ” — New York Journal of Commerce .</p>
   <p>The poem was an impromptu outburst of feeling and was published on the next day but one after reading the above paragraph .</p>

     <l n="1">AY , tear her tattered ensign down</l>
     <l n="2">Long has it waved on high ,</l>
     <l n="3">And many an eye has danced to see</l>
     <l n="4">That banner in the sky ;</l>
     <l n="5">Beneath it rung the battle shout ,</l>
     <l n="6">And burst the cannon 's roar ;—</l>
     <l n="7">The meteor of the ocean air</l>
     <l n="8">Shall sweep the clouds no more .</l>

     <l n="10">Where knelt the vanquished foe ,</l>
     <l n="11">When winds were hurrying o'er the flood ,</l>
     <l n="12">And waves were white below ,</l>
     <l n="13">No more shall feel the victor 's tread ,</l>
     <l n="14">Or know the conquered knee ;—</l>
     <l n="15">The harpies of the shore shall pluck</l>

     <l n="17">Oh better that her shattered hulk</l>

     <l n="19">Her thunders shook the mighty deep ,</l>
     <l n="20">And there should be her grave ;</l>
     <l n="21">Nail to the mast her holy flag ,</l>
     <l n="22">Set every threadbare sail ,</l>
     <l n="23">And give her to the god of storms ,</l>

    <head>THE LAST LEAF</head>
    <head>This poem was suggested by the appearance in one of our streets of a venerable relic of the Revolution , said to be one of the party who threw the tea overboard in Boston Harbor . He was a fine monumental specimen in his cocked hat and knee breeches , with his buckled shoes and his sturdy cane . The smile with which I , as a young man , greeted him , meant no disrespect to an honored fellow-citizen whose costume was out of date , but whose patriotism never changed with years . I do not recall any earlier example of this form of verse , which was commended by the fastidious Edgar Allan Poe , who made a copy of the whole poem which I have in his own handwriting . Good Abraham Lincoln had a great liking for the poem , and repeated it from memory to Governor Andrew , as the governor himself told me .</head>

     <l n="1">I SAW him once before ,</l>
     <l n="2">As he passed by the door ,</l>
     <l n="3">And again</l>
     <l n="4">The pavement stones resound ,</l>

     <l n="16">And he shakes his feeble head ,</l>

    <head>THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">OUR ancient church ! its lowly tower ,</l>
     <l n="2">Beneath the loftier spire ,</l>
     <l n="3">Is shadowed when the sunset hour</l>
     <l n="4">Clothes the tall shaft in fire ;</l>
     <l n="5">It sinks beyond the distant eye</l>
     <l n="6">Long ere the glittering vane ,</l>
     <l n="7">High wheeling in the western sky ,</l>
     <l n="8">Has faded o'er the plain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Like Sentinel and Nun , they keep</l>
     <l n="10">Their vigil on the green ;</l>
     <l n="11">One seems to guard , and one to weep ,</l>
     <l n="12">The dead that lie between ;</l>
     <l n="13">And both roll out , so full and near ,</l>
     <l n="14">Their music 's mingling waves ,</l>
     <l n="15">They shake the grass , whose pennoned spear</l>
     <l n="16">Leans on the narrow graves .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">The stranger parts the flaunting weeds ,</l>
     <l n="18">Whose seeds the winds have strown</l>

     <l n="20">They shade the sculptured stone ;</l>
     <l n="21">The child unveils his clustered brow ,</l>
     <l n="22">And ponders for a while</l>
     <l n="23">The graven willow 's pendent bough ,</l>
     <l n="24">Or rudest cherub 's smile .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">But what to them the dirge , the knell ?</l>
     <l n="26">These were the mourner 's share ,—</l>
     <l n="27">The sullen clang , whose heavy swell</l>
     <l n="28">Throbbed through the beating air ;</l>
     <l n="29">The rattling cord , the rolling stone ,</l>
     <l n="30">The shelving sand that slid ,</l>

     <l n="36">Earth hides his date and years ;</l>
     <l n="37">But , long before the once-loved name</l>
     <l n="38">Is sunk or worn away ,</l>
     <l n="39">No lip the silent dust may claim ,</l>
     <l n="40">That pressed the breathing clay .</l>

     <l n="44">The patriarchs of the town ;</l>
     <l n="45">Hast thou a tear for buried love ?</l>
     <l n="46">A sigh for transient power ?</l>

     <l n="52">The bayonet 's rending wedge ,—</l>

     <l n="54">No trace thine eye can see ,</l>

     <l n="60">Of honored names were there ;—</l>
     <l n="61">Alas ! for every tear is dried</l>
     <l n="62">Those blazoned tablets knew ,</l>

     <l n="1">A METRICAL ESSAY , READ BEFORE THE PHI BETA KAPPA SOCIETY ,</l>
     <l n="2">HARVARD UNIVERSITY , AUGUST , 1836</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">TO CHARLES WENTWORTH UPHAM , THE FOLLOWING METRICAL ESSAY IS</l>
     <l n="4">AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>This Academic Poem presents the simple and partial views of a young person trained after the schools of classical English verse as represented by Pope , Goldsmith , and Campbell , with whose lines his memory was early stocked . It will be observed that it deals chiefly with the constructive side of the poet 's function . That which makes him a poet is not the power of writing melodious rhymes , it is not the possession of ordinary human sensibilities nor even of both these qualities in connection with each other . I should rather say , if I were now called upon to define it , it is the power of transfiguring the experiences and shows of life into an aspect which comes from his imagination and kindles that of others . Emotion is its stimulus and language furnishes its expression ; but these are not all , as some might infer was the doctrine of the poem before the reader .</p>
   <p>A common mistake made by young persons who suppose themselves to have the poetical gift is that their own spiritual exaltation finds a true expression in the conventional phrases which are borrowed from the voices of the singers whose inspiration they think they share .</p>
   <p>Looking at this poem as an expression of some aspects of the ars poetica , with some passages which I can read even at this mature period of life without blushing for them , it may stand as the most serious representation of my early efforts . Intended as it was for public delivery , many of its paragraphs may betray the fact by their somewhat rhetorical and sonorous character .</p>

     <l n="1">SCENES of my youth ! awake its slumbering fire !</l>
     <l n="2">Ye winds of Memory , sweep the silent lyre !</l>
     <l n="3">Ray of the past , if yet thou canst appear ,</l>
     <l n="4">Break through the clouds of Fancy 's waning year ;</l>
     <l n="5">Chase from her breast the thin autumnal snow ,</l>

     <l n="7">Long have I wandered ; the returning tide</l>

     <l n="10">To greet the land-breeze with its faded fold ,</l>
     <l n="11">So , in remembrance of my boyhood 's time ,</l>
     <l n="12">I lift these ensigns of neglected rhyme ;</l>

     <l n="16">The morning light , which rains its quivering beams</l>
     <l n="17">Wide o'er the plains , the summits , and the streams ,</l>
     <l n="18">In one broad blaze expands its golden glow</l>
     <l n="19">On all that answers to its glance below ;</l>
     <l n="20">Yet , changed on earth , each far reflected ray</l>
     <l n="21">Braids with fresh hues the shining brow of day ;</l>
     <l n="22">Now , clothed in blushes by the painted flowers ,</l>
     <l n="23">Tracks on their cheeks the rosy-fingered hours ;</l>
     <l n="24">Now , lost in shades , whose dark entangled leaves</l>
     <l n="25">Drip at the noontide from their pendent eaves ,</l>
     <l n="26">Fades into gloom , or gleams in light again</l>

     <l n="28">We , like the leaf , the summit , or the wave ,</l>

     <l n="31">Wears on our hearts some coloring of our own</l>
     <l n="32">Chilled in the slave , and burning in the free ,</l>
     <l n="33">Like the sealed cavern by the sparkling sea ;</l>
     <l n="34">Lost , like the lightning in the sullen clod ,</l>
     <l n="35">Or shedding radiance , like the smiles of God ;</l>
     <l n="36">Pure , pale in Virtue , as the star above ,</l>
     <l n="37">Or quivering roseate on the leaves of Love ;</l>
     <l n="38">Glaring like noontide , where it glows upon</l>
     <l n="39">Ambition 's sands ,— the desert in the sun ,—</l>
     <l n="40">Or soft suffusing o'er the varied scene</l>
     <l n="41">Life 's common coloring ,— intellectual green .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="42">Thus Heaven , repeating its material plan ,</l>
     <l n="43">Arched over all the rainbow mind of man ;</l>

     <l n="45">Sees but effects , unconscious of their cause ,—</l>
     <l n="46">Believes each image in itself is bright ,</l>
     <l n="47">Not robed in drapery of reflected light ,—</l>
     <l n="48">Is like the rustic who , amidst his toil ,</l>
     <l n="49">Has found some crystal in his meagre soil ,</l>
     <l n="50">And , lost in rapture , thinks for him alone</l>
     <l n="51">Earth worked her wonders on the sparkling stone ,</l>
     <l n="52">Nor dreams that Nature , with as nice a line ,</l>
     <l n="53">Carved countless angles through the boundless mine .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="54">Thus err the many , who , entranced to find</l>
     <l n="55">Unwonted lustre in some clearer mind ,</l>
     <l n="56">Believe that Genius sets the laws at naught</l>
     <l n="57">Which chain the pinions of our wildest thought ;</l>
     <l n="58">Untaught to measure , with the eye of art ,</l>
     <l n="59">The wandering fancy or the wayward heart ;</l>
     <l n="60">Who match the little only with the less ,</l>
     <l n="61">And gaze in rapture at its slight excess ,</l>
     <l n="62">Proud of a pebble , as the brightest gem</l>
     <l n="63">Whose light might crown an emperor 's diadem .</l>

     <l n="64">And , most of all , the pure ethereal fire</l>
     <l n="65">Which seems to radiate from the poet 's lyre</l>

     <l n="67">An AEgis wielded on a mortal 's arm ,</l>
     <l n="68">While Reason turns her dazzled eye away ,</l>
     <l n="69">And bows her sceptre to her subject 's sway ;</l>
     <l n="70">And thus the poet , clothed with godlike state ,</l>
     <l n="71">Usurped his Maker 's title — to create ;</l>

     <l n="73">What others feel more fitly can express ,</l>
