JANEY HOPE MARR ( EDITOR ) To the memory of the gallant little lad who bore his grandfather 's name and image — to the dear remembrance of : Barron Hope Marr His mother dedicates whatsoever there may be of worth in her effort to show James Barron Hope , the Poet , as Virginia 's Laureate , and James Barron Hope , the Man , as he was loved and reverenced by his household and his friends .</titlePart></docTitle>
   </titlePage>
   <div type="introduction">
    <head>INTRODUCTION .</head>
    <p n="1">It has been claimed for James Barron Hope that he was “ Virginia 's Laureate . ” He did not deal in “ abstractions , or generalized arguments , ” or vague mysticisms . He fired the imagination purely , he awoke lofty thoughts and presented , through his noble odes that which is the soul of “ every true poem , a living succession of concrete images and pictures . ”</p>
    <p n="2">James Barron , the elder , organized the Virginia Colonial Navy , of which he was commander-in-chief during the Revolution , and his sons , Samuel and James , served gallantly in the United States Navy . It was from these ancestors that James Barron Hope derived that unswerving devotion to his native state for which he was remarkable , and it was at the residence of his grandfather , Commodore James Barron , the younger , who then commanded the Gosport Navy-yard , that he was born the 23d of March , 1829 .</p>
    <p n="3">His mother , Jane Barron , was the eldest daughter of the Commodore and most near to his regard . An attractive gentlewoman of the old school , generous , of quick and lively sympathies , she wielded a clever , ready pen , and the brush and embroiderer 's needle in a manner not to be scorned in those days , and was a personage in her family .</p>
    <p n="4">Her child was the child not only of her material , but of her spiritual being , and the two were closely knit as the years passed , in mutual affection and confidence , in tastes and aspirations .</p>
    <p n="5">His father was Wilton Hope of “ Bethel , ” Elizabeth City County , a handsome , talented man , a landed proprietor , of a family whose acres bordered the picturesque waters of Hampton River .</p>
    <p n="6">He gained his early education at Germantown , Pennsylvania , and at the “ Academy ” in Hampton , Virginia , under his venerated master , John B. Cary , Esq .,— the master who declares himself proud to say , “ I taught him ” — the invaluable friend of all his after years .</p>
    <p n="7">In 1847 he graduated from William and Mary College with the degree of A. B .</p>
    <p n="8">From the “ Pennsylvania , ” upon which man-of-war he was secretary to his uncle , Captain Samuel Barron , he was transferred to the “ Cyane , ” and in 1852 made a cruise to the West Indies .</p>
    <p n="9">In 1856 he was elected Commonwealth 's attorney to the “ game-cock town of Virginia , ” historic and picturesque old Hampton , which was the centre of a charming and cultivated society and which had already claimed him as her “ bard . ” For as Henry Ellen he had contributed to various southern publications , his poems in “ The Southern Literary Messenger ” attracting much gratifying attention .</p>
    <p n="10">In 1857 Lippincott brought out “ Leoni di Monota and Other Poems . ” The volume was cordially noticed by the southern critics of the time , not only for its central poem , but also for several of its minor ones , notably , “ The Charge at Balaklava , ” which G. P. R . James — as have others since — declared unsurpassed by Tennyson 's “ Charge of the Light Brigade . ”</p>
    <p n="11">Upon the 13th of May , 1857 , he stood poet at the 250th anniversary of the English settlement at Jamestown .</p>
    <p n="12">As poet , and as the youthful colleague of Henry A . Wise and John R. Thompson , he stood at the base of Crawford 's statue of Washington , in the Capitol Square , Richmond , Virginia , the 22d of February , 1858 . That same year these recited poems , together with some miscellaneous ones were published .</p>
    <p n="13">Congress chose him as poet for the Yorktown Centennial , 1881 , and his “ brilliant and masterly poem was a fitting companion piece to the splendid oration delivered upon that occasion by the renowned orator , Robert C. Winthrop . ”</p>
    <p n="14">This metrical address “ Arms and the Man , ” with various sonnets was published the next year . As the flower of his genius , its noble measures only revealed their full beauty when they fell from the lips of him who framed them , and it was under this spell that one of those who had thronged about him that 19th of October cried out : “ Now I understand the power by which the old Greek poets swayed the men of their generation . ”</p>
    <p n="15">Again his State called upon him to weave among her annals the laurels of his verse at the laying of the cornerstone of the monument erected in Richmond to Robert E. Lee . The corner-stone was laid October , 1887 , but the poet 's voice had been stilled forever . He died September the 15th , as he had often wished to die , “ in harness , ” and at home , and Death came swift and painless .</p>
    <p n="16">His poem , save for the after softening touches , had been finished the previous day , and was recited at the appointed time and place by Captain William Gordon McCabe .</p>
    <p n="17">“ Memoriæ Sacrum , ” the Lee Memorial Ode , has been pronounced by many his masterpiece , and waked this noble echo in a brother poet 's soul :</p>
    <p n="18">‘ Like those of whom the olden scriptures tell , Who faltered not , but went on dangerous quest , For one cool draught of water from the well With which to cheer their exiled monarch 's breast ; ’</p>
    <p n="19">‘ So thou to add one single laurel more To our great chieftain 's fame — heedless of pain Didst gather up thy failing strength and pour Out all thy soul in one last glorious strain . ’</p>
    <p n="20">“ And when the many pilgrims come to gaze Upon the sculptured form of mighty Lee , They 'll not forget the bard who sang his praise With dying breath , but deathless melody . ”</p>
    <p n="21">“ For on the statue which a country rears , Tho ’ graven by no hand , we 'll surely see , E'en tho ’ it be thro ’ blinding mists of tears , Thy name forever linked with that of Lee . ”</p>
    <p n="22">— Rev . Beverly D. Tucker .</p>
    <p n="23">His genius had flowered not out of opulence , or congenial occupation , but out of the tread-mill of newspaper life , and under such conditions from 1870-1887 he delivered the poem at Lynchburg 's celebration of its founding ; at the unveiling of the monument raised to Annie Lee by the ladies of Warren County , North Carolina ; memorial odes in Warrenton , Virginia , in Portsmouth , and Norfolk , and at the Virginia Military Institute . He was the first commander of Norfolk 's Camp of Confederate Veterans , the Pickett-Buchanan , but through all his stirring lines there breaks no discordant note of hate or rancor . He also sent into print , “ Little Stories for Little People , ” and his novel “ Madelon , ” and delivered among various masterly addresses , “ Virginia — Her Past , Present and Future , ” and “ The Press and the Printer 's Devil . ”</p>
    <p n="24">During these years he had suffered a physical agony well-nigh past the bearing , but which he bore with a wonderful patience and fortitude , and not only bore , but hid away from those nearest to him . He had brought both broken health and fortunes out of the war ; for when in 1861 the people of Hampton left the town ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>“ Its men to join the Southern army , and its women to go in exile for four long weary years , returning thence to find their homes in ashes , James Barron Hope was among the first who left their household gods behind to take up arms for their native State , and he bore his part nobly in the great conflict . ”</p>
    <p n="25">When it ended he did not return to Hampton , or to the practice of his profession . Instead of the law he embarked in journalism in Norfolk , Virginia , and , despite its lack of entire congeniality , made therefrom a career as brilliant as it was fearless and unsullied .</p>
<note>Footnote : A : “ They themselves applying the torch to their own homes under the patriotic , but mistaken idea that they would thus arrest the march of the Invaders . ” ( “ Col. Cary 's address at unveiling of monument to Captain Hope . ” )</note>    <note xml:id="note" place="bottom" n="">A : “ They themselves applying the torch to their own homes under the patriotic , but mistaken idea that they would thus arrest the march of the Invaders . ” ( “ Col. Cary 's address at unveiling of monument to Captain Hope . ” )</note>
    <p n="26">Introduction .</p>
    <p n="27">He was a little under six feet in height , slender , graceful , and finely proportioned , with hands and feet of distinctive beauty . And his fingers were gifted with a woman 's touch in the sick-room , and an artist 's grasp upon the pencil and the brush of the water-colorist .</p>
    <p n="28">It was said of him that his manner was as courtly as that of “ Sir Roger de Coverly . ” Words which though fitly applied are but as the bare outlines of a picture , for he was the embodiment of what was best in the Old South . He was gifted with a rare charm . There was charm in his pale face , which in conversation flashed out of its deep thoughtfulness into vivid animation . His fine head was crowned with soft hair fast whitening before its time . His eyes shone under his broad white forehead , wise and serene , until his dauntless spirit , or his lofty enthusiasm awoke to fire their grey depths . His was a face that women trusted and that little children looked up into with smiles . Those whom he called friend learned the meaning of that name , and he drew and linked men to him from all ranks and conditions of life .</p>
    <p n="29">Beloved by many , those who guard his memory coin the very fervor of their hearts into the speech with which they link his name . “ A very Chevalier Bayard ” he was called .</p>
    <p n="30">Of him was quoted that noble epitaph on the great Lord Fairfax :</p>
    <p n="31">‘ Both sexes ’ virtues in him combined , He had the fierceness of the manliest mind , And all the meekness too of woman kind . ’</p>
    <p n="32">‘ He never knew what envy was , nor hate , His soul was filled with worth and honesty , And with another thing quite out of date , called modesty . ’</p>
    <p n="33">No sketch could approach justice toward Captain Hope without at least a brief review of his domestic life .</p>
    <p n="34">In 1857 he had married Miss Annie Beverly Whiting of Hampton . Hers were the face and form to take captive his poet 's fancy , and she possessed a character as lovely as her person ; a courage and strength of will far out of proportion to her dainty shape , and an intellect of masculine robustness . Often the editor brought his work to the table of his library that he might avail himself of his wife 's judgment , and labor with the faces around him that he loved , for their union was a very congenial one , and when two daughters came to bless it , as husband and father , he poured out the treasures of his heart , his mind and soul . To his children he was a wise teacher , a tender guide , an unfailing friend , the most delightful of companions . His sympathy for and his understanding of young people never aged , and he had a circle of dear and familiar friends of varying ages that gathered about him once a week . There , beside his own hearth , his ready wit , his kindly humor sparkled most brightly , and there flowed forth most evenly that speech accounted by many well worth the hearing . For his was also the art of listening ; he not only led the expression of thought , but inspired it in others . His own roof-tree looked down upon James Barron Hope at his best and down upon a home in the sacred sense of the word , for he touched with poetry the prose of daily living , and left to those who loved him the blessed legacy of a memory which death cannot take from them .</p>
    <p n="35">I have said that in his early years Old Hampton claimed him . He became the son of the city of his adoption and sleeps among her dead .</p>
    <p n="36">Above his ashes rises a shaft , fashioned from the stones of the State he loved so well which proclaims that it is “ The tribute of his friends offered to the memory of the Poet , Patriot , Scholar , and Journalist and the Knightly Virginia Gentleman . ”</p>

    <head>THE CHARGE AT BALAKLAVA .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Nolan halted where the squadrons ,</l>
     <l n="2">Stood impatient of delay ,</l>
     <l n="3">Out he drew his brief dispatches ,</l>
     <l n="4">Which their leader quickly snatches ,</l>
     <l n="5">At a glance their meaning catches ;</l>
     <l n="6">They are ordered to the fray !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">All that morning they had waited —</l>
     <l n="8">As their frowning faces showed ,</l>
     <l n="9">Horses stamping , riders fretting ,</l>
     <l n="10">And their teeth together setting ;</l>
     <l n="11">Not a single sword-blade wetting</l>
     <l n="12">As the battle ebbed and flowed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">Now the fevered spell is broken ,</l>
     <l n="14">Every man feels twice as large ,</l>
     <l n="15">Every heart is fiercely leaping ,</l>
     <l n="16">As a lion roused from sleeping ,</l>
     <l n="17">For they know they will be sweeping</l>
     <l n="18">In a moment to the charge .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">Brightly gleam six hundred sabres ,</l>
     <l n="20">And the brazen trumpets ring ;</l>
     <l n="21">Steeds are gathered , spurs are driven ,</l>
     <l n="22">And the heavens widely riven</l>
     <l n="23">With a mad shout upward given ,</l>
     <l n="24">Scaring vultures on the wing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">Stern its meaning ; was not Gallia</l>
     <l n="26">Looking down on Albion 's sons ?</l>
     <l n="27">In each mind this thought implanted ,</l>
     <l n="28">Undismayed and all undaunted ,</l>
     <l n="29">By the battle-fiends enchanted ,</l>
     <l n="30">They ride down upon the guns .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">Onward ! On ! the chargers trample ;</l>
     <l n="32">Quicker falls each iron heel !</l>
     <l n="33">And the headlong pace grows faster ;</l>
     <l n="34">Noble steed and noble master ,</l>
     <l n="35">Rushing on to red disaster ,</l>
     <l n="36">Where the heavy cannons peal .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">In the van rides Captain Nolan ;</l>
     <l n="38">Soldier stout he was and brave !</l>
     <l n="39">And his shining sabre flashes ,</l>
     <l n="40">As upon the foe he dashes :</l>
     <l n="41">God ! his face turns white as ashes ,</l>
     <l n="42">He has ridden to his grave !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="43">Down he fell , prone from his saddle ,</l>
     <l n="44">Without motion , without breath ,</l>
     <l n="45">Never more a trump to waken —</l>
     <l n="46">He the very first one taken ,</l>
     <l n="47">From the bough so sorely shaken ,</l>
     <l n="48">In the vintage-time of Death .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="49">In a moment , in a twinkling ,</l>
     <l n="50">He was gathered to his rest ;</l>
     <l n="51">In the time for which he 'd waited —</l>
     <l n="52">With his gallant heart elated —</l>
     <l n="53">Down went Nolan , decorated</l>
     <l n="54">With a death wound on his breast .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="55">Comrades still are onward charging ,</l>
     <l n="56">He is lying on the sod :</l>
     <l n="57">Onward still their steeds are rushing</l>
     <l n="58">Where the shot and shell are crushing ;</l>
     <l n="59">From his corpse the blood is gushing ,</l>
     <l n="60">And his soul is with his God .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="61">As they spur on , what strange visions</l>
     <l n="62">Flit across each rider 's brain !</l>
     <l n="63">Thoughts of maidens fair , of mothers ,</l>
     <l n="64">Friends and sisters , wives and brothers ,</l>
     <l n="65">Blent with images of others ,</l>
     <l n="66">Whom they ne'er shall see again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="67">Onward still the squadrons thunder —</l>

     <l n="69">Men and horses without number</l>
     <l n="70">All the furrowed ground encumber —</l>
     <l n="71">Falling fast to their last slumber —</l>
     <l n="72">Bloody slumber ! bloody grave !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="73">Of that charge at Balaklava —</l>
     <l n="74">In its chivalry sublime —</l>

     <l n="76">Shall descend to future ages ;</l>
     <l n="77">Poets , painters , hoary sages</l>
     <l n="78">Shall record it for all time ;</l>

     <l n="79">Telling how those English horsemen</l>
     <l n="80">Rode the Russian gunners down ;</l>

     <l n="82">How with helmets hacked and battered ;</l>
     <l n="83">How with sword arms blood-bespattered ;</l>
     <l n="84">They won honor and renown .</l>

     <l n="85">‘ Twas “ not war , ” but it was splendid</l>

    <head>THE JAMESTOWN ANNIVERSARY ODE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In those vast forests dwelt a race of kings ,</l>
     <l n="2">Free as the eagle when he spreads his wings —</l>
     <l n="3">His wings which never in their wild flight lag —</l>
     <l n="4">In mists which fly the fierce tornado 's flag ;</l>
     <l n="5">Their flight the eagle 's ! and their name , alas !</l>
     <l n="6">The eagle 's shadow swooping o'er the grass ,</l>
     <l n="7">Or , as it fades , it well may seem to be</l>
     <l n="8">The shade of tempest driven o'er the sea .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Fierce , too , this race , as mountain torrent wild ,</l>
     <l n="10">With haughty hearts , where Mercy rarely smiled —</l>
     <l n="11">All their traditions — histories imbued</l>
     <l n="12">With tales of war and sanguinary feud ,</l>
     <l n="13">Yet though they never couched the knightly lance ,</l>
     <l n="14">The glowing songs of Europe 's old romance</l>
     <l n="15">Can find their parallels amid the race ,</l>
     <l n="16">Which , on this spot , met England face to face .</l>
     <l n="17">And when they met the white man , hand to hand ,</l>
     <l n="18">Twilight and sunrise stood upon the strand —</l>
     <l n="19">Twilight and sunrise ? Saxon sunshine gleams</l>
     <l n="20">To-day o'er prairies and those distant streams ,</l>
     <l n="21">Which hurry onward through far Western plains ,</l>
     <l n="22">Where the last Indian , for a season , reigns .</l>
     <l n="23">Here , the red CANUTE on this spot , sat down ,</l>
     <l n="24">His splendid forehead stormy with a frown ,</l>
     <l n="25">To quell , with the wild lightning of his glance</l>
     <l n="26">The swift encroachment of the wave 's advance ;</l>
     <l n="27">To meet and check the ruthless tide which rose ,</l>
     <l n="28">Crest after crest of energetic foes ,</l>
     <l n="29">While high and strong poured on each cruel wave ,</l>
     <l n="30">Until they left his royalty — a grave ;</l>
     <l n="31">But , o'er this wild , tumultuous deluge glows</l>
     <l n="32">A vision fair as Heaven to saint e'er shows ;</l>
     <l n="33">A dove of mercy o'er the billows dark</l>
     <l n="34">Fluttered awhile then fled within God 's ark .</l>
     <l n="35">Had I the power , I 'd reverently describe</l>
     <l n="36">That peerless maid — the “ pearl of all her tribe , ”</l>
     <l n="37">As evening fair , when coming night and day</l>
     <l n="38">Contend together which shall wield its sway .</l>
     <l n="39">But , here abashed , my paltry fancy stays ;</l>
     <l n="40">For her , too humble its most stately lays .</l>
     <l n="41">A shade of twilight 's softest , sweetest gloom —</l>
     <l n="42">The dusk of morning — found a splendid tomb</l>
     <l n="43">In England 's glare ; so strange , so vast , so bright ,</l>
     <l n="44">The dusk of morning burst in splendid light ,</l>
     <l n="45">Which falleth through the Past 's cathedral aisles ,</l>
     <l n="46">Till sculptured Mercy like a seraph smiles .</l>
     <l n="47">And though Fame 's grand and consecrated fane</l>
     <l n="48">No kingly statue may , in time , retain ,</l>
     <l n="49">Her name shall linger , nor with age grow faint ;</l>
     <l n="50">Its simple sound — the image of a saint .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="51">Sad is the story of that maiden 's race ,</l>
     <l n="52">Long driven from each legendary place .</l>
     <l n="53">All their expansive hunting-grounds are now</l>
     <l n="54">Torn by the iron of the Saxon 's plough ,</l>
     <l n="55">Which turns up skulls and arrow-heads and bones —</l>
     <l n="56">Their places nameless and unmarked by stones .</l>
     <l n="57">Now freighted vessels toil along the view ,</l>
     <l n="58">Where once was seen the Indian 's bark canoe ;</l>
     <l n="59">And to the woods the shrill escaping steam</l>
     <l n="60">Proclaims our triumph in discordant scream .</l>
     <l n="61">Where rose the wigwam in its sylvan shade ,</l>
     <l n="62">Where the bold hunter in his freedom strayed ,</l>
     <l n="63">And met his foe or chased the bounding stag ,</l>
     <l n="64">The lazy horses at the harrow lag .</l>
     <l n="65">Where the rude dance was held or war-song rose ,</l>
     <l n="66">The scene is one of plenty and repose .</l>
     <l n="67">The quiver of her race is empty now ,</l>
     <l n="68">Its bow lies broken underneath the plough ;</l>
     <l n="69">And where the wheat-fields ripple in the gale ,</l>
     <l n="70">The vanished hunter scarcely leaves a trail .</l>
     <l n="71">‘ Twas where yon river musically flows ,</l>
     <l n="72">The European 's nomenclature rose ;</l>
     <l n="73">A keen-edged axe , which since , alas ! has swept</l>
     <l n="74">Away their names — those boughs , which blossoms kept ,</l>
     <l n="75">Leaving so few , that when their story 's drowned ,</l>
     <l n="76">‘ Twill sink , alas ! with no fair garland crowned .</l>
     <l n="77">What strange vicissitudes and perils fell</l>
     <l n="78">On the first settlers ‘ tis not mine to tell ;</l>
     <l n="79">I scarce may pause to syllable the name</l>
     <l n="80">Which the great Captain left behind to fame ;</l>
     <l n="81">A name which echoes through the tented past</l>
     <l n="82">Like sound of charge rung in a bugle 's blast .</l>
     <l n="83">His age , although it still put faith in stars ,</l>
     <l n="84">No longer glanced through feudal helmet 's bars ,</l>
     <l n="85">But stood in its half armor ; thus stands he</l>
     <l n="86">An image half of antique chivalry ,</l>
     <l n="87">And half presented to our eager eyes ,</l>
     <l n="88">The brilliant type of modern enterprise .</l>
     <l n="89">A knightly blade , without one spot of rust ,</l>
     <l n="90">Undimmed by time and undefaced by dust ,</l>
     <l n="91">His name hangs up in that past age 's hall ,</l>
     <l n="92">Where many hang , the brightest of them all .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">An ancient Chronicle has told</l>
     <l n="2">That , in the famous days of old ,</l>
     <l n="3">In Antioch under ground</l>
     <l n="4">The self-same lance was found —</l>
     <l n="5">Unbitten by corrosive rust —</l>
     <l n="6">The lance the Roman soldier thrust</l>
     <l n="7">In CHRIST 'S bare side upon the Tree ;</l>
     <l n="8">And that it brought</l>
     <l n="9">A mighty spell</l>
     <l n="10">To those who fought</l>
     <l n="11">The Infidel</l>
     <l n="12">And mighty victory .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">And so this day</l>
     <l n="14">To you I say —</l>
     <l n="15">Speaking for millions of true Southern men —</l>
     <l n="16">In words that have no undertow —</l>
     <l n="17">I say , and say agen :</l>
     <l n="18">Come weal , or woe ,</l>
     <l n="19">Should this Republic ever fight ,</l>
     <l n="20">By land , or sea ,</l>
     <l n="21">For present law , or ancient right</l>
     <l n="22">The South will be</l>
     <l n="23">As was that lance ,</l>
     <l n="24">Albeit not found</l>
     <l n="25">Hid under ground</l>
     <l n="26">But in the forefront of the first advance !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ Twill fly a pennon fair As ever kissed the air , On it , for every glance , Shall blaze majestic France Blent with our Hero 's name In everlasting flame , And written , fair in gold , This legend on its fold : Give us back the ties of Yorktown ! Perish all the modern hates ! Let us stand together , brothers , In defiance of the Fates ; FOR THE SAFETY OF THE UNION IS THE SAFETY OF THE STATES !</p>
