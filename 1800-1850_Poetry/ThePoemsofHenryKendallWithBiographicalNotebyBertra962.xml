   <p>To a Mountain</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">To thee , O father of the stately peaks ,</l>
     <l n="2">Above me in the loftier light — to thee ,</l>
     <l n="3">Imperial brother of those awful hills</l>
     <l n="4">Whose feet are set in splendid spheres of flame ,</l>
     <l n="5">Whose heads are where the gods are , and whose sides</l>
     <l n="6">Of strength are belted round with all the zones</l>
     <l n="7">Of all the world , I dedicate these songs .</l>
     <l n="8">And if , within the compass of this book ,</l>
     <l n="9">There lives and glows one verse in which there beats</l>
     <l n="10">The pulse of wind and torrent — if one line</l>
     <l n="11">Is here that like a running water sounds ,</l>
     <l n="12">And seems an echo from the lands of leaf ,</l>
     <l n="13">Be sure that line is thine . Here , in this home ,</l>
     <l n="14">Away from men and books and all the schools ,</l>
     <l n="15">I take thee for my Teacher . In thy voice</l>
     <l n="16">Of deathless majesty , I , kneeling , hear</l>
     <l n="17">God 's grand authentic Gospel ! Year by year ,</l>
     <l n="18">The great sublime cantata of thy storm</l>
     <l n="19">Strikes through my spirit — fills it with a life</l>
     <l n="20">Of startling beauty ! Thou my Bible art ,</l>
     <l n="21">With holy leaves of rock , and flower , and tree ,</l>
     <l n="22">And moss , and shining runnel . From each page</l>
     <l n="23">That helps to make thy awful volume , I</l>
     <l n="24">Have learned a noble lesson . In the psalm</l>
     <l n="25">Of thy grave winds , and in the liturgy</l>
     <l n="26">Of singing waters , lo ! my soul has heard</l>
     <l n="27">The higher worship ; and from thee , indeed ,</l>
     <l n="28">The broad foundations of a finer hope</l>
     <l n="29">Were gathered in ; and thou hast lifted up</l>
     <l n="30">The blind horizon for a larger faith !</l>
     <l n="31">Moreover , walking in exalted woods</l>
     <l n="32">Of naked glory , in the green and gold</l>
     <l n="33">Of forest sunshine , I have paused like one</l>
     <l n="34">With all the life transfigured ; and a flood</l>
     <l n="35">Of light ineffable has made me feel</l>
     <l n="36">As felt the grand old prophets caught away</l>
     <l n="37">By flames of inspiration ; but the words</l>
     <l n="38">Sufficient for the story of my Dream</l>
     <l n="39">Are far too splendid for poor human lips .</l>
     <l n="40">But thou , to whom I turn with reverent eyes —</l>
     <l n="41">O stately Father , whose majestic face</l>
     <l n="42">Shines far above the zone of wind and cloud ,</l>
     <l n="43">Where high dominion of the morning is —</l>
     <l n="44">Thou hast the Song complete of which my songs</l>
     <l n="45">Are pallid adumbrations ! Certain sounds</l>
     <l n="46">Of strong authentic sorrow in this book</l>
     <l n="47">May have the sob of upland torrents — these ,</l>
     <l n="48">And only these , may touch the great World 's heart ;</l>
     <l n="49">For , lo ! they are the issues of that grief</l>
     <l n="50">Which makes a man more human , and his life</l>
     <l n="51">More like that frank , exalted life of thine .</l>
     <l n="52">But in these pages there are other tones</l>
     <l n="53">In which thy large , superior voice is not —</l>
     <l n="54">Through which no beauty that resembles thine</l>
     <l n="55">Has ever shone . These are the broken words</l>
     <l n="56">Of blind occasions , when the World has come</l>
     <l n="57">Between me and my Dream . No song is here</l>
     <l n="58">Of mighty compass ; for my singing robes</l>
     <l n="59">I 've worn in stolen moments . All my days</l>
     <l n="60">Have been the days of a laborious life ,</l>
     <l n="61">And ever on my struggling soul has burned</l>
     <l n="62">The fierce heat of this hurried sphere . But thou ,</l>
     <l n="63">To whose fair majesty I dedicate</l>
     <l n="64">My book of rhymes — thou hast the perfect rest</l>
     <l n="65">Which makes the heaven of the highest gods !</l>
     <l n="66">To thee the noises of this violent time</l>
     <l n="67">Are far , faint whispers ; and , from age to age ,</l>
     <l n="68">Within the world and yet apart from it ,</l>
     <l n="69">Thou standest ! Round thy lordly capes the sea</l>
     <l n="70">Rolls on with a superb indifference</l>
     <l n="71">For ever ; in thy deep , green , gracious glens</l>
     <l n="72">The silver fountains sing for ever . Far</l>
     <l n="73">Above dim ghosts of waters in the caves ,</l>
     <l n="74">The royal robe of morning on thy head</l>
     <l n="75">Abides for ever . Evermore the wind</l>
     <l n="76">Is thy august companion ; and thy peers</l>
     <l n="77">Are cloud , and thunder , and the face sublime</l>
     <l n="78">Of blue mid-heaven ! On thy awful brow</l>
     <l n="79">Is Deity ; and in that voice of thine</l>
     <l n="80">There is the great imperial utterance</l>
     <l n="81">Of God for ever ; and thy feet are set</l>
     <l n="82">Where evermore , through all the days and years ,</l>
     <l n="83">There rolls the grand hymn of the deathless wave .</l>

     <l n="84">Mary Rivers</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="85">Path beside the silver waters , flashing in October 's sun —</l>
     <l n="86">Walk , by green and golden margins where the sister streamlets run —</l>
     <l n="87">Twenty shining springs have vanished , full of flower , and leaf , and bird ,</l>
     <l n="88">Since the step of Mary Rivers in your lawny dell was heard !</l>
     <l n="89">Twenty white-haired Junes have left us —</l>
     <l n="90">grey with frost and bleak with gale —</l>
     <l n="91">Since the hand of her we loved so plucked the blossoms in your dale .</l>
     <l n="92">Twenty summers , twenty autumns , from the grand old hills have passed ,</l>
     <l n="93">With their robes of royal colour , since we saw the darling last .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="94">Morning comes — the blessed morning ! and the slow song of the sea ,</l>
     <l n="95">Like a psalm from radiant altars , floats across a rose-red lea ;</l>
     <l n="96">Then the fair , strong noonday blossoms , and the reaper seeks the cool</l>
     <l n="97">Valley of the moss and myrtle , and the glimmering water-pool .</l>
     <l n="98">Noonday flames and evening follows ; and the lordly mountains rest</l>
     <l n="99">Heads arrayed with tenfold splendour on the rich heart of the West .</l>
     <l n="100">Evening walks with moon and music where the higher life has been ;</l>
     <l n="101">But the face of Mary Rivers there will nevermore be seen .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="102">Ah ! when autumn dells are dewy , and the wave is very still ,</l>
     <l n="103">And that grey ghost called the Twilight passes from the distant hill —</l>
     <l n="104">Even in the hallowed nightfall , when the fathers sit and dream ,</l>
     <l n="105">And the splendid rose of heaven sees a sister in the stream —</l>
     <l n="106">Often do I watch the waters gleaming in a starry bay ,</l>
     <l n="107">Thinking of a bygone beauty , and a season far away ;</l>
     <l n="108">Musing on the grace that left us in a time of singing rain ,</l>
     <l n="109">On the lady who will never walk amongst these heaths again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="110">Four there were , but two were taken ; and this darling we deplore ,</l>
     <l n="111">She was sweetest of the circle — she was dearest of the four !</l>
     <l n="112">In the daytime and the dewtime comes the phantom of her face :</l>
     <l n="113">None will ever sit where she did — none will ever fill her place .</l>
     <l n="114">With the passing of our Mary , like a sunset out of sight ,</l>
     <l n="115">Passed away our pure first passion — all its life and all its light !</l>
     <l n="116">All that made the world a dreamland — all the glory and the glow</l>
     <l n="117">Of the fine , fresh , morning feeling vanished twenty years ago .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="118">Girl , whose strange , unearthly beauty haunts us ever in our sleep ,</l>
     <l n="119">Many griefs have worn our hearts out — we are now too tired to weep !</l>
     <l n="120">Time has tried us , years have changed us ; but the sweetness shed by you</l>
     <l n="121">Falls upon our spirits daily , like divine , immortal dew .</l>
     <l n="122">Shining are our thoughts about you — of the blossoms past recall ,</l>
     <l n="123">You are still the rose of lustre — still the fairest of them all ;</l>
     <l n="124">In the sleep that brings the garland gathered from the bygone hours ,</l>
     <l n="125">You are still our Mary Rivers — still the queen of all the flowers .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="126">Let me ask , where none can hear me — When you passed into the shine ,</l>
     <l n="127">And you heard a great love calling , did you know that it was mine ?</l>
     <l n="128">In your life of light and music , tell me did you ever see ,</l>
     <l n="129">Shining in a holy silence , what was as a flame in me ?</l>
     <l n="130">Ah , my darling ! no one saw it . Purer than untrodden dew</l>
     <l n="131">Was that first unhappy passion buried in the grave with you .</l>
     <l n="132">Bird and leaf will keep the secret — wind and wood will never tell</l>
     <l n="133">Men the thing that I have whispered . Mary Rivers , fare you well !</l>

     <l n="134">Kingsborough</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="135">A waving of hats and of hands ,</l>
     <l n="136">The voices of thousands in one ,</l>
     <l n="137">A shout from the ring and the stands ,</l>
     <l n="138">And a glitter of heads in the sun !</l>
     <l n="139">“ They are off — they are off ! ” is the roar ,</l>
     <l n="140">As the cracks settle down to the race ,</l>
     <l n="141">With the “ yellow and black ” to the fore ,</l>
     <l n="142">And the Panic blood forcing the pace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="143">At the back of the course , and away</l>
     <l n="144">Where the running-ground home again wheels ,</l>

     <l n="146">With a feather-weight hard at his heels .</l>
     <l n="147">But Yeomans , you see , is about ,</l>
     <l n="148">And the wily New Zealander waits ,</l>
     <l n="149">Though the high-blooded flyer is out ,</l>
     <l n="150">Whose rider and colours are Tait 's .</l>

     <l n="151">Look ! Ashworth comes on with a run</l>
     <l n="152">To the head of the Levity colt ;</l>
     <l n="153">And the fleet — the magnificent son</l>
     <l n="154">Of Panic is shooting his bolt .</l>
     <l n="155">Hurrah for the Weatherbit strain !</l>
     <l n="156">A Fireworks is first in the straight ;</l>
     <l n="157">And “ A Kelpie will win it again ! ”</l>

     <l n="159">The leader must have it — but no !</l>

     <l n="161">A beautiful , wonderful foe</l>
     <l n="162">With the speed of the thunder and wind !</l>
     <l n="163">A flashing of whips , and a cry ,</l>
     <l n="164">And Ashworth sits down on his horse ,</l>
     <l n="165">With Kingsborough 's head at his thigh</l>

     <l n="170">A marvel of muscle and pluck !</l>

     <l n="175">The first , and the favourite too !</l>
     <l n="176">The terror that came from his stall ,</l>

     <l n="178">To show the road home to them all ;</l>
     <l n="179">From the back of the field to the straight</l>

     <l n="187">To starter for Leger or Cup ,</l>

     <l n="191">No ! rather the questionless pluck</l>
