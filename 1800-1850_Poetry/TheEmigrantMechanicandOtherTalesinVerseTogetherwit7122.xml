    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">The Author of this volume does not feel much apology necessary for its publication , though the world is already flooded with Rhyme , upon almost every conceivable subject , and most of it of a very mediocre character .</p>
    <p n="2">Though living but a short time upon a Bush farm , my experiences were of such a practical nature as to entitle me to speak with confidence on many rural matters . The religious opinions so frequently and strongly expressed are the result of a careful study of God 's Word , and I feel that for them no apology is necessary .</p>
    <p n="3">To learning I make but the most slender pretentions . Born in one of the humblest ranks in life , and going to my trade at the commencement of my teens , and working long weary hours for seven years at that trade , I found little opportunity of attaining anything like proficiency in literary composition . Many of my minor pieces have already seen the light in local and other newspapers , etc ., and acting on the advice of several literary friends I have at last gathered my principal poems together in a permanent form . Should this effort not meet with public favor , the offense — if such it be — is not likely to be repeated , as I am now over sixty-five years of age . Many of the productions of my humble Muse were conceived , and in a great measure composed , while working at the bench — to which I am still confined , in order to provide for my family 's needs .</p>
    <p n="4">If the advice of Pope to some of the Rhymers of his day was needful , viz ., “ to keep their effusions for seven years , ” I can say truly most of mine have been kept that period nearly four times over . I would not have the reader imagine that they have necessarily grown better by being on the shelf ; still this has afforded an opportunity for polishing them up in some measure .</p>
    <p n="5">I may further say my “ Emigrant Mechanic ” was nearly or quite finished before Mr. McLachlan 's “ Emigrant ” was published , and before I had ever heard of “ The U. E ., ” a beautiful and very interesting Emigrant poem by Mr. Kerby , of Niagara .</p>
    <p n="6">My warmest thanks are due the Rev . W. W. Smith , of Newmarket , Ont ., for his kindness in undertaking the preparation of these pages for the press . Also for many valuable emendations .</p>
    <p n="7">Such as they are I send forth my unlearned rhymes , with the earnest prayer that they may benefit the reader as much as they have benefitted me , for I can say in the words of Coleridge , “ Poetry has been to me its own exceeding great reward . ”</p>
    <p n="8">THOMAS COWHERD . Brantford , Ontario , January , 1884 .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">My harp awakes ! And as I touch each string ,</l>
     <l n="2">The poor Mechanic Emigrant I sing .</l>
     <l n="3">Eighteen eventful years , or rather more ,</l>
     <l n="4">Have fled since first he left his native shore —</l>
     <l n="5">That much-loved shore ! that dear old English home !</l>
     <l n="6">So oft regretted since first led to roam .</l>
     <l n="7">My Muse , ‘ tis thine to give in artless lays ,</l>
     <l n="8">A genuine history of his early days ;</l>
     <l n="9">Make known the place where first he saw the light ,</l>
     <l n="10">Portray the scenes which pleased his boyish sight ,</l>
     <l n="11">Unfold his parentage , and backward trace</l>
     <l n="12">Their line , descended from no common race ;</l>
     <l n="13">Speak of his eagerness to learn a trade ,</l>
     <l n="14">Mark what proficiency in that he made ,</l>
     <l n="15">Glance at his love scenes , and a lesson show ,</l>
     <l n="16">Which youths in general would do well to know .</l>
     <l n="17">Fail not to tell how , in his eighteenth year ,</l>
     <l n="18">He did , as Christian , publicly appear .</l>
     <l n="19">Make known the cause that led him first to feel</l>
     <l n="20">A strong desire to seek his future weal ,</l>
     <l n="21">In emigration to that distant shore</l>
     <l n="22">Where flow great rivers , and loud cataracts roar ;</l>
     <l n="23">Where mighty lakes afford the fullest scope</l>
     <l n="24">For future commerce , and the settler 's hope .</l>
     <l n="25">Go with him to his home in the wild woods —</l>
     <l n="26">That rude log cottage where he stored his goods ;</l>
     <l n="27">Paint faithfully the scenes through which he passed ,</l>
     <l n="28">And how he settled in a town at last ;</l>
     <l n="29">What then befel him in successive years ,</l>
     <l n="30">Or aught which to thee suitable appears ,</l>
     <l n="31">To make his history such as may be read</l>
     <l n="32">By high-born race , or those more lowly bred .</l>
     <l n="33">Let usefulness be still thy constant aim ,</l>
     <l n="34">Nor care a jot for merely worldly fame .</l>
     <l n="35">Help me to seek , by constant , earnest prayer</l>
     <l n="36">That God 's approval be my chiefest care .</l>
     <l n="37">And if a Poet thou would'st wish to make</l>
     <l n="38">Thy guide and pattern , gentle COWPER take .</l>
     <l n="39">Thus , O my Muse ! may we together spend</l>
     <l n="40">Some happy hours , until my task shall end .</l>
     <l n="41">And when ‘ tis finished , may it ne'er be said</l>
     <l n="42">That we a useless memoir have displayed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="43">In the northwest of England 's verdant isle ,</l>
     <l n="44">Where beauteous scenery meets one with a smile ,</l>
     <l n="45">Where lakes and rivers burst upon the sight</l>
     <l n="46">And fill the mind with transports of delight ,</l>
     <l n="47">Where lofty hills unite with lowly dales</l>
     <l n="48">To furnish matter for instructive tales ,</l>
     <l n="49">There is a town , a very ancient town ,</l>
     <l n="50">Which , should enjoy a share of high renown .</l>
     <l n="51">My native place ! I need not sink the name —</l>
     <l n="52">Such act , sweet KENDAL ! thou might'st justly blame ,</l>
     <l n="53">A place so dear , I trust I still shall love ,</l>
     <l n="54">Where'er I am , or wheresoe'er I rove !</l>
     <l n="55">It has its site fast by a pleasant stream ,</l>
     <l n="56">Beside whose banks our hero learned to dream .</l>
     <l n="57">Though quiet , it gave birth to many a name ,</l>
     <l n="58">Which for good deeds obtained a moderate fame .</l>
     <l n="59">Some few there were well skilled in Science deep ,</l>
     <l n="60">Who now within its several graveyards sleep .</l>
     <l n="61">Its once-proud Castle that in ruin lies ,</l>
     <l n="62">The birthplace was of one who lived to rise</l>
     <l n="63">To queenly state , and sit upon a throne</l>
     <l n="64">And the eighth HENRY as her lord to own .</l>
     <l n="65">Within this town some very rich men live ;</l>
     <l n="66">But many more who poverty receive</l>
     <l n="67">As their low birthright , with the fullest share</l>
     <l n="68">Of its attendants , constant toil and care !</l>
     <l n="69">These oft , though poor , in honesty may vie</l>
     <l n="70">With most of those who hold their heads so high .</l>
     <l n="71">Of this large class young COOPER 'S parents were ;</l>
     <l n="72">To peace inclined , they heeded not the stir</l>
     <l n="73">Which proud Ambition 's votaries create</l>
     <l n="74">To gain such objects as their pride may sate .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="75">E'er since this father was a little boy ,</l>
     <l n="76">Hard out-door labor did his hands employ .</l>
     <l n="77">The mother , too , to work was early taught ,</l>
     <l n="78">And take delight in what her hands had wrought .</l>
     <l n="79">This hardy training proved of use to them ,</l>
     <l n="80">A blessing they did never once contemn ;</l>
     <l n="81">For ‘ twas the means of gaining honest bread —</l>
     <l n="82">And on no other would they e'er be fed !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="83">In course of time four children needed care ,</l>
     <l n="84">And claimed from them of food and clothes a share .</l>
     <l n="85">Nor did they grudge them what they could afford —</l>
     <l n="86">For they had learned to live and serve the Lord !</l>
     <l n="87">But soon Affliction , with her visage dire ,</l>
     <l n="88">Called them to pass through purifying fire !</l>
     <l n="89">And first a smiling girl was snatched away —</l>
     <l n="90">The mother next , to Death became a prey .</l>
     <l n="91">The father , too , was sick , and laid aside</l>
     <l n="92">For many weeks ; thus sorely was he tried .</l>
     <l n="93">Anon their pet , a lovely infant , died ,</l>
     <l n="94">And she was laid by her dear mother 's side .</l>
     <l n="95">Such fearful strokes , to one in poverty ,</l>
     <l n="96">Were hard to bear , as all may clearly see .</l>
     <l n="97">But this poor man , all strong in holy faith ,</l>
     <l n="98">Was led to take a proper view of death —</l>
     <l n="99">E'en to regard him as an enemy</l>
     <l n="100">Conquered by Him who died on Calvary —</l>
     <l n="101">And view his loved ones but as gone before .</l>
     <l n="102">To Canaan 's blest and truly happy shore !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="103">Ere long the Lord a partner did prepare</l>
     <l n="104">To aid this Christian , and his sorrow share .</l>
     <l n="105">She had for many years in service been ;</l>
     <l n="106">Of careful habits , in good pay I ween .</l>
     <l n="107">And this enabled her to lay aside</l>
     <l n="108">A goodly sum , and keep her needs supplied .</l>
     <l n="109">This virtuous woman thus became “ a crown ”</l>
     <l n="110">To that poor man , by trials well bowed down .</l>
     <l n="111">And by her cleverness in housewif'ry ,</l>
     <l n="112">With constant practice of economy ,</l>
     <l n="113">The family soon enjoyed a greater share</l>
     <l n="114">Of household comforts , and had much less care .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="115">Thus early schooled , our WILLIAM grew apace ,</l>
     <l n="116">And though still young , wore oft a thoughtful face .</l>
     <l n="117">By nature studious , and of ready turn ,</l>
     <l n="118">He needful tasks most eagerly did learn .</l>
     <l n="119">And being inquisitive , ‘ twas his desire</l>
     <l n="120">On winter nights , and by their frugal fire ,</l>
     <l n="121">That his dear father should to him make known</l>
     <l n="122">What kind of ancestry they chanced to own .</l>
     <l n="123">To this the father , with a smiling face ,</l>
     <l n="124">Soon made reply , “ We spring from noble race !</l>
     <l n="125">Long , long ago , I can in truth declare ,</l>
     <l n="126">A wandering Minstrel visited a fair ,</l>
     <l n="127">And there saw one of very noble blood ,</l>
     <l n="128">Who liked him well and deemed his music good .</l>
     <l n="129">They soon contrived each others ’ minds to learn ,</l>
     <l n="130">And felt Love 's flame within their bosoms burn ;</l>
     <l n="131">But knowing well this would not be allowed ,</l>
     <l n="132">Disguised , away they fled amongst a crowd .</l>
     <l n="133">Soon they were fast in honest wedlock tied ;</l>
     <l n="134">And thus the Minstrel gained a lovely bride !</l>
     <l n="135">Yet were they destined not to live in peace —</l>
     <l n="136">For ELLEN 'S brother vowed he would not cease</l>
     <l n="137">To search for them through all the country wide ,</l>
     <l n="138">And quick return with ELLEN at his side !</l>
     <l n="139">Long time he searched , then gave them up for lost ,</l>
     <l n="140">And proved his boasting vain , unto his cost .</l>
     <l n="141">But on one night he , weary , sad and faint ,</l>
     <l n="142">Espied a house , and to that house he went —</l>
     <l n="143">Just reached the threshold , and sank down quite spent .</l>
     <l n="144">The fair young mistress , with a piteous eye ,</l>
     <l n="145">Beheld the man , and feared that he would die .</l>
     <l n="146">She loosed his vest , then laid his bosom bare ,</l>
     <l n="147">And spied a mark which well might make her stare .</l>
     <l n="148">It was her brother ! and her gentle heart</l>
     <l n="149">With love o'erflowed to act a sister 's part .</l>
     <l n="150">Most earnest efforts quick the man restored ,</l>
     <l n="151">And ELLEN felt most grateful to the Lord .</l>
     <l n="152">She , fully conscious of strict rectitude ,</l>
     <l n="153">Confessed her kindred , and for pardon sued .</l>
     <l n="154">The astonished brother clasped her in his arms ;</l>
     <l n="155">Their early love afresh their spirit warms ,</l>
     <l n="156">And all his hatred very soon disarms .</l>
     <l n="157">This Minstrel , with his lovely ELLEN , were</l>
     <l n="158">Our ancestors , as you may well infer . ”</l>

     <l n="1">Young COOPER heard , and could not well conceal</l>
     <l n="2">Some stirring thoughts that he began to feel .</l>
     <l n="3">He still was of a very tender age ;</l>
     <l n="4">Far , far too young to feel Ambition 's rage .</l>
     <l n="5">But he had heard of Dukes , and Earls , and Lords ,</l>
     <l n="6">And all the splendor which their rank affords ;</l>
     <l n="7">Had seen in prints their castles and their halls ;</l>
     <l n="8">Had heard of servants who obeyed their calls ;</l>
     <l n="9">Of their vast parks , well filled with noble deer ,</l>
     <l n="10">Their tables loaded with the best of cheer ;</l>
     <l n="11">Of horses , carriages , and fleetest hounds ,</l>
     <l n="12">And cattle feeding over all their grounds ;</l>
     <l n="13">Of gardens filled with precious fruits and flowers ,</l>
     <l n="14">And of sweet music to beguile their hours ;</l>
     <l n="15">Fancied their mansions full of lovely girls ,</l>
     <l n="16">With beauteous eyes , and richly flowing curls ;</l>
     <l n="17">In short , conceived that these men were no less</l>
     <l n="18">Than mighty lords whom every eye should bless .</l>
     <l n="19">And ‘ twas no wonder if in reverie</l>
     <l n="20">This boy indulged with greatest frequency .</l>

     <l n="24">Would better health in change of air oft seek .</l>
     <l n="25">At times like these , his second mother 's care</l>
     <l n="26">Did send him forth with relatives to fare .</l>
     <l n="27">And then sweet Crossthwaite , with its paper mill ,</l>
     <l n="28">Its pretty brooks , and many a trickling rill ,</l>
     <l n="29">With dearest pleasure would his bosom fill .</l>
     <l n="30">Deep gratitude impels him now to pay</l>
     <l n="31">A tribute due to relatives , and say</l>
     <l n="32">That purer kindness could not be displayed</l>
     <l n="33">To any one who needed friendly aid ,</l>
     <l n="34">Than they still showed to him while living there ,</l>
     <l n="35">As their own child , he did their goodness share .</l>

     <l n="41">With yellow-blooming whins have banished far</l>
     <l n="42">All thoughts of his poor , weak and sickly frame ,</l>

     <l n="48">Again , fresh scenes would his attention crave ,</l>
     <l n="49">Ev'n noble Windermere with rippling wave ;</l>

     <l n="51">In huge flat-boats , or pleasant sailing wherry ,</l>
     <l n="52">And viewed , well pleased , its many lovely isles ,</l>
     <l n="53">Clothed with rich verdure and sweet Summer 's smiles ;</l>
     <l n="54">Or watched the fishes , darting to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="55">As o'er its crystal waves the boat would go ;</l>
     <l n="56">And still remembers those rich wooded hills ,</l>
     <l n="57">While deep emotion all his spirit thrills .</l>
     <l n="58">Sometimes tired Nature would assert her sway ,</l>
     <l n="59">Then gloomy thoughts rose up in dark array ;</l>
     <l n="60">He thus would wander , weary and alone ,</l>
     <l n="61">Listening the breezes in their fitful moan ,</l>
     <l n="62">As in their anger they swept through the woods ,</l>
     <l n="63">While thunder-clouds sent down their copious floods ,</l>
     <l n="64">And ask himself , in bitterness of soul ,</l>
     <l n="65">Why he his destiny could not control ?</l>
     <l n="66">Why some were wealthy , and could take their ease ,</l>
     <l n="67">And ride about wherever they should please ?</l>
     <l n="68">While he , poor lad , on foot his weary way</l>

     <l n="75">Just such a home , and with such comforts blest .</l>
     <l n="76">Sweet day-dreams these , quite frequently indulged ;</l>

     <l n="84">A mansion such as poets well might choose —</l>
     <l n="85">Fit habitation for the heaven-born Muse !</l>
     <l n="86">Well might he linger with entranced delight ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="100">Near this small lake does a rude hamlet stand ,</l>
     <l n="101">In which there dwelt a poor , hard-working band .</l>
     <l n="102">The parents , both , were well advanced in age ,</l>
     <l n="103">And yet , from kindness , they at once engage</l>
     <l n="104">To give this youth a welcome to their board ,</l>
     <l n="105">And all the comforts that their means afford .</l>
     <l n="106">To see him happy was their chief desire ,</l>
     <l n="107">Which did his soul with gratitude inspire .</l>
     <l n="108">They now are dead ! Oh , may their ashes rest</l>
     <l n="109">In peace , and still their memories be bless 'd !</l>
     <l n="110">WILLIAM oft thinks of all the pleasant scenes</l>
     <l n="111">He there enjoyed before he reached his teens ;</l>
     <l n="112">And well remembers how he loved to stray</l>
     <l n="113">By that pure lake , soon after break of day .</l>
     <l n="114">‘ Twas at such time , that once he chanced to spy</l>
     <l n="115">A splendid pike upon the beach quite dry</l>
     <l n="116">He viewed the prize ; it had not long been dead ,</l>
     <l n="117">As he well knew by looking at its head .</l>
     <l n="118">Surprised , he gazed about , on every hand ,</l>
     <l n="119">But saw no soul upon the lake or land ;</l>
     <l n="120">Then thought , since no one came the fish to claim ,</l>
     <l n="121">Take it he might , and yet incur no blame .</l>
     <l n="122">This settled in his mind , without delay</l>
     <l n="123">He seized the fish , and carried it away .</l>
     <l n="124">When he reached home , friends thought it would be best</l>
     <l n="125">‘ Gainst noon-tide hour to have it nicely dressed .</l>
     <l n="126">But candor now obliges me to say ,</l>
     <l n="127">That the right owner soon appeared next day ;</l>
     <l n="128">Who said he lately caught a noble pike ,</l>
     <l n="129">And laid it carefully beside a dyke ;</l>
     <l n="130">But , while he went still farther up the lake ,</l>
     <l n="131">To draw some lines , and other fishes take ,</l>
     <l n="132">A dog , or person , had purloined that one :</l>
     <l n="133">A cousin told him WILL the deed had done !</l>
     <l n="134">Told how he brought to them , with boyish glee ,</l>
     <l n="135">As fine a pike as ever one could see !</l>
     <l n="136">This heard , the loser took it in good part ,</l>

     <l n="145">An incident I now would introduce</l>

     <l n="147">In leading youths to greater carefulness ,</l>
     <l n="148">When to sweet pleasure they themselves address .</l>
     <l n="149">Near Esthwaite 's foot exists a lonely spot ,</l>
     <l n="150">Named by the country people “ The Priest 's Pot ” ;</l>
     <l n="151">A strange , deep hole , with crystal water filled ,</l>
     <l n="152">By land surrounded which was never tilled ;</l>
     <l n="153">Of spongy texture , yielding to the foot —</l>
     <l n="154">Quite full of danger is this marshy spot .</l>
     <l n="155">To this place WILLIAM once a fishing went ,</l>
     <l n="156">And , ere his patience was completely spent ,</l>
     <l n="157">Took up a fresh position ; but , alas !</l>
     <l n="158">His foothold proved but little else than grass .</l>
     <l n="159">While sinking fast he , with a fluttering heart ,</l>
     <l n="160">Gave one quick spring and reached a firmer part .</l>
     <l n="161">This proved a lesson which he ne'er forgot —</l>
     <l n="162">He visited no more that dreaded spot .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="163">Before this time , for years , he went to school ,</l>
     <l n="164">And caught some learning by the common rule ;</l>
     <l n="165">In parsing showed a fair amount of skill ,</l>
     <l n="166">Wrote a plain hand , and read with right good will ;</l>
     <l n="167">Almost a “ book-worm , ” seemed he to devour</l>
     <l n="168">What books he got , and read from hour to hour .</l>
     <l n="169">And , oh ! how pleased and gratified was he ,</l>
     <l n="170">To hear the Master read sweet poetry !</l>
     <l n="171">Once he read well a very touching tale ,</l>
     <l n="172">In which the Poet does the lot bewail</l>
     <l n="173">Of orphan “ Lubin , ” who , while tending sheep</l>
     <l n="174">For a hard master , oft was seen to weep .</l>
     <l n="175">While this pathetic tale was read aloud ,</l>
     <l n="176">The tears to WILLIAM 'S eyes would quickly crowd ;</l>
     <l n="177">And from that time a Poet he became —</l>
     <l n="178">In joy or sorrow felt a glowing flame .</l>
     <l n="179">Though still so young he , at this very time ,</l>
     <l n="180">Oft framed rude numbers , and poured forth his rhyme ;</l>
     <l n="181">And ‘ twas no wonder if , by Nature taught ,</l>
     <l n="182">He wrapped himself in sweet poetic thought .</l>
     <l n="183">He , to this day , is pleased to recollect</l>
     <l n="184">What few , who knew him then , would e'er suspect —</l>
     <l n="185">How much he loved to wander in the woods ,</l>
     <l n="186">And watch the trees put forth their opening buds ;</l>
     <l n="187">Or list the sound created by the wind ,</l>
     <l n="188">Which sought a passage through the leaves to find .</l>
     <l n="189">He also loved , with wonder and delight ,</l>
     <l n="190">To gaze on flowers bedecked with glory bright ;</l>
     <l n="191">On polyanthus and auriculas ,</l>
     <l n="192">In pleasing contrast with the ribbon-grass ;</l>
     <l n="193">On wall-flower , too , with richest odor filled ,</l>
     <l n="194">Like sweet frankincense daintily distilled ;</l>
     <l n="195">On roses fair , in great variety</l>
     <l n="196">Of scent and color ; and the peony ,</l>
     <l n="197">Or scented violet , which scarce shows its head ,</l>
     <l n="198">Yet does its odor o'er the garden shed ;</l>
     <l n="199">On prince 's feather , wearing stately plume ,</l>
     <l n="200">With much of show , but nothing of perfume ;</l>
     <l n="201">Loved tulips , lilies , pinks and gilliflowers ,</l>
     <l n="202">With woodbines trained o'er lovely garden bowers ,</l>
     <l n="203">That give forth sweetness and their charms display ,</l>
     <l n="204">While , in rich robes , they stand in full array ;</l>
     <l n="205">The foxglove , daisy , and demure monk'shYpppHeNhood ,</l>
     <l n="206">With lilacs , and the scented southern wood ;</l>
     <l n="207">The guelder-rose , with its fair , whited balls ,</l>
     <l n="208">And creeping plants , high climbing up the walls ,</l>
     <l n="209">These at all times our hero warmly loved ,</l>
     <l n="210">And showed it , too , when he in gardens roved .</l>
     <l n="211">While , to himself , he had a patch of ground ,</l>
     <l n="212">Where , at his leisure , he was mostly found .</l>
     <l n="213">Thus passed , most pleasantly , his youthful days ,</l>
     <l n="214">All intermingled with his boyish plays ,</l>
     <l n="215">And sometimes meriting a need of praise .</l>

     <l n="341">He faithful wrought , as in his Master 's sight .</l>
     <l n="342">Yet oft he wished — that wish was strongest then —</l>
     <l n="343">Improvement in his learning to obtain ;</l>
     <l n="344">But , such love frolics made that wish in vain .</l>
     <l n="345">This grieved him much when , afterwards , desire</l>
     <l n="346">He felt to nurture true poetic fire ;</l>
     <l n="347">And did regret that youthful follies cost</l>
     <l n="348">So much in precious time forever lost .</l>
     <l n="349">This folly seen , he strove with eager haste</l>
     <l n="350">To let his leisure run no more to waste ,</l>
     <l n="351">And rose each morn at four or five o'clock ,</l>
     <l n="352">To walk abroad , and gain of health a stock ;</l>
     <l n="353">Or listen to the lark 's sweet morning lay ,</l>
     <l n="354">As he rose up to greet the King of Day ;</l>
     <l n="355">Or let the lively , thrilling blackbird 's song ,</l>
     <l n="356">Charm his fond ear as he walked slow along .</l>
     <l n="357">Sometimes through well-fenced fields of new-mown hay —</l>
     <l n="358">Breathing out fragrance — he was wont to stray ;</l>
     <l n="359">Or climb a bill with firm , elastic tread ,</l>
     <l n="360">While Sol his early beams in radiance shed .</l>
     <l n="361">The Castle hill he mostly did prefer ,</l>
     <l n="362">As quite accordant with his character .</l>
     <l n="363">Upon its ruins he would musing sit ,</l>
     <l n="364">Till he was seized with a strong rhyming fit ;</l>
     <l n="365">Then frame his welling thoughts to some rude verse —</l>
     <l n="366">Which friends were anxious he should oft rehearse .</l>
     <l n="367">If thus his leisure was not always spent ,</l>
     <l n="368">He read what books his friends had to him lent .</l>
     <l n="369">Of such good things he owned but very few —</l>
     <l n="370">And parents needed all the cash he drew .</l>
     <l n="371">Thus was his time most constantly employed ,</l>
     <l n="372">While life passed smoothly on — not unenjoyed .</l>

     <l n="1">Hail , Holidays ! To you , with great delight ,</l>
     <l n="2">The schoolboy looks — exulting with his might</l>
     <l n="3">At the fair prospect of enjoying play ,</l>
     <l n="4">Or visiting relations far away .</l>
     <l n="5">Ere your propitious dawn he lays his schemes ,</l>
     <l n="6">And pleased , rejoices in his bright day dreams .</l>
     <l n="7">He , in anticipation , views the charm</l>
     <l n="8">Of being for days exempt from birchen harm !</l>
     <l n="9">When , free from tasks — nor caring much for books —</l>
     <l n="10">With some companion he can fish the brooks ;</l>
     <l n="11">Can ramble through the woods for flowers or nuts ,</l>
     <l n="12">Play with fair girls who live in sylvan huts ,</l>
     <l n="13">Mount with agility some green hill top ,</l>
     <l n="14">And , with a mate , roll full length down the slope ;</l>
     <l n="15">Or take his fill from loaded bramble bushes ,</l>
     <l n="16">Or from rich fruit bedecked in Autumn 's blushes .</l>
     <l n="17">Such is the bliss that 's placed before his view ,</l>
     <l n="18">In all its fulness , Holidays ! by you .</l>
     <l n="19">And thus , without a single shade of sorrow ,</l>
     <l n="20">He greets his mates with “ Holiday to-morrow ! ”</l>
     <l n="21">These pleasures seem unto his boyish mind</l>
     <l n="22">Of the right sort — and for schoolboys designed .</l>
     <l n="23">He seldom thinks of all the anxious care</l>
     <l n="24">His parents feel , to give their son a share</l>
     <l n="25">Of useful learning , that he may discharge</l>
     <l n="26">His part to God , to them , and men at large .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="27">Apprentices as well with pleasure hail</l>
     <l n="28">Their holidays — O , may they never fail !</l>
     <l n="29">These are too often spent in idleness ,</l>
     <l n="30">Or such sad courses as brings them distress .</l>
     <l n="31">This is the case when grog-shops they frequent ;</l>
     <l n="32">For ruin follows time and means ill spent .</l>
     <l n="33">Pause , O , ye youths ! before you yet begin</l>
     <l n="34">A course that may lead you to every sin !</l>
     <l n="35">Restrain your feet from entering those holes</l>
     <l n="36">Which prove the ruin of so many souls .</l>
     <l n="37">Would ye not pause , if right across your path</l>
     <l n="38">There lay a monstrous serpent , full of wrath ?</l>
     <l n="39">Would we , fool-hardy , rush into his jaws</l>
     <l n="40">To certain death ? or would ye rather pause ?</l>
     <l n="41">Youths , ye have cause , yea , weighty cause , to dread</l>
     <l n="42">This horrid serpent , on strong liquor fed ,</l>
     <l n="43">Which lurks in every place where Rum is sold ,</l>
     <l n="44">Though they may be all covered o'er with gold —</l>
     <l n="45">They often are ; nor deem it hard of faith —</l>
     <l n="46">The way to present and eternal death !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="47">God does by His most holy Book declare ,</l>
     <l n="48">“ Into God 's kingdom none shall enter there ,</l>
     <l n="49">Who liquor drink till drunkards they become ! ”</l>
     <l n="50">Yet , day by day , some meet this awful doom .</l>
     <l n="51">Oh , warning take ! Flee from this dreadful crime !</l>
     <l n="52">Pause and consider , while you yet have time !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="53">Listen the story which to you I tell ;</l>
     <l n="54">Dwell on its moral — mark the sequel well ;</l>
     <l n="55">Then look abroad , and see its counterpart</l>
     <l n="56">In many a case that shows a broken heart .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="57">DAYCOURT was a youth , possessed of wealth —</l>
     <l n="58">Had manly beauty and the best of health ;</l>
     <l n="59">In learning he excelled — was quite a wit —</l>
     <l n="60">And oft indulged in a deep musing fit .</l>
     <l n="61">Of very warm and truly tender heart ,</l>
     <l n="62">He did his best to act a proper part ;</l>
     <l n="63">Which made him much respected all around —</l>
     <l n="64">Against him , filled with envy , none were found .</l>
     <l n="65">His widowed mother , then , might well be proud</l>
     <l n="66">Of such a son , and speak his praises loud .</l>
     <l n="67">He bore for her respect , and strove to prove</l>
     <l n="68">In many ways the fulness of his love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="69">For many years this widow , in her grief ,</l>
     <l n="70">Looked up to God , and found from him relief .</l>
     <l n="71">She knew the Lord , before her husband died ,</l>
     <l n="72">And found Him one in whom she could confide ;</l>
     <l n="73">In all her trials meekly bowed her head ,</l>
     <l n="74">And found sweet peace was o'er her bosom shed .</l>
     <l n="75">Her son , to her , was all a son could be —</l>
     <l n="76">Yet on one point she felt anxiety :</l>
     <l n="77">He had not then experienced the New Birth ,</l>
     <l n="78">And his best thoughts had all been of the Earth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="79">Adjoining their estate was living one —</l>
     <l n="80">A blithe young lady , who in beauty shone ;</l>
     <l n="81">With health endowed , and with fair learning graced ,</l>
     <l n="82">By wealth in easy circumstances placed .</l>
     <l n="83">AMELIA DOVE we well may call her name —</l>
     <l n="84">Like that sweet bird she seemed exempt from blame .</l>
     <l n="85">Her parents loved her — they could do no less —</l>
     <l n="86">She was the soul of all their happiness !</l>
     <l n="87">Early she rose , and , dressed in neat array ,</l>
     <l n="88">Assisted her dear mother through the day .</l>
     <l n="89">Thus passed her time , beloved by all around —</l>
     <l n="90">She was as good a girl as could be found ;</l>
     <l n="91">And a fair match for DAYCOURT all conceived —</l>
     <l n="92">This he himself had for some time believed .</l>
     <l n="93">They loved each other , and obtained consent</l>
     <l n="94">From their kind parents , and were well content .</l>
     <l n="95">And , having leisure , they would often walk ,</l>
     <l n="96">Or , sitting in some bower , would sing and talk ;</l>
     <l n="97">Or else they read some book which both admired ,</l>
     <l n="98">Till their young hearts with ecstacy were fired ;</l>
     <l n="99">Through hill and dale — through woods — were wont to rove ,</l>
     <l n="100">Well pleased with all they saw , they drank in love !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="101">The day arrived when DAYCOURT and his bride</l>
     <l n="102">Were at the altar in pure wedlock tied .</l>
     <l n="103">The day was spent as such like days have been ,</l>
     <l n="104">And passed away in happiness serene .</l>
     <l n="105">At night , a bounteous marriage-feast was spread ,</l>
     <l n="106">And Love 's sweet influence over all seemed shed .</l>
     <l n="107">The friends invited strove to show their joy ,</l>
     <l n="108">In wishing happiness without alloy</l>
     <l n="109">To that young couple , who , in youthful bloom ,</l>
     <l n="110">Were the admired of all in that large room .</l>
     <l n="111">But , Oh ! I shrink ! ‘ Tis my ungracious task</l>
     <l n="112">From bliss like this to tear away the mask !</l>
     <l n="113">On such occasions wine 's oft made to flow —</l>
     <l n="114">As if it were the source of joy below !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="115">The bridegroom felt in a most merry mood ,</l>
     <l n="116">And drank each health till his young , joyous blood</l>
     <l n="117">Coursed through his veins as if quite all on fire ,</l>
     <l n="118">And his kind thoughts gave place to bad desire .</l>
     <l n="119">His brain began to whirl — he boisterous grew —</l>
     <l n="120">All eyes on him , observant , quickly drew —</l>
     <l n="121">He seized a bottle , which he madly threw .</l>
     <l n="122">Sad to relate ! it struck his beauteous bride !</l>
     <l n="123">And she fell dead , by her dear mother 's side .</l>
     <l n="124">This dread catastrophe soon sobered him ,</l>
     <l n="125">And he was sick , and felt his eyes grow dim .</l>
     <l n="126">But while all stood in terror and dismay ,</l>
     <l n="127">He roused himself , and fled from thence away ;</l>
     <l n="128">Then headlong rushed into a deep , deep , stream —</l>
     <l n="129">And thus was ended that bright , youthful dream !</l>
     <l n="130">The pious mother tried in God to trust ,</l>
     <l n="131">But this dire blow soon sank her in the dust .</l>
     <l n="132">Her parents , too , felt this most dreadful stroke</l>
     <l n="133">Too hard to bear , for both their hearts it broke !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="134">Oh , cruel Liquor ! Thou hast millions slain ,</l>
     <l n="135">And still their death-throes cry to thee in vain !</l>
     <l n="136">Ten thousand broken hearts may soon be found</l>
     <l n="137">In almost every land the world around .</l>
     <l n="138">Millions of orphans ’ cries thine ears assail ,</l>
     <l n="139">While parents ’ early death they loud bewail ;</l>
     <l n="140">The prisons and asylums which we build ,</l>
     <l n="141">From thy sad victims ’ ranks are chiefly filled .</l>
     <l n="142">War 's dreadful ravages are justly blamed ;</l>
     <l n="143">But war with thee deserves not to be named !</l>
     <l n="144">And still , insatiate monster ! thy dread jaws</l>
     <l n="145">Are daily filled — being unrestrained by laws !</l>
     <l n="146">When will the day , the happy day , arrive ,</l>
     <l n="147">When thee the injured nations forth shall drive ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="148">Beware , Apprentices ! In time beware !</l>
     <l n="149">Flee from those places which would you insnare ;</l>
     <l n="150">Regard that man as your real enemy ,</l>
     <l n="151">Who , tempting , leads to inebriety !</l>
     <l n="152">Now , while you daily toil , I wish you may</l>
     <l n="153">Have many a truly happy holiday !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="154">The hero of my tale of such had some ,</l>
     <l n="155">And felt well pleased whenever they did come .</l>
     <l n="156">On such occasions he was wont to go</l>
     <l n="157">To visit friends , who did much kindness show .</l>
     <l n="158">With ardent joy full beaming in his face ,</l>
     <l n="159">He more than once revisited the place</l>
     <l n="160">Where his dear father spent his youthful days ,</l>
     <l n="161">In toilsome labor , or in childish plays .</l>
     <l n="162">To him ‘ twas still a sweetly quiet spot ,</l>
     <l n="163">A picture of content — a small , neat cot —</l>
     <l n="164">And just beneath the hill called Farleton Knot .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="165">He had a strange , romantic turn of mind ;</l>
     <l n="166">To taste adventure ever felt inclined .</l>
     <l n="167">This being premised , we may expect to see ,</l>
     <l n="168">That by slight dangers undeterred was he</l>
     <l n="169">From venturing to the edge of precipice ,</l>
     <l n="170">To have a peep into some dark abyss .</l>
     <l n="171">The hill of which I spoke has sometimes been ,</l>
     <l n="172">As was well known , the site of tragic scene .</l>
     <l n="173">It is a solid mass of limestone rock —</l>
     <l n="174">And there oft falls some huge misshapen block .</l>
     <l n="175">On one occasion a poor quarryman</l>
     <l n="176">Saw danger pending , and away he ran ;</l>
     <l n="177">‘ Twas all in vain ! the lately-riven stone</l>
     <l n="178">Came thundering down , and crushed his every bone !</l>
     <l n="179">A tale like this might well some minds appal —</l>
     <l n="180">But WILLIAM felt , just then , of dauntless soul ;</l>
     <l n="181">And , with his cousin , hasted up the hill ,</l>
     <l n="182">With eager steps and most unyielding will ;</l>
     <l n="183">A scene there met his gaze which him repaid ,</l>
     <l n="184">And threw the toil required far in the shade .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="185">On every hand a charming prospect lay ,</l>
     <l n="186">In all the beauty of a bright Spring day .</l>
     <l n="187">All Nature smiled , in loveliest green confessed ,</l>
     <l n="188">Like a fair maiden for her bridal drest .</l>
     <l n="189">And songsters of the grove , no longer sad ,</l>
     <l n="190">Their notes were warbling forth to make her glad .</l>
     <l n="191">And need we wonder then , if there he stood ,</l>
     <l n="192">With glowing heart , and wrapt in musing mood ?</l>
     <l n="193">As was his wont , he felt a strong desire</l>
     <l n="194">From such sweet views to draw poetic fire .</l>
     <l n="195">And so it was , for out his numbers flowed ,</l>
     <l n="196">Which , quickly penned , he on his friends bestowed .</l>
     <l n="197">And though these numbers were but very rude ,</l>
     <l n="198">They were , by rustic friends , with wonder viewed .</l>
     <l n="199">While he stood there his thoughts were backward thrown</l>
     <l n="200">To days which on Time 's fleetest wing had flown —</l>
     <l n="201">When his grandfather , in that humble cot ,</l>
     <l n="202">With sweet contentedness enjoyed his lot ;</l>
     <l n="203">Wrought quietly at his most lowly trade ,</l>
     <l n="204">And honest lived — though small the profits made .</l>
     <l n="205">In his mind 's eye , he saw his father climb</l>
     <l n="206">Those rugged cliffs , in youth , or manhood 's prime ;</l>
     <l n="207">Or , with his brothers join in lively play ,</l>
     <l n="208">On the long evenings of each Summer day .</l>
     <l n="209">Anon would view the time when each forsook</l>
     <l n="210">That humble cottage , some fresh toil to brook ;</l>
     <l n="211">Saw them all settled in a wedded life —</l>
     <l n="212">In honest work employed , exempt from strife .</l>
     <l n="213">Or glanced at some of his own early days —</l>
     <l n="214">When he gave up , on Saturdays , his plays ,</l>
     <l n="215">To go with his dear grandfather , to sell</l>
     <l n="216">The neat bee-hives the old man framed so well .</l>
     <l n="217">And often wondered what made selfish men</l>
     <l n="218">Try at less price those bee-hives to obtain ;</l>
     <l n="219">And why the tears would oft the eyes bedim</l>
     <l n="220">Of that old man , when they thus bantered him ?</l>
     <l n="221">And then with lightning speed his thoughts would stray ,</l>
     <l n="222">To when his grandfather was ta'en away ,</l>
     <l n="223">To meet in church-yard with his kindred clay .</l>
     <l n="224">As thus he stood and mused , his cousin 's call</l>
     <l n="225">Roused him again to consciousness of all</l>
     <l n="226">The widespread beauties of that landscape bright</l>
     <l n="227">And he , reluctant , left the beauteous sight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="228">To hint at all he saw my time would fail ,</l>
     <l n="229">And might too much but lengthen out my tale .</l>
     <l n="230">Suffice it , therefore , just for me to say ,</l>
     <l n="231">That he spent pleasantly each holiday .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="232">Ere this , when he was in his fourteenth year ,</l>
     <l n="233">Amongst the Temperance ranks he did appear ;</l>
     <l n="234">Attended meetings , heard the speeches made ,</l>
     <l n="235">And grew indignant at the liquor trade .</l>
     <l n="236">He signed the pledge — the strict “ teetotal ” pledge —</l>
     <l n="237">And felt determined constant war to wage</l>
     <l n="238">Against the huge , fierce monster , Drunkenness</l>
     <l n="239">Which caused , on every hand , such sore distress .</l>
     <l n="240">A drunken parent he had never had —</l>
     <l n="241">The Lord preserved him from a fate so sad !</l>
     <l n="242">But still his fervent soul was filled with grief ,</l>
     <l n="243">From which he vainly strove to gain relief ,</l>
     <l n="244">So long as this dread vice o'erspread the land ,</l>
     <l n="245">And strong drink 's victims died , on every hand .</l>
     <l n="246">He thought upon the thing till bold he grew ,</l>
     <l n="247">And framed a speech to tell of all he knew</l>
     <l n="248">Of this vile demon 's doings in the world ,</l>
     <l n="249">And wished that out of it he might be hurled .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="250">Soon after this , from Canada there came</l>
     <l n="251">A Christian man ; no matter what his name .</l>
     <l n="252">He long to WILLIAM 'S parents had been known ,</l>
     <l n="253">And hospitality to him was shown .</l>
     <l n="254">On that good country 's merits much he dwelt ,</l>
     <l n="255">And COOPER 'S ears being open , soon he felt</l>
     <l n="256">A strong desire to reach that distant shore ,</l>
     <l n="257">And all its giant wonders to explore .</l>
     <l n="258">Oft he had heard of its vast , splendid lakes ,</l>
     <l n="259">Stupendous cataracts , and great cane-brakes ;</l>
     <l n="260">Of boundless woods , well filled with noble trees</l>
     <l n="261">And hugest rivers rolling to the seas .</l>
     <l n="262">The man described quite well Niagara 's falls ,</l>
     <l n="263">Its thundering sound as it o'erleaps its walls ;</l>
     <l n="264">He told the distance they could hear the sound ,</l>
     <l n="265">And how with ceaseless roar it shook the ground ;</l>
     <l n="266">Of Summer 's heat , of the long Winter 's cold ,</l>
     <l n="267">And at what price the finest lands were sold .</l>
     <l n="268">This , and far more , the settler told the youth ,</l>
     <l n="269">Who did regard it all as sterling truth ,</l>
     <l n="270">And wished — but wished in vain — that he was free</l>
     <l n="271">To cross at once the stormy , deep blue sea .</l>
     <l n="272">No way appeared but quietly to wait</l>
     <l n="273">Till he was loosed , and grown to man 's estate .</l>
     <l n="274">Some years must pass before that day arrive ,</l>
     <l n="275">So to be patient he thought fit to strive .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="276">One-half of his apprenticeship had fled ,</l>
     <l n="277">And now he fairly earned his daily bread .</l>
     <l n="278">Of clothes , his parents ’ ever constant care</l>
     <l n="279">Provided him with quite a decent share .</l>
     <l n="280">Of pocket money he ne'er had a store ,</l>
     <l n="281">His needs supplied , he did not care for more ;</l>
     <l n="282">And his step-mother oft thought fit to say</l>
     <l n="283">That “ money burned his pockets all away . ”</l>
     <l n="284">Howe'er it was , he never had a cent</l>
     <l n="285">But found a hole , and out of that it went !</l>
     <l n="286">Though still close-worked , he did contrive to spare</l>
     <l n="287">Some precious , time to spend in rhyming ware .</l>
     <l n="288">He read sweet COWPER 'S poems through and through —</l>
     <l n="289">And , more he read , the more he liked them , too ;</l>
     <l n="290">His “ Task ” the most of all — an ample field —</l>
     <l n="291">What heart-felt pleasure it did to him yield !</l>
     <l n="292">Then MILTON 'S lofty genius fired his soul ,</l>
     <l n="293">Nor did he tire till he had read the whole .</l>
     <l n="294">Again began , and o'er the pages pored ,</l>
     <l n="295">And drank the sweets with which they are well stored .</l>
     <l n="296">Then THOMPSON 'S Seasons with delight he read ,</l>
     <l n="297">And YOUNG 'S Night Thoughts in mournful dress arrayed .</l>
     <l n="298">Some few sweet pieces he from BYRON drew ,</l>
     <l n="299">And read poor BURNS with much advantage , too .</l>
     <l n="300">But of all poets he loved COWPER most ,</l>
     <l n="301">For in Miltonic grandeur he was lost ;</l>
     <l n="302">And THOMSON lacked that great variety</l>
     <l n="303">Which in sweet Olney 's bard we clearly see .</l>
     <l n="304">Afflicted Poet ! Thou didst well thy part ,</l>
     <l n="305">By pouring balm into the wounded heart ;</l>
     <l n="306">And while the world endures , thy verse will cheer</l>

     <l n="308">Nor did he read alone the poet 's page ,</l>
     <l n="309">Good books in prose would oft his mind engage :</l>
     <l n="310">For he had joined th ’ Mechanics ’ Institute —</l>

     <l n="312">Mechanics ! It deserves your best support ,</l>

     <l n="11">Thy pages do unfold the wondrous plan</l>
     <l n="12">By which that Savior has redeemed lost man !</l>

     <l n="20">Forever shall be saved from death and sin ,</l>
     <l n="21">And feel “ Eternal Life , ” while here , begin ;</l>

     <l n="25">True civilization 's first and greatest cause !</l>
     <l n="26">A code of morals on thy page is writ</l>
     <l n="27">To regulate men 's lives , and conscience fit .</l>

     <l n="49">When he first saw his heart and conduct foul —</l>
     <l n="50">Was led to view God 's holy law aright ,</l>
     <l n="51">And know he was condemned in His just sight .</l>
     <l n="52">Then , what true joy did Jesus ’ love inspire !</l>
     <l n="53">It kindled in his heart sincere desire</l>
     <l n="54">To leave , at once , the World 's wild , giddy throng ,</l>
     <l n="55">Whose joy and pleasures all to Earth belong ,</l>
     <l n="56">To join with those whose joys are from Above ,</l>
     <l n="57">And who have tasted of a Savior 's love .</l>

     <l n="59">For Christian fellowship ; nor was denied .</l>
     <l n="60">All those kind brethren hearty welcome gave ,</l>

     <l n="63">To whom the new-made members they commend .</l>
     <l n="64">An Elder , grave , gave each an exhortation ,</l>

     <l n="68">The Bible then became his choicest friend ;</l>
     <l n="69">At home , abroad , did all his steps attend ,</l>

     <l n="74">He takes delight — in spirit sings and prays .</l>
     <l n="75">Views Family Worship as an altar raised</l>
     <l n="76">To the true God , who should be always praised .</l>
     <l n="77">And now , whene'er he takes his walks abroad ,</l>
     <l n="78">Hears Nature 's voice well tuned in praise of God .</l>
     <l n="79">Each blade of grass that springs beneath his feet ,</l>

     <l n="81">The flowers that to his eyes their charms disclose ,</l>
     <l n="82">The waving grain , and every tree that grows ,</l>
     <l n="83">Each insect fluttering in the bright sunbeams ,</l>
     <l n="84">Or fishes sporting in pure crystal streams ,</l>
     <l n="85">Or birds that raise their songs by morning light ,</l>
     <l n="86">At High mid day , or through the moonlit night ;</l>
     <l n="87">Each storm that rises , or pure breeze that blows ,</l>
     <l n="88">The copious rains , or Winter 's drifting snows ,</l>
     <l n="89">Vast mountains rearing their hoar heads on high ,</l>
     <l n="90">Each gem-like star set in the fair blue sky ;</l>
     <l n="91">The herds wide feeding in the fields around ,</l>
     <l n="92">All living things in every country found ,</l>
     <l n="93">All these in their peculiar ways give forth</l>
     <l n="94">Praises to God , the Author of their birth !</l>
     <l n="95">“ Then , why are Men so silent ? ” he 'd exclaim ;</l>

     <l n="98">Why rise they not above the things of Earth ? ”</l>
     <l n="99">The “ why ” to WILLIAM , in his warm first love ,</l>
     <l n="100">Did truly seem most difficult to prove .</l>
     <l n="101">He by experience knew but little then</l>
     <l n="102">Of the sad trials of his fellow men ;</l>
     <l n="103">Nor e'er suspected that the flesh remains</l>
     <l n="104">In each poor sinner who true faith obtains .</l>
     <l n="105">This bitter truth he soon was made to feel ,</l>
     <l n="106">Which greatly damped his young and ardent zeal .</l>
     <l n="107">How humbling was the thought that human pride</l>
     <l n="108">Within God 's children must be mortified !</l>
     <l n="109">“ Salvation all of Grace ” first cuts the roots ,</l>
     <l n="110">Then the huge blanches , and the smallest shoots ,</l>
     <l n="111">Lays bare the fact , that all of Adam 's race</l>
     <l n="112">Are but vile sinners , and in woful case .</l>
     <l n="113">That the most moral among human kind ,</l>
     <l n="114">As the most vicious , are to sin inclined .</l>
     <l n="115">And if not saved by Grace , not saved at all ,</l>
     <l n="116">But are hell-doomed , and held in Satan 's thrall !</l>
     <l n="117">While endless ruin stands before their view ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="119">This Scripture truth was soon by WILLIAM seen ,</l>

     <l n="121">Used to the teachings of God 's holy word ,</l>
     <l n="122">So that with it his mind was early stored .</l>
     <l n="123">However strange indeed it may appear</l>
     <l n="124">To some men 's minds , he felt no cause to fear :</l>
     <l n="125">For though this truth had stripped him of all worth</l>
     <l n="126">In sight of God , it called his praises forth ,</l>
     <l n="127">By showing him Salvation full and free</l>
     <l n="128">To sinners , whatsoe'er their age , sex or degree ,</l>
     <l n="129">Who credit the account that God has given</l>
     <l n="130">Of Jesus Christ — the precious gift of Heaven !</l>
     <l n="131">Now , feeling truly happy in his soul ,</l>
     <l n="132">He felt most free to speak the Truth to all ;</l>
     <l n="133">That , if by any means , he might succeed</l>
     <l n="134">In saving souls , of whatsoever creed .</l>
     <l n="135">His shop-mates saw the difference with surprise ,</l>
     <l n="136">And at his cost indulged in foul surmise .</l>
     <l n="137">He heeded not , but placed in God his trust —</l>
     <l n="138">To his employer still continued just —</l>
     <l n="139">And strove with all his might to rectify</l>
     <l n="140">Each thing improper which he chanced to spy ;</l>
     <l n="141">That his old master might have no complaint</l>
     <l n="142">Against his servant for thus turning Saint .</l>
     <l n="143">He plied his trade from better motives now ,</l>
     <l n="144">As God with wisdom did his mind endow ,</l>
     <l n="145">And to his just commands led him to bow .</l>
     <l n="146">By such a course pursued he did enjoy</l>
     <l n="147">True peace of mind — though not without alloy .</l>
     <l n="148">And Time , who past him flew on fleetest wing ,</l>
     <l n="149">New joys , new sorrows , to his mind did bring .</l>
     <l n="150">At times he still was caught in Love 's sweet snare ,</l>
     <l n="151">Which of fresh trials brought no little share .</l>
     <l n="152">He was by nature very apt to fall</l>
     <l n="153">So deep in love , it did his mind enthral .</l>
     <l n="154">Yet clothed in purity was his desire ,</l>
     <l n="155">Nor e'er to rank unequal did aspire .</l>
     <l n="156">One thing to this time had his thoughts possessed —</l>
     <l n="157">“ To have the girl that pleased his fancy best . ”</l>
     <l n="158">He had not noticed what the Word declares</l>
     <l n="159">On this great matter , so that in his prayers</l>
     <l n="160">He ne'er had asked the Lord to him direct ,</l>
     <l n="161">And disappointment came for this neglect .</l>
     <l n="162">‘ Midst doubts and fears he therefore put away</l>
     <l n="163">All thoughts of marriage to a future day .</l>

     <l n="168">Few weightier matters can attention claim ,</l>

     <l n="3">England by thee for centuries has been blest ;</l>
     <l n="4">Thy worth to her can scarcely be express 'd .</l>
     <l n="5">By thy facilities the Scriptures spread</l>
     <l n="6">From shore to shore , on God 's own errands sped !</l>

     <l n="8">While each fair port a thriving aspect wears .</l>
     <l n="9">Millions of gold by thee are well employed ,</l>
     <l n="10">And the rich profits by each class enjoyed .</l>
     <l n="11">Through thee great Nature 's overflowing stores</l>
     <l n="12">From distant lands are brought unto our doors ;</l>
     <l n="13">Increasing much our comfort and delight ,</l>
     <l n="14">Without abating any civil right .</l>
     <l n="15">Nay , more ; producing , by thy sway , sweet bands</l>
     <l n="16">To bind us to give Peace our hearts and hands ;</l>
     <l n="17">And thus to strike a death-blow to all war ,</l>
     <l n="18">Whose brutal spirit keeps our minds ajar .</l>
     <l n="19">Through thee our mammoth manufacturing places</l>
     <l n="20">Send forth their wares to Earth 's remotest races :</l>
     <l n="21">By which means many thousand poor are fed ,</l>
     <l n="22">And trained to Industry — by Virtue led —</l>
     <l n="23">Use right the skill with which they are endowed ;</l>
     <l n="24">Of such like men may England long be proud ,</l>
     <l n="25">And ever foster , by good wholesome laws ,</l>
     <l n="26">Those trades which help so mightily her cause !</l>

     <l n="302">When they sprang sideways with their heavy load .</l>
     <l n="303">Quick as a lightning 's flash the log they drew</l>

     <l n="311">One more slight move would surely crush his head ;</l>

     <l n="320">Though feeling much as if his blood was froze .</l>
     <l n="321">To parent 's kind inquiries he replied ,</l>

     <l n="326">For God 's deliverance — so clearly seen .</l>
     <l n="327">A few short hours sufficed to bring him round ,</l>
     <l n="328">And he at logging speedily was found .</l>
     <l n="329">There still was something in this wild bush-life</l>
     <l n="330">To suit a mind ne'er formed for worldly strife .</l>
     <l n="331">The chopper 's quick reverberating stroke —</l>
     <l n="332">The well-trained oxen , toiling in the yoke —</l>
     <l n="333">The distant cow-bell 's ever-changing sound —</l>
     <l n="334">The new-chopped tree 's deep thundering on the ground ;</l>
     <l n="335">The patter of the rain on forest leaves ,</l>
     <l n="336">The tree-frog 's pipe , which oft the ear deceives ,</l>
     <l n="337">The blazing log-heaps , and the rude rail fence —</l>
     <l n="338">The wild-bee 's hum of gratitude intense</l>
     <l n="339">For hoards of honey , which our woods still yield ;</l>
     <l n="340">The plenteous crops contained in each small field ;</l>
     <l n="341">The Summer evening 's song of “ Whip-poor-will , ”</l>
     <l n="342">Near , or remote , while all beside is still ;</l>
     <l n="343">The clamorous crow 's most harsh discordant note ;</l>
     <l n="344">The blue jay , prone to steal — by nature taught ;</l>
     <l n="345">The beauteous woodpecker — the pigeon 's flight ;</l>
     <l n="346">The snake , innoxious , gliding out of sight —</l>
     <l n="347">These sights and sounds brought pleasure to his mind ,</l>
     <l n="348">Most heart-felt pleasure , leaving peace behind .</l>
     <l n="349">And though he toiled with all the eagerness</l>
     <l n="350">Which youths Of ardent temperaments possess ,</l>
     <l n="351">Till his poor body every night was tired ,</l>
     <l n="352">He evermore these sounds and sights admired .</l>
     <l n="353">And naught but broken health could e'er have drove</l>
     <l n="354">Him from those woods , in which he loved to rove .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="355">Meanwhile , he took the first convenient time</l>
     <l n="356">To get some cherry logs , in soundness prime ,</l>
     <l n="357">From which rude bedsteads he contrived to make ,</l>
     <l n="358">That they their rest might with more comfort take .</l>
     <l n="359">He made a table , too , and felt quite glad</l>
     <l n="360">That they , at last so good a table had .</l>
     <l n="361">These things were spoken of not boastingly ,</l>
     <l n="362">But with a view to let new-comers see</l>
     <l n="363">How , in the Bush , strange shifts and turns are made ,</l>
     <l n="364">By those who , rightly , are of debt afraid .</l>
     <l n="365">The COOPERS , simple minded , could not brook</l>
     <l n="366">To stand as debtors in a tradesman 's book ;</l>
     <l n="367">And even to this day — through eighteen years —</l>
     <l n="368">‘ Twould grieve them sore should they be in arrears .</l>
     <l n="369">And I am sure it would be better far ,</l>
     <l n="370">That families should themselves from debt debar ,</l>
     <l n="371">Than blast their prospects , as too many do ,</l>
     <l n="372">By what they have so often cause to rue !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="373">From this digression let us now return ,</l>
     <l n="374">To note what WILLIAM found with deep concern ;</l>
     <l n="375">That “ ‘ Tis not good for Man to be alone , ”</l>
     <l n="376">As said by God , in Wisdom 's solemn tone .</l>
     <l n="377">This now appeared to him a serious truth ,</l>
     <l n="378">Far more than it had done in days of youth .</l>
     <l n="379">The birds still paired , and had their separate nest ,</l>
     <l n="380">From love responsive in each songster 's breast ;</l>
     <l n="381">But , though he loved on Nature 's face to gaze ,</l>
     <l n="382">And mark the beauties which each day displays ,</l>
     <l n="383">He felt a vacancy in his young breast ,</l>
     <l n="384">For he no lov 'd companion then possessed .</l>
     <l n="385">Far different was it in his native land —</l>
     <l n="386">There , such an one might always be at hand .</l>
     <l n="387">Where was he now to look ? Religious views</l>
     <l n="388">Left him small space from which a mate to choose .</l>
     <l n="389">God 's word came to his aid , and then in prayer</l>
     <l n="390">He threw himself upon his Father 's care .</l>
     <l n="391">That word declares , that “ He who had not spared</l>
     <l n="392">His well-beloved Son , was not prepared</l>
     <l n="393">For once withholding from his children dear</l>
     <l n="394">Aught which they need , while still sojourning here ! ”</l>
     <l n="395">This precious promise proved to be as balm ,</l>
     <l n="396">To keep his troubled heart at present calm ;</l>
     <l n="397">And he resolved in patience still to wait ,</l>
     <l n="398">Till God should find for him a true “ help-mate . ”</l>
     <l n="399">This resolution formed , was kept intact ,</l>
     <l n="400">Nor was the strength his own , for that he lacked .</l>
     <l n="401">He , though so young , had very clearly seen</l>
     <l n="402">That Man , in every age , is prone to lean</l>
     <l n="403">Upon an arm of flesh — most frail support !</l>
     <l n="404">Which often fails us , oft makes us its sport .</l>
     <l n="405">And yet , O strange perversity ! we cling</l>
     <l n="406">To that which never can us comfort bring .</l>
     <l n="407">He knew ‘ twas better to feel flesh so weak</l>
     <l n="408">As to be forced his strength from God to seek ;</l>
     <l n="409">To feel , like Paul , “ However weak we be ,</l>
     <l n="410">We may still glory in Infirmity . ”</l>
     <l n="411">From day to day , from week to week mav prove</l>
     <l n="412">The prcciousness of trusting in God 's love !</l>
     <l n="413">Should we do this , our joy will never cease —</l>
     <l n="414">Dark things will all look bright ! Our end be peace !</l>

     <l n="10">Hail , Rural Life ! from whom such pleasures spring ,</l>
     <l n="11">That I invoke my Muse thy charms to sing .</l>
     <l n="12">Whether I view thee in my native land ,</l>
     <l n="13">Where Science lends to Industry her hand ,</l>
     <l n="14">To make her cornfields yield a double store ,</l>
     <l n="15">Or beautify her landscapes more and more —</l>
     <l n="16">Where wealth immense is very freely spent ,</l>
     <l n="17">By those who on thy weal are still intent ;</l>
     <l n="18">Or here , in Canada , thy face I view</l>
     <l n="19">On well-cleared farms , or those which are quite new ;</l>
     <l n="20">However rude thy features , or despised —</l>
     <l n="21">Though in Town-life , thy charms by me are prized .</l>
     <l n="22">A sense of these still urges me along ,</l>
     <l n="23">As I proceed with my unlettered song ;</l>
     <l n="24">And every line which I may write on thee ,</l>
     <l n="25">I trust will evidence sincerity .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="26">The new-come settlers now with speed prepare</l>
     <l n="27">To log the fallow they have cleared with care .</l>
     <l n="28">For Summer , with her heat intense , has fled ,</l>
     <l n="29">And fruit-crowned Autumn has come in her stead .</l>
     <l n="30">The brush , well dried , is burnt ; and all around</l>
     <l n="31">Logs , black and charred , are lying on the ground .</l>
     <l n="32">These into heaps must every one be drawn ,</l>
     <l n="33">By means which to all Bush-men are well known .</l>
     <l n="34">Have they not strength or time the work to do ?</l>
     <l n="35">They ask their neighbor 's help , and oxen , too .</l>
     <l n="36">And fellow-feeling , sprung from their own need ,</l>
     <l n="37">Leads these the summons to obey with speed .</l>
     <l n="38">Should the set day be fine , they start from home</l>
     <l n="39">Without regret , and to the fallow come .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="40">One looks so pale , he seems not fit for work ;</l>
     <l n="41">Has had the Ague , and it still doth lurk</l>
     <l n="42">In his poor frame , and may again appear</l>
     <l n="43">A dozen times before he 's closed the year !</l>
     <l n="44">Some others , also , wear quite sickly looks ,</l>
     <l n="45">As though they had run deep in Doctors ’ books ;</l>
     <l n="46">Or are reduced , by heat and toil intense ,</l>
     <l n="47">Till work , with them , would seem , but mere pretence .</l>
     <l n="48">But let us not pre-judge them ; they have hearts</l>
     <l n="49">Brave as a lion , and will act their parts .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="50">The “ fixings ” ready , some experienced hand</l>
     <l n="51">A “ Come , boys ! Let 's to work ! ” gives as command .</l>
     <l n="52">This said , their strength and numbers they divide ;</l>
     <l n="53">“ Haw , Buck ! ” “ Gee , Bright ! ” is heard on every side .</l>
     <l n="54">“ Boys , bring your handspikes ; raise this monster log</l>
     <l n="55">Till I can hitch the chain — Buck ! lazy dog !</l>
     <l n="56">Stand o'er , I say ! What ails the stupid beast ?</l>
     <l n="57">Ah ! now I see ; you think you have a feast ! ”</l>
     <l n="58">Buck snatches at a clump of herbage near ,</l>
     <l n="59">And deems it is , to him , most savory cheer ;</l>
     <l n="60">But thwack , thwack , thwack , comes from the blue-beech goad ;</l>
     <l n="61">He takes the strokes upon his forehead broad</l>
     <l n="62">With due submission ; moves a little piece ,</l>
     <l n="63">That those unwelcome blows may sooner cease .</l>
     <l n="64">The chain is hitched ; “ Haw , now ! ” is loudly heard ,</l>
     <l n="65">And the half-buried log is disinterred .</l>
     <l n="66">“ Get up ! Go ‘ long ? ” vociferously shouts</l>
     <l n="67">Every ox-teamster , at these logging bouts .</l>
     <l n="68">The heap is reached ; now list the loud “ Whoa-ay ! ”</l>
     <l n="69">Louder and louder , till the oxen stay .</l>
     <l n="70">The chain 's unhitched ; “ Now , boys ! your handspikes seize ;</l>
     <l n="71">Lift ! Altogether ! Rest it on your knees ;</l>
     <l n="72">There ; roll him over . Ah ! ‘ twas nobly done !</l>
     <l n="73">The fire will dry his coat , as sure 's a gun ! ”</l>
     <l n="74">And thus , to lighten toil , they pass the joke ,</l>
     <l n="75">Or stand a moment to have serious talk .</l>
     <l n="76">One of some accidents his neighbors tells ,</l>
     <l n="77">Till each warm bosom with emotion swells ;</l>
     <l n="78">How Jack Maguin was logging at a “ Bee , ”</l>
     <l n="79">And got his right leg broke beneath the knee ;</l>
     <l n="80">How he , through careless treatment , was laid up</l>
     <l n="81">For full two months , and had scarce bite or sup .</l>
     <l n="82">Or how Will Sims was chopping near his house ,</l>
     <l n="83">And his best ox was feeding on the “ browse , ”</l>
     <l n="84">When all at once the quivering tree descended</l>
     <l n="85">Upon the beast , and thus his life was ended !</l>
     <l n="86">Anon we notice that each smutty face</l>
     <l n="87">Beams with good humor , and the cause we trace</l>
     <l n="88">To the supply of whisky just parta'en —</l>
     <l n="89">A thing which often proves the settler 's bane .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="90">Again they work with stimulated strength ,</l>
     <l n="91">And , ‘ midst more noise , the log-heaps rise at length .</l>
     <l n="92">The dinner hour arrives ; the horn is blown</l>
     <l n="93">To make the fact to all the loggers known .</l>
     <l n="94">The teams to some near pasture now are led ,</l>
     <l n="95">Or with new hay most plentifully fed .</l>
     <l n="96">The men make for the house with decent haste —</l>
     <l n="97">None are inclined to let time run to waste .</l>
     <l n="98">But this does not prevent the laugh and jest ,</l>
     <l n="99">At the black face by every one possessed .</l>
     <l n="100">To wash is needful , and refreshing , too ,</l>
     <l n="101">So all go at it without more ado .</l>
     <l n="102">This task performed , which all should take delight in ,</l>
     <l n="103">They to the feast prepared need no inviting .</l>
     <l n="104">Their heavy labor gives an appetite ,</l>
     <l n="105">And they can eat with relish and delight .</l>
     <l n="106">But first their host , if he 's a Christian man ,</l>
     <l n="107">Gives thanks to God with all the warmth he can .</l>
     <l n="108">Then all the workmen ample justice do</l>
     <l n="109">To those good things so tempting to the view .</l>
     <l n="110">Dear Reader , have you seen a logging feast ?</l>
     <l n="111">No ? Wait a while , and I will place at least</l>
     <l n="112">The chief ingredients before your eyes ;</l>
     <l n="113">Here 's a huge prime ham ; there are pumpkin pies ;</l>
     <l n="114">Mealy potatoes next our notice claim —</l>
     <l n="115">The bread and butter we need never name ,</l>
     <l n="116">They must be there of course ; and here 's a dish</l>
     <l n="117">Of no mean size , well filled with splendid fish .</l>
     <l n="118">That 's boiled , fresh mutton ; those are nice green peas ;</l>
     <l n="119">This huckleberry pie is sure to please !</l>
     <l n="120">And now I 'll cease — no , three things yet remain ;</l>
     <l n="121">Tea , cream and sugar , might of slight complain !</l>
     <l n="122">There , will this do ? Or is there something more</l>
     <l n="123">Which you would think it right to set before</l>
     <l n="124">Such worthy eaters ? I am satisfied</l>
     <l n="125">It can n't be bettered in our Bush-land wide !</l>
     <l n="126">Good as it is , and hungry as they are ,</l>
     <l n="127">They cannot from good jests themselves debar .</l>
     <l n="128">One sees his neighbor cast a longing glance</l>
     <l n="129">Toward that berry pie ; and , rare good chance !</l>
     <l n="130">‘ Tis nearest him , he chuckles with delight ,</l>
     <l n="131">And is about to whip it out of sight ;</l>
     <l n="132">But Fortune , still capricious , gives the No ;</l>
     <l n="133">His nearest neighbor does an interest show</l>
     <l n="134">In this proceeding , and the pie has snatched ,</l>
     <l n="135">Quite in good humor , ere the scheme 's well hatched !</l>
     <l n="136">The disappointed couple sympathise ,</l>
     <l n="137">And signal to each other , with their eyes .</l>
     <l n="138">The third one , quite unselfish , deems the jest</l>
     <l n="139">Gone far enough , and now resolves ‘ tis best</l>
     <l n="140">To help himself , and hand round to the rest .</l>
     <l n="141">Another to the fishes takes a notion ,</l>
     <l n="142">With more of selfishness than wise precaution .</l>
     <l n="143">His work-mate spies this , and removes the prize</l>
     <l n="144">A leetle further from his longing eyes .</l>
     <l n="145">Such jokes pass free ; and no great wrong is done</l>
     <l n="146">To real good-fellowship by harmless fun .</l>
     <l n="147">‘ Tis o'er at last , when most of them partake</l>
     <l n="148">The pipe delicious , for its own dear sake .</l>
     <l n="149">They rest and smoke , and smoke and rest again ,</l>
     <l n="150">Until the “ Come , boys ! ” sounds in loudest strain .</l>
     <l n="151">Once more to work , with fresh alacrity ,</l>
     <l n="152">They reach the fallow , pleased as men can be .</l>
     <l n="153">The teamsters call their cattle , not far strayed ,</l>
     <l n="154">But chewing cud beneath some green tree 's shade .</l>
     <l n="155">“ Co ’ Buck ! Co ’ Bright ! ” throughout the woods resound ,</l>
     <l n="156">And each trained ox moves forward at the sound .</l>
     <l n="157">Again the work goes forward , as before .</l>
     <l n="158">Till nearly night-fall , when their task is o'er .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="159">Naught now remains but scattered chips and sticks ,</l>
     <l n="160">Which their host 's hopeful son at leisure picks ,</l>
     <l n="161">And lays upon the heaps — some here , some there —</l>
     <l n="162">The burning to assist , which needs due care .</l>
     <l n="163">‘ Tis supper time ; again the horn is heard ,</l>
     <l n="164">And its deep tones has woodland echoes stirred .</l>
     <l n="165">Most charming sound to my poetic ear ;</l>
     <l n="166">And every time ‘ tis heard still far more dear !</l>
     <l n="167">They hear the sound , but yet seem loath to go ;</l>
     <l n="168">And when they do , their steps are very slow .</l>
     <l n="169">They are well tired ; no wonder ; such a day</l>
     <l n="170">Of work laborious would some tire for aye !</l>
     <l n="171">Once more they wash ; once more they freely eat ;</l>
     <l n="172">Then light their pipes ; and now each other greet</l>
     <l n="173">With warm “ Good night ! ” but , ere they have departed ,</l>
     <l n="174">Their host thanks them , from gratitude warm-hearted .</l>
     <l n="175">Now all are gone , save two , who skulk behind ,</l>
     <l n="176">Of the younger son ; and , if I am not blind ,</l>
     <l n="177">A couple of bright girls I failed to mention ,</l>
     <l n="178">Are not quite unaware of their intention .</l>
     <l n="179">But this is not my business , so I 'll pass</l>
     <l n="180">To other things , and let each court his lass .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="181">Should next day prove a fine one with a breeze</l>
     <l n="182">So strong as just to move surrounding trees ,</l>
     <l n="183">The Settler may his new-raised log-heaps fire ,</l>
     <l n="184">And see them burn to suit his heart 's desire .</l>
     <l n="185">The fire is placed ; where , think you ? Not below ,</l>
     <l n="186">But on the top , and burns at first but slow .</l>
     <l n="187">See , now , the wind has blown it to a flame ;</l>
     <l n="188">And soon the log-heap fire 's no longer tame !</l>
     <l n="189">Dry sticks and chips , in all the openings placed ,</l>

     <l n="193">With pale or ruddy flame ; the smoke ascends</l>
     <l n="194">Thick , black and curling , as its way it wends</l>
     <l n="195">Toward the sky . Now twenty heaps are fired</l>
     <l n="196">And form a sight I often have admired .</l>

     <l n="198">Uniting with the wood-fire 's fiercest blaze ,</l>
     <l n="199">Make it past bearing ; yet the Settler bears</l>
     <l n="200">The heat and toil , and smiling aspect wears ,</l>
     <l n="201">Because the work progresses to his mind .</l>
     <l n="202">Let us draw nearer , then — ‘ twill seem more kind —</l>
     <l n="203">And watch him with the handspike thrust the brands</l>
     <l n="204">Closer together . He a moment stands</l>
     <l n="205">To wipe the perspiration from his face ,</l>
     <l n="206">Which streams fast forth again , and leaves its trace</l>
     <l n="207">In his pale looks and daily shrinking frame .</l>
     <l n="208">Now , every pile 's a mass of glowing flame !</l>
     <l n="209">The wind , increasing , whirls the fire about ,</l>
     <l n="210">And makes the workman , if he 's wise , look out</l>
     <l n="211">For stacks and fences — dangerously near .</l>
     <l n="212">He knows the risk ; he deems there 's cause for fear ;</l>
     <l n="213">So keeps his eyes still wandering all around ,</l>
     <l n="214">To mark the rising smoke where'er ‘ tis found .</l>
     <l n="215">Neglect might very soon cause damage great ,</l>
     <l n="216">In that which should , his labor compensate .</l>
     <l n="217">Hence his wise caution as the wind grows stronger ,</l>
     <l n="218">Until the “ burning ” needs his care no longer .</l>
     <l n="219">This o'er he drags the ground , and sows his grain ,</l>
     <l n="220">And of the toil required does not complain .</l>
     <l n="221">He “ sows in hope ; ” and , if he take due care ,</l>
     <l n="222">A splendid crop sill soon be growing there .</l>
     <l n="223">In view of this , let us suppose him singing</l>
     <l n="224">The LOGGER 'S SONG , while peaceful thoughts are springing .</l>

     <l n="1">Come , Boys , to the Logging be cheerfully jogging ,</l>

     <l n="13">The logs , thickly lying , our strength seem defying ;</l>

     <l n="15">With hand-spikes unbending , this day we will spend in</l>
     <l n="16">The capture of each charred foe .</l>

     <l n="37">Such work as that I have described above ,</l>
     <l n="38">And holding plow , kept WILLIAM on the move .</l>
     <l n="39">Of active turn , he worked beyond his strength —</l>
     <l n="40">And felt the sad effects , in full , at length .</l>
     <l n="41">Yet at this season , in Canadian woods ,</l>
     <l n="42">He could not well refrain from musing moods .</l>
     <l n="43">Nor was it any wonder , when each day</l>
     <l n="44">Added fresh charms to Nature 's grand display .</l>
     <l n="45">The once-green leaves , struck by the early frost ,</l>
     <l n="46">Made up in gorgeous tints what they had lost !</l>
     <l n="47">He felt that never in his life before</l>
     <l n="48">Had he e'er seen such hues as those trees wore .</l>
     <l n="49">Some that were shaded still preserved their green ,</l>
     <l n="50">While others near were decked in golden sheen .</l>
     <l n="51">Some in deep crimson robes were gaily drest ,</l>
     <l n="52">Others in shades of brown , as seemed them best ;</l>
     <l n="53">While not a few , of pride in dress were fuller ,</l>
     <l n="54">And had their robes of every splendid color !</l>
     <l n="55">The weather , too , was of that balmy kind ,</l>
     <l n="56">So suited to a dreamy state of mind ;</l>
     <l n="57">For mighty Sol felt his yet powerful rays</l>
     <l n="58">Subdued , being wrapped in a thin , blue haze .</l>
     <l n="59">‘ Tis true , there came the oft-recurring thought ,</l>
     <l n="60">That all these beauties were too dearly bought ;</l>
     <l n="61">That soon , too soon , tempestuous winds would rise ,</l>
     <l n="62">And murky clouds veil those bewitching skies !</l>
     <l n="63">That Winter but delayed his coming now</l>
     <l n="64">To gather blackness on his cold , knit brow ,</l>
     <l n="65">That he might rush with tenfold furious rage ,</l>
     <l n="66">And all the elements in war engage ,</l>
     <l n="67">To strip the trees of all their splendors bare</l>
     <l n="68">And make sweet Nature a stern aspect wear !</l>
     <l n="69">Such thoughts at times filled him with melancholy ,</l>
     <l n="70">Which then , shook off , were looked upon as folly</l>
     <l n="71">And after-thoughts brought in their joyous train</l>
     <l n="72">Pleasures prospective , during Winter 's reign .</l>
     <l n="73">The fleecy snow 's wild dancing through the air ;</l>
     <l n="74">The clean , white sheet , wove for the soil to wear ,</l>
     <l n="75">To guard the plants designed for next year 's food</l>
     <l n="76">From Frost 's attacks , when in a vengeful mood .</l>
     <l n="77">The sleighing , too , in prospect , had delights</l>
     <l n="78">For one like he — so used to Fancy 's flights .</l>
     <l n="79">He heard already , in imagination ,</l>
     <l n="80">The jingling bells , producing sweet sensation .</l>
     <l n="81">And ‘ midst such dreaming Time flew swiftly by ,</l>
     <l n="82">While he , to stay its course , wished not to try .</l>
     <l n="83">His Sabbath days met with observance due ,</l>
     <l n="84">For he to Christian ways continued true .</l>
     <l n="85">The family with loving Brethren met ,</l>
     <l n="86">Some miles from home , as oft as they could get .</l>
     <l n="87">With them “ broke bread , ” and joined in praise and prayer ,</l>
     <l n="88">Or heard Christ 's doctrine read , or preached , with care .</l>
     <l n="89">This they continued every Sabbath day ,</l>
     <l n="90">And found much benefit from it always .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="91">Meanwhile their worldly means grew less and less ,</l>
     <l n="92">And fear of debt led them through some distress .</l>
     <l n="93">At last their circumstances were made known</l>
     <l n="94">To a dear friend , who did a kind heart own .</l>
     <l n="95">He WILLIAM took , to help him in his store ,</l>
     <l n="96">And gave good wages — which endeared him more</l>
     <l n="97">To those , thus favored , who by this perceived</l>
     <l n="98">He carried out , in practice , truths believed .</l>
     <l n="99">In this employment WILLIAM staid not long ,</l>
     <l n="100">His sensitiveness soon made things go wrong .</l>
     <l n="101">He therefore back returned into the Bush ,</l>
     <l n="102">Where Want stood ready his fond hopes to crush .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="103">Ere this , dread Winter had set in with rigor ,</l>
     <l n="104">Yet he his bright axe took again with vigor .</l>
     <l n="105">Throughout the woods the snow lay very deep ,</l>
     <l n="106">And Nature 's face betokened death-like sleep .</l>
     <l n="107">Few sounds were heard to break the stillness round ,</l>
     <l n="108">Yet in those few our hero pleasure found .</l>
     <l n="109">The loud report of Indian hunter 's gun ,</l>
     <l n="110">Which sometimes made the cattle homeward run ;</l>
     <l n="111">The beauteous woodpecker 's quick rap-tapping</l>
     <l n="112">At girdled trees , that long since had no sap in ;</l>
     <l n="113">Besides , the chopper 's almost constant stroke</l>
     <l n="114">Rang through pure air , and louder echoes woke ;</l>
     <l n="115">While ever and anon a tree would fall</l>
     <l n="116">With thundering crash , which might some minds appal .</l>
     <l n="117">These all were sounds which he loved well to hear ,</l>
     <l n="118">For they , ‘ mid hard employ , his heart did cheer .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="119">Severe the Bush-man 's life , and full of danger ,</l>
     <l n="120">While , to most scanty fare he is no stranger .</l>
     <l n="121">It needs good eyes , strong arms , and courage , too ,</l>
     <l n="122">To live the life which most new settlers do .</l>
     <l n="123">The elder COOPER 'S sight was very bad ,</l>
     <l n="124">Which came nigh bringing him a fate most sad .</l>
     <l n="125">They were both chopping at a basswood tree —</l>
     <l n="126">Stroke followed after stroke most rapidly —</l>
     <l n="127">When , lo ! a sudden blast of wind arose ,</l>
     <l n="128">WILLIAM perceived it , and withheld his blows ;</l>
     <l n="129">Looked up , saw danger , bade his father fly !</l>
     <l n="130">Reached a safe place himself , which was near by ;</l>
     <l n="131">The tree came down ; he quickly then returned ,</l>
     <l n="132">And stood amazed as soon as he discerned</l>
     <l n="133">His father 's near escape from tree-crushed fate ;</l>
     <l n="134">He quite unconscious of his danger great .</l>
     <l n="135">There rested , just a foot above his head ,</l>
     <l n="136">A huge crook 'd branch , that might have struck him dead ,</l>
     <l n="137">Had it not been for God 's most watchful care ,</l>
     <l n="138">So plainly manifested to him there .</l>
     <l n="139">This wondrous mercy called forth gratitude ,</l>
     <l n="140">And Love 's warm glow fresh in their hearts renewed .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="141">In cutting logs for barn , and drawing lumber ,</l>
     <l n="142">Our hero spent of days a goodly number .</l>
     <l n="143">Amongst deep snow , and with a slow ox-team ,</l>
     <l n="144">One thinks ‘ twould prove a damper to his dream .</l>
     <l n="145">Not so , however ; though his food was scant ,</l>
     <l n="146">Of liking for the Bush he felt no want .</l>
     <l n="147">He and his brother scoured the woods around ,</l>
     <l n="148">Where'er ‘ twas likely straight logs could be found .</l>
     <l n="149">These cut , were left till snow had “ settled down , ”</l>
     <l n="150">When to the barn-site they with speed were drawn .</l>
     <l n="151">Thus passed the hardest months of that hard season ,</l>
     <l n="152">And Sol 's increasing warmth was hailed with reason .</l>
     <l n="153">The more , because that Sugar-time drew near ,</l>
     <l n="154">With its romantic scenes , to WILLIAM dear</l>
     <l n="155">From what he heard the older Settlers say ,</l>
     <l n="156">So , for it he prepared without delay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="157">South of their home there grew a splendid lot</l>
     <l n="158">Of noble maples , in a sheltered spot .</l>
     <l n="159">Convenient to this place , there also grew</l>
     <l n="160">Some good black-ash , of which he chose a few</l>
     <l n="161">From these he made small troughs to catch the sap ,</l>
     <l n="162">Whene'er the time should come the trees to tap .</l>
     <l n="163">A good pine tree he sought , with eager eyes ,</l>
     <l n="164">To form a store-trough , of most ample size .</l>
     <l n="165">Obtained a gouge , and next his spiles prepared ;</l>
     <l n="166">For all the toil required he little cared .</l>
     <l n="167">“ Good axe-men fifty small troughs make per day ; ”</l>
     <l n="168">So said old Woods-men , in a boasting way .</l>
     <l n="169">This roused ambition in his youthful breast ,</l>
     <l n="170">And he worked hard , scarce taking time for rest .</l>
     <l n="171">His pride was somewhat humbled when he found</l>
     <l n="172">That he could make but thirty each day round .</l>
     <l n="173">Yet courage took from this , that their 's were made</l>
     <l n="174">Of soft pine wood , which did their smartness aid .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="175">‘ Tis March , and now the snow has settled down</l>
     <l n="176">To half its former depth ; Sol 's beams have grown</l>
     <l n="177">Sufficiently direct to make clear days</l>
     <l n="178">Feel warm enough to raise the sap , which plays</l>
     <l n="179">With life-renewing power , through all the trees ;</l>
     <l n="180">And yet , at night , ‘ tis cold enough to freeze .</l>
     <l n="181">The Sugarer knows no time must now be lost</l>
     <l n="182">To be successful ; so he takes his post</l>
     <l n="183">About the centre of the “ Sugar-Bush , ”</l>
     <l n="184">Whence he his labors can most freely push .</l>
     <l n="185">If wise , in lieu of gash he bores a hole</l>
     <l n="186">With auger , at right height , in each tree 's bole ;</l>
     <l n="187">Drives in his gouge a-slant , inserts his spile ,</l>
     <l n="188">Places a trough — fast lessening thus his pile .</l>
     <l n="189">At first , perhaps , the sap will scarcely flow ;</l>
     <l n="190">He heeds this not , but onward still doth go ,</l>
     <l n="191">Till every tree that he intends to tap</l>
     <l n="192">Is quite prepared to yield its share of sap .</l>
     <l n="193">This done , without delay he now will fix</l>
     <l n="194">His boiling place , and get two strong , forked sticks ;</l>
     <l n="195">These , well secured , with pole to reach across ,</l>
     <l n="196">For hanging kettles he is at no loss .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="197">By this time , if the day continue warm ,</l>

     <l n="200">And he , to gather sap , begins in haste .</l>
     <l n="201">With pail upon each arm he moves along ,</l>
     <l n="202">O'er the soft snow , the noble trees among .</l>
     <l n="203">If tunable , perhaps a song he sings</l>
     <l n="204">Of “ Auld lang syne , ” or some more serious things ,</l>
     <l n="205">Which tends to make his work more easy seem ,</l>
     <l n="206">Or drive away some foolish , waking dream .</l>
     <l n="207">The Bush , if large , will need another band</l>
     <l n="208">To tend the fire ; and this one must command</l>
     <l n="209">Sufficient knowledge of the Sugaring feat</l>
     <l n="210">To guard the syrup from too great a heat .</l>
     <l n="211">He must mind , too , to fill the boilers up ;</l>
     <l n="212">And if he choose , he may ev'n take a sup</l>
     <l n="213">Of maple-honey , whose delicious flavor</l>
     <l n="214">More than repays their outlay and hard labor .</l>
     <l n="215">It now has reached that point when constant watch</l>
     <l n="216">Must be kept o'er it , lest they spoil the batch .</l>
     <l n="217">New milk , or eggs , are used to clarify</l>
     <l n="218">The saccharine juice , that it may truly vie</l>
     <l n="219">For purity , with any sugar made ,</l>
     <l n="220">By those who have been brought up to the trade .</l>
     <l n="221">‘ Tis read now for straining ; and as Eve</l>
     <l n="222">Draws her dark curtains , we the Bush may leave ,</l>
     <l n="223">And follow him who bears his precious load ,</l>
     <l n="224">Well pleased , but tired , to his rude log abode .</l>
     <l n="225">Let 's enter , unperceived , that we may see</l>
     <l n="226">The Sugar take its next and last degree .</l>
     <l n="227">Through flannel bag the syrup now they strain ,</l>
     <l n="228">And the close texture does the dregs retain .</l>
     <l n="229">Now it is placed o'er quite a gentle fire ,</l>
     <l n="230">Till it assume that state which they require .</l>
     <l n="231">This , b repeated trial , they discover ;</l>
     <l n="232">When cool , it will “ grain ” well , and boiling 's over .</l>
     <l n="233">I 've now gone through this sugar-making process</l>
     <l n="234">In business form ; not giving , more or less ,</l>
     <l n="235">A hint of frolics which the young folks play ,</l>
     <l n="236">In sugaring-time , and after close of day .</l>
     <l n="237">My readers may imagine , if they choose ,</l>
     <l n="238">The fun that from such gatherings ensues ;</l>
     <l n="239">While I proceed to frame a harmless Song ,</l>
     <l n="240">Expressive of the Sugarer 's feelings strong ,</l>
     <l n="241">As he his most delightful work pursued ,</l>
     <l n="242">Midst leafless trees , in deepest solitude .</l>

     <l n="22">Go where I may , thou ever art with me ,</l>
     <l n="23">As Counsellor and Friend , dear Memory !</l>
     <l n="24">Thy secret depths I would again explore ,</l>

     <l n="29">Which COOPER passed through with such slender means ,</l>
     <l n="30">‘ Tis early Spring-time , and the opening buds</l>
     <l n="31">Bestud the boughs of trees through all the woods .</l>
     <l n="32">The snow and frost remain till rather late ;</l>
     <l n="33">But Sol 's great power for this will compensate .</l>
     <l n="34">He , aided by soft winds and copious rain ,</l>
     <l n="35">Will melt the snow , and break stern Winter 's chain .</l>
     <l n="36">The Frost-King , thus so suddenly dethroned ,</l>
     <l n="37">May vent his rage , as if a giant groaned ;</l>
     <l n="38">Or muster scattered forces and come back</l>
     <l n="39">Once and again , to the repulsed attack !</l>
     <l n="40">And when he finds his efforts all in vain ,</l>
     <l n="41">May hurl defiance on Spring 's beauteous train ;</l>
     <l n="42">And , from his region of eternal snow ,</l>
     <l n="43">Send rude North winds to strike a deadly blow ;</l>
     <l n="44">To nip the fairest blossoms in the bud ,</l>
     <l n="45">And blast , in spite , the gardener 's prospects good .</l>
     <l n="46">Yet One , Almighty , will his rage control ;</l>
     <l n="47">His fiat has gone forth , “ Let Seasons roll</l>
     <l n="48">In quick succession , while the Earth endures ! ”</l>

     <l n="54">On every hand the brightly green-robed trees</l>

     <l n="72">Up to this time our Emigrants contrived</l>
     <l n="73">To keep from debt , though they themselves deprived</l>
     <l n="74">Far , far too often , of substantial food —</l>
     <l n="75">Which , in the end , did them but little good .</l>

     <l n="101">Sometimes a Settler viewed him with suspicion ,</l>

     <l n="55">The engine 's whistle warns him now to go ,</l>

     <l n="1">Hail , Hope ! thou gem-decked Maid , with features fair !</l>
     <l n="2">Fairer than fabled goddesses of air .</l>
     <l n="3">I still regarded thee as sprung from God ;</l>
     <l n="4">As sent to us from his divine abode ,</l>
     <l n="5">With the sweet sisters , holy Faith and Love ,</l>
     <l n="6">That favored mortals might your virtues prove .</l>
     <l n="7">Led on by thee , we pass through heavy trial ,</l>
     <l n="8">Requiring ever constant self-denial ,</l>
     <l n="9">Unscathed , yet ridded of defiling dross ,</l>
     <l n="10">To find ourselves the better for its loss .</l>
     <l n="11">Prompted by thee , we scale vast mountain heights ;</l>
     <l n="12">Or take to Earth 's far bounds most rapid flights ;</l>
     <l n="13">Face dreadful storms ; yea , greatest dangers brave ,</l>
     <l n="14">And , unappalled , view the deep , yawning grave !</l>
     <l n="15">In every age thy praise have Poets sung ;</l>
     <l n="16">Throughout the world thy praise has loudly rung</l>
     <l n="17">So much and often , that I need not dwell</l>
     <l n="18">Upon thy worth : for it were hard to tell</l>
     <l n="19">The millionth part of good thou hast achieved ;</l>
     <l n="20">By finite man it cannot be conceived !</l>
     <l n="21">Thy sovereign virtues WILLIAM deeply felt ,</l>
     <l n="22">Howe'er engaged , and wheresoe'er he dwelt .</l>
     <l n="23">In constant toil , and chilled by Penury ,</l>
     <l n="24">He knew ‘ twas blessed to be cheered by thee .</l>
     <l n="25">Thou madest him content in low estate ,</l>
     <l n="26">And for Prosperity to patient wait ;</l>
     <l n="27">Till some , who thought his course deserved much blame ,</l>
     <l n="28">Were led to full approval of the same .</l>

     <l n="29">More weeks went past , and his kind patron bought</l>
     <l n="30">Both tools and stock ; when he with vigor wrought</l>
     <l n="31">In a small shop , and did his best to give</l>
     <l n="32">Due satisfaction , and made out to live .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="33">Throughout the country nothing now was heard</l>

     <l n="36">From his employment ; and kept gaining ground .</l>
     <l n="37">The village of brave Soldier 's was quite full ,</l>
     <l n="38">And they , alone , made business far from dull .</l>
     <l n="39">When he at first commended , he made a rule</l>
     <l n="40">For which some folks then deemed him quite a fool</l>
     <l n="41">To make good work and cheap , and have his pay</l>
     <l n="42">For all he sold ; and this he did always .</l>
     <l n="43">He had been taught to look Honesty</l>
     <l n="44">As the best part of Business policy ;</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="47">Meanwhile , as worldly prospects brighter grew ,</l>
     <l n="48">To marriage state he turned his thoughts anew ,</l>
     <l n="49">And made proposals for that lovely maid ;</l>
     <l n="50">Nor was disapprobation once displayed</l>
     <l n="51">By either parent , who gave full consent ,</l>
     <l n="52">As she , to marry him , was quite content .</l>
     <l n="53">Though not a “ first love , ” their 's remained still true ,</l>
     <l n="54">And smoothly ran-was ever fresh and new !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="55">His humble home , and shop , were all in one ,</l>
     <l n="56">And looked , to others ’ eyes , most woe-begone !</l>
     <l n="57">It was for business truly quite unfit ;</l>
     <l n="58">Yet customers still found their way to it .</l>
     <l n="59">Back from the street — up some half dozen stairs —</l>
     <l n="60">Two boards , on barrels , held his shining wares !</l>
     <l n="61">On one side high — the other very low —</l>
     <l n="62">And all unplastered ; it was quite a show !</l>
     <l n="63">At one end stood his bench , and close beside it</l>
     <l n="64">Lay his rude couch ; let not the rich deride it !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="65">At times , he rose from off that humble bed</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="67">One bitter night , some loyal Volunteers</l>
     <l n="68">Were quartered on him ; and he told his fears ,</l>
     <l n="69">That much of comfort could not there be found ,</l>
     <l n="70">In such a room , with all his fixtures round .</l>
     <l n="71">One made reply which went to WILLIAM 'S heart ,</l>
     <l n="72">And proved that man had “ chosen the good part ” —</l>
     <l n="73">“ ‘ Tis better , ” said he , “ than our Savior had ;</l>
     <l n="74">Of such a lodging He would have been glad ! ”</l>

     <l n="75">Our hero , with his hand-tools got along ,</l>
     <l n="76">At best , but slowly ; and sometimes went wrong .</l>
     <l n="77">It was no easy thing to ascertain</l>
     <l n="78">What kind of goods a ready sale would gain .</l>
     <l n="79">His brother Tinsmith showed no friendly spirit ;</l>
     <l n="80">He deemed him far too low in workman-merit !</l>
     <l n="81">And threatened vauntingly to drive him out :</l>
     <l n="82">But God 's rich blessing compassed him about !</l>
     <l n="83">His patterns he contrived , as best he could ;</l>
     <l n="84">And every month , as tradesman , firmer stood .</l>
     <l n="85">His constant visits to his future bride ,</l>
     <l n="86">Much of sweet pleasure every time supplied .</l>
     <l n="87">Rare worth and beauty did the maid possess ;</l>
     <l n="88">To see her was to taste of happiness !</l>
     <l n="89">She was too lovely , and too gentle , far ,</l>
     <l n="90">For one whose mind was very oft ajar ;</l>
     <l n="91">So humble , that she left her father 's house ,</l>
     <l n="92">With all its comforts , to become his spouse .</l>
     <l n="93">The home which he for that fair girl provided ,</l>
     <l n="94">By most young lasses would have been derided .</l>
     <l n="95">‘ Twas just the farthest half of his rude shop ,</l>
     <l n="96">Lined with planed boards on all sides , and the top ;</l>
     <l n="97">Quite small in size , ‘ twas amply furnished ,</l>
     <l n="98">With stove , three chairs , a table , box and bed !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="99">In March , his natal month , through sleet and rain ,</l>
     <l n="100">He bore his wife , who did not once complain .</l>
     <l n="101">No wedding jaunt could their small means afford ,</l>
     <l n="102">Yet they had pleasure in true love 's accord ; ’</l>
     <l n="103">And what they lacked in way of outward show ,</l>
     <l n="104">Was quite made up by warm affection 's glow .</l>
     <l n="105">They were a happy couple , with warm hearts :</l>
     <l n="106">Both striving eagerly to act their parts .</l>
     <l n="107">If ever twain were blended into one ,</l>
     <l n="108">‘ Twas in their case , as all who knew them own .</l>
     <l n="109">He , working soon and late to rid his debt ;</l>
     <l n="110">She taking care of all he chanced to get .</l>
     <l n="111">And , with sweet smiles upon her face ,</l>
     <l n="112">Dispelling of despondency each trace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="113">Too soon , the place in which their bliss begun .</l>
     <l n="114">Was made too hot by our Canadian sun .</l>
     <l n="115">A Bakery below , Sol 's rays above ,</l>
     <l n="116">With heat from stove made them most glad to move .</l>
     <l n="117">They next obtained a shop which answered well ;</l>
     <l n="118">For all he made , they could most freely sell .</l>
     <l n="119">This place , however , they were forced to quit</l>
     <l n="120">In three months after they had entered it .</l>
     <l n="121">More than one person had on it a claim ,</l>
     <l n="122">And each law-suit fanned their litigious flame ,</l>
     <l n="123">Until at length it went to Chancery ,</l>
     <l n="124">And that sage Court could on this thing agree —</l>
     <l n="125">To have it closed forthwith ! And thus our friends</l>
     <l n="126">Were forced to move , once more , to gain their ends .</l>
     <l n="127">Each move brought double rent ; but this became</l>
     <l n="128">A thing remembered only by its name .</l>
     <l n="129">Trade still increased , as did Experience , too ,</l>
     <l n="130">And WILLIAM now had more than he could do .</l>
     <l n="131">But by this time he had assistance found</l>
     <l n="132">In his wife 's brother , as apprentice bound ;</l>
     <l n="133">A youth most active , and good-natured , too ,</l>
     <l n="134">Who took delight in what he had to do .</l>
     <l n="135">The shop to which they went — last on the street —</l>
     <l n="136">Was , as a residence , to them most sweet .</l>
     <l n="137">Almost in front , a river calmly flowed ;</l>
     <l n="138">Close by , a plain wood bridge the stream bestrode .</l>
     <l n="139">There , he could stand at his shop door and view</l>
     <l n="140">A scene which called up feelings ever new .</l>
     <l n="141">Above the bridge , for nearly half a mile ,</l>
     <l n="142">It is most lovely , clad in Summer 's smile .</l>
     <l n="143">Tall trees , of various kinds , its margins grace ,</l>
     <l n="144">While it flows on , with ever gentle pace ,</l>
     <l n="145">Past two small islands ; each one like a gem</l>
     <l n="146">Set in the stream so softly passing them .</l>
     <l n="147">There , often has he sat , on summer 's eve ,</l>
     <l n="148">With his fair bride , both loath the scene to leave .</l>
     <l n="149">Lit up by Luna 's beams , ‘ twould larger seem ,</l>
     <l n="150">And scope afford for sweet poetic dream .</l>
     <l n="151">One island he would picture as the site</l>
     <l n="152">Of a neat mansion , where he might , at night ,</l>
     <l n="153">Retire from business cares to take a boat .</l>
     <l n="154">And on the surface of the river float</l>
     <l n="155">With his most charming — his most loving wife ;</l>
     <l n="156">Content to leave behind all worldly strife .</l>
     <l n="157">Such freaks would Fancy play , when he inclined</l>
     <l n="158">To let her reign sole Monarch of his mind !</l>
     <l n="159">Yet , when the spell was broke , the sweets of home</l>
     <l n="160">Were such , that from them he ne'er wished to roam .</l>
     <l n="161">And thus days , weeks and months most smoothly passed ,</l>
     <l n="162">Till Winter came , each beauteous scene to blast .</l>
     <l n="163">Now , with new hopes , alas ! came fears as well ,</l>
     <l n="164">The strength of which it is not mine to tell .</l>
     <l n="165">But those who once have fond , young husbands been ,</l>
     <l n="166">May well conceive what hopes and fears I mean .</l>
     <l n="167">Scarce bad December sealed the Frost-King 's reign ,</l>

     <l n="172">And , oh , his visits there were truly sweet !</l>
     <l n="173">Nor was it vain ; two precious lives were spared ,</l>

     <l n="175">To grapple with their duties — growing large —</l>
     <l n="176">Conscious of weakness in their full discharge .</l>
     <l n="177">The babe proved cross and fretful ; and , for years ,</l>

     <l n="181">This proved an exercise for faith and prayer ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="187">A growing interest now in Church affairs</l>

     <l n="4">Yet I would first dry up my weeping eyes .</l>
     <l n="5">My full charged bosom heaves , and oh , how slow</l>
     <l n="6">Conflicting thoughts in well timed numbers flow .</l>
     <l n="7">Cease , rebel feelings , cease your dreadful strife ;</l>
     <l n="8">The theme 's my love , the partner of my life .</l>

     <l n="10">Upon her features playing , shows no guile .</l>

     <l n="12">The artist 's skill did our joint forms portray ?</l>
     <l n="13">Thou wast not then so foolish as to deem</l>
     <l n="14">An early death a vain or idle dream .</l>
     <l n="15">We oft had converse on that mournful theme ,</l>
     <l n="16">As oft looked forward to the solemn day</l>
     <l n="17">When death , grim monster ! should tear one away .</l>
     <l n="18">I thought my time most surely first would come ,</l>
     <l n="19">And thou , expected'st , first to reach thy home !</l>
     <l n="20">Thus were we apt to number out our days ,</l>
     <l n="21">And oft together led to seek God 's ways .</l>
     <l n="22">Most unfeigned pleasure did we take in this ,</l>
     <l n="23">And gained as fruit sweet tastes of heavenly bliss .</l>
     <l n="24">Now , my belov 'd one , thou art gone from me</l>
     <l n="25">And our dear little ones ! Oh ! can it be ?</l>
     <l n="26">The sad reality comes o'er my mind .</l>
     <l n="27">Thou'rt gone indeed , and we are left behind .</l>
     <l n="28">Oh for that faith of which thou wast possessed ,</l>
     <l n="29">As thy pure spirit strove to gain her rest .</l>
     <l n="30">Oh for that patience which thou didst display</l>
     <l n="31">Beneath our Father 's hand to thy last day .</l>
     <l n="32">Methinks that thou art whispering in my ear :</l>
     <l n="33">“ Let God 's sure promises thy spirit cheer ;</l>
     <l n="34">“ Remember that our Jesus is the same</l>
     <l n="35">“ To all whose trust is in His precious name .</l>
     <l n="36">“ A few short days , perchance , or months , or years ,</l>

     <l n="45">“ Let Hope , ‘ an anchor sure , ’ to thee belong .</l>
     <l n="46">“ The time 's not distant we again shall meet</l>
     <l n="47">“ To part no more . This is a thought most sweet .</l>
     <l n="48">“ But yet in patience do thy soul possess ,</l>
     <l n="49">“ And wait God 's time , and then He will thee bless . ”</l>
     <l n="50">Enough my loved one , I will haste away</l>
     <l n="51">To do my duties without more delay .</l>
     <l n="52">And trust in God who can fresh strength impart</l>

     <l n="54">Here , then , kind reader , I must close my lay ,</l>

     <l n="57">My lengthened tale , I bid you warm adieu .</l>

     <l n="2">Hail , truly pleasant , fast increasing Town !</l>
     <l n="3">Thee I address , in rude but earnest strains .</l>
     <l n="4">My own adopted place ! Some sixteen years</l>
     <l n="5">Have rolled fast o'er my head since first my eyes</l>
     <l n="6">Got sight of thee , from off yon Eastern hill .</l>
     <l n="7">How welcome was the sight ! O , how cheering ,</l>
     <l n="8">Grand and beautiful , to a mind like mine !</l>
     <l n="9">I oft had heard of thee before I came —</l>
     <l n="10">Had heard the name thy beauteous river bears ;</l>
     <l n="11">As oft had wondered if I e'er should live</l>
     <l n="12">To cross the broad Atlantic 's deep blue waves ,</l>
     <l n="13">And reach the shores of that vast Continent ,</l>
     <l n="14">Whose many wonders , in my boyish days ,</l>
     <l n="15">I tried to sing , and still longed much to see .</l>

     <l n="17">The appearance thou presented to the view ;</l>
     <l n="18">I fancied thee much less than what thou wert —</l>
     <l n="19">Consisting of a few small , straggling huts ,</l>
     <l n="20">Both rude in shape , and ruder far in things</l>
     <l n="21">Which make home , what it always ought to be ,</l>
     <l n="22">The dearest place that men possess on earth !</l>
     <l n="23">I next would paint thy river deep and broad</l>

     <l n="25">That everywhere abound throughout this land !</l>

    <note>Perhaps my readers will have the goodness to pardon me if I here present them with an exact copy of a Rhyming Letter which I received in answer to the poem above from my much respected and greatly lamented friend , the late Dr. Laycock , of Woodstock , Ont . I place it here because of the compliment he was kind enough to pay me on my rhyming abilities , and chiefly in relation to those Pieces to my Children . I candidly acknowledge that it was his opinion , so freely and perhaps flatteringly expressed , which weighed with me greatly as an inducement for giving so many of them in these pages .</note>

     <l n="4">Before him prospects which might well appal</l>

     <l n="11">Make him quite loth to leave his much loved home .</l>
     <l n="12">With steady eye he views the concourse vast ,</l>
     <l n="13">Big thoughts fast welling from his inmost soul</l>

     <l n="25">A family of eight appears</l>
     <l n="26">For thee to love and serve , my wife !</l>
     <l n="27">Thou wert indeed a youthful bride ,</l>
     <l n="28">But weak in body — not in heart —</l>
     <l n="29">As thou my cherished hearth beside</l>
     <l n="30">Sat down , content to do thy part .</l>
     <l n="31">And well I know</l>
     <l n="32">No lot below</l>
     <l n="33">Was e'er more free from earthly woe .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="34">In this review I can n't forget</l>
     <l n="35">How oft in sickness , grief and pain ,</l>
     <l n="36">Thy loving heart our needs has met ,</l>
     <l n="37">While solace rich came in thy train .</l>
     <l n="38">Nor when thyself on sick bed lay ,</l>
     <l n="39">Racked with Neuralgia 's maddening pangs .</l>
     <l n="40">How Patience kept the wolf at bay ,</l>
     <l n="41">And made him soon withdraw his fangs .</l>
     <l n="42">My darling sweet ,</l>
     <l n="43">‘ Tis surely meet</l>
     <l n="44">I thee with song like this should greet !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="45">Nor yet when by that dreadful fall</l>
     <l n="46">Thy limbs were bruised , thy system shook ,</l>
     <l n="47">How easily I can recall</l>
     <l n="48">Each winning smile , each tender look ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="49">As I attempted to alleve</l>
     <l n="50">Thy sufferings great for many days .</l>
     <l n="51">And while I could not help but grieve ,</l>
     <l n="52">I saw thy meekness with amaze ;</l>
     <l n="53">For no dread pain</l>
     <l n="54">Could triumph gain</l>
     <l n="55">O'er thee , nor did'st thou once complain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="56">Then , O my darling , join with me</l>
     <l n="57">To celebrate our Father 's praise !</l>
     <l n="58">For he has kept us lovingly</l>
     <l n="59">From hankering after worldly ways .</l>
     <l n="60">Raise then our Ebenezer high !</l>
     <l n="61">Join , children , in my joyful song !</l>
     <l n="62">Lay ever disagreement by ,</l>
     <l n="63">That you in , union may be strong .</l>
     <l n="64">Thus let us wait</l>
     <l n="65">At Wisdom 's gate ,</l>
     <l n="66">Till Christ in turn shall each translate .</l>

    <head>FAREWELL TO MY HARP</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Farewell my rude Harp and my still ruder Lyre !</l>
     <l n="2">For season your tones may not fall on my ear ;</l>
     <l n="3">At the bench will hard labor repress rhyming fire ,</l>
     <l n="4">And Fact over Fancy triumphant appear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Yet I will remember the exquisite pleasure</l>
     <l n="6">For full thirty years freely rendered by you ;</l>
     <l n="7">How oft in that time you have proved a rich treasure —</l>
     <l n="8">Still constant abiding and evermore true .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Again and again bring afresh to my mind .</l>
     <l n="10">How in youth your wild minstrelsy ravished my soul</l>
     <l n="11">Till I became daily to musings inclined ,</l>
     <l n="12">And strong , gushing impulse that scarce brooked control .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">I oft will recall how you chased away sadness ,</l>
     <l n="14">As sore family tumbles my heart did affright</l>
     <l n="15">When a fond , faithful partner , whose presence was gladness</l>
     <l n="16">Was reft from my side — turning day into night !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Nor forget soon the dirges you poured o'er the tomb</l>
     <l n="18">Enclosing both her and our infant so dear ;</l>
     <l n="19">Whose soul-stirring notes dissipated my gloom ,</l>
     <l n="20">And since have refreshed me through many a year .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">Ah , no ! those sweet memories , fresh in me springing ,</l>
     <l n="22">Shall nerve to new efforts in God 's holy cause ;</l>
     <l n="23">And hearing within me your melodies ringing ,</l>
     <l n="24">I 'll steadfastly aim at observing His Laws .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>THE END .</p>
