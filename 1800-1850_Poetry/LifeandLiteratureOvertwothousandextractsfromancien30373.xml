   <p>A good action performed in this world receives its recompense in the other , just as water poured at the root of a tree appears again above in fruit and flower .</p>

   <p>It is a disingenuous thing to ask for advice , when you mean assistance ; and it will be a just punishment if you get that which you pretended to want .</p>
   <p>— Sir A . Helps .</p>

    <head>THE APPROACH OF AGE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Six years had passed , and forty ere the six ,</l>
     <l n="2">When time began to play his usual tricks ;</l>
     <l n="3">The locks once comely in a virgin 's sight ,</l>
     <l n="4">Locks of pure brown , displayed the encroaching white ;</l>
     <l n="5">The blood , once fervid , now to cool began ,</l>
     <l n="6">And Time 's strong pressure to subdue the man .</l>
     <l n="7">I rode or walked as I was wont before ,</l>
     <l n="8">But now the bounding spirit was no more ;</l>
     <l n="9">A moderate pace would now my body heat ,</l>
     <l n="10">A walk of moderate length distress my feet .</l>
     <l n="11">I showed my stranger guest those hills sublime ,</l>
     <l n="12">But said , “ The view is poor , we need not climb . ”</l>
     <l n="13">At a friend 's mansion I began to dread</l>
     <l n="14">The cold neat parlor and gay glazed bed ;</l>
     <l n="15">At home I felt a more decided taste ,</l>
     <l n="16">And must have all things in my order placed .</l>
     <l n="17">I ceased to hunt ; my horses pleased me less —</l>
     <l n="18">My dinner more ; I learned to play at chess .</l>
     <l n="19">I took my dog and gun , but saw the brute</l>
     <l n="20">Was disappointed that I did not shoot .</l>
     <l n="21">My morning walks I now could bear to lose ,</l>
     <l n="22">And blessed the shower that gave me not to choose .</l>
     <l n="23">In fact , I felt a languor stealing on ;</l>
     <l n="24">The active arm , the agile hand , were gone ;</l>
     <l n="25">Small daily actions into habits grew ,</l>
     <l n="26">And new dislike to forms and fashions new .</l>
     <l n="27">I loved my trees in order to dispose ;</l>
     <l n="28">I numbered peaches , looked how stocks arose ;</l>
     <l n="29">Told the same story oft — in short , began to prose .</l>

   <p>A few years ago a well-known Bostonian , the descendant of an honored family , began the ancestral quest with expert assistance . All went merry as a marriage bell for a time , when suddenly he unearthed an unsavory scandal that concerned one of his progenitors . Feeling a responsibility for the misdeeds of his great-grandfather , he ordered all investigation stopped , and the disagreeable data destroyed ; but he had delved too far . His genealogist had told a friend , and the secret was out beyond recall .</p>

   <p>HIS CREATURES .</p>
   <p>The daughter of an army officer , whose life had been spent in the far west , told the following anecdote : “ Indians , when they accept Christianity , very often hold its truths with peculiar simplicity .</p>
   <p>“ There was near our fort an old chief called Tassorah . One day , when I was an impulsive girl , I was in a rage at my pony , and dismounting , beat him severely . The old man stood by , silent for a moment .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ What words have I heard from Jesus ? ’ he said , sternly . ‘ If you love not your brother whom you have seen , how can you love God whom you have not seen ? ’</p>
   <p>“ ‘ This horse is not my brother ! ’ I said scornfully .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ The old man laid his hand on the brute 's head and turned it toward me .</l>
     <l n="2">The eyes were full of terror .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ ‘ Is not God his creator ? Must He not care for him ? ’ he said . ‘ Not a</l>
     <l n="4">sparrow falls to the ground without His notice . ’</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ I never forgot the lesson . It flashed on me then for the first time that the dog that ran beside me , the birds , the very worms were His , and I , too , was one of His great family . ”</p>
   <p>82</p>
   <p>Kindness to animals is no unworthy exercise of benevolence . We hold that the life of brutes perishes with their breath , and that they are never to be clothed again with consciousness . The inevitable shortness then of their existence should plead for them touchingly . The insects on the surface of the water , poor ephemeral things , who would needlessly abridge their dancing pleasure of to-day ? Such feelings we should have towards the whole animate creation .</p>

    <head>APPEARANCES OFTEN MISUNDERSTOOD .</head>
     <l n="1">Sometimes our estimate of men and women</l>
     <l n="2">On short acquaintance is very much at fault .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>A gentleman and his wife — Pierrepont by name — passengers on one of the great Atlantic steamers , not knowing any of the other passengers , kept very much to themselves ; he usually reading aloud to his wife , and she occupied in some needle work ; for this , they were commented upon , and not very favorably , and generally were called the “ stupid couple . ” Little did these same passengers know the true character of that gentleman and lady . An incident that occurred on board soon proved the bravery and heroism of the one , and the gentleness and self-sacrifice of the other . The captain had with him his only son , a boy of some eight summers , a great favorite of all on board from fore to aft . The little fellow , climbing on the side of the ship , somehow fell overboard . The lady happening to be on the other side of the deck , saw the child climb up , and immediately missed him . She quickly laid her hand on her husband 's shoulder , looking in his eyes , and cried out , “ Oh , save the boy , he has fallen overboard . ” In one moment he was on his feet , kicked off his canvas shoes , threw his hat on the deck , and turning his face toward the bridge , where he knew some of the ship 's officers were always stationed , he called out in a voice which rang like a trumpet call over the ship , “ Man overboard . ” Then , with a quick run and leap , he cleared the rail , and the broken twisting water of the ship 's track had closed over him . He was on the surface again in a moment , and taking a glance back at the ship to know his position , stretched out into a long steady stroke in the direction where he knew the child was .</p>
   <p>Instantly the captain 's hand was on the engine-room telegraph , and down into the depths of the ship went the signals . First to “ stop , ” and the tremor all over the ship ceased . The bell rang again , and the index moved to “ astern-slow ; ” then in a minute or two , to , “ half ; ” then he called out to the second officer — “ Man overboard ! Stand by to lower away the gig , ” which was quickly obeyed , and four hands , a coxswain , and a man for the boat 's bow were instantly off and rowed fiercely .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">In a little while Mrs. Pierrepont — who was on the bridge with Captain</l>
     <l n="2">Hood — said , “ Do you see them ; are they together ? ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Yes , ” replied the captain , “ I believe they are . ” But his voice was now broken , and he took hold of Mrs. Pierrepont 's hand . “ I have watched my child from here with the glass , till at last he floated so low that I could scarcely see him , and just as he seemed sinking your husband dashed across the spot where he was , and I saw by a wave of his hand towards the ship that he caught him . He is now waiting for the boat . ”</p>
   <p>It was getting dark when they returned . The child , who was shivering , was immediately carried away to have a warm bath , and a little later was in the saloon with dry clothes on , as merry as if nothing had happened .</p>
   <p>When Pierrepont stepped on the deck , a rush was made at him , and both hands were shaken till he thought his arms would be pulled off .</p>
   <p>The captain said all he had to say in a very few words , and with a hand-grasp which said more than words .</p>

    <head>Who , coming to this sacred book , with a sincere desire to know God 's will for the direction of his life , will say that he can not find it ? Who , desiring to be instructed in the way of salvation “ through faith which is in Christ Jesus , ” will consult its pages , and say it is not made plain to him ? Who , coming to it for equipment of his spiritual life , will say that there are still needs of that life which are left unprovided for ? Who , seeking direction in the way of the life everlasting , can doubt that , if he faithfully obeys its teaching , he will reach that goal ? The Scripture fulfils the ends for which it was given ; no higher proof of its inspiration can be demanded . * * * * * What the closing verse of the 20th chapter of John 's Gospel says of that book : “ But these are written , that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God , and that believing ye may have life through His name , ” may with equal truth be applied to the Bible as a whole .</head>

    <head>BOOKS .</head>
    <head>The feeling that books are real friends is constantly present to all who love reading . “ I have friends , ” said Petrarch , “ whose society is extremely agreeable to me , they are of all ages , and of every country . They have distinguished themselves both in the cabinet and in the field , and obtained high honors for their knowledge of the sciences . It is easy to gain access to them , for they are always at my service , and I admit them to my company , and dismiss them from it , whenever I please . They are never troublesome , but immediately answer every question I ask them . Some relate to me the events of past ages , while others reveal to me the secrets of Nature . Some teach me how to live , and others how to die . Some , by their vivacity , drive away my cares and exhilarate my spirits ; while others give fortitude to my mind , and teach me the important lesson how to deport myself , and to depend wholly on myself . They open to me , in short , the various avenues of all the arts and sciences and upon their information I may safely rely in all emergencies . In return for all their services , they only ask me to accommodate them with a convenient chamber in some corner of my humble habitation where they may repose in peace ; for these friends are more delighted by the tranquility of retirement than with the tumults of society . ”</head>

    <head>Books introduce us into the best society ; they bring us into the presence of the greatest minds that have ever lived . We hear what they said and did ; we see them as if they were really alive ; we are participators in their thoughts ; we sympathize with them , enjoy with them , grieve with them ; their experience becomes ours , and we feel as if we were in a measure actors with them in the scenes which they describe .</head>

   <p>Those who have collected books , and whose good nature has prompted them to accommodate their friends with them , will feel the sting of the answer made by a man of wit to one who lamented the difficulty which he found in persuading his friends to return the volumes that he had lent them :</p>
   <p>“ Sir , ” said he , “ your acquaintances find , I suppose , that it is much more easy to retain the books themselves , than what is contained in them . ”</p>

   <p>John Ruskin , in one of his lectures , said : “ There is just this difference between the making of a girl 's character and a boy 's : You may chisel a boy into shape as you would a rock , or hammer him into it , if he be of a better kind , as you would a piece of bronze ; but you can not hammer a girl into anything . She grows as a flower does — she will wither without sun ; she will decay in her sheath as a narcissus will if you do not give her air enough ; she must take her own fair form and way if she take any , and in mind as in body , must have always —</p>

     <l n="2">And steps of virgin liberty . ’ ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>You bring up your girls as if they were meant for sideboard ornaments , and then complain of their frivolity . Give them the same advantages that you give their brothers ; teach them , that courage and truth are the pillars of their being .</p>
   <p>Again : “ The man 's work for his own home , is to secure its maintenance , progress , and defence ; the woman 's to secure its order , comfort , and loveliness .</p>
   <p>“ What the man is at his own gate , defending it if need be , against insult and spoil , that also , not in a less , but in a more devoted measure , he is to be at the gate of his country , leaving his home , if need be , even to the spoiler , to do his more incumbent work there .</p>
   <p>“ And in like manner what the woman is to be within her gates , as the centre of order , the balm of distress , and the mirror of beauty , that she is also to be without her gates , where order is more difficult , distress more imminent , loveliness more rare . ”</p>

   <p>Climate — The climate of Great Britain , as that of no other country in a like latitude , derives its peculiarity from its situation and from the prevailing winds , which are from the southwest , except in the months of April and May . The thermometer for six months in the year averages near 60 degrees , and seldom , if ever , drops below 36 degrees during the remaining six months , thus affording , according to all authorities , one of the healthiest climates in the world .</p>

   <p>A Saying of Napoleon — Once at St. Helena , when walking with a lady , some servants came along carrying a load . The lady , in an angry tone , ordered them out of the way , on which Napoleon interposed , saying , “ Respect the burden , madam . ” Even the drudgery of the humblest laborer contributes towards the general well-being of society ; and it was a wise saying of a Chinese Emperor that , “ If there was a man who did not work , or a woman that was idle , somebody must suffer cold or hunger in the Empire . ”</p>

   <p>WHAT WE OWE TO ROBERT BURNS .</p>
   <p>Burns has been one of the world awakeners . His voice rang out of the stillness , like the clear sweet notes of a bugle horn , and his songs were sung with a nerve and strength of nature that stirred to its depths the popular heart .</p>
   <p>Describing Robert Burns ’ conversational gifts , Mr. Carlyle wrote : “ They were the theme of all that ever heard him . All kinds of gifts , from the gracefullest allusions of courtesy to the highest fire of passionate speech , loud floods of mirth , soft wailings of affection , laconic emphasis , clear piercing insight , all were in him . ”</p>
   <p>He awoke the poor and the despised to the dignity of man as man , irrespective of the accidents of poverty or wealth .</p>

   <p>LONDON MISSIONARY SOCIETY .</p>
   <p>Dr. Chalmers of Scotland , arrived in London , on the 13th of May , 1817 , and on the following day preached in Surrey Chapel , the anniversary sermon for the London Missionary Society . Although the service did not commence till eleven o'clock , at seven in the morning the chapel was crowded to excess , and many thousands went off for want of room . He rose and gave out his text from 1 Cor . xiv , 22-25 . He had not proceeded many minutes till his voice gradually expanded in strength and compass , reaching every part of the house and commanding universal attention . His sermon occupied about an hour and a half in the delivery . A gentleman wrote to a friend : “ I have just heard and witnessed the most astonishing display of human talent that perhaps ever commanded hearing ; all my expectations were overwhelmed in the triumph of it . ”</p>
   <p>At an afternoon service he preached in the Scotch Church , in Swallow Street . On approaching the church , Dr. Chalmers and a friend found so dense a mass within , and before the building , as to give no hope of effecting an entrance by the mere force of ordinary pressure . Lifting his cane and gently tapping the heads of those who were in advance , Dr. Chalmers ’ friend exclaimed , “ Make way there , make way please , for Dr. Chalmers . ” The sturdy Londoners refused to move , believing it was a ruse . Forced to retire , Dr. Chalmers retreated from the outskirts of the crowd , crossed the street , stood for a few moments gazing on the growing tumult , and had almost resolved altogether to withdraw , as access by any of the ordinary entrances was impossible . At last a plank was projected from one of the windows very near the pulpit , till it rested on an iron palisade , and the Doctor and others gained entrance . The impression produced by the service which followed , when all had at last settled down into stillness , was deeper than that made by any of those which preceded it .</p>

    <head>Did you ever see the horses taken to water ? They rush into some beautiful stream , and drink of it to their heart 's content ; after which they turn their backs upon it , or stamp in it with their feet , until the water is polluted . This is the price they pay for their refreshing draught . But what , then does the noble river ? It immediately floats away the mud , and continues after , as it was before , full and free of access for the same or other thirsty creatures . And so must you also do . If there be a fountain of genuine charity in your heart , it will constantly , and spontaneously overflow , whether those who drink of it are thankful or not .

   <p>Mr. H ——, an ingenious artist , being driven out of all employment , and reduced to great distress , had no resource to which to apply except that of an elder brother , who was in good circumstances . To him , therefore , he applied , and begged some little hovel to live in , and some small provision for his support . The brother melted into tears , and said , “ You , my dear brother ! You live in a hovel ! You are a man ; you are an honor to the family . I am nothing . You shall take this house and the estate , and I will be your guest , if you please . ” The brothers lived together without its being distinguishable who was proprietor of the estate , till the death of the elder put the artist in possession of it .</p>

    <head>A SERMON OF MOHAMMED .</head>
    <head>When God made the earth , it shook to and fro till He put mountains on it to keep it firm . Then the angels asked , “ O God , is there anything in Thy creation stronger than these mountains ? ” And God replied , “ Iron is stronger than the mountains , for it breaks them . ” “ And is there anything in Thy creation stronger than iron ? ” “ Yes , fire is stronger than iron , for it melts it . ” “ Is there anything stronger than fire ? ” “ Yes , water , for it quenches fire . ” “ Is there anything stronger than water ? ” “ Yes , wind , for it puts water in motion . ” “ O , our Sustainer , is there anything in Thy creation stronger than wind ? ” “ Yes , a good man giving alms ; if he gives it with his right hand , and conceals it from his left , he overcomes all things . ” Every good act is charity ; your smiling in your brother 's face , your putting a wanderer in the right road , your giving water to the thirsty is charity ; exhortation to another to do right is charity . A man 's true wealth hereafter is the good he has done in this world to his fellowmen . When he dies , people will ask : “ What property has he left behind him ? ” But the angels will ask : “ What good deeds has he sent before him ? ”</head>

   <p>One day a little girl looking out of the window saw a number of poor men from a nearby jail , working in the hot sun of a July day . They looked tired and hot , and she knew they must be thirsty . She remembered Christ 's words , “ I was thirsty and ye gave Me drink , was in prison , and ye came unto Me , ” and the thought came to her , “ I can do both . ” With her mother 's permission she took a little bucket of cold water , with a dipper , and gave to each man in turn , refilling the bucket several times . As she went from one to another in her white frock , her sweet smile gave even better cheer than the water . The thanks of the prisoners were very hearty . One asked her , “ Little lady , what made you do this ? ”</p>
   <p>After a moment 's pause , she replied , “ That is what Christ said to do , and — I was sorry myself . ” He lowered his head and said , “ God bless you , little Christ-child . ”</p>

In a narrative of his experience , he remarks , “ I reflect on it as a great mercy , that I was born in a family which took care of my Christian instruction , and in which I had the privilege of God 's worship , morning and evening . About the eighth year of my age , I happened , in a crowd , to push into the church at Abernethy , on a Sacrament Sabbath . Before I was excluded , I heard a minister speak much in commendation of Christ ; this , in a sweet and delightful manner , captivated my young affections , and has since made me think that children should never be kept out of church on such occasions . ”</p>

    <head>THE CHILD AND THE “ RISING DAY ”</head>
     <l n="1">The following is a true narrative of an experience in life :</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It was nearing three o'clock of last Easter afternoon , when a woman , clad in deepest mourning , entered the gates of the beautiful “ sleeping place ” on Walnut Hill . Her attitude , as she sank upon a carefully tended mound , denoted deep dejection . She had not yet learned that the “ tree of death is fruited with the love of God , ” neither the joy of the “ afterward , ” but knew only the grope of a stricken soul .</p>
   <p>In the distance , sat a child upon a grave , alone . Coming nearer , she recognized him as one who had never known a mother , and whose father had lately been taken , leaving him without kindred . The love between that father and child had been passing sweet .</p>
   <p>The bereaved lady knew this , and that he had been thrown homeless upon the world . Yet , absorbed in her own grief , had given him little thought . Drawing near , she observed closely the rare beauty of the boy , scarcely five years of age , genius and nobility stamped on his brow , and exquisite tenderness on the mobile lips .</p>
   <p>He looked up eagerly , asking fearlessly , “ Is your name Mary ? Are you the woman who talked with the angel when the stone was rolled away . ”</p>
   <p>“ Oh , no , dear , ” she replied . “ Whom are you looking for ? ”</p>
   <p>“ For Jesus ! ” said the boy reverently .</p>
   <p>“ But he is not here . He is risen . ”</p>
   <p>“ Yes , I know , that 's it , but I 've been waiting here all day for Him to come and raise my papa up . He 's late , and I thought maybe He sent you to tell me to wait a little , just as He sent Mary to tell His disciples , you know , ” said the boy , wistfully .</p>
   <p>“ Yes , dear , but ” — hesitating to shatter the boy 's beautiful faith .</p>
   <p>“ I am tired ” ( pathetically ) , “ but it is never too late for Jesus , ” he added bravely , while a tear rolled down the velvet cheek . “ He is sure to come , ‘ cause it is the Rising Day ” ( exultingly ) . “ Do n't you ‘ member ? ”</p>
   <p>The woman stooped to kiss the child , and began to sob violently , dropping on the grave beside him .</p>
   <p>“ What makes you cry , lady ? Is your papa here to be raised up ? ”</p>
   <p>“ No , no , darling , but my sweet daughter is . ”</p>
   <p>“ Do n't cry , then , ” stroking the lady 's hand . “ Jesus never goes by Rising Day . He 'll surely come and give you your little girl and me my papa ! He 'll come to-night . I saw the two men who came from [ 256 : A ] Emmaus go by early this morning , and they will be walking back soon in the evening , and Jesus will meet them and turn and walk with them , and they will all be talking gently about the dying and the rising , and the men will not know Him , but I shall , and He will stop here when I call , and raise my papa up . ”</p>
   <p>“ How will you know Him , dear boy ? ”</p>
   <p>“ By His smile and the Transfiguration picture that papa showed me in his study . But I 'll know Him bestest in here , ” putting his hand on his breast , “ by the love ! ” raising his lustrous eyes to hers .</p>
   <p>“ Will you know your papa ? Are you sure ? ”</p>
   <p>“ My papa ! ” with wondering ecstatic voice . “ My own papa ! I shall know him by the love , and you your little girl . They will not look the same , ‘ cause Jesus did n't , but they knew Him by their love ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Yes ? ”</p>
   <p>“ And we 'll know them by our love ! ” lingering fondly on the repetition with lustrous , far-seeing gaze .</p>
   <p>The woman clasped the child to her breast with a passionate embrace , while rising to meet a supreme hour . ( The child must not — shall not be disappointed and his beautiful faith shattered ) .</p>
   <p>“ Phillip ! ” she said , “ listen . The angel sent me to tell you that Jesus had gone into heaven , and to take you to your papa . Come ! ”</p>
   <p>Without a moment 's hesitation he took his messenger 's (? ) hand and passed out of the gates , looking not backward by a glance . Expectation held him silent , while the woman 's face was illumined by a great light . Entering the door of a pleasant house , she passed on through the hall into the dining-room , saying to the maid : “ Bring some food for this dear child ; he has fasted all day . ”</p>
   <p>A pitcher of milk and a plate of bread and honey were set beside a plate of cold , broiled fish .</p>
   <p>“ Now I know this is the house , ” the boy exclaimed exultingly , “ for they had the fish , the bread and the honey ! It 's all here , just the same , and he 'll come to-night ! ”</p>
   <p>Turning swiftly to the hall , the woman almost flew along the corridor to meet her husband 's steps . Drawing him to one side , she told with rapture of her encounter and the sweet expectancy below .</p>
   <p>“ Now , Harold , Heaven has sent us a child , who shall be the angel to roll away the stone from our grave . His wonderful vision must not be darkened , neither his faith destroyed . Rise , my husband , to the most glorious hour of your life . ‘ I shall know him by the love , ’ he said . Let us see that he does . ”</p>
   <p>Returning for the child and extending her hand with a smile , he eagerly asked , “ Will you wash and comb me to meet my papa ? It is n't too late yet , is it ? ”</p>
   <p>The voice was half a sob , but full of hope . The ineffable trust pierced her heart while reassuring him with swift , tender tones .</p>
   <p>“ Come , Phillip , we will go to him , ” she cried tremblingly .</p>
   <p>As she opened the door upon a winning , noble-faced man with tears on his cheek , smiling with outstretched arms upon the boy , he hesitated a moment , took one step forward and then leaped into the open arms , threw his noble head back , and gazed with lustrous , questioning eyes .</p>
   <p>“ You do n't look like my papa , quite . ”</p>
   <p>“ No ? ” ( anxiously ) .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Cause you are changed . But I know you by the love , and you know me , do n't you ? ”</p>
   <p>“ By the love , dear boy , ” with shining eyes , but marble lips .</p>
   <p>The child nestled down upon the breast , his chest heaving , while the man stroked the soft curls , soothing him with every word known to love 's alphabet , till finally , crooning a cradle song , the exhausted child fell asleep . He had found a father by the love . His faith was saved , and by it , she who had groped blindly among the tombs had found her Easter .</p>

   <p>The way to spoil a child is to give it all it wants and require nothing in return . The way to make a child grow up sensible and unselfish is to give it little , and require of it much . For it is not what others do for us that benefits us , but what we do for ourselves and others .</p>

   <p>Their Little Needs — It is often asserted that both men and women would be selfish beings but for children . They call out , and refine , and soften the best feelings of the parental heart . Their little needs are so many , and their simple ignorance so affecting , and their very caprices so winning , that love and attention flow out to them almost instinctively .</p>
   <p>That must be a hardened nature which can be unmoved by the soft touch , the playful childishness , and the hundred little pranks of a baby .</p>

   <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE PERSON OF JESUS CHRIST .</p>
   <p>The following description is alleged to be derived from an ancient manuscript sent by Publius Lentellus , President of Judea , to the Senate of Rome :</p>
   <p>“ There lives at this time in Judea , a man of singular character , whose name is Jesus Christ . The barbarians esteem Him as their prophet ; but His followers adore Him as the immediate offspring of the immortal God . He is endowed with such unparalleled virtue as to call back the dead from their graves and to heal every kind of disease with a word or a touch . His person is tall and elegantly shaped ; His aspect , amiable and reverend ; His hair flows in those beauteous shades which no united colors can match , falling in graceful curls below His ears , agreeably couching on His shoulders , and parting on the crown of His head ; His dress , that of the sect of Nazarites ; His forehead is smooth and large ; His cheeks without blemish , and of roseate hue ; His nose and mouth are formed with exquisite symmetry ; His beard is thick and suitable to the hair of His head , reaching a little below His chin , and parting in the middle below ; His eyes are clear , bright , and serene .</p>
   <p>“ He rebukes with mildness , and invokes with the most tender and persuasive language — His whole address , whether in word or deed , being elegantly grave , and strictly characteristic of so exalted a being . No man has seen Him laugh , but the whole world beholds Him weep frequently , and so persuasive are His tears that the whole multitude can not withhold their tears from joining in sympathy with Him . He is moderate , temperate , and wise ; in short , whatever the phenomenon may turn out in the end , He seems at present to be a man of excellent beauty and Divine perfection , every way surpassing man . ”</p>

   <p>As Henry Drummond , on board a government packet , was steaming away from that group of islands known as the New Hebrides , after having visited the missions there , he was asked by a fellow-passenger who had been visiting the islands for a very different purpose , what good the missionary had been to those people . “ My dear young man , ” said Drummond , “ only for the missionary , you and I , instead of being in this cabin , would probably by this time have been inside some of those savages , as you call them , who waved us such an affectionate farewell from their shores . ” Yes , Christianity is now recognized the world over , as foremost among the moral forces that are civilizing the dark corners of the earth . Even Matthew Arnold was forced to admit that there is no civilization without it . “ Show me , ” he said , “ ten square miles outside of Christianity where the life of man or woman is safe , and I 'll throw over Christianity at once . ”</p>

    <head>HOW THE CHURCH MUST GROW .</head>
    <head>It has seemed sometimes in recent years as if the deaths were more than the births . This has brought home to the Church the absolute need of the revival of religion if Christianity is not to perish from the world which it has re-made . The Church is not an establishment in the world , but an encampment . She has no natural increase . She lives only by capture , by winning over from the world the citizens that make her number . One must arm another with the Christian panoply , if the Church is to continue .</head>

   <p>Covetousness .— A young man once picked up a sovereign lying in the road . Ever afterward , in walking along , he kept his eye fixed steadily upon the ground in hopes to find another . And in the course of a long life he did pick up , at different times , a goodly number of coins , gold and silver . But all these years , while he was looking for them , he saw not that the heavens were bright above him , and nature beautiful around . He never once allowed his eye to look up from the mud and filth in which he sought his treasure ; and when he died — a rich old man — he only knew this fair earth as a dirty road to pick up money as you walk along . Thus you see the desire of having is the sin of covetousness .</p>

    <head>THE REPROOF OF A FOOL .</head>
    <head>There was a certain nobleman who kept a fool , to whom he one day gave a staff , with a charge to keep it till he should meet with one who was a greater fool than himself . Not many years after , the nobleman fell sick , even unto death . The fool came to see him : his lord said to him — “ I must shortly leave you . ” “ And whither are you going ? ” said the fool . “ Into another world , ” replied his lordship . “ And when will you come again ? Within a month ? ” “ No . ” “ Within a year ? ” “ No . ” “ When then ? ” “ Never . ” “ Never ! ” said the fool , “ and what provision hast thou made for thy entertainment there , whither thou goest ? ” “ None at all . ” “ No ! ” said the fool , “ none at all ! Here then , take my staff ; for with all my folly , I am not guilty of any such folly as this . ”</head>

   <p>RISE ABOVE YOUR DIFFICULTIES .</p>
   <p>Not till after the death of a member of Parliament , a prominent county magistrate , the owner of large estates , and an active , public-spirited man in all local and national matters , was it known by those who had not seen him , that it was but the misshapen block of a man that had lived this active , manly life .</p>
   <p>He was born with neither legs nor arms . After his death his story was told : how he resolved , when but a boy , to act and live as did other boys , without regard to his horrible misfortune ; how he persisted in studying every book , in learning every game , in joining in every amusement possible to him , with his companions . How , to the last year of his life , he held himself to be as responsible as other men , and bravely paid every tithe of duty to God and to his fellows .</p>
   <p>Even in lesser matters in life he pressed to the front . He was the most genial , witty guest at social dinner tables . Strapped to his horse , he hunted foxes in Yorkshire , or tigers in India , and with his brothers made long journeys in other parts of the world . Everywhere his cheerfulness and gaiety gave new life to duller souls .</p>
   <p>Is there no lesson for us all in the life of this gallant gentleman ?</p>

   <p>A heathen king , who had been for years confirmed in the sin of drunkenness by the evil practices of white men on the Sandwich Islands , had been led to forsake the dreadful habit . He said lately to a missionary , “ suppose you put four thousand dollars in one hand , and a glass of rum in the other ; you say , you drink this rum , I give you four thousand dollars , I no drink it ; you say you kill me , I no drink it . ”</p>

   <p>A person in Maryland , who was addicted to drunkenness , hearing a considerable uproar in his kitchen one night , felt the curiosity to step without noise to the door , to know what was the matter ; when he found his servants indulging in the most unbounded roars of laughter at a couple of negro boys , who were mimicking himself in his drunken fits !— as how he reeled and staggered — how he looked and nodded — and hiccupped and tumbled . The pictures which these children of nature drew of him , and which had filled the rest with such inexhaustible merriment , struck him with so salutary a disgust , that from that night he became a perfectly sober man , to the great joy of his wife and children .</p>

   <p>Pray tell me whence you derive the origin of the word dun ? The true origin of this expression owes its birth to one Joe Dunn , a famous bailiff of the town of Lincoln , England , so extremely active , and so dexterous at the management of his rough business , that it became a proverb , when a man refused to pay his debts , “ Why do n't you Dun him ? ” that is , why do n't you send Dun to arrest him ? Hence it grew a custom , and is now as old as since the days of Henry VII .</p>

    <head>EXTERNAL SIGNS OF EMOTIONS AND PASSIONS .</head>
    <head>One would not imagine who has not given particular attention , that the body should be susceptible to such variety of attitudes and emotions , as readily to accompany every different emotion with a corresponding expression . Humility for example , is expressed naturally by hanging the head ; arrogance , by its elevation ; and languor or despondence , by reclining it to one side . The expressions of the hands are manifold by different attitudes and motions ; they express desire , hope , fear ; they assist us in promising , in inviting , in keeping one at a distance ; they are made instruments of threatening , of supplication , of praise , and of horror ; they are employed in approving , in refusing , in questioning ; in showing our joy , our sorrow , our doubts , our regret , and our admiration .</head>

   <p>Boswell said of Dr. Johnson — “ Though a stern true-born Englishman , and fully prejudiced against all other nations , he had discernment enough to see , and candour enough to censure , the cold reserve too common among Englishmen towards strangers . ‘ Sir , ’ said he , ( Johnson ) ‘ two men of any other nation who are shown into a room together , at a house where they are both visitors , will immediately find some conversation . But two Englishmen will probably go each to a different window , and remain in obstinate silence . Sir , we as yet do not enough understand the common rights of humanity . ’ ”</p>

   <p>Among all classes of society we see extravagance keeping pace with prosperity , and indeed outstripping it , realizing Archbishop Whately 's paradox : “ The larger the income , the harder it is to live within it . ”</p>

    <head>THE MOUNTAIN FLOWER .</head>
    <head>In Ross-shire , Scotland , there is an immense mountain gorge . The rocks have been rent in twain , and set apart twenty feet , forming two perpendicular walls two hundred feet in height . On either side of these natural walls , in crevices where earth has collected , grow wild flowers of rare quality and beauty . A company of tourists visiting that part of the country were desirous to possess themselves of specimens of these beautiful mountain flowers ; but how to obtain them they knew not . At length they thought they might be gathered by suspending a person over the cliff by a rope . They offered a Highland boy , who was near by , a handsome sum of money to undertake the difficult and dangerous task . The boy looked down into the awful abyss that yawned below , and shrunk from the undertaking ; but the money was tempting . Could he confide in the strangers ? Could he venture his life in their hands ? He felt that he could not ; but he thought of his father , and , looking once more at the cliff , and then at the proffered reward , his eyes brightened , and he exclaimed : “ I 'll go if my father holds the rope . ” Beautiful illustration of the nature of faith .</head>

    <head>MAN AND THE FARM .</head>
    <head>It is a common complaint that the farm and farm life are not appreciated by our people . We long for the more elegant pursuits , or the ways and fashions , of the town . But the farmer has the most sane and natural occupation , and ought to find it sweeter , if less highly seasoned , than any other . He alone , strictly speaking , has a home . How many ties , how many resources , he has !— his friendship with his cattle , his team , his dog , his trees ; the satisfaction in his growing crops , in his improved fields ; his intimacy with nature , with bird and beast , and with the quickening elemental forces ; his co-operations with the cloud , the sun , the seasons , heat , wind , rain , frost . It humbles him , teaches him patience and reverence . Cling to the farm , make much of it , put yourself into it , bestow your heart and brain upon it .</head>

   <p>Love for a Father .— In the year 1773 , a gentleman in England , whose health was rapidly declining , was advised by his physicians to go to Spa for the recovery of his health . His daughters feared that those who had only motives entirely mercenary would not pay him that attention which he might expect from those who , from duty and affection united , would feel the greatest pleasure in ministering to his ease and comfort ; they , therefore , resolved to accompany him . They proved that it was not a spirit of dissipation and gaiety that led them to the springs , for they were not to be seen in any of the gay and fashionable circles ; they were never out of their father 's company , and never stirred from home , except to attend him , either to take the air or drink the waters ; in a word , they lived a most recluse life in the midst of a town then the resort of the most illustrious and fashionable personages of Europe . This exemplary attention to their father procured these three amiable sisters the admiration of all the visitors at Spa , and was the cause of their elevation to that rank in life to which their merits gave them so just a title . They were all married to noblemen : one to the Earl of Beverly , another to the Duke of Hamilton , and a third to the Duke of Northumberland . And it is justice to them to say that they reflected honor on their rank , rather than derived any from it .</p>

   <p>Boswell : “ No quality will get a man more friends than a disposition to admire the qualities of others . I do not mean flattery , but a sincere admiration . ” Johnson : “ Nay , Sir , flattery pleases very generally . In the first place , the flatterer may think what he says to be true ; but in the second place , whether he thinks so or not , he certainly thinks those whom he flatters of consequence enough to be flattered . ”</p>

His commanding officer was in despair as to what should be done . A fellow officer said , “ Suppose you try forgiveness . ” The guilty soldier was summoned . On being asked what he had to say in palliation of his offense , he hung his head and replied : “ Nothing , except I 'm very sorry . ” “ Well , ” said the officer , “ We have decided to forgive you . ” The culprit looked dazed , burst into tears , saluted , and went out to become one of the best soldiers in the army .</head>

    <head>RECOGNITION IN HEAVEN .</head>
    <head>Baxter said :— “ I must confess , as the experience of my own soul , that the expectation of loving my friends in heaven principally kindles my love to them while on earth . If I thought I should never know , and consequently never love them after this life , I should number them with temporal things , and love them as such ; but I now delightfully converse with my pious friends , in a firm persuasion that I shall converse with them forever ; and I take comfort in those that are dead or absent , believing that I shall shortly meet them in heaven , and love them with a heavenly love . ”</head>

    <head>REAL AND ARTIFICIAL GENTLEMEN .</head>
    <head>A friend of mine , not long ago , coming over from Ireland , heard a man asking , in reference to another , who he was . “ I do n't know , ” was the reply ; “ but he 's quite a gentleman . He always wears a tall hat . ” Indeed , there are those who seem to be incapable of valuing their fellow-men by anything except their clothes . A story is told of a Persian prince , which well illustrates such worldliness . Dressed as a poor man , this prince went to a feast . He was pushed here and there , could not get to the table , and had soon to withdraw . On going home , he dressed himself in his best , placing jewelled slippers on his feet , and putting on a cloth-of-gold cloak . Then he returned to the feast , where matters were immediately altered . The guests made room , and the host , rushing up , cried , “ Welcome , my lord ! What will your lordship please to eat ? ” The prince 's answer was very expressive . Stretching out his foot , so that his slipper sparkled and glittered , he took his golden robe in his hand , and said with bitter irony , “ Welcome , my lord coat ! welcome , most excellent robe ! What will your lordship please to eat ? For , ” said he , turning to his surprised host , “ I ought to ask my coat what it will eat , since the welcome was solely to it . ”</head>

   <p>We never teach men to be gentlemen , but we teach them everything else ; and they never pique themselves so much on all the rest , as on knowing how to be gentlemen . They pique themselves only on knowing the one thing they have not learnt .</p>

   <p>The true gentleman is he who does not plume himself on anything .</p>
   <p>— Rochefoucauld .</p>
   <p>744</p>
   <p>Let him speak who received ; let the giver hold his peace .</p>

   <p>Give freely to him that deserveth well and asketh nothing ; and that is a way of giving to thyself .</p>

   <p>Better a penny given with a smile than a pound given with a frown .</p>

   <p>He gives twice who gives quickly , according to the proverb ; but a gift not only given quickly but unexpectedly , is the most welcome of all .</p>

   <p>THE EDUCATION OF GIRLS .</p>
   <p>The Princess of Wales has decided views on the education of children . Her Royal Highness , it appears , strongly objects to “ cramming ” children with useless learning , which she declares is a mere waste of time .</p>
   <p>The Princess considers it harmful to force a child in studies which are distasteful to it , and that the child should be allowed to abandon that study , and take up one it likes better .</p>
   <p>Similarly , she disapproves of advanced arithmetic for girls . She considers that all that most girls need ever know about arithmetic , is addition and subtraction , “ enough to know how to do their housekeeping and pay their debts , ” she says .</p>

    <head>THE HOUR GLASS</head>
    <head>Is an emblem of human life . Behold ! how swiftly the sands run , and how rapidly our lives are drawing to a close ! We cannot , without astonishment , behold the little particles which are contained in this machine ; how they pass away almost imperceptibly ! And yet , to our surprise , in the short space of an hour , they are all exhausted . Thus wastes man ! To-day he puts forth the tender leaves of hope ; to-morrow , blossoms , and bears his blushing honors thick upon him ; the next day comes a frost , which nips the shoot ; and when he thinks his greatness is still aspiring , he falls , like autumn leaves , to enrich our mother earth .</head>

   <p>The Greatness of God .— Said Dr. Guthrie , “ If philosophy is to be believed , our world is but an outlying corner of creation ; bearing , perhaps , as small a proportion to the great universe , as a single grain bears to all the sands of the seashore , or one small quivering leaf to the foliage of a boundless forest . ” Yet even within this earth 's narrow limits , how vast the work of Providence ! How soon is the mind lost in contemplating it ! How great that Being whose hand paints every flower , and shapes every leaf ; who forms every bud on every tree ; who feeds each crawling worm with a parent 's care , and watches like a mother over the insect that sleeps away the night in the bosom of a flower ; who throws open the golden gates of day , and draws around a sleeping world the dusky curtains of the night ; who measures out the drops of every shower , the whirling snowflakes , and the sands of man 's eventful life ; who determines alike the fall of a sparrow and the fate of a kingdom ; and so overrules the tide of human fortunes , that whatever befall him , come joy or sorrow , the believer says — “ It is the Lord ; let Him do what seemeth Him good . ”</p>
   <p>758</p>
   <p>But as it is written , “ Eye hath not seen , nor ear heard , neither have entered into the heart of man , the things which God hath prepared for them that love him . ”</p>

   <p>“ I know no duty in religion more generally agreed on , nor more justly required by God Almighty , than a perfect submission to His will in all things ; nor do I think any disposition of mind can either please Him more , or become us better , than that of being satisfied with all He gives , and contented with all He takes away . None , I am sure , can be of more honor to God , nor of more ease to ourselves . For , if we consider Him as our Maker , we cannot contend with Him ; if as our Father , we ought not to distrust Him : so that we may be confident whatever He does is intended for good ; and whatever happens that we interpret otherwise , yet we can get nothing by repining , nor save anything by resisting .</p>
   <p>Submission is the only way of reasoning between a creature and its Maker ; and contentment in His will is the greatest duty we can pretend to , and the best remedy we can apply to all our misfortunes . ”</p>

   <p>“ Maybe the remark of a child I once overheard helped me to learn to complain and grumble as little as possible , ” said Dr. Burt . “ While I was studying at Wilbraham Academy I spent a few days with this child 's father , a good man but a chronic growler . We were all sitting in the parlor one night , when the question of food arose . The child , a little girl , told cleverly what each member of the household liked best . Finally it came to the father 's turn to be described as to his favorite dish .</p>
   <p>‘ And what do I like , Lucy , my pet ? ’ he said , laughingly .</p>
   <p>‘ You , ’ said the little girl , slowly — ‘ well , papa , dear , you like most anything we have n't got . ’ ”</p>

   <p>Dr. Guthrie tells an anecdote in which he humorously introduces a Brechin citizen , alive in his youthful days :— “ An honest countryman came one day to Mr. Linton ( head master of the grammar school ) with a halflin [ 807 : A ] , a long , empty chap , who had taken it into his head that he would have some little learning . Said the father , ‘ Mr. Linton , ye see , my laddie 's fond o ’ lear '[ 807 : B ] , and I 'm thinking o ’ makin ’ a scholar o ’ him . ’ ‘ But , ’ said Mr. Linton , looking at the youth , and not seeing any sign that there was much in him , ‘ What are you to make of him ? ’ ‘ You see , Mr. Linton , ’ rejoined the father — and it showed how sound the old Scotchman was — ‘ if he gets grace , we 'll make a minister o ’ him ! ’ ‘ Oh , but , ’ says Mr. Linton , ‘ if he does not get grace , what will you make of him then ? ’ ‘ Weel , in that case , ’ said the parent , ‘ if he disna get grace , we 'll just mak ’ a dominie o ’ him !

   <p>Dr. Guthrie to his Son : “ I saw an adage yesterday , in a medical magazine , which is well worth your remembering and acting on , it is this wise saying of the great Lord Bacon 's :— ‘ Who asks much learns much . ’ I remember the day when I did not like by asking , to confess my ignorance . I have long given up that , and now seize on every opportunity of adding to my stock of knowledge . ”</p>

    <head>INNOCENCE AND GUILT .</head>
    <head>A painter , desiring to paint a picture of Innocence , found a beautiful boy playing at the side of a stream , who became his model . He painted him kneeling , with his hands clasped in prayer . The picture was prized as a very beautiful one . Years passed away , and the artist became an old man . He had often thought of painting a counterpart , the picture of guilt , as a companion to the other ; and at last he executed it . He went to a neighboring prison , and there selected the most degraded and repulsive man he could find . His body and eye were wasted ; vice was visible in his very face . But what was the artist 's surprise when , on questioning the man as to his history , he found that it was he who , as a lovely boy , had kneeled for him as the model of Innocence ! Evil habits had gradually changed him , not only in heart and mind , but in face and form .</head>

    <head>ELOQUENCE OF THE HANDS .</head>
    <head>The hands are , by the very instincts of humanity , raised in prayer ; clasped in affection ; wrung in despair ; pressed on the forehead when the soul is “ perplexed in the extreme ; ” drawn inward , to invite ; thrust forth objectively , to repel ; the fingers point to indicate , and are snapped in disdain ; the palm is laid upon the heart , in invocation of subdued feeling , and on the brow of the compassioned in benediction . The expressive capacity of the hands was never more strikingly displayed than in the orisons ( prayer ) of the deaf and dumb . Their teacher stood with closed eyes , and addressing the Deity by those signs made with the fingers which constitute a language for the speechless . Around him were grouped more than a hundred mutes , following with reverent glances every motion . It was a visible , but not an audible , worship .</head>

    <head>THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HAND .</head>
    <head>A dispute arose among three ladies as to which had the most beautiful hands . One sat by a stream , and dipped her hand into the water and held it up ; another plucked strawberries until the ends of her fingers were pink ; and a third gathered violets until her hands were fragrant . An old , haggard woman , passing by , asked , “ Who will give me a gift , for I am poor ? ” all three denied her ; but another who sat near , unwashed in the stream , unstained with fruit , unadorned with flowers or perfume , gave her a little gift , and satisfied the poor woman . Then the woman asked them what was the subject of their dispute ; and they told her , and lifted up before her their beautiful hands . “ Beautiful indeed ! ” she exclaimed , as she saw them . But when they asked her which was the most beautiful , she said : “ It is not the hand that is washed clean in the brook ; it is not the hand that is coloured with crimson tints ; it is not the hand that is perfumed with fragrant flowers ; but the hand that gives to the poor , that is the most beautiful . ”</head>

    <head>A BROKEN HEART .</head>
    <head>Dr. Mitchell of Philadelphia , in lecturing to his pupils upon the diseases of the heart , narrated an anecdote to prove that the expression “ broken heart ” was not merely figurative . On one occasion , in the early period of his life , he accompanied , as surgeon , a packet that sailed from Liverpool to one of the American ports . The captain frequently conversed with him respecting a lady who had promised to become his bride on his return from that voyage . Upon this subject he evinced great warmth of feeling , and showed Dr. Mitchell some costly jewels , ornaments , etc ., which he intended to present as bridal presents . On reaching his destination , he was abruptly informed that the lady had married some one else . Instantly the captain was observed to clap his hand to his breast , and fall heavily to the ground . He was taken up , and conveyed to his cabin on board the vessel . Dr. Mitchell was immediately summoned ; but , before he reached the poor captain , he was dead . A postmortem examination revealed the cause of his unfortunate disease . His heart was found literally torn in twain ! The tremendous propulsion of blood , consequent upon such a violent nervous shock , forced the powerful muscle tissues asunder , and life was at an end . The heart was broken .</head>

    <head>When I was a young man , there lived in our neighborhood one who was universally reported to be a very liberal man , and uncommonly upright in his dealings . When he had any of the produce of his farm to dispose of , he made it an invariable rule to give good measure , over good , rather more than could be required of him . One of his friends , observing him frequently doing so , questioned him why he did it , told him he gave too much , and said it would not be to his own advantage .

    <head>Can any one who was present ever forget the broken voice and streaming tears with which he ( Dean Stanley ) told the story of two little Scotch boys , Reuben and Sandy ? The story was as follows : “ On a cold winter day , a gentleman in Edinburgh had , out of pity , bought a box of matches from a poor , little , shivering boy , and , as he had no pence , had given him a shilling , of which the change was to be brought to his hotel . Hours passed by , and the boy did not return . Very late in the evening a mere child came to the hotel . ‘ Are you the gentleman that bought the matches frae Sandy ? ’ ‘ Yes . ’ ‘ Well , then , here 's fourpence out o ’ yer ’ shillin ’ ; Sandy canna come . He 's verra ill. A cart ran over him and knocked him doon , and he lost his bonnet and his matches and yer sevenpence , and baith his legs are broken , and the doctor says he 'll dee ; and that 's a ’ . ' And then , putting down the fourpence on the table , the poor child burst into great sobs . ‘ So I fed the little man , ’ said the narrator ; ‘ and I went with him to see Sandy . The two little things were living almost alone ; their father and mother were dead . Poor Sandy was lying on a bundle of shavings . He knew me as soon as I came in , and said , ‘ I got the change , sir , and was coming back , and then the cart knocked me down , and both my legs were broken ; and oh , Reuby , little Reuby , I am sure I am dying , and who will take care of you when I am gone ? What will ye do ? ’ ‘ I took his hand , and said I would always take care of Reuby .

    <head>JUDICIAL HONOR .</head>
    <head>A poor man claimed a house which a rich man had seized . The former produced his deeds and instruments to prove his right , but the latter had provided a number of witnesses ; and , to support their evidence the more effectually , he secretly presented the cadi with a bag containing five hundred ducats , which the cadi received . When it came to a hearing , the poor man told his story and produced his writings , but lacked witnesses . The other , provided with witnesses , laid his whole stress on them and on his adversary 's defective law , who could produce none ; he , therefore , urged the cadi to give sentence in his favor . After the most pressing solicitations , the judge calmly drew from beneath his sofa the bag of five hundred ducats , which the rich man had given him as a bribe , saying to him very gravely , “ You have been much mistaken in the suit ; for if the poor man could produce no witnesses in confirmation of his right , I , myself , can furnish him with at least five hundred . ” He threw him the bag with reproach and indignation and decreed the house to the poor plaintiff .</head>

   <p>A Scottish youth learned , with a pious mother , to sing the old psalms that were then as household words to them in the kirk ( church ) and by the fireside . When he had grown up he wandered away from his native country , was taken captive by the Turks , and made a slave in one of the Barbary States . But he never forgot the songs of Zion , although he sang them in a strange land and to heathen ears .</p>
   <p>One night he was solacing himself in this manner when the attention of some sailors on board of a British man-of-war was directed to the familiar tune of “ Old Hundred ” as it came floating over the moonlit waves .</p>
   <p>At once they surmised the truth that one of their countrymen was languishing away his life as a captive . Quickly arming themselves , they manned a boat and lost no time in effecting his release . What joy to him after eighteen long years passed in slavery ! Is it strange that he ever afterwards cherished the glorious tune of “ Old Hundred ? ”</p>

    <head>POLITICAL INTEGRITY .</head>
    <head>The borough of Hull , in the reign of Charles II , chose Andrew Marvell , a young gentleman of little or no fortune , and maintained him in London for the service of the public . With a view to bribe him , his old school-fellow , the Lord Treasurer Danby , went to him in his garret . At parting , the Lord Treasurer slipped into his hands an order upon the treasury for £ 1000 , and then went into his chariot . Marvell looking at the paper , called after the treasurer — “ My lord , I request another moment . ” They went up again to the garret , and the servant boy was called — “ What had I for dinner yesterday ? ” “ Do n't you remember , sir , you had the little shoulder of mutton that you ordered me to bring from a woman in the market ? ” “ Very right . What have I for dinner today ? ” “ Do n't you know , sir , that you made me lay up the blade-bone to broil ? ” “ ‘ Tis so ; very right . Go away . ” “ My lord , do you hear that ? Andrew Marvell 's dinner is provided ; there 's your piece of paper , I want it not . I knew the sort of kindness you intended . I live here to serve my constituents .

   <p>Johnson : “ It is commonly a weak man who marries for love . ” We then talked of marrying women of fortune ; and I ( Boswell ) mentioned a common remark , that a man may be , upon the whole , richer by marrying a woman with a very small portion , because a woman of fortune will be proportionally expensive ; whereas a woman who brings none will be very moderate in expenses . Johnson : “ Depend upon it , Sir , this is not true . A woman of fortune , being used to the handling of money , spends it judiciously ; but a woman who gets the command of money for the first time upon her marriage , has such a gust in spending it , that she throws it away with great profusion . ”</p>

One of the first peers of England went once to his chamber and told him — “ That having a suit in law to be tried before him , he was there to acquaint him with it , that he might the better understand it when he should come to be heard in court . ” Upon which Sir Matthew interrupted him , and said — “ He did not deal fairly to come to his chamber about such affairs , for he never received any information of causes but in open court , where both parties were to be heard alike , ” so he would not suffer him to go on . Whereupon his grace ( for he was a Duke ) went away not a little dissatisfied , and complained of it to the king , as a rudeness that was not to be endured . But his majesty bade him content himself that he was no worse used , and said — “ He verily believed he would have used himself no better , if he had gone to solicit him in any of his own causes . ”</head>

   <p>I send you herewith a bill for ten louis d'ors . I do not pretend to give such a sum . I only lend it to you . When you shall return to your country you cannot fail of getting into some business that will in time enable you to pay all your debts . In that case , when you meet with another honest man in similar distress you must pay me by lending this sum to him , enjoining him to discharge the debt by a like operation when he shall be able , and shall meet with such another opportunity . I hope it may thus go through many hands before it meets with a knave to stop its progress . This is a trick of mine for doing a deal of good with a little money . I am not rich enough to afford much in good works , and so am obliged to be cunning and make the most of a little .</p>

    <head>GRATITUDE OF AN INDIAN CHIEF .</head>
    <head>A Scotch Highlander was taken prisoner by a tribe of Indians ; his life was about to be sacrificed , when the chief adopted him as his son . They carried him into the interior ; he learnt their language , assumed their habits , and became skillful in the use of their arms . After a season the same tribe began their route to join the French army , at that time opposed to the British . It was necessary to pass near to the British lines during the night . Very early in the morning , and it was spring , the old chief roused the young Highlander from his repose : he took him to an eminence , and pointed out to him the tents of his countrymen . The old man appeared to be dreadfully agitated , and there was a keen restlessness in his eye . After a pause — “ I lost , ” said he , “ my only son in a battle with your nation ; are you the only son of your father ? And do you think that your father is yet alive ? ” The young man replied , “ I am the only son of my father , and I hope that my father is yet alive . ” They stood close to a beautiful magnolia in full blossom . The prospect was grand and enchanting , and all its charms were crowned by the sun , which had fully emerged from the horizon . The old chief , looking steadfastly at his companion , exclaimed : “ Let thy heart rejoice at the beauty of the scene ! To me it is as the desert ; but you are free ; return to your countrymen , revisit your father that he may again rejoice when he sees the sun rise in the morning , and the trees blossom in the spring ! ”</head>

   <p>Returned Kindness .— When the country near Albany was newly settled , an Indian came to the inn at Lichfield , and asked for a night 's shelter , at the same time confessing that from failure in hunting he had nothing to pay . The hostess drove him away with reproachful epithets , and as the Indian was retiring sorrowfully ,— there being no other inn for many a weary mile ,— a man who was sitting by directed the hostess to supply his wants , and promised to pay her . As soon as his supper was ended , the Indian thanked his benefactor , and said he would some day repay him . Several years thereafter the settler was taken a prisoner by a hostile tribe , and carried off to Canada . However , his life was spared , though he himself was detained in slavery . But one day an Indian came to him , and giving him a musket , bade the captive follow him . The Indian never told where they were going , nor what was his object ; but day after day the captive followed his mysterious guide , till one afternoon they came suddenly on a beautiful expanse of cultivated fields , with many houses rising amongst them . “ Do you know that place ? ” asked the Indian . “ Ah , yes — it is Lichfield ! ” and whilst the astonished exile had not recovered his surprise and amazement , the Indian exclaimed — “ And I am the starving Indian on whom at this very place you took pity . And now that I have paid for my supper , I pray you go home ! ”</p>

   <p>Men may acquire knowledge , but not wisdom . Some of the greatest fools the world has known have been learned men .</p>
   <p>1058</p>
   <p>I have never yet found a man who did not know something of which I was ignorant .</p>

   <p>If we do not plant it ( knowledge ) when young , it will give us no shade when we are old .</p>

    <head>SCOTCH STUDENT AS LAMPLIGHTER .</head>
    <head>Many hardships endured by students attending university or college in Scotland have been brought to light from time to time . A student of Anderson 's Medical College some years ago fulfilled the duties of lamplighter during his spare hours in a neighboring burgh . He had no other income than the few shillings he received weekly for lighting , extinguishing and cleaning the burgh lamps , and from this he paid his college fees and kept himself fairly respectable . On one occasion he applied for an increase of wages , and was called before the committee . One of the bailies remarked that an able-bodied healthy-looking young man like the applicant , might find some other employment instead of wasting his time as he was doing . The application for an increase was refused . One may conceive the bailie 's surprise at a subsequent meeting when the town clerk read a letter from the lamplighter , tendering his resignation , as he had passed his final examination as a fully qualified doctor .</head>

    <head>ORIGIN OF LANGUAGE .</head>
    <head>Talking of the origin of language ,— Johnson : “ It must have come by inspiration . A thousand , nay , a million of children could not invent a language . While the organs are pliable , there is not understanding enough to form a language ; by the time that there is understanding enough , the organs are become stiff . We know that after a certain age we cannot learn to pronounce a new language . No foreigner who comes to England when advanced in life , ever pronounces English tolerably well ; at least such instances are very rare . When I maintain that language must have come by inspiration , I do not mean that inspiration is required for rhetoric , and all the beauties of language ; for when once man has language , we can conceive that he may gradually form modifications of it . I mean only that inspiration seems to me to be necessary to give man the faculty of speech ; to inform him that he may have speech ; which I think he could no more find out without inspiration than cows or hogs would think of such a faculty . ”</head>

   <p>GENERAL LEE 'S REPLY .</p>
   <p>After the Civil War many offers of places of honor and fame came to General Robert E. Lee . He refused them all , says Thomas Nelson Page , in his biography of the soldier . The only position which he finally did accept , was the presidency of Washington College ,— now Washington and Lee University , at Lexington , Virginia , with a small salary .</p>
   <p>On one of these occasions , Lee was approached with the tender of the presidency of an insurance company , at a salary of fifty thousand dollars a year . He declined it , saying that it was work with which he was not familiar .</p>
   <p>“ But , general , ” said the representative of the insurance company , “ you will not be expected to do any work . What we wish , is the use of your name . ”</p>
   <p>“ Do you not think , ” said General Lee , “ that if my name is worth fifty thousand dollars a year , I ought to be very careful about taking care of it ? ”</p>
   <p>1104</p>
   <p>Colonel Chesney , of the British Army , said of R. E. Lee : “ The day will come when the evil passions of the great civil war will sleep in oblivion , and the North and South do justice to each other 's motives , and forget each other 's wrongs . Then history will speak with clear voice of the deeds done on either side , and the citizens of the whole Union do justice to the memories of the dead , and place above all others the name of the great Southern chief . In strategy , mighty ; in battle , terrible ; in adversity , as in prosperity , a hero indeed ; with the simple devotion to duty and the rare purity of the ideal Christian Knight ,— he joined all the kingly qualities of a leader of men . It is a wondrous future indeed that lies before America ; but in her annals of the years to come , as in those of the past , there will be found few names that can rival in unsullied lustre that of the heroic defender of his native Virginia ,— Robert Edward Lee . ”</p>

    <head>NOT A CANDIDATE .</head>
    <head>The following well-merited rebuke by a slave to his master , shows that persons occupying mean positions in this life are sometimes superior to those above them .</head>
    <head>A gentleman in the enjoyment of wealth , and of high social standing , and wholly given up to the pleasures of this world , knowing that one of his slaves was religious , and happening to see him in the garden near the porch of his house , called him up rather to amuse himself than for any serious purpose . When the slave came to him , cap in hand , he said , “ Tom , what do you think of me ; do you believe I will be one of the elect when I die ? ”</head>
     <l n="1">With a low obeisance , the slave replied : “ Master , I never knew any one</l>
     <l n="2">to be elected who was not a candidate . ”</l>

   <p>Where there is love , all things interest ; where there is indifference , minute details are tedious , disbelief is cherished , and trifles are apt to be thought contemptible .</p>

   <p>If he loves me , the merit is not mine ; my fault will be if he ceases .</p>
   <p>1163</p>
   <p>LOVE .</p>
   <p>To a man , the disappointment of love may occasion some bitter pangs : it wounds some feelings of tenderness — it blasts some prospects of felicity ; but he is an active being ; he may dissipate his thoughts in the whirl of varied occupation , or may plunge into the tide of pleasure ; or , if the scene of disappointment be too full of painful associations , he can shift his abode at will , and taking , as it were , the wings of the morning , can “ fly to the uttermost parts of the earth , and be at rest . ”</p>
   <p>But woman 's is comparatively a fixed , a secluded and a meditative life . She is more the companion of her own thoughts and feelings ; and if they are turned to ministers of sorrow , where shall she look for consolation ? Her lot is to be wooed and won ; and if unhappy in her love , her heart is her world — is like some fortress that has been captured , and sacked , and abandoned , and left desolate .</p>
   <p>Shall I confess it ?— I believe in broken hearts , and the possibility of dying of disappointed love ! I do not , however , consider it a malady often fatal to my own sex ; but I firmly believe that it withers down many a lovely woman into an early grave . So is it the nature of woman to hide from the world the pangs of wounded affection .</p>

    <head>“ My dear Veit , ” said Luther , “ I have said it often and I repeat it again , whoever would know God aright and speculate concerning Him without danger , must look into the manger , and learn first of all to know the Son of the Virgin Mary , born at Bethlehem , lying in His mother 's bosom or hanging upon the cross ; then will he understand who God is . This will not only then be not terrible , but on the contrary most attractive and comforting . Guard yourself , my dear Veit , from the proud thought of climbing into heaven without this ladder , apart from the Lord Jesus Christ in His humanity . As the Word simple describes Him , stick to this , and do not permit reason to divert you from it ; then will you apprehend God aright ! I wish to know of no other God than the God who hung upon the cross , Jesus Christ , the Son of God , and of the Virgin Mary . ”</head>

   <p>Luther was remarkable for his contempt of riches , though few men had a greater opportunity of obtaining them . The Elector of Saxony offered him the produce of a mine at Sneberg , but he nobly refused it , lest it should prove an injury to him .</p>

   <p>LUXURY .</p>
   <p>Dr. Johnson :— “ A man gives half a guinea for a dish of green peas . How much gardening does this occasion ? How many laborers must the competition , to have such things early in the market , keep in employment ? You will hear it said very gravely , ‘ Why was not the half-guinea , thus spent in luxury , given to the poor ? To how many might it have afforded a good meal ? Alas ! has it not gone to the industrious poor , whom it is better to support , than the idle poor ? You are much surer that you are doing good when you pay money to those who work , as the recompense of their labor , than when you give money merely in charity . ”</p>

    <head>MAN .</head>
    <head>Man has been thrown naked into the world , feeble , incapable of flying like the bird , running like the stag , or creeping like the serpent ; without means of defense , in the midst of terrible enemies armed with claws and stings ; without means to brave the inclemency of the seasons , in the midst of animals protected by fleece , by scales , by furs ; without shelter , when all others have their den , their hole , their shell ; without arms , when all about him are armed against him . And yet he has demanded of the lion his cave for a lodging and the lion retires before his eyes ; he has despoiled the bear of his skin , and of it made his first clothing ; he has plucked the horn from the bull , and this is his first drinking-cup ; then he has dug even into the bowels of the earth , to seek there the instruments of his future strength ; from a rib , a sinew , and a reed , he has made arms ; and the eagle , who , seeing him at first in his weakness and nakedness , prepares to seize him as his prey , struck in mid-air , falls dead at his feet , only to furnish a feather to adorn his head . Among animals , is there one , who under such conditions could have preserved life ? Let us for a moment separate the workman from his work , God from nature . Nature has done all for this insect ,— of which they had been discoursing ,— nothing for man . It is that man should be the product of intelligence rather than of matter ; and God , in granting him this celestial gift , this ray of light from the divine fire , created him feeble and unprotected , that he might make use of it , that he might be constrained to find in himself the elements of his greatness .</head>

   <p>The question is asked concerning the property of every rich man who dies ; and it was answered very happily by Cloots , who was executor upon the estate of the late Mr. Snodgrass . His neighbor , Mr. Nailroad , was an exceedingly inquisitive man . The day after the funeral , Nailroad visited Cloots , and , with an inspecting face , began to question him . “ Mr. Cloots , ” says he , “ if it is not improper , will you inform me how much my particular friend Snodgrass left ? ” “ Certainly , ” said Cloots :— “ He left every cent he was worth in the world , and did n't take a copper with him . ”</p>

   <p>A Gentleman , but a Fool .— Chief Justice Marshall once found himself suddenly brought to a halt by a small tree which intervened between the front wheel and the body of his buggy . Seeing a servant at a short distance , he asked him to bring an axe and cut down the tree . The servant — a colored man — told the judge that there was no occasion for cutting down the tree , but just to back the buggy . Pleased at the good sense of the fellow , Judge Marshall told him that he would leave him something at the inn hard by , where he intended to stop , having then no small change . In due time the man applied , and a dollar was handed him . Being asked if he knew who it was that gave him the dollar , he replied : “ No , sir : I concluded he was a gentleman by his leaving the money , but I think he is the biggest fool I ever saw . ”</p>

   <p>Numbers , xxxvi . 6 ,— “ Let them marry to whom they think best ; only to the family of the tribe of their fathers shall they marry . ”</p>
   <p>Mr. John Martin used to give two advices , both to his children and others , in reference to marriages . One was , “ Keep within the bounds of your profession . ” The other was , “ Look at suitableness in age , quality , education , temper , etc . ” He used to observe , from Genesis , ii , 18 , “ I will make him a help-meet for him ; ” that there is not meetness , there will not be much help . He commonly said to his children , with reference to their choice in marriage , “ Please God , and please yourselves , and you shall never displease me ; ” and greatly blamed those parents who conclude matches for their children without their consent . He sometimes mentioned the saying of a pious gentlewoman , who had many daughters .— “ The care of most people is how to get good husbands for their daughters ; but my care is to fit my daughters to be good wives , and then let God provide for them . ”</p>

   <p>The Clemency of a Queen .— It is related that during the first few days of the reign of Queen Victoria , then a girl between nineteen and twenty years of age , some sentences of a court-martial were presented for her signature . One was death for desertion . She read it , paused , and looked up to the officer who laid it before her , and said :— “ Have you nothing to say in behalf of this man ? ” “ Nothing ; he has deserted three times , ” answered the officer . “ Think again , Your Grace , ” was the reply . “ And , ” said the gallant veteran , as he related the circumstance to his friends — ( for he was none other than the Duke of Wellington ) — “ seeing her majesty so earnest about it , I said — ‘ He is certainly a bad soldier , but there was somebody who spoke as to his good character , and he may be a good man for aught I know to the contrary . ’ ” “ Oh , I thank you a thousand times ! ” exclaimed the youthful queen , and hastily writing ‘ Pardoned ’ in large letters on the fatal page , she sent it across the table with a hand trembling with eagerness and beautiful emotion .</p>

   <p>WHILE MOTHER WAS AWAY .</p>
   <p>The Princess of Wales has trained her children so carefully in habits of obedience and veracity that they are most trustworthy little persons . Before her royal highness started on her trip round the world with her husband , she drew up a list of rules to be observed in the nursery , and added a series of light tasks to be fullfilled by each one of the youngsters before the date set for her return .</p>
   <p>The rules were to be enforced by the nurses . The performance of the tasks was left to the honor of the children , and in addition there was a list of things they must not do .</p>
   <p>There were occasional lapses of memory as regards the forbidden things , and some carelessness in carrying out the tasks , for royal children , despite the severity of their training , are children still . But in the main they respected their mother 's wishes and commands , and took no advantage of her absence . Upon one occasion , however , they were sorely tempted . This was when their loving and beloved grandmother , Queen Alexandria , brought them a big box of bonbons . But when the sweets were offered to them , one child after another reluctantly but firmly declined to take any .</p>
   <p>“ We like them , but mother has forbidden us to eat them , ” explained the eldest prince .</p>
   <p>“ You can have the sugar-plums if I say you may , ” said the indulgent queen . “ I will tell mama all about it when she returns . ”</p>
   <p>Prince Eddie wavered momentarily , then reiterated his refusal .</p>
   <p>“ We 'd like them , ” he sighed , “ but that 's what mother said . ”</p>
   <p>The queen was slightly annoyed by this opposition .</p>
   <p>“ But if I say you may — ” she said .</p>
   <p>Prince Eddie stood his ground , a hero between two fires — the wishes of his adored mother , and those of his almost equally adored grandmother . His sister and his brothers followed his lead . When the queen went away she put the bonbons on the nursery table and there they stayed for months untouched , a handsome monument to the thoroughness of the princess ’ training and the respectful love and devotion of her children .</p>

    <head>THE DARING OF A MOTHER .</head>
    <head>In Scotland a peasant woman had a child a few weeks old , which was seized by one of the golden eagles , the largest in the country , and borne away in its talons to its lofty eyrie on one of the most inaccessible cliffs of Scotland 's bleak hills ; the mother , perceiving her loss , hurried in alarm to its rescue , and the peasantry among whom the alarm spread , rushed out to her aid ; they all came to the foot of the tremendous precipice ; the peasants were anxious to risk their lives in order to recover the little infant ; but how was the crag to be reached ? One peasant tried to climb , but was obliged to return ; another tried and came down injured ; a third tried , and one after another failed , till a universal feeling of despair and deep sorrow fell upon the crowd as they gazed upon the eyrie where the infant lay . At last a woman was seen , climbing first one part and then another , getting over one rock and then another , and while every heart trembled with alarm , to the amazement of all , they saw her reach the loftiest crag , and clasp the infant rejoicingly in her bosom . This heroic female began to descend the perilous steep with her child ; moving from point to point ; and while everyone thought that her next step would precipitate her and dash her to pieces , they saw her at length reach the ground with the child safe in her arms . Who was this female ? Why did she succeed when others failed ? It was The Mother of The Child .</head>

   <p>A MOTHER 'S LOVE .</p>
   <p>Children , look in those eyes , listen to that dear voice , notice the feeling of even a single touch that is bestowed upon you by that gentle hand . Make much of it while yet you have that most precious of all good gifts , a loving mother . Read the unfathomable love of those eyes ; the kind anxiety of that tone and look , however slight your pain .</p>
   <p>In after-life you may have friends , fond , dear , kind friends ; but never will you have again the inexpressible love and gentleness lavished upon you which none but a mother bestows . Often do I sigh in my struggles with hard , uncaring world , for the sweet , deep security I felt when , of an evening nestling in her bosom , I listened to some quiet tale , suitable to my age , read in her tender and untiring voice . Never can I forget her sweet glances cast upon me when I appeared asleep , never her kiss of peace at night . Years have passed away since we laid her beside my father in the old church yard ; yet still her voice whispers from the grave , and her eye watches over me , as I visit spots long since hallowed to the memory of my mother .</p>

   <p>Each mother is a historian ; she writes not the history of empires or of nations on paper , but she writes her own history on the imperishable mind of her child . That tablet and that history will remain indelible when time shall be no more . That history each mother shall meet again , and read , with eternal joy , or unutterable grief , in the coming ages of eternity .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>“ When I lived among the Choctaw Indians , I held a consultation with one of their chiefs respecting the successive stages of their progress in the arts of civilized life ; and among other things he informed me , that at their start they made a great mistake ,— they only sent boys to school . These boys came home intelligent men ; but they married uneducated and uncivilized wives , and the uniform result was , the children were all like their mothers . The father soon lost all his interest both in wife and children . ‘ And now , ’ said he ‘ if we would educate but one class of our children , we should choose the girls ; for , when they become mothers , they educate their sons . ’ ”</p>

   <p>Did n't Know the Place .— A young man who left his native city to study medicine in Paris , and had been applying his time and the paternal remittances to very different purposes , received a visit from his father , who intended making a short stay in the capital to inspect its wonders . During an afternoon stroll together , the day after the elder 's arrival , the father and son happened to pass in front of a large colonnaded building . “ What is that ? ” said the senior , carelessly . “ I do n't know , but we 'll inquire , ” answered the student . On the query being put to an official , he shortly replied : “ That ? It is the School of Medicine . ”</p>

   <p>SCOTTISH PERSEVERANCE .</p>
   <p>Scottish perseverance has itself become proverbial ; we remember to have met with a story which is said to be connected with the foundation of an opulent mercantile house which has flourished for some generations . Saunders , the traveler , entered a shop in London and enquired for the head of the house ; one of the clerks asked what he wanted ; the answer of Saunders was , as usual , a question , “ Want ye aught in my line , sir ? ” “ No , ” was the prompt reply , accompanied by a look of contempt at the itinerant Scotch merchant . “ Will ye no tak ’ a look o ’ the gudes , sir ? ” was Saunders ’ next query . “ No , not at all ; I have not time . Take them away — take them away ! ” “ Ye 'll aiblins ( perhaps ) find them worth your while , and I doubt na but ye 'll buy , ” said Saunders ; and he proceeded to untie and unstrap his burden . “ Go away — go away ! ” was reiterated more than once by the clerk , but the persevering Scot still persisted . The master of the establishment overheard all that had taken place , and now he stepped forward , and , moved by some compunction for the treatment the traveler had received , and some admiration , too , for the patience and perseverance of the man , he consented to look over the contents of the pack , found them to be exactly the goods he was in want of , purchased them all , and gave a very large order ; and thus , says Chambers , who tells the story , assisted in the foundation of a large mercantile house .</p>
   <p>But is not this the stuff of which also the Livingstones and the Macleods are made ? Was not this the spirit which set the brave Sir Walter Scott to work , when sinking into his later years , to overtake his fearful loss of one hundred thousand pounds ? Is it not a commentary upon that especial proverb which we have said so illustrates the Scottish character , “ He that tholes ( or endures ) overcomes ? ”</p>

   <p>Jenny Lind was frequently known to pass unobserved from her residence , as if to make a visit , and had been traced to the back lanes and cottages of the poor , whose wants she ascertained and relieved . Several times she had been remonstrated with , and warned by her intimate friends against being imposed upon . She always replied , “ Never mind ; if I relieve ten , and one is worthy , I am satisfied . ”</p>

    <head>NAME OF THE GOOD SAMARITAN .</head>
    <head>A philanthropist , when a candidate for the ministry , was traveling on one occasion from Strasbourg . It was in the winter time . The ground was deeply covered with snow , and the roads were almost impassable . He had reached the middle of his journey and was among the mountains ; and by that time was so exhausted that he could stand erect no longer . He was rapidly freezing to death , and sleep began to overpower him . He commended himself to God , and yielded to what he felt to be the sleep of death . He knew not how long he slept , but suddenly became conscious of some one rousing him . Before him stood a wagon-driver in his blue blouse , and the wagon not far away . His rescuer gave him a little wine and food , and the spirit of life returned . He then helped him upon the wagon , and brought him to the next village . Oberlin , the philanthropist , was profuse in his thanks , and offered money , which his benefactor refused . “ It is only a duty to help one another , ” said the wagoner ; “ and it is the next thing to an insult to offer a reward for such a service . ” “ Then , ” said Oberlin , “ at least tell me your name , that I may have you in thankful remembrance before God . ” “ I see , ” said the wagoner , “ that you are a minister of the Gospel . Please tell me the name of the Good Samaritan . ” “ That , ” said Oberlin , “ I cannot do ; for it was not put on record . ” “ Then , ” replied the wagoner , “ until you can tell me his name , permit me to withhold mine . ”</head>

   <p>A Sensible Answer .— A story is told about Wendell Phillips — a story that must have made even the serious-minded Abolitionist laugh heartily : He was in a hotel in Charleston , had breakfast in his room , and was served by a slave . Mr. Phillips spoke to him as an Abolitionist , but the waiter seemed to be more concerned about the breakfast than about himself . Finally Mr. Phillips told him to go away , saying that he could not bear to be waited upon by a slave .</p>

    <head>TRUE POLITENESS .</head>
    <head>The following beautiful incident is related of the late Prince consort . On one occasion a humble but very worthy man who had befriended the Prince in early life called to see him , and was invited to come to the family table . He began to eat with his knife , as he had always been accustomed to do , and this excited a little quiet merriment among the young people . Prince Albert looked round upon them , as if to say , “ Stop that ! ” and at once began himself to eat with his knife , and continued to do so to the end of the meal . After dinner , one of the children asked him why he did so . The Prince replied : “ It is well enough for us to observe the etiquette of the day ; but it is far more important to avoid insulting people . I wanted my old friend to enjoy his dinner , which he could not have done had he seen you laughing at him . He is accustomed to use his knife , and it would doubtless be quite difficult for him to use the fork instead . ” — This was genuine politeness , and the world would be happier if the same feeling were always shown .</head>

   <p>ONE “ ALWAYS RIGHT ; ” THE OTHER , “ NEVER WRONG . ”</p>
   <p>A worthy old Ayrshire farmer had the portraits of himself and his wife painted . When that of her husband , in an elegant frame , was hung over the fireplace , the gudewife remarked in a sly manner : “ I think , gudeman , noo that ye 've gotten your picture hung up there , we should just put in below't , for a motto , like , ‘ Aye richt ! ’ ”</p>
   <p>“ Deed may ye , my woman , ” replied her husband in an equally pawkie tone ; “ and when ye get yours hung up over the sofa there , we 'll just put up anither motto o n't , and say , ‘ Never wrang . ’ ”</p>

   <p>DIRECTED IN A DREAM .</p>
   <p>A zealous divine , who had prayed earnestly that God would teach him the perfect way of truth , was directed in a dream to go to a certain place , where he would find an instructor ; when he came to the place , he found a man in ordinary attire , to whom he wished a good morning .</p>
   <p>“ I never had a bad morning , ” replied the man . “ That is very singular ; I wish you may always be as fortunate . ” “ I was never unfortunate , ” said he . “ I hope you may always be as happy , ” said the divine . “ I am never unhappy , ” said the other . “ I wish , ” said the divine , “ that you would explain yourself a little . ”</p>
   <p>“ That I will cheerfully do , ” said the other ; “ I said that I never had a bad morning , for every morning , even if I am pinched with hunger , I praise God . If it rains , or snows , or hails , whether the day is serene or tempestuous , I am still thankful to God , and therefore I never had a joyless morning . If I am miserable in outward circumstances , and despised , I still praise God ; you wished that I might always be fortunate , but I cannot be unfortunate , because nothing befalls me but according to the will of God , and I believe that His will is always good , in whatever He does or permits to be done . You wished me always happy , but I cannot be unhappy , because my will is always resigned to the will of God . ”</p>
   <p>The divine , astonished at the man 's answers , asked him whence he came .</p>
   <p>“ I came from God , ” he replied . “ Where did you find Him ? ” “ Where I left the world . ” “ Where did you leave God ? ” “ With the pure in heart . ” “ What are you ? ” “ I am a king . ” “ Where is your kingdom ? ” “ It is within my bosom . I have learned to rule my appetites and passions , and that is better than to rule any kingdom in the world . ”</p>
   <p>“ How were you brought into this happy condition ? ”</p>
   <p>“ By secret prayer , spiritual meditation and union with God ; nothing below God could satisfy my desires ; I have found Him , and in Him I have found Peace and Rest . ”</p>

That office is one angels themselves might covet . ”</p>

    <head>FULFILMENT OF A PROPHESY .</head>
    <head>The minuteness and accuracy of God 's program of the ages is often overlooked . There is a singular and striking instance of this in the triumphal entry of our Lord into Jerusalem . [ 1592 : A ] The command to go into the village nearby and bring the colt that would be found tied there , was in fulfillment of a prophesy made five hundred years before by Zachariah , 9th chapter , 9th verse :— “ Rejoice greatly , O daughter of Zion : shout O daughter of Jerusalem : behold , thy King cometh unto thee : He is just , and having salvation ; lowly , and riding upon an ass , and upon a colt the foal of an ass . ” — That same donkey colt was so essential to the transaction of that day , that the pageant could not have gone on without it .</head>

    <head>It is neither polite nor honest to be behind hand when one can just as easily be on time . An artist solicited and obtained permission to paint a portrait of Queen Victoria . The hour and place for the important undertaking were named . Promptly the queen was present ; but the artist was not when the hour came . He arrived at length , but too late , for her majesty had departed , leaving a message that she would not return . The queen had kept her promise , but the artist had failed to keep his , and thus lost the rare chance to win both fame and fortune .</head>

    <head>In Lanarkshire , there lived a sma ’ laird named Hamilton , who was noted for his eccentricity .

   <p>Profanity Gently Reproved .— It is related that the excellent John Wesley , having to travel some distance in a stagecoach , was thereby brought into the company of an intelligent and gentlemanly officer of the British army . The officer was very social with his traveling companions ; but the enjoyment , which his society would otherwise have afforded to those with him , was sadly lessened by the profane expressions he used .</p>
   <p>While stopping at a station , Mr. Wesley called the officer to one side , and , after expressing the satisfaction he had enjoyed in his company , told him he felt encouraged to ask of him a very great favor . “ I shall take great pleasure in obliging you , ” replied the officer , “ as I am certain you would not make an unreasonable request . ” — “ Then , ” said Mr. Wesley , “ as we are to travel together for some days , I beg that if I should so far forget myself as to use any profane language , you will kindly reprove me . ” The officer immediately perceived how faithfully and how delicately his own conduct stood reproved , and , smiling , said , “ No one but Mr. Wesley could administer reproof in such manner . ”</p>

    <head>RUSKIN MEETS SOME TOURISTS .</head>
    <head>“ I was fated the other day to come from Venice to Verona with a family — father and mother and two girls — it matters not what country they came from — presumably rich — girls fifteen and eighteen . I never before conceived the misery of people who had evidently spent all their lives in trying to gratify themselves . It was a little warm — warmer than was entirely luxurious — but nothing in the least harmful . They moaned and fidgeted and frowned and puffed and stretched and fanned , and ate lemons , and smelled bottles , and covered their faces , and tore the cover off again , and had not one thought or feeling during five hours of traveling in the most noble part of all the world except what four poor beasts would have had in their end of a menagerie , being dragged about on a hot day . Add to this misery every form of polite vulgarity , in methods of doing and saying the common things they said and did . I never yet saw humanity so degraded ( allowing for external circumstances of every possible advantage ) given wealth , attainable education and the inheritance of eighteen centuries of Christianity . ”</head>

   <p>Sir Thomas Sutton , the founder of the Charter House , was one of the wealthiest merchants of his day . Fuller tells how he was overheard one day praying in his garden : “ Lord , Thou hast given me a large and liberal estate ; give me also a heart to make use of it . ”</p>
   <p>1663</p>
   <p>The Influence of Riches .— A respectable widow lady , with a very small income , which she was obliged to eke out by the produce of her own industry and ingenuity , was remarkable for her generous liberality , especially in contributing to the cause of religion . When any work of pious benevolence was going forward , she was always ready to offer a donation equal to those of persons in comparative affluence . In process of time this lady came into the possession of an ample fortune , greatly to the joy of all who knew her willing liberality . But she no longer came forward unsolicited towards the cause of Christ , and when applied to , she yielded her aid but coldly and grudgingly , and sometimes excused herself from giving at all . On one occasion she presented a shilling to the same cause to which she had formerly given a guinea when in a state of comparative poverty . Her minister felt it his duty to expostulate with her , and reminded her of her former generosity when her means were so circumscribed . “ Ah ! sir , ” she affectingly replied ; “ then I had the shilling means , but the guinea heart , now I have the guinea means , but only the shilling heart . Then I received day by day my daily bread , and I had enough and to spare ; now , I have to look at my ample income , but I live in constant apprehension that I may come to want ! ”</p>
   <p>1664</p>
   <p>Riches and care are as inseparable as sun and shadow .</p>
   <p>1665</p>
   <p>As riches and favor forsake a man , we discover him to be below mediocrity , but nobody could find it out in his prosperity .</p>
   <p>1666</p>
   <p>I remember when Mr. Locke first came over from Italy . Old Dr. Moore , who had a high opinion of him , was crying up his drawings , and asked me if I did not think he would make a great painter ? I said , “ No , never ! ” “ Why not ? ” “ Because he has six thousand a year . ”</p>

    <head>Every one who rightly considers it , may know , that eminence and opulence in the world are not real divine blessings , notwithstanding man , from the pleasure he finds in them , calls them so ; for they pass away , and also seduce many , and turn them away from heaven ; but that eternal life , and its happiness , are real blessings , which are from the Divine : this the Lord also teaches in Luke : 12 ch ., 33-34 . “ Make to yourselves a treasure that faileth not in the heavens , where the thief cometh not , nor the moth corrupteth ; for where your treasure is , there will your heart be also . ”</head>

    <head>SALT .</head>
    <head>When Henry Drummond was traveling in tropical Africa , he found that salt was regarded by the natives as a rare luxury . Often he offered the native boys the choice between a pinch of salt and a lump of sugar , and they always chose the salt . Once he presented the head man of a village with a spoonful of salt . The chief twisted a leaf into a little bag , into which he poured the salt . Then he held out his hand to the children who crowded around , and each was allowed one lick of his empty palm .</head>

   <p>EARLY TRIALS OF DISTINGUISHED SCHOLARS .</p>
   <p>It is related of Dr. Adam , the celebrated rector of the High School of Edinburgh , that when at college he had to be content with a penny roll for his dinner . Similar , though more severe , were the early trials of Samuel Drew , also of Edinburgh . At the age of ten he was apprenticed to a shoemaker , a calling which he continued to follow long after he had become celebrated as an author . For days and days together in his early life he was too poor to spend even a penny for his dinner ; and he was accustomed , when dinner-time came , to tie his apron-string tighter to lessen the pang of hunger , and go on with his work till evening . Through years of hardship and drudgery his courage never forsook him ; amidst ceaseless labor he strove unremittingly to improve his mind , studying astronomy , history , and metaphysics ; and finally , from the humblest circumstances , he rose to occupy a conspicuous place as an author , a philosopher , and a metaphysician .</p>
   <p>The life of Balzac too , the French author , whose brilliant abilities won for him at last such wealth , fame and influence in France , is a type of many a literary career . At the age of twenty his wealthy parents wished to make him a notary . He announced his determination to become an author . “ But ” urged the father , “ do you not know to what state the occupation of a writer will lead you ? In literature a man must be either king or a hodman . ” “ Very well , ” replied Balzac , “ I will be king ! ” The family left town ; the youth was left to his fate in a garret , with the magnificent allowance of twenty-five francs a month . The first ten years he fought with poverty and all its evils ; the second decade made him his own master . These ten years , says a writer in a British magazine , were years of glory , wealth , and luxury . He had won the literary crown , as in youth he predicted . His later residences were palaces , richly decorated , and full of rare pictures , statuary , and valuable curiosities .</p>

   <p>CONCEIT OF SELF REBUKED .</p>
   <p>“ When I was younger than I am now , ” says a lawyer who is still somewhat this side of middle age , “ I had a position in the office of a man who has a big reputation . Naturally , I felt my responsibility . It was plain to me that the head of the firm had outlived his usefulness , and I used to feel sorry to think what would happen to him if I ever left him . Sheer magnanimity made me overlook a lot of things .</p>
   <p>“ I was n't treated in that office with all the deference due me , but I stood it till one day somebody went too far . Then I marched into the old gentleman 's private office and laid down the law to him . I told him I was n't going to endure such treatment another day . I was going to quit , that was what I was going to do , and I was going to quit right then and there . I unburdened my mind freely , and then I stopped to give him a chance to apologize and beg me not to ruin him by leaving . He did n't look up from his desk . He said to me in a polite kind of way , ‘ Please do n't slam the door when you go out . ’ ”</p>

    <head>The Rev . John Brown , of Haddington , rose from a poor shepherd boy to become a distinguished minister , and afterwards a celebrated professor , author of the “ Self-Interpreting Bible , ” and many other works . Robert Turnbull said of him in one of his books :— “ When a poor shepherd boy , he conceived the idea of learning Latin and Greek , and having procured a few old books , actually accomplished the task , while tending his cattle on the hills . So successful was he that some of the old and superstitious people in the neighborhood concluded that he must have been assisted by ‘ the evil spirit . ’ On one occasion he went to Edinburgh , plaided and barefoot , walked into a bookseller 's shop , and asked for a Greek Testament . ‘ What are you going to do with a Greek Testament ? ’ said the bookseller . ‘ Read it , ’ was the prompt reply . ‘ Read it ! ’ exclaimed the sceptical bookseller with a smile ; ‘ ye may have it for nothing if ye 'll read it . ’ Taking the book , he quietly read off a few verses , and gave the translation ; on which he was permitted to carry off the Greek Testament in triumph . ”</head>

    <head>A HAPPY USE OF SINGING .</head>
    <head>An excellent clergyman , possessing much knowledge of human nature , instructed his large family of daughters in the theory and practice of music . They were all observed to be exceedingly amiable and happy . A friend inquired if there was any secret in his mode of education . He replied — “ When anything disturbs their temper , I say to them sing , and if I hear them speaking against any person , I call them to sing to me ; and so they have sung away all causes of discontent , and every disposition to scandal . ”</head>

    <head>SLANDER AND EVIL SPEAKING .</head>
    <head>A lady who had been in the habit of spreading slanderous reports once confessed her fault to St. Philip Neri , who lived several hundred years ago . She asked him how she could cure it . “ Go , ” he said in reply , “ to the nearest market-place , buy a chicken just killed , pluck its feathers all the way , and come back to me . ” She was greatly surprised , wondering in what way a dead chicken could help her overcome her evil habit ; but she did as he bade her , and came back to him with the plucked chicken in her hand . “ Now go back , ” he said , “ and bring me all the feathers you have scattered . ” “ But this is impossible , ” she replied : “ I cast the feathers carelessly , and the wind carried them away ; how can I recover them ? ” “ That , ” he said , “ is exactly like your words of slander . They have been carried about in every direction . You cannot recall them . Go and slander no more . ” It was a striking way of teaching a very important lesson .</head>

    <head>BRIEF PULSATIONS OF JOY .</head>
    <head>The little that I have seen in the world , and known of the history of mankind , teaches me to look upon their errors in sorrow , not in anger . When I take the history of one poor heart that has sinned and suffered , and represent to myself the struggles and temptations it passed through , the brief pulsations of joy , the tears of regret , the feebleness of purpose , the scorn of the world that has little charity , the desolation of the soul 's sanctuary , and threatening voices within , health gone , happiness gone ,— I would fain leave the erring soul of my fellow-man with Him from whose hands it came .</head>

    <head>STORY OF A STANZA .</head>
    <head>Many years ago Dr. Valpy , a well known English scholar , wrote a little verse of four lines as the longing of his heart and the confession of his faith . This was the simple stanza :—</head>
     <l n="1">“ In peace let me resign my breath ,</l>
     <l n="2">And Thy salvation see ;</l>
     <l n="3">My sins deserve eternal death ,</l>
     <l n="4">But Jesus died for me . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Some time afterwards he gave this verse to his friend Dr. Marsh , and it became a great blessing to him . Dr. Marsh read the lines to his friend Lord Roden , who was so impressed with them that he got the doctor to write them out , and then fastened the paper over the mantlepiece in his study , and there , yellow with age , they hung for many years .</p>

   <p>M. Dumas , a French writer of plays , wrote : “ Never take your daughter to the theatre ; it is not merely the work that is immoral , it is the place . ”</p>
   <p>W. C. Macready , the great actor , said : “ None of my children shall ever , with my consent , enter a theatre , or have any visiting connection with actors or actresses . ”</p>
   <p>Edwin Booth , the great tragedian , wrote : “ My knowledge of the modern theatre is so very meagre that I never permit my wife or daughter to witness a play without previously ascertaining its character . The theatre is permitted to be a mere shop for gain , open to every huckster of immoral adventures ,— jimcracks . ”</p>
   <p>Fanny Kemble , the actress , confessed that life on the stage was unhealthy to morals , and said : “ I never presented myself before an audience without a shirking feeling of reluctance , or without thinking the excitement I had undergone unhealthy , and the personal exhibition odious . ”</p>
   <p>— Southern Churchman .</p>

   <p>An ounce of practice is worth a ton of theory .</p>

   <p>Do little things now ; so shall big things come to thee by and by asking to be done .</p>

   <p>1905</p>
   <p>Do n't despise a slight wound , or a poor relative .</p>
   <p>1906</p>
   <p>Never despise small things , for we were all infants before we became men , and pupils , ere we became teachers .</p>
   <p>1907</p>
   <p>Thought .— How often must we repeat it ?— rules the world .</p>
   <p>— Carlyle .</p>
   <p>1908</p>
   <p>At a dinner when Daniel Webster was Secretary of State , after a period of silence which fell upon the company of some twenty gentlemen who were present , one of the guests said , “ Mr. Webster , will you tell us what was the most important thought that ever occupied your mind ? ” Webster slowly passed his hand over his forehead , and in a low tone enquired of one near him , “ Is there any one here who does not know me ? ” “ No ; all are your friends . ” “ The most important thought that ever occupied my mind , ” said Webster , “ was that of my individual responsibility to God . ” And after speaking on this subject in the most solemn strain for fully ten minutes , he silently rose from the table and retired to his room . This incident serves to illustrate the attitude of great minds towards eternal things . Great men are not scoffers . The men of flippant jeers and godless jests are invariably men of small calibre and shallow intellect .</p>

    <head>Such was the spirit of a venerable [ 1913 : A ] patriarch — who shed on a very humble station the lustre of brilliant graces — that , when the storm sent others in haste to their homes , he was wont to leave his own , and to stand with upturned face , raised eye , and with his grey head uncovered , to watch the flash and listen to the music of the roaring thunder . How fine his reply to those who expressed their wonder at his aspect and attitude — “ It 's my Father 's voice , and I like well to hear it ! ” What a sublime example of the perfect love that casteth out fear ?</head>

    <head>ONE WAY OF ACQUIRING A TITLE .</head>
    <head>“ From time immemorial , ” said Judge Asher Carruth , of London , “ Southern people have been lavish in bestowing titles . I think there is something in the Southern temperament which explains this . I did n't start out on this , however , for a philosophical disquisition , but rather to tell how a certain Kentucky gentleman established valid title to the rank of Colonel . He went to Cincinnati once with a friend , who enjoyed many acquaintances there ; and who introduced him to every one as Colonel Brown . Everything went along smoothly until finally one Cincinnatian asked of the introducer :</head>

   <p>INFLUENCES OF FOREIGN TRAVEL .</p>
   <p>One of the remarks which an American is expected to make on returning from a foreign tour , especially his first return , is : “ Well I 'm a better American for having gone abroad , ” meaning that foreign travel has increased his love for his own country — in other words , has toned up his patriotism . * * * * * * * *</p>
   <p>Foreign travel will make any intelligent American a better citizen , because an increase of knowledge is a betterment . One honored resident of Washington , a gentleman past middle life , recently returned from his first European tour , and on being asked if he could make the stereotyped report of having been “ made a better American , ” replied : “ Yes ; I think I am a better American for having had a deal of conceit knocked out of me . ” That was a profitable experience .</p>
   <p>From Baltimore Sun , November , 1906 .</p>

   <p>It will be observed , that when giving me ( Boswell ) advice as to my travels , Dr. Johnson did not dwell upon cities , and palaces , and pictures , and shows . He was of Lord Essex 's opinion , who advises his kinsman , Roger , Earl of Rutland , “ rather to go a hundred miles to speak with one wise man , than five miles to see a fair town . ”</p>

   <p>Deuteronomy xxxiii , 19 — “ They shall suck of the abundance of the seas , and of the treasures hid in the sand . ”</p>
   <p>Among the hardships experienced by the first settlers in North America , they were sometimes greatly distressed for food , which led the women and the children to the sea side to look for a ship which they expected with provisions , but no ship appeared for many weeks ; they saw in the sand , however , vast quantities of shellfish , since called clams , a species of muscle . Hunger impelled them to taste , and at length they fed wholly upon them , and were as cheerful and well as they had been before in England , enjoying the best provision . It is added , that a good man , after they had all dined one day on clams , without bread , returned thanks to God for causing them to “ suck of the abundance of the seas , and of treasures hid in the sand . ” This text , which they had never before observed particularly , was ever after endeared to them .</p>

   <p>Deuteronomy xxii , 4 .— “ Thou shalt not see thy brother 's ox or ass fall down by the way , and hide thyself from them ; thou shalt surely help him lift them up again . ”</p>
   <p>Mr. George Herbert , the poet , when walking to Salisbury , saw a poor man , with a poorer horse , fallen under his load . Mr. Herbert perceiving this , put off his canonical coat , and helped the poor man to unload , and after to load his horse . The poor man blessed him for it , and he blessed the poor man , and gave him money to refresh both himself and his horse ; and told him , “ If he loved himself , he should be merciful to his beast . ” At his coming to his musical friends at Salisbury , they began to wonder that Mr. George Herbert , who used to be so clean , came in such a condition ; but he told them the occasion ; and when one of the company told him , “ he had disparaged himself by so dirty an employment , ” his answer was , “ That the thought of what he had done would prove music to him at midnight ; and the omission of it would have upbraided and made discord in his conscience , whensoever he should pass by the place . ”</p>

    <head>During the Rabbi 's absence from home , two of his sons died . Their mother hiding her grief , awaited the father 's return , and then said to him . “ My husband , some time since two jewels of inestimable value were placed with me for safe keeping . He who left them with me called for them to-day , and I delivered them into His hands . ” “ That is right , ” said the Rabbi approvingly . “ We must always return cheerfully and faithfully all that is placed in our care . ” Shortly after this , the Rabbi asked for his sons , and the mother , taking him by the hand , led him gently to the chamber of death . Meir gazed upon his sons , and realizing the truth , wept bitterly . “ Weep not , beloved husband , ” said his noble wife ; “ didst thou not say to me we must return cheerfully , when called for , all that has been placed under our care ? God gave us these jewels ; He left them with us for a time , and we gloried in their possession ; but now that He calls for His own , we should not repine . ”</head>

    <head>TRUE TO TRUTH .</head>
    <head>In an Eastern land a boy once set out from his mother 's home for a distant city , where he was to begin life and earn his livelihood . Before parting with him , his mother gave him forty gold dinars , which , for safety , she sewed inside his waistcoat . Her last counsel to him was , to seek and to follow always the truth . On his way he had to cross part of a desert , infested by robbers . One of these saw him and came galloping up “ Boy , what money have you got ? ” he sternly demanded . The boy looked up at him , and said , “ I have forty gold dinars sewed up in my waistcoat . ” The robber burst into a fit of laughter ; he thought the boy was joking . And , turning his horse , he galloped back to his troop . By-and-by , another horseman rode up to the boy as he trudged on , and made the same demand : “ Boy , what have you got ? ” “ Forty gold dinars , sewed up in my waistcoat , ” said the boy again . This robber , too , burst out laughing , and turned away , thinking the boy was making fun of him . They had some talk in their band about the boy 's strange reply . Their leader turning it over in his mind , said he would like to see him , and , leaving the troop , soon overtook the young traveler . He put the same question as the others , and again the boy gave the same answer . The captain leapt off his horse , and began to feel the boy 's clothes , till he counted — one , two , three — the forty gold dinars just as he had been told . “ What made you tell the truth , my boy ? ” he asked . “ My God and my mother , sir , ” was the reply . “ Wait for me here a little , ” said the captain , and galloped back to his troop . In a few minutes he returned , but so changed that the boy hardly knew him . By removing a false beard and other disguises , his appearance was quite altered . “ Come with me , my lad , ” he said ; and he pointed to the spires of a distant city . “ I cannot go with you , ” said the boy ; “ you are a robber ! ” “ I was , ” the man said , “ but all that is over now ! I have given it up forever . I have a large business in yonder city , and I wish you to come with me and share it . ” And so they went on together ; and when they arrived at the city the boy entered his employment , and ultimately became very wealthy and influential .</head>

    <head>A TOUCHING SCENE AT SEA .</head>
    <head>Two weeks ago on board an English steamer , a little ragged boy , aged nine years , was discovered on the fourth day of the voyage out from Liverpool to New York , and carried before the first mate , whose duty it was to deal with such cases . When questioned as to his object of being stowed away , and who brought him on board , the boy , who had a beautiful sunny face , and eyes that looked like the very mirrors of truth , replied that his step-father did it , because he could not afford to keep him , nor pay his passage out to Halifax , where he had an aunt who was well off , and to whose house he was going . The mate did not believe the story , in spite of the winning face and truthful accents of the boy . He had seen too much of stow-aways to be easily deceived by them , he said ; and it was his firm conviction that the boy had been brought on board and provided with food by the sailors . The little fellow was very roughly handled in consequence . Day by day he was questioned and re-questioned , but always with the same result . He did not know a sailor on board , and his father alone had secreted him and given him the food which he ate . At last the mate , wearied by the boy 's persistence in the same story , and perhaps a little anxious to inculpate the sailors , seized him one day by the collar , and , dragging him to the fore , told him that unless he would tell the truth in ten minutes from that time , he would hang him from the yard-arm . He then made him sit down under it on the deck . All around him were the passengers and sailors of the midway watch , and in front of him stood the inexorable mate , with his chronometer in his hand , and the other officers of the ship by his side . It was the finest sight , said our informant , that he ever beheld — to see the pale , proud , sorrowful face of that noble boy , his head erect , his beautiful blue eyes bright through the tears that suffused them . When eight minutes had fled , the mate told him he had but two minutes to live , and advised him to speak the truth and save his life ; but he replied with the utmost simplicity and sincerity by asking the mate if he might pray . The mate said nothing , but nodded his head and turned deadly pale , and shook with trembling like a reed with the wind , and there , all eyes turned on him , the brave and noble little fellow , this poor waif , whom society owned not , and whose own step-father could not care for him — there he knelt , with clasped hands , and eyes turned to heaven , while he repeated audibly the Lord 's prayer , and prayed the Lord Jesus to take him to heaven . Sobs broke from strong , hard hearts , as the mate sprang forward to the boy , and clasped him to his bosom , and kissed him and blessed him , and told him how sincerely he believed his story , and how glad he was that he had been brave enough to face death and be willing to sacrifice his life for the truth of his word .</head>

   <p>SPEAK GENTLY .</p>
   <p>“ Please buy my penny songs ! ” cried a feeble voice in one of the streets of a great city . The day was very cold , and little Katie had left her cheerless home to earn , if possible , a few pennies . Poor Katie ! Her little voice was feeble because her heart was sad , for so many passed her by unnoticed ; and she felt almost discouraged .</p>
   <p>Soon she found herself in a music store , standing near a beautiful lady , who was sitting there selecting music . She again uttered her little cry , “ Please buy a penny song ! ” but the lady , not hearing what she said , turned towards her , and , with the kindest , sweetest smile , said gently , “ What is it , darling ? ” at the same time putting a piece of money in her hand . Katie , not thinking what she did , laid her head in the lady 's lap , and cried as though her heart would break . The lady tried to soothe her ; and soon Katie said , “ O lady ! I cry , not because you gave money , but because you spoke so kindly to me . ”</p>

    <head>When George Washington was a boy , a beautiful cherry tree was killed in his father 's garden , by some violent hand stripping its bark . Mr. Washington said he would not have taken five guineas for the tree , and he would like to know the offender . Shortly after , seeing George with an axe in his hand , he asked him if he knew who had killed the cherry tree . George hesitated for a moment , then said , “ I cannot tell a lie , father , I cannot tell a lie . I cut it with the hatchet . ” “ Come to my arms , ” said his father ; “ you have paid for it a thousand times . ” Such an act of heroism in telling the truth he valued more than a thousand cherry trees .</head>

    <head>A RECOMMENDATION .</head>
    <head>The following verses were sent to a graduate of Wheaton Seminary of the class of 1866 by John G. Whittier , on the receipt of two pairs of long stockings , which the young woman had knit . She was a frequent visitor in the Whittier home , and often assisted in the entertainment of guests of honor . Mr. Whittier regarded the verses as doggerel , and expressed his intention of writing something worth while for his youthful admirer . But the poem reveals a humorous side of his character , differing from what one finds in his published poetry , and it is probable that neither Mr. Whittier nor his young friend , who died in her early womanhood , would have objected to the publication of the verses .</head>

   <p>THE WIFE .</p>
   <p>I have often had occasion to remark the fortitude with which women sustain the most overwhelming reverses of fortune . Those disasters which break down the spirit of a man , and prostrate him in the dust , seem to call forth all the energies of the softer sex , and give such intrepidity and elevation to their character , that at times it approaches to sublimity . Nothing can be more touching , than to behold a soft and tender female , who had been all weakness and dependence , and alive to every trivial roughness , while threading the prosperous paths of life , suddenly rising in mental force to be the comforter and supporter of her husband under misfortune and abiding with unshrinking firmness , the bitterest blasts of adversity .</p>
   <p>As the vine which has long twined its graceful foliage about the oak , and been lifted by it into sunshine , will , when the hardy plant is rifted by the thunder-bolt , cling round it with its caressing tendrils , and bind up its shattered boughs ; so it is beautifully ordered by Providence , that woman who is the mere dependent and ornament of man in his happier hours , should be his stay and solace when smitten with calamity ; winding herself into the rugged recesses of his nature , tenderly supporting the drooping head , and binding up the broken heart .</p>
   <p>I was once congratulating a friend , who had around him a blooming family , knit together in the strongest affection . “ I can wish you no better lot , ” said he , with enthusiasm , “ than to have a wife and children . If you are prosperous , there they are to share your prosperity ; if otherwise , there they are to comfort you . ” And , indeed , I have observed that a married man , falling into misfortune , is more apt to retrieve his situation in the world than a single one ; partly because he is more stimulated to exertion by the necessities of the helpless and beloved beings who depend upon him for subsistence ; but chiefly because his spirits are soothed and relieved by domestic endearments , and his self-respect kept alive by finding , that though all abroad is darkness and humiliation , yet there is still a little world of love at home , of which he is the monarch . Whereas , a single man is apt to run to waste and self-neglect ; to fancy himself lonely and abandoned , and his heart to fall to ruin , like some deserted mansion , for want of an inhabitant .</p>
   <p>These observations call to mind a little domestic story , of which I was once a witness . My intimate friend , Leslie , had married a beautiful and accomplished girl , who had been brought up in the midst of fashionable life . She had , it is true , no fortune , but that of my friend was ample ; and he delighted in the anticipation of indulging her in elegant pursuit , and administering to those delicate tastes and fancies that spread a kind of witchery about the sex .— “ Her life , ” said he , “ shall be like a fairy tale . ”</p>
   <p>The very difference in their characters produced a harmonious combination ; he was of a romantic and somewhat serious cast ; she was all life and gladness . I have often noticed the mute rapture with which he would gaze upon her in company , of which her sprightly powers made her the delight ; and how , in the midst of applause , her eye would still turn to him , as if there alone she sought favor and acceptance . When leaning on his arm , her slender form contrasted finely with his tall , manly person . The fond confiding air with which she looked up to him seemed to call forth a flush of triumphant pride and cherishing tenderness , as if he doted on his lovely burden for its very helplessness . Never did a couple set forward on a flowery path of early and well-suited marriage with a fairer prospect of felicity .</p>
   <p>It was the misfortune of my friend , however , to have embarked his property in large speculations ; and he had not been married many months when , by a succession of sudden disasters , it was swept from him , and he found himself reduced to almost penury . For a time he kept his situation to himself , and went about with a haggard countenance and a breaking heart . His life was but a protracted agony ; and what rendered it more insupportable was the necessity of keeping up a smile in the presence of his wife ; for he could not bring himself to overwhelm her with the news . She saw , however , with the quick eyes of affection , that all was not well with him . She marked his altered looks and stifled sighs , and was not to be deceived by his sickly and vapid attempts at cheerfulness . She tasked all her sprightly powers and tender blandishments to win him back to happiness ; but she only drove the arrow deeper into his soul . The more he saw cause to love her , the more torturing was the thought that he was soon to make her wretched . A little while , thought he , and the smile will banish from that cheek — the song will die away from those lips — the lustre of those eyes will be quenched with sorrow — and the happy heart which now beats lightly in that bosom will be weighed down , like mine , by the cares and miseries of the world .</p>
   <p>At length he came to me one day , and related his whole situation in a tone of the deepest despair . When I had heard him through , I inquired , “ Does your wife know all this ? ” At the question he burst into an agony of tears . “ For God 's sake ! ” cried he , “ if you have any pity on me , do n't mention my wife ; it is the thought of her that drives me almost to distraction ! ”</p>
   <p>“ And why not ? ” said I :— “ She must know it sooner or later : you cannot keep it long from her , and the intelligence may break upon her in a more startling manner than if imparted by yourself ; for the accents of those we love soften the harshest tidings . Besides , you are depriving yourself of the comforts of her sympathy ; and not merely that , but also endangering the only bond that can keep hearts together — an unreserved community of thought and feeling . She will soon perceive that something is secretly preying upon your mind ; and true love will not brook reserve : it feels undervalued and outraged , when even the sorrows of those it loves are concealed from it . ”</p>
   <p>“ Oh , but my friend ! to think what a blow I am to give to all her future prospects — how I am to strike her very soul to the earth , by telling her that her husband is a beggar !— that she is to forego all the elegancies of life — all the pleasures of society — to shrink with me into indigence and obscurity ! To tell her that I have dragged her down from the sphere in which she might have continued to move in constant brightness — the light of every eye — the admiration of every heart !— How can she bear poverty ? She has been brought up in all the refinements of opulence * * * ”</p>
   <p>I saw his grief was eloquent , and I let it have its flow ; for sorrow relieves itself by words . When his paroxysm had subsided , and he had relapsed into moody silence , I resumed the subject gently , and urged him to break his situation at once to his wife . He shook his head mournfully , but positively .</p>
   <p>“ But how are you to keep it from her ? It is necessary she should know it , that you may take the steps proper to the alteration of your circumstances . You must change your style of living — nay , ” observing a pang to pass across his countenance , “ do n't let that afflict you . I am sure you never placed your happiness in outward show — you have yet friends , warm friends , who will not think the worse of you for being less splendidly lodged ; and surely it does not require a palace to be happy with Mary — ” “ I could be happy with her , ” cried he convulsively , “ in a hovel ! * ”</p>
   <p>“ Believe me , my friend , ” said I , stepping up , and grasping him warmly by the hand , “ she can be the same with you . Ay , more : it will be a source of pride and triumph to her — it will call forth all the latent energies and fervent sympathies of her nature ; for she will rejoice to prove that she loves you for yourself . There is in every true woman 's heart a spark of heavenly fire , which lies dormant in the broad daylight of prosperity ; but which kindles up , and beams and blazes in the dark hour of adversity . ” I finished by persuading him to go home and unburden his sad heart to his wife .</p>
   <p>I must confess , notwithstanding all I have said , I felt some little solicitude for the result . Who can calculate on the fortitude of one whose whole life has been a round of pleasures ? Her gay spirits might revolt at the dark downward path of low humility , suddenly pointed out before her , and might cling to the sunny regions in which they had hitherto reveled .</p>
   <p>In short , I could not meet Leslie next morning without trepidation . He had made the disclosure .</p>
   <p>“ And how did she bear it ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Like an Angel ! It seemed rather to be a relief to her mind , for she threw her arms around my neck , and asked if this was all that had lately made me unhappy . ”</p>
   <p>Some days afterwards , he called upon me in the evening . He had disposed of his dwelling-house , and taken a small cottage in the country , a few miles from town . He had been busy all day in sending out furniture . The new establishment required few articles , and those of the simplest kind . All the splendid furniture of his late residence had been sold , excepting his wife 's harp . That , he said was too closely associated with the idea of herself ; it belonged to the little story of their loves ; for some of the sweetest moments of their courtship were those when he had leaned over that instrument , and listened to the melting tones of her voice . I could not but smile at this instance of romantic gallantry in a doting husband .</p>
   <p>He was now going out to the cottage , where his wife had been all day superintending its arrangement . My feelings had become strongly interested in the progress of this family story , and as it was a fine evening , I offered to accompany him .</p>
   <p>He was wearied with the fatigues of the day , and as we walked out , fell into a fit of gloomy musing .</p>
   <p>“ Poor Mary ! ” at length broke , with a heavy sigh , from his lips .</p>
   <p>“ And what of her , ” asked I , “ has anything happened to her ? ”</p>
   <p>“ What , ” said he , darting an impatient glance , “ is it nothing to be reduced to this paltry situation — to be caged in a miserable cottage — to be obliged to toil almost in the menial concerns of her wretched habitation ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Has she then repined at the change ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Repined ! she has been nothing but sweetness and good humor . Indeed , she seems in better spirits than I have ever known her ; she has been to me all love and tenderness and comfort ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Admirable girl ! ” exclaimed I , “ You call yourself poor , my friend ; you never were so rich — you never knew the boundless treasures of excellence you possessed in that woman . ”</p>
   <p>“ Oh ! but , my friend , if this first meeting at the cottage were over , I think I could then be comfortable . But this is her first day of real experience : she has been introduced into an humble dwelling — she has been employed all day , in arranging its miserable equipments — she has for the first time known the fatigues of domestic employment — she has for the first time looked around her on a home destitute of everything elegant — almost of everything convenient ; and may now be sitting down , exhausted and spiritless , brooding over a prospect of future poverty . ”</p>
   <p>There was a degree of probability in this picture that I could not gainsay , so we walked on in silence .</p>
   <p>After turning from the main road , up a narrow lane , so thickly shaded by forest trees as to give it a complete air of seclusion , we came in sight of the cottage . It was humble enough in its appearance for the most pastoral poet ; and yet it had a most pleasing rural look . * * * * * Just as we approached we heard the sound of music — Leslie grasped my arm ; we paused and listened . It was Mary 's voice singing , in a style of the most touching simplicity , a little Scotch air of which her husband was peculiarly fond .</p>
   <p>I felt Leslie 's hand tremble on my arm . He stepped forward to hear more distinctly . His step made a noise on the gravel walk . A bright beautiful face glanced out at the window and vanished — a light footstep was heard — and Mary came tripping forth to meet us . She was in a pretty rural dress of white ; a few wild flowers were twisted in her fine hair ; a fresh bloom was on her cheek ; her whole countenance beamed with smiles — I had never seen her look so lovely .</p>
   <p>“ My dear George , ” cried she , “ I am so glad you are come ; I have been watching and watching for you ; and running down the lane and looking out for you . I 've set out a table under a beautiful tree behind the cottage ; and I 've been gathering some of the most delicious strawberries , for I know you are so fond of them — and we have such excellent cream — and everything is so sweet and still here .— Oh ! ” said she , putting her arm within his , and looking up brightly in his face , “ Oh , we shall be so happy ! ”</p>
   <p>Poor Leslie was overcome . He caught her to his bosom — he folded his arms around her — he kissed her again and again — he could not speak for the tears gushed into his eyes .</p>
   <p>He has often assured me that though the world has since gone prosperously with him , and his life has indeed been a happy one , yet never has he experienced a moment of more exquisite felicity than the time when I accompanied him to the little cottage in the country .</p>

    <head>AN ILL-TEMPERED LETTER .</head>
    <head>An ill-tempered letter , once sent , will sometimes embitter a life-time . We once saw an old gentleman , with a wise , fine head , calm face , and a most benevolent look , beg of a postmaster to return him a letter which he had dropped into the box . To do so , as everybody knows , is illegal ; but won over by the old gentleman 's importunity , the postmaster complied , upon full proof , in comparing the writing etc . being given . Then , with a beaming face , the old gentleman tore the letter into fragments , and , scattering them to the winds , exclaimed — “ Ah ! I 've preserved my friend . ” The fact is , he had written a letter in a state of irritation , which was probably unjust and hurtful , but which he had wisely recalled . “ Written words remain , ” is not only a proverb , but a very grave caution ; and hence the advice — never write in anger , or , at any rate , keep your letter till next morning , when you probably will be cool and in a better frame of mind .</head>

    <head>IMPORTANCE OF ATTENDING PUBLIC WORSHIP .</head>
    <head>Said the Rev . W. J. Dawson : “ I know in my own heart how soon the spirit of devoutness fades when from any cause I am deprived of public worship for any length of time . And when I see a youth to whom religious worship has been the atmosphere of his childhood , gradually withdrawing himself from the means of grace , I tremble for him , because I have seen what that means . I can think of men whom I loved , and who now lead wretched and degraded lives , and all their misery began when they forsook the tabernacles of their God . ”</head>

    <head>HANDWRITING — NATIONALITY OF .</head>
    <head>It is a remarkable fact , that no man can ever get rid of the style of handwriting peculiar to his country . If he be English , he always writes in English style ; if French , in French style ; if German , Italian , or Spanish , in the style peculiar to his nation . Professor B —— states :— “ I am acquainted with a Frenchman , who has passed all his life in England , who speaks English like one of our own countrymen , and writes it with ten times the correctness of ninety-nine in a hundred of us ; but yet who cannot , for the life of him , imitate our mode of writing . I knew a Scotch youth , who was educated entirely in France , and resided eighteen years in that country , mixing exclusively with French people , but who , although he had a French writing-master , and , perhaps , never saw anything but French writing in his life , or rarely , yet wrote exactly in the Scotch style . ”</head>
