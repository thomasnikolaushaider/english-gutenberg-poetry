     <p>— Beranger . Morris has hung the most beautiful thoughts in the world upon hinges of [ illegible ] ; and his songs are destined to roll over bright lips enough to form a [ sonnet ? illegible ] . His sentiments are simple , honest , truthful , and familiar ; his language is pure and eminently musical , and he is prodigally full of the poetry of every-day living . — Willis . The distinction with which the name of General Morris is now associated in a permanent connection with what is least factitious or fugitive in American Art , is admitted and known ; but the class of young men of letters in this country , at present , can hardly appreciate the extent to which they , and the profession to which they belong , are indebted to his animated exertions , his varied talents , his admirable resources of temper , during a period of twenty years , and at a time when the character of American literature , both at home and abroad was yet to be formed . The first great service which the literary taste of this country received , was rendered by Dennie ; a remarkable man ; qualified by nature and attainments to be a leader in new circumstances ; fit to take part in the formation of a national literature ; as a vindicator of independence in thought , able to establish freedom without disturbing the obligations of law ; as a conservative in taste , skilful to keep the tone of the great models with which his studies were familiar , without copying their style ; by both capacities successful in developing the one , unchangeable spirit of Art , under a new form and with new effects . In this office of field-marshal of our native forces , General Morris succeeded him under increased advantages , in some respect with higher powers , in a different , and certainly a vastly more extended sphere of influence . The manifold and lasting benefits which , as editor of “ The Mirror , ” General Morris conferred on art and artists of every kind , by his tact , his liberality , the superiority of his judgement , and the vigor of his abilities ; by the perseverance and address with which he disciplined a corps of youthful writers , in the presence of a constant and heavy fire from the batteries of foreign criticism ; by the rare combination , so valuable in dealing with the numerous aspirants in authorship with whom his position brought him in contact ; of a quick , true eye to discern in the modesty of some nameless manuscript the future promises of a power hardly yet conscious of itself ; a discretion to guide by sound advice , and a generosity to aid with the most important kind of assistance ; the firm and open temper which his example tended to inspire into the relations of literary men with one another throughout the land ; and more than all , perhaps , by the harmony and union , of such inappreciable value , especially in the beginning of national effort , between the several sister arts of writing , music , painting , and dramatic exhibition , which the singular variety and discursiveness of his intellectual sympathies led him constantly to maintain and vindicate ; these , in the multiplicity of their operation , and the full power of their joint effect , can be perfectly understood only by those who possessed a contemporaneous knowledge of the circumstances , and who , remembering the state of things at the commencement of the period alluded to , and observing what existed at the end of it , are able to look back over the whole interval , and see to what influences and what persons the extraordinary change which has taken place , is to be referred . If , at this moment , the literary genius of America , renewed in youth , and quivering lie the eagle 's wings with excess of vigor , seems about to make a new flight , from a higher vantage-ground , into loftier depths of airy distance , the capacity to take that flight must , to a great degree , be ascribed to those two persons whom we have named ; without whose services the brighter era which appears now to be dawning , might yet be distant and doubtful . Besides these particulars of past effort , which ought to make his countrymen love the reputation of the subject of this notice , we regret that our limits forbid us to speak at large of those more intimate qualities of personal value , which , in our judgment , form the genuine lustre of one who , admirable for other attainments , is to be imitated in these . To us it is an instinctive feeling that a wrong is done to the proper grandeur of our complex nature — that a violence is offered to the higher consciousness of our immortal being — whenever an intellectual quality is extolled tot he neglect of a moral one . Moral excellence is the most real genius ; and a temper to cope and calmly baffle the multitudinous assaults of the spiritual enmity of active life , is a talent which outshines all praise of mental endowments . Unhappily , the biographer of literary creators affords few occasions in which a feeling of this kind can be indulged and gratified : that sensibility of mental apprehensions which is the fame of the author , is usually attended by a susceptibility of passionate impression which is the fate of the man ; and earth and sense delight to wreak their destructive vengences upon the spiritual nature of him , of whose intellectual being they are the slaves and the sport . In the present instance , we are concerned with the character — ‘ totus , teres , atque rotundus ; ’ which may be looked upon , from every side , with an equal satisfaction . Search the wide world over , and you shall not find among the literary men of any nation , one on whom the dignity of a free and manly spirit sits with a grace more native and familiar — whose spontaneous sentiments have a truer tone of nobleness — the course of whose usual feelings is more expanded and honorable — whose acts , whether common and daily , or deliberate and much-considered , are wont at all times to be more beautifully impressed with those marks of sincerity , of modesty , and of justice , which form the very seal of worth in conduct . Those jealousies , and littlenesses , and envyings , which prey upon the spirits of many men , as the vulture on the heart that chained Prometheus — and whose fierce besetment they who WILL be magnanimous , have to fight off , as one drives away the eagles from their prey , with voice and gestures — seem never to assail him . It is the happiness of his nature to have THAT only absolute deliverance from evil which is implied in being rendered insensible to temptation . While the duty which is laid upon us , in this paper , mainly is to open and set forth his poetic praises and claim the laurel for his literary merits ; when the crown of song is to be conferred upon him , we shall interpose to beg that the chaplet may be accompanied by some mark , or some inscription which shall declare , “ This is the reward of moral excellence . ” For the success of our special purpose , in this notice , which is to consider and make apparent the specific character which belongs to General Morris as a literary artist and a poetic creator , to explain his claims to that title which the common voice of the country has given to him — of The Song-Writer of America — it would have probably been more judicious had we kept out of view the matters of which we have just spoken . It is recorded of a Grecian painter , that having completed the picture of a sleeping nymph , he added on the foreground the figure of a satyr gazing in amazement upon her beauty ; but finding that the secondary form attracted universal praise , he erased it as diverting applause from that which he desired to have regarded as the principal monument of his skill . There is in this anecdote a double wisdom ; the world is as little willing to yield to a twofold superiority as it is able to appreciate two distinct objects at once . In a review of literary reputations , perhaps nothing is fitted to raise more surprise than the obvious inequality in the extend and greatness of the labors to which an equal reward of fame has been allotted . The abounding energy and picturesque variety of Homer are illustrated in eight-and-forty books : the remains of Sappho might be written on the surface of a leaf of the laurus nobilis . Yet if the one expands before us with the magnificent extent , the diversified surface , the endless decorations of the earth itself , the other hangs on high , like a lone , clear star — small but intense — flashing upon us through the night of ages , invested with circumstances of divinity not less unquestionable than those which attend the venerable majesty of the Ancient of Song . The rich and roseate light that shines around the name of Mimnermus , is shed from some dozen or twenty lines : the immortality of Tyrtaeus rests upon a stanza or two , which have floated to us with their precious freight , over the sea of centuries , and will float on unsubmergible by all the waves of Time . The soul of Simonides lives to us in a single couplet ; but that is the very stuff of Eternity , which neither fire will assoil , nor tempest peril , nor the wrath of years impair . The Infinite has no degrees ; wherever the world sees in any human being the fire of the Everlasting , it bows with equal awe , whether that fire is displayed by only an occasional flash , or by a prolonged and diffusive blaze . There is a certain tone which , hear it when we may , and where we may , we know to be the accents of the gods ; and whether its quality be shown in a single utterance , or its volume displayed in a thousand bursts of music , we surround the band of spirits whom we there detect in their mortal disguise , with equal ceremonies of respect and worship , hailing them alike as seraphs of a brighter sphere — sons of the morning . This is natural , and it is reasonable . Genius is not a degree of other qualities , nor is it a particular way or extent of displaying such qualities ; it is a faculty by itself ; it is a manner , of which we may judge with the same certainty from one exhibition , as from many . The praise of a poet , therefore , is to be determined not by the nature of the work which he undertakes , but by the kind of mastery which he shows ; not by the breadth of surface over which he toils , but by the perfectness of the result which he attains . Mr. Wordsworth has vindicated the capacity of the sonnet to be a casket of the richest gems of fame . We have no doubt that the song may give evidence of a genius which shall deserve to be ranked with the constructor of an epic . “ Scorn not the SONG . ” We would go so far , indeed , as to say that success in the song imports , necessarily , a more inborn and genuine gift of poetic conception , than the same proportion of success in other less simple modes of art . There are some sorts of composition which may be wrought out of eager feeling and the foam of excited passions ; and which are therefore to a large extent within the reach of earnest sensibilities and an ambitious will ; others are the spontaneous outflow of the heart , to whose perfection , turbulence and effort are fatal . Of the latter kind is the song . While the ode allows of exertion and strain , what is done in it must be accomplished by native and inherent strength . Speaking with that confidence which may not improperly be assumed by one who , having looked with some care at the foundations of the opinion which he expresses , supposes himself able , if called upon by denial , to furnish such demonstration of its truth as the nature of the matter allows of , we say that , in our judgment , there is no professed writer of songs , in this day , who has conceived the true character of this delicate and peculiar creation of art , with greater precision and justness than Mr. Morris , or been more felicitous than he in dealing with the subtle and multiform difficulties that beset its execution . It is well understood by those whose thoughts are used to be conversant with the suggestions of a deeper analysis than belongs to popular criticism , that the forms of literary art are not indefinite in number , variable in their characteristics , or determined by the casual taste or arbitrary will of authors : they exist in nature ; they are dependent upon those fixed laws of intellectual being , of spiritual affection , and moral choice , which constitute the rationality of man . And the actual , positive merit of a poetical production — that real merit , which consists in native vitality , in inherent capacity to live — does not lie in the glitter or costliness of the decorations with which it is invested — nor in the force with which it is made to spring from the mind of its creator into the minds of others — nor yet in the scale of magnitude upon which the ideas belonging to the subject are illustrated in the work ; but rather , as we suppose , obviously , and in all cases , upon the integrity and truth with which the particular form that has been contemplated by the artist , is brought out , and the distinctness with which that one specific impression which is appropriate to it , is attained . This is the kind of excellence which we ascribe to Mr. Morris ; an excellence of a lofty order ; genuine , sincere , and incapable of question ; more valuable in this class of composition than in any other , because both more important and more difficult . For the song appears to us to possess a definiteness peculiarly jealous and exclusive ; to be less flexible in character and to permit less variety of tone than most other classes of composition . If a man shall say , “ I will put more force into my song than your model allows , I will charge it with a greater variety of impressions , ” it is well ; if he is skilful , he may make something that is very valuable . But in so far as his work is more than a song , it is not a song . In all works of Art — wherever form is concerned — excess is error . The just notion and office of the modern song , as we think of it , is to be the embodiment and expression , in beauty , of some one of those sentiments or thoughts , gay , moral , pensive , joyous , or melancholy , which are as natural and appropriate , in particular circumstances , or to certain occasions , as the odor to the flower ; rising at such seasons , into the minds of all classes of persons , instinctive and unbidden , yet in obedience to some law of association which it is the gift of the poet to apprehend . Its graceful purpose is to exhibit an incident in the substance of an emotion , to communicate wisdom in the form of sentiment ; it is the refracted gleam of some wandering ray from the fair orb of moral truth , which glancing against some occurrence in common life , is surprised into a smile of quick-darting , many colored beauty ; it is the airy ripple that is thrown up when the current of feeling in human hearts accidentally encounters the current of thought and bubbles forth with a gentle fret of sparkling foam . Self-evolved , almost , and obedient in its development and shaping to some inward spark of beauty which appears to possess and control its course , it might almost seem that , in the out-going loveliness of such productions , sentiment made substantial in language , floated abroad in natural self-delivery ; as that heat which is not yet flame , gives forth in blue wreaths of vaporous grace , which unfold their delicateness for a moment upon the tranquil air , and then vanish away . It is not an artificial structure built up by intellect after a model foreshaped by fancy , or foreshadowed by the instincts of the passions ; it is a simple emotion , crystalled into beauty by passing for a moment through the cooler air of the mind ; it is merely an effluence of creative vigor ; a graceful feeling thickened into words . Its proper dwelling is in the atmosphere of the sentiments , no the passions ; it will not , indeed , repel the sympathy of deeper feelings , but knows them rather under the form of the flower that floats upon the surface of meditation , than of the deeper root that lies beneath its stream . And this is the grievous fault of nearly all Lord Byron 's melodies ; that he pierces them too profoundly , and passes below the region of grace , charging his lyre with far more vehemence of passion than its slight strings are meant to bear . The beauty which belongs to this production , should be in the form of the thought rather than the fashion of the setting : that genuineness and simplicity of character which constitute almost its essence , are destroyed by any appearance of the cold artifices of construction , palpable springs set for our admiration , whereby the beginning is obviously arranged in reference to a particular ending . This is the short-reaching power of Moore — guilty , by design , of that departure from simplicity , by which he fascinated one generation at the expense of being forgotten by another . The song , while it is general in its impression , should be particular in its occasion ; not an abstraction of the mind , but a definite feeling , special to some certain set of circumstances . Rising from out the surface of daily experience , like the watery issuings of a fountain , it throws itself upward for a moment , then descends in a soft , glittering shower to the level whence it rose . Herein resides the chief defect of Bayly 's songs ; that they are too general and vague — a species of pattern songs — being embodiments of some general feeling , or reflection , but lacking that sufficient reference to some season or occurrence which would justify their appearing , and take away from them the aspect of pretension and display . The only satisfactory method of criticism is by means of clinical lectures ; and we feel regret that our limits do not suffer us — to any great degree — to illustrate what we deem the vigorous simplicity , and genuine grace of Mr. Morris , by that mode of exposition . We must refer to a few cases , however , to show what we have been meaning in the remarks which we made above , upon the proper character of the song . The ballad of “ Woodman , spare that tree ” — one of those accidents of genius which , however , never happen but to consummate artists — is so familiar to every mind and heart , as to resent citation . Take , then , “ My Mother 's Bible . ” We know of no similar production in a truer taste , in a purer style , or more distinctly marked with the character of a good school of composition . Or take “ We were boys together . ” In manly pathos , in tenderness and truth , where shall it be excelled ? “ The Miniature ” posses the captivating elegance of Voiture . “ Where Hudson 's Wave ” is a glorious burst of poetry , modulated into refinement by the hand of a master . Where will you find a nautical song , seemingly more spontaneous in its genial outbreak , really more careful in its construction , than “ Land-ho ! ” How full of the joyous madness of absolute independence , yet made harmonious by instinctive grace , is “ Life in the West ! ” That the same heart whose wild pulse is thrilled by the adventurous interests of the huntsman and the wanderer , can beat in unison with the gentlest truth of deep devotion , is shown in “ When other Friends are round Thee . ” “ I love the Night ” has the voluptuous elegance of the Spanish models . Were we to meet the lines “ Oh , think of me ! ” in an anthology , we should suppose they were Suckling 's — so admirably is the tone of feeling kept down to the limit of probable sincerity — which is a characteristic that the cavalier style of courting never loses . “ The Star of Love ” might stand as a selected specimen of all that is most exquisite in the songs of the “ Trouveurs . ” “ The Seasons of Love ” is a charming effusion of gay , yet thoughtful sentiment . The song , “ I never have been false to thee , ” is , of itself , sufficient to establish General Morris 's fame as a great poet — as a “ potens magister affectuum ” — and as a literary creator of a high order . It is a thoroughly fresh and effective poem on a subject as hackneyed as the highway ; it is as deep as truth itself , yet light as the movement of a dance . We had almost forgotten , what the world will never forget , the matchless softness and transparent delicacy of “ Near the Lake . ” Those lines , of themselves , unconsciously , court “ the soft promoter of the poet 's strain , ” and almost seem about to break into music . It is agreeable to find that , instead of being seduced into a false style by the excessive popularity which many of his songs have acquired , General Morris 's later efforts are in a vein even more truly classic than his earlier ones , and show a decided advance , both in power and ease . “ The Rock of the Pilgrims , ” and the “ Indian Songs , ” are a very clear evidence of this . We would willingly go on with our references , as there are several which have equal claims with these upon our notice , but — “ claudite jam rivos . ” Such are some of the compositions , original in style , natural in spirit , beautiful with the charm of almost faultless execution , which may challenge for their author the title of the lauraete of America .... A writer in “ Howitt 's and the People 's Journal ” furnishes the following sketch of General Morris and his Songs , which was copied and endorsed by the late Dr. Rufus W. Griswold , in his International Magazine :—</p>
    </epigraph>
    <docImprint>“ Before us lies a heap of songs and ballads , the production of the rich fancy and warm heart of George P. Morris . Not many weeks since , at a public meeting in<settlement>London</settlement>, a gentleman claimed to be heard speak on the ground of his connection with the public press from the time when he was seven years of age . We will not undertake to say that General Morris ran his juvenile fingers over the chords of the lyre at so very early a period ; but it is certain he tried his hand at writing for the newspapers when he was yet but a mere boy . While in his teens , he was a constant contributor to various periodicals . Many of his articles attracted notice . He began to acquire a literary reputation ; and at length , in<date>1823</date>, being then in his twentieth year , he became editor of the ‘<settlement>New York</settlement>Mirror . ’ This responsible post he continued to hold until the termination of the paper 's existence in<date>1834</date>. “ Morris accomplished an infinity of good in the twenty years during which he wielded the editorial pen . Perhaps no other man in the<country>United States</country>was so well qualified for the noble task he set himself at the outset of his career as editor . American literature was in its infancy , and subject to all the weaknesses of that period . Morris resolved to do his utmost toward forming a character for it , and looked abroad anxiously for such as could aid him in his endeavor . The ‘ Mirror ” will ever be fondly remembered by the American literary man , for it has been the cradle of American genius . “ To him a writer in ‘ Graham 's Magazine ’ attributes the present flourishing condition and bright prospects of transatlantic literature . He evidently possesses a personal knowledge of General Morris , and discourses right eloquently in his praise . Nor do we think that he overrates his merits in the least . From other sources we have ourselves learned much of the genial nature of George P. Morris , and his gigantic labors as a literary pioneer . Considering its juvenility as a nation , republican<country>America</country>, indeed , has been amazingly prolific of good writers . The large share Morris has had in awakening the latent talent of his countrymen , must ever be to him a high source of gratulation . And then , as an original writer , he has won for himself a high place among literary Americans ; he is , in fact , known throughout the States as ‘ The Songwriter of<country>America</country>; ’ and we have the authority of Willis for stating that ‘ ninety-nine people out of a hundred — take them as they come in the census — would find more to admire in Morris 's Songs than in the writings of any other American poet . ’ Willis also tells us , as proof of the General 's popularity with those shrewd dollar-loving men , the publishers , that ‘ he can , at any time , obtain fifty dollars for a song unread , when the whole remainder of the American Parnassus could not sell one to the same buyer for a single shilling ! ’ He is the best-known poet of the country by acclamation — not by criticism . “ Morris seems to have had juster notions of what was required in a song than many who have achieved celebrity as song-writers in<country>England</country>. ‘ The just office and notion of the modern song ’ has been defined to be , the embodiment and expression in beauty of some thought or sentiment — gay , pensive , moral , or sentimental — which is as natural and appropriate in certain circumstances as the odor to the flower . Its graceful purpose is to exhibit an incident in the substance of an emotion , to communicate wisdom in the form of sentiment . A song should be the embodiment of some general feeling , and have reference to some season or occurrence . “ It is not a difficult thing to make words rhyme ; some of the most unimaginative intellects we ever knew could do so with surprising facility . It is rare to find a sentimental miss or a lackadaisical master who cannot accomplish this INTELLECTUAL feat , with the help of Walker 's Rhyming Dictionary . As for love , why , every one writes about it now-a-days . There is such an abhorrence of the simple Saxon — such an outrageous running after outlandish phraseology — that we wonder folks are satisfied with this plain term . “ We wonder they do not seek for an equivalent in high Dutch or in low Dutch , in Hungarian , or in Hindostanee . We wish they would , with all our heart and soul . We have no objection , provided the heart be touched , that a head should produce a little of the stuff called ‘ nonsense verses ’ — that this article should be committed to scented note-paper , and carefully sealed up with skewered hearts of amazing corpulence . God forbid that we should be thought guilty of a sneer at real affection !— far from it ; such ever commands our reverence . But we do not find it in the noisy tribe of goslings green who would fain be thought of the nightingale species . Did the reader ever contemplate a child engaged in the interesting operation of sucking a lollipop ?— we assure him that that act was dictated by quite as much of true sentiment as puts in action the fingers and wits of the generality of our young amatory poetasters . “ We know of none who have written more charmingly of love than George P. Morris . Would to Apollo that our rhymsters would condescend to read carefully his poetical effusions ! But they contain no straining after effect — no extravagant metaphors — no driveling conceits ; and so there is little fear of their being taken as models by those gentlemen . Let the reader mark the surprising excellence of the love songs ; their perfect naturalness ; the quiet beauty of the similes ; the fine blending of graceful thought and tender feeling which characterize them . Morris is , indeed , the poet of home joys . None have described more eloquently the beauty and dignity of true affection — of passion based upon esteem ; and his fame is certain to endure while the Anglo-Saxon woman has a hearthstone over which to repeat her most cherished household words . “ Seldom have the benign effects of the passion been more felicitously painted than in the ‘ Seasons of Love ’ ; and what simple tenderness is contained in the ballad of ‘ We were boys together . ’ Every word in that beautiful melody comes home to the heart of him whose early days have been happy . God help those in whom this poem awakens no fond remembrances !— those whose memories it does not get wandering up the stream of life , toward its source ; beholding at every step the sun smiling more brightly , the heavens assuming a deeper hue , the grass a fresher green , and the flowers a sweeter perfume . How wondrous are not its effects upon ourselves ! The wrinkles have disappeared from our brow , and the years from our shoulder , and the marks of the branding-iron of experience from our heart ; and again we are a careless child , gathering primroses , and chasing butterflies , and drinking spring-water from out the hollow of our hands . Around us are the hedges ‘ with golden gorse bright blossoming , as none blossom now-a-day . ’ We have heard of death , but we know not what it is ; and the word CHANGE has no meaning for us ; and summer and winter , and seed-time and harvest , has each its unutterable joys . Alas ! we can never remain long in this happy dream-land . Nevertheless , we have profited greatly by the journey . The cowslips and violets gathered by us in childhood , shall be potent in the hour of temptation ; and the cap of rushes woven for us by kind hands in days gone by , shall be a surer defence than a helmet of steel in the hour of battle . No , no ; we will never disgrace our antecedents . “ There is one quality in his songs to which we can not but direct attention — and this is their almost feminine purity . The propensities have had their laureates ; and genius , alas ! has often defiled its angel wings by contact with the sensual and the impure ; but Morris has never attempted to robe vice in beauty ; and as has been well remarked , his lays can bring to the cheek of purity no blush save that of pleasure . ” The following letter , from the pen of Grace Greenwood , is a lady 's tribute to the genius of the poet :— “ I have read of late , with renewed pleasure and higher appreciation , the songs and ballads of our genial-hearted countryman , Morris . I had previously worried myself by a course of rather dry reading , and his poetry , tender , musical , fresh , and natural , came to me like spring 's first sunshine , the song of her first birds , the breath of her first violets .</docImprint>

     <p>“ What a contrast is this pleasant volume to the soul-racking “ Festus , ” which has been one of my recent passions . That remarkable work has passages of great beauty and power , linked in unnatural marriage with much that is poor and weak . It is like a stately ruined palace , ‘ Mingling its marble with the dust of Rome ; ’ or it is like its own fabled first temple built to God , in the new earth — a multitude of gems , swallowed by an earthquake , and scattered through a world of baser matter . The soul of the reader now faints with excess of beauty , now shudders at the terrible and the revolting . the young poet 's muse at times goes like Proserpine to gather flowers , but straightway is seized by the lord of the infernal regions , and disappears in flame and darkness . The entire volume is a poetical Archipelago — isles of loveliness sprinkling a dead sea of unprofitable matter . “ It were absurd to compare the light and graceful poems of Morris with the work “ Festus ” — a simple Grecian arch with a stupendous Turkish mosque — an Etruscan vase with a Gothic tower . Yet there are doubtless many who will prefer the perfect realization of modest aspirations , to grand , but ineffectual graspings after glory 's highest and most divine guerdons — a quiet walk with truth and nature , to an Icarus flight of magnificent absurdities . “ It has been said that the author of ‘ Long time ago ’ has rung too many changes on the sentiment and passion of LOVE . Love , the inspiration of the glorious bards of old , ‘ Who play upon the heart as on a harp , And make our eyes bright as we speak of them ; ’ ‘ love ever-new , everlasting , fresh , and beautiful , now as when the silence of young Eden was thrilled , but scarce broken , by the voice of the first lover — a joy and a source of joy for ever . ’ “ I know it is much the fashion now-a-days , to hold in lordly contempt many of those sweet and holy influences which are — ‘ As angel hands , enclosing ours , Leading us back to Paradisean bowers . ’ “ Love and liberty are fast becoming mere abstractions to the enlightened apprehension of some modern wise men . It is sad to see how soon those white-winged visitors soil their plumage and change their very nature by a mere descent into the philosophic atmosphere of such mind . One is reminded of the words of Swedenborg — ‘ I saw a great truth let down from heaven into hell , and it THERE BECAME A LIE . ’ “ This cynical objection to the lays of our minstrel , surely never could have emanated from the heart of WOMAN . SHE is ever loyal to love — that tender and yearning principle in the bosom of the Father , from which and by which the feminine nature was created . “ The poems of Morris are indeed like those flowers of old , born of the blood-drops which oozed from the wounded foot of the queen of love — blushing crimson to the very heart ; yet there is not , to my knowledge , in the whole range of English literature , so large a collection of amatory songs in which sensualism and voluptuousness find no voice . These lays can bring to the cheek of purity no blush , save that of pleasure — the mother may sing them to her child , the bride to her young husband . “ ‘ Festus ’ has an eloquent reply to such as hold love a theme unworthy the true bard :— ‘ Poets are all who love — who feel great truths , And tell them ; and the truth of truths is LOVE . ’ “ The muse of Morris was Poesy 's own ‘ summer child . ’ Hope , love , and happiness , sunny-winged fancies and golden-hued imaginings , have nested in his heart like birds . “ His verse does not cause one to tremble and turn pale — it charms and refreshes . It does not ‘ posses us like a passion ’ — it steals upon us like a spell . It does not storm the heart like an armed host — it is like the visitation of gentle spirits , ‘ Coming and going with a musical lightness . ’ It is not a turbulent mountain-torrent , hurling itself down rocky places — it is a silver stream , gliding through quiet valleys , in whose waves the sweet stars are mirrored , on whose bosom the water-lilies sleep . “ Now and then there steals in a strain of sadness , like the plaint of a bereaved bird in a garden of roses ; but it is a tender , not an OPPRESIVE sadness , and we know that the rainbow beauty of the verse could only be born in the wedlock of smiles and tears . In a word , his lays are not ‘ night and storm and darkness ’ — they are morning and music and sunshine . “ It were idle at this time to quote or comment upon all those songs of Morris best known and oftenest sung . It would be introducing to my readers old friends who took lodgings in their memories ‘ long time ago . ’ In reference to them , I would only remark their peculiar adaptedness to popular taste , the keen discrimination , the nice tact , or , to use one of Sir James Mackintosh 's happy expressions , the ‘ FEELosophy ’ with which the poet has interlaced them with the heart-strings of a nation . “ ‘ A Rock in the Wilderness ’ is an ode that any poet might be proud to own . It is much in the style of Campbell — chaste , devotional , ‘ beautiful exceedingly . ’ I know nothing of the kind more musically sweet than the serenade ‘'Tis now the promised hour ’ — the first line in especial — ‘ The fountains serenade the flowers , Upon their silver lute — And nestled in their leafy bowers , The forest birds are mute . ’ “ Many an absent lover must have blessed our lyrist for giving voice to his own yearning affection , half sad with that delicate jealousy which is no wrong to the loved one , in the song ‘ When other friends are round thee . ’</p>

    <p>“ ‘ The Bacchanal ’ — if our language boasts a lovelier ballad than this , it has never met my eye . The story of the winning , the betraying and the breaking of a woman 's heart , was never told more touchingly . ‘ The Dismissed ’ is in a peculiar vein of rich and quiet humor . I would commend it to the entire class of rejected lovers as containing the truest philosophy . ‘ Lines after the manner of the olden time ’ remind one of Sir John Suckling . They are ‘ sunned o'er with love ’ — their subject , by the way . ‘ I never have been false to thee ’ was an emanation from the FEMININE nature of the minstrel alone . Who does not believe the poet gifted with duality of soul ? ‘ Think of me , my own beloved , ’ and ‘ Rosabel , ’ are the throbbings of a lover 's breast , set to music ; and ‘ One balmy summer night , Mary , ’ ‘ The heart that owns thy tyrant sway , ’ and ‘ When I was in my teens , ’ the distillation of the subtlest sweets lodged in the innermost cells of all flowers dedicated to love . “ I come now to my favorite , ‘ Where Hudson 's wave ; ’ a poem which I never read but that it glows upon my lip and heart , and leaves the air of my thoughts tremulous with musical vibrations . What a delicious gush of parental feeling ! How daintily and delicately move the ‘ fitly chose words , ’ tripping along like silver sandaled fairies . “ ‘ Land-Ho ! ’ and the ‘ Western Refrain ’ thrill one gloriously . ‘ The Cottager 's Welcome ’ would of itself carry the poet 's name to the next age , and the ‘ Croton Ode ’ keep his bays green with a perpetual baptism . The last-mentioned is fresh and sparkling as its subject , and displays much of the imaginative faculty . “ ‘ Oh , a merry life does the hunter lead , ’ rolled up the tenth wave of Morris-ian popularity at the West . It stirs the hunter 's heart like a bugle blast — it rings out clear as a rifle-crack on a hunting morning . “ General Morris has recently published some songs , which have all the grace , melody , and touching sweetness of his earlier lays . But as these have been artistically set to music , and are yet in the first season of popularity — are lying on the pianos and ‘ rolling over the bright lip ’ of all song-dom , they call for no further mention here . “ I think I cannot better close this somewhat broken and imperfect notice , than by referring to one of the earlier songs of Morris , which , more than all others , perhaps , has endeared him to his native land . ‘ Home from travel ’ is a simple , hearty , manly embodiment of the true spirit of patriotism , a sentiment which throbs like a strong pulse beneath our poet 's light and graceful verse , and needs but the inspiration of ‘ stirring times ’ to prompt to deeds of heroic valor , like the lays of the ancient bards , or the ‘ Chansons ’ of Beranger . ” The biography of Morris would not be complete without a word from Willis . We have a dash of his pencil in the following letter to the editor of “ Graham 's Magazine ":— “ My Dear Sir : To ask me for my idea of General Morris , is like asking the left hand 's opinion of the dexterity of the right . I have lived so long with the ‘ Brigadier ’ — know him so intimately — worked so constantly at the same rope , and thought so little of ever separating from him ( except by precedence of ferriage over the Styx ) , that it is hard to shove him from me to the perspective distance — hard to shut my own partial eyes , and look at him through other people 's . I will try , however ; and , as it is done with but one foot off from the treadmill of my ceaseless vocation , you will excuse both abruptness and brevity . “ Morris is the best-known poet of the country , by acclamation , not by criticism . He is just what poets would be if they sang , like birds , without criticism ; and it is a peculiarity of his fame , that it seems as regardless of criticism , as a bird in the air . Nothing can stop a song of his . It is very easy to say that they are easy to do . They have a momentum , somehow , that it is difficult for others to give , and that speeds them to the far goal of popularity — the best proof consisting in the fact that he can , at any moment , get fifty dollars for a song unread , when the whole remainder of the American Parnassus could not sell one to the same buyer for a shilling .</p>

    <docImprint>“ It may , or may not , be one secret of his popularity , but it is the truth — that Morris 's heart is at the level of most other people 's , and his poetry flows out by that door . He stands breast-high in the common stream of sympathy , and the fine oil of his poetic feeling goes from him upon an element it is its nature to float upon , and which carries it safe to other bosoms , with little need of deep diving or high flying . His sentiments are simple , honest , truthful , and familiar ; his language is pure and eminently musical , and he is prodigally full of the poetry of every-day feeling . These are days when poets try experiments ; and while others succeed by taking the world 's breath away with flights and plunges , Morris uses his feet to walk quietly with nature . Ninety-nine people in a hundred , taken as they come in the census , would find more to admire in Morris 's songs , than in the writings of any other American poet ; and that is a parish in the poetical episcopate , well worthy a wise man 's nurture and prizing . “ As for the man — Morris , my friend — I can hardly venture to ‘ burn incense on his moustache , ’ as the French say — write his praises under his very nose — but as far off as<settlement>Philadelphia</settlement>, you may pay the proper tribute to his loyal nature and manly excellencies . His personal qualities have made him universally popular ; but this overflow upon the world does not impoverish him for his friends . I have outlined a true poet , and a fine fellow — fill up the picture to your liking . Yours , very truly ,</docImprint>

    <docImprint>In<date>1825</date>, General Morris wrote the drama of “ Briercliff , ” a play , in five acts , founded upon events of the American Revolution . It was performed forty nights in succession ; and the manager paid him for it $ 3 , 500 — a solid proof of its attractive popularity . It has never been published . Prior , and subsequent to this period , his pen was actively engaged upon various literary and dramatic works . He wrote a number of the “ Welcomes to Lafayette , ” and songs and ballads , which were universally popular , besides many prologues and addresses . In<date>1842</date>, he wrote an opera for Mr. C. E. Horn , called the “ Maid of Saxony , ” which was performed fourteen nights , with great success , at the Park Theatre . The press of the city , generally , awarded to this opera the highest commendation . From the period when General Morris commenced his career as a writer , his pen has been constantly employed in writing poems , songs , ballads , and prose sketches . In<date>1840</date>, the Appletons published an edition of his poems , beautifully illustrated by Weir &amp; Chapman ; in<date>1842</date>, Paine &amp; Burgess published his songs and ballads ; and in<date>1853</date>, Scribner 's edition , illustrated by Weir and Darley , appeared . This last beautiful work has had an immense sale . They were highly commended by the press throughout the country , and these and other editions have had large sales . A portion of his prose writings , under the title of “ The Little Frenchman and his Water-Lots , ” were published by Lea &amp; Blanchard , which edition has been followed by others , enlarged by the author . General Morris has edited a number of works ; among them are the “ Atlantic Club Book , ” published by the Harpers ; “ The Song-Writers of<country>America</country>, ” by Linen &amp; Ferin ; “ National Melodies , ” by Horn &amp; Davis ; and , in connection with Mr. Willis , “ The Prose and Poetry of Europe and<country>America</country>, ” a standard work of great value . In<date>1844</date>, in connection with Mr. Willis , he established a beautiful weekly paper , called the “ New Mirror , ” which , in consequence of the cover and engravings , was taxed by the post-office department a postage equal to the subscription price ; and not being able to obtain a just reduction from Mr. Wickliffe , then post-master-general , the proprietors discontinued its publication , after a year and a half , notwithstanding it had attained a circulation of ten thousand copies . The daily “ Evening Mirror ” was next commenced , and continued for one year by Morris &amp; Willis . A few months after withdrawing from the “ Evening Mirror , ” General Morris began the publication of the “ National Press and Home Journal ; ” but as many mistook its object from its name , the first part of its title was discontinued ; and in November ,<date>1846</date>( Mr. Willis having again joined his old friend and associate ) , appeared the first number of the “ Home Journal , ” a weekly paper , published in<settlement>New York</settlement>every Saturday , which is edited with taste , spirit , and ability , and which has a circulation of many thousand copies . General Morris is still in the prime and vigor of life , and it is not unlikely that the public will yet have much to admire from his pen , and which will , without doubt , place him still higher in the niche of fame . His residence is chiefly at Undercliff , his country seat , on the banks of the Hudson , near Cold Spring , surrounded by the most lovely and beautiful scenery in nature , which can not fail to keep the muse alive within him , and tune the minstrel to further and still higher efforts . Although he possesses abilities which eminently qualify him for public station , his literary taste and habits have , in spite of the strenuous solicitations of his friends , led him to prefer the retirement of private life . This , however , does not prevent his taking an active interest in all questions of public good ; and the city of<settlement>New York</settlement>is greatly indebted to his vigorous aid for many of her most beautiful and permanent improvements . We can not close this sketch without adverting to the following incident , which occurred in the British House of Commons :— “ Mr. Cagley , a member from Yorkshire , ” says the “<settlement>London</settlement>Times , ” “ Concluded a long speech in favor of protection , by quoting the ballad of ‘ Woodman , spare that tree ’ ( which was received with applause of the whole house ) , the ‘ tree ’ according to Mr. Cagley , being the ‘ Constitution , ’ and Sir Robert Peel the ‘ woodman , ’ about to cut it down . ” What poet could desire a more gratifying compliment to his genius ?</docImprint>

     <p>“ Love me !— No .— He never loved me ! ” Else he 'd sooner die than stain One so fond as he has proved me With the hollow world 's disdain . False one , go — my doom is spoken , And the spell that bound me broken . Wed him !— Never .— He has lost me !— Tears !— Well , let them flow !— His bride ? No .— The struggle life may cost me ! But he 'll find that I have pride ! Love is not an idle flower , Blooms and dies the self-same hour . Title , land , and broad dominion , With himself to me he gave ; Stooped to earth his spirit 's pinion , And became my willing slave ! Knelt and prayed until he won me — Looks he coldly upon me ? Ingrate !— Never sure was maiden Deeply wronged as I . With grief My true breast is overladen — Tears afford me no relief — Every nerve is strained and aching , And my very heart is breaking ! Love I him ?— Thus scorned and slighted — Thrown , like worthless weed , apart — Hopes and feelings seared and blighted — Love him ?— Yes , with all my heart ! With a passion superhuman — Constancy , “ thy name is woman . ” Love , nor time , nor mood , can fashion — Love ?— Idolatry 's the word To speak the broadest , deepest passion , Ever woman 's heart hath stirred ! Vain to still the mind 's desires , Which consume like hidden fires ! Wrecked and wretched , lost and lonely , Crushed by grief 's oppressive weight With a prayer for Clifford only , I resign me to my fate . Chains that bind the soul I 've proven Strong as they were iron woven . Deep the wo that fast is sending From my cheek its healthful bloom ; Sad my thoughts as willows bending O'er the borders of the tomb ! Without Clifford , not a blessing In the world is worth possessing . Wealth !— a straw within the balance Opposed to love , ‘ twill strike the beam : Kindred , friendship , beauty , talents ?— All to love as nothing seem ; Weigh love against all else together , And solid gold against a feather . Hope is flown — away disguises Naught but death relief can give — For the love he little prizes Can not cease , and Julia live ! Soon my thread of life will sever — Clifford , fare thee well — for ever !</p>

       <l n="2">What scene of splendor — conjured here to-night !</l>
       <l n="3">What voices murmur , and what glances gleam !</l>
       <l n="4">Sure ‘ tis some flattering unsubstantial dream .</l>
       <l n="5">The house is crowded — everybody 's here</l>
       <l n="6">For beauty famous , or to science dear ;</l>
       <l n="7">Doctors and lawyers , judges , belles , and beaux ,</l>

       <l n="11">( A fairy change — ah , pray continue it . )</l>
       <l n="12">Gray heads are here too , listening to my rhymes ,</l>
       <l n="13">Full of the spirit of departed times ;</l>
       <l n="14">Grave men and studious , strangers to my sight ,</l>

       <l n="49">Round every opening floweret 's tender head ,</l>
       <l n="50">With smiles as kind his genial radiance throws</l>
       <l n="51">To cheer the sadness of the fading rose :</l>
       <l n="52">Thus he , whose merit claims this dazzling crowd ,</l>
       <l n="53">Points to the past , and has his claims allowed ;</l>
       <l n="54">Looks brightly forth , his faithful journey done ,</l>

     <p>SONG . The life for me is a soldier 's life ! With that what glories come ! The notes of the spirit-stirring fife , The roll of the battle-drum ; The brilliant array , the bearing high , The plumed warriors ’ tramp ; The streaming banners that flout the sky , The gleaming pomp of the camp .</p>
     <p>CHORUS . A soldier 's life is the life for me ! With that what glories come ! The notes of the spirit-stirring fife , The roll of the battle-drum !</p>
     <p>HAROLD . So , corporal , at last we are to have a muster of the combined forces of the kingdom .</p>
     <p>CORPORAL . Yes , the king is never so happy as when he has all his children , as he calls US , about him .</p>
     <p>HAROLD . And plaguy good he takes of his CHILDREN ! He looks after our domestic as well as our public interests ! It was a strange whim in old Fritz to offer each of his soldiers one of the factory girls for a wife !</p>
     <p>CORPORAL . I wonder the old hero does not marry some of them himself .</p>
     <p>HAROLD . He would rather look after his soldiers than meddle with the fancies of the women — and at his age too !</p>
     <p>CORPORAL . Nonsense ! The king is a boy — a mere boy — of seventy ! But he does meddle with the women sometimes .</p>
     <p>HAROLD . Say you so ?</p>
     <p>CORPORAL . Ay , and old ones too . It was but the other day that he pensioned a poor widow , whose only son fell in a skirmish at his side . Heaven bless his old cocked hat !</p>
     <p>HAROLD . Yes is it not singular that one so mindful of the rights of old women should compel the young ones to toil as they do in the factory ?</p>
     <p>CORPORAL . Tush , tush , man !— that 's none of your concern , nor mine . What have we to do with state affairs ?</p>
     <p>HAROLD . Right , corporal ; and it 's not worth while for us to trouble our heads about other people 's business .</p>
     <p>CORPORAL . You 're a sensible fellow —</p>

     <p>CORPORAL . That 's personal !</p>
     <p>HAROLD . I mean it to be so . What the devil do you wear it for ?</p>
     <p>CORPORAL . To gratify a whim . I like this riband . It was a present from an old sweetheart of mine . Look what a jaunty air it gives one !— and where 's the harm of keeping up appearances ?—</p>
     <p>HAROLD . What silly vanity ! But let me give you a piece of advice : beware of the scrutiny of the king — he has an eye like a hawk , old as he is ; and if he should happen to spy your watch-riband —</p>
     <p>CORPORAL . Pooh , pooh !— he would not notice such a trifle .— But who comes yonder ? That Hungarian Karl . Let 's make way for him .— He 's a fellow I do n't fancy . What a man to woo and win Sophia Mansfield !</p>
     <p>HAROLD . He 'll never win her , woo her as he may . Count Laniska will look to that .</p>

     <p>KARL . What has that to do with the matter ? Women are often perverse , and not always the best judges of their own welfare ; and you know she MUST be mine —</p>

     <p>KARL . Why not ? Sophia is the only woman I ever loved : and now that I have her sure , think you I will resign her ?</p>

     <p>KARL . Tyrant !</p>
     <p>COUNT . Yes . Man was created to cherish woman , not to oppress her ; and he is the worst of tyrants who would injure that sex whom heave ordains it his duty to protect .</p>
     <p>KARL . Apply you this to the king ?</p>
     <p>COUNT . To the king , or to any HE in Christendom , who would use his power to oppress the unfortunate ! But come , sir , we will not dispute about a hasty word — we have higher duties to perform .</p>
     <p>KARL . True , count ; we oppose our weapons to the enemies of our country , not the bosoms of our friends . I say OUR country ; for , although you were born in Poland , and I in Hungary , Frederick has made Prussia almost as dear to us as our native land , TYRANT though he may be .— But we will not quarrel about a single captive , when the king has placed so many at the disposal of those who fight his battles .

     <p>COUNTESS ( to WEDGEWOOD . ) It was very kind in my correspondent , Mr. Wedgewood , to introduce a gentleman of your celebrity to my chateau .</p>
     <p>WEDGEWOOD . You do me honor , madam . We Englishmen are plain-spoken people . We are not unlike our earthenware — delf and common clay mixed together .

( Aside . ) Not a bad compliment to myself , and metaphorically odd !</p>
     <p>COUNTESS . Your reply reminds me of the object of your visit . The Prussians are very proud of the manufactory which has claimed the attention of the king .</p>
     <p>WEDGEWOOD . Oh , how I long to see the great Frederick !</p>
     <p>COUNTESS . You will like him , I am confident .</p>
     <p>WEDGEWOOD . I do n't know that . I do n't at all fancy his edict .— What ! marry a parcel of handsome , innocent , industrious girls to his great whiskered horse-guards , whether they will or no ? It 's a piece of moral turpitude — an insult to common sense — and infamously odd —</p>
     <p>FREDERICA ( advancing . ) Have a care , Mr. Wedgewood — have a care how you talk about the king . He possesses a sort of magical ubiquity — and is here , there , and every where at the same moment .</p>
     <p>WEDGEWOOD . How does he manage that ?</p>
     <p>FREDERICA . He wanders about in secrecy and disguise — enters all kinds of mansions — and often over-hears conversations that were never intended for the court . By this means , it is said , he gathers information from every nook and corner of his kingdom .</p>
     <p>WEDGEWOOD . Strange kind of hocus-pocus work for a monarch !— Peripatetically odd !</p>
     <p>ALBERT . I have been told that he knows more of the character and condition of his subjects and soldiers than they do themselves .</p>

     <p>( GERTRUDE and HANS stand aside . Grand march . Enter a corps of Grenadiers and other troops , who form on the right of the stage . Roll of drums . The troops present arms . Enter FREDERICK , in a furious passion , followed by general and staff Officers , and Count LANISKA . The KING acknowledges the salute , lifts his hat , and puts it on again furiously . HAROLD and Corporal are in the ranks of the Grenadiers . Throughout the scene the KING speaks hurriedly . )</p>
     <p>KING . General !</p>
     <p>FIRST GENERAL . Your Majesty .</p>
     <p>KING . How comes it there is such a lack of discipline in your division ? Disband THAT regiment at once , and draft a few of the men from the right wing into other regiments ordered for immediate service ! The sooner THEY are shot the better !</p>
     <p>FIRST GENERAL . Yes , sire . [ Exit .</p>
     <p>KING . Generals — most of you have served the greater part of your lives with me . We have grown gray-headed in the service of our country , and we therefore know best ourselves the dangers , difficulties , and glory in which we have shared . While we maintain the discipline of the army , we may defy any power that Europe can march against us — relax that , and we become an easy prey to the spoiler .</p>
     <p>SECOND GENERAL . Your majesty shall have no cause of complain in the future .</p>
     <p>KING . Make sure of that !— Soldiers , I rely in my operations entirely upon your well-known zeal in my service , and I shall acknowledge it with gratitude as long as I live ; but at the same time I require of you that you look upon it as your most sacred duty to show kindness and mercy to all prisoners that the fortunes of war may throw in your power .</p>
     <p>SECOND GENERAL . That duty , sire , you have taught us all our lives .</p>

We humbly beg to know what Your Majesty 's pleasure is with regard to the punishment of so unparalleled and atrocious an offender ?</p>
     <p>KING . If the prisoner has sinned against heaven , and is not a fool or a madman , he will make his peace with it without delay . This is a Power ( taking off his hat — all the characters make their obeisance ) that kings themselves must bow to in reverential awe . ( Resumes his hat . )</p>

On the left hand is a row of long , old-fashioned windows , with painting-screens so arranged as to let the light fall obliquely on the tables beneath ; at which the FACTORY GIRLS are seated , employed in painting various articles of porcelain . SOPHIA MANSFIELD is seated at the table nearest the audience . On the right are separate tables , at which GIRLS are employed mixing and grinding colors . In the center of the stage is a small platform , on which a number of painted vases , ready for the oven , are placed . KARL is engaged in examining them . At the rear of the stage is the entrance to the room — a large open door — on each side of which are rows of shelves , filled with vases , bowls , plates , jars , mantel ornaments , and the like , put there to dry . The whole representing the painting-room of the Royal Porcelain Factory . Through the doors the furnaces are seen , on which the porcelain is placed to set the colors , and which several WORKMEN are attending . The curtain rises slowly to the music .</p>

     <p>WEDGEWOOD ( looking around , and speaking enthusiastically as he enters . ) Admirable , upon my word ! Every department better than the last , and this the best of all ! Never saw anything like it . The colors brilliant — the designs exquisitely classical — “ a place for everything , and everything in its place ! ”</p>
     <p>COUNT . Whatever His Majesty constructs , whether a fortress or a factory , is perfect in all its details .</p>
     <p>WEDGEWOOD . Yet look around , and read your monarch 's history in the eyes of these prisoners of war . Observe that picture of melancholy ( pointing to SOPHIA , who , during the scene , has been leaning dejectedly on her hand .— KARL standing by her side . ) How reluctantly she pursues her task ! Our English manufacturers work in quite another manner , for they are free !</p>
     <p>KARL . And are free men or free women never indisposed ?— or do you Englishmen blame your king whenever any of his subjects turn pale ? The woman at whom you are looking is evidently ill .</p>
     <p>WEDGEWODD . The fie upon your inhumanity for making a poor , sick girl work when she seems scarcely able to hold up her head ! ( Aside . ) I do n't half like that fellow . Villainously odd .</p>
     <p>ALBERT ( to SOPHIA . ) My poor girl , what is the matter with you . The overseer says that , since you came here , you have done nothing worthy of your pencil . Yet this charming piece ( pointing to an ornament on her painting ) — which was brought from Saxony is of your design — is it not ?</p>
     <p>SOPHIA . Yes , sir , it was my misfortune to paint it . If the king had never seen or liked it , I should now be —</p>
     <p>ALBERT . In Saxony ; but forget that country , and you may be happy in this .</p>
     <p>SOPHIA . I can not forget it !— I can not forget everybody that I ever loved . Ask not a Saxon woman to forget her country !</p>
     <p>ALBERT . Whom do you love in Saxony now ?</p>
     <p>SOPHIA . Whom do I NOT love in Saxony ? I have a brother there , whom I have not seen since childhood . He was at college when I was carried off from the cottage in which we both were born . He is ignorant of my fate . ( She regards ALBERT with great attention , and examines his features minutely . )</p>
     <p>ALBERT . Why do you gaze upon me so intently ?</p>
     <p>SOPHIA . I know not why , sir ; but you seemed even now a dear heart-cherished one , whom I have wished for long and anxiously .</p>
     <p>ALBERT . Think me that one , and trust me .</p>
     <p>SOPHIA . I will — for there 's a cherub nestling in my heart which whispers , “ You are here to save me ! ” ( ALBERT leads her to her task , which she resumes in great dejection of spirits . )</p>

     <p>KING . Those who have the command of motives , and know their power , have also the command of all that the arts , or what is called a genius for the arts , can produce . The human mind and human ingenuity are much the same in Italy , England , and Prussia . Then why should not we have a Prussian as well as a Wedgewood or a Barbarini vase ? We shall see . I do not understand mon metier de roi , if I can not call forth talents where I know them to exist . ( To KARL . ) And so the count denounced me for a tyrant , did he , Karl ?</p>

( Seeing the KING , who is in the act of taking snuff . ) Ah , use snuff , my old boy ?— Odd !— Thank you for a pinch . ( Takes a pinch sans ceremonie , and without the King 's consent .

     <p>The stage represents part of the Castle of Spandau , and is arranged as follows : On the left , is a large rock ; above which , in the distance , is the Tower . A large grated door opens upon a platform , surrounded by iron railing .— COUNT LANISKA is discovered leaning upon them . On the right , is an arched cell , with part of the wall jutting from the side , behind which is a secret door . Above this is a fine view of an open country , and a clear , blue , starlight sky . SOPHIA is seated in the cell , at a table .— The whole scene is so managed that , while the AUDIENCE have a full view of everything , the PRISONERS , although they hear , can not see each other .— Time , near midnight .— The curtain rises slowly to music .</p>
     <p>DUET — SOPHIA and COUNT .</p>
     <p>SOPHIA . This gloomy cell is my abode at last ; The sole reward for all my perils past . ‘ Tis strange that love within the breast should dwell , When hope , dejected , bids the heart farewell !</p>
     <p>COUNT . What sounds are these ? No human form is near , And yet that well-known voice I faintly hear , ‘ Twas sure the fancied music of the mind , Whose breathings mingled with the midnight wind .</p>
     <p>BOTH . Yes !— ‘ Tis lost !— ‘ Tis gone !— Hark ! it comes again , Like distant echoes of a melting strain : In melody { her / his } spirit floats around !— That voice !— These walls are vocal with the sound . I hear its music near me still !— ‘ Tis there ! Sure ‘ tis some gentle spirit of the air !</p>
     <p>( During the duet , the moon has been gradually rising , and the light falls through the grated windows of the Prison . )</p>
     <p>( enter JAILOR , from the Tower , to COUNT LANISKA . )</p>
     <p>JAILOR . Count Laniska — a friend , with an order form the king .</p>
     <p>COUNT . I attend him . [ Exit Count LANISKA .</p>
     <p>( Jailor closes the iron door over the grated window , locks it , and retires . )</p>
     <p>SOPHIA . ‘ Twas but a dream !— ‘ Tis past , and all is still again !</p>
     <p>[ The bell in the tower strikes twelve</p>
     <p>BRAVURA — SOPHIA Hark ! ‘ tis the deep-toned midnight bell , That bids a sad and long farewell To the departed hour ; How like a dirge its music falls Within these cold and dreary walls , Where stern misfortunes lower !</p>

     <p>HAROLD . The populace are in a ferment at the indignity offered to our beloved monarch , and demand the instant execution of the prisoners .</p>
     <p>KING . Well , well ; say on .</p>
     <p>HAROLD . The multitude crowd every avenue to the palace , and the chateau of the countess ; and the royal guards are under arms to preserve the public peace .</p>
     <p>KING . So , so , so , so —</p>
     <p>COUNTESS . O Heaven ! what will become of us ?</p>
     <p>KING ( proudly . ) Have you not the king 's protection ? I will appear among my children , who are so apprehensive about my safety , that they sometimes forget themselves , and become a little unruly . They will be satisfied when they hear and see their father . ( Seeing the COUNTESS look dejected . ) Do not droop madam ; your GUILTY SON shall have a fair and impartial trial . ( Taking her hand — To ALBERT sternly . ) Look to it , sir ; for if you fail , you know what follows ! ( Exit FREDERICK and COUNTESS — Immense cheering and beating of drums without . )</p>
     <p>WEDGEWOOD . Bravo ! He 's a trump .— Bless me ! a popular commotion !— No matter — I am crier of the court ! Let me catch any of the little boys making a noise in the halls of justice — that 's all ! I 'll make the king himself mind his P 's and Q 's , if he dares to interfere with OUR grave deliberations ! I will act as becomes my station . His Majesty has a jewel in me , and I 'll convince him that authority in my hands is a knock-down argument — so-fist-ically odd !</p>
     <p>SONG — WEDGEWOOD . That law 's the perfection of reason , No one in his senses denies ; Yet here is a trial for treason Will puzzle the wigs of the wise . The lawyers who bring on the action On one single point will agree , Though proved to their own satisfaction That tweedle-dum 's NOT tweedle-dee !</p>

     </lg>
     <p>Discovered . The whole stage is thrown open , and represents the Hall of the Palace at Potsdam , arranged as a court-room . On a carpeted platform is the royal seat of state , occupied by three JUDGES . On the right and left of them are cushioned seats for the KING and his retinue , and OFFICERS of state . In front of the judgement-seat is a large center-table , on which are various law-books and the Prussian Vase . Around the table are suitable places for the ADVOCATES in the cause . On each side are elevated benches , occupied by the GIRLS of the Factory , behind whom are stationed platoons of the ROYAL GUARDS . At the end of the benches on the right is the jury-box , with twelve JURORS , and the desk of the CRIER , on which is a small mallet . Around the whole stage is a large gallery , crowded with the CITIZENS of Potsdam .— The entire scene is intended to represent an English Criminal Court of Law of the olden time , in full costume , with scarlet robes , ermine gowns , etc .— The following CHARACTERS are discovered in their respective places : BARON ALTENBERG , the ATTORNEY-GENERAL and ADVOCATE for the crown ; the WORKMEN of the Factory , as WITNESSES ; the JAILOR , HANS , GERTRUDE , HAROLD , and CORPORAL ; COUNT LANISKA , guarded , attended by the COUNTESS and FREDERICA ; SOPHIA MANSFIELD , guarded , and attended by Factory-GIRLS ; ALBERT , as ADVOCATE for the PRISONERS , and WEDGEWOOD , as CRIER of the Court ; OFFICERS of state , LADIES of the Court , PORTERS of the Hall , and the KING .— This scene is accompanied by the ORCHESTRA .— Music as the scene opens —</p>
     <p>CHORUS . With mercy let justice To mortals be given , For Justice and Mercy Are twin-born in heaven !</p>
     <p>( As BARON ALTENBERG rises , WEDGEWOOD says , in a subdued tone of voice , and very respectfully . )</p>
     <p>WEDGEWOOD . Silence in the court !</p>
     <p>ALTENBERG . May it please your lordships , these facts are not denied : the inscription in the handwriting of the count ; his free access to the factory ; his frequent use of the word TYRANT when speaking of the king ; his earnest interest in the Saxon maid ; her love for the count , and her opposition to the will of our most gracious sovereign for allotting her to the overseer as his bride : and they all unite in establishing their crime , the punishment of which is DEATH . Had not His Majesty chanced to wipe off , with his own handkerchief , the blue paint which concealed the word TYRANT , the vase would have been sent to Paris , the king and people disgraced , and the criminals safe in Saxony . Yes , gentlemen ( to the JURY ,) this splendid ornament , which is to be known to all future ages as “ The Prussian Vase , ” is defaced with the treasonable inscription — “ To Frederick the Great Tyrant . ”</p>
     <p>KING ( rising in excitement , and forgetting himself . ) Yes , soldiers and subjects , friends and children , this word is applied to ME — to your FATHER — by these base ingrates here !—</p>

    <p n="5">Woodman , Spare That Tree ! ( page 64 . )</p>
    <p n="6">Riding out of town a few days since , in company with a friend , who was once the expectant heir of the largest estate in America , but over whose worldly prospects a blight has recently come , he invited me to turn down a little romantic woodland pass not far from Bloomingdale . “ Your object ? ” inquired I . “ Merely to look once more at an old tree planted by my grandfather , near a cottage that was once my father 's . ” — “ The place is yours , then ? ” said I . “ No , my poor mother sold it ; ” and I observed a slight quiver of the lip , at the recollection of that circumstance . “ Dear mother ! ” resumed my companion , “ we passed many happy , HAPPY days , in that old cottage ; but it is nothing to me now — father , mother , sisters , cottage — all are gone ! ” — and a paleness over-spread his fine countenance , and a moisture came to his eyes , as he spoke . After a moment 's pause , he added : “ Do n't think me foolish . I do n't know how it is , I never ride out but I turn down this lane to look at that old tree . I have a thousand recollections about it , and I always greet it as a familiar and well-remembered friend . In the by-gone summer-time it was a friend indeed . Under its branches I often listened to the good counsel of my parents , and had SUCH gambols with my sisters ! Its leaves are all off now , so you wo n't see it to advantage , for it is a glorious old fellow in summer ; but I like it full as well in winter-time . ” These words were scarcely uttered , when my companion cried out , “ There it is ? ” Near the tree stood an old man , with his coat off , sharpening an ax . He was the occupant of the cottage . “ What do you intend doing ? ” asked my friend with great anxiety . “ What is that to you ? ” was the blunt reply . “ You are not going to cut that tree down , surely ? ” — “ Yes , but I am though , ” said the woodman . “ What for ? ” inquired my companion , almost choked with emotion . “ What for ? Why , because I think proper to do so . What for ? I like that ! Well , I 'll tell you what for . This tree makes my dwelling unhealthy ; it stands too near the house : prevents the moisture from exhaling , and renders us liable to fever-and-ague . ” — “ Who told you that ? ” — “ Dr. S — -  . ” — “ Have you any other reason for wishing to cut it down ? ” — “ Yes , I am getting old ; the woods are a great way off , and this tree is of some value to me to burn . ” He was soon convinced , however , that the story about the fever-and-ague was a mere fiction , for there never had been a case of that disease in the neighborhood ; and then was asked what the tree was worth for firewood . “ Why , when it is down , about ten dollars . ” “ Suppose I make you a present of that amount , will you let it stand ? ” — “ Yes . ” — “ You are sure of that ? ” — “ Positive . ” — “ Then give me a bond to that effect . ” I drew it up ; it was witnessed by his daughter ; the money was paid , and we left the place with an assurance from the young girl , who looked as smiling and beautiful as Hebe , that the tree should stand as long as she lived . We returned to the road , and pursued our ride . These circumstances made a strong impression upon my mind , and furnished me with materials for the song I herewith send you .— Extract from a Letter to Henry Russell , the Vocalist , dated New York , February 1 , 1837 .</p>
    <p n="7">The Chieftain 's Daughter ( page 78 . )</p>
    <p n="8">“ Every part of the brief but glorious life of Pocahontas is calculated to produce a thrill of admiration , and to reflect the highest honor on her name . The most memorable event of her life is this recorded : After a long consultation among the Indians , the fate of Captain Smith , who was the leader of the first colony in Virginia , was decided . The conclave resumed their silent gravity . Two huge stones were placed near the water 's edge ; Smith was lashed to them , and his head was laid down , as a preparation for beating out his brains with war-clubs . Powhattan raised the fatal instrument , and the savage multitude with their blood-stained weapons stood near their king , silently waiting the prisoner 's last moment . But Smith was not destined to thus perish . Pocahontas , the beloved daughter of the king , rushed forward , fell upon her knees , and , with tears and entreaties , prayed that the victim might be spared . The royal savage rejected her suit , and commanded her to leave Smith to his fate . Grown frantic at the failure of her supplications , Pocahontas threw her arms about Smith , and laid her head on his , her raven hair falling around his neck and shoulders , declaring she would perish with or save him . The Indians gasped for breath , fearing that Powhatan would slay his child for taking such a deep interest in the fate of one he considered his deadliest foe . But human nature is the same everywhere ; the war-club dropped from the monarch 's hand — his brow relaxed — his heart softened ; and , as he raised his brave daughter to his bosom , and kissed her forehead , he reversed his decree , and directed Smith to be set at liberty ! Whether the regard of this glorious girl for Smith ever reached the feeling of love , is not known . No favor was ever expected in return . ‘ I ask nothing of Captain Smith , ’ said she , in an interview she afterward had with him in England , ‘ in recompense for what I have done , but the boon of living in his memory . ’ John Randolph was a lineal descendant of this noble woman , and was wont to pride himself upon the honor of his descent . Pocahontas died in the twenty-second year of her age . ” — sketches of Virginia .</p>
    <p n="9">Song of Marion 's Men ( page 82 . )</p>
    <p n="10">“ Sallie St. Clair was a beautiful , dark-eyed Creole girl . The whole treasury of her love was lavished upon Sergeant Jasper , who , on one occasion , had the good fortune to save her life . The prospect of their separation almost maddened her . To sever her long , jetty ringlets from her exquisite head — to dress in male attire — to enroll herself in the corps to which he belonged , and follow his fortunes in the wars , unknown to him — was a resolution no sooner conceived than taken . In the camp she attracted no particular attention , except on the night before battle , when she was noticed bending over his couch , like a good and gentle spirit , as if listening to his dreams . The camp was surprised , and a fierce conflict ensued . The lovers were side by side in the thickest of the fight ; but , endeavoring to turn away a lance aimed at the heart of Jasper , the poor girl received it in her own , and fell bleeding at his feet . After the victory , her name and sex were discovered , and there was not a dry eye in the corps when Sallie St. Clair was laid in her grave , near the river Santee , in a green , shady nook , that looked as if it had been stolen out of Paradise . ” — Tales of Marion 's Men .</p>
    <p n="11">Janet McRea ( page 83 . )</p>
    <p n="12">“ We seated ourselves in the shade of a large pine-tree , and drank of a spring that gurgled beneath it . The Indians gave a groan , and turned their faces from the water . They would not drink of the spring , nor eat in the shade of the tree ; but retired to a ledge of rocks at no great distance . I ventured to approach them and inquire the cause of their strange conduct . One of the Indians said , in a deep and solemn tone : ‘ That place is bad for the red-man ; the blood of an innocent woman , not of our enemies , rests upon that spot !— She was there murdered . The red-man 's word had been pledged for her safety ; but the evil spirit made him forget it . She lies buried there . No one avenged her murder , and the Great Spirit was angry . That water will make us more thirsty , and that shade will scorch us . The stain of blood is on our hands , and we know not how to wipe it out . It still rests upon us , do what we will . ’ I could get no more from them ; they were silent , even for Indians . It was the death of Miss McRea they alluded to . She was betrothed to a young American by the name of Jones , who had taken sides with the British , and become a captain of their service . The lovers , however , had managed to keep up a correspondence ; and he was informed , after a battle in which he distinguished himself for his bravery , that his inamorata was concealed in a house a few miles from Sandy-Hill . As it was dangerous for him to take his horse to her residence and bring her to his tent in safety . He urged her , in his letter , not to hesitate a moment in putting herself under their protection ; and the voice of a lover is law to a confiding woman . They proceeded on their journey , and stopped to rest under a large pine-tree near a spring — the one at which we drank . Here they were met by another party of Indians , also sent by the impatient lover , when a quarrel arouse about her which terminated in her assassination . One of the Indians pulled the poor girl from her horse ; and another struck his tomahawk in her forehead , tore off her scalp , and gashed her breast ! They then covered her body with leaves , and left her under the huge pine-tree . One of the Indians made her lover acquainted with the facts , and another brought him her scalp . He knew the long brown tresses of Miss McRea , and , in defiance of all danger , flew to the spot to realize the horrid scene . He tore away the thinly-spread leaves — clasped the still-bleeding body in his arms , and , wrapping it in his cloak , was about bearing it away , when he was prevented by his superior officers , who ordered the poor girl to be buried on the spot where she had been immolated . After this event a curse seemed to rest upon the red-man . In every battle their forces were sadly cut up — the Americans attacking them most furiously whenever they could get an opportunity . The prophets of the Indians had strange auguries ; they saw constantly in the clouds the form of the murdered white woman , invoking the blasts to overwhelm them , and direction all the power and fury of the Americans to exterminate every red-man of the forest who had committed the hateful deed of breaking his faith and staining the tomahawk with the blood of a woman , whose spirit still called for revenge . It was agreed among the Indians in a body to move silently away ; and by morning 's light not a red-man was to be found near the British troops . Captain Jones , too , was no more . In the battle he led on his men with that fearlessness and fury that distressed minds often do ; but his men grew tired of following him in such perilous attacks , and began to fly . As he returned to rally them he received a ball in the back . Burning with shame , love , and frenzy , he tuned and threw himself on the bayonets of the enemy , and at once closed his agonies and expiated his political offence . He was laid by the side of her he had so ardently loved and deeply lamented . ” — Events of the Revolution .</p>
