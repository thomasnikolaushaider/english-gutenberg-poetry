     <l n="2">I see through half-shut eyelids languorous</l>
     <l n="3">The old monotonous</l>
     <l n="4">Gold sun set slowly through the western portal ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">I am a little weary of the Persian</l>

     <l n="9">And I am weary of</l>
     <l n="10">The smoking censers , and the sweet diversion</l>
     <l n="11">Of stroking Leila 's jasmine-scented hair ,</l>
     <l n="12">I thought so fair .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">At last I think I am quite tired of beauty ;</l>

     <l n="15">I think if I might die ,</l>
     <l n="16">Something more sweet , less tiring than the duty</l>
     <l n="17">Of kissing her , might be ; I am tired of myrrh ,</l>

     <l n="21">And now a little peace !</l>
     <l n="22">For see , moon-faced Leila hath repented</l>
     <l n="23">Of singing Hafiz ’ songs melodiously ,</l>
     <l n="24">And languidly .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">Surely all things are vain , and great thanksgiving</l>

     <l n="27">And all my heart is fain</l>
     <l n="28">Of something , something , far too great for living ;</l>
     <l n="29">Nothing is very sad , nor wonderful ,</l>
     <l n="30">Nor beautiful .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">

     <l n="33">And once , alas , I pray 'd</l>
     <l n="34">That gorgeous , golden sins be mine for sinning ;</l>
     <l n="35">But now I would not leave my palanquin</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">And long ago I prov 'd in great compassion</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="40">I would he were , that in the olden fashion</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="43">Then with philosophy I bor 'd me duly ;</l>
     <l n="44">And since I could not slumber all the time ,</l>
     <l n="45">I , in sweet golden rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="46">On white papyrus scented with patchouli</l>
     <l n="47">Wrote masterpieces starry-beautiful .</l>
     <l n="48">The earth was full .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="49">So beauty wearied me ; in order slowly</l>
     <l n="50">Love , Joy , and Victory came unto me ;</l>
     <l n="51">I kiss 'd them languidly ;</l>
     <l n="52">And Virtue came , and Duty , stiff and holy ;</l>
     <l n="53">To these I said — Pray come another day ;</l>
     <l n="54">And turn 'd away .</l>

     <l n="55">Now since of all I am a little weary ,</l>

     <l n="58">The censer of my long existence dreary ,</l>
     <l n="59">All things shall walk , that own my mastery ,</l>
     <l n="60">In luxury .</l>

     <l n="64">Like to a consecrated bishop holy ;</l>

     <l n="70">And walk unto the velvet-falling measure</l>
     <l n="71">Of golden-voiced , solemn-sounding shawms .</l>
     <l n="72">No rhyme for shawms .</l>

      <l n="136">Ignorance , ignorance , shrouds him like a pall ;</l>

     <l n="97">Behold , O well-beloved , ‘ neath the moonlight gleaming</l>
     <l n="98">The travellers depart from out the sleeping khan ,</l>
     <l n="99">O perfume Asian !</l>
     <l n="100">And past the moonlit palace , where we two lie dreaming ,</l>
     <l n="101">With camels and with horsemen like to shadows seeming</l>
     <l n="102">Departs the caravan .</l>

     <l n="103">It is the starting hour , O most melancholy !</l>
     <l n="104">In long procession underneath the moon 's pale gleams ,</l>
     <l n="105">Like something that but seems ,</l>
     <l n="106">The caravan departeth to the desert slowly ,</l>
     <l n="107">There far afar to seek through endless time the holy</l>
     <l n="108">Mirages of their dreams .</l>

     <l n="1">These paltry rhymes , which loftier shall pursue</l>
     <l n="2">Than aught America of high or great</l>
     <l n="3">Hath seen since first began her world-wide state ,</l>
     <l n="4">I dedicate , my brother , unto you .</l>
