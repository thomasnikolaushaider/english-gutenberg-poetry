Sweet ! when first my baby ear Curled itself and learned to hear , ‘ Twas your silver-singing voice Made my baby heart rejoice . Hushed upon your tender breast , Soft you sang me to my rest ; Waking , when I sought my play , Still your singing led the way . Cradle songs , more soft and low Than the bird croons on the bough ; Olden ballads , grave and gay , Warrior 's chant , and lover 's lay . So my baby hours went In a cadence of content , To the music and the rhyme Keeping tune and keeping time . So you taught me , too , ere long , All our life should be a song ,— Should a faltering prelude be To the heavenly harmony ; And with gracious words and high , Bade me look beyond the sky , To the Glory throned above , To th ’ eternal Light and Love . Many years have blossomed by : Far and far from childhood I ; Yet its sunrays on me fall , Here among my children all . So among my babes I go , Singing high and singing low ; Striving for the silver tone Which my memory holds alone . If I chant my little lays Tunefully , be yours the praise ; If I fail , ‘ tis I must rue Not t ’ have closelier followed you .</docImprint>

    <docTitle><titlePart>IN MY NURSERY . In my nursery as I sit , To and fro the children flit : Rosy Alice , eldest born , Rosalind like summer morn , Sturdy Hal , as brown as berry , Little Julia , shy and merry , John the King , who rules us all , And the Baby sweet and small . Flitting , flitting to and fro , Light they come and light they go : And their presence fair and young Still I weave into my song . Here rings out their merry laughter , Here their speech comes tripping after : Here their pranks , their sportive ways , Flash along the lyric maze , Till I hardly know , in fine , What is theirs and what is mine : Can but say , through wind and weather , They and I have wrought together . THE BABY 'S FUTURE . What will the baby be , Mamma , ( With a kick and a crow , and a hushaby-low ) . What will the baby be , Mamma , When he grows up into a man ? Will he always kick , and always crow , And flourish his arms and his legs about so , And make up such horrible faces , you know , As ugly as ever he can ? The baby he may be a soldier , my dear , With a fife and a drum , and a rum-tiddy-tum ! The baby he may be a soldier , my dear , When he grows up into a man . He will draw up his regiment all in a row , And flourish his sword in the face of the foe , Who will hie them away on a tremulous toe , As quickly as ever they can . The baby he may be a sailor , my dear , With a fore and an aft , and a tight little craft The baby he may be a sailor , my dear , When he grows up into a man . He will hoist his sails with a “ Yo ! heave , ho ! ” And take in his reefs when it comes on to blow , And shiver his timbers and so forth , you know , On a genuine nautical plan . The baby he may be a doctor , my dear , With a powder and pill , and a nice little bill . The baby he may be a doctor , my dear , When he grows up into a man . He will dose you with rhubarb , and calomel too , With draughts that are black and with pills that are blue ; And the chances will be , when he 's finished with you , You 'll be worse off than when he began . The baby he may be a lawyer , my dear , With a bag and a fee , and a legal decree . The baby he may be a lawyer , my dear , When he grows up into a man . But , oh ! dear me , should I tell to you The terrible things that a lawyer can do , You would take to your heels when he came into view , And run from Beersheba to Dan . BABY 'S HAND . Like a little crumpled roseleaf It lies on my bosom now , Like a tiny sunset cloudlet , Like a flake of rose-tinted snow ; And the pretty , helpless fingers Are never a moment at rest , But ever are moving and straying About on the mother 's breast : Trying to grasp the sunbeam That streams through the window high ; Trying to catch the white garments Of the angels hovering by . And as she pats and caresses The dear little lovely hand , The mother 's thoughts go forward Toward the future 's shadowy land . And ever her anxious vision Strives to pierce each coming year , With a mother 's height of rapture , With a mother 's depth of fear , As she thinks , “ In the years that are coming , Be they many or be they few , What work is the good God sending For this little hand to do ? Will it always be open in giving , And always strong for the right ? Will it always be ready for labor , Yet always gentle and light ? Will it wield the brush or the chisel In the magical realms of Art ? Will it waken the loveliest music To gladden the weary heart ? Will it smooth the sufferer 's pillow , Bring rest to his aching head ? Will it proffer the cup of cold water ? By it shall the hungry be fed ? Oh ! in the years that are coming , Be they many or be they few , What now is the good God sending For this little hand to do ? ” Thus the mother 's anxious vision Strives to pierce each coming year , With a mother 's height of rapture , With a mother 's depth of fear . Ah ! whatever may be its fortunes , Whatever in life its part , This little wee hand will never loose Its hold on the mother 's heart . THE FIRST TOOTH . My own little beautiful Baby , You 're weeping most bitterly , dear ! There 'd soon be a lake , if we treasured Each sweet little silvery tear . A lake ? Nay ! an ocean of sorrow Would murmur and sigh at your feet , And you would be drowned in your tear-drops , My own little Baby sweet . But , darling , as in the wide ocean The divers plunge boldly down , And bring up the radiant pearl-drops To set in some royal crown , E'en so from the sea of your sorrow , This dolorous “ fountain of youth , ” Will come , ere a week be over , A little wee pearly tooth . And then the tears will all vanish , Dried up by the sunshine of smiles ; And we 'll have back our own little Alice , With her merriest frolics and wiles . And whenever you laugh , my Baby , Through all your life 's happy years , You 'll show us the radiant pearl-drop That you brought from the ocean of tears . JOHNNY 'S BY-LOW SONG . Here on our rock-away horse we go , Johnny and I , to a land we know ,— Far away in the sunset gold , A lovelier land than can be told . Chorus . Where all the flowers go niddlety nod , Nod , nod , niddlety nod ! Where all the flowers go niddlety nod , And all the birds sing by-low ! Lullaby , lullaby , by-low . The gates are ivory set with pearls , One for the boys , and one for the girls : So shut your bonny two eyes of blue , Or else they never will let you through . Chorus . Where all the flowers go niddlety nod , Nod , nod , niddlety nod ! Where all the flowers go niddlety nod , And all the birds sing by-low ! Lullaby , lullaby , by-low . But what are the children all about ? There 's never a laugh and never a shout . Why , they all fell asleep , dear , long ago ; For how could they keep awake , you know ? Chorus . When all the flowers went niddlety nod , Nod , nod , niddlety nod ! When all the flowers went niddlety nod , And all the birds sang by-low ! Lullaby , lullaby , by-low . And each little brown or golden head Is pillowed soft in a satin bed ,— A satin bed with sheets of silk , As soft as down and as white as milk . Chorus . And all the flowers go niddlety nod , Nod , nod , niddlety nod ! And all the flowers go niddlety nod , And all the birds sing by-low ! Lullaby , lullaby , by-low . The brook in its sleep goes babbling by , And the fat little clouds are asleep in the sky ; And now little Johnny is sleeping too , So open the gates and pass him through . Chorus . Where all the flowers go niddlety nod , Nod , nod , niddlety nod ! Where all the flowers go niddlety nod , And all the birds sing by-low ! Lullaby , lullaby , by-low . BABY 'S VALENTINE . Valentine , O Valentine , Pretty little Love of mine ; Little Love whose yellow hair Makes the daffodils despair ; Little Love whose shining eyes Fill the stars with sad surprise : Hither turn your ten wee toes , Each a tiny shut-up rose , End most fitting and complete For the rosy-pinky feet ; Toddle , toddle here to me , For I 'm waiting , do you see ?— Waiting for to call you mine , Valentine , O Valentine ! Valentine , O Valentine , I will dress you up so fine ! Here 's a frock of tulip-leaves , Trimmed with lace the spider weaves ; Here 's a cap of larkspur blue , Just precisely made for you ; Here 's a mantle scarlet-dyed , Once the tiger-lily 's pride , Spotted all with velvet black Like the fire-beetle 's back ; Lady-slippers on your feet , Now behold you all complete ! Come and let me call you mine , Valentine , O Valentine ! Valentine , O Valentine , Now a wreath for you I 'll twine . I will set you on a throne Where the damask rose has blown , Dropping all her velvet bloom , Carpeting your leafy room : Here while you shall sit in pride , Butterflies all rainbow-pied , Dandy beetles gold and green , Creeping , flying , shall be seen , Every bird that shakes his wings , Every katydid that sings , Wasp and bee with buzz and hum . Hither , hither see them come , Creeping all before your feet , Rendering their homage meet . But ‘ tis I that call you mine , Valentine , O Valentine ! THE RAIN . The rain came down from the sky , And we asked it the reason why It would ne'er stay away On washing day , To let our poor clothes get dry . The rain came down on the ground , With a clattering , pelting sound , “ Indeed , if I stayed Till you called me , ” it said , “ I should not come all the year round ! ” THE BALLAD OF THE FAIRY SPOON . The little wee baby came tripping All out of the fairy land , With a nosegay of fairy flowers Clasped close in each little wee hand ; The flower of baby beauty , The flower of baby health , And all the blossomy sweetness That makes up a baby 's wealth . But still he kept sighing and sobbing , Sighing and sobbing away , Till I said , “ Now what ails my Baby , And why does he cry all day ? ” And he answered , “ Oh ! as I came tripping , I spied a rose by the way : And on it the loveliest dewdrop I 'd seen since I came away . “ But as I was stooping to sip it , A wind came up from the south ; And it blew my little wee spoonie Away from my little wee mouth . ”</titlePart></docTitle>
    <epigraph>
     <p>“ And what was your little wee spoonie ? And what does my Baby mean ? ” “ Oh ! the little wee fairy spoonie That was given me by the queen . “ For whenever a baby leaves her , The queen she grants him a boon ,— She fills both his hands with flowers , And puts in his mouth a spoon . “ And some are made of the hazel , And some are made of the horn ; And some are made of the silver white , For the good-luck babes that are born . ” “ But what are they for , my Baby ? ” “ Nay ! that part I cannot tell ! But send for the fairy Spoonman , For he knows it all right well . “ Oh ! the little old fairy Spoonman , He lives in the white , white moon . Send a whisper up by a moonbeam , And he will be down here soon . ” Then I whispered along a moonbeam That silvered the grass so clear , “ Oh ! little old fairy Spoonman , Come down and comfort my dear ! ” Then something came sliding , sliding Down out of the white , white moon . And something came gliding , gliding Straight in at my window soon . And there stood a little old fairy , All bent and withered and black , With a leathern apron about him , And a bundle of spoons at his back . And first he looked at my baby , And then he looked at me ; And then he looked at his apron , But never a word spake he . “ Oh ! Spoonman dear , ” said the baby , “ The wind blew my spoon away . So now will you give me another , You little black Spoonman , pray ? “ For I did not lose my spoonie , Nor drop it carelessly ; But a wind came up to my poor little mouth , And blew it away from me . ” “ Now well for you , ” said the Spoonman , “ Little Baby , if this be so . For if you had carelessly lost your spoon , Without it through life you 'd go . “ And well for you , little Baby , If you know your spoon again . For but if you know the very same one , Your asking will be in vain . “ So say : was it made of the hazel , Or was it made of the horn , Or was it made of the silver white , If a good-luck babe you were born ? ” “ Oh ! it was nor horn nor hazel , But all of the silver bright ; For a good-luck babe I was born indeed , To be my Mammy 's delight . ” “ Then take your spoon , little Baby , With the fairies ’ blessing free , For the south wind blew it around the world , And blew it again to me . ” With that he gave to my baby The tiniest silver spoon . Then out he slipped in the moonlight , And we lost him from sight right soon . Now some may think I am foolish , And some may think I am mad ; But never once since that very night Has my baby been cross or sad . And I counsel all anxious mothers Whose babies are crying in pain , To send for the fairy Spoonman , And get them their spoons again . SONG OF THE LITTLE WINDS . The birdies may sleep , but the winds must wake Early and late , for the birdies ’ sake . Kissing them , fanning them , soft and sweet , E'en till the dark and the dawning meet . The flowers may sleep , but the winds must wake Early and late , for the flowers ’ sake . Rocking the buds on the rose-mother 's breast , Swinging the hyacinth-bells to rest . The children may sleep , but the winds must wake Early and late , for the children 's sake . Singing so sweet in each little one 's ear , He thinks his mother 's own song to hear . GOOD-NIGHT SONG . Good-night , Sun ! go to bed ! Take your crown from your shining head . Now put on your gray night-cap , And shut your eyes for a good long nap . Good-night , Sky , bright and blue ! Not a wink of sleep for you . You must watch us all the night , With your twinkling eyes so bright . Good-night , flowers ! now shut up Every swinging bell and cup . Take your sleeping-draught of dew : Pleasant dreams to all of you ! Good-night , birds , that sweetly sing ! Little head ‘ neath little wing ! Every leaf upon the tree Soft shall sing your lullaby . Last to you , little child , Sleep is coming soft and mild . Now he shuts your blue eyes bright : Little Baby dear , good-night ! ANOTHER “ GOOD-NIGHT . ” Birds , birds , in the linden-tree , Low , low let your music be ! Bees , bees , in the garden bloom , Hushed , hushed be your drowsy hum ! Wind , wind , through the lattice waft Still , still , thy breathing soft ! Flowers , sweet be the breath you shed : Two little children are going to bed . Eyes , eyes , ‘ neath your curtains white , Veiled , veiled be the sunny light ! Lips , lips , like the roses red , Soft , soft be your sweet prayers said ! Feet , feet , that have danced all day , Now , now must your dancing stay . Low , low lay each golden head ! Two little children are going to bed .</p>
