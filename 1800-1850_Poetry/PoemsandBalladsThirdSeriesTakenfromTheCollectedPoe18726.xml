    <head>MARCH : AN ODE</head>
     <l n="1">1887</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I</p>
   <p>Ere frost-flower and snow-blossom faded and fell , and the splendour of winter had passed out of sight , The ways of the woodlands were fairer and stranger than dreams that fulfil us in sleep with delight ; The breath of the mouths of the winds had hardened on tree-tops and branches that glittered and swayed Such wonders and glories of blossomlike snow or of frost that outlightens all flowers till it fade That the sea was not lovelier than here was the land , nor the night than the day , nor the day than the night , Nor the winter sublimer with storm than the spring : such mirth had the madness and might in thee made , March , master of winds , bright minstrel and marshal of storms that enkindle the season they smite .</p>
   <p>II</p>
   <p>And now that the rage of thy rapture is satiate with revel and ravin and spoil of the snow , And the branches it brightened are broken , and shattered the tree-tops that only thy wrath could lay low , How should not thy lovers rejoice in thee , leader and lord of the year that exults to be born So strong in thy strength and so glad of thy gladness whose laughter puts winter and sorrow to scorn ? Thou hast shaken the snows from thy wings , and the frost on thy forehead is molten : thy lips are aglow As a lover 's that kindle with kissing , and earth , with her raiment and tresses yet wasted and torn , Takes breath as she smiles in the grasp of thy passion to feel through her spirit the sense of thee flow .</p>
    <p>III</p>
   <p>Fain , fain would we see but again for an hour what the wind and the sun have dispelled and consumed , Those full deep swan-soft feathers of snow with whose luminous burden the branches implumed Hung heavily , curved as a half-bent bow , and fledged not as birds are , but petalled as flowers , Each tree-top and branchlet a pinnacle jewelled and carved , or a fountain that shines as it showers , But fixed as a fountain is fixed not , and wrought not to last till by time or by tempest entombed , As a pinnacle carven and gilded of men : for the date of its doom is no more than an hour 's , One hour of the sun 's when the warm wind wakes him to wither the snow-flowers that froze as they bloomed .</p>
   <p>IV</p>
   <p>As the sunshine quenches the snowshine ; as April subdues thee , and yields up his kingdom to May ; So time overcomes the regret that is born of delight as it passes in passion away , And leaves but a dream for desire to rejoice in or mourn for with tears or thanksgivings ; but thou , Bright god that art gone from us , maddest and gladdest of months , to what goal hast thou gone from us now ? For somewhere surely the storm of thy laughter that lightens , the beat of thy wings that play , Must flame as a fire through the world , and the heavens that we know not rejoice in thee : surely thy brow Hath lost not its radiance of empire , thy spirit the joy that impelled it on quest as for prey .</p>
    <p>V</p>
   <p>Are thy feet on the ways of the limitless waters , thy wings on the winds of the waste north sea ? Are the fires of the false north dawn over heavens where summer is stormful and strong like thee Now bright in the sight of thine eyes ? are the bastions of icebergs assailed by the blast of thy breath ? Is it March with the wild north world when April is waning ? the word that the changed year saith , Is it echoed to northward with rapture of passion reiterate from spirits triumphant as we Whose hearts were uplift at the blast of thy clarions as men 's rearisen from a sleep that was death And kindled to life that was one with the world 's and with thine ? hast thou set not the whole world free ?</p>
   <p>VI</p>
   <p>For the breath of thy lips is freedom , and freedom 's the sense of thy spirit , the sound of thy song , Glad god of the north-east wind , whose heart is as high as the hands of thy kingdom are strong , Thy kingdom whose empire is terror and joy , twin-featured and fruitful of births divine , Days lit with the flame of the lamps of the flowers , and nights that are drunken with dew for wine , And sleep not for joy of the stars that deepen and quicken , a denser and fierier throng , And the world that thy breath bade whiten and tremble rejoices at heart as they strengthen and shine , And earth gives thanks for the glory bequeathed her , and knows of thy reign that it wrought not wrong .</p>
    <p>VII</p>
   <p>Thy spirit is quenched not , albeit we behold not thy face in the crown of the steep sky 's arch , And the bold first buds of the whin wax golden , and witness arise of the thorn and the larch : Wild April , enkindled to laughter and storm by the kiss of the wildest of winds that blow , Calls loud on his brother for witness ; his hands that were laden with blossom are sprinkled with snow , And his lips breathe winter , and laugh , and relent ; and the live woods feel not the frost 's flame parch ; For the flame of the spring that consumes not but quickens is felt at the heart of the forest aglow , And the sparks that enkindled and fed it were strewn from the hands of the gods of the winds of March .</p>

   <p>Three hundred summers have fallen as leaves by the storms in their season thinned , Since northward the war-ships of Spain came sheer up the way of the south-west wind : Where the citadel cliffs of England are flanked with bastions of serpentine , Far off to the windward loomed their hulls , an hundred and twenty-nine , All filled full of the war , full-fraught with battle and charged with bale ; Then store-ships weighted with cannon ; and all were an hundred and fifty sail . The measureless menace of darkness anhungered with hope to prevail upon light , The shadow of death made substance , the present and visible spirit of night , Came , shaped as a waxing or waning moon that rose with the fall of day , To the channel where couches the Lion in guard of the gate of the lustrous bay . Fair England , sweet as the sea that shields her , and pure as the sea from stain , Smiled , hearing hardly for scorn that stirred her the menace of saintly Spain .</p>

    <head>“ They that ride over ocean wide with hempen bridle and horse of tree , ” How shall they in the darkening day of wrath and anguish and fear go free ? How shall these that have curbed the seas not feel his bridle who made the sea ?</head>
     <l n="1">God shall bow them and break them now : for what is man in the Lord</l>
     <l n="2">God 's sight ?</l>
     <l n="3">Fear shall shake them , and shame shall break , and all the noon of</l>
     <l n="4">their pride be night :</l>
     <l n="5">These that sinned shall the ravening wind of doom bring under , and</l>
     <l n="6">judgment smite .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>England broke from her neck the yoke , and rent the fetter , and mocked the rod : Shrines of old that she decked with gold she turned to dust , to the dust she trod : What is she , that the wind and sea should fight beside her , and war with God ?</p>
   <p>Lo , the cloud of his ships that crowd her channel 's inlet with storm sublime , Darker far than the tempests are that sweep the skies of her northmost clime ; Huge and dense as the walls that fence the secret darkness of unknown time .</p>
   <p>Mast on mast as a tower goes past , and sail by sail as a cloud 's wing spread ; Fleet by fleet , as the throngs whose feet keep time with death in his dance of dread ; Galleons dark as the helmsman 's bark of old that ferried to hell the dead .</p>
   <p>Squadrons proud as their lords , and loud with tramp of soldiers and chant of priests ; Slaves there told by the thousandfold , made fast in bondage as herded beasts ; Lords and slaves that the sweet free waves shall feed on , satiate with funeral feasts .</p>
   <p>Nay , not so shall it be , they know ; their priests have said it ; can priesthood lie ? God shall keep them , their God shall sleep not : peril and evil shall pass them by : Nay , for these are his children ; seas and winds shall bid not his children die .</p>
   <p>II</p>
   <p>So they boast them , the monstrous host whose menace mocks at the dawn : and here They that wait at the wild sea 's gate , and watch the darkness of doom draw near , How shall they in their evil day sustain the strength of their hearts for fear ?</p>
   <p>Full July in the fervent sky sets forth her twentieth of changing morns : Winds fall mild that of late waxed wild : no presage whispers or wails or warns : Far to west on the bland sea 's breast a sailing crescent uprears her horns .</p>
   <p>Seven wide miles the serene sea smiles between them stretching from rim to rim : Soft they shine , but a darker sign should bid not hope or belief wax dim : God 's are these men , and not the sea 's : their trust is set not on her but him .</p>
   <p>God 's ? but who is the God whereto the prayers and incense of these men rise ? What is he , that the wind and sea should fear him , quelled by his sunbright eyes ? What , that men should return again , and hail him Lord of the servile skies ?</p>
   <p>Hell 's own flame at his heavenly name leaps higher and laughs , and its gulfs rejoice : Plague and death from his baneful breath take life and lighten , and praise his choice : Chosen are they to devour for prey the tribes that hear not and fear his voice .</p>
   <p>Ay , but we that the wind and sea gird round with shelter of storms and waves Know not him that ye worship , grim as dreams that quicken from dead men 's graves : God is one with the sea , the sun , the land that nursed us , the love that saves .</p>
   <p>Love whose heart is in ours , and part of all things noble and all things fair ; Sweet and free as the circling sea , sublime and kind as the fostering air ; Pure of shame as is England 's name , whose crowns to come are as crowns that were .</p>
   <p>IV</p>
    <p>I</p>
   <p>But the Lord of darkness , the God whose love is a flaming fire , The master whose mercy fulfils wide hell till its torturers tire , He shall surely have heed of his servants who serve him for love , not hire .</p>
   <p>They shall fetter the wing of the wind whose pinions are plumed with foam : For now shall thy horn be exalted , and now shall thy bolt strike home ; Yea , now shall thy kingdom come , Lord God of the priests of Rome .</p>
   <p>They shall cast thy curb on the waters , and bridle the waves of the sea : They shall say to her , Peace , be still : and stillness and peace shall be : And the winds and the storms shall hear them , and tremble , and worship thee .</p>
   <p>Thy breath shall darken the morning , and wither the mounting sun ; And the daysprings , frozen and fettered , shall know thee , and cease to run ; The heart of the world shall feel thee , and die , and thy will be done .</p>
   <p>The spirit of man that would sound thee , and search out causes of things , Shall shrink and subside and praise thee : and wisdom , with plume-plucked wings , Shall cower at thy feet and confess thee , that none may fathom thy springs .</p>
   <p>The fountains of song that await but the wind of an April to be To burst the bonds of the winter , and speak with the sound of a sea , The blast of thy mouth shall quench them : and song shall be only of thee .</p>
   <p>The days that are dead shall quicken , the seasons that were shall return ; And the streets and the pastures of England , the woods that burgeon and yearn , Shall be whitened with ashes of women and children and men that burn .</p>
   <p>For the mother shall burn with the babe sprung forth of her womb in fire , And bride with bridegroom , and brother with sister , and son with sire ; And the noise of the flames shall be sweet in thine ears as the sound of a lyre .</p>
   <p>Yea , so shall thy kingdom be stablished , and so shall the signs of it be : And the world shall know , and the wind shall speak , and the sun shall see , That these are the works of thy servants , whose works bear witness to thee .</p>
   <p>II</p>
   <p>But the dusk of the day falls fruitless , whose light should have lit them on : Sails flash through the gloom to shoreward , eclipsed as the sun that shone : And the west wind wakes with dawn , and the hope that was here is gone .</p>
   <p>Around they wheel and around , two knots to the Spaniard 's one , The wind-swift warriors of England , who shoot as with shafts of the sun , With fourfold shots for the Spaniard 's , that spare not till day be done .</p>
   <p>And the wind with the sundown sharpens , and hurtles the ships to the lee , And Spaniard on Spaniard smites , and shatters , and yields ; and we , Ere battle begin , stand lords of the battle , acclaimed of the sea .</p>
   <p>And the day sweeps round to the nightward ; and heavy and hard the waves Roll in on the herd of the hurtling galleons ; and masters and slaves Reel blind in the grasp of the dark strong wind that shall dig their graves .</p>
   <p>For the sepulchres hollowed and shaped of the wind in the swerve of the seas , The graves that gape for their pasture , and laugh , thrilled through by the breeze , The sweet soft merciless waters , await and are fain of these .</p>
   <p>As the hiss of a Python heaving in menace of doom to be They hear through the clear night round them , whose hours are as clouds that flee , The whisper of tempest sleeping , the heave and the hiss of the sea .</p>
   <p>But faith is theirs , and with faith are they girded and helmed and shod : Invincible are they , almighty , elect for a sword and a rod ; Invincible even as their God is omnipotent , infinite , God .</p>
   <p>In him is their strength , who have sworn that his glory shall wax not dim : In his name are their war-ships hallowed as mightiest of all that swim : The men that shall cope with these , and conquer , shall cast out him .</p>
   <p>In him is the trust of their hearts ; the desire of their eyes is he ; The light of their ways , made lightning for men that would fain be free : Earth 's hosts are with them , and with them is heaven : but with us is the sea .</p>

   <p>“ Spain clings fast to thee ; Spain , aghast with anguish , cries to thee ; where art thou ? Spain puts trust in thee ; lo , the dust that soils and darkens her prostrate brow ! Spain is true to thy service ; who shall raise up Spain for thy service now ?</p>
   <p>“ Who shall praise thee , if none may raise thy servants up , nor affright thy foes ? Winter wanes , and the woods and plains forget the likeness of storms and snows : So shall fear of thee fade even here : and what shall follow thee no man knows . ”</p>
   <p>Lords of night , who would breathe your blight on April 's morning and August 's noon , God your Lord , the condemned , the abhorred , sinks hellward , smitten with deathlike swoon : Death 's own dart in his hateful heart now thrills , and night shall receive him soon .</p>
   <p>God the Devil , thy reign of revel is here for ever eclipsed and fled : God the Liar , everlasting fire lays hold at last on thee , hand and head : God the Accurst , the consuming thirst that burns thee never shall here be fed .</p>
   <p>II</p>
   <p>England , queen of the waves whose green inviolate girdle enrings thee round , Mother fair as the morning , where is now the place of thy foemen found ? Still the sea that salutes us free proclaims them stricken , acclaims thee crowned .</p>
   <p>Times may change , and the skies grow strange with signs of treason and fraud and fear : Foes in union of strange communion may rise against thee from far and near : Sloth and greed on thy strength may feed as cankers waxing from year to year .</p>
   <p>Yet , though treason and fierce unreason should league and lie and defame and smite , We that know thee , how far below thee the hatred burns of the sons of night , We that love thee , behold above thee the witness written of life in light .</p>
   <p>Life that shines from thee shows forth signs that none may read not but eyeless foes : Hate , born blind , in his abject mind grows hopeful now but as madness grows : Love , born wise , with exultant eyes adores thy glory , beholds and glows .</p>
   <p>Truth is in thee , and none may win thee to lie , forsaking the face of truth : Freedom lives by the grace she gives thee , born again from thy deathless youth : Faith should fail , and the world turn pale , wert thou the prey of the serpent 's tooth .</p>
   <p>Greed and fraud , unabashed , unawed , may strive to sting thee at heel in vain : Craft and fear and mistrust may leer and mourn and murmur and plead and plain : Thou art thou : and thy sunbright brow is hers that blasted the strength of Spain .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Mother , mother beloved , none other could claim in place of thee</l>
     <l n="2">England 's place :</l>
     <l n="3">Earth bears none that beholds the sun so pure of record , so clothed</l>
     <l n="4">with grace :</l>
     <l n="5">Dear our mother , nor son nor brother is thine , as strong or as fair</l>
     <l n="6">of face .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>How shalt thou be abased ? or how shall fear take hold of thy heart ? of thine , England , maiden immortal , laden with charge of life and with hopes divine ? Earth shall wither , when eyes turned hither behold not light in her darkness shine .</p>
   <p>England , none that is born thy son , and lives , by grace of thy glory , free , Lives and yearns not at heart and burns with hope to serve as he worships thee ; None may sing thee : the sea-wind 's wing beats down our songs as it hails the sea .</p>

    <head>A WORD WITH THE WIND</head>
     <l n="1">Lord of days and nights that hear thy word of wintry warning ,</l>
     <l n="2">Wind , whose feet are set on ways that none may tread ,</l>
     <l n="3">Change the nest wherein thy wings are fledged for flight by</l>
     <l n="4">morning ,</l>
     <l n="5">Change the harbour whence at dawn thy sails are spread .</l>
     <l n="6">Not the dawn , ere yet the imprisoning night has half released her ,</l>
     <l n="7">More desires the sun 's full face of cheer , than we ,</l>
     <l n="8">Well as yet we love the strength of the iron-tongued north-easter ,</l>
     <l n="9">Yearn for wind to meet us as we front the sea .</l>
     <l n="10">All thy ways are good , O wind , and all the world should fester ,</l>
     <l n="11">Were thy fourfold godhead quenched , or stilled thy strife :</l>
     <l n="12">Yet the waves and we desire too long the deep south-wester ,</l>
     <l n="13">Whence the waters quicken shoreward , clothed with life .</l>
     <l n="14">Yet the field not made for ploughing save of keels nor harrowing</l>
     <l n="15">Save of storm-winds lies unbrightened by thy breath :</l>
     <l n="16">Banded broad with ruddy samphire glow the sea-banks narrowing</l>
     <l n="17">Westward , while the sea gleams chill and still as death .</l>
     <l n="18">Sharp and strange from inland sounds thy bitter note of battle ,</l>
     <l n="19">Blown between grim skies and waters sullen-souled ,</l>
     <l n="20">Till the baffled seas bear back , rocks roar and shingles rattle ,</l>
     <l n="21">Vexed and angered and anhungered and acold .</l>
     <l n="22">Change thy note , and give the waves their will , and all the</l>
     <l n="23">measure ,</l>
     <l n="24">Full and perfect , of the music of their might ,</l>
     <l n="25">Let it fill the bays with thunderous notes and throbs of pleasure ,</l>

     <l n="30">Bids the rocks and reefs respond in rapturous chime .</l>

     <l n="34">Winged with cloud whose wrath shall bid love 's day be done .</l>
     <l n="35">Yet shall darkness bring the awakening sea a lordlier lover ,</l>
     <l n="36">Clothed with strength more amorous and more strenuous will ,</l>
     <l n="37">Whence her heart of hearts shall kindle and her soul recover</l>
     <l n="38">Sense of love too keen to lie for love 's sake still .</l>
     <l n="39">Let thy strong south-western music sound , and bid the billows</l>
     <l n="40">Brighten , proud and glad to feel thy scourge and kiss</l>
     <l n="41">Sting and soothe and sway them , bowed as aspens bend or willows ,</l>
     <l n="42">Yet resurgent still in breathless rage of bliss .</l>
     <l n="43">All to-day the slow sleek ripples hardly bear up shoreward ,</l>

     <l n="46">Soft and listless as the slumber-stricken air .</l>
     <l n="47">Be the sunshine bared or veiled , the sky superb or shrouded ,</l>
     <l n="48">Still the waters , lax and languid , chafed and foiled ,</l>
     <l n="49">Keen and thwarted , pale and patient , clothed with fire or clouded ,</l>

    <head>DEDICATION</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The years are many , the changes more ,</l>
     <l n="2">Since wind and sun on the wild sweet shore</l>
     <l n="3">Where Joyous Gard stands stark by the sea</l>
     <l n="4">With face as bright as in years of yore</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Shone , swept , and sounded , and laughed for glee</l>
     <l n="6">More deep than a man 's or a child 's may be ,</l>
     <l n="7">On a day when summer was wild and glad ,</l>
     <l n="8">And the guests of the wind and the sun were we .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">The light that lightens from seasons clad</l>
     <l n="10">With darkness now , is it glad or sad ?</l>
     <l n="11">Not sad but glad should it shine , meseems ,</l>
     <l n="12">On eyes yet fain of the joy they had .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">For joy was there with us ; joy that gleams</l>
     <l n="14">And murmurs yet in the world of dreams</l>
     <l n="15">Where thought holds fast , as a constant warder ,</l>
     <l n="16">The days when I rode by moors and streams ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Reining my rhymes into buoyant order</l>
     <l n="18">Through honied leagues of the northland border .</l>
     <l n="19">Though thought or memory fade , and prove</l>
     <l n="20">A faithless keeper , a thriftless hoarder ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">One landmark never can change remove ,</l>
     <l n="22">One sign can the years efface not . Love ,</l>
     <l n="23">More strong than death or than doubt may be ,</l>
     <l n="24">Treads down their strengths , and abides above .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">Yea , change and death are his servants : we ,</l>
     <l n="26">Whom love of the dead links fast , though free ,</l>
     <l n="27">May smile as they that beheld the dove</l>
     <l n="28">Bear home her signal across the sea .</l>
