  <body>
   <p>In some collection of old English Ballads there is an ancient ditty which I am told bears some remote and distant resemblance to the following Epic Poem . I beg to quote the emphatic language of my estimable friend ( if he will allow me to call him so ) , the Black Bear in Piccadilly , and to assure all to whom these presents may come , that “ I am the original . ” This affecting legend is given in the following pages precisely as I have frequently heard it sung on Saturday nights , outside a house of general refreshment ( familiarly termed a wine vaults ) at Battle-bridge . The singer is a young gentleman who can scarcely have numbered nineteen summers , and who before his last visit to the treadmill , where he was erroneously incarcerated for six months as a vagrant ( being unfortunately mistaken for another gentleman ) , had a very melodious and plaintive tone of voice , which , though it is now somewhat impaired by gruel and such a getting up stairs for so long a period , I hope shortly to find restored . I have taken down the words from his own mouth at different periods , and have been careful to preserve his pronunciation , together with the air to which he does so much justice . Of his execution of it , however , and the intense melancholy which he communicates to such passages of the song as are most susceptible of such an expression , I am unfortunately unable to convey to the reader an adequate idea , though I may hint that the effect seems to me to be in part produced by the long and mournful drawl on the last two or three words of each verse .</p>
   <p>I had intended to have dedicated my imperfect illustrations of this beautiful Romance to the young gentleman in question . As I cannot find , however , that he is known among his friends by any other name than “ The Tripe-skewer , ” which I cannot but consider as a soubriquet , or nick-name ; and as I feel that it would be neither respectful nor proper to address him publicly by that title , I have been compelled to forego the pleasure . If this should meet his eye , will he pardon my humble attempt to embellish with the pencil the sweet ideas to which he gives such feeling utterance ? And will he believe me to remain his devoted admirer ,</p>

    <head>P. S .— The above is not my writing , nor the notes either , nor am I on familiar terms ( but quite the contrary ) with the Black Bear . Nevertheless I admit the accuracy of the statement relative to the public singer whose name is unknown , and concur generally in the sentiments above expressed relative to him .</head>

     <l n="1">Some foreign country for to see .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The reader is here in six words artfully made acquainted with Lord Bateman 's character and temperament .— Of a roving , wandering , and unsettled spirit , his Lordship left his native country , bound he knew not whither . Some foreign country he wished to see , and that was the extent of his desire ; any foreign country would answer his purpose — all foreign countries were alike to him . He was a citizen of the world , and upon the world of waters , sustained by the daring and reckless impulses of his heart , he boldly launched . For anything , from pitch-and-toss upwards to manslaughter , his Lordship was prepared . Lord Bateman 's character at this time , and his expedition , would appear to Have borne a striking resemblance to those of Lord Byron .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">His goblets brimmed with every costly wine ,</l>
     <l n="2">And all that mote to luxury invite .</l>
     <l n="3">Without a sigh he left to cross the brine ,</l>
     <l n="4">And traverse Paynim shores , and pass earth 's central line .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>CHILDE HAROLD , CANTO I . ]</head>
     <l n="1">This Turk he had , &amp; c .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The poet has here , by that bold license which only genius can venture upon , surmounted the extreme difficulty of introducing any particular Turk , by assuming a fore-gone conclusion in the reader 's mind , and adverting in a casual , careless way to a Turk unknown , as to an old acquaintance . “ This Turk he had — ” We have heard of no Turk before , and yet this familiar introduction satisfies us at once that we know him well . He was a pirate , no doubt , of a cruel and savage disposition , entertaining a hatred of the Christian race , and accustomed to garnish his trees and vines with such stray professors of Christianity as happened to fall into his hands . “ This Turk he had — ” is a master-stroke — a truly Shakspearian touch . There are few things like it in the language . ]</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And every holth she drunk unto him</l>
     <l n="2">Vos , “ I vish Lord Bateman as you vos mine ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>A most affecting illustration of the sweetest simplicity , the purest artlessness , and holiest affections of woman 's gentle nature . Bred up among the rough and savage crowds which thronged her father 's lawless halls , and meeting with no responsive or kindred spirit among those fierce barbarians ( many of whom , however , touched by her surpassing charms , though insensible to her virtues and mental endowments , had vainly sought her hand in marriage ) , this young creature had spent the greater part of her life in the solitude of her own apartments , or in contemplating the charms of nature arrayed in all the luxury of eastern voluptuousness . At length she hears from an aged and garrulous attendant , her only female adviser ( for her mother died when she was yet an infant ) , of the sorrows and sufferings of the Christian captive . Urged by pity and womanly sympathy , she repairs to his prison to succour and console him . She supports his feeble and tottering steps to her father 's cellar , recruits his exhausted frame with copious draughts of sparkling wine , and when his dim eye brightens , and his pale cheek becomes flushed with the glow of returning health and animation , she — unaccustomed to disguise or concealment , and being by nature all openness and truth — gives vent to the feelings which now thrill her maiden heart for the first time , in the rich gush of unspeakable love , tenderness , and devotion —</p>
   <p>I vish Lord Bateman as you vos mine ! ]</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Oh , in sevin long years I 'll make a wow ,</l>
     <l n="2">I 'll make a wow , and I 'll keep it strong .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Love has converted the tender girl into a majestic heroine ; she cannot only make “ a wow , ” but she can “ keep it strong ; ” she feels all the dignity of truth and love swelling in her bosom . With the view of possessing herself of the real state of Lord Bateman 's affections , and with no sordid or mercenary motives , she has enquired of that nobleman what are his means of subsistence , and whether all Northumberland belongs to him . His Lordship has rejoined , with a noble regard for truth , that half Northumberland is his , and that he will give it freely to the fair young lady who will release him from his dungeon . She , being thus assured of his regard and esteem , rejects all idea of pecuniary reward , and offers to be a party to a solemn wow — to be kept strong on both sides — that , if for seven years he will remain a bachelor , she , for the like period , will remain a maid . The contract is made , and the lovers are solemnly contracted . ]</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Now sevin long years is gone and past ,</l>
     <l n="2">And fourteen days vell known to me .</l>

   <p>In this may be recognised , though in a minor degree , the same gifted hand that portrayed the Mussulman , the pirate , the father , and the bigot , in two words . The time is gone , the historian knows it , and that is enough for the reader . This is the dignity of history very strikingly exemplified . ]</p>

   <p>Nothing perhaps could be more ingeniously contrived to express the vastness of Lord Bateman 's family mansion than this remarkable passage . The proud young porter had to thread courts , corridors , galleries , and staircases innumerable , before he could penetrate to those exquisite apartments in which Lord Bateman was wont to solace his leisure hours , with the most refined pleasures of his time . We behold him hastening to the presence of his lord : the repetition of the word “ avay ” causes us to feel the speed with which he hastens — at length he arrives . Does he appear before the chief with indecent haste ? Is he described as rushing madly into his presence to impart his message ? No ! a different atmosphere surrounds that remarkable man . Even this proud young porter is checked in his impetuous career which lasted only</p>

   <p>Vot news ! vot news ! my proud young porter ?</p>
   <p>A pleasant condescension on the part of his lordship , showing that he recognised the stately youth , and no less stately pride of office which characterized his follower , and that he was acquainted with the distinguishing appellation which he appears to have borne in the family . ]</p>
   <p>And broke his sword in splinters three .</p>
   <p>Exemplifying , in a highly poetical and striking manner , the force of Lord Bateman 's love , which he would seem to have kept strong as his “ wow . ” We have beheld him patient in confinement , descending to no base murmurings against fortune , even when chained by the middle to a tree , with the prospect of ending his days in that ignominious and unpleasant position . He has borne all this and a great deal more , seven years and a fortnight have elapsed , and , at last , on the mere mention of the fair young lady , he falls into a perfect phrenzy , and breaks his sword , the faithful partner and companion of his glory , into three splinters . Antiquarians differ respecting the intent and meaning of this ceremony , which has been construed and interpreted in many different ways . The strong probability is that it was done “ for luck ; ” and yet Lord Bateman should have been superior to the prejudices of the vulgar . ]</p>
   <p>If my own Sophia .</p>
   <p>So called doubtless from the mosque of St. Sophia , at Constantinople ; her father having professed the Mahomedan religion . ]</p>

     <l n="1">Then up and spoke this young bride 's mother ,</l>
     <l n="2">Who never vos heerd to speak so free .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This is an exquisite touch of nature , which most married men , whether of noble or plebeian blood , will quickly recognise . During the whole of her daughter 's courtship , the good old lady had scarcely spoken , save by expressive smiles and looks of approval . But now that her object is gained , and her daughter fast married ( as she thinks ) , she suddenly assumes quite a new tone , “ and never was heerd to speak so free . ” It would be difficult for poetry to comprehend any thing more strictly true and life-like than this . ]</p>
   <p>With both their hearts so full of glee .</p>
   <p>If any thing could add to the grace and beauty of the poem , it would be this most satisfactory and agreeable conclusion . At the time of the foreign lady 's arrival on the shores of England , we find Lord Bateman in the disagreeable dilemma of having contracted another marriage ; to which step his lordship has doubtless been impelled by despair of ever recovering his lost Sophia , and a natural anxiety not to die without leaving an heir to his estate . The ceremony has been performed , the Church has done its office , the bride and her mamma have taken possession of the castle , when the lost Sophia suddenly presents herself . An ordinary man would have been overwhelmed by such a complication of perplexities — not so Lord Bateman . Master of the human heart , he appeals to feminine ambition and love of display ; and , reminding the young lady that she came to him on a saddle horse ( with her revered parent following no doubt on foot behind ) , offers to bestow upon her a coach and three . The young lady closes with the proposition ; her august mother , having brought it about by her freedom of speech , makes no objection ; Lord Bateman , being a nobleman of great power , and having plenty of superfluous wealth to bestow upon the Church , orders another marriage , and boldly declares the first one to be a nullity . Thereupon “ another marriage ” is immediately prepared , and the piece closes with a picture of general happiness and hilarity . ]</p>
