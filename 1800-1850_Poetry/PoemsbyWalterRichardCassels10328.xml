     <item>DRAMATIS PERSONAE .</item>
     <item>ORAN , a Speculative Philosopher . MABEL , his Wife . HER FATHER . MAURICE , } ROGER , } her brothers .</item>
     <item>MABEL .</item>
     <item>SCENE I — A Study . Books , pictures , and sculpture about the room , interspersed with chemical and other instruments , globes , &amp; c .; a singular blending of science with art , indicating a delicate and speculative organization in the arranger .</item>
     <item>ORAN , MAURICE , and ROGER .</item>
     <item>ORAN .</item>
     <item>Well , well ! and so ye deem I love her not , Ye and the world that love so passing well ?— That still I trifle with her bright young life , As the wind plays with some frail water-bell , Wafting it wantonly about the sky , Till at some harsher breath it breaks and dies ?</item>
     <item>MAURICE .</item>
     <item>Nay , not thus far would our reflections go . Friendship paints not with the foul brush of Conscience ! But thou , a man of dark and mystic aims , Tracking out Science through forbidden ways , Leaving the light and trodden paths to grope ‘ Mid fearful speculations and wild dreams , May'st hunt thy Will-o ’ - the-wisp until thou lead'st Our sister , all unwitting , to her death .</item>
     <item>ROGER .</item>
     <item>That shalt thou answer unto us . Thy life Shall be to her life like the sun and shade , Lost in one setting .</item>
     <item>ORAN .</item>
     <item>Ay ! thou sayest well — Thou sayest well . How oft a random shaft Striketh King Truth betwixt the armour-joints !— One life , one sun , one setting for us both .</item>
     <item>Which way , then , tend your fears ? What certain aim Have all these strokes you level at my ways ?</item>
     <item>ROGER .</item>
     <item>We say that you , against all light received , Against all laws of prudence and of love , Practise dark magic on our sister 's soul — That by strange motions , incantations , spells , So work you on her spirit that strange sleep , Sombre as Death 's dark shadow , presently Steals o'er her fragile body , dulls her sense , And wraps her wholly in its chill embrace ; That thus , spell-bound , lost to the living world , She lies till thou again unwind her chain , And wak'st her feebly to this life of earth . Thus dost thou peril her , thou blinded man ! Sett'st her dear life against thy moonstruck thought , And slay'st thy dove on Folly 's altar-steps .</item>
     <item>MAURICE .</item>
     <item>Ay ! if you loved her , would your eyes have miss 'd The moonish faintness that o'erlaps her now , Melting the fresh , full , ruddy glow of health To loveliness most heavenly , yet most sad ? Her cheeks , where youth once summer 'd into roses , Glow now with faint exotic loveliness , Not native to this harsh and gusty earth ; And from her large dark eyes there seems to gaze Some angel with mute , melancholy looks , As from a casement at this jarring world .</item>
     <item>ORAN .</item>
     <item>Ha ! then you too have seen it ; it is not , O Heaven !— is not delusion , this fond dream , But even now it works , works bliss for her . Proceed , Sir ... you were saying ... Sir , I list ... That in her eyes you saw angelic fire , Pure from the dross , the dimming clouds of earth , Deem 'd now her frame ethereal , unakin To earth 's clay-moulded fabrics — such , perchance , As entering heaven , might have left its dust At the bright folding portals , sandal-like , And thence , repassing in seraphic trance , Still left unclaim 'd the vesture at the gate !</item>
     <item>ROGER .</item>
     <item>You glory in her weakness ! ‘ Tis too much — Rash man , beware , a bitter end will come .</item>
     <item>MAURICE .</item>
     <item>I fain would think that study hath o'erwrought Your heated brain to this short fever fit , That soon may pass and leave your vision clear . In truth , I note strange changes in your mien — A wandering glance , quick , restless eagerness , Rapt snatches of deep thought , wherein the mind Seems cleaving heaven with wild extatic wings : Your cheeks are pale , and all your nervous frame Thrills ‘ neath some strange enthusiastic touch . Lay by your books awhile , and breathe again , As in those days gone by , the country air , The sweet , calm country air , where perfume floats Like love that finds no heart so godlike large Can clasp it wholly in its one embrace , But overflows creation with its bliss . Thus shall you quickly exorcise this madness , And cleanse your brain of these pernicious dreams .</item>
     <item>ORAN .</item>
     <item>This madness ! I bethink me of the past , Of all the great and noble who have toil 'd Amid the deep dark mines of burning thought , Wearing out life to quarry forth the Truth ; Of all the seers and watchers , early and late Waiting with eager blood-hot eyes the light Rising afar in some untrodden East , Full of divine and precious influence , Calling , like Mezzuin from his minaret , The thankless world to worship and be glad ; Of all the patient thinkers of the earth Who talk 'd with Wisdom like familiar friends , Until their voices unaccustom 'd grew , And men stared blankly at them as they pass 'd : I do bethink me of them all , and know How each walk 'd through his labyrinth of scorn , And was accounted mad before all men . But patience !— Winter bears within its breast The nascent seeds of golden harvest-time .</item>
     <item>This only shall I tell you of my ways — Straying , now here , now there , ‘ mid science ’ wealth , I have discover 'd a vast hidden power — A power that perfected shall surely work Great revolution in all human laws ,— Where stop its courses I as yet know not ; ‘ Tis to me like the sun , that all the day Shines godlike in my vision , and , at night , Though darkness hide its brightness , still , I feel , Shines on in glory over other spheres ; It is a power beneficent and good , That grants to spirit infinite control Over all matter , and that frees the soul From its flesh shackles , and its sensuous means . What else its influences , or for health , For happiness , or blessing , I say not — Save that such glimpses of vast powers unknown Dawn on my wondering mind , that like a man Standing upon some giddy pinnacle , With a whole world seen faint and small below , I close mine eyes for very fear and joy . To her , my Mabel , do I bear in love Some first-fruits of my finding — make her rich , That , gazing through her eyes , I may behold How sweet is heaven , how dear is happiness . This is the sum of that I work on her ; Then , though I thank you for your good intent , Leave me untroubled to my life of thought , Leave her all trustful in the arms of love .</item>
     <item>ROGER .</item>
     <item>You love her not , false man ! your heart and soul Are steep 'd in science till not e'en the heel , Achilles-like , is vulnerable left . Ay ! wear thus feeling 's semblance as you will , Pale visionary ! no more shall I pause , But with strong hand arrest your mad career ! Soon we return arm 'd with a father 's power , To snatch our sister from your fearful arts .</item>
     <item>MAURICE .</item>
     <item>Oh ! if you love her , Sir , as once you did — If yet upon the dial of your life Her sun mark out the short sweet hours of joy , And all too swiftly on the shadows glide — If yet you prize the loving heart you hold , From this most mad delusion waken up , That blindly blights her whom it seeks to bless ; Cease your Utopian and unsafe essays , And rather turn your studious care to call The fading roses back into her cheeks , And shed health 's gladness on her feeble frame ; Reflect whilst yet you may , lest late Remorse Stalk , ghost-like , through the chambers of your soul , Haunting their gloomy void for evermore .</item>
     <item>[ Exeunt Maurice and Roger .</item>
     <item>SCENE II .— The Same .</item>
     <item>ORAN .</item>
     <item>ORAN .</item>
     <item>Not love her ! O my God ! thou knowest me — Thou , looking through me as the sun at noon That searches through the being of the world — Thou setting life against thy glory light , As men hold up a crystal ‘ gainst the sun , Making its frame as nothing in the blaze !</item>
     <item>Lo ! my heart was like a chaotic world , Still , silent , ‘ mid the dreary waste of time . Man there was not in all its desert bounds , But hoary ruins of past wondrous things , Old unbeliefs , fierce doubts , unsightly dreams , That wearing out their wild hot-breathing life , Wearily stretch 'd their writhing shapes to die ; Then came she moving o'er my awe-hush 'd soul , Like God 's own Spirit over earth 's void waters , And there arose order and life through all . She was my sun , set high to rule the day , And make my world all bright and beautiful ; She was my moon , amid the stilly night Subduing darkness with her quiet smiles , And stealing softly through my anxious dreams , A sweet-soul 'd hostage for departed day ; She was my summer , clothing all my life With fragrant blossoms of delight and joy .</item>
     <item>[ A pause .</item>
     <item>Not love her ! ‘ Tis as yesterday the time When first my love stole fainting to her ear , In deep scarce-worded murmurs of desire . ‘ Twas evening , and above the weary land Silence lay dreaming in a golden hush ; The summer 's sunset yellow 'd in the wheat , And the ripe year , with harvest promise full , Slept on the wavy slopes and verdant leas , Like one who through long hours of toil at last Sees the glad work accomplish 'd , and in peace Flings him along the meadows to repose ; Below , the bells of even faintly chimed , And sent their hymnal music up the breeze To where I stood , half-praying , by her side . Then all my words and thoughts that came and went , Waving about the secret of my love , Like billows plashing on a silent shore , All at one gush flow 'd from me o'er her heart , And broke the banks of silence ; then my love Sank through her liquid eyes to read her soul , Like diver that through waving water-floods Seeketh the priceless pearl that lies below , And there found life — found joy for evermore : It is as yesterday that time to me ,— Sweet time , when love entwines the locks of life With fragrant blossoms , like a one-hour 's bride , And claspeth summer with soft pleading arms , That she , though ne'er so eager to be gone , Still tarries smiling for a last embrace , And drops her hoarded flowers upon the way : It is as yesterday — my love the same — The love that led me through all heavy tasks , All lonely watchings by the midnight lamp , To win the fame that still might shine on her ; And e'en — how dear the thought !— this wondrous power , This godlike influence which has dawn 'd on me , Thus from my love takes colouring and aim ! Not love her ! Well , well , I 'll forget the word — The sun shines on , though blind eyes see it not .</item>
     <item>[ A pause .</item>

    <docImprint>It cannot be — this aim so deeply — weigh 'd , So long and calmly sifted , cannot fail . O wondrous power ! great mystery of life ! Reserved for me of all the sons of men ; Fruit ripening high upon the wall of heaven For me to pluck with eager , trembling hands , And press its vintage out for thirsting worlds More blessed still that into her sweet cup First may I pour the clearest of the wine — For her — for her — ah , yes ! for her supreme , I struggle onward through this blinding light , E'en at whose dazzling threshold I might stand , Pale , trembling , like a terror-smitten soul , Waiting bewilder 'd at the gate of heaven . Yet once again let me the plan review , Searching within my soul of souls each part , That doubt or danger , lurking there , may thus By love 's keen-scented instincts hunted be .—</docImprint>
    <epigraph>
     <p>[ A long pause . Yes ! it is so — this deep magnetic sleep , That from my being passes upon her , Bindeth the body close in deepest thrall , But setteth free the soul . What real need Hath spirit of these sensuous avenues , Through which the soul looks feebly on the world ? This power then opes the prison door awhile , And sends the spirit chainless o'er the earth . This know I — without eyes the spirit sees , Gains instant cognizance of hidden things , And counts all space for nothing ; knowledge comes Upon it with the falling of the flesh , So that there is no thing in earth or heaven But to the unhoused spirit native is — The mantle falls and leaves the Prophet angel ! Body , then , is the prison-house of soul , And freedom is its highest happiness , Its heaven , its primal being full of joy . This power that holdeth thus the keys of life , Can then at will give moments of release , Which to the soul are as the water-brooks That scantly rise amid a sun-scorch 'd waste : These , oft repeated , must at length destroy The thraldom of the flesh , and give at will A freer issue to the practised soul — At lowest gladden it with gleams of bliss , Glimpses of heaven amid this exile time . Yes ! thus , my Mabel , shall thy prison 'd soul Rise to its sister angels heavenward still ; And soon the mortal fetters shall hang loose , Scarce clogging aught its motions glad and free . Thus shall thy young fair frame no longer be A prison , but a meetest dwelling-place , Full of all infinite delights , and dear As is its nest to the heaven-soaring lark , That yearns down , singing , to it from the sky . These men , did they not see it in thine eyes , Amazed and fearful at the dazzling sight , As some rude passer gazing up aloft Sees from some casement , unawares , a face That makes his great rough heart on sudden rock With wonder and with worship — in her frame Did they not see the mortal waxing faint , The immortal fusing it with heavenly fire ? Ay ! the charm works , and thou , my life , my love , Reapest the first-fruits of my long , long toil . SCENE III .— A Boudoir . Flowers about it , in beautifully shaped Vases . A Greenhouse at one end . The window-panes delicately tinted , and hung with light fleecy draperies . MABEL working , and singing in a low voice . MABEL ( singing ) . At night when stars shine bright and clear , The soft winds on the casements blow , And round the chamber rustle low , Like one unseen , whose voice we hear , On tiptoe stealing to and fro — At night when clouds are dark and drear , They moan about the lattice sore , And murmur sighs for evermore , That fill us with a chilly fear , Oft glancing at the well-barr 'd door — At night , in moonlight or in gloom , They wander round the drooping thatch , Like some poor exile thence to catch Fond glimpses of each well-loved room , And sigh beside the unraised latch — O unseen Wind ! art thou alone , Thus breathing round the sleeping land ? Or roams with thee a spirit band , Blending sad voices with thine own ,— Voices that once with cheerful tone Made music round the sleeping land ? ORAN ( from the Greenhouse , unperceived ) . Ah ! her dear voice . How all my nature thrills , My heart , my brain , beneath the mellow sound , Like some great dome with holy music fill 'd ! She is the lark , above my listening soul Hovering still with carols from Heaven 's gate . She is the perfumed breeze , that evermore Sweeps music from the Aeolian strings of life . She is the sea , that fills with sweetest sound The yearning earth that folds it in its arms . Not love her — Ah ! dear heart , how utterly ! [ A pause . What if amid these spirit wanderings , This so mysterious power can grant at will ,— What if the angels , smitten with her grace , Woo 'd her away for ever from my heart ? The dove came twice again unto the ark , With messages of peace , and hope , and joy , But the third time return 'd not . She 's my dove — Oh ! wing 'd she ever from my longing heart , The waters of my life would quick subside , And leave me stranded on the shoals of Time . What if God saw her hovering aloft , And smiled her in amongst his cherubim ? What if the draught of bliss should , Lethe-like , Blot me for ever from her memory , So that she sought me never , never more ? Oblivion ! take again this fearful power — No more shall Fate be tempted with my wealth , Lest covetous it rob me of my all . [ A pause . And yet , these are but dreams , poor selfish fears , That scum-like float and dim Love 's limpid tide . Shall I thus cage my bird from liberty , And let it beat its life out on the bars , Lest some dear bliss detain it in the heavens ? Shall I spill rashly forth this wine of joy , Because for me within the crystal cup Some dregs may haply rest when she has drunk ? Ah , no ! for her alone shall I take thought . The first pure sacrifice of Love is self ! There is no peril . God that sends the power Will send the guardian angel to direct . I work for her — Heaven speed the work of love . [ Enters the room . MABEL . I waited for thee , love — ‘ tis past the hour , And on my dial slumbers Time in shade When thou comest not to sun me . ORAN . I but stood There on the threshold , following thy voice Away , away through mazy lengths of dreams . Music — low music from the lips we love , Is the true siren that still lures the soul From cares of earth to the Enchanted Isles . MABEL . Methinks that thou art sad to-day , my husband . Let me share with thee pain as well as joy ; It is the sweetest right that love can claim . We give our joys to strangers , but our grief Sighs itself only forth for those we love . We hang our sorrows on the loved one 's ear , Like jewell 'd pendents for a bridal feast . ORAN . Tell me , my Mabel , if within this sleep , To which mine art oft leads thee , there should come Some angel bright with Heaven 's reflected light , Wooing thee upward with the songs of bliss ,— Tell me , my Mabel , wouldst thou freely go , Leaving this fair earth-vesture only here , Leaving me lornly gazing on the sky , Blotting its sun out with my blinding tears ? MABEL . There is no angel but the angel Death Could sever me from thee who art all my life ! What Heaven is there but that which Love creates ? What songs of Bliss , save those by Love intoned ? Ah ! thou to me art as the sun to Day , That dies out with its setting utterly — Thou art the ever-flowing crystal spring , That keeps the fountain of my being full — Thou art the heart that beats with measured pulse The joyous moments of my flowing life — Leave thee ? How canst thou wrong me with the thought ? ORAN . Dear Mabel !— Yet to-day thy brothers came , Taxing me harshly , and in cruel terms , With practising against thy precious life . MABEL . Oh , Heaven ! ORAN . They dread these trances , whose dim fame Hath floated on the ignorant air to them . They deem this priceless power , new-fall'n on me , And treasured for thy sake , my best beloved , A most pernicious art , that may , perchance , Work evil upon thee ; say , dost thou fear ? My Mabel , hast thou faith and trust in me ? Shall I proceed , or break this magic wand , Wherewith they deem that I am dower 'd withal ? MABEL . I trust in thee , my love , with perfect faith — Am I not as the floating gossamer , Steering through ether on thy guiding breath ? Am I not as the clay within thy hand , Taking the shape and image of thy thought ? Heed not these idle tongues , that launch their doubts In erring love against thy watchful care . That which thou doest I accept with joy ; I wait for thee as waits a full-sail 'd bark The coming breeze to waft it o'er the sea . ORAN . Fear not ! I do well think no peril lies Within this power , but virtue of rare worth , Else nevermore its wand had waved o'er thee .— Tell me , dost bring no memory back to Earth Of all these glorious wanderings above ? No certain visions of the hidden things Thou seest in that far mystic spirit-land ? MABEL . Nay ! it must be as thou dost tell me oft , The soul doth lose its secrets at Earth 's gate , And all the blinding glories it hath known Shed but their mystic influence over life . Therefore , it may be , ‘ tis I nought retain Of that which passeth in these hours of trance . ORAN . Yet strive once more to grasp the fleeting dreams , Else shall I doubt that which I fondly hope .— Sleep , love , and let thy spirit bask awhile In Heaven 's own sunshine ;— yet forget not me ! [ Makes passes over her , which shortly sink her into a state of trance . ‘ Tis done ! she 's free ! and now this lovely frame Lies tenantless , a casket whose pure gems Now sparkle ‘ mid the opal lights of Heaven . This earth seems very lone and cold to me Now she is absent , though a little space ! My heart goes restless wandering around , Seeking her through old haunts and vacant nooks , Like one who , waking from some troubled dream , Findeth his love soft stolen from his side , And straightway seeketh in a dim amaze All through the moonlight for her straying feet . [ A pause . Where art thou , O my dove ! about the sky ? Ruffling thy breast across what honey breeze ? Flashing white pinions ‘ gainst the golden sun , That fain would nest thee on his ardent breast ? Art thou soft floating through the joys of Heaven , With Earth far , far beneath thee , like a star Struggling up through the tremulous sea of light , That sucks its life down from the eye of day ? About the gate of Heaven there floats my dove , Fann 'd by the breath of melodies divine ; Opes there no casement soft to take her in , And lay her in the bosom of delight ? O dove , white dove , now at the gate of Heaven ! Wilt thou wing homeward ere the eventide , On shining pinions to thine own soft nest ? [ A pause . O wonderful ! Thou mansion tenantless , Unswept by memory , untrod by thought , Where all lies tranced in motionless repose ; No whisper stirring round the silent place , No foot of guest across the startled halls , No rustling robes about the corridors , No voices floating on the waveless air , No laughters , no sweet songs like angel dreams On silver wings among the archèd domes ,— No swans upon the mere — no golden prow , Parting the crystal tide to Pleasure 's breeze ,— No flapping sail before the idle wind ,— No music pulsing out its great wild heart In sweetest passion-beats the noontide through ,— No lovers gliding down sun-chequer 'd glades , In dreams that open wide the Eden gate , And waft them past the guardian Seraphim . Sleep over all the Present and the Past — The Future standing idle at the gate , Gazing amazed , like one who , in hot haste Bearing great tidings to some palace porch , Findeth the place deserted . [ A noise without ; enter in haste Father , Maurice and Roger . How now ?— Friends , you are welcome ! FATHER . Where 's my child , That you maltreat , most rash and guilty man ? ORAN . Sir , you are over hasty in your words — Your child is here .— [ Points to Mabel , who still lies entranced . FATHER . Mabel ! wake , Mabel — O my God ! she 's dead ! MAURICE . How !— Dead ! ROGER . Ay , murder 'd ! FATHER . O ! my child ! my child ! ORAN . Peace ! she is well — Sleep folds her in his arms , And each upheaving of his drowsy breast Is like a billow upon pleasure 's sea , Wafting her on to far Hesperides . FATHER . This is no healthy sleep that wraps her now , Else would she waken at my anxious cry ; ‘ Tis death-sleep , wretched man . MAURICE . Let 's bear her hence . ROGER . Nay ! let him now unwind his magic spells , Or fall our vengeance on his guilty head . ORAN . Dismiss your fears , and cease your threats . Old man , Soon shall I prove how much you wrong my love ; Thus do I call the spirit home again , And wave the slumber backward from her eyes . [ Makes passes to awaken her , but without effect after long persistence . FATHER . Impostor ! would you mock e'en Death itself , Calling it sleep !— You see , Death mocks you back . MAURICE . In vain ! no further seek to blind our fears . ORAN . ‘ Tis strange !... stand back , Sirs ... ‘ tis your influence Hath neutralized my power — stand off , I say ! [ Continuing the passes in great agitation . ROGER .</p>

    <docTitle><titlePart>By Heaven !— It is too much — Let fall the mask ! O villain ! you have done your worst at last , And ta'en the sweetest life in all the land ; But vengeance swift shall follow on your track . ORAN . Hold ! hold ! young man , talk not of vengeance here ; This sleep shall pass and shame your blood-hot words — If it pass 'd not the vengeance were forestall 'd . [ A silence — continuing the passes . O Mabel ! Mabel ! hear me where thou art ! Come to the lonely heart that yearns for thee ,— Come to the eyes that seek thee through salt tears ! Patience , Sirs , now methinks the sense returns ; A smile steals o'er her lips , and roseate hues Make morning on her downy cheek again : Back ... back — my anguish shall unwind the charm !</titlePart></docTitle>
    <epigraph>
     <p>[ A silence . FATHER . Sir , I acquit you — pity you — perceive You loved her , and have err 'd against yourself ; But cease these struggles that but mock us now , They nought avail — my child is dead !... ORAN . Mabel ! Mabel ! HEBE . Life 's chalice is empty — pour in ! pour in ! What ?— Pour in Strength ! Strength for the struggle through good and ill ; Through good — that the soul may be upright still , Unspoil 'd by riches , unswerving in will , To walk by the light of unvarnish 'd truth , Up the flower-border 'd path of youth ;— Through ill — that the soul may stoutly hold Its faith , its freedom through hunger and cold , Steadfast and pure as the true men of old . Strength for the sunshine , strength for the gloom , Strength for the conflict , strength for the tomb ; Let not the heart feel a craven fear — Draw from the fountain deep and clear ; Brim up Life 's chalice — pour in ! pour in ! Pour in Strength ! Life 's chalice is empty — pour in ! pour in ! What — Pour in Truth ! Drink ! till the mists that enshroud the soul , Like sleep 's drowsy shadows backward roll , And show the spirit its radiant goal , That nought may blind it all its days , Or tempt it down earth 's crooked ways ; Drink ! till the soul in the eastern skies Behold the glorious star arise , That guides its steps to the promised prize ; Drink ! till the strong elixir fire Each aim of the being with pure desire , Nerve the courage to dare the world , Though a thousand scoffers their arrows hurl 'd ; Brim up Life 's chalice — pour in ! pour in ! Pour in Truth ! Life 's chalice is empty — pour in ! pour in ! What ?— Pour in Love ! To quench the thirst of the longing heart , Heal all its sorrows with wondrous art , And freshness and joy to its hopes impart ; To make the blossoms of life expand , And shed their sweetness on every hand ; To melt the frost of each sullen mood , Cement the bond of true brotherhood , Subdue the evil of Time with good , And join the links which death hath riven Betwixt this fallen sphere and Heaven , Raising the soul above the sky On wings of Immortality . Brim up Life 's chalice — pour in ! pour in ! Pour in Love ! Life 's chalice is empty — pour in ! pour in ! What ?— Pour in Hope ! The soul looks out through the coming years , Blinded by doubts , and blinded by tears , Sear 'd with the iron of tyrant fears :— Is there a break in Life 's gloomy sky ? Can the heart reach it before it die ? The path is weary , the desert wide , And Sorrow stalks by the pilgrim 's side — Oh for a draught of Hope 's crystal tide To cheer the parch 'd and fainting one , Until his toilsome race be run , And the bright mirage fall from the sky , Displaced by a sweet reality . Brim up Life 's chalice — pour in ! pour in ! Pour in Hope ! Life 's chalice is empty — pour in ! pour in ! What ?— Pour in Faith ! What is Life 's fabric , so nobly plann 'd , Its stately dome , and its ramparts grand , If their foundation rest on the sand , Ready to shift with Time 's ebbing stream , And melt away like a gorgeous dream ? God ! let us trust Thee in very sooth , Feel that the visions , the dreams of youth , Its glorious hopes are all based on Truth ;— Thus shall the purpose of Life grow clear ; Love shall be freed from the bondage of fear ; And the soul calmly await the morrow Untroubled by visions of coming sorrow . Brim up Life 's chalice — pour in ! pour in ! Pour in Faith ! SPRING . On , like a giant , stalketh the strong Wind , Wrapping the clouds about him , close and dark , Rifting Creation 's soul , for rage is blind ,— No pity hath he for the Earth all stark , Shivering beneath the loose and drifting snow , A scanty shroud to hide the dead below . Dead ? There is life within the mother 's breast — So claspeth she her young ones to her heart ;— “ The time will come — the time will come — rest ! rest ! Let the mad greybeard to his North depart ; Earth shall arise and mock him in his grave — Patience a little , let the dotard rave ! ” The palsied boughs grew still — there came a pause , And Nature 's heart scarce beat for listening , Gazing abroad from all the tempest-flaws , With prayerful longing for the saviour Spring ; And when she heard Spring coming up the sky , Earth rose and threw her shroud off joyfully . Then she who once had wept like Niobe , Beheld her children springing round her feet , Raising young voices in the early day , That never to her ear had seem 'd so sweet ; And the soft murmur of a thousand rills Proclaim 'd how Spring had loosed them on the hills . The bright Evangel came , girt round with mirth , And garlanded with youth , and crown 'd with flowers “ Awake ! arise ! ye sons of the new birth , And move to the quick measure of the hours ! Summer is coming — go ye forth to meet her , With sweetest hymeneal songs to greet her . ” So there arose straightway a joyous train , Gather 'd by every nook and hedgerow shade , That in its passage o'er the verdant plain , ‘ Still in the heart a thrilling music made — Sweet pilgrims they of Love in youth 's gay time , Leading the year on to its golden prime . The birds sang homage to her evermore ; And myriad wingèd things , whose radiant dyes Made sunshine beautiful , still hover 'd o'er , And bore her witness in the sunlit skies ; And rising from the tomb in glad amaze , Came many a sainted flower to hymn her praise . Thus from the streams , and rivers , from the sea , From the stirr 'd bosom of the mighty hills , From every glade there rose continually A blessing for her , till with joyous thrills Earth 's bosom heaved , and in man 's heart a voice Echoed the anthem — “ Spring is come ! Rejoice ! ” THE BITTERN . The reeds are idly waving o'er the marshy ground , The rank and ragged herbage rots on many a mound , And desolate pools and marshes deadly lie around . There is no life nor motion , save the winds that fly With the close-muffled clouds in silence through the sky , There is no sound to stir it , save the Bittern 's cry ; The Bittern , sitting sadly on the fluted edges Of pillars once the prop and pride of palace ledges , Now smear 'd with damp decay and sunk in slimy sedges ; Shatter 'd and sunken , with the sculptured architrave Peering above the surface of the sluggish wave , Like a gaunt limb thrust fleshless from a shallow grave . The Bittern sitteth sadly on the time-worn stone , Upon life 's mouldering relics , fearfully alone , Searing the silence ofttimes with his solemn tone . The Bittern — monarch of the sad and dreary place , Mocking the pride and pageant of a ruin 'd race , Whose very name 's forgotten , and whose deeds have left no trace . The pleasant songs of peace , the lute , the lover 's sigh , The statesman 's eloquence , the warrior 's battle-cry Have pass 'd ,— and like their echo from the heedless sky , The lonely Bittern 's note comes sadly floating by . Oh , melancholy sound ! Shall thus for ever end The glory and the greatness whither all hopes tend , And as the Past comes booming shall the Present wend ? No ear to listen to the old and hard-earn 'd glory , That wore the heart out , made the locks grow scant and hoary , No ear to listen , and no tongue to tell the story ! The Bittern sitteth ‘ midst the marshes of the Past , Sitteth amidst the ruins , whilst the hours fleet fast , And at his own hoarse cry he looketh round aghast . The hours fleet fast unnoted , and the time is nigh , When even he on noiseless wings shall soar on high , Till his deep note is lost amid the azure sky . GONE . The night is dark , and evermore The thick drops patter on the pane The wind is weary of the rain , And round the thatches moaneth sore ; Dark is the night , and cold the air ; And all the trees stand stark and bare , With leaves spread dank and sere below , Slow rotting on the plashy clay , In the God'shYpppHeNacre far away , Where she , O God ! lies cold below — Cold , cold below ! And many a bitter day and night Have pour 'd their storms upon her breast , And chill 'd her in her long , long rest , With foul corruption 's icy blight ; Earth 's dews are freezing round the heart , Where love alone so late had part ; And evermore the frost and snow Are burrowing downward through the clay , In the God'shYpppHeNacre far away , Where she , O God ! lies cold below ,— Cold , cold below ! Those eyes so full of light are dim ; And the clear chalice of her youth , All sparkling up with love and truth , Hath Death drain 'd keenly from the brim ;— No more can mortal ear rejoice In the soft music of her voice ; No wistful eye , through tears of woe , Can pierce down through the heavy clay , In the God'shYpppHeNacre far away , Where she , O God ! lies cold below ,— Cold , cold below . A star shines , sudden , from the sky — God 's angel cometh , pure and bright , Making a radiance through the night , Unto the place where , mute , I lie , Gazing up in rapt devotion , Shaken by a deep emotion ; And my thoughts no longer go Wandering o'er the plashy clay , In the God'shYpppHeNacre far away , Where she , O God ! lay cold below — Cold , cold below ! God 's angel ! ah I divinely bright ! But still the olden grace is there — The soft brown eyes — the raven hair — The gentle smile of calm delight , That could such peace and joy impart — The veil is rent from off my heart , And gazing upward , well I know The rain may beat upon the clay In the God'shYpppHeNacre far away ; But she no longer lies below , Enshrouded by the frost and snow — Cold , cold below ! BEATRICE DI TENDA . 1 . It was too sweet — such dreams do ever fade When Sorrow shakes the sleeper from his rest — Life still to me hath been a masquerade , Woe in Mirth 's wildest , gayest mantle drest , With the heart hidden — but the face display 'd . But now the vizard droppeth , crush 'd and torn , And there is nought left but some tinsell 'd rags , To mock the wearer in the face of morn , As through the gaping world she feebly drags Her day-born measure of reproach and scorn . But that his hand should pluck the dream away — And thus — and thus — O Heaven ! it strikes too deep ! The knife that wounds me , if not meant to slay , Stumbles upon my heart the while I weep : So be it ; no hand of mine its course shall stay . False ? false to him ? Release me — let me go Before Heaven 's judgment-seat to make appeal ; Unfold the records of this life , and show All that the secret pages can reveal , That Heaven and Earth the inmost truth may know ! He cannot think it in his heart of hearts ; He cannot wear this falsehood in his soul , Or deem me perjur 'd ; no delusive arts Can make him blot my name from honour 's scroll : The sun will shine forth when the cloud departs . Patience , my heart ! Error is quick , but Truth Moves slowly , but moves surely up the earth , Wiping from age the heresies of youth , And kindling warmth on the once blasted hearth : Patience , my heart ! and rage will turn to ruth . There is no blush upon my brow , though tears Are in mine eyes , and sorrow in my heart ; This sobbing breast heaves not with traitor fears : No sighs for sin are these that sadly start , And bear their bitter burden to thine ears . And though my woman 's strength bend like a reed Before the flowing of Affliction 's river , Not , not for shame , nor for one strumpet deed Doth this weak frame bow down , or faintly quiver , As I stand forth alone in deadly need . No ! before thee , Filippo , and the world , Cased in its petty panoply of scorn , With myriad slavish lips in mocking curl 'd , Spotless and innocent , though most forlorn , Here stand I , ‘ gainst the shafts Falsehood hath hurl 'd . 2 . Confess 'd ! Confess 'd the guilty act ! What act ? What act , my Lord , that cometh home to me Closer than each hot word , by torment rack 'd , Flies at the bidding of false tyranny , That makes at will the pain-wrung falsehood fact ? There are full many sins confess 'd , my Lord , In pain of body and in pain of soul ; Some from the heart unearth 'd by fire and sword , And stealing forth amid the spirit 's dole , With fiery pain-sweat seething every word ; But none , my Lord , that riseth to the sky , Bears guilt of mine upon its blister 'd tongue ; Though torture 's fire is quick to forge a lie , None from these woman 's lips could ere be wrung ; No ! none , though on the rack-bed bound to die . Poor youth ! This poison from his writhing throat , Those hellish instruments have haply drawn , And pain hath conn 'd the aspish lies by rote ; But to my heart no poison 'd tooth hath gnawn , For in its pulses lies Truth 's antidote . These limbs , my Lord , can do their task no more ; The rack hath crush 'd them in its wild embrace , So that Truth 's firm-set attitude is o'er , Else had I met my judges face to face , And challenged justice , as in days of yore . Yet is the spirit strong within me still , And bears me up though manhood 's strength succumb , Unbent by any blighting blast of ill , Through fiery trials , to all false witness dumb ; They cannot stain me , though perchance they kill ! I am a woman — weak to combat wrong , But innocent , my Lord , I live or die ; And silent , though my God doth tarry long , He sees me throughly with His holy eye , And in my sore , sore need , doth make me strong . This hapless youth ! I do forgive him all ; E'en now remorse must rankle in his breast , And no cool comfort cometh at his call , To set the tumult of his soul at rest : God 's pity on his human weakness fall ! 3 . Nay , falter not , good friend ; thy news is sweet ; Thanks , thanks ! Ay , sweet as is the welcome wind That wafts the calm-lock 'd seaman , smooth and fleet , O'er tropic seas unto his sigh'dhYpppHeNfor Ind ; Ay ! Death will bring rest to my weary feet ! ‘ Tis strange — but now the word falls on mine ear Soft as the singing of a little child , Heaven 's music on light pinions floateth near , Through all the strife of Earth , so harsh and wild ; Time 's stream is rippling on its marges clear . The end is nigh — the end of grief and pain , And Life 's broad gates are opening to my soul ; O'er my weak heart no more shall sorrow reign , Enfranchised soon ‘ twill spurn the harsh control , And never feel its empiry again . No more , Filippo , shall my hapless life Stand betwixt thee and pleasure ,— Duty 's knot Shall soon be sever 'd by the headsman 's knife ; And upon memory one crimson blot Shall be the record of a spotless wife . ‘ Tis well ! I would not wander through a haunted mind , Ghost-like and fearful in the evening hours ; Would God that I could leave my peace behind , To bless thee when the night of sorrow lours , And thou art rifted by Affliction 's wind ! Shouldst thou awake when I have pass 'd away , Shouldst thou see clear the error and the wrong , And Truth break on thee with its dazzling ray , As sure it will , for Innocence is strong , Then may my prayers thine every pang allay ! For thee , poor youth ,— go not unto the grave With a red lie upon thy trembling tongue — Not for myself , but for thy soul I crave ,— Death 's champions should have sinews tightly strung , And thou wilt falter where I shall be brave . In that dim world there flows no cooling stream , No Lethe for the guilty and the fever 'd , There is no answer to their parching scream , From hope and mercy they are ever sever 'd , There is no waking from their spectral dream . Then pause or e'er thou stampest on thy soul Eternally such misery as thine , And writest on God 's conscience-blasting scroll , A wife 's dishonour , and a tarnish 'd line , To weigh for thee thine everlasting dole ... Friend , let thine arm be strong , good sooth there 's need , Thou cuttest through a weary depth of woe !— Well ! that will pass , and soon rest come indeed ,— Ay , ay ! the robe 's white now ... will't long be so ?... Yet better far the crimson tide should flow , Than the heart inly with its anguish bleed . SERENADE . The day is fading from the sky , And softly shines the Star of Even , As watching with a lover 's eye The rest of Earth the peace of Heaven ; The dew is rising cool and sweet , And , zephyr-rock 'd , the flowers are closing , The Night steals on with noiseless feet , Oh ! gentle be my love 's reposing . The streamlet , as it flows along , Sounds like a voice ‘ mid childhood 's slumbers ; And from the brake the Queen of Song Pours forth her softest , clearest numbers ; And ever through the stirless leaves The summer moon is brightly streaming , Light fancies on the sward it weaves ,— As radiant be my lady 's dreaming . The silent hours move swiftly on , With many a blessed vision laden , That all the night has softly shone Upon the hearts of youth and maiden ; And now , in golden splendors drest , The new-born day is gladly breaking , Oh ! blissful be my lady 's rest , And sweet as Morn be her awaking . THE EAGLE . The winds sweep by him on his mountain throne , Hurling the clouds together at his feet , Till Earth is hidden , lost , and swallow 'd up As in the flood of waters ,— and he sits Eyeing the boundless firmament above , Proud and unruffled , till his heart exclaims ,— “ I am a god , Heaven is my home ,— the Earth Serveth me but for footstool . ” The strong winds Sweep on , and wide his pinions spreadeth he ,— “ Bear me afar ! ” and on the mighty storm He rides triumphant , spurning the dim Earth — Whither , O whither goest thou ? What star Shall raise its mountains for thee ? What far orb Echo the fierceness of thy battle-cry ? What dost thou when the thunder is unloosed ? “ I sit amongst the crags , and feel the Earth Tremble beneath me , whilst my heart is firm . I gaze upon the lightning , and my lid Quivers not . Is their aught ‘ neath which my gaze Quaileth , or waxeth faint — I read the sun Undazzled where the stars grow dim and pale . “ Men gather them to battle — host meets host — And I am borne aloft to marshal them ,— I , the great King of Battles , that go forth Conquering and to conquer . So do men Worship me . Oh ! the mighty crash ascends ,— The shoutings , and the glory , and the woe , One great full chaunt of homage to mine ears ,— And there I wait the while the sacrifice Is slain before me ; then down with a swoop I get me from my skyey throne , and dye Deep in the ruddy stream my talons grey — Hurrah ! hurrah ! blood red 's the flag for me ! ” The time will come , proud one , when thou shalt die ! “ Die ! Death I cast from me as these loose plumes That moult out from my pinions — let them go To Earth , and Death go with them , both I leave To mortals . What have I to do with Time ? Let him pat forth his speed — these wings of mine Shall match him stroke for stroke , until we reach The limits of his empire , and I shake him off Like dust upon the threshold of the world . ”</p>

       <l n="2">Llewellyn , baffled of his game , hied back ,</l>
       <l n="3">Striding right grimly in his discontent ,</l>
       <l n="4">And whistling , oft his spear upon the ground ,</l>
       <l n="5">Slaying the visions of his fretful dreams ;</l>
       <l n="6">And presently he thought him of his child :</l>
       <l n="7">So with its winsome ways to wile the time ,</l>

       <l n="9">Watch 'd o'er by Gelert , as his custom was :</l>

       <l n="12">Some sudden madness had embolden 'd it ,</l>
       <l n="13">He saw the child lie bloody mid the sheets ,</l>
       <l n="14">Slain by the hound , as it would seem , for there</l>
       <l n="15">Lay Gelert lapping from his chaps the blood ,</l>

       <l n="3">Of mortal labour startled the wild place ,</l>
       <l n="4">And only sea-mews with their wailing shrill ,</l>

       <l n="7">That glimmer 'd faintly in the gloomy light</l>
       <l n="8">Betwixt the foaming furrows constantly .</l>
       <l n="9">It was a mighty cape , that proudly rose</l>
       <l n="10">Above the world of waters , high and steep ,</l>
       <l n="11">With many a scar and fissure fathoms deep ,</l>
       <l n="12">Upon whose ledges lodged the endless snows ;</l>
       <l n="13">A noble brow to a firm-founded world ,</l>

       <l n="24">Went with the gathering wind , and let it die .</l>
       <l n="25">A moaning sound swept o'er the heaving ocean ,</l>
       <l n="26">Toss 'd hoarsely on from angry crest to crest ,</l>

       <l n="55">“ Then trust to me ; for though the sea be wild ,</l>
       <l n="56">It cannot shake the sinews of my strength ,—</l>
       <l n="57">Within my breast the fearful fall asleep ,</l>
       <l n="58">And wake out of their terrors , calm and still ,</l>
       <l n="59">Having outstripp 'd the speed of time and ill ,</l>
       <l n="60">And pass 'd unconsciously the stormy deep . ”</l>
       <l n="61">Quicker and quicker drew I in my breath ,</l>

       <l n="63">I 'll trust in thee — but , Spirit , who art thou ? ”</l>

      <head>THE GOLDEN WATER .</head>
      <note>It is scarcely necessary to say that the following fragment is founded upon the beautiful , and well-known tale in the “ Arabian Nights , ” entitled , “ The two Sisters who were jealous of their younger Sister ; ” and the reader need only be reminded that the two brothers of Perizade , Bahman and Perviz , had previously gone in search of the treasures described by the Devotee , and had perished in the attempt ,— the fate of the latter having just been intimated to her at the commencement of this episode , by the fixture of the pearls in the magic chaplet , which Perviz had left her for that purpose .</note>

       <l n="4">The days flow 'd on — one morn the pearls ran not ,</l>
       <l n="5">And well she knew that Perviz too was lost .</l>
       <l n="6">Tears doubled every bead ; but , evermore ,</l>
       <l n="7">Through pain and sorrow , yearn 'd her thirsting soul</l>

       <l n="9">Whence one bright drop would fill her fountain full ,</l>
       <l n="10">With glistening jets still rising in the midst .</l>
       <l n="11">She rose up straight , and donning man 's attire ,</l>
       <l n="12">For that the road was hard and difficult ,</l>
       <l n="13">Took horse , and towards the sunrise swiftly rode ,</l>
       <l n="14">Saying , “ Thus much life lacks of perfectness ,</l>

       <l n="41">With sad dissenting mien , and solemn voice ,</l>
       <l n="42">That trembled ‘ neath its burden , thus spake he ,—</l>

       <l n="61">In fury , or in fear , to meet the foe</l>
       <l n="62">Shouting loud threats e'en in his very ear ,</l>

       <l n="64">Into cold stone , ‘ mongst myriads more that lie ,</l>
       <l n="65">And all day fright him with their dreary stare .</l>
       <l n="66">Ay ! he that setteth forth upon this quest ,</l>
       <l n="67">And looketh ever back for friend or foe ,</l>
       <l n="68">For cruel laughter , or for mocking jeers ,</l>
       <l n="69">Turns straight to stone like all beside his path ;</l>
       <l n="70">But once upon the summit , at his feet</l>
       <l n="71">Flows the pure Golden Water , bright and clear . ”</l>

      <head>GUY OF WARWICK .</head>
      <head>AN EPISODE .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Autumn went faintly flying o'er the land ,</l>
       <l n="2">Trailing her golden hair along the West ,</l>
       <l n="3">Weeping to find her waving fields despoil 'd ,</l>
       <l n="4">Her yellow leaves all floating on the wind :</l>
       <l n="5">And Winter grim came stalking from the North .</l>
       <l n="6">Around the coast rough blasts began to blow ,</l>
       <l n="7">And toss the seas about in giant sport ,</l>
       <l n="8">Lurking without to catch unwary sails ,</l>
       <l n="9">And snap their bellying seams against the mast .</l>
       <l n="10">So Guy lay idly waiting in the port ,</l>
       <l n="11">Gazing out eastward through the stormy mist ,</l>
       <l n="12">Gazing out eastward morn and closing eve ,</l>
       <l n="13">Seeking some break amid the hurtling clouds .</l>
       <l n="14">But many days the same wind strongly blew ,</l>
       <l n="15">Keeping his bark close moor 'd within the bay ,</l>
       <l n="16">Jerking the cable , like a restive steed .</l>
       <l n="17">And waiting thus impatient to be gone ,</l>
       <l n="18">Looking out seaward from the dripping wharf ,</l>
       <l n="19">Strange rumours fill 'd his ears , from inland come ,</l>
       <l n="20">How all the land around his native place</l>
       <l n="21">Was devastated by a mighty Beast ,</l>
       <l n="22">Most terrible to see , and passing strong .</l>
       <l n="23">They told him how it slew both man and brute ,</l>
       <l n="24">Destroying every living thing around ,</l>
       <l n="25">And laying waste the land for many a mile ;</l>
       <l n="26">And how ‘ twas thought no blade , by mortal wrought ,</l>
       <l n="27">Could cleave its way into the monster 's heart ;</l>
       <l n="28">And then they told him how his lord the King</l>
       <l n="29">Had late proclaim 'd through all the country round ,</l>
       <l n="30">That whosoe'er should slay the noisome Beast ,</l>
       <l n="31">Should straight be knighted by his kingly sword ,</l>
       <l n="32">And honour 'd greatly in the rescued land .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="33">Yet none was found so stout of heart and limb ,</l>
       <l n="34">To venture in this perilous emprize ;</l>
       <l n="35">“ But ah ! ” they said , supposing him far off ,</l>
       <l n="36">“ If famous Guy were here , there were a man</l>
       <l n="37">Would rid us of this monster presently .</l>
       <l n="38">But as for him , he speeds away through France ,</l>
       <l n="39">Bearing to other lands his strength , that , faith ,</l>
       <l n="40">Were better spent at home amongst his kin . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="41">And still the East wind bluster 'd to the shore .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="42">Now Guy , whose ears still tingled all the day</l>
       <l n="43">With these strange murmurs of the troubled land ,</l>
       <l n="44">Began to feel his heart with pity move ;</l>
       <l n="45">And , for his soul still fretted at delay ,</l>
       <l n="46">Like a leash 'd hound that scents the flying game ,</l>
       <l n="47">He straight resolved to take this quarrel up ,</l>
       <l n="48">And for his country 's weal to slay the Beast .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="49">So he arose , girt on his trusty sword ,</l>
       <l n="50">And with his bow and quiver slung behind ,</l>
       <l n="51">And at his belt his mighty battle-axe ,</l>
       <l n="52">Rode calmly forth to slay the hurtful Beast .</l>
       <l n="53">And no man knew that he was Guy , for all</l>
       <l n="54">Believed him far away on foreign shores ;</l>
       <l n="55">Which pleased him passing well , “ Because , ” he said ,</l>
       <l n="56">“ I do this thing for Phoelice and the King ,</l>
       <l n="57">And none shall know but Heaven that sees the deed .</l>
       <l n="58">But when the country feels returning joy ,</l>
       <l n="59">Her heart will flutter with a secret thought . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="60">And all the land was desolate and waste ;</l>
       <l n="61">The fields stood rotting ‘ neath the Autumn rains ,</l>
       <l n="62">And no man pluckt the sodden corn that lay ,</l>
       <l n="63">Dead ripe , along the furrows ‘ mid the weeds ;</l>
       <l n="64">No cattle browsed upon the long rank grass ,</l>
       <l n="65">Or paused to gaze upon him as he rode ;</l>
       <l n="66">The cottages , deserted all in haste ,</l>
       <l n="67">Stood open-door 'd and rifted by the winds ,</l>
       <l n="68">With cold grey ashes scatter 'd o'er the hearth .</l>
       <l n="69">Here he beheld the homely meal spread forth ,</l>
       <l n="70">Which no man ate ; and there , upon the floor ,</l>
       <l n="71">An o'erturn ' d cradle , whence a mother late</l>
       <l n="72">Had snatch 'd her babe up with a cry , and fled .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="73">And all his heart was sore with what he saw ,</l>
       <l n="74">For he met none to wish him once “ God speed ; ”</l>
       <l n="75">So he spurr 'd onward swifter to the place</l>
       <l n="76">Where lurk 'd the monster that thus spoil 'd the land ;</l>
       <l n="77">And long the road seem 'd to him in his wrath .</l>
       <l n="78">At last he came unto the fearful spot ,</l>
       <l n="79">Mark 'd with the blanching bones of man and beast ;</l>
       <l n="80">A thicket planted by a lonely heath ,</l>
       <l n="81">O'ergrown with brambles and unwholesome weeds ,</l>
       <l n="82">That clasping trees around with witch-like arms ,</l>
       <l n="83">Poison 'd their life out , and still held them dead .</l>
       <l n="84">And at one side there stretch 'd a stagnant pool ,</l>
       <l n="85">Unstirr 'd by any grateful breeze , but thick</l>
       <l n="86">With slimy leaves , and rushes all forlorn ,</l>
       <l n="87">And every footstep on the spongy bank</l>
       <l n="88">Fill 'd straightway with the oozing of decay .</l>
       <l n="89">The Beast hid in the bosom of this wood ;</l>
       <l n="90">And as Guy went he saw two eyes of fire</l>
       <l n="91">Burn through the darkness of the wood , like blasts</l>
       <l n="92">Sent from a smith 's forge suddenly at night .</l>
       <l n="93">But , nought dismay 'd , he bent his bow of steel ,</l>
       <l n="94">And sent an arrow whirring through the leaves .</l>
       <l n="95">He heard the shaft ring on the monster 's ribs ,</l>
       <l n="96">And backward leap , as when a falchion strikes</l>
       <l n="97">Full on a warrior 's casque with fiery force ;</l>
       <l n="98">Whereat with roaring horrible to hear ,</l>
       <l n="99">Like storm-winds belching through a cavern 's mouth ,</l>
       <l n="100">Forth rush 'd the monster , furious and grim ,</l>
       <l n="101">With open jaws and reeking breath at Guy ;</l>
       <l n="102">Who , leaping nimbly back , put forth his strength ,</l>
       <l n="103">And struck her full between the eyes a blow</l>
       <l n="104">That made the stout axe quiver in his hand .</l>
       <l n="105">But , nothing hurt , the madden 'd Beast rush 'd on ,</l>
       <l n="106">And nigh o'erwhelm ' d him in her headlong course ,</l>
       <l n="107">Denting his breastplate , wrought of temper 'd steel ,</l>
       <l n="108">With the close home-thrust of her pointed horns .</l>
       <l n="109">But Guy , swift wheeling round his snorting steed ,</l>
       <l n="110">Thought on his Phoelice , and , with mighty strength ,</l>
       <l n="111">Launch 'd forth a stroke that made the thick blood flow</l>
       <l n="112">In loathsome torrents from a gaping wound .</l>
       <l n="113">So , cheer 'd at heart , he thunder 'd blow on blow ,</l>
       <l n="114">Till , with a bellow of despair and pain ,</l>
       <l n="115">The monster tore the earth , and , writhing , died .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="116">And when Guy saw that he had slain the Beast ,</l>
       <l n="117">He was right glad , and full of sweet content .</l>
       <l n="118">And so he wiped his blood-stain 'd battle-axe ,</l>
       <l n="119">And rode with lighten 'd heart in haste away</l>
       <l n="120">To bear the welcome tidings to the town .</l>
       <l n="121">And as he pass 'd , or that he dreamt , or saw ,</l>
       <l n="122">It seem 'd as though the land bloom 'd up again ,</l>
       <l n="123">And sunshine fill 'd the air with hope and life .</l>
       <l n="124">And so he bore the tidings to the town —</l>
       <l n="125">And when the people heard the Beast was dead ,</l>
       <l n="126">They gather 'd round with tears and cries of joy ,</l>
       <l n="127">And scarce found words to thank and honour him .</l>
       <l n="128">And one brought forth her babe , and held him up ,</l>
       <l n="129">And cried , “ Look , child upon him , that your soul</l>
       <l n="130">May know the fashion of a noble man ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="131">But still he told no man that he was Guy .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="132">And all desired to lead him to the King ,</l>
       <l n="133">But he would not , and turn 'd another way —</l>
       <l n="134">“ Nay ! friends , ” said he , “ I need no recompense .</l>
       <l n="135">For in the doing of a worthy deed</l>
       <l n="136">Lies all the honour that a man should seek . ”</l>
       <l n="137">And thus he turn 'd away unto the sea ,</l>
       <l n="138">And would not tarry , or for prayers , or tears ;</l>
       <l n="139">And when he came unto the quiet port ,</l>
       <l n="140">He said no word unto his waiting men ,</l>
       <l n="141">But gazed out seaward ; and the waves were down ,</l>
       <l n="142">The clouds fast breaking , and the West wind blew ;</l>
       <l n="143">And many a sail sped swiftly o'er the main ,</l>
       <l n="144">White in the sunshine as a sea-gull 's wing —</l>
       <l n="145">And so he went on ship-board cheerily ,</l>
       <l n="146">And they hove anchor with a right good-will ,</l>
       <l n="147">And spreading canvas to the welcome breeze ,</l>
       <l n="148">Bore swiftly out into the open sea ;</l>
       <l n="149">And Guy stood silent in the dipping bows ,</l>

       <l n="109">I cried , heart-stricken , on Proserpina ;</l>
       <l n="110">I rent the rocks around with endless prayers ;</l>
       <l n="111">I told her all the story of our love ,</l>
       <l n="112">I launch 'd my sorrows on her woman 's heart ;</l>
       <l n="113">I sought her through the barren winter-time ,</l>
       <l n="114">The woful winter-time for Earth and me ;</l>
       <l n="115">And , “ Oh ! ” I thought , “ her soul will soon relent ,</l>
       <l n="116">And rush in crystal torrents from her eyes ,</l>
       <l n="117">Till in the joy of sympathetic tears ,</l>
       <l n="118">She woo my love from Pluto 's stony heart . ”</l>
       <l n="119">I waited , and I question 'd long the Spring ;</l>
       <l n="120">I question 'd every flower and budding spray ,</l>
       <l n="121">If thou didst come among them back again ;</l>
       <l n="122">I conjured each bright blossom , each green leaf ,</l>
       <l n="123">That , leaving Earth , she bears full-arm 'd to Dis ,</l>
       <l n="124">But backward flingeth ere her glad return ,</l>
       <l n="125">That every step of glorious liberty ,</l>
       <l n="126">Fall upon flowers throughout the happy land ;</l>
       <l n="127">But never came response , Eurydice ,—</l>
       <l n="128">The flowers were dumb , O lost Eurydice !</l>
       <l n="129">They would not see thee spring from Earth like them ,</l>
       <l n="130">Outshining all their fainter loveliness ,</l>
       <l n="131">And so they left me to my lorn despair ;</l>
       <l n="132">She left me lorn , O false Proserpina !</l>
       <l n="133">And never more may I behold thee here ,</l>
       <l n="134">In Spring or Summer , O Eurydice !</l>
       <l n="135">By day or night , O lost Eurydice !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="136">They shall not keep me from thee , O beloved !</l>
       <l n="137">Dis shall not keep me from thee , O beloved ;</l>
       <l n="138">But I shall shake his gates in my despair ,</l>
       <l n="139">Until they open wide to let me pass ;</l>
       <l n="140">I 'll take my life up like a mighty rock ,</l>
       <l n="141">And so beat breaches in the walls of Time ;</l>
       <l n="142">I 'll cast existence from me like a wrestler 's robes ,</l>
       <l n="143">And with my supple , naked soul throw Fate ;</l>
       <l n="144">I 'll snap the shackles whose Promethean links</l>
       <l n="145">Bind down my soul unto this narrow earth .—</l>
       <l n="146">Dost hear my voice dim floating to thee now ,</l>
       <l n="147">Along the waves that ripple at my feet ?</l>
       <l n="148">Thus do I come to thee , Eurydice ,</l>
       <l n="149">Through waving water-floods , Eurydice ,</l>
       <l n="150">I come , I come , beloved Eurydice !</l>

      <head>THE SCULPTOR .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The dream fell on him one calm summer night ,</l>
       <l n="2">Stealing amid the waving of the corn ,</l>
       <l n="3">That waited , golden , for the harvest morn —</l>
       <l n="4">The dream fell on him through the still moonlight .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">The land lay silent , and the new mown hay</l>
       <l n="6">Rested upon it like a dreamy sleep ;</l>
       <l n="7">And stealing softly o'er each yellow heap ,</l>
       <l n="8">The night-breeze bore sweet incense-breath away .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">The dew lay thick upon the unstirr 'd leaves ;</l>
       <l n="10">The glow-worm glisten 'd brightly as he pass 'd ;</l>
       <l n="11">The thrush still chaunted , but the swallows fast</l>
       <l n="12">Hied to their home beneath lone cottage eaves .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">He had been straying through the land that day ,</l>
       <l n="14">Dreaming of beauty as some dream of love ;</l>
       <l n="15">And all the earth beneath , the heaven above ,</l>
       <l n="16">In mirror 'd glory on his spirit lay .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">And , as he went , from every sight and sound ,</l>
       <l n="18">From silence , from the sweetness in the air ,</l>
       <l n="19">From earth , from heaven , from nature everywhere ,</l>
       <l n="20">Gleam 'd forth a deep dim thought and clasp 'd him round .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="21">The thought oppress 'd him with a weary joy ,</l>
       <l n="22">Seeking for ever for its perfect shape ,</l>
       <l n="23">That from his eager eyes would still escape ,</l>
       <l n="24">Flatter him onward — then his hopes destroy .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="25">He sought it in the bosom of the hills ;</l>
       <l n="26">He sought it in the silence of the woods ,</l>
       <l n="27">Their sunny nooks and shady solitudes ;</l>
       <l n="28">He sought it in the fountains and the rills .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="29">He watch 'd the stars come faintly through the skies ;</l>
       <l n="30">And on his upturn 'd brow the clear moon shone ,</l>
       <l n="31">Flooding his heart like pale Endymion ;</l>
       <l n="32">But still the thought hid dimly from his eyes ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="33">Its voice came to him on the evening breeze ,</l>
       <l n="34">That flutter 'd faintly through his summer dreams —</l>
       <l n="35">He heard it through the flowing of the streams ;</l>
       <l n="36">He heard it softly rustling through the trees .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="37">Yet still the thought that murmur 'd through his heart ,</l>
       <l n="38">He found not anywhere about the land ;</l>
       <l n="39">Ne'er saw its spirit shape before him stand ,</l>
       <l n="40">Though from all nature it seem 'd prone to start .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="41">And thus he wander 'd homeward , dreaming still</l>
       <l n="42">Of all the beauty that had haunted him ,</l>
       <l n="43">With mystic meanings shadowy and dim ,</l>
       <l n="44">By woodland , and by meadow , vale and hill :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="45">He wander 'd homeward , and in musing mood</l>
       <l n="46">Stay 'd his slow steps beside a marble block ,</l>
       <l n="47">Hewn from some far unstain 'd Italian rock ,</l>
       <l n="48">That for his shaping chisel waiting stood .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="49">Then his heart spoke out to him , “ Not alone</l>
       <l n="50">This thought divine hides in the streams and woods ,</l>
       <l n="51">Seeking expression through their solitudes ,</l>
       <l n="52">Perchance e'en lies it in this unhewn stone .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="53">It may be that the soul which fills all space ,</l>
       <l n="54">And speaks up to us from each thing we see ,</l>
       <l n="55">In words that are for ever mystery ,</l>
       <l n="56">Within this Parian , too , hath resting-place . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="57">He gazed on , dreaming through the dim twilight ,</l>
       <l n="58">And to his inner sight the marble grew</l>
       <l n="59">Clear and translucent , so that , gazing through ,</l>
       <l n="60">A mystic shape form 'd to his wondering sight ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="61">That seem 'd imprison 'd in the Parian cell ,</l>
       <l n="62">Seeking in vain release and utterance ;</l>
       <l n="63">For evermore , with upward beaming glance ,</l>
       <l n="64">Framing the words its lips could never tell .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="17">
       <l n="65">The vision pass 'd ; but still with unseen power ,</l>
       <l n="66">It stirr 'd within his heart by night and day ;</l>
       <l n="67">And swift to hew the prison walls away ,</l>
       <l n="68">The Sculptor toil 'd , love-strengthen 'd , from that hour .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="18">
       <l n="69">He wrought with patience , and at length , amazed ,</l>
       <l n="70">Beheld the mystic form all perfect stand ,</l>
       <l n="71">Released in beauty by his artist hand ,</l>
       <l n="72">He scarce knew how , and wonder 'd as he gazed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="19">
       <l n="73">It was a lovely form whose lifted arms</l>
       <l n="74">Yearn 'd towards heaven with all its radiant frame ,</l>
       <l n="75">As though the soul within on wings of flame</l>
       <l n="76">Up from the earth would waft its angel charms ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="20">
       <l n="77">But still one touch retain 'd it to the ground ;</l>
       <l n="78">So that the love that beam 'd up from its eyes</l>
       <l n="79">Flow 'd evermore towards the distant skies ,</l>
       <l n="80">And yet to earth the shape remain 'd spell-bound .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="21">
       <l n="81">The dream fell on him one calm summer night ;</l>
       <l n="82">And thus in that fair form still heavenward turning</l>
       <l n="83">Eternal aspiration , endless yearning ,</l>
       <l n="84">Stood now the Thought before his gladden 'd sight .</l>
