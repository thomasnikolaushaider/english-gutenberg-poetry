      <head>PRELUDE .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Pleasant it was , when woods were green ,</l>
       <l n="2">And winds were soft and low ,</l>
       <l n="3">To lie amid some sylvan scene .</l>
       <l n="4">Where , the long drooping boughs between ,</l>
       <l n="5">Shadows dark and sunlight sheen</l>
       <l n="6">Alternate come and go ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">Or where the denser grove receives</l>
       <l n="8">No sunlight from above ,</l>
       <l n="9">But the dark foliage interweaves</l>
       <l n="10">In one unbroken roof of leaves ,</l>
       <l n="11">Underneath whose sloping eaves</l>
       <l n="12">The shadows hardly move .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="13">Beneath some patriarchal tree</l>
       <l n="14">I lay upon the ground ;</l>
       <l n="15">His hoary arms uplifted he ,</l>
       <l n="16">And all the broad leaves over me</l>
       <l n="17">Clapped their little hands in glee ,</l>
       <l n="18">With one continuous sound ;—</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="19">A slumberous sound , a sound that brings</l>
       <l n="20">The feelings of a dream ,</l>
       <l n="21">As of innumerable wings ,</l>
       <l n="22">As , when a bell no longer swings ,</l>
       <l n="23">Faint the hollow murmur rings</l>
       <l n="24">O'er meadow , lake , and stream .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="25">And dreams of that which cannot die ,</l>
       <l n="26">Bright visions , came to me ,</l>
       <l n="27">As lapped in thought I used to lie ,</l>
       <l n="28">And gaze into the summer sky ,</l>
       <l n="29">Where the sailing clouds went by ,</l>
       <l n="30">Like ships upon the sea ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="31">Dreams that the soul of youth engage</l>
       <l n="32">Ere Fancy has been quelled ;</l>
       <l n="33">Old legends of the monkish page ,</l>
       <l n="34">Traditions of the saint and sage ,</l>
       <l n="35">Tales that have the rime of age ,</l>
       <l n="36">And chronicles of Eld .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="37">And , loving still these quaint old themes ,</l>
       <l n="38">Even in the city 's throng</l>
       <l n="39">I feel the freshness of the streams ,</l>
       <l n="40">That , crossed by shades and sunny gleams ,</l>
       <l n="41">Water the green land of dreams ,</l>
       <l n="42">The holy land of song .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="43">Therefore , at Pentecost , which brings</l>
       <l n="44">The Spring , clothed like a bride ,</l>
       <l n="45">When nestling buds unfold their wings ,</l>
       <l n="46">And bishop'shYpppHeNcaps have golden rings ,</l>
       <l n="47">Musing upon many things ,</l>
       <l n="48">I sought the woodlands wide .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="49">The green trees whispered low and mild ;</l>
       <l n="50">It was a sound of joy !</l>
       <l n="51">They were my playmates when a child ,</l>
       <l n="52">And rocked me in their arms so wild !</l>
       <l n="53">Still they looked at me and smiled ,</l>
       <l n="54">As if I were a boy ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="55">And ever whispered , mild and low ,</l>
       <l n="56">“ Come , be a child once more ! ”</l>
       <l n="57">And waved their long arms to and fro ,</l>
       <l n="58">And beckoned solemnly and slow ;</l>
       <l n="59">O , I could not choose but go</l>
       <l n="60">Into the woodlands hoar ,—</l>

      <head>THE SPIRIT OF POETRY</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">There is a quiet spirit in these woods ,</l>
       <l n="2">That dwells where'er the gentle south-wind blows ;</l>
       <l n="3">Where , underneath the white-thorn , in the glade ,</l>
       <l n="4">The wild flowers bloom , or , kissing the soft air ,</l>
       <l n="5">The leaves above their sunny palms outspread .</l>
       <l n="6">With what a tender and impassioned voice</l>
       <l n="7">It fills the nice and delicate ear of thought ,</l>
       <l n="8">When the fast ushering star of morning comes</l>
       <l n="9">O'erhYpppHeNriding the gray hills with golden scarf ;</l>
       <l n="10">Or when the cowled and dusky-sandaled Eve ,</l>
       <l n="11">In mourning weeds , from out the western gate ,</l>
       <l n="12">Departs with silent pace ! That spirit moves</l>
       <l n="13">In the green valley , where the silver brook ,</l>
       <l n="14">From its full laver , pours the white cascade ;</l>
       <l n="15">And , babbling low amid the tangled woods ,</l>
       <l n="16">Slips down through moss-grown stones with endless laughter .</l>
       <l n="17">And frequent , on the everlasting hills ,</l>
       <l n="18">Its feet go forth , when it doth wrap itself</l>
       <l n="19">In all the dark embroidery of the storm ,</l>
       <l n="20">And shouts the stern , strong wind . And here , amid</l>
       <l n="21">The silent majesty of these deep woods ,</l>
       <l n="22">Its presence shall uplift thy thoughts from earth ,</l>
       <l n="23">As to the sunshine and the pure , bright air</l>
       <l n="24">Their tops the green trees lift . Hence gifted bards</l>
       <l n="25">Have ever loved the calm and quiet shades .</l>
       <l n="26">For them there was an eloquent voice in all</l>
       <l n="27">The sylvan pomp of woods , the golden sun ,</l>
       <l n="28">The flowers , the leaves , the river on its way ,</l>
       <l n="29">Blue skies , and silver clouds , and gentle winds ,</l>

       <l n="31">Aslant the wooded slope , at evening , goes ,</l>
       <l n="32">Groves , through whose broken roof the sky looks in ,</l>
       <l n="33">Mountain , and shattered cliff , and sunny vale ,</l>
       <l n="34">The distant lake , fountains , and mighty trees ,</l>
       <l n="35">In many a lazy syllable , repeating</l>

       <l n="39">My busy fancy oft embodies it ,</l>
       <l n="40">As a bright image of the light and beauty</l>
       <l n="41">That dwell in nature ; of the heavenly forms</l>
       <l n="42">We worship in our dreams , and the soft hues</l>

       <l n="44">When the sun sets . Within her tender eye</l>
       <l n="45">The heaven of April , with its changing light ,</l>
       <l n="46">And when it wears the blue of May , is hung ,</l>
       <l n="47">And on her lip the rich , red rose . Her hair</l>
       <l n="48">Is like the summer tresses of the trees ,</l>
       <l n="49">When twilight makes them brown , and on her cheek</l>
       <l n="50">Blushes the richness of an autumn sky ,</l>
       <l n="51">With ever-shifting beauty . Then her breath ,</l>
       <l n="52">It is so like the gentle air of Spring ,</l>
       <l n="53">As , front the morning 's dewy flowers , it comes</l>
       <l n="54">Full of their fragrance , that it is a joy</l>
       <l n="55">To have it round us , and her silver voice</l>
       <l n="56">Is the rich music of a summer bird ,</l>
       <l n="57">Heard in the still night , with its passionate cadence .</l>

     <head>POEMS ON SLAVERY .</head>
     <note>The following poems , with one exception , were written at sea , in the latter part of October , 1842 . I had not then heard of Dr. Channing 's death . Since that event , the poem addressed to him is no longer appropriate . I have decided , however , to let it remain as it was written , in testimony of my admiration for a great and good man .</note>

     <p>Chispa . Abernuncio Satanas ! and a plague on all lovers who ramble about at night , drinking the elements , instead of sleeping quietly in their beds . Every dead man to his cemetery , say I ; and every friar to his monastery . Now , here 's my master , Victorian , yesterday a cow-keeper , and to-day a gentleman ; yesterday a student , and to-day a lover ; and I must be up later than the nightingale , for as the abbot sings so must the sacristan respond . God grant he may soon be married , for then shall all this serenading cease . Ay , marry ! marry ! marry ! Mother , what does marry mean ? It means to spin , to bear children , and to weep , my daughter ! And , of a truth , there is something more in matrimony than the wedding-ring . ( To the musicians . ) And now , gentlemen , Pax vobiscum ! as the ass said to the cabbages . Pray , walk this way ; and do n't hang down your heads . It is no disgrace to have an old father and a ragged shirt . Now , look you , you are gentlemen who lead the life of crickets ; you enjoy hunger by day and noise by night . Yet , I beseech you , for this once be not loud , but pathetic ; for it is a serenade to a damsel in bed , and not to the Man in the Moon . Your object is not to arouse and terrify , but to soothe and bring lulling dreams . Therefore , each shall not play upon his instrument as if it were the only one in the universe , but gently , and with a certain modesty , according with the others . Pray , how may I call thy name , friend ?</p>

     <p>First Mus . An Aragonese bagpipe .</p>
     <p>Chispa . Pray , art thou related to the bagpiper of Bujalance , who asked a maravedi for playing , and ten for leaving off ?</p>
     <p>First Mus . No , your honor .</p>
     <p>Chispa . I am glad of it . What other instruments have we ?</p>

     <p>Chispa . A pleasing instrument . And thou ?</p>

     <p>Other Mus . We are the singers , please your honor .</p>
     <p>Chispa . You are too many . Do you think we are going to sing mass in the cathedral of Cordova ? Four men can make but little use of one shoe , and I see not how you can all sing in one song . But follow me along the garden wall . That is the way my master climbs to the lady 's window , it is by the Vicar 's skirts that the Devil climbs into the belfry . Come , follow me , and make no noise . [ Exeunt .</p>

     <p>Chispa . No ; you might as well say , “ Don'thYpppHeNyouhYpppHeNwanthYpppHeNsome ? ” to a dead man .</p>
     <p>Bal . Why does he go so often to Madrid ?</p>
     <p>Chispa . For the same reason that he eats no supper . He is in love . Were you ever in love , Baltasar ?</p>
     <p>Bal . I was never out of it , good Chispa . It has been the torment of my life .</p>

       <lg type="stanza" n="4">
        <l n="20">In the Acadian land , on the shores of the Basin of Minas ,</l>
        <l n="21">Distant , secluded , still , the little village of Grand-Pre</l>
        <l n="22">Lay in the fruitful valley . Vast meadows stretched to the eastward ,</l>
        <l n="23">Giving the village its name , and pasture to flocks without number .</l>
        <l n="24">Dikes , that the hands of the farmers had raised with labor incessant ,</l>
        <l n="25">Shut out the turbulent tides ; but at stated seasons the flood-gates</l>
        <l n="26">Opened , and welcomed the sea to wander at will o'er the meadows .</l>
        <l n="27">West and south there were fields of flax , and orchards and cornfields</l>
        <l n="28">Spreading afar and unfenced o'er the plain ; and away to the northward</l>
        <l n="29">Blomidon rose , and the forests old , and aloft on the mountains</l>
        <l n="30">Sea-fogs pitched their tents , and mists from the mighty Atlantic</l>
        <l n="31">Looked on the happy valley , but ne'er from their station descended</l>
        <l n="32">There , in the midst of its farms , reposed the Acadian village .</l>
        <l n="33">Strongly built were the houses , with frames of oak and of hemlock ,</l>
        <l n="34">Such as the peasants of Normandy built in the reign of the Henries .</l>
        <l n="35">Thatched were the roofs , with dormer-windows ; and gables projecting</l>
        <l n="36">Over the basement below protected and shaded the doorway .</l>
        <l n="37">There in the tranquil evenings of summer , when brightly the sunset</l>
        <l n="38">Lighted the village street and gilded the vanes on the chimneys ,</l>
        <l n="39">Matrons and maidens sat in snow-white caps and in kirtles</l>
        <l n="40">Scarlet and blue and green , with distaffs spinning the golden</l>
        <l n="41">Flax for the gossiping looms , whose noisy shuttles within doors</l>
        <l n="42">Mingled their sound with the whir of the wheels and the songs of the maidens ,</l>
        <l n="43">Solemnly down the street came the parish priest , and the children</l>
        <l n="44">Paused in their play to kiss the hand he extended to bless them .</l>
        <l n="45">Reverend walked he among them ; and up rose matrons and maidens ,</l>
        <l n="46">Hailing his slow approach with words of affectionate welcome .</l>
        <l n="47">Then came the laborers home from the field , and serenely the sun sank</l>
        <l n="48">Down to his rest , and twilight prevailed . Anon from the belfry</l>
        <l n="49">Softly the Angelus sounded , and over the roofs of the village</l>
        <l n="50">Columns of pale blue smoke , like clouds of incense ascending ,</l>
        <l n="51">Rose from a hundred hearths , the homes of peace and contentment .</l>
        <l n="52">Thus dwelt together in love these simple Acadian farmers ,—</l>
        <l n="53">Dwelt in the love of God and of man . Alike were they free from</l>
        <l n="54">Fear , that reigns with the tyrant , and envy , the vice of republics .</l>
        <l n="55">Neither locks had they to their doors , nor bars to their windows ;</l>
        <l n="56">But their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of their owners ;</l>
        <l n="57">There the richest was poor , and the poorest lived in abundance .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="5">
        <l n="58">Somewhat apart from the village , and nearer the Basin of Minas ,</l>
        <l n="59">Benedict Bellefontaine , the wealthiest farmer of Grand-Pre ,</l>
        <l n="60">Dwelt on his goodly acres : and with him , directing his household ,</l>
        <l n="61">Gentle Evangeline lived , his child , and the pride of the village .</l>
        <l n="62">Stalworth and stately in form was the man of seventy winters ;</l>
        <l n="63">Hearty and hale was he , an oak that is covered with snow-flakes ;</l>
        <l n="64">White as the snow were his locks , and his cheeks as brown as the oak-leaves .</l>
        <l n="65">Fair was she to behold , that maiden of seventeen summers .</l>
        <l n="66">Black were her eyes as the berry that grows on the thorn by the wayside ,</l>
        <l n="67">Black , yet how softly they gleamed beneath the brown shade of her tresses !</l>
        <l n="68">Sweet was her breath as the breath of kine that feed in the meadows .</l>
        <l n="69">When in the harvest heat she bore to the reapers at noontide</l>
        <l n="70">Flagons of home-brewed ale , ah ! fair in sooth was the maiden ,</l>
        <l n="71">Fairer was she when , on Sunday morn , while the bell from its turret</l>
        <l n="72">Sprinkled with holy sounds the air , as the priest with his hyssop</l>
        <l n="73">Sprinkles the congregation , and scatters blessings upon them ,</l>
        <l n="74">Down the long street she passed , with her chaplet of beads and her missal ,</l>
        <l n="75">Wearing her Norman cap and her kirtle of blue , and the ear-rings ,</l>
        <l n="76">Brought in the olden time from France , and since , as an heirloom ,</l>
        <l n="77">Handed down from mother to child , through long generations .</l>
        <l n="78">But a celestial brightness — a more ethereal beauty —</l>
        <l n="79">Shone on her face and encircled her form , when , after confession ,</l>
        <l n="80">Homeward serenely she walked with God 's benediction upon her .</l>
        <l n="81">When she had passed , it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="6">
        <l n="82">Firmly builded with rafters of oak , the house of the farmer</l>
        <l n="83">Stood on the side of a hill commanding the sea ; and a shady</l>
        <l n="84">Sycamore grew by the door , with a woodbine wreathing around it .</l>
        <l n="85">Rudely carved was the porch , with seats beneath ; and a footpath</l>
        <l n="86">Led through an orchard wide , and disappeared in the meadow .</l>
        <l n="87">Under the sycamore-tree were hives overhung by a penthouse ,</l>
        <l n="88">Such as the traveller sees in regions remote by the roadside ,</l>
        <l n="89">Built o'er a box for the poor , or the blessed image of Mary .</l>
        <l n="90">Farther down , on the slope of the hill , was the well with its moss-grown</l>
        <l n="91">Bucket , fastened with iron , and near it a trough for the horses .</l>
        <l n="92">Shielding the house from storms , on the north , were the barns and the farm-yard ,</l>
        <l n="93">There stood the broad-wheeled wains and the antique ploughs and the harrows ;</l>
        <l n="94">There were the folds for the sheep ; and there , in his feathered seraglio ,</l>
        <l n="95">Strutted the lordly turkey , and crowed the cock , with the selfsame</l>
        <l n="96">Voice that in ages of old had startled the penitent Peter .</l>
        <l n="97">Bursting with hay were the barns , themselves a village . In each one</l>
        <l n="98">Far o'er the gable projected a roof of thatch ; and a staircase ,</l>
        <l n="99">Under the sheltering eaves , led up to the odorous corn-loft .</l>
        <l n="100">There too the dove-cot stood , with its meek and innocent inmates</l>
        <l n="101">Murmuring ever of love ; while above in the variant breezes</l>
        <l n="102">Numberless noisy weathercocks rattled and sang of mutation .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="7">
        <l n="103">Thus , at peace with God and the world , the farmer of Grand-Pre</l>
        <l n="104">Lived on his sunny farm , and Evangeline governed his household .</l>
        <l n="105">Many a youth , as he knelt in the church and opened his missal ,</l>
        <l n="106">Fixed his eyes upon her as the saint of his deepest devotion ;</l>
        <l n="107">Happy was he who might touch her hand or the hem of her garment !</l>
        <l n="108">Many a suitor came to her door , by the darkness befriended ,</l>
        <l n="109">And , as he knocked and waited to hear the sound of her footsteps ,</l>
        <l n="110">Knew not which beat the louder , his heart or the knocker of iron ;</l>
        <l n="111">Or at the joyous feast of the Patron Saint of the village ,</l>
        <l n="112">Bolder grew , and pressed her hand in the dance as he whispered</l>
        <l n="113">Hurried words of love , that seemed a part of the music .</l>
        <l n="114">But , among all who came , young Gabriel only was welcome ;</l>
        <l n="115">Gabriel Lajeunesse , the son of Basil the blacksmith ,</l>
        <l n="116">Who was a mighty man in the village , and honored of all men ;</l>
        <l n="117">For , since the birth of time , throughout all ages and nations ,</l>
        <l n="118">Has the craft of the smith been held in repute by the people .</l>
        <l n="119">Basil was Benedict 's friend . Their children from earliest childhood</l>
        <l n="120">Grew up together as brother and sister ; and Father Felician ,</l>
        <l n="121">Priest and pedagogue both in the village , had taught them their letters</l>
        <l n="122">Out of the selfsame book , with the hymns of the church and the plain-song .</l>
        <l n="123">But when the hymn was sung , and the daily lesson completed ,</l>
        <l n="124">Swiftly they hurried away to the forge of Basil the blacksmith .</l>
        <l n="125">There at the door they stood , with wondering eyes to behold him</l>
        <l n="126">Take in his leathern lap the hoof of the horse as a plaything ,</l>
        <l n="127">Nailing the shoe in its place ; while near him the tire of the cart-wheel</l>
        <l n="128">Lay like a fiery snake , coiled round in a circle of cinders .</l>
        <l n="129">Oft on autumnal eves , when without in the gathering darkness</l>
        <l n="130">Bursting with light seemed the smithy , through every cranny and crevice ,</l>
        <l n="131">Warm by the forge within they watched the laboring bellows ,</l>
        <l n="132">And as its panting ceased , and the sparks expired in the ashes ,</l>
        <l n="133">Merrily laughed , and said they were nuns going into the chapel .</l>
        <l n="134">Oft on sledges in winter , as swift as the swoop of the eagle ,</l>
        <l n="135">Down the hillside hounding , they glided away o'er the meadow .</l>
        <l n="136">Oft in the barns they climbed to the populous nests on the rafters ,</l>
        <l n="137">Seeking with eager eyes that wondrous stone , which the swallow</l>
        <l n="138">Brings from the shore of the sea to restore the sight of its fledglings ;</l>
        <l n="139">Lucky was he who found that stone in the nest of the swallow !</l>
        <l n="140">Thus passed a few swift years , and they no longer were children .</l>
        <l n="141">He was a valiant youth , and his face , like the face of the morning ,</l>
        <l n="142">Gladdened the earth with its light , and ripened thought into action .</l>
        <l n="143">She was a woman now , with the heart and hopes of a woman .</l>
        <l n="144">“ Sunshine of Saint Eulalie ” was she called ; for that was the sunshine</l>
        <l n="145">Which , as the farmers believed , would load their orchards with apples</l>
        <l n="146">She , too , would bring to her husband 's house delight and abundance ,</l>
        <l n="147">Filling it full of love and the ruddy faces of children .</l>

        <l n="148">Now had the season returned , when the nights grow colder and longer ,</l>
        <l n="149">And the retreating sun the sign of the Scorpion enters .</l>
        <l n="150">Birds of passage sailed through the leaden air , from the ice-bound ,</l>
        <l n="151">Desolate northern bays to the shores of tropical islands ,</l>
        <l n="152">Harvests were gathered in ; and wild with the winds of September</l>
        <l n="153">Wrestled the trees of the forest , as Jacob of old with the angel .</l>
        <l n="154">All the signs foretold a winter long and inclement .</l>
        <l n="155">Bees , with prophetic instinct of want , had hoarded their honey</l>
        <l n="156">Till the hives overflowed ; and the Indian bunters asserted</l>
        <l n="157">Cold would the winter be , for thick was the fur of the foxes .</l>
        <l n="158">Such was the advent of autumn . Then followed that beautiful season ,</l>
        <l n="159">Called by the pious Acadian peasants the Summer of All-Saints !</l>
        <l n="160">Filled was the air with a dreamy and magical light ; and the landscape</l>
        <l n="161">Lay as if new-created in all the freshness of childhood .</l>
        <l n="162">Peace seemed to reign upon earth , and the restless heart of the ocean</l>
        <l n="163">Was for a moment consoled . All sounds were in harmony blended .</l>
        <l n="164">Voices of children at play , the crowing of cocks in the farm-yards ,</l>
        <l n="165">Whir of wings in the drowsy air , and the cooing of pigeons ,</l>
        <l n="166">All were subdued and low as the murmurs of love , and the great sun</l>
        <l n="167">Looked with the eye of love through the golden vapors around him ;</l>
        <l n="168">While arrayed in its robes of russet and scarlet and yellow ,</l>
        <l n="169">Bright with the sheen of the dew , each glittering tree of the forest</l>
        <l n="170">Flashed like the plane-tree the Persian adorned with mantles and</l>

       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="9">
        <l n="172">Now recommenced the reign of rest and affection and stillness .</l>
        <l n="173">Day with its burden and heat had departed , and twilight descending</l>
        <l n="174">Brought back the evening star to the sky , and the herds to the homestead .</l>
        <l n="175">Pawing the ground they came , and resting their necks on each other ,</l>
        <l n="176">And with their nostrils distended inhaling the freshness of evening .</l>
        <l n="177">Foremost , bearing the bell , Evangeline 's beautiful heifer ,</l>
        <l n="178">Proud of her snow-white hide , and the ribbon that waved from her collar ,</l>
        <l n="179">Quietly paced and slow , as if conscious of human affection .</l>
        <l n="180">Then came the shepherd back with his bleating flocks from the seaside ,</l>
        <l n="181">Where was their favorite pasture . Behind them followed the watch-dog ,</l>
        <l n="182">Patient , full of importance , and grand in the pride of his instinct ,</l>
        <l n="183">Walking from side to side with a lordly air , and superbly</l>
        <l n="184">Waving his bushy tail , and urging forward the stragglers ;</l>
        <l n="185">Regent of flocks was he when the shepherd slept ; their protector ,</l>
        <l n="186">When from the forest at night , through the starry silence , the wolves howled .</l>
        <l n="187">Late , with the rising moon , returned the wains from the marshes ,</l>
        <l n="188">Laden with briny hay , that filled the air with its odor .</l>
        <l n="189">Cheerily neighed the steeds , with dew on their manes and their fetlocks ,</l>
        <l n="190">While aloft on their shoulders the wooden and ponderous saddles ,</l>
        <l n="191">Painted with brilliant dyes , and adorned with tassels of crimson ,</l>
        <l n="192">Nodded in bright array , like hollyhocks heavy with blossoms .</l>
        <l n="193">Patiently stood the cows meanwhile , and yielded their udders</l>
        <l n="194">Unto the milkmaid 's hand ; whilst loud and in regular cadence</l>
        <l n="195">Into the sounding pails the foaming streamlets descended .</l>
        <l n="196">Lowing of cattle and peals of laughter were heard in the farm-yard ,</l>
        <l n="197">Echoed back by the barns . Anon they sank into stillness ;</l>
        <l n="198">Heavily closed , with a jarring sound , the valves of the barn-doors ,</l>
        <l n="199">Rattled the wooden bars , and all for a season was silent .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="10">
        <l n="200">In-doors , warm by the wide-mouthed fireplace , idly the farmer</l>
        <l n="201">Sat in his elbow-chair , and watched how the flames and the smoke-wreaths</l>
        <l n="202">Struggled together like foes in a burning city . Behind him ,</l>
        <l n="203">Nodding and mocking along the wall , with gestures fantastic ,</l>
        <l n="204">Darted his own huge shadow , and vanished away into darkness .</l>
        <l n="205">Faces , clumsily carved in oak , on the back of his arm-chair</l>
        <l n="206">Laughed in the flickering light , and the pewter plates on the dresser</l>
        <l n="207">Caught and reflected the flame , as shields of armies the sunshine .</l>
        <l n="208">Fragments of song the old man sang , and carols of Christmas ,</l>
        <l n="209">Such as at home , in the olden time , his fathers before him</l>
        <l n="210">Sang in their Norman orchards and bright Burgundian vineyards .</l>
        <l n="211">Close at her father 's side was the gentle Evangeline seated ,</l>
        <l n="212">Spinning flax for the loom , that stood in the corner behind her .</l>
        <l n="213">Silent awhile were its treadles , at rest was its diligent shuttle ,</l>
        <l n="214">While the monotonous drone of the wheel , like the drone of a bagpipe ,</l>
        <l n="215">Followed the old man 's songs and united the fragments together .</l>
        <l n="216">As in a church , when the chant of the choir at intervals ceases ,</l>
        <l n="217">Footfalls are heard in the aisles , or words of the priest at the altar ,</l>
        <l n="218">So , in each pause of the song , with measured motion the clock clicked .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="11">
        <l n="219">Thus as they sat , there were footsteps heard , and , suddenly lifted ,</l>
        <l n="220">Sounded the wooden latch , and the door swung back on its hinges .</l>
        <l n="221">Benedict knew by the hob-nailed shoes it was Basil the blacksmith ,</l>
        <l n="222">And by her beating heart Evangeline knew who was with him .</l>
        <l n="223">“ Welcome ! ” the farmer exclaimed , as their footsteps paused on the threshold .</l>
        <l n="224">“ Welcome , Basil , my friend ! Come , take thy place on the settle</l>
        <l n="225">Close by the chimney-side , which is always empty without thee ;</l>
        <l n="226">Take from the shelf overhead thy pipe and the box of tobacco ;</l>
        <l n="227">Never so much thyself art thou as when through the curling</l>
        <l n="228">Smoke of the pipe or the forge thy friendly and jovial face gleams</l>
        <l n="229">Round and red as the harvest moon through the mist of the marshes . ”</l>
        <l n="230">Then , with a smile of content , thus answered Basil the blacksmith ,</l>
        <l n="231">Taking with easy air the accustomed seat by the fireside :—</l>
        <l n="232">“ Benedict Bellefontaine , thou hast ever thy jest and thy ballad !</l>
        <l n="233">Ever in cheerfullest mood art thou , when others are filled with</l>
        <l n="234">Gloomy forebodings of ill , and see only ruin before them .</l>
        <l n="235">Happy art thou , as if every day thou hadst picked up a horseshoe . ”</l>
        <l n="236">Pausing a moment , to take the pipe that Evangeline brought him ,</l>
        <l n="237">And with a coal from the embers had lighted , he slowly continued :—</l>
        <l n="238">“ Four days now are passed since the English ships at their anchors</l>
        <l n="239">Ride in the Gaspereau 's mouth , with their cannon pointed against us .</l>
        <l n="240">What their design may be is unknown ; but all are commanded</l>
        <l n="241">On the morrow to meet in the church , where his Majesty 's mandate</l>
        <l n="242">Will be proclaimed as law in the land . Alas ! in the mean time</l>
        <l n="243">Many surmises of evil alarm the hearts of the people . ”</l>
        <l n="244">Then made answer the farmer :— “ Perhaps some friendlier purpose</l>
        <l n="245">Brings these ships to our shores . Perhaps the harvests in England</l>
        <l n="246">By untimely rains or untimelier heat have been blighted ,</l>
        <l n="247">And from our bursting barns they would feed their cattle and children . ”</l>
        <l n="248">“ Not so thinketh the folk in the village , ” said , warmly , the blacksmith ,</l>
        <l n="249">Shaking his head , as in doubt ; then , heaving a sigh , he continued :—</l>
        <l n="250">“ Louisburg is not forgotten , nor Beau Sejour , nor Port Royal .</l>
        <l n="251">Many already have fled to the forest , and lurk on its outskirts ,</l>
        <l n="252">Waiting with anxious hearts the dubious fate of to-morrow .</l>
        <l n="253">Arms have been taken from us , and warlike weapons of all kinds ;</l>
        <l n="254">Nothing is left but the blacksmith 's sledge and the scythe of the mower . ”</l>
        <l n="255">Then with a pleasant smile made answer the jovial farmer :—</l>
        <l n="256">“ Safer are we unarmed , in the midst of our flocks and our cornfields ,</l>
        <l n="257">Safer within these peaceful dikes , besieged by the ocean ,</l>
        <l n="258">Than our fathers in forts , besieged by the enemy 's cannon .</l>
        <l n="259">Fear no evil , my friend , and to-night may no shadow of sorrow</l>
        <l n="260">Fall on this house and hearth ; for this is the night of the contract .</l>
        <l n="261">Built are the house and the barn . The merry lads of the village</l>
        <l n="262">Strongly have built them and well ; and , breaking the glebe round about them ,</l>
        <l n="263">Filled the barn with hay , and the house with food for a twelvemonth .</l>
        <l n="264">Rene Leblanc will be here anon , with his papers and inkhorn .</l>
        <l n="265">Shall we not then be glad , and rejoice in the joy of our children ? ”</l>
        <l n="266">As apart by the window she stood , with her hand in her lover 's ,</l>
        <l n="267">Blushing Evangeline heard the words that her father had spoken ,</l>
        <l n="268">And , as they died on his lips , the worthy notary entered .</l>

        <l n="269">Bent like a laboring oar , that toils in the surf of the ocean ,</l>
        <l n="270">Bent , but not broken , by age was the form of the notary public ;</l>
        <l n="271">Shocks of yellow hair , like the silken floss of the maize , hung</l>
        <l n="272">Over his shoulders ; his forehead was high ; and glasses with horn bows</l>
        <l n="273">Sat astride on his nose , with a look of wisdom supernal .</l>
        <l n="274">Father of twenty children was he , and more than a hundred</l>
        <l n="275">Children 's children rode on his knee , and heard his great watch tick .</l>
        <l n="276">Four long years in the times of the war had he languished a captive ,</l>
        <l n="277">Suffering much in an old French fort as the friend of the English .</l>
        <l n="278">Now , though warier grown , without all guile or suspicion ,</l>
        <l n="279">Ripe in wisdom was he , but patient , and simple , and childlike .</l>
        <l n="280">He was beloved by all , and most of all by the children ;</l>
        <l n="281">For he told them tales of the Loup-garou in the forest ,</l>
        <l n="282">And of the goblin that came in the night to water the horses ,</l>
        <l n="283">And of the white Letiche , the ghost of a child who unchristened</l>
        <l n="284">Died , and was doomed to haunt unseen the chambers of children ;</l>
        <l n="285">And how on Christmas eve the oxen talked in the stable ,</l>
        <l n="286">And how the fever was cured by a spider shut up in a nutshell ,</l>
        <l n="287">And of the marvellous powers of four-leaved clover and horseshoes ,</l>
        <l n="288">With whatsoever else was writ in the lore of the village .</l>
        <l n="289">Then up rose from his seat by the fireside Basil the blacksmith ,</l>
        <l n="290">Knocked from his pipe the ashes , and slowly extending his right hand ,</l>
        <l n="291">“ Father Leblanc , ” he exclaimed , “ thou hast heard the talk in the village ,</l>
        <l n="292">And , perchance , canst tell us some news of these ships and their errand . ”</l>
        <l n="293">Then with modest demeanor made answer the notary public ,—</l>
        <l n="294">“ Gossip enough have I heard , in sooth , yet am never the wiser ;</l>
        <l n="295">And what their errand may be I know not better than others .</l>
        <l n="296">Yet am I not of those who imagine some evil intention</l>
        <l n="297">Brings them here , for we are at peace ; and why then molest us ? ”</l>
        <l n="298">“ God 's name ! ” shouted the hasty and somewhat irascible blacksmith ;</l>
        <l n="299">“ Must we in all things look for the how , and the why , and the wherefore ?</l>
        <l n="300">Daily injustice is done , and might is the right of the strongest ! ”</l>
        <l n="301">But , without heeding his warmth , continued the notary public ,—</l>
        <l n="302">“ Man is unjust , but God is just ; and finally justice</l>
        <l n="303">Triumphs ; and well I remember a story , that often consoled me ,</l>
        <l n="304">When as a captive I lay in the old French fort at Port Royal . ”</l>
        <l n="305">This was the old man 's favorite tale , and he loved to repeat it</l>
        <l n="306">When his neighbors complained that any injustice was done them .</l>
        <l n="307">“ Once in an ancient city , whose name I no longer remember ,</l>
        <l n="308">Raised aloft on a column , a brazen statue of Justice</l>
        <l n="309">Stood in the public square , upholding the scales in its left hand ,</l>
        <l n="310">And in its right a sword , as an emblem that justice presided</l>
        <l n="311">Over the laws of the land , and the hearts and homes of the people .</l>
        <l n="312">Even the birds had built their nests in the scales of the balance ,</l>
        <l n="313">Having no fear of the sword that flashed in the sunshine above them .</l>
        <l n="314">But in the course of time the laws of the land were corrupted ;</l>
        <l n="315">Might took the place of right , and the weak were oppressed , and the mighty</l>
        <l n="316">Ruled with an iron rod . Then it chanced in a nobleman 's palace</l>
        <l n="317">That a necklace of pearls was lost , and erelong a suspicion</l>
        <l n="318">Fell on an orphan girl who lived as maid in the household .</l>
        <l n="319">She , after form of trial condemned to die on the scaffold ,</l>
        <l n="320">Patiently met her doom at the foot of the statue of Justice .</l>
        <l n="321">As to her Father in heaven her innocent spirit ascended ,</l>
        <l n="322">Lo ! o'er the city a tempest rose ; and the bolts of the thunder</l>
        <l n="323">Smote the statue of bronze , and hurled in wrath from its left hand</l>
        <l n="324">Down on the pavement below the clattering scales of the balance ,</l>
        <l n="325">And in the hollow thereof was found the nest of a magpie ,</l>
        <l n="326">Into whose clay-built walls the necklace of pearls was inwoven . ”</l>
        <l n="327">Silenced , but not convinced , when the story was ended , the blacksmith</l>
        <l n="328">Stood like a man who fain would speak , but findeth no language ;</l>
        <l n="329">All his thoughts were congealed into lines on his face , as the vapors</l>
        <l n="330">Freeze in fantastic shapes on the window-panes in the winter .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="13">
        <l n="331">Then Evangeline lighted the brazen lamp on the table ,</l>
        <l n="332">Filled , till it overflowed , the pewter tankard with home-brewed</l>
        <l n="333">Nut-brown ale , that was famed for its strength in the village of Grand-Pre ;</l>
        <l n="334">While from his pocket the notary drew his papers and inkhorn ,</l>
        <l n="335">Wrote with a steady hand the date and the age of the parties ,</l>
        <l n="336">Naming the dower of the bride in flocks of sheep and in cattle .</l>
        <l n="337">Orderly all things proceeded , and duly and well were completed ,</l>
        <l n="338">And the great seal of the law was set like a sun on the margin .</l>
        <l n="339">Then from his leathern pouch the farmer threw on the table</l>
        <l n="340">Three times the old man 's fee in solid pieces of silver ;</l>
        <l n="341">And the notary rising , and blessing the bride and the bridegroom ,</l>
        <l n="342">Lifted aloft the tankard of ale and drank to their welfare .</l>
        <l n="343">Wiping the foam from his lip , he solemnly bowed and departed ,</l>
        <l n="344">While in silence the others sat and mused by the fireside ,</l>
        <l n="345">Till Evangeline brought the draught-board out of its corner .</l>
        <l n="346">Soon was the game begun . In friendly contention the old men</l>
        <l n="347">Laughed at each lucky hit , or unsuccessful manoeuver ,</l>
        <l n="348">Laughed when a man was crowned , or a breach was made in the king-row</l>
        <l n="349">Meanwhile apart , in the twilight gloom of a window 's embrasure ,</l>
        <l n="350">Sat the lovers , and whispered together , beholding the moon rise</l>
        <l n="351">Over the pallid sea and the silvery mist of the meadows .</l>
        <l n="352">Silently one by one , in the infinite meadows of heaven ,</l>
        <l n="353">Blossomed the lovely stars , the forget-me-nots of the angels .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="14">
        <l n="354">Thus was the evening passed . Anon the bell from the belfry</l>
        <l n="355">Rang out the hour of nine , the village curfew , and straightway</l>
        <l n="356">Rose the guests and departed ; and silence reigned in the household .</l>
        <l n="357">Many a farewell word and sweet good-night on the door-step</l>
        <l n="358">Lingered long in Evangeline 's heart , and filled it with gladness .</l>
        <l n="359">Carefully then were covered the embers that glowed on the hearth-stone ,</l>
        <l n="360">And on the oaken stairs resounded the tread of the farmer .</l>
        <l n="361">Soon with a soundless step the foot of Evangeline followed .</l>
        <l n="362">Up the staircase moved a luminous space in the darkness ,</l>
        <l n="363">Lighted less by the lamp than the shining face of the maiden .</l>
        <l n="364">Silent she passed the hall , and entered the door of her chamber .</l>
        <l n="365">Simple that chamber was , with its curtains of white , and its clothes-press</l>
        <l n="366">Ample and high , on whose spacious shelves were carefully folded</l>
        <l n="367">Linen and woollen stuffs , by the hand of Evangeline woven .</l>
        <l n="368">This was the precious dower she would bring to her husband in marriage ,</l>
        <l n="369">Better than flocks and herds , being proofs of her skill as a housewife .</l>
        <l n="370">Soon she extinguished her lamp , for the mellow and radiant moonlight</l>
        <l n="371">Streamed through the windows , and lighted the room , till the heart of the maiden</l>
        <l n="372">Swelled and obeyed its power , like the tremulous tides of the ocean .</l>
        <l n="373">Ah ! she was fair , exceeding fair to behold , as she stood with</l>
        <l n="374">Naked snow-white feet on the gleaming floor of her chamber !</l>
        <l n="375">Little she dreamed that below , among the trees of the orchard ,</l>
        <l n="376">Waited her lover and watched for the gleam of her lamp and her shadow .</l>
        <l n="377">Yet were her thoughts of him , and at times a feeling of sadness</l>
        <l n="378">Passed o'er her soul , as the sailing shade of clouds in the moonlight</l>
        <l n="379">Flitted across the floor and darkened the room for a moment .</l>
        <l n="380">And , as she gazed from the window , she saw serenely the moon pass</l>
        <l n="381">Forth from the folds of a cloud , and one star follow her footsteps ,</l>
        <l n="382">As out of Abraham 's tent young Ishmael wandered with Hagar !</l>

        <l n="383">Pleasantly rose next morn the sun on the village of Grand-Pre .</l>
        <l n="384">Pleasantly gleamed in the soft , sweet air the Basin of Minas ,</l>
        <l n="385">Where the ships , with their wavering shadows , were riding at anchor .</l>
        <l n="386">Life had long been astir in the village , and clamorous labor</l>
        <l n="387">Knocked with its hundred hands at the golden gates of the morning .</l>
        <l n="388">Now from the country around , from the farms and neighboring hamlets ,</l>
        <l n="389">Came in their holiday dresses the blithe Acadian peasants .</l>
        <l n="390">Many a glad good-morrow and jocund laugh from the young folk</l>
        <l n="391">Made the bright air brighter , as up from the numerous meadows ,</l>
        <l n="392">Where no path could be seen but the track of wheels in the greensward ,</l>
        <l n="393">Group after group appeared , and joined , or passed on the highway .</l>
        <l n="394">Long ere noon , in the village all sounds of labor were silenced .</l>
        <l n="395">Thronged were the streets with people ; and noisy groups at the house-doors</l>
        <l n="396">Sat in the cheerful sun , and rejoiced and gossiped together .</l>
        <l n="397">Every house was an inn , where all were welcomed and feasted ;</l>
        <l n="398">For with this simple people , who lived like brothers together ,</l>
        <l n="399">All things were held in common , and what one had was another 's .</l>
        <l n="400">Yet under Benedict 's roof hospitality seemed more abundant :</l>
        <l n="401">For Evangeline stood among the guests of her father ;</l>
        <l n="402">Bright was her face with smiles , and words of welcome and gladness</l>
        <l n="403">Fell from her beautiful lips , and blessed the cup as she gave it .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="16">
        <l n="404">Under the open sky , in the odorous air of the orchard ,</l>
        <l n="405">Stript of its golden fruit , was spread the feast of betrothal .</l>
        <l n="406">There in the shade of the porch were the priest and the notary seated ;</l>
        <l n="407">There good Benedict sat , and sturdy Basil the blacksmith .</l>
        <l n="408">Not far withdrawn from these , by the cider-press and the beehives ,</l>
        <l n="409">Michael the fiddler was placed , with the gayest of hearts and of waistcoats .</l>
        <l n="410">Shadow and light from the leaves alternately played on his snow-white</l>
        <l n="411">Hair , as it waved in the wind ; and the jolly face of the fiddler</l>
        <l n="412">Glowed like a living coal when the ashes are blown from the embers .</l>
        <l n="413">Gayly the old man sang to the vibrant sound of his fiddle ,</l>
        <l n="414">Tous les Bourgeois de Chartres , and Le Carillon de Dunkerque ,</l>
        <l n="415">And anon with his wooden shoes beat time to the music .</l>
        <l n="416">Merrily , merrily whirled the wheels of the dizzying dances</l>
        <l n="417">Under the orchard-trees and down the path to the meadows ;</l>
        <l n="418">Old folk and young together , and children mingled among them .</l>
        <l n="419">Fairest of all the maids was Evangeline , Benedict 's daughter !</l>
        <l n="420">Noblest of all the youths was Gabriel , son of the blacksmith !</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="17">
        <l n="421">So passed the morning away . And lo ! with a summons sonorous</l>
        <l n="422">Sounded the bell from its tower , and over the meadows a drum beat .</l>
        <l n="423">Thronged erelong was the church with men . Without , in the churchyard ,</l>
        <l n="424">Waited the women . They stood by the graves , and hung on the headstones</l>
        <l n="425">Garlands of autumn-leaves and evergreens fresh from the forest .</l>
        <l n="426">Then came the guard from the ships , and marching proudly among them</l>
        <l n="427">Entered the sacred portal . With loud and dissonant clangor</l>
        <l n="428">Echoed the sound of their brazen drums from ceiling and casement ,—</l>
        <l n="429">Echoed a moment only , and slowly the ponderous portal</l>
        <l n="430">Closed , and in silence the crowd awaited the will of the soldiers .</l>
        <l n="431">Then uprose their commander , and spoke from the steps of the altar ,</l>
        <l n="432">Holding aloft in his hands , with its seals , the royal commission .</l>
        <l n="433">“ You are convened this day , ” he said , “ by his Majesty 's orders .</l>
        <l n="434">Clement and kind has he been ; but how you have answered his kindness ,</l>
        <l n="435">Let your own hearts reply ! To my natural make and my temper</l>
        <l n="436">Painful the task is I do , which to you I know must be grievous .</l>
        <l n="437">Yet must I bow and obey , and deliver the will of our monarch ;</l>
        <l n="438">Namely , that all your lands , and dwellings , and cattle of all kinds</l>
        <l n="439">Forfeited be to the crown ; and that you yourselves from this province</l>
        <l n="440">Be transported to other lands . God grant you may dwell there</l>
        <l n="441">Ever as faithful subjects , a happy and peaceable people !</l>
        <l n="442">Prisoners now I declare you ; for such is his Majesty 's pleasure ! ”</l>
        <l n="443">As , when the air is serene in the sultry solstice of summer ,</l>
        <l n="444">Suddenly gathers a storm , and the deadly sling of the hailstones</l>
        <l n="445">Beats down the farmer 's corn in the field and shatters his windows ,</l>
        <l n="446">Hiding the sun , and strewing the ground with thatch from the house-roofs ,</l>
        <l n="447">Bellowing fly the herds , and seek to break their enclosures ;</l>
        <l n="448">So on the hearts of the people descended the words of the speaker .</l>
        <l n="449">Silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder , and then rose</l>
        <l n="450">Louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger ,</l>
        <l n="451">And , by one impulse moved , they madly rushed to the door-way .</l>
        <l n="452">Vain was the hope of escape ; and cries and fierce imprecations</l>
        <l n="453">Rang through the house of prayer ; and high o'er the heads of the others</l>
        <l n="454">Rose , with his arms uplifted , the figure of Basil the blacksmith ,</l>
        <l n="455">As , on a stormy sea , a spar is tossed by the billows .</l>
        <l n="456">Flushed was his face and distorted with passion ; and wildly he shouted ,—</l>
        <l n="457">“ Down with the tyrants of England ! we never have sworn them allegiance !</l>
        <l n="458">Death to these foreign soldiers , who seize on our homes and our harvests ! ”</l>
        <l n="459">More he fain would have said , but the merciless hand of a soldier</l>
        <l n="460">Smote him upon the mouth , and dragged him down to the pavement .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="18">
        <l n="461">In the midst of the strife and tumult of angry contention ,</l>
        <l n="462">Lo ! the door of the chancel opened , and Father Felician</l>
        <l n="463">Entered , with serious mien , and ascended the steps of the altar .</l>
        <l n="464">Raising his reverend hand , with a gesture he awed into silence</l>
        <l n="465">All that clamorous throng ; and thus he spake to his people ;</l>
        <l n="466">Deep were his tones and solemn ; in accents measured and mournful</l>
        <l n="467">Spake he , as , after the tocsin 's alarum , distinctly the clock strikes .</l>
        <l n="468">“ What is this that ye do , my children ? what madness has seized you ?</l>
        <l n="469">Forty years of my life have I labored among you , and taught you ,</l>
        <l n="470">Not in word alone , but in deed , to love one another !</l>
        <l n="471">Is this the fruit of my toils , of my vigils and prayers and privations ?</l>
        <l n="472">Have you so soon forgotten all lessons of love and forgiveness ?</l>
        <l n="473">This is the house of the Prince of Peace , and would you profane it</l>
        <l n="474">Thus with violent deeds and hearts overflowing with hatred ?</l>
        <l n="475">Lo ! where the crucified Christ from his cross is gazing upon you !</l>
        <l n="476">See ! in those sorrowful eyes what meekness and holy compassion !</l>
        <l n="477">Hark ! how those lips still repeat the prayer , ‘ O Father , forgive them ! ’</l>
        <l n="478">Let us repeat that prayer in the hour when the wicked assail us ,</l>
        <l n="479">Let us repeat it now , and say , ‘ O Father , forgive them ! ’ ”</l>
        <l n="480">Few were his words of rebuke , but deep in the hearts of his people</l>
        <l n="481">Sank they , and sobs of contrition succeeded the passionate outbreak ,</l>
        <l n="482">While they repeated his prayer , and said , “ O Father , forgive them ! ”</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="19">
        <l n="483">Then came the evening service . The tapers gleamed from the altar .</l>
        <l n="484">Fervent and deep was the voice of the priest and the people responded ,</l>
        <l n="485">Not with their lips alone , but their hearts ; and the Ave Maria</l>
        <l n="486">Sang they , and fell on their knees , and their souls , with devotion translated ,</l>
        <l n="487">Rose on the ardor of prayer , like Elijah ascending to heaven .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="20">
        <l n="488">Meanwhile had spread in the village the tidings of ill , and on all sides</l>
        <l n="489">Wandered , wailing , from house to house the women and children .</l>
        <l n="490">Long at her father 's door Evangeline stood , with her right hand</l>
        <l n="491">Shielding her eyes from the level rays of the sun , that , descending ,</l>
        <l n="492">Lighted the village street with mysterious splendor , and roofed each</l>
        <l n="493">Peasant 's cottage with golden thatch , and emblazoned its windows .</l>
        <l n="494">Long within had been spread the snow-white cloth on the table ;</l>
        <l n="495">There stood the wheaten loaf , and the honey fragrant with wild-flowers ;</l>
        <l n="496">There stood the tankard of ale , and the cheese fresh brought from the dairy ;</l>
        <l n="497">And , at the head of the board , the great arm-chair of the farmer .</l>
        <l n="498">Thus did Evangeline wait at her father 's door , as the sunset</l>
        <l n="499">Threw the long shadows of trees o'er the broad ambrosial meadows .</l>
        <l n="500">Ah ! on her spirit within a deeper shadow had fallen ,</l>
        <l n="501">And from the fields of her soul a fragrance celestial ascended ,—</l>
        <l n="502">Charity , meekness , love , and hope , and forgiveness , and patience !</l>
        <l n="503">Then , all-forgetful of self , she wandered into the village ,</l>
        <l n="504">Cheering with looks and words the mournful hearts of the women ,</l>
        <l n="505">As o'er the darkening fields with lingering steps they departed ,</l>
        <l n="506">Urged by their household cares , and the weary feet of their children .</l>
        <l n="507">Down sank the great red sun , and in golden , glimmering vapors</l>
        <l n="508">Veiled the light of his face , like the Prophet descending from Sinai .</l>
        <l n="509">Sweetly over the village the bell of the Angelus sounded .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="21">
        <l n="510">Meanwhile , amid the gloom , by the church Evangeline lingered .</l>
        <l n="511">All was silent within ; and in vain at the door and the windows</l>
        <l n="512">Stood she , and listened and looked , till , overcome by emotion ,</l>
        <l n="513">“ Gabriel ! ” cried she aloud with tremulous voice ; but no answer</l>
        <l n="514">Came from the graves of the dead , nor the gloomier grave of the living .</l>
        <l n="515">Slowly at length she returned to the tenantless house of her father .</l>
        <l n="516">Smouldered the fire on the hearth , on the board was the supper untasted ,</l>
        <l n="517">Empty and drear was each room , and haunted with phantoms of terror .</l>
        <l n="518">Sadly echoed her step on the stair and the floor of her chamber .</l>
        <l n="519">In the dead of the night she heard the disconsolate rain fall</l>
        <l n="520">Loud on the withered leaves of the sycamore-tree by the window .</l>
        <l n="521">Keenly the lightning flashed ; and the voice of the echoing thunder</l>
        <l n="522">Told her that God was in heaven , and governed the world he created !</l>
        <l n="523">Then she remembered the tale she had heard of the justice of Heaven ;</l>
        <l n="524">Soothed was her troubled soul , and she peacefully slumbered till morning .</l>

        <l n="538">Late in the afternoon , when the sun was near to his setting ,</l>
        <l n="539">Echoed far o'er the fields came the roll of drums from the churchyard .</l>
        <l n="540">Thither the women and children thronged . On a sudden the church-doors</l>

        <l n="547">Foremost the young men came ; and , raising together their voices ,</l>
        <l n="548">Sang with tremulous lips a chant of the Catholic Missions :—</l>

        <l n="551">Then the old men , as they marched , and the women that stood by the wayside</l>
        <l n="552">Joined in the sacred psalm , and the birds in the sunshine above them</l>

        <l n="556">Calmly and sadly she waited , until the procession approached her ,</l>
        <l n="557">And she beheld the face of Gabriel pale with emotion .</l>
        <l n="558">Team then filled her eyes , and , eagerly running to meet him ,</l>

        <l n="565">Heavier seemed with the weight of the heavy heart in his bosom .</l>
        <l n="566">But with a smile and a sigh , she clasped his neck and embraced him ,</l>
        <l n="567">Speaking words of endearment where words of comfort availed not .</l>
        <l n="568">Thus to the Gaspereau 's mouth moved on that mournful procession .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="25">
        <l n="569">There disorder prevailed , and the tumult and stir of embarking .</l>
        <l n="570">Busily plied the freighted boats ; and in the confusion</l>
        <l n="571">Wives were torn from their husbands , and mothers , too late , saw their children</l>
        <l n="572">Left on the land , extending their arms , with wildest entreaties .</l>
        <l n="573">So unto separate ships were Basil and Gabriel carried ,</l>
        <l n="574">While in despair on the shore Evangeline stood with her father .</l>
        <l n="575">Half the task was not done when the sun went down , and the twilight</l>
        <l n="576">Deepened and darkened around ; and in haste the refluent ocean</l>
        <l n="577">Fled away from the shore , and left the line of the sand-beach</l>
        <l n="578">Covered with waifs of the tide , with kelp and the slippery sea-weed .</l>
        <l n="579">Farther back in the midst of the household goods and the wagons ,</l>
        <l n="580">Like to a gypsy camp , or a leaguer after a battle ,</l>
        <l n="581">All escape cut off by the sea , and the sentinels near them ,</l>
        <l n="582">Lay encamped for the night the houseless Acadian farmers .</l>
        <l n="583">Back to its nethermost caves retreated the bellowing ocean ,</l>
        <l n="584">Dragging adown the beach the rattling pebbles , and leaving</l>
        <l n="585">Inland and far up the shore the stranded boats of the sailors .</l>
        <l n="586">Then , as the night descended , the herds returned from their pastures ;</l>
        <l n="587">Sweet was the moist still air with the odor of milk from their udders ;</l>
        <l n="588">Lowing they waited , and long , at the well-known bars of the farm-yard ,—</l>
        <l n="589">Waited and looked in vain for the voice and the hand of the milkmaid .</l>
        <l n="590">Silence reigned in the streets ; from the church no Angelus sounded ,</l>
        <l n="591">Rose no smoke from the roofs , and gleamed no lights from the windows .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="26">
        <l n="592">But on the shores meanwhile the evening fires had been kindled ,</l>
        <l n="593">Built of the drift-wood thrown on the sands from wrecks in the tempest .</l>
        <l n="594">Round them shapes of gloom and sorrowful faces were gathered ,</l>
        <l n="595">Voices of women were heard , and of men , and the crying of children .</l>
        <l n="596">Onward from fire to fire , as from hearth to hearth in his parish ,</l>
        <l n="597">Wandered the faithful priest , consoling and blessing and cheering ,</l>
        <l n="598">Like unto shipwrecked Paul on Melita 's desolate sea-shore .</l>
        <l n="599">Thus he approached the place where Evangeline sat with her father ,</l>
        <l n="600">And in the flickering light beheld the face of the old man ,</l>
        <l n="601">Haggard and hollow and wan , and without either thought or emotion ,</l>
        <l n="602">E'en as the face of a clock from which the hands have been taken .</l>
        <l n="603">Vainly Evangeline strove with words and caresses to cheer him ,</l>
        <l n="604">Vainly offered him food ; yet he moved not , he looked not , he spake not</l>
        <l n="605">But , with a vacant stare , ever gazed at the flickering fire-light .</l>
        <l n="606">“ Benedicite ! ” murmured the priest , in tones of compassion .</l>
        <l n="607">More he fain would have said , but his heart was full , and his accents</l>
        <l n="608">Faltered and paused on his lips , as the feet of a child on a threshold ,</l>
        <l n="609">Hushed by the scene he beholds , and the awful presence of sorrow .</l>
        <l n="610">Silently , therefore , he laid his hand on the head of the maiden ,</l>
        <l n="611">Raising his tearful eyes to the silent stars that above them</l>
        <l n="612">Moved on their way , unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals .</l>
        <l n="613">Then sat he down at her side , and they wept together in silence .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="27">
        <l n="614">Suddenly rose from the south a light , as in autumn the blood-red</l>
        <l n="615">Moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven , and o'er the horizon</l>
        <l n="616">Titan-like stretches its hundred hands upon mountain and meadow ,</l>
        <l n="617">Seizing the rocks and the rivers , and piling huge shadows together .</l>
        <l n="618">Broader and ever broader it gleamed on the roofs of the village ,</l>
        <l n="619">Gleamed on the sky and the sea , and the ships that lay in the roadstead .</l>
        <l n="620">Columns of shining smoke uprose , and flashes of flame were</l>
        <l n="621">Thrust through their folds and withdrawn , like the quivering hands of a martyr .</l>
        <l n="622">Then as the wind seized the gleeds and the burning thatch , and , uplifting ,</l>
        <l n="623">Whirled them aloft through the air , at once from a hundred house-tops</l>
        <l n="624">Started the sheeted smoke with flashes of flame intermingled .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="28">
        <l n="625">These things beheld in dismay the crowd on the shore and on shipboard .</l>
        <l n="626">Speechless at first they stood , then cried aloud in their anguish ,</l>
        <l n="627">“ We shall behold no more our homes in the village of Grand-Pre ! ”</l>
        <l n="628">Loud on a sudden the cocks began to crow in the farm-yards ,</l>
        <l n="629">Thinking the day had dawned ; and anon the lowing of cattle</l>
        <l n="630">Came on the evening breeze , by the barking of dogs interrupted .</l>
        <l n="631">Then rose a sound of dread , such as startles the sleeping encampments</l>
        <l n="632">Far in the western prairies or forests that skirt the Nebraska ,</l>
        <l n="633">When the wild horses affrighted sweep by with the speed of the whirlwind ,</l>
        <l n="634">Or the loud bellowing herds of buffaloes rush to the river .</l>
        <l n="635">Such was the sound that arose on the night , as the herds and the horses</l>
        <l n="636">Broke through their folds and fences , and madly rushed o'er the meadows .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="29">
        <l n="637">Overwhelmed with the sight , yet speechless , the priest and the maiden</l>
        <l n="638">Gazed on the scene of terror that reddened and widened before them ;</l>
        <l n="639">And as they turned at length to speak to their silent companion ,</l>
        <l n="640">Lo ! from his seat he had fallen , and stretched abroad on the sea-shore</l>
        <l n="641">Motionless lay his form , from which the soul had departed .</l>
        <l n="642">Slowly the priest uplifted the lifeless head , and the maiden</l>
        <l n="643">Knelt at her father 's side , and wailed aloud in her terror .</l>
        <l n="644">Then in a swoon she sank , and lay with her head on his bosom .</l>
        <l n="645">Through the long night she lay in deep , oblivious slumber ;</l>
        <l n="646">And when she woke from the trance , she beheld a multitude near her .</l>
        <l n="647">Faces of friends she beheld , that were mournfully gazing upon her ,</l>
        <l n="648">Pallid , with tearful eyes , and looks of saddest compassion .</l>
        <l n="649">Still the blaze of the burning village illumined the landscape ,</l>
        <l n="650">Reddened the sky overhead , and gleamed on the faces around her ,</l>
        <l n="651">And like the day of doom it seemed to her wavering senses .</l>
        <l n="652">Then a familiar voice she heard , as it said to the people ,—</l>
        <l n="653">“ Let us bury him here by the sea . When a happier season</l>
        <l n="654">Brings us again to our homes from the unknown land of our exile ,</l>
        <l n="655">Then shall his sacred dust be piously laid in the churchyard . ”</l>
        <l n="656">Such were the words of the priest . And there in haste by the sea-side ,</l>
        <l n="657">Having the glare of the burning village for funeral torches ,</l>
        <l n="658">But without bell or book , they buried the farmer of Grand-Pre .</l>
        <l n="659">And as the voice of the priest repeated the service of sorrow ,</l>
        <l n="660">Lo ! with a mournful sound , like the voice of a vast congregation ,</l>
        <l n="661">Solemnly answered the sea , and mingled its roar with the dirges .</l>
        <l n="662">‘ T was the returning tide , that afar from the waste of the ocean ,</l>
        <l n="663">With the first dawn of the day , came heaving and hurrying landward .</l>
        <l n="664">Then recommenced once more the stir and noise of embarking ;</l>
        <l n="665">And with the ebb of the tide the ships sailed out of the harbor ,</l>
        <l n="666">Leaving behind them the dead on the shore , and the village in ruins .</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="30">
        <l n="667">Many a weary year had passed since the burning of Grand-Pre ,</l>
        <l n="668">When on the falling tide the freighted vessels departed ,</l>
        <l n="669">Bearing a nation , with all its household gods , into exile .</l>
        <l n="670">Exile without an end , and without an example in story .</l>
        <l n="671">Far asunder , on separate coasts , the Acadians landed ;</l>
        <l n="672">Scattered were they , like flakes of snow , when the wind from the northeast</l>
        <l n="673">Strikes aslant through the fogs that darken the Banks of Newfoundland .</l>
        <l n="674">Friendless , homeless , hopeless , they wandered from city to city ,</l>
        <l n="675">From the cold lakes of the North to sultry Southern savannas ,—</l>
        <l n="676">From the bleak shores of the sea to the lands where the Father of Waters</l>
        <l n="677">Seizes the hills in his hands , and drags them down to the ocean ,</l>
        <l n="678">Deep in their sands to bury the scattered bones of the mammoth .</l>
        <l n="679">Friends they sought and homes ; and many , despairing , heart-broken ,</l>
        <l n="680">Asked of the earth but a grave , and no longer a friend nor a fireside .</l>
        <l n="681">Written their history stands on tablets of stone in the churchyards .</l>
        <l n="682">Long among them was seen a maiden who waited and wandered ,</l>
        <l n="683">Lowly and meek in spirit , and patiently suffering all things .</l>
        <l n="684">Fair was she and young ; but , alas ! before her extended ,</l>
        <l n="685">Dreary and vast and silent , the desert of life , with its pathway</l>
        <l n="686">Marked by the graves of those who had sorrowed and suffered before her ,</l>
        <l n="687">Passions long extinguished , and hopes long dead and abandoned ,</l>
        <l n="688">As the emigrant 's way o'er the Western desert is marked by</l>
        <l n="689">Camp-fires long consumed , and bones that bleach in the sunshine .</l>
        <l n="690">Something there was in her life incomplete , imperfect , unfinished ;</l>
        <l n="691">As if a morning of June , with all its music and sunshine ,</l>
        <l n="692">Suddenly paused in the sky , and , fading , slowly descended</l>
        <l n="693">Into the east again , from whence it late had arisen .</l>
        <l n="694">Sometimes she lingered in towns , till , urged by the fever within her ,</l>
        <l n="695">Urged by a restless longing , the hunger and thirst of the spirit ,</l>
        <l n="696">She would commence again her endless search and endeavor ;</l>
        <l n="697">Sometimes in churchyards strayed , and gazed on the crosses and tombstones ,</l>
        <l n="698">Sat by some nameless grave , and thought that perhaps in its bosom</l>
        <l n="699">He was already at rest , and she longed to slumber beside him .</l>
        <l n="700">Sometimes a rumor , a hearsay , an inarticulate whisper ,</l>
        <l n="701">Came with its airy hand to point and beckon her forward .</l>
        <l n="702">Sometimes she spake with those who had seen her beloved and known him ,</l>
        <l n="703">But it was long ago , in some far-off place or forgotten .</l>
        <l n="704">“ Gabriel Lajeunesse ! ” they said ; “ yes ! we have seen him .</l>
        <l n="705">He was with Basil the blacksmith , and both have gone to the prairies ;</l>
        <l n="706">Coureurs-des-Bois are they , and famous hunters and trappers . ”</l>
        <l n="707">“ Gabriel Lajeunesse ! ” said others ; “ O yes ! we have seen him .</l>
        <l n="708">He is a Voyageur in the lowlands of Louisiana . ”</l>
        <l n="709">Then would they say , “ Dear child ! why dream and wait for him longer ?</l>
        <l n="710">Are there not other youths as fair as Gabriel ? others</l>
        <l n="711">Who have hearts as tender and true , and spirits as loyal ?</l>
        <l n="712">Here is Baptiste Leblanc , the notary 's son , who has loved thee</l>
        <l n="713">Many a tedious year ; come , give him thy hand and be happy !</l>
        <l n="714">Thou art too fair to be left to braid St. Catherine 's tresses . ”</l>
        <l n="715">Then would Evangeline answer , serenely but sadly , “ I cannot !</l>
        <l n="716">Whither my heart has gone , there follows my hand , and not elsewhere .</l>
        <l n="717">For when the heart goes before , like a lamp , and illumines the pathway ,</l>
        <l n="718">Many things are made clear , that else lie hidden in darkness . ”</l>
        <l n="719">Thereupon the priest , her friend and father-confessor ,</l>
        <l n="720">Said , with a smile , “ O daughter ! thy God thus speaketh within thee !</l>
        <l n="721">Talk not of wasted affection , affection never was wasted ;</l>
        <l n="722">If it enrich not the heart of another , its waters , returning</l>
        <l n="723">Back to their springs , like the rain , shall fill them full of refreshment ;</l>
        <l n="724">That which the fountain sends forth returns again to the fountain .</l>
        <l n="725">Patience ; accomplish thy labor ; accomplish thy work of affection !</l>
        <l n="726">Sorrow and silence are strong , and patient endurance is godlike .</l>
        <l n="727">Therefore accomplish thy labor of love , till the heart is made godlike ,</l>
        <l n="728">Purified , strengthened , perfected , and rendered more worthy of heaven ! ”</l>
        <l n="729">Cheered by the good man 's words , Evangeline labored and waited .</l>
        <l n="730">Still in her heart she heard the funeral dirge of the ocean ,</l>
        <l n="731">But with its sound there was mingled a voice that whispered , “ Despair not ? ”</l>
        <l n="732">Thus did that poor soul wander in want and cheerless discomfort</l>
        <l n="733">Bleeding , barefooted , over the shards and thorns of existence .</l>
        <l n="734">Let me essay , O Muse ! to follow the wanderer 's footsteps ;—</l>
        <l n="735">Not through each devious path , each changeful year of existence ;</l>
        <l n="736">But as a traveller follows a streamlet 's course through the valley :</l>
        <l n="737">Far from its margin at times , and seeing the gleam of its water</l>
        <l n="738">Here and there , in some open space , and at intervals only ;</l>
        <l n="739">Then drawing nearer its banks , through sylvan glooms that conceal it ,</l>
        <l n="740">Though he behold it not , he can hear its continuous murmur ;</l>
        <l n="741">Happy , at length , if he find the spot where it reaches an outlet .</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="31">
        <l n="742">It was the month of May . Far down the Beautiful River ,</l>
        <l n="743">Past the Ohio shore and past the mouth of the Wabash ,</l>
        <l n="744">Into the golden stream of the broad and swift Mississippi ,</l>
        <l n="745">Floated a cumbrous boat , that was rowed by Acadian boatmen .</l>
        <l n="746">It was a band of exiles : a raft , as it were , from the shipwrecked</l>
        <l n="747">Nation , scattered along the coast , now floating together ,</l>
        <l n="748">Bound by the bonds of a common belief and a common misfortune ;</l>
        <l n="749">Men and women and children , who , guided by hope or by hearsay ,</l>
        <l n="750">Sought for their kith and their kin among the few-acred farmers</l>
        <l n="751">On the Acadian coast , and the prairies of fair Opelousas .</l>
        <l n="752">With them Evangeline went , and her guide , the Father Felician .</l>
        <l n="753">Onward o'er sunken sands , through a wilderness sombre with forests ,</l>
        <l n="754">Day after day they glided adown the turbulent river ;</l>
        <l n="755">Night after night , by their blazing fires , encamped on its borders .</l>
        <l n="756">Now through rushing chutes , among green islands , where plumelike</l>
        <l n="757">Cotton-trees nodded their shadowy crests , they swept with the current ,</l>
        <l n="758">Then emerged into broad lagoons , where silvery sand-bars</l>
        <l n="759">Lay in the stream , and along the wimpling waves of their margin ,</l>
        <l n="760">Shining with snow-white plumes , large flocks of pelicans waded .</l>
        <l n="761">Level the landscape grew , and along the shores of the river ,</l>
        <l n="762">Shaded by china-trees , in the midst of luxuriant gardens ,</l>
        <l n="763">Stood the houses of planters , with negro-cabins and dove-cots .</l>
        <l n="764">They were approaching the region where reigns perpetual summer ,</l>
        <l n="765">Where through the Golden Coast , and groves of orange and citron ,</l>
        <l n="766">Sweeps with majestic curve the river away to the eastward .</l>
        <l n="767">They , too , swerved from their course ; and , entering the Bayou of Plaquemine ,</l>
        <l n="768">Soon were lost in a maze of sluggish and devious waters ,</l>
        <l n="769">Which , like a network of steel , extended in every direction .</l>
        <l n="770">Over their heads the towering and tenebrous boughs of the cypress</l>
        <l n="771">Met in a dusky arch , and trailing mosses in mid-air</l>
        <l n="772">Waved like banners that hang on the walls of ancient cathedrals .</l>
        <l n="773">Deathlike the silence seemed , and unbroken , save by the herons</l>
        <l n="774">Home to their roasts in the cedar-trees returning at sunset ,</l>
        <l n="775">Or by the owl , as he greeted the moon with demoniac laughter .</l>
        <l n="776">Lovely the moonlight was as it glanced and gleamed on the water ,</l>
        <l n="777">Gleamed on the columns of cypress and cedar sustaining the arches ,</l>
        <l n="778">Down through whose broken vaults it fell as through chinks in a ruin .</l>
        <l n="779">Dreamlike , and indistinct , and strange were all things around them ;</l>
        <l n="780">And o'er their spirits there came a feeling of wonder and sadness ,—</l>
        <l n="781">Strange forebodings of ill , unseen and that cannot be compassed .</l>
        <l n="782">As , at the tramp of a horse 's hoof on the turf of the prairies ,</l>
        <l n="783">Far in advance are closed the leaves of the shrinking mimosa ,</l>
        <l n="784">So , at the hoof-beats of fate , with sad forebodings of evil ,</l>
        <l n="785">Shrinks and closes the heart , ere the stroke of doom has attained it .</l>
        <l n="786">But Evangeline 's heart was sustained by a vision , that faintly</l>
        <l n="787">Floated before her eyes , and beckoned her on through the moonlight .</l>
        <l n="788">It was the thought of her brain that assumed the shape of a phantom .</l>
        <l n="789">Through those shadowy aisles had Gabriel wandered before her ,</l>
        <l n="790">And every stroke of the oar now brought him nearer and nearer .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="32">
        <l n="791">Then in his place , at the prow of the boat , rose one of the oarsmen ,</l>
        <l n="792">And , as a signal sound , if others like them peradventure</l>
        <l n="793">Sailed on those gloomy and midnight streams , blew a blast on his bugle .</l>
        <l n="794">Wild through the dark colonnades and corridors leafy the blast rang ,</l>
        <l n="795">Breaking the seal of silence , and giving tongues to the forest .</l>
        <l n="796">Soundless above them the banners of moss just stirred to the music .</l>
        <l n="797">Multitudinous echoes awoke and died in the distance ,</l>
        <l n="798">Over the watery floor , and beneath the reverberant branches ;</l>
        <l n="799">But not a voice replied ; no answer came from the darkness ;</l>
        <l n="800">And , when the echoes had ceased , like a sense of pain was the silence .</l>
        <l n="801">Then Evangeline slept ; but the boatmen rowed through the midnight ,</l>
        <l n="802">Silent at times , then singing familiar Canadian boat-songs ,</l>
        <l n="803">Such as they sang of old on their own Acadian rivers ,</l>
        <l n="804">While through the night were heard the mysterious sounds of the desert ,</l>
        <l n="805">Far off ,— indistinct ,— as of wave or wind in the forest ,</l>
        <l n="806">Mixed with the whoop of the crane and the roar of the grim alligator .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="33">
        <l n="807">Thus ere another noon they emerged from the shades ; and before them</l>
        <l n="808">Lay , in the golden sun , the lakes of the Atchafalaya .</l>
        <l n="809">Water-lilies in myriads rocked on the slight undulations</l>
        <l n="810">Made by the passing oars , and , resplendent in beauty , the lotus</l>
        <l n="811">Lifted her golden crown above the heads of the boatmen .</l>
        <l n="812">Faint was the air with the odorous breath of magnolia blossoms ,</l>
        <l n="813">And with the heat of noon ; and numberless sylvan islands ,</l>
        <l n="814">Fragrant and thickly embowered with blossoming hedges of roses ,</l>
        <l n="815">Near to whose shores they glided along , invited to slumber .</l>
        <l n="816">Soon by the fairest of these their weary oars were suspended .</l>
        <l n="817">Under the boughs of Wachita willows , that grew by the margin ,</l>
        <l n="818">Safely their boat was moored ; and scattered about on the greensward ,</l>
        <l n="819">Tired with their midnight toil , the weary travellers slumbered .</l>
        <l n="820">Over them vast and high extended the cope of a cedar .</l>
        <l n="821">Swinging from its great arms , the trumpet-flower and the grapevine</l>
        <l n="822">Hung their ladder of ropes aloft like the ladder of Jacob ,</l>
        <l n="823">On whose pendulous stairs the angels ascending , descending ,</l>
        <l n="824">Were the swift humming-birds , that flitted from blossom to blossom .</l>
        <l n="825">Such was the vision Evangeline saw as she slumbered beneath it .</l>
        <l n="826">Filled was her heart with love , and the dawn of an opening heaven</l>
        <l n="827">Lighted her soul in sleep with the glory of regions celestial .</l>

        <l n="828">Nearer , ever nearer , among the numberless islands ,</l>
        <l n="829">Darted a light , swift boat , that sped away o'er the water ,</l>
        <l n="830">Urged on its course by the sinewy arms of hunters and trappers .</l>
        <l n="831">Northward its prow was turned , to the land of the bison and beaver .</l>
        <l n="832">At the helm sat a youth , with countenance thoughtful and careworn .</l>
        <l n="833">Dark and neglected locks overshadowed his brow , and a sadness</l>
        <l n="834">Somewhat beyond his years on his face was legibly written .</l>
        <l n="835">Gabriel was it , who , weary with waiting , unhappy and restless ,</l>
        <l n="836">Sought in the Western wilds oblivion of self and of sorrow .</l>
        <l n="837">Swiftly they glided along , close under the lee of the island ,</l>
        <l n="838">But by the opposite bank , and behind a screen of palmettos ,</l>
        <l n="839">So that they saw not the boat , where it lay concealed in the willows ,</l>
        <l n="840">All undisturbed by the dash of their oars , and unseen , were the sleepers ,</l>
        <l n="841">Angel of God was there none to awaken the slumbering maiden .</l>
        <l n="842">Swiftly they glided away , like the shade of a cloud on the prairie .</l>
        <l n="843">After the sound of their oars on the tholes had died in the distance ,</l>
        <l n="844">As from a magic trance the sleepers awoke , and the maiden</l>
        <l n="845">Said with a sigh to the friendly priest , “ O Father Felician !</l>
        <l n="846">Something says in my heart that near me Gabriel wanders .</l>
        <l n="847">Is it a foolish dream , an idle and vague superstition ?</l>
        <l n="848">Or has an angel passed , and revealed the truth to my spirit ? ”</l>
        <l n="849">Then , with a blush , she added , “ Alas for my credulous fancy !</l>
        <l n="850">Unto ears like thine such words as these have no meaning . ”</l>
        <l n="851">But made answer the reverend man , and he smiled as he answered ,—</l>
        <l n="852">“ Daughter , thy words are not idle ; nor are they to me without meaning .</l>
        <l n="853">Feeling is deep and still ; and the word that floats on the surface</l>
        <l n="854">Is as the tossing buoy , that betrays where the anchor is hidden .</l>
        <l n="855">Therefore trust to thy heart , and to what the world calls illusions .</l>
        <l n="856">Gabriel truly is near thee ; for not far away to the southward ,</l>
        <l n="857">On the banks of the Teche , are the towns of St. Maur and St. Martin .</l>
        <l n="858">There the long-wandering bride shall be given again to her bridegroom ,</l>
        <l n="859">There the long-absent pastor regain his flock and his sheepfold .</l>
        <l n="860">Beautiful is the land , with its prairies and forests of fruit-trees ;</l>
        <l n="861">Under the feet a garden of flowers , and the bluest of heavens</l>
        <l n="862">Bending above , and resting its dome on the walls of the forest .</l>
        <l n="863">They who dwell there have named it the Eden of Louisiana . ”</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="35">
        <l n="864">With these words of cheer they arose and continued their journey .</l>
        <l n="865">Softly the evening came . The sun from the western horizon</l>
        <l n="866">Like a magician extended his golden wand o'er the landscape ;</l>
        <l n="867">Twinkling vapors arose ; and sky and water and forest</l>
        <l n="868">Seemed all on fire at the touch , and melted and mingled together .</l>
        <l n="869">Hanging between two skies , a cloud with edges of silver ,</l>
        <l n="870">Floated the boat , with its dripping oars , on the motionless water .</l>
        <l n="871">Filled was Evangeline 's heart with inexpressible sweetness .</l>
        <l n="872">Touched by the magic spell , the sacred fountains of feeling</l>
        <l n="873">Glowed with the light of love , as the skies and waters around her .</l>
        <l n="874">Then from a neighboring thicket the mocking-bird , wildest of singers ,</l>
        <l n="875">Swinging aloft on a willow spray that hung o'er the water ,</l>
        <l n="876">Shook from his little throat such floods of delirious music ,</l>
        <l n="877">That the whole air and the woods and the waves seemed silent to listen .</l>
        <l n="878">Plaintive at first were the tones and sad ; then soaring to madness</l>
        <l n="879">Seemed they to follow or guide the revel of frenzied Bacchantes .</l>
        <l n="880">Single notes were then heard , in sorrowful , low lamentation ;</l>
        <l n="881">Till , having gathered them all , he flung them abroad in derision ,</l>
        <l n="882">As when , after a storm , a gust of wind through the tree-tops</l>
        <l n="883">Shakes down the rattling rain in a crystal shower on the branches .</l>
        <l n="884">With such a prelude as this , and hearts that throbbed with emotion ,</l>
        <l n="885">Slowly they entered the Teche , where it flows through the green Opelousas ,</l>
        <l n="886">And , through the amber air , above the crest of the woodland ,</l>
        <l n="887">Saw the column of smoke that arose from a neighboring dwelling ;—</l>
        <l n="888">Sounds of a horn they heard , and the distant lowing of cattle .</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="36">
        <l n="889">Near to the bank of the river , o'ershadowed by oaks , from whose branches</l>
        <l n="890">Garlands of Spanish moss and of mystic mistletoe flaunted ,</l>
        <l n="891">Such as the Druids cut down with golden hatchets at Yule-tide ,</l>
        <l n="892">Stood , secluded and still , the house of the herdsman . A garden</l>
        <l n="893">Girded it round about with a belt of luxuriant blossoms ,</l>
        <l n="894">Filling the air with fragrance . The house itself was of timbers</l>
        <l n="895">Hewn from the cypress-tree , and carefully fitted together .</l>
        <l n="896">Large and low was the roof ; and on slender columns supported ,</l>
        <l n="897">Rose-wreathed , vine-encircled , a broad and spacious veranda ,</l>
        <l n="898">Haunt of the humming-bird and the bee , extended around it .</l>
        <l n="899">At each end of the house , amid the flowers of the garden ,</l>
        <l n="900">Stationed the dove-cots were , as love 's perpetual symbol ,</l>
        <l n="901">Scenes of endless wooing , and endless contentions of rivals .</l>
        <l n="902">Silence reigned o'er the place . The line of shadow and sunshine</l>
        <l n="903">Ran near the tops of the trees ; but the house itself was in shadow ,</l>
        <l n="904">And from its chimney-top , ascending and slowly expanding</l>
        <l n="905">Into the evening air , a thin blue column of smoke rose .</l>
        <l n="906">In the rear of the house , from the garden gate , ran a pathway</l>
        <l n="907">Through the great groves of oak to the skirts of the limitless prairie ,</l>
        <l n="908">Into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending .</l>
        <l n="909">Full in his track of light , like ships with shadowy canvas</l>
        <l n="910">Hanging loose from their spars in a motionless calm in the tropics ,</l>
        <l n="911">Stood a cluster of trees , with tangled cordage of grapevines .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="37">
        <l n="912">Just where the woodlands met the flowery surf of the prairie ,</l>
        <l n="913">Mounted upon his horse , with Spanish saddle and stirrups ,</l>
        <l n="914">Sat a herdsman , arrayed in gaiters and doublet of deerskin .</l>
        <l n="915">Broad and brown was the face that from under the Spanish sombrero</l>
        <l n="916">Gazed on the peaceful scene , with the lordly look of its master .</l>
        <l n="917">Round about him were numberless herds of kine , that were grazing</l>
        <l n="918">Quietly in the meadows , and breathing the vapory freshness</l>
        <l n="919">That uprose from the river , and spread itself over the landscape .</l>
        <l n="920">Slowly lifting the horn that hung at his side , and expanding</l>
        <l n="921">Fully his broad , deep chest , he blew a blast , that resounded</l>
        <l n="922">Wildly and sweet and far , through the still damp air of the evening .</l>
        <l n="923">Suddenly out of the grass the long white horns of the cattle</l>
        <l n="924">Rose like flakes of foam on the adverse currents of ocean .</l>
        <l n="925">Silent a moment they gazed , then bellowing rushed o'er the prairie ,</l>
        <l n="926">And the whole mass became a cloud , a shade in the distance .</l>
        <l n="927">Then , as the herdsman turned to the house , through the gate of the garden</l>
        <l n="928">Saw he the forms of the priest and the maiden advancing to meet him .</l>
        <l n="929">Suddenly down from his horse he sprang in amazement , and forward</l>
        <l n="930">Rushed with extended arms and exclamations of wonder ;</l>
        <l n="931">When they beheld his face , they recognized Basil the blacksmith .</l>
        <l n="932">Hearty his welcome was , as he led his guests to the garden .</l>
        <l n="933">There in an arbor of roses with endless question and answer</l>
        <l n="934">Gave they vent to their hearts , and renewed their friendly embraces ,</l>
        <l n="935">Laughing and weeping by turns , or sitting silent and thoughtful .</l>
        <l n="936">Thoughtful , for Gabriel came not ; and now dark doubts and misgivings</l>
        <l n="937">Stole o'er the maiden 's heart ; and Basil , somewhat embarrassed ,</l>
        <l n="938">Broke the silence and said , “ If you came by the Atchafalaya ,</l>
        <l n="939">How have you nowhere encountered my Gabriel 's boat on the bayous ? ”</l>
        <l n="940">Over Evangeline 's face at the words of Basil a shade passed .</l>
        <l n="941">Tears came into her eyes , and she said , with a tremulous accent ,</l>
        <l n="942">“ Gone ? is Gabriel gone ? ” and , concealing her face on his shoulder ,</l>
        <l n="943">All her o'erburdened heart gave way , and she wept and lamented .</l>
        <l n="944">Then the good Basil said ,— and his voice grew blithe as he said it ,—</l>
        <l n="945">“ Be of good cheer , my child ; it is only to-day he departed .</l>
        <l n="946">Foolish boy ! he has left me alone with my herds and my horses .</l>
        <l n="947">Moody and restless grown , and tried and troubled , his spirit</l>
        <l n="948">Could no longer endure the calm of this quiet existence .</l>
        <l n="949">Thinking ever of thee , uncertain and sorrowful ever ,</l>
        <l n="950">Ever silent , or speaking only of thee and his troubles ,</l>
        <l n="951">He at length had become so tedious to men and to maidens ,</l>
        <l n="952">Tedious even to me , that at length I bethought me , and sent him</l>
        <l n="953">Unto the town of Adayes to trade for mules with the Spaniards .</l>
        <l n="954">Thence he will follow the Indian trails to the Ozark Mountains ,</l>
        <l n="955">Hunting for furs in the forests , on rivers trapping the beaver .</l>
        <l n="956">Therefore be of good cheer ; we will follow the fugitive lover ;</l>
        <l n="957">He is not far on his way , and the Fates and the streams are against him .</l>
        <l n="958">Up and away to-morrow , and through the red dew of the morning</l>
        <l n="959">We will follow him fast , and bring him back to his prison . ”</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="38">
        <l n="960">Then glad voices were heard , and up from the banks of the river ,</l>
        <l n="961">Borne aloft on his comrades ’ arms , came Michael the fiddler .</l>
        <l n="962">Long under Basil 's roof had he lived like a god on Olympus ,</l>
        <l n="963">Having no other care than dispensing music to mortals .</l>
        <l n="964">Far renowned was he for his silver locks and his fiddle .</l>
        <l n="965">“ Long live Michael , ” they cried , “ our brave Acadian minstrel ! ”</l>
        <l n="966">As they bore him aloft in triumphal procession ; and straightway</l>
        <l n="967">Father Felician advanced with Evangeline , greeting the old man</l>
        <l n="968">Kindly and oft , and recalling the past , while Basil , enraptured ,</l>
        <l n="969">Hailed with hilarious joy his old companions and gossips ,</l>
        <l n="970">Laughing loud and long , and embracing mothers and daughters .</l>
        <l n="971">Much they marvelled to see the wealth of the cidevant blacksmith ,</l>
        <l n="972">All his domains and his herds , and his patriarchal demeanor ;</l>
        <l n="973">Much they marvelled to hear his tales of the soil and the climate ,</l>
        <l n="974">And of the prairie ; whose numberless herds were his who would take them ;</l>
        <l n="975">Each one thought in his heart , that he , too , would go and do likewise .</l>
        <l n="976">Thus they ascended the steps , and , crossing the breezy veranda ,</l>
        <l n="977">Entered the hall of the house , where already the supper of Basil</l>
        <l n="978">Waited his late return ; and they rested and feasted together .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="39">
        <l n="979">Over the joyous feast the sudden darkness descended .</l>
        <l n="980">All was silent without , and , illuming the landscape with silver ,</l>
        <l n="981">Fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars ; but within doors ,</l>
        <l n="982">Brighter than these , shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight .</l>
        <l n="983">Then from his station aloft , at the head of the table , the herdsman</l>
        <l n="984">Poured forth his heart and his wine together in endless profusion .</l>
        <l n="985">Lighting his pipe , that was filled with sweet Natchitoches tobacco ,</l>
        <l n="986">Thus he spake to his guests , who listened , and smiled as they listened :—</l>
        <l n="987">“ Welcome once more , my friends , who long have been friendless and homeless ,</l>
        <l n="988">Welcome once more to a home , that is better perchance than the old one !</l>
        <l n="989">Here no hungry winter congeals our blood like the rivers ;</l>
        <l n="990">Here no stony ground provokes the wrath of the farmer .</l>
        <l n="991">Smoothly the ploughshare runs through the soil , as a keel through the water .</l>
        <l n="992">All the year round the orange-groves are in blossom ; and grass grows</l>
        <l n="993">More in a single night than a whole Canadian summer .</l>
        <l n="994">Here , too , numberless herds run wild and unclaimed in the prairies ;</l>
        <l n="995">Here , too , lands may be had for the asking , and forests of timber</l>
        <l n="996">With a few blows of the axe are hewn and framed into houses .</l>
        <l n="997">After your houses are built , and your fields are yellow with harvests ,</l>
        <l n="998">No King George of England shall drive you away from your homesteads ,</l>
        <l n="999">Burning your dwellings and barns , and stealing your farms and your cattle . ”</l>
        <l n="1000">Speaking these words , he blew a wrathful cloud from his nostrils ,</l>
        <l n="1001">While his huge , brown hand came thundering down on the table ,</l>
        <l n="1002">So that the guests all started ; and Father Felician , astounded ,</l>
        <l n="1003">Suddenly paused , with a pinch of snuff half-way to his nostrils .</l>
        <l n="1004">But the brave Basil resumed , and his words were milder and gayer :—</l>
        <l n="1005">“ Only beware of the fever , my friends , beware of the fever !</l>
        <l n="1006">For it is not like that of our cold Acadian climate ,</l>
        <l n="1007">Cured by wearing a spider hung round one 's neck in a nutshell ! ”</l>
        <l n="1008">Then there were voices heard at the door , and footsteps approaching</l>
        <l n="1009">Sounded upon the stairs and the floor of the breezy veranda .</l>
        <l n="1010">It was the neighboring Creoles and small Acadian planters ,</l>
        <l n="1011">Who had been summoned all to the house of Basil the Herdsman .</l>
        <l n="1012">Merry the meeting was of ancient comrades and neighbors :</l>
        <l n="1013">Friend clasped friend in his arms ; and they who before were as strangers ,</l>
        <l n="1014">Meeting in exile , became straightway as friends to each other ,</l>
        <l n="1015">Drawn by the gentle bond of a common country together .</l>
        <l n="1016">But in the neighboring hall a strain of music , proceeding</l>
        <l n="1017">From the accordant strings of Michael 's melodious fiddle ,</l>
        <l n="1018">Broke up all further speech . Away , like children delighted ,</l>
        <l n="1019">All things forgotten beside , they gave themselves to the maddening</l>
        <l n="1020">Whirl of the dizzy dance , as it swept and swayed to the music ,</l>
        <l n="1021">Dreamlike , with beaming eyes and the rush of fluttering garments .</l>

        <l n="1022">Meanwhile , apart , at the head of the hall , the priest and the herdsman</l>
        <l n="1023">Sat , conversing together of past and present and future ;</l>
        <l n="1024">While Evangeline stood like one entranced , for within her</l>
        <l n="1025">Olden memories rose , and loud in the midst of the music</l>
        <l n="1026">Heard she the sound of the sea , and an irrepressible sadness</l>
        <l n="1027">Came o'er her heart , and unseen she stole forth into the garden .</l>
        <l n="1028">Beautiful was the night . Behind the black wall of the forest ,</l>
        <l n="1029">Tipping its summit with silver , arose the moon . On the river</l>
        <l n="1030">Fell here and there through the branches a tremulous gleam of the moonlight ,</l>
        <l n="1031">Like the sweet thoughts of love on a darkened and devious spirit .</l>
        <l n="1032">Nearer and round about her , the manifold flowers of the garden</l>
        <l n="1033">Poured out their souls in odors , that were their prayers and confessions</l>
        <l n="1034">Unto the night , as it went its way , like a silent Carthusian .</l>
        <l n="1035">Fuller of fragrance than they , and as heavy with shadows and night-dews ,</l>
        <l n="1036">Hung the heart of the maiden . The calm and the magical moonlight</l>
        <l n="1037">Seemed to inundate her soul with indefinable longing ;</l>
        <l n="1038">As , through the garden gate , and beneath the shade of the oak-trees ,</l>
        <l n="1039">Passed she along the path to the edge of the measureless prairie .</l>
        <l n="1040">Silent it lay , with a silvery haze upon it , and fire-flies</l>
        <l n="1041">Gleaming and floating away in mingled and infinite numbers .</l>
        <l n="1042">Over her head the stars , the thoughts of God in the heavens ,</l>
        <l n="1043">Shone on the eyes of man who had ceased to marvel and worship ,</l>
        <l n="1044">Save when a blazing comet was seen on the walls of that temple ,</l>
        <l n="1045">As if a hand had appeared and written upon them , “ Upharsin . ”</l>
        <l n="1046">And the soul of the maiden , between the stars and the fire-flies ,</l>
        <l n="1047">Wandered alone , and she cried , “ O Gabriel ! O my beloved !</l>
        <l n="1048">Art thou so near unto me , and yet I cannot behold thee ?</l>
        <l n="1049">Art thou so near unto me , and yet thy voice does not reach me ?</l>
        <l n="1050">Ah ! how often thy feet have trod this path to the prairie !</l>
        <l n="1051">Ah ! how often thine eyes have looked on the woodlands around me !</l>
        <l n="1052">Ah ! how often beneath this oak , returning from labor ,</l>
        <l n="1053">Thou hast lain down to rest and to dream of me in thy slumbers !</l>
        <l n="1054">When shall these eyes behold , these arms be folded about thee ? ”</l>
        <l n="1055">Loud and sudden and near the note of a whippoorwill sounded</l>
        <l n="1056">Like a flute in the woods ; and anon , through the neighboring thickets ,</l>
        <l n="1057">Farther and farther away it floated and dropped into silence .</l>
        <l n="1058">“ Patience ! ” whispered the oaks from oracular caverns of darkness :</l>
        <l n="1059">And , from the moonlit meadow , a sigh responded , “ To-morrow ! ”</l>

        <l n="1060">Bright rose the sun next day ; and all the flowers of the garden</l>
        <l n="1061">Bathed his shining feet with their tears , and anointed his tresses</l>
        <l n="1062">With the delicious balm that they bore in their vases of crystal .</l>
        <l n="1063">“ Farewell ! ” said the priest , as he stood at the shadowy threshold ;</l>
        <l n="1064">“ See that you bring us the Prodigal Son from his fasting and famine ,</l>
        <l n="1065">And , too , the Foolish Virgin , who slept when the bridegroom was coming . ”</l>
        <l n="1066">“ Farewell ! ” answered the maiden , and , smiling , with Basil descended</l>
        <l n="1067">Down to the river 's brink , where the boatmen already were waiting .</l>
        <l n="1068">Thus beginning their journey with morning , and sunshine , and gladness ,</l>
        <l n="1069">Swiftly they followed the flight of him who was speeding before them ,</l>
        <l n="1070">Blown by the blast of fate like a dead leaf over the desert .</l>
        <l n="1071">Not that day , nor the next , nor yet the day that succeeded ,</l>
        <l n="1072">Found they trace of his course , in lake or forest or river ,</l>
        <l n="1073">Nor , after many days , had they found him ; but vague and uncertain</l>
        <l n="1074">Rumors alone were their guides through a wild and desolate Country ;</l>
        <l n="1075">Till , at the little inn of the Spanish town of Adayes ,</l>
        <l n="1076">Weary and worn , they alighted , and learned from the garrulous landlord ,</l>
        <l n="1077">That on the day before , with horses and guides and companions ,</l>
        <l n="1078">Gabriel left the village , and took the road of the prairies .</l>

        <l n="1079">Far in the West there lies a desert land , where the mountains</l>
        <l n="1080">Lift , through perpetual snows , their lofty and luminous summits .</l>
        <l n="1081">Down from their jagged , deep ravines , where the gorge , like a gateway ,</l>
        <l n="1082">Opens a passage rude to the wheels of the emigrant 's wagon ,</l>
        <l n="1083">Westward the Oregon flows and the Walleway and Owyhee .</l>
        <l n="1084">Eastward , with devious course , among the Wind-river Mountains ,</l>
        <l n="1085">Through the Sweet-water Valley precipitate leaps the Nebraska ;</l>
        <l n="1086">And to the south , from Fontaine-qui-bout and the Spanish sierras ,</l>
        <l n="1087">Fretted with sands and rocks , and swept by the wind of the desert ,</l>
        <l n="1088">Numberless torrents , with ceaseless sound , descend to the ocean ,</l>
        <l n="1089">Like the great chords of a harp , in loud and solemn vibrations .</l>
        <l n="1090">Spreading between these streams are the wondrous , beautiful prairies ,</l>
        <l n="1091">Billowy bays of grass ever rolling in shadow and sunshine ,</l>
        <l n="1092">Bright with luxuriant clusters of roses and purple amorphas .</l>
        <l n="1093">Over them wandered the buffalo herds , and the elk and the roebuck ;</l>
        <l n="1094">Over them wandered the wolves , and herds of riderless horses ;</l>
        <l n="1095">Fires that blast and blight , and winds that are weary with travel ;</l>
        <l n="1096">Over them wander the scattered tribes of Ishmael 's children ,</l>
        <l n="1097">Staining the desert with blood ; and above their terrible war-trails</l>
        <l n="1098">Circles and sails aloft , on pinions majestic , the vulture ,</l>
        <l n="1099">Like the implacable soul of a chieftain slaughtered in battle ,</l>
        <l n="1100">By invisible stairs ascending and scaling the heavens .</l>
        <l n="1101">Here and there rise smokes from the camps of these savage marauders ;</l>
        <l n="1102">Here and there rise groves from the margins of swift-running rivers ;</l>
        <l n="1103">And the grim , taciturn bear , the anchorite monk of the desert ,</l>
        <l n="1104">Climbs down their dark ravines to dig for roots by the brook-side ,</l>
        <l n="1105">And over all is the sky , the clear and crystalline heaven ,</l>
        <l n="1106">Like the protecting hand of God inverted above them .</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="43">
        <l n="1107">Into this wonderful land , at the base of the Ozark Mountains ,</l>
        <l n="1108">Gabriel far had entered , with hunters and trappers behind him .</l>
        <l n="1109">Day after day , with their Indian guides , the maiden and Basil</l>
        <l n="1110">Followed his flying steps , and thought each day to o'ertake him .</l>
        <l n="1111">Sometimes they saw , or thought they saw , the smoke of his camp-fire</l>
        <l n="1112">Rise in the morning air from the distant plain ; but at nightfall ,</l>
        <l n="1113">When they had reached the place , they found only embers and ashes .</l>
        <l n="1114">And , though their hearts were sad at times and their bodies were weary ,</l>
        <l n="1115">Hope still guided them on , as the magic Fata Morgana</l>
        <l n="1116">Showed them her lakes of light , that retreated and vanished before them .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="44">
        <l n="1117">Once , as they sat by their evening fire , there silently entered</l>
        <l n="1118">Into the little camp an Indian woman , whose features</l>
        <l n="1119">Wore deep traces of sorrow , and patience as great as her sorrow .</l>
        <l n="1120">She was a Shawnee woman returning home to her people ,</l>
        <l n="1121">From the far-off hunting-grounds of the cruel Camanches ,</l>
        <l n="1122">Where her Canadian husband , a Coureur-des-Bois , had been murdered .</l>
        <l n="1123">Touched were their hearts at her story , and warmest and friendliest welcome</l>
        <l n="1124">Gave they , with words of cheer , and she sat and feasted among them</l>
        <l n="1125">On the buffalo-meat and the venison cooked on the embers .</l>
        <l n="1126">But when their meal was done , and Basil and all his companions ,</l>
        <l n="1127">Worn with the long day 's march and the chase of the deer and the bison ,</l>
        <l n="1128">Stretched themselves on the ground , and slept where the quivering fire-light</l>
        <l n="1129">Flashed on their swarthy cheeks , and their forms wrapped up in their blankets</l>
        <l n="1130">Then at the door of Evangeline 's tent she sat and repeated</l>
        <l n="1131">Slowly , with soft , low voice , and the charm of her Indian accent ,</l>
        <l n="1132">All the tale of her love , with its pleasures , and pains , and reverses .</l>
        <l n="1133">Much Evangeline wept at the tale , and to know that another</l>
        <l n="1134">Hapless heart like her own had loved and had been disappointed .</l>
        <l n="1135">Moved to the depths of her soul by pity and woman 's compassion ,</l>
        <l n="1136">Yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had suffered was near her ,</l>
        <l n="1137">She in turn related her love and all its disasters .</l>
        <l n="1138">Mute with wonder the Shawnee sat , and when she had ended</l>
        <l n="1139">Still was mute ; but at length , as if a mysterious horror</l>
        <l n="1140">Passed through her brain , she spake , and repeated the tale of the Mowis ;</l>
        <l n="1141">Mowis , the bridegroom of snow , who won and wedded a maiden ,</l>
        <l n="1142">But , when the morning came , arose and passed from the wigwam ,</l>
        <l n="1143">Fading and melting away and dissolving into the sunshine ,</l>
        <l n="1144">Till she beheld him no more , though she followed far into the forest .</l>
        <l n="1145">Then , in those sweet , low tones , that seemed like a weird incantation ,</l>
        <l n="1146">Told she the tale of the fair Lilinau , who was wooed by a phantom ,</l>
        <l n="1147">That , through the pines o'er her father 's lodge , in the hush of the twilight ,</l>
        <l n="1148">Breathed like the evening wind , and whispered love to the maiden ,</l>
        <l n="1149">Till she followed his green and waving plume through the forest ,</l>
        <l n="1150">And nevermore returned , nor was seen again by her people .</l>
        <l n="1151">Silent with wonder and strange surprise , Evangeline listened</l>
        <l n="1152">To the soft flow of her magical words , till the region around her</l>
        <l n="1153">Seemed like enchanted ground , and her swarthy guest the enchantress .</l>
        <l n="1154">Slowly over the tops of the Ozark Mountains the moon rose ,</l>
        <l n="1155">Lighting the little tent , and with a mysterious splendor</l>
        <l n="1156">Touching the sombre leaves , and embracing and filling the woodland .</l>
        <l n="1157">With a delicious sound the brook rushed by , and the branches</l>
        <l n="1158">Swayed and sighed overhead in scarcely audible whispers .</l>
        <l n="1159">Filled with the thoughts of love was Evangeline 's heart , but a secret ,</l>
        <l n="1160">Subtile sense crept in of pain and indefinite terror ,</l>
        <l n="1161">As the cold , poisonous snake creeps into the nest of the swallow .</l>
        <l n="1162">It was no earthly fear . A breath from the region of spirits</l>
        <l n="1163">Seemed to float in the air of night ; and she felt for a moment</l>
        <l n="1164">That , like the Indian maid , she , too , was pursuing a phantom .</l>
        <l n="1165">With this thought she slept , and the fear and the phantom had vanished .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="45">
        <l n="1166">Early upon the morrow the march was resumed ; and the Shawnee</l>
        <l n="1167">Said , as they journeyed along , “ On the western slope of these mountains</l>
        <l n="1168">Dwells in his little village the Black Robe chief of the Mission .</l>
        <l n="1169">Much he teaches the people , and tells them of Mary and Jesus ;</l>
        <l n="1170">Loud laugh their hearts with joy , and weep with pain , as they hear him . ”</l>
        <l n="1171">Then , with a sudden and secret emotion , Evangeline answered ,</l>
        <l n="1172">“ Let us go to the Mission , for there good tidings await us ! ”</l>
        <l n="1173">Thither they turned their steeds ; and behind a spur of the mountains ,</l>
        <l n="1174">Just as the sun went down , they heard a murmur of voices ,</l>
        <l n="1175">And in a meadow green and broad , by the bank of a river ,</l>
        <l n="1176">Saw the tents of the Christians , the tents of the Jesuit Mission .</l>
        <l n="1177">Under a towering oak , that stood in the midst of the village ,</l>
        <l n="1178">Knelt the Black Robe chief with his children . A crucifix fastened</l>
        <l n="1179">High on the trunk of the tree , and overshadowed by grapevines ,</l>
        <l n="1180">Looked with its agonized face on the multitude kneeling beneath it .</l>
        <l n="1181">This was their rural chapel . Aloft , through the intricate arches</l>
        <l n="1182">Of its aerial roof , arose the chant of their vespers ,</l>
        <l n="1183">Mingling its notes with the soft susurrus and sighs of the branches .</l>
        <l n="1184">Silent , with heads uncovered , the travellers , nearer approaching ,</l>
        <l n="1185">Knelt on the swarded floor , and joined in the evening devotions .</l>
        <l n="1186">But when the service was done , and the benediction had fallen</l>
        <l n="1187">Forth from the hands of the priest , like seed from the hands of the sower ,</l>
        <l n="1188">Slowly the reverend man advanced to the strangers , and bade them</l>
        <l n="1189">Welcome ; and when they replied , he smiled with benignant expression ,</l>
        <l n="1190">Hearing the homelike sounds of his mother-tongue in the forest ,</l>
        <l n="1191">And , with words of kindness , conducted them into his wigwam .</l>
        <l n="1192">There upon mats and skins they reposed , and on cakes of the maize-ear</l>
        <l n="1193">Feasted , and slaked their thirst from the water-gourd of the teacher .</l>
        <l n="1194">Soon was their story told ; and the priest with solemnity answered :—</l>
        <l n="1195">“ Not six suns have risen and set since Gabriel , seated</l>
        <l n="1196">On this mat by my side , where now the maiden reposes ,</l>
        <l n="1197">Told me this same sad tale then arose and continued his journey ! ”</l>
        <l n="1198">Soft was the voice of the priest , and he spake with an accent of kindness ;</l>
        <l n="1199">But on Evangeline 's heart fell his words as in winter the snow-flakes</l>
        <l n="1200">Fall into some lone nest from which the birds have departed .</l>
        <l n="1201">“ Far to the north he has gone , ” continued the priest ; “ but in autumn ,</l>
        <l n="1202">When the chase is done , will return again to the Mission . ”</l>
        <l n="1203">Then Evangeline said , and her voice was meek and submissive ,</l>
        <l n="1204">“ Let me remain with thee , for my soul is sad and afflicted . ”</l>
        <l n="1205">So seemed it wise and well unto all ; and betimes on the morrow ,</l>
        <l n="1206">Mounting his Mexican steed , with his Indian guides and companions .</l>
        <l n="1207">Homeward Basil returned , and Evangeline stayed at the Mission .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="46">
        <l n="1208">Slowly , slowly , slowly the days succeeded each other ,—</l>
        <l n="1209">Days and weeks and months ; and the fields of maize that were springing</l>
        <l n="1210">Green from the ground when a stranger she came , now waving above her ,</l>
        <l n="1211">Lifted their slender shafts , with leaves interlacing , and forming</l>
        <l n="1212">Cloisters for mendicant crows and granaries pillaged by squirrels .</l>
        <l n="1213">Then in the golden weather the maize was husked , and the maidens</l>
        <l n="1214">Blushed at each blood-red ear , for that betokened a lover ,</l>
        <l n="1215">But at the crooked laughed , and called it a thief in the corn-field .</l>
        <l n="1216">Even the blood-red ear to Evangeline brought not her lover .</l>
        <l n="1217">“ Patience ! ” the priest would say ; “ have faith , and thy prayer will be answered !</l>
        <l n="1218">Look at this vigorous plant that lifts its head from the meadow ,</l>
        <l n="1219">See how its leaves are turned to the north , as true as the magnet ;</l>
        <l n="1220">This is the compass-flower , that the finger of God has planted</l>
        <l n="1221">Here in the houseless wild , to direct the traveller 's journey</l>
        <l n="1222">Over the sea-like , pathless , limitless waste of the desert .</l>
        <l n="1223">Such in the soul of man is faith . The blossoms of passion ,</l>
        <l n="1224">Gay and luxuriant flowers , are brighter and fuller of fragrance ,</l>
        <l n="1225">But they beguile us , and lead us astray , and their odor is deadly .</l>
        <l n="1226">Only this humble plant can guide us here , and hereafter</l>
        <l n="1227">Crown us with asphodel flowers , that are wet with the dews of nepenthe . ”</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="47">
        <l n="1228">So came the autumn , and passed , and the winter ,— yet Gabriel came not ;</l>
        <l n="1229">Blossomed the opening spring , and the notes of the robin and bluebird</l>
        <l n="1230">Sounded sweet upon wold and in wood , yet Gabriel came not .</l>
        <l n="1231">But on the breath of the summer winds a rumor was wafted</l>
        <l n="1232">Sweeter than song of bird , or hue or odor of blossom .</l>
        <l n="1233">Far to the north and east , it said , in the Michigan forests ,</l>
        <l n="1234">Gabriel had his lodge by the banks of the Saginaw River ,</l>
        <l n="1235">And , with returning guides , that sought the lakes of St. Lawrence ,</l>
        <l n="1236">Saying a sad farewell , Evangeline went from the Mission .</l>
        <l n="1237">When over weary ways , by long and perilous marches ,</l>
        <l n="1238">She had attained at length the depths of the Michigan forests ,</l>
        <l n="1239">Found she the hunter 's lodge deserted and fallen to ruin !</l>

        <l n="1243">Now in the noisy camps and the battle-fields of the army ,</l>

        <l n="1245">Like a phantom she came , and passed away unremembered .</l>
        <l n="1246">Fair was she and young , when in hope began the long journey ;</l>
        <l n="1247">Faded was she and old , when in disappointment it ended .</l>
        <l n="1248">Each succeeding year stole something away from her beauty ,</l>
        <l n="1249">Leaving behind it , broader and deeper , the gloom and the shadow .</l>
        <l n="1250">Then there appeared and spread faint streaks of gray o'er her forehead ,</l>
        <l n="1251">Dawn of another life , that broke o'er her earthy horizon ,</l>
        <l n="1252">As in the eastern sky the first faint streaks of the morning .</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="49">
        <l n="1253">In that delightful land which is washed by the Delaware 's waters ,</l>
        <l n="1254">Guarding in sylvan shades the name of Penn the apostle ,</l>
        <l n="1255">Stands on the banks of its beautiful stream the city he founded .</l>
        <l n="1256">There all the air is balm , and the peach is the emblem of beauty ,</l>
        <l n="1257">And the streets still re-echo the names of the trees of the forest ,</l>
        <l n="1258">As if they fain would appease the Dryads whose haunts they molested .</l>
        <l n="1259">There from the troubled sea had Evangeline landed , an exile ,</l>
        <l n="1260">Finding among the children of Penn a home and a country .</l>
        <l n="1261">There old Rene Leblanc had died ; and when he departed ,</l>
        <l n="1262">Saw at his side only one of all his hundred descendants .</l>
        <l n="1263">Something at least there was in the friendly streets of the city ,</l>
        <l n="1264">Something that spake to her heart , and made her no longer a stranger ;</l>
        <l n="1265">And her ear was pleased with the Thee and Thou of the Quakers ,</l>
        <l n="1266">For it recalled the past , the old Acadian country ,</l>
        <l n="1267">Where all men were equal , and all were brothers and sisters .</l>
        <l n="1268">So , when the fruitless search , the disappointed endeavor ,</l>
        <l n="1269">Ended , to recommence no more upon earth , uncomplaining ,</l>
        <l n="1270">Thither , as leaves to the light , were turned her thoughts and her footsteps .</l>
        <l n="1271">As from a mountain 's top the rainy mists of the morning</l>
        <l n="1272">Roll away , and afar we behold the landscape below us ,</l>
        <l n="1273">Sun-illumined , with shining rivers and cities and hamlets ,</l>
        <l n="1274">So fell the mists from her mind , and she saw the world far below her ,</l>
        <l n="1275">Dark no longer , but all illumined with love ; and the pathway</l>
        <l n="1276">Which she had climbed so far , lying smooth and fair in the distance .</l>
        <l n="1277">Gabriel was not forgotten . Within her heart was his image ,</l>
        <l n="1278">Clothed in the beauty of love and youth , as last she beheld him ,</l>
        <l n="1279">Only more beautiful made by his deathlike silence and absence .</l>
        <l n="1280">Into her thoughts of him time entered not , for it was not .</l>
        <l n="1281">Over him years had no power ; he was not changed , but transfigured ;</l>
        <l n="1282">He had become to her heart as one who is dead , and not absent ;</l>
        <l n="1283">Patience and abnegation of self , and devotion to others ,</l>
        <l n="1284">This was the lesson a life of trial and sorrow had taught her .</l>
        <l n="1285">So was her love diffused , but , like to some odorous spices ,</l>
        <l n="1286">Suffered no waste nor loss , though filling the air with aroma .</l>
        <l n="1287">Other hope had she none , nor wish in life , but to follow</l>
        <l n="1288">Meekly , with reverent steps , the sacred feet of her Saviour .</l>
        <l n="1289">Thus many years she lived as a Sister of Mercy ; frequenting</l>
        <l n="1290">Lonely and wretched roofs in the crowded lanes of the city ,</l>
        <l n="1291">Where distress and want concealed themselves from the sunlight ,</l>
        <l n="1292">Where disease and sorrow in garrets languished neglected .</l>
        <l n="1293">Night after night , when the world was asleep , as the watchman repeated</l>
        <l n="1294">Loud , through the gusty streets , that all was well in the city ,</l>
        <l n="1295">High at some lonely window he saw the light of her taper .</l>
        <l n="1296">Day after day , in the gray of the dawn , as slow through the suburbs</l>
        <l n="1297">Plodded the German farmer , with flowers and fruits for the market ,</l>
        <l n="1298">Met he that meek , pale face , returning home from its watchings .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="50">
        <l n="1299">Then it came to pass that a pestilence fell on the city ,</l>
        <l n="1300">Presaged by wondrous signs , and mostly by flocks of wild pigeons ,</l>
        <l n="1301">Darkening the sun in their flight , with naught in their craws but an acorn .</l>
        <l n="1302">And , as the tides of the sea arise in the month of September ,</l>
        <l n="1303">Flooding some silver stream , till it spreads to a lake in the meadow ,</l>
        <l n="1304">So death flooded life , and , o'erflowing its natural margin ,</l>
        <l n="1305">Spread to a brackish lake , the silver stream of existence .</l>
        <l n="1306">Wealth had no power to bribe , nor beauty to charm , the oppressor ;</l>
        <l n="1307">But all perished alike beneath the scourge of his anger ;—</l>
        <l n="1308">Only , alas ! the poor , who had neither friends nor attendants ,</l>
        <l n="1309">Crept away to die in the almshouse , home of the homeless .</l>
        <l n="1310">Then in the suburbs it stood , in the midst of meadows and woodlands ;</l>
        <l n="1311">Now the city surrounds it ; but still , with its gateway and wicket</l>
        <l n="1312">Meek , in the midst of splendor , its humble walls seem to echo</l>
        <l n="1313">Softly the words of the Lord :— “ The poor ye always have with you . ”</l>
        <l n="1314">Thither , by night and by day , came the Sister of Mercy . The dying</l>
        <l n="1315">Looked up into her face , and thought , indeed , to behold there</l>
        <l n="1316">Gleams of celestial light encircle her forehead with splendor ,</l>
        <l n="1317">Such as the artist paints o'er the brows of saints and apostles ,</l>
        <l n="1318">Or such as hangs by night o'er a city seen at a distance .</l>
        <l n="1319">Unto their eyes it seemed the lamps of the city celestial ,</l>
        <l n="1320">Into whose shining gates erelong their spirits would enter .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="51">
        <l n="1321">Thus , on a Sabbath morn , through the streets , deserted and silent ,</l>
        <l n="1322">Wending her quiet way , she entered the door of the almshouse .</l>
        <l n="1323">Sweet on the summer air was the odor of flowers in the garden ;</l>
        <l n="1324">And she paused on her way to gather the fairest among them ,</l>
        <l n="1325">That the dying once more might rejoice in their fragrance and beauty .</l>
        <l n="1326">Then , as she mounted the stairs to the corridors , cooled by the east-wind ,</l>
        <l n="1327">Distant and soft on her ear fell the chimes from the belfry of Christ Church ,</l>
        <l n="1328">While , intermingled with these , across the meadows were wafted</l>
        <l n="1329">Sounds of psalms , that were sung by the Swedes in their church at Wicaco .</l>
        <l n="1330">Soft as descending wings fell the calm of the hour on her spirit ;</l>
        <l n="1331">Something within her said , “ At length thy trials are ended ” ;</l>
        <l n="1332">And , with light in her looks , she entered the chambers of sickness .</l>
        <l n="1333">Noiselessly moved about the assiduous , careful attendants ,</l>
        <l n="1334">Moistening the feverish lip , and the aching brow , and in silence</l>
        <l n="1335">Closing the sightless eyes of the dead , and concealing their faces ,</l>
        <l n="1336">Where on their pallets they lay , like drifts of snow by the roadside .</l>
        <l n="1337">Many a languid head , upraised as Evangeline entered ,</l>
        <l n="1338">Turned on its pillow of pain to gaze while she passed , for her presence</l>
        <l n="1339">Fell on their hearts like a ray of the sun on the walls of a prison .</l>
        <l n="1340">And , as she looked around , she saw how Death , the consoler ,</l>
        <l n="1341">Laying his hand upon many a heart , had healed it forever .</l>
        <l n="1342">Many familiar forms had disappeared in the night time ;</l>
        <l n="1343">Vacant their places were , or filled already by strangers .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="52">
        <l n="1344">Suddenly , as if arrested by fear or a feeling of wonder ,</l>
        <l n="1345">Still she stood , with her colorless lips apart , while a shudder</l>
        <l n="1346">Ran through her frame , and , forgotten , the flowerets dropped from her fingers ,</l>
        <l n="1347">And from her eyes and cheeks the light and bloom of the morning .</l>
        <l n="1348">Then there escaped from her lips a cry of such terrible anguish ,</l>
        <l n="1349">That the dying heard it , and started up from their pillows .</l>
        <l n="1350">On the pallet before her was stretched the form of an old man .</l>
        <l n="1351">Long , and thin , and gray were the locks that shaded his temples ;</l>
        <l n="1352">But , as he lay in the in morning light , his face for a moment</l>
        <l n="1353">Seemed to assume once more the forms of its earlier manhood ;</l>
        <l n="1354">So are wont to be changed the faces of those who are dying .</l>
        <l n="1355">Hot and red on his lips still burned the flush of the fever ,</l>
        <l n="1356">As if life , like the Hebrew , with blood had besprinkled its portals ,</l>
        <l n="1357">That the Angel of Death might see the sign , and pass over .</l>
        <l n="1358">Motionless , senseless , dying , he lay , and his spirit exhausted</l>
        <l n="1359">Seemed to be sinking down through infinite depths in the darkness ,</l>
        <l n="1360">Darkness of slumber and death , forever sinking and sinking .</l>
        <l n="1361">Then through those realms of shade , in multiplied reverberations ,</l>
        <l n="1362">Heard he that cry of pain , and through the hush that succeeded</l>
        <l n="1363">Whispered a gentle voice , in accents tender and saint-like ,</l>
        <l n="1364">“ Gabriel ! O my beloved ! ” and died away into silence .</l>
        <l n="1365">Then he beheld , in a dream , once more the home of his childhood ;</l>
        <l n="1366">Green Acadian meadows , with sylvan rivers among them ,</l>
        <l n="1367">Village , and mountain , and woodlands ; and , walking under their shadow ,</l>
        <l n="1368">As in the days of her youth , Evangeline rose in his vision .</l>
        <l n="1369">Tears came into his eyes ; and as slowly he lifted his eyelids ,</l>
        <l n="1370">Vanished the vision away , but Evangeline knelt by his bedside .</l>
        <l n="1371">Vainly he strove to whisper her name , for the accents unuttered</l>
        <l n="1372">Died on his lips , and their motion revealed what his tongue would have spoken .</l>
        <l n="1373">Vainly he strove to rise ; and Evangeline , kneeling beside him ,</l>
        <l n="1374">Kissed his dying lips , and laid his head on her bosom .</l>
        <l n="1375">Sweet was the light of his eyes ; but it suddenly sank into darkness ,</l>
        <l n="1376">As when a lamp is blown out by a gust of wind at a casement .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="53">
        <l n="1377">All was ended now , the hope , and the fear , and the sorrow ,</l>
        <l n="1378">All the aching of heart , the restless , unsatisfied longing ,</l>
        <l n="1379">All the dull , deep pain , and constant anguish of patience !</l>
        <l n="1380">And , as she pressed once more the lifeless head to her bosom ,</l>
        <l n="1381">Meekly she bowed her own , and murmured , “ Father , I thank thee ! ”</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="54">
        <l n="1382">Still stands the forest primeval ; but far away from its shadow ,</l>
        <l n="1383">Side by side , in their nameless graves , the lovers are sleeping .</l>
        <l n="1384">Under the humble walls of the little Catholic churchyard ,</l>
        <l n="1385">In the heart of the city , they lie , unknown and unnoticed .</l>
        <l n="1386">Daily the tides of life go ebbing and flowing beside them ,</l>
        <l n="1387">Thousands of throbbing hearts , where theirs are at rest and forever ,</l>
        <l n="1388">Thousands of aching brains , where theirs no longer are busy ,</l>
        <l n="1389">Thousands of toiling hands , where theirs have ceased from their labors ,</l>
        <l n="1390">Thousands of weary feet , where theirs have completed their journey !</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="55">
        <l n="1391">Still stands the forest primeval ; but under the shade of its branches</l>
        <l n="1392">Dwells another race , with other customs and language .</l>
        <l n="1393">Only along the shore of the mournful and misty Atlantic</l>
        <l n="1394">Linger a few Acadian peasants , whose fathers from exile</l>
        <l n="1395">Wandered back to their native land to die in its bosom .</l>
        <l n="1396">In the fisherman 's cot the wheel and the loom are still busy ;</l>
        <l n="1397">Maidens still wear their Norman caps and their kirtles of homespun ,</l>
        <l n="1398">And by the evening fire repeat Evangeline 's story ,</l>
        <l n="1399">While from its rocky caverns the deep-voiced , neighboring ocean</l>
        <l n="1400">Speaks , and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest .</l>

And evermore beside him on his way The unseen Christ shall move , That he may lean upon his arm and say , “ Dost thou , dear Lord , approve ? ” Beside him at the marriage feast shall be , To make the scene more fair ; Beside him in the dark Gethsemane Of pain and midnight prayer . O holy trust ! O endless sense of rest ! Like the beloved John To lay his head upon the Saviour 's breast , And thus to journey on !

      <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
      <p>Should you ask me , whence these stories ? Whence these legends and traditions , With the odors of the forest With the dew and damp of meadows , With the curling smoke of wigwams , With the rushing of great rivers , With their frequent repetitions , And their wild reverberations As of thunder in the mountains ? I should answer , I should tell you , “ From the forests and the prairies , From the great lakes of the Northland , From the land of the Ojibways , From the land of the Dacotahs , From the mountains , moors , and fen-lands Where the heron , the Shuh-shuh-gah , Feeds among the reeds and rushes . I repeat them as I heard them From the lips of Nawadaha , The musician , the sweet singer . ” Should you ask where Nawadaha Found these songs so wild and wayward , Found these legends and traditions , I should answer , I should tell you , “ In the bird'shYpppHeNnests of the forest , In the lodges of the beaver , In the hoof-prints of the bison , In the eyry of the eagle ! “ All the wild-fowl sang them to him , In the moorlands and the fen-lands , In the melancholy marshes ; Chetowaik , the plover , sang them , Mahng , the loon , the wild-goose , Wawa , The blue heron , the Shuh-shuh-gah , And the grouse , the Mushkodasa ! ” If still further you should ask me , Saying , “ Who was Nawadaha ? Tell us of this Nawadaha , ” I should answer your inquiries Straightway in such words as follow . “ In the vale of Tawasentha , In the green and silent valley , By the pleasant water-courses , Dwelt the singer Nawadaha . Round about the Indian village Spread the meadows and the corn-fields , And beyond them stood the forest , Stood the groves of singing pine-trees , Green in Summer , white in Winter , Ever sighing , ever singing . “ And the pleasant water-courses , You could trace them through the valley , By the rushing in the Spring-time , By the alders in the Summer , By the white fog in the Autumn , By the black line in the Winter ; And beside them dwelt the singer , In the vale of Tawasentha , In the green and silent valley . “ There he sang of Hiawatha , Sang the Song of Hiawatha , Sang his wondrous birth and being , How he prayed and how he fasted , How he lived , and toiled , and suffered , That the tribes of men might prosper , That he might advance his people ! ” Ye who love the haunts of Nature , Love the sunshine of the meadow , Love the shadow of the forest , Love the wind among the branches , And the rain-shower and the snow-storm , And the rushing of great rivers Through their palisades of pine-trees , And the thunder in the mountains , Whose innumerable echoes Flap like eagles in their eyries ;— Listen to these wild traditions , To this Song of Hiawatha ! Ye who love a nation 's legends , Love the ballads of a people , That like voices from afar off Call to us to pause and listen , Speak in tones so plain and childlike , Scarcely can the ear distinguish Whether they are sung or spoken ;— Listen to this Indian Legend , To this Song of Hiawatha ! Ye whose hearts are fresh and simple , Who have faith in God and Nature , Who believe that in all ages Every human heart is human , That in even savage bosoms There are longings , yearnings , strivings For the good they comprehend not , That the feeble hands and helpless , Groping blindly in the darkness , Touch God 's right hand in that darkness And are lifted up and strengthened ;— Listen to this simple story , To this Song of Hiawatha ! Ye , who sometimes , in your rambles Through the green lanes of the country , Where the tangled barberry-bushes Hang their tufts of crimson berries Over stone walls gray with mosses , Pause by some neglected graveyard , For a while to muse , and ponder On a half-effaced inscription , Written with little skill of song-craft , Homely phrases , but each letter Full of hope and yet of heart-break , Full of all the tender pathos Of the Here and the Hereafter ;— Stay and read this rude inscription , Read this Song of Hiawatha !</p>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">On the Mountains of the Prairie ,</l>
       <l n="2">On the great Red Pipe-stone Quarry ,</l>
       <l n="3">Gitche Manito , the mighty ,</l>
       <l n="4">He the Master of Life , descending ,</l>
       <l n="5">On the red crags of the quarry</l>
       <l n="6">Stood erect , and called the nations ,</l>
       <l n="7">Called the tribes of men together .</l>
       <l n="8">From his footprints flowed a river ,</l>
       <l n="9">Leaped into the light of morning ,</l>
       <l n="10">O'er the precipice plunging downward</l>
       <l n="11">Gleamed like Ishkoodah , the comet .</l>
       <l n="12">And the Spirit , stooping earthward ,</l>
       <l n="13">With his finger on the meadow</l>
       <l n="14">Traced a winding pathway for it ,</l>
       <l n="15">Saying to it , “ Run in this way ! ”</l>
       <l n="16">From the red stone of the quarry</l>
       <l n="17">With his hand he broke a fragment ,</l>
       <l n="18">Moulded it into a pipe-head ,</l>
       <l n="19">Shaped and fashioned it with figures ;</l>
       <l n="20">From the margin of the river</l>
       <l n="21">Took a long reed for a pipe-stem ,</l>
       <l n="22">With its dark green leaves upon it ;</l>
       <l n="23">Filled the pipe with bark of willow ,</l>
       <l n="24">With the bark of the red willow ;</l>
       <l n="25">Breathed upon the neighboring forest ,</l>
       <l n="26">Made its great boughs chafe together ,</l>
       <l n="27">Till in flame they burst and kindled ;</l>
       <l n="28">And erect upon the mountains ,</l>
       <l n="29">Gitche Manito , the mighty ,</l>
       <l n="30">Smoked the calumet , the Peace-Pipe ,</l>
       <l n="31">As a signal to the nations .</l>
       <l n="32">And the smoke rose slowly , slowly ,</l>
       <l n="33">Through the tranquil air of morning ,</l>
       <l n="34">First a single line of darkness ,</l>
       <l n="35">Then a denser , bluer vapor ,</l>
       <l n="36">Then a snow-white cloud unfolding ,</l>
       <l n="37">Like the tree-tops of the forest ,</l>
       <l n="38">Ever rising , rising , rising ,</l>
       <l n="39">Till it touched the top of heaven ,</l>
       <l n="40">Till it broke against the heaven ,</l>
       <l n="41">And rolled outward all around it .</l>
       <l n="42">From the Vale of Tawasentha ,</l>
       <l n="43">From the Valley of Wyoming ,</l>
       <l n="44">From the groves of Tuscaloosa ,</l>
       <l n="45">From the far-off Rocky Mountains ,</l>
       <l n="46">From the Northern lakes and rivers</l>
       <l n="47">All the tribes beheld the signal ,</l>
       <l n="48">Saw the distant smoke ascending ,</l>
       <l n="49">The Pukwana of the Peace-Pipe .</l>
       <l n="50">And the Prophets of the nations</l>
       <l n="51">Said : “ Behold it , the Pukwana !</l>
       <l n="52">By the signal of the Peace-Pipe ,</l>
       <l n="53">Bending like a wand of willow ,</l>
       <l n="54">Waving like a hand that beckons ,</l>
       <l n="55">Gitche Manito , the mighty ,</l>
       <l n="56">Calls the tribes of men together ,</l>
       <l n="57">Calls the warriors to his council ! ”</l>
       <l n="58">Down the rivers , o'er the prairies ,</l>
       <l n="59">Came the warriors of the nations ,</l>

       <l n="68">To the Mountains of the Prairie ,</l>
       <l n="69">To the great Red Pipe-stone Quarry .</l>

       <l n="71">With their weapons and their war-gear ,</l>
       <l n="72">Painted like the leaves of Autumn ,</l>
       <l n="73">Painted like the sky of morning ,</l>
       <l n="74">Wildly glaring at each other ;</l>
       <l n="75">In their faces stern defiance ,</l>
       <l n="76">In their hearts the feuds of ages ,</l>

       <l n="81">Looked upon them with compassion ,</l>
       <l n="82">With paternal love and pity ;</l>
       <l n="83">Looked upon their wrath and wrangling</l>
       <l n="84">But as quarrels among children ,</l>
       <l n="85">But as feuds and fights of children !</l>
       <l n="86">Over them he stretched his right hand ,</l>

       <l n="88">To allay their thirst and fever ,</l>
       <l n="89">By the shadow of his right hand ;</l>

       <l n="92">Falling into deep abysses ,</l>
       <l n="93">Warning , chiding , spake in this wise :—</l>

       <l n="95">Listen to the words of wisdom ,</l>
       <l n="96">Listen to the words of warning ,</l>

       <l n="98">From the Master of Life , who made you !</l>
       <l n="99">“ I have given you lands to hunt in ,</l>

       <l n="110">Weary of your prayers for vengeance ,</l>
       <l n="111">Of your wranglings and dissensions ;</l>

       <l n="115">And as brothers live together .</l>
       <l n="116">“ I will send a Prophet to you ,</l>
       <l n="117">A Deliverer of the nations ,</l>
       <l n="118">Who shall guide you and shall teach you ,</l>
       <l n="119">Who shall toil and suffer with you .</l>
       <l n="120">If you listen to his counsels ,</l>
       <l n="121">You will multiply and prosper ;</l>
       <l n="122">If his warnings pass unheeded ,</l>
       <l n="123">You will fade away and perish !</l>
       <l n="124">“ Bathe now in the stream before you ,</l>
       <l n="125">Wash the war-paint from your faces ,</l>
       <l n="126">Wash the blood-stains from your fingers ,</l>
       <l n="127">Bury your war-clubs and your weapons ,</l>
       <l n="128">Break the red stone from this quarry ,</l>
       <l n="129">Mould and make it into Peace-Pipes ,</l>
       <l n="130">Take the reeds that grow beside you ,</l>
       <l n="131">Deck them with your brightest feathers ,</l>
       <l n="132">Smoke the calumet together ,</l>
       <l n="133">And as brothers live henceforward ! ”</l>
       <l n="134">Then upon the ground the warriors</l>
       <l n="135">Threw their cloaks and shirts of deer-skin ,</l>
       <l n="136">Threw their weapons and their war-gear ,</l>
       <l n="137">Leaped into the rushing river ,</l>
       <l n="138">Washed the war-paint from their faces .</l>
       <l n="139">Clear above them flowed the water ,</l>

       <l n="142">Dark below them flowed the water ,</l>
       <l n="143">Soiled and stained with streaks of crimson ,</l>
       <l n="144">As if blood were mingled with it !</l>
       <l n="145">From the river came the warriors ,</l>
       <l n="146">Clean and washed from all their war-paint ;</l>

        <l n="213">Now you find that we are strongest ,</l>
        <l n="214">You go sneaking in the forest ,</l>
        <l n="215">You go hiding in the mountains !</l>
        <l n="216">Had you conquered me in battle</l>
        <l n="217">Not a groan would I have uttered ;</l>
        <l n="218">But you , Bear ! sit here and whimper ,</l>
        <l n="219">And disgrace your tribe by crying ,</l>
        <l n="220">Like a wretched Shaugodaya ,</l>
        <l n="221">Like a cowardly old woman ! ”</l>
        <l n="222">Then again he raised his war-club ,</l>
        <l n="223">Smote again the Mishe-Mokwa</l>
        <l n="224">In the middle of his forehead ,</l>
        <l n="225">Broke his skull , as ice is broken</l>
        <l n="226">When one goes to fish in Winter .</l>
        <l n="227">Thus was slain the Mishe-Mokwa ,</l>
        <l n="228">He the Great Bear of the mountains ,</l>
        <l n="229">He the terror of the nations .</l>
        <l n="230">“ Honor be to Mudjekeewis ! ”</l>
        <l n="231">With a shout exclaimed the people ,</l>
        <l n="232">“ Honor be to Mudjekeewis !</l>
        <l n="233">Henceforth he shall be the West-Wind ,</l>
        <l n="234">And hereafter and forever</l>
        <l n="235">Shall he hold supreme dominion</l>
        <l n="236">Over all the winds of heaven .</l>
        <l n="237">Call him no more Mudjekeewis ,</l>
        <l n="238">Call him Kabeyun , the West-Wind ! ”</l>
        <l n="239">Thus was Mudjekeewis chosen</l>
        <l n="240">Father of the Winds of Heaven .</l>
        <l n="241">For himself he kept the West-Wind ,</l>
        <l n="242">Gave the others to his children ;</l>
        <l n="243">Unto Wabun gave the East-Wind ,</l>
        <l n="244">Gave the South to Shawondasee ,</l>
        <l n="245">And the North-Wind , wild and cruel ,</l>
        <l n="246">To the fierce Kabibonokka .</l>
        <l n="247">Young and beautiful was Wabun ;</l>
        <l n="248">He it was who brought the morning ,</l>
        <l n="249">He it was whose silver arrows</l>
        <l n="250">Chased the dark o'er hill and valley ;</l>
        <l n="251">He it was whose cheeks were painted</l>
        <l n="252">With the brightest streaks of crimson ,</l>
        <l n="253">And whose voice awoke the village ,</l>
        <l n="254">Called the deer , and called the hunter .</l>
        <l n="255">Lonely in the sky was Wabun ;</l>
        <l n="256">Though the birds sang gayly to him ,</l>
        <l n="257">Though the wild-flowers of the meadow</l>
        <l n="258">Filled the air with odors for him ,</l>
        <l n="259">Though the forests and the rivers</l>
        <l n="260">Sang and shouted at his coming ,</l>
        <l n="261">Still his heart was sad within him ,</l>
        <l n="262">For he was alone in heaven .</l>
        <l n="263">But one morning , gazing earthward ,</l>
        <l n="264">While the village still was sleeping ,</l>
        <l n="265">And the fog lay on the river ,</l>
        <l n="266">Like a ghost , that goes at sunrise ,</l>
        <l n="267">He beheld a maiden walking</l>
        <l n="268">All alone upon a meadow ,</l>
        <l n="269">Gathering water-flags and rushes</l>
        <l n="270">By a river in the meadow .</l>
        <l n="271">Every morning , gazing earthward ,</l>
        <l n="272">Still the first thing he beheld there</l>
        <l n="273">Was her blue eyes looking at him ,</l>
        <l n="274">Two blue lakes among the rushes .</l>
        <l n="275">And he loved the lonely maiden ,</l>
        <l n="276">Who thus waited for his coming ;</l>
        <l n="277">For they both were solitary ,</l>
        <l n="278">She on earth and he in heaven .</l>
        <l n="279">And he wooed her with caresses ,</l>
        <l n="280">Wooed her with his smile of sunshine ,</l>
        <l n="281">With his flattering words he wooed her ,</l>
        <l n="282">With his sighing and his singing ,</l>
        <l n="283">Gentlest whispers in the branches ,</l>
        <l n="284">Softest music , sweetest odors ,</l>
        <l n="285">Till he drew her to his bosom ,</l>
        <l n="286">Folded in his robes of crimson ,</l>
        <l n="287">Till into a star he changed her ,</l>
        <l n="288">Trembling still upon his bosom ;</l>
        <l n="289">And forever in the heavens</l>
        <l n="290">They are seen together walking ,</l>
        <l n="291">Wabun and the Wabun-Annung ,</l>
        <l n="292">Wabun and the Star of Morning .</l>
        <l n="293">But the fierce Kabibonokka</l>
        <l n="294">Had his dwelling among icebergs ,</l>
        <l n="295">In the everlasting snow-drifts ,</l>
        <l n="296">In the kingdom of Wabasso ,</l>
        <l n="297">In the land of the White Rabbit .</l>
        <l n="298">He it was whose hand in Autumn</l>
        <l n="299">Painted all the trees with scarlet ,</l>
        <l n="300">Stained the leaves with red and yellow ;</l>
        <l n="301">He it was who sent the snow-flake ,</l>
        <l n="302">Sifting , hissing through the forest ,</l>
        <l n="303">Froze the ponds , the lakes , the rivers ,</l>
        <l n="304">Drove the loon and sea-gull southward ,</l>
        <l n="305">Drove the cormorant and curlew</l>
        <l n="306">To their nests of sedge and sea-tang</l>
        <l n="307">In the realms of Shawondasee .</l>
        <l n="308">Once the fierce Kabibonokka</l>
        <l n="309">Issued from his lodge of snow-drifts</l>
        <l n="310">From his home among the icebergs ,</l>
        <l n="311">And his hair , with snow besprinkled ,</l>
        <l n="312">Streamed behind him like a river ,</l>
        <l n="313">Like a black and wintry river ,</l>
        <l n="314">As he howled and hurried southward ,</l>
        <l n="315">Over frozen lakes and moorlands .</l>
        <l n="316">There among the reeds and rushes</l>
        <l n="317">Found he Shingebis , the diver ,</l>
        <l n="318">Trailing strings of fish behind him ,</l>
        <l n="319">O'er the frozen fens and moorlands ,</l>
        <l n="320">Lingering still among the moorlands ,</l>
        <l n="321">Though his tribe had long departed</l>
        <l n="322">To the land of Shawondasee .</l>
        <l n="323">Cried the fierce Kabibonokka ,</l>
        <l n="324">“ Who is this that dares to brave me ?</l>
        <l n="325">Dares to stay in my dominions ,</l>
        <l n="326">When the Wawa has departed ,</l>
        <l n="327">When the wild-goose has gone southward ,</l>
        <l n="328">And the heron , the Shuh-shuh-gah ,</l>
        <l n="329">Long ago departed southward ?</l>
        <l n="330">I will go into his wigwam ,</l>
        <l n="331">I will put his smouldering fire out ! ”</l>
        <l n="332">And at night Kabibonokka ,</l>
        <l n="333">To the lodge came wild and wailing ,</l>
        <l n="334">Heaped the snow in drifts about it ,</l>
        <l n="335">Shouted down into the smoke-flue ,</l>
        <l n="336">Shook the lodge-poles in his fury ,</l>
        <l n="337">Flapped the curtain of the door-way .</l>
        <l n="338">Shingebis , the diver , feared not ,</l>
        <l n="339">Shingebis , the diver , cared not ;</l>
        <l n="340">Four great logs had he for firewood ,</l>
        <l n="341">One for each moon of the winter ,</l>
        <l n="342">And for food the fishes served him .</l>
        <l n="343">By his blazing fire he sat there ,</l>
        <l n="344">Warm and merry , eating , laughing ,</l>
        <l n="345">Singing , “ O Kabibonokka ,</l>
        <l n="346">You are but my fellow-mortal ! ”</l>
        <l n="347">Then Kabibonokka entered ,</l>
        <l n="348">And though Shingebis , the diver ,</l>
        <l n="349">Felt his presence by the coldness ,</l>
        <l n="350">Felt his icy breath upon him ,</l>
        <l n="351">Still he did not cease his singing ,</l>
        <l n="352">Still he did not leave his laughing ,</l>
        <l n="353">Only turned the log a little ,</l>
        <l n="354">Only made the fire burn brighter ,</l>
        <l n="355">Made the sparks fly up the smoke-flue .</l>
        <l n="356">From Kabibonokka 's forehead ,</l>
        <l n="357">From his snow-besprinkled tresses ,</l>
        <l n="358">Drops of sweat fell fast and heavy ,</l>
        <l n="359">Making dints upon the ashes ,</l>
        <l n="360">As along the eaves of lodges ,</l>
        <l n="361">As from drooping boughs of hemlock ,</l>
        <l n="362">Drips the melting snow in spring-time ,</l>
        <l n="363">Making hollows in the snow-drifts .</l>
        <l n="364">Till at last he rose defeated ,</l>
        <l n="365">Could not bear the heat and laughter ,</l>
        <l n="366">Could not bear the merry singing ,</l>
        <l n="367">But rushed headlong through the door-way ,</l>
        <l n="368">Stamped upon the crusted snow-drifts ,</l>
        <l n="369">Stamped upon the lakes and rivers ,</l>
        <l n="370">Made the snow upon them harder ,</l>
        <l n="371">Made the ice upon them thicker ,</l>
        <l n="372">Challenged Shingebis , the diver ,</l>
        <l n="373">To come forth and wrestle with him ,</l>
        <l n="374">To come forth and wrestle naked</l>
        <l n="375">On the frozen fens and moorlands .</l>
        <l n="376">Forth went Shingebis , the diver ,</l>
        <l n="377">Wrestled all night with the North-Wind ,</l>
        <l n="378">Wrestled naked on the moorlands</l>
        <l n="379">With the fierce Kabibonokka ,</l>
        <l n="380">Till his panting breath grew fainter ,</l>
        <l n="381">Till his frozen grasp grew feebler ,</l>
        <l n="382">Till he reeled and staggered backward ,</l>
        <l n="383">And retreated , baffled , beaten ,</l>
        <l n="384">To the kingdom of Wabasso ,</l>
        <l n="385">To the land of the White Rabbit ,</l>
        <l n="386">Hearing still the gusty laughter ,</l>
        <l n="387">Hearing Shingebis , the diver ,</l>
        <l n="388">Singing , “ O Kabibonokka ,</l>
        <l n="389">You are but my fellow-mortal ! ”</l>
        <l n="390">Shawondasee , fat and lazy ,</l>
        <l n="391">Had his dwelling far to southward ,</l>
        <l n="392">In the drowsy , dreamy sunshine ,</l>
        <l n="393">In the never-ending Summer .</l>
        <l n="394">He it was who sent the wood-birds ,</l>
        <l n="395">Sent the robin , the Opechee ,</l>
        <l n="396">Sent the bluebird , the Owaissa ,</l>
        <l n="397">Sent the Shawshaw , sent the swallow ,</l>
        <l n="398">Sent the wild-goose , Wawa , northward ,</l>
        <l n="399">Sent the melons and tobacco ,</l>
        <l n="400">And the grapes in purple clusters .</l>
        <l n="401">From his pipe the smoke ascending</l>
        <l n="402">Filled the sky with haze and vapor ,</l>
        <l n="403">Filled the air with dreamy softness ,</l>
        <l n="404">Gave a twinkle to the water ,</l>
        <l n="405">Touched the rugged hills with smoothness ,</l>
        <l n="406">Brought the tender Indian Summer</l>
        <l n="407">To the melancholy north-land ,</l>
        <l n="408">In the dreary Moon of Snow-shoes .</l>
        <l n="409">Listless , careless Shawondasee !</l>
        <l n="410">In his life he had one shadow ,</l>
        <l n="411">In his heart one sorrow had he .</l>
        <l n="412">Once , as he was gazing northward ,</l>
        <l n="413">Far away upon a prairie</l>
        <l n="414">He beheld a maiden standing ,</l>
        <l n="415">Saw a tall and slender maiden</l>
        <l n="416">All alone upon a prairie ;</l>
        <l n="417">Brightest green were all her garments ,</l>
        <l n="418">And her hair was like the sunshine .</l>
        <l n="419">Day by day he gazed upon her ,</l>
        <l n="420">Day by day he sighed with passion ,</l>
        <l n="421">Day by day his heart within him</l>
        <l n="422">Grew more hot with love and longing</l>
        <l n="423">For the maid with yellow tresses .</l>
        <l n="424">But he was too fat and lazy</l>
        <l n="425">To bestir himself and woo her ;</l>
        <l n="426">Yes , too indolent and easy</l>
        <l n="427">To pursue her and persuade her ;</l>
        <l n="428">So he only gazed upon her ,</l>
        <l n="429">Only sat and sighed with passion</l>
        <l n="430">For the maiden of the prairie .</l>
        <l n="431">Till one morning , looking northward ,</l>
        <l n="432">He beheld her yellow tresses</l>
        <l n="433">Changed and covered o'er with whiteness ,</l>
        <l n="434">Covered as with whitest snow-flakes .</l>
        <l n="435">“ Ah ! my brother from the North-land ,</l>
        <l n="436">From the kingdom of Wabasso ,</l>
        <l n="437">From the land of the White Rabbit !</l>
        <l n="438">You have stolen the maiden from me ,</l>
        <l n="439">You have laid your hand upon her ,</l>
        <l n="440">You have wooed and won my maiden ,</l>
        <l n="441">With your stories of the North-land ! ”</l>
        <l n="442">Thus the wretched Shawondasee</l>
        <l n="443">Breathed into the air his sorrow ;</l>
        <l n="444">And the South-Wind o'er the prairie</l>
        <l n="445">Wandered warm with sighs of passion ,</l>
        <l n="446">With the sighs of Shawondasee ,</l>
        <l n="447">Till the air seemed full of snow-flakes ,</l>
        <l n="448">Full of thistle-down the prairie ,</l>
        <l n="449">And the maid with hair like sunshine</l>
        <l n="450">Vanished from his sight forever ;</l>
        <l n="451">Never more did Shawondasee</l>
        <l n="452">See the maid with yellow tresses !</l>
        <l n="453">Poor , deluded Shawondasee !</l>
        <l n="454">‘ T was no woman that you gazed at ,</l>
        <l n="455">‘ T was no maiden that you sighed for ,</l>
        <l n="456">‘ T was the prairie dandelion</l>
        <l n="457">That through all the dreamy Summer</l>
        <l n="458">You had gazed at with such longing ,</l>
        <l n="459">You had sighed for with such passion ,</l>
        <l n="460">And had puffed away forever ,</l>
        <l n="461">Blown into the air with sighing .</l>
        <l n="462">Ah ! deluded Shawondasee !</l>
        <l n="463">Thus the Four Winds were divided ;</l>
        <l n="464">Thus the sons of Mudjekeewis</l>
        <l n="465">Had their stations in the heavens ,</l>
        <l n="466">At the corners of the heavens ;</l>
        <l n="467">For himself the West-Wind only</l>
        <l n="468">Kept the mighty Mudjekeewis .</l>

      <head>HIAWATHA 'S CHILDHOOD</head>
       <l n="1">Downward through the evening twilight ,</l>
       <l n="2">In the days that are forgotten ,</l>
       <l n="3">In the unremembered ages ,</l>
       <l n="4">From the full moon fell Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="5">Fell the beautiful Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="6">She a wife , but not a mother .</l>
       <l n="7">She was sporting with her women ,</l>
       <l n="8">Swinging in a swing of grape-vines ,</l>
       <l n="9">When her rival , the rejected ,</l>
       <l n="10">Full of jealousy and hatred ,</l>
       <l n="11">Cut the leafy swing asunder ,</l>
       <l n="12">Cut in twain the twisted grape-vines ,</l>
       <l n="13">And Nokomis fell affrighted</l>
       <l n="14">Downward through the evening twilight ,</l>
       <l n="15">On the Muskoday , the meadow ,</l>
       <l n="16">On the prairie full of blossoms .</l>
       <l n="17">“ See ! a star falls ! ” said the people ;</l>
       <l n="18">“ From the sky a star is falling ! ”</l>
       <l n="19">There among the ferns and mosses ,</l>
       <l n="20">There among the prairie lilies ,</l>
       <l n="21">On the Muskoday , the meadow ,</l>
       <l n="22">In the moonlight and the starlight ,</l>
       <l n="23">Fair Nokomis bore a daughter .</l>
       <l n="24">And she called her name Wenonah ,</l>
       <l n="25">As the first-born of her daughters .</l>
       <l n="26">And the daughter of Nokomis</l>
       <l n="27">Grew up like the prairie lilies ,</l>
       <l n="28">Grew a tall and slender maiden ,</l>
       <l n="29">With the beauty of the moonlight ,</l>
       <l n="30">With the beauty of the starlight .</l>
       <l n="31">And Nokomis warned her often ,</l>
       <l n="32">Saying oft , and oft repeating ,</l>
       <l n="33">“ Oh , beware of Mudjekeewis ,</l>
       <l n="34">Of the West-Wind , Mudjekeewis ;</l>
       <l n="35">Listen not to what he tells you ;</l>
       <l n="36">Lie not down upon the meadow ,</l>
       <l n="37">Stoop not down among the lilies ,</l>
       <l n="38">Lest the West-Wind come and harm you ! ”</l>
       <l n="39">But she heeded not the warning ,</l>
       <l n="40">Heeded not those words of wisdom ,</l>
       <l n="41">And the West-Wind came at evening ,</l>
       <l n="42">Walking lightly o'er the prairie ,</l>
       <l n="43">Whispering to the leaves and blossoms ,</l>
       <l n="44">Bending low the flowers and grasses ,</l>
       <l n="45">Found the beautiful Wenonah ,</l>
       <l n="46">Lying there among the lilies ,</l>
       <l n="47">Wooed her with his words of sweetness ,</l>
       <l n="48">Wooed her with his soft caresses ,</l>
       <l n="49">Till she bore a son in sorrow ,</l>
       <l n="50">Bore a son of love and sorrow .</l>
       <l n="51">Thus was born my Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="52">Thus was born the child of wonder ;</l>
       <l n="53">But the daughter of Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="54">Hiawatha 's gentle mother ,</l>
       <l n="55">In her anguish died deserted</l>
       <l n="56">By the West-Wind , false and faithless ,</l>
       <l n="57">By the heartless Mudjekeewis .</l>
       <l n="58">For her daughter long and loudly</l>
       <l n="59">Wailed and wept the sad Nokomis ;</l>
       <l n="60">“ Oh that I were dead ! ” she murmured ,</l>
       <l n="61">“ Oh that I were dead , as thou art !</l>
       <l n="62">No more work , and no more weeping ,</l>
       <l n="63">Wahonowin ! Wahonowin ! ”</l>
       <l n="64">By the shores of Gitche Gumee ,</l>
       <l n="65">By the shining Big-Sea-Water ,</l>
       <l n="66">Stood the wigwam of Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="67">Daughter of the Moon , Nokomis .</l>
       <l n="68">Dark behind it rose the forest ,</l>
       <l n="69">Rose the black and gloomy pine-trees ,</l>
       <l n="70">Rose the firs with cones upon them ;</l>
       <l n="71">Bright before it beat the water ,</l>
       <l n="72">Beat the clear and sunny water ,</l>
       <l n="73">Beat the shining Big-Sea-Water .</l>
       <l n="74">There the wrinkled old Nokomis</l>
       <l n="75">Nursed the little Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="76">Rocked him in his linden cradle ,</l>
       <l n="77">Bedded soft in moss and rushes ,</l>
       <l n="78">Safely bound with reindeer sinews ;</l>
       <l n="79">Stilled his fretful wail by saying ,</l>
       <l n="80">“ Hush ! the Naked Bear will hear thee ! ”</l>
       <l n="81">Lulled him into slumber , singing ,</l>
       <l n="82">“ Ewa-yea ! my little owlet !</l>
       <l n="83">Who is this , that lights the wigwam ?</l>
       <l n="84">With his great eyes lights the wigwam ?</l>
       <l n="85">Ewa-yea ! my little owlet ! ”</l>
       <l n="86">Many things Nokomis taught him</l>
       <l n="87">Of the stars that shine in heaven ;</l>
       <l n="88">Showed him Ishkoodah , the comet ,</l>
       <l n="89">Ishkoodah , with fiery tresses ;</l>
       <l n="90">Showed the Death-Dance of the spirits ,</l>
       <l n="91">Warriors with their plumes and war-clubs ,</l>
       <l n="92">Flaring far away to northward</l>
       <l n="93">In the frosty nights of Winter ;</l>
       <l n="94">Showed the broad white road in heaven ,</l>
       <l n="95">Pathway of the ghosts , the shadows ,</l>
       <l n="96">Running straight across the heavens ,</l>
       <l n="97">Crowded with the ghosts , the shadows .</l>
       <l n="98">At the door on summer evenings</l>
       <l n="99">Sat the little Hiawatha ;</l>
       <l n="100">Heard the whispering of the pine-trees ,</l>
       <l n="101">Heard the lapping of the water ,</l>
       <l n="102">Sounds of music , words of wonder ;</l>
       <l n="103">‘ Minne-wawa ! ” said the Pine-trees ,</l>
       <l n="104">Mudway-aushka ! ” said the water .</l>
       <l n="105">Saw the fire-fly , Wah-wah-taysee ,</l>
       <l n="106">Flitting through the dusk of evening ,</l>
       <l n="107">With the twinkle of its candle</l>
       <l n="108">Lighting up the brakes and bushes ,</l>
       <l n="109">And he sang the song of children ,</l>
       <l n="110">Sang the song Nokomis taught him :</l>
       <l n="111">“ Wah-wah-taysee , little fire-fly ,</l>
       <l n="112">Little , flitting , white-fire insect ,</l>
       <l n="113">Little , dancing , white-fire creature ,</l>
       <l n="114">Light me with your little candle ,</l>
       <l n="115">Ere upon my bed I lay me ,</l>
       <l n="116">Ere in sleep I close my eyelids ! ”</l>
       <l n="117">Saw the moon rise from the water</l>
       <l n="118">Rippling , rounding from the water ,</l>
       <l n="119">Saw the flecks and shadows on it ,</l>
       <l n="120">Whispered , “ What is that , Nokomis ? ”</l>
       <l n="121">And the good Nokomis answered :</l>
       <l n="122">“ Once a warrior , very angry ,</l>
       <l n="123">Seized his grandmother , and threw her</l>
       <l n="124">Up into the sky at midnight ;</l>
       <l n="125">Right against the moon he threw her ;</l>
       <l n="126">‘ T is her body that you see there . ”</l>
       <l n="127">Saw the rainbow in the heaven ,</l>
       <l n="128">In the eastern sky , the rainbow ,</l>
       <l n="129">Whispered , “ What is that , Nokomis ? ”</l>
       <l n="130">And the good Nokomis answered :</l>
       <l n="131">“ ‘ T is the heaven of flowers you see there ;</l>
       <l n="132">All the wild-flowers of the forest ,</l>
       <l n="133">All the lilies of the prairie ,</l>
       <l n="134">When on earth they fade and perish ,</l>
       <l n="135">Blossom in that heaven above us . ”</l>
       <l n="136">When he heard the owls at midnight ,</l>
       <l n="137">Hooting , laughing in the forest ,</l>
       <l n="138">“ What is that ? ” he cried in terror ,</l>
       <l n="139">“ What is that , ” he said , “ Nokomis ? ”</l>
       <l n="140">And the good Nokomis answered :</l>
       <l n="141">“ That is but the owl and owlet ,</l>
       <l n="142">Talking in their native language ,</l>
       <l n="143">Talking , scolding at each other . ”</l>
       <l n="144">Then the little Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="145">Learned of every bird its language ,</l>
       <l n="146">Learned their names and all their secrets ,</l>
       <l n="147">How they built their nests in Summer ,</l>
       <l n="148">Where they hid themselves in Winter ,</l>
       <l n="149">Talked with them whene'er he met them ,</l>
       <l n="150">Called them “ Hiawatha 's Chickens . ”</l>
       <l n="151">Of all beasts he learned the language ,</l>
       <l n="152">Learned their names and all their secrets ,</l>
       <l n="153">How the beavers built their lodges ,</l>
       <l n="154">Where the squirrels hid their acorns ,</l>
       <l n="155">How the reindeer ran so swiftly ,</l>
       <l n="156">Why the rabbit was so timid ,</l>
       <l n="157">Talked with them whene'er he met them ,</l>
       <l n="158">Called them “ Hiawatha 's Brothers . ”</l>
       <l n="159">Then Iagoo , the great boaster ,</l>
       <l n="160">He the marvellous story-teller ,</l>
       <l n="161">He the traveller and the talker ,</l>
       <l n="162">He the friend of old Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="163">Made a bow for Hiawatha ;</l>
       <l n="164">From a branch of ash he made it ,</l>
       <l n="165">From an oak-bough made the arrows ,</l>
       <l n="166">Tipped with flint , and winged with feathers ,</l>
       <l n="167">And the cord he made of deer-skin .</l>
       <l n="168">Then he said to Hiawatha :</l>
       <l n="169">“ Go , my son , into the forest ,</l>
       <l n="170">Where the red deer herd together ,</l>
       <l n="171">Kill for us a famous roebuck ,</l>
       <l n="172">Kill for us a deer with antlers ! ”</l>
       <l n="173">Forth into the forest straightway</l>
       <l n="174">All alone walked Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="175">Proudly , with his bow and arrows ;</l>
       <l n="176">And the birds sang round him , o'er him ,</l>
       <l n="177">“ Do not shoot us , Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="178">Sang the robin , the Opechee ,</l>
       <l n="179">Sang the bluebird , the Owaissa ,</l>
       <l n="180">“ Do not shoot us , Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="181">Up the oak-tree , close beside him ,</l>
       <l n="182">Sprang the squirrel , Adjidaumo ,</l>
       <l n="183">In and out among the branches ,</l>
       <l n="184">Coughed and chattered from the oak-tree ,</l>
       <l n="185">Laughed , and said between his laughing ,</l>
       <l n="186">“ Do not shoot me , Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="187">And the rabbit from his pathway</l>
       <l n="188">Leaped aside , and at a distance</l>
       <l n="189">Sat erect upon his haunches ,</l>
       <l n="190">Half in fear and half in frolic ,</l>
       <l n="191">Saying to the little hunter ,</l>
       <l n="192">“ Do not shoot me , Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="193">But he heeded not , nor heard them ,</l>
       <l n="194">For his thoughts were with the red deer ;</l>
       <l n="195">On their tracks his eyes were fastened ,</l>
       <l n="196">Leading downward to the river ,</l>
       <l n="197">To the ford across the river ,</l>
       <l n="198">And as one in slumber walked he .</l>
       <l n="199">Hidden in the alder-bushes ,</l>
       <l n="200">There he waited till the deer came ,</l>
       <l n="201">Till he saw two antlers lifted ,</l>
       <l n="202">Saw two eyes look from the thicket ,</l>
       <l n="203">Saw two nostrils point to windward ,</l>
       <l n="204">And a deer came down the pathway ,</l>
       <l n="205">Flecked with leafy light and shadow .</l>
       <l n="206">And his heart within him fluttered ,</l>
       <l n="207">Trembled like the leaves above him ,</l>
       <l n="208">Like the birch-leaf palpitated ,</l>
       <l n="209">As the deer came down the pathway .</l>
       <l n="210">Then , upon one knee uprising ,</l>
       <l n="211">Hiawatha aimed an arrow ;</l>
       <l n="212">Scarce a twig moved with his motion ,</l>
       <l n="213">Scarce a leaf was stirred or rustled ,</l>
       <l n="214">But the wary roebuck started ,</l>
       <l n="215">Stamped with all his hoofs together ,</l>
       <l n="216">Listened with one foot uplifted ,</l>
       <l n="217">Leaped as if to meet the arrow ;</l>
       <l n="218">Ah ! the singing , fatal arrow ,</l>
       <l n="219">Like a wasp it buzzed and stung him !</l>
       <l n="220">Dead he lay there in the forest ,</l>
       <l n="221">By the ford across the river ;</l>
       <l n="222">Beat his timid heart no longer ,</l>
       <l n="223">But the heart of Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="224">Throbbed and shouted and exulted ,</l>
       <l n="225">As he bore the red deer homeward ,</l>
       <l n="226">And Iagoo and Nokomis</l>
       <l n="227">Hailed his coming with applauses .</l>
       <l n="228">From the red deer 's hide Nokomis</l>
       <l n="229">Made a cloak for Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="230">From the red deer 's flesh Nokomis</l>
       <l n="231">Made a banquet to his honor .</l>
       <l n="232">All the village came and feasted ,</l>
       <l n="233">All the guests praised Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="234">Called him Strong-Heart , Soan-ge-taha !</l>
       <l n="235">Called him Loon-Heart , Mahn-go-taysee !</l>

      <head>HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS</head>
       <l n="1">Out of childhood into manhood</l>
       <l n="2">Now had grown my Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="3">Skilled in all the craft of hunters ,</l>
       <l n="4">Learned in all the lore of old men ,</l>
       <l n="5">In all youthful sports and pastimes ,</l>
       <l n="6">In all manly arts and labors .</l>
       <l n="7">Swift of foot was Hiawatha ;</l>
       <l n="8">He could shoot an arrow from him ,</l>
       <l n="9">And run forward with such fleetness ,</l>
       <l n="10">That the arrow fell behind him !</l>
       <l n="11">Strong of arm was Hiawatha ;</l>
       <l n="12">He could shoot ten arrows upward ,</l>
       <l n="13">Shoot them with such strength and swiftness ,</l>
       <l n="14">That the tenth had left the bow-string</l>
       <l n="15">Ere the first to earth had fallen !</l>
       <l n="16">He had mittens , Minjekahwun ,</l>
       <l n="17">Magic mittens made of deer-skin ;</l>
       <l n="18">When upon his hands he wore them ,</l>
       <l n="19">He could smite the rocks asunder ,</l>
       <l n="20">He could grind them into powder .</l>
       <l n="21">He had moccasins enchanted ,</l>
       <l n="22">Magic moccasins of deer-skin ;</l>
       <l n="23">When he bound them round his ankles ,</l>
       <l n="24">When upon his feet he tied them ,</l>
       <l n="25">At each stride a mile he measured !</l>
       <l n="26">Much he questioned old Nokomis</l>
       <l n="27">Of his father Mudjekeewis ;</l>
       <l n="28">Learned from her the fatal secret</l>
       <l n="29">Of the beauty of his mother ,</l>
       <l n="30">Of the falsehood of his father ;</l>
       <l n="31">And his heart was hot within him ,</l>
       <l n="32">Like a living coal his heart was .</l>
       <l n="33">Then he said to old Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="34">“ I will go to Mudjekeewis ,</l>
       <l n="35">See how fares it with my father ,</l>
       <l n="36">At the doorways of the West-Wind ,</l>
       <l n="37">At the portals of the Sunset ! ”</l>
       <l n="38">From his lodge went Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="39">Dressed for travel , armed for hunting ;</l>
       <l n="40">Dressed in deer-skin shirt and leggings ,</l>
       <l n="41">Richly wrought with quills and wampum ;</l>
       <l n="42">On his head his eagle-feathers ,</l>
       <l n="43">Round his waist his belt of wampum ,</l>
       <l n="44">In his hand his bow of ash-wood ,</l>
       <l n="45">Strung with sinews of the reindeer ;</l>
       <l n="46">In his quiver oaken arrows ,</l>
       <l n="47">Tipped with jasper , winged with feathers ;</l>
       <l n="48">With his mittens , Minjekahwun ,</l>
       <l n="49">With his moccasins enchanted .</l>
       <l n="50">Warning said the old Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="51">“ Go not forth , O Hiawatha !</l>
       <l n="52">To the kingdom of the West-Wind ,</l>
       <l n="53">To the realms of Mudjekeewis ,</l>
       <l n="54">Lest he harm you with his magic ,</l>
       <l n="55">Lest he kill you with his cunning ! ”</l>
       <l n="56">But the fearless Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="57">Heeded not her woman 's warning ;</l>
       <l n="58">Forth he strode into the forest ,</l>
       <l n="59">At each stride a mile he measured ;</l>
       <l n="60">Lurid seemed the sky above him ,</l>
       <l n="61">Lurid seemed the earth beneath him ,</l>
       <l n="62">Hot and close the air around him ,</l>
       <l n="63">Filled with smoke and fiery vapors ,</l>
       <l n="64">As of burning woods and prairies ,</l>
       <l n="65">For his heart was hot within him ,</l>
       <l n="66">Like a living coal his heart was .</l>
       <l n="67">So he journeyed westward , westward ,</l>
       <l n="68">Left the fleetest deer behind him ,</l>
       <l n="69">Left the antelope and bison ;</l>
       <l n="70">Crossed the rushing Esconaba ,</l>
       <l n="71">Crossed the mighty Mississippi ,</l>
       <l n="72">Passed the Mountains of the Prairie ,</l>
       <l n="73">Passed the land of Crows and Foxes ,</l>
       <l n="74">Passed the dwellings of the Blackfeet ,</l>
       <l n="75">Came unto the Rocky Mountains ,</l>
       <l n="76">To the kingdom of the West-Wind ,</l>
       <l n="77">Where upon the gusty summits</l>
       <l n="78">Sat the ancient Mudjekeewis ,</l>
       <l n="79">Ruler of the winds of heaven .</l>
       <l n="80">Filled with awe was Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="81">At the aspect of his father .</l>
       <l n="82">On the air about him wildly</l>
       <l n="83">Tossed and streamed his cloudy tresses ,</l>
       <l n="84">Gleamed like drifting snow his tresses ,</l>
       <l n="85">Glared like Ishkoodah , the comet ,</l>
       <l n="86">Like the star with fiery tresses .</l>
       <l n="87">Filled with joy was Mudjekeewis</l>
       <l n="88">When he looked on Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="89">Saw his youth rise up before him</l>
       <l n="90">In the face of Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="91">Saw the beauty of Wenonah</l>
       <l n="92">From the grave rise up before him .</l>
       <l n="93">“ Welcome ! ” said he , “ Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="94">To the kingdom of the West-Wind !</l>
       <l n="95">Long have I been waiting for you !</l>
       <l n="96">Youth is lovely , age is lonely ,</l>
       <l n="97">Youth is fiery , age is frosty ;</l>
       <l n="98">You bring back the days departed ,</l>
       <l n="99">You bring back my youth of passion ,</l>
       <l n="100">And the beautiful Wenonah ! ”</l>
       <l n="101">Many days they talked together ,</l>
       <l n="102">Questioned , listened , waited , answered ;</l>
       <l n="103">Much the mighty Mudjekeewis</l>
       <l n="104">Boasted of his ancient prowess ,</l>
       <l n="105">Of his perilous adventures ,</l>
       <l n="106">His indomitable courage ,</l>
       <l n="107">His invulnerable body .</l>
       <l n="108">Patiently sat Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="109">Listening to his father 's boasting ;</l>
       <l n="110">With a smile he sat and listened ,</l>
       <l n="111">Uttered neither threat nor menace ,</l>
       <l n="112">Neither word nor look betrayed him ,</l>
       <l n="113">But his heart was hot within him ,</l>
       <l n="114">Like a living coal his heart was .</l>
       <l n="115">Then he said , “ O Mudjekeewis ,</l>
       <l n="116">Is there nothing that can harm you ?</l>
       <l n="117">Nothing that you are afraid of ? ”</l>
       <l n="118">And the mighty Mudjekeewis ,</l>
       <l n="119">Grand and gracious in his boasting ,</l>
       <l n="120">Answered , saying , “ There is nothing ,</l>
       <l n="121">Nothing but the black rock yonder ,</l>
       <l n="122">Nothing but the fatal Wawbeek ! ”</l>
       <l n="123">And he looked at Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="124">With a wise look and benignant ,</l>
       <l n="125">With a countenance paternal ,</l>
       <l n="126">Looked with pride upon the beauty</l>
       <l n="127">Of his tall and graceful figure ,</l>
       <l n="128">Saying , “ O my Hiawatha !</l>
       <l n="129">Is there anything can harm you ?</l>
       <l n="130">Anything you are afraid of ? ”</l>
       <l n="131">But the wary Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="132">Paused awhile , as if uncertain ,</l>
       <l n="133">Held his peace , as if resolving ,</l>
       <l n="134">And then answered , “ There is nothing ,</l>
       <l n="135">Nothing but the bulrush yonder ,</l>
       <l n="136">Nothing but the great Apukwa ! ”</l>
       <l n="137">And as Mudjekeewis , rising ,</l>
       <l n="138">Stretched his hand to pluck the bulrush ,</l>
       <l n="139">Hiawatha cried in terror ,</l>
       <l n="140">Cried in well-dissembled terror ,</l>
       <l n="141">“ Kago ! kago ! do not touch it ! ”</l>
       <l n="142">“ Ah , kaween ! ” said Mudjekeewis ,</l>
       <l n="143">“ No indeed , I will not touch it ! ”</l>
       <l n="144">Then they talked of other matters ;</l>
       <l n="145">First of Hiawatha 's brothers ,</l>
       <l n="146">First of Wabun , of the East-Wind ,</l>
       <l n="147">Of the South-Wind , Shawondasee ,</l>
       <l n="148">Of the North , Kabibonokka ;</l>
       <l n="149">Then of Hiawatha 's mother ,</l>
       <l n="150">Of the beautiful Wenonah ,</l>
       <l n="151">Of her birth upon the meadow ,</l>
       <l n="152">Of her death , as old Nokomis</l>
       <l n="153">Had remembered and related .</l>
       <l n="154">And he cried , “ O Mudjekeewis ,</l>
       <l n="155">It was you who killed Wenonah ,</l>
       <l n="156">Took her young life and her beauty ,</l>
       <l n="157">Broke the Lily of the Prairie ,</l>
       <l n="158">Trampled it beneath your footsteps ;</l>
       <l n="159">You confess it ! you confess it ! ”</l>
       <l n="160">And the mighty Mudjekeewis</l>
       <l n="161">Tossed upon the wind his tresses ,</l>
       <l n="162">Bowed his hoary head in anguish ,</l>
       <l n="163">With a silent nod assented .</l>
       <l n="164">Then up started Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="165">And with threatening look and gesture</l>
       <l n="166">Laid his hand upon the black rock ,</l>
       <l n="167">On the fatal Wawbeek laid it ,</l>
       <l n="168">With his mittens , Minjekahwun ,</l>
       <l n="169">Rent the jutting crag asunder ,</l>
       <l n="170">Smote and crushed it into fragments ,</l>
       <l n="171">Hurled them madly at his father ,</l>
       <l n="172">The remorseful Mudjekeewis ,</l>
       <l n="173">For his heart was hot within him ,</l>
       <l n="174">Like a living coal his heart was .</l>
       <l n="175">But the ruler of the West-Wind</l>
       <l n="176">Blew the fragments backward from him ,</l>
       <l n="177">With the breathing of his nostrils ,</l>
       <l n="178">With the tempest of his anger ,</l>
       <l n="179">Blew them back at his assailant ;</l>
       <l n="180">Seized the bulrush , the Apukwa ,</l>
       <l n="181">Dragged it with its roots and fibres</l>
       <l n="182">From the margin of the meadow ,</l>
       <l n="183">From its ooze the giant bulrush ;</l>
       <l n="184">Long and loud laughed Hiawatha !</l>
       <l n="185">Then began the deadly conflict ,</l>
       <l n="186">Hand to hand among the mountains ;</l>
       <l n="187">From his eyry screamed the eagle ,</l>
       <l n="188">The Keneu , the great war-eagle ,</l>
       <l n="189">Sat upon the crags around them ,</l>
       <l n="190">Wheeling flapped his wings above them .</l>
       <l n="191">Like a tall tree in the tempest</l>
       <l n="192">Bent and lashed the giant bulrush ;</l>
       <l n="193">And in masses huge and heavy</l>
       <l n="194">Crashing fell the fatal Wawbeek ;</l>
       <l n="195">Till the earth shook with the tumult</l>
       <l n="196">And confusion of the battle ,</l>
       <l n="197">And the air was full of shoutings ,</l>
       <l n="198">And the thunder of the mountains ,</l>
       <l n="199">Starting , answered , “ Baim-wawa ! ”</l>
       <l n="200">Back retreated Mudjekeewis ,</l>
       <l n="201">Rushing westward o'er the mountains ,</l>
       <l n="202">Stumbling westward down the mountains ,</l>
       <l n="203">Three whole days retreated fighting ,</l>
       <l n="204">Still pursued by Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="205">To the doorways of the West-Wind ,</l>
       <l n="206">To the portals of the Sunset ,</l>
       <l n="207">To the earth 's remotest border ,</l>
       <l n="208">Where into the empty spaces</l>
       <l n="209">Sinks the sun , as a flamingo</l>
       <l n="210">Drops into her nest at nightfall ,</l>
       <l n="211">In the melancholy marshes .</l>
       <l n="212">“ Hold ! ” at length cried Mudjekeewis ,</l>
       <l n="213">“ Hold , my son , my Hiawatha !</l>
       <l n="214">‘ T is impossible to kill me ,</l>
       <l n="215">For you cannot kill the immortal .</l>
       <l n="216">I have put you to this trial ,</l>
       <l n="217">But to know and prove your courage ;</l>
       <l n="218">Now receive the prize of valor !</l>
       <l n="219">“ Go back to your home and people ,</l>
       <l n="220">Live among them , toil among them ,</l>
       <l n="221">Cleanse the earth from all that harms it ,</l>
       <l n="222">Clear the fishing-grounds and rivers ,</l>
       <l n="223">Slay all monsters and magicians ,</l>
       <l n="224">All the Wendigoes , the giants ,</l>
       <l n="225">All the serpents , the Kenabeeks ,</l>
       <l n="226">As I slew the Mishe-Mokwa ,</l>
       <l n="227">Slew the Great Bear of the mountains .</l>
       <l n="228">“ And at last when Death draws near you ,</l>
       <l n="229">When the awful eyes of Pauguk</l>
       <l n="230">Glare upon you in the darkness ,</l>
       <l n="231">I will share my kingdom with you ,</l>
       <l n="232">Ruler shall you be thenceforward</l>
       <l n="233">Of the Northwest-Wind , Keewaydin ,</l>
       <l n="234">Of the home-wind , the Keewaydin . ”</l>
       <l n="235">Thus was fought that famous battle</l>
       <l n="236">In the dreadful days of Shah-shah ,</l>
       <l n="237">In the days long since departed ,</l>
       <l n="238">In the kingdom of the West-Wind .</l>
       <l n="239">Still the hunter sees its traces</l>
       <l n="240">Scattered far o'er hill and valley ;</l>
       <l n="241">Sees the giant bulrush growing</l>
       <l n="242">By the ponds and water-courses ,</l>
       <l n="243">Sees the masses of the Wawbeek</l>
       <l n="244">Lying still in every valley .</l>
       <l n="245">Homeward now went Hiawatha ;</l>
       <l n="246">Pleasant was the landscape round him ,</l>
       <l n="247">Pleasant was the air above him ,</l>
       <l n="248">For the bitterness of anger</l>
       <l n="249">Had departed wholly from him ,</l>
       <l n="250">From his brain the thought of vengeance ,</l>
       <l n="251">From his heart the burning fever .</l>
       <l n="252">Only once his pace he slackened ,</l>
       <l n="253">Only once he paused or halted ,</l>
       <l n="254">Paused to purchase heads of arrows</l>
       <l n="255">Of the ancient Arrow-maker ,</l>
       <l n="256">In the land of the Dacotahs ,</l>
       <l n="257">Where the Falls of Minnehaha</l>
       <l n="258">Flash and gleam among the oak-trees ,</l>
       <l n="259">Laugh and leap into the valley .</l>
       <l n="260">There the ancient Arrow-maker</l>
       <l n="261">Made his arrow-heads of sandstone ,</l>
       <l n="262">Arrow-heads of chalcedony ,</l>
       <l n="263">Arrow-heads of flint and jasper ,</l>
       <l n="264">Smoothed and sharpened at the edges ,</l>
       <l n="265">Hard and polished , keen and costly .</l>
       <l n="266">With him dwelt his dark-eyed daughter ,</l>
       <l n="267">Wayward as the Minnehaha ,</l>
       <l n="268">With her moods of shade and sunshine ,</l>
       <l n="269">Eyes that smiled and frowned alternate ,</l>
       <l n="270">Feet as rapid as the river ,</l>
       <l n="271">Tresses flowing like the water ,</l>
       <l n="272">And as musical a laughter ;</l>
       <l n="273">And he named her from the river ,</l>
       <l n="274">From the water-fall he named her ,</l>
       <l n="275">Minnehaha , Laughing Water .</l>
       <l n="276">Was it then for heads of arrows ,</l>
       <l n="277">Arrow-heads of chalcedony ,</l>
       <l n="278">Arrow-heads of flint and jasper ,</l>
       <l n="279">That my Hiawatha halted</l>
       <l n="280">In the land of the Dacotahs ?</l>
       <l n="281">Was it not to see the maiden ,</l>
       <l n="282">See the face of Laughing Water</l>
       <l n="283">Peeping from behind the curtain ,</l>
       <l n="284">Hear the rustling of her garments</l>
       <l n="285">From behind the waving curtain ,</l>
       <l n="286">As one sees the Minnehaha</l>
       <l n="287">Gleaming , glancing through the branches ,</l>
       <l n="288">As one hears the Laughing Water</l>
       <l n="289">From behind its screen of branches ?</l>
       <l n="290">Who shall say what thoughts and visions</l>
       <l n="291">Fill the fiery brains of young men ?</l>
       <l n="292">Who shall say what dreams of beauty</l>
       <l n="293">Filled the heart of Hiawatha ?</l>
       <l n="294">All he told to old Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="295">When he reached the lodge at sunset ,</l>
       <l n="296">Was the meeting with his father ,</l>
       <l n="297">Was his fight with Mudjekeewis ;</l>

      <head>HIAWATHA 'S FASTING</head>
       <l n="1">You shall hear how Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="2">Prayed and fasted in the forest ,</l>
       <l n="3">Not for greater skill in hunting ,</l>
       <l n="4">Not for greater craft in fishing ,</l>
       <l n="5">Not for triumphs in the battle ,</l>
       <l n="6">And renown among the warriors ,</l>
       <l n="7">But for profit of the people ,</l>
       <l n="8">For advantage of the nations .</l>
       <l n="9">First he built a lodge for fasting ,</l>
       <l n="10">Built a wigwam in the forest ,</l>
       <l n="11">By the shining Big-Sea-Water ,</l>
       <l n="12">In the blithe and pleasant Spring-time ,</l>
       <l n="13">In the Moon of Leaves he built it ,</l>
       <l n="14">And , with dreams and visions many ,</l>
       <l n="15">Seven whole days and nights he fasted .</l>
       <l n="16">On the first day of his fasting</l>
       <l n="17">Through the leafy woods he wandered ;</l>
       <l n="18">Saw the deer start from the thicket ,</l>
       <l n="19">Saw the rabbit in his burrow ,</l>
       <l n="20">Heard the pheasant , Bena , drumming ,</l>
       <l n="21">Heard the squirrel , Adjidaumo ,</l>
       <l n="22">Rattling in his hoard of acorns ,</l>
       <l n="23">Saw the pigeon , the Omeme ,</l>
       <l n="24">Building nests among the pine-trees ,</l>
       <l n="25">And in flocks the wild-goose , Wawa ,</l>
       <l n="26">Flying to the fen-lands northward ,</l>
       <l n="27">Whirring , wailing far above him .</l>
       <l n="28">“ Master of Life ! ” he cried , desponding ,</l>
       <l n="29">“ Must our lives depend on these things ? ”</l>
       <l n="30">On the next day of his fasting</l>
       <l n="31">By the river 's brink he wandered ,</l>
       <l n="32">Through the Muskoday , the meadow ,</l>
       <l n="33">Saw the wild rice , Mahnomonee ,</l>
       <l n="34">Saw the blueberry , Meenahga ,</l>
       <l n="35">And the strawberry , Odahmin ,</l>
       <l n="36">And the gooseberry , Shahbomin ,</l>
       <l n="37">And the grape-vine , the Bemahgut ,</l>
       <l n="38">Trailing o'er the alder-branches ,</l>
       <l n="39">Filling all the air with fragrance !</l>
       <l n="40">“ Master of Life ! ” he cried , desponding ,</l>
       <l n="41">“ Must our lives depend on these things ? ”</l>
       <l n="42">On the third day of his fasting</l>
       <l n="43">By the lake he sat and pondered ,</l>
       <l n="44">By the still , transparent water ;</l>
       <l n="45">Saw the sturgeon , Nahma , leaping ,</l>
       <l n="46">Scattering drops like beads of wampum ,</l>
       <l n="47">Saw the yellow perch , the Sahwa ,</l>
       <l n="48">Like a sunbeam in the water ,</l>
       <l n="49">Saw the pike , the Maskenozha ,</l>
       <l n="50">And the herring , Okahahwis ,</l>
       <l n="51">And the Shawgashee , the crawfish !</l>
       <l n="52">“ Master of Life ! ” he cried , desponding ,</l>
       <l n="53">“ Must our lives depend on these things ? ”</l>
       <l n="54">On the fourth day of his fasting</l>
       <l n="55">In his lodge he lay exhausted ;</l>
       <l n="56">From his couch of leaves and branches</l>
       <l n="57">Gazing with half-open eyelids ,</l>
       <l n="58">Full of shadowy dreams and visions ,</l>
       <l n="59">On the dizzy , swimming landscape ,</l>
       <l n="60">On the gleaming of the water ,</l>
       <l n="61">On the splendor of the sunset .</l>
       <l n="62">And he saw a youth approaching ,</l>
       <l n="63">Dressed in garments green and yellow ,</l>
       <l n="64">Coming through the purple twilight ,</l>
       <l n="65">Through the splendor of the sunset ;</l>
       <l n="66">Plumes of green bent o'er his forehead ,</l>
       <l n="67">And his hair was soft and golden .</l>
       <l n="68">Standing at the open doorway ,</l>
       <l n="69">Long he looked at Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="70">Looked with pity and compassion</l>
       <l n="71">On his wasted form and features ,</l>
       <l n="72">And , in accents like the sighing</l>
       <l n="73">Of the South-Wind in the tree-tops ,</l>
       <l n="74">Said he , “ O my Hiawatha !</l>
       <l n="75">All your prayers are heard in heaven ,</l>
       <l n="76">For you pray not like the others ;</l>
       <l n="77">Not for greater skill in hunting ,</l>
       <l n="78">Not for greater craft in fishing ,</l>
       <l n="79">Not for triumph in the battle ,</l>
       <l n="80">Nor renown among the warriors ,</l>
       <l n="81">But for profit of the people ,</l>
       <l n="82">For advantage of the nations .</l>
       <l n="83">“ From the Master of Life descending ,</l>
       <l n="84">I , the friend of man , Mondamin ,</l>
       <l n="85">Come to warn you and instruct you ,</l>
       <l n="86">How by struggle and by labor</l>
       <l n="87">You shall gain what you have prayed for .</l>
       <l n="88">Rise up from your bed of branches ,</l>
       <l n="89">Rise , O youth , and wrestle with me ! ”</l>
       <l n="90">Faint with famine , Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="91">Started from his bed of branches ,</l>
       <l n="92">From the twilight of his wigwam</l>
       <l n="93">Forth into the flush of sunset</l>
       <l n="94">Came , and wrestled with Mondamin ;</l>
       <l n="95">At his touch he felt new courage</l>
       <l n="96">Throbbing in his brain and bosom ,</l>
       <l n="97">Felt new life and hope and vigor</l>
       <l n="98">Run through every nerve and fibre .</l>
       <l n="99">So they wrestled there together</l>
       <l n="100">In the glory of the sunset ,</l>
       <l n="101">And the more they strove and struggled ,</l>
       <l n="102">Stronger still grew Hiawatha ;</l>
       <l n="103">Till the darkness fell around them ,</l>
       <l n="104">And the heron , the Shuh-shuh-gah ,</l>
       <l n="105">From her nest among the pine-trees ,</l>
       <l n="106">Gave a cry of lamentation ,</l>
       <l n="107">Gave a scream of pain and famine .</l>
       <l n="108">“ ‘ T is enough ! ” then said Mondamin ,</l>
       <l n="109">Smiling upon Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="110">“ But tomorrow , when the sun sets ,</l>
       <l n="111">I will come again to try you . ”</l>
       <l n="112">And he vanished , and was seen not ;</l>
       <l n="113">Whether sinking as the rain sinks ,</l>
       <l n="114">Whether rising as the mists rise ,</l>
       <l n="115">Hiawatha saw not , knew not ,</l>
       <l n="116">Only saw that he had vanished ,</l>
       <l n="117">Leaving him alone and fainting ,</l>
       <l n="118">With the misty lake below him ,</l>
       <l n="119">And the reeling stars above him .</l>
       <l n="120">On the morrow and the next day ,</l>
       <l n="121">When the sun through heaven descending ,</l>
       <l n="122">Like a red and burning cinder</l>
       <l n="123">From the hearth of the Great Spirit ,</l>
       <l n="124">Fell into the western waters ,</l>
       <l n="125">Came Mondamin for the trial ,</l>
       <l n="126">For the strife with Hiawatha ;</l>
       <l n="127">Came as silent as the dew comes ,</l>
       <l n="128">From the empty air appearing ,</l>
       <l n="129">Into empty air returning ,</l>
       <l n="130">Taking shape when earth it touches ,</l>
       <l n="131">But invisible to all men</l>
       <l n="132">In its coming and its going .</l>
       <l n="133">Thrice they wrestled there together</l>
       <l n="134">In the glory of the sunset ,</l>
       <l n="135">Till the darkness fell around them ,</l>
       <l n="136">Till the heron , the Shuh-shuh-gah ,</l>
       <l n="137">From her nest among the pine-trees ,</l>
       <l n="138">Uttered her loud cry of famine ,</l>
       <l n="139">And Mondamin paused to listen .</l>
       <l n="140">Tall and beautiful he stood there ,</l>
       <l n="141">In his garments green and yellow ;</l>
       <l n="142">To and fro his plumes above him ,</l>
       <l n="143">Waved and nodded with his breathing ,</l>
       <l n="144">And the sweat of the encounter</l>
       <l n="145">Stood like drops of dew upon him .</l>
       <l n="146">And he cried , “ O Hiawatha !</l>
       <l n="147">Bravely have you wrestled with me ,</l>
       <l n="148">Thrice have wrestled stoutly with me ,</l>
       <l n="149">And the Master of Life , who sees us ,</l>
       <l n="150">He will give to you the triumph ! ”</l>
       <l n="151">Then he smiled , and said : “ To-morrow</l>
       <l n="152">Is the last day of your conflict ,</l>
       <l n="153">Is the last day of your fasting .</l>
       <l n="154">You will conquer and o'ercome me ;</l>
       <l n="155">Make a bed for me to lie in ,</l>
       <l n="156">Where the rain may fall upon me ,</l>
       <l n="157">Where the sun may come and warm me ;</l>
       <l n="158">Strip these garments , green and yellow ,</l>
       <l n="159">Strip this nodding plumage from me ,</l>
       <l n="160">Lay me in the earth , and make it</l>
       <l n="161">Soft and loose and light above me .</l>
       <l n="162">“ Let no hand disturb my slumber ,</l>
       <l n="163">Let no weed nor worm molest me ,</l>
       <l n="164">Let not Kahgahgee , the raven ,</l>
       <l n="165">Come to haunt me and molest me ,</l>
       <l n="166">Only come yourself to watch me ,</l>
       <l n="167">Till I wake , and start , and quicken ,</l>
       <l n="168">Till I leap into the sunshine . ”</l>
       <l n="169">And thus saying , he departed ;</l>
       <l n="170">Peacefully slept Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="171">But he heard the Wawonaissa ,</l>
       <l n="172">Heard the whippoorwill complaining ,</l>
       <l n="173">Perched upon his lonely wigwam ;</l>
       <l n="174">Heard the rushing Sebowisha ,</l>
       <l n="175">Heard the rivulet rippling near him ,</l>
       <l n="176">Talking to the darksome forest ;</l>
       <l n="177">Heard the sighing of the branches ,</l>
       <l n="178">As they lifted and subsided</l>
       <l n="179">At the passing of the night-wind ,</l>
       <l n="180">Heard them , as one hears in slumber</l>
       <l n="181">Far-off murmurs , dreamy whispers :</l>
       <l n="182">Peacefully slept Hiawatha .</l>
       <l n="183">On the morrow came Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="184">On the seventh day of his fasting ,</l>
       <l n="185">Came with food for Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="186">Came imploring and bewailing ,</l>
       <l n="187">Lest his hunger should o'ercome him ,</l>
       <l n="188">Lest his fasting should be fatal .</l>
       <l n="189">But he tasted not , and touched not ,</l>
       <l n="190">Only said to her , “ Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="191">Wait until the sun is setting ,</l>
       <l n="192">Till the darkness falls around us ,</l>
       <l n="193">Till the heron , the Shuh-shuh-gah ,</l>
       <l n="194">Crying from the desolate marshes ,</l>
       <l n="195">Tells us that the day is ended . ”</l>
       <l n="196">Homeward weeping went Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="197">Sorrowing for her Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="198">Fearing lest his strength should fail him ,</l>
       <l n="199">Lest his fasting should be fatal .</l>
       <l n="200">He meanwhile sat weary waiting</l>
       <l n="201">For the coming of Mondamin ,</l>
       <l n="202">Till the shadows , pointing eastward ,</l>
       <l n="203">Lengthened over field and forest ,</l>
       <l n="204">Till the sun dropped from the heaven ,</l>
       <l n="205">Floating on the waters westward ,</l>
       <l n="206">As a red leaf in the Autumn</l>
       <l n="207">Falls and floats upon the water ,</l>
       <l n="208">Falls and sinks into its bosom .</l>
       <l n="209">And behold ! the young Mondamin ,</l>
       <l n="210">With his soft and shining tresses ,</l>
       <l n="211">With his garments green and yellow ,</l>
       <l n="212">With his long and glossy plumage ,</l>
       <l n="213">Stood and beckoned at the doorway .</l>
       <l n="214">And as one in slumber walking ,</l>
       <l n="215">Pale and haggard , but undaunted ,</l>
       <l n="216">From the wigwam Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="217">Came and wrestled with Mondamin .</l>
       <l n="218">Round about him spun the landscape ,</l>
       <l n="219">Sky and forest reeled together ,</l>
       <l n="220">And his strong heart leaped within him ,</l>
       <l n="221">As the sturgeon leaps and struggles</l>
       <l n="222">In a net to break its meshes .</l>
       <l n="223">Like a ring of fire around him</l>
       <l n="224">Blazed and flared the red horizon ,</l>
       <l n="225">And a hundred suns seemed looking</l>
       <l n="226">At the combat of the wrestlers .</l>
       <l n="227">Suddenly upon the greensward</l>
       <l n="228">All alone stood Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="229">Panting with his wild exertion ,</l>
       <l n="230">Palpitating with the struggle ;</l>
       <l n="231">And before him breathless , lifeless ,</l>
       <l n="232">Lay the youth , with hair dishevelled ,</l>
       <l n="233">Plumage torn , and garments tattered ,</l>
       <l n="234">Dead he lay there in the sunset .</l>
       <l n="235">And victorious Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="236">Made the grave as he commanded ,</l>
       <l n="237">Stripped the garments from Mondamin ,</l>
       <l n="238">Stripped his tattered plumage from him ,</l>
       <l n="239">Laid him in the earth , and made it</l>
       <l n="240">Soft and loose and light above him ;</l>
       <l n="241">And the heron , the Shuh-shuh-gah ,</l>
       <l n="242">From the melancholy moorlands ,</l>
       <l n="243">Gave a cry of lamentation ,</l>
       <l n="244">Gave a cry of pain and anguish !</l>
       <l n="245">Homeward then went Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="246">To the lodge of old Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="247">And the seven days of his fasting</l>
       <l n="248">Were accomplished and completed .</l>
       <l n="249">But the place was not forgotten</l>
       <l n="250">Where he wrestled with Mondamin ;</l>
       <l n="251">Nor forgotten nor neglected</l>
       <l n="252">Was the grave where lay Mondamin ,</l>
       <l n="253">Sleeping in the rain and sunshine ,</l>
       <l n="254">Where his scattered plumes and garments</l>
       <l n="255">Faded in the rain and sunshine .</l>
       <l n="256">Day by day did Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="257">Go to wait and watch beside it ;</l>
       <l n="258">Kept the dark mould soft above it ,</l>
       <l n="259">Kept it clean from weeds and insects ,</l>
       <l n="260">Drove away , with scoffs and shoutings ,</l>
       <l n="261">Kahgahgee , the king of ravens .</l>
       <l n="262">Till at length a small green feather</l>
       <l n="263">From the earth shot slowly upward ,</l>
       <l n="264">Then another and another ,</l>
       <l n="265">And before the Summer ended</l>
       <l n="266">Stood the maize in all its beauty ,</l>
       <l n="267">With its shining robes about it ,</l>
       <l n="268">And its long , soft , yellow tresses ;</l>
       <l n="269">And in rapture Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="270">Cried aloud , “ It is Mondamin !</l>
       <l n="271">Yes , the friend of man , Mondamin ! ”</l>
       <l n="272">Then he called to old Nokomis</l>
       <l n="273">And Iagoo , the great boaster ,</l>
       <l n="274">Showed them where the maize was growing ,</l>
       <l n="275">Told them of his wondrous vision ,</l>
       <l n="276">Of his wrestling and his triumph ,</l>
       <l n="277">Of this new gift to the nations ,</l>
       <l n="278">Which should be their food forever .</l>
       <l n="279">And still later , when the Autumn</l>
       <l n="280">Changed the long , green leaves to yellow ,</l>
       <l n="281">And the soft and juicy kernels</l>
       <l n="282">Grew like wampum hard and yellow ,</l>
       <l n="283">Then the ripened ears he gathered ,</l>
       <l n="284">Stripped the withered husks from off them ,</l>
       <l n="285">As he once had stripped the wrestler ,</l>
       <l n="286">Gave the first Feast of Mondamin ,</l>
       <l n="287">And made known unto the people</l>
       <l n="288">This new gift of the Great Spirit .</l>

      <head>HIAWATHA 'S FRIENDS</head>
       <l n="1">Two good friends had Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="2">Singled out from all the others ,</l>
       <l n="3">Bound to him in closest union ,</l>
       <l n="4">And to whom he gave the right hand</l>
       <l n="5">Of his heart , in joy and sorrow ;</l>
       <l n="6">Chibiabos , the musician ,</l>
       <l n="7">And the very strong man , Kwasind .</l>
       <l n="8">Straight between them ran the pathway ,</l>
       <l n="9">Never grew the grass upon it ;</l>
       <l n="10">Singing birds , that utter falsehoods ,</l>
       <l n="11">Story-tellers , mischief-makers ,</l>
       <l n="12">Found no eager ear to listen ,</l>
       <l n="13">Could not breed ill-will between them ,</l>
       <l n="14">For they kept each other 's counsel ,</l>
       <l n="15">Spake with naked hearts together ,</l>
       <l n="16">Pondering much and much contriving</l>
       <l n="17">How the tribes of men might prosper .</l>
       <l n="18">Most beloved by Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="19">Was the gentle Chibiabos ,</l>
       <l n="20">He the best of all musicians ,</l>
       <l n="21">He the sweetest of all singers .</l>
       <l n="22">Beautiful and childlike was he ,</l>
       <l n="23">Brave as man is , soft as woman ,</l>
       <l n="24">Pliant as a wand of willow ,</l>
       <l n="25">Stately as a deer with antlers .</l>
       <l n="26">When he sang , the village listened ;</l>
       <l n="27">All the warriors gathered round him ,</l>
       <l n="28">All the women came to hear him ;</l>
       <l n="29">Now he stirred their souls to passion ,</l>
       <l n="30">Now he melted them to pity .</l>
       <l n="31">From the hollow reeds he fashioned</l>
       <l n="32">Flutes so musical and mellow ,</l>
       <l n="33">That the brook , the Sebowisha ,</l>
       <l n="34">Ceased to murmur in the woodland ,</l>
       <l n="35">That the wood-birds ceased from singing ,</l>
       <l n="36">And the squirrel , Adjidaumo ,</l>
       <l n="37">Ceased his chatter in the oak-tree ,</l>
       <l n="38">And the rabbit , the Wabasso ,</l>
       <l n="39">Sat upright to look and listen .</l>
       <l n="40">Yes , the brook , the Sebowisha ,</l>
       <l n="41">Pausing , said , “ O Chibiabos ,</l>
       <l n="42">Teach my waves to flow in music ,</l>
       <l n="43">Softly as your words in singing ! ”</l>
       <l n="44">Yes , the bluebird , the Owaissa ,</l>
       <l n="45">Envious , said , “ O Chibiabos ,</l>
       <l n="46">Teach me tones as wild and wayward ,</l>
       <l n="47">Teach me songs as full of frenzy ! ”</l>
       <l n="48">Yes , the robin , the Opechee ,</l>
       <l n="49">Joyous , said , “ O Chibiabos ,</l>
       <l n="50">Teach me tones as sweet and tender ,</l>
       <l n="51">Teach me songs as full of gladness ! ”</l>
       <l n="52">And the whippoorwill , Wawonaissa ,</l>
       <l n="53">Sobbing , said , “ O Chibiabos ,</l>
       <l n="54">Teach me tones as melancholy ,</l>
       <l n="55">Teach me songs as full of sadness ! ”</l>
       <l n="56">All the many sounds of nature</l>
       <l n="57">Borrowed sweetness from his singing ;</l>
       <l n="58">All the hearts of men were softened</l>
       <l n="59">By the pathos of his music ;</l>
       <l n="60">For he sang of peace and freedom ,</l>
       <l n="61">Sang of beauty , love , and longing ;</l>
       <l n="62">Sang of death , and life undying</l>
       <l n="63">In the Islands of the Blessed ,</l>
       <l n="64">In the kingdom of Ponemah ,</l>
       <l n="65">In the land of the Hereafter .</l>
       <l n="66">Very dear to Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="67">Was the gentle Chibiabos ,</l>
       <l n="68">He the best of all musicians ,</l>
       <l n="69">He the sweetest of all singers ;</l>
       <l n="70">For his gentleness he loved him ,</l>
       <l n="71">And the magic of his singing .</l>
       <l n="72">Dear , too , unto Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="73">Was the very strong man , Kwasind ,</l>
       <l n="74">He the strongest of all mortals ,</l>
       <l n="75">He the mightiest among many ;</l>
       <l n="76">For his very strength he loved him ,</l>
       <l n="77">For his strength allied to goodness .</l>
       <l n="78">Idle in his youth was Kwasind ,</l>
       <l n="79">Very listless , dull , and dreamy ,</l>
       <l n="80">Never played with other children ,</l>
       <l n="81">Never fished and never hunted ,</l>
       <l n="82">Not like other children was he ;</l>
       <l n="83">But they saw that much he fasted ,</l>
       <l n="84">Much his Manito entreated ,</l>
       <l n="85">Much besought his Guardian Spirit .</l>
       <l n="86">“ Lazy Kwasind ! ” said his mother ,</l>
       <l n="87">“ In my work you never help me !</l>
       <l n="88">In the Summer you are roaming</l>
       <l n="89">Idly in the fields and forests ;</l>
       <l n="90">In the Winter you are cowering</l>
       <l n="91">O'er the firebrands in the wigwam !</l>
       <l n="92">In the coldest days of Winter</l>
       <l n="93">I must break the ice for fishing ;</l>
       <l n="94">With my nets you never help me !</l>
       <l n="95">At the door my nets are hanging ,</l>
       <l n="96">Dripping , freezing with the water ;</l>
       <l n="97">Go and wring them , Yenadizze !</l>
       <l n="98">Go and dry them in the sunshine ! ”</l>
       <l n="99">Slowly , from the ashes , Kwasind</l>
       <l n="100">Rose , but made no angry answer ;</l>
       <l n="101">From the lodge went forth in silence ,</l>
       <l n="102">Took the nets , that hung together ,</l>
       <l n="103">Dripping , freezing at the doorway ;</l>
       <l n="104">Like a wisp of straw he wrung them ,</l>
       <l n="105">Like a wisp of straw he broke them ,</l>
       <l n="106">Could not wring them without breaking ,</l>
       <l n="107">Such the strength was in his fingers .</l>
       <l n="108">“ Lazy Kwasind ! ” said his father ,</l>
       <l n="109">“ In the hunt you never help me ;</l>
       <l n="110">Every bow you touch is broken ,</l>
       <l n="111">Snapped asunder every arrow ;</l>
       <l n="112">Yet come with me to the forest ,</l>
       <l n="113">You shall bring the hunting homeward . ”</l>
       <l n="114">Down a narrow pass they wandered ,</l>
       <l n="115">Where a brooklet led them onward ,</l>
       <l n="116">Where the trail of deer and bison</l>
       <l n="117">Marked the soft mud on the margin ,</l>
       <l n="118">Till they found all further passage</l>
       <l n="119">Shut against them , barred securely</l>
       <l n="120">By the trunks of trees uprooted ,</l>
       <l n="121">Lying lengthwise , lying crosswise ,</l>
       <l n="122">And forbidding further passage .</l>
       <l n="123">“ We must go back , ” said the old man ,</l>
       <l n="124">“ O'er these logs we cannot clamber ;</l>
       <l n="125">Not a woodchuck could get through them ,</l>
       <l n="126">Not a squirrel clamber o'er them ! ”</l>
       <l n="127">And straightway his pipe he lighted ,</l>
       <l n="128">And sat down to smoke and ponder .</l>
       <l n="129">But before his pipe was finished ,</l>
       <l n="130">Lo ! the path was cleared before him ;</l>
       <l n="131">All the trunks had Kwasind lifted ,</l>
       <l n="132">To the right hand , to the left hand ,</l>
       <l n="133">Shot the pine-trees swift as arrows ,</l>
       <l n="134">Hurled the cedars light as lances .</l>
       <l n="135">“ Lazy Kwasind ! ” said the young men ,</l>
       <l n="136">As they sported in the meadow :</l>
       <l n="137">“ Why stand idly looking at us ,</l>
       <l n="138">Leaning on the rock behind you ?</l>
       <l n="139">Come and wrestle with the others ,</l>
       <l n="140">Let us pitch the quoit together ! ”</l>
       <l n="141">Lazy Kwasind made no answer ,</l>
       <l n="142">To their challenge made no answer ,</l>
       <l n="143">Only rose , and slowly turning ,</l>
       <l n="144">Seized the huge rock in his fingers ,</l>
       <l n="145">Tore it from its deep foundation ,</l>
       <l n="146">Poised it in the air a moment ,</l>
       <l n="147">Pitched it sheer into the river ,</l>
       <l n="148">Sheer into the swift Pauwating ,</l>
       <l n="149">Where it still is seen in Summer .</l>
       <l n="150">Once as down that foaming river ,</l>
       <l n="151">Down the rapids of Pauwating ,</l>
       <l n="152">Kwasind sailed with his companions ,</l>
       <l n="153">In the stream he saw a beaver ,</l>
       <l n="154">Saw Ahmeek , the King of Beavers ,</l>
       <l n="155">Struggling with the rushing currents ,</l>
       <l n="156">Rising , sinking in the water .</l>
       <l n="157">Without speaking , without pausing ,</l>
       <l n="158">Kwasind leaped into the river ,</l>
       <l n="159">Plunged beneath the bubbling surface ,</l>
       <l n="160">Through the whirlpools chased the beaver ,</l>
       <l n="161">Followed him among the islands ,</l>
       <l n="162">Stayed so long beneath the water ,</l>
       <l n="163">That his terrified companions</l>
       <l n="164">Cried , “ Alas ! good-by to Kwasind !</l>
       <l n="165">We shall never more see Kwasind ! ”</l>
       <l n="166">But he reappeared triumphant ,</l>
       <l n="167">And upon his shining shoulders</l>
       <l n="168">Brought the beaver , dead and dripping ,</l>
       <l n="169">Brought the King of all the Beavers .</l>
       <l n="170">And these two , as I have told you ,</l>
       <l n="171">Were the friends of Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="172">Chibiabos , the musician ,</l>
       <l n="173">And the very strong man , Kwasind .</l>
       <l n="174">Long they lived in peace together ,</l>
       <l n="175">Spake with naked hearts together ,</l>
       <l n="176">Pondering much and much contriving</l>
       <l n="177">How the tribes of men might prosper .</l>

      <head>HIAWATHA 'S SAILING</head>
       <l n="1">“ Give me of your bark , O Birch-tree !</l>
       <l n="2">Of your yellow bark , O Birch-tree !</l>
       <l n="3">Growing by the rushing river ,</l>
       <l n="4">Tall and stately in the valley !</l>
       <l n="5">I a light canoe will build me ,</l>
       <l n="6">Build a swift Cheemaun for sailing ,</l>
       <l n="7">That shall float on the river ,</l>
       <l n="8">Like a yellow leaf in Autumn ,</l>
       <l n="9">Like a yellow water-lily !</l>
       <l n="10">“ Lay aside your cloak , O Birch-tree !</l>
       <l n="11">Lay aside your white-skin wrapper ,</l>
       <l n="12">For the Summer-time is coming ,</l>
       <l n="13">And the sun is warm in heaven ,</l>
       <l n="14">And you need no white-skin wrapper ! ”</l>
       <l n="15">Thus aloud cried Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="16">In the solitary forest ,</l>
       <l n="17">By the rushing Taquamenaw ,</l>
       <l n="18">When the birds were singing gayly ,</l>
       <l n="19">In the Moon of Leaves were singing ,</l>
       <l n="20">And the sun , from sleep awaking ,</l>
       <l n="21">Started up and said , “ Behold me !</l>
       <l n="22">Gheezis , the great Sun , behold me ! ”</l>
       <l n="23">And the tree with all its branches</l>
       <l n="24">Rustled in the breeze of morning ,</l>
       <l n="25">Saying , with a sigh of patience ,</l>
       <l n="26">“ Take my cloak , O Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="27">With his knife the tree he girdled ;</l>
       <l n="28">Just beneath its lowest branches ,</l>
       <l n="29">Just above the roots , he cut it ,</l>
       <l n="30">Till the sap came oozing outward ;</l>
       <l n="31">Down the trunk , from top to bottom ,</l>
       <l n="32">Sheer he cleft the bark asunder ,</l>
       <l n="33">With a wooden wedge he raised it ,</l>
       <l n="34">Stripped it from the trunk unbroken .</l>
       <l n="35">“ Give me of your boughs , O Cedar !</l>
       <l n="36">Of your strong and pliant branches ,</l>
       <l n="37">My canoe to make more steady ,</l>
       <l n="38">Make more strong and firm beneath me ! ”</l>
       <l n="39">Through the summit of the Cedar</l>
       <l n="40">Went a sound , a cry of horror ,</l>
       <l n="41">Went a murmur of resistance ;</l>
       <l n="42">But it whispered , bending downward ,</l>
       <l n="43">‘ Take my boughs , O Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="44">Down he hewed the boughs of cedar ,</l>
       <l n="45">Shaped them straightway to a framework ,</l>
       <l n="46">Like two bows he formed and shaped them ,</l>
       <l n="47">Like two bended bows together .</l>
       <l n="48">“ Give me of your roots , O Tamarack !</l>
       <l n="49">Of your fibrous roots , O Larch-tree !</l>
       <l n="50">My canoe to bind together ,</l>
       <l n="51">So to bind the ends together</l>
       <l n="52">That the water may not enter ,</l>
       <l n="53">That the river may not wet me ! ”</l>
       <l n="54">And the Larch , with all its fibres ,</l>
       <l n="55">Shivered in the air of morning ,</l>
       <l n="56">Touched his forehead with its tassels ,</l>
       <l n="57">Slid , with one long sigh of sorrow .</l>
       <l n="58">“ Take them all , O Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="59">From the earth he tore the fibres ,</l>
       <l n="60">Tore the tough roots of the Larch-tree ,</l>
       <l n="61">Closely sewed the bark together ,</l>
       <l n="62">Bound it closely to the frame-work .</l>
       <l n="63">“ Give me of your balm , O Fir-tree !</l>
       <l n="64">Of your balsam and your resin ,</l>
       <l n="65">So to close the seams together</l>
       <l n="66">That the water may not enter ,</l>
       <l n="67">That the river may not wet me ! ”</l>
       <l n="68">And the Fir-tree , tall and sombre ,</l>
       <l n="69">Sobbed through all its robes of darkness ,</l>
       <l n="70">Rattled like a shore with pebbles ,</l>
       <l n="71">Answered wailing , answered weeping ,</l>
       <l n="72">“ Take my balm , O Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="73">And he took the tears of balsam ,</l>
       <l n="74">Took the resin of the Fir-tree ,</l>
       <l n="75">Smeared therewith each seam and fissure ,</l>
       <l n="76">Made each crevice safe from water .</l>
       <l n="77">“ Give me of your quills , O Hedgehog !</l>
       <l n="78">All your quills , O Kagh , the Hedgehog !</l>
       <l n="79">I will make a necklace of them ,</l>
       <l n="80">Make a girdle for my beauty ,</l>
       <l n="81">And two stars to deck her bosom ! ”</l>
       <l n="82">From a hollow tree the Hedgehog</l>
       <l n="83">With his sleepy eyes looked at him ,</l>
       <l n="84">Shot his shining quills , like arrows ,</l>
       <l n="85">Saying with a drowsy murmur ,</l>
       <l n="86">Through the tangle of his whiskers ,</l>
       <l n="87">“ Take my quills , O Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="88">From the ground the quills he gathered ,</l>
       <l n="89">All the little shining arrows ,</l>
       <l n="90">Stained them red and blue and yellow ,</l>
       <l n="91">With the juice of roots and berries ;</l>
       <l n="92">Into his canoe he wrought them ,</l>
       <l n="93">Round its waist a shining girdle ,</l>
       <l n="94">Round its bows a gleaming necklace ,</l>
       <l n="95">On its breast two stars resplendent .</l>
       <l n="96">Thus the Birch Canoe was builded</l>
       <l n="97">In the valley , by the river ,</l>
       <l n="98">In the bosom of the forest ;</l>
       <l n="99">And the forest 's life was in it ,</l>
       <l n="100">All its mystery and its magic ,</l>
       <l n="101">All the lightness of the birch-tree ,</l>
       <l n="102">All the toughness of the cedar ,</l>
       <l n="103">All the larch 's supple sinews ;</l>
       <l n="104">And it floated on the river</l>
       <l n="105">Like a yellow leaf in Autumn ,</l>
       <l n="106">Like a yellow water-lily .</l>
       <l n="107">Paddles none had Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="108">Paddles none he had or needed ,</l>
       <l n="109">For his thoughts as paddles served him ,</l>
       <l n="110">And his wishes served to guide him ;</l>
       <l n="111">Swift or slow at will he glided ,</l>
       <l n="112">Veered to right or left at pleasure .</l>
       <l n="113">Then he called aloud to Kwasind ,</l>
       <l n="114">To his friend , the strong man , Kwasind ,</l>
       <l n="115">Saying , “ Help me clear this river</l>
       <l n="116">Of its sunken logs and sand-bars . ”</l>
       <l n="117">Straight into the river Kwasind</l>
       <l n="118">Plunged as if he were an otter ,</l>
       <l n="119">Dived as if he were a beaver ,</l>
       <l n="120">Stood up to his waist in water ,</l>
       <l n="121">To his arm-pits in the river ,</l>
       <l n="122">Swam and scouted in the river ,</l>
       <l n="123">Tugged at sunken logs and branches ,</l>
       <l n="124">With his hands he scooped the sand-bars ,</l>
       <l n="125">With his feet the ooze and tangle .</l>
       <l n="126">And thus sailed my Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="127">Down the rushing Taquamenaw ,</l>
       <l n="128">Sailed through all its bends and windings ,</l>
       <l n="129">Sailed through all its deeps and shallows ,</l>
       <l n="130">While his friend , the strong man , Kwasind ,</l>
       <l n="131">Swam the deeps , the shallows waded .</l>
       <l n="132">Up and down the river went they ,</l>
       <l n="133">In and out among its islands ,</l>
       <l n="134">Cleared its bed of root and sand-bar ,</l>
       <l n="135">Dragged the dead trees from its channel ,</l>
       <l n="136">Made its passage safe and certain ,</l>
       <l n="137">Made a pathway for the people ,</l>
       <l n="138">From its springs among the mountains ,</l>
       <l n="139">To the waters of Pauwating ,</l>
       <l n="140">To the bay of Taquamenaw .</l>

       <l n="7">In his birch canoe exulting</l>
       <l n="8">All alone went Hiawatha .</l>
       <l n="9">Through the clear , transparent water</l>
       <l n="10">He could see the fishes swimming</l>
       <l n="11">Far down in the depths below him ;</l>
       <l n="12">See the yellow perch , the Sahwa ,</l>
       <l n="13">Like a sunbeam in the water ,</l>
       <l n="14">See the Shawgashee , the craw-fish ,</l>

       <l n="16">On the white and sandy bottom .</l>

       <l n="20">Played as in the hemlock branches ;</l>
       <l n="21">On the bows , with tail erected ,</l>
       <l n="22">Sat the squirrel , Adjidaumo ;</l>
       <l n="23">In his fur the breeze of morning</l>
       <l n="24">Played as in the prairie grasses .</l>

       <l n="26">Lay the monster Mishe-Nahma ,</l>
       <l n="27">Lay the sturgeon , King of Fishes ;</l>
       <l n="28">Through his gills he breathed the water ,</l>
       <l n="29">With his fins he fanned and winnowed ,</l>
       <l n="30">With his tail he swept the sand-floor .</l>
       <l n="31">There he lay in all his armor ;</l>
       <l n="32">On each side a shield to guard him ,</l>
       <l n="33">Plates of bone upon his forehead ,</l>
       <l n="34">Down his sides and back and shoulders</l>
       <l n="35">Plates of bone with spines projecting</l>

       <l n="43">With his fishing-line of cedar .</l>
       <l n="44">“ Take my bait , ” cried Hiawatha ,</l>

       <l n="47">Come up from below the water ,</l>
       <l n="48">Let us see which is the stronger ! ”</l>
       <l n="49">And he dropped his line of cedar</l>
       <l n="50">Through the clear , transparent water ,</l>
       <l n="51">Waited vainly for an answer ,</l>
       <l n="52">Long sat waiting for an answer ,</l>
       <l n="53">And repeating loud and louder ,</l>

       <l n="58">Listening to his call and clamor ,</l>
       <l n="59">His unnecessary tumult ,</l>
       <l n="60">Till he wearied of the shouting ;</l>

       <l n="65">In his fingers Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="66">Felt the loose line jerk and tighten ;</l>
       <l n="67">As he drew it in , it tugged so</l>
       <l n="68">That the birch canoe stood endwise ,</l>
       <l n="69">Like a birch log in the water ,</l>
       <l n="70">With the squirrel , Adjidaumo ,</l>
       <l n="71">Perched and frisking on the summit .</l>
       <l n="72">Full of scorn was Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="73">When he saw the fish rise upward ,</l>
       <l n="74">Saw the pike , the Maskenozha ,</l>
       <l n="75">Coming nearer , nearer to him ,</l>
       <l n="76">And he shouted through the water ,</l>
       <l n="77">“ Esa ! esa ! shame upon you !</l>
       <l n="78">You are but the pike , Kenozha ,</l>
       <l n="79">You are not the fish I wanted ,</l>
       <l n="80">You are not the King of Fishes ! ”</l>
       <l n="81">Reeling downward to the bottom</l>
       <l n="82">Sank the pike in great confusion ,</l>
       <l n="83">And the mighty sturgeon , Nahma ,</l>
       <l n="84">Said to Ugudwash , the sun-fish ,</l>
       <l n="85">To the bream , with scales of crimson ,</l>
       <l n="86">“ Take the bait of this great boaster ,</l>
       <l n="87">Break the line of Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="88">Slowly upward , wavering , gleaming ,</l>
       <l n="89">Rose the Ugudwash , the sun-fish ,</l>
       <l n="90">Seized the line of Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="91">Swung with all his weight upon it ,</l>
       <l n="92">Made a whirlpool in the water ,</l>
       <l n="93">Whirled the birch canoe in circles ,</l>
       <l n="94">Round and round in gurgling eddies ,</l>
       <l n="95">Till the circles in the water</l>
       <l n="96">Reached the far-off sandy beaches ,</l>
       <l n="97">Till the water-flags and rushes</l>
       <l n="98">Nodded on the distant margins .</l>
       <l n="99">But when Hiawatha saw him</l>
       <l n="100">Slowly rising through the water ,</l>
       <l n="101">Lifting up his disk refulgent ,</l>
       <l n="102">Loud he shouted in derision ,</l>
       <l n="103">“ Esa ! esa ! shame upon you !</l>
       <l n="104">You are Ugudwash , the sun-fish ,</l>

       <l n="106">You are not the King of Fishes ! ”</l>
       <l n="107">Slowly downward , wavering , gleaming ,</l>
       <l n="108">Sank the Ugudwash , the sun-fish ,</l>
       <l n="109">And again the sturgeon , Nahma ,</l>
       <l n="110">Heard the shout of Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="111">Heard his challenge of defiance ,</l>
       <l n="112">The unnecessary tumult ,</l>
       <l n="113">Ringing far across the water .</l>
       <l n="114">From the white sand of the bottom</l>
       <l n="115">Up he rose with angry gesture ,</l>
       <l n="116">Quivering in each nerve and fibre ,</l>
       <l n="117">Clashing all his plates of armor ,</l>
       <l n="118">Gleaming bright with all his war-paint ;</l>
       <l n="119">In his wrath he darted upward ,</l>
       <l n="120">Flashing leaped into the sunshine ,</l>
       <l n="121">Opened his great jaws , and swallowed</l>
       <l n="122">Both canoe and Hiawatha .</l>
       <l n="123">Down into that darksome cavern</l>
       <l n="124">Plunged the headlong Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="125">As a log on some black river</l>
       <l n="126">Shoots and plunges down the rapids ,</l>
       <l n="127">Found himself in utter darkness ,</l>
       <l n="128">Groped about in helpless wonder ,</l>
       <l n="129">Till he felt a great heart beating ,</l>
       <l n="130">Throbbing in that utter darkness .</l>
       <l n="131">And he smote it in his anger ,</l>
       <l n="132">With his fist , the heart of Nahma ,</l>
       <l n="133">Felt the mighty King of Fishes</l>
       <l n="134">Shudder through each nerve and fibre ,</l>
       <l n="135">Heard the water gurgle round him</l>
       <l n="136">As he leaped and staggered through it ,</l>
       <l n="137">Sick at heart , and faint and weary .</l>
       <l n="138">Crosswise then did Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="139">Drag his birch-canoe for safety ,</l>
       <l n="140">Lest from out the jaws of Nahma ,</l>
       <l n="141">In the turmoil and confusion ,</l>
       <l n="142">Forth he might be hurled and perish .</l>
       <l n="143">And the squirrel , Adjidaumo ,</l>
       <l n="144">Frisked and chatted very gayly ,</l>
       <l n="145">Toiled and tugged with Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="146">Till the labor was completed .</l>
       <l n="147">Then said Hiawatha to him ,</l>
       <l n="148">“ O my little friend , the squirrel ,</l>
       <l n="149">Bravely have you toiled to help me ;</l>
       <l n="150">Take the thanks of Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="151">And the name which now he gives you ;</l>
       <l n="152">For hereafter and forever</l>
       <l n="153">Boys shall call you Adjidaumo ,</l>
       <l n="154">Tail-in-air the boys shall call you ! ”</l>
       <l n="155">And again the sturgeon , Nahma ,</l>
       <l n="156">Gasped and quivered in the water ,</l>
       <l n="157">Then was still , and drifted landward</l>
       <l n="158">Till he grated on the pebbles ,</l>
       <l n="159">Till the listening Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="160">Heard him grate upon the margin ,</l>
       <l n="161">Felt him strand upon the pebbles ,</l>
       <l n="162">Knew that Nahma , King of Fishes ,</l>
       <l n="163">Lay there dead upon the margin .</l>
       <l n="164">Then he heard a clang and flapping ,</l>
       <l n="165">As of many wings assembling ,</l>
       <l n="166">Heard a screaming and confusion ,</l>
       <l n="167">As of birds of prey contending ,</l>
       <l n="168">Saw a gleam of light above him ,</l>
       <l n="169">Shining through the ribs of Nahma ,</l>
       <l n="170">Saw the glittering eyes of sea-gulls ,</l>
       <l n="171">Of Kayoshk , the sea-gulls , peering ,</l>
       <l n="172">Gazing at him through the opening ,</l>
       <l n="173">Heard them saying to each other ,</l>
       <l n="174">“ ‘ T is our brother , Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="175">And he shouted from below them ,</l>
       <l n="176">Cried exulting from the caverns :</l>
       <l n="177">“ O ye sea-gulls ! O my brothers !</l>
       <l n="178">I have slain the sturgeon , Nahma ;</l>
       <l n="179">Make the rifts a little larger ,</l>
       <l n="180">With your claws the openings widen ,</l>
       <l n="181">Set me free from this dark prison ,</l>
       <l n="182">And henceforward and forever</l>
       <l n="183">Men shall speak of your achievements ,</l>
       <l n="184">Calling you Kayoshk , the sea-gulls ,</l>
       <l n="185">Yes , Kayoshk , the Noble Scratchers ! ”</l>
       <l n="186">And the wild and clamorous sea-gulls</l>
       <l n="187">Toiled with beak and claws together ,</l>
       <l n="188">Made the rifts and openings wider</l>
       <l n="189">In the mighty ribs of Nahma ,</l>
       <l n="190">And from peril and from prison ,</l>
       <l n="191">From the body of the sturgeon ,</l>
       <l n="192">From the peril of the water ,</l>
       <l n="193">They released my Hiawatha .</l>
       <l n="194">He was standing near his wigwam ,</l>
       <l n="195">On the margin of the water ,</l>
       <l n="196">And he called to old Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="197">Called and beckoned to Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="198">Pointed to the sturgeon , Nahma ,</l>
       <l n="199">Lying lifeless on the pebbles ,</l>
       <l n="200">With the sea-gulls feeding on him .</l>
       <l n="201">“ I have slain the Mishe-Nahma ,</l>
       <l n="202">Slain the King of Fishes ! ” said he ;</l>
       <l n="203">“ Look ! the sea-gulls feed upon him ,</l>
       <l n="204">Yes , my friends Kayoshk , the sea-gulls ;</l>
       <l n="205">Drive them not away , Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="206">They have saved me from great peril</l>
       <l n="207">In the body of the sturgeon ,</l>
       <l n="208">Wait until their meal is ended ,</l>
       <l n="209">Till their craws are full with feasting ,</l>
       <l n="210">Till they homeward fly , at sunset ,</l>
       <l n="211">To their nests among the marshes ;</l>
       <l n="212">Then bring all your pots and kettles ,</l>
       <l n="213">And make oil for us in Winter . ”</l>
       <l n="214">And she waited till the sun set ,</l>
       <l n="215">Till the pallid moon , the Night-sun ,</l>
       <l n="216">Rose above the tranquil water ,</l>
       <l n="217">Till Kayoshk , the sated sea-gulls ,</l>
       <l n="218">From their banquet rose with clamor ,</l>
       <l n="219">And across the fiery sunset</l>
       <l n="220">Winged their way to far-off islands ,</l>
       <l n="221">To their nests among the rushes .</l>
       <l n="222">To his sleep went Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="223">And Nokomis to her labor ,</l>
       <l n="224">Toiling patient in the moonlight ,</l>
       <l n="225">Till the sun and moon changed places ,</l>
       <l n="226">Till the sky was red with sunrise ,</l>
       <l n="227">And Kayoshk , the hungry sea-gulls ,</l>
       <l n="228">Came back from the reedy islands ,</l>
       <l n="229">Clamorous for their morning banquet .</l>
       <l n="230">Three whole days and nights alternate</l>
       <l n="231">Old Nokomis and the sea-gulls</l>
       <l n="232">Stripped the oily flesh of Nahma ,</l>
       <l n="233">Till the waves washed through the rib-bones ,</l>
       <l n="234">Till the sea-gulls came no longer ,</l>
       <l n="235">And upon the sands lay nothing</l>
       <l n="236">But the skeleton of Nahma .</l>

      <head>HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER</head>
       <l n="1">On the shores of Gitche Gumee ,</l>
       <l n="2">Of the shining Big-Sea-Water ,</l>
       <l n="3">Stood Nokomis , the old woman ,</l>
       <l n="4">Pointing with her finger westward ,</l>
       <l n="5">O'er the water pointing westward ,</l>
       <l n="6">To the purple clouds of sunset .</l>
       <l n="7">Fiercely the red sun descending</l>
       <l n="8">Burned his way along the heavens ,</l>
       <l n="9">Set the sky on fire behind him ,</l>
       <l n="10">As war-parties , when retreating ,</l>
       <l n="11">Burn the prairies on their war-trail ;</l>
       <l n="12">And the moon , the Night-sun , eastward ,</l>
       <l n="13">Suddenly starting from his ambush ,</l>
       <l n="14">Followed fast those bloody footprints ,</l>
       <l n="15">Followed in that fiery war-trail ,</l>
       <l n="16">With its glare upon his features .</l>
       <l n="17">And Nokomis , the old woman ,</l>
       <l n="18">Pointing with her finger westward ,</l>
       <l n="19">Spake these words to Hiawatha :</l>
       <l n="20">“ Yonder dwells the great Pearl-Feather ,</l>
       <l n="21">Megissogwon , the Magician ,</l>
       <l n="22">Manito of Wealth and Wampum ,</l>
       <l n="23">Guarded by his fiery serpents ,</l>
       <l n="24">Guarded by the black pitch-water .</l>
       <l n="25">You can see his fiery serpents ,</l>
       <l n="26">The Kenabeek , the great serpents ,</l>
       <l n="27">Coiling , playing in the water ;</l>
       <l n="28">You can see the black pitch-water</l>
       <l n="29">Stretching far away beyond them ,</l>
       <l n="30">To the purple clouds of sunset !</l>
       <l n="31">“ He it was who slew my father ,</l>
       <l n="32">By his wicked wiles and cunning ,</l>
       <l n="33">When he from the moon descended ,</l>
       <l n="34">When he came on earth to seek me .</l>
       <l n="35">He , the mightiest of Magicians ,</l>
       <l n="36">Sends the fever from the marshes ,</l>
       <l n="37">Sends the pestilential vapors ,</l>
       <l n="38">Sends the poisonous exhalations ,</l>
       <l n="39">Sends the white fog from the fen-lands ,</l>
       <l n="40">Sends disease and death among us !</l>
       <l n="41">“ Take your bow , O Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="42">Take your arrows , jasper-headed ,</l>
       <l n="43">Take your war-club , Puggawaugun ,</l>
       <l n="44">And your mittens , Minjekahwun ,</l>
       <l n="45">And your birch-canoe for sailing ,</l>
       <l n="46">And the oil of Mishe-Nahma ,</l>
       <l n="47">So to smear its sides , that swiftly</l>
       <l n="48">You may pass the black pitch-water ;</l>
       <l n="49">Slay this merciless magician ,</l>
       <l n="50">Save the people from the fever</l>
       <l n="51">That he breathes across the fen-lands ,</l>
       <l n="52">And avenge my father 's murder ! ”</l>
       <l n="53">Straightway then my Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="54">Armed himself with all his war-gear ,</l>
       <l n="55">Launched his birch-canoe for sailing ;</l>
       <l n="56">With his palm its sides he patted ,</l>
       <l n="57">Said with glee , “ Cheemaun , my darling ,</l>
       <l n="58">O my Birch-canoe ! leap forward ,</l>
       <l n="59">Where you see the fiery serpents ,</l>
       <l n="60">Where you see the black pitch-water ! ”</l>
       <l n="61">Forward leaped Cheemaun exulting ,</l>
       <l n="62">And the noble Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="63">Sang his war-song wild and woful ,</l>
       <l n="64">And above him the war-eagle ,</l>
       <l n="65">The Keneu , the great war-eagle ,</l>
       <l n="66">Master of all fowls with feathers ,</l>
       <l n="67">Screamed and hurtled through the heavens .</l>
       <l n="68">Soon he reached the fiery serpents ,</l>
       <l n="69">The Kenabeek , the great serpents ,</l>
       <l n="70">Lying huge upon the water ,</l>
       <l n="71">Sparkling , rippling in the water ,</l>
       <l n="72">Lying coiled across the passage ,</l>
       <l n="73">With their blazing crests uplifted ,</l>
       <l n="74">Breathing fiery fogs and vapors ,</l>
       <l n="75">So that none could pass beyond them .</l>
       <l n="76">But the fearless Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="77">Cried aloud , and spake in this wise :</l>
       <l n="78">“ Let me pass my way , Kenabeek ,</l>
       <l n="79">Let me go upon my journey ! ”</l>
       <l n="80">And they answered , hissing fiercely ,</l>
       <l n="81">With their fiery breath made answer :</l>
       <l n="82">“ Back , go back ! O Shaugodaya !</l>
       <l n="83">Back to old Nokomis , Faint-heart ! ”</l>
       <l n="84">Then the angry Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="85">Raised his mighty bow of ash-tree ,</l>
       <l n="86">Seized his arrows , jasper-headed ,</l>
       <l n="87">Shot them fast among the serpents ;</l>
       <l n="88">Every twanging of the bow-string</l>
       <l n="89">Was a war-cry and a death-cry ,</l>
       <l n="90">Every whizzing of an arrow</l>
       <l n="91">Was a death-song of Kenabeek .</l>
       <l n="92">Weltering in the bloody water ,</l>
       <l n="93">Dead lay all the fiery serpents ,</l>
       <l n="94">And among them Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="95">Harmless sailed , and cried exulting :</l>
       <l n="96">“ Onward , O Cheemaun , my darling !</l>
       <l n="97">Onward to the black pitch-water ! ”</l>
       <l n="98">Then he took the oil of Nahma ,</l>
       <l n="99">And the bows and sides anointed ,</l>
       <l n="100">Smeared them well with oil , that swiftly</l>
       <l n="101">He might pass the black pitch-water .</l>
       <l n="102">All night long he sailed upon it ,</l>
       <l n="103">Sailed upon that sluggish water ,</l>
       <l n="104">Covered with its mould of ages ,</l>
       <l n="105">Black with rotting water-rushes ,</l>
       <l n="106">Rank with flags and leaves of lilies ,</l>
       <l n="107">Stagnant , lifeless , dreary , dismal ,</l>
       <l n="108">Lighted by the shimmering moonlight ,</l>
       <l n="109">And by will-o ’ - the-wisps illumined ,</l>
       <l n="110">Fires by ghosts of dead men kindled ,</l>
       <l n="111">In their weary night-encampments .</l>
       <l n="112">All the air was white with moonlight ,</l>
       <l n="113">All the water black with shadow ,</l>
       <l n="114">And around him the Suggema ,</l>
       <l n="115">The mosquito , sang his war-song ,</l>
       <l n="116">And the fire-flies , Wah-wah-taysee ,</l>
       <l n="117">Waved their torches to mislead him ;</l>
       <l n="118">And the bull-frog , the Dahinda ,</l>
       <l n="119">Thrust his head into the moonlight ,</l>
       <l n="120">Fixed his yellow eyes upon him ,</l>
       <l n="121">Sobbed and sank beneath the surface ;</l>
       <l n="122">And anon a thousand whistles ,</l>
       <l n="123">Answered over all the fen-lands ,</l>
       <l n="124">And the heron , the Shuh-shuh-gah ,</l>
       <l n="125">Far off on the reedy margin ,</l>
       <l n="126">Heralded the hero 's coming .</l>
       <l n="127">Westward thus fared Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="128">Toward the realm of Megissogwon ,</l>
       <l n="129">Toward the land of the Pearl-Feather ,</l>
       <l n="130">Till the level moon stared at him ,</l>
       <l n="131">In his face stared pale and haggard ,</l>
       <l n="132">Till the sun was hot behind him ,</l>
       <l n="133">Till it burned upon his shoulders ,</l>
       <l n="134">And before him on the upland</l>
       <l n="135">He could see the Shining Wigwam</l>
       <l n="136">Of the Manito of Wampum ,</l>
       <l n="137">Of the mightiest of Magicians .</l>
       <l n="138">Then once more Cheemaun he patted ,</l>
       <l n="139">To his birch-canoe said , “ Onward ! ”</l>
       <l n="140">And it stirred in all its fibres ,</l>
       <l n="141">And with one great bound of triumph</l>
       <l n="142">Leaped across the water-lilies ,</l>
       <l n="143">Leaped through tangled flags and rushes ,</l>
       <l n="144">And upon the beach beyond them</l>
       <l n="145">Dry-shod landed Hiawatha .</l>
       <l n="146">Straight he took his bow of ash-tree ,</l>
       <l n="147">On the sand one end he rested ,</l>
       <l n="148">With his knee he pressed the middle ,</l>
       <l n="149">Stretched the faithful bow-string tighter ,</l>
       <l n="150">Took an arrow , jasper-headed ,</l>
       <l n="151">Shot it at the Shining Wigwam ,</l>
       <l n="152">Sent it singing as a herald ,</l>
       <l n="153">As a bearer of his message ,</l>
       <l n="154">Of his challenge loud and lofty :</l>
       <l n="155">“ Come forth from your lodge , Pearl-Feather !</l>
       <l n="156">Hiawatha waits your coming ! ”</l>
       <l n="157">Straightway from the Shining Wigwam</l>
       <l n="158">Came the mighty Megissogwon ,</l>
       <l n="159">Tall of stature , broad of shoulder ,</l>
       <l n="160">Dark and terrible in aspect ,</l>
       <l n="161">Clad from head to foot in wampum ,</l>
       <l n="162">Armed with all his warlike weapons ,</l>
       <l n="163">Painted like the sky of morning ,</l>
       <l n="164">Streaked with crimson , blue , and yellow ,</l>
       <l n="165">Crested with great eagle-feathers ,</l>
       <l n="166">Streaming upward , streaming outward .</l>
       <l n="167">“ Well I know you , Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="168">Cried he in a voice of thunder ,</l>
       <l n="169">In a tone of loud derision .</l>
       <l n="170">“ Hasten back , O Shaugodaya !</l>
       <l n="171">Hasten back among the women ,</l>
       <l n="172">Back to old Nokomis , Faint-heart !</l>
       <l n="173">I will slay you as you stand there ,</l>
       <l n="174">As of old I slew her father ! ”</l>
       <l n="175">But my Hiawatha answered ,</l>
       <l n="176">Nothing daunted , fearing nothing :</l>
       <l n="177">“ Big words do not smite like war-clubs ,</l>
       <l n="178">Boastful breath is not a bow-string ,</l>
       <l n="179">Taunts are not so sharp as arrows ,</l>
       <l n="180">Deeds are better things than words are ,</l>
       <l n="181">Actions mightier than boastings ! ”</l>
       <l n="182">Then began the greatest battle</l>
       <l n="183">That the sun had ever looked on ,</l>
       <l n="184">That the war-birds ever witnessed .</l>
       <l n="185">All a Summer 's day it lasted ,</l>
       <l n="186">From the sunrise to the sunset ;</l>
       <l n="187">For the shafts of Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="188">Harmless hit the shirt of wampum ,</l>
       <l n="189">Harmless fell the blows he dealt it</l>
       <l n="190">With his mittens , Minjekahwun ,</l>
       <l n="191">Harmless fell the heavy war-club ;</l>
       <l n="192">It could dash the rocks asunder ,</l>
       <l n="193">But it could not break the meshes</l>
       <l n="194">Of that magic shirt of wampum .</l>
       <l n="195">Till at sunset Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="196">Leaning on his bow of ash-tree ,</l>
       <l n="197">Wounded , weary , and desponding ,</l>
       <l n="198">With his mighty war-club broken ,</l>
       <l n="199">With his mittens torn and tattered ,</l>
       <l n="200">And three useless arrows only ,</l>
       <l n="201">Paused to rest beneath a pine-tree ,</l>
       <l n="202">From whose branches trailed the mosses ,</l>
       <l n="203">And whose trunk was coated over</l>
       <l n="204">With the Dead-man 's Moccasin-leather ,</l>
       <l n="205">With the fungus white and yellow .</l>
       <l n="206">Suddenly from the boughs above him</l>
       <l n="207">Sang the Mama , the woodpecker :</l>
       <l n="208">“ Aim your arrows , Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="209">At the head of Megissogwon ,</l>
       <l n="210">Strike the tuft of hair upon it ,</l>
       <l n="211">At their roots the long black tresses ;</l>
       <l n="212">There alone can he be wounded ! ”</l>
       <l n="213">Winged with feathers , tipped with jasper ,</l>
       <l n="214">Swift flew Hiawatha 's arrow ,</l>
       <l n="215">Just as Megissogwon , stooping ,</l>
       <l n="216">Raised a heavy stone to throw it .</l>
       <l n="217">Full upon the crown it struck him ,</l>
       <l n="218">At the roots of his long tresses ,</l>
       <l n="219">And he reeled and staggered forward ,</l>
       <l n="220">Plunging like a wounded bison ,</l>
       <l n="221">Yes , like Pezhekee , the bison ,</l>
       <l n="222">When the snow is on the prairie .</l>
       <l n="223">Swifter flew the second arrow ,</l>
       <l n="224">In the pathway of the other ,</l>
       <l n="225">Piercing deeper than the other ,</l>
       <l n="226">Wounding sorer than the other ;</l>
       <l n="227">And the knees of Megissogwon</l>
       <l n="228">Shook like windy reeds beneath him ,</l>
       <l n="229">Bent and trembled like the rushes .</l>
       <l n="230">But the third and latest arrow</l>
       <l n="231">Swiftest flew , and wounded sorest ,</l>
       <l n="232">And the mighty Megissogwon</l>
       <l n="233">Saw the fiery eyes of Pauguk ,</l>
       <l n="234">Saw the eyes of Death glare at him ,</l>
       <l n="235">Heard his voice call in the darkness ;</l>
       <l n="236">At the feet of Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="237">Lifeless lay the great Pearl-Feather ,</l>
       <l n="238">Lay the mightiest of Magicians .</l>
       <l n="239">Then the grateful Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="240">Called the Mama , the woodpecker ,</l>
       <l n="241">From his perch among the branches</l>
       <l n="242">Of the melancholy pine-tree ,</l>
       <l n="243">And , in honor of his service ,</l>
       <l n="244">Stained with blood the tuft of feathers</l>
       <l n="245">On the little head of Mama ;</l>
       <l n="246">Even to this day he wears it ,</l>
       <l n="247">Wears the tuft of crimson feathers ,</l>
       <l n="248">As a symbol of his service .</l>
       <l n="249">Then he stripped the shirt of wampum</l>
       <l n="250">From the back of Megissogwon ,</l>
       <l n="251">As a trophy of the battle ,</l>
       <l n="252">As a signal of his conquest .</l>
       <l n="253">On the shore he left the body ,</l>
       <l n="254">Half on land and half in water ,</l>
       <l n="255">In the sand his feet were buried ,</l>
       <l n="256">And his face was in the water .</l>
       <l n="257">And above him , wheeled and clamored</l>
       <l n="258">The Keneu , the great war-eagle ,</l>
       <l n="259">Sailing round in narrower circles ,</l>
       <l n="260">Hovering nearer , nearer , nearer .</l>
       <l n="261">From the wigwam Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="262">Bore the wealth of Megissogwon ,</l>
       <l n="263">All his wealth of skins and wampum ,</l>
       <l n="264">Furs of bison and of beaver ,</l>
       <l n="265">Furs of sable and of ermine ,</l>
       <l n="266">Wampum belts and strings and pouches ,</l>
       <l n="267">Quivers wrought with beads of wampum ,</l>
       <l n="268">Filled with arrows , silver-headed .</l>
       <l n="269">Homeward then he sailed exulting ,</l>
       <l n="270">Homeward through the black pitch-water ,</l>
       <l n="271">Homeward through the weltering serpents ,</l>
       <l n="272">With the trophies of the battle ,</l>
       <l n="273">With a shout and song of triumph .</l>
       <l n="274">On the shore stood old Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="275">On the shore stood Chibiabos ,</l>
       <l n="276">And the very strong man , Kwasind ,</l>
       <l n="277">Waiting for the hero 's coming ,</l>
       <l n="278">Listening to his songs of triumph .</l>
       <l n="279">And the people of the village</l>
       <l n="280">Welcomed him with songs and dances ,</l>
       <l n="281">Made a joyous feast , and shouted :</l>
       <l n="282">“ Honor be to Hiawatha !</l>
       <l n="283">He has slain the great Pearl-Feather ,</l>
       <l n="284">Slain the mightiest of Magicians ,</l>
       <l n="285">Him , who sent the fiery fever ,</l>
       <l n="286">Sent the white fog from the fen-lands ,</l>
       <l n="287">Sent disease and death among us ! ”</l>
       <l n="288">Ever dear to Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="289">Was the memory of Mama !</l>
       <l n="290">And in token of his friendship ,</l>
       <l n="291">As a mark of his remembrance ,</l>
       <l n="292">He adorned and decked his pipe-stem</l>
       <l n="293">With the crimson tuft of feathers ,</l>
       <l n="294">With the blood-red crest of Mama .</l>
       <l n="295">But the wealth of Megissogwon ,</l>
       <l n="296">All the trophies of the battle ,</l>
       <l n="297">He divided with his people ,</l>
       <l n="298">Shared it equally among them .</l>

      <head>HIAWATHA 'S WOOING</head>
       <l n="1">“ As unto the bow the cord is ,</l>
       <l n="2">So unto the man is woman ;</l>
       <l n="3">Though she bends him , she obeys him ,</l>
       <l n="4">Though she draws him , yet she follows ,</l>
       <l n="5">Useless each without the other ! ”</l>
       <l n="6">Thus the youthful Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="7">Said within himself and pondered ,</l>
       <l n="8">Much perplexed by various feelings ,</l>
       <l n="9">Listless , longing , hoping , fearing ,</l>
       <l n="10">Dreaming still of Minnehaha ,</l>
       <l n="11">Of the lovely Laughing Water ,</l>
       <l n="12">In the land of the Dacotahs .</l>
       <l n="13">“ Wed a maiden of your people , ”</l>
       <l n="14">Warning said the old Nokomis ;</l>
       <l n="15">“ Go not eastward , go not westward ,</l>
       <l n="16">For a stranger , whom we know not !</l>
       <l n="17">Like a fire upon the hearth-stone</l>
       <l n="18">Is a neighbor 's homely daughter ,</l>
       <l n="19">Like the starlight or the moonlight</l>
       <l n="20">Is the handsomest of strangers ! ”</l>
       <l n="21">Thus dissuading spake Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="22">And my Hiawatha answered</l>
       <l n="23">Only this : “ Dear old Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="24">Very pleasant is the firelight ,</l>
       <l n="25">But I like the starlight better ,</l>
       <l n="26">Better do I like the moonlight ! ”</l>
       <l n="27">Gravely then said old Nokomis :</l>
       <l n="28">“ Bring not here an idle maiden ,</l>
       <l n="29">Bring not here a useless woman ,</l>
       <l n="30">Hands unskilful , feet unwilling ;</l>
       <l n="31">Bring a wife with nimble fingers ,</l>
       <l n="32">Heart and hand that move together ,</l>
       <l n="33">Feet that run on willing errands ! ”</l>
       <l n="34">Smiling answered Hiawatha :</l>
       <l n="35">“ In the land of the Dacotahs</l>
       <l n="36">Lives the Arrow-maker 's daughter ,</l>
       <l n="37">Minnehaha , Laughing Water ,</l>
       <l n="38">Handsomest of all the women .</l>
       <l n="39">I will bring her to your wigwam ,</l>
       <l n="40">She shall run upon your errands ,</l>
       <l n="41">Be your starlight , moonlight , firelight ,</l>
       <l n="42">Be the sunlight of my people ! ”</l>
       <l n="43">Still dissuading said Nokomis :</l>
       <l n="44">“ Bring not to my lodge a stranger</l>
       <l n="45">From the land of the Dacotahs !</l>
       <l n="46">Very fierce are the Dacotahs ,</l>
       <l n="47">Often is there war between us ,</l>
       <l n="48">There are feuds yet unforgotten ,</l>
       <l n="49">Wounds that ache and still may open ! ”</l>
       <l n="50">Laughing answered Hiawatha :</l>
       <l n="51">“ For that reason , if no other ,</l>
       <l n="52">Would I wed the fair Dacotah ,</l>
       <l n="53">That our tribes might be united ,</l>
       <l n="54">That old feuds might be forgotten ,</l>
       <l n="55">And old wounds be healed forever ! ”</l>
       <l n="56">Thus departed Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="57">To the land of the Dacotahs ,</l>
       <l n="58">To the land of handsome women ;</l>
       <l n="59">Striding over moor and meadow ,</l>
       <l n="60">Through interminable forests ,</l>
       <l n="61">Through uninterrupted silence .</l>
       <l n="62">With his moccasins of magic ,</l>
       <l n="63">At each stride a mile he measured ;</l>
       <l n="64">Yet the way seemed long before him ,</l>
       <l n="65">And his heart outran his footsteps ;</l>
       <l n="66">And he journeyed without resting ,</l>
       <l n="67">Till he heard the cataract 's laughter ,</l>
       <l n="68">Heard the Falls of Minnehaha</l>
       <l n="69">Calling to him through the silence .</l>
       <l n="70">“ Pleasant is the sound ! ” he murmured ,</l>
       <l n="71">“ Pleasant is the voice that calls me ! ”</l>
       <l n="72">On the outskirts of the forests ,</l>
       <l n="73">‘ Twixt the shadow and the sunshine ,</l>
       <l n="74">Herds of fallow deer were feeding ,</l>
       <l n="75">But they saw not Hiawatha ;</l>
       <l n="76">To his bow he whispered , “ Fail not ! ”</l>
       <l n="77">To his arrow whispered , “ Swerve not ! ”</l>
       <l n="78">Sent it singing on its errand ,</l>
       <l n="79">To the red heart of the roebuck ;</l>
       <l n="80">Threw the deer across his shoulder ,</l>
       <l n="81">And sped forward without pausing .</l>
       <l n="82">At the doorway of his wigwam</l>
       <l n="83">Sat the ancient Arrow-maker ,</l>
       <l n="84">In the land of the Dacotahs ,</l>
       <l n="85">Making arrow-heads of jasper ,</l>
       <l n="86">Arrow-heads of chalcedony .</l>
       <l n="87">At his side , in all her beauty ,</l>
       <l n="88">Sat the lovely Minnehaha ,</l>
       <l n="89">Sat his daughter , Laughing Water ,</l>
       <l n="90">Plaiting mats of flags and rushes</l>
       <l n="91">Of the past the old man 's thoughts were ,</l>
       <l n="92">And the maiden 's of the future .</l>
       <l n="93">He was thinking , as he sat there ,</l>
       <l n="94">Of the days when with such arrows</l>
       <l n="95">He had struck the deer and bison ,</l>
       <l n="96">On the Muskoday , the meadow ;</l>
       <l n="97">Shot the wild goose , flying southward</l>
       <l n="98">On the wing , the clamorous Wawa ;</l>
       <l n="99">Thinking of the great war-parties ,</l>
       <l n="100">How they came to buy his arrows ,</l>
       <l n="101">Could not fight without his arrows .</l>
       <l n="102">Ah , no more such noble warriors</l>
       <l n="103">Could be found on earth as they were !</l>
       <l n="104">Now the men were all like women ,</l>
       <l n="105">Only used their tongues for weapons !</l>
       <l n="106">She was thinking of a hunter ,</l>
       <l n="107">From another tribe and country ,</l>
       <l n="108">Young and tall and very handsome ,</l>
       <l n="109">Who one morning , in the Spring-time ,</l>
       <l n="110">Came to buy her father 's arrows ,</l>
       <l n="111">Sat and rested in the wigwam ,</l>
       <l n="112">Lingered long about the doorway ,</l>
       <l n="113">Looking back as he departed .</l>
       <l n="114">She had heard her father praise him ,</l>
       <l n="115">Praise his courage and his wisdom ;</l>
       <l n="116">Would he come again for arrows</l>
       <l n="117">To the Falls of Minnehaha ?</l>
       <l n="118">On the mat her hands lay idle ,</l>
       <l n="119">And her eyes were very dreamy .</l>
       <l n="120">Through their thoughts they heard a footstep ,</l>
       <l n="121">Heard a rustling in the branches ,</l>
       <l n="122">And with glowing cheek and forehead ,</l>
       <l n="123">With the deer upon his shoulders ,</l>
       <l n="124">Suddenly from out the woodlands</l>
       <l n="125">Hiawatha stood before them .</l>
       <l n="126">Straight the ancient Arrow-maker</l>
       <l n="127">Looked up gravely from his labor ,</l>
       <l n="128">Laid aside the unfinished arrow ,</l>
       <l n="129">Bade him enter at the doorway ,</l>
       <l n="130">Saying , as he rose to meet him ,</l>
       <l n="131">‘ Hiawatha , you are welcome ! ”</l>
       <l n="132">At the feet of Laughing Water</l>
       <l n="133">Hiawatha laid his burden ,</l>
       <l n="134">Threw the red deer from his shoulders ;</l>
       <l n="135">And the maiden looked up at him ,</l>
       <l n="136">Looked up from her mat of rushes ,</l>
       <l n="137">Said with gentle look and accent ,</l>
       <l n="138">“ You are welcome , Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="139">Very spacious was the wigwam ,</l>
       <l n="140">Made of deer-skins dressed and whitened ,</l>
       <l n="141">With the Gods of the Dacotahs</l>
       <l n="142">Drawn and painted on its curtains ,</l>
       <l n="143">And so tall the doorway , hardly</l>
       <l n="144">Hiawatha stooped to enter ,</l>
       <l n="145">Hardly touched his eagle-feathers</l>
       <l n="146">As he entered at the doorway .</l>
       <l n="147">Then uprose the Laughing Water ,</l>
       <l n="148">From the ground fair Minnehaha ,</l>
       <l n="149">Laid aside her mat unfinished ,</l>
       <l n="150">Brought forth food and set before them ,</l>
       <l n="151">Water brought them from the brooklet ,</l>
       <l n="152">Gave them food in earthen vessels ,</l>
       <l n="153">Gave them drink in bowls of bass-wood ,</l>
       <l n="154">Listened while the guest was speaking ,</l>
       <l n="155">Listened while her father answered ,</l>
       <l n="156">But not once her lips she opened ,</l>
       <l n="157">Not a single word she uttered .</l>
       <l n="158">Yes , as in a dream she listened</l>
       <l n="159">To the words of Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="160">As he talked of old Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="161">Who had nursed him in his childhood ,</l>
       <l n="162">As he told of his companions ,</l>
       <l n="163">Chibiabos , the musician ,</l>
       <l n="164">And the very strong man , Kwasind ,</l>
       <l n="165">And of happiness and plenty</l>
       <l n="166">In the land of the Ojibways ,</l>
       <l n="167">In the pleasant land and peaceful .</l>
       <l n="168">“ After many years of warfare ,</l>
       <l n="169">Many years of strife and bloodshed ,</l>
       <l n="170">There is peace between the Ojibways</l>
       <l n="171">And the tribe of the Dacotahs . ”</l>
       <l n="172">Thus continued Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="173">And then added , speaking slowly ,</l>
       <l n="174">“ That this peace may last forever ,</l>
       <l n="175">And our hands be clasped more closely ,</l>
       <l n="176">And our hearts be more united ,</l>
       <l n="177">Give me as my wife this maiden ,</l>
       <l n="178">Minnehaha , Laughing Water ,</l>
       <l n="179">Loveliest of Dacotah women ! ”</l>
       <l n="180">And the ancient Arrow-maker</l>
       <l n="181">Paused a moment ere he answered ,</l>
       <l n="182">Smoked a little while in silence ,</l>
       <l n="183">Looked at Hiawatha proudly ,</l>
       <l n="184">Fondly looked at Laughing Water ,</l>
       <l n="185">And made answer very gravely :</l>
       <l n="186">“ Yes , if Minnehaha wishes ;</l>
       <l n="187">Let your heart speak , Minnehaha ! ”</l>
       <l n="188">And the lovely Laughing Water</l>
       <l n="189">Seemed more lovely as she stood there ,</l>
       <l n="190">Neither willing nor reluctant ,</l>
       <l n="191">As she went to Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="192">Softly took the seat beside him ,</l>
       <l n="193">While she said , and blushed to say it ,</l>
       <l n="194">“ I will follow you , my husband ! ”</l>
       <l n="195">This was Hiawatha 's wooing !</l>
       <l n="196">Thus it was he won the daughter</l>
       <l n="197">Of the ancient Arrow-maker ,</l>
       <l n="198">In the land of the Dacotahs !</l>
       <l n="199">From the wigwam he departed ,</l>
       <l n="200">Leading with him Laughing Water ;</l>
       <l n="201">Hand in hand they went together ,</l>
       <l n="202">Through the woodland and the meadow ,</l>
       <l n="203">Left the old man standing lonely</l>
       <l n="204">At the doorway of his wigwam ,</l>
       <l n="205">Heard the Falls of Minnehaha</l>
       <l n="206">Calling to them from the distance ,</l>
       <l n="207">Crying to them from afar off ,</l>
       <l n="208">“ Fare thee well , O Minnehaha ! ”</l>
       <l n="209">And the ancient Arrow-maker</l>
       <l n="210">Turned again unto his labor ,</l>
       <l n="211">Sat down by his sunny doorway ,</l>
       <l n="212">Murmuring to himself , and saying :</l>
       <l n="213">“ Thus it is our daughters leave us ,</l>
       <l n="214">Those we love , and those who love us !</l>
       <l n="215">Just when they have learned to help us ,</l>
       <l n="216">When we are old and lean upon them ,</l>
       <l n="217">Comes a youth with flaunting feathers ,</l>
       <l n="218">With his flute of reeds , a stranger</l>
       <l n="219">Wanders piping through the village ,</l>
       <l n="220">Beckons to the fairest maiden ,</l>
       <l n="221">And she follows where he leads her ,</l>
       <l n="222">Leaving all things for the stranger ! ”</l>
       <l n="223">Pleasant was the journey homeward ,</l>
       <l n="224">Through interminable forests ,</l>
       <l n="225">Over meadow , over mountain ,</l>
       <l n="226">Over river , hill , and hollow .</l>
       <l n="227">Short it seemed to Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="228">Though they journeyed very slowly ,</l>
       <l n="229">Though his pace he checked and slackened</l>
       <l n="230">To the steps of Laughing Water .</l>
       <l n="231">Over wide and rushing rivers</l>
       <l n="232">In his arms he bore the maiden ;</l>
       <l n="233">Light he thought her as a feather ,</l>
       <l n="234">As the plume upon his head-gear ;</l>
       <l n="235">Cleared the tangled pathway for her ,</l>
       <l n="236">Bent aside the swaying branches ,</l>
       <l n="237">Made at night a lodge of branches ,</l>
       <l n="238">And a bed with boughs of hemlock ,</l>
       <l n="239">And a fire before the doorway</l>
       <l n="240">With the dry cones of the pine-tree .</l>
       <l n="241">All the travelling winds went with them ,</l>
       <l n="242">O'er the meadows , through the forest ;</l>
       <l n="243">All the stars of night looked at them ,</l>
       <l n="244">Watched with sleepless eyes their slumber ;</l>
       <l n="245">From his ambush in the oak-tree</l>
       <l n="246">Peeped the squirrel , Adjidaumo ,</l>
       <l n="247">Watched with eager eyes the lovers ;</l>
       <l n="248">And the rabbit , the Wabasso ,</l>
       <l n="249">Scampered from the path before them ,</l>
       <l n="250">Peering , peeping from his burrow ,</l>
       <l n="251">Sat erect upon his haunches ,</l>
       <l n="252">Watched with curious eyes the lovers .</l>
       <l n="253">Pleasant was the journey homeward !</l>
       <l n="254">All the birds sang loud and sweetly</l>
       <l n="255">Songs of happiness and heart'shYpppHeNease ;</l>
       <l n="256">Sang the bluebird , the Owaissa ,</l>
       <l n="257">“ Happy are you , Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="258">Having such a wife to love you ! ”</l>
       <l n="259">Sang the robin , the Opechee ,</l>
       <l n="260">“ Happy are you , Laughing Water ,</l>
       <l n="261">Having such a noble husband ! ”</l>
       <l n="262">From the sky the sun benignant</l>
       <l n="263">Looked upon them through the branches ,</l>
       <l n="264">Saying to them , “ O my children ,</l>
       <l n="265">Love is sunshine , hate is shadow ,</l>
       <l n="266">Life is checkered shade and sunshine ,</l>
       <l n="267">Rule by love , O Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="268">From the sky the moon looked at them ,</l>
       <l n="269">Filled the lodge with mystic splendors ,</l>
       <l n="270">Whispered to them , “ O my children ,</l>
       <l n="271">Day is restless , night is quiet ,</l>
       <l n="272">Man imperious , woman feeble ;</l>
       <l n="273">Half is mine , although I follow ;</l>
       <l n="274">Rule by patience , Laughing Water ! ”</l>
       <l n="275">Thus it was they journeyed homeward ;</l>
       <l n="276">Thus it was that Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="277">To the lodge of old Nokomis</l>
       <l n="278">Brought the moonlight , starlight , firelight ,</l>
       <l n="279">Brought the sunshine of his people ,</l>
       <l n="280">Minnehaha , Laughing Water ,</l>
       <l n="281">Handsomest of all the women</l>
       <l n="282">In the land of the Dacotahs ,</l>
       <l n="283">In the land of handsome women .</l>

      <head>HIAWATHA 'S WEDDING-FEAST</head>
       <l n="1">You shall hear how Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="2">How the handsome Yenadizze</l>
       <l n="3">Danced at Hiawatha 's wedding ;</l>
       <l n="4">How the gentle Chibiabos ,</l>
       <l n="5">He the sweetest of musicians ,</l>
       <l n="6">Sang his songs of love and longing ;</l>
       <l n="7">How Iagoo , the great boaster ,</l>
       <l n="8">He the marvellous story-teller ,</l>
       <l n="9">Told his tales of strange adventure ,</l>
       <l n="10">That the feast might be more joyous ,</l>
       <l n="11">That the time might pass more gayly ,</l>
       <l n="12">And the guests be more contented .</l>
       <l n="13">Sumptuous was the feast Nokomis</l>
       <l n="14">Made at Hiawatha 's wedding ;</l>
       <l n="15">All the bowls were made of bass-wood ,</l>
       <l n="16">White and polished very smoothly ,</l>
       <l n="17">All the spoons of horn of bison ,</l>
       <l n="18">Black and polished very smoothly .</l>
       <l n="19">She had sent through all the village</l>
       <l n="20">Messengers with wands of willow ,</l>
       <l n="21">As a sign of invitation ,</l>
       <l n="22">As a token of the feasting ;</l>
       <l n="23">And the wedding guests assembled ,</l>
       <l n="24">Clad in all their richest raiment ,</l>
       <l n="25">Robes of fur and belts of wampum ,</l>
       <l n="26">Splendid with their paint and plumage ,</l>
       <l n="27">Beautiful with beads and tassels .</l>
       <l n="28">First they ate the sturgeon , Nahma ,</l>
       <l n="29">And the pike , the Maskenozha ,</l>
       <l n="30">Caught and cooked by old Nokomis ;</l>
       <l n="31">Then on pemican they feasted ,</l>
       <l n="32">Pemican and buffalo marrow ,</l>
       <l n="33">Haunch of deer and hump of bison ,</l>
       <l n="34">Yellow cakes of the Mondamin ,</l>
       <l n="35">And the wild rice of the river .</l>
       <l n="36">But the gracious Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="37">And the lovely Laughing Water ,</l>
       <l n="38">And the careful old Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="39">Tasted not the food before them ,</l>
       <l n="40">Only waited on the others</l>
       <l n="41">Only served their guests in silence .</l>
       <l n="42">And when all the guests had finished ,</l>
       <l n="43">Old Nokomis , brisk and busy ,</l>
       <l n="44">From an ample pouch of otter ,</l>
       <l n="45">Filled the red-stone pipes for smoking</l>
       <l n="46">With tobacco from the South-land ,</l>
       <l n="47">Mixed with bark of the red willow ,</l>
       <l n="48">And with herbs and leaves of fragrance .</l>
       <l n="49">Then she said , “ O Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="50">Dance for us your merry dances ,</l>
       <l n="51">Dance the Beggar 's Dance to please us ,</l>
       <l n="52">That the feast may be more joyous ,</l>
       <l n="53">That the time may pass more gayly ,</l>
       <l n="54">And our guests be more contented ! ”</l>
       <l n="55">Then the handsome Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="56">He the idle Yenadizze ,</l>
       <l n="57">He the merry mischief-maker ,</l>
       <l n="58">Whom the people called the Storm-Fool ,</l>
       <l n="59">Rose among the guests assembled .</l>
       <l n="60">Skilled was he in sports and pastimes ,</l>
       <l n="61">In the merry dance of snow-shoes ,</l>
       <l n="62">In the play of quoits and ball-play ;</l>
       <l n="63">Skilled was he in games of hazard ,</l>
       <l n="64">In all games of skill and hazard ,</l>
       <l n="65">Pugasaing , the Bowl and Counters ,</l>
       <l n="66">Kuntassoo , the Game of Plum-stones .</l>
       <l n="67">Though the warriors called him Faint-Heart ,</l>
       <l n="68">Called him coward , Shaugodaya ,</l>
       <l n="69">Idler , gambler , Yenadizze ,</l>
       <l n="70">Little heeded he their jesting ,</l>
       <l n="71">Little cared he for their insults ,</l>
       <l n="72">For the women and the maidens</l>
       <l n="73">Loved the handsome Pau-Puk-Keewis .</l>
       <l n="74">He was dressed in shirt of doeskin ,</l>
       <l n="75">White and soft , and fringed with ermine ,</l>
       <l n="76">All inwrought with beads of wampum ;</l>
       <l n="77">He was dressed in deer-skin leggings ,</l>
       <l n="78">Fringed with hedgehog quills and ermine ,</l>
       <l n="79">And in moccasins of buck-skin ,</l>
       <l n="80">Thick with quills and beads embroidered .</l>
       <l n="81">On his head were plumes of swan 's down ,</l>
       <l n="82">On his heels were tails of foxes ,</l>
       <l n="83">In one hand a fan of feathers ,</l>
       <l n="84">And a pipe was in the other .</l>
       <l n="85">Barred with streaks of red and yellow ,</l>
       <l n="86">Streaks of blue and bright vermilion ,</l>
       <l n="87">Shone the face of Pau-Puk-Keewis .</l>
       <l n="88">From his forehead fell his tresses ,</l>
       <l n="89">Smooth , and parted like a woman 's ,</l>
       <l n="90">Shining bright with oil , and plaited ,</l>
       <l n="91">Hung with braids of scented grasses ,</l>
       <l n="92">As among the guests assembled ,</l>
       <l n="93">To the sound of flutes and singing ,</l>
       <l n="94">To the sound of drums and voices ,</l>
       <l n="95">Rose the handsome Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="96">And began his mystic dances .</l>
       <l n="97">First he danced a solemn measure ,</l>
       <l n="98">Very slow in step and gesture ,</l>
       <l n="99">In and out among the pine-trees ,</l>
       <l n="100">Through the shadows and the sunshine ,</l>
       <l n="101">Treading softly like a panther .</l>
       <l n="102">Then more swiftly and still swifter ,</l>
       <l n="103">Whirling , spinning round in circles ,</l>
       <l n="104">Leaping o'er the guests assembled ,</l>
       <l n="105">Eddying round and round the wigwam ,</l>
       <l n="106">Till the leaves went whirling with him ,</l>
       <l n="107">Till the dust and wind together</l>
       <l n="108">Swept in eddies round about him .</l>
       <l n="109">Then along the sandy margin</l>
       <l n="110">Of the lake , the Big-Sea-Water ,</l>
       <l n="111">On he sped with frenzied gestures ,</l>
       <l n="112">Stamped upon the sand , and tossed it</l>
       <l n="113">Wildly in the air around him ;</l>
       <l n="114">Till the wind became a whirlwind ,</l>
       <l n="115">Till the sand was blown and sifted</l>
       <l n="116">Like great snowdrifts o'er the landscape ,</l>
       <l n="117">Heaping all the shores with Sand Dunes ,</l>
       <l n="118">Sand Hills of the Nagow Wudjoo !</l>
       <l n="119">Thus the merry Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
       <l n="120">Danced his Beggar 's Dance to please them ,</l>
       <l n="121">And , returning , sat down laughing</l>
       <l n="122">There among the guests assembled ,</l>
       <l n="123">Sat and fanned himself serenely</l>
       <l n="124">With his fan of turkey-feathers .</l>
       <l n="125">Then they said to Chibiabos ,</l>
       <l n="126">To the friend of Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="127">To the sweetest of all singers ,</l>
       <l n="128">To the best of all musicians ,</l>
       <l n="129">“ Sing to us , O Chibiabos !</l>
       <l n="130">Songs of love and songs of longing ,</l>
       <l n="131">That the feast may be more joyous ,</l>
       <l n="132">That the time may pass more gayly ,</l>
       <l n="133">And our guests be more contented ! ”</l>
       <l n="134">And the gentle Chibiabos</l>
       <l n="135">Sang in accents sweet and tender ,</l>
       <l n="136">Sang in tones of deep emotion ,</l>
       <l n="137">Songs of love and songs of longing ;</l>
       <l n="138">Looking still at Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="139">Looking at fair Laughing Water ,</l>
       <l n="140">Sang he softly , sang in this wise :</l>
       <l n="141">“ Onaway ! Awake , beloved !</l>
       <l n="142">Thou the wild-flower of the forest !</l>
       <l n="143">Thou the wild-bird of the prairie !</l>
       <l n="144">Thou with eyes so soft and fawn-like !</l>
       <l n="145">“ If thou only lookest at me ,</l>
       <l n="146">I am happy , I am happy ,</l>
       <l n="147">As the lilies of the prairie ,</l>
       <l n="148">When they feel the dew upon them !</l>
       <l n="149">“ Sweet thy breath is as the fragrance</l>
       <l n="150">Of the wild-flowers in the morning ,</l>
       <l n="151">As their fragrance is at evening ,</l>
       <l n="152">In the Moon when leaves are falling .</l>
       <l n="153">“ Does not all the blood within me</l>
       <l n="154">Leap to meet thee , leap to meet thee ,</l>
       <l n="155">As the springs to meet the sunshine ,</l>
       <l n="156">In the Moon when nights are brightest ?</l>
       <l n="157">“ Onaway ! my heart sings to thee ,</l>
       <l n="158">Sings with joy when thou art near me ,</l>
       <l n="159">As the sighing , singing branches</l>
       <l n="160">In the pleasant Moon of Strawberries !</l>
       <l n="161">“ When thou art not pleased , beloved ,</l>
       <l n="162">Then my heart is sad and darkened ,</l>
       <l n="163">As the shining river darkens</l>
       <l n="164">When the clouds drop shadows on it !</l>
       <l n="165">“ When thou smilest , my beloved ,</l>
       <l n="166">Then my troubled heart is brightened ,</l>
       <l n="167">As in sunshine gleam the ripples</l>
       <l n="168">That the cold wind makes in rivers .</l>
       <l n="169">“ Smiles the earth , and smile the waters ,</l>
       <l n="170">Smile the cloudless skies above us ,</l>
       <l n="171">But I lose the way of smiling</l>
       <l n="172">When thou art no longer near me !</l>
       <l n="173">“ I myself , myself ! behold me !</l>
       <l n="174">Blood of my beating heart , behold me !</l>
       <l n="175">Oh awake , awake , beloved !</l>
       <l n="176">Onaway ! awake , beloved ! ”</l>
       <l n="177">Thus the gentle Chibiabos</l>
       <l n="178">Sang his song of love and longing ;</l>
       <l n="179">And Iagoo , the great boaster ,</l>
       <l n="180">He the marvellous story-teller ,</l>
       <l n="181">He the friend of old Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="182">Jealous of the sweet musician ,</l>
       <l n="183">Jealous of the applause they gave him ,</l>
       <l n="184">Saw in all the eyes around him ,</l>
       <l n="185">Saw in all their looks and gestures ,</l>
       <l n="186">That the wedding guests assembled</l>
       <l n="187">Longed to hear his pleasant stories ,</l>
       <l n="188">His immeasurable falsehoods .</l>
       <l n="189">Very boastful was Iagoo ;</l>
       <l n="190">Never heard he an adventure</l>
       <l n="191">But himself had met a greater ;</l>
       <l n="192">Never any deed of daring</l>
       <l n="193">But himself had done a bolder ;</l>
       <l n="194">Never any marvellous story</l>
       <l n="195">But himself could tell a stranger .</l>
       <l n="196">Would you listen to his boasting ,</l>
       <l n="197">Would you only give him credence ,</l>
       <l n="198">No one ever shot an arrow</l>
       <l n="199">Half so far and high as he had ;</l>
       <l n="200">Ever caught so many fishes ,</l>
       <l n="201">Ever killed so many reindeer ,</l>
       <l n="202">Ever trapped so many beaver !</l>
       <l n="203">None could run so fast as he could ,</l>
       <l n="204">None could dive so deep as he could ,</l>
       <l n="205">None could swim so far as he could ;</l>
       <l n="206">None had made so many journeys ,</l>
       <l n="207">None had seen so many wonders ,</l>
       <l n="208">As this wonderful Iagoo ,</l>
       <l n="209">As this marvellous story-teller !</l>
       <l n="210">Thus his name became a by-word</l>
       <l n="211">And a jest among the people ;</l>
       <l n="212">And whene'er a boastful hunter</l>
       <l n="213">Praised his own address too highly ,</l>
       <l n="214">Or a warrior , home returning ,</l>
       <l n="215">Talked too much of his achievements ,</l>
       <l n="216">All his hearers cried , “ Iagoo !</l>
       <l n="217">Here 's Iagoo come among us ! ”</l>
       <l n="218">He it was who carved the cradle</l>
       <l n="219">Of the little Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="220">Carved its framework out of linden ,</l>
       <l n="221">Bound it strong with reindeer sinews ;</l>
       <l n="222">He it was who taught him later</l>
       <l n="223">How to make his bows and arrows ,</l>
       <l n="224">How to make the bows of ash-tree ,</l>
       <l n="225">And the arrows of the oak-tree .</l>
       <l n="226">So among the guests assembled</l>
       <l n="227">At my Hiawatha 's wedding</l>
       <l n="228">Sat Iagoo , old and ugly ,</l>
       <l n="229">Sat the marvellous story-teller .</l>
       <l n="230">And they said , “ O good Iagoo ,</l>
       <l n="231">Tell us now a tale of wonder ,</l>
       <l n="232">Tell us of some strange adventure ,</l>
       <l n="233">That the feast may be more joyous ,</l>
       <l n="234">That the time may pass more gayly ,</l>
       <l n="235">And our guests be more contented ! ”</l>
       <l n="236">And Iagoo answered straightway ,</l>
       <l n="237">“ You shall hear a tale of wonder ,</l>
       <l n="238">You shall hear the strange adventures</l>
       <l n="239">Of Osseo , the Magician ,</l>
       <l n="240">From the Evening Star descending . ”</l>

      <head>THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR</head>
       <l n="1">Can it be the sun descending</l>
       <l n="2">O'er the level plain of water ?</l>
       <l n="3">Or the Red Swan floating , flying ,</l>
       <l n="4">Wounded by the magic arrow ,</l>
       <l n="5">Staining all the waves with crimson ,</l>
       <l n="6">With the crimson of its life-blood ,</l>
       <l n="7">Filling all the air with splendor ,</l>
       <l n="8">With the splendor of its plumage ?</l>
       <l n="9">Yes ; it is the sun descending ,</l>
       <l n="10">Sinking down into the water ;</l>
       <l n="11">All the sky is stained with purple ,</l>
       <l n="12">All the water flushed with crimson !</l>
       <l n="13">No ; it is the Red Swan floating ,</l>
       <l n="14">Diving down beneath the water ;</l>
       <l n="15">To the sky its wings are lifted ,</l>
       <l n="16">With its blood the waves are reddened !</l>
       <l n="17">Over it the Star of Evening</l>
       <l n="18">Melts and trembles through the purple ,</l>
       <l n="19">Hangs suspended in the twilight .</l>
       <l n="20">No ; it is a bead of wampum</l>
       <l n="21">On the robes of the Great Spirit</l>
       <l n="22">As he passes through the twilight ,</l>
       <l n="23">Walks in silence through the heavens .</l>
       <l n="24">This with joy beheld Iagoo</l>
       <l n="25">And he said in haste : “ Behold it !</l>
       <l n="26">See the sacred Star of Evening !</l>
       <l n="27">You shall hear a tale of wonder ,</l>
       <l n="28">Hear the story of Osseo ,</l>
       <l n="29">Son of the Evening Star , Osseo !</l>
       <l n="30">“ Once , in days no more remembered ,</l>
       <l n="31">Ages nearer the beginning ,</l>
       <l n="32">When the heavens were closer to us ,</l>
       <l n="33">And the Gods were more familiar ,</l>
       <l n="34">In the North-land lived a hunter ,</l>
       <l n="35">With ten young and comely daughters ,</l>
       <l n="36">Tall and lithe as wands of willow ;</l>
       <l n="37">Only Oweenee , the youngest ,</l>
       <l n="38">She the wilful and the wayward ,</l>
       <l n="39">She the silent , dreamy maiden ,</l>
       <l n="40">Was the fairest of the sisters .</l>
       <l n="41">“ All these women married warriors ,</l>
       <l n="42">Married brave and haughty husbands ;</l>
       <l n="43">Only Oweenee , the youngest ,</l>
       <l n="44">Laughed and flouted all her lovers ,</l>
       <l n="45">All her young and handsome suitors ,</l>
       <l n="46">And then married old Osseo ,</l>
       <l n="47">Old Osseo , poor and ugly ,</l>
       <l n="48">Broken with age and weak with coughing ,</l>
       <l n="49">Always coughing like a squirrel .</l>
       <l n="50">“ Ah , but beautiful within him</l>
       <l n="51">Was the spirit of Osseo ,</l>
       <l n="52">From the Evening Star descended ,</l>
       <l n="53">Star of Evening , Star of Woman ,</l>
       <l n="54">Star of tenderness and passion !</l>
       <l n="55">All its fire was in his bosom ,</l>
       <l n="56">All its beauty in his spirit ,</l>
       <l n="57">All its mystery in his being ,</l>
       <l n="58">All its splendor in his language !</l>
       <l n="59">“ And her lovers , the rejected ,</l>
       <l n="60">Handsome men with belts of wampum ,</l>
       <l n="61">Handsome men with paint and feathers .</l>
       <l n="62">Pointed at her in derision ,</l>
       <l n="63">Followed her with jest and laughter .</l>
       <l n="64">But she said : ‘ I care not for you ,</l>
       <l n="65">Care not for your belts of wampum ,</l>
       <l n="66">Care not for your paint and feathers ,</l>
       <l n="67">Care not for your jests and laughter ;</l>
       <l n="68">I am happy with Osseo ! ’</l>
       <l n="69">“ Once to some great feast invited ,</l>
       <l n="70">Through the damp and dusk of evening ,</l>
       <l n="71">Walked together the ten sisters ,</l>
       <l n="72">Walked together with their husbands ;</l>
       <l n="73">Slowly followed old Osseo ,</l>
       <l n="74">With fair Oweenee beside him ;</l>
       <l n="75">All the others chatted gayly ,</l>
       <l n="76">These two only walked in silence .</l>
       <l n="77">“ At the western sky Osseo</l>
       <l n="78">Gazed intent , as if imploring ,</l>
       <l n="79">Often stopped and gazed imploring</l>
       <l n="80">At the trembling Star of Evening ,</l>
       <l n="81">At the tender Star of Woman ;</l>
       <l n="82">And they heard him murmur softly ,</l>
       <l n="83">‘ Ah , showain nemeshin , Nosa !</l>
       <l n="84">Pity , pity me , my father ! ’</l>
       <l n="85">“ ‘ Listen ! ’ said the eldest sister ,</l>
       <l n="86">‘ He is praying to his father !</l>
       <l n="87">What a pity that the old man</l>
       <l n="88">Does not stumble in the pathway ,</l>
       <l n="89">Does not break his neck by falling ! ’</l>
       <l n="90">And they laughed till all the forest</l>
       <l n="91">Rang with their unseemly laughter .</l>
       <l n="92">“ On their pathway through the woodlands</l>
       <l n="93">Lay an oak , by storms uprooted ,</l>
       <l n="94">Lay the great trunk of an oak-tree ,</l>
       <l n="95">Buried half in leaves and mosses ,</l>
       <l n="96">Mouldering , crumbling , huge and hollow .</l>
       <l n="97">And Osseo , when he saw it ,</l>
       <l n="98">Gave a shout , a cry of anguish ,</l>
       <l n="99">Leaped into its yawning cavern ,</l>
       <l n="100">At one end went in an old man ,</l>
       <l n="101">Wasted , wrinkled , old , and ugly ;</l>
       <l n="102">From the other came a young man ,</l>
       <l n="103">Tall and straight and strong and handsome .</l>
       <l n="104">“ Thus Osseo was transfigured ,</l>
       <l n="105">Thus restored to youth and beauty ;</l>
       <l n="106">But , alas for good Osseo ,</l>
       <l n="107">And for Oweenee , the faithful !</l>
       <l n="108">Strangely , too , was she transfigured .</l>
       <l n="109">Changed into a weak old woman ,</l>
       <l n="110">With a staff she tottered onward ,</l>
       <l n="111">Wasted , wrinkled , old , and ugly !</l>
       <l n="112">And the sisters and their husbands</l>
       <l n="113">Laughed until the echoing forest</l>
       <l n="114">Rang with their unseemly laughter .</l>
       <l n="115">“ But Osseo turned not from her ,</l>
       <l n="116">Walked with slower step beside her ,</l>
       <l n="117">Took her hand , as brown and withered</l>
       <l n="118">As an oak-leaf is in Winter ,</l>
       <l n="119">Called her sweetheart , Nenemoosha ,</l>
       <l n="120">Soothed her with soft words of kindness ,</l>
       <l n="121">Till they reached the lodge of feasting ,</l>
       <l n="122">Till they sat down in the wigwam ,</l>
       <l n="123">Sacred to the Star of Evening ,</l>
       <l n="124">To the tender Star of Woman .</l>
       <l n="125">“ Wrapt in visions , lost in dreaming ,</l>
       <l n="126">At the banquet sat Osseo ;</l>
       <l n="127">All were merry , all were happy ,</l>
       <l n="128">All were joyous but Osseo .</l>
       <l n="129">Neither food nor drink he tasted ,</l>
       <l n="130">Neither did he speak nor listen ;</l>
       <l n="131">But as one bewildered sat he ,</l>
       <l n="132">Looking dreamily and sadly ,</l>
       <l n="133">First at Oweenee , then upward</l>
       <l n="134">At the gleaming sky above them .</l>
       <l n="135">“ Then a voice was heard , a whisper ,</l>
       <l n="136">Coming from the starry distance ,</l>
       <l n="137">Coming from the empty vastness ,</l>
       <l n="138">Low , and musical , and tender ;</l>
       <l n="139">And the voice said : ‘ O Osseo !</l>
       <l n="140">O my son , my best beloved !</l>
       <l n="141">Broken are the spells that bound you ,</l>
       <l n="142">All the charms of the magicians ,</l>
       <l n="143">All the magic powers of evil ;</l>
       <l n="144">Come to me ; ascend , Osseo !</l>
       <l n="145">“ ‘ Taste the food that stands before you :</l>
       <l n="146">It is blessed and enchanted ,</l>
       <l n="147">It has magic virtues in it ,</l>
       <l n="148">It will change you to a spirit .</l>
       <l n="149">All your bowls and all your kettles</l>
       <l n="150">Shall be wood and clay no longer ;</l>
       <l n="151">But the bowls be changed to wampum ,</l>
       <l n="152">And the kettles shall be silver ;</l>
       <l n="153">They shall shine like shells of scarlet ,</l>
       <l n="154">Like the fire shall gleam and glimmer .</l>
       <l n="155">“ ‘ And the women shall no longer</l>
       <l n="156">Bear the dreary doom of labor ,</l>
       <l n="157">But be changed to birds , and glisten</l>
       <l n="158">With the beauty of the starlight ,</l>
       <l n="159">Painted with the dusky splendors</l>
       <l n="160">Of the skies and clouds of evening ! ’</l>
       <l n="161">“ What Osseo heard as whispers ,</l>
       <l n="162">What as words he comprehended ,</l>
       <l n="163">Was but music to the others ,</l>
       <l n="164">Music as of birds afar off ,</l>
       <l n="165">Of the whippoorwill afar off ,</l>
       <l n="166">Of the lonely Wawonaissa</l>
       <l n="167">Singing in the darksome forest .</l>
       <l n="168">“ Then the lodge began to tremble ,</l>
       <l n="169">Straight began to shake and tremble ,</l>
       <l n="170">And they felt it rising , rising ,</l>
       <l n="171">Slowly through the air ascending ,</l>
       <l n="172">From the darkness of the tree-tops</l>
       <l n="173">Forth into the dewy starlight ,</l>
       <l n="174">Till it passed the topmost branches ;</l>
       <l n="175">And behold ! the wooden dishes</l>
       <l n="176">All were changed to shells of scarlet !</l>
       <l n="177">And behold ! the earthen kettles</l>
       <l n="178">All were changed to bowls of silver !</l>
       <l n="179">And the roof-poles of the wigwam</l>
       <l n="180">Were as glittering rods of silver ,</l>
       <l n="181">And the roof of bark upon them</l>
       <l n="182">As the shining shards of beetles .</l>
       <l n="183">“ Then Osseo gazed around him ,</l>
       <l n="184">And he saw the nine fair sisters ,</l>
       <l n="185">All the sisters and their husbands ,</l>
       <l n="186">Changed to birds of various plumage .</l>
       <l n="187">Some were jays and some were magpies ,</l>
       <l n="188">Others thrushes , others blackbirds ;</l>
       <l n="189">And they hopped , and sang , and twittered ,</l>
       <l n="190">Perked and fluttered all their feathers ,</l>
       <l n="191">Strutted in their shining plumage ,</l>
       <l n="192">And their tails like fans unfolded .</l>
       <l n="193">“ Only Oweenee , the youngest ,</l>
       <l n="194">Was not changed , but sat in silence ,</l>
       <l n="195">Wasted , wrinkled , old , and ugly ,</l>
       <l n="196">Looking sadly at the others ;</l>
       <l n="197">Till Osseo , gazing upward ,</l>
       <l n="198">Gave another cry of anguish ,</l>
       <l n="199">Such a cry as he had uttered</l>
       <l n="200">By the oak-tree in the forest .</l>
       <l n="201">“ Then returned her youth and beauty ,</l>
       <l n="202">And her soiled and tattered garments</l>
       <l n="203">Were transformed to robes of ermine ,</l>
       <l n="204">And her staff became a feather ,</l>
       <l n="205">Yes , a shining silver feather !</l>
       <l n="206">“ And again the wigwam trembled ,</l>
       <l n="207">Swayed and rushed through airy currents ,</l>
       <l n="208">Through transparent cloud and vapor ,</l>
       <l n="209">And amid celestial splendors</l>
       <l n="210">On the Evening Star alighted ,</l>
       <l n="211">As a snow-flake falls on snow-flake ,</l>
       <l n="212">As a leaf drops on a river ,</l>
       <l n="213">As the thistledown on water .</l>
       <l n="214">“ Forth with cheerful words of welcome</l>
       <l n="215">Came the father of Osseo ,</l>
       <l n="216">He with radiant locks of silver ,</l>
       <l n="217">He with eyes serene and tender .</l>
       <l n="218">And he said : ‘ My son , Osseo ,</l>
       <l n="219">Hang the cage of birds you bring there ,</l>
       <l n="220">Hang the cage with rods of silver ,</l>
       <l n="221">And the birds with glistening feathers ,</l>
       <l n="222">At the doorway of my wigwam . ’</l>
       <l n="223">“ At the door he hung the bird-cage ,</l>
       <l n="224">And they entered in and gladly</l>
       <l n="225">Listened to Osseo 's father ,</l>
       <l n="226">Ruler of the Star of Evening ,</l>
       <l n="227">As he said : ‘ O my Osseo !</l>
       <l n="228">I have had compassion on you ,</l>
       <l n="229">Given you back your youth and beauty ,</l>
       <l n="230">Into birds of various plumage</l>
       <l n="231">Changed your sisters and their husbands ;</l>
       <l n="232">Changed them thus because they mocked you</l>
       <l n="233">In the figure of the old man ,</l>
       <l n="234">In that aspect sad and wrinkled ,</l>
       <l n="235">Could not see your heart of passion ,</l>
       <l n="236">Could not see your youth immortal ;</l>
       <l n="237">Only Oweenee , the faithful ,</l>
       <l n="238">Saw your naked heart and loved you .</l>
       <l n="239">“ ‘ In the lodge that glimmers yonder ,</l>
       <l n="240">In the little star that twinkles</l>
       <l n="241">Through the vapors , on the left hand ,</l>
       <l n="242">Lives the envious Evil Spirit ,</l>
       <l n="243">The Wabeno , the magician ,</l>
       <l n="244">Who transformed you to an old man .</l>
       <l n="245">Take heed lest his beams fall on you ,</l>
       <l n="246">For the rays he darts around him</l>
       <l n="247">Are the power of his enchantment ,</l>
       <l n="248">Are the arrows that he uses . ’</l>
       <l n="249">“ Many years , in peace and quiet ,</l>
       <l n="250">On the peaceful Star of Evening</l>
       <l n="251">Dwelt Osseo with his father ;</l>
       <l n="252">Many years , in song and flutter ,</l>
       <l n="253">At the doorway of the wigwam ,</l>
       <l n="254">Hung the cage with rods of silver ,</l>
       <l n="255">And fair Oweenee , the faithful ,</l>
       <l n="256">Bore a son unto Osseo ,</l>
       <l n="257">With the beauty of his mother ,</l>
       <l n="258">With the courage of his father .</l>
       <l n="259">“ And the boy grew up and prospered ,</l>
       <l n="260">And Osseo , to delight him ,</l>
       <l n="261">Made him little bows and arrows ,</l>
       <l n="262">Opened the great cage of silver ,</l>
       <l n="263">And let loose his aunts and uncles ,</l>
       <l n="264">All those birds with glossy feathers ,</l>
       <l n="265">For his little son to shoot at .</l>
       <l n="266">“ Round and round they wheeled and darted ,</l>
       <l n="267">Filled the Evening Star with music ,</l>
       <l n="268">With their songs of joy and freedom</l>
       <l n="269">Filled the Evening Star with splendor ,</l>
       <l n="270">With the fluttering of their plumage ;</l>
       <l n="271">Till the boy , the little hunter ,</l>
       <l n="272">Bent his bow and shot an arrow ,</l>
       <l n="273">Shot a swift and fatal arrow ,</l>
       <l n="274">And a bird , with shining feathers ,</l>
       <l n="275">At his feet fell wounded sorely .</l>
       <l n="276">“ But , O wondrous transformation !</l>
       <l n="277">‘ T was no bird he saw before him ,</l>
       <l n="278">‘ T was a beautiful young woman ,</l>
       <l n="279">With the arrow in her bosom !</l>
       <l n="280">“ When her blood fell on the planet ,</l>
       <l n="281">On the sacred Star of Evening ,</l>
       <l n="282">Broken was the spell of magic ,</l>
       <l n="283">Powerless was the strange enchantment ,</l>
       <l n="284">And the youth , the fearless bowman ,</l>
       <l n="285">Suddenly felt himself descending ,</l>
       <l n="286">Held by unseen hands , but sinking</l>
       <l n="287">Downward through the empty spaces ,</l>
       <l n="288">Downward through the clouds and vapors ,</l>
       <l n="289">Till he rested on an island ,</l>
       <l n="290">On an island , green and grassy ,</l>
       <l n="291">Yonder in the Big-Sea-Water .</l>
       <l n="292">“ After him he saw descending</l>
       <l n="293">All the birds with shining feathers ,</l>
       <l n="294">Fluttering , falling , wafted downward ,</l>
       <l n="295">Like the painted leaves of Autumn ;</l>
       <l n="296">And the lodge with poles of silver ,</l>
       <l n="297">With its roof like wings of beetles ,</l>
       <l n="298">Like the shining shards of beetles ,</l>
       <l n="299">By the winds of heaven uplifted ,</l>
       <l n="300">Slowly sank upon the island ,</l>
       <l n="301">Bringing back the good Osseo ,</l>
       <l n="302">Bringing Oweenee , the faithful .</l>
       <l n="303">“ Then the birds , again transfigured ,</l>
       <l n="304">Reassumed the shape of mortals ,</l>
       <l n="305">Took their shape , but not their stature ;</l>
       <l n="306">They remained as Little People ,</l>
       <l n="307">Like the pygmies , the Puk-Wudjies ,</l>
       <l n="308">And on pleasant nights of Summer ,</l>
       <l n="309">When the Evening Star was shining ,</l>
       <l n="310">Hand in hand they danced together</l>
       <l n="311">On the island 's craggy headlands ,</l>
       <l n="312">On the sand-beach low and level .</l>
       <l n="313">“ Still their glittering lodge is seen there ,</l>
       <l n="314">On the tranquil Summer evenings ,</l>
       <l n="315">And upon the shore the fisher</l>
       <l n="316">Sometimes hears their happy voices ,</l>
       <l n="317">Sees them dancing in the starlight ! ”</l>
       <l n="318">When the story was completed ,</l>
       <l n="319">When the wondrous tale was ended ,</l>
       <l n="320">Looking round upon his listeners ,</l>
       <l n="321">Solemnly Iagoo added :</l>
       <l n="322">“ There are great men , I have known such ,</l>
       <l n="323">Whom their people understand not ,</l>
       <l n="324">Whom they even make a jest of ,</l>
       <l n="325">Scoff and jeer at in derision .</l>
       <l n="326">From the story of Osseo</l>
       <l n="327">Let us learn the fate of jesters ! ”</l>
       <l n="328">All the wedding guests delighted</l>
       <l n="329">Listened to the marvellous story ,</l>
       <l n="330">Listened laughing and applauding ,</l>
       <l n="331">And they whispered to each other :</l>
       <l n="332">“ Does he mean himself , I wonder ?</l>
       <l n="333">And are we the aunts and uncles ? ”</l>
       <l n="334">Then again sang Chibiabos ,</l>
       <l n="335">Sang a song of love and longing ,</l>
       <l n="336">In those accents sweet and tender ,</l>
       <l n="337">In those tones of pensive sadness ,</l>
       <l n="338">Sang a maiden 's lamentation</l>
       <l n="339">For her lover , her Algonquin .</l>
       <l n="340">“ When I think of my beloved ,</l>
       <l n="341">Ah me ! think of my beloved ,</l>
       <l n="342">When my heart is thinking of him ,</l>
       <l n="343">O my sweetheart , my Algonquin !</l>
       <l n="344">“ Ah me ! when I parted from him ,</l>
       <l n="345">Round my neck he hung the wampum ,</l>
       <l n="346">As a pledge , the snow-white wampum ,</l>
       <l n="347">O my sweetheart , my Algonquin !</l>
       <l n="348">“ I will go with you , he whispered ,</l>
       <l n="349">Ah me ! to your native country ;</l>
       <l n="350">Let me go with you , he whispered ,</l>
       <l n="351">O my sweetheart , my Algonquin !</l>
       <l n="352">“ Far away , away , I answered ,</l>
       <l n="353">Very far away , I answered ,</l>
       <l n="354">Ah me ! is my native country ,</l>
       <l n="355">O my sweetheart , my Algonquin !</l>
       <l n="356">“ When I looked back to behold him ,</l>
       <l n="357">Where we parted , to behold him ,</l>
       <l n="358">After me he still was gazing ,</l>
       <l n="359">O my sweetheart , my Algonquin !</l>
       <l n="360">“ By the tree he still was standing ,</l>
       <l n="361">By the fallen tree was standing ,</l>
       <l n="362">That had dropped into the water ,</l>
       <l n="363">O my sweetheart , my Algonquin !</l>
       <l n="364">“ When I think of my beloved ,</l>
       <l n="365">Ah me ! think of my beloved ,</l>
       <l n="366">When my heart is thinking of him ,</l>
       <l n="367">O my sweetheart , my Algonquin ! ”</l>
       <l n="368">Such was Hiawatha 's Wedding ,</l>
       <l n="369">Such the dance of Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="370">Such the story of Iagoo ,</l>
       <l n="371">Such the songs of Chibiabos ;</l>
       <l n="372">Thus the wedding banquet ended ,</l>
       <l n="373">And the wedding guests departed ,</l>
       <l n="374">Leaving Hiawatha happy</l>

      <head>BLESSING THE CORNFIELDS</head>
       <l n="1">Sing , O Song of Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="2">Of the happy days that followed ,</l>
       <l n="3">In the land of the Ojibways ,</l>

       <l n="5">Sing the mysteries of Mondamin ,</l>
       <l n="6">Sing the Blessing of the Cornfields !</l>
       <l n="7">Buried was the bloody hatchet ,</l>
       <l n="8">Buried was the dreadful war-club ,</l>
       <l n="9">Buried were all warlike weapons ,</l>
       <l n="10">And the war-cry was forgotten .</l>
       <l n="11">There was peace among the nations ;</l>
       <l n="12">Unmolested roved the hunters ,</l>
       <l n="13">Built the birch canoe for sailing ,</l>
       <l n="14">Caught the fish in lake and river ,</l>
       <l n="15">Shot the deer and trapped the beaver ;</l>
       <l n="16">Unmolested worked the women ,</l>
       <l n="17">Made their sugar from the maple ,</l>
       <l n="18">Gathered wild rice in the meadows ,</l>
       <l n="19">Dressed the skins of deer and beaver .</l>
       <l n="20">All around the happy village</l>
       <l n="21">Stood the maize-fields , green and shining ,</l>
       <l n="22">Waved the green plumes of Mondamin ,</l>
       <l n="23">Waved his soft and sunny tresses ,</l>
       <l n="24">Filling all the land with plenty .</l>
       <l n="25">‘ T was the women who in Spring-time</l>
       <l n="26">Planted the broad fields and fruitful ,</l>
       <l n="27">Buried in the earth Mondamin ;</l>

       <l n="30">Stripped the garments from Mondamin ,</l>
       <l n="31">Even as Hiawatha taught them .</l>
       <l n="32">Once , when all the maize was planted ,</l>
       <l n="33">Hiawatha , wise and thoughtful ,</l>
       <l n="34">Spake and said to Minnehaha ,</l>

       <l n="44">When the Spirit of Sleep , Nepahwin ,</l>
       <l n="45">Shuts the doors of all the wigwams ,</l>
       <l n="46">So that not an ear can hear you ,</l>
       <l n="47">So that not an eye can see you ,</l>
       <l n="48">Rise up from your bed in silence ,</l>
       <l n="49">Lay aside your garments wholly ,</l>
       <l n="50">Walk around the fields you planted ,</l>
       <l n="51">Round the borders of the cornfields ,</l>
       <l n="52">Covered by your tresses only ,</l>
       <l n="53">Robed with darkness as a garment .</l>

       <l n="66">On the tree-tops near the cornfields</l>
       <l n="67">Sat the hungry crows and ravens ,</l>
       <l n="68">Kahgahgee , the King of Ravens ,</l>
       <l n="69">With his band of black marauders .</l>
       <l n="70">And they laughed at Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="71">Till the tree-tops shook with laughter ,</l>
       <l n="72">With their melancholy laughter ,</l>
       <l n="73">At the words of Hiawatha .</l>
       <l n="74">“ Hear him ! ” said they ; “ hear the Wise Man ,</l>
       <l n="75">Hear the plots of Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="76">When the noiseless night descended</l>
       <l n="77">Broad and dark o'er field and forest ,</l>
       <l n="78">When the mournful Wawonaissa</l>
       <l n="79">Sorrowing sang among the hemlocks ,</l>
       <l n="80">And the Spirit of Sleep , Nepahwin ,</l>
       <l n="81">Shut the doors of all the wigwams ,</l>
       <l n="82">From her bed rose Laughing Water ,</l>
       <l n="83">Laid aside her garments wholly ,</l>
       <l n="84">And with darkness clothed and guarded ,</l>
       <l n="85">Unashamed and unaffrighted ,</l>
       <l n="86">Walked securely round the cornfields ,</l>
       <l n="87">Drew the sacred , magic circle</l>
       <l n="88">Of her footprints round the cornfields .</l>
       <l n="89">No one but the Midnight only</l>
       <l n="90">Saw her beauty in the darkness ,</l>
       <l n="91">No one but the Wawonaissa</l>
       <l n="92">Heard the panting of her bosom ;</l>
       <l n="93">Guskewau , the darkness , wrapped her</l>
       <l n="94">Closely in his sacred mantle ,</l>
       <l n="95">So that none might see her beauty ,</l>
       <l n="96">So that none might boast , “ I saw her ! ”</l>
       <l n="97">On the morrow , as the day dawned ,</l>
       <l n="98">Kahgahgee , the King of Ravens ,</l>
       <l n="99">Gathered all his black marauders ,</l>
       <l n="100">Crows and blackbirds , jays and ravens ,</l>
       <l n="101">Clamorous on the dusky tree-tops ,</l>
       <l n="102">And descended , fast and fearless ,</l>
       <l n="103">On the fields of Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="104">On the grave of the Mondamin .</l>
       <l n="105">“ We will drag Mondamin , ” said they ,</l>
       <l n="106">“ From the grave where he is buried ,</l>
       <l n="107">Spite of all the magic circles</l>
       <l n="108">Laughing Water draws around it ,</l>

       <l n="110">Minnehaha stamps upon it ! ”</l>
       <l n="111">But the wary Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="112">Ever thoughtful , careful , watchful ,</l>
       <l n="113">Had o'erheard the scornful laughter</l>
       <l n="114">When they mocked him from the tree-tops .</l>
       <l n="115">“ Kaw ! ” he said , “ my friends the ravens !</l>
       <l n="116">Kahgahgee , my King of Ravens !</l>
       <l n="117">I will teach you all a lesson</l>
       <l n="118">That shall not be soon forgotten ! ”</l>
       <l n="119">He had risen before the daybreak ,</l>
       <l n="120">He had spread o'er all the cornfields</l>
       <l n="121">Snares to catch the black marauders ,</l>
       <l n="122">And was lying now in ambush</l>
       <l n="123">In the neighboring grove of pine-trees ,</l>
       <l n="124">Waiting for the crows and blackbirds ,</l>
       <l n="125">Waiting for the jays and ravens .</l>
       <l n="126">Soon they came with caw and clamor ,</l>
       <l n="127">Rush of wings and cry of voices ,</l>
       <l n="128">To their work of devastation ,</l>
       <l n="129">Settling down upon the cornfields ,</l>
       <l n="130">Delving deep with beak and talon ,</l>
       <l n="131">For the body of Mondamin .</l>
       <l n="132">And with all their craft and cunning ,</l>
       <l n="133">All their skill in wiles of warfare ,</l>
       <l n="134">They perceived no danger near them ,</l>
       <l n="135">Till their claws became entangled ,</l>
       <l n="136">Till they found themselves imprisoned</l>
       <l n="137">In the snares of Hiawatha .</l>
       <l n="138">From his place of ambush came he ,</l>
       <l n="139">Striding terrible among them ,</l>
       <l n="140">And so awful was his aspect</l>
       <l n="141">That the bravest quailed with terror .</l>
       <l n="142">Without mercy he destroyed them</l>
       <l n="143">Right and left , by tens and twenties ,</l>
       <l n="144">And their wretched , lifeless bodies</l>
       <l n="145">Hung aloft on poles for scarecrows</l>
       <l n="146">Round the consecrated cornfields ,</l>
       <l n="147">As a signal of his vengeance ,</l>
       <l n="148">As a warning to marauders .</l>
       <l n="149">Only Kahgahgee , the leader ,</l>
       <l n="150">Kahgahgee , the King of Ravens ,</l>
       <l n="151">He alone was spared among them</l>
       <l n="152">As a hostage for his people .</l>
       <l n="153">With his prisoner-string he bound him ,</l>
       <l n="154">Led him captive to his wigwam ,</l>
       <l n="155">Tied him fast with cords of elm-bark</l>
       <l n="156">To the ridge-pole of his wigwam .</l>
       <l n="157">“ Kahgahgee , my raven ! ” said he ,</l>
       <l n="158">“ You the leader of the robbers ,</l>
       <l n="159">You the plotter of this mischief ,</l>

       <l n="163">As a pledge of good behavior ! ”</l>
       <l n="164">And he left him , grim and sulky ,</l>
       <l n="165">Sitting in the morning sunshine</l>
       <l n="166">On the summit of the wigwam ,</l>
       <l n="167">Croaking fiercely his displeasure ,</l>
       <l n="168">Flapping his great sable pinions ,</l>
       <l n="169">Vainly struggling for his freedom ,</l>
       <l n="170">Vainly calling on his people !</l>
       <l n="171">Summer passed , and Shawondasee</l>
       <l n="172">Breathed his sighs o'er all the landscape ,</l>
       <l n="173">From the South-land sent his ardor ,</l>
       <l n="174">Wafted kisses warm and tender ;</l>
       <l n="175">And the maize-field grew and ripened ,</l>
       <l n="176">Till it stood in all the splendor</l>
       <l n="177">Of its garments green and yellow ,</l>
       <l n="178">Of its tassels and its plumage ,</l>
       <l n="179">And the maize-ears full and shining</l>
       <l n="180">Gleamed from bursting sheaths of verdure .</l>
       <l n="181">Then Nokomis , the old woman ,</l>
       <l n="182">Spake , and said to Minnehaha :</l>
       <l n="183">“ ‘ T is the Moon when leaves are falling ;</l>

       <l n="186">Let us gather in the harvest ,</l>
       <l n="187">Let us wrestle with Mondamin ,</l>
       <l n="188">Strip him of his plumes and tassels ,</l>
       <l n="189">Of his garments green and yellow ! ”</l>
       <l n="190">And the merry Laughing Water</l>
       <l n="191">Went rejoicing from the wigwam ,</l>
       <l n="192">With Nokomis , old and wrinkled ,</l>
       <l n="193">And they called the women round them ,</l>
       <l n="194">Called the young men and the maidens ,</l>
       <l n="195">To the harvest of the cornfields ,</l>
       <l n="196">To the husking of the maize-ear .</l>
       <l n="197">On the border of the forest ,</l>
       <l n="198">Underneath the fragrant pine-trees ,</l>
       <l n="199">Sat the old men and the warriors</l>
       <l n="200">Smoking in the pleasant shadow .</l>
       <l n="201">In uninterrupted silence</l>
       <l n="202">Looked they at the gamesome labor</l>
       <l n="203">Of the young men and the women ;</l>
       <l n="204">Listened to their noisy talking ,</l>
       <l n="205">To their laughter and their singing ,</l>
       <l n="206">Heard them chattering like the magpies ,</l>
       <l n="207">Heard them laughing like the blue-jays ,</l>
       <l n="208">Heard them singing like the robins .</l>
       <l n="209">And whene'er some lucky maiden</l>
       <l n="210">Found a red ear in the husking ,</l>
       <l n="211">Found a maize-ear red as blood is ,</l>
       <l n="212">“ Nushka ! ” cried they all together ,</l>
       <l n="213">“ Nushka ! you shall have a sweetheart ,</l>
       <l n="214">You shall have a handsome husband ! ”</l>
       <l n="215">“ Ugh ! ” the old men all responded</l>
       <l n="216">From their seats beneath the pine-trees .</l>
       <l n="217">And whene'er a youth or maiden</l>
       <l n="218">Found a crooked ear in husking ,</l>
       <l n="219">Found a maize-ear in the husking</l>
       <l n="220">Blighted , mildewed , or misshapen ,</l>
       <l n="221">Then they laughed and sang together ,</l>
       <l n="222">Crept and limped about the cornfields ,</l>
       <l n="223">Mimicked in their gait and gestures</l>
       <l n="224">Some old man , bent almost double ,</l>
       <l n="225">Singing singly or together :</l>
       <l n="226">“ Wagemin , the thief of cornfields !</l>
       <l n="227">Paimosaid , who steals the maize-ear ! ”</l>
       <l n="228">Till the cornfields rang with laughter ,</l>
       <l n="229">Till from Hiawatha 's wigwam</l>
       <l n="230">Kahgahgee , the King of Ravens ,</l>
       <l n="231">Screamed and quivered in his anger ,</l>
       <l n="232">And from all the neighboring tree-tops</l>
       <l n="233">Cawed and croaked the black marauders .</l>
       <l n="234">“ Ugh ! ” the old men all responded ,</l>

       <l n="1">In those days said Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="2">“ Lo ! how all things fade and perish !</l>
       <l n="3">From the memory of the old men</l>
       <l n="4">Pass away the great traditions ,</l>
       <l n="5">The achievements of the warriors ,</l>
       <l n="6">The adventures of the hunters ,</l>
       <l n="7">All the wisdom of the Medas ,</l>
       <l n="8">All the craft of the Wabenos ,</l>
       <l n="9">All the marvellous dreams and visions</l>
       <l n="10">Of the Jossakeeds , the Prophets !</l>
       <l n="11">“ Great men die and are forgotten ,</l>
       <l n="12">Wise men speak ; their words of wisdom</l>
       <l n="13">Perish in the ears that hear them ,</l>
       <l n="14">Do not reach the generations</l>
       <l n="15">That , as yet unborn , are waiting</l>
       <l n="16">In the great , mysterious darkness</l>
       <l n="17">Of the speechless days that shall be !</l>
       <l n="18">“ On the grave-posts of our fathers</l>
       <l n="19">Are no signs , no figures painted ;</l>
       <l n="20">Who are in those graves we know not ,</l>
       <l n="21">Only know they are our fathers .</l>
       <l n="22">Of what kith they are and kindred ,</l>
       <l n="23">From what old , ancestral Totem ,</l>
       <l n="24">Be it Eagle , Bear , or Beaver ,</l>
       <l n="25">They descended , this we know not ,</l>
       <l n="26">Only know they are our fathers .</l>
       <l n="27">“ Face to face we speak together ,</l>
       <l n="28">But we cannot speak when absent ,</l>
       <l n="29">Cannot send our voices from us</l>

       <l n="31">Cannot send a secret message ,</l>

       <l n="34">May reveal it unto others . ”</l>
       <l n="35">Thus said Hiawatha , walking</l>
       <l n="36">In the solitary forest ,</l>
       <l n="37">Pondering , musing in the forest ,</l>
       <l n="38">On the welfare of his people .</l>
       <l n="39">From his pouch he took his colors ,</l>
       <l n="40">Took his paints of different colors ,</l>
       <l n="41">On the smooth bark of a birch-tree</l>
       <l n="42">Painted many shapes and figures ,</l>
       <l n="43">Wonderful and mystic figures ,</l>
       <l n="44">And each figure had a meaning ,</l>
       <l n="45">Each some word or thought suggested .</l>
       <l n="46">Gitche Manito the Mighty ,</l>
       <l n="47">He , the Master of Life , was painted</l>
       <l n="48">As an egg , with points projecting</l>
       <l n="49">To the four winds of the heavens .</l>
       <l n="50">Everywhere is the Great Spirit ,</l>
       <l n="51">Was the meaning of this symbol .</l>
       <l n="52">Mitche Manito the Mighty ,</l>
       <l n="53">He the dreadful Spirit of Evil ,</l>
       <l n="54">As a serpent was depicted ,</l>
       <l n="55">As Kenabeek , the great serpent .</l>
       <l n="56">Very crafty , very cunning ,</l>
       <l n="57">Is the creeping Spirit of Evil ,</l>
       <l n="58">Was the meaning of this symbol .</l>
       <l n="59">Life and Death he drew as circles ,</l>
       <l n="60">Life was white , but Death was darkened ;</l>
       <l n="61">Sun and moon and stars he painted ,</l>
       <l n="62">Man and beast , and fish and reptile ,</l>
       <l n="63">Forests , mountains , lakes , and rivers .</l>
       <l n="64">For the earth he drew a straight line ,</l>
       <l n="65">For the sky a bow above it ;</l>
       <l n="66">White the space between for daytime ,</l>
       <l n="67">Filled with little stars for night-time ;</l>
       <l n="68">On the left a point for sunrise ,</l>
       <l n="69">On the right a point for sunset ,</l>
       <l n="70">On the top a point for noontide ,</l>
       <l n="71">And for rain and cloudy weather</l>
       <l n="72">Waving lines descending from it .</l>
       <l n="73">Footprints pointing towards a wigwam</l>
       <l n="74">Were a sign of invitation ,</l>
       <l n="75">Were a sign of guests assembling ;</l>
       <l n="76">Bloody hands with palms uplifted</l>
       <l n="77">Were a symbol of destruction ,</l>
       <l n="78">Were a hostile sign and symbol .</l>
       <l n="79">All these things did Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="80">Show unto his wondering people ,</l>
       <l n="81">And interpreted their meaning ,</l>
       <l n="82">And he said : “ Behold , your grave-posts</l>
       <l n="83">Have no mark , no sign , nor symbol ,</l>
       <l n="84">Go and paint them all with figures ;</l>
       <l n="85">Each one with its household symbol ,</l>
       <l n="86">With its own ancestral Totem ;</l>
       <l n="87">So that those who follow after</l>
       <l n="88">May distinguish them and know them . ”</l>
       <l n="89">And they painted on the grave-posts</l>
       <l n="90">On the graves yet unforgotten ,</l>
       <l n="91">Each his own ancestral Totem ,</l>
       <l n="92">Each the symbol of his household ;</l>
       <l n="93">Figures of the Bear and Reindeer ,</l>
       <l n="94">Of the Turtle , Crane , and Beaver ,</l>
       <l n="95">Each inverted as a token</l>
       <l n="96">That the owner was departed ,</l>
       <l n="97">That the chief who bore the symbol</l>
       <l n="98">Lay beneath in dust and ashes .</l>
       <l n="99">And the Jossakeeds , the Prophets ,</l>
       <l n="100">The Wabenos , the Magicians ,</l>
       <l n="101">And the Medicine-men , the Medas ,</l>
       <l n="102">Painted upon bark and deer-skin</l>
       <l n="103">Figures for the songs they chanted ,</l>
       <l n="104">For each song a separate symbol ,</l>
       <l n="105">Figures mystical and awful ,</l>
       <l n="106">Figures strange and brightly colored ;</l>
       <l n="107">And each figure had its meaning ,</l>
       <l n="108">Each some magic song suggested .</l>
       <l n="109">The Great Spirit , the Creator ,</l>
       <l n="110">Flashing light through all the heaven ;</l>
       <l n="111">The Great Serpent , the Kenabeek ,</l>
       <l n="112">With his bloody crest erected ,</l>
       <l n="113">Creeping , looking into heaven ;</l>
       <l n="114">In the sky the sun , that listens ,</l>
       <l n="115">And the moon eclipsed and dying ;</l>
       <l n="116">Owl and eagle , crane and hen-hawk ,</l>
       <l n="117">And the cormorant , bird of magic ;</l>
       <l n="118">Headless men , that walk the heavens ,</l>
       <l n="119">Bodies lying pierced with arrows ,</l>
       <l n="120">Bloody hands of death uplifted ,</l>
       <l n="121">Flags on graves , and great war-captains</l>
       <l n="122">Grasping both the earth and heaven !</l>
       <l n="123">Such as these the shapes they painted</l>
       <l n="124">On the birch-bark and the deer-skin ;</l>
       <l n="125">Songs of war and songs of hunting ,</l>
       <l n="126">Songs of medicine and of magic ,</l>
       <l n="127">All were written in these figures ,</l>
       <l n="128">For each figure had its meaning ,</l>
       <l n="129">Each its separate song recorded .</l>
       <l n="130">Nor forgotten was the Love-Song ,</l>
       <l n="131">The most subtle of all medicines ,</l>
       <l n="132">The most potent spell of magic ,</l>
       <l n="133">Dangerous more than war or hunting !</l>
       <l n="134">Thus the Love-Song was recorded ,</l>
       <l n="135">Symbol and interpretation .</l>
       <l n="136">First a human figure standing ,</l>
       <l n="137">Painted in the brightest scarlet ;</l>
       <l n="138">‘ T is the lover , the musician ,</l>
       <l n="139">And the meaning is , “ My painting</l>
       <l n="140">Makes me powerful over others . ”</l>
       <l n="141">Then the figure seated , singing ,</l>
       <l n="142">Playing on a drum of magic ,</l>
       <l n="143">And the interpretation , “ Listen !</l>
       <l n="144">‘ T is my voice you hear , my singing ! ”</l>
       <l n="145">Then the same red figure seated</l>
       <l n="146">In the shelter of a wigwam ,</l>
       <l n="147">And the meaning of the symbol ,</l>
       <l n="148">“ I will come and sit beside you</l>
       <l n="149">In the mystery of my passion ! ”</l>
       <l n="150">Then two figures , man and woman ,</l>
       <l n="151">Standing hand in hand together</l>
       <l n="152">With their hands so clasped together</l>
       <l n="153">That they seemed in one united ,</l>
       <l n="154">And the words thus represented</l>
       <l n="155">Are , “ I see your heart within you ,</l>
       <l n="156">And your cheeks are red with blushes ! ”</l>
       <l n="157">Next the maiden on an island ,</l>
       <l n="158">In the centre of an island ;</l>
       <l n="159">And the song this shape suggested</l>
       <l n="160">Was , “ Though you were at a distance ,</l>
       <l n="161">Were upon some far-off island ,</l>
       <l n="162">Such the spell I cast upon you ,</l>
       <l n="163">Such the magic power of passion ,</l>
       <l n="164">I could straightway draw you to me ! ”</l>
       <l n="165">Then the figure of the maiden</l>
       <l n="166">Sleeping , and the lover near her ,</l>
       <l n="167">Whispering to her in her slumbers ,</l>
       <l n="168">Saying , “ Though you were far from me</l>
       <l n="169">In the land of Sleep and Silence ,</l>
       <l n="170">Still the voice of love would reach you ! ”</l>
       <l n="171">And the last of all the figures</l>
       <l n="172">Was a heart within a circle ,</l>
       <l n="173">Drawn within a magic circle ;</l>
       <l n="174">And the image had this meaning :</l>
       <l n="175">“ Naked lies your heart before me ,</l>
       <l n="176">To your naked heart I whisper ! ”</l>
       <l n="177">Thus it was that Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="178">In his wisdom , taught the people</l>
       <l n="179">All the mysteries of painting ,</l>
       <l n="180">All the art of Picture-Writing ,</l>
       <l n="181">On the smooth bark of the birch-tree ,</l>
       <l n="182">On the white skin of the reindeer ,</l>
       <l n="183">On the grave-posts of the village .</l>

      <head>HIAWATHA 'S LAMENTATION</head>
       <l n="1">In those days the Evil Spirits ,</l>
       <l n="2">All the Manitos of mischief ,</l>
       <l n="3">Fearing Hiawatha 's wisdom ,</l>
       <l n="4">And his love for Chibiabos ,</l>
       <l n="5">Jealous of their faithful friendship ,</l>
       <l n="6">And their noble words and actions ,</l>
       <l n="7">Made at length a league against them ,</l>
       <l n="8">To molest them and destroy them .</l>
       <l n="9">Hiawatha , wise and wary ,</l>
       <l n="10">Often said to Chibiabos ,</l>
       <l n="11">“ O my brother ! do not leave me ,</l>
       <l n="12">Lest the Evil Spirits harm you ! ”</l>
       <l n="13">Chibiabos , young and heedless ,</l>
       <l n="14">Laughing shook his coal-black tresses ,</l>
       <l n="15">Answered ever sweet and childlike ,</l>
       <l n="16">“ Do not fear for me , O brother !</l>
       <l n="17">Harm and evil come not near me ! ”</l>
       <l n="18">Once when Peboan , the Winter ,</l>
       <l n="19">Roofed with ice the Big-Sea-Water ,</l>
       <l n="20">When the snow-flakes , whirling downward ,</l>
       <l n="21">Hissed among the withered oak-leaves ,</l>
       <l n="22">Changed the pine-trees into wigwams ,</l>
       <l n="23">Covered all the earth with silence ,—</l>
       <l n="24">Armed with arrows , shod with snow-shoes ,</l>
       <l n="25">Heeding not his brother 's warning ,</l>
       <l n="26">Fearing not the Evil Spirits ,</l>
       <l n="27">Forth to hunt the deer with antlers</l>
       <l n="28">All alone went Chibiabos .</l>
       <l n="29">Right across the Big-Sea-Water</l>
       <l n="30">Sprang with speed the deer before him .</l>
       <l n="31">With the wind and snow he followed ,</l>
       <l n="32">O'er the treacherous ice he followed ,</l>
       <l n="33">Wild with all the fierce commotion</l>
       <l n="34">And the rapture of the hunting .</l>
       <l n="35">But beneath , the Evil Spirits</l>
       <l n="36">Lay in ambush , waiting for him ,</l>
       <l n="37">Broke the treacherous ice beneath him ,</l>
       <l n="38">Dragged him downward to the bottom ,</l>
       <l n="39">Buried in the sand his body .</l>
       <l n="40">Unktahee , the god of water ,</l>
       <l n="41">He the god of the Dacotahs ,</l>
       <l n="42">Drowned him in the deep abysses</l>
       <l n="43">Of the lake of Gitche Gumee .</l>
       <l n="44">From the headlands Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="45">Sent forth such a wail of anguish ,</l>
       <l n="46">Such a fearful lamentation ,</l>
       <l n="47">That the bison paused to listen ,</l>
       <l n="48">And the wolves howled from the prairies ,</l>
       <l n="49">And the thunder in the distance</l>
       <l n="50">Starting answered “ Baim-wawa ! ”</l>
       <l n="51">Then his face with black he painted ,</l>
       <l n="52">With his robe his head he covered ,</l>
       <l n="53">In his wigwam sat lamenting ,</l>
       <l n="54">Seven long weeks he sat lamenting ,</l>
       <l n="55">Uttering still this moan of sorrow :—</l>
       <l n="56">“ He is dead , the sweet musician !</l>
       <l n="57">He the sweetest of all singers !</l>
       <l n="58">He has gone from us forever ,</l>
       <l n="59">He has moved a little nearer</l>
       <l n="60">To the Master of all music ,</l>
       <l n="61">To the Master of all singing !</l>
       <l n="62">O my brother , Chibiabos ! ”</l>
       <l n="63">And the melancholy fir-trees</l>
       <l n="64">Waved their dark green fans above him ,</l>
       <l n="65">Waved their purple cones above him ,</l>
       <l n="66">Sighing with him to console him ,</l>
       <l n="67">Mingling with his lamentation</l>
       <l n="68">Their complaining , their lamenting .</l>
       <l n="69">Came the Spring , and all the forest</l>
       <l n="70">Looked in vain for Chibiabos ;</l>
       <l n="71">Sighed the rivulet , Sebowisha ,</l>
       <l n="72">Sighed the rushes in the meadow .</l>
       <l n="73">From the tree-tops sang the bluebird ,</l>
       <l n="74">Sang the bluebird , the Owaissa ,</l>
       <l n="75">“ Chibiabos ! Chibiabos !</l>
       <l n="76">He is dead , the sweet musician ! ”</l>
       <l n="77">From the wigwam sang the robin ,</l>
       <l n="78">Sang the robin , the Opechee ,</l>
       <l n="79">“ Chibiabos ! Chibiabos !</l>
       <l n="80">He is dead , the sweetest singer ! ”</l>
       <l n="81">And at night through all the forest</l>
       <l n="82">Went the whippoorwill complaining ,</l>
       <l n="83">Wailing went the Wawonaissa ,</l>
       <l n="84">“ Chibiabos ! Chibiabos !</l>
       <l n="85">He is dead , the sweet musician !</l>
       <l n="86">He the sweetest of all singers ! ”</l>
       <l n="87">Then the Medicine-men , the Medas ,</l>
       <l n="88">The magicians , the Wabenos ,</l>
       <l n="89">And the Jossakeeds , the Prophets ,</l>
       <l n="90">Came to visit Hiawatha ;</l>
       <l n="91">Built a Sacred Lodge beside him ,</l>
       <l n="92">To appease him , to console him ,</l>
       <l n="93">Walked in silent , grave procession ,</l>
       <l n="94">Bearing each a pouch of healing ,</l>
       <l n="95">Skin of beaver , lynx , or otter ,</l>
       <l n="96">Filled with magic roots and simples ,</l>
       <l n="97">Filled with very potent medicines .</l>
       <l n="98">When he heard their steps approaching ,</l>
       <l n="99">Hiawatha ceased lamenting ,</l>
       <l n="100">Called no more on Chibiabos ;</l>
       <l n="101">Naught he questioned , naught he answered ,</l>
       <l n="102">But his mournful head uncovered ,</l>
       <l n="103">From his face the mourning colors</l>
       <l n="104">Washed he slowly and in silence ,</l>
       <l n="105">Slowly and in silence followed</l>
       <l n="106">Onward to the Sacred Wigwam .</l>
       <l n="107">There a magic drink they gave him ,</l>
       <l n="108">Made of Nahma-wusk , the spearmint ,</l>
       <l n="109">And Wabeno-wusk , the yarrow ,</l>
       <l n="110">Roots of power , and herbs of healing ;</l>
       <l n="111">Beat their drums , and shook their rattles ;</l>
       <l n="112">Chanted singly and in chorus ,</l>
       <l n="113">Mystic songs like these , they chanted .</l>
       <l n="114">“ I myself , myself ! behold me !</l>
       <l n="115">‘ T is the great Gray Eagle talking ;</l>
       <l n="116">Come , ye white crows , come and hear him !</l>
       <l n="117">The loud-speaking thunder helps me ;</l>
       <l n="118">All the unseen spirits help me ;</l>
       <l n="119">I can hear their voices calling ,</l>
       <l n="120">All around the sky I hear them !</l>
       <l n="121">I can blow you strong , my brother ,</l>
       <l n="122">I can heal you , Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="123">“ Hi-au-ha ! ” replied the chorus ,</l>
       <l n="124">“ Way-ha-way ! ” the mystic chorus .</l>
       <l n="125">“ Friends of mine are all the serpents !</l>
       <l n="126">Hear me shake my skin of hen-hawk !</l>
       <l n="127">Mahng , the white loon , I can kill him ;</l>
       <l n="128">I can shoot your heart and kill it !</l>
       <l n="129">I can blow you strong , my brother ,</l>
       <l n="130">I can heal you , Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="131">“ Hi-au-ha ! ” replied the chorus ,</l>
       <l n="132">“ Way-ha-way ! ” the mystic chorus .</l>
       <l n="133">“ I myself , myself ! the prophet !</l>
       <l n="134">When I speak the wigwam trembles ,</l>
       <l n="135">Shakes the Sacred Lodge with terror ,</l>
       <l n="136">Hands unseen begin to shake it !</l>
       <l n="137">When I walk , the sky I tread on</l>
       <l n="138">Bends and makes a noise beneath me !</l>
       <l n="139">I can blow you strong , my brother !</l>
       <l n="140">Rise and speak , O Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="141">“ Hi-au-ha ! ” replied the chorus ,</l>
       <l n="142">“ Way-ha-way ! ” the mystic chorus .</l>
       <l n="143">Then they shook their medicine-pouches</l>
       <l n="144">O'er the head of Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="145">Danced their medicine-dance around him ;</l>
       <l n="146">And upstarting wild and haggard ,</l>
       <l n="147">Like a man from dreams awakened ,</l>
       <l n="148">He was healed of all his madness .</l>
       <l n="149">As the clouds are swept from heaven ,</l>
       <l n="150">Straightway from his brain departed</l>
       <l n="151">All his moody melancholy ;</l>
       <l n="152">As the ice is swept from rivers ,</l>
       <l n="153">Straightway from his heart departed</l>
       <l n="154">All his sorrow and affliction .</l>
       <l n="155">Then they summoned Chibiabos</l>
       <l n="156">From his grave beneath the waters ,</l>
       <l n="157">From the sands of Gitche Gumee</l>
       <l n="158">Summoned Hiawatha 's brother .</l>
       <l n="159">And so mighty was the magic</l>
       <l n="160">Of that cry and invocation ,</l>
       <l n="161">That he heard it as he lay there</l>
       <l n="162">Underneath the Big-Sea-Water ;</l>
       <l n="163">From the sand he rose and listened ,</l>
       <l n="164">Heard the music and the singing ,</l>
       <l n="165">Came , obedient to the summons ,</l>
       <l n="166">To the doorway of the wigwam ,</l>
       <l n="167">But to enter they forbade him .</l>
       <l n="168">Through a chink a coal they gave him ,</l>
       <l n="169">Through the door a burning fire-brand ;</l>
       <l n="170">Ruler in the Land of Spirits ,</l>
       <l n="171">Ruler o'er the dead , they made him ,</l>
       <l n="172">Telling him a fire to kindle</l>
       <l n="173">For all those that died thereafter ,</l>
       <l n="174">Camp-fires for their night encampments</l>
       <l n="175">On their solitary journey</l>
       <l n="176">To the kingdom of Ponemah ,</l>
       <l n="177">To the land of the Hereafter .</l>
       <l n="178">From the village of his childhood ,</l>
       <l n="179">From the homes of those who knew him ,</l>
       <l n="180">Passing silent through the forest ,</l>
       <l n="181">Like a smoke-wreath wafted sideways ,</l>
       <l n="182">Slowly vanished Chibiabos !</l>
       <l n="183">Where he passed , the branches moved not ,</l>
       <l n="184">Where he trod , the grasses bent not ,</l>
       <l n="185">And the fallen leaves of last year</l>
       <l n="186">Made no sound beneath his footstep .</l>
       <l n="187">Four whole days he journeyed onward</l>
       <l n="188">Down the pathway of the dead men ;</l>
       <l n="189">On the dead-man 's strawberry feasted ,</l>
       <l n="190">Crossed the melancholy river ,</l>
       <l n="191">On the swinging log he crossed it ,</l>
       <l n="192">Came unto the Lake of Silver ,</l>
       <l n="193">In the Stone Canoe was carried</l>
       <l n="194">To the Islands of the Blessed ,</l>
       <l n="195">To the land of ghosts and shadows .</l>
       <l n="196">On that journey , moving slowly ,</l>
       <l n="197">Many weary spirits saw he ,</l>
       <l n="198">Panting under heavy burdens ,</l>
       <l n="199">Laden with war-clubs , bows and arrows ,</l>
       <l n="200">Robes of fur , and pots and kettles ,</l>
       <l n="201">And with food that friends had given</l>
       <l n="202">For that solitary journey .</l>
       <l n="203">“ Ay ! why do the living , ” said they ,</l>
       <l n="204">“ Lay such heavy burdens on us !</l>
       <l n="205">Better were it to go naked ,</l>
       <l n="206">Better were it to go fasting ,</l>
       <l n="207">Than to bear such heavy burdens</l>
       <l n="208">On our long and weary journey ! ”</l>
       <l n="209">Forth then issued Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="210">Wandered eastward , wandered westward ,</l>
       <l n="211">Teaching men the use of simples</l>
       <l n="212">And the antidotes for poisons ,</l>
       <l n="213">And the cure of all diseases .</l>
       <l n="214">Thus was first made known to mortals</l>
       <l n="215">All the mystery of Medamin ,</l>
       <l n="216">All the sacred art of healing .</l>

       <l n="1">You shall hear how Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="2">He , the handsome Yenadizze ,</l>
       <l n="3">Whom the people called the Storm-Fool ,</l>
       <l n="4">Vexed the village with disturbance ;</l>
       <l n="5">You shall hear of all his mischief ,</l>
       <l n="6">And his flight from Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="7">And his wondrous transmigrations ,</l>
       <l n="8">And the end of his adventures .</l>
       <l n="9">On the shores of Gitche Gumee ,</l>
       <l n="10">On the dunes of Nagow Wudjoo ,</l>
       <l n="11">By the shining Big-Sea-Water</l>
       <l n="12">Stood the lodge of Pau-Puk-Keewis .</l>
       <l n="13">It was he who in his frenzy</l>
       <l n="14">Whirled these drifting sands together ,</l>
       <l n="15">On the dunes of Nagow Wudjoo ,</l>
       <l n="16">When , among the guests assembled ,</l>
       <l n="17">He so merrily and madly</l>
       <l n="18">Danced at Hiawatha 's wedding ,</l>
       <l n="19">Danced the Beggar 's Dance to please them .</l>
       <l n="20">Now , in search of new adventures ,</l>
       <l n="21">From his lodge went Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="22">Came with speed into the village ,</l>
       <l n="23">Found the young men all assembled</l>
       <l n="24">In the lodge of old Iagoo ,</l>
       <l n="25">Listening to his monstrous stories ,</l>
       <l n="26">To his wonderful adventures .</l>
       <l n="27">He was telling them the story</l>
       <l n="28">Of Ojeeg , the Summer-Maker ,</l>
       <l n="29">How he made a hole in heaven ,</l>
       <l n="30">How he climbed up into heaven ,</l>
       <l n="31">And let out the summer-weather ,</l>
       <l n="32">The perpetual , pleasant Summer ;</l>
       <l n="33">How the Otter first essayed it ;</l>
       <l n="34">How the Beaver , Lynx , and Badger</l>
       <l n="35">Tried in turn the great achievement ,</l>
       <l n="36">From the summit of the mountain</l>
       <l n="37">Smote their fists against the heavens ,</l>
       <l n="38">Smote against the sky their foreheads ,</l>
       <l n="39">Cracked the sky , but could not break it ;</l>
       <l n="40">How the Wolverine , uprising ,</l>
       <l n="41">Made him ready for the encounter ,</l>
       <l n="42">Bent his knees down , like a squirrel ,</l>
       <l n="43">Drew his arms back , like a cricket .</l>
       <l n="44">“ Once he leaped , ” said old Iagoo ,</l>
       <l n="45">“ Once he leaped , and lo ! above him</l>
       <l n="46">Bent the sky , as ice in rivers</l>
       <l n="47">When the waters rise beneath it ;</l>
       <l n="48">Twice he leaped , and lo ! above him</l>
       <l n="49">Cracked the sky , as ice in rivers</l>
       <l n="50">When the freshet is at highest !</l>
       <l n="51">Thrice he leaped , and lo ! above him</l>
       <l n="52">Broke the shattered sky asunder ,</l>
       <l n="53">And he disappeared within it ,</l>
       <l n="54">And Ojeeg , the Fisher Weasel ,</l>
       <l n="55">With a bound went in behind him ! ”</l>
       <l n="56">“ Hark you ! ” shouted Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
       <l n="57">As he entered at the doorway ;</l>
       <l n="58">“ I am tired of all this talking ,</l>
       <l n="59">Tired of old Iagoo 's stories ,</l>
       <l n="60">Tired of Hiawatha 's wisdom .</l>
       <l n="61">Here is something to amuse you ,</l>
       <l n="62">Better than this endless talking . ”</l>
       <l n="63">Then from out his pouch of wolf-skin</l>
       <l n="64">Forth he drew , with solemn manner ,</l>
       <l n="65">All the game of Bowl and Counters ,</l>
       <l n="66">Pugasaing , with thirteen pieces .</l>
       <l n="67">White on one side were they painted ,</l>
       <l n="68">And vermilion on the other ;</l>
       <l n="69">Two Kenabeeks or great serpents ,</l>
       <l n="70">Two Ininewug or wedge-men ,</l>
       <l n="71">One great war-club , Pugamaugun ,</l>
       <l n="72">And one slender fish , the Keego ,</l>
       <l n="73">Four round pieces , Ozawabeeks ,</l>
       <l n="74">And three Sheshebwug or ducklings .</l>
       <l n="75">All were made of bone and painted ,</l>
       <l n="76">All except the Ozawabeeks ;</l>
       <l n="77">These were brass , on one side burnished ,</l>
       <l n="78">And were black upon the other .</l>
       <l n="79">In a wooden bowl he placed them ,</l>
       <l n="80">Shook and jostled them together ,</l>
       <l n="81">Threw them on the ground before him ,</l>
       <l n="82">Thus exclaiming and explaining :</l>
       <l n="83">“ Red side up are all the pieces ,</l>
       <l n="84">And one great Kenabeek standing</l>
       <l n="85">On the bright side of a brass piece ,</l>
       <l n="86">On a burnished Ozawabeek ;</l>
       <l n="87">Thirteen tens and eight are counted . ”</l>
       <l n="88">Then again he shook the pieces ,</l>
       <l n="89">Shook and jostled them together ,</l>
       <l n="90">Threw them on the ground before him ,</l>
       <l n="91">Still exclaiming and explaining :</l>
       <l n="92">“ White are both the great Kenabeeks ,</l>
       <l n="93">White the Ininewug , the wedge-men ,</l>
       <l n="94">Red are all the other pieces ;</l>
       <l n="95">Five tens and an eight are counted . ”</l>
       <l n="96">Thus he taught the game of hazard ,</l>
       <l n="97">Thus displayed it and explained it ,</l>
       <l n="98">Running through its various chances ,</l>
       <l n="99">Various changes , various meanings :</l>
       <l n="100">Twenty curious eyes stared at him ,</l>
       <l n="101">Full of eagerness stared at him .</l>
       <l n="102">“ Many games , ” said old Iagoo ,</l>
       <l n="103">“ Many games of skill and hazard</l>
       <l n="104">Have I seen in different nations ,</l>
       <l n="105">Have I played in different countries .</l>
       <l n="106">He who plays with old Iagoo</l>
       <l n="107">Must have very nimble fingers ;</l>
       <l n="108">Though you think yourself so skilful ,</l>
       <l n="109">I can beat you , Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="110">I can even give you lessons</l>
       <l n="111">In your game of Bowl and Counters ! ”</l>
       <l n="112">So they sat and played together ,</l>
       <l n="113">All the old men and the young men ,</l>
       <l n="114">Played for dresses , weapons , wampum ,</l>
       <l n="115">Played till midnight , played till morning ,</l>
       <l n="116">Played until the Yenadizze ,</l>
       <l n="117">Till the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="118">Of their treasures had despoiled them ,</l>
       <l n="119">Of the best of all their dresses ,</l>
       <l n="120">Shirts of deer-skin , robes of ermine ,</l>
       <l n="121">Belts of wampum , crests of feathers ,</l>
       <l n="122">Warlike weapons , pipes and pouches .</l>
       <l n="123">Twenty eyes glared wildly at him ,</l>
       <l n="124">Like the eyes of wolves glared at him .</l>
       <l n="125">Said the lucky Pau-Puk-Keewis :</l>
       <l n="126">“ In my wigwam I am lonely ,</l>
       <l n="127">In my wanderings and adventures</l>
       <l n="128">I have need of a companion ,</l>
       <l n="129">Fain would have a Meshinauwa ,</l>
       <l n="130">An attendant and pipe-bearer .</l>
       <l n="131">I will venture all these winnings ,</l>
       <l n="132">All these garments heaped about me ,</l>
       <l n="133">All this wampum , all these feathers ,</l>
       <l n="134">On a single throw will venture</l>
       <l n="135">All against the young man yonder ! ”</l>
       <l n="136">‘ T was a youth of sixteen summers ,</l>
       <l n="137">‘ T was a nephew of Iagoo ;</l>
       <l n="138">Face-in-a-Mist , the people called him .</l>
       <l n="139">As the fire burns in a pipe-head</l>
       <l n="140">Dusky red beneath the ashes ,</l>
       <l n="141">So beneath his shaggy eyebrows</l>
       <l n="142">Glowed the eyes of old Iagoo .</l>
       <l n="143">“ Ugh ! ” he answered very fiercely ;</l>
       <l n="144">“ Ugh ! ” they answered all and each one .</l>
       <l n="145">Seized the wooden bowl the old man ,</l>
       <l n="146">Closely in his bony fingers</l>
       <l n="147">Clutched the fatal bowl , Onagon ,</l>
       <l n="148">Shook it fiercely and with fury ,</l>
       <l n="149">Made the pieces ring together</l>
       <l n="150">As he threw them down before him .</l>
       <l n="151">Red were both the great Kenabeeks ,</l>
       <l n="152">Red the Ininewug , the wedge-men ,</l>
       <l n="153">Red the Sheshebwug , the ducklings ,</l>
       <l n="154">Black the four brass Ozawabeeks ,</l>
       <l n="155">White alone the fish , the Keego ;</l>
       <l n="156">Only five the pieces counted !</l>
       <l n="157">Then the smiling Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
       <l n="158">Shook the bowl and threw the pieces ;</l>
       <l n="159">Lightly in the air he tossed them ,</l>
       <l n="160">And they fell about him scattered ;</l>
       <l n="161">Dark and bright the Ozawabeeks ,</l>
       <l n="162">Red and white the other pieces ,</l>
       <l n="163">And upright among the others</l>
       <l n="164">One Ininewug was standing ,</l>
       <l n="165">Even as crafty Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
       <l n="166">Stood alone among the players ,</l>
       <l n="167">Saying , “ Five tens ! mine the game is ! ”</l>
       <l n="168">Twenty eyes glared at him fiercely ,</l>
       <l n="169">Like the eyes of wolves glared at him ,</l>
       <l n="170">As he turned and left the wigwam ,</l>
       <l n="171">Followed by his Meshinauwa ,</l>
       <l n="172">By the nephew of Iagoo ,</l>
       <l n="173">By the tall and graceful stripling ,</l>
       <l n="174">Bearing in his arms the winnings ,</l>
       <l n="175">Shirts of deer-skin , robes of ermine ,</l>
       <l n="176">Belts of wampum , pipes and weapons .</l>
       <l n="177">“ Carry them , ” said Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="178">Pointing with his fan of feathers ,</l>
       <l n="179">“ To my wigwam far to eastward ,</l>
       <l n="180">On the dunes of Nagow Wudjoo ! ”</l>
       <l n="181">Hot and red with smoke and gambling</l>
       <l n="182">Were the eyes of Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
       <l n="183">As he came forth to the freshness</l>
       <l n="184">Of the pleasant Summer morning .</l>
       <l n="185">All the birds were singing gayly ,</l>
       <l n="186">All the streamlets flowing swiftly ,</l>
       <l n="187">And the heart of Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
       <l n="188">Sang with pleasure as the birds sing ,</l>
       <l n="189">Beat with triumph like the streamlets ,</l>
       <l n="190">As he wandered through the village ,</l>
       <l n="191">In the early gray of morning ,</l>
       <l n="192">With his fan of turkey-feathers ,</l>
       <l n="193">With his plumes and tufts of swan 's down ,</l>
       <l n="194">Till he reached the farthest wigwam ,</l>
       <l n="195">Reached the lodge of Hiawatha .</l>
       <l n="196">Silent was it and deserted ;</l>
       <l n="197">No one met him at the doorway ,</l>
       <l n="198">No one came to bid him welcome ;</l>
       <l n="199">But the birds were singing round it ,</l>
       <l n="200">In and out and round the doorway ,</l>
       <l n="201">Hopping , singing , fluttering , feeding ,</l>
       <l n="202">And aloft upon the ridge-pole</l>
       <l n="203">Kahgahgee , the King of Ravens ,</l>
       <l n="204">Sat with fiery eyes , and , screaming ,</l>
       <l n="205">Flapped his wings at Pau-Puk-Keewis .</l>
       <l n="206">“ All are gone ! the lodge is empty ! ”</l>
       <l n="207">Thus it was spake Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="208">In his heart resolving mischief ;—</l>
       <l n="209">“ Gone is wary Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="210">Gone the silly Laughing Water ,</l>
       <l n="211">Gone Nokomis , the old woman ,</l>
       <l n="212">And the lodge is left unguarded ! ”</l>
       <l n="213">By the neck he seized the raven ,</l>
       <l n="214">Whirled it round him like a rattle ,</l>
       <l n="215">Like a medicine-pouch he shook it ,</l>
       <l n="216">Strangled Kahgahgee , the raven ,</l>
       <l n="217">From the ridge-pole of the wigwam</l>
       <l n="218">Left its lifeless body hanging ,</l>
       <l n="219">As an insult to its master ,</l>
       <l n="220">As a taunt to Hiawatha .</l>
       <l n="221">With a stealthy step he entered ,</l>
       <l n="222">Round the lodge in wild disorder</l>
       <l n="223">Threw the household things about him ,</l>
       <l n="224">Piled together in confusion</l>
       <l n="225">Bowls of wood and earthen kettles ,</l>
       <l n="226">Robes of buffalo and beaver ,</l>
       <l n="227">Skins of otter , lynx , and ermine ,</l>
       <l n="228">As an insult to Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="229">As a taunt to Minnehaha .</l>
       <l n="230">Then departed Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="231">Whistling , singing through the forest ,</l>
       <l n="232">Whistling gayly to the squirrels ,</l>
       <l n="233">Who from hollow boughs above him</l>
       <l n="234">Dropped their acorn-shells upon him ,</l>
       <l n="235">Singing gayly to the wood birds ,</l>
       <l n="236">Who from out the leafy darkness</l>
       <l n="237">Answered with a song as merry .</l>
       <l n="238">Then he climbed the rocky headlands ,</l>
       <l n="239">Looking o'er the Gitche Gumee ,</l>
       <l n="240">Perched himself upon their summit ,</l>
       <l n="241">Waiting full of mirth and mischief</l>
       <l n="242">The return of Hiawatha .</l>
       <l n="243">Stretched upon his back he lay there ;</l>
       <l n="244">Far below him plashed the waters ,</l>
       <l n="245">Plashed and washed the dreamy waters ;</l>
       <l n="246">Far above him swam the heavens ,</l>
       <l n="247">Swam the dizzy , dreamy heavens ;</l>
       <l n="248">Round him hovered , fluttered , rustled</l>
       <l n="249">Hiawatha 's mountain chickens ,</l>
       <l n="250">Flock-wise swept and wheeled about him ,</l>
       <l n="251">Almost brushed him with their pinions .</l>
       <l n="252">And he killed them as he lay there ,</l>
       <l n="253">Slaughtered them by tens and twenties ,</l>
       <l n="254">Threw their bodies down the headland ,</l>
       <l n="255">Threw them on the beach below him ,</l>
       <l n="256">Till at length Kayoshk , the sea-gull ,</l>
       <l n="257">Perched upon a crag above them ,</l>
       <l n="258">Shouted : “ It is Pau-Puk-Keewis !</l>
       <l n="259">He is slaying us by hundreds !</l>
       <l n="260">Send a message to our brother ,</l>
       <l n="261">Tidings send to Hiawatha ! ”</l>

      <head>THE HUNTING OF PAU-PUK-KEEWIS</head>
       <l n="1">Full of wrath was Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="2">When he came into the village ,</l>
       <l n="3">Found the people in confusion ,</l>
       <l n="4">Heard of all the misdemeanors ,</l>
       <l n="5">All the malice and the mischief ,</l>
       <l n="6">Of the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis .</l>
       <l n="7">Hard his breath came through his nostrils ,</l>
       <l n="8">Through his teeth he buzzed and muttered</l>
       <l n="9">Words of anger and resentment ,</l>
       <l n="10">Hot and humming , like a hornet .</l>
       <l n="11">“ I will slay this Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="12">Slay this mischief-maker ! ” said he .</l>
       <l n="13">“ Not so long and wide the world is ,</l>
       <l n="14">Not so rude and rough the way is ,</l>
       <l n="15">That my wrath shall not attain him ,</l>
       <l n="16">That my vengeance shall not reach him ! ”</l>
       <l n="17">Then in swift pursuit departed</l>
       <l n="18">Hiawatha and the hunters</l>
       <l n="19">On the trail of Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="20">Through the forest , where he passed it ,</l>
       <l n="21">To the headlands where he rested ;</l>
       <l n="22">But they found not Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="23">Only in the trampled grasses ,</l>
       <l n="24">In the whortleberry-bushes ,</l>
       <l n="25">Found the couch where he had rested ,</l>
       <l n="26">Found the impress of his body .</l>
       <l n="27">From the lowlands far beneath them ,</l>
       <l n="28">From the Muskoday , the meadow ,</l>
       <l n="29">Pau-Puk-Keewis , turning backward ,</l>
       <l n="30">Made a gesture of defiance ,</l>
       <l n="31">Made a gesture of derision ;</l>
       <l n="32">And aloud cried Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="33">From the summit of the mountains :</l>
       <l n="34">“ Not so long and wide the world is ,</l>
       <l n="35">Not so rude and rough the way is ,</l>
       <l n="36">But my wrath shall overtake you ,</l>
       <l n="37">And my vengeance shall attain you ! ”</l>
       <l n="38">Over rock and over river ,</l>
       <l n="39">Through bush , and brake , and forest ,</l>
       <l n="40">Ran the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis ;</l>
       <l n="41">Like an antelope he bounded ,</l>
       <l n="42">Till he came unto a streamlet</l>
       <l n="43">In the middle of the forest ,</l>
       <l n="44">To a streamlet still and tranquil ,</l>
       <l n="45">That had overflowed its margin ,</l>
       <l n="46">To a dam made by the beavers ,</l>
       <l n="47">To a pond of quiet water ,</l>
       <l n="48">Where knee-deep the trees were standing ,</l>
       <l n="49">Where the water lilies floated ,</l>
       <l n="50">Where the rushes waved and whispered .</l>
       <l n="51">On the dam stood Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="52">On the dam of trunks and branches ,</l>
       <l n="53">Through whose chinks the water spouted ,</l>
       <l n="54">O'er whose summit flowed the streamlet .</l>
       <l n="55">From the bottom rose the beaver ,</l>
       <l n="56">Looked with two great eyes of wonder ,</l>
       <l n="57">Eyes that seemed to ask a question ,</l>
       <l n="58">At the stranger , Pau-Puk-Keewis .</l>
       <l n="59">On the dam stood Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="60">O'er his ankles flowed the streamlet ,</l>
       <l n="61">Flowed the bright and silvery water ,</l>
       <l n="62">And he spake unto the beaver ,</l>
       <l n="63">With a smile he spake in this wise :</l>
       <l n="64">“ O my friend Ahmeek , the beaver ,</l>
       <l n="65">Cool and pleasant is the water ;</l>
       <l n="66">Let me dive into the water ,</l>
       <l n="67">Let me rest there in your lodges ;</l>
       <l n="68">Change me , too , into a beaver ! ”</l>
       <l n="69">Cautiously replied the beaver ,</l>
       <l n="70">With reserve he thus made answer :</l>
       <l n="71">“ Let me first consult the others ,</l>
       <l n="72">Let me ask the other beavers . ”</l>
       <l n="73">Down he sank into the water ,</l>
       <l n="74">Heavily sank he , as a stone sinks ,</l>
       <l n="75">Down among the leaves and branches ,</l>
       <l n="76">Brown and matted at the bottom .</l>
       <l n="77">On the dam stood Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="78">O'er his ankles flowed the streamlet ,</l>
       <l n="79">Spouted through the chinks below him ,</l>
       <l n="80">Dashed upon the stones beneath him ,</l>
       <l n="81">Spread serene and calm before him ,</l>
       <l n="82">And the sunshine and the shadows</l>
       <l n="83">Fell in flecks and gleams upon him ,</l>
       <l n="84">Fell in little shining patches ,</l>
       <l n="85">Through the waving , rustling branches .</l>
       <l n="86">From the bottom rose the beavers ,</l>
       <l n="87">Silently above the surface</l>
       <l n="88">Rose one head and then another ,</l>
       <l n="89">Till the pond seemed full of beavers ,</l>
       <l n="90">Full of black and shining faces .</l>
       <l n="91">To the beavers Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
       <l n="92">Spake entreating , said in this wise :</l>
       <l n="93">“ Very pleasant is your dwelling ,</l>
       <l n="94">O my friends ! and safe from danger ;</l>
       <l n="95">Can you not , with all your cunning ,</l>
       <l n="96">All your wisdom and contrivance ,</l>
       <l n="97">Change me , too , into a beaver ? ”</l>
       <l n="98">“ Yes ! ” replied Ahmeek , the beaver ,</l>
       <l n="99">He the King of all the beavers ,</l>
       <l n="100">“ Let yourself slide down among us ,</l>
       <l n="101">Down into the tranquil water . ”</l>
       <l n="102">Down into the pond among them</l>
       <l n="103">Silently sank Pau-Puk-Keewis ;</l>
       <l n="104">Black became his shirt of deer-skin ,</l>
       <l n="105">Black his moccasins and leggings ,</l>
       <l n="106">In a broad black tail behind him</l>
       <l n="107">Spread his fox-tails and his fringes ;</l>
       <l n="108">He was changed into a beaver .</l>
       <l n="109">“ Make me large , ” said Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="110">“ Make me large and make me larger ,</l>
       <l n="111">Larger than the other beavers . ”</l>
       <l n="112">“ Yes , ” the beaver chief responded ,</l>
       <l n="113">“ When our lodge below you enter ,</l>
       <l n="114">In our wigwam we will make you</l>
       <l n="115">Ten times larger than the others . ”</l>
       <l n="116">Thus into the clear , brown water</l>
       <l n="117">Silently sank Pau-Puk-Keewis :</l>
       <l n="118">Found the bottom covered over</l>
       <l n="119">With the trunks of trees and branches ,</l>
       <l n="120">Hoards of food against the winter ,</l>
       <l n="121">Piles and heaps against the famine ;</l>
       <l n="122">Found the lodge with arching doorway ,</l>
       <l n="123">Leading into spacious chambers .</l>
       <l n="124">Here they made him large and larger ,</l>
       <l n="125">Made him largest of the beavers ,</l>
       <l n="126">Ten times larger than the others .</l>
       <l n="127">“ You shall be our ruler , ” said they ;</l>
       <l n="128">“ Chief and King of all the beavers . ”</l>
       <l n="129">But not long had Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
       <l n="130">Sat in state among the beavers ,</l>
       <l n="131">When there came a voice of warning</l>
       <l n="132">From the watchman at his station</l>
       <l n="133">In the water-flags and lilies ,</l>
       <l n="134">Saying , “ Here Is Hiawatha !</l>
       <l n="135">Hiawatha with his hunters ! ”</l>
       <l n="136">Then they heard a cry above them ,</l>
       <l n="137">Heard a shouting and a tramping ,</l>
       <l n="138">Heard a crashing and a rushing ,</l>
       <l n="139">And the water round and o'er them</l>
       <l n="140">Sank and sucked away in eddies ,</l>
       <l n="141">And they knew their dam was broken .</l>
       <l n="142">On the lodge 's roof the hunters</l>
       <l n="143">Leaped , and broke it all asunder ;</l>
       <l n="144">Streamed the sunshine through the crevice ,</l>
       <l n="145">Sprang the beavers through the doorway ,</l>
       <l n="146">Hid themselves in deeper water ,</l>
       <l n="147">In the channel of the streamlet ;</l>
       <l n="148">But the mighty Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
       <l n="149">Could not pass beneath the doorway ;</l>
       <l n="150">He was puffed with pride and feeding ,</l>
       <l n="151">He was swollen like a bladder .</l>
       <l n="152">Through the roof looked Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="153">Cried aloud , “ O Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
       <l n="154">Vain are all your craft and cunning ,</l>
       <l n="155">Vain your manifold disguises !</l>
       <l n="156">Well I know you , Pau-Puk-Keewis ! ”</l>
       <l n="157">With their clubs they beat and bruised him ,</l>
       <l n="158">Beat to death poor Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="159">Pounded him as maize is pounded ,</l>
       <l n="160">Till his skull was crushed to pieces .</l>
       <l n="161">Six tall hunters , lithe and limber ,</l>
       <l n="162">Bore him home on poles and branches ,</l>
       <l n="163">Bore the body of the beaver ;</l>
       <l n="164">But the ghost , the Jeebi in him ,</l>
       <l n="165">Thought and felt as Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="166">Still lived on as Pau-Puk-Keewis .</l>
       <l n="167">And it fluttered , strove , and struggled ,</l>
       <l n="168">Waving hither , waving thither ,</l>
       <l n="169">As the curtains of a wigwam</l>
       <l n="170">Struggle with their thongs of deer-skin ,</l>
       <l n="171">When the wintry wind is blowing ;</l>
       <l n="172">Till it drew itself together ,</l>
       <l n="173">Till it rose up from the body ,</l>
       <l n="174">Till it took the form and features</l>
       <l n="175">Of the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
       <l n="176">Vanishing into the forest .</l>
       <l n="177">But the wary Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="178">Saw the figure ere it vanished ,</l>
       <l n="179">Saw the form of Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
       <l n="180">Glide into the soft blue shadow</l>
       <l n="181">Of the pine-trees of the forest ;</l>
       <l n="182">Toward the squares of white beyond it ,</l>
       <l n="183">Toward an opening in the forest .</l>
       <l n="184">Like a wind it rushed and panted ,</l>
       <l n="185">Bending all the boughs before it ,</l>
       <l n="186">And behind it , as the rain comes ,</l>
       <l n="187">Came the steps of Hiawatha .</l>
       <l n="188">To a lake with many islands</l>
       <l n="189">Came the breathless Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="190">Where among the water-lilies</l>
       <l n="191">Pishnekuh , the brant , were sailing ;</l>
       <l n="192">Through the tufts of rushes floating ,</l>
       <l n="193">Steering through the reedy islands .</l>
       <l n="194">Now their broad black beaks they lifted ,</l>
       <l n="195">Now they plunged beneath the water ,</l>
       <l n="196">Now they darkened in the shadow ,</l>
       <l n="197">Now they brightened in the sunshine .</l>
       <l n="198">“ Pishnekuh ! ” cried Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="199">“ Pishnekuh ! my brothers ! ” said he ,</l>
       <l n="200">“ Change me to a brant with plumage ,</l>
       <l n="201">With a shining neck and feathers ,</l>
       <l n="202">Make me large , and make me larger ,</l>
       <l n="203">Ten times larger than the others . ”</l>
       <l n="204">Straightway to a brant they changed him ,</l>
       <l n="205">With two huge and dusky pinions ,</l>
       <l n="206">With a bosom smooth and rounded ,</l>
       <l n="207">With a bill like two great paddles ,</l>
       <l n="208">Made him larger than the others ,</l>
       <l n="209">Ten times larger than the largest ,</l>
       <l n="210">Just as , shouting from the forest ,</l>
       <l n="211">On the shore stood Hiawatha .</l>
       <l n="212">Up they rose with cry and clamor ,</l>
       <l n="213">With a whir and beat of pinions ,</l>
       <l n="214">Rose up from the reedy Islands ,</l>
       <l n="215">From the water-flags and lilies .</l>
       <l n="216">And they said to Pau-Puk-Keewis :</l>
       <l n="217">“ In your flying , look not downward ,</l>
       <l n="218">Take good heed and look not downward ,</l>
       <l n="219">Lest some strange mischance should happen ,</l>
       <l n="220">Lest some great mishap befall you ! ”</l>
       <l n="221">Fast and far they fled to northward ,</l>
       <l n="222">Fast and far through mist and sunshine ,</l>
       <l n="223">Fed among the moors and fen-lands ,</l>
       <l n="224">Slept among the reeds and rushes .</l>
       <l n="225">On the morrow as they journeyed ,</l>
       <l n="226">Buoyed and lifted by the South-wind ,</l>
       <l n="227">Wafted onward by the South-wind ,</l>
       <l n="228">Blowing fresh and strong behind them ,</l>
       <l n="229">Rose a sound of human voices ,</l>
       <l n="230">Rose a clamor from beneath them ,</l>
       <l n="231">From the lodges of a village ,</l>
       <l n="232">From the people miles beneath them .</l>
       <l n="233">For the people of the village</l>
       <l n="234">Saw the flock of brant with wonder ,</l>
       <l n="235">Saw the wings of Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
       <l n="236">Flapping far up in the ether ,</l>
       <l n="237">Broader than two doorway curtains .</l>
       <l n="238">Pau-Puk-Keewis heard the shouting ,</l>
       <l n="239">Knew the voice of Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="240">Knew the outcry of Iagoo ,</l>
       <l n="241">And , forgetful of the warning ,</l>
       <l n="242">Drew his neck in , and looked downward ,</l>
       <l n="243">And the wind that blew behind him</l>
       <l n="244">Caught his mighty fan of feathers ,</l>
       <l n="245">Sent him wheeling , whirling downward !</l>
       <l n="246">All in vain did Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
       <l n="247">Struggle to regain his balance !</l>
       <l n="248">Whirling round and round and downward ,</l>
       <l n="249">He beheld in turn the village</l>
       <l n="250">And in turn the flock above him ,</l>
       <l n="251">Saw the village coming nearer ,</l>
       <l n="252">And the flock receding farther ,</l>
       <l n="253">Heard the voices growing louder ,</l>
       <l n="254">Heard the shouting and the laughter ;</l>
       <l n="255">Saw no more the flocks above him ,</l>
       <l n="256">Only saw the earth beneath him ;</l>
       <l n="257">Dead out of the empty heaven ,</l>
       <l n="258">Dead among the shouting people ,</l>
       <l n="259">With a heavy sound and sullen ,</l>
       <l n="260">Fell the brant with broken pinions .</l>
       <l n="261">But his soul , his ghost , his shadow ,</l>
       <l n="262">Still survived as Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="263">Took again the form and features</l>
       <l n="264">Of the handsome Yenadizze ,</l>
       <l n="265">And again went rushing onward ,</l>
       <l n="266">Followed fast by Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="267">Crying : “ Not so wide the world is ,</l>
       <l n="268">Not so long and rough the way is ,</l>
       <l n="269">But my wrath shall overtake you ,</l>
       <l n="270">But my vengeance shall attain you ! ”</l>
       <l n="271">And so near he came , so near him ,</l>
       <l n="272">That his hand was stretched to seize him ,</l>
       <l n="273">His right hand to seize and hold him ,</l>
       <l n="274">When the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
       <l n="275">Whirled and spun about in circles ,</l>
       <l n="276">Fanned the air into a whirlwind ,</l>
       <l n="277">Danced the dust and leaves about him ,</l>
       <l n="278">And amid the whirling eddies</l>
       <l n="279">Sprang into a hollow oak-tree ,</l>
       <l n="280">Changed himself into a serpent ,</l>
       <l n="281">Gliding out through root and rubbish .</l>
       <l n="282">With his right hand Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="283">Smote amain the hollow oak-tree ,</l>
       <l n="284">Rent it into shreds and splinters ,</l>
       <l n="285">Left it lying there in fragments .</l>
       <l n="286">But in vain ; for Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="287">Once again in human figure ,</l>
       <l n="288">Full in sight ran on before him ,</l>
       <l n="289">Sped away in gust and whirlwind ,</l>
       <l n="290">On the shores of Gitche Gumee ,</l>
       <l n="291">Westward by the Big-Sea-Water ,</l>
       <l n="292">Came unto the rocky headlands ,</l>
       <l n="293">To the Pictured Rocks of sandstone ,</l>
       <l n="294">Looking over lake and landscape .</l>
       <l n="295">And the Old Man of the Mountain ,</l>
       <l n="296">He the Manito of Mountains ,</l>
       <l n="297">Opened wide his rocky doorways ,</l>
       <l n="298">Opened wide his deep abysses ,</l>
       <l n="299">Giving Pau-Puk-Keewis shelter</l>
       <l n="300">In his caverns dark and dreary ,</l>
       <l n="301">Bidding Pau-Puk-Keewis welcome</l>
       <l n="302">To his gloomy lodge of sandstone .</l>
       <l n="303">There without stood Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="304">Found the doorways closed against him ,</l>
       <l n="305">With his mittens , Minjekahwun ,</l>
       <l n="306">Smote great caverns in the sandstone ,</l>
       <l n="307">Cried aloud in tones of thunder ,</l>
       <l n="308">“ Open ! I am Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="309">But the Old Man of the Mountain</l>
       <l n="310">Opened not , and made no answer</l>
       <l n="311">From the silent crags of sandstone ,</l>
       <l n="312">From the gloomy rock abysses .</l>
       <l n="313">Then he raised his hands to heaven ,</l>
       <l n="314">Called imploring on the tempest ,</l>
       <l n="315">Called Waywassimo , the lightning ,</l>
       <l n="316">And the thunder , Annemeekee ;</l>
       <l n="317">And they came with night and darkness ,</l>
       <l n="318">Sweeping down the Big-Sea-Water</l>
       <l n="319">From the distant Thunder Mountains ;</l>
       <l n="320">And the trembling Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
       <l n="321">Heard the footsteps of the thunder ,</l>
       <l n="322">Saw the red eyes of the lightning ,</l>
       <l n="323">Was afraid , and crouched and trembled .</l>
       <l n="324">Then Waywassimo , the lightning ,</l>
       <l n="325">Smote the doorways of the caverns ,</l>
       <l n="326">With his war-club smote the doorways ,</l>
       <l n="327">Smote the jutting crags of sandstone ,</l>
       <l n="328">And the thunder , Annemeekee ,</l>
       <l n="329">Shouted down into the caverns ,</l>
       <l n="330">Saying , “ Where is Pau-Puk-Keewis ! ”</l>
       <l n="331">And the crags fell , and beneath them</l>
       <l n="332">Dead among the rocky ruins</l>
       <l n="333">Lay the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="334">Lay the handsome Yenadizze ,</l>
       <l n="335">Slain in his own human figure .</l>
       <l n="336">Ended were his wild adventures ,</l>
       <l n="337">Ended were his tricks and gambols ,</l>
       <l n="338">Ended all his craft and cunning ,</l>
       <l n="339">Ended all his mischief-making ,</l>
       <l n="340">All his gambling and his dancing ,</l>
       <l n="341">All his wooing of the maidens .</l>
       <l n="342">Then the noble Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="343">Took his soul , his ghost , his shadow ,</l>
       <l n="344">Spake and said : “ O Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
       <l n="345">Never more in human figure</l>
       <l n="346">Shall you search for new adventures ;</l>
       <l n="347">Never more with jest and laughter</l>
       <l n="348">Dance the dust and leaves in whirlwinds ;</l>
       <l n="349">But above there in the heavens</l>
       <l n="350">You shall soar and sail in circles ;</l>
       <l n="351">I will change you to an eagle ,</l>
       <l n="352">To Keneu , the great war-eagle ,</l>

       <l n="355">And the name of Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
       <l n="356">Lingers still among the people ,</l>
       <l n="357">Lingers still among the singers ,</l>
       <l n="358">And among the story-tellers ;</l>
       <l n="359">And in Winter , when the snow-flakes</l>
       <l n="360">Whirl in eddies round the lodges ,</l>
       <l n="361">When the wind in gusty tumult</l>
       <l n="362">O'er the smoke-flue pipes and whistles ,</l>

      <head>THE DEATH OF KWASIND</head>
       <l n="1">Far and wide among the nations</l>
       <l n="2">Spread the name and fame of Kwasind ;</l>
       <l n="3">No man dared to strive with Kwasind ,</l>
       <l n="4">No man could compete with Kwasind .</l>
       <l n="5">But the mischievous Puk-Wudjies ,</l>
       <l n="6">They the envious Little People ,</l>
       <l n="7">They the fairies and the pygmies ,</l>
       <l n="8">Plotted and conspired against him .</l>
       <l n="9">“ If this hateful Kwasind , ” said they ,</l>
       <l n="10">“ If this great , outrageous fellow</l>
       <l n="11">Goes on thus a little longer ,</l>
       <l n="12">Tearing everything he touches ,</l>
       <l n="13">Rending everything to pieces ,</l>
       <l n="14">Filling all the world with wonder ,</l>
       <l n="15">What becomes of the Puk-Wudjies ?</l>
       <l n="16">Who will care for the Puk-Wudjies ?</l>
       <l n="17">He will tread us down like mushrooms ,</l>
       <l n="18">Drive us all into the water ,</l>
       <l n="19">Give our bodies to be eaten</l>
       <l n="20">By the wicked Nee-ba-naw-baigs ,</l>
       <l n="21">By the Spirits of the water !</l>
       <l n="22">So the angry Little People</l>
       <l n="23">All conspired against the Strong Man ,</l>
       <l n="24">All conspired to murder Kwasind ,</l>
       <l n="25">Yes , to rid the world of Kwasind ,</l>
       <l n="26">The audacious , overbearing ,</l>
       <l n="27">Heartless , haughty , dangerous Kwasind !</l>
       <l n="28">Now this wondrous strength of Kwasind</l>
       <l n="29">In his crown alone was seated ;</l>
       <l n="30">In his crown too was his weakness ;</l>
       <l n="31">There alone could he be wounded ,</l>
       <l n="32">Nowhere else could weapon pierce him ,</l>
       <l n="33">Nowhere else could weapon harm him .</l>
       <l n="34">Even there the only weapon</l>
       <l n="35">That could wound him , that could slay him ,</l>
       <l n="36">Was the seed-cone of the pine-tree ,</l>
       <l n="37">Was the blue cone of the fir-tree .</l>
       <l n="38">This was Kwasind 's fatal secret ,</l>
       <l n="39">Known to no man among mortals ;</l>
       <l n="40">But the cunning Little People ,</l>
       <l n="41">The Puk-Wudjies , knew the secret ,</l>
       <l n="42">Knew the only way to kill him .</l>
       <l n="43">So they gathered cones together ,</l>
       <l n="44">Gathered seed-cones of the pine-tree ,</l>
       <l n="45">Gathered blue cones of the fir-tree ,</l>
       <l n="46">In the woods by Taquamenaw ,</l>
       <l n="47">Brought them to the river 's margin ,</l>
       <l n="48">Heaped them in great piles together ,</l>
       <l n="49">Where the red rocks from the margin</l>
       <l n="50">Jutting overhang the river .</l>
       <l n="51">There they lay in wait for Kwasind ,</l>
       <l n="52">The malicious Little People .</l>
       <l n="53">‘ T was an afternoon in Summer ;</l>
       <l n="54">Very hot and still the air was ,</l>
       <l n="55">Very smooth the gliding river ,</l>
       <l n="56">Motionless the sleeping shadows :</l>
       <l n="57">Insects glistened in the sunshine ,</l>
       <l n="58">Insects skated on the water ,</l>
       <l n="59">Filled the drowsy air with buzzing ,</l>
       <l n="60">With a far resounding war-cry .</l>
       <l n="61">Down the river came the Strong Man ,</l>
       <l n="62">In his birch canoe came Kwasind ,</l>
       <l n="63">Floating slowly down the current</l>
       <l n="64">Of the sluggish Taquamenaw ,</l>
       <l n="65">Very languid with the weather ,</l>
       <l n="66">Very sleepy with the silence .</l>
       <l n="67">From the overhanging branches ,</l>
       <l n="68">From the tassels of the birch-trees ,</l>
       <l n="69">Soft the Spirit of Sleep descended ;</l>
       <l n="70">By his airy hosts surrounded ,</l>
       <l n="71">His invisible attendants ,</l>
       <l n="72">Came the Spirit of Sleep , Nepahwin ;</l>
       <l n="73">Like a burnished Dush-kwo-ne-she ,</l>
       <l n="74">Like a dragon-fly , he hovered</l>
       <l n="75">O'er the drowsy head of Kwasind .</l>
       <l n="76">To his ear there came a murmur</l>
       <l n="77">As of waves upon a sea-shore ,</l>
       <l n="78">As of far-off tumbling waters ,</l>
       <l n="79">As of winds among the pine-trees ;</l>
       <l n="80">And he felt upon his forehead</l>
       <l n="81">Blows of little airy war-clubs ,</l>
       <l n="82">Wielded by the slumbrous legions</l>
       <l n="83">Of the Spirit of Sleep , Nepahwin ,</l>
       <l n="84">As of some one breathing on him .</l>
       <l n="85">At the first blow of their war-clubs ,</l>
       <l n="86">Fell a drowsiness on Kwasind ;</l>
       <l n="87">At the second blow they smote him ,</l>
       <l n="88">Motionless his paddle rested ;</l>
       <l n="89">At the third , before his vision</l>
       <l n="90">Reeled the landscape into darkness ,</l>
       <l n="91">Very sound asleep was Kwasind .</l>
       <l n="92">So he floated down the river ,</l>
       <l n="93">Like a blind man seated upright ,</l>
       <l n="94">Floated down the Taquamenaw ,</l>
       <l n="95">Underneath the trembling birch-trees ,</l>
       <l n="96">Underneath the wooded headlands ,</l>
       <l n="97">Underneath the war encampment</l>
       <l n="98">Of the pygmies , the Puk-Wudjies .</l>
       <l n="99">There they stood , all armed and waiting ,</l>
       <l n="100">Hurled the pine-cones down upon him ,</l>
       <l n="101">Struck him on his brawny shoulders ,</l>
       <l n="102">On his crown defenceless struck him .</l>
       <l n="103">“ Death to Kwasind ! ” was the sudden</l>
       <l n="104">War-cry of the Little People .</l>
       <l n="105">And he sideways swayed and tumbled ,</l>
       <l n="106">Sideways fell into the river ,</l>
       <l n="107">Plunged beneath the sluggish water</l>
       <l n="108">Headlong , as an otter plunges ;</l>
       <l n="109">And the birch canoe , abandoned ,</l>
       <l n="110">Drifted empty down the river ,</l>
       <l n="111">Bottom upward swerved and drifted :</l>
       <l n="112">Nothing more was seen of Kwasind .</l>
       <l n="113">But the memory of the Strong Man</l>
       <l n="114">Lingered long among the people ,</l>
       <l n="115">And whenever through the forest</l>
       <l n="116">Raged and roared the wintry tempest ,</l>
       <l n="117">And the branches , tossed and troubled ,</l>
       <l n="118">Creaked and groaned and split asunder ,</l>
       <l n="119">“ Kwasind ! ” cried they ; “ that is Kwasind !</l>
       <l n="120">He is gathering in his fire-wood ! ”</l>

       <l n="5">From his high aerial look-out ,</l>

       <l n="15">Follow , follow , gathering flock-wise</l>
       <l n="16">Round their victim , sick and wounded ,</l>
       <l n="17">First a shadow , then a sorrow ,</l>
       <l n="18">Till the air is dark with anguish .</l>
       <l n="19">Now , o'er all the dreary North-land ,</l>
       <l n="20">Mighty Peboan , the Winter ,</l>
       <l n="21">Breathing on the lakes and rivers ,</l>
       <l n="22">Into stone had changed their waters .</l>
       <l n="23">From his hair he shook the snow-flakes ,</l>
       <l n="24">Till the plains were strewn with whiteness ,</l>
       <l n="25">One uninterrupted level ,</l>
       <l n="26">As if , stooping , the Creator</l>
       <l n="27">With his hand had smoothed them over .</l>
       <l n="28">Through the forest , wide and wailing ,</l>
       <l n="29">Roamed the hunter on his snow-shoes ;</l>
       <l n="30">In the village worked the women ,</l>
       <l n="31">Pounded maize , or dressed the deer-skin ;</l>
       <l n="32">And the young men played together</l>
       <l n="33">On the ice the noisy ball-play ,</l>
       <l n="34">On the plain the dance of snow-shoes .</l>
       <l n="35">One dark evening , after sundown ,</l>
       <l n="36">In her wigwam Laughing Water</l>
       <l n="37">Sat with old Nokomis , waiting</l>
       <l n="38">For the steps of Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="39">Homeward from the hunt returning .</l>
       <l n="40">On their faces gleamed the firelight ,</l>
       <l n="41">Painting them with streaks of crimson ,</l>
       <l n="42">In the eyes of old Nokomis</l>
       <l n="43">Glimmered like the watery moonlight ,</l>
       <l n="44">In the eyes of Laughing Water</l>
       <l n="45">Glistened like the sun in water ;</l>
       <l n="46">And behind them crouched their shadows</l>
       <l n="47">In the corners of the wigwam ,</l>
       <l n="48">And the smoke in wreaths above them</l>
       <l n="49">Climbed and crowded through the smoke-flue .</l>
       <l n="50">Then the curtain of the doorway</l>
       <l n="51">From without was slowly lifted ;</l>
       <l n="52">Brighter glowed the fire a moment ,</l>
       <l n="53">And a moment swerved the smoke-wreath ,</l>
       <l n="54">As two women entered softly ,</l>
       <l n="55">Passed the doorway uninvited ,</l>
       <l n="56">Without word of salutation ,</l>
       <l n="57">Without sign of recognition ,</l>
       <l n="58">Sat down in the farthest corner ,</l>
       <l n="59">Crouching low among the shadows .</l>
       <l n="60">From their aspect and their garments ,</l>
       <l n="61">Strangers seemed they in the village ;</l>
       <l n="62">Very pale and haggard were they ,</l>
       <l n="63">As they sat there sad and silent ,</l>
       <l n="64">Trembling , cowering with the shadows .</l>
       <l n="65">Was it the wind above the smoke-flue ,</l>
       <l n="66">Muttering down into the wigwam ?</l>
       <l n="67">Was it the owl , the Koko-koho ,</l>
       <l n="68">Hooting from the dismal forest ?</l>
       <l n="69">Sure a voice said in the silence :</l>
       <l n="70">“ These are corpses clad in garments ,</l>
       <l n="71">These are ghosts that come to haunt you ,</l>
       <l n="72">From the kingdom of Ponemah ,</l>
       <l n="73">From the land of the Hereafter ! ”</l>
       <l n="74">Homeward now came Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="75">From his hunting in the forest ,</l>
       <l n="76">With the snow upon his tresses ,</l>
       <l n="77">And the red deer on his shoulders .</l>
       <l n="78">At the feet of Laughing Water</l>
       <l n="79">Down he threw his lifeless burden ;</l>
       <l n="80">Nobler , handsomer she thought him ,</l>
       <l n="81">Than when first he came to woo her ,</l>
       <l n="82">First threw down the deer before her ,</l>
       <l n="83">As a token of his wishes ,</l>
       <l n="84">As a promise of the future .</l>
       <l n="85">Then he turned and saw the strangers ,</l>
       <l n="86">Cowering , crouching with the shadows ;</l>
       <l n="87">Said within himself , “ Who are they ?</l>
       <l n="88">What strange guests has Minnehaha ? ”</l>
       <l n="89">But he questioned not the strangers ,</l>
       <l n="90">Only spake to bid them welcome</l>
       <l n="91">To his lodge , his food , his fireside .</l>
       <l n="92">When the evening meal was ready ,</l>
       <l n="93">And the deer had been divided ,</l>
       <l n="94">Both the pallid guests , the strangers ,</l>
       <l n="95">Springing from among the shadows ,</l>
       <l n="96">Seized upon the choicest portions ,</l>
       <l n="97">Seized the white fat of the roebuck ,</l>
       <l n="98">Set apart for Laughing Water ,</l>
       <l n="99">For the wife of Hiawatha ;</l>
       <l n="100">Without asking , without thanking ,</l>
       <l n="101">Eagerly devoured the morsels ,</l>
       <l n="102">Flitted back among the shadows</l>
       <l n="103">In the corner of the wigwam .</l>
       <l n="104">Not a word spake Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="105">Not a motion made Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="106">Not a gesture Laughing Water ;</l>
       <l n="107">Not a change came o'er their features ;</l>
       <l n="108">Only Minnehaha softly</l>
       <l n="109">Whispered , saying , “ They are famished ;</l>
       <l n="110">Let them do what best delights them ;</l>
       <l n="111">Let them eat , for they are famished . ”</l>
       <l n="112">Many a daylight dawned and darkened ,</l>
       <l n="113">Many a night shook off the daylight</l>
       <l n="114">As the pine shakes off the snow-flakes</l>
       <l n="115">From the midnight of its branches ;</l>
       <l n="116">Day by day the guests unmoving</l>
       <l n="117">Sat there silent in the wigwam ;</l>
       <l n="118">But by night , in storm or starlight ,</l>
       <l n="119">Forth they went into the forest ,</l>
       <l n="120">Bringing fire-wood to the wigwam ,</l>
       <l n="121">Bringing pine-cones for the burning ,</l>
       <l n="122">Always sad and always silent .</l>
       <l n="123">And whenever Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="124">Came from fishing or from hunting ,</l>
       <l n="125">When the evening meal was ready ,</l>
       <l n="126">And the food had been divided ,</l>
       <l n="127">Gliding from their darksome corner ,</l>
       <l n="128">Came the pallid guests , the strangers ,</l>
       <l n="129">Seized upon the choicest portions</l>
       <l n="130">Set aside for Laughing Water ,</l>
       <l n="131">And without rebuke or question</l>
       <l n="132">Flitted back among the shadows .</l>
       <l n="133">Never once had Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="134">By a word or look reproved them ;</l>
       <l n="135">Never once had old Nokomis</l>
       <l n="136">Made a gesture of impatience ;</l>
       <l n="137">Never once had Laughing Water</l>
       <l n="138">Shown resentment at the outrage .</l>
       <l n="139">All had they endured in silence ,</l>
       <l n="140">That the rights of guest and stranger ,</l>
       <l n="141">That the virtue of free-giving ,</l>
       <l n="142">By a look might not be lessened ,</l>
       <l n="143">By a word might not be broken .</l>
       <l n="144">Once at midnight Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="145">Ever wakeful , ever watchful ,</l>
       <l n="146">In the wigwam , dimly lighted</l>
       <l n="147">By the brands that still were burning ,</l>
       <l n="148">By the glimmering , flickering firelight</l>
       <l n="149">Heard a sighing , oft repeated ,</l>
       <l n="150">Heard a sobbing , as of sorrow .</l>
       <l n="151">From his couch rose Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="152">From his shaggy hides of bison ,</l>
       <l n="153">Pushed aside the deer-skin curtain ,</l>
       <l n="154">Saw the pallid guests , the shadows ,</l>
       <l n="155">Sitting upright on their couches ,</l>
       <l n="156">Weeping in the silent midnight .</l>
       <l n="157">And he said : “ O guests ! why is it</l>
       <l n="158">That your hearts are so afflicted ,</l>
       <l n="159">That you sob so in the midnight ?</l>
       <l n="160">Has perchance the old Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="161">Has my wife , my Minnehaha ,</l>
       <l n="162">Wronged or grieved you by unkindness ,</l>
       <l n="163">Failed in hospitable duties ? ”</l>
       <l n="164">Then the shadows ceased from weeping ,</l>
       <l n="165">Ceased from sobbing and lamenting ,</l>
       <l n="166">And they said , with gentle voices :</l>
       <l n="167">“ We are ghosts of the departed ,</l>
       <l n="168">Souls of those who once were with you .</l>
       <l n="169">From the realms of Chibiabos</l>
       <l n="170">Hither have we come to try you ,</l>
       <l n="171">Hither have we come to warn you .</l>
       <l n="172">“ Cries of grief and lamentation</l>
       <l n="173">Reach us in the Blessed Islands ;</l>
       <l n="174">Cries of anguish from the living ,</l>
       <l n="175">Calling back their friends departed ,</l>
       <l n="176">Sadden us with useless sorrow .</l>
       <l n="177">Therefore have we come to try you ;</l>
       <l n="178">No one knows us , no one heeds us .</l>
       <l n="179">We are but a burden to you ,</l>
       <l n="180">And we see that the departed</l>
       <l n="181">Have no place among the living .</l>
       <l n="182">“ Think of this , O Hiawatha !</l>
       <l n="183">Speak of it to all the people ,</l>
       <l n="184">That henceforward and forever</l>
       <l n="185">They no more with lamentations</l>
       <l n="186">Sadden the souls of the departed</l>
       <l n="187">In the Islands of the Blessed .</l>
       <l n="188">“ Do not lay such heavy burdens</l>
       <l n="189">In the graves of those you bury ,</l>
       <l n="190">Not such weight of furs and wampum ,</l>
       <l n="191">Not such weight of pots and kettles ,</l>
       <l n="192">For the spirits faint beneath them .</l>
       <l n="193">Only give them food to carry ,</l>
       <l n="194">Only give them fire to light them .</l>
       <l n="195">“ Four days is the spirit 's journey</l>
       <l n="196">To the land of ghosts and shadows ,</l>
       <l n="197">Four its lonely night encampments ;</l>
       <l n="198">Four times must their fires be lighted .</l>
       <l n="199">Therefore , when the dead are buried ,</l>
       <l n="200">Let a fire , as night approaches ,</l>
       <l n="201">Four times on the grave be kindled ,</l>
       <l n="202">That the soul upon its journey</l>
       <l n="203">May not lack the cheerful firelight ,</l>
       <l n="204">May not grope about in darkness .</l>
       <l n="205">“ Farewell , noble Hiawatha !</l>
       <l n="206">We have put you to the trial ,</l>
       <l n="207">To the proof have put your patience ,</l>
       <l n="208">By the insult of our presence ,</l>
       <l n="209">By the outrage of our actions .</l>
       <l n="210">We have found you great and noble .</l>
       <l n="211">Fail not in the greater trial ,</l>
       <l n="212">Faint not in the harder struggle . ”</l>
       <l n="213">When they ceased , a sudden darkness</l>
       <l n="214">Fell and filled the silent wigwam .</l>
       <l n="215">Hiawatha heard a rustle</l>
       <l n="216">As of garments trailing by him ,</l>
       <l n="217">Heard the curtain of the doorway</l>
       <l n="218">Lifted by a hand he saw not ,</l>
       <l n="219">Felt the cold breath of the night air ,</l>
       <l n="220">For a moment saw the starlight ;</l>
       <l n="221">But he saw the ghosts no longer ,</l>
       <l n="222">Saw no more the wandering spirits</l>
       <l n="223">From the kingdom of Ponemah ,</l>
       <l n="224">From the land of the Hereafter .</l>

      <head>THE FAMINE</head>
       <l n="1">Oh the long and dreary Winter !</l>
       <l n="2">Oh the cold and cruel Winter !</l>
       <l n="3">Ever thicker , thicker , thicker</l>
       <l n="4">Froze the ice on lake and river ,</l>
       <l n="5">Ever deeper , deeper , deeper</l>
       <l n="6">Fell the snow o'er all the landscape ,</l>
       <l n="7">Fell the covering snow , and drifted</l>
       <l n="8">Through the forest , round the village .</l>
       <l n="9">Hardly from his buried wigwam</l>
       <l n="10">Could the hunter force a passage ;</l>
       <l n="11">With his mittens and his snow-shoes</l>
       <l n="12">Vainly walked he through the forest ,</l>
       <l n="13">Sought for bird or beast and found none ,</l>
       <l n="14">Saw no track of deer or rabbit ,</l>
       <l n="15">In the snow beheld no footprints ,</l>
       <l n="16">In the ghastly , gleaming forest</l>
       <l n="17">Fell , and could not rise from weakness ,</l>
       <l n="18">Perished there from cold and hunger .</l>
       <l n="19">Oh the famine and the fever !</l>
       <l n="20">Oh the wasting of the famine !</l>
       <l n="21">Oh the blasting of the fever !</l>

       <l n="23">Oh the anguish of the women !</l>
       <l n="24">All the earth was sick and famished ;</l>
       <l n="25">Hungry was the air around them ,</l>
       <l n="26">Hungry was the sky above them ,</l>
       <l n="27">And the hungry stars in heaven</l>
       <l n="28">Like the eyes of wolves glared at them !</l>
       <l n="29">Into Hiawatha 's wigwam</l>
       <l n="30">Came two other guests , as silent</l>
       <l n="31">As the ghosts were , and as gloomy ,</l>
       <l n="32">Waited not to be invited</l>
       <l n="33">Did not parley at the doorway</l>
       <l n="34">Sat there without word of welcome</l>
       <l n="35">In the seat of Laughing Water ;</l>
       <l n="36">Looked with haggard eyes and hollow</l>
       <l n="37">At the face of Laughing Water .</l>
       <l n="38">And the foremost said : “ Behold me !</l>
       <l n="39">I am Famine , Bukadawin ! ”</l>
       <l n="40">And the other said : “ Behold me !</l>
       <l n="41">I am Fever , Ahkosewin ! ”</l>
       <l n="42">And the lovely Minnehaha</l>
       <l n="43">Shuddered as they looked upon her ,</l>
       <l n="44">Shuddered at the words they uttered ,</l>
       <l n="45">Lay down on her bed in silence ,</l>
       <l n="46">Hid her face , but made no answer ;</l>
       <l n="47">Lay there trembling , freezing , burning</l>
       <l n="48">At the looks they cast upon her ,</l>
       <l n="49">At the fearful words they uttered .</l>
       <l n="50">Forth into the empty forest</l>
       <l n="51">Rushed the maddened Hiawatha ;</l>
       <l n="52">In his heart was deadly sorrow ,</l>
       <l n="53">In his face a stony firmness ;</l>
       <l n="54">On his brow the sweat of anguish</l>
       <l n="55">Started , but it froze and fell not .</l>
       <l n="56">Wrapped in furs and armed for hunting ,</l>
       <l n="57">With his mighty bow of ash-tree ,</l>
       <l n="58">With his quiver full of arrows ,</l>
       <l n="59">With his mittens , Minjekahwun ,</l>
       <l n="60">Into the vast and vacant forest</l>
       <l n="61">On his snow-shoes strode he forward .</l>
       <l n="62">“ Gitche Manito , the Mighty ! ”</l>
       <l n="63">Cried he with his face uplifted</l>
       <l n="64">In that bitter hour of anguish ,</l>
       <l n="65">“ Give your children food , O father !</l>

       <l n="67">Give me food for Minnehaha ,</l>
       <l n="68">For my dying Minnehaha ! ”</l>
       <l n="69">Through the far-resounding forest ,</l>
       <l n="70">Through the forest vast and vacant</l>
       <l n="71">Rang that cry of desolation ,</l>
       <l n="72">But there came no other answer</l>
       <l n="73">Than the echo of his crying ,</l>
       <l n="74">Than the echo of the woodlands ,</l>
       <l n="75">“ Minnehaha ! Minnehaha ! ”</l>
       <l n="76">All day long roved Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="77">In that melancholy forest ,</l>
       <l n="78">Through the shadow of whose thickets ,</l>
       <l n="79">In the pleasant days of Summer ,</l>
       <l n="80">Of that ne'er forgotten Summer ,</l>
       <l n="81">He had brought his young wife homeward</l>
       <l n="82">From the land of the Dacotahs ;</l>
       <l n="83">When the birds sang in the thickets ,</l>
       <l n="84">And the streamlets laughed and glistened ,</l>
       <l n="85">And the air was full of fragrance ,</l>
       <l n="86">And the lovely Laughing Water</l>
       <l n="87">Said with voice that did not tremble ,</l>
       <l n="88">“ I will follow you , my husband ! ”</l>
       <l n="89">In the wigwam with Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="90">With those gloomy guests that watched her ,</l>
       <l n="91">With the Famine and the Fever ,</l>
       <l n="92">She was lying , the Beloved ,</l>
       <l n="93">She , the dying Minnehaha .</l>
       <l n="94">“ Hark ! ” she said ; “ I hear a rushing ,</l>
       <l n="95">Hear a roaring and a rushing ,</l>
       <l n="96">Hear the Falls of Minnehaha</l>
       <l n="97">Calling to me from a distance ! ”</l>
       <l n="98">“ No , my child ! ” said old Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="99">“ ‘ T is the night-wind in the pine-trees ! ”</l>
       <l n="100">“ Look ! ” she said ; “ I see my father</l>
       <l n="101">Standing lonely at his doorway ,</l>
       <l n="102">Beckoning to me from his wigwam</l>
       <l n="103">In the land of the Dacotahs ! ”</l>
       <l n="104">“ No , my child ! ” said old Nokomis .</l>
       <l n="105">“ ‘ T is the smoke , that waves and beckons ! ”</l>
       <l n="106">“ Ah ! ” said she , “ the eyes of Pauguk</l>
       <l n="107">Glare upon me in the darkness ,</l>
       <l n="108">I can feel his icy fingers</l>
       <l n="109">Clasping mine amid the darkness !</l>
       <l n="110">Hiawatha ! Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="111">And the desolate Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="112">Far away amid the forest ,</l>
       <l n="113">Miles away among the mountains ,</l>
       <l n="114">Heard that sudden cry of anguish ,</l>
       <l n="115">Heard the voice of Minnehaha</l>
       <l n="116">Calling to him in the darkness ,</l>
       <l n="117">“ Hiawatha ! Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="118">Over snow-fields waste and pathless ,</l>
       <l n="119">Under snow-encumbered branches ,</l>
       <l n="120">Homeward hurried Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="121">Empty-handed , heavy-hearted ,</l>
       <l n="122">Heard Nokomis moaning , wailing :</l>
       <l n="123">“ Wahonowin ! Wahonowin !</l>
       <l n="124">Would that I had perished for you ,</l>
       <l n="125">Would that I were dead as you are !</l>
       <l n="126">Wahonowin ! Wahonowin ! ”</l>
       <l n="127">And he rushed into the wigwam ,</l>
       <l n="128">Saw the old Nokomis slowly</l>
       <l n="129">Rocking to and fro and moaning ,</l>
       <l n="130">Saw his lovely Minnehaha</l>
       <l n="131">Lying dead and cold before him ,</l>
       <l n="132">And his bursting heart within him</l>
       <l n="133">Uttered such a cry of anguish ,</l>
       <l n="134">That the forest moaned and shuddered ,</l>
       <l n="135">That the very stars in heaven</l>
       <l n="136">Shook and trembled with his anguish .</l>
       <l n="137">Then he sat down , still and speechless ,</l>
       <l n="138">On the bed of Minnehaha ,</l>
       <l n="139">At the feet of Laughing Water ,</l>
       <l n="140">At those willing feet , that never</l>
       <l n="141">More would lightly run to meet him ,</l>
       <l n="142">Never more would lightly follow .</l>
       <l n="143">With both hands his face he covered ,</l>
       <l n="144">Seven long days and nights he sat there ,</l>
       <l n="145">As if in a swoon he sat there ,</l>
       <l n="146">Speechless , motionless , unconscious</l>
       <l n="147">Of the daylight or the darkness .</l>
       <l n="148">Then they buried Minnehaha ;</l>
       <l n="149">In the snow a grave they made her</l>
       <l n="150">In the forest deep and darksome</l>
       <l n="151">Underneath the moaning hemlocks ;</l>
       <l n="152">Clothed her in her richest garments</l>
       <l n="153">Wrapped her in her robes of ermine ,</l>
       <l n="154">Covered her with snow , like ermine ;</l>
       <l n="155">Thus they buried Minnehaha .</l>
       <l n="156">And at night a fire was lighted ,</l>
       <l n="157">On her grave four times was kindled ,</l>
       <l n="158">For her soul upon its journey</l>
       <l n="159">To the Islands of the Blessed .</l>
       <l n="160">From his doorway Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="161">Saw it burning in the forest ,</l>
       <l n="162">Lighting up the gloomy hemlocks ;</l>
       <l n="163">From his sleepless bed uprising ,</l>
       <l n="164">From the bed of Minnehaha ,</l>
       <l n="165">Stood and watched it at the doorway ,</l>
       <l n="166">That it might not be extinguished ,</l>
       <l n="167">Might not leave her in the darkness .</l>
       <l n="168">“ Farewell ! ” said he , “ Minnehaha !</l>
       <l n="169">Farewell , O my Laughing Water !</l>
       <l n="170">All my heart is buried with you ,</l>
       <l n="171">All my thoughts go onward with you !</l>
       <l n="172">Come not back again to labor ,</l>
       <l n="173">Come not back again to suffer ,</l>
       <l n="174">Where the Famine and the Fever</l>
       <l n="175">Wear the heart and waste the body .</l>
       <l n="176">Soon my task will be completed ,</l>
       <l n="177">Soon your footsteps I shall follow</l>
       <l n="178">To the Islands of the Blessed ,</l>
       <l n="179">To the Kingdom of Ponemah ,</l>
       <l n="180">To the Land of the Hereafter ! ”</l>

      <head>THE WHITE MAN 'S FOOT</head>
       <l n="1">In his lodge beside a river ,</l>
       <l n="2">Close beside a frozen river ,</l>
       <l n="3">Sat an old man , sad and lonely .</l>
       <l n="4">White his hair was as a snow-drift ;</l>
       <l n="5">Dull and low his fire was burning ,</l>
       <l n="6">And the old man shook and trembled ,</l>
       <l n="7">Folded in his Waubewyon ,</l>
       <l n="8">In his tattered white-skin-wrapper ,</l>
       <l n="9">Hearing nothing but the tempest</l>
       <l n="10">As it roared along the forest ,</l>
       <l n="11">Seeing nothing but the snow-storm ,</l>
       <l n="12">As it whirled and hissed and drifted .</l>
       <l n="13">All the coals were white with ashes ,</l>
       <l n="14">And the fire was slowly dying ,</l>
       <l n="15">As a young man , walking lightly ,</l>
       <l n="16">At the open doorway entered .</l>
       <l n="17">Red with blood of youth his cheeks were ,</l>
       <l n="18">Soft his eyes , as stars in Spring-time ,</l>
       <l n="19">Bound his forehead was with grasses ;</l>
       <l n="20">Bound and plumed with scented grasses ,</l>
       <l n="21">On his lips a smile of beauty ,</l>
       <l n="22">Filling all the lodge with sunshine ,</l>
       <l n="23">In his hand a bunch of blossoms</l>
       <l n="24">Filling all the lodge with sweetness .</l>
       <l n="25">“ Ah , my son ! ” exclaimed the old man ,</l>
       <l n="26">“ Happy are my eyes to see you .</l>
       <l n="27">Sit here on the mat beside me ,</l>
       <l n="28">Sit here by the dying embers ,</l>
       <l n="29">Let us pass the night together ,</l>
       <l n="30">Tell me of your strange adventures ,</l>
       <l n="31">Of the lands where you have travelled ;</l>
       <l n="32">I will tell you of my prowess ,</l>
       <l n="33">Of my many deeds of wonder . ”</l>
       <l n="34">From his pouch he drew his peace-pipe ,</l>
       <l n="35">Very old and strangely fashioned ;</l>
       <l n="36">Made of red stone was the pipe-head ,</l>
       <l n="37">And the stem a reed with feathers ;</l>
       <l n="38">Filled the pipe with bark of willow ,</l>
       <l n="39">Placed a burning coal upon it ,</l>
       <l n="40">Gave it to his guest , the stranger ,</l>
       <l n="41">And began to speak in this wise :</l>
       <l n="42">“ When I blow my breath about me ,</l>
       <l n="43">When I breathe upon the landscape ,</l>
       <l n="44">Motionless are all the rivers ,</l>
       <l n="45">Hard as stone becomes the water ! ”</l>
       <l n="46">And the young man answered , smiling :</l>
       <l n="47">“ When I blow my breath about me ,</l>
       <l n="48">When I breathe upon the landscape ,</l>
       <l n="49">Flowers spring up o'er all the meadows ,</l>
       <l n="50">Singing , onward rush the rivers ! ”</l>
       <l n="51">“ When I shake my hoary tresses , ”</l>
       <l n="52">Said the old man darkly frowning ,</l>
       <l n="53">“ All the land with snow is covered ;</l>
       <l n="54">All the leaves from all the branches</l>
       <l n="55">Fall and fade and die and wither ,</l>
       <l n="56">For I breathe , and lo ! they are not .</l>
       <l n="57">From the waters and the marshes ,</l>
       <l n="58">Rise the wild goose and the heron ,</l>
       <l n="59">Fly away to distant regions ,</l>
       <l n="60">For I speak , and lo ! they are not .</l>
       <l n="61">And where'er my footsteps wander ,</l>
       <l n="62">All the wild beasts of the forest</l>
       <l n="63">Hide themselves in holes and caverns ,</l>
       <l n="64">And the earth becomes as flintstone ! ”</l>
       <l n="65">“ When I shake my flowing ringlets , ”</l>
       <l n="66">Said the young man , softly laughing ,</l>
       <l n="67">“ Showers of rain fall warm and welcome ,</l>
       <l n="68">Plants lift up their heads rejoicing ,</l>
       <l n="69">Back into their lakes and marshes</l>
       <l n="70">Come the wild goose and the heron ,</l>
       <l n="71">Homeward shoots the arrowy swallow ,</l>
       <l n="72">Sing the bluebird and the robin ,</l>
       <l n="73">And where'er my footsteps wander ,</l>
       <l n="74">All the meadows wave with blossoms ,</l>
       <l n="75">All the woodlands ring with music ,</l>
       <l n="76">All the trees are dark with foliage ! ”</l>
       <l n="77">While they spake , the night departed :</l>
       <l n="78">From the distant realms of Wabun ,</l>
       <l n="79">From his shining lodge of silver ,</l>
       <l n="80">Like a warrior robed and painted ,</l>
       <l n="81">Came the sun , and said , “ Behold me</l>
       <l n="82">Gheezis , the great sun , behold me ! ”</l>
       <l n="83">Then the old man 's tongue was speechless</l>
       <l n="84">And the air grew warm and pleasant ,</l>
       <l n="85">And upon the wigwam sweetly</l>
       <l n="86">Sang the bluebird and the robin ,</l>
       <l n="87">And the stream began to murmur ,</l>
       <l n="88">And a scent of growing grasses</l>
       <l n="89">Through the lodge was gently wafted .</l>
       <l n="90">And Segwun , the youthful stranger ,</l>
       <l n="91">More distinctly in the daylight</l>
       <l n="92">Saw the icy face before him ;</l>
       <l n="93">It was Peboan , the Winter !</l>
       <l n="94">From his eyes the tears were flowing ,</l>
       <l n="95">As from melting lakes the streamlets ,</l>
       <l n="96">And his body shrunk and dwindled</l>
       <l n="97">As the shouting sun ascended ,</l>
       <l n="98">Till into the air it faded ,</l>
       <l n="99">Till into the ground it vanished ,</l>
       <l n="100">And the young man saw before him ,</l>
       <l n="101">On the hearth-stone of the wigwam ,</l>
       <l n="102">Where the fire had smoked and smouldered ,</l>
       <l n="103">Saw the earliest flower of Spring-time ,</l>
       <l n="104">Saw the Beauty of the Spring-time ,</l>
       <l n="105">Saw the Miskodeed in blossom .</l>
       <l n="106">Thus it was that in the North-land</l>
       <l n="107">After that unheard-of coldness ,</l>
       <l n="108">That intolerable Winter ,</l>
       <l n="109">Came the Spring with all its splendor ,</l>
       <l n="110">All its birds and all its blossoms ,</l>
       <l n="111">All its flowers and leaves and grasses .</l>
       <l n="112">Sailing on the wind to northward ,</l>
       <l n="113">Flying in great flocks , like arrows ,</l>
       <l n="114">Like huge arrows shot through heaven ,</l>
       <l n="115">Passed the swan , the Mahnahbezee ,</l>
       <l n="116">Speaking almost as a man speaks ;</l>
       <l n="117">And in long lines waving , bending</l>
       <l n="118">Like a bow-string snapped asunder ,</l>
       <l n="119">Came the white goose , Waw-be-wawa ;</l>
       <l n="120">And in pairs , or singly flying ,</l>
       <l n="121">Mahng the loon , with clangorous pinions ,</l>
       <l n="122">The blue heron , the Shuh-shuh-gah ,</l>
       <l n="123">And the grouse , the Mushkodasa .</l>
       <l n="124">In the thickets and the meadows</l>
       <l n="125">Piped the bluebird , the Owaissa ,</l>
       <l n="126">On the summit of the lodges</l>
       <l n="127">Sang the robin , the Opechee ,</l>
       <l n="128">In the covert of the pine-trees</l>
       <l n="129">Cooed the pigeon , the Omemee ;</l>
       <l n="130">And the sorrowing Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="131">Speechless in his infinite sorrow ,</l>
       <l n="132">Heard their voices calling to him ,</l>
       <l n="133">Went forth from his gloomy doorway ,</l>
       <l n="134">Stood and gazed into the heaven ,</l>
       <l n="135">Gazed upon the earth and waters .</l>
       <l n="136">From his wanderings far to eastward ,</l>
       <l n="137">From the regions of the morning ,</l>
       <l n="138">From the shining land of Wabun ,</l>
       <l n="139">Homeward now returned Iagoo ,</l>
       <l n="140">The great traveller , the great boaster ,</l>
       <l n="141">Full of new and strange adventures ,</l>
       <l n="142">Marvels many and many wonders .</l>
       <l n="143">And the people of the village</l>
       <l n="144">Listened to him as he told them</l>
       <l n="145">Of his marvellous adventures ,</l>
       <l n="146">Laughing answered him in this wise :</l>
       <l n="147">“ Ugh ! it is indeed Iagoo !</l>
       <l n="148">No one else beholds such wonders ! ”</l>
       <l n="149">He had seen , he said , a water</l>
       <l n="150">Bigger than the Big-Sea-Water ,</l>
       <l n="151">Broader than the Gitche Gumee ,</l>
       <l n="152">Bitter so that none could drink it !</l>
       <l n="153">At each other looked the warriors ,</l>
       <l n="154">Looked the women at each other ,</l>
       <l n="155">Smiled , and said , “ It cannot be so ! ”</l>
       <l n="156">Kaw ! ” they said , it cannot be so ! ”</l>
       <l n="157">O'er it , said he , o'er this water</l>
       <l n="158">Came a great canoe with pinions ,</l>
       <l n="159">A canoe with wings came flying ,</l>
       <l n="160">Bigger than a grove of pine-trees ,</l>
       <l n="161">Taller than the tallest tree-tops !</l>
       <l n="162">And the old men and the women</l>
       <l n="163">Looked and tittered at each other ;</l>
       <l n="164">“ Kaw ! ” they said , “ we do n't believe it ! ”</l>
       <l n="165">From its mouth , he said , to greet him ,</l>
       <l n="166">Came Waywassimo , the lightning ,</l>
       <l n="167">Came the thunder , Annemeekee !</l>
       <l n="168">And the warriors and the women</l>
       <l n="169">Laughed aloud at poor Iagoo ;</l>
       <l n="170">“ Kaw ! ” they said , “ what tales you tell us ! ”</l>
       <l n="171">In it , said he , came a people ,</l>
       <l n="172">In the great canoe with pinions</l>
       <l n="173">Came , he said , a hundred warriors ;</l>
       <l n="174">Painted white were all their faces</l>
       <l n="175">And with hair their chins were covered !</l>
       <l n="176">And the warriors and the women</l>
       <l n="177">Laughed and shouted in derision ,</l>
       <l n="178">Like the ravens on the tree-tops ,</l>
       <l n="179">Like the crows upon the hemlocks .</l>
       <l n="180">“ Kaw ! ” they said , “ what lies you tell us !</l>
       <l n="181">Do not think that we believe them ! ”</l>
       <l n="182">Only Hiawatha laughed not ,</l>
       <l n="183">But he gravely spake and answered</l>
       <l n="184">To their jeering and their jesting :</l>
       <l n="185">“ True is all Iagoo tells us ;</l>
       <l n="186">I have seen it in a vision ,</l>
       <l n="187">Seen the great canoe with pinions ,</l>
       <l n="188">Seen the people with white faces ,</l>
       <l n="189">Seen the coming of this bearded</l>
       <l n="190">People of the wooden vessel</l>
       <l n="191">From the regions of the morning ,</l>
       <l n="192">From the shining land of Wabun .</l>
       <l n="193">“ Gitche Manito , the Mighty ,</l>
       <l n="194">The Great Spirit , the Creator ,</l>
       <l n="195">Sends them hither on his errand .</l>
       <l n="196">Sends them to us with his message .</l>
       <l n="197">Wheresoe'er they move , before them</l>
       <l n="198">Swarms the stinging fly , the Ahmo ,</l>
       <l n="199">Swarms the bee , the honey-maker ;</l>
       <l n="200">Wheresoe'er they tread , beneath them</l>
       <l n="201">Springs a flower unknown among us ,</l>
       <l n="202">Springs the White-man 's Foot in blossom .</l>
       <l n="203">“ Let us welcome , then , the strangers ,</l>
       <l n="204">Hail them as our friends and brothers ,</l>
       <l n="205">And the heart 's right hand of friendship</l>
       <l n="206">Give them when they come to see us .</l>
       <l n="207">Gitche Manito , the Mighty ,</l>
       <l n="208">Said this to me in my vision .</l>
       <l n="209">“ I beheld , too , in that vision</l>
       <l n="210">All the secrets of the future ,</l>
       <l n="211">Of the distant days that shall be .</l>
       <l n="212">I beheld the westward marches</l>
       <l n="213">Of the unknown , crowded nations .</l>
       <l n="214">All the land was full of people ,</l>
       <l n="215">Restless , struggling , toiling , striving ,</l>
       <l n="216">Speaking many tongues , yet feeling</l>
       <l n="217">But one heart-beat in their bosoms .</l>
       <l n="218">In the woodlands rang their axes ,</l>
       <l n="219">Smoked their towns in all the valleys ,</l>
       <l n="220">Over all the lakes and rivers</l>
       <l n="221">Rushed their great canoes of thunder .</l>
       <l n="222">“ Then a darker , drearier vision</l>
       <l n="223">Passed before me , vague and cloud-like ;</l>
       <l n="224">I beheld our nation scattered ,</l>
       <l n="225">All forgetful of my counsels ,</l>
       <l n="226">Weakened , warring with each other ;</l>
       <l n="227">Saw the remnants of our people</l>
       <l n="228">Sweeping westward , wild and woful ,</l>
       <l n="229">Like the cloud-rack of a tempest ,</l>
       <l n="230">Like the withered leaves of Autumn ! ”</l>

      <head>HIAWATHA 'S DEPARTURE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">By the shore of Gitche Gumee ,</l>
       <l n="2">By the shining Big-Sea-Water ,</l>
       <l n="3">At the doorway of his wigwam ,</l>
       <l n="4">In the pleasant Summer morning ,</l>
       <l n="5">Hiawatha stood and waited .</l>
       <l n="6">All the air was full of freshness ,</l>
       <l n="7">All the earth was bright and joyous ,</l>
       <l n="8">And before him , through the sunshine ,</l>
       <l n="9">Westward toward the neighboring forest</l>
       <l n="10">Passed in golden swarms the Ahmo ,</l>
       <l n="11">Passed the bees , the honey-makers ,</l>
       <l n="12">Burning , singing in the sunshine .</l>
       <l n="13">Bright above him shone the heavens ,</l>
       <l n="14">Level spread the lake before him ;</l>
       <l n="15">From its bosom leaped the sturgeon ,</l>
       <l n="16">Sparkling , flashing in the sunshine ;</l>
       <l n="17">On its margin the great forest</l>
       <l n="18">Stood reflected in the water ,</l>
       <l n="19">Every tree-top had its shadow ,</l>
       <l n="20">Motionless beneath the water .</l>
       <l n="21">From the brow of Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="22">Gone was every trace of sorrow ,</l>
       <l n="23">As the fog from off the water ,</l>
       <l n="24">As the mist from off the meadow .</l>
       <l n="25">With a smile of joy and triumph ,</l>
       <l n="26">With a look of exultation ,</l>
       <l n="27">As of one who in a vision</l>
       <l n="28">Sees what is to be , but is not ,</l>
       <l n="29">Stood and waited Hiawatha .</l>
       <l n="30">Toward the sun his hands were lifted ,</l>
       <l n="31">Both the palms spread out against it ,</l>
       <l n="32">And between the parted fingers</l>
       <l n="33">Fell the sunshine on his features ,</l>
       <l n="34">Flecked with light his naked shoulders ,</l>
       <l n="35">As it falls and flecks an oak-tree</l>
       <l n="36">Through the rifted leaves and branches .</l>
       <l n="37">O'er the water floating , flying ,</l>
       <l n="38">Something in the hazy distance ,</l>
       <l n="39">Something in the mists of morning ,</l>
       <l n="40">Loomed and lifted from the water ,</l>
       <l n="41">Now seemed floating , now seemed flying ,</l>
       <l n="42">Coming nearer , nearer , nearer .</l>
       <l n="43">Was it Shingebis the diver ?</l>
       <l n="44">Or the pelican , the Shada ?</l>
       <l n="45">Or the heron , the Shuh-shuh-gah ?</l>
       <l n="46">Or the white goose , Waw-be-wawa ,</l>
       <l n="47">With the water dripping , flashing ,</l>
       <l n="48">From its glossy neck and feathers ?</l>
       <l n="49">It was neither goose nor diver ,</l>
       <l n="50">Neither pelican nor heron ,</l>
       <l n="51">O'er the water floating , flying ,</l>
       <l n="52">Through the shining mist of morning ,</l>
       <l n="53">But a birch canoe with paddles ,</l>
       <l n="54">Rising , sinking on the water ,</l>
       <l n="55">Dripping , flashing in the sunshine ;</l>
       <l n="56">And within it came a people</l>
       <l n="57">From the distant land of Wabun ,</l>
       <l n="58">From the farthest realms of morning</l>
       <l n="59">Came the Black-Robe chief , the Prophet ,</l>
       <l n="60">He the Priest of Prayer , the Pale-face ,</l>
       <l n="61">With his guides and his companions .</l>
       <l n="62">And the noble Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="63">With his hands aloft extended ,</l>
       <l n="64">Held aloft in sign of welcome ,</l>
       <l n="65">Waited , full of exultation ,</l>
       <l n="66">Till the birch canoe with paddles</l>
       <l n="67">Grated on the shining pebbles ,</l>
       <l n="68">Stranded on the sandy margin ,</l>
       <l n="69">Till the Black-Robe chief , the Pale-face ,</l>
       <l n="70">With the cross upon his bosom ,</l>
       <l n="71">Landed on the sandy margin .</l>
       <l n="72">Then the joyous Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="73">Cried aloud and spake in this wise :</l>
       <l n="74">“ Beautiful is the sun , O strangers ,</l>
       <l n="75">When you come so far to see us !</l>
       <l n="76">All our town in peace awaits you ,</l>
       <l n="77">All our doors stand open for you ;</l>
       <l n="78">You shall enter all our wigwams ,</l>
       <l n="79">For the heart 's right hand we give you .</l>
       <l n="80">“ Never bloomed the earth so gayly ,</l>
       <l n="81">Never shone the sun so brightly ,</l>
       <l n="82">As to-day they shine and blossom</l>
       <l n="83">When you come so far to see us !</l>
       <l n="84">Never was our lake so tranquil ,</l>
       <l n="85">Nor so free from rocks , and sand-bars ;</l>
       <l n="86">For your birch canoe in passing</l>
       <l n="87">Has removed both rock and sand-bar .</l>
       <l n="88">“ Never before had our tobacco</l>
       <l n="89">Such a sweet and pleasant flavor ,</l>
       <l n="90">Never the broad leaves of our cornfields</l>
       <l n="91">Were so beautiful to look on ,</l>
       <l n="92">As they seem to us this morning ,</l>
       <l n="93">When you come so far to see us ! ’</l>
       <l n="94">And the Black-Robe chief made answer ,</l>
       <l n="95">Stammered in his speech a little ,</l>
       <l n="96">Speaking words yet unfamiliar :</l>
       <l n="97">“ Peace be with you , Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="98">Peace be with you and your people ,</l>
       <l n="99">Peace of prayer , and peace of pardon ,</l>
       <l n="100">Peace of Christ , and joy of Mary ! ”</l>
       <l n="101">Then the generous Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="102">Led the strangers to his wigwam ,</l>
       <l n="103">Seated them on skins of bison ,</l>
       <l n="104">Seated them on skins of ermine ,</l>
       <l n="105">And the careful old Nokomis</l>
       <l n="106">Brought them food in bowls of basswood ,</l>
       <l n="107">Water brought in birchen dippers ,</l>
       <l n="108">And the calumet , the peace-pipe ,</l>
       <l n="109">Filled and lighted for their smoking .</l>
       <l n="110">All the old men of the village ,</l>
       <l n="111">All the warriors of the nation ,</l>
       <l n="112">All the Jossakeeds , the Prophets ,</l>
       <l n="113">The magicians , the Wabenos ,</l>
       <l n="114">And the Medicine-men , the Medas ,</l>
       <l n="115">Came to bid the strangers welcome ;</l>
       <l n="116">“ It is well ” , they said , “ O brothers ,</l>
       <l n="117">That you come so far to see us ! ”</l>
       <l n="118">In a circle round the doorway ,</l>
       <l n="119">With their pipes they sat in silence ,</l>
       <l n="120">Waiting to behold the strangers ,</l>
       <l n="121">Waiting to receive their message ;</l>
       <l n="122">Till the Black-Robe chief , the Pale-face ,</l>
       <l n="123">From the wigwam came to greet them ,</l>
       <l n="124">Stammering in his speech a little ,</l>
       <l n="125">Speaking words yet unfamiliar ;</l>
       <l n="126">“ It is well , ” they said , “ O brother ,</l>
       <l n="127">That you come so far to see us ! ”</l>
       <l n="128">Then the Black-Robe chief , the Prophet ,</l>
       <l n="129">Told his message to the people ,</l>
       <l n="130">Told the purport of his mission ,</l>
       <l n="131">Told them of the Virgin Mary ,</l>
       <l n="132">And her blessed Son , the Saviour ,</l>
       <l n="133">How in distant lands and ages</l>
       <l n="134">He had lived on earth as we do ;</l>
       <l n="135">How he fasted , prayed , and labored ;</l>
       <l n="136">How the Jews , the tribe accursed ,</l>
       <l n="137">Mocked him , scourged him , crucified him ;</l>
       <l n="138">How he rose from where they laid him ,</l>
       <l n="139">Walked again with his disciples ,</l>
       <l n="140">And ascended into heaven .</l>
       <l n="141">And the chiefs made answer , saying :</l>
       <l n="142">“ We have listened to your message ,</l>
       <l n="143">We have heard your words of wisdom ,</l>
       <l n="144">We will think on what you tell us .</l>
       <l n="145">It is well for us , O brothers ,</l>
       <l n="146">That you come so far to see us ! ”</l>
       <l n="147">Then they rose up and departed</l>
       <l n="148">Each one homeward to his wigwam ,</l>
       <l n="149">To the young men and the women</l>
       <l n="150">Told the story of the strangers</l>
       <l n="151">Whom the Master of Life had sent them</l>
       <l n="152">From the shining land of Wabun .</l>
       <l n="153">Heavy with the heat and silence</l>
       <l n="154">Grew the afternoon of Summer ;</l>
       <l n="155">With a drowsy sound the forest</l>
       <l n="156">Whispered round the sultry wigwam ,</l>
       <l n="157">With a sound of sleep the water</l>
       <l n="158">Rippled on the beach below it ;</l>
       <l n="159">From the cornfields shrill and ceaseless</l>
       <l n="160">Sang the grasshopper , Pah-puk-keena ;</l>
       <l n="161">And the guests of Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="162">Weary with the heat of Summer ,</l>
       <l n="163">Slumbered in the sultry wigwam .</l>
       <l n="164">Slowly o'er the simmering landscape</l>
       <l n="165">Fell the evening 's dusk and coolness ,</l>
       <l n="166">And the long and level sunbeams</l>
       <l n="167">Shot their spears into the forest ,</l>
       <l n="168">Breaking through its shields of shadow ,</l>
       <l n="169">Rushed into each secret ambush ,</l>
       <l n="170">Searched each thicket , dingle , hollow ;</l>
       <l n="171">Still the guests of Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="172">Slumbered in the silent wigwam .</l>
       <l n="173">From his place rose Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="174">Bade farewell to old Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="175">Spake in whispers , spake in this wise ,</l>
       <l n="176">Did not wake the guests , that slumbered .</l>
       <l n="177">“ I am going , O Nokomis ,</l>
       <l n="178">On a long and distant journey ,</l>
       <l n="179">To the portals of the Sunset .</l>
       <l n="180">To the regions of the home-wind ,</l>
       <l n="181">Of the Northwest-Wind , Keewaydin .</l>
       <l n="182">But these guests I leave behind me ,</l>
       <l n="183">In your watch and ward I leave them ;</l>
       <l n="184">See that never harm comes near them ,</l>
       <l n="185">See that never fear molests them ,</l>
       <l n="186">Never danger nor suspicion ,</l>
       <l n="187">Never want of food or shelter ,</l>
       <l n="188">In the lodge of Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="189">Forth into the village went he ,</l>
       <l n="190">Bade farewell to all the warriors ,</l>
       <l n="191">Bade farewell to all the young men ,</l>
       <l n="192">Spake persuading , spake in this wise :</l>
       <l n="193">“ I am going , O my people ,</l>
       <l n="194">On a long and distant journey ;</l>
       <l n="195">Many moons and many winters</l>
       <l n="196">Will have come , and will have vanished ,</l>
       <l n="197">Ere I come again to see you .</l>
       <l n="198">But my guests I leave behind me ;</l>
       <l n="199">Listen to their words of wisdom ,</l>
       <l n="200">Listen to the truth they tell you ,</l>
       <l n="201">For the Master of Life has sent them</l>
       <l n="202">From the land of light and morning ! ”</l>
       <l n="203">On the shore stood Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="204">Turned and waved his hand at parting ;</l>
       <l n="205">On the clear and luminous water</l>
       <l n="206">Launched his birch canoe for sailing ,</l>
       <l n="207">From the pebbles of the margin</l>
       <l n="208">Shoved it forth into the water ;</l>
       <l n="209">Whispered to it , “ Westward ! westward ! ”</l>
       <l n="210">And with speed it darted forward .</l>
       <l n="211">And the evening sun descending</l>
       <l n="212">Set the clouds on fire with redness ,</l>
       <l n="213">Burned the broad sky , like a prairie ,</l>
       <l n="214">Left upon the level water</l>
       <l n="215">One long track and trail of splendor ,</l>
       <l n="216">Down whose stream , as down a river ,</l>
       <l n="217">Westward , westward Hiawatha</l>
       <l n="218">Sailed into the fiery sunset ,</l>
       <l n="219">Sailed into the purple vapors ,</l>
       <l n="220">Sailed into the dusk of evening :</l>
       <l n="221">And the people from the margin</l>
       <l n="222">Watched him floating , rising , sinking ,</l>
       <l n="223">Till the birch canoe seemed lifted</l>
       <l n="224">High into that sea of splendor ,</l>
       <l n="225">Till it sank into the vapors</l>
       <l n="226">Like the new moon slowly , slowly</l>
       <l n="227">Sinking in the purple distance .</l>
       <l n="228">And they said , “ Farewell forever ! ”</l>
       <l n="229">Said , “ Farewell , O Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="230">And the forests , dark and lonely ,</l>
       <l n="231">Moved through all their depths of darkness ,</l>
       <l n="232">Sighed , “ Farewell , O Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="233">And the waves upon the margin</l>
       <l n="234">Rising , rippling on the pebbles ,</l>
       <l n="235">Sobbed , “ Farewell , O Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="236">And the heron , the Shuh-shuh-gah ,</l>
       <l n="237">From her haunts among the fen-lands ,</l>
       <l n="238">Screamed , “ Farewell , O Hiawatha ! ”</l>
       <l n="239">Thus departed Hiawatha ,</l>
       <l n="240">Hiawatha the Beloved ,</l>
       <l n="241">In the glory of the sunset ,.</l>
       <l n="242">In the purple mists of evening ,</l>

       <l n="249">THE SONG OF HIAWATHA .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>This Indian Edda — if I may so call it — is founded on a tradition prevalent among the North American Indians , of a personage of miraculous birth , who was sent among them to clear their rivers , forests , and fishing-grounds , and to teach them the arts of peace .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">He was known among different tribes by the several names of</l>
       <l n="2">Michabou , Chiabo , Manabozo , Tarenyawagon , and Hiawatha . Mr .</l>
       <l n="3">Schoolcraft gives an account of him in his Algic Researches , Vol . I .</l>
       <l n="4">p. 134 ; and in his History , Condition , and Prospects of the Indian</l>
       <l n="5">Tribes of the United States , Part III . p. 314 , may be found the</l>
       <l n="6">Iroquois form of the tradition , derived from the verbal narrations</l>
       <l n="7">of an Onondaga chief .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Into this old tradition I have woven other curious Indian legends , drawn chiefly from the various and valuable writings of Mr. Schoolcraft , to whom the literary world is greatly indebted for his indefatigable zeal in rescuing from oblivion so much of the legendary lore of the Indians .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">The scene of the poem is among the Ojibways on the southern shore of</l>
       <l n="2">Lake Superior , in the region between the Pictured Rocks and the</l>

     <p>Condition of the North American Indians , Vol . II p. 160 , gives an interesting account of the Coteau des Prairies , and the Red Pipestone Quarry . He says :—</p>
     <p>“ Here ( according to their traditions ) happened the mysterious birth of the red pipe , which has blown its fumes of peace and war to the remotest corners of the continent ; which has visited every warrior , and passed through its reddened stem the irrevocable oath of war and desolation . And here , also , the peace-breathing calumet was born , and fringed with the eagle 's quills , which has shed its thrilling fumes over the land , and soothed the fury of the relentless savage .</p>
     <p>“ The Great Spirit at an ancient period here called the Indian nations together , and , standing on the precipice of the red pipe - stone rock , broke from its wall a piece , and made a huge pipe by turning it in his hand , which he smoked over them , and to the North , the South , the East , and the West , and told them that this stone was red ,— that it was their flesh ,— that they must use it for their pipes of peace ,— that it belonged to them all , and that the war-club and scalping-knife must not be raised on its ground . At the last whiff of his pipe his head went into a great cloud , and the whole surface of the rock for several miles was melted and glazed ; two great ovens were opened beneath , and two women ( guardian spirits of the place ) entered them in a blaze of fire ; and they are heard there yet ( Tso-mec-cos-tee aud Tso-me-cos-te-won-dee ) , answering to the invocations of the high-priests or medicine-men , who consult them when they are visitors to this sacred place . ”</p>
     <p>Hark you , Bear ! you are a coward .</p>
     <p>This anecdote is from Heckewelder . In his account of the Indian Nations , he describes an Indian hunter as addressing a bear in nearly these words . “ I was present , ” he says , “ at the delivery of this curious invective ; when the hunter had despatched the bear , I asked him how he thought that poor animal could understand what he said to it . ‘ O , ’ said he in answer , ‘ the bear understood me very well ; did you not observe how ashamed he looked while I was upbraiding him ? " ’ — Transactions of the American Philosophical Society , Vol . I. p. 240 .</p>
     <p>Hush ! the Naked Bear will hear thee !</p>
     <p>Heckewelder , in a letter published in the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society , Vol . IV . p. 260 , speaks of this tradition as prevalent among the Mohicans and Delawares .</p>
     <p>“ Their reports , ” he says , “ run thus : that among all animals that had been formerly in this country , this was the most ferocious ; that it was much larger than the largest of the common bears , and remarkably long-bodied ; all over ( except a spot of hair on its back of a white color ) naked . . . . .</p>
     <p>“ The history of this animal used to be a subject of conversation among the Indians , especially when in the woods a hunting . I have also heard them say to their children when crying : ‘ Hush ! the naked bear will hear you , be upon you , and devour you , ’ ”</p>

     <p>“ The Grand Sable possesses a scenic interest little inferior to that of the Pictured Rocks . The explorer passes abruptly from a coast of consolidated sand to one of loose materials ; and although in the one case the cliffs are less precipitous , yet in the other they attain a higher altitude . He sees before him a long reach of coast , resembling a vast sand-bank , more than three hundred and fifty feet in height , without a trace of vegetation . Ascending to the top , rounded hillocks of blown sand are observed , with occasional clumps of trees standing out like oases in the desert . ”</p>

     <p>The fanciful tradition of the Red Swan may be found in Schoolcraft 's Algic Researches , Vol . II . p. 9 . Three brothers were hunting on a wager to see who would bring home the first game .</p>
     <p>“ They were to shoot no other animal , ” so the legend says , “ but such as each was in the habit of killing . They set out different ways : Odjibwa , the youngest , had not gone far before he saw a bear , an animal he was not to kill , by the agreement . He followed him close , and drove an arrow through him , which brought him to the ground . Although contrary to the bet , he immediately commenced skinning him , when suddenly something red tinged all the air around him . He rubbed his eyes , thinking he was perhaps deceived ; but without effect , for the red hue continued . At length he heard a strange noise at a distance . It first appeared like a human voice , but after following the sound for some distance , he reached the shores of a lake , and soon saw the object he was looking for . At a distance out in the lake sat a most beautiful Red Swan , whose plumage glittered in the sun , and who would now and then make the same noise he had heard . He was within long bow-shot , and , pulling the arrow from the bowstring up to his ear , took deliberate aim and shot . The arrow took no effect ; and he shot and shot again till his quiver was empty . Still the swan remained , moving round and round , stretching its long neck and dipping its bill into the water , as if heedless of the arrows shot at it . Odjibwa ran home , and got all his own and his brother 's arrows and shot them all away . He then stood and gazed at the beautiful bird . While standing , he remembered his brother 's saying that in their deceased father 's medicine-sack were three magic arrows . Off he started , his anxiety to kill the swan overcoming all scruples . At any other time , he would have deemed it sacrilege to open his father 's medicine-sack ; but now he hastily seized the three arrows and ran back , leaving the other contents of the sack scattered over the lodge . The swan was still there . He shot the first arrow with great precision , and came very near to it . The second came still closer ; as he took the last arrow , he felt his arm firmer , and , drawing it up with vigor , saw it pass through the neck of the swan a little above the breast . Still it did not prevent the bird from flying off , which it did , however , at first slowly , flapping its wings and rising gradually into the airs and teen flying off toward the sinking of the sun . ” — pp. 10-12 .</p>

       <l n="1">Sing the mysteries of Mondamin .</l>
       <l n="2">The Indians hold the maize , or Indian corn , in great veneration .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ They esteem it so important and divine a grain , ” says Schoolcraft , “ that their story-tellers invented various tales , in which this idea is symbolized under the form of a special gift from the Great Spirit . The Odjibwa-Algonquins , who call it Mon-da-min , that is , the Spirit 's grain or berry , have a pretty story of this kind , in which the stalk in full tassel is represented as descending from the sky , under the guise of a handsome youth , in answer to the prayers of a young man at his fast of virility , or coming to manhood .</p>
     <p>“ It is well known that corn-planting and corn-gathering , at least among all the still uncolonized tribes , are left entirely to the females and children , and a few superannuated old men . It is not generally known , perhaps , that this labor is not compulsory , and that it is assumed by the females as a just equivalent , in their view , for the onerous and continuous labor of the other sex , in providing meats , and skins for clothing , by the chase , and in defending their villages against their enemies , and keeping intruders off their territories . A good Indian housewife deems this a part of her prerogative , and prides herself to have a store of corn to exercise her hospitality , or duly honor her husband 's hospitality , in the entertainment of the lodge guests . ” — Oneota , p. 82 .</p>
     <p>Thus the fields shall be more fruitful .</p>
     <p>“ A singular proof of this belief , in both sexes , of the mysterious influence of the steps of a woman on the vegetable and in sect creation , is found in an ancient custom , which was related to me , respecting corn-planting . It was the practice of the hunter 's wife , when the field of corn had been planted , to choose the first dark or overclouded evening to perform a secret circuit , sans habillement , around the field . For this purpose she slipped out of the lodge in the evening , unobserved , to some obscure nook , where she completely disrobed . Then , taking her matchecota , or principal garment , in one hand , she dragged it around the field . This was thought to insure a prolific crop , and to prevent the assaults of insects and worms upon the grain . It was supposed they could not creep over the charmed line . ” — Oneota , p. 83 .</p>
     <p>With his prisoner-string he bound him .</p>
     <p>“ These cords , ” says Mr. Tanner “ are made of the bark of the elm - tree , by boiling and then immersing it in cold water . . . . The leader of a war party commonly carries several fastened about his waist , and if , in the course of the fight , any one of his young men take a prisoner , it is his duty to bring him immediately to the chief , to be tied , and the latter is responsible for his safe keeping . ” — Narrative of Captivity and Adventures , p. 412 .</p>

       <l n="1">Wagemin , the thief of cornfields ,</l>
       <l n="2">Paimosaid , who steals the maize-ear .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ If one of the young female huskers finds a red ear of corn , it is typical of a brave admirer , and is regarded as a fitting present to some young warrior . But if the ear be crooked , and tapering to a point , no matter what color , the whole circle is set in a roar , and wa-ge-min is the word shouted aloud . It is the symbol of a thief in the cornfield . It is considered as the image of an old man stooping as he enters the lot . Had the chisel of Praxiteles been employed to produce this image , it could not more vividly bring to the minds of the merry group the idea of a pilferer of their favorite mondamin . . . .</p>
     <p>“ The literal meaning of the term is , a mass , or crooked ear of grain ; but the ear of corn so called is a conventional type of a little old man pilfering ears of corn in a cornfield . It is in this manner that a single word or term , in these curious languages , becomes the fruitful parent of many ideas . And we can thus perceive why it is that the word wagemin is alone competent to excite merriment in the husking circle .</p>
     <p>“ This term is taken as the basis of the cereal chorus , or corn song , as sung by the Northern Algonquin tribes . It is coupled with the phrase Paimosaid ,— a permutative form of the Indian substantive , made from the verb pim-o-sa , to walk . Its literal meaning is , he who walks , or the walker ; but the ideas conveyed by it are , he who walks by night to pilfer corn . It offers , therefore , a kind of parallelism in expression to the preceding term . ” — Oneota , p. 254 .</p>
     <p>Pugasaing , with thirteen pieces .</p>
     <p>This Game of the Bowl is the principal game of hazard among the Northern tribes of Indians . Mr. Schoolcraft gives a particular account of it in Oneota , p. 85 . “ This game , ” he says , “ is very fascinating to some portions of the Indians . They stake at it their ornaments , weapons , clothing , canoes , horses , everything in fact they possess ; and have been known , it is said , to set up their wives and children and even to forfeit their own liberty . Of such desperate stakes I have seen no examples , nor do I think the game itself in common use . It is rather confined to certain persons , who hold the relative rank of gamblers in Indian society ,— men who are not noted as hunters or warriors , or steady providers for their families . Among these are persons who bear the term of Iena-dizze - wug , that is , wanderers about the country , braggadocios , or fops . It can hardly be classed with the popular games of amusement , by which skill and dexterity are acquired . I have generally found the chiefs and graver men of the tribes , who encouraged the young men to play ball , and are sure to be present at the customary sports , to witness , and sanction , and applaud them , speak lightly and disparagingly of this game of hazard . Yet it cannot be denied that some of the chiefs , distinguished in war and the chase , at the West , can be referred to as lending their example to its fascinating power . ”</p>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ The Pictured Rocks may be described , in general terms , as a series of sandstone bluffs extending along the shore of Lake Superior for about five miles , and rising , in most places , vertically from the water , without any beach at the base , to a height varying from fifty to nearly two hundred feet . Were they simply a line of cliffs , they might not , so far as relates to height or extent , be worthy of a rank among great natural curiosities , although such an assemblage of rocky strata , washed by the waves of the great lake , would not , under any circumstances , be destitute of grandeur . To the voyager , coasting along their base in his frail canoe , they would , at all times , be an object of dread ; the recoil of the surf , the rock-bound coast , affording , for miles , no place of refuge ,— the lowering sky , the rising wind ,— all these would excite his apprehension , and induce him to ply a vigorous oar until the dreaded wall was passed . But in the Pictured Rocks there are two features which communicate to the scenery a wonderful and almost unique character . These are , first , the curious manner in which the cliffs have been excavated and worn away by the action of the lake , which , for centuries , has dashed an ocean-like surf against their base ; and , second , the equally curious manner in which large portions of the surface have been colored by bands of brilliant hues .</p>
     <p>“ It is from the latter circumstance that the name , by which these cliffs are known to the American traveller , is derived ; while that applied to them by the French voyageurs ( ‘ Les Portails ’ ) is derived from the former , and by far the most striking peculiarity .</p>
     <p>“ The term Pictured Rocks has been in use for a great length of time ; but when it was first applied , we have been unable to discover . It would seem that the first travellers were more impressed with the novel and striking distribution of colors on the surface than with the astonishing variety of form into which the cliffs themselves have been worn . . . .</p>
     <p>“ Our voyageurs had many legends to relate of the pranks of the Menni-bojou in these caverns , and , in answer to our inquiries , seemed disposed to fabricate stories , without end , of the achievements of this Indian deity . ”</p>
     <p>Toward the Sun his hands were lifted .</p>
     <p>In this manner , and with such salutations , was Father Marquette received by the Illinois . See his Voyages et Decouvertes , Section V .</p>

      <head>THE COURTSHIP OF MILES STANDISH</head>
       <head>I</head>
      <head>MILES STANDISH</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">In the Old Colony days , in Plymouth the land of the Pilgrims ,</l>
       <l n="2">To and fro in a room of his simple and primitive dwelling ,</l>
       <l n="3">Clad in doublet and hose , and boots of Cordovan leather ,</l>
       <l n="4">Strode , with a martial air , Miles Standish the Puritan Captain .</l>
       <l n="5">Buried in thought he seemed , with his hands behind him , and pausing</l>
       <l n="6">Ever and anon to behold his glittering weapons of warfare ,</l>
       <l n="7">Hanging in shining array along the walls of the chamber ,—</l>
       <l n="8">Cutlass and corselet of steel , and his trusty sword of Damascus ,</l>
       <l n="9">Curved at the point and inscribed with its mystical Arabic sentence ,</l>
       <l n="10">While underneath , in a corner , were fowling-piece , musket , and matchlock .</l>
       <l n="11">Short of stature he was , but strongly built and athletic ,</l>
       <l n="12">Broad in the shoulders , deep-chested , with muscles and sinews of iron ;</l>
       <l n="13">Brown as a nut was his face , but his russet beard was already</l>
       <l n="14">Flaked with patches of snow , as hedges sometimes in November .</l>
       <l n="15">Near him was seated John Alden , his friend , and household companion ,</l>
       <l n="16">Writing with diligent speed at a table of pine by the window ;</l>
       <l n="17">Fair-haired , azure-eyed , with delicate Saxon complexion ,</l>
       <l n="18">Having the dew of his youth , and the beauty thereof , as the captives</l>
       <l n="19">Whom Saint Gregory saw , and exclaimed , “ Not Angles , but Angels . ”</l>
       <l n="20">Youngest of all was he of the men who came in the Mayflower .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="21">Suddenly breaking the silence , the diligent scribe interrupting ,</l>
       <l n="22">Spake , in the pride of his heart , Miles Standish the Captain of Plymouth .</l>
       <l n="23">“ Look at these arms , ” he said , “ the warlike weapons that hang here</l>
       <l n="24">Burnished and bright and clean , as if for parade or inspection !</l>
       <l n="25">This is the sword of Damascus I fought with in Flanders ; this breastplate ,</l>
       <l n="26">Well I remember the day ! once saved my life in a skirmish ;</l>
       <l n="27">Here in front you can see the very dint of the bullet</l>
       <l n="28">Fired point-blank at my heart by a Spanish arcabucero .</l>
       <l n="29">Had it not been of sheer steel , the forgotten bones of Miles Standish</l>
       <l n="30">Would at this moment be mould , in their grave in the Flemish morasses . ”</l>
       <l n="31">Thereupon answered John Alden , but looked not up from his writing :</l>
       <l n="32">“ Truly the breath of the Lord hath slackened the speed of the bullet ;</l>
       <l n="33">He in his mercy preserved you , to be our shield and our weapon ! ”</l>
       <l n="34">Still the Captain continued , unheeding the words of the stripling :</l>
       <l n="35">“ See , how bright they are burnished , as if in an arsenal hanging ;</l>
       <l n="36">That is because I have done it myself , and not left it to others .</l>
       <l n="37">Serve yourself , would you be well served , is an excellent adage ;</l>
       <l n="38">So I take care of my arms , as you of your pens and your inkhorn .</l>
       <l n="39">Then , too , there are my soldiers , my great , invincible army ,</l>
       <l n="40">Twelve men , all equipped , having each his rest and his matchlock ,</l>
       <l n="41">Eighteen shillings a month , together with diet and pillage ,</l>
       <l n="42">And , like Caesar , I know the name of each of my soldiers ! ”</l>
       <l n="43">This he said with a smile , that danced in his eyes , as the sunbeams</l>
       <l n="44">Dance on the waves of the sea , and vanish again in a moment .</l>
       <l n="45">Alden laughed as he wrote , and still the Captain continued :</l>
       <l n="46">“ Look ! you can see from this window my brazen howitzer planted</l>
       <l n="47">High on the roof of the church , a preacher who speaks to the purpose ,</l>
       <l n="48">Steady , straight-forward , and strong , with irresistible logic ,</l>
       <l n="49">Orthodox , flashing conviction right into the hearts of the heathen .</l>
       <l n="50">Now we are ready , I think , for any assault of the Indians ;</l>
       <l n="51">Let them come , if they like , and the sooner they try it the better ,—</l>
       <l n="52">Let them come if they like , be it sagamore , sachem , or pow-wow ,</l>
       <l n="53">Aspinet , Samoset , Corbitant , Squanto , or Tokamahamon ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="54">Long at the window he stood , and wistfully gazed on the landscape ,</l>
       <l n="55">Washed with a cold gray mist , the vapory breath of the east-wind ,</l>
       <l n="56">Forest and meadow and hill , and the steel-blue rim of the ocean ,</l>
       <l n="57">Lying silent and sad , in the afternoon shadows and sunshine .</l>
       <l n="58">Over his countenance flitted a shadow like those on the landscape ,</l>
       <l n="59">Gloom intermingled with light ; and his voice was subdued with emotion ,</l>
       <l n="60">Tenderness , pity , regret , as after a pause he proceeded :</l>
       <l n="61">“ Yonder there , on the hill by the sea , lies buried Rose Standish ;</l>
       <l n="62">Beautiful rose of love , that bloomed for me by the wayside !</l>
       <l n="63">She was the first to die of all who came in the Mayflower !</l>
       <l n="64">Green above her is growing the field of wheat we have sown there ,</l>
       <l n="65">Better to hide from the Indian scouts the graves of our people ,</l>
       <l n="66">Lest they should count them and see how many already have perished ! ”</l>
       <l n="67">Sadly his face he averted , and strode up and down , and was thoughtful .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="68">Fixed to the opposite wall was a shelf of books , and among them</l>
       <l n="69">Prominent three , distinguished alike for bulk and for binding ;</l>
       <l n="70">Bariffe 's Artillery Guide , and the Commentaries of Caesar ,</l>
       <l n="71">Out of the Latin translated by Arthur Goldinge of London ,</l>
       <l n="72">And , as if guarded by these , between them was standing the Bible .</l>
       <l n="73">Musing a moment before them , Miles Standish paused , as if doubtful</l>
       <l n="74">Which of the three he should choose for his consolation and comfort ,</l>
       <l n="75">Whether the wars of the Hebrews , the famous campaigns of the Romans ,</l>
       <l n="76">Or the Artillery practice , designed for belligerent Christians .</l>
       <l n="77">Finally down from its shelf he dragged the ponderous Roman ,</l>
       <l n="78">Seated himself at the window , and opened the book , and in silence</l>
       <l n="79">Turned o'er the well-worn leaves , where thumb-marks thick on the margin ,</l>
       <l n="80">Like the trample of feet , proclaimed the battle was hottest .</l>
       <l n="81">Nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling ,</l>
       <l n="82">Busily writing epistles important , to go by the Mayflower ,</l>
       <l n="83">Ready to sail on the morrow , or next day at latest , God willing !</l>
       <l n="84">Homeward bound with the tidings of all that terrible winter ,</l>
       <l n="85">Letters written by Alden , and full of the name of Priscilla ,</l>
       <l n="86">Full of the name and the fame of the Puritan maiden Priscilla !</l>

      <head>LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling ,</l>
       <l n="2">Or an occasional sigh from the laboring heart of the Captain ,</l>
       <l n="3">Reading the marvellous words and achievements of Julius Caesar .</l>
       <l n="4">After a while he exclaimed , as he smote with his hand , palm downwards ,</l>
       <l n="5">Heavily on the page : “ A wonderful man was this Caesar !</l>
       <l n="6">You are a writer , and I am a fighter , but here is a fellow</l>
       <l n="7">Who could both write and fight , and in both was equally skilful ! ”</l>
       <l n="8">Straightway answered and spake John Alden , the comely , the youthful :</l>
       <l n="9">“ Yes , he was equally skilled , as you say , with his pen and his weapons .</l>
       <l n="10">Somewhere have I read , but where I forget , he could dictate</l>
       <l n="11">Seven letters at once , at the same time writing his memoirs . ”</l>
       <l n="12">“ Truly , ” continued the Captain , not heeding or hearing the other ,</l>
       <l n="13">“ Truly a wonderful man was Caius Julius Caesar !</l>
       <l n="14">Better be first , he said , in a little Iberian village ,</l>
       <l n="15">Than be second in Rome , and I think he was right when he said it .</l>
       <l n="16">Twice was he married before he was twenty , and many times after ;</l>
       <l n="17">Battles five hundred he fought , and a thousand cities he conquered ;</l>
       <l n="18">He , too , fought in Flanders , as he himself has recorded ;</l>
       <l n="19">Finally he was stabbed by his friend , the orator Brutus !</l>
       <l n="20">Now , do you know what he did on a certain occasion in Flanders ,</l>
       <l n="21">When the rear-guard of his army retreated , the front giving way too ,</l>
       <l n="22">And the immortal Twelfth Legion was crowded so closely together</l>
       <l n="23">There was no room for their swords ? Why , he seized a shield from a soldier ,</l>
       <l n="24">Put himself straight at the head of his troops , and commanded the captains ,</l>
       <l n="25">Calling on each by his name , to order forward the ensigns ;</l>
       <l n="26">Then to widen the ranks , and give more room for their weapons ;</l>
       <l n="27">So he won the day , the battle of something-or-other .</l>
       <l n="28">That 's what I always say ; if you wish a thing to be well done ,</l>
       <l n="29">You must do it yourself , you must not leave it to others ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="30">All was silent again ; the Captain continued his reading .</l>
       <l n="31">Nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling</l>
       <l n="32">Writing epistles important to go next day by the Mayflower ,</l>
       <l n="33">Filled with the name and the fame of the Puritan maiden Priscilla ;</l>
       <l n="34">Every sentence began or closed with the name of Priscilla ,</l>
       <l n="35">Till the treacherous pen , to which he confided the secret ,</l>
       <l n="36">Strove to betray it by singing and shouting the name of Priscilla !</l>
       <l n="37">Finally closing his book , with a bang of the ponderous cover ,</l>
       <l n="38">Sudden and loud as the sound of a soldier grounding his musket ,</l>
       <l n="39">Thus to the young man spake Miles Standish the Captain of Plymouth :</l>
       <l n="40">“ When you have finished your work , I have something important to tell you .</l>
       <l n="41">Be not however in haste ; I can wait ; I shall not be impatient ! ”</l>
       <l n="42">Straightway Alden replied , as he folded the last of his letters ,</l>
       <l n="43">Pushing his papers aside , and giving respectful attention :</l>
       <l n="44">“ Speak ; for whenever you speak , I am always ready to listen ,</l>
       <l n="45">Always ready to hear whatever pertains to Miles Standish . ”</l>
       <l n="46">Thereupon answered the Captain , embarrassed , and culling his phrases :</l>
       <l n="47">“ ‘ T is not good for a man to be alone , say the Scriptures .</l>
       <l n="48">This I have said before , and again and again I repeat it ;</l>
       <l n="49">Every hour in the day , I think it , and feel it , and say it .</l>
       <l n="50">Since Rose Standish died , my life has been weary and dreary ;</l>
       <l n="51">Sick at heart have I been , beyond the healing of friendship .</l>
       <l n="52">Oft in my lonely hours have I thought of the maiden Priscilla .</l>
       <l n="53">She is alone in the world ; her father and mother and brother</l>
       <l n="54">Died in the winter together ; I saw her going and coming ,</l>
       <l n="55">Now to the grave of the dead , and now to the bed of the dying ,</l>
       <l n="56">Patient , courageous , and strong , and said to myself , that if ever</l>
       <l n="57">There were angels on earth , as there are angels in heaven ,</l>
       <l n="58">Two have I seen and known ; and the angel whose name is Priscilla</l>
       <l n="59">Holds in my desolate life the place which the other abandoned .</l>
       <l n="60">Long have I cherished the thought , but never have dared to reveal it ,</l>
       <l n="61">Being a coward in this , though valiant enough for the most part .</l>
       <l n="62">Go to the damsel Priscilla , the loveliest maiden of Plymouth ,</l>
       <l n="63">Say that a blunt old Captain , a man not of words but of actions ,</l>
       <l n="64">Offers his hand and his heart , the hand and heart of a soldier .</l>
       <l n="65">Not in these words , you know , but this in short is my meaning ;</l>
       <l n="66">I am a maker of war , and not a maker of phrases .</l>
       <l n="67">You , who are bred as a scholar , can say it in elegant language ,</l>
       <l n="68">Such as you read in your books of the pleadings and wooings of lovers ,</l>
       <l n="69">Such as you think best adapted to win the heart of a maiden . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="70">When he had spoken , John Alden , the fair-haired , taciturn stripling ,</l>
       <l n="71">All aghast at his words , surprised , embarrassed , bewildered ,</l>
       <l n="72">Trying to mask his dismay by treating the subject with lightness ,</l>
       <l n="73">Trying to smile , and yet feeling his heart stand still in his bosom ,</l>
       <l n="74">Just as a timepiece stops in a house that is stricken by lightning ,</l>
       <l n="75">Thus made answer and spake , or rather stammered than answered :</l>
       <l n="76">“ Such a message as that , I am sure I should mangle and mar it ;</l>
       <l n="77">If you would have it well done ,— I am only repeating your maxim ,—</l>
       <l n="78">You must do it yourself , you must not leave it to others ! ”</l>
       <l n="79">But with the air of a man whom nothing can turn from his purpose ,</l>
       <l n="80">Gravely shaking his head , made answer the Captain of Plymouth :</l>
       <l n="81">“ Truly the maxim is good , and I do not mean to gainsay it ;</l>
       <l n="82">But we must use it discreetly , and not waste powder for nothing .</l>
       <l n="83">Now , as I said before , I was never a maker of phrases .</l>
       <l n="84">I can march up to a fortress and summon the place to surrender ,</l>
       <l n="85">But march up to a woman with such a proposal , I dare not .</l>
       <l n="86">I 'm not afraid of bullets , nor shot from the mouth of a cannon ,</l>
       <l n="87">But of a thundering “ No ! ” point-blank from the mouth of a woman ,</l>
       <l n="88">That I confess I 'm afraid of , nor am I ashamed to confess it !</l>
       <l n="89">So you must grant my request , for you are an elegant scholar ,</l>
       <l n="90">Having the graces of speech , and skill in the turning of phrases . ”</l>
       <l n="91">Taking the hand of his friend , who still was reluctant and doubtful ,</l>
       <l n="92">Holding it long in his own , and pressing it kindly , he added :</l>
       <l n="93">“ Though I have spoken thus lightly , yet deep is the feeling that prompts me ;</l>
       <l n="94">Surely you cannot refuse what I ask in the name of our friendship ! ”</l>
       <l n="95">Then made answer John Alden : “ The name of friendship is sacred ;</l>
       <l n="96">What you demand in that name , I have not the power to deny you ! ”</l>
       <l n="97">So the strong will prevailed , subduing and moulding the gentler ,</l>
       <l n="98">Friendship prevailed over love , and Alden went on his errand .</l>

     <lg type="poem">
      <head>THE LOVER 'S ERRAND</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">So the strong will prevailed , and Alden went on his errand ,</l>
       <l n="2">Out of the street of the village , and into the paths of the forest ,</l>
       <l n="3">Into the tranquil woods , where blue-birds and robins were building</l>
       <l n="4">Towns in the populous trees , with hanging gardens of verdure ,</l>
       <l n="5">Peaceful , aerial cities of joy and affection and freedom .</l>
       <l n="6">All around him was calm , but within him commotion and conflict ,</l>
       <l n="7">Love contending with friendship , and self with each generous impulse .</l>
       <l n="8">To and fro in his breast his thoughts were heaving and dashing ,</l>
       <l n="9">As in a foundering ship , with every roll of the vessel ,</l>
       <l n="10">Washes the bitter sea , the merciless surge of the ocean !</l>
       <l n="11">“ Must I relinquish it all , ” he cried with a wild lamentation ,</l>
       <l n="12">“ Must I relinquish it all , the joy , the hope , the illusion ?</l>
       <l n="13">Was it for this I have loved , and waited , and worshipped in silence ?</l>
       <l n="14">Was it for this I have followed the flying feet and the shadow</l>
       <l n="15">Over the wintry sea , to the desolate shores of New England ?</l>
       <l n="16">Truly the heart is deceitful , and out of its depths of corruption</l>
       <l n="17">Rise , like an exhalation , the misty phantoms of passion ;</l>
       <l n="18">Angels of light they seem , but are only delusions of Satan .</l>
       <l n="19">All is clear to me now ; I feel it , I see it distinctly !</l>
       <l n="20">This is the hand of the Lord ; it is laid upon me in anger ,</l>
       <l n="21">For I have followed too much the heart 's desires and devices ,</l>
       <l n="22">Worshipping Astaroth blindly , and impious idols of Baal .</l>
       <l n="23">This is the cross I must bear ; the sin and the swift retribution . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="24">So through the Plymouth woods John Alden went on his errand ;</l>
       <l n="25">Crossing the brook at the ford , where it brawled over pebble and shallow ,</l>
       <l n="26">Gathering still , as he went , the May-flowers blooming around him ,</l>
       <l n="27">Fragrant , filling the air with a strange and wonderful sweetness ,</l>
       <l n="28">Children lost in the woods , and covered with leaves in their slumber .</l>
       <l n="29">“ Puritan flowers , ” he said , “ and the type of Puritan maidens ,</l>
       <l n="30">Modest and simple and sweet , the very type of Priscilla !</l>
       <l n="31">So I will take them to her ; to Priscilla the May-flower of Plymouth ,</l>
       <l n="32">Modest and simple and sweet , as a parting gift will I take them ;</l>
       <l n="33">Breathing their silent farewells , as they fade and wither and perish ,</l>
       <l n="34">Soon to be thrown away as is the heart of the giver . ”</l>
       <l n="35">So through the Plymouth woods John Alden went on his errand ;</l>
       <l n="36">Came to an open space , and saw the disk of the ocean ,</l>
       <l n="37">Sailless , sombre and cold with the comfortless breath of the east-wind ;</l>
       <l n="38">Saw the new-built house and people at work in a meadow ;</l>
       <l n="39">Heard , as he drew near the door , the musical voice of Priscilla</l>
       <l n="40">Singing the hundredth Psalm , the grand old Puritan anthem ,</l>
       <l n="41">Music that Luther sang to the sacred words of the Psalmist ,</l>
       <l n="42">Full of the breath of the Lord , consoling and comforting many .</l>
       <l n="43">Then , as he opened the door , he beheld the form of the maiden</l>
       <l n="44">Seated beside her wheel , and the carded wool like a snow-drift</l>
       <l n="45">Piled at her knee , her white hands feeding the ravenous spindle ,</l>
       <l n="46">While with her foot on the treadle she guided the wheel in its motion .</l>
       <l n="47">Open wide on her lap lay the well-worn psalm-book of Ainsworth ,</l>
       <l n="48">Printed in Amsterdam , the words and the music together ,</l>
       <l n="49">Rough-hewn , angular notes , like stones in the wall of a churchyard ,</l>
       <l n="50">Darkened and overhung by the running vine of the verses .</l>
       <l n="51">Such was the book from whose pages she sang the old Puritan anthem ,</l>
       <l n="52">She , the Puritan girl , in the solitude of the forest ,</l>
       <l n="53">Making the humble house and the modest apparel of home-spun</l>
       <l n="54">Beautiful with her beauty , and rich with the wealth of her being !</l>
       <l n="55">Over him rushed , like a wind that is keen and cold and relentless ,</l>
       <l n="56">Thoughts of what might have been , and the weight and woe of his errand ;</l>
       <l n="57">All the dreams that had faded , and all the hopes that had vanished ,</l>
       <l n="58">All his life henceforth a dreary and tenantless mansion ,</l>
       <l n="59">Haunted by vain regrets , and pallid , sorrowful faces .</l>
       <l n="60">Still he said to himself , and almost fiercely he said it ,</l>
       <l n="61">“ Let not him that putteth his hand to the plough look backwards ;</l>
       <l n="62">Though the ploughshare cut through the flowers of life to its fountains ,</l>
       <l n="63">Though it pass o'er the graves of the dead and the hearths of the living ,</l>
       <l n="64">It is the will of the Lord ; and his mercy endureth for ever ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="65">So he entered the house : and the hum of the wheel and the singing</l>
       <l n="66">Suddenly ceased ; for Priscilla , aroused by his step on the threshold ,</l>
       <l n="67">Rose as he entered , and gave him her hand , in signal of welcome ,</l>
       <l n="68">Saying , “ I knew it was you , when I heard your step in the passage ;</l>
       <l n="69">For I was thinking of you , as I sat there singing and spinning . ”</l>
       <l n="70">Awkward and dumb with delight , that a thought of him had been mingled</l>
       <l n="71">Thus in the sacred psalm , that came from the heart of the maiden ,</l>
       <l n="72">Silent before her he stood , and gave her the flowers for an answer ,</l>
       <l n="73">Finding no words for his thought . He remembered that day in the winter ,</l>
       <l n="74">After the first great snow , when he broke a path from the village ,</l>
       <l n="75">Reeling and plunging along through the drifts that encumbered the doorway ,</l>
       <l n="76">Stamping the snow from his feet as he entered the house , and Priscilla</l>
       <l n="77">Laughed at his snowy locks , and gave him a seat by the fireside ,</l>
       <l n="78">Grateful and pleased to know he had thought of her in the snow-storm .</l>
       <l n="79">Had he but spoken then ! perhaps not in vain had he spoken ;</l>
       <l n="80">Now it was all too late ; the golden moment had vanished !</l>
       <l n="81">So he stood there abashed , and gave her the flowers for an answer .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="82">Then they sat down and talked of the birds and the beautiful Spring-time ,</l>
       <l n="83">Talked of their friends at home , and the Mayflower that sailed on the morrow .</l>
       <l n="84">“ I have been thinking all day , ” said gently the Puritan maiden ,</l>
       <l n="85">“ Dreaming all night , and thinking all day , of the hedge-rows of England ,—</l>
       <l n="86">They are in blossom now , and the country is all like a garden ;</l>
       <l n="87">Thinking of lanes and fields , and the song of the lark and the linnet ,</l>
       <l n="88">Seeing the village street , and familiar faces of neighbors</l>
       <l n="89">Going about as of old , and stopping to gossip together ,</l>
       <l n="90">And , at the end of the street , the village church , with the ivy</l>
       <l n="91">Climbing the old gray tower , and the quiet graves in the churchyard .</l>
       <l n="92">Kind are the people I live with , and dear to me my religion ;</l>
       <l n="93">Still my heart is so sad , that I wish myself back in Old England .</l>
       <l n="94">You will say it is wrong , but I cannot help it : I almost</l>
       <l n="95">Wish myself back in Old England , I feel so lonely and wretched . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="96">Thereupon answered the youth :— “ Indeed I do not condemn you ;</l>
       <l n="97">Stouter hearts than a woman 's have quailed in this terrible winter .</l>
       <l n="98">Yours is tender and trusting , and needs a stronger to lean on ;</l>
       <l n="99">So I have come to you now , with an offer and proffer of marriage</l>
       <l n="100">Made by a good man and true , Miles Standish the Captain of Plymouth ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="101">Thus he delivered his message , the dexterous writer of letters ,—</l>
       <l n="102">Did not embellish the theme , nor array it in beautiful phrases ,</l>
       <l n="103">But came straight to the point , and blurted it out like a schoolboy ;</l>
       <l n="104">Even the Captain himself could hardly have said it more bluntly .</l>
       <l n="105">Mute with amazement and sorrow , Priscilla the Puritan maiden</l>
       <l n="106">Looked into Alden 's face , her eyes dilated with wonder ,</l>
       <l n="107">Feeling his words like a blow , that stunned her and rendered her speechless ;</l>
       <l n="108">Till at length she exclaimed , interrupting the ominous silence :</l>
       <l n="109">“ If the great Captain of Plymouth is so very eager to wed me ,</l>
       <l n="110">Why does he not come himself , and take the trouble to woo me ?</l>
       <l n="111">If I am not worth the wooing , I surely am not worth the winning ! ”</l>
       <l n="112">Then John Alden began explaining and smoothing the matter ,</l>
       <l n="113">Making it worse as he went , by saying the Captain was busy ,—</l>
       <l n="114">Had no time for such things ;— such things ! the words grating harshly</l>
       <l n="115">Fell on the ear of Priscilla ; and swift as a flash she made answer :</l>
       <l n="116">“ Has he no time for such things , as you call it , before he is married ,</l>
       <l n="117">Would he be likely to find it , or make it , after the wedding ?</l>
       <l n="118">That is the way with you men ; you do n't understand us , you cannot .</l>
       <l n="119">When you have made up your minds , after thinking of this one and that one ,</l>
       <l n="120">Choosing , selecting , rejecting , comparing one with another ,</l>
       <l n="121">Then you make known your desire , with abrupt and sudden avowal ,</l>
       <l n="122">And are offended and hurt , and indignant perhaps , that a woman</l>
       <l n="123">Does not respond at once to a love that she never suspected ,</l>
       <l n="124">Does not attain at a bound the height to which you have been climbing .</l>
       <l n="125">This is not right nor just : for surely a woman 's affection</l>
       <l n="126">Is not a thing to be asked for , and had for only the asking .</l>
       <l n="127">When one is truly in love , one not only says it , but shows it .</l>
       <l n="128">Had he but waited awhile , had he only showed that he loved me ,</l>
       <l n="129">Even this Captain of yours — who knows ?— at last might have won me ,</l>
       <l n="130">Old and rough as he is ; but now it never can happen . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="131">Still John Alden went on , unheeding the words of Priscilla ,</l>
       <l n="132">Urging the suit of his friend , explaining , persuading , expanding ;</l>
       <l n="133">Spoke of his courage and skill , and of all his battles in Flanders ,</l>
       <l n="134">How with the people of God he had chosen to suffer affliction ,</l>
       <l n="135">How , in return for his zeal , they had made him Captain of Plymouth ;</l>
       <l n="136">He was a gentleman born , could trace his pedigree plainly</l>
       <l n="137">Back to Hugh Standish of Duxbury Hall , in Lancashire , England ,</l>
       <l n="138">Who was the son of Ralph , and the grandson of Thurston de Standish ;</l>
       <l n="139">Heir unto vast estates , of which he was basely defrauded ,</l>
       <l n="140">Still bore the family arms , and had for his crest a cock argent</l>
       <l n="141">Combed and wattled gules , and all the rest of the blazon .</l>
       <l n="142">He was a man of honor , of noble and generous nature ;</l>
       <l n="143">Though he was rough , he was kindly ; she knew how during the winter</l>
       <l n="144">He had attended the sick , with a hand as gentle as woman 's ;</l>
       <l n="145">Somewhat hasty and hot , he could not deny it , and headstrong ,</l>
       <l n="146">Stern as a soldier might be , but hearty , and placable always ,</l>
       <l n="147">Not to be laughed at and scorned , because he was little of stature ;</l>
       <l n="148">For he was great of heart , magnanimous , courtly , courageous ;</l>
       <l n="149">Any woman in Plymouth , nay , any woman in England ,</l>
       <l n="150">Might be happy and proud to be called the wife of Miles Standish !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="151">But as he warmed and glowed , in his simple and eloquent language ,</l>
       <l n="152">Quite forgetful of self , and full of the praise of his rival ,</l>
       <l n="153">Archly the maiden smiled , and , with eyes over-running with laughter ,</l>
       <l n="154">Said , in a tremulous voice , “ Why do n't you speak for yourself , John ? ”</l>
      </lg>

     <lg type="poem">
      <head>JOHN ALDEN</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Into the open air John Alden , perplexed and bewildered ,</l>
       <l n="2">Rushed like a man insane , and wandered alone by the sea-side ;</l>
       <l n="3">Paced up and down the sands , and bared his head to the east-wind ,</l>
       <l n="4">Cooling his heated brow , and the fire and fever within him .</l>
       <l n="5">Slowly as out of the heavens , with apocalyptical splendors ,</l>
       <l n="6">Sank the City of God , in the vision of John the Apostle ,</l>
       <l n="7">So , with its cloudy walls of chrysolite , jasper , and sapphire ,</l>
       <l n="8">Sank the broad red sun , and over its turrets uplifted</l>
       <l n="9">Glimmered the golden reed of the angel who measured the city .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="10">“ Welcome , O wind of the East ! ” he exclaimed in his wild exultation ,</l>
       <l n="11">“ Welcome , O wind of the East , from the caves of the misty Atlantic !</l>
       <l n="12">Blowing o'er fields of dulse , and measureless meadows of sea-grass ,</l>
       <l n="13">Blowing o'er rocky wastes , and the grottos and gardens of ocean !</l>
       <l n="14">Lay thy cold , moist hand on my burning forehead , and wrap me</l>
       <l n="15">Close in thy garments of mist , to allay the fever within me ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="16">Like an awakened conscience , the sea was moaning and tossing ,</l>
       <l n="17">Beating remorseful and loud the mutable sands of the sea-shore .</l>
       <l n="18">Fierce in his soul was the struggle and tumult of passions contending ;</l>
       <l n="19">Love triumphant and crowned , and friendship wounded and bleeding ,</l>
       <l n="20">Passionate cries of desire , and importunate pleadings of duty !</l>
       <l n="21">“ Is it my fault , ” he said , “ that the maiden has chosen between us ?</l>
       <l n="22">Is it my fault that he failed ,— my fault that I am the victor ? ”</l>
       <l n="23">Then within him there thundered a voice , like the voice of the Prophet :</l>
       <l n="24">“ It hath displeased the Lord ! ” — and he thought of David 's transgression ,</l>
       <l n="25">Bathsheba 's beautiful face , and his friend in the front of the battle !</l>
       <l n="26">Shame and confusion of guilt , and abasement and self-condemnation ,</l>
       <l n="27">Overwhelmed him at once ; and he cried in the deepest contrition :</l>
       <l n="28">“ It hath displeased the Lord ! It is the temptation of Satan ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="29">Then , uplifting his head , he looked at the sea , and beheld there</l>
       <l n="30">Dimly the shadowy form of the Mayflower riding at anchor ,</l>
       <l n="31">Rocked on the rising tide , and ready to sail on the morrow ;</l>
       <l n="32">Heard the voices of men through the mist , the rattle of cordage</l>
       <l n="33">Thrown on the deck , the shouts of the mate , and the sailors ’ “ Ay , ay , Sir ! ”</l>
       <l n="34">Clear and distinct , but not loud , in the dripping air of the twilight .</l>
       <l n="35">Still for a moment he stood , and listened , and stared at the vessel ,</l>
       <l n="36">Then went hurriedly on , as one who , seeing a phantom ,</l>
       <l n="37">Stops , then quickens his pace , and follows the beckoning shadow .</l>
       <l n="38">“ Yes , it is plain to me now , ” he murmured ; “ the hand of the Lord is</l>
       <l n="39">Leading me out of the land of darkness , the bondage of error ,</l>
       <l n="40">Through the sea , that shall lift the walls of its waters around me ,</l>
       <l n="41">Hiding me , cutting me off , from the cruel thoughts that pursue me .</l>
       <l n="42">Back will I go o'er the ocean , this dreary land will abandon ,</l>
       <l n="43">Her whom I may not love , and him whom my heart has offended .</l>
       <l n="44">Better to be in my grave in the green old churchyard in England ,</l>
       <l n="45">Close by my mother 's side , and among the dust of my kindred ;</l>
       <l n="46">Better be dead and forgotten , than living in shame and dishonor !</l>
       <l n="47">Sacred and safe and unseen , in the dark of the narrow chamber</l>
       <l n="48">With me my secret shall lie , like a buried jewel that glimmers</l>
       <l n="49">Bright on the hand that is dust , in the chambers of silence and darkness ,—</l>
       <l n="50">Yes , as the marriage ring of the great espousal hereafter ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="51">Thus as he spake , he turned , in the strength of his strong resolution ,</l>
       <l n="52">Leaving behind him the shore , and hurried along in the twilight ,</l>
       <l n="53">Through the congenial gloom of the forest silent and sombre ,</l>
       <l n="54">Till he beheld the lights in the seven houses of Plymouth ,</l>
       <l n="55">Shining like seven stars in the dusk and mist of the evening .</l>
       <l n="56">Soon he entered his door , and found the redoubtable Captain</l>
       <l n="57">Sitting alone , and absorbed in the martial pages of Caesar ,</l>
       <l n="58">Fighting some great campaign in Hainault or Brabant or Flanders .</l>
       <l n="59">“ Long have you been on your errand , ” he said with a cheery demeanor ,</l>
       <l n="60">Even as one who is waiting an answer , and fears not the issue .</l>
       <l n="61">“ Not far off is the house , although the woods are between us ;</l>
       <l n="62">But you have lingered so long , that while you were going and coming</l>
       <l n="63">I have fought ten battles and sacked and demolished a city .</l>
       <l n="64">Come , sit down , and in order relate to me all that has happened . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="65">Then John Alden spake , and related the wondrous adventure ,</l>
       <l n="66">From beginning to end , minutely , just as it happened ;</l>
       <l n="67">How he had seen Priscilla , and how he had sped in his courtship ,</l>
       <l n="68">Only smoothing a little , and softening down her refusal .</l>
       <l n="69">But when he came at length to the words Priscilla had spoken ,</l>
       <l n="70">Words so tender and cruel : “ Why do n't you speak for yourself , John ? ”</l>
       <l n="71">Up leaped the Captain of Plymouth , and stamped on the floor , till his armor</l>
       <l n="72">Clanged on the wall , where it hung , with a sound of sinister omen .</l>
       <l n="73">All his pent-up wrath burst forth in a sudden explosion ,</l>
       <l n="74">Even as a hand-grenade , that scatters destruction around it .</l>
       <l n="75">Wildly he shouted , and loud : “ John Alden ! you have betrayed me !</l>
       <l n="76">Me , Miles Standish , your friend ! have supplanted , defrauded , betrayed me !</l>
       <l n="77">One of my ancestors ran his sword through the heart of Wat Tyler ;</l>
       <l n="78">Who shall prevent me from running my own through the heart of a traitor ?</l>
       <l n="79">Yours is the greater treason , for yours is a treason to friendship !</l>
       <l n="80">You , who lived under my roof , whom I cherished and loved as a brother ;</l>
       <l n="81">You , who have fed at my board , and drunk at my cup , to whose keeping</l>
       <l n="82">I have intrusted my honor , my thoughts the most sacred and secret ,—</l>
       <l n="83">You too , Brutus ! ah woe to the name of friendship hereafter !</l>
       <l n="84">Brutus was Caesar 's friend , and you were mine , but henceforward</l>
       <l n="85">Let there be nothing between us save war , and implacable hatred ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="86">So spake the Captain of Plymouth , and strode about in the chamber ,</l>
       <l n="87">Chafing and choking with rage ; like cords were the veins on his temples .</l>
       <l n="88">But in the midst of his anger a man appeared at the doorway ,</l>
       <l n="89">Bringing in uttermost haste a message of urgent importance ,</l>
       <l n="90">Rumors of danger and war and hostile incursions of Indians !</l>
       <l n="91">Straightway the Captain paused , and , without further question or parley ,</l>
       <l n="92">Took from the nail on the wall his sword with its scabbard of iron ,</l>
       <l n="93">Buckled the belt round his waist , and , frowning fiercely , departed .</l>
       <l n="94">Alden was left alone . He heard the clank of the scabbard</l>
       <l n="95">Growing fainter and fainter , and dying away in the distance .</l>
       <l n="96">Then he arose from his seat , and looked forth into the darkness ,</l>
       <l n="97">Felt the cool air blow on his cheek , that was hot with the insult ,</l>
       <l n="98">Lifted his eyes to the heavens , and , folding his hands as in childhood ,</l>
       <l n="99">Prayed in the silence of night to the Father who seeth in secret .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="100">Meanwhile the choleric Captain strode wrathful away to the council ,</l>
       <l n="101">Found it already assembled , impatiently waiting his coming ;</l>
       <l n="102">Men in the middle of life , austere and grave in deportment ,</l>
       <l n="103">Only one of them old , the hill that was nearest to heaven ,</l>
       <l n="104">Covered with snow , but erect , the excellent Elder of Plymouth .</l>
       <l n="105">God had sifted three kingdoms to find the wheat for this planting ,</l>
       <l n="106">Then had sifted the wheat , as the living seed of a nation ;</l>
       <l n="107">So say the chronicles old , and such is the faith of the people !</l>
       <l n="108">Near them was standing an Indian , in attitude stern and defiant ,</l>
       <l n="109">Naked down to the waist , and grim and ferocious in aspect ;</l>
       <l n="110">While on the table before them was lying unopened a Bible ,</l>
       <l n="111">Ponderous , bound in leather , brass-studded , printed in Holland ,</l>
       <l n="112">And beside it outstretched the skin of a rattle-snake glittered ,</l>
       <l n="113">Filled , like a quiver , with arrows ; a signal and challenge of warfare ,</l>
       <l n="114">Brought by the Indian , and speaking with arrowy tongues of defiance .</l>
       <l n="115">This Miles Standish beheld , as he entered , and heard them debating</l>
       <l n="116">What were an answer befitting the hostile message and menace ,</l>
       <l n="117">Talking of this and of that , contriving , suggesting , objecting ;</l>
       <l n="118">One voice only for peace , and that the voice of the Elder ,</l>
       <l n="119">Judging it wise and well that some at least were converted ,</l>
       <l n="120">Rather than any were slain , for this was but Christian behavior !</l>
       <l n="121">Then out spake Miles Standish , the stalwart Captain of Plymouth ,</l>
       <l n="122">Muttering deep in his throat , for his voice was husky with anger ,</l>
       <l n="123">“ What ! do you mean to make war with milk and the water of roses ?</l>
       <l n="124">Is it to shoot red squirrels you have your howitzer planted</l>
       <l n="125">There on the roof of the church , or is it to shoot red devils ?</l>
       <l n="126">Truly the only tongue that is understood by a savage</l>
       <l n="127">Must be the tongue of fire that speaks from the mouth of the cannon ! ”</l>
       <l n="128">Thereupon answered and said the excellent Elder of Plymouth ,</l>
       <l n="129">Somewhat amazed and alarmed at this irreverent language :</l>
       <l n="130">“ Not so thought Saint Paul , nor yet the other Apostles ;</l>
       <l n="131">Not from the cannon 's mouth were the tongues of fire they spake with ! ”</l>
       <l n="132">But unheeded fell this mild rebuke on the Captain ,</l>
       <l n="133">Who had advanced to the table , and thus continued discoursing :</l>
       <l n="134">“ Leave this matter to me , for to me by right it pertaineth .</l>
       <l n="135">War is a terrible trade ; but in the cause that is righteous ,</l>
       <l n="136">Sweet is the smell of powder ; and thus I answer the challenge ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="137">Then from the rattlesnake 's skin , with a sudden , contemptuous gesture ,</l>
       <l n="138">Jerking the Indian arrows , he filled it with powder and bullets</l>
       <l n="139">Full to the very jaws , and handed it back to the savage ,</l>
       <l n="140">Saying , in thundering tones : “ Here , take it ! this is your answer ! ”</l>
       <l n="141">Silently out of the room then glided the glistening savage ,</l>
       <l n="142">Bearing the serpent 's skin , and seeming himself like a serpent ,</l>
       <l n="143">Winding his sinuous way in the dark to the depths of the forest .</l>

      <head>THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Just in the gray of the dawn , as the mists uprose from the meadows ,</l>
       <l n="2">There was a stir and a sound in the slumbering village of Plymouth ;</l>
       <l n="3">Clanging and clicking of arms , and the order imperative , “ Forward ! ”</l>
       <l n="4">Given in tone suppressed , a tramp of feet , and then silence .</l>
       <l n="5">Figures ten , in the mist , marched slowly out of the village .</l>
       <l n="6">Standish the stalwart it was , with eight of his valorous army ,</l>
       <l n="7">Led by their Indian guide , by Hobomok , friend of the white men ,</l>
       <l n="8">Northward marching to quell the sudden revolt of the savage .</l>
       <l n="9">Giants they seemed in the mist , or the mighty men of King David ;</l>
       <l n="10">Giants in heart they were , who believed in God and the Bible ,—</l>
       <l n="11">Ay , who believed in the smiting of Midianites and Philistines .</l>
       <l n="12">Over them gleamed far off the crimson banners of morning ;</l>
       <l n="13">Under them loud on the sands , the serried billows , advancing ,</l>
       <l n="14">Fired along the line , and in regular order retreated .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="15">Many a mile had they marched , when at length the village of Plymouth</l>
       <l n="16">Woke from its sleep , and arose , intent on its manifold labors .</l>
       <l n="17">Sweet was the air and soft ; and slowly the smoke from the chimneys</l>
       <l n="18">Rose over roofs of thatch , and pointed steadily eastward ;</l>
       <l n="19">Men came forth from the doors , and paused and talked of the weather ,</l>
       <l n="20">Said that the wind had changed , and was blowing fair for the Mayflower ;</l>
       <l n="21">Talked of their Captain 's departure , and all the dangers that menaced ,</l>
       <l n="22">He being gone , the town , and what should be done in his absence .</l>
       <l n="23">Merrily sang the birds , and the tender voices of women</l>
       <l n="24">Consecrated with hymns the common cares of the household .</l>
       <l n="25">Out of the sea rose the sun , and the billows rejoiced at his coming ;</l>
       <l n="26">Beautiful were his feet on the purple tops of the mountains ;</l>
       <l n="27">Beautiful on the sails of the Mayflower riding at anchor ,</l>
       <l n="28">Battered and blackened and worn by all the storms of the winter .</l>
       <l n="29">Loosely against her masts was hanging and flapping her canvas ,</l>
       <l n="30">Rent by so many gales , and patched by the hands of the sailors .</l>
       <l n="31">Suddenly from her side , as the sun rose over the ocean ,</l>
       <l n="32">Darted a puff of smoke , and floated seaward ; anon rang</l>
       <l n="33">Loud over field and forest the cannon 's roar , and the echoes</l>
       <l n="34">Heard and repeated the sound , the signal-gun of departure !</l>
       <l n="35">Ah ! but with louder echoes replied the hearts of the people !</l>
       <l n="36">Meekly , in voices subdued , the chapter was read from the Bible ,</l>
       <l n="37">Meekly the prayer was begun , but ended in fervent entreaty !</l>
       <l n="38">Then from their houses in haste came forth the Pilgrims of Plymouth ,</l>
       <l n="39">Men and women and children , all hurrying down to the sea-shore ,</l>
       <l n="40">Eager , with tearful eyes , to say farewell to the Mayflower ,</l>
       <l n="41">Homeward bound o'er the sea , and leaving them here in the desert .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="42">Foremost among them was Alden . All night he had lain without slumber ,</l>
       <l n="43">Turning and tossing about in the heat and unrest of his fever .</l>
       <l n="44">He had beheld Miles Standish , who came back late from the council ,</l>
       <l n="45">Stalking into the room , and heard him mutter and murmur ,</l>
       <l n="46">Sometimes it seemed a prayer , and sometimes it sounded like swearing .</l>
       <l n="47">Once he had come to the bed , and stood there a moment in silence ;</l>
       <l n="48">Then he had turned away , and said : “ I will not awake him ;</l>
       <l n="49">Let him sleep on , it is best ; for what is the use of more talking ! ”</l>
       <l n="50">Then he extinguished the light , and threw himself down on his pallet ,</l>
       <l n="51">Dressed as he was , and ready to start at the break of the morning ,—</l>
       <l n="52">Covered himself with the cloak he had worn in his campaigns in Flanders ,—</l>
       <l n="53">Slept as a soldier sleeps in his bivouac , ready for action .</l>
       <l n="54">But with the dawn he arose ; in the twilight Alden beheld him</l>
       <l n="55">Put on his corselet of steel , and all the rest of his armor ,</l>
       <l n="56">Buckle about his waist his trusty blade of Damascus ,</l>
       <l n="57">Take from the corner his musket , and so stride out of the chamber .</l>
       <l n="58">Often the heart of the youth had burned and yearned to embrace him ,</l>
       <l n="59">Often his lips had essayed to speak , imploring for pardon ;</l>
       <l n="60">All the old friendship came back , with its tender and grateful emotions ;</l>
       <l n="61">But his pride overmastered the nobler nature within him ,—</l>
       <l n="62">Pride , and the sense of his wrong , and the burning fire of the insult .</l>
       <l n="63">So he beheld his friend departing in anger , but spake not ,</l>
       <l n="64">Saw him go forth to danger , perhaps to death , and he spake not !</l>
       <l n="65">Then he arose from his bed , and heard what the people were saying ,</l>
       <l n="66">Joined in the talk at the door , with Stephen and Richard and Gilbert ,</l>
       <l n="67">Joined in the morning prayer , and in the reading of Scripture ,</l>
       <l n="68">And , with the others , in haste went hurrying down to the sea-shore ,</l>
       <l n="69">Down to the Plymouth Rock , that had been to their feet as a door-step</l>
       <l n="70">Into a world unknown ,— the corner-stone of a nation !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="71">There with his boat was the Master , already a little impatient</l>
       <l n="72">Lest he should lose the tide , or the wind might shift to the eastward ,</l>
       <l n="73">Square-built , hearty , and strong , with an odor of ocean about him ,</l>
       <l n="74">Speaking with this one and that , and cramming letters and parcels</l>
       <l n="75">Into his pockets capacious , and messages mingled together</l>
       <l n="76">Into his narrow brain , till at last he was wholly bewildered .</l>
       <l n="77">Nearer the boat stood Alden , with one foot placed on the gunwale ,</l>
       <l n="78">One still firm on the rock , and talking at times with the sailors ,</l>
       <l n="79">Seated erect on the thwarts , all ready and eager for starting .</l>
       <l n="80">He too was eager to go , and thus put an end to his anguish ,</l>
       <l n="81">Thinking to fly from despair , that swifter than keel is or canvas ,</l>
       <l n="82">Thinking to drown in the sea the ghost that would rise and pursue him .</l>
       <l n="83">But as he gazed on the crowd , he beheld the form of Priscilla</l>
       <l n="84">Standing dejected among them , unconscious of all that was passing .</l>
       <l n="85">Fixed were her eyes upon his , as if she divined his intention ,</l>
       <l n="86">Fixed with a look so sad , so reproachful , imploring , and patient ,</l>
       <l n="87">That with a sudden revulsion his heart recoiled from its purpose ,</l>
       <l n="88">As from the verge of a crag , where one step more is destruction .</l>
       <l n="89">Strange is the heart of man , with its quick , mysterious instincts !</l>
       <l n="90">Strange is the life of man , and fatal or fated are moments ,</l>
       <l n="91">Whereupon turn , as on hinges , the gates of the wall adamantine !</l>
       <l n="92">“ Here I remain ! ” he exclaimed , as he looked at the heavens above him ,</l>
       <l n="93">Thanking the Lord whose breath had scattered the mist and the madness ,</l>
       <l n="94">Wherein , blind and lost , to death he was staggering headlong .</l>
       <l n="95">“ Yonder snow-white cloud , that floats in the ether above me ,</l>
       <l n="96">Seems like a hand that is pointing and beckoning over the ocean .</l>
       <l n="97">There is another hand , that is not so spectral and ghost-like ,</l>
       <l n="98">Holding me , drawing me back , and clasping mine for protection .</l>
       <l n="99">Float , O hand of cloud , and vanish away in the ether !</l>
       <l n="100">Roll thyself up like a fist , to threaten and daunt me ; I heed not</l>
       <l n="101">Either your warning or menace , or any omen of evil !</l>
       <l n="102">There is no land so sacred , no air so pure and so wholesome ,</l>
       <l n="103">As is the air she breathes , and the soil that is pressed by her footsteps .</l>
       <l n="104">Here for her sake will I stay , and like an invisible presence</l>
       <l n="105">Hover around her for ever , protecting , supporting her weakness ;</l>
       <l n="106">Yes ! as my foot was the first that stepped on this rock at the landing ,</l>
       <l n="107">So , with the blessing of God , shall it be the last at the leaving ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="108">Meanwhile the Master alert , but with dignified air and important ,</l>
       <l n="109">Scanning with watchful eye the tide and the wind and the weather ,</l>
       <l n="110">Walked about on the sands ; and the people crowded around him</l>
       <l n="111">Saying a few last words , and enforcing his careful remembrance .</l>
       <l n="112">Then , taking each by the hand , as if he were grasping a tiller ,</l>
       <l n="113">Into the boat he sprang , and in haste shoved off to his vessel ,</l>
       <l n="114">Glad in his heart to get rid of all this worry and flurry ,</l>
       <l n="115">Glad to be gone from a land of sand and sickness and sorrow ,</l>
       <l n="116">Short allowance of victual , and plenty of nothing but Gospel !</l>
       <l n="117">Lost in the sound of the oars was the last farewell of the Pilgrims .</l>
       <l n="118">O strong hearts and true ! not one went back in the Mayflower !</l>
       <l n="119">No , not one looked back , who had set his hand to this ploughing !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="120">Soon were heard on board the shouts and songs of the sailors</l>
       <l n="121">Heaving the windlass round , and hoisting the ponderous anchor .</l>
       <l n="122">Then the yards were braced , and all sails set to the west-wind ,</l>
       <l n="123">Blowing steady and strong ; and the Mayflower sailed from the harbor ,</l>
       <l n="124">Rounded the point of the Gurnet , and leaving far to the southward</l>
       <l n="125">Island and cape of sand , and the Field of the First Encounter ,</l>
       <l n="126">Took the wind on her quarter , and stood for the open Atlantic ,</l>
       <l n="127">Borne on the send of the sea , and the swelling hearts of the Pilgrims .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="128">Long in silence they watched the receding sail of the vessel ,</l>
       <l n="129">Much endeared to them all , as something living and human ;</l>
       <l n="130">Then , as if filled with the spirit , and wrapt in a vision prophetic ,</l>
       <l n="131">Baring his hoary head , the excellent Elder of Plymouth</l>
       <l n="132">Said , “ Let us pray ! ” and they prayed , and thanked the Lord and took courage .</l>
       <l n="133">Mournfully sobbed the waves at the base of the rock , and above them</l>
       <l n="134">Bowed and whispered the wheat on the hill of death , and their kindred</l>
       <l n="135">Seemed to awake in their graves , and to join in the prayer that they uttered .</l>
       <l n="136">Sun-illumined and white , on the eastern verge of the ocean</l>
       <l n="137">Gleamed the departing sail , like a marble slab in a graveyard ;</l>
       <l n="138">Buried beneath it lay for ever all hope of escaping .</l>
       <l n="139">Lo ! as they turned to depart , they saw the form of an Indian ,</l>
       <l n="140">Watching them from the hill ; but while they spake with each other ,</l>
       <l n="141">Pointing with outstretched hands , and saying , “ Look ! ” he had vanished .</l>
       <l n="142">So they returned to their homes ; but Alden lingered a little ,</l>
       <l n="143">Musing alone on the shore , and watching the wash of the billows</l>
       <l n="144">Round the base of the rock , and the sparkle and flash of the sunshine ,</l>
       <l n="145">Like the spirit of God , moving visibly over the waters .</l>

      <head>PRISCILLA</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Thus for a while he stood , and mused by the shore of the ocean ,</l>
       <l n="2">Thinking of many things , and most of all of Priscilla ;</l>
       <l n="3">And as if thought had the power to draw to itself , like the loadstone ,</l>
       <l n="4">Whatsoever it touches , by subtile laws of its nature ,</l>
       <l n="5">Lo ! as he turned to depart , Priscilla was standing beside him .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="6">“ Are you so much offended , you will not speak to me ? ” said she .</l>
       <l n="7">“ Am I so much to blame , that yesterday , when you were pleading</l>
       <l n="8">Warmly the cause of another , my heart , impulsive and wayward ,</l>
       <l n="9">Pleaded your own , and spake out , forgetful perhaps of decorum ?</l>
       <l n="10">Certainly you can forgive me for speaking so frankly , for saying</l>
       <l n="11">What I ought not to have said , yet now I can never unsay it ;</l>
       <l n="12">For there are moments in life , when the heart is so full of emotion ,</l>
       <l n="13">That if by chance it be shaken , or into its depths like a pebble</l>
       <l n="14">Drops some careless word , it overflows , and its secret ,</l>
       <l n="15">Spilt on the ground like water , can never be gathered together .</l>
       <l n="16">Yesterday I was shocked , when I heard you speak of Miles Standish ,</l>
       <l n="17">Praising his virtues , transforming his very defects into virtues ,</l>
       <l n="18">Praising his courage and strength , and even his fighting in Flanders ,</l>
       <l n="19">As if by fighting alone you could win the heart of a woman ,</l>
       <l n="20">Quite overlooking yourself and the rest , in exalting your hero .</l>
       <l n="21">Therefore I spake as I did , by an irresistible impulse .</l>
       <l n="22">You will forgive me , I hope , for the sake of the friendship between us ,</l>
       <l n="23">Which is too true and too sacred to be so easily broken ! ”</l>
       <l n="24">Thereupon answered John Alden , the scholar , the friend of Miles Standish :</l>
       <l n="25">“ I was not angry with you , with myself alone I was angry ,</l>
       <l n="26">Seeing how badly I managed the matter I had in my keeping . ”</l>
       <l n="27">“ No ! ” interrupted the maiden , with answer prompt and decisive ;</l>
       <l n="28">“ No ; you were angry with me , for speaking so frankly and freely .</l>
       <l n="29">It was wrong , I acknowledge ; for it is the fate of a woman</l>
       <l n="30">Long to be patient and silent , to wait like a ghost that is speechless ,</l>
       <l n="31">Till some questioning voice dissolves the spell of its silence .</l>
       <l n="32">Hence is the inner life of so many suffering women</l>
       <l n="33">Sunless and silent and deep , like subterranean rivers</l>
       <l n="34">Running through caverns of darkness , unheard , unseen , and unfruitful ,</l>
       <l n="35">Chafing their channels of stone , with endless and profitless murmurs . ”</l>
       <l n="36">Thereupon answered John Alden , the young man , the lover of women :</l>
       <l n="37">“ Heaven forbid it , Priscilla ; and truly they seem to me always</l>
       <l n="38">More like the beautiful rivers that watered the garden of Eden ,</l>
       <l n="39">More like the river Euphrates , through deserts of Havilah flowing ,</l>
       <l n="40">Filling the land with delight , and memories sweet of the garden ! ”</l>
       <l n="41">“ Ah , by these words , I can see , ” again interrupted the maiden ,</l>
       <l n="42">“ How very little you prize me , or care for what I am saying .</l>
       <l n="43">When from the depths of my heart , in pain and with secret misgiving ,</l>
       <l n="44">Frankly I speak to you , asking for sympathy only and kindness ,</l>
       <l n="45">Straightway you take up my words , that are plain and direct and in earnest ,</l>
       <l n="46">Turn them away from their meaning , and answer with flattering phrases .</l>
       <l n="47">This is not right , is not just , is not true to the best that is in you ;</l>
       <l n="48">For I know and esteem you , and feel that your nature is noble ,</l>
       <l n="49">Lifting mine up to a higher , a more ethereal level .</l>
       <l n="50">Therefore I value your friendship , and feel it perhaps the more keenly</l>
       <l n="51">If you say aught that implies I am only as one among many ,</l>
       <l n="52">If you make use of those common and complimentary phrases</l>
       <l n="53">Most men think so fine , in dealing and speaking with women ,</l>
       <l n="54">But which women reject as insipid , if not as insulting . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="55">Mute and amazed was Alden ; and listened and looked at Priscilla ,</l>
       <l n="56">Thinking he never had seen her more fair , more divine in her beauty .</l>
       <l n="57">He who but yesterday pleaded so glibly the cause of another ,</l>
       <l n="58">Stood there embarrassed and silent , and seeking in vain for an answer .</l>
       <l n="59">So the maiden went on , and little divined or imagined</l>
       <l n="60">What was at work in his heart , that made him so awkward and speechless .</l>
       <l n="61">“ Let us , then , be what we are , and speak what we think , and in all things</l>
       <l n="62">Keep ourselves loyal to truth , and the sacred professions of friendship .</l>
       <l n="63">It is no secret I tell you , nor am I ashamed to declare it :</l>
       <l n="64">I have liked to be with you , to see you , to speak with you always .</l>
       <l n="65">So I was hurt at your words , and a little affronted to hear you</l>
       <l n="66">Urge me to marry your friend , though he were the Captain Miles Standish .</l>
       <l n="67">For I must tell you the truth : much more to me is your friendship</l>
       <l n="68">Than all the love he could give , were he twice the hero you think him . ”</l>
       <l n="69">Then she extended her hand , and Alden , who eagerly grasped it ,</l>
       <l n="70">Felt all the wounds in his heart , that were aching and bleeding so sorely ,</l>
       <l n="71">Healed by the touch of that hand , and he said , with a voice full of feeling :</l>
       <l n="72">“ Yes , we must ever be friends ; and of all who offer you friendship</l>
       <l n="73">Let me be ever the first , the truest , the nearest and dearest ! ”</l>

       <l n="74">Casting a farewell look at the glimmering sail of the Mayflower ,</l>
       <l n="75">Distant , but still in sight , and sinking below the horizon ,</l>
       <l n="76">Homeward together they walked , with a strange , indefinite feeling ,</l>
       <l n="77">That all the rest had departed and left them alone in the desert .</l>
       <l n="78">But , as they went through the fields in the blessing and smile of the sunshine ,</l>
       <l n="79">Lighter grew their hearts , and Priscilla said very archly :</l>
       <l n="80">“ Now that our terrible Captain has gone in pursuit of the Indians ,</l>
       <l n="81">Where he is happier far than he would be commanding a household ,</l>
       <l n="82">You may speak boldly , and tell me of all that happened between you ,</l>
       <l n="83">When you returned last night , and said how ungrateful you found me . ”</l>
       <l n="84">Thereupon answered John Alden , and told her the whole of the story ,—</l>
       <l n="85">Told her his own despair , and the direful wrath of Miles Standish .</l>
       <l n="86">Whereat the maiden smiled , and said between laughing and earnest ,</l>
       <l n="87">“ He is a little chimney , and heated hot in a moment ! ”</l>
       <l n="88">But as he gently rebuked her , and told her how much he had suffered ,—</l>
       <l n="89">How he had even determined to sail that day in the Mayflower ,</l>
       <l n="90">And had remained for her sake , on hearing the dangers that threatened ,—</l>
       <l n="91">All her manner was changed , and she said with a faltering accent ,</l>
       <l n="92">“ Truly I thank you for this : how good you have been to me always ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="93">Thus , as a pilgrim devout , who toward Jerusalem journeys ,</l>
       <l n="94">Taking three steps in advance , and one reluctantly backward ,</l>
       <l n="95">Urged by importunate zeal , and withheld by pangs of contrition ;</l>
       <l n="96">Slowly but steadily onward , receding yet ever advancing ,</l>
       <l n="97">Journeyed this Puritan youth to the Holy Land of his longings ,</l>

      <head>THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Meanwhile the stalwart Miles Standish was marching steadily northward ,</l>
       <l n="2">Winding through forest and swamp , and along the trend of the sea-shore ,</l>
       <l n="3">All day long , with hardly a halt , the fire of his anger</l>
       <l n="4">Burning and crackling within , and the sulphurous odor of powder</l>
       <l n="5">Seeming more sweet to his nostrils than all the scents of the forest .</l>
       <l n="6">Silent and moody he went , and much he revolved his discomfort ;</l>
       <l n="7">He who was used to success , and to easy victories always ,</l>
       <l n="8">Thus to be flouted , rejected , and laughed to scorn by a maiden ,</l>
       <l n="9">Thus to be mocked and betrayed by the friend whom most he had trusted !</l>
       <l n="10">Ah ! ‘ t was too much to be borne , and he fretted and chafed in his armor !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="11">“ I alone am to blame , ” he muttered , “ for mine was the folly .</l>
       <l n="12">What has a rough old soldier , grown grim and gray in the harness ,</l>
       <l n="13">Used to the camp and its ways , to do with the wooing of maidens ?</l>
       <l n="14">‘ T was but a dream ,— let it pass ,— let it vanish like so many others !</l>
       <l n="15">What I thought was a flower , is only a weed , and is worthless ;</l>
       <l n="16">Out of my heart will I pluck it , and throw it away , and henceforward</l>
       <l n="17">Be but a fighter of battles , a lover and wooer of dangers ! ”</l>
       <l n="18">Thus he revolved in his mind his sorry defeat and discomfort ,</l>
       <l n="19">While he was marching by day or lying at night in the forest ,</l>
       <l n="20">Looking up at the trees , and the constellations beyond them .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="21">After a three days ’ march he came to an Indian encampment</l>
       <l n="22">Pitched on the edge of a meadow , between the sea and the forest ;</l>
       <l n="23">Women at work by the tents , and the warriors , horrid with war-paint ,</l>
       <l n="24">Seated about a fire , and smoking and talking together ;</l>
       <l n="25">Who , when they saw from afar the sudden approach of the white men ,</l>
       <l n="26">Saw the flash of the sun on breastplate and sabre and musket ,</l>
       <l n="27">Straightway leaped to their feet , and two , from among them advancing ,</l>
       <l n="28">Came to parley with Standish , and offer him furs as a present ;</l>
       <l n="29">Friendship was in their looks , but in their hearts there was hatred .</l>
       <l n="30">Braves of the tribe were these , and brothers gigantic in stature ,</l>
       <l n="31">Huge as Goliath of Gath , or the terrible Og , king of Bashan ;</l>
       <l n="32">One was Pecksuot named , and the other was called Wattawamat .</l>
       <l n="33">Round their necks were suspended their knives in scabbards of wampum ,</l>
       <l n="34">Two-edged , trenchant knives , with points as sharp as a needle .</l>
       <l n="35">Other arms had they none , for they were cunning and crafty .</l>
       <l n="36">“ Welcome , English ! ” they said ,— these words they had learned from the traders</l>
       <l n="37">Touching at times on the coast , to barter and chaffer for peltries .</l>
       <l n="38">Then in their native tongue they began to parley with Standish ,</l>
       <l n="39">Through his guide and interpreter Hobomok , friend of the white man ,</l>
       <l n="40">Begging for blankets and knives , but mostly for muskets and powder ,</l>
       <l n="41">Kept by the white man , they said , concealed , with the plague , in his cellars ,</l>
       <l n="42">Ready to be let loose , and destroy his brother the red man !</l>
       <l n="43">But when Standish refused , and said he would give them the Bible ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="44">Suddenly changing their tone , they began to boast and to bluster .</l>
       <l n="45">Then Wattawamat advanced with a stride in front of the other ,</l>
       <l n="46">And , with a lofty demeanor , thus vauntingly spake to the Captain :</l>
       <l n="47">“ Now Wattawamat can see , by the fiery eyes of the Captain ,</l>
       <l n="48">Angry is he in his heart ; but the heart of the brave Wattawamat</l>
       <l n="49">Is not afraid at the sight . He was not born of a woman ,</l>
       <l n="50">But on a mountain , at night , from an oak-tree riven by lightning ,</l>
       <l n="51">Forth he sprang at a bound , with all his weapons about him ,</l>
       <l n="52">Shouting , ‘ Who is there here to fight with the brave Wattawamat ? ’ ”</l>
       <l n="53">Then he unsheathed his knife , and , whetting the blade on his left hand ,</l>
       <l n="54">Held it aloft and displayed a woman 's face on the handle ,</l>
       <l n="55">Saying , with bitter expression and look of sinister meaning :</l>
       <l n="56">“ I have another at home , with the face of a man on the handle ;</l>
       <l n="57">By and by they shall marry ; and there will be plenty of children ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="58">Then stood Pecksuot forth , self-vaunting , insulting Miles Standish :</l>
       <l n="59">While with his fingers he petted the knife that hung at his bosom ,</l>
       <l n="60">Drawing it half from its sheath , and plunging it back , as he muttered ,</l>
       <l n="61">“ By and by it shall see ; it shall eat ; ah , ha ! but shall speak not !</l>
       <l n="62">This is the mighty Captain the white men have sent to destroy us !</l>
       <l n="63">He is a little man ; let him go and work with the women ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="64">Meanwhile Standish had noted the faces and figures of Indians</l>
       <l n="65">Peeping and creeping about from bush to tree in the forest ,</l>
       <l n="66">Feigning to look for game , with arrows set on their bow-strings ,</l>
       <l n="67">Drawing about him still closer and closer the net of their ambush .</l>
       <l n="68">But undaunted he stood , and dissembled and treated them smoothly ;</l>
       <l n="69">So the old chronicles say , that were writ in the days of the fathers .</l>
       <l n="70">But when he heard their defiance , the boast , the taunt , and the insult ,</l>
       <l n="71">All the hot blood of his race , of Sir Hugh and of Thurston de Standish ,</l>
       <l n="72">Boiled and beat in his heart , and swelled in the veins of his temples .</l>
       <l n="73">Headlong he leaped on the boaster , and , snatching his knife from its scabbard ,</l>
       <l n="74">Plunged it into his heart , and , reeling backward , the savage</l>
       <l n="75">Fell with his face to the sky , and a fiendlike fierceness upon it .</l>
       <l n="76">Straight there arose from the forest the awful sound of the war-whoop ,</l>
       <l n="77">And , like a flurry of snow on the whistling wind of December ,</l>
       <l n="78">Swift and sudden and keen came a flight of feathery arrows ,</l>
       <l n="79">Then came a cloud of smoke , and out of the cloud came the lightning ,</l>
       <l n="80">Out of the lightning thunder , and death unseen ran before it .</l>
       <l n="81">Frightened the savages fled for shelter in swamp and in thicket ,</l>
       <l n="82">Hotly pursued and beset ; but their sachem , the brave Wattawamat ,</l>
       <l n="83">Fled not ; he was dead . Unswerving and swift had a bullet</l>
       <l n="84">Passed through his brain , and he fell with both hands clutching the greensward ,</l>
       <l n="85">Seeming in death to hold back from his foe the land of his fathers .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="86">There on the flowers of the meadow the warriors lay , and above them ,</l>
       <l n="87">Silent , with folded arms , stood Hobomok , friend of the white man .</l>
       <l n="88">Smiling at length he exclaimed to the stalwart Captain of Plymouth :</l>
       <l n="89">“ Pecksuot bragged very loud , of his courage , his strength , and his stature ,—</l>
       <l n="90">Mocked the great Captain , and called him a little man ; but I see now</l>
       <l n="91">Big enough have you been to lay him speechless before you ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="92">Thus the first battle was fought and won by the stalwart Miles Standish .</l>
       <l n="93">When the tidings thereof were brought to the village of Plymouth ,</l>
       <l n="94">And as a trophy of war the head of the brave Wattawamat</l>
       <l n="95">Scowled from the roof of the fort , which at once was a church and a fortress ,</l>
       <l n="96">All who beheld it rejoiced , and praised the Lord , and took courage .</l>
       <l n="97">Only Priscilla averted her face from this spectre of terror ,</l>
       <l n="98">Thanking God in her heart that she had not married Miles Standish ;</l>
       <l n="99">Shrinking , fearing almost , lest , coming home from his battles ,</l>
       <l n="100">He should lay claim to her hand , as the prize and reward of his valor .</l>

      <head>THE SPINNING-WHEEL</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Month after month passed away , and in Autumn the ships of the merchants</l>
       <l n="2">Came with kindred and friends , with cattle and corn for the Pilgrims .</l>
       <l n="3">All in the village was peace ; the men were intent on their labors ,</l>
       <l n="4">Busy with hewing and building , with garden-plot and with merestead ,</l>
       <l n="5">Busy with breaking the glebe , and mowing the grass in the meadows ,</l>
       <l n="6">Searching the sea for its fish , and hunting the deer in the forest .</l>
       <l n="7">All in the village was peace ; but at times the rumor of warfare</l>
       <l n="8">Filled the air with alarm , and the apprehension of danger .</l>
       <l n="9">Bravely the stalwart Miles Standish was scouring the land with his forces ,</l>
       <l n="10">Waxing valiant in fight and defeating the alien armies ,</l>
       <l n="11">Till his name had become a sound of fear to the nations .</l>
       <l n="12">Anger was still in his heart , but at times the remorse and contrition</l>
       <l n="13">Which in all noble natures succeed the passionate outbreak ,</l>
       <l n="14">Came like a rising tide , that encounters the rush of a river ,</l>
       <l n="15">Staying its current awhile , but making it bitter and brackish .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="16">Meanwhile Alden at home had built him a new habitation ,</l>
       <l n="17">Solid , substantial , of timber rough-hewn from the firs of the forest .</l>
       <l n="18">Wooden-barred was the door , and the roof was covered with rushes ;</l>
       <l n="19">Latticed the windows were , and the window-panes were of paper ,</l>
       <l n="20">Oiled to admit the light , while wind and rain were excluded .</l>
       <l n="21">There too he dug a well , and around it planted an orchard :</l>
       <l n="22">Still may be seen to this day some trace of the well and the orchard .</l>
       <l n="23">Close to the house was the stall , where , safe and secure from annoyance ,</l>
       <l n="24">Raghorn , the snow-white steer , that had fallen to Alden 's allotment</l>
       <l n="25">In the division of cattle , might ruminate in the night-time</l>
       <l n="26">Over the pastures he cropped , made fragrant by sweet pennyroyal .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="27">Oft when his labor was finished , with eager feet would the dreamer</l>
       <l n="28">Follow the pathway that ran through the woods to the house of Priscilla ,</l>
       <l n="29">Led by illusions romantic and subtile deceptions of fancy ,</l>
       <l n="30">Pleasure disguised as duty , and love in the semblance of friendship .</l>
       <l n="31">Ever of her he thought , when he fashioned the walls of his dwelling ;</l>
       <l n="32">Ever of her he thought , when he delved in the soil of his garden ;</l>
       <l n="33">Ever of her he thought , when he read in his Bible on Sunday</l>
       <l n="34">Praise of the virtuous woman , as she is described in the Proverbs ,—</l>
       <l n="35">How the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her always ,</l>
       <l n="36">How all the days of her life she will do him good , and not evil ,</l>
       <l n="37">How she seeketh the wool and the flax and worketh with gladness ,</l>
       <l n="38">How she layeth her hand to the spindle and holdeth the distaff ,</l>
       <l n="39">How she is not afraid of the snow for herself or her household ,</l>
       <l n="40">Knowing her household are clothed with the scarlet cloth of her weaving !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="41">So as she sat at her wheel one afternoon in the Autumn ,</l>
       <l n="42">Alden , who opposite sat , and was watching her dexterous fingers ,</l>
       <l n="43">As if the thread she was spinning were that of his life and his fortune ,</l>
       <l n="44">After a pause in their talk , thus spake to the sound of the spindle .</l>
       <l n="45">“ Truly , Priscilla , ” he said , “ when I see you spinning and spinning ,</l>
       <l n="46">Never idle a moment , but thrifty and thoughtful of others ,</l>
       <l n="47">Suddenly you are transformed , are visibly changed in a moment ;</l>
       <l n="48">You are no longer Priscilla , but Bertha the Beautiful Spinner . ”</l>
       <l n="49">Here the light foot on the treadle grew swifter and swifter ; the spindle</l>
       <l n="50">Uttered an angry snarl , and the thread snapped short in her fingers ;</l>
       <l n="51">While the impetuous speaker , not heeding the mischief , continued :</l>
       <l n="52">“ You are the beautiful Bertha , the spinner , the queen of Helvetia ;</l>
       <l n="53">She whose story I read at a stall in the streets of Southampton ,</l>
       <l n="54">Who , as she rode on her palfrey , o'er valley and meadow and mountain ,</l>
       <l n="55">Ever was spinning her thread from a distaff fixed to her saddle .</l>
       <l n="56">She was so thrifty and good , that her name passed into a proverb .</l>
       <l n="57">So shall it be with your own , when the spinning-wheel shall no longer</l>
       <l n="58">Hum in the house of the farmer , and fill its chambers with music .</l>
       <l n="59">Then shall the mothers , reproving , relate how it was in their childhood ,</l>
       <l n="60">Praising the good old times , and the days of Priscilla the spinner ! ”</l>
       <l n="61">Straight uprose from her wheel the beautiful Puritan maiden ,</l>
       <l n="62">Pleased with the praise of her thrift from him whose praise was the sweetest ,</l>
       <l n="63">Drew from the reel on the table a snowy skein of her spinning ,</l>
       <l n="64">Thus making answer , meanwhile , to the flattering phrases of Alden :</l>
       <l n="65">“ Come , you must not be idle ; if I am a pattern for housewives ,</l>
       <l n="66">Show yourself equally worthy of being the model of husbands .</l>
       <l n="67">Hold this skein on your hands , while I wind it , ready for knitting ;</l>
       <l n="68">Then who knows but hereafter , when fashions have changed and the manners ,</l>
       <l n="69">Fathers may talk to their sons of the good old times of John Alden ! ”</l>
       <l n="70">Thus , with a jest and a laugh , the skein on his hands she adjusted ,</l>
       <l n="71">He sitting awkwardly there , with his arms extended before him ,</l>
       <l n="72">She standing graceful , erect , and winding the thread from his fingers ,</l>
       <l n="73">Sometimes chiding a little his clumsy manner of holding ,</l>
       <l n="74">Sometimes touching his hands , as she disentangled expertly</l>
       <l n="75">Twist or knot in the yarn , unawares — for how could she help it ?—</l>
       <l n="76">Sending electrical thrills through every nerve in his body .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="77">Lo ! in the midst of this scene , a breathless messenger entered ,</l>
       <l n="78">Bringing in hurry and heat the terrible news from the village .</l>
       <l n="79">Yes ; Miles Standish was dead !— an Indian had brought them the tidings ,—</l>
       <l n="80">Slain by a poisoned arrow , shot down in the front of the battle ,</l>
       <l n="81">Into an ambush beguiled , cut off with the whole of his forces ;</l>
       <l n="82">All the town would be burned , and all the people be murdered !</l>
       <l n="83">Such were the tidings of evil that burst on the hearts of the hearers .</l>
       <l n="84">Silent and statue-like stood Priscilla , her face looking backward</l>
       <l n="85">Still at the face of the speaker , her arms uplifted in horror ;</l>
       <l n="86">But John Alden , upstarting , as if the barb of the arrow</l>
       <l n="87">Piercing the heart of his friend had struck his own , and had sundered</l>
       <l n="88">Once and for ever the bonds that held him bound as a captive ,</l>
       <l n="89">Wild with excess of sensation , the awful delight of his freedom ,</l>
       <l n="90">Mingled with pain and regret , unconscious of what he was doing ,</l>
       <l n="91">Clasped , almost with a groan , the motionless form of Priscilla ,</l>
       <l n="92">Pressing her close to his heart , as for ever his own , and exclaiming :</l>
       <l n="93">“ Those whom the Lord hath united , let no man put them asunder ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="94">Even as rivulets twain , from distant and separate sources ,</l>
       <l n="95">Seeing each other afar , as they leap from the rocks , and pursuing</l>
       <l n="96">Each one its devious path , but drawing nearer and nearer ,</l>
       <l n="97">Rush together at last , at their trysting-place in the forest ;</l>
       <l n="98">So these lives that had run thus far in separate channels ,</l>

      <head>THE WEDDING-DAY</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Forth from the curtain of clouds , from the tent of purple and scarlet ,</l>
       <l n="2">Issued the sun , the great High-Priest , in his garments resplendent ,</l>
       <l n="3">Holiness unto the Lord , in letters of light , on his forehead ,</l>
       <l n="4">Round the hem of his robe the golden bells and pomegranates .</l>
       <l n="5">Blessing the world he came , and the bars of vapor beneath him</l>
       <l n="6">Gleamed like a grate of brass , and the sea at his feet was a laver !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">This was the wedding morn of Priscilla the Puritan maiden .</l>
       <l n="8">Friends were assembled together ; the Elder and Magistrate also</l>
       <l n="9">Graced the scene with their presence , and stood like the Law and the Gospel ,</l>
       <l n="10">One with the sanction of earth and one with the blessing of heaven .</l>
       <l n="11">Simple and brief was the wedding , as that of Ruth and of Boaz .</l>
       <l n="12">Softly the youth and the maiden repeated the words of betrothal ,</l>
       <l n="13">Taking each other for husband and wife in the Magistrate 's presence ,</l>
       <l n="14">After the Puritan way , and the laudable custom of Holland .</l>
       <l n="15">Fervently then , and devoutly , the excellent Elder of Plymouth</l>
       <l n="16">Prayed for the hearth and the home , that were founded that day in affection ,</l>
       <l n="17">Speaking of life and of death , and imploring divine benedictions .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="18">Lo ! when the service was ended , a form appeared on the threshold ,</l>
       <l n="19">Clad in armor of steel , a sombre and sorrowful figure !</l>
       <l n="20">Why does the bridegroom start and stare at the strange apparition ?</l>
       <l n="21">Why does the bride turn pale , and hide her face on his shoulder ?</l>
       <l n="22">Is it a phantom of air ,— a bodiless , spectral illusion ?</l>
       <l n="23">Is it a ghost from the grave , that has come to forbid the betrothal ?</l>
       <l n="24">Long had it stood there unseen , a guest uninvited , unwelcomed ;</l>
       <l n="25">Over its clouded eyes there had passed at times an expression</l>
       <l n="26">Softening the gloom and revealing the warm heart hidden beneath them ,</l>
       <l n="27">As when across the sky the driving rack of the rain-cloud</l>
       <l n="28">Grows for a moment thin , and betrays the sun by its brightness .</l>
       <l n="29">Once it had lifted its hand , and moved its lips , but was silent ,</l>
       <l n="30">As if an iron will had mastered the fleeting intention .</l>
       <l n="31">But when were ended the troth and the prayer and the last benediction ,</l>
       <l n="32">Into the room it strode , and the people beheld with amazement</l>
       <l n="33">Bodily there in his armor Miles Standish , the Captain of Plymouth !</l>
       <l n="34">Grasping the bridegroom 's hand , he said with emotion , “ Forgive me !</l>
       <l n="35">I have been angry and hurt ,— too long have I cherished the feeling ;</l>
       <l n="36">I have been cruel and hard , but now , thank God ! it is ended .</l>
       <l n="37">Mine is the same hot blood that leaped in the veins of Hugh Standish ,</l>
       <l n="38">Sensitive , swift to resent , but as swift in atoning for error .</l>
       <l n="39">Never so much as now was Miles Standish the friend of John Alden . ”</l>
       <l n="40">Thereupon answered the bridegroom : “ Let all be forgotten between us ,—</l>
       <l n="41">All save the dear , old friendship , and that shall grow older and dearer ! ”</l>
       <l n="42">Then the Captain advanced , and , bowing , saluted Priscilla ,</l>
       <l n="43">Gravely , and after the manner of old-fashioned gentry in England ,</l>
       <l n="44">Something of camp and of court , of town and of country , commingled ,</l>
       <l n="45">Wishing her joy of her wedding , and loudly lauding her husband .</l>
       <l n="46">Then he said with a smile : “ I should have remembered the adage ,—</l>
       <l n="47">If you would be well served , you must serve yourself ; and moreover ,</l>
       <l n="48">No man can gather cherries in Kent at the season of Christmas ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="49">Great was the people 's amazement , and greater yet their rejoicing ,</l>
       <l n="50">Thus to behold once more the sun-burnt face of their Captain ,</l>
       <l n="51">Whom they had mourned as dead ; and they gathered and crowded about him ,</l>
       <l n="52">Eager to see him and hear him , forgetful of bride and of bridegroom ,</l>
       <l n="53">Questioning , answering , laughing , and each interrupting the other ,</l>
       <l n="54">Till the good Captain declared , being quite overpowered and bewildered ,</l>
       <l n="55">He had rather by far break into an Indian encampment ,</l>
       <l n="56">Than come again to a wedding to which he had not been invited .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="57">Meanwhile the bridegroom went forth and stood with the bride at the doorway ,</l>
       <l n="58">Breathing the perfumed air of that warm and beautiful morning .</l>
       <l n="59">Touched with autumnal tints , but lonely and sad in the sunshine ,</l>
       <l n="60">Lay extended before them the land of toil and privation ;</l>
       <l n="61">There were the graves of the dead , and the barren waste of the sea-shore ,</l>
       <l n="62">There the familiar fields , the groves of pine , and the meadows ;</l>
       <l n="63">But to their eyes transfigured , it seemed as the Garden of Eden ,</l>
       <l n="64">Filled with the presence of God , whose voice was the sound of the ocean .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="65">Soon was their vision disturbed by the noise and stir of departure ,</l>
       <l n="66">Friends coming forth from the house , and impatient of longer delaying ,</l>
       <l n="67">Each with his plan for the day , and the work that was left uncompleted .</l>
       <l n="68">Then from a stall near at hand , amid exclamations of wonder ,</l>
       <l n="69">Alden the thoughtful , the careful , so happy , so proud of Priscilla ,</l>
       <l n="70">Brought out his snow-white steer , obeying the hand of its master ,</l>
       <l n="71">Led by a cord that was tied to an iron ring in its nostrils ,</l>
       <l n="72">Covered with crimson cloth , and a cushion placed for a saddle .</l>
       <l n="73">She should not walk , he said , through the dust and heat of the noonday ;</l>
       <l n="74">Nay , she should ride like a queen , not plod along like a peasant .</l>
       <l n="75">Somewhat alarmed at first , but reassured by the others ,</l>
       <l n="76">Placing her hand on the cushion , her foot in the hand of her husband ,</l>
       <l n="77">Gayly , with joyous laugh , Priscilla mounted her palfrey .</l>
       <l n="78">“ Nothing is wanting now , ” he said with a smile , “ but the distaff ;</l>
       <l n="79">Then you would be in truth my queen , my beautiful Bertha ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="80">Onward the bridal procession now moved to their new habitation ,</l>
       <l n="81">Happy husband and wife , and friends conversing together .</l>
       <l n="82">Pleasantly murmured the brook , as they crossed the ford in the forest ,</l>
       <l n="83">Pleased with the image that passed , like a dream of love through its bosom ,</l>
       <l n="84">Tremulous , floating in air , o'er the depths of the azure abysses .</l>
       <l n="85">Down through the golden leaves the sun was pouring his splendors ,</l>
       <l n="86">Gleaming on purple grapes , that , from branches above them suspended ,</l>
       <l n="87">Mingled their odorous breath with the balm of the pine and the fir-tree ,</l>
       <l n="88">Wild and sweet as the clusters that grew in the valley of Eshcol .</l>
       <l n="89">Like a picture it seemed of the primitive , pastoral ages ,</l>
       <l n="90">Fresh with the youth of the world , and recalling Rebecca and Isaac ,</l>
       <l n="91">Old and yet ever new , and simple and beautiful always ,</l>
       <l n="92">Love immortal and young in the endless succession of lovers ,</l>
       <l n="93">So through the Plymouth woods passed onward the bridal procession .</l>

       <l n="1">One Autumn night , in Sudbury town ,</l>
       <l n="2">Across the meadows bare and brown ,</l>
       <l n="3">The windows of the wayside inn</l>
       <l n="4">Gleamed red with fire-light through the leaves</l>
       <l n="5">Of woodbine , hanging from the eaves</l>
       <l n="6">Their crimson curtains rent and thin .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">As ancient is this hostelry</l>
       <l n="8">As any in the land may be ,</l>
       <l n="9">Built in the old Colonial day ,</l>
       <l n="10">When men lived in a grander way ,</l>
       <l n="11">With ampler hospitality ;</l>
       <l n="12">A kind of old Hobgoblin Hall ,</l>
       <l n="13">Now somewhat fallen to decay ,</l>
       <l n="14">With weather-stains upon the wall ,</l>
       <l n="15">And stairways worn , and crazy doors ,</l>
       <l n="16">And creaking and uneven floors ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="18">A region of repose it seems ,</l>
       <l n="19">A place of slumber and of dreams ,</l>
       <l n="20">Remote among the wooded hills !</l>
       <l n="21">For there no noisy railway speeds ,</l>
       <l n="22">Its torch-race scattering smoke and gleeds ;</l>
       <l n="23">But noon and night , the panting teams</l>
       <l n="24">Stop under the great oaks , that throw</l>
       <l n="25">Tangles of light and shade below ,</l>
       <l n="26">On roofs and doors and window-sills .</l>
       <l n="27">Across the road the barns display</l>
       <l n="28">Their lines of stalls , their mows of hay ,</l>
       <l n="29">Through the wide doors the breezes blow ,</l>
       <l n="30">The wattled cocks strut to and fro ,</l>
       <l n="31">And , half effaced by rain and shine ,</l>
       <l n="32">The Red Horse prances on the sign .</l>
       <l n="33">Round this old-fashioned , quaint abode</l>
       <l n="34">Deep silence reigned , save when a gust</l>
       <l n="35">Went rushing down the county road ,</l>
       <l n="36">And skeletons of leaves , and dust ,</l>
       <l n="37">A moment quickened by its breath ,</l>
       <l n="38">Shuddered and danced their dance of death ,</l>
       <l n="39">And through the ancient oaks o'erhead</l>
       <l n="40">Mysterious voices moaned and fled .</l>

       <l n="44">Oft interrupted by the din</l>
       <l n="45">Of laughter and of loud applause ,</l>
       <l n="46">And , in each intervening pause ,</l>
       <l n="47">The music of a violin .</l>
       <l n="48">The fire-light , shedding over all</l>
       <l n="49">The splendor of its ruddy glow ,</l>
       <l n="50">Filled the whole parlor large and low ;</l>
       <l n="51">It gleamed on wainscot and on wall ,</l>

       <l n="56">It played inaudible melodies ,</l>
       <l n="57">It crowned the sombre clock with flame ,</l>
       <l n="58">The hands , the hours , the maker 's name ,</l>

       <l n="63">The jovial rhymes , that still remain ,</l>
       <l n="64">Writ near a century ago ,</l>

       <l n="72">Confessions of its secret thought ,—</l>
       <l n="73">The joy , the triumph , the lament ,</l>
       <l n="74">The exultation and the pain ;</l>
       <l n="75">Then , by the magic of his art ,</l>

       <l n="86">And , though of different lands and speech ,</l>
       <l n="87">Each had his tale to tell , and each</l>
       <l n="88">Was anxious to be pleased and please .</l>

       <l n="1">Listen , my children , and you shall hear</l>
       <l n="2">Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere ,</l>
       <l n="3">On the eighteenth of April , in Seventy-five ;</l>
       <l n="4">Hardly a man is now alive</l>
       <l n="5">Who remembers that famous day and year .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="6">He said to his friend , “ If the British march</l>
       <l n="7">By land or sea from the town to-night ,</l>
       <l n="8">Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch</l>
       <l n="9">Of the North Church tower as a signal light ,—</l>
       <l n="10">One , if by land , and two , if by sea ;</l>
       <l n="11">And I on the opposite shore will be ,</l>
       <l n="12">Ready to ride and spread the alarm</l>
       <l n="13">Through every Middlesex village and farm</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="15">Then he said , “ Good night ! ” and with muffled oar</l>
       <l n="16">Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore ,</l>
       <l n="17">Just as the moon rose over the bay ,</l>
       <l n="18">Where swinging wide at her moorings lay</l>
       <l n="19">The Somerset , British man-of-war ;</l>
       <l n="20">A phantom ship , with each mast and spar</l>
       <l n="21">Across the moon like a prison bar ,</l>
       <l n="22">And a huge black hulk , that was magnified</l>
       <l n="23">By its own reflection in the tide .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="24">Meanwhile , his friend , through alley and street ,</l>

       <l n="27">The muster of men at the barrack door ,</l>
       <l n="28">The sound of arms , and the tramp of feet ,</l>
       <l n="29">And the measured tread of the grenadiers ,</l>
       <l n="30">Marching down to their boats on the shore .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="31">Then he climbed the tower of the Old North Church ,</l>
       <l n="32">By the wooden stairs , with stealthy tread ,</l>
       <l n="33">To the belfry-chamber overhead ,</l>
       <l n="34">And startled the pigeons from their perch</l>
       <l n="35">On the sombre rafters , that round him made</l>
       <l n="36">Masses and moving shapes of shade ,—</l>
       <l n="37">By the trembling ladder , steep and tall</l>
       <l n="38">To the highest window in the wall ,</l>
       <l n="39">Where he paused to listen and look down</l>
       <l n="40">A moment on the roofs of the town ,</l>

       <l n="44">Wrapped in silence so deep and still</l>
       <l n="45">That he could hear , like a sentinel 's tread ,</l>
       <l n="46">The watchful night-wind , as it went</l>

       <l n="48">And seeming to whisper , “ All is well ! ”</l>
       <l n="49">A moment only he feels the spell</l>
       <l n="50">Of the place and the hour , and the secret dread</l>
       <l n="51">Of the lonely belfry and the dead ;</l>
       <l n="52">For suddenly all his thoughts are bent</l>
       <l n="53">On a shadowy something far away ,</l>
       <l n="54">Where the river widens to meet the bay ,—</l>
       <l n="55">A line of black that bends and floats</l>

       <l n="60">Now he patted his horse 's side ,</l>
       <l n="61">Now gazed at the landscape far and near ,</l>
       <l n="62">Then , impetuous , stamped the earth ,</l>
       <l n="63">And turned and tightened his saddle-girth ;</l>

       <l n="65">The belfry-tower of the Old North Church ,</l>
       <l n="66">As it rose above the graves on the hill ,</l>
       <l n="67">Lonely and spectral and sombre and still .</l>
       <l n="68">And lo ! as he looks , on the belfry 's height</l>
       <l n="69">A glimmer , and then a gleam of light !</l>
       <l n="70">He springs to the saddle , the bridle he turns ,</l>
       <l n="71">But lingers and gazes , till full on his sight</l>
       <l n="72">A second lamp in the belfry burns !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="73">A hurry of hoofs in a village street ,</l>

       <l n="76">Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet :</l>
       <l n="77">That was all ! And yet , through the gloom and the light ,</l>
       <l n="78">The fate of a nation was riding that night ;</l>

       <l n="12">His wasted fortunes and his buried love .</l>
       <l n="13">For there , in banquet and in tournament ,</l>
       <l n="14">His wealth had lavished been , his substance spent ,</l>

       <l n="16">Monna Giovanna , who his rival wed ,</l>
       <l n="17">Yet ever in his fancy reigned supreme ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="19">Then he withdrew , in poverty and pain ,</l>
       <l n="20">To this small farm , the last of his domain ,</l>
       <l n="21">His only comfort and his only care</l>
       <l n="22">To prune his vines , and plant the fig and pear ;</l>
       <l n="23">His only forester and only guest</l>
       <l n="24">His falcon , faithful to him , when the rest ,</l>
       <l n="25">Whose willing hands had found so light of yore</l>
       <l n="26">The brazen knocker of his palace door ,</l>
       <l n="27">Had now no strength to lift the wooden latch ,</l>
       <l n="28">That entrance gave beneath a roof of thatch .</l>
       <l n="29">Companion of his solitary ways ,</l>
       <l n="30">Purveyor of his feasts on holidays ,</l>
       <l n="31">On him this melancholy man bestowed</l>

       <l n="36">With folded , patient hands , as he was used ,</l>
       <l n="37">And dreamily before his half-closed sight</l>

       <l n="39">Beside him , motionless , the drowsy bird</l>
       <l n="40">Dreamed of the chase , and in his slumber heard</l>
       <l n="41">The sudden , scythe-like sweep of wings , that dare</l>
       <l n="42">The headlong plunge thro ’ eddying gulfs of air ,</l>
       <l n="43">Then , starting broad awake upon his perch ,</l>
       <l n="44">Tinkled his bells , like mass-bells in a church ,</l>
       <l n="45">And , looking at his master , seemed to say ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="47">Ser Federigo thought not of the chase ;</l>

       <l n="50">In the leaf-shadows of the trellises ,</l>
       <l n="51">Herself , yet not herself ; a lovely child</l>
       <l n="52">With flowing tresses , and eyes wide and wild ,</l>
       <l n="53">Coming undaunted up the garden walk ,</l>
       <l n="54">And looking not at him , but at the hawk .</l>
       <l n="55">“ Beautiful falcon ! ” said he , “ would that I</l>

       <l n="57">The voice was hers , and made strange echoes start</l>
       <l n="58">Through all the haunted chambers of his heart ,</l>
       <l n="59">As an aeolian harp through gusty doors</l>
       <l n="60">Of some old ruin its wild music pours .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="61">“ Who is thy mother , my fair boy ? ” he said ,</l>

       <l n="67">So he spake on ; and Federigo heard</l>

       <l n="75">Then , waking from his pleasant reveries</l>
       <l n="76">He took the little boy upon his knees ,</l>

       <l n="3">“ No man shall look upon my face and live . ”</l>
       <l n="4">And as he read , he prayed that God would give</l>
       <l n="5">His faithful servant grace with mortal eye</l>
       <l n="6">To look upon His face and yet not die .</l>
      </lg>

       <l n="7">Then fell a sudden shadow on the page ,</l>
       <l n="8">And , lifting up his eyes , grown dim with age</l>
       <l n="9">He saw the Angel of Death before him stand ,</l>
       <l n="10">Holding a naked sword in his right hand .</l>
       <l n="11">Rabbi Ben Levi was a righteous man ,</l>
       <l n="12">Yet through his veins a chill of terror ran .</l>
       <l n="13">With trembling voice he said , “ What wilt thou here ? ”</l>
       <l n="14">The angel answered , “ Lo ! the time draws near</l>
       <l n="15">When thou must die ; yet first , by God 's decree ,</l>
       <l n="16">Whate'er thou askest shall be granted thee . ”</l>
       <l n="17">Replied the Rabbi , “ Let these living eyes</l>
       <l n="18">First look upon my place in Paradise . ”</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="19">Then said the Angel , “ Come with me and look . ”</l>
       <l n="20">Rabbi Ben Levi closed the sacred book ,</l>
       <l n="21">And rising , and uplifting his gray head ,</l>
       <l n="22">“ Give me thy sword , ” he to the Angel said ,</l>
       <l n="23">“ Lest thou shouldst fall upon me by the way . ”</l>
       <l n="24">The angel smiled and hastened to obey ,</l>
       <l n="25">Then led him forth to the Celestial Town ,</l>
       <l n="26">And set him on the wall , whence , gazing down ,</l>
       <l n="27">Rabbi Ben Levi , with his living eyes ,</l>

       <l n="32">Of something there unknown , which men call death .</l>
       <l n="33">Meanwhile the Angel stayed without and cried ,</l>
       <l n="34">“ Come back ! ” To which the Rabbi 's voice replied ,</l>
       <l n="35">“ No ! in the name of God , whom I adore ,</l>

       <l n="50">Among the sons of men . ” And while he paused</l>
       <l n="51">He heard the awful mandate of the Lord</l>
       <l n="52">Resounding through the air , “ Give back the sword ! ”</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="53">The Rabbi bowed his head in silent prayer ;</l>

       <l n="58">Thou wilt perform the bidding of the Lord . ”</l>
       <l n="59">The Angel took the sword again , and swore ,</l>
       <l n="60">And walks on earth unseen forevermore .</l>

       <l n="5">On St. John 's eve , at vespers , proudly sat</l>

       <l n="8">Repeated , like a burden or refrain ,</l>

       <l n="1">In the heroic days when Ferdinand</l>

       <l n="5">In a great castle near Valladolid ,</l>
       <l n="6">Moated and high and by fair woodlands hid ,</l>
       <l n="7">There dwelt as from the chronicles we learn ,</l>
       <l n="8">An old Hidalgo proud and taciturn ,</l>

       <l n="13">Unless , perchance , our eyes can see therein</l>
       <l n="14">The martyrdom triumphant o'er the sin ;</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="17">This sombre man counted each day as lost</l>
       <l n="18">On which his feet no sacred threshold crossed ;</l>
       <l n="19">And when he chanced the passing Host to meet ,</l>
       <l n="20">He knelt and prayed devoutly in the street ;</l>
       <l n="21">Oft he confessed ; and with each mutinous thought ,</l>
       <l n="22">As with wild beasts at Ephesus , he fought .</l>
       <l n="23">In deep contrition scourged himself in Lent ,</l>
       <l n="24">Walked in processions , with his head down bent ,</l>
       <l n="25">At plays of Corpus Christi oft was seen ,</l>
       <l n="26">And on Palm Sunday bore his bough of green .</l>
       <l n="27">His sole diversion was to hunt the boar</l>
       <l n="28">Through tangled thickets of the forest hoar ,</l>
       <l n="29">Or with his jingling mules to hurry down</l>
       <l n="30">To some grand bull-fight in the neighboring town ,</l>
       <l n="31">Or in the crowd with lighted taper stand ,</l>
       <l n="32">When Jews were burned , or banished from the land .</l>
       <l n="33">Then stirred within him a tumultuous joy ;</l>
       <l n="34">The demon whose delight is to destroy</l>
       <l n="35">Shook him , and shouted with a trumpet tone ,</l>

       <l n="37">And now , in that old castle in the wood ,</l>
       <l n="38">His daughters , in the dawn of womanhood ,</l>

       <l n="40">Resplendent with their bloom the forest shade ,</l>
       <l n="41">Reminding him of their dead mother 's face ,</l>
       <l n="42">When first she came into that gloomy place ,—</l>
       <l n="43">A memory in his heart as dim and sweet</l>
       <l n="44">As moonlight in a solitary street ,</l>
       <l n="45">Where the same rays , that lift the sea , are thrown</l>
       <l n="46">Lovely but powerless upon walls of stone .</l>
       <l n="47">These two fair daughters of a mother dead</l>
       <l n="48">Were all the dream had left him as it fled .</l>

       <l n="55">With dark surmises of a hidden crime ,</l>
       <l n="56">Made life itself a death before its time .</l>
       <l n="57">Jealous , suspicious , with no sense of shame ,</l>

       <l n="59">With velvet slippers , noiseless on the floors ,</l>
       <l n="60">He glided softly through half-open doors ;</l>
       <l n="61">Now in the room , and now upon the stair ,</l>
       <l n="62">He stood beside them ere they were aware ;</l>
       <l n="63">He listened in the passage when they talked ,</l>
       <l n="64">He watched them from the casement when they walked ,</l>
       <l n="65">He saw the gypsy haunt the river 's side ,</l>
       <l n="66">He saw the monk among the cork-trees glide ;</l>
       <l n="67">And , tortured by the mystery and the doubt</l>
       <l n="68">Of some dark secret , past his finding out ,</l>
       <l n="69">Baffled he paused ; then reassured again</l>
       <l n="70">Pursued the flying phantom of his brain .</l>
       <l n="71">He watched them even when they knelt in church ;</l>
       <l n="72">And then , descending lower in his search ,</l>
       <l n="73">Questioned the servants , and with eager eyes</l>
       <l n="74">Listened incredulous to their replies ;</l>
       <l n="75">The gypsy ? none had seen her in the wood !</l>
       <l n="76">The monk ? a mendicant in search of food !</l>

       <l n="209">That year in Killingworth the Autumn came</l>

       <l n="1">The hour was late ; the fire burned low ,</l>

       <l n="1">A cold , uninterrupted rain ,</l>

       <l n="4">A sea of mist that overflowed</l>

      <head>THE BELL OF ATRI</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">At Atri in Abruzzo , a small town</l>
       <l n="2">Of ancient Roman date , but scant renown ,</l>
       <l n="3">One of those little places that have run</l>
       <l n="4">Half up the hill , beneath a blazing sun ,</l>
       <l n="5">And then sat down to rest , as if to say ,</l>
       <l n="6">“ I climb no farther upward , come what may , ” —</l>
       <l n="7">The Re Giovanni , now unknown to fame ,</l>
       <l n="8">So many monarchs since have borne the name ,</l>
       <l n="9">Had a great bell hung in the market-place</l>
       <l n="10">Beneath a roof , projecting some small space ,</l>
       <l n="11">By way of shelter from the sun and rain .</l>
       <l n="12">Then rode he through the streets with all his train ,</l>
       <l n="13">And , with the blast of trumpets loud and long ,</l>
       <l n="14">Made proclamation , that whenever wrong</l>
       <l n="15">Was done to any man , he should but ring</l>
       <l n="16">The great bell in the square , and he , the King ,</l>
       <l n="17">Would cause the Syndic to decide thereon .</l>
       <l n="18">Such was the proclamation of King John .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="19">How swift the happy days in Atri sped ,</l>
       <l n="20">What wrongs were righted , need not here be said .</l>
       <l n="21">Suffice it that , as all things must decay ,</l>
       <l n="22">The hempen rope at length was worn away ,</l>
       <l n="23">Unravelled at the end , and , strand by strand ,</l>
       <l n="24">Loosened and wasted in the ringer 's hand ,</l>
       <l n="25">Till one , who noted this in passing by ,</l>
       <l n="26">Mended the rope with braids of briony ,</l>
       <l n="27">So that the leaves and tendrils of the vine</l>
       <l n="28">Hung like a votive garland at a shrine .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="29">By chance it happened that in Atri dwelt</l>
       <l n="30">A knight , with spur on heel and sword in belt ,</l>
       <l n="31">Who loved to hunt the wild-boar in the woods ,</l>
       <l n="32">Who loved his falcons with their crimson hoods ,</l>
       <l n="33">Who loved his hounds and horses , and all sports</l>
       <l n="34">And prodigalities of camps and courts ;—</l>
       <l n="35">Loved , or had loved them ; for at last , grown old ,</l>
       <l n="36">His only passion was the love of gold .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="37">He sold his horses , sold his hawks and hounds ,</l>
       <l n="38">Rented his vineyards and his garden-grounds ,</l>
       <l n="39">Kept but one steed , his favorite steed of all ,</l>
       <l n="40">To starve and shiver in a naked stall ,</l>
       <l n="41">And day by day sat brooding in his chair ,</l>
       <l n="42">Devising plans how best to hoard and spare .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="43">At length he said : “ What is the use or need</l>
       <l n="44">To keep at my own cost this lazy steed ,</l>
       <l n="45">Eating his head off in my stables here ,</l>
       <l n="46">When rents are low and provender is dear ?</l>
       <l n="47">Let him go feed upon the public ways ;</l>
       <l n="48">I want him only for the holidays . ”</l>
       <l n="49">So the old steed was turned into the heat</l>
       <l n="50">Of the long , lonely , silent , shadeless street ;</l>
       <l n="51">And wandered in suburban lanes forlorn ,</l>
       <l n="52">Barked at by dogs , and torn by brier and thorn .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="53">One afternoon , as in that sultry clime</l>
       <l n="54">It is the custom in the summer time ,</l>
       <l n="55">With bolted doors and window-shutters closed ,</l>
       <l n="56">The inhabitants of Atri slept or dozed ;</l>
       <l n="57">When suddenly upon their senses fell</l>
       <l n="58">The loud alarum of the accusing bell !</l>
       <l n="59">The Syndic started from his deep repose ,</l>
       <l n="60">Turned on his couch , and listened , and then rose</l>
       <l n="61">And donned his robes , and with reluctant pace</l>
       <l n="62">Went panting forth into the market-place ,</l>
       <l n="63">Where the great bell upon its cross-beam swung</l>
       <l n="64">Reiterating with persistent tongue ,</l>
       <l n="65">In half-articulate jargon , the old song :</l>
       <l n="66">“ Some one hath done a wrong , hath done a wrong ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="67">But ere he reached the belfry 's light arcade</l>
       <l n="68">He saw , or thought he saw , beneath its shade ,</l>
       <l n="69">No shape of human form of woman born ,</l>
       <l n="70">But a poor steed dejected and forlorn ,</l>
       <l n="71">Who with uplifted head and eager eye</l>
       <l n="72">Was tugging at the vines of briony .</l>
       <l n="73">“ Domeneddio ! ” cried the Syndie straight ,</l>

       <l n="24">Eyes full of laughter , neck and shoulders bare ,</l>
       <l n="25">A thin slip of a girl , like a new moon ,</l>
       <l n="26">Sure to be rounded into beauty soon ,</l>
       <l n="27">A creature men would worship and adore ,</l>

       <l n="37">And with uncommon feelings of delight</l>
       <l n="38">The Earl of Halifax beheld the sight .</l>
       <l n="39">Not so Dame Stavers , for he heard her say</l>
       <l n="40">These words , or thought he did , as plain as day :</l>

       <l n="42">About the town half dressed , and looking so ! ”</l>
       <l n="43">At which the gypsy laughed , and straight replied :</l>

       <l n="1">Olger the Dane and Desiderio ,</l>
       <l n="2">King of the Lombards , on a lofty tower</l>
       <l n="3">Stood gazing northward o'er the rolling plains ,</l>
       <l n="4">League after league of harvests , to the foot</l>
       <l n="5">Of the snow-crested Alps , and saw approach</l>
       <l n="6">A mighty army , thronging all the roads</l>
       <l n="7">That led into the city . And the King</l>
       <l n="8">Said unto Olger , who had passed his youth</l>
       <l n="9">As hostage at the court of France , and knew</l>
       <l n="10">The Emperor 's form and face “ Is Charlemagne</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="12">And still the innumerable multitude</l>

       <l n="15">Is coming in the midst of all these knights ! ”</l>
       <l n="16">And Olger answered slowly : “ No ; not yet ;</l>
       <l n="17">He will not come so soon . ” Then much disturbed</l>
       <l n="18">King Desiderio asked : “ What shall we do ,</l>
       <l n="19">if he approach with a still greater army ! ”</l>
       <l n="20">And Olger answered : “ When he shall appear ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="28">And then appeared in panoply complete</l>

       <l n="31">And Desiderio could no more endure</l>
       <l n="32">The light of day , nor yet encounter death ,</l>
       <l n="33">But sobbed aloud and said : “ Let us go down</l>

       <l n="35">Far from the sight and anger of a foe</l>
       <l n="36">So terrible as this ! ” And Olger said :</l>

       <l n="45">A light more terrible than any darkness ;</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="47">His helmet was of iron , and his gloves</l>

       <l n="49">And tassets were of iron , and his shield .</l>
       <l n="50">In his left hand he held an iron spear ,</l>
       <l n="51">In his right hand his sword invincible .</l>
       <l n="52">The horse he rode on had the strength of iron ,</l>

       <l n="54">Beside him and behind him , his whole host ,</l>
       <l n="55">Were armed with iron , and their hearts within them</l>
       <l n="56">Were stronger than the armor that they wore .</l>
       <l n="57">The fields and all the roads were filled with iron ,</l>
       <l n="58">And points of iron glistened in the sun</l>
       <l n="59">And shed a terror through the city streets .</l>

       <l n="60">This at a single glance Olger the Dane</l>

       <l n="104">But when he to the lady 's presence came</l>
       <l n="105">He knelt down at her feet , until she laid</l>
       <l n="106">Her hand upon him , like a naked blade ,</l>
       <l n="107">And whispered in his ear : “ Arise , Sir Knight ,</l>

       <l n="109">And there he lingered till the crowing cock ,</l>
       <l n="110">The Alectryon of the farmyard and the flock ,</l>
       <l n="111">Sang his aubade with lusty voice and clear ,</l>
       <l n="112">To tell the sleeping world that dawn was near .</l>
       <l n="113">And then they parted ; but at parting , lo !</l>
       <l n="114">They saw the palace courtyard white with snow ,</l>
       <l n="115">And , placid as a nun , the moon on high</l>
       <l n="116">Gazing from cloudy cloisters of the sky .</l>
       <l n="117">“ Alas ! ” he said , “ how hide the fatal line</l>
       <l n="118">Of footprints leading from thy door to mine ,</l>

       <l n="121">That night the Emperor , sleepless with the cares</l>

       <l n="123">Had risen before the dawn , and musing gazed</l>
       <l n="124">Into the silent night , as one amazed</l>
       <l n="125">To see the calm that reigned o'er all supreme ,</l>
       <l n="126">When his own reign was but a troubled dream .</l>
       <l n="127">The moon lit up the gables capped with snow ,</l>
       <l n="128">And the white roofs , and half the court below ,</l>
       <l n="129">And he beheld a form , that seemed to cower</l>

       <l n="131">A woman , who upon her shoulders bore</l>

       <l n="7">This they discussed in various mood ;</l>

       <l n="10">As of a bowstring snapped in air ;</l>
       <l n="11">And the Musician with a bound</l>
       <l n="12">Sprang up in terror from his chair ,</l>

       <l n="21">By the uncertain light beguiled ,</l>

       <l n="61">World-wide apart , and yet akin ,</l>
       <l n="62">As showing that the human heart</l>
       <l n="63">Beats on forever as of old ,</l>
       <l n="64">As well beneath the snow-white fold</l>
       <l n="65">Of Quaker kerchief , as within</l>

        <l n="2">In the old country the twilight is longer ; but here in the forest</l>
        <l n="3">Suddenly comes the dark , with hardly a pause in its coming ,</l>
        <l n="4">Hardly a moment between the two lights , the day and the lamplight ;</l>

        <l n="6">Thus spake Elizabeth Haddon at nightfall to Hannah the housemaid ,</l>
        <l n="7">As in the farm-house kitchen , that served for kitchen and parlor ,</l>
        <l n="8">By the window she sat with her work , and looked on a landscape</l>
        <l n="9">White as the great white sheet that Peter saw in his vision ,</l>
        <l n="10">By the four corners let down and descending out of the heavens .</l>
        <l n="11">Covered with snow were the forests of pine , and the fields and the meadows .</l>
        <l n="12">Nothing was dark but the sky , and the distant Delaware flowing</l>
        <l n="13">Down from its native hills , a peaceful and bountiful river .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="3">
        <l n="14">Then with a smile on her lips made answer Hannah the housemaid :</l>
        <l n="15">“ Beautiful winter ! yea , the winter is beautiful , surely ,</l>
        <l n="16">If one could only walk like a fly with one 's feet on the ceiling .</l>
        <l n="17">But the great Delaware River is not like the Thames , as we saw it</l>
        <l n="18">Out of our upper windows in Rotherhithe Street in the Borough ,</l>
        <l n="19">Crowded with masts and sails of vessels coming and going ;</l>
        <l n="20">Here there is nothing but pines , with patches of snow on their branches .</l>
        <l n="21">There is snow in the air , and see ! it is falling already ;</l>
        <l n="22">All the roads will be blocked , and I pity Joseph to-morrow ,</l>
        <l n="23">Breaking his way through the drifts , with his sled and oxen ; and then , too ,</l>
        <l n="24">How in all the world shall we get to Meeting on First-Day ? ”</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="4">
        <l n="25">But Elizabeth checked her , and answered , mildly reproving :</l>
        <l n="26">“ Surely the Lord will provide ; for unto the snow he sayeth ,</l>
        <l n="27">Be thou on the earth , the good Lord sayeth ; he is it</l>
        <l n="28">Giveth snow like wool , like ashes scatters the hoar-frost . ”</l>
        <l n="29">So she folded her work and laid it away in her basket .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="5">
        <l n="30">Meanwhile Hannah the housemaid had closed and fastened the shutters ,</l>
        <l n="31">Spread the cloth , and lighted the lamp on the table , and placed there</l>
        <l n="32">Plates and cups from the dresser , the brown rye loaf , and the butter</l>
        <l n="33">Fresh from the dairy , and then , protecting her hand with a holder ,</l>
        <l n="34">Took from the crane in the chimney the steaming and simmering kettle ,</l>
        <l n="35">Poised it aloft in the air , and filled up the earthen teapot ,</l>
        <l n="36">Made in Delft , and adorned with quaint and wonderful figures .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="6">
        <l n="37">Then Elizabeth said , “ Lo ! Joseph is long on his errand .</l>
        <l n="38">I have sent him away with a hamper of food and of clothing</l>
        <l n="39">For the poor in the village . A good lad and cheerful is Joseph ;</l>

       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="7">
        <l n="41">Thus in praise of her servant she spake , and Hannah the housemaid</l>
        <l n="42">Laughed with her eyes , as she listened , but governed her tongue , and was silent ,</l>
        <l n="43">While her mistress went on : “ The house is far from the village ;</l>
        <l n="44">We should be lonely here , were it not for Friends that in passing</l>
        <l n="45">Sometimes tarry o'ernight , and make us glad by their coming . ”</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="8">
        <l n="46">Thereupon answered Hannah the housemaid , the thrifty , the frugal :</l>
        <l n="47">“ Yea , they come and they tarry , as if thy house were a tavern ;</l>
        <l n="48">Open to all are its doors , and they come and go like the pigeons</l>
        <l n="49">In and out of the holes of the pigeon-house over the hayloft ,</l>
        <l n="50">Cooing and smoothing their feathers and basking themselves in the sunshine . ”</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="9">
        <l n="51">But in meekness of spirit , and calmly , Elizabeth answered :</l>
        <l n="52">“ All I have is the Lord 's , not mine to give or withhold it ;</l>
        <l n="53">I but distribute his gifts to the poor , and to those of his people</l>
        <l n="54">Who in journeyings often surrender their lives to his service .</l>
        <l n="55">His , not mine , are the gifts , and only so far can I make them</l>
        <l n="56">Mine , as in giving I add my heart to whatever is given .</l>
        <l n="57">Therefore my excellent father first built this house in the clearing ;</l>
        <l n="58">Though he came not himself , I came ; for the Lord was my guidance ,</l>
        <l n="59">Leading me here for this service . We must not grudge , then , to others</l>
        <l n="60">Ever the cup of cold water , or crumbs that fall from our table . ”</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="10">
        <l n="61">Thus rebuked , for a season was silent the penitent housemaid ;</l>

      <head>TOWER OF PROMETHEUS ON MOUNT CAUCASUS</head>
      <head>PROMETHEUS . I hear the trumpet of Alectryon Proclaim the dawn . The stars begin to fade , And all the heavens are full of prophecies And evil auguries . Blood-red last night I saw great Kronos rise ; the crescent moon Sank through the mist , as if it were the scythe His parricidal hand had flung far down The western steeps . O ye Immortal Gods , What evil are ye plotting and contriving ?</head>
       <l n="1">( HERMES and PANDORA at the threshold . )</l>
     </lg>
     <p>PANDORA . I cannot cross the threshold . An unseen And icy hand repels me . These blank walls Oppress me with their weight !</p>
     <p>PROMETHEUS . Powerful ye are , But not omnipotent . Ye cannot fight Against Necessity . The Fates control you , As they do us , and so far we are equals !</p>
     <p>PANDORA . Motionless , passionless , companionless , He sits there muttering in his beard . His voice Is like a river flowing underground !</p>
     <p>HERMES . Prometheus , hail !</p>
     <p>PROMETHEUS . Who calls me ?</p>
     <p>HERMES . It is I. Dost thou not know me ?</p>
     <p>PROMETHEUS . By thy winged cap And winged heels I know thee . Thou art Hermes , Captain of thieves ! Hast thou again been stealing The heifers of Admetus in the sweet Meadows of asphodel ? or Hera 's girdle ? Or the earth-shaking trident of Poseidon ?</p>
     <p>HERMES . And thou , Prometheus ; say , hast thou again Been stealing fire from Helios ’ chariot-wheels To light thy furnaces ?</p>
     <p>PROMETHEUS . Why comest thou hither So early in the dawn ?</p>
     <p>HERMES . The Immortal Gods Know naught of late or early . Zeus himself The omnipotent hath sent me .</p>
     <p>PROMETHEUS . For what purpose ?</p>
     <p>HERMES . To bring this maiden to thee .</p>
     <p>PROMETHEUS . I mistrust The Gods and all their gifts . If they have sent her It is for no good purpose .</p>
     <p>HERMES . What disaster Could she bring on thy house , who is a woman ?</p>
     <p>PROMETHEUS . The Gods are not my friends , nor am I theirs . Whatever comes from them , though in a shape As beautiful as this , is evil only . Who art thou ?</p>
     <p>PANDORA . One who , though to thee unknown , Yet knoweth thee .</p>
     <p>PROMETHEUS . How shouldst thou know me , woman ?</p>
     <p>PANDORA . Who knoweth not Prometheus the humane ?</p>
     <p>PROMETHEUS . Prometheus the unfortunate ; to whom Both Gods and men have shown themselves ungrateful . When every spark was quenched on every hearth Throughout the earth , I brought to man the fire And all its ministrations . My reward Hath been the rock and vulture .</p>
     <p>HERMES . But the Gods At last relent and pardon .</p>
     <p>PROMETHEUS . They relent not ; They pardon not ; they are implacable , Revengeful , unforgiving !</p>
     <p>HERMES . As a pledge Of reconciliation they have sent to thee This divine being , to be thy companion , And bring into thy melancholy house The sunshine and the fragrance of her youth .</p>
     <p>PROMETHEUS . I need them not . I have within myself All that my heart desires ; the ideal beauty Which the creative faculty of mind Fashions and follows in a thousand shapes More lovely than the real . My own thoughts Are my companions ; my designs and labors And aspirations are my only friends .</p>
     <p>HERMES . Decide not rashly . The decision made Can never be recalled . The Gods implore not , Plead not , solicit not ; they only offer Choice and occasion , which once being passed Return no more . Dost thou accept the gift ?</p>
     <p>PROMETHEUS . No gift of theirs , in whatsoever shape It comes to me , with whatsoever charm To fascinate my sense , will I receive . Leave me .</p>
     <p>PANDORA . Let us go hence . I will not stay .</p>
     <p>HERMES . We leave thee to thy vacant dreams , and all The silence and the solitude of thought , The endless bitterness of unbelief , The loneliness of existence without love .</p>
     <p>CHORUS OF THE FATES</p>
     <p>CLOTHO . How the Titan , the defiant , The self-centred , self-reliant , Wrapped in visions and illusions , Robs himself of life 's best gifts ! Till by all the storm-winds shaken , By the blast of fate o'ertaken , Hopeless , helpless , and forsaken , In the mists of his confusions To the reefs of doom he drifts !</p>
     <p>LACHESIS . Sorely tried and sorely tempted , From no agonies exempted , In the penance of his trial , And the discipline of pain ; Often by illusions cheated , Often baffled and defeated In the tasks to be completed , He , by toil and self-denial , To the highest shall attain .</p>
     <p>ATROPOS . Tempt no more the noble schemer ; Bear unto some idle dreamer This new toy and fascination , This new dalliance and delight ! To the garden where reposes Epimetheus crowned with roses , To the door that never closes Upon pleasure and temptation , Bring this vision of the night !</p>

     <p>PANDORA . No Goddess am I , nor of heavenly birth , But a mere woman fashioned out of clay And mortal as the rest .</p>
     <p>EPIMETHEUS . Thy face is fair ; There is a wonder in thine azure eyes That fascinates me . Thy whole presence seems A soft desire , a breathing thought of love . Say , would thy star like Merope 's grow dim If thou shouldst wed beneath thee ?</p>
     <p>PANDORA . Ask me not ; I cannot answer thee . I only know The Gods have sent me hither .</p>
     <p>EPIMETHEUS . I believe , And thus believing am most fortunate . It was not Hermes led thee here , but Eros , And swifter than his arrows were thine eyes In wounding me . There was no moment 's space Between my seeing thee and loving thee . O , what a telltale face thou hast ! Again I see the wonder in thy tender eyes .</p>
     <p>PANDORA . They do but answer to the love in thine , Yet secretly I wonder thou shouldst love me . Thou knowest me not .</p>
     <p>EPIMETHEUS . Perhaps I know thee better Than had I known thee longer . Yet it seems That I have always known thee , and but now Have found thee . Ah , I have been waiting long .</p>
     <p>PANDORA . How beautiful is this house ! The atmosphere Breathes rest and comfort , and the many chambers Seem full of welcomes .</p>
     <p>EPIMETHEUS . They not only seem , But truly are . This dwelling and its master Belong to thee .</p>
     <p>PANDORA . Here let me stay forever ! There is a spell upon me .</p>
     <p>EPIMETHEUS . Thou thyself Art the enchantress , and I feel thy power Envelop me , and wrap my soul and sense In an Elysian dream .</p>
     <p>PANDORA , O , let me stay . How beautiful are all things round about me , Multiplied by the mirrors on the walls ! What treasures hast thou here ! Yon oaken chest , Carven with figures and embossed with gold , Is wonderful to look upon ! What choice And precious things dost thou keep hidden in it ?</p>
     <p>EPIMETHEUS . I know not . ‘ T is a mystery .</p>
     <p>PANDORA . Hast thou never Lifted the lid ?</p>
     <p>EPIMETHEUS . The oracle forbids . Safely concealed there from all mortal eyes Forever sleeps the secret of the Gods . Seek not to know what they have hidden from thee , Till they themselves reveal it .</p>
     <p>PANDORA . As thou wilt .</p>
     <p>EPIMETHEUS . Let us go forth from this mysterious place . The garden walks are pleasant at this hour ; The nightingales among the sheltering boughs Of populous and many-nested trees Shall teach me how to woo thee , and shall tell me By what resistless charms or incantations They won their mates .</p>

      <head>IN THE GARDEN</head>
      <head>EPIMETHEUS . Yon snow-white cloud that sails sublime in ether Is but the sovereign Zeus , who like a swan Flies to fair-ankled Leda !</head>
      <head>PANDORA . Or perchance Ixion 's cloud , the shadowy shape of Hera , That bore the Centaurs .</head>

     <p>CHORUS OF BIRDS . Gently swaying to and fro , Rocked by all the winds that blow , Bright with sunshine from above Dark with shadow from below , Beak to beak and breast to breast In the cradle of their nest , Lie the fledglings of our love .</p>
     <p>ECHO . Love ! love !</p>
     <p>EPIMETHEUS . Hark ! listen ! Hear how sweetly overhead The feathered flute-players pipe their songs of love , And echo answers , love and only love .</p>
     <p>CHORUS OF BIRDS . Every flutter of the wing , Every note of song we sing , Every murmur , every tone , Is of love and love alone .</p>
     <p>ECHO . Love alone !</p>
     <p>EPIMETHEUS . Who would not love , if loving she might be Changed like Callisto to a star in heaven ?</p>
     <p>PANDORA . Ah , who would love , if loving she might be Like Semele consumed and burnt to ashes ?</p>
     <p>EPIMETHEUS . Whence knowest thou these stories ?</p>
     <p>PANDORA . Hermes taught me ; He told me all the history of the Gods .</p>
     <p>CHORUS OF REEDS . Evermore a sound shall be In the reeds of Arcady , Evermore a low lament Of unrest and discontent , As the story is retold Of the nymph so coy and cold , Who with frightened feet outran The pursuing steps of Pan .</p>
     <p>EPIMETHEUS . The pipe of Pan out of these reeds is made , And when he plays upon it to the shepherds They pity him , so mournful is the sound . Be thou not coy and cold as Syrinx was .</p>
     <p>PANDORA . Nor thou as Pan be rude and mannerless .</p>

     <p>PROMETHEUS . Whom the Gods would destroy they first make mad .</p>
     <p>EPIMETHEUS . Shall I refuse the gifts they send to me ?</p>
     <p>PROMETHEUS . Reject all gifts that come from higher powers .</p>
     <p>EPIMETHEUS . Such gifts as this are not to be rejected .</p>
     <p>PROMETHEUS . Make not thyself the slave of any woman .</p>
     <p>EPIMETHEUS . Make not thyself the judge of any man .</p>
     <p>PROMETHEUS . I judge thee not ; for thou art more than man ; Thou art descended from Titanic race , And hast a Titan 's strength , and faculties That make thee godlike ; and thou sittest here Like Heracles spinning Omphale 's flax , And beaten with her sandals .</p>
     <p>EPIMETHEUS . O my brother ! Thou drivest me to madness with thy taunts .</p>
     <p>PROMETHEUS . And me thou drivest to madness with thy follies . Come with me to my tower on Caucasus : See there my forges in the roaring caverns , Beneficent to man , and taste the joy That springs from labor . Read with me the stars , And learn the virtues that lie hidden in plants , And all things that are useful .</p>
     <p>EPIMETHEU5 . O my brother ! I am not as thou art . Thou dost inherit Our father 's strength , and I our mother 's weakness : The softness of the Oceanides , The yielding nature that cannot resist .</p>
     <p>PROMETHEUS . Because thou wilt not .</p>
     <p>EPIMETHEUS . Nay ; because I cannot .</p>
     <p>PROMETHEUS . Assert thyself ; rise up to thy full height ; Shake from thy soul these dreams effeminate , These passions born of indolence and ease . Resolve , and thou art free . But breathe the air Of mountains , and their unapproachable summits Will lift thee to the level of themselves .</p>
     <p>EPIMETHEUS . The roar of forests and of waterfalls , The rushing of a mighty wind , with loud And undistinguishable voices calling , Are in my ear !</p>
     <p>PROMETHEUS . O , listen and obey .</p>
     <p>EPIMETHEUS . Thou leadest me as a child , I follow thee .</p>

      <head>THE HOUSE OF EPIMETHEUS</head>
      <head>PANDORA . Left to myself I wander as I will , And as my fancy leads me , through this house , Nor could I ask a dwelling more complete Were I indeed the Goddess that he deems me . No mansion of Olympus , framed to be The habitation of the Immortal Gods , Can be more beautiful . And this is mine And more than this , the love wherewith he crowns me . As if impelled by powers invisible And irresistible , my steps return Unto this spacious hall . All corridors And passages lead hither , and all doors But open into it . Yon mysterious chest Attracts and fascinates me . Would I knew What there lies hidden ! But the oracle Forbids . Ah me ! The secret then is safe . So would it be if it were in my keeping . A crowd of shadowy faces from the mirrors That line these walls are watching me . I dare not Lift up the lid . A hundred times the act Would be repeated , and the secret seen By twice a hundred incorporeal eyes .</head>

     <p>PANDORA . Why didst thou return ? Eternal absence would have been to me The greatest punishment . To be left alone And face to face with my own crime , had been Just retribution . Upon me , ye Gods , Let all your vengeance fall !</p>

Even now in passing through the garden walks Upon the ground I saw a fallen nest Ruined and full of rain ; and over me Beheld the uncomplaining birds already Busy in building a new habitation .</p>
     <p>PANDORA . Auspicious omen !</p>
     <p>EPIMETHEUS . May the Eumenides Put out their torches and behold us not , And fling away their whips of scorpions And touch us not .</p>

     <p>THE BROKEN OAR Once upon Iceland 's solitary strand A poet wandered with his book and pen , Seeking some final word , some sweet Amen , Wherewith to close the volume in his hand . The billows rolled and plunged upon the sand , The circling sea-gulls swept beyond his ken , And from the parting cloud-rack now and then Flashed the red sunset over sea and land . Then by the billows at his feet was tossed A broken oar ; and carved thereon he read , “ Oft was I weary , when I toiled at thee ” ; And like a man , who findeth what was lost , He wrote the words , then lifted up his head , And flung his useless pen into the sea .</p>

      <head>CHRISTUS : A MYSTERY</head>
      <head>INTROITUS</head>
       <l n="1">The ANGEL bearing the PROPHET HABAKKUK through the air .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>PROPHET . Why dost thou bear me aloft , O Angel of God , on thy pinions O'er realms and dominions ? Softly I float as a cloud In air , for thy right hand upholds me , Thy garment enfolds me !</p>
     <p>ANGEL . Lo ! as I passed on my way In the harvest-field I beheld thee , When no man compelled thee , Bearing with thine own hands This food to the famishing reapers , A flock without keepers !</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">The fragrant sheaves of the wheat</l>
       <l n="2">Made the air above them sweet ;</l>
       <l n="3">Sweeter and more divine</l>
       <l n="4">Was the scent of the scattered grain ,</l>
       <l n="5">That the reaper 's hand let fall</l>
       <l n="6">To be gathered again</l>
       <l n="7">By the hand of the gleaner !</l>
       <l n="8">Sweetest , divinest of all ,</l>
       <l n="9">Was the humble deed of thine ,</l>
       <l n="10">And the meekness of thy demeanor !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>PROPHET . Angel of Light , I cannot gainsay thee , I can but obey thee !</p>
     <p>ANGEL . Beautiful was it in the lord 's sight , To behold his Prophet Feeding those that toil , The tillers of the soil . But why should the reapers eat of it And not the Prophet of Zion In the den of the lion ? The Prophet should feed the Prophet ! Therefore I thee have uplifted , And bear thee aloft by the hair Of thy head , like a cloud that is drifted Through the vast unknown of the air ! Five days hath the Prophet been lying In Babylon , in the den Of the lions , death-defying , Defying hunger and thirst ; But the worst Is the mockery of men ! Alas ! how full of fear Is the fate of Prophet and Seer ! Forevermore , forevermore , It shall be as it hath been heretofore ; The age in which they live Will not forgive The splendor of the everlasting light , That makes their foreheads bright , Nor the sublime Fore-running of their time !</p>
     <p>PROPHET . Oh tell me , for thou knowest , Wherefore and by what grace , Have I , who am least and lowest , Been chosen to this place , To this exalted part ?</p>
     <p>ANGEL . Because thou art The Struggler ; and from thy youth Thy humble and patient life Hath been a strife And battle for the Truth ; Nor hast thou paused nor halted , Nor ever in thy pride Turned from the poor aside , But with deed and word and pen Hast served thy fellow-men ; Therefore art thou exalted !</p>
     <p>PROPHET . By thine arrow 's light Thou goest onward through the night , And by the clear Sheen of thy glittering spear ! When will our journey end ?</p>
     <p>ANGEL . Lo , it is ended ! Yon silver gleam Is the Euphrates ’ stream . Let us descend Into the city splendid , Into the City of Gold !</p>
     <p>PROPHET . Behold ! As if the stars had fallen from their places Into the firmament below , The streets , the gardens , and the vacant spaces With light are all aglow ; And hark ! As we draw near , What sound is it I hear Ascending through the dark ?</p>
     <p>ANGEL . The tumultuous noise of the nations , Their rejoicings and lamentations , The pleadings of their prayer , The groans of their despair , The cry of their imprecations , Their wrath , their love , their hate !</p>
     <p>PROPHET . Surely the world doth wait The coming of its Redeemer !</p>
     <p>ANGEL . Awake from thy sleep , O dreamer ? The hour is near , though late ; Awake ! write the vision sublime , The vision , that is for a time , Though it tarry , wait ; it is nigh ; In the end it will speak and not lie .</p>

     <p>JOHN . I indeed baptize you with water Unto repentance ; but He , That cometh after me , Is mightier than I and higher ; The latchet of whose shoes I an not worthy to unloose ; He shall baptize you with fire , And with the Holy Ghost ! Whose fan is in his hand ; He will purge to the uttermost His floor , and garner his wheat , But will burn the chaff in the brand And fire of unquenchable heat ! Repent ! repent ! repent !</p>

     <p>IN THE CORNFIELDS</p>
     <p>PHILIP . Onward through leagues of sun-illumined corn , As if through parted seas , the pathway runs , And crowned with sunshine as the Prince of Peace Walks the beloved Master , leading us , As Moses led our fathers in old times Out of the land of bondage ! We have found Him of whom Moses and the Prophets wrote , Jesus of Nazareth , the Son of Joseph .</p>
     <p>NATHANAEL . Can any good come out of Nazareth ? Can this be the Messiah ?</p>
     <p>PHILIP . Come and see .</p>
     <p>NATHANAEL . The summer sun grows hot : I am anhungered . How cheerily the Sabbath-breaking quail Pipes in the corn , and bids us to his Feast Of Wheat Sheaves ! How the bearded , ripening ears Toss in the roofless temple of the air ; As if the unseen hand of some High-Priest Waved them before Mount Tabor as an altar ! It were no harm , if we should pluck and eat .</p>
     <p>PHILIP . How wonderful it is to walk abroad With the Good Master ! Since the miracle He wrought at Cana , at the marriage feast , His fame hath gone abroad through all the land , And when we come to Nazareth , thou shalt see How his own people will receive their Prophet , And hail him as Messiah ! See , he turns And looks at thee .</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Behold an Israelite In whom there is no guile .</p>
     <p>NATHANAEL . Whence knowest thou me ?</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Before that Philip called thee , when thou wast Under the fig-tree , I beheld thee .</p>
     <p>NATHANAEL . Rabbi ! Thou art the Son of God , thou art the King Of Israel !</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Because I said I saw thee Under the fig-tree , before Philip called thee , Believest thou ? Thou shalt see greater things . Hereafter thou shalt see the heavens unclosed , The angels of God ascending and descending Upon the Son of Man !</p>

     <p>CHRISTUS . Have ye not read What David did when he anhungered was , And all they that were with him ? How he entered Into the house of God , and ate the shew-bread , Which was not lawful , saving for the priests ? Have ye not read , how on the Sabbath-days The priests profane the Sabbath in the Temple , And yet are blameless ? But I say to you , One in this place is greater than the Temple ! And had ye known the meaning of the words , I will have mercy and not sacrifice , The guiltless ye would not condemn . The Sabbath Was made for man , and not man for the Sabbath .</p>
     <p>Passes on with the disciples .</p>
     <p>PHARISEES . This is , alas ! some poor demoniac Wandering about the fields , and uttering His unintelligible blasphemies Among the common people , who receive As prophecies the words they comprehend not ! Deluded folk ! The incomprehensible Alone excites their wonder . There is none So visionary , or so void of sense , But he will find a crowd to follow him !</p>

     <p>A PRIEST . Fifty years Have I been Priest here in the Synagogue , And never have I seen so young a man Sit in the Teacher 's seat !</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Behold , to-day This scripture is fulfilled . One is appointed And hath been sent to them that mourn in Zion , To give them beauty for ashes , and the oil Of joy for mourning ! They shall build again The old waste-places ; and again raise up The former desolations , and repair The cities that are wasted ! As a bridegroom Decketh himself with ornaments ; as a bride Adorneth herself with jewels , so the Lord Hath clothed me with the robe of righteousness !</p>

     <p>CHRISTUS . No man is a Prophet In his own country , and among his kin . In his own house no Prophet is accepted . I say to you , in the land of Israel Were many widows in Elijah 's day , When for three years and more the heavens were shut , And a great famine was throughout the land ; But unto no one was Elijah sent Save to Sarepta , to a city of Sidon , And to a woman there that was a widow . And many lepers were then in the land Of Israel , in the time of Eliseus The Prophet , and yet none of them was cleansed , Save Naaman the Syrian !</p>

     <p>A PHARISEE . We want no Prophets here ! Let him be driven From Synagogue and city ! Let him go And prophesy to the Samaritans !</p>
     <p>AN ELDER . The world is changed . We Elders are as nothing ! We are but yesterdays , that have no part Or portion in to-day ! Dry leaves that rustle , That make a little sound , and then are dust !</p>

      <head>THE SEA OF GALILEE .</head>
       <l n="1">PETER and ANDREW mending their nets .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>PETER . Never was such a marvellous draught of fishes Heard of in Galilee ! The market-places Both of Bethsaida and Capernaum Are full of them ! Yet we had toiled all night And taken nothing , when the Master said : Launch out into the deep , and cast your nets ; And doing this , we caught such multitudes , Our nets like spiders ’ webs were snapped asunder , And with the draught we filled two ships so full That they began to sink . Then I knelt down Amazed , and said : O Lord , depart from me , I am a sinful man . And he made answer : Simon , fear not ; henceforth thou shalt catch men ! What was the meaning of those words ?</p>
     <p>ANDREW . I know not . But here is Philip , come from Nazareth . He hath been with the Master . Tell us , Philip , What tidings dost thou bring ?</p>
     <p>PHILIP . Most wonderful ! As we drew near to Nain , out of the gate Upon a bier was carried the dead body Of a young man , his mother 's only son , And she a widow , who with lamentation Bewailed her loss , and the much people with her ; And when the Master saw her he was filled With pity ; and he said to her : Weep not And came and touched the bier , and they that bare it Stood still ; and then he said : Young man , arise ! And he that had been dead sat up , and soon Began to speak ; and he delivered him Unto his mother . And there came a fear On all the people , and they glorified The Lord , and said , rejoicing : A great Prophet Is risen up among us ! and the Lord Hath visited his people !</p>
     <p>PETER . A great Prophet ? Ay , greater than a Prophet : greater even Than John the Baptist !</p>
     <p>PHILIP . Yet the Nazarenes Rejected him .</p>
     <p>PETER . The Nazarenes are dogs ! As natural brute beasts , they growl at things They do not understand ; and they shall perish , Utterly perish in their own corruption . The Nazarenes are dogs !</p>
     <p>PHILIP . They drave him forth Out of their Synagogue , out of their city , And would have cast him down a precipice , But , passing through the midst of them , he vanished Out of their hands .</p>
     <p>PETER . Wells are they without water , Clouds carried with a tempest , unto whom The mist of darkness is reserved forever .</p>
     <p>PHILIP . Behold , he cometh . There is one man with him I am amazed to see !</p>
     <p>ANDREW . What man is that ?</p>
     <p>PHILIP . Judas Iscariot ; he that cometh last , Girt with a leathern apron . No one knoweth His history ; but the rumor of him is He had an unclean spirit in his youth . It hath not left him yet .</p>

      <head>THE TOWER OF MAGDALA</head>
      <head>MARY MAGDALENE . Companionless , unsatisfied , forlorn , I sit here in this lonely tower , and look Upon the lake below me , and the hills That swoon with heat , and see as in a vision All my past life unroll itself before me . The princes and the merchants come to me , Merchants of Tyre and Princes of Damascus . And pass , and disappear , and are no more ; But leave behind their merchandise and jewels , Their perfumes , and their gold , and their disgust . I loathe them , and the very memory of them Is unto me as thought of food to one Cloyed with the luscious figs of Dalmanutha ! What if hereafter , in the long hereafter Of endless joy or pain , or joy in pain , It were my punishment to be with them Grown hideous and decrepit in their sins , And hear them say : Thou that hast brought us here , Be unto us as thou hast been of old ! I look upon this raiment that I wear , These silks , and these embroideries , and they seem Only as cerements wrapped about my limbs ! I look upon these rings thick set with pearls , And emerald and amethyst and jasper , And they are burning coals upon my flesh ! This serpent on my wrist becomes alive ! Away , thou viper ! and away , ye garlands , Whose odors bring the swift remembrance back Of the unhallowed revels in these chambers ! But yesterday ,— and yet it seems to me Something remote , like a pathetic song Sung long ago by minstrels in the street ,— But yesterday , as from this tower I gazed , Over the olive and the walnut trees Upon the lake and the white ships , and wondered Whither and whence they steered , and who was in them , A fisher 's boat drew near the landing-place Under the oleanders , and the people Came up from it , and passed beneath the tower , Close under me . In front of them , as leader , Walked one of royal aspect , clothed in white , Who lifted up his eyes , and looked at me , And all at once the air seemed filled and living With a mysterious power , that streamed from him , And overflowed me with an atmosphere Of light and love . As one entranced I stood , And when I woke again , lo ! he was gone ; So that I said : Perhaps it is a dream . But from that very hour the seven demons That had their habitation in this body Which men call beautiful , departed from me !</head>

They are like children sitting in the markets , And calling unto one another , saying : We have piped unto you , and ye have not danced We have mourned unto you , and ye have not wept ! This say I unto you , for John the Baptist Came neither eating bread nor drinking wine Ye say he hath a devil . The Son of Man Eating and drinking cometh , and ye say : Behold a gluttonous man , and a wine-bibber ; Behold a friend of publicans and sinners !</p>

       <l n="3">So silently behind him ?</l>
     </lg>
     <p>SIMON . It is Mary , Who dwelleth in the Tower of Magdala .</p>
     <p>THE GUEST . See , how she kneels there weeping , and her tears Fall on his feet ; and her long , golden hair Waves to and fro and wipes them dry again . And now she kisses them , and from a box Of alabaster is anointing them With precious ointment , filling all the house With its sweet odor !</p>

     <p>CHRISTUS . A certain creditor Had once two debtors ; and the one of them Owed him five hundred pence ; the other , fifty . They having naught to pay withal , he frankly Forgave them both . Now tell me which of them Will love him most ?</p>
     <p>SIMON . He , I suppose to whom He most forgave .</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Yea , thou hast rightly judged . Seest thou this woman ? When thine house I entered , Thou gavest me no water for my feet , But she hath washed them with her tears , and wiped them With her own hair . Thou gavest me no kiss ; This woman hath not ceased , since I came in , To kiss my feet . My head with oil didst thou Anoint not ; but this woman hath anointed My feet with ointment . Hence I say to thee , Her sins , which have been many , are forgiven , For she loved much .</p>
     <p>THE GUESTS . Oh , who , then , is this man That pardoneth also sins without atonement ?</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Woman , thy faith hath saved thee ! Go in peace !</p>

     <p>HEROD . I recognize thy features , but what mean These torn and faded garments ? On thy road Have demons crowded thee , and rubbed against thee , And given thee weary knees ? A cup of wine !</p>
     <p>MANAHEM . The Essenians drink no wine .</p>
     <p>HEROD . What wilt thou , then ?</p>
     <p>MANAHEM . Nothing .</p>
     <p>HEROD . Not even a cup of water ?</p>
     <p>MANAHEM . Nothing . Why hast thou sent for me ?</p>
     <p>HEROD . Dost thou remember One day when I , a schoolboy in the streets Of the great city , met thee on my way To school , and thou didst say to me : Hereafter Thou shalt be king ?</p>
     <p>MANAHEM . Yea , I remember it .</p>
     <p>HEROD . Thinking thou didst not know me , I replied : I am of humble birth ; whereat thou , smiling , Didst smite me with thy hand , and saidst again : Thou shalt be king ; and let the friendly blows That Manahem hath given thee on this day Remind thee of the fickleness of fortune .</p>
     <p>MANAHEM . What more ?</p>
     <p>HEROD . No more .</p>
     <p>MANAHEM . Yea , for I said to thee : It shall be well with thee if thou love justice And clemency towards thy fellow-men . Hast thou done this , O King ?</p>
     <p>HEROD . Go , ask my people .</p>
     <p>MANAHEM . And then , foreseeing all thy life , I added : But these thou wilt forget ; and at the end Of life the Lord will punish thee .</p>
     <p>HEROD . The end ! When will that come ? For this I sent to thee . How long shall I still reign ? Thou dost not answer ! Speak ! shall I reign ten years ?</p>
     <p>MANAHEM . Thou shalt reign twenty , Nay , thirty years . I cannot name the end .</p>
     <p>HEROD . Thirty ? I thank thee , good Essenian ! This is my birthday , and a happier one Was never mine . We hold a banquet here . See , yonder are Herodias and her daughter .</p>

In my father 's time Matthias Margaloth was put to death For tearing the golden eagle from its station Above the Temple Gate ,— a slighter crime Than John is guilty of .

     <p>DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS . Thou hast sworn it .</p>
     <p>HEROD . For mine oath 's sake , then . Send unto the prison ; Let him die quickly . Oh , accursed oath !</p>
     <p>MANAHEM . Bid me depart , O King !</p>
     <p>HEROD . Good Manahem , Give me thy hand . I love the Essenians . He 's gone and hears me not ! The guests are dumb , Awaiting the pale face , the silent witness .

      <p>IV</p>
     <p>NICODEMUS AT NIGHT</p>
     <p>NICODEMUS . The streets are silent . The dark houses seem Like sepulchres , in which the sleepers lie Wrapped in their shrouds , and for the moment dead . The lamps are all extinguished ; only one Burns steadily , and from the door its light Lies like a shining gate across the street . He waits for me . Ah , should this be at last The long-expected Christ ! I see him there Sitting alone , deep-buried in his thought , As if the weight of all the world were resting Upon him , and thus bowed him down . O Rabbi , We know thou art a Teacher come from God , For no man can perform the miracles Thou dost perform , except the Lord be with him . Thou art a Prophet , sent here to proclaim The Kingdom of the Lord . Behold in me A Ruler of the Jews , who long have waited The coming of that kingdom . Tell me of it .</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Verily , verily I say unto thee , Except a man be born again , he cannot Behold the Kingdom of God !</p>
     <p>NICODEMUS . Be born again ? How can a man be born when he is old ? Say , can he enter for a second time Into his mother 's womb , and so be born ?</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Verily I say unto thee , except A man be born of water and the spirit , He cannot enter into the Kingdom of God . For that which of the flesh is born , is flesh ; And that which of the spirit is born , is spirit .</p>
     <p>NICODEMUS . We Israelites from the Primeval Man Adam Ahelion derive our bodies ; Our souls are breathings of the Holy Ghost . No more than this we know , or need to know .</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Then marvel not , that I said unto thee Ye must be born again .</p>
     <p>NICODEMUS . The mystery Of birth and death we cannot comprehend .</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . The wind bloweth where it listeth , and we hear The sound thereof , but know not whence it cometh , Nor whither it goeth . So is every one Born of the spirit !</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">NICODEMUS , aside .</l>
       <l n="2">How can these things be ?</l>
       <l n="3">He seems to speak of some vague realm of shadows ,</l>
       <l n="4">Some unsubstantial kingdom of the air !</l>
       <l n="5">It is not this the Jews are waiting for ,</l>
       <l n="6">Nor can this be the Christ , the Son of David ,</l>
       <l n="7">Who shall deliver us !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Art thou a master Of Israel , and knowest not these things ? We speak that we do know , and testify That we have seen , and ye will not receive Our witness . If I tell you earthly things , And ye believe not , how shall ye believe , If I should tell you of things heavenly ? And no man hath ascended up to heaven , But he alone that first came down from heaven , Even the Son of Man which is in heaven !</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">NICODEMUS , aside .</l>
       <l n="2">This is a dreamer of dreams ; a visionary ,</l>
       <l n="3">Whose brain is overtasked , until he deems</l>
       <l n="4">The unseen world to be a thing substantial ,</l>
       <l n="5">And this we live in , an unreal vision !</l>
       <l n="6">And yet his presence fascinates and fills me</l>
       <l n="7">With wonder , and I feel myself exalted</l>
       <l n="8">Into a higher region , and become</l>
       <l n="9">Myself in part a dreamer of his dreams ,</l>
       <l n="10">A seer of his visions !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>CHRISTUS . And as Moses Uplifted the serpent in the wilderness , So must the Son of Man be lifted up ; That whosoever shall believe in Him Shall perish not , but have eternal life . He that believes in Him is not condemned ; He that believes not , is condemned already .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">NICODEMUS , aside .</l>
       <l n="2">He speaketh like a Prophet of the Lord !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>CHRISTUS . This is the condemnation ; that the light Is come into the world , and men loved darkness Rather than light , because their deeds are evil !</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">NICODEMUS , aside .</l>
       <l n="2">Of me he speaketh ! He reproveth me ,</l>
       <l n="3">Because I come by night to question him !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>CHRISTUS . For every one that doeth evil deeds Hateth the light , nor cometh to the light Lest he should be reproved .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">NICODEMUS , aside .</l>
       <l n="2">Alas , how truly</l>
       <l n="3">He readeth what is passing in my heart !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>CHRISTUS . But he that doeth truth comes to the light , So that his deeds may be made manifest , That they are wrought in God .</p>
     <p>NICODEMUS . Alas ! alas !</p>

      <head>BLIND BARTIMEUS</head>
      <head>BARTIMEUS . Be not impatient , Chilion ; it is pleasant To sit here in the shadow of the walls Under the palms , and hear the hum of bees , And rumor of voices passing to and fro , And drowsy bells of caravans on their way To Sidon or Damascus . This is still The City of Palms , and yet the walls thou seest Are not the old walls , not the walls where Rahab Hid the two spies , and let them down by cords Out of the window , when the gates were shut , And it was dark . Those walls were overthrown When Joshua 's army shouted , and the priests Blew with their seven trumpets .</head>
       <l n="1">CHILION .</l>
       <l n="2">When was that ?</l>
     </lg>
     <p>BARTIMEUS . O my sweet rose of Jericho , I know not Hundreds of years ago . And over there Beyond the river , the great prophet Elijah Was taken by a whirlwind up to heaven In chariot of fire , with fiery horses . That is the plain of Moab ; and beyond it Rise the blue summits of Mount Abarim , Nebo and Pisgah and Peor , where Moses Died , whom the Lord knew face to face ? and whom He buried in a valley , and no man Knows of his sepulchre unto this day .</p>
     <p>CHILION . Would thou couldst see these places , as I see them .</p>
     <p>BARTIMEUS . I have not seen a glimmer of the light Since thou wast born . I never saw thy face , And yet I seem to see it ; and one day Perhaps shall see it ; for there is a Prophet In Galilee , the Messiah , the Son of David , Who heals the blind , if I could only find him . I hear the sound of many feet approaching , And voices , like the murmur of a crowd ! What seest thou ?</p>
     <p>CHILION . A young man clad in white Is coming through the gateway , and a crowd Of people follow .</p>
     <p>BARTIMEUS . Can it be the Prophet ! O neighbors , tell me who it is that passes ?</p>
     <p>ONE OF THE CROWD . Jesus of Nazareth .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">BARTIMEUS , crying .</l>
       <l n="2">O Son of David !</l>
       <l n="3">Have mercy on me !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>MANY OP THE CROWD . Peace . Blind Bartimeus ! Do not disturb the Master .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">BARTIMEUS , crying more vehemently .</l>
       <l n="2">Son of David ,</l>
       <l n="3">Have mercy on me !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>ONE OF THE CROWD . See , the Master stops . Be of good comfort ; rise , He calleth thee !</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">BARTIMEUS , casting away his cloak .</l>
       <l n="2">Chilion ! good neighbors ! lead me on .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>CHRISTUS . What wilt thou That I should do to thee ?</p>
     <p>BARTIMEUS . Good Lord ! my sight — That I receive my sight !</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Receive thy sight ! Thy faith hath made thee whole !</p>
     <p>THE CROWD . He sees again !</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS passes on , The crowd gathers round BARTIMEUS .</p>
     <p>BARTIMEUS . I see again ; but sight bewilders me ! Like a remembered dream , familiar things Come back to me . I see the tender sky Above me , see the trees , the city walls , And the old gateway , through whose echoing arch I groped so many years ; and you , my neighbors ; But know you by your friendly voices only . How beautiful the world is ! and how wide ! Oh , I am miles away , if I but look ! Where art thou , Chilion ?</p>
     <p>CHILION . Father , I am here .</p>
     <p>BARTIMEUS . Oh let me gaze upon thy face , dear child ! For I have only seen thee with my hands ! How beautiful thou art ! I should have known thee ; Thou hast her eyes whom we shall see hereafter ! O God of Abraham ! Elion ! Adonai ! Who art thyself a Father , pardon me If for a moment I have thee postponed To the affections and the thoughts of earth , Thee , and the adoration that I owe thee , When by thy power alone these darkened eyes Have been unsealed again to see thy light !</p>

      <head>JACOB 'S WELL</head>
      <head>A SAMARITAN WOMAN . The sun is hot ; and the dry east-wind blowing Fills all the air with dust . The birds are silent ; Even the little fieldfares in the corn No longer twitter ; only the grasshoppers Sing their incessant song of sun and summer . I wonder who those strangers were I met Going into the city ? Galileans They seemed to me in speaking , when they asked The short way to the market-place . Perhaps They are fishermen from the lake ; or travellers , Looking to find the inn . And here is some one Sitting beside the well ; another stranger ; A Galilean also by his looks . What can so many Jews be doing here Together in Samaria ? Are they going Up to Jerusalem to the Passover ? Our Passover is better here at Sychem , For here is Ebal ; here is Gerizim , The mountain where our father Abraham Went up to offer Isaac ; here the tomb Of Joseph ,— for they brought his bones Egypt And buried them in this land , and it is holy .</head>
       <l n="1">CHRISTUS .</l>
       <l n="2">Give me to drink .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>SAMARITAN WOMAN . How can it be that thou , Being a Jew , askest to drink of me Which am a woman of Samaria ? You Jews despise us ; have no dealings with us ; Make us a byword ; call us in derision The silly folk of Sychar . Sir , how is it Thou askest drink of me ?</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . If thou hadst known The gift of God , and who it is that sayeth Give me to drink , thou wouldst have asked of Him ; He would have given thee the living water .</p>
     <p>SAMARITAN WOMAN . Sir , thou hast naught to draw with , and the well Is deep ! Whence hast thou living water ? Say , art thou greater than our father Jacob , Which gave this well to us , and drank thereof Himself , and all his children and his cattle ?</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Ah , whosoever drinketh of this water Shall thirst again ; but whosoever drinketh The water I shall give him shall not thirst Forevermore , for it shall be within him A well of living water , springing up Into life everlasting .</p>
     <p>SAMARITAN WOMAN . Every day I must go to and fro , in heat and cold , And I am weary . Give me of this water , That I may thirst not , nor come here to draw .</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Go call thy husband , woman , and come hither .</p>
     <p>SAMARITAN WOMAN . I have no husband , Sir .</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Thou hast well said I have no husband . Thou hast had five husbands ; And he whom now thou hast is not thy husband .</p>
     <p>SAMARITAN WOMAN . Surely thou art a Prophet , for thou readest The hidden things of life ! Our fathers worshipped Upon this mountain Gerizim ; and ye say The only place in which men ought to worship Is at Jerusalem .</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Believe me , woman , The hour is coming , when ye neither shall Upon this mount , nor at Jerusalem , Worship the Father ; for the hour is coming , And is now come , when the true worshippers Shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth ! The Father seeketh such to worship Him . God is a spirit ; and they that worship Him Must worship Him in spirit and in truth .</p>
     <p>SAMARITAN WOMAN . Master , I know that the Messiah cometh , Which is called Christ ; and he will tell us all things .</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . I that speak unto thee am He !</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">THE DISCIPLES , returning .</l>
       <l n="2">Behold ,</l>
       <l n="3">The Master sitting by the well , and talking</l>
       <l n="4">With a Samaritan woman ! With a woman</l>
       <l n="5">Of Sychar , the silly people , always boasting</l>
       <l n="6">Of their Mount Ebal , and Mount Gerizim ,</l>
       <l n="7">Their Everlasting Mountain , which they think</l>
       <l n="8">Higher and holier than our Mount Moriah !</l>
       <l n="9">Why , once upon the Feast of the New Moon ,</l>
       <l n="10">When our great Sanhedrim of Jerusalem</l>
       <l n="11">Had all its watch-fires kindled on the hills</l>
       <l n="12">To warn the distant villages , these people</l>
       <l n="13">Lighted up others to mislead the Jews ,</l>
       <l n="14">And make a mockery of their festival !</l>
       <l n="15">See , she has left the Master ; and is running</l>
       <l n="16">Back to the city !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>SAMARITAN WOMAN . Oh , come see a man Who hath told me all things that I ever did ! Say , is not this the Christ ?</p>
     <p>THE DISCIPLES . Lo , Master , here Is food , that we have brought thee from the city . We pray thee eat it .</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . I have food to eat Ye know not of .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">THE DISCIPLES , to each other .</l>
       <l n="2">Hath any man been here ,</l>
       <l n="3">And brought Him aught to eat , while we were gone ?</l>
     </lg>
     <p>CHRISTUS . The food I speak of is to do the will Of Him that sent me , and to finish his work . Do ye not say , Lo ! there are yet four months And cometh , harvest ? I say unto you , Lift up your eyes , and look upon the fields , For they are white already unto harvest !</p>

     <p>CHRISTUS . But who say ye I am ?</p>
     <p>PETER . Thou art the Christ ? Thou art the Son of God !</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Blessed art thou , Simon Barjona ! Flesh and blood hath not Revealed it unto thee , but even my Father , Which is in Heaven . And I say unto thee That thou art Peter ; and upon this rock I build my Church , and all the gates of Hell Shall not prevail against it . But take heed Ye tell no man that I am the Christ . For I must go up to Jerusalem , And suffer many things , and be rejected Of the Chief Priests , and of the Scribes and Elders , And must be crucified , and the third day Shall rise again !</p>
     <p>PETER . Be it far from thee , Lord ! This shall not be !</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Get thee behind me , Satan ! Thou savorest not the things that be of God , But those that be of men ! If any will Come after me , let him deny himself , And daily take his cross , and follow me . For whosoever will save his life shall lose it , And whosoever will lose his life shall find it . For wherein shall a man be profited If he shall gain the whole world , and shall lose Himself or be a castaway ?</p>

     <p>JOHN . See where He standeth Above us on the summit of the hill ! His face shines as the sun ! and all his raiment Exceeding white as snow , so as no fuller On earth can white them ! He is not alone ; There are two with him there ; two men of eld , Their white beards blowing on the mountain air , Are talking with him .</p>
     <p>JAMES . I am sore afraid !</p>
     <p>PETER . Who and whence are they ?</p>
     <p>JOHN . Moses and Elias !</p>
     <p>PETER . O Master ! it is good for us to be here ! If thou wilt , let us make three tabernacles ; For thee one , and for Moses and Elias !</p>
     <p>JOHN . Behold a bright cloud sailing in the sun ! It overshadows us . A golden mist Now hides them from us , and envelops us And all the mountains in a luminous shadow ! I see no more . The nearest rocks are hidden .</p>

      <head>THE YOUNG RULER</head>
      <head>CHRISTUS . Two men went up into the temple to pray . The one was a self-righteous Pharisee , The other a Publican . And the Pharisee Stood and prayed thus within himself : O God , I thank thee I am not as other men , Extortioners , unjust , adulterers , Or even as this Publican . I fast Twice in the week , and also I give tithes Of all that I possess ! The Publican , Standing afar off , would not lift so much Even as his eyes to heaven , but smote his breast , Saying : God be merciful to me a sinner ! I tell you that this man went to his house More justified than the other . Every one That doth exalt himself shall be abased , And he that humbleth himself shall be exalted !</head>

     </lg>
     <p>AN OLD JEW . Children , children ! What are ye doing here ? Why do ye crowd us ? It was such little vagabonds as you That followed Elisha , mucking him and crying : Go up , thou bald-head ! But the bears — the bears Came out of the wood , and tare them !</p>
     <p>A MOTHER . Speak not thus ! We brought them here , that He might lay his hands On them , and bless them .</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Suffer little children To come unto me , and forbid them not ; Of such is the kingdom of heaven ; and their angels Look always on my Father 's face .</p>
     <p>Takes them in his arms and blesses them .</p>

     <p>CHRISTUS . Why callest thou me good ? There is none good but one , and that is God . If thou wilt enter into life eternal , Keep the commandments .</p>
     <p>YOUNG RULER . Which of them ?</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Thou shalt not Commit adultery ; thou shalt not kill ; Thou shalt not steal ; thou shalt not bear false witness ; Honor thy father and thy mother ; and love Thy neighbor as thyself .</p>
     <p>YOUNG RULER . From my youth up All these things have I kept . What lack I yet ?</p>
     <p>JOHN . With what divine compassion in his eyes The Master looks upon this eager youth , As if he loved him !</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Wouldst thou perfect be , Sell all thou hast , and give it to the poor , And come , take up thy cross , and follow me , And thou shalt have thy treasure in the heavens .</p>
     <p>JOHN . Behold , how sorrowful he turns away !</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Children ! how hard it is for them that trust In riches to enter into the kingdom of God ! ‘ T is easier for a camel to go through A needle 's eye , than for the rich to enter The kingdom of God !</p>

     <p>CHRISTUS . With men this is indeed impossible , But unto God all things are possible !</p>

     <p>MARTHA . She sitteth idly at the Master 's feet . And troubles not herself with household cares . ‘ T is the old story . When a guest arrives She gives up all to be with him ; while I Must be the drudge , make ready the guest-chamber , Prepare the food , set everything in order , And see that naught is wanting in the house . She shows her love by words , and I by works .</p>
     <p>MARY . O Master ! when thou comest , it is always A Sabbath in the house . I cannot work ; I must sit at thy feet ; must see thee , hear thee ! I have a feeble , wayward , doubting heart , Incapable of endurance or great thoughts , Striving for something that it cannot reach , Baffled and disappointed , wounded , hungry ; And only when I hear thee am I happy , And only when I see thee am at peace ! Stronger than I , and wiser , and far better In every manner , is my sister Martha . Thou seest how well she orders everything To make thee welcome ; how she comes and goes , Careful and cumbered ever with much serving , While I but welcome thee with foolish words ! Whene'er thou speakest to me , I am happy ; When thou art silent , I am satisfied . Thy presence is enough . I ask no more . Only to be with thee , only to see thee , Sufficeth me . My heart is then at rest . I wonder I am worthy of so much .</p>
     <p>MARTHA . Lord , dost thou care not that my sister Mary Hath left me thus to wait on thee alone ? I pray thee , bid her help me .</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Martha , Martha , Careful and troubled about many things Art thou , and yet one thing alone is needful ! Thy sister Mary hath chosen that good part , Which never shall be taken away from her !</p>

     <p>PHARISEES . How opened he thine eyes ? What did he do ?</p>
     <p>THE BEGGAR . I have already told you . Ye did not hear : why would ye hear again ? Will ye be his disciples ?</p>
     <p>PHARISEES . God of Moses ! Are we demoniacs , are we halt or blind , Or palsy-stricken , or lepers , or the like , That we should join the Synagogue of Satan , And follow jugglers ? Thou art his disciple , But we are disciples of Moses ; and we know That God spake unto Moses ; but this fellow , We know not whence he is !</p>
     <p>THE BEGGAR . Why , herein is A marvellous thing ! Ye know not whence he is , Yet he hath opened mine eyes ! We know that God Heareth not sinners ; but if any man Doeth God 's will , and is his worshipper , Him doth he hear . Oh , since the world began It was not heard that any man hath opened The eyes of one that was born blind . If He Were not of God , surely he could do nothing !</p>
     <p>PHARISEES . Thou , who wast altogether born in sins And in iniquities , dost thou teach us ? Away with thee out of the holy places , Thou reprobate , thou beggar , thou blasphemer !</p>
     <p>THE BEGGAR is cast out .</p>

      <head>SIMON MAGUS AND HELEN OF TYRE</head>
       <l n="1">On the house-top at Endor . Night . A lighted lantern on a table .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>SIMON . Swift are the blessed Immortals to the mortal That perseveres ! So doth it stand recorded In the divine Chaldaean Oracles Of Zoroaster , once Ezekiel 's slave , Who in his native East betook himself To lonely meditation , and the writing On the dried skins of oxen the Twelve Books Of the Avesta and the Oracles ! Therefore I persevere ; and I have brought thee From the great city of Tyre , where men deride The things they comprehend not , to this plain Of Esdraelon , in the Hebrew tongue Called Armageddon , and this town of Endor , Where men believe ; where all the air is full Of marvellous traditions , and the Enchantress That summoned up the ghost of Samuel Is still remembered . Thou hast seen the land ; Is it not fair to look on ?</p>
     <p>HELEN . It is fair , Yet not so fair as Tyre .</p>
     <p>SIMON . Is not Mount Tabor As beautiful as Carmel by the Sea ?</p>
     <p>HELEN . It is too silent and too solitary ; I miss the tumult of the street ; the sounds Of traffic , and the going to and fro Of people in gay attire , with cloaks of purple , And gold and silver jewelry !</p>
     <p>SIMON . Inventions Of Abriman , the spirit of the dark , The Evil Spirit !</p>
     <p>HELEN . I regret the gossip Of friends and neighbors at the open door On summer nights .</p>
     <p>SIMON . An idle waste of time .</p>
     <p>HELEN . The singing and the dancing , the delight Of music and of motion . Woe is me , To give up all these pleasures , and to lead The life we lead !</p>
     <p>SIMON . Thou canst not raise thyself Up to the level of my higher thought , And though possessing thee , I still remain Apart from thee , and with thee , am alone In my high dreams .</p>
     <p>HELEN . Happier was I in Tyre . Oh , I remember how the gallant ships Came sailing in , with ivory , gold , and silver , And apes and peacocks ; and the singing sailors , And the gay captains with their silken dresses , Smelling of aloes , myrrh , and cinnamon !</p>
     <p>SIMON . But the dishonor , Helen ! Let the ships Of Tarshish howl for that !</p>
     <p>HELEN . And what dishonor ? Remember Rahab , and how she became The ancestress of the great Psalmist David ; And wherefore should not I , Helen of Tyre , Attain like honor ?</p>
     <p>SIMON . Thou art Helen of Tyre , And hast been Helen of Troy , and hast been Rahab , The Queen of Sheha , and Semiramis , And Sara of seven husbands , and Jezebel , And other women of the like allurements ; And now thou art Minerva , the first Aeon , The Mother of Angels !</p>
     <p>HELEN . And the concubine Of Simon the Magician ! Is it honor For one who has been all these noble dames , To tramp about the dirty villages And cities of Samaria with a juggler ? A charmer of serpents ?</p>
     <p>SIMON . He who knows himself Knows all things in himself . I have charmed thee , Thou beautiful asp : yet am I no magician , I am the Power of God , and the Beauty of God ! I am the Paraclete , the Comforter !</p>
     <p>HELEN . Illusions ! Thou deceiver , self-deceived ! Thou dost usurp the titles of another ; Thou art not what thou sayest .</p>
     <p>SIMON . Am I not ? Then feel my power .</p>
     <p>HELEN . Would I had ne'er left Tyre !</p>
     <p>He looks at her , and she sinks into a deep sleep .</p>
     <p>SIMON . Go , see it in thy dreams , fair unbeliever ! And leave me unto mine , if they be dreams , That take such shapes before me , that I see them ; These effable and ineffable impressions Of the mysterious world , that come to me From the elements of Fire and Earth and Water , And the all-nourishing Ether ! It is written , Look not on Nature , for her name is fatal ! Yet there are Principles , that make apparent The images of unapparent things , And the impression of vague characters And visions most divine appear in ether . So speak the Oracles ; then wherefore fatal ? I take this orange-bough , with its five leaves , Each equidistant on the upright stem ; And I project them on a plane below , In the circumference of a circle drawn About a centre where the stem is planted , And each still equidistant from the other , As if a thread of gossamer were drawn Down from each leaf , and fastened with a pin . Now if from these five points a line be traced To each alternate point , we shall obtain The Pentagram , or Solomon 's Pentangle , A charm against all witchcraft , and a sign , Which on the banner of Antiochus Drove back the fierce barbarians of the North , Demons esteemed , and gave the Syrian King The sacred name of Soter , or of Savior . Thus Nature works mysteriously with man ; And from the Eternal One , as from a centre , All things proceed , in fire , air , earth , and water , And all are subject to one law , which , broken Even in a single point , is broken in all ; Demons rush in , and chaos comes again . By this will I compel the stubborn spirits , That guard the treasures , hid in caverns deep On Gerizim , by Uzzi the High-Priest , The ark and holy vessels , to reveal Their secret unto me , and to restore These precious things to the Samaritans . A mist is rising from the plain below me , And as I look , the vapors shape themselves Into strange figures , as if unawares My lips had breathed the Tetragrammaton , And from their graves , o'er all the battlefields Of Armageddon , the long-buried captains Had started , with their thousands , and ten thousands , And rushed together to renew their wars , Powerless , and weaponless , and without a sound ! Wake , Helen , from thy sleep ! The air grows cold ; Let us go down .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">HELEN , awaking .</l>
       <l n="2">Oh , would I were at home !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>SIMON . Thou sayest that I usurp another 's titles . In youth I saw the Wise Men of the East , Magalath and Pangalath and Saracen , Who followed the bright star , but home returned For fear of Herod by another way . O shining worlds above me ! in what deep Recesses of your realms of mystery Lies hidden now that star ? and where are they That brought the gifts of frankincense and myrrh ?</p>
     <p>HELEN . The Nazarene still liveth .</p>
     <p>SIMON . We have heard His name in many towns , but have not seen Him . He flits before us ; tarries not ; is gone When we approach , like something unsubstantial , Made of the air , and fading into air . He is at Nazareth , He is at Nain , Or at the Lovely Village on the Lake , Or sailing on its waters .</p>
     <p>HELEN . So say those Who do not wish to find Him .</p>
     <p>SIMON . Can this be The King of Israel , whom the Wise Men worshipped ? Or does He fear to meet me ? It would seem so . We should soon learn which of us twain usurps The titles of the other , as thou sayest .</p>
     <p>They go down .</p>

     <p>THE MOTHER . Thy faith hath saved thee ! Ah , how true that is ! For I had faith ; and when the Master came Into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon , fleeing From those who sought to slay him , I went forth And cried unto Him , saying : Have mercy on me , O Lord , thou Son of David ! for my daughter Is grievously tormented with a devil . But he passed on , and answered not a word . And his disciples said , beseeching Him : Send her away ! She crieth after us ! And then the Master answered them and said : I am not sent but unto the lost sheep Of the House of Israel ! Then I worshipped Him , Saying : Lord help me ! And He answered me , It is not meet to take the children 's bread And cast it unto dogs ! Truth , Lord , I said ; And yet the dogs may eat the crumbs which fall From off their master 's table ; and he turned , And answered me ; and said to me : O woman , Great is thy faith ; then be it unto thee Even as thou wilt . And from that very hour Thou wast made whole , my darling ! my delight !</p>
     <p>THE DAUGHTER . There came upon my dark and troubled mind A calm , as when the tumult of the City Suddenly ceases , and I lie and hear The silver trumpets of the Temple blowing Their welcome to the Sabbath . Still I wonder , That one who was so far away from me And could not see me , by his thought alone Had power to heal me . Oh that I could see Him !</p>
     <p>THE MOTHER . Perhaps thou wilt ; for I have brought thee here To keep the holy Passover , and lay Thine offering of thanksgiving on the altar . Thou mayst both see and hear Him . Hark !</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">VOICES afar off .</l>
       <l n="2">Hosanna !</l>

     <p>VOICES . Blessed Is he that cometh in the name of the Lord ! Hosanna in the highest !</p>
     <p>OTHER VOICES . Who is this ?</p>
     <p>VOICES . Jesus of Nazareth !</p>
     <p>THE DAUGHTER . Mother , it is he !</p>

     <p>PHARISEES . Ye perceive That nothing we prevail . Behold , the world Is all gone after him !</p>
     <p>THE DAUGHTER . What majesty , What power is in that care-worn countenance ! What sweetness , what compassion ! I no longer Wonder that he hath healed me !</p>
     <p>VOICES . Peace in heaven , And glory in the highest !</p>
     <p>PHARISEES . Rabbi ! Rabbi ! Rebuke thy followers !</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Should they hold their peace The very stones beneath us would cry out !</p>
     <p>THE DAUGHTER . All hath passed by me like a dream of wonder ! But I have seen Him , and have heard his voice , And I am satisfied ! I ask no more !</p>

      <head>SOLOMON 'S PORCH</head>
      <head>GAMALIEL THE SCRIBE . When Rabban Simeon — upon whom be peace !— Taught in these Schools , he boasted that his pen Had written no word that he could call his own , But wholly and always had been consecrated To the transcribing of the Law and Prophets . He used to say , and never tired of saying , The world itself was built upon the Law . And ancient Hillel said , that whosoever Gains a good name gains something for himself , But he who gains a knowledge of the Law Gains everlasting life . And they spake truly . Great is the Written Law ; but greater still The Unwritten , the Traditions of the Elders , The lovely words of Levites , spoken first To Moses on the Mount , and handed down From mouth to mouth , in one unbroken sound And sequence of divine authority , The voice of God resounding through the ages .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The Written Law is water ; the Unwritten</l>

       <l n="6">I can remember , many years ago ,</l>
       <l n="7">A little bright-eyed school-boy , a mere stripling ,</l>
       <l n="8">Son of a Galilean carpenter ,</l>
       <l n="9">From Nazareth , I think , who came one day</l>
       <l n="10">And sat here in the Temple with the Scribes ,</l>
       <l n="11">Hearing us speak , and asking many questions ,</l>
       <l n="12">And we were all astonished at his quickness .</l>
       <l n="13">And when his mother came , and said : Behold</l>
       <l n="14">Thy father and I have sought thee , sorrowing ;</l>
       <l n="15">He looked as one astonished , and made answer ,</l>
       <l n="16">How is it that ye sought me ? Wist ye not</l>
       <l n="17">That I must be about my Father 's business ?</l>
       <l n="18">Often since then I see him here among us ,</l>
       <l n="19">Or dream I see him , with his upraised face</l>
       <l n="20">Intent and eager , and I often wonder</l>
       <l n="21">Unto what manner of manhood he hath grown !</l>
       <l n="22">Perhaps a poor mechanic like his father ,</l>
       <l n="23">Lost in his little Galilean village</l>
       <l n="24">And toiling at his craft , to die unknown</l>

     </lg>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Their works they do for to be seen of men . They make broad their phylacteries , and enlarge The borders of their garments , and they love The uppermost rooms at feasts , and the chief seats In Synagogues , and greetings in the markets , And to be called of all men Rabbi , Rabbi !</p>
     <p>GAMALIEL . It is that loud and turbulent Galilean , That came here at the Feast of Dedication , And stirred the people up to break the Law !</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Woe unto you , ye Scribes and Pharisees , Ye hypocrites ! for ye shut up the kingdom Of heaven , and neither go ye in yourselves Nor suffer them that are entering to go in !</p>
     <p>GAMALIEL . How eagerly the people throng and listen , As if his ribald words were words of wisdom !</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Woe unto you , ye Scribes and Pharisees , Ye hypocrites ! for ye devour the houses Of widows , and for pretence ye make long prayers ; Therefore shall ye receive the more damnation .</p>
     <p>GAMALIEL . This brawler is no Jew ,— he is a vile Samaritan , and hath an unclean spirit !</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Woe unto you , ye Scribes and Pharisees , Ye hypocrites ! ye compass sea and land To make one proselyte , and when he is made Ye make him twofold more the child of hell Than you yourselves are !</p>
     <p>GAMALIEL . O my father 's father ! Hillel of blessed memory , hear and judge !</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Woe unto you , ye Scribes and Pharisees , Ye hypocrites ! for ye pay tithe of mint , Of anise , and of cumin , and omit The weightier matters of the law of God , Judgment and faith and mercy ; and all these Ye ought to have done , nor leave undone the others !</p>
     <p>GAMALIEL . O Rabban Simeon ! how must thy bones Stir in their grave to hear such blasphemies !</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Woe unto you , ye Scribes , and Pharisees , Ye hypocrites ! for ye make clean and sweet The outside of the cup and of the platter , But they within are full of all excess !</p>
     <p>GAMALIEL . Patience of God ! canst thou endure so long ? Or art thou deaf , or gone upon a journey ?</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Woe unto you , ye Scribes and Pharisees , Ye hypocrites ! for ye are very like To whited sepulchres , which indeed appear Beautiful outwardly , but are within Filled full of dead men 's bones and all uncleanness !</p>
     <p>GAMALIEL . Am I awake ? Is this Jerusalem ? And are these Jews that throng and stare and listen ?</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Woe unto you , ye Scribes and Pharisees , Ye hypocrites ! because ye build the tombs Of prophets , and adorn the sepulchres Of righteous men , and say : if we had lived When lived our fathers , we would not have been Partakers with them in the blood of Prophets . So ye be witnesses unto yourselves , That ye are children of them that killed the Prophets ! Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers . I send unto you Prophets and Wise Men , And Scribes , and some ye crucify , and some Scourge in your Synagogues , and persecute From city to city ; that on you may come The righteous blood that hath been shed on earth , From the blood of righteous Abel to the blood Of Zacharias , son of Barachias , Ye slew between the Temple and the altar !</p>
     <p>GAMALIEL . Oh , had I here my subtle dialectician , My little Saul of Tarsus , the tent-maker , Whose wit is sharper than his needle 's point , He would delight to foil this noisy wrangler !</p>
     <p>CHRISTUS . Jerusalem ! Jerusalem ! O thou That killest the Prophets , and that stonest them Which are sent unto thee , how often would I Have gathered together thy children , as a hen Gathereth her chickens underneath her wing , And ye would not ! Behold , your house is left Unto you desolate !</p>

     <p>THE PALACE OF CAIAPHAS</p>
     <p>PHARISEES . What do we ? Clearly something must we do , For this man worketh many miracles .</p>
     <p>CAIAPHAS . I am informed that he is a mechanic ; A carpenter 's son ; a Galilean peasant , Keeping disreputable company .</p>
     <p>PHARISEES . The people say that here in Bethany He hath raised up a certain Lazarus , Who had been dead three days .</p>
     <p>CAIAPHAS . Impossible ! There is no resurrection of the dead ; This Lazarus should be taken , and put to death As an impostor . If this Galilean Would be content to stay in Galilee , And preach in country towns , I should not heed him . But when he comes up to Jerusalem Riding in triumph , as I am informed , And drives the money-changers from the Temple , That is another matter .</p>
     <p>PHARISEES . If we thus Let him alone , all will believe on him , And then the Romans come and take away Our place and nation .</p>
     <p>CAIAPHAS . Ye know nothing at all . Simon Ben Camith , my great predecessor , On whom be peace ! would have dealt presently With such a demagogue . I shall no less . The man must die . Do ye consider not It is expedient that one man should die , Not the whole nation perish ? What is death ? It differeth from sleep but in duration . We sleep and wake again ; an hour or two Later or earlier , and it matters not , And if we never wake it matters not ; When we are in our graves we are at peace , Nothing can wake us or disturb us more . There is no resurrection .</p>

      <head>JUDAS ISCARIOT . Lost ! Lost ! Forever lost ! I have betrayed The innocent blood ! O God ! if thou art love , Why didst thou leave me naked to the tempter ? Why didst thou not commission thy swift lightning To strike me dead ? or why did I not perish With those by Herod slain , the innocent children , Who went with playthings in their little hands Into the darkness of the other world , As if to bed ? Or wherefore was I born , If thou in thy foreknowledge didst perceive All that I am , and all that I must be ? I know I am not generous , am not gentle , Like other men ; but I have tried to be , And I have failed . I thought by following him I should grow like him ; but the unclean spirit That from my childhood up hath tortured me Hath been too cunning and too strong for me , Am I to blame for this ? Am I to blame Because I cannot love , and ne'er have known The love of woman or the love of children ? It is a curse and a fatality , A mark that hath been set upon my forehead , That none shall slay me , for it were a mercy That I were dead , or never had been born .</head>

A crown of thorns on that dishonored head ! Those hands that healed the sick now pierced with nails , Those feet that wandered homeless through the world Now crossed and bleeding , and at rest forever !

      <head>JOACHIM . The wind is rising ; it seizes and shakes The doors and window-blinds and makes Mysterious moanings in the halls ; The convent-chimneys seem almost The trumpets of some heavenly host , Setting its watch upon our walls ! Where it listeth , there it bloweth ; We hear the sound , but no man knoweth Whence it cometh or whither it goeth , And thus it is with the Holy Ghost . O breath of God ! O my delight In many a vigil of the night , Like the great voice in Patmos heard By John , the Evangelist of the Word , I hear thee behind me saying : Write In a book the things that thou hast seen , The things that are , and that have been , And the things that shall hereafter be !</head>

     <p>LUCIFER . Hasten ! hasten ! O ye spirits ! From its station drag the ponderous Cross of iron , that to mock us Is uplifted high in air !</p>
     <p>VOICES . Oh , we cannot ! For around it All the Saints and Guardian Angels Throng in legions to protect it ; They defeat us everywhere !</p>
     <p>THE BELLS . Laudo Deum verum ! Plebem voco ! Congrego clerum !</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . Lower ! lower ! Hover downward ! Seize the loud , vociferous bells , and Clashing , clanging to the pavement , Hurl them from their windy tower .</p>
     <p>VOICES . All thy thunders Here are harmless ! For these bells have been anointed , And baptized with holy water ! They defy our utmost power .</p>
     <p>THE BELLS . Defunctos ploro ! Pestem fugo ! Festa decoro !</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . Shake the casements ! Break the painted Panes , that flame with gold and crimson ; Scatter them like leaves of Autumn , Swept away before the blast !</p>

     <p>LUCIFER . Baffled ! baffled ! Inefficient , Craven spirits ! leave this labor Unto time , the great Destroyer ! Come away , ere night is gone !</p>

      <head>A chamber in a tower . PRINCE HENRY sitting alone , ill and restless . Midnight .</head>
      <head>PRINCE HENRY . I cannot sleep ! my fervid brain Calls up the vanished Past again , And throws its misty splendors deep Into the pallid realms of sleep ! A breath from that far-distant shore Comes freshening ever more and more , And wafts o'er intervening seas Sweet odors from the Hesperides ! A wind , that through the corridor Just stirs the curtain , and no more , And , touching the aolian strings , Faints with the burden that it brings ! Come back ! ye friendships long departed ! That like o'erflowing streamlets started , And now are dwindled , one by one , To stony channels in the sun ! Come back ! ye friends , whose lives are ended , Come back , with all that light attended , Which seemed to darken and decay When ye arose and went away !</head>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>LUCIFER . One who seeks A moment 's audience with the Prince .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . When came you in ?</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . A moment since . I found your study door unlocked , And thought you answered when I knocked .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . I did not hear you .</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . You heard the thunder ; It was loud enough to waken the dead . And it is not a matter of special wonder That , when God is walking overhead , You should not hear my feeble tread .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . What may your wish or purpose be ?</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . Nothing or everything , as it pleases Your Highness . You behold in me Only a travelling Physician ; One of the few who have a mission To cure incurable diseases , Or those that are called so .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Can you bring The dead to life ?</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . Yes ; very nearly . And , what is a wiser and better thing , Can keep the living from ever needing Such an unnatural , strange proceeding , By showing conclusively and clearly That death is a stupid blunder merely , And not a necessity of our lives . My being here is accidental ; The storm , that against your casement drives , In the little village below waylaid me . And there I heard , with a secret delight , Of your maladies physical and mental , Which neither astonished nor dismayed me . And I hastened hither , though late in the night , To proffer my aid !</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">PRINCE HENRY , ironically .</l>
       <l n="2">For this you came !</l>
       <l n="3">Ah , how can I ever hope to requite</l>
       <l n="4">This honor from one so erudite ?</l>
     </lg>
     <p>LUCIFER . The honor is mine , or will be when I have cured your disease .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . But not till then .</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . What is your illness ?</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . It has no name . A smouldering , dull , perpetual flame , As in a kiln , burns in my veins , Sending up vapors to the head ; My heart has become a dull lagoon , Which a kind of leprosy drinks and drains ; I am accounted as one who is dead , And , indeed , I think that I shall be soon .</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . And has Gordonius the Divine , In his famous Lily of Medicine ,— I see the book lies open before you ,— No remedy potent enough to restore you ?</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . None whatever !</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . The dead are dead , And their oracles dumb , when questioned Of the new diseases that human life Evolves in its progress , rank and rife . Consult the dead upon things that were , But the living only on things that are . Have you done this , by the appliance And aid of doctors ?</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Ay , whole schools Of doctors , with their learned rules ; But the case is quite beyond their science . Even the doctors of Salern Send me back word they can discern No cure for a malady like this , Save one which in its nature is Impossible and cannot be !</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . That sounds oracular !</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Unendurable !</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . What is their remedy ?</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . You shall see ; Writ in this scroll is the mystery .</p>

     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Purge with your nostrums and drugs infernal The spouts and gargoyles of these towers , Not me ! My faith is utterly gone In every power but the Power Supernal ! Pray tell ne , of what school are you ?</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . Both of the Old and of the New ! The school of Hermes Trismegistus , Who uttered his oracles sublime Before the Olympiads , in the dew Of the early dusk and dawn of time , The reign of dateless old Hephaestus ! As northward , from its Nubian springs , The Nile , forever new and old , Among the living and the dead , Its mighty mystic stream has rolled ; So , starting from its fountain-head Under the lotus-leaves of Isis , From the dead demigods of eld , Through long unbroken lines of kings Its course the sacred art has held , Unchecked , unchanged by man 's devices . This art the Arabian Geber taught , And in alembics , finely wrought , Distilling herbs and flowers , discovered The secret that so long had hovered Upon the misty verge of Truth , The Elixir of Perpetual Youth , Called Alcohol , in the Arab speech ! Like him , this wondrous lore I teach !</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . What ! an adept ?</p>
     <p>LUCIFFR . Nor less , nor more !</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . I am a reader of your books , A lover of that mystic lore ! With such a piercing glance it looks Into great Nature 's open eye , And sees within it trembling lie The portrait of the Deity ! And yet , alas ! with all my pains , The secret and the mystery Have baffled and eluded me , Unseen the grand result remains !</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">LUCIFER , showing a flask .</l>
       <l n="2">Behold it here ! this little flask</l>
       <l n="3">Contains the wonderful quintessence ,</l>
       <l n="4">The perfect flower and efflorescence ,</l>
       <l n="5">Of all the knowledge man can ask !</l>
       <l n="6">Hold it up thus against the light !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . How limpid , pure , and crystalline , How quick , and tremulous , and bright The little wavelets dance and shine , As were it the Water of Life in sooth !</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . It is ! It assuages every pain , Cures all disease , and gives again To age the swift delights of youth . Inhale its fragrance .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . It is sweet . A thousand different odors meet And mingle in its rare perfume , Such as the winds of summer waft At open windows through a room !</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . Will you not taste it ?</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Will one draught Suffice ?</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . If not , you can drink more .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Into this crystal goblet pour So much as safely I may drink ,</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">LUCIFER , pouring .</l>
       <l n="2">Let not the quantity alarm you ;</l>
       <l n="3">You may drink all ; it will not harm you .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . I am as one who on the brink Of a dark river stands and sees The waters flow , the landscape dim Around him waver , wheel , and swim , And , ere he plunges , stops to think Into what whirlpools he may sink ; One moment pauses , and no more , Then madly plunges from the shore ! Headlong into the mysteries Of life and death I boldly leap , Nor fear the fateful current 's sweep , Nor what in ambush lurks below ! For death is better than disease !</p>
     <p>An ANGEL with an aeolian harp hovers in the air .</p>
     <p>ANGEL . Woe ! woe ! eternal woe ! Not only the whispered prayer Of love , But the imprecations of hate , Reverberate For ever and ever through the air Above ! This fearful curse Shakes the great universe !</p>

With fiendish laughter , Hereafter , This false physician Will mock thee in thy perdition .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Speak ! speak ! Who says that I am ill ? I am not ill ! I am not weak ! The trance , the swoon , the dream , is o'er ! I feel the chill of death no more ! At length , I stand renewed in all my strength Beneath me I can feel The great earth stagger and reel , As if the feet of a descending God Upon its surface trod , And like a pebble it rolled beneath his heel ! This , O brave physician ! this Is thy great Palingenesis !</p>
     <p>Drinks again .</p>
     <p>THE ANGEL . Touch the goblet no more ! It will make thy heart sore To its very core ! Its perfume is the breath Of the Angel of Death , And the light that within it lies Is the flash of his evil eyes . Beware ! Oh , beware ! For sickness , sorrow , and care All are there !</p>

     </lg>
     <p>HUBERT . How sad the grand old castle looks ! O'erhead , the unmolested rooks Upon the turret 's windy top Sit , talking of the farmer 's crop Here in the court-yard springs the grass , So few are now the feet that pass ; The stately peacocks , bolder grown , Come hopping down the steps of stone , As if the castle were their own ; And I , the poor old seneschal , Haunt , like a ghost , the banquet-hall . Alas ! the merry guests no more Crowd through the hospitable door ; No eyes with youth and passion shine , No cheeks glow redder than the wine ; No song , no laugh , no jovial din Of drinking wassail to the pin ; But all is silent , sad , and drear , And now the only sounds I hear Are the hoarse rooks upon the walls , And horses stamping in their stalls !</p>
     <p>A horn sounds .</p>

       <l n="4">The heavy hinges of the gate ,</l>
       <l n="5">And , clattering loud , with iron clank ,</l>
       <l n="6">Down goes the sounding bridge of plank ,</l>
       <l n="7">As if it were in haste to greet</l>
       <l n="8">The pressure of a traveller 's feet !</l>

       <l n="9">Enter WALTER the Minnesinger .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>WALTER . How now , my friend ! This looks quite lonely ! No banner flying from the walls , No pages and no seneschals , No warders , and one porter only ! Is it you , Hubert ?</p>
     <p>HUBERT . Ah ! Master Walter !</p>
     <p>WALTER . Alas ! how forms and faces alter ! I did not know you . You look older ! Your hair has grown much grayer and thinner , And you stoop a little in the shoulder !</p>
     <p>HUBERT . Alack ! I am a poor old sinner , And , like these towers , begin to moulder ; And you have been absent many a year !</p>
     <p>WALTER . How is the Prince ?</p>
     <p>HUBERT . He is not here ; He has been ill : and now has fled .</p>
     <p>WALTER . Speak it out frankly : say he 's dead ! Is it not so ?</p>
     <p>HUBERT . No ; if you please , A strange , mysterious disease Fell on him with a sudden blight . Whole hours together he would stand Upon the terrace in a dream , Resting his head upon his hand , Best pleased when he was most alone , Like Saint John Nepomuck in stone , Looking down into a stream . In the Round Tower , night after night , He sat and bleared his eyes with books ; Until one morning we found him there Stretched on the floor , as if in a swoon He had fallen from his chair . We hardly recognized his sweet looks !</p>
     <p>WALTER . Poor Prince !</p>
     <p>HUBERT . I think he might have mended ; And he did mend ; but very soon The priests came flocking in , like rooks , With all their crosiers and their crooks , And so at last the matter ended .</p>
     <p>WALTER . How did it end ?</p>
     <p>HUBERT . Why , in Saint Rochus They made him stand and wait his doom ; And , as if he were condemned to the tomb , Began to mutter their hocus-pocus . First , the Mass for the Dead they chanted , Then three times laid upon his head A shovelful of churchyard clay , Saying to him , as he stood undaunted , “ This is a sign that thou art dead , So in thy heart be penitent ! ” And forth from the chapel door he went Into disgrace and banishment , Clothed in a cloak of hodden gray , And hearing a wallet , and a bell , Whose sound should be a perpetual knell To keep all travellers away .</p>
     <p>WALTER . Oh , horrible fate ! Outcast , rejected , As one with pestilence infected !</p>
     <p>HUBERT . Then was the family tomb unsealed , And broken helmet , sword , and shield Buried together , in common wreck , As is the custom when the last Of any princely house has passed , And thrice , as with a trumpet-blast , A herald shouted down the stair The words of warning and despair ,— “ O Hoheneck ! O Hoheneck ! ”</p>
     <p>WALTER . Still in my soul that cry goes on ,— Forever gone ! forever gone ! Ah , what a cruel sense of loss , Like a black shadow , would fall across The hearts of all , if he should die ! His gracious presence upon earth Was as a fire upon a hearth ; As pleasant songs , at morning sung , The words that dropped from his sweet tongue Strengthened our hearts ; or heard at night Made all our slumbers soft and light . Where is he ?</p>
     <p>HUBERT . In the Odenwald . Some of his tenants , unappalled By fear of death , or priestly word ,— A holy family , that make Each meal a Supper of the Lord ,— Have him beneath their watch and ward , For love of him , and Jesus ’ sake ! Pray you come in . For why should I With out-door hospitality My prince 's friend thus entertain ?</p>
     <p>WALTER . I would a moment here remain . But you , good Hubert , go before , Fill me a goblet of May-drink , As aromatic as the May From which it steals the breath away , And which he loved so well of yore ; It is of him that I would think . You shall attend me , when I call , In the ancestral banquet-hall . Unseen companions , guests of air , You cannot wait on , will be there ; They taste not food , they drink not wine , But their soft eyes look into mine , And their lips speak to me , and all The vast and shadowy banquet-hall Is full of looks and words divine !</p>

       <l n="1">The day is done ; and slowly from the scene</l>
       <l n="2">The stooping sun up-gathers his spent shafts ,</l>
       <l n="3">And puts them back into his golden quiver !</l>
       <l n="4">Below me in the valley , deep and green</l>
       <l n="5">As goblets are , from which in thirsty draughts</l>
       <l n="6">We drink its wine , the swift and mantling river</l>
       <l n="7">Flows on triumphant through these lovely regions ,</l>
       <l n="8">Etched with the shadows of its sombre margent ,</l>
       <l n="9">And soft , reflected clouds of gold and argent !</l>
       <l n="10">Yes , there it flows , forever , broad and still</l>
       <l n="11">As when the vanguard of the Roman legions</l>
       <l n="12">First saw it from the top of yonder hill !</l>
       <l n="13">How beautiful it is ! Fresh fields of wheat ,</l>
       <l n="14">Vineyard and town , and tower with fluttering flag ,</l>
       <l n="15">The consecrated chapel on the crag ,</l>
       <l n="16">And the white hamlet gathered round its base ,</l>
       <l n="17">Like Mary sitting at her Saviour 's feet ,</l>
       <l n="18">And looking up at his beloved face !</l>
       <l n="19">O friend ! O best of friends ! Thy absence more</l>

       <l n="41">Sat singing ,</l>
       <l n="42">So sweet , and clear , and loud ,</l>
       <l n="43">It seemed a thousand harp-strings ringing .</l>

     <p>ELSIE . Here are flowers for you , But they are not all for you . Some of them are for the Virgin And for Saint Cecilia .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . As thou standest there , Thou seemest to me like the angel That brought the immortal roses To Saint Cecilia 's bridal chamber .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . But these will fade .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Themselves will fade , But not their memory , And memory has the power To re-create them from the dust . They remind me , too , Of martyred Dorothea , Who from Celestial gardens sent Flowers as her witnesses To him who scoffed and doubted .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Do you know the story Of Christ and the Sultan 's daughter ! That is the prettiest legend of them all .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Then tell it to me . But first come hither . Lay the flowers down beside me , And put both thy hands in mine . Now tell me the story .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Early in the morning The Sultan 's daughter Walked in her father 's garden , Gathering the bright flowers , All full of dew .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Just as thou hast been doing This morning , dearest Elsie .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . And as she gathered them She wondered more and more Who was the Master of the Flowers , And made them grow Out of the cold , dark earth . “ In my heart , ” she said , “ I love him ; and for him Would leave my father 's palace , To labor in his garden . ”</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Dear , innocent child ! How sweetly thou recallest The long-forgotten legend . That in my early childhood My mother told me ! Upon my brain It reappears once more , As a birth-mark on the forehead When a hand suddenly Is raised upon it , and removed !</p>
     <p>ELSIE . And at midnight , As she lay upon her bed , She heard a voice Call to her from the garden , And , looking forth from her window , She saw a beautiful youth Standing among the flowers . It was the Lord Jesus ; And she went down to Him , And opened the door for Him ; And He said to her , “ O maiden ! Thou hast thought of me with love , And for thy sake Out of my Father 's kingdom Have I come hither : I am the Master of the Flowers . My garden is in Paradise , And if thou wilt go with me , Thy bridal garland Shall be of bright red flowers . ” And then He took from his finger A golden ring , And asked the Sultan 's daughter If she would be his bride . And when she answered Him with love , His wounds began to bleed , And she said to Him , “ O Love ! how red thy heart is , And thy hands are full of roses . ” “ For thy sake , ” answered He , “ For thy sake is my heart so red , For thee I bring these roses ; I gathered them at the cross Whereon I died for thee ! I Come , for my Father calls . Thou art my elected bride ! ” And the Sultan 's daughter Followed Him to his Father 's garden .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Wouldst thou have done so , Elsie ?</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Yes , very gladly .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Then the Celestial Bridegroom Will come for thee also . Upon thy forehead He will place , Not his crown of thorns , But a crown of roses . In thy bridal chamber , Like Saint Cecilia , Thou shalt hear sweet music , And breathe the fragrance Of flowers immortal ! Go now and place these flowers Before her picture .</p>

     <p>URSULA . They are sitting with Elsie at the door . She is telling them stories of the wood , And the Wolf , and little Red Ridinghood .</p>
     <p>GOTTLIEB . And where is the Prince ?</p>
     <p>URSULA . In his room overhead ; I heard him walking across the floor , As he always does , with a heavy tread .</p>
     <p>ELSIE comes in with a lamp . MAX and BERTHA follow her ; and they all sing the Evening Song on the lighting of the lamps .</p>

     <p>ELSIE . It was the Prince : he stood at the door , And listened a moment , as we chanted The evening song . He is gone again . I have often seen him there before .</p>
     <p>URSULA . Poor Prince !</p>
     <p>GOTTLIEB . I thought the house was haunted ! Poor Prince , alas ! and yet as mild And patient as the gentlest child !</p>
     <p>MAX . I love him because he is so good , And makes me such fine bows and arrows , To shoot at the robins and the sparrows , And the red squirrels in the wood !</p>
     <p>BERTHA . I love him , too !</p>
     <p>GOTTLIEB . Ah , yes ! we all Love him from the bottom of our hearts ; He gave us the farm , the house , and the grange , He gave us the horses and the carts , And the great oxen in the stall , The vineyard , and the forest range ! We have nothing to give him but our love !</p>
     <p>BERTHA . Did he give us the beautiful stork above On the chimney-top , with its large , round nest ?</p>
     <p>GOTTLIEB . No , not the stork ; by God in heaven , As a blessing , the dear white stork was given , But the Prince has given us all the rest . God bless him , and make him well again .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Would I could do something for his sake , Something to cure his sorrow and pain !</p>
     <p>GOTTLIEB . That no one can ; neither thou nor I , Nor any one else .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . And must he die ?</p>
     <p>URSULA . Yes ; if the dear God does not take Pity upon him in his distress , And work a miracle !</p>
     <p>GOTTLIEB . Or unless Some maiden , of her own accord , Offers her life for that of her lord , And is willing to die in his stead .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . I will !</p>
     <p>URSULA . Prithee , thou foolish child , be still ! Thou shouldst not say what thou dost not mean !</p>
     <p>ELSIE . I mean it truly !</p>
     <p>MAX . O father ! this morning , Down by the mill , in the ravine , Hans killed a wolf , the very same That in the night to the sheepfold came , And ate up my lamb , that was left outside .</p>
     <p>GOTTLIEB . I am glad he is dead . It will be a warning To the wolves in the forest , far and wide .</p>
     <p>MAX . And I am going to have his hide !</p>
     <p>BERTHA . I wonder if this is the wolf that ate Little Red Ridinghood !</p>
     <p>URSULA . Oh , no ! That wolf was killed a long while ago . Come , children , it is growing late .</p>
     <p>MAX . Ah , how I wish I were a man , As stout as Hans is , and as strong ! I would do nothing else , the whole day long , But just kill wolves .</p>
     <p>GOTTLIEB . Then go to bed , And grow as fast as a little boy can . Bertha is half asleep already . See how she nods her heavy head , And her sleepy feet are so unsteady She will hardly be able to creep upstairs .</p>
     <p>URSULA . Goodnight , my children . Here 's the light . And do not forget to say your prayers Before you sleep .</p>
     <p>GOTTLIEB . Good night !</p>

      <head>THE CHAMBER OF GOTTLIEB AND URSULA</head>
       <l n="1">Midnight . ELSIE standing by their bedside , weeping .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>GOTTLIEB . The wind is roaring ; the rushing rain Is loud upon roof and window-pane , As if the Wild Huntsman of Rodenstein , Boding evil to me and mine , Were abroad to-night with his ghostly train ! In the brief lulls of the tempest wild , The dogs howl in the yard ; and hark ! Some one is sobbing in the dark , Here in the chamber !</p>
     <p>ELSIE . It is I .</p>
     <p>URSULA . Elsie ! what ails thee , my poor child ?</p>
     <p>ELSIE . I am disturbed and much distressed , In thinking our dear Prince must die ; I cannot close mine eyes , nor rest ,</p>
     <p>GOTTLIEB . What wouldst thou ? In the Power Divine His healing lies , not in our own ; It is in the hand of God alone ,</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Nay , He has put it into mine , And into my heart !</p>
     <p>GOTTLIEB . Thy words are wild !</p>
     <p>URSULA . What dost thou mean ? my child ! My child !</p>
     <p>ELSIE . That for our dear Prince Henry 's sake I will myself the offering make , And give my life to purchase his .</p>
     <p>URSULA . Am I still dreaming , or awake ? Thou speakest carelessly of death , And yet thou knowest not what it is .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . ‘ T is the cessation of our breath . Silent and motionless we lie ; And no one knoweth more than this . I saw our little Gertrude die ; She left off breathing , and no more I smoothed the pillow beneath her head . She was more beautiful than before . Like violets faded were her eyes ; By this we knew that she was dead . Through the open window looked the skies Into the chamber where she lay , And the wind was like the sound of wings , As if angels came to bear her away . Ah ! when I saw and felt these things , I found it difficult to stay ; I longed to die , as she had died , And go forth with her , side by side . The Saints are dead , the Martyrs dead And Mary , and our Lord ; and I Would follow in humility The way by them illumined !</p>
     <p>URSULA . My child ! my child ! thou must not die !</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Why should I live ? Do I not know The life of woman is full of woe ? Toiling on and on and on , With breaking heart , and tearful eyes , And silent lips , and in the soul The secret longings that arise , Which this world never satisfies ! Some more , some less , but of the whole Not one quite happy , no , not one !</p>
     <p>URSULA . It is the malediction of Eve !</p>
     <p>ELSIE . In place of it , let me receive The benediction of Mary , then .</p>
     <p>GOTTLIEB . Ah , woe is me ! Ah , woe is me ! Most wretched am I among men !</p>
     <p>URSULA . Alas ! that I should live to see Thy death , beloved , and to stand Above thy grave ! Ah , woe the day !</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Thou wilt not see it . I shall lie Beneath the flowers of another land , For at Salerno , far away Over the mountains , over the sea , It is appointed me to die ! And it will seem no more to thee Than if at the village on market-day I should a little longer stay Than I am wont .</p>
     <p>URSULA . Even as thou sayest ! And how my heart beats , when thou stayest ! I cannot rest until my sight Is satisfied with seeing thee , What , then , if thou wert dead ?</p>
     <p>GOTTLIEB . Ah me ! Of our old eyes thou art the light ! The joy of our old hearts art thou ! And wilt thou die ?</p>
     <p>URSULA . Not now ! not now !</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Christ died for me , and shall not ! Be willing for my Prince to die ? You both are silent ; you cannot speak This said I at our Saviour 's feast After confession , to the priest , And even he made no reply . Does he not warn us all to seek The happier , better land on high , Where flowers immortal never wither ; And could he forbid me to go thither ?</p>
     <p>GOTTLIEB . In God 's own time , my heart 's delight ! When He shall call thee , not before !</p>
     <p>ELSIE . I heard Him call . When Christ ascended Triumphantly , from star to star , He left the gates of heaven ajar . I had a vision in the night , And saw Him standing at the door Of his Father 's mansion , vast and splendid , And beckoning to me from afar . I cannot stay !</p>
     <p>GOTTLIEB . She speaks almost As if it were the Holy Ghost Spake through her lips , and in her stead : What if this were of God ?</p>
     <p>URSULA . Ah , then Gainsay it dare we not .</p>
     <p>GOTTLIEB . Amen ! Elsie ! the words that thou hast said Are strange and new for us to hear , And fill our hears with doubt and fear . Whether it be a dark temptation Of the Evil One , or God 's inspiration , We in our blindness cannot say . We must think upon it , and pray ; For evil and good it both resembles . If it be of God , his will be done ! May He guard us from the Evil One ! How hot thy hand is ! how it trembles ! Go to thy bed , and try to sleep .</p>
     <p>URSULA . Kiss me . Good night ; and do not weep !</p>
     <p>ELSIE goes out .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Ah , what an awful thing is this !</l>
       <l n="2">I almost shuddered at her kiss ,</l>
       <l n="3">As if a ghost had touched my cheek ,</l>
       <l n="4">I am so childish and so weak !</l>
       <l n="5">As soon as I see the earliest gray</l>
       <l n="6">Of morning glimmer in the east ,</l>
       <l n="7">I will go over to the priest ,</l>
       <l n="8">And hear what the good man has to say .</l>

       <l n="173">PRINCE HENRY , entering and kneeling at the confessional .</l>
       <l n="174">Remorseful , penitent , and lowly ,</l>
       <l n="175">I come to crave , O Father holy ,</l>
       <l n="176">Thy benediction on my head .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>LUCIFER . The benediction shall be said After confession , not before ! ‘ T is a God-speed to the parting guest , Who stands already at the door , Sandalled with holiness , and dressed In garments pure from earthly stain . Meanwhile , hast thou searched well thy breast ? Does the same madness fill thy brain ? Or have thy passion and unrest Vanished forever from thy mind ?</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . By the same madness still made blind , By the same passion still possessed , I come again to the house of prayer , A man afflicted and distressed ! As in a cloudy atmosphere , Through unseen sluices of the air , A sudden and impetuous wind Strikes the great forest white with fear , And every branch , and bough , and spray , Points all its quivering leaves one way , And meadows of grass , and fields of rain , And the clouds above , and the slanting rain , And smoke from chimneys of the town , Yield themselves to it , and bow down , So does this dreadful purpose press Onward , with irresistible stress , And all my thoughts and faculties , Struck level by the strength of this , From their true inclination turn And all stream forward to Salem !</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . Alas ! we are but eddies of dust , Uplifted by the blast , and whirled Along the highway of the world A moment only , then to fall Back to a common level all , At the subsiding of the gust !</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . O holy Father ! pardon in me The oscillation of a mind Unsteadfast , and that cannot find Its centre of rest and harmony ! For evermore before mine eyes This ghastly phantom flits and flies , And as a madman through a crowd , With frantic gestures and wild cries , It hurries onward , and aloud Repeats its awful prophecies ! Weakness is wretchedness ! To be strong Is to be happy ! I am weak , And cannot find the good I seek , Because I feel and fear the wrong !</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . Be not alarmed ! The church is kind , And in her mercy and her meekness She meets half-way her children 's weakness , Writes their transgressions in the dust ! Though in the Decalogue we find The mandate written , “ Thou shalt not kill ! ” Yet there are cases when we must . In war , for instance , or from scathe To guard and keep the one true faith We must look at the Decalogue in the light Of an ancient statute , that was meant For a mild and general application , To be understood with the reservation That in certain instances the Right Must yield to the Expedient ! Thou art a Prince . If thou shouldst die What hearts and hopes would prostrate lie ! What noble deeds , what fair renown , Into the grave with thee go down ! What acts of valor and courtesy Remain undone , and die with thee ! Thou art the last of all thy race ! With thee a noble name expires , And vanishes from the earth 's face The glorious memory of thy sires ! She is a peasant . In her veins Flows common and plebeian blood ; It is such as daily and hourly stains The dust and the turf of battle plains , By vassals shed , in a crimson flood , Without reserve and without reward , At the slightest summons of their lord ! But thine is precious ; the fore-appointed Blood of kings , of God 's anointed ! Moreover , what has the world in store For one like her , but tears and toil ? Daughter of sorrow , serf of the soil , A peasant 's child and a peasant 's wife , And her soul within her sick and sore With the roughness and barrenness of life ! I marvel not at the heart 's recoil From a fate like this , in one so tender , Nor at its eagerness to surrender All the wretchedness , want , and woe That await it in this world below , For the unutterable splendor Of the world of rest beyond the skies . So the Church sanctions the sacrifice : Therefore inhale this healing balm , And breathe this fresh life into thine ; Accept the comfort and the calm She offers , as a gift divine ; Let her fall down and anoint thy feet With the ointment costly and most sweet Of her young blood , and thou shalt live .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . And will the righteous Heaven forgive ? No action , whether foal or fair , Is ever done , but it leaves somewhere A record , written by fingers ghostly , As a blessing or a curse , and mostly In the greater weakness or greater strength Of the acts which follow it , till at length The wrongs of ages are redressed , And the justice of God made manifest !</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . In ancient records it is stated That , whenever an evil deed is done , Another devil is created To scourge and torment the offending one ! But evil is only good perverted , And Lucifer , the bearer of Light , But an angel fallen and deserted , Thrust from his Father 's house with a curse Into the black and endless night .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . If justice rules the universe , From the good actions of good men Angels of light should be begotten . And thus the balance restored again .</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . Yes ; if the world were not so rotten , And so given over to the Devil !</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . But this deed , is it good or evil ? Have I thine absolution free To do it , and without restriction ?</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . Ay ; and from whatsoever sin Lieth around it and within , From all crimes in which it may involve thee , I now release thee and absolve thee !</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Give me thy holy benediction .</p>

     <p>A ROOM IN THE FARM-HOUSE</p>
     <p>GOTTLIEB . It is decided ! For many days , And nights as many , we have had A nameless terror in our breast , Making us timid , and afraid Of God , and his mysterious ways ! We have been sorrowful and sad ; Much have we suffered , much have prayed That He would lead us as is best , And show us what his will required . It is decided ; and we give Our child , O Prince , that you may live !</p>
     <p>URSULA . It is of God . He has inspired This purpose in her : and through pain , Out of a world of sin and woe , He takes her to Himself again . The mother 's heart resists no longer ; With the Angel of the Lord in vain It wrestled , for he was the stronger .</p>
     <p>GOTTLIEB . As Abraham offered long ago His son unto the Lord , and even The Everlasting Father in heaven Gave his , as a lamb unto the slaughter , So do I offer up my daughter !</p>
     <p>URSULA hides her face .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . My life is little , Only a cup of water , But pure and limpid . Take it , O my Prince ! Let it refresh you , Let it restore you . It is given willingly , It is given freely ; May God bless the gift !</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY , And the giver !</p>

       <l n="1">ELSIE .</l>
       <l n="2">I have one thing to ask of you .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . What is it ? It is already granted .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Promise me , When we are gone from here , and on our way Are journeying to Salerno , you will not , By word or deed , endeavor to dissuade me And turn me from my purpose ; but remember That as a pilgrim to the Holy City Walks unmolested , and with thoughts of pardon Occupied wholly , so would I approach The gates of Heaven , in this great jubilee , With my petition , putting off from me All thoughts of earth , as shoes from off my feet . Promise me this .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Thy words fall from thy lips Like roses from the lips of Angelo : and angels Might stoop to pick them up !</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Will you not promise ?</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . If ever we depart upon this journey , So long to one or both of us , I promise .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Shall we not go , then ? Have you lifted me Into the air , only to hurl me back Wounded upon the ground ? and offered me The waters of eternal life , to bid me Drink the polluted puddles of the world ?</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . O Elsie ! what a lesson thou dost teach me ! The life which is , and that which is to come , Suspended hang in such nice equipoise A breath disturbs the balance ; and that scale In which we throw our hearts preponderates , And the other , like an empty one , flies up , And is accounted vanity and air ! To me the thought of death is terrible , Having such hold on life . To thee it is not So much even as the lifting of a latch ; Only a step into the open air Out of a tent already luminous With light that shines through its transparent walls ! O pure in heart ! from thy sweet dust shall grow Lilies , upon whose petals will be written “ Ave Maria ” in characters of gold !</p>

      <head>A STREET IN STRASBURG</head>
       <l n="1">Night . PRINCE HENRY wandering alone , wrapped in a cloak .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Still is the night . The sound of feet Has died away from the empty street , And like an artisan , bending down His head on his anvil , the dark town Sleeps , with a slumber deep and sweet . Sleepless and restless , I alone , In the dusk and damp of these walls of stone , Wander and weep in my remorse !</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">CRIER OF THE DEAD , ringing a bell .</l>
       <l n="2">Wake ! wake !</l>
       <l n="3">All ye that sleep !</l>
       <l n="4">Pray for the Dead !</l>
       <l n="5">Pray for the Dead !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Hark ! with what accents loud and hoarse This warder on the walls of death Sends forth the challenge of his breath ! I see the dead that sleep in the grave ! They rise up and their garments wave , Dimly and spectral , as they rise , With the light of another world in their eyes !</p>
     <p>CRIER OF THE DEAD . Wake ! wake ! All ye that sleep ! Pray for the Dead ! Pray for the Dead !</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY , Why for the dead , who are at rest ? Pray for the living , in whose breast The struggle between right and wrong Is raging terrible and strong , As when good angels war with devils ! This is the Master of the Revels , Who , at Life 's flowing feast , proposes The health of absent friends , and pledges , Not in bright goblets crowned with roses , And tinkling as we touch their edges , But with his dismal , tinkling bell . That mocks and mimics their funeral knell .</p>
     <p>CRIER OP THE DEAD . Wake ! wake ! All ye that sleep ! Pray for the Dead ! Pray for the Dead !</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Wake not , beloved ! be thy sleep Silent as night is , and as deep ! There walks a sentinel at thy gate Whose heart is heavy and desolate , And the heavings of whose bosom number The respirations of thy slumber , As if some strange , mysterious fate Had linked two hearts in one , and mine Went madly wheeling about thine , Only with wider and wilder sweep !</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">CRIER OP THE DEAD , at a distance .</l>
       <l n="2">Wake ! wake !</l>

       <l n="5">Pray for the Dead !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Lo ! with what depth of blackness thrown Against the clouds , far up the skies The walls of the cathedral rise , Like a mysterious grove of stone , With fitful lights and shadows blending , As from behind , the moon ascending , Lights its dim aisles and paths unknown ! The wind is rising ; but the boughs Rise not and fall not with the wind , That through their foliage sobs and soughs ; Only the cloudy rack behind , Drifting onward , wild and ragged , Gives to each spire and buttress jagged A seeming motion undefined . Below on the square , an armed knight , Still as a statue and as white , Sits on his steed , and the moonbeams quiver Upon the points of his armor bright As on the ripples of a river . He lifts the visor from his cheek , And beckons , and makes as he would speak .</p>

       <l n="5">And wander vainly up and down .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . I am a stranger in the town . As thou art ; but the voice I hear Is not a stranger to mine ear . Thou art Walter of the Vogelweid !</p>

       <l n="4">Has drawn thee from thy German farm</l>
       <l n="5">Into the old Alsatian city ?</l>
     </lg>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . A tale of wonder and of pity ! A wretched man , almost by stealth Dragging my body to Salem , In the vain hope and search for health , And destined never to return . Already thou hast heard the rest . But what brings thee , thus armed and dight In the equipments of a knight ?</p>
     <p>WALTER . Dost thou not see upon my breast The cross of the Crusaders shine ? My pathway leads to Palestine .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Ah , would that way were also mine ! O noble poet ! thou whose heart Is like a nest of singing-birds Rocked on the topmost bough of life , Wilt thou , too , from our sky depart , And in the clangor of the strife Mingle the music of thy words ?</p>
     <p>WALTER . My hopes are high , my heart is proud , And like a trumpet long and loud , Thither my thoughts all clang and ring ! My life is in my hand , and lo ! I grasp and bend it as a bow , And shoot forth from its trembling string An arrow , that shall be , perchance , Like the arrow of the Israelite king Shot from the window towards the east . That of the Lord 's deliverance !</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . My life , alas ! is what thou seest ! O enviable fate ! to be Strong , beautiful , and armed like thee With lyre and sword , with song and steel ; A hand to smite , a heart to feel ! Thy heart , thy hand , thy lyre , thy sword , Thou givest all unto thy Lord ; While I , so mean and abject grown , Am thinking of myself alone ,</p>
     <p>WALTER . Be patient ; Time will reinstate Thy health and fortunes .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . ‘ T is too late ! I cannot strive against my fate !</p>
     <p>WALTER . Come with me ; for my steed is weary ; Our journey has been long and dreary , And , dreaming of his stall , he dints With his impatient hoofs the flints .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">PRINCE HENRY , aside .</l>
       <l n="2">I am ashamed , in my disgrace ,</l>
       <l n="3">To look into that noble face !</l>
       <l n="4">To-morrow , Walter , let it be .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>WALTER . To-morrow , at the dawn of day , I shall again be on my way . Come with me to the hostelry , For I have many things to say . Our journey into Italy Perchance together we may make ; Wilt thou not do it for my sake ?</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . A sick man 's pace would but impede Thine eager and impatient speed . Besides , my pathway leads me round To Hirsehau , in the forest 's bound , Where I assemble man and steed , And all things for my journey 's need .</p>
     <p>They go out .</p>

      <head>SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE CATHEDRAL</head>
      <head>Easter Sunday . FRIAR CUTHBERT preaching to the crowd from a pulpit in the open air . PRINCE HENRY and Elsie crossing the square .</head>
      <head>PRINCE HENRY . This is the day , when from the dead Our Lord arose ; and everywhere , Out of their darkness and despair , Triumphant over fears and foes , The hearts of his disciples rose , When to the women , standing near , The Angel in shining vesture said , “ The Lord is risen ; he is not here ! ” And , mindful that the day is come , On all the hearths in Christendom The fires are quenched , to be again Rekindled from the sun , that high Is dancing in the cloudless sky . The churches are all decked with flowers , The salutations among men Are but the Angel 's words divine , “ Christ is arisen ! ” and the bells Catch the glad murmur , as it swells , And chant together in their towers . All hearts are glad ; and free from care The faces of the people shine . See what a crowd is in the square , Gayly and gallantly arrayed !</head>
       <l n="1">ELSIE .</l>
       <l n="2">Let us go back ; I am afraid !</l>

     <p>ELSIE . What a gay pageant ! what bright dresses ! It looks like a flower-besprinkled meadow . What is that yonder on the square ?</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . A pulpit in the open air , And a Friar , who is preaching to the crowd In a voice so deep and clear and loud , That , if we listen , and give heed , His lowest words will reach the ear .</p>

     <p>IN THE CATHEDRAL</p>
     <p>CHANT . Kyrie Eleison Christe Eleison !</p>
     <p>ELSIE . I am at home here in my Father 's house ! These paintings of the Saints upon the walls Have all familiar and benignant faces .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . The portraits of the family of God ! Thine own hereafter shall be placed among them .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . How very grand it is and wonderful ! Never have I beheld a church so splendid ! Such columns , and such arches , and such windows , So many tombs and statues in the chapels , And under them so many confessionals . They must be for the rich . I should not like To tell my sins in such a church as this . Who built it ?</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . A great master of his craft , Erwin von Steinbach ; but not he alone , For many generations labored with him . Children that came to see these Saints in stone , As day by day out of the blocks they rose , Grew old and died , and still the work went on , And on , and on , and is not yet completed . The generation that succeeds our own Perhaps may finish it . The architect Built his great heart into these sculptured stones , And with him toiled his children , and their lives Were builded , with his own , into the walls , As offerings unto God . You see that statue Fixing its joyous , but deep-wrinkled eyes Upon the Pillars of the Angels yonder . That is the image of the master , carved By the fair hand of his own child , Sabina .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . How beautiful is the column that he looks at !</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . That , too , she sculptured . At the base of it Stand the Evangelists ; above their heads Four Angels blowing upon marble trumpets , And over them the blessed Christ , surrounded By his attendant ministers , upholding The instruments of his passion .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . O my Lord ! Would I could leave behind me upon earth Some monument to thy glory , such as this !</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . A greater monument than this thou leavest In thine own life , all purity and love ! See , too , the Rose , above the western portal Resplendent with a thousand gorgeous colors , The perfect flower of Gothic loveliness !</p>
     <p>ELSIE . And , in the gallery , the long line of statues , Christ with his twelve Apostles watching us !</p>
     <p>A Bishop in armor , booted and spurred , passes with his train .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . But come away ; we have not time to look , The crowd already fills the church , and yonder Upon a stage , a herald with a trumpet , Clad like the Angel Gabriel , proclaims The Mystery that will now be represented .</p>

     <p>GOD . He shall be saved , if that within The bounds of earth one free from sin Be found , who for his kith and kin Will suffer martyrdom .</p>

     <p>MELCHIOR . Hail to thee , King of Jerusalem ! Though humbly born in Bethlehem , A sceptre and a diadem Await thy brow and hand ! The sceptre is a simple reed , The crown will make thy temples bleed , And in thine hour of greatest need , Abashed thy subjects stand !</p>

     <p>RABBI . I am the Rabbi Ben Israel , Throughout this village known full well , And , as my scholars all will tell , Learned in things divine ; The Cabala and Talmud hoar Than all the prophets prize I more , For water is all Bible lore , But Mishna is strong wine .</p>

     <p>JUDAS . In the Rabbinical Book , it saith The dogs howl , when with icy breath Great Sammael , the Angel of Death , Takes through the town his flight !</p>
     <p>RABBI . Well , boy ! now say , if thou art wise , When the Angel of Death , who is full of eyes , Comes where a sick man dying lies , What doth he to the wight ?</p>
     <p>JUDAS . He stands beside him , dark and tall , Holding a sword , from which doth fall Into his mouth a drop of gall , And so he turneth white .</p>
     <p>RABBI . And now , my Judas , say to me What the great Voices Four may be , That quite across the world do flee , And are not heard by men ?</p>
     <p>JUDAS . The Voice of the Sun in heaven 's dome , The Voice of the Murmuring of Rome , The Voice of a Soul that goeth home , And the Angel of the Rain !</p>
     <p>RABBI . Right are thine answers every one ! Now , little Jesus , the carpenter 's son , Let us see how thy task is done ; Canst thou thy letters say ?</p>
     <p>JESUS . Aleph .</p>

      <head>THE ROAD TO HIRSCHAU</head>
       <l n="1">PRINCE HENRY and ELSIE , with their attendants on horseback .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>ELSIE . Onward and onward the highway runs to the distant city , impatiently bearing Tidings of human joy and disaster , of love and of hate , of doing and daring !</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . This life of ours is a wild aeolian harp of many a joyous strain , But under them all there runs a loud perpetual wail , as of souls in pain .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Faith alone can interpret life , and the heart that aches and bleeds with the stigma Of pain , alone bears the likeness of Christ , and can comprehend its dark enigma .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Man is selfish , and seeketh pleasure with little care of what may betide , Else why am I travelling here beside thee , a demon that rides by an angel 's side ?</p>
     <p>ELSIE . All the hedges are white with dust , and the great dog under the creaking wain Hangs his head in the lazy heat , while onward the horses toil and strain .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Now they stop at the wayside inn , and the wagoner laughs with the landlord 's daughter , While out of the dripping trough the horses distend their leathern sides with water .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . All through life there are wayside inns , where man may refresh his soul with love ; Even the lowest may quench his thirst at rivulets fed by springs from above .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Yonder , where rises the cross of stone , our journey along the highway ends , And over the fields , by a bridle path , down into the broad green valley descends .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . I am not sorry to leave behind the beaten road with its dust and heat The air will be sweeter far , and the turf will be softer under our horses ’ feet .</p>
     <p>They turn down a green lane .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Sweet is the air with the budding haws , and the valley stretching for miles below Is white with blossoming cherry-trees , as if just covered with lightest snow .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Over our heads a white cascade is gleaming against the distant hill ; We cannot hear it , nor see it move , but it hangs like a banner when winds are still .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Damp and cool is this deep ravine , and cool the sound of the brook by our side ! What is this castle that rises above us , and lords it over a land so wide ?</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . It is the home of the Counts of Calva ; well have I known these scenes of old , Well I remember each tower and turret , remember the brooklet , the wood , and the wold .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Hark ! from the little village below us the bells of the church are ringing for rain ! Priests and peasants in long procession come forth and kneel on the arid plain .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . They have not long to wait , for I see in the south uprising a little cloud , That before the sun shall be set will cover the sky above us as with a shroud .</p>
     <p>They pass on .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>FRIAR CLAUS . I always enter this sacred place With a thoughtful , solemn , and reverent pace , Pausing long enough on each stair To breathe an ejaculatory prayer , And a benediction on the vines That produce these various sorts of wines ! For my part , I am well content That we have got through with the tedious Lent ! Fasting is all very well for those Who have to contend with invisible foes ; But I am quite sure it does not agree With a quiet , peaceable man like me , Who am not of that nervous and meagre kind , That are always distressed in body and mind ! And at times it really does me good To come down among this brotherhood , Dwelling forever underground , Silent , contemplative , round and sound ; Each one old , and brown with mould , But filled to the lips with the ardor of youth , With the latent power and love of truth , And with virtues fervent and manifold .</p>

       <l n="4">Then in all cellars , far and wide ,</l>
       <l n="5">The oldest as well as the newest wine</l>
       <l n="6">Begins to stir itself , and ferment ,</l>
       <l n="7">With a kind of revolt and discontent</l>
       <l n="8">At being so long in darkness pent ,</l>
       <l n="9">And fain would burst from its sombre tun</l>
       <l n="10">To bask on the hillside in the sun ;</l>
       <l n="11">As in the bosom of us poor friars ,</l>
       <l n="12">The tumult of half-subdued desires</l>

       <l n="15">And now that we have lived through Lent ,</l>
       <l n="16">My duty it is , as often before ,</l>
       <l n="17">To open awhile the prison-door ,</l>

      <head>THE CLOISTERS</head>
       <l n="1">The ABBOT ERNESTUS pacing to and fro .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>ABBOT . Slowly , slowly up the wall Steals the sunshine , steals the shade ; Evening damps begin to fall , Evening shadows are displayed . Round me , o'er me , everywhere , All the sky is grand with clouds , And athwart the evening air Wheel the swallows home in crowds . Shafts of sunshine from the west Paint the dusky windows red ; Darker shadows , deeper rest , Underneath and overhead . Darker , darker , and more wan , In my breast the shadows fall ; Upward steals the life of man , As the sunshine from the wall . From the wall into the sky , From the roof along the spire ; Ah , the souls of those that die Are but sunbeams lifted higher .</p>
     <p>Enter PRINCE HENRY .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Christ is arisen !</p>
     <p>ABBOT . Amen ! He is arisen ! His peace be with you !</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Here it reigns forever ! The peace of God , that passeth understanding , Reigns in these cloisters and these corridors . Are you Ernestus , Abbot of the convent ?</p>
     <p>ABBOT . I am .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . And I Prince Henry of Hoheneck , Who crave your hospitality to-night .</p>
     <p>ABBOT . You are thrice welcome to our humble walls . You do us honor ; and we shall requite it , I fear , but poorly , entertaining you With Paschal eggs , and our poor convent wine , The remnants of our Easter holidays .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . How fares it with the holy monks of Hirschau ? Are all things well with them ?</p>
     <p>ABBOT . All things are well .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . A noble convent ! I have known it long By the report of travellers . I now see Their commendations lag behind the truth . You lie here in the valley of the Nagold As in a nest : and the still river , gliding Along its bed , is like an admonition How all things pass . Your lands are rich and ample , And your revenues large . God 's benediction Rests on your convent .</p>
     <p>ABBOT . By our charities We strive to merit it . Our Lord and Master , When He departed , left us in his will , As our best legacy on earth , the poor ! These we have always with us ; had we not , Our hearts would grow as hard as are these stones .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . If I remember right , the Counts of Calva Founded your convent .</p>
     <p>ABBOT . Even as you say .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . And , if I err not , it is very old .</p>
     <p>ABBOT . Within these cloisters lie already buried Twelve holy Abbots . Underneath the flags On which we stand , the Abbot William lies , Of blessed memory .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . And whose tomb is that , Which bears the brass escutcheon ?</p>
     <p>ABBOT . A benefactor 's . Conrad , a Count of Calva , he who stood Godfather to our bells .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Your monks are learned And holy men , I trust .</p>
     <p>ABBOT . There are among them Learned and holy men . Yet in this age We need another Hildebrand , to shake And purify us like a mighty wind . The world is wicked , and sometimes I wonder God does not lose his patience with it wholly , And shatter it like glass ! Even here , at times , Within these walls , where all should be at peace , I have my trials . Time has laid his hand Upon my heart , gently , not smiting it , But as a harper lays his open palm Upon his harp to deaden its vibrations , Ashes are on my head , and on my lips Sackcloth , and in my breast a heaviness And weariness of life , that makes me ready To say to the dead Abbots under us , “ Make room for me ! ” Ony I see the dusk Of evening twilight coming , and have not Completed half my task ; and so at times The thought of my shortcomings in this life Falls like a shadow on the life to come .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . We must all die , and not the old alone ; The young have no exemption from that doom .</p>
     <p>ABBOT . Ah , yes ! the young may die , but the old must ! That is the difference .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . I have heard much laud Of your transcribers , Your Scriptorium Is famous among all ; your manuscripts Praised for their beauty and their excellence .</p>
     <p>ABBOT . That is indeed our boast . If you desire it You shall behold these treasures . And meanwhile Shall the Refectorarius bestow Your horses and attendants for the night .</p>
     <p>They go in . The Vesper-bell rings .</p>

       <l n="1">Vespers : after which the monks retire , a chorister leading an old</l>
       <l n="2">monk who is blind .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . They are all gone , save one who lingers , Absorbed in deep and silent prayer . As if his heart could find no rest , At times he beats his heaving breast With clenched and convulsive fingers , Then lifts them trembling in the air . A chorister , with golden hair , Guides hitherward his heavy pace . Can it be so ? Or does my sight Deceive me in the uncertain light ? Ah no ! I recognize that face Though Time has touched it in his flight , And changed the auburn hair to white . It is Count Hugo of the Rhine , The deadliest foe of all our race , And hateful unto me and mine !</p>
     <p>THE BLIND MONK . Who is it that doth stand so near His whispered words I almost hear ?</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . I am Prince Henry of Hoheneck , And you , Count Hugo of the Rhine ! I know you , and I see the scar , The brand upon your forehead , shine And redden like a baleful star !</p>
     <p>THE BLIND MONK . Count Hugo once , but now the wreck Of what I was . O Hoheneck ! The passionate will , the pride , the wrath That bore me headlong on my path , Stumbled and staggered into fear , And failed me in my mad career , As a tired steed some evil-doer , Alone upon a desolate moor , Bewildered , lost , deserted , blind , And hearing loud and close behind The o'ertaking steps of his pursuer . Then suddenly from the dark there came A voice that called me by my name , And said to me , “ Kneel down and pray ! ” And so my terror passed away , Passed utterly away forever . Contrition , penitence , remorse , Came on me , with o'erwhelming force ; A hope , a longing , an endeavor , By days of penance and nights of prayer , To frustrate and defeat despair ! Calm , deep , and still is now my heart , With tranquil waters overflowed ; A lake whose unseen fountains start , Where once the hot volcano glowed . And you , O Prince of Hoheneck ! Have known me in that earlier time , A man of violence and crime , Whose passions brooked no curb nor check . Behold me now , in gentler mood , One of this holy brotherhood . Give me your hand ; here let me kneel ; Make your reproaches sharp as steel ; Spurn me , and smite me on each cheek ; No violence can harm the meek , There is no wound Christ cannot heal ! Yes ; lift your princely hand , and take Revenge , if ‘ t is revenge you seek ; Then pardon me , for Jesus ’ sake !</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Arise , Count Hugo ! let there be No further strife nor enmity Between us twain ; we both have erred Too rash in act , too wroth in word , From the beginning have we stood In fierce , defiant attitude , Each thoughtless of the other 's right , And each reliant on his might . But now our souls are more subdued ; The hand of God , and not in vain , Has touched us with the fire of pain . Let us kneel down and side by side Pray till our souls are purified , And pardon will not be denied !</p>
     <p>They kneel .</p>

     <p>FRIAR JOHN . What is the name of yonder friar , With an eye that glows like a coal of fire , And such a black mass of tangled hair ?</p>
     <p>FRIAR PAUL . He who is sitting there , With a rollicking , Devil may care , Free and easy look and air , As if he were used to such feasting and frolicking ?</p>
     <p>FRIAR JOHN . The same .</p>
     <p>FRIAR PAUL . He 's a stranger . You had better ask his name , And where he is going and whence he came .</p>
     <p>FRIAR JOHN . Hallo ! Sir Friar !</p>
     <p>FRIAR PAUL . You must raise your voice a little higher , He does not seem to hear what you say . Now , try again ! He is looking this way .</p>
     <p>FRIAR JOHN . Hallo ! Sir Friar , We wish to inquire Whence you came , and where you are going , And anything else that is worth the knowing . So be so good as to open your head .</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . I am a Frenchman born and bred , Going on a pilgrimage to Rome . My home Is the convent of St. Gildas de Rhuys , Of which , very like , you never have heard .</p>
     <p>MONKS . Never a word .</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . You must know , then , it is in the diocese Called the Diocese of Vannes , In the province of Brittany . From the gray rocks of Morbihan It overlooks the angry sea ; The very sea-shore where , In his great despair , Abbot Abelard walked to and fro , Filling the night with woe , And wailing aloud to the merciless seas The name of his sweet Heloise , Whilst overhead The convent windows gleamed as red As the fiery eyes of the monks within , Who with jovial din Gave themselves up to all kinds of sin ! Ha ! that is a convent ! that is an abbey ! Over the doors , None of your death-heads carved in wood , None of your Saints looking pious and good , None of your Patriarchs old and shabby ! But the heads and tusks of boars , And the cells Hung all round with the fells Of the fallow-deer . And then what cheer ! What jolly , fat friars , Sitting round the great , roaring fires , Roaring louder than they , With their strong wines , And their concubines , And never a bell , With its swagger and swell , Calling you up with a start of affright In the dead of night , To send you grumbling down dark stairs , To mumble your prayers ; But the cheery crow Of cocks in the yard below , After daybreak , an hour or so , And the barking of deep-mouthed hounds , These are the sounds That , instead of bells , salute the ear . And then all day Up and away Through the forest , hunting the deer ! Ah , my friends , I 'm afraid that here You are a little too pious , a little too tame , And the more is the shame . ‘ T is the greatest folly Not to be jolly ; That 's what I think ! Come , drink , drink , Drink , and die game !</p>
     <p>MONKS . And your Abbot What'shYpppHeNhishYpppHeNname ?</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . Abelard !</p>
     <p>MONKS . Did he drink hard ?</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . Oh , no ! Not he ! He was a dry old fellow , Without juice enough to get thoroughly mellow . There he stood , Lowering at us in sullen mood , As if he had come into Brittany Just to reform our brotherhood !</p>
     <p>A roar of laughter .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">But you see</l>
       <l n="2">It never would do !</l>
       <l n="3">For some of us knew a thing or two ,</l>
       <l n="4">In the Abbey of St. Gildas de Rhuys !</l>
       <l n="5">For instance , the great ado</l>

       <l n="7">The young and lovely Heloise .</l>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>FRIAR CUTHBERT . It is only a poor unfortunate brother , Who is gifted with most miraculous powers Of getting up at all sorts of hours , And , by way of penance and Christian meekness , Of creeping silently out of his cell To take a pull at that hideous bell ; So that all monks who are lying awake May murmur some kind of prayer for his sake , And adapted to his peculiar weakness !</p>
     <p>FRIAR JOHN . From frailty and fall —</p>
     <p>ALL . Good Lord , deliver us all !</p>
     <p>FRIAR CUTHBERT . And before the bell for matins sounds , He takes his lantern , and goes the rounds , Flashing it into our sleepy eyes , Merely to say it is time to arise . But enough of that . Go on , if you please , With your story about St. Gildas de Rhuys .</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . Well , it finally came to pass That , half in fun and half in malice , One Sunday at Mass We put some poison into the chalice . But , either by accident or design , Peter Abelard kept away From the chapel that day , And a poor young friar , who in his stead Drank the sacramental wine , Fell on the steps of the altar , dead ! But look ! do you see at the window there That face , with a look of grief and despair , That ghastly face , as of one in pain ?</p>
     <p>MONKS . Who ? where ?</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . As I spoke , it vanished away again .</p>
     <p>FRIAR CUTHBERT . It is that nefarious Siebald the Refectorarius , That fellow is always playing the scout , Creeping and peeping and prowling about ; And then he regales The Abbot with scandalous tales .</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . A spy in the convent ? One of the brothers Telling scandalous tales of the others ? Out upon him , the lazy loon ! I would put a stop to that pretty soon , In a way he should rue it .</p>
     <p>MONKS . How shall we do it !</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . Do you , brother Paul , Creep under the window , close to the wall , And open it suddenly when I call . Then seize the villain by the hair , And hold him there , And punish him soundly , once for all .</p>
     <p>FRIAR CUTHBERT . As Saint Dunstan of old , We are told , Once caught the Devil by the nose !</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . Ha ! ha ! that story is very clever , But has no foundation whatsoever . Quick ! for I see his face again Glaring in at the window-pane ; Now ! now ! and do not spare your blows .</p>

     <p>ABBOT . What means this revel and carouse ? Is this a tavern and drinking-house ? Are you Christian monks , or heathen devils , To pollute this convent with your revels ? Were Peter Damian still upon earth , To be shocked by such ungodly mirth , He would write your names , with pen of gall , In his Book of Gomorrah , one and all ! Away , you drunkards ! to your cells , And pray till you hear the matin-bells ; You , Brother Francis , and you , Brother Paul ! And as a penance mark each prayer With the scourge upon your shoulders bare ; Nothing atones for such a sin But the blood that follows the discipline . And you , Brother Cuthbert , come with me Alone into the sacristy ; You , who should be a guide to your brothers , And are ten times worse than all the others , For you I 've a draught that has long been brewing , You shall do a penance worth the doing ! Away to your prayers , then , one and all ! I wonder the very convent wall Does not crumble and crush you in its fall !</p>

       <l n="36">And seated on my lowly stool ,</l>

       <l n="42">Still I think of him with pride !</l>
       <l n="43">His song was of the summer-time ,</l>
       <l n="44">The very birds sang in his rhyme ;</l>
       <l n="45">The sunshine , the delicious air ,</l>

       <l n="99">That night from the castle-gate went down</l>

       <l n="110">A foaming brook , with many a bound ,</l>

       <l n="115">That our tardy flight should be betrayed</l>
       <l n="116">By the sound our horses ’ hoof-beats made .</l>

       <l n="128">Night-air of the meadows green and wide ,</l>
       <l n="129">And in a moment , side by side ,</l>
       <l n="130">So close , they must have seemed but one ,</l>
       <l n="131">The shadows across the moonlight run ,</l>

     <p>A COVERED BRIDGE AT LUCERNE</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . God 's blessing on the architects who build The bridges o'er swift rivers and abysses Before impassable to human feet , No less than on the builders of cathedrals , Whose massive walls are bridges thrown across The dark and terrible abyss of Death . Well has the name of Pontifex been given Unto the Church 's head , as the chief builder And architect of the invisible bridge That leads from earth to heaven .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . How dark it grows ! What are these paintings on the walls around us ?</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . The Dance Macaber !</p>
     <p>ELSIE . What ?</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . The Dance of Death ! All that go to and fro must look upon it , Mindful of what they shall be , while beneath , Among the wooden piles , the turbulent river Rushes , impetuous as the river of life , With dimpling eddies , ever green and bright , Save where the shadow of this bridge falls on it .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Oh yes ! I see it now !</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . The grim musician Leads all men through the mazes of that dance , To different sounds in different measures moving ; Sometimes he plays a lute , sometimes a drum , To tempt or terrify .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . What is this picture ?</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . It is a young man singing to a nun , Who kneels at her devotions , but in kneeling Turns round to look at him ; and Death , meanwhile , Is putting out the candles on the altar !</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Ah , what a pity ‘ t is that she should listen Unto such songs , when in her orisons She might have heard in heaven the angels singing !</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Here he has stolen a jester 's cap and bells And dances with the Queen .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . A foolish jest !</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . And here the heart of the new-wedded wife , Coming from church with her beloved lord , He startles with the rattle of his drum .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Ah , that is sad ! And yet perhaps ‘ t is best That she should die , with all the sunshine on her , And all the benedictions of the morning , Before this affluence of golden light Shall fade into a cold and clouded gray , Then into darkness !</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Under it is written , “ Nothing but death shall separate thee and me ! ”</p>
     <p>ELSIE . And what is this , that follows close upon it ?</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Death playing on a dulcimer . Behind him , A poor old woman , with a rosary , Follows the sound , and seems to wish her feet Were swifter to o'ertake him . Underneath , The inscription reads , “ Better is Death than Life . ”</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Better is Death than Life ! Ah yes ! to thousands Death plays upon a dulcimer , and sings That song of consolation , till the air Rings with it , and they cannot choose but follow Whither he leads . And not the old alone , But the young also hear it , and are still .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Yes , in their sadder moments . ‘ T is the sound Of their own hearts they hear , half full of tears , Which are like crystal cups , half filled with water , Responding to the pressure of a finger With music sweet and low and melancholy . Let us go forward , and no longer stay In this great picture-gallery of Death ! I hate it ! ay , the very thought of it !</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Why is it hateful to you ?</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . For the reason That life , and all that speaks of life , is lovely , And death , and all that speaks of death , is hateful .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . The grave itself is but a covered bridge , Leading from light to light , through a brief darkness !</p>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">PRINCE HENRY , emerging from the bridge .</l>
       <l n="2">I breathe again more freely ! Ah , how pleasant</l>
       <l n="3">To come once more into the light of day ,</l>
       <l n="4">Out of that shadow of death ! To hear again</l>
       <l n="5">The hoof-beats of our horses on firm ground ,</l>
       <l n="6">And not upon those hollow planks , resounding</l>
       <l n="7">With a sepulchral echo , like the clods</l>
       <l n="8">On coffins in a churchyard ! Yonder lies</l>
       <l n="9">The Lake of the Four Forest-Towns , apparelled</l>
       <l n="10">In light , and lingering , like a village maiden ,</l>
       <l n="11">Hid in the bosom of her native mountains</l>
       <l n="12">Then pouring all her life into another 's ,</l>
       <l n="13">Changing her name and being ! Overhead ,</l>
       <l n="14">Shaking his cloudy tresses loose in air ,</l>
       <l n="15">Rises Pilatus , with his windy pines .</l>

      <head>THE DEVIL 'S BRIDGE</head>
       <l n="1">PRINCE HENRY and ELSIE crossing with attendants .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>GUIDE . This bridge is called the Devil 's Bridge . With a single arch , from ridge to ridge , It leaps across the terrible chasm Yawning beneath us , black and deep , As if , in some convulsive spasm , The summits of the hills had cracked , And made a road for the cataract That raves and rages down the steep !</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">LUCIFER , under the bridge .</l>
       <l n="2">Ha ! ha !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>GUIDE . Never any bridge but this Could stand across the wild abyss ; All the rest , of wood or stone , By the Devil 's hand were overthrown . He toppled crags from the precipice , And whatsoe'er was built by day In the night was swept away ; None could stand but this alone .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">LUCIFER , under the bridge .</l>
       <l n="2">Ha ! ha !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>GUIDE . I showed you in the valley a bowlder Marked with the imprint of his shoulder ; As he was bearing it up this way , A peasant , passing , cried , “ Herr Je ! And the Devil dropped it in his fright , And vanished suddenly out of sight !</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">LUCIFER , under the bridge .</l>
       <l n="2">Ha ! ha !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>GUIDE . Abbot Giraldus of Einsiedel , For pilgrims on their way to Rome , Built this at last , with a single arch , Under which , on its endless march , Runs the river , white with foam , Like a thread through the eye of a needle . And the Devil promised to let it stand , Under compact and condition That the first living thing which crossed Should be surrendered into his hand , And be beyond redemption lost .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">LUCIFER , under the bridge .</l>
       <l n="2">Ha ! ha ! perdition !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>GUIDE . At length , the bridge being all completed , The Abbot , standing at its head , Threw across it a loaf of bread , Which a hungry dog sprang after ; And the rocks re-echoed with the peals of laughter , To see the Devil thus defeated !</p>
     <p>They pass on .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">LUCIFER , under the bridge .</l>
       <l n="2">Ha ! ha ! defeated !</l>
       <l n="3">For journeys and for crimes like this</l>
       <l n="4">I let the bridge stand o'er the abyss !</l>

     <p>THE ST. GOTHARD PASS</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . This is the highest point . Two ways the rivers Leap down to different seas , and as they roll Grow deep and still , and their majestic presence Becomes a benefaction to the towns They visit , wandering silently among them , Like patriarchs old among their shining tents .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . How bleak and bare it is ! Nothing but mosses Grow on these rocks .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Yet are they not forgotten ; Beneficent Nature sends the mists to feed them .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . See yonder little cloud , that , borne aloft So tenderly by the wind , floats fast away Over the snowy peaks ! It seems to me The body of St. Catherine , borne by angels !</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Thou art St. Catherine , and invisible angels Bear thee across these chasms and precipices , Lest thou shouldst dash thy feet against a stone !</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Would I were borne unto my grave , as she was , Upon angelic shoulders ! Even now I seem uplifted by them , light as air ! What sound is that ?</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . The tumbling avalanches !</p>
     <p>ELSIE . How awful , yet how beautiful !</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . These are The voices of the mountains ! Thus they ope Their snowy lips , and speak unto each other , In the primeval language , lost to man .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . What land is this that spreads itself beneath us ?</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Italy ! Italy !</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Land of the Madonna ! How beautiful it is ! It seems a garden Of Paradise !</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Nay , of Gethsemane To thee and me , of passion and of prayer ! Yet once of Paradise . Long years ago I wandered as a youth among its bowers , And never from my heart has faded quite Its memory , that , like a summer sunset , Encircles with a ring of purple light All the horizon of my youth .</p>
     <p>GUIDE . O friends ! The days are short , the way before us long : We must not linger , if we think to reach The inn at Belinzona before vespers !</p>
     <p>They pass on .</p>

       <l n="1">A halt under the trees at noon .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Here let us pause a moment in the trembling Shadow and sunshine of the roadside trees , And , our tired horses in a group assembling , Inhale long draughts of this delicious breeze . Our fleeter steeds have distanced our attendants ; They lag behind us with a slower pace ; We will await them under the green pendants Of the great willows in this shady place . Ho , Barbarossa ! how thy mottled haunches Sweat with this canter over hill and glade ! Stand still , and let these overhanging branches Fan thy hot sides and comfort thee with shade !</p>
     <p>ELSIE . What a delightful landscape spreads before us , Marked with a whitewashed cottage here and there ! And , in luxuriant garlands drooping o'er us , Blossoms of grape-vines scent the sunny air .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Hark ! what sweet sounds are those , whose accents holy Fill the warm noon with music sad and sweet !</p>
     <p>ELSIE . It is a band of pilgrims , moving slowly On their long journey , with uncovered feet .</p>

     <p>PRINCE HENRY . If from the outward man we judge the inner , And cleanliness is godliness , I fear A hopeless reprobate , a hardened Sinner , Must be that Carmelite now passing near .</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . There is my German Prince again , Thus far on his journey to Salern , And the lovesick girl , whose heated brain Is sowing the cloud to reap the rain ; But it 's a long road that has no turn ! Let them quietly hold their way , I have also a part in the play . But first I must act to my heart 's content This mummery and this merriment , And drive this motley flock of sheep Into the fold , where drink and sleep The jolly old friars of Benevent . Of a truth , it often provokes me to laugh To see these beggars hobble along , Lamed and maimed , and fed upon chaff , Chanting their wonderful puff and paff , And , to make up for not understanding the song , Singing it fiercely , and wild , and strong ! Were it not for my magic garters and staff , And the goblets of goodly wine I quaff , And the mischief I make in the idle throng , I should not continue the business long .</p>

     <p>ELSIE . It is the same who , on the Strasburg square , Preached to the people in the open air .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . And he has crossed o'er mountain , field , and fell , On that good steed , that seems to bear him well , The hackney of the Friars of Orders Gray , His own stout legs ! He , too , was in the play , Both as King Herod and Ben Israel . Good morrow , Friar !</p>
     <p>FRIAR CUTHBERT . Good morrow , noble Sir !</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . I speak in German , for , unless I err , You are a German .</p>
     <p>FRIAR CUTHBERT . I cannot gainsay you . But by what instinct , or what secret sign , Meeting me here , do you straightway divine That northward of the Alps my country lies ?</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Your accent , like St. Peter 's , would betray you , Did not your yellow beard and your blue eyes . Moreover , we have seen your face before , And heard you preach at the Cathedral door On Easter Sunday , in the Strasburg square . We were among the crowd that gathered there , And saw you play the Rabbi with great skill , As if , by leaning o'er so many years To walk with little children , your own will Had caught a childish attitude from theirs , A kind of stooping in its form and gait , And could no longer stand erect and straight . Whence come you now ?</p>
     <p>FRIAR CUTHBERT . From the old monastery Of Hirschau , in the forest ; being sent Upon a pilgrimage to Benevent , To see the image of the Virgin Mary , That moves its holy eyes , and sometimes speaks , And lets the piteous tears run down its cheeks , To touch the hearts of the impenitent .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Oh , had I faith , as in the days gone by , That knew no doubt , and feared no mystery !</p>

       <l n="2">Ho , Cuthbert ! Friar Cuthbert !</l>

     <p>FRIAR CUTHBERT . Fare well , Prince ; I cannot stay to argue and convince .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . This is indeed the blessed Mary 's land , Virgin and mother of our dear redeemer ! All hearts are touched and softened at her name , Alike the bandit , with the bloody hand , The priest , the prince , the scholar , and the peasant , The man of deeds , the visionary dreamer , Pay homage to her as one ever present ! And even as children , who have much offended A too indulgent father , in great shame , Penitent , and yet not daring unattended To go into his presence , at the gate Speak with their sister , and confiding wait Till she goes in before and intercedes ; So men , repenting of their evil deeds , And yet not venturing rashly to draw near With their requests an angry father 's ear , Offer to her their prayers and their confession , And she for them in heaven makes intercession . And if our faith had given us nothing more Than this example of all womanhood , So mild , so merciful , so strong , so good , So patient , peaceful , loyal , loving , pure , This were enough to prove it higher and truer Than all the creeds the world had known before .</p>

     <p>PRINCE HENRY . It is the sea , it is the sea , In all its vague immensity , Fading and darkening in the distance ! Silent , majestical , and slow , The white ships haunt it to and fro , With all their ghostly sails unfurled , As phantoms from another world Haunt the dim confines of existence ! But ah ! how few can comprehend Their signals , or to what good end From land to land they come and go ! Upon a sea more vast and dark The spirits of the dead embark , All voyaging to unknown coasts . We wave our farewells from the shore , And they depart , and come no more , Or come as phantoms and as ghosts .</p>

     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Angel of God ! thy finer sense perceives Celestial and perpetual harmonies ! Thy purer soul , that trembles and believes , Hears the archangel 's trumpet in the breeze , And where the forest rolls , or ocean heaves , Cecilia 's organ sounding in the seas , And tongues of prophets speaking in the leaves . But I hear discord only and despair , And whispers as of demons in the air !</p>
     <p>AT SEA</p>
     <p>IL PADRONE . The wind upon our quarter lies , And on before the freshening gale , That fills the snow-white lateen sail , Swiftly our light felucca flies , Around the billows burst and foam ; They lift her o'er the sunken rock , They beat her sides with many a shock , And then upon their flowing dome They poise her , like a weathercock ! Between us and the western skies The hills of Corsica arise ; Eastward in yonder long blue line , The summits of the Apennine , And southward , and still far away , Salerno , on its sunny bay . You cannot see it , where it lies .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Ah , would that never more mine eyes Might see its towers by night or day !</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Behind us , dark and awfully , There comes a cloud out of the sea , That bears the form of a hunted deer , With hide of brown , and hoofs of black And antlers laid upon its back , And fleeing fast and wild with fear , As if the hounds were on its track !</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Lo ! while we gaze , it breaks and falls In shapeless masses , like the walls Of a burnt city . Broad and red The flies of the descending sun Glare through the windows , and o'erhead , Athwart the vapors , dense and dun , Long shafts of silvery light arise , Like rafters that support the skies !</p>
     <p>ELSIE . See ! from its summit the lurid levin Flashes downward without warning , As Lucifer , son of the morning , Fell from the battlements of heaven !</p>
     <p>IL PADRONE . I must entreat you , friends , below ! The angry storm begins to blow , For the weather changes with the moon . All this morning , until noon , We had baffling winds , and sudden flaws Struck the sea with their cat'shYpppHeNpaws . Only a little hour ago I was whistling to Saint Antonio For a capful of wind to fill our sail , And instead of a breeze he has sent a gale . Last night I saw St. Elmo 's stars , With their glimmering lanterns , all at play On the tops of the masts and the tips of the spars , And I knew we should have foul weather to-day . Cheerily , my hearties ! yo heave ho ! Brail up the mainsail , and let her go As the winds will and Saint Antonio !</p>

       <l n="2">College .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>SCHOLASTIC . There , that is my gauntlet , my banner , my shield , Hung up as a challenge to all the field ! One hundred and twenty-five propositions , Which I will maintain with the sword of the tongue Against all disputants , old and young . Let us see if doctors or dialecticians Will dare to dispute my definitions , Or attack any one of my learned theses . Here stand I ; the end shall be as God pleases . I think I have proved , by profound researches , The error of all those doctrines so vicious Of the old Areopagite Dionysius , That are making such terrible work in the churches , By Michael the Stammerer sent from the East , And done into Latin by that Scottish beast , Johannes Duns Scotus , who dares to maintain , In the face of the truth , the error infernal , That the universe is and must be eternal ; At first laying down , as a fact fundamental , That nothing with God can be accidental ; Then asserting that God before the creation Could not have existed , because it is plain That , had He existed , He would have created ; Which is begging the question that should be debated , And moveth me less to anger than laughter . All nature , he holds , is a respiration Of the Spirit of God , who , in breathing , hereafter Will inhale it into his bosom again , So that nothing but God alone will remain . And therein he contradicteth himself ; For he opens the whole discussion by stating , That God can only exist in creating . That question I think I have laid on the shelf !</p>
     <p>He goes out . Two Doctors come in disputing , and followed by pupils .</p>
     <p>DOCTOR SERAFINO . I , with the Doctor Seraphic , maintain , That a word which is only conceived in the brain Is a type of eternal Generation ; The spoken word is the Incarnation .</p>
     <p>DOCTOR CHERUBINO . What do I care for the Doctor Seraphic , With all his wordy chaffer and traffic ?</p>
     <p>DOCTOR SERAFINO . You make but a paltry show of resistance ; Universals have no real existence !</p>
     <p>DOCTOR CHERUBINO . Your words are but idle and empty chatter ; Ideas are eternally joined to matter !</p>
     <p>DOCTOR SERAFINO . May the Lord have mercy on your position , You wretched , wrangling culler of herbs !</p>
     <p>DOCTOR CHERUBINO . May he send your soul to eternal perdition , For your Treatise on the Irregular verbs !</p>
     <p>They rush out fighting . Two Scholars come in .</p>
     <p>FIRST SCHOLAR . Monte Cassino , then , is your College . What think you of ours here at Salern ?</p>
     <p>SECOND SCHOLAR . To tell the truth , I arrived so lately , I hardly yet have had time to discern . So much , at least , I am bound to acknowledge : The air seems healthy , the buildings stately , And on the whole I like it greatly .</p>
     <p>FIRST SCHOLAR . Yes , the air is sweet ; the Calabrian hills Send us down puffs of mountain air ; And in summer-time the sea-breeze fills With its coolness cloister , and court , and square . Then at every season of the year There are crowds of guests and travellers here ; Pilgrims , and mendicant friars , and traders From the Levant , with figs and wine , And bands of wounded and sick Crusaders , Coming back from Palestine .</p>
     <p>SECOND SCHOLAR . And what are the studies you pursue ? What is the course you here go through ?</p>
     <p>FIRST SCHOLAR . The first three years of the college course Are given to Logic alone , as the source Of all that is noble , and wise , and true .</p>
     <p>SECOND SCHOLAR . That seems rather strange , I must confess , In a Medical School ; yet , nevertheless , You doubtless have reasons for that .</p>
     <p>FIRST SCHOLAR . Oh yes For none but a clever dialectician Can hope to become a great physician ; That has been settled long ago . Logic makes an important part Of the mystery of the healing art ; For without it how could you hope to show That nobody knows so much as you know ? After this there are five years more Devoted wholly to medicine , With lectures on chirurgical lore , And dissections of the bodies of swine , As likest the human form divine .</p>
     <p>SECOND SCHOLAR . What are the books now most in vogue ?</p>
     <p>FIRST SCHOLAR . Quite an extensive catalogue ; Mostly , however , books of our own ; As Gariopontus ’ Passionarius , And the writings of Matthew Platearius ; And a volume universally known As the Regimen of the School of Salern , For Robert of Normandy written in terse And very elegant Latin verse . Each of these writings has its turn . And when at length we have finished these Then comes the struggle for degrees , Will all the oldest and ablest critics ; The public thesis and disputation , Question , and answer , and explanation Of a passage out of Hippocrates , Or Aristotle 's Analytics . There the triumphant Magister stands ! A book is solemnly placed in his hands , On which he swears to follow the rule And ancient forms of the good old School ; To report if any confectionarius Mingles his drugs with matters various , And to visit his patients twice a day , And once in the night , if they live in town , And if they are poor , to take no pay . Having faithfully promised these , His head is crowned with a laurel crown ; A kiss on his cheek , a ring on his hand , The Magister Artium et Physices Goes forth from the school like a lord of the land . And now , as we have the whole morning before us , Let us go in , if you make no objection , And listen awhile to a learned prelection On Marcus Aurelius Cassioderus .</p>
     <p>They go in . Enter Lucifer as a Doctor .</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . This is the great School of Salern ! A land of wrangling and of quarrels , Of brains that seethe , and hearts that burn , Where every emulous scholar hears , In every breath that comes to his ears , The rustling of another 's laurels ! The air of the place is called salubrious ; The neighborhood of Vesuvius lends it Au odor volcanic , that rather mends it , And the building 's have an aspect lugubrious , That inspires a feeling of awe and terror Into the heart of the beholder . And befits such an ancient homestead of error , Where the old falsehoods moulder and smoulder , And yearly by many hundred hands Are carried away in the zeal of youth , And sown like tares in the field of truth , To blossom and ripen in other lands .</p>

     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Then you know our purpose . I am Prince Henry of Hoheneck , and this The maiden that I spake of in my letters .</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . It is a very grave and solemn business ! We must nor be precipitate . Does she Without compulsion , of her own free will , Consent to this ?</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Against all opposition , Against all prayers , entreaties , protestations , She will not be persuaded .</p>
     <p>LUCIFER . That is strange ! Have you thought well of it ?</p>
     <p>ELSIE . I come not here To argue , but to die . Your business is not To question , but to kill me . I am ready , I am impatient to be gone from here Ere any thoughts of earth disturb again The spirit of tranquillity within me .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Would I had not come here ! Would I were dead , And thou wert in thy cottage in the forest , And hadst not known me ! Why have I done this ? Let me go back and die .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . It cannot be ; Not if these cold , flat stones on which we tread Were coulters heated white , and yonder gateway Flamed like a furnace with a sevenfold heat . I must fulfil my purpose .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . I forbid it ! Not one step further . For I only meant To put thus far thy courage to the proof . It is enough . I , too , have strength to die , For thou hast taught me !</p>
     <p>ELSIE . O my Prince ! remember Your promises . Let me fulfil my errand . You do not look on life and death as I do . There are two angels , that attend unseen Each one of us , and in great books record Our good and evil deeds . He who writes down The good ones , after every action closes His volume , and ascends with it to God . The other keeps his dreadful day-book open Till sunset , that we may repent ; which doing , The record of the action fades away , And leaves a line of white across the page . Now if my act be good , as I believe , It cannot be recalled . It is already Sealed up in heaven , as a good deed accomplished . The rest is yours . Why wait you ? I am ready .</p>

       <l n="1">URSULA spinning . A summer afternoon . A table spread .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>URSULA . I have marked it well ,— it must be true ,— Death never takes one alone , but two ! Whenever he enters in at a door , Under roof of gold or roof of thatch , He always leaves it upon the latch , And comes again ere the year is o'er . Never one of a household only ! Perhaps it is a mercy of God , Lest the dead there under the sod , In the land of strangers , should be lonely ! Ah me ! I think I am lonelier here ! It is hard to go ,— but harder to stay ! Were it not for the children , I should pray That Death would take me within the year ! And Gottlieb !— he is at work all day , In the sunny field , or the forest murk , But I know that his thoughts are far away , I know that his heart is not in his work ! And when he comes home to me at night He is not cheery , but sits and sighs , And I see the great tears in his eyes , And try to be cheerful for his sake . Only the children 's hearts are light . Mine is weary , and ready to break . God help us ! I hope we have done right ; We thought we were acting for the best !</p>

     <p>URSULA . This is his farm , and I his wife . Pray sit . What may your business be ?</p>
     <p>FORESTER . News from the Prince !</p>
     <p>URSULA . Of death or life ?</p>
     <p>FORESTER . You put your questions eagerly !</p>
     <p>URSULA . Answer me , then ! How is the Prince ?</p>
     <p>FORESTER . I left him only two hours since Homeward returning down the river , As strong and well as if God , the Giver , Had given him back his youth again .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">URSULA , despairing .</l>
       <l n="2">Then Elsie , my poor child , is dead !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>FORESTER . That , my good woman , I have not said . Do n't cross the bridge till you come to it , Is a proverb old , and of excellent wit .</p>
     <p>URSULA . Keep me no longer in this pain !</p>
     <p>FORESTER . It is true your daughter is no more ;— That is , the peasant she was before .</p>
     <p>URSULA . Alas ! I am simple and lowly bred , I am poor , distracted , and forlorn . And it is not well that you of the court Should mock me thus , and make a sport Of a joyless mother whose child is dead , For you , too , were of mother born !</p>
     <p>FORESTER . Your daughter lives , and the Prince is well ! You will learn erelong how it all befell . Her heart for a moment never failed ; But when they reached Salerno 's gate , The Prince 's nobler self prevailed , And saved her for a noble fate . And he was healed , in his despair , By the touch of St. Matthew 's sacred bones ; Though I think the long ride in the open air , That pilgrimage over stocks and stones , In the miracle must come in for a share .</p>
     <p>URSULA . Virgin ! who lovest the poor and lowly , If the loud cry of a mother 's heart Can ever ascend to where thou art , Into thy blessed hands and holy Receive my prayer of praise and thanksgiving ! Let the hands that bore our Saviour bear it Into the awful presence of God ; For thy feet with holiness are shod , And if thou hearest it He will hear it . Our child who was dead again is living !</p>
     <p>FORESTER . I did not tell you she was dead ; If you thought so ‘ t was no fault of mine ; At this very moment while I speak , They are sailing homeward down the Rhine , In a splendid barge , with golden prow , And decked with banners white and red As the colors on your daughter 's cheek . They call her the Lady Alicia now ; For the Prince in Salerno made a vow That Elsie only would he wed .</p>
     <p>URSULA . Jesu Maria ! what a change ! All seems to me so weird and strange !</p>
     <p>FORESTER . I saw her standing on the deck , Beneath an awning cool and shady ; Her cap of velvet could not hold The tresses of her hair of gold , That flowed and floated like the stream , And fell in masses down her neck . As fair and lovely did she seem As in a story or a dream Some beautiful and foreign lady . And the Prince looked so grand and proud , And waved his hand thus to the crowd That gazed and shouted from the shore , All down the river , long and loud .</p>
     <p>URSULA . We shall behold our child once more ; She is not dead ! She is not dead ! God , listening , must have overheard The prayers , that , without sound or word , Our hearts in secrecy have said ! Oh , bring me to her ; for mine eyes Are hungry to behold her face ; My very soul within me cries ; My very hands seem to caress her , To see her , gaze at her , and bless her ; Dear Elsie , child of God and grace !</p>
     <p>Goes out toward the garden .</p>
     <p>FORESTER . There goes the good woman out of her head ; And Gottlieb 's supper is waiting here ; A very capacious flagon of beer , And a very portentous loaf of bread . One would say his grief did not much oppress him . Here 's to the health of the Prince , God bless him !</p>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . We are alone . The wedding guests Ride down the hill , with plumes and cloaks , And the descending dark invests The Niederwald , and all the nests Among its hoar and haunted oaks .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . What bells are those , that ring so slow , So mellow , musical , and low ?</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . They are the bells of Geisenheim , That with their melancholy chime Ring out the curfew of the sun .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Listen , beloved .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . They are done ! Dear Elsie ! many years ago Those same soft bells at eventide Rang in the ears of Charlemagne , As , seated by Fastrada 's side At Ingelheim , in all his pride He heard their sound with secret pain .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Their voices only speak to me Of peace and deep tranquillity , And endless confidence in thee !</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Thou knowest the story of her ring , How , when the court went back to Aix , Fastrada died ; and how the king Sat watching by her night and day , Till into one of the blue lakes , Which water that delicious land , They cast the ring , drawn from her hand : And the great monarch sat serene And sad beside the fated shore , Nor left the land forevermore .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . That was true love .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . For him the queen Ne'er did what thou hast done for me .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Wilt thou as fond and faithful be ? Wilt thou so love me after death ?</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . In life 's delight , in death 's dismay , In storm and sunshine , night and day , In health , in sickness , in decay , Here and hereafter , I am thine ! Thou hast Fastrada 's ring . Beneath the calm , blue waters of thine eyes , Deep in thy steadfast soul it lies , And , undisturbed by this world 's breath , With magic light its jewels shine ! This golden ring , which thou hast worn Upon thy finger since the morn , Is but a symbol and a semblance , An outward fashion , a remembrance , Of what thou wearest within unseen , O my Fastrada , O my queen ! Behold ! the hill-trips all aglow With purple and with amethyst ; While the whole valley deep below Is filled , and seems to overflow , With a fast-rising tide of mist . The evening air grows damp and chill ; Let us go in .</p>
     <p>ELSIE . Ah , not so soon . See yonder fire ! It is the moon Slow rising o'er the eastern hill . It glimmers on the forest tips And through the dewy foliage drips In little rivulets of light , And makes the heart in love with night .</p>
     <p>PRINCE HENRY . Oft on this terrace , when the day Was closing , have I stood and gazed , And seen the landscape fade away , And the white vapors rise and drown Hamlet and vineyard , tower and town , While far above the hill-tops blazed . But then another hand than thine Was gently held and clasped in mine ; Another head upon my breast Was laid , as thine is now , at rest . Why dost thou lift those tender eyes With so much sorrow and surprise ? A minstrel 's , not a maiden 's hand , Was that which in my own was pressed , A manly form usurped thy place , A beautiful , but bearded face , That now is in the Holy Land , Yet in my memory from afar Is shining on us like a star . But linger not . For while I speak , A sheeted spectre white and tall , The cold mist climbs the castle wall , And lays his hand upon thy cheek !</p>
     <p>They go in .</p>

       <l n="10">I heard a great voice from the temple saying</l>
       <l n="11">Unto the Seven Angels , Go your ways ;</l>
       <l n="12">Pour out the vials of the wrath of God</l>
       <l n="13">Upon the earth . And the First Angel went</l>
       <l n="14">And poured his vial on the earth ; and straight</l>
       <l n="15">There fell a noisome and a grievous sore</l>
       <l n="16">On them which had the birth-mark of the Beast ,</l>
       <l n="17">And them which worshipped and adored his image .</l>
       <l n="18">On us hath fallen this grievous pestilence .</l>
       <l n="19">There is a sense of terror in the air ;</l>
       <l n="20">And apparitions of things horrible</l>
       <l n="21">Are seen by many ; from the sky above us</l>
       <l n="22">The stars fall ; and beneath us the earth quakes !</l>
       <l n="23">The sound of drums at midnight from afar ,</l>
       <l n="24">The sound of horsemen riding to and fro ,</l>
       <l n="25">As if the gates of the invisible world</l>
       <l n="26">Were opened , and the dead came forth to warn us ,—</l>
       <l n="27">All these are omens of some dire disaster</l>
       <l n="28">Impending over us , and soon to fall ,</l>
       <l n="29">Moreover , in the language of the Prophet ,</l>
       <l n="30">Death is again come up into our windows ,</l>
       <l n="31">To cut off little children from without ,</l>
       <l n="32">And young men from the streets . And in the midst</l>
       <l n="33">Of all these supernatural threats and warnings</l>
       <l n="34">Doth Heresy uplift its horrid head ;</l>
       <l n="35">A vision of Sin more awful and appalling</l>
       <l n="36">Than any phantasm , ghost , or apparition ,</l>

     <p>EDITH . Yet the women prayed And prophesied at Corinth in his day ; And , among those on whom the fiery tongues Of Pentecost descended , some were women !</p>
     <p>NORTON . The Elders of the Churches , by our law , Alone have power to open the doors of speech And silence in the Assembly . I command you !</p>
     <p>EDITH . The law of God is greater than your laws ! Ye build your church with blood , your town with crime ; The heads thereof give judgment for reward ; The priests thereof teach only for their hire ; Your laws condemn the innocent to death ; And against this I bear my testimony !</p>
     <p>NORTON . What testimony ?</p>
     <p>EDITH . That of the Holy Spirit , Which , as your Calvin says , surpasseth reason .</p>
     <p>NORTON . The laborer is worthy of his hire .</p>
     <p>EDITH . Yet our great Master did not teach for hire , And the Apostles without purse or scrip Went forth to do his work . Behold this box Beneath thy pulpit . Is it for the poor ? Thou canst not answer . It is for the Priest And against this I bear my testimony .</p>
     <p>NORTON . Away with all these Heretics and Quakers ! Quakers , forsooth ! Because a quaking fell On Daniel , at beholding of the Vision , Must ye needs shake and quake ? Because Isaiah Went stripped and barefoot , must ye wail and howl ? Must ye go stripped and naked ? must ye make A wailing like the dragons , and a mourning As of the owls ? Ye verify the adage That Satan is God 's ape ! Away with them !</p>
     <p>Tumult . The Quakers are driven out with violence , EDITH following slowly . The congregation retires in confusion .</p>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>NORTON . The hand that cut The Red Cross from the colors of the king Can cut the red heart from this heresy . Fear not . All blasphemies immediate And heresies turbulent must be suppressed By civil power .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . But in what way suppressed ?</p>
     <p>NORTON . The Book of Deuteronomy declares That if thy son , thy daughter , or thy wife , Ay , or the friend which is as thine own soul , Entice thee secretly , and say to thee , Let us serve other gods , then shalt thine eye Not pity him , but thou shalt surely kill him , And thine own hand shall be the first upon him To slay him .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . Four already have been slain ; And others banished upon pain of death . But they come back again to meet their doom , Bringing the linen for their winding-sheets . We must not go too far . In truth , I shrink From shedding of more blood . The people murmur At our severity .</p>
     <p>NORTON . Then let them murmur ! Truth is relentless ; justice never wavers ; The greatest firmness is the greatest mercy ; The noble order of the Magistracy Cometh immediately from God , and yet This noble order of the Magistracy Is by these Heretics despised and outraged .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . To-night they sleep in prison . If they die , They cannot say that we have caused their death . We do but guard the passage , with the sword Pointed towards them ; if they dash upon it , Their blood will be on their own heads , not ours .</p>
     <p>NORTON . Enough . I ask no more . My predecessor Coped only with the milder heresies Of Antinomians and of Anabaptists . He was not born to wrestle with these fiends . Chrysostom in his pulpit ; Augustine In disputation ; Timothy in his house ! The lantern of St. Botolph 's ceased to burn When from the portals of that church he came To be a burning and a shining light Here in the wilderness . And , as he lay On his death-bed , he saw me in a vision Ride on a snow-white horse into this town . His vision was prophetic ; thus I came , A terror to the impenitent , and Death On the pale horse of the Apocalypse To all the accursed race of Heretics ! [ Exeunt .</p>

     <p>UPSALL . Good afternoon , Dear neighbor Walter .</p>
     <p>MERRY . Master Nicholas , You have to-day withdrawn yourself from meeting .</p>
     <p>UPSALL . Yea , I have chosen rather to worship God Sitting in silence here at my own door .</p>
     <p>MERRY . Worship the Devil ! You this day have broken Three of our strictest laws . First , by abstaining From public worship . Secondly , by walking Profanely on the Sabbath .</p>
     <p>UPSALL . Not one step . I have been sitting still here , seeing the pigeons Feed in the street and fly about the roofs .</p>
     <p>MERRY . You have been in the street with other intent Than going to and from the Meeting-house . And , thirdly , you are harboring Quakers here . I am amazed !</p>
     <p>UPSALL . Men sometimes , it is said , Entertain angels unawares .</p>
     <p>MERRY . Nice angels ! Angels in broad-brimmed hats and russet cloaks , The color of the Devil 's nutting-bag . They came Into the Meeting-house this afternoon More in the shape of devils than of angels . The women screamed and fainted ; and the boys Made such an uproar in the gallery I could not keep them quiet .</p>
     <p>UPSALL . Neighbor Walter , Your persecution is of no avail .</p>
     <p>MERRY . ‘ T is prosecution , as the Governor says , Not persecution .</p>
     <p>UPSALL . Well , your prosecution ; Your hangings do no good .</p>
     <p>MERRY . The reason is , We do not hang enough . But , mark my words , We 'll scour them ; yea , I warrant ye , we 'll scour them ! And now go in and entertain your angels , And do n't be seen here in the street again Till after sundown ! There they are again !</p>

     <p>SCENE III . — A room in UPSALL 'S house . Night . EDITH , WHARTON , and other Quakers seated at a table . UPSALL seated near them , Several books on the table .</p>
     <p>WHARTON . William and Marmaduke , our martyred brothers , Sleep in untimely graves , if aught untimely Can find place in the providence of God , Where nothing comes too early or too late . I saw their noble death . They to the scaffold Walked hand in hand . Two hundred armed men And many horsemen guarded them , for fear Of rescue by the crowd , whose hearts were stirred .</p>
     <p>EDITH . O holy martyrs !</p>
     <p>WHARTON . When they tried to speak , Their voices by the roll of drums were drowned . When they were dead they still looked fresh and fair , The terror of death was not upon their faces . Our sister Mary , likewise , the meek woman , Has passed through martyrdom to her reward ; Exclaiming , as they led her to her death , “ These many days I 've been in Paradise . ” And , when she died , Priest Wilson threw the hangman His handkerchief , to cover the pale face He dared not look upon .</p>
     <p>EDITH . As persecuted , Yet not forsaken ; as unknown , yet known ; As dying , and behold we are alive ; As sorrowful , and yet rejoicing always ; As having nothing , yet possessing all !</p>
     <p>WHARTON . And Leddra , too , is dead . But from his prison , The day before his death , he sent these words Unto the little flock of Christ : “ What ever May come upon the followers of the Light ,— Distress , affliction , famine , nakedness , Or perils in the city or the sea , Or persecution , or even death itself ,— I am persuaded that God 's armor of Light , As it is loved and lived in , will preserve you . Yea , death itself ; through which you will find entrance Into the pleasant pastures of the fold , Where you shall feed forever as the herds That roam at large in the low valleys of Achor . And as the flowing of the ocean fills Each creek and branch thereof , and then retires , Leaving behind a sweet and wholesome savor ; So doth the virtue and the life of God Flow evermore into the hearts of those Whom He hath made partakers of His nature ; And , when it but withdraws itself a little , Leaves a sweet savor after it , that many Can say they are made clean by every word That He hath spoken to them in their silence . ”</p>

     <p>JOHN ENDICOTT . “ Why dost thou persecute me , Saul of Tarsus ? ” All night these words were ringing in mine ears ! A sorrowful sweet face ; a look that pierced me With meek reproach ; a voice of resignation That had a life of suffering in its tone ; And that was all ! And yet I could not sleep , Or , when I slept , I dreamed that awful dream ! I stood beneath the elm-tree on the Common , On which the Quakers have been hanged , and heard A voice , not hers , that cried amid the darkness , “ This is Aceldama , the field of blood ! I will have mercy , and not sacrifice ! ”</p>

     <p>KEMPTHORN . Come , drink about ! Remember Parson Melham , And bless the man who first invented flip !</p>
     <p>They drink .</p>
     <p>COLE . Pray , Master Kempthorn , where were you last night ?</p>
     <p>KEMPTHORN . On board the Swallow , Simon Kempthorn , master , Up for Barbadoes , and the Windward Islands .</p>
     <p>COLE . The town was in a tumult .</p>
     <p>KEMPTHORN . And for what ?</p>
     <p>COLE . Your Quakers were arrested .</p>
     <p>KEMPTHORN . How my Quakers ?</p>
     <p>COLE . These you brought in your vessel from Barbadoes . They made an uproar in the Meeting-house Yesterday , and they 're now in prison for it . I owe you little thanks for bringing them To the Three Mariners .</p>
     <p>KEMPTHORN . They have not harmed you . I tell you , Goodman Cole , that Quaker girl Is precious as a sea-bream 's eye . I tell you It was a lucky day when first she set Her little foot upon the Swallow 's deck , Bringing good luck , fair winds , and pleasant weather .</p>
     <p>COLE . I am a law-abiding citizen ; I have a seat in the new Meeting-house , A cow-right on the Common ; and , besides , Am corporal in the Great Artillery . I rid me of the vagabonds at once .</p>
     <p>KEMPTHORN . Why should you not have Quakers at your tavern If you have fiddlers ?</p>
     <p>COLE . Never ! never ! never ! If you want fiddling you must go elsewhere , To the Green Dragon and the Admiral Vernon , And other such disreputable places . But the Three Mariners is an orderly house , Most orderly , quiet , and respectable . Lord Leigh said he could be as quiet here As at the Governor 's . And have I not King Charles 's Twelve Good Rules , all framed and glazed , Hanging in my best parlor ?</p>
     <p>KEMPTHORN . Here 's a health To good King Charles . Will you not drink the King ? Then drink confusion to old Parson Palmer .</p>
     <p>COLE . And who is Parson Palmer ? I do n't know him .</p>
     <p>KEMPTHORN . He had his cellar underneath his pulpit , And so preached o'er his liquor , just as you do .</p>

     <p>Enter the MARSHAL , with a proclamation ; and MERRY , with a halberd . They are preceded by a drummer , and followed by the hangman , with an armful of books , and a crowd of people , among whom are UPSALL and JOHN ENDICOTT . A pile is made of the books .</p>

     <p>ENDICOTT . And for the more effectual performance Hereof you are to give security In bonds amounting to one hundred pounds . On your refusal , you will be committed To prison till you do it .</p>
     <p>KEMPTHORN . But you see I cannot do it . The law , sir , of Barbadoes Forbids the landing Quakers on the island .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . Then you will be committed . Who comes next ?</p>
     <p>MERRY . There is another charge against the Captain .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . What is it ?</p>
     <p>MERRY . Profane swearing , please your Worship . He cursed and swore from Dock Square to the Court-house ,</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . Then let him stand in the pillory for one hour .</p>
     <p>[ Exit KEMPTHORN with constable .</p>
     <p>Who 's next ?</p>
     <p>MERRY . The Quakers .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . Call them .</p>
     <p>MERRY . Edward Wharton , Come to the bar !</p>
     <p>WHARTON . Yea , even to the bench .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . Take off your hat .</p>
     <p>WHARTON . My hat offendeth not . If it offendeth any , let him take it ; For I shall not resist .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . Take off his hat . Let him be fined ten shillings for contempt .</p>
     <p>MERRY takes off WHARTON 'S hat .</p>
     <p>WHARTON . What evil have I done ?</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . Your hair 's too long ; And in not putting off your hat to us You 've disobeyed and broken that commandment Which sayeth “ Honor thy father and thy mother . ”</p>
     <p>WHARTON . John Endicott , thou art become too proud ; And loved him who putteth off the hat , And honoreth thee by bowing of the body , And sayeth “ Worshipful sir ! ” ‘ T is time for thee To give such follies over , for thou mayest Be drawing very near unto thy grave .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . Now , sirrah , leave your canting . Take the oath .</p>
     <p>WHARTON . Nay , sirrah me no sirrahs !</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . Will you swear ?</p>
     <p>WHARTON . Nay , I will not .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . You made a great disturbance And uproar yesterday in the Meeting-house , Having your hat on .</p>
     <p>WHARTON . I made no disturbance ; For peacefully I stood , like other people . I spake no words ; moved against none my hand ; But by the hair they haled me out , and dashed Their hooks into my face .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . You , Edward Wharton , On pain of death , depart this Jurisdiction Within ten days . Such is your sentence . Go .</p>
     <p>WHARTON . John Endicott , it had been well for thee If this day 's doings thou hadst left undone But , banish me as far as thou hast power , Beyond the guard and presence of my God Thou canst not banish me .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . Depart the Court ; We have no time to listen to your babble . Who 's next ? [ Exit WHARTON .</p>
     <p>MERRY . This woman , for the same offence .</p>
     <p>EDITH comes forward .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . What is your name ?</p>

     <p>EDITH . Every day Is the Lords Day . It runs through all our lives , As through the pages of the Holy Bible , “ Thus saith the Lord . ”</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . You are accused of making An horrible disturbance , and affrighting The people in the Meeting-house on Sunday . What answer make you ?</p>
     <p>EDITH . I do not deny That I was present in your Steeple-house On the First Day ; but I made no disturbance .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . Why came you there ?</p>
     <p>EDITH . Because the Lord commanded . His word was in my heart , a burning fire Shut up within me and consuming me , And I was very weary with forbearing ; I could not stay .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . ‘ T was not the Lord that sent you ; As an incarnate devil did you come !</p>
     <p>EDITH . On the First Day , when , seated in my chamber , I heard the bells toll , calling you together , The sound struck at my life , as once at his , The holy man , our Founder , when he heard The far-off bells toll in the Vale of Beavor . It sounded like a market bell to call The folk together , that the Priest might set His wares to sale . And the Lord said within me , “ Thou must go cry aloud against that Idol , And all the worshippers thereof . ” I went Barefooted , clad in sackcloth , and I stood And listened at the threshold ; and I heard The praying and the singing and the preaching , Which were but outward forms , and without power . Then rose a cry within me , and my heart Was filled with admonitions and reproofs . Remembering how the Prophets and Apostles Denounced the covetous hirelings and diviners , I entered in , and spake the words the Lord Commanded me to speak . I could no less .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . Are you a Prophetess ?</p>
     <p>EDITH . Is it not written , “ Upon my handmaidens will I pour out My spirit , and they shall prophesy ” ?</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . Enough ; For out of your own mouth are you condemned ! Need we hear further ?</p>
     <p>THE JUDGES . We are satisfied .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . It is sufficient . Edith Christison , The sentence of the Court is , that you be Scourged in three towns , with forty stripes save one , Then banished upon pain of death !</p>
     <p>EDITH . Your sentence Is truly no more terrible to me Than had you blown a feather into the the air , And , as it fell upon me , you had said , Take heed it hurt thee not ! God 's will he done !</p>

     <p>CHRISTISON . I come to warn you that you shed no more The blood of innocent men ! It cries aloud For vengeance to the Lord !</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . Your life is forfeit Unto the law ; and you shall surely die , And shall not live .</p>
     <p>CHRISTISON . Like unto Eleazer , Maintaining the excellence of ancient years And the honor of his gray head , I stand before you ; Like him disdaining all hypocrisy , Lest , through desire to live a little longer , I get a stain to my old age and name !</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . Being in banishment , on pain of death , You come now in among us in rebellion .</p>
     <p>CHRISTISON . I come not in among you in rebellion , But in obedience to the Lord of heaven . Not in contempt to any Magistrate , But only in the love I bear your souls , As ye shall know hereafter , when all men Give an account of deeds done in the body ! God 's righteous judgments ye cannot escape .</p>
     <p>ONE OF THE JUDGES . Those who have gone before you said the same , And yet no judgment of the Lord hath fallen Upon us .</p>
     <p>CHRISTISON . He but waiteth till the measure Of your iniquities shall be filled up , And ye have run your race . Then will his wrath Descend upon you to the uttermost ! For thy part , Humphrey Atherton , it hangs Over thy head already . It shall come Suddenly , as a thief doth in the night , And in the hour when least thou thinkest of it !</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . We have a law , and by that law you die .</p>
     <p>CHRISTISON . I , a free man of England and freeborn , Appeal unto the laws of mine own nation !</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . There 's no appeal to England from this Court ! What ! do you think our statutes are but paper ? Are but dead leaves that rustle in the wind ? Or litter to be trampled under foot ? What say ye , Judges of the Court ,— what say ye ? Shall this man suffer death ? Speak your opinions .</p>
     <p>ONE OF THE JUDGES . I am a mortal man , and die I must , And that erelong ; and I must then appear Before the awful judgment-seat of Christ , To give account of deeds done in the body . My greatest glory on that day will be , That I have given my vote against this man .</p>
     <p>CHRISTISON . If , Thomas Danforth , thou hast nothing more To glory in upon that dreadful day Than blood of innocent people , then thy glory Will be turned into shame ! The Lord hath said it !</p>
     <p>ANOTHER JUDGE . I cannot give consent , while other men Who have been banished upon pain of death Are now in their own houses here among us .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . Ye that will not consent , make record of it . I thank my God that I am not afraid To give my judgment . Wenlock Christison , You must be taken back from hence to prison , Thence to the place of public execution , There to be hanged till you be dead — dead ,— dead .</p>
     <p>CHRISTISON . If ye have power to take my life from me ,— Which I do question ,— God hath power to raise The principle of life in other men , And send them here among you . There shall be No peace unto the wicked , saith my God . Listen , ye Magistrates , for the Lord hath said it ! The day ye put his servitors to death , That day the Day of your own Visitation , The Day of Wrath shall pass above your heads , And ye shall be accursed forevermore !</p>

     <p>SCENE II . — A street . Enter JOHN ENDICOTT and UPSALL .</p>
     <p>JOHN ENDICOTT . Scourged in three towns ! and yet the busy people Go up and down the streets on their affairs Of business or of pleasure , as if nothing Had happened to disturb them or their thoughts ! When bloody tragedies like this are acted , The pulses of a nation should stand still The town should be in mourning , and the people Speak only in low whispers to each other .</p>
     <p>UPSALL . I know this people ; and that underneath A cold outside there burns a secret fire That will find vent and will not be put out , Till every remnant of these barbarous laws Shall be to ashes burned , and blown away .</p>
     <p>JOHN ENDICOTT . Scourged in three towns ! It is incredible Such things can be ! I feel the blood within me Fast mounting in rebellion , since in vain Have I implored compassion of my father !</p>
     <p>UPSALL . You know your father only as a father ; I know him better as a Magistrate . He is a man both loving and severe ; A tender heart ; a will inflexible . None ever loved him more than I have loved him . He is an upright man and a just man In all things save the treatment of the Quakers .</p>
     <p>JOHN ENDICOTT . Yet I have found him cruel and unjust Even as a father . He has driven me forth Into the street ; has shut his door upon me , With words of bitterness . I am as homeless As these poor Quakers are .</p>
     <p>UPSALL . Then come with me . You shall be welcome for your father 's sake , And the old friendship that has been between us . He will relent erelong . A father 's anger Is like a sword without a handle , piercing Both ways alike , and wounding him that wields it No less than him that it is pointed at . [ Exeunt .</p>
     <p>SCENE III . — The prison . Night . EDITH reading the Bible by a lamp .</p>
     <p>EDITH . “ Blessed are ye when men shall persecute you , And shall revile you , and shall say against you All manner of evil falsely for my sake ! Rejoice , and be exceeding glad , for great Is your reward in heaven . For so the prophets , Which were before you , have been persecuted . ”</p>
     <p>Enter JOHN ENDICOTT .</p>
     <p>JOHN ENDICOTT . Edith !</p>
     <p>EDITH . Who is it that speaketh ?</p>
     <p>JOHN ENDICOTT . Saul of Tarsus : As thou didst call me once .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">EDITH ( coming forward ) .</l>
       <l n="2">Yea , I remember .</l>
       <l n="3">Thou art the Governor 's son .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>JOHN ENDICOTT . I am ashamed Thou shouldst remember me .</p>
     <p>EDITH . Why comest thou Into this dark guest-chamber in the night ? What seekest thou ?</p>
     <p>JOHN ENDICOTT . Forgiveness !</p>
     <p>EDITH . I forgive All who have injured me . What hast thou done ?</p>
     <p>JOHN ENDICOTT . I have betrayed thee , thinking that in this I did God service . Now , in deep contrition , I come to rescue thee .</p>
     <p>EDITH . From what ?</p>
     <p>JOHN ENDICOTT . From prison . EDITH . I am safe here within these gloomy walls .</p>
     <p>JOHN ENDICOTT . From scourging in the streets , and in three towns !</p>
     <p>EDITH . Remembering who was scourged for me , I shrink not Nor shudder at the forty stripes save one .</p>
     <p>JOHN ENDICOTT . Perhaps from death itself !</p>
     <p>EDITH . I fear not death , Knowing who died for me .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">JOHN ENDICOTT ( aside ) .</l>
       <l n="2">Surely some divine</l>
       <l n="3">Ambassador is speaking through those lips</l>
       <l n="4">And looking through those eyes ! I cannot answer !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>EDITH . If all these prison doors stood opened wide I would not cross the threshold ,— not one step . There are invisible bars I cannot break ; There are invisible doors that shut me in , And keep me ever steadfast to my purpose .</p>
     <p>JOHN ENDICOTT . Thou hast the patience and the faith of Saints !</p>
     <p>EDITH . Thy Priest hath been with me this day to save me , Not only from the death that comes to all , But from the second death !</p>
     <p>JOHN ENDICOTT . The Pharisee ! My heart revolts against him and his creed ! Alas ! the coat that was without a seam Is rent asunder by contending sects ; Each bears away a portion of the garment , Blindly believing that he has the whole !</p>
     <p>EDITH . When Death , the Healer , shall have touched our eyes With moist clay of the grave , then shall we see The truth as we have never yet beheld it . But he that overcometh shall not be Hurt of the second death . Has he forgotten The many mansions in our father 's house ?</p>
     <p>JOHN ENDICOTT . There is no pity in his iron heart ! The hands that now bear stamped upon their palms The burning sign of Heresy , hereafter Shall be uplifted against such accusers , And then the imprinted letter and its meaning Will not be Heresy , but Holiness !</p>
     <p>EDITH . Remember , thou condemnest thine own father !</p>
     <p>JOHN ENDICOTT . I have no father ! He has cast me off . I am as homeless as the wind that moans And wanders through the streets . Oh , come with me ! Do not delay . Thy God shall be my God , And where thou goest I will go .</p>
     <p>EDITH . I cannot . Yet will I not deny it , nor conceal it ; From the first moment I beheld thy face I felt a tenderness in my soul towards thee . My mind has since been inward to the Lord , Waiting his word . It has not yet been spoken .</p>
     <p>JOHN ENDICOTT . I cannot wait . Trust me . Oh , come with me !</p>
     <p>EDITH . In the next room , my father , an old man , Sitteth imprisoned and condemned to death , Willing to prove his faith by martyrdom ; And thinkest thou his daughter would do less ?</p>
     <p>JOHN ENDICOTT . Oh , life is sweet , and death is terrible !</p>
     <p>EDITH . I have too long walked hand in hand with death To shudder at that pale familiar face . But leave me now . I wish to be alone .</p>
     <p>JOHN ENDICOTT . Not yet . Oh , let me stay .</p>
     <p>EDITH . Urge me no more .</p>
     <p>JOHN ENDICOTT . Alas ! good-night . I will not say good-by !</p>
     <p>EDITH . Put this temptation underneath thy feet . To him that overcometh shall be given The white stone with the new name written on it , That no man knows save him that doth receive it , And I will give thee a new name , and call thee Paul of Damascus , and not Saul of Tarsus .</p>
     <p>[ Exit ENDICOTT . EDITH sits down again to read the Bible .</p>

     <p>GOLDSMITH . First I must pay My duty to the Governor , and take him His letters and despatches . Come with me .</p>

     <p>GOLDSMITH . Hard lines . What for ?</p>
     <p>KEMPTHORN . To take some Quakers back I brought here from Barbadoes in the Swallow . And how to do it I do n't clearly see , For one of them is banished , and another Is sentenced to be hanged ! What shall I do ?</p>
     <p>GOLDSMITH . Just slip your hawser on some cloudy night ; Sheer off , and pay it with the topsail , Simon ! [ Exeunt .</p>

     <p>MERRY . Well , Roxbury and Dorchester must take Their share of shame . She will be whipped in each ! Three towns , and Forty Stripes save one ; that makes Thirteen in each .</p>
     <p>JOHN ENDICOTT . And are we Jews or Christians ? See where she comes , amid a gaping crowd ! And she a child . Oh , pitiful ! pitiful ! There 's blood upon her clothes , her hands , her feet !</p>
     <p>Enter MARSHAL and a drummer . EDITH , stripped to the waist , followed by the hangman with a scourge , and a noisy crowd .</p>
     <p>EDITH . Here let me rest one moment . I am tired . Will some one give me water ?</p>

     <p>ENDICOTT . There is a ship from England has come in , Bringing despatches and much news from home , His majesty was at the Abbey crowned ; And when the coronation was complete There passed a mighty tempest o'er the city , Portentous with great thunderings and lightnings .</p>
     <p>BELLINGHAM . After his father 's , if I well remember , There was an earthquake , that foreboded evil .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . Ten of the Regicides have been put to death ! The bodies of Cromwell , Ireton , and Bradshaw Have been dragged from their graves , and publicly Hanged in their shrouds at Tyburn .</p>
     <p>BELLINGHAM . Horrible !</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . Thus the old tyranny revives again . Its arm is long enough to reach us here , As you will see . For , more insulting still Than flaunting in our faces dead men 's shrouds , Here is the King 's Mandamus , taking from us , From this day forth , all power to punish Quakers .</p>
     <p>BELLINGHAM . That takes from us all power ; we are but puppets , And can no longer execute our laws .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . His Majesty begins with pleasant words , “ Trusty and well-beloved , we greet you well ; ” Then with a ruthless hand he strips from me All that which makes me what I am ; as if From some old general in the field , grown gray In service , scarred with many wounds , Just at the hour of victory , he should strip His badge of office and his well-gained honors , And thrust him back into the ranks again .</p>
     <p>Opens the Mandamus and hands it to BELLINGHAM ; and , while he is reading , ENDICOTT walks up and down the room .</p>

       <l n="7">Or any corporal punishment whatever ,</l>
       <l n="8">Who are imprisoned , or may be obnoxious</l>

     </lg>
     <p>ENDICOTT . It means we shall no longer rule the Province ; It means farewell to law and liberty , Authority , respect for Magistrates , The peace and welfare of the Commonwealth . If all the knaves upon this continent Can make appeal to England , and so thwart The ends of truth and justice by delay , Our power is gone forever . We are nothing But ciphers , valueless save when we follow Some unit ; and our unit is the King ! ‘ T is he that gives us value .</p>
     <p>BELLINGHAM . I confess Such seems to be the meaning of this paper , But being the King 's Mandamus , signed and sealed , We must obey , or we are in rebellion .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . I tell you , Richard Bellingham ,— I tell you , That this is the beginning of a struggle Of which no mortal can foresee the end . I shall not live to fight the battle for you , I am a man disgraced in every way ; This order takes from me my self-respect And the respect of others . ‘ T is my doom , Yes , my death-warrant , but must be obeyed ! Take it , and see that it is executed So far as this , that all be set at large ; But see that none of them be sent to England To bear false witness , and to spread reports That might be prejudicial to ourselves .

     <p>NORTON . Now hear me . This William Brand of yours has tried to beat Our Gospel Ordinances black and blue ; And , if he has been beaten in like manner , It is but justice , and I will appear In his behalf that did so . I suppose That he refused to work .</p>

Alone and lost Here in the forest , there comes over me An inward awfulness . I recall the words Of the Apostle Paul : “ In journeyings often , Often in perils in the wilderness , In weariness , in painfulness , in watchings , In hunger and thirst , in cold and nakedness ; ” And I forget my weariness and pain , My watchings , and my hunger and my thirst . The Lord hath said that He will seek his flock In cloudy and dark days , and they shall dwell Securely in the wilderness , and sleep Safe in the woods ! Whichever way I turn , I come back with my face towards the town . Dimly I see it , and the sea beyond it . O cruel town ! I know what waits me there , And yet I must go back ; for ever louder I hear the inward calling of the Spirit , And must obey the voice . O woods that wear Your golden crown of martyrdom , blood-stained , From you I learn a lesson of submission , And am obedient even unto death , If God so wills it . [ Exit .</p>

     <p>KEMPTHORN . Yes , that 's my name . What 's yours ?</p>
     <p>BUTTER . My name is Butter . I am the treasurer of the Commonwealth .</p>

     <p>KEMPTHORN . Nothing 's the matter with it that I know of . I have seen better , and I have seen worse . The wind 's nor'west . That 's fair for them that sail .</p>
     <p>BUTTER . You need not speak so loud ; I understand you . You sail to-day .</p>
     <p>KEMPTHORN . No , I do n't sail to-day . So , be it fair or foul , it matters not . Say , will you smoke ? There 's choice tobacco here .</p>
     <p>BUTTER . No , thank you . It 's against the law to smoke .</p>
     <p>KEMPTHORN . Then , will you drink ? There 's good ale at this inn .</p>
     <p>BUTTER . No , thank you . It 's against the law to drink .</p>
     <p>KEMPTHORN . Well , almost everything 's against the law In this good town . Give a wide berth to one thing , You 're sure to fetch up soon on something else .</p>
     <p>BUTTER . And so you sail to-day for dear Old England . I am not one of those who think a sup Of this New England air is better worth Than a whole draught of our Old England 's ale .</p>
     <p>KEMPTHORN . Nor I . Give me the ale and keep the air . But , as I said , I do not sail to-day .</p>
     <p>BUTTER . Ah yes ; you sail today .</p>
     <p>KEMPTHORN . I 'm under bonds To take some Quakers back to the Barbadoes ; And one of them is banished , and another Is sentenced to be hanged .</p>
     <p>BUTTER . No , all are pardoned , All are set free by order of the Court ; But some of them would fain return to England . You must not take them . Upon that condition Your bond is cancelled .</p>
     <p>KEMPTHORN . Ah , the wind has shifted ! I pray you , do you speak officially ?</p>
     <p>BUTTER . I always speak officially . To prove it , Here is the bond .</p>
     <p>Rising and giving a paper .</p>
     <p>KEMPTHORN . And here 's my hand upon it , And look you , when I say I 'll do a thing The thing is done . Am I now free to go ?</p>
     <p>BUTTER . What say ?</p>
     <p>KEMPTHORN . I say , confound the tedious man With his strange speaking-trumpet ! Can I go ?</p>
     <p>BUTTER . You 're free to go , by order of the Court . Your servant , sir . [ Exit .</p>

     <p>KEMPTHORN . And yours a thousand times ! [ Exeunt .</p>
     <p>SCENE III . — GOVERNOR ENDICOTT 'S private room . An open window .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT seated in an arm-chair . BELLINGHAM standing near .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . O lost , O loved ! wilt thou return no more ? O loved and lost , and loved the more when lost ! How many men are dragged into their graves By their rebellious children ! I now feel The agony of a father 's breaking heart In David 's cry , “ O Absalom , my son ! ”</p>
     <p>BELLINGHAM . Can you not turn your thoughts a little while To public matters ? There are papers here That need attention .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . Trouble me no more ! My business now is with another world , Ah , Richard Bellingham ! I greatly fear That in my righteous zeal I have been led To doing many things which , left undone , My mind would now be easier . Did I dream it , Or has some person told me , that John Norton Is dead ?</p>
     <p>BELLINGHAM . You have not dreamed it . He is dead , And gone to his reward . It was no dream .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . Then it was very sudden ; for I saw him Standing where you now stand , not long ago .</p>
     <p>BELLINGHAM . By his own fireside , in the afternoon , A faintness and a giddiness came o'er him ; And , leaning on the chimney-piece , he cried , “ The hand of God is on me ! ” and fell dead .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . And did not some one say , or have I dreamed it , That Humphrey Atherton is dead ?</p>
     <p>BELLINGHAM . Alas ! He too is gone , and by a death as sudden . Returning home one evening , at the place Where usually the Quakers have been scourged , His horse took fright , and threw him to the ground , So that his brains were dashed about the street .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . I am not superstitions , Bellingham , And yet I tremble lest it may have been A judgment on him .</p>
     <p>BELLINGHAM . So the people think . They say his horse saw standing in the way The ghost of William Leddra , and was frightened . And furthermore , brave Richard Davenport , The captain of the Castle , in the storm Has been struck dead by lightning .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . Speak no more . For as I listen to your voice it seems As if the Seven Thunders uttered their voices , And the dead bodies lay about the streets Of the disconsolate city ! Bellingham , I did not put those wretched men to death . I did but guard the passage with the sword Pointed towards them , and they rushed upon it ! Yet now I would that I had taken no part In all that bloody work .</p>
     <p>BELLINGHAM . The guilt of it Be on their heads , not ours .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . Are all set free ?</p>
     <p>BELLINGHAM . All are at large .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . And none have been sent back To England to malign us with the King ?</p>
     <p>BELLINGHAM . The ship that brought them sails this very hour , But carries no one back .</p>
     <p>A distant cannon .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . What is that gun ?</p>
     <p>BELLINGHAM . Her parting signal . Through the window there , Look , you can see her sails , above the roofs , Dropping below the Castle , outward bound .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . O white , white , white ! Would that my soul had wings As spotless as those shining sails to fly with ! Now lay this cushion straight . I thank you . Hark ! I thought I heard the hall door open and shut ! I thought I beard the footsteps of my boy !</p>
     <p>BELLINGHAM . It was the wind . There 's no one in the passage .</p>
     <p>ENDICOTT . O Absalom , my son ! I feel the world Sinking beneath me , sinking , sinking , sinking ! Death knocks ! I go to meet him ! Welcome , Death !</p>
     <p>Rises , and sinks back dead ; his head failing aside upon his shoulder .</p>
     <p>BELLINGHAM . O ghastly sight ! Like one who has been hanged ! Endicott ! Endicott ! He makes no answer !</p>
     <p>Raises Endicott 's head .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">He breathes no more ! How bright this signet-ring</l>
       <l n="2">Glitters upon his hand , where he has worn it</l>
       <l n="3">Through such long years of trouble , as if Death</l>
       <l n="4">Had given him this memento of affection ,</l>
       <l n="5">And whispered in his ear , “ Remember me ! ”</l>
       <l n="6">How placid and how quiet is his face ,</l>
       <l n="7">Now that the struggle and the strife are ended</l>
       <l n="8">Only the acrid spirit of the times</l>
       <l n="9">Corroded this true steel . Oh , rest in peace ,</l>
       <l n="10">Courageous heart ! Forever rest in peace !</l>

      <head>ACT I .</head>
       <l n="1">SCENE I . — The woods near Salem Village . Enter TITUBA , with a</l>
       <l n="2">basket of herbs .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>TITUBA . Here 's monk'shYpppHeNhood , that breeds fever in the blood ; And deadly nightshade , that makes men see ghosts ; And henbane , that will shake them with convulsions ; And meadow-saffron and black hellebore , That rack the nerves , and puff the skin with dropsy ; And bitter-sweet , and briony , and eye-bright , That cause eruptions , nosebleed , rheumatisms ; I know them , and the places where they hide In field and meadow ; and I know their secrets , And gather them because they give me power Over all men and women . Armed with these , I , Tituba , an Indian and a slave , Am stronger than the captain with his sword , Am richer than the merchant with his money , Am wiser than the scholar with his books , Mightier than Ministers and Magistrates , With all the fear and reverence that attend them ! For I can fill their bones with aches and pains , Can make them cough with asthma , shake with palsy , Can make their daughters see and talk with ghosts , Or fall into delirium and convulsions ; I have the Evil Eye , the Evil Hand ; A touch from me and they are weak with pain , A look from me , and they consume and die . The death of cattle and the blight of corn , The shipwreck , the tornado , and the fire ,— These are my doings , and they know it not . Thus I work vengeance on mine enemies Who , while they call me slave , are slaves to me !</p>
     <p>Exit TITUBA . Enter MATHER , booted and spurred , with a riding-whip in his hand .</p>
     <p>MATHER . Methinks that I have come by paths unknown Into the land and atmosphere of Witches ; For , meditating as I journeyed on , Lo ! I have lost my way ! If I remember Rightly , it is Scribonius the learned That tells the story of a man who , praying For one that was possessed by Evil Spirits , Was struck by Evil Spirits in the face ; I , journeying to circumvent the Witches , Surely by Witches have been led astray . I am persuaded there are few affairs In which the Devil doth not interfere . We cannot undertake a journey even , But Satan will be there to meddle with it By hindering or by furthering . He hath led me Into this thicket , struck me in the face With branches of the trees , and so entangled The fetlocks of my horse with vines and brambles , That I must needs dismount , and search on foot For the lost pathway leading to the village .</p>
     <p>Re-enter TITUBA .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">What shape is this ? What monstrous apparition ,</l>
       <l n="2">Exceeding fierce , that none may pass that way ?</l>
       <l n="3">Tell me , good woman , if you are a woman —</l>
     </lg>
     <p>TITUBA . I am a woman , but I am not good , I am a Witch !</p>
     <p>MATHER . Then tell me , Witch and woman , For you must know the pathways through this wood , Where lieth Salem Village ?</p>
     <p>TITUBA . Reverend sir , The village is near by . I 'm going there With these few herbs . I 'll lead you . Follow me .</p>
     <p>MATHER . First say , who are you ? I am loath to follow A stranger in this wilderness , for fear Of being misled , and left in some morass . Who are you ?</p>
     <p>TITUBA . I am Tituba the Witch , Wife of John Indian .</p>
     <p>MATHER . You are Tituba ? I know you then . You have renounced the Devil , And have become a penitent confessor , The Lord be praised ! Go on , I 'll follow you . Wait only till I fetch my horse , that stands Tethered among the trees , not far from here .</p>
     <p>TITUBA . Let me get up behind you , reverend sir .</p>
     <p>MATHER . The Lord forbid ! What would the people think , If they should see the Reverend Cotton Mather Ride into Salem with a Witch behind him ? The Lord forbid !</p>
     <p>TITUBA . I do not need a horse ! I can ride through the air upon a stick , Above the tree-tops and above the houses , And no one see me , no one overtake me . [ Exeunt .</p>
     <p>SCENE II . — A room at JUSTICE HATHORNE 'S . A clock in the corner . Enter HATHORNE and MATHER .</p>
     <p>HATHORNE . You are welcome , reverend sir , thrice welcome here Beneath my humble roof .</p>
     <p>MATHER . I thank your Worship .</p>
     <p>HATHORNE . Pray you be seated . You must be fatigued With your long ride through unfrequented woods .</p>
     <p>They sit down .</p>
     <p>MATHER . You know the purport of my visit here ,— To be advised by you , and counsel with you , And with the Reverend Clergy of the village , Touching these witchcrafts that so much afflict you ; And see with mine own eyes the wonders told Of spectres and the shadows of the dead , That come back from their graves to speak with men .</p>
     <p>HATHORNE . Some men there are , I have known such , who think That the two worlds — the seen and the unseen , The world of matter and the world of spirit — Are like the hemispheres upon our maps , And touch each other only at a point . But these two worlds are not divided thus , Save for the purposes of common speech , They form one globe , in which the parted seas All flow together and are intermingled , While the great continents remain distinct .</p>
     <p>MATHER . I doubt it not . The spiritual world Lies all about us , and its avenues Are open to the unseen feet of phantoms That come and go , and we perceive them not , Save by their influence , or when at times A most mysterious Providence permits them To manifest themselves to mortal eyes .</p>
     <p>HATHORNE . You , who are always welcome here among us , Are doubly welcome now . We need your wisdom , Your learning in these things to be our guide . The Devil hath come down in wrath upon us , And ravages the land with all his hosts .</p>
     <p>MATHER . The Unclean Spirit said , “ My name is Legion ! ” Multitudes in the Valley of Destruction ! But when our fervent , well-directed prayers , Which are the great artillery of Heaven , Are brought into the field , I see them scattered And driven like autumn leaves before the wind .</p>
     <p>HATHORNE . You as a Minister of God , can meet them With spiritual weapons : but , alas ! I , as a Magistrate , must combat them With weapons from the armory of the flesh .</p>
     <p>MATHER . These wonders of the world invisible ,— These spectral shapes that haunt our habitations ,— The multiplied and manifold afflictions With which the aged and the dying saints Have their death prefaced and their age imbittered ,— Are but prophetic trumpets that proclaim The Second Coming of our Lord on earth . The evening wolves will be much more abroad , When we are near the evening of the world .</p>
     <p>HATHORNE . When you shall see , as I have hourly seen , The sorceries and the witchcrafts that torment us , See children tortured by invisible spirits , And wasted and consumed by powers unseen , You will confess the half has not been told you .</p>
     <p>MATHER . It must be so . The death-pangs of the Devil Will make him more a Devil than before ; And Nebuchadnezzar 's furnace will be heated Seven times more hot before its putting out .</p>
     <p>HATHORNE . Advise me , reverend sir . I look to you For counsel and for guidance in this matter . What further shall we do ?</p>
     <p>MATHER . Remember this , That as a sparrow falls not to the ground Without the will of God , so not a Devil Can come down from the air without his leave . We must inquire .</p>
     <p>HATHORNE . Dear sir , we have inquired ; Sifted the matter thoroughly through and through , And then resifted it .</p>
     <p>MATHER . If God permits These Evil Spirits from the unseen regions To visit us with surprising informations , We must inquire what cause there is for this , But not receive the testimony borne By spectres as conclusive proof of guilt In the accused .</p>
     <p>HATHORNE . Upon such evidence We do not rest our case . The ways are many In which the guilty do betray themselves .</p>
     <p>MATHER . Be careful . Carry the knife with such exactness , That on one side no innocent blood be shed By too excessive zeal , and on the other No shelter given to any work of darkness .</p>
     <p>HATHORNE . For one , I do not fear excess of zeal . What do we gain by parleying with the Devil ? You reason , but you hesitate to act ! Ah , reverend sir ! believe me , in such cases The only safety is in acting promptly . ‘ T is not the part of wisdom to delay In things where not to do is still to do A deed more fatal than the deed we shrink from . You are a man of books and meditation , But I am one who acts .</p>
     <p>MATHER . God give us wisdom In the directing of this thorny business , And guide us , lest New England should become Of an unsavory and sulphurous odor In the opinion of the world abroad !</p>
     <p>The clock strikes .</p>
     <lg>

       <l n="1">I never hear the striking of a clock</l>

     <p>SCENE III . — A room in WALCOT 'S House . MARY WALCOT seated in an arm-chair . TITUBA with a mirror .</p>
     <p>MARY . Tell me another story , Tituba . A drowsiness is stealing over me Which is not sleep ; for , though I close mine eyes , I am awake , and in another world . Dim faces of the dead and of the absent Come floating up before me ,— floating , fading , And disappearing .</p>
     <p>TITUBA . Look into this glass . What see you ?</p>
     <p>MARY . Nothing but a golden vapor . Yes , something more . An island , with the sea Breaking all round it , like a blooming hedge . What land is this ?</p>
     <p>TITUBA . It is San Salvador , Where Tituba was born . What see you now ?</p>
     <p>MARY . A man all black and fierce .</p>
     <p>TITUBA . That is my father . He was an Obi man , and taught me magic ,— Taught me the use of herbs and images . What is he doing ?</p>

     <p>TITUBA . That is the way the Obi men destroy The people they dislike ! That is the way Some one is wasting and consuming you .</p>
     <p>MARY . You terrify me , Tituba ! Oh , save me From those who make me pine and waste away ! Who are they ? Tell me .</p>
     <p>TITUBA . That I do not know , But you will see them . They will come to you .</p>
     <p>MARY . No , do not let them come ! I cannot bear it ! I am too weak to bear it ! I am dying .</p>
     <p>Fails into a trance .</p>
     <p>TITUBA . Hark ! there is some one coming !</p>
     <p>Enter HATHORNE , MATHER , and WALCOT .</p>
     <p>WALCOT . There she lies , Wasted and worn by devilish incantations ! O my poor sister !</p>
     <p>MATHER . Is she always thus ?</p>
     <p>WALCOT . Nay , she is sometimes tortured by convulsions .</p>
     <p>MATHER . Poor child ! How thin she is ! How wan and wasted !</p>
     <p>HATHORNE . Observe her . She is troubled in her sleep .</p>
     <p>MATHER . Some fearful vision haunts her .</p>
     <p>HATHORNE . You now see With your own eyes , and touch with your own hands , The mysteries of this Witchcraft .</p>
     <p>MATHER . One would need The hands of Briareus and the eyes of Argus To see and touch them all .</p>
     <p>HATHORNE . You now have entered The realm of ghosts and phantoms ,— the vast realm Of the unknown and the invisible , Through whose wide-open gates there blows a wind From the dark valley of the shadow of Death , That freezes us with horror .</p>

     <p>COREY . The Lord hath prospered me . The rising sun Shines on my Hundred Acres and my woods As if he loved them . On a morn like this I can forgive mine enemies , and thank God For all his goodness unto me and mine . My orchard groans with russets and pearmains ; My ripening corn shines golden in the sun ; My barns are crammed with hay , my cattle thrive The birds sing blithely on the trees around me ! And blither than the birds my heart within me . But Satan still goes up and down the earth ; And to protect this house from his assaults , And keep the powers of darkness from my door , This horseshoe will I nail upon the threshold .</p>

     <p>Exit GLOYD and enter MARTHA .</p>
     <p>MARTHA . What is amiss ?</p>
     <p>COREY . The cattle are bewitched . They are broken loose and making for the woods .</p>
     <p>MARTHA . Why will you harbor such delusions , Giles ? Bewitched ? Well , then it was John Gloyd bewitched them ; I saw him even now take down the bars And turn them loose ! They 're only frolicsome .</p>
     <p>COREY . The rascal !</p>
     <p>MARTHA . I was standing in the road , Talking with Goodwife Proctor , and I saw him .</p>
     <p>COREY . With Proctor 's wife ? And what says Goodwife Proctor ?</p>
     <p>MARTHA . Sad things indeed ; the saddest you can hear Of Bridget Bishop . She 's cried out upon !</p>
     <p>COREY . Poor soul ! I 've known her forty year or more . She was the widow Wasselby , and then She married Oliver , and Bishop next . She 's had three husbands . I remember well My games of shovel-board at Bishop 's tavern In the old merry days , and she so gay With her red paragon bodice and her ribbons ! Ah , Bridget Bishop always was a Witch !</p>
     <p>MARTHA . They 'll little help her now ,— her caps and ribbons , And her red paragon bodice and her plumes , With which she flaunted in the Meeting-house ! When next she goes there , it will be for trial .</p>
     <p>COREY . When will that be ?</p>
     <p>MARTHA . This very day at ten .</p>
     <p>COREY . Then get you ready . We 'll go and see it . Come ; you shall ride behind me on the pillion .</p>
     <p>MARTHA . Not I . You know I do not like such things . I wonder you should . I do not believe In Witches nor in Witchcraft .</p>
     <p>COREY . Well , I do . There 's a strange fascination in it all . That draws me on and on . I know not why .</p>
     <p>MARTHA . What do we know of spirits good or ill , Or of their power to help us or to harm us ?</p>
     <p>COREY . Surely what 's in the Bible must be true . Did not an Evil Spirit come on Saul ? Did not the Witch of Endor bring the ghost Of Samuel from his grave ? The Bible says so .</p>
     <p>MARTHA . That happened very long ago .</p>
     <p>COREY . With God There is no long ago .</p>
     <p>MARTHA . There is with us .</p>
     <p>COREY . And Mary Magdalene had seven devils , And he who dwelt among the tombs a legion !</p>
     <p>MARTHA . God 's power is infinite . I do not doubt it . If in His providence He once permitted Such things to be among the Israelites , It does not follow He permits them now , And among us who are not Israelites . But we will not dispute about it , Giles . Go to the village if you think it best , And leave me here ; I 'll go about my work . [ Exit into the house .</p>
     <p>COREY . And I will go and saddle the gray mare . The last word always . That is woman 's nature . If an old man will marry a young wife , He must make up his mind to many things . It 's putting new cloth into an old garment , When the strain comes , it is the old gives way .</p>

     <p>MARTHA comes to the door .</p>
     <p>MARTHA . Oh these old friends and cronies of my husband , These captains from Nantucket and the Cape , That come and turn my house into a tavern With their carousing ! Still , there 's something frank In these seafaring men that makes me like them . Why , here 's a horseshoe nailed upon the doorstep ! Giles has done this to keep away the Witches .

     <p>COREY . All my dear oxen dead . I loved them , Martha , Next to yourself . I liked to look at them , And watch the breath come out of their wide nostrils , And see their patient eyes .

They were my friends ; and when Gloyd came and told me They were all drowned , I could have drowned myself From sheer vexation ; and I said as much To Gloyd and others .</p>
     <p>MARTHA . Do not trust John Gloyd With anything you would not have repeated .</p>
     <p>COREY . As I came through the woods this afternoon , Impatient at my loss , and much perplexed With all that I had heard there in the village , The yellow leaves lit up the trees about me Like an enchanted palace , and I wished I knew enough of magic or of Witchcraft To change them into gold . Then suddenly A tree shook down some crimson leaves upon me , Like drops of blood , and in the path before me Stood Tituba the Indian , the old crone .</p>
     <p>MARTHA . Were you not frightened ?</p>
     <p>COREY . No , I do not think I know the meaning of that word . Why frightened ? I am not one of those who think the Lord Is waiting till He catches them some day In the back yard alone ! What should I fear ? She started from the bushes by the path , And had a basket full of herbs and roots For some witch-broth or other ,— the old hag .</p>
     <p>MARTHA . She has been here to-day .</p>
     <p>COREY . With hand outstretched She said : “ Giles Corey , will you sign the Book ? ” “ Avaunt ! ” I cried : “ Get thee behind me , Satan ! ” At which she laughed and left me . But a voice Was whispering in my ear continually : “ Self-murder is no crime . The life of man Is his , to keep it or to throw away ! ”</p>
     <p>MARTHA . ‘ T was a temptation of the Evil One ! Giles , Giles ! why will you harbor these dark thoughts ?</p>

     <p>COREY . I 'll tell you that to-morrow , not to-night . I 'll go to bed .</p>
     <p>MARTHA . First let us pray together .</p>
     <p>COREY . I cannot pray to-night .</p>
     <p>MARTHA . Say the Lord 's Prayer , And that will comfort you .</p>
     <p>COREY . I cannot say , “ As we forgive those that have sinned against us , ” When I do not forgive them .</p>

       <l n="1">MARTHA ( kneeling on the hearth ) .</l>
       <l n="2">God forgive you !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>COREY . I will not make believe ! I say to-night There 's something thwarts me when I wish to pray , And thrusts into my mind , instead of prayers , Hate and revenge , and things that are not prayers . Something of my old self ,— my old , bad life ,— And the old Adam in me rises up , And will not let me pray . I am afraid The Devil hinders me . You know I say Just what I think , and nothing more nor less , And , when I pray , my heart is in my prayer . I cannot say one thing and mean another . If I can n't pray , I will not make believe !</p>

     <p>MARTHA . I dreamed that you and I were both in prison ; That we had fetters on our hands and feet ; That we were taken before the Magistrates , And tried for Witchcraft , and condemned to death ! I wished to pray ; they would not let me pray ; You tried to comfort me , and they forbade it . But the most dreadful thing in all my dream Was that they made you testify against me ! And then there came a kind of mist between us ; I could not see you ; and I woke in terror . I never was more thankful in my life Than when I found you sleeping at my side !</p>

     <p>SCENE II . — A street in Salem Village . Enter MATHER and HATHORNE .</p>
     <p>MATHER . Yet one thing troubles me .</p>
     <p>HATHORNE . And what is that ?</p>
     <p>MATHER . May not the Devil take the outward shape Of innocent persons ? Are we not in danger , Perhaps , of punishing some who are not guilty ?</p>
     <p>HATHORNE . As I have said , we do not trust alone To spectral evidence .</p>
     <p>MATHER . And then again , If any shall be put to death for Witchcraft , We do but kill the body , not the soul . The Unclean Spirits that possessed them once Live still , to enter into other bodies . What have we gained ? Surely , there 's nothing gained .</p>
     <p>HATHORNE . Doth not the Scripture say , “ Thou shalt not suffer A Witch to live ” ?</p>
     <p>MATHER . The Scripture sayeth it , But speaketh to the Jews ; and we are Christians . What say the laws of England ?</p>
     <p>HATHORNE . They make Witchcraft Felony without the benefit of Clergy . Witches are burned in England . You have read — For you read all things , not a book escapes you — The famous Demonology of King James ?</p>
     <p>MATHER . A curious volume . I remember also The plot of the Two Hundred , with one Fian , The Registrar of the Devil , at their head , To drown his Majesty on his return From Denmark ; how they sailed in sieves or riddles Unto North Berwick Kirk in Lothian , And , landing there , danced hand in hand , and sang , “ Goodwife , go ye before ! good wife , go ye ! If ye 'll not go before , goodwife , let me ! ” While Geilis Duncan played the Witches ’ Reel Upon a jews-harp .</p>
     <p>HATHORNE . Then you know full well The English law , and that in England Witches , When lawfully convicted and attainted , Are put to death .</p>
     <p>MATHER . When lawfully convicted ; That is the point .</p>
     <p>HATHORNE . You heard the evidence Produced before us yesterday at the trial Of Bridget Bishop .</p>
     <p>MATHER . One of the Afflicted , I know , bore witness to the apparition Of ghosts unto the spectre of this Bishop , Saying , “ You murdered us ! ” of the truth whereof There was in matter of fact too much Suspicion .</p>
     <p>HATHORNE . And when she cast her eyes on the Afflicted , They were struck down ; and this in such a manner There could be no collusion in the business . And when the accused but laid her hand upon them , As they lay in their swoons , they straight revived , Although they stirred not when the others touched them .</p>
     <p>MATHER . What most convinced me of the woman 's guilt Was finding hidden in her cellar wall Those poppets made of rags , with headless pins Stuck into them point outwards , and whereof She could not give a reasonable account .</p>
     <p>HATHORNE . When you shall read the testimony given Before the Court in all the other cases , I am persuaded you will find the proof No less conclusive than it was in this . Come , then , with me , and I will tax your patience With reading of the documents so far As may convince you that these sorcerers Are lawfully convicted and attainted . Like doubting Thomas , you shall lay your hand Upon these wounds , and you will doubt no more . { Exeunt .</p>

     <p>MARTHA . It came to pass that Naboth had a vineyard Hard by the palace of the King called Ahab . And Ahab , King of Israel , spake to Naboth , And said to him , Give unto me thy vineyard , That I may have it for a garden of herbs , And I will give a better vineyard for it , Or , if it seemeth good to thee , its worth In money . And then Naboth said to Ahab , The Lord forbid it me that I should give The inheritance of my fathers unto thee . And Ahab came into his house displeased And heavy at the words which Naboth spake , And laid him down upon his bed , and turned His face away ; and he would eat no bread . And Jezebel , the wife of Ahab , came And said to him , Why is thy spirit sad ? And he said unto her , Because I spake To Naboth , to the Jezreelite , and said , Give me thy vineyard ; and he answered , saying , I will not give my vineyard unto thee . And Jezebel , the wife of Ahab , said , Dost thou not rule the realm of Israel ? Arise , eat bread , and let thy heart be merry ; I will give Naboth 's vineyard unto thee . So she wrote letters in King Ahab 's name , And sealed them with his seal , and sent the letters Unto the elders that were in his city Dwelling with Naboth , and unto the nobles ; And in the letters wrote , Proclaim a fast ; And set this Naboth high among the people , And set two men , the sons of Belial , Before him , to bear witness and to say , Thou didst blaspheme against God and the King ; And carry him out and stone him , that he die ! And the elders and the nobles in the city Did even as Jezebel , the wife of Ahab , Had sent to them and written in the letters .</p>

     <p>GLOYD . I 've seen him lead the field , On a hot day , in mowing , and against Us younger men ; and I have wrestled with him . He threw me like a feather . I have seen him Lift up a barrel with his single hands , Which two strong men could hardly lift together , And , holding it above his head , drink from it .</p>
     <p>HATHORNE . That is enough ; we need not question further . What answer do you make to this , Giles Corey ?</p>

     <p>The crowd shrinks back from COREY in horror .</p>
     <p>HATHORNE . Ghosts of the dead and voices of the living Bear witness to your guilt , and you must die ! It might have been an easier death . Your doom Will be on your own head , and not on ours . Twice more will you be questioned of these things ; Twice more have room to plead or to confess . If you are contumacious to the Court , And if , when questioned , you refuse to answer , Then by the Statute you will be condemned To the peine forte et dure ! To have your body Pressed by great weights until you shall be dead ! And may the Lord have mercy on your soul !</p>

     <p>COREY . I 'm glad to see you , ay , right glad to see you .</p>
     <p>GARDNER . And I am most sorely grieved to see you thus .</p>
     <p>COREY . Of all the friends I had in happier days , You are the first , ay , and the only one , That comes to seek me out in my disgrace ! And you but come in time to say farewell , They 've dug my grave already in the field . I thank you . There is something in your presence , I know not what it is , that gives me strength . Perhaps it is the bearing of a man Familiar with all dangers of the deep , Familiar with the cries of drowning men , With fire , and wreck , and foundering ships at sea !</p>
     <p>GARDNER . Ah , I have never known a wreck like yours ! Would I could save you !</p>
     <p>COREY . Do not speak of that . It is too late . I am resolved to die .</p>
     <p>GARDNER . Why would you die who have so much to live for ?— Your daughters , and —</p>
     <p>COREY . You cannot say the word . My daughters have gone from me . They are married ; They have their homes , their thoughts , apart from me ; I will not say their hearts ,— that were too cruel . What would you have me do ?</p>
     <p>GARDNER . Confess and live . COREY . That 's what they said who came here yesterday To lay a heavy weight upon my conscience By telling me that I was driven forth As an unworthy member of their church .</p>
     <p>GARDNER . It is an awful death .</p>
     <p>COREY . ‘ T is but to drown , And have the weight of all the seas upon you .</p>
     <p>GARDNER . Say something ; say enough to fend off death Till this tornado of fanaticism Blows itself out . Let me come in between you And your severer self , with my plain sense ; Do not be obstinate .</p>
     <p>COREY . I will not plead . If I deny , I am condemned already , In courts where ghosts appear as witnesses , And swear men 's lives away . If I confess , Then I confess a lie , to buy a life Which is not life , but only death in life . I will not bear false witness against any , Not even against myself , whom I count least .</p>

     <p>COREY . I pray you , do not urge me to do that You would not do yourself . I have already The bitter taste of death upon my lips ; I feel the pressure of the heavy weight That will crush out my life within this hour ; But if a word could save me , and that word Were not the Truth ; nay , if it did but swerve A hair'shYpppHeNbreadth from the Truth , I would not say it !</p>

     <p>COREY . As for my wife , my Martha and my Martyr ,— Whose virtues , like the stars , unseen by day , Though numberless , do but await the dark To manifest themselves unto all eyes ,— She who first won me from my evil ways , And taught me how to live by her example , By her example teaches me to die , And leads me onward to the better life !</p>

     <p>SCENE III — A street in the Village . Enter GLOYD and others .</p>
     <p>GLOYD . Quick , or we shall be late !</p>
     <p>A MAN . That 's not the way . Come here ; come up this lane .</p>
     <p>GLOYD . I wonder now If the old man will die , and will not speak ? He 's obstinate enough and tough enough For anything on earth .</p>
     <p>A bell tolls .</p>
     <p>Hark ! What is that ?</p>
     <p>A MAN . The passing bell . He 's dead !</p>
     <p>GLOYD . We are too late . [ Exeunt in haste .</p>
     <p>SCENE IV . — A field near the graveyard , GILES COREY lying dead , with a great stone on his breast . The Sheriff at his head , RICHARD GARDNER at his feet . A crowd behind . The bell tolling . Enter HATHORNE and MATHER .</p>
     <p>HATHORNE . This is the Potter 's Field . Behold the fate Of those who deal in Witchcrafts , and , when questioned , Refuse to plead their guilt or innocence , And stubbornly drag death upon themselves .</p>
     <p>MATHER . O sight most horrible ! In a land like this , Spangled with Churches Evangelical , Inwrapped in our salvations , must we seek In mouldering statute-books of English Courts Some old forgotten Law , to do such deeds ? Those who lie buried in the Potter 's Field Will rise again , as surely as ourselves That sleep in honored graves with epitaphs ; And this poor man , whom we have made a victim , Hereafter will be counted as a martyr !</p>

     <p>SAINT JOHN . The Ages come and go , The Centuries pass as Years ; My hair is white as the snow , My feet are weary and slow , The earth is wet with my tears The kingdoms crumble , and fall Apart , like a ruined wall , Or a bank that is undermined By a river 's ceaseless flow , And leave no trace behind ! The world itself is old ; The portals of Time unfold On hinges of iron , that grate And groan with the rust and the weight , Like the hinges of a gate That hath fallen to decay ; But the evil doth not cease ; There is war instead of peace , Instead of Love there is hate ; And still I must wander and wait , Still I must watch and pray , Not forgetting in whose sight , A thousand years in their flight Are as a single day .</p>

      <head>SCENE I . — ANTIOCHUS ; JASON .</head>
      <head>ANTIOCHUS . O Antioch , my Antioch , my city ! Queen of the East ! my solace , my delight ! The dowry of my sister Cleopatra When she was wed to Ptolemy , and now Won back and made more wonderful by me ! I love thee , and I long to be once more Among the players and the dancing women Within thy gates , and bathe in the Orontes , Thy river and mine . O Jason , my High-Priest , For I have made thee so , and thou art mine , Hast thou seen Antioch the Beautiful ?</head>
       <l n="1">JASON .</l>
       <l n="2">Never , my Lord .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . Then hast thou never seen The wonder of the world . This city of David Compared with Antioch is but a village , And its inhabitants compared with Greeks Are mannerless boors .</p>
     <p>JASON . They are barbarians , And mannerless .</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . They must be civilized . They must be made to have more gods than one ; And goddesses besides .</p>
     <p>JASON . They shall have more .</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . They must have hippodromes , and games , and baths , Stage-plays and festivals , and most of all The Dionysia .</p>
     <p>JASON . They shall have them all .</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . By Heracles ! but I should like to see These Hebrews crowned with ivy , and arrayed In skins of fawns , with drums and flutes and thyrsi , Revel and riot through the solemn streets Of their old town . Ha , ha ! It makes me merry Only to think of it !— Thou dost not laugh .</p>
     <p>JASON . Yea , I laugh inwardly .</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . The new Greek leaven Works slowly in this Israelitish dough ! Have I not sacked the Temple , and on the altar Set up the statue of Olympian Zeus To Hellenize it ?</p>
     <p>JASON . Thou hast done all this .</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . As thou wast Joshua once and now art Jason , And from a Hebrew hast become a Greek , So shall this Hebrew nation be translated , Their very natures and their names be changed , And all be Hellenized .</p>
     <p>JASON . It shall be done .</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . Their manners and their laws and way of living Shall all be Greek . They shall unlearn their language , And learn the lovely speech of Antioch . Where hast thou been to-day ? Thou comest late .</p>
     <p>JASON . Playing at discus with the other priests In the Gymnasium .</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . Thou hast done well . There 's nothing better for you lazy priests Than discus-playing with the common people . Now tell me , Jason , what these Hebrews call me When they converse together at their games .</p>
     <p>JASON . Antiochus Epiphanes , my Lord ; Antiochus the Illustrious .</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . O , not that ; That is the public cry ; I mean the name They give me when they talk among themselves , And think that no one listens ; what is that ?</p>
     <p>JASON . Antiochus Epimanes , my Lord !</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . Antiochus the Mad ! Ay , that is it . And who hath said it ? Who hath set in motion That sorry jest ?</p>
     <p>JASON . The Seven Sons insane Of a weird woman , like themselves insane .</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . I like their courage , but it shall not save them . They shall be made to eat the flesh of swine , Or they shall die . Where are they ?</p>
     <p>JASON . In the dungeons Beneath this tower .</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . There let them stay and starve , Till I am ready to make Greeks of them , After my fashion .</p>
     <p>JASON . They shall stay and starve .— My Lord , the Ambassadors of Samaria Await thy pleasure .</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . Why not my displeasure ? Ambassadors are tedious . They are men Who work for their own ends , and not for mine There is no furtherance in them . Let them go To Apollonius , my governor There in Samaria , and not trouble me . What do they want ?</p>
     <p>JASON . Only the royal sanction To give a name unto a nameless temple Upon Mount Gerizim .</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . Then bid them enter . This pleases me , and furthers my designs . The occasion is auspicious . Bid them enter .</p>

When the Jews prosper , ye claim kindred with them ; When the Jews suffer , ye are Medes and Persians : I know that in the days of Alexander Ye claimed exemption from the annual tribute In the Sabbatic Year , because , ye said , Your fields had not been planted in that year .</p>

     <p>SCENE III . — ANTIOCHUS ; JASON .</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . My task is easier than I dreamed . These people Meet me half-way . Jason , didst thou take note How these Samaritans of Sichem said They were not Jews ? that they were Medes and Persians , They were Sidonians , anything but Jews ? ‘ T is of good augury . The rest will follow Till the whole land is Hellenized .</p>
     <p>JASON . My Lord , These are Samaritans . The tribe of Judah Is of a different temper , and the task Will be more difficult .</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . Dost thou gainsay me ?</p>
     <p>JASON . I know the stubborn nature of the Jew . Yesterday , Eleazer , an old man , Being fourscore years and ten , chose rather death By torture than to eat the flesh of swine .</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . The life is in the blood , and the whole nation Shall bleed to death , or it shall change its faith !</p>
     <p>JASON . Hundreds have fled already to the mountains Of Ephraim , where Judas Maccabaeus Hath raised the standard of revolt against thee .</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . I will burn down their city , and will make it Waste as a wilderness . Its thoroughfares Shall be but furrows in a field of ashes . It shall be sown with salt as Sodom is ! This hundred and fifty-third Olympiad Shall have a broad and blood-red sea upon it , Stamped with the awful letters of my name , Antiochus the God , Epiphanes !— Where are those Seven Sons ?</p>
     <p>JASON . My Lord , they wait Thy royal pleasure .</p>

Break not till they are dead , All , all my Seven Sons ; then burst asunder , And let this tortured and tormented soul Leap and rush out like water through the shards Of earthen vessels broken at a well . O my dear children , mine in life and death , I know not how ye came into my womb ; I neither gave you breath , nor gave you life , And neither was it I that formed the members Of every one of you . But the Creator , Who made the world , and made the heavens above us , Who formed the generation of mankind , And found out the beginning of all things , He gave you breath and life , and will again Of his own mercy , as ye now regard Not your own selves , but his eternal law . I do not murmur , nay , I thank thee , God , That I and mine have not been deemed unworthy To suffer for thy sake , and for thy law , And for the many sins of Israel . Hark ! I can hear within the sound of scourges ! I feel them more than ye do , O my sons ! But cannot come to you . I , who was wont To wake at night at the least cry ye made , To whom ye ran at every slightest hurt , I cannot take you now into my lap And soothe your pain , but God will take you all Into his pitying arms , and comfort you , And give you rest .</p>

And those bright golden locks , that I so oft Have curled about these fingers , even now Are foul with blood and dust , like a lamb 's fleece , Slain in the shambles .— Not a sound I hear . This silence is more terrible to me Than any sound , than any cry of pain , That might escape the lips of one who dies . Doth his heart fail him ? Doth he fall away In the last hour from God ? O Sirion , Sirion , Art thou afraid ? I do not hear thy voice . Die as thy brothers died . Thou must not live !</p>

     <p>THE MOTHER . God in heaven ! Can a man do such deeds , and yet not die By the recoil of his own wickedness ? Ye murdered , bleeding , mutilated bodies That were my children once , and still are mine , I cannot watch o'er you as Rispah watched In sackcloth o'er the seven sons of Saul , Till water drop upon you out of heaven And wash this blood away ! I cannot mourn As she , the daughter of Aiah , mourned the dead , From the beginning of the barley-harvest Until the autumn rains , and suffered not The birds of air to rest on them by day , Nor the wild beasts by night . For ye have died A better death , a death so full of life That I ought rather to rejoice than mourn .— Wherefore art thou not dead , O Sirion ? Wherefore art thou the only living thing Among thy brothers dead ? Art thou afraid ?</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . O woman , I have spared him for thy sake , For he is fair to look upon and comely ; And I have sworn to him by all the gods That I would crown his life with joy and honor , Heap treasures on him , luxuries , delights , Make him my friend and keeper of my secrets , If he would turn from your Mosaic Law And be as we are ; but he will not listen .</p>
     <p>THE MOTHER . My noble Sirion !</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . Therefore I beseech thee , Who art his mother , thou wouldst speak with him , And wouldst persuade him . I am sick of blood .</p>
     <p>THE MOTHER . Yea , I will speak with him and will persuade him . O Sirion , my son ! have pity on me , On me that bare thee , and that gave thee suck , And fed and nourished thee , and brought thee up With the dear trouble of a mother 's care Unto this age . Look on the heavens above thee , And on the earth and all that is therein ; Consider that God made them out of things That were not ; and that likewise in this manner Mankind was made . Then fear not this tormentor But , being worthy of thy brethren , take Thy death as they did , that I may receive thee Again in mercy with them .</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . I am mocked , Yea , I am laughed to scorn .</p>
     <p>SIRION . Whom wait ye for ? Never will I obey the King 's commandment , But the commandment of the ancient Law , That was by Moses given unto our fathers . And thou , O godless man , that of all others Art the most wicked , be not lifted up , Nor puffed up with uncertain hopes , uplifting Thy hand against the servants of the Lord , For thou hast not escaped the righteous judgment Of the Almighty God , who seeth all things !</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . He is no God of mine ; I fear him not .</p>
     <p>SIRION . My brothers , who have suffered a brief pain , Are dead ; but thou , Antiochus , shalt suffer The punishment of pride . I offer up My body and my life , beseeching God That he would speedily be merciful Unto our nation , and that thou by plagues Mysterious and by torments mayest confess That he alone is God .</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . Ye both shall perish By torments worse than any that your God , Here or hereafter , hath in store for me .</p>
     <p>THE MOTHER . My Sirion , I am proud of thee !</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . Be silent ! Go to thy bed of torture in yon chamber , Where lie so many sleepers , heartless mother ! Thy footsteps will not wake them , nor thy voice , Nor wilt thou hear , amid thy troubled dreams , Thy children crying for thee in the night !</p>
     <p>THE MOTHER . O Death , that stretchest thy white hands to me , I fear them not , but press them to my lips , That are as white as thine ; for I am Death , Nay , am the Mother of Death , seeing these sons All lying lifeless .— Kiss me , Sirion .</p>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>JUDAS . The trumpets sound ; the echoes of the mountains Answer them , as the Sabbath morning breaks Over Beth-horon and its battle-field , Where the great captain of the hosts of God , A slave brought up in the brick-fields of Egypt , O'ercame the Amorites . There was no day Like that , before or after it , nor shall be . The sun stood still ; the hammers of the hail Beat on their harness ; and the captains set Their weary feet upon the necks of kings , As I will upon thine , Antiochus , Thou man of blood !— Behold the rising sun Strikes on the golden letters of my banner , Be Elohim Yehovah ! Who is like To thee , O Lord , among the gods !— Alas ! I am not Joshua , I cannot say , “ Sun , stand thou still on Gibeon , and thou Moon , In Ajalon ! ” Nor am I one who wastes The fateful time in useless lamentation ; But one who bears his life upon his hand To lose it or to save it , as may best Serve the designs of Him who giveth life .</p>
     <p>SCENE II — JUDAS MACCABAEUS ; JEWISH FUGITIVES .</p>
     <p>JUDAS . Who and what are ye , that with furtive steps Steal in among our tents ?</p>
     <p>FUGITIVES . O Maccabaeus , Outcasts are we , and fugitives as thou art , Jews of Jerusalem , that have escaped From the polluted city , and from death .</p>
     <p>JUDAS . None can escape from death . Say that ye come To die for Israel , and ye are welcome . What tidings bring ye ?</p>
     <p>FUGITIVES . Tidings of despair . The Temple is laid waste ; the precious vessels , Censers of gold , vials and veils and crowns , And golden ornaments , and hidden treasures , Have all been taken from it , and the Gentiles With revelling and with riot fill its courts , And dally with harlots in the holy places .</p>
     <p>JUDAS . All this I knew before .</p>
     <p>FUGITIVES . Upon the altar Are things profane , things by the law forbidden ; Nor can we keep our Sabbaths or our Feasts , But on the festivals of Dionysus Must walk in their processions , bearing ivy To crown a drunken god .</p>
     <p>JUDAS . This too I know . But tell me of the Jews . How fare the Jews ?</p>
     <p>FUGITIVES . The coming of this mischief hath been sore And grievous to the people . All the land Is full of lamentation and of mourning . The Princes and the Elders weep and wail ; The young men and the maidens are made feeble ; The beauty of the women hath been changed .</p>
     <p>JUDAS . And are there none to die for Israel ? ‘ T is not enough to mourn . Breastplate and harness Are better things than sackcloth . Let the women Lament for Israel ; the men should die .</p>
     <p>FUGITIVES . Both men and women die ; old men and young : Old Eleazer died : and Mahala With all her Seven Sons .</p>
     <p>JUDAS . Antiochus , At every step thou takest there is left A bloody footprint in the street , by which The avenging wrath of God will track thee out ! It is enough . Go to the sutler 's tents ; Those of you who are men , put on such armor As ye may find ; those of you who are women , Buckle that armor on ; and for a watchword Whisper , or cry aloud , “ The Help of God . ”</p>

      <head>SCENE III . — JUDAS MACCABAEUS ; NICANOR .</head>
       <l n="1">NICANOR .</l>
       <l n="2">Hail , Judas Maccabaeus !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>JUDAS . Hail !— Who art thou That comest here in this mysterious guise Into our camp unheralded ?</p>
     <p>NICANOR . A herald Sent from Nicanor .</p>
     <p>JUDAS . Heralds come not thus . Armed with thy shirt of mail from head to heel , Thou glidest like a serpent silently Into my presence . Wherefore dost thou turn Thy face from me ? A herald speaks his errand With forehead unabashed . Thou art a spy sent by Nicanor .</p>
     <p>NICANOR . No disguise avails ! Behold my face ; I am Nicanor 's self .</p>
     <p>JUDAS . Thou art indeed Nicanor . I salute thee . What brings thee hither to this hostile camp Thus unattended ?</p>
     <p>NICANOR . Confidence in thee . Thou hast the nobler virtues of thy race , Without the failings that attend those virtues . Thou canst be strong , and yet not tyrannous , Canst righteous be and not intolerant . Let there be peace between us .</p>
     <p>JUDAS . What is peace ? Is it to bow in silence to our victors ? Is it to see our cities sacked and pillaged , Our people slain , or sold as slaves , or fleeing At night-time by the blaze of burning towns ; Jerusalem laid waste ; the Holy Temple Polluted with strange gods ? Are these things peace ?</p>
     <p>NICANOR . These are the dire necessities that wait On war , whose loud and bloody enginery I seek to stay . Let there be peace between Antiochus and thee .</p>
     <p>JUDAS . Antiochus ? What is Antiochus , that he should prate Of peace to me , who am a fugitive ? To-day he shall be lifted up ; to-morrow Shall not be found , because he is returned Unto his dust ; his thought has come to nothing . There is no peace between us , nor can be , Until this banner floats upon the walls Of our Jerusalem .</p>
     <p>NICANOR . Between that city And thee there lies a waving wall of tents , Held by a host of forty thousand foot , And horsemen seven thousand . What hast thou To bring against all these ?</p>
     <p>JUDAS . The power of God , Whose breath shall scatter your white tents abroad , As flakes of snow .</p>
     <p>NICANOR . Your Mighty One in heaven Will not do battle on the Seventh Day ; It is his day of rest .</p>
     <p>JUDAS . Silence , blasphemer . Go to thy tents .</p>
     <p>NICANOR . Shall it be war or peace ?</p>
     <p>JUDAS . War , war , and only war . Go to thy tents That shall be scattered , as by you were scattered The torn and trampled pages of the Law , Blown through the windy streets .</p>
     <p>NICANOR . Farewell , brave foe !</p>
     <p>JUDAS . Ho , there , my captains ! Have safe-conduct given Unto Nicanor 's herald through the camp , And come yourselves to me .— Farewell , Nicanor !</p>
     <p>SCENE IV . — JUDAS MACCABAEUS ; CAPTAINS AND SOLDIERS .</p>
     <p>JUDAS . The hour is come . Gather the host together For battle . Lo , with trumpets and with songs The army of Nicanor comes against us . Go forth to meet them , praying in your hearts , And fighting with your hands .</p>
     <p>CAPTAINS . Look forth and see ! The morning sun is shining on their shields Of gold and brass ; the mountains glisten with them , And shine like lamps . And we who are so few And poorly armed , and ready to faint with fasting , How shall we fight against this multitude ?</p>
     <p>JUDAS . The victory of a battle standeth not In multitudes , but in the strength that cometh From heaven above . The Lord forbid that I Should do this thing , and flee away from them . Nay , if our hour be come , then let us die ; Let us not stain our honor .</p>
     <p>CAPTAINS . ‘ T is the Sabbath . Wilt thou fight on the Sabbath , Maccabaeus ?</p>
     <p>JUDAS . Ay ; when I fight the battles of the Lord , I fight them on his day , as on all others . Have ye forgotten certain fugitives That fled once to these hills , and hid themselves In caves ? How their pursuers camped against them Upon the Seventh Day , and challenged them ? And how they answered not , nor cast a stone , Nor stopped the places where they lay concealed , But meekly perished with their wives and children , Even to the number of a thousand souls ? We who are fighting for our laws and lives Will not so perish .</p>
     <p>CAPTAINS . Lead us to the battle !</p>
     <p>JUDAS . And let our watchword be , “ The Help of God ! ” Last night I dreamed a dream ; and in my vision Beheld Onias , our High-Priest of old , Who holding up his hands prayed for the Jews . This done , in the like manner there appeared An old man , and exceeding glorious , With hoary hair , and of a wonderful And excellent majesty . And Onias said : “ This is a lover of the Jews , who prayeth Much for the people and the Holy City ,— God 's prophet Jeremias . ” And the prophet Held forth his right hand and gave unto me A sword of gold ; and giving it he said : “ Take thou this holy sword , a gift from God , And with it thou shalt wound thine adversaries . ”</p>
     <p>CAPTAINS . The Lord is with us !</p>
     <p>JUDAS . Hark ! I hear the trumpets Sound from Beth-horon ; from the battle-field Of Joshua , where he smote the Amorites , Smote the Five Kings of Eglon and of Jarmuth , Of Hebron , Lachish , and Jerusalem , As we to-day will smite Nicanor 's hosts And leave a memory of great deeds behind us .</p>

     <p>JUDAS . Be Elohim Yehovah ! Lord , thou didst send thine Angel in the time Of Esekias , King of Israel , And in the armies of Sennacherib Didst slay a hundred fourscore and five thousand . Wherefore , O Lord of heaven , now also send Before us a good angel for a fear , And through the might of thy right arm let those Be stricken with terror that have come this day Against thy holy people to blaspheme !</p>

       <l n="1">The outer Courts of the Temple at Jerusalem .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>SCENE I . — JUDAS MACCABAEUS ; CAPTAINS ; JEWS .</p>
     <p>JUDAS . Behold , our enemies are discomfited . Jerusalem is fallen ; and our banners Float from her battlements , and o'er her gates Nicanor 's severed head , a sign of terror , Blackens in wind and sun .</p>
     <p>CAPTAINS . O Maccabaeus , The citadel of Antiochus , wherein The Mother with her Seven Sons was murdered , Is still defiant .</p>
     <p>JUDAS . Wait .</p>
     <p>CAPTAINS . Its hateful aspect Insults us with the bitter memories Of other days .</p>
     <p>JUDAS . Wait ; it shall disappear And vanish as a cloud . First let us cleanse The Sanctuary . See , it is become Waste like a wilderness . Its golden gates Wrenched from their hinges and consumed by fire ; Shrubs growing in its courts as in a forest ; Upon its altars hideous and strange idols ; And strewn about its pavement at my feet Its Sacred Books , half burned and painted o'er With images of heathen gods .</p>
     <p>JEWS . Woe ! woe ! Our beauty and our glory are laid waste ! The Gentiles have profaned our holy places !</p>
     <p>( Lamentation and alarm of trumpets . )</p>
     <p>JUDAS . This sound of trumpets , and this lamentation , The heart-cry of a people toward the heavens , Stir me to wrath and vengeance . Go , my captains ; I hold you back no longer . Batter down The citadel of Antiochus , while here We sweep away his altars and his gods .</p>
     <p>SCENE II . — JUDAS MACCABAEUS ; JASON ; JEWS ,</p>
     <p>JEWS . Lurking among the ruins of the Temple , Deep in its inner courts , we found this man , Clad as High-Priest .</p>
     <p>JUDAS . I ask not who thou art . I know thy face , writ over with deceit As are these tattered volumes of the Law With heathen images . A priest of God Wast thou in other days , but thou art now A priest of Satan . Traitor , thou art Jason .</p>
     <p>JASON . I am thy prisoner , Judas Maccabaeus , And it would ill become me to conceal My name or office .</p>
     <p>JUDAS . Over yonder gate There hangs the head of one who was a Greek . What should prevent me now , thou man of sin , From hanging at its side the head of one Who born a Jew hath made himself a Greek ?</p>
     <p>JASON . Justice prevents thee .</p>
     <p>JUDAS . Justice ? Thou art stained With every crime against which the Decalogue Thunders with all its thunder .</p>
     <p>JASON . If not Justice , Then Mercy , her handmaiden .</p>
     <p>JUDAS . When hast thou At any time , to any man or woman , Or even to any little child , shown mercy ?</p>
     <p>JASON . I have but done what King Antiochus Commanded me .</p>
     <p>JUDAS . True , thou hast been the weapon With which he struck ; but hast been such a weapon , So flexible , so fitted to his hand , It tempted him to strike . So thou hast urged him To double wickedness , thine own and his . Where is this King ? Is he in Antioch Among his women still , and from his windows Throwing down gold by handfuls , for the rabble To scramble for ?</p>
     <p>JASON . Nay , he is gone from there , Gone with an army into the far East .</p>
     <p>JUDAS . And wherefore gone ?</p>
     <p>JASON . I know not . For the space Of forty days almost were horsemen seen Running in air , in cloth of gold , and armed With lances , like a band of soldiery ; It was a sign of triumph .</p>
     <p>JUDAS . Or of death . Wherefore art thou not with him ?</p>
     <p>JASON . I was left For service in the Temple .</p>
     <p>JUDAS . To pollute it , And to corrupt the Jews ; for there are men Whose presence is corruption ; to be with them Degrades us and deforms the things we do .</p>
     <p>JASON . I never made a boast , as some men do , Of my superior virtue , nor denied The weakness of my nature , that hath made me Subservient to the will of other men .</p>
     <p>JUDAS . Upon this day , the five and twentieth day Of the month Caslan , was the Temple here Profaned by strangers ,— by Antiochus And thee , his instrument . Upon this day Shall it be cleansed . Thou , who didst lend thyself Unto this profanation , canst not be A witness of these solemn services . There can be nothing clean where thou art present . The people put to death Callisthenes , Who burned the Temple gates ; and if they find thee Will surely slay thee . I will spare thy life To punish thee the longer . Thou shalt wander Among strange nations . Thou , that hast cast out So many from their native land , shalt perish In a strange land . Thou , that hast left so many Unburied , shalt have none to mourn for thee , Nor any solemn funerals at all , Nor sepulchre with thy fathers .— Get thee hence !</p>
     <p>( Music . Procession of Priests and people , with citherns , harps , and cymbals . JUDAS MACCABAEUS puts himself at their head , and they go into the inner courts . )</p>
     <p>SCENE III . — JASON , alone .</p>
     <p>JASON . Through the Gate Beautiful I see them come With branches and green boughs and leaves of palm , And pass into the inner courts . Alas ! I should be with them , should be one of them , But in an evil hour , an hour of weakness , That cometh unto all , I fell away From the old faith , and did not clutch the new , Only an outward semblance of belief ; For the new faith I cannot make mine own , Not being born to it . It hath no root Within me . I am neither Jew nor Greek , But stand between them both , a renegade To each in turn ; having no longer faith In gods or men . Then what mysterious charm , What fascination is it chains my feet , And keeps me gazing like a curious child Into the holy places , where the priests Have raised their altar ?— Striking stones together , They take fire out of them , and light the lamps In the great candlestick . They spread the veils , And set the loaves of showbread on the table . The incense burns ; the well-remembered odor Comes wafted unto me , and takes me back To other days . I see myself among them As I was then ; and the old superstition Creeps over me again !— A childish fancy !— And hark ! they sing with citherns and with cymbals , And all the people fall upon their faces , Praying and worshipping !— I will away Into the East , to meet Antiochus Upon his homeward journey , crowned with triumph . Alas ! to-day I would give everything To see a friend 's face , or to hear a voice That had the slightest tone of comfort in it !</p>

      <head>ANTIOCHUS . Here let us rest awhile . Where are we , Philip ? What place is this ?</head>
      <head>PHILIP . Ecbatana , my Lord ; And yonder mountain range is the Orontes .</head>
      <head>ANTIOCHUS . The Orontes is my river at Antioch . Why did I leave it ? Why have I been tempted By coverings of gold and shields and breastplates To plunder Elymais , and be driven From out its gates , as by a fiery blast Out of a furnace ?</head>

       <l n="2">These are fortune 's changes .</l>

     <p>ANTIOCHUS . What a defeat it was ! The Persian horsemen Came like a mighty wind , the wind Khamaseen , And melted us away , and scattered us As if we were dead leaves , or desert sand .</p>
     <p>PHILIP . Be comforted , my Lord ; for thou hast lost But what thou hadst not .</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . I , who made the Jews Skip like the grasshoppers , am made myself To skip among these stones .</p>
     <p>PHILIP . Be not discouraged . Thy realm of Syria remains to thee ; That is not lost nor marred .</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . O , where are now The splendors of my court , my baths and banquets ? Where are my players and my dancing women ? Where are my sweet musicians with their pipes , That made me merry in the olden time ? I am a laughing-stock to man and brute . The very camels , with their ugly faces , Mock me and laugh at me .</p>
     <p>PHILIP . Alas ! my Lord , It is not so . If thou wouldst sleep awhile , All would be well .</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . Sleep from mine eyes is gone , And my heart faileth me for very care . Dost thou remember , Philip , the old fable Told us when we were boys , in which the bear Going for honey overturns the hive , And is stung blind by bees ? I am that beast , Stung by the Persian swarms of Elymais .</p>
     <p>PHILIP . When thou art come again to Antioch These thoughts will be as covered and forgotten As are the tracks of Pharaoh 's chariot-wheels In the Egyptian sands .</p>

     <p>ANTIOCHUS . A strange foreboding Of something evil overshadows me . I am no reader of the Jewish Scriptures ; I know not Hebrew ; but my High-Priest Jason , As I remember , told me of a Prophet Who saw a little cloud rise from the sea Like a man 's hand and soon the heaven was black With clouds and rain . Here , Philip , read ; I cannot ; I see that cloud . It makes the letters dim Before mine eyes .</p>

My captains , My Lysias , Gorgias , Seron , and Nicanor , Are babes in battle , and this dreadful Jew Will rob me of my kingdom and my crown .

     <p>( Throws up his hands , and sinks into the arms of attendants , who lay him upon a bank . )</p>
     <p>PHILIP . Antiochus ! Antiochus ! Alas , The King is ill ! What is it , O my Lord ?</p>
     <p>ANTIOCHUS . Nothing . A sudden and sharp spasm of pain , As if the lightning struck me , or the knife Of an assassin smote me to the heart . ‘ T is passed , even as it came . Let us set forward .</p>

     <p>ANTIOCHUS . How canst thou help it , Philip ? O the pain ! Stab after stab . Thou hast no shield against This unseen weapon . God of Israel , Since all the other gods abandon me , Help me . I will release the Holy City . Garnish with goodly gifts the Holy Temple . Thy people , whom I judged to be unworthy To be so much as buried , shall be equal Unto the citizens of Antioch . I will become a Jew , and will declare Through all the world that is inhabited The power of God !</p>

      <head>PROLOGUE AT ISCHIA</head>
       <l n="1">The Castle Terrace . VITTORIA COLONNA , and JULIA GONZAGA .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>VITTORIA . Will you then leave me , Julia , and so soon , To pace alone this terrace like a ghost ?</p>
     <p>JULIA . To-morrow , dearest .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . Do not say to-morrow . A whole month of to-morrows were too soon . You must not go . You are a part of me .</p>
     <p>JULIA . I must return to Fondi .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . The old castle Needs not your presence . No one waits for you . Stay one day longer with me . They who go Feel not the pain of parting ; it is they Who stay behind that suffer . I was thinking But yesterday how like and how unlike Have been , and are , our destinies . Your husband , The good Vespasian , an old man , who seemed A father to you rather than a husband , Died in your arms ; but mine , in all the flower And promise of his youth , was taken from me As by a rushing wind . The breath of battle Breathed on him , and I saw his face no more , Save as in dreams it haunts me . As our love Was for these men , so is our sorrow for them . Yours a child 's sorrow , smiling through its tears ; But mine the grief of an impassioned woman , Who drank her life up in one draught of love .</p>
     <p>JULIA . Behold this locket . This is the white hair Of my Vespasian . This is the flower-of-love , This amaranth , and beneath it the device Non moritura . Thus my heart remains True to his memory ; and the ancient castle , Where we have lived together , where he died , Is dear to me as Ischia is to you .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . I did not mean to chide you .</p>
     <p>JULIA . Let your heart Find , if it can , some poor apology For one who is too young , and feels too keenly The joy of life , to give up all her days To sorrow for the dead . While I am true To the remembrance of the man I loved And mourn for still , I do not make a show Of all the grief I feel , nor live secluded And , like Veronica da Gambara , Drape my whole house in mourning , and drive forth In coach of sable drawn by sable horses , As if I were a corpse . Ah , one to-day Is worth for me a thousand yesterdays .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . Dear Julia ! Friendship has its jealousies As well as love . Who waits for you at Fondi ?</p>
     <p>JULIA . A friend of mine and yours ; a friend and friar . You have at Naples your Fra Bernadino ; And I at Fondi have my Fra Bastiano , The famous artist , who has come from Rome To paint my portrait . That is not a sin .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . Only a vanity .</p>
     <p>JULIA . He painted yours .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . Do not call up to me those days departed When I was young , and all was bright about me , And the vicissitudes of life were things But to be read of in old histories , Though as pertaining unto me or mine Impossible . Ah , then I dreamed your dreams , And now , grown older , I look back and see They were illusions .</p>
     <p>JULIA . Yet without illusions What would our lives become , what we ourselves ? Dreams or illusions , call them what you will , They lift us from the commonplace of life To better things .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . Are there no brighter dreams , No higher aspirations , than the wish To please and to be pleased ?</p>
     <p>JULIA . For you there are ; I am no saint ; I feel the world we live in Comes before that which is to be here after , And must be dealt with first .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . But in what way ?</p>
     <p>JULIA . Let the soft wind that wafts to us the odor Of orange blossoms , let the laughing sea And the bright sunshine bathing all the world , Answer the question .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . And for whom is meant This portrait that you speak of ?</p>
     <p>JULIA . For my friend The Cardinal Ippolito .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . For him ?</p>
     <p>JULIA Yes , for Ippolito the Magnificent . ‘ T is always flattering to a woman 's pride To be admired by one whom all admire .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . Ah , Julia , she that makes herself a dove Is eaten by the hawk . Be on your guard , He is a Cardinal ; and his adoration Should be elsewhere directed .</p>
     <p>JULIA . You forget The horror of that night , when Barbarossa , The Moorish corsair , landed on our coast To seize me for the Sultan Soliman ; How in the dead of night , when all were sleeping , He scaled the castle wall ; how I escaped , And in my night-dress , mounting a swift steed , Fled to the mountains , and took refuge there Among the brigands . Then of all my friends The Cardinal Ippolito was first To come with his retainers to my rescue . Could I refuse the only boon he asked At such a time , my portrait ?</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . I have heard Strange stories of the splendors of his palace , And how , apparelled like a Spanish Prince , He rides through Rome with a long retinue Of Ethiopians and Numidians And Turks and Tartars , in fantastic dresses , Making a gallant show . Is this the way A Cardinal should live ?</p>
     <p>JULIA . He is so young ; Hardly of age , or little more than that ; Beautiful , generous , fond of arts and letters , A poet , a musician , and a scholar ; Master of many languages , and a player On many instruments . In Rome , his palace Is the asylum of all men distinguished In art or science , and all Florentines Escaping from the tyranny of his cousin , Duke Alessandro .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . I have seen his portrait , Painted by Titian . You have painted it In brighter colors .</p>
     <p>JULIA . And my Cardinal , At Itri , in the courtyard of his palace , Keeps a tame lion !</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . And so counterfeits St. Mark , the Evangelist !</p>
     <p>JULIA . Ah , your tame lion Is Michael Angelo .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . You speak a name That always thrills me with a noble sound , As of a trumpet ! Michael Angelo ! A lion all men fear and none can tame ; A man that all men honor , and the model That all should follow ; one who works and prays , For work is prayer , and consecrates his life To the sublime ideal of his art , Till art and life are one ; a man who holds Such place in all men 's thoughts , that when they speak Of great things done , or to be done , his name Is ever on their lips .</p>
     <p>JULIA . You too can paint The portrait of your hero , and in colors Brighter than Titian 's ; I might warn you also Against the dangers that beset your path ; But I forbear .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . If I were made of marble , Of Fior di Persico or Pavonazzo , He might admire me : being but flesh and blood , I am no more to him than other women ; That is , am nothing .</p>
     <p>JULIA . Does he ride through Rome Upon his little mule , as he was wont , With his slouched hat , and boots of Cordovan , As when I saw him last ?</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . Pray do not jest . I cannot couple with his noble name A trivial word ! Look , how the setting sun Lights up Castel-a-mare and Sorrento , And changes Capri to a purple cloud ! And there Vesuvius with its plume of smoke , And the great city stretched upon the shore As in a dream !</p>
     <p>JULIA . Parthenope the Siren !</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . And yon long line of lights , those sunlit windows Blaze like the torches carried in procession To do her honor ! It is beautiful !</p>
     <p>JULIA . I have no heart to feel the beauty of it ! My feet are weary , pacing up and down These level flags , and wearier still my thoughts Treading the broken pavement of the Past , It is too sad . I will go in and rest , And make me ready for to-morrow 's journey .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . I will go with you ; for I would not lose One hour of your dear presence . ‘ T is enough Only to be in the same room with you . I need not speak to you , nor hear you speak ; If I but see you , I am satisfied . [ They go in .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Why did the Pope and his ten Cardinals Come here to lay this heavy task upon me ? Were not the paintings on the Sistine ceiling Enough for them ? They saw the Hebrew leader Waiting , and clutching his tempestuous beard , But heeded not . The bones of Julius Shook in their sepulchre . I heard the sound ; They only heard the sound of their own voices .</p>

       <l n="1">Are there no other artists here in Rome</l>

       <l n="3">Fra Bastian , my Era Bastian , might have done it ;</l>
       <l n="4">But he is lost to art . The Papal Seals ,</l>

       <l n="28">When all the wisdom of the world appears</l>
       <l n="29">As trivial as the gossip of a nurse</l>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . I met your messenger upon the way , And hastened hither .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . It is kind of you To come to us , who linger here like gossips Wasting the afternoon in idle talk . These are all friends of mine and friends of yours .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . If friends of yours , then are they friends of mine . Pardon me , gentlemen . But when I entered I saw but the Marchesa .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . Take this seat Between me and Ser Claudio Tolommei , Who still maintains that our Italian tongue Should be called Tuscan . But for that offence We will not quarrel with him .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Eccellenza —</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . Ser Claudio has banished Eccellenza And all such titles from the Tuscan tongue .</p>
     <p>MESSER CLAUDIO . ‘ T is the abuse of them and not the use I deprecate .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . The use or the abuse It matters not . Let them all go together , As empty phrases and frivolities , And common as gold-lace upon the collar Of an obsequious lackey .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . That may be , But something of politeness would go with them ; We should lose something of the stately manners Of the old school .</p>
     <p>MESSER CLAUDIO . Undoubtedly .</p>

       <l n="5">It was to counsel me . His Holiness</l>
       <l n="6">Has granted me permission , long desired ,</l>
       <l n="7">To build a convent in this neighborhood ,</l>
       <l n="8">Where the old tower is standing , from whose top</l>
       <l n="9">Nero looked down upon the burning city .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="10">MICHAEL ANGELO .</l>
       <l n="11">It is an inspiration !</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>VITTORIA . I am doubtful How I shall build ; how large to make the convent , And which way fronting .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Ah , to build , to build ! That is the noblest art of all the arts . Painting and sculpture are but images , Are merely shadows cast by outward things On stone or canvas , having in themselves No separate existence . Architecture , Existing in itself , and not in seeming A something it is not , surpasses them As substance shadow . Long , long years ago , Standing one morning near the Baths of Titus , I saw the statue of Laocoon Rise from its grave of centuries , like a ghost Writhing in pain ; and as it tore away The knotted serpents from its limbs , I heard , Or seemed to hear , the cry of agony From its white , parted lips . And still I marvel At the three Rhodian artists , by whose hands This miracle was wrought . Yet he beholds Far nobler works who looks upon the ruins Of temples in the Forum here in Rome . If God should give me power in my old age To build for Him a temple half as grand As those were in their glory , I should count My age more excellent than youth itself , And all that I have hitherto accomplished As only vanity .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . I understand you . Art is the gift of God , and must be used Unto His glory . That in art is highest Which aims at this . When St. Hilarion blessed The horses of Italicus , they won The race at Gaza , for his benediction O'erpowered all magic ; and the people shouted That Christ had conquered Marnas . So that art Which bears the consecration and the seal Of holiness upon it will prevail Over all others . Those few words of yours Inspire me with new confidence to build . What think you ? The old walls might serve , perhaps , Some purpose still . The tower can hold the bells .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . If strong enough .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . If not , it can be strengthened .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . I see no bar nor drawback to this building , And on our homeward way , if it shall please you , We may together view the site .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . I thank you . I did not venture to request so much .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Let us now go to the old walls you spake of , Vossignoria —</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . What , again , Maestro ?</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Pardon me , Messer Claudio , if once more I use the ancient courtesies of speech . I am too old to change .</p>

       <l n="3">JACOPO NARDI , an old man , alone .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>NARDI . I am bewildered . These Numidian slaves , In strange attire ; these endless ante-chambers ; This lighted hall , with all its golden splendors , Pictures , and statues ! Can this be the dwelling Of a disciple of that lowly Man Who had not where to lay his head ? These statues Are not of Saints ; nor is this a Madonna , This lovely face , that with such tender eyes Looks down upon me from the painted canvas . My heart begins to fail me . What can he Who lives in boundless luxury at Rome Care for the imperilled liberties of Florence , Her people , her Republic ? Ah , the rich Feel not the pangs of banishment . All doors Are open to them , and all hands extended , The poor alone are outcasts ; they who risked All they possessed for liberty , and lost ; And wander through the world without a friend , Sick , comfortless , distressed , unknown , uncared for .</p>
     <p>Enter CARDINAL HIPPOLITO , in Spanish cloak and slouched hat .</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . I pray you pardon me that I have kept you Waiting so long alone .</p>
     <p>NARDI . I wait to see The Cardinal .</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . I am the Cardinal . And you ?</p>
     <p>NARDI . Jacopo Nardi .</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . You are welcome I was expecting you . Philippo Strozzi Had told me of your coming .</p>
     <p>NARDI . ‘ T was his son That brought me to your door .</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . Pray you , be seated . You seem astonished at the garb I wear , But at my time of life , and with my habits , The petticoats of a Cardinal would be — Troublesome ; I could neither ride nor walk , Nor do a thousand things , if I were dressed Like an old dowager . It were putting wine Young as the young Astyanax into goblets As old as Priam .</p>
     <p>NARDI . Oh , your Eminence Knows best what you should wear .</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . Dear Messer Nardi , You are no stranger to me . I have read Your excellent translation of the books Of Titus Livius , the historian Of Rome , and model of all historians That shall come after him . It does you honor ; But greater honor still the love you bear To Florence , our dear country , and whose annals I hope your hand will write , in happier days Than we now see .</p>
     <p>NARDI . Your Eminence will pardon The lateness of the hour .</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . The hours I count not As a sun-dial ; but am like a clock , That tells the time as well by night as day . So no excuse . I know what brings you here . You come to speak of Florence .</p>
     <p>NARDI . And her woes .</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . The Duke , my cousin , the black Alessandro , Whose mother was a Moorish slave , that fed The sheep upon Lorenzo 's farm , still lives And reigns .</p>
     <p>NARDI . Alas , that such a scourge Should fall on such a city !</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . When he dies , The Wild Boar in the gardens of Lorenzo , The beast obscene , should be the monument Of this bad man .</p>
     <p>NARDI . He walks the streets at night With revellers , insulting honest men . No house is sacred from his lusts . The convents Are turned by him to brothels , and the honor Of women and all ancient pious customs Are quite forgotten now . The offices Of the Priori and Gonfalonieri Have been abolished . All the magistrates Are now his creatures . Liberty is dead . The very memory of all honest living Is wiped away , and even our Tuscan tongue Corrupted to a Lombard dialect .</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . And worst of all his impious hand has broken The Martinella ,— our great battle bell , That , sounding through three centuries , has led The Florentines to victory ,— lest its voice Should waken in their souls some memory Of far-off times of glory .</p>
     <p>NARDI . What a change Ten little years have made ! We all remember Those better days , when Niccola Capponi , The Gonfaloniere , from the windows Of the Old Palace , with the blast of trumpets , Proclaimed to the inhabitants that Christ Was chosen King of Florence ; and already Christ is dethroned , and slain , and in his stead Reigns Lucifer ! Alas , alas , for Florence !</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . Lilies with lilies , said Savonarola ; Florence and France ! But I say Florence only , Or only with the Emperor 's hand to help us In sweeping out the rubbish .</p>
     <p>NARDI . Little hope Of help is there from him . He has betrothed His daughter Margaret to this shameless Duke . What hope have we from such an Emperor ?</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . Baccio Valori and Philippo Strozzi , Once the Duke 's friends and intimates are with us , And Cardinals Salvati and Ridolfi . We shall soon see , then , as Valori says , Whether the Duke can best spare honest men , Or honest men the Duke .</p>
     <p>NARDI . We have determined To send ambassadors to Spain , and lay Our griefs before the Emperor , though I fear More than I hope .</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . The Emperor is busy With this new war against the Algerines , And has no time to listen to complaints From our ambassadors ; nor will I trust them , But go myself . All is in readiness For my departure , and to-morrow morning I shall go down to Itri , where I meet Dante da Castiglione and some others , Republicans and fugitives from Florence , And then take ship at Gaeta , and go To join the Emperor in his new crusade Against the Turk . I shall have time enough And opportunity to plead our cause .</p>

       <l n="12">Enter FRA SEBASTIANO ; Turkish attendants .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>IPPOLITO . Fra Bastiano , how your portly presence Contrasts with that of the spare Florentine Who has just left me !</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . As we passed each other , I saw that he was weeping .</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . Poor old man !</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . Who is he ?</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . Jacopo Nardi . A brave soul ; One of the Fuoruseiti , and the best And noblest of them all ; but he has made me Sad with his sadness . As I look on you My heart grows lighter . I behold a man Who lives in an ideal world , apart From all the rude collisions of our life , In a calm atmosphere .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . Your Eminence Is surely jesting . If you knew the life Of artists as I know it , you might think Far otherwise .</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . But wherefore should I jest ? The world of art is an ideal world ,— The world I love , and that I fain would live in ; So speak to me of artists and of art , Of all the painters , sculptors , and musicians That now illustrate Rome .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . Of the musicians , I know but Goudimel , the brave maestro And chapel-master of his Holiness , Who trains the Papal choir .</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . In church this morning , I listened to a mass of Goudimel , Divinely chanted . In the Incarnatus , In lieu of Latin words , the tenor sang With infinite tenderness , in plain Italian , A Neapolitan love-song .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . You amaze me . Was it a wanton song ?</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . Not a divine one . I am not over-scrupulous , as you know , In word or deed , yet such a song as that . Sung by the tenor of the Papal choir , And in a Papal mass , seemed out of place ; There 's something wrong in it .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . There 's something wrong In everything . We cannot make the world Go right . ‘ T is not my business to reform The Papal choir .</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . Nor mine , thank Heaven . Then tell me of the artists .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . Naming one I name them all ; for there is only one . His name is Messer Michael Angelo . All art and artists of the present day Centre in him .</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . You count yourself as nothing !</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . Or less than nothing , since I am at best Only a portrait-painter ; one who draws With greater or less skill , as best he may , The features of a face .</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . And you have had The honor , nay , the glory , of portraying Julia Gonzaga ! Do you count as nothing A privilege like that ? See there the portrait Rebuking you with its divine expression . Are you not penitent ? He whose skilful hand Painted that lovely picture has not right To vilipend the art of portrait-painting . But what of Michael Angelo ?</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . But lately Strolling together down the crowded Corso , We stopped , well pleased , to see your Eminence Pass on an Arab steed , a noble creature , Which Michael Angelo , who is a lover Of all things beautiful , especially When they are Arab horses , much admired , And could not praise enough .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">IPPOLITO , to an attendant .</l>
       <l n="2">Hassan , to-morrow ,</l>
       <l n="3">When I am gone , but not till I am gone ,—</l>
       <l n="4">Be careful about that ,— take Barbarossa</l>
       <l n="5">To Messer Michael Angelo , the sculptor ,</l>
       <l n="6">Who lives there at Macello dei Corvi ,</l>
       <l n="7">Near to the Capitol ; and take besides</l>
       <l n="8">Some ten mule-loads of provender , and say</l>
       <l n="9">Your master sends them to him as a present .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . A princely gift . Though Michael Angelo Refuses presents from his Holiness , Yours he will not refuse .</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . You think him like Thymoetes , who received the wooden horse Into the walls of Troy . That book of Virgil Have I translated in Italian verse , And shall , some day , when we have leisure for it , Be pleased to read you . When I speak of Troy I am reminded of another town And of a lovelier Helen , our dear Countess Julia Gonzaga . You remember , surely , The adventure with the corsair Barbarossa , And all that followed ?</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . A most strange adventure ; A tale as marvellous and full of wonder As any in Boccaccio or Sacchetti ; Almost incredible !</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . Were I a painter I should not want a better theme than that : The lovely lady fleeing through the night In wild disorder ; and the brigands ’ camp With the red fire-light on their swarthy faces . Could you not paint it for me ?</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . No , not I . It is not in my line .</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . Then you shall paint The portrait of the corsair , when we bring him A prisoner chained to Naples : for I feel Something like admiration for a man Who dared this strange adventure .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . I will do it . But catch the corsair first .</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . You may begin To-morrow with the sword . Hassan , come hither ; Bring me the Turkish scimitar that hangs Beneath the picture yonder . Now unsheathe it . ‘ T is a Damascus blade ; you see the inscription In Arabic : La Allah illa Allah ,— There is no God but God .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . How beautiful In fashion and in finish ! It is perfect . The Arsenal of Venice can not boast A finer sword .</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . You like it ? It is yours .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . You do not mean it .</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . I am not a Spaniard , To say that it is yours and not to mean it . I have at Itri a whole armory Full of such weapons . When you paint the portrait Of Barbarossa , it will be of use . You have not been rewarded as you should be For painting the Gonzaga . Throw this bauble Into the scale , and make the balance equal . Till then suspend it in your studio ; You artists like such trifles .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . I will keep it In memory of the donor . Many thanks .</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . Fra Bastian , I am growing tired of Rome , The old dead city , with the old dead people ; Priests everywhere , like shadows on a wall , And morning , noon , and night the ceaseless sound Of convent bells . I must be gone from here ; Though Ovid somewhere says that Rome is worthy To be the dwelling-place of all the Gods , I must be gone from here . To-morrow morning I start for Itri , and go thence by sea To join the Emperor , who is making war Upon the Algerines ; perhaps to sink Some Turkish galleys , and bring back in chains The famous corsair . Thus would I avenge The beautiful Gonzaga .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . An achievement Worthy of Charlemagne , or of Orlando . Berni and Ariosto both shall add A canto to their poems , and describe you As Furioso and Innamorato . Now I must say good-night .</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . You must not go ; First you shall sup with me . My seneschal Giovan Andrea dal Borgo a San Sepolcro ,— I like to give the whole sonorous name , It sounds so like a verse of the Aeneid ,— Has brought me eels fresh from the Lake of Fondi , And Lucrine oysters cradled in their shells : These , with red Fondi wine , the Caecu ban That Horace speaks of , under a hundred keys Kept safe , until the heir of Posthumus Shall stain the pavement with it , make a feast Fit for Lucullus , or Fra Bastian even ; So we will go to supper , and be merry .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . Beware ! I Remember that Bolsena 's eels And Vernage wine once killed a Pope of Rome !</p>
     <p>IPPOLITO . ‘ T was a French Pope ; and then so long ago ; Who knows ?— perhaps the story is not true .</p>

       <l n="1">Room in the Palace of JULIA GONZAGA . Night .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>JULIA GONZAGA , GIOVANNI VALDESSO .</head>
       <l n="1">JULIA .</l>
       <l n="2">Do not go yet .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>VALDESSO . The night is far advanced ; I fear to stay too late , and weary you With these discussions .</p>
     <p>JULIA . I have much to say . I speak to you , Valdesso , with that frankness Which is the greatest privilege of friendship .— Speak as I hardly would to my confessor , Such is my confidence in you .</p>
     <p>VALDESSO . Dear Countess If loyalty to friendship be a claim Upon your confidence , then I may claim it .</p>
     <p>JULIA . Then sit again , and listen unto things That nearer are to me than life itself .</p>
     <p>VALDESSO . In all things I am happy to obey you , And happiest then when you command me most .</p>
     <p>JULIA . Laying aside all useless rhetoric , That is superfluous between us two , I come at once unto the point and say , You know my outward life , my rank and fortune ; Countess of Fondi , Duchess of Trajetto , A widow rich and flattered , for whose hand In marriage princes ask , and ask it only To be rejected . All the world can offer Lies at my feet . If I remind you of it , It is not in the way of idle boasting , But only to the better understanding Of what comes after .</p>
     <p>VALDESSO . God hath given you also Beauty and intellect ; and the signal grace To lead a spotless life amid temptations , That others yield to .</p>
     <p>JULIA . But the inward life ,— That you know not ; ‘ t is known but to myself , And is to me a mystery and a pain . A soul disquieted , and ill at ease , A mind perplexed with doubts and apprehensions , A heart dissatisfied with all around me , And with myself , so that sometimes I weep , Discouraged and disgusted with the world .</p>
     <p>VALDESSO . Whene'er we cross a river at a ford , If we would pass in safety , we must keep Our eyes fixed steadfast on the shore beyond , For if we cast them on the flowing stream , The head swims with it ; so if we would cross The running flood of things here in the world , Our souls must not look down , but fix their sight On the firm land beyond .</p>
     <p>JULIA . I comprehend you . You think I am too worldly ; that my head Swims with the giddying whirl of life about me . Is that your meaning ?</p>
     <p>VALDESSO . Yes ; your meditations Are more of this world and its vanities Than of the world to come .</p>
     <p>JULIA . Between the two I am confused .</p>
     <p>VALDESSO . Yet have I seen you listen Enraptured when Fra Bernardino preached Of faith and hope and charity .</p>
     <p>JULIA . I listen , But only as to music without meaning . It moves me for the moment , and I think How beautiful it is to be a saint , As dear Vittoria is ; but I am weak And wayward , and I soon fall back again To my old ways , so very easily . There are too many week-days for one Sunday .</p>
     <p>VALDESSO . Then take the Sunday with you through the week , And sweeten with it all the other days .</p>
     <p>JULIA . In part I do so ; for to put a stop To idle tongues , what men might say of me If I lived all alone here in my palace , And not from a vocation that I feel For the monastic life , I now am living With Sister Caterina at the convent Of Santa Chiara , and I come here only On certain days , for my affairs , or visits Of ceremony , or to be with friends . For I confess , to live among my friends Is Paradise to me ; my Purgatory Is living among people I dislike . And so I pass my life in these two worlds , This palace and the convent .</p>
     <p>VALDESSO . It was then The fear of man , and not the love of God , That led you to this step . Why will you not Give all your heart to God ?</p>
     <p>JULIA . If God commands it , Wherefore hath He not made me capable Of doing for Him what I wish to do As easily as I could offer Him This jewel from my hand , this gown I wear , Or aught else that is mine ?</p>
     <p>VALDESSO . The hindrance lies In that original sin , by which all fell .</p>
     <p>JULIA . Ah me , I cannot bring my troubled mind To wish well to that Adam , our first parent , Who by his sin lost Paradise for us , And brought such ills upon us .</p>
     <p>VALDESSO . We ourselves , When we commit a sin , lose Paradise , As much as he did . Let us think of this , And how we may regain it .</p>
     <p>JULIA . Teach me , then , To harmonize the discord of my life , And stop the painful jangle of these wires .</p>
     <p>VALDESSO . That is a task impossible , until You tune your heart-strings to a higher key Than earthly melodies .</p>
     <p>JULIA . How shall I do it ? Point out to me the way of this perfection , And I will follow you ; for you have made My soul enamored with it , and I cannot Rest satisfied until I find it out . But lead me privately , so that the world Hear not my steps ; I would not give occasion For talk among the people .</p>
     <p>VALDESSO . Now at last I understand you fully . Then , what need Is there for us to beat about the bush ? I know what you desire of me .</p>
     <p>JULIA . What rudeness ! If you already know it , why not tell me ?</p>
     <p>VALDESSO . Because I rather wait for you to ask it With your own lips .</p>
     <p>JULIA . Do me the kindness , then , To speak without reserve ; and with all frankness , If you divine the truth , will I confess it .</p>
     <p>VALDESSO . I am content .</p>
     <p>JULIA . Then speak .</p>
     <p>VALDESSO . You would be free From the vexatious thoughts that come and go Through your imagination , and would have me Point out some royal road and lady-like Which you may walk in , and not wound your feet ; You would attain to the divine perfection , And yet not turn your back upon the world ; You would possess humility within , But not reveal it in your outward actions ; You would have patience , but without the rude Occasions that require its exercise ; You would despise the world , but in such fashion The world should not despise you in return ; Would clothe the soul with all the Christian graces , Yet not despoil the body of its gauds ; Would feed the soul with spiritual food , Yet not deprive the body of its feasts ; Would seem angelic in the sight of God , Yet not too saint-like in the eyes of men ; In short , would lead a holy Christian life In such a way that even your nearest friend Would not detect therein one circumstance To show a change from what it was before . Have I divined your secret ?</p>
     <p>JULIA . You have drawn The portrait of my inner self as truly As the most skilful painter ever painted A human face .</p>
     <p>VALDESSO . This warrants me in saying You think you can win heaven by compromise , And not by verdict .</p>
     <p>JULIA You have often told me That a bad compromise was better even Than a good verdict .</p>
     <p>VALDESSO . Yes , in suits at law ; Not in religion . With the human soul There is no compromise . By faith alone Can man be justified .</p>
     <p>JULIA . Hush , dear Valdesso ; That is a heresy . Do not , I pray you , Proclaim it from the house-top , but preserve it As something precious , hidden in your heart , As I , who half believe and tremble at it .</p>
     <p>VALDESSO . I must proclaim the truth .</p>
     <p>JULIA . Enthusiast ! Why must you ? You imperil both yourself And friends by your imprudence . Pray , be patient . You have occasion now to show that virtue Which you lay stress upon . Let us return To our lost pathway . Show me by what steps I shall walk in it . [ Convent bells are heard .</p>
     <p>VALDESSO . Hark ! the convent bells Are ringing ; it is midnight ; I must leave you . And yet I linger . Pardon me , dear Countess , Since you to-night have made me your confessor , If I so far may venture , I will warn you Upon one point .</p>
     <p>JULIA . What is it ? Speak , I pray you , For I have no concealments in my conduct ; All is as open as the light of day . What is it you would warn me of ?</p>
     <p>VALDESSO . Your friendship With Cardinal Ippolito .</p>
     <p>JULIA . What is there To cause suspicion or alarm in that , More than in friendships that I entertain With you and others ? I ne'er sat with him Alone at night , as I am sitting now With you , Valdesso .</p>
     <p>VALDESSO . Pardon me ; the portrait That Fra Bastiano painted was for him . Is that quite prudent ?</p>
     <p>JULIA . That is the same question Vittoria put to me , when I last saw her . I make you the same answer . That was not A pledge of love , but of pure gratitude . Recall the adventure of that dreadful night When Barbarossa with two thousand Moors Landed upon the coast , and in the darkness Attacked my castle . Then , without delay , The Cardinal came hurrying down from Rome To rescue and protect me . Was it wrong That in an hour like that I did not weigh Too nicely this or that , but granted him A boon that pleased him , and that flattered me ?</p>
     <p>VALDESSO . Only beware lest , in disguise of friendship Another corsair , worse than Barbarossa , Steal in and seize the castle , not by storm But strategy . And now I take my leave .</p>
     <p>JULIA . Farewell ; but ere you go look forth and see How night hath hushed the clamor and the stir Of the tumultuous streets . The cloudless moon Roofs the whole city as with tiles of silver ; The dim , mysterious sea in silence sleeps ; And straight into the air Vesuvius lifts His plume of smoke . How beautiful it is ! [ Voices in the street .</p>
     <p>GIOVAN ANDREA . Poisoned at Itri .</p>
     <p>ANOTHER VOICE . Poisoned ? Who is poisoned ?</p>
     <p>GIOVAN ANDREA . The Cardinal Ippolito , my master . Call it malaria . It was sudden . [ Julia swoons .</p>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>VITTORIA . Come to my arms and to my heart once more ; My soul goes out to meet you and embrace you , For we are of the sisterhood of sorrow . I know what you have suffered .</p>
     <p>JULIA . Name it not . Let me forget it .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . I will say no more . Let me look at you . What a joy it is To see your face , to hear your voice again ! You bring with you a breath as of the morn , A memory of the far-off happy days When we were young . When did you come from Fondi ?</p>
     <p>JULIA . I have not been at Fondi since —</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . Ah me ! You need not speak the word ; I understand you .</p>
     <p>JULIA . I came from Naples by the lovely valley The Terra di Lavoro .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . And you find me But just returned from a long journey northward . I have been staying with that noble woman Renee of France , the Duchess of Ferrara .</p>
     <p>JULIA . Oh , tell me of the Duchess . I have heard Flaminio speak her praises with such warmth That I am eager to hear more of her And of her brilliant court .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . You shall hear all But first sit down and listen patiently While I confess myself .</p>
     <p>JULIA . What deadly sin Have you committed ?</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . Not a sin ; a folly I chid you once at Ischia , when you told me That brave Fra Bastian was to paint your portrait .</p>
     <p>JULIA Well I remember it .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . Then chide me now , For I confess to something still more strange . Old as I am , I have at last consented To the entreaties and the supplications Of Michael Angelo —</p>
     <p>JULIA To marry him ?</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . I pray you , do not jest with me ! You now , Or you should know , that never such a thought Entered my breast . I am already married . The Marquis of Pescara is my husband , And death has not divorced us .</p>
     <p>JULIA . Pardon me . Have I offended you ?</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . No , but have hurt me . Unto my buried lord I give myself , Unto my friend the shadow of myself , My portrait . It is not from vanity , But for the love I bear him .</p>
     <p>JULIA . I rejoice To hear these words . Oh , this will be a portrait Worthy of both of you ! [ A knock .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . Hark ! He is coming .</p>
     <p>JULIA . And shall I go or stay ?</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . By all means , stay . The drawing will be better for your presence ; You will enliven me .</p>
     <p>JULIA . I shall not speak ; The presence of great men doth take from me All power of speech . I only gaze at them In silent wonder , as if they were gods , Or the inhabitants of some other planet .</p>
     <p>Enter MICHAEL ANGELO .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . Come in .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . I fear my visit is ill-timed ; I interrupt you .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . No ; this is a friend Of yours as well as mine ,— the Lady Julia , The Duchess of Trajetto .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">MICHAEL ANGELO to JULIA .</l>
       <l n="2">I salute you .</l>
       <l n="3">‘ T is long since I have seen your face , my lady ;</l>
       <l n="4">Pardon me if I say that having seen it ,</l>
       <l n="5">One never can forget it .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>JULIA . You are kind To keep me in your memory .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . It is The privilege of age to speak with frankness . You will not be offended when I say That never was your beauty more divine .</p>
     <p>JULIA . When Michael Angelo condescends to flatter Or praise me , I am proud , and not offended .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . Now this is gallantry enough for one ; Show me a little .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Ah , my gracious lady , You know I have not words to speak your praise . I think of you in silence . You conceal Your manifold perfections from all eyes , And make yourself more saint-like day by day . And day by day men worship you the wore . But now your hour of martyrdom has come . You know why I am here .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . Ah yes , I know it , And meet my fate with fortitude . You find me Surrounded by the labors of your hands : The Woman of Samaria at the Well , The Mater Dolorosa , and the Christ Upon the Cross , beneath which you have written Those memorable words of Alighieri , “ Men have forgotten how much blood it costs . ”</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . And now I come to add one labor more , If you will call that labor which is pleasure , And only pleasure .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . How shall I be seated ?</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO , opening his portfolio .</p>
     <p>Just as you are . The light falls well upon you .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . I am ashamed to steal the time from you That should be given to the Sistine Chapel . How does that work go on ?</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">MICHAEL ANGELO , drawing .</l>
       <l n="2">But tardily .</l>
       <l n="3">Old men work slowly . Brain and hand alike</l>
       <l n="4">Are dull and torpid . To die young is best ,</l>
       <l n="5">And not to be remembered as old men</l>
       <l n="6">Tottering about in their decrepitude .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>VITTORIA . My dear Maestro ! have you , then , forgotten The story of Sophocles in his old age ?</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . What story is it ?</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . When his sons accused him , Before the Areopagus , of dotage , For all defence , he read there to his Judges The Tragedy of Oedipus Coloneus ,— The work of his old age .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . ‘ T is an illusion A fabulous story , that will lead old men Into a thousand follies and conceits .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . So you may show to cavilers your painting Of the Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Now you and Lady Julia shall resume The conversation that I interrupted .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . It was of no great import ; nothing more Nor less than my late visit to Ferrara , And what I saw there in the ducal palace . Will it not interrupt you ?</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Not the least .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . Well , first , then , of Duke Ercole : a man Cold in his manners , and reserved and silent , And yet magnificent in all his ways ; Not hospitable unto new ideas , But from state policy , and certain reasons Concerning the investiture of the duchy , A partisan of Rome , and consequently Intolerant of all the new opinions .</p>
     <p>JULIA . I should not like the Duke . These silent men , Who only look and listen , are like wells That have no water in them , deep and empty . How could the daughter of a king of France Wed such a duke ?</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . The men that women marry And why they marry them , will always be A marvel and a mystery to the world .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . And then the Duchess ,— how shall I describe her , Or tell the merits of that happy nature , Which pleases most when least it thinks of pleasing ? Not beautiful , perhaps , in form and feature , Yet with an inward beauty , that shines through Each look and attitude and word and gesture ; A kindly grace of manner and behavior , A something in her presence and her ways That makes her beautiful beyond the reach Of mere external beauty ; and in heart So noble and devoted to the truth , And so in sympathy with all who strive After the higher life .</p>
     <p>JULIA . She draws me to her As much as her Duke Ercole repels me .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . Then the devout and honorable women That grace her court , and make it good to be there ; Francesca Bucyronia , the true-hearted , Lavinia della Rovere and the Orsini , The Magdalena and the Cherubina , And Anne de Parthenai , who sings so sweetly ; All lovely women , full of noble thoughts And aspirations after noble things .</p>
     <p>JULIA . Boccaccio would have envied you such dames .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . No ; his Fiammettas and his Philomenas Are fitter company for Ser Giovanni ; I fear he hardly would have comprehended The women that I speak of .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Yet he wrote The story of Griselda . That is something To set down in his favor .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . With these ladies Was a young girl , Olympia Morate , Daughter of Fulvio , the learned scholar , Famous in all the universities . A marvellous child , who at the spinning wheel , And in the daily round of household cares , Hath learned both Greek and Latin ; and is now A favorite of the Duchess and companion Of Princess Anne . This beautiful young Sappho Sometimes recited to us Grecian odes That she had written , with a voice whose sadness Thrilled and o'ermastered me , and made me look Into the future time , and ask myself What destiny will be hers .</p>
     <p>JULIA . A sad one , surely . Frost kills the flowers that blossom out of season ; And these precocious intellects portend A life of sorrow or an early death .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . About the court were many learned men ; Chilian Sinapius from beyond the Alps , And Celio Curione , and Manzolli , The Duke 's physician ; and a pale young man , Charles d'Espeville of Geneva , whom the Duchess Doth much delight to talk with and to read , For he hath written a book of Institutes The Duchess greatly praises , though some call it The Koran of the heretics .</p>
     <p>JULIA . And what poets Were there to sing you madrigals , and praise Olympia 's eyes and Cherubina 's tresses ?</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . No ; for great Ariosto is no more . The voice that filled those halls with melody Has long been hushed in death .</p>
     <p>JULIA . You should have made A pilgrimage unto the poet 's tomb , And laid a wreath upon it , for the words He spake of you .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . And of yourself no less , And of our master , Michael Angelo .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Of me ?</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . Have you forgotten that he calls you Michael , less man than angel , and divine ? You are ungrateful .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . A mere play on words . That adjective he wanted for a rhyme , To match with Gian Bellino and Urbino .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . Bernardo Tasso is no longer there , Nor the gay troubadour of Gascony , Clement Marot , surnamed by flatterers The Prince of Poets and the Poet of Princes , Who , being looked upon with much disfavor By the Duke Ercole , has fled to Venice .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . There let him stay with Pietro Aretino , The Scourge of Princes , also called Divine . The title is so common in our mouths , That even the Pifferari of Abruzzi , Who play their bag-pipes in the streets of Rome At the Epiphany , will bear it soon , And will deserve it better than some poets .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . What bee hath stung you ?</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . One that makes no honey ; One that comes buzzing in through every window , And stabs men with his sting . A bitter thought Passed through my mind , but it is gone again ; I spake too hastily .</p>
     <p>JULIA . I pray you , show me What you have done .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Not yet ; it is not finished .</p>

     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Fled to Viterbo , the old Papal city Where once an Emperor , humbled in his pride , Held the Pope 's stirrup , as his Holiness Alighted from his mule ! A fugitive From Cardinal Caraffa 's hate , who hurls His thunders at the house of the Colonna , With endless bitterness !— Among the nuns In Santa Catarina 's convent hidden , Herself in soul a nun ! And now she chides me For my too frequent letters , that disturb Her meditations , and that hinder me And keep me from my work ; now graciously She thanks me for the crucifix I sent her , And says that she will keep it : with one hand Inflicts a wound , and with the other heals it .

Who shall say That from the world of spirits comes no greeting , No message of remembrance ? It may be The thoughts that visit us , we know not whence , Sudden as inspiration , are the whispers Of disembodied spirits , speaking to us As friends , who wait outside a prison wall , Through the barred windows speak to those within .

      <head>MICHAEL ANGELO AND BENVENUTO CELLINI</head>
       <l n="1">MICHAEL ANGELO , BENVENUTO CELLINI in gay attire .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>BENVENUTO . A good day and good year to the divine Maestro Michael Angelo , the sculptor !</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Welcome , my Benvenuto .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . That is what My father said , the first time he beheld This handsome face . But say farewell , not welcome . I come to take my leave . I start for Florence As fast as horse can carry me . I long To set once more upon its level flags These feet , made sore by your vile Roman pavements . Come with me ; you are wanted there in Florence . The Sacristy is not finished .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Speak not of it ! How damp and cold it was ! How my bones ached And my head reeled , when I was working there ! I am too old . I will stay here in Rome , Where all is old and crumbling , like myself , To hopeless ruin . All roads lead to Rome .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . And all lead out of it .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . There is a charm , A certain something in the atmosphere , That all men feel , and no man can describe .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . Malaria ?</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Yes , malaria of the mind , Out of this tomb of the majestic Past ! The fever to accomplish some great work That will not let us sleep . I must go on Until I die .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . Do you ne'er think of Florence ?</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Yes ; whenever I think of anything beside my work , I think of Florence . I remember , too , The bitter days I passed among the quarries Of Seravezza and Pietrasanta ; Road-building in the marshes ; stupid people , And cold and rain incessant , and mad gusts Of mountain wind , like howling dervishes , That spun and whirled the eddying snow about them As if it were a garment ; aye , vexations And troubles of all kinds , that ended only In loss of time and money .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . True ; Maestro , But that was not in Florence . You should leave Such work to others . Sweeter memories Cluster about you , in the pleasant city Upon the Arno .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . In my waking dreams I see the marvellous dome of Brunelleschi , Ghiberti 's gates of bronze , and Giotto 's tower ; And Ghirlandajo 's lovely Benci glides With folded hands amid my troubled thoughts , A splendid vision ! Time rides with the old At a great pace . As travellers on swift steeds See the near landscape fly and flow behind them , While the remoter fields and dim horizons Go with them , and seem wheeling round to meet them , So in old age things near us slip away , And distant things go with as . Pleasantly Come back to me the days when , as a youth , I walked with Ghirlandajo in the gardens Of Medici , and saw the antique statues , The forms august of gods and godlike men , And the great world of art revealed itself To my young eyes . Then all that man hath done Seemed possible to me . Alas ! how little Of all I dreamed of has my hand achieved !</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . Nay , let the Night and Morning , let Lorenzo And Julian in the Sacristy at Florence , Prophets and Sibyls in the Sistine Chapel , And the Last Judgment answer . Is it finished ?</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . The work is nearly done . But this Last Judgment Has been the cause of more vexation to me Than it will be of honor . Ser Biagio , Master of ceremonies at the Papal court , A man punctilious and over nice , Calls it improper ; says that those nude forms , Showing their nakedness in such shameless fashion , Are better suited to a common bagnio , Or wayside wine-shop , than a Papal Chapel . To punish him I painted him as Minos And leave him there as master of ceremonies In the Infernal Regions . What would you Have done to such a man ?</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . I would have killed him . When any one insults me , if I can I kill him , kill him .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Oh , you gentlemen , Who dress in silks and velvets , and wear swords , Are ready with your weapon ; and have all A taste for homicide .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . I learned that lesson Under Pope Clement at the siege of Rome , Some twenty years ago . As I was standing Upon the ramparts of the Campo Santo With Alessandro Bene , I beheld A sea of fog , that covered all the plain , And hid from us the foe ; when suddenly , A misty figure , like an apparition , Rose up above the fog , as if on horseback . At this I aimed my arquebus , and fired . The figure vanished ; and there rose a cry Out of the darkness , long and fierce and loud , With imprecations in all languages . It was the Constable of France , the Bourbon , That I had slain .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Rome should be grateful to you .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . But has not been ; you shall hear presently . During the siege I served as bombardier , There in St. Angelo . His Holiness , One day , was walking with his Cardinals On the round bastion , while I stood above Among my falconets . All thought and feeling , All skill in art and all desire of fame , Were swallowed up in the delightful music Of that artillery . I saw far off , Within the enemy 's trenches on the Prati , A Spanish cavalier in scarlet cloak ; And firing at him with due aim and range , I cut the gay Hidalgo in two pieces . The eyes are dry that wept for him in Spain . His Holiness , delighted beyond measure With such display of gunnery , and amazed To see the man in scarlet cut in two , Gave me his benediction , and absolved me From all the homicides I had committed In service of the Apostolic Church , Or should commit thereafter . From that day I have not held in very high esteem The life of man .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . And who absolved Pope Clement ? Now let us speak of Art .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . Of what you will .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Say , have you seen our friend Fra Bastian lately , Since by a turn of fortune he became Friar of the Signet ?</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . Faith , a pretty artist To pass his days in stamping leaden seals On Papal bulls !</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . He has grown fat and lazy , As if the lead clung to him like a sinker . He paints no more , since he was sent to Fondi By Cardinal Ippolito to paint The fair Gonzaga . Ah , you should have seen him As I did , riding through the city gate , In his brown hood , attended by four horsemen , Completely armed , to frighten the banditti . I think he would have frightened them alone , For he was rounder than the O of Giotto .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . He must have looked more like a sack of meal Than a great painter .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Well , he is not great But still I like him greatly . Benvenuto Have faith in nothing but in industry . Be at it late and early ; persevere , And work right on through censure and applause , Or else abandon Art .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . No man works harder Then I do . I am not a moment idle .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . And what have you to show me ?</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . This gold ring , Made for his Holiness ,— my latest work , And I am proud of it . A single diamond Presented by the Emperor to the Pope . Targhetta of Venice set and tinted it ; I have reset it , and retinted it Divinely , as you see . The jewellers Say I 've surpassed Targhetta .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Let me see it . A pretty jewel .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . That is not the expression . Pretty is not a very pretty word To be applied to such a precious stone , Given by an Emperor to a Pope , and set By Benvenuto !</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Messer Benvenuto , I lose all patience with you ; for the gifts That God hath given you are of such a kind , They should be put to far more noble uses Than setting diamonds for the Pope of Rome . You can do greater things .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . The God who made me Knows why he made me what I am ,— a goldsmith , A mere artificer .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Oh no ; an artist Richly endowed by nature , but who wraps His talent in a napkin , and consumes His life in vanities .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . Michael Angelo May say what Benvenuto would not bear From any other man . He speaks the truth . I know my life is wasted and consumed In vanities ; but I have better hours And higher aspirations than you think . Once , when a prisoner at St. Angelo , Fasting and praying in the midnight darkness , In a celestial vision I beheld A crucifix in the sun , of the same substance As is the sun itself . And since that hour There is a splendor round about my head , That may be seen at sunrise and at sunset Above my shadow on the grass . And now I know that I am in the grace of God , And none henceforth can harm me .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . None but one ,— None but yourself , who are your greatest foe . He that respects himself is safe from others ; He wears a coat of mail that none can pierce .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . I always wear one .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . O incorrigible ! At least , forget not the celestial vision . Man must have something higher than himself To think of .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . That I know full well . Now listen . I have been sent for into France , where grow The Lilies that illumine heaven and earth , And carry in mine equipage the model Of a most marvellous golden salt-cellar For the king 's table ; and here in my brain A statue of Mars Armipotent for the fountain Of Fontainebleau , colossal , wonderful . I go a goldsmith , to return a sculptor . And so farewell , great Master . Think of me As one who , in the midst of all his follies , Had also his ambition , and aspired To better things .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Do not forget the vision .</p>

     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . Wait , for I am out of breath In climbing your steep stairs .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Ah , my Bastiano , If you went up and down as many stairs As I do still , and climbed as many ladders , It would be better for you . Pray sit down . Your idle and luxurious way of living Will one day take your breath away entirely . And you will never find it .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . Well , what then ? That would be better , in my apprehension , Than falling from a scaffold .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . That was nothing It did not kill me ; only lamed me slightly ; I am quite well again .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . But why , dear Master , Why do you live so high up in your house , When you could live below and have a garden , As I do ?</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . From this window I can look On many gardens ; o'er the city roofs See the Campagna and the Alban hills ; And all are mine .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . Can you sit down in them , On summer afternoons , and play the lute Or sing , or sleep the time away ?</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . I never Sleep in the day-time ; scarcely sleep at night . I have not time . Did you meet Benvenuto As you came up the stair ?</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . He ran against me On the first landing , going at full speed ; Dressed like the Spanish captain in a play , With his long rapier and his short red cloak . Why hurry through the world at such a pace ? Life will not be too long .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . It is his nature ,— A restless spirit , that consumes itself With useless agitations . He o'erleaps The goal he aims at . Patience is a plant That grows not in all gardens . You are made Of quite another clay .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . And thank God for it . And now , being somewhat rested , I will tell you Why I have climbed these formidable stairs . I have a friend , Francesco Berni , here , A very charming poet and companion , Who greatly honors you and all your doings , And you must sup with us .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Not I , indeed . I know too well what artists ’ suppers are . You must excuse me .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . I will not excuse you . You need repose from your incessant work ; Some recreation , some bright hours of pleasure .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . To me , what you and other men call pleasure Is only pain . Work is my recreation , The play of faculty ; a delight like that Which a bird feels in flying , or a fish In darting through the water ,— nothing more . I cannot go . The Sibylline leaves of life Grow precious now , when only few remain . I cannot go .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . Berni , perhaps , will read A canto of the Orlando Inamorato .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . That is another reason for not going . If aught is tedious and intolerable , It is a poet reading his own verses ,</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . Berni thinks somewhat better of your verses Than you of his . He says that you speak things , And other poets words . So , pray you , come .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . If it were now the Improvisatore , Luigia Pulci , whom I used to hear With Benvenuto , in the streets of Florence , I might be tempted . I was younger then And singing in the open air was pleasant .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . There is a Frenchman here , named Rabelais , Once a Franciscan friar , and now a doctor , And secretary to the embassy : A learned man , who speaks all languages , And wittiest of men ; who wrote a book Of the Adventures of Gargantua , So full of strange conceits one roars with laughter At every page ; a jovial boon-companion And lover of much wine . He too is coming .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Then you will not want me , who am not witty , And have no sense of mirth , and love not wine . I should be like a dead man at your banquet . Why should I seek this Frenchman , Rabelais ? And wherefore go to hear Francesco Berni , When I have Dante Alighieri here . The greatest of all poets ?</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . And the dullest ; And only to be read in episodes . His day is past . Petrarca is our poet .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Petrarca is for women and for lovers And for those soft Abati , who delight To wander down long garden walks in summer , Tinkling their little sonnets all day long , As lap dogs do their bells .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . I love Petrarca . How sweetly of his absent love he sings When journeying in the forest of Ardennes ! “ I seem to hear her , hearing the boughs and breezes And leaves and birds lamenting , and the waters Murmuring flee along the verdant herbage . ”</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Enough . It is all seeming , and no being . If you would know how a man speaks in earnest , Read here this passage , where St. Peter thunders In Paradise against degenerate Popes And the corruptions of the church , till all The heaven about him blushes like a sunset . I beg you to take note of what he says About the Papal seals , for that concerns Your office and yourself .</p>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . Vituperation ; gall that might have spirited From Aretino 's pen .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Name not that man ! A profligate , whom your Francesco Berni Describes as having one foot in the brothel And the other in the hospital ; who lives By flattering or maligning , as best serves His purpose at the time . He writes to me With easy arrogance of my Last Judgment , In such familiar tone that one would say The great event already had occurred , And he was present , and from observation Informed me how the picture should be painted .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . What unassuming , unobtrusive men These critics are ! Now , to have Aretino Aiming his shafts at you brings back to mind The Gascon archers in the square of Milan , Shooting their arrows at Duke Sforza 's statue , By Leonardo , and the foolish rabble Of envious Florentines , that at your David Threw stones at night . But Aretino praised you .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . His praises were ironical . He knows How to use words as weapons , and to wound While seeming to defend . But look , Bastiano , See how the setting sun lights up that picture !</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . My portrait of Vittoria Colonna .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . It makes her look as she will look hereafter , When she becomes a saint !</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . A noble woman !</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Ah , these old hands can fashion fairer shapes In marble , and can paint diviner pictures , Since I have known her .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . And you like this picture . And yet it is in oil ; which you detest .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . When that barbarian Jan Van Eyck discovered The use of oil in painting , he degraded His art into a handicraft , and made it Sign-painting , merely , for a country inn Or wayside wine-shop . ‘ T is an art for women , Or for such leisurely and idle people As you , Fra Bastiano . Nature paints not In oils , but frescoes the great dome of heaven With sunset ; and the lovely forms of clouds And flying vapors .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . And how soon they fade ! Behold yon line of roofs and belfries painted Upon the golden background of the sky , Like a Byzantine picture , or a portrait Of Cimabue . See how hard the outline , Sharp-cut and clear , not rounded into shadow . Yet that is nature .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . She is always right . The picture that approaches sculpture nearest Is the best picture .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . Leonardo thinks The open air too bright . We ought to paint As if the sun were shining through a mist . ‘ T is easier done in oil than in distemper .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Do not revive again the old dispute ; I have an excellent memory for forgetting , But I still feel the hurt . Wounds are not healed By the unbending of the bow that made them .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . So say Petrarca and the ancient proverb .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . But that is past . Now I am angry with you , Not that you paint in oils , but that grown fat And indolent , you do not paint at all .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . Why should I paint ? Why should I toil and sweat , Who now am rich enough to live at ease , And take my pleasure ?</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . When Pope Leo died , He who had been so lavish of the wealth His predecessors left him , who received A basket of gold-pieces every morning , Which every night was empty , left behind Hardly enough to pay his funeral .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . I care for banquets , not for funerals , As did his Holiness . I have forbidden All tapers at my burial , and procession Of priests and friars and monks ; and have provided The cost thereof be given to the poor !</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . You have done wisely , but of that I speak not . Ghiberti left behind him wealth and children ; But who to-day would know that he had lived , If he had never made those gates of bronze In the old Baptistery ,— those gates of bronze , Worthy to be the gates of Paradise . His wealth is scattered to the winds ; his children Are long since dead ; but those celestial gates Survive , and keep his name and memory green .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . But why should I fatigue myself ? I think That all things it is possible to paint Have been already painted ; and if not , Why , there are painters in the world at present Who can accomplish more in two short months Than I could in two years ; so it is well That some one is contented to do nothing , And leave the field to others .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . O blasphemer ! Not without reason do the people call you Sebastian del Piombo , for the lead Of all the Papal bulls is heavy upon you , And wraps you like a shroud .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . Misericordia ! Sharp is the vinegar of sweet wine , and sharp The words you speak , because the heart within you Is sweet unto the core .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . How changed you are From the Sebastiano I once knew , When poor , laborious , emulous to excel , You strove in rivalry with Badassare And Raphael Sanzio .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . Raphael is dead ; He is but dust and ashes in his grave , While I am living and enjoying life , And so am victor . One live Pope is worth A dozen dead ones .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Raphael is not dead ; He doth but sleep ; for how can he be dead Who lives immortal in the hearts of men ? He only drank the precious wine of youth , The outbreak of the grapes , before the vintage Was trodden to bitterness by the feet of men . The gods have given him sleep . We never were Nor could be foes , although our followers , Who are distorted shadows of ourselves , Have striven to make us so ; but each one worked Unconsciously upon the other 's thought ; Both giving and receiving . He perchance Caught strength from me , and I some greater sweetness And tenderness from his more gentle nature . I have but words of praise and admiration For his great genius ; and the world is fairer That he lived in it .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . We at least are friends ; So come with me .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . No , no ; I am best pleased When I 'm not asked to banquets . I have reached A time of life when daily walks are shortened , And even the houses of our dearest friends , That used to be so near , seem far away .</p>
     <p>FRA SEBASTIANO . Then we must sup without you . We shall laugh At those who toil for fame , and make their lives A tedious martyrdom , that they may live A little longer in the mouths of men ! And so , good-night .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Good-night , my Fra Bastiano .</p>

     <p>PALAZZO BELVEDERE</p>
     <p>TITIAN 'S studio . A painting of Danae with a curtain before it . TITIAN , MICHAEL ANGELO , and GIORGIO VASARI .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . So you have left at last your still lagoons , Your City of Silence floating in the sea , And come to us in Rome .</p>
     <p>TITIAN . I come to learn , But I have come too late . I should have seen Rome in my youth , when all my mind was open To new impressions . Our Vasari here Leads me about , a blind man , groping darkly Among the marvels of the past . I touch them , But do not see them .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . There are things in Rome That one might walk bare-footed here from Venice But to see once , and then to die content .</p>
     <p>TITIAN . I must confess that these majestic ruins Oppress me with their gloom . I feel as one Who in the twilight stumbles among tombs , And cannot read the inscriptions carved upon them .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . I felt so once ; but I have grown familiar With desolation , and it has become No more a pain to me , but a delight .</p>
     <p>TITIAN . I could not live here . I must have the sea , And the sea-mist , with sunshine interwoven Like cloth of gold ; must have beneath my windows The laughter of the waves , and at my door Their pattering footsteps , or I am not happy .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Then tell me of your city in the sea , Paved with red basalt of the Paduan hills . Tell me of art in Venice . Three great names , Giorgione , Titian , and the Tintoretto , Illustrate your Venetian school , and send A challenge to the world . The first is dead , But Tintoretto lives .</p>
     <p>TITIAN . And paints with fires Sudden and splendid , as the lightning paints The cloudy vault of heaven .</p>
     <p>GIORGIO . Does he still keep Above his door the arrogant inscription That once was painted there ,— “ The color of Titian , With the design of Michael Angelo ” ?</p>
     <p>TITIAN . Indeed , I know not . ‘ T was a foolish boast , And does no harm to any but himself . Perhaps he has grown wiser .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . When you two Are gone , who is there that remains behind To seize the pencil falling from your fingers ?</p>
     <p>GIORGIO . Oh there are many hands upraised already To clutch at such a prize , which hardly wait For death to loose your grasp ,— a hundred of them ; Schiavone , Bonifazio , Campagnola , Moretto , and Moroni ; who can count them , Or measure their ambition ?</p>
     <p>TITIAN . When we are gone The generation that comes after us Will have far other thoughts than ours . Our ruins Will serve to build their palaces or tombs . They will possess the world that we think ours , And fashion it far otherwise .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . I hear Your son Orazio and your nephew Marco Mentioned with honor .</p>
     <p>TITIAN . Ay , brave lads , brave lads . But time will show . There is a youth in Venice , One Paul Cagliari , called the Veronese , Still a mere stripling , but of such rare promise That we must guard our laurels , or may lose them .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . These are good tidings ; for I sometimes fear That , when we die , with us all art will die . ‘ T is but a fancy . Nature will provide Others to take our places . I rejoice To see the young spring forward in the race , Eager as we were , and as full of hope And the sublime audacity of youth .</p>
     <p>TITIAN . Men die and are forgotten . The great world Goes on the same . Among the myriads Of men that live , or have lived , or shall live What is a single life , or thine or mime , That we should think all nature would stand still If we were gone ? We must make room for others .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . And now , Maestro , pray unveil your picture Of Danae , of which I hear such praise .</p>
     <p>TITIAN , drawing hack the curtain .</p>
     <p>What think you ?</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . That Acrisius did well To lock such beauty in a brazen tower And hide it from all eyes .</p>
     <p>TITIAN . The model truly Was beautiful .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . And more , that you were present , And saw the showery Jove from high Olympus Descend in all his splendor .</p>
     <p>TITIAN . From your lips Such words are full of sweetness .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . You have caught These golden hues from your Venetian sunsets .</p>
     <p>TITIAN . Possibly .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Or from sunshine through a shower On the lagoons , or the broad Adriatic . Nature reveals herself in all our arts . The pavements and the palaces of cities Hint at the nature of the neighboring hills . Red lavas from the Euganean quarries Of Padua pave your streets ; your palaces Are the white stones of Istria , and gleam Reflected in your waters and your pictures . And thus the works of every artist show Something of his surroundings and his habits . The uttermost that can be reached by color Is here accomplished . Warmth and light and softness Mingle together . Never yet was flesh Painted by hand of artist , dead or living , With such divine perfection .</p>
     <p>TITIAN . I am grateful For so much praise from you , who are a master ; While mostly those who praise and those who blame Know nothing of the matter , so that mainly Their censure sounds like praise , their praise like censure .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Wonderful ! wonderful ! The charm of color Fascinates me the more that in myself The gift is wanting . I am not a painter .</p>
     <p>GIORGIO . Messer Michele , all the arts are yours , Not one alone ; and therefore I may venture To put a question to you .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Well , speak on .</p>
     <p>GIORGIO . Two nephews of the Cardinal Farnese Have made me umpire in dispute between them Which is the greater of the sister arts , Painting or sculpture . Solve for me the doubt .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Sculpture and painting have a common goal , And whosoever would attain to it , Whichever path he take , will find that goal Equally hard to reach .</p>
     <p>GIORGIO . No doubt , no doubt ; But you evade the question .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . When I stand In presence of this picture , I concede That painting has attained its uttermost ; But in the presence of my sculptured figures I feel that my conception soars beyond All limit I have reached .</p>
     <p>GIORGIO . You still evade me .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Giorgio Vasari , I have often said That I account that painting as the best Which most resembles sculpture . Here before us We have the proof . Behold those rounded limbs ! How from the canvas they detach themselves , Till they deceive the eye , and one would say , It is a statue with a screen behind it !</p>
     <p>TITIAN . Signori , pardon me ; but all such questions Seem to me idle .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Idle as the wind . And now , Maestro , I will say once more How admirable I esteem your work , And leave you , without further interruption .</p>
     <p>TITIAN . Your friendly visit hath much honored me .</p>
     <p>GIOROIO . Farewell .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO to GIORGIO , going out .</p>

     <p>JULIA . Well I remember ; but it seems to me Something unreal , that has never been ,— Something that I have read of in a book , Or heard of some one else .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . Ten years and more Have passed since then ; and many things have happened In those ten years , and many friends have died : Marco Flaminio , whom we all admired And loved as our Catullus ; dear Valldesso , The noble champion of free thought and speech ; And Cardinal Ippolito , your friend .</p>
     <p>JULIA . Oh , do not speak of him ! His sudden death O'ercomes me now , as it o'ercame me then . Let me forget it ; for my memory Serves me too often as an unkind friend , And I remember things I would forget , While I forget the things I would remember .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . Forgive me ; I will speak of him no more , The good Fra Bernardino has departed , Has fled from Italy , and crossed the Alps , Fearing Caraffa 's wrath , because he taught That He who made us all without our help Could also save us without aid of ours . Renee of France , the Duchess of Ferrara , That Lily of the Loire , is bowed by winds That blow from Rome ; Olympia Morata Banished from court because of this new doctrine . Therefore be cautious . Keep your secret thought Locked in your breast .</p>
     <p>JULIA . I will be very prudent But speak no more , I pray ; it wearies you .</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . Yes , I am very weary . Read to me .</p>
     <p>JULIA . Most willingly . What shall I read ?</p>
     <p>VITTORIA . Petrarca 's Triumph of Death . The book lies on the table ; Beside the casket there . Read where you find The leaf turned down . ‘ T was there I left off reading .</p>

If the thought Could , like a windlass , lift the ponderous stones And swing them to their places ; if a breath Could blow this rounded dome into the air , As if it were a bubble , and these statues Spring at a signal to their sacred stations , As sentinels mount guard upon a wall . Then were my task completed . Now , alas ! Naught am I but a Saint Sebaldus , holding Upon his hand the model of a church , As German artists paint him ; and what years , What weary years , must drag themselves along , Ere this be turned to stone ! What hindrances Must block the way ; what idle interferences Of Cardinals and Canons of St. Peter 's , Who nothing know of art beyond the color Of cloaks and stockings , nor of any building Save that of their own fortunes ! And what then ? I must then the short-coming of my means Piece out by stepping forward , as the Spartan Was told to add a step to his short sword .</p>
     <p>[ A pause .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">And is Fra Bastian dead ? Is all that light</l>
       <l n="2">Gone out , that sunshine darkened ; all that music</l>
       <l n="3">And merriment , that used to make our lives</l>
       <l n="4">Less melancholy , swallowed up in silence</l>
       <l n="5">Like madrigals sung in the street at night</l>
       <l n="6">By passing revellers ? It is strange indeed</l>
       <l n="7">That he should die before me . ‘ T is against</l>
       <l n="8">The laws of nature that the young should die ,</l>
       <l n="9">And the old live ; unless it be that some</l>
       <l n="10">Have long been dead who think themselves alive ,</l>
       <l n="11">Because not buried . Well , what matters it ,</l>
       <l n="12">Since now that greater light , that was my sun ,</l>
       <l n="13">Is set , and all is darkness , all is darkness !</l>
       <l n="14">Death 's lightnings strike to right and left of me ,</l>
       <l n="15">And , like a ruined wall , the world around me</l>
       <l n="16">Crumbles away , and I am left alone .</l>
       <l n="17">I have no friends , and want none . My own thoughts</l>
       <l n="18">Are now my sole companions ,— thoughts of her ,</l>
       <l n="19">That like a benediction from the skies</l>
       <l n="20">Come to me in my solitude and soothe me .</l>
       <l n="21">When men are old , the incessant thought of Death</l>
       <l n="22">Follows them like their shadow ; sits with them</l>
       <l n="23">At every meal ; sleeps with them when they sleep ;</l>
       <l n="24">And when they wake already is awake ,</l>
       <l n="25">And standing by their bedside . Then , what folly</l>
       <l n="26">It is in us to make an enemy</l>
       <l n="27">Of this importunate follower , not a friend !</l>
       <l n="28">To me a friend , and not an enemy ,</l>
       <l n="29">Has he become since all my friends are dead .</l>

      <head>VIGNA DI PAPA GIULIO</head>
       <l n="1">POPE JULIUS III . seated by the Fountain of Acqua Vergine ,</l>
       <l n="2">surrounded by Cardinals .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>JULIUS . Tell me , why is it ye are discontent , You , Cardinals Salviati and Marcello , With Michael Angelo ? What has he done , Or left undone , that ye are set against him ? When one Pope dies , another is soon made ; And I can make a dozen Cardinals , But cannot make one Michael Angelo .</p>
     <p>CARDINAL SALVIATI . Your Holiness , we are not set against him ; We but deplore his incapacity . He is too old .</p>
     <p>JULIUS . You , Cardinal Salviati , Are an old man . Are you incapable ? ‘ T is the old ox that draws the straightest furrow .</p>
     <p>CARDINAL MARCELLO . Your Holiness remembers he was charged With the repairs upon St. Mary 's bridge ; Made cofferdams , and heaped up load on load Of timber and travertine ; and yet for years The bridge remained unfinished , till we gave it To Baccio Bigio .</p>
     <p>JULIUS . Always Baccio Bigio ! Is there no other architect on earth ? Was it not he that sometime had in charge The harbor of Ancona .</p>
     <p>CARDINAL MARCELLO . Ay , the same .</p>
     <p>JULIUS . Then let me tell you that your Baccio Bigio Did greater damage in a single day To that fair harbor than the sea had done Or would do in ten years . And him you think To put in place of Michael Angelo , In building the Basilica of St. Peter ! The ass that thinks himself a stag discovers His error when he comes to leap the ditch .</p>
     <p>CARDINAL MARCELLO . He does not build ; he but demolishes The labors of Bramante and San Gallo .</p>
     <p>JULIUS . Only to build more grandly .</p>
     <p>CARDINAL MARCELLO . But time passes : Year after year goes by , and yet the work Is not completed . Michael Angelo Is a great sculptor , but no architect . His plans are faulty .</p>
     <p>JULIUS . I have seen his model , And have approved it . But here comes the artist . Beware of him . He may make Persians of you , To carry burdens on your backs forever .</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>SCENE II .</head>
       <l n="1">The same : MICHAEL ANGELO .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>JULIUS . Come forward , dear Maestro ! In these gardens All ceremonies of our court are banished . Sit down beside me here .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">MICHAEL ANGELO , sitting down .</l>
       <l n="2">How graciously</l>
       <l n="3">Your Holiness commiserates old age</l>
       <l n="4">And its infirmities !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>JULIUS . Say its privileges . Art I respect . The building of this palace And laying out these pleasant garden walks Are my delight , and if I have not asked Your aid in this , it is that I forbear To lay new burdens on you at an age When you need rest . Here I escape from Rome To be at peace . The tumult of the city Scarce reaches here .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . How beautiful it is , And quiet almost as a hermitage !</p>
     <p>JULIUS . We live as hermits here ; and from these heights O'erlook all Rome and see the yellow Tiber Cleaving in twain the city , like a sword , As far below there as St. Mary 's bridge . What think you of that bridge ?</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . I would advise Your Holiness not to cross it , or not often It is not safe .</p>
     <p>JULIUS . It was repaired of late .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Some morning you will look for it in vain ; It will be gone . The current of the river Is undermining it .</p>
     <p>JULIUS . But you repaired it .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . I strengthened all its piers , and paved its road With travertine . He who came after me Removed the stone , and sold it , and filled in The space with gravel .</p>
     <p>JULIUS . Cardinal Salviati And Cardinal Marcello , do you listen ? This is your famous Nanni Baccio Bigio .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">MICHAEL ANGELO , aside .</l>
       <l n="2">There is some mystery here . These Cardinals</l>
       <l n="3">Stand lowering at me with unfriendly eyes .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>JULIUS . Now let us come to what concerns us more Than bridge or gardens . Some complaints are made Concerning the Three Chapels in St. Peter 's ; Certain supposed defects or imperfections , You doubtless can explain .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . This is no longer The golden age of art . Men have become Iconoclasts and critics . They delight not In what an artist does , but set themselves To censure what they do not comprehend . You will not see them bearing a Madonna Of Cimabue to the church in triumph , But tearing down the statue of a Pope To cast it into cannon . Who are they That bring complaints against me ?</p>
     <p>JULIUS . Deputies Of the commissioners ; and they complain Of insufficient light in the Three Chapels .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Your Holiness , the insufficient light Is somewhere else , and not in the Three Chapels . Who are the deputies that make complaint ?</p>
     <p>JULIUS . The Cardinals Salviati and Marcello , Here present .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">MICHAEL ANGELO , rising .</l>
       <l n="2">With permission , Monsignori ,</l>
       <l n="3">What is it ye complain of ?</l>
     </lg>
     <p>CARDINAL MARCELLO , We regret You have departed from Bramante 's plan , And from San Gallo 's .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Since the ancient time No greater architect has lived on earth Than Lazzari Bramante . His design , Without confusion , simple , clear , well-lighted . Merits all praise , and to depart from it Would be departing from the truth . San Gallo , Building about with columns , took all light Out of this plan ; left in the choir dark corners For infinite ribaldries , and lurking places For rogues and robbers ; so that when the church Was shut at night , not five and twenty men Could find them out . It was San Gallo , then , That left the church in darkness , and not I .</p>
     <p>CARDINAL MARCELLO . Excuse me ; but in each of the Three Chapels Is but a single window .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Monsignore , Perhaps you do not know that in the vaulting Above there are to go three other windows .</p>
     <p>CARDINAL SALVIATI . How should we know ? You never told us of it .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . I neither am obliged , nor will I be , To tell your Eminence or any other What I intend or ought to do . Your office Is to provide the means , and see that thieves Do not lay hands upon them . The designs Must all be left to me .</p>
     <p>CARDINAL MARCELLO . Sir architect , You do forget yourself , to speak thus rudely In presence of his Holiness , and to us Who are his cardinals .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">MICHAEL ANGELO , putting on his hat .</l>
       <l n="2">I do not forget</l>
       <l n="3">I am descended from the Counts Canossa ,</l>
       <l n="4">Linked with the Imperial line , and with Matilda ,</l>
       <l n="5">Who gave the Church Saint Peter 's Patrimony .</l>
       <l n="6">I , too , am proud to give unto the Church</l>
       <l n="7">The labor of these hands , and what of life</l>
       <l n="8">Remains to me . My father Buonarotti</l>
       <l n="9">Was Podesta of Chiusi and Caprese .</l>
       <l n="10">I am not used to have men speak to me</l>
       <l n="11">As if I were a mason , hired to build</l>
       <l n="12">A garden wall , and paid on Saturdays</l>
       <l n="13">So much an hour .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="14">CARDINAL SALVIATI , aside .</l>
       <l n="15">No wonder that Pope Clement</l>
       <l n="16">Never sat down in presence of this man ,</l>
       <l n="17">Lest he should do the same ; and always bade him</l>
       <l n="18">Put on his hat , lest he unasked should do it !</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . If any one could die of grief and shame , I should . This labor was imposed upon me ; I did not seek it ; and if I assumed it , ‘ T was not for love of fame or love of gain , But for the love of God . Perhaps old age Deceived me , or self-interest , or ambition ; I may be doing harm instead of good . Therefore , I pray your Holiness , release me ; Take off from me the burden of this work ; Let me go back to Florence .</p>
     <p>JULIUS . Never , never , While I am living .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Doth your Holiness Remember what the Holy Scriptures say Of the inevitable time , when those Who look out of the windows shall be darkened , And the almond-tree shall flourish ?</p>
     <p>JULIUS . That is in Ecclesiastes .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . And the grasshopper Shall be a burden , and desire shall fail , Because man goeth unto his long home . Vanity of vanities , saith the Preacher ; all Is vanity .</p>
     <p>JULIUS . Ah , were to do a thing As easy as to dream of doing it , We should not want for artists . But the men Who carry out in act their great designs Are few in number ; ay , they may be counted Upon the fingers of this hand . Your place Is at St. Peter 's .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . I have had my dream , And cannot carry out my great conception , And put it into act .</p>
     <p>JULIUS . Then who can do it ? You would but leave it to some Baccio Bigio To mangle and deface .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Rather than that I will still bear the burden on my shoulders A little longer . If your Holiness Will keep the world in order , and will leave The building of the church to me , the work Will go on better for it . Holy Father , If all the labors that I have endured , And shall endure , advantage not my soul , I am but losing time .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">JULIUS , laying his hands on MICHAEL ANGELO 'S shoulders .</l>
       <l n="2">You will be gainer</l>
       <l n="3">Both for your soul and body .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Not events Exasperate me , but the funest conclusions I draw from these events ; the sure decline Of art , and all the meaning of that word : All that embellishes and sweetens life , And lifts it from the level of low cares Into the purer atmosphere of beauty ; The faith in the Ideal ; the inspiration That made the canons of the church of Seville Say , “ Let us build , so that all men hereafter Will say that we were madmen . ” Holy Father , I beg permission to retire from here .</p>
     <p>JULIUS . Go ; and my benediction be upon you .</p>
     <p>[ Michael Angelo goes out .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">My Cardinals , this Michael Angelo</l>
       <l n="2">Must not be dealt with as a common mason .</l>
       <l n="3">He comes of noble blood , and for his crest</l>
       <l n="4">Bear two bull 's horns ; and he has given us proof</l>
       <l n="5">That he can toss with them . From this day forth</l>
       <l n="6">Unto the end of time , let no man utter</l>
       <l n="7">The name of Baccio Bigio in my presence .</l>
       <l n="8">All great achievements are the natural fruits</l>
       <l n="9">Of a great character . As trees bear not</l>
       <l n="10">Their fruits of the same size and quality ,</l>
       <l n="11">But each one in its kind with equal ease ,</l>
       <l n="12">So are great deeds as natural to great men</l>
       <l n="13">As mean things are to small ones . By his work</l>
       <l n="14">We know the master . Let us not perplex him .</l>

       <l n="8">BINDO .</l>
       <l n="9">What brings you forth so early ?</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . The same reason That keeps you standing sentinel at your door ,— The air of this delicious summer morning . What news have you from Florence ?</p>
     <p>BINDO . Nothing new ; The same old tale of violence and wrong . Since the disastrous day at Monte Murlo , When in procession , through San Gallo 's gate , Bareheaded , clothed in rags , on sorry steeds , Philippo Strozzi and the good Valori Were led as prisoners down the streets of Florence , Amid the shouts of an ungrateful people , Hope is no more , and liberty no more . Duke Cosimo , the tyrant , reigns supreme .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Florence is dead : her houses are but tombs ; Silence and solitude are in her streets .</p>
     <p>BINDO . Ah yes ; and often I repeat the words You wrote upon your statue of the Night , There in the Sacristy of San Lorenzo : “ Grateful to me is sleep ; to be of stone More grateful , while the wrong and shame endure ; To see not , feel not , is a benediction ; Therefore awake me not ; oh , speak in whispers . ”</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Ah , Messer Bindo , the calamities , The fallen fortunes , and the desolation Of Florence are to me a tragedy Deeper than words , and darker than despair . I , who have worshipped freedom from my cradle , Have loved her with the passion of a lover , And clothed her with all lovely attributes That the imagination can conceive , Or the heart conjure up , now see her dead , And trodden in the dust beneath the feet Of an adventurer ! It is a grief Too great for me to bear in my old age .</p>
     <p>BINDO . I say no news from Florence : I am wrong , For Benvenuto writes that he is coming To be my guest in Rome .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Those are good tidings . He hath been many years away from us .</p>
     <p>BINDO . Pray you , come in .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . I have not time to stay , And yet I will . I see from here your house Is filled with works of art . That bust in bronze Is of yourself . Tell me , who is the master That works in such an admirable way , And with such power and feeling ?</p>
     <p>BINDO . Benvenuto .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Ah ? Benvenuto ? ‘ T is a masterpiece ! It pleases me as much , and even more , Than the antiques about it ; and yet they Are of the best one sees . But you have placed it By far too high . The light comes from below , And injures the expression . Were these windows Above and not beneath it , then indeed It would maintain its own among these works Of the old masters , noble as they are . I will go in and study it more closely . I always prophesied that Benvenuto , With all his follies and fantastic ways , Would show his genius in some work of art That would amaze the world , and be a challenge Unto all other artists of his time .</p>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">CAVALIERI .</l>
       <l n="3">What have you here alone , Messer Michele ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="4">MICHAEL ANGELO .</l>
       <l n="5">I come to learn .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>CAVALIERI . You are already master , And teach all other men .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Nay , I know nothing ; Not even my own ignorance , as some Philosopher hath said . I am a schoolboy Who hath not learned his lesson , and who stands Ashamed and silent in the awful presence Of the great master of antiquity Who built these walls cyclopean .</p>
     <p>CAVALIERI . Gaudentius His name was , I remember . His reward Was to be thrown alive to the wild beasts Here where we now are standing .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Idle tales .</p>
     <p>CAVALIERI . But you are greater than Gaudentius was , And your work nobler .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Silence , I beseech you .</p>
     <p>CAVALIERI . Tradition says that fifteen thousand men Were toiling for ten years incessantly Upon this amphitheatre .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Behold How wonderful it is ! The queen of flowers , The marble rose of Rome ! Its petals torn By wind and rain of thrice five hundred years ; Its mossy sheath half rent away , and sold To ornament our palaces and churches , Or to be trodden under feet of man Upon the Tiber 's bank ; yet what remains Still opening its fair bosom to the sun , And to the constellations that at night Hang poised above it like a swarm of bees .</p>
     <p>CAVALIERI . The rose of Rome , but not of Paradise ; Not the white rose our Tuscan poet saw , With saints for petals . When this rose was perfect Its hundred thousand petals were not Saints , But senators in their Thessalian caps , And all the roaring populace of Rome ; And even an Empress and the Vestal Virgins , Who came to see the gladiators die , Could not give sweetness to a rose like this .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . I spake not of its uses , but its beauty .</p>
     <p>CAVALIERI . The sand beneath our feet is saturate With blood of martyrs ; and these rifted stones Are awful witnesses against a people Whose pleasure was the pain of dying men .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Tomaso Cavalieri , on my word , You should have been a preacher , not a painter ! Think you that I approve such cruelties , Because I marvel at the architects Who built these walls , and curved these noble arches ? Oh , I am put to shame , when I consider How mean our work is , when compared with theirs ! Look at these walls about us and above us ! They have been shaken by earthquake ; have been made A fortress , and been battered by long sieges ; The iron clamps , that held the stones together , Have been wrenched from them ; but they stand erect And firm , as if they had been hewn and hollowed Out of the solid rock , and were a part Of the foundations of the world itself .</p>
     <p>CAVALIERI . Your work , I say again , is nobler work , In so far as its end and aim are nobler ; And this is but a ruin , like the rest . Its vaulted passages are made the caverns Of robbers , and are haunted by the ghosts Of murdered men .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . A thousand wild flowers bloom From every chink , and the birds build their nests Among the ruined arches , and suggest New thoughts of beauty to the architect , Now let us climb the broken stairs that lead Into the corridors above , and study The marvel and the mystery of that art In which I am a pupil , not a master . All things must have an end ; the world itself Must have an end , as in a dream I saw it . There came a great hand out of heaven , and touched The earth , and stopped it in its course . The seas Leaped , a vast cataract , into the abyss ; The forests and the fields slid off , and floated Like wooded islands in the air . The dead Were hurled forth from their sepulchres ; the living Were mingled with them , and themselves were dead ,— All being dead ; and the fair , shining cities Dropped out like jewels from a broken crown . Naught but the core of the great globe remained , A skeleton of stone . And over it The wrack of matter drifted like a cloud , And then recoiled upon itself , and fell Back on the empty world , that with the weight Reeled , staggered , righted , and then headlong plunged Into the darkness , as a ship , when struck By a great sea , throws off the waves at first On either side , then settles and goes down Into the dark abyss , with her dead crew .</p>
     <p>CAVALIERI . But the earth does not move .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Who knows ? who knowst ? There are great truths that pitch their shining tents Outside our walls , and though but dimly seen In the gray dawn , they will be manifest When the light widens into perfect day . A certain man , Copernicus by name , Sometime professor here in Rome , has whispered It is the earth , and not the sun , that moves . What I beheld was only in a dream , Yet dreams sometimes anticipate events , Being unsubstantial images of things As yet unseen .</p>
     <p>V</p>
     <p>MACELLO DE ’ CORVI</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO , BENVENUTO CELLINI .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . So , Benvenuto , you return once more To the Eternal City . ‘ T is the centre To which all gravitates . One finds no rest Elsewhere than here . There may be other cities That please us for a while , but Rome alone Completely satisfies . It becomes to all A second native land by predilection , And not by accident of birth alone .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . I am but just arrived , and am now lodging With Bindo Altoviti . I have been To kiss the feet of our most Holy Father , And now am come in haste to kiss the hands Of my miraculous Master .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . And to find him Grown very old .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . You know that precious stones Never grow old .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Half sunk beneath the horizon , And yet not gone . Twelve years are a long while . Tell me of France .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . It were too long a tale To tell you all . Suffice in brief to say The King received me well , and loved me well ; Gave me the annual pension that before me Our Leonardo had , nor more nor less , And for my residence the Tour de Nesle , Upon the river-side .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . A princely lodging .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . What in return I did now matters not , For there are other things , of greater moment , I wish to speak of . First of all , the letter You wrote me , not long since , about my bust Of Bindo Altoviti , here in Rome . You said , “ My Benvenuto , I for many years Have known you as the greatest of all goldsmiths , And now I know you as no less a sculptor . ” Ah , generous Master ! How shall I e'er thank you For such kind language ?</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . By believing it . I saw the bust at Messer Bindo 's house , And thought it worthy of the ancient masters , And said so . That is all .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . It is too much ; And I should stand abashed here in your presence , Had I done nothing worthier of your praise Than Bindo 's bust .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . What have you done that 's better ?</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . When I left Rome for Paris , you remember I promised you that if I went a goldsmith I would return a sculptor . I have kept The promise I then made .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Dear Benvenuto , I recognized the latent genius in you , But feared your vices .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . I have turned them all To virtues . My impatient , wayward nature , That made me quick in quarrel , now has served me Where meekness could not , and where patience could not , As you shall hear now . I have cast in bronze A statue of Perseus , holding thus aloft In his left hand the head of the Medusa , And in his right the sword that severed it ; His right foot planted on the lifeless corse ; His face superb and pitiful , with eyes Down-looking on the victim of his vengeance .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . I see it as it should be .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . As it will be When it is placed upon the Ducal Square , Half-way between your David and the Judith Of Donatello .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Rival of them both !</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . But ah , what infinite trouble have I had With Bandinello , and that stupid beast , The major-domo of Duke Cosimo , Francesco Ricci , and their wretched agent Gorini , who came crawling round about me Like a black spider , with his whining voice That sounded like the buzz of a mosquito ! Oh , I have wept in utter desperation , And wished a thousand times I had not left My Tour do Nesle , nor e'er returned to Florence , Or thought of Perseus . What malignant falsehoods They told the Grand Duke , to impede my work , And make me desperate !</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . The nimble lie Is like the second-hand upon a clock ; We see it fly ; while the hour-hand of truth Seems to stand still , and yet it moves unseen , And wins at last , for the clock will not strike Till it has reached the goal .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . My obstinacy Stood me in stead , and helped me to o'ercome The hindrances that envy and ill-will Put in my way .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . When anything is done People see not the patient doing of it , Nor think how great would be the loss to man If it had not been done . As in a building Stone rests on stone , and wanting the foundation All would be wanting , so in human life Each action rests on the foregone event , That made it possible , but is forgotten And buried in the earth .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . Even Bandinello , Who never yet spake well of anything , Speaks well of this ; and yet he told the Duke That , though I cast small figures well enough , I never could cast this .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . But you have done it , And proved Ser Bandinello a false prophet . That is the wisest way .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . And ah , that casting What a wild scene it was , as late at night , A night of wind and rain , we heaped the furnace With pine of Serristori , till the flames Caught in the rafters over us , and threatened To send the burning roof upon our heads ; And from the garden side the wind and rain Poured in upon us , and half quenched our fires . I was beside myself with desperation . A shudder came upon me , then a fever ; I thought that I was dying , and was forced To leave the work-shop , and to throw myself Upon my bed , as one who has no hope . And as I lay there , a deformed old man Appeared before me , and with dismal voice , Like one who doth exhort a criminal Led forth to death , exclaimed , “ Poor Benvenuto , Thy work is spoiled ! There is no remedy ! ” Then , with a cry so loud it might have reached The heaven of fire , I bounded to my feet , And rushed back to my workmen . They all stood Bewildered and desponding ; and I looked Into the furnace , and beheld the mass Half molten only , and in my despair I fed the fire with oak , whose terrible heat Soon made the sluggish metal shine and sparkle . Then followed a bright flash , and an explosion , As if a thunderbolt had fallen among us . The covering of the furnace had been rent Asunder , and the bronze was flowing over ; So that I straightway opened all the sluices To fill the mould . The metal ran like lava , Sluggish and heavy ; and I sent my workmen To ransack the whole house , and bring together My pewter plates and pans , two hundred of them , And cast them one by one into the furnace To liquefy the mass , and in a moment The mould was filled ! I fell upon my knees And thanked the Lord ; and then we ate and drank And went to bed , all hearty and contented . It was two hours before the break of day . My fever was quite gone .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . A strange adventure , That could have happened to no man alive But you , my Benvenuto .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . As my workmen said To major-domo Ricci afterward , When he inquired of them : “ ‘ T was not a man , But an express great devil . ”</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . And the statue ?</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . Perfect in every part , save the right foot Of Perseus , as I had foretold the Duke . There was just bronze enough to fill the mould ; Not a drop over , not a drop too little . I looked upon it as a miracle Wrought by the hand of God .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . And now I see How you have turned your vices into virtues .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . But wherefore do I prate of this ? I came To speak of other things . Duke Cosimo Through me invites you to return to Florence , And offers you great honors , even to make you One of the Forty-Eight , his Senators .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . His Senators ! That is enough . Since Florence Was changed by Clement Seventh from a Republic Into a Dukedom , I no longer wish To be a Florentine . That dream is ended . The Grand Duke Cosimo now reigns supreme ; All liberty is dead . Ah , woe is me ! I hoped to see my country rise to heights Of happiness and freedom yet unreached By other nations , but the climbing wave Pauses , lets go its hold , and slides again Back to the common level , with a hoarse Death rattle in its throat . I am too old To hope for better days . I will stay here And die in Rome . The very weeds , that grow Among the broken fragments of her ruins , Are sweeter to me than the garden flowers Of other cities ; and the desolate ring Of the Campagna round about her walls Fairer than all the villas that encircle The towns of Tuscany .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . But your old friends !</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . All dead by violence . Baccio Valori Has been beheaded ; Guicciardini poisoned ; Philippo Strozzi strangled in his prison . Is Florence then a place for honest men To flourish in ? What is there to prevent My sharing the same fate ?</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . Why this : if all Your friends are dead , so are your enemies .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Is Aretino dead ?</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . He lives in Venice , And not in Florence .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . ‘ T is the same to me This wretched mountebank , whom flatterers Call the Divine , as if to make the word Unpleasant in the mouths of those who speak it And in the ears of those who hear it , sends me A letter written for the public eye , And with such subtle and infernal malice , I wonder at his wickedness . ‘ T is he Is the express great devil , and not you . Some years ago he told me how to paint The scenes of the Last Judgment .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . I remember .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Well , now he writes to me that , as a Christian , He is ashamed of the unbounded freedom With which I represent it .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . Hypocrite !</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . He says I show mankind that I am wanting In piety and religion , in proportion As I profess perfection in my art . Profess perfection ? Why , ‘ t is only men Like Bugiardini who are satisfied With what they do . I never am content , But always see the labors of my hand Fall short of my conception .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . I perceive The malice of this creature . He would taint you With heresy , and in a time like this ! ‘ T is infamous !</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . I represent the angels Without their heavenly glory , and the saints Without a trace of earthly modesty .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . Incredible audacity !</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . The heathen Veiled their Diana with some drapery , And when they represented Venus naked They made her by her modest attitude , Appear half clothed . But I , who am a Christian , Do so subordinate belief to art That I have made the very violation Of modesty in martyrs and in virgins A spectacle at which all men would gaze With half-averted eyes even in a brothel .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . He is at home there , and he ought to know What men avert their eyes from in such places ; From the Last Judgment chiefly , I imagine .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . But divine Providence will never leave The boldness of my marvellous work unpunished ; And the more marvellous it is , the more ‘ T is sure to prove the ruin of my fame ! And finally , if in this composition I had pursued the instructions that he gave me Concerning heaven and hell and paradise , In that same letter , known to all the world , Nature would not be forced , as she is now , To feel ashamed that she invested me With such great talent ; that I stand myself A very idol in the world of art . He taunts me also with the Mausoleum Of Julius , still unfinished , for the reason That men persuaded the inane old man It was of evil augury to build His tomb while he was living ; and he speaks Of heaps of gold this Pope bequeathed to me , And calls it robbery ;— that is what he says . What prompted such a letter ?</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . Vanity . He is a clever writer , and he likes To draw his pen , and flourish it in the face Of every honest man , as swordsmen do Their rapiers on occasion , but to show How skilfully they do it . Had you followed The advice he gave , or even thanked him for it , You would have seen another style of fence . ‘ T is but his wounded vanity , and the wish To see his name in print . So give it not A moment 's thought ; it soon will be forgotten .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . I will not think of it , but let it pass For a rude speech thrown at me in the street , As boys threw stones at Dante .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . And what answer Shall I take back to Grand Duke Cosimo ? He does not ask your labor or your service ; Only your presence in the city of Florence , With such advice upon his work in hand As he may ask , and you may choose to give .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . You have my answer . Nothing he can offer Shall tempt me to leave Rome . My work is here , And only here , the building of St. Peter 's . What other things I hitherto have done Have fallen from me , are no longer mine ; I have passed on beyond them , and have left them As milestones on the way . What lies before me , That is still mine , and while it is unfinished No one shall draw me from it , or persuade me , By promises of ease , or wealth , or honor , Till I behold the finished dome uprise Complete , as now I see it in my thought .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . And will you paint no more ?</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . No more .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . ‘ T is well . Sculpture is more divine , and more like Nature , That fashions all her works in high relief , And that is sculpture . This vast ball , the Earth , Was moulded out of clay , and baked in fire ; Men , women , and all animals that breathe Are statues , and not paintings . Even the plants , The flowers , the fruits , the grasses , were first sculptured , And colored later . Painting is a lie , A shadow merely .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Truly , as you say , Sculpture is more than painting . It is greater To raise the dead to life than to create Phantoms that seem to live . The most majestic Of the three sister arts is that which builds ; The eldest of them all , to whom the others Are but the hand-maids and the servitors , Being but imitation , not creation . Henceforth I dedicate myself to her .</p>
     <p>BENVENUTO . And no more from the marble hew those forms That fill us all with wonder ?</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Many statues Will there be room for in my work . Their station Already is assigned them in my mind . But things move slowly . There are hindrances , Want of material , want of means , delays And interruptions , endless interference Of Cardinal Commissioners , and disputes And jealousies of artists , that annoy me . But twill persevere until the work Is wholly finished , or till I sink down Surprised by death , that unexpected guest , Who waits for no man 's leisure , but steps in , Unasked and unannounced , to put a stop To all our occupations and designs . And then perhaps I may go back to Florence ; This is my answer to Duke Cosimo .</p>

       <l n="4">My strength begins to fail me .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>URBINO . Eccellenza . That is impossible . Do I not see you Attack the marble blocks with the same fury As twenty years ago ?</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . ‘ T is an old habit . I must have learned it early from my nurse At Setignano , the stone-mason 's wife ; For the first sounds I heard were of the chisel chipping away the stone .</p>
     <p>URBINO . At every stroke You strike fire with your chisel .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Ay , because The marble is too hard .</p>
     <p>URBINO . It is a block That Topolino sent you from Carrara . He is a judge of marble .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . I remember . With it he sent me something of his making ,— A Mercury , with long body and short legs , As if by any possibility A messenger of the gods could have short legs . It was no more like Mercury than you are , But rather like those little plaster figures That peddlers hawk about the villages As images of saints . But luckily For Topolino , there are many people Who see no difference between what is best And what is only good , or not even good ; So that poor artists stand in their esteem On the same level with the best , or higher .</p>
     <p>URBINO . How Eccellenza laughed !</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Poor Topolino ! All men are not born artists , nor will labor E'er make them artists .</p>
     <p>URBINO . No , no more Than Emperors , or Popes , or Cardinals . One must be chosen for it . I have been Your color-grinder six and twenty years , And am not yet an artist .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Some have eyes That see not ; but in every block of marble I see a statue ,— see it as distinctly As if it stood before me shaped and perfect In attitude and action . I have only To hew away the stone walls that imprison The lovely apparition , and reveal it To other eyes as mine already see it . But I grow old and weak . What wilt thou do When I am dead , Urbino ?</p>
     <p>URBINO . Eccellenza , I must then serve another master .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Never ! Bitter is servitude at best . Already So many years hast thou been serving me ; But rather as a friend than as a servant . We have grown old together . Dost thou think So meanly of this Michael Angelo As to imagine he would let thee serve , When he is free from service ? Take this purse , Two thousand crowns in gold .</p>
     <p>URBINO . Two thousand crowns !</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Ay , it will make thee rich . Thou shalt not die A beggar in a hospital .</p>
     <p>URBINO . Oh , Master !</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . I cannot have them with me on the journey That I am undertaking . The last garment That men will make for me will have no pockets .</p>

      <head>THE OAKS OF MONTE LUCA</head>
       <l n="1">MICHAEL ANGELO , alone in the woods .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . How still it is among these ancient oaks ! Surges and undulations of the air Uplift the leafy boughs , and let them fall With scarce a sound . Such sylvan quietudes Become old age . These huge centennial oaks , That may have heard in infancy the trumpets Of Barbarossa 's cavalry , deride Man 's brief existence , that with all his strength He cannot stretch beyond the hundredth year . This little acorn , turbaned like the Turk , Which with my foot I spurn , may be an oak Hereafter , feeding with its bitter mast The fierce wild boar , and tossing in its arms The cradled nests of birds , when all the men That now inhabit this vast universe , They and their children , and their children 's children , Shall be but dust and mould , and nothing more . Through openings in the trees I see below me The valley of Clitumnus , with its farms And snow-white oxen grazing in the shade Of the tall poplars on the river 's brink . O Nature , gentle mother , tender nurse ! I who have never loved thee as I ought , But wasted all my years immured in cities , And breathed the stifling atmosphere of streets , Now come to thee for refuge . Here is peace . Yonder I see the little hermitages Dotting the mountain side with points of light , And here St. Julian 's convent , like a nest Of curlews , clinging to some windy cliff . Beyond the broad , illimitable plain Down sinks the sun , red as Apollo 's quoit , That , by the envious Zephyr blown aside , Struck Hyacinthus dead , and stained the earth With his young blood , that blossomed into flowers . And now , instead of these fair deities Dread demons haunt the earth ; hermits inhabit The leafy homes of sylvan Hamadryads ; And jovial friars , rotund and rubicund , Replace the old Silenus with his ass .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Here underneath these venerable oaks ,</l>
       <l n="2">Wrinkled and brown and gnarled like them with age ,</l>
       <l n="3">A brother of the monastery sits ,</l>
       <l n="4">Lost in his meditations . What may be</l>
       <l n="5">The questions that perplex , the hopes that cheer him ?</l>
       <l n="6">Good-evening , holy father .</l>

       <l n="8">God be with you .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Pardon a stranger if he interrupt Your meditations .</p>
     <p>MONK . It was but a dream ,— The old , old dream , that never will come true ; The dream that all my life I have been dreaming , And yet is still a dream .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . All men have dreams : I have had mine ; but none of them came true ; They were but vanity . Sometimes I think The happiness of man lies in pursuing , Not in possessing ; for the things possessed Lose half their value . Tell me of your dream .</p>
     <p>MONK . The yearning of my heart , my sole desire , That like the sheaf of Joseph stands up right , While all the others bend and bow to it ; The passion that torments me , and that breathes New meaning into the dead forms of prayer , Is that with mortal eyes I may behold The Eternal City .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Rome ?</p>
     <p>MONK . There is but one ; The rest are merely names . I think of it As the Celestial City , paved with gold , And sentinelled with angels .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Would it were . I have just fled from it . It is beleaguered By Spanish troops , led by the Duke of Alva .</p>
     <p>MONK . But still for me ‘ t is the Celestial City , And I would see it once before I die .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Each one must bear his cross .</p>
     <p>MONK . Were it a cross That had been laid upon me , I could bear it , Or fall with it . It is a crucifix ; I am nailed hand and foot , and I am dying !</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . What would you see in Rome ?</p>
     <p>MONK . His Holiness .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Him that was once the Cardinal Caraffa ? You would but see a man of fourscore years , With sunken eyes , burning like carbuncles , Who sits at table with his friends for hours , Cursing the Spaniards as a race of Jews And miscreant Moors . And with what soldiery Think you he now defends the Eternal City ?</p>
     <p>MONK . With legions of bright angels .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . So he calls them ; And yet in fact these bright angelic legions Are only German Lutherans .</p>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>MONK . The Cardinals , Going in their gilt coaches to High Mass .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . Men do not go to Paradise in coaches .</p>
     <p>MONK . The catacombs , the convents , and the churches ; The ceremonies of the Holy Week In all their pomp , or , at the Epiphany , The Feast of the Santissima Bambino At Ara Coeli . But I shall not see them .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . These pompous ceremonies of the Church Are but an empty show to him who knows The actors in them . Stay here in your convent , For he who goes to Rome may see too much . What would you further ?</p>
     <p>MONK . I would see the painting of the Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . The smoke of incense and of altar candles Has blackened it already .</p>
     <p>MONK . Woe is me ! Then I would hear Allegri 's Miserere , Sung by the Papal choir .</p>
     <p>MICHAEL ANGELO . A dismal dirge ! I am an old , old man , and I have lived In Rome for thirty years and more , and know The jarring of the wheels of that great world , Its jealousies , its discords , and its strife . Therefore I say to you , remain content Here in your convent , here among your woods , Where only there is peace . Go not to Rome . There was of old a monk of Wittenberg Who went to Rome ; you may have heard of him ; His name was Luther ; and you know what followed .</p>
     <p>[ The convent bell rings .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">MONK , rising .</l>
       <l n="2">It is the convent bell ; it rings for vespers .</l>

       <l n="1">Lord , what am I , that with unceasing care ,</l>
       <l n="2">Thou didst seek after me , that thou didst wait</l>
       <l n="3">Wet with unhealthy dews , before my gate ,</l>
       <l n="4">And pass the gloomy nights of winter there ?</l>
       <l n="5">O strange delusion ! that I did not greet</l>
       <l n="6">Thy blest approach , and O , to Heaven how lost ,</l>
       <l n="7">If my ingratitude 's unkindly frost</l>
       <l n="8">Has chilled the bleeding wounds upon thy feet .</l>
       <l n="9">How oft my guardian angel gently cried ,</l>
       <l n="10">“ Soul , from thy casement look , and thou shalt see</l>
       <l n="11">How he persists to knock and wait for thee ! ”</l>
       <l n="12">And , O ! how often to that voice of sorrow ,</l>
       <l n="13">“ To-morrow we will open , ” I replied ,</l>
       <l n="14">And when the morrow came I answered still “ To-morrow . ”</l>

       <head>I</head>
      <head>FRITHIOF 'S HOMESTEAD</head>
       <l n="1">Three miles extended around the fields of the homestead , on three sides</l>
       <l n="2">Valleys and mountains and hills , but on the fourth side was the ocean .</l>
       <l n="3">Birch woods crowned the summits , but down the slope of the hillsides</l>
       <l n="4">Flourished the golden corn , and man-high was waving the rye-field .</l>
       <l n="5">Lakes , full many in number , their mirror held up for the mountains ,</l>
       <l n="6">Held for the forests up , in whose depths the high-horned reindeers</l>
       <l n="7">Had their kingly walk , and drank of a hundred brooklets .</l>
       <l n="8">But in the valleys widely around , there fed on the greensward</l>
       <l n="9">Herds with shining hides and udders that longed for the milk-pail .</l>
       <l n="10">‘ Mid these scattered , now here and now there , were numberless flocks of</l>
       <l n="11">Sheep with fleeces white , as thou seest the white-looking stray clouds ,</l>
       <l n="12">Flock-wise spread o'er the heavenly vault when it bloweth in springtime .</l>
       <l n="13">Coursers two times twelve , all mettlesome , fast fettered storm-winds ,</l>
       <l n="14">Stamping stood in the line of stalls , and tugged at their fodder .</l>
       <l n="15">Knotted with red were their manes , and their hoofs all white with steel shoes .</l>
       <l n="16">Th ’ banquet-hall , a house by itself , was timbered of hard fir .</l>
       <l n="17">Not five hundred men ( at ten times twelve to the hundred )</l>
       <l n="18">Filled up the roomy hall , when assembled for drinking , at Yule-tide .</l>
       <l n="19">Through the hall , as long as it was , went a table of holm-oak ,</l>
       <l n="20">Polished and white , as of steel ; the columns twain of the High-seat</l>
       <l n="21">Stood at the end thereof , two gods carved out of an elm-tree :</l>
       <l n="22">Odin with lordly look , and Frey with the sun on his frontlet .</l>
       <l n="23">Lately between the two , on a bear-skin ( the skin it was coal-black ,</l>
       <l n="24">Scarlet-red was the throat , but the paws were shodden with silver ) ,</l>
       <l n="25">Thorsten sat with his friends , Hospitality sitting with Gladness .</l>
       <l n="26">Oft , when the moon through the cloudrack flew , related the old man</l>
       <l n="27">Wonders from distant lands he had seen , and cruises of Vikings</l>
       <l n="28">Far away on the Baltic , and Sea of the West and the White Sea .</l>
       <l n="29">Hushed sat the listening bench , and their glances hung on the graybeard 's</l>
       <l n="30">Lips , as a bee on the rose ; but the Scald was thinking of Brage ,</l>
       <l n="31">Where , with his silver beard , and runes on his tongue , he is seated</l>
       <l n="32">Under the leafy beech , and tells a tradition by Mimer 's</l>
       <l n="33">Ever-murmuring wave , himself a living tradition .</l>
       <l n="34">Midway the floor ( with thatch was it strewn ) burned ever the fire-flame</l>
       <l n="35">Glad on its stone-built hearth ; and thorough the wide-mouthed smoke-flue</l>
       <l n="36">Looked the stars , those heavenly friends , down into the great hall .</l>
       <l n="37">Round the walls , upon nails of steel , were hanging in order</l>
       <l n="38">Breastplate and helmet together , and here and there among them</l>
       <l n="39">Downward lightened a sword , as in winter evening a star shoots .</l>
       <l n="40">More than helmets and swords the shields in the hall were resplendent ,</l>
       <l n="41">White as the orb of the sun , or white as the moon 's disk of silver .</l>
       <l n="42">Ever and anon went a maid round the hoard , and filled up the drink-horns ,</l>
       <l n="43">Ever she cast down her eyes and blushed ; in the shield her reflection</l>
       <l n="44">Blushed , too , even as she ; this gladdened the drinking champions .</l>

       <l n="1">Pentecost , day of rejoicing , had come . The church of the village</l>
       <l n="2">Gleaming stood in the morning 's sheen .</l>
       <l n="3">On the spire of the bell</l>
       <l n="4">Decked with a brazen cock , the friendly flames of the Spring-sun</l>
       <l n="5">Glanced like the tongues of fire , beheld by Apostles aforetime .</l>
       <l n="6">Clear was the heaven and blue , and May , with her cap crowned with roses ,</l>
       <l n="7">Stood in her holiday dress in the fields , and the wind and the brooklet</l>
       <l n="8">Murmured gladness and peace , God'shYpppHeNpeace ! with lips rosy-tinted</l>
       <l n="9">Whispered the race of the flowers , and merry on balancing branches</l>
       <l n="10">Birds were singing their carol , a jubilant hymn to the Highest .</l>
       <l n="11">Swept and clean was the churchyard . Adorned like a leaf-woven arbor</l>
       <l n="12">Stood its old-fashioned gate ; and within upon each cross of iron</l>
       <l n="13">Hung was a fragrant garland , new twined by the hands of affection .</l>
       <l n="14">Even the dial , that stood on a mound among the departed ,</l>
       <l n="15">( There full a hundred years had it stood ,) was embellished with blossoms</l>
       <l n="16">Like to the patriarch hoary , the sage of his kith and the hamlet ,</l>
       <l n="17">Who on his birthday is crowned by children and children 's children ,</l>
       <l n="18">So stood the ancient prophet , and mute with his pencil of iron</l>
       <l n="19">Marked on the tablet of stone , and measured the time and its changes ,</l>
       <l n="20">While all around at his feet , an eternity slumbered in quiet .</l>
       <l n="21">Also the church within was adorned , for this was the season</l>
       <l n="22">When the young , their parents ’ hope , and the loved-ones of heaven ,</l>
       <l n="23">Should at the foot of the altar renew the vows of their baptism .</l>

       <l n="27">Saw we in living presentment . From noble arms on the church wall</l>
       <l n="28">Grew forth a cluster of leaves , and the preacher 's pulpit of oak-wood</l>
       <l n="29">Budded once more anew , as aforetime the rod before Aaron .</l>
       <l n="30">Wreathed thereon was the Bible with leaves , and the dove , washed with silver</l>
       <l n="31">Under its canopy fastened , had on it a necklace of wind-flowers .</l>
       <l n="32">But in front of the choir , round the altar-piece painted by Horberg ,</l>
       <l n="33">Crept a garland gigantic ; and bright-curling tresses of angels</l>
       <l n="34">Peeped , like the sun from a cloud , from out of the shadowy leaf-work .</l>
       <l n="35">Likewise the lustre of brass , new-polished , blinked from the ceiling ,</l>
       <l n="36">And for lights there were lilies of Pentecost set in the sockets .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="37">Loud rang the bells already ; the thronging crowd was assembled</l>
       <l n="38">Far from valleys and hills , to list to the holy preaching .</l>
       <l n="39">Hark ! then roll forth at once the mighty tones of the organ ,</l>
       <l n="40">Hover like voices from God , aloft like invisible spirits .</l>
       <l n="41">Like as Elias in heaven , when he cast from off him his mantle ,</l>
       <l n="42">So cast off the soul its garments of earth ; and with one voice</l>
       <l n="43">Chimed in the congregation , and sang an anthem immortal</l>
       <l n="44">Of the sublime Wallin , of David 's harp in the North-land</l>
       <l n="45">Tuned to the choral of Luther ; the song on its mighty pinions</l>
       <l n="46">Took every living soul , and lifted it gently to heaven ,</l>
       <l n="47">And each face did shine like the Holy One 's face upon Tabor .</l>
       <l n="48">Lo ! there entered then into the church the Reverend Teacher .</l>
       <l n="49">Father he hight and he was in the parish ; a Christianly plainness</l>
       <l n="50">Clothed from his head to his feet the old man of seventy winters .</l>
       <l n="51">Friendly was he to behold , and glad as the heralding angel</l>
       <l n="52">Walked he among the crowds , but still a contemplative grandeur</l>
       <l n="53">Lay on his forehead as clear as on moss-covered gravestone a sunbeam .</l>
       <l n="54">As in his inspiration ( an evening twilight that faintly</l>
       <l n="55">Gleams in the human soul , even now , from the day of creation )</l>
       <l n="56">Th ’ Artist , the friend of heaven , imagines Saint John when in Patmos ,</l>
       <l n="57">Gray , with his eyes uplifted to heaven , so seemed then the old man :</l>
       <l n="58">Such was the glance of his eye , and such were his tresses of silver .</l>
       <l n="59">All the congregation arose in the pews that were numbered .</l>
       <l n="60">But with a cordial look , to the right and the left hand , the old man</l>
       <l n="61">Nodding all hail and peace , disappeared in the innermost chancel .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="62">Simply and solemnly now proceeded the Christian service ,</l>
       <l n="63">Singing and prayer , and at last an ardent discourse from the old man .</l>
       <l n="64">Many a moving word and warning , that out of the heart came ,</l>
       <l n="65">Fell like the dew of the morning , like manna on those in the desert .</l>
       <l n="66">Then , when all was finished , the Teacher re-entered the chancel</l>
       <l n="67">Followed therein by the young . The boys on the right had their places ,</l>
       <l n="68">Delicate figures , with close-curling hair and cheeks rosy-blooming .</l>
       <l n="69">But on the left of these there stood the tremulous lilies ,</l>
       <l n="70">Tinged with the blushing light of the dawn , the diffident maidens ,—</l>
       <l n="71">Folding their hands in prayer , and their eyes cast down on the pavement</l>
       <l n="72">Now came , with question and answer , the catechism . In the beginning</l>
       <l n="73">Answered the children with troubled and faltering voice , but the old man 's</l>
       <l n="74">Glances of kindness encouraged them soon , and the doctrines eternal</l>
       <l n="75">Flowed , like the waters of fountains , so clear from lips unpolluted .</l>
       <l n="76">Each time the answer was closed , and as oft as they named the Redeemer ,</l>
       <l n="77">Lowly louted the boys , and lowly the maidens all courtesied .</l>
       <l n="78">Friendly the Teacher stood , like an angel of light there among them .</l>
       <l n="79">And to the children explained the holy , the highest , in few words ,</l>
       <l n="80">Thorough , yet simple and clear , for sublimity always is simple ,</l>
       <l n="81">Both in sermon and song , a child can seize on its meaning .</l>
       <l n="82">E'en as the green-growing bud unfolds when Springtide approaches .</l>
       <l n="83">Leaf by leaf puts forth , and warmed , by the radiant sunshine ,</l>
       <l n="84">Blushes with purple and gold , till at last the perfected blossom</l>
       <l n="85">Opens its odorous chalice , and rocks with its crown in the breezes ,</l>
       <l n="86">So was unfolded here the Christian lore of salvation ,</l>
       <l n="87">Line by line from the soul of childhood . The fathers and mothers</l>
       <l n="88">Stood behind them in tears , and were glad at the well-worded answer .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="89">Now went the old man up to the altar ;— and straightway transfigured</l>
       <l n="90">( So did it seem unto me ) was then the affectionate Teacher .</l>
       <l n="91">Like the Lord 's Prophet sublime , and awful as Death and as Judgment</l>
       <l n="92">Stood he , the God-commissioned , the soul-searcher , earthward descending</l>
       <l n="93">Glances , sharp as a sword , into hearts that to him were transparent</l>
       <l n="94">Shot he ; his voice was deep , was low like the thunder afar off .</l>
       <l n="95">So on a sudden transfigured he stood there , lie spake and he questioned .</l>

       <l n="122">Answered the young men Yes ! and Yes ! with lips softly-breathing</l>
       <l n="123">Answered the maidens eke . Then dissolved from the brow of the Teacher</l>

       <l n="163">Shone a more beautiful sun , and he played with the winged angels .</l>
       <l n="164">Then grows the earth too narrow , too close ; and homesick for heaven</l>

       <l n="187">Yet ,— why are ye afraid , ye children ? This awful avenger ,</l>
       <l n="188">Ah ! is a merciful God ! God 's voice was not in the earthquake ,</l>
       <l n="189">Not in the fire , nor the storm , but it was in the whispering breezes .</l>
       <l n="190">Love is the root of creation ; God 's essence ; worlds without number</l>
       <l n="191">Lie in his bosom like children ; he made them for this purpose only .</l>
       <l n="192">Only to love and to be loved again , he breathed forth his spirit</l>
       <l n="193">Into the slumbering dust , and upright standing , it laid its</l>
       <l n="194">Hand on its heart , and felt it was warm with a flame out of heaven .</l>
       <l n="195">Quench , oh quench not that flame ! It is the breath of your being .</l>
       <l n="196">Love is life , but hatred is death . Not father , nor mother</l>
       <l n="197">Loved you , as God has loved you ; for ‘ t was that you may be happy</l>
       <l n="198">Gave he his only Son . When he bowed down his head in the death-hour</l>
       <l n="199">Solemnized Love its triumph ; the sacrifice then was completed .</l>
       <l n="200">Lo ! then was rent on a sudden the veil of the temple , dividing</l>
       <l n="201">Earth and heaven apart , and the dead from their sepulchres rising</l>

       <l n="203">Th ’ answer , but dreamed of before , to creation 's enigma ,— Atonement !</l>
       <l n="204">Depths of Love are Atonement 's depths , for Love is Atonement .</l>
       <l n="205">Therefore , child of mortality , love thou the merciful Father ;</l>
       <l n="206">Wish what the Holy One wishes , and not from fear , but affection</l>
       <l n="207">Fear is the virtue of slaves ; but the heart that loveth is willing</l>
       <l n="208">Perfect was before God , and perfect is Love , and Love only .</l>
       <l n="209">Lovest thou God as thou oughtest , then lovest thou likewise thy brethren :</l>
       <l n="210">One is the sun in heaven , and one , only one , is Love also .</l>
       <l n="211">Bears not each human figure the godlike stamp on his forehead</l>
       <l n="212">Readest thou not in his face thou origin ? Is he not sailing</l>
       <l n="213">Lost like thyself on an ocean unknown , and is he not guided</l>
       <l n="214">By the same stars that guide thee ? Why shouldst thou hate then thy brother ?</l>
       <l n="215">Hateth he thee , forgive ! For ‘ t is sweet to stammer one letter</l>
       <l n="216">Of the Eternal 's language ;— on earth it is called Forgiveness !</l>
       <l n="217">Knowest thou Him , who forgave , with the crown of thorns on his temples ?</l>
       <l n="218">Earnestly prayed for his foes , for his murderers ? Say , dost thou know him ?</l>
       <l n="219">Ah ! thou confessest his name , so follow likewise his example ,</l>
       <l n="220">Think of thy brother no ill , but throw a veil over his failings ,</l>
       <l n="221">Guide the erring aright ; for the good , the heavenly shepherd</l>
       <l n="222">Took the lost lamb in his arms , and bore it back to its mother .</l>
       <l n="223">This is the fruit of Love , and it is by its fruits that we know it .</l>
       <l n="224">Love is the creature 's welfare , with God ; but Love among mortals</l>
       <l n="225">Is but an endless sigh ! He longs , and endures , and stands waiting ,</l>
       <l n="226">Suffers and yet rejoices , and smiles with tears on his eyelids .</l>
       <l n="227">Hope ,— so is called upon earth , his recompense , Hope , the befriending ,</l>
       <l n="228">Does what she can , for she points evermore up to heaven , and faithful</l>
       <l n="229">Plunges her anchor 's peak in the depths of the grave , and beneath it</l>
       <l n="230">Paints a more beautiful world , a dim , but a sweet play of shadows !</l>
       <l n="231">Races , better than we , have leaned on her wavering promise ,</l>
       <l n="232">Having naught else but Hope . Then praise we our Father in heaven ,</l>
       <l n="233">Him , who has given us more ; for to us has Hope been transfigured ,</l>
       <l n="234">Groping no longer in night ; she is Faith , she is living assurance .</l>
       <l n="235">Faith is enlightened Hope ; she is light , is the eye of affection ,</l>
       <l n="236">Dreams of the longing interprets , and carves their visions in marble .</l>
       <l n="237">Faith is the sun of life ; and her countenance shines like the Hebrew 's ,</l>
       <l n="238">For she has looked upon God ; the heaven on its stable foundation</l>
       <l n="239">Draws she with chains down to earth , and the New Jerusalem sinketh</l>
       <l n="240">Splendid with portals twelve in golden vapors descending .</l>
       <l n="241">There enraptured she wanders . and looks at the figures majestic ,</l>
       <l n="242">Fears not the winged crowd , in the midst of them all is her homestead .</l>
       <l n="243">Therefore love and believe ; for works will follow spontaneous</l>
       <l n="244">Even as day does the sun ; the Right from the Good is an offspring ,</l>
       <l n="245">Love in a bodily shape ; and Christian works are no more than</l>
       <l n="246">Animate Love and faith , as flowers are the animate Springtide .</l>
       <l n="247">Works do follow us all unto God ; there stand and bear witness</l>
       <l n="248">Not what they seemed ,— but what they were only . Blessed is he who</l>
       <l n="249">Hears their confession secure ; they are mute upon earth until death 's hand</l>
       <l n="250">Opens the mouth of the silent . Ye children , does Death e'er alarm you ?</l>
       <l n="251">Death is the brother of Love , twin-brother is he , and is only</l>
       <l n="252">More austere to behold . With a kiss upon lips that are fading</l>
       <l n="253">Takes he the soul and departs , and , rocked in the arms of affection ,</l>
       <l n="254">Places the ransomed child , new born , ‘ fore the face of its father .</l>
       <l n="255">Sounds of his coming already I hear ,— see dimly his pinions ,</l>
       <l n="256">Swart as the night , but with stars strewn upon them ! I fear not before him .</l>
       <l n="257">Death is only release , and in mercy is mute . On his bosom</l>
       <l n="258">Freer breathes , in its coolness , my breast ; and face to face standing</l>
       <l n="259">Look I on God as he is , a sun unpolluted by vapors ;</l>
       <l n="260">Look on the light of the ages I loved , the spirits majestic ,</l>
       <l n="261">Nobler , better than I ; they stand by the throne all transfigured ,</l>
       <l n="262">Vested in white , and with harps of gold , and are singing an anthem ,</l>

       <l n="295">Are ye ready this day to eat of the bread of Atonement ?</l>
       <l n="296">What it denoteth , that know ye full well , I have told it you often .</l>
       <l n="297">Of the new covenant symbol it is , of Atonement a token ,</l>
       <l n="298">Stablished between earth and heaven . Man by his sins and transgressions</l>
       <l n="299">Far has wandered from God , from his essence . ‘ T was in the beginning</l>
       <l n="300">Fast by the Tree of Knowledge he fell , and it hangs its crown o'er the</l>
       <l n="301">Fall to this day ; in the Thought is the Fall ; in the Heart the Atonement .</l>
       <l n="302">Infinite is the fall ,— the Atonement infinite likewise .</l>
       <l n="303">See ! behind me , as far as the old man remembers , and forward ,</l>
       <l n="304">Far as Hope in her flight can reach with her wearied pinions ,</l>
       <l n="305">Sin and Atonement incessant go through the lifetime of mortals .</l>
       <l n="306">Sin is brought forth full-grown ; but Atonement sleeps in our bosoms</l>
       <l n="307">Still as the cradled babe ; and dreams of heaven and of angels ,</l>
       <l n="308">Cannot awake to sensation ; is like the tones in the harp 's strings ,</l>
       <l n="309">Spirits imprisoned , that wait evermore the deliverer 's finger .</l>
       <l n="310">Therefore , ye children beloved , descended the Prince of Atonement ,</l>
       <l n="311">Woke the slumberer from sleep , and she stands now with eyes all resplendent .</l>
       <l n="312">Bright as the vault of the sky , and battles with Sin and o'ercomes her .</l>
       <l n="313">Downward to earth he came and , transfigured , thence reascended ,</l>
       <l n="314">Not from the heart in like wise , for there he still lives in the Spirit ,</l>
       <l n="315">Loves and atones evermore . So long as Time is , is Atonement .</l>
       <l n="316">Therefore with reverence take this day her visible token .</l>
       <l n="317">Tokens are dead if the things live not . The light everlasting</l>
       <l n="318">Unto the blind is not , but is born of the eye that has vision .</l>
       <l n="319">Neither in bread nor in wine , but in the heart that is hallowed</l>
       <l n="320">Lieth forgiveness enshrined ; the intention alone of amendment</l>
       <l n="321">Fruits of the earth ennobles to heavenly things , and removes all</l>
       <l n="322">Sin and the guerdon of sin . Only Love with his arms wide extended ,</l>
       <l n="323">Penitence wee ping and praying ; the Will that is tried , and whose gold flows</l>
       <l n="324">Purified forth from the flames ; in a word , mankind by Atonement</l>
       <l n="325">Breaketh Atonement 's bread , and drinketh Atonement 's wine-cup .</l>
       <l n="326">But he who cometh up hither , unworthy , with hate in his bosom ,</l>
       <l n="327">Scoffing at men and at God , is guilty of Christ 's blessed body ,</l>
       <l n="328">And the Redeemer 's blood ! To himself he eateth and drinketh</l>
       <l n="329">Death and doom ! And from this , preserve us , thou heavenly Father !</l>
       <l n="330">Are ye ready , ye children , to eat of the bread of Atonement ? ”</l>
       <l n="331">Thus with emotion he asked , and together answered the children ,</l>
       <l n="332">“ Yes ! ” with deep sobs interrupted . Then read he the due supplications ,</l>
       <l n="333">Read the Form of Communion , and in chimed the organ and anthem :</l>
       <l n="334">“ O Holy Lamb of God , who takest away our transgressions ,</l>

       <l n="336">Th ’ old man , with trembling hand , and heavenly pearls on his eyelids ,</l>
       <l n="337">Filled now the chalice and paten , and dealt round the mystical symbols .</l>
       <l n="338">Oh , then seemed it to me as if God , with the broad eye of midday ,</l>
       <l n="339">Clearer looked in at the windows , and all the trees in the church yard</l>
       <l n="340">Bowed down their summits of green , and the grass on the graves ‘ gan to shiver</l>
       <l n="341">But in the children ( I noted it well ; I knew it ) there ran a</l>
       <l n="342">Tremor of holy rapture along through their ice-cold members .</l>
       <l n="343">Decked like an altar before them , there stood the green earth , and above it</l>
       <l n="344">Heaven opened itself , as of old before Stephen ; they saw there</l>
       <l n="345">Radiant in glory the Father , and on his right hand the Redeemer .</l>
       <l n="346">Under them hear they the clang of harpstrings , and angels from gold clouds</l>
       <l n="347">Beckon to them like brothers , and fan with their pinions of purple .</l>

       <l n="348">Closed was the Teacher 's task , and with heaven in their hearts and their faces ,</l>

       <l n="350">Downward to kiss that reverend hand , but all of them pressed he</l>
       <l n="351">Moved to his bosom , and laid , with a prayer , his hands full of blessings ,</l>

      <head>DEATH OF ARCHBISHOP TURPIN</head>
      <head>FROM THE CHANSON DE ROLAND</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The Archbishop , whom God loved in high degree ,</l>
       <l n="2">Beheld his wounds all bleeding fresh and free ;</l>
       <l n="3">And then his cheek more ghastly grew and wan ,</l>
       <l n="4">And a faint shudder through his members ran .</l>
       <l n="5">Upon the battle-field his knee was bent ;</l>
       <l n="6">Brave Roland saw , and to his succor went ,</l>
       <l n="7">Straightway his helmet from his brow unlaced ,</l>
       <l n="8">And tore the shining hauberk from his breast .</l>
       <l n="9">Then raising in his arms the man of God ,</l>
       <l n="10">Gently he laid him on the verdant sod .</l>
       <l n="11">“ Rest , Sire , ” he cried ,— “ for rest thy suffering needs . ”</l>
       <l n="12">The priest replied , “ Think but of warlike deeds !</l>
       <l n="13">The field is ours ; well may we boast this strife !</l>
       <l n="14">But death steals on ,— there is no hope of life ;</l>
       <l n="15">In paradise , where Almoners live again ,</l>
       <l n="16">There are our couches spread , there shall we rest from pain . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="17">Sore Roland grieved ; nor marvel I , alas !</l>
       <l n="18">That thrice he swooned upon the thick green grass .</l>
       <l n="19">When he revived , with a loud voice cried he ,</l>
       <l n="20">“ O Heavenly Father ! Holy Saint Marie !</l>
       <l n="21">Why lingers death to lay me in my grave !</l>
       <l n="22">Beloved France ! how have the good and brave</l>
       <l n="23">Been torn from thee , and left thee weak and poor ! ”</l>
       <l n="24">Then thoughts of Aude , his lady-love , came o'er</l>
       <l n="25">His spirit , and he whispered soft and slow ,</l>

       <l n="27">Never so true a liegeman shalt thou see ;—</l>

       <l n="35">He blessed them in God 's name , with faith that He</l>

       <l n="37">The Archbishop , then , on whom God 's benison rest ,</l>
       <l n="38">Exhausted , bowed his head upon his breast ;—</l>
       <l n="39">His mouth was full of dust and clotted gore ,</l>
       <l n="40">And many a wound his swollen visage bore .</l>
       <l n="41">Slow beats his heart , his panting bosom heaves ,</l>
       <l n="42">Death comes apace ,— no hope of cure relieves .</l>
       <l n="43">Towards heaven he raised his dying hands and prayed</l>
       <l n="44">That God , who for our sins was mortal made ,</l>
       <l n="45">Born of the Virgin , scorned and crucified ,</l>
       <l n="46">In paradise would place him by His side .</l>

       <l n="47">Then Turpin died in service of Charlon ,</l>

      <head>THE CELESTIAL PILOT</head>
      <head>PURGATORIO II . 13-51 .</head>
       <l n="1">And now , behold ! as at the approach of morning ,</l>
       <l n="2">Through the gross vapors , Mars grows fiery red</l>
       <l n="3">Down in the west upon the ocean floor</l>
       <l n="4">Appeared to me ,— may I again behold it !</l>
       <l n="5">A light along the sea , so swiftly coming ,</l>
       <l n="6">Its motion by no flight of wing is equalled .</l>
       <l n="7">And when therefrom I had withdrawn a little</l>
       <l n="8">Mine eyes , that I might question my conductor ,</l>
       <l n="9">Again I saw it brighter grown and larger .</l>
       <l n="10">Thereafter , on all sides of it , appeared</l>
       <l n="11">I knew not what of white , and underneath ,</l>
       <l n="12">Little by little , there came forth another .</l>
       <l n="13">My master yet had uttered not a word ,</l>
       <l n="14">While the first whiteness into wings unfolded ;</l>
       <l n="15">But , when he clearly recognized the pilot ,</l>
       <l n="16">He cried aloud : “ Quick , quick , and bow the knee !</l>
       <l n="17">Behold the Angel of God ! fold up thy hands !</l>
       <l n="18">Henceforward shalt thou see such officers !</l>
       <l n="19">See , how he scorns all human arguments ,</l>
       <l n="20">So that no oar he wants , nor other sail</l>
       <l n="21">Than his own wings , between so distant shores !</l>
       <l n="22">See , how he holds them , pointed straight to heaven ,</l>
       <l n="23">Fanning the air with the eternal pinions ,</l>
       <l n="24">That do not moult themselves like mortal hair ! ”</l>

       <l n="26">The Bird of Heaven , more glorious he appeared ,</l>
       <l n="27">So that the eye could not sustain his presence ,</l>
       <l n="28">But down I cast it ; and he came to shore</l>
       <l n="29">With a small vessel , gliding swift and light ,</l>
       <l n="30">So that the water swallowed naught thereof .</l>
       <l n="31">Upon the stern stood the Celestial Pilot !</l>
       <l n="32">Beatitude seemed written in his face !</l>
       <l n="33">And more than a hundred spirits sat within .</l>
       <l n="34">“ In exitu Israel de Aegypto ! ”</l>

       <l n="36">With whatso in that Psalm is after written .</l>
       <l n="37">Then made he sign of holy rood upon them ,</l>
       <l n="38">Whereat all cast themselves upon the shore ,</l>

       <l n="11">Of my disgrace , nor chance , nor destiny ,</l>

       <l n="9">O sweet , sweet death ! O fortunate fire that burns</l>
       <l n="10">Within me still to renovate my days ,</l>

      <head>THE NATURE OF LOVE</head>
      <head>BY GUIDO GUINIZELLI</head>
       <l n="1">To noble heart Love doth for shelter fly ,</l>
       <l n="2">As seeks the bird the forest 's leafy shade ;</l>
       <l n="3">Love was not felt till noble heart beat high ,</l>
       <l n="4">Nor before love the noble heart was made .</l>
       <l n="5">Soon as the sun 's broad flame</l>
       <l n="6">Was formed , so soon the clear light filled the air ;</l>
       <l n="7">Yet was not till he came :</l>
       <l n="8">So love springs up in noble breasts , and there</l>
       <l n="9">Has its appointed space ,</l>
       <l n="10">As heat in the bright flames finds its allotted place .</l>
       <l n="11">Kindles in noble heart the fire of love ,</l>
       <l n="12">As hidden virtue in the precious stone :</l>
       <l n="13">This virtue comes not from the stars above ,</l>
       <l n="14">Till round it the ennobling sun has shone ;</l>
       <l n="15">But when his powerful blaze</l>
       <l n="16">Has drawn forth what was vile , the stars impart</l>
       <l n="17">Strange virtue in their rays ;</l>
       <l n="18">And thus when Nature doth create the heart</l>
       <l n="19">Noble and pure and high ,</l>
       <l n="20">Like virtue from the star , love comes from woman 's eye .</l>

     <p>FROM THE LATIN</p>
     <p>VIRGIL 'S FIRST ECLOGUE</p>
     <p>MELIBOEUS . Tityrus , thou in the shade of a spreading beech-tree reclining , Meditatest , with slender pipe , the Muse of the woodlands . We our country 's bounds and pleasant pastures relinquish , We our country fly ; thou , Tityrus , stretched in the shadow , Teachest the woods to resound with the name of the fair Amaryllis .</p>
     <p>TITYRUS . O Meliboeus , a god for us this leisure created , For he will be unto me a god forever ; his altar Oftentimes shall imbue a tender lamb from our sheepfolds . He , my heifers to wander at large , and myself , as thou seest , On my rustic reed to play what I will , hath permitted .</p>
     <p>MELIBOEUS . Truly I envy not , I marvel rather ; on all sides In all the fields is such trouble . Behold , my goats I am driving , Heartsick , further away ; this one scarce , Tityrus , lead I ; For having here yeaned twins just now among the dense hazels , Hope of the flock , ah me ! on the naked flint she hath left them . Often this evil to me , if my mind had not been insensate , Oak-trees stricken by heaven predicted , as now I remember ; Often the sinister crow from the hollow ilex predicted , Nevertheless , who this god may be , O Tityrus , tell me .</p>
     <p>TITYRUS . O Meliboeus , the city that they call Rome , I imagined , Foolish I ! to be like this of ours , where often we shepherds Wonted are to drive down of our ewes the delicate offspring . Thus whelps like unto dogs had I known , and kids to their mothers , Thus to compare great things with small had I been accustomed . But this among other cities its head as far hath exalted As the cypresses do among the lissome viburnums .</p>
     <p>MELIBOEUS . And what so great occasion of seeing Rome hath possessed thee ?</p>
     <p>TITYRUS . Liberty , which , though late , looked upon me in my inertness , After the time when my beard fell whiter front me in shaving ,— Yet she looked upon me , and came to me after a long while , Since Amaryllis possesses and Galatea hath left me . For I will even confess that while Galatea possessed me Neither care of my flock nor hope of liberty was there . Though from my wattled folds there went forth many a victim , And the unctuous cheese was pressed for the city ungrateful , Never did my right hand return home heavy with money .</p>
     <p>MELIBOEUS . I have wondered why sad thou invokedst the gods , Amaryllis , And for whom thou didst suffer the apples to hang on the branches ! Tityrus hence was absent ! Thee , Tityrus , even the pine-trees , Thee , the very fountains , the very copses were calling .</p>
     <p>TITYRUS . What could I do ? No power had I to escape from my bondage , Nor had I power elsewhere to recognize gods so propitious . Here I beheld that youth , to whom each year , Meliboeus , During twice six days ascends the smoke of our altars . Here first gave he response to me soliciting favor : “ Feed as before your heifers , ye boys , and yoke up your bullocks . ”</p>
     <p>MELIBOEUS . Fortunate old man ! So then thy fields will be left thee , And large enough for thee , though naked stone and the marish All thy pasture-lands with the dreggy rush may encompass . No unaccustomed food thy gravid ewes shall endanger , Nor of the neighboring flock the dire contagion inject them . Fortunate old man ! Here among familiar rivers , And these sacred founts , shalt thou take the shadowy coolness . On this side , a hedge along the neighboring cross-road , Where Hyblaean bees ever feed on the flower of the willow , Often with gentle susurrus to fall asleep shall persuade thee . Yonder , beneath the high rock , the pruner shall sing to the breezes , Nor meanwhile shalt thy heart 's delight , the hoarse wood-pigeons , Nor the turtle-dove cease to mourn from aerial elm-trees .</p>
     <p>TITYRUS . Therefore the agile stags shall sooner feed in the ether , And the billows leave the fishes bare on the sea-shore . Sooner , the border-lands of both overpassed , shall the exiled Parthian drink of the Soane , or the German drink of the Tigris , Than the face of him shall glide away from my bosom !</p>
     <p>MELIBOEUS . But we hence shall go , a part to the thirsty Afries , Part to Scythia come , and the rapid Cretan Oaxes , And to the Britons from all the universe utterly sundered . Ah , shall I ever , a long time hence , the bounds of my country And the roof of my lowly cottage covered with greensward Seeing , with wonder behold ,— my kingdoms , a handful of wheat-ears ! Shall an impious soldier possess these lands newly cultured , And these fields of corn a barbarian ? Lo , whither discord Us wretched people hath brought ! for whom our fields we have planted ! Graft , Meliboeus , thy pear-trees now , put in order thy vine-yards . Go , my goats , go hence , my flocks so happy aforetime . Never again henceforth outstretched in my verdurous cavern Shall I behold you afar from the bushy precipice hanging . Songs no more shall I sing ; not with me , ye goats , as your shepherd , Shall ye browse on the bitter willow or blooming laburnum .</p>
     <p>TITYRUS . Nevertheless , this night together with me canst thou rest thee Here on the verdant leaves ; for us there are mellowing apples , Chestnuts soft to the touch , and clouted cream in abundance ; And the high roofs now of the villages smoke in the distance , And from the lofty mountains are falling larger the shadows .</p>
