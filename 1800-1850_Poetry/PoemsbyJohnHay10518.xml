    <docTitle><titlePart>POEMS By John Hay Note to Revised Edition</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>The Publishers of this volume , desiring to print it in an improved form , have asked me to write something by way of preface or supplement to the new edition . After some deliberation I have found myself unable to comply with this request . These pages were written in the first half of the year<date>1870</date>, a time of intense interest and importance , to<country>Spain</country>. I left<settlement>Madrid</settlement>in the memorable August of that year , passing through<settlement>Paris</settlement>when that beautiful city was lying in the torpor which followed the wild excitement of the declaration of war , and preceded the fury of despair that came with the catastrophe of Sedan . I then intended to return to<country>Spain</country>before long ; and , in fact , few years have passed since that time in which I have not nourished the dream of revisiting the Peninsula and its scenes of magic and romance . But many cares and duties have intervened ; I have never gone back to<country>Spain</country>, and I have arrived at an age when I begin to doubt if I have any castles there requiring my attention . I have therefore nothing to add to this little book . Reading it again after the lapse of many years , I find much that might be advantageously modified or omitted . But as its merits , if it have any , are merely those of youth , so also are its faults , and they are immanent and structural ; they cannot be amended without tearing the book to pieces . For this reason I have confined myself to the correction of the most obvious and flagrant errors , and can only hope the kindly reader will pass over with an indulgent smile the rapid judgments , the hot prejudices , the pitiless condemnations , the lyric eulogies , born of an honest enthusiasm and unchecked by the reserve which comes of age and experience . I venture to hope , though with some anxiety and uncertainty , that the honest enthusiasm may itself be recognized , as well as the candor which the writer tried to preserve in speaking of things which powerfully appealed to his loves and his hates . I therefore commit this book to the public once more with its imperfections on its head ; with its prophecies unfulfilled , its hopes baffled , its observations in many instances rendered obsolete by the swift progress of events . A changed Europe — far different from that which I traversed twenty years ago — suffers in a new fever-dream of war and revolution north of the Pyrenees ; and beyond those picturesque mountains the Spanish monarchy enjoys a new lease of life by favor of circumstances which demand a chronicler of more leisure than myself . I must leave what I wrote in the midst of the stirring scenes of the interregnum between the secular monarchy and the short-lived Republic — whose advent I foresaw , but whose sudden fall was veiled from my sanguine vision — without defense or apology , claiming only that it was written in good faith , from a heart filled with passionate convictions and an ardent love and devotion to what is best in<country>Spain</country>. I recorded what I saw , and my eyes were better then than now . I trust I have not too often spoken amiss of a people whose art , whose literature , whose language , and whose character compelled my highest admiration , and with whom I enjoyed friendships which are among the dearest recollections of my life .</docImprint>

       <l n="13">A keerless man in his talk was Jim ,</l>
       <l n="14">And an awkward hand in a row ,</l>
       <l n="15">But he never flunked , and he never lied ,—</l>
       <l n="16">I reckon he never knowed how .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="17">And this was all the religion he had ,—</l>

       <l n="19">Never be passed on the river</l>
       <l n="20">To mind the pilot 's bell ;</l>
       <l n="21">And if ever the Prairie Belle took fire ,—</l>
       <l n="22">A thousand times he swore ,</l>
       <l n="23">He 'd hold her nozzle agin the bank</l>
       <l n="24">Till the last soul got ashore .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="25">All boats has their day on the Mississip ,</l>

       <l n="31">With a nigger squat on her safety-valve ,</l>
       <l n="32">And her furnace crammed , rosin and pine .</l>

       <l n="36">For that willer-bank on the right .</l>
       <l n="37">There was runnin ’ and cursin ’ , but Jim yelled out ,</l>
       <l n="38">Over all the infernal roar ,</l>
       <l n="39">“ I 'll hold her nozzle agin the bank</l>

       <l n="43">And they all had trust in his cussedness ,</l>
       <l n="44">And knowed he would keep his word .</l>
       <l n="45">And , sure 's you 're born , they all got off</l>
       <l n="46">Afore the smokestacks fell ,—</l>
       <l n="47">And Bludso 's ghost went up alone</l>
       <l n="48">In the smoke of the Prairie Belle .</l>
