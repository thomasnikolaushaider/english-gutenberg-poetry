    <docDate><date>1922</date>BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION</docDate>
    <docTitle><titlePart>By J. W. Mackail William Morris , one of the most eminent imaginative writers of the Victorian age , differs from most other poets and men of letters in two ways — first , he did great work in many other things as well as in literature ; secondly , he had beliefs of his own about the meaning and conduct of life , about all that men think and do and make , very different from those of ordinary people , and he carried out these views in his writings as well as in all the other work he did throughout his life .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>He was born in<date>1834</date>. His father , a member of a business firm in the City of<settlement>London</settlement>, was a wealthy man and lived in Essex , in a country house with large gardens and fields belonging to it , on the edge of Epping Forest . Until the age of thirteen Morris was at home among a large family of brothers and sisters . He delighted in the country life and especially in the Forest , which is one of the most romantic parts of<country>England</country>, and which he made the scene of many real and imaginary adventures . From fourteen to eighteen he was at school at Marlborough among the Wiltshire downs , in a country full of beauty and history , and close to another of the ancient forests of<country>England</country>, that of Savernake . He proceeded from school to Exeter College ,<settlement>Oxford</settlement>, where he soon formed a close friendship with a remarkable set of young men of his own age ; chief among these , and Morris 's closest friend for the rest of his life , was Edward Burne-Jones , the painter . Study of the works of John Ruskin confirmed them in the admiration which they already felt for the life and art of the Middle Ages . In the summer vacation of<date>1855</date>the two friends went to Northern<country>France</country>to see the beautiful towns and splendid churches with which that country had been filled between the eleventh and the fifteenth centuries ; and there they made up their minds that they cared for art more than for anything else , such as wealth or ease or the opinion of the world , and that as soon as they left<settlement>Oxford</settlement>they would become artists . By art they meant the making of beauty for the adornment and enrichment of human life , and as artists they meant to strive against all that was ugly or mean or untruthful in the life of their own time . Art , as they understood it , is one single thing covering the whole of life but practised in many special forms that differ one from another . Among these many forms of art there are two of principal importance . One of the two is the art which is concerned with the making and adorning of the houses in which men and women live ; that is to say , architecture , with all its attendant arts of decoration , including sculpture , painting , the designing and ornamenting of metal , wood and glass , carpets , paper-hangings , woven , dyed and embroidered cloths of all kinds , and all the furniture which a house may have for use or pleasure . The other is the art which is concerned with the making and adorning of stories in prose and verse . Both of these kinds of art were practised by Morris throughout his life . The former was his principal occupation ; he made his living by it , and built up in it a business which alone made him famous , and which has had a great influence towards bringing more beauty into daily domestic life in<country>England</country>and in other countries also . His profession was thus that of a manufacturer , designer , and decorator . When he had to describe himself by a single word , he called himself a designer . But it is the latter branch of his art which principally concerns us now , the art of a maker and adorner of stories . He became famous in this kind of art also , both in prose and verse , as a romance-writer and a poet . But he spoke of it as play rather than work , and although he spent much time and great pains on it , he regarded it as relaxation from the harder and more constant work of his life , which was carrying on the business of designing , painting , weaving , dyeing , printing and other occupations of that kind . In later life he also gave much of his time to political and social work , with the object of bringing back mankind into a path from which they had strayed since the end of the Middle Ages , and creating a state of society in which art , by the people and for the people , a joy to the maker and the user , might be naturally , easily , and universally produced . Even as a boy Morris had been noted for his love of reading and inventing tales ; but he did not begin to write any until he had been for a couple of years at<settlement>Oxford</settlement>. His earliest poems and his earliest written prose tales belong to the same year ,<date>1855</date>, in which he determined to make art his profession . The first of either that he published appeared in the<settlement>Oxford</settlement>and<settlement>Cambridge</settlement>Magazine , which was started and managed by him and his friends in<date>1856</date>. In<date>1858</date>, after he had left<settlement>Oxford</settlement>, he brought out a volume of poems called , after the title of the first poem in the book , “ The Defence of Guenevere . ” Soon afterwards he founded , with some of his old<settlement>Oxford</settlement>friends and others whom he had made in<settlement>London</settlement>, among whom Dante Gabriel Rossetti was the leading spirit , the firm of Morris and Company , manufacturers and decorators . His business , in which he was the principal and finally the sole partner , took up the main part of his time . He had also married , and built himself a beautiful small house in Kent , the decoration of which went busily on for several years . Among all these other occupations he almost gave up writing stories , but never ceased reading and thinking about them . In<date>1865</date>he came back to live in<settlement>London</settlement>, where , being close to his work , he had more leisure for other things ; and between<date>1865</date>and<date>1870</date>he wrote between thirty and forty tales in verse , containing not less than seventy or eighty thousand lines in all . The longest of these tales , “ The Life and Death of Jason , ” appeared in<date>1867</date>. It is the old Greek story of the ship Argo and the voyage in quest of the Golden Fleece . Twenty-five other tales are included in “ The Earthly Paradise , ” published in three parts between<date>1868</date>and<date>1870</date>. During these years Morris learned Icelandic , and his next published works were translations of some of the Icelandic sagas , writings composed from six to nine hundred years ago , and containing a mass of legends , histories and romances finely told in a noble language . These translations were followed in<date>1876</date>by his great epic poem , “ Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs . ” In that poem he retold a story of which an Icelandic version , the “ Volsunga Saga , ” written in the twelfth century , is one of the world 's masterpieces . It is the great epic of Northern Europe , just as the “ Iliad ” and “ Odyssey ” of Homer are the chief epics of ancient Greece , and the “ Æneid ” of Virgil the chief epic of the Roman Empire . Morris 's love for these great stories of ancient times led him to rewrite the tale of the Volsungs and Niblungs , which he reckoned the finest of them all , more fully and on a larger scale than it had ever been written before . He had already , in<date>1875</date>, translated the “ Æneid ” into verse , and some ten years later , in<date>1886-87</date>, he also made a verse translation of the “ Odyssey . ” In<date>1873</date>he had also written another very beautiful poem , “ Love is Enough , ” containing the story of three pairs of lovers , a countryman and country-woman , an emperor and empress , and a prince and peasant girl . This poem was written in the form of a play , not of a narrative . To write prose was at first for Morris more difficult than to write poetry . Verse came naturally to him , and he composed in prose only with much effort until after long practice . Except for his early tales in the<settlement>Oxford</settlement>and<settlement>Cambridge</settlement>Magazine and his translations of Icelandic sagas , he wrote little but poetry until the year<date>1882</date>. About that time he began to give lectures and addresses , and wrote them in great numbers during the latter part of his life . A number of them were collected and published in two volumes called “ Hopes and Fears for Art ” and “ Signs of Change , ” and many others have been published separately . He thus gradually accustomed himself to prose composition . For several years he was too busy with other things , which he thought more important , to spend time on storytelling ; but his instinct forced itself out again , and in<date>1886</date>he began the series of romances in prose or in mixed prose and verse which went on during the next ten years . The chief of these are , “ A Dream of John Ball , ” “ The House of Wolfings , ” “ The Roots of the Mountains , ” “ News from Nowhere , ” “ The Glittering Plain , ” “ The Wood beyond the World , ” “ The Well at the World 's End , ” “ The Water of the Wondrous Isles , ” and “ The Sundering Flood . ” During the same years he also translated , out of Icelandic and old French books , more of the stories which he had long known and admired . “ The Sundering Flood ” was written in his last illness , and finished by him within a few days of his death , in the autumn of<date>1896</date>.</docImprint>

  <body>
   <p>The story of Sigurd is important to English people not only for its wondrous beauty , but also on account of its great age , and of what it tells us about our own Viking ancestors , who first knew the story .</p>
   <p>The tale was known all over the north of Europe , in Denmark , in Germany , in Norway and Sweden , and in Iceland , hundreds of years before it was written down . Sometimes different names were given to the characters , sometimes the events of the story were slightly altered , but in the main points it was one and the same tale .</p>
   <p>If we look at a map of Europe showing the nations as they were rather more than a thousand years ago , we see the names of Saxons , Goths , Danes , and Frisians marked on the lands around the Baltic Sea . Those who bore these names were the makers of the tale of Sigurd . The name of the Saxons is , of course , the best known to us , and next in importance come the people we call Danes , or Northmen , or Vikings , who attacked the coasts of the Saxon kingdoms in England . The Saxons came from part of the land that is now known as Germany , and the Vikings from Denmark and from Scandinavia .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">A third important tribe was that of the Goths , who dwelt first in</l>
     <l n="2">South Sweden , and then in Germany .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>All these people resembled one another in their way of life , in their religion , and in their ideas of what deeds were good and what were evil . Their lands were barren — too mountainous or too cold to bring forth fruitful crops , and their homes were not such as would tempt men never to leave them . So , though they built their little groups of wooden houses in the valleys of their lands , and made fields and pastures about them , these were often left to the care of the women and the feeble men , while the strong men made raids over the sea to other countries , where they engaged in the fighting which they loved , and whence they brought back plunder to their homes . North , South , East , and West they went , till few parts of Europe had not learnt to know and fear them .</p>
   <p>Their ships were long and narrow , driven often by oars as well as sails , and outside them , along the bulwarks , the crew hung their round shields made of yellow wood from the lime-tree . The men wore byrnies or breast-plates , and helmets , and they were armed with swords , long spears , or heavy battle-axes . They were enemies none could afford to despise , for they had great stature and strength of body , joined to such fierceness and delight in war that they held a man disgraced if he died peacefully at home . Moreover , they knew nothing of mercy to the conquered .</p>
   <p>Courage , not only to fight , but also to bear suffering without impatience or complaint , and the virtue of faithfulness were the qualities they most honoured . To be wanting in courage was disgraceful in their eyes , but it was equally disgraceful to refuse to help kinsfolk , to lie , to deceive , or to desert a chief .</p>
   <p>If they put their enemies to death with fearful tortures , they did not treat them more severely than the traitors they discovered among themselves , and if they had no pity for those they conquered , yet they knew well how to admire great leaders , and how to serve them faithfully . But we can best realise their ideas on these matters by considering their religion and their stories .</p>
   <p>They worshipped one chief god , Odin , and other gods and goddesses who were his children . Odin was often called All-father because he was the helper and friend of human beings , and appeared on earth in the form of an old man , “ one-eyed and seeming ancient , ” with cloud-blue hood and grey cloak . He had courage , strength , and wondrous wisdom , for he knew all events that happened in the world , and he understood the speech of birds , and all kinds of charms and magic arts . Men served him by brave fighting in a good cause , and when they perished in battle he received their souls in his dwelling of Valhalla in the city of Asgard , where they spent each day in warfare , and where at evening the dead were revived , the wounded healed , and all feasted together in Odin 's palace . There they fed upon the flesh of the boar Saehrimner , which was renewed as fast as it was eaten . Certain maidens called Valkyrie , or Choosers of the Slain , were Odin 's messengers whom he sent forth into the battles of the world to find the warriors whom he had appointed to die , and to bring them to Valhalla .</p>
   <p>In the story of Sigurd Odin has a very important part to play , but for the understanding of the tale it is necessary to know something about another of the gods . This is Loki , who , though sprung from the race of the giants , yet lived with the sons of Odin in Asgard , behaving sometimes as their trusty helper , but more often as their cunning enemy . He caused much wretchedness , not only among the gods , but on earth also , for he delighted in the sight of misery . His vices were all those most hateful to the Norse people , for he was before all things a liar , a deceiver , a faith-breaker , a skilful worker of mischief by guile instead of by fair fight . There are many stories of his cunning thefts , of the miseries he wrought among his companions , and of his envy of the beloved god Balder , whom he slew by a trick . His children were terrible monsters , as hated as himself . Yet , strange to say , Loki was Odin 's companion in many of his adventures .</p>
   <p>The gods inhabited Asgard , a city standing on a high mountain in the middle of the world . Odin 's palace of Valhalla was there , and other palaces for his sons and daughters . All round Asgard lay Midgard , or the ordinary world of men and women . Its caves and waste places were inhabited by dwarfs , whom Odin had banished from the light of day for various ill deeds . They were a spiteful and cunning race , jealous of mankind , and eager to recover their lost power . Their strength lay in their wondrous skill in handicraft , for they could forge more deadly weapons , and fashion more lovely jewels than any made by the hands of men . But , though possessed of wisdom , they had no spirit of kindness , no respect for right , and no dislike of wrong .</p>
   <p>Around Midgard lay the sea , and beyond that Utgard , a hideous frozen country inhabited by giants , enemies of the gods .</p>
   <p>But this arrangement of the world was only for a season . The gods themselves looked forward to a time of defeat and death , when Asgard should perish in flames and the world with it , and the sun and moon should be darkened , and they themselves should be slain . This great day was called Ragnarok , or sometimes the Twilight of the Gods . Then Loki would gather giants and monsters to a great battle against the gods , who would slay their enemies , but who would themselves fall in the struggle . The sea would drown the earth , the stars would fall , and all things would pass away .</p>
   <p>This terrible fate the gods awaited with calm and cheerfulness , showing even greater courage than in their many deeds of war . They had to submit to this fate , for there were three beings even greater than they . These were the Norns , deciders of the fate of gods and men alike . They were three giant maidens who dwelt by a sacred , wisdom-giving fountain , and who controlled the lives of men , giving to each sickness and health , success and failure and death when they would . No man or god might escape what the Norns decreed for him .</p>
   <p>Many stories of these gods , together with tales of famous men , were told among the northern peoples . These stories were passed on from one to another by word of mouth , till they grew much longer and fuller , and the happening of certain historical events helped to take them from country to country .</p>
   <p>As we have seen , all the races of the North were warlike and eager for adventure , and so when trouble came upon them in their own homes , they readily took to the sea to plunder the coasts or to conquer other lands . Between 800 and 900 A. D ., when the Danes were invading England , many were driven from Norway because they refused to submit to a king called Harold Fairhair , and when he pursued them to the Orkney and Faroe Islands they took refuge on the coasts of Iceland . There they settled , built themselves wooden houses , planted such crops as would grow in that bleak land , and founded a commonwealth . Little by little they left the old Viking life , and it lived only in their songs and stories .</p>
   <p>They had come to Iceland with a vast stock of tales in poetry , which were related or sung by professional poets , called skalds , at all kinds of feasts and gatherings . The skalds arranged and improved the old stories , but they were not written down until about the time of our King Stephen , when some unknown writer collected them into one book called the Elder Edda . Very soon after this another book was written containing the same stories in prose and called the Younger or Prose Edda . In this way many of the old poems , and a great many stories containing much information about the religion which the people took with them to Iceland , have been preserved .</p>
   <p>But it was from neither of the Eddas that William Morris took his story of Sigurd .</p>
   <p>All through the period from 800 A. D. till about the time of Henry III . of England , the skalds had been re-telling many of the poetic stories in prose , and as the people grew more civilised , one tale after another was written down in its new form .</p>
   <p>These prose tales were called Sagas , and among the very greatest is the Volsunga Saga , or Story of Sigurd . It is a tale which has been told in other lands besides Iceland . We read part of the same story in the Old English poem of Beowulf , and in Germany it was made into a great poem called the Nibelungenlied . The German musician , Richard Wagner , set it to music in a famous series of operas called the Nibelungen Ring . But his tale differs in many points from that contained in Morris 's poem , for Morris chose the old saga as it was written in Iceland , not the German story . On this he founded his poem , adding much beautiful description , and greatly lengthening the whole .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The story deals first with a certain King Volsung , to whose son ,</l>
     <l n="2">Sigmund , Odin presented a magic sword .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But Siggeir , the jealous king of the Goths , slew Volsung , and took Sigmund prisoner that he might have the sword for himself . Only after many toils and perils did Sigmund win it back and reign in his father 's kingdom . At last in his old age he fell in battle and the sword of Odin was shattered . But his wife , Queen Hiordis , kept the fragments for the son who was born to her soon after in Denmark , whither she fled for safety . This son of Sigmund and Hiordis was Sigurd the Volsung . He was brought up in Denmark and grew strong and beautiful , brave , kind of heart , and utterly truthful in word and deed .</p>
   <p>When he became a man he longed to win fame and kingship by mighty deeds , and when his tutor told him of a great dragon that guarded a hoard of ill-gotten gold in the mountains , he resolved to kill it . So the fragments of Odin 's sword were forged into a new blade , and Sigurd slew the dragon and took the gold , but with it he brought on himself a curse which had been put upon the treasure by the dwarf from whom it had been stolen .</p>
   <p>Sigurd then found and wakened Brynhild , a maiden who lay in an enchanted sleep upon a high mountain . They loved one another , and Sigurd gave her a ring from the dragon 's treasure , promising to return and marry her .</p>
   <p>Then the curse led him to join with the fierce and treacherous Niblungs or Cloudy People . Their king and his mother grew jealous when they saw Sigurd more mighty and more beloved than themselves , and by enchantments they caused him to forget Brynhild , to wed the princess Gudrun , and at last to aid the Niblung king , Gunnar , to win Brynhild for his own wife .</p>
   <p>Then the curse of the gold brought death to many , for Sigurd and Brynhild discovered all the treachery of the Niblungs , who , in their anger , slew Sigurd , and Brynhild killed herself that she might not live and sorrow for him .</p>
   <p>Such is the story of Sigurd as it was told a thousand years ago in distant Iceland , and as it is retold in this poem by William Morris .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">There was a dwelling of Kings ere the world was waxen old ;</l>
     <l n="4">Dukes were the door-wards there , and the roofs were thatched with gold :</l>
     <l n="5">Earls were the wrights that wrought it , and silver nailed its doors ;</l>
     <l n="6">Earls ’ wives were the weaving-women , queens ’ daughters strewed its floors ,</l>
     <l n="7">And the masters of its song-craft were the mightiest men that cast</l>
     <l n="8">The sails of the storm of battle adown the bickering blast .</l>
     <l n="9">There dwelt men merry-hearted , and in hope exceeding great</l>
     <l n="10">Met the good days and the evil as they went the way of fate :</l>
     <l n="11">There the Gods were unforgotten , yea whiles they walked with men ,</l>
     <l n="12">Though e'en in that world 's beginning rose a murmur now and again</l>
     <l n="13">Of the midward time and the fading and the last of the latter days ,</l>
     <l n="14">And the entering in of the terror , and the death of the People 's Praise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">Thus was the dwelling of Volsung , the King of the Midworld 's Mark ,</l>
     <l n="16">As a rose in the winter season , a candle in the dark ;</l>
     <l n="17">And as in all other matters ‘ twas all earthly houses ’ crown ,</l>
     <l n="18">And the least of its wall-hung shields was a battle-world 's renown ,</l>
     <l n="19">So therein withal was a marvel and a glorious thing to see ,</l>
     <l n="20">For amidst of its midmost hall-floor sprang up a mighty tree ,</l>
     <l n="21">That reared its blessings roofward , and wreathed the roof-tree dear</l>
     <l n="22">With the glory of the summer and the garland of the year .</l>
     <l n="23">I know not how they called it ere Volsung changed his life ,</l>
     <l n="24">But his dawning of fair promise , and his noontide of the strife ,</l>
     <l n="25">His eve of the battle-reaping and the garnering of his fame ,</l>
     <l n="26">Have bred us many a story and named us many a name ;</l>
     <l n="27">And when men tell of Volsung , they call that war-duke 's tree ,</l>
     <l n="28">That crowned stem , the Branstock ; and so was it told unto me .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="29">So there was the throne of Volsung beneath its blossoming bower ,</l>
     <l n="30">But high o'er the roof-crest red it rose ‘ twixt tower and tower ,</l>
     <l n="31">And therein were the wild hawks dwelling , abiding the dole of their lord ;</l>
     <l n="32">And they wailed high over the wine , and laughed to the waking sword .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">Still were its boughs but for them , when lo , on an even of May</l>
     <l n="34">Comes a man from Siggeir the King with a word for his mouth to say :</l>
     <l n="35">“ All hail to thee King Volsung , from the King of the Goths I come :</l>
     <l n="36">He hath heard of thy sword victorious and thine abundant home ;</l>
     <l n="37">He hath heard of thy sons in the battle , the fillers of Odin 's Hall ;</l>
     <l n="38">And a word hath the west-wind blown him , ( full fruitful be its fall ! )</l>
     <l n="39">A word of thy daughter Signy the crown of womanhood :</l>
     <l n="40">Now he deems thy friendship goodly , and thine help in the battle good ,</l>
     <l n="41">And for these will he give his friendship and his battle-aid again :</l>
     <l n="42">But if thou wouldst grant his asking , and make his heart full fain ,</l>
     <l n="43">Then shalt thou give him a matter , saith he , without a price ,</l>
     <l n="44">— Signy the fairer than fair , Signy the wiser than wise . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Now the message gladdened Volsung and his sons , but no word spake Signy , till the king asked her what her mind might be . Then said Signy , “ I will wed the Goth king , and yet shall I rue my lot in his hall . ” And Volsung urged her with kind words to do nought against her will , but her mind was fixed , and she said she wrought but what the gods had fore-ordained . So the earl of Siggeir went his way with gifts and fair words , bidding the Goth king come ere a month was over to wed the white-handed Signy and bear her home .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">So on Mid-Summer Even ere the undark night began</l>
     <l n="2">Siggeir the King of the Goth-folk went up from the bath of the swan</l>
     <l n="3">Unto the Volsung dwelling with many an Earl about ;</l>
     <l n="4">There through the glimmering thicket the linked mail rang out ,</l>
     <l n="5">And sang as mid the woodways sings the summer-hidden ford :</l>
     <l n="6">There were gold-rings God-fashioned , and many a Dwarf-wrought sword ,</l>
     <l n="7">And many a Queen-wrought kirtle and many a written spear ;</l>
     <l n="8">So came they to the acres , and drew the threshold near ,</l>
     <l n="9">And amidst of the garden blossoms , on the grassy , fruit-grown land ,</l>
     <l n="10">Was Volsung the King of the Wood-world with his sons on either hand ;</l>
     <l n="11">Therewith down lighted Siggeir the lord of a mighty folk ,</l>
     <l n="12">Yet showed he by King Volsung as the bramble by the oak ,</l>
     <l n="13">Nor reached his helm to the shoulder of the least of Volsung 's sons .</l>
     <l n="14">And so into the hall they wended , the Kings and their mighty ones ;</l>
     <l n="15">And they dight the feast full glorious , and drank through the death of the</l>
     <l n="16">day ,</l>
     <l n="17">Till the shadowless moon rose upward , till it wended white away ;</l>
     <l n="18">Then they went to the gold-hung beds , and at last for an hour or twain</l>
     <l n="19">Were all things still and silent , save a flaw of the summer rain .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="20">But on the morrow noontide when the sun was high and bare ,</l>
     <l n="21">More glorious was the banquet , and now was Signy there ,</l>
     <l n="22">And she sat beside King Siggeir , a glorious bride forsooth ;</l>
     <l n="23">Ruddy and white was she wrought as the fair-stained sea-beast 's tooth ,</l>
     <l n="24">But she neither laughed nor spake , and her eyes were hard and cold ,</l>
     <l n="25">And with wandering side-long looks her lord would she behold .</l>
     <l n="26">That saw Sigmund her brother , the eldest Volsung son ,</l>
     <l n="27">And oft he looked upon her , and their eyes met now and anon ,</l>
     <l n="28">And ruth arose in his heart , and hate of Siggeir the Goth ,</l>
     <l n="29">And there had he broken the wedding , but for plighted promise and troth .</l>
     <l n="30">But those twain were beheld of Siggeir , and he deemed of the Volsung kin ,</l>
     <l n="31">That amid their might and their malice small honour should he win ;</l>
     <l n="32">Yet thereof made he no semblance , but abided times to be ,</l>
     <l n="33">And laughed out with the loudest , amid the hope and the glee .</l>
     <l n="34">And nought of all saw Volsung , as he dreamed of the coming glory ,</l>

     <l n="36">So round about the Branstock they feast in the gleam of the gold ;</l>
     <l n="37">And though the deeds of man-folk were not yet waxen old ,</l>
     <l n="38">Yet had they tales for songcraft , and the blossomed garth of rhyme ;</l>
     <l n="39">Tales of the framing of all things and the entering in of time</l>
     <l n="40">From the halls of the outer heaven ; so near they knew the door .</l>
     <l n="41">Wherefore uprose a sea-king , and his hands that loved the oar</l>
     <l n="42">Now dealt with the rippling harp-gold , and he sang of the shaping of earth ,</l>
     <l n="43">And how the stars were lighted , and where the winds had birth ,</l>
     <l n="44">And the gleam of the first of summers on the yet untrodden grass .</l>
     <l n="45">But e'en as men 's hearts were hearkening some heard the thunder pass</l>

     <l n="51">As the latter morning sundog when the storm is on the way :</l>
     <l n="52">A bill he bore on his shoulder , whose mighty ashen beam</l>
     <l n="53">Burnt bright with the flame of the sea and the blended silver 's gleam .</l>
     <l n="54">And such was the guise of his raiment as the Volsung elders had told</l>

     <l n="56">So strode he to the Branstock nor greeted any lord ,</l>

     <l n="122">So Volsung laughed , and answered : “ I will set me to the toil ,</l>

     <l n="130">Then he laid his hand on the Branstock , and cried : “ O tree beloved ,</l>

     <l n="134">Then as a young man laughed he , and on the hilts of gold</l>
     <l n="135">His hand , the battle-breaker , took fast and certain hold ,</l>
     <l n="136">And long he drew and strained him , but mended not the tale ,</l>
     <l n="137">Yet none the more thereover his mirth of heart did fail ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="164">He lifted his eyes as he thought it , for now was he come to his place ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="180">But Sigmund laughed and answered , and he spake a scornful word :</l>

     <l n="190">Black then was the heart of Siggeir , but his face grew pale and red ,</l>

     <l n="192">“ Nay , pardon me , Signy 's kinsman ! when the heart desires o'ermuch</l>

     <l n="203">Then speedily answered Volsung : “ No king of the earth might scorn</l>

     <l n="206">But let two months wear over , for I have many a thing</l>

     <l n="208">And thou meanwhile here abiding of all my goods shalt be free ,</l>
     <l n="209">And then shall we twain together roof over the glass-green sea</l>
     <l n="210">With the sides of our golden dragons ; and our war-hosts ’ blended shields</l>

   <p>Then the feast sped on the fairer , far into the night , but amidst the mirth Sigmund and Signy were sad at heart . And before the sun was risen next day Signy came to her father in secret and begged him to stay in his own country rather than trust the guileful heart and murder-loving hand of Siggeir . But Volsung answered that he must go to be Siggeir 's guest , for he could not break his pledged word through fear of peril . So on the morrow the smooth-speeched Siggeir departed with Signy , and when two months were passed Volsung made ready to visit them .</p>

     <l n="20">And the bright blade gleamed to the heavens , and he cast the sheath to the</l>
     <l n="21">ground .</l>
     <l n="22">Then up the steep came the Goth-folk , and the spear-wood drew anigh ,</l>
     <l n="23">And earth 's face shook beneath them , yet cried they never a cry ;</l>
     <l n="24">And the Volsungs stood all silent , although forsooth at whiles</l>
     <l n="25">O'er the faces grown earth-weary would play the flickering smiles ,</l>
     <l n="26">And swords would clink and rattle : not long had they to bide ,</l>
     <l n="27">For soon that flood of murder flowed round the hillock-side ;</l>
     <l n="28">Then at last the edges mingled , and if men forbore the shout ,</l>
     <l n="29">Yet the din of steel and iron in the grey clouds rang about ;</l>
     <l n="30">But how to tell of King Volsung , and the valour of his folk !</l>
     <l n="31">Three times the wood of battle before their edges broke ;</l>
     <l n="32">And the shield-wall , sorely dwindled and reft of the ruddy gold ,</l>
     <l n="33">Against the drift of the war-blast for the fourth time yet did hold .</l>
     <l n="34">But men 's shields were waxen heavy with the weight of shafts they bore ,</l>
     <l n="35">And the fifth time many a champion cast earthward Odin 's door</l>
     <l n="36">And gripped the sword two-handed ; and in sheaves the spears came on .</l>
     <l n="37">And at last the host of the Goth-folk within the shield-wall won ,</l>
     <l n="38">And wild was the work within it , and oft and o'er again</l>
     <l n="39">Forth brake the sons of Volsung , and drave the foe in vain ;</l>
     <l n="40">For the driven throng still thickened , till it might not give aback .</l>
     <l n="41">But fast abode King Volsung amid the shifting wrack</l>
     <l n="42">In the place where once was the forefront : for he said : “ My feet are old ,</l>
     <l n="43">And if I wend on further there is nought more to behold</l>
     <l n="44">Than this that I see about me . ” — Whiles drew his foes away</l>
     <l n="45">And stared across the corpses that before his sword-edge lay .</l>
     <l n="46">But nought he followed after : then needs must they in front</l>
     <l n="47">Thrust on by the thickening spear-throng come up to bear the brunt ,</l>
     <l n="48">Till all his limbs were weary and his body rent and torn :</l>
     <l n="49">Then he cried : “ Lo now , Allfather , is not the swathe well shorn ?</l>
     <l n="50">Wouldst thou have me toil for ever , nor win the wages due ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="51">And mid the hedge of foemen his blunted sword he threw ,</l>
     <l n="52">And , laid like the oars of a longship the level war-shafts pressed</l>
     <l n="53">On ‘ gainst the unshielded elder , and clashed amidst his breast ;</l>
     <l n="54">And dead he fell , thrust backward , and rang on the dead men 's gear :</l>
     <l n="55">But still for a certain season durst no man draw anear ,</l>
     <l n="56">For ‘ twas e'en as a great God 's slaying , and they feared the wrath of</l>
     <l n="57">the sky ;</l>
     <l n="58">And they deemed their hearts might harden if awhile they should let him lie .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="59">Of the ending of all Volsung 's Sons save Sigmund only , and of how</l>
     <l n="60">he abideth in the wild wood .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>They joined battle again , but the fight grew feeble after Volsung fell , and his earls were struck down one by one . Last of all , his sons were borne to earth and carried captive to the hall , where Siggeir awaited them , for he himself had feared to face the Volsung swords .</p>
   <p>Then he would have slain them at once without torture , but Signy besought him that they might breathe the earthly air a day or two before their death , and he listened to her , for he saw how he might thus give them greater pain . He bade his men lead them to a glade in the forest and fetter them to the mightiest tree that grew there . So the ten Volsungs were fettered with iron to a great oak , and on the morrow Siggeir 's woodmen told him sweet tidings , for beasts of the wood had devoured two and left their bones in the fetters . So it befell every night till the woodmen brought word that nothing remained of the king 's foemen save their bones in the fetters that had bound them .</p>
   <p>Now a watch had been set on Signy lest she should send help to her brethren , but henceforth no man hindered her from going out to the wood . So that night she came to the glade in the forest , and saw in the midst of it a mighty man who was toiling to dig a grave in the greensward .</p>
   <p>And behold , it was Sigmund the Volsung : but she cried and had no fear :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ If thou art living , Sigmund , what day 's work dost thou here</l>
     <l n="2">In the midnight and the forest ? but if thou art nought but a ghost</l>
     <l n="3">Then where are those Volsung brethren , of whom thou wert best and most ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">Then he turned about unto her , and his raiment was fouled and torn ,</l>
     <l n="5">And his eyen were great and hollow , as a famished man forlorn ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">But he cried : “ Hail , Sister Signy ! I looked for thee before ,</l>
     <l n="7">Though what should a woman compass , she one alone and no more ,</l>
     <l n="8">When all we shielded Volsungs did nought in Siggeir 's land ?</l>
     <l n="9">O yea , I am living indeed , and this labour of mine hand</l>
     <l n="10">Is to bury the bones of the Volsungs ; and lo , it is well-nigh done .</l>
     <l n="11">So draw near , Volsung 's daughter , and pile we many a stone</l>
     <l n="12">Where lie the grey wolf 's gleanings of what was once so good . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">So she set her hand to the labour , and they toiled , they twain in the wood ,</l>
     <l n="14">And when the work was over , dead night was beginning to fall :</l>
     <l n="15">Then spake the white-hand Signy : “ Now shall thou tell the tale</l>
     <l n="16">Of the death of the Volsung brethren ere the wood thy wrath shall hide ,</l>
     <l n="17">Ere I wend me back sick-hearted in the dwelling of kings to abide . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="18">Then said Sigmund :</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ We lay fettered to the tree and at midnight there came from the thicket two mighty wood-wolves , and falling on my brethren Gylfi and Geirmund , they devoured them in their bonds , and turned again to the forest . Night after night , my sister , this befell , till I was left alone with our brother Sigi to await the wood-beasts . Then came midnight , and one of the wolves fell upon Sigi and the other turned on me . But I met it with snarling like its own , and my teeth gripped its throat , and my hands strove with the fetters till they burst . So I slew the beast with my irons , but when I looked , Sigi lay dead , and the other wolf had fled again to the thicket . Then I lay hid till Siggeir 's woodmen had looked on the place and departed with their tidings , and as I beheld them I knew that pity was killed in my heart , and that henceforward I should live but to avenge me on him who hath so set the gods at nought . ” Then Signy spake noble words of comfort , saying : “ I wot well that Siggeir shall pay the due price of his deeds , though the vengeance may tarry long , and I wot also that thy life shall yet know gladness . Bear a stout heart , therefore , to meet the waiting time , and make thee a lair in the woods whence thou mayest fall on men of the Goth-folk , and win what thy life needeth . As for me , I will see thy face once again ere many days are past to wot where thou dwellest and then must we meet no more . ”</p>
   <p>And so saying , she kissed him and departed , but Sigmund turned in the dawn-light , and sought a wood-lair as she had bidden him .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Of the fostering of Sinfiotli , Signy 's son , and of the slaying of</l>
     <l n="2">Siggeir the Goth-king .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">So wrought is the will of King Siggeir , and he weareth Odin 's sword</l>
     <l n="4">And it lies on his knees in the council and hath no other lord :</l>
     <l n="5">And he sendeth earls o'er the sea-flood to take King Volsung 's land ,</l>
     <l n="6">And those scattered and shepherdless sheep must come beneath his hand .</l>
     <l n="7">And he holdeth the milk-white Signy as his handmaid and his wife ,</l>
     <l n="8">And nought but his will she doeth , nor raiseth a word of strife ;</l>
     <l n="9">So his heart is praising his wisdom , and he deems him of most avail</l>
     <l n="10">Of all the lords of the cunning that teacheth how to prevail .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">Now Sigmund dwelt long in the wild-wood , abiding in a strong cave deep</l>
     <l n="12">hidden in a thicket by the river-side .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>And now and again he fell upon the folk of Siggeir as they journeyed , and slew them , and thus he had war-gear and gold as much as he would . Also he became a master of masters in the smithying craft , and the folk who beheld the gleam of his forge by night , deemed that a king of the Giants was awakened from death to dwell there , and they durst not wander near the cavern .</p>
   <p>So passed the years till on a springtide morning Signy sent forth to Sigmund a damsel leading her eldest son , a child of ten summers , and bearing a word of her mouth to bid him foster the child for his helper , if he should prove worthy and bold-hearted . And Sigmund heeded her words and fostered the child for the space of three months even though he could give no love to a son of Siggeir .</p>
   <p>At last he was minded to try the boy 's courage , to which end he set a deadly ash-grey adder in the meal-sack , and bade the child bake bread . But he feared when he found something that moved in the meal and had not courage to do the task . Then would Sigmund foster him no longer , but thrust him out from the woods to return to his father 's hall .</p>
   <p>So ten years won over again , and Signy sent another son to the wild-wood , and the lad was called Sinfiotli . Sigmund thrust him into many dangers , and burdened him with heavy loads , and he bore all passing well .</p>
   <p>Now after a year Sigmund deemed that the time for his testing was come , and once again he set an adder in the meal-sack and bade the lad bake bread . And the boy feared not the worm , but kneaded it with the dough and baked all together . So Sigmund cherished him as his own son , and he grew strong and valiant and loved Sigmund as his father .</p>
   <p>Now Sigmund began to ponder how he might at last take vengeance on Siggeir , and gladly did Sinfiotli hear him , for all his love was given to Sigmund , so that he no longer deemed himself the Goth-king 's son .</p>
   <p>At last when the long mirk nights of winter were come , Sigmund and his foster-son went their way to the home of Siggeir and sought to lurk therein . Then Sinfiotli led the way to a storehouse where lay great wine-casks , and whence they could see the lighted feast-hall , and hear the clamour of Siggeir 's folk . There they had to abide the time when the feasters should be hushed in sleep . Long seemed the hours to Sinfiotli , but Sigmund was calm and clear-eyed .</p>
   <p>Then it befell that two of Queen Signy 's youngest-born children threw a golden toy hither and thither in the feast-hall , and at last it rolled away among the wine-casks till it lay at Sigmund 's feet . So the children followed it , and coming face to face with those lurkers , they fled back to the feast-hall . And Sigmund and his foster-son saw all hope was ended , for they heard the rising tumult as men ran to their weapons ; so they made ready to go forth and die in the hall . Then on came the battle around the twain , and but short is the tale to tell , for Sinfiotli slipped on the blood-stained floor and the shield wall encompassed Sigmund , and so they were both hoppled strait and fast .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The Goth-folk washed their hall of blood and got them to slumber , but</l>
     <l n="2">Siggeir lay long pondering what dire death he might bring on his foes .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Now at the first grey dawning Siggeir 's folk dight a pit and it had two chambers with a sundering stone in the midst . Then they brought the Volsung kindred and set them therein , one in each chamber , that they might abide death alone , and yet in hearing of one another 's woe . And over the top the thralls laid roofing turfs , but so lingering were their hands that eve drew on ere the task was finished . Then stole Signy forth in the dusk , and spake the thralls fair , and gave them gold that they might hold their peace of what she did . And when they gainsaid her nought she drew out something wrapped in wheat straw , and cast it down swiftly into the pit where Sinfiotli lay , and departed .</p>
   <p>Sinfiotli at first deemed it food , but after a space Sigmund heard him laugh aloud for joy , for within the wrappings lay the sword of the Branstock . And Sinfiotli cried out the joyous tidings to his foster-father , and tarried not to set the point to the stone that sundered them , and lo , the blade pierced through , and Sigmund grasped the point . Then sawed Sigmund and Sinfiotli together till they cleft the stone , and they hewed full hard at the roofing , till they cast the turfs aside , and their hearts were gladdened with the sight of the starry heaven .</p>
   <p>Forth they leapt , and no words were needed of whither they should wend , but they fell on King Siggeir 's night-watch and slew them sleeping , and made haste to find the store of winter faggots , wherewith they built a mighty bale about the hall of Siggeir . They set a torch to the bale , and Sigmund gat him to one hall door and Sinfiotli to the other , and now the Goth-folk awoke to their last of days .</p>
   <p>Then cried Siggeir to his thralls and offered them joyous life-days and plenteous wealth if they would give him life , deeming that they had fired the hall in hatred . But there came a great voice crying from the door , “ Nay , no toilers are we ; wealth is ours when we list , but now our hearts are set to avenge our kin ; now hath the murder seed sprung and borne its fruit ; now the death-doomed and buried work this deed ; now doom draweth nigh thee at the hand of Sigmund the Volsung , and Sinfiotli , Signy 's son . ”</p>
   <p>Then the voice cried again , “ Come ye forth , women of the Goths , and thou , O Signy , my sister , come forth to seek the boughs of the Branstock . ” So fled the white-faced women from the fire , and passed scatheless by Sinfiotli 's blade , but Signy came not at all . Then the earls of Siggeir strove to burst from the hall , but ever the two glaives at the doorways drove them back to the fire .</p>
   <p>And , lo , now came Signy in queenly raiment , and stood before Sinfiotli and said , “ O mightiest son , this is the hour of our parting , and fain am I of slumber and the end of my toil now I have seen this day . And the blither do I leave thee because thy days on earth shall be but few ; I charge thee make thy life glorious , and leave a goodly tale . ”</p>
   <p>She kissed him and turned to Sigmund , and her face in the dawn-light seemed to him fair and ruddy as in the days when they twain dwelt by the Branstock . And she said , “ My youth was happy , yet this hour is the crown of my life-days which draw nigh their ending . And now I charge thee , Sigmund , when thou sittest once more a mighty king beneath the boughs of the Branstock , that thou remember how I loved the Volsung name , and spared not to spend all that was mine for its blossoming . ” Then she kissed him and turned again , and the dawn brightened at her back , and the fire shone red before her , and so for the last time was Signy beheld by the eyes of men . Thereafter King Siggeir 's roof-tree bowed earthward , and the mighty walls crashed down , and so that dark murder-hall lay wasted , and its glory was swept away .</p>
   <p>How Sigmund cometh to the Land of the Volsungs again , and of the death of Sinfiotli his Son .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Now Sigmund the king bestirs him , and Sinfiotli , Sigmund 's son ,</l>
     <l n="2">And they gather a host together , and many a mighty one ;</l>
     <l n="3">Then they set the ships in the sea-flood and sail from the stranger 's shore ,</l>
     <l n="4">And the beaks of the golden dragons see the Volsungs ’ land once more ;</l>
     <l n="5">And men 's hearts are fulfilled of joyance ; and they cry , The sun shines now</l>
     <l n="6">With never a curse to hide it , and they shall reap that sow !</l>
     <l n="7">Then for many a day sits Sigmund ‘ neath the boughs of the Branstock green ,</l>
     <l n="8">With his earls and lords about him as the Volsung wont hath been .</l>
     <l n="9">And oft he thinketh on Signy and oft he nameth her name ,</l>
     <l n="10">And tells how she spent her joyance and her life-days and her fame</l>
     <l n="11">That the Volsung kin might blossom and bear the fruit of worth</l>
     <l n="12">For the hope of unborn people and the harvest of the earth .</l>
     <l n="13">And again he thinks of the word that he spake that other day ,</l>
     <l n="14">How he should abide there lonely when his kin was passed away ,</l>
     <l n="15">Their glory and sole avenger , their after-summer seed .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But far and wide went Sinfiotli through the earth , mowing the war swathe and wasting the land , and passing but little time in song and laughter in his father 's hall . So went his days in warfare and valour , and yet his end was not glorious , for he drank of the poisoned cup given him by the sister of a warrior he had rightly slain .</p>
   <p>None might come nigh Sigmund in his anguish as he lifted the head of his fallen foster-child , and then swiftly bare him from the hall . On he went through dark thicket and over wind-swept heath , past the foot-hills and the homes of the deer , till he came to a great rushing water , whereon was a white-sailed boat , manned by a mighty man , “ one-eyed and seeming ancient . ” This mighty one told Sigmund he had been bidden to waft a great king over the water , and bade him lay his burden on board , but when Sigmund would have followed he could see neither ship nor man .</p>
   <p>But Sigmund went back to his throne , and behaved himself as a king , listening to his people 's plaints , and dealing out justice .</p>
   <p>Of the last battle of King Sigmund , and the death of him .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Now there was a king of the Islands , whom the tale doth Eylimi call ,</l>

     <l n="6">To labour the Volsung garden , and the hand must be set to the plough :</l>
     <l n="7">So he sendeth an earl of the people to King Eylimi 's high-built hall ,</l>

     <l n="64">Then come they to Eylimi 's kingdom , and good welcome have they there ,</l>
     <l n="65">And when Sigmund looked on Hiordis , he deemed her wise and fair .</l>
     <l n="66">But her heart was exceeding fain when she saw the glorious king ,</l>
     <l n="67">And it told her of times that should be full many a noble thing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="68">So there is Sigmund wedded at a great and goodly feast ,</l>
     <l n="69">And day by day on Hiordis the joy of her heart increased ;</l>
     <l n="70">And her father joyed in Sigmund and his might and majesty ,</l>
     <l n="71">And dead in the heart of the Isle-king his ancient fear did lie .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="72">Yet , forsooth , had men looked seaward , they had seen the gathering cloud ,</l>
     <l n="73">And the little wind arising , that should one day pipe so loud .</l>
     <l n="74">For well may ye wot indeed that King Lyngi the Mighty is wroth ,</l>
     <l n="75">When he getteth the gifts and the answer , and that tale of the woman 's</l>
     <l n="76">troth :</l>
     <l n="77">And he saith he will have the gifts and the woman herself withal ,</l>
     <l n="78">Either for loving or hating , and that both those heads shall fall .</l>
     <l n="79">So now when Sigmund and Hiordis are wedded a month or more ,</l>
     <l n="80">And the Volsung bids men dight them to cross the sea-flood o'er ,</l>
     <l n="81">Lo , how there cometh the tidings of measureless mighty hosts</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="84">Sore boded the heart of the Isle-king of what the end should be .</l>
     <l n="85">But Sigmund long beheld him , and he said : “ Thou deem'st of me</l>
     <l n="86">That my coming hath brought thee evil ; but put aside such things ;</l>
     <l n="87">For long have I lived , and I know it , that the lives of mighty kings</l>
     <l n="88">Are not cast away , nor drifted like the down before the wind ;</l>

     <l n="90">Have been turned to wed King Lyngi or aught but the Volsung seed .</l>
     <l n="91">Come , go we forth to the battle , that shall be the latest deed</l>
     <l n="92">Of thee and me meseemeth : yea , whether thou live or die ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="94">And therewith he brake the peace-strings and drew the blade of bale ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="96">So men ride adown to the sea-strand , and the kings their hosts array</l>

     <l n="98">With King Eylimi 's shielded champions mid Lyngi 's hosts of war ,</l>

   <p>Then Elf asked of the two women where they would go , and they prayed that he would take them to his land , where they dwelt for long in all honour .</p>
   <p>But the old queen , the mother of Elf , was indeed a woman wise above many , and fain would she know why the less noble of the two was dressed the more richly and why the handmaid gave always wiser counsel than her mistress . So she bade her son to speak suddenly and to take them unawares .</p>
   <p>Then he asked the gold-clad one how she knew in the dark winter night that the dawn was near . She answered that ever in her youth she awoke at the dawn to follow her daily work , and always was she wont to drink of whey , and now , though the times were changed , she still woke athirst near the dawning .</p>
   <p>To Elf it seemed strange that a fair queen in her youth had need to arise to follow the plough in the dark of the winter morning , and turning to the handmaid he asked of her the same question . She replied that in her youth her father had given her the gold ring she still wore , and which had the magic power of growing cold as the hours neared daybreak , and such was her dawning sign .</p>
   <p>Then did Elf know of their exchange , and he told Hiordis that long had he loved her and felt pity for her sorrow , and that he would make her his wife . So that night she sat on the high-seat with the crown on her head , and dreamt of what had been and what was to be .</p>

   <p>In this land of the Helper and Elf , his son , dwelt Hiordis , and here her son , the last of the Volsungs , was born . The babe had eyes of such wondrous brightness that the folk shrank from him , while they rejoiced over his birth , but his mother spake to the babe as to one who might understand , and she told him of Sigmund and Volsung , of their wars and their troubles and their joys . Then she gave him to her maids to bear him to the kings of the land that they might rejoice with her .</p>

     <l n="30">Then Regin laughed , and answered : “ I doled out cunning to thee ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="40">So is Sigurd now with Regin , and he learns him many things ;</l>

     <l n="42">The smithying sword and war-coat ; the carving runes aright ;</l>
     <l n="43">The tongues of many countries , and soft speech for men 's delight ;</l>
     <l n="44">The dealing with the harp-strings , and the winding ways of song .</l>
     <l n="45">So wise of heart waxed Sigurd , and of body wondrous strong :</l>

   <p>One day did Regin tell Sigurd of deeds done in the past by kings both bold and wise , and the lad longed , too , to do the like , and his bright eyes glowed with desire .

   <p>This roused Sigurd 's wrath , for he would have nought said against those who had reared him , but Regin bade him ask for one of the horses of Gripir , and banished his anger by a song of the deeds of the Choosers of the Slain . Before the song was finished Sigurd went to King Elf and asked that he might have authority to seek a horse from King Gripir .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Then smiled King Elf , and answered : “ A long way wilt thou ride ,</l>

     <l n="4">The praise of many a people : so have thy way herein .</l>
     <l n="5">Forsooth no more may we hold thee than the hazel copse may hold</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Then sweetly Sigurd thanked them ; and through the night he lay</l>
     <l n="8">Mid dreams of many a matter till the dawn was on the way ;</l>
     <l n="9">Then he shook the sleep from off him , and that dwelling of Kings he left</l>
     <l n="10">And wended his ways unto Gripir . On a crag from the mountain reft</l>
     <l n="11">Was the house of the old King builded ; and a mighty house it was ,</l>
     <l n="12">Though few were the sons of men that over its threshold would pass :</l>
     <l n="13">But the wild ernes cried about it , and the vultures toward it flew ,</l>
     <l n="14">And the winds from the heart of the mountains searched every chamber</l>
     <l n="15">through ,</l>
     <l n="16">And about were meads wide-spreading ; and many a beast thereon ,</l>
     <l n="17">Yea some that are men-folk 's terror , their sport and pasture won .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="18">So into the hall went Sigurd ; and amidst was Gripir set</l>
     <l n="19">In a chair of the sea-beast 's tooth ; and his sweeping beard nigh met</l>
     <l n="20">The floor that was green as the ocean , and his gown was of mountain-gold ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="22">Now the first of the twain spake Gripir : “ Hail King with the eyen bright !</l>
     <l n="23">Nought needest thou show the token , for I know of thy life and thy light .</l>
     <l n="24">And no need to tell of thy message ; it was wafted here on the wind ,</l>
     <l n="25">That thou wouldst be coming today a horse in my meadow to find :</l>
     <l n="26">And strong must he be for the bearing of those deeds of thine that shall be .</l>

     <l n="28">Then again gat Sigurd outward , and adown the steep he ran</l>

     <l n="30">One-eyed and seeming ancient , there met him by the way :</l>
     <l n="31">And he spake : “ Thou hastest , Sigurd ; yet tarry till I say</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="34">“ Wouldst thou have red gold for thy tidings ? art thou Gripir 's horse-herd</l>
     <l n="35">then ?</l>
     <l n="36">Nay sure , for thy face is shining like the battle-eager men</l>
     <l n="37">My master Regin tells of : and I love thy cloud-grey gown ,</l>
     <l n="38">And thy visage gleams above it like a thing my dreams have known . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="39">“ Nay whiles have I heeded the horse-kind , ” then spake that elder of days ,</l>
     <l n="40">“ And sooth do the sages say , when the beasts of my breeding they praise .</l>
     <l n="41">There is one thereof in the meadow , and , wouldst thou cull him out ,</l>
     <l n="42">Thou shalt follow an elder 's counsel , who hath brought strange things about ,</l>

     <l n="44">So Sigurd said , “ I am ready ; and what is the deed to win ? ”</l>
     <l n="45">He said : “ We shall drive the horses adown to the water-side ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="47">Then the twain sped on together , and they drave the horses on</l>
     <l n="48">Till they came to a rushing river , a water wide and wan ;</l>
     <l n="49">And the white mews hovered o'er it ; but none might hear their cry</l>
     <l n="50">For the rush and the rattle of waters , as the downlong flood swept by .</l>
     <l n="51">So the whole herd took the river and strove the stream to stem ,</l>
     <l n="52">And many a brave steed was there ; but the flood o'ermastered them :</l>
     <l n="53">And some , it swept them down-ward , and some won back to bank ,</l>
     <l n="54">Some , caught by the net of the eddies , in the swirling hubbub sank ;</l>
     <l n="55">But one of all swam over , and they saw his mane of grey</l>
     <l n="56">Toss over the flowery meadows , a bright thing far away :</l>
     <l n="57">Wide then he wheeled about them , then took the stream again</l>
     <l n="58">And with the waves ’ white horses mingled his cloudy mane .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="59">Then spake the elder of days : “ Hearken now , Sigurd , and hear ;</l>

     <l n="61">And this horse is a gift of my giving :— heed nought where thou mayst ride :</l>
     <l n="62">For I have seen thy fathers in a shining house abide ,</l>
     <l n="63">And on earth they thought of its threshold , and the gifts I had to give ;</l>
     <l n="64">Nor prayed for a little longer , and a little longer to live . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="65">Then forth he strode to the mountains , and fain was Sigurd now .</l>

     <l n="69">So Sigurd turned to the river and stood by the wave-wet strand ,</l>

     <l n="73">The tireless horse of Odin : cloud-grey he was of hue ,</l>
     <l n="74">And it seemed as Sigurd backed him that Sigmund 's son he knew ,</l>
     <l n="75">So glad he went beneath him . Then the youngling 's song arose</l>
     <l n="76">As he brushed through the noontide blossoms of Gripir 's mighty close ,</l>
     <l n="77">Then he singeth the song of Greyfell , the horse that Odin gave ,</l>

     <l n="95">Then Sigurd answered and said : “ Nought such do I look to be .</l>

   <p>So Regin welded together the shards of Sigmund 's sword , and wrought the Wrath of Sigurd , whose hilts were great and along whose edge ran a living flame so that men thought it like sunlight and lightning mingled .

   <p>And Sigurd told Gripir that he indeed was wise above all men , but for himself had the Wrath been fashioned , and he was ready to ride to the Glittering Heath .

     <l n="25">How Sigurd took to him the Treasure of the Elf Andvari .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>So Sigurd ate of the heart of Fafnir , and as he ate the longing to be gone to mighty deeds grew great , and he leapt on Greyfell and sought the home of the Dweller amid the Gold on the edge of the heath . He strode through the doorway , and before him lay golden armour , golden coins , and golden sands from rivers that none but the Dwarfs could mine . But more wonderful than all other treasures were the Helm of Aweing , and the Hauberk all of gold , while on top of the midmost heap , gleaming like the brightest star in the sky , lay the ring of Andvari .</p>
   <p>Sigurd put on the helm and the hauberk , and dragged out gold wherewith he loaded Greyfell till the cloud-grey horse shone , while the eagles ever bade him bring forth the treasure , and let the gold shine in the open . And as the stars paled and the dawn grew clearer , Sigurd and Greyfell passed swiftly and lightly towards the west .</p>
   <p>How Sigurd awoke Brynhild upon Hindfell .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">By long roads rideth Sigurd amidst that world of stone ,</l>
     <l n="2">And somewhat south he turneth ; for he would not be alone ,</l>
     <l n="3">But longs for the dwellings of man-folk , and the kingly people 's speech ,</l>
     <l n="4">And the days of the glee and the joyance , where men laugh each to each .</l>
     <l n="5">But still the desert endureth , and afar must Greyfell fare</l>
     <l n="6">From the wrack of the Glittering Heath , and Fafnir 's golden lair .</l>
     <l n="7">Long Sigurd rideth the waste , when , lo , on a morning of day</l>
     <l n="8">From out of the tangled crag-walls , amidst the cloud-land grey</l>
     <l n="9">Comes up a mighty mountain , and it is as though there burns</l>
     <l n="10">A torch amidst of its cloud-wreath ; so thither Sigurd turns ,</l>
     <l n="11">For he deems indeed from its topmost to look on the best of the earth ;</l>
     <l n="12">And Greyfell neigheth beneath him , and his heart is full of mirth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">Night falls , but yet rides Sigurd , and hath no thought of rest ,</l>
     <l n="14">For he longs to climb that rock-world and behold the earth at its best ;</l>
     <l n="15">But now mid the maze of the foot-hills he seeth the light no more ,</l>
     <l n="16">And the stars are lovely and gleaming on the lightless heavenly floor .</l>
     <l n="17">So up and up he wendeth till the night is wearing thin ;</l>
     <l n="18">And he rideth a rift of the mountain , and all is dark therein ,</l>
     <l n="19">Till the stars are dimmed by dawning and the wakening world is cold ;</l>
     <l n="20">Then afar in the upper rock-wall a breach doth he behold ,</l>
     <l n="21">And a flood of light poured inward the doubtful dawning blinds :</l>
     <l n="22">So swift he rideth thither and the mouth of the breach he finds ,</l>
     <l n="23">And sitteth awhile on Greyfell on the marvellous thing to gaze :</l>
     <l n="24">For lo , the side of Hindfell enwrapped by the fervent blaze ,</l>
     <l n="25">And nought ‘ twixt earth and heaven save a world of flickering flame ,</l>
     <l n="26">And a hurrying shifting tangle , where the dark rents went and came .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="27">Great groweth the heart of Sigurd with uttermost desire ,</l>

     <l n="29">Till he draweth rein in the dawning on the face of Hindfell 's steep :</l>
     <l n="30">But who shall heed the dawning where the tongues of that wildfire leap ?</l>
     <l n="31">For they weave a wavering wall , that driveth over the heaven</l>
     <l n="32">The wind that is born within it ; nor ever aside is it driven</l>
     <l n="33">By the mightiest wind of the waste , and the rain-flood amidst it is nought ;</l>
     <l n="34">And no wayfarer 's door and no window the hand of its builder hath wrought .</l>
     <l n="35">But thereon is the Volsung smiling as its breath uplifteth his hair ,</l>
     <l n="36">And his eyes shine bright with its image , and his mail gleams white and</l>
     <l n="37">fair ,</l>
     <l n="38">And his war-helm pictures the heavens and the waning stars behind :</l>
     <l n="39">But his neck is Greyfell stretching to snuff at the flame-wall blind ,</l>
     <l n="40">And his cloudy flank upheaveth , and tinkleth the knitted mail ,</l>
     <l n="41">And the gold of the uttermost waters is waxen wan and pale .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="42">Now Sigurd turns in his saddle , and the hilt of the Wrath he shifts ,</l>

     <l n="45">But the white wall wavers before him and the flame-flood rusheth apart ,</l>
     <l n="46">And high o'er his head it riseth , and wide and wild is its roar</l>
     <l n="47">As it beareth the mighty tidings to the very heavenly floor :</l>

     <l n="49">When it bows with the wind of the summer and the hid spears draw anigh .</l>
     <l n="50">The white flame licks his raiment and sweeps through Greyfell 's mane ,</l>
     <l n="51">And bathes both hands of Sigurd and the hilts of Fafnir 's bane ,</l>
     <l n="52">And winds about his war-helm and mingles with his hair ,</l>
     <l n="53">But nought his raiment dusketh or dims his glittering gear ;</l>
     <l n="54">Then it fails and fades and darkens till all seems left behind ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="56">But forth a little further and a little further on</l>

     <l n="59">And a ring of pale slaked ashes on the side of Hindfell lies ;</l>
     <l n="60">And the world of the waste is beyond it ; and all is hushed and grey ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="62">Then Sigurd looked before him and a Shield-burg there he saw ,</l>

     <l n="65">And the blazonings of their glory were done upon them bright .</l>
     <l n="66">As of dear things wrought for the war-lords new come to Odin 's hall .</l>
     <l n="67">Piled high aloft to the heavens uprose that battle-wall ,</l>
     <l n="68">And far o'er the topmost shield-rim for a banner of fame there hung</l>
     <l n="69">A glorious golden buckler ; and against the staff it rung</l>

     <l n="72">But the Wrath cried out in answer as Sigurd leapt adown</l>

     <l n="75">As against its gleaming silence the eager Sigurd gleamed :</l>
     <l n="76">He draweth not sword from scabbard , as the wall he wendeth around ,</l>

     <l n="79">And no warder the way withstandeth , and no earls by the threshold abide .</l>
     <l n="80">So he stands awhile and marvels ; then the baleful light of the Wrath</l>
     <l n="81">Gleams bare in his ready hand as he wendeth the inward path :</l>
     <l n="82">For he doubteth some guile of the Gods , or perchance some Dwarf-king 's</l>

     <l n="84">Or a mock of the Giant people that shall fade in the morning air :</l>
     <l n="85">But he getteth him in and gazeth ; and a wall doth he behold ,</l>

     <l n="90">Piled high as the rims of the Shield-burg above the level ground ;</l>
     <l n="91">And there , on that mound of the Giants , o'er the wilderness forlorn ,</l>

     <l n="93">So there was Sigurd alone ; and he went from the shielded door ,</l>

     <l n="103">So thereby he stoopeth and kneeleth , for he deems it were good indeed</l>

     <l n="107">Then he saith he will look on the face , if it bear him love or hate ,</l>
     <l n="108">Or the bonds for his life 's constraining , or the sundering doom of fate .</l>
     <l n="109">So he draweth the helm from the head , and , lo , the brow snow-white ,</l>

     <l n="120">Bright burnt the pale blue edges for the sunrise drew anear ,</l>

   <p>Then the maiden told him that she had been the handmaid of the All-father , but that she grew too proud , and Odin had sent her to Hindfell , where the sleep thorn pierced her that she might sleep till she found the fearless heart she would wed .

   <p>But many though they were they were not enough for him , who prayed her to speak with him more of Wisdom .</p>
   <p>So together they sat on the side of Hindfell and talked of all that is and can be , and then together they climbed the mountain , till beneath them they saw the kingdoms of the earth stretching far away , and Brynhild bade him look down on her home , saying :</p>

    <head>BRYNHILD .</head>
     <l n="1">Of Sigurd 's riding to the Niblungs .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Now Brynhild and Sigurd left Hindfell , and Brynhild went to dwell in her sister 's house , but Sigurd abode not long in the land of Lymdale , for his love urged him to great adventures wherein he might win glory befitting the man who should wed so noble a woman as Brynhild .</p>
   <p>So it befell one day in summer that he dight himself in the Helm of Aweing and the Mail-coat all of gold , and girded the Wrath to his side to ride forth again . And on his saddle he bound the red rings of Fafnir 's Treasure .</p>
   <p>Then he kissed the ancient King Heimir , and hailed the folk of the land who came to give him god-speed .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">And he gathered the reins together , and set his face to the road ,</l>
     <l n="2">And the glad steed neighed beneath him as they fared from the King 's abode .</l>
     <l n="3">And out past the dewy closes ; but the shouts went up to the sky ,</l>
     <l n="4">Though some for very sorrow forbore the farewell cry ,</l>
     <l n="5">Nor was any man but heavy that the godlike guest should go ;</l>
     <l n="6">And they craved for that glad heart guileless , and that face without a foe .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">But forth by dale and lealand doth the Son of Sigmund wend ,</l>
     <l n="8">Till far away lies Lymdale and the folk of the forest 's end ;</l>
     <l n="9">And he rides a heath unpeopled and holds the westward way ,</l>
     <l n="10">Till a long way off before him come up the mountains grey ;</l>
     <l n="11">Grey , huge beyond all telling , and the host of the heaped clouds ,</l>
     <l n="12">The black and the white together , on that rock-wall 's coping crowds .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">So up and down he rideth , till at even of the day</l>
     <l n="14">A hill 's brow he o'ertoppeth that had hid the mountains grey ;</l>
     <l n="15">Huge , blacker they showed than aforetime , white hung the cloud-flecks there ,</l>
     <l n="16">But red was the cloudy crown , for the sun was sinking fair :</l>
     <l n="17">A wide plain lay beneath him , and a river through it wound</l>
     <l n="18">Betwixt the lea and the acres , and the misty orchard ground ;</l>
     <l n="19">But forth from the feet of the mountains a ridged hill there ran</l>
     <l n="20">That upreared at its hithermost ending a builded burg of man ;</l>
     <l n="21">And Sigurd deemed in his heart as he looked on the burg from afar ,</l>
     <l n="22">That the high Gods scarce might win it , if thereon they fell with war ;</l>
     <l n="23">So many and great were the walls , so bore the towers on high</l>
     <l n="24">The threat of guarded battle , and the tale of victory .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">For as waves on the iron river of the days whereof nothing is told</l>
     <l n="26">Stood up the many towers , so stark and sharp and cold ;</l>
     <l n="27">But dark-red and worn and ancient as the midmost mountain-sides</l>
     <l n="28">Is the wall that goeth about them ; and its mighty compass hides</l>
     <l n="29">Full many a dwelling of man whence the reek now goeth aloft ,</l>
     <l n="30">And the voice of the house-abiders , the sharp sounds blent with the soft :</l>
     <l n="31">But one house in the midst is unhidden and high up o'er the wall it goes ;</l>
     <l n="32">Aloft in the wind of the mountains its golden roof-ridge glows ,</l>
     <l n="33">And down mid its buttressed feet is the wind 's voice never still ;</l>
     <l n="34">And the day and the night pass o'er it and it changes to their will ,</l>
     <l n="35">And whiles is it glassy and dark , and whiles is it white and dead ,</l>
     <l n="36">And whiles is it grey as the sea-mead , and whiles is it angry red ;</l>
     <l n="37">And it shimmers under the sunshine and grows black to the threat of the</l>
     <l n="38">storm ,</l>
     <l n="39">And dusk its gold roof glimmers when the rain-clouds over it swarm ,</l>
     <l n="40">And bright in the first of the morning its flame doth it uplift ,</l>
     <l n="41">When the light clouds rend before it and along its furrows drift .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Then Sigurd 's heart was glad as he beheld the city , and after a while he came to a gate-way set in the northern wall , and the gate was long and dark as a sea-cave . But no man stayed him as he rode through the dusk to the inner court-yard , and saw the lofty roof of the hall before him , cold now and grey like a very cloud , for the sun was fully set . But in the towers watch-men were calling one to another . To them he cried , saying :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Ho , men of this mighty burg , to what folk of the world am I come ?</l>
     <l n="2">And who is the King of battles who dwells in this lordly home ?</l>
     <l n="3">Or perchance are ye of the Elf-kin ? are ye guest-fain , kind at the board ,</l>
     <l n="4">Or murder-churls and destroyers to gain and die by the sword ? ”</l>
     <l n="5">Then the spears in the forecourt glittered and the swords shone over the</l>
     <l n="6">wall ,</l>
     <l n="7">But the song of smitten harp-strings came faint from the cloudy hall .</l>
     <l n="8">And he hearkened a voice and a crying : “ The house of Giuki the King ,</l>
     <l n="9">And the Burg of the Niblung people and the heart of their warfaring . ”</l>
     <l n="10">There were many men about him , and the wind in the wall-nook sang ,</l>
     <l n="11">And the spears of the Niblungs glittered , and the swords in the forecourt</l>
     <l n="12">rang .</l>
     <l n="13">But they looked on his face in the even , and they hushed their voices and</l>
     <l n="14">gazed ,</l>
     <l n="15">For fear and great desire the hearts of men amazed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="16">Now cometh an earl to King Giuki as he sits in godlike wise</l>
     <l n="17">With his sons , the Kings of battle , and his wife of the glittering eyes ,</l>
     <l n="18">And the King cries out at his coming to tell why the watch-horns blew ;</l>
     <l n="19">But the earl saith : “ Lord of the people , choose now what thou wilt do ;</l>
     <l n="20">For here is a strange new-comer , and he saith , to thee alone</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="23">Then uprose the King of the Niblungs , and was clad in purple and pall ,</l>
     <l n="24">And his sheathed sword lay in his hand , as he gat him adown the hall ,</l>
     <l n="25">And abroad through the Niblung doorway ; and a mighty man he was ,</l>
     <l n="26">And wise and ancient of days : so there by the earls doth he pass ,</l>
     <l n="27">And beholdeth the King on the war-steed and looketh up in his face :</l>
     <l n="28">But Sigurd smileth upon him in the Niblungs ’ fenced place ,</l>
     <l n="29">As the King saith : “ Gold-bestrider , who into our garth wouldst ride ,</l>

     <l n="32">And the heart of a war-fain people from the weary road are ye come ;</l>

     <l n="37">So I bid thee abide in my house , and when many days are o'er ,</l>
     <l n="38">Thou shalt tell us at last of thine errand , if thou bear us peace or war . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="39">Then all rejoiced at his word till the swords on the bucklers rang ,</l>
     <l n="40">And adown from the red-gold Treasure the Son of Sigmund sprang ,</l>
     <l n="41">And he took the hand of Giuki , and kissed him soft and sweet ,</l>

     <l n="62">And learn of thine ancient wisdom till forth to the field we ride . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Glad then was the murmur of folk , for the tidings had gone forth , And its breath had been borne to the Niblungs , and the tale of Sigurd 's worth .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">But the King said : “ Welcome , Sigurd , full fair of deed and of word !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Then he took his hand in his hand , and into the hall they passed ,</l>

     <l n="9">And they rang from the glassy pillars , and the Gods on the hangings stirred ,</l>
     <l n="10">And afar the clustering eagles on the golden roof-ridge heard ,</l>
     <l n="11">And cried out on the Sword of the Branstock as they cried in the other days :</l>
     <l n="12">Then the harps rang out in the hall , and men sang in Sigurd 's praise</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">But now on the dais he meeteth the kin of Giuki the wise :</l>

     <l n="15">Lo , here is the goodly Gunnar with the face of a king 's desire ;</l>

     <l n="20">And all these looked long on Sigurd and their hearts upon him smiled .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Then all gave him greeting as one who should be their fellow in mighty deeds , and the fair-armed Gudrun , Giuki 's daughter , brought him a cup of welcome , and that night the Niblungs feasted in gladness of heart .</p>
   <p>Of Sigurd 's warfaring in the company of the Niblungs , and of his great fame and glory .</p>
   <p>So Sigurd abode with the Niblungs all through summer and harvest time till with the stark midwinter came tidings of war . Then the earls of Giuki donned dusky hauberks and led forth their bands from the fortress , and the fair face and golden gear of Sigurd shone among those swart-haired warriors .</p>
   <p>They fell on the cities of the plains , but none might resist the valour of Sigurd , and the Niblungs turned in triumph from the war , bringing rich spoil . So all that winter Sigurd fared to war with them and grew greater in glory and more beloved of all men , but ever the thoughts of his heart turned to Lymdale and to Brynhild who awaited him there .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Now sheathed is the Wrath of Sigurd ; for as wax withstands the flame ,</l>

     <l n="9">That the sheaf shall be for the plougher , and the loaf for him that sowed ,</l>

     <l n="46">Of the Cup of evil drink that Grimhild the Wise-wife gave to Sigurd .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Now Gudrun the daughter of Giuki beheld Sigurd 's glory and knew the kindness of his heart , and set her love on him , not knowing that all his thoughts were given to Brynhild . So Sigurd , seeing her sad and in no wise guessing the cause of her grief , strove to comfort her with kindly words , but her mood was still unchanged .</p>
   <p>Then Grimhild the Queen , who was a witch-wife and a woman of crafty mind , marked the love of Gudrun for Sigurd , and marked moreover how his power and honour in the land would soon be greater than that of her own sons . Therefore she cast about for some shift that might bind Sigurd to serve with the Niblungs all his life-days .</p>
   <p>Now it befell one night that Sigurd had returned from warring and sat on the high-seat to sup with the Niblung kings . His heart was merry with victory and ever he thought of Hindfell and of Lymdale and the love of Brynhild . The people waxed joyful , and the hangings whereon glowed figures of the gods were stirred with their song and shouting till Giuki called on Sigurd to take the harp and sing of deeds agone . Then all men hearkened , hushed and happy , while Sigurd struck the strings and sang of his mighty kin , of Volsung , of Signy , and of Sigmund , their deeds and noble deaths . At last the tale was ended and he fell silent thinking still of Brynhild .</p>
   <p>Now came Grimhild bearing him a cup of wine and speaking fair words of praise , but in the wine she had mingled a fatal witch-drink . So she stood by Sigurd and said :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ There is none of the kings of kingdoms that may match thy goodlihead :</l>
     <l n="2">Lo now , thou hast sung of thy fathers ; but men shall sing of thee ,</l>
     <l n="3">And therewith shall our house be remembered , and great shall our glory be .</l>
     <l n="4">I beseech thee hearken a little to a faithful word of mine ,</l>
     <l n="5">When thou of this cup hast drunken ; for my love is blent with the wine . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">He laughed and took the cup : But therein with the blood of the earth</l>
     <l n="7">Earth 's hidden might was mingled , and deeds of the cold sea 's birth ,</l>
     <l n="8">And things that the high Gods turn from , and a tangle of strange love ,</l>
     <l n="9">Deep guile and strong compelling , that whoso drank thereof</l>
     <l n="10">Should remember not his longing , should cast his love away ,</l>
     <l n="11">Remembering dead desire but as night remembereth day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="12">So Sigurd looked on the horn , and he saw how fair it was scored</l>
     <l n="13">With the cunning of the Dwarf-kind and the masters of the sword ;</l>
     <l n="14">And he drank and smiled on Grimhild above the beaker 's rim ,</l>
     <l n="15">And she looked and laughed at his laughter ; and the soul was changed in him .</l>
     <l n="16">Men gazed and their hearts sank in them , and they knew not why it was ,</l>
     <l n="17">Why the fair-lit hall was darkling , nor what had come to pass :</l>
     <l n="18">For they saw the sorrow of Sigurd , who had seen but his deeds erewhile ,</l>
     <l n="19">And the face of the mighty darkened , who had known but the light of its</l>
     <l n="20">smile .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="21">But Grimhild looked and was merry : and she deemed her life was great ,</l>
     <l n="22">And her hand a wonder of wonders to withstand the deeds of Fate :</l>
     <l n="23">For she saw by the face of Sigurd and the token of his eyes</l>
     <l n="24">That her will had abased the valiant , and filled the faithful with lies .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">But the heart was changed in Sigurd ; as though it ne'er had been</l>
     <l n="26">His love of Brynhild perished as he gazed on the Niblung Queen :</l>
     <l n="27">Brynhild 's beloved body was e'en as a wasted hearth ,</l>
     <l n="28">No more for bale or blessing , for plenty or for dearth .</l>
     <l n="29">— O ye that shall look hereafter , when the day of Sigurd is done ,</l>
     <l n="30">And the last of his deeds is accomplished , and his eyes are shut in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="31">When ye look and long for Sigurd , and the image of Sigurd behold ,</l>
     <l n="32">And his white sword still as the moon , and his strong hand heavy and cold ,</l>
     <l n="33">Then perchance shall ye think of this even , then perchance shall ye wonder</l>
     <l n="34">and cry ,</l>
     <l n="35">“ Twice over , King , are we smitten , and twice have we seen thee die . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="36">Men say that a little after the evil of that night</l>
     <l n="37">All waste is the burg of Brynhild , and there springeth a marvellous light</l>
     <l n="38">On the desert hard by Lymdale , and few men know for why ;</l>
     <l n="39">But there are , who say that a wildfire thence roareth up to the sky</l>
     <l n="40">Round a glorious golden dwelling , wherein there sitteth a Queen</l>
     <l n="41">In remembrance of the wakening , and the slumber that hath been ;</l>
     <l n="42">Wherein a Maid there sitteth , who knows not hope nor rest</l>
     <l n="43">For remembrance of the Mighty , and the Best come forth from the Best .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Now after Sigurd took the witch-drink came a great hush upon the feast-hall for a space . But Grimhild was fain of that hour and cried to the scalds for music , and they hastened to strike the harp , but no joy mingled with the sounds and no man was moved to singing .</p>
   <p>No word spake Sigurd till the feast was over ; then he strode out alone from the hall and the folk fell back before him . So he took a steed and all that night he rode alone in the deedless dark , and all the morrow , very heavy at heart yet knowing no cause for grief , and remembering all things save Brynhild .</p>
   <p>At last he came again at sunset to the Niblung gates , and there came forth Giuki and Grimhild and the Niblung brethren with fair words of greeting , but in the doorway Gudrun stood and wept . So Sigurd entered with them , yet he knew that a flood of sorrow had come on his life-days and that no more might he feel the joy he had known aforetime in the Niblung hall . Howbeit , when he looked on the people and saw them in fear at his trouble , the kindness of his heart was kindled , and thrusting the heavy sorrow aside , he lifted his head and spake wise words of good cheer so that the folk looking on him were comforted .</p>
   <p>Of the Wedding of Sigurd the Volsung .</p>
   <p>But Gudrun knew Sigurd 's heart and was sorrowful because of his grief and her great love for him , and when Grimhild bade her carry him wine , she arose and took the cup but could find no word to speak for anguish . And Sigurd looking on her face saw there a kindness and a sorrow like his own , and seeing it he knew that she loved him . Then pity and love for her rose in his heart and comforted him , and he took the cup from her and spake , saying :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Here are glad men about us , and a joyous folk of war ,</l>

     <l n="4">But we twain alone are woeful , as sad folk sitting apart .</l>
     <l n="5">Ah , if I thy soul might gladden ! if thy lips might give me peace !</l>

   <p>So they twain went hand in hand to stand before Giuki and Grimhild and the swart-haired Niblung brethren , and all these were glad-hearted when they marked their joy and goodlihead .

Thereto Giuki answered glad-hearted , “ Hail , Sigurd , son of mine eld ! ” and called upon Grimhild the Queen to bless him .</p>
   <p>Thus was Sigurd troth-plight to the white-armed Gudrun , and all men were fain of their love and spake nought but praise of him .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>So ten days wore over , and on the morrow-morn the folk were all astir in the Niblung house , till the watchers on the towers cried to them tidings of a goodly company drawing nigh upon the road . Then the Niblungs got them to horse in glittering-gay raiment and went forth to meet the people of Brynhild .</p>
   <p>First rode bands of maidens arrayed in fine linen and blue-broidered cloaks , and after them came a golden wain with horses of snowy white and bench-cloths of blue , and therein sat Brynhild alone , clad in swan-white raiment and crowned with gold . Then they hailed her sweet and goodly , and so she entered the darksome gate-way and came within the Niblung Burg .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">So fair in the sun of the forecourt doth Brynhild 's wain shine bright ,</l>
     <l n="2">And the huge hall riseth before her , and the ernes cry out from its height ,</l>
     <l n="3">And there by the door of the Niblungs she sees huge warriors stand ,</l>
     <l n="4">Dark-clad , by the shoulders greater than the best of any land ,</l>
     <l n="5">And she knoweth the chiefs of the Niblungs , the dreaded dukes of war :</l>

     <l n="8">And she knoweth the King of the Niblungs and the man she came to find :</l>
     <l n="9">Then nought she lingered nor loitered , but stepped to the earth adown</l>
     <l n="10">With right-hand reached to the War-God , the wearer of the crown ;</l>
     <l n="11">And she said :</l>

     <l n="6">She heard the name , and she changed not , but her feet went forth as he led ,</l>

     <l n="10">He had heard no sound so mighty as the shout that shook the wall</l>
     <l n="11">When Brynhild 's feet unhearkened first trod the Niblung hall .</l>
     <l n="12">No whit the clamour stirred her ; but her godlike eyes she raised</l>
     <l n="13">And betwixt the hedge of the earl-folk on the golden high-seat gazed ,</l>

   </lg>
   <p>So now must Sigurd and Brynhild abide together in the Burg of the Niblungs , yet each must bear the burden of sorrow alone . Brynhild held close converse with Gudrun , and behaved humbly towards her lest strife should arise between them . But Gudrun , filled with pride that she was the wife of so great a man as Sigurd , deemed it a little matter that all others should give her honour , and knowing how Sigurd had ridden the fire , she cherished great scorn of Gunnar and Brynhild in her heart , and her pride waxed daily greater .</p>
   <p>Of the heart-wise Hogni men tell how he grew wiser day by day and more learned in the craft of his mother Grimhild .</p>
   <p>As for Gunnar , he lived with Brynhild in great honour and praise from all men , but the thought of how Sigurd had ridden the fire in his semblance lay heavy upon him . He brooded thereon in bitterness and envy , and the lie shadowed his life-days so that he had but small joy in his wife .</p>
   <p>And Grimhild , marking his heavy mood , wrought upon him with cunning words and he gave ear to her . For ever she spake of kings ’ supplanters who bear away the praise from their lords after great deeds are done , and often her talk was of the mighty power that he holdeth who knoweth the shame of a king . So Gunnar hearkened and ill thoughts grew within him .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">But fair-faced , calm as a God who hath none to call his foes ,</l>
     <l n="2">Betwixt the Kings and the people the golden Sigurd goes ;</l>
     <l n="3">No knowledge of man he lacketh , and the lore he gained of old</l>
     <l n="4">From the ancient heart of the Serpent and the Wallower on the Gold</l>
     <l n="5">Springs fresh in the soul of Sigurd ; the heart of Hogni he sees ,</l>
     <l n="6">And the heart of his brother Gunnar , and he grieveth sore for these .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">It was most in these latter days that his fame went far abroad ,</l>
     <l n="8">The helper , the overcomer , the righteous sundering sword ;</l>
     <l n="9">The loveliest King of the King-folk , the man of sweetest speech ,</l>
     <l n="10">Whose ear is dull to no man that his helping shall beseech ;</l>
     <l n="11">The eye-bright seer of all things , that wasteth every wrong ,</l>
     <l n="12">The straightener of the crooked , the hammer of the strong :</l>
     <l n="13">Lo , such was the Son of Sigmund in the days whereof I tell ,</l>
     <l n="14">The dread of the doom and the battle ; and all children loved him well .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Now Gudrun 's scorn of Brynhild waxed greater as she thought on the knowledge that she held , and it needed but a little that she should speak out the whole tale .</p>
   <p>Such was her mind when it befell her to go with Brynhild to bathe in the Niblung river . There it chanced that they fell to talk of their husbands , and Gudrun named Sigurd the best of the world . Thereat Brynhild , stung by her love for Sigurd and the memory of his broken troth ,— for so she deemed it ,— cried out , saying : “ Thy lord is but Gunnar 's serving man to do his bidding , but my mate is the King of King-folk , who rode the Wavering Fire and hath dared very death to win me . ”</p>
   <p>Then Gudrun held out her hand and a golden gleam shone on her finger , at the sight whereof Brynhild waxed wan as a dead woman . “ Lo , ” said Gudrun , “ I had Andvari 's ring of Sigurd , and indeed thou sayest truly , that he did Gunnar 's bidding , for he took the King 's semblance and hid his own shape in Gunnar 's . Thus he wooed the bride for Gunnar and for Gunnar rode the fire , and now by this token mayest thou know whether thy husband is truly the best of Kings . ” And Brynhild spake no word in answer , but clad herself in haste and fled from the river , and Gudrun followed her in triumph of heart .</p>
   <p>Yet as the day wore on she repented of her words and feared the deeds that Brynhild might do , and at even she sought her alone and craved pardon . Then spake Brynhild the Queen : “ I repent me of my bitter words this day , yet one thing I beseech thee ,— do thou say that thou hadst the ring of Gunnar and not of Sigurd , lest I be shamed before all men . ” “ What ? ” said Gudrun ; “ hast thou heard that the wives of the Niblungs lie ? Nay , Sigurd it was who set this ring on my finger and therewith he told me the shame of my brother Gunnar ,— how his glory was turned to a scoff . ”</p>
   <p>And Brynhild seeing that the tale of the deceiving wrought against her might not be hidden , lifted her voice and cursed the house of the Niblungs wherein she had suffered such woe . So the queens parted in great wrath and bitterness .</p>
   <p>Of the exceeding great grief and mourning of Brynhild .</p>
   <p>Now on the morrow it was known that Brynhild was sick , nor would she reveal the cause to any . Then Gunnar besought her to be comforted and to show what ailed her , but for a long while he might win no word in answer . Thereat the evil thoughts that Grimhild had sown in his heart grew strong , and he cried in bitter anger : “ Lo , Brynhild , I deem thou art sick for love of my foe , the supplanter of Kings , he who hath shone like a serpent this long while past amidst the honour of our kin . ”</p>
   <p>Then at last was Brynhild moved to look on him , and she besought him , saying : “ Swear to me , Gunnar , that I may live , and say that thou gavest Andvari 's ring to Gudrun — thou , and not thy captain of war . ” Thereby Gunnar understood that all his falsehood was known to her , so that never again might they two have any joy together . He had no answering word , but turned from her and departed , for bitter shame was come on him and hatred of Sigurd burnt in his soul like fire .</p>
   <p>Then as evening drew on , boding of evil fell on Gudrun , and she sought her brothers that they might plead with Brynhild to pardon her and forget her bitter taunts .</p>
   <p>But Gunnar she found seated alone arrayed in his war-gear and on his knees lay his sword , neither would he hear any word of further pleading with Brynhild .</p>
   <p>Then sought she Hogni , and behold , he was in the like guise , and sat as one that waits for a foe . So she sped to Sigurd , but chill fear fell on her beholding him , for he was dight in the Helm of Aweing and his golden hauberk , and the Wrath lay on his knees , neither would he then speak to Brynhild .</p>
   <p>So that heavy night passed away and there was but little sleep in the abode of the Niblungs . And with the dawn Sigurd arose and sought Brynhild 's chamber where she lay as one dead . Like a pillar of light he stood in the sunshine and the Wrath rattled by his side . And Brynhild looked on him and said : “ Art thou come to behold me ? Thou — the mightiest and the worst of my betrayers . ” Then for very grief the breast of Sigurd heaved so that the rings of his byrny burst asunder and he cried : “ O live , Brynhild beloved ! For hereafter shalt thou know of the snare and the lie that entrapped us and the measureless grief of my soul . ” “ It is o'erlate , ” said Brynhild , “ for I may live no longer and the gods have forgotten the earth . ” And in such despair must he leave her .</p>
   <p>Of the slaying of Sigurd the Volsung .</p>
   <p>Then at high noon Brynhild sent for Gunnar and sought to whet him to the slaying of Sigurd , for to such hatred was her love turned .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ I look upon thee , ” said Brynhild , “ I know thy race and thy name ,</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Thou hast spoken the word , ” said Brynhild , “ if the word is enough , it is well . Let us eat and drink and be merry , that all men of our words may tell ! ”</p>
   <p>“ O all-wise woman , ” said Gunnar , “ what deed lieth under the tongue ? What day for the dearth of the people , when the seed of thy sowing hath sprung ? ”</p>

     <l n="26">Then Hogni laughed and answered : “ His feet on the threshold stand :</l>

     <l n="28">“ Ho , Guttorm , enter , and hearken to the counsel of the wise ! ”</l>
     <l n="29">Then in through the door strode Guttorm fair-clad in hunter 's guise ,</l>
     <l n="30">With no steel save his wood-knife girded ; but his war-fain eyes stared wild ,</l>
     <l n="31">As he spake : “ What words are ye hiding from the youngest Niblung child ?</l>
     <l n="32">What work is to win , my brethren , that ye sit in warrior 's weed ,</l>

     <l n="34">Then uprose Grimhild the wise-wife , and took the cup again ;</l>

     <l n="37">On the hidden lives of ocean , and never look on day ;</l>
     <l n="38">And the heart of the ravening wood-wolf and the hunger-blinded beast</l>
     <l n="39">And the spent slaked heart of the wild-fire the guileful cup increased :</l>
     <l n="40">But huge words of ancient evil about its rim were scored ,</l>
     <l n="41">The curse and the eyeless craving of the first that fashioned sword .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="42">So the cup in her hand was gleaming , as she turned unto Guttorm and spake :</l>

     <l n="46">Forth flashed the flame from his eyen , and he cried : “ Where then is the foe ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="48">“ Drink , son , ” she said , “ and be merry ! and I shall tell his name ,</l>

     <l n="50">He drinketh and craveth for battle , and his hand for a sword doth seek ,</l>

     <l n="52">They speak the name , and he hears not , and again he drinks of the cup</l>
     <l n="53">And knows not friend nor kindred , and the wrath in his heart wells up ,</l>
     <l n="54">That no God may bear unmingled , and he cries a wordless cry ,</l>

     <l n="56">Then Grimhild goes from the chamber , and bringeth his harness of war ,</l>

     <l n="58">And his heart is set on the murder , and now may he understand</l>
     <l n="59">What soul is dight for the slaying , and what quarry is for his hand .</l>
     <l n="60">For again they tell him of Sigurd , and the man he remembereth ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="62">Now dusk and dark draw over , and through the glimmering house</l>

     <l n="66">With his blue blade naked before them : the torches flare from the wall</l>
     <l n="67">And the woven God-folk waver , but the hush is deep in the hall ,</l>
     <l n="68">And those Niblung faces change not , though the slow moon slips from her</l>
     <l n="69">height</l>
     <l n="70">And earth is acold ere dawning , and new winds shake the night .</l>

     <l n="71">Now it was in the earliest dawn-dusk that Guttorm stirred in his place ,</l>

     <l n="73">And went forth from the hall and the high-seat ; but the Kings sat still in</l>
     <l n="74">their pride</l>
     <l n="75">And hearkened the clash of his going and heeded how it died .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="76">Slow , all alone goeth Guttorm to Sigurd 's chamber door ,</l>
     <l n="77">And all is open before him , and the white moon lies on the floor</l>
     <l n="78">And the bed where Sigurd lieth with Gudrun on his breast ,</l>
     <l n="79">And light comes her breath from her bosom in the joy of infinite rest .</l>
     <l n="80">Then Guttorm stands on the threshold , and his heart of the murder is fain ,</l>
     <l n="81">And he thinks of the deeds of Sigurd , and praiseth his greatness and gain ;</l>
     <l n="82">Bright blue is his blade in the moonlight — but lo , how Sigurd lies ,</l>
     <l n="83">As the carven dead that die not , with fair wide-open eyes ;</l>
     <l n="84">And their glory gleameth on Guttorm , and the hate in his heart is chilled ,</l>
     <l n="85">And he shrinketh aback from the threshold and knoweth not what he willed .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Thereon he turned him again to the hall , and the Kings beheld his unstained sword in the torch-light , but they cast him never a word .

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Now dieth moon and candle , and though the day be nigh</l>
     <l n="2">The roof of the hall fair-builded seems far aloof as the sky ,</l>

     <l n="4">Then the brethren hist and hearken , for a sound of feet they hear ,</l>
     <l n="5">And into the hall of the Niblungs a white thing cometh apace :</l>

     <l n="8">Still more they hear those footsteps light-falling on the ground ,</l>
     <l n="9">And the hearts of the Niblungs waver , and their pride is smitten acold ,</l>
     <l n="10">For they look on that latest comer , and Brynhild they behold :</l>
     <l n="11">But she sits by their side in silence , and heeds them nothing more</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">But Guttorm clashed in the cloisters and through the silence strode</l>

     <l n="28">Woe 's me ! how the house of the Niblungs by another cry was rent ,</l>

     <l n="30">From the breast of the mighty Sigurd : he heard it and understood ,</l>
     <l n="31">And rose up on the sword of Guttorm , and turned from the country of death ,</l>

     <l n="39">Then he sank aback on the sword , and down to his lips she bent</l>

     <l n="48">There was silence then in the chamber , as the dawn spread wide and grey ,</l>

     <l n="58">The cry and the calling spread , and shields clashed down from the wall ,</l>
     <l n="59">And swords in the chamber glittered , and men ran apace to the hall .</l>
     <l n="60">Nor knew what man to question , nor who had tidings to give ,</l>

     <l n="63">And the spears in the hall were tossing as the rye in the windy plain .</l>
     <l n="64">But they look aloft to the high-seat and they see the gleam of the gold :</l>

     <l n="4">May Earth , that ye bade remember , on the blood of Sigurd cry !</l>
     <l n="5">Be this land as waste as the troth-plight that the lips of fools have sworn !</l>
     <l n="6">May it rain through this broken hall-roof , and snow on the hearth forlorn !</l>
     <l n="7">And may no man draw anigh it to tell of the ruin and the wrack !</l>
