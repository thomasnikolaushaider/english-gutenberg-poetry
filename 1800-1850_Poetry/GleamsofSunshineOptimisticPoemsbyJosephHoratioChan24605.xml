     <l n="2">O Thou , who art the source of joy and light ,</l>
     <l n="3">The great Revealer of the will Divine ;</l>
     <l n="4">Thyself Divine , all nature owns Thy might ,</l>
     <l n="5">And bows in homage at a beck of Thine ,</l>
     <l n="6">Afford me light to guide my unskilled hand ,</l>
     <l n="7">And by Thy Spirit all my thoughts command .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">To Thy great name I dedicate my powers ,</l>
     <l n="9">Yielding to Thee what Thou with blood hast bought ,</l>
     <l n="10">Resolved that Thou shalt have my days and hours ,</l>
     <l n="11">And for Thy sake shall every work be wrought ;</l>
     <l n="12">O deign to use me , if it be Thy will ,</l>
     <l n="13">And my poor heart with love and gladness fill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="14">If this strange impulse which I feel within</l>
     <l n="15">To write this book proceeds , O Lord , from Thee ,</l>
     <l n="16">Let it not die , nor be defiled by sin ,</l>
     <l n="17">But let the work from self and sin be free ,</l>
     <l n="18">And prove a guide to home and bliss above ,</l>
     <l n="19">And help to fill this warring world with love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="20">The Master 's touch I know it sadly lacks ,</l>
     <l n="21">And may not please the nice artistic taste</l>
     <l n="22">Of some fine mind that naught but gold attracts ;</l>
     <l n="23">Some may not count these iron-filings waste ;</l>
     <l n="24">Like magnets , to which gold will not adhere ,</l>
     <l n="25">May they find ore in this to bless and cheer .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="26">In this plain pitcher , Lord , Thy blessing pour ,</l>
     <l n="27">That from it men their raging thirst may slake ,</l>
     <l n="28">And when exhausted is the scanty store ,</l>
     <l n="29">Then let the earthen vessel quickly break ;</l>
     <l n="30">Its end is gained if Thou art glorified ,</l>
     <l n="31">And men have learned to love the Christ who died .</l>

     <l n="32">As flowers drink in the solar rays and dew ,</l>

     <l n="34">So would I to Thy Spirit 's touch prove true ,</l>
     <l n="35">And render that return which seemeth meet ;</l>
     <l n="36">Come , dews of grace ! Great Sun , illume my heart !</l>

     <l n="44">The pushing Anglo-Saxon race ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Dear Canada , our native land ,</l>
     <l n="2">Our love for thee grows day by day ;</l>
     <l n="3">Our fathers left the olden strand ,</l>
     <l n="4">O'er sea and rapids made their way ,</l>
     <l n="5">And by their energy and skill</l>
     <l n="6">They laid thy firm foundation deep ,</l>
     <l n="7">And sowed the seed o'er vale and hill</l>
     <l n="8">Which we , their sons , are called to reap .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">The wilderness blooms as the rose ;</l>
     <l n="10">The old-time hardships are unknown ;</l>
     <l n="11">And wealth in streams of commerce flows</l>
     <l n="12">From sea to sea — a nation grown —</l>
     <l n="13">Still youthful , but with thews of steel</l>
     <l n="14">To throttle foes that may arise ;</l>
     <l n="15">Yet loving touch sore hearts to heal ,</l>
     <l n="16">And lift us nearer to the skies .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">We cannot boast as blue a sky</l>
     <l n="18">As smiles o'er many an Alpine plain ,</l>
     <l n="19">Nor are our mountain peaks as high</l>
     <l n="20">As theirs , yet we have other gain ;</l>
     <l n="21">Our hills are rich in yellow gold ,</l>
     <l n="22">Our plains are broad and fertile too ;</l>
     <l n="23">Our lakes and streams hold wealth untold ,</l>
     <l n="24">And grander forests never grew .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">Our sky is bright to healthy eyes ;</l>
     <l n="26">Pure ozone lades the air we breathe ;</l>
     <l n="27">Our climate we have learned to prize ;</l>
     <l n="28">Nor do we o'er our winters grieve ;</l>
     <l n="29">For nature throws her ermine robe</l>
     <l n="30">O'er purple hills and vales as well ;</l>
     <l n="31">No portion of this earthly globe</l>
     <l n="32">As gay as this , with sleigh and bell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">But soon the winter wears away ,</l>
     <l n="34">And plants long sheltered now are seen ,</l>
     <l n="35">And April showers and smiling May</l>
     <l n="36">Soon clothe the earth in living green .</l>
     <l n="37">Monotony is thus unknown —</l>
     <l n="38">Each season is a glad surprise ,</l>
     <l n="39">In which God 's truth and love are shown ,</l>
     <l n="40">And hope within us never dies .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">Our sons , inured to noble toil ,</l>
     <l n="42">Grow strong in arm and broad in mind ;</l>
     <l n="43">Some stay at home to till the soil ,</l>
     <l n="44">Others in various callings find</l>

   <p>DUNBAR</p>
   <p>Up to Dunbar our Cromwell went , Not to invade was his intent ; But they who first King Charles sold Now turn their backs on friends of old , And principles they then held dear Were sacrificed for self , I fear . Another Stuart they receive , Who knew too well how to deceive ; The most perfidious of his race , Corrupt in life , and void of grace , The menial of the Papacy ; And yet content by oath to free Himself from Holy See 's control , And covenant to save his soul By the Scotch Presbyterian mode , As to the crown this paved the road . But Cromwell brooked not this control ; He wished man free to save his soul As conscience may to him dictate , Without subservience to the State . He saw also thro ’ the disguise Of one well versed in fraud and lies , And saw how England 's liberties Were threatened by this scheme of his . So up to Dunbar Cromwell went ; To break this compact his intent , Conserve the rights of Britons true To worship God in desk and pew As conscience may to them dictate , Without control of king , or state , Or Papal “ bull , ” or legate 's rod — Only accountable to God . On Sunday night he reached Dunbar . From darkened sky gleamed not a star ; The way he travelled o'er was drear , Made doubly so by Scotchmen 's fear . At his approach like sheep they fled , Made frantic by an awful dread Of red-hot irons , spear , and sword , Of breasts thrust thro ’ , and bodies gored , Which they were told would be their lot When Cromwell came . So from each cot They bore away what pleased them best , And to the flames consigned the rest . But now Dunbar is reached ; yet he Finds himself in extremity ; Midst swamps and bogs unfit to tent , By Lammermoor from hillside rent , Leslie in front defiant stands A noble army he commands Of thousands two score seven , or more , Ready on Cromwell shot to pour . Behind the sea cut off retreat ; With such great odds can he compete ? The mountain sheep may safely tread The Lammermoor , but men may dread To cross this heath at any time ; Much more now , midst the rain and slime , Will Cromwell with the smaller score Dare to cross o'er to Dunbar shore ? Tho ’ shipped were half his guns and men The foe falls ere he turn again . With foresight keen , like one inspired , He saw the end ere Leslie fired . “ THE LORD , ” said he , as rapt he stands , “ HATH GIVEN THEM INTO OUR HANDS ! ” ‘ Tis the ninth month and second day , A wild , wet night , historians say . Quit you like men , and bravely stand ; Death 's wrestle now is close at hand ; Heed not the hoarse sea 's doleful moan , As on the cliffs its waves are thrown . Think not of life nor kindred dear — Who goes to war should nothing fear But God , whose eye-lids never sleep — His Israel He will safely keep . Oh , pray ! but keep your powder dry — Your part do , then on God rely . Stand to your arms the whole night thro ’ Or lie awake with arms in view . And you , ye Scots , your lights blow out , But stay not in your strong redoubt . ‘ Midst shocks of corn your shelter seek , And rest in sleep ; your foe is weak , Yet ere another night comes ‘ round In deeper slumber shall be found Full many of your stalwart host , And stilled for aye their every boast . In Cromwell 's camp all night was heard The voice of prayer in tones which stirred The tender hearts of “ Ironside ” men , As never can be told by pen . Ere shone the first faint streak of morn , The Scots beneath the shocks of corn , Stretched out full length in quiet sleep , Hear a loud blast , and upward leap To seize their arms and face the foe . Too late the warning ! or , too slow Their movements when the trump was heard , Yet rang along the lines the word Of battle-cry by Leslie sent , “ The Covenant ! The Covenant ! ” While high and strong was Cromwell 's boast , “ The Lord of Hosts ! The Lord of Hosts ! ” With master skill he struck the blow , And when shone out the crimson glow Of morning sun upon the sea , Brave Leslie 's men began to flee . “ They run ! Oh , I protest they run ! Let God arise ! Let God arise ! And scattered be His enemies ! ” Loud Cromwell cried . The work was done . Then rose from England 's host a cry Which rent the very heavens on high . Now halt they on the battle field And to the Lord their homage yield — And sing this song with hearts devout : “ O praise the Lord , ye nations all ! Laud Him all peoples on this ball ! His mercy toward us e'er is great ; His truth and grace for sinners wait , Let all the people shout ! ”</p>

    <head>SILVER TONES</head>
     <l n="1">A stately church by pious hands erected long ago ,</l>
     <l n="2">Was found to lack a vesper bell , by which the poor might know</l>
     <l n="3">The hour of prayer , the hour of mass , and who had lately died ,</l>
     <l n="4">The hour when gent and bonny lass , so timid at his side ,</l>
     <l n="5">Would stand before the surpliced priest , and twain would pledge</l>
     <l n="6">their troth ,</l>
     <l n="7">The hour in which the priest would vent on heretic his wrath .</l>
     <l n="8">The faithful then were called upon to bring from home and mine</l>
     <l n="9">The metal for the holy bell , which must be strong and fine .</l>
     <l n="10">In smelting pot of massive size they placed the needed ore ;</l>
     <l n="11">A molten mass it soon became , but ere in mould they pour ,</l>
     <l n="12">And thus provide a bell for God to grace His temple fair ,</l>
     <l n="13">In crowds the people came , to see the metal glowing there .</l>
     <l n="14">Then as they passed , with hearts devout , each took a silver coin</l>
     <l n="15">And dropped it in the glowing mass — no priest did this enjoin .</l>
     <l n="16">They wished to show their grateful love to Him who bore their sin ;</l>
     <l n="17">A simple form which love took on , not done God 's grace to win .</l>
     <l n="18">Nor did they hope to win applause from priest and saintly friar ;</l>
     <l n="19">If God were pleased they asked no more , nor more did they desire ;</l>
     <l n="20">Nor did they deem their silver lost , though little dreamed they then</l>
     <l n="21">The grand result of their small gifts , which now is known to men .</l>
     <l n="22">Their coins were for a moment seen , like flakes of snow on sward ,</l>
     <l n="23">And then they melted out of sight , yet , seen by their blest Lord ,</l>
     <l n="24">They mingled with the glowing mass , and when in high church tower</l>
     <l n="25">The bell was hung and daily rung , all people felt its power .</l>
     <l n="26">Its booming tones were soft and sweet , and echoed o'er their hills</l>
     <l n="27">In a grand symphony of praise , subduing all their wills ,</l>
     <l n="28">And calling forth from old and young a burst of rapturous praise .</l>
     <l n="29">Their gifts , though small , were not despised ; God turned them into lays .</l>
     <l n="30">This world is one great smelting pot in which life 's ore is cast ,</l>
     <l n="31">And from it God will some day bring a bell , destined to last</l>
     <l n="32">And ring aloud in thunder tones wherever man is found .</l>
     <l n="33">Oh , may we , by kind words and deeds , give it a silver sound !</l>
     <l n="34">Each word though short , each deed though small , if for the Master 's sake</l>
     <l n="35">Are said and done , like silver coin , our blessed Lord will take ,</l>
     <l n="36">And skillfully will blend them with the coarser ore of earth ,</l>
     <l n="37">And grander music none have heard e'er since time had its birth .</l>
     <l n="38">Then from this bell of silver tone will sound o'er hill and vale :</l>
