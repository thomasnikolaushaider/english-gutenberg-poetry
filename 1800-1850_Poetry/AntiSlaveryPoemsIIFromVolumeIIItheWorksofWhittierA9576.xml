      <head>TO A SOUTHERN STATESMAN .</head>
      <head>John C. Calhoun , who had strongly urged the extension of slave territory by the annexation of Texas , even if it should involve a war with England , was unwilling to promote the acquisition of Oregon , which would enlarge the Northern domain of freedom , and pleaded as an excuse the peril of foreign complications which he had defied when the interests of slavery were involved .</head>

      <head>THE BRANDED HAND .</head>
      <head>Captain Jonathan Walker , of Harwich , Mass ., was solicited by several fugitive slaves at Pensacola , Florida , to carry them in his vessel to the British West Indies . Although well aware of the great hazard of the enterprise he attempted to comply with the request , but was seized at sea by an American vessel , consigned to the authorities at Key West , and thence sent back to Pensacola , where , after a long and rigorous confinement in prison , he was tried and sentenced to be branded on his right hand with the letters “ S. S . ” ( slave-stealer ) and amerced in a heavy fine .</head>

     <p>They change to wrong the duty which God hath written out On the great heart of humanity , too legible for doubt ! They , the loathsome moral lepers , blotched from footsole up to crown , Give to shame what God hath given unto honor and renown !</p>
     <p>Why , that brand is highest honor ! than its traces never yet Upon old armorial hatchments was a prouder blazon set ; And thy unborn generations , as they tread our rocky strand , Shall tell with pride the story of their father 's branded hand !</p>

      <head>A LETTER .</head>
      <head>Supposed to be written by the chairman of the “ Central Clique ” at Concord , N. H ., to the Hon . M. N ., Jr ., at Washington , giving the result of the election . The following verses were published in the Boston Chronotype in 1846 . They refer to the contest in New Hampshire , which resulted in the defeat of the pro-slavery Democracy , and in the election of John P. Hale to the United States Senate . Although their authorship was not acknowledged , it was strongly suspected . They furnish a specimen of the way , on the whole rather good-natured , in which the liberty-lovers of half a century ago answered the social and political outlawry and mob violence to which they were subjected .</head>

     <p>DANIEL NEALL . Dr. Neall , a worthy disciple of that venerated philanthropist , Warner Mifflin , whom the Girondist statesman , Jean Pierre Brissot , pronounced “ an angel of mercy , the best man he ever knew , ” was one of the noble band of Pennsylvania abolitionists , whose bravery was equalled only by their gentleness and tenderness . He presided at the great anti-slavery meeting in Pennsylvania Hall , May 17 , 1838 , when the Hall was surrounded by a furious mob . I was standing near him while the glass of the windows broken by missiles showered over him , and a deputation from the rioters forced its way to the platform , and demanded that the meeting should be closed at once . Dr. Neall drew up his tall form to its utmost height . “ I am here , ” he said , “ the president of this meeting , and I will be torn in pieces before I leave my place at your dictation . Go back to those who sent you . I shall do my duty . ” Some years after , while visiting his relatives in his native State of Delaware , he was dragged from the house of his friends by a mob of slave-holders and brutally maltreated . He bore it like a martyr of the old times ; and when released , told his persecutors that he forgave them , for it was not they but Slavery which had done the wrong . If they should ever be in Philadelphia and needed hospitality or aid , let them call on him .</p>
     <p>I . FRIEND of the Slave , and yet the friend of all ; Lover of peace , yet ever foremost when The need of battling Freedom called for men To plant the banner on the outer wall ; Gentle and kindly , ever at distress Melted to more than woman 's tenderness , Yet firm and steadfast , at his duty 's post Fronting the violence of a maddened host , Like some gray rock from which the waves are tossed ! Knowing his deeds of love , men questioned not The faith of one whose walk and word were right ; Who tranquilly in Life 's great task-field wrought , And , side by side with evil , scarcely caught A stain upon his pilgrim garb of white Prompt to redress another 's wrong , his own Leaving to Time and Truth and Penitence alone .</p>
     <p>II . Such was our friend . Formed on the good old plan , A true and brave and downright honest man He blew no trumpet in the market-place , Nor in the church with hypocritic face Supplied with cant the lack of Christian grace ; Loathing pretence , he did with cheerful will What others talked of while their hands were still ; And , while “ Lord , Lord ! ” the pious tyrants cried , Who , in the poor , their Master crucified , His daily prayer , far better understood In acts than words , was simply doing good . So calm , so constant was his rectitude , That by his loss alone we know its worth , And feel how true a man has walked with us on earth . 6th , 6th month , 1846 .</p>
     <p>SONG OF SLAVES IN THE DESERT .</p>
     <p>“ Sebah , Oasis of Fezzan , 10th March , 1846 .— This evening the female slaves were unusually excited in singing , and I had the curiosity to ask my negro servant , Said , what they were singing about . As many of them were natives of his own country , he had no difficulty in translating the Mandara or Bornou language . I had often asked the Moors to translate their songs for me , but got no satisfactory account from them . Said at first said , ‘ Oh , they sing of Rubee ’ ( God ) . ‘ What do you mean ? ’ I replied , impatiently . ‘ Oh , do n't you know ? ’ he continued , ‘ they asked God to give them their Atka ? ’ ( certificate of freedom ) . I inquired , ‘ Is that all ? ’ Said : ‘ No ; they say , “ Where are we going ? The world is large . O God ! Where are we going ? O God ! " ’ I inquired , ` What else ? ’ Said : ` They remember their country , Bornou , and say , “ Bornou was a pleasant country , full of all good things ; but this is a bad country , and we are miserable ! " ’ ` Do they say anything else ? ’ Said : ‘ No ; they repeat these words over and over again , and add , “ O God ! give us our Atka , and let us return again to our dear home . " ’</p>
     <p>“ I am not surprised I got little satisfaction when I asked the Moors about the songs of their slaves . Who will say that the above words are not a very appropriate song ? What could have been more congenially adapted to their then woful condition ? It is not to be wondered at that these poor bondwomen cheer up their hearts , in their long , lonely , and painful wanderings over the desert , with words and sentiments like these ; but I have often observed that their fatigue and sufferings were too great for them to strike up this melancholy dirge , and many days their plaintive strains never broke over the silence of the desert . ” — Richardson 's Journal in Africa .</p>

      <head>YORKTOWN .</head>
      <head>Dr. Thacher , surgeon in Scammel 's regiment , in his description of the siege of Yorktown , says : “ The labor on the Virginia plantations is performed altogether by a species of the human race cruelly wrested from their native country , and doomed to perpetual bondage , while their masters are manfully contending for freedom and the natural rights of man . Such is the inconsistency of human nature . ” Eighteen hundred slaves were found at Yorktown , after its surrender , and restored to their masters . Well was it said by Dr. Barnes , in his late work on Slavery : “ No slave was any nearer his freedom after the surrender of Yorktown than when Patrick Henry first taught the notes of liberty to echo among the hills and vales of Virginia . ”</head>

      <head>THE SLAVES OF MARTINIQUE .</head>
       <l n="1">Suggested by a daguerreotype taken from a small French engraving of two</l>
       <l n="2">negro figures , sent to the writer by Oliver Johnson .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>BEAMS of noon , like burning lances , through the tree-tops flash and glisten , As she stands before her lover , with raised face to look and listen .</p>
     <p>Dark , but comely , like the maiden in the ancient Jewish song Scarcely has the toil of task-fields done her graceful beauty wrong .</p>
     <p>He , the strong one and the manly , with the vassal 's garb and hue , Holding still his spirit 's birthright , to his higher nature true ;</p>
     <p>Hiding deep the strengthening purpose of a freeman in his heart , As the gregree holds his Fetich from the white man 's gaze apart .</p>
     <p>Ever foremost of his comrades , when the driver 's morning horn Calls away to stifling mill-house , to the fields of cane and corn .</p>
     <p>Fall the keen and burning lashes never on his back or limb ; Scarce with look or word of censure , turns the driver unto him .</p>
     <p>Yet , his brow is always thoughtful , and his eye is hard and stern ; Slavery 's last and humblest lesson he has never deigned to learn .</p>
     <p>And , at evening , when his comrades dance before their master 's door , Folding arms and knitting forehead , stands he silent evermore .</p>
     <p>God be praised for every instinct which rebels against a lot Where the brute survives the human , and man 's upright form is not !</p>
     <p>As the serpent-like bejuco winds his spiral fold on fold Round the tall and stately ceiba , till it withers in his hold ;</p>
     <p>Slow decays the forest monarch , closer girds the fell embrace , Till the tree is seen no longer , and the vine is in its place ;</p>
     <p>So a base and bestial nature round the vassal 's manhood twines , And the spirit wastes beneath it , like the ceiba choked with vines .</p>
     <p>God is Love , saith the Evangel ; and our world of woe and sin Is made light and happy only when a Love is shining in .</p>
     <p>Ye whose lives are free as sunshine , finding , where - soe'er ye roam , Smiles of welcome , looks of kindness , making all the world like home ;</p>
     <p>In the veins of whose affections kindred blood is but a part ., Of one kindly current throbbing from the universal heart ;</p>
     <p>Can ye know the deeper meaning of a love in Slavery nursed , Last flower of a lost Eden , blooming in that Soil accursed ?</p>
     <p>Love of Home , and Love of Woman !— dear to all , but doubly dear To the heart whose pulses elsewhere measure only hate and fear .</p>
     <p>All around the desert circles , underneath a brazen sky , Only one green spot remaining where the dew is never dry !</p>
     <p>From the horror of that desert , from its atmosphere of hell , Turns the fainting spirit thither , as the diver seeks his bell .</p>
     <p>‘ T is the fervid tropic noontime ; faint and low the sea-waves beat ; Hazy rise the inland mountains through the glimmer of the heat ,—</p>
     <p>Where , through mingled leaves and blossoms , arrowy sunbeams flash and glisten , Speaks her lover to the slave-girl , and she lifts her head to listen :—</p>
     <p>“ We shall live as slaves no longer ! Freedom 's hour is close at hand ! Rocks her bark upon the waters , rests the boat upon the strand !</p>
     <p>“ I have seen the Haytien Captain ; I have seen his swarthy crew , Haters of the pallid faces , to their race and color true .</p>
     <p>“ They have sworn to wait our coming till the night has passed its noon , And the gray and darkening waters roll above the sunken moon ! ”</p>
     <p>Oh , the blessed hope of freedom ! how with joy and glad surprise , For an instant throbs her bosom , for an instant beam her eyes !</p>
     <p>But she looks across the valley , where her mother 's hut is seen , Through the snowy bloom of coffee , and the lemon - leaves so green .</p>
     <p>And she answers , sad and earnest : “ It were wrong for thee to stay ; God hath heard thy prayer for freedom , and his finger points the way .</p>
     <p>“ Well I know with what endurance , for the sake of me and mine , Thou hast borne too long a burden never meant for souls like thine .</p>
     <p>“ Go ; and at the hour of midnight , when our last farewell is o'er , Kneeling on our place of parting , I will bless thee from the shore .</p>
     <p>“ But for me , my mother , lying on her sick-bed all the day , Lifts her weary head to watch me , coming through the twilight gray .</p>
     <p>“ Should I leave her sick and helpless , even freedom , shared with thee , Would be sadder far than bondage , lonely toil , and stripes to me .</p>
     <p>“ For my heart would die within me , and my brain would soon be wild ; I should hear my mother calling through the twilight for her child ! ”</p>
     <p>Blazing upward from the ocean , shines the sun of morning-time , Through the coffee-trees in blossom , and green hedges of the lime .</p>
     <p>Side by side , amidst the slave-gang , toil the lover and the maid ; Wherefore looks he o'er the waters , leaning forward on his spade ?</p>
     <p>Sadly looks he , deeply sighs he : ‘ t is the Haytien 's sail he sees , Like a white cloud of the mountains , driven seaward by the breeze .</p>
     <p>But his arm a light hand presses , and he hears a low voice call Hate of Slavery , hope of Freedom , Love is mightier than all . 1848 .</p>
     <p>THE CURSE OF THE CHARTER-BREAKERS .</p>
     <p>The rights and liberties affirmed by Magna Charta were deemed of such importance , in the thirteenth century , that the Bishops , twice a year , with tapers burning , and in their pontifical robes , pronounced , in the presence of the king and the representatives of the estates of England , the greater excommunication against the infringer of that instrument . The imposing ceremony took place in the great Hall of Westminster . A copy of the curse , as pronounced in 1253 , declares that , “ by the authority of Almighty God , and the blessed Apostles and Martyrs , and all the saints in heaven , all those who violate the English liberties , and secretly or openly , by deed , word , or counsel , do make statutes , or observe then being made , against said liberties , are accursed and sequestered from the company of heaven and the sacraments of the Holy Church . ”</p>
     <p>William Penn , in his admirable political pamphlet , England 's Present Interest Considered , alluding to the curse of the Charter - breakers , says : “ I am no Roman Catholic , and little value their other curses ; yet I declare I would not for the world incur this curse , as every man deservedly doth , who offers violence to the fundamental freedom thereby repeated and confirmed . ”</p>

O my brothers ! let us choose the righteous side .</p>
     <p>So shall the Northern pioneer go joyful on his way ; To wed Penobseot 's waters to San Francisco 's bay ; To make the rugged places smooth , and sow the vales with grain ; And bear , with Liberty and Law , the Bible in his train The mighty West shall bless the East , and sea shall answer sea , And mountain unto mountain call , Praise God , for we are free 1845 .</p>
