    <head>THE HILLS .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Behind my father 's cottage lies</l>
     <l n="2">A gentle grassy height</l>
     <l n="3">Up which I often ran — to gaze</l>
     <l n="4">Back with a wondering sight ,</l>
     <l n="5">For then the chimneys I thought high</l>
     <l n="6">Were down below me quite !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">All round , where'er I turned mine eyes ,</l>
     <l n="8">Huge hills closed up the view ;</l>
     <l n="9">The town ‘ mid their converging roots</l>
     <l n="10">Was clasped by rivers two ;</l>
     <l n="11">From , one range to another sprang</l>
     <l n="12">The sky 's great vault of blue .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">It was a joy to climb their sides ,</l>
     <l n="14">And in the heather lie !</l>
     <l n="15">A joy to look at vantage down</l>
     <l n="16">On the castle grim and high !</l>
     <l n="17">Blue streams below , white clouds above ,</l>
     <l n="18">In silent earth and sky !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">And now , where'er my feet may roam ,</l>
     <l n="20">At sight of stranger hill</l>
     <l n="21">A new sense of the old delight</l>
     <l n="22">Springs in my bosom still ,</l>
     <l n="23">And longings for the high unknown</l>
     <l n="24">Their ancient channels fill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">For I am always climbing hills ,</l>
     <l n="26">From the known to the unknown —</l>
     <l n="27">Surely , at last , on some high peak ,</l>
     <l n="28">To find my Father 's throne ,</l>
     <l n="29">Though hitherto I have only found</l>
     <l n="30">His footsteps in the stone !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">And in my wanderings I did meet</l>
     <l n="32">Another searching too :</l>
     <l n="33">The dawning hope , the shared quest</l>
     <l n="34">Our thoughts together drew ;</l>
     <l n="35">Fearless she laid her band in mine</l>
     <l n="36">Because her heart was true .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">She was not born among the hills ,</l>
     <l n="38">Yet on each mountain face</l>
     <l n="39">A something known her inward eye</l>
     <l n="40">By inborn light can trace ;</l>
     <l n="41">For up the hills must homeward be ,</l>
     <l n="42">Though no one knows the place .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="43">Clasp my hand close , my child , in thine —</l>
     <l n="44">A long way we have come !</l>
     <l n="45">Clasp my hand closer yet , my child ,</l>
     <l n="46">Farther we yet must roam —</l>
     <l n="47">Climbing and climbing till we reach</l>
     <l n="48">Our heavenly father 's home .</l>

      <l n="6">Wide awake and wide alone !</l>

      <l n="20">Onward , onward something goads !</l>
      <l n="21">I will take the mountain path ,</l>
      <l n="22">Beard the storm within its den ;</l>
      <l n="23">Know the worst of this dim wrath</l>

      <l n="36">Guided by the river 's flow ;</l>
      <l n="37">And a music rises ever ,</l>

      <l n="2">Quiet I lay at last , and knew no more</l>
      <l n="3">Whether I breathed or not , so worn I lay</l>
      <l n="4">With the death-struggle . What was yet before</l>
      <l n="5">Neither I met , nor turned from it away ;</l>
      <l n="6">My only conscious being was the rest</l>
      <l n="7">Of pain gone dead — dead with the bygone day ,</l>
      <l n="8">And long I could have lingered all but blest</l>
      <l n="9">In that half-slumber . But there came a sound</l>
      <l n="10">As of a door that opened — in the west</l>
      <l n="11">Somewhere I thought it . As the hare the hound ,</l>
      <l n="12">The noise did start my eyelids and they rose .</l>
      <l n="13">I turned my eyes and looked . Then straight I found</l>
      <l n="14">It was my chamber-door that did unclose ,</l>
      <l n="15">For a tall form up to my bedside drew .</l>
      <l n="16">Grand was it , silent , its very walk repose ;</l>

      <l n="31">Taking me by the shoulders down he bent ,</l>
      <l n="32">And lifted me . I was in sickly case ,</l>

      <l n="220">My heart I could not . Seeming to divine</l>
      <l n="221">My hidden trouble , gently he stooped and kissed</l>

      <l n="233">And on his lips a faint ethereal smile</l>
      <l n="234">Hovered , as hangs the mist of its own hue</l>
      <l n="235">Trembling about a purple flower , the while</l>
      <l n="236">Evening grows brown . “ Brother ! brother ! ” I cried ;</l>

      <l n="239">A moment more he stood , then softly sighed .</l>

      <l n="264">Then — ” He ceased not ; his holy utterance still</l>
      <l n="265">Flowing went on , like spring from hidden store</l>
      <l n="266">Of wasteless waters ; but I wept my fill ,</l>
      <l n="267">Nor heeded much the comfort of his speech .</l>

      <l n="274">Prone on the ground before him I did fall ,</l>

      <l n="279">“ But something separates us , ” yet I cried ;</l>
      <l n="280">“ Let light at least begin the dark to chase ,</l>
      <l n="281">The dark begin to waver and divide ,</l>
      <l n="282">And clear the path of vision . In the old time ,</l>
      <l n="283">When clouds one heart did from the other hide ,</l>
      <l n="284">A wind would blow between ! If I would climb ,</l>

      <l n="289">Give out one perfect note in its great quire ;</l>

      <l n="315">At length , of lowly shrubs a scattered fringe ;</l>
      <l n="316">And last , a gloomy forest , almost blind ,</l>
      <l n="317">For on its roof no sun-ray did impinge ,</l>
      <l n="318">So that its very leaves did share the mind</l>

      <l n="365">I woke , with calmness cleansed and sanctified —</l>
      <l n="366">The peace that filled my heart of old , when I</l>
      <l n="367">Woke in my mother 's lap ; for since I died</l>
      <l n="368">The past lay bare , even to the dreaming shy</l>
      <l n="369">That shadowed my yet gathering unborn brain .</l>
      <l n="370">And , marvelling , on the floor I saw , close by</l>
      <l n="371">My elbow-pillowed head , as if it had lain</l>
      <l n="372">Beside me all the time I dreamless lay ,</l>
      <l n="373">A little pool of sunlight , which did stain</l>
      <l n="374">The earthen brown with gold ; marvelling , I say ,</l>
      <l n="375">Because , across the sea and through the wood ,</l>
      <l n="376">No sun had shone upon me all the way .</l>
      <l n="377">I rose , and through a chink the glade I viewed ,</l>
      <l n="378">But all was dull as it had always been ,</l>

      <l n="380">With hardly light enough to show it green ;</l>

      <l n="382">By a rough hole entered that heavenly sheen .</l>
      <l n="383">Then I remembered in old years I had</l>
      <l n="384">Seen such a light — where , with dropt eyelids gloomed ,</l>
      <l n="385">Sitting on such a floor , dark women sad</l>
      <l n="386">In a low barn-like house where lay entombed</l>
      <l n="387">Their sires and children ; only there the door</l>
      <l n="388">Was open to the sun , which entering plumed</l>
      <l n="389">With shadowy palms the stones that on the floor</l>
      <l n="390">Stood up like lidless chests — again to find</l>
      <l n="391">That the soul needs no brain , but keeps her store</l>
      <l n="392">In hidden chambers of the eternal mind .</l>
      <l n="393">Thence backward ran my roused Memory</l>
      <l n="394">Down the ever-opening vista — back to blind</l>
      <l n="395">Anticipations while my soul did lie</l>
      <l n="396">Closed in my mother 's ; forward thence through bright</l>
      <l n="397">Spring morns of childhood , gay with hopes that fly</l>
      <l n="398">Bird-like across their doming blue and white ,</l>
      <l n="399">To passionate summer noons , to saddened eves</l>
      <l n="400">Of autumn rain , so on to wintred night ;</l>
      <l n="401">Thence up once more to the dewy dawn that weaves</l>
      <l n="402">Saffron and gold — weaves hope with still content ,</l>
      <l n="403">And wakes the worship that even wrong bereaves</l>
      <l n="404">Of half its pain . And round her as she went</l>
      <l n="405">Hovered a sense as of an odour dear</l>
      <l n="406">Whose flower was far — as of a letter sent</l>
      <l n="407">Not yet arrived — a footstep coming near ,</l>
      <l n="408">But , oh , how long delayed the lifting latch !—</l>
      <l n="409">As of a waiting sun , ready to peer</l>

      <l n="411">Over a sleeping beauty — babbling rime</l>
      <l n="412">About her lips , but no winged word to catch !</l>

      <l n="416">Was this the dungeon of my sinning sore —</l>
      <l n="417">A gentle hell of loneliness , foredoomed</l>
      <l n="418">For such as I , whose love was yet the core</l>
      <l n="419">Of all my being ? The brown shadow gloomed</l>
      <l n="420">Persistent , faded , warm . No ripple ran</l>
      <l n="421">Across the air , no roaming insect boomed .</l>
      <l n="422">“ Alas , ” I cried , “ I am no living man !</l>
      <l n="423">Better were darkness and the leave to grope</l>

    <head>THE THORN IN THE FLESH .</head>
     <l n="1">Within my heart a worm had long been hid .</l>

     <l n="8">But the small monster , softly burrowing ,</l>
     <l n="9">Near by God 's chamber had made itself a den ,</l>

     <l n="22">Then I cried out as if my heart would break .</l>

     <l n="24">I had forgotten , spoke : “ The law of the universe</l>
     <l n="25">Is this , ” he said : “ Weakness shall be the nurse</l>

    <head>A BROKEN PRAYER .</head>
     <l n="1">0 Lord , my God , how long</l>
     <l n="2">Shall my poor heart pant for a boundless joy ?</l>
     <l n="3">How long , O mighty Spirit , shall I hear</l>
     <l n="4">The murmur of Truth 's crystal waters slide</l>
     <l n="5">From the deep caverns of their endless being ,</l>
     <l n="6">But my lips taste not , and the grosser air</l>
     <l n="7">Choke each pure inspiration of thy will ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I am a denseness ‘ twixt me and the light ; 1 cannot round myself ; my purest thought , Ere it is thought , hath caught the taint of earth , And mocked me with hard thoughts beyond my will .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I would be a wind</l>
     <l n="2">Whose smallest atom is a viewless wing ,</l>
     <l n="3">All busy with the pulsing life that throbs</l>
     <l n="4">To do thy bidding ; yea , or the meanest thing</l>
     <l n="5">That has relation to a changeless truth ,</l>
     <l n="6">Could I but be instinct with thee — each thought</l>
     <l n="7">The lightning of a pure intelligence ,</l>
     <l n="8">And every act as the loud thunder-clap</l>
     <l n="9">Of currents warring for a vacuum .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">Lord , clothe me with thy truth as with a robe ;</l>
     <l n="11">Purge me with sorrow ; I will bend my head</l>
     <l n="12">And let the nations of thy waves pass over ,</l>
     <l n="13">Bathing me in thy consecrated strength ;</l>
     <l n="14">And let thy many-voiced and silver winds</l>
     <l n="15">Pass through my frame with their clear influence ,</l>
     <l n="16">O save me ; I am blind ; lo , thwarting shapes</l>
     <l n="17">Wall up the void before , and thrusting out</l>
     <l n="18">Lean arms of unshaped expectation , beckon</l>
     <l n="19">Down to the night of all unholy thoughts .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="20">Oh , when at midnight one of thy strong angels</l>
     <l n="21">Stems back the waves of earthly influence</l>
     <l n="22">That shape unsteady continents around me ,</l>
     <l n="23">And they draw off with the devouring gush</l>
     <l n="24">Of exile billows that have found a home ,</l>
     <l n="25">Leaving me islanded on unseen points ,</l>
     <l n="26">Hanging ‘ twixt thee and chaos — I have seen</l>
     <l n="27">Unholy shapes lop off my shining thoughts ,</l>
     <l n="28">And they have lent me leathern wings of fear ,</l>
     <l n="29">Of baffled pride and harrowing distrust ;</l>
     <l n="30">And Godhead , with its crown of many stars ,</l>
     <l n="31">Its pinnacles of flaming holiness ,</l>
     <l n="32">And voice of leaves in the green summer-time ,</l>
     <l n="33">Has seemed the shadowed image of a self !</l>
     <l n="34">Then my soul blackened ; and I rose to find</l>
     <l n="35">And grasp my doom , and cleave the arching deeps</l>
     <l n="36">Of desolation .</l>

     <l n="37">O Lord , my soul is a forgotten well</l>
     <l n="38">Clad round with its own rank luxuriance ;</l>
     <l n="39">A fountain a kind sunbeam searches for ,</l>
     <l n="40">Sinking the lustre of its arrowy finger</l>
     <l n="41">Through the long grass its own strange virtue</l>
     <l n="42">Hath blinded up its crystal eye withal :</l>
     <l n="43">Make me a broad strong river coming down</l>
     <l n="44">With shouts from its high hills , whose rocky hearts</l>
     <l n="45">Throb forth the joy of their stability</l>
     <l n="46">In watery pulses from their inmost deeps ;</l>
     <l n="47">And I shall be a vein upon thy world ,</l>

     <l n="52">With the firm battlements of special action .</l>
     <l n="53">Alas , my holy happy thoughts of thee</l>
     <l n="54">Make not perpetual nest within my soul ,</l>
     <l n="55">But like strange birds of dazzling colours stoop</l>
     <l n="56">The trailing glories of their sunward speed</l>
     <l n="57">For one glad moment , filling my blasted boughs</l>
     <l n="58">With the sunshine of their wings . Make me a forest</l>
     <l n="59">Of gladdest life wherein perpetual spring</l>
     <l n="60">Lifts up her leafy tresses in the wind .</l>
     <l n="61">Lo , now I see</l>
     <l n="62">Thy trembling starlight sit among my pines ,</l>
     <l n="63">And thy young moon slide down my arching boughs</l>
     <l n="64">With a soft sound of restless eloquence !</l>
     <l n="65">And I can feel a joy as when thy hosts</l>
     <l n="66">Of trampling winds , gathering in maddened bands ,</l>
     <l n="67">Roar upward through the blue and flashing day</l>
     <l n="68">Round my still depths of uncleft solitude .</l>

     <l n="72">The misty wind , slamming thy starry doors</l>
     <l n="73">With bitter jests :— “ Thou fool ! ” they seem to say ,</l>
     <l n="74">“ Thou hast no seed of goodness in thee ; all</l>

     <l n="78">And with the fulsome garniture of life</l>
     <l n="79">Built out the loathsome corpse ; thou art a child</l>
     <l n="80">Of night and death , even lower than a worm ;</l>
     <l n="81">Gather the skirts up of thy shadowy self ,</l>

     <l n="91">Oh , I have seen a thing of beauty stand</l>
     <l n="92">In the young moonlight of its upward thoughts ,</l>

     <l n="94">Of gladness , whispering leaves , and odorous plants ,</l>
     <l n="95">Until its large and spiritual eye</l>
     <l n="96">Burned with intensest love : my God , I could</l>

     <l n="98">Lest when the noontide of the summer 's sun</l>
     <l n="99">Let down the tented sunlight on the plain ,</l>

     <l n="109">Its beauty turned to ghastly loathsomeness !</l>
     <l n="110">Then a hand spurned me backwards from the clouds ,</l>
     <l n="111">And with the gather of a mighty whirlwind ,</l>
     <l n="112">Drew in the glittering gifts of life .</l>

    <head>A FRAGMENT .</head>
     <l n="1">When the cock crows loud from the glen ,</l>
     <l n="2">And the moor-cock chirrs from the heather ,</l>
     <l n="3">What hear ye and see ye then ,</l>
     <l n="4">Ye children of air and ether ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>1st Echo . A thunder as of waves at the rising of the moon , And a darkness on the graves though the day is at its noon .</p>
   <p>2nd Echo . A springing as of grass though the air is damp and chill , And a glimmer from the river that winds about the hill .</p>
   <p>1st Echo . A lapse of crags that leant from the mountain 's earthen sheath , And a shock of ruin sent on the river underneath .</p>
   <p>2nd Echo . A sound as of a building that groweth fair and good , And a piping of the thrushes from the hollow of the wood .</p>
   <p>1st Echo . A wailing as of lambs that have wandered from the flock , And a bleating of their dams that was answered from the rock .</p>
   <p>2nd Echo . A breathing as of cattle in the shadow where they dream , And a sound of children playing with the pebbles in the stream .</p>
   <p>1st Echo . A driving as of clouds in the kingdom of the air , And a tumult as of crowds that mingle everywhere .</p>
   <p>2nd Echo . A waving of the grass , and a passing o'er the lakes , And a shred of tempest-cloud in the glory when it breaks .</p>

     <l n="3">I am perplexed with thee that thou shouldst cost</l>
     <l n="4">This earth another turning ! All aglow</l>
     <l n="5">Thou shouldst have reached me , with a purple show</l>
     <l n="6">Along far mountain-tops ! and I would post</l>
     <l n="7">Over the breadth of seas , though I were lost</l>
     <l n="8">In the hot phantom-chase for life , if so</l>
     <l n="9">Thou earnest ever with this numbing sense</l>
     <l n="10">Of chilly distance and unlovely light ,</l>
     <l n="11">Waking this gnawing soul anew to fight</l>
     <l n="12">With its perpetual load : I drive thee hence !</l>
     <l n="13">I have another mountain-range from whence</l>
