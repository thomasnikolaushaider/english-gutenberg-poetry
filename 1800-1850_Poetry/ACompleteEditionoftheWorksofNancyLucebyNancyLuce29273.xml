    <head>Poor Tweedle , Tedel , Bebbee , Pinky . She is gone . She died June 19th , 1871 , at quarter past 7 o'clock in the evening , with my hands around her , aged 4 years . I never can see Poor little dear again .</head>

   <p>HENS — THEIR DISEASES AND CURE .</p>
   <p>Human , do understand how to raise up sick hens to health . Some folks do not know how to doctor hens , they doctor them wrong , it hurts them , and it is dreadful cruel to let them die . It is as distressing to dumb creatures to undergo sickness , and death , as it is for human , and as distressing to be crueled , and as distressing to suffer . God requires human to take good care of dumb creatures , and be kind to them , or not keep any . Now do understand , and I will tell you exact .</p>
   <p>STOPPAGE IN STOMACH .— If a hen has stoppage in her stomach , her corn stops in her crop , hard and swell large , and she sick , first work with your fingers carefully , get it soft , then take a small teaspoon and measure it full of epsom salts , and dissolve it in water , and give it to her with a teaspoon ; you must keep to work with your fingers often , to keep it from hardening again , and the next day , if her breath smells bad , there is a rottenness in her stomach , then give her most as much of epsom salts again . Put a little flour porridge in her mouth with a teaspoon , three times a day , and a little soaked cracker , soaked in water ; put a little in her mouth if she can swallow it , in five days she eat with the hens and be well . This is the way I cure them . Folks bring hens to me in this disease , to the point of death , been sick a long time , I cure them in five days ; they must not have any milk in this disease , it will kill them , do as I tell you and you can cure them . Once in a great while one of my hens have stoppage in their stomach ; I cure them with only my fingers , because I take her as soon as the corn stops . Milk does not agree with hens in sickness nor health , it keeps up in their stomach , and they vomit it up . I think strange it does not agree with hens , because milk is so good for human . You must not give your hens any castor oil , nor rhubarb , in not any disease whatever ; it is poison for them , my reason tells me so , and I hear of folks killing their hens by giving them such stuff . My hens all keep healthy , because I keep them clean , and keep victuals and clean water standing by them , and take good care of them . I can cure a good many diseases for hens , but I cannot cure every disease . Every once in a while a sick hen is brought to me , to the point of death , been sick a great while , most dead , some ail one disease , some ail a number of diseases ; I receive them into my care , I doctor them , and take care of them , I raise them up to health , I am unable to do anything , but I must take pity .</p>
   <p>FROTH IN THROAT .— If a hen has froth in her throat and crop , measure a small teaspoonful of epsom salts , dissolve it , put in a little black pepper , and give it to her with a teaspoon , it will cure this disease ; but if she make a screaming noise with it , and distressed with it , then a sore growing in her , then no cure .</p>
   <p>GAPES .— If a hen or chicken gapes a great deal , and sick , and complains of her throat , make pills of black pepper , cream , white flour , and put a pill in her mouth and make her swallow it till she takes down enough ; the black pepper kills the worms . I cure them so .</p>
   <p>BAG STONE .— This is a seldom case , I have known this case once in a while . If a hen has a bag of stones grow in her , hang down under her , you must give her the best of good cake to eat , the stones will consume in a few weeks , then she will eat corn and oats with the hens , and lay you eggs ; but if you do not give her the best of cake she will certainly die , she cannot eat anything else then , in this disease , but best of cake . I cured them so .</p>
   <p>SKIN IN HEN .— If a hen goes on her nest , and try to lay an egg , and cannot , and there most all day , then a skin of an egg is in her , she will certainly die if the skin of egg is not took out of her ; some one has a small finger , and common sense , take the skin of egg out of her , then she is all right . I cure them so .</p>
   <p>BONES .— If a hen is wounded in her hips , or any of her bones , bathe freely with McQuesten 's Extractor a number of times every day , put on a good deal , till she gets well ; I have cured a number of hens with this Extractor , they could not stand nor walk , their bones was so spraint , and so wrenched , &amp; c. If their bones stiff too , then put on Dr. Job Sweet 's Sprain Liniment , if any sore , then put on castile soap . I cure them so .</p>
   <p>WILD .— I bought a young hen last year , she was dreadful wild , and when one week was at an end she came to me , and let me take her up , she keep still , and eat out of my hand , she remains gentle ever since , and a good hen to lay eggs .</p>
   <p>GREEN .— If a hen has bright green come from her , look same as bright green paint , with yellow in it , give her rice water with nutmeg grated in it , and Jamaica ginger , a number of times a day , till it cures this disease . I cure them in a few days .</p>
   <p>FEELING .— It is your duty to take good care , and not let anything hurt your hens , consider dear little hens .</p>
   <p>BIRDS .— When I step down to the door , the little harmless birds come fly down on the ground , only one yard off my feet , and some of them half a yard off my feet . I give them oats and dough to eat ; they eat it . Will they come to any one else ? so few folks have feeling .</p>
   <p>DIARRHOEA .— - If a hen has diarrhoea , and pain with it , you must be as careful about what she eats , as her medicines ; she must not have not any corn , and not any corn meal dough , not till she is well . Give her a little warm flour porridge , five times a day , with a teaspoon ; her medicine , Jamaica ginger , put in warm rice water , and grate in good deal nutmeg , give it to her three times a day , take good care of her , and she get well . I cure them so .</p>
   <p>LICE .— Human , some of them , have lice on their hens , it is cruel , the reason is , the hen-house above the ground , and keep dirty , that breeds lice on hens , and breeds diseases too ; have a cellar for your hens , and take up the dressing every morning , be no lice , lice will not breed in a cellar , I never have any lice on my hens , and they keep healthy . Folks bring sick hens to me , I cure them , and lice on them too , I put black pepper in their feathers , it kills the lice . God meant for human to take good care of dumb creatures , and be kind to them , or not keep any . Do by dumb creatures as you would wish to be done by if you was dumb creatures , consider how you would feel .</p>
   <p>COWS .— Meal is good for cows , but it will not do for her to have it dry , it gets in her nose and lungs , and hurt her , wet it ; the best way is to scald it , and cool it , does more good . Cracked corn is better ; boil it , put on cover , it steams it soft very soon , one quart makes two and a half . Cows must not have dusty hay , it hurts their lungs , &amp; c. Cows ought not to have Timothy herds grass hay , it is physic . Hay ought to be wet .</p>
   <p>WARPED NECK .— If a hen has warped neck , rub on castor oil , faithful , a number of times , and give her a little Huile D'olive to take inside , a good chance , her neck come in place again .</p>
   <p>SWELLED HEAD .— If a hen has swelled head and face , and blue black , put on Huile D'olive , I had one so , I cured her .</p>
   <p>FEVER .— If a hen has a fever , and her crop swelled soft , take a small teaspoon full of epsom salts and dissolve it in warm water , and put in a little black pepper in it , and give it to her with a teaspoon , and give her as much warm water as she wants to drink in her sickness , I cure hens and chickens so in three days , and give her a little porridge with a teaspoon , five times a day , till she is able to eat . I cure them so .</p>
   <p>FEELING .— If any one is cruel to dumb creatures , they will go to everlasting punishment , and have the greatest punishment .</p>
   <p>SICK , I am , and very unable to do anything , but I must take pity ,— dear little hens .</p>
   <p>God is good , love and truth , merciful in all his ways . If the will of God could be done in full , it would be a great happiness among dumb creatures and human too . Cruelty is of the evil one . The good God is looking down upon such folks ; He will cast them off to everlasting punishment . Human must do God 's commandments in deeds , words and thoughts . Be kind to poor hens in every way , and not let them suffer with hunger nor cold ; cruelty not in any way ; must not affrighten them ; doctor them when they have diseases . Be good and kind to them . Think how good God is . Act up to His will in all your ways and all your thoughts too . You must keep your hens from suffering with cold , and give them enough to eat , and keep them clean , and not affrighten them , &amp; c ., &amp; c ., or they cannot lay you eggs . If your hens or chickens have their crops swelled soft , and a fever , give them a portion of Epsom salts , with a little black pepper in it , and give them as much warm water as they can drink ; in their sickness take good care of them , they get well . If they have stoppage in their stomach , their crop swelled hard , take your fingers and jam carefully till their crop is soft , then give them a portion of Epsom salts . I have cured them with only my fingers , they get well . If they have itching feet and scurfy , if mutton tallow will not cure it , then put their feet in a thing of warm water and wash them every morning till they get well . When they shed their feathers , their stomach is weak then , they must have soft victuals then , hard corn will distress their stomach then . If hen 's body comes out , put it back in her and see to her , she be well by the next day . If it comes more than half way out , it can be put back if any one has common sense . If a string of hen 's insides comes out , with a egg fast to it , break the egg , and take it off from her insides and put her insides back in her and see to her , she be well by the next day . If hen 's legs chilled with cold for want of sun , and they cannot walk , take them by the fire and rub their legs and feet , faithful , half a day , then rub on black pepper mixed with warm water , they get well . If a hen is starved she must not have hard corn at first , give her flour bread soaked soft in milk , till she is able to eat corn . Hens must not go in snow , it hurts them . They must not have fat meat . They must not be crowded , their room must be large enough . Their roosts must not be too high , for them to fly down on hard floor , it hurts their feet and hips . I know it . Hens want sun in winter and shade in summer . If hens ’ feet crack , bleed , and sore places , melt mutton tallow and white sugar together , rub it on faithful , they get well . If they bleed great deal , put on warm alum water first , they get well . If hens ’ feet swell , put on sweet apple balsam every day , they get well . If hens ’ head turns over , give her Epsom salts and black pepper , she get over it for a while . If hens have diarrhoea , give them boiled rice , black pepper , nutmeg , mixed , they get well if you take good care of them . Hens must not have fish , it physics them . Hens must not have anything relaxing . If hens have rattling in their throat give them Epsom salts and black pepper , they get well . If hen has her head quiver , and stagger , give her Epsom salts , and keep her quiet , and her food soak cracker in milk , she get well . If hens taken lame in the afternoon without being hurt , rub on mutton tallow and black pepper , they get well . If hen 's bones spraint or bruised , bathe freely with Mequesten 's Extracter , take good care of her , she get well in time , must have little time for it . This medicine will cure burns , scalds , on human , no doubt on hens too . It will cure sores , put it on when they first begin to come . If anything ails hens ’ eyes , rain-water is good , new milk put on , mutton tallow put around her eyes , salve made of rose water and cream , put around her eyes . Hens must not be confined in wind , it hurts them , they cannot lay you eggs . God placed us in this world to be kind to dumb creatures , or not keep any , and kind to human too . Consider what a wickedness it is to go contrary from it . I keep cow and hens , I do my duty for them . If hens have watery stomachs give them black pepper , put it in their dough , if they are able to eat it , if not able , then mix the pepper with water , and give it to her with a teaspoon , be careful and not have it too strong , to take her breath . If hens have pip , give them the same medicine , it will cure pip and watery stomach . Help them in season . If hen has swelled throat , put on sweet oil and black pepper , she get well . You must not give your hens salt , it will kill them . You must not give them rye , it will hurt them . If hen lays soft shell eggs , let her set two or three weeks , she lay hard shell eggs again . You must take good care of your poor hens or they cannot lay you eggs . Hens must be kept clean and must not have any bad smell with them , it will poison them . You must not give them cayenne pepper , it will poison them , it drives a redness into their heads , then they fail till they die . Black pepper is good for them when they need it . Hens must have clean victuals and clean water to drink . Take the chill off the water in winter . Keep good yellow southern corn standing by them , they take a little when they want it , it does them more good , and it takes less to keep them . Give them boiled oats , it is good for them to lay eggs . I give my hens boiled oats all the time , and corn standing by them . I give them some other victuals too , sometimes , and sometimes I give them some boiled potatoes . I mash it with cream for them . My hens lay me more eggs than anybody 's hens anywhere , by what I hear . Good flour bread is splendid to make them lay eggs , but I am not able to cook it for them . The bread must not be sour . Keep fine clam shells by them , and gravel sand . They must be kept warm in winter and cool in summer . They must have clean , warm cellar room , you will have double the eggs . Take up the dressing every morning certain , and oftener , if they stay down there days . When cold , keep them in the cellar , when the weather is suitable , let them out days . If cold morning , keep them in till the sun gets up warm . Be clever to them . They must not be affrighted . They can never get over it . I hear what folks do all my days , and their poor hens cannot lay much and they die off . It is wicked for folks to be so cruel .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Be good and kind to all that breathes ,</l>
     <l n="2">Act up our good Saviour 's laws ,</l>
     <l n="3">Have tender feelings in your hearts ,</l>
     <l n="4">For all the poor , harmless dumb creatures .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My hens are all in better order since I had a cellar for them , than they were before , and lay me double the eggs . Hens must not suffer with the cold , nor no other sufferings , you cannot have eggs . Raise your chickens on good flour bread , it will make them healthy , grow fast and smart ; they must be fed often ; I do not think meal is very good for hens or chickens ; meal is splendid for cows . If you are forced to give your hens or chickens meal , you must sift it fine and scald it and cool it . I used to raise my chickens on flour middlings dough , it is splendid for them . Flour bread is better . I do not set any hens now . You must not let young chickens go in cold nor wet ground , nor rain , &amp; c ., &amp; c.
