      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">It was many and many a year ago ,</l>
       <l n="2">In a kingdom by the sea ,</l>
       <l n="3">That a maiden there lived whom you may know</l>
       <l n="4">By the name of ANNABEL LEE ;</l>
       <l n="5">And this maiden she lived with no other thought</l>
       <l n="6">Than to love and be loved by me .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">I was a child and she was a child ,</l>
       <l n="8">In this kingdom by the sea ;</l>
       <l n="9">But we loved with a love which was more than love —</l>
       <l n="10">I and my Annabel Lee ;</l>
       <l n="11">With a love that the wingèd seraphs of heaven</l>
       <l n="12">Coveted her and me .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="13">And this was the reason that , long ago ,</l>
       <l n="14">In this kingdom by the sea ,</l>
       <l n="15">A wind blew out of a cloud , chilling</l>
       <l n="16">My beautiful Annabel Lee ;</l>
       <l n="17">So that her highborn kinsmen came</l>
       <l n="18">And bore her away from me ,</l>
       <l n="19">To shut her up in a sepulchre</l>
       <l n="20">In this kingdom by the sea .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="21">The angels , not half so happy in heaven ,</l>

       <l n="24">In this kingdom by the sea )</l>
       <l n="25">That the wind came out of the cloud by night ,</l>
       <l n="26">Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee .</l>

       <l n="29">Of many far wiser than we —</l>
       <l n="30">And neither the angels in heaven above ,</l>
       <l n="31">Nor the demons down under the sea ,</l>
       <l n="32">Can ever dissever my soul from the soul</l>

       <l n="37">Of the beautiful Annabel Lee ;</l>
       <l n="38">And so , all the night-tide , I lie down by the side</l>
       <l n="39">Of my darling — my darling — my life and my bride ,</l>

      <head>THE RAVEN</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Once upon a midnight dreary , while I pondered , weak and weary ,</l>
       <l n="2">Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore ,</l>
       <l n="3">While I nodded , nearly napping , suddenly there came a tapping ,</l>
       <l n="4">As of some one gently rapping , rapping at my chamber door .</l>
       <l n="5">“ ‘ Tis some visitor , ” I muttered , “ tapping at my chamber door —</l>
       <l n="6">Only this , and nothing more . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">Ah , distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December ,</l>
       <l n="8">And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor .</l>
       <l n="9">Eagerly I wished the morrow ;— vainly I had sought to borrow</l>
       <l n="10">From my books surcease of sorrow — sorrow for the lost Lenore —</l>
       <l n="11">For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore —</l>
       <l n="12">Nameless here for evermore .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="13">And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain</l>
       <l n="14">Thrilled me — filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before ;</l>
       <l n="15">So that now , to still the beating of my heart , I stood repeating ,</l>
       <l n="16">“ ‘ Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door —</l>
       <l n="17">Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door ;—</l>
       <l n="18">This it is , and nothing more . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="19">Presently my soul grew stronger ; hesitating then no longer ,</l>
       <l n="20">“ Sir , ” said I , “ or Madam , truly your forgiveness I implore ;</l>
       <l n="21">But the fact is I was napping , and so gently you came rapping ,</l>
       <l n="22">And so faintly you came tapping , tapping at my chamber door ,</l>
       <l n="23">That I scarce was sure I heard you , ” — here I opened wide the door ;—</l>
       <l n="24">Darkness there , and nothing more .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="25">Deep into that darkness peering , long I stood there wondering ,</l>
       <l n="26">fearing ,</l>
       <l n="27">Doubting , dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before ;</l>
       <l n="28">But the silence was unbroken , and the stillness gave no token ,</l>
       <l n="29">And the only word there spoken was the whispered word , “ Lenore ! ”</l>
       <l n="30">This I whispered , and an echo murmured back the word , “ Lenore ! ” —</l>
       <l n="31">Merely this , and nothing more .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="32">Back into the chamber turning , all my soul within me burning ,</l>
       <l n="33">Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before .</l>
       <l n="34">“ Surely , ” said I , “ surely that is something at my window lattice :</l>
       <l n="35">Let me see , then , what thereat is , and this mystery explore —</l>
       <l n="36">Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore ;—</l>
       <l n="37">‘ Tis the wind and nothing more . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="38">Open here I flung the shutter , when , with many a flirt and flutter ,</l>
       <l n="39">In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore ;</l>
       <l n="40">Not the least obeisance made he ; not a minute stopped or stayed he ;</l>
       <l n="41">But , with mien of lord or lady , perched above my chamber door —</l>
       <l n="42">Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door —</l>
       <l n="43">Perched , and sat , and nothing more .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="44">Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling ,</l>
       <l n="45">By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore ,</l>
       <l n="46">“ Though thy crest be shorn and shaven , thou , ” I said , “ art sure no</l>
       <l n="47">craven ,</l>
       <l n="48">Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore —</l>
       <l n="49">Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night 's Plutonian shore ! ”</l>
       <l n="50">Quoth the Raven , “ Nevermore . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="51">Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly ,</l>
       <l n="52">Though its answer little meaning — little relevancy bore ;</l>
       <l n="53">For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being</l>
       <l n="54">Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door —</l>
       <l n="55">Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door ,</l>
       <l n="56">With such name as “ Nevermore . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="57">But the raven , sitting lonely on the placid bust , spoke only</l>
       <l n="58">That one word , as if his soul in that one word he did outpour .</l>
       <l n="59">Nothing further then he uttered — not a feather then he fluttered —</l>
       <l n="60">Till I scarcely more than muttered , “ other friends have flown</l>
       <l n="61">before —</l>
       <l n="62">On the morrow he will leave me , as my hopes have flown before . ”</l>
       <l n="63">Then the bird said , “ Nevermore . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="64">Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken ,</l>
       <l n="65">“ Doubtless , ” said I , “ what it utters is its only stock and store ,</l>
       <l n="66">Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster</l>
       <l n="67">Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore —</l>
       <l n="68">Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore</l>
       <l n="69">Of ‘ Never — nevermore ’ . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="70">But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling ,</l>
       <l n="71">Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird , and bust and</l>
       <l n="72">door ;</l>
       <l n="73">Then upon the velvet sinking , I betook myself to linking</l>
       <l n="74">Fancy unto fancy , thinking what this ominous bird of yore —</l>
       <l n="75">What this grim , ungainly , ghastly , gaunt and ominous bird of yore</l>
       <l n="76">Meant in croaking “ Nevermore . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="77">This I sat engaged in guessing , but no syllable expressing</l>
       <l n="78">To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom 's core ;</l>
       <l n="79">This and more I sat divining , with my head at ease reclining</l>
       <l n="80">On the cushion 's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er ,</l>
       <l n="81">But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er ,</l>
       <l n="82">She shall press , ah , nevermore !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="83">Then methought the air grew denser , perfumed from an unseen censer</l>
       <l n="84">Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor .</l>
       <l n="85">“ Wretch , ” I cried , “ thy God hath lent thee — by these angels he hath</l>

       <l n="87">Respite — respite and nepenthe , from thy memories of Lenore !</l>
       <l n="88">Quaff , oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore ! ”</l>

       <l n="23">Over spirits on the wing —</l>

       <l n="28">Is the passion of their sleep .</l>
       <l n="29">In the morning they arise ,</l>

       <l n="36">For the same end as before —</l>
       <l n="37">Videlicet a tent —</l>
