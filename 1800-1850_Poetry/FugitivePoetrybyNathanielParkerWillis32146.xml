    <head>THE SHUNAMITE . [ A ]</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">It was a sultry day of summer time .</l>
     <l n="2">The sun pour 'd down upon the ripen 'd grain</l>
     <l n="3">With quivering heat , and the suspended leaves</l>
     <l n="4">Hung motionless . The cattle on the hills</l>
     <l n="5">Stood still , and the divided flock were all</l>
     <l n="6">Laying their nostrils to the cooling roots ,</l>
     <l n="7">And the sky look 'd like silver , and it seem 'd</l>
     <l n="8">As if the air had fainted , and the pulse</l>
     <l n="9">Of nature had run down , and ceas 'd to beat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">‘ Haste thee , my child ! ’ the Syrian mother said ,</l>
     <l n="11">‘ Thy father is athirst ’ — and from the depths</l>
     <l n="12">Of the cool well under the leaning tree ,</l>
     <l n="13">She drew refreshing water , and with thoughts</l>
     <l n="14">Of God 's sweet goodness stirring at her heart ,</l>
     <l n="15">She bless 'd her beautiful boy , and to his way</l>
     <l n="16">Committed him . And he went lightly on ,</l>
     <l n="17">With his soft hands press 'd closely to the cool</l>
     <l n="18">Stone vessel , and his little naked feet</l>
     <l n="19">Lifted with watchful care , and o'er the hills ,</l>
     <l n="20">And thro ’ the light green hollows , where the lambs</l>
     <l n="21">Go for the tender grass , he kept his way ,</l>
     <l n="22">Wiling its distance with his simple thoughts ,</l>
     <l n="23">Till , in the wilderness of sheaves , with brows</l>
     <l n="24">Throbbing with heat , he set his burden down .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="25">Childhood is restless ever , and the boy</l>
     <l n="26">Stay 'd not within the shadow of the tree ,</l>
     <l n="27">But with a joyous industry went forth</l>
     <l n="28">Into the reapers ’ places , and bound up</l>
     <l n="29">His tiny sheaves , and plaited cunningly</l>
     <l n="30">The pliant withs out of the shining straw ,</l>
     <l n="31">Cheering their labor on , till they forgot</l>
     <l n="32">The very weariness of their stooping toil</l>
     <l n="33">In the beguiling of his earnest mirth .</l>
     <l n="34">Presently he was silent , and his eye</l>
     <l n="35">Closed as with dizzy pain , and with his hand</l>
     <l n="36">Press 'd hard upon his forehead , and his breast</l>
     <l n="37">Heaving with the suppression of a cry ,</l>
     <l n="38">He uttered a faint murmur , and fell back</l>
     <l n="39">Upon the loosen 'd sheaf , insensible .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="40">They bore him to his mother , and he lay</l>
     <l n="41">Upon her knees till noon — and then he died !</l>
     <l n="42">She had watch 'd every breath , and kept her hand</l>
     <l n="43">Soft on his forehead , and gaz 'd in upon</l>
     <l n="44">The dreamy languor of his listless eye ,</l>
     <l n="45">And she had laid back all his sunny curls ,</l>
     <l n="46">And kiss 'd his delicate lip , and lifted him</l>
     <l n="47">Into her bosom , till her heart grew strong —</l>
     <l n="48">His beauty was so unlike death ! She leaned</l>
     <l n="49">Over him now , that she might catch the low</l>
     <l n="50">Sweet music of his breath , that she had learn 'd</l>
     <l n="51">To love when he was slumbering at her side</l>
     <l n="52">In his unconscious infancy —</l>
     <l n="53">— “ So still !</l>
     <l n="54">‘ Tis a soft sleep ! How beautiful he lies ,</l>
     <l n="55">With his fair forehead , and the rosy veins</l>
     <l n="56">Playing so freshly in his sunny cheek !</l>
     <l n="57">How could they say that he would die ! Oh God !</l>
     <l n="58">I could not lose him ! I have treasured all</l>
     <l n="59">His childhood in my heart , and even now ,</l>
     <l n="60">As he has slept , my memory has been there ,</l>
     <l n="61">Counting like ingots all his winning ways —</l>
     <l n="62">His unforgotten sweetness —</l>
     <l n="63">— “ Yet so still !—</l>
     <l n="64">How like this breathless slumber is to death !</l>
     <l n="65">I could believe that in that bosom now</l>
     <l n="66">There were no pulse — it beats so languidly !</l>
     <l n="67">I cannot see it stir ; but his red lip !—</l>
     <l n="68">Death would not be so very beautiful !</l>
     <l n="69">And that half smile — would death have left that there ?</l>
     <l n="70">— And should I not have felt that he would die ?</l>
     <l n="71">And have I not wept over him ?— and prayed</l>
     <l n="72">Morning and night for him ?— and could he die ?</l>
     <l n="73">— No — God will keep him . He will be my pride</l>
     <l n="74">Many long years to come , and this fair hair</l>
     <l n="75">Will darken like his father 's , and his eye</l>
     <l n="76">Be of a deeper blue when he is grown ;</l>
     <l n="77">And he will be so tall , and I shall look</l>
     <l n="78">With such a pride upon him !— He to die ! ”</l>
     <l n="79">And the fond mother lifted his soft curls ,</l>
     <l n="80">And smiled , as if ‘ twere mockery to think</l>
     <l n="81">That such fair things could perish —</l>
     <l n="82">— Suddenly</l>
     <l n="83">Her hand shrunk from him , and the color fled</l>
     <l n="84">From her fix 'd lip , and her supporting knees</l>
     <l n="85">Were shook beneath her child . Her hand had touch 'd</l>
     <l n="86">His forehead , as she dallied with his hair —</l>
     <l n="87">And it was cold — like clay !— slow — very slow</l>
     <l n="88">Came the misgiving that her child was dead .</l>
     <l n="89">She sat a moment and her eyes were clos 'd</l>
     <l n="90">In a still prayer for strength , and then she took</l>
     <l n="91">His little hand and press 'd it earnestly —</l>
     <l n="92">And put her lip to his — and look 'd again</l>
     <l n="93">Fearfully on him — and then , bending low ,</l>
     <l n="94">She whisper 'd in his ear , “ My son !— My son ! ”</l>
     <l n="95">And as the echo died , and not a sound</l>
     <l n="96">Broke on the stillness , and he lay there still ,</l>
     <l n="97">Motionless on her knee — the truth would come !</l>
     <l n="98">And with a sharp , quick cry , as if her heart</l>
     <l n="99">Were crush 'd , she lifted him and held him close</l>
     <l n="100">Into her bosom — with a mother 's thought —</l>
     <l n="101">As if death had no power to touch him there !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="102">The man of God came forth , and led the child</l>
     <l n="103">Unto his mother , and went on his way .</l>
     <l n="104">And he was there — her beautiful — her own —</l>
     <l n="105">Living and smiling on her — with his arms</l>
     <l n="106">Folded about her neck , and his warm breath</l>
     <l n="107">Breathing upon her lips , and in her ear</l>
     <l n="108">The music of his gentle voice once more !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="109">Oh for a burning word that would express</l>
     <l n="110">The measure of a mother 's holy joy ,</l>
     <l n="111">When God has given back to her her child</l>
     <l n="112">From death 's dark portal ! It surpasseth words .</l>

    <head>SCENE IN GETHSEMANE .</head>
     <l n="1">The moon was shining yet . The Orient 's brow ,</l>
     <l n="2">Set with the morning star , was not yet dim ;</l>
     <l n="3">And the deep silence which subdues the breath</l>
     <l n="4">Like a strong feeling , hung upon the world</l>
     <l n="5">As sleep upon the pulses of a child .</l>
     <l n="6">‘ Twas the last watch of night . Gethsemane ,</l>
     <l n="7">With its bath 'd leaves of silver , seem 'd dissolv 'd</l>
     <l n="8">In visible stillness , and as Jesus ’ voice</l>
     <l n="9">With its bewildering sweetness met the ear</l>
     <l n="10">Of his disciples , it vibrated on</l>
     <l n="11">Like the first whisper in a silent world .</l>
     <l n="12">They came on slowly . Heaviness oppress 'd</l>
     <l n="13">The Saviour 's heart , and when the kindnesses</l>
     <l n="14">Of his deep love were pour 'd , he felt the need</l>
     <l n="15">Of near communion , for his gift of strength</l>
     <l n="16">Was wasted by the spirit 's weariness .</l>
     <l n="17">He left them there , and went a little on ,</l>
     <l n="18">And in the depth of that hush 'd silentness ,</l>
     <l n="19">Alone with God , he fell upon his face ,</l>
     <l n="20">And as his heart was broken with the rush</l>
     <l n="21">Of his surpassing agony , and death ,</l>
     <l n="22">Wrung to him from a dying universe ,</l>
     <l n="23">Were mightier than the Son of man could bear ,</l>
     <l n="24">He gave his sorrows way , and in the deep</l>
     <l n="25">Prostration of his soul , breathed out the prayer ,</l>
     <l n="26">“ Father , if it be possible with thee ,</l>
     <l n="27">Let this cup pass from me . ” Oh , how a word ,</l>
     <l n="28">Like the forc 'd drop before the fountain breaks ,</l>
     <l n="29">Stilleth the press of human agony !</l>
     <l n="30">The Saviour felt its quiet in his soul ;</l>
     <l n="31">And though his strength was weakness , and the light</l>
     <l n="32">Which led him on till now was sorely dim ,</l>
     <l n="33">He breathed a new submission — “ Not my will ,</l>
     <l n="34">But thine be done , oh Father ! ” As he spoke ,</l>
     <l n="35">Voices were heard in heaven , and music stole</l>
     <l n="36">Out from the chambers of the vaulted sky ,</l>
     <l n="37">As if the stars were swept like instruments .</l>
     <l n="38">No cloud was visible , but radiant wings</l>
     <l n="39">Were coming with a silvery rush to earth ,</l>
     <l n="40">And as the Saviour rose , a glorious one ,</l>
     <l n="41">With an illumin 'd forehead , and the light</l>
     <l n="42">Whose fountain is the mystery of God</l>
     <l n="43">Encalm 'd within his eye , bow 'd down to him ,</l>
     <l n="44">And nerv 'd him with a ministry of strength .</l>
     <l n="45">It was enough — and with his godlike brow</l>
     <l n="46">Re-written , of his Father 's messenger ,</l>
     <l n="47">With meekness , whose divinity is more</l>
     <l n="48">Than power and glory , he return 'd again</l>
     <l n="49">To his disciples , and awak 'd their sleep ,</l>
     <l n="50">For “ he that should betray him was at hand . ”</l>

    <head>CONTEMPLATION .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ They are all up — the innumerable stars —</l>
     <l n="2">And hold their place in heaven . My eyes have been</l>
     <l n="3">Searching the pearly depths through which they spring</l>
     <l n="4">Like beautiful creations , till I feel</l>
     <l n="5">As if it were a new and perfect world ,</l>
     <l n="6">Waiting in silence for the word of God</l>
     <l n="7">To breathe it into motion . There they stand ,</l>
     <l n="8">Shining in order , like a living hymn</l>
     <l n="9">Written in light , awaking at the breath</l>
     <l n="10">Of the celestial dawn , and praising Him</l>
     <l n="11">Who made them , with the harmony of spheres .</l>
     <l n="12">I would I had an angel 's ear to list</l>
     <l n="13">That melody ! I would that I might float</l>

     <l n="17">For music — rarer music ! I would bathe</l>
     <l n="18">My soul in a serener atmosphere</l>
     <l n="19">Than this ! I long to mingle with the flock</l>
     <l n="20">Led by the “ living waters , ” and lie down</l>
     <l n="21">In the “ green pastures ” of the better land !</l>
     <l n="22">When wilt thou break , dull fetter ! When shall I</l>
     <l n="23">Gather my wings ; and , like a rushing thought ,</l>
     <l n="24">Stretch onward , star by star , up into heaven ! ’</l>

     <l n="25">Thus mused Alethe . She was one to whom</l>
     <l n="26">Life had been like the witching of a dream ,</l>
     <l n="27">Of an untroubled sweetness . She was born</l>
     <l n="28">Of a high race , and laid upon the knee ,</l>
     <l n="29">With her soft eye perusing listlessly</l>
     <l n="30">The fretted roof , or , on Mosaic floors ,</l>
     <l n="31">Grasped at the tessellated squares , inwrought</l>
     <l n="32">With metals curiously . Her childhood pass 'd</l>
     <l n="33">Like faery — amid fountains and green haunts —</l>
     <l n="34">Trying her little feet upon a lawn</l>
     <l n="35">Of velvet evenness , and hiding flowers</l>
     <l n="36">In her sweet bosom , as it were a fair</l>
     <l n="37">And pearly altar to crush incense on .</l>

     <l n="39">A dream of poetry that may not be</l>
     <l n="40">Written or told — exceeding beautiful !</l>
     <l n="41">And so came worshippers ; and rank bow 'd down ,</l>
     <l n="42">And breathed upon her heart , as with a breath</l>
     <l n="43">Of pride , and bound her forehead gorgeously</l>
     <l n="44">With dazzling scorn , and gave unto her step</l>
     <l n="45">A majesty as if she trod the sea ,</l>
     <l n="46">And the proud waves , unbidden , lifted her .</l>
     <l n="47">And so she grew to woman — her mere look</l>
     <l n="48">Strong as a monarch 's signet , and her hand</l>
     <l n="49">The ambition of a kingdom .</l>

     <l n="54">Of a serener element , and drank</l>
     <l n="55">Philosophy , and for a little while</l>
     <l n="56">She was allay 'd — till , presently , it turn 'd</l>
     <l n="57">Bitter within her , and her spirit grew</l>

    <head>SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">He sat by me in school . His face is now</l>
     <l n="2">Vividly in my mind , as if he went</l>
     <l n="3">From me but yesterday — its pleasant smile</l>
     <l n="4">And the rich , joyous laughter of his eye ,</l>
     <l n="5">And the free play of his unhaughty lip ,</l>
     <l n="6">So redolent of his heart ! He was not fair ,</l>
     <l n="7">Nor singular , nor over-fond of books ,</l>
     <l n="8">And never melancholy when alone .</l>
     <l n="9">He was the heartiest in the ring , the last</l>
     <l n="10">Home from the summer 's wanderings , and the first</l>
     <l n="11">Over the threshold when the school was done .</l>
     <l n="12">All of us loved him . We shall speak his name</l>
     <l n="13">In the far years to come , and think of him</l>
     <l n="14">When we have lost life 's simplest passages ,</l>
     <l n="15">And pray for him — forgetting he is dead —</l>
     <l n="16">Life was in him so passing beautiful !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="17">His childhood had been wasted in the close</l>
     <l n="18">And airless city . He had never thought</l>
     <l n="19">That the blue sky was ample , or the stars</l>
     <l n="20">Many in heaven , or the chainless wind</l>
     <l n="21">Of a medicinal freshness . He had learn 'd</l>
     <l n="22">Perilous tricks of manhood , and his hand</l>
     <l n="23">Was ready , and his confidence in himself</l>
     <l n="24">Bold as a quarreller 's . Then he came away</l>
     <l n="25">To the unshelter 'd hills , and brought an eye</l>
     <l n="26">New as a babe 's to nature , and an ear</l>
     <l n="27">As ignorant of its music . He was sad .</l>
     <l n="28">The broad hill sides seem 'd desolate , and the woods</l>
     <l n="29">Gloomy and dim , and the perpetual sound</l>
     <l n="30">Of wind and waters and unquiet leaves</l>
     <l n="31">Like the monotony of a dirge . He pined</l>
     <l n="32">For the familiar things until his heart</l>
     <l n="33">Sicken 'd for home !— and so he stole away</l>
     <l n="34">To the most silent places , and lay down</l>
     <l n="35">To weep upon the mosses of the slopes ,</l>
     <l n="36">And follow 'd listlessly the silver streams ,</l>
     <l n="37">Till he found out the unsunn 'd shadowings ,</l>
     <l n="38">And the green openings to the sky , and grew</l>
     <l n="39">Fond of them all insensibly . He found</l>
     <l n="40">Sweet company in the brooks , and loved to sit</l>
     <l n="41">And bathe his fingers wantonly , and feel</l>
     <l n="42">The wind upon his forehead ; and the leaves</l>
     <l n="43">Took a beguiling whisper to his ear ,</l>
     <l n="44">And the bird-voices music , and the blast</l>
     <l n="45">Swept like an instrument the sounding trees .</l>
     <l n="46">His heart went back to its simplicity</l>
     <l n="47">As the stirr 'd waters in the night grow pure —</l>
     <l n="48">Sadness and silence and the dim-lit woods</l>
     <l n="49">Won on his love so well — and he forgot</l>
     <l n="50">His pride and his assumingness , and lost</l>
     <l n="51">The mimicry of the man , and so unlearn 'd</l>
     <l n="52">His very character till he became</l>
     <l n="53">As diffident as a girl .</l>
     <l n="54">‘ Tis very strange</l>
     <l n="55">How nature sometimes wins upon a child .</l>
     <l n="56">Th ’ experience of the world is not on him ,</l>
     <l n="57">And poetry has not upon his brain</l>
     <l n="58">Left a mock thirst for solitude , nor love</l>
     <l n="59">Writ on his forehead the effeminate shame</l>
     <l n="60">Which hideth from men 's eyes . He has a full ,</l>
     <l n="61">Shadowless heart , and it is always toned</l>
     <l n="62">More merrily than the chastened voice of winds</l>
     <l n="63">And waters — yet he often , in his mirth ,</l>
     <l n="64">Stops by the running brooks , and suddenly</l>
     <l n="65">Loiters , he knows not why , and at the sight</l>
     <l n="66">Of the spread meadows and the lifted hills</l>
     <l n="67">Feels an unquiet pleasure , and forgets</l>
     <l n="68">To listen for his fellows . He will grow</l>
     <l n="69">Fond of the early star , and lie awake</l>
     <l n="70">Gazing with many thoughts upon the moon ,</l>
     <l n="71">And lose himself in the deep chamber 'd sky</l>
     <l n="72">With his untaught philosophies . It breeds</l>
     <l n="73">Sadness in older hearts , but not in his ;</l>
     <l n="74">And he goes merrier to his play , and shouts</l>
     <l n="75">Louder the joyous call — but it will sink</l>
     <l n="76">Into his memory like his mother 's prayer ,</l>
     <l n="77">For after years to brood on .</l>
     <l n="78">Cheerful thoughts</l>
     <l n="79">Came to the homesick boy as he became</l>
     <l n="80">Wakeful to beauty in the summer 's change ,</l>
     <l n="81">And he came oftener to our noisy play ,</l>
     <l n="82">Cheering us on with his delightful shout</l>
     <l n="83">Over the hills , and giving interest</l>
     <l n="84">With his keen spirit to the boyish game .</l>
     <l n="85">We loved him for his carelessness of himself ,</l>
     <l n="86">And his perpetual mirth , and tho ’ he stole</l>
     <l n="87">Sometimes away into the woods alone ,</l>
     <l n="88">And wandered unaccompanied when the night</l>
     <l n="89">Was beautiful , he was our idol still ,</l>
     <l n="90">And we have not forgotten him , tho ’ time</l>
     <l n="91">Has blotted many a pleasant memory</l>
     <l n="92">Of boyhood out , and we are wearing old</l>
     <l n="93">With the unplayfulness of this grown up world .</l>

    <head>IDLENESS .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The rain is playing its soft pleasant tune</l>
     <l n="2">Fitfully on the skylight , and the shade</l>
     <l n="3">Of the fast flying clouds across my book</l>
     <l n="4">Passes with delicate change . My merry fire</l>
     <l n="5">Sings cheerfully to itself ; my musing cat</l>
     <l n="6">Purrs as she wakes from her unquiet sleep ,</l>
     <l n="7">And looks into my face as if she felt</l>
     <l n="8">Like me the gentle influence of the rain .</l>
     <l n="9">Here have I sat since morn , reading sometimes ,</l>
     <l n="10">And sometimes listening to the faster fall</l>
     <l n="11">Of the large drops , or rising with the stir</l>
     <l n="12">Of an unbidden thought , have walked awhile</l>
     <l n="13">With the slow steps of indolence , my room ,</l>
     <l n="14">And then sat down composedly again</l>
     <l n="15">To my quaint book of olden poetry .</l>
     <l n="16">It is a kind of idleness , I know ;</l>
     <l n="17">And I am said to be an idle man —</l>
     <l n="18">And it is very true . I love to go</l>
     <l n="19">Out in the pleasant sun , and let my eye</l>
     <l n="20">Rest on the human faces that pass by ,</l>
     <l n="21">Each with its gay or busy interest ;</l>
     <l n="22">And then I muse upon their lot , and read</l>
     <l n="23">Many a lesson in their changeful cast ,</l>
     <l n="24">And so grow kind of heart , as if the sight</l>
     <l n="25">Of human beings were humanity .</l>
     <l n="26">And I am better after it , and go</l>
     <l n="27">More gratefully to my rest , and feel a love</l>
     <l n="28">Stirring my heart to every living thing ,</l>
     <l n="29">And my low prayer has more humility ,</l>
     <l n="30">And I sink lightlier to my dreams — and this ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="32">I love to go and mingle with the young</l>
     <l n="33">In the gay festal room — when every heart</l>
     <l n="34">Is beating faster than the merry tune ,</l>
     <l n="35">And their blue eyes are restless , and their lips</l>
     <l n="36">Parted with eager joy , and their round cheeks</l>
     <l n="37">Flushed with the beautiful motion of the dance .</l>
     <l n="38">‘ Tis sweet , in the becoming light of lamps ,</l>
     <l n="39">To watch a brow half shaded , or a curl</l>
     <l n="40">Playing upon a neck capriciously ,</l>
     <l n="41">Or , unobserved , to watch in its delight ,</l>
     <l n="42">The earnest countenance of a child . I love</l>
     <l n="43">To look upon such things , and I can go</l>
     <l n="44">Back to my solitude , and dream bright dreams</l>
     <l n="45">For their fast coming years , and speak of them</l>
     <l n="46">Earnestly in my prayer , till I am glad</l>
     <l n="47">With a benevolent joy — and this , I know ,</l>

     <l n="67">Glad with the birds , and silent with the leaves ,</l>

     <l n="73">In their swift journey — and ‘ twould be a joy</l>
     <l n="74">To walk the chambers of the deep , and tread</l>

     <l n="76">The tribes of its unfathomable depths —</l>
     <l n="77">Dwellers beneath the pressure of a sea !</l>
     <l n="78">And I should love to issue with the wind</l>
     <l n="79">On a strong errand , and o'ersweep the earth ,</l>
     <l n="80">With its broad continents and islands green ,</l>
     <l n="81">Like to the passing of a presence on !—</l>

    <head>THE TRI-PORTRAIT .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ Twas a rich night in June . The air was all</l>
     <l n="2">Fragrance and balm , and the wet leaves were stirred</l>
     <l n="3">By the soft fingers of the southern wind ,</l>
     <l n="4">And caught the light capriciously , like wings</l>
     <l n="5">Haunting the greenwood with a silvery sheen .</l>
     <l n="6">The stars might not be numbered , and the moon</l>
     <l n="7">Exceeding beautiful , went up in heaven ,</l>
     <l n="8">And took her place in silence , and a hush ,</l>
     <l n="9">Like the deep Sabbath of the night , came down</l>
     <l n="10">And rested upon nature . I was out</l>
     <l n="11">With three sweet sisters wandering , and my thoughts</l>
     <l n="12">Took color of the moonlight , and of them ,</l>
     <l n="13">And I was calm and happy . Their deep tones ,</l>
     <l n="14">Low in the stillness , and by that soft air</l>
     <l n="15">Melted to reediness , bore out , like song ,</l>
     <l n="16">The language of high feelings , and I felt</l>
     <l n="17">How excellent is woman when she gives</l>
     <l n="18">To the fine pulses of her spirit way .</l>
     <l n="19">One was a noble being , with a brow</l>
     <l n="20">Ample and pure , and on it her black hair</l>
     <l n="21">Was parted , like a raven 's wing on snow .</l>
     <l n="22">Her tone was low and sweet , and in her smile</l>
     <l n="23">You read intense affections . Her moist eye</l>
     <l n="24">Had a most rare benignity ; her mouth ,</l>
     <l n="25">Bland and unshadowed sweetness ; and her face</l>
     <l n="26">Was full of that mild dignity that gives</l>
     <l n="27">A holiness to woman . She was one</l>
     <l n="28">Whose virtues blossom daily , and pour out</l>
     <l n="29">A fragrance upon all who in her path</l>
     <l n="30">Have a blest fellowship . I longed to be</l>
     <l n="31">Her brother , that her hand might lie upon</l>
     <l n="32">My forehead , and her gentle voice allay</l>
     <l n="33">The fever that is at my heart sometimes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="34">There was a second sister who might witch</l>
     <l n="35">An angel from his hymn . I cannot tell</l>
     <l n="36">The secret of her beauty . It is more</l>
     <l n="37">Than her slight penciled lip , and her arch eye</l>
     <l n="38">Laughing beneath its lashes , as if life</l>
     <l n="39">Were nothing but a merry mask ; ‘ tis more</l>
     <l n="40">Than motion , though she moveth like a fay ;</l>
     <l n="41">Or music , though her voice is like a reed</l>
     <l n="42">Blown by a low south wind ; or cunning grace ,</l>
     <l n="43">Though all she does is beautiful ; or thought ,</l>
     <l n="44">Or fancy , or a delicate sense , though mind</l>
     <l n="45">Is her best gift , and poetry her world ,</l>
     <l n="46">And she will see strange beauty in a flower</l>
     <l n="47">As by a subtle vision . I care not</l>
     <l n="48">To know how she bewitches ; ‘ tis enough</l>
     <l n="49">For me that I can listen to her voice</l>
     <l n="50">And dream rare dreams of music , or converse</l>
     <l n="51">Upon unwrit philosophy , till I</l>
     <l n="52">Am wildered beneath thoughts I cannot bound</l>
     <l n="53">And the red lip that breathes them .</l>
     <l n="54">On my arm</l>
     <l n="55">Leaned an unshadowed girl , who scarcely yet</l>
     <l n="56">Had numbered fourteen summers . I know not</l>
     <l n="57">How I shall draw her picture — the young heart</l>
     <l n="58">Has such a restlessness of change , and each</l>
     <l n="59">Of its wild moods so lovely ! I can see</l>
     <l n="60">Her figure in its rounded beauty now ,</l>
     <l n="61">With her half-flying step , her clustering hair</l>
     <l n="62">Bathing a neck like Hebe 's , and her face</l>
     <l n="63">By a glad heart made radiant . She was full</l>
     <l n="64">Of the romance of girlhood . The fair world</l>
     <l n="65">Was like an unmarred Eden to her eye ,</l>
     <l n="66">And every sound was music , and the tint</l>
     <l n="67">Of every cloud a silent poetry .</l>
     <l n="68">Light to thy path , bright creature ! I would charm</l>
     <l n="69">Thy being if I could , that it should be</l>
     <l n="70">Ever as now thou dreamest , and flow on</l>
     <l n="71">Thus innocent and beautiful to heaven !</l>
     <l n="72">We walked beneath the full and mellow moon</l>
     <l n="73">Till the late stars had risen . It was not</l>
     <l n="74">In silence , though we did not seem to break</l>
     <l n="75">The hush with our low voices ; but our thoughts</l>
     <l n="76">Stirred deeply at their sources ; and when night</l>
     <l n="77">Divided us , I slumbered with a peace</l>
     <l n="78">Floating about my heart , which only comes</l>
     <l n="79">From high communion . I shall never see</l>
     <l n="80">That silver moon again without a crowd</l>
     <l n="81">Of gentle memories , and a silent prayer ,</l>
     <l n="82">That when the night of life shall oversteal</l>
     <l n="83">Your sky , ye lovely sisters ! there may be</l>
     <l n="84">A light as beautiful to lead you on .</l>

     <l n="1">Fleetly hath past the year . The seasons came</l>
     <l n="2">Duly as they are wont — the gentle Spring ,</l>
     <l n="3">And the delicious Summer , and the cool ,</l>
     <l n="4">Rich Autumn , with the nodding of the grain ,</l>
     <l n="5">And Winter , like an old and hoary man ,</l>
     <l n="6">Frosty and stiff — and so are chronicled .</l>
     <l n="7">We have read gladness in the new green leaf ,</l>
     <l n="8">And in the first blown violets ; we have drunk</l>
     <l n="9">Cool water from the rock , and in the shade</l>
     <l n="10">Sunk to the noon-tide slumber ;— we have eat</l>
     <l n="11">The mellow fruitage of the bending tree ,</l>
     <l n="12">And girded to our pleasant wanderings</l>
     <l n="13">When the cool wind came freshly from the hills ;</l>
     <l n="14">And when the tinting of the Autumn leaves</l>
     <l n="15">Had faded from its glory , we have sat</l>
     <l n="16">By the good fires of Winter , and rejoiced</l>
     <l n="17">Over the fulness of the gathered sheaf .</l>
     <l n="18">“ God hath been very good ! ” ‘ Tis He whose hand</l>
     <l n="19">Moulded the sunny hills , and hollowed out</l>
     <l n="20">The shelter of the valleys , and doth keep</l>
     <l n="21">The fountains in their secret places cool ;</l>
     <l n="22">And it is He who leadeth up the sun ,</l>
     <l n="23">And ordereth the starry influences ,</l>
     <l n="24">And tempereth the keenness of the frost —</l>
     <l n="25">And therefore , in the plenty of the feast ,</l>
     <l n="26">And in the lifting of the cup , let HIM</l>
     <l n="27">Have praises for the well-completed year .</l>

    <head>JANUARY 1 , 1829 .</head>
     <l n="1">Winter is come again . The sweet south west</l>
     <l n="2">Is a forgotten wind , and the strong earth</l>
     <l n="3">Has laid aside its mantle to be bound</l>
     <l n="4">By the frost fetter . There is not a sound</l>
     <l n="5">Save of the skaiter 's heel , and there is laid</l>
     <l n="6">An icy finger on the lip of streams ,</l>
     <l n="7">And the clear icicle hangs cold and still ,</l>
     <l n="8">And the snow-fall is noiseless as a thought .</l>
     <l n="9">Spring has a rushing sound , and Summer sends</l>
     <l n="10">Many sweet voices with its odors out ,</l>
     <l n="11">And Autumn rustleth its decaying robe</l>
     <l n="12">With a complaining whisper . Winter 's dumb !</l>
     <l n="13">God made his ministry a silent one ,</l>
     <l n="14">And he has given him a foot of steel</l>
     <l n="15">And an unlovely aspect , and a breath</l>
     <l n="16">Sharp to the senses — and we know that He</l>
     <l n="17">Tempereth well , and hath a meaning hid</l>
     <l n="18">Under the shadow of his hand . Look up !</l>
     <l n="19">And it shall be interpreted — Your home</l>
     <l n="20">Hath a temptation now . There is no voice</l>
     <l n="21">Of waters with beguiling for your ear ,</l>
     <l n="22">And the cool forest and the meadows green</l>
     <l n="23">Witch not your feet away ; and in the dells</l>
     <l n="24">There are no violets , and upon the hills</l>
     <l n="25">There are no sunny places to lie down .</l>
     <l n="26">You must go in , and by your cheerful fire</l>
     <l n="27">Wait for the offices of love , and hear</l>
     <l n="28">Accents of human tenderness , and feast</l>
     <l n="29">Your eye upon the beauty of the young .</l>
     <l n="30">It is a season for the quiet thought ,</l>
     <l n="31">And the still reckoning with thyself . The year</l>
     <l n="32">Gives back the spirits of its dead , and time</l>
     <l n="33">Whispers the history of its vanished hours ;</l>
     <l n="34">And the heart , calling its affections up ,</l>
     <l n="35">Counteth its wasted ingots . Life stands still</l>
     <l n="36">And settles like a fountain , and the eye</l>
     <l n="37">Sees clearly through its depths , and noteth all</l>
     <l n="38">That stirred its troubled waters . It is well</l>
     <l n="39">That Winter with the dying year should come !</l>

     <l n="1">Lift up thine eyes , sweet Psyche ! What is she</l>
     <l n="2">That those soft fringes timidly should fall</l>
     <l n="3">Before her , and thy spiritual brow</l>
     <l n="4">Be shadowed as her presence were a cloud ?</l>
     <l n="5">A loftier gift is thine than she can give —</l>
     <l n="6">That queen of beauty . She may mould the brow</l>
     <l n="7">To perfectness , and give unto the form</l>
     <l n="8">A beautiful proportion ; she may stain</l>
     <l n="9">The eye with a celestial blue — the cheek</l>
     <l n="10">With carmine of the sunset ; she may breathe</l>
     <l n="11">Grace into every motion , like the play</l>
     <l n="12">Of the least visible tissue of a cloud ;</l>
     <l n="13">She may give all that is within her own</l>
     <l n="14">Bright cestus — and one silent look of thine ,</l>

     <l n="19">Or color , but the beautiful links that chain</l>
     <l n="20">The mind from its rare element ? There lies</l>
     <l n="21">A talisman in intellect which yields</l>
     <l n="22">Celestial music , when the master hand</l>
     <l n="23">Touches it cunningly . It sleeps beneath</l>
     <l n="24">The outward semblance , and to common sight</l>
     <l n="25">Is an invisible and hidden thing ;</l>
     <l n="26">But when the lip is faded , and the cheek</l>
     <l n="27">Robbed of its daintiness , and when the form</l>
     <l n="28">Witches the sense no more , and human love</l>
     <l n="29">Falters in its idolatry , this spell</l>
     <l n="30">Will hold its strength unbroken , and go on</l>
     <l n="31">Stealing anew the affections .</l>
     <l n="32">Marvel not</l>
     <l n="33">That Love leans sadly on his bended bow .</l>
     <l n="34">He hath found out the loveliness of mind ,</l>
     <l n="35">And he is spoilt for beauty . So ‘ twill be</l>
     <l n="36">Ever — the glory of the human form</l>
     <l n="37">Is but a perishing thing , and Love will droop</l>
     <l n="38">When its brief grace hath faded ; but the mind</l>
     <l n="39">Perisheth not , and when the outward charm</l>
     <l n="40">Hath had its brief existence , it awakes ,</l>
     <l n="41">And is the lovelier that it slept so long —</l>
     <l n="42">Like wells that by the wasting of their flow</l>
     <l n="43">Have had their deeper fountains broken up .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Down the green slope he bounded . Raven curls</l>
     <l n="2">From his white shoulders by the winds were swept ,</l>
     <l n="3">And the clear color of his sunny cheek</l>
     <l n="4">Was bright with motion . Through his open lips</l>
     <l n="5">Shone visibly a delicate line of pearl ,</l>
     <l n="6">Like a white vein within a rosy shell ,</l>
     <l n="7">And his dark eye 's clear brilliance , as it lay</l>
     <l n="8">Beneath his lashes , like a drop of dew</l>
     <l n="9">Hid in the moss , stole out as covertly</l>
     <l n="10">As starlight from the edging of a cloud .</l>
     <l n="11">I never saw a boy so beautiful .</l>
     <l n="12">His step was like the stooping of a bird ,</l>
     <l n="13">And his limbs melted into grace like things</l>
     <l n="14">Shaped by the wind of summer . He was like</l>
     <l n="15">A painter 's fine conception — such an one</l>
     <l n="16">As he would have of Ganymede , and weep</l>
     <l n="17">Upon his pallet that he could not win</l>
     <l n="18">The vision to his easel . Who could paint</l>
     <l n="19">The young and shadowless spirit ? Who could chain</l>
     <l n="20">The visible gladness of a heart that lives ,</l>
     <l n="21">Like a glad fountain , in the eye of light ,</l>
     <l n="22">With an unbreathing pencil ? Nature 's gift</l>
     <l n="23">Has nothing that is like it . Sun and stream ,</l>
     <l n="24">And the new leaves of June , and the young lark</l>
     <l n="25">That flees away into the depths of heaven ,</l>
     <l n="26">Lost in his own wild music , and the breath</l>
     <l n="27">Of springtime , and the summer eve , and noon</l>
     <l n="28">In the cool autumn , are like fingers swept</l>
     <l n="29">Over sweet-toned affections — but the joy</l>
     <l n="30">That enters to the spirit of a child</l>
     <l n="31">Is deep as his young heart : his very breath ,</l>
     <l n="32">The simple sense of being , is enough</l>
     <l n="33">To ravish him , and like a thrilling touch</l>
     <l n="34">He feels each moment of his life go by .</l>

     <l n="38">Of the immortal flower that will unfold</l>
     <l n="39">And come to its maturity in heaven !</l>
     <l n="40">I weep your earthly glory . ‘ Tis a light</l>
     <l n="41">Lent to the new born spirit that goes out</l>
     <l n="42">With the first idle wind . It is the leaf</l>
     <l n="43">Fresh flung upon the river , that will dance</l>
     <l n="44">Upon the wave that stealeth out its life ,</l>
     <l n="45">Then sink of its own heaviness . The face</l>
     <l n="46">Of the delightful earth will to your eye</l>
     <l n="47">Grow dim ; the fragrance of the many flowers</l>
     <l n="48">Be noticed not , and the beguiling voice</l>
     <l n="49">Of nature in her gentleness will be</l>
     <l n="50">To manhood 's senseless ear inaudible .</l>

     <l n="18">As if a pleasant thought were at her heart .</l>
     <l n="19">Presently , in the edge of the last tint</l>
     <l n="20">Of sunset , where the blue was melted in</l>
     <l n="21">To the faint golden mellowness , a star</l>
     <l n="22">Stood suddenly . A laugh of wild delight</l>
     <l n="23">Burst from her lips , and putting up her hands ,</l>
     <l n="24">Her simple thought broke forth expressively —</l>
     <l n="25">“ Father ! dear Father ! God has made a star ! ”</l>

     <l n="27">I love to go in the capricious days</l>
     <l n="28">Of April and hunt violets ; when the rain</l>
     <l n="29">Is in the blue cups trembling , and they nod</l>

     <l n="31">It may be deem 'd unmanly , but the wise</l>
     <l n="32">Read nature like the manuscript of heaven</l>
     <l n="33">And call the flowers its poetry . Go out !</l>
     <l n="34">Ye spirits of habitual unrest ,</l>
     <l n="35">And read it when the “ fever of the world ”</l>
     <l n="36">Hath made your hearts impatient , and , if life</l>
     <l n="37">Hath yet one spring unpoison 'd , it will be</l>
     <l n="38">Like a beguiling music to its flow ,</l>

     <l n="5">And bathe her neck — and shade the bright</l>
     <l n="6">Dark eye from which they catch the light ,</l>

     <l n="38">Of that calm look , and measur 'd smile ,</l>
     <l n="39">I go away like one who 's heard</l>
     <l n="40">In some fine scene the prompter 's word ,</l>
