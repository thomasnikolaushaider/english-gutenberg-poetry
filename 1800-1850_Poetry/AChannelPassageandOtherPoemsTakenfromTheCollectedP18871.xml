    <head>A CHANNEL PASSAGE</head>
     <l n="1">1855</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Forth from Calais , at dawn of night , when sunset summer on autumn shone , Fared the steamer alert and loud through seas whence only the sun was gone : Soft and sweet as the sky they smiled , and bade man welcome : a dim sweet hour Gleamed and whispered in wind and sea , and heaven was fair as a field in flower . Stars fulfilled the desire of the darkling world as with music : the starbright air Made the face of the sea , if aught may make the face of the sea , more fair .</p>
   <p>Whence came change ? Was the sweet night weary of rest ? What anguish awoke in the dark ? Sudden , sublime , the strong storm spake : we heard the thunders as hounds that bark . Lovelier if aught may be lovelier than stars , we saw the lightnings exalt the sky , Living and lustrous and rapturous as love that is born but to quicken and lighten and die . Heaven 's own heart at its highest of delight found utterance in music and semblance in fire : Thunder on thunder exulted , rejoicing to live and to satiate the night 's desire .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And the night was alive and anhungered of life as a tiger from</l>
     <l n="2">toils cast free :</l>
     <l n="3">And a rapture of rage made joyous the spirit and strength of the</l>
     <l n="4">soul of the sea .</l>
     <l n="5">All the weight of the wind bore down on it , freighted with death</l>
     <l n="6">for fraught :</l>
     <l n="7">And the keen waves kindled and quickened as things transfigured or</l>
     <l n="8">things distraught .</l>
     <l n="9">And madness fell on them laughing and leaping ; and madness came on</l>
     <l n="10">the wind :</l>
     <l n="11">And the might and the light and the darkness of storm were as storm</l>
     <l n="12">in the heart of Ind .</l>
     <l n="13">Such glory , such terror , such passion , as lighten and harrow the</l>
     <l n="14">far fierce East ,</l>
     <l n="15">Rang , shone , spake , shuddered around us : the night was an altar</l>
     <l n="16">with death for priest .</l>
     <l n="17">The channel that sunders England from shores where never was man</l>
     <l n="18">born free</l>
     <l n="19">Was clothed with the likeness and thrilled with the strength and</l>
     <l n="20">the wrath of a tropic sea .</l>
     <l n="21">As a wild steed ramps in rebellion , and rears till it swerves from</l>
     <l n="22">a backward fall ,</l>
     <l n="23">The strong ship struggled and reared , and her deck was upright as a</l>
     <l n="24">sheer cliff 's wall .</l>
     <l n="25">Stern and prow plunged under , alternate : a glimpse , a recoil , a</l>
     <l n="26">breath ,</l>
     <l n="27">And she sprang as the life in a god made man would spring at the</l>
     <l n="28">throat of death .</l>
     <l n="29">Three glad hours , and it seemed not an hour of supreme and supernal</l>
     <l n="30">joy ,</l>
     <l n="31">Filled full with delight that revives in remembrance a sea-bird 's</l>
     <l n="32">heart in a boy .</l>
     <l n="33">For the central crest of the night was cloud that thundered and</l>
     <l n="34">flamed , sublime</l>
     <l n="35">As the splendour and song of the soul everlasting that quickens the</l>
     <l n="36">pulse of time .</l>
     <l n="37">The glory beholden of man in a vision , the music of light</l>
     <l n="38">overheard ,</l>
     <l n="39">The rapture and radiance of battle , the life that abides in the</l>
     <l n="40">fire of a word ,</l>
     <l n="41">In the midmost heaven enkindled , was manifest far on the face of</l>
     <l n="42">the sea ,</l>
     <l n="43">And the rage in the roar of the voice of the waters was heard but</l>
     <l n="44">when heaven breathed free .</l>
     <l n="45">Far eastward , clear of the covering of cloud , the sky laughed out</l>
     <l n="46">into light</l>
     <l n="47">From the rims of the storm to the sea 's dark edge with flames that</l>
     <l n="48">were flowerlike and white .</l>
     <l n="49">The leaping and luminous blossoms of live sheet lightning that</l>
     <l n="50">laugh as they fade</l>
     <l n="51">From the cloud 's black base to the black wave 's brim rejoiced in</l>
     <l n="52">the light they made .</l>
     <l n="53">Far westward , throned in a silent sky , where life was in lustrous</l>
     <l n="54">tune ,</l>
     <l n="55">Shone , sweeter and surer than morning or evening , the steadfast</l>
     <l n="56">smile of the moon .</l>
     <l n="57">The limitless heaven that enshrined them was lovelier than dreams</l>
     <l n="58">may behold , and deep</l>
     <l n="59">As life or as death , revealed and transfigured , may shine on the</l>
     <l n="60">soul through sleep .</l>
     <l n="61">All glories of toil and of triumph and passion and pride that it</l>
     <l n="62">yearns to know</l>
     <l n="63">Bore witness there to the soul of its likeness and kinship , above</l>
     <l n="64">and below .</l>
     <l n="65">The joys of the lightnings , the songs of the thunders , the strong</l>
     <l n="66">sea 's labour and rage ,</l>
     <l n="67">Were tokens and signs of the war that is life and is joy for the</l>
     <l n="68">soul to wage .</l>
     <l n="69">No thought strikes deeper or higher than the heights and the depths</l>
     <l n="70">that the night made bare ,</l>
     <l n="71">Illimitable , infinite , awful and joyful , alive in the summit of</l>
     <l n="72">air —</l>
     <l n="73">Air stilled and thrilled by the tempest that thundered between its</l>
     <l n="74">reign and the sea 's ,</l>
     <l n="75">Rebellious , rapturous , and transient as faith or as terror that</l>
     <l n="76">bows men 's knees .</l>
     <l n="77">No love sees loftier and fairer the form of its godlike vision in</l>
     <l n="78">dreams</l>
     <l n="79">Than the world shone then , when the sky and the sea were as love</l>
     <l n="80">for a breath 's length seems —</l>
     <l n="81">One utterly , mingled and mastering and mastered and laughing with</l>
     <l n="82">love that subsides</l>
     <l n="83">As the glad mad night sank panting and satiate with storm , and</l>
     <l n="84">released the tides .</l>
     <l n="85">In the dense mid channel the steam-souled ship hung hovering ,</l>
     <l n="86">assailed and withheld</l>
     <l n="87">As a soul born royal , if life or if death be against it , is</l>
     <l n="88">thwarted and quelled .</l>
     <l n="89">As the glories of myriads of glowworms in lustrous grass on a</l>
     <l n="90">boundless lawn</l>
     <l n="91">Were the glories of flames phosphoric that made of the water a</l>
     <l n="92">light like dawn .</l>
     <l n="93">A thousand Phosphors , a thousand Hespers , awoke in the churning</l>
     <l n="94">sea ,</l>
     <l n="95">And the swift soft hiss of them living and dying was clear as a</l>
     <l n="96">tune could be ;</l>
     <l n="97">As a tune that is played by the fingers of death on the keys of</l>
     <l n="98">life or of sleep ,</l>
     <l n="99">Audible alway alive in the storm , too fleet for a dream to keep :</l>
     <l n="100">Too fleet , too sweet for a dream to recover and thought to remember</l>
     <l n="101">awake :</l>
     <l n="102">Light subtler and swifter than lightning , that whispers and laughs</l>
     <l n="103">in the live storm 's wake ,</l>
     <l n="104">In the wild bright wake of the storm , in the dense loud heart of</l>
     <l n="105">the labouring hour ,</l>
     <l n="106">A harvest of stars by the storm 's hand reaped , each fair as a</l>
     <l n="107">star-shaped flower .</l>
     <l n="108">And sudden and soft as the passing of sleep is the passing of</l>
     <l n="109">tempest seemed</l>
     <l n="110">When the light and the sound of it sank , and the glory was gone as</l>
     <l n="111">a dream half dreamed .</l>
     <l n="112">The glory , the terror , the passion that made of the midnight a</l>
     <l n="113">miracle , died ,</l>
     <l n="114">Not slain at a stroke , nor in gradual reluctance abated of power</l>
     <l n="115">and of pride ;</l>
     <l n="116">With strong swift subsidence , awful as power that is wearied of</l>
     <l n="117">power upon earth ,</l>
     <l n="118">As a God that were wearied of power upon heaven , and were fain of a</l>
     <l n="119">new God 's birth ,</l>
     <l n="120">The might of the night subsided : the tyranny kindled in darkness</l>
     <l n="121">fell :</l>
     <l n="122">And the sea and the sky put off them the rapture and radiance of</l>
     <l n="123">heaven and of hell .</l>
     <l n="124">The waters , heaving and hungering at heart , made way , and were</l>
     <l n="125">wellnigh fain ,</l>
     <l n="126">For the ship that had fought them , and wrestled , and revelled in</l>
     <l n="127">labour , to cease from her pain .</l>
     <l n="128">And an end was made of it : only remembrance endures of the glad</l>
     <l n="129">loud strife ;</l>
     <l n="130">And the sense that a rapture so royal may come not again in the</l>
     <l n="131">passage of life .</l>

    <head>THE LAKE OF GAUBE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The sun is lord and god , sublime , serene ,</l>
     <l n="2">And sovereign on the mountains : earth and air</l>
     <l n="3">Lie prone in passion , blind with bliss unseen</l>
     <l n="4">By force of sight and might of rapture , fair</l>
     <l n="5">As dreams that die and know not what they were .</l>
     <l n="6">The lawns , the gorges , and the peaks , are one</l>
     <l n="7">Glad glory , thrilled with sense of unison</l>
     <l n="8">In strong compulsive silence of the sun .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Flowers dense and keen as midnight stars aflame</l>
     <l n="10">And living things of light like flames in flower</l>
     <l n="11">That glance and flash as though no hand might tame</l>
     <l n="12">Lightnings whose life outshone their stormlit hour</l>
     <l n="13">And played and laughed on earth , with all their power</l>
     <l n="14">Gone , and with all their joy of life made long</l>
     <l n="15">And harmless as the lightning life of song ,</l>
     <l n="16">Shine sweet like stars when darkness feels them strong .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">The deep mild purple flaked with moonbright gold</l>
     <l n="18">That makes the scales seem flowers of hardened light ,</l>
     <l n="19">The flamelike tongue , the feet that noon leaves cold ,</l>
     <l n="20">The kindly trust in man , when once the sight</l>
     <l n="21">Grew less than strange , and faith bade fear take flight ,</l>
     <l n="22">Outlive the little harmless life that shone</l>
     <l n="23">And gladdened eyes that loved it , and was gone</l>
     <l n="24">Ere love might fear that fear had looked thereon .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">Fear held the bright thing hateful , even as fear ,</l>
     <l n="26">Whose name is one with hate and horror , saith</l>
     <l n="27">That heaven , the dark deep heaven of water near ,</l>
     <l n="28">Is deadly deep as hell and dark as death .</l>
     <l n="29">The rapturous plunge that quickens blood and breath</l>
     <l n="30">With pause more sweet than passion , ere they strive</l>
     <l n="31">To raise again the limbs that yet would dive</l>
     <l n="32">Deeper , should there have slain the soul alive .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>As the bright salamander in fire of the noonshine exults and is glad of his day , The spirit that quickens my body rejoices to pass from the sunlight away , To pass from the glow of the mountainous flowerage , the high multitudinous bloom , Far down through the fathomless night of the water , the gladness of silence and gloom . Death-dark and delicious as death in the dream of a lover and dreamer may be , It clasps and encompasses body and soul with delight to be living and free : Free utterly now , though the freedom endure but the space of a perilous breath , And living , though girdled about with the darkness and coldness and strangeness of death : Each limb and each pulse of the body rejoicing , each nerve of the spirit at rest , All sense of the soul 's life rapture , a passionate peace in its blindness blest . So plunges the downward swimmer , embraced of the water unfathomed of man , The darkness unplummeted , icier than seas in midwinter , for blessing or ban ; And swiftly and sweetly , when strength and breath fall short , and the dive is done , Shoots up as a shaft from the dark depth shot , sped straight into sight of the sun ; And sheer through the snow-soft water , more dark than the roof of the pines above , Strikes forth , and is glad as a bird whose flight is impelled and sustained of love . As a sea-mew 's love of the sea-wind breasted and ridden for rapture 's sake Is the love of his body and soul for the darkling delight of the soundless lake : As the silent speed of a dream too living to live for a thought 's space more Is the flight of his limbs through the still strong chill of the darkness from shore to shore . Might life be as this is and death be as life that casts off time as a robe , The likeness of infinite heaven were a symbol revealed of the lake of Gaube .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Whose thought has fathomed and measured</l>
     <l n="2">The darkness of life and of death ,</l>
     <l n="3">The secret within them treasured ,</l>
     <l n="4">The spirit that is not breath ?</l>
     <l n="5">Whose vision has yet beholden</l>
     <l n="6">The splendour of death and of life ?</l>
     <l n="7">Though sunset as dawn be golden ,</l>
     <l n="8">Is the word of them peace , not strife ?</l>
     <l n="9">Deep silence answers : the glory</l>
     <l n="10">We dream of may be but a dream ,</l>
     <l n="11">And the sun of the soul wax hoary</l>
     <l n="12">As ashes that show not a gleam .</l>
     <l n="13">But well shall it be with us ever</l>
     <l n="14">Who drive through the darkness here ,</l>
     <l n="15">If the soul that we live by never ,</l>
     <l n="16">For aught that a lie saith , fear .</l>

    <head>THE PROMISE OF THE HAWTHORN</head>
     <l n="1">Spring sleeps and stirs and trembles with desire</l>
     <l n="2">Pure as a babe 's that nestles toward the breast .</l>
     <l n="3">The world , as yet an all unstricken lyre ,</l>
     <l n="4">With all its chords alive and all at rest ,</l>
     <l n="5">Feels not the sun 's hand yet , but feels his breath</l>
     <l n="6">And yearns for love made perfect . Man and bird ,</l>
     <l n="7">Thrilled through with hope of life that casts out death ,</l>
     <l n="8">Wait with a rapturous patience till his word</l>
     <l n="9">Speak heaven , and flower by flower and tree by tree</l>
     <l n="10">Give back the silent strenuous utterance . Earth ,</l>
     <l n="11">Alive awhile and joyful as the sea ,</l>
     <l n="12">Laughs not aloud in joy too deep for mirth ,</l>
     <l n="13">Presageful of perfection of delight ,</l>
     <l n="14">Till all the unborn green buds be born in white .</l>

      <l n="1">Light and night , whose clouds and glories change and mingle and</l>
      <l n="2">divide ,</l>
      <l n="3">Veil the truth whereof they witness , show the truth of things</l>
      <l n="4">they hide .</l>
      <l n="5">Through the darkness and the splendour of the centuries , loud or</l>
      <l n="6">dumb ,</l>
      <l n="7">Shines and wanes and shines the spirit , lit with love of life to</l>
      <l n="8">come .</l>
      <l n="9">Man , the soul made flesh , that knows not death from life , and</l>
      <l n="10">fain would know ,</l>
      <l n="11">Sees the face of time change colour as its tides recoil and flow .</l>
      <l n="12">All his hope and fear and faith and doubt , if aught at all they</l>
      <l n="13">be ,</l>
      <l n="14">Live the life of clouds and sunbeams , born of heaven or earth or</l>
      <l n="15">sea .</l>
      <l n="16">All are buoyed and blown and brightened by their hour 's evasive</l>
      <l n="17">breath :</l>
      <l n="18">All subside and quail and darken when their hour is done to</l>
      <l n="19">death .</l>
      <l n="20">Yet , ere faith , a wandering water , froze and curdled into creeds ,</l>
      <l n="21">Earth , elate as heaven , adored the light that quickens dreams to</l>
      <l n="22">deeds .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Invisible : eye hath not seen it , and ear hath not heard as the spirit hath heard From the shrine that is lit not of sunlight or starlight the sound of a limitless word . And visible : none that hath eyes to behold what the spirit must perish or see Can choose but behold it and worship : a shrine that if light were as darkness would be . Of cloud and of change is the form of the fashion that man may behold of it wrought : Of iron and truth is the mystic mid altar , where worship is none but of thought . No prayer may go up to it , climbing as incense of gladness or sorrow may climb : No rapture of music may ruffle the silence that guards it , and hears not of time . As the winds of the wild blind ages alternate in passion of light and of cloud , So changes the shape of the veil that enshrouds it with darkness and light for a shroud . And the winds and the clouds and the suns fall silent , and fade out of hearing or sight , And the shrine stands fast and is changed not , whose likeness was changed as a cloud in the night .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">All the storms of time , and wrath of many winds , may carve no</l>
     <l n="2">trace</l>
     <l n="3">On the viewless altar , though the veil bear many a name and face :</l>
     <l n="4">Many a live God 's likeness woven , many a scripture dark with awe ,</l>
     <l n="5">Bids the veil seem verier iron than the word of life 's own law .</l>
     <l n="6">Till the might of change hath rent it with a rushing wind in</l>
     <l n="7">twain ,</l>
     <l n="8">Stone or steel it seems , whereon the wrath of chance is wreaked</l>
     <l n="9">in vain :</l>
     <l n="10">Stone or steel , and all behind it or beyond its lifted sign</l>
     <l n="11">Cloud and vapour , no subsistence of a change-unstricken shrine .</l>
     <l n="12">God by god flits past in thunder , till his glories turn to</l>
     <l n="13">shades :</l>
     <l n="14">God to god bears wondering witness how his gospel flames and</l>
     <l n="15">fades .</l>
     <l n="16">More was each of these , while yet they were , than man their</l>
     <l n="17">servant seemed :</l>
     <l n="18">Dead are all of these , and man survives who made them while he</l>
     <l n="19">dreamed .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Yet haply or surely , if vision were surer than theirs who rejoiced that they saw , Man might not but see , through the darkness of godhead , the light that is surety and law . On the stone that the close-drawn cloud which veils it awhile makes cloudlike stands The word of the truth everlasting , unspoken of tongues and unwritten of hands . By the sunbeams and storms of the centuries engraven , and approved of the soul as it reads , It endures as a token dividing the light from the darkness of dreams and of deeds . The faces of gods on the face of it carven , or gleaming behind and above , Star-glorified Uranus , thunderous Jehovah , for terror or worship or love , Change , wither , and brighten as flowers that the wind of eternity sheds upon time , All radiant and transient and awful and mortal , and leave it unmarred and sublime . As the tides that return and recede are the fears and the hopes of the centuries that roll , Requenched and rekindled : but strong as the sun is the sense of it shrined in the soul .</p>

     <l n="1">In the days when time was not , in the time when days were none ,</l>
     <l n="2">Ere sorrow had life to lot , ere earth gave thanks for the sun ,</l>
     <l n="3">Ere man in his darkness waking adored what the soul in him could ,</l>
     <l n="4">And the manifold God of his making was manifest evil and good ,</l>
     <l n="5">One law from the dim beginning abode and abides in the end ,</l>
     <l n="6">In sight of him sorrowing and sinning with none but his faith for</l>
     <l n="7">friend .</l>
     <l n="8">Dark were the shadows around him , and darker the glories above ,</l>
     <l n="9">Ere light from beyond them found him , and bade him for love 's sake</l>
     <l n="10">love .</l>
     <l n="11">About him was darkness , and under and over him darkness : the night</l>
     <l n="12">That conceived him and bore him had thunder for utterance and</l>
     <l n="13">lightning for light .</l>
     <l n="14">The dust of death was the dust of the ways that the tribes of him</l>
     <l n="15">trod :</l>
     <l n="16">And he knew not if just or unjust were the might of the mystery of</l>
     <l n="17">God .</l>
     <l n="18">Strange horror and hope , strange faith and unfaith , were his boon</l>
     <l n="19">and his bane :</l>
     <l n="20">And the God of his trust was the wraith of the soul or the ghost of</l>
     <l n="21">it slain .</l>
     <l n="22">A curse was on death as on birth , and a Presence that shone as a</l>
     <l n="23">sword</l>
     <l n="24">Shed menace from heaven upon earth that beheld him , and hailed him</l>
     <l n="25">her Lord .</l>
     <l n="26">Sublime and triumphant as fire or as lightning , he kindled the</l>
     <l n="27">skies ,</l>
     <l n="28">And withered with dread the desire that would look on the light of</l>
     <l n="29">his eyes .</l>
     <l n="30">Earth shuddered with worship , and knew not if hell were not hot in</l>
     <l n="31">her breath ;</l>
     <l n="32">If birth were not sin , and the dew of the morning the sweat of her</l>
     <l n="33">death .</l>
     <l n="34">The watchwords of evil and good were unspoken of men and unheard :</l>
     <l n="35">They were shadows that willed as he would , that were made and</l>
     <l n="36">unmade by his word .</l>
     <l n="37">His word was darkness and light , and a wisdom that makes men mad</l>
     <l n="38">Sent blindness upon them for sight , that they saw but and heard as</l>
     <l n="39">he bade .</l>
     <l n="40">Cast forth and corrupt from the birth by the crime of creation ,</l>
     <l n="41">they stood</l>
     <l n="42">Convicted of evil on earth by the grace of a God found good .</l>
     <l n="43">The grace that enkindled and quickened the darkness of hell with</l>
     <l n="44">flame</l>
     <l n="45">Bade man , though the soul in him sickened , obey , and give praise to</l>
     <l n="46">his name .</l>
     <l n="47">The still small voice of the spirit whose life is as plague 's hot</l>

     <l n="72">The wastes of the wilderness brightened and trembled with rapture</l>
     <l n="73">and dread</l>

     <l n="82">The psalmist 's witness in token arose as the speech of a star .</l>
     <l n="83">Starlight supreme , and the tender desire of the moon , were as one</l>

    <head>FOR GREECE AND CRETE</head>
    <head>Storm and shame and fraud and darkness fill the nations full with night : Hope and fear whose eyes yearn eastward have but fire and sword in sight : One alone , whose name is one with glory , sees and seeks the light .</head>
     <l n="1">Hellas , mother of the spirit , sole supreme in war and peace ,</l>
     <l n="2">Land of light , whose word remembered bids all fear and sorrow</l>
     <l n="3">cease ,</l>
     <l n="4">Lives again , while freedom lightens eastward yet for sons of</l>
     <l n="5">Greece .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Greece , where only men whose manhood was as godhead ever trod , Bears the blind world witness yet of light wherewith her feet are shod : Freedom , armed of Greece was always very man and very God .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Now the winds of old that filled her sails with triumph , when the</l>
     <l n="2">fleet</l>
     <l n="3">Bound for death from Asia fled before them stricken , wake to greet</l>
     <l n="4">Ships full-winged again for freedom toward the sacred shores of</l>
     <l n="5">Crete .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>There was God born man , the song that spake of old time said : and there Man , made even as God by trust that shows him nought too dire to dare , Now may light again the beacon lit when those we worship were .</p>
   <p>Sharp the concert wrought of discord shrills the tune of shame and death , Turk by Christian fenced and fostered , Mecca backed by Nazareth : All the powerless powers , tongue-valiant , breathe but greed 's or terror 's breath .</p>
   <p>Though the tide that feels the west wind lift it wave by widening wave Wax not yet to height and fullness of the storm that smites to save , None shall bid the flood back seaward till no bar be left to brave .</p>

     <l n="1">Light , as when dawn takes wing and smites the sea ,</l>
     <l n="2">Smote England when his day bade Marlowe be .</l>
     <l n="3">No fire so keen had thrilled the clouds of time</l>
     <l n="4">Since Dante 's breath made Italy sublime .</l>
     <l n="5">Earth , bright with flowers whose dew shone soft as tears ,</l>
     <l n="6">Through Chaucer cast her charm on eyes and ears :</l>
     <l n="7">The lustrous laughter of the love-lit earth</l>
     <l n="8">Rang , leapt , and lightened in his might of mirth .</l>
     <l n="9">Deep moonlight , hallowing all the breathless air ,</l>
     <l n="10">Made earth and heaven for Spenser faint and fair .</l>
     <l n="11">But song might bid not heaven and earth be one</l>
     <l n="12">Till Marlowe 's voice gave warning of the sun .</l>
     <l n="13">Thought quailed and fluttered as a wounded bird</l>
     <l n="14">Till passion fledged the wing of Marlowe 's word .</l>
     <l n="15">Faith born of fear bade hope and doubt be dumb</l>
     <l n="16">Till Marlowe 's pride bade light or darkness come .</l>
     <l n="17">Then first our speech was thunder : then our song</l>
     <l n="18">Shot lightning through the clouds that wrought us wrong .</l>
     <l n="19">Blind fear , whose faith feeds hell with fire , became</l>
     <l n="20">A moth self-shrivelled in its own blind flame .</l>
     <l n="21">We heard , in tune with even our seas that roll ,</l>
     <l n="22">The speech of storm , the thunders of the soul .</l>
     <l n="23">Men 's passions , clothed with all the woes they wrought ,</l>
     <l n="24">Shone through the fire of man 's transfiguring thought .</l>
     <l n="25">The thirst of knowledge , quenchless at her springs ,</l>
     <l n="26">Ambition , fire that clasps the thrones of kings ,</l>
     <l n="27">Love , light that makes of life one lustrous hour ,</l>
     <l n="28">And song , the soul 's chief crown and throne of power ,</l>
     <l n="29">The hungering heart of greed and ravenous hate ,</l>
     <l n="30">Made music high as heaven and deep as fate .</l>
     <l n="31">Strange pity , scarce half scornful of her tear ,</l>

     <l n="39">Eternal beauty , strong as day and night ,</l>
     <l n="40">Shone , when his word bade Helen back to sight .</l>
     <l n="41">Fear , when he bowed the soul before her spell ,</l>
     <l n="42">Thundered and lightened through the vaults of hell .</l>
     <l n="43">The music known of all men 's tongues that sing ,</l>
     <l n="44">When Marlowe sang , bade love make heaven of spring ;</l>
     <l n="45">The music none but English tongues may make ,</l>
     <l n="46">Our own sole song , spake first when Marlowe spake ;</l>

     <l n="18">Thrilled through with sense of instant life and death ,</l>
     <l n="19">Life actual even as theirs who watched the strife ,</l>
     <l n="20">Death dark and keen and terrible as life .</l>
     <l n="21">Here first was truth in song made perfect : here</l>
     <l n="22">Woke first the war of love and hate and fear .</l>
     <l n="23">A man too vile for thought 's or shame 's control</l>
     <l n="24">Holds empire on a woman 's loftier soul ,</l>
     <l n="25">And withers it to wickedness : in vain</l>
     <l n="26">Shame quickens thought with penitential pain :</l>
     <l n="27">In vain dark chance 's fitful providence</l>
     <l n="28">Withholds the crime , and chills the spirit of sense :</l>
     <l n="29">It wakes again in fire that burns away</l>
     <l n="30">Repentance , weak as night devoured of day .</l>
     <l n="31">Remorse , and ravenous thirst of sin and crime ,</l>
     <l n="32">Rend and consume the soul in strife sublime ,</l>
     <l n="33">And passion cries on pity till it hear</l>
     <l n="34">And tremble as with love that casts out fear .</l>
     <l n="35">Dark as the deed and doom he gave to fame</l>
     <l n="36">For ever lies the sovereign singer 's name .</l>
     <l n="37">Sovereign and regent on the soul he lives</l>
     <l n="38">While thought gives thanks for aught remembrance gives ,</l>

    <head>PROLOGUE TO A VERY WOMAN</head>
     <l n="1">Swift music made of passion 's changeful power ,</l>
     <l n="2">Sweet as the change that leaves the world in flower</l>
     <l n="3">When spring laughs winter down to deathward , rang</l>
     <l n="4">From grave and gracious lips that smiled and sang</l>
     <l n="5">When Massinger , too wise for kings to hear</l>
     <l n="6">And learn of him truth , wisdom , faith , or fear ,</l>
     <l n="7">Gave all his gentler heart to love 's light lore ,</l>
     <l n="8">That grief might brood and scorn breed wrath no more .</l>
     <l n="9">Soft , bright , fierce , tender , fitful , truthful , sweet ,</l>
     <l n="10">A shrine where faith and change might smile and meet ,</l>
     <l n="11">A soul whose music could but shift its tune</l>
     <l n="12">As when the lustrous year turns May to June</l>
     <l n="13">And spring subsides in summer , so makes good</l>
     <l n="14">Its perfect claim to very womanhood .</l>
     <l n="15">The heart that hate of wrong made fire , the hand</l>
     <l n="16">Whose touch was fire as keen as shame 's own brand</l>
     <l n="17">When fraud and treason , swift to smile and sting ,</l>
     <l n="18">Crowned and discrowned a tyrant , knave or king ,</l>
     <l n="19">False each and ravenous as the fitful sea ,</l>
     <l n="20">Grew gently glad as love that fear sets free .</l>
     <l n="21">Like eddying ripples that the wind restrains ,</l>
     <l n="22">The bright words whisper music ere it wanes .</l>
     <l n="23">Ere fades the sovereign sound of song that rang</l>
     <l n="24">As though the sun to match the sea 's tune sang ,</l>
     <l n="25">When noon from dawn took life and light , and time</l>
     <l n="26">Shone , seeing how Shakespeare made the world sublime ,</l>
     <l n="27">Ere sinks the wind whose breath was heaven 's and day 's ,</l>
     <l n="28">The sunset 's witness gives the sundawn praise .</l>

    <head>PROLOGUE TO THE SPANISH GIPSY</head>
     <l n="1">The wind that brings us from the springtide south</l>
     <l n="2">Strange music as from love 's or life 's own mouth</l>
     <l n="3">Blew hither , when the blast of battle ceased</l>
     <l n="4">That swept back southward Spanish prince and priest ,</l>
     <l n="5">A sound more sweet than April 's flower-sweet rain ,</l>
     <l n="6">And bade bright England smile on pardoned Spain .</l>
     <l n="7">The land that cast out Philip and his God</l>
     <l n="8">Grew gladly subject where Cervantes trod .</l>
     <l n="9">Even he whose name above all names on earth</l>
     <l n="10">Crowns England queen by grace of Shakespeare 's birth</l>
     <l n="11">Might scarce have scorned to smile in God 's wise down</l>
     <l n="12">And gild with praise from heaven an earthlier crown .</l>
     <l n="13">And he whose hand bade live down lengthening years</l>
     <l n="14">Quixote , a name lit up with smiles and tears ,</l>
     <l n="15">Gave the glad watchword of the gipsies ’ life ,</l>
     <l n="16">Where fear took hope and grief took joy to wife .</l>
     <l n="17">Times change , and fame is fitful as the sea :</l>
     <l n="18">But sunset bids not darkness always be ,</l>
     <l n="19">And still some light from Shakespeare and the sun</l>
     <l n="20">Burns back the cloud that masks not Middleton .</l>
     <l n="21">With strong swift strokes of love and wrath he drew</l>
     <l n="22">Shakespearean London 's loud and lusty crew :</l>
     <l n="23">No plainer might the likeness rise and stand</l>
     <l n="24">When Hogarth took his living world in hand .</l>
     <l n="25">No surer then his fire-fledged shafts could hit ,</l>
     <l n="26">Winged with as forceful and as faithful wit :</l>
     <l n="27">No truer a tragic depth and heat of heart</l>
     <l n="28">Glowed through the painter 's than the poet 's art .</l>
     <l n="29">He lit and hung in heaven the wan fierce moon</l>
     <l n="30">Whose glance kept time with witchcraft 's air-struck tune :</l>
     <l n="31">He watched the doors where loveless love let in</l>
     <l n="32">The pageant hailed and crowned by death and sin :</l>
     <l n="33">He bared the souls where love , twin-born with hate ,</l>
     <l n="34">Made wide the way for passion-fostered fate .</l>
     <l n="35">All English-hearted , all his heart arose</l>
     <l n="36">To scourge with scorn his England 's cowering foes :</l>
     <l n="37">And Rome and Spain , who bade their scorner be</l>
     <l n="38">Their prisoner , left his heart as England 's free .</l>
     <l n="39">Now give we all we may of all his due</l>
     <l n="40">To one long since thus tried and found thus true .</l>

    <head>PROLOGUE TO THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN</head>
     <l n="1">Sweet as the dewfall , splendid as the south ,</l>
     <l n="2">Love touched with speech Boccaccio 's golden mouth ,</l>
     <l n="3">Joy thrilled and filled its utterance full with song ,</l>
     <l n="4">And sorrow smiled on doom that wrought no wrong .</l>
     <l n="5">A starrier lustre of lordlier music rose</l>
     <l n="6">Beyond the sundering bar of seas and snows</l>
     <l n="7">When Chaucer 's thought took life and light from his</l>
     <l n="8">And England 's crown was one with Italy 's .</l>
     <l n="9">Loftiest and last , by grace of Shakespeare 's word ,</l>
     <l n="10">Arose above their quiring spheres a third ,</l>
     <l n="11">Arose , and flashed , and faltered : song 's deep sky</l>
     <l n="12">Saw Shakespeare pass in light , in music die .</l>
     <l n="13">No light like his , no music , man might give</l>
     <l n="14">To bid the darkened sphere , left songless , live .</l>
     <l n="15">Soft though the sound of Fletcher 's rose and rang</l>
     <l n="16">And lit the lunar darkness as it sang ,</l>
     <l n="17">Below the singing stars the cloud-crossed moon</l>
     <l n="18">Gave back the sunken sun 's a trembling tune .</l>
     <l n="19">As when at highest high tide the sovereign sea</l>
     <l n="20">Pauses , and patience doubts if passion be ,</l>
     <l n="21">Till gradual ripples ebb , recede , recoil ,</l>
     <l n="22">Shine , smile , and whisper , laughing as they toil ,</l>
     <l n="23">Stark silence fell , at turn of fate 's high tide ,</l>
     <l n="24">Upon his broken song when Shakespeare died ,</l>
     <l n="25">Till Fletcher 's light sweet speech took heart to say</l>
     <l n="26">What evening , should it speak for morning , may .</l>
     <l n="27">And fourfold now the gradual glory shines</l>
     <l n="28">That shows once more in heaven two twinborn signs ,</l>
     <l n="29">Two brethren stars whose light no cloud may fret ,</l>
     <l n="30">No soul whereon their story dawns forget .</l>

    <head>THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE</head>
     <l n="1">Let there be light , said Time : and England heard :</l>
     <l n="2">And manhood grew to godhead at the word .</l>
     <l n="3">No light had shone , since earth arose from sleep ,</l>
     <l n="4">So far ; no fire of thought had cloven so deep .</l>
     <l n="5">A day beyond all days bade life acclaim</l>
     <l n="6">Shakespeare : and man put on his crowning name .</l>
     <l n="7">All secrets once through darkling ages kept</l>
     <l n="8">Shone , sang , and smiled to think how long they slept .</l>
     <l n="9">Man rose past fear of lies whereon he trod :</l>
     <l n="10">And Dante 's ghost saw hell devour his God .</l>
     <l n="11">Bright Marlowe , brave as winds that brave the sea</l>
     <l n="12">When sundawn bids their bliss in battle be ,</l>
     <l n="13">Lit England first along the ways whereon</l>
     <l n="14">Song brighter far than sunlight soared and shone .</l>
     <l n="15">He died ere half his life had earned his right</l>
     <l n="16">To lighten time with song 's triumphant light .</l>
     <l n="17">Hope shrank , and felt the stroke at heart : but one</l>
     <l n="18">She knew not rose , a man to match the sun .</l>
     <l n="19">And England 's hope and time 's and man 's became</l>
     <l n="20">Joy , deep as music 's heart and keen as flame .</l>
     <l n="21">Not long , for heaven on earth may live not long ,</l>
     <l n="22">Light sang , and darkness died before the song .</l>
     <l n="23">He passed , the man above all men , whose breath</l>
     <l n="24">Transfigured life with speech that lightens death .</l>
     <l n="25">He passed : but yet for many a lustrous year</l>
     <l n="26">His light of song bade England shine and hear .</l>
     <l n="27">As plague and fire and faith in falsehood spread ,</l>
     <l n="28">So from the man of men , divine and dead ,</l>
     <l n="29">Contagious godhead , seen , unknown , and heard ,</l>
     <l n="30">Fulfilled and quickened England ; thought and word ,</l>
     <l n="31">When men would fain set life to music , grew</l>
     <l n="32">More sweet than years which knew not Shakespeare knew .</l>
     <l n="33">The simplest soul that set itself to song</l>
     <l n="34">Sang , and may fear not time 's or change 's wrong .</l>
     <l n="35">The lightest eye that glanced on life could see</l>
     <l n="36">Through grief and joy the God that man might be .</l>
     <l n="37">All passion whence the living soul takes fire</l>
     <l n="38">Till death fulfil despair and quench desire ,</l>
     <l n="39">All love that lightens through the cloud of chance ,</l>
     <l n="40">All hate that lurks in hope and smites askance ,</l>
     <l n="41">All holiness of sorrow , all divine</l>
     <l n="42">Pity , whose tears are stars that save and shine ,</l>
     <l n="43">All sunbright strength of laughter like the sea 's</l>
     <l n="44">When spring and autumn loose their lustrous breeze ,</l>
     <l n="45">All sweet , all strange , all sad , all glorious things ,</l>
     <l n="46">Lived on his lips , and hailed him king of kings .</l>
     <l n="47">All thought , all strife , all anguish , all delight ,</l>
     <l n="48">Spake all he bade , and speak till day be night .</l>
     <l n="49">No soul that heard , no spirit that beheld ,</l>
     <l n="50">Knew not the God that lured them and compelled .</l>
     <l n="51">On Beaumont 's brow the sun arisen afar</l>
     <l n="52">Shed fire which lit through heaven the younger star</l>
     <l n="53">That sank before the sunset : one dark spring</l>
     <l n="54">Slew first the kinglike subject , then the king .</l>
     <l n="55">The glory left above their graves made strong</l>
     <l n="56">The heart of Fletcher , till the flower-sweet song</l>
     <l n="57">That Shakespeare culled from Chaucer 's field , and died ,</l>
     <l n="58">Found ending on his lips that smiled and sighed .</l>
     <l n="59">From Dekker 's eyes the light of tear-touched mirth</l>
     <l n="60">Shone as from Shakespeare 's , mingling heaven and earth .</l>
     <l n="61">Wild witchcraft 's lure and England 's love made one</l>
     <l n="62">With Shakespeare 's heart the heart of Middleton .</l>
     <l n="63">Harsh , homely , true , and tragic , Rowley told</l>
     <l n="64">His heart 's debt down in rough and radiant gold .</l>
     <l n="65">The skies that Tourneur 's lightning clove and rent</l>
     <l n="66">Flamed through the clouds where Shakespeare 's thunder went .</l>
     <l n="67">Wise Massinger bade kings be wise in vain</l>
     <l n="68">Ere war bade song , storm-stricken , cower and wane .</l>
     <l n="69">Kind Heywood , simple-souled and single-eyed ,</l>
     <l n="70">Found voice for England 's home-born praise and pride .</l>
     <l n="71">Strange grief , strange love , strange terror , bared the sword</l>
     <l n="72">That smote the soul by grace and will of Ford .</l>
     <l n="73">The stern grim strength of Chapman 's thought found speech</l>
     <l n="74">Loud as when storm at ebb-tide rends the beach :</l>
     <l n="75">And all the honey brewed from flowers in May</l>
     <l n="76">Made sweet the lips and bright the dreams of Day .</l>
     <l n="77">But even as Shakespeare caught from Marlowe 's word</l>
     <l n="78">Fire , so from his the thunder-bearing third ,</l>
     <l n="79">Webster , took light and might whence none but he</l>
     <l n="80">Hath since made song that sounded so the sea</l>
     <l n="81">Whose waves are lives of men — whose tidestream rolls</l>
     <l n="82">From year to darkening year the freight of souls .</l>
     <l n="83">Alone above it , sweet , supreme , sublime ,</l>
     <l n="84">Shakespeare attunes the jarring chords of time ;</l>
     <l n="85">Alone of all whose doom is death and birth ,</l>
     <l n="86">Shakespeare is lord of souls alive on earth .</l>
