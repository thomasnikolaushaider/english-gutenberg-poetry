     <l n="1">‘ Tis the hour when white-horsed Day</l>

     <l n="3">When the Gates of Dawn ( they say )</l>
     <l n="4">Phobus opes :</l>
     <l n="5">And I gather that the Queen</l>
     <l n="6">May be uniformly seen ,</l>
     <l n="7">Should the weather be serene ,</l>
     <l n="8">On the slopes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">When the ploughman , as he goes</l>
     <l n="10">Leathern-gaitered o'er the snows ,</l>
     <l n="11">From his hat and from his nose</l>
     <l n="12">Knocks the ice ;</l>
     <l n="13">And the panes are frosted o'er ,</l>
     <l n="14">And the lawn is crisp and hoar ,</l>
     <l n="15">As has been observed before</l>
     <l n="16">Once or twice .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">When arrayed in breastplate red</l>
     <l n="18">Sings the robin , for his bread ,</l>
     <l n="19">On the elmtree that hath shed</l>
     <l n="20">Every leaf ;</l>
     <l n="21">While , within , the frost benumbs</l>
     <l n="22">The still sleepy schoolboy 's thumbs ,</l>
     <l n="23">And in consequence his sums</l>
     <l n="24">Come to grief .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">But when breakfast-time hath come ,</l>

     <l n="28">Little dunce ;</l>
     <l n="29">But be brisk as bees that settle</l>

     <l n="2">On the lawn , when up the fells</l>
     <l n="3">Steals the Dark , and fairy fingers</l>

     <l n="5">When , his thighs with sweetness laden ,</l>
     <l n="6">From the meadow comes the bee ,</l>
     <l n="7">And the lover and the maiden</l>
     <l n="8">Stand beneath the trysting tree : -</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Lingers on , till stars unnumber 'd</l>

     <l n="11">And the bat that all day slumber 'd</l>
     <l n="12">Flits about the lonely barn ;</l>
     <l n="13">And the shapes that shrink from garish</l>
     <l n="14">Noon are peopling cairn and lea ;</l>
     <l n="15">And thy sire is almost bearish</l>
     <l n="16">If kept waiting for his tea : -</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">And the screech-owl scares the peasant</l>
     <l n="18">As he skirts some churchyard drear ;</l>
     <l n="19">And the goblins whisper pleasant</l>
     <l n="20">Tales in Miss Rossetti 's ear ;</l>
     <l n="21">Importuning her in strangest ,</l>
     <l n="22">Sweetest tones to buy their fruits : -</l>

    <head>SHELTER .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">By the wide lake 's margin I mark 'd her lie -</l>
     <l n="2">The wide , weird lake where the alders sigh -</l>
     <l n="3">A young fair thing , with a shy , soft eye ;</l>
     <l n="4">And I deem 'd that her thoughts had flown</l>
     <l n="5">To her home , and her brethren , and sisters dear ,</l>
     <l n="6">As she lay there watching the dark , deep mere ,</l>
     <l n="7">All motionless , all alone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">Then I heard a noise , as of men and boys ,</l>
     <l n="9">And a boisterous troop drew nigh .</l>
     <l n="10">Whither now will retreat those fairy feet ?</l>
     <l n="11">Where hide till the storm pass by ?</l>
     <l n="12">One glance — the wild glance of a hunted thing -</l>
     <l n="13">She cast behind her ; she gave one spring ;</l>
     <l n="14">And there follow 'd a splash and a broadening ring</l>
     <l n="15">On the lake where the alders sigh .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="16">She had gone from the ken of ungentle men !</l>
     <l n="17">Yet scarce did I mourn for that ;</l>
     <l n="18">For I knew she was safe in her own home then ,</l>
     <l n="19">And , the danger past , would appear again ,</l>
     <l n="20">For she was a water-rat .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>IN THE GLOAMING .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In the Gloaming to be roaming , where the crested waves are foaming ,</l>
     <l n="2">And the shy mermaidens combing locks that ripple to their feet ;</l>
     <l n="3">When the Gloaming is , I never made the ghost of an endeavour</l>
     <l n="4">To discover — but whatever were the hour , it would be sweet .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ To their feet , ” I say , for Leech 's sketch indisputably teaches</l>
     <l n="6">That the mermaids of our beaches do not end in ugly tails ,</l>
     <l n="7">Nor have homes among the corals ; but are shod with neat balmorals ,</l>
     <l n="8">An arrangement no one quarrels with , as many might with scales .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Sweet to roam beneath a shady cliff , of course with some young lady ,</l>
     <l n="10">Lalage , Neaera , Haidee , or Elaine , or Mary Ann :</l>
     <l n="11">Love , you dear delusive dream , you ! Very sweet your victims deem</l>
     <l n="12">you ,</l>
     <l n="13">When , heard only by the seamew , they talk all the stuff one can .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="14">Sweet to haste , a licensed lover , to Miss Pinkerton the glover ,</l>
     <l n="15">Having managed to discover what is dear Neaera 's “ size ":</l>
     <l n="16">P'raps to touch that wrist so slender , as your tiny gift you tender ,</l>
     <l n="17">And to read you 're no offender , in those laughing hazel eyes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="18">Then to hear her call you “ Harry , ” when she makes you fetch and</l>
     <l n="19">carry -</l>
     <l n="20">O young men about to marry , what a blessed thing it is !</l>
     <l n="21">To be photograph 'd — together — cased in pretty Russia leather -</l>
     <l n="22">Hear her gravely doubting whether they have spoilt your honest</l>
     <l n="23">phiz !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="24">Then to bring your plighted fair one first a ring — a rich and rare</l>
     <l n="25">one -</l>
     <l n="26">Next a bracelet , if she 'll wear one , and a heap of things beside ;</l>
     <l n="27">And serenely bending o'er her , to inquire if it would bore her</l>
     <l n="28">To say when her own adorer may aspire to call her bride !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="29">Then , the days of courtship over , with your WIFE to start for Dover</l>
     <l n="30">Or Dieppe — and live in clover evermore , whate'er befalls :</l>
     <l n="31">For I 've read in many a novel that , unless they 've souls that</l>
     <l n="32">grovel ,</l>
     <l n="33">Folks PREFER in fact a hovel to your dreary marble halls :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="34">To sit , happy married lovers ; Phillis trifling with a plover 's</l>
     <l n="35">Egg , while Corydon uncovers with a grace the Sally Lunn ,</l>
     <l n="36">Or dissects the lucky pheasant — that , I think , were passing</l>
     <l n="37">pleasant ;</l>
     <l n="38">As I sit alone at present , dreaming darkly of a Dun .</l>

    <head>THE PALACE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">They come , they come , with fife and drum ,</l>
     <l n="2">And gleaming pikes and glancing banners :</l>
     <l n="3">Though the eyes flash , the lips are dumb ;</l>
     <l n="4">To talk in rank would not be manners .</l>
     <l n="5">Onward they stride , as Britons can ;</l>
     <l n="6">The ladies following in the Van .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Who , who be these that tramp in threes</l>
     <l n="8">Through sumptuous Piccadilly , through</l>
     <l n="9">The roaring Strand , and stand at ease</l>
     <l n="10">At last ‘ neath shadowy Waterloo ?</l>
     <l n="11">Some gallant Guild , I ween , are they ;</l>
     <l n="12">Taking their annual holiday .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">To catch the destin 'd train — to pay</l>

     <l n="16">With them the work of half-a-minute .</l>
     <l n="17">Then off they 're whirl 'd , with songs and shouting ,</l>
     <l n="18">To cedared Sydenham for their outing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">I mark 'd them light , with faces bright</l>
     <l n="20">As pansies or a new coin 'd florin ,</l>
     <l n="21">And up the sunless stair take flight ,</l>
     <l n="22">Close-pack 'd as rabbits in a warren .</l>

     <l n="26">In every kerchief lurk 'd a lunch ;</l>
     <l n="27">When they unfurl 'd them , it was grand</l>
     <l n="28">To watch bronzed men and maidens crunch</l>
     <l n="29">The sounding celery-stick , or ram</l>
     <l n="30">The knife into the blushing ham .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">Dash 'd the bold fork through pies of pork ;</l>

     <l n="36">They chose the red root of the beet .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">Then many a song , some rather long ,</l>
     <l n="38">Came quivering up from girlish throats ;</l>

     <l n="40">And gave “ The Wolf ” without his notes .</l>
     <l n="41">While they who knew not song or ballad</l>

     <l n="1">He stood , a worn-out City clerk -</l>

     <l n="4">Alone beside Caermarthen Bay .</l>

     <l n="4">Since they roused thee at dawn from thy straw-piled lair ,</l>
     <l n="5">To tread with those echoless unshod feet</l>
     <l n="6">Yon weltering flats in the noontide heat ,</l>
     <l n="7">Where no palmtree proffers a kindly shade</l>
     <l n="8">And the eye never rests on a cool grass blade ;</l>

     <l n="14">And thy nostril upturn 'd to the od'rous air ,</l>

     <l n="16">At leisure the lines of that eager face ;</l>
     <l n="17">The collarless neck and the coal-black paws</l>
     <l n="18">And the bit grasp 'd tight in the massive jaws ;</l>
