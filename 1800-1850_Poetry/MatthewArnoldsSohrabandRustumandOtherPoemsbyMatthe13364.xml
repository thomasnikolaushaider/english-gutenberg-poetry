    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD</p>
    <p n="2">Matthew Arnold , poet and critic , was born in the village of Laleham , Middlesex County , England , December 24 , 1822 . He was the son of Dr. Thomas Arnold , best remembered as the great Head Master at Rugby and in later years distinguished also as a historian of Rome , and of Mary Penrose Arnold , a woman of remarkable character and intellect .</p>
    <p n="3">Devoid of stirring incident , and , on the whole , free from the eccentricities so common to men of genius , the story of Arnold 's life is soon told . As a boy he lived the life of the normal English lad , with its healthy routine of task and play . He was at school at both Laleham and Winchester , then at Rugby , where he attracted attention as a student and won a prize for poetry . In 1840 he was elected to an open scholarship at Balliol College , Oxford , and the next year matriculated for his university work . Arnold 's career at Oxford was a memorable one . While here he was associated with such men as John Duke Coleridge , John Shairp , Dean Fraser , Dean Church , John Henry Newman , Thomas Hughes , the Froudes , and , closest of all , with Arthur Hugh Clough , whose early death he lamented in his exquisite elegiac poem — Thyrsis . Among this brilliant company Arnold moved with ease , the recognized favorite . Having taken the Newdigate prize for English verse , and also having won a scholarship , he was graduated with honors in 1844 , and in March of the following year had the additional distinction of being elected a Fellow of Oriel , the crowning glory of an Oxford graduate . He afterward taught classics for a short time at Rugby , then in 1847 accepted the post of private secretary to the Marquis of Lansdowne , Lord President of the Council , which position he occupied until 1851 , when he was appointed Lay Inspector of Schools by the Committee on Education . The same year he married Frances Lucy Wightman , daughter of Sir William Wightman , judge of the Court of the Queen 's Bench .</p>
    <p n="4">Arnold 's record as an educator is unparalleled in the history of England 's public schools . For more than thirty-five years he served as inspector and commissioner , which offices he filled with efficiency . As inspector he was earnest , conscientious , versatile ; beloved alike by teachers and pupils . The Dean of Salisbury likened his appearance to inspect the school at Kiddermaster , to the admission of a ray of light when a shutter is suddenly opened in a darkened room . All-in-all , he valued happy-appearing children , and kindly sympathetic teachers , more than excellence in grade reports . In connection with the duties of his office as commissioner , he travelled frequently on the Continent to inquire into foreign methods of primary and secondary education . Here he found much that was worth while , and often carried back to London larger suggestions and ideas than the national mind was ready to accept . Under his supervision , however , the school system of England was extensively revised and improved . He resigned his position under the Committee of Council on Education , in 1886 , two years before his death .</p>
    <p n="5">In the meantime Arnold 's pen had not been idle . His first volume of verse , The Strayed Reveller and Other Poems , appeared ( 1848 ) , and although quietly received , slowly won its way into public favor . The next year the narrative poem , The Sick King in Bokhara , came out , and was followed in turn by a third volume in 1853 , under the title of Empedocles on Etna and Other Poems . By this time Arnold 's reputation as a poet was established , and in 1857 he was elected Professor of Poetry at Oxford , where he began his career as a lecturer , in which capacity he twice visited America . Merope , a Tragedy ( 1856 ) and a volume under the title of New Poems ( 1869 ) finish the list of his poetical works , with the exception of occasional verses .</p>
    <p n="6">Arnold 's prose works , aside from his letters , consist wholly of critical essays , in which he has dealt fearlessly with the greater issues of his day . As will be seen by their titles ( see page xxxviii of this volume ) , the subject-matter of these essays is of very great scope , embracing in theme literature , politics , social conduct , and popular religion . By them Arnold has exerted a remarkable influence on public thought and stamped himself as one of the ablest critics and reformers of the last century . Arnold 's life was thus one of many widely diverse activities and was at all times deeply concerned with practical as well as with literary affairs ; and on no side was it deficient in human sympathies and relations . He won respect and reputation while he lived , and his works continue to attract men 's minds , although with much unevenness . It has been said of him that , of all the modern poets , except Goethe , he was the best critic , and of all the modern critics , with the same exception , he was the best poet . He died at Liverpool , where he had gone to meet his daughter returning from America , April 15 , 1888 . By his death the world lost an acute and cultured critic , a refined writer , an earnest educational reformer , and a noble man . He was buried in his native town , Laleham .</p>
    <p n="7">Agreeably to his own request , Arnold has never been made the subject for a biography . By means of his letters , his official reports , and statements of his friends , however , one is able to trace the successive stages of his career , as he steadily grew in honor and public usefulness . Though somewhat inadequate , the picture thus presented is singularly pleasing and attractive . The subjoined appreciations have been selected with a view of giving the student a glimpse of Arnold as he appeared to unprejudiced minds .</p>
    <p n="8">One who knew him at Oxford wrote of him as follows : “ His perfect self-possession , the sallies of his ready wit , the humorous turn which he could give to any subject that he handled , his gaiety , audacity , and unfailing command of words , made him one of the most popular and successful undergraduates that Oxford has ever known . ”</p>
    <p n="9">“ He was beautiful as a young man , strong and manly , yet full of dreams and schemes . His Olympian manners began even at Oxford : there was no harm in them : they were natural , not put on . The very sound of his voice and wave of his arm were Jove-like . ” — PROFESSOR MAX MÜLLER .</p>
    <p n="10">“ He was most distinctly on the side of human enjoyment . He conspired and contrived to make things pleasant . Pedantry he abhorred . He was a man of this life and this world . A severe critic of this world he indeed was ; but , finding himself in it , and not precisely knowing what is beyond it , like a brave and true-hearted man , he set himself to make the best of it . Its sights and sounds were dear to him . The ‘ uncrumpling fern , the eternal moonlit snow , ’ the red grouse springing at our sound , the tinkling bells of the ‘ high-pasturing kine , ’ the vagaries of men , of women , and dogs , their odd ways and tricks , whether of mind or manner , all delighted , amused , tickled him .</p>

   <p>“ In a sense of the word which is noble and blessed , he was of the earth earthy .... His mind was based on the plainest possible things . What he hated most was the fantastic — the far-fetched , all-elaborated fancies and strained interpretations . He stuck to the beaten track of human experience , and the broader the better . He was a plain-sailing man . This is his true note . ” — MR. AUGUSTINE BIRRELL .</p>
   <p>“ He was incapable of sacrificing the smallest interest of anybody to his own ; he had not a spark of envy or jealousy ; he stood well aloof from all the bustlings and jostlings by which selfish men push on ; he bore life 's disappointments — and he was disappointed in some reasonable hopes — with good nature and fortitude ; he cast no burden upon others , and never shrank from bearing his own share of the daily load to the last ounce of it ; he took the deepest , sincerest , and most active interest in the well-being of his country and his countrymen . ” — MR. JOHN MORLEY .</p>
   <p>In his essay on Arnold , George E. Woodberry speaks of the poet 's personality as revealed by his letters in the following beautiful manner : “ Few who did not know Arnold could have been prepared for the revelation of a nature so true , so amiable , so dutiful . In every relation of private life he is shown to have been a man of exceptional constancy and plainness .... Every one must take delight in the mental association with Arnold in the scenes of his existence ... and in his family affections . A nature warm to its own , kindly to all , cheerful , fond of sport and fun , and always fed from pure fountains , and with it a character so founded upon the rock , so humbly serviceable , so continuing in power and grace , must wake in all the responses of happy appreciation and leave the charm of memory .</p>
   <p>“ He did his duty as naturally as if it required neither resolve nor effort , nor thought of any kind for the morrow , and he never failed , seemingly , in act or word of sympathy , in little or great things ; and when to this one adds the clear ether of the intellectual life where he habitually moved in his own life apart , and the humanity of his home , the gift that these letters bring may be appreciated . That gift is the man himself , but set in the atmosphere of home , with sonship and fatherhood , sisters and brothers , with the bereavements of years fully accomplished , and those of babyhood and boyhood — a sweet and wholesome English home , with all the cloud and sunshine of the English world drifting over its roof-trees , and the soil of England beneath its stones , and English duties for the breath of its being . To add such a home to the household rights of English Literature is perhaps something from which Arnold would have shrunk , but it endears his memory . ”</p>

  <p>ARNOLD THE POET</p>
   <p>Matthew Arnold was essentially a man of the intellect . No other author of modern times , perhaps no other English author of any time , appeals so directly as he to the educated classes . Even a cursory reading of his pages , prose or verse , reveals the scholar and the critic . He is always thinking , always brilliant , never lacks for a word or phrase ; and on the whole , his judgments are good . Between his prose and verse , however , there is a marked difference , both in tone and spiritual quality . True , each possesses the note of a lofty , though stoical courage ; reveals the same grace of finish and exactness of phrase and manner ; and is , in equal degree , the output of a singularly sane and noble nature ; but here the comparison ends ; for , while his prose is often stormy and contentious , his poetry has always about it an atmosphere of entire repose . The cause of this difference is not far to seek . His poetry , written in early manhood , reflects his inner self , the more lovable side of his nature ; while his prose presents the critic and the reformer , pointing out the good and bad , and permitting at times a spirit of bitterness to creep in , as he endeavors to arouse men out of their easy contentment with themselves and their surroundings .</p>
   <p>With the exception of occasional verses , Arnold 's poetical career began and ended inside of twenty years . The reason for this can only be conjectured , and need not be dwelt upon here . But although his poetic life was brief , it was of a very high order , his poems ranking well up among the literary productions of the last century . As a popular poet , however , he will probably never class with Tennyson or Longfellow . His poems are too coldly classical and too unattractive in subject to appeal to the casual reader , who is , generally speaking , inclined toward poetry of the emotions rather than of the intellect — Arnold 's usual kind . That he recognized this himself , witness the following quiet statements made in letters to his friends : “ My poems are making their way , I think , though slowly , and are perhaps never to make way very far . There must always be some people , however , to whom the literalness and sincerity of them has a charm .... They represent , on the whole , the main movement of mind of the last quarter of a century , and thus they will probably have their day , as people become conscious to themselves of what that movement of mind is , and interested in the literary productions which reflect it . ” Time has verified the accuracy of this judgment . In short , Arnold has made a profound rather than a wide impression . To a few , however , of each generation , he will continue to be a “ voice oracular , ” — a poet with a purpose and a message .</p>
   <p>= Arnold 's Poetic Culture =.— Obviously , the sources of Arnold 's culture were classical . As one critic has tersely said , “ He turned over his Greek models by day and by night . ” Here he found his ideal standards , and here he brought for comparison all questions that engrossed his thoughts . Homer ( he replied to an inquirer ) and Epictetus ( of mood congenial with his own ) were props of his mind , as were Sophocles , “ who saw life steadily and saw it whole , ” and Marcus Aurelius , whom he called the purest of men . These like natures afforded him repose and consolation . Greek epic and dramatic poetry and Greek philosophy appealed profoundly to him . Of the Greek poets he wrote : “ No other poets have lived so much by the imaginative reason ; no other poets have made their works so well balanced ; no other poets have so well satisfied the thinking power ; have so well satisfied the religious sense . ” More than any other English poet he prized the qualities of measure , proportion , and restraint ; and to him lucidity , austerity , and high seriousness , conspicuous elements of classic verse , were the substance of true poetry . In explaining his own position as to his art , he says : “ In the sincere endeavor to learn and practise , amid the bewildering confusion of our times , what is sound and true in poetic art , I seem , to myself to find the only sure guidance , the only solid footing , among the ancients . They , at any rate , knew what they wanted in Art , and we do not . It is this uncertainty which is disheartening , and not hostile criticism . ” And again : “ The radical difference between the poetic theory of the Greeks and our own is this : that with them , the poetical character of the action in itself , and the conduct of it , was the first consideration ; with us , attention is fixed mainly on the value of separate thoughts and images which occur in the treatment of an action . They regard the whole ; we regard the parts . We have poems which seem to exist merely for the sake of single lines and passages , and not for the sake of producing any total impression . We have critics who seem to direct their attention merely to detached expressions , to the language about the action , not the action itself . I verily believe that the majority of them do not believe that there is such a thing as a total impression to be derived from a poem at all , or to be demanded from a poet . They will permit the poet to select any action he pleases , and to suffer that action to go as it will , provided he gratifies them with occasional bursts of fine writing , and with a show of isolated thoughts and images ; that is , they permit him to leave their poetic sense ungratified , provided that he gratifies their rhetorical sense and their curiosity . ”</p>
   <p>Arnold has illustrated , with remarkable success , his ideas of that unity which gratifies the poetical sense , and has approached very close to his Greek models in numerous instances ; most notably so in his great epic or narrative poem , Sohrab and Rustum , which is dealt with elsewhere in this introduction . Perhaps we could not do better than to quote for our consideration at this time , a fine synthesis of Mr. Arthur Galton . He says : “ In Matthew Arnold 's style and in his manner , he seems to me to recall the great masters , and this in a striking and in an abiding way .... To recall them at all is a rare gift , but to recall them naturally , and with no strained sense nor jarring note of imitation , is a gift so exceedingly rare that it is almost enough in itself to place a writer among the great masters ; to proclaim that he is one of them . To recall them at all is a rare gift , though not a unique gift ; a few other modern poets recall them too ; but with these , with every one of them , it is the exception when they resemble the great masters . They have their own styles , which abide with them ; it is only now and then , by a flash of genius , that they break through their own styles , and attain the one immortal style . Just the contrary of this is true of Matthew Arnold . It is his own , his usual , and his most natural style which recalls the great masters ; and only when he does not write like himself , does he cease to resemble them .... No man who attains to this great style can fail to have a distinguished function ; and Matthew Arnold , like Milton , will be ‘ a leaven and a power , ’ because he , too , has made the great style current in English . With his desire for culture and for perfection , there is no destiny he would prefer to this , for which his nature , his training , and his sympathies , all prepared him . To convey the message of those ancients whom he loved so well , in that English tongue which he was taught by them to use so perfectly ;— to serve as an eternal protest against charlatanism and vulgarity ;— is exactly the mission he would have chosen for himself .... The few writers of our language , therefore , who give us ‘ an ideal of excellence , the most high and the most rare , ’ have an important function ; we should study their works continually , and it should be a matter of passionate concern with us , that the ‘ ideals , ’ that is , the definite and perfect models , should abide with us forever . ” The Greeks recognized three kinds of poetry ,— Lyric , Dramatic , and Epic . Arnold tried all three . First , then , as a lyricist .</p>
   <p>= Arnold as a Lyricist =.— Lyric poetry is the artistic expression of the poet 's individual sentiments and emotions , hence it is subjective . The action is usually vapid , the verse musical , the time quick . Unlike the Epic and Drama , it has no preferred verse or meter , but leaves the poet free to choose or invent appropriate forms . In this species of verse Arnold was not wholly at ease . As has been said , one searches in vain through the whole course of his poetry for a blithe , musical , gay or serious , offhand poem , the true lyric kind . The reason for this is soon discovered . Obviously , it lies in the fundamental qualities of the poet 's mind and temperament . Though by no means lacking in emotional sensibility , Arnold was too intellectually self-conscious to be carried away by the impulsiveness common to the lyrical moods . With him the intellect was always master ; the emotions , subordinate . With the lyricist , the order is , in the main , at least , reversed . The poet throws off intellectual restraint , and “ lets his illumined being o'errun ” with music and song . This Arnold could not or would not do . Then , too , Arnold 's lyrics are often at fault metrically . This , combined with frequent questionable rhymes , argues a not too discriminating poetical ear . He also lacked genius in inventing verse forms , and hence found himself under the necessity of employing or adapting those already in use . In this respect he was notably inferior to Tennyson , many of whose measures are wholly his own . Again , considerable portions of his lyric verse consist merely of prose , cut into lines of different length , in imitation of the unrhymed measures of the Greek poet , Pindar . The Bishop of Derry , commenting on these rhythmic novelties , likens them to the sound of a stick drawn by a city gamin sharply across the area railings ,— a not inapt comparison . That they were not always successful , witness the following stanza from Merope :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Thou confessest the prize</l>
     <l n="2">In the rushing , blundering , mad ,</l>
     <l n="3">Cloud-enveloped , obscure ,</l>
     <l n="4">Unapplauded , unsung</l>
     <l n="5">Race of Calamity , mine ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Surely this is but the baldest prose . At intervals , however , Arnold was nobly lyrical , and strangely , too , at times , in those same uneven measures in which are found his most signal failures — the unrhymed Pindaric . Philomela written in this style is one of the most exquisite bits of verse in the language . As one critic has put it , “ It ought to be written in silver and bound in gold . ” In urbanity of phrase and in depth of genuine pathos it is unsurpassed and shows Arnold at his best . Rugby Chapel , The Youth of Nature , The Youth of Man , and A Dream are good examples of his longer efforts in this verse form . In the more common lyric measures , Arnold was , at times , equally successful . Saintsbury , commenting on Requiescat , says that the poet has “ here achieved the triple union of simplicity , pathos , and ( in the best sense ) elegance ” ; and adds that there is not a false note in the poem . He also speaks enthusiastically of the “ honey-dropping trochees ” of the New Sirens , and of the “ chiselled and classic perfection ” of the lines of Resignation . Herbert W. Paul , writing of Mycerinus , declares that no such verse has been written in England since Wordsworth 's Laodamia ; and continues , “ The poem abounds in single lines of haunting charm . ” Among his more successful longer lyrics are The Sick King in Bokhara , Switzerland , Faded Leaves , and Tristram and Iseult , and Epilogue to Lessing 's Laocoön , included in this volume .</p>
   <p>= Arnold as a Dramatist =.— The drama is imitated human action , and is intended to exhibit a picture of human life by means of dialogue , acting , and stage accessories . In nature , it partakes of both lyric and epic , thus uniting sentiment and action with narration . Characters live and act before us , and speak in our presence , the interest being kept up by constantly shifting situations tending toward some striking result . As a dramatist , Arnold achieved no great success . Again the fundamental qualities of his mind stood in the way . An author so subjective , so absorbed in self-scrutiny and introspection as he , is seldom able to project himself into the minds of others to any considerable extent . His dramas are brilliant with beautiful phrases , his pictures of landscapes and of nature in her various aspects approach perfection ; but in the main , he fails to handle his plots in a dramatic manner and , as a result , does not secure the totality of impression so vital to the drama . Frequently , too , his characters are tedious , and in their dialogue manage to be provokingly unnatural or insipid . They also lack in individuality and independence in speech and action . Many of his situations , likewise , are at fault . For instance , one can scarcely conceive of such characters as Ulysses and Circe playing the subordinate roles assigned to them in The Strayed Reveller . A true dramatist would hardly have committed so flagrant a blunder . Merope is written in imitation of the Greek tragedians . It has dignity of subject , nobility of sentiment , and a classic brevity of style ; but it is frigid and artificial , and fails in the most essential function of drama — to stir the reader 's emotions . Empedocles on Etna , a half-autobiographical drama , is in some respects a striking poem . It is replete with brilliant passages , and contains some of Arnold 's best lyric verses and most beautiful nature pictures ; but the dialogue is colorless , the rhymes poor , the plot , such as it contains , but indifferently handled , and even Empedocles , the principal character , is frequently tedious and unnatural . Arnold 's dramas show that his forte was not in character-drawing nor in dialogue .</p>
   <p>= Arnold as a Writer of Epic and Elegy =.— Epic poetry narrates in grand style the achievements of heroes — the poet telling the story as if present . It is simple in construction and uniform in meter , yet it admits of the dialogue and the episode , and though not enforcing a moral it may hold one in solution . Elegiac poetry is plaintive in tone and expresses sorrow or lamentation . Both epic and elegy are inevitably serious in mood , and slow and stately in action . In these two forms of verse Arnold was at his best . Stockton pronounced Sohrab and Rustum the noblest poem in the English language . Another critic has said that “ it is the nearest analogue in English to the rapidity of action , plainness of thought , plainness of diction , and nobleness of Homer . ” Combining , as it does , classic purity of style with romantic ardor of feeling , it stands a direct exemplification of Arnold 's poetic theories , as set forth in the preface of his volume of 1853 . Especially is it successful in emphasizing his idea of unity of impression ; “ while the truth of its oriental color , the deep pathos of the situation , the fire and intensity of the action , the strong conception of character , and the full , solemn music of the verse , make it unquestionably the masterpiece of Arnold 's longer poems , among which it is the largest in bulk and also the most ambitious in scheme . ” Balder Dead , a characteristic Arnoldian production , founded upon the Norse legend of Balder , Lok , and Hader , though not so great as Sohrab and Rustum , has much poetic worth and ranks high among its kind ; and Tristram and Iseult , with its infinite tragedy , and The Sick King in Bokhara , gorgeous in oriental color , are rare examples of the lyrical epic . The Forsaken Merman and Saint Brandan , which are dealt with elsewhere in this volume , are good examples of his shorter narrative poems . In Thyrsis , the beautiful threnody in which he celebrated his dead friend , Clough , Arnold gave to the world one of its greatest elegies . One finds in this poem and its companion piece , The Scholar-Gipsy , the same unity of classic form with romantic feeling present in Sohrab and Rustum . Both are crystal-clear without coldness , and restrained without loss of a full volume of power . Mr. Saintsbury , writing of The Scholar-Gipsy , says : “ It has everything — a sufficient scheme , a definite meaning and purpose , a sustained and adequate command of poetical presentation , and passages and phrases of the most exquisite beauty ; ” and no less praise is due Thyrsis . Other of his elegiac poems are Heine 's Grave , Stanzas from the Grande Chartreuse , Stanzas in Memory of the Author of “ Obermann , ” Obermann Once More , Rugby Chapel , and Memorial Verses , the two last named being included in this volume . In such measures as are used in these poems , in the long , stately , swelling measures , whose graver movements accord with a serious and elevated purpose , Arnold was most at ease .</p>
   <p>= Greek Spirit in Arnold =.— But it is not alone in the fact that he selects classic subjects , and writes after the manner of the great masters , that Arnold 's affinity with the Greeks is manifested . His poems in spirit , as in form , reflect the moods common to the ancient Hellenes , “ One feels the ( Greek ) quality , ” writes George E. Woodberry , “ not as a source , but as a presence . In Tennyson , Keats , and Shelley there was Greek influence , but in them the result was modern . In Arnold the antiquity remains — remains in mood , just as in Landor it remains in form . The Greek twilight broods over all his poetry . It is pagan in philosophic spirit , not Attic , but of later and stoical time ; with the patience , endurance , suffering , not in the Christian types , but as they now seem to a post-Christian imagination , looking back to the past . ” Even when his poems treat of modern or romantic subjects , one is impressed with the feeling that he presents them with the same quality of imagination as would the Greek masters themselves : and in the same form .</p>
   <p>= Arnold 's Attitude toward Nature =.— In his attitude toward Nature Arnold is often compared to Wordsworth . A close study , however , reveals a wide difference , both in the way Nature appealed to them and in their mood in her presence . To Arnold she offered a temporary refuge from the doubts and distractions of our modern life ,— a soothing , consoling , uplifting power ; to Wordsworth she was an inspiration ,— a presence that disturbed him “ with the joy of elevated thoughts . ” Conscious of the help he found in her association , Arnold urged all men to follow Nature 's example ; to possess their souls in quietude , despite the storm and turmoil without . Pancoast says : “ He delights in leading us to contemplate the infinite calm of Nature , beside which man 's transitory woes are reduced to a mere fretful insignificance . All the beautiful poem of Tristram and Iseult is built upon the skilful alternation of two themes . We pass from the feverish , wasting , and ephemeral struggle of human passions and desire , into an atmosphere that shames its heat and fume by an immemorial coolness and repose ; ” and the same comparison constitutes the theme for a considerable portion of his poetical work . In his method of approaching Nature , Arnold also differed widely from Wordsworth , in that he saw with the outward eye , that is objectively ; while Wordsworth saw rather with the inward eye , or subjectively . In this Arnold is essentially Greek and more Tennysonian than Wordsworthian . Many of his poems , in full or in part , are mere nature pictures , and are artistic in the extreme . The pictures of the Oxus stream at the close of Sohrab and Rustum ; the English garden in Thyrsis ; and the hunter on the arras , in Tristram and Iseult , are all notable examples . This pictorial method Wordsworth seldom used . In spirit , too , the poets differed widely . To Wordsworth , Nature was , first of all , the abiding place of God ; but Arnold “ finds in the wood and field no streaming forth of beauty and wisdom from the fountainhead of beauty , ” no habitancy of Nature 's God .</p>
   <p>= Arnold 's Attitude toward Life =.— Arnold 's attitude toward life has been dwelt upon in the appreciations under the biographical sketch in this volume and need only briefly be summed up here . To him , human life in its higher developments presented itself as a stern and strenuous affair ; but he never faltered nor sought to escape from his share of the burden . “ On the contrary , the prevailing note of his poetry is self-reliance ; help must come from the soul itself , for</p>
   <p>“ The fountains of life are all within . ”</p>
   <p>He preaches fortitude and courage in the face of the mysterious and the inevitable — a courage , indeed , forlorn and pathetic in the eyes of many — and he constantly takes refuge from the choking cares of life , in a kind of stoical resignation . ” As a reformer , his function was especially to stir people up , to make them dissatisfied with themselves and their institutions , and to force them to think , to become individual . Everywhere in his works one is confronted by his unvarying insistence upon the supremacy of conduct and duty . The modern tendency to drift away from the old , established religious faith was a matter of serious thought to him and led him to give to the world a rational creed that would satisfy the sceptics and attract the indifferent . We cannot do better than quote for our closing thought the following pregnant lines from the author 's sonnet entitled The Better Part :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Hath man no second life ? Pitch this one high !</l>
     <l n="2">Sits there no judge in Heaven , our sin to see ?</l>
     <l n="3">More strictly , then , the inward judge obey !</l>
     <l n="4">Was Christ a man like us ? Ah ! let us try</l>
     <l n="5">If we then , too , can be such men as he ! ”</l>

    <p>ARNOLD THE CRITIC</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">The following extracts on Arnold as a critic are quoted from</l>
     <l n="7">well-known authorities .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Arnold 's prose has little trace of the wistful melancholy of his verse . It is almost always urbane , vivacious , light-hearted . The classical bent of his mind shows itself here , unmixed with the inheritance of romantic feeling which colors his poetry . Not only is his prose classical in quality , by virtue of its restraint , of its definite aim , and of the dry white light of intellect which suffuses it ; but the doctrine which he spent his life in preaching is based upon a classical ideal , the ideal of symmetry , wholeness , or , as he daringly called it , perfection .... Wherever , in religion , politics , education , or literature , he saw his countrymen under the domination of narrow ideals , he came speaking the mystic word of deliverance , ‘ Culture . ’ Culture , acquaintance with the best which has been thought and done in the world , is his panacea for all ills .... In almost all of his prose writing he attacks some form of ‘ Philistinism , ’ by which word he characterized the narrow-mindedness and self-satisfaction of the British middle class .</p>
   <p>“ Arnold 's tone is admirably fitted to the peculiar task he had to perform .... In Culture and Anarchy and many successive works , he made his plea for the gospel of ideas with urbanity and playful grace , as befitted the Hellenic spirit , bringing ‘ sweetness and light ’ into the dark places of British prejudice . Sometimes , as in Literature and Dogma , where he pleads for a more liberal and literary reading of the Bible , his manner is quiet , suave , and gently persuasive . At other times , as in Friendship 's Garland , he shoots the arrows of his sarcasm into the ranks of the Philistines with a delicate raillery and scorn , all the more exasperating to his foes , because it is veiled by a mock humility , and is scrupulously polite .</p>
   <p>“ Of Arnold 's literary criticism , the most notable single piece is the famous essay On Translating Homer , which deserves careful study for the enlightenment it offers concerning many of the fundamental questions of style . The essays on Wordsworth and on Byron from Essays in Criticism , and that on Emerson , from Discourses in America , furnish good examples of Arnold 's charm of manner and weight of matter in this province .</p>
   <p>“ The total impression which Arnold makes in his prose may be described as that of a spiritual man-of-the-world . In comparison with Carlyle , Buskin , and Newman , he is worldly . For the romantic passion and mystic vision of these men he substitutes an ideal of balanced cultivation , the ideal of the trained , sympathetic , cosmopolitan gentleman . He marks a return to the conventions of life after the storm and stress of the romantic age . Yet in his own way he also was a prophet and a preacher , striving whole-heartedly to release his countrymen from bondage to mean things , and pointing their gaze to that symmetry and balance of character which has seemed to many noble minds the true goal of human endeavor . ” — MOODY AND LOVETT , A History of English Literature .</p>
   <p>“ As a literary critic , his taste , his temper , his judgment were pretty nearly infallible . He combined a loyal and reasonable submission to literary authority , with a free and even daring use of private judgment . His admiration for the acknowledged masters of human utterance — Homer , Sophocles , Shakespeare , Milton , Goethe — was genuine and enthusiastic , and incomparably better informed than that of some more conventional critics . Yet this cordial submission to recognized authority , this honest loyalty to established reputation , did not blind him to defects ; did not seduce him into indiscriminating praise ; did not deter him from exposing the tendency to verbiage in Burke and Jeremy Taylor , the excess blankness of much of Wordsworth 's blank verse , the undercurrent of mediocrity in Macaulay , the absurdities of Mr. Ruskin 's etymology . And as in great matters , so in small . Whatever literary production was brought under Matthew Arnold 's notice , his judgment was clear , sympathetic , and independent . He had the readiest appreciation of true excellence , a quick intolerance of turgidity and inflation — of what he called endeavors to render platitude endurable by making it pompous , and lively horror of affectation and unreality . ” — Mr. GEORGE RUSSELL .</p>
   <p>“ In his work as literary critic Arnold has occupied a high place among the foremost prose writers of the time . His style is in marked contrast to the dithyrambic eloquence of Carlyle , or to Ruskin 's pure and radiant coloring . It is a quiet style , restrained , clear , discriminating , incisive , with little glow of ardor or passion . Notwithstanding its scrupulous assumption of urbanity , it is often a merciless style , indescribably irritating to an opponent by its undercurrent of sarcastic humor , and its calm air of assured superiority . By his insistence on a high standard of technical excellence , and by his admirable presentation of certain principles of literary judgment , Arnold performed a great work for literature . On the other hand , we miss here , as in his poetry , the human element , the comprehensive sympathy that we recognize in the criticism of Carlyle . Yet Carlyle could not have written the essay On Translating Homer , with all its scholarly discrimination in style and technique , any more than Arnold could have produced Carlyle 's large-hearted essay on Burns . Arnold 's varied energy and highly trained intelligence have been felt in many different fields . He has won a peculiar and honorable place in the poetry of the century ; he has excelled as literary critic , he has labored in the cause of education , and finally , in his Culture and Anarchy , he has set forth his scheme of social reform , and in certain later books has made His contribution to contemporary thought . ” — PANCOAST , Introduction to English Literature .</p>

     <l n="19">Crossing the stream in summer , scrapes the land .</l>
     <l n="20">The men of former times had crown 'd the top 20</l>
     <l n="21">With a clay fort ; but that was fall'n , and now</l>
     <l n="22">The Tartars built there Peran-Wisa 's tent ,</l>
     <l n="23">A dome of laths , and o'er it felts were spread .</l>

     <l n="25">Upon the thick piled carpets in the tent , 25</l>
     <l n="26">And found the old man sleeping on his bed</l>
     <l n="27">Of rugs and felts , and near him lay his arms .</l>
     <l n="28">And Peran-Wisa heard him , though the step</l>
     <l n="29">Was dull 'd ; for he slept light , an old man 's sleep ;</l>
     <l n="30">And he rose quickly on one arm , and said :— 30</l>

     <l n="31">“ Who art thou ? for it is not yet clear dawn .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="33">But Sohrab came to the bedside , and said :—</l>

     <l n="35">The sun is not yet risen , and the foe 35</l>

     <l n="37">Tossing and wakeful , and I come to thee .</l>
     <l n="38">For so did King Afrasiab ° bid me seek ° 38</l>

     <l n="42">Thou know'st if , since from Ader-baijan ° first ° 42</l>
     <l n="43">I came among the Tartars and bore arms ,</l>
     <l n="44">I have still served Afrasiab well , and shown ,</l>

     <l n="46">This too thou know'st , that while I still bear on</l>
     <l n="47">The conquering Tartar ensigns through the world ,</l>
     <l n="48">And beat the Persians back on every field ,</l>
     <l n="49">I seek one man , one man , and one alone —</l>
     <l n="50">Rustum , my father ; who I hoped should greet , 50</l>
     <l n="51">Should one day greet , upon some well-fought field ,</l>
     <l n="52">His not unworthy , not inglorious son .</l>
     <l n="53">So I long hoped , but him I never find .</l>
     <l n="54">Come then , hear now , and grant me what I ask .</l>
     <l n="55">Let the two armies rest to-day ; but I 55</l>

     <l n="58">Rustum will surely hear it ; if I fall —</l>
     <l n="59">Old man , the dead need no one , claim no kin .</l>
     <l n="60">Dim is the rumour of a common fight ,° ° 60</l>
     <l n="61">Where host meets host , and many names are sunk °; ° 61</l>
     <l n="62">But of a single combat fame speaks clear . ”</l>

     <l n="63">He spoke ; and Peran-Wisa took the hand</l>

     <l n="65">“ O Sohrab , an unquiet heart is thine ! 65</l>

     <l n="71">That were far best , my son , to stay with us</l>

     <l n="73">And when ‘ tis truce , then in Afrasiab 's towns .</l>
     <l n="74">But , if this one desire indeed rules all ,</l>
     <l n="75">To seek out Rustum — seek him not through fight ! 75</l>
     <l n="76">Seek him in peace , and carry to his arms ,</l>
     <l n="77">O Sohrab , carry an unwounded son !</l>
     <l n="78">But far hence seek him , for he is not here .</l>
     <l n="79">For now it is not as when I was young ,</l>
     <l n="80">When Rustum was in front of every fray ; 80</l>
     <l n="81">But now he keeps apart , and sits at home ,</l>
     <l n="82">In Seistan ,° with Zal , his father old . ° 82</l>
     <l n="83">Whether that his own mighty strength at last</l>

     <l n="126">And then a swarm of wandering horse , who came</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="302">As some rich woman , on a winter 's morn ,</l>

     <l n="311">All the most valiant chiefs ; long he perused ° ° 311</l>
     <l n="312">His spirited air , and wonder 'd who he was .</l>

     <l n="398">He spoke , and Rustum answer 'd not , but hurl 'd</l>

     <l n="416">The club which Rustum lifted now , and struck</l>

     <l n="418">Lithe as the glancing ° snake , and the club came ° 418</l>
     <l n="419">Thundering to earth , and leapt from Rustum 's hand .</l>
     <l n="420">And Rustum follow 'd his own blow , and fell 420</l>

     <l n="540">And , with a fearless mien , Sohrab replied :— 540</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="40">
     <l n="602">He spoke ; and as he ceased , he wept aloud ,</l>
     <l n="603">Thinking of her he left , and his own death .</l>
     <l n="604">He spoke ; but Rustum listen 'd , plunged in thought .</l>
     <l n="605">Nor did he yet believe it was his son 605</l>
     <l n="606">Who spoke , although he call 'd back names he knew ;</l>
     <l n="607">For he had had sure tidings that the babe ,</l>
     <l n="608">Which was in Ader-baijan born to him ,</l>
     <l n="609">Had been a puny girl , no boy at all —</l>
     <l n="610">So that sad mother sent him word , for fear 610</l>
     <l n="611">Rustum should seek the boy , to train in arms —</l>

     <l n="615">So deem 'd he ; yet he listen 'd , plunged in thought 615</l>
     <l n="616">And his soul set to grief , as the vast tide</l>

     <l n="618">At the full moon ; tears gather 'd in his eyes ;</l>
     <l n="619">For he remember 'd his own early youth ,</l>
     <l n="620">And all its bounding rapture ; as , at dawn , 620</l>
     <l n="621">The shepherd from his mountain-lodge descries</l>
     <l n="622">A far , bright city , smitten by the sun ,</l>
     <l n="623">Through many rolling clouds — so Rustum saw</l>
     <l n="624">His youth ; saw Sohrab 's mother , in her bloom ;</l>
     <l n="625">And that old king ,° her father , who loved well ° 625</l>
     <l n="626">His wandering guest , and gave him his fair child</l>
     <l n="627">With joy ; and all the pleasant life they led ,</l>
     <l n="628">They three , in that long-distant summer-time —</l>
     <l n="629">The castle , and the dewy woods , and hunt</l>
     <l n="630">And hound , and morn on those delightful hills 630</l>
     <l n="631">In Ader-baijan . And he saw that Youth ,</l>
     <l n="632">Of age and looks ° to be his own dear son , ° 632</l>
     <l n="633">Piteous and lovely , lying on the sand ;</l>
     <l n="634">Like some rich hyacinth which by the scythe</l>
     <l n="635">Of an unskilful gardener has been cut , 635</l>
     <l n="636">Mowing the garden grass-plots near its bed ,</l>
     <l n="637">And lies , a fragrant tower of purple bloom ,</l>
     <l n="638">On the mown , dying grass — so Sohrab lay ,</l>
     <l n="639">Lovely in death , upon the common sand .</l>
     <l n="640">And Rustum gazed on him with grief , and said :— 640</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="41">
     <l n="641">“ O Sohrab , thou indeed art such a son</l>
     <l n="642">Whom Rustum , wert thou his , might well have loved .</l>
     <l n="643">Yet here thou errest , Sohrab , or else men</l>
     <l n="644">Have told thee false — thou art not Rustum 's son .</l>
     <l n="645">For Rustum had no son ; one child he had — 645</l>
     <l n="646">But one — a girl ; who with her mother now</l>
     <l n="647">Plies some light female task , nor dreams of us —</l>
     <l n="648">Of us she dreams not , nor of wounds , nor war . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="42">
     <l n="649">But Sohrab answer 'd him in wrath ; for now</l>
     <l n="650">The anguish of the deep-fix 'd spear grew fierce , 650</l>
     <l n="651">And he desired to draw forth the steel ,</l>
     <l n="652">And let the blood flow free , and so to die —</l>
     <l n="653">But first he would convince his stubborn foe ;</l>
     <l n="654">And , rising sternly on one arm , he said :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="43">
     <l n="655">“ Man , who art thou who dost deny my words ? 655</l>
     <l n="656">Truth sits upon the lips of dying men ,</l>
     <l n="657">And falsehood , while I lived , was far from mine .</l>
     <l n="658">I tell thee , prick 'd upon this arm ° I bear ° 658</l>
     <l n="659">That seal which Rustum to my mother gave ,</l>
     <l n="660">That she might prick it on the babe she bore . ” 660</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="44">
     <l n="661">He spoke ; and all the blood left Rustum 's cheeks ,</l>
     <l n="662">And his knees totter 'd , and he smote his hand</l>
     <l n="663">Against his breast , his heavy mailed hand ,</l>
     <l n="664">That the hard iron corslet ° clank 'd aloud ; ° 663</l>
     <l n="665">And to his heart he press 'd the other hand , 665</l>
     <l n="666">And in a hollow voice he spake , and said :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="45">
     <l n="667">“ Sohrab , that were a proof which could not lie !</l>
     <l n="668">If thou show this , then art thou Rustum 's son . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="46">
     <l n="669">Then , with weak hasty fingers , Sohrab loosed</l>
     <l n="670">His belt , and near the shoulder bared his arm , 670</l>
     <l n="671">And show 'd a sign in faint vermilion points</l>
     <l n="672">Prick 'd ; as a cunning ° workman , in Pekin , ° 672</l>
     <l n="673">Pricks with vermilion some clear porcelain vase ,</l>
     <l n="674">An emperor 's gift — at early morn he paints ,</l>
     <l n="675">And all day long , and , when night comes , the lamp 675</l>
     <l n="676">Lights up his studious forehead and thin hands —</l>
     <l n="677">So delicately prick 'd the sign appear 'd</l>
     <l n="678">On Sohrab 's arm , the sign of Rustum 's seal .</l>
     <l n="679">It was that griffin ,° which of old rear 'd Zal , ° 679</l>
     <l n="680">Rustum 's great father , whom they left to die , 680</l>
     <l n="681">A helpless babe , among the mountain-rocks ;</l>
     <l n="682">Him that kind creature found , and rear 'd , and loved —</l>
     <l n="683">Then Rustum took it for his glorious sign .</l>
     <l n="684">And Sohrab bared that image on his arm ,</l>
     <l n="685">And himself scann 'd it long with mournful eyes , 685</l>
     <l n="686">And then he touch 'd it with his hand and said :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="47">
     <l n="687">“ How say'st thou ? Is that sign the proper sign</l>
     <l n="688">Of Rustum 's son , or of some other man 's ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="48">
     <l n="689">He spoke ; but Rustum gazed , and gazed , and stood</l>
     <l n="690">Speechless ; and then he utter 'd one sharp cry : 690</l>
     <l n="691">O boy — thy father !— and his voice choked there .</l>
     <l n="692">And then a dark cloud pass 'd before his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="693">And his head swam , and he sank down to earth .</l>
     <l n="694">But Sohrab crawl 'd to where he lay , and cast</l>
     <l n="695">His arms about his neck , and kiss 'd his lips , 695</l>
     <l n="696">And with fond faltering fingers stroked his cheeks ,</l>
     <l n="697">Trying to call him back to life ; and life</l>
     <l n="698">Came back to Rustum , and he oped his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="699">And they stood wide with horror ; and he seized</l>
     <l n="700">In both his hands the dust which lay around , 700</l>
     <l n="701">And threw it on his head , and smirch 'd his hair ,—</l>
     <l n="702">His hair , and face , and beard , and glittering arms ;</l>
     <l n="703">And strong convulsive groanings shook his breast ,</l>
     <l n="704">And his sobs choked him ; and he clutch 'd his sword ,</l>
     <l n="705">To draw it , and for ever let life out . 705</l>
     <l n="706">But Sohrab saw his thought , and held his hands ,</l>
     <l n="707">And with a soothing voice he spake , and said :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="49">
     <l n="708">“ Father , forbear ! for I but meet to-day</l>
     <l n="709">The doom which at my birth was written down</l>
     <l n="710">In Heaven , and thou art Heaven 's unconscious hand .° ° 710</l>
     <l n="711">Surely my heart cried out that it was thou ,</l>
     <l n="712">When first I saw thee ; and thy heart spoke too ,</l>
     <l n="713">I know it ! but fate trod those promptings down</l>
     <l n="714">Under its iron heel ; fate , fate engaged</l>
     <l n="715">The strife , and hurl 'd me on my father 's spear . 715</l>
     <l n="716">But let us speak no more of this ! I find</l>
     <l n="717">My father ; let me feel that I have found !° ° 717</l>
     <l n="718">Come , sit beside me on this sand , and take</l>
     <l n="719">My head betwixt thy hands , and kiss my cheeks ,</l>
     <l n="720">And wash them with thy tears , and say : My son ! 720</l>
     <l n="721">Quick ! quick ! for number 'd are my sands of life ,</l>
     <l n="722">And swift ; for like the lightning to this field</l>
     <l n="723">I came , and like the wind I go away —</l>
     <l n="724">Sudden , and swift , and like a passing wind .° ° 724</l>
     <l n="725">But it was writ in Heaven that this should be . ” 725</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="50">
     <l n="726">So said he , and his voice released the heart</l>
     <l n="727">Of Rustum , and his tears brake forth ; he cast</l>
     <l n="728">His arms round his son 's neck , and wept aloud ,</l>
     <l n="729">And kiss 'd him . And awe fell on both the hosts ,</l>
     <l n="730">When they saw Rustum 's grief ; and Ruksh , the horse , 730</l>
     <l n="731">With his head bowing to the ground and mane</l>
     <l n="732">Sweeping the dust , came near , and in mute woe</l>
     <l n="733">First to the one then to the other moved</l>
     <l n="734">His head , as if inquiring what their grief</l>
     <l n="735">Might mean ; and from his dark , compassionate eyes , 735</l>
     <l n="736">The big warm tears roll 'd down , and caked ° the sand . ° 736</l>
     <l n="737">But Rustum chid him with stern voice , and said :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="51">
     <l n="738">“ Ruksh , now thou grievest ; but , O Ruksh , thy feet</l>
     <l n="739">Should first have rotted on their nimble joints ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="52">
     <l n="741">But Sohrab look 'd upon the horse and said :—</l>
     <l n="742">“ Is this , then , Ruksh ? How often , in past days ,</l>
     <l n="743">My mother told me of thee , thou brave steed ,</l>
     <l n="744">My terrible father 's terrible horse ! and said ,</l>
     <l n="745">That I should one day find thy lord and thee . 745</l>
     <l n="746">Come , let me lay my hand upon thy mane !</l>
     <l n="747">O Ruksh , thou art more fortunate than I ;</l>
     <l n="748">For thou hast gone where I shall never go ,</l>
     <l n="749">And snuff 'd the breezes of my father 's home .</l>
     <l n="750">And thou hast trod the sands of Seistan , 750</l>
     <l n="751">And seen the River of Helmund ,° and the Lake ° 751</l>
     <l n="752">Of Zirrah °; and the aged Zal himself ° 752</l>
     <l n="753">Has often stroked thy neck , and given thee food ,</l>
     <l n="754">Corn in a golden platter soak 'd with wine ,</l>
     <l n="755">And said : O Ruksh ! bear Rustum well !— but I 755</l>
     <l n="756">Have never known my grandsire 's furrow 'd face ,</l>
     <l n="757">Nor seen his lofty house in Seistan ,</l>
     <l n="758">Nor slaked my thirst at the clear Helmund stream ;</l>
     <l n="759">But lodged among my father 's foes , and seen</l>
     <l n="760">Afrasiab 's cities only , Samarcand , 760</l>
     <l n="761">Bokhara , and lone Khiva in the waste ,</l>
     <l n="762">And the black Toorkmun tents ; and only drunk</l>
     <l n="763">The desert rivers , Moorghab ° and Tejend ,° ° 763</l>
     <l n="764">Kohik ,° and where the Kalmuks feed their sheep ,</l>

     <l n="767">Then , with a heavy groan , Rustum bewail 'd :—</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="54">
     <l n="771">But , with a grave mild voice , Sohrab replied :—</l>

     <l n="781">They follow 'd me , my hope , my fame , my star .</l>
     <l n="782">Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace .</l>
     <l n="783">But me thou must bear hence , not send with them ,</l>
     <l n="784">But carry me with thee to Seistan ,</l>

     <l n="808">What should I do with slaying any more ?</l>
     <l n="809">For would that all that I have ever slain</l>

     <l n="815">So thou mightest live too , my son , my son ! 815</l>
     <l n="816">Or rather would that I , even I myself ,</l>

     <l n="827">Then , at the point of death , Sohrab replied :—</l>

     <l n="846">By children whom their nurses call with haste .</l>
     <l n="847">Indoors from the sun 's eye ; his head droop 'd low ,</l>

     <l n="851">Convulsed him back to life , he open 'd them ,</l>
     <l n="852">And fix 'd them feebly on his father 's face ;</l>
     <l n="853">Till now all strength was ebb 'd , and from his limbs</l>
     <l n="854">Unwillingly the spirit fled away ,</l>

     <l n="137">Yet were it lifted to the light ,</l>
     <l n="138">The sweet expression of her brow</l>
     <l n="139">Would charm the gazer , till his thought</l>
     <l n="140">Erased the ravages of time , 140</l>
     <l n="141">Fill 'd up the hollow cheek , and brought</l>
     <l n="142">A freshness back as of her prime —</l>
     <l n="143">So healing is her quiet now .</l>
     <l n="144">So perfectly the lines express</l>
     <l n="145">A tranquil , settled loveliness , 145</l>
     <l n="146">Her younger rival 's purest grace .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="147">The air of the December-night</l>
     <l n="148">Steals coldly around the chamber bright ,</l>

     <l n="150">Swinging with it , in the light 150</l>
     <l n="151">Flaps the ghostlike tapestry .</l>
     <l n="152">And on the arras wrought you see</l>
     <l n="153">A stately Huntsman , clad in green ,</l>
     <l n="154">And round him a fresh forest-scene .</l>
     <l n="155">On that clear forest-knoll he stays , 155</l>
     <l n="156">With his pack round him , and delays .</l>

     <l n="162">With heated cheeks and flurried air ,</l>

    <head>ISEULT OF BRITTANY °</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A year had flown , and o'er the sea away ,</l>
     <l n="2">In Cornwall , Tristram and Queen Iseult lay ;</l>
     <l n="3">In King Marc 's chapel , in Tyntagel old —</l>
     <l n="4">There in a ship they bore those lovers cold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The young surviving Iseult , one bright day , 5</l>
     <l n="6">Had wander 'd forth . Her children were at play</l>
     <l n="7">In a green circular hollow in the heath</l>
     <l n="8">Which borders the sea-shore — a country path</l>
     <l n="9">Creeps over it from the till 'd fields behind .</l>
     <l n="10">The hollow 's grassy banks are soft-inclined , 10</l>
     <l n="11">And to one standing on them , far and near</l>
     <l n="12">The lone unbroken view spreads bright and clear</l>
     <l n="13">Over the waste . This cirque ° of open ground ° 13</l>
     <l n="14">Is light and green ; the heather , which all round</l>
     <l n="15">Creeps thickly , grows not here ; but the pale grass 15</l>
     <l n="16">Is strewn with rocks , and many a shiver 'd mass</l>
     <l n="17">Of vein 'd white-gleaming quartz , and here and there</l>
     <l n="18">Dotted with holly-trees and juniper .° ° 18</l>
     <l n="19">In the smooth centre of the opening stood</l>
     <l n="20">Three hollies side by side , and made a screen , 20</l>
     <l n="21">Warm with the winter-sun , of burnish 'd green</l>
     <l n="22">With scarlet berries gemm 'd , the fell-fare 's ° food . ° 22</l>
     <l n="23">Under the glittering hollies Iseult stands ,</l>
     <l n="24">Watching her children play ; their little hands</l>
     <l n="25">Are busy gathering spars of quartz , and streams 25</l>
     <l n="26">Of stagshorn ° for their hats ; anon , with screams ° 26</l>
     <l n="27">Of mad delight they drop their spoils , and bound</l>
     <l n="28">Among the holly-clumps and broken ground ,</l>
     <l n="29">Racing full speed , and startling in their rush</l>
     <l n="30">The fell-fares and the speckled missel-thrush 30</l>
     <l n="31">Out of their glossy coverts ;— but when now</l>
     <l n="32">Their cheeks were flush 'd , and over each hot brow ,</l>
     <l n="33">Under the feather 'd hats of the sweet pair ,</l>
     <l n="34">In blinding masses shower 'd the golden hair —</l>
     <l n="35">Then Iseult call 'd them to her , and the three 35</l>
     <l n="36">Cluster 'd under the holly-screen , and she</l>
     <l n="37">Told them an old-world Breton history .° ° 37</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="38">Warm in their mantles wrapt the three stood there ,</l>
     <l n="39">Under the hollies , in the clear still air —</l>
     <l n="40">Mantles with those rich furs deep glistering 40</l>
     <l n="41">Which Venice ships do from swart Egypt bring .</l>
     <l n="42">Long they stay 'd still — then , pacing at their ease ,</l>
     <l n="43">Moved up and down under the glossy trees .</l>
     <l n="44">But still , as they pursued their warm dry road ,</l>
     <l n="45">From Iseult 's lips the unbroken story flow 'd , 45</l>
     <l n="46">And still the children listen 'd , their blue eyes</l>
     <l n="47">Fix 'd on their mother 's face in wide surprise ;</l>
     <l n="48">Nor did their looks stray once to the sea-side ,</l>
     <l n="49">Nor to the brown heaths round them , bright and wide ,</l>
     <l n="50">Nor to the snow , which , though ‘ twas all away 50</l>
     <l n="51">From the open heath , still by the hedgerows lay ,</l>
     <l n="52">Nor to the shining sea-fowl , that with screams</l>
     <l n="53">Bore up from where the bright Atlantic gleams ,</l>
     <l n="54">Swooping to landward ; nor to where , quite clear ,</l>
     <l n="55">The fell-fares settled on the thickets near . 55</l>
     <l n="56">And they would still have listen 'd , till dark night</l>
     <l n="57">Came keen and chill down on the heather bright ;</l>
     <l n="58">But , when the red glow on the sea grew cold ,</l>
     <l n="59">And the grey turrets of the castle old</l>
     <l n="60">Look 'd sternly through the frosty evening-air , 60</l>
     <l n="61">Then Iseult took by the hand those children fair ,</l>
     <l n="62">And brought her tale to an end , and found the path ,</l>
     <l n="63">And led them home over the darkening heath .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="64">And is she happy ? Does she see unmoved</l>
     <l n="65">The days in which she might have lived and loved 65</l>
     <l n="66">Slip without bringing bliss slowly away ,</l>
     <l n="67">One after one , to-morrow like to-day ?</l>
     <l n="68">Joy has not found her yet , nor ever will —</l>
     <l n="69">Is it this thought which , makes her mien so still ,</l>
     <l n="70">Her features so fatigued , her eyes , though sweet , 70</l>
     <l n="71">So sunk , so rarely lifted save to meet</l>
     <l n="72">Her children 's ? She moves slow ; her voice alone</l>
     <l n="73">Hath yet an infantine and silver tone ,</l>
     <l n="74">But even that comes languidly ; in truth ,</l>
     <l n="75">She seems one dying in a mask of youth . 75</l>
     <l n="76">And now she will go home , and softly lay</l>
     <l n="77">Her laughing children in their beds , and play</l>
     <l n="78">Awhile with them before they sleep ; and then</l>
     <l n="79">She 'll light her silver lamp , which fishermen</l>
     <l n="80">Dragging their nets through the rough waves , afar , 80</l>
     <l n="81">Along this iron coast ,° know like a star ,° ° 81</l>
     <l n="82">And take her broidery-frame , and there she 'll sit</l>
     <l n="83">Hour after hour , her gold curls sweeping it ;</l>
     <l n="84">Lifting her soft-bent head only to mind</l>
     <l n="85">Her children , or to listen to the wind . 85</l>
     <l n="86">And when the clock peals midnight , she will move</l>
     <l n="87">Her work away , and let her fingers rove</l>
     <l n="88">Across the shaggy brows of Tristram 's hound</l>
     <l n="89">Who lies , guarding her feet , along the ground ;</l>
     <l n="90">Or else she will fall musing , her blue eyes 90</l>
     <l n="91">Fixt , her slight hands clasp 'd on her lap ; then rise ,</l>
     <l n="92">And at her prie-dieu ° kneel , until she have told ° 92</l>
     <l n="93">Her rosary-beads of ebony tipp 'd with gold ,</l>
     <l n="94">Then to her soft sleep — and to-morrow 'll be</l>
     <l n="95">To-day 's exact repeated effigy . 95</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="96">Yes , it is lonely for her in her hall .</l>
     <l n="97">The children , and the grey-hair 'd seneschal ,° ° 97</l>
     <l n="98">Her women , and Sir Tristram 's aged hound ,</l>
     <l n="99">Are there the sole companions to be found .</l>
     <l n="100">But these she loves ; and noiser life than this 100</l>
     <l n="101">She would find ill to bear , weak as she is .</l>
     <l n="102">She has her children , too , and night and day</l>
     <l n="103">Is with them ; and the wide heaths where they play ,</l>
     <l n="104">The hollies , and the cliff , and the sea-shore ,</l>
     <l n="105">The sand , the sea-birds , and the distant sails , 105</l>
     <l n="106">These are to her dear as to them ; the tales</l>
     <l n="107">With which this day the children she beguiled</l>
     <l n="108">She gleaned from Breton grandames , when a child ,</l>
     <l n="109">In every hut along this sea-coast wild .</l>
     <l n="110">She herself loves them still , and , when they are told , 110</l>
     <l n="111">Can forget all to hear them , as of old .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="112">Dear saints , it is not sorrow , as I hear ,</l>
     <l n="113">Not suffering , which shuts up eye and ear</l>
     <l n="114">To all that has delighted them before ,</l>
     <l n="115">And lets us be what we were once no more . 115</l>
     <l n="116">No , we may suffer deeply , yet retain</l>
     <l n="117">Power to be moved and soothed , for all our pain ,</l>
     <l n="118">By what of old pleased us , and will again .</l>
     <l n="119">No , ‘ tis the gradual furnace of the world ,</l>
     <l n="120">In whose hot air our spirits are upcurl 'd 120</l>
     <l n="121">Until they crumble , or else grow like steel —</l>
     <l n="122">Which kills in us the bloom , the youth , the spring —</l>
     <l n="123">Which leaves the fierce necessity to feel ,</l>
     <l n="124">But takes away the power — this can avail ,</l>
     <l n="125">By drying up our joy in everything , 125</l>
     <l n="126">To make our former pleasures all seem stale .</l>
     <l n="127">This , or some tyrannous single thought , some fit</l>
     <l n="128">Of passion , which subdues our souls to it ,</l>
     <l n="129">Till for its sake alone we live and move —</l>
     <l n="130">Call it ambition , or remorse , or love — 130</l>
     <l n="131">This too can change us wholly , and make seem</l>

     <l n="133">And yet , I swear , it angers me to see</l>

     <l n="135">Being , in truth , but a diseased unrest , 135</l>
     <l n="136">And an unnatural overheat at best .</l>
     <l n="137">How they are full of languor and distress</l>
     <l n="138">Not having it ; which when they do possess ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="167">Blowing between the stems , the forest-air</l>
     <l n="168">Had loosen 'd the brown locks of Vivian 's hair ,</l>
     <l n="169">Which play 'd on her flush 'd cheek , and her blue eyes</l>
     <l n="170">Sparkled with mocking glee and exercise .</l>
     <l n="171">Her palfrey 's flanks were mired and bathed in sweat , 170</l>
     <l n="172">For they had travell 'd far and not stopp 'd yet .</l>
     <l n="173">A brier in that tangled wilderness</l>
     <l n="174">Had scored her white right hand , which she allows</l>
     <l n="175">To rest ungloved on her green riding-dress ;</l>
     <l n="176">The other warded off the drooping boughs . 175</l>
     <l n="177">But still she chatted on , with her blue eyes</l>
     <l n="178">Fix 'd full on Merlin 's face , her stately prize .</l>
     <l n="179">Her ‘ haviour had the morning 's fresh clear grace ,</l>
     <l n="180">The spirit of the woods was in her face .</l>
     <l n="181">She look 'd so witching fair , that learned wight 180</l>
     <l n="182">Forgot his craft , and his best wits took flight ;</l>
     <l n="183">And he grew fond , and eager to obey</l>
     <l n="184">His mistress , use her empire ° as she may . ° 184</l>
     <l n="185">They came to where the brushwood ceased , and day 185</l>
     <l n="186">Peer 'd ‘ twixt the stems ; and the ground broke away ,</l>
     <l n="187">In a sloped sward down to a brawling brook ;</l>

     <l n="189">On the brook 's farther side was clear , but then</l>
     <l n="190">The underwood and trees began again . 190</l>
     <l n="191">This open glen was studded thick with thorns</l>
     <l n="192">Then white with blossom ; and you saw the horns ,</l>
     <l n="193">Through last year 's fern , of the shy fallow-deer</l>
     <l n="194">Who come at noon down to the water here .</l>
     <l n="195">You saw the bright-eyed squirrels dart along 195</l>
     <l n="196">Under the thorns on the green sward ; and strong</l>
     <l n="197">The blackbird whistled from the dingles near ,</l>
     <l n="198">And the weird chipping of the woodpecker</l>
     <l n="199">Rang lonelily and sharp ; the sky was fair ,</l>
     <l n="200">And a fresh breath of spring stirr 'd everywhere . 200</l>
     <l n="201">Merlin and Vivian stopp 'd on the slope 's brow ,</l>
     <l n="202">To gaze on the light sea of leaf and bough</l>
     <l n="203">Which glistering plays all round them , lone and mild .</l>
     <l n="204">As if to itself the quiet forest smiled .</l>
     <l n="205">Upon the brow-top grew a thorn , and here 205</l>
     <l n="206">The grass was dry and moss 'd , and you saw clear</l>
     <l n="207">Across the hollow ; white anemones</l>
     <l n="208">Starr 'd the cool turf , and clumps of primroses</l>
     <l n="209">Ran out from the dark underwood behind .</l>
     <l n="210">No fairer resting-place a man could find . 210</l>
     <l n="211">“ Here let us halt , ” said Merlin then ; and she</l>
     <l n="212">Nodded , and tied her palfrey to a tree .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="213">They sate them down together , and a sleep</l>
     <l n="214">Fell upon Merlin , more like death , so deep .</l>
     <l n="215">Her finger on her lips , then Vivian rose 215</l>
     <l n="216">And from her brown-lock 'd head the wimple throws ,</l>
     <l n="217">And takes it in her hand , and waves it over</l>
     <l n="218">The blossom 'd thorn-tree and her sleeping lover .</l>
     <l n="219">Nine times she waved the fluttering wimple ° round , ° 219</l>

    <head>A DREAM</head>
     <l n="1">Was it a dream ? We sail 'd , I thought we sail 'd ,</l>
     <l n="2">Martin and I , down the green Alpine stream ,</l>
     <l n="3">Border 'd , each bank , with pines ; the morning sun ,</l>
     <l n="4">On the wet umbrage of their glossy tops ,</l>
     <l n="5">On the red pinings of their forest-floor , 5</l>
     <l n="6">Drew a warm scent abroad ; behind the pines</l>
     <l n="7">The mountain-skirts , with all their sylvan change</l>
     <l n="8">Of bright-leaf 'd chestnuts and moss 'd walnut-trees</l>
     <l n="9">And the frail scarlet-berried ash , began .</l>
     <l n="10">Swiss chalets glitter 'd on the dewy slopes , 10</l>
     <l n="11">And from some swarded shelf , high up , there came</l>
     <l n="12">Notes of wild pastoral music — over all</l>
     <l n="13">Ranged , diamond-bright , the eternal wall of snow .</l>
     <l n="14">Upon the mossy rocks at the stream 's edge ,</l>
     <l n="15">Back 'd by the pines , a plank-built cottage stood , 15</l>
     <l n="16">Bright in the sun ; the climbing gourd-plant 's leaves</l>
     <l n="17">Muffled its walls , and on the stone-strewn roof</l>
     <l n="18">Lay the warm golden gourds ; golden , within ,</l>
     <l n="19">Under the eaves , peer 'd rows of Indian corn .</l>
     <l n="20">We shot beneath the cottage with the stream . 20</l>
     <l n="21">On the brown , rude-carved balcony , two forms</l>
     <l n="22">Came forth — Olivia 's , Marguerite ! and thine .</l>
     <l n="23">Clad were they both in white , flowers in their breast ;</l>
     <l n="24">Straw hats bedeck 'd their heads , with ribbons blue ,</l>
     <l n="25">Which danced , and on their shoulders , fluttering , play 'd . 25</l>
     <l n="26">They saw us , they conferred ; their bosoms heaved ,</l>
     <l n="27">And more than mortal impulse fill 'd their eyes .</l>
     <l n="28">Their lips moved ; their white arms , waved eagerly ,</l>
     <l n="29">Flash 'd once , like falling streams ; we rose , we gazed .</l>
     <l n="30">One moment , on the rapid 's top , our boat 30</l>
     <l n="31">Hung poised — and then the darting river of Life</l>
     <l n="32">( Such now , methought , it was ) , the river of Life ,</l>
     <l n="33">Loud thundering , bore us by ; swift , swift it foam 'd ,</l>
     <l n="34">Black under cliffs it raced , round headlands shone .</l>
     <l n="35">Soon the plank 'd cottage by the sun-warm 'd pines 35</l>
     <l n="36">Faded — the moss — the rocks ; us burning plains ,</l>
     <l n="37">Bristled with cities , us the sea received .</l>

   <p>NOTES</p>
   <p>SOHRAB AND RUSTUM</p>
   <p>“ I am occupied with a thing that gives me more pleasure than anything I have ever done yet , which is a good sign , but whether I shall not ultimately spoil it by being obliged to strike it off in fragments instead of at one heat , I cannot quite say . ” ( Arnold , in a letter to Mrs. Foster , April , 1853 . )</p>
   <p>“ All my spare time has been spent on a poem which I have just finished and which I think by far the best thing I have yet done , and I think it will be generally liked ; though one can never be sure of this . I have had the greatest pleasure in composing it , a rare thing with me , and , as I think , a good test of the pleasure what you write is likely to afford to others . But the story is a very noble and excellent one . ” ( Arnold , in a letter to his mother , May , 1853 . )</p>
   <p>The following synopsis of the story of Sohrab and Rustum the “ tale replete with tears , ” is gathered from several sources , chiefly Benjamin 's Persia , in The Story of the Nations , Sir John Malcolm 's History of Persia , and the great Persian epic poem , Shah Nameh . The Shah Nameh the original source of the story , and which purports to narrate the exploits of Persia 's kings and champions over a space of thirty-six centuries , bears the same relation to Persian literature as the Iliad and Odyssey to the Greek , and the Æneid to the Latin , though in structure it more nearly resembles Morte d'Arthur , which records in order the achievements of various heroes . In it the native poet Mansur ibn Ahmad , afterwards known to literature as Firdausi , the Paradisaical , has set down the early tales and traditions of his people with all the vividness and color common to oriental writers . The principal hero of the poem is the mighty Rustum , who , mounted on his famous horse Ruksh , performed prodigies of valor in defence of the Persian throne . Of all his adventures his encounter with Sohrab is the most dramatic . The poem was probably written in the latter half of the tenth century . As will be seen , the incidents narrated in Arnold 's poem form but an episode in the complete story of the two champions .<span type="note_anchor">[ 150 ]</span></p>
   <p>Rustum ( or Rustem ) , having killed a wild ass while hunting on the Turanian frontier , and having feasted on its flesh , composed himself to sleep , leaving his faithful steed , Ruksh ( or Raksh ) , to graze untethered . On awakening , he found his horse had disappeared , and believing it had been stolen , the warrior proceeded towards Semenjan , a near-by city , in hopes of recovering his property . On the way , he learned that Ruksh had been found by the servants of the king and was stabled at Semenjan , as he had surmised . Upon Rustum 's demand , the steed was promptly restored to him , and he was about to depart when he was prevailed upon to accept the king 's invitation to tarry awhile and rest himself in feasting and idleness .</p>
   <p>Now the king of Semenjan had a fair daughter named Tahmineh , who had become enamoured of Rustum because of his mighty exploits . Susceptible as she was beautiful , she made her attachment so evident that the young hero , who was as ardent as he was brave , readily yielded to the power of her fascination . The consent of the king having been obtained , Rustum and Tahmineh were married with all the rites prescribed by the laws of the country . A peculiar feature of this alliance lay in the fact that the king of Semenjan was feudatory to Afrasiab , the deadly enemy of Persia , while Rustum was her greatest champion . At this time , however , the two countries were at peace .<span type="note_anchor">[ 151 ]</span>For a time all went happily , then Rustum found it necessary to leave his bride , as he thought , for only a short time . At parting he gave her an onyx , which he wore on his arm , bidding her , if a daughter should be born to their union , to twine the gem in her hair under a fortunate star ; but if a son , to bind it on his arm , and he would be insured a glorious career . Rustum then mounted Ruksh and rode away — as time proved , never to return .</p>
   <p>The months went by , and to the lonely bride was born a marvellous son , whom , because of his comely features , she named Sohrab . Fearing Rustum would send for the boy when he grew older , and thus rob her of her treasure , Tahmineh sent word to him that the child was a girl — “ no son , ” and Rustum took no further interest in it .</p>
   <p>While still of tender years , Sohrab showed signs of his noble lineage . He early displayed a love for horses , and at the age of ten years , according to the tradition , was large and handsome and highly accomplished in the use of arms . Realizing at length that he was of lofty descent , he insisted that his mother , who had concealed the fact , should inform him of the name of his father . Being told that it was the renowned Rustum , he exclaimed , “ Since he is my father , I shall go to his aid ; he shall become king of Persia and together we shall rule the world . ” After this the youth caused a horse worthy of him to be found , and with the aid of his grandfather , the king of Semenjan , he prepared to go on the quest , attended by a mighty host .</p>
   <p>When Afrasiab , the Turanian ruler , learned that Sohrab was going to war with the Persians , he was greatly pleased , and after counselling with his wise men , decided openly to assist him in his enterprises , with the expectation that both Rustum and Sohrab would fall in battle and Persia be at his mercy . He accordingly sent an army of auxiliaries to Sohrab , accompanied by two astute courtiers , Houman and Barman , who , under the guise of friendship , were to act as counsellors to the young leader . These he ordered to keep the knowledge of their relationship from father and son and to seek to bring about an encounter between them , in the hope that Sohrab would slay Rustum , Afrasiab 's most dreaded foeman , after which the unsuspecting youth might easily be disposed of by treachery .<span type="note_anchor">[ 152 ]</span></p>
   <p>Sohrab , with his army and that of Afrasiab , set out , intending to fight his way until Rustum should be sent against him , when he would reveal himself to his father and form an alliance with him that would place the line of Seistan on the throne . On the way southward , Sohrab overthrew and captured the Persian champion , Hujir , and the same day conquered the warrior maiden Gurdafrid , whose beauty and tears , however , prevailed upon him to release her . Guzdehern , father of Gurdafrid , recognizing Sohrab 's prowess , and alarmed for the safety of the Persian throne , secretly despatched a courier to the king Kai Kaoos to warn him of the young Tartar 's approach . Kaoos , in great terror , sent for Rustum to hurry to his aid . Regardless of the king 's request , Rustum spent eight days in feasting , then presented himself at the court . Kaoos , angered at the delay , ordered both the champion and the messenger to be executed forthwith ; but Rustum effected his escape on Ruksh , and returned to Seistan , leaving Persia to her fate . The king 's wrath , however , soon gave place to fear ; and recognizing the danger of his throne unsupported by Rustum 's valor , he despatched messengers to him with humble petitions and apologies . After much protesting , Rustum finally yielded and accompanied the Persian army , under the king Kai Kaoos , which at once set forth to encounter Sohrab .</p>
   <p>The morning before the opening of hostilities , Sohrab , taking the Persian Hujir , whom he still held a prisoner , to the top of a rocky eminence , ordered him to point out the tents of the chief warriors of the Persian army , particularly Rustum 's . But Hujir , fearing lest Sohrab should attack Rustum unexpectedly and so overcome him , declared that the great chieftain 's tent was not among those on the plain below . Disappointed at his failure to find his father , Sohrab led his army in a fierce onslaught on the Persians , driving them in confusion before him . In this dire extremity Kai Kaoos sent for Rustum , who was somewhat apart from the main troop . Exclaiming that the king never sent for him except when he had got himself into trouble , the warrior armed , mounted Ruksh , and rushed to the combat . By mutual consent the two champions withdrew to a retired spot , where , unmolested , they might fight out their quarrel hand to hand . As they approached each other , Rustum , moved with compassion by the youth of his foe , tried to dissuade Sohrab from his purpose , and counselled him to retire . Sohrab , filled with sudden hope ,— an instinctive feeling that the father whom he was seeking stood before him ,— eagerly demanded whether this were Rustum . But Rustum , fearing treachery , said he was only an ordinary man , having neither palace nor princely kingdom — not Rustum .</p>
   <p>They marked off the lists , and , mounted on their powerful horses , fought first with javelins , then with swords , clubs , and bows and arrows . After several hours of fighting both were exhausted , and by tacit consent they retired to opposite sides of the lists for rest . When the combat was renewed , Sohrab gained a slight advantage . A truce was then made for the night , and the warriors returned to their tents to prepare for the morrow .</p>
   <p>With daybreak the struggle was renewed . To prevent the armies from intervening or engaging in battle , they were removed to a distance of several miles . Midway between , Sohrab and Rustum met in the midst of a lonely , treeless waste . More convinced than before that his adversary was Rustum , Sohrab sought to bring about a reconciliation , but Rustum refused . This time they fought on foot . From morning till afternoon they fought , neither gaining any decided advantage . At last Sohrab succeeded in felling Rustum to the earth , and was about to slay him , when the Persian called out that it was not the custom in chivalrous warfare to slay a champion until he was thrown the second time . Sohrab , generous as brave , released his prostrate foe ; and again father and son parted .<span type="note_anchor">[ 154 ]</span></p>
   <p>Rustum , scarcely believing himself alive after such an escape , purified himself with water , and prayed that his wounds might be healed and his accustomed strength restored to him . Never before had he been so beset in battle .</p>
   <p>With morning came the renewal of the combat , both champions determining to end it that day . Late in the evening Rustum , by a supreme effort , seized Sohrab around the waist and hurled him to the ground . Then , fearing lest the youth prove too strong for him in the end , he drew his blade and plunged it into Sohrab 's bosom .</p>
   <p>Sohrab forgave Rustum , but warned him to beware the vengeance of his father , the mighty Rustum , who must soon learn that he had slain his son Sohrab . “ I went out to seek my father , ” cried the dying youth , “ for my mother had told me by what tokens I should know him , and I perish for longing after him .... Yet I say unto thee , if thou shouldst become a fish that swimmeth in the depths of the ocean , if thou shouldst change into a star that is concealed in the farthest heaven , my father would draw thee forth from thy hiding-place , and avenge my death upon thee , when he shall learn that the earth is become my bed . For my father is Rustum the Pehliva , and it shall be told unto him , how that Sohrab his son perished in the quest after his face . ” These words were as death to the aged hero , who fell senseless at the side of his wounded son . When he had recovered he called in despair for proofs of what Sohrab had said . The now dying youth tore open his mail and showed his father the onyx which his mother had bound on his arm as directed .<span type="note_anchor">[ 155 ]</span></p>
   <p>The sight of his own signet rendered Rustum quite frantic ; he cursed himself , and would have put an end to his existence but for the efforts of his expiring son . After Sohrab 's death he burnt his tents and carried the corpse to his father 's home in Seistan , and buried it there . The Tartar army , agreeable to Sohrab 's last request , was permitted to return home unmolested . When the tidings of Sohrab 's death reached his mother , she was inconsolable , and died in less than a year .</p>
   <p>In the main the story as told by Arnold follows the original narrative . A careful investigation of the alterations made , and the effect thus produced , will lend added interest to the study of the poem and give ample theme for composition work .</p>
   <p>= 1 . And the first grey of morning fill 'd the east .= Note the abrupt opening . What is gained by its use ? At what point in the story as told in the introductory note does the poem take up the narrative ? Be sure to get a clear mental picture of the initiative scene .

It takes its source in Lake Sir-i-Kol , in the Pamir table-land , at a height of 15 , 600 feet , flows northwest , and empties into the Aral Sea on the south . Its length is about 1300 miles .</p>
   <p>“ The introduction of the tranquil pictures of the Oxus , both at the beginning and close of the poem ( ll . 875-892 ) , flowing steadily on , unmoved by the tragedy which has been enacted on her shore , forms one of the most artistic features in the setting of the poem . ”</p>

    <head>In this poem Arnold has vividly presented a quaint legend of Judas Iscariot , popular in the Middle Ages . Saint Brandan ( 490-577 ) was a celebrated Irish monk , famous for his voyages . “ According to the legendary accounts of his travels , he set sail with others to seek the terrestrial paradise which was supposed to exist in an island of the Atlantic . Various miracles are related of the voyage , but they are always connected with the great island where the monks are said to have landed . The legend was current in the time of Columbus and long after , and many connected St. Brandan 's island with the newly discovered America .

   <p>THE FORSAKEN MERMAN</p>
   <p>“ The title of this poem inevitably brings to mind Tennyson 's two poems , The Merman and The Mermaid . A comparison will show that , in this instance at least , the Oxford poet has touched his subject not less melodiously and with finer and deeper feeling .— Margaret will not listen to her ‘ Children 's voices , wild with pain ’ ;— dearer to her is the selfish desire to save her own soul than is the light in the eyes of her little Mermaiden , dearer than the love of the king of the sea , who yearns for her with sorrow-laden heart . Here is there an infinite tenderness and an infinite tragedy . ” — L. DUPONT SYLE , From Milton to Tennyson .</p>
   <p>Legends of this kind abound among the sea-loving Gaelic and Cymric people . Nowhere , perhaps , have they been given a more pleasing and touching expression than in Arnold 's poem . Note carefully the dramatic manner in which the pathos of the story is presented and developed .</p>

   <p>In his work on Matthew Arnold , George Saintsbury speaks of this poem as follows : “ It is , I believe , not so ‘ correct ’ as it once was to admire this [ poem ] ; but I confess indocility to correctness , at least the correctness which varies with fashion . The Forsaken Merman is not a perfect poem — it has tongueurs , though it is not long ; it has its inadequacies , those incompetences of expression which are so oddly characteristic of its author ; and his elaborate simplicity , though more at home here than in some other places , occasionally gives a dissonance . But it is a great poem ,— one by itself ,— one which finds and keeps its own place in the fore-ordained gallery or museum , with which every true lover of poetry is provided , though he inherits it by degrees . None , I suppose , will deny its pathos ; I should be sorry for any one who fails to perceive its beauty . The brief picture of the land , and the fuller one of the sea , and that ( more elaborate still ) of the occupations of the fugitive , all have their charm . But the triumph of the piece is in one of those metrical coups , which give the triumph of all the greatest poetry , in the sudden change from the slower movements of the earlier stanzas , or strophes , to the quicker sweep of the famous conclusions . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 167 ]</span>What is the opening situation in the poem ? Have the merman and his children just reached the shore , or have they been there some time ? Why so ? Why does the merman still linger , when he is convinced that further delay will count for nothing ? Why does he urge the children to call ? What is shown by his repeated question — “ was it yesterday ” ? Tell the story of Margaret 's departure for the upper world , and discuss the validity of her reason for going . Do you think she intended to return ? What is the significance of her smile just before departing ? Give a word picture of what the sea-folk saw as they lingered in the churchyard . Will Margaret ever grieve for the past ? If so , when ? Why ? Who has your sympathy most , Margaret , the forsaken merman , or the children ? Why ? Do you condemn Margaret for the way she has done , or do you feel she was justified in her actions ? Discuss the versification , giving special attention to its effect on the movement of the poem .</p>
   <p>TRISTRAM AND ISEULT</p>
   <p>The story of Tristram and Iseult is one of the most vivid and passionate of the Arthurian cycle of legends , and is a favorite with the poets . The following version is abridged from Dunlop 's History of Fiction .</p>
   <p>“ In the court of his uncle , King Marc , the king of Cornwall , who at this time resided at the castle of Tyntagel , Tristram became expert in all knightly exercises .... The king of Ireland , at Tristram 's solicitation , promised to bestow his daughter Iseult in marriage on King Marc .... The mother of Iseult gave to her daughter 's confidante a philtre , or love-potion , to be administered on the night of her nuptials . Of this beverage Tristram and Iseult unfortunately partook . Its influence , during the remainder of their lives , regulated the affections and destiny of the lovers .<span type="note_anchor">[ 168 ]</span>“ After the arrival of Tristram and Iseult in Cornwall , and the nuptials of the latter with King Marc , a great part of the romance is occupied with their contrivances to procure secret interviews ... Tristram , being forced to leave Cornwall on account of the displeasure of his uncle , repaired to Brittany , where lived Iseult with the White Hands . He married her , more out of gratitude than love . Afterwards he proceeded to the dominions of Arthur which became the theatre of unnumbered exploits .</p>
   <p>“ Tristram , subsequent to these events , returned to Brittany and to his long-neglected wife . There , being wounded and sick , he was soon reduced to the lowest ebb . In this situation he despatched a confidant to the queen of Cornwall to try if he could induce her to follow him to Brittany .</p>
   <p>“ Meanwhile Tristram awaited the arrival of the queen with such impatience that he employed one of his wife 's damsels to watch at the harbor . Through her , Iseult learned Tristram 's secret , and filled with jealousy , flew to her husband as the vessel which bore the queen of Cornwall was wafted toward the harbor , and reported that the sails were black ( the signal that Iseult , Marc 's queen , had refused Tristram 's request to come to him ) . Tristram , penetrated with inexpressible grief , died . The account of Tristram 's death was the first intelligence which the queen of Cornwall heard on landing . She was conducted to his chamber , and expired holding him in her arms . ”</p>
   <p>= 1 . Is she not come ?= That is , Iseult of Ireland . Arnold 's poem takes up the story at the point where Tristram , now on his death-bed , is watching eagerly for the coming of Iseult , Marc 's queen , for whom he had sent his confidant to Cornwall . Evidently he has just awakened and is still somewhat confused ; see l. 7 . Surely none will fail to appreciate so dramatic a situation .</p>

    <head>PART II</head>
    <head>With the opening of Part II the lovers are restored to each other . The dying Tristram , worn with fever and impatient with long waiting , unjustly charges Iseult with cruelty for not having come to him with greater haste . Her gentle , loving words , however , quickly dispel his doubts as to her loyalty to her former vows . A complete reconciliation takes place , and they die in each other 's embrace . The picture of the Huntsman on the arras is one of the most notable in English poetry .</head>

   <p>PHILOMELA</p>
   <p>“ Philomela unites the sensibilities and intellectual experience of modern Englishmen with the luminousness and simplicity of Greek poetry . ” — SAINTSBURY .</p>
   <p>The myth of the nightingale has long been a favorite with the poets , who have variously interpreted the bird 's song . See Coleridge 's , Keats 's , and Wordsworth 's poems on the subject . The most common version of the myth , the one followed by Arnold , is as follows :—</p>
   <p>“ Pandion ( son of Erichthonius , special ward to Minerva ) had two daughters , Procne and Philomela , of whom he gave the former in marriage to Tereus , king of Thrace ( or of Daulis in Phocis ) . This ruler , after his wife had borne him a son , Itys ( or Itylus ) , wearied of her , plucked out her tongue by the roots to insure her silence , and , pretending that she was dead , took in marriage the other sister , Philomela . Procne , by means of a web , into which she wove her story , informed Philomela of the horrible truth . In revenge upon Tereus , the sisters killed Itylus , and served up the child as food to the father ; but the gods , in indignation , transformed Procne into a swallow , Philomela into a nightingale , forever bemoaning the murdered Itylus , and Tereus into a hawk , forever pursuing the sisters . ” — GAYLEY 'S Classic Myths .</p>

     <l n="2">PALLADIUM</l>
   </lg>
   <p>At the time of the Trojan war there was in the citadel of Troy a celebrated statue of Pallas Athene , called the Palladium . It was reputed to have fallen from heaven as the gift of Zeus , and the belief was that the city could not be taken so long as this statue remained within it . Ulysses and Diomedes , two of the Greek champions , succeeded in entering the city in disguise , stole the Palladium and carried it off to the besiegers ’ camp at Argos . It was some time , however , before the city fell .</p>
   <p>= 1 . Simois .= A small river of the Troad which takes its rise in the rocky , wooded eminence which , according to Greek tradition , formed the acropolis of Troy . The Palladium was set up on its banks near its source , in a temple especially erected for it ( l. 6 ) , and from this lofty position was supposed to watch over the safety of the city and her defenders on the plains below .</p>
   <p>= 3 . Hector .= Hector , son of Priam , king of Troy ( Ilium ) , and his wife , Hecuba , was the leader and champion of the Trojan armies . He distinguished himself in numerous single combats with the ablest of the Greek heroes ; and to him was principally due the stubborn defence of the Trojan capital . He was finally slain by Achilles , aided by Athene , and his body dragged thrice around the walls of Troy behind the chariot of his conqueror .</p>
   <p>= 14 . Xanthus .= The Scamander , the largest and most celebrated river of the Troad , near which Troy was situated , was presided over by a deity known to the gods as Xanthus . His contest with Achilles , whom he so nearly overwhelmed , forms a notable incident of the Iliad .</p>
   <p>= 15 . Ajax , or Aiax .= One of the leading Greek heroes in the siege of Troy , famous for his size , physical strength , and beauty . In bravery and feats of valor he was second only to Achilles . Not being awarded the armor of Achilles after that hero 's death , he slew himself .<span type="note_anchor">[ 190 ]</span>= 16 .= Helen , the wife of Menelaus , king of Sparta , was celebrated for her beauty , by reason of which frequent references are made to her by both classic and modern writers . Goethe introduces her in the second part of Faust , and Faustus , in Marlowe 's play of that name , addresses her thus :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Oh ! thou art fairer than the evening air</l>
     <l n="2">Clad in the beauty of a thousand stars . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Her abduction by Paris , son of Priam ( see note , l. 3 ) , was the cause of the Trojan war , the most notable incident of Greek mythology , which forms the theme of Homer 's greatest poem , the Iliad .</p>

   <p>APRIL , 1850</p>
   <p>Wordsworth died at Rydal Mount , in the Lake , District , April 23 , 1850 . These verses , dedicated to his memory , are among Arnold 's best-known lines . For adequacy of meaning and charm of expression , they are almost unsurpassed ; they also contain some of the poet 's soundest poetical criticism . The poem was first published in Fraser 's Magazine for June , 1850 , and bore the date of April 27 .</p>
   <p>= 1 . Goethe in Weimar sleeps .= The tomb of Goethe , the celebrated German author ( see note , l. 29 , Epilogue to Lessing 's Laocoön ) , is in Weimar , the capital of the Grand-duchy of Saxe-Weimar . Weimar is noted as the literary centre of Germany , and for this reason is styled the German Athens .</p>
   <p>= 2 . Byron .= George Gordon Byron ( 1788-1824 ) , a celebrated English poet of the French Revolutionary period , died at Missolonghi , Greece , where he had gone to help the Greeks in their struggle to throw off the Turkish yoke . He was preëminently a poet of passion , and , as such , exerted a marked influence on the literature of his day . His petulant , bitter rebellion against all law has become proverbial ; hence the term “ Byronic . ” The = Titans = ( l. 14 ) were a race of giants who warred against the gods . The aptness of the comparison made here is at once evident . In Arnold 's sonnet , A Picture at Newstead , also occur these lines :—</p>
   <lg>

Thither Orpheus descended , and , by the charm of his lyre and song , persuaded Pluto to restore her to life . This he consented to do on condition that she walk behind her husband , who was not to look at her until they had arrived in the upper world . Orpheus , however , looked back , thus violating the conditions , and Eurydice was caught back into the infernal regions .</p>

    <head>THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY</head>
    <head>“ There was very lately a lad in the University of Oxford who was by his poverty forced to leave his studies there and at last to join himself to a company of vagabond gipsies . Among these extravagant people , by the insinuating subtilty of his carriage , he quickly got so much of their love and esteem that they discovered to him their mystery . After he had been a pretty while exercised in the trade , there chanced to ride by a couple of scholars who had formerly been of his acquaintance . They quickly spied out their old friend among the gipsies , and he gave them an account of the necessity which drove him to that kind of life , and told them that the people he went with were not such impostors as they were taken for , but that they had a traditional kind of learning among them , and could do wonders by the power of imagination , their fancy binding that of others ; that himself had learned much of their art , and when he had compassed the whole secret , he intended , he said , to leave their company , and give the world an account of what he had learned . ” — GLANVIL 'S Vanity of Dogmatizing , 1661 .<span type="note_anchor">[ 198 ]</span></head>

Nothing could illustrate better than this [ closing ] passage Arnold 's genius and his art .... His whole drift having been that care and effort and gain and pressure of the world are sapping human strength , he ends with a picture of the old-world pride and daring , which exhibits human strength in its freshness and vigor .... I could quote poem after poem which Arnold closes by some such buoyant digression : a buoyant digression intended to shake off the tone of melancholy , and to remind us that the world of imaginative life is still wide open to us .... This problem is insoluble , he seems to say , but insoluble or not , let us recall the pristine force of the human spirit , and not forget that we have access to great resources still ....

    <head>THYRSIS</head>
     <l n="1">A monody to commemorate the author 's friend , Arthur Hugh Clough , who</l>
     <l n="2">died at Florence , 1861 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Throughout this poem there is reference to the preceding selection , The Scholar-Gipsy , of which it is the companion piece , and , in a sense , the sequel . It is one of the four great elegies in the English language .</p>
   <p>Thyrsis is a name common to both ancient and modern literature . In the Idyls of Theocritus it is used as the name of a herdsman ; in the Eclogues of Vergil , of a shepherd ; while in later writings it has come to mean any rustic .</p>
   <p>Arthur Hugh Clough ( 1819-1861 ) , whose poetry is closely akin in spirit to Arnold 's , was a young man of genius and promise . He studied at both Rugby and Oxford , where he and Arnold were intimately associated and became fast friends . In 1869 his health began to fail , and two years later he died in Florence , Italy , where he had gone in the hope of being benefited by the climate .</p>
   <p>Arnold , in a letter to his mother dated April , 1866 , says of his poem : “ Tell dear old Edward [ Arnold ] that the diction of the Thyrsis was modelled on that of Theocritus , whom I have been much reading during the two years this poem has been forming itself , and that I meant the diction to be so artless as to be almost heedless . However , there is a mean which must not be passed , and before I reprint this I will consider well all objections . The images are all from actual observation .... The cuckoo in the wet June morning , I heard in the garden at Woodford , and all those three stanzas , which you like , are reminiscences of Woodford . Edward has , I think , fixed on the two stanzas I myself like best : ‘ O easy access , ’ and ‘ And long the way appears . ’ I also like ‘ Where is the girl , ’ and the stanza before it ; but that is because they bring certain places and moments before me .... It is probably too quiet a poem for the general taste , but I think it will stand wear . ” To his friend , John Campbell Shairp , Arnold wrote , a few days later : “ Thyrsis is a very quiet poem , but , I think , solid and sincere . It will not be popular , however . It had long been in my head to connect Clough with that Cumner country , and , when I began , I was carried irresistibly into this form . You say , truly , that there was much in Clough ( the whole prophetic side , in fact ) which one cannot deal with in this way .... Still , Clough had the idyllic side , too ; to deal with this suited my desire to deal again with that Cumner country . Anyway , only so could I treat the matter this time .

And that sweet city with her dreaming spires .= Arnold 's intense love for Oxford and the surrounding country appears in many of his essays and poems . In the introduction to his Essays on Criticism , Vol . I , occurs the following tribute : “ Beautiful city ! so venerable , so lovely , so unravaged by the fierce intellectual life of our century , so serene !</p>
   <p>‘ There are our young barbarians all at play ! ’</p>
   <p>And yet , steeped in sentiment as she lies , spreading her garments to the moonlight , and whispering from her towers the last enchantment of the Middle Age , who will deny that Oxford , by her ineffable charm , keeps ever calling us nearer the true goal of all of us , to the ideal , to perfection — to beauty , in a word , which is only truth seen from another side ?... Home of lost causes and forsaken beliefs and unpopular names and impossible loyalties ! what example could ever so inspire us to keep down the Philistine in ourselves , what teacher could ever so save us from that bondage to which we are all prone , that bondage which Goethe , in his incomparable lines on the death of Schiller , makes it his friend 's highest praise ... to have left miles out of sight behind him : the bondage of ‘ was uns alle bändigt , Das Gemeine ’ ? ”</p>

   <p>= 181-190 =. Daphnis , the ideal Sicilian shepherd of Greek pastoral poetry , was said to have followed into Phrygia his mistress Piplea , who had been carried off by robbers , and to have found her in the power of the king of Phrygia , Lityerses . Lityerses used to make strangers try a contest with him in reaping corn , and to put them to death if he overcame them . Hercules arrived in time to save Daphnis , took upon himself the reaping contest with Lityerses , overcame him , and slew him . The Lityerses-song connected with this tradition was , like the Linus-song , one of the early , plaintive strains of Greek popular poetry , and used to be sung by the corn reapers . Other traditions represented Daphnis as beloved by a nymph , who exacted from him an oath to love no one else . He fell in love with a princess , and was struck blind by the jealous nymph . Mercury , who was his father , raised him to heaven , and made a fountain spring up in the place from which he ascended . At this fountain the Sicilians offered yearly sacrifices .

   <p>RUGBY CHAPEL</p>
   <p>Rugby Chapel ( 1857 ) , one of Arnold 's best-known and most characteristic productions , was written in memory of his father , Dr. Thomas Arnold , famous as the great head-master at Rugby . Dr. Arnold was born at East Cowes in the Isle of Wight , June 13 , 1795 , and as a boy was at school at Warminster and Winchester . In 1811 he entered Corpus Christi College , Oxford , and having won recognition as a scholar , was awarded a fellowship of the Oriel in 1815 . Three years later he settled at Laleham , where , in 1820 , he married Mary Penrose , daughter of Justice Penrose , and where , two years later , was born Matthew , who was destined to win marked distinction among English men of letters . In 1827 he was elected head-master at Rugby , and shortly afterward began those important reforms which have placed him among the greatest educators of his century . Chief among his writings is his History of Rome , published in several volumes . In 1841 he was appointed Regius Professor of History at Oxford . He died very suddenly on Sunday , June 12 , 1842 , and on the following Friday his remains were interred in the chancel of Rugby Chapel , immediately under the communion table .<span type="note_anchor">[ 210 ]</span></p>
   <p>In his poem Arnold has drawn a vivid picture of a strong , helpful , hopeful , unselfish soul , cheering and supporting his weaker comrades in their upward and onward march — a picture of the guide and companion of his earlier years ; and in so doing he has preserved his father 's memory to posterity in a striking and an abiding way .</p>
   <p>= 1-13 =. Note carefully the tone of these introductory lines , and determine the poet 's purpose in opening the poem in this mood . The picture inevitably calls to mind Bryant 's lines , The Death of Flowers .</p>
   <p>= 16 . gloom =. The key-word to the preceding lines . Explain why it calls to mind the poet 's father . Keats makes a similar use of the word forlorn in his Ode to the Nightingale .</p>
   <p>“ ... forlorn . Forlorn ! the very word is like a bell To toll me back from thee to my sole self . ”</p>
   <p>= 30-33 =. Discuss the figure as to its aptness .</p>
   <p>= 37 . shore =. A word common to hymns .</p>
   <p>= 38-57 =. Discuss the poet 's idea of the future life as set forth in these lines . Can you think of any other author or authors who have held a like view ?</p>
   <p>= 58-59 =. The poet asks this question only to answer it in the lines following . Compare and contrast the two classes of men spoken of ; their aims in life and their achievements . Why is the path of those who have chosen a “ clear-purposed goal ” pictured so difficult ? Who are they that start well , but fall out by the wayside ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 211 ]</span></p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>= 98-101 =. So unstable is the hold of the “ snow-beds ” on the mountain sides that travellers passing beneath them are forbidden by the guides to speak , lest their voices precipitate an avalanche . See ll . 160-169 , Sohrab and Rustum .</p>
   <p>= 117-123 =. What human frailties are indicated in the answer to the host 's question ? Note the contrast in the succeeding lines .</p>
   <p>= 124-144 =. The imagery of these lines is drawn from Dr. Arnold 's life at Rugby . Under his care frequent excursions were made into the neighboring Westmoreland Hills . Nothing perhaps gives a better idea of the man than the description of his “ delight in those long mountain walks , when they would start with their provisions for the day , himself the guide and life of the party , always on the lookout how best to break the ascent by gentle stages , comforting the little ones in their falls and helping forward those who were tired , himself always keeping with the laggers , that none might strain their strength by trying to be in front with him ; and then , when his assistance was not wanted , the liveliest of all — his step so light , his eye so quick in finding flowers to take home to those who were not of the party . ” — ARTHUR PENRHYN STANLEY .</p>
