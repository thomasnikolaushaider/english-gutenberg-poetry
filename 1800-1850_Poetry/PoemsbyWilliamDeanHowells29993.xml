    <head>THE PILOT 'S STORY .</head>
    <lg type="part" n="1">
     <head>I .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="1">
      <l n="1">It was a story the pilot told , with his back to his hearers ,—</l>
      <l n="2">Keeping his hand on the wheel and his eye on the globe of the</l>
      <l n="3">jack-staff ,</l>
      <l n="4">Holding the boat to the shore and out of the sweep of the current ,</l>
      <l n="5">Lightly turning aside for the heavy logs of the drift-wood ,</l>
      <l n="6">Widely shunning the snags that made us sardonic obeisance .</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
    <lg type="part" n="2">
     <head>II .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="7">All the soft , damp air was full of delicate perfume</l>
      <l n="8">From the young willows in bloom on either bank of the river ,—</l>
      <l n="9">Faint , delicious fragrance , trancing the indolent senses</l>
      <l n="10">In a luxurious dream of the river and land of the lotus .</l>
      <l n="11">Not yet out of the west the roses of sunset were withered ;</l>
      <l n="12">In the deep blue above light clouds of gold and of crimson</l>
      <l n="13">Floated in slumber serene ; and the restless river beneath them</l>
      <l n="14">Rushed away to the sea with a vision of rest in its bosom ;</l>
      <l n="15">Far on the eastern shore lay dimly the swamps of the cypress ;</l>
      <l n="16">Dimly before us the islands grew from the river 's expanses ,—</l>
      <l n="17">Beautiful , wood-grown isles , with the gleam of the swart inundation</l>
      <l n="18">Seen through the swaying boughs and slender trunks of their</l>
      <l n="19">willows ;</l>
      <l n="20">And on the shore beside us the cotton-trees rose in the evening ,</l>
      <l n="21">Phantom-like , yearningly , wearily , with the inscrutable sadness</l>
      <l n="22">Of the mute races of trees . While hoarsely the steam from her</l>
      <l n="23">‘ scape-pipes</l>
      <l n="24">Shouted , then whispered a moment , then shouted again to the</l>
      <l n="25">silence ,</l>
      <l n="26">Trembling through all her frame with the mighty pulse of her</l>
      <l n="27">engines ,</l>
      <l n="28">Slowly the boat ascended the swollen and broad Mississippi ,</l>
      <l n="29">Bank-full , sweeping on , with tangled masses of drift-wood ,</l>
      <l n="30">Daintily breathed about with whiffs of silvery vapor ,</l>
      <l n="31">Where in his arrowy flight the twittering swallow alighted ,</l>
      <l n="32">And the belated blackbird paused on the way to its nestlings .</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
    <lg type="part" n="3">
     <head>III .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="33">It was the pilot 's story :— “ They both came aboard there , at Cairo ,</l>
      <l n="34">From a New Orleans boat , and took passage with us for Saint Louis .</l>
      <l n="35">She was a beautiful woman , with just enough blood from her mother</l>
      <l n="36">Darkening her eyes and her hair to make her race known to a trader :</l>
      <l n="37">You would have thought she was white . The man that was with</l>
      <l n="38">her ,— you see such ,—</l>
      <l n="39">Weakly good-natured and kind , and weakly good-natured and vicious ,</l>
      <l n="40">Slender of body and soul , fit neither for loving nor hating .</l>
      <l n="41">I was a youngster then , and only learning the river ,—</l>
      <l n="42">Not over-fond of the wheel . I used to watch them at monte ,</l>
      <l n="43">Down in the cabin at night , and learned to know all of the</l>
      <l n="44">gamblers .</l>
      <l n="45">So when I saw this weak one staking his money against them ,</l>
      <l n="46">Betting upon the turn of the cards , I knew what was coming :</l>
      <l n="47">They never left their pigeons a single feather to fly with .</l>
      <l n="48">Next day I saw them together ,— the stranger and one of the</l>
      <l n="49">gamblers :</l>
      <l n="50">Picturesque rascal he was , with long black hair and moustaches ,</l>
      <l n="51">Black slouch hat drawn down to his eyes from his villanous</l>
      <l n="52">forehead .</l>
      <l n="53">On together they moved , still earnestly talking in whispers ,</l>
      <l n="54">On toward the forecastle , where sat the woman alone by the gangway .</l>
      <l n="55">Roused by the fall of feet , she turned , and , beholding her master ,</l>
      <l n="56">Greeted him with a smile that was more like a wife 's than</l>
      <l n="57">another 's ,</l>
      <l n="58">Rose to meet him fondly , and then , with the dread apprehension</l>
      <l n="59">Always haunting the slave , fell her eye on the face of the</l>
      <l n="60">gambler ,—</l>
      <l n="61">Dark and lustful and fierce and full of merciless cunning .</l>
      <l n="62">Something was spoken so low that I could not hear what the words</l>
      <l n="63">were ;</l>
      <l n="64">Only the woman started , and looked from one to the other ,</l>
      <l n="65">With imploring eyes , bewildered hands , and a tremor</l>
      <l n="66">All through her frame : I saw her from where I was standing , she</l>
      <l n="67">shook so .</l>
      <l n="68">‘ Say ! is it so ? ’ she cried . On the weak , white lips of her master</l>
      <l n="69">Died a sickly smile , and he said , ‘ Louise , I have sold you . ’</l>
      <l n="70">God is my judge ! May I never see such a look of despairing ,</l>
      <l n="71">Desolate anguish , as that which the woman cast on her master ,</l>
      <l n="72">Griping her breast with her little hands , as if he had stabbed her ,</l>
      <l n="73">Standing in silence a space , as fixed as the Indian woman</l>
      <l n="74">Carved out of wood , on the pilot-house of the old Pocahontas !</l>
      <l n="75">Then , with a gurgling moan , like the sound in the throat of the</l>
      <l n="76">dying ,</l>
      <l n="77">Came back her voice , that , rising , fluttered , through wild</l>
      <l n="78">incoherence ,</l>
      <l n="79">Into a terrible shriek that stopped my heart while she answered :—</l>
      <l n="80">‘ Sold me ? sold me ? sold — And you promised to give me my freedom !—</l>
      <l n="81">Promised me , for the sake of our little boy in Saint Louis !</l>
      <l n="82">What will you say to our boy , when he cries for me there in Saint</l>
      <l n="83">Louis ?</l>
      <l n="84">What will you say to our God ?— Ah , you have been joking ! I see</l>
      <l n="85">it !—</l>
      <l n="86">No ? God ! God ! He shall hear it ,— and all of the angels in heaven ,—</l>
      <l n="87">Even the devils in hell !— and none will believe when they hear it !</l>
      <l n="88">Sold me ! ’ — Her voice died away with a wail , and in silence</l>
      <l n="89">Down she sank on the deck , and covered her face with her fingers . ”</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
    <lg type="part" n="4">
     <head>IV .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="90">In his story a moment the pilot paused , while we listened</l>
      <l n="91">To the salute of a boat , that , rounding the point of an island ,</l>
      <l n="92">Flamed toward us with fires that seemed to burn from the waters ,—</l>
      <l n="93">Stately and vast and swift , and borne on the heart of the current .</l>
      <l n="94">Then , with the mighty voice of a giant challenged to battle ,</l>
      <l n="95">Rose the responsive whistle , and all the echoes of island ,</l>
      <l n="96">Swamp-land , glade , and brake replied with a myriad clamor ,</l>
      <l n="97">Like wild birds that are suddenly startled from slumber at</l>
      <l n="98">midnight ,</l>
      <l n="99">Then were at peace once more ; and we heard the harsh cries of the</l>
      <l n="100">peacocks</l>
      <l n="101">Perched on a tree by a cabin-door , where the white-headed settler 's</l>
      <l n="102">White-headed children stood to look at the boat as it passed them ,</l>
      <l n="103">Passed them so near that we heard their happy talk and their</l>
      <l n="104">laughter .</l>
      <l n="105">Softly the sunset had faded , and now on the eastern horizon</l>
      <l n="106">Hung , like a tear in the sky , the beautiful star of the evening .</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
    <lg type="part" n="5">
     <head>V .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="107">Still with his back to us standing , the pilot went on with his</l>
      <l n="108">story :—</l>
      <l n="109">“ All of us flocked round the woman . The children cried , and their</l>
      <l n="110">mothers</l>
      <l n="111">Hugged them tight to their breasts ; but the gambler said to the</l>
      <l n="112">captain ,—</l>
      <l n="113">‘ Put me off there at the town that lies round the bend of the</l>
      <l n="114">river .</l>
      <l n="115">Here , you ! rise at once , and be ready now to go with me . ’</l>
      <l n="116">Roughly he seized the woman 's arm and strove to uplift her .</l>
      <l n="117">She — she seemed not to heed him , but rose like one that is</l>
      <l n="118">dreaming ,</l>
      <l n="119">Slid from his grasp , and fleetly mounted the steps of the gangway ,</l>
      <l n="120">Up to the hurricane-deck , in silence , without lamentation .</l>
      <l n="121">Straight to the stern of the boat , where the wheel was , she ran , and</l>
      <l n="122">the people</l>
      <l n="123">Followed her fast till she turned and stood at bay for a moment ,</l>
      <l n="124">Looking them in the face , and in the face of the gambler .</l>
      <l n="125">Not one to save her ,— not one of all the compassionate people !</l>
      <l n="126">Not one to save her , of all the pitying angels in heaven !</l>
      <l n="127">Not one bolt of God to strike him dead there before her !</l>
      <l n="128">Wildly she waved him back , we waiting in silence and horror .</l>
      <l n="129">Over the swarthy face of the gambler a pallor of passion</l>
      <l n="130">Passed , like a gleam of lightning over the west in the night-time .</l>
      <l n="131">White , she stood , and mute , till he put forth his hand to secure</l>
      <l n="132">her ;</l>
      <l n="133">Then she turned and leaped ,— in mid-air fluttered a moment ,—</l>
      <l n="134">Down then , whirling , fell , like a broken-winged bird from a</l>
      <l n="135">tree-top ,</l>
      <l n="136">Down on the cruel wheel , that caught her , and hurled her , and</l>
      <l n="137">crushed her ,</l>
      <l n="138">And in the foaming water plunged her , and hid her forever . ”</l>

     <head>VI .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="6">
      <l n="139">Still with his back to us all the pilot stood , but we heard him</l>
      <l n="140">Swallowing hard , as he pulled the bell-rope for stopping . Then ,</l>
      <l n="141">turning ,—</l>
      <l n="142">“ This is the place where it happened , ” brokenly whispered the</l>
      <l n="143">pilot .</l>
      <l n="144">“ Somehow , I never like to go by here alone in the night-time . ”</l>
      <l n="145">Darkly the Mississippi flowed by the town that lay in the</l>
      <l n="146">starlight ,</l>
      <l n="147">Cheerful with lamps . Below we could hear them reversing the</l>
      <l n="148">engines ,</l>
      <l n="149">And the great boat glided up to the shore like a giant exhausted .</l>
      <l n="150">Heavily sighed her pipes . Broad over the swamps to the eastward</l>
      <l n="151">Shone the full moon , and turned our far-trembling wake into silver .</l>
      <l n="152">All was serene and calm , but the odorous breath of the willows</l>
      <l n="153">Smote with a mystical sense of infinite sorrow upon us .</l>

    <head>LOUIS LEBEAU 'S CONVERSION .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Yesterday , while I moved with the languid crowd on the Riva ,</l>
     <l n="2">Musing with idle eyes on the wide lagoons and the islands ,</l>
     <l n="3">And on the dim-seen seaward glimmering sails in the distance ,</l>
     <l n="4">Where the azure haze , like a vision of Indian-Summer ,</l>
     <l n="5">Haunted the dreamy sky of the soft Venetian December ,—</l>
     <l n="6">While I moved unwilled in the mellow warmth of the weather ,</l>
     <l n="7">Breathing air that was full of Old World sadness and beauty</l>
     <l n="8">Into my thought came this story of free , wild life in Ohio ,</l>
     <l n="9">When the land was new , and yet by the Beautiful River</l>
     <l n="10">Dwelt the pioneers and Indian hunters and boatmen .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">Pealed from the campanili , responding from island to island ,</l>
     <l n="12">Bells of that ancient faith whose incense and solemn devotions</l>
     <l n="13">Rise from a hundred shrines in the broken heart of the city ;</l>
     <l n="14">But in my revery heard I only the passionate voices</l>
     <l n="15">Of the people that sang in the virgin heart of the forest .</l>
     <l n="16">Autumn was in the land , and the trees were golden and crimson ,</l>
     <l n="17">And from the luminous boughs of the over-elms and the maples</l>
     <l n="18">Tender and beautiful fell the light in the worshippers ’ faces ,</l>
     <l n="19">Softer than lights that stream through the saints on the windows of</l>
     <l n="20">churches ,</l>
     <l n="21">While the balsamy breath of the hemlocks and pines by the river</l>
     <l n="22">Stole on the winds through the woodland aisles like the breath of a</l>
     <l n="23">censer .</l>
     <l n="24">Loud the people sang old camp-meeting anthems that quaver</l>
     <l n="25">Quaintly yet from lips forgetful of lips that have kissed them ;</l>
     <l n="26">Loud they sang the songs of the Sacrifice and Atonement ,</l>
     <l n="27">And of the end of the world , and the infinite terrors of Judgment :—</l>
     <l n="28">Songs of ineffable sorrow , and wailing , compassionate warning</l>
     <l n="29">Unto the generations that hardened their hearts to their Savior ;</l>
     <l n="30">Songs of exultant rapture for them that confessed him and followed ,</l>
     <l n="31">Bearing his burden and yoke , enduring and entering with him</l>
     <l n="32">Into the rest of his saints , and the endless reward of the blessed .</l>
     <l n="33">Loud the people sang ; but through the sound of their singing</l>
     <l n="34">Broke inarticulate cries and moans and sobs from the mourners ,</l>
     <l n="35">As the glory of God , that smote the apostle of Tarsus ,</l>
     <l n="36">Smote them and strewed them to earth like leaves in the breath of</l>
     <l n="37">the whirlwind .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="38">Hushed at last was the sound of the lamentation and singing ;</l>
     <l n="39">But from the distant hill the throbbing drum of the pheasant</l>
     <l n="40">Shook with its heavy pulses the depths of the listening silence ,</l>
     <l n="41">When from his place arose a white-haired exhorter , and faltered :</l>
     <l n="42">“ Brethren and sisters in Jesus ! the Lord hath heard our petitions ,</l>
     <l n="43">So that the hearts of his servants are awed and melted within</l>
     <l n="44">them ,—</l>
     <l n="45">Even the hearts of the wicked are touched by his infinite mercy .</l>
     <l n="46">All my days in this vale of tears the Lord hath been with me ,</l>
     <l n="47">He hath been good to me , he hath granted me trials and patience ;</l>
     <l n="48">But this hour hath crowned my knowledge of him and his goodness .</l>
     <l n="49">Truly , but that it is well this day for me to be with you ,</l>
     <l n="50">Now might I say to the Lord ,— ‘ I know thee , my God , in all fulness ;</l>
     <l n="51">Now let thy servant depart in peace to the rest thou hast</l>
     <l n="52">promised ! ’ ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="53">Faltered and ceased . And now the wild and jubilant music</l>
     <l n="54">Of the singing burst from the solemn profound of the silence ,</l>
     <l n="55">Surged in triumph , and fell , and ebbed again into silence .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="56">Then from the group of the preachers arose the greatest among</l>
     <l n="57">them ,—</l>
     <l n="58">He whose days were given in youth to the praise of the Savior ,</l>
     <l n="59">He whose lips seemed touched , like the prophet 's of old , from the</l>
     <l n="60">altar ,</l>
     <l n="61">So that his words were flame , and burned to the hearts of his</l>
     <l n="62">hearers ,</l>
     <l n="63">Quickening the dead among them , reviving the cold and the doubting .</l>
     <l n="64">There he charged them pray , and rest not from prayer while a sinner</l>
     <l n="65">In the sound of their voices denied the Friend of the sinner :</l>
     <l n="66">“ Pray till the night shall fall ,— till the stars are faint in the</l>
     <l n="67">morning ,—</l>
     <l n="68">Yea , till the sun himself be faint in that glory and brightness ,</l>
     <l n="69">Faint in the light which shall dawn in mercy for penitent sinners . ”</l>
     <l n="70">Kneeling , he led them in prayer ; and the quick and sobbing</l>
     <l n="71">responses</l>
     <l n="72">Spake how their souls were moved with the might and the grace of the</l>
     <l n="73">Spirit .</l>
     <l n="74">Then while the converts recounted how God had chastened and saved</l>
     <l n="75">them ,—</l>
     <l n="76">Children , whose golden locks yet shone with the lingering</l>
     <l n="77">effulgence</l>
     <l n="78">Of the touches of Him who blessed little children forever ;</l>
     <l n="79">Old men , whose yearning eyes were dimmed with the far-streaming</l>
     <l n="80">brightness</l>
     <l n="81">Seen through the opening gates in the heart of the heavenly city ,—</l>
     <l n="82">Stealthily through the harking woods the lengthening shadows</l>
     <l n="83">Chased the wild things to their nests , and the twilight died into</l>
     <l n="84">darkness .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="85">Now the four great pyres that were placed there to light the</l>
     <l n="86">encampment ,</l>
     <l n="87">High on platforms raised above the people , were kindled .</l>
     <l n="88">Flaming aloof , as it were the pillar by night in the Desert</l>
     <l n="89">Fell their crimson light on the lifted orbs of the preachers ,</l>
     <l n="90">Fell on the withered brows of the old men , and Israel 's mothers ,</l>
     <l n="91">Fell on the bloom of youth , and the earnest devotion of manhood ,</l>
     <l n="92">Fell on the anguish and hope in the tearful eyes of the mourners .</l>
     <l n="93">Flaming aloof , it stirred the sleep of the luminous maples</l>
     <l n="94">With warm summer-dreams , and faint , luxurious languor .</l>
     <l n="95">Near the four great pyres the people closed in a circle ,</l>

     <l n="97">And on the skirts of the circle the unrepentant and scorners ,—</l>

     <l n="105">Heir to Old World want and New World love of adventure .</l>
     <l n="106">Vague was the life he led , and vague and grotesque were the rumors</l>

     <l n="208">Not with the rest was lifted her voice in the fervent responses ,</l>

     <l n="220">Glorified she rose , and stood in the midst of the people ,</l>
     <l n="221">Looking on all with the still , unseeing eyes of devotion ,—</l>
     <l n="222">Vague , and tender , and sweet , as the eyes of the dead , when we dream</l>
     <l n="223">them</l>
     <l n="224">Living and looking on us , but they cannot speak , and we cannot ,—</l>

     <l n="226">Knowing only the fear and error and wrong that withheld him ,</l>
     <l n="227">Thinking , “ In doubt of me , his soul had perished forever ! ”</l>
     <l n="228">Touched with no feeble shame , but trusting her power to save him ,</l>

     <l n="234">Drew him then with her , and passed once more through the circle</l>
     <l n="235">Unto her place , and knelt with him there by the side of her father ,</l>
     <l n="236">Trembling as women tremble who greatly venture and triumph ,—</l>

     <l n="243">Not the less now discerned was her inspiration from heaven</l>
     <l n="244">By the people , that rose , and embracing and weeping together ,</l>
     <l n="245">Poured forth their jubilant songs of victory and of thanksgiving ,</l>
     <l n="246">Till from the embers leaped the dying flame to behold them ,</l>
     <l n="247">And the hills of the river were filled with reverberant echoes ,—</l>
     <l n="248">Echoes that out of the years and the distance stole to me hither ,</l>
     <l n="249">While I moved unwilled in the mellow warmth of the weather ;</l>
     <l n="250">Echoes that mingled and fainted and fell with the fluttering</l>

The hero of the story , Federigo , became the third Marquis of Mantua , and was a prince greatly beloved and honored by his subjects .</head>

     <lg type="stanza" n="1">
      <l n="1">That time of year , you know , when the summer , beginning to sadden ,</l>
      <l n="2">Full-mooned and silver-misted , glides from the heart of September ,</l>
      <l n="3">Mourned by disconsolate crickets , and iterant grasshoppers , crying</l>
      <l n="4">All the still nights long , from the ripened abundance of gardens ;</l>
      <l n="5">Then , ere the boughs of the maples are mantled with earliest</l>
      <l n="6">autumn ,</l>
      <l n="7">But the wind of autumn breathes from the orchards at nightfall ,</l>
      <l n="8">Full of winy perfume and mystical yearning and languor ;</l>
      <l n="9">And in the noonday woods you hear the foraging squirrels ,</l>
      <l n="10">And the long , crashing fall of the half-eaten nut from the</l>
      <l n="11">tree-top ;</l>
      <l n="12">When the robins are mute , and the yellow-birds , haunting the</l>
      <l n="13">thistles ,</l>
      <l n="14">Cheep , and twitter , and flit through the dusty lanes and the</l>
      <l n="15">loppings ,</l>
      <l n="16">When the pheasant booms from your stealthy foot in the cornfield ,</l>
      <l n="17">And the wild-pigeons feed , few and shy , in the scoke-berry bushes ;</l>
      <l n="18">When the weary land lies hushed , like a seer in a vision ,</l>
      <l n="19">And your life seems but the dream of a dream which you cannot</l>
      <l n="20">remember ,—</l>
      <l n="21">Broken , bewildering , vague , an echo that answers to nothing !</l>
      <l n="22">That time of year , you know . They stood by the gate in the meadow ,</l>
      <l n="23">Fronting the sinking sun , and the level stream of its splendor</l>
      <l n="24">Crimsoned the meadow-slope and woodland with tenderest sunset ,</l>
      <l n="25">Made her beautiful face like the luminous face of an angel ,</l>
      <l n="26">Smote through the painéd gloom of his heart like a hurt to the</l>
      <l n="27">sense , there .</l>
      <l n="28">Languidly clung about by the half-fallen shawl , and with folded</l>
      <l n="29">Hands , that held a few sad asters : “ I sigh for this idyl</l>
      <l n="30">Lived at last to an end ; and , looking on to my prose-life , ”</l>
      <l n="31">With a smile , she said , and a subtle derision of manner ,</l>
      <l n="32">“ Better and better I seem , when I recollect all that has happened</l>
      <l n="33">Since I came here in June : the walks we have taken together</l>
      <l n="34">Through these darling meadows , and dear , old , desolate woodlands ;</l>
      <l n="35">All our afternoon readings , and all our strolls through the moonlit</l>
      <l n="36">Village ,— so sweetly asleep , one scarcely could credit the scandal ,</l>
      <l n="37">Heartache , and trouble , and spite , that were hushed for the night ,</l>
      <l n="38">in its silence .</l>
      <l n="39">Yes , I am better . I think I could even be civil to him for his</l>
      <l n="40">kindness ,</l>
      <l n="41">Letting me come here without him .... But open the gate , Cousin</l>
      <l n="42">Clement ;</l>
      <l n="43">Seems to me it grows chill , and I think it is healthier in-doors .</l>
      <l n="44">— No , then I you need not speak , for I know well enough what is</l>
      <l n="45">coming :</l>
      <l n="46">Bitter taunts for the past , and discouraging views of the future ?</l>
      <l n="47">Tragedy , Cousin Clement , or comedy ,— just as you like it ;—</l>
      <l n="48">Only not here alone , but somewhere that people can see you .</l>
      <l n="49">Then I 'll take part in the play , and appear the remorseful young</l>
      <l n="50">person</l>
      <l n="51">Full of divine regrets at not having smothered a genius</l>
      <l n="52">Under the feathers and silks of a foolish , extravagant woman .</l>
      <l n="53">O you selfish boy ! what was it , just now , about anguish ?</l>
      <l n="54">Bills would be your talk , Cousin Clement , if you were my husband . ”</l>
      <l n="55">Then , with her summer-night glory of eyes low-bending upon him ,</l>
      <l n="56">Dark'ning his thoughts as the pondered stars bewilder and darken ,</l>
      <l n="57">Tenderly , wistfully drooping toward him , she faltered in whisper ,—</l>
      <l n="58">All her mocking face transfigured ,— with mournful effusion :</l>
      <l n="59">“ Clement , do not think it is you alone that remember ,—</l>
      <l n="60">Do not think it is you alone that have suffered . Ambition ,</l>
      <l n="61">Fame , and your art ,— you have all these things to console you .</l>
      <l n="62">I — what have I in this world ? Since my child is dead — a bereavement . ”</l>
      <l n="63">Sad hung her eyes on his , and he felt all the anger within him</l>
      <l n="64">Broken , and melting in tears . But he shrank from her touch while he</l>
      <l n="65">answered</l>
      <l n="66">( Awkwardly , being a man , and awkwardly , being a lover ) ,</l>
      <l n="67">“ Yes , you know how it is done . You have cleverly fooled me</l>
      <l n="68">beforetime ,</l>
      <l n="69">With a dainty scorn , and then an imploring forgiveness !</l>
      <l n="70">Yes , you might play it , I think ,— that rôle of remorseful young</l>
      <l n="71">person ,</l>
      <l n="72">That , or the old man 's darling , or anything else you attempted .</l>
      <l n="73">Even your earnest is so much like acting I fear a betrayal ,</l>
      <l n="74">Trusting your speech . You say that you have not forgotten . I grant</l>
      <l n="75">you —</l>
      <l n="76">Not , indeed , for your word — that is light — but I wish to believe</l>
      <l n="77">you .</l>
      <l n="78">Well , I say , since you have not forgotten , forget now , forever !</l>
      <l n="79">I — I have lived and loved , and you have lived and have married .</l>
      <l n="80">Only receive this bud to remember me when we have parted ,—</l>
      <l n="81">Thorns and splendor , no sweetness , rose of the love that I</l>
      <l n="82">cherished ! ”</l>
      <l n="83">There he tore from its stalk the imperial flower of the thistle ,</l>
      <l n="84">Tore , and gave to her , who took it with mocking obeisance ,</l>
      <l n="85">Twined it in her hair , and said , with her subtle derision :</l>
      <l n="86">“ You are a wiser man than I thought you could ever be , Clement ,—</l>
      <l n="87">Sensible , almost . So ! I 'll try to forget and remember . ”</l>
      <l n="88">Lightly she took his arm , but on through the lane to the farm-house ,</l>
      <l n="89">Mutely together they moved through the lonesome , odorous twilight .</l>
     </lg>

    <lg type="part" n="2">
     <head>II .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="90">High on the farm-house hearth , the first autumn fire was kindled ;</l>
      <l n="91">Scintillant hickory bark and dryest limbs of the beech-tree</l>
      <l n="92">Burned , where all summer long the boughs of asparagus flourished .</l>
      <l n="93">Wild were the children with mirth , and grouping and clinging</l>
      <l n="94">together ,</l>
      <l n="95">Danced with the dancing flame , and lithely swayed with its humor ;</l>
      <l n="96">Ran to the window-panes , and peering forth into the darkness ,</l>
      <l n="97">Saw there another room , flame-lit , and with frolicking children .</l>
      <l n="98">( Ah ! by such phantom hearths , I think that we sit with our</l>
      <l n="99">first-loves ! )</l>
      <l n="100">Sometimes they tossed on the floor , and sometimes they hid in the</l>
      <l n="101">corners ,</l>
      <l n="102">Shouting and laughing aloud , and never resting a moment ,</l>
      <l n="103">In the rude delight , the boisterous gladness of childhood ,—</l>
      <l n="104">Cruel as summer sun and singing-birds to the heartsick .</l>
      <l n="105">Clement sat in his chair unmoved in the midst of the hubbub ,</l>
      <l n="106">Rapt , with unseeing eyes ; and unafraid in their gambols ,</l>
      <l n="107">By his tawny beard the children caught him , and clambered</l>
      <l n="108">Over his knees , and waged a mimic warfare across them ,</l>
      <l n="109">Made him their battle-ground , and won and lost kingdoms upon him .</l>
      <l n="110">Airily to and fro , and out of one room to another</l>
      <l n="111">Passed his cousin , and busied herself with things of the household ,</l>
      <l n="112">Nonchalant , debonair , blithe , with bewitching housewifely</l>
      <l n="113">importance ,</l>
      <l n="114">Laying the cloth for the supper , and bringing the meal from the</l>
      <l n="115">kitchen ;</l>
      <l n="116">Fairer than ever she seemed , and more than ever she mocked him ,</l>
      <l n="117">Coming behind his chair , and clasping her fingers together</l>
      <l n="118">Over his eyes in a girlish caprice , and crying , “ Who is it ? ”</l>
      <l n="119">Vexed his despair with a vision of wife and of home and of</l>
      <l n="120">children ,</l>
      <l n="121">Calling his sister 's children around her , and stilling their</l>
      <l n="122">clamor ,</l>
      <l n="123">Making believe they were hers . And Clement sat moody and silent ,</l>
      <l n="124">Blank to the wistful gaze of his mother bent on his visage</l>
      <l n="125">With the tender pain , the pitiful , helpless devotion</l>
      <l n="126">Of the mother that looks on the face of her son in his trouble ,</l>
      <l n="127">Grown beyond her consoling , and knows that she cannot befriend him .</l>
      <l n="128">Then his cousin laughed , and in idleness talked with the children ;</l>
      <l n="129">Sometimes she turned to him , and then when the thistle was falling ,</l>
      <l n="130">Caught it and twined it again in her hair , and called it her</l>
      <l n="131">keepsake ,</l>
      <l n="132">Smiled , and made him ashamed of his petulant gift there , before</l>
      <l n="133">them .</l>
      <l n="134">But , when the night was grown old and the two by the hearthstone</l>
      <l n="135">together</l>
      <l n="136">Sat alone in the flickering red of the flame , and the cricket</l>
      <l n="137">Carked to the stillness , and ever , with sullen throbs of the</l>
      <l n="138">pendule</l>
      <l n="139">Sighed the time-worn clock for the death of the days that were</l>
      <l n="140">perished ,—</l>
      <l n="141">It was her whim to be sad , and she brought him the book they were</l>
      <l n="142">reading .</l>
      <l n="143">“ Read it to-night , ” she said , “ that I may not seem to be going . ”</l>
      <l n="144">Said , and mutely reproached him with all the pain she had wrought</l>
      <l n="145">him .</l>
      <l n="146">From her hand he took the volume and read , and she listened ,—</l>
      <l n="147">All his voice molten in secret tears , and ebbing and flowing ,</l>
      <l n="148">Now with a faltering breath , and now with impassioned abandon ,—</l>
      <l n="149">Read from the book of a poet the rhyme of the fatally sundered ,</l>
      <l n="150">Fatally met too late , and their love was their guilt and their</l>
      <l n="151">anguish ,</l>
      <l n="152">But in the night they rose , and fled away into the darkness ,</l>
      <l n="153">Glad of all dangers and shames , and even of death , for their love 's</l>
      <l n="154">sake .</l>
      <l n="155">Then , when his voice brake hollowly , falling and fading to</l>
      <l n="156">silence ,</l>
      <l n="157">Thrilled in the silence they sat , and durst not behold one another ,</l>
      <l n="158">Feeling that wild temptation , that tender , ineffable yearning ,</l>
      <l n="159">Drawing them heart to heart . One blind , mad moment of passion</l>
      <l n="160">With their fate they strove ; but out of the pang of the conflict ,</l>
      <l n="161">Through such costly triumph as wins a waste and a famine ,</l>
      <l n="162">Victors they came , and Love retrieved the error of loving .</l>
      <l n="163">So , foreknowing the years , and sharply discerning the future ,</l>
      <l n="164">Guessing the riddle of life , and accepting the cruel solution ,—</l>
      <l n="165">Side by side they sat , as far as the stars are asunder .</l>
      <l n="166">Carked the cricket no more , but while the audible silence</l>
      <l n="167">Shrilled in their ears , she , suddenly rising and dragging the</l>
      <l n="168">thistle</l>
      <l n="169">Out of her clinging hair , laughed mockingly , casting it from her :</l>
      <l n="170">“ Perish the thorns and splendor ,— the bloom and the sweetness are</l>
      <l n="171">perished .</l>
      <l n="172">Dreary , respectable calm , polite despair , and one 's Duty ,—</l>
      <l n="173">These and the world , for dead Love !— The end of these modern</l>
      <l n="174">romances !</l>
      <l n="175">Better than yonder rhyme ?... Pleasant dreams and good night , Cousin</l>

      <l n="30">Weary as some illusion of fever to me was the ocean —</l>
      <l n="31">Storm-swept , scourged with bitter rains , and wandering always</l>
      <l n="32">Onward from sky to sky with endless processions of surges ,</l>
      <l n="33">Knowing not life nor death , but since the light was , the first day ,</l>
      <l n="34">Only enduring unrest till the darkness possess it , the last day .</l>
      <l n="35">Over its desolate depths we voyaged away from all living :</l>
      <l n="36">All the world behind us waned into vaguest remoteness ;</l>
      <l n="37">Names , and faces , and scenes recurred like that broken remembrance</l>
      <l n="38">Of the anterior , bodiless life of the spirit ,— the trouble</l>
      <l n="39">Of a bewildered brain , or the touch of the Hand that created ,—</l>
      <l n="40">And when the ocean ceased at last like a faded illusion ,</l>
      <l n="41">Europe itself seemed only a vision of eld and of sadness .</l>
      <l n="42">Naught but the dark in my soul remained to me constant and real ,</l>
      <l n="43">Growing and taking the thoughts bereft of happier uses ,</l>
      <l n="44">Blotting all sense of lapse from the days that with swift iteration</l>
      <l n="45">Were and were not . They fable the bright days the fleetest :</l>
      <l n="46">These that had nothing to give , that had nothing to bring or to</l>
      <l n="47">promise ,</l>
      <l n="48">Went as one day alone . For me was no alternation</l>
      <l n="49">Save from my dull despair to wild and reckless rebellion ,</l>
      <l n="50">When the regret for my sin was turned to ruthless self-pity —</l>
      <l n="51">When I hated him whose love had made me its victim ,</l>
      <l n="52">Through his faith and my falsehood yet claiming me . Then I was</l>
      <l n="53">smitten</l>
      <l n="54">With so great remorse , such grief for him , and compassion ,</l>
      <l n="55">That , if he could have come back to me , I had welcomed and loved</l>
      <l n="56">him</l>
      <l n="57">More than man ever was loved . Alas , for me that another</l>
      <l n="58">Holds his place in my heart evermore ! Alas , that I listened</l>
      <l n="59">When the words , whose daring lured my spirit and lulled it ,</l>
      <l n="60">Seemed to take my blame away with my will of resistance !</l>

      <l n="64">What I could to be faithful still to the past and my penance ;</l>
      <l n="65">And as we stood that night in the old Roman garden together —</l>
      <l n="66">By the fountain whose passionate tears but now had implored me</l>
      <l n="67">In his pleading voice — and he waited my answer , I told him</l>
      <l n="68">All that had been before of delusion and guilt , and conjured him</l>
      <l n="69">Not to darken his fate with mine . The costly endeavor</l>
      <l n="70">Only was subtler betrayal . O me , from the pang of confession ,</l>
      <l n="71">Sprang what strange delight , as I tore from its lurking that</l>
      <l n="72">horror —</l>
      <l n="73">Brooded upon so long — with the hope that at last I might see it</l>
      <l n="74">Through his eyes , unblurred by the tears that disordered my vision !</l>
      <l n="75">Oh , with what rapturous triumph I humbled my spirit before him ,</l>
      <l n="76">That he might lift me and soothe me , and make that dreary</l>
      <l n="77">remembrance ,</l>
      <l n="78">All this confused present , seem only some sickness of fancy ,</l>
      <l n="79">Only a morbid folly , no certain and actual trouble !</l>
      <l n="80">If from that refuge I fled with words of too feeble denial —</l>
      <l n="81">Bade him hate me , with sobs that entreated his tenderest pity ,</l>
      <l n="82">Moved mute lips and left the meaningless farewell unuttered —</l>
      <l n="83">She that never has loved , alone can wholly condemn me .</l>

      <l n="132">And her phantasmal show , through all , of being and doing —</l>
      <l n="133">Came a strange joy to us , untouched by regret for the idle</l>
      <l n="134">Days without yesterdays that died into nights without morrows .</l>
      <l n="135">Here , in our paradise of love we reigned , new-created ,</l>
      <l n="136">As in the youth of the world , in the days before evil and</l>

      <l n="138">Ah ! in our fair , lost world was neither fearing nor doubting ,</l>
      <l n="139">Neither the sickness of old remorse nor the gloom of foreboding ,—</l>
      <l n="140">Only the glad surrender of all individual being</l>

     <l n="1">Golden the sunset gleamed , above the city behind us ,</l>
     <l n="2">Out of a city of clouds as fairy and lovely as Venice ,</l>
     <l n="3">While we looked at the fishing-tails of purple and yellow</l>
     <l n="4">Far on the rim of the sea , whose light and musical surges</l>
     <l n="5">Broke along the sands with a faint , reiterant sadness .</l>
     <l n="6">But , when the sails had darkened into black wings , through the</l>
     <l n="7">twilight</l>
     <l n="8">Sweeping away into night — past the broken tombs of the Hebrews</l>
     <l n="9">Homeward we sauntered slowly , through dew-sweet , blossomy alleys ;</l>
     <l n="10">So drew near the boat by errant and careless approaches ,</l>
     <l n="11">Entered , and left with indolent pulses the Lido behind us .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="12">All the sunset had paled , and the campanili of Venice</l>
     <l n="13">Rose like the masts of a mighty fleet moored there in the water .</l>
     <l n="14">Lights flashed furtively to and fro through the deepening twilight .</l>
     <l n="15">Massed in one thick shade lay the Gardens ; the numberless islands</l>
     <l n="16">Lay like shadows upon the lagoons . And on us as we loitered</l>
     <l n="17">By their enchanted coasts , a spell of ineffable sweetness</l>
     <l n="18">Fell and made us at one with them ; and silent and blissful</l>
     <l n="19">Shadows we seemed , that drifted on through a being of shadow ,</l>
     <l n="20">Vague , indistinct to ourselves , unbounded by hope or remembrance .</l>
     <l n="21">Yet we knew the beautiful night , as it grew from the evening :</l>
     <l n="22">Far beneath us and far above us the vault of the heavens</l>
     <l n="23">Glittered and darkened ; and now the moon , that had haunted the</l>
     <l n="24">daylight</l>
     <l n="25">Thin and pallid , dimmed the stars with her fulness of splendor ,</l>
     <l n="26">And over all the lagoons fell the silvery rain of the moonbeams ,</l>
     <l n="27">As in the song the young girls sang while their gondolas passed</l>

     <l n="32">How from my despair are thy peace and loveliness frightened !</l>
     <l n="33">For , while our boat lay there at the will of the light undulations ,</l>
     <l n="34">Idle as if our mood imbued and controlled it , yet ever</l>
     <l n="35">Seeming to bear us on athwart those shining expanses</l>
     <l n="36">Out to shining seas beyond pursuit or returning —</l>

     <l n="39">Down the mirrored night another gondola drifted</l>
     <l n="40">Nearer and slowly nearer our own , and moonlighted faces</l>
     <l n="41">Stared . And that sweet trance grew a rigid and dreadful possession ,</l>
     <l n="42">Which , if no dream indeed , yet mocked with such semblance of</l>

     <l n="44">That , as it happens in dreams , when a dear face , stooping to kiss</l>
     <l n="45">us ,</l>
     <l n="46">Takes , ere the lips have touched , some malign and horrible aspect ,</l>
     <l n="47">His face faded away , and the face of the Dead — of that other —</l>
     <l n="48">Flashed on mine , and writhing , through every change of emotion ,—</l>
     <l n="49">Wild amaze and scorn , accusation and pitiless mocking ,—</l>

   <note>POSTSCRIPT . Since , he has shown me a letter in which he absolves and forgives her ( Philip , of course , not Fred ; and the other , of course , and not Annie ) . Do n't you think him generous , noble , unselfish , heroic ? L'ENVOY .— Clara 's Comment . Well , I 'm glad , I am sure , if Fanny supposes she 's happy . I 've no doubt her lover is good and noble — as men go . But , as regards his release of a woman who 'd wholly forgot him , And whom he loved no longer , for one whom he loves , and who loves him , I do n't exactly see where the heroism commences . THE SONG THE ORIOLE SINGS . There is a bird that comes and sings In the Professor 's garden-trees ; Upon the English oak he swings , And tilts and tosses in the breeze . I know his name , I know his note , That so with rapture takes my soul ; Like flame the gold beneath his throat , His glossy cope is black as coal . O oriole , it is the song You sang me from the cottonwood , Too young to feel that I was young , Too glad to guess if life were good . And while I hark , before my door , Adown the dusty Concord Road , The blue Miami flows once more As by the cottonwood it flowed . And on the bank that rises steep , And pours a thousand tiny rills , From death and absence laugh and leap My school-mates to their flutter-mills . The blackbirds jangle in the tops Of hoary-antlered sycamores ; The timorous killdee starts and stops Among the drift-wood on the shores . Below , the bridge — a noonday fear Of dust and shadow shot with sun — Stretches its gloom from pier to pier , Far unto alien coasts unknown . And on those alien coasts , above , Where silver ripples break the stream 's Long blue , from some roof-sheltering grove A hidden parrot scolds and screams . Ah , nothing , nothing ! Commonest things : A touch , a glimpse , a sound , a breath — It is a song the oriole sings — And all the rest belongs to death . But oriole , my oriole , Were some bright seraph sent from bliss With songs of heaven to win my soul From simple memories such as this , What could he tell to tempt my ear From you ? What high thing could there be , So tenderly and sweetly dear As my lost boyhood is to me ? PORDENONE . I . Hard by the Church of Saint Stephen , in sole and beautiful Venice , Under the colonnade of the Augustinian Convent , Every day , as I passed , I paused to look at the frescos Painted upon the ancient walls of the court of the Convent By a great master of old , who wore his sword and his dagger While he wrought the figures of patriarchs , martyrs , and virgins Into the sacred and famous scenes of Scriptural story . II . Long ago the monks from their snug self-devotion were driven , Wistful and fat and slow : looking backward , I fancied them going Out through the sculptured doorway , and down the Ponte de'Frati , Cowled and sandalled and beaded , a plump and pensive procession ; And in my day their cells were barracks for Austrian soldiers , Who in their turn have followed the Augustinian Friars . As to the frescos , little remained of work once so perfect . Summer and winter weather of some three cycles had wasted ; Plaster had fallen , and left unsightly blotches of ruin ; Wanton and stupid neglect had done its worst to the pictures : Yet to the sympathetic and reverent eye was apparent — Where the careless glance but found , in expanses of plaster , Touches of incoherent color and lines interrupted — Somewhat still of the life of surpassing splendor and glory Filling the frescos once ; and here and there was a figure , Standing apart , and out from the common decay and confusion , Flushed with immortal youth and ineffaceable beauty , Such as that figure of Eve in pathetic expulsion from Eden , Taking — the tourist remembers — the wrath of Heaven al fresco , As is her well-known custom in thousands of acres of canvas . III . I could make out the much-bepainted Biblical subjects , When I had patience enough : The Temptation , of course , and Expulsion ; Cain killing Abel , his Brother — the merest fragment of murder ; Noah 's Debauch — the trunk of the sea-faring patriarch naked , And the garment , borne backward to cover it , fearfully tattered ; Abraham offering Isaac — no visible Isaac , and only Abraham 's lifted knife held back by the hovering angel ; Martyrdom of Saint Stephen — a part of the figure of Stephen ; And the Conversion of Paul — the greaves on the leg of a soldier Held across the back of a prostrate horse by the stirrup ; But when I looked at the face of that tearful and beauteous figure ,— Eve in the fresco there , and , in Venice of old , Violante , As I must fain believe ( the lovely daughter of Palma , Who was her father 's Saint Barbara , and was the Bella of Titian ) ,— Such a meaning and life shone forth from its animate presence As could restore those vague and ineffectual pictures , With their pristine colors , and fill them with light and with movement . Nay , sometimes it could blind me to all the present about me , Till I beheld no more the sausage-legged Austrian soldiers , Where they stood on guard beside one door of the Convent , Nor the sentinel beggars that watched the approach to the other ; Neither the bigolanti , the broad-backed Friulan maidens , Drawing the water with clatter and splashing , and laughter and gossip , Out of the carven well in the midst of the court of the Convent — No , not even the one with the mole on her cheek and the sidelong Look , as she ambled forth with her buckets of bronze at her shoulder , Swinging upon the yoke to and fro , a-drip and a-glimmer . All in an instant was changed , and once more the cloister was peopled By the serene monks of old , and against walls of the cloisters , High on his scaffolding raised , Pordenone<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>wrought at his frescos . Armed with dagger and sword , as the legend tells , against Titian , Who was his rival in art and in love . IV . It seemed to be summer , In the forenoon of the day ; and the master 's diligent pencil Laid its last light touches on Eve driven forth out of Eden , Otherwise Violante , and while his pupils about him Wrought and chattered , in silence ran the thought of the painter : “ She , and forever she ! Is it come to be my perdition ? Shall I , then , never more make the face of a beautiful woman But it must take her divine , accursèd beauty upon it , And , when I finish my work , stand forth her visible presence ? Ah ! I could take this sword and strike it into her bosom ! Though I believe my own heart 's blood would stream from the painting , So much I love her ! Yes , that look is marvellous like you , Wandering , tender — such as I 'd give my salvation to win you Once to bend upon me ! But I knew myself better than make you , Lest I should play the fool about you here before people , Helpless to turn away from your violet eyes , Violante , That have turned all my life to a vision of madness . ” The painter Here unto speech betraying the thoughts he had silently pondered , “ Visions , visions , my son ? ” said a gray old friar who listened , Seated there in the sun , with his eye on the work of the painter Fishily fixed , while the master blasphemed behind his mustaches . “ Much have I envied your Art , who vouchsafeth to those who adore her Visions of heavenly splendor denied to fastings and vigils . I have spent days and nights of faint and painful devotion , Scourged myself almost to death , without one glimpse of the glory Which your touch has revealed in the face of that heavenly maiden . Pleasure me to repeat what it was you were saying of visions : Fain would I know how they come to you , though I never see them , And in my thickness of hearing I fear some words have escaped me . ” Then , while the painter glared on the lifted face of the friar , Baleful , breathless , bewildered , fiercer than noon in the dog-days , Round the circle of pupils there ran a tittering murmur ; From the lips to the ears of those nameless Beppis and Gigis Buzzed the stinging whisper : “ Let 's hear Pordenone 's confession . ” Well they knew the master 's luckless love , and whose portrait He had unconsciously painted there , and guessed that his visions Scarcely were those conceived by the friar , who constantly blundered Round the painter at work , mistaking every subject — Noah 's drunken Debauch for the Stoning of Stephen the Martyr , And the Conversion of Paul for the Flight into Egypt ; forever Putting his hand to his ear and shouting , “ Speak louder , I pray you ! ” So they waited now , in silent , amused expectation , Till Pordenone 's angry scorn should gather to bursting . Long the painter gazed in furious silence , then slowly Uttered a kind of moan , and turned again to his labor . Tears gathered into his eyes , of mortification and pathos , And when the dull old monk , who forgot , while he waited the answer , Visions and painter , and all , had maundered away in his error , Pordenone half envied the imbecile peace of his bosom ; “ For in my own , ” he mused , “ is such a combat of devils , That I believe torpid age or stupid youth would be better Than this manhood of mine that has climbed aloft to discover Heights which I never can reach , and bright on the pinnacle standing In the unfading light , my rival crowned victor above me . If I could hint what I feel , what forever escapes from my pencil , All after-time should know my will was not less than my failure , Nor should any one dare remember me merely in pity . All should read my sorrows and do my discomfiture homage , Saying : ‘ Not meanly at any time this painter meant or endeavored ; His was the anguish of one who falls short of the highest achievement , Conscious of doing his utmost , and knowing how vast his defeat is . Life , if he would , might have had some second guerdon to give him , But he would only the first ; and behold ! Let us honor Grief such as his must have been ; no other sorrow can match it ! There are certainly some things here that are nobly imagined : Look ! here is masterly power in this play of light , and these shadows Boldly are massed ; and what color ! One can well understand Buonarotti Saying the sight of his Curtius was worth the whole journey from Florence . Here is a man at least never less than his work ; you can feel it As you can feel in Titian 's the painter 's inferior spirit . He and this Pordenone , you know , were rivals ; and Titian Knew how to paint to the popular humor , and spared not Foul means or fair ( his way with rivals ) to crush Pordenone , Who with an equal chance ’ — “ Alas , if the whole world should tell me I was his equal in art , and the lie could save me from torment , So must I be lost , for my soul could never believe it ! Nay , let my envy snarl as fierce as it will at his glory , Still , when I look on his work , my soul makes obeisance within me , Humbling itself before the touch that shall never be equalled . ” He who sleeps in continual noise is wakened by silence , And Pordenone was roused from these thoughts anon by the sudden Hush that had fallen upon the garrulous group of his pupils ; And ere he turned half-way with instinctive looks of inquiry , He was already warned , with a shock at the heart , of a presence Long attended , not feared ; and he laid one hand on his sword-hilt , Seizing the sheath with the other hand , that the pallet had dropped from . Then he fronted Titian , who stood with his arms lightly folded , And with a curious smile , half of sarcasm , half of compassion , Bent on th ’ embattled painter , cried : “ Your slave , Messere Antonio ! What good friend has played this bitter jest with your humor ? As I beheld you just now full-armed with your pencil and palette , I was half awed by your might ; but these sorry trappings of bravo Make me believe you less fit to be the rival of Titian , Here in the peaceful calm of our well-ordered city of Venice , Than to take service under some Spanish lordling at Naples , Needy in blades for work that can not wait for the poison . ” Pordenone flushed with anger and shame to be taken At an unguarded point ; but he answered with scornful defiance : “ Oh , you are come , I see , with the favorite weapon of Titian , And you would make a battle of words . If you care for my counsel , Listen to me : I say you are skilfuller far in my absence , And your tongue can inflict a keener and deadlier mischief When it is dipped in poisonous lies , and wielded in secret . ” “ Nay , then , ” Titian responded , “ methinks that our friend Aretino<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>Makes a much better effect than either of us in that tongue-play . But since Messer Robusti has measured our wit for his portrait , Even he has grown shyer of using his tongue than he once was . Have you not heard the tale ? Tintoretto was told Aretino Meant to make him the subject of one of his merry effusions ; And with his naked dirk he went carefully over his person , Promising , if the poet made free with him in his verses , He would immortalize my satirical friend with that pencil . Doubtless the tale is not true . Aretino says nothing about it ; Always speaks , in fact , with the highest respect of Robusti . True or not , ‘ tis well found . ” Then looking around on the frescos : “ Good , very good indeed ! Your breadth and richness and softness No man living surpasses ; those heads are truly majestic . Yes , Buonarotti was right , when he said that to look at your Curtius Richly repaid him the trouble and cost of a journey from Florence . Surely the world shall know you the first of painters in fresco ! Well ? You will not strike me unarmed ? This was hardly expected By the good people that taught you to think our rivalry blood-red . Let us be friends , Pordenone ! ” “ Be patron and patronized , rather ; Nay , if you spoke your whole mind out , be assassin and victim . Could the life beat again in the broken heart of Giorgione , He might tell us , I think , something pleasant of friendship with Titian . ” Suddenly over the shoulder of Titian peered an ironical visage , Smiling , malignly intent — the leer of the scurrilous poet : “ You know — all the world knows — who dug the grave of Giorgione .<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>Titian and he were no friends — our Lady of Sorrows forgive ‘ em ! But for all hurt that Titian did him he might have been living , Greater than any living , and lord of renown and such glory As would have left you both dull as yon withered moon in the sunshine . ” Loud laughed the listening group at the insolent gibe of the poet , Stirring the gall to its depths in the bitter soul of their master , Who with his tremulous fingers tapped the hilt of his poniard , Answering naught as yet . Anon the glance of the ribald , Carelessly ranging from Pordenone 's face to the picture , Dwelt with an absent light on its marvellous beauty , and kindled Into a slow recognition , with “ Ha ! Violante ! ” Then , erring Wilfully as to the subject , he cackled his filthy derision : “ What have we here ! More Magdalens yet of the painter 's acquaintance ? Ah —! ” The words had scarce left his lips , when the painter Rushed upon him , and clutching his throat , thrust him backward and held him Over the scaffolding 's edge in air , and straightway had flung him Crashing down on the pave of the cloister below , but for Titian , Who around painter and poet alike wound his strong arms and stayed them Solely , until the bewildered pupils could come to the rescue . Then , as the foes relaxed that embrace of frenzy and murder — White , one with rage and the other with terror , and either with hatred — Grimly the great master smiled : “ You were much nearer paradise , Piero , Than you have been for some time . Be ruled now by me and get homeward Fast as you may , and be thankful . ” And then , as the poet , Looking neither to right nor to left , amid the smiles of the pupils Tottered along the platform , and trembling descended the ladder Down to the cloister pave , and , still without upward or backward Glance , disappeared beneath the outer door of the Convent , Titian turned again to the painter : “ Farewell , Pordenone ! Learn more fairly to know me . I envy you not ; and no rival Now , or at any time , have I held you , or ever shall hold you . Prosper and triumph still , for all me : you shall but do me honor , Seeing that I too serve the art that your triumphs illustrate . I for my part find life too short for work and for pleasure ; If it should touch a century 's bound , I should think it too precious Even to spare a moment for rage at another 's good fortune . Do not be fooled by the purblind flatterers who would persuade you Either of us shall have greater fame through the fall of the other . We can thrive only in common . The tardily blossoming cycles , Flowering at last in this glorious age of our art , had not waited , Folded calyxes still , for Pordenone or Titian . Think you if we had not been , our pictures had never been painted ? Others had done them , or better , the same . We are only Pencils God paints with . And think you that He had wanted for pencils But for our being at hand ? And yet — for some virtue creative Dwells and divinely exists in the being of every creature , So that the thing done through him is dear as if he had done it — If I should see your power , a tint of this great efflorescence , Fading , methinks I should feel myself beginning to wither . They have abused your hate who told you that Titian was jealous . Once , in my youth that is passed , I too had my hates and my envies . ‘ Sdeath ! how it used to gall me — that power and depth of Giorgione ! I could have turned my knife in his heart when I looked at his portraits . Ah ! we learn somewhat still as the years go . Now , when I see you Doing this good work here , I am glad in my soul of its beauty . Art is not ours , O friend ! but if we are not hers , we are nothing . Look at the face you painted last year — or yesterday , even : Far , so far , it seems from you , so utterly , finally , parted , Nothing is stranger to you than this child of your soul ; and you wonder — ‘ Did I indeed then do it ? ’ No thrill of the rapture of doing Stirs in your breast at the sight . Nay , then , not even the beauty Which we had seemed to create is our own : the frame universal Is as much ours . And shall I hate you because you are doing That which when done you cannot feel yours more than I mine can feel it ? It shall belong hereafter to all who perceive and enjoy it , Rather than him who made it ; he , least of all , shall enjoy it . They of the Church conjure us to look on death and be humble ; I say , look upon life and keep your pride if you can , then : See how to-day 's achievement is only to-morrow 's confusion ; See how possession always cheapens the thing that was precious To our endeavor ; how losses and gains are equally losses ; How in ourselves we are nothing , and how we are anything only As indifferent parts of the whole , that still , on our ceasing , Whole remains as before , no less without us than with us . Were it not for the delight of doing , the wonderful instant Ere the thing done is done and dead , life scarce were worth living . Ah , but that makes life divine ! We are gods , for that instant immortal , Mortal for evermore , with a few days ’ rumor — or ages ’ — What does it matter ? We , too , have our share of eating and drinking , Love , and the liking of friends — mankind 's common portion and pleasure . Come , Pordenone , with me ; I would fain have you see my Assumption While it is still unfinished , and stay with me for the evening : You shall send home for your lute , and I 'll ask Sansovino to supper .<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>After what happened just now I scarcely could ask Aretino ; Though , for the matter of that , the dog is not one to bear malice . Will you not come ? ” V. I listen with Titian , and wait for the answer . But , whatever the answer that comes to Titian , I hear none . Nay , while I linger , all those presences fade into nothing , In the dead air of the past ; and the old Augustinian Convent Lapses to picturesque profanation again as a barrack ; Lapses and changes once more , and this time vanishes wholly , Leaving me at the end with the broken , shadowy legend , Broken and shadowy still , as in the beginning . I linger , Teased with its vague unfathomed suggestion , and wonder , As at first I wondered , what happened about Violante , And am but ill content with those metaphysical phrases Touching the strictly impersonal nature of personal effort , Wherewithal Titian had fain avoided the matter at issue . FOOTNOTES :<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>Giovanni Antonio Licinio , called Pordenone from his birth-place in the Friuli , was a contemporary of Titian 's , whom he equalled in many qualities , and was one of the most eminent Venetian painters in fresco .<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>Pietro Aretino , the satirical poet , was a friend of Titian , whose house he frequented . The story of Tintoretto 's measuring him for a portrait with his dagger is well known .<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>Giorgione ( Giorgio Barbarelli ) was Titian 's fellow-pupil and rival in the school of Bellini . He died at thirty-four , after a life of great triumphs and excesses .<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>Sansovino , the architect , was a familiar guest at Titian 's table , in his house near the Fondamenta Nuove . THE LONG DAYS . Yes ! they are here again , the long , long days , After the days of winter , pinched and white ; Soon , with a thousand minstrels comes the light , Late , the sweet robin-haunted dusk delays . But the long days that bring us back the flowers , The sunshine , and the quiet-dripping rain , And all the things we knew of spring again , The long days bring not the long-lost long hours . The hours that now seem to have been each one A summer in itself , a whole life 's bound , Filled full of deathless joy — where in his round , Have these forever faded from the sun ? The fret , the fever , the unrest endures , But the time flies .... Oh , try , my little lad , Coming so hot and play-worn , to be glad And patient of the long hours that are yours !
