Tales of my Nursery ! shall that still loved spot , That window corner , ever be forgot , Where through the woodbine when with upward ray Gleam 'd the last shadow of departing day , Still did I sit , and with unwearied eye , Read while I wept , and scarcely paused to sigh ! In that gay drawer , with fairy fictions stored , When some new tale was added to my hoard , While o'er each page my eager glance was flung , ‘ Twas but to learn what female fate was sung ; If no sad maid the castle shut from light , I heeded not the giant and the knight . Sweet Cinderella , even before the ball , How did I love thee — ashes , rags , and all ! What bliss I deem 'd it to have stood beside , On every virgin when thy shoe was tried ! How long 'd to see thy shape the slipper suit ! But , dearer than the slipper , loved the foot .</docImprint>

    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">It were greatly to be desired that the instructors of our children could be persuaded how much is lost by rejecting the venerable relics of nursery traditional literature , and substituting in their place the present cold , unimaginative ,— I had almost said , unnatural ,— prosaic good-boy stories . “ In the latter case , ” observes Sir Walter Scott , “ their minds are , as it were , put into the stocks , like their feet at the dancing-school , and the moral always consists in good conduct being crowned with success . Truth is , I would not give one tear shed over Little Red Riding Hood for all the benefit to be derived from a hundred histories of Jemmy Goodchild . I think the selfish tendencies will be soon enough acquired in this arithmetical age ; and that , to make the higher class of character , our own wild fictions — like our own simple music — will have more effect in awakening the fancy and elevating the disposition , than the colder and more elaborate compositions of modern authors and composers . ”</p>
    <p n="2">Deeply impressed with this truth , and firmly convinced of the “ imagination-nourishing ” power of the wild and fanciful lore of the old nursery , I have spared no labour in collecting the fragments which have been traditionally preserved in our provinces . The object is not so much to present to the reader a few literary trifles , though even their curiosity and value in several important discussions must not be despised , as to rescue in order to restore ; a solemn recompense due from literature for having driven them away ; and to recall the memory to early associations , in the hope that they who love such recollections will not suffer the objects of them to disappear with the present generation .</p>
    <p n="3">In arranging the materials gathered for this little volume , I have followed , in some respects , the plan adopted by Mr. Robert Chambers , in his elegant work , the Popular Rhymes of Scotland ; but our vernacular anthology will be found to contain so much which does not occur in any shape in that of the sister country , that the two collections have not as much similarity as might have been expected . Together , they will eventually contain nearly all that is worth preserving of what may be called the natural literature of Great Britain . Mr . Chambers , indeed , may be said to have already exhausted the subject for his own land in the last edition of his interesting publication , but no systematic attempt has yet been made in the same direction for this country ; and although the curiosity and extent of the relics I have been enabled to collect have far exceeded my expectations , I am fully aware how much more can yet be accomplished . An additional number of foreign synonymes could also no doubt be collected ; though perhaps more easily by foreigners , for Continental works which contain notices of traditional literature are procured with difficulty in England . The following pages , however , contain sufficient of these to exhibit the striking similarities between rhymes prevalent over England , and others which exist in the North of Europe .</p>
    <p n="4">The collection of Nursery Tales is not as extensive as could have been wished , but the difficulty of procuring the brief traditional stories which were current some century since , now for the most part only recollected in obscure districts , is so great , that no apology is necessary for the apparent deficiency of that section . The few which have been obtained are of considerable curiosity and interest ; and I would venture to suggest to all readers of these pages the great obligation they would confer by the communication of any additions . Stories of this kind are undoubtedly to be obtained from oral tradition , and perhaps some of literary importance may yet be recovered .</p>
    <p n="5">The compiler 's best thanks are due to Captain Henry Smith for the very interesting communication of rhymes current in the Isle of Wight ; to Mr. George Stephens for several curious fragments , and valuable references to Swedish songs ; and to many kind correspondents who have furnished me with rhymes current in the various districts in which they reside . It is only by a large provincial correspondence that a collection of this kind can be rendered complete , and the minutest information on any of our popular tales or rhymes , forwarded to the address given below , would be most thankfully and carefully acknowledged .</p>

    <docTitle><titlePart>POPULAR RHYMES AND NURSERY TALES . I .— NURSERY ANTIQUITIES . Although the names of Scott and Grimm may be enumerated amongst the writers who have acknowledged the ethnological and philosophic value of traditional nursery literature , it is difficult to impress on the public mind the importance of a subject apparently in the last degree trifling and insignificant , or to induce an opinion that the jingles and simple narratives of a garrulous nurse can possess a worth beyond the circle of their own immediate influence . But they who despise the humbler sources of literary illustration must be content to be told , and hereafter to learn , that traces of the simplest stories and most absurd superstitions are often more effectual in proving the affinity of different races , and determining other literary questions , than a host of grander and more imposing monuments . The history of fiction is continually efficacious in discussions of this kind , and the identities of puerile sayings frequently answer a similar purpose . Both , indeed , are of high value . The humble chap-book is found to be descended not only from medieval romance , but also not unfrequently from the more ancient mythology , whilst some of our simplest nursery-rhymes are chanted to this day by the children of Germany , Denmark , and Sweden , a fact strikingly exhibiting their great antiquity and remote origin . The subject , however curious and interesting , is far too diffuse to be investigated at any length in a work like the present ; and , indeed , the materials are for the most part so scattered and difficult of access , that it would require the research of many years to accomplish the task satisfactorily . I shall , then , content myself with indicating a few of the most striking analogies between the rhymes of foreign countries and those of our own , for this portion of the inquiry has been scarcely alluded to by my predecessors . With regard to the tales , a few notices of their antiquity will be found in the prefaces or notes to the stories themselves , and few readers will require to be informed that Whittington 's cat realized his price in India , and that Arlotto related the story long before the Lord Mayor was born ; that Jack the Giant-killer is founded on an Edda ; or that the slipper of Cinderella finds a parallel in the history of the celebrated Rhodope . To enter into these discussions would be merely to repeat an oft-told tale , and I prefer offering a few notes which will be found to possess a little more novelty . Of the many who must recollect the nursery jingles of their youth , how few in number are those who have suspected their immense age , or that they were ever more than unmeaning nonsense ; far less that their creation belongs to a period before that at which the authentic records of our history commence . Yet there is no exaggeration in such a statement . We find the same trifles which erewhile lulled or amused the English infant , are current in slightly varied forms throughout the North of Europe ; we know that they have been sung in the northern countries for centuries , and that there has been no modern outlet for their dissemination across the German Ocean . The most natural inference is to adopt the theory of a Teutonic origin , and thus give to every genuine child-rhyme , found current in England and Sweden , an immense antiquity . There is nothing improbable in the supposition , for the preservation of the relics of primitive literature often bears an inverse ratio to their importance . Thus , for example , a well-known English nursery rhyme tells us ,— There was an old man , And he had a calf , And that 's half ; He took him out of the stall , And put him on the wall , And that 's all . A composition apparently of little interest or curiosity ; but Arwidsson , unacquainted with the English rhyme , produces the following as current in Sweden , Svenska Fornsanger , iii . 488 , which bears far too striking a similarity to the above to have had a different origin ,— Gubben och gumman hade en kalf , Och nu aer visan half ! Och begge sa koerde de halfven i vall , Och nu aer visan all ! We could not , perhaps , select a better instance of this kind of similarity in nepial songs as current throughout the great northern states of Europe than the pretty stanza on the ladybird . Variations of this familiar song belong to the vernacular literature of England , Germany , Denmark , and Sweden . The version at present current in the North of England is as follows : Lady-cow , lady-cow , fly thy way home , Thy house is on fire , thy children all gone ; All but one that ligs under a stone , Fly thee home , lady-cow , ere it be gone !<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>[ Footnote 1 : In Norfolk the lady-bird is called burny-bee , and the following lines are current : Burnie bee , burnie bee , Tell me when your wedding be . If it be to-morrow day , Take your wings and fly away . ] These lines are said by children , when they throw the beautiful little insect into the air , to make it take flight . Two Scottish variations are given by Mr . Chambers , p. 170 . In Germany it is called the Virgin Mary 's chafer , Marienwuermchen , or the May-chafer , Maikaeferchen , or the gold-bird , Guldvogel . In Sweden , gold-hen , gold-cow , or the Virgin Mary 's maid . In Denmark , our Lord 's hen , or our Lady 's hen . We may first mention the German song translated by Taylor as frequently alluded to by writers on this subject . The second verse is the only one preserved in England . Lady-bird ! lady-bird ! pretty one ! stay ! Come sit on my finger , so happy and gay ; With me shall no mischief betide thee ; No harm would I do thee , no foeman is near , I only would gaze on thy beauties so dear , Those beautiful winglets beside thee . Lady-bird ! lady-bird ! fly away home ; Thy house is a-fire , thy children will roam ! List ! list ! to their cry and bewailing ! The pitiless spider is weaving their doom , Then , lady-bird ! lady-bird ! fly away home ! Hark ! hark ! to thy children 's bewailing . Fly back again , back again , lady-bird dear ! Thy neighbours will merrily welcome thee here ; With them shall no perils attend thee ! They 'll guard thee so safely from danger or care , They 'll gaze on thy beautiful winglets so fair , And comfort , and love , and befriend thee !</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>In Des Knaben Wunderhorn , Arnim und Brentano ,<date>1808</date>, iii . 82 , 83 , 90 , we have three German songs relating to the lady-bird . The first two of these are here given : Der Guldvogel . Guldvogel , flieg aus , Flieg auf die Stangen , Kaesebrode langen ; Mir eins , dir eins , Alle gute G'sellen eins .</docImprint>
    <epigraph>
     <p>“ Gold-bird , get thee gone , fly to thy perch , bring cheese-cakes , one for me , one for thee , and one for all good people . ” Maikaeferchen , Maikaeferchen , fliege weg ! Dein Haeusgen brennt , Dein Muetterchen flennt , Dein Vater sitzt auf der Schwelle , Flieg in Himmel aus der Hoelle .</p>
    </epigraph>
    <docImprint>“ May-bird , May-bird , fly away . Thy house burns , thy mother weeps , thy father stays at his threshold , fly from hell into heaven ! ” — The third is not so similar to our version . Another German one is given in Kuhn und Schwark , Norddeutsche Sagen ,<date>1848</date>, p. 375 : Maikaeferchen , fliege , Dein Vater ist im Kriege , Dein Mutter ist in Pommerland , Pommerland ist abgebrannt ! Maikaeferchen , fliege . “ May-bird , fly . Thy father is in the war , thy mother is in Pomerania , Pomerania is burnt ! May-bird , fly . ” — See , also , Erk und Irmer , Die Deutschen Volkslieder ,<settlement>Berlin</settlement>,<date>1839</date>, iv . 7 , Das Maikaeferlied . For the two pretty Swedish songs which follow I am indebted to the MS. of Mr. Stephens . The first is common in the southern parts of that country , the other in the northern . Guld-hoena , guld-ko ! Flyg oester , flyg vester , Dit du flyger der bor din aelskade !</docImprint>
    <epigraph>
     <p>“ Gold-hen , gold-cow ! fly east , fly west , you will fly where your sweetheart is . ” Jungfru Marias Nyckelpiga ! Flyg oester , flyg vester , Flyg dit der min kaeresta bor !<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>[ Footnote 2 : This is a very remarkable coincidence with an English rhyme : Fly , lady-bird , fly ! North , south , east , or west ; Fly to the pretty girl That I love best . ] “ Fly , our holy Virgin 's bower-maid ! fly east , fly west , fly where my loved-one dwelleth . ” In Denmark they sing ( Thiele , iii . 134 ): Fly , fly , our Lord 's own hen ! To-morrow the weather fair will be , And eke the next day too .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>[ Footnote 3 : The lady-bird , observes Mr . Chambers , is always connected with fine weather in Germany and the north . ] Accumulative tales are of very high antiquity . The original of “ the House that Jack Built ” is well known to be an old Hebrew hymn in Sepher Haggadah . It is also found in Danish , but in a somewhat shorter form ; ( See Thiele , Danske Folkesagn , II . iii . 146 , Der har du det Huus som Jacob bygde ;) and the English version is probably very old , as may be inferred from the mention of “ the priest all shaven and shorn . ” A version of the old woman and her sixpence occurs in the same collection , II . iv . 161 , Konen och Grisen Fick , the old wife and her piggy Fick ,— “ There was once upon a time an old woman who had a little pig hight Fick , who would never go home late in the evening . So the old woman said to her stick : ‘ Stick , beat Fick , I say ! Piggie will not go home to-day ! ’ ”</p>
    </epigraph>
    <docImprint>This chant-tale is also common in Sweden . One copy has been printed by N. Lilja in his Violen en Samling Jullekar , Barnsanger och Sagor , i . 20 , Gossen och Geten Naeppa , the boy and the goat Neppa ,— “ There was once a yeoman who had a goat called Neppa , but Neppa would never go home from the field . The yeoman was therefore forced to promise his daughter in marriage to whoever could get Neppa home . Many tried their fortune in vain , but at last a sharp boy offered to ward the goat . All the next day he followed Neppa , and when evening came , he said , ‘ Now will we homeward go ? ’ but Neppa answered , ‘ Pluck me a tuft or so , ’ ” &amp; c. The story is conducted in an exactly similar manner in which the denouement is brought about in the English tale .<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>[ Footnote 4 : Two other variations occur in Arwidsson , Svenska Fornsanger ,<date>1842</date>, iii . 387-8 , and Mr. Stephens tells me he has a MS. Swedish copy entitled the Schoolboy and the Birch . It is also well known in Alsace , and is printed in that dialect in Stoeber 's Elsassisches Volksbuechlein ,<date>1842</date>, pp . 93-5 . Compare , also , Kuhn und Schwark , Norddeutsche Sagen , Maerchen und Gebraeuche ,<date>1848</date>, p. 358 , “ Die fra , dos hippel un dos hindel . ” ] The well-known song of “ There was a lady lov 'd a swine , ” is found in an unpublished play of the time of Charles I. in the Bodleian Library , MS. Bodl . 30 : There was a lady lov 'd a hogge ; Hony , quoth shee , Woo't thou lie with me to-night ? Ugh , quoth hee . A similar song is current in Sweden , as we learn from Arwidsson , Svenska Fornsanger , iii . 482 , who gives a version in which an old woman , who had no children , took a little foal , which she called Longshanks , and rocked and nursed it as if it had been her own child :[ 5 ] Gumman ville vagga Och inga barn hade hon ; Da tog hon in Foelungen sin , Och lade den i vaggan sin . Vyssa , vyssa , langskanken min , Langa ben bar du ; Lefver du till sommaren , Blir du lik far din . [ Footnote 5 : It is still more similar to a pretty little song in Chambers , p. 188 , commencing , “ There was a miller 's dochter . ” ] Another paradoxical song-tale , respecting the old woman who went to market , and had her petticoats cut off at her knees “ by a pedlar whose name was Stout , ” is found in some shape or other in most countries in Europe . A Norwegian version is given by Asbjoernsen og Moe , Norske Folkeeventyr ,<date>1843</date>, and , if I recollect rightly , it is also found in Grimm . The riddle-rhyme of “ Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall ” is , in one form or other , a favorite throughout Europe . A curious Danish version is given by Thiele , iii . 148 : Lille Trille Laae paa Hylde ; Lille Trille Faldt ned af Hylde . Ingen Mand I hele Land Lille Trille curere kan . Which may be thus translated : Little Trille Lay on a shelf : Little Trille Thence pitch 'd himself : Not all the men In our land , I ken , Can put Little Trille right again . And Mr. Stephens has preserved two copies in his MS. Swedish collections . The first is from the province of Upland : Thille Lille Satt pa take ’ ; Thille Lille Trilla ’ ner ; Ingen laekare i hela verlden Thille Lille laga kan. Thille Lille On the roof-tree sat ; Thille Lille Down fell flat ; Never a leech the world can show That Thille Lille can heal , I trow . Another from the province of Smaland : Lille Bulle Trilla ’ ner a skulle ; Ingen man i detta lan ’ Lille Bulle laga kan. Down on the shed Lille Bulle rolled ; Never a man in all this land Lille Bulle helpen can . It will now only be necessary to refer to the similarities pointed out in other parts of this work , to convince the reader that , at all events , a very fair case is made out for the truth of the positions we have contended for , if , indeed , sufficient evidence of their absolute truth is not adduced . They who are accustomed to researches of this kind , are too well aware of the facility with which the most plausible theories are frequently nullified by subsequent discovery ; but there appears in the present case to be numerous conditions insoluble by any other supposition than that of a common origin , and we are therefore fully justified in adopting it as proved . Turning to the nursery rhymes of our own country , it will tend materially to strengthen the results to which we have arrived , if we succeed in proving their antiquity in this island . We shall be enabled to do so satisfactorily , and to show that they are not the modern nonsense some folks may pronounce them to be . They illustrate the history and manners of the people for centuries . Here , for instance , is a relic in the form of a nursery rhyme , but in reality part of a political song , referring to the rebellious times of Richard the Second .<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>My father he died , I cannot tell how , But he left me six horses to drive out my plough ! With a wimmy lo ! wommy lo ! Jack Straw , blazey-boys ! Wimmy lo ! wommy lo ! wob , wob , wob ! [ Footnote 6 : I am here , and in a few other cases , quoting from myself . It may be necessary to say so , for my former collections on this subject have been appropriated — “ convey , the wise it call ” — in a work by a learned Doctor , the preface to which is an amusing instance of plagiarism . ] An infant of the nineteenth century recalling our recollection to Jack Straw and his “ blazey-boys ! ” Far better this than teaching history with notes “ suited to the capacity of the youngest . ” Another refers to Joanna of Castile , who visited the court of Henry the Seventh in<date>1506</date>: I had a little nut-tree , nothing would it bear But a golden nutmeg and a silver pear ; The King of<country>Spain</country>'s daughter came to visit me , And all for the sake of my little nut-tree . We have distinct evidence that the well-known rhyme ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>The King of<country>France</country>went up the hill , With twenty thousand men : The King of<country>France</country>came down the hill , And ne'er went up again — was composed before<date>1588</date>, It occurs in an old tract called Pigges Corantoe ,<date>1642</date>, where it is entitled “ Old Tarlton 's Song , ” referring to Tarlton the jester , who died in<date>1588</date>. The following one belongs to the seventeenth century : As I was going by Charing Cross , I saw a black man upon a black horse ; They told me it was King Charles the First ; Oh dear , my heart was ready to burst ! [ Footnote 7 : An early variation occurs in MS. Sloane<date>1489</date>: The king of<country>France</country>, and four thousand men , They drew their swords , and put them up again . ] Political nursery-rhymes , or rather political rhymes of a jingling character , which , losing their original application , are preserved only in the nursery , were probably common in the seventeenth century . The two just quoted have evidently an historical application . The manuscript miscellanies of the time of James I. and Charles I. contain several copies of literal rhymes not very unlike “ A , B , C , tumble-down D . ” In the reign of Charles II . political pasquinades constantly partook of the genuine nursery character . We may select the following example , of course put into the mouth of that sovereign , preserved in MS. Douce 357 , f. 124 , in the Bodleian Library : See-saw , sack-a-day ; Monmouth is a pretie boy , Richmond is another , Grafton is my onely joy , And why should I these three destroy To please a pious brother ? “ What is the rhyme for porringer ? ” was written on occasion of the marriage of Mary , the daughter of James Duke of York , afterwards James II ., with the young Prince of Orange : and the following alludes to William III . and George Prince of Denmark : William and Mary , George and Anne , Four such children had never a man : They put their father to flight and shame , And call 'd their brother a shocking bad name . Another nursery song on King William is not yet obsolete , but its application is not generally known . My authority is the title of it in MS. Harl . 7316 : As I walk 'd by myself , And talked to myself , Myself said unto me , Look to thyself , Take care of thyself , For nobody cares for thee . I answer 'd myself , And said to myself In the self-same repartee , Look to thyself , Or not look to thyself , The self-same thing will be . To this class of rhymes I may add the following on Dr. Sacheverel , which was obtained from oral tradition : Doctor Sacheverel Did very well , But Jacky Dawbin Gave him a warning . When there are no allusions to guide us , it is only by accident that we can hope to test the history and antiquity of these kind of scraps , but we have no doubt whatever that many of them are centuries old . The following has been traced to the time of Henry VI ., a singular doggerel , the joke of which consists in saying it so quickly that it cannot be told whether it is English or gibberish : In fir tar is , In oak none is , In mud eel is , In clay none is , Goat eat ivy , Mare eat oats . “ Multiplication is vexation , ” a painful reality to schoolboys , was found a few years ago in a manuscript dated<date>1570</date>; and the memorial lines , “ Thirty days hath September , ” occur in the Return from Parnassus , an old play printed in<date>1606</date>. Our own reminiscences of such matters , and those of Shakespeare , may thus have been identical ! “ To market , to market , to buy a plum-bun , ” is partially quoted in Florio 's New World of Words ,<date>1611</date>, in v. ‘ Abomba . ’ The old song of the “ Carrion Crow sat on an Oak , ” was discovered by me in MS. Sloane<date>1489</date>, of the time of Charles I ., but under a different form : Hic , hoc , the carrion crow , For I have shot something too low : I have quite missed my mark , And shot the poor sow to the heart ; Wife , bring treacle in a spoon , Or else the poor sow 's heart will down . “ Sing a song of sixpence ” is quoted by Beaumont and Fletcher . “ Buz , quoth the blue fly , ” which is printed in the nursery halfpenny books , belongs to Ben Jonson 's Masque of Oberon ; the old ditty of “ Three Blind Mice ” is found in the curious music book entitled Deuteromelia , or the Second Part of Musicke 's Melodie ,<date>1609</date>; and the song , “ When I was a little girl , I wash 'd my mammy 's dishes , ” is given by Aubrey in MS. Lansd . 231 . “ A swarm of bees in May , ” is quoted by Miege ,<date>1687</date>. And so on of others , fragments of old catches and popular songs being constantly traced in the apparently unmeaning rhymes of the nursery . Most of us have heard in time past the school address to a story-teller : Liar , liar , lick dish , Turn about the candlestick . Not very important lines , one would imagine , but they explain a passage in Chettle 's play of the Tragedy of Hoffman , or a Revenge for a Father , 4to . Lond ,<date>1631</date>, which would be partially inexplicable without such assistance : Lor .

The intention of the last speaker is sufficiently intelligible , but a future editor , anxious to investigate his author minutely , might search in vain for an explanation of licke dish . Another instance<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>of the antiquity of children 's rhymes I met with lately at Stratford-on-Avon , in a MS. of the seventeenth century , in the collection of the late Captain James Saunders , where , amongst common-place memoranda on more serious subjects , written about the year<date>1630</date>, occurred a version of one of our most favorite nursery songs : I had a little bonny nagg , His name was Dapple Gray ; And he would bring me to an ale-house A mile out of my way . [ Footnote 8 : A dance called Hey , diddle , diddle , is mentioned in the play of King Cambises , written about<date>1561</date>, and the several rhymes commencing with the words may have been original adaptations to that dance-tune . ] “ Three children sliding on the ice ” is founded on a metrical tale published at the end of a translation of Ovid de Arte Amandi ,<date>1662</date>.<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>The lines , There was an old woman Liv 'd under a hill , And if she be n't gone , She lives there still — [ Footnote 9 : See the whole poem in my Nursery Rhymes of<country>England</country>, ed .<date>1842</date>, p . 19 . ] form part of an old catch , printed in the Academy of Complements , ed .<date>1714</date>, p. 108 . The same volume ( p. 140 ) contains the original words to another catch , which has been corrupted in its passage to the nursery : There was an old man had three sons , Had three sons , had three sons ; There was an old man had three sons , Jeffery , James , and Jack . Jeffery was hang 'd and James was drown 'd , And Jack was lost , that he could not be found , And the old man fell into a swoon , For want of a cup of sack ! It is not improbable that Shakespeare , who has alluded so much and so intricately to the vernacular rural literature of his day , has more notices of nursery-rhymes and tales than research has hitherto elicited . I am only acquainted with one reference to the former , “ Pillicock sat on Pillicock hill , ” which is quoted by Edgar in King Lear , iii . 4 , and is found in Gammer Gurton 's Garland , and in most modern collections of English nursery-rhymes . The secret meaning is not very delicate , nor is it necessary to enter into any explanation on the subject . It may , however , be worthy of remark , that the term pillicock is found in a manuscript ( Harl . 913 ) in the British Museum of the thirteenth century . English children accompanied their amusements with trivial verses from a very early period , but as it is only by accident that any allusions to them have been made , it is difficult to sustain the fact by many examples . The Nomenclator or Remembrancer of Adrianus Junius , translated by Higins , and edited by Fleming , 8vo .<date>1585</date>, contains a few notices of this kind ; p. 298 , “ {~ GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER NU ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA ~}, the playe called one penie , one penie , come after me ; {~ GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER NU ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA ~}, the play called selling of peares , or how many plums for a penie ; p. 299 , {~ GREEK SMALL LETTER CHI ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER NU ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER NU ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA ~}, a kinde of playe called Clowt , clowt , To beare about , or my hen hath layd ; {~ GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER PI ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER MU ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA ~}, a kind of sport or play with an oister shell or a stone throwne into the water , and making circles yer it sinke , &amp; c .; it is called , A ducke and a drake , And a halfe penie cake . ” This last notice is particularly curious , for similar verses are used by boys at the present day at the game of water-skimming . The amusement itself is very ancient , and a description of it may be seen in Minucius Felix , Lugd . Bat .<date>1652</date>, p. 3 . There cannot be a doubt but that many of the inexplicable nonsense-rhymes of our nursery belonged to antique recreations , but it is very seldom their original application can be recovered . The well-known doggerel respecting the tailor of Bicester may be mentioned as a remarkable instance of this , for it is one of the most common nursery-rhymes of the present day , and Aubrey , MS. Lansd . 231 , writing in the latter part of the seventeenth century , preserved it as part of the formula of a game called leap-candle . “ The young girls in and about<settlement>Oxford</settlement>have a sport called Leap-Candle , for which they set a candle in the middle of the room in a candlestick , and then draw up their coats into the form of breaches , and dance over the candle back and forth , with these words : The tailor of Biciter , He has but one eye , He cannot cut a pair of green galagaskins , If he were to die . This sport in other parts is called Dancing the Candle Rush . ” It may be necessary to observe that galagaskins were wide loose trousers . The rhyme of Jack Horner has been stated to be a satire on the Puritanical aversion to Christmas pies and suchlike abominations . It forms part of a metrical chap-book history , founded on the same story as the Friar and the Boy , entitled “ The Pleasant History of Jack Horner , containing his witty tricks , and pleasant pranks , which he played from his youth to his riper years : right pleasant and delightful for winter and summer 's recreation , ” embellished with frightful woodcuts , which have not much connexion with the tale . The pleasant history commences as follows : Jack Horner was a pretty lad , Near<settlement>London</settlement>he did dwell , His father 's heart he made full glad , His mother lov 'd him well . While little Jack was sweet and young , If he by chance should cry , His mother pretty sonnets sung , With a lul-la-ba-by , With such a dainty curious tone , As Jack sat on her knee , So that , e'er he could go alone , He sung as well as she . A pretty boy of curious wit , All people spoke his praise , And in the corner would he sit In Christmas holydays . When friends they did together meet , To pass away the time — Why , little Jack , he sure would eat His Christmas pie in rhyme . And said , Jack Horner , in the corner , Eats good Christmas pie , And with his thumbs pulls out the plumbs , And said , Good boy am I ! Here we have an important discovery ! Who before suspected that the nursery-rhyme was written by Jack Horner himself ? Few children 's rhymes are more common than those relating to Jack Sprat and his wife , “ Jack Sprat could eat no fat , ” &amp; c .; but it is little thought they have been current for two centuries . Such , however , is the fact , and when Howell published his collection of Proverbs in<date>1659</date>, p. 20 , the story related to no less exalted a personage than an archdeacon : Archdeacon Pratt would eat no fatt , His wife would eat no lean ; ‘ Twixt Archdeacon Pratt and Joan his wife , The meat was eat up clean . On the same page of this collection we find the commencement of the rigmarole , “ A man of words and not of deeds , ” which in the next century was converted into a burlesque song on the battle of Culloden !<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>Double Dee Double Day , Set a garden full of seeds ; When the seeds began to grow , It 's like a garden full of snow . When the snow began to melt , Like a ship without a belt . When the ship began to sail , Like a bird without a tail . When the bird began to fly , Like an eagle in the sky . When the sky began to roar , Like a lion at the door . When the door began to crack , Like a stick laid o'er my back . When my back began to smart , Like a penknife in my heart . When my heart began to bleed , Like a needleful of thread . When the thread began to rot , Like a turnip in the pot . When the pot began to boil , Like a bottle full of oil . When the oil began to settle , Like our Geordies bloody battle . [ Footnote 10 : The following nursery game , played by two girls , one personating the mistress and the other a servant , was obtained from Yorkshire , and may be interpreted as a dialogue between a lady and her Jacobite maid : Lady . Jenny , come here ! So I hear you have been to see that man . Maid . What man , madam ? Lady . Why , the handsome man . Maid . Why , madam , as I was a-passing by , Thinking no harm , no not in the least , not I , I did go in , But had no ill intention in the thing , For , as folks say , a cat may look at a king . Lady . A king do you call him ? You rebellious slut ! Maid . I did not call him so , dear lady , but — Lady . But me none of your buttings , for not another day Shall any rebel in my service stay ; I owe you twenty shillings — there 's a guinea ! Go , pack your clothes , and get about your business , Jenny . ] The earliest copy of the saying , “ A man of words and not of deeds , ” I have hitherto met with , occurs in MS. Harl .<date>1927</date>, of the time of James I . Another version , written towards the close of the seventeenth century , but unfitted for publication , is preserved on the last leaf of MS. Harl . 6580 . Many of the metrical nonsense-riddles of the nursery are of considerable antiquity . A collection of conundrums formed early in the seventeenth century by Randle Holmes , the Chester antiquary , and now preserved in MS. Harl .<date>1962</date>, contains several which have been traditionally remembered up to the present day . Thus we find versions of “ Little Nancy Etticoat in a white petticoat , ” “ Two legs sat upon three legs , ” “ As round as an apple , ” and others .<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>[ Footnote 11 : A vast number of these kind of rhymes have become obsolete , and old manuscripts contain many not very intelligible . Take the following as a specimen : Ruste duste tarbotell , Bagpipelorum hybattell .— MS . Harl . 7332 , xvij . cent . ] During the latter portion of the seventeenth century numerous songs and games were introduced which were long remembered in the English nursery . “ Questions and Commands ” was a common game , played under various systems of representation . One boy would enact king , and the subjects would give burlesque answers , e. g .: K. King I am ! S. I am your man . K. What service will you do ? S. The best and worst , and all I can ! A clever writer in the Gentleman 's Magazine for<date>1738</date>, says this was played during the Commonwealth in ridicule of sovereignty ! He humorously adds , continually quoting games then current : “ During all Oliver 's time , the chief diversion was , ‘ The parson hath lost his fuddling-cap , ’ which needs no explanation . At the Restoration succeeded love-games , as ‘ I love my love with an A , ’ a ‘ Flower and a lady , ’ and ‘ I am a lusty wooer ; ’ changed in the latter end of this reign , as well as all King James II . ' s , to ‘ I am come to torment you . ’ At the Revolution , when all people recovered their liberty , the children played promiscuously at what game they liked best . The most favorite one , however , was ‘ Puss in the corner . ’ ” The same writer also mentions the game of “ I am a Spanish merchant . ” The following nursery-rhyme is quoted in Parkin 's Reply to Dr. Stukeley 's second number of the Origines Roystonianae , 4to .<date>1748</date>, p. 6 , but I am not aware that it is still current :— Peter White will ne'er go right , And would you know the reason why ? He follows his nose where'er he goes , And that stands all awry . The tale of “ Old Mother Hubbard ” is undoubtedly of some antiquity , were we merely to judge of the rhyme of laughing to coffin in the third verse .<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>“ There was an old woman toss 'd up in a blanket ” is supposed to be the original song of “ Lilliburlero , or Old Woman , whither so high ? ” the tune to which was published in<date>1678</date>.<span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>“ Come , drink old ale with me , ” a nursery catch , with an improper meaning now lost , is found in MS. Harl . 7332 , of the seventeenth century . “ Round about , round about , magotty-pie , ” is probably as old , magot-pie being an obsolete term for a magpie . For a similar reason , the antiquity of “ Here am I , little Jumping Joan , ” may be inferred . Jumping Joan was the Cant term for a lady of little reputation .<span type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>The well-known riddle , “ As I was going to St. Ives , ” occurs in MS. Harl . 7316 , of the early part of the last century ; and the following extract from Poor Robin 's Almanack for<date>1693</date>, may furnish us with the original of the celebrated ballad on Tom of Islington , though the latter buried his troublesome wife on Sunday : “ How one saw a lady on the Saturday , married her on the Sunday , she was brought to bed on the Monday , the child christened on the Tuesday , it died on the Wednesday , was buried on the Thursday , the bride 's portion was paid on the Friday , and the bridegroom ran clear away on the Saturday ! ” [ Footnote 12 : The first three verses are all the original . The rest is modern , and was added when Mother Hubbard was the first of a series of eighteen-penny books published by Harris . ] [ Footnote 13 : Chappell 's National Airs , p . 89 . ] [ Footnote 14 : Beaumont and Fletcher , ed . Dyce , viii . 176 . The tune of Jumping Joan is mentioned in MS. Harl . 7316 , p . 67 . ] The antiquity of a rhyme is not unfrequently determined by the use of an obsolete expression . Thus it may be safely concluded that the common nursery address to the white moth is no modern composition , from the use of the term dustipoll , a very old nickname for a miller , which has long fallen into disuse : Millery , millery , dustipoll , How many sacks have you stole ? Four and twenty and a peck : Hang the miller up by his neck ! The expression is used by Robin Goodfellow in the old play of Grim , the Collier of Croydon , first printed in<date>1662</date>, but written considerably before that period : Now , miller , miller , dustipole , I 'll clapper-claw your jobbernole !<span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>[ Footnote 15 : “ Oh , madam , I will give you the keys of Canterbury , ” must be a very ancient song , as it mentions chopines , or high cork shoes , and appears , from another passage , to have been written before the invention of bell-pulls . The obsolete term delve , to dig , exhibits the antiquity of the rhyme “ One , two , buckle my shoe . ” Minikin occurs in a rhyme printed in the Nursery Rhymes of<country>England</country>, p. 145 ; coif , ibid . p. 150 ; snaps , small fragments , ibid . p. 190 ; moppet , a little pet , ibid . p. 193 , &amp; c .] A very curious ballad , written about the year<date>1720</date>, in the possession of Mr. Crofton Croker , establishes the antiquity of the rhymes of “ Jack-a-Dandy , ” “ Boys and girls come out to play , ” “ Tom Tidler 's on the Friar 's ground , ” “<settlement>London</settlement>bridge is broken down , ” “ Who comes here , a grenadier , ” and “ See , saw , sacradown , ” besides mentioning others we have before alluded to . The ballad is entitled , “ Namby Pamby , or a Panegyric on the New Versification , addressed to A. F ., Esq . ” Nanty Panty , Jack-a-Dandy , Stole a piece of sugar-candy , From the grocer 's shoppy shop , And away did hoppy hop .</docImprint>

Now he sings of Jacky Horner , Sitting in the chimney corner , Eating of a Christmas pie , Putting in his thumb , oh ! fie ! Putting in , oh ! fie , his thumb , Pulling out , oh ! strange , a plumb ! Now he acts the grenadier , Calling for a pot of beer : Where 's his money ? He 's forgot — Get him gone , a drunken sot ! Now on cock-horse does he ride , And anon on timber stride , Se and saw , and sack'ry down ,<settlement>London</settlement>is a gallant town ! [ Footnote 16 : Namby Pamby is said to have been a nickname for Ambrose Phillips . Another ballad , written about the same time as the above , alludes to the rhyme of “ Goosy Goosy , Gander . ” ] This ballad is a very important illustration of the history of these puerile rhymes , for it establishes the fact that some we might aptly consider modern are at least more than a century old ; and who would have thought such nonsense as , Who comes here ? A grenadier ! What do you want ? A pot of beer ! Where 's your money ? I 've forgot ! Get you gone , You drunken sot ! could have descended in all its purity for several generations , even although it really may have a deep meaning and an unexceptionable moral ? Having thus , I trust , shown that the nursery has an archaeology , the study of which may eventually lead to important results , the jingles and songs of our childhood are defended from the imputation of exclusive frivolity . We may hope that , henceforth , those who have the opportunity will not consider it a derogatory task to add to these memorials . But they must hasten to the rescue . The antiquities of the people are rapidly disappearing before the spread of education ; and before many years have elapsed , they will be lost , or recorded only in the collections of the antiquary , perhaps requiring evidence that they ever existed . This is the latest period at which there is a chance of our arresting their disappearance . If , unfortunately , the most valuable relics of this kind are wholly lost , many , doubtlessly , remain in the remote districts sufficiently curious to reward the collector ; and it is to be hoped they will not be allowed to share the fate of Wade and his boat Guingelot .</docImprint>

   <head>II .— FIRESIDE NURSERY STORIES .</head>
   <p>The efforts of modern romance are so greatly superior to the best fictions of a former age , that old wives ’ tales are not so readily tolerated as they were in times past . We question whether any one in these days , save a very grave antiquary , could read two chapters of the Morte Arthure without a yawn . Let us , then , turn to that simpler class of narratives which bears the same relation to novels that rural ballads do to the poem ; and ascertain whether the wild interest which , in the primitive tales erewhile taught by nurse , first awakened our imagination , can be so reflected as to render their resuscitation agreeable . We rely a good deal for the success of the experiment on the power of association ; for though these inventions may , in their character , be suited to the dawn of intellect , they not infrequently bear the impress of creative fancy , and their imperceptible influence over the mind does not always evaporate at a later age .</p>
   <p>Few persons , indeed , there are , even amongst those who affect to be insignificantly touched by the imagination , who can be recalled to the stories and carols that charmed them in their childhood wholly without emotion . An affectation of indifference in such matters is , of course , not unusual , for most thoughts springing from early associations , and those on which so many minds love to dwell , may not be indiscriminately divulged . It is impossible they should be generally appreciated or understood . Most of us , however , are liable to be occasionally touched by allusions breathing of happy days , bearing our memories downward to behold the shadows of joys that have long passed away like a dream . They now serve only “ to mellow our occasions , ” like that “ old and antique song ” which relieved the passion of the Duke Orsino .</p>
   <p>TEENY-TINY .</p>
   <note>This simple tale seldom fails to rivet the attention of children , especially if well told . The last two words should be said loudly with a start . It was obtained from oral tradition , and has not , I believe , been printed .</note>
   <p>Once upon a time there was a teeny-tiny woman lived in a teeny-tiny house in a teeny-tiny village . Now , one day this teeny-tiny woman put on her teeny-tiny bonnet , and went out of her teeny-tiny house to take a teeny-tiny walk . And when this teeny-tiny woman had gone a teeny-tiny way , she came to a teeny-tiny gate ; so the teeny-tiny woman opened the teeny-tiny gate , and went into a teeny-tiny churchyard . And when this teeny-tiny woman had got into the teeny-tiny churchyard , she saw a teeny-tiny bone on a teeny-tiny grave , and the teeny-tiny woman said to her teeny-tiny self , “ This teeny-tiny bone will make me some teeny-tiny soup for my teeny-tiny supper . ” So the teeny-tiny woman put the teeny-tiny bone into her teeny-tiny pocket , and went home to her teeny-tiny house .</p>
   <p>Now when the teeny-tiny woman got home to her teeny-tiny house , she was a teeny-tiny tired ; so she went up her teeny-tiny stairs to her teeny-tiny bed , and put the teeny-tiny bone into a teeny-tiny cupboard . And when this teeny-tiny woman had been to sleep a teeny-tiny time , she was awakened by a teeny-tiny voice from the teeny-tiny cupboard , which said , “ Give me my bone ! ” And this teeny-tiny woman was a teeny-tiny frightened , so she hid her teeny-tiny head under the teeny-tiny clothes , and went to sleep again . And when she had been to sleep again a teeny-tiny time , the teeny-tiny voice again cried out from the teeny-tiny cupboard a teeny-tiny louder , “ Give me my bone ! ” This made the teeny-tiny woman a teeny-tiny more frightened , so she hid her teeny-tiny head a teeny-tiny further under the teeny-tiny clothes . And when the teeny-tiny woman had been to sleep again a teeny-tiny time , the teeny-tiny voice from the teeny-tiny cupboard said again a teeny-tiny louder , “ Give me my bone ! ” And this teeny-tiny woman was a teeny-tiny bit more frightened , but she put her teeny-tiny head out of the teeny-tiny clothes , and said in her loudest teeny-tiny voice , “ Take it ! ”</p>
   <p>THE STORY OF MR. VINEGAR .</p>
   <note>This story was obtained from oral tradition in the West of England . It is undoubtedly a variation of the “ Hans im Glueck ” of Grimm , which is current in Germany .</note>
   <p>Mr. and Mrs. Vinegar lived in a vinegar bottle . Now one day , when Mr. Vinegar was from home , Mrs. Vinegar , who was a very good housewife , was busily sweeping her house , when an unlucky thump of the broom brought the whole house clitter-clatter , clitter-clatter , about her ears . In a paroxysm of grief she rushed forth to meet her husband . On seeing him she exclaimed , “ Oh , Mr. Vinegar , Mr. Vinegar , we are ruined , we are ruined : I have knocked the house down , and it is all to pieces ! ” Mr. Vinegar then said , “ My dear , let us see what can be done . Here is the door ; I will take it on my back , and we will go forth to seek our fortune . ” They walked all that day , and at nightfall entered a thick forest . They were both excessively tired , and Mr. Vinegar said , “ My love , I will climb up into a tree , drag up the door , and you shall follow . ” He accordingly did so , and they both stretched their weary limbs on the door , and fell fast asleep . In the middle of the night Mr. Vinegar was disturbed by the sound of voices beneath , and to his inexpressible dismay perceived that a party of thieves were met to divide their booty . “ Here , Jack , ” said one , “ here 's five pounds for you ; here , Bill , here 's ten pounds for you ; here , Bob , here 's three pounds for you . ” Mr. Vinegar could listen no longer ; his terror was so intense that he trembled most violently , and shook down the door on their heads . Away scampered the thieves , but Mr. Vinegar dared not quit his retreat till broad daylight . He then scrambled out of the tree , and went to lift up the door . What did he behold but a number of golden guineas ! “ Come down , Mrs. Vinegar , ” he cried , “ come down , I say ; our fortune 's made , our fortune 's made ! come down , I say . ” Mrs. Vinegar got down as fast as she could , and saw the money with equal delight . “ Now , my dear , ” said she , “ I 'll tell you what you shall do . There is a fair at the neighbouring town ; you shall take these forty guineas and buy a cow . I can make butter and cheese , which you shall sell at market , and we shall then be able to live very comfortably . ” Mr. Vinegar joyfully assents , takes the money , and goes off to the fair . When he arrived , he walked up and down , and at length saw a beautiful red cow . It was an excellent milker , and perfect in every respect . Oh ! thought Mr. Vinegar , if I had but that cow I should be the happiest man alive ; so he offers the forty guineas for the cow , and the owner declaring that , as he was a friend , he 'd oblige him , the bargain was made . Proud of his purchase , he drove the cow backwards and forwards to show it . By-and-by he saw a man playing the bagpipes , Tweedle dum , tweedle dee ; the children followed him about , and he appeared to be pocketing money on all sides . Well , thought Mr. Vinegar , if I had but that beautiful instrument I should be the happiest man alive — my fortune would be made . So he went up to the man , “ Friend , ” says he , “ what a beautiful instrument that is , and what a deal of money you must make . ” “ Why , yes , ” said the man , “ I make a great deal of money , to be sure , and it is a wonderful instrument . ” “ Oh ! ” cried Mr. Vinegar , “ how I should like to possess it ! ” “ Well , ” said the man , “ as you are a friend , I do n't much mind parting with it ; you shall have it for that red cow . ” “ Done , ” said the delighted Mr. Vinegar ; so the beautiful red cow was given for the bagpipes . He walked up and down with his purchase , but in vain he attempted to play a tune , and instead of pocketing pence , the boys followed him hooting , laughing , and pelting . Poor Mr. Vinegar , his fingers grew very cold , and , heartily ashamed and mortified , he was leaving the town , when he met a man with a fine thick pair of gloves . “ Oh , my fingers are so very cold , ” said Mr. Vinegar to himself ; “ if I had but those beautiful gloves I should be the happiest man alive . ” He went up to the man , and said to him , “ Friend , you seem to have a capital pair of gloves there . ” “ Yes , truly , ” cried the man ; “ and my hands are as warm as possible this cold November day . ” “ Well , ” said Mr. Vinegar , “ I should like to have them . ” “ What will you give ? ” said the man ; “ as you are a friend , I do n't much mind letting you have them for those bagpipes . ” “ Done , ” cried Mr. Vinegar . He put on the gloves , and felt perfectly happy as he trudged homewards . At last he grew very tired , when he saw a man coming towards him with a good stout stick in his hand . “ Oh , ” said Mr. Vinegar , “ that I had but that stick ! I should then be the happiest man alive . ” He accosted the man — “ Friend ! what a rare good stick you have got . ” “ Yes , ” said the man , “ I have used it for many a long mile , and a good friend it has been , but if you have a fancy for it , as you are a friend , I do n't mind giving it to you for that pair of gloves . ” Mr. Vinegar 's hands were so warm , and his legs so tired , that he gladly exchanged . As he drew near to the wood where he had left his wife , he heard a parrot on a tree calling out his name — “ Mr. Vinegar , you foolish man , you blockhead , you simpleton ; you went to the fair , and laid out all your money in buying a cow ; not content with that , you changed it for bagpipes , on which you could not play , and which were not worth one tenth of the money . You fool , you — you had no sooner got the bagpipes than you changed them for the gloves , which were not worth one quarter of the money ; and when you had got the gloves , you changed them for a poor miserable stick ; and now for your forty guineas , cow , bagpipes , and gloves , you have nothing to show but that poor miserable stick , which you might have cut in any hedge . ” On this the bird laughed immoderately , and Mr. Vinegar , falling into a violent rage , threw the stick at its head . The stick lodged in the tree , and he returned to his wife without money , cow , bagpipes , gloves , or stick , and she instantly gave him such a sound cudgelling that she almost broke every bone in his skin .</p>

   <p>As Chicken-licken went one day to the wood , an acorn fell upon her poor bald pate , and she thought the sky had fallen . So she said she would go and tell the king that the sky had fallen . So chicken-licken turned back , and met Hen-len . “ Well , hen-len , where are you going ? ” And hen-len said , “ I 'm going to the wood for some meat . ” And chicken-licken said , “ Oh ! hen-len , do n't go , for I was going , and the sky fell upon my poor bald pate , and I 'm going to tell the king . ” So hen-len turned back with chicken-licken , and met Cock-lock . “ Oh ! cock-lock , where are you going ? ” And cock-lock said , “ I 'm going to the wood for some meat . ” Then hen-len said , “ Oh ! cock-lock , do n't go , for I was going , and I met chicken-licken , and chicken-licken had been at the wood , and the sky had fallen on her poor bald pate , and we are going to tell the king . ”</p>
   <p>So cock-lock turned back , and met Duck-luck . “ Well , duck-luck , where are you going ? ” And duck-luck said , “ I 'm going to the wood for some meat . ” Then cock-lock said , “ Oh ! duck-luck , do n't go , for I was going , and I met hen-len , and hen-len met chicken-licken , and chicken-licken had been at the wood , and the sky had fallen on her poor bald pate , and we are going to tell the king . ”</p>
   <p>So duck-luck turned back , and met Drake-lake . “ Well , drake-lake , where are you going ? ” And drake-lake said , “ I 'm going to the wood for some meat . ” Then duck-luck said , “ Oh ! drake-lake , do n't go , for I was going , and I met cock-lock , and cock-lock met hen-len , and hen-len met chicken-licken , and chicken-licken had been at the wood , and the sky had fallen on her poor bald pate , and we are going to tell the king . ”</p>
   <p>So drake-lake turned back , and met Goose-loose . “ Well , goose-loose , where are you going ? ” And goose-loose said , “ I 'm going to the wood for some meat . ” Then drake-lake said , “ Oh ! goose-loose , do n't go , for I was going , and I met duck-luck , and duck-luck met cock-lock , and cock-lock met hen-len , and hen-len met chicken-licken , and chicken-licken had been at the wood , and the sky had fallen on her poor bald pate , and we are going to tell the king . ”</p>
   <p>So goose-loose turned back , and met Gander-lander . “ Well , gander-lander , where are you going ? ” And gander-lander said , “ I 'm going to the wood for some meat . ” Then goose-loose said , “ Oh ! gander-lander , do n't go , for I was going , and I met drake-lake , and drake-lake met duck-luck , and duck-luck met cock-lock , and cock-lock met hen-len , and hen-len met chicken-licken , and chicken-licken had been at the wood , and the sky had fallen on her poor bald pate , and we are going to tell the king . ”</p>
   <p>So gander-lander turned back , and met Turkey-lurkey . “ Well , turkey-lurkey , where are you going ? ” And turkey-lurkey said , “ I 'm going to the wood for some meat . ” Then gander-lander said , “ Oh ! turkey-lurkey , do n't go , for I was going , and I met goose-loose , and goose-loose met drake-lake , and drake-lake met duck-luck , and duck-luck met cock-lock , and cock-lock met hen-len , and hen-len met chicken-licken , and chicken-licken had been at the wood , and the sky had fallen on her poor bald pate , and we are going to tell the king . ”</p>
   <p>So turkey-lurkey turned back , and walked with gander-lander , goose-loose , drake-lake , duck-luck , cock-lock , hen-len , and chicken-licken . And as they were going along , they met Fox-lox . And fox-lox said , “ Where are you going , my pretty maids ? ” And they said , “ Chicken-licken went to the wood , and the sky fell upon her poor bald pate , and we are going to tell the king . ” And fox-lox said , “ Come along with me , and I will show you the way . ” But fox-lox took them into the fox 's hole , and he and his young ones soon ate up poor chicken-licken , hen-len , cock-lock , duck-luck , drake-lake , goose-loose , gander-lander , and turkey-lurkey , and they never saw the king , to tell him that the sky had fallen !</p>

    <head>THE MISER AND HIS WIFE .</head>
    <head>[ “ Let us cast away nothing , ” says Mr. Gifford , “ for we know not what use we may have for it . ” So will every one admit whose reading has been sufficiently extensive to enable him to judge of the value of the simplest traditional tales . The present illustrates a passage in Ben Jonson in a very remarkable manner ,—</head>
     <l n="1">—— Say we are robb 'd ,</l>
     <l n="2">If any come to borrow a spoon or so ;</l>
     <l n="3">I will not have Good Fortune or God 's Blessing</l>
     <l n="4">Let in , while I am busy . ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Once upon a time there was an old miser , who lived with his wife near a great town , and used to put by every bit of money he could lay his hands on . His wife was a simple woman , and they lived together without quarrelling , but she was obliged to put up with very hard fare . Now , sometimes , when there was a sixpence she thought might be spared for a comfortable dinner or supper , she used to ask the miser for it , but he would say , “ No , wife , it must be put by for Good Fortune . ” It was the same with every penny he could get hold of , and notwithstanding all she could say , almost every coin that came into the house was put by “ for Good Fortune . ”</p>
   <p>The miser said this so often , that some of his neighbours heard him , and one of them thought of a trick by which he might get the money . So the first day that the old chuff was away from home , he dressed himself like a wayfaring man , and knocked at the door . “ Who are you ? ” said the wife . He answered , “ I am Good Fortune , and I am come for the money which your husband has laid by for me . ” So this simple woman , not suspecting any trickery , readily gave it to him , and , when her good man came home , told him very pleasantly that Good Fortune had called for the money which had been kept so long for him .</p>
   <p>THE THREE QUESTIONS .</p>
   <p>There lived formerly in the county of Cumberland a nobleman who had three sons , two of whom were comely and clever youths , but the other a natural fool , named Jack , who was generally dressed in a party-coloured coat , and a steeple-crowned hat with a tassel , as became his condition . Now the King of the East Angles had a beautiful daughter , who was distinguished by her great ingenuity and wit , and he issued a decree that whoever should answer three questions put to him by the princess should have her in marriage , and be heir to the crown at his decease . Shortly after this decree was published , news of it reached the ears of the nobleman 's sons , and the two clever ones determined to have a trial , but they were sadly at a loss to prevent their idiot brother from going with them . They could not , by any means , get rid of him , and were compelled at length to let Jack accompany them . They had not gone far , before Jack shrieked with laughter , saying , “ I 've found an egg . ” “ Put it in your pocket , ” said the brothers . A little while afterwards , he burst out into another fit of laughter on finding a crooked hazel stick , which he also put in his pocket : and a third time , he again laughed extravagantly because he found a nut . That also was put with his other treasures .</p>
   <p>When they arrived at the palace , they were immediately admitted on mentioning the nature of their business , and were ushered into a room where the princess and her suite were sitting . Jack , who never stood on ceremony , bawled out , “ What a troop of fair ladies we 've got here ! ” “ Yes , ” said the princess , “ we are fair ladies , for we carry fire in our bosoms . ” “ Do you , ” said Jack , “ then roast me an egg , ” pulling out the egg from his pocket . “ How will you get it out again ? ” said the princess . “ With a crooked stick , ” replied Jack , producing the hazel . “ Where did that come from ? ” said the princess . “ From a nut , ” answered Jack , pulling out the nut from his pocket . And thus the “ fool of the family , ” having been the first to answer the questions of the princess , was married to her the next day , and ultimately succeeded to the throne .</p>

   <p>THE PRINCESS OF CANTERBURY .</p>
   <p>In days of yore , when this country was governed by several sovereigns , amongst them was the King of Canterbury , who had an only daughter , wise , fair , and beautiful . She was unmarried , and according to a custom not unusual in those days , of assigning an arbitrary action for the present of a lady 's hand , the king issued a proclamation that whoever would watch one night with his daughter , and neither sleep nor doze , should have her the next day in marriage ; but if he did either , he should lose his head . Many knights attempted to fulfil the condition , and , having failed in the attempt , forfeited their lives .</p>
   <p>Now it happened that a young shepherd , grazing his flock near the road , said to his master , “ Zur ,<span corresp="#note17" type="note_anchor">[ 17 ]</span>I zee many gentlemen ride to the court at Canterbury , but I ne'er zee ‘ em return again . ” “ O , shepherd , ” said his master , “ I know not how you should , for they attempt to watch with the king 's daughter , according to the decree , and not performing it , they are all beheaded . ” “ Well , ” said the shepherd , “ I 'll try my vorton ; zo now vor a king 's daughter , or a headless shepherd ! ” And taking his bottle and bag , he trudged to the court . In his way thither , he was obliged to cross a river , and pulling off his shoes and stockings , while he was passing over he observed several pretty fish bobbing against his feet ; so he caught some , and put them into his pocket . When he reached the palace , he knocked at the gate loudly with his crook , and having mentioned the object of his visit , he was immediately conducted to a hall , where the king 's daughter sat ready prepared to receive her lovers . He was placed in a luxurious chair , and rich wines and spices were set before him , and all sorts of delicate meats . The shepherd , unused to such fare , eat and drank plentifully , so that he was nearly dozing before midnight . “ O shepherd , ” said the lady , “ I have caught you napping ! ” “ Noa , sweet ally , I was busy a-feeshing . ” “ A-fishing ! ” said the princess in the utmost astonishment : “ Nay , shepherd , there is no fish-pond in the hall . ” “ No matter vor that , I have been feeshing in my pocket , and have just caught one . ” “ Oh me ! ” said she , “ let me see it . ” The shepherd slily drew the fish out of his pocket , and pretending to have caught it , showed it her , and she declared it was the finest she ever saw . About half an hour afterwards , she said , “ Shepherd , do you think you could get me one more ? ” He replied , “ Mayhap I may , when I have baited my hook ; ” and after a little while he brought out another , which was finer than the first , and the princess was so delighted that she gave him leave to go to sleep , and promised to excuse him to her father .</p>

   <p>In the morning the princess told the king , to his great astonishment , that the shepherd must not be beheaded , for he had been fishing in the hall all night ; but when he heard how the shepherd had caught such beautiful fish out of his pocket , he asked him to catch one in his own . The shepherd readily undertook the task , and bidding the king lie down , he pretended to fish in his pocket , having another fish concealed ready in his hand , and giving him a sly prick with a needle , he held up the fish , and showed it to the king . His majesty did not much relish the operation , but he assented to the marvel of it , and the princess and shepherd were united the same day , and lived for many years in happiness and prosperity .</p>

    <head>LAZY JACK .</head>
     <l n="1">[ From oral tradition in Yorkshire . ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Once upon a time there was a boy whose name was Jack , and he lived with his mother on a dreary common . They were very poor , and the old woman got her living by spinning , but Jack was so lazy that he would do nothing but bask in the sun in the hot weather , and sit by the corner of the hearth in the winter time . His mother could not persuade him to do anything for her , and was obliged at last to tell him that if he did not begin to work for his porridge , she would turn him out to get his living as he could .</p>
   <p>This threat at length roused Jack , and he went out and hired himself for the day to a neighbouring farmer for a penny ; but as he was coming home , never having had any money in his possession before , he lost it in passing over a brook . “ You stupid boy , ” said his mother , “ you should have put it in your pocket . ” “ I 'll do so another time , ” replied Jack .</p>
   <p>The next day Jack went out again , and hired himself to a cowkeeper , who gave him a jar of milk for his day 's work . Jack took the jar and put it into the large pocket of his jacket , spilling it all , long before he got home . “ Dear me ! ” said the old woman ; “ you should have carried it on your head . ” “ I 'll do so another time , ” replied Jack .</p>
   <p>The following day Jack hired himself again to a farmer , who agreed to give him a cream cheese for his services . In the evening , Jack took the cheese , and went home with it on his head . By the time he got home the cheese was completely spoilt , part of it being lost , and part matted with his hair . “ You stupid lout , ” said his mother , “ you should have carried it very carefully in your hands . ” “ I 'll do so another time , ” replied Jack .</p>
   <p>The day after this Jack again went out , and hired himself to a baker , who would give him nothing for his work but a large tom-cat . Jack took the cat , and began carrying it very carefully in his hands , but in a short time Pussy scratched him so much that he was compelled to let it go . When he got home , his mother said to him , “ You silly fellow , you should have tied it with a string , and dragged it along after you . ” “ I 'll do so another time , ” said Jack .</p>
   <p>The next day Jack hired himself to a butcher , who rewarded his labours by the handsome present of a shoulder of mutton . Jack took the mutton , tied it to a string , and trailed it along after him in the dirt , so that by the time he had got home the meat was completely spoilt . His mother was this time quite out of patience with him , for the next day was Sunday , and she was obliged to content herself with cabbage for her dinner . “ You ninnyhammer , ” said she to her son , “ you should have carried it on your shoulder . ” “ I 'll do so another time , ” replied Jack .</p>
   <p>On the Monday Jack went once more , and hired himself to a cattle-keeper , who gave him a donkey for his trouble . Although Jack was very strong , he found some difficulty in hoisting the donkey on his shoulders , but at last he accomplished it , and began walking slowly home with his prize . Now it happened that in the course of his journey there lived a rich man with his only daughter , a beautiful girl , but unfortunately deaf and dumb ; she had never laughed in her life , and the doctors said she would never recover till somebody made her laugh .<span corresp="#note18" type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span>Many tried without success , and at last the father , in despair , offered her in marriage to the first man who could make her laugh . This young lady happened to be looking out of the window when Jack was passing with the donkey on his shoulders , the legs sticking up in the air , and the sight was so comical and strange , that she burst out into a great fit of laughter , and immediately recovered her speech and hearing . Her father was overjoyed , and fulfilled his promise by marrying her to Jack , who was thus made a rich gentleman . They lived in a large house , and Jack 's mother lived with them in great happiness until she died .</p>

   <p>THE THREE HEADS OF THE WELL .</p>
   <note>This story is abridged from the old chap-book of the Three Kings of Colchester . The incident of the heads rising out of the well is very similar to one introduced in Peele 's Old Wives Tale , 1595 , and the verse is also of a similar character .</note>
   <p>Long before Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table , there reigned in the eastern part of England a king who kept his court at Colchester . He was witty , strong , and valiant , by which means he subdued his enemies abroad , and secured peace among his subjects at home . Nevertheless , in the midst of his glory , his queen died , leaving behind her an only daughter , about fifteen years of age . This lady , from her courtly carriage , beauty , and affability , was the wonder of all that knew her ; but , as covetousness is said to be the root of all evil , so it happened in this instance . The king hearing of a lady who had likewise an only daughter , for the sake of her riches had a mind to marry ; though she was old , ugly , hook-nosed , and humpbacked , yet all this could not deter him from marrying her . Her daughter , also , was a yellow dowdy , full of envy and ill-nature ; and , in short , was much of the same mould as her mother . This signified nothing , for in a few weeks the king , attended by the nobility and gentry , brought his intended bride to his palace , where the marriage rites were performed . They had not been long in the court before they set the king against his own beautiful daughter , which was done by false reports and accusations . The young princess , having lost her father 's love , grew weary of the court , and one day meeting with her father in the garden , she desired him , with tears in her eyes , to give her a small subsistence , and she would go and seek her fortune ; to which the king consented , and ordered her mother-in-law to make up a small sum according to her discretion . She went to the queen , who gave her a canvass bag of brown bread and hard cheese , with a bottle of beer ; though this was but a very pitiful dowry for a king 's daughter . She took it , returned thanks , and proceeded on her journey , passing through groves , woods , and valleys , till at length she saw an old man sitting on a stone at the mouth of a cave , who said , “ Good morrow , fair maiden , whither away so fast ? ” “ Aged father , ” says she , “ I am going to seek my fortune . ” “ What has thou in thy bag and bottle ? ” “ In my bag I have got bread and cheese , and in my bottle good small beer ; will you please to partake of either ? ” “ Yes , ” said he , “ with all my heart . ” With that the lady pulled out her provisions , and bid him eat and welcome . He did so , and gave her many thanks , saying thus : “ There is a thick thorny hedge before you , which will appear impassable , but take this wand in your hand , strike three times , and say , ‘ Pray , hedge , let me come through , ’ and it will open immediately ; then , a little further , you will find a well ; sit down on the brink of it , and there will come up three golden heads , which will speak : pray do whatever they require . ” Promising she would follow his directions , she took her leave of him . Arriving at the hedge , and pursuing the old man 's directions , it divided , and gave her a passage ; then , going to the well , she had no sooner sat down than a golden head came up singing —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Wash me , and comb me ,</l>
     <l n="2">And lay me down softly ,</l>
     <l n="3">And lay me on a bank to dry ,</l>
     <l n="4">That I may look pretty ,</l>
     <l n="5">When somebody comes by .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Yes , ” said she , and putting forth her hand , with a silver comb performed the office , placing it upon a primrose bank . Then came up a second and a third head , making the same request , which she complied with . She then pulled out her provisions and ate her dinner . Then said the heads one to another , “ What shall we do for this lady who hath used us so kindly ? ” The first said , “ I will cause such addition to her beauty as shall charm the most powerful prince in the world . ” The second said , “ I will endow her with such perfume , both in body and breath , as shall far exceed the sweetest flowers . ” The third said , “ My gift shall be none of the least , for , as she is a king 's daughter , I 'll make her so fortunate that she shall become queen to the greatest prince that reigns . ” This done , at their request she let them down into the well again , and so proceeded on her journey . She had not travelled long before she saw a king hunting in the park with his nobles ; she would have avoided him , but the king having caught a sight of her , approached , and what with her beauty and perfumed breath , was so powerfully smitten , that he was not able to subdue his passion , but commenced his courtship immediately , and was so successful that he gained her love , and , conducting her to his palace , he caused her to be clothed in the most magnificent manner .</p>
   <p>This being ended , and the king finding that she was the king of Colchester 's daughter , ordered some chariots to be got ready , that he might pay the king a visit . The chariot in which the king and queen rode was adorned with rich ornamental gems of gold . The king , her father , was at first astonished that his daughter had been so fortunate as she was , till the young king made him sensible of all that happened . Great was the joy at court amongst all , with the exception of the queen and her club-footed daughter , who were ready to burst with malice , and envied her happiness ; and the greater was their madness because she was now above them all . Great rejoicings , with feasting and dancing , continued many days . Then at length , with the dowry her father gave her they returned home .</p>
   <p>The deformed daughter perceiving that her sister had been so happy in seeking her fortune , would needs do the same ; so disclosing her mind to her mother , all preparations were made , and she was furnished not only with rich apparel , but sweetmeats , sugar , almonds , &amp; c ., in great quantities , and a large bottle of Malaga sack . Thus provided , she went the same road as her sister , and coming near the cave , the old man said , “ Young woman , whither so fast ? ” “ What is that to you , ” said she . “ Then , ” said he , “ what have you in your bag and bottle ? ” She answered , “ Good things , which you shall not be troubled with . ” “ Wo n't you give me some ? ” said he . “ No , not a bit , nor a drop , unless it would choke you . ” The old man frowned , saying , “ Evil fortune attend thee . ” Going on , she came to the hedge , through which she espied a gap , and thought to pass through it , but , going in , the hedge closed , and the thorns run into her flesh , so that it was with great difficulty that she got out . Being now in a painful condition , she searched for water to wash herself , and , looking round , she saw the well ; she sat down on the brink of it , and one of the heads came up , saying , “ Wash me , comb me , and lay me down softly , &amp; c . ” but she banged it with her bottle , saying , “ Take this for your washing . ” So the second and third heads came up , and met with no better treatment than the first ; whereupon the heads consulted among themselves what evils to plague her with for such usage . The first said , “ Let her be struck with leprosy in her face . ” The second , “ Let an additional smell be added to her breath . ” The third bestowed on her a husband , though but a poor country cobler . This done , she goes on till she came to a town , and it being market day , the people looked at her , and seeing such an evil face fled out of her sight , all but a poor cobler ( who not long before had mended the shoes of an old hermit , who having no money , gave him a box of ointment for the cure of the leprosy , and a bottle of spirits for a stinking breath ) . Now the cobler having a mind to do an act of charity , was induced to go up to her and ask her who she was . “ I am , ” said she , “ the king of Colchester 's daughter-in-law . ” “ Well , ” said the cobler , “ if I restore you to your natural complexion , and make a sound cure both in face and breath , will you in reward take me for a husband ? ” “ Yes , friend , ” replied she , “ with all my heart . ” With this the cobler applied the remedies , and they worked the effect in a few weeks , and then they were married , and after a few days they set forward for the court at Colchester . When the queen understood she had married a poor cobler , she fell into distraction , and hanged herself for vexation . The death of the queen was not a source of sorrow to the king , who had only married her for her fortune , and bore her no affection ; and shortly afterwards he gave the cobler a hundred pounds to take the daughter to a remote part of the kingdom , where he lived many years mending shoes , while his wife assisted the housekeeping by spinning , and selling the results of her labours at the country market .</p>
   <p>THE MAIDEN AND THE FROG .</p>
   <note>This tale of the frog-lover is known in every part of Germany , and is alluded to by several old writers of that country . It is the tale “ Der Froschkoenig , oder der Eiserne Heinrich , ” in Grimm . “ These enchanted frogs , ” says Sir W. Scott , “ have migrated from afar , and we suspect that they were originally crocodiles ; we trace them in a tale forming part of a series of stories entitled the Relations of Ssidi Kur , extant amongst the Calmuck Tartars . ” Mr . Chambers has given a Scotch version of the tale , under the title of “ The well o ’ the warld 's end , ” in his Popular Rhymes , p. 236 . The rhymes in the copy given above were obtained from the North of England , without , however , any reference to the story to which they evidently belong . The application , however , is so obvious to any one acquainted with the German and Scotch tale , that the framework I have ventured to give them cannot be considered incongruous ; although I need not add how very desirable it would be to procure the traditional tale as related by the English peasantry . Perhaps some of our readers may be enabled to supply it .</note>
   <p>Many years ago there lived on the brow of a mountain , in the North of England , an old woman and her daughter . They were very poor , and obliged to work very hard for their living , and the old woman 's temper was not very good , so that the maiden , who was very beautiful , led but an ill life with her . The girl , indeed , was compelled to do the hardest work , for her mother got their principal means of subsistence by travelling to places in the neighbourhood with small articles for sale , and when she came home in the afternoon she was not able to do much more work . Nearly the whole domestic labour of the cottage devolved therefore on the daughter , the most wearisome part of which consisted in the necessity of fetching all the water they required from a well on the other side of the hill , there being no river or spring near their own cottage .</p>
   <p>It happened one morning that the daughter had the misfortune , in going to the well , to break the only pitcher they possessed , and having no other utensil she could use for the purpose , she was obliged to go home without bringing any water . When her mother returned , she was unfortunately troubled with excessive thirst , and the girl , though trembling for the consequences of her misfortune , told her exactly the circumstance that had occurred . The old woman was furiously angry , and so far from making any allowances for her daughter , pointed to a sieve which happened to be on the table , and told her to go at once to the well and bring her some water in that , or never venture to appear again in her sight .</p>
   <p>The young maiden , frightened almost out of her wits by her mother 's fury , speedily took the sieve , and though she considered the task a hopeless one to accomplish , almost unconsciously hastened to the well . When she arrived there , beginning to reflect on the painful situation in which she was placed , and the utter impossibility of her obtaining a living by herself , she threw herself down on the brink of the well in an agony of despair . Whilst she was in this condition , a large frog came up to the top of the water , and asked her for what she was crying so bitterly . She was somewhat surprised at this , but not being the least frightened , told him the whole story , and that she was crying because she could not carry away water in the sieve . “ Is that all ? ” said the frog ; “ cheer up , my hinny ! for if you will only let me sleep with you for two nights , and then chop off my head , I will tell you how to do it . ” The maiden thought the frog could not be in earnest , but she was too impatient to consider much about it , and at once made the required promise . The frog then instructed her in the following words ,—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Stop with fog ( moss ) ,</l>
     <l n="2">And daub with clay ;</l>
     <l n="3">And that will carry</l>
     <l n="4">The water away .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Having said this , he dived immediately under the water , and the girl , having followed his advice , got the sieve full of water , and returned home with it , not thinking much of her promise to the frog . By the time she reached home the old woman 's wrath was appeased , but as they were eating their frugal supper very quietly , what should they hear but the splashing and croaking of a frog near the door , and shortly afterwards the daughter recognised the voice of the frog of the well saying ,—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Open the door , my hinny , my heart ,</l>
     <l n="2">Open the door , my own darling ;</l>
     <l n="3">Remember the words you spoke to me ,</l>
     <l n="4">In the meadow by the well-spring .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>She was now dreadfully frightened , and hurriedly explained the matter to her mother , who was also so much alarmed at the circumstance , that she dared not refuse admittance to the frog , who , when the door was opened , leapt into the room , exclaiming :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Go wi ’ me to bed , my hinny , my heart ,</l>
     <l n="2">Go wi ’ me to bed , my own darling ;</l>
     <l n="3">Remember the words you spoke to me ,</l>
     <l n="4">In the meadow by the well-spring .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This command was also obeyed , although , as may be readily supposed , she did not much relish such a bedfellow . The next day , the frog was very quiet , and evidently enjoyed the fare they placed before him ,— the purest milk and the finest bread they could procure . In fact , neither the old woman nor her daughter spared any pains to render the frog comfortable . That night , immediately supper was finished , the frog again exclaimed :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Go wi ’ me to bed , my hinny , my heart ,</l>
     <l n="2">Go wi ’ me to bed , my own darling ;</l>
     <l n="3">Remember the words you spoke to me ,</l>
     <l n="4">In the meadow by the well-spring .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">She again allowed the frog to share her couch , and in the morning , as</l>
     <l n="6">soon as she was dressed , he jumped towards her , saying :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">Chop off my head , my hinny , my heart ,</l>
     <l n="8">Chop off my head , my own darling ;</l>
     <l n="9">Remember the words you spoke to me ,</l>
     <l n="10">In the meadow by the well-spring .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The maiden had no sooner accomplished this last request , than in the stead of the frog there stood by her side the handsomest prince in the world , who had long been transformed by a magician , and who could never have recovered his natural shape until a beautiful virgin had consented , of her own accord , to make him her bedfellow for two nights . The joy of all parties was complete ; the girl and the prince were shortly afterwards married , and lived for many years in the enjoyment of every happiness .</p>
   <p>THE STORY OF MR. FOX .</p>
   <note>A simple , but very curious tale , of considerable antiquity . It is alluded to by Shakespeare , and was contributed to the variorum edition by Blakeway . Part of this story will recall to the reader 's memory the enchanted chamber of Britomart .</note>
   <p>Once upon a time there was a young lady called Lady Mary , who had two brothers . One summer they all three went to a country seat of theirs which they had not before visited . Among the other gentry in the neighbourhood who came to see them was a Mr. Fox , a bachelor , with whom they , particularly the young lady , were much pleased . He used often to dine with them , and frequently invited Lady Mary to come and see his house . One day , when her brothers were absent elsewhere , and she had nothing better to do , she determined to go thither , and accordingly set out unattended . When she arrived at the house and knocked at the door , no one answered . At length she opened it and went in , and over the portal of the door was written :</p>
   <p>Be bold , be bold , but not too bold .</p>
   <p>She advanced , and found the same inscription over the staircase ; again at the entrance of a gallery ; and lastly , at the door of a chamber , with the addition of a line :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Be bold , be bold , but not too bold ,</l>
     <l n="2">Lest that your heart 's blood should run cold !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>She opened it , and what was her terror and astonishment to find the floor covered with bones and blood . She retreated in haste , and coming down stairs , she saw from a window Mr. Fox advancing towards the house with a drawn sword in one hand , while with the other he dragged along a young lady by the hair of her head . Lady Mary had just time to slip down , and hide herself under the stairs , before Mr. Fox and his victim arrived at the foot of them . As he pulled the young lady upstairs , she caught hold of one of the bannisters with her hand , on which was a rich bracelet . Mr. Fox cut it off with his sword : the hand and bracelet fell into Lady Mary 's lap , who then contrived to escape unobserved , and got safe home to her brothers ’ house .</p>
   <p>A few days afterwards , Mr. Fox came to dine with them as usual . After dinner , the guests began to amuse each other with extraordinary anecdotes , and Lady Mary said she would relate to them a remarkable dream she had lately had . I dreamt , said she , that as you , Mr. Fox , had often invited me to your house , I would go there one morning . When I came to the house , I knocked at the door , but no one answered . When I opened the door , over the hall I saw written , “ Be bold , be bold , but not too bold . ” But , said she , turning to Mr. Fox , and smiling , “ It is not so , nor it was not so . ” Then she pursued the rest of the story , concluding at every turn with , “ It is not so , nor it was not so , ” till she came to the discovery of the room full of bones , when Mr. Fox took up the burden of the tale , and said :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">It is not so , nor it was not so ,</l>
     <l n="2">And God forbid it should be so !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>which he continued to repeat at every subsequent turn of the dreadful story , till she came to the circumstance of his cutting off the young lady 's hand , when , upon his saying , as usual ,</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">It is not so , nor it was not so ,</l>
     <l n="2">And God forbid it should be so !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">Lady Mary retorts by saying ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">But it is so , and it was so ,</l>
     <l n="5">And here the hand I have to show !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>at the same moment producing the hand and bracelet from her lap . Whereupon the guests drew their swords , and instantly cut Mr. Fox into a thousand pieces .</p>

    <head>THE OXFORD STUDENT .</head>
     <l n="1">[ Obtained in Oxfordshire from tradition . ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Many years ago there lived at the University of Oxford a young student , who , having seduced the daughter of a tradesman , sought to conceal his crime by committing the more heinous one of murder . With this view , he made an appointment to meet her one evening in a secluded field . She was at the rendezvous considerably before the time agreed upon for their meeting , and hid herself in a tree . The student arrived on the spot shortly afterwards , but what was the astonishment of the girl to observe that he commenced digging a grave . Her fears and suspicions were aroused , and she did not leave her place of concealment till the student , despairing of her arrival , returned to his college . The next day , when she was at the door of her father 's house , he passed and saluted her as usual . She returned his greeting by repeating the following lines :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">One moonshiny night , as I sat high ,</l>
     <l n="2">Waiting for one to come by ,</l>
     <l n="3">The boughs did bend ; my heart did ache</l>
     <l n="4">To see what hole the fox did make .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Astounded by her unexpected knowledge of his base design , in a moment of fury he stabbed her to the heart . This murder occasioned a violent conflict between the tradespeople and the students , the latter taking part with the murderer , and so fierce was the skirmish , that Brewer 's Lane , it is said , ran down with blood . The place of appointment was adjoining the Divinity Walk , which was in time past far more secluded than at the present day , and she is said to have been buried in the grave made for her by her paramour .</p>

     <l n="1">According to another version of the tale , the name of the student was</l>
     <l n="2">Fox , and a fellow-student went with him to assist in digging the grave .</l>

   <p>JACK HORNBY .</p>
   <note>This little tale was most likely copied from the commencement of the original edition of Jack the Giant-killer , where similar incidents are related of that renowned hero .</note>
   <p>In the reign of King Arthur there lived near the Land 's End , in Cornwall , a wealthy farmer , who had an only son , commonly called Jack Hornby . He was of a brisk and ready wit , and he was never known to be outwitted in any transaction .</p>
   <p>One day , when he was no more than seven years of age , his father sent him into the field to look after his oxen . While he was attending to them , the lord of the manor came across the field , and as Jack was known to be a clever boy , he began asking him questions . His first was , “ How many commandments are there ? ” Jack told him there were nine . The lord corrected him , saying there were ten . “ Nay , ” quoth Jack , “ you are wrong there : it is true there were ten , but you broke one of them when you stole my father 's cow for your rent . ” The lord of the manor was so struck by this answer , that he promised to return the poor man 's cow .</p>
   <p>“ Now , ” quoth Jack , “ it is my turn to ask a question . Can you tell me how many sticks go to build a crow 's nest ? ” “ Yes , ” said he , “ there are as many go as are sufficient for the size of the nest . ” “ Oh ! ” quoth Jack , “ you are out again ; there are none go , for they are all carried ! ”</p>
   <p>Jack Hornby was never more troubled with questions by the lord of the manor .</p>

    <head>MALLY DIXON AND KNURRE-MURRE .</head>
    <head>Stories of fairies appearing in the shape of cats are common in the North of England . Mr. Longstaffe relates that a farmer of Staindrop , in Durham , was one night crossing a bridge , when a cat jumped out , stood before him , and looking him full in the face , said :</head>
     <l n="1">Johnny Reed ! Johnny Reed !</l>
     <l n="2">Tell Madam Momfort</l>
     <l n="3">That Mally Dixon 's dead .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The farmer returned home , and in mickle wonder recited this awfu ’ stanza to his wife , when up started their black cat , saying , “ Is she ? ” and disappeared for ever . It was supposed she was a fairy in disguise , who thus went to attend a sister 's funeral , for in the North fairies do die , and green shady spots are pointed out by the country folks as the cemeteries of the tiny people . An analogous story is found in the people-literature of Denmark . Near a town called Lyng is the hill of Brondhoe , inhabited by the trold-folk , or imps . Amongst these trolds was an old sickly devil , peevish and ill-tempered , because he was married to a young wife . This unhappy trold often set the rest by the ears , so they nicknamed him Knurre-Murre , or Rumble-Grumble . Now it came to pass , that Knurre-Murre discovered that his young wife was inclined to honour him with a supplemental pair of horns ; and the object of his jealousy , to avoid his vengeance , was compelled to fly for his life from the cavern , and take refuge , in the shape of a tortoise-shell cat , in the house of Goodman Platt , who harboured him with much hospitality , let him lie on the great wicker chair , and fed him twice a day with bread and milk out of a red earthenware pipkin . One evening the goodman came home , at a late hour , full of wonderment . “ Goody , ” exclaimed he to his wife , “ as I was passing by Brondhoe , there came out a trold , who spake to me , saying ,</p>

     <l n="6">That Knurre-Murre is dead . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The tortoise-shell cat was lying on the great wicker chair , and eating his supper of bread and milk out of the red earthenware pipkin , when the goodman came in ; but as soon as the message was delivered , he jumped bolt upright upon his two hind legs , for all the world like a Christian , and kicking the red earthenware pipkin and the rest of the bread and milk before him , he whisked through the cottage door , mewing , “ What ! is Knurre-Murre dead ? then I may go home again !

    <head>THE BULL OF NORROWAY</head>
    <note>This is a modern version , taken down from recitation , of the very old tale of the Black Bull of Norroway , mentioned in the Complaynt of Scotland , 1548 . It is here taken , by the author 's kind permission , from the Popular Rhymes of Scotland , by Mr. Robert Chambers , the most delightful book of the kind ever published .</note>
     <l n="1">To wilder measures next they turn :</l>
     <l n="2">The black black bull of Norroway !</l>
     <l n="3">Sudden the tapers cease to burn ,</l>
     <l n="4">The minstrels cease to play !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Once upon a time there lived a king who had three daughters ; the two eldest were proud and ugly , but the youngest was the gentlest and most beautiful creature ever seen , and the pride not only of her father and mother , but of all in the land . As it fell out , the three princesses were talking one night of whom they would marry . “ I will have no one lower than a king , ” said the eldest princess ; the second would take a prince , or a great duke even . “ Pho , pho , ” said the youngest , laughing , “ you are both so proud ; now , I would be content with the Red Bull o ’ Norroway . ” Well , they thought no more of the matter till the next morning , when , as they sat at breakfast , they heard the most dreadful bellowing at the door , and what should it be but the Red Bull come for his bride . You may be sure they were all terribly frightened at this , for the Red Bull was one of the most horrible creatures ever seen in the world . And the king and queen did not know how to save their daughter . At last they determined to send him off with the old henwife . So they put her on his back , and away he went with her till he came to a great black forest , when , throwing her down , he returned , roaring louder and more frightfully than ever . They then sent , one by one , all the servants , then the two eldest princesses ; but not one of them met with any better treatment than the old henwife , and at last they were forced to send their youngest and favorite child .</p>
   <p>On travelled the lady and the bull through many dreadful forests and lonely wastes , till they came at last to a noble castle , where a large company was assembled . The lord of the castle pressed them to stay , though much he wondered at the lovely princess and her strange companion . When they went in among the company , the princess espied a pin sticking in the bull 's hide , which she pulled out , and , to the surprise of all , there appeared not a frightful wild beast , but one of the most beautiful princes ever beheld . You may believe how delighted the princess was to see him fall at her feet , and thank her for breaking his cruel enchantment . There were great rejoicings in the castle at this ; but , alas ! at that moment he suddenly disappeared , and though every place was sought , he was nowhere to be found . The princess , however , determined to seek through all the world for him , and many weary ways she went , but nothing could she hear of her lover . Travelling once through a dark wood , she lost her way , and as night was coming on , she thought she must now certainly die of cold and hunger ; but seeing a light through the trees , she went on till she came to a little hut , where an old woman lived , who took her in , and gave her both food and shelter . In the morning , the old wifie gave her three nuts , that she was not to break till her heart was “ like to break , and owre again like to break ; ” so , showing her the way , she bade God speed her , and the princess once more set out on her wearisome journey .</p>
   <p>She had not gone far till a company of lords and ladies rode past her , all talking merrily of the fine doings they expected at the Duke o ’ Norroway 's wedding . Then she came up to a number of people carrying all sorts of fine things , and they , too , were going to the duke 's wedding . At last she came to a castle , where nothing was to be seen but cooks and bakers , some running one way , and some another , and all so busy that they did not know what to do first . Whilst she was looking at all this , she heard a noise of hunters behind her , and some one cried out , “ Make way for the Duke o ’ Norroway ! ” and who should ride past but the prince and a beautiful lady ! You may be sure her heart was now “ like to break , and owre again like to break , ” at this sad sight ; so she broke one of the nuts , and out came a wee wifie carding . The princess then went into the castle , and asked to see the lady , who no sooner saw the wee wifie so hard at work , than she offered the princess anything in her castle for it . “ I will give it to you , ” said she , “ only on condition that you put off for one day your marriage with the Duke o ’ Norroway , and that I may go into his room alone to-night . ” So anxious was the lady for the nut , that she consented . And when dark night was come , and the duke fast asleep , the princess was put alone into his chamber . Sitting down by his bedside , she began singing :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Far hae I sought ye , near am I brought to ye ;</l>
     <l n="2">Dear Duke of Norroway , will ye no turn and speak to me ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Though she sang this over and over again , the duke never wakened , and in the morning the princess had to leave him , without his knowing she had ever been there . She then broke the second nut , and out came a wee wifie spinning , which so delighted the lady , that she readily agreed to put off her marriage another day for it ; but the princess came no better speed the second night than the first , and , almost in despair , she broke the last nut , which contained a wee wifie reeling ; and on the same condition as before , the lady got possession of it . When the duke was dressing in the morning , his man asked him what the strange singing and moaning that had been heard in his room for two nights meant . “ I heard nothing , ” said the duke ; “ it could only have been your fancy . ” “ Take no sleeping-draught to night , and be sure to lay aside your pillow of heaviness , ” said the man , “ and you also will hear what for two nights has kept me awake . ” The duke did so , and the princess coming in , sat down sighing at his bedside , thinking this the last time she might ever see him . The duke started up when he heard the voice of his dearly-loved princess ; and with many endearing expressions of surprise and joy , explained to her that he had long been in the power of an enchantress , whose spells over him were now happily ended by their once again meeting . The princess , happy to be the instrument of his second deliverance , consented to marry him , and the enchantress , who fled that country , afraid of the duke 's anger , has never since been heard of . All was hurry and preparation in the castle , and the marriage which now took place at once ended the adventures of the Red Bull o ’ Norroway and the wanderings of the king 's daughter .</p>
   <p>PUSS IN BOOTS .</p>
   <note>One of the tales of Perrault , 1697 . The plot was taken from the first novel of the eleventh night of Straparola . Its moral is that talents are equivalent to fortune . We have inserted this in our collection , although generally remembered , as a specimen of the simple tales founded by Perrault on older stories , and which soon became popular in this country . The others , as Blue Beard , and Little Riding Hood , are vanishing from the nursery , but are so universally known that reprints of them would be superfluous .</note>
   <p>There was a miller , who left no more estate to his three sons than his mill , his ass , and his cat . The partition was soon made , neither scrivener nor attorney being sent for . They would soon have eaten up all the patrimony . The eldest had the mill , the second the ass , and the youngest nothing but the cat .</p>
   <p>The poor young fellow was quite downcast at so poor a lot . “ My brothers , ” said he , “ may get their living handsomely enough by joining their stocks together , but for my part , when I have eaten up my cat , and made me a muff of his skin , I must die with hunger . ” The cat , who heard all this , yet made as if he did not , said to him , with a grave and serious air , “ Do not thus afflict yourself , my good master ; you have nothing else to do but give me a bag , and get a pair of boots made for me , that I may scamper through the dirt and the brambles , and you shall see that you have not so bad a portion as you imagine . ” Though he did not build very much upon what the cat said , he had however often seen him play a great many cunning tricks to catch rats and mice : as when he used to hang by the heels , or hide himself in the meal , and make as if he were dead ; so that he did not altogether despair of his affording him some help in his miserable condition . When the cat had what he asked for , he booted himself very gallantly ; and putting the bag about his neck , held the strings of it in his two fore paws , and went into a warren where there was a great abundance of rabbits . He put bran and sow-thistles into the bag , and stretching himself out at length , as if he had been dead , he waited for some young rabbits not yet acquainted with the deceits of the world , to come and rummage his bag for what he had put into it .</p>
   <p>Scarce was he laid down , but he had what he wanted ; a rash and foolish young rabbit jumped into his bag , and Monsieur Puss immediately drawing the strings close , took and killed him without pity . Proud of his prey , he went with it into the palace , and asked to speak with his majesty . He was shown upstairs into the king 's apartment , and , making a low reverence , said to him , “ I have brought you , Sire , a rabbit of the warren , which my noble lord , the Marquis of Carabas ( for that was the title which Puss was pleased to give his master ) , has commanded me to present to your majesty from him . ” “ Tell thy master , ” said the king , “ that I thank him , and he does me a great deal of pleasure . ”</p>
   <p>Another time he went and hid himself amongst some standing corn , holding his bag open ; and when a brace of partridges ran into it , he drew the strings , and so caught them both . He went and made a present of these to the king , as he had done before of the rabbit . The king received the partridges with great pleasure , and ordered him some money for drink .</p>
   <p>The cat continued , for two or three months , to carry game to his majesty . One day in particular , when he knew that the king was to take the air along the river side , with his daughter , the most beautiful princess in the world , he said to his master , “ If you will follow my advice , your fortune is made ; you have nothing else to do , but go and wash yourself in the river , in that part I shall show you , and leave the rest to me . ” The Marquis of Carabas did what the cat advised , without knowing why or wherefore .</p>
   <p>While he was washing , the king passed by , and the cat began to cry out , as loud as he could , “ Help , help ! my Lord Marquis of Carabas is going to be drowned ! ” At this noise the king put his head out of the coach-window , and finding it was the cat who had so often brought him such good game , he commanded the guards to run immediately to the assistance of his lordship , the Marquis of Carabas .</p>
   <p>While they were drawing the poor marquis out of the river , the cat came up to the coach and told the king , that , while his master was washing , there came by some rogues who went off with his clothes , though he had cried out , “ Thieves ! thieves ! ” several times , as loud as he could . This cunning cat had hidden them under a great stone . The king immediately commanded the officers of his wardrobe to run and fetch one of his best suits for the Lord Marquis of Carabas .</p>
   <p>The king caressed him after a very extraordinary manner , and as the fine clothes he had given him extremely set off his good mien ( for he was well-made and very handsome in his person ) , the king 's daughter took a secret inclination to him , and the Marquis of Carabas had no sooner cast two or three respectful and tender glances , but she fell in love with him to distraction ; and the king would have him come into his coach . The cat , overjoyed to see his project begin to succeed , marched on before , and meeting with some countrymen who were mowing a meadow , he said to them , “ Good people , if you do not tell the king that the meadow you mow belongs to the Marquis of Carabas , you shall be chopped as small as herbs for the pot . ”</p>
   <p>The king did not fail to ask the mowers to whom the meadow they were mowing belonged . “ To my Lord Marquis of Carabas , ” answered they all together ; for the cat 's threats had made them terribly afraid . “ You see , sir , ” said the marquis , “ this is a meadow that never fails to yield a plentiful harvest every year . ” The cat , who still went on before , met with some reapers , and said to them , “ Good people , you who are reaping , if you do not tell the king that all this corn belongs to the Marquis of Carabas , you shall be chopped as small as herbs for the pot . ” The king , who passed by a moment after , would needs know to whom all that corn did belong . “ To my Lord Marquis of Carabas , ” replied the reapers ; and the king was very well pleased with it , as well as the marquis , whom he congratulated thereupon . The master cat went always before , saying the same words to all he met ; and the king was astonished at the vast estates of my Lord Marquis of Carabas . Monsieur Puss came at last to a stately castle , the master of which was an ogre , the richest that had ever been known ; for all the lands the king had then gone over belonged to him ; the cat , having taken care to inform himself who this ogre was , and what he could do , asked to speak to him , saying , “ He could not pass so near his castle , without having the honour of paying his respects to him . ”</p>
   <p>The ogre received him as civilly as an ogre could do , and made him sit down . “ I have been assured , ” said the cat , “ that you have the gift of being able to change yourself into all sorts of creatures you have a mind to ; you can , for example , transform yourself into a lion or elephant , and the like . ” “ This is true , ” answered the ogre , very briskly , “ and to convince you , you shall see me now become a lion . ” Puss was so sadly terrified at the sight of a lion so near him , that he immediately got into the gutter , not without great trouble and danger , because of his boots , which were of no use at all to him in walking upon the tiles . A little while after , when Puss saw that the ogre had resumed his natural form , he came down , and owned that he had been very much frightened .</p>
   <p>“ I have been moreover informed , ” said the cat , “ but I know not how to believe it , that you have also the power to take upon you the smallest animals , for example , to change yourself into a rat or a mouse , but I must own to you , I take this to be impossible . ” “ Impossible ! ” cried the ogre , “ you shall see that presently ; ” and at the same time changed himself into a mouse , and began to run about the floor . Puss no sooner perceived this , but he fell upon him , and eat him up .</p>
   <p>Meanwhile the king , who saw as he passed this fine castle of the ogre 's , had a mind to go into it . Puss , who heard the noise of his majesty 's coach running over the drawbridge , ran out , and said to the king , “ Your majesty is welcome to this castle of the Lord Marquis of Carabas . ” “ What ! my lord marquis , ” cried the king , “ and does this castle also belong to you ? there can be nothing finer than this court , and all the stately buildings which surround it : let us go into it , if you please . ”</p>
   <p>The king went up first , the marquis , handing the princess , following ; they passed into a spacious hall , where they found a magnificent collation the ogre had prepared for his friends , who dared not enter , knowing the king was there . His majesty was perfectly charmed with the good qualities of the marquis , and his daughter was violently in love with him . The king , after having drank five or six glasses , said to him , “ My lord marquis , you will be only to blame , if you are not my son-in-law . ” The marquis , making several low bows , accepted the honour his majesty conferred upon him , and forthwith the very same day married the princess .</p>
   <p>Puss became a great lord , and never ran after mice any more but only for his diversion .</p>
   <p>JACK AND THE GIANTS .</p>
   <note>The present copy of this tale is taken , with a few necessary alterations , from the original editions , which differ very considerably from the modern versions ; and it is worthy of preservation in its antique costume , for the story is undoubtedly of Teutonic origin . “ Jack , commonly called the Giant Killer , ” says Sir W. Scott , “ and Thomas Thumb landed in England from the very same keels and war-ships which conveyed Hengist and Horsa , and Ebba the Saxon . ” One incident in the romance exactly corresponds to a device played by the giant Skrimner , when he and Thor travelled to Utgard Castle , related in the Edda of Snorro . Skrimner placed an immense rock on the leafy couch where Thor supposed he was sleeping , and when the latter , desiring to rid himself of his companion , heard the giant snore , he struck the rock with his tremendous hammer , thinking it was the monster 's head . “ Hath a leaf fallen upon me from the tree ? ” exclaimed the awakened giant . He went to sleep again , and snoring louder than ever , Thor gave a blow which he thought must have cracked his skull . “ What is the matter ? ” quoth Skrimner , “ hath an acorn fallen on my head ? ” A third time the snore was heard , and a third time the hammer fell with redoubled force , insomuch that Thor weened the iron had buried itself in Skrimner 's temples . “ Methinks , ” quoth the giant , rubbing his cheek , “ some moss hath fallen on my face ! ” Jack 's invisible coat , his magic sword , and his shoes of swiftness , are also undoubtedly borrowed from Northern romance . [ 20</note>
   <note xml:id="note20" place="bottom" n="20">The last is also found in the second relation of Ssidi Kur , a Calmuck romance .</note>
   <p>An incident very similar to the blows with the rat 's tail occurs in the story of the Brave Little Tailor , in Grimm ; who outwits a giant in several ingenious ways , one of which may be described . On one occasion the giant wished to try the strength of the tailor , by challenging him to carry a tree . The latter said , “ Very well , you carry the butt-end , while I will carry all the branches , by far the heaviest part of the tree . ” So the giant lifted the tree up on his shoulders , and the tailor very coolly sat on the branches while the giant carried the tree . At length he was so tired with his load , he was obliged to drop it , and the tailor , nimbly jumping off , made belief as if he had been carrying the branches all the time , and said : “ A pretty fellow you are , that can n't carry a tree ! ”</p>
   <p>The edition of Jack the Giant-killer here used was printed at Newcastle-on-Tyne in 1711 . The earliest in the British Museum is dated 1809 , nor does the Bodleian , I believe , contain a copy of a more ancient type .</p>
   <p>Jack and the Bean-stalk may be added to the series of English nursery-tales derived from the Teutonic . The bean-stalk is a descendant of the wonderful ash in the Edda . The distich put into the mouth of the giant ,</p>

   <p>In the reign of King Arthur , and in the county of Cornwall , near to the Land 's End of England , there lived a wealthy farmer , who had an only son named Jack . He was brisk , and of a lively ready wit , so that whatever he could not perform by force and strength , he accomplished by ingenious wit and policy . Never was any person heard of that could worst him , and he very often even baffled the learned by his sharp and ready inventions .</p>
   <p>In those days the Mount of Cornwall was kept by a huge and monstrous giant of eighteen feet in height , and about three yards in compass , of a fierce and grim countenance , the terror of all the neighbouring towns and villages . He inhabited a cave in the middle of the mount , and he was such a selfish monster that he would not suffer any one to live near him . He fed on other men 's cattle , which often became his prey , for whensoever he wanted food , he would wade over to the main land , where he would furnish himself with whatever came in his way . The inhabitants , at his approach , forsook their habitations , while he seized on their cattle , making nothing of carrying half-a-dozen oxen on his back at a time ; and as for their sheep and hogs , he would tie them round his waist like a bunch of bandoleers .<span corresp="#note21" type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span>This course he had followed for many years , so that a great part of the county was impoverished by his depredations .</p>
   <note xml:id="note21" place="bottom" n="21">Bandoleers were little wooden cases covered with leather , each of them containing the charge of powder for a musket , and fastened to a broad band of leather , which the person who was to use them put round his neck .</note>
   <p>This was the state of affairs , when Jack , happening one day to be present at the town-hall when the authorities were consulting about the giant , had the curiosity to ask what reward would be given to the person who destroyed him . The giant 's treasure was declared as the recompense , and Jack at once undertook the task .</p>
   <p>In order to accomplish his purpose , he furnished himself with a horn , shovel , and pickaxe , and went over to the Mount in the beginning of a dark winter 's evening , when he fell to work , and before morning had dug a pit twenty-two feet deep , and nearly as broad , covering it over with long sticks and straw . Then strewing a little mould upon it , it appeared like plain ground . This accomplished , Jack placed himself on the side of the pit which was furthest from the giant 's lodging , and , just at the break of day , he put the horn to his mouth , and blew with all his might , Although Jack was a little fellow , and the powers of his voice are not described as being very great , he managed to make noise enough to arouse the giant , and excite his indignation . The monster accordingly rushed from his cave , exclaiming , “ You incorrigible villain , are you come here to disturb my rest ? you shall pay dearly for this . Satisfaction I will have , for I will take you whole and broil you for breakfast . ” He had no sooner uttered this cruel threat , than tumbling into the pit , he made the very foundations of the Mount ring again . “ Oh , giant , ” said Jack , “ where are you now ? Oh faith , you are gotten now into Lob 's Pound ,<span corresp="#note22" type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span>where I will surely plague you for your threatening words : what do you think now of broiling me for your breakfast ? will no other diet serve you but poor Jack ? ” Thus did little Jack tantalize the big giant , as a cat does a mouse when she knows it cannot escape , and when he had tired of that amusement , he gave him a heavy blow with his pickaxe on the very crown of his head , which “ tumbled him down , ” and killed him on the spot . When Jack saw he was dead , he filled up the pit with earth , and went to search the cave , which he found contained much treasure . The magistrates , in the exuberance of their joy , did not add to Jack 's gains from their own , but after the best and cheapest mode of payment , made a declaration he should henceforth be termed Jack the Giant-killer , and presented him with a sword and embroidered belt , on the latter of which were inscribed these words in letters of gold :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Here 's the right valiant Cornish man ,</l>
     <l n="2">Who slew the giant Cormelian .</l>
   </lg>
   <note xml:id="note22" place="bottom" n="22">An old jocular term for a prison , or any place of confinement .</note>
   <p>The news of Jack 's victory , as might be expected , soon spread over all the West of England , so that another giant , named Thunderbore , hearing of it , and entertaining a partiality for his race , vowed to be revenged on the little hero , if ever it was his fortune to light on him . This giant was the lord of an enchanted castle , situated in the midst of a lonely wood . Now Jack , about four months after his last exploit , walking near this castle in his journey towards Wales , being weary , seated himself near a pleasant fountain in the wood , “ o'ercanopied with luscious woodbine , ” and presently fell asleep . While he was enjoying his repose , the giant , coming to the fountain for water , of course discovered him , and recognised the hated individual by the lines written on the belt . He immediately took Jack on his shoulders , and carried him towards his enchanted castle . Now , as they passed through a thicket , the rustling of the boughs awakened Jack , who was uncomfortably surprised to find himself in the clutches of the giant . His terror was not diminished when , on entering the castle , he saw the court-yard strewed with human bones , the giant maliciously telling him his own would ere long increase the hateful pile . After this assurance , the cannibal locked poor Jack in an upper chamber , leaving him there while he went to fetch another giant living in the same wood to keep him company in the anticipated destruction of their enemy . While he was gone , dreadful shrieks and lamentations affrighted Jack , especially a voice which continually cried ,—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Do what you can to get away ,</l>
     <l n="2">Or you 'll become the giant 's prey ;</l>
     <l n="3">He 's gone to fetch his brother , who</l>
     <l n="4">Will kill , and likewise torture you .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This warning , and the hideous tone in which it was delivered , almost distracted poor Jack , who going to the window , and opening a casement , beheld afar off the two giants approaching towards the castle . “ Now , ” quoth Jack to himself , “ my death or my deliverance is at hand . ” The event proved that his anticipations were well founded , for the giants of those days , however powerful , were at best very stupid fellows , and readily conquered by stratagem , were it of the humblest kind . There happened to be strong cords in the room in which Jack was confined , two of which he took , and made a strong noose at the end of each ; and while the giant was unlocking the iron gate of the castle , he threw the ropes over each of their heads , and then , before the giants knew what he was about , he drew the other ends across a beam , and , pulling with all his might , throttled them till they were black in the face . Then , sliding down the rope , he came to their heads , and as they could not defend themselves , easily despatched them with his sword . This business so adroitly accomplished , Jack released the fair prisoners in the castle , delivered the keys to them , and , like a true knight-errant , continued his journey without condescending to improve the condition of his purse .</p>
   <p>This plan , however honorable , was not without its disadvantages , and owing to his slender stock of money , he was obliged to make the best of his way by travelling as hard as he could . At length , losing his road , he was belated , and could not get to any place of entertainment until , coming to a lonesome valley , he found a large house , and by reason of his present necessity , took courage to knock at the gate . But what was his astonishment , when there came forth a monstrous giant with two heads ; yet he did not appear so fiery as the others were , for he was a Welsh giant , and what he did was by private and secret malice under the false show of friendship . Jack having unfolded his condition to the giant , was shown into a bedroom , where , in the dead of night , he heard his host in another apartment uttering these formidable words :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Though here you lodge with me this night ,</l>
     <l n="2">You shall not see the morning light :</l>
     <l n="3">My club shall dash your brains out quite !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Say'st thou so , ” quoth Jack ; “ that is like one of your Welsh tricks , yet I hope to be cunning enough for you . ” He immediately got out of bed , and , feeling about in the dark , found a thick billet of wood , which he laid in the bed in his stead , and hid himself in a dark corner of the room . Shortly after he had done so , in came the Welsh giant , who thoroughly pummelled the billet with his club , thinking , naturally enough , he had broken every bone in Jack 's skin . The next morning , however , to the inexpressible surprise of the giant , Jack came down stairs as if nothing had happened , and gave him thanks for his night 's lodging . “ How have you rested , ” quoth the giant ; “ did you not feel anything in the night ? ” Jack provokingly replied , “ No , nothing but a rat which gave me two or three flaps with her tail . ” This reply was totally incomprehensible to the giant , who of course saw anything but a joke in it . However , concealing his amazement as well as he could , he took Jack in to breakfast , assigning to each a bowl containing four gallons of hasty pudding . One would have thought that the greater portion of so extravagant an allowance would have been declined by our hero , but he was unwilling the giant should imagine his incapability to eat it , and accordingly placed a large leather bag under his loose coat , in such a position that he could convey the pudding into it without the deception being perceived . Breakfast at length being finished , Jack excited the giant 's curiosity by offering to show him an extraordinary sleight of hand ; so taking a knife , he ripped the leather bag , and out of course descended on the ground all the hasty pudding . The giant had not the slightest suspicion of the trick , veritably believing the pudding came from its natural receptacle ; and having the same antipathy to being beaten , exclaimed in true Welsh , “ Odds splutters , hur can do that trick hurself . ” The sequel may be readily guessed . The monster took the knife , and thinking to follow Jack 's example with impunity , killed himself on the spot .<span corresp="#note23" type="note_anchor">[ 23 ]</span></p>
   <note xml:id="note23" place="bottom" n="23">The foregoing portion of this wonderful history is that most generally known ; but the incidents now become more complicated , and after the introduction of Arthur 's son upon the scene , we arrive at particulars which have long been banished from the nursery library .</note>
   <p>King Arthur 's only son requested his father to furnish him with a large sum of money , in order that he might go and seek his fortune in the principality of Wales , where lived a beautiful lady possessed with seven evil spirits . The king tried all he could do to persuade him to alter his determination , but it was all in vain , so at last he granted his request , and the prince set out with two horses , one loaded with money , the other for himself to ride upon . Now , after several days ’ travel , he came to a market-town in Wales , where he beheld a vast concourse of people gathered together . The prince demanded the reason of it , and was told that they had arrested a corpse for several large sums of money which the deceased owed when he died . The prince replied that it was a pity creditors should be so cruel , and said , “ Go bury the dead , and let his creditors come to my lodging , and there their debts shall be discharged . ” They accordingly came , but in such great numbers , that before night he had almost left himself penniless .</p>
   <p>Now Jack the Giant-killer happened to be in the town while these transactions took place , and he was so pleased with the generosity exhibited by the prince , that he offered to become his servant , an offer which was immediately accepted . The next morning they set forward on their journey , when , as they were just leaving the town , an old woman called after the prince , saying , “ He has owed me twopence these seven years ; pray pay me as well as the rest . ” So reasonable and urgent a demand could not be resisted , and the prince immediately discharged the debt , but it took the last penny he had to accomplish it . This event , though generally ridiculed by heroes , was one by no means overlooked by the prince , who required all Jack 's assuring eloquence to console him . Jack himself , indeed , had a very poor exchequer , and after their day 's refreshment , they were entirely without money . When night drew on , the prince was anxious to secure a lodging , but as they had no means to hire one , Jack said , “ Never mind , master , we shall do well enough , for I have an uncle lives within two miles of this place ; he is a huge and monstrous giant with three heads ; he 'll fight five hundred men in armour , and make them flee before him . ” “ Alas ! ” quoth the prince , “ what shall we do there ? He 'll certainly chop us up at a mouthful . Nay , we are scarce enough to fill his hollow tooth ! ” “ It is no matter for that , ” quoth Jack ; “ I myself will go before , and prepare the way for you ; therefore tarry and wait till I return . ” Jack then rides off full speed , and coming to the gate of the castle , he knocked so loud that the neighbouring hills resounded like thunder . The giant , terribly vexed with the liberty taken by Jack , roared out , “ Who 's there ? ” He was answered , “ None but your poor cousin Jack . ” Quoth he , “ What news with my poor cousin Jack ? ” He replied , “ Dear uncle , heavy news . ” “ God wot , ” quoth the giant , “ prithee what heavy news can come to me ? I am a giant with three heads , and besides thou knowest I can fight five hundred men in armour , and make them fly like chaff before the wind . ” “ Oh , but , ” quoth Jack , “ here 's the prince a-coming with a thousand men in armour to kill you , and destroy all that you have ! ” “ Oh , cousin Jack , ” said the giant , “ this is heavy news indeed ! I will immediately run and hide myself , and thou shalt lock , bolt , and bar me in , and keep the keys till the prince is gone . ” Jack joyfully complied with the giant 's request , and fetching his master , they feasted and made themselves merry whilst the poor giant laid trembling in a vault under ground .</p>
   <p>In the morning , Jack furnished the prince with a fresh supply of gold and silver , and then sent him three miles forward on his journey , concluding , according to the story-book , “ he was then pretty well out of the smell of the giant . ” Jack afterwards returned , and liberated the giant from the vault , who asked what he should give him for preserving the castle from destruction . “ Why , ” quoth Jack , “ I desire nothing but the old coat and cap , together with the old rusty sword and slippers which are at your bed 's head . ” Quoth the giant , “ Thou shalt have them , and pray keep them for my sake , for they are things of excellent use ; the coat will keep you invisible , the cap will furnish you with knowledge , the sword cuts asunder whatever you strike , and the shoes are of extraordinary swiftness . These may be serviceable to you : therefore take them with all my heart . ”</p>
   <p>Jack was delighted with these useful presents , and having overtaken his master , they quickly arrived at the lady 's house , who , finding the prince to be a suitor , prepared a splendid banquet for him . After the repast was concluded , she wiped his mouth with a handkerchief , and then concealed it in her dress , saying , “ You must show me that handkerchief to-morrow morning , or else you will lose your head . ” The prince went to bed in great sorrow at this hard condition , but fortunately Jack 's cap of knowledge instructed him how it was to be fulfilled . In the middle of the night she called upon her familiar<span corresp="#note24" type="note_anchor">[ 24 ]</span>to carry her to the evil spirit . Jack immediately put on his coat of darkness , and his shoes of swiftness , and was there before her , his coat rendering him invisible . When she entered the lower regions , she gave the handkerchief to the spirit , who laid it upon a shelf , whence Jack took it , and brought it to his master , who showed it to the lady the next day , and so saved his life . The next evening at supper she saluted the prince , telling him he must show her the lips tomorrow morning that she kissed last this night , or lose his head . He replied , “ If you kiss none but mine , I will . ” “ That is neither here nor there , ” said she , “ if you do not , death is your portion ! ” At midnight she went below as before , and was angry with the spirit for letting the handkerchief go : “ But now , ” quoth she , “ I will be too hard for the prince , for I will kiss thee , and he is to show me thy lips . ” She did so , and Jack , who was standing by , cut off the spirit 's head , and brought it under his invisible coat to his master , who produced it triumphantly the next morning before the lady . This feat destroyed the enchantment , the evil spirits immediately forsook her , and she appeared still more sweet and lovely , beautiful as she was before . They were married the next morning , and shortly afterwards went to the court of King Arthur , where Jack , for his eminent services , was created one of the knights of the Round Table .</p>
   <note xml:id="note24" place="bottom" n="24">An attendant spirit .</note>
   <p>Our hero , having been successful in all his undertakings , and resolving not to remain idle , but to perform what services he could for the honour of his country , humbly besought his majesty to fit him out with a horse and money to enable him to travel in search of new adventures ; for , said he , “ there are many giants yet living in the remote part of Wales , to the unspeakable damage of your majesty 's subjects ; wherefore may it please you to encourage me , I do not doubt but in a short time to cut them off root and branch , and so rid all the realm of those giants and monsters in human shape . ” We need scarcely say that Jack 's generous offer was at once accepted . The king furnished him with the necessary accoutrements , and Jack set out with his magical cap , sword , and shoes , the better to perform the dangerous enterprises which now lay before him .</p>
   <p>After travelling over several hills and mountains , the country through which he passed offering many impediments to travellers , on the third day he arrived at a very large wood , which he had no sooner entered than his ears were assailed with piercing shrieks . Advancing softly towards the place where the cries appeared to proceed from , he was horror-struck at perceiving a huge giant dragging along a fair lady , and a knight her husband , by the hair of their heads , “ with as much ease , ” says the original narrative , “ as if they had been a pair of gloves . ” Jack shed tears of pity on the fate of this hapless couple , but not suffering his feelings to render him neglectful of action , he put on his invisible coat , and taking with him his infallible sword , succeeded , after considerable trouble , and many cuts , to despatch the monster , whose dying groans were so terrible , that they made the whole wood ring again . The courteous knight and his fair lady were overpowered with gratitude , and , after returning Jack their best thanks , they invited him to their residence , there to recruit his strength after the frightful encounter , and receive more substantial demonstrations of their obligations to him . Jack , however , declared that he would not rest until he had found out the giant 's habitation . The knight , on hearing this determination , was very sorrowful , and replied , “ Noble stranger , it is too much to run a second hazard : this monster lived in a den under yonder mountain , with a brother more fierce and cruel than himself . Therefore , if you should go thither , and perish in the attempt , it would be a heart-breaking to me and my lady : let me persuade you to go with us , and desist from any further pursuit . ” The knight 's reasoning had the very opposite effect that was intended , for Jack , hearing of another giant , eagerly embraced the opportunity of displaying his skill , promising , however , to return to the knight when he had accomplished his second labour .</p>
   <p>He had not ridden more than a mile and a half , when the cave mentioned by the knight appeared to view , near the entrance of which he beheld the giant , sitting upon a block of timber , with a knotted iron club by his side , waiting , as he supposed , for his brother 's return with his barbarous prey . This giant is described as having “ goggle eyes like flames of fire , a countenance grim and ugly , cheeks like a couple of large flitches of bacon , the bristles of his beard resembling rods of iron wire , and locks that hung down upon his brawny shoulders like curled snakes or hissing adders . ” Jack alighted from his horse , and putting on the invisible coat , approached near the giant , and said softly , “ Oh ! are you there ? it will not be long ere I shall take you fast by the beard . ” The giant all this while could not see him , on account of his invisible coat , so that Jack , coming up close to the monster , struck a blow with his sword at his head , but unfortunately missing his aim , he cut off the nose instead . The giant , as we may suppose , “ roared like claps of thunder , ” and began to lay about him in all directions with his iron club so desperately , that even Jack was frightened , but exercising his usual ingenuity , he soon despatched him . After this , Jack cut off the giant 's head , and sent it , together with that of his brother , to King Arthur , by a waggoner he hired for that purpose , who gave an account of all his wonderful proceedings .</p>
   <p>The redoubtable Jack next proceeded to search the giant 's cave in search of his treasure , and passing along through a great many winding passages , he came at length to a large room paved with freestone , at the upper end of which was a boiling caldron , and on the right hand a large table , at which the giants usually dined . After passing this dining-room , he came to a large and well-secured den filled with human captives , who were fattened and taken at intervals for food , as we do poultry . Jack set the poor prisoners at liberty , and , to compensate them for their sufferings and dreadful anticipations , shared the giant 's treasure equally amongst them , and sent them to their homes overjoyed at their unexpected deliverance .</p>
   <p>It was about sunrise when Jack , after the conclusion of this adventure , having had a good night 's rest , mounted his horse to proceed on his journey , and , by the help of directions , reached the knight 's house about noon . He was received with the most extraordinary demonstrations of joy , and his kind host , out of respect to Jack , prepared a feast which lasted many days , all the nobility and gentry in the neighbourhood being invited to it . The knight related the hero 's adventures to his assembled guests , and presented him with a beautiful ring , on which was engraved a representation of the giant dragging the distressed knight and his lady , with this motto :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">We were in sad distress you see ,</l>
     <l n="2">Under the giant 's fierce command ,</l>
     <l n="3">But gain 'd our lives and liberty</l>
     <l n="4">By valiant Jack 's victorious hand .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But earthly happiness is not generally of long duration , and so in some respects it proved on the present occasion , for in the midst of the festivities arrived a messenger with the dismal intelligence that one Thunderdell , a giant with two heads , having heard of the death of his two kinsmen , came from the north to be revenged on Jack , and was already within a mile of the knight 's house , the country people flying before him in all directions . The intelligence had no effect on the dauntless Jack , who immediately said , “ Let him come ! I have a tool to pick his teeth ; ” and with this elegant assertion , he invited the guests to witness his performance from a high terrace in the garden of the castle .</p>
   <p>It is now necessary to inform the reader that the knight 's house or castle was situated in an island encompassed with a moat thirty feet deep , and twenty feet wide , passable by a drawbridge . Now Jack , intending to accomplish his purpose by a clever stratagem , employed men to cut through this drawbridge on both sides nearly to the middle ; and then , dressing himself in his invisible coat , he marched against the giant with his well-tried sword . As he approached his adversary , although invisible , the giant , being , as it appears , an epicure in such matters , was aware of his approach , and exclaimed , in a fearful tone of voice —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Fi , fee , fo , fum !<span corresp="#note25" type="note_anchor">[ 25 ]</span></l>
     <l n="2">I smell the blood of an English man !</l>
     <l n="3">Be he alive or be he dead ,</l>
     <l n="4">I 'll grind his bones to make me bread !</l>
   </lg>
   <note xml:id="note25" place="bottom" n="25">These lines are quoted by Edgar in the tragedy of King Lear .</note>
   <p>“ Say you so , ” said Jack ; “ then you are a monstrous miller indeed . ” The giant , deeply incensed , replied , “ Art thou that villain who killed my kinsman ? then I will tear thee with my teeth , and grind thy bones to powder . ” “ But , ” says Jack , still provoking him , “ you must catch me first , if you please : ” so putting aside his invisible coat , so that the giant might see him , and putting on his wonderful shoes , he enticed him into a chase by just approaching near enough to give him an apparent chance of capture . The giant , we are told , “ followed like a walking castle , so that the very foundations of the earth seemed to shake at every step . ” Jack led him a good distance , in order that the wondering guests at the castle might see him to advantage , but at last , to end the matter , he ran over the drawbridge , the giant pursuing him with his club ; but coming to the place where the bridge was cut , the giant 's great weight burst it asunder , and he was precipitated into the moat , where he rolled about , says the author , “ like a vast whale . ” While the monster was in this condition , Jack sadly bantered him about the boast he had made of grinding his bones to powder , but at length , having teased him sufficiently , a cart-rope was cast over the two heads of the giant , and he was drawn ashore by a team of horses , where Jack served him as he had done his relatives , cut off his heads , and sent them to King Arthur .</p>
   <p>It would seem that the giant-killer rested a short time after this adventure , but he was soon tired of inactivity , and again went in search of another giant , the last whose head he was destined to chop off . After passing a long distance , he came at length to a large mountain , at the foot of which was a very lonely house . Knocking at the door , it was opened by “ an ancient<span corresp="#note26" type="note_anchor">[ 26 ]</span>man , with a head as white as snow , ” who received Jack very courteously , and at once consented to his request for a lodging . Whilst they were at supper , the old man , who appears to have known more than was suspected , thus addressed the hero : “ Son , I am sensible you are a conqueror of giants , and I therefore inform you that on the top of this mountain is an enchanted castle , maintained by a giant named Galligantus , who , by the help of a conjuror , gets many knights into his castle , where they are transformed into sundry shapes and forms : but , above all , I especially lament a duke 's daughter , whom they took from her father 's garden , bringing her through the air in a chariot drawn by fiery dragons , and securing her within the castle walls , transformed her into the shape of a hind . Now , though a great many knights have endeavoured to break the enchantment , and work her deliverance , yet no one has been able to accomplish it , on account of two fiery griffins which are placed at the gate , and which destroyed them at their approach ; but you , my son , being furnished with an invisible coat , may pass by them undiscovered , and on the gates of the castle you will find engraven in large characters by what means the enchantment may be broken . ” The undaunted Jack at once accepted the commission , and pledged his faith to the old man to proceed early in the morning on this new adventure .</p>
   <note xml:id="note26" place="bottom" n="26">An old man .</note>
   <p>In the morning , as soon as it was daylight , Jack put on his invisible coat , and prepared himself for the enterprise . When he had reached the top of the mountain , he discovered the two fiery griffins , but , being invisible , he passed them without the slightest danger . When he had reached the gate of the castle , he noticed a golden trumpet attached to it , under which were written in large characters the following lines :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Whoever doth this trumpet blow ,<span corresp="#note27" type="note_anchor">[ 27 ]</span></l>
     <l n="2">Shall soon the giant overthrow ,</l>
     <l n="3">And break the black enchantment straight ,</l>
     <l n="4">So all shall be in happy state .</l>
   </lg>
   <note xml:id="note27" place="bottom" n="27">Variations of this incident are found in romances of all nations .</note>
   <p>Jack at once accepted the challenge , and putting the trumpet to his mouth , gave a blast that made the hills re-echo . The castle trembled to its foundations , and the giant and conjuror were overstricken with fear , knowing that the reign of their enchantments was at an end . The former was speedily slain by Jack , but the conjuror , mounting up into the air , was carried away in a whirlwind , and never heard of more . The enchantments were immediately broken , and all the lords and ladies , who had so long been cruelly transformed , were standing on the native earth in their natural shapes , the castle having vanished with the conjuror .</p>
   <p>The only relic of the giant which was left was the head , which Jack cut off in the first instance , and which we must suppose rolled away from the influence of the enchanted castle , or it would have “ vanished into thin air ” with the body . It was fortunate that it did so , for it proved an inestimable trophy at the court of King Arthur , where Jack the Giant-killer was shortly afterwards united to the duke 's daughter whom he had freed from enchantment , “ not only to the joy of the court , but of all the kingdom . ” To complete his happiness , he was endowed with a noble house and estates , and his penchant for giant-killing having subsided , or , what is more probable , no more monsters appearing to interrupt his tranquillity , he accomplished the usual conclusion to these romantic narratives , by passing the remainder of his life in the enjoyment of every domestic felicity .</p>
   <p>[ I have alluded to the quotation from this primitive romance made by Shakespeare in King Lear , but if the story of Rowland , published by Mr. Jamieson , is to be trusted , it would seem that the great dramatist was indebted to a ballad of the time . This position would , however , compel us to adopt the belief that the words of the giant are also taken from the ballad ; a supposition to which I am most unwilling to assent . In fact , I believe that Edgar quotes from two different compositions , the first line from a ballad on Rowland , the second from Jack and the Giants . “ And Rowland into the castle came ” is a line in the second ballad of Rosmer Hafmand , or the Merman Rosmer , in the Danish Koempe Viser , p. 165 . The story alluded to above may be briefly given as follows .</p>
   <p>The sons of King Arthur were playing at ball in the merry town of Carlisle , and their sister , “ Burd<span corresp="#note28" type="note_anchor">[ 28 ]</span>Ellen ” was in the midst of them . Now it happened that Child Rowland gave the ball such a powerful kick with his foot that “ o'er the kirk he gar 'd it flee . ” Burd Ellen went round about in search of the ball , but what was the consternation of her brothers when they found that she did not return , although “ they bade lang and ay langer , ” —</p>
   <note xml:id="note28" place="bottom" n="28">It is almost unnecessary to observe that burd was an ancient term for lady .</note>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">They sought her east , they sought her west ,</l>
     <l n="2">They sought her up and down ;</l>
     <l n="3">And wae were the hearts in merry Carlisle ,</l>
     <l n="4">For she was nae gait found .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>At last her eldest brother went to the Warlock or Wizard Merlin , and asked him if he knew where his sister , the fair Burd Ellen , was . “ The fair Burd Ellen , ” said the Warlock Merlin , “ is carried away by the fairies , and is now in the castle of the King of Elfland ; and it were too bold an undertaking for the stoutest knight in Christendom to bring her back . ” The brother , however , insisted upon undertaking the enterprise , and after receiving proper instructions from Merlin , which he failed in observing , he set out on his perilous expedition , and was never more seen .</p>
   <p>The other brothers took the same course , and shared a similar fate , till it came to the turn of Child Rowland , who with great difficulty obtained the consent of his mother , for Queen Guinever began to be afraid of losing all her children . Rowland , having received her blessing , girt on his father 's celebrated sword Excaliber , that never struck in vain , and repaired to Merlin 's cave . The wizard gave him all necessary instructions for his journey and conduct , the most important of which were that he should kill every person he met with after entering the land of Faerie , and should neither eat nor drink of what was offered him in that country , whatever his hunger or thirst might be ; for if he tasted or touched in Elfland , he must remain in the power of the elves , and never see middle-earth again .</p>
   <p>Child Rowland faithfully promised to observe the instructions of Merlin , and he accordingly went to Elfland , where he found , as the wizard had foretold , the king 's horseherd feeding his horses . “ Canst thou tell me , ” said Rowland , “ where the castle of the king of Elfland is ? ” “ I cannot , ” replied the horseherd , “ but go a little further , and thou wilt come to a cowherd , and perhaps he will know . ” When he had made this answer , Rowland , remembering his instructions , took his good sword , and cut off the head of the horseherd . He then went a little further , and met with a cowherd , to whom he repeated the same question , and obtained the same answer . Child Rowland then cut off the cowherd 's head , and having pursued exactly the same course with a shepherd , goatherd , and a swineherd , he is referred by the last to a hen-wife , who , in reply to his question , said , “ Go on yet a little farther till you come to a round green hill , surrounded with terraces from the bottom to the top : go round it three times widershins ,<span corresp="#note29" type="note_anchor">[ 29 ]</span>and every time say , “ Open door , open door , and let me come in ! ’ and the third time the door will open , and you may go in . ” Child Rowland immediately cut off the hen-wife 's head in return for her intelligence , and following her directions , a door in the hill opened , and he went in . As soon as he entered , the door closed behind him , and he traversed a long passage , which was dimly but pleasantly lighted by crystallized rock , till he came to two wide and lofty folding-doors , which stood ajar . He opened them , and entered an immense hall , which seemed nearly as big as the hill itself . It was the most magnificent apartment in all the land of Faerie , for the pillars were of gold and silver , and the keystones ornamented with clusters of diamonds . A gold chain hung from the middle of the roof , supporting an enormous lamp composed of one hollowed transparent pearl , in the midst of which was a large magical carbuncle that beautifully illumined the whole of the hall .</p>
   <note xml:id="note29" place="bottom" n="29">The contrary way to the course of the sun .</note>
   <p>At the upper end of the hall , seated on a splendid sofa , under a rich canopy , was his sister the Burd Ellen , “ kembing her yellow hair wi ’ a silver kemb , ” who immediately perceiving him , was sorrow-struck at the anticipation of his being destroyed by the king of Elfland ,—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And hear ye this , my youngest brither ,</l>
     <l n="2">Why badena ye not at hame ?</l>
     <l n="3">Had ye a hunder and thousand lives ,</l>
     <l n="4">Ye canna brook ane o ’ them .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And she informs him that he will certainly lose his life if the king finds him in the hall . A long conversation then takes place , and Rowland tells her all his adventures , concluding his narrative with the observation that , after his long journey , he is very hungry .</p>
   <p>On this the Burd Ellen shook her head , and looked sorrowfully at him ; but , impelled by her enchantment , she rose up , and procured him a golden bowl full of bread and milk . It was then that the Child Rowland remembered the instructions of the Warlock Merlin , and he passionately exclaimed , “ Burd Ellen , I will neither eat nor drink till I set thee free ! ” Immediately this speech was uttered , the folding-doors of the hall burst open with tremendous violence , and in came the king of Elfland ,—</p>

   <p>“ Strike , then , Bogle , if thou darest , ” exclaimed the undaunted Child Rowland , and a furious combat ensued , but Rowland , by the help of his good sword , conquered the elf-king , sparing his life on condition that he would restore to him his two brothers and sister . The king joyfully consented , and having disenchanted them by the anointment of a bright red liquor , they all four returned in triumph to merry Carlisle . ]</p>

    <head>TOM HICKATHRIFT .</head>
    <note>Tom Hickathrift belongs to the same series as Jack the Giant-killer , one of the popular corruptions of old northern romances . It seems to allude to some of the insurrections in the Isle of Ely , such as that of Hereward , described in Wright 's Essays , ii . 91 . Spelman , however , describes a tradition , which he says was credited by the inhabitants of Tylney , in which Hickifric appears as the assertor of the rights of their ancestors , and the means he employed on the occasion correspond with incidents in the following tale . The entire passage is worth transcription . “ In Marslandia sitae sunt Walsoka , Waltona , et Walpola . In viciniis jacent Terrington et St. Maries — adjacet Tylney veteris utique Tylneiorum familiae radix . Hic se expandit insignis area quae a planicie nuncupatur Tylney Smeeth , pinguis adeo et luxurians ut Paduana pascua videatur superasse . Tuentur eam indigenae velut aras et focos , fabellamque recitant longa petitam vetustate de Hickifrico ( nescio quo ) Haii illius instar in Scotorum Chronicis qui civium suorum dedignatus fuga , aratrum quod agebat solvit ; arreptoque temone furibundus insiliit in hostes victoriamque ademit exultantibus . Sic cum de agri istius possessione acriter olim dimicatum esset , inter fundi dominum et villarum incolas , nec valerent hi adversus eum consistere , redeuntibus occurrit Hickifrickus , axemque excutiens a curru quem agebat , eo vice gladii usus ; rota , clypei ; invasores repulit ad ipsos quibus nunc funguntur terminos . Ostendunt in coemeterio Tilniensi sepulchrum sui pugilis , axem cum rota insculptum exhibens . ” — Icenia , Descriptio Norfolciae , p. 138 .

   </lg>
   <p>In the reign before William the Conqueror , I have read in ancient history that there dwelt a man in the parish of the Isle of Ely , in the county of Cambridge , named Thomas Hickathrift , a poor labouring man , but so strong that he was able to do in one day the ordinary work of two . He had an only son , whom he christened Thomas , after his own name . The old man put his son “ to good learning , ” but he would take none , for he was , as we call them in this age , none of the wisest , but something soft , and had no docility at all in him . God calling this good man , the father , to his rest , his mother , being tender of him , maintained him by her hard labour as well as she could ; but this was no easy matter , for Tom would sit all day in the chimney-corner , instead of doing anything to assist her , and although at the period we are speaking of , he was only ten years old , he would eat more than four or five ordinary men , and was five feet and a half in height , and two feet and a half broad . His hand was more like a shoulder of mutton than a boy 's hand , and he was altogether like a little monster , “ but yet his great strength was not known . ”</p>
   <p>Tom 's strength came to be known in this manner . His mother , it appears , as well as himself , for they lived in the primitive days of merry old England , slept upon straw . This was in character with the wretched mud hovels then occupied by the labouring population , not half so good as many pigsties are now-a-days . Now being a tidy old creature , she must every now and then replenish her homely couch , and one day , having been promised a “ bottle ” of straw by a neighbouring farmer , after considerable entreaty , she prevailed on her son to go to fetch it . Tom , however , made her borrow a cart-rope first , before he would budge a step , without condescending to enter into any explanation respecting the use he intended it for ; and the poor woman , too glad to obtain his assistance on any terms , readily complied with his singular request . Tom , swinging the rope round his shoulders , went to the farmer 's , and found him with two men , thrashing in a barn . Having mentioned the object of his visit , the farmer somewhat inconsiderately told him he might take as much straw as he could carry . Tom immediately took him at his word , and , placing the rope in a right position , rapidly made up a bundle containing at least a cartload , the men jeering him on the absurdity of raising a pile they imagined no man could carry , and maliciously asking him if his rope was long enough . Their merriment , however , was not of long duration , for Tom flung the enormous bundle over his shoulders , and walked away with it without any apparent exertion , much to the astonishment and dismay of the master and his men .</p>
   <p>After this exploit , Tom was no longer suffered to enjoy his idle humours . Every one was endeavouring to secure his services , and we are told many remarkable tales of his extraordinary strength , still more wonderful than the one just related . On one occasion , having been offered as great a bundle of firewood as he could carry , he marched off with one of the largest trees in the forest ! Tom was also extremely fond of attending fairs ; and in cudgelling , wrestling , or throwing the hammer , there was no one who could compete with him . He thought nothing of flinging a huge hammer into the middle of a river a mile off , and in fact performed such extraordinary feats , that it was currently reported throughout the country he had dealings with the Evil One .</p>
   <p>Tom Hickathrift , too , was a very care-for-nothing fellow , and there were very few persons in all the Isle of Ely who dared to give him an ill word . Those who did paid very dearly for their impertinence , and Tom was , in fact , paramount over his companions . His great strength , however , caused him to be much sought after by those who were in want of efficient labour , and at length a brewer at Lynn , who required a strong , lusty fellow to carry his beer to the Marsh and to Wisbech , after much persuasion , and promising him a new suit of clothes , and as much as he liked to eat and drink , secured Tom for this purpose . The distance he daily travelled with the beer was upwards of twenty miles , for although there was a shorter cut through the Marsh , no one durst go that way for fear of a monstrous giant , who was lord of a portion of the district , and who killed or made slaves of every one he could lay his hands upon .</p>
   <p>Now in the course of time , Tom was thoroughly tired of going such a roundabout way , and without communicating his purpose to any one , he was resolved to pass through the giant 's domain , or lose his life in the attempt . This was a bold undertaking , but good living had so increased Tom 's strength and courage , that , venturesome as he was before , his hardiness was so much increased that he would have faced a still greater danger . He accordingly drove his cart in the forbidden direction , flinging the gates wide open , as if for the purpose of making his daring more conspicuous . At length he was espied by the giant , who was indignant at his boldness , but consoled himself with the reflection that Tom and the beer would soon become his prey . “ Sirrah , ” said the monster , “ who gave you permission to come this way ? Do you not know how I make all stand in fear of me ? and you , like an impudent rogue , must come and fling my gates open at your pleasure ! How dare you presume to do so ? Are you careless of your life ? Do not you care what you do ? But I will make you an example for all rogues under the sun ! Dost thou not see how many thousand heads hang upon yonder tree , heads of those who have offended against my laws ; but thy head shall hang higher than all the rest for an example ! ” But Tom made him this impudent answer , “ A dishclout in your teeth for your news , for you shall not find me to be one of them ! ” “ No ! ” said the giant , in astonishment and indignation ; “ and what a fool you must be if you come to fight with such a one as I am , and bring never a weapon to defend yourself ! ” Quoth Tom , “ I have a weapon here will make you know you are a traitorly rogue . ” This impertinent speech highly incensed the giant , who immediately ran to his cave for his club , intending to dash out Tom 's brains at one blow . Tom was now much distressed for a weapon , that necessary accoutrement in his expedition having by some means escaped his memory , and he began to reflect how very little his whip would avail him against a monster twelve feet in height , and six feet round the waist , small dimensions certainly for a giant , but sufficient to be formidable . But while the giant was gone for his club , Tom bethought himself , and turning his cart upside down , adroitly takes out the axletree , which would serve him for a staff , and removing a wheel , adapts it to his arm in lieu of a shield ; very good weapons indeed in time of trouble , and worthy of Tom 's ingenuity . When the monster returned with his club , he was amazed to see the weapons with which Tom had armed himself , but uttering a word of defiance , he bore down upon the poor fellow with such heavy strokes , that it was as much as Tom could do to defend himself with his wheel . Tom , however , at length managed to give the giant<span corresp="#note31" type="note_anchor">[ 31 ]</span>a heavy blow with the axletree on the side of his head , that he nearly reeled over . “ What ! ” said Tom , “ are you tipsy with my strong beer already ? ” This inquiry did not , as we may suppose , mollify the giant , who laid on his blows so sharply and heavily that Tom was obliged to act on the defensive . By and by , not making any impression on the wheel , he got almost tired out , and was obliged to ask Tom if he would let him drink a little , and then he would fight again . “ No , ” said Tom , “ my mother did not teach me that wit ; who would be fool then ? ” The sequel may readily be imagined , and Tom having beaten the giant , and , disregarding his supplications for mercy , cut off his head , entered the cave , which he found completely filled with gold and silver .</p>
   <note xml:id="note31" place="bottom" n="31">In the original it is lent the giant , the term lent being old English or Saxon for gave . The expression sufficiently proves the antiquity of the version .</note>
   <p>The news of this celebrated victory rapidly spread throughout the country , for the giant had been a common enemy to the inhabitants . They made bonfires for joy , and testified their respect to Tom by every means in their power . A few days afterwards , Tom took possession of the cave and all the giant 's treasure . He pulled down the former , and built a magnificent house on the spot ; but with respect to the land forcibly obtained by the giant , part of it he gave to the poor for their common , merely reserving enough to maintain himself and his good old mother , Jane Hickathrift . His treasure , we may suppose , notwithstanding this great liberality , enabled him to maintain a noble establishment , for he is represented as having numbers of servants , and a magnificent park of deer . He also built a famous church , which was called St. James 's , because it was on that saint 's day that he had killed the giant . And what was as good and better than all this , he was no longer called Tom Hickathrift by the people , but “ Mr. Hickathrift , ” a title then implying a greater advancement in social position that can now scarcely be imagined .</p>
   <p>Like many other persons who have become suddenly possessed of great wealth , Tom was sadly at a loss to know what to do with his money ; nor does this sage history condescend to inform us in what manner he expended it . He seems , however , to have amused himself rarely , attending every sport he could hear of for miles round , cracking skulls at cudgel-playing , bear-baiting , and all the gentlemanly recreations current in those days . At football he could scarcely have been a welcome addition to the company , for one kick from his foot , if he caught it in the middle , was sure to send the ball so great a distance over hedges and trees that it was never seen again . Tom was , also , one evening attacked by four robbers ; but they sadly mistook the person they had to deal with , for he quickly killed two of them , made the others sue for mercy , and carried off their booty , which amounted to the large sum of two hundred pounds . One would have thought the Hickathrifts were wealthy enough before , but this addition to their store was , somehow or other , a source of great delight and merriment to Tom 's aged mother .</p>
   <p>Tom was a long time before he found any one that could match him ; but , one day , going through his woods , he met with a lusty tinker , who had a great staff on his shoulder , and a large dog to carry his bag and tools . Tom was not particularly courteous ; it may readily be supposed that his unvarying successes had made him rather overbearing ; and he somewhat rudely asked the tinker what was his business there . But the tinker was no man to succumb , and as rudely answered , “ What 's that to you ? Fools must needs be meddling ! ” A quarrel was soon raised , and the two laid on in good earnest , blow for blow , till the wood re-echoed with their strokes . The issue of the contest was long doubtful , but , the tinker was so persevering , that Tom confessed he was fairly vanquished ; and they then went home together , and were sworn brothers in arms ever afterwards . It happened , from the events that followed , to be a fortunate occurrence .</p>
   <p>In and about the Isle of Ely , many disaffected persons , to the number of ten thousand and upwards , drew themselves up in a body , presuming to contend for their ancient rights and liberties , insomuch that the gentry and civil magistrates of the county were in great danger . The danger was so great , that the sheriff was obliged to come to Tom Hickathrift , under cover of the night , for shelter and protection , and gave him a full account of the rebellion . The tinker and Tom immediately promised their assistance , and they went out as soon as it was day , armed with their clubs , the sheriff conducting them to the rendezvous of the rebels . When they arrived there , Tom and the tinker marched up to the leaders of the multitude , and asked them the reason of their disturbing the government . To this they answered loudly , “ Our will is our law , and by that alone will we be governed . ” “ Nay , ” quoth Tom , “ if it be so , these trusty clubs are our weapons , and by them alone you shall be chastised . ” These words were no sooner uttered , than they madly rushed on the immense multitude , bearing all before them , laying twenty or thirty sprawling with every blow . It is also related , as something rather remarkable , that the tinker struck a tall man on the nape of the neck with such immense force that his head flew off , and was carried forty feet from the body with such violence that it knocked down one of the chief ringleaders , killing him on the spot . The feats of Tom were no less wonderful ; for , after having slain hundreds , and at length broke his club , he seized upon “ a lusty rawboned miller ” as a substitute , and made use of him as a weapon , till he had quite cleared the field .</p>
   <p>The king of course received intelligence of these extraordinary exploits , and sent for the two heroes to his palace , where a royal banquet was prepared for their honour and entertainment , most of the nobility being present . Now after the banquet was over , the king made a speech , neither too short nor too long , but having the extraordinary merit of being much to the purpose . We cannot omit so remarkable a specimen of royal eloquence . “ These , my guests , ” said the king , “ are my trusty and well-beloved subjects , men of approved courage and valour ; they are the men that overcame and conquered ten thousand rebels who were combined for the purpose of disturbing the peace of my realm . According to the character I have received of Thomas Hickathrift and Henry Nonsuch , my two worthy guests here present , they cannot be matched in any other kingdom in the world . Were it possible to have an army of twenty thousand such as these , I dare venture to assert I would act the part of Alexander the Great over again . In the meanwhile , as a proof of my royal favour , kneel down , Thomas Hickathrift , and receive the ancient order of knighthood . And with respect to Henry Nonsuch , I will settle upon him , as a reward for his great services , the sum of forty shillings a year for life . ” After the delivery of this excellent address , the king retired , and Tom and Henry shortly afterwards took their departure , attended for many miles by a portion of the court .</p>
   <p>When Sir Thomas Hickathrift returned home , he found , to his great sorrow , that his mother had died during his stay at the court . It can scarcely be said that he was inconsolable for her loss , but being “ left alone in a large and spacious house , he found himself strange and uncouth . ” He therefore began to consider whether it would not be advisable to seek out for a wife , and hearing of a wealthy young widow not far from Cambridge , he went and paid his addresses to her . At his first coming , she appeared to favour his suit , but , before he paid her a second visit , her fancy had been attracted by a more elegant wooer , and Sir Thomas actually found him at her feet . The young spark , relying on the lady 's favour , was vehemently abusive to the knight , calling him a great lubberly whelp , a brewer 's servant , and a person altogether unfitted to make love to a lady . Sir Thomas was not a likely man to allow such an affront to go unpunished , so going out in the courtyard with the dandy to settle the matter , he gave him a kick which sent him over the tops of the houses into a pond some distance off , where he would have been drowned , had not a poor shepherd , passing by , pulled him out with his crook .</p>
   <p>The gallant studied every means of being revenged upon the knight , and for this purpose engaged two troopers to lie in ambush for him . Tom , however , according to the story , “ crushed them like cucumbers . "[ 32 ] Even when he was going to church with his bride to be married , he was set upon by one-and-twenty ruffians in armour ; but , borrowing a back-sword from one of the company , he laid about him with such dexterity , that , purposely desiring not to kill any one , at every blow he chopped off a leg or an arm , the ground being strewed with the relics , “ as it is with tiles from the tops of the houses after a dreadful storm . ” His intended and friends were mightily amused at all this , and the fair one jokingly observed , “ What a splendid lot of cripples he has made in the twinkling of an eye ! ” Sir Thomas only received a slight scratch , and he consoled himself for the trifling misfortune by the conviction he had only lost a drop of blood for every limb he had chopped off .</p>
   <note xml:id="note32" place="bottom" n="32">The author is not very particular in his similes , but this appears to be quite peculiar to this history .</note>
   <p>The marriage ceremony took place without any further adventure , and Sir Thomas gave a great feast on the occasion , to which all the poor widows for miles round were invited in honour of his deceased mother , and it lasted for four days , in memory of the four last victories he had obtained . The only occurrence at this feast worth mentioning was the theft of a silver cup , which was traced to the possession of an old woman of the name of Stumbelup ,<span corresp="#note33" type="note_anchor">[ 33 ]</span>and the others were so disgusted at her ingratitude to their kind host , that she would have been hanged on the spot , had not Sir Thomas interfered , and undertook the appointment of the punishment . Nor was it otherwise than comical , for she was condemned to be drawn through all the streets and lanes of Cambridge on a wheelbarrow , holding a placard in her hands , which informed the public ,—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">I am the naughty Stumbelup ,</l>
     <l n="2">Who tried to steal the silver cup .</l>

   <p>The news of Tom 's wedding soon reached the court , and the king , remembering his eminent services , immediately invited him and his lady , who visited their sovereign immediately , and were received by him most affectionately . While they were on this visit , intelligence arrived that an extraordinary invasion had taken place in the county of Kent . A huge giant riding on a dragon , and accompanied with a large number of bears and lions , had landed on the coast of that unfortunate county , and was ravaging it in all directions . The king , says the history , was “ a little startled , ” and well he might be , at such a visitation ; but , taking advantage of the opportune presence of Tom Hickathrift , he solved the difficulty by creating him governor of the Isle of Thanet ,<span corresp="#note34" type="note_anchor">[ 34 ]</span>and thus making him responsible for the protection of the inhabitants from this terrible monster .</p>
   <note xml:id="note34" place="bottom" n="34">In the heading of the chapter in the original it is East Angles , now called the Isle of Thanet , an error which favours the supposition of the story having been adapted from a much older original .</note>
   <p>There was a castle in the island , from which the country was visible for miles round , and this was the governor 's abode . He had not been there long before he caught a view of the giant , who is described as “ mounted upon a dreadful dragon , with an iron club upon his shoulders , having but one eye , the which was placed in his forehead ; this eye was larger in compass than a barber 's bason , and appeared like a flame of fire ; his visage was dreadful to behold , grim and tawny ; the hair of his head hung down his back and shoulders like snakes of an enormous length ; and the bristles of his beard were like rusty wire ! ” It is difficult to imagine a being more terrible than this , but Tom was only surprised , not frightened , when he saw one day the giant making his way to the castle on his formidable dragon . After he had well viewed the edifice with his glaring eye , he tied the dragon up to a tree , and went up to the castle as if he had intended to thrust it down with his shoulder . But somehow or other he managed to slip down , so that he could not extricate himself , and Tom , advancing with his two-handed sword , cut off the giant 's head at one blow , and the dragon 's at four , and sent them up in a “ waggon ” to the court of his sovereign .</p>
   <p>The news of Tom 's victories reached the ears of his old companion , the tinker , who became desirous of sharing in his glory , and accordingly joined him at his castle . After mutual congratulations , Tom informed him of his wish to destroy , without delay , the beasts of prey that infested the island . They started for this purpose in company , Tom armed with his two-handed sword , and the tinker with his long pikestaff . After they had travelled about four or five hours , it was their fortune to meet with the whole knot of wild beasts together , being in number fourteen , six bears and eight lions . The two heroes waited for them with their backs against a tree , and whenever they came “ within cutting distance ” they cut their heads off , and in this manner killed all but one lion , who , unfortunately , by an inconsiderate movement on the part of Tom , crushed the poor tinker to death . The animal was , however , ultimately slain by Sir Thomas .</p>
   <p>Sir Thomas Hickathrift had killed the giants , dragon , and lions , and he had conquered the rebels , but his happiness was by no means completed , for he was inconsolate for the loss of his friend . He , however , returned home to his lady , and made a grand feast in commemoration of his important victories . The history terminates with the following brilliant metrical speech he made on this festive occasion :</p>

    <head>TOM THUMB .</head>
    <head>[ Thumb stories are common in German and Danish , and the English tale comprises much that is found in the Northern versions . A writer in the Quarterly Review , xxi . 100 , enters into some speculations respecting the mythological origin of Tom Thumb , and records his persuasion , in which we agree , that several of our common nursery tales are remnants of ancient {~ GREEK SMALL LETTER MU ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA ~}. Sir W. Scott mentions the Danish popular history of Svend Tomling , analysed by Nierup , “ a man no bigger than a thumb , who would be married to a woman three ells and three quarters long . ” This personage is probably commemorated in the nursery rhyme ,</head>
     <l n="1">I had a little husband</l>
     <l n="2">No bigger than my thumb :</l>
     <l n="3">I put him in a pint-pot ,</l>
     <l n="4">And there I bid him drum .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>According to popular tradition , Tom Thumb died at Lincoln , and a little blue flagstone in the pavement of the cathedral used to be pointed out as his monument .</p>
   <p>“ It was my good fortune , ” says Dr. Wagstaffe , “ some time ago , to have the library of a schoolboy committed to my charge , where , among other undiscovered valuable authors , I pitched upon Tom Thumb and Tom Hickathrift , authors indeed more proper to adorn the shelves of Bodley or the Vatican , than to be confined to the retirement and obscurity of a private study . I have perused the first of these with an infinite pleasure , and a more than ordinary application , and have made some observations on it , which may not , I hope , prove unacceptable to the public , and however it may have been ridiculed and looked upon as an entertainment only for children and those of younger years , may be found perhaps a performance not unworthy the perusal of the judicious , and the model superior to either of those incomparable poems of Chevy Chase or the Children in the Wood . The design was undoubtedly to recommend virtue , and to show that however any one may labour under the disadvantages of stature and deformity , or the meanness of parentage , yet if his mind and actions are above the ordinary level , those very disadvantages that seem to depress him add a lustre to his character . ” — A Comment upon the History of Tom Thumb , 1711 , p . 4 . ]</p>
   <p>In the merry days of good King Arthur , there lived in one of the counties of England a ploughman and his wife . They were poor , but as the husband was a strong workman , and his partner an able assistant in all matters pertaining to the farmhouse , the dairy , and poultry , they managed to make a very good living , and would have been contented and happy , had Nature blessed them with any offspring . But although they had been married several years , no olive branch had yet appeared , and the worthy couple sadly lamented their hard lot .</p>
   <p>There lived at this period , at the court of Arthur , a celebrated conjuror and magician , whose name was Merlin , the astonishment of the whole world , for he knew the past , present , and future , and nothing appeared impossible to him . Persons of all classes solicited his assistance and advice , and he was perfectly accessible to the humblest applicant . Aware of this , the ploughman , after a long consultation with his “ better half , ” determined to consult him , and , for this purpose , travelled to the court , and , with tears in his eyes , beseeched Merlin that he might have a child , “ even though it should be no bigger than his thumb . ”</p>
   <p>Now Merlin had a strange knack of taking people exactly at their words , and without waiting for any more explicit declaration of the ploughman 's wishes , at once granted his request . What was the poor countryman 's astonishment to find , when he reached home , that his wife had given birth to a gentleman so diminutive , that it required a strong exercise of the vision to see him . His growth was equally wonderful , for —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">In four minutes he grew so fast ,</l>
     <l n="2">That he became as tall</l>
     <l n="3">As was the ploughman 's thumb in length ,</l>
     <l n="4">And so she did him call .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The christening of this little fellow was a matter of much ceremony , for the fairy queen , attended by all her company of elves , was present at the rite , and he formally received the name of Tom Thumb . Her majesty and attendants attired him with their choicest weeds , and his costume is worth a brief notice . His hat was made of a beautiful oak leaf ; his shirt was composed of a fine spider 's web , and his hose and doublet of thistle-down . His stockings were made with the rind of a delicate green apple , and the garters were two of the finest little hairs one can imagine , plucked from his mother 's eyebrows . Shoes made of the skin of a little mouse , “ and tanned most curiously , ” completed his fairy-like accoutrement .</p>
   <p>It may easily be imagined that Tom was an object of astonishment and ridicule amongst the other children of the village , but they soon discovered that , notwithstanding his diminutive size , he was more than a match for them . It was a matter of very little consequence to Tom whether he lost or won , for if he found his stock of counters or cherrystones run low , he soon crept into the pockets of his companions , and replenished his store . It happened , on one occasion , that he was detected , and the aggrieved party punished Tom by shutting him up in a pin-box . The fairy boy was sadly annoyed at his imprisonment , but the next day he amply revenged himself ; for hanging a row of glasses on a sunbeam , his companions thought they would follow his example , and , not possessing Tom 's fairy gifts , broke the glasses , and were severely whipped , whilst the little imp was overjoyed at their misfortune , standing by , and laughing till the tears run down his face .</p>
   <p>The boys were so irritated with the trick that had been played upon them , that Tom 's mother was afraid to trust him any longer in their company . She accordingly kept him at home , and made him assist her in any light work suitable for so small a child . One day , while she was making a batter-pudding , Tom stood on the edge of the bowl , with a lighted candle in his hand , so that she might see it was properly made . Unfortunately , however , when her back was turned , Tom accidentally fell in the bowl , and his mother not missing him , stirred him up in the pudding “ instead of minced fat , ” and put the pudding in the kettle with Tom in it . The poor woman paid dearly for her mistake , for Tom had no sooner felt the warm water , than he danced about like mad , and the pudding jumped about till she was nearly frightened out of her wits , and was glad to give it to a tinker who happened to be passing that way . He was thankful for a present so acceptable , and anticipated the pleasure of eating a better dinner than he had enjoyed for many a long day . But his joy was of short duration , for as he was getting over a stile , he happened to sneeze very hard , and Tom , who had hitherto remained silent , cried out , “ Hollo , Pickens ! ” which so terrified the tinker , that he threw the pudding into the field , and scampered away as fast as ever he could go . The pudding tumbled to pieces with the fall , and Tom , creeping out , went home to his mother , who had been in great affliction on account of his absence .</p>
   <p>A few days after this adventure , Tom accompanied his mother when she went into the fields to milk the cows , and for fear he should be blown away by the wind , she tied him to a thistle with a small piece of thread . While in this position , a cow came by , and swallowed him up :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">But , being missed , his mother went ,</l>
     <l n="2">Calling him everywhere :</l>
     <l n="3">Where art thou , Tom ? where art thou , Tom ?</l>
     <l n="4">Quoth he , Here , mother , here !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Within the red cow 's stomach , here</l>
     <l n="6">Your son is swallowed up ;</l>
     <l n="7">All which within her fearful heart</l>
     <l n="8">Much woful dolour put .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The cow , however , was soon tired of her subject , for Tom kicked and scratched till the poor animal was nearly mad , and at length tumbled him out of her mouth , when he was caught by his mother , and carried safely home .</p>
   <p>A succession of untoward accidents followed . One day , Tom 's father took him to the fields a-ploughing , and gave him “ a whip made of a barley straw ” to drive the oxen with , but the dwarf was soon lost in a furrow . While he was there , a great raven came and carried him an immense distance to the top of a giant 's castle . The giant soon swallowed him up , but he made such a disturbance when he got inside , that the monster was soon glad to get rid of him , and threw the mischievous little imp full three miles into the sea . But he was not drowned , for he had scarcely reached the water before he was swallowed by a huge fish , which was shortly after captured , and sent to King Arthur by the fisherman for a new-year 's gift . Tom was now discovered , and at once adopted by the king as his dwarf ;</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Long time he liv 'd in jollity ,</l>
     <l n="2">Belov 'd of the court ,</l>
     <l n="3">And none like Tom was so esteem 'd</l>
     <l n="4">Amongst the better sort .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The queen was delighted with the little dwarf , and made him dance a galliard on her left hand . His performance was so satisfactory , that King Arthur gave him a ring which he wore about his middle like a girdle ; and he literally “ crept up the royal sleeve , ” requesting leave to visit his parents , and take them as much money as he could carry :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And so away goes lusty Tom</l>
     <l n="2">With threepence at his back ,</l>
     <l n="3">A heavy burthen , which did make</l>
     <l n="4">His very bones to crack .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Tom remained three days with the old couple , and feasted upon a hazel-nut so extravagantly that he grew ill. His indisposition was not of long continuance , and Arthur was so anxious for the return of his dwarf , that his mother took a birding-trunk , and blew him to the court . He was received by the king with every demonstration of affection and delight , and tournaments were immediately proclaimed :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Thus he at tilt and tournament</l>
     <l n="2">Was entertained so ,</l>
     <l n="3">That all the rest of Arthur 's knights</l>
     <l n="4">Did him much pleasure show .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">And good Sir Launcelot du Lake ,</l>
     <l n="6">Sir Tristram and Sir Guy ,</l>
     <l n="7">Yet none compar 'd to brave Tom Thumb</l>
     <l n="8">In acts of chivalry .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Tom , however , paid dearly for his victories , for the exertions he made upon this celebrated occasion threw him into an illness which ultimately occasioned his death . But the hero was carried away by his godmother , the fairy queen , into the land of Faerie , and after the lapse of two centuries , he was suffered to return to earth , and again amuse men by his comical adventures . On one occasion , after his return from fairy-land , he jumped down a miller 's throat , and played all manner of pranks on the poor fellow , telling him of all his misdeeds , for millers in former days were the greatest rogues , as everybody knows , that ever lived . A short time afterwards , Tom a second time is swallowed by a fish , which is caught , and set for sale at the town of Rye , where a steward haggles for it ,—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Amongst the rest the steward came ,</l>
     <l n="2">Who would the salmon buy ,</l>
     <l n="3">And other fish that he did name ,</l>
     <l n="4">But he would not comply .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The steward said , You are so stout ,</l>
     <l n="6">If so , I 'll not buy any .</l>
     <l n="7">So then bespoke Tom Thumb aloud ,</l>
     <l n="8">“ Sir , give the other penny ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">At this they began to stare ,</l>
     <l n="10">To hear this sudden joke :</l>
     <l n="11">Nay , some were frighted to the heart ,</l>
     <l n="12">And thought the dead fish spoke .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">So the steward made no more ado ,</l>
     <l n="14">But bid a penny more ;</l>
     <l n="15">Because , he said , I never heard</l>
     <l n="16">A fish to speak before .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The remainder of the history , which details Tom 's adventures with the queen , his coach drawn by six beautiful white mice , his escaping on the back of a butterfly , and his death in a spider 's web , is undoubtedly a later addition to the original , and may therefore be omitted in this analysis . It is , in fact , a very poor imitation of the first part of the tale .</p>
   <p>III .— GAME-RHYMES .</p>
   <p>The most obvious method of arranging the rhymes employed in the amusements of children is to commence with the simple lines used by the nurse in the infantine toe , finger , and face-games , then proceeding to bo-peep , and concluding with the more complicated games , many of the latter possessing a dramatic character .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>TOE-GAMES</head>
     <l n="1">Harry Whistle , Tommy Thistle ,</l>
     <l n="2">Harry Whible , Tommy Thible ,</l>
     <l n="3">And little Oker-bell .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>A game with the five toes , each toe being touched in succession as these names are cried . “ This song affords a proof of the connexion between the English and Scandinavian rhymes . The last line , as it now stands , appears to mean nothing . The word oker , however , is the A. - S. aecer , Icel . akr , Dan . ager , and Swed . aker , pronounced oker , a field , and the flower is the field-bell . ” — Mr. Stephens 's MS . The following lines are also used in a play with the toes :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Shoe the colt , shoe !</l>
     <l n="2">Shoe the wild mare !</l>
     <l n="3">Put a sack on her back ,</l>
     <l n="4">See if she 'll bear .</l>
     <l n="5">If she 'll bear ,</l>
     <l n="6">We 'll give her some grains ;</l>
     <l n="7">If she wo n't bear ,</l>
     <l n="8">We 'll dash out her brains .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">There are many various versions of this song in English , and it also</l>
     <l n="10">exists in Danish ( Thiele , iii . 133 ) .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">

   <p>Perhaps , however , this will be considered more like the common rhyme , “ Robert Barnes , Fellow fine , ” printed in the ‘ Nursery Rhymes of England , ’ p. 166 .

    <head>THE FIVE FINGERS .</head>
    <head>I do not recollect to have seen anywhere noticed the somewhat singular fact , that our ancestors had distinct names for each of the five fingers — the thumb being generally called a finger in old works . Yet such was the case ; and it may not displease the reader to have these cognominations duly set forth in order , viz . thumb , toucher , longman , leche-man , little-man . This information is derived from a very curious MS. quoted in my Dictionary of Archaisms , p. 357 ; and the reasons for the names are thus set forth :— The first finger was called toucher because “ therewith men touch i-wis ; ” the second finger longman , “ for longest finger it is , ” ( this , I beg to say , is intended for rhyme ) . The third finger was called leche-man , because a leche or doctor tasted everything by means of it . This is very curious ; though we find elsewhere another reason for this appellation , on account of the pulsation in it , which was at one time supposed to communicate directly with the heart . The other finger was , of course , called littleman because it was the least of all . It is rather curious that some of these names should have survived the wrecks of time , and be still preserved in a nursery-rhyme ; yet such is the fact ; for one thus commences , the fingers being kept in corresponding movements :</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Dance , thumbkin , dance ,</l>
     <l n="2">Dance , thumbkin , dance ;</l>
     <l n="3">Dance , ye merry men all around :</l>
     <l n="4">But thumbkin he can dance alone ;</l>
     <l n="5">But thumbkin he can dance alone .</l>

     <l n="9">But thumbkin he can dance alone ;</l>
     <l n="10">But thumbkin he can dance alone .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>And so on , substituting in succession middleone , longman , or middleman , ringman , and littleman , and each verse terminating with “ thumbkin he can dance alone . ” In some instances the original name for the third finger , lecheman , is preserved in the rhyme , but ringman is most generally adopted .</p>
   <p>It is worthy of remark too , that there is , even at the present day , amongst many of the old women of the Peak of Derbyshire , a strong belief in the superiority of lecheman over foreman in all matters of taste . They say that the forefinger is venomous , and that the superiority of the third is to be ascribed to its being possessed of a nerve ; and as they appear to pay a most superstitious reverence to a nerve , whether in the finger , the tooth , or the ear , they do not fail to impress upon their daughters the importance of tasting anything of consequence with the third finger .</p>
   <p>The names given to the fingers vary considerably in the different counties . In Essex they call them</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The children 's game of bo-peep is as old as the hills , hiding from each</l>

     <l n="4">Now 's the time for hide and seek .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>But in ancient times the amusement appears to have been even of a simpler character , and adopted by nurses before children are capable of seeking recreation for themselves . Sherwood describes bo-peep as a child 's game , in which the nurse conceals the head of the infant for an instant , and then removes the covering quickly . The Italians say far bau bau , or baco , baco , which Douce thinks is sufficient to show a connexion between the nurse 's boggle or buggy-bo , and the present expression . Shakespeare has condescended to notice the game , unless , indeed , we suppose the term to have passed into a proverb . The reader will recollect what Butler says of Sir Edward Kelly , the celebrated conjuror ,—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Kelly did all his feats upon</l>

   </lg>
   <p>The term bo-peep appears to have been connected at a very early period with sheep . Thus in an old ballad of the time of Queen Elizabeth , in a MS. in the library of Corpus Christi College , Cambridge ,—</p>

I regret I have nothing better , certainly nothing so ingenious , to offer to my philological readers . Letting that pass , I take the opportunity of giving an anecdote respecting Ben Jonson and Randolph , which affords another illustration of the analogy above mentioned . It is taken from a manuscript of the seventeenth century , in the possession of Mr. Stephens of Stockholm , who considers the volume to have been transcribed before the year 1650 .</p>
   <p>“ Randolph havinge not soe much as ferry money , sought out Ben Johnson , and comminge to a place in London where he and three more were drinkinge , peeps in att the chamber doore . Ben Johnson espyinge him , said , ‘ Come in , Jack Bo-peepe . ’ Randolph , beinge very thirsty , it beeing then summer , and willinge to quench his thirst , willingly obeyed his command . The company dranke untill it came to five shillings : every man drawinge his money , Randolph made this motion , viz . that he that made the first coppy of verses upon the reckoninge should goe scot-free .

   <p>SLATE GAMES .</p>
   <p>Entertaining puzzles or exercises upon the slate are generally great favorites with children . A great variety of them are current in the nursery , or rather were so some years ago . The story of the four rich men , the four poor men , and the pond , was one of these ; the difficulty merely requiring a zig-zag inclosure to enable it to be satisfactorily solved .</p>
   <p>Once upon a time there was a pond lying upon common land , which was extremely commodious for fishing , bathing , and various other purposes . Not far from it lived four poor men , to whom it was of great service ; and farther off , there lived four rich men . The latter envied the poor men the use of the pond , and , as inclosure bills had not then come into fashion , they wished to invent an inclosure-wall which should shut out the poor men from the pond , although they lived so near it , and still give free access to the rich men , who resided at a greater distance . How was this done ?</p>
   <p>GAME OF THE CAT .</p>
   <p>This is another slate game , in which , by means of a tale and appropriate indications on the slate , a rude figure of a cat is delineated . It requires , however , some little ingenuity to accomplish it .</p>
   <p>Tommy would once go to see his cousin Charles . [ Here one draws T for Tommy , and C for Charles , forming the forehead , nose , and mouth of the cat . ] But before he went , he would make walls to his house . [ Here he draws lines from the arms of the T to its foot , forming the cheeks of the cat . ] But then it smoked , and he would put chimneys to it . [ Here he inserts two narrow triangles on each arm of the T , forming the ears of the cat . ] But then it was so dark , he would put windows into it . [ Here he draws a small circle under each arm of the T , forming the eyes . ] Then to make it pretty , he would spread grass at the door . [ Here he scratches lines at the foot of the T , representing the cat 's whiskers . ] Then away he went on his journey , but after a little while , down he fell . [ Here he draws down a line a little way from the foot of the T .] But he soon climbed up again . [ Here he draws a zig-zag horizontally from the foot of the last line , and draws one up , forming with the last movement the first foot of the cat . ] Then he walks along again , but soon falls down once more . [ Here he draws a short horizontal line , and one downwards . ] He soon , however , got up again , as before , &amp; c. [ The second leg is then formed , and by similar movements the four legs of the cat appear . ] After thus falling down four times , Tommy determined to proceed more firmly , and climbing up , he walks along [ the back of the cat ] another way round till he comes to C. His journey is now accomplished , and an animal , called by courtesy a cat , appears on the slate , “ the admiration of all beholders . ”</p>

   <p>The party addressed either touches one hand , or guesses in which one the article ( whatever it may be ) is placed . If he guesses rightly , he wins its contents ; if wrongly , he loses an equivalent .</p>
   <p>Some versions read handy-pandy in the first of these , with another variation , that would not now be tolerated . This is one of the oldest English games in existence , and appears to be alluded to in Piers Ploughman , ed . Wright , p. 69 :</p>

   <p>Florio , in his World of Worlds , ed . 1611 , p. 57 , translates bazziciure , “ to shake between two hands , to play handie-dandie . ” Miege , in his Great French Dictionary , 1688 , says , “ Handy-dandy , a kind of play with the hands , sorte de jeu de main ; ” and Douce , ii . 167 , quotes an early MS ., which thus curiously mentions the game : “ They hould safe your children 's patrymony , and play with your majestie , as men play with little children at handye-dandye , which hand will you have , when they are disposed to keep anythinge from them . ” Some of the commentators on Shakespeare have mistaken the character of the game , from having adopted Coles 's erroneous interpretation of micare digitis . Sometimes the game is played by a sort of sleight of hand , changing the article rapidly from one hand into the other , so that the looker-on is often deceived , and induced to name the hand into which it is apparently thrown . This is what Shakespeare alludes to by changing places .</p>
   <p>Pope , in his Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus , says that the game of handy-dandy is mentioned by Plato ; but if , as I suppose , he refers to a well-known passage in the Lysis , the allusion appears somewhat too indistinct to warrant such an assertion ,—{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER

   <p>One would have thought that this tiresome repetition had been continued quite long enough , but two other verses are sometimes added , introducing gentlemen and ladies with the same questions , to both of which it is unnecessary to say that the callous and hardhearted Mary Brown replies with perfect indifference and want of curiosity .

   <p>The Swedish ballad of the “ Maiden that was sold into Slavery , ” has a similar dramatic character . ( See an article by Mr. Stephens , on the Popular Ballads and Songs of Sweden , in the Foreign Quarterly Review for 1840 . ) Another Swedish ballad , or ring-dance song , entitled , “ Fair Gundela , ” is , however , more analogous to the above . A girl sits on a stool or chair within a ring of dancers ; and , with something in her hands , imitates the action of rowing . She should have a veil on her head , and at the news of her sweetheart 's death , let it fall over her face , and sink down , overwhelmed with sorrow . The ring of girls dance round her , singing and pausing , and she sings in reply . The dialogue is conducted in the following manner :</p>
   <p>The Ring .</p>
   <p>Why row ye so , why row ye so ? Fair Gundela !</p>
   <p>Gundela .</p>

   <p>The veil is thrown on one side , her face beams with joy , the circle is broken , and the juvenile drama concludes with merriment and noise . It is difficult to say whether this is the real prototype of the English game , or whether they are both indebted to a still more primitive original . There is a poetical sweetness and absolute dramatic fervour in the Swedish ballad we vainly try to discover in the English version . In the latter , all is vulgar , common-place , and phlegmatic . Cannot we trace in both the national character ? Do we not see in the last that poetic simplicity which has made the works of Andersen so popular and irresistibly charming ? It may be that the style pleases by contrast , and that we appreciate its genuine chasteness the more , because we have nothing similar to it in our own vernacular literature .</p>

    <head>HEWLEY-PULEY .</head>
    <head>The children are seated and the following questions put by one of the party , holding a twisted handkerchief or something of the sort in the hand . The handkerchief was called hewley-puley , and the questions are asked by the child who holds it . If one answered wrongly , a box on the ear with the handkerchief was the consequence ; but if they all replied correctly , then the one who broke silence first had that punishment .</head>
     <l n="1">Take this ! What 's this ?— Hewley-puley .</l>

    <head>THE DIAMOND RING .</head>
    <head>Children sit in a ring or in a line , with their hands placed together palm to palm , and held straight , the little fingers downmost between the knees . One of them is then chosen to represent a servant , who takes a ring , or some other small article as a substitute , between her two palms , which are pressed flat together like those of the rest , and goes round the circle or line , placing her hands into the hands of every player , so that she is enabled to let the ring fall wherever she pleases without detection . After this , she returns to the first child she touched , and with her hands behind her exclaims ,—</head>
     <l n="1">My lady 's lost her diamond ring :</l>
     <l n="2">I pitch upon you to find it !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The child who is thus addressed must guess who has the ring , and the servant performs the same ceremony with each of the party . They who guess right , escape ; but the rest forfeit . Should any one in the ring exclaim , “ I have it , ” she also forfeits ; nor must the servant make known who has the ring , until all have guessed , under the same penalty . The forfeits are afterwards cried as usual .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE POOR SOLDIER .</head>
    <head>Children form a half-circle , first choosing one of their number to represent the poor soldier . The chief regulation is that none of the players may use the words , yes , no , black , white , or gray . The poor soldier traverses the semicircle , thus addressing each player ,—</head>
     <l n="1">Here 's a poor soldier come to town !</l>
     <l n="2">Have you aught to give him ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The answer must of course be evasive , else there is a fine . He continues , “ Have you a pair of trousers [ or old coat , shoes , cap , &amp; c .] to give me ? ” The answer must again be evasive , or else another forfeit . The old soldier then asks : “ Well , what colour is it ? ” The reply must avoid the forbidden colours , or another forfeit is the penalty . Great ingenuity may be exhibited in the manner in which the questions and answers are constructed , and , in the hands of some children , this is a most amusing recreation . The forfeits are of course cried at the end of the game .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE BRAMBLE-BUSH .</head>
    <head>A ring-dance imitation-play , the metrical portion of which is not without a little melody . The bramble-bush is often imaginative , but sometimes represented by a child in the centre of the ring . All join hands , and dance round in a circle , singing ,—</head>
     <l n="1">Here we go round the bramble-bush ,</l>
     <l n="2">— The bramble-bush , the bramble-bush :</l>
     <l n="3">Here we go round the bramble-bush</l>
     <l n="4">On a cold frosty morning !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>After the chanting of this verse is ended , all the children commence an imitation of washing clothes , making appropriate movements with their hands , and saying ,—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">This is the way we wash our clothes ,</l>
     <l n="2">— Wash our clothes , wash our clothes :</l>
     <l n="3">This is the way we wash our clothes</l>
     <l n="4">On a cold frosty morning !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>They then dance round , repeating the first stanza , after which the operation of drying the clothes is commenced with a similar verse , “ This is the way we dry our clothes , ” &amp; c. The game may be continued almost ad infinitum by increasing the number of duties to be performed . They are , however , generally satisfied with mangling , smoothing or ironing , the clothes , and then putting them away . Sometimes they conclude with a general cleaning , which may well be necessary after the large quantity of work that has been done :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">This is the way we clean our rooms ,</l>
     <l n="2">— Clean our rooms , clean our rooms :</l>
     <l n="3">This is the way we clean our rooms</l>
     <l n="4">On a cold frosty morning !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And like good merry washing-women , they are not exhausted with their labours , but conclude with the song , “ Here we go round the bramble-bush , ” having had sufficient exercise to warm themselves on any “ cold frosty morning , ” which was doubtlessly the result , we may observe en passant , as a matter of domestic economy , aimed at by the author . It is not so easy to give a similar explanation to the game of the mulberry-bush , conducted in the same manner :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Here we go round the mulberry-bush ,</l>
     <l n="2">— The mulberry-bush , the mulberry-bush :</l>
     <l n="3">Here we go round the mulberry-bush</l>
     <l n="4">On a sunshiny morning .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In this game , the motion-cries are usually “ This is the way we wash our clothes , ” “ This is the way we dry our clothes , ” “ This is the way we make our shoes , ” “ This is the way we mend our shoes , ” “ This is the way the gentlemen walk , ” “ This is the way the ladies walk , ” &amp; c. As in other cases , the dance may be continued by the addition of cries and motions , which may be rendered pretty and characteristic in the hands of judicious actors . This game , however , requires too much exercise to render it so appropriate to the season as the other .</p>

    <head>THE GAME OF DUMP .</head>
    <head>A boy 's amusement in Yorkshire , in vogue about half a century ago , but now , I believe , nearly obsolete . It is played in this manner . The lads crowd round , and place their fists endways the one on the other , till they form a high pile of hands . Then a boy who has one hand free , knocks the piled fists off one by one , saying to every boy , as he strikes his fist away , “ What 's there , Dump ? ” He continues this process till he comes to the last fist , when he exclaims :</head>
     <l n="1">What 's there ?</l>
     <l n="2">Cheese and bread , and a mouldy halfpenny !</l>
     <l n="3">Where 's my share ?</l>
     <l n="4">I put it on the shelf , and the cat got it .</l>
     <l n="5">Where 's the cat ?</l>

   <p>Upon the church-top cracking nuts , and you may go and eat the shells ; and them as speak first shall have nine nips , nine scratches , and nine boxes over the lug !</p>
   <p>Every one then endeavours to refrain from speaking , in spite of mutual nudges and grimaces , and he who first allows a word to escape is punished by the others in the various methods adopted by schoolboys . In some places the game is played differently . The children pile their fists in the manner described above ; then one , or sometimes all of them sing ,—</p>

    <head>The operation of counting-out is a very important mystery in many puerile games . The boys or girls stand in a row , and the operator begins with the counting-out rhyme , appropriating a word to each , till he comes to the person who receives the last word , and who is accordingly “ out . ” This operation is continued till there is only one left , who is the individual chosen for the hero of the game , whatever it may be .

   <p>IV .— ALPHABET RHYMES .</p>
   <p>Amongst the various devices to establish a royal road to infantine learning , none are more ancient or useful than the rhymes which serve to impress the letters of the alphabet upon the attention and memory of children . As early as the fifteenth century , “ Mayster Benet , ” who was rector of Sandon , in Essex , in 1440 , and afterwards a prebend of St. Paul 's , composed or translated an alphabet-rhyme , which not only professed to recall the memory of the letters , but at a time when the benefit of clergy was in vogue , held out the inducement of providing means for avoiding the punishment of death . The following copy is taken from two versions in MS. Harl . 541 , compared with each other :</p>
   <p>“ Who so wyll be wyse and worshyp to wynne , leern he on lettur and loke upon another of the A . B. C. of Arystotle .

   <p>A. APPLE-PIE .</p>
   <p>Eachard , a learned clergyman of the Church of England , published a work in 1671 ,<span corresp="#note36" type="note_anchor">[ 36 ]</span>in which he condescends to illustrate his argument by a reference to this celebrated history . Talking of the various modes of preaching adopted by different sects , he proceeds in this manner : “ And whereas it has been observed that some of our clergie are sometimes over nice in taking notice of the meer words that they find in texts , so these are so accurate as to go to the very letters . As suppose , sir , you are to give an exhortation to repentance upon that of St. Matthew , ‘ Repent ye , for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand : ’ you must observe that Repent is a rich word , wherein every letter exhorts us to our duty ,— Repent , R. readily , E. earnestly , P. presently , E. effectually , N. nationally , T. thoroughly . Again , Repent Roaringly , Eagerly , Plentifully , Heavily ( because of h ) , Notably , Terribly . And why not , Repent Rarely , Evenly , Prettily , Elegantly , Neatly , Tightly ? And also , why not , A apple-pasty , B bak 'd it , C cut it , D divided it , E eat it , F fought for it , G got it , &amp; c. I had not time , sir , to look any further into their way of preaching ; but if I had , I am sure I should have found that they have no reason to despise our church upon that account . ” The worthy divine would have censured the sermon on Malt attributed to the elder Dodd .</p>

   <p>We thus find this nursery romance descending in all its purity for nearly two centuries . It may be even older than the time of Charles II ., for it does not appear as a novelty in the quotation we have just given . Be this as it may , the oldest edition I know of was printed some half-century since by Marshall , in Aldermary Churchyard , entitled “ The Tragical Death of A. Apple-pye , who was cut in pieces and eat by twenty-five gentlemen , with whom all little people ought to be very well acquainted , ” which runs as follows :</p>

     <l n="2">C. cut it , D , dealt it ,</l>

     <l n="4">G. got it , H. had it ,<span corresp="#note37" type="note_anchor">[ 37 ]</span></l>
     <l n="5">J. join 'd for it , K. kept it ,</l>
     <l n="6">L. long 'd for it , M. mourn 'd for it ,</l>
     <l n="7">N. nodded at it , O. open 'd it ,</l>
     <l n="8">P. peep 'd in it , Q. quarter 'd it ,</l>
     <l n="9">R. ran for it , S. stole it ,</l>
     <l n="10">T. took it , V. viewed it , W. wanted it ;</l>
     <l n="11">X. Y . Z. and Ampersy-and ,</l>
     <l n="12">They all wish 'd for a piece in hand .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">At last they every one agreed</l>
     <l n="14">Upon the apple-pye to feed ;</l>
     <l n="15">But as there seem 'd to be so many ,</l>
     <l n="16">Those who were last might not have any .</l>
     <l n="17">Unless some method there was taken ,</l>
     <l n="18">That every one might save their bacon .</l>
     <l n="19">They all agreed to stand in order</l>
     <l n="20">Around the apple-pye 's fine border .</l>
     <l n="21">Take turn as they in hornbook stand ,</l>
     <l n="22">From great A down to &amp;,</l>
     <l n="23">In equal parts the pye divide ,</l>
     <l n="24">As you may see on t'other side .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <note xml:id="note37" place="bottom" n="37">Some copies say “ H. halv 'd it , I. ey 'd it , ” and afterwards , “ U. hew 'd it , ... X. crossed it , Y. yearn 'd for it , and Z. put it in his pocket , and said , Well done ! ”</note>
   <p>Then follows a woodcut of the pie , surrounded by a square of the letters , though it is not very easy to perceive how the conditions of the problem are to be fulfilled . The remainder of the book , a small 32mo ., is occupied with “ A Curious Discourse that passed between the twenty-five letters at dinner-time , ” —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Says A , give me a good large slice .</l>
     <l n="2">Says B , a little bit , but nice .</l>
     <l n="3">Says C , cut me a piece of crust .</l>
     <l n="4">Take it , says D , it 's dry as dust .</l>
     <l n="5">Says E , I 'll eat now fast , who will .</l>
     <l n="6">Says F , I vow I 'll have my fill .</l>
     <l n="7">Says G , give it me good and great .</l>
     <l n="8">Says H , a little bit I hate .</l>
     <l n="9">Says I , I love the juice the best ,</l>
     <l n="10">And K the very same confest .</l>
     <l n="11">Says L , there 's nothing more I love ,</l>
     <l n="12">Says M , it makes your teeth to move .</l>
     <l n="13">N noticed what the others said ;</l>
     <l n="14">O others ’ plates with grief survey 'd .</l>
     <l n="15">P praised the cook up to the life .</l>
     <l n="16">Q quarrel 'd ‘ cause he 'd a bad knife .</l>
     <l n="17">Says R , it runs short , I 'm afraid .</l>
     <l n="18">S silent sat , and nothing said .</l>
     <l n="19">T thought that talking might lose time ;</l>
     <l n="20">U understood it at meals a crime .</l>
     <l n="21">W wish 'd there had been a quince in ;</l>
     <l n="22">Says X , those cooks there 's no convincing .</l>
     <l n="23">Says Y , I 'll eat , let others wish .</l>
     <l n="24">Z sat as mute as any fish ,</l>
     <l n="25">While Ampersy-and he licked the dish .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The manner in which a practical moral good was to be inferred from this doggerel is not very apparent , but Mr. Marshall had a way of his own in settling the difficulty . The finale must not be omitted : “ Having concluded their discourse and dinner together , I have nothing more to add , but that , if my little readers are pleased with what they have found in this book , they have nothing to do but to run to Mr. Marshall 's at No . 4 , in Aldermary Churchyard , where they may have several books , not less entertaining than this , of the same size and price . But that you may not think I leave you too abruptly , I here present you with the picture of the old woman who made the apple-pye you have been reading about . She has several more in her basket , and she promises , if you are good children , you shall never go supperless to bed while she has one left . But as good people always ask a blessing of God before meals , therefore , as a token that you are good , and deserve a pye , you must learn the two following graces , the one to be said before the meals , the other after ; and the Lord 's Prayer every night and morning . ” Two graces and the Lord 's Prayer conclude the tract .</p>

   <p>THE DEMANDS JOYOUS .</p>
   <p>It is not generally known that many of our popular riddles are centuries old . Yet such is the fact , and those whose course of reading has made them acquainted with ancient collections are not unfrequently startled by observing a quibble of the fifteenth or sixteenth century go the round of modern newspapers as a new invention , or perhaps as an importation from America ! A few months ago , an instance of this species of resuscitation took place in the publication of the question , “ Which were made first , elbows or knees ? ” This was an enigma current in England in the time of Queen Elizabeth , and is found in a manuscript in the British Museum written before the close of the sixteenth century .</p>
   <p>The earliest collection of riddles printed in this country came from the press of Wynkyn de Worde in the year 1511 , in black letter , under the title of the “ Demaundes Joyous . ” Only one copy of this tract , which was “ imprynted at London , in Flete Strete , at the sygne of the Sonne , ” is known to exist , and it is now preserved in the public library at Cambridge . It is chiefly a compilation from an early French tract under a similar title , but which is far more remarkable for its grossness . The reader may be amused with the following specimens , and perhaps recognise some of them as old favorites :</p>
   <p>“ Demand . Who bore the best burden that ever was borne ?— R . The ass on which our Lady rode when she fled with our Lord into Egypt . D. What became of that ass ?— R . Adam 's mother did eat her . D. Who is Adam 's mother ?— R . The earth .</p>
   <p>Demand . What space is from the surface of the sea to its greatest depth ?— R . A stone 's cast .</p>
   <p>Demand . How many calves ’ tails behoveth to reach from the earth to the sky ?— R . No more but one , an ’ it be long enough .</p>
   <p>Demand . Which is the most profitable beast , and that which men eat least of ?— R . Bees .</p>
   <p>Demand . Which is the broadest water , and the least jeopardy to pass over ?— R . The dew .</p>
   <p>Demand . What thing is that which never was nor never will be ?— R . A mouse making her nest in a cat 's ear .</p>
   <p>Demand . Why doth a dog turn himself thrice round before he layeth down ?— R . Because he knoweth not the bed 's head from its foot .</p>
   <p>Demand . Why do men make an oven in the town ?— R . For because they cannot make the town in the oven .</p>
   <p>Demand . How may a man know or perceive a cow in a flock of sheep ?— R . By sight .</p>
   <p>Demand . What alms are worst bestowed that men give ?— R . Alms to a blind man , for he would willingly see him hanged by the neck that gave it him .</p>
   <p>Demand . What thing is that which hath no end ?— R . A bowl .</p>
   <p>Demand . What people be they that never go a-procession ?— R . Those that ring the bells in the mean time .</p>
   <p>Demand . What is that that freezeth never ?— R . Hot water .</p>

   <p>The reader will please to recollect the antiquity of these , and their curiosity , before he condemns their triviality . Let the worst be said of them , they are certainly as good as some of Shakespeare 's jokes , which no doubt elicited peals of laughter from an Elizabethan audience . This may be said to be only a negative kind of recommendation , and , indeed , when we reflect on the apparent poverty of verbal humour in those days , the wonder is that it could have been so well relished . The fact must be that we often do not understand the greater part of the meaning intended to be conveyed .</p>
   <p>To revert to the lengthened transmission of jokes , I may mention my discovery of the following in MS. Addit . 5008 , in the British Museum , a journal of the time of Queen Elizabeth . The anecdote , by some means , went the round of the provincial press in 1843 , as of modern composition . “ On a very rainy day , a man , entering his house , was accosted by his wife in the following manner : ‘ Now , my dear , while you are wet , go and fetch me a bucket of water . ’ He obeyed , brought the water and threw it all over her , saying at the same time , ‘ Now , my dear , while you are wet , go and fetch another ! ’ ”</p>
   <p>VI .— NATURE-SONGS .</p>
   <p>Rhymes upon natural objects and rural sayings are perhaps more generally interesting than any other relics of the popular anthology . They not unfrequently contain scientific truths , and have been considered worthy of examination by the philosopher ; while the unlearned are often contented to use them as substitutes for the barometer or Nautical Almanac . We all recollect the story of Dr. Johnson , and the boy who prophesied a shower when not a speck was to be seen in the sky . The doctor , drenched with rain , hastened back to the lad , and offered him a shilling if he would divulge the data of his prediction . “ Why , you zee , zur , when that black ram holds its tail up , it be sure to rain ! ” The story loses none of its force when we find it in the Hundred Merry Tales , printed nearly two centuries before Dr. Johnson was born .</p>

   <p>Of the “ change of tune ” alluded to in these verses , it has been remarked ( Trans . Linn . Soc . ) that in early season the cuckoo begins with the interval of a minor third , proceeds to a major third , then to a fourth , then to a fifth ; after which his voice breaks , never attaining a minor sixth . This was observed by old John Heywood , Workes , 1576 , vi . 95 :</p>

   <p>The following “ tokens of love and marriage by hearing the cuckow , or seeing other birds first in the morning , ” are extracted from an old chap-book entitled , the Golden Cabinet , or the Compleat Fortune-teller , n. d .: “ When you walk out in the spring , as soon as you hear the cuckow , sit down on a bank or other convenient place , and pull your stockings off , saying ,—</p>

Take and look at it , and of the same colour will that of your lover be ; wrap it in a piece of paper , and keep it ten days carefully ; then , if it has not changed , the person will be constant : but if it dies , you are flattered . ” Gay alludes to this method of divination in his Fourth Pastoral , ed . 1742 , p. 32 .</p>

    <head>THE ROBIN AND THE WREN .</head>
    <head>The superstitious reverence with which these birds are almost universally regarded takes its origin from a pretty belief that they undertake the delicate office of covering the dead bodies of any of the human race with moss or leaves , if by any means left exposed to the heavens . This opinion is alluded to by Shakespeare and many writers of his time , as by Drayton , for example :</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Cov'ring with moss the dead 's unclosed eye ,</l>
     <l n="2">The little red-breast teacheth charitie .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">Webster , in his tragedy of Vittoria Corombona , 1612 , couples the wren</l>
     <l n="4">with the robin as coadjutors in this friendly office :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">Call for the robin red-breast and the wren ,</l>
     <l n="6">Since o'er shady groves they hover ,</l>
     <l n="7">And with leaves and flowers do cover</l>
     <l n="8">The friendless bodies of unburied men .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Notwithstanding the beautiful passage in Shakespeare to which we have alluded , it is nevertheless undeniable that , even to this day , the ancient belief attached to these birds is perpetuated chiefly by the simple ballad of the Babes in the Wood . Early in the last century , Addison was infatuated with that primitive song . “ Admitting , ” he says , “ there is even a despicable simplicity in the verse , yet because the sentiments appear genuine and unaffected , they are able to move the mind of the most polite reader with inward meltings of humanity and compassion . ” Exactly so ; but this result arises from the extraordinary influence of early association over the mind , not from the pathos of the ballad itself , which is infinitely inferior to the following beautiful little nursery song I have the pleasure of transcribing into these pages :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">

   <p>Adages respecting the robin and the wren , generally including the martin and swallow , are common in all parts of the country . In giving the following , it should be premised it is a popular notion that the wren is the wife of the robin ; and Mr .

   <p>Nor let it be thought there is any impiety in giving these verses in the form in which they are cherished , for the humble recorders of them dream of no irreverence . On the contrary , the sanctification of these harmless birds is no unpoetical or objectionable fragment of the old popular mythology ; and when we reflect that not even a sparrow “ is forgotten before God , ” can we blame a persuasion which protects more innocent members of the feathered tribes from the intrusion of the wanton destroyer ?</p>
   <p>It is exceedingly unlucky to molest the nests of any of these birds . This belief is very prevalent , and it was acted upon in a case which came under my observation , where , misfortune having twice followed the destruction of a swallow 's nest , the birds were afterwards freely permitted to enjoy the corner of a portico , where their works were certainly not very ornamental . The following verses were obtained from Essex :</p>

   <p>The Irish call the wren the king of birds ; and they have a story that , when the birds wanted to choose a king , they determined that the one which could fly highest should have the crown . The wren , being small , very cunningly hid itself under the wing of the eagle ; and when that bird could fly no higher , the wren slipped from its hiding-place , and easily gained the victory . In Cotgrave 's Dictionarie , 1632 , we find the wren called roitelet , and in another dictionary , quoted by Mr. Wright , it is called roi des oiseaux , so it is probable a similar superstition prevailed in France . The ceremony of hunting of the wren on St. Stephen 's day has been so frequently described , that it is not necessary to do more than allude to it , and to mention that Mr. Crofton Croker possesses a proclamation lately issued by the mayor of Cork , forbidding the custom , with the intent “ to prevent cruelty to animals , ” as the document is headed . This custom was also prevalent in France . An analogous ceremony is still observed in Pembrokeshire on Twelfth-day , where it is customary to carry about a wren , termed the king , inclosed in a box with glass windows , surmounted by a wheel , from which are appended various coloured ribands . It is attended by men and boys , who visit the farm-houses , and sing a song , the following fragments of which are all that have come under my observation :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">For we are come here</l>
     <l n="2">To taste your good cheer ,</l>
     <l n="3">And the king is well dressed</l>
     <l n="4">In silks of the best .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">He is from a cottager 's stall ,</l>
     <l n="6">To a fine gilded hall .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The poor bird often dies under the ceremony , which tradition connects with the death of an ancient British king at the time of the Saxon invasion . The rhyme used in Ireland runs thus :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The wren , the wren , the king of all birds ,</l>
     <l n="2">Was caught St. Stephen 's day in the furze ;</l>
     <l n="3">Although he 's little his family 's great ,</l>
     <l n="4">Then pray , gentlefolks , give him a treat .</l>

   <p>expresses the hooting of the owl . This bird , according to old ballads and legends , was of exalted parentage . A rural ballad , cited in Waterton 's Essays on Natural History , 1838 , p. 8 , says :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Once I was a monarch 's daughter ,</l>

     <l n="8">Persecuted , poor , and old .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>An anonymous writer , in the Gentleman 's Magazine , vol . lxxiv . p. 1003 , mentions an old fairy tale respecting the owl , which , he says , is well known to the nurses of Herefordshire . A certain fairy , disguised as an old distressed woman , went to a baker 's shop , and begged some dough of his daughter , of whom she obtained a very small piece . This she farther requested leave to bake in the oven , where it swelling to the size of a large loaf , the baker 's daughter refused to let her have it . She , however , gave the pretended beggar another piece of dough , but still smaller than the first ; this swelled in the oven even more than the other , and was in like manner retained . A third and still smaller piece of dough came out of the oven the largest of all , and shared the same fate . The disguised fairy , convinced of the woman 's covetousness by these repeated experiments , no longer restrained her indignation . She resumed her proper form , and struck the culprit with her wand , who immediately flew out of the window in the shape of an owl . This story may be a version of the legend alluded to by Ophelia in Hamlet , iv . 5 : “ They say the owl was a baker 's daughter . Lord , we know what we are , but know not what we may be . ”</p>

    <head>MAGPIES .</head>
    <head>Wide-spread is the superstition that it is unlucky to see magpies under certain conditions , but these vary considerably in different localities . Thus , in some counties , two bring sorrow , in others joy ; while , in some places , we are instructed that one magpie is a signal of misfortune , which can , however , be obviated by pulling off your hat , and making a very polite bow to the knowing bird . This operation I have more than once seen quite seriously performed . In Lancashire they say :</head>
     <l n="1">One for anger ,</l>
     <l n="2">Two for mirth ,</l>
     <l n="3">Three for a wedding ,</l>
     <l n="4">Four for a birth ,</l>
     <l n="5">Five for rich ,</l>
     <l n="6">Six for poor ,</l>
     <l n="7">Seven for a witch ,</l>
     <l n="8">I can tell you no more .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But in Tim Bobbin it is expressly said that two are indicative of ill fortune : “ I saigh two rott'n pynots , hongum , that wur a sign o ’ bad fashin ; for I heard my gronny say hoode os leef o seen two owd harries os two pynots . ” The same belief obtains in Scotland . In the North they thus address the bird :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Magpie , magpie , chatter and flee ,</l>
     <l n="2">Turn up thy tail , and good luck fall me .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The half-nest of the magpie is accounted for by a rural ornithological legend . Once on a time , when the world was very young , the magpie , by some accident or another , although she was quite as cunning as she is at present , was the only bird that was unable to build a nest . In this perplexity , she applied to the other members of the feathered race , who kindly undertook to instruct her . So , on a day appointed , they assembled for that purpose , and , the materials having been collected , the blackbird said , “ Place that stick there , ” suiting the action to the word , as she commenced the work . “ Ah ! ” said the magpie , “ I knew that afore . ” The other birds followed with their suggestions , but to every piece of advice , the magpie kept saying , “ Ah ! I knew that afore . ” At length , when the birdal habitation was half-finished , the patience of the company was fairly exhausted by the pertinacious conceit of the pye , so they all left her with the united exclamation , “ Well , Mistress Mag , as you seem to know all about it , you may e'en finish the nest yourself . ” Their resolution was obdurate and final , and to this day the magpie exhibits the effects of partial instruction by her miserably incomplete abode .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The magpie is always called Madge , and the Christian names given to</l>
     <l n="2">birds deserve a notice . Thus we have Jack Snipe , Jenny Wren , Jack Daw ,</l>
     <l n="3">Tom Tit , Robin Redbreast , Poll Parrot , Jill Hooter , Jack Curlew , Jack</l>
     <l n="4">Nicker , and King Harry for the goldfinch , and the list might be widely</l>
     <l n="5">extended . A starling is always Jacob , a sparrow is Philip , a raven is</l>
     <l n="6">Ralph , and the consort of the Tom Tit rejoices in the euphonic name of</l>
     <l n="7">Betty ! Children give the name of Dick to all small birds , which , in</l>
     <l n="8">nursery parlance , are universally Dickybirds .</l>

   <p>THE WOOD-PIGEON .</p>
   <p>An Isle of Wight legend respecting this bird tells us that , soon after the creation of the world , all the birds were assembled for the purpose of learning to build their nests , and the magpie , being very sagacious and cunning , was chosen to teach them . Those birds that were most industrious , such as the wren and the long-tailed-capon , or pie-finch , he instructed to make whole nests in the shape of a cocoa-nut , with a small hole on one side ; others , not so diligent , he taught to make half-nests , shaped something like a teacup . Having thus instructed a great variety of birds according to their capacity , it came to the turn of the wood-pigeon , who , being a careless and lazy bird , was very indifferent about the matter , and while the magpie was directing him how to place the little twigs , &amp; c ., he kept exclaiming , “ What , athurt and across ! what zoo ! what zoo !— athurt and across ! what zoo ! what zoo ! ” At length the magpie was so irritated with his stupidity and indolence , that he flew away , and the wood-pigeon , having had no more instruction , to this day builds the worst nest of any of the feathered tribe , consisting merely of layers of cross-twigs .</p>
   <p>Montagu gives a Suffolk version of the tale , which differs considerably from the above . “ The magpie , it is said , once undertook to teach the pigeon how to build a more substantial and commodious dwelling ; but , instead of being a docile pupil , the pigeon kept on her old cry of ‘ Take two , Taffy ! take two ! ’ The magpie insisted that this was a very unworkmanlike manner of proceeding , one stick at a time being as much as could be managed to advantage ; but the pigeon reiterated her ‘ two , take two , ’ till Mag , in a violent passion , gave up the task , exclaiming , ‘ I say that one at a time 's enough ; and , if you think otherwise , you may set about the work yourself , for I will have no more to do with it ! ’ Since that time , the wood-pigeon has built her slight platform of sticks , which certainly suffers much in comparison with the strong substantial structure of the magpie . ” The cooing of the wood-pigeon produces , it is said —</p>
   <p>Take two-o coo , Taffy ! Take two-o coo , Taffy !</p>
   <p>Alluding , says Mr . Chambers , to a story of a Welshman , who thus interpreted the note , and acted upon the recommendation by stealing two of his neighbour 's cows .</p>

    <head>DRAGON-FLIES .</head>
    <head>In some parts of the Isle of Wight , these insects are found of a peculiarly large size , and their colours are extremely beautiful . There is an old legend respecting them which is still current . It is supposed by the country people that their sting or bite is venomous , as bad as that of a snake or adder , and perhaps from this belief their provincial name of snake-stanger or snake-stang is derived . It is said that these insects can distinguish the good children from the bad when they go fishing : if the latter go too near the water , they are almost sure to be bitten ; but when the good boys go , the dragon-flies point out the places where the fish are , by settling on the banks , or flags , in the proper direction . This curious myth is commemorated by the following song :</head>
     <l n="1">Snakestanger ! snakestanger ! vlee aal about the brooks ;</l>
     <l n="2">Sting aal the bad bwoys that vor the vish looks ,</l>

     <l n="2">Sting all the bad boys who for the fish look ;</l>
     <l n="3">But let the good boys catch all that they can ,</l>
     <l n="4">And then take them home to be fried in a pan ;</l>

   <lg>
     <l n="1">Snail , snail , come out of your hole ,</l>
     <l n="2">Or else I 'll beat you as black as a coal .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Mr . Chambers , p. 171 , gives some very interesting observations on these lines . “ In England , ” he says , “ the snail scoops out hollows , little rotund chambers , in limestone , for its residence . This habit of the animal is so important in its effects , as to have attracted the attention of geologists ; one of the most distinguished of whom ( Dr. Buckland ) alluded to it at the meeting of the British Association at Plymouth , in 1841 . ” The above rhyme is a boy 's invocation to the snail to come out of such holes or any other places of retreat resorted to by it . Mr . Chambers also informs us that , in some districts of Scotland , it is supposed that it is an indication of good weather if the snail obeys the injunction of putting out its horn :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Snailie , snailie , shoot out your horn ,</l>
     <l n="2">And tell us if it will be a bonnie day the morn .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It appears from Gay 's Shepherd 's Week , ed . 1742 , p. 34 , that snails were formerly used in rural love-divinations . It was the custom<span corresp="#note44" type="note_anchor">[ 44 ]</span>to place the little animal on the soft ashes , and to form an opinion respecting the initial of the name of a future lover by the fancied letter made by the crawling of the snail on the ashes :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Last May-day fair I search 'd to find a snail ,</l>
     <l n="2">That might my secret lover 's name reveal ;</l>
     <l n="3">Upon a gooseberry bush a snail I found ,</l>
     <l n="4">For always snails near sweetest fruit abound .</l>
     <l n="5">I seiz 'd the vermin , home I quickly sped ,</l>
     <l n="6">And on the hearth the milk-white embers spread .</l>
     <l n="7">Slow crawl 'd the snail , and if I right can spell ,</l>
     <l n="8">In the soft ashes mark 'd a curious L ;</l>
     <l n="9">Oh , may this wondrous omen lucky prove ,</l>
     <l n="10">For L is found in Lubberkin and Love !</l>

   <p>Tobacco was formerly held in great esteem as a medicine . Sickness was the old term for illness of any kind , and is no doubt the more correct expression .</p>
   <p>It may just be worth a passing notice to observe , that Shakespeare never mentions tobacco , nor alludes to it even indirectly . What a brilliant subject for a critic ! A treatise might be written to prove from this circumstance that the great poet was not in the habit of smoking ; or , on the contrary , that he was so great an admirer of the pernicious weed , that , being unable to allude to it without a panegyric , he very wisely eschewed the subject for fear of giving offence to his royal master , the author of the ‘ Counterblast . ’ The discussion , at all events , would be productive of as much utility as the disputes which have occasioned so many learned letters respecting the orthography of the poet 's name .</p>

   <p>Metrical proverbs are so numerous , that a large volume might be filled with them without much difficulty ; and it is , therefore , unnecessary to say that nothing beyond a very small selection is here attempted . We may refer the curious reader to the collections of Howell , Ray , and Denham , the last of which chiefly relates to natural objects and the weather , for other examples ; but the subject is so diffuse , that these writers have gone a very short way towards the compilation of a complete series .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Give a thing and take again ,</l>
     <l n="2">And you shall ride in hell 's wain !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Said by children when one wishes a gift to be returned , a system naturally much disliked . So says Plato , {~ GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER NU ~} {~ GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA ~} {~ GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER NU ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER NU ~} {~ GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA ~} {~ GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA ~} {~ GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU ~}{~ GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA ~}. Ray , p. 113 , ed . 1768 . Ben Jonson appears to allude to this proverb in the Sad Shepherd , where Maudlin says — “ Do you give a thing and take a thing , madam ? ” Cotgrave , Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues , 1632 , in v. Retirer , mentions “ a triviall proverb : ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Give a thing ,</l>
     <l n="2">And take a thing ,</l>
     <l n="3">To weare the divell 's gold-ring .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And it is alluded to in a little work entitled Homer a la Mode , a mock poem upon the First and Second Books of Homer 's Iliads , 12mo . Oxford , 1665 , p. 34 :</p>

   <p>THE CAULD LAD OF HILTON .</p>
   <p>This fairy or goblin was seldom seen , but his gambols were heard nightly in the hall of the great house . He overturned everything in the kitchen after the servants had gone to bed , and was , in short , one of the most mischievous sprites you could imagine . One night , however , the kitchen happened to be left in great confusion , and the goblin , who did everything by contraries , set it completely to rights ; and the next morning it was in perfect apple-pie order . We may be quite sure that , after this occurrence , the kitchen was not again made orderly by the servants .</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding , however , the service thus nightly rendered by the Cauld Lad , the servants did not like it . They preferred to do their own work without preternatural agency , and accordingly resolved to do their best to drive him from their haunts . The goblin soon understood what was going on , and he was heard in the dead of night to warble the following lines in a melancholy strain :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Wae 's me ! wae 's me !</l>
     <l n="2">The acorn is not yet</l>
     <l n="3">Fallen from the tree ,</l>
     <l n="4">That 's to grow the wood ,</l>
     <l n="5">That 's to make the cradle ,</l>
     <l n="6">That 's to rock the bairn ,</l>
     <l n="7">That 's to grow to a man ,</l>
     <l n="8">That 's to lay me .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>He was , however , deceived in this prediction ; for one night , being colder than usual , he complained in moving verse of his condition . Accordingly , on the following evening , a cloak and hood were placed for him near the fire . The servants had unconsciously accomplished their deliverance , for present gifts to fairies , and they for ever disappear . On the next morning the following lines were found inscribed on the wall :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">I 've taken your cloak , I 've taken your hood ;</l>
     <l n="2">The Cauld Lad of Hilton will do no more good !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>A great variety of stories in which fairies are frightened away by presents , are still to be heard in the rural districts of England . Another narrative , by Mr. Longstaffe , relates that on one occasion a woman found her washing and ironing regularly performed for her every night by the fairies . In gratitude to the “ good people , ” she placed green mantles for their acceptance , and the next night the fairies departed , exclaiming —</p>
   <p>Now the pixies ’ work is done ! We take our clothes , and off we run .</p>
   <p>Mrs. Bray tells a similar story of a Devonshire pixy , who helped an old woman to spin . One evening she spied the fairy jumping out of her door , and observed that it was very raggedly dressed ; so the next day she thought to win the services of the elf further by placing some smart new clothes , as big as those made for a doll , by the side of her wheel . The pixy came , put on the clothes , and clapping its hands with delight , vanished , saying these lines :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Pixy fine , pixy gay ,</l>
     <l n="2">Pixy now will run away .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Fairies always talk in rhyme . Mr . Allies mentions a Worcestershire fairy legend which says that , upon one occasion , a pixy came to a ploughman in a field , and exclaimed :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Oh , lend a hammer and a nail ,</l>
     <l n="2">Which we want to mend our pail .</l>

   <p>This rhyme is traditionally known in the North of England , and refers , it is said , to Sir Ralph Ashton , who , in the latter part of the fifteenth century , exercised great severity as vice-constable . The ancient custom of riding the black lad at Ashton-under-Lyne on Easter Monday , which consists of carrying an effigy on horseback through the town , shooting at it , and finally burning it , is alleged to have taken its origin from this individual , who , according to tradition , was shot as he was riding down the principal street . According to another story , the custom commemorates the valiant actions of Thomas Ashton at the battle of Neville 's Cross .</p>

   <p>The general was transformed into a large stone which stands on a spot from which Long Compton is not visible , but on ascending a slight rise close to it , the town is revealed to view . Roger Gale , writing in 1719 , says that whoever dared to contradict this story was regarded “ as a most audacious freethinker . ” It is said that no man could ever count these stones , and that a baker once attempted it by placing a penny loaf on each of them , but somehow or other he failed in counting his own bread .

   <p>SHERSTON MAGNA .</p>
   <p>The following very curious observations on this town are extracted from an anonymous MS. in my possession , written forty or fifty years ago . I have never seen the lines in print . Aubrey , in his Natural History of Wiltshire , mentions the plant called Danes-blood , and derives the name from a similar circumstance . Some observations on Sherston may be seen in Camden , ed . Gough , i . 96 . It is Sceor-stan , where the celebrated battle between the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes was fought in the year 1016 , and prodigies of valour exhibited by the combatants .</p>
   <p>“ When a schoolboy , I have often traced the intrenchments at Sherston Magna , which are still visible on the north side of the town , and particularly in a field near the brow of a hill which overlooks a branch of the river Avon , which rises a little below Didmarton ; and with other boys have gone in quest of a certain plant in the field where the battle was said to have been fought , which the inhabitants pretended dropt blood when gathered , and called Danesblood , corruptly no doubt for Danewort , which was supposed to have sprung from the blood of the Danes slain in that battle . Among other memorials , the statue of a brave warrior , vulgarly called Rattlebone , but whose real name I could never learn , is still standing upon a pedestal on the east side of the church-porch , as I 've been lately informed , where I saw it above fifty years ago : of whose bravery , almost equal to that of Withrington , many fabulous stories are told . One , in particular , like some of the Grecian fables of old , built upon the resemblance his shield bears to the shape of a tile-stone , which he is said to have placed over his stomach after it had been ripped up in battle , and by that means maintained the field ; whilst the following rude verses are said to have been repeated by the king by way of encouragement :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Fight on , Rattlebone ,</l>
     <l n="2">And thou shalt have Sherstone ;</l>

   <p>This saying , as given by Surtees , is still remembered near Bellasis , and is preferable to Hutchinson 's version of it from the east window of the north transept of St. Andrew 's Auckland church , where he says , “ are remains of an inscription painted on the glass ; the date appears 1386 ; beneath the inscription are the arms of Bellasys , and in a belt round them the following words :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">

     <l n="5">When thou gave Bellassis for Henknowle ,</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>connects it with a grant dated 1380 , from John de Belasye to the convent of Durham , of his lands in Wolveston , in exchange for the Manor of Henknoll . But Bellasyse is not even within the Manor of Wolveston , and , in fact , the Manor of Bellasye was held by the Prior in 1361 ; and we can only account for the proverb by supposing that , at a former period , Bellasyse had been exchanged for lands , but not the manor of Henknoll . The legend dates the matter in crusading times , and is chivalric in the extreme . John of Bellasis , minded to take up the cross , and fight in Holy Land , found his piety sorely let and hindered by his attachment to the green pastures and deep meadows of his ancestors . With resolution strong , he exchanged them with the Church of Durham , for Henknoll , near Auckland . He went to fight , but lived it seems to return and repent his rash bargain . I descend by one step , from the sublime to the ridiculous , to mention how oddly more recent characters are wound round those of olden time , for a popular notion is that the Red-Cross Knight had enormous teeth , and was passionately addicted to “ race-horses ! ” Children , moreover , have a dark saying when they leap off anything :</p>

   <p>Miss Bellasyse , the heiress of Brancepeth , died for love of Robert Shafto , of Whitworth , whose portrait at Whitworth represents him as very young and handsome , with yellow hair . He was the favorite candidate in the election of 1791 , when he was popularly called Bonny Bobby Shafto ; and the old song of the older Bobby , who , it seems , was also “ bright and fair , combing down his yellow hair , ” was revived with the addition of —</p>

Nor is it less renowned for its exceeding high mountains ; for , beside the mountain called Wrye-nose , on the top of which , near the highway side , are to be seen three shire-stones within a foot of each other , one in this county , another in Westmoreland , and a third in Lancashire . There are three other hills , Skiddaw , Lanvalin , and Casticand , very remarkable . Skiddaw riseth up with two mighty high heads , like Parnassus , and beholds Scruffel Hill , which is in Annandale , in Scotland ; and accordingly as mists arise or fall upon these heads , the people thereby prognosticate of the change of weather , singing this rhime :</head>

    <head>INGLEBOROUGH .</head>
    <head>“ Here are three great hills , not far distant asunder , seeming to be as high as the clouds , which are Ingleborow , Penigent , and Pendle , on the top of which grows a peculiar plant called cloudsberry , as though it came out of the clouds . This hill formerly did the country much harm , by reason of an extraordinary deal of water gushing out of it , and is now famous for an infallible sign of rain whensoever the top of it is covered with a mist ; and by reason of the excessive height for which they are all three celebrated , there is this proverbial rhime goes current amongst them :</head>

   <p>After the abdication of James the Second , in the year 1688 , a rumour was spread in the North of England that he was lying off the Yorkshire coast , ready to make a descent with a numerous army from France , in hopes of regaining his lost throne . This report gave the Lord Lieutenant of Westmoreland an opportunity of showing his own and the people 's attachment to the new order of things ; he accordingly called out the posse comitatus , comprising all able-bodied men from sixteen to sixty . The order was obeyed with alacrity ; and the inhabitants met armed in a field called Miller'shYpppHeNclose , near Kendal , from whence they marched to Kirby Lonsdale . This historical fact explains the above popular rhyme , the meaning of which is , at this day , perhaps not generally understood .— West . and Cumb . Dial . 89 .</p>

   <p>IX .— SUPERSTITION-RHYMES .</p>
   <p>Although the spread of education has doubtlessly weakened in an extraordinary degree the hold which superstition formerly maintained on the mind of the public , yet vestiges of the more innocent portions of superstitious belief are still in considerable repute amongst the lower orders , and may be found in all their force in many of the rural districts . It may be a question how far a complete eradication of these would benefit the cause of religion and morality , treason though it be in these times to doubt the efficacy of argumentative education . But all of us cannot be philosophers ; and need we reprove a pretty village maiden for plucking the even-ash or four-leaved clover ? The selfish tendencies of the age , in their opposition to every action which partakes of poetry or romantic belief , will effect their mission without the aid of the cynic .</p>
   <p>CHARM-RHYMES .</p>
   <p>The subject of rural charms , many of which are lineal descendants from those used by our Anglo-Saxon ancestors , is one of great interest and curiosity ; and it were much to be wished that a complete collection of them were formed . The following one is taken from a manuscript of the time of Queen Elizabeth ; the others are for the most part still in use .</p>
   <p>This charme shall be said at night , or against night , about the place or feild , or about beasts without feild , and whosoever cometh in , he goeth not out for certaine .</p>

   <p>Warts .— Whoever will charm away a wart must take a pin and go to an ash-tree . He then crosses the wart with the pin three times , and , after each crossing , repeats :</p>

     <l n="1">Ash-tree , ashen-tree ,</l>
     <l n="2">Pray buy this wart of me !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>After which he sticks the pin in the tree , and the wart soon disappears , and grows on the tree instead . This must be done secretly . I need scarcely observe that the ash is sacred amongst all the Teutonic and Scandinavian nations .</p>
   <p>Another .— Take a bean-shell , and rub the wart with it ; then bring the bean-shell under an ash-tree , and repeat :</p>

   <p>Cattle .— Reginald Scot relates that an old woman who cured the diseases of cattle , and who always required a penny and a loaf for her services , used these lines for the purpose :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">My loaf in my lap ,</l>
     <l n="2">My penny in my purse ;</l>
     <l n="3">Thou art never the better ,</l>

   <p>The same writer gives a curious anecdote of a priest who , on one occasion , went out a-nights with his companions , and stole all the eels from a miller 's weir . The poor miller made his complaint to the same priest , who desired him to be quiet , for he would so denounce the thief and his confederates by bell , book , and candle , they should have small joy of their fish . Accordingly , on the following Sunday , during the service , he pronounced the following sentences to the congregation :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">All you that have stol'n the miller 's eels ,</l>
     <l n="2">Laudate Dominum de caelis ;</l>

     <l n="4">Benedicamus Domino .</l>

   <p>“ An old woman came into an house at a time whenas the maid was churning of butter , and having laboured long , and could not make her butter come , the old woman told the maid what was wont to be done when she was a maid , and also in her mother 's young time , that if it happened their butter would not come readily , they used a charm to be said over it whilst yet it was in beating , and it would come straightways , and that was this :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Come , butter , come ,</l>
     <l n="2">Come , butter , come ;</l>
     <l n="3">Peter stands at the gate ,</l>
     <l n="4">Waiting for a buttered cake ;</l>
     <l n="5">Come , butter , come !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This , said the old woman , being said three times , will make your butter come , for it was taught my mother by a learned churchman in Queen Marie 's days ; whenas churchmen had more cunning , and could teach people many a trick that our ministers now-a-days know not . ” — Ady 's Candle in the Dark , 1656 , p. 59 .</p>
   <p>“ There be twenty several ways , ” says Scot , 1584 , “ to make your butter come , which for brevity I omit , as to bind your churn with a rope , to thrust therein a red-hot spit , &amp; c .; but your best remedy and surest way is to look well to your dairy-maid or wife , that she neither eat up the cream , nor sell away your butter . ”</p>

    <head>THE OX .</head>
    <head>In Herefordshire , on the eve of Twelfth-day , the best ox , white or spotted , has a cake placed on his left horn ; the men and girls of the farm-house being present , drink out of a silver tankard to him , repeating this verse —</head>
     <l n="1">We drink to thee and thy white horn ,</l>
     <l n="2">Pray God send master a good crop of corn ,</l>
     <l n="3">Wheat , rye , and barley , and all sorts of grain :</l>
     <l n="4">If alive at the next time , I 'll hail thee again !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The animal is then sprinkled with the libation . This makes him toss his head up and down , and if , in so doing , the cake be thrown forwards , it is a good omen ; if backwards , the contrary . Sir S. Meyrick , Trans . Brit . Arch . Assoc . Glouc . 1848 , p. 128 , appears to consider this custom a relic of the ancient Pagan religion .</p>

    <head>LOVE DIVINATIONS .</head>
    <head>Butter-dock .— The seeds of butterdock must be sowed by a young unmarried woman half an hour before sunrise on a Friday morning , in a lonesome place . She must strew the seeds gradually on the grass , saying these words —</head>
     <l n="1">I sow , I sow !</l>
     <l n="2">Then , my own dear ,</l>
     <l n="3">Come here , come here ,</l>
     <l n="4">And mow and mow !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The seed being scattered , she will see her future husband mowing with a scythe at a short distance from her . She must not be frightened , for , if she says “ Have mercy on me , ” he will immediately vanish . This method is said to be infallible , but it is looked upon as a bold , desperate , and presumptuous undertaking .</p>
   <p>True-love .— Two young unmarried girls must sit together in a room by themselves , from twelve o'clock at night till one o'clock the next morning , without speaking a word . During this time each of them must take as many hairs from her head as she is years old , and , having put them into a linen cloth with some of the herb true-love , as soon as the clock strikes one , she must burn every hair separately , saying —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">I offer this my sacrifice</l>
     <l n="2">To him most precious in my eyes ;</l>
     <l n="3">I charge thee now come forth to me ,</l>
     <l n="4">That I this minute may thee see .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Upon which her first husband will appear , and walk round the room , and then vanish . The same event happens to both the girls , but neither see the other 's lover .</p>
   <p>Gerard says of the herb true-love or moonwort , p. 328 , that “ witches do wonders withall , who say that it will loose locks , and make them to fall from the feete of horses that grase where it doth growe . ”</p>
   <p>A charm-divination on the 6th of October , St . Faith 's day , is still in use in the North of England . A cake of flour , spring water , salt and sugar , is made by three girls , each having an equal hand in the composition . It is then baked in a Dutch oven , silence being strictly preserved , and turned thrice by each person . When it is well baked , it must be divided into three equal parts , and each girl must cut her share into nine pieces , drawing every piece through a wedding-ring which had been borrowed from a woman who has been married seven years . Each girl must eat her pieces of cake while she is undressing , and repeat the following verses :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">O good St . Faith , be kind to-night ,</l>
     <l n="2">And bring to me my heart 's delight ;</l>
     <l n="3">Let me my future husband view ,</l>
     <l n="4">And be my visions chaste and true .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>All three must then get into one bed , with the ring suspended by a string to the head of the couch . They will then dream of their future husbands , or if perchance one of them is destined to lead apes , she will dream of wandering by herself over crags and mountains .</p>
   <p>On the 28th of the same month , another divination is practised by the paring of an apple , which is taken by a girl in the right hand , who recites the following lines , standing in the middle of a room —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">St. Simon and Jude , on you I intrude ,</l>
     <l n="2">By this paring I hold to discover ,</l>
     <l n="3">Without any delay , to tell me this day</l>
     <l n="4">The first letter of my own true lover .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>She must then turn round three times , casting the paring over her left shoulder , and it will form the first letter of her husband 's name ; but if the paring breaks into many pieces so that no letter is discernible , she will never marry . The pips of the apple must then be placed in cold spring water , and eaten by the girl ; but for what further object my deponent sayeth not .</p>
   <p>A very singular divination practised at the period of the harvest-moon is thus described in an old chap-book . When you go to bed , place under your pillow a prayer-book open at the part of the matrimonial service , “ With this ring I thee wed ; ” place on it a key , a ring , a flower , and a sprig of willow , a small heart-cake , a crust of bread , and the following cards :— the ten of clubs , nine of hearts , ace of spades , and the ace of diamonds . Wrap all these in a thin handkerchief of gauze or muslin , and on getting into bed , cross your hands , and say —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Luna , every woman 's friend ,</l>
     <l n="2">To me thy goodness condescend ;</l>
     <l n="3">Let me this night in visions see</l>
     <l n="4">Emblems of my destiny .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>If you dream of storms , trouble will betide you ; if the storm ends in a fine calm , so will your fate ; if of a ring or the ace of diamonds , marriage ; bread , an industrious life ; cake , a prosperous life ; flowers , joy ; willow , treachery in love ; spades , death ; diamonds , money ; clubs , a foreign land ; hearts , illegitimate children ; keys , that you will rise to great trust and power , and never know want ; birds , that you will have many children ; and geese , that you will marry more than once .</p>
   <p>In Dorsetshire , the girls have a method of divination with their shoes for obtaining dreams of their future husbands . At night , on going to bed , a girl places her shoes at right angles to one another , in the form of a T , saying —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Hoping this night my true love to see ,</l>
     <l n="2">I place my shoes in the form of a T .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>On St. Luke 's day , says Mother Bunch , take marigold flowers , a sprig of marjoram , thyme , and a little wormwood ; dry them before a fire , rub them to powder ; then sift it through a fine piece of lawn , and simmer it over a slow fire , adding a small quantity of virgin honey , and vinegar . Anoint yourself with this when you go to bed , saying the following lines three times , and you will dream of your partner “ that is to be : ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">St. Luke , St. Luke , be kind to me ,</l>
     <l n="2">In dreams let me my true love see .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>If a girl desires to obtain this information , let her seek for a green peascod in which there are full nine peas , and write on a piece of paper —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Come in , my dear ,</l>
     <l n="2">And do not fear ;</l>
   </lg>
   <p>which paper she must inclose in the peascod , and lay it under the door . The first person who comes into the room will be her husband . Does Shakespeare allude to some notion of this kind by the wooing of a peascod in As You Like It , ii . 4 ?</p>

    <head>ST. AGNES ’ NIGHT .</head>
    <head>“ The women have several magical secrets handed down to them by tradition , as on St. Agnes ’ night , 21st January . Take a row of pins , and pull out every one , one after another , saying a Pater Noster , sticking a pin in your sleeve , and you will dream of him or her you shall marry . You must lie in another county , and knit the left garter about the right-legg 'd stockin ( let the other garter and stockin alone ) , and as you rehearse these following verses , at every comma knit a knot :</head>
     <l n="1">This knot I knit</l>
     <l n="2">To know the thing I know not yet :</l>
     <l n="3">That I may see</l>
     <l n="4">The man that shall my husband be ,</l>
     <l n="5">How he goes and what he wears ,</l>
     <l n="6">And what he does all the days .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Accordingly in your dream you will see him , if a musician with a lute or other instrument , if a scholar , with a book , &amp; c. A gentlewoman that I knew confessed in my hearing , that she used this method , and dreamt of her husband whom she had never seen . About two or three years after , as she was on Sunday at church , up pops a young Oxonian in the pulpit . She cries out presently to her sister , ‘ This is the very face of the man that I saw in my dream . ’ ” — Aubrey 's Miscellanies , ed . 1696 , p. 105 .</p>
   <p>On St. Agnes ’ day , take a sprig of rosemary , and another of thyme , and sprinkle them thrice with water . In the evening put one in each shoe , placing a shoe on each side of the bed , and when you retire to rest , say the following lines , and your future husband will appear “ visible to sight : ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">St. Agnes , that 's to lovers kind ,</l>
     <l n="2">Come ease the trouble of my mind .</l>

    <head>KALE .</head>
    <head>The young women of some districts in the North of England have a method of divination by kale or broth , which is used for the purpose of learning who are to be their future husbands . The plan followed is this . The maiden at bedtime stands on something on which she never stood before , holding a pot of cold kale in her hand , and repeating the following lines . She then drinks nine times , goes to bed backwards , and of course dreams of her partner :</head>
     <l n="1">Hot kale or cold kale , I drink thee ;</l>
     <l n="2">If ever I marry a man , or a man marry me ,</l>
     <l n="3">I wish this night I may him see ,</l>
     <l n="4">To-morrow may him ken</l>
     <l n="5">In church , fair , or market ,</l>
     <l n="6">Above all other men .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>On Valentine 's day take two bay leaves , sprinkle them with rose-water , and lay them across your pillow in the evening . When you go to bed , put on a clean nightgown turned wrong side outwards , and , lying down , say these words softly to yourself :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Good Valentine , be kind to me ,</l>

     <l n="3">After this go to sleep as soon as you can , and you will see in a dream</l>

    <head>BALL-DIVINATION .</head>
     <l n="1">Cook a ball , cherry-tree ;</l>
     <l n="2">Good ball , tell me</l>
     <l n="3">How many years I shall be</l>
     <l n="4">Before my true love I do see ?</l>
     <l n="5">One and two , and that makes three ;</l>
     <l n="6">Thank'ee , good ball for telling of me .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Cook is to toss , or throw , a provincialism common in the Midland counties . The ball is thrown against a wall , and the divination is taken from the number of rebounds it makes . Another version is —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Cuckoo , cherry-tree ,<span corresp="#note47" type="note_anchor">[ 47 ]</span></l>
     <l n="2">Good ball , tell me</l>
     <l n="3">How many years I shall be</l>
     <l n="4">Before I get married ?</l>
   </lg>
   <note xml:id="note47" place="bottom" n="47">The following lines reached me without an explanation . They seem to be analogous to the above :</note>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Cuckoo , cherry-tree ,</l>
     <l n="2">Lay an egg , give it me ;</l>
     <l n="3">Lay another ,</l>
     <l n="4">Give it my brother ! ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And this is probably correct , for we appear to have formed this method of divination in some indirect manner from a custom still prevalent in Germany of addressing the cuckoo , when he is first heard , with a view of ascertaining the duration of life , by counting the number of times it repeats its note . The lines used on this occasion are given by Grimm :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Kukuk , Beckerknecht !</l>
     <l n="2">Sag mir recht ,</l>
     <l n="3">Wie viel jahr Ich leben soll ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>An old story is told of a man who was on his road towards a monastery , which he was desirous of entering as a monk for the salvation of his soul , and hearing the cuckoo , stopped to count the number of notes . They were twenty-two . “ Oh ! ” said he , “ since I shall be sure to live twenty-two years , what is the use of mortifying myself in a monastery all that time ? I 'll e'en go and live merrily for twenty years , and it will be all in good time to betake me to a monastery for the other two . ” See Wright 's Essays , i . 257 ; and Latin Stories , p. 42 , de cuculo ; p. 74 , de muliere in extremis quae dixit kuckuc . Both these tales curiously illustrate the extent to which faith in the divination extended .</p>
   <p>If a maid desires to attach the affections of her lover unalterably to her , she must wait till she finds him asleep with his clothes on . She must then take away one of his garters without his perceiving it , and tie it to her own in a true-love knot , saying —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Three times this knot</l>
     <l n="2">I tie secure ;</l>
     <l n="3">Firm is the knot ,</l>
     <l n="4">Firm his love endure .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In many parts of the country , it is considered extremely unlucky to give a person anything that is sharp , as a knife , razor , &amp; c ., but the bad fortune may be averted if the receiver gives something , however trifling , in return , and exclaims —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">If you love me as I love you ,</l>
     <l n="2">No knife shall cut our love in two !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In counting the buttons of the waistcoat upwards , the last found corresponding to one of the following names indicates the destiny of the wearer :</p>

    <head>THE EVEN-ASH .</head>

     <l n="3">This even-ash I hold in my hand ,</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>She carries it in her hand a short distance , and if she meets a young man , he will be her future husband . If not , she must put the leaf in her glove , and say —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">This even-ash I hold in my glove ,</l>
     <l n="2">The first I meet is my true love .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>She carries it in her glove a short time , with the same intention as before , but if she meets no one , she places the leaf in her bosom , saying —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">This even-ash I hold in my bosom ,</l>
     <l n="2">The first I meet is my husband .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And the first young man she meets after this will infallibly be her future partner . There are a great variety of rhymes relating to the even-ash . Another is —</p>

   <p>If a person is stung with a nettle , a certain cure will be effected by rubbing dock leaves over the part , repeating the above charm very slowly . Mr. Akerman gives us another version of it as current in Wiltshire :</p>

     <l n="1">Out ‘ ettle , in dock ,</l>

    <head>THE YARROW .</head>
    <head>This plant , in the eastern counties , is termed yarroway , and there is a curious mode of divination with its serrated leaf , with which you must tickle the inside of your nose , repeating the following lines . If the operation causes the nose to bleed , it is a certain omen of success :</head>
     <l n="1">Yarroway , yarroway , bear a white blow ,</l>
     <l n="2">If my love love me , my nose will bleed now .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Another mode of divination with this plant caused a dream of a future husband . An ounce of yarrow , sewed up in flannel , must be placed under your pillow when you go to bed , and having repeated the following words , the required dream will be realized :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">

   <p>This is taken from Mr. Barnes 's Dorset Gl ., p. 320 , but the author does not inform us in what way the divination was effected . I remember throwing apple-pips into the fire , saying —</p>

   <p>Girls used to have a method of divination with a “ St. Thomas 's onion ,"[ 48 ] for the purpose of ascertaining their future partners . They peeled the onion , wrapped it up in a clean handkerchief , and then placing it under their heads , said the following lines :</p>
   <note xml:id="note48" place="bottom" n="48">One of the old cries of London was , “ Buy my rope of onions — white St. Thomas 's onions . ” They are also mentioned in the “ Hog hath lost his Pearl , ” i . 1 .</note>

     <l n="5">which were considered infallible for procuring a dream of the beloved</l>
     <l n="6">one .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>To know if your present sweetheart will marry you , let an unmarried woman take the bladebone of a shoulder of lamb , and borrowing a penknife , without on any account mentioning the purpose for which it is required , stick it through the bone when she goes to bed for nine nights in different places , repeating the following lines each time :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Tis not this bone I mean to stick ,</l>
     <l n="2">But my love 's heart I mean to prick ,</l>
     <l n="3">Wishing him neither rest nor sleep ,</l>
     <l n="4">Until he comes to me to speak .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Accordingly at the end of the nine days , or shortly afterwards , he will ask for something to put to a wound he will have met with during the time he was thus charmed . Another method is also employed for the same object . On a Friday morning , fasting , write on four pieces of paper the names of three persons you like best , and also the name of Death , fold them up , wear them in your bosom all day , and at night shake them up in your left shoe , going to bed backwards ; take out one with your left hand , and the other with your right , throw three of them out of the shoe , and in the morning whichever name remains in the shoe is that of your future husband . If Death is left , you will not marry any of them .</p>

    <head>VERVAIN .</head>
    <head>The herb vervain was formerly held of great efficacy against witchcraft , and in various diseases . Sir W. Scott mentions a popular rhyme , supposed to be addressed to a young woman by the devil , who attempted to seduce her in the shape of a handsome young man :</head>
     <l n="1">Gin you wish to be leman mine ,</l>
     <l n="2">Leave off the St. John 's wort and the vervine .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>By his repugnance to these sacred plants , his mistress discovered the cloven foot . Many ceremonies were used in gathering it . “ You must observe , ” says Gerard , “ Mother Bumbies rules to take just so many knots or sprigs , and no more , least it fall out so that it do you no good , if you catch no harme by it ; many odde olde wives ’ fables are written of vervaine , tending to witchcraft and sorcerie , which you may reade elsewhere , for I am not willing to trouble your eares with reporting such trifles as honest eares abhorre to heare . ” An old English poem on the virtue of herbs , of the fourteenth century , says :</p>

   <p>Two hogsheads full of money were concealed in a subterraneous vault at Penyard Castle , in Herefordshire . A farmer undertook to drag them from their hiding-place , a matter of no small difficulty , for they were protected by preternatural power . To accomplish his object , he took twenty steers to draw down the iron doors of the vault in which the hogsheads were deposited . The door was partially opened , and a jackdaw was seen perched on one of the casks . The farmer was overjoyed at the prospect of success , and as soon as he saw the casks , he exclaimed , “ I believe I shall have it . ” The door immediately closed with a loud clang , and a voice in the air exclaimed —</p>

    <head>FINGER-NAILS .</head>
    <head>There is a superstition , says Forby , ii . 411 , respecting cutting the nails , and some days are considered more lucky for this operation than others . To cut them on a Tuesday is thought particularly auspicious . Indeed if we are to believe an old rhyming saw on this subject , every day of the week is endowed with its several and peculiar virtue , if the nails are invariably cut on that day and no other . The lines are as follow :</head>
     <l n="1">Cut them on Monday , you cut them for health ;</l>
     <l n="2">Cut them on Tuesday , you cut them for wealth ;</l>
     <l n="3">Cut them on Wednesday , you cut them for news ;</l>
     <l n="4">Cut them on Thursday , a new pair of shoes ;</l>
     <l n="5">Cut them on Friday , you cut them for sorrow ;</l>
     <l n="6">Cut them on Saturday , see your true love to-morrow ;</l>
     <l n="7">Cut them on Sunday , the devil will be with you all the week .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The following divination-rhymes refer to the gifts , or white spots on the nails , beginning with the thumb , and going on regularly to the little finger . The last gift will show the destiny of the operator pro tempore ,—</p>

    <head>THE MAN IN THE MOON .</head>
     <l n="1">The Man in the Moon</l>
     <l n="2">Sups his sowins with a cutty-spoon .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>A Northumberland dish called sowins , is composed of the coarse parts of oatmeal , which are put into a tub , and covered with water , and then allowed to stand till it turns sour . A portion of it is then taken out , and sapped with milk . It may easily be imagined that this is a substance not very accessible to the movements of a cutty or very small spoon .</p>
   <p>Grimm , Deutsche Mythologie , p. 412 , informs us that there are three legends connected with the Man in the Moon ; the first , that this personage was Isaac carrying a bundle of sticks for his own sacrifice ; the second , that he was Cain ; and the other , which is taken from the history of the Sabbath-breaker , as related in the Book of Numbers . The last is still generally current in this country , and is alluded to by Chaucer , and many early writers . The second is mentioned by Dante , Inferno , xx ., Cain sacrificing to the Lord thorns , the most wretched production of the ground ,—</p>
   <p>—— che gia tiene ‘ l confine D'amenduo gli emisperi , e tocca l'onda Sotto Sibilia , Caino e le spine .</p>
   <p>It appears that sowins were not the only food of the lunary inhabitant , for it is related by children he once favoured middle-earth with his presence , and took a fancy to some pease-porridge , which he was in such a hurry to devour that he scalded his mouth :</p>

   <p>X .— CUSTOM-RHYMES .</p>
   <p>It is greatly to be feared that , notwithstanding the efforts made within the last few years by individuals who have desired to see the resuscitation of the merry sports and customs of old England , the spirit which formerly characterised them is not to be recovered . The mechanical spirit of the age has thrown a degree of ridicule over observances which have not been without use in their day ; and might even now be rendered beneficial to the public , were it possible to exclude the influence which tells the humbler subject such matters are below his regard . Yet it must be confessed that most of our ancient customs are only suited to the thinly-populated rural districts , where charity , goodwill , and friendship may be delicately cultivated under the plea of their observance .</p>

   <p>Wassel or Wassal .— A remnant of this part of our Saxon manners still exists at Yarmouth , and strange to say , in no other part of the Isle of Wight . On the first day of the new year the children collect together and sing wassel or wassal through the streets ; the following is their song ( see p. 249 ):</p>

     <l n="1">Wassal , wassal , to our town !</l>
