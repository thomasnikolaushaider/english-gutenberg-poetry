    <head>THE LOVER 'S TALE , 1833 .</head>
    <head>INDEX OF FIRST LINES</head>
     <l n="1">Note</l>
   </lg>
   <p>To those unacquainted with Tennyson 's conscientious methods , it may seem strange that a volume of 160 pages is necessary to contain those poems written and published by him during his active literary career , and ultimately rejected as unsatisfactory . Of this considerable body of verse , a great part was written , not in youth or old age , but while Tennyson 's powers were at their greatest . Whatever reasons may once have existed for suppressing the poems that follow , the student of English literature is entitled to demand that the whole body of Tennyson 's work should now be open , without restriction or impediment , to the critical study to which the works of his compeers are subjected .</p>
   <p>The bibliographical notes prefixed to the various poems give , in every case , the date and medium of first publication .</p>

     <l n="1">I stood upon the Mountain which o'erlooks</l>
     <l n="2">The narrow seas , whose rapid interval</l>
     <l n="3">Parts Afric from green Europe , when the Sun</l>
     <l n="4">Had fall'n below th ’ Atlantick , and above</l>
     <l n="5">The silent Heavens were blench 'd with faery light ,</l>
     <l n="6">Uncertain whether faery light or cloud ,</l>
     <l n="7">Flowing Southward , and the chasms of deep , deep blue</l>
     <l n="8">Slumber 'd unfathomable , and the stars</l>
     <l n="9">Were flooded over with clear glory and pale .</l>
     <l n="10">I gaz 'd upon the sheeny coast beyond ,</l>
     <l n="11">There where the Giant of old Time infixed</l>
     <l n="12">The limits of his prowess , pillars high</l>
     <l n="13">Long time eras 'd from Earth : even as the sea</l>
     <l n="14">When weary of wild inroad buildeth up</l>
     <l n="15">Huge mounds whereby to stay his yeasty waves .</l>
     <l n="16">And much I mus 'd on legends quaint and old</l>
     <l n="17">Which whilome won the hearts of all on Earth</l>
     <l n="18">Toward their brightness , ev'n as flame draws air ;</l>
     <l n="19">But had their being in the heart of Man</l>
     <l n="20">As air is th ’ life of flame : and thou wert then</l>
     <l n="21">A center 'd glory-circled Memory ,</l>
     <l n="22">Divinest Atalantis , whom the waves</l>
     <l n="23">Have buried deep , and thou of later name</l>
     <l n="24">Imperial Eldorado root 'd with gold :</l>
     <l n="25">Shadows to which , despite all shocks of Change ,</l>
     <l n="26">All on-set of capricious Accident ,</l>
     <l n="27">Men clung with yearning Hope which would not die .</l>
     <l n="28">As when in some great City where the walls</l>
     <l n="29">Shake , and the streets with ghastly faces throng 'd</l>
     <l n="30">Do utter forth a subterranean voice ,</l>
     <l n="31">Among the inner columns far retir 'd</l>
     <l n="32">At midnight , in the lone Acropolis .</l>
     <l n="33">Before the awful Genius of the place</l>
     <l n="34">Kneels the pale Priestess in deep faith , the while</l>
     <l n="35">Above her head the weak lamp dips and winks</l>
     <l n="36">Unto the fearful summoning without :</l>
     <l n="37">Nathless she ever clasps the marble knees ,</l>
     <l n="38">Bathes the cold hand with tears , and gazeth on</l>
     <l n="39">Those eyes which wear no light but that wherewith</l>
     <l n="40">Her phantasy informs them .</l>

     <l n="41">Where are ye</l>
     <l n="42">Thrones of the Western wave , fair Islands green ?</l>
     <l n="43">Where are your moonlight halls , your cedarn glooms ,</l>
     <l n="44">The blossoming abysses of your hills ?</l>
     <l n="45">Your flowering Capes and your gold-sanded bays</l>
     <l n="46">Blown round with happy airs of odorous winds ?</l>
     <l n="47">Where are the infinite ways which , Seraphtrod ,</l>
     <l n="48">Wound thro ’ your great Elysian solitudes ,</l>
     <l n="49">Whose lowest depths were , as with visible love ,</l>
     <l n="50">Fill 'd with Divine effulgence , circumfus 'd ,</l>
     <l n="51">Flowing between the clear and polish 'd stems ,</l>
     <l n="52">And ever circling round their emerald cones</l>
     <l n="53">In coronals and glories , such as gird</l>
     <l n="54">The unfading foreheads of the Saints in Heaven ?</l>
     <l n="55">For nothing visible , they say , had birth</l>
     <l n="56">In that blest ground but it was play 'd about</l>
     <l n="57">With its peculiar glory . Then I rais 'd</l>
     <l n="58">My voice and cried ‘ Wide Afric , doth thy Sun</l>
     <l n="59">Lighten , thy hills enfold a City as fair</l>
     <l n="60">As those which starr 'd the night o ’ the Elder World ?</l>
     <l n="61">Or is the rumour of thy Timbuctoo</l>
     <l n="62">A dream as frail as those of ancient Time ? ’</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="63">A curve of whitening , flashing , ebbing light !</l>
     <l n="64">A rustling of white wings ! The bright descent</l>
     <l n="65">Of a young Seraph ! and he stood beside me</l>
     <l n="66">There on the ridge , and look 'd into my face</l>
     <l n="67">With his unutterable , shining orbs ,</l>
     <l n="68">So that with hasty motion I did veil</l>
     <l n="69">My vision with both hands , and saw before me</l>
     <l n="70">Such colour 'd spots as dance athwart the eyes</l>
     <l n="71">Of those that gaze upon the noonday Sun .</l>
     <l n="72">Girt with a Zone of flashing gold beneath</l>
     <l n="73">His breast , and compass 'd round about his brow</l>
     <l n="74">With triple arch of everchanging bows ,</l>
     <l n="75">And circled with the glory of living light</l>
     <l n="76">And alternations of all hues , he stood .</l>
     <l n="77">‘ O child of man , why muse you here alone</l>
     <l n="78">Upon the Mountain , on the dreams of old</l>
     <l n="79">Which fill 'd the Earth with passing loveliness ,</l>
     <l n="80">Which flung strange music on the howling winds ,</l>
     <l n="81">And odours rapt from remote Paradise ?</l>
     <l n="82">Thy sense is clogg 'd with dull mortality ,</l>
     <l n="83">Thy spirit fetter 'd with the bond of clay :</l>
     <l n="84">Open thine eye and see . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="85">I look 'd , but not</l>
     <l n="86">Upon his face , for it was wonderful</l>
     <l n="87">With its exceeding brightness , and the light</l>
     <l n="88">Of the great angel mind which look 'd from out</l>
     <l n="89">The starry glowing of his restless eyes .</l>
     <l n="90">I felt my soul grow mighty , and my spirit</l>
     <l n="91">With supernatural excitation bound</l>
     <l n="92">Within me , and my mental eye grew large</l>
     <l n="93">With such a vast circumference of thought ,</l>
     <l n="94">That in my vanity I seem 'd to stand</l>
     <l n="95">Upon the outward verge and bound alone</l>
     <l n="96">Of full beatitude . Each failing sense</l>
     <l n="97">As with a momentary flash of light</l>
     <l n="98">Grew thrillingly distinct and keen . I saw</l>
     <l n="99">The smallest grain that dappled the dark Earth ,</l>
     <l n="100">The indistinctest atom in deep air ,</l>
     <l n="101">The Moon 's white cities , and the opal width</l>
     <l n="102">Of her small glowing lakes , her silver heights</l>
     <l n="103">Unvisited with dew of vagrant cloud ,</l>
     <l n="104">And the unsounded , undescended depth</l>
     <l n="105">Of her black hollows . The clear Galaxy</l>
     <l n="106">Shorn of its hoary lustre , wonderful ,</l>
     <l n="107">Distinct and vivid with sharp points of light</l>
     <l n="108">Blaze within blaze , an unimagin 'd depth</l>
     <l n="109">And harmony of planet-girded Suns</l>
     <l n="110">And moon-encircled planets , wheel in wheel ,</l>
     <l n="111">Arch 'd the wan Sapphire . Nay , the hum of men ,</l>
     <l n="112">Or other things talking in unknown tongues ,</l>
     <l n="113">And notes of busy life in distant worlds</l>
     <l n="114">Beat like a far wave on my anxious ear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="115">A maze of piercing , trackless , thrilling thoughts</l>
     <l n="116">Involving and embracing each with each</l>
     <l n="117">Rapid as fire , inextricably link 'd ,</l>
     <l n="118">Expanding momently with every sight</l>
     <l n="119">And sound which struck the palpitating sense ,</l>
     <l n="120">The issue of strong impulse , hurried through</l>
     <l n="121">The riv'n rapt brain : as when in some large lake</l>
     <l n="122">From pressure of descendant crags , which lapse</l>
     <l n="123">Disjointed , crumbling from their parent slope</l>
     <l n="124">At slender interval , the level calm</l>
     <l n="125">Is ridg 'd with restless and increasing spheres</l>
     <l n="126">Which break upon each other , each th ’ effect</l>
     <l n="127">Of separate impulse , but more fleet and strong</l>
     <l n="128">Than its precursor , till the eyes in vain</l>
     <l n="129">Amid the wild unrest of swimming shade</l>
     <l n="130">Dappled with hollow and alternate rise</l>
     <l n="131">Of interpenetrated arc , would scan</l>
     <l n="132">Definite round .</l>
     <l n="133">I know not if I shape</l>
     <l n="134">These things with accurate similitude</l>
     <l n="135">From visible objects , for but dimly now ,</l>
     <l n="136">Less vivid than a half-forgotten dream ,</l>
     <l n="137">The memory of that mental excellence</l>
     <l n="138">Comes o'er me , and it may be I entwine</l>
     <l n="139">The indecision of my present mind</l>
     <l n="140">With its past clearness , yet it seems to me</l>
     <l n="141">As even then the torrent of quick thought</l>
     <l n="142">Absorbed me from the nature of itself</l>
     <l n="143">With its own fleetness . Where is he that , borne</l>
     <l n="144">Adown the sloping of an arrowy stream ,</l>
     <l n="145">Could link his shallop to the fleeting edge ,</l>
     <l n="146">And muse midway with philosophic calm</l>
     <l n="147">Upon the wondrous laws which regulate</l>
     <l n="148">The fierceness of the bounding element ?</l>
     <l n="149">My thoughts which long had grovell 'd in the slime</l>
     <l n="150">Of this dull world , like dusky worms which house</l>
     <l n="151">Beneath unshaken waters , but at once</l>
     <l n="152">Upon some earth-awakening day of spring</l>
     <l n="153">Do pass from gloom to glory , and aloft</l>
     <l n="154">Winnow the purple , bearing on both sides</l>
     <l n="155">Double display of starlit wings which burn</l>
     <l n="156">Fanlike and fibred , with intensest bloom :</l>
     <l n="157">E'en so my thoughts , erewhile so low , now felt</l>
     <l n="158">Unutterable buoyancy and strength</l>
     <l n="159">To bear them upward through the trackless fields</l>
     <l n="160">Of undefin 'd existence far and free .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="161">Then first within the South methought I saw</l>
     <l n="162">A wilderness of spires , and chrystal pile</l>
     <l n="163">Of rampart upon rampart , dome on dome ,</l>
     <l n="164">Illimitable range of battlement</l>
     <l n="165">On battlement , and the Imperial height</l>
     <l n="166">Of Canopy o'ercanopied .</l>
     <l n="167">Behind ,</l>
     <l n="168">In diamond light , upsprung the dazzling Cones</l>
     <l n="169">Of Pyramids , as far surpassing Earth 's</l>
     <l n="170">As Heaven than Earth is fairer . Each aloft</l>
     <l n="171">Upon his renown 'd Eminence bore globes</l>
     <l n="172">Of wheeling suns , or stars , or semblances</l>
     <l n="173">Of either , showering circular abyss</l>
     <l n="174">Of radiance . But the glory of the place</l>
     <l n="175">Stood out a pillar 'd front of burnish 'd gold</l>
     <l n="176">Interminably high , if gold it were</l>
     <l n="177">Or metal more ethereal , and beneath</l>
     <l n="178">Two doors of blinding brilliance , where no gaze</l>
     <l n="179">Might rest , stood open , and the eye could scan</l>
     <l n="180">Through length of porch and lake and boundless</l>
     <l n="181">hall ,</l>
     <l n="182">Part of a throne of fiery flame , wherefrom</l>
     <l n="183">The snowy skirting of a garment hung ,</l>
     <l n="184">And glimpse of multitudes of multitudes</l>
     <l n="185">That minister 'd around it — if I saw</l>
     <l n="186">These things distinctly , for my human brain</l>
     <l n="187">Stagger 'd beneath the vision , and thick night</l>
     <l n="188">Came down upon my eyelids , and I fell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="189">With ministering hand he rais 'd me up ;</l>
     <l n="190">Then with a mournful and ineffable smile ,</l>
     <l n="191">Which but to look on for a moment fill 'd</l>
     <l n="192">My eyes with irresistible sweet tears ,</l>
     <l n="193">In accents of majestic melody ,</l>
     <l n="194">Like a swol'n river 's gushings in still night</l>
     <l n="195">Mingled with floating music , thus he spake :</l>
     <l n="196">‘ There is no mightier Spirit than I to sway</l>
     <l n="197">The heart of man : and teach him to attain</l>
     <l n="198">By shadowing forth the Unattainable ;</l>
     <l n="199">And step by step to scale that mighty stair</l>
     <l n="200">Whose landing-place is wrapt about with clouds</l>
     <l n="201">Of glory of Heaven . [ B ] With earliest Light of Spring ,</l>
     <l n="202">And in the glow of sallow Summertide ,</l>
     <l n="203">And in red Autumn when the winds are wild</l>
     <l n="204">With gambols , and when full-voiced Winter roofs</l>
     <l n="205">The headland with inviolate white snow ,</l>
     <l n="206">I play about his heart a thousand ways ,</l>
     <l n="207">Visit his eyes with visions , and his ears</l>
     <l n="208">With harmonies of wind and wave and wood</l>
     <l n="209">— Of winds which tell of waters , and of waters</l>
     <l n="210">Betraying the close kisses of the wind —</l>
     <l n="211">And win him unto me : and few there be</l>

   <note>The following review of ‘ Timbuctoo ’ was published in the Athenæum of 22nd July , 1829 : ‘ We have accustomed ourselves to think , perhaps without any very good reason , that poetry was likely to perish among us for a considerable period after the great generation of poets which is now passing away . The age seems determined to contradict us , and that in the most decided manner ; for it has put forth poetry by a young man , and that where we should least expect it — namely , in a prize poem . These productions have often been ingenious and elegant but we have never before seen one of them which indicated really first-rate poetical genius , and which would have done honour to any men that ever wrote . Such , we do not hesitate to affirm , is the little work before us ; and the examiners seem to have felt it like ourselves , for they have assigned the prize to the author , though the measure in which he writes was never before , we believe , thus selected for honour . We extract a few lines to justify our admiration ( 50 lines , 62-112 , quoted ) . How many men have lived for a century who could equal this ? ’ At the time when this highly eulogistic notice of the youthful unknown poet appeared , the Athenæum was edited by John Sterling and Frederick Denison Maurice , its then proprietors .</note>

   <note>There was published in 1837 in The Tribute , ( a collection of original poems by various authors , edited by Lord Northampton ) , a contribution by Tennyson entitled ‘ Stanzas , ’ consisting of xvi stanzas of varying lengths ( 110 lines in all ) . In 1855 the first xii stanzas were published as the fourth section of the second part of ‘ Maud . ’ Some verbal changes and transpositions of lines were made ; a new stanza ( the present sixth ) and several new lines were introduced , and the xth stanza of 1837 became the xiiith of 1855 . But stanzas xiii-xvi of 1837 have never been reprinted in any edition of Tennyson 's works , though quoted in whole or part in various critical studies of the poet . Swinburne refers to this poem as ‘ the poem of deepest charm and fullest delight of pathos and melody ever written , even by Mr Tennyson . ’ This poem in The Tribute gained Tennyson his first notice in the Edinburgh Review , which had till then ignored him .</note>

   <note>From Punch , February 28 , 1846 . Bulwer Lytton published in 1845 his satirical poem ‘ New Timon : a Romance of London , ’ in which he bitterly attacked Tennyson for the civil list pension granted the previous year , particularly referring to the poem ‘ O Darling Room ’ in the 1833 volume . Tennyson replied in the following vigorous verses , which made the literary sensation of the year . Tennyson afterwards declared : ‘ I never sent my lines to Punch . John Forster did . They were too bitter . I do not think that I should ever have published them . ’ — Life , vol . I , p. 245 .</note>

   <p>To the Editor of The Examiner .</p>
   <p>SIR ,— I have read with much interest the poems of Merlin . The enclosed is longer than either of those , and certainly not so good : yet as I flatter myself that it has a smack of Merlin 's style in it , and as I feel that it expresses forcibly enough some of the feelings of our time , perhaps you may be induced to admit it .</p>

   <note>It was originally intended by Tennyson that this poem should form part of his 1833 volume . It was put in type and , according to custom , copies were distributed among his friends , when , on the eve of publication , he decided to omit it . Again , in 1869 , it was sent to press with a new third part added , and was again withdrawn , the third part only — ‘ The Golden Supper , ’ founded on a story in Boccaccio 's Decameron — being published in the volume , ‘ The Holy Grail . ’ In 1866 , 1870 and 1875 , attempts had been made by Mr Herne Shepherd to publish editions of ‘ The Lover 's Tale , ’ reprinted from stray proof copies of the 1833 printing . Each of these attempts was repressed by Tennyson , and at last in 1879 the complete poem , as now included in the collected Works , was issued , with an apologetic reference to the necessity of reprinting the poem to prevent its circulation in an unauthorised form . But the 1879 issue is considerably altered from the original issue of 1833 , as written by Tennyson in his nineteenth year . Since only as a product of Tennyson 's youth does the poem merit any attention , it has seemed good to reprint it here as originally written .</note>

    <head>A FRAGMENT</head>
    <head>The Poem of the Lover 's Tale ( the lover is supposed to be himself a poet ) was written in my nineteenth year , and consequently contains nearly as many faults as words . That I deemed it not wholly unoriginal is my only apology for its publication — an apology lame and poor , and somewhat impertinent to boot : so that if its infirmities meet with more laughter than charity in the world , I shall not raise my voice in its defence . I am aware how deficient the Poem is in point of art , and it is not without considerable misgivings that I have ventured to publish even this fragment of it . ‘ Enough , ’ says the old proverb , ‘ is as good as a feast . ’ — ( Tennyson 's original introductory note . )</head>

     <l n="1">Here far away , seen from the topmost cliff ,</l>
     <l n="2">Filling with purple gloom the vacancies</l>
     <l n="3">Between the tufted hills the sloping seas</l>
     <l n="4">Hung in mid-heaven , and half-way down rare sails ,</l>
     <l n="5">White as white clouds , floated from sky to sky .</l>
     <l n="6">Oh ! pleasant breast of waters , quiet bay ,</l>
     <l n="7">Like to a quiet mind in the loud world ,</l>
     <l n="8">Where the chafed breakers of the outer sea</l>
     <l n="9">Sunk powerless , even as anger falls aside ,</l>
     <l n="10">And withers on the breast of peaceful love ,</l>
     <l n="11">Thou didst receive that belt of pines , that fledged</l>
     <l n="12">The hills that watch 'd thee , as Love watcheth Love ,—</l>
     <l n="13">In thine own essence , and delight thyself</l>
     <l n="14">To make it wholly thine on sunny days .</l>
     <l n="15">Keep thou thy name of ‘ Lover 's bay ': See , Sirs ,</l>
     <l n="16">Even now the Goddess of the Past , that takes</l>
     <l n="17">The heart , and sometimes toucheth but one string ,</l>
     <l n="18">That quivers , and is silent , and sometimes</l>
     <l n="19">Sweeps suddenly all its half-moulder 'd chords</l>
     <l n="20">To an old melody , begins to play</l>
     <l n="21">On those first-moved fibres of the brain .</l>
     <l n="22">I come , Great mistress of the ear and eye :</l>
     <l n="23">Oh ! lead me tenderly , for fear the mind</l>
     <l n="24">Rain thro ’ my sight , and strangling sorrow weigh</l>
     <l n="25">Mine utterance with lameness . Tho ’ long years</l>
     <l n="26">Have hallowed out a valley and a gulf</l>
     <l n="27">Betwixt the native land of Love and me ,</l>
     <l n="28">Breathe but a little on me , and the sail</l>
     <l n="29">Will draw me to the rising of the sun ,</l>
     <l n="30">The lucid chambers of the morning star ,</l>
     <l n="31">And East of life .</l>
     <l n="32">Permit me , friend , I prithee ,</l>
     <l n="33">To pass my hand across my brows , and muse</l>
     <l n="34">On those dear hills , that nevermore will meet</l>
     <l n="35">The sight that throbs and aches beneath my touch ,</l>
     <l n="36">As tho ’ there beat a heart in either eye ;</l>
     <l n="37">For when the outer lights are darken 'd thus ,</l>
     <l n="38">The memory 's vision hath a keener edge .</l>
     <l n="39">It grows upon me now — the semicircle</l>
     <l n="40">Of dark blue waters and the narrow fringe</l>
     <l n="41">Of curving beach — its wreaths of dripping green —</l>
     <l n="42">Its pale pink shells — the summer-house aloft</l>
     <l n="43">That open 'd on the pines with doors of glass ,</l>
     <l n="44">A mountain nest the pleasure boat that rock 'd</l>
     <l n="45">Light-green with its own shadow , keel to keel ,</l>
     <l n="46">Upon the crispings of the dappled waves</l>
     <l n="47">That blanched upon its side .</l>
     <l n="48">O Love , O Hope ,</l>
     <l n="49">They come , they crowd upon me all at once ,</l>
     <l n="50">Moved from the cloud of unforgotten things ,</l>
     <l n="51">That sometimes on the horizon of the mind</l>
     <l n="52">Lies folded — often sweeps athwart in storm —</l>
     <l n="53">They flash across the darkness of my brain ,</l>
     <l n="54">The many pleasant days , the moolit nights ,</l>
     <l n="55">The dewy dawnings and the amber eyes ,</l>
     <l n="56">When thou and I , Camilla , thou and I</l>
     <l n="57">Were borne about the bay , or safely moor 'd</l>
     <l n="58">Beneath some low brow 'd cavern , where the wave</l>
     <l n="59">Plash 'd sapping its worn ribs ( the while without ,</l>
     <l n="60">And close above us , sang the wind-tost pine ,</l>
     <l n="61">And shook its earthly socket , for we heard ,</l>
     <l n="62">In rising and in falling with the tide ,</l>
     <l n="63">Close by our ears , the huge roots strain and creak ) ,</l>
     <l n="64">Eye feeding upon eye with deep intent ;</l>
     <l n="65">And mine , with love too high to be express 'd</l>
     <l n="66">Arrested in its sphere , and ceasing from</l>
     <l n="67">All contemplation of all forms , did pause</l>
     <l n="68">To worship mine own image , laved in light ,</l>
     <l n="69">The centre of the splendours , all unworthy</l>
     <l n="70">Of such a shrine — mine image in her eyes ,</l>
     <l n="71">By diminution made most glorious ,</l>
     <l n="72">Moved with their motions , as those eyes were moved</l>
     <l n="73">With motions of the soul , as my heart beat</l>
     <l n="74">Twice to the melody of hers . Her face</l>
     <l n="75">Was starry-fair , not pale , tenderly flush 'd</l>
     <l n="76">As ‘ twere with dawn . She was dark-hair 'd , dark-eyed ;</l>
     <l n="77">Oh , such dark eyes ! A single glance of them</l>
     <l n="78">Will govern a whole life from birth to death ,</l>
     <l n="79">Careless of all things else , led on with light</l>
     <l n="80">In trances and in visions : look at them ,</l>
     <l n="81">You lose yourself in utter ignorance ,</l>
     <l n="82">You cannot find their depth ; for they go back ,</l>
     <l n="83">And farther back , and still withdraw themselves</l>
     <l n="84">Quite into the deep soul , that evermore ,</l>
     <l n="85">Fresh springing from her fountains in the brain ,</l>
     <l n="86">Still pouring thro ’ , floods with redundant light</l>
     <l n="87">Her narrow portals .</l>

     <l n="93">Thine image , like a charm of light and strength</l>

     <l n="97">Fell into dust , and crumbled in the dark —</l>

     <l n="107">Of thought , and freshness ever self-renew 'd .</l>
     <l n="108">For Time and Grief abode too long with Life ,</l>

     <l n="115">‘ This is a charmed dwelling which I hold ’ ;</l>
     <l n="116">So Death gave back , and would no further come .</l>
     <l n="117">Yet is my life nor in the present time ,</l>
     <l n="118">Nor in the present place . To me alone ,</l>
     <l n="119">Pushed from his chair of regal heritage ,</l>
     <l n="120">The Present is the vassal of the Past :</l>
     <l n="121">So that , in that I have lived , do I live ,</l>

     <l n="126">The lithe limbs bow 'd as with a heavy weight</l>
     <l n="127">And all the senses weaken 'd in all save that</l>

     <l n="131">Now seam 'd and chink 'd with years — and all the while</l>

     <l n="134">Married , made one with , molten into all</l>
     <l n="135">The beautiful in Past of act or place .</l>

     <l n="301">It was a glorious morning , such a one</l>
     <l n="302">As dawns but once a season . Mercury</l>
     <l n="303">On such a morning would have flung himself</l>
     <l n="304">From cloud to cloud , and swum with balanced wings</l>
     <l n="305">To some tall mountain . On that day the year</l>
     <l n="306">First felt his youth and strength , and from his spring</l>
     <l n="307">Moved smiling toward his summer . On that day ,</l>
     <l n="308">Love working shook his wings ( that charged the winds</l>
     <l n="309">With spiced May-sweets from bound to bound ) and blew</l>
     <l n="310">Fresh fire into the sun , and from within</l>
     <l n="311">Burst thro ’ the heated buds , and sent his soul</l>
     <l n="312">Into the songs of birds , and touch 'd far-off</l>
     <l n="313">His mountain-altars , his high hills , with flame</l>
     <l n="314">Milder and purer . Up the rocks we wound ;</l>
     <l n="315">The great pine shook with lovely sounds of joy ,</l>
     <l n="316">That came on the sea-wind . As mountain brooks</l>
     <l n="317">Our blood ran free : the sunshine seem 'd to brood</l>
     <l n="318">More warmly on the heart than on the brow .</l>
     <l n="319">We often paused , and looking back , we saw</l>
     <l n="320">The clefts and openings in the hills all fill 'd</l>
     <l n="321">With the blue valley and the glistening brooks ,</l>
     <l n="322">And with the low dark groves — a land of Love ;</l>
     <l n="323">Where Love was worshipp 'd upon every height ,</l>
     <l n="324">Where Love was worshipp 'd under every tree —</l>
     <l n="325">A land of promise , flowing with the milk</l>
     <l n="326">And honey of delicious memories</l>
     <l n="327">Down to the sea , as far as eye could ken ,</l>
     <l n="328">From verge to verge it was a holy land ,</l>
     <l n="329">Still growing holier as you near 'd the bay ,</l>
     <l n="330">For where the temple stood . When we had reach 'd</l>
     <l n="331">The grassy platform on some hill , I stoop 'd ,</l>
     <l n="332">I gather 'd the wild herbs , and for her brows</l>
     <l n="333">And mine wove chaplets of the self-same flower ,</l>
     <l n="334">Which she took smiling , and with my work there</l>
     <l n="335">Crown 'd her clear forehead . Once or twice she told me</l>
     <l n="336">( For I remember all things ) , to let grow</l>
     <l n="337">The flowers that run poison in their veins .</l>
     <l n="338">She said , ‘ The evil flourish in the world ’ ;</l>
     <l n="339">Then playfully she gave herself the lie :</l>
     <l n="340">‘ Nothing in nature is unbeautiful ,</l>
     <l n="341">So , brother , pluck and spare not . ’ So I wove</l>
     <l n="342">Even the dull-blooded poppy , ‘ whose red flower</l>
     <l n="343">Hued with the scarlet of a fierce sunrise ,</l>
     <l n="344">Like to the wild youth of an evil king ,</l>
     <l n="345">Is without sweetness , but who crowns himself</l>
     <l n="346">Above the secret poisons of his heart</l>
     <l n="347">In his old age ’ — a graceful thought of hers</l>
     <l n="348">Graven on my fancy ! As I said , with these</l>
     <l n="349">She crown 'd her forehead . O how like a nymph ,</l>
     <l n="350">A stately mountain-nymph , she look 'd ! how native</l>
     <l n="351">Unto the hills she trod on ! What an angel !</l>
     <l n="352">How clothed with beams ! My eyes , fix 'd upon hers ,</l>
     <l n="353">Almost forgot even to move again .</l>
     <l n="354">My spirit leap 'd as with those thrills of bliss</l>
     <l n="355">That shoot across the soul in prayer , and show us</l>
     <l n="356">That we are surely heard . Methought a light</l>

     <l n="358">A solid glory on her bright black hair :</l>
     <l n="359">A light , methought , broke from her dark , dark eyes ,</l>
     <l n="360">And shot itself into the singing winds ;</l>
     <l n="361">A light , methought , flash 'd even from her white robe ,</l>
     <l n="362">As from a glass in the sun , and fell about</l>

     <l n="371">Sheer thro ’ the black-wall 'd cliff the rapid brook</l>

     <l n="377">We mounted slowly : yet to both of us</l>

     <l n="686">Oh , how her love did clothe itself in smiles</l>
     <l n="687">About his lips ! This was the very arch-mock</l>
     <l n="688">And insolence of uncontrolled Fate ,</l>
     <l n="689">When the effect weigh 'd seas upon my head</l>
     <l n="690">To twit me with the cause .</l>
     <l n="691">Why how was this ?</l>

     <l n="699">The East , the West , all open , if he had fall'n</l>
     <l n="700">In love in twilight ? Why should he come my way ,</l>
     <l n="701">Robed in those robes of light I must not wear ,</l>
     <l n="702">With that great crown of beams about his brows ?</l>
     <l n="703">Come like an angel to a damned soul ?</l>
     <l n="704">To tell him of the bliss he had with God ;</l>
     <l n="705">Come like a careless and a greedy heir ,</l>
     <l n="706">That scarce can wait the reading of the will</l>
     <l n="707">Before he takes possession ? Was mine a mood</l>
     <l n="708">To be invaded rudely , and not rather</l>
     <l n="709">A sacred , secret , unapproached woe</l>
     <l n="710">Unspeakable ? I was shut up with grief ;</l>
     <l n="711">She took the body of my past delight ,</l>
     <l n="712">Narded , and swathed and balm 'd it for herself ,</l>
     <l n="713">And laid it in a new-hewn sepulchre ,</l>
     <l n="714">Where man had never lain . I was led mute</l>
     <l n="715">Into her temple like a sacrifice ;</l>
     <l n="716">I was the high-priest in her holiest place ,</l>
     <l n="717">Not to be loudly broken in upon .</l>
     <l n="718">Oh ! friend , thoughts deep and heavy as these well-nigh</l>
     <l n="719">O'erbore the limits of my brain ; but he</l>
     <l n="720">Bent o'er me , and my neck his arm upstay 'd</l>
     <l n="721">From earth . I thought it was an adder 's fold ,</l>
     <l n="722">And once I strove to disengage myself ,</l>
     <l n="723">But fail 'd , I was so feeble . She was there too :</l>
     <l n="724">She bent above me too : her cheek was pale ,</l>
     <l n="725">Oh ! very fair and pale : rare pity had stolen</l>
     <l n="726">The living bloom away , as tho ’ a red rose</l>
     <l n="727">Should change into a white one suddenly .</l>
     <l n="728">Her eyes , I saw , were full of tears in the morn ,</l>
     <l n="729">And some few drops of that distressful rain</l>
     <l n="730">Being wafted on the wind , drove in my sight ,</l>
     <l n="731">And being there they did break forth afresh</l>
     <l n="732">In a new birth , immingled with my own ,</l>
     <l n="733">And still bewept my grief . Keeping unchanged</l>
     <l n="734">The purport of their coinage . Her long ringlets ,</l>
     <l n="735">Drooping and beaten with the plaining wind ,</l>
     <l n="736">Did brush my forehead in their to-and-fro :</l>
     <l n="737">For in the sudden anguish of her heart</l>
     <l n="738">Loosed from their simple thrall they had flowed abroad ,</l>
     <l n="739">And onward floating in a full , dark wave ,</l>
     <l n="740">Parted on either side her argent neck ,</l>
     <l n="741">Mantling her form half way . She , when I woke ,</l>
     <l n="742">After my refluent health made tender quest</l>
     <l n="743">Unanswer 'd , for I spoke not : for the sound</l>
     <l n="744">Of that dear voice so musically low ,</l>
     <l n="745">And now first heard with any sense of pain ,</l>
     <l n="746">As it had taken life away before ,</l>
     <l n="747">Choked all the syllables that in my throat</l>
     <l n="748">Strove to uprise , laden with mournful thanks ,</l>
     <l n="749">From my full heart : and ever since that hour ,</l>
     <l n="750">My voice hath somewhat falter 'd — and what wonder</l>
     <l n="751">That when hope died , part of her eloquence</l>
     <l n="752">Died with her ? He , the blissful lover , too ,</l>
     <l n="753">From his great hoard of happiness distill 'd</l>
     <l n="754">Some drops of solace ; like a vain rich man ,</l>
     <l n="755">That , having always prosper 'd in the world ,</l>
     <l n="756">Folding his hands deals comfortable words</l>
     <l n="757">To hearts wounded for ever ; yet , in truth ,</l>
     <l n="758">Fair speech was his and delicate of phrase ,</l>
     <l n="759">Falling in whispers on the sense , address 'd</l>
     <l n="760">More to the inward than the outward ear ,</l>
     <l n="761">As rain of the midsummer midnight soft</l>
     <l n="762">Scarce-heard , recalling fragrance and the green</l>
     <l n="763">Of the dead spring — such as in other minds</l>
     <l n="764">Had film 'd the margents of the recent wound .</l>

     <l n="769">Because my hope was widow 'd , like the cur</l>
     <l n="770">In the child 's adage ? Did I love Camilla ?</l>

     <l n="777">Should kiss with an unwonted gentleness .</l>
     <l n="778">Her love did murder mine ; what then ? she deem 'd</l>

     <l n="844">Who never hail 'd another worth the Life</l>
     <l n="845">That made it sensible . So died that hour ,</l>

      <l n="1060">A monument of childhood and of love ,</l>
      <l n="1061">The poesy of childhood ; my lost love</l>

      <l n="1075">Rapid and vast , of hissing spray wind-driven</l>
      <l n="1076">Far through the dizzy dark . Aloud she shriek 'd —</l>

      <l n="1081">And parted lips which drank her breath , down hung</l>
      <l n="1082">The jaws of Death : I , screaming , from me flung</l>
      <l n="1083">The empty phantom : all the sway and whirl</l>
      <l n="1084">Of the storm dropt to windless calm , and I</l>
