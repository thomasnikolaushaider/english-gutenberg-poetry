    <docTitle><titlePart>ENTHUSIASM . Oh for the spirit which inspired of old The seer 's prophetic song — the voice that spake Through Israel 's warrior king . The strains that burst In thrilling tones from Zion 's heaven-strung harp , Float down the tide of ages , shedding light On pagan shores and nations far remote : Eternal as the God they celebrate , Their fame shall last when Time 's long race is run , And you refulgent eye of this fair world ,— Its light and centre ,— into darkness shrinks , Eclipsed for ever by the glance of Him Whose rising sheds abroad eternal day . Almighty , uncreated Source of life ! To Thee I dedicate my soul and song ; In humble adoration bending low Before thy footstool . Thou alone canst stamp A lasting glory on the works of man , Tuning the shepherd 's reed , or monarch 's harp , To sounds harmonious . Immortality Exists alone in Thee . The proudest strain That ever fired the poet 's soul , or drew Melodious breathings from his gifted lyre , Unsanctioned by thy smile , shall die away Like the faint sound which the soft summer breeze Wins from the stately lily 's silver bells ; A passing murmur , a half-whispered sigh , Heard for a moment in the deep repose Of Nature 's midnight rest — then hushed for ever ! Parent of genius , bright Enthusiasm ! Bold nurse of high resolve and generous thought , ‘ Tis to thy soul-awakening power we owe The preacher 's eloquence , the painter 's skill , The poet 's lay , the patriot 's noble zeal , The warrior 's courage , and the sage 's lore . Oh ! till the soul is quickened by thy breath , Wit , wisdom , eloquence , and beauty , fail To make a just impression on the heart ; The tide of life creeps lazily along , Soiled with the stains of earth , and man debased Sinks far below the level of the stream . Alas ! that thy bright flame should be confined To passion 's maddening vortex ; and the soul Waste all its glorious energies on earth !— The world allows its votaries to feel A glowing ardour , an intense delight , On every subject but the one that lifts The soul above its sensual , vain pursuits , And elevates the mind and thoughts to God ! Zeal in a sacred cause alone is deemed An aberration of our mental powers . The sons of pleasure cannot bear that light Of heavenly birth which penetrates the souls Of men , who , deeply conscious of their guilt , Mourn o'er their lost , degraded state , and seek , Through faith in Christ 's atonement , to regain The glorious liberty of sons of God ! Who , as redeemed , account it their chief joy To praise and celebrate the wondrous love That called them out of darkness into light ,— Severed the chain which bound them to the dust , Unclosed the silent portals of the grave , And gave Hope wings to soar again to heaven !— Oh , thou bright spirit , of whose power I sing , Electric , deathless energy of mind , Harp of the soul , by genius swept , awake ! Inspire my strains , and aid me to portray The base and joyless vanities which man Madly prefers to everlasting bliss !— Come ! let us mount gay Fancy 's rapid car , And trace through forest and o'er mountain rude The bounding footsteps of the youthful bard , Yet new to life — a stranger to the woes His harp is doomed to mourn in plaintive tones . His ardent unsophisticated mind , On all things beautiful , delighted , dwells . Earth is to him a paradise . No cloud Floats o'er the golden promise of the morn . Hope daily weaves fresh roses for his brow , Shrouding the grim and ghastly phantom , Death , Beneath her soft and rainbow-tinted wings . Ere Care has tainted with her poisonous breath Life 's opening buds , all objects wear to him A lovely aspect , and he peoples space With creatures of his own . The glorious forms Which haunt his solitude , and brightly fill Imagination 's airy hall , atone For all the faults and follies of his kind . Nor marvel that he cannot comprehend The speculative aims of worldly men : Dearer to him a leaf , or bursting bud , Culled fresh from Nature 's treasury , than all The golden dreams that cheat the care-worn crowd . His world is all within . He mingles not In their society ; he cannot drudge To win the wealth they toil to realize . A different spirit animates his breast . Their eager calculations , hopes , and fears , Still flit before him , like dim shadows thrown By April 's passing clouds upon the stream , A moment mirrored in its azure depths , Till the next sunbeam turns them into light !— Rashly confiding , still to be deceived , Our youthful poet overleaps the bounds Of probability . He walks this earth Like an enfranchised spirit ; and the storms , That darken and convulse a guilty world , Come like faint peals of thunder on his ear , Or hoarser murmurs of the mighty deep , Which heard in some dark forest 's leafy shade But add a solemn grandeur to the scene .— The genial tide of thought still swiftly flows Rejoicing onward , ere the icy breath Of sorrow falls upon the sunny fount , And chains the music of its dancing waves .— What is the end of all his lovely dreams — The bright fulfilment of his earthly hopes ? Too often penury and dire disease , Neglect , a broken heart , an early grave !— Oh , had he tuned his harp to truths divine , With saints and martyrs sought a heavenly crown , How had his theme immortalized his song !— Behold the man , who to the poet 's fire Unites the painter 's fascinating art ; His touch embodies all that fancy brings To charm the mental vision , and he dives Into the rich and shadowy world of thought , Soars up to heaven , or plunges down to hell , In search of forms to mortal eyes unknown , To animate the canvass . His bold eye Confronts the king of terrors . Through the gates Of that dark prison-house of woe and dread Hails the infernal monarch on his throne , Crowned with ambition 's diadem of fire .— Unsatisfied with all that Nature gives To charm the wandering heart and roving eye , He would portray Omnipotence .— Rash man ! Reason revolting shudders at the act .— God is a Spirit without form or parts ; And canst thou , from a human model , trace The awful grandeur of Creation 's King ? Nature supplies thee with no perfect draught Of human beauty in its sinless state . Man bears upon his brow the curse of guilt , The shadow of mortality , that marks , E'en in the sunny season of his youth , The melancholy sentence of decay .— Is it from such the painter would depict The vision of Jehovah ?— and from eyes , Dimmed with the tears of passion , woe , and pain , Seek to portray the dread all-seeing eye , Which at a momentary glance can read The inmost secrets of all hearts , and pierce The dark and fathomless abyss of night ? Oh , drop the pencil !— Angels cannot gaze On Him who sits upon the jasper throne , Robed in the splendour of immortal light ; But cast their crowns before him whilst they veil The brow in rapt devotion and adore !— Nature will furnish subjects far beyond The grasp of human genius . Didst thou e'er , On mossy bank or grassy plot reclined , Watch the effect of sunlight on the boughs Of some tall graceful ash , or maple tree ? Each leaf illumin 'd by the noon-tide beam Transparent shines .— Anon a heavy cloud Floats for a moment o'er the car of day , And gloom descends upon the forest bowers ; A ray steals forth — and on the topmost twig Falls , like a silver star . From leaf to leaf The glory spreads , shoots down the rugged trunk And gilds each spray , till the whole tree stands forth Arrayed in light .— This is beyond thy art . All thy enthusiasm , all thy boasted skill , But poorly imitates a forest tree . But let us leave the painter . Let us turn To those , who never swept the sounding lyre Or grasped the pencil ,— ardent minds that hold A deep communion with the winds and waves , The youthful worshippers at Nature 's shrine : What says the soft voice of the plaintive breeze , Mournfully sweeping through the forest boughs , In airy play moved gently by its breath ? To such it hath a language , and it wins A tender echo from the youthful heart .— With throbbing bosom Nature 's student treads The sylvan haunts , exultingly leaps forth To hail the coming of the genial spring , Shedding around from her green lap the buds , In winter 's rugged casket long enshrined , To form the chaplet of the infant year .— Young pensive moralist !— ‘ tis sweet to muse On beauties which escape the vulgar eye , To talk with Nature ‘ mid her woodland paths , And hear an answering voice in every breeze .— You court her beauties with a lover 's zeal ; You hear her voice , nor understand the sound Which speaks to you — to all . The volume spread Before your dazzled eyes , so rich with life , Is a closed book — a fair illumined scroll , Traced in strange characters , unknown to you . Would you unfold the mystery , and read The record the eternal hand of God Has , of himself , on Nature 's tablets graved ? You must explore another wondrous book , Of deeper interest far — the book of life — The glorious volume of unsullied truth !— Time 's rapid and undeviating march Tramples down empires , blots out names that once Bid fair for perpetuity of fame . Truth is alone eternal as the God Who on this everlasting basis placed His own immutable and moveless throne . Time to these writings daily adds new force , Deepening the traces of Jehovah 's love , His fathomless , unbounded love to man .— Peruse this volume , and then walk abroad And meditate in silence on the scenes Which lately charmed your unassisted sense , Till your soul burns within you , and breaks forth In holy hymns of gratitude and praise .— Faith gives a grandeur to created things , Beyond the poet 's lay or painter 's art , Or upward flight of Fancy 's eagle wing ;— Earth is the vista through which heaven is seen By him who , journeying through life 's narrow vale , Seeks in the objects which around him rise To hold communion with his God ! to trace The wisdom , goodness , majesty , and love , That clothed the lilies of the field , and twined The simple diadem of buds and leaves , So rich in their diversity of shade , Round Nature 's brow ,— and o'er the rugged hills Cast the light floating veil of purple haze , Which harmonizes to its own soft hue The broken precipice and barren heath . Here admiration may have ample scope : The spirit soaring upward drinks in light From other worlds , and in the choral song Of happy birds among the forest bowers , Hears the seraphic and harmonious strains That angels chant around the eternal throne !— To him there is an anthem in the breeze , A burst of triumph in the thunder 's peal , Which , slowly rolling through the troubled air , Strikes man with terror , and yet praises God !—</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>O'er Fancy 's glass another shadow flits , Which shows a bolder aspect than the gay Impassioned votaries of Nature wear . Mark his majestic port , his eagle eye , The stern erection of his haughty brow , Partially shaded by the snowy plumes That lightly wave and wanton in the breeze .— Is this a pensioner of hope ?— Is this A dreamer of wild dreams ?— All eyes are turned To gaze upon him , as with measured step The weaponed warrior slowly passes by .— Oh , this is one of War 's tremendous sons , Glory 's intrepid champion : his stout heart Leaps , as the war-horse , to the trumpet 's sound , And hails the storm of battle from afar . He loves the press , the tumult , and the strife , Where horror holds the gory steeds of death , And slaughter hews a passage for the brave !— He too is an enthusiast !— his zeal Impels him onward with resistless force , Severs his heart from nature 's kindred ties , And feeds the wild ambition which consumes All that is good and lovely in his path . He flashes , like a meteor , on the sight , Seen ‘ mid the angry thunder-clouds of war , Seeking a living name in fields where Death Holds his imperial banquet , and the blood Of thousands flows to furnish forth the feast . There was a time when softer feelings held Their mild dominion o'er that haughty breast ; When at his mother 's feet , a rosy boy , He wove bright garlands for his artless brow , And sought , with playful dalliance , to detain The busy hand that could not pause to bind His cumbrous wreath , or answer the caress Of him who climbed her knees to steal the kiss . But even at those tender years , his braid Of April blossoms was his crown ; the twig Of golden willow , with white daisies bound , His jewelled sceptre ; and the mossy bank , Where he reclined in floral state , his throne ; The lambs that sported in the yellow meads His lawful subjects ; while his azure eye Looked up to heaven with all a child 's delight , And thought that earth was only made for him .— How often has he wept for that fair moon , That shed her trembling glory o'er his path ; Wearied his slender limbs to reach the spot On which the rainbow based its splendid arch , And felt his heart with disappointment beat When the fair pageant faded from his view .— Ah , simple boy !— well had it been for thee Had thy ambitious longings been confined To objects wisely placed beyond thy grasp . But years stole on — thy ardent spirit broke Its childish trammels , and with eager joy Explored the warlike annals of the past , And called up spirits of the mighty dead , To set their hostile armies in array , And fight for thee their sanguine battles o'er . Oh , while such visions burst upon thy sight , Whilst shouts of victory and dying groans Rang on thine ear — time backward rolled his tide , Rome in her ancient splendour proudly rose , And murdered Cæsar lived again in thee ! Young fiery soldier !— let us track thy steps Through danger 's stormy paths , to win the goal Of all thy lofty and ambitious hopes . Wedded to glory , thy brave heart springs forth To win thy bride from valour 's armed hand , And pluck the laurel from the brow of death . A novice in the camp and new to arms , The bugle lulls thee to repose , the trumpet Thrills on thy sleeping ear , and bids thee dream Of deathless fields in fancy fought and won . At length the day of trial comes — the day Which puts thy boasted courage to the proof — Thy first in battle , and perchance thy last . The camp is broken up , the air is rent With strains of martial music , the loud neigh Of prancing steeds , impatient for the strife , With clang of arms , and oft-repeated shouts Of warriors , who impatiently leap forth With reckless hardihood to meet their doom . With beating heart , firm step , and flashing eye , The young recruit of glory proudly grasps The standard he must only yield with life . The march commences — deep excitement grows To fiery expectation — he forgets , Amidst the hurried interest of the scene , The crown he fights for only can be won Through seas of slaughter and the waste of life . Alas ! how few devoted hearts like his Survive their first engagement with the foe . Death strikes the hero to the dust . He falls In honour 's mantle , the triumphant cry Of victory on his pallid lip expires ! But what are conquests of the bow and spear , And Alexander 's victories , compared With the stern warfare which the soul maintains Against the subtle tempter of mankind — The base corruptions of a sinful world — An evil conscience and a callous heart ? Oh , vanquish these !— and through the gates of death Triumphant pass and win a heavenly crown !— Oh , that my soul could find a voice to speak ; That human language could express the thoughts Which fill the secret chambers of the brain . In vain the lips pour forth harmonious sounds ; In vain the eager eye is raised to heaven , Swimming in tears , and bright with ecstasy ,— The senses still are debtors to the heart , Which , trembling , throbs for utterance in vain . Does the salvation of a deathless soul Kindle no hope in the possessor 's breast ? Awaken no desire to be restored To that most pure and perfect state of bliss Man by transgression lost ?— the noble thought Of claiming kindred with the skies , give birth To no anticipations of delight — Joys such as angels share , and saints , who dwell Within the circle of Jehovah 's throne ? A light is breaking on my mental eye ; Visions of glory in succession rise And fill the airy palace of the soul . I see afar the promised land . An arch Of golden radiance canopies the gates Of that celestial city — Beautiful ! Unbuilt by hands — the New Jerusalem — And holy to the Lord ; the happy home Of pilgrims , who to reach that heavenly shrine Sojourned as strangers on this goodly earth , Counting all things but loss — yea , life itself — To win an entrance through those gates of pearl , And dwell within the temple of their God ! Alas ! earth 's dusky shadow lies between My ardent spirit and that blissful shore : Eye hath not seen , nor mortal ear hath heard , How then can mortal pen portray , the joys Prepared for those who live and die in Christ ! Before me flows the rapid stream of time , Dark , fathomless , encumbered with the wrecks Of twice three thousand years . They too shall sink Beneath those turbid waters , swallowed up In the vast ocean of eternity ; Leaving few fragments on the boundless waste To tell to coming years that such have been . How shall the naked spirit cross the flood , And land in safety on the happy shore ? ‘ Tis not an earthly pilot that can steer So frail a bark through such a stormy tide . Cannot the eye of faith look up and see The clouds of sorrow part — the day-star rise Above life 's trackless ocean , shedding light Upon the darkened nations ? From its beams The mist of error flies , the angry waves Of passion , which so long have vexed the world , Are hushed to rest ; controlled by Him who rose From tranquil sleep , and to the roaring waste Of midnight waters , mustering all their wrath , Said , “ Peace , be still . ” The howling winds obeyed , And silence sank upon the storm-tossed main !— Oh look to Him ! and to his glorious word . His universal sovereignty demands That deep devotion of the heart which men Miscall enthusiasm !— Zeal alone deserves The name of madness in a worldly cause . Light misdirected ever leads astray ; But hope inspired by faith will guide to heaven ! To win the laurel wreath the soldier fights ; To free his native land the patriot bleeds ; And to secure his crown the martyr dies ! For beauteous Rachel Isaac 's son endured Seven years of bitter servitude , and deemed The weary months but moments to obtain From crafty Laban 's hand his promised bride . To prove his friendship for the man he loved , The generous Jonathan forgot his claims To royalty , intent to save the life Of him whom God had called to fill his throne . And wilt thou feel less zealous to regain The love and favour of thy heavenly King , And shrink because the path to glory lies Up the steep hill of duty ? He who saved , Amidst the tempest on Gennesaret , Peter , when sinking in the waves , will aid Thy feeble steps , and guide thee to the rock Of everlasting strength !—</docImprint>

     <p>Spirit divine ! Whose name I erst invoked , whose influence fills The narrow confines of this human breast ,— If I have dared to sing of truths sublime , Oh , shed a glory round my rugged lyre — Hallow the feeble strains that would reveal The dazzling light , which streaming from thy wings , Gilds all the dark and troubled tide of thought . Lifted by thee above the gulf of time My eye explores the regions of the blessed , And hopes long chained to earth are raised to heaven . Never , while reason holds her steady rein , To curb imagination 's fiery steeds , May I to joyless apathy resign The high and holy thoughts inspired by thee ! FAME . Oh ye ! who all life 's energies combine The fadeless laurel round your brows to twine , Pause but one moment in your brief career , Nor seek for glory in a mortal sphere . Can figures traced upon the shifting sand Washed by the mighty tide , its force withstand ? Time 's stern resistless torrent onward flows , The restless waves above your labours close , And He who bids the bounding billows roll Sweeps out the feeble record from the soul . The glorious hues that flush the evening sky Melt into night , and on her bosom die ; Through the wide fields of heaven 's immensity The gold-tipped billows of that crimson sea Flash on the awe-struck gazer 's dazzled sight , The rich out-gushings from the fount of light ; Yet oft , concealed beneath that splendid form , We hail the herald of the coming storm ; The fiery spirit over half a globe Spreads the bright tissue of his beamy robe , And , ere the day-king veils his glowing crest , Shrouds the dark tempest in his burning vest ; O'er earth and heaven his gorgeous banner flings , And gilds with borrowed light his sable wings — And those who view with rapture-lifted eyes The short-lived pageant of the summer skies , Behold it vanish like a fearful dream , And death and desolation mar its beam . So when we seek above life 's sea of tears To raise a monument for future years , If built on earth the fabric will decay , Oblivion 's hand will sweep the pile away ; The proudest trophies of the mightiest mind Fade in her grasp , nor leave a wreck behind ; She o'er earth 's ruins spreads her misty pall , And time 's unsparing ocean swallows all ; Hope for a moment gilds the spoiler 's shroud , As parting sunbeams tinge the lurid cloud ; The transient glory cheats the gazer 's sight ; The storm rolls on — ‘ tis universal night ! Say did not man inherit , at his birth , A higher promise than the things of earth ; Views more exalted than this world can give , And hopes that , deathless as the soul , outlive The wreck of nature , and the common doom That hourly sweeps her myriads to the tomb ? His mental powers , unfettered by the clod , Soar o'er time 's gulf , and reach the throne of God . Oh what a privilege it is to know That death chains not the immortal soul below ! Through the dark portals of the grave upborne , Leaving the care-worn sons of earth to mourn , On wings of light the new-born spirit flies To seek a home and kindred in the skies . Oh what are earthly crowns and earthly bliss , And pride 's delusive dreams , compared with this ? Ambition 's laurel , purchased with a flood Of human tears and stained with kindred blood , Once gained , converted to a crown of thorns , Pierces the aching temples it adorns — Not Sappho 's lyre , nor Raphael 's deathless art Can twine the olive round the bleeding heart ; In heaven alone the promised blessing lies , And those who seek — must seek it in the skies ! Seek it through Him who , humbling human pride , Wept o'er man 's fall , and for his ransom died ; Poured out his blood on the accursed tree , To break the chain and set the captive free . Heaven bowed its glory on the cross to teach That greatness man 's lost nature could not reach , The true humility , which stoops to rise , And , leaving earth , claims kindred with the skies . How many pages have been blotted o'er With heartfelt tears , that now are read no more ; And , like the eyes that long have ceased to weep , In dust and darkness quite forgotten sleep ! Dead to the world as if they ne'er had been The favoured actors in one little scene . The scene is changed — and , like their fleeting-fame , The fickle world adores another name . They knew the price at which its praise was bought ; The glittering bauble was not worth a thought ; Yet , Esau like , a better birthright sold , And for base counterfeit exchanged the gold ! Ere man presumptuously his genius boasts , Let him reflect upon the countless hosts , The untold myriads , of each age and clime , That sleep forgotten in the grave of time . What were their names ! Go ask the silent sod Their deeds — their record lives but with their God ! At every step we tread on kindred earth , Nor know the spot that gave our fathers birth . Oh ! could we call before our wondering eyes All that have lived — and bid the dead arise , From the first moment the Creator spoke The word of power , and light through darkness broke , And see earth covered with the mighty tide Of all who on her bosom lived and died , What a stupendous thought would fill the soul Could we behold life 's breathing ocean roll Its human billows onward — and the mass The grave has swallowed , down from Adam , pass In one unbroken stream — the brain would reel — Lost in immensity , would cease to feel ! Whilst living , ah , how few were known to fame ! One in a million has not left a name ,— A single token , on life 's shifting scene , To tell to other years that such has been . Yet man , unaided by a hope sublime , Thinks that his puny arm can cope with time ; That his vast genius can reverse the doom , And shed a deathless light upon his tomb ; That distant ages shall his worth admire , And young hearts kindle at the sacred fire Of him whose fame no envious clouds o'ercast , Yet died forgotten and unknown at last .</p>

    <docTitle><titlePart>Oh think not genius , with its hallowed light , Can break the gloom of an eternal night ; For splendid talents often lead astray The unguarded heart , and hide the narrow way , While the unlearned and those of low estate , With faith 's clear eye behold the living gate , Whose portals open on the shoreless sea Where time 's strong ocean meets eternity . Across the gulf that stretches far beneath Lies the dark valley of the shade of death — A land of deep forgetfulness ,— a shore Which all must traverse , but return no more To this sad earth , to dissipate our dread , And tell the mighty secrets of the dead . Enough for us that those drear realms were trod By heavenly footsteps , that the Son of God Passed the dark bourne and vanquished Death , to save The weary wanderers of life 's stormy wave . Why then should man thus cleave to things of earth ? Daily experience proves their little worth — Or waste those noble qualities of mind , For wise and better purposes designed , In the pursuit of trifles , which confer No solid pleasure on their worshipper ; Or in the search of causes that are known And guided by Omnipotence alone ? A height his finite reason cannot reach , And all his boasted learning fails to teach ? While the bewildering thought overwhelms his brain , Death comes to prove his speculations vain ! Is he deserving of a better doom Who will not raise a hope beyond the tomb ? Who , quite enamoured with his fallen state , Clings to the world and leaves the rest to fate ; Prefers corruption to his Maker 's smile , “ And shuns the light because his deeds are vile ? ” The man who feels the value of his soul , Presses unwearied towards a higher goal ; Leaving this earth , he seeks a brighter prize , And claims a crown immortal in the skies . The child of pleasure may despise his aim , And heap reproach upon the Christian 's name , May laugh his faith , as foolishness , to scorn :— These by the man of God are meekly borne . His glorious hope no infidel can shake ; He suffers calmly for his Saviour 's sake .— The world 's poor votary seeks in vain for peace : He cannot bid the voice of conscience cease Its dire upbraidings ; in his heartless course He meets at every turn the fiend Remorse , Who glares upon him with her tearless eye , That sears his heart — but mocks its agony . He hears that voice , amid the festive throng , Speak in the dance and murmur in the song , A death-bell , pealing in the midnight chime , Whose awful tones proclaim the lapse of time , And e'en the winged moments as they fly Seem to proclaim — “ Rash mortal , thou must die ! Soon must thou tread the path thy fathers trod , And stand before the judgment-seat of God ! ” — He hears — but seeks in pleasure 's cup to drown The dread that weighs his ardent spirit down ; Derides the warning voice in mercy sent ; Rejects the thought of after-punishment ; In folly 's vortex wastes the spring of youth , Nor , till death summons , owns the awful truth ; Feels it too late to calm the agonies Remorse has kindled — and despairing , dies ! But in the breast where true religion reigns There is a balm for all these mental pains ; A sweet contentment , felt , but undefined , A full and free surrender of the mind To its divine-original ; a trust Which lifts to heaven the dweller of the dust . The pilgrim , glowing with a hope divine , Counts not the distance to the heavenly shrine ; He meets with guardian spirits on the road , Who cheer his steps and ease his heavy load . Serenely journeying to a better clime He does not shudder at the lapse of time ; But calmly drinks the cup of mortal woe , And finds that peace the world cannot bestow ; That promised joy which brightens all beneath , And smooths his pillow on the bed of death ; That perfect love which casteth out all fear , And wafts his spirit to a happier sphere !— Fame is a dream — the praise of man as brief As morning dew upon the folded leaf ; The summer sun exhales the pearly tear , And leaves no trace of its existence there . Seek not for immortality below , But fix your hopes beyond this vale of woe , That when oblivion gathers round thy sod , A lasting record may be found with God !— THE DELUGE . Visions of the years gone by Flash upon my mental eye ; Ages time no longer numbers , Forms that share oblivion 's slumbers , Creatures of that elder world Now in dust and darkness hurled , Crushed beneath the heavy rod Of a long forsaken God ! Hark ! what spirit moves the crowd ? Like the voice of waters loud , Through the open city gate , Urged by wonder , fear , or hate , Onward rolls the mighty tide — Spreads the tumult far and wide . Heedless of the noontide glare , Infancy and age are there ,— Joyous youth and matron staid , Blooming bride and blushing maid ,— Manhood with his fiery glance , War-chief with his lifted lance ,— Beauty with her jewelled brow , Hoary age with locks of snow : Prince , and peer , and statesman grave , White-stoled priest , and dark-browed slave ,— Plumed helm , and crowned head , By one mighty impulse led — Mingle in the living mass , That onward to the desert pass ! With song and shout and impious glee , What rush earth 's myriads forth to see ? Hark ! the sultry air is rent With their boisterous merriment ! Are they to the vineyards rushing , Where the grape 's rich blood is gushing ? Or hurrying to the bridal rite Of warrior brave and beauty bright ? Ah no ! those heads in mockery crowned , Those pennons gay with roses bound , Hie not to a scene of gladness — Theirs is mirth that ends in madness ! All recklessly they rush to hear The dark words of that gifted seer , Who amid a guilty race Favour found and saving grace ; Rescued from the doom that hurled To chaos back a sinful world .— Self-polluted , lost , debased , Every noble trait effaced , To rapine , lust , and murder given , Denying God , defying heaven , Spoilers of the shrine and hearth , Behold the impious sons of earth ! Alas ! all fatally opposed , The heart of erring man is closed Against that warning , and he deems The prophet 's counsel idle dreams , And laughs to hear the preacher rave Of bursting cloud and whelming wave ! Tremble Earth ! the awful doom That sweeps thy millions to the tomb Hangs darkly o'er thee ,— and the train That gaily throng the open plain , Shall never raise those laughing eyes To welcome summer 's cloudless skies ; Shall never see the golden beam Of day light up the wood and stream , Or the rich and ripened corn Waving in the breath of morn , Or their rosy children twine Chaplets of the clustering vine :— The bow is bent ! the shaft is sped ! Who shall wail above the dead ? What arrests their frantic course ? Back recoils the startled horse , And the stifling sob of fear Like a knell appals the ear ! Lips are quivering — cheeks are pale — Palsied limbs all trembling fail ; Eyes with bursting terror gaze On the sun 's portentous blaze , Through the wide horizon gleaming , Like a blood-red banner streaming ; While like chariots from afar , Armed for elemental war , Clouds in quick succession rise , Darkness spreads o'er all the skies ; And a lurid twilight gloom Closes o'er earth 's living tomb ! Nature 's pulse has ceased to play ,— Night usurps the crown of day ,— Every quaking heart is still , Conscious of the coming ill . Lo , the fearful pause is past , The awful tempest bursts at last ! Torrents sweeping down amain With a deluge flood the plain ; The rocks are rent , the mountains reel , Earth 's yawning caves their depths reveal ; The forests groan ,— the heavy gale Shrieks out Creation 's funeral wail . Hark ! that loud tremendous roar ! Ocean overleaps the shore , Pouring all his giant waves O'er the fated land of graves ; Where his white-robed spirit glides , Death the advancing billow rides , And the mighty conqueror smiles In triumph o'er the sinking isles . Hollow murmurs fill the air , Thunders roll and lightnings glare ; Shrieks of woe and fearful cries , Mingled sounds of horror rise ; Dire confusion , frantic grief , Agony that mocks relief , Like a tempest heaves the crowd , While in accents fierce and loud , With pallid lips and curdled blood , Each trembling cries , “ The flood ! the flood ! ” THE AVENGER OF BLOOD . There were two sons of Ashur at work in the field , And one to the other his passion revealed — As the white barley bowed to the stroke of his scythe , He burst out in accents exultingly blithe — “ I have wooed a young maid !— I have wooed and I 've won , On a lovelier face never glanced yon bright sun ; To the tall stately cedar my love I 'll compare , With her eyes ’ shaded glory , her long raven hair , And her bosom as white as the snow when it gleams On Lebanon 's heights , ere washed down by the streams . She has ravished and filled my rapt soul with delight ; She 's more dear to my heart than yon heavens to my sight . ” — “ And who is the chosen ? ” his comrade replied , Whilst the deepest of crimson his swarthy cheek dyed , His severed lips trembled , his eagle eye fell With a glance on his kinsman that urged him to tell .— “ ‘ Tis Iddo 's bright daughter ! ” — The words were scarce said — At the feet of his brother young Simeon lay dead .— It was but one blow on those temples so fair , One fierce cry of anger and jealous despair ; And shuddering with horror his stern rival stood , And gazed on those features disfigured with blood .—</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>Weep , fratricide , weep !— ‘ tis in vain that you cast Your arms round that pale form , the struggle is past ; ‘ Tis in vain that chilled heart to your bosom you press , Its stillness increases your frantic distress . You have scattered the gems in youth 's beautiful crown , And his sun at mid-day has in darkness gone down ; He never shall bind for your false love a wreath , The hand of the bridegroom is stiffened in death . Then dash from those wild eyes the fast-flowing tear , And fly !— for the City of Refuge is near .— There 's a murmur of voices , a shout on the wind , Fly ! fly ! the Avenger of Blood is behind !— He fled like an arrow just launched from the bow , O'erwhelm ' d with remorse and distracted with woe ; The victim of passion — he 'd gladly give all Life 's dearest enjoyments that hour to recall . The stain on his hands added wings to his flight , As onward he sped through the shadows of night , And his startled ear caught in the wind 's fitful moan , As it swept through the forest , a faint dying groan ; The leaves rustling near sent a chill to his heart , And oft backward he glanced with an agonized start , And felt on his throat , parched and swollen with dread , The soul-thrilling grasp of the phantom-like dead . That pang was too great for the sinner to bear , And his fears found a voice in wild shrieks of despair ! But the night and its long noon of horrors is past , A broad line of light on the blue hills is cast , And the city of refuge before him appears , Like a beacon of hope , giving rest to his fears — “ But hark !— the avenger of blood is at hand ; Dost thou hear the loud shouts of his death-dooming band ? The trampling of horses rings sharp on the breeze , And armour is glancing at times through the trees ; On ! on ! for thy life !— if they compass the plain , Thy sentence is sealed and all rescue is vain ? ” — He strains every nerve — he redoubles his speed , And strength is supplied in the moment of need , The race is for life — and the city is won , Ere its broad towers reflect the first beams of the sun .— One proud glance of triumph the fugitive threw On the band of pursuers that burst on his view , He shook his clenched hand — and a tremulous cry Rose and died on his pale lips their wrath to defy ; But the effort , too mighty , has severed in twain His heart-strings — he staggers and sinks to the plain , And the cold dews that moisten that toil-crimsoned face Tell that death claims his victim , the prize of the race , That the city no refuge to guilt can afford — He has found an Avenger of Blood in the Lord !</docImprint>

       <l n="69">And the shade of a deathless grief was there ,</l>

       <l n="1">I know a cliff , whose steep and craggy brow</l>

       <l n="3">The advancing billow from its rugged base ;</l>
       <l n="4">Yet many a goodly rood of land lies deep</l>
       <l n="5">Beneath the wild wave buried , which rolls on</l>
       <l n="6">Its course exulting o'er the prostrate towers</l>
       <l n="7">Of high cathedral — church — and abbey fair ,—</l>
       <l n="8">Lifting its loud and everlasting voice</l>
       <l n="9">Over the ruins , which its depths enshroud ,</l>
       <l n="10">As if it called on Time , to render back</l>
       <l n="11">The things that were , and give to life again</l>
       <l n="12">All that in dark oblivion sleeps below :—</l>
       <l n="13">Perched on the summit of that lofty cliff</l>
       <l n="14">A time-worn edifice o'erlooks the wave ,</l>
       <l n="15">“ Which greets the fisher 's home-returning bark , ”</l>
       <l n="16">And the young seaman checks his blithesome song</l>

       <l n="18">Majestic in decay , that roofless pile</l>

       <l n="21">The lonely record of departed years :—</l>
       <l n="22">Yes — those who view that ruin feel an awe</l>
       <l n="23">Sink in the heart , like those who look on death</l>
       <l n="24">For the first time , and hear within the soul</l>
       <l n="25">A voice of warning whisper ,— “ Thus , e'en thus ,</l>
       <l n="26">All human glories perish — rent from time ,</l>

       <l n="38">To mar its beauty ;— there sublime it stands ,</l>
       <l n="39">Waving its graceful branches o'er the soil</l>

       <l n="44">That glowed like molten gold — a saffron sea</l>
       <l n="45">Fretted with crimson billows , whose rich tints</l>

       <l n="59">And hair enwreathed with sprigs of ash and yew</l>
       <l n="60">Bespoke a mind in ruins . On her brow</l>
       <l n="61">Despair had stamped his iron seal ; her cheek</l>
       <l n="62">Was pale as moonlight on the misty wave ;</l>
       <l n="63">Her hollow eyes were fixed on vacancy ,</l>
       <l n="64">Or wildly sent their hurried glances round</l>
       <l n="65">With quick impatient gesture , as in quest</l>
       <l n="66">Of some loved object , present to her mind ,</l>

       <l n="71">In a low plaintive strain of melody ,</l>
       <l n="72">That rose and died away upon the breeze ,</l>
       <l n="73">The mournful requiem of her perished hopes :—</l>

       <l n="78">The dark green leaves take a sadder shade ,</l>
       <l n="79">And the flowers turn pale and begin to fade ;</l>
       <l n="80">The landscape grows dim in the deepening gloom ,</l>
       <l n="81">And the dead awake in the silent tomb .</l>
       <l n="82">I have watched the return of my true-love 's bark ,</l>

       <l n="85">But his ship on the deep is far away ;</l>
       <l n="86">I have gazed for hours on the whitening track</l>
       <l n="87">Of the pathless waters , and called him back ,</l>
       <l n="88">But my voice returned on the moaning blast ,</l>

       <l n="90">We parted on just such a lovely night :</l>

       <l n="93">And the stars above us their vigils kept ,</l>

       <l n="122">When the song ceased , she turned her heavy eyes</l>
       <l n="123">With such a piteous glance upon my face ;</l>
       <l n="124">It pierced my heart , and fast the gathering tears</l>
       <l n="125">Blinded my sight . Alas ! poor maniac ;</l>

       <l n="57">Bathing now in floods of light ,</l>
       <l n="58">Now retreating from the sight ,</l>
       <l n="59">As the heavy vapoury cloud</l>
       <l n="60">Flings athwart its sable shroud ;</l>
       <l n="61">Onward as her course is steering ,</l>
       <l n="62">Now through broken cliffs appearing ,</l>
       <l n="63">She shows the brightness of her form</l>
       <l n="64">And laughs exulting at the storm ;</l>
       <l n="65">Whilst misty hills and moon-lit plains</l>
       <l n="66">Echo far , Jehovah reigns !</l>
