     <lg type="stanza" n="1">
      <l n="1">Hamelin Town 's in Brunswick ,</l>
      <l n="2">By famous Hanover city ;</l>
      <l n="3">The river Weser , deep and wide ,</l>
      <l n="4">Washes its wall on the southern side ;</l>
      <l n="5">A pleasanter spot you never spied ;</l>
      <l n="6">But , when begins my ditty ,</l>
      <l n="7">Almost five hundred years ago ,</l>
      <l n="8">To see the townsfolk suffer so</l>
      <l n="9">From vermin , was a pity .</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
    <lg type="part" n="2">
     <head>II .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="10">Rats !</l>
      <l n="11">They fought the dogs and killed the cats ,</l>
      <l n="12">And bit the babies in the cradles ,</l>
      <l n="13">And ate the cheeses out of the vats ,</l>
      <l n="14">And licked the soup from the cooks ’ own ladles ,</l>
      <l n="15">Split open the kegs of salted sprats ,</l>
      <l n="16">Made nests inside men 's Sunday hats ,</l>
      <l n="17">And even spoiled the women 's chats</l>
      <l n="18">By drowning their speaking</l>
      <l n="19">With shrieking and squeaking</l>
      <l n="20">In fifty different sharps and flats .</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
    <lg type="part" n="3">
     <head>III .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="21">At last the people in a body</l>
      <l n="22">To the Town Hall came flocking :</l>
      <l n="23">“ ‘ Tis clear , ” cried they , “ our Mayor 's a noddy ;</l>
      <l n="24">And as for our Corporation — shocking</l>
      <l n="25">To think we buy gowns lined with ermine</l>
      <l n="26">For dolts that can n't or wo n't determine</l>
      <l n="27">What 's best to rid us of our vermin !</l>
      <l n="28">You hope , because you 're old and obese ,</l>
      <l n="29">To find in the furry civic robe ease ?</l>
      <l n="30">Rouse up , sirs ! Give your brains a racking</l>
      <l n="31">To find the remedy we 're lacking ,</l>
      <l n="32">Or , sure as fate , we 'll send you packing ! ”</l>
      <l n="33">At this the Mayor and Corporation</l>
      <l n="34">Quaked with a mighty consternation .</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
    <lg type="part" n="4">
     <head>IV .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="35">An hour they sat in council ;</l>
      <l n="36">At length the Mayor broke silence :</l>
      <l n="37">“ For a guilder I 'd my ermine gown sell ,</l>
      <l n="38">I wish I were a mile hence !</l>
      <l n="39">It 's easy to bid one rack one 's brain —</l>
      <l n="40">I 'm sure my poor head aches again ,</l>
      <l n="41">I 've scratched it so , and all in vain .</l>
      <l n="42">Oh , for a trap , a trap , a trap ! ”</l>
      <l n="43">Just as he said this , what should hap</l>
      <l n="44">At the chamber-door but a gentle tap ?</l>
      <l n="45">“ Bless us , ” cried the Mayor , “ what 's that ? ”</l>
      <l n="46">( With the Corporation as he sat ,</l>
      <l n="47">Looking little though wondrous fat ;</l>
      <l n="48">Nor brighter was his eye , nor moister</l>
      <l n="49">Than a too-long-opened oyster ,</l>
      <l n="50">Save when at noon his paunch grew mutinous</l>
      <l n="51">For a plate of turtle green and glutinous )</l>
      <l n="52">“ Only a scraping of shoes on the mat ?</l>
      <l n="53">Anything like the sound of a rat</l>
      <l n="54">Makes my heart go pit-a-pat ! ”</l>

    <lg type="part" n="5">
     <head>V .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="55">“ Come in ! ” — the Mayor cried , looking bigger :</l>
      <l n="56">And in did come the strangest figure !</l>
      <l n="57">His queer long coat from heel to head</l>
      <l n="58">Was half of yellow and half of red ,</l>
      <l n="59">And he himself was tall and thin ,</l>
      <l n="60">With sharp blue eyes , each like a pin ,</l>
      <l n="61">And light loose hair , yet swarthy skin ,</l>
      <l n="62">No tuft on cheek nor beard on chin ,</l>
      <l n="63">But lips where smiles went out and in ;</l>
      <l n="64">There was no guessing his kith and kin :</l>
      <l n="65">And nobody could enough admire</l>
      <l n="66">The tall man and his quaint attire .</l>
      <l n="67">Quoth one : “ It 's as my great-grandsire ,</l>
      <l n="68">Starting up at the Trump of Doom 's tone ,</l>
      <l n="69">Had walked this way from his painted tombstone ! ”</l>
     </lg>

    <lg type="part" n="6">
     <head>VI .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="6">
      <l n="70">He advanced to the council-table :</l>
      <l n="71">And , “ Please your honours , ” said he , “ I 'm able ,</l>
      <l n="72">By means of a secret charm , to draw</l>
      <l n="73">All creatures living beneath the sun ,</l>
      <l n="74">That creep or swim or fly or run ,</l>
      <l n="75">After me so as you never saw !</l>
      <l n="76">And I chiefly use my charm</l>
      <l n="77">On creatures that do people harm ,</l>
      <l n="78">The mole and toad and newt and viper ;</l>
      <l n="79">And people call me the Pied Piper . ”</l>
      <l n="80">( And here they noticed round his neck</l>
      <l n="81">A scarf of red and yellow stripe ,</l>
      <l n="82">To match with his coat of the self-same cheque ;</l>
      <l n="83">And at the scarf 's end hung a pipe ;</l>
      <l n="84">And his fingers , they noticed , were ever straying</l>
      <l n="85">As if impatient to be playing</l>
      <l n="86">Upon this pipe , as low it dangled</l>
      <l n="87">Over his vesture so old-fangled . )</l>
      <l n="88">“ Yet , ” said he , “ poor piper as I am ,</l>
      <l n="89">In Tartary I freed the Cham ,</l>
      <l n="90">Last June , from his huge swarms of gnats ;</l>
      <l n="91">I eased in Asia the Nizam</l>
      <l n="92">Of a monstrous brood of vampire-bats :</l>
      <l n="93">And as for what your brain bewilders ,</l>
      <l n="94">If I can rid your town of rats</l>
      <l n="95">Will you give me a thousand guilders ? ”</l>
      <l n="96">“ One ? fifty thousand ! ” — was the exclamation</l>
      <l n="97">Of the astonished Mayor and Corporation .</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
    <lg type="part" n="7">
     <head>VII .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="7">
      <l n="98">Into the street the Piper stept ,</l>
      <l n="99">Smiling first a little smile ,</l>
      <l n="100">As if he knew what magic slept</l>
      <l n="101">In his quiet pipe the while ;</l>
      <l n="102">Then , like a musical adept ,</l>
      <l n="103">To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled ,</l>
      <l n="104">And green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled ,</l>
      <l n="105">Like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled ;</l>
      <l n="106">And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered ,</l>
      <l n="107">You heard as if an army muttered ;</l>
      <l n="108">And the muttering grew to a grumbling ;</l>
      <l n="109">And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling ;</l>
      <l n="110">And out of the houses the rats came tumbling .</l>
      <l n="111">Great rats , small rats , lean rats , brawny rats</l>
      <l n="112">Brown rats , black rats , gray rats , tawny rats</l>
      <l n="113">Grave old plodders , gay young friskers ,</l>
      <l n="114">Fathers , mothers , uncles , cousins ,</l>
      <l n="115">Cocking tails and pricking whiskers ,</l>
      <l n="116">Families by tens and dozens ,</l>
      <l n="117">Brothers , sisters , husbands , wives —</l>
      <l n="118">Followed the Piper for their lives .</l>
      <l n="119">From street to street he piped advancing ,</l>
      <l n="120">And step for step they followed dancing ,</l>
      <l n="121">Until they came to the river Weser ,</l>
      <l n="122">Wherein all plunged and perished !</l>
      <l n="123">— Save one who , stout as Julius Caesar ,</l>
      <l n="124">Swam across and lived to carry</l>
      <l n="125">( As he , the manuscript he cherished )</l>
      <l n="126">To Rat-land home his commentary :</l>
      <l n="127">Which was , “ At the first shrill notes of the pipe ,</l>
      <l n="128">I heard a sound as of scraping tripe ,</l>
      <l n="129">And putting apples , wondrous ripe ,</l>
      <l n="130">Into a cider-press 's gripe :</l>
      <l n="131">And a moving away of pickle-tub-boards ,</l>
      <l n="132">And a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards ,</l>
      <l n="133">And a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks ,</l>
      <l n="134">And a breaking the hoops of butter-casks :</l>
      <l n="135">And it seemed as if a voice</l>
      <l n="136">( Sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery</l>
      <l n="137">Is breathed ) called out , ‘ Oh , rats , rejoice !</l>
      <l n="138">The world is grown to one vast drysaltery !</l>
      <l n="139">So munch on , crunch on , take your nuncheon ,</l>
      <l n="140">Breakfast , supper , dinner , luncheon ! ’</l>
      <l n="141">And just as a bulky sugar-puncheon ,</l>
      <l n="142">All ready staved , like a great sun shone</l>
      <l n="143">Glorious scarce an inch before me ,</l>
      <l n="144">Just as methought it said , ‘ Come , bore me ! ’</l>
      <l n="145">— I found the Weser rolling o'er me . ”</l>

      <l n="146">You should have heard the Hamelin people</l>
      <l n="147">Ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple .</l>
      <l n="148">“ Go , ” cried the Mayor , “ and get long poles ,</l>
      <l n="149">Poke out the nests and block up the holes !</l>
      <l n="150">Consult with carpenters and builders ,</l>
      <l n="151">And leave in our town not even a trace</l>

      <l n="157">For council dinners made rare havoc</l>
      <l n="158">With Claret , Moselle , Vin-de-Grave , Hock ;</l>

      <l n="160">Their cellar 's biggest butt with Rhenish .</l>
      <l n="161">To pay this sum to a wandering fellow</l>
      <l n="162">With a gypsy coat of red and yellow !</l>
      <l n="163">“ Beside , ” quoth the Mayor with a knowing wink ,</l>
      <l n="164">“ Our business was done at the river 's brink ;</l>
