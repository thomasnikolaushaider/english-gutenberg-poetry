    <docTitle><titlePart>One hesitates to lift the veil and throw the light upon a life so hidden and a personality so withdrawn as that of Emma Lazarus ; but while her memory is fresh , and the echo of her songs still lingers in these pages , we feel it a duty to call up her presence once more , and to note the traits that made it remarkable and worthy to shine out clearly before the world . Of dramatic episode or climax in her life there is none ; outwardly all was placid and serene , like an untroubled stream whose depths alone hold the strong , quick tide . The story of her life is the story of a mind , of a spirit , ever seeking , ever striving , and pressing onward and upward to new truth and light . Her works are the mirror of this progress . In reviewing them , the first point that strikes us is the precocity , or rather the spontaneity , of her poetic gift . She was a born singer ; poetry was her natural language , and to write was less effort than to speak , for she was a shy , sensitive child , with strange reserves and reticences , not easily putting herself “ en rapport ” with those around her . Books were her world from her earliest years ; in them she literally lost and found herself . She was eleven years old when the War of Succession broke out , which inspired her first lyric outbursts . Her poems and translations written between the ages of fourteen and seventeen were collected , and constituted her first published volume . Crude and immature as these productions naturally were , and utterly condemned by the writer 's later judgment , they are , nevertheless , highly interesting and characteristic , giving , as they do , the keynote of much that afterwards unfolded itself in her life . One cannot fail to be rather painfully impressed by the profound melancholy pervading the book . The opening poem is “ In Memoriam , ” — on the death of a school friend and companion ; and the two following poems also have death for theme . “ On a Lock of my Mother 's Hair ” gives us reflections on growing old . These are the four poems written at the age of fourteen . There is not a wholly glad and joyous strain in the volume , and we might smile at the recurrence of broken vows , broken hearts , and broken lives in the experience of this maiden just entered upon her teens , were it not that the innocent child herself is in such deadly earnest . The two long narrative poems , “ Bertha ” and “ Elfrida , ” are tragic in the extreme . Both are dashed off apparently at white heat : “ Elfrida , ” over fifteen hundred lines of blank verse , in two weeks ; “ Bertha , ” in three and a half . We have said that Emma Lazarus was a born singer , but she did not sing , like a bird , for joy of being alive ; and of being young , alas ! there is no hint in these youthful effusions , except inasmuch as this unrelieved gloom , this ignorance of “ values , ” so to speak , is a sign of youth , common especially among gifted persons of acute and premature sensibilities , whose imagination , not yet focused by reality , overreached the mark . With Emma Lazarus , however , this sombre streak has a deeper root ; something of birth and temperament is in it — the stamp and heritage of a race born to suffer . But dominant and fundamental though it was , Hebraism was only latent thus far . It was classic and romantic art that first attracted and inspired her . She pictures Aphrodite the beautiful , arising from the waves , and the beautiful Apollo and his loves ,— Daphne , pursued by the god , changing into the laurel , and the enamored Clytie into the faithful sunflower . Beauty , for its own sake , supreme and unconditional , charmed her primarily and to the end . Her restless spirit found repose in the pagan idea ,— the absolute unity and identity of man with nature , as symbolized in the Greek myths , where every natural force becomes a person , and where , in turn , persons pass with equal readiness and freedom back into nature again .</titlePart></docTitle>

  <body>
   <p>In this connection a name would suggest itself even if it did not appear ,— Heine , the Greek , Heine the Jew , Heine the Romanticist , as Emma Lazarus herself has styled him ; and already in this early volume of hers we have trace of the kinship and affinity that afterwards so plainly declared itself . Foremost among the translations are a number of his songs , rendered with a finesse and a literalness that are rarely combined . Four years later , at the age of twenty-one , she published her second volume , “ Admetus and Other Poems , ” which at once took rank as literature both in America and England , and challenged comparison with the work of established writers . Of classic themes we have “ Admetus ” and “ Orpheus , ” and of romantic the legend of Tannhauser and of the saintly Lohengrin . All are treated with an artistic finish that shows perfect mastery of her craft , without detracting from the freshness and flow of her inspiration . While sounding no absolutely new note in the world , she yet makes us aware of a talent of unusual distinction , and a highly endowed nature ,— a sort of tact of sentiment and expression , an instinct of the true and beautiful , and that quick intuition which is like second-sight in its sensitiveness to apprehend and respond to external stimulus . But it is not the purely imaginative poems in this volume that most deeply interest us . We come upon experience of life in these pages ; not in the ordinary sense , however , of outward activity and movement , but in the hidden undercurrent of being . “ The epochs of our life are not in the visible facts , but in the silent thoughts by the wayside as we walk . ” This is the motto , drawn from Emerson , which she chooses for her poem of “ Epochs , ” which marks a pivotal moment in her life . Difficult to analyze , difficult above all to convey , if we would not encroach upon the domain of private and personal experience , is the drift of this poem , or rather cycle of poems , that ring throughout with a deeper accent and a more direct appeal than has yet made itself felt . It is the drama of the human soul ,— “ the mystic winged and flickering butterfly , ” “ flitting between earth and sky , ” in its passage from birth to death .</p>
   <p>A golden morning of June ! “ Sweet empty sky without a stain . ” Sunlight and mist and “ ripple of rain-fed rills . ” “ A murmur and a singing manifold . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ What simple things be these the soul to raise</l>
     <l n="2">To bounding joy , and make young pulses beat</l>
     <l n="3">With nameless pleasure , finding life so sweet ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Such is youth , a June day , fair and fresh and tender with dreams and longing and vague desire . The morn lingers and passes , but the noon has not reached its height before the clouds begin to rise , the sunshine dies , the air grows thick and heavy , the lightnings flash , the thunder breaks among the hills , rolls and gathers and grows , until</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Behold , yon bolt struck home ,</l>
     <l n="2">And over ruined fields the storm hath come . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Now we have the phases of the soul ,— the shock and surprise of grief in the face of the world made desolate . Loneliness and despair for a space , and then , like stars in the night , the new births of the spirit , the wonderful outcoming from sorrow : the mild light of patience at first ; hope and faith kindled afresh in the very jaws of evil ; the new meaning and worth of life beyond sorrow , beyond joy ; and finally duty , the holiest word of all , that leads at last to victory and peace . The poem rounds and completes itself with the close of “ the long , rich day , ” and the release of</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The mystic winged and flickering butterfly ,</l>
     <l n="2">A human soul , that drifts at liberty ,</l>
     <l n="3">Ah ! who can tell to what strange paradise ,</l>
     <l n="4">To what undreamed-of fields and lofty skies ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>We have dwelt at some length upon this poem , which seems to us , in a certain sense , subjective and biographical ; but upon closer analysis there is still another conclusion to arrive at . In “ Epochs ” we have , doubtless , the impress of a calamity brought very near to the writer , and profoundly working upon her sensibilities ; not however by direct , but reflex action , as it were , and through sympathetic emotion — the emotion of the deeply-stirred spectator , of the artist , the poet who lives in the lives of others , and makes their joys and their sorrows his own .</p>
   <p>Before dismissing this volume we may point out another clue as to the shaping of mind and character . The poem of “ Admetus ” is dedicated “ to my friend Ralph Waldo Emerson . ” Emma Lazarus was between seventeen and eighteen years of age when the writings of Emerson fell into her hands , and it would be difficult to over-estimate the impression produced upon her . As she afterwards wrote : “ To how many thousand youthful hearts has not his word been the beacon — nay , more , the guiding star — that led them safely through periods of mental storm and struggle ! ” Of no one is this more true than herself . Left , to a certain extent , without compass or guide , without any positive or effective religious training , this was the first great moral revelation of her life . We can easily realize the chaos and ferment of an over-stimulated brain , steeped in romantic literature , and given over to the wayward leadings of the imagination . Who can tell what is true , what is false , in a world where fantasy is as real as fact ? Emerson 's word fell like truth itself , “ a shaft of light shot from the zenith , ” a golden rule of thought and action . His books were bread and wine to her , and she absorbed them into her very being . She felt herself invincibly drawn to the master , “ that fount of wisdom and goodness , ” and it was her great privilege during these years to be brought into personal relations with him . From the first he showed her a marked interest and sympathy , which became for her one of the most valued possessions of her life . He criticised her work with the fine appreciation and discrimination that made him quick to discern the quality of her talent as well as of her personality , and he was no doubt attracted by her almost transparent sincerity and singleness of soul , as well as by the simplicity and modesty that would have been unusual even in a person not gifted . He constituted himself , in a way , her literary mentor , advised her as to the books she should read and the attitude of mind she should cultivate . For some years he corresponded with her very faithfully ; his letters are full of noble and characteristic utterances , and give evidence of a warm regard that in itself was a stimulus and a high incentive . But encouragement even from so illustrious a source failed to elate the young poetess , or even to give her a due sense of the importance and value of her work , or the dignity of her vocation . We have already alluded to her modesty in her unwillingness to assert herself or claim any prerogative ,— something even morbid and exaggerated , which we know not how to define , whether as over - sensitiveness or indifference . Once finished , the heat and glow of composition spent , her writings apparently ceased to interest her . She often resented any allusion to them on the part of intimate friends , and the public verdict as to their excellence could not reassure or satisfy her . The explanation is not far , perhaps , to seek . Was it not the “ Ewig-Weibliche ” that allows no prestige but its own ? Emma Lazarus was a true woman , too distinctly feminine to wish to be exceptional , or to stand alone and apart , even by virtue of superiority .</p>
   <p>A word now as to her life and surroundings . She was one of a family of seven , and her parents were both living . Her winters were passed in New York , and her summers by the sea . In both places her life was essentially quiet and retired . The success of her book had been mainly in the world of letters . In no wise tricked out to catch the public eye , her writings had not yet made her a conspicuous figure , but were destined slowly to take their proper place and give her the rank that she afterwards held .</p>
   <p>For some years now almost everything that she wrote was published in “ Lippincott 's Magazine , ” then edited by John Foster Kirk , and we shall still find in her poems the method and movement of her life . Nature is still the fount and mirror , reflecting , and again reflected , in the soul . We have picture after picture , almost to satiety , until we grow conscious of a lack of substance and body and of vital play to the thought , as though the brain were spending itself in dreamings and reverie , the heart feeding upon itself , and the life choked by its own fullness without due outlet . Happily , however , the heavy cloud of sadness has lifted , and we feel the subsidence of waves after a storm . She sings “ Matins : ” —</p>

   <p>“ Phantasies ” ( after Robert Schumann ) is the most complete and perfect poem of this period . Like “ Epochs , ” it is a cycle of poems , and the verse has caught the very trick of music ,— alluring , baffling , and evasive . This time we have the landscape of the night , the glamour of moon and stars ,— pictures half real and half unreal , mystic imaginings , fancies , dreams , and the enchantment of “ faerie , ” and throughout the unanswered cry , the eternal “ Wherefore ” of destiny . Dawn ends the song with a fine clear note , the return of day , night 's misty phantoms rolled away , and the world itself , again green , sparkling and breathing freshness .</p>
   <p>In 1874 she published “ Alide , ” a romance in prose drawn from Goethe 's autobiography . It may be of interest to quote the letter she received from Tourgeneff on this occasion :—</p>
   <p>“ Although , generally speaking , I do not think it advisable to take celebrated men , especially poets and artists , as a subject for a novel , still I am truly glad to say that I have read your book with the liveliest interest . It is very sincere and very poetical at the same time ; the life and spirit of Germany have no secrets for you , and your characters are drawn with a pencil as delicate as it is strong . I feel very proud of the approbation you give to my works , and of the influence you kindly attribute to them on your own talent ; an author who write as you do is not a pupil in art any more ; he is not far from being himself a master . ”</p>
   <p>Charming and graceful words , of which the young writer was justly proud .</p>
   <p>About this time occurred the death of her mother , the first break in the home and family circle . In August of 1876 she made a visit to Concord , at the Emersons ’ , memorable enough for her to keep a journal and note down every incident and detail . Very touching to read now , in its almost childlike simplicity , is this record of “ persons that pass and shadows that remain . ” Mr. Emerson himself meets her at the station , and drives with her in his little one-horse wagon to his home , the gray square house , with dark green blinds , set amidst noble trees . A glimpse of the family ,— “ the stately , white-haired Mrs. Emerson , and the beautiful , faithful Ellen , whose figure seems always to stand by the side of her august father . ” Then the picture of Concord itself , lovely and smiling , with its quiet meadows , quiet slopes , and quietest of rivers . She meets the little set of Concord people : Mr. Alcott , for whom she does not share Mr. Emerson 's enthusiasm ; and William Ellery Channing , whose figure stands out like a gnarled and twisted scrub-oak ,— a pathetic , impossible creature , whose cranks and oddities were submitted to on account of an innate nobility of character . “ Generally crabbed and reticent with strangers , he took a liking to me , ” says Emma Lazarus . “ The bond of our sympathy was my admiration for Thoreau , whose memory he actually worships , having been his constant companion in his best days , and his daily attendant in the last years of illness and heroic suffering . I do not know whether I was most touched by the thought of the unique , lofty character that had inspired this depth and fervor of friendship , or by the pathetic constancy and pure affection of the poor , desolate old man before me , who tried to conceal his tenderness and sense of irremediable loss by a show of gruffness and philosophy . He never speaks of Thoreau 's death , ” she says , “ but always ‘ Thoreau 's loss , ’ or ‘ when I lost Mr. Thoreau , ’ or ‘ when Mr. Thoreau went away from Concord ; ’ nor would he confess that he missed him , for there was not a day , an hour , a moment , when he did not feel that his friend was still with him and had never left him . And yet a day or two after , ” she goes on to say , “ when I sat with him in the sunlit wood , looking at the gorgeous blue and silver summer sky , he turned to me and said : ‘ Just half of the world died for me when I lost Mr. Thoreau . None of it looks the same as when I looked at it with him . ’ ... He took me through the woods and pointed out to me every spot visited and described by his friend . Where the hut stood is a little pile of stones , and a sign , ‘ Site of Thoreau 's Hut , ’ and a few steps beyond is the pond with thickly-wooded shore ,— everything exquisitely peaceful and beautiful in the afternoon light , and not a sound to be heard except the crickets or the ‘ z-ing ’ of the locusts which Thoreau has described . Farther on he pointed out to me , in the distant landscape , a low roof , the only one visible , which was the roof of Thoreau 's birthplace . He had been over there many times , he said , since he lost Mr. Thoreau , but had never gone in ,— he was afraid it might look lonely ! But he had often sat on a rock in front of the house and looked at it . ” On parting from his young friend , Mr. Channing gave her a package , which proved to be a copy of his own book on Thoreau , and the pocket compass which Thoreau carried to the Maine woods and on all his excursions . Before leaving the Emersons she received the proof-sheets of her drama of “ The Spagnoletto , ” which was being printed for private circulation . She showed them to Mr. Emerson , who had expressed a wish to see them , and , after reading them , he gave them back to her with the comment that they were “ good . ” She playfully asked him if he would not give her a bigger word to take home to the family . He laughed , and said he did not know of any ; but he went on to tell her that he had taken it up , not expecting to read it through , and had not been able to put it down . Every word and line told of richness in the poetry , he said , and as far as he could judge the play had great dramatic opportunities . Early in the autumn “ The Spagnoletto ” appeared ,— a tragedy in five acts , the scene laid in Italy , 1655 .</p>
   <p>Without a doubt , every one in these days will take up with misgiving , and like Mr. Emerson “ not expecting to read it through , ” a five-act tragedy of the seventeenth century , so far removed apparently from the age and present actualities ,— so opposed to the “ Modernite , ” which has come to be the last word of art . Moreover , great names at once appear ; great shades arise to rebuke the presumptuous new-comer in this highest realm of expression . “ The Spagnoletto ” has grave defects that would probably preclude its ever being represented on the stage . The denoument especially is unfortunate , and sins against our moral and aesthetic instinct . The wretched , tiger-like father stabs himself in the presence of his crushed and erring daughter , so that she may forever be haunted by the horror and the retribution of his death . We are left suspended , as it were , over an abyss , our moral judgment thwarted , our humanity outraged . But “ The Spagnoletto ” is , nevertheless , a remarkable production , and pitched in another key from anything the writer has yet given us . Heretofore we have only had quiet , reflective , passive emotion : now we have a storm and sweep of passion for which we were quite unprepared . Ribera 's character is charged like a thunder-cloud with dramatic elements . Maria Rosa is the child of her father , fired at a flash , “ deaf , dumb , and blind ” at the touch of passion .</p>
   <p>“ Does love steal gently o'er our soul ? ”</p>
   <p>she asks ;</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ What if he come ,</l>
     <l n="2">A cloud , a fire , a whirlwind ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">and then the cry :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">“ O my God !</l>
     <l n="5">This awful joy in mine own heart is love . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="6">Again :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="7">“ While you are here the one thing real to me</l>
     <l n="8">In all the universe is love . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Exquisitely tender and refined are the love scenes — at the ball and in the garden — between the dashing prince-lover in search of his pleasure and the devoted girl with her heart in her eyes , on her lips , in her hand . Behind them , always like a tragic fate , the somber figure of the Spagnoletto , and over all the glow and color and soul of Italy .</p>
   <p>In 1881 appeared the translation of Heine 's poems and ballads , which was generally accepted as the best version of that untranslatable poet . Very curious is the link between that bitter , mocking , cynic spirit and the refined , gentle spirit of Emma Lazarus . Charmed by the magic of his verse , the iridescent play of his fancy , and the sudden cry of the heart piercing through it all , she is as yet unaware or only vaguely conscious of the of the real bond between them : the sympathy in the blood , the deep , tragic , Judaic passion of eighteen hundred years that was smouldering in her own heart , soon to break out and change the whole current of thought and feeling .</p>
   <p>Already , in 1879 , the storm was gathering . In a distant province of Russia at first , then on the banks of the Volga , and finally in Moscow itself , the old cry was raised , the hideous mediaeval charge revived , and the standard of persecution unfurled against the Jews . Province after province took it up . In Bulgaria , Servia , and , above all , Roumania , where , we were told , the sword of the Czar had been drawn to protect the oppressed , Christian atrocities took the place of Moslem atrocities , and history turned a page backward into the dark annals of violence and crime . And not alone in despotic Russia , but in Germany , the seat of modern philosophic thought and culture , the rage of Anti-Semitism broke out and spread with fatal ease and potency . In Berlin itself tumults and riots were threatened . We in America could scarcely comprehend the situation or credit the reports , and for a while we shut our eyes and ears to the facts ; but we were soon rudely awakened from our insensibility , and forced to face the truth . It was in England that the voice was first raised in behalf of justice and humanity . In January , 1881 , there appeared in the “ London Times ” a series of articles , carefully compiled on the testimony of eye-witnesses , and confirmed by official documents , records , etc ., giving an account of events that had been taking place in southern and western Russia during a period of nine months , between April and December of 1880 . We do not need to recall the sickening details . The headings will suffice : outrage , murder , arson , and pillage , and the result ,— 100 , 000 Jewish families made homeless and destitute , and nearly $ 100 , 000 , 000 worth of property destroyed . Nor need we recall the generous outburst of sympathy and indignation from America . “ It is not that it is the oppression of Jews by Russia , ” said Mr. Evarts in the meeting at Chickering Hall Wednesday evening , February 4 ; “ it is that it is the oppression of men and women , and we are men and women . ” So spoke civilized Christendom , and for Judaism ,— who can describe that thrill of brotherhood , quickened anew , the immortal pledge of the race , made one again through sorrow ? For Emma Lazarus it was a trumpet call that awoke slumbering and unguessed echoes . All this time she had been seeking heroic ideals in alien stock , soulless and far removed ; in pagan mythology and mystic , mediaeval Christianity , ignoring her very birthright ,— the majestic vista of the past , down which , “ high above flood and fire , ” had been conveyed the precious scroll of the Moral Law . Hitherto Judaism had been a dead letter to her . Of Portuguese descent , her family had always been members of the oldest and most orthodox congregation of New York , where strict adherence to custom and ceremonial was the watchword of faith ; but it was only during her childhood and earliest years that she attended the synagogue , and conformed to the prescribed rites and usages which she had now long since abandoned as obsolete and having no bearing on modern life . Nor had she any great enthusiasm for her own people . As late as April , 1882 , she published in “ The Century Magazine ” an article written probably some months before , entitled “ Was the Earl of Beaconsfield a Representative Jew ? ” in which she is disposed to accept as the type of the modern Jew the brilliant , successful , but not over-scrupulous chevalier d'industrie . In view of subsequent , or rather contemporaneous events , the closing paragraph of the article in question is worthy of being cited :—</p>
   <p>“ Thus far their religion [ the Jewish ] , whose mere preservation under such adverse conditions seems little short of a miracle , has been deprived of the natural means of development and progress , and has remained a stationary force . The next hundred years will , in our opinion be the test of their vitality as a people ; the phase of toleration upon which they are only now entering will prove whether or not they are capable of growth . ”</p>
   <p>By a curious , almost fateful juxtaposition , in the same number of the magazine appeared Madame Ragozin 's defense of Russian barbarity , and in the following ( May ) number Emma Lazarus 's impassioned appeal and reply , “ Russian Christianity versus Modern Judaism . ” From this time dated the crusade that she undertook in behalf of her race , and the consequent expansion of all her faculties , the growth of spiritual power which always ensues when a great cause is espoused and a strong conviction enters the soul . Her verse rang out as it had never rung before ,— a clarion note , calling a people to heroic action and unity , to the consciousness and fulfillment of a grand destiny . When has Judaism been so stirred as by “ The Crowing of the Red Cock ” and</p>

   <p>Her whole being renewed and refreshed itself at its very source . She threw herself into the study of her race , its language , literature , and history .</p>
   <p>Breaking the outward crust , she pierced to the heart of the faith and “ the miracle ” of its survival . What was it other than the ever-present , ever-vivifying spirit itself , which cannot die ,— the religious and ethical zeal which fires the whole history of the people , and of which she herself felt the living glow within her own soul ? She had come upon the secret and the genius of Judaism ,— that absolute interpenetration and transfusion of spirit with body and substance which , taken literally , often reduces itself to a question of food and drink , a dietary regulation , and again , in proper splendor , incarnates itself and shines out before humanity in the prophets , teachers , and saviors of mankind .</p>
   <p>Those were busy , fruitful years for Emma Lazarus , who worked , not with the pen alone , but in the field of practical and beneficent activity . For there was an immense task to accomplish . The tide of immigration had set in , and ship after ship came laden with hunted human beings flying from their fellow-men , while all the time , like a tocsin , rang the terrible story of cruelty and persecution ,— horrors that the pen refuses to dwell upon . By the hundreds and thousands they flocked upon our shores ,— helpless , innocent victims of injustice and oppression , panic-stricken in the midst of strange and utterly new surroundings .</p>
   <p>Emma Lazarus came into personal contact with these people , and visited them in their refuge on Ward Island . While under the influence of all the emotions aroused by this great crisis in the history of her race , she wrote the “ Dance of Death , ” a drama of persecution of the twelfth century , founded upon the authentic records ,— unquestionably her finest work in grasp and scope , and , above all , in moral elevation and purport . The scene is laid in Nordhausen , a free city in Thuringia , where the Jews , living , as the deemed , in absolute security and peace , were caught up in the wave of persecution that swept over Europe at that time . Accused of poisoning the wells and causing the pestilence , or black death , as it was called , they were condemned to be burned .</p>
   <p>We do not here intend to enter upon a critical or literary analysis of the play , or to point out dramatic merits or defects , but we should like to make its readers feel with us the holy ardor and impulse of the writer and the spiritual import of the work . The action is without surprise , the doom fixed from the first ; but so glowing is the canvas with local and historic color , so vital and intense the movement , so resistless , the “ internal evidence , ” if we may call it thus , penetrating its very substance and form , that we are swept along as by a wave of human sympathy and grief . In contrast with “ The Spagnoletto , ” how large is the theme and how all-embracing the catastrophe ! In place of the personal we have the drama of the universal . Love is only a flash now ,— a dream caught sight of and at once renounced at a higher claim .</p>

   <p>The “ Dance to Death ” was published , along with other poems and translations from the Hebrew poets of mediaeval Spain , in a small column entitled “ Songs of a Semite . ” The tragedy was dedicated , “ In profound veneration and respect to the memory of George Eliot , the illustrious writer who did most among the artists of our day towards elevating and ennobling the spirit of Jewish nationality . ”</p>
   <p>For this was the idea that had caught the imagination of Emma Lazarus , — a restored and independent nationality and repatriation in Palestine . In her article in “ The Century ” of February , 1883 , on the “ Jewish Problem , ” she says :—</p>
   <p>“ I am fully persuaded that all suggested solutions other than this are but temporary palliatives .... The idea formulated by George Eliot has already sunk into the minds of many Jewish enthusiasts , and it germinates with miraculous rapidity . ‘ The idea that I am possessed with , ’ says Deronda , ‘ is that of restoring a political existence to my people ; making them a nation again , giving them a national centre , such as the English have , though they , too , are scattered over the face of the globe . That task which presents itself to me as a duty .... I am resolved to devote my life to it . AT THE LEAST , I MAY AWAKEN A MOVEMENT IN OTHER MINDS SUCH HAS BEEN AWAKENED IN MY OWN . ’ Could the noble prophetess who wrote the above words have lived but till to-day to see the ever-increasing necessity of adopting her inspired counsel ,... she would have been herself astonished at the flame enkindled by her seed of fire , and the practical shape which the movement projected by her poetic vision is beginning to assume . ”</p>
   <p>In November of 1882 appeared her first “ Epistle to the Hebrews , ” — one of a series of articles written for the “ American Hebrew , ” published weekly through several months . Addressing herself now to a Jewish audience , she sets forth without reserve her views and hopes for Judaism , now passionately holding up the mirror for the shortcomings and peculiarities of her race . She says :—</p>
   <p>“ Every student of the Hebrew language is aware that we have in the conjugation of our verbs a mode known as the ‘ intensive voice , ’ which , by means of an almost imperceptible modification of vowel-points , intensifies the meaning of the primitive root . A similar significance seems to attach to the Jews themselves in connection with the people among whom they dwell . They are the ‘ intensive form ’ of any nationality whose language and customs they adopt .... Influenced by the same causes , they represent the same results ; but the deeper lights and shadows of the Oriental temperament throw their failings , as well as their virtues , into more prominent relief . ”</p>
   <p>In drawing the epistles to a close , February 24 , 1883 , she thus summarizes the special objects she has had in view :—</p>
   <p>“ My chief aim has been to contribute my mite towards arousing that spirit of Jewish enthusiasm which might manifest itself : First , in a return to varied pursuits and broad system of physical and intellectual education adopted by our ancestors ; Second , in a more fraternal and practical movement towards alleviating the sufferings of oppressed Jews in countries less favored than our own ; Third , in a closer and wider study of Hebrew literature and history and finally , in a truer recognition of the large principals of religion , liberty , and law upon which Judaism is founded , and which should draw into harmonious unity Jews of every shade of opinion . ”</p>
   <p>Her interest in Jewish affairs was at its height when she planned a visit abroad , which had been a long-cherished dream , and May 15 , 1883 , she sailed for England , accompanied by a younger sister . We have difficulty in recognizing the tragic priestess we have been portraying in the enthusiastic child of travel who seems new-born into a new world . From the very outset she is in a maze of wonder and delight . At sea she writes :—</p>
   <p>“ Our last day on board ship was a vision of beauty from morning till night ,— the sea like a mirror and the sky dazzling with light . In the afternoon we passed a ship in full sail , near enough to exchange salutes and cheers . After tossing about for six days without seeing a human being , except those on our vessel , even this was a sensation . Then an hour or two before sunset came the great sensation of — land ! At first , nothing but a shadow on the far horizon , like the ghost of a ship ; two or three widely scattered rocks which were the promontories of Ireland , and sooner than we expected we were steaming along low-lying purple hills . ”</p>
   <p>The journey to Chester gives her “ the first glimpse of mellow England , ” — a surprise which is yet no surprise , so well known and familiar does it appear . Then Chester , with its quaint , picturesque streets , “ like the scene of a Walter Scott novel , the cathedral planted in greenness , and the clear , gray river where a boatful of scarlet dragoons goes gliding by . ” Everything is a picture for her special benefit . She “ drinks in , at every sense , the sights , sounds , and smells , and the unimaginable beauty of it all . ” Then the bewilderment of London , and a whirl of people , sights , and impressions . She was received with great distinction by the Jews , and many of the leading men among them warmly advocated her views . But it was not alone from her own people that she met with exceptional consideration . She had the privilege of seeing many of the most eminent personages of the day , all of whom honored her with special and personal regard . There was , no doubt , something that strongly attracted people to her at this time ,— the force of her intellect at once made itself felt , while at the same time the unaltered simplicity and modesty of her character , and her readiness and freshness of enthusiasm , kept her still almost like a child .</p>
   <p>She makes a flying visit to Paris , where she happens to be on the 14th of July , the anniversary of the storming of the Bastile , and of the beginning of the republic ; she drives to Versailles , “ that gorgeous shell of royalty , where the crowd who celebrate the birth of the republic wander freely through the halls and avenues , and into the most sacred rooms of the king .... There are ruins on every side in Paris , ” she says ; “ ruins of the Commune , or the Siege , or the Revolution ; it is terrible — it seems as if the city were seared with fire and blood . ”</p>
   <p>Such was Paris to her then , and she hastens back to her beloved London , starting from there on the tour through England that has been mapped out for her . “ A Day in Surrey with William Morris , ” published in “ The Century Magazine , ” describes her visit to Merton Abbey , the old Norman monastery , converted into a model factory by the poet-humanitarian , who himself received her as his guest , conducted her all over the picturesque building and garden , and explained to her his views of art and his aims for the people .</p>
   <p>She drives through Kent , “ where the fields , valleys , and slopes are garlanded with hops and ablaze with scarlet poppies . ” Then Canterbury , Windsor , and Oxford , Stratford , Warwick , the valley of the Wye , Wells , Exeter , and Salisbury ,— cathedral after cathedral . Back to London , and then north through York , Durham , and Edinburgh , and on the 15th of September she sails for home . We have merely named the names , for it is impossible to convey an idea of the delight and importance of this trip , “ a crescendo of enjoyment , ” as she herself calls it . Long after , in strange , dark hours of suffering , these pictures of travel arose before her , vivid and tragic even in their hold and spell upon her .</p>
   <p>The winter of 1883-84 was not especially productive . She wrote a few reminiscences of her journey and occasional poems on the Jewish themes , which appeared in the “ American Hebrew ; ” but for the most part gave herself up to quiet retrospect and enjoyment with her friends of the life she had had a glimpse of , and the experience she had stored ,— a restful , happy period . In August of the same year she was stricken with a severe and dangerous malady , from which she slowly recovered , only to go through a terrible ordeal and affliction . Her father 's health , which had long been failing , now broke down completely , and the whole winter was one long strain of acute anxiety , which culminated in his death , in March , 1885 . The blow was a crushing one for Emma . Truly , the silver cord was loosed , and the golden bowl broken . Life lost its meaning and charm . Her father 's sympathy and pride in her work had been her chief incentive and ambition , and had spurred her on when her own confidence and spirit failed . Never afterwards did she find complete and spontaneous expression . She decided to go abroad as the best means of regaining composure and strength and sailed once more in May for England , where she was welcomed now by the friends she had made , almost as to another home . She spent the summer very quietly at Richmond , an ideally beautiful spot in Yorkshire , where she soon felt the beneficial influence of her peaceful surroundings . “ The very air seems to rest one here , ” she writes ; and inspired by the romantic loveliness of the place , she even composed the first few chapters of a novel , begun with a good deal of dash and vigor , but soon abandoned , for she was still struggling with depression and gloom .</p>
   <p>“ I have neither ability , energy , nor purpose , ” she writes . “ It is impossible to do anything , so I am forced to set it aside for the present ; whether to take it up again or not in the future remains to be seen . ”</p>
   <p>In the autumn she goes on the Continent , visiting the Hague , which “ completely fascinates ” her , and where she feels “ stronger and more cheerful ” than she has “ for many a day . ” Then Paris , which this time amazes her “ with its splendor and magnificence . All the ghosts of the Revolution are somehow laid , ” she writes , and she spends six weeks here enjoying to the full the gorgeous autumn weather , the sights , the picture galleries , the bookshops , the whole brilliant panorama of the life ; and early in December she starts for Italy .</p>
   <p>And now once more we come upon that keen zest of enjoyment , that pure desire and delight of the eyes , which are the prerogative of the poet ,— Emma Lazarus was a poet . The beauty of the world ,— what a rapture and intoxication it is , and how it bursts upon her in the very land of beauty , “ where Dante and Petrarch trod ! ” A magic glow colours it all ; no mere blues and greens anymore , but a splendor of purple and scarlet and emerald ; “ each tower , castle , and village shining like a jewel ; the olive , the fig , and at your feet the roses , growing in mid-December . ” A day in Pisa seems like a week , so crowded is it with sensations and unforgettable pictures . Then a month in Florence , which is still more entrancing with its inexhaustible treasures of beauty and art ; and finally Rome , the climax of it all ,—</p>
   <p>“ wiping out all other places and impressions , and opening a whole new world of sensations . I am wild with the excitement of this tremendous place . I have been here a week , and have seen the Vatican and the Capitoline Museums , and the Sistine Chapel , and St. Peter 's , besides the ruins on the streets and on the hills , and the graves of Shelley and Keats .</p>
   <p>“ It is all heart-breaking . I do n't only mean those beautiful graves , overgrown with acanthus and violets , but the mutilated arches and columns and dumb appealing fragments looming up in the glowing sunshine under the Roman blue sky . ”</p>
   <p>True to her old attractions , it is pagan Rome that appeals to her most strongly ,—</p>
   <p>“ and the far-away past , that seems so sad and strange and near . I am even out of humor with pictures ; a bit of broken stone or a fragment of a bas-relief , or a Corinthian column standing out against this lapis-lazuli sky , or a tremendous arch , are the only things I can look at for the moment ,— except the Sistine Chapel , which is as gigantic as the rest , and forces itself upon you with equal might . ”</p>
   <p>Already , in February , spring is in the air ; “ the almond-trees are in bloom , violets cover the grass , and oh ! the divine , the celestial , the unheard-of beauty of it all ! ” It is almost a pang for her , “ with its strange mixture of longing and regret and delight , ” and in the midst of it she says , “ I have to exert all my strength not to lose myself in morbidness and depression . ”</p>
   <p>Early in March she leaves Rome , consoled with the thought of returning the following winter . In June she was in England again , and spent the summer at Malvern . Disease was no doubt already beginning to prey upon her , for she was oppressed at times by a languor and heaviness amounting almost to lethargy . When she returned to London , however , in September , she felt quite well again , and started for another tour in Holland , which she enjoyed as much as before . She then settled in Paris , to await the time when she could return to Italy . But she was attacked at once with grave and alarming symptoms , that betokened a fatal end to her malady . Entirely ignorant , however , of the danger that threatened her , she kept up courage and hope , made plans for the journey , and looked forward to setting out at any moment . But the weeks passed and the months also ; slowly and gradually the hope faded . The journey to Italy must be given up ; she was not in condition to be brought home , and she reluctantly resigned herself to remain where she was and “ convalesce , ” as she confidently believed , in the spring . Once again came the analogy , which she herself pointed out now , to Heine on his mattress-grave in Paris . She , too , the last time she went out , dragged herself to the Louvre , to the feet of the Venus , “ the goddess without arms , who could not help . ” Only her indomitable will and intense desire to live seemed to keep her alive . She sunk to a very low ebb , but , as she herself expressed it , she “ seemed to have always one little window looking out into life , ” and in the spring she rallied sufficiently to take a few drives and to sit on the balcony of her apartment . She came back to life with a feverish sort of thirst and avidity . “ No such cure for pessimism , ” she says , “ as a severe illness ; the simplest pleasures are enough ,— to breathe the air and see the sun . ”</p>
   <p>Many plans were made for leaving Paris , but it was finally decided to risk the ocean voyage and bring her home , and accordingly she sailed July 23rd , arriving in New York on the last day of that month .</p>
   <p>She did not rally after this ; and now began her long agony , full of every kind of suffering , mental and physical . Only her intellect seemed kindled anew , and none but those who saw her during the last supreme ordeal can realize that wonderful flash and fire of the spirit before its extinction . Never did she appear so brilliant . Wasted to a shadow , and between acute attacks of pain , she talked about art , poetry , the scenes of travel , of which her brain was so full , and the phases of her own condition , with an eloquence for which even those who knew her best were quite unprepared . Every faculty seemed sharpened and every sense quickened as the “ strong deliveress ” approached , and the ardent soul was released from the frame that could no longer contain it .</p>
   <p>We cannot restrain a feeling of suddenness and incompleteness and a natural pang of wonder and regret for a life so richly and so vitally endowed thus cut off in its prime . But for us it is not fitting to question or repine , but rather to rejoice in the rare possession that we hold . What is any life , even the most rounded and complete , but a fragment and a hint ? What Emma Lazarus might have accomplished , had she been spared , it is idle and even ungrateful to speculate . What she did accomplish has real and peculiar significance . It is the privilege of a favored few that every fact and circumstance of their individuality shall add lustre and value to what they achieve . To be born a Jewess was a distinction for Emma Lazarus , and she in turn conferred distinction upon her race . To be born a woman also lends a grace and a subtle magnetism to her influence . Nowhere is there contradiction or incongruity . Her works bear the imprint of her character , and her character of her works ; the same directness and honesty , the same limpid purity of tone , and the same atmosphere of things refined and beautiful . The vulgar , the false , and the ignoble ,— she scarcely comprehended them , while on every side she was open and ready to take in and respond to whatever can adorn and enrich life . Literature was no mere “ profession ” for her , which shut out other possibilities ; it was only a free , wide horizon and background for culture . She was passionately devoted to music , which inspired some of her best poems ; and during the last years of her life , in hours of intense physical suffering , she found relief and consolation in listening to the strains of Bach and Beethoven . When she went abroad , painting was revealed to her , and she threw herself with the same ardor and enthusiasm into the study of the great masters ; her last work ( left unfinished ) was a critical analysis of the genius and personality of Rembrandt .</p>
   <p>And now , at the end , we ask , Has the grave really closed over all these gifts ? Has that eager , passionate striving ceased , and “ is the rest silence ? ”</p>
   <p>Who knows ? But would we break , if we could , that repose , that silence and mystery and peace everlasting ?</p>

     <l n="75">Although with him they acted as he willed ,</l>
     <l n="76">Renouncing shepherds ’ silly pranks and quips ,</l>
     <l n="77">Because his very presence made them grave .</l>
     <l n="78">Amphryssius , after their translucent stream ,</l>
     <l n="79">They called him , but Admetus knew his name ,—</l>
     <l n="80">Hyperion , god of sun and song and silver speech ,</l>
     <l n="81">Condemned to serve a mortal for his sin</l>
     <l n="82">To Zeus in sending violent darts of death ,</l>
     <l n="83">A raising hand irreverent , against</l>
     <l n="84">The one-eyed forgers of the thunderbolt .</l>
     <l n="85">For shepherd 's crook he held the living rod</l>
     <l n="86">Of twisted serpents , later Hermes ’ wand .</l>
     <l n="87">Him sought the king , discovering soon hard by ,</l>
     <l n="88">Idle as one in nowise bound to time ,</l>
     <l n="89">Watching the restless grasses blow and wave ,</l>
     <l n="90">The sparkle of the sun upon the stream ,</l>
     <l n="91">Regretting nothing , living with the hour :</l>
     <l n="92">For him , who had his light and song within ,</l>
     <l n="93">Was naught that did not shine , and all things sang .</l>
     <l n="94">Admetus prayed for his celestial aid</l>
     <l n="95">To win Alcestis , which the god vouchsafed ,</l>
     <l n="96">Granting with smiles , as grant all gods , who smite</l>
     <l n="97">With stern hand , sparing not for piteousness ,</l>
     <l n="98">But give their gifts in gladness .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="99">Thus the king</l>
     <l n="100">Led with loose rein the beasts as tame as kine ,</l>
     <l n="101">And townsfolk thronged within the city streets ,</l>
     <l n="102">As round a god ; and mothers showed their babes ,</l>
     <l n="103">And maidens loved the crowned intrepid youth ,</l>
     <l n="104">And men aloud worship , though the very god</l>
     <l n="105">Who wrought the wonder dwelled unnoted nigh ,</l>
     <l n="106">Divinely scornful of neglect or praise .</l>
     <l n="107">Then Pelias , seeing this would be his son ,</l>
     <l n="108">As he had vowed , called for his wife and child .</l>
     <l n="109">With Anaxibia , Alcestis came ,</l>
     <l n="110">A warm flush spreading o'er her eager face</l>
     <l n="111">In looking on the rider of the woods ,</l>
     <l n="112">And knowing him her suitor and the king .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="113">Admetus won Alcestis thus to wife ,</l>
     <l n="114">And these with mated hearts and mutual love</l>
     <l n="115">Lived a life blameless , beautiful : the king</l>
     <l n="116">Ordaining justice in the gates ; the queen ,</l>
     <l n="117">With grateful offerings to the household gods ,</l>
     <l n="118">Wise with the wisdom of the pure in heart .</l>
     <l n="119">One child she bore ,— Eumelus ,— and he throve .</l>
     <l n="120">Yet none the less because they sacrificed</l>
     <l n="121">The firstlings of their flocks and fruits and flowers ,</l>
     <l n="122">Did trouble come ; for sickness seized the king .</l>
     <l n="123">Alcestis watched with many-handed love ,</l>
     <l n="124">But unavailing service , for he lay</l>
     <l n="125">With languid limbs , despite his ancient strength</l>
     <l n="126">Of sinew , and his skill with spear and sword .</l>
     <l n="127">His mother came , Clymene , and with her</l>
     <l n="128">His father , Pheres : his unconscious child</l>
     <l n="129">They brought him , while forlorn Alcestis sat</l>
     <l n="130">Discouraged , with the face of desolation .</l>
     <l n="131">The jealous gods would bind his mouth from speech ,</l>
     <l n="132">And smite his vigorous frame with impotence ;</l>
     <l n="133">And ruin with bitter ashes , worms , and dust ,</l>
     <l n="134">The beauty of his crowned , exalted head .</l>
     <l n="135">He knew her presence ,— soon he would not know ,</l>
     <l n="136">Nor feel her hand in his lie warm and close ,</l>
     <l n="137">Nor care if she were near him any more .</l>
     <l n="138">Exhausted with long vigils , thus the queen</l>
     <l n="139">Held hard and grievous thoughts , till heavy sleep</l>
     <l n="140">Possessed her weary sense , and she dreamed .</l>
     <l n="141">And even in her dream her trouble lived ,</l>
     <l n="142">For she was praying in a barren field</l>
     <l n="143">To all the gods for help , when came across</l>
     <l n="144">The waste of air and land , from distant skies ,</l>
     <l n="145">A spiritual voice divinely clear ,</l>
     <l n="146">Whose unimaginable sweetness thrilled</l>
     <l n="147">Her aching heart with tremor of strange joy :</l>
     <l n="148">“ Arise , Alcestis , cast away white fear .</l>
     <l n="149">A god dwells with you : seek , and you shall find . ”</l>
     <l n="150">Then quiet satisfaction filled her soul</l>
     <l n="151">Almost akin to gladness , and she woke .</l>
     <l n="152">Weak as the dead , Admetus lay there still ;</l>
     <l n="153">But she , superb with confidence , arose ,</l>
     <l n="154">And passed beyond the mourners ’ curious eyes ,</l>
     <l n="155">Seeking Amphryssius in the meadow-lands .</l>
     <l n="156">She found him with the godlike mien of one</l>
     <l n="157">Who , roused , awakens unto deeds divine :</l>
     <l n="158">“ I come , Hyperion , with incessant tears ,</l>
     <l n="159">To crave the life of my dear lord the king .</l>
     <l n="160">Pity me , for I see the future years</l>
     <l n="161">Widowed and laden with disastrous days .</l>
     <l n="162">And ye , the gods , will miss him when the fires</l>
     <l n="163">Upon your shrines , unfed , neglected die .</l>
     <l n="164">Who will pour large libations in your names ,</l>
     <l n="165">And sacrifice with generous piety ?</l>
     <l n="166">Silence and apathy will greet you there</l>
     <l n="167">Where once a splendid spirit offered praise .</l>
     <l n="168">Grant me this boon divine , and I will beat</l>
     <l n="169">With prayer at morning 's gates , before they ope</l>
     <l n="170">Unto thy silver-hoofed and flame-eyed steeds .</l>
     <l n="171">Answer ere yet the irremeable stream</l>
     <l n="172">Be crossed : answer , O god , and save ! ”</l>
     <l n="173">She ceased ,</l>
     <l n="174">With full throat salt with tears , and looked on him ,</l>
     <l n="175">And with a sudden cry of awe fell prone ,</l>
     <l n="176">For , lo ! he was transmuted to a god ;</l>
     <l n="177">The supreme aureole radiant round his brow ,</l>
     <l n="178">Divine refulgences on his face ,— his eyes</l>
     <l n="179">Awful with splendor , and his august head</l>
     <l n="180">With blinding brilliance crowned by vivid flame .</l>
     <l n="181">Then in a voice that charmed the listening air :</l>
     <l n="182">“ Woman , arise ! I have no influence</l>
     <l n="183">On Death , who is the servant of the Fates .</l>
     <l n="184">Howbeit for thy passion and thy prayer ,</l>
     <l n="185">The grace of thy fair womanhood and youth ,</l>
     <l n="186">Thus godlike will I intercede for thee ,</l>
     <l n="187">And sue the insatiate sisters for this life .</l>
     <l n="188">Yet hope not blindly : loth are these to change</l>
     <l n="189">Their purpose ; neither will they freely give ,</l>
     <l n="190">But haggling lend or sell : perchance the price</l>
     <l n="191">Will counterveil the boon . Consider this .</l>
     <l n="192">Now rise and look upon me . ” And she rose ,</l>
     <l n="193">But by her stood no godhead bathed in light ,</l>
     <l n="194">But young Amphryssius , herdsman to the king ,</l>
     <l n="195">Benignly smiling .</l>
     <l n="196">Fleet as thought , the god</l>
     <l n="197">Fled from the glittering earth to blackest depths</l>
     <l n="198">Of Tartarus ; and none might say he sped</l>
     <l n="199">On wings ambrosial , or with feet as swift</l>
     <l n="200">As scouring hail , or airy chariot</l>
     <l n="201">Borne by the flame-breathing steeds ethereal ;</l>
     <l n="202">But with a motion inconceivable</l>
     <l n="203">Departed and was there . Before the throne</l>
     <l n="204">Of Ades , first he hailed the long-sought queen ,</l>
     <l n="205">Stolen with violent hands from grassy fields</l>
     <l n="206">And delicate airs of sunlit Sicily ,</l>
     <l n="207">Pensive , gold-haired , but innocent-eyed no more</l>
     <l n="208">As when she laughing plucked the daffodils ,</l>
     <l n="209">But grave as on fulfilling a strange doom .</l>
     <l n="210">And low at Ades ’ feet , wrapped in grim murk</l>
     <l n="211">And darkness thick , the three gray women sat ,</l>
     <l n="212">Loose-robed and chapleted with wool and flowers ,</l>
     <l n="213">Purple narcissi round their horrid hair .</l>
     <l n="214">Intent upon her task , the first one held</l>
     <l n="215">The tender thread that at a touch would snap ;</l>
     <l n="216">The second weaving it with warp and woof</l>
     <l n="217">Into strange textures , some stained dark and foul ,</l>
     <l n="218">Some sanguine-colored , and some black as night ,</l>
     <l n="219">And rare ones white , or with a golden thread</l>
     <l n="220">Running throughout the web : the farthest hag</l>
     <l n="221">With glistening scissors cut her sisters ’ work .</l>
     <l n="222">To these Hyperion , but they never ceased ,</l>
     <l n="223">Nor raised their eyes , till with soft , moderate tones ,</l>
     <l n="224">But by their powerful persuasiveness</l>
     <l n="225">Commanding all to listen and obey ,</l>
     <l n="226">He spoke , and all hell heard , and these three looked</l>
     <l n="227">And waited his request :</l>
     <l n="228">I come , a god ,</l>
     <l n="229">At pure mortal queen 's request , who sues</l>
     <l n="230">For life renewed unto her dying lord ,</l>
     <l n="231">Admetus ; and I also pray this prayer . ”</l>
     <l n="232">“ Then cease , for when hath Fate been moved by prayer ? ”</l>
     <l n="233">“ But strength and upright heart should serve with you . ”</l>
     <l n="234">“ I ask ye not forever to forbear ,</l>
     <l n="235">But spare a while ,— a moment unto us ,</l>
     <l n="236">A lifetime unto men . ” “ The Fates swerve not</l>
     <l n="237">For supplications , like the pliant gods .</l>
     <l n="238">Have they not willed a life 's thread should be cut ?</l>
     <l n="239">With them the will is changeless as the deed .</l>
     <l n="240">O men ! ye have not learned in all the past ,</l>
     <l n="241">Desires are barren and tears yield no fruit .</l>
     <l n="242">How long will ye besiege the thrones of gods</l>
     <l n="243">With lamentations ? When lagged Death for all</l>
     <l n="244">Your timorous shirking ? We work not like you ,</l>
     <l n="245">Delaying and relenting , purposeless ,</l>
     <l n="246">With unenduring issues ; but our deeds ,</l>
     <l n="247">Forever interchained and interlocked ,</l>
     <l n="248">Complete each other and explain themselves . ”</l>
     <l n="249">“ Ye will a life : then why not any life ? ”</l>
     <l n="250">“ What care we for the king ? He is not worth</l>
     <l n="251">These many words ; indeed , we love not speech .</l>
     <l n="252">We care not if he live , or lose such life</l>
     <l n="253">As men are greedy for ,— filled full with hate ,</l>
     <l n="254">Sins beneath scorn , and only lit by dreams ,</l>
     <l n="255">Or one sane moment , or a useless hope ,—</l>
     <l n="256">Lasting how long ?— the space between the green</l>
     <l n="257">And fading yellow of the grass they tread . ”</l>
     <l n="258">But he withdrawing not : “ Will any life</l>
     <l n="259">Suffice ye for Admetus ? ” “ Yea , ” the crones</l>
     <l n="260">Three times repeated . “ We know no such names</l>
     <l n="261">As king or queen or slave : we want but life .</l>
     <l n="262">Begone , and vex us in our work no more . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="263">With broken blessings , inarticulate joy</l>
     <l n="264">And tears , Alcestis thanked Hyperion ,</l>
     <l n="265">And worshipped . Then he gently : “ Who will die ,</l>
     <l n="266">So that the king may live ? ” And she : “ You ask ?</l>
     <l n="267">Nay , who will live when life clasps hands with shame ,</l>
     <l n="268">And death with honor ? Lo , you are a god ;</l>
     <l n="269">You cannot know the highest joy of life ,—</l>
     <l n="270">To leave it when ‘ t is worthier to die .</l>
     <l n="271">His parents , kinsmen , courtiers , subjects , slaves ,—</l>
     <l n="272">For love of him myself would die , were none</l>
     <l n="273">Found ready ; but what Greek would stand to see</l>
     <l n="274">A woman glorified , and falter ? Once ,</l>
     <l n="275">And only once , the gods will do this thing</l>
     <l n="276">In all the ages : such a man themselves</l>
     <l n="277">Delight to honor ,— holy , temperate , chaste ,</l>
     <l n="278">With reverence for his daemon and his god . ”</l>
     <l n="279">Thus she triumphant to they very door</l>
     <l n="280">Of King Admetus ’ chamber . All there saw</l>
     <l n="281">Her ill-timed gladness with much wonderment .</l>
     <l n="282">But she : “ No longer mourn ! The king is saved :</l>
     <l n="283">The Fates will spare him . Lift your voice in praise ;</l>
     <l n="284">Sing paeans to Apollo ; crown your brows</l>
     <l n="285">With laurel ; offer thankful sacrifice ! ”</l>
     <l n="286">“ O Queen , what mean these foolish words misplaced ?</l>
     <l n="287">And what an hour is this to thank the Fates ? ”</l>
     <l n="288">“ Thrice blessed be the gods !— for God himself</l>
     <l n="289">Has sued for me ,— they are not stern and deaf .</l>
     <l n="290">Cry , and they answer : commune with your soul ,</l>
     <l n="291">And they send counsel : weep with rainy grief ,</l>
     <l n="292">And these will sweeten you your bitterest tears .</l>
     <l n="293">On one condition King Admetus lives ,</l>
     <l n="294">And ye , on hearing , will lament no more ,</l>
     <l n="295">Each emulous to save . ” Then — for she spake</l>
     <l n="296">Assured , as having heard an oracle —</l>
     <l n="297">They asked : “ What deed of ours may serve the king ? ”</l>
     <l n="298">“ The Fates accept another life for his ,</l>
     <l n="299">And one of you may die . ” Smiling , she ceased .</l>
     <l n="300">But silence answered her . “ What ! do ye thrust</l>
     <l n="301">Your arrows in your hearts beneath your cloaks ,</l>
     <l n="302">Dying like Greeks , too proud to own the pang ?</l>
     <l n="303">This ask I not . In all the populous land</l>
     <l n="304">But one need suffer for immortal praise .</l>
     <l n="305">The generous Fates have sent no pestilence ,</l>
     <l n="306">Famine , nor war : it is as though they gave</l>
     <l n="307">Freely , and only make the boon more rich</l>
     <l n="308">By such slight payment . Now a people mourns ,</l>
     <l n="309">And ye may change the grief to jubilee ,</l>
     <l n="310">Filling the cities with a pleasant sound .</l>
     <l n="311">But as for me , what faltering words can tell</l>
     <l n="312">My joy , in extreme sharpness kin to pain ?</l>
     <l n="313">A monument you have within my heart ,</l>
     <l n="314">Wreathed with kind love and dear remembrances ;</l>
     <l n="315">And I will pray for you before I crave</l>
     <l n="316">Pardon and pity for myself from God .</l>
     <l n="317">Your name will be the highest in the land ,</l>
     <l n="318">Oftenest , fondest on my grateful lips ,</l>
     <l n="319">After the name of him you die to save .</l>
     <l n="320">What ! silent still ? Since when has virtue grown</l>
     <l n="321">Less beautiful than indolence and ease ?</l>
     <l n="322">Is death more terrible , more hateworthy ,</l>
     <l n="323">More bitter than dishonor ? Will ye live</l>
     <l n="324">On shame ? Chew and find sweet its poisoned fruits ?</l>
     <l n="325">What sons will ye bring forth — mean-souled like you ,</l>
     <l n="326">Or , like your parents , brave — to blush like girls ,</l>
     <l n="327">And say ,' Our fathers were afraid to die ! ’</l>
     <l n="328">Ye will not dare to raise heroic eyes</l>
     <l n="329">Unto the eyes of aliens . In the streets</l>
     <l n="330">Will women and young children point at you</l>
     <l n="331">Scornfully , and the sun will find you shamed ,</l>
     <l n="332">And night refuse to shield you . What a life</l>
     <l n="333">Is this ye spin and fashion for yourselves !</l>
     <l n="334">And what new tortures of suspense and doubt</l>
     <l n="335">Will death invent for such as are afraid !</l>
     <l n="336">Acastus , thou my brother , in the field</l>
     <l n="337">Foremost , who greeted me with sanguine hands</l>
     <l n="338">From ruddy battle with a conqueror 's face ,—</l>
     <l n="339">These honors wilt thou blot with infamy ?</l>
     <l n="340">Nay , thou hast won no honors : a mere girl</l>
     <l n="341">Would do as much as thou at such a time ,</l>
     <l n="342">In clamorous battle ,' midst tumultuous sounds ,</l>
     <l n="343">Neighing of war-steeds , shouts of sharp command ,</l>
     <l n="344">Snapping of shivered spears ; for all are brave</l>
     <l n="345">When all men look to them expectantly ;</l>
     <l n="346">But he is truly brave who faces death</l>
     <l n="347">Within his chamber , at a sudden call ,</l>
     <l n="348">At night , when no man sees ,— content to die</l>
     <l n="349">When life can serve no longer those he loves . ”</l>
     <l n="350">Then thus Acastus : “ Sister , I fear not</l>
     <l n="351">Death , nor the empty darkness of the grave ,</l>
     <l n="352">And hold my life but as a little thing ,</l>
     <l n="353">Subject unto my people 's call , and Fate .</l>
     <l n="354">But if ‘ t is little , no greater is the king 's ;</l>
     <l n="355">And though my heart bleeds sorely , I recall</l>
     <l n="356">Astydamia , who thus would mourn for me .</l>
     <l n="357">We are not cowards , we youth of Thessaly ,</l>
     <l n="358">And Thessaly — yea , all Greece — knoweth it ;</l>
     <l n="359">Nor will we brook the name from even you ,</l>
     <l n="360">Albeit a queen , and uttering these wild words</l>
     <l n="361">Through your umwonted sorrow . ” Then she knew</l>
     <l n="362">That he stood firm , and turning from him , cried</l>
     <l n="363">To the king 's parents : “ Are ye deaf with grief ,</l>
     <l n="364">Pheres , Clymene ? Ye can save your son ,</l>
     <l n="365">Yet rather stand and weep with barren tears .</l>
     <l n="366">O , shame ! to think that such gray , reverend hairs</l>
     <l n="367">Should cover such unvenerable heads !</l>
     <l n="368">What would ye lose ?— a remnant of mere life ,</l>
     <l n="369">A few slight raveled threads , and give him years</l>
     <l n="370">To fill with glory . Who , when he is gone ,</l>
     <l n="371">Will call you gentlest names this side of heaven ,—</l>
     <l n="372">Father and mother ? Knew ye not this man</l>
     <l n="373">Ere he was royal ,— a poor , helpless child ,</l>
     <l n="374">Crownless and kingdomless ? One birth alone</l>
     <l n="375">Sufficeth not , Clymene : once again</l>
     <l n="376">You must give life with travail and strong pain .</l>
     <l n="377">Has he not lived to outstrip your swift hopes ?</l>
     <l n="378">What mother can refuse a second birth</l>
     <l n="379">To such a son ? But ye denying him ,</l>
     <l n="380">What after-offering may appease the gods ?</l>
     <l n="381">What joy outweigh the grief of this one day ?</l>
     <l n="382">What clamor drown the hours ’ myriad tongues ,</l>
     <l n="383">Crying , ‘ Your son , your son ? where is your son ,</l>
     <l n="384">Unnatural mother , timid foolish man ? ”</l>
     <l n="385">Then Pheres gravely : “ These are graceless words</l>
     <l n="386">From you our daughter . Life is always life ,</l>
     <l n="387">And death comes soon enough to such as we .</l>

     <l n="391">“ O gods ! look on your creatures ! do ye see ?</l>
     <l n="392">And seeing , have ye patience ? Smite them all ,</l>

     <l n="395">Intrepid , with exalted steadfast soul ,</l>
     <l n="396">Scorn in my heart , and love unutterable ,</l>
     <l n="397">I yield the Fates my life , and like a god</l>
     <l n="398">Command them to revere that sacred head .</l>
     <l n="399">Thus kiss I thrice the dear , blind , holy eyes ,</l>
     <l n="400">And bid them see ; and thrice I kiss this brow ,</l>
     <l n="401">And thus unfasten I the pale , proud lips</l>
     <l n="402">With fruitful kissings , bringing love and life ,</l>

     <l n="407">For , lo ! thy life-blood tingles in my veins ,</l>
     <l n="408">And streameth through my body like new wine .</l>
     <l n="409">Behold ! thy spirit dedicate revives</l>
     <l n="410">My pulse , and through thy sacrifice I breathe .</l>
     <l n="411">Thy lips are bloodless : kiss me not again .</l>

     <l n="414">And in thy wifehood , I adjure thee now</l>
     <l n="415">As mother , by the love thou bearest our child ,</l>
     <l n="416">In this thy hour of passion and of love ,</l>
     <l n="417">Of sacrifice and sorrow , to unsay</l>
     <l n="418">Thy words sublime ! ” “ I die that thou mayest live . ”</l>
     <l n="419">“ And deemest thou that I accept the boon ,</l>
     <l n="420">Craven , like these my subjects ? Lo , my queen ,</l>
     <l n="421">Is life itself a lovely thing ,— bare life ?</l>
     <l n="422">And empty breath a thing desirable ?</l>
     <l n="423">Or is it rather happiness and love</l>
     <l n="424">That make it precious to its inmost core ?</l>
     <l n="425">When these are lost , are there not swords in Greece ,</l>
     <l n="426">And flame and poison , deadly waves and plagues ?</l>
     <l n="427">No man has ever lacked these things and gone</l>
     <l n="428">Unsatisfied . It is not these the gods refuse</l>
     <l n="429">( Nay , never clutch my sleeve and raise thy lip ) ,—</l>
     <l n="430">Not these I seek ; but I will stab myself ,</l>
     <l n="431">Poison my life and burn my flesh , with words ,</l>
     <l n="432">And save or follow thee . Lo ! hearken now :</l>
     <l n="433">I bid the gods take back their loathsome gifts :</l>
     <l n="434">O spurn them , and I scorn them , and I hate .</l>
     <l n="435">Will they prove deaf to this as to my prayers ?</l>
     <l n="436">With tongue reviling , blasphemous , I curse ,</l>
     <l n="437">With mouth polluted from deliberate heart .</l>
     <l n="438">Dishonored be their names , scorned be their priests ,</l>
     <l n="439">Ruined their altars , mocked their oracles !</l>
     <l n="440">It is Admetus , King of Thessaly ,</l>
     <l n="441">Defaming thus : annihilate him , gods !</l>
     <l n="442">So that his queen , who worships you , may live . ”</l>
     <l n="443">He paused as one expectant ; but no bolt</l>
     <l n="444">From the insulted heavens answered him ,</l>
     <l n="445">But awful silence followed . Then a hand ,</l>
     <l n="446">A boyish hand , upon his shoulder fell ,</l>
     <l n="447">And turning , he beheld his shepherd boy ,</l>
     <l n="448">Not wrathful , but divinely pitiful ,</l>
     <l n="449">Who spake in tender , thrilling tones : “ The gods</l>
     <l n="450">Cannot recall their gifts . Blaspheme them not :</l>
     <l n="451">Bow down and worship rather . Shall he curse</l>
     <l n="452">Who sees not , and who hears not ,— neither knows</l>
     <l n="453">Nor understands ? Nay , thou shalt bless and pray ,—</l>
     <l n="454">Pray , for the pure heart purged by prayer , divines</l>
     <l n="455">And seeth when the bolder eyes are blind .</l>
     <l n="456">Worship and wonder ,— these befit a man</l>
     <l n="457">At every hour ; and mayhap will the gods</l>
     <l n="458">Yet work a miracle for knees that bend</l>
     <l n="459">And hands that supplicate . ”</l>
     <l n="460">Then all they knew</l>
     <l n="461">A sudden sense of awe , and bowed their heads</l>
     <l n="462">Beneath the stripling 's gaze : Admetus fell ,</l>
     <l n="463">Crushed by that gentle touch , and cried aloud :</l>
     <l n="464">“ Pardon and pity ! I am hard beset . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="465">There waited at the doorway of the king</l>
     <l n="466">One grim and ghastly , shadowy , horrible ,</l>
     <l n="467">Bearing the likeness of a king himself ,</l>
     <l n="468">Erect as one who serveth not ,— upon</l>
     <l n="469">His head a crown , within his fleshless hands</l>
     <l n="470">A sceptre ,— monstrous , winged , intolerable .</l>
     <l n="471">To him a stranger coming ‘ neath the trees ,</l>
     <l n="472">Which slid down flakes of light , now on his hair ,</l>
     <l n="473">Close-curled , now on his bared and brawny chest ,</l>
     <l n="474">Now on his flexile , vine-like veined limbs ,</l>
     <l n="475">With iron network of strong muscle thewed ,</l>
     <l n="476">And godlike brows and proud mouth unrelaxed .</l>
     <l n="477">Firm was his step ; no superfluity</l>
     <l n="478">Of indolent flesh impeded this man 's strength .</l>
     <l n="479">Slender and supple every perfect limb ,</l>
     <l n="480">Beautiful with the glory of a man .</l>
     <l n="481">No weapons bare he , neither shield : his hands</l>
     <l n="482">Folded upon his breast , his movements free</l>
     <l n="483">Of all incumbrance . When his mighty strides</l>
     <l n="484">Had brought him nigh the waiting one , he paused :</l>
     <l n="485">“ Whose palace this ? and who art thou , grim shade ? ”</l>
     <l n="486">“ The palace of the King of Thessaly ,</l>
     <l n="487">And my name is not strange unto thine ears ;</l>

     <l n="495">“ Alcestis , Queen of Thessaly ,— a queen</l>

     <l n="498">Admetus , as the Fates decreed . I wait</l>

     <l n="501">And kiss her lips , and kiss her throbbing heart ,</l>
     <l n="502">And then the tenderest hands can do no more</l>

     <l n="505">“ This woman is a god , a hero , Death .</l>

     <l n="507">Luminous , starry : earth can spare her not :</l>
     <l n="508">It is not rich enough in purity</l>
     <l n="509">To lose this paragon . Save her , O Death !</l>
     <l n="510">Thou surely art more gentle than the Fates ,</l>
     <l n="511">Yet these have spared her lord , and never meant</l>
     <l n="512">That she should suffer , and that this their grace ,</l>
     <l n="513">Beautiful , royal on one side , should turn</l>
     <l n="514">Sudden and show a fearful , fatal face . ”</l>
     <l n="515">“ Nay , have they not ? O fond and foolish man ,</l>
     <l n="516">Naught comes unlooked for , unforeseen by them .</l>

     <l n="518">When they have scourged thee with an iron scourge .</l>
     <l n="519">Behold , their smile is deadlier than their sting ,</l>
     <l n="520">And every boon of theirs is double-faced .</l>
     <l n="521">Yea , I am gentler unto ye than these :</l>
     <l n="522">I slay relentless , but when have I mocked</l>
     <l n="523">With poisoned gifts , and generous hands that smite</l>
     <l n="524">Under the flowers ? for my name is Truth .</l>
     <l n="525">Were this fair queen more fair , more pure , more chaste ,</l>
     <l n="526">I would not spare her for your wildest prayer</l>
     <l n="527">Nor her best virtue . Is the earth 's mouth full ?</l>
     <l n="528">Is the grave satisfied ? Discrown me then ,</l>
     <l n="529">For life is lord , and men may mock the gods</l>
     <l n="530">With immortality . ” “ I sue no more ,</l>

     <l n="533">Thou puny boy ! ” And Death laughed loud , and swelled</l>
     <l n="534">To monstrous bulk , fierce-eyed , with outstretched wings ,</l>
     <l n="535">And lightnings round his brow ; but grave and firm ,</l>
     <l n="536">Strong as a tower , Alcides waited him ,</l>
     <l n="537">And these began to wrestle , and a cloud</l>

     <l n="562">Saving the king , who paused not in his prayer :</l>

     <l n="1">To my mother . May , 1870 .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">The Landgrave Hermann held a gathering</l>
     <l n="3">Of minstrels , minnesingers , troubadours ,</l>
     <l n="4">At Wartburg in his palace , and the knight ,</l>
     <l n="5">Sir Tannhauser of France , the greatest bard ,</l>
     <l n="6">Inspired with heavenly visions , and endowed</l>
     <l n="7">With apprehension and rare utterance</l>
     <l n="8">Of noble music , fared in thoughtful wise</l>
     <l n="9">Across the Horsel meadows . Full of light ,</l>
     <l n="10">And large repose , the peaceful valley lay ,</l>
     <l n="11">In the late splendor of the afternoon ,</l>
     <l n="12">And level sunbeams lit the serious face</l>
     <l n="13">Of the young knight , who journeyed to the west ,</l>
     <l n="14">Towards the precipitous and rugged cliffs ,</l>
     <l n="15">Scarred , grim , and torn with savage rifts and chasms ,</l>
     <l n="16">That in the distance loomed as soft and fair</l>
     <l n="17">And purple as their shadows on the grass .</l>
     <l n="18">The tinkling chimes ran out athwart the air ,</l>
     <l n="19">Proclaiming sunset , ushering evening in ,</l>
     <l n="20">Although the sky yet glowed with yellow light .</l>
     <l n="21">The ploughboy , ere he led his cattle home ,</l>
     <l n="22">In the near meadow , reverently knelt ,</l>
     <l n="23">And doffed his cap , and duly crossed his breast ,</l>
     <l n="24">Whispering his “ Ave Mary , ” as he heard</l>
     <l n="25">The pealing vesper-bell . But still the knight ,</l>
     <l n="26">Unmindful of the sacred hour announced ,</l>
     <l n="27">Disdainful or unconscious , held his course .</l>
     <l n="28">“ Would that I also , like yon stupid wight ,</l>
     <l n="29">Could kneel and hail the Virgin and believe ! ”</l>
     <l n="30">He murmured bitterly beneath his breath .</l>
     <l n="31">“ Were I a pagan , riding to contend</l>
     <l n="32">For the Olympic wreath , O with what zeal ,</l>
     <l n="33">What fire of inspiration , would I sing</l>
     <l n="34">The praises of the gods ! How may my lyre</l>
     <l n="35">Glorify these whose very life I doubt ?</l>
     <l n="36">The world is governed by one cruel God ,</l>
     <l n="37">Who brings a sword , not peace . A pallid Christ ,</l>
     <l n="38">Unnatural , perfect , and a virgin cold ,</l>
     <l n="39">They give us for a heaven of living gods ,</l>
     <l n="40">Beautiful , loving , whose mere names were song ;</l>
     <l n="41">A creed of suffering and despair , walled in</l>
     <l n="42">On every side by brazen boundaries ,</l>
     <l n="43">That limit the soul 's vision and her hope</l>
     <l n="44">To a red hell or and unpeopled heaven .</l>
     <l n="45">Yea , I am lost already ,— even now</l>
     <l n="46">Am doomed to flaming torture for my thoughts .</l>
     <l n="47">O gods ! O gods ! where shall my soul find peace ? ”</l>
     <l n="48">He raised his wan face to the faded skies ,</l>
     <l n="49">Now shadowing into twilight ; no response</l>
     <l n="50">Came from their sunless heights ; no miracle ,</l>
     <l n="51">As in the ancient days of answering gods .</l>
     <l n="52">With a long , shuddering sigh he glanced to earth ,</l>
     <l n="53">Finding himself among the Horsel cliffs .</l>
     <l n="54">Gray , sullen , gaunt , they towered on either side ;</l>
     <l n="55">Scant shrubs sucked meagre life between the rifts</l>
     <l n="56">Of their huge crags , and made small darker spots</l>
     <l n="57">Upon their wrinkled sides ; the jaded horse</l>
     <l n="58">Stumbled upon loose , rattling , fallen stones ,</l>
     <l n="59">Amidst the gathering dusk , and blindly fared</l>
     <l n="60">Through the weird , perilous pass . As darkness waxed ,</l>
     <l n="61">And an oppressive mystery enwrapped</l>
     <l n="62">The roadstead and the rocks , Sir Tannhauser</l>
     <l n="63">Fancied he saw upon the mountain-side</l>
     <l n="64">The fluttering of white raiment . With a sense</l>
     <l n="65">Of wild joy and horror , he gave pause ,</l>
     <l n="66">For his sagacious horse that reeked of sweat ,</l>
     <l n="67">Trembling in every limb , confirmed his thought ,</l>
     <l n="68">That nothing human scaled that haunted cliff .</l>
     <l n="69">The white thing seemed descending ,— now a cloud</l>
     <l n="70">It looked , and now a rag of drifted mist ,</l>
     <l n="71">Torn in the jagged gorge precipitous ,</l>
     <l n="72">And now an apparition clad in white ,</l>
     <l n="73">Shapely and real ,— then he lost it quite ,</l>
     <l n="74">Gazing on nothing with blank , foolish face .</l>
     <l n="75">As with wide eyes he stood , he was aware</l>
     <l n="76">Of a strange splendor at his very side ,</l>
     <l n="77">A presence and a majesty so great ,</l>
     <l n="78">That ere he saw , he felt it was divine .</l>
     <l n="79">He turned , and , leaping from his horse , fell prone ,</l>
     <l n="80">In speechless adoration , on the earth ,</l>
     <l n="81">Before the matchless goddess , who appeared</l>
     <l n="82">With no less freshness of immortal youth</l>
     <l n="83">Than when first risen from foam of Paphian seas .</l>
     <l n="84">He heard delicious strains of melody ,</l>
     <l n="85">Such as his highest muse had ne'er attained ,</l>
     <l n="86">Float in the air , while in the distance rang ,</l>
     <l n="87">Harsh and discordant , jarring with those tones ,</l>
     <l n="88">The gallop of his frightened horse 's hoofs ,</l>
     <l n="89">Clattering in sudden freedom down the pass .</l>
     <l n="90">A voice that made all music dissonance</l>
     <l n="91">Then thrilled through heart and flesh of that prone knight ,</l>
     <l n="92">Triumphantly : “ The gods need but appear ,</l>
     <l n="93">And their usurped thrones are theirs again ! ”</l>
     <l n="94">Then tenderly : “ Sweet knight , I pray thee , rise ;</l>
     <l n="95">Worship me not , for I desire thy love .</l>
     <l n="96">Look on me , follow me , for I am fain</l>
     <l n="97">Of thy fair , human face . ” He rose and looked ,</l>
     <l n="98">Stirred by that heavenly flattery to the soul .</l>
     <l n="99">Her hair , unbraided and unfilleted ,</l>
     <l n="100">Rained in a glittering shower to the ground ,</l>
     <l n="101">And cast forth lustre . Round her zone was clasped</l>
     <l n="102">The scintillant cestus , stiff with flaming gold ,</l>
     <l n="103">Thicker with restless gems than heaven with stars .</l>
     <l n="104">She might have flung the enchanted wonder forth ;</l>
     <l n="105">Her eyes , her slightest gesture would suffice</l>
     <l n="106">To bind all men in blissful slavery .</l>
     <l n="107">She sprang upon the mountain 's dangerous side ,</l>
     <l n="108">With feet that left their print in flowers divine ,—</l>
     <l n="109">Flushed amaryllis and blue hyacinth ,</l>
     <l n="110">Impurpled amaranth and asphodel ,</l>
     <l n="111">Dewy with nectar , and exhaling scents</l>
     <l n="112">Richer than all the roses of mid-June .</l>
     <l n="113">The knight sped after her , with wild eyes fixed</l>
     <l n="114">Upon her brightness , as she lightly leapt</l>
     <l n="115">From crag to crag , with flying auburn hair ,</l>
     <l n="116">Like a gold cloud , that lured him ever on ,</l>
     <l n="117">Higher and higher up the haunted cliff .</l>
     <l n="118">At last amidst a grove of pines she paused ,</l>
     <l n="119">Until he reached her , breathing hard with haste ,</l>
     <l n="120">Delight , and wonder . Then upon his hand</l>
     <l n="121">She placed her own , and all his blood at once</l>
     <l n="122">Tingled and hotly rushed to brow and cheek ,</l>
     <l n="123">At the supreme caress ; but the mere touch</l>
     <l n="124">Infused fresh life , and when she looked at him</l>
     <l n="125">With gracious tenderness , he felt himself</l>
     <l n="126">Strong suddenly to bear the blinding light</l>
     <l n="127">Of those great eyes . “ Dear knight , ” she murmured low ,</l>
     <l n="128">“ For love of me , wilt thou accord this boon ,—</l>
     <l n="129">To grace my weary home in banishment ? ”</l>
     <l n="130">His hungry eyes gave answer ere he spoke ,</l>
     <l n="131">In tones abrupt that startled his own ears</l>
     <l n="132">With their strange harshness ; but with thanks profuse</l>
     <l n="133">She guided him , still holding his cold hand</l>
     <l n="134">In her warm , dainty palm , unto a cave ,</l>
     <l n="135">Whence a rare glory issued , and a smell</l>
     <l n="136">Of spice and roses , frankincense and balm .</l>
     <l n="137">They entering stood within a marble hall ,</l>
     <l n="138">With straight , slim pillars , at whose farther end</l>
     <l n="139">The goddess led him to a spiral flight</l>
     <l n="140">Of stairs , descending always ‘ midst black gloom</l>
     <l n="141">Into the very bowels of the earth .</l>
     <l n="142">Down these , with fearful swiftness , they made way ,</l>
     <l n="143">The knight 's feet touching not the solid stair ,</l>
     <l n="144">But sliding down as in a vexing dream ,</l>
     <l n="145">Blind , feeling but that hand divine that still</l>
     <l n="146">Empowered him to walk on empty air .</l>
     <l n="147">Then he was dazzled by a sudden blaze ,</l>
     <l n="148">In vast palace filled with reveling folk .</l>
     <l n="149">Cunningly pictured on the ivory walls</l>
     <l n="150">Were rolling hills , cool lakes , and boscage green ,</l>
     <l n="151">And all the summer landscape 's various pomp .</l>
     <l n="152">The precious canopy aloft was carved</l>
     <l n="153">In semblance of the pleached forest trees ,</l>
     <l n="154">Enameled with the liveliest green , wherethrough</l>
     <l n="155">A light pierced , more resplendent than the day .</l>
     <l n="156">O'er the pale , polished jasper of the floor</l>
     <l n="157">Of burnished metal , fretted and embossed</l>
     <l n="158">With all the marvelous story of her birth</l>
     <l n="159">Painted in prodigal splendor of rich tincts ,</l>
     <l n="160">And carved by heavenly artists ,— crystal seas ,</l>
     <l n="161">And long-haired Nereids in their pearly shells ,</l>
     <l n="162">And all the wonder of her lucent limbs</l>
     <l n="163">Sphered in a vermeil mist . Upon the throne</l>
     <l n="164">She took her seat , the knight beside her still ,</l>
     <l n="165">Singing on couches of fresh asphodel ,</l>
     <l n="166">And the dance ceased , and the flushed revelers came</l>
     <l n="167">In glittering phalanx to adore their queen .</l>
     <l n="168">Beautiful girls , with shining delicate heads ,</l>
     <l n="169">Crested with living jewels , fanned the air</l>
     <l n="170">With flickering wings from naked shoulders soft .</l>
     <l n="171">Then with preluding low , a thousand harps ,</l>
     <l n="172">And citherns , and strange nameless instruments ,</l>
     <l n="173">Sent through the fragrant air sweet symphonies ,</l>
     <l n="174">And the winged dancers waved in mazy rounds ,</l>
     <l n="175">With changing lustres like a summer sea .</l>
     <l n="176">Fair boys , with charming yellow hair crisp-curled ,</l>
     <l n="177">And frail , effeminate beauty , the knight saw ,</l>
     <l n="178">But of strong , stalwart men like him were none .</l>
     <l n="179">He gazed thereon bewitched , until the hand</l>
     <l n="180">Of Venus , erst withdrawn , now fell again</l>
     <l n="181">Upon his own , and roused him from his trance .</l>
     <l n="182">He looked on her , and as he looked , a cloud</l>
     <l n="183">Auroral , flaming as at sunrising ,</l>
     <l n="184">Arose from nothing , floating over them</l>
     <l n="185">In luminous folds , like that vermilion mist</l>
     <l n="186">Penciled upon the throne , and as it waxed</l>
     <l n="187">In density and brightness , all the throng</l>
     <l n="188">Of festal dancers , less and less distinct ,</l>
     <l n="189">Grew like pale spirits in a vague , dim dream ,</l>
     <l n="190">And vanished altogether ; and these twain ,</l>
     <l n="191">Shut from the world in that ambrosial cloud ,</l>
     <l n="192">Now with a glory inconceivable ,</l>
     <l n="193">Vivid and conflagrant , looked each on each .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="194">All hours came laden with their own delights</l>
     <l n="195">In that enchanted place , wherein Time</l>
     <l n="196">Knew no divisions harsh of night and day ,</l>
     <l n="197">But light was always , and desire of sleep</l>
     <l n="198">Was satisfied at once with slumber soft ,</l>
     <l n="199">Desire of food with magical repast ,</l>
     <l n="200">By unseen hands on golden tables spread .</l>
     <l n="201">But these the knight accepted like a god ,</l>
     <l n="202">All less was lost in that excess of joy ,</l>
     <l n="203">The crowning marvel of her love for him ,</l>
     <l n="204">Assuring him of his divinity .</l>
     <l n="205">Meanwhile remembrance of the earth appeared</l>
     <l n="206">Like the vague trouble of a transient dream ,—</l>
     <l n="207">The doubt , the scruples , the remorse for thoughts</l>
     <l n="208">Beyond his own control , the constant thirst</l>
     <l n="209">For something fairer than his life , more real</l>
     <l n="210">Than airy revelations of his Muse .</l>
     <l n="211">Here was his soul 's desire satisfied .</l>
     <l n="212">All nobler passions died ; his lyre he flung</l>
     <l n="213">Recklessly forth , with vows to dedicate</l>
     <l n="214">His being to herself . She knew and seized</l>
     <l n="215">The moment of her mastery , and conveyed</l>
     <l n="216">The lyre beyond his sight and memory .</l>
     <l n="217">With blandishment divine she changed for him ,</l>
     <l n="218">Each hour , her mood ; a very woman now ,</l>
     <l n="219">Fantastic , voluble , affectionate ,</l>
     <l n="220">And jealous of the vague , unbodied air ,</l>
     <l n="221">Exacting , penitent , and pacified ,</l>
     <l n="222">All in a breath . And often she appeared</l>
     <l n="223">Majestic with celestial wrath , with eyes</l>
     <l n="224">That shot forth fire , and a heavy brow ,</l>
     <l n="225">Portentous as the lowering front of heaven ,</l>
     <l n="226">When the reverberant , sullen thunder rolls</l>
     <l n="227">Among the echoing clouds . Thus she denounced</l>
     <l n="228">Her ancient , fickle worshippers , who left</l>
     <l n="229">Her altars desecrate , her fires unfed ,</l>
     <l n="230">Her name forgotten . “ But I reign , I reign ! ”</l>
     <l n="231">She would shrill forth , triumphant ; “ yea , I reign .</l>
     <l n="232">Men name me not , but worship me unnamed ,</l>
     <l n="233">Beauty and Love within their heart of hearts ;</l>
     <l n="234">Not with bent knees and empty breath of words ,</l>
     <l n="235">But with devoted sacrifice of lives . ”</l>
     <l n="236">Then melting in a moment , she would weep</l>
     <l n="237">Ambrosial tears , pathetic , full of guile ,</l>
     <l n="238">Accusing her own base ingratitude ,</l>
     <l n="239">In craving worship , when she had his heart ,</l>
     <l n="240">Her priceless knight , her peerless paladin ,</l>
     <l n="241">Her Tannhauser ; then , with an artful glance</l>
     <l n="242">Of lovely helplessness , entreated him</l>
     <l n="243">Not to desert her , like the faithless world ,</l>
     <l n="244">For these unbeautiful and barbarous gods ,</l>
     <l n="245">Or she would never cease her prayers to Jove ,</l>
     <l n="246">Until he took from her the heavy curse</l>
     <l n="247">Of immortality . With closer vows ,</l>
     <l n="248">The knight then sealed his worship and forswore</l>
     <l n="249">All other aims and deeds to serve her cause .</l>
     <l n="250">Thus passed unnoted seven barren years</l>
     <l n="251">Of reckless passion and voluptuous sloth ,</l>
     <l n="252">Undignified by any lofty thought</l>
     <l n="253">In his degraded mind , that sometime was</l>
     <l n="254">Endowed with noble capability .</l>
     <l n="255">From revelry to revelry he passed ,</l>
     <l n="256">Craving more pungent pleasure momently ,</l>
     <l n="257">And new intoxications , and each hour</l>
     <l n="258">The siren goddess answered his desires .</l>
     <l n="259">Once when she left him with a weary sense</l>
     <l n="260">Of utter lassitude , he sat alone ,</l>
     <l n="261">And , raising listless eyes , he saw himself</l>
     <l n="262">In a great burnished mirror , wrought about</l>
     <l n="263">With cunning imagery of twisted vines .</l>
     <l n="264">He scarcely knew those sunken , red-rimmed eyes ,</l>
     <l n="265">For his who in the flush of manhood rode</l>
     <l n="266">Among the cliffs , and followed up the crags</l>
     <l n="267">The flying temptress ; and there fell on him</l>
     <l n="268">A horror of her beauty , a disgust</l>
     <l n="269">For his degenerate and corrupted life ,</l>
     <l n="270">With irresistible , intense desire ,</l>
     <l n="271">To feel the breath of heaven on his face .</l>
     <l n="272">Then as Fate willed , who rules above the gods ,</l>
     <l n="273">He saw , within the glass , behind him glide</l>
     <l n="274">The form of Venus . Certain of her power ,</l>
     <l n="275">She had laid by , in fond security ,</l>
     <l n="276">The enchanted cestus , and Sir Tannhauser ,</l>
     <l n="277">With surfeited regard , beheld her now ,</l>
     <l n="278">No fairer than the women of the earth ,</l>
     <l n="279">Whom with serenity and health he left ,</l>
     <l n="280">Duped by a lovely witch . Before he moved ,</l>
     <l n="281">She knew her destiny ; and when he turned ,</l>
     <l n="282">He seemed to drop a mask , disclosing thus</l>
     <l n="283">An alien face , and eyes with vision true ,</l>
     <l n="284">That for long time with glamour had been blind .</l>
     <l n="285">Hiding the hideous rage within her breast ,</l>
     <l n="286">With girlish simpleness of folded hands ,</l>
     <l n="287">Auroral blushes , and sweet , shamefast mien ,</l>
     <l n="288">She spoke : “ Behold , my love , I have cast forth</l>
     <l n="289">All magic , blandishments and sorcery ,</l>
     <l n="290">For I have dreamed a dream so terrible ,</l>
     <l n="291">That I awoke to find my pillow stained</l>
     <l n="292">With tears as of real woe . I thought my belt ,</l>
     <l n="293">By Vulcan wrought with matchless skill and power ,</l>
     <l n="294">Was the sole bond between us ; this being doffed ,</l>
     <l n="295">I seemed to thee an old , unlovely crone ,</l>
     <l n="296">Wrinkled by every year that I have seen .</l>
     <l n="297">Thou turnedst from me with a brutal sneer ,</l>
     <l n="298">So that I woke with weeping . Then I rose ,</l>
     <l n="299">And drew the glittering girdle from my zone ,</l>
     <l n="300">Jealous thereof , yet full of fears , and said ,</l>
     <l n="301">‘ If it be this he loves , then let him go !</l>
     <l n="302">I have no solace as a mortal hath ,</l>
     <l n="303">No hope of change or death to comfort me</l>
     <l n="304">Through all eternity ; yet he is free ,</l>
     <l n="305">Though I could hold him fast with heavy chains ,</l>
     <l n="306">Bound in perpetual imprisonment . ’</l>
     <l n="307">Tell me my vision was a baseless dream ;</l>
     <l n="308">See , I am kneeling , and kiss thy hands ,—</l>
     <l n="309">In pity , look on me , before thy word</l>
     <l n="310">Condemns me to immortal misery ! ”</l>
     <l n="311">As she looked down , the infernal influence</l>
     <l n="312">Worked on his soul again ; for she was fair</l>
     <l n="313">Beyond imagination , and her brow</l>
     <l n="314">Seemed luminous with high self-sacrifice .</l>
     <l n="315">He bent and kissed her head , warm , shining , soft ,</l>
     <l n="316">With its close-curling gold , and love revived .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>But ere he spoke , he heard the distant sound Of one sweet , smitten lyre , and a gleam Of violent anger flashed across the face Upraised to his in feigned simplicity And singleness of purpose . Then he sprang , Well-nigh a god himself , with sudden strength to vanquish and resist , beyond her reach , Crying , “ My old Muse calls me , and I hear ! Thy fateful vision is no baseless dream ; I will be gone from this accursed hall ! ” Then she , too , rose , dilating over him , And sullen clouds veiled all her rosy limbs , Unto her girdle , and her head appeared Refulgent , and her voice rang wrathfully : “ Have I cajoled and flattered thee till now , To lose thee thus ! How wilt thou make escape ? ONCE BEING MINE THOU ART FOREVER MINE : Yea , not my love , but my poor slave and fool . ” But he , with both hands pressed upon his eyes , Against that blinding lustre , heeded not Her thundered words , and cried in sharp despair , “ Help me , O Virgin Mary ! and thereat , The very bases of the hall gave way , The roof was rived , the goddess disappeared , And Tannhauser stood free upon the cliff , Amidst the morning sunshine and fresh air .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Around him were the tumbled blocks and crags ,</l>
     <l n="2">Huge ridges and sharp juts of flinty peaks ,</l>
     <l n="3">Black caves , and masses of the grim , bald rock .</l>
     <l n="4">The ethereal , unfathomable sky ,</l>
     <l n="5">Hung over him , the valley lay beneath ,</l>
     <l n="6">Dotted with yellow hayricks , that exhaled</l>
     <l n="7">Sweet , healthy odors to the mountain-top .</l>
     <l n="8">He breathed intoxicate the infinite air ,</l>
     <l n="9">And plucked the heather blossoms where they blew ,</l>
     <l n="10">Reckless with light and dew , in crannies green ,</l>
     <l n="11">And scarcely saw their darling bells for tears .</l>
     <l n="12">No sounds of labor reached him from the farms</l>
     <l n="13">And hamlets trim , nor from the furrowed glebe ;</l>
     <l n="14">But a serene and sabbath stillness reigned ,</l>
     <l n="15">Till broken by the faint , melodious chimes</l>
     <l n="16">Of the small village church that called to prayer .</l>
     <l n="17">He hurried down the rugged , scarped cliff ,</l>
     <l n="18">And swung himself from shelving granite slopes</l>
     <l n="19">To narrow foot-holds , near wide-throated chasms ,</l>
     <l n="20">Tearing against the sharp stones his bleeding hands ,</l>
     <l n="21">With long hair flying from his dripping brow ,</l>
     <l n="22">Uncovered head , and white , exalted face .</l>
     <l n="23">No memory had he of his smooth ascent ,</l>
     <l n="24">No thought of fear upon those dreadful hills ;</l>
     <l n="25">He only heard the bell , inviting him</l>
     <l n="26">To satisfy the craving of his heart ,</l>
     <l n="27">For worship ‘ midst his fellow men . He reached</l>
     <l n="28">The beaten , dusty road , and passed thereon</l>
     <l n="29">The pious peasants faring towards the church ,</l>
     <l n="30">And scarce refrained from greeting them like friends</l>
     <l n="31">Dearly beloved , after long absence met .</l>
     <l n="32">How more than fair the sunburnt wenches looked ,</l>
     <l n="33">In their rough , homespun gowns and coifs demure ,</l>
     <l n="34">After the beauty of bare , rosy limbs ,</l>
     <l n="35">And odorous , loose hair ! He noted not</l>
     <l n="36">Suspicious glances on his garb uncouth ,</l>
     <l n="37">His air extravagant and face distraught ,</l>
     <l n="38">With bursts of laughter from the red-cheeked boys ,</l>
     <l n="39">And prudent crossings of the women 's breasts .</l>
     <l n="40">He passed the flowering close about the church ,</l>
     <l n="41">And trod the well worn-path , with throbbing heart ,</l>
     <l n="42">The little heather-bell between his lips ,</l>
     <l n="43">And his eyes fastened on the good green grass .</l>
     <l n="44">Thus entered he the sanctuary , lit</l>
     <l n="45">With frequent tapers , and with sunbeams stained</l>
     <l n="46">Through painted glass . How pure and innocent</l>
     <l n="47">The waiting congregation seemed to him ,</l>
     <l n="48">Kneeling , or seated with calm brows upraised !</l>
     <l n="49">With faltering strength , he cowered down alone ,</l>
     <l n="50">And held sincere communion with the Lord ,</l>
     <l n="51">For one brief moment , in a sudden gush</l>
     <l n="52">Of blessed tears . The minister of God</l>
     <l n="53">Rose to invoke a blessing on his flock ,</l>
     <l n="54">And then began the service ,— not in words</l>
     <l n="55">To raise the lowly , and to heal the sick ,</l>
     <l n="56">But an alien tongue , with phrases formed ,</l>
     <l n="57">And meaningless observances . The knight ,</l>
     <l n="58">Unmoved , yet thirsting for the simple word</l>
     <l n="59">That might have moved him , held his bitter thoughts ,</l>
     <l n="60">But when in his own speech a new priest spake ,</l>
     <l n="61">Looked up with hope revived , and heard the text :</l>
     <l n="62">“ Go , preach the Gospel unto all the world .</l>
     <l n="63">He that believes and is baptized , is saved .</l>
     <l n="64">He that believeth not , is damned in hell ! ”</l>
     <l n="65">He sat with neck thrust forth and staring eyes ;</l>
     <l n="66">The crowded congregation disappeared ;</l>
     <l n="67">He felt alone in some black sea of hell ,</l>
     <l n="68">While a great light smote one exalted face ,</l>
     <l n="69">Vivid already with prophetic fire ,</l>
     <l n="70">Whose fatal mouth now thundered forth his doom .</l>
     <l n="71">He longed in that void circle to cry out ,</l>
     <l n="72">With one clear shriek , but sense and voice seemed bound ,</l>
     <l n="73">And his parched tongue clave useless to his mouth .</l>
     <l n="74">As the last words resounded through the church ,</l>
     <l n="75">And once again the pastor blessed his flock ,</l>
     <l n="76">Who , serious and subdued , passed slowly down</l>
     <l n="77">The arrow aisle , none noted , near the wall ,</l>
     <l n="78">A fallen man with face upon his knees ,</l>
     <l n="79">A heap of huddled garments and loose hair ,</l>
     <l n="80">Unconscious ‘ mid the rustling , murmurous stir ,</l>
     <l n="81">‘ Midst light and rural smell of grass and flowers ,</l>
     <l n="82">Let in athwart the doorway . One lone priest ,</l>
     <l n="83">Darkening the altar lights , moved noiselessly ,</l>
     <l n="84">Now with the yellow glow upon his face ,</l>
     <l n="85">Now a black shadow gliding farther on ,</l>
     <l n="86">Amidst the smooth , slim pillars of hewn ash .</l>
     <l n="87">But from the vacant aisles he heard at once</l>
     <l n="88">A hollow sigh , heaved from a depth profound .</l>
     <l n="89">Upholding his last light above his head ,</l>
     <l n="90">And peering eagerly amidst the stalls ,</l>
     <l n="91">He cried , “ Be blest who cometh in God 's name . ”</l>
     <l n="92">Then the gaunt form of Tannhauser arose .</l>
     <l n="93">“ Father , I am a sinner , and I seek</l>
     <l n="94">Forgiveness and help , by whatso means</l>
     <l n="95">I can regain the joy of peace with God . ”</l>
     <l n="96">“ The Lord hath mercy on the penitent .</l>
     <l n="97">‘ Although thy sins be scarlet , ’ He hath said ,</l>
     <l n="98">‘ Will I not make them white as wool ? ’ Confess ,</l>
     <l n="99">And I will shrive you . ” Thus the good priest moved</l>
     <l n="100">Towards the remorseful knight and pressed his hand .</l>
     <l n="101">But shrinking down , he drew his fingers back</l>
     <l n="102">From the kind palm , and kissed the friar 's feet .</l>
     <l n="103">“ Thy pure hand is anointed , and can heal .</l>
     <l n="104">The cool , calm pressure brings back sanity ,</l>
     <l n="105">And what serene , past joys ! yet touch me not ,</l>
     <l n="106">My contact is pollution ,— hear , O hear ,</l>
     <l n="107">While I disburden my charged soul . ” He lay ,</l>
     <l n="108">Casting about for words and strength to speak .</l>
     <l n="109">“ O father , is there help for such a one , ”</l>
     <l n="110">In tones of deep abasement he began ,</l>
     <l n="111">“ Who hath rebelled against the laws of God ,</l>
     <l n="112">With pride no less presumptuous than his</l>
     <l n="113">Who lost thereby his rank in heaven ? ” “ My son ,</l>
     <l n="114">There is atonement for all sins ,— or slight</l>
     <l n="115">Or difficult , proportioned to the crime .</l>
     <l n="116">Though this may be the staining of thy hands</l>
     <l n="117">With blood of kinsmen or of fellow-men . ”</l>
     <l n="118">“ My hands are white ,— my crime hath found no name ,</l>
     <l n="119">This side of hell ; yet though my heart-strings snap</l>
     <l n="120">To live it over , let me make the attempt .</l>
     <l n="121">I was a knight and bard , with such a gift</l>
     <l n="122">Of revelation that no hour of life</l>
     <l n="123">Lacked beauty and adornment , in myself</l>
     <l n="124">The seat and centre of all happiness .</l>
     <l n="125">What inspiration could my lofty Muse</l>
     <l n="126">Draw from those common and familiar themes ,</l>
     <l n="127">Painted upon the windows and the walls</l>
     <l n="128">Of every church ,— the mother and her child ,</l>
     <l n="129">The miracle and mystery of the birth ,</l>
     <l n="130">The death , the resurrection ? Fool and blind !</l>
     <l n="131">That saw not symbols of eternal truth</l>
     <l n="132">In that grand tragedy and victory ,</l>
     <l n="133">Significant and infinite as life .</l>
     <l n="134">What tortures did my skeptic soul endure ,</l>
     <l n="135">At war against herself and all mankind !</l>
     <l n="136">The restless nights of feverish sleeplessness ,</l>
     <l n="137">With balancing of reasons nicely weighed ;</l>
     <l n="138">The dawn that brought no hope nor energy ,</l>
     <l n="139">The blasphemous arraignment of the Lord ,</l>
     <l n="140">Taxing His glorious divinity</l>
     <l n="141">With all the grief and folly of the world .</l>
     <l n="142">Then came relapses into abject fear ,</l>
     <l n="143">And hollow prayer and praise from craven heart .</l>
     <l n="144">Before a sculptured Venus I would kneel ,</l>
     <l n="145">Crown her with flowers , worship her , and cry ,</l>
     <l n="146">‘ O large and noble type of our ideal ,</l>
     <l n="147">At least my heart and prayer return to thee ,</l>
     <l n="148">Amidst a faithless world of proselytes .</l>
     <l n="149">Madonna Mary , with her virgin lips ,</l>
     <l n="150">And eyes that look perpetual reproach ,</l>
     <l n="151">Insults and is a blasphemy on youth .</l>
     <l n="152">Is she to claim the worship of a man</l>
     <l n="153">Hot with the first rich flush of ripened life ? ’</l>
     <l n="154">Realities , like phantoms , glided by ,</l>
     <l n="155">Unnoted ‘ midst the torment and delights</l>
     <l n="156">Of my conflicting spirit , and I doffed</l>
     <l n="157">the modest Christian weeds of charity</l>
     <l n="158">And fit humility , and steeled myself</l>
     <l n="159">In pagan panoply of stoicism</l>
     <l n="160">And self-sufficing pride . Yet constantly</l>
     <l n="161">I gained men 's charmed attention and applause ,</l>
     <l n="162">With the wild strains I smote from out my lyre ,</l>
     <l n="163">To me the native language of my soul ,</l>
     <l n="164">To them attractive and miraculous ,</l>
     <l n="165">As all things whose solution and whose source</l>
     <l n="166">Remain a mystery . Then came suddenly</l>
     <l n="167">The summons to attend the gathering</l>
     <l n="168">Of minstrels at the Landgrave Hermann 's court .</l>
     <l n="169">Resolved to publish there my pagan creed</l>
     <l n="170">In harmonies so high and beautiful</l>
     <l n="171">That all the world would share my zeal and faith ,</l>
     <l n="172">I journeyed towards the haunted Horsel cliffs .</l>
     <l n="173">O God ! how may I tell you how SHE came ,</l>
     <l n="174">The temptress of a hundred centuries ,</l>
     <l n="175">Yet fresh as April ? She bewitched my sense ,</l>
     <l n="176">Poisoned my judgment with sweet flatteries ,</l>
     <l n="177">And for I may not guess how many years</l>
     <l n="178">Held me a captive in degrading bonds .</l>
     <l n="179">There is no sin of lust so lewd and foul ,</l>
     <l n="180">Which I learned not in that alluring hell ,</l>
     <l n="181">Until this morn , I snapped the ignoble tie ,</l>
     <l n="182">By calling on the Mother of our Lord .</l>
     <l n="183">O for the power to stand again erect ,</l>
     <l n="184">And look men in the eyes ! What penitence ,</l>
     <l n="185">What scourging of the flesh , what rigid fasts ,</l>
     <l n="186">What terrible privations may suffice</l>
     <l n="187">To cleanse me in the sight of God and man ? ”</l>
     <l n="188">Ill-omened silence followed his appeal .</l>
     <l n="189">Patient and motionless he lay awhile ,</l>
     <l n="190">Then sprang unto his feet with sudden force ,</l>
     <l n="191">Confronting in his breathless vehemence ,</l>
     <l n="192">With palpitating heart , the timid priest .</l>
     <l n="193">“ Answer me , as you hope for a response ,</l>
     <l n="194">One day , at the great judgment seat yourself . ”</l>
     <l n="195">“ I cannot answer , ” said the timid priest ,</l>
     <l n="196">“ I have not understood . ” “ Just God ! is this</l>
     <l n="197">The curse Thou layest upon me ? I outstrip</l>
     <l n="198">The sympathy and brotherhood of men ,</l>
     <l n="199">So far removed is my experience</l>
     <l n="200">From their clean innocence . Inspire me ,</l>
     <l n="201">Prompt me to words that bring me near to them !</l>
     <l n="202">Father , ” in gentler accents he resumed ,</l>
     <l n="203">“ Thank Heaven at your every orison</l>
     <l n="204">That sin like mine you cannot apprehend .</l>
     <l n="205">More than the truth perchance I have confessed ,</l>
     <l n="206">But I have sinned , and darkly ,— this is true ;</l>
     <l n="207">And I have suffered , and am suffering now .</l>
     <l n="208">Is there no help in your great Christian creed</l>
     <l n="209">Of liberal charity , for such a one ? ”</l>
     <l n="210">“ My son , ” the priest replied , “ your speech distraught</l>
     <l n="211">Hath quite bewildered me . I fain would hope</l>
     <l n="212">That Christ 's large charity can reach your sin ,</l>
     <l n="213">But I know naught . I cannot but believe</l>
     <l n="214">That the enchantress who first tempted you</l>
     <l n="215">Must be the Evil one ,— your early doubt</l>
     <l n="216">Was the possession of your soul by him .</l>
     <l n="217">Travel across the mountain to the town ,</l>
     <l n="218">The first cathedral town upon the road</l>
     <l n="219">That leads to Rome ,— a sage and reverend priest ,</l>
     <l n="220">The Bishop Adrian , bides there . Say you have come</l>
     <l n="221">From his leal servant , Friar Lodovick ;</l>
     <l n="222">He hath vast lore and great authority ,</l>
     <l n="223">And may absolve you freely of your sin . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="224">Over the rolling hills , through summer fields ,</l>
     <l n="225">By noisy villages and lonely lanes ,</l>
     <l n="226">Through glowing days , when all the landscape stretched</l>
     <l n="227">Shimmering in the heat , a pilgrim fared</l>
     <l n="228">Towards the cathedral town . Sir Tannhauser</l>
     <l n="229">Had donned the mournful sackcloth , girt his loins</l>
     <l n="230">With a coarse rope that ate into his flesh ,</l>
     <l n="231">Muffled a cowl about his shaven head ,</l>
     <l n="232">Hung a great leaden cross around his neck ;</l>
     <l n="233">And bearing in his hands a knotty staff ,</l>
     <l n="234">With swollen , sandaled feet he held his course .</l>
     <l n="235">He snatched scant rest at twilight or at dawn ,</l>
     <l n="236">When his forced travel was least difficult .</l>
     <l n="237">But most he journeyed when the sky , o'ercast ,</l>
     <l n="238">Uprolled its threatening clouds of dusky blue ,</l>
     <l n="239">And angry thunder grumbled through the hills ,</l>
     <l n="240">And earth grew dark at noonday , till the flash</l>
     <l n="241">Of the thin lightning through the wide sky leapt .</l>
     <l n="242">And tumbling showers scoured along the plain .</l>
     <l n="243">Then folk who saw the pilgrim penitent ,</l>
     <l n="244">Drenched , weird , and hastening as as to some strange doom ,</l>
     <l n="245">Swore that the wandering Jew had crossed their land ,</l>
     <l n="246">And the Lord Christ had sent the deadly bolt</l>
     <l n="247">Harmless upon his cursed , immortal head .</l>
     <l n="248">At length the hill-side city 's spires and roofs ,</l>
     <l n="249">With all its western windows smitten red</l>
     <l n="250">By a rich sunset , and with massive towers</l>
     <l n="251">Of its cathedral overtopping all ,</l>
     <l n="252">greeted his sight . Some weary paces more ,</l>
     <l n="253">And as the twilight deepened in the streets ,</l>
     <l n="254">He stood within the minster . How serene ,</l>
     <l n="255">In sculptured calm of centuries , it seemed !</l>
     <l n="256">How cool and spacious all the dim-lit aisles ,</l>
     <l n="257">Still hazy with fumes of frankincense !</l>
     <l n="258">The vesper had been said , yet here and there</l>
     <l n="259">A wrinkled beldam , or mourner veiled ,</l>
     <l n="260">Or burly burgher on the cold floor knelt ,</l>
     <l n="261">And still the organist , with wandering hands ,</l>
     <l n="262">Drew from the keys mysterious melodies ,</l>
     <l n="263">And filled the church with flying waifs of song ,</l>
     <l n="264">That with ethereal beauty moved the soul</l>
     <l n="265">To a more tender prayer and gentler faith</l>
     <l n="266">Than choral anthems and the solemn mass .</l>
     <l n="267">A thousand memories , sweet to bitterness ,</l>
     <l n="268">Rushed on the knight and filled his eyes with tears ;</l>
     <l n="269">Youth 's blamelessness and faith forever lost ,</l>
     <l n="270">The love of his neglected lyre , his art ,</l>
     <l n="271">Revived by these aerial harmonies .</l>
     <l n="272">He was unworthy now to touch the strings ,</l>
     <l n="273">Too base to stir men 's soul to ecstasy</l>
     <l n="274">And high resolves , as in the days agone ;</l>
     <l n="275">And yet , with all his spirit 's earnestness ,</l>
     <l n="276">He yearned to feel the lyre between his hands ,</l>
     <l n="277">To utter all the trouble of his life</l>
     <l n="278">Unto the Muse who understands and helps .</l>
     <l n="279">Outworn with travel , soothed to drowsiness</l>
     <l n="280">By dying music and sweet-scented air ,</l>
     <l n="281">His limbs relaxed , and sleep possessed his frame .</l>
     <l n="282">Auroral light the eastern oriels touched ,</l>
     <l n="283">When with delicious sense of rest he woke ,</l>
     <l n="284">Amidst the cast and silent empty aisles .</l>
     <l n="285">“ God 's peace hath fallen upon me in this place ;</l>
     <l n="286">This is my Bethel ; here I feel again</l>
     <l n="287">A holy calm , if not of innocence ,</l>
     <l n="288">Yet purest after that , the calm serene</l>
     <l n="289">Of expiation and forgiveness . ”</l>
     <l n="290">He spake , and passed with staff and wallet forth</l>
     <l n="291">Through the tall portal to the open square ,</l>
     <l n="292">And turning , paused to look upon the pile .</l>
     <l n="293">The northern front against the crystal sky</l>
     <l n="294">Loomed dark and heavy , full of sombre shade ,</l>
     <l n="295">With each projecting buttress , carven cross ,</l>
     <l n="296">Gable and mullion , tipped with laughing light</l>
     <l n="297">By the slant sunbeams of the risen morn .</l>
     <l n="298">The noisy swallows wheeled above their nests ,</l>
     <l n="299">Builded in hidden nooks about the porch .</l>
     <l n="300">No human life was stirring in the square ,</l>
     <l n="301">Save now and then a rumbling market-team ,</l>
     <l n="302">Fresh from the fields and farms without the town .</l>
     <l n="303">He knelt upon the broad cathedral steps ,</l>
     <l n="304">And kissed the moistened stone , while overhead</l>
     <l n="305">The circling swallows sang , and all around</l>
     <l n="306">The mighty city lay asleep and still .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="307">To stranger 's ears must yet again be made</l>
     <l n="308">The terrible confession ; yet again</l>
     <l n="309">A deathly chill , with something worse than fear ,</l>
     <l n="310">Seized the knight 's heart , who knew his every word</l>
     <l n="311">Widened the gulf between his kind and him .</l>
     <l n="312">The Bishop sat with pomp of mitred head ,</l>
     <l n="313">In pride of proven virtue , hearkening to all</l>
     <l n="314">With cold , official apathy , nor made</l>
     <l n="315">A sign of pity nor encouragement .</l>
     <l n="316">The friar understood the pilgrim 's grief ,</l>
     <l n="317">The language of his eyes ; his speech alone</l>
     <l n="318">Was alien to these kind , untutored ears .</l>
     <l n="319">But this was truly to be misconstrued ,</l>
     <l n="320">To tear each palpitating word alive</l>

     <l n="323">And the nice logic of a reasoning mind .</l>
     <l n="324">This spiritual Father judged his crime</l>
     <l n="325">As the mad mischief of a reckless boy ,</l>
     <l n="326">That call for strict , immediate punishment .</l>
     <l n="327">But Tannhauser , who felt himself a man ,</l>
     <l n="328">Though base , yet fallen through passions and rare gifts</l>
     <l n="329">Of an exuberant nature rankly rich ,</l>
     <l n="330">And knew his weary head was growing gray</l>
     <l n="331">With a life 's terrible experience ,</l>
     <l n="332">Found his old sense of proper worth revive ;</l>
     <l n="333">But modestly he ended : “ Yet I felt ,</l>
     <l n="334">O holy Father , in the church , this morn ,</l>
     <l n="335">A strange security , a peace serene ,</l>
     <l n="336">As though e'en yet the Lord regarded me</l>
     <l n="337">With merciful compassion ; yea , as though</l>
     <l n="338">Even so vile a worm as I might work</l>
     <l n="339">Mine own salvation , through repentant prayers . ”</l>
     <l n="340">“ Presumptuous man , it is no easy task</l>
     <l n="341">To expiate such sin ; a space of prayer</l>
     <l n="342">That deprecates the anger of the Lord ,</l>
     <l n="343">A pilgrimage through pleasant summer lands ,</l>
     <l n="344">May not atone for years of impious lust ;</l>
     <l n="345">Thy heart hath lied to thee in offering hope . ”</l>
     <l n="346">“ Is there no hope on earth ? ” the pilgrim sighed .</l>
     <l n="347">“ None through thy penance , ” said the saintly man .</l>
     <l n="348">“ Yet there may be through mediation , help .</l>
     <l n="349">There is a man who by a blameless life</l>
     <l n="350">Hath won the right to intercede with God .</l>
     <l n="351">No sins of his own flesh hath he to purge ,—</l>
     <l n="352">The Cardinal Filippo ,— he abides ,</l>
     <l n="353">Within the Holy City . Seek him out ;</l>
     <l n="354">This is my only counsel ,— through thyself</l>
     <l n="355">Can be no help and no forgiveness . ”</l>

   <p>How different from the buoyant joy of morn Was this discouraged sense of lassitude , The Bishop 's words were ringing in his ears , Measured and pitiless , and blent with these , The memory of the goddess ’ last wild cry ,— “ ONCE BEING MINE , THOU ART FOREVER MINE . ” Was it the truth , despite his penitence , And the dedication of his thought to God , That still some portion of himself was hers , Some lust survived , some criminal regret , For her corrupted love ? He searched his heart : All was remorse , religious and sincere , And yet her dreadful curse still haunted him ; For all men shunned him , and denied him help , Knowing at once in looking on his face , Ploughed with deep lines and prematurely old , That he had struggled with some deadly fiend , And that he was no longer kin to them . Just past the outskirts of the town , he stopped , To strengthen will and courage to proceed . The storm had broken o'er the sultry streets , But now the lessening clouds were flying east , And though the gentle shower still wet his face , The west was cloudless while the sun went down , And the bright seven-colored arch stood forth , Against the opposite dull gray . There was A beauty in the mingled storm and peace , Beyond clear sunshine , as the vast , green fields Basked in soft light , though glistening yet with rain . The roar of all the town was now a buzz Less than the insects ’ drowsy murmuring That whirred their gauzy wings around his head . The breeze that follows on the sunsetting Was blowing whiffs of bruised and dripping grass Into the heated city . But he stood , Disconsolate with thoughts of fate and sin , Still wrestling with his soul to win it back From her who claimed it to eternity . Then on the delicate air there came to him The intonation of the minster bells , Chiming the vespers , musical and faint . He knew not what of dear and beautiful There was in those familiar peals , that spake Of his first boyhood and his innocence , Leading him back , with gracious influence , To pleasant thoughts and tender memories , And last , recalling the fair hour of hope He passed that morning in the church . Again , The glad assurance of God 's boundless love Filled all his being , and he rose serene , And journeyed forward with a calm content .</p>

     <l n="12">Veiled in gray mist of olive groves . No more</l>
     <l n="13">He passed dark , moated strongholds of grim knights ,</l>
     <l n="14">But terraces with marble-paven steps ,</l>
     <l n="15">With fountains leaping in the sunny air ,</l>
     <l n="16">And hanging gardens full of sumptuous bloom .</l>
     <l n="17">Then cloisters guarded by their dead gray walls ,</l>
     <l n="18">Where now and then a golden globe of fruit</l>
     <l n="19">Or full-flushed flower peered out upon the road ,</l>
     <l n="20">Nodding against the stone , and where he heard</l>
     <l n="21">Sometimes the voices of the chanting monks ,</l>
     <l n="22">Sometimes the laugh of children at their play ,</l>
     <l n="23">Amidst the quaint , old gardens . But these sights</l>
     <l n="24">Were in the suburbs of the wealthy towns .</l>
     <l n="25">For many a day through wildernesses rank ,</l>
     <l n="26">Or marshy , feverous meadow-lands he fared ,</l>
     <l n="27">The fierce sun smiting his close-muffled head ;</l>
     <l n="28">Or ‘ midst the Alpine gorges faced the storm ,</l>
     <l n="29">That drave adown the gullies melted snow</l>
     <l n="30">And clattering boulders from the mountain-tops .</l>
     <l n="31">At times , between the mountains and the sea</l>
     <l n="32">Fair prospects opened , with the boundless stretch</l>
     <l n="33">Of restless , tideless water by his side ,</l>
     <l n="34">And their long wash upon the yellow sand .</l>
     <l n="35">Beneath this generous sky the country-folk</l>
     <l n="36">Could lead a freer life ,— the fat , green fields</l>
     <l n="37">Offered rich pasturage , athwart the air</l>
     <l n="38">Rang tinkling cow-bells and the shepherds ’ pipes .</l>
     <l n="39">The knight met many a strolling troubadour ,</l>
     <l n="40">Bearing his cithern , flute , or dulcimer ;</l>
     <l n="41">And oft beneath some castle 's balcony ,</l>
     <l n="42">At night , he heard their mellow voices rise ,</l>
     <l n="43">Blent with stringed instruments or tambourines ,</l>
     <l n="44">Chanting some lay as natural as a bird 's .</l>
     <l n="45">Then Nature stole with healthy influence</l>
     <l n="46">Into his thoughts ; his love of beauty woke ,</l>
     <l n="47">His Muse inspired dreams as in the past .</l>
     <l n="48">But after this came crueler remorse ,</l>
     <l n="49">And he would tighten round his loins the rope ,</l>
     <l n="50">And lie for hours beside some wayside cross ,</l>
     <l n="51">And feel himself unworthy to enjoy</l>
     <l n="52">The splendid gift and privilege of life .</l>
     <l n="53">Then forth he hurried , spurred by his desire</l>
     <l n="54">To reach the City of the Seven Hills ,</l>
     <l n="55">And gain his absolution . Some leagues more</l>
     <l n="56">Would bring him to the vast Campagna land ,</l>
     <l n="57">When by a roadside well he paused to rest .</l>
     <l n="58">‘ T was noon , and reapers in the field hard by</l>
     <l n="59">Lay neath the trees upon the sun-scorched grass .</l>
     <l n="60">But from their midst one came towards the well ,</l>
     <l n="61">Not trudging like a man forespent with toil ,</l>
     <l n="62">But frisking like a child at holiday ,</l>
     <l n="63">With light steps . The pilgrim watched him come ,</l>
     <l n="64">And found him scarcely older than a child ,</l>
     <l n="65">A large-mouthed earthen pitcher in his hand ,</l>
     <l n="66">And a guitar upon his shoulder slung .</l>
     <l n="67">A wide straw hat threw all his face in shade ,</l>
     <l n="68">But doffing this , to catch whatever breeze</l>
     <l n="69">Might stir among the branches , he disclosed</l>
     <l n="70">A charming head of rippled , auburn hair ,</l>
     <l n="71">A frank , fair face , as lovely as a girls ,</l>
     <l n="72">With great , soft eyes , as mild and grave as kine 's .</l>
     <l n="73">Above his head he slipped the instrument ,</l>
     <l n="74">And laid it with his hat upon the turf ,</l>
     <l n="75">Lowered his pitcher down the well-head cool ,</l>
     <l n="76">And drew it dripping upward , ere he saw</l>
     <l n="77">The watchful pilgrim , craving ( as he thought )</l>
     <l n="78">The precious draught . “ Your pardon , holy sir ,</l>
     <l n="79">Drink first , ” he cried , “ before I take the jar</l>
     <l n="80">Unto my father in the reaping-field . ”</l>
     <l n="81">Touched by the cordial kindness of the lad ,</l>
     <l n="82">The pilgrim answered ,— “ Thanks , my thirst is quenched</l>
     <l n="83">From mine own palm . ” The stranger deftly poised</l>
     <l n="84">The brimming pitcher on his head , and turned</l>
     <l n="85">Back to the reaping-folk , while Tannhauser</l>
     <l n="86">Looked after him across the sunny fields ,</l>
     <l n="87">Clasping each hand about his waist to bear</l>
     <l n="88">The balanced pitcher ; then , down glancing , found</l>
     <l n="89">The lad 's guitar near by , and fell at once</l>
     <l n="90">To striking its tuned string with wandering hands ,</l>
     <l n="91">And pensive eyes filled full of tender dreams .</l>
     <l n="92">“ Yea , holy sir , it is a worthless thing ,</l>
     <l n="93">And yet I love it , for I make it speak . ”</l>
     <l n="94">The boy again stood by him and dispelled</l>
     <l n="95">His train of fantasies half sweet , half sad .</l>
     <l n="96">“ That was not in my thought , ” the knight replied .</l>
     <l n="97">“ Its worth is more than rubies ; whoso hath</l>
     <l n="98">The art to make this speak is raised thereby</l>
     <l n="99">Above all loneliness or grief or fear . ”</l>
     <l n="100">More to himself than to the lad he spake ,</l>
     <l n="101">Who , understanding not , stood doubtfully</l>
     <l n="102">At a loss for answer ; but the knight went on :</l>
     <l n="103">“ How came it in your hands , and who hath tuned</l>
     <l n="104">your voice to follow it . ” “ I am unskilled ,</l>
     <l n="105">Good father , but my mother smote its strings</l>
     <l n="106">To music rare . ” Diverted from one theme ,</l>
     <l n="107">Pleased with the winsome candor of the boy ,</l>
     <l n="108">The knight encouraged him to confidence ;</l>
     <l n="109">Then his own gift of minstrelsy revealed ,</l>
     <l n="110">And told bright tales of his first wanderings ,</l>
     <l n="111">When in lords ’ castles and kings ’ palaces</l>
     <l n="112">Men still made place for him , for in his land</l>
     <l n="113">The gift was rare and valued at its worth ,</l>
     <l n="114">And brought great victory and sounding fame .</l>
     <l n="115">Thus , in retracing all his pleasant youth ,</l>
     <l n="116">His suffering passed as though it had not been .</l>
     <l n="117">Wide-eyed and open-mouthed the boy gave ear ,</l>
     <l n="118">His fair face flushing with the sudden thoughts</l>
     <l n="119">That went and came ,— then , as the pilgrim ceased ,</l>
     <l n="120">Drew breath and spake : “ And where now is your lyre ? ”</l>
     <l n="121">The knight with both hands hid his changed , white face ,</l>
     <l n="122">Crying aloud , “ Lost ! lost ! forever lost ! ”</l>
     <l n="123">Then , gathering strength , he bared his face again</l>
     <l n="124">Unto the frightened , wondering boy , and rose</l>
     <l n="125">With hasty fear . “ Ah , child , you bring me back</l>
     <l n="126">Unwitting to remembrance of my grief ,</l>
     <l n="127">For which I donned eternal garb of woe ;</l>
     <l n="128">And yet I owe you thanks for one sweet hour</l>
     <l n="129">Of healthy human intercourse and peace .</l>
     <l n="130">‘ T is not for me to tarry by the way .</l>
     <l n="131">Farewell ! ” The impetuous , remorseful boy ,</l>
     <l n="132">Seeing sharp pain on that kind countenance ,</l>
     <l n="133">Fell at his feet and cried , “ Forgive my words ,</l>
     <l n="134">Witless but innocent , and leave me not</l>
     <l n="135">Without a blessing . ” Moved unutterably ,</l>
     <l n="136">The pilgrim kissed with trembling lips his head ,</l>
     <l n="137">And muttered , “ At this moment would to God</l>
     <l n="138">That I were worthy ! ” Then waved wasted hands</l>
     <l n="139">Over the youth in act of blessing him ,</l>
     <l n="140">But faltered , “ Cleanse me through his innocence ,</l>
     <l n="141">O heavenly Father ! ” and with quickening steps</l>
     <l n="142">Hastened away upon the road to Rome .</l>
     <l n="143">The noon was past , the reapers drew broad swaths</l>
     <l n="144">With scythes sun-smitten ‘ midst the ripened crop .</l>
     <l n="145">Thin shadows of the afternoon slept soft</l>
     <l n="146">On the green meadows as the knight passed forth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="147">He trudged amidst the sea of poisonous flowers</l>
     <l n="148">On the Campagna 's undulating plain ,</l>
     <l n="149">With Rome , the many-steepled , many-towered ,</l>
     <l n="150">Before him regnant on her throne of hills .</l>
     <l n="151">A thick blue cloud of haze o'erhung the town ,</l>
     <l n="152">But the fast-sinking sun struck fiery light</l>
     <l n="153">From shining crosses , roofs , and flashing domes .</l>
     <l n="154">Across his path an arching bridge of stone</l>
     <l n="155">Was raised above a shrunken yellow stream ,</l>
     <l n="156">Hurrying with the light on every wave</l>
     <l n="157">Towards the great town and outward to the sea .</l>
     <l n="158">Upon the bridge 's crest he paused , and leaned</l>
     <l n="159">Against the barrier , throwing back his cowl ,</l>
     <l n="160">And gazed upon the dull , unlovely flood</l>
     <l n="161">That was the Tiber . Quaggy banks lay bare ,</l>
     <l n="162">Muddy and miry , glittering in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="163">And myriad insects hovered o'er the reeds ,</l>
     <l n="164">Whose lithe , moist tips by listless airs were stirred .</l>
     <l n="165">When the low sun had dropped behind the hills ,</l>
     <l n="166">He found himself within the streets of Rome ,</l>
     <l n="167">Walking as in a sleep , where naught seemed real .</l>
     <l n="168">The chattering hubbub of the market-place</l>
     <l n="169">Was over now ; but voices smote his ear</l>
     <l n="170">Of garrulous citizens who jostled past .</l>
     <l n="171">Loud cries , gay laughter , snatches of sweet song ,</l>
     <l n="172">The tinkling fountains set in gardens cool</l>
     <l n="173">About the pillared palaces , and blent</l>
     <l n="174">With trickling of the conduits in the squares ,</l>
     <l n="175">The noisy teams within the narrow streets ,—</l>
     <l n="176">All these the stranger heard and did not hear ,</l>
     <l n="177">While ringing bells pealed out above the town ,</l>
     <l n="178">And calm gray twilight skies stretched over it .</l>
     <l n="179">Wide open stood the doors of every church ,</l>
     <l n="180">And through the porches pressed a streaming throng .</l>
     <l n="181">Vague wonderment perplexed him , at the sight</l>
     <l n="182">Of broken columns raised to Jupiter</l>
     <l n="183">Beside the cross , immense cathedrals reared</l>
     <l n="184">Upon a dead faith 's ruins ; all the whirl</l>
     <l n="185">And eager bustle of the living town</l>
     <l n="186">Filling the storied streets , whose very stones</l>
     <l n="187">Were solemn monuments , and spake of death .</l>
     <l n="188">Although he wrestled with himself , the thought</l>
     <l n="189">Of that poor , past religion smote his heart</l>
     <l n="190">With a huge pity and deep sympathy ,</l>
     <l n="191">Beyond the fervor which the Church inspired .</l>
     <l n="192">Where was the noble race who ruled the world ,</l>
     <l n="193">Moulded of purest elements , and stuffed</l>
     <l n="194">With sternest virtues , every man a king ,</l>
     <l n="195">Wearing the purple native in his heart ?</l>
     <l n="196">These lounging beggars , stealthy monks and priests ,</l>
     <l n="197">And womanish patricians filled their place .</l>
     <l n="198">Thus Tannhauser , still half an infidel ,</l>
     <l n="199">Pagan through mind and Christian through the heart ,</l>
     <l n="200">Fared thoughtfully with wandering , aimless steps ,</l>
     <l n="201">Till in the dying glimmer of the day</l>
     <l n="202">He raised his eyes and found himself alone</l>
     <l n="203">Amid the ruined arches , broken shafts ,</l>
     <l n="204">And huge arena of the Coliseum .</l>
     <l n="205">He did not see it as it was , dim-lit</l>
     <l n="206">By something less than day and more than night ,</l>
     <l n="207">With wan reflections of the rising moon</l>
     <l n="208">Rather divined than seen on ivied walls ,</l>
     <l n="209">And crumbled battlements , and topless columns —</l>
     <l n="210">But by the light of all the ancient days ,</l>
     <l n="211">Ringed with keen eager faces , living eyes ,</l>
     <l n="212">Fixed on the circus with a savage joy ,</l>
     <l n="213">Where brandished swords flashed white , and human blood</l>
     <l n="214">Streamed o'er the thirsty dust , and Death was king .</l>
     <l n="215">He started , shuddering , and drew breath to see</l>
     <l n="216">The foul pit choked with weeds and tumbled stones ,</l>
     <l n="217">The cross raised midmost , and the peaceful moon</l>
     <l n="218">Shining o'er all ; and fell upon his knees ,</l>
     <l n="219">Restored to faith in one wise , loving God .</l>
     <l n="220">Day followed day , and still he bode in Rome ,</l>
     <l n="221">Waiting his audience with the Cardinal ,</l>
     <l n="222">And from the gates , on pretext frivolous ,</l>
     <l n="223">Passed daily forth ,— his Eminency slept ,—</l>
     <l n="224">Again , his Eminency was fatigued</l>
     <l n="225">By tedious sessions of the Papal court ,</l>
     <l n="226">And thus the patient pilgrim was referred</l>
     <l n="227">Unto a later hour . At last the page</l>
     <l n="228">Bore him a missive with Filippo 's seal ,</l>
     <l n="229">That in his name commended Tannhauser</l>
     <l n="230">Unto the Pope . The worn , discouraged knight</l>
     <l n="231">Read the brief scroll , then sadly forth again ,</l>
     <l n="232">Along the bosky alleys of the park ,</l>
     <l n="233">Passed to the glare and noise of summer streets .</l>
     <l n="234">“ Good God ! ” he muttered , “ Thou hast ears for all ,</l>
     <l n="235">And sendest help and comfort ; yet these men ,</l>
     <l n="236">Thy saintly ministers , must deck themselves</l>
     <l n="237">With arrogance , and from their large delight</l>
     <l n="238">In all the beauty of the beauteous earth ,</l>
     <l n="239">And peace of indolent , untempted souls ,</l>
     <l n="240">Deny the hungry outcast a bare word . ”</l>
     <l n="241">Yet even as he nourished bitter thoughts ,</l>
     <l n="242">He felt a depth of clear serenity ,</l>
     <l n="243">Unruffled in his heart beneath it all .</l>
     <l n="244">No outward object now had farther power</l>
     <l n="245">To wound him there , for the brooding o'er those deeps</l>
     <l n="246">Of vast contrition was boundless hope .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Yet not to leave a human chance untried , He sought the absolution of the Pope . In a great hall with airy galleries , Thronged with high dignitaries of the Church , He took his seat amidst the humblest friars . Through open windows came sweet garden smells , Bright morning light , and twittered song of birds . Around the hall flashed gold and sunlit gems , And splendid wealth of color ,— white-stoled priests , And scarlet cardinals , and bishops clad In violet vestments ,— while beneath the shade Of the high gallery huddled dusky shapes , With faded , travel-tattered , sombre smocks , And shaven heads , and girdles of coarse hemp ; Some , pilgrims penitent like Tannhauser ; Some , devotees to kiss the sacred feet . The brassy blare of trumpets smote the air , Shrill pipes and horns with swelling clamor came , And through the doorway 's wide-stretched tapestries Passed the Pope 's trumpeters and mace-bearers , His vergers bearing slender silver wands , Then mitred bishops , red-clad cardinals , The stalwart Papal Guard with halberds raised , And then , with white head crowned with gold ingemmed , The vicar of the lowly Galilean , Holding his pastoral rod of smooth-hewn wood , With censer swung before and peacock fans Waved constantly by pages , either side . Attended thus , they bore him to his throne , And priests and laymen fell upon their knees . Then , after pause of brief and silent prayer , The pilgrims singly through the hall defiled , To kiss the borders of the papal skirts , Smiting their foreheads on the paven stone ; Some silent , abject , some accusing them Of venial sins in accents of remorse , Craving his grace , and passing pardoned forth . Sir Tannhauser came last , no need for him To cry “ Peccavi , ” and crook suppliant knees . His gray head rather crushed than bowed , his face Livid and wasted , his deep thoughtful eyes , His tall gaunt form in those unseemly weeds , Spake more than eloquence . His hollow voice Brake silence , saying , “ I am Tannhauser . For seven years I lived apart from men , Within the Venusberg . ” A horror seized The assembled folk ; some turbulently rose ; Some clamored , “ From the presence cast him forth ! ” But the knight never ceased his steady gaze Upon the Pope . At last ,— “ I have not spoken To be condemned , ” he said , “ by such as these . Thou , spiritual Father , answer me . Look thou upon me with the eyes of Christ . Can I through expiation gain my shrift , And work mine own redemption ? ” “ Insolent man ! ” Thundered the outraged Pope , “ is this the tone Wherewith thou dost parade thy loathsome sin ? Down on thy knees , and wallow on the earth ! Nay , rather go ! there is no ray of hope , No gleam , through cycles of eternity , For the redemption of a soul like thine . Yea , sooner shall my pastoral rod branch forth In leaf and blossom , and green shoots of spring , Than Christ will pardon thee . ” And as he spoke , He struck the rod upon the floor with force That gave it entrance ‘ twixt two loosened tiles , So that it stood , fast-rooted and alone . The knight saw naught , he only heard his judge Ring forth his curses , and the court cry out “ Anathema ! ” and loud , and blent therewith , Derisive laughter in the very hall , And a wild voice that thrilled through flesh and heart : “ ONCE BEING MINE , THOU ART FOREVER MINE ! ” Half-mad he clasped both hands upon his brow , Amidst the storm of voices , till they died , And all was silence , save the reckless song Of a young bird upon a twig without . Then a defiant , ghastly face he raised , And shrieked , “ ‘ T is false ! I am no longer thine ! ” And through the windows open to the park , Rushed forth , beyond the sight and sound of men .</p>

     <l n="1">By church nor palace paused he , till he passed</l>
     <l n="2">All squares and streets , and crossed the bridge of stone ,</l>
     <l n="3">And stood alone amidst the broad expanse</l>
     <l n="4">Of the Campagna , twinkling in the heat .</l>
     <l n="5">He knelt upon a knoll of turf , and snapped</l>
     <l n="6">The cord that held the cross about his neck ,</l>
     <l n="7">And far from him the leaden burden flung .</l>
     <l n="8">“ O God ! I thank Thee , that my faith in Thee</l>
     <l n="9">Subsists at last , through all discouragements .</l>
     <l n="10">Between us must no type nor symbol stand ,</l>

     <l n="15">Between my nothingness and thy high heavens —</l>

     <l n="17">Cleanse me from lust and bitterness and pride ,</l>
     <l n="18">Have mercy in accordance with my faith . ”</l>
     <l n="19">Long time he lay upon the scorching grass ,</l>
     <l n="20">With his face buried in the tangled weeds .</l>
     <l n="21">Ah ! who can tell the struggles of his soul</l>
     <l n="22">Against its demons in that sacred hour ,</l>
     <l n="23">The solitude , the anguish , the remorse ?</l>
     <l n="24">When shadows long and thin lay on the ground ,</l>
     <l n="25">Shivering with fever , helpless he arose ,</l>
     <l n="26">But with a face divine , ineffable ,</l>
     <l n="27">Such as we dream the face of Israel ,</l>
     <l n="28">When the Lord 's wrestling angel , at gray dawn ,</l>
     <l n="29">Blessed him , and disappeared .</l>
     <l n="30">Upon the marsh ,</l>
     <l n="31">All night , he wandered , striving to emerge</l>
     <l n="32">From the wild , pathless plain ,— now limitless</l>
     <l n="33">And colorless beneath the risen moon ;</l>
     <l n="34">Outstretching like a sea , with landmarks none ,</l>
     <l n="35">Save broken aqueducts and parapets ,</l>
     <l n="36">And ruined columns glinting ‘ neath the moon .</l>
     <l n="37">His dress was dank and clinging with the dew ;</l>
     <l n="38">A thousand insects fluttered o'er his head ,</l>
     <l n="39">With buzz and drone ; unseen cicadas chirped</l>
     <l n="40">Among the long , rank grass , and far and near</l>
     <l n="41">The fire-flies flickered through the summer air .</l>
     <l n="42">Vague thoughts and gleams prophetic filled his brain .</l>
     <l n="43">“ Ah , fool ! ” he mused , “ to look for help from men .</l>
     <l n="44">Had they the will to aid , they lack the power .</l>
     <l n="45">In mine own flesh and soul the sin had birth ,</l>
     <l n="46">Through mine own anguish it must be atoned .</l>
     <l n="47">Our saviours are not saints and ministers ,</l>
     <l n="48">But tear-strung women , children soft of heart ,</l>
     <l n="49">Or fellow-sufferers , who , by some chance word ,</l>
     <l n="50">Some glance of comfort , save us from despair .</l>
     <l n="51">These I have found , thank heaven ! to strengthen trust</l>
     <l n="52">In mine own kind , when all the world grew dark .</l>
     <l n="53">Make me not proud in spirit , O my God !</l>
     <l n="54">Yea , in thy sight I am one mass of sin ,</l>
     <l n="55">One black and foul corruption , yet I know</l>
     <l n="56">My frailty is exceeded by thy love .</l>
     <l n="57">Neither is this the slender straw of hope ,</l>
     <l n="58">Whereto I , drowning , cling , but firm belief ,</l>
     <l n="59">That fills my inmost soul with vast content .</l>
     <l n="60">As surely as the hollow faiths of old</l>
     <l n="61">Shriveled to dust before one ray of Truth ,</l>
     <l n="62">So will these modern temples pass away ,</l>
     <l n="63">Piled upon rotten doctrines , baseless forms ,</l>
     <l n="64">And man will look in his own breast for help ,</l>
     <l n="65">Yea , search for comfort his own inward reins ,</l>
     <l n="66">Revere himself , and find the God within .</l>
     <l n="67">Patience and patience ! ” Through the sleepless night</l>
     <l n="68">He held such thoughts ; at times before his eyes</l>
     <l n="69">Flashed glimpses of the Church that was to be ,</l>
     <l n="70">Sublimely simple in the light serene</l>
     <l n="71">Of future ages ; then the vision changed</l>
     <l n="72">To the Pope 's hall , thronged with high priests , who hurled</l>
     <l n="73">Their curses on him . Staggering , he awoke</l>
     <l n="74">Unto the truth , and found himself alone ,</l>
     <l n="75">Beneath the awful stars . When dawn 's first chill</l>
     <l n="76">Crept though the shivering grass and heavy leaves ,</l>
     <l n="77">Giddy and overcome , he fell and slept</l>
     <l n="78">Upon the dripping weeds , nor dreamed nor stirred ,</l>
     <l n="79">Until the wide plain basked in noon 's broad light .</l>
     <l n="80">He dragged his weary frame some paces more ,</l>
     <l n="81">Unto a solitary herdsman 's hut ,</l>
     <l n="82">Which , in the vagueness of the moonlit night ,</l>
     <l n="83">Was touched with lines of beauty , till it grew</l>
     <l n="84">Fair as the ruined works of ancient art ,</l>
     <l n="85">Now squat and hideous with its wattled roof ,</l>
     <l n="86">Decaying timbers , and loose door wide oped ,</l>
     <l n="87">Half-fallen from the hinge . A drowsy man ,</l>
     <l n="88">Bearded and burnt , in shepherd habit lay ,</l>
     <l n="89">Stretched on the floor , slow-munching , half asleep ,</l>
     <l n="90">His frugal fare ; for thus , at blaze of noon ,</l>
     <l n="91">The shepherds sought a shelter from the sun ,</l>
     <l n="92">Leaving their vigilant dogs beside their flock .</l>
     <l n="93">The knight craved drink and bread , and with respect</l>
     <l n="94">For pilgrim weeds , the Roman herdsman stirred</l>
     <l n="95">His lazy length , and shared with him his meal .</l>
     <l n="96">Refreshed and calm , Sir Tannhauser passed forth ,</l>
     <l n="97">Yearning with morbid fancy once again</l>
     <l n="98">To see the kind face of the minstrel boy</l>
     <l n="99">He met beside the well . At set of sun</l>
     <l n="100">He reached the place ; the reaping-folk were gone ,</l>
     <l n="101">The day 's toil over , yet he took his seat .</l>
     <l n="102">A milking-girl with laden buckets full ,</l>
     <l n="103">Came slowly from the pasture , paused and drank .</l>
     <l n="104">From a near cottage ran a ragged boy ,</l>
     <l n="105">And filled his wooden pail , and to his home</l>
     <l n="106">Returned across the fields . A herdsman came ,</l>
     <l n="107">And drank and gave his dog to drink , and passed ,</l>
     <l n="108">Greeting the holy man who sat there still ,</l>
     <l n="109">Awaiting . But his feeble pulse beat high</l>
     <l n="110">When he descried at last a youthful form ,</l>
     <l n="111">Crossing the field , a pitcher on his head ,</l>
     <l n="112">Advancing towards the well . Yea , this was he ,</l>
     <l n="113">The same grave eyes , and open , girlish face .</l>
     <l n="114">But he saw not , amidst the landscape brown ,</l>
     <l n="115">The knight 's brown figure , who , to win his ear ,</l>
     <l n="116">Asked the lad 's name . “ My name is Salvator ,</l>
     <l n="117">To serve you , sir , ” he carelessly replied ,</l>
     <l n="118">With eyes and hands intent upon his jar ,</l>
     <l n="119">Brimming and bubbling . Then he cast one glance</l>
     <l n="120">Upon his questioner , and left the well ,</l>
     <l n="121">Crying with keen and sudden sympathy ,</l>
     <l n="122">“ Good Father , pardon me , I knew you not .</l>
     <l n="123">Ah ! you have travelled overmuch : your feet</l>
     <l n="124">Are grimed with mud and wet , your face is changed ,</l>
     <l n="125">Your hands are dry with fever . ” But the knight :</l>
     <l n="126">“ Nay , as I look on thee , I think the Lord</l>
     <l n="127">Wills not that I should suffer any more . ”</l>
     <l n="128">“ Then you have suffered much , ” sighed Salvator ,</l>
     <l n="129">With wondering pity . “ You must come with me ;</l>
     <l n="130">My father knows of you , I told him all .</l>
     <l n="131">A knight and minstrel who cast by his lyre ,</l>
     <l n="132">His health and fame , to give himself to God ,—</l>
     <l n="133">Yours is a life indeed to be desired !</l>
     <l n="134">If you will lie with us this night , our home</l>
     <l n="135">Will verily be blessed . ” By kindness crushed ,</l>
     <l n="136">Wandering in sense and words , the broken knight</l>
     <l n="137">Resisted naught , and let himself be led</l>
     <l n="138">To the boy 's home . The outcast and accursed</l>
     <l n="139">Was welcomed now by kindly human hands ;</l>
     <l n="140">Once more his blighted spirit was revived</l>
     <l n="141">By contact with refreshing innocence .</l>
     <l n="142">There , when the morning broke upon the world ,</l>
     <l n="143">The humble hosts no longer knew their guest .</l>
     <l n="144">His fleshly weeds of sin forever doffed ,</l>
     <l n="145">Tannhauser lay and smiled , for in the night</l>
     <l n="146">The angel came who brings eternal peace .</l>

     <l n="147">Far into Wartburg , through all Italy ,</l>

     <l n="149">Riding in furious haste ; among them , one</l>
     <l n="150">Who bore a branch of dry wood burst in bloom ;</l>
     <l n="151">The pastoral rod had borne green shoots of spring ,</l>
     <l n="152">And leaf and blossom . God is merciful .</l>

     <l n="102">Light-hearted ‘ midst the dewy lanes I fared</l>
     <l n="103">Unto the sea , whose jocund gleam I caught</l>
     <l n="104">Between the slim boles , when I heard the clink</l>
     <l n="105">Of naked weapons , then a sudden thrust</l>
     <l n="106">Sickening to hear , and then a stifled groan ;</l>
     <l n="107">And pressing forward I beheld the sight</l>

     <l n="111">Among the pine-spurs , and his cheek pressed close</l>
     <l n="112">Unto the moist , chill sod : his fingers clutched</l>
     <l n="113">A handful of loose weeds and grass and earth ,</l>
     <l n="114">Uprooted in his anguish as he fell ,</l>
     <l n="115">And slowly from his heart the thick stream flowed ,</l>

     <l n="117">Ghastly , transparent , with blue , stony eyes</l>
     <l n="118">Staring in blankness on that other one</l>
     <l n="119">Who triumphed over him . With hot desire</l>
     <l n="120">Of instant vengeance I unsheathed my sword</l>
     <l n="121">To rush upon the slayer , when he turned</l>

     <l n="124">Within my heart a something snapped and brake .</l>
     <l n="125">What was it but the chord of rapturous joy</l>
     <l n="126">For ever stilled ? I tottered and would fall ,</l>
     <l n="127">Had I not leaned against the friendly pine ;</l>
     <l n="128">For all realities of life , unmoored</l>
     <l n="129">From their firm anchorage , appeared to float</l>
     <l n="130">Like hollow phantoms past my dizzy brain .</l>
     <l n="131">The strange delusion wrought upon my soul</l>
     <l n="132">That this had been enacted ages since .</l>
     <l n="133">This very horror curdled at my heart ,</l>
     <l n="134">This net of trees spread round , these iron heavens ,</l>
     <l n="135">Were closing over me when I had stood ,</l>
     <l n="136">Unnumbered cycles back , and fronted HIM ,</l>
     <l n="137">My father ; and he felt mine eyes as now ,</l>
     <l n="138">Yet saw me not ; and then , as now , that form ,</l>
     <l n="139">The one thing real , lay stretched between us both .</l>
     <l n="140">The fancy passed , and I stood sane and strong</l>
     <l n="141">To grasp the truth . Then I remembered all —</l>
     <l n="142">A few fierce words between them yester eve</l>
     <l n="143">Concerning some poor plot of pasturage ,</l>
     <l n="144">Soon silenced into courteous , frigid calm :</l>
     <l n="145">This was the end . I could not meet him now ,</l>
     <l n="146">To curse him , to accuse him , or to save ,</l>
     <l n="147">And draw him from the red entanglement</l>
     <l n="148">Coiled by his own hands round his ruined life .</l>
     <l n="149">God pardon me ! My heart that moment held</l>
     <l n="150">No drop of pity toward this wretched soul ;</l>
     <l n="151">And cowering down , as though his guilt were mine ,</l>
     <l n="152">I fled amidst the savage silences</l>
     <l n="153">Of that grim wood , resolved to nurse alone</l>
     <l n="154">My boundless desolation , shame , and grief .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="155">There , in that thick-leaved twilight of high noon ,</l>
     <l n="156">The quiet of the still , suspended air ,</l>
     <l n="157">Once more my wandering thoughts were calmly ranged ,</l>
     <l n="158">Shepherded by my will . I wept , I prayed</l>
     <l n="159">A solemn prayer , conceived in agony ,</l>
     <l n="160">Blessed with response instant , miraculous ;</l>
     <l n="161">For in that hour my spirit was at one</l>
     <l n="162">With Him who knows and satisfies her needs .</l>
     <l n="163">The supplication and the blessing sprang</l>
     <l n="164">From the same source , inspired divinely both .</l>
     <l n="165">I prayed for light , self-knowledge , guidance , truth ,</l>
     <l n="166">And these like heavenly manna were rained down</l>
     <l n="167">To feed my hungered soul . His guilt was mine .</l>
     <l n="168">What angel had been sent to stay mine arm</l>
     <l n="169">Until the fateful moment passed away</l>
     <l n="170">That would have ushered an eternity</l>
     <l n="171">Of withering remorse ? I found the germs</l>
     <l n="172">In mine own heart of every human sin ,</l>
     <l n="173">That waited but occasion 's tempting breath</l>
     <l n="174">To overgrow with poisoned bloom my life .</l>
     <l n="175">What God thus far had saved me from myself ?</l>
     <l n="176">Here was the lofty truth revealed , that each</l>

     <l n="179">His proper soul in kinship there is bound .</l>
     <l n="180">Then my life-purpose dawned upon my mind ,</l>

     <l n="182">Crushed by the weight of universal love ,</l>
     <l n="183">Which mine own thoughts had heaped upon myself ,</l>
     <l n="184">I heard the clear chime of a slow , sweet bell .</l>
     <l n="185">I knew it — whence it came and what it sang .</l>
     <l n="186">From the gray convent nigh the wood it pealed ,</l>
     <l n="187">And called the monks to prayer . Vigil and prayer ,</l>
     <l n="188">Clean lives , white days of strict austerity :</l>
     <l n="189">Such were the offerings of these holy saints .</l>
     <l n="190">How far might such not tend to expiate</l>
     <l n="191">A riotous world 's indulgence ? Here my life ,</l>
     <l n="192">Doubly austere and doubly sanctified ,</l>
     <l n="193">Might even for that other one atone ,</l>
     <l n="194">So bound to mine , till both should be forgiven .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="195">They sheltered me , not questioning the need</l>
     <l n="196">That led me to their cloistered solitude .</l>
     <l n="197">How rich , how freighted with pure influence ,</l>
     <l n="198">With dear security of perfect peace ,</l>
     <l n="199">Was the first day I passed within those walls !</l>
     <l n="200">The holy habit of perpetual prayer ,</l>
     <l n="201">The gentle greetings , the rare temperate speech ,</l>
     <l n="202">The chastening discipline , the atmosphere</l>
     <l n="203">Of settled and profound tranquillity ,</l>
     <l n="204">Were even as living waters unto one</l>
     <l n="205">Who perisheth of thirst . Was this the world</l>
     <l n="206">That yesterday seemed one huge battlefield</l>
     <l n="207">For brutish passions ? Could the soul of man</l>
     <l n="208">Withdraw so easily , and erect apart</l>
     <l n="209">Her own fair temple for her own high ends ?</l>
     <l n="210">But this serene contentment slowly waned</l>
     <l n="211">As I discerned the broad disparity</l>
     <l n="212">Betwixt the form and spirit of the laws</l>
     <l n="213">That bound the order in strait brotherhood .</l>
     <l n="214">Yet when I sought to gain a larger love ,</l>
     <l n="215">More rigid discipline , severer truth ,</l>
     <l n="216">And more complete surrender of the soul</l>
     <l n="217">Unto her God , this was to my reproach ,</l>
     <l n="218">And scoffs and gibes beset me on all sides .</l>
     <l n="219">In mine own cell I mortified my flesh ,</l>
     <l n="220">I held aloof from all my brethren 's feasts</l>
     <l n="221">To wrestle with my viewless enemies ,</l>
     <l n="222">Till they should leave their blessing on my head ;</l>
     <l n="223">For nightly was I haunted by that face ,</l>
     <l n="224">White , bloodless , as I saw it ‘ midst the ferns ,</l>
     <l n="225">Now staring out of darkness , and it held</l>
     <l n="226">Mine eyes from slumber and my brain from rest</l>
     <l n="227">And drove me from my straw to weep and pray .</l>
     <l n="228">Rebellious thoughts such subtle torture wrought</l>
     <l n="229">Upon my spirit that I lay day-long</l>
     <l n="230">In dumb despair , until the blessed hope</l>
     <l n="231">Of mercy dawned again upon my soul ,</l>
     <l n="232">As gradual as the slow gold moon that mounts</l>
     <l n="233">The airy steps of heaven . My faith arose</l>
     <l n="234">With sure perception that disaster , wrong ,</l>
     <l n="235">And every shadow of man 's destiny</l>
     <l n="236">Are merely circumstance , and cannot touch</l>
     <l n="237">The soul 's fine essence : they exist or die</l>
     <l n="238">Only as she affirms them or denies .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="239">This faith sustain me even to the end :</l>
     <l n="240">It floods my heart with peace as surely now</l>
     <l n="241">As on that day the friars drove me forth ,</l>
     <l n="242">Urging that my asceticism , too harsh ,</l>
     <l n="243">Endured through pride , would bring into reproach</l>
     <l n="244">Their customs and their order . Then began</l>
     <l n="245">My exile in the mountains , where I bode</l>
     <l n="246">A hunted man . The elements conspired</l>
     <l n="247">Against me , and I was the seasons ’ sport ,</l>
     <l n="248">Drenched , parched , and scorched and frozen alternately ,</l>
     <l n="249">Burned with shrewd frosts , prostrated by fierce heats ,</l>
     <l n="250">Shivering ‘ neath chilling dews and gusty rains ,</l>
     <l n="251">And buffeted by all the winds of heaven .</l>
     <l n="252">Yet was this period my time of joy :</l>
     <l n="253">My daily thoughts perpetual converse held</l>
     <l n="254">With angels ministrant ; mine ears were charmed</l>
     <l n="255">With sweet accordance of celestial sounds ,</l>
     <l n="256">Song , harp and choir , clear ringing through the air .</l>
     <l n="257">And visions were revealed unto mine eyes</l>
     <l n="258">By night and day of Heaven 's very courts ,</l>
     <l n="259">In shadowless , undimmed magnificence .</l>
     <l n="260">I gave God thanks , not that He sheltered me ,</l>
     <l n="261">And fed me as He feeds the fowls of air —</l>
     <l n="262">For had I perished , this too had been well —</l>
     <l n="263">But for the revelation of His truth ,</l>
     <l n="264">The glory , the beatitude vouchsafed</l>
     <l n="265">To exalt , to heal , to quicken , to inspire ;</l>
     <l n="266">So that the pinched , lean excommunicate</l>
     <l n="267">Was crowned with joy more solid , more secure ,</l>
     <l n="268">Than all the comfort of the vales could bring .</l>
     <l n="269">Then the good Lord touched certain fervid hearts ,</l>
     <l n="270">Aspiring toward His love , to come to me ,</l>
     <l n="271">Timid and few at first ; but as they heard</l>
     <l n="272">From mine own lips the precious oracles ,</l>
     <l n="273">That soothed the trouble of their souls , appeased</l>
     <l n="274">Their spiritual hunger , and disclosed</l>
     <l n="275">All of the God within them to themselves ,</l>
     <l n="276">They flocked about me , and they hailed me saint ,</l>
     <l n="277">And sware to follow and to serve the good</l>
     <l n="278">Which my word published and my life declared .</l>
     <l n="279">Thus the lone hermit of the mountain-top</l>
     <l n="280">Descended leader of a band of saints ,</l>
     <l n="281">And midway ‘ twixt the summit and the vale</l>
     <l n="282">I perched my convent . Yet I bated not</l>
     <l n="283">One whit of strict restraint and abstinence .</l>
     <l n="284">And they who love me and who serve the truth</l>
     <l n="285">Have learned to suffer with me , and have won</l>
     <l n="286">The supreme joy that is not of the flesh ,</l>
     <l n="287">Foretasting the delights of Paradise .</l>
     <l n="288">This faith , to them imparted , will endure</l>
     <l n="289">After my tongue hath ceased to utter it ,</l>
     <l n="290">And the great peace hath settled on my soul .</l>

     <l n="1">The fervent , pale-faced Mother ere she sleep ,</l>

     <l n="5">World above world , and heaven over heaven .</l>

     <l n="7">Rests on a steadfast , ruddy-shining light ,</l>
     <l n="8">High in the tower , an earthly star of even .</l>
     <l n="9">Hers is the faith in saints ’ and angels ’ power ,</l>
     <l n="10">And mediating love — she breathes a prayer</l>
     <l n="11">For yon tired watcher in the gray old tower .</l>
     <l n="12">He the shrewd , skeptic poet unaware</l>
     <l n="13">Feels comforted and stilled , and knows not whence</l>

     <l n="2">SCENE — During the first four acts , in Naples ; latter part of the</l>
     <l n="3">fifth act , in Palermo . Time , about 1655 .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>ACT . I .</p>
   <p>SCENE I .</p>
   <p>The studio of the Spagnoletto . RIBERA at work before his canvas . MARIA seated some distance behind him ; a piece of embroidery is in her hands , but she glances up from it incessantly toward her father with impatient movements .</p>
   <p>MARIA . Father ! ( RIBERA , absorbed in his work , makes no reply ; she puts by her embroidery , goes toward him and kisses him gently . He starts , looks up at her , and returns her caress ) .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . My child !</p>
   <p>MARIA . Already you forget , Oh , heedless father ! Did you not promise me To lay aside your brush to-day at noon , And tell me the great secret ?</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Ah , ‘ t is true , I am to blame . But it is morning yet ; My child , wait still a little .</p>
   <p>MARIA . ‘ T is morning yet ! Nay , it was noon one mortal hour ago . All patience I have sat till you should turn And beckon me . The rosy angels breathe Upon the canvas ; I might sit till night , And , if I spake not , you would never glance From their celestial faces . Dear my father , Your brow is moist , and yet your hands are ice ; Your very eyes are tired — pray , rest awhile . The Spagnoletto need no longer toil As in the streets of Rome for beggars ’ fare ; Now princes bide his pleasure .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">RIBERA ( throws aside his brush and palette ) .</l>
     <l n="2">Ah , Maria ,</l>
     <l n="3">Thou speak'st in season . Let me ne'er forget</l>
     <l n="4">Those days of degradation , when I starved</l>
     <l n="5">Before the gates of palaces . The germs</l>
     <l n="6">Stirred then within me of the perfect fruits</l>
     <l n="7">Wherewith my hands have since enriched God 's world .</l>
     <l n="8">Vengeance I vowed for every moment 's sting —</l>
     <l n="9">Vengeance on wealth , rank , station , fortune , genius .</l>
     <l n="10">See , while I paint , all else escapes my sense ,</l>
     <l n="11">Save this bright throng of phantasies that press</l>
     <l n="12">Upon my brain , each claiming from my hand</l>
     <l n="13">Its immortality . But thou , my child ,</l>
     <l n="14">Remind'st me of mine oath , my sacred pride ,</l>
     <l n="15">The eternal hatred lodged within my breast .</l>
     <l n="16">Philip of Spain shall wait . I will not deign</l>
     <l n="17">To add to-day the final touch of life</l>
     <l n="18">Unto this masterpiece .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>MARIA . So ! that is well . Put by the envious brush that separates Father from daughter . Now you are all mine own . And now — your secret .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Mine ? ‘ T is none of mine ; ‘ T is thine , Maria . John of Austria Desires our presence at his ball to-night .</p>
   <p>MARIA . Prince John ?</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Ay , girl , Prince John . I looked to see A haughty joy dance sparkling in thine eyes And burn upon thy cheek . But what is this ? Timid and pale , thou droop'st thy head abashed As a poor flower-girl whom a lord accosts .</p>
   <p>MARIA . Forgive me . Sure , ‘ t is you Don John desires The prince of artists —</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Art ! Prate not of art ! Think'st thou I move an artist ‘ midst his guests ? As such I commune with a loftier race ; Angels and spirits are my ministers . These do I part aside to grace his halls ; A Spanish gentleman — and so , his peer .</p>
   <p>MARIA . Father , I am not well ; my head throbs fast , Unwonted languor weighs upon my frame .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Anger me not , Maria . ‘ T is my will , Thou shalt obey . Hell , what these women be ! No obstacle would daunt them in the quest Of that which , freely given , they reject . Hold ! Haply just occasion bids thee seem Unlike thyself . Speak fearlessly child ; Confide to me thy knowledge , thy surmise .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">MARIA ( hurriedly ) .</l>
     <l n="2">No , father , you were right . I have no cause ;</l>
     <l n="3">Punish me — nay , forgive , and I obey .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>RIBERA . There spake my child ; kiss me and be forgiven . Sometimes I doubt thou playest upon my love Willfully , knowing me as soft as clay , Whom the world knows of marble . In such moods , I see my spirit mirror 's first , and then From thy large eyes thy sainted mother 's soul Unclouded shine .</p>
   <p>MARIA . Can I be like to her ? I only knew her faded , white , and grave , And so she still floats vaguely through my dreams , With eyes like your own angels ’ , and a brow Worthy an aureole .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . An earthly crown , My princess , might more fitly rest on thine . Annicca hath her colors , blue-black hair , And pale , brown flesh , and gray , untroubled eyes ; Yet thou more often bring'st her to mind , For all the tawny gold of thy thick locks , Thy rare white face , and brilliant Spanish orbs . Thine is her lisping trick of voice , her laugh , The blithest music still this side of heaven ; Thine her free , springing gait , though therewithal A swaying , languid motion all thine own , Recalls Valencia more than Italy . Like and unlike thou art to her , as still My memory loves to hold her , as she first Beamed like the star of morning on my life . Hot , faint , and footsore , I had paced since dawn The sun-baked streets of Naples , seeking work , Not alms , despite the beggar that I looked . Now ‘ t was nigh vespers , and my suit had met With curt refusal , sharp rebuff , and gibes . Praised be the saints ! for every drop of gall In that day 's brimming cup , I have upheld A poisoned beaker to another 's lips . Many a one hath the Ribera taught To fare a vagabond through alien streets ; A god unrecognized ‘ midst churls and clowns , With kindled soul aflame , and body faint Or lack of bread . Domenichino knows , And Gessi , Guido , Annibal Caracci —</p>
   <p>MARIA . Dear father , calm yourself . You had begun To tell me how you saw my mother first .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . True , I forgot it not . Why , I AM calm ; The old man now can well be grave and cold , Or laugh at his own youth 's indignities , Past a long lifetime back . ‘ T was vespers ’ hour , Or nigh it , when I reached her father 's door . Kind was his greeting , the first cordial words I heard in Naples ; but I took small heed Of speech or toe , for all my sense was rapt In wonder at the angel by his side Who smiled upon me . Large , clear eyes that held The very soul of sunlight in their depths ; Low , pure , pale brow , with masses of black hair Flung loosely back , and rippling unconfined In shadowy magnificence below The slim gold girdle o'er the snow-soft gown . Vested and draped about her throat and waist and wrists , A stately lily ere the dew of morn Hath passed away — such was thy mother , child .</p>
   <p>MARIA . Would I were like her ! But what said she , father ? How did she plead for you ?</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Ah , cunning child , I see thy tricks ; thou humorest my age , Knowing how much I love to tell this tale , Though thou hast heard it half a hundred times .</p>
   <p>MARIA . I find it sweet to hear as you to tell , Believe me , father .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . ‘ T was to pleasure her , Signor Cortese gave me all I lacked To prove my unfamed skill . A savage pride , Matched oddly with my rags , the haughtiness Wherewith I claimed rather than begged my tools , And my quaint aspect , oft she told me since , Won at a glance her faith . Before I left , She guessed my need , and served me meat and wine With her own flower-white hands . The parting grace I craved was granted , that my work might be The portrait of herself . Thou knowest the rest .</p>
   <p>MARIA . Why did she leave us , father ? Oh , how oft I yearn to see her face , to hear her voice , Hushed in an endless silence ! Strange that she , Whose rich love beggared our return , should bear Such separation ! Though engirdled now By heavenly hosts of saints and seraphim , I cannot fancy it . What ! shall her child , Whose lightest sigh reechoed in her heart , Have need of her and cry to her in vain ?</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Now , for God 's sake , Maria , speak not thus ; Let me not see such tears upon thy cheek . Not unto us it has been given to guess The peace of disembodied souls like hers . The vanishing glimpses that my fancies catch Through heaven 's half-opened gates , exalt even me , Poor sinner that I am . And what are these , The painted shadows that make all my life A glory , to the splendor of that light ? For thee , my child , has not my doting love Sufficed , at least in part , to fill the breach Of that tremendous void ? What dost thou lack ? What help , what counsel , what most dear caress ? What dost thou covet ? What least whim remains Ungratified , because not yet expressed ?</p>
   <p>MARIA . None , none , dear father ! Pardon me ! Thy love , Generous and wise as tender , shames my power To merit or repay . Fie o my lips ! Look if they be not blistered . Let them smooth With contrite kisses the last frown away . We must be young to-night — no wrinkles then ! Genius must show immortal as she is .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Thou wilt unman me with thy pretty ways . I had forgot the ball . Yea , I grow old ; This scanty morning 's work has wearied me . Once I had thought it play to dream all day Before my canvas and then dance till dawn , And now must I give o'er and rest at noon . [ Rises . ]</p>
   <p>Enter LUCA , ushering in LORENZO , who carries a portfolio .</p>
   <p>LUCA . Signor Lorenzo . [ LORENZO ceremoniously salutes RIBERA and MARIA . Exit LUCA . ]</p>
   <p>LORENZO . Master , I bring my sketch . [ Opens his portfolio and hands a sketch to RIBERA . ]</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Humph ! the design is not so ill-conceived ; I note some progress ; but your drawing 's bad — Yes , bad , sir . Mark you how this leg hangs limp , As though devoid of life ; these hands seem clenched , Not loosely clasped , as you intended them . [ He takes his pencil and makes a few strokes . Thus should it stand — a single line will mend . And here , what 's this ? Why , ‘ t is a sloven 's work . You dance too many nights away , young gallant . You shirk close labor as do all your mates . You think to win with service frivolous , Snatched ‘ twixt your cups , or set between two kisses , The favor of the mistress of the world .</p>
   <p>LORENZO . Your pardon , master , but you do me wrong . Mayhap I lack the gift . Alas , I fear it ! But not the patience , not the energy Of earnest , indefatigable toil , That help to make the artist .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . ‘ S death ! He dares Belie me , and deny the testimony Of his own handiwork , whose every line Betrays a sluggard soul , an indolent will , A brain that 's bred to idleness . So be it ! Master Lorenzo tells the Spagnoletto His own defects and qualities ! ‘ T were best He find another teacher competent To guide so apt , so diligent a scholar .</p>
   <p>MARIA . Dear father , what hath given thee offence ? Cast but another glance upon the sketch ; Surely it hath some grace , some charm , some promise .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Daughter , stand by ! I know these insolent slips Of young nobility ; they lack the stuff That makes us artists . What ! to answer me ! When next I drop a hint as to his colors , The lengthening or the shortening of a stroke , He 'll bandy words with me about his error , To prove himself the master .</p>
   <p>LORENZO . If my defect Be an hereditary grain i ’ the blood , Even as you say , I must abide by it ; But if patrician habits more than birth Beget such faults , then may I dare to hope . Not mine , I knew , I felt , to clear new paths , To win new kingdoms ; yet were I content With such achievement as a strenuous will , A firm endeavor , unfaltering love , And an unwearying spirit might attain . Cast me not lightly back . Banish me not From this , my home of hope , of inspiration !</p>
   <p>MARIA . What , my ungentle father ! Will you hear , And leave this worthy signor 's suit unanswered ?</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Well , he may bide . Sir , I will speak with you Anon upon this work . I judged in haste . Yea , it hath merit . I am weary now ; To-morrow I shall be in fitter mood To give you certain hints . [ LORENZO bows his thanks and advances to address MARIA . RIBERA silences and dismisses him with a wave of the hand . Exit LORENZO . ]</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Should I o'ersleep Mine hour , Maria , thou must awaken me ; But come what may , I will be fresh to-night , To triumph in thy triumph . [ Exit RIBERA . ]</p>

   <p>LORENZO . ‘ T is your goodness , And not the echo of his praise , that speaks . My work was worthless — ‘ t was your generous voice Alone secured the master 's second glance .</p>
   <p>MARIA . Nay , signor , frankly , he esteems your talent . Because you are of well-assured means And gentle birth , he will be rude to you . Not without base is the deep grudge he owes To riches and prosperity .</p>
   <p>LORENZO . Signora , Why do I bear such harsh , injurious terms As he affronts me with ? Why must I seem In mine own eyes a craven ? Spiritless , Dishonorably patient ? ‘ T is not his fame , His power , his gift , his venerable years That bind me here his willing slave . Maria , ‘ T is thou , ‘ t is thou alone ! ‘ T is that I love thee , And exile hence is death ! [ A pause . He kneels at her feet .

Yet , to-day you seem Other than you have been . A milder light Beams from your eyes — a gentler grace is throned Upon your brow — your words fall soft as dew To melt my fixed resolve .</p>
   <p>MARIA . You find me , signor , In an unguarded mood . I would be true To you ; and to myself ; yet , know no answer . Anon , I will be calm ; pray you withdraw .</p>

   <p>While MARIA sits rapt in thought , enter from behind her , ANNICCA , who bends over her and kisses her brow .</p>
   <p>ANNICCA . What , sister ! lost in dreams by daylight ? Fie ! Who is the monarch of thy thoughts ?</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">MARIA ( starting ) .</l>
     <l n="2">Annicca !</l>
     <l n="3">My thoughts are bounden to no master yet ;</l>
     <l n="4">They fly from earth to heaven in a breath .</l>
     <l n="5">Now are they all of earth . Hast heard the tidings ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>ANNICCA . Yea — of the Prince 's ball ? We go together . Braid in thy hair our mother 's pearls , and wear The amulet ingemmed with eastern stones ; ‘ T will bring good fortune .</p>
   <p>MARIA . Tell me , ere we go , What manner of man is John of Austria ?</p>
   <p>ANNICCA . Scarce man at all — a madcap , charming boy ; Well-favored — you have seen him — exquisite In courtly compliment , of simple manners ; You may not hear a merrier laugh than his From any boatman on the bay ; well-versed In all such arts as most become his station ; Light in the dance as winged-foot Mercury , Eloquent on the zither , and a master Of rapier and —</p>
   <p>MARIA . A puppet could be made To answer in all points your praise of him . Hath he no substance as of a man ?</p>
   <p>ANNICCA . Why , sister , What may that be to us ?</p>
   <p>MARIA . He is our Prince .</p>
   <p>ANNICCA . The promise of his youth is to outstrip The hero of Lepanto ; bright and bold As fire , he is the very soul , the star Of Spanish chivalry ; his last achievement Seems still the flower of his accomplishments . Musician , soldier , courtier , yea , and artist . “ He had been a painter , were he not a prince , ” Says Messer Zurbaran . The Calderona , His actress-mother , hath bequeathed to him Her spirit with her beauty , and the power To win and hold men 's hearts .</p>
   <p>MARIA . I knew it , sister ! His eye hath a command in it ; his brow Seems garlanded with laurel .</p>
   <p>ANNICCA . What is this ? You kindle with his praise , your whole heart glows In light and color on your face , your words Take wing and fly as bold as reckless birds . What ! can so rash a thought , a dream so wild , So hopeless an ambition , tempt your soul ?</p>
   <p>MARIA . Pray you , what thought , what dream , and what ambition ? I knew not I had uttered any such .</p>
   <p>ANNICCA . Nor have you in your speech ; your eyes now veiled , Where the light leaped to hear me voice his fame , Your blushes and your pallor have betrayed That which should lie uncounted fathom deep — The secret of a woman 's foolish heart .</p>
   <p>MARIA . And there it lies , my sibyl sister , still ! Your plummet hath not reached it . Yes , ‘ t is love Flaunts his triumphant colors in my cheek , And quickens my lame speech — but not for him , Not for the Prince — so may I vaunt his worth With a free soul .</p>
   <p>ANNICCA . Say on .</p>
   <p>MARIA . A gentleman , Favored of earth and heaven , true and loving , Hath cast his heart at my imperial feet ; And if to-morrow find me as to-day , I will e'en stoop and raise it to mine own .</p>
   <p>ANNICCA . Signor Vitruvio ?</p>
   <p>MARIA . Not he , indeed ! Did not I say favored of earth and heaven ? That should mean other gifts than bags of gold , Or a straight-featured mask . Nor will it be Any you name , though you should name him right . Must it not lie — how many fathom deep — The secret of a woman 's foolish heart ?</p>
   <p>ANNICCA . Kiss me , Maria . You are still a child . You cannot vex me , wilful as you be . Your choice , I fear not , doubtless ‘ t will prove wise , Despite your wild wit , for your heart is pure , And you will pause with sure deliberate judgment Before you leave our father .</p>
   <p>MARIA . Does love steal So gently o'er our soul ? What if he come A cloud , a fire , a whirlwind , to o'erbear The feeble barriers wherewith we oppose him , And blind our eyes and wrest from us our reason ? Fear not , Annicca , for in no such guise He visits my calm breast ; but yet you speak Somewhat too sagely . Did such cautious wisdom Guide your own fancy ?</p>
   <p>ANNICCA . Jest no more , Maria . Since I became a wife , is much made clear , Which a brief year ago was dark and vague . Tommaso loves me — we are happier Then I had dreamed ; yet matching now with then , I see his love is not that large , rich passion Our father bore us .</p>
   <p>MARIA . You regret your home ?</p>
   <p>ANNICCA . No , no ! I have no wish and no regret . I speak for you . His is a sovereign soul , And all his passions loom in huger shape Than lesser men 's . He brooks no rivalry With his own offspring , and toward me his love Hath ebbed , I mark , to a more even flow , While deeper , stronger , sets the powerful current Toward you alone . Consider this , Maria , Nor wantonly discrown that sacred head Of your young love to wreathe some curled boy 's brow .</p>
   <p>MARIA . Think you his wish were that I should not wed ?</p>
   <p>ANNICCA . Nay , that I say not , for his pride aspires To see you nobly mated .</p>

    <head>SCENE II .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A hall in RIBERA 'S house . Enter LUCA and FIAMETTA .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">FIAMETTA .</l>
     <l n="3">But did you see her ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">LUCA .</l>
     <l n="5">Nay , I saw her sister , Donna Annicca .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>FIAMETTA . Tush , man ! never name her beside my lady Maria-Rosa . You have lost the richest feast in the world for hungry eyes . Her gown of cloth o ’ silver clad her , as it were , with light ; there twinkled about her waist a girdle stiff with stones — you would have said they breathed . Mine own hands wreathed the dropping pearls in her hair , and pearls again were clasped around her throat . But no , I might tell thee every ornament — her jeweled fan , her comb of pearls , her floating veil of gauze , and still the best of all would escape us .</p>
   <p>LUCA . Thou speakest more like her page than her handmaiden .</p>
   <p>FIAMETTA . Thou knowest not woman truly , for all thy wit . I speak most like a woman when I weigh the worth of beauty and rich apparel . Heigh-ho ! I have felt the need of this . Thou , good Luca , who might have been my father , canst understand me ? HE was poor as thou . Why shouldst thou be his lackey , his slave ? My hand were as dainty as hers , if it could but be spared its daily labor .</p>
   <p>LUCA . Yes , poor child , I understand thee , and yet thou art wrong . He is more slave to pride than I am to him . I know him well , Fiametta , after so many years of service , and to-day I pity him more than I fear him . Why , girl , my task is sport beside his toil ! If my limbs be weary , I sleep ; but I have seen him sit before his canvas with straining eyes and the big beads standing on his brow . When at last he gave o'er , and I have smoothed his pillow , and served and soothed him , what sleep could he snatch ? His brain is haunted with evil visions , whereof some be merely of his own imaginings , and others the phantoms of folk who are living or have lived , and who rouse his jealousy or mayhap his remorse , God only knows ! If that be genius — to be alive to pain at every pore , to be possessed of a devil that robs you of your sleep and grants no space between the hours of grinding toil — I thank the saints I am a simple man !</p>
   <p>FIAMETTA . I grant thee thou mayst be right concerning him ; he hath indeed a strange , sour mien . I shudder when he turns suddenly , as his wont is , and bends his evil eyes on me . The holy father tells me such warnings come from God . No matter how slight the service he asks of me , my flesh creeps and my limbs refuse to move , till I have whispered an Ave . But what of Lady Maria-Rosa ? Both heaven and earth smile upon her . To-night she wears a poor girl 's dowry , a separate fortune , on her head , her neck , her hands , yes , on her little jeweled feet . One tiny shoe of hers would make me free to wed my lad .</p>
   <p>LUCA . If he have but eyes , I warrant thee he finds jewels enough in thy bright face . Tell me his name .</p>
   <p>FIAMETTA . Nay , that is my secret .</p>
   <p>LUCA . He must be a poor-souled lad if he will wait till thou hast earned a dowry .</p>
   <p>FIAMETTA . A poor-souled lad ! my good Vicenzo — ah ! but no matter ; thou knowest him , Luca , my Lord Lorenzo 's page . There !— is he poor , or mean , or plain , or dull ? He claims no dowry , he — but I have my pride , as well as the great ones .</p>
   <p>LUCA . May the saints preserve thee from such as theirs ! I am heartily glad of thy good fortune . I am not sure whether thou or Lady Marie-Rosa be the most favored . Well , the end proves all . [ Exeunt . ]</p>
   <p>Enter on one side ANNICCA and DON TOMMASO , attired for the ball ; on the other side , RIBERA .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . What do ye here , my children ? Haste away ! Maria waits you for the ball ; folk say ‘ T will be the bravest show e'er seen in Naples . I warrant you the Spagnoletto brings The richest jewels — what say'st thou , my son ?</p>
   <p>DON TOMMASO . I who have robbed you of one gem , need scarce Re-word , sir , how I prize it .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Why , ‘ t is true . Robbed me , thou sayst ? So hast thou . She was mine — The balanced beauty of her flesh and spirit , That was my garland , and I was her all , Till thou , a stranger , stole her heart 's allegiance , Suborned — Forgive me , I am old , a father , Whose doting passions blind . I am not jealous , Believe me , sir . When we Riberas give , We give without retraction or reserve , Were it our life-blood . I rejoice with thee That she is thine ; nor am I quite bereft , I have some treasure still . I do repent So heartily of my discourteous speech , That I will crave your leave before I kiss Your wife 's soft palm .</p>

   <p>DON JOHN . Now hope , now fear Reigned lord of my wild dreams . One name still sang Like the repeated strain of some caged bird , Its sweet , persistent music through my brain . One vanishing face upon the empty air Shone forth and faded night and day . And you , Did you not find me hasty , over-bold ? Nay , tell me all your thought .</p>
   <p>MARIA . You know , my lord , I am no courtier , and belike my thought Might prove too rustic for a royal ear .</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . Speak on , speak on ! Though you should rail , your voice would still outsing Rebeck and mandoline .</p>
   <p>MARIA . Is it not strange ? I knew you not , albeit I might have guessed , If only from the simple garb of black , And golden collar , ‘ midst the motley hues Of our gay nobles . I know not what besides , But this first won me . Be not angered , sir ; But , as I looked , I never ranked you higher Than simple gentleman . I asked your name ; Then , when you Highness stooped to pick my flower , My lord , that moment was my thought a traitor , For it had fain discrowned you .</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . May God 's angels Reward such treason . Say me those words again . Let the rich blush born of that dear confession Again dye cheek and brow , and fade and melt Forever , even as then .</p>
   <p>MARIA . We are watched , my lord . This is no place , no hour , for words like these .</p>

    <head>SCENE II .</head>
    <head>The Palace Gardens . Interrupted sounds of music and revelry come though the open windows of the ball-room , seen in the background . RIBERA , pacing the stage , occasionally pausing to look in upon the dancers .</head>
    <head>RIBERA . This is revenge . Is she not beautiful , Ye gods ? The beggar 's child matched with a prince ! Throb not so high , my heart , ‘ neath envious eyes Fixed on thy triumph ! Now am I well repaid For my slow , martyred years . Was I not wrung by keener tortures than my savage brush , Though dipped in my heart 's blood , might reproduce ! No twisted muscle , no contorted limb , No agony of flesh , have I yet drawn , That owed not its suggestion to some pang Of my pride crucified , my spirit racked , My entrails gnawed by the blind worm of hate , Engendered of oppression . That is past , But not forgotten ; though to-night I please To yield to gentler influence , to own The strength of beauty and the power of joy , And welcome gracious phantasies that throng And hover over me in airy shapes . The spirits of earth and heaven contend to-night For mastery within me ; ne'er before Have I been more the Spagnoletto , fired With noble wrath , with the consuming fever And fierce delight of vengeance . From this point I see her clearly — the auroral face A-light with smiles , the imperial head upraised ; Her languid hand sways the broad , silken fan , Whose wing-like movement stirs above her brow The fine , bright curls , as though warm airs of heaven Around her breathed . He leads her ‘ midst the throng . So , they have gone ; but I will follow them , And watch them from afar . [ Exit . ]</head>
     <l n="1">Enter from the opposite side DON JOHN and MARIA .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>DON JOHN . I dread to ask What quivers on my lips . My heart is free , But thine ?</p>
   <p>MARIA . My heart is free , my lord .</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . Thank God !</p>
   <p>MARIA . It never beat less calmly at the sound Of any voice till now . I laugh to think This very morn I fancied it had met Its master .</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . Ah !</p>
   <p>MARIA . Fear naught — a simple boy , A pupil of my father 's .</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . I was mad To dream it could be otherwise . Forgive me ; I , a mere stranger in they life , am jealous Of all thy present and thy past .</p>
   <p>MARIA . Listen , my lord ; You shall hear all . What hour , think you , he chose To urge his cause ? The same wherein I learned Your Highness had commanded for to-night Our presence . My winged thoughts were flying back To Count Lodovico 's ; again I saw you , My white rose at your lips , your grave eyes fixed Most frankly , yet most reverently , on mine . Again my heart sank as I heard the name , The Prince of Austria ; and while I mused , He spake of love . Oh , I am much to blame ! My mood was soft ;— although I promised naught , I listened , yea , I listened . Good , my lord , Do you not pity him ?</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . Thanks , and thanks again , For thy confession ! Now no spot remains On the unblemished mirror of my faith . Since that dear night , I with one only thought Have gained the sum of knowledge and opinions Touching thine honored father , with such scraps As the gross public voice could dole to me Concerning thine own far-removed , white life . Thou art , I learn , immured in close seclusion ; Thy father , be it with all reverence said , Hedges with jealous barriers his treasure ; Whilst thou , most duteous , tenderest of daughters , Breath'st but for him .</p>
   <p>MARIA . Dear father ! Were it so , ‘ T were simple justice . Ah , if you knew him — A proud , large , tameless heart . This is the cloister Where he immures me — Naples ’ gayest revels ; The only bar wherewith he hedges me Is his unbounded trust , that leaves me free . Let us go in ; the late night air is chill .</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . Yet one more dance ?</p>
   <p>MARIA . You may command , my lord . [ Exeunt . ]</p>
   <p>Enter RIBERA .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . I lost them in the press . Ah , there they dance Again together . I would lay my hands In blessing on that darling , haughty head . Like the Ribera 's child , she bears her honors As lightly as a flower . Yet there glows Unwonted lustre in her starry eyes , And richer beauty blushes on her cheek . Enough . Now must I strive to fix that form That haunts my brain — the blind , old Count Camillo , The Prince 's oracle . ‘ Midst the thick throng My fancy singled him ; white beard , white hair , Sealed eyes , and brow lit by an inward light . So will I paint mine Isaac blessing Esau , While Jacob kneels before him — blind , betrayed By his own flesh !</p>
   <p>As RIBERA stands aside , lost in thought , enter DON JOHN and MARIA .</p>
   <p>MARIA . See the impatient day Wakes in the east .</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . One moment here , signora , Breathe we the charm of this enchanted night . Look where behind yon vines the slow moon sets , Hidden from us , while every leaf hangs black , Each tender stalk distinct , each curling edge Against the silver sky .</p>

     <l n="1">MARIA ( perceiving RIBERA ) .</l>
     <l n="2">What , father ! here ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>RIBERA . Maria !— Ah , my Prince , I crave your pardon . When thus I muse , ‘ t is but my mind that lives ; Each outward sense is dead . I saw you not , I heard nor voice nor footstep . Yonder lines That streak the brightening sky east warn us away . For all your grace to us , the Spagnoletto Proffers his thanks to John of Austria . My daughter , art thou ready ?</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . I am bound , Illustrious signor , rather unto you And the signora , past all hope of payment . When may I come to tender my poor homage To the Sicilian master ?</p>
   <p>RIBERA . My lord will jest . Our house is too much honored when he deigns O'erstep the threshold . Let your royal pleasure Alone decide the hour .</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . To-morrow , then . Or I should say to-day , for dawn is nigh .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . And still we trespass . Be it as you will ; We are your servants .</p>

   <p>LORENZO . Good-day , sweet mistress . May the blithe spirit of this auspicious morn Become the genius of thy days to come , Whereof be none less beautiful than this . Why art thou silent ? Does not love inspire Joyous expression , be it but a sigh , A song , a smile , a broken word , a cry ? Thou hast not granted me the promised pledge For which I hunger still . I would confirm With dear avowals , frequent seals of love , That which , though sure , I yet can scarce believe .</p>
   <p>MARIA . Somewhat too sure , I think , my lord Lorenzo . I scarce deemed possible that one so shy But yester-morn should hold so high a mien , Claiming what ne'er was given .</p>

   <p>MARIA . Sir , You are a trifle bold to speak my name Familiarly as no man , save my father Or my own brother , dares .</p>
   <p>LORENZO . Ah , now I see Your jest . You will not seem so lightly won Without a wooing ? You will feign disdain , Only to make more sweet your rich concession ? Too late — I heard it all . “ A new light shines On the familiar scene . ” What may that be , Save the strange splendor of the dawn of love ? Nay , darling , cease to jest , lest my poor heart , Hanging ‘ twixt hell and heaven , in earnest break .</p>
   <p>MARIA . Here is no jest , sir , but a fatal error , Crying for swift correction . You surprise me With rude impatience , ere I have found time To con a gentle answer . Pardon me If any phrase or word or glance of mine Hath bred or nourished in your heart a hope That you might win my love . It cannot be .</p>

   <p>MARIA . Where have you flown , bright dreams ? Has that rude hand Sufficed to dash to naught your frail creations ? Sad thoughts and humors black now fill my soul . So his rough foot hath bruised the dewy grass , And left it sere . Why should his harsh words touch me ? The truth of yesterday is false to-day . How could I know , dear God ! How might I guess The bitter sweetness , the delicious pain ! A new heart fills my breast , as soft and weak And melting as a tear , unto its lord ; But kindled with quick courage to endure , If I need front for him , a world of foes . If this be love , ah , what a hell is theirs Who suffer without hope ! Even I , who hold So many dear assurances , who hear Still ringing in mine ears such sacred vows , Am haunted with an unaccustomed doubt , Not wonted to go hand-in-hand with joy . A gloomy omen greets me with the morn ; I , who recoil from pain , must strike and wound . What may this mean ? Help me , ye saints of heaven And holy mother , for my strength is naught !</p>
   <p>She falls on her knees and bursts into tears . Reenter LORENZO .</p>

   <p>RIBERA . Daughter ! Maria !</p>
   <p>MARIA . Why , father , I am here ( kissing him ) . Good-day . What will you ?</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Darling , no more than what I always will . Before I enter mine own world removed , I fain would greet the dearest work of God . I missed you when I rose . I sought you first In your own chamber , where the lattice , oped , Let in the morning splendor and smells Of the moist garden , with the sound of voices . I looked , I found you here — but not alone . What man was that went from you ?</p>
   <p>MARIA . Your disciple , My lord Lorenzo . You remember , father , How yester-morn I pleaded for his work ; Thus he , through gratitude and — love , hath watched All night within our garden , while I danced ; And when I came to nurse my flowers — he spake .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . And you ?</p>
   <p>MARIA . Am I not still beside you , father ? I will not leave you .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Ah , mine angel-child ! I cannot choose but dread it , though I wait Expectant of the hour when you fulfil Your woman 's destiny . You have full freedom ; Yet I rejoice at this reprieve , and thank thee For thy brave truthfulness . Be ever thus , Withholding naught from him whose heart reflects Only thine image . Thou art still my pride , Even as last night when all eyes gazed thy way , Thy bearing equal in disdainful grace To his who courted thee — thy sovereign 's son .</p>
   <p>MARIA . Yea , so ? And yet it was not pride I felt , Nor consciousness of self , nor vain delight In the world 's envy ;— something more than these , Far deeper , sweeter — What have I said ? My brain Is dull with sleep . ‘ T is only now I feel The weariness of so much pleasure .</p>

   <p>LUCA . My lord .</p>

   <p>LUCA . Fiametta passed a brief while since , and left My lady sleeping .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Good ! she hath found rest ; Poor child , she sadly lacked it . She had known ‘ Twixt dawn and dawn no respite from emotion ; Her chill hand fluttered like a bird in mine ; Her soft brow burned my lips . Could that boy read The tokens of an overwearied spirit , Strained past endurance , he had spared her still , At any cost of silence . What is such love To mine , that would outrival Roman heroes — Watch mine arm crisp and shrivel in quick flame , Or set a lynx to gnaw my heart away , To save her from a needle-prick of pain , Ay , or to please her ? At their worth she rates Her wooers — light as all-embracing air Or universal sunshine . Luca , go And tell Fiametta — rather , bid the lass Hither herself . [ Exit Luca . ] He comes to pay me homage , As would his royal father , if he pleased To visit Naples ; yet she too shall see him .

   <p>DON JOHN . ‘ T is another jewel Set in my father 's crown , and , in his name , I thank you for it . [ RIBERA bows silently . DON JOHN glances around the studio . ]</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . There hangs a quaint , strong head , Though merely sketched . What a marked , cunning leer Grins on the wide mouth ! what a bestial glance !</p>
   <p>RIBERA . ‘ T is but a slight hint for my larger work , “ Bacchus made drunk by Satyrs . ”</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . Where is that ? I ne'er have seen the painting .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . ‘ T is not in oils , But etched in aqua-fortis . Luca , fetch down Yonder portfolio . I can show your Highness The graven copy . [ LUCA brings forward a large portfolio . RIBERA looks hastily over the engravings and draws one out which he shows to DON JOHN . ]</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . Ah , most admirable ! I know not who is best portrayed — the god , Plump , reeling , wreathed with vine , in whom abides Something Olympian still , or the coarse Satyrs , Thoroughly brutish . Here I scarcely miss , So masterly the grouping , so distinct The bacchanalian spirit , your rich brush , So vigorous in color . Do you find The pleasure in this treatment equals that Of the oil painting ?</p>
   <p>RIBERA . All is in my mood ; We have so many petty talents , clever To mimic Nature 's surface . I name not The servile copyists of the greater masters , Or of th ’ archangels , Raphael and Michael ; But such as paint our cheap and daily marvels . Sometimes I fear lest they degrade our art To a nice craft for plodding artisans — Mere realism , which they mistake for truth . My soul rejects such limits . The true artist Gives Nature 's best effects with far less means . Plain black and white suffice him to express A finer grace , a stronger energy Than she attains with all the aid of color . I argue thus and work with simple tools , Like the Greek fathers of our art — the sculptors , Who wrought in white alone their matchless types . Then dazzled by the living bloom of earth , Glowing with color , I return to that , My earliest worship , and compose such work As you see there . [ Pointing to the picture . ]</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . Would it be overmuch , In my brief stay in Naples , to beg of you A portrait of myself in aqua-fortis ? ‘ T would rob you , sir , of fewer golden hours Than the full-colored canvas , and enrich With a new treasure our royal gallery .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . You may command my hours and all that 's mine .</p>

     <l n="1">DON JOHN ( rising ) .</l>
     <l n="2">Thanks , generous master . When may I return</l>
     <l n="3">For the first sitting ?</l>

   <p>RIBERA . I am ready now — To-day , to-morrow — when your Highness please .</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . ‘ T would be abuse of goodness to accept The present moment . I will come to-morrow , At the same hour , in some more fitting garb . Your hand , sir , and farewell . Salute for me , I pray you , the signora . May I not hope To see and thank her for her grace to me , In so adorning my poor feast ?</p>
   <p>RIBERA . The debt is ours . She may be here to-morrow — she is free , She only , while I work , to come and go . Pray , sir , allow her — she is never crossed . I stoop to beg for her — she is the last Who bides with me — I crave you pardon , sir ; What should this be to you ?</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . ‘ T is much to me , Whose privilege has been in this rare hour , Beneath the master to discern the man , And thus add friendship unto admiration . [ He presses RIBERA 'S hand and is about to pick up his mantle and hat . LUCA springs forward , and , while he is throwing the cloak around the Princes 's shoulders , enter hastily MARIA , enveloped in her mantilla , as she went to church . ]</p>
   <p>MARIA . Well , father , an I veiled and swathed to suit you , To cross the Strada ? [ She throws off her mantilla and appears all in white . She goes to embrace her father , when she suddenly perceives the Prince , and stands speechless and blushing . ]</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Child , his Royal Highness Prince John of Austria .</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . Good-day , signora . Already twice my gracious stars have smiled . I saw you in the street . You wore your mantle , As the noon sun might wear a veil of cloud , Covering , but not concealing .</p>
   <p>MARIA . I , sir , twice Have unaware stood in your royal presence . You are welcome to my father 's home and mine . I scarce need crave your pardon for my entrance ; Yourself must see how well assured I felt My father was alone .</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . And so you hoped To find him — shall I read your answer thus ?</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Nay , press her not . Your Highness does her wrong , So harshly to construe her simpleness . My daughter and myself are one , and both Will own an equal pleasure if you bide .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">DON JOHN ( seating himself ) .</l>
     <l n="2">You chain me with kind words .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>MARIA . My father , sir , Hath surely told you our delight and marvel At the enchantments of your feast . For me The night was brief , rich , beautiful , and strange As a bright dream .</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . I will gainsay you not . A beauteous soul can shed her proper glory On mean surroundings . I have likewise dreamed , Nor am I yet awake . This morn hath been A feast for mind and eye . Yon shepherd-prince , Whom angels visit in his sleep , shall crown Your father 's brow with a still fresher laurel , And link in equal fame the Spanish artist With the Lord 's chosen prophet .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . That may be , For in the form of that wayfarer I drew myself . So have I slept beneath The naked heavens , pillowed by a stone , With no more shelter than the wind-stirred branches , While the thick dews of our Valencian nights Drenched my rude weeds , and chilled through blood and bone . Yet to me also were the heavens revealed , And angels visited my dreams .</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . How strange That you , dear masters , standing on the crown Of a long life 's continuous ascent , Should backward glance unto such dark beginnings .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Obscure are all beginnings . Yet I muse With pleasing pain on those fierce years of struggle . They were to me my birthright ; all the vigor , The burning passion , the unflinching truth , My later pencil gained , I gleaned from them . I prized them . I reclaimed their ragged freedom , Rather than hold my seat , a liveried slave , At the rich board of my Lord Cardinal . A palace was a prison till I reared Mine own . But now my child 's heart I would pierce Sooner than see it bear the least of ills , Such as I then endured .</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . Donna Maria May smile , sir , at your threat ; she is in a pleasance , Where no rude breezes blow , no shadow falls Darker than that of cool and fragrant leaves . Yea , were it otherwise — had you not reaped The fruit of your own works , she had not suffered . Your children are Spain 's children .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Sir , that word Is the most grateful you have spoken yet . Why are thou silent , daughter ?</p>

   <p>DON JOHN . Thanks . To-morrow noon . Farewell , signora . [ Exit DON JOHN . ]</p>
   <p>RIBERA . What ails you , daughter ? You forget yourself . Your tongue cleaves to your mouth . You sit and muse , A statue of white silence . Twice to-day You have deeply vexed me . Go not thus again Across the street with that light child , Fiametta . Faith , you were closely muffled . What was this — This tell-tale auburn curl that rippled down Over the black mantilla ? Were I harsh , Suspicious , jealous , fearful , prone to wrath , Or anything of all that I am not , I should have deemed it no mere negligence , But a bold token .</p>
   <p>MARIA . Father you make me quail . Why do you threat me with such evil eyes ? Would they could read my heart !</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Elude me not . Whom have you met beside the Prince this morn ? Who saw you pass ? Whom have you spoken with ?</p>
   <p>MARIA . For God 's sake , father , what strange thoughts are these ? With none , with none ! Beside the Prince , you say ? Why even him I saw not , as you know . I hastened with veiled eyes cast on the ground , Swathed in my mantle still , I told my beads , And in like manner hasted home to you .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Well , it may pass ; but henceforth say thy matins In thine own room . I know what vague cloud Obscures my sight and weighs upon my brain . I am very weary . Luca , follow me . [ Exeunt RIBERA and LUCA . ]</p>
   <p>MARIA . Poor father ! Dimly he perceives some trouble Within the threatening air . Thank heaven , I calmed him , Yet I spake truth . What could have roused so soon His quick suspicion ? Did Fiametta see The wary page slip in my hand the missive , As we came forth again ? Nay , even so , My father hath not spoken with her since . Sure he knows naught ; ‘ t is but my foolish fear Makes monsters out of shadows . I may read The priceless lines and grave them on my heart . [ She draws from her bosom a letter , reads it , and presses it to her lips . ] He loves me , yes , he loves me ! Oh , my God , This awful joy in mine own breast is love ! To-night he will await me in our garden . Oh , for a word , a pressure of the hand ! I fly , my prince , at thy most dear behest ! [ Exit . ]</p>

     <l n="1">A room in DON TOMMASO 'S HOUSE . DON TOMMASO and ANNICCA .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>DON TOMMASO . Truly , you wrong your sister ; she is young , Heedless , and wilful , that is all ; a touch Of the Ribera 's spirit fired the lass . Don John was but her weapon of revenge Against the malice of our haughty matrons , Who hurled this icy shafts of scorn from heights Of dignity upon the artist 's daughter .</p>
   <p>ANNICCA . I cannot think with you . In her demeanor , Her kindled cheek , her melting eye , was more Than sly revenge or cautious policy . If that was art , it overreached itself . Ere the night ended , I had blushed to see Slighting regards cast on my father 's child , And hear her name and his tossed lightly round .</p>
   <p>DON TOMMASO . Could you not read in such disparagement The envy of small natures ?</p>
   <p>ANNICCA . I had as lief Maria were to dance the tarantella Upon the quay at noonday , as to see her Gazed at again with such insulting homage .</p>
   <p>DON TOMMASO . You are too strict ; your baseless apprehensions Wrong her far more than strangers ’ jests .</p>
   <p>ANNICCA . Not so ; My timely fears prevent a greater ill And work no harm , since they shall be imparted Only to him who hath the power to quell them , Dissolving them to air — my father .</p>
   <p>DON TOMMASO . How ! You surely will not rouse his fatal wrath ? Annicca , listen : if your doubts were true , He whose fierce love guards her with sleepless eyes , More like the passion of some wild , dumb creature , With prowling jealousy and deadly spring , Forth leaping at the first approach of ill , Than the calm tenderness of human fathers ; He surely had been keen to scent the danger . I saw him at the ball — as is his wont , He mingled not among the revellers , But like her shadow played the spy on her .</p>
   <p>ANNICCA . A word would stir less deeply than you dread .</p>
   <p>DON TOMMASO . Ah , there you err ; he knows no middle term . At once he would accept as fact the worst Of your imaginings ; his rage would smite All near him , and rebound upon himself ; For , as I learn , Don John brings royal orders For the Queen 's gallery ; he would dismiss The Prince as roughly as a begging artist . Make no such breach just now betwixt the court And our own kindred .</p>
   <p>ANNICCA . Be it so , Tommaso . I will do naught in haste .</p>
   <p>DON TOMMASO . Watch thou and wait . A slight reproof might now suffice the child , Tame as a bird unto a gentle voice .</p>
   <p>ANNICCA . My mind misgives me ; yet will I find patience .</p>

     <l n="1">Night in RIBERA 'S Garden . DON JOHN alone .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>DON JOHN . In any less than she , so swift a passion , So unreserved , so reckless , had repelled . In her ‘ t is godlike . Our mutual love Was born full-grown , as we gazed each on each . Nay , ‘ t was not born , but like a thing eternal , It WAS ere we had consciousness thereof ; No growth of slow development , but perfect From the beginning , neither doomed to end . Her garden breathes her own warm , southern beauty , Glowing with dewy and voluptuous bloom . Here I am happy — happy to dream and wait In rich security of bliss . I know How brief an interval divides us now . She hastes to meet me with no less impatience Than mine to clasp her in my arms , to press Heart unto heart , and see the love within The unfathomable depths of her great eyes . She comes . Maria !</p>
   <p>Enter MARIA , half timid , half joyous .</p>
   <p>MARIA . My lord ! you have been waiting ?</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . Darling , not long ; ‘ t was but my restless love That drove me here before the promised hour . So were I well content to wait through ages Upon the threshold of a joy like this , Knowing the gates of heaven might ope to me At any moment .</p>
   <p>MARIA . Your love is less than mine , For I have counted every tedious minute Since our last meeting .</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . I had rather speak Less than the truth to have you chide me thus ; Yet if you enter in the lists with me , Faith match with faith , and loyal heart with heart , I warrant you , the jealous god of love , Who spies us from yon pomegranate bush , Would crown me victor .</p>
   <p>MARIA . Why should we compete ? Who could decide betwixt two equal truths , Two perfect faiths ?</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . The worship of my life Will be slight payment for your boundless trust . Look we nor forth nor back , are we not happy ? Heaven smiles above our heads with all her stars . The envious day forced us apart , the wing Of obscure night protects and shelters us . Now like a pure , night-blooming flower , puts forth The perfect blossom of our love . Oh , lean Thy royal head upon my breast ; assure me That this unheard-of bliss is no fond dream . Cling to me , darling , till thy love 's dear burden Take root about my heart-strings .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">MARIA ( after a pause ) .</l>
     <l n="2">Did you not hear</l>
     <l n="3">A sound , a cry ? Oh , God ! was it my father ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>DON JOHN . Naught save the beating of our hearts I heard . Be calm , my love ; the very air is hushed . Listen , the tinkle of the fountain yonder ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The sleepy stir of leaves , the querulous pipe</l>
     <l n="2">Of some far bird — no more .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>MARIA . I heard , I heard ! A rude voice called me . Wherefore did it come To snatch me from that dream of restful love ? Oh , Juan , you will save me , you will help ,— Tell me you will — I have lost all for you !</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . To-morrow you will laugh at fears like these . You have lost naught — you have but won my love . Lose not your faith in that — your shield and weapon .</p>
   <p>MARIA . I tremble still in every limb . Good-night , I must be gone . To-morrow when you come , Be wary with my father ; he is fierce In love and hatred . Listen and look , my lord . If one dared say to me but yester-morn That I would meet at night a stranger youth In mine own garden , talk with him of love , And hint a thought against the Spagnoletto , I had smitten with this bauble such a one . [ Pointing to a jewelled poniard in her belt . ] Kiss me , my Juan , once again . Good-night . [ Exit MARIA . ]</p>

     <l n="2">ANNICCA .</l>
     <l n="3">Has he come often ?</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>RIBERA . Nay , I caught the trick Of his fair face in some half-dozen sittings . His is a bold and shapely head — it pleased me . I like the lad ; the work upon his portrait Was pastime — ‘ t is already nigh complete .</p>
   <p>ANNICCA . And has Maria sat here while you worked ?</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">RIBERA ( sharply ) .</l>
     <l n="2">Why not ? What would'st thou say ? Speak , fret me not</l>
     <l n="3">With ticklish fears . Is she not by my side ,</l>
     <l n="4">For work or rest ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>ANNICCA . Surely , I meant no harm . Father , how quick you are ! I had but asked If she , being here , had seen the work progress , And found it his true counterpart .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Annicca , There is something in your thought you hold from me . Have the lewd , prying eyes , the slanderous mind Of public envy , spied herein some mischief ? What hast thou heard ? By heaven , if one foul word Have darkened the fair fame of my white dove , Naples shall rue it . Let them not forget The chapel of Saint Januarius !</p>

     <l n="6">RIBERA ( seating himself ) .</l>
     <l n="7">I am foolish , hasty ; but it makes me mad .</l>
     <l n="8">Listen to me . Here sits the Prince before me ;</l>
     <l n="9">We talk , we laugh . We have discussed all themes ,</l>
     <l n="10">From the great Angelo 's divinity ,</l>
     <l n="11">Down to the pest of flies that fret us here</l>
     <l n="12">At the day 's hottest . Sometimes he will pace</l>
     <l n="13">The studio — such young blood is seldom still .</l>
     <l n="14">He brought me once his mandoline , and drew</l>
     <l n="15">Eloquent music thence . I study thus</l>
     <l n="16">The changeful play of soul . I catch the spirit</l>
     <l n="17">Behind the veil , and burn it on the plate .</l>
     <l n="18">Maria comes and goes — will sit awhile</l>
     <l n="19">Over her broidery , then will haste away</l>
     <l n="20">And serve us with a dish of golden fruit .</l>
     <l n="21">That is for me ; she knows the sweet , cool juice ,</l>
     <l n="22">After long hours of work , refreshes me</l>
     <l n="23">More than strong wine . She meets his Royal Highness</l>
     <l n="24">As the Ribera 's child should meet a Prince —</l>
     <l n="25">Nor over bold , nor timid ; one would think</l>
     <l n="26">Their rank was equal , and that neither sprang</l>
     <l n="27">From less than royal lineage .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>ANNICCA . Why , I know it . Here is no need to excuse or justify . Speak rather of your work — is the plate finished ?</p>
   <p>RIBERA . So nigh , that were Don John to leave to-morrow , It might go with him .</p>
   <p>ANNICCA . What ! he leaves Naples ?</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Yea , but I know not when ; he seems to wait Momently , orders from his Majesty To travel onward .</p>

   <p>ANNICCA . I spake not , father . I regret with you The Prince should leave us ; you have more enjoyed His young companionship than any strangers These many years .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Well , well , enough of him . He hath a winning air — so far , so good . I know not that I place more trust in him Than in another . ‘ T is a lying world ; I am too old now to be duped or dazzled By fair externals .</p>
   <p>Enter MARIA , carrying a kirtle full of flowers .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>RIBERA . Truly , a gorgeous show ! Pink , yellow , crimson , white — which is the fairest ? Those with the deepest blush should best become you — Nay , they accord not with your hair 's red gold ; The white ones suit you best — pale , innocent , So flowers too can lie ! Is not that strange ? [ MARIA looks at him in mingled wonder and affright . He roughly brushes aside all the flowers upon the floors , than picks one up and carefully plucks it to pieces . ] I think not highly of your flowers , girl ; I have plucked this leaf ; it has no heart . See there ! [ He laughs contemptuously . ]</p>
   <p>MARIA . What have I done ? Alas ! what mean you ? Have you then lost your reason ?</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Nay , but found it . I , who was dull of wit , am keen at last . “ Don John is comely , ” and “ Don John is kind ; ” “ A wonderful musician is Don John , ” “ A princely artist ” — and then , meek of mien , You enter in his presence , modest , simple . And who beneath that kitten grace had spied The claws of mischief ? Who ! Why , all the world , Save the fond , wrinkled , hoary fool , thy father . Out , girl , for shame ! He will be here anon ; Hence to your room — he shall not find you here . Thank God , thank God ! no evil hath been wrought That may not be repaired . I have sat by At all your meetings . You shall have no more ; Myself will look to that . Away , away ! [ Exit Maria . ]</p>

     <l n="5">MARIA ( advancing ) .</l>
     <l n="6">You study late . I came to bid good-night .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>RIBERA . Poor child , thou must be weary . Thou art pale Still from thy swoon .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">MARIA ( with a forced laugh ) .</l>
     <l n="2">I had forgotten it .</l>
     <l n="3">Nay , I am well again .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>RIBERA . But I forget it not , Neither forgive myself . Well , it is past , Enough ! When the Prince left I sent for thee ; Thou wast still sleeping ?</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">MARIA ( with confusion ) .</l>
     <l n="2">Yes , I was outworn .</l>
     <l n="3">What didst thou wish of me ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>RIBERA . Merely to tell thee Don John leaves Naples . He expressed regret Most courteously that thou wast suffering . He had fain ordered us his parting thanks For our kind welcome — so he deigned to say . To-morrow he may steal a moment 's grace To see us both once more ; but this is doubtful , So he entrusted his farewells to me .</p>
   <p>MARIA . May peace go with him .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . We are alone — Are we not , darling ? Thanks for the calm content Wherewith thou biddest him farewell , to nestle Once more in mine embrace . Not long , I feel , May these old horny eyes be blest with sight Of thy full-flowering grace , these wrinkled lips Be pressed against thy brow . I am no more What I have been ; at times both hand and brain Refuse their task . Myself will follow soon — The better part of me already dead . So the worm claims us by slow torture , child . Thou'lt bear with me , if as to-day I wrong Thy gentle spirit ?</p>
   <p>MARIA . Father , no more , no more ! You break my heart .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Mine angel-child , weep not So bitterly . I thought not thus to move thee . Still thou art overwrought . I would have asked At last a promise of thee . I am selfish , But I would sleep less startingly o'nights , And bear a calmer soul by day , were I secure That thou wilt bide with me until the end . [ A pause . ] To-night I will not press thee . Thou art weary ; Thy nerves have scarce regained their tension yet ; But from thy deep emotion I can see ‘ T will cost thee less than I have feared . To-morrow We will talk of this again .</p>
   <p>MARIA . To-morrow !</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Now , Good-night . ‘ T is time thou shouldst be sleeping .</p>
   <p>MARIA . Father , I cannot leave thee ! Every word of thine Gnaws like a burning coal my sore , soft heart . What ! thou shalt suffer , and thine own Maria Will leave thee daughterless , uncomforted ? What ! thou shalt weep , and other eyes than mine Shall see the Spagnoletto 's spirit broken ?</p>
   <p>RIBERA . There , there , poor child ! Look up , cling not so wildly About my neck . Thou art too finely touched , If thus the faint foreshadow of a grief Can overcome thee . Listen ? What was that ?</p>
   <p>MARIA ( starts up , shudders violently , and , all at once , masters her emotion ) . Why , I heard nothing , father .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Yes , a sound Of footsteps , and a stifled call . [ He goes toward the casement . MARIA tries to detain him . ]</p>
   <p>MARIA . Dear father , Surely ‘ t was naught . Your ears deceive you . The wind is rising , and you heard the leaves Rustling together .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Nay , I will look forth . [ He opens the casement and looks out in silence . MARIA stands behind him , with her hands clasped in an agony of fear . ]</p>

     <l n="12">Like the blown leaves without .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>MARIA . I am oppressed By the same stormy influence . Thou knowest I dread the thunder .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Thou , who art safely housed , Why shouldst thou dread it ? Try to sleep , my darling ; Forget the terror of the tempest ; morn Will break again in sunshine .</p>
   <p>MARIA . Father , say You love me and you trust me once again , Before I bid good-night .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . If it will calm thee , I love thee and I trust thee . Thou art to me My genius — thou , the breathing image still Of thy saint-mother , whom the angels guard . Even as thou standest now , vested in white , With glowing eyes and pale , unsmiling face , I see her as she stood the day her heart Went forth from home and kin to bless the stranger Who craved her father 's alms .</p>
   <p>MARIA . Thanks , thanks . Good-night . God bless us through these wild , dark hours .</p>
   <p>RIBERA . Good-night .</p>

    <head>SCENE II .</head>
    <head>RIBERA 'S garden . Half the sky illuminated by an over-clouded moon , the rest obscured by an approaching storm . Occasional thunder and lightning . On on side of the stage a summer-house open to the audience , on the other side the exterior of the dwelling . DON JOHN discovered waiting near the house . The door opens , and enter MARIA .</head>
     <l n="1">DON JOHN ( springing forward and embracing her ) .</l>
     <l n="2">At last ! at last !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>MARIA . Juan , beware ! My father 's fears , I cannot guess by whom or what , are roused . [ She extends her arms gropingly to embrace him . ] Oh , let me feel thee near me — I see naught . Follow me ; here our voices may be heard . [ She hastens towards the summer-house , leaning upon his arm , and sinks upon a seat . ] Have not slow ages passed with crowding woes Since we last met ! What have I not endured ! Oh , Juan , save me !</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . Dearest child , be calm . Thou art strangely overwrought . Speak not . Await Till this wild fear be past .</p>
   <p>MARIA . How great you are ! Your simple presence stills and comforts me . While you are here , the one thing real to me In all the universe is love .</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . And yet My love is here , if I be far or nigh . Is this the spirit of a soldier 's wife ? Nay , fiery courage , iron fortitude , That soul must own that dares to say , “ I love . ”</p>
   <p>MARIA . And I dare say it . I can bear the worst That envious fate may heap upon my head , If thou art with me , or for hope of thee .</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . Art sure of that ? Thou couldst not part from me , Even for thy father 's sake ?</p>
   <p>MARIA . Talk you of parting ? For God 's sake , what is this ? You love no more ?</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . Rather I love so truly that I shrink From asking thee to share a soldier 's fate . I tremble to uproot so fine a flower From its dear native earth . I —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">MARIA ( putting her hand on his lips ) .</l>
     <l n="2">Hush , no more !</l>
     <l n="3">I need no preparation more than this ,</l>
     <l n="4">Your mere request .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>DON JOHN . There spake my heroine . The King , my father , bids me to repair Unto Palermo .</p>
   <p>MARIA . Shall we sail to-night ?</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . My Princess ! Thou recoilest not from all Thou must endure , ere I can openly Claim thee my wife !</p>
   <p>MARIA . The pangs of purgatory Were lightly borne with such a heaven in view . I were content with one brief hour a day , Snatched from the toils of war and thy high duties , To gaze on thy dear face — to feel thy hand , Even as now a stay and a caress .</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . Angel , I have no thanks . May God forget me When I forget this hour ! So , thou art firm — Ready this night to leave thy home , thy kin , Thy father ?</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">MARIA ( solemnly ) .</l>
     <l n="2">I am ready and resolved .</l>
     <l n="3">Yet judge me not so lightly as to deem</l>
     <l n="4">I say this with no pang . My love were naught ,</l>
     <l n="5">Could I withdraw it painlessly at once</l>
     <l n="6">From him round whose colossal strength the tendrils</l>
     <l n="7">Of mine own baby heart were taught to twine .</l>
     <l n="8">I speak not now as one who swerves or shrinks ,</l>
     <l n="9">But merely , dear , to show thee what sharp tortures</l>
     <l n="10">I , nowise blind , but with deliberate soul ,</l>
     <l n="11">Embrace for thee .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>DON JOHN . How can I doubt the anguish So rude a snapping of all ties must smite Thy tender heart withal ? Yet , dwell we not On the brief pain , but on the enduring joys . If Ribera 's love be all thou deemest , He will forgive thy secret flight , thy —</p>
   <p>MARIA . Secret ! May I not bid farewell ? May I not tell him Where we are bound ? How soon he may have hope To hear from me — to welcome me , thy Princess ? I dare not leave him without hope .</p>
   <p>DON JOHN . My child , Thou art mad ! We must be secret as the grave , Else are we both undone . I have given out That I depart in princely state to-morrow . Far from the quay a bark awaiteth us . I know my man . Shrouded by careful night , We will set secret sail for Sicily . Once in Palermo , thou mayst write thy father — Sue for his pardon — tell him that , ere long , When I have won by cautious policy King Philip 's favor , thou shalt be proclaimed Princess of Austria .</p>
   <p>MARIA ( who has hung upon his words with trembling excitement , covers her face with her hands , and bursts into tears ) . I cannot ! no ! I cannot !</p>

   <p>RIBERA . How laughingly the clear sun shines to-day On storm-drenched green , and cool , far-glittering seas ! When she comes in to greet me , she will blush For last night 's terrors . How she crouched and shuddered At the mere thought of the wild war without ! Poor , clinging women 's souls , what need is theirs Of our protecting love ! Yet even on me The shadow of the storm-cloud seemed to breed . Through my vexed sleep I heard the thunder roll ; My dreams were ugly — Well , all that is past ; To-day my spirit is renewed . ‘ T is long Since I have felt so fresh . [ He seats himself before his easel and takes up his brush and palette , but holds them idly in his hand . ] Strange , she still sleeps ! The hour is past when she is wont to come To bless me with the kiss of virgin love . Mayhap ‘ t was fever in her eyes last night Gave them so wild a glance , so bright a lustre .

We will treat as King with King . HE shall be stripped of rank and name and wealth , Degraded , lopped from off the fellowship Of Christians like a rotten limb , proclaimed The bastard that he is .

   <p>GENTLEMAN . Hail and farewell so soon , Friend dreamer ? I will lay a goodly sum The news that flies like fire from tongue to tongue Hath not yet warmed thine ear .</p>
   <p>LORENZO . What 's that ? I lay A sum as fair thy news is some dry tale Of courtly gossip , touching me as nigh As the dissensions of the antipodes .</p>
   <p>GENTLEMAN . Done for a hundred florins ! In the night , ‘ Midst the wild storm whose roar must have invaded Even thy leaden sleep , Prince John left Naples . We should have had a pageant here to-day , A royal exit , floral arches thrown From house to house in all the streets he passed , Music and guard of honor , homage fitting The son of Philip — but the bird has flown .</p>
   <p>LORENZO . So ! I regret our busy citizens , Who sun themselves day-long upon the quays , Should be deprived of such a festival . Your wager 's lost — how am I moved by this ?</p>
   <p>GENTLEMAN . Hark to the end . ‘ T would move all men whose veins Flow not clear water . He hath carried off The Rose of Naples .</p>
   <p>LORENZO . What wouldst thou say ? Speak out ! In God 's name , who hath followed him ?</p>
   <p>GENTLEMAN . Ah , thou'rt roused . Thy master hath been robbed — the Spagnoletto — Maria of the Golden Locks — his daughter .</p>
   <p>LORENZO . How is this known ? ‘ T is a foul slander forged By desperate malice . What ! in the night , you say ?— She whose bright name was clean as gold , whose heart Shone a fixed star of loyal love and duty Beside her father 's glory ! This coarse lie Denies itself . I will go seek the master , And if this very noon she walk not forth , Led by the Spagnoletto , through the streets , To blind the dazed eyes of her slanderers ,— I am your debtor for a hundred florins .</p>
   <p>GENTLEMAN . Your faith in womanhood becomes you , sir . ( Aside . ) A beggar 's child the mistress of a Prince ; Humph ! there be some might think the weight of scandal Lay on the other side . ( To Lorenzo . ) You need not forth To seek her father . See , he comes , alone . I will not meddle in the broil . Farewell ! [ Exit Gentleman . ]</p>

I am your friend , your pupil ; Let me but guide my reverend master home , In token of the grateful memory Wherein I hold his guidance of my mind Up the steep paths of art .

   <p>RIBERA . I crave your pardon If I have answered roughly , Sir Lorenzo . My thoughts were far away — I failed to know you — I have had trouble , sir . You do remind me , I had forgot my hat ; that is a trifle , Yet now I feel the loss . What slaves are we To circumstance ! One who is wont to cover For fashion or for warmth his pate , goes forth Bareheaded , and the sun will seem to smite The shrinking spot , the breeze will make him shiver , And yet our hatless beggars heed them not . We are the fools of habit .</p>

Well , I will go with thee . But , hark thee , lad ; A word first in thine ear . ‘ T is a grim secret ; Whisper it not in Naples ; I but tell thee , Lest thou should fancy I had lost my wits . My daughter hath deserted me — hath fled From Naples with a bastard . Thou hast seen her , Maria-Rosa — thou must remember her ; She , whom I painted as Madonna once . She had fair hair and Spanish eyes . When was it ? I came forth thinking I might meet with her And find all this a dream — a foolish thought ! I am very weary . ( Yawning . ) I have walked and walked For hours . How far , sir , stand we from the Strada Nardo ? I live there , nigh Saint Francis ’ church .</p>
   <p>LORENZO . Why , ‘ t is hard by ; a stone 's throw from this square . So , lean on me — you are not well . This way . Pluck up good heart , sir ; we shall soon be there . [ Exeunt . ]</p>

   <p>ANNICCA . His heavy sleep still lasts . Despite the words Of the physician , I can cast not off That ghastly fear . Albeit he owned no drugs , This deathlike slumber , this deep breathing slow , His livid pallor makes me dread each moment His weary pulse will cease . This is the end , And from the first I knew it . The worst evil My warning tongue had wrought were joy to this . No heavier curse could I invoke on her Than that she see him in her dreams , her thoughts , As he is now . I could no longer bear it ; I have fled hither from his couch to breathe — To quicken my spent courage for the end . I cannot pray — my heart is full of curses . He sleeps ; he rests . What better could I wish For his rent heart , his stunned , unbalanced brain , Than sleep to be eternally prolonged ?</p>

   <p>ANNICCA . Heaven be praised ! [ Exit hastily . ]</p>
   <p>FIAMETTA . Would I had followed my young mistress ! Here I creep about like a scared , guilty thing , And fancy at each moment they will guess ‘ T was I who led her to the hut . I will confess , If any sin there be , to Father Clement , And buy indulgence with her golden chain . ‘ T would burn my throat , the master 's rolling eyes Would haunt me ever , if I went to wear it . So , all will yet be well . [ Exit . ]</p>

   <p>RIBERA . Child , I was not weary . There was some cloud pressed here ( pointing to his forehead ) but that is past , I have no pain nor any sense of ill. Now , while my brain is clear , I have a word To speak . I think not I have been to thee , Nor to that other one , an unkind father . I do not now remember any act , Or any word of mine , could cause thee grief . But I am old — perchance my memory Deceives in this ? Speak ! Am I right , Annicca ?</p>

   <p>RIBERA . Why , so I thought . Since it appears the guerdon of such goodness Is treachery , abandonment , disgrace , I here renounce my fatherhood . No child Will I acknowledge mine . Thou art a wife ; Thy duty is thy husband 's . When Antonio Returns from Seville , tell him that his father Is long since dead . Henceforward I will own No kin , no home , no tie . I will away , To-morrow morn , and live an anchorite . One thing ye cannot rob me of — my work . My name shall still outsoar these low , mirk vapors — Not the Ribera , stained with sin and shame , As she hath left it , but the Spagnoletto . My glory is mine own . I have done with it , But I bequeath it to my country . Now I will make friends with beasts — they 'll prove less savage Than she that was my daughter . I have spoken For the last time that word . Thee I curse not ; Thou hast not set thy heel upon my heart ; But yet I will not bless thee . Go . Good-night .</p>

   <p>RIBERA . Away ! I know thee . Thou art one With her who duped me with like words last night . Then I believed ; but now my sense is closed , My heart is dead as stone . I cast thee forth . By heaven , I own thee not ! Thou dost forget I am the Spagnoletto . Away , I say , Or ere I strike thee . [ He threatens her . ]</p>
   <p>ANNICCA . Woe is me ! Help , help ! [ Exit . ]</p>
   <p>RIBERA . So , the last link is snapt . Had I not steeled My heart , I fain had kissed her farewell . ‘ T is better so . I leave my work unfinished . Could I arise each day to face this spectre , Or sleep with it at night ?— to yearn for her Even while I curse her ? No ! The dead remain Sacred and sweet in our remembrance still ; They seem not to have left us ; they abide And linger nigh us in the viewless air . The fallen , the guilty , must be rooted out From heart and thought and memory . With them No hope of blest reunion ; they must be As though they had not been ; their spoken name Cuts like a knife . When I essay to think Of what hath passed to-day , my sick brain reels . The letter I remember , but all since Floats in a mist of horror , and I grasp No actual form . Did I not wander forth ? A mob surrounded me . All Naples knew My downfall , and the street was paved with eyes That stared into my soul . Then friendly hands Guided me hither . When I woke , I felt As though a stone had rolled from off my brain . But still this nightmare bides the truth . I know They watch me , they suspect me . I will wait Till the whole household sleep , and then steal forth , Nor unavenged return .</p>

Thou knowest him . Have I not cause to mourn Uncomforted , that he , the first of fathers , Self-murdered — nay , child-murdered — Oh , Tommaso , I would fare barefoot to the ends of the earth To look again upon his living face , See in his eyes the light of love restored — Not blasting me with lightnings as before — To kneel to him , to solace him , to win For mine own head , yoked in my sister 's curse The blessing he refused me .</p>

I deemed her spent , had not the soft breast heaved As gently as a babe 's and even in dreams Two crystal drops oozed from her swollen lids , And trickled down her cheeks . Her grief sleeps not , Although the fragile body craves its rest .</p>
   <p>ABBESS . Poor child ! I fear she hath sore need of prayer . Hath she yet spoken ?</p>
   <p>LAY-SISTER . Only such scant words Of thanks or answer as our proffered service Or questionings demand . When we are silent , Even if she wake , she seemeth unaware Of any presence . She will sit and wail , Rocking upon the ground , with dull , wide eyes , Wherefrom the streaming tears unceasing course ; The only sound that then escapes her lips Is , “ Father , Father ! ” in such piteous strain As though her rent heart bled to utter it .</p>
   <p>ABBESS . Still she abides then by her first request To take the black veil and its vows to-morrow ?</p>
   <p>LAY-SISTER . Yea , to that purpose desperately she clings . This evening , if she rouse , she makes confession . Even now a holy friar waits without , Fra Bruno , of the order of Carthusians , Beyond Palermo .</p>

    <head>SCENE III .</head>
    <head>A Cell in the Nunnery . MARIA discovered asleep on a straw pallet . She starts suddenly from her sleep with a little cry , half rises and remains seated on her pallet .</head>
    <head>MARIA . Oh , that wild dream ! My weary bones still ache With the fierce pain ; they wrenched me limb from limb . Thou hadst full cause , my father . But thou , Juan , What was my sin to thee , save too much love ? Oh , would to God my back were crooked with age , My smooth cheek seamed with wrinkles , my bright hair Hoary with years , and my quick blood impeded By sluggish torpor , so were I near the end Of woes that seem eternal ! I am strong — Death will not rescue me . Within my veins I feel the vigorous pulses of young life , Refusing my release . My heart at times Rebels against the habit of despair , And , ere I am aware , has wandered back , Among forbidden paths . What prayer , what penance , Will shrive me clean before the sight of heaven ? My hands are black with parricide . Why else Should his dead face arise three nights before me , Bleached , ghastly , dripping as of one that 's drowned , To freeze my heart with horror ? Christ , have mercy ! [ She covers her face with her hands in an agony of despair . ]</head>
     <l n="1">Enter a MONK .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>THE MONK . May peace be in this place ! [ MARIA shudders violently at the sound of his voice ; looks up and sees the MONK with bent head , and hands partially extended , as one who invokes a blessing . She rises , falls at his feet , and takes the hem of his skirt between her hands , pressing it to he lips . ]</p>
   <p>MARIA . Welcome , thrice welcome ! Bid me not rise , nor bless me with pure hands . Ask not to see my face . Here let me lie , Kissing the dust — a cast-away , a trait'ress , A murderess , a parricide !</p>
   <p>MONK . Accursed With all Hell 's curses is the crime thou nam'st ! What devil moved thee ? Who and whence art thou , That wear'st the form of woman , though thou lack'st The heart of the she-wolf ? Who was thy parent , What fiend of torture , that thine impious hands Should quench the living source of thine own life ?</p>
   <p>MARIA . Spare me ! oh , spare me ! Nay , my hands are clean . He was the first , best , noblest among men . I was his light , his soul , his breath of life . These I withdrew from him , and made his days A darkness . Yet , perchance he is not dead , And blood and tears may wash away my guilt . Oh , tell me there is hope , though it gleam far — One solitary ray , one steadfast spark , Beyond a million years of purgatory ! My burning soul thirsts for the dewy balm Of comfortable grace . One word , one word , Or ere I perish of despair !</p>
   <p>MONK . What word ? The one wherewith thou bad'st thy father hope ? What though he be not dead ? Is breathing life ? Hast thou not murdered him in spirit ? dealt The death-blow to his heart ? Cheat not thy soul With empty dreams — thy God hath judged ye guilty !</p>
   <p>MARIA . Have pity , father ! Let me tell thee all . Thou , cloistered , holy and austere , know'st not My glittering temptations . My betrayer Was of an angel 's aspect . His were all gifts , All grace , all seeming virtue . I was plunged , Deaf , dumb , and blind , and hand-bound in the deep . If a poor drowning creature craved thine aid , Thou wouldst not spurn it . Such a one am I , And all the waves roll over me . Wrest me from my doom ! Say not that I am lost !</p>
   <p>MONK . I can but say What the just Spirit prompts . Myself am naught To pardon or condemn . The sin is sinned ; The fruit forbid is tasted , yea , and pressed Of its last honeyed juices . Wilt thou now Escape the after-bitterness with prayers , Scourgings , and wringings of the hands ? Shall these Undo what has been done ?— make whole the heart Thy crime hath snapt in twain ?— restore the wits Thy sin hath scattered ? No ! Thy punishment Is huge as thine offence . Death shall not help , Neither shall pious life wash out the stain . Living thou'rt doomed , and dead , thou shalt be lost , Beyond salvation .</p>

   <p>RIBERA . Thou know'st me not . I am not what I was . My outward shape remains unchanged ; these eyes , Now gloating on thine anguish , are the same That wept to see a shadow cross thy brow ; These ears , that drink the music of thy groans , Shrank from thy lightest sigh of melancholy . Thou think'st to find the father in me still ? Thy parricidal hands have murdered him — Thou shalt not find a man . I am the spirit Of blind revenge — a brute , unswerving force . What deemest thou hath bound me unto life ? Ambition , pleasure , or the sense of fear ? What , but the sure hope of this fierce , glad hour , That I might track thee down to this — might see Thy tortured body writhe beneath my feet , And blast thy stricken spirit with my curse ?</p>
