    <head>MAY .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">O love , this morn when the sweet nightingale</l>
     <l n="2">Had so long finished all he had to say ,</l>
     <l n="3">That thou hadst slept , and sleep had told his tale ;</l>
     <l n="4">And midst a peaceful dream had stolen away</l>
     <l n="5">In fragrant dawning of the first of May ,</l>
     <l n="6">Didst thou see aught ? didst thou hear voices sing</l>
     <l n="7">Ere to the risen sun the bells ‘ gan ring ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">For then methought the Lord of Love went by</l>
     <l n="9">To take possession of his flowery throne ,</l>
     <l n="10">Ringed round with maids , and youths , and minstrelsy ;</l>
     <l n="11">A little while I sighed to find him gone ,</l>
     <l n="12">A little while the dawning was alone ,</l>
     <l n="13">And the light gathered ; then I held my breath ,</l>
     <l n="14">And shuddered at the sight of Eld and Death .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">Alas ! Love passed me in the twilight dun ,</l>
     <l n="16">His music hushed the wakening ousel 's song ;</l>
     <l n="17">But on these twain shone out the golden sun ,</l>
     <l n="18">And o'er their heads the brown bird 's tune was strong ,</l>
     <l n="19">As shivering , twixt the trees they stole along ;</l>
     <l n="20">None noted aught their noiseless passing by ,</l>
     <l n="21">The world had quite forgotten it must die .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="22">Now must these men be glad a little while</l>
     <l n="23">That they had lived to see May once more smile</l>
     <l n="24">Upon the earth ; wherefore , as men who know</l>
     <l n="25">How fast the bad days and the good days go ,</l>
     <l n="26">They gathered at the feast : the fair abode</l>
     <l n="27">Wherein they sat , o'erlooked , across the road</l>
     <l n="28">Unhedged green meads , which willowy streams passed through ,</l>
     <l n="29">And on that morn , before the fresh May dew</l>
     <l n="30">Had dried upon the sunniest spot of grass ,</l>
     <l n="31">From bush to bush did youths and maidens pass</l>
     <l n="32">In raiment meet for May apparelled ,</l>
     <l n="33">Gathering the milk-white blossoms and the red ;</l>
     <l n="34">And now , with noon long past , and that bright day</l>
     <l n="35">Growing aweary , on the sunny way</l>
     <l n="36">They wandered , crowned with flowers , and loitering ,</l>
     <l n="37">And weary , yet were fresh enough to sing</l>
     <l n="38">The carols of the morn , and pensive , still</l>
     <l n="39">Had cast away their doubt of death and ill ,</l>
     <l n="40">And flushed with love , no more grew red with shame .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="41">So to the elders as they sat , there came ,</l>
     <l n="42">With scent of flowers , the murmur of that folk</l>
     <l n="43">Wherethrough from time to time a song outbroke ,</l>
     <l n="44">Till scarce they thought about the story due ;</l>
     <l n="45">Yet , when anigh to sun-setting it grew ,</l>
     <l n="46">A book upon the board an elder laid ,</l>
     <l n="47">And turning from the open window said ,</l>
     <l n="48">“ Too fair a tale the lovely time doth ask ,</l>
     <l n="49">For this of mine to be an easy task ,</l>
     <l n="50">Yet in what words soever this is writ ,</l>
     <l n="51">As for the matter , I dare say of it</l>
     <l n="52">That it is lovely as the lovely May ;</l>
     <l n="53">Pass then the manner , since the learned say</l>
     <l n="54">No written record was there of the tale ,</l>
     <l n="55">Ere we from our fair land of Greece set sail ;</l>
     <l n="56">How this may be I know not , this I know</l>
     <l n="57">That such-like tales the wind would seem to blow</l>
     <l n="58">From place to place , e'en as the feathery seed</l>
     <l n="59">Is borne across the sea to help the need</l>
     <l n="60">Of barren isles ; so , sirs , from seed thus sown ,</l>
     <l n="61">This flower , a gift from other lands has grown .</l>

    <head>THE STORY OF CUPID AND PSYCHE .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Psyche , a king 's daughter , by her exceeding beauty caused the people to forget Venus ; therefore the goddess would fain have destroyed her : nevertheless she became the bride of Love , yet in an unhappy moment lost him by her own fault , and wandering through the world suffered many evils at the hands of Venus , for whom she must accomplish fearful tasks . But the gods and all nature helped her , and in process of time she was reunited to Love , forgiven by Venus , and made immortal by the Father of gods and men .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In the Greek land of old there was a King</l>
     <l n="2">Happy in battle , rich in everything ;</l>
     <l n="3">Most rich in this , that he a daughter had</l>
     <l n="4">Whose beauty made the longing city glad .</l>
     <l n="5">She was so fair , that strangers from the sea</l>
     <l n="6">Just landed , in the temples thought that she</l>
     <l n="7">Was Venus visible to mortal eyes ,</l>
     <l n="8">New come from Cyprus for a world 's surprise .</l>
     <l n="9">She was so beautiful that had she stood</l>
     <l n="10">On windy Ida by the oaken wood ,</l>
     <l n="11">And bared her limbs to that bold shepherd 's gaze ,</l>
     <l n="12">Troy might have stood till now with happy days ;</l>
     <l n="13">And those three fairest , all have left the land</l>
     <l n="14">And left her with the apple in her hand .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="15">And Psyche is her name in stories old ,</l>
     <l n="16">As ever by our fathers we were told .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">All this beheld Queen Venus from her throne ,</l>
     <l n="18">And felt that she no longer was alone</l>
     <l n="19">In beauty , but , if only for a while ,</l>
     <l n="20">This maiden matched her god-enticing smile ;</l>
     <l n="21">Therefore , she wrought in such a wise , that she ,</l>
     <l n="22">If honoured as a goddess , certainly</l>
     <l n="23">Was dreaded as a goddess none the less ,</l>
     <l n="24">And midst her wealth , dwelt long in loneliness .</l>
     <l n="25">Two sisters had she , and men deemed them fair ,</l>
     <l n="26">But as King 's daughters might be anywhere ,</l>
     <l n="27">And these to men of name and great estate</l>
     <l n="28">Were wedded , while at home must Psyche wait .</l>
     <l n="29">The sons of kings before her silver feet</l>
     <l n="30">Still bowed , and sighed for her ; in measures sweet</l>
     <l n="31">The minstrels to the people sung her praise ,</l>
     <l n="32">Yet must she live a virgin all her days .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="33">So to Apollo 's fane her father sent ,</l>
     <l n="34">Seeking to know the dreadful Gods ’ intent ,</l>
     <l n="35">And therewith sent he goodly gifts of price</l>
     <l n="36">A silken veil , wrought with a paradise ,</l>
     <l n="37">Three golden bowls , set round with many a gem ,</l>
     <l n="38">Three silver robes , with gold in every hem ,</l>
     <l n="39">And a fair ivory image of the god</l>
     <l n="40">That underfoot a golden serpent trod ;</l>
     <l n="41">And when three lords with these were gone away ,</l>
     <l n="42">Nor could return until the fortieth day ,</l>
     <l n="43">Ill was the King at ease , and neither took</l>
     <l n="44">Joy in the chase , or in the pictured book</l>
     <l n="45">The skilled Athenian limner had just wrought ,</l>
     <l n="46">Nor in the golden cloths from India brought .</l>
     <l n="47">At last the day came for those lords ’ return ,</l>
     <l n="48">And then ‘ twixt hope and fear the King did burn ,</l>
     <l n="49">As on his throne with great pomp he was set ,</l>
     <l n="50">And by him Psyche , knowing not as yet</l>
     <l n="51">Why they had gone : thus waiting , at noontide</l>
     <l n="52">They in the palace heard a voice outside ,</l>
     <l n="53">And soon the messengers came hurrying ,</l>
     <l n="54">And with pale faces knelt before the King ,</l>
     <l n="55">And rent their clothes , and each man on his head</l>
     <l n="56">Cast dust , the while a trembling courtier read</l>
     <l n="57">This scroll , wherein the fearful answer lay ,</l>
     <l n="58">Whereat from every face joy passed away .</l>
    </lg>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE ORACLE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">O father of a most unhappy maid ,</l>
     <l n="2">O King , whom all the world henceforth shall know</l>
     <l n="3">As wretched among wretches , be afraid</l>
     <l n="4">To ask the gods thy misery to show ,</l>
     <l n="5">But if thou needs must hear it , to thy woe</l>
     <l n="6">Take back thy gifts to feast thine eyes upon ,</l>
     <l n="7">When thine own flesh and blood some beast hath won .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">“ For hear thy doom , a rugged rock there is</l>
     <l n="9">Set back a league from thine own palace fair ,</l>
     <l n="10">There leave the maid , that she may wait the kiss</l>
     <l n="11">Of the fell monster that doth harbour there :</l>
     <l n="12">This is the mate for whom her yellow hair</l>
     <l n="13">And tender limbs have been so fashioned ,</l>
     <l n="14">This is the pillow for her lovely head .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">“ O what an evil from thy loins shall spring ,</l>
     <l n="16">For all the world this monster overturns ,</l>
     <l n="17">He is the bane of every mortal thing ,</l>
     <l n="18">And this world ruined , still for more he yearns ;</l>
     <l n="19">A fire there goeth from his mouth that burns</l>
     <l n="20">Worse than the flame of Phlegethon the red —</l>
     <l n="21">To such a monster shall thy maid be wed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="22">“ And if thou sparest now to do this thing ,</l>
     <l n="23">I will destroy thee and thy land also ,</l>
     <l n="24">And of dead corpses shalt thou be the King ,</l>
     <l n="25">And stumbling through the dark land shalt thou go ,</l>
     <l n="26">Howling for second death to end thy woe ;</l>
     <l n="27">Live therefore as thou mayst and do my will ,</l>
     <l n="28">And be a King that men may envy still . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="29">What man was there , whose face changed not for grief</l>
     <l n="30">At hearing this ? Psyche , shrunk like the leaf</l>
     <l n="31">The autumn frost first touches on the tree ,</l>
     <l n="32">Stared round about with eyes that could not see ,</l>
     <l n="33">And muttered sounds from lips that said no word ,</l>
     <l n="34">And still within her ears the sentence heard</l>
     <l n="35">When all was said and silence fell on all</l>
     <l n="36">‘ Twixt marble columns and adorned wall .</l>
     <l n="37">Then spoke the King , bowed down with misery :</l>
     <l n="38">“ What help is left ! O daughter , let us die ,</l>
     <l n="39">Or else together fleeing from this land ,</l>
     <l n="40">From town to town go wandering hand in hand</l>
     <l n="41">Thou and I , daughter , till all men forget</l>
     <l n="42">That ever on a throne I have been set ,</l>
     <l n="43">And then , when houseless and disconsolate ,</l>
     <l n="44">We ask an alms before some city gate ,</l>
     <l n="45">The gods perchance a little gift may give ,</l>
     <l n="46">And suffer thee and me like beasts to live . ”</l>
     <l n="47">Then answered Psyche , through her bitter tears ,</l>
     <l n="48">“ Alas ! my father , I have known these years</l>
     <l n="49">That with some woe the gods have dowered me ,</l>
     <l n="50">And weighed ‘ gainst riches infelicity ;</l>
     <l n="51">Ill is it then against the gods to strive ;</l>
     <l n="52">Live on , O father , those that are alive</l>
     <l n="53">May still be happy ; would it profit me</l>
     <l n="54">To live awhile , and ere I died to see</l>
     <l n="55">Thee perish , and all folk who love me well ,</l>
     <l n="56">And then at last be dragged myself to hell</l>
     <l n="57">Cursed of all men ? nay , since all things must die ,</l>
     <l n="58">And I have dreamed not of eternity ,</l>
     <l n="59">Why weepest thou that I must die to-day ?</l>
     <l n="60">Why weepest thou ? cast thought of shame away .</l>
     <l n="61">The dead are not ashamed , they feel no pain ;</l>
     <l n="62">I have heard folk who spoke of death as gain —</l>
     <l n="63">And yet — ah , God , if I had been some maid ,</l>
     <l n="64">Toiling all day , and in the night-time laid</l>
     <l n="65">Asleep on rushes — had I only died</l>
     <l n="66">Before this sweet life I had fully tried ,</l>
     <l n="67">Upon that day when for my birth men sung ,</l>
     <l n="68">And o'er the feasting folk the sweet bells rung . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="69">And therewith she arose and gat away ,</l>
     <l n="70">And in her chamber , mourning long she lay ,</l>
     <l n="71">Thinking of all the days that might have been ,</l>
     <l n="72">And how that she was born to be a queen ,</l>
     <l n="73">The prize of some great conqueror of renown ,</l>
     <l n="74">The joy of many a country and fair town ,</l>
     <l n="75">The high desire of every prince and lord ,</l>
     <l n="76">One who could fright with careless smile or word</l>
     <l n="77">The hearts of heroes fearless in the war ,</l>
     <l n="78">The glory of the world , the leading-star</l>
     <l n="79">Unto all honour and all earthly fame —</l>
     <l n="80">— Round goes the wheel , and death and deadly shame</l>
     <l n="81">Shall be her lot , while yet of her men sing</l>
     <l n="82">Unwitting that the gods have done this thing .</l>
     <l n="83">Long time she lay there , while the sunbeams moved</l>
     <l n="84">Over her body through the flowers she loved ;</l>
     <l n="85">And in the eaves the sparrows chirped outside ,</l>
     <l n="86">Until for weariness she grew dry-eyed ,</l>
     <l n="87">And into an unhappy sleep she fell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="88">But of the luckless King now must we tell ,</l>
     <l n="89">Who sat devising means to ‘ scape that shame ,</l>
     <l n="90">Until the frightened people thronging came</l>
     <l n="91">About the palace , and drove back the guards ,</l>
     <l n="92">Making their way past all the gates and wards ;</l>
     <l n="93">And , putting chamberlains and marshals by ,</l>
     <l n="94">Surged round the very throne tumultuously .</l>
     <l n="95">Then knew the wretched King all folk had heard</l>
     <l n="96">The miserable sentence , and the word</l>
     <l n="97">The gods had spoken ; and from out his seat</l>
     <l n="98">He rose , and spoke in humble words , unmeet</l>
     <l n="99">For a great King , and prayed them give him grace ,</l>
     <l n="100">While ‘ twixt his words the tears ran down his face</l>
     <l n="101">On to his raiment stiff with golden thread .</l>
     <l n="102">But little heeded they the words he said ,</l>
     <l n="103">For very fear had made them pitiless ;</l>
     <l n="104">Nor cared they for the maid and her distress ,</l>
     <l n="105">But clashed their spears together and ‘ gan cry :</l>
     <l n="106">“ For one man 's daughter shall the people die ,</l>
     <l n="107">And this fair land become an empty name ,</l>
     <l n="108">Because thou art afraid to meet the shame</l>
     <l n="109">Wherewith the gods reward thy hidden sin ?</l>
     <l n="110">Nay , by their glory do us right herein ! ”</l>
     <l n="111">“ Ye are in haste to have a poor maid slain , ”</l>
     <l n="112">The King said ; “ but my will herein is vain ,</l>
     <l n="113">For ye are many , I one aged man :</l>
     <l n="114">Let one man speak , if for his shame he can . ”</l>
     <l n="115">Then stepped a sturdy dyer forth , who said ,—</l>
     <l n="116">“ Fear of the gods brings no shame , by my head .</l>
     <l n="117">Listen ; thy daughter we would have thee leave</l>
     <l n="118">Upon the fated mountain this same eve ;</l>
     <l n="119">And thither must she go right well arrayed</l>
     <l n="120">In marriage raiment , loose hair as a maid ,</l>
     <l n="121">And saffron veil , and with her shall there go</l>
     <l n="122">Fair maidens bearing torches , two and two ;</l>
     <l n="123">And minstrels , in such raiment as is meet</l>
     <l n="124">The god-ordainéd fearful spouse to greet .</l>
     <l n="125">So shalt thou save our wives and little ones ,</l>
     <l n="126">And something better than a heap of stones ,</l>
     <l n="127">Dwelt in by noisesome things , this town shall be ,</l>
     <l n="128">And thou thyself shalt keep thy sovereignty ;</l>
     <l n="129">But if thou wilt not do the thing I say ,</l>
     <l n="130">Then shalt thou live in bonds from this same day ,</l>
     <l n="131">And we will bear thy maid unto the hill ,</l>
     <l n="132">And from the dread gods save the city still . ”</l>
     <l n="133">Then loud they shouted at the words he said ,</l>
     <l n="134">And round the head of the unhappy maid ,</l>
     <l n="135">Dreaming uneasily of long-past joys ,</l>
     <l n="136">Floated the echo of that dreadful noise ,</l>
     <l n="137">And changed her dreams to dreams of misery .</l>
     <l n="138">But when the King knew that the thing must be ,</l>
     <l n="139">And that no help there was in this distress ,</l>
     <l n="140">He bade them have all things in readiness</l>
     <l n="141">To take the maiden out at sun-setting ,</l>
     <l n="142">And wed her to the unknown dreadful thing .</l>
     <l n="143">So through the palace passed with heavy cheer</l>
     <l n="144">Her women gathering the sad wedding gear ,</l>
     <l n="145">Who lingering long , yet at the last must go ,</l>
     <l n="146">To waken Psyche to her bitter woe .</l>
     <l n="147">So coming to her bower , they found her there ,</l>
     <l n="148">From head to foot rolled in her yellow hair ,</l>
     <l n="149">As in the saffron veil she should be soon</l>
     <l n="150">Betwixt the setting sun and rising moon ;</l>
     <l n="151">But when above her a pale maiden bent</l>
     <l n="152">And touched her , from her heart a sigh she sent ,</l>
     <l n="153">And waking , on their woeful faces stared ,</l>
     <l n="154">Sitting upright , with one white shoulder bared</l>
     <l n="155">By writhing on the bed in wretchedness .</l>
     <l n="156">Then suddenly remembering her distress ,</l>
     <l n="157">She bowed her head and ‘ gan to weep and wail</l>
     <l n="158">But let them wrap her in the bridal veil ,</l>
     <l n="159">And bind the sandals to her silver feet ,</l>
     <l n="160">And set the rose-wreath on her tresses sweet :</l>
     <l n="161">But spoke no word , yea , rather , wearily</l>
     <l n="162">Turned from the yearning face and pitying eye</l>
     <l n="163">Of any maid who seemed about to speak .</l>
     <l n="164">Now through the garden trees the sun ‘ gan break ,</l>
     <l n="165">And that inevitable time drew near ;</l>
     <l n="166">Then through the courts , grown cruel , strange , and drear ,</l>
     <l n="167">Since the bright morn , they led her to the gate .</l>
     <l n="168">Where she beheld a golden litter wait .</l>
     <l n="169">Whereby the King stood , aged and bent to earth ,</l>
     <l n="170">The flute-players with faces void of mirth ,</l>
     <l n="171">The down-cast bearers of the ivory wands ,</l>
     <l n="172">The maiden torch-bearers ’ unhappy bands .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="173">So then was Psyche taken to the hill ,</l>

     <l n="175">For in their houses all the people stayed ,</l>
     <l n="176">Of that most mournful music sore afraid .</l>
     <l n="177">But on the way a marvel did they see ,</l>
     <l n="178">For , passing by , where wrought of ivory ,</l>
     <l n="179">There stood the Goddess of the flowery isle ,</l>
     <l n="180">All folk could see the carven image smile .</l>

     <l n="182">Where Psyche must be left to meet her shame ,</l>
     <l n="183">They set the litter down , and drew aside</l>
     <l n="184">The golden curtains from the wretched bride ,</l>
     <l n="185">Who at their bidding rose and with them went</l>
     <l n="186">Afoot amidst her maids with head down-bent ,</l>
     <l n="187">Until they came unto the drear rock 's brow ;</l>
     <l n="188">And there she stood apart , not weeping now ,</l>
     <l n="189">But pale as privet blossom is in June .</l>
     <l n="190">There as the quivering flutes left off their tune ,</l>
     <l n="191">In trembling arms the weeping , haggard King</l>
     <l n="192">Caught Psyche , who , like some half-lifeless thing ,</l>
     <l n="193">Took all his kisses , and no word could say ,</l>
     <l n="194">Until at last perforce he turned away ;</l>
     <l n="195">Because the longest agony has end ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="197">But Psyche , now faint and bewildered ,</l>

     <l n="408">Within the wooded , deep Laconian vales .</l>
     <l n="409">But right across the vale , from side to side ,</l>
     <l n="410">A high white wall all further view did hide ,</l>
     <l n="411">But that above it , vane and pinnacle</l>
     <l n="412">Rose up , of some great house beyond to tell ,</l>
     <l n="413">And still betwixt these , mountains far away</l>
     <l n="414">Against the sky rose shadowy , cold , and grey .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="415">She , standing in the yellow morning sun ,</l>
     <l n="416">Could scarcely think her happy life was done ,</l>
     <l n="417">Or that the place was made for misery ;</l>
     <l n="418">Yea , some lone heaven it rather seemed to be ,</l>
     <l n="419">Which for the coming band of gods did wait ;</l>
     <l n="420">Hope touched her heart ; no longer desolate ,</l>
     <l n="421">Deserted of all creatures did she feel ,</l>
     <l n="422">And o'er her face sweet colour ‘ gan to steal ,</l>
     <l n="423">That deepened to a flush , as wandering thought</l>
     <l n="424">Desires before unknown unto her brought ,</l>
     <l n="425">So mighty was the God , though far away .</l>
     <l n="426">But trembling midst her hope , she took her way</l>
     <l n="427">Unto a little door midmost the wall ,</l>
     <l n="428">And still on odorous flowers her feet did fall ,</l>
     <l n="429">And round about her did the strange birds sing ,</l>
     <l n="430">Praising her beauty in their carolling .</l>
     <l n="431">Thus coming to the door , when now her hand</l>
     <l n="432">First touched the lock , in doubt she needs must stand ,</l>
     <l n="433">And to herself she said , “ Lo , here the trap !</l>
     <l n="434">And yet , alas ! whatever now may hap ,</l>
     <l n="435">How can I ‘ scape the ill which waiteth me ?</l>
     <l n="436">Let me die now ! ” and herewith , tremblingly ,</l>
     <l n="437">She raised the latch , and her sweet sinless eyes</l>
     <l n="438">Beheld a garden like a paradise ,</l>
     <l n="439">Void of mankind , fairer than words can say ,</l>
     <l n="440">Wherein did joyous harmless creatures play</l>
     <l n="441">After their kind , and all amidst the trees</l>
     <l n="442">Were strange-wrought founts and wondrous images ;</l>
     <l n="443">And glimmering ‘ twixt the boughs could she behold</l>
     <l n="444">A house made beautiful with beaten gold ,</l>
     <l n="445">Whose open doors in the bright sun did gleam ;</l>
     <l n="446">Lonely , but not deserted did it seem .</l>
     <l n="447">Long time she stood debating what to do ,</l>
     <l n="448">But at the last she passed the wicket through ,</l>
     <l n="449">Which , shutting clamorously behind her , sent</l>
     <l n="450">A pang of fear throughout her as she went ;</l>
     <l n="451">But when through all that green place she had passed</l>
     <l n="452">And by the palace porch she stood at last ,</l>
     <l n="453">And saw how wonderfully the wall was wrought ,</l>
     <l n="454">With curious stones from far-off countries brought ,</l>
     <l n="455">And many an image and fair history</l>
     <l n="456">Of what the world has been , and yet shall be ,</l>
     <l n="457">And all set round with golden craftsmanship ,</l>
     <l n="458">Well-wrought as some renowned cup 's royal lip ,</l>
     <l n="459">She had a thought again to turn aside :</l>
     <l n="460">And yet again , not knowing where to bide ,</l>
     <l n="461">She entered softly , and with trembling hands</l>
     <l n="462">Holding her gown ; the wonder of all lands</l>
     <l n="463">Met there the wonders of the land and sea .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="464">Now went she through the chambers tremblingly ,</l>
     <l n="465">And oft in going would she pause and stand ,</l>
     <l n="466">And drop the gathered raiment from her hand ,</l>
     <l n="467">Stilling the beating of her heart for fear</l>
     <l n="468">As voices whispering low she seemed to hear ,</l>
     <l n="469">But then again the wind it seemed to be</l>
     <l n="470">Moving the golden hangings doubtfully ,</l>
     <l n="471">Or some bewildered swallow passing close</l>
     <l n="472">Unto the pane , or some wind-beaten rose .</l>
     <l n="473">Soon seeing that no evil thing came near ,</l>
     <l n="474">A little she began to lose her fear ,</l>
     <l n="475">And gaze upon the wonders of the place ,</l>
     <l n="476">And in the silver mirrors saw her face</l>
     <l n="477">Grown strange to her amidst that loneliness ,</l>
     <l n="478">And stooped to feel the web her feet did press ,</l>
     <l n="479">Wrought by the brown slim-fingered Indian 's toil</l>
     <l n="480">Amidst the years of war and vain turmoil ;</l>
     <l n="481">Or she the figures of the hangings felt ,</l>
     <l n="482">Or daintily the unknown blossoms smelt ,</l>
     <l n="483">Or stood and pondered what new thing might mean</l>
     <l n="484">The images of knight and king and queen</l>
     <l n="485">Wherewith the walls were pictured here and there ,</l>
     <l n="486">Or touched rich vessels with her fingers fair ,</l>
     <l n="487">And o'er her delicate smooth cheek would pass</l>
     <l n="488">The long-fixed bubbles of strange works of glass :</l>
     <l n="489">So wandered she amidst these marvels new</l>
     <l n="490">Until anigh the noontide now it grew .</l>
     <l n="491">At last she came unto a chamber cool</l>
     <l n="492">Paved cunningly in manner of a pool ,</l>
     <l n="493">Where red fish seemed to swim through floating weed</l>
     <l n="494">And at the first she thought it so indeed ,</l>
     <l n="495">And took the sandals quickly from her feet ,</l>
     <l n="496">But when the glassy floor these did but meet</l>
     <l n="497">The shadow of a long-forgotten smile</l>
     <l n="498">Her anxious face a moment did beguile ;</l>
     <l n="499">And crossing o'er , she found a table spread</l>
     <l n="500">With dainty food , as delicate white bread</l>
     <l n="501">And fruits piled up and covered savoury meat ,</l>
     <l n="502">As though a king were coming there to eat ,</l>
     <l n="503">For the worst vessel was of beaten gold .</l>
     <l n="504">Now when these dainties Psyche did behold</l>
     <l n="505">She fain had eaten , but did nowise dare ,</l>
     <l n="506">Thinking she saw a god 's feast lying there .</l>
     <l n="507">But as she turned to go the way she came</l>
     <l n="508">She heard a low soft voice call out her name ,</l>
     <l n="509">Then she stood still , and trembling gazed around ,</l>
     <l n="510">And seeing no man , nigh sank upon the ground ,</l>
     <l n="511">Then through the empty air she heard the voice .</l>

     <l n="529">Now hearing this , did Psyche , trembling sore</l>
     <l n="530">And yet with lighter heart than heretofore ,</l>
     <l n="531">Sit down and eat , till she grew scarce afeard ;</l>
     <l n="532">And nothing but the summer noise she heard</l>
     <l n="533">Within the garden , then , her meal being done ,</l>
     <l n="534">Within the window-seat she watched the sun</l>
     <l n="535">Changing the garden-shadows , till she grew</l>
     <l n="536">Fearless and happy , since she deemed she knew</l>
     <l n="537">The worst that could befall , while still the best</l>
     <l n="538">Shone a fair star far off : and mid the rest</l>
     <l n="539">This brought her after all her grief and fear ,</l>
     <l n="540">She said , “ How sweet it would be , could I hear ,</l>
     <l n="541">Soft music mate the drowsy afternoon ,</l>
     <l n="542">And drown awhile the bees ’ sad murmuring tune</l>
     <l n="543">Within these flowering limes . ” E'en as she spoke ,</l>
     <l n="544">A sweet-voiced choir of unknown unseen folk</l>
     <l n="545">Singing to words that match the sense of these</l>
     <l n="546">Hushed the faint music of the linden trees .</l>

     <l n="36">They ceased , and Psyche pondering o'er their song ,</l>
     <l n="37">Not fearing now that aught would do her wrong ,</l>

     <l n="39">And on the many marvels gazed her fill ,</l>
     <l n="40">Where'er she passed still noting everything ,</l>
     <l n="41">Then in the gardens heard the new birds sing</l>
     <l n="42">And watched the red fish in the fountains play ,</l>
     <l n="43">And at the very faintest time of day</l>
     <l n="44">Upon the grass lay sleeping for a while</l>
     <l n="45">Midst heaven-sent dreams of bliss that made her smile ;</l>
     <l n="46">And when she woke the shades were lengthening ,</l>
     <l n="47">So to the place where she had heard them sing</l>
     <l n="48">She came again , and through a little door</l>
     <l n="49">Entered a chamber with a marble floor ,</l>
     <l n="50">Open a-top unto the outer air ,</l>
     <l n="51">Beneath which lay a bath of water fair ,</l>
     <l n="52">Paved with strange stones and figures of bright gold ,</l>
     <l n="53">And from the steps thereof could she behold</l>
     <l n="54">The slim-leaved trees against the evening sky</l>
     <l n="55">Golden and calm , still moving languidly .</l>
     <l n="56">So for a time upon the brink she sat ,</l>
     <l n="57">Debating in her mind of this and that ,</l>
     <l n="58">And then arose and slowly from her cast</l>
     <l n="59">Her raiment , and adown the steps she passed</l>
     <l n="60">Into the water , and therein she played ,</l>
     <l n="61">Till of herself at last she grew afraid ,</l>
     <l n="62">And of the broken image of her face ,</l>
     <l n="63">And the loud splashing in that lonely place .</l>
     <l n="64">So from the bath she gat her quietly ,</l>
     <l n="65">And clad herself in whatso haste might be ;</l>
     <l n="66">And when at last she was apparelled</l>
     <l n="67">Unto a chamber came , where was a bed</l>
     <l n="68">Of gold and ivory , and precious wood</l>
     <l n="69">Some island bears where never man has stood ;</l>
     <l n="70">And round about hung curtains of delight ,</l>
     <l n="71">Wherein were interwoven Day and Night</l>
     <l n="72">Joined by the hands of Love , and round their wings</l>
     <l n="73">Knots of fair flowers no earthly May-time brings .</l>
     <l n="74">Strange for its beauty was the coverlet ,</l>
     <l n="75">With birds and beasts and flowers wrought over it ;</l>

     <l n="77">Than any man on earth could well devise :</l>

     <l n="87">But looking round , upon a table fair</l>
     <l n="88">She saw a book wherein old tales were writ ,</l>

     <l n="90">Until the dusk had melted into night ,</l>
     <l n="91">When waxen tapers did her servants light</l>

     <l n="156">Framing a gentle speech wherewith to pray</l>
     <l n="157">For leave to see her sisters once again ,</l>
     <l n="158">That they might know her happy , and her pain</l>
     <l n="159">Turned all to joy , and honour come from shame .</l>
     <l n="160">And so at last night and her lover came ,</l>
     <l n="161">And midst their fondling , suddenly she said ,</l>
     <l n="162">“ O Love , a little time we have been wed ,</l>
     <l n="163">And yet I ask a boon of thee this night . ”</l>
     <l n="164">“ Psyche , ” he said , “ if my heart tells me right ,</l>
     <l n="165">This thy desire may bring us bitter woe ,</l>
     <l n="166">For who the shifting chance of fate can know ?</l>
     <l n="167">Yet , forasmuch as mortal hearts are weak ,</l>
     <l n="168">To-morrow shall my folk thy sisters seek ,</l>
     <l n="169">And bear them hither ; but before the day</l>
     <l n="170">Is fully ended must they go away .</l>
     <l n="171">And thou — beware — for , fresh and good and true ,</l>
     <l n="172">Thou knowest not what worldly hearts may do ,</l>
     <l n="173">Or what a curse gold is unto the earth .</l>
     <l n="174">Beware lest from thy full heart , in thy mirth ,</l>
     <l n="175">Thou tell'st the story of thy love unseen :</l>
     <l n="176">Thy loving , simple heart , fits not a queen . ”</l>
     <l n="177">Then by her kisses did she know he frowned ,</l>
     <l n="178">But close about him her fair arms she wound ,</l>
     <l n="179">Until for happiness he ‘ gan to smile ,</l>
     <l n="180">And in those arms forgat all else awhile .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="181">So the next day , for joy that they should come ,</l>
     <l n="182">Would Psyche further deck her strange new home ,</l>
     <l n="183">And even as she ‘ gan to think the thought ,</l>
     <l n="184">Quickly her will by unseen hands was wrought ,</l>
     <l n="185">Who came and went like thoughts . Yea , how should I</l>
     <l n="186">Tell of the works of gold and ivory ,</l>
     <l n="187">The gems and images , those hands brought there</l>
     <l n="188">The prisoned things of earth , and sea , and air ,</l>
     <l n="189">They brought to please their mistress ? Many a beast ,</l>
     <l n="190">Such as King Bacchus in his reckless feast</l>
     <l n="191">Makes merry with — huge elephants , snow-white</l>
     <l n="192">With gilded tusks , or dusky-grey with bright</l>
     <l n="193">And shining chains about their wrinkled necks ;</l>
     <l n="194">The mailed rhinoceros , that of nothing recks ;</l>
     <l n="195">Dusky-maned lions ; spotted leopards fair</l>
     <l n="196">That through the cane-brake move , unseen as air ;</l>
     <l n="197">The deep-mouthed tiger , dread of the brown man ;</l>
     <l n="198">The eagle , and the peacock , and the swan —</l>
     <l n="199">— These be the nobles of the birds and beasts .</l>
     <l n="200">But therewithal , for laughter at their feasts ,</l>
     <l n="201">They brought them the gods ’ jesters , such as be</l>
     <l n="202">Quick-chattering apes , that yet in mockery</l>
     <l n="203">Of anxious men wrinkle their ugly brows ;</l>
     <l n="204">Strange birds with pouches , birds with beaks like prows</l>
     <l n="205">Of merchant-ships , with tufted crests like threads ,</l>
     <l n="206">With unimaginable monstrous heads .</l>
     <l n="207">Lo , such as these , in many a gilded cage</l>
     <l n="208">They brought , or chained for fear of sudden rage .</l>
     <l n="209">Then strewed they scented branches on the floor ,</l>
     <l n="210">And hung rose-garlands up by the great door ,</l>
     <l n="211">And wafted incense through the bowers and halls ,</l>
     <l n="212">And hung up fairer hangings on the walls ,</l>
     <l n="213">And filled the baths with water fresh and clear ,</l>
     <l n="214">And in the chambers laid apparel fair ,</l>
     <l n="215">And spread a table for a royal feast .</l>
     <l n="216">Then when from all these labours they had ceased ,</l>
     <l n="217">Psyche they sung to sleep with lullabies ;</l>
     <l n="218">Who slept not long , but opening soon her eyes ,</l>
     <l n="219">Beheld her sisters on the threshold stand :</l>
     <l n="220">Then did she run to take them by the hand ,</l>
     <l n="221">And laid her cheek to theirs , and murmured words</l>
     <l n="222">Of little meaning , like the moan of birds ,</l>
     <l n="223">While they bewildered stood and gazed around ,</l>
     <l n="224">Like people who in some strange land have found</l>
     <l n="225">One that they thought not of ; but she at last</l>
     <l n="226">Stood back , and from her face the strayed locks cast ,</l>
     <l n="227">And , smiling through her tears , said , “ Ah , that ye</l>
     <l n="228">Should have to weep such useless tears for me !</l>
     <l n="229">Alas , the burden that the city bears</l>
     <l n="230">For nought ! O me , my father 's burning tears ,</l>
     <l n="231">That into all this honour I am come !</l>
     <l n="232">Nay , does he live yet ? Is the ancient home</l>
     <l n="233">Still standing ? do the galleys throng the quays ?</l>
     <l n="234">Do the brown Indians glitter down the ways</l>
     <l n="235">With rubies as of old ? Yes , yes , ye smile ,</l>
     <l n="236">For ye are thinking , but a little while</l>
     <l n="237">Apart from these has she been dwelling here ;</l>
     <l n="238">Truly , yet long enough , loved ones and dear ,</l>
     <l n="239">To make me other than I was of old ,</l>
     <l n="240">Though now when your dear faces I behold</l>
     <l n="241">Am I myself again . But by what road</l>
     <l n="242">Have ye been brought to this my new abode ? ”</l>
     <l n="243">“ Sister , ” said one , “ I rose up from my bed</l>
     <l n="244">It seems this morn , and being apparelléd ,</l>
     <l n="245">And walking in my garden , in a swoon</l>
     <l n="246">Helpless and unattended I sank down ,</l>
     <l n="247">Wherefrom I scarce am waked , for as a dream</l>
     <l n="248">Dost thou with all this royal glory seem ,</l>
     <l n="249">But for thy kisses and thy words , O love . ”</l>
     <l n="250">“ Yea , Psyche , ” said the other , “ as I drove</l>
     <l n="251">The ivory shuttle through the shuttle-race ,</l>
     <l n="252">All was changed suddenly , and in this place</l>
     <l n="253">I found myself , and standing on my feet ,</l>
     <l n="254">Where me with sleepy words this one did greet .</l>
     <l n="255">Now , sister , tell us whence these wonders come</l>
     <l n="256">With all the godlike splendour of your home . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="257">“ Sisters , ” she said , “ more marvels shall ye see</l>

     <l n="259">Whereof I cannot tell you more than this</l>
     <l n="260">That ‘ midst them all I dwell in ease and bliss ,</l>
     <l n="261">Well loved and wedded to a mighty lord ,</l>

     <l n="265">To seek for empty knowledge ; ye shall take</l>
     <l n="266">Some little gifts for your lost sister 's sake ;</l>

     <l n="268">Of nothing frightful have ye any fear . ”</l>
     <l n="269">Wondering they went with her , and looking round ,</l>
     <l n="270">Each in the other 's eyes a strange look found ,</l>
     <l n="271">For these , her mother 's daughters , had no part</l>
     <l n="272">In her divine fresh singleness of heart ,</l>
     <l n="273">But longing to be great , remembered not</l>
     <l n="274">How short a time one heart on earth has got .</l>
     <l n="275">But keener still that guarded look now grew</l>
     <l n="276">As more of that strange lovely place they knew ,</l>
     <l n="277">And as with growing hate , but still afeard ,</l>
     <l n="278">The unseen choirs ’ heart-softening strains they heard ,</l>
     <l n="279">Which did but harden these ; and when at noon</l>
     <l n="280">They sought the shaded waters ’ freshening boon ,</l>
     <l n="281">And all unhidden once again they saw</l>
     <l n="282">That peerless beauty , free from any flaw ,</l>
     <l n="283">Which now at last had won its precious meed ,</l>
     <l n="284">Her kindness then but fed the fire of greed</l>
     <l n="285">Within their hearts — her gifts , the rich attire</l>
     <l n="286">Wherewith she clad them , where like sparks of fire</l>
     <l n="287">The many-coloured gems shone midst the pearls</l>
     <l n="288">The soft silks ’ winding lines , the work of girls</l>
     <l n="289">By the Five Rivers ; their fair marvellous crowns ,</l>
     <l n="290">Their sandals ’ fastenings worth the rent of towns ,</l>
     <l n="291">Zones and carved rings , and nameless wonders fair ,</l>
     <l n="292">All things her faithful slaves had brought them there ,</l>
     <l n="293">Given amid kisses , made them not more glad ;</l>
     <l n="294">Since in their hearts the ravening worm they had</l>
     <l n="295">That love slays not , nor yet is satisfied</l>
     <l n="296">While aught but he has aught ; yet still they tried</l>
     <l n="297">To look as they deemed loving folk should look ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="299">So at the last all being apparelléd ,</l>
     <l n="300">Her sisters to the banquet Psyche led ,</l>
     <l n="301">Fair were they , and each seemed a glorious queen</l>
     <l n="302">With all that wondrous daintiness beseen ,</l>
     <l n="303">But Psyche clad in gown of dusky blue</l>
     <l n="304">Little adorned , with deep grey eyes that knew</l>
     <l n="305">The hidden marvels of Love 's holy fire ,</l>
     <l n="306">Seemed like the soul of innocent desire ,</l>
     <l n="307">Shut from the mocking world , wherefrom those twain</l>
     <l n="308">Seemed come to lure her thence with labour vain .</l>

     <l n="309">Now having reached the place where they should eat ,</l>

     <l n="313">Will he not wish to-day thy kin to see ?</l>
     <l n="314">Then could we tell of thy felicity</l>
     <l n="315">The better , to our folk and father dear . ”</l>
     <l n="316">Then Psyche reddened , “ Nay , he is not here , ”</l>
     <l n="317">She stammered , “ neither will be here to-day ,</l>
     <l n="318">For mighty matters keep him far away . ”</l>
     <l n="319">“ Alas ! ” the younger sister said , “ Say then ,</l>
     <l n="320">What is the likeness of this first of men ;</l>
     <l n="321">What sayest thou about his loving eyne ,</l>
     <l n="322">Are his locks black , or golden-red as thine ? ”</l>
     <l n="323">“ Black-haired like me , ” said Psyche stammering ,</l>
     <l n="324">And looking round , “ what say I ? like the king</l>
     <l n="325">Who rules the world , he seems to me at least —</l>
     <l n="326">Come , sisters , sit , and let us make good feast !</l>
     <l n="327">My darling and my love ye shall behold</l>
     <l n="328">I doubt not soon , his crispy hair of gold ,</l>
     <l n="329">His eyes unseen ; and ye shall hear his voice ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="331">Then did they hold their peace , although indeed</l>
     <l n="332">Her stammering haste they did not fail to heed .</l>
     <l n="333">But at their wondrous royal feast they sat</l>
     <l n="334">Thinking their thoughts , and spoke of this or that</l>
     <l n="335">Between the bursts of music , until when</l>
     <l n="336">The sun was leaving the abodes of men ;</l>
     <l n="337">And then must Psyche to her sisters say</l>
     <l n="338">That she was bid , her husband being away ,</l>
     <l n="339">To suffer none at night to harbour there ,</l>
     <l n="340">No , not the mother that her body bare</l>
     <l n="341">Or father that begat her , therefore they</l>
     <l n="342">Must leave her now , till some still happier day .</l>
     <l n="343">And therewithal more precious gifts she brought</l>
     <l n="344">Whereof not e'en in dreams they could have thought</l>
     <l n="345">Things whereof noble stories might be told ;</l>
     <l n="346">And said ; “ These matters that you here behold</l>

     <l n="348">Farewell , farewell ! and may the high gods save</l>
     <l n="349">Your lives and fame ; and tell our father dear</l>

     <l n="352">When I shall reach a long-enduring home . ”</l>
     <l n="353">Then these , though burning through the night to stay ,</l>
     <l n="354">Spake loving words , and went upon their way ,</l>
     <l n="355">When weeping she had kissed them ; but they wept</l>
     <l n="356">Such tears as traitors do , for as they stepped</l>
     <l n="357">Over the threshold , in each other 's eyes</l>
     <l n="358">They looked , for each was eager to surprise</l>
     <l n="359">The envy that their hearts were filled withal ,</l>

     <l n="363">This singing in the air , and no one seen ,</l>
     <l n="364">These gifts too wonderful for any queen ,</l>
     <l n="365">The trance wherein we both were wrapt away ,</l>

     <l n="393">Long in their homes they brooded over this ,</l>
     <l n="394">And how that Psyche nigh a goddess is ;</l>

     <l n="404">And have no harm for all that here has passed ;</l>
     <l n="405">Or else , my love , bear as thy brave heart may ,</l>
     <l n="406">This loneliness in hope of that fair day ,</l>
     <l n="407">Which , by my head , shall come to thee ; and then</l>

     <l n="425">Asleep beneath some fair tree blossoming ,</l>
     <l n="426">Into her sleep straight cast an evil thing ;</l>

     <l n="488">And after come to suffer double pain . ”</l>
     <l n="489">“ Alas ! what mean you , sister ? ” Psyche said ,</l>
     <l n="490">For terror waxing pale as are the dead .</l>
     <l n="491">“ O sister , speak ! ” “ Child , by this loving kiss , ”</l>

     <l n="503">Sister , in dreadful places have we sought</l>
     <l n="504">To learn about thy case , and thus we found</l>
     <l n="505">A wise man , dwelling underneath the ground</l>
     <l n="506">In a dark awful cave : he told to us</l>
     <l n="507">A horrid tale thereof , and piteous ,</l>
     <l n="508">That thou wert wedded to an evil thing ,</l>
     <l n="509">A serpent-bodied fiend of poisonous sting ,</l>
     <l n="510">Bestial of form , yet therewith lacking not</l>

     <l n="512">Thus ages long agone the gods made him ,</l>
     <l n="513">And set him in a lake hereby to swim ;</l>

     <l n="516">Into a fair young man by night alone .</l>
     <l n="517">Alas , my sister , thou hast cause to groan !</l>
     <l n="518">What sayest thou ?— His words are fair and soft ;</l>
     <l n="519">He raineth loving kisses on me oft ,</l>
     <l n="520">Weeping for love ; he tells me of a day</l>
     <l n="521">When from this place we both shall go away ,</l>
     <l n="522">And he shall kiss me then no more unseen ,</l>
     <l n="523">The while I sit by him a glorious queen ——</l>
     <l n="524">— Alas , poor child ! it pleaseth thee , his kiss ?</l>
     <l n="525">Then must I show thee why he doeth this :</l>
     <l n="526">Because he willeth for a time to save</l>
     <l n="527">Thy body , wretched one ! that he may have</l>
     <l n="528">Both child and mother for his watery hell —</l>
     <l n="529">Ah , what a tale this is for me to tell !</l>
     <l n="530">“ Thou prayest us to save thee , and we can ;</l>
     <l n="531">Since for nought else we sought that wise old man ,</l>
     <l n="532">Who for great gifts and seeing that of kings</l>
     <l n="533">We both were come , has told us all these things ,</l>
     <l n="534">And given us a fair lamp of hallowed oil</l>
     <l n="535">That he has wrought with danger and much toil ;</l>
     <l n="536">And thereto has he added a sharp knife ,</l>
     <l n="537">In forging which he well-nigh lost his life ,</l>
     <l n="538">About him so the devils of the pit</l>
     <l n="539">Came swarming — O , my sister , hast thou it ? ”</l>
     <l n="540">Straight from her gown the other one drew out</l>
     <l n="541">The lamp and knife , which Psyche , dumb with doubt</l>
     <l n="542">And misery at once , took in her hand .</l>
     <l n="543">Then said her sister , “ From this doubtful land</l>
     <l n="544">Thou gav'st us royal gifts a while ago ,</l>
     <l n="545">But these we give thee , though they lack for show ,</l>
     <l n="546">Shall be to thee a better gift ,— thy life .</l>
     <l n="547">Put now in some sure place this lamp and knife ,</l>
     <l n="548">And when he sleeps rise silently from bed</l>
     <l n="549">And hold the hallowed lamp above his head ,</l>
     <l n="550">And swiftly draw the charméd knife across</l>
     <l n="551">His cursed neck , thou well may'st bear the loss ,</l>
     <l n="552">Nor shall he keep his man 's shape more , when he</l>
     <l n="553">First feels the iron wrought so mysticly :</l>
     <l n="554">But thou , flee unto us , we have a tale ,</l>
     <l n="555">Of what has been thy lot within this vale ,</l>
     <l n="556">When we have ‘ scaped therefrom , which we shall do</l>
     <l n="557">By virtue of strange spells the old man knew .</l>
     <l n="558">Farewell , sweet sister ! here we may not stay ,</l>
     <l n="559">Lest in returning he should pass this way ;</l>
     <l n="560">But in the vale we will not fail to wait</l>
     <l n="561">Till thou art loosened from thine evil fate . ”</l>
     <l n="562">Thus went they , and for long they said not aught ,</l>
     <l n="563">Fearful lest any should surprise their thought ,</l>
     <l n="564">But in such wise had envy conquered fear ,</l>
     <l n="565">That they were fain that eve to bide anear</l>
     <l n="566">Their sister 's ruined home ; but when they came</l>
     <l n="567">Unto the river , on them fell the same</l>
     <l n="568">Resistless languor they had felt before .</l>
     <l n="569">And from the blossoms of that flowery shore</l>
     <l n="570">Their sleeping bodies soon did Zephyr bear ,</l>
     <l n="571">For other folk to hatch new ills and care .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="572">But on the ground sat Psyche all alone ,</l>
     <l n="573">The lamp and knife beside her , and no moan</l>
     <l n="574">She made , but silent let the long hours go ,</l>
     <l n="575">Till dark night closed around her and her woe .</l>
     <l n="576">Then trembling she arose , for now drew near</l>
     <l n="577">The time of utter loneliness and fear ,</l>
     <l n="578">And she must think of death , who until now</l>
     <l n="579">Had thought of ruined life , and love brought low ;</l>
     <l n="580">And with , that thought , tormenting doubt there came ,</l>
     <l n="581">And images of some unheard-of shame ,</l>
     <l n="582">Until forlorn , entrapped of gods she felt ,</l>
     <l n="583">As though in some strange hell her spirit dwelt .</l>
     <l n="584">Yet driven by her sisters ’ words at last ,</l>
     <l n="585">And by remembrance of the time now past ,</l>
     <l n="586">When she stood trembling , as the oracle</l>
     <l n="587">With all its fearful doom upon her fell ,</l>
     <l n="588">She to her hapless wedding-chamber turned ,</l>
     <l n="589">And while the waxen tapers freshly burned</l>
     <l n="590">She laid those dread gifts ready to her hand ,</l>
     <l n="591">Then quenched the lights , and by the bed did stand ,</l>
     <l n="592">Turning these matters in her troubled mind ;</l>
     <l n="593">And sometimes hoped some glorious man to find</l>
     <l n="594">Beneath the lamp , fit bridegroom for a bride</l>
     <l n="595">Like her ; ah , then ! with what joy to his side</l>
     <l n="596">Would she creep back in the dark silent night ;</l>
     <l n="597">But whiles she quaked at thought of what a sight</l>
     <l n="598">The lamp might show her ; the hot rush of blood</l>
     <l n="599">The knife might shed upon her as she stood ,</l>
     <l n="600">The dread of some pursuit , the hurrying out ,</l>
     <l n="601">Through rooms where every sound would seem a shout</l>
     <l n="602">Into the windy night among the trees ,</l>
     <l n="603">Where many a changing monstrous sight one sees ,</l>
     <l n="604">When nought at all has happed to chill the blood .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="605">But as among these evil thoughts she stood ,</l>
     <l n="606">She heard him coming , and straight crept to bed .</l>
     <l n="607">And felt him touch her with a new-born dread ,</l>
     <l n="608">And durst not answer to his words of love .</l>
     <l n="609">But when he slept , she rose that tale to prove .</l>
     <l n="610">And sliding down as softly as might be ,</l>
     <l n="611">And moving through the chamber quietly ,</l>
     <l n="612">She gat the lamp within her trembling hand ,</l>
     <l n="613">And long , debating of these things , did stand</l>
     <l n="614">In that thick darkness , till she seemed to be</l>
     <l n="615">A dweller in some black eternity ,</l>
     <l n="616">And what she once had called the world did seem</l>
     <l n="617">A hollow void , a colourless mad dream ;</l>
     <l n="618">For she felt so alone — three times in vain</l>
     <l n="619">She moved her heavy hand , three times again</l>
     <l n="620">It fell adown ; at last throughout the place</l>
     <l n="621">Its flame glared , lighting up her woeful face ,</l>
     <l n="622">Whose eyes the silken carpet did but meet ,</l>
     <l n="623">Grown strange and awful , and her own wan feet</l>
     <l n="624">As toward the bed she stole ; but come thereto</l>
     <l n="625">Back with dosed eyes and quivering lips , she threw</l>
     <l n="626">Her lovely head , and strove to think of it ,</l>
     <l n="627">While images of fearful things did flit</l>
     <l n="628">Before her eyes ; thus , raising up the hand</l>
     <l n="629">That bore the lamp , one moment did she stand</l>
     <l n="630">As man 's time tells it , and then suddenly</l>
     <l n="631">Opened her eyes , but scarce kept back a cry</l>
     <l n="632">At what she saw ; for there before her lay</l>
     <l n="633">The very Love brighter than dawn of day ;</l>
     <l n="634">And as he lay there smiling , her own name</l>
     <l n="635">His gentle lips in sleep began to frame ,</l>
     <l n="636">And as to touch her face his hand did move ;</l>
     <l n="637">O then , indeed , her faint heart swelled for love ,</l>
     <l n="638">And she began to sob , and tears fell fast</l>
     <l n="639">Upon the bed .— But as she turned at last</l>
     <l n="640">To quench the lamp , there happed a little thing</l>
     <l n="641">That quenched her new delight , for flickering</l>
     <l n="642">The treacherous flame cast on his shoulder fair</l>
     <l n="643">A burning drop ; he woke , and seeing her there</l>
     <l n="644">The meaning of that sad sight knew full well ,</l>
     <l n="645">Nor was there need the piteous tale to tell .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="646">Then on her knees she fell with a great cry ,</l>

     <l n="648">And she began to know what she had done ,</l>
     <l n="649">And saw herself henceforth , unloved , alone ,</l>
     <l n="650">Pass onward to the grave ; and once again</l>
     <l n="651">She heard the voice she now must love in vain</l>
     <l n="652">“ Ah , has it come to pass ? and hast thou lost</l>
     <l n="653">A life of love , and must thou still be tossed</l>
     <l n="654">One moment in the sun ‘ twixt night and night ?</l>
     <l n="655">And must I lose what would have been delight ,</l>
     <l n="656">Untasted yet amidst immortal bliss ,</l>

     <l n="678">Nor quite remember , till these things shall seem</l>
     <l n="679">The wavering memory of a lovely dream . ”</l>
     <l n="680">Therewith he caught his shafts up and his bow ,</l>
     <l n="681">And striding through the chambers did he go ,</l>

     <l n="684">And when into the moonlit night he came</l>
     <l n="685">From out her sight he vanished like a flame ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="688">At daybreak when she lifted up her eyes ,</l>
     <l n="689">She looked around with heavy dull surprise ,</l>
     <l n="690">And rose to enter the fair golden place ;</l>
     <l n="691">But then remembering all her piteous case</l>
     <l n="692">She turned away , lamenting very sore ,</l>
     <l n="693">And wandered down unto the river shore ;</l>
     <l n="694">There , at the head of a green pool and deep ,</l>
     <l n="695">She stood so long that she forgot to weep ,</l>
     <l n="696">And the wild things about the water-side</l>
     <l n="697">From such a silent thing cared not to hide ;</l>
     <l n="698">The dace pushed ‘ gainst the stream , the dragon-fly ,</l>
     <l n="699">With its green-painted wing , went flickering by ;</l>
     <l n="700">The water-hen , the lustred kingfisher ,</l>
     <l n="701">Went on their ways and took no heed of her ;</l>
     <l n="702">The little reed birds never ceased to sing ,</l>
     <l n="703">And still the eddy , like a living thing ,</l>
     <l n="704">Broke into sudden gurgles at her feet .</l>
     <l n="705">But ‘ midst these fair things , on that morning sweet ,</l>
     <l n="706">How could she , weary creature , find a place ?</l>
     <l n="707">She moved at last , and lifting up her face ,</l>
     <l n="708">Gathered her raiment up and cried , “ Farewell ,</l>
     <l n="709">O fairest lord ! and since I cannot dwell</l>
     <l n="710">With thee in heaven , let me now hide my head</l>
     <l n="711">In whatsoever dark place dwell the dead ! ”</l>
     <l n="712">And with that word she leapt into the stream ,</l>
     <l n="713">But the kind river even yet did deem</l>
     <l n="714">That she should live , and , with all gentle care ,</l>
     <l n="715">Cast her ashore within a meadow fair .</l>
     <l n="716">Upon the other side , where Shepherd Pan</l>
     <l n="717">Sat looking down upon the water wan ,</l>
     <l n="718">Goat-legged and merry , who called out , “ Fair maid</l>
     <l n="719">Why goest thou hurrying to the feeble shade</l>
     <l n="720">Whence none return ? Well do I know thy pain ,</l>
     <l n="721">For I am old , and have not lived in vain ;</l>
     <l n="722">Thou wilt forget all that within a while ,</l>
     <l n="723">And on some other happy youth wilt smile ;</l>
     <l n="724">And sure he must be dull indeed if he</l>
     <l n="725">Forget not all things in his ecstasy</l>
     <l n="726">At sight of such a wonder made for him ,</l>
     <l n="727">That in that clinging gown makes mine eyes swim ,</l>
     <l n="728">Old as I am : but to the god of Love</l>
     <l n="729">Pray now , sweet child , for all things can he move . ”</l>
     <l n="730">Weeping she passed him , but full reverently ,</l>
     <l n="731">And well she saw that she was not to die</l>
     <l n="732">Till she had filled the measure of her woe .</l>
     <l n="733">So through the meads she passed , half blind and slow ,</l>

     <l n="758">Thenceforth her back upon the world she turned</l>
     <l n="759">As she had known it ; in her heart there burned</l>
     <l n="760">Such deathless love , that still untired she went :</l>
     <l n="761">The huntsman dropping down the woody bent ,</l>
     <l n="762">In the still evening , saw her passing by ,</l>

     <l n="766">As on the hill 's brow , looking o'er the lands ,</l>
     <l n="767">She stood with straining eyes and clinging hands ,</l>
     <l n="768">While the wind blew the raiment from her feet ;</l>
     <l n="769">The wandering soldier her grey eyes would meet ,</l>

     <l n="771">Like a thin dream she passed the clattering town ;</l>
     <l n="772">On the thronged quays she watched the ships come in</l>
     <l n="773">Patient , amid the strange outlandish din ;</l>
     <l n="774">Unscared she saw the sacked towns ’ miseries ,</l>
     <l n="775">And marching armies passed before her eyes .</l>
     <l n="776">And still of her the god had such a care</l>
     <l n="777">That none might wrong her , though alone and fair .</l>
     <l n="778">Through rough and smooth she wandered many a day ,</l>

     <l n="790">Amidst these things , the eldest sister lay</l>
     <l n="791">Asleep one evening of a summer day ,</l>
     <l n="792">Dreaming she saw the god of Love anigh ,</l>
     <l n="793">Who seemed to say unto her lovingly ,</l>
     <l n="794">“ Hail unto thee , fair sister of my love ;</l>
     <l n="795">Nor fear me for that thou her faith didst prove ,</l>
     <l n="796">And found it wanting , for thou , too , art fair ,</l>
     <l n="797">Nor is her place filled ; rise , and have no care</l>
     <l n="798">For father or for friends , but go straightway</l>
     <l n="799">Unto the rock where she was borne that day ;</l>
     <l n="800">There , if thou hast a will to be my bride ,</l>
     <l n="801">Put thou all fear of horrid death aside ,</l>
     <l n="802">And leap from off the cliff , and there will come</l>
     <l n="803">My slaves , to bear thee up and take thee home .</l>
     <l n="804">Haste then , before the summer night grows late ,</l>
     <l n="805">For in my house thy beauty I await ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="806">So spake the dream ; and through the night did sail ,</l>
     <l n="807">And to the other sister bore the tale ,</l>
     <l n="808">While this one rose , nor doubted of the thing ,</l>
     <l n="809">Such deadly pride unto her heart did cling ;</l>
     <l n="810">But by the tapers ’ light triumphantly ,</l>
     <l n="811">Smiling , her mirrored body did she eye ,</l>
     <l n="812">Then hastily rich raiment on her cast</l>
     <l n="813">And through the sleeping serving-people passed ,</l>
     <l n="814">And looked with changed eyes on the moonlit street ,</l>
     <l n="815">Nor scarce could feel the ground beneath her feet .</l>
     <l n="816">But long the time seemed to her , till she came</l>
     <l n="817">There where her sister once was borne to shame ;</l>
     <l n="818">And when she reached the bare cliff 's rugged brow</l>
     <l n="819">She cried aloud , “ O Love , receive me now ,</l>
     <l n="820">Who am not all unworthy to be thine ! ”</l>
     <l n="821">And with that word , her jewelled arms did shine</l>
     <l n="822">Outstretched beneath the moon , and with one breath</l>
     <l n="823">She sprung to meet the outstretched arms of Death ,</l>
     <l n="824">The only god that waited for her there ,</l>
     <l n="825">And in a gathered moment of despair</l>
     <l n="826">A hideous thing her traitrous life did seem .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="827">But with the passing of that hollow dream</l>
     <l n="828">The other sister rose , and as she might ,</l>
     <l n="829">Arrayed herself alone in that still night ,</l>
     <l n="830">And so stole forth , and making no delay</l>
     <l n="831">Came to the rock anigh the dawn of day ;</l>
     <l n="832">No warning there her sister 's spirit gave ,</l>
     <l n="833">No doubt came nigh the fore-doomed soul to save ,</l>
     <l n="834">But with a fever burning in her blood ,</l>
     <l n="835">With glittering eyes and crimson cheeks she stood</l>
     <l n="836">One moment on the brow , the while she cried ,</l>
     <l n="837">“ Receive me , Love , chosen to be thy bride</l>
     <l n="838">From all the million women of the world ! ”</l>
     <l n="839">Then o'er the cliff her wicked limbs were hurled ,</l>
     <l n="840">Nor has the language of the earth a name</l>
     <l n="841">For that surprise of terror and of shame .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="842">Now , midst her wanderings , on a hot noontide ,</l>
     <l n="843">Psyche passed down a road , where , on each side</l>
     <l n="844">The yellow cornfields lay , although as yet</l>
     <l n="845">Unto the stalks no sickle had been set ;</l>
     <l n="846">The lark sung over them , the butterfly</l>
     <l n="847">Flickered from ear to ear distractedly ,</l>
     <l n="848">The kestrel hung above , the weasel peered</l>
     <l n="849">From out the wheat-stalks on her unafeard ,</l>
     <l n="850">Along the road the trembling poppies shed</l>
     <l n="851">On the burnt grass their crumpled leaves and red ;</l>
     <l n="852">Most lonely was it , nothing Psyche knew</l>
     <l n="853">Unto what land of all the world she drew ;</l>
     <l n="854">Aweary was she , faint and sick at heart ,</l>
     <l n="855">Bowed to the earth by thoughts of that sad part</l>
     <l n="856">She needs must play : some blue flower from the corn</l>
     <l n="857">That in her fingers erewhile she had borne ,</l>
     <l n="858">Now dropped from them , still clung unto her gown ;</l>
     <l n="859">Over the hard way hung her head adown</l>
     <l n="860">Despairingly , but still her weary feet</l>
     <l n="861">Moved on half conscious , her lost love to meet .</l>
     <l n="862">So going , at the last she raised her eyes ,</l>
     <l n="863">And saw a grassy mound before her rise</l>
     <l n="864">Over the yellow plain , and thereon was</l>
     <l n="865">A marble fane with doors of burnished brass ,</l>
     <l n="866">That ‘ twixt the pillars set about it burned ;</l>
     <l n="867">So thitherward from off the road she turned ,</l>
     <l n="868">And soon she heard a rippling water sound ,</l>
     <l n="869">And reached a stream that girt the hill around ,</l>
     <l n="870">Whose green waves wooed her body lovingly ;</l>
     <l n="871">So looking round , and seeing no soul anigh ,</l>
     <l n="872">Unclad , she crossed the shallows , and there laid</l>
     <l n="873">Her dusty raiment in the alder-shade ,</l>
     <l n="874">And slipped adown into the shaded pool ,</l>
     <l n="875">And with the pleasure of the water cool</l>
     <l n="876">Soothed her tired limbs awhile , then with a sigh</l>
     <l n="877">Came forth , and clad her body hastily ,</l>
     <l n="878">And up the hill made for the little fane .</l>
     <l n="879">But when its threshold now her feet did gain ,</l>
     <l n="880">She , looking through the pillars of the shrine ,</l>
     <l n="881">Beheld therein a golden image shine</l>
     <l n="882">Of golden Ceres ; then she passed the door ,</l>
     <l n="883">And with bowed head she stood awhile before</l>
     <l n="884">The smiling image , striving for some word</l>
     <l n="885">That did not name her lover and her lord ,</l>
     <l n="886">Until midst rising tears at last she prayed :</l>
     <l n="887">“ O kind one , if while yet I was a maid</l>
     <l n="888">I ever did thee pleasure , on this day</l>
     <l n="889">Be kind to me , poor wanderer on the way ,</l>
     <l n="890">Who strive my love upon the earth to meet !</l>
     <l n="891">Then let me rest my weary , doubtful feet</l>
     <l n="892">Within thy quiet house a little while ,</l>
     <l n="893">And on my rest if thou wouldst please to smile ,</l>
     <l n="894">And send me news of my own love and lord ,</l>
     <l n="895">It would not cost thee , lady , many a word . ”</l>
     <l n="896">But straight from out the shrine a sweet voice came ,</l>
     <l n="897">“ O Psyche , though of me thou hast no blame ,</l>
     <l n="898">And though indeed thou sparedst not to give</l>
     <l n="899">What my soul loved , while happy thou didst live ,</l>
     <l n="900">Yet little can I give now unto thee ,</l>
     <l n="901">Since thou art rebel , slave , and enemy</l>
     <l n="902">Unto the love-inspiring Queen ; this grace</l>
     <l n="903">Thou hast alone of me , to leave this place</l>
     <l n="904">Free as thou camest , though the lovely one</l>
     <l n="905">Seeks for the sorceress who entrapped her son</l>
     <l n="906">In every land , and has small joy in aught ,</l>
     <l n="907">Until before her presence thou art brought . ”</l>
     <l n="908">Then Psyche , trembling at the words she spake ,</l>
     <l n="909">Durst answer nought , nor for that counsel 's sake</l>
     <l n="910">Could other offerings leave except her tears ,</l>
     <l n="911">As now , tormented by the new-born fears</l>
     <l n="912">The words divine had raised in her , she passed</l>
     <l n="913">The brazen threshold once again , and cast</l>
     <l n="914">A dreary hopeless look across the plain ,</l>
     <l n="915">Whose golden beauty now seemed nought and vain</l>
     <l n="916">Unto her aching heart ; then down the hill</l>
     <l n="917">She went , and crossed the shallows of the rill ,</l>
     <l n="918">And wearily she went upon her way ,</l>
     <l n="919">Nor any homestead passed upon that day ,</l>
     <l n="920">Nor any hamlet , and at night lay down</l>
     <l n="921">Within a wood , far off from any town .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="922">There , waking at the dawn , did she behold ,</l>
     <l n="923">Through the green leaves , a glimmer as of gold ,</l>
     <l n="924">And , passing on , amidst an oak-grove found</l>
     <l n="925">A pillared temple gold-adorned and round ,</l>
     <l n="926">Whose walls were hung with rich and precious things ,</l>
     <l n="927">Worthy to be the ransom of great kings ;</l>
     <l n="928">And in the midst of gold and ivory</l>
     <l n="929">An image of Queen Juno did she see ;</l>
     <l n="930">Then her heart swelled within her , and she thought ,</l>
     <l n="931">“ Surely the gods hereto my steps have brought ,</l>
     <l n="932">And they will yet be merciful and give</l>
     <l n="933">Some little joy to me , that I may live</l>
     <l n="934">Till my Love finds me . ” Then upon her knees</l>
     <l n="935">She fell , and prayed , “ O Crown of goddesses ,</l>
     <l n="936">I pray thee , give me shelter in this place ,</l>
     <l n="937">Nor turn away from me thy much-loved face ,</l>
     <l n="938">If ever I gave golden gifts to thee</l>
     <l n="939">In happier times when my right hand was free . ”</l>
     <l n="940">Then from the inmost shrine there came a voice</l>
     <l n="941">That said , “ It is so , well mayst thou rejoice</l>
     <l n="942">That of thy gifts I yet have memory ,</l>
     <l n="943">Wherefore mayst thou depart forewarned and free ;</l>
     <l n="944">Since she that won the golden apple lives ,</l>
     <l n="945">And to her servants mighty gifts now gives</l>
     <l n="946">To find thee out , in whatso land thou art ,</l>
     <l n="947">For thine undoing ; loiter not , depart !</l>
     <l n="948">For what immortal yet shall shelter thee</l>
     <l n="949">From her that rose from out the unquiet sea ? ”</l>
     <l n="950">Then Psyche moaned out in her grief and fear ,</l>
     <l n="951">“ Alas ! and is there shelter anywhere</l>
     <l n="952">Upon the green flame-hiding earth ? ” said she ,</l>
     <l n="953">“ Or yet beneath it is there peace for me ?</l>
     <l n="954">O Love , since in thine arms I cannot rest ,</l>
     <l n="955">Or lay my weary head upon thy breast ,</l>
     <l n="956">Have pity yet upon thy love forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="957">Make me as though I never had been born ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="958">Then wearily she went upon her way ,</l>
     <l n="959">And so , about the middle of the day ,</l>
     <l n="960">She came before a green and flowery place ,</l>
     <l n="961">Walled round about in manner of a chase ,</l>
     <l n="962">Whereof the gates as now were open wide ;</l>
     <l n="963">Fair grassy glades and long she saw inside</l>
     <l n="964">Betwixt great trees , down which the unscared deer</l>
     <l n="965">Were playing ; yet a pang of deadly fear ,</l>
     <l n="966">She knew not why , shot coldly through her heart ,</l>
     <l n="967">And thrice she turned as though she would depart ,</l>
     <l n="968">And thrice returned , and in the gateway stood</l>
     <l n="969">With wavering feet : small flowers as red as blood</l>
     <l n="970">Were growing up amid the soft green grass ,</l>
     <l n="971">And here and there a fallen rose there was ,</l>
     <l n="972">And on the trodden grass a silken lace ,</l>
     <l n="973">As though crowned revellers had passed by the place</l>
     <l n="974">The restless sparrows chirped upon the wall</l>
     <l n="975">And faint far music on her ears did fall ,</l>
     <l n="976">And from the trees within , the pink-foot doves</l>
     <l n="977">Still told their weary tale unto their loves ,</l>
     <l n="978">And all seemed peaceful more than words could say .</l>
     <l n="979">Then she , whose heart still whispered , “ Keep away . ”</l>
     <l n="980">Was drawn by strong desire unto the place ,</l>
     <l n="981">So toward the greenest glade she set her face ,</l>
     <l n="982">Murmuring , “ Alas ! and what a wretch am I ,</l>
     <l n="983">That I should fear the summer 's greenery !</l>
     <l n="984">Yea , and is death now any more an ill ,</l>
     <l n="985">When lonely through the world I wander still . ”</l>
     <l n="986">But when she was amidst those ancient groves ,</l>
     <l n="987">Whose close green leaves and choirs of moaning doves</l>
     <l n="988">Shut out the world , then so alone she seemed ,</l>
     <l n="989">So strange , her former life was but as dreamed ;</l>
     <l n="990">Beside the hopes and fears that drew her on ,</l>
     <l n="991">Till so far through that green place she had won ,</l>
     <l n="992">That she a rose-hedged garden could behold</l>
     <l n="993">Before a house made beautiful with gold ;</l>
     <l n="994">Which , to her mind beset with that past dream ,</l>
     <l n="995">And dim foreshadowings of ill fate , did seem</l>
     <l n="996">That very house , her joy and misery ,</l>
     <l n="997">Where that fair sight her longing eyes did see</l>
     <l n="998">They should not see again ; but now the sound</l>
     <l n="999">Of pensive music echoing all around ,</l>
     <l n="1000">Made all things like a picture , and from thence</l>
     <l n="1001">Bewildering odours floating , dulled her sense ,</l>
     <l n="1002">And killed her fear , and , urged by strong desire</l>
     <l n="1003">To see how all should end , she drew yet nigher ,</l>
     <l n="1004">And o'er the hedge beheld the heads of girls</l>
     <l n="1005">Embraced by garlands fresh and orient pearls ,</l>
     <l n="1006">And heard sweet voices murmuring ; then a thrill</l>
     <l n="1007">Of utmost joy all memory seemed to kill</l>
     <l n="1008">Of good or evil , and her eager hand</l>
     <l n="1009">Was on the wicket , then her feet did stand</l>
     <l n="1010">Upon new flowers , the while her dizzied eyes</l>
     <l n="1011">Gazed wildly round on half-seen mysteries ,</l>
     <l n="1012">And wandered from unnoting face to face .</l>
     <l n="1013">For round a fountain midst the flowery place</l>
     <l n="1014">Did she behold full many a minstrel girl ;</l>
     <l n="1015">While nigh them , on the grass in giddy whirl ,</l>
     <l n="1016">Bright raiment and white limbs and sandalled feet</l>
     <l n="1017">Flew round in time unto the music sweet ,</l>
     <l n="1018">Whose strains no more were pensive now nor sad ,</l>
     <l n="1019">But rather a fresh sound of triumph had ;</l>
     <l n="1020">And round the dance were gathered damsels fair ,</l>
     <l n="1021">Clad in rich robes adorned with jewels rare ;</l>
     <l n="1022">Or little hidden by some woven mist ,</l>
     <l n="1023">That , hanging round them , here a bosom kissed</l>
     <l n="1024">And there a knee , or driven by the wind</l>
     <l n="1025">About some lily 's bowing stem was twined .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="1026">But when a little Psyche 's eyes grew clear ,</l>
     <l n="1027">A sight they saw that brought back all her fear</l>
     <l n="1028">A hundred-fold , though neither heaven nor earth</l>
     <l n="1029">To such a fair sight elsewhere could give birth ;</l>
     <l n="1030">Because apart , upon a golden throne</l>
     <l n="1031">Of marvellous work , a woman sat alone ,</l>
     <l n="1032">Watching the dancers with a smiling face ,</l>
     <l n="1033">Whose beauty sole had lighted up the place .</l>

     <l n="1172">And when she stood before her trembling , said ,</l>

     <l n="1183">And from their hempen mouths a stream did pour</l>

     <l n="1185">Poppies and millet , and coriander sweet ,</l>

     <l n="1200">Somewhat she dropped , and low adown she flew</l>
     <l n="1201">Until she reached the temple that she knew</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="38">
     <l n="1203">But Psyche sadly labouring all the while</l>
     <l n="1204">With hopeless heart felt the swift hours go by ,</l>
     <l n="1205">And knowing well what bitter mockery</l>
     <l n="1206">Lay in that task , yet did she what she might</l>
     <l n="1207">That something should be finished ere the night ,</l>
     <l n="1208">And she a little mercy yet might ask ;</l>
     <l n="1209">But the first hours of that long feverish task</l>
     <l n="1210">Passed amid mocks ; for oft the damsels came</l>
     <l n="1211">About her , and made merry with her shame ,</l>
     <l n="1212">And laughed to see her trembling eagerness ,</l>
     <l n="1213">And how , with some small lappet of her dress ,</l>
     <l n="1214">She winnowed out the wheat , and how she bent</l>
     <l n="1215">Over the millet , hopelessly intent ;</l>
     <l n="1216">And how she guarded well some tiny heap</l>
     <l n="1217">But just begun , from their long raiments ’ sweep ;</l>
     <l n="1218">And how herself , with girt gown , carefully</l>
     <l n="1219">She went betwixt the heaps that ‘ gan to lie</l>
     <l n="1220">Along the floor ; though they were small enow ,</l>
     <l n="1221">When shadows lengthened and the sun was low ;</l>
     <l n="1222">But at the last these left her labouring ,</l>
     <l n="1223">Not daring now to weep , lest some small thing</l>
     <l n="1224">Should ‘ scape her blinded eyes , and soon far off</l>
     <l n="1225">She heard the echoes of their careless scoff .</l>
     <l n="1226">Longer the shades grew , quicker sank the sun ,</l>
     <l n="1227">Until at last the day was well-nigh done ,</l>
     <l n="1228">And every minute did she think to hear</l>
     <l n="1229">The fair Queen 's dreaded footsteps drawing near ;</l>
     <l n="1230">But Love , that moves the earth , and skies , and sea ,</l>
     <l n="1231">Beheld his old love in her misery ,</l>
     <l n="1232">And wrapped her heart in sudden gentle sleep ;</l>
     <l n="1233">And meanwhile caused unnumbered ants to creep</l>
     <l n="1234">About her , and they wrought so busily</l>
     <l n="1235">That all , ere sundown , was as it should be ,</l>
     <l n="1236">And homeward went again the kingless folk .</l>
     <l n="1237">Bewildered with her joy again she woke ,</l>
     <l n="1238">But scarce had time the unseen hands to bless ,</l>
     <l n="1239">That thus had helped her utter feebleness ,</l>
     <l n="1240">Ere Venus came , fresh from the watery way ,</l>
     <l n="1241">Panting with all the pleasure of the day ;</l>
     <l n="1242">But when she saw the ordered heaps , her smile</l>
     <l n="1243">Faded away , she cried out , “ Base and vile</l>
     <l n="1244">Thou art indeed , this labour fitteth thee ;</l>
     <l n="1245">But now I know thy feigned simplicity ,</l>
     <l n="1246">Thine inward cunning , therefore hope no more ,</l>
     <l n="1247">Since thou art furnished well with hidden lore ,</l>
     <l n="1248">To ‘ scape thy due reward , if any day</l>
     <l n="1249">Without some task accomplished , pass away ! ”</l>
     <l n="1250">So with a frown she passed on , muttering ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="39">
     <l n="1252">So the next morning Psyche did they lead</l>
     <l n="1253">Unto a terrace o'er a flowery mead ,</l>
     <l n="1254">Where Venus sat , hid from the young sun 's rays ,</l>
     <l n="1255">Upon the fairest of all summer days ;</l>
     <l n="1256">She pointed o'er the meads as they drew nigh ,</l>
     <l n="1257">And said , “ See how that stream goes glittering by ,</l>
     <l n="1258">And on its banks my golden sheep now pass ,</l>
     <l n="1259">Cropping sweet mouthfuls of the flowery grass ;</l>
     <l n="1260">If thou , O cunning slave , to-day art fain</l>
     <l n="1261">To save thyself from well-remembered pain ,</l>
     <l n="1262">Put forth a little of thy hidden skill ,</l>
     <l n="1263">And with their golden fleece thy bosom fill ;</l>
     <l n="1264">Yet make no haste , but ere the sun is down</l>
     <l n="1265">Cast it before my feet from out thy gown ;</l>
     <l n="1266">Surely thy labour is but light to-day . ”</l>
     <l n="1267">Then sadly went poor Psyche on her way ,</l>
     <l n="1268">Wondering wherein the snare lay , for she knew</l>
     <l n="1269">No easy thing it was she had to do ;</l>
     <l n="1270">Nor had she failed indeed to note the smile</l>
     <l n="1271">Wherewith the goddess praised her for the guile</l>
     <l n="1272">That she , unhappy , lacked so utterly .</l>
     <l n="1273">Amidst these thoughts she crossed the flowery lea ,</l>
     <l n="1274">And came unto the glittering river 's side ;</l>
     <l n="1275">And , seeing it was neither deep nor wide ,</l>
     <l n="1276">She drew her sandals off , and to the knee</l>
     <l n="1277">Girt up her gown , and by a willow-tree</l>
     <l n="1278">Went down into the water , and but sank</l>
     <l n="1279">Up to mid-leg therein ; but from the bank</l>
     <l n="1280">She scarce had gone three steps , before a voice</l>
     <l n="1281">Called out to her , “ Stay , Psyche , and rejoice</l>
     <l n="1282">That I am here to help thee , a poor reed ,</l>
     <l n="1283">The soother of the loving hearts that bleed ,</l>
     <l n="1284">The pourer forth of notes , that oft have made</l>
     <l n="1285">The weak man strong , and the rash man afraid .</l>
     <l n="1286">“ Sweet child , when by me now thy dear foot trod ,</l>
     <l n="1287">I knew thee for the loved one of our god ;</l>
     <l n="1288">Then prithee take my counsel in good part ;</l>
     <l n="1289">Go to the shore again , and rest thine heart</l>
     <l n="1290">In sleep awhile , until the sun get low ,</l>
     <l n="1291">And then across the river shalt thou go</l>
     <l n="1292">And find these evil creatures sleeping fast ,</l>
     <l n="1293">And on the bushes whereby they have passed</l>
     <l n="1294">Much golden wool ; take what seems good to thee ,</l>
     <l n="1295">And ere the sun sets go back easily .</l>
     <l n="1296">But if within that mead thou sett'st thy feet</l>
     <l n="1297">While yet they wake , an ill death shalt thou meet ,</l>
     <l n="1298">For they are of a cursed man-hating race ,</l>
     <l n="1299">Bred by a giant in a lightless place . ”</l>
     <l n="1300">But at these words soft tears filled Psyche 's eyes</l>
     <l n="1301">As hope of love within her heart did rise ;</l>
     <l n="1302">And when she saw she was not helpless yet</l>
     <l n="1303">Her old desire she would not quite forget ;</l>
     <l n="1304">But turning back , upon the bank she lay</l>
     <l n="1305">In happy dreams till nigh the end of day ;</l>
     <l n="1306">Then did she cross and gather of the wool ,</l>
     <l n="1307">And with her bosom and her gown-skirt full</l>
     <l n="1308">Came back to Venus at the sun-setting ;</l>
     <l n="1309">But she afar off saw it glistering</l>
     <l n="1310">And cried aloud , “ Go , take the slave away ,</l>
     <l n="1311">And keep her safe for yet another day ,</l>
     <l n="1312">And on the morning will I think again</l>
     <l n="1313">Of some fresh task , since with so little pain</l>
     <l n="1314">She doeth what the gods find hard enow ;</l>
     <l n="1315">For since the winds were pleased this waif to blow</l>
     <l n="1316">Unto my door , a fool I were indeed ,</l>
     <l n="1317">If I should fail to use her for my need . ”</l>
     <l n="1318">So her they led away from that bright sun ,</l>
     <l n="1319">Now scarce more hopeful that the task was done ,</l>
     <l n="1320">Since by those bitter words she knew full well</l>
     <l n="1321">Another tale the coming day would tell .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="40">
     <l n="1322">But the next morn upon a turret high ,</l>
     <l n="1323">Where the wind kissed her raiment lovingly ,</l>
     <l n="1324">Stood Venus waiting her ; and when she came</l>
     <l n="1325">She said , “ O slave , thy city 's very shame ,</l>
     <l n="1326">Lift up thy cunning eyes , and looking hence</l>
     <l n="1327">Shalt thou behold betwixt these battlements ,</l>
     <l n="1328">A black and barren mountain set aloof</l>
     <l n="1329">From the green hills , shaped like a palace roof .</l>
     <l n="1330">Ten leagues from hence it lieth , toward the north ,</l>
     <l n="1331">And from its rocks a fountain welleth forth ,</l>
     <l n="1332">Black like itself , and floweth down its side ,</l>
     <l n="1333">And in a while part into Styx doth glide ,</l>
     <l n="1334">And part into Cocytus runs away ,</l>
     <l n="1335">Now coming thither by the end of day ,</l>
     <l n="1336">Fill me this ewer from out the awful stream ;</l>
     <l n="1337">Such task a sorceress like thee will deem</l>
     <l n="1338">A little matter ; bring it not to pass ,</l>
     <l n="1339">And if thou be not made of steel or brass ,</l>
     <l n="1340">To-morrow shalt thou find the bitterest day</l>
     <l n="1341">Thou yet hast known , and all be sport and play</l>
     <l n="1342">To what thy heart in that hour shall endure —</l>
     <l n="1343">Behold , I swear it , and my word is sure ! ”</l>
     <l n="1344">She turned therewith to go down toward the sea ,</l>
     <l n="1345">To meet her lover , who from Thessaly</l>
     <l n="1346">Was come from some well-foughten field of war .</l>
     <l n="1347">But Psyche , wandering wearily afar ,</l>
     <l n="1348">Reached the bare foot of that black rock at last ,</l>
     <l n="1349">And sat there grieving for the happy past ,</l>
     <l n="1350">For surely now , she thought , no help could be ,</l>
     <l n="1351">She had but reached the final misery ,</l>
     <l n="1352">Nor had she any counsel but to weep .</l>
     <l n="1353">For not alone the place was very steep ,</l>
     <l n="1354">And craggy beyond measure , but she knew</l>
     <l n="1355">What well it was that she was driven to ,</l>
     <l n="1356">The dreadful water that the gods swear by ,</l>
     <l n="1357">For there on either hand , as one draws nigh ,</l>
     <l n="1358">Are long-necked dragons ready for the spring ,</l>
     <l n="1359">And many another monstrous nameless thing ,</l>
     <l n="1360">The very sight of which is well-nigh death ;</l>
     <l n="1361">Then the black water as it goes crieth ,</l>
     <l n="1362">“ Fly , wretched one , before you come to die !</l>
     <l n="1363">Die , wretched man ! I will not let you fly !</l>
     <l n="1364">How have you heart to come before me here ?</l>
     <l n="1365">You have no heart , your life is turned to fear ! ”</l>
     <l n="1366">Till the wretch falls adown with whirling brain ,</l>
     <l n="1367">And far below the sharp rocks end his pain .</l>
     <l n="1368">Well then might Psyche wail her wretched fate ,</l>
     <l n="1369">And strive no more , but sitting weep and wait</l>
     <l n="1370">Alone in that black land for kindly death ,</l>
     <l n="1371">With weary sobbing , wasting life and breath ;</l>
     <l n="1372">But o'er her head there flew the bird of Jove ,</l>
     <l n="1373">The bearer of his servant , friend of Love ,</l>
     <l n="1374">Who , when he saw her , straightway towards her flew ,</l>
     <l n="1375">And asked her why she wept , and when he knew ,</l>
     <l n="1376">And who she was , he said , “ Cease all thy fear ,</l>
     <l n="1377">For to the black waves I thy ewer will bear ,</l>
     <l n="1378">And fill it for thee ; but , remember me ,</l>
     <l n="1379">When thou art come unto thy majesty . ”</l>
     <l n="1380">Then straight he flew , and through the dragon 's wings</l>
     <l n="1381">Went carelessly , nor feared their clatterings ,</l>
     <l n="1382">But set the ewer , filled , in her right hand ,</l>
     <l n="1383">And on that day saw many another land .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="41">
     <l n="1384">Then Psyche through the night toiled back again ,</l>

     <l n="1387">Yet hath she many another wile at need ;</l>
     <l n="1388">And to these days when I my life first learn ,</l>
     <l n="1389">With unavailing longing shall I turn ,</l>
     <l n="1390">When this that seemeth now so horrible</l>
     <l n="1391">Shall then seem but the threshold of her hell .</l>
     <l n="1392">Alas ! what shall I do ? for even now</l>
     <l n="1393">In sleep I see her pitiless white brow ,</l>
     <l n="1394">And hear the dreadful sound of her commands ,</l>
     <l n="1395">While with my helpless body and bound hands</l>
     <l n="1396">I tremble underneath the cruel whips ;</l>
     <l n="1397">And oft for dread of her , with quivering lips</l>
     <l n="1398">I wake , and waking know the time draws nigh</l>
     <l n="1399">When nought shall wake me from that misery —</l>
     <l n="1400">Behold , O Love , because of thee I live ,</l>

     <l n="1402">Now with the risen sun her weary feet</l>
     <l n="1403">The late-strewn roses of the floor did meet</l>
     <l n="1404">Upon the marble threshold of the place ;</l>
     <l n="1405">But she being brought before the matchless face ,</l>
     <l n="1406">Fresh with the new life of another day ,</l>
     <l n="1407">Beheld her wondering , for the goddess lay</l>
     <l n="1408">With half-shut eyes upon her golden bed ,</l>
     <l n="1409">And when she entered scarcely turned her head ,</l>
     <l n="1410">But smiling spake , “ The gods are good to thee ,</l>

     <l n="1413">Now unto Proserpine take thou thy way ,</l>
     <l n="1414">And give this golden casket to her hands ,</l>

     <l n="1432">And yet return ? and then once more it seemed</l>
     <l n="1433">The hope of mercy was but lightly dreamed ,</l>

     <l n="1604">But midmost of that water did arise</l>
     <l n="1605">A dead man , pale , with ghastly staring eyes</l>
     <l n="1606">That somewhat like her father still did seem ,</l>
     <l n="1607">But in such wise as figures in a dream ;</l>
     <l n="1608">Then with a lamentable voice it cried ,</l>
     <l n="1609">“ O daughter , I am dead , and in this tide</l>
     <l n="1610">For ever shall I drift , an unnamed thing ,</l>
     <l n="1611">Who was thy father once , a mighty king ,</l>
     <l n="1612">Unless thou take some pity on me now ,</l>
     <l n="1613">And bid the ferryman turn here his prow ,</l>
     <l n="1614">That I with thee to some abode may cross ;</l>
     <l n="1615">And little unto thee will be the loss ,</l>
     <l n="1616">And unto me the gain will be to come</l>
     <l n="1617">To such a place as I may call a home ,</l>
     <l n="1618">Being now but dead and empty of delight ,</l>
     <l n="1619">And set in this sad place ‘ twixt dark and light . ”</l>
     <l n="1620">Now at these words the tears ran down apace</l>
     <l n="1621">For memory of the once familiar face ,</l>
     <l n="1622">And those old days , wherein , a little child</l>
     <l n="1623">‘ Twixt awe and love beneath those eyes she smiled ;</l>
     <l n="1624">False pity moved her very heart , although</l>
     <l n="1625">The guile of Venus she failed not to know ,</l>
     <l n="1626">But tighter round the casket clasped her hands ,</l>
     <l n="1627">And shut her eyes , remembering the commands</l>
     <l n="1628">Of that dead queen : so safe to land she came .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="47">
     <l n="1629">And there in that grey country , like a flame</l>
     <l n="1630">Before her eyes rose up the house of gold ,</l>
     <l n="1631">And at the gate she met the beast threefold ,</l>
     <l n="1632">Who ran to meet her open-mouthed , but she</l>
     <l n="1633">Unto his jaws the cakes cast cunningly ,</l>
     <l n="1634">But trembling much ; then on the ground he lay</l>
     <l n="1635">Lolling his heads , and let her go her way ;</l>
     <l n="1636">And so she came into the mighty hall ,</l>
     <l n="1637">And saw those wonders hanging on the wall ,</l>
     <l n="1638">That all with pomegranates was covered o'er</l>
     <l n="1639">In memory of the meal on that sad shore ,</l>
     <l n="1640">Whereby fair Enna was bewept in vain ,</l>
     <l n="1641">And this became a kingdom and a chain .</l>
     <l n="1642">But on a throne , the Queen of all the dead</l>
     <l n="1643">She saw therein with gold-embracéd head ,</l>
     <l n="1644">In royal raiment , beautiful and pale ;</l>
     <l n="1645">Then with slim hands her face did Psyche veil</l>
     <l n="1646">In worship of her , who said , “ Welcome here ,</l>
     <l n="1647">O messenger of Venus ! thou art dear</l>
     <l n="1648">To me thyself indeed , for of thy grace</l>
     <l n="1649">And loveliness we know e'en in this place ;</l>
     <l n="1650">Rest thee then , fair one , on this royal bed</l>
     <l n="1651">And with some dainty food shalt thou be fed ;</l>
     <l n="1652">Ho , ye who wait , bring in the tables now ! ”</l>
     <l n="1653">Therewith were brought things glorious of show</l>
     <l n="1654">On cloths and tables royally beseen ,</l>
     <l n="1655">By damsels each one fairer than a queen ,</l>
     <l n="1656">The very latchets of whose shoes were worth</l>
     <l n="1657">The royal crown of any queen on earth ;</l>
     <l n="1658">But when upon them Psyche looked , she saw</l>
     <l n="1659">That all these dainty matters without flaw</l>
     <l n="1660">Were strange of shape and of strange-blended hues</l>
     <l n="1661">So every cup and plate did she refuse</l>
     <l n="1662">Those lovely hands brought to her , and she said ,</l>
     <l n="1663">“ O Queen , to me amidst my awe and dread</l>
     <l n="1664">These things are nought , my message is not done ,</l>
     <l n="1665">So let me rest upon this cold grey stone ,</l>
     <l n="1666">And while my eyes no higher than thy feet</l>
     <l n="1667">Are lifted , eat the food that mortals eat . ”</l>
     <l n="1668">Therewith upon the floor she sat her down</l>
     <l n="1669">And from the folded bosom of her gown</l>
     <l n="1670">Drew forth her bread and ate , while with cold eyes</l>
     <l n="1671">Regarding her ‘ twixt anger and surprise ,</l>
     <l n="1672">The Queen sat silent for awhile , then spoke ,</l>
     <l n="1673">“ Why art thou here , wisest of living folk ?</l>
     <l n="1674">Depart in haste , lest thou shouldst come to be</l>
     <l n="1675">Thyself a helpless thing and shadowy !</l>
     <l n="1676">Give me the casket then , thou need'st not say</l>
     <l n="1677">Wherefore thou thus hast passed the awful way ;</l>
     <l n="1678">Bide there , and for thy mistress shalt thou have</l>
     <l n="1679">The charm that beauty from all change can save . ”</l>
     <l n="1680">Then Psyche rose , and from her trembling hand</l>
     <l n="1681">Gave her the casket , and awhile did stand</l>
     <l n="1682">Alone within the hall , that changing light</l>
     <l n="1683">From burning streams , and shadowy waves of night</l>
     <l n="1684">Made strange and dread , till to her , standing there</l>
     <l n="1685">The world began to seem no longer fair ,</l>
     <l n="1686">Life no more to be hoped for , but that place</l>
     <l n="1687">The peaceful goal of all the hurrying race ,</l>
     <l n="1688">The house she must return to on some day .</l>
     <l n="1689">Then sighing scarcely could she turn away</l>
     <l n="1690">When with the casket came the Queen once more ,</l>
     <l n="1691">And said , “ Haste now to leave this shadowy shore</l>
     <l n="1692">Before thou changest ; even now I see</l>
     <l n="1693">Thine eyes are growing strange , thou look'st on me</l>
     <l n="1694">E'en as the linnet looks upon the snake .</l>
     <l n="1695">Behold , thy wisely-guarded treasure take ,</l>
     <l n="1696">And let thy breath of life no longer move</l>
     <l n="1697">The shadows with the memories of past love . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="48">
     <l n="1698">But Psyche at that name , with quickened heart</l>
     <l n="1699">Turned eagerly , and hastened to depart</l>
     <l n="1700">Bearing that burden , hoping for the day ;</l>
     <l n="1701">Harmless , asleep , the triple monster lay ,</l>
     <l n="1702">The ferryman did set her in his boat</l>
     <l n="1703">Unquestioned , and together did they float</l>
     <l n="1704">Over the leaden water back again :</l>
     <l n="1705">Nor saw she more those women bent with pain</l>
     <l n="1706">Over their weaving , nor the fallen ass ,</l>
     <l n="1707">But swiftly up the grey road did she pass</l>
     <l n="1708">And well-nigh now was come into the day</l>
     <l n="1709">By hollow Tænarus , but o'er the way</l>
     <l n="1710">The wings of Envy brooded all unseen ;</l>
     <l n="1711">Because indeed the cruel and fair Queen</l>
     <l n="1712">Knew well how she had sped ; so in her breast ,</l>
     <l n="1713">Against the which the dreadful box was pressed ,</l>
     <l n="1714">Grew up at last this foolish , harmful thought .</l>
     <l n="1715">“ Behold how far this beauty I have brought</l>
     <l n="1716">To give unto my bitter enemy ;</l>
     <l n="1717">Might I not still a very goddess be</l>
     <l n="1718">If this were mine which goddesses desire ,</l>
     <l n="1719">Yea , what if this hold swift consuming fire ,</l>
     <l n="1720">Why do I think it good for me to live ,</l>
     <l n="1721">That I my body once again may give</l>
     <l n="1722">Into her cruel hands — come death ! come life !</l>
     <l n="1723">And give me end to all the bitter strife ! ”</l>
     <l n="1724">Therewith down by the wayside did she sit</l>
     <l n="1725">And turned the box round , long regarding it ;</l>
     <l n="1726">But at the last , with trembling hands , undid</l>
     <l n="1727">The clasp , and fearfully raised up the lid ;</l>
     <l n="1728">But what was there she saw not , for her head</l>
     <l n="1729">Fell back , and nothing she rememberéd</l>
     <l n="1730">Of all her life , yet nought of rest she had ,</l>
     <l n="1731">The hope of which makes hapless mortals glad ;</l>
     <l n="1732">For while her limbs were sunk in deadly sleep</l>
     <l n="1733">Most like to death , over her heart ‘ gan creep</l>
     <l n="1734">Ill dreams ; so that for fear and great distress</l>
     <l n="1735">She would have cried , but in her helplessness</l>
     <l n="1736">Could open not her mouth , or frame a word ;</l>
     <l n="1737">Although the threats of mocking things she heard ,</l>
     <l n="1738">And seemed , amidst new forms of horror bound ,</l>
     <l n="1739">To watch strange endless armies moving round ,</l>
     <l n="1740">With all their sleepless eyes still fixed on her ,</l>
     <l n="1741">Who from that changeless place should never stir .</l>
     <l n="1742">Moveless she lay , and in that dreadful sleep</l>
     <l n="1743">Scarce had the strength some few slow tears to weep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="49">
     <l n="1744">And there she would have lain for evermore ,</l>
     <l n="1745">A marble image on the shadowy shore</l>
     <l n="1746">In outward seeming , but within oppressed</l>
     <l n="1747">With torments , knowing neither hope nor rest</l>
     <l n="1748">But as she lay the Phoenix flew along</l>
     <l n="1749">Going to Egypt , and knew all her wrong ,</l>
     <l n="1750">And pitied her , beholding her sweet face ,</l>
     <l n="1751">And flew to Love and told him of her case ;</l>
     <l n="1752">And Love , in guerdon of the tale he told ,</l>
     <l n="1753">Changed all the feathers of his neck to gold ,</l>
     <l n="1754">And he flew on to Egypt glad at heart .</l>
     <l n="1755">But Love himself gat swiftly for his part</l>
     <l n="1756">To rocky Tænarus , and found her there</l>
     <l n="1757">Laid half a furlong from the outer air .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="50">
     <l n="1758">But at that sight out burst the smothered flame</l>
     <l n="1759">Of love , when he remembered all her shame ,</l>
     <l n="1760">The stripes , the labour , and the wretched fear ,</l>
     <l n="1761">And kneeling down he whispered in her ear ,</l>
     <l n="1762">“ Rise , Psyche , and be mine for evermore ,</l>
     <l n="1763">For evil is long tarrying on this shore . ”</l>
     <l n="1764">Then when she heard him , straightway she arose ,</l>
     <l n="1765">And from her fell the burden of her woes ;</l>
     <l n="1766">And yet her heart within her well-nigh broke ,</l>
     <l n="1767">When she from grief to happiness awoke ;</l>
     <l n="1768">And loud her sobbing was in that grey place ,</l>
     <l n="1769">And with sweet shame she covered up her face .</l>
     <l n="1770">But her dear hands , all wet with tears , he kissed ,</l>
     <l n="1771">And taking them about each dainty wrist</l>
     <l n="1772">Drew them away , and in a sweet voice said ,</l>
     <l n="1773">“ Raise up again , O Psyche , that dear head ,</l>
     <l n="1774">And of thy simpleness have no more shame ;</l>
     <l n="1775">Thou hast been tried , and cast away all blame</l>
     <l n="1776">Into the sea of woes that thou didst bear ,</l>
     <l n="1777">The bitter pain , the hopelessness , the fear —</l>
     <l n="1778">Holpen a little , loved with boundless love</l>
     <l n="1779">Amidst them all — but now the shadows move</l>
     <l n="1780">Fast toward the west , earth 's day is well-nigh done ,</l>
     <l n="1781">One toil thou hast yet ; by to-morrow 's sun</l>
     <l n="1782">Kneel the last time before my mother 's feet ,</l>
     <l n="1783">Thy task accomplished ; and my heart , O sweet ,</l>
     <l n="1784">Shall go with thee to ease thy toilsome way ;</l>
     <l n="1785">Farewell awhile ! but that so glorious day</l>
     <l n="1786">I promised thee of old , now cometh fast ,</l>
     <l n="1787">When even hope thy soul aside shall cast ,</l>
     <l n="1788">Amidst the joy that thou shalt surely win . ”</l>
     <l n="1789">So saying , all that sleep he shut within</l>
     <l n="1790">The dreadful casket , and aloft he flew ,</l>
     <l n="1791">But slowly she unto the cavern drew</l>
     <l n="1792">Scarce knowing if she dreamed , and so she came</l>
     <l n="1793">Unto the earth where yet the sun did flame</l>
     <l n="1794">Low down between the pine-trunks , tall and red ,</l>
     <l n="1795">And with its last beams kissed her golden head .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="51">
     <l n="1796">With what words Love unto the Father prayed</l>
     <l n="1797">I know not , nor what deeds the balance weighed ;</l>

     <l n="1799">And Psyche 's life the heavenly crown shall gain ;</l>
     <l n="1800">So round about the messenger was sent</l>

     <l n="1803">But while they got them ready at his call ,</l>
     <l n="1804">On through the night was Psyche toiling still ,</l>
     <l n="1805">To whom no pain nor weariness seemed ill</l>
     <l n="1806">Since now once more she knew herself beloved ;</l>

     <l n="1814">Then at the first no word the Sea-born said ,</l>
     <l n="1815">But looked afar over her golden head ,</l>
     <l n="1816">Pondering upon the mighty deeds of fate ;</l>
     <l n="1817">While Psyche still , as one who well may wait ,</l>
     <l n="1818">Knelt , calm and motionless , nor said a word ,</l>
     <l n="1819">But ever thought of her sweet lovesome lord .</l>
     <l n="1820">At last the Queen said , “ Girl , I bid thee rise ,</l>

     <l n="1824">Although because of it , thy joy indeed</l>
     <l n="1825">Shall now be more , that pleasure is thy meed . ”</l>
     <l n="1826">Then bending , on the forehead did she kiss</l>
     <l n="1827">Fair Psyche , who turned red for shame and bliss ;</l>
     <l n="1828">But Venus smiled again on her , and said ,</l>

     <l n="1832">So thence once more was Psyche led away ,</l>

    <head>THE WRITING ON THE IMAGE .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>How on an image that stood anciently in Rome were written certain words , which none understood , until a Scholar , coming there , knew their meaning , and thereby discovered great marvels , but withal died miserably .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In half-forgotten days of old ,</l>
     <l n="2">As by our fathers we were told ,</l>
     <l n="3">Within the town of Rome there stood</l>
     <l n="4">An image cut of cornel wood ,</l>
     <l n="5">And on the upraised hand of it</l>
     <l n="6">Men might behold these letters writ :</l>
     <l n="7">“ PERCUTE HIC : ” which is to say ,</l>
     <l n="8">In that tongue that we speak to-day ,</l>
     <l n="9">“ Strike here ! ” nor yet did any know</l>
     <l n="10">The cause why this was written so .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">Thus in the middle of the square ,</l>
     <l n="12">In the hot sun and summer air ,</l>
     <l n="13">The snow-drift and the driving rain ,</l>
     <l n="14">That image stood , with little pain ,</l>
     <l n="15">For twice a hundred years and ten ;</l>
     <l n="16">While many a band of striving men</l>
     <l n="17">Were driven betwixt woe and mirth</l>
     <l n="18">Swiftly across the weary earth ,</l>
     <l n="19">From nothing unto dark nothing :</l>
     <l n="20">And many an emperor and king ,</l>
     <l n="21">Passing with glory or with shame ,</l>
     <l n="22">Left little record of his name ,</l>
     <l n="23">And no remembrance of the face</l>
     <l n="24">Once watched with awe for gifts or grace</l>
     <l n="25">Fear little , then , I counsel you ,</l>
     <l n="26">What any son of man can do ;</l>
     <l n="27">Because a log of wood will last</l>
     <l n="28">While many a life of man goes past ,</l>
     <l n="29">And all is over in short space .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="30">Now so it chanced that to this place</l>
     <l n="31">There came a man of Sicily ,</l>
     <l n="32">Who when the image he did see ,</l>
     <l n="33">Knew full well who , in days of yore ,</l>
     <l n="34">Had set it there ; for much strange lore ,</l>
     <l n="35">In Egypt and in Babylon ,</l>
     <l n="36">This man with painful toil had won ;</l>
     <l n="37">And many secret things could do ;</l>
     <l n="38">So verily full well he knew</l>
     <l n="39">That master of all sorcery</l>
     <l n="40">Who wrought the thing in days gone by ,</l>
     <l n="41">And doubted not that some great spell</l>
     <l n="42">It guarded , but could nowise tell</l>
     <l n="43">What it might be . So , day by day ,</l>
     <l n="44">Still would he loiter on the way ,</l>
     <l n="45">And watch the image carefully ,</l>
     <l n="46">Well mocked of many a passer-by .</l>
     <l n="47">And on a day he stood and gazed</l>
     <l n="48">Upon the slender finger , raised</l>
     <l n="49">Against a doubtful cloudy sky ,</l>
     <l n="50">Nigh noontide ; and thought , “ Certainly</l>
     <l n="51">The master who made thee so fair</l>
     <l n="52">By wondrous art , had not stopped there ,</l>
     <l n="53">But made thee speak , had he not thought</l>
     <l n="54">That thereby evil might be brought</l>
     <l n="55">Upon his spell . ” But as he spoke ,</l>
     <l n="56">From out a cloud the noon sun broke</l>
     <l n="57">With watery light , and shadows cold :</l>
     <l n="58">Then did the Scholar well behold</l>
     <l n="59">How , from that finger carved to tell</l>
     <l n="60">Those words , a short black shadow fell</l>
     <l n="61">Upon a certain spot of ground ,</l>
     <l n="62">And thereon , looking all around</l>
     <l n="63">And seeing none heeding , went straightway</l>
     <l n="64">Whereas the finger 's shadow lay ,</l>
     <l n="65">And with his knife about the place</l>
     <l n="66">A little circle did he trace ;</l>
     <l n="67">Then home he turned with throbbing head ,</l>
     <l n="68">And forthright gat him to his bed ,</l>
     <l n="69">And slept until the night was late</l>
     <l n="70">And few men stirred from gate to gate .</l>
     <l n="71">So when at midnight he did wake ,</l>
     <l n="72">Pickaxe and shovel did he take ,</l>
     <l n="73">And , going to that now silent square ,</l>
     <l n="74">He found the mark his knife made there ,</l>
     <l n="75">And quietly with many a stroke</l>
     <l n="76">The pavement of the place he broke :</l>
     <l n="77">And so , the stones being set apart ,</l>
     <l n="78">He ‘ gan to dig with beating heart ,</l>
     <l n="79">And from the hole in haste he cast</l>
     <l n="80">The marl and gravel ; till at last ,</l>
     <l n="81">Full shoulder high , his arms were jarred ,</l>
     <l n="82">For suddenly his spade struck hard</l>
     <l n="83">With clang against some metal thing :</l>
     <l n="84">And soon he found a brazen ring ,</l>
     <l n="85">All green with rust , twisted , and great</l>
     <l n="86">As a man 's wrist , set in a plate</l>
     <l n="87">Of copper , wrought all curiously</l>
     <l n="88">With words unknown though plain to see ,</l>
     <l n="89">Spite of the rust ; and flowering trees ,</l>
     <l n="90">And beasts , and wicked images ,</l>
     <l n="91">Whereat he shuddered : for he knew</l>
     <l n="92">What ill things he might come to do ,</l>
     <l n="93">If he should still take part with these</l>
     <l n="94">And that Great Master strive to please .</l>
     <l n="95">But small time had he then to stand</l>
     <l n="96">And think , so straight he set his hand</l>
     <l n="97">Unto the ring , but where he thought</l>
     <l n="98">That by main strength it must be brought</l>
     <l n="99">From out its place , lo ! easily</l>
     <l n="100">It came away , and let him see</l>
     <l n="101">A winding staircase wrought of stone ,</l>
     <l n="102">Wherethrough the new-come wind did moan .</l>
     <l n="103">Then thought he , “ If I come alive</l>
     <l n="104">From out this place well shall I thrive ,</l>
     <l n="105">For I may look here certainly</l>
     <l n="106">The treasures of a king to see ,</l>
     <l n="107">A mightier man than men are now .</l>
     <l n="108">So in few days what man shall know</l>
     <l n="109">The needy Scholar , seeing me</l>
     <l n="110">Great in the place where great men be ,</l>
     <l n="111">The richest man in all the land ?</l>
     <l n="112">Beside the best then shall I stand ,</l>
     <l n="113">And some unheard-of palace have ;</l>
     <l n="114">And if my soul I may not save</l>
     <l n="115">In heaven , yet here in all men 's eyes</l>
     <l n="116">Will I make some sweet paradise ,</l>
     <l n="117">With marble cloisters , and with trees</l>
     <l n="118">And bubbling wells , and fantasies ,</l>
     <l n="119">And things all men deem strange and rare ,</l>
     <l n="120">And crowds of women kind and fair ,</l>
     <l n="121">That I may see , if so I please ,</l>
     <l n="122">Laid on the flowers , or mid the trees</l>
     <l n="123">With half-clad bodies wandering .</l>
     <l n="124">There , dwelling happier than the king ,</l>
     <l n="125">What lovely days may yet be mine !</l>
     <l n="126">How shall I live with love and wine ,</l>
     <l n="127">And music , till I come to die !</l>
     <l n="128">And then —— Who knoweth certainly</l>
     <l n="129">What haps to us when we are dead ?</l>
     <l n="130">Truly I think by likelihead</l>
     <l n="131">Nought haps to us of good or bad ;</l>
     <l n="132">Therefore on earth will I be glad</l>
     <l n="133">A short space , free from hope or fear ;</l>
     <l n="134">And fearless will I enter here</l>
     <l n="135">And meet my fate , whatso it be . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="136">Now on his back a bag had he ,</l>
     <l n="137">To bear what treasure he might win ,</l>
     <l n="138">And therewith now did he begin</l>
     <l n="139">To go adown the winding stair ;</l>
     <l n="140">And found the walls all painted fair</l>
     <l n="141">With images of many a thing ,</l>
     <l n="142">Warrior and priest , and queen and king ,</l>
     <l n="143">But nothing knew what they might be .</l>
     <l n="144">Which things full clearly could he see ,</l>
     <l n="145">For lamps were hung up here and there</l>
     <l n="146">Of strange device , but wrought right fair ,</l>
     <l n="147">And pleasant savour came from them .</l>
     <l n="148">At last a curtain , on whose hem</l>
     <l n="149">Unknown words in red gold were writ ,</l>
     <l n="150">He reached , and softly raising it</l>
     <l n="151">Stepped back , for now did he behold</l>
     <l n="152">A goodly hall hung round with gold ,</l>
     <l n="153">And at the upper end could see</l>
     <l n="154">Sitting , a glorious company :</l>
     <l n="155">Therefore he trembled , thinking well</l>
     <l n="156">They were no men , but fiends of hell .</l>
     <l n="157">But while he waited , trembling sore ,</l>
     <l n="158">And doubtful of his late-earned lore ,</l>
     <l n="159">A cold blast of the outer air</l>
     <l n="160">Blew out the lamps upon the stair</l>
     <l n="161">And all was dark behind him ; then</l>
     <l n="162">Did he fear less to face those men</l>
     <l n="163">Than , turning round , to leave them there</l>
     <l n="164">While he went groping up the stair .</l>
     <l n="165">Yea , since he heard no cry or call</l>
     <l n="166">Or any speech from them at all ,</l>
     <l n="167">He doubted they were images</l>
     <l n="168">Set there some dying king to please</l>
     <l n="169">By that Great Master of the art ;</l>
     <l n="170">Therefore at last with stouter heart</l>
     <l n="171">He raised the cloth and entered in</l>
     <l n="172">In hope that happy life to win ,</l>
     <l n="173">And drawing nigher did behold</l>
     <l n="174">That these were bodies dead and cold</l>
     <l n="175">Attired in full royal guise ,</l>
     <l n="176">And wrought by art in such a wise</l>
     <l n="177">That living they all seemed to be ,</l>
     <l n="178">Whose very eyes he well could see ,</l>
     <l n="179">That now beheld not foul or fair ,</l>
     <l n="180">Shining as though alive they were .</l>
     <l n="181">And midmost of that company</l>
     <l n="182">An ancient king that man could see ,</l>
     <l n="183">A mighty man , whose beard of grey</l>
     <l n="184">A foot over his gold gown lay ;</l>
     <l n="185">And next beside him sat his queen</l>
     <l n="186">Who in a flowery gown of green</l>
     <l n="187">And golden mantle well was clad ,</l>
     <l n="188">And on her neck a collar had</l>
     <l n="189">Too heavy for her dainty breast ;</l>
     <l n="190">Her loins by such a belt were prest</l>
     <l n="191">That whoso in his treasury</l>
     <l n="192">Held that alone , a king might be .</l>
     <l n="193">On either side of these , a lord</l>
     <l n="194">Stood heedfully before the board ,</l>
     <l n="195">And in their hands held bread and wine</l>
     <l n="196">For service ; behind these did shine</l>
     <l n="197">The armour of the guards , and then</l>
     <l n="198">The well-attiréd serving-men ,</l>
     <l n="199">The minstrels clad in raiment meet ;</l>
     <l n="200">And over against the royal seat</l>
     <l n="201">Was hung a lamp , although no flame</l>
     <l n="202">Was burning there , but there was set</l>
     <l n="203">Within its open golden fret</l>
     <l n="204">A huge carbuncle , red and bright ;</l>
     <l n="205">Wherefrom there shone forth such a light</l>
     <l n="206">That great hall was as clear by it ,</l>
     <l n="207">As though by wax it had been lit ,</l>
     <l n="208">As some great church at Easter-tide .</l>
     <l n="209">Now set a little way aside ,</l>
     <l n="210">Six paces from the daïs stood</l>
     <l n="211">An image made of brass and wood ,</l>
     <l n="212">In likeness of a full-armed knight</l>
     <l n="213">Who pointed ‘ gainst the ruddy light</l>
     <l n="214">A huge shaft ready in a bow .</l>
     <l n="215">Pondering how he could come to know</l>
     <l n="216">What all these marvellous matters meant ,</l>
     <l n="217">About the hall the Scholar went ,</l>
     <l n="218">Trembling , though nothing moved as yet ;</l>
     <l n="219">And for awhile did he forget</l>
     <l n="220">The longings that had brought him there</l>
     <l n="221">In wondering at these marvels fair ;</l>
     <l n="222">And still for fear he doubted much</l>
     <l n="223">One jewel of their robes to touch .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="224">But as about the hall he passed</l>
     <l n="225">He grew more used to them at last ,</l>
     <l n="226">And thought , “ Swiftly the time goes by ,</l>
     <l n="227">And now no doubt the day draws nigh</l>
     <l n="228">Folk will be stirring : by my head</l>
     <l n="229">A fool I am to fear the dead ,</l>
     <l n="230">Who have seen living things enow ,</l>
     <l n="231">Whose very names no man can know ,</l>
     <l n="232">Whose shapes brave men might well affright</l>
     <l n="233">More than the lion in the night</l>
     <l n="234">Wandering for food ; ” therewith he drew</l>
     <l n="235">Unto those royal corpses two ,</l>
     <l n="236">That on dead brows still wore the crown ;</l>
     <l n="237">And midst the golden cups set down</l>
     <l n="238">The rugged wallet from his back ,</l>
     <l n="239">Patched of strong leather , brown and black .</l>
     <l n="240">Then , opening wide its mouth , took up</l>
     <l n="241">From off the board , a golden cup</l>
     <l n="242">The King 's dead hand was laid upon ,</l>
     <l n="243">Whose unmoved eyes upon him shone</l>
     <l n="244">And recked no more of that last shame</l>
     <l n="245">Than if he were the beggar lame ,</l>
     <l n="246">Who in old days was wont to wait</l>
     <l n="247">For a dog 's meal beside the gate .</l>
     <l n="248">Of which shame nought our man did reck .</l>
     <l n="249">But laid his hand upon the neck</l>
     <l n="250">Of the slim Queen , and thence undid</l>
     <l n="251">The jewelled collar , that straight slid</l>
     <l n="252">Down her smooth bosom to the board .</l>
     <l n="253">And when these matters he had stored</l>
     <l n="254">Safe in his sack , with both their crowns ,</l>
     <l n="255">The jewelled parts of their rich gowns ,</l>
     <l n="256">Their shoes and belts , brooches and rings ,</l>
     <l n="257">And cleared the board of all rich things ,</l>
     <l n="258">He staggered with them down the hall .</l>
     <l n="259">But as he went his eyes did fall</l>
     <l n="260">Upon a wonderful green stone ,</l>
     <l n="261">Upon the hall-floor laid alone ;</l>
     <l n="262">He said , “ Though thou art not so great</l>
     <l n="263">To add by much unto the weight</l>
     <l n="264">Of this my sack indeed , yet thou ,</l>
     <l n="265">Certes , would make me rich enow ,</l>
     <l n="266">That verily with thee I might</l>
     <l n="267">Wage one-half of the world to fight</l>
     <l n="268">The other half of it , and I</l>
     <l n="269">The lord of all the world might die ;—</l>
     <l n="270">I will not leave thee ; ” therewithal</l>
     <l n="271">He knelt down midmost of the hall ,</l>
     <l n="272">Thinking it would come easily</l>
     <l n="273">Into his hand ; but when that he</l>
     <l n="274">Gat hold of it , full fast it stack ,</l>
     <l n="275">So fuming , down he laid his sack ,</l>
     <l n="276">And with both hands pulled lustily ,</l>
     <l n="277">But as he strained , he cast his eye</l>
     <l n="278">Back to the daïs ; there he saw</l>
     <l n="279">The bowman image ‘ gin to draw</l>
     <l n="280">The mighty bowstring to his ear ,</l>
     <l n="281">So , shrieking out aloud for fear ,</l>
     <l n="282">Of that rich stone he loosed his hold</l>
     <l n="283">And catching up his bag of gold ,</l>
     <l n="284">Gat to his feet : but ere he stood</l>
     <l n="285">The evil thing of brass and wood</l>
     <l n="286">Up to his ear the notches drew ;</l>
     <l n="287">And clanging , forth the arrow flew ,</l>
     <l n="288">And midmost of the carbuncle</l>
     <l n="289">Clanging again , the forked barbs fell ,</l>
     <l n="290">And all was dark as pitch straightway .</l>

     <l n="11">By this sweet stream that knows not of the sea ,</l>
     <l n="12">That guesses not the city 's misery ,</l>
     <l n="13">This little stream whose hamlets scarce have names ,</l>

     <l n="22">Now in the early June they deemed it good</l>

     <l n="24">On their chief river , so upon a day</l>
     <l n="25">With favouring wind and tide they took their way</l>
     <l n="26">Up the fair stream ; most lovely was the time</l>
     <l n="27">Even amidst the days of that fair clime ,</l>
     <l n="28">And still the wanderers thought about their lives ,</l>

     <l n="38">And they with rest , and pleasure , and old wine ,</l>
     <l n="39">Began to feel immortal and divine ,</l>
     <l n="40">An elder spoke , “ O gentle friends , the day</l>

    <head>THE LOVE OF ALCESTIS .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Admetus , King of Pheræ in Thessaly , received unwittingly Apollo as his</l>
     <l n="2">servant , by the help of whom he won to wife Alcestis , daughter of</l>
     <l n="3">Pelias : afterwards too , as in other things , so principally in this ,</l>
     <l n="4">Apollo gave him help , that when he came to die , he obtained of the</l>
     <l n="5">Fates for him , that if another would die willingly in his stead , then</l>
     <l n="6">he should live still ; and when to every one else this seemed</l>
     <l n="7">impossible , Alcestis gave her life for her husband 's .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">Midst sunny grass-clad meads that slope adown</l>
     <l n="9">To lake Boebeis stands an ancient town ,</l>
     <l n="10">Where dwelt of old a lord of Thessaly ,</l>
     <l n="11">The son of Pheres and fair Clymene ,</l>
     <l n="12">Who had to name Admetus : long ago</l>
     <l n="13">The dwellers by the lake have ceased to know</l>
     <l n="14">His name , because the world grows old , but then</l>
     <l n="15">He was accounted great among great men ;</l>
     <l n="16">Young , strong , and godlike , lacking nought at all</l>
     <l n="17">Of gifts that unto royal men might fall</l>
     <l n="18">In those old simple days , before men went</l>
     <l n="19">To gather unseen harm and discontent ,</l>
     <l n="20">Along with all the alien merchandise</l>
     <l n="21">That rich folk need , too restless to be wise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="22">Now on the fairest of all autumn eves ,</l>
     <l n="23">When midst the dusty , crumpled , dying leaves</l>
     <l n="24">The black grapes showed , and every press and vat</l>
     <l n="25">Was newly scoured , this King Admetus sat</l>
     <l n="26">Among his people , wearied in such wise</l>
     <l n="27">By hopeful toil as makes a paradise</l>
     <l n="28">Of the rich earth ; for light and far away</l>
     <l n="29">Seemed all the labour of the coming day ,</l>
     <l n="30">And no man wished for more than then he had ,</l>
     <l n="31">Nor with another 's mourning was made glad .</l>
     <l n="32">There in the pillared porch , their supper done ,</l>
     <l n="33">They watched the fair departing of the sun ;</l>
     <l n="34">The while the soft-eyed well-girt maidens poured</l>
     <l n="35">The joy of life from out the jars long stored</l>
     <l n="36">Deep in the earth , while little like a king ,</l>
     <l n="37">As we call kings , but glad with everything ,</l>
     <l n="38">The wise Thessalian sat and blessed his life ,</l>
     <l n="39">So free from sickening fear and foolish strife .</l>
     <l n="40">But midst the joy of this festivity ,</l>
     <l n="41">Turning aside he saw a man draw nigh ,</l>
     <l n="42">Along the dusty grey vine-bordered road</l>
     <l n="43">That had its ending at his fair abode ;</l>
     <l n="44">He seemed e'en from afar to set his face</l>
     <l n="45">Unto the King 's adornéd reverend place ,</l>
     <l n="46">And like a traveller went he wearily ,</l>
     <l n="47">And yet as one who seems his rest to see .</l>
     <l n="48">A staff he bore , but nowise was he bent</l>
     <l n="49">With scrip or wallet ; so withal he went</l>
     <l n="50">Straight to the King 's high seat , and standing near ,</l>
     <l n="51">Seemed a stout youth and noble , free from fear ,</l>
     <l n="52">But peaceful and unarmed ; and though ill clad ,</l>
     <l n="53">And though the dust of that hot land he had</l>
     <l n="54">Upon his limbs and face , as fair was he</l>
     <l n="55">As any king 's son you might lightly see ,</l>
     <l n="56">Grey-eyed and crisp-haired , beautiful of limb ,</l>
     <l n="57">And no ill eye the women cast on him .</l>
     <l n="58">But kneeling now , and stretching forth his hand ,</l>
     <l n="59">He said , “ O thou , the king of this fair land ,</l>
     <l n="60">Unto a banished man some shelter give ,</l>
     <l n="61">And help me with thy goods that I may live :</l>
     <l n="62">Thou hast good store , Admetus , yet may I ,</l>
     <l n="63">Who kneel before thee now in misery ,</l>
     <l n="64">Give thee more gifts before the end shall come</l>
     <l n="65">Than all thou hast laid safely in thine home . ”</l>
     <l n="66">“ Rise up , and be my guest , ” Admetus said ,</l>
     <l n="67">“ I need no gifts for this poor gift of bread ,</l>
     <l n="68">The land is wide , and bountiful enow .</l>
     <l n="69">What thou canst do , to-morrow thou shalt show ,</l>
     <l n="70">And be my man , perchance ; but this night rest</l>
     <l n="71">Not questioned more than any passing guest .</l>
     <l n="72">Yea , even if a great king thou hast spilt ,</l>
     <l n="73">Thou shall not answer aught but as thou wilt . ”</l>
     <l n="74">Then the man rose and said , “ O King , indeed</l>
     <l n="75">Of thine awarded silence have I need ,</l>
     <l n="76">Nameless I am , nameless what I have done</l>
     <l n="77">Must be through many circles of the sun .</l>
     <l n="78">But for to-morrow — let me rather tell</l>
     <l n="79">On this same eve what things I can do well ,</l>
     <l n="80">And let me put mine hand in thine and swear</l>
     <l n="81">To serve thee faithfully a changing year ;</l>
     <l n="82">Nor think the woods of Ossa hold one beast</l>
     <l n="83">That of thy tenderest yearling shall make feast ,</l>
     <l n="84">Whiles that I guard thy flocks , and thou shalt bear</l>
     <l n="85">Thy troubles easier when thou com'st to hear</l>
     <l n="86">The music I can make . Let these thy men</l>
     <l n="87">Witness against me if I fail thee , when</l>
     <l n="88">War falls upon thy lovely land and thee . ”</l>
     <l n="89">Then the King smiled , and said , “ So let it be ,</l>
     <l n="90">Well shalt thou serve me , doing far less than this ,</l>
     <l n="91">Nor for thy service due gifts shalt thou miss :</l>
     <l n="92">Behold I take thy faith with thy right hand ,</l>
     <l n="93">Be thou true man unto this guarded land .</l>
     <l n="94">Ho ye ! take this my guest , find raiment meet</l>
     <l n="95">Wherewith to clothe him ; bathe his wearied feet ,</l>
     <l n="96">And bring him back beside my throne to feast . ”</l>
     <l n="97">But to himself he said , “ I am the least</l>
     <l n="98">Of all Thessalians if this man was born</l>
     <l n="99">In any earthly dwelling more forlorn</l>
     <l n="100">Than a king 's palace . ”</l>
     <l n="101">Then a damsel slim</l>
     <l n="102">Led him inside , nought loth to go with him ,</l>
     <l n="103">And when the cloud of steam had curled to meet</l>
     <l n="104">Within the brass his wearied dusty feet ,</l>
     <l n="105">She from a carved press brought him linen fair ,</l>
     <l n="106">And a new-woven coat a king might wear ,</l>
     <l n="107">And so being clad he came unto the feast ,</l>
     <l n="108">But as he came again , all people ceased</l>
     <l n="109">What talk they held soever , for they thought</l>
     <l n="110">A very god among them had been brought ;</l>
     <l n="111">And doubly glad the king Admetus was</l>
     <l n="112">At what that dying eve had brought to pass ,</l>
     <l n="113">And bade him sit by him and feast his fill .</l>
     <l n="114">So there they sat till all the world was still ,</l>
     <l n="115">And ‘ twixt the pillars their red torches ’ shine</l>
     <l n="116">Held forth unto the night a joyous sign .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="117">So henceforth did this man at Pheræ dwell ,</l>
     <l n="118">And what he set his hand to wrought right well ,</l>
     <l n="119">And won much praise and love in everything ,</l>
     <l n="120">And came to rule all herdsmen of the King ;</l>
     <l n="121">But for two things in chief his fame did grow ;</l>
     <l n="122">And first that he was better with the bow</l>
     <l n="123">Than any ‘ twixt Olympus and the sea ,</l>
     <l n="124">And then that sweet , heart-piercing melody</l>
     <l n="125">He drew out from the rigid-seeming lyre ,</l>
     <l n="126">And made the circle round the winter fire</l>
     <l n="127">More like to heaven than gardens of the May .</l>
     <l n="128">So many a heavy thought he chased away</l>
     <l n="129">From the King 's heart , and softened many a hate ,</l>
     <l n="130">And choked the spring of many a harsh debate ;</l>
     <l n="131">And , taught by wounds , the snatchers of the wolds</l>
     <l n="132">Lurked round the gates of less well-guarded folds .</l>
     <l n="133">Therefore Admetus loved him , yet withal ,</l>
     <l n="134">Strange doubts and fears upon his heart did fall ;</l>
     <l n="135">For morns there were when he the man would meet ,</l>
     <l n="136">His hair wreathed round with bay and blossoms sweet ,</l>
     <l n="137">Gazing distraught into the brightening east ,</l>
     <l n="138">Nor taking heed of either man or beast ,</l>
     <l n="139">Or anything that was upon the earth .</l>
     <l n="140">Or sometimes , midst the hottest of the mirth ,</l>
     <l n="141">Within the King 's hall , would he seem to wake</l>
     <l n="142">As from a dream , and his stringed tortoise take</l>
     <l n="143">And strike the cords unbidden , till the hall</l>
     <l n="144">Filled with the glorious sound from wall to wall ,</l>
     <l n="145">Trembled and seemed as it would melt away ,</l>
     <l n="146">And sunken down the faces weeping lay</l>
     <l n="147">That erewhile laughed the loudest ; only he</l>
     <l n="148">Stood upright , looking forward steadily</l>
     <l n="149">With sparkling eyes as one who cannot weep ,</l>
     <l n="150">Until the storm of music sank to sleep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="151">But this thing seemed the doubtfullest of all</l>
     <l n="152">Unto the King , that should there chance to fall</l>
     <l n="153">A festal day , and folk did sacrifice</l>
     <l n="154">Unto the gods , ever by some device</l>
     <l n="155">The man would be away : yet with all this</l>
     <l n="156">His presence doubled all Admetus ’ bliss ,</l>
     <l n="157">And happy in all things he seemed to live ,</l>
     <l n="158">And great gifts to his herdsman did he give .</l>
     <l n="159">But now the year came round again to spring ,</l>
     <l n="160">And southward to Iolchos went the King ;</l>
     <l n="161">For there did Pelias hold a sacrifice</l>
     <l n="162">Unto the gods , and put forth things of price</l>
     <l n="163">For men to strive for in the people 's sight ;</l>
     <l n="164">So on a morn of April , fresh and bright ,</l>
     <l n="165">Admetus shook the golden-studded reins ,</l>
     <l n="166">And soon from windings of the sweet-banked lanes</l>
     <l n="167">The south wind blew the sound of hoof and wheel ,</l>
     <l n="168">Clatter of brazen shields and clink of steel</l>
     <l n="169">Unto the herdsman 's ears , who stood awhile</l>
     <l n="170">Hearkening the echoes with a godlike smile ,</l>
     <l n="171">Then slowly gat him foldwards , murmuring ,</l>
     <l n="172">“ Fair music for the wooing of a King . ”</l>
     <l n="173">But in six days again Admetus came ,</l>
     <l n="174">With no lost labour or dishonoured name ;</l>
     <l n="175">A scarlet cloak upon his back he bare</l>
     <l n="176">A gold crown on his head , a falchion fair</l>
     <l n="177">Girt to his side ; behind him four white steeds ,</l>
     <l n="178">Whose dams had fed full in Nisæan meads ;</l>
     <l n="179">All prizes that his valiant hands had won</l>
     <l n="180">Within the guarded lists of Tyro 's son .</l>
     <l n="181">Yet midst the sound of joyous minstrelsy</l>
     <l n="182">No joyous man in truth he seemed to be ;</l>
     <l n="183">So that folk looking on him said , “ Behold ,</l>
     <l n="184">The wise King will not show himself too bold</l>
     <l n="185">Amidst his greatness : the gods too are great ,</l>
     <l n="186">And who can tell the dreadful ways of fate ? ”</l>
     <l n="187">Howe'er it was , he gat him through the town ,</l>
     <l n="188">And midst their shouts at last he lighted down</l>
     <l n="189">At his own house , and held high feast that night ;</l>
     <l n="190">And yet by seeming had but small delight</l>
     <l n="191">In aught that any man could do or say :</l>
     <l n="192">And on the morrow , just at dawn of day ,</l>
     <l n="193">Rose up and clad himself , and took his spear .</l>
     <l n="194">And in the fresh and blossom-scented air</l>
     <l n="195">Went wandering till he reach Boebeis ’ shore ;</l>
     <l n="196">Yet by his troubled face set little store</l>
     <l n="197">By all the songs of birds and scent of flowers ;</l>
     <l n="198">Yea , rather unto him the fragrant hours</l>
     <l n="199">Were grown but dull and empty of delight .</l>
     <l n="200">So going , at the last he came in sight</l>
     <l n="201">Of his new herdsman , who that morning lay</l>
     <l n="202">Close by the white sand of a little bay</l>
     <l n="203">The teeming ripple of Boebeis lapped ;</l>
     <l n="204">There he in cloak of white-wooled sheepskin wrapped</l>
     <l n="205">Against the cold dew , free from trouble sang ,</l>
     <l n="206">The while the heifers ’ bells about him rang</l>
     <l n="207">And mingled with the sweet soft-throated birds</l>
     <l n="208">And bright fresh ripple : listen , then , these words</l>
     <l n="209">Will tell the tale of his felicity ,</l>
     <l n="210">Halting and void of music though they be .</l>

     <l n="1">O Dwellers on the lovely earth ,</l>
     <l n="2">Why will ye break your rest and mirth</l>
     <l n="3">To weary us with fruitless prayer ;</l>
     <l n="4">Why will ye toil and take such care</l>
     <l n="5">For children 's children yet unborn ,</l>
     <l n="6">And garner store of strife and scorn</l>
     <l n="7">To gain a scarce-remembered name ,</l>
     <l n="8">Cumbered with lies and soiled with shame ?</l>
     <l n="9">And if the gods care not for you ,</l>
     <l n="10">What is this folly ye must do</l>
     <l n="11">To win some mortal 's feeble heart ?</l>
     <l n="12">O fools ! when each man plays his part ,</l>
     <l n="13">And heeds his fellow little more</l>
     <l n="14">Than these blue waves that kiss the shore</l>
     <l n="15">Take heed of how the daisies grow .</l>
     <l n="16">O fools ! and if ye could but know</l>
     <l n="17">How fair a world to you is given .</l>

     <l n="18">O brooder on the hills of heaven ,</l>
     <l n="19">When for my sin thou drav'st me forth ,</l>
     <l n="20">Hadst thou forgot what this was worth ,</l>
     <l n="21">Thine own hand had made ? The tears of men ,</l>
     <l n="22">The death of threescore years and ten ,</l>
     <l n="23">The trembling of the timorous race —</l>
     <l n="24">Had these things so bedimmed the place</l>
     <l n="25">Thine own hand made , thou couldst not know</l>
     <l n="26">To what a heaven the earth might grow</l>
     <l n="27">If fear beneath the earth were laid ,</l>

     <l n="29">He stopped , for he beheld his wandering lord ,</l>
     <l n="30">Who , drawing near , heard little of his word ,</l>
     <l n="31">And noted less ; for in that haggard mood</l>
     <l n="32">Nought could he do but o'er his sorrows brood ,</l>
     <l n="33">Whate'er they were , but now being come anigh ,</l>
     <l n="34">He lifted up his drawn face suddenly ,</l>
     <l n="35">And as the singer gat him to his feet ,</l>
     <l n="36">His eyes Admetus ’ troubled eyes did meet ,</l>
     <l n="37">As with some speech he now seemed labouring ,</l>
     <l n="38">Which from his heart his lips refused to bring .</l>
     <l n="39">Then spoke the herdsman , “ Master , what is this ,</l>
     <l n="40">That thou , returned with honour to the bliss ,</l>
     <l n="41">The gods have given thee here , still makest show</l>

     <l n="43">What wilt thou have ? What help there is in me</l>
     <l n="44">Is wholly thine , for in felicity</l>
     <l n="45">Within thine house thou still hast let me live ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="47">“ Yea , ” said Admetus , “ thou canst help indeed ,</l>
     <l n="48">But as the spring shower helps the unsown mead .</l>
     <l n="49">Yet listen : at Iolchos the first day</l>
     <l n="50">Unto Diana 's house I took my way ,</l>
     <l n="51">Where all men gathered ere the games began ,</l>
     <l n="52">There , at the right side of the royal man ,</l>
     <l n="53">Who rules Iolchos , did his daughter stand ,</l>
     <l n="54">Who with a suppliant bough in her right hand</l>
     <l n="55">Headed the band of maidens ; but to me</l>
     <l n="56">More than a goddess did she seem to be ,</l>
     <l n="57">Nor fit to die ; and therewithal I thought</l>
     <l n="58">That we had all been thither called for nought</l>
     <l n="59">But that her bridegroom Pelias might choose ,</l>
     <l n="60">And with that thought desire did I let loose ,</l>
     <l n="61">And striving not with Love , I gazed my fill ,</l>
     <l n="62">As one who will not fear the coming ill :</l>
     <l n="63">All , foolish were mine eyes , foolish my heart ,</l>
     <l n="64">To strive in such a marvel to have part !</l>
     <l n="65">What god shall wed her rather ? no more fear</l>
     <l n="66">Than vexes Pallas vexed her forehead clear ,</l>
     <l n="67">Faith shone from out her eyes , and on her lips</l>
     <l n="68">Unknown love trembled ; the Phoenician ships</l>
     <l n="69">Within their dark holds nought so precious bring</l>
     <l n="70">As her soft golden hair , no daintiest thing</l>
     <l n="71">I ever saw was half so wisely wrought</l>
     <l n="72">As was her rosy ear ; beyond all thought ,</l>
     <l n="73">All words to tell of , her veiled body showed ,</l>
     <l n="74">As , by the image of the Three-formed bowed ,</l>
     <l n="75">She laid her offering down ; then I drawn near</l>
     <l n="76">The murmuring of her gentle voice could hear ,</l>
     <l n="77">As waking one hears music in the morn ,</l>
     <l n="78">Ere yet the fair June sun is fully born ;</l>
     <l n="79">And sweeter than the roses fresh with dew</l>
     <l n="80">Sweet odours floated round me , as she drew</l>
     <l n="81">Some golden thing from out her balmy breast</l>
     <l n="82">With her right hand , the while her left hand pressed</l>
     <l n="83">The hidden wonders of her girdlestead ;</l>
     <l n="84">And when abashed I sank adown my head ,</l>
     <l n="85">Dreading the god of Love , my eyes must meet</l>
     <l n="86">The happy bands about her perfect feet .</l>
     <l n="87">“ What more ? thou know'st perchance what thing love is ?</l>
     <l n="88">Kindness , and hot desire , and rage , and bliss ,</l>
     <l n="89">None first a moment ; but before that day</l>
     <l n="90">No love I knew but what might pass away</l>
     <l n="91">When hot desire was changed to certainty ,</l>
     <l n="92">Or not abide much longer ; e'en such stings</l>
     <l n="93">Had smitten me , as the first warm day brings</l>
     <l n="94">When March is dying ; but now half a god</l>
     <l n="95">The crowded way unto the lists I trod ,</l>
     <l n="96">Yet hopeless as a vanquished god at whiles ,</l>
     <l n="97">And hideous seemed the laughter and the smiles ,</l>
     <l n="98">And idle talk about me on the way .</l>
     <l n="99">“ But none could stand before me on that day ,</l>
     <l n="100">I was as god-possessed , not knowing how</l>
     <l n="101">The King had brought her forth but for a show ,</l>
     <l n="102">To make his glory greater through the land :</l>
     <l n="103">Therefore at last victorious did I stand</l>
     <l n="104">Among my peers , nor yet one well-known name</l>
     <l n="105">Had gathered any honour from my shame .</l>
     <l n="106">For there indeed both men of Thessaly ,</l>
     <l n="107">Oetolians , Thebans , dwellers by the sea ,</l>
     <l n="108">And folk of Attica and Argolis ,</l>
     <l n="109">Arcadian woodmen , islanders , whose bliss</l>
     <l n="110">Is to be tossed about from wave to wave ,</l>
     <l n="111">All these at last to me the honour gave ,</l>
     <l n="112">Nor did they grudge it : yea , and one man said ,</l>
     <l n="113">A wise Thessalian with a snowy head ,</l>
     <l n="114">And voice grown thin with age , ‘ O Pelias ,</l>
     <l n="115">Surely to thee no evil thing it was</l>
     <l n="116">That to thy house this rich Thessalian</l>
     <l n="117">Should come , to prove himself a valiant man</l>
     <l n="118">Amongst these heroes ; for if I be wise</l>
     <l n="119">By dint of many years , with wistful eyes</l>
     <l n="120">Doth he behold thy daughter , this fair maid ;</l>
     <l n="121">And surely , if the matter were well weighed ,</l>
     <l n="122">Good were it both for thee and for the land</l>
     <l n="123">That he should take the damsel by the hand</l>
     <l n="124">And lead her hence , for ye near neighbours dwell ;</l>
     <l n="125">What sayest thou , King , have I said ill or well ? ’</l>
     <l n="126">“ With that must I , a fool , stand forth and ask</l>
     <l n="127">If yet there lay before me some great task</l>
     <l n="128">That I must do ere I the maid should wed ,</l>
     <l n="129">But Pelias , looking on us , smiled and said ,</l>
     <l n="130">‘ O neighbour of Larissa , and thou too ,</l>
     <l n="131">O King Admetus , this may seem to you</l>
     <l n="132">A little matter ; yea , and for my part</l>
     <l n="133">E'en such a marriage would make glad my heart ;</l>
     <l n="134">But we the blood of Salmoneus who share</l>
     <l n="135">With godlike gifts great burdens also bear ,</l>
     <l n="136">Nor is this maid without them , for the day</l>
     <l n="137">On which her maiden zone she puts away</l>
     <l n="138">Shall be her death-day , if she wed with one</l>
     <l n="139">By whom this marvellous thing may not be done ,</l>
     <l n="140">For in the traces neither must steeds paw</l>
     <l n="141">Before my threshold , or white oxen draw</l>
     <l n="142">The wain that comes my maid to take from me ,</l>
     <l n="143">Far other beasts that day her slaves must be :</l>
     <l n="144">The yellow lion ‘ neath the lash must roar ,</l>
     <l n="145">And by his side unscared , the forest boar</l>
     <l n="146">Toil at the draught : what sayest thou then hereto ,</l>
     <l n="147">O lord of Pheræ , wilt thou come to woo</l>
     <l n="148">In such a chariot , and win endless fame ,</l>
     <l n="149">Or turn thine eyes elsewhere with little shame ? ’</l>
     <l n="150">“ What answered I ? O herdsman , I was mad</l>
     <l n="151">With sweet love and the triumph I had had .</l>
     <l n="152">I took my father 's ring from off my hand ,</l>
     <l n="153">And said , ‘ O heroes of the Grecian land ,</l>
     <l n="154">Be witnesses that on my father 's name</l>
     <l n="155">For this man 's promise , do I take the shame</l>
     <l n="156">Of this deed undone , if I fail herein ;</l>
     <l n="157">Fear not , O Pelias , but that I shall win</l>
     <l n="158">This ring from thee , when I shall come again</l>
     <l n="159">Through fair Iolchos , driving that strange wain .</l>
     <l n="160">Else by this token , thou , O King , shalt have</l>
     <l n="161">Pheræ my home , while on the tumbling wave</l>
     <l n="162">A hollow ship my sad abode shall be . ’</l>
     <l n="163">“ So driven by some hostile deity ,</l>
     <l n="164">Such words I said , and with my gifts hard won ,</l>
     <l n="165">But little valued now , set out upon</l>
     <l n="166">My homeward way : but nearer as I drew</l>
     <l n="167">To mine abode , and ever fainter grew</l>
     <l n="168">In my weak heart the image of my love ,</l>
     <l n="169">In vain with fear my boastful folly strove ;</l>
     <l n="170">For I remembered that no god I was</l>
     <l n="171">Though I had chanced my fellows to surpass ;</l>
     <l n="172">And I began to mind me in a while</l>
     <l n="173">What murmur rose , with what a mocking smile</l>
     <l n="174">Pelias stretched out his hand to take the ring .</l>
     <l n="175">Made by my drunkard 's gift now twice a king :</l>
     <l n="176">And when unto my palace-door I came</l>
     <l n="177">I had awakened fully to my shame ;</l>
     <l n="178">For certainly no help is left to me ,</l>
     <l n="179">But I must get me down unto the sea</l>
     <l n="180">And build a keel , and whatso things I may</l>
     <l n="181">Set in her hold , and cross the watery way</l>
     <l n="182">Whither Jove bids , and the rough winds may blow</l>
     <l n="183">Unto a land where none my folly know ,</l>

     <l n="203">Then , sighing , turned about , and homeward bent</l>
     <l n="204">His lingering steps , and hope began to spring</l>
     <l n="205">Within his heart , for some betokening</l>

     <l n="216">At point to go a-shipboard , and to leave</l>
     <l n="217">Whatever from his sire he did receive</l>
     <l n="218">Of land or kingship ; and withal he dreamed</l>
     <l n="219">That through the cordage a bright light there gleamed</l>
     <l n="220">Far off within the east ; and nowise sad</l>
     <l n="221">He felt at leaving all he might have had ,</l>

     <l n="226">And from the gangway thrust the ship aside ,</l>
     <l n="227">Until he hung over a chasm wide</l>
     <l n="228">Vocal with furious waves , yet had no fear</l>
     <l n="229">For all the varied tumult he might hear ,</l>
     <l n="230">But slowly woke up to the morning light</l>
     <l n="231">That to his eyes seemed past all memory bright ,</l>
     <l n="232">And then strange sounds he heard , whereat his heart</l>
     <l n="233">Woke up to joyous life with one glad start ,</l>
     <l n="234">And nigh his bed he saw the herdsman stand ,</l>
     <l n="235">Holding a long white staff in his right hand ,</l>
     <l n="236">Carved with strange figures ; and withal he said ,</l>
     <l n="237">“ Awake , Admetus ! loiter not a-bed ,</l>
     <l n="238">But haste thee to bring home thy promised bride ,</l>
     <l n="239">For now an ivory chariot waits outside ,</l>
     <l n="240">Yoked to such beasts as Pelias bade thee bring ;</l>
     <l n="241">Whose guidance thou shalt find an easy thing ,</l>
     <l n="242">If in thine hands thou holdest still this rod ,</l>
     <l n="243">Whereon are carved the names of every god</l>
     <l n="244">That rules the fertile earth ; but having come</l>
     <l n="245">Unto King Pelias ’ well-adornéd home ,</l>
     <l n="246">Abide not long , but take the royal maid ,</l>
     <l n="247">And let her dowry in thy wain be laid ,</l>
     <l n="248">Of silver and fine cloth and unmixed gold ,</l>
     <l n="249">For this indeed will Pelias not withhold</l>
     <l n="250">When he shall see thee like a very god .</l>
     <l n="251">Then let thy beasts , ruled by this carven rod ,</l>
     <l n="252">Turn round to Pheræ ; yet must thou abide</l>
     <l n="253">Before thou comest to the streamlet 's side</l>
     <l n="254">That feed its dykes ; there , by the little wood</l>
     <l n="255">Wherein unto Diana men shed blood ,</l>
     <l n="256">Will I await thee , and thou shalt descend</l>
     <l n="257">And hand-in-hand afoot through Pheræ wend ;</l>
     <l n="258">And yet I bid thee , this night let thy bride</l>
     <l n="259">Apart among the womenfolk abide ;</l>
     <l n="260">That on the morrow thou with sacrifice</l>
     <l n="261">For these strange deeds may pay a fitting price . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="262">But as he spoke with something like to awe ,</l>
     <l n="263">His eyes and much-changed face Admetus saw ,</l>
     <l n="264">And voiceless like a slave his words obeyed ;</l>
     <l n="265">For rising up no more delay he made ,</l>
     <l n="266">But took the staff and gained the palace-door</l>
     <l n="267">Where stood the beasts , whose mingled whine and roar</l>
     <l n="268">Had wrought his dream ; there two and two they stood ,</l>
     <l n="269">Thinking , it might be , of the tangled wood ,</l>
     <l n="270">And all the joys of the food-hiding trees ,</l>
     <l n="271">But harmless as their painted images</l>
     <l n="272">‘ Neath some dread spell ; then , leaping up , he took</l>
     <l n="273">The reins in hand and the bossed leather shook ,</l>
     <l n="274">And no delay the conquered beasts durst make</l>
     <l n="275">But drew , not silent ; and folk just awake</l>
     <l n="276">When he went by , as though a god they saw ,</l>
     <l n="277">Fell on their knees , and maidens come to draw</l>
     <l n="278">Fresh water from the fount sank trembling down ,</l>
     <l n="279">And silence held the babbling wakened town .</l>
     <l n="280">So ‘ twixt the dewy hedges did he wend ,</l>
     <l n="281">And still their noise afar the beasts did send ,</l>
     <l n="282">His strange victorious advent to proclaim ,</l>
     <l n="283">Till to Iolchos at the last he came ,</l>
     <l n="284">And drew anigh the gates , whence in affright</l>
     <l n="285">The guards fled , helpless at the wondrous sight ;</l>
     <l n="286">And through the town news of the coming spread</l>
     <l n="287">Of some great god so that the scared priests led</l>
     <l n="288">Pale suppliants forth ; who , in unmeet attire</l>
     <l n="289">And hastily-caught boughs and smouldering fire</l>
     <l n="290">Within their censers , in the market-place</l>
     <l n="291">Awaited him with many an upturned face ,</l>
     <l n="292">Trembling with fear of that unnamed new god ;</l>
     <l n="293">But through the midst of them his lions trod</l>
     <l n="294">With noiseless feet , nor noted aught their prey ,</l>
     <l n="295">And the boars ’ hooves went pattering on the way ,</l>
     <l n="296">While from their churning tusks the white foam flew</l>
     <l n="297">As raging , helpless , in the trace they drew .</l>
     <l n="298">But Pelias , knowing all the work of fate ,</l>
     <l n="299">Sat in his brazen-pillared porch to wait</l>
     <l n="300">The coming of the King ; the while the maid</l>
     <l n="301">In her fair marriage garments was arrayed ,</l>
     <l n="302">And from strong places of his treasury</l>
     <l n="303">Men brought fine scarlet from the Syrian sea ,</l>
     <l n="304">And works of brass , and ivory , and gold ;</l>
     <l n="305">But when the strange yoked beasts he did behold</l>
     <l n="306">Come through the press of people terrified ,</l>
     <l n="307">Then he arose and o'er the clamour cried ,</l>
     <l n="308">“ Hail , thou , who like a very god art come</l>
     <l n="309">To bring great honour to my damsel 's home ; ”</l>
     <l n="310">And when Admetus tightened rein before</l>
     <l n="311">The gleaming , brazen-wrought , half-opened door .</l>
     <l n="312">He cried to Pelias , “ Hail , to thee , O King ;</l>
     <l n="313">Let me behold once more my father 's ring ,</l>
     <l n="314">Let me behold the prize that I have won ,</l>
     <l n="315">Mine eyes are wearying now to look upon . ”</l>
     <l n="316">“ Fear not , ” he said , “ the Fates are satisfied ;</l>
     <l n="317">Yet wilt thou not descend and here abide ,</l>
     <l n="318">Doing me honour till the next bright morn</l>
     <l n="319">Has dried the dew upon the new-sprung corn ,</l>
     <l n="320">That we in turn may give the honour due</l>
     <l n="321">To such a man that such a thing can do ,</l>
     <l n="322">And unto all the gods may sacrifice ? ”</l>
     <l n="323">“ Nay , ” said Admetus , “ if thou call'st me wise ,</l>
     <l n="324">And like a very god thou dost me deem ,</l>
     <l n="325">Shall I abide the ending of the dream</l>
     <l n="326">And so gain nothing ? nay , let me be glad</l>
     <l n="327">That I at least one godlike hour have had</l>
     <l n="328">At whatsoever time I come to die ,</l>
     <l n="329">That I may mock the world that passes by ,</l>
     <l n="330">And yet forgets it . ” Saying this , indeed ,</l>
     <l n="331">Of Pelias did he seem to take small heed ,</l>
     <l n="332">But spoke as one unto himself may speak ,</l>
     <l n="333">And still the half-shut door his eyes did seek ,</l>
     <l n="334">Wherethrough from distant rooms sweet music came ,</l>
     <l n="335">Setting his over-strainéd heart a-flame ,</l>
     <l n="336">Because amidst the Lydian flutes he thought</l>
     <l n="337">From place to place his love the maidens brought .</l>
     <l n="338">Then Pelias said , “ What can I give to thee</l>
     <l n="339">Who fail'st so little of divinity ?</l>
     <l n="340">Yet let my slaves lay these poor gifts within</l>
     <l n="341">Thy chariot , while my daughter strives to win</l>
     <l n="342">The favour of the spirits of this place ,</l>
     <l n="343">Since from their altars she must turn her face</l>
     <l n="344">For ever now ; hearken , her flutes I hear ,</l>
     <l n="345">From the last chapel doth she draw anear . ”</l>
     <l n="346">Then by Admetus ’ feet the folk ‘ gan pile</l>
     <l n="347">The precious things , but he no less the while</l>
     <l n="348">Stared at the door ajar , and thought it long</l>
     <l n="349">Ere with the flutes mingled the maidens ’ song ,</l>
     <l n="350">And both grew louder , and the scarce-seen floor</l>
     <l n="351">Was fluttering with white raiment , and the door</l>
     <l n="352">By slender fingers was set open wide ,</l>
     <l n="353">And midst her damsels he beheld the bride</l>
     <l n="354">Ungirt , with hair unbound and garlanded :</l>
     <l n="355">Then Pelias took her slender hand and said ,</l>
     <l n="356">“ Daughter , this is the man that takes from thee</l>
     <l n="357">Thy curse midst women , think no more to be</l>
     <l n="358">Childless , unloved , and knowing little bliss ;</l>
     <l n="359">But now behold how like a god he is ,</l>
     <l n="360">And yet with what prayers for the love of thee</l>
     <l n="361">He must have wearied some divinity ,</l>
     <l n="362">And therefore in thine inmost heart be glad</l>
     <l n="363">That thou ‘ mongst women such a man hast had . ”</l>
     <l n="364">Then she with wondering eyes that strange team saw</l>
     <l n="365">A moment , then as one with gathering awe</l>
     <l n="366">Might turn from Jove 's bird unto very Jove ,</l>
     <l n="367">So did she raise her grey eyes to her love ,</l>
     <l n="368">But to her brow the blood rose therewithal ,</l>
     <l n="369">And she must tremble , such a look did fall</l>
     <l n="370">Upon her faithful eyes , that none the less</l>
     <l n="371">Would falter aught , for all her shamefastness ,</l>
     <l n="372">But rather to her lover 's hungry eyes</l>
     <l n="373">Gave back a tender look of glad surprise ,</l>
     <l n="374">Wherein love 's flame began to flicker now .</l>
     <l n="375">Withal , her father kissed her on the brow ,</l>
     <l n="376">And said , “ O daughter , take this royal ring ,</l>
     <l n="377">And set it on the finger of the King ,</l>
     <l n="378">And come not back ; and thou , Admetus , pour</l>
     <l n="379">This wine to Jove before my open door ,</l>
     <l n="380">And glad at heart take back thine own with thee . ”</l>
     <l n="381">Then with that word Alcestis silently ,</l>
     <l n="382">And with no look cast back , and ring in hand ,</l>
     <l n="383">Went forth , and soon beside her love did stand ,</l>
     <l n="384">Nor on his finger failed to set the ring ;</l>
     <l n="385">And then a golden cup the city 's King</l>
     <l n="386">Gave to him , and he poured and said , “ O thou ,</l>
     <l n="387">From whatsoever place thou lookest now ,</l>
     <l n="388">What prayers , what gifts unto thee shall I give</l>
     <l n="389">That we a little time with love may live ?</l>
     <l n="390">A little time of love , then fall asleep</l>
     <l n="391">Together , while the crown of love we keep . ”</l>
     <l n="392">So spake he , and his strange beasts turned about ,</l>
     <l n="393">And heeded not the people 's wavering shout</l>
     <l n="394">That from their old fear and new pleasure sprung ,</l>
     <l n="395">Nor noted aught of what the damsels sung ,</l>
     <l n="396">Or of the flowers that after them they cast ,</l>
     <l n="397">But like a dream the guarded city passed ,</l>
     <l n="398">And ‘ twixt the song of birds and blossoms ’ scent</l>
     <l n="399">It seemed for many hundred years they went ,</l>
     <l n="400">Though short the way was unto Pheræ 's gates ;</l>
     <l n="401">Time they forgat , and gods , and men , and fates ,</l>
     <l n="402">However nigh unto their hearts they were ;</l>
     <l n="403">The woodland boars , the yellow lords of fear</l>
     <l n="404">No more seemed strange to them , but all the earth</l>
     <l n="405">With all its changing sorrow and wild mirth</l>
     <l n="406">In that fair hour seemed new-born to the twain ,</l>
     <l n="407">Grief seemed a play forgot , a pageant vain ,</l>
     <l n="408">A picture painted , who knows where or when ,</l>
     <l n="409">With soulless images of restless men ;</l>
     <l n="410">For every thought but love was now gone by ,</l>
     <l n="411">And they forgot that they should ever die .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="412">But when they came anigh the sacred wood ,</l>
     <l n="413">There , biding them , Admetus ’ herdsman stood ,</l>
     <l n="414">At sight of whom those yoke-fellows unchecked</l>
     <l n="415">Stopped dead and little of Admetus recked</l>
     <l n="416">Who now , as one from dreams not yet awake ,</l>
     <l n="417">Drew back his love and did his wain forsake ,</l>
     <l n="418">And gave the carven rod and guiding bands</l>
     <l n="419">Into the waiting herdsman 's outstretched hands ,</l>
     <l n="420">But when he would have thanked him for the thing</l>
     <l n="421">That he had done , his speechless tongue must cling</l>
     <l n="422">Unto his mouth , and why he could not tell .</l>
     <l n="423">But the man said , “ No words ! thou hast done well</l>
     <l n="424">To me , as I to thee ; the day may come</l>
     <l n="425">When thou shalt ask me for a fitting home ,</l>
     <l n="426">Nor shalt thou ask in vain ; but hasten now ,</l>
     <l n="427">And to thine house this royal maiden show ,</l>
     <l n="428">Then give her to thy women for this night .</l>
     <l n="429">But when thou wakest up to thy delight</l>
     <l n="430">To-morrow , do all things that should be done ,</l>
     <l n="431">Nor of the gods , forget thou any one ,</l>
     <l n="432">And on the next day will I come again</l>
     <l n="433">To tend thy flocks upon the grassy plain .</l>
     <l n="434">“ But now depart , and from thine home send here</l>
     <l n="435">Chariot and horse , these gifts of thine to bear</l>
     <l n="436">Unto thine house , and going , look not back</l>
     <l n="437">Lest many a wished-for thing thou com'st to lack . ”</l>
     <l n="438">Then hand in hand together , up the road</l>
     <l n="439">The lovers passed unto the King 's abode ,</l>
     <l n="440">And as they went , the whining snort and roar</l>
     <l n="441">From the yoked beasts they heard break out once more</l>
     <l n="442">And then die off , as they were led away ,</l>
     <l n="443">But whether to some place lit up by day ,</l>
     <l n="444">Or , ‘ neath the earth , they knew not , for the twain</l>
     <l n="445">Went hastening on , nor once looked back again .</l>
     <l n="446">But soon the minstrels met them , and a band</l>
     <l n="447">Of white-robed damsels flowery boughs in hand ,</l>
     <l n="448">To bid them welcome to that pleasant place .</l>
     <l n="449">Then they , rejoicing much , in no long space</l>
     <l n="450">Came to the brazen-pillared porch , whereon</l>
     <l n="451">From ‘ twixt the passes of the hills yet shone</l>
     <l n="452">The dying sun ; and there she stood awhile</l>
     <l n="453">Without the threshold , a faint tender smile</l>
     <l n="454">Trembling upon her lips ‘ twixt love and shame ,</l>
     <l n="455">Until each side of her a maiden came</l>
     <l n="456">And raised her in their arms , that her fair feet</l>
     <l n="457">The polished brazen threshold might not meet ,</l>
     <l n="458">And in Admetus ’ house she stood at last .</l>
     <l n="459">But to the women 's chamber straight she passed</l>
     <l n="460">Bepraised of all ,— and so the wakeful night</l>
     <l n="461">Lonely the lovers passed e'en as they might .</l>
     <l n="462">But the next day with many a sacrifice ,</l>
     <l n="463">Admetus wrought , for such a well-won prize ,</l>
     <l n="464">A life so blest , the gods to satisfy ,</l>
     <l n="465">And many a matchless beast that day did die</l>
     <l n="466">Upon the altars ; nought unlucky seemed</l>
     <l n="467">To be amid the joyous crowd that gleamed</l>
     <l n="468">With gold and precious things , and only this</l>
     <l n="469">Seemed wanting to the King of Pheræ 's bliss ,</l>
     <l n="470">That all these pageants should be soon past by ,</l>
     <l n="471">And hid by night the fair spring blossoms lie .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="472">Yet on the morrow-morn Admetus came ,</l>
     <l n="473">A haggard man oppressed with grief and shame</l>
     <l n="474">Unto the spot beside Boebeis ’ shore</l>
     <l n="475">Whereby he met his herdsman once before ,</l>
     <l n="476">And there again he found him flushed and glad ,</l>
     <l n="477">And from the babbling water newly clad ,</l>
     <l n="478">Then he with downcast eyes these words began ,</l>
     <l n="479">“ O thou , whatso thy name is , god or man ,</l>
     <l n="480">Hearken to me ; meseemeth of thy deed</l>
     <l n="481">Some dread immortal taketh angry heed .</l>
     <l n="482">“ Last night the height of my desire seemed won ,</l>
     <l n="483">All day my weary eyes had watched the sun</l>
     <l n="484">Rise up and sink , and now was come the night</l>
     <l n="485">When I should be alone with my delight ;</l>
     <l n="486">Silent the house was now from floor to roof ,</l>
     <l n="487">And in the well-hung chambers , far aloof ,</l>
     <l n="488">The feasters lay ; the moon was in the sky ,</l>
     <l n="489">The soft spring wind was wafting lovingly</l>
     <l n="490">Across the gardens fresh scents to my sweet ,</l>
     <l n="491">As , troubled with the sound of my own feet ,</l>
     <l n="492">I passed betwixt the pillars , whose long shade</l>
     <l n="493">Black on the white red-veinéd floor was laid :</l>
     <l n="494">So happy was I that the briar-rose ,</l>
     <l n="495">Rustling outside within the flowery close ,</l>
     <l n="496">Seemed but Love 's odorous wing — too real all seemed</l>
     <l n="497">For such a joy as I had never dreamed .</l>
     <l n="498">“ Why do I linger , as I lingered not</l>
     <l n="499">In that fair hour , now ne'er to be forgot</l>
     <l n="500">While my life lasts ?— Upon the gilded door</l>
     <l n="501">I laid my hand ; I stood upon the floor</l>
     <l n="502">Of the bride-chamber , and I saw the bride ,</l>
     <l n="503">Lovelier than any dream , stand by the side</l>
     <l n="504">Of the gold bed , with hands that hid her face :</l>
     <l n="505">One cry of joy I gave , and then the place</l>
     <l n="506">Seemed changed to hell as in a hideous dream .</l>
     <l n="507">“ Still did the painted silver pillars gleam</l>
     <l n="508">Betwixt the scented torches and the moon ;</l>
     <l n="509">Still did the garden shed its odorous boon</l>
     <l n="510">Upon the night ; still did the nightingale</l>
     <l n="511">Unto his brooding mate tell all his tale :</l>
     <l n="512">But , risen ‘ twixt my waiting love and me ,</l>
     <l n="513">As soundless as the dread eternity ,</l>
     <l n="514">Sprung up from nothing , could mine eyes behold</l>
     <l n="515">A huge dull-gleaming dreadful coil that rolled</l>
     <l n="516">In changing circles on the pavement fair .</l>
     <l n="517">Then for the sword that was no longer there</l>
     <l n="518">My hand sank to my side ; around I gazed ,</l>
     <l n="519">And ‘ twixt the coils I met her grey eyes , glazed</l>
     <l n="520">With sudden horror most unspeakable ;</l>
     <l n="521">And when mine own upon no weapon fell ,</l>
     <l n="522">For what should weapons do in such a place ,</l>
     <l n="523">Unto the dragon 's head I set my face ,</l>
     <l n="524">And raised bare hands against him , but a cry</l>
     <l n="525">Burst on mine ears of utmost agony</l>
     <l n="526">That nailed me there , and she cried out to me ,</l>
     <l n="527">‘ O get thee hence ; alas , I cannot flee !</l>
     <l n="528">They coil about me now , my lips to kiss .</l>

     <l n="530">“ Alas , my shame ! trembling , away I slunk ,</l>
     <l n="531">Yet turning saw the fearful coil had sunk</l>
     <l n="532">To whence it came , my love 's limbs freed I saw ,</l>
     <l n="533">And a long breath at first I heard her draw</l>
     <l n="534">As one redeemed , then heard the hard sobs come ,</l>
     <l n="535">And wailings for her new accurséd home .</l>
     <l n="536">But there outside across the door I lay ,</l>
     <l n="537">Like a scourged hound , until the dawn of day ;</l>
     <l n="538">And as her gentle breathing then I heard</l>
     <l n="539">As though she slept , before the earliest bird</l>
     <l n="540">Began his song , I wandered forth to seek</l>
     <l n="541">Thee , O strange man , e'en as thou seest me , weak</l>
     <l n="542">With all the torment of the night , and shamed</l>
     <l n="543">With such a shame as never shall be named</l>
     <l n="544">To aught but thee — Yea , yea , and why to thee</l>
     <l n="545">Perchance this ends all thou wilt do for me ?—</l>
     <l n="546">What then , and have I not a cure for that ?</l>
     <l n="547">Lo , yonder is a rock where I have sat</l>
     <l n="548">Full many an hour while yet my life was life ,</l>
     <l n="549">With hopes of all the coming wonder rife .</l>
     <l n="550">No sword hangs by my side , no god will turn</l>
     <l n="551">This cloudless hazy blue to black , and burn</l>
     <l n="552">My useless body with his lightning flash ;</l>
     <l n="553">But the white waves above my bones may wash ,</l>
     <l n="554">And when old chronicles our house shall name</l>
     <l n="555">They may leave out the letters and the shame ,</l>
     <l n="556">That make Admetus , once a king of men —</l>
     <l n="557">And how could I be worse or better then ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="558">As one who notes a curious instrument</l>
     <l n="559">Working against the maker 's own intent ,</l>
     <l n="560">The herdsman eyed his wan face silently ,</l>
     <l n="561">And smiling for a while , and then said he ,—</l>
     <l n="562">“ Admetus , thou , in spite of all I said ,</l>
     <l n="563">Hast drawn this evil thing upon thine head ,</l>
     <l n="564">Forgetting her who erewhile laid the curse</l>
     <l n="565">Upon the maiden , so for fear of worse</l>
     <l n="566">Go back again ; for fair-limbed Artemis</l>
     <l n="567">Now bars the sweet attainment of thy bliss ;</l>
     <l n="568">So taking heart , yet make no more delay</l>
     <l n="569">But worship her upon this very day ,</l>
     <l n="570">Nor spare for aught , and of thy trouble make</l>
     <l n="571">No semblance unto any for her sake ;</l>
     <l n="572">And thick upon the fair bride-chamber floor</l>
     <l n="573">Strew dittany , and on each side the door</l>
     <l n="574">Hang up such poppy-leaves as spring may yield ;</l>
     <l n="575">And for the rest , myself may be a shield</l>
     <l n="576">Against her wrath — nay , be thou not too bold</l>
     <l n="577">To ask me that which may not now be told .</l>
     <l n="578">Yea , even what thou deemest , hide it deep</l>
     <l n="579">Within thine heart , and let thy wonder sleep ,</l>
     <l n="580">For surely thou shalt one day know my name ,</l>
     <l n="581">When the time comes again that autumn 's flame</l>
     <l n="582">Is dying off the vine-boughs , overturned ,</l>
     <l n="583">Stripped of their wealth . But now let gifts be burned</l>
     <l n="584">To her I told thee of , and in three days</l>
     <l n="585">Shall I by many hard and rugged ways</l>
     <l n="586">Have come to thee again to bring thee peace .</l>
     <l n="587">Go , the sun rises and the shades decrease . ”</l>
     <l n="588">Then , thoughtfully , Admetus gat him back ,</l>
     <l n="589">Nor did the altars of the Huntress lack</l>
     <l n="590">The fattest of the flocks upon that day .</l>
     <l n="591">But when night came , in arms Admetus lay</l>
     <l n="592">Across the threshold of the bride-chamber ,</l>
     <l n="593">And nought amiss that night he noted there ,</l>
     <l n="594">But durst not enter , though about the door</l>
     <l n="595">Young poppy-leaves were twined , and on the floor ,</l>
     <l n="596">Not flowered as yet with downy leaves and grey ,</l>
     <l n="597">Fresh dittany beloved of wild goats lay .</l>
     <l n="598">But when the whole three days and nights were done ,</l>
     <l n="599">The herdsman came with rising of the sun ,</l>
     <l n="600">And said , “ Admetus , now rejoice again ,</l>
     <l n="601">Thy prayers and offerings have not been in vain ,</l>
     <l n="602">And thou at last mayst come unto thy bliss ;</l>
     <l n="603">And if thou askest for a sign of this ,</l>
     <l n="604">Take thou this token ; make good haste to rise ,</l>
     <l n="605">And get unto the garden-close that lies</l>
     <l n="606">Below these windows sweet with greenery ,</l>
     <l n="607">And in the midst a marvel shalt thou see ,</l>
     <l n="608">Three white , black-hearted poppies blossoming ,</l>
     <l n="609">Though this is but the middle of the spring . ”</l>
     <l n="610">Nor was it otherwise than he had said ,</l>
     <l n="611">And on that day with joy the twain were wed ,</l>
     <l n="612">And ‘ gan to lead a life of great delight ;</l>
     <l n="613">But the strange woeful history of that night ,</l>
     <l n="614">The monstrous car , the promise to the King ,</l>
     <l n="615">All these through weary hours of chiselling</l>
     <l n="616">Were wrought in stone , and in Diana 's wall</l>
     <l n="617">Set up , a joy and witness unto all .</l>
     <l n="618">But neither so would wingéd time abide ,</l>
     <l n="619">The changing year came round to autumn-tide ,</l>
     <l n="620">Until at last the day was fully come</l>
     <l n="621">When the strange guest first reached Admetus ’ home .</l>
     <l n="622">Then , when the sun was reddening to its end ,</l>
     <l n="623">He to Admetus ’ brazen porch did wend ,</l>
     <l n="624">Whom there he found feathering a poplar dart ,</l>
     <l n="625">Then said he , “ King , the time has come to part .</l>
     <l n="626">Come forth , for I have that to give thine ear</l>
     <l n="627">No man upon the earth but thou must hear . ”</l>
     <l n="628">Then rose the King , and with a troubled look</l>
     <l n="629">His well-steeled spear within his hand he took ,</l>
     <l n="630">And by his herdsman silently he went</l>
     <l n="631">As to a peakéd hill his steps he bent ,</l>
     <l n="632">Nor did the parting servant speak one word ,</l>
     <l n="633">As up they climbed , unto his silent lord ,</l>
     <l n="634">Till from the top he turned about his head</l>
     <l n="635">From all the glory of the gold light , shed</l>
     <l n="636">Upon the hill-top by the setting sun ,</l>
     <l n="637">For now indeed the day was well-nigh done ,</l>
     <l n="638">And all the eastern vale was grey and cold ;</l>
     <l n="639">But when Admetus he did now behold ,</l>
     <l n="640">Panting beside him from the steep ascent ,</l>
     <l n="641">One much-changed godlike look on him he bent .</l>
     <l n="642">And said , “ O mortal , listen , for I see</l>
     <l n="643">Thou deemest somewhat of what is in me ;</l>
     <l n="644">Fear not ! I love thee , even as I can</l>
     <l n="645">Who cannot feel the woes and ways of man</l>
     <l n="646">In spite of this my seeming , for indeed</l>
     <l n="647">Now thou beholdest Jove 's immortal seed ,</l>
     <l n="648">And what my name is I would tell thee now ,</l>
     <l n="649">If men who dwell upon the earth as thou</l>
     <l n="650">Could hear the name and live ; but on the earth .</l>
     <l n="651">With strange melodious stories of my birth ,</l>
     <l n="652">Phoebus men call me , and Latona 's son .</l>
     <l n="653">“ And now my servitude with thee is done ,</l>
     <l n="654">And I shall leave thee toiling on thine earth ,</l>
     <l n="655">This handful , that within its little girth</l>
     <l n="656">Holds that which moves you so , O men that die ;</l>
     <l n="657">Behold , to-day thou hast felicity ,</l>
     <l n="658">But the times change , and I can see a day</l>
     <l n="659">When all thine happiness shall fade away ;</l>
     <l n="660">And yet be merry , strive not with the end ,</l>
     <l n="661">Thou canst not change it ; for the rest , a friend</l>
     <l n="662">This year has won thee who shall never fail ;</l>
     <l n="663">But now indeed , for nought will it avail</l>
     <l n="664">To say what I may have in store for thee ,</l>
     <l n="665">Of gifts that men desire ; let these things be ,</l>
     <l n="666">And live thy life , till death itself shall come ,</l>
     <l n="667">And turn to nought the storehouse of thine home ,</l>
     <l n="668">Then think of me ; these feathered shafts behold ,</l>
     <l n="669">That here have been the terror of the wold ,</l>
     <l n="670">Take these , and count them still the best of all</l>
     <l n="671">Thine envied wealth , and when on thee shall fall</l>
     <l n="672">By any way the worst extremity ,</l>
     <l n="673">Call upon me before thou com'st to die ,</l>
     <l n="674">And lay these shafts with incense on a fire ,</l>
     <l n="675">That thou mayst gain thine uttermost desire . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="676">He ceased , but ere the golden tongue was still</l>
     <l n="677">An odorous mist had stolen up the hill ,</l>
     <l n="678">And to Admetus first the god grew dim ,</l>
     <l n="679">And then was but a lovely voice to him ,</l>
     <l n="680">And then at last the sun had sunk to rest ,</l>
     <l n="681">And a fresh wind blew lightly from the west</l>
     <l n="682">Over the hill-top , and no soul was there ;</l>
     <l n="683">But the sad dying autumn field-flowers fair ,</l>
     <l n="684">Rustled dry leaves about the windy place ,</l>
     <l n="685">Where even now had been the godlike face ,</l>
     <l n="686">And in their midst the brass-bound quiver lay .</l>
     <l n="687">Then , going further westward , far away ,</l>
     <l n="688">He saw the gleaming of Peneus wan</l>
     <l n="689">‘ Neath the white sky , but never any man ,</l>
     <l n="690">Except a grey-haired shepherd driving down</l>
     <l n="691">From off the long slopes to his fold-yard brown</l>
     <l n="692">His woolly sheep , with whom a maiden went ,</l>
     <l n="693">Singing for labour done and sweet content</l>
     <l n="694">Of coming rest ; with that he turned again ,</l>
     <l n="695">And took the shafts up , never sped in vain ,</l>
     <l n="696">And came unto his house most deep in thought</l>
     <l n="697">Of all the things the varied year had brought .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="698">Thenceforth in bliss and honour day by day</l>
     <l n="699">His measured span of sweet life wore away .</l>
     <l n="700">A happy man he was ; no vain desire</l>
     <l n="701">Of foolish fame had set his heart a-fire ;</l>
     <l n="702">No care he had the ancient bounds to change ,</l>
     <l n="703">Nor yet for him must idle soldiers range</l>
     <l n="704">From place to place about the burdened land ,</l>
     <l n="705">Or thick upon the ruined cornfields stand ;</l>
     <l n="706">For him no trumpets blessed the bitter war ,</l>
     <l n="707">Wherein the right and wrong so mingled are ,</l>
     <l n="708">That hardly can the man of single heart</l>
     <l n="709">Amid the sickening turmoil choose his part ;</l>
     <l n="710">For him sufficed the changes of the year ,</l>
     <l n="711">The god-sent terror was enough of fear</l>
     <l n="712">For him ; enough the battle with the earth ,</l>
     <l n="713">The autumn triumph over drought and dearth .</l>
     <l n="714">Better to him than wolf-moved battered shields ,</l>
     <l n="715">O'er poor dead corpses , seemed the stubble-fields</l>
     <l n="716">Danced down beneath the moon , until the night</l>
     <l n="717">Grew dreamy with a shadowy sweet delight ,</l>
     <l n="718">And with the high-risen moon came pensive thought ,</l>
     <l n="719">And men in love 's despite must grow distraught</l>
     <l n="720">And loiter in the dance , and maidens drop</l>
     <l n="721">Their gathered raiment , and the fifer stop</l>
     <l n="722">His dancing notes the pensive drone that chid ,</l>
     <l n="723">And as they wander to their dwellings , hid</l>
     <l n="724">By the black shadowed trees , faint melody ,</l>
     <l n="725">Mournful and sweet , their soft good-night must be .</l>
     <l n="726">Far better spoil the gathering vat bore in</l>
     <l n="727">Unto the pressing shed , than midst the din</l>
     <l n="728">Of falling houses in war 's waggon lies</l>
     <l n="729">Besmeared with redder stains than Tyrian dyes ;</l>
     <l n="730">Or when the temple of the sea-born one</l>
     <l n="731">With glittering crowns and gallant raiment shone ,</l>
     <l n="732">Fairer the maidens seemed by no chain bound ,</l>
     <l n="733">But such as amorous arms might cast around</l>
     <l n="734">Their lovely bodies , than the wretched band</l>
     <l n="735">Who midst the shipmen by the gangway stand ;</l>
     <l n="736">Each lonely in her speechless misery ,</l>
     <l n="737">And thinking of the worse time that shall be ,</l>
     <l n="738">When midst of folk who scarce can speak her name ,</l>
     <l n="739">She bears the uttermost of toil and shame .</l>
     <l n="740">Better to him seemed that victorious crown ,</l>
     <l n="741">That midst the reverent silence of the town</l>
     <l n="742">He oft would set upon some singer 's brow</l>
     <l n="743">Than was the conqueror 's diadem , blest now</l>
     <l n="744">By lying priests , soon , bent and bloody , hung</l>
     <l n="745">Within the thorn by linnets well besung ,</l>
     <l n="746">Who think but little of the corpse beneath ,</l>
     <l n="747">Though ancient lands have trembled at his breath .</l>
     <l n="748">But to this King — fair Ceres ’ gifts , the days</l>
     <l n="749">Whereon men sung in flushed Lyæus ’ praise</l>
     <l n="750">Tales of old time , the bloodless sacrifice</l>
     <l n="751">Unto the goddess of the downcast eyes</l>
     <l n="752">And soft persuading lips , the ringing lyre</l>
     <l n="753">Unto the bearer of the holy fire</l>
     <l n="754">Who once had been amongst them — things like these</l>
     <l n="755">Seemed meet to him men 's yearning to appease ,</l>

     <l n="784">While he dwelt nowhere ? either way indeed ,</l>
     <l n="785">Will be enough for most men 's daily need ,</l>

     <l n="790">For neither midst the sweetness of his life</l>

     <l n="793">Did all his life seem lost to him or vain ,</l>
     <l n="794">A wasteful jest of Jove , an empty dream ;</l>
     <l n="795">Rather before him did a vague hope gleam ,</l>
     <l n="796">That made him a great-hearted man and wise ,</l>
     <l n="797">Who saw the deeds of men with far-seeing eyes ,</l>

     <l n="1111">And scarce their own lives seemed to touch them more</l>
     <l n="1112">Than that dead Queen 's beside Boebéis ’ shore ;</l>
     <l n="1113">Bitter and sweet so mingled in them both ,</l>
     <l n="1114">Their lives and that old tale , they had been loth ,</l>
     <l n="1115">Perchance , to have them told another way .—</l>
     <l n="1116">So passed the sun from that fair summer day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="1117">June drew unto its end , the hot bright days</l>
     <l n="1118">Now gat from men as much of blame as praise ,</l>
     <l n="1119">As rainless still they passed , without a cloud ,</l>
     <l n="1120">And growing grey at last , the barley bowed</l>
     <l n="1121">Before the south-east wind . On such a day</l>
     <l n="1122">These folk amid the trellised roses lay ,</l>
     <l n="1123">And careless for a little while at least ,</l>
     <l n="1124">Crowned with the mingled blossoms held their feast :</l>
     <l n="1125">Nor did the garden lack for younger folk ,</l>
     <l n="1126">Who cared no more for burning summer 's yoke</l>
     <l n="1127">Than the sweet breezes of the April-tide ;</l>
     <l n="1128">But through the thick trees wandered far and wide</l>
     <l n="1129">From sun to shade , and shade to sun again ,</l>
     <l n="1130">Until they deemed the elders would be fain</l>
     <l n="1131">To hear the tale , and shadows longer grew :</l>
     <l n="1132">Then round about the grave old men they drew ,</l>
     <l n="1133">Both youths and maidens ; and beneath their feet</l>
     <l n="1134">The grass seemed greener , and the flowers more sweet</l>
     <l n="1135">Unto the elders , as they stood around .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="1136">So through the calm air soon arose the sound</l>
     <l n="1137">Of one old voice as now a Wanderer spoke .</l>
     <l n="1138">“ O friends , and ye , fair loving gentle folk ,</l>
     <l n="1139">Would I could better tell a tale to-day ;</l>
     <l n="1140">But hark to this , which while our good ship lay</l>
     <l n="1141">Within the Weser such a while agone ,</l>
     <l n="1142">A Fleming told me , as we sat alone</l>
     <l n="1143">One Sunday evening in the Rose-garland ,</l>
     <l n="1144">And all the other folk were gone a-land</l>
     <l n="1145">After their pleasure , like sea-faring men .</l>
     <l n="1146">Surely I deem it no great wonder then</l>
     <l n="1147">That I remember everything he said ,</l>
     <l n="1148">Since from that Sunday eve strange fortune led</l>
     <l n="1149">That keel and me on such a weary way —</l>
     <l n="1150">Well , at the least it serveth you to-day . ”</l>

    <head>THE LADY OF THE LAND .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>A certain man having landed on an island in the Greek Sea found there a beautiful damsel , whom he would fain have delivered from a strange and dreadful doom , but failing herein , he died soon afterwards .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">It happened once , some men of Italy</l>
     <l n="2">Midst the Greek Islands went a sea-roving ,</l>
     <l n="3">And much good fortune had they on the sea :</l>
     <l n="4">Of many a man they had the ransoming ,</l>
     <l n="5">And many a chain they gat , and goodly thing ;</l>
     <l n="6">And midst their voyage to an isle they came ,</l>
     <l n="7">Whereof my story keepeth not the name .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">Now though but little was there left to gain ,</l>
     <l n="9">Because the richer folk had gone away ,</l>
     <l n="10">Yet since by this of water they were fain</l>
     <l n="11">They came to anchor in a land-locked bay ,</l>
     <l n="12">Whence in a while some went ashore to play ,</l>
     <l n="13">Going but lightly armed in twos or threes ,</l>
     <l n="14">For midst that folk they feared no enemies .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">And of these fellows that thus went ashore ,</l>
     <l n="16">One was there who left all his friends behind ;</l>
     <l n="17">Who going inland ever more and more ,</l>
     <l n="18">And being left quite alone , at last did find</l>
     <l n="19">A lonely valley sheltered from the wind ,</l>
     <l n="20">Wherein , amidst an ancient cypress wood ,</l>
     <l n="21">A long-deserted ruined castle stood .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="22">The wood , once ordered in fair grove and glade ,</l>
     <l n="23">With gardens overlooked by terraces ,</l>
     <l n="24">And marble-pavéd pools for pleasure made ,</l>
     <l n="25">Was tangled now , and choked with fallen trees ;</l>
     <l n="26">And he who went there , with but little ease</l>
     <l n="27">Must stumble by the stream 's side , once made meet</l>
     <l n="28">For tender women 's dainty wandering feet .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="29">The raven 's croak , the low wind choked and drear ,</l>
     <l n="30">The baffled stream , the grey wolf 's doleful cry ,</l>
     <l n="31">Were all the sounds that mariner could hear ,</l>
     <l n="32">As through the wood he wandered painfully ;</l>
     <l n="33">But as unto the house he drew anigh ,</l>
     <l n="34">The pillars of a ruined shrine he saw ,</l>
     <l n="35">The once fair temple of a fallen law .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="36">No image was there left behind to tell</l>
     <l n="37">Before whose face the knees of men had bowed ;</l>
     <l n="38">An altar of black stone , of old wrought well ,</l>
     <l n="39">Alone beneath a ruined roof now showed</l>
     <l n="40">The goal whereto the folk were wont to crowd ,</l>
     <l n="41">Seeking for things forgotten long ago ,</l>
     <l n="42">Praying for heads long ages laid a-low .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="43">Close to the temple was the castle-gate ,</l>
     <l n="44">Doorless and crumbling ; there our fellow turned ,</l>
     <l n="45">Trembling indeed at what might chance to wait</l>
     <l n="46">The prey entrapped , yet with a heart that burned</l>
     <l n="47">To know the most of what might there be learned ,</l>
     <l n="48">And hoping somewhat too , amid his fear ,</l>
     <l n="49">To light on such things as all men hold dear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="50">Noble the house was , nor seemed built for war ,</l>
     <l n="51">But rather like the work of other days ,</l>
     <l n="52">When men , in better peace than now they are ,</l>
     <l n="53">Had leisure on the world around to gaze ,</l>
     <l n="54">And noted well the past times ’ changing ways ;</l>
     <l n="55">And fair with sculptured stories it was wrought ,</l>
     <l n="56">By lapse of time unto dim ruin brought .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="57">Now as he looked about on all these things ,</l>
     <l n="58">And strove to read the mouldering histories ,</l>
     <l n="59">Above the door an image with wide wings ,</l>
     <l n="60">Whose unclad limbs a serpent seemed to seize ,</l>
     <l n="61">He dimly saw , although the western breeze ,</l>
     <l n="62">And years of biting frost and washing rain ,</l>
     <l n="63">Had made the carver 's labour well-nigh vain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="64">But this , though perished sore , and worn away ,</l>
     <l n="65">He noted well , because it seemed to be ,</l>
     <l n="66">After the fashion of another day ,</l>
     <l n="67">Some great man 's badge of war , or armoury ,</l>
     <l n="68">And round it a carved wreath he seemed to see ;</l>
     <l n="69">But taking note of these things , at the last</l>
     <l n="70">The mariner beneath the gateway passed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="71">And there a lovely cloistered court he found ,</l>
     <l n="72">A fountain in the midst o'erthrown and dry ,</l>
     <l n="73">And in the cloister briers twining round</l>
     <l n="74">The slender shafts ; the wondrous imagery</l>
     <l n="75">Outworn by more than many years gone by ,</l>
     <l n="76">Because the country people , in their fear</l>
     <l n="77">Of wizardry , had wrought destruction here ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="78">And piteously these fair things had been maimed ;</l>
     <l n="79">There stood great Jove , lacking his head of might ;</l>
     <l n="80">Here was the archer , swift Apollo , lamed ;</l>
     <l n="81">The shapely limbs of Venus hid from sight</l>
     <l n="82">By weeds and shards ; Diana 's ankles light</l>
     <l n="83">Bound with the cable of some coasting ship ;</l>
     <l n="84">And rusty nails through Helen 's maddening lip .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="85">Therefrom unto the chambers did he pass ,</l>
     <l n="86">And found them fair still , midst of their decay ,</l>
     <l n="87">Though in them now no sign of man there was ,</l>
     <l n="88">And everything but stone had passed away</l>
     <l n="89">That made them lovely in that vanished day ;</l>
     <l n="90">Nay , the mere walls themselves would soon be gone</l>
     <l n="91">And nought be left but heaps of mouldering stone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="92">But he , when all the place he had gone o'er .</l>
     <l n="93">And with much trouble clomb the broken stair ,</l>
     <l n="94">And from the topmost turret seen the shore</l>
     <l n="95">And his good ship drawn up at anchor there ,</l>
     <l n="96">Came down again , and found a crypt most fair</l>
     <l n="97">Built wonderfully beneath the greatest hall ,</l>
     <l n="98">And there he saw a door within the wall ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="99">Well-hinged , close shut ; nor was there in that place</l>
     <l n="100">Another on its hinges , therefore he</l>
     <l n="101">Stood there and pondered for a little space ,</l>
     <l n="102">And thought , “ Perchance some marvel I shall see ,</l>
     <l n="103">For surely here some dweller there must be ,</l>
     <l n="104">Because this door seems whole , and new , and sound .</l>
     <l n="105">While nought but ruin I can see around . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="106">So with that word , moved by a strong desire ,</l>
     <l n="107">He tried the hasp , that yielded to his hand ,</l>
     <l n="108">And in a strange place , lit as by a fire</l>
     <l n="109">Unseen but near , he presently did stand ;</l>
     <l n="110">And by an odorous breeze his face was fanned ,</l>
     <l n="111">As though in some Arabian plain he stood ,</l>
     <l n="112">Anigh the border of a spice-tree wood .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="113">He moved not for awhile , but looking round ,</l>
     <l n="114">He wondered much to see the place so fair ,</l>
     <l n="115">Because , unlike the castle above ground ,</l>
     <l n="116">No pillager or wrecker had been there ;</l>
     <l n="117">It seemed that time had passed on otherwhere ,</l>
     <l n="118">Nor laid a finger on this hidden place ,</l>
     <l n="119">Rich with the wealth of some forgotten race .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="120">With hangings , fresh as when they left the loom ,</l>
     <l n="121">The walls were hung a space above the head ,</l>
     <l n="122">Slim ivory chairs were set about the room ,</l>
     <l n="123">And in one corner was a dainty bed ,</l>
     <l n="124">That seemed for some fair queen apparelléd ;</l>
     <l n="125">And marble was the worst stone of the floor ,</l>
     <l n="126">That with rich Indian webs was covered o'er .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="127">The wanderer trembled when he saw all this ,</l>
     <l n="128">Because he deemed by magic it was wrought ;</l>
     <l n="129">Yet in his heart a longing for some bliss ,</l>
     <l n="130">Whereof the hard and changing world knows nought ,</l>
     <l n="131">Arose and urged him on , and dimmed the thought</l>
     <l n="132">That there perchance some devil lurked to slay</l>
     <l n="133">The heedless wanderer from the light of day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="134">Over against him was another door</l>
     <l n="135">Set in the wall , so , casting fear aside ,</l>
     <l n="136">With hurried steps he crossed the varied floor ,</l>
     <l n="137">And there again the silver latch he tried</l>
     <l n="138">And with no pain the door he opened wide ,</l>
     <l n="139">And entering the new chamber cautiously</l>
     <l n="140">The glory of great heaps of gold could see .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="141">Upon the floor uncounted medals lay ,</l>
     <l n="142">Like things of little value ; here and there</l>
     <l n="143">Stood golden caldrons , that might well outweigh</l>
     <l n="144">The biggest midst an emperor 's copper-ware ,</l>
     <l n="145">And golden cups were set on tables fair ,</l>
     <l n="146">Themselves of gold ; and in all hollow things</l>
     <l n="147">Were stored great gems , worthy the crowns of kings .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="148">The walls and roof with gold were overlaid ,</l>
     <l n="149">And precious raiment from the wall hung down ;</l>
     <l n="150">The fall of kings that treasure might have stayed ,</l>
     <l n="151">Or gained some longing conqueror great renown ,</l>
     <l n="152">Or built again some god-destroyed old town ;</l>
     <l n="153">What wonder , if this plunderer of the sea</l>
     <l n="154">Stood gazing at it long and dizzily ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="155">But at the last his troubled eyes and dazed</l>
     <l n="156">He lifted from the glory of that gold ,</l>
     <l n="157">And then the image , that well-nigh erased</l>
     <l n="158">Over the castle-gate he did behold ,</l>
     <l n="159">Above a door well wrought in coloured gold</l>
     <l n="160">Again he saw ; a naked girl with wings</l>
     <l n="161">Enfolded in a serpent 's scaly rings .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="162">And even as his eyes were fixed on it</l>
     <l n="163">A woman 's voice came from the other side ,</l>
     <l n="164">And through his heart strange hopes began to flit</l>
     <l n="165">That in some wondrous land he might abide</l>
     <l n="166">Not dying , master of a deathless bride ,</l>
     <l n="167">So o'er the gold which now he scarce could see</l>
     <l n="168">He went , and passed this last door eagerly .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="169">Then in a room he stood wherein there was</l>
     <l n="170">A marble bath , whose brimming water yet</l>
     <l n="171">Was scarcely still ; a vessel of green glass</l>
     <l n="172">Half full of odorous ointment was there set</l>
     <l n="173">Upon the topmost step that still was wet ,</l>
     <l n="174">And jewelled shoes and women 's dainty gear ,</l>
     <l n="175">Lay cast upon the varied pavement near .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="176">In one quick glance these things his eyes did see ,</l>
     <l n="177">But speedily they turned round to behold</l>
     <l n="178">Another sight , for throned on ivory</l>
     <l n="179">There sat a woman , whose wet tresses rolled</l>
     <l n="180">On to the floor in waves of gleaming gold ,</l>
     <l n="181">Cast back from such a form as , erewhile shown</l>
     <l n="182">To one poor shepherd , lighted up Troy town .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="183">Naked she was , the kisses of her feet</l>
     <l n="184">Upon the floor a dying path had made</l>
     <l n="185">From the full bath unto her ivory seat ;</l>
     <l n="186">In her right hand , upon her bosom laid ,</l>
     <l n="187">She held a golden comb , a mirror weighed</l>
     <l n="188">Her left hand down , aback her fair head lay</l>
     <l n="189">Dreaming awake of some long vanished day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="190">Her eyes were shut , but she seemed not to sleep ,</l>
     <l n="191">Her lips were murmuring things unheard and low ,</l>
     <l n="192">Or sometimes twitched as though she needs must weep</l>
     <l n="193">Though from her eyes the tears refused to flow ,</l>
     <l n="194">And oft with heavenly red her cheek did glow ,</l>
     <l n="195">As if remembrance of some half-sweet shame</l>
     <l n="196">Across the web of many memories came .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="197">There stood the man , scarce daring to draw breath</l>
     <l n="198">For fear the lovely sight should fade away ;</l>
     <l n="199">Forgetting heaven , forgetting life and death ,</l>
     <l n="200">Trembling for fear lest something he should say</l>
     <l n="201">Unwitting , lest some sob should yet betray</l>
     <l n="202">His presence there , for to his eager eyes</l>
     <l n="203">Already did the tears begin to rise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="204">But as he gazed she moved , and with a sigh</l>
     <l n="205">Bent forward , dropping down her golden head ;</l>
     <l n="206">“ Alas , alas ! another day gone by ,</l>
     <l n="207">Another day and no soul come , ” she said ;</l>
     <l n="208">“ Another year , and still I am not dead ! ”</l>
     <l n="209">And with that word once more her head she raised ,</l>
     <l n="210">And on the trembling man with great eyes gazed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="211">Then he imploring hands to her did reach ,</l>
     <l n="212">And toward her very slowly ‘ gan to move</l>
     <l n="213">And with wet eyes her pity did beseech ,</l>
     <l n="214">And seeing her about to speak he strove</l>
     <l n="215">From trembling lips to utter words of love ;</l>
     <l n="216">But with a look she stayed his doubtful feet ,</l>
     <l n="217">And made sweet music as their eyes did meet .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="218">For now she spoke in gentle voice and clear ,</l>
     <l n="219">Using the Greek tongue that he knew full well ;</l>
     <l n="220">“ What man art thou , that thus hast wandered here .</l>
     <l n="221">And found this lonely chamber where I dwell ?</l>
     <l n="222">Beware , beware ! for I have many a spell ;</l>
     <l n="223">If greed of power and gold have led thee on ,</l>
     <l n="224">Not lightly shall this untold wealth be won .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="33">
     <l n="225">“ But if thou com'st here , knowing of my tale ,</l>
     <l n="226">In hope to bear away my body fair ,</l>
     <l n="227">Stout must thine heart be , nor shall that avail</l>
     <l n="228">If thou a wicked soul in thee dost bear ;</l>
     <l n="229">So once again I bid thee to beware ,</l>
     <l n="230">Because no base man things like this may see ,</l>

    <head>THE SON OF CROESUS .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Croesus , King of Lydia , dreamed that he saw his son slain by an iron weapon , and though by every means he strove to avert this doom from him , yet thus it happened , for his son was slain by the hand of the man who seemed least of all likely to do the deed .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Of Croesus tells my tale , a king of old</l>
     <l n="2">In Lydia , ere the Mede fell on the land ,</l>
     <l n="3">A man made mighty by great heaps of gold ,</l>
     <l n="4">Feared for the myriads strong of heart and hand</l>
     <l n="5">That ‘ neath his banners wrought out his command ,</l>
     <l n="6">And though his latter ending happed on ill ,</l>
     <l n="7">Yet first of every joy he had his fill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">Two sons he had , and one was dumb from birth ;</l>
     <l n="9">The other one , that Atys had to name ,</l>
     <l n="10">Grew up a fair youth , and of might and worth ,</l>
     <l n="11">And well it seemed the race wherefrom he came</l>
     <l n="12">From him should never get reproach or shame :</l>
     <l n="13">But yet no stroke he struck before his death ,</l>
     <l n="14">In no war-shout he spent his latest breath .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">Now Croesus , lying on his bed anight</l>
     <l n="16">Dreamed that he saw this dear son laid a-low ,</l>
     <l n="17">And folk lamenting he was slain outright ,</l>
     <l n="18">And that some iron thing had dealt the blow ;</l>
     <l n="19">By whose hand guided he could nowise know ,</l>
     <l n="20">Or if in peace by traitors it were done ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="22">Three times one night this vision broke his sleep ,</l>

     <l n="25">The threatened danger from so dear a head ;</l>
     <l n="26">And , since he now was old enough to wed ,</l>
     <l n="27">The King sent men to search the lands around ,</l>

     <l n="32">With blood of men , and many a deep green sea</l>
     <l n="33">Been reddened therewithal , and yet shall be ;</l>
     <l n="34">That her sweet voice might drown the people 's praise ,</l>

     <l n="39">And ancient dames , scanning her limb by limb ,</l>
     <l n="40">Had said that she was fair enough for him ,</l>

     <l n="46">Anigh him , and the Lydian men afar</l>

    <head>THE WATCHING OF THE FALCON .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>The case of this falcon was such , that whoso watched it without sleeping for seven days and seven nights , had his first wish granted him by a fay lady , that appeared to him thereon ; and some wished one thing , and some another . But a certain king , who watched the falcon daily , would wish for nought but the love of that fay ; which wish being accomplished , was afterwards his ruin .</head>

     <l n="1">Across the sea a land there is ,</l>
     <l n="2">Where , if fate will , may men have bliss ,</l>
     <l n="3">For it is fair as any land :</l>
     <l n="4">There hath the reaper a full hand ,</l>
     <l n="5">While in the orchard hangs aloft</l>
     <l n="6">The purple fig , a-growing soft ;</l>
     <l n="7">And fair the trellised vine-bunches</l>
     <l n="8">Are swung across the high elm-trees ;</l>
     <l n="9">And in the rivers great fish play ,</l>
     <l n="10">While over them pass day by day</l>
     <l n="11">The laden barges to their place .</l>
     <l n="12">There maids are straight , and fair of face ,</l>
     <l n="13">And men are stout for husbandry ,</l>
     <l n="14">And all is well as it can be</l>
     <l n="15">Upon this earth where all has end .</l>
     <l n="16">For on them God is pleased to send</l>
     <l n="17">The gift of Death down from above .</l>

     <l n="27">They pass their lives , and die at last</l>
     <l n="28">Unwilling , though their lot be cast</l>
     <l n="29">In wretched places of the earth ,</l>
     <l n="30">Where men have little joy from birth</l>
     <l n="31">Until they die ; in no such case</l>
     <l n="32">Were those who tilled this pleasant place .</l>
     <l n="33">There soothly men were loth to die ,</l>

     <l n="38">So folk within that country fair</l>
     <l n="39">Lived on , nor from their memories drave</l>
     <l n="40">The thought of what they could not have .</l>
     <l n="41">And without need tormented still</l>
     <l n="42">Each other with some bitter ill ;</l>
     <l n="43">Yea , and themselves too , growing grey</l>
     <l n="44">With dread of some long-lingering day ,</l>
     <l n="45">That never came ere they were dead</l>
     <l n="46">With green sods growing on the head ;</l>
     <l n="47">Nowise content with what they had ,</l>
     <l n="48">But falling still from good to bad</l>
     <l n="49">While hard they sought the hopeless best</l>
     <l n="50">And seldom happy or at rest</l>
     <l n="51">Until at last with lessening blood</l>

     <l n="59">Through the dark hills , but seldom trod .</l>
     <l n="60">Rarely did horse-hoof press the sod</l>
     <l n="61">About the quiet weedy moat ,</l>
     <l n="62">Where unscared did the great fish float ;</l>
     <l n="63">Because men dreaded there to see</l>
     <l n="64">The uncouth things of faërie ;</l>

     <l n="70">Hangings of gold and red and blue ,</l>
     <l n="71">And tables with fair service set ;</l>
     <l n="72">Cups that had paid the Cæsar 's debt</l>
     <l n="73">Could he have laid his hands on them ;</l>
     <l n="74">Dorsars , with pearls in every hem ,</l>
     <l n="75">And fair embroidered gold-wrought things ,</l>
     <l n="76">Fit for a company of kings ;</l>
     <l n="77">And in the chambers dainty beds ,</l>
     <l n="78">With pillows dight for fair young heads ;</l>
     <l n="79">And horses in the stables were ,</l>
     <l n="80">And in the cellars wine full clear</l>
     <l n="81">And strong , and casks of ale and mead ;</l>
     <l n="82">Yea , all things a great lord could need .</l>
     <l n="83">For whom these things were ready there</l>
     <l n="84">None knew ; but if one chanced to fare</l>
     <l n="85">Into that place at Easter-tide ,</l>
     <l n="86">There would he find a falcon tied</l>
     <l n="87">Unto a pillar of the Hall ;</l>
     <l n="88">And such a fate to him would fall ,</l>
     <l n="89">That if unto the seventh night ,</l>
     <l n="90">He watched the bird from dark to light ,</l>
     <l n="91">And light to dark unceasingly ,</l>
     <l n="92">On the last evening he should see</l>
     <l n="93">A lady beautiful past words ;</l>
     <l n="94">Then , were he come of clowns or lords ,</l>
     <l n="95">Son of a swineherd or a king ,</l>
     <l n="96">There must she grant him anything</l>
     <l n="97">Perforce , that he might dare to ask ,</l>
     <l n="98">And do his very hardest task</l>
     <l n="99">But if he slumbered , ne'er again</l>
     <l n="100">The wretch would wake for he was slain</l>
     <l n="101">Helpless , by hands he could not see ,</l>

     <l n="110">Or asked some toy for all their pay ,</l>
     <l n="111">That easily they might have won ,</l>
     <l n="112">Nor staked their lives and souls thereon ;</l>
     <l n="113">Or asking , asked for some great thing</l>
     <l n="114">That was their bane ; as to be king</l>
     <l n="115">One asked , and died the morrow morn</l>
     <l n="116">That he was crowned , of all forlorn .</l>
     <l n="117">Yet thither came a certain man ,</l>

     <l n="130">For by a losel was he slain ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="133">Such tales as these the fathers old</l>

     <l n="138">For ever on the earth to live ,</l>
     <l n="139">Nought could he ask that he had not :</l>

     <l n="141">Fair children , and a faithful wife ;</l>
     <l n="142">And happily had passed his life ,</l>
     <l n="143">And all fulfilled of victory ,</l>
     <l n="144">Yet was he fain this thing to see .</l>
     <l n="145">So towards the mountains he set out</l>
     <l n="146">One noontide , with a gallant rout</l>
     <l n="147">Of knights and lords , and as the day</l>
     <l n="148">Began to fail came to the way</l>
     <l n="149">Where he must enter all alone ,</l>
     <l n="150">Between the dreary walls of stone .</l>
     <l n="151">Thereon to that fair company</l>
     <l n="152">He bade farewell , who wistfully</l>
     <l n="153">Looked backward oft as home they rode ,</l>
     <l n="154">But in the entry he abode</l>
     <l n="155">Of that rough unknown narrowing pass ,</l>
     <l n="156">Where twilight at the high noon was .</l>
     <l n="157">Then onward he began to ride :</l>
     <l n="158">Smooth rose the rocks on every side ,</l>
     <l n="159">And seemed as they were cut by man ;</l>
     <l n="160">Adown them ever water ran ,</l>
     <l n="161">But they of living things were bare ,</l>
     <l n="162">Yea , not a blade of grass grew there ;</l>
     <l n="163">And underfoot rough was the way ,</l>
     <l n="164">For scattered all about there lay</l>
     <l n="165">Great jagged pieces of black stone .</l>
     <l n="166">Throughout the pass the wind did moan ,</l>
     <l n="167">With such wild noises , that the King</l>
     <l n="168">Could almost think he heard something</l>
     <l n="169">Spoken of men ; as one might hear</l>
     <l n="170">The voices of folk standing near</l>
     <l n="171">One 's chamber wall : yet saw he nought</l>
     <l n="172">Except those high walls strangely wrought ,</l>
     <l n="173">And overhead the strip of sky .</l>
     <l n="174">So , going onward painfully ,</l>
     <l n="175">He met therein no evil thing ,</l>
     <l n="176">But came about the sun-setting</l>
     <l n="177">Unto the opening of the pass ,</l>
     <l n="178">And thence beheld a vale of grass</l>
     <l n="179">Bright with the yellow daffodil ;</l>
     <l n="180">And all the vale the sun did fill</l>
     <l n="181">With his last glory . Midmost there</l>
     <l n="182">Rose up a stronghold , built four-square ,</l>
     <l n="183">Upon a flowery grassy mound ,</l>
     <l n="184">That moat and high wall ran around .</l>
     <l n="185">Thereby he saw a walled pleasance ,</l>
     <l n="186">With walks and sward fit for the dance</l>
     <l n="187">Of Arthur 's court in its best time ,</l>
     <l n="188">That seemed to feel some magic clime ;</l>
     <l n="189">For though through all the vale outside</l>
     <l n="190">Things were as in the April-tide ,</l>
     <l n="191">And daffodils and cowslips grew</l>
     <l n="192">And hidden the March violets blew ,</l>
     <l n="193">Within the bounds of that sweet close</l>
     <l n="194">Was trellised the bewildering rose ;</l>
     <l n="195">There was the lily over-sweet ,</l>
     <l n="196">And starry pinks for garlands meet ;</l>
     <l n="197">And apricots hung on the wall</l>
     <l n="198">And midst the flowers did peaches fall ,</l>
     <l n="199">And nought had blemish there or spot .</l>

     <l n="209">But not before that he could see</l>
     <l n="210">The drawbridge rise up silently .</l>
     <l n="211">Then round he gazed oppressed with awe ,</l>
     <l n="212">And there no living thing he saw</l>
     <l n="213">Except the sparrows in the eaves ,</l>
     <l n="214">As restless as light autumn leaves</l>
     <l n="215">Blown by the fitful rainy wind .</l>
     <l n="216">Thereon his final goal to find ,</l>
     <l n="217">He lighted off his war-horse good</l>
     <l n="218">And let him wander as he would ,</l>
     <l n="219">When he had eased him of his gear ;</l>
     <l n="220">Then gathering heart against his fear .</l>
     <l n="221">Just at the silent end of day</l>
     <l n="222">Through the fair porch he took his way</l>
     <l n="223">And found at last a goodly hall</l>
     <l n="224">With glorious hangings on the wall ,</l>
     <l n="225">Inwrought with trees of every clime ,</l>
     <l n="226">And stories of the ancient time ,</l>
     <l n="227">But all of sorcery they were .</l>
     <l n="228">For o'er the daïs Venus fair ,</l>
     <l n="229">Fluttered about by many a dove ,</l>
     <l n="230">Made hopeless men for hopeless love ,</l>
     <l n="231">Both sick and sorry ; there they stood</l>
     <l n="232">Wrought wonderfully in various mood ,</l>
     <l n="233">But wasted all by that hid fire</l>
     <l n="234">Of measureless o'erhYpppHeNsweet desire ,</l>
     <l n="235">And let the hurrying world go by</l>
     <l n="236">Forgetting all felicity .</l>
     <l n="237">But down the hall the tale was wrought</l>
     <l n="238">How Argo in old time was brought</l>
     <l n="239">To Colchis for the fleece of gold .</l>
     <l n="240">And on the other side was told</l>
     <l n="241">How mariners for long years came</l>
     <l n="242">To Circe , winning grief and shame .</l>
     <l n="243">Until at last by hardihead</l>
     <l n="244">And craft , Ulysses won her bed .</l>
     <l n="245">Long upon these the King did look</l>
     <l n="246">And of them all good heed he took ;</l>
     <l n="247">To see if they would tell him aught</l>
     <l n="248">About the matter that he sought ,</l>
     <l n="249">But all were of the times long past ;</l>
     <l n="250">So going all about , at last</l>
     <l n="251">When grown nigh weary of his search</l>
     <l n="252">A falcon on a silver perch ,</l>
     <l n="253">Anigh the daïs did he see ,</l>
     <l n="254">And wondered , because certainly</l>
     <l n="255">At his first coming ‘ twas not there ;</l>
     <l n="256">But ‘ neath the bird a scroll most fair ,</l>
     <l n="257">With golden letters on the white</l>
     <l n="258">He saw , and in the dim twilight</l>
     <l n="259">By diligence could he read this :—</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="260">“ Ye who have not enow of bliss ,</l>

     <l n="272">A little while did he abide ,</l>
     <l n="273">When he had read this , deep in thought ,</l>

     <l n="275">He had not got , that a wise man</l>
     <l n="276">Would wish ; yet in his mind it ran</l>
     <l n="277">That he might win a boundless realm ,</l>
     <l n="278">Yea , come to wear upon his helm</l>
     <l n="279">The crown of the whole conquered earth ;</l>
     <l n="280">That all who lived thereon , from birth</l>
     <l n="281">To death should call him King and Lord ,</l>
     <l n="282">And great kings tremble at his word ,</l>
     <l n="283">Until in turn he came to die .</l>
     <l n="284">Therewith a little did he sigh ,</l>
     <l n="285">But thought , “ Of Alexander yet</l>

     <l n="287">My name , if this should come to be ,</l>
     <l n="288">Whoever should come after me :</l>
     <l n="289">But while I lay wrapped round with gold</l>
     <l n="290">Should tales and histories manifold</l>
     <l n="291">Be written of me , false and true ;</l>
     <l n="292">And as the time still onward drew</l>
     <l n="293">Almost a god would folk count me ,</l>
     <l n="294">Saying , ‘ In our time none such be . ’ ”</l>

     <l n="296">And said , “ Ah , vain , and worse than vain !</l>

     <l n="298">Yet by that time should I be brought</l>
     <l n="299">Where all the world I should forget ,</l>
     <l n="300">And bitterly should I regret</l>
     <l n="301">That I , from godlike great renown ,</l>
     <l n="302">To helpless death must fall adown :</l>
     <l n="303">How could I bear to leave it all ? ”</l>
     <l n="304">Then straight upon his mind did fall</l>
     <l n="305">Thoughts of old longings half forgot ,</l>
     <l n="306">Matters for which his heart was hot</l>
     <l n="307">A while ago : whereof no more</l>
     <l n="308">He cared for some , and some right sore</l>
     <l n="309">Had vexed him , being fulfilled at last .</l>
     <l n="310">And when the thought of these had passed</l>
     <l n="311">Still something was there left behind ,</l>
     <l n="312">That by no torturing of his mind</l>
     <l n="313">Could he in any language name ,</l>

     <l n="322">Now , therewithal , was come the night</l>

     <l n="325">Waking , he paced about the hall ,</l>

     <l n="327">Fade into nought , and then grow white</l>
     <l n="328">In patches by the pale moonlight ,</l>
     <l n="329">And then again fade utterly</l>
     <l n="330">As still the moonbeams passed them by ;</l>
     <l n="331">Then in a while , with hope of day ,</l>
     <l n="332">Begin a little to grow grey ,</l>
     <l n="333">Until familiar things they grew ,</l>
     <l n="334">As up at last the great sun drew ,</l>
     <l n="335">And lit them with his yellow light</l>
     <l n="336">At ending of another night</l>
     <l n="337">Then right glad was he of the day ,</l>
     <l n="338">That passed with him in such-like way ;</l>
     <l n="339">For neither man nor beast came near ,</l>
     <l n="340">Nor any voices did he hear .</l>
     <l n="341">And when again it drew to night</l>
     <l n="342">Silent it passed , till first twilight</l>
     <l n="343">Of morning came , and then he heard</l>
     <l n="344">The feeble twittering of some bird ,</l>
     <l n="345">That , in that utter silence drear ,</l>
     <l n="346">Smote harsh and startling on his ear .</l>
     <l n="347">Therewith came on that lonely day</l>
     <l n="348">That passed him in no other way ;</l>
     <l n="349">And thus six days and nights went by</l>
     <l n="350">And nothing strange had come anigh .</l>
     <l n="351">And on that day he well-nigh deemed</l>
     <l n="352">That all that story had been dreamed .</l>
     <l n="353">Daylight and dark , and night and day ,</l>
     <l n="354">Passed ever in their wonted way ;</l>
     <l n="355">The wind played in the trees outside ,</l>
     <l n="356">The rooks from out the high trees cried ;</l>
     <l n="357">And all seemed natural , frank , and fair ,</l>
     <l n="358">With little signs of magic there .</l>
     <l n="359">Yet neither could he quite forget</l>
     <l n="360">That close with summer blossoms set ,</l>
     <l n="361">And fruit hung on trees blossoming ,</l>
     <l n="362">When all about was early spring .</l>
     <l n="363">Yea , if all this by man were made ,</l>
     <l n="364">Strange was it that yet undecayed</l>
     <l n="365">The food lay on the tables still</l>
     <l n="366">Unchanged by man , that wine did fill</l>
     <l n="367">The golden cups , yet bright and red .</l>
     <l n="368">And all was so apparelléd</l>
     <l n="369">For guests that came not , yet was all</l>
     <l n="370">As though that servants filled the hall .</l>
     <l n="371">So waxed and waned his hopes , and still</l>
     <l n="372">He formed no wish for good or ill .</l>
     <l n="373">And while he thought of this and that</l>
     <l n="374">Upon his perch the falcon sat</l>
     <l n="375">Unfed , unhooded , his bright eyes</l>
     <l n="376">Beholders of the hard-earned prize ,</l>
     <l n="377">Glancing around him restlessly ,</l>
     <l n="378">As though he knew the time drew nigh</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="380">So little by little fell the sun ,</l>
     <l n="381">From high noon unto sun-setting ;</l>

     <l n="383">Though still he woke , yet none the less</l>
     <l n="384">Was dreaming in his sleeplessness</l>
     <l n="385">Of this and that which he had done</l>
     <l n="386">Before this watch he had begun ;</l>
     <l n="387">Till , with a start , he looked at last</l>
     <l n="388">About him , and all dreams were past ;</l>
     <l n="389">For now , though it was past twilight</l>
     <l n="390">Without , within all grew as bright</l>
     <l n="391">As when the noon-sun smote the wall ,</l>
     <l n="392">Though no lamp shone within the hall .</l>
     <l n="393">Then rose the King upon his feet ,</l>
     <l n="394">And well-nigh heard his own heart beat ,</l>
     <l n="395">And grew all pale for hope and fear ,</l>
     <l n="396">As sound of footsteps caught his ear</l>
     <l n="397">But soft , and as some fair lady ,</l>
     <l n="398">Going as gently as might be ,</l>
     <l n="399">Stopped now and then awhile , distraught</l>
     <l n="400">By pleasant wanderings of sweet thought .</l>
     <l n="401">Nigher the sound came , and more nigh ,</l>
     <l n="402">Until the King unwittingly</l>
     <l n="403">Trembled , and felt his hair arise ,</l>
     <l n="404">But on the door still kept his eyes .</l>
     <l n="405">That opened soon , and in the light</l>
     <l n="406">There stepped alone a lady bright ,</l>
     <l n="407">And made straight toward him up the hall .</l>
     <l n="408">In golden garments was she clad</l>
     <l n="409">And round her waist a belt she had</l>
     <l n="410">Of emeralds fair , and from her feet ,</l>
     <l n="411">That shod with gold the floor did meet ,</l>
     <l n="412">She held the raiment daintily ,</l>
     <l n="413">And on her golden head had she</l>
     <l n="414">A rose-wreath round a pearl-wrought crown ,</l>
     <l n="415">Softly she walked with eyes cast down ,</l>
     <l n="416">Nor looked she any other than</l>
     <l n="417">An earthly lady , though no man</l>
     <l n="418">Has seen so fair a thing as she .</l>
     <l n="419">So when her face the King could see</l>
     <l n="420">Still more he trembled , and he thought ,</l>
     <l n="421">“ Surely my wish is hither brought ,</l>
     <l n="422">And this will be a goodly day</l>
     <l n="423">If for mine own I win this may . ”</l>
     <l n="424">And therewithal she drew anear</l>
     <l n="425">Until the trembling King could hear</l>
     <l n="426">Her very breathing , and she raised</l>
     <l n="427">Her head and on the King 's face gazed</l>
     <l n="428">With serious eyes , and stopping there ,</l>
     <l n="429">Swept from her shoulders her long hair ,</l>
     <l n="430">And let her gown fall on her feet ,</l>
     <l n="431">Then spoke in a clear voice and sweet :</l>
     <l n="432">“ Well hast thou watched , so now , O King ,</l>
     <l n="433">Be bold , and wish for some good thing ;</l>
     <l n="434">And yet , I counsel thee , be wise .</l>
     <l n="435">Behold , spite of these lips and eyes ,</l>
     <l n="436">Hundreds of years old now am I</l>
     <l n="437">And have seen joy and misery .</l>
     <l n="438">And thou , who yet hast lived in bliss .</l>
     <l n="439">I bid thee well consider this ;</l>
     <l n="440">Better it were that men should live</l>
     <l n="441">As beasts , and take what earth can give ,</l>
     <l n="442">The air , the warm sun and the grass</l>
     <l n="443">Until unto the earth they pass ,</l>
     <l n="444">And gain perchance nought worse than rest</l>
     <l n="445">Than that not knowing what is best</l>
     <l n="446">For sons of men , they needs must thirst</l>
     <l n="447">For what shall make their lives accurst .</l>
     <l n="448">“ Therefore I bid thee now beware ,</l>
     <l n="449">Lest getting something seeming fair ,</l>
     <l n="450">Thou com'st in vain to long for more</l>
     <l n="451">Or lest the thing thou wishest for</l>
     <l n="452">Make thee unhappy till thou diest ,</l>
     <l n="453">Or lest with speedy death thou buyest</l>
     <l n="454">A little hour of happiness</l>
     <l n="455">Or lazy joy with sharp distress .</l>
     <l n="456">“ Alas , why say I this to thee ,</l>
     <l n="457">For now I see full certainly ,</l>
     <l n="458">That thou wilt ask for such a thing ,</l>
     <l n="459">It had been best for thee to fling</l>
     <l n="460">Thy body from a mountain-top ,</l>
     <l n="461">Or in a white hot fire to drop ,</l>
     <l n="462">Or ever thou hadst seen me here ,</l>
     <l n="463">Nay then be speedy and speak clear . ”</l>
     <l n="464">Then the King cried out eagerly ,</l>
     <l n="465">Grown fearless , “ Ah , be kind to me !</l>
     <l n="466">Thou knowest what I long for then !</l>
     <l n="467">Thou know'st that I , a king of men ,</l>
     <l n="468">Will ask for nothing else than thee !</l>
     <l n="469">Thou didst not say this could not be ,</l>
     <l n="470">And I have had enough of bliss ,</l>
     <l n="471">If I may end my life with this . ”</l>
     <l n="472">“ Hearken , ” she said , “ what men will say</l>
     <l n="473">When they are mad ; before to-day</l>
     <l n="474">I knew that words such things could mean ,</l>
     <l n="475">And wondered that it could have been .</l>
     <l n="476">“ Think well , because this wished-for joy ,</l>
     <l n="477">That surely will thy bliss destroy ,</l>
     <l n="478">Will let thee live , until thy life</l>
     <l n="479">Is wrapped in such bewildering strife</l>
     <l n="480">That all thy days will seem but ill —</l>
     <l n="481">Now wilt thou wish for this thing still ? ”</l>
     <l n="482">“ Wilt thou then grant it ? ” cried the King ;</l>
     <l n="483">“ Surely thou art an earthly thing ,</l>
     <l n="484">And all this is but mockery ,</l>
     <l n="485">And thou canst tell no more than I</l>
     <l n="486">What ending to my life shall be . ”</l>
     <l n="487">“ Nay , then , ” she said , “ I grant it thee</l>
     <l n="488">Perforce ; come nigh , for I am thine</l>
     <l n="489">Until the morning sun doth shine ,</l>
     <l n="490">And only coming time can prove</l>
     <l n="491">What thing I am . ”</l>
     <l n="492">Dizzy with love ,</l>
     <l n="493">And with surprise struck motionless</l>
     <l n="494">That this divine thing , with far less</l>
     <l n="495">Of striving than a village maid ,</l>
     <l n="496">Had yielded , there he stood afraid ,</l>
     <l n="497">Spite of hot words and passionate ,</l>
     <l n="498">And strove to think upon his fate .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="499">But as he stood there , presently</l>
     <l n="500">With smiling face she drew anigh ,</l>
     <l n="501">And on his face he felt her breath .</l>
     <l n="502">“ O love , ” she said , “ dost thou fear death ?</l>
     <l n="503">Not till next morning shalt thou die ,</l>
     <l n="504">Or fall into thy misery . ”</l>
     <l n="505">Then on his hand her hand did fall ,</l>
     <l n="506">And forth she led him down the hall ,</l>
     <l n="507">Going full softly by his side .</l>
     <l n="508">“ O love , ” she said , “ now well betide</l>
     <l n="509">The day whereon thou cam'st to me .</l>
     <l n="510">I would this night a year might be ,</l>
     <l n="511">Yea , life-long ; such life as we have ,</l>
     <l n="512">A thousand years from womb to grave . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="513">And then that clinging hand seemed worth</l>
     <l n="514">Whatever joy was left on earth ,</l>
     <l n="515">And every trouble he forgot ,</l>
     <l n="516">And time and death remembered not :</l>
     <l n="517">Kinder she grew , she clung to him</l>
     <l n="518">With loving arms , her eyes did swim</l>
     <l n="519">With love and pity , as he strove</l>
     <l n="520">To show the wisdom of his love ;</l>
     <l n="521">With trembling lips she praised his choice ,</l>
     <l n="522">And said , “ Ah , well may'st thou rejoice ,</l>
     <l n="523">Well may'st thou think this one short night</l>

     <l n="840">A ruined rout of bad and good ,</l>
     <l n="841">With whom within the tangled wood ,</l>
     <l n="842">The rugged mountain , he abode ,</l>
     <l n="843">And thenceforth oftentimes they rode</l>
     <l n="844">Into the fair land once called his ,</l>
     <l n="845">And yet but little came of this ,</l>
     <l n="846">Except more woe for Heaven to see</l>
     <l n="847">Some little added misery</l>
     <l n="848">Unto that miserable realm :</l>
     <l n="849">The barbarous foe did overwhelm</l>
     <l n="850">The cities and the fertile plain ,</l>
     <l n="851">And many a peaceful man was slain ,</l>
     <l n="852">And many a maiden brought to shame .</l>
     <l n="853">And yielded towns were set aflame ;</l>
     <l n="854">For all the land was masterless .</l>
     <l n="855">Long dwelt the King in great distress ,</l>
     <l n="856">From wood to mountain ever tost ,</l>
     <l n="857">Mourning for all that he had lost ,</l>
     <l n="858">Until it chanced upon a day ,</l>
     <l n="859">Asleep in early morn he lay ,</l>
     <l n="860">And in a vision there did see</l>
     <l n="861">Clad all in black , that fay lady</l>
     <l n="862">Whereby all this had come to pass ,</l>
     <l n="863">But dim as in a misty glass :</l>
     <l n="864">She said , “ I come thy death to tell</l>
     <l n="865">Yet now to thee may say ‘ farewell , ’</l>
     <l n="866">For in a short space wilt thou be</l>
     <l n="867">Within an endless dim country</l>
     <l n="868">Where thou may'st well win woe or bliss , ”</l>
     <l n="869">Therewith she stooped his lips to kiss</l>
     <l n="870">And vanished straightway from his sight .</l>
     <l n="871">So waking there he sat upright</l>
     <l n="872">And looked around , but nought could see</l>
     <l n="873">And heard but song-birds ’ melody ,</l>
     <l n="874">For that was the first break of day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="875">Then with a sigh adown he lay</l>
     <l n="876">And slept , nor ever woke again ,</l>
     <l n="877">For in that hour was he slain</l>
     <l n="878">By stealthy traitors as he slept .</l>
     <l n="879">He of a few was much bewept ,</l>
     <l n="880">But of most men was well forgot</l>
     <l n="881">While the town 's ashes still were hot</l>
     <l n="882">The foeman on that day did burn .</l>
     <l n="883">As for the land , great Time did turn</l>
     <l n="884">The bloody fields to deep green grass ,</l>
     <l n="885">And from the minds of men did pass</l>
     <l n="886">The memory of that time of woe ,</l>
     <l n="887">And at this day all things are so</l>
     <l n="888">As first I said ; a land it is</l>
     <l n="889">Where men may dwell in rest and bliss</l>
     <l n="890">If so they will — Who yet will not ,</l>
     <l n="891">Because their hasty hearts are hot</l>
     <l n="892">With foolish hate , and longing vain</l>
     <l n="893">The sire and dam of grief and pain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="894">Neath the bright sky cool grew the weary earth ,</l>
     <l n="895">And many a bud in that fair hour had birth</l>
     <l n="896">Upon the garden bushes ; in the west</l>
     <l n="897">The sky got ready for the great sun 's rest ,</l>
     <l n="898">And all was fresh and lovely ; none the less</l>
     <l n="899">Although those old men shared the happiness</l>
     <l n="900">Of the bright eve , ‘ twas mixed with memories</l>
     <l n="901">Of how they might in old times have been wise ,</l>
     <l n="902">Not casting by for very wilfulness</l>
     <l n="903">What wealth might come their changing life to bless ;</l>
     <l n="904">Lulling their hearts to sleep , amid the cold</l>
     <l n="905">Of bitter times , that so they might behold</l>
     <l n="906">Some joy at last , e'en if it lingered long .</l>
     <l n="907">That , wearing not their souls with grief and wrong ,</l>
     <l n="908">They still might watch the changing world go by ,</l>
     <l n="909">Content to live , content at last to die .</l>
     <l n="910">Alas ! if they had reached content at last</l>
     <l n="911">It was perforce when all their strength was past ;</l>
     <l n="912">And after loss of many days once bright ,</l>
     <l n="913">With foolish hopes of unattained delight .</l>

    <head>PYGMALION AND THE IMAGE .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>A man of Cyprus , a sculptor named Pygmalion , made an image of a woman , fairer than any that had yet been seen , and in the end came to love his own handiwork as though it had been alive : wherefore , praying to Venus for help , he obtained his end , for she made the image alive indeed , and a woman , and Pygmalion wedded her .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">At Amathus , that from the southern side</l>
     <l n="2">Of Cyprus , looks across the Syrian sea ,</l>
     <l n="3">There did in ancient time a man abide</l>
     <l n="4">Known to the island-dwellers , for that he</l>
     <l n="5">Had wrought most godlike works in imagery ,</l>
     <l n="6">And day by day still greater honour won ,</l>
     <l n="7">Which man our old books call Pygmalion .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">Yet in the praise of men small joy he had ,</l>
     <l n="9">But walked abroad with downcast brooding face .</l>
     <l n="10">Nor yet by any damsel was made glad ;</l>
     <l n="11">For , sooth to say , the women of that place</l>
     <l n="12">Must seem to all men an accursed race ,</l>
     <l n="13">Who with the Turner of all Hearts once strove</l>
     <l n="14">And now their hearts must carry lust for love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">Upon a day it chanced that he had been</l>
     <l n="16">About the streets , and on the crowded quays ,</l>
     <l n="17">Rich with unopened wealth of bales , had seen</l>
     <l n="18">The dark-eyed merchants of the southern seas</l>
     <l n="19">In chaffer with the base Propoetides ,</l>
     <l n="20">And heavy-hearted gat him home again ,</l>
     <l n="21">His once-loved life grown idle , poor , and vain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="22">And there upon his images he cast</l>
     <l n="23">His weary eyes , yet little noted them ,</l>
     <l n="24">As still from name to name his swift thought passed .</l>
     <l n="25">For what to him was Juno 's well-wrought hem ,</l>
     <l n="26">Diana 's shaft , or Pallas ’ olive-stem ?</l>
     <l n="27">What help could Hermes ’ rod unto him give ,</l>
     <l n="28">Until with shadowy things he came to live ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="29">Yet note , that though , while looking on the sun ,</l>
     <l n="30">The craftsman o'er his work some morn of spring</l>
     <l n="31">May chide his useless labour never done ,</l>
     <l n="32">For all his murmurs , with no other thing</l>
     <l n="33">He soothes his heart , and dulls thought 's poisonous sting ,</l>
     <l n="34">And thus in thought 's despite the world goes on ;</l>
     <l n="35">And so it was with this Pygmalion .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="36">Unto the chisel must he set his hand ,</l>
     <l n="37">And slowly , still in troubled thought must pace ,</l>
     <l n="38">About a work begun , that there doth stand ,</l>
     <l n="39">And still returning to the self-same place ,</l>
     <l n="40">Unto the image now must set his face ,</l>
     <l n="41">And with a sigh his wonted toil begin ,</l>
     <l n="42">Half-loathed , half-loved , a little rest to win .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="43">The lessening marble that he worked upon ,</l>
     <l n="44">A woman 's form now imaged doubtfully ,</l>
     <l n="45">And in such guise the work had he begun ,</l>
     <l n="46">Because when he the untouched block did see</l>
     <l n="47">In wandering veins that form there seemed to be ,</l>
     <l n="48">Whereon he cried out in a careless mood ,</l>
     <l n="49">“ O lady Venus , make this presage good !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="50">“ And then this block of stone shall be thy maid ,</l>
     <l n="51">And , not without rich golden ornament ,</l>
     <l n="52">Shall bide within thy quivering myrtle-shade . ”</l>
     <l n="53">So spoke he , but the goddess , well content ,</l>
     <l n="54">Unto his hand such godlike mastery sent ,</l>
     <l n="55">That like the first artificer he wrought ,</l>
     <l n="56">Who made the gift that woe to all men brought .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="57">And yet , but such as he was wont to do ,</l>
     <l n="58">At first indeed that work divine he deemed ,</l>
     <l n="59">And as the white chips from the chisel flew</l>
     <l n="60">Of other matters languidly he dreamed ,</l>
     <l n="61">For easy to his hand that labour seemed ,</l>
     <l n="62">And he was stirred with many a troubling thought ,</l>
     <l n="63">And many a doubt perplexed him as he wrought .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="64">And yet , again , at last there came a day</l>
     <l n="65">When smoother and more shapely grew the stone</l>
     <l n="66">And he , grown eager , put all thought away</l>
     <l n="67">But that which touched his craftsmanship alone ,</l>
     <l n="68">And he would gaze at what his hands had done ,</l>
     <l n="69">Until his heart with boundless joy would swell</l>
     <l n="70">That all was wrought so wonderfully well .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="71">Yet long it was ere he was satisfied ,</l>
     <l n="72">And with the pride that by his mastery</l>
     <l n="73">This thing was done , whose equal far and wide</l>
     <l n="74">In no town of the world a man could see ,</l>
     <l n="75">Came burning longing that the work should be</l>
     <l n="76">E'en better still , and to his heart there came</l>
     <l n="77">A strange and strong desire he could not name .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="78">The night seemed long , and long the twilight seemed ,</l>
     <l n="79">A vain thing seemed his flowery garden fair ;</l>
     <l n="80">Though through the night still of his work he dreamed ,</l>
     <l n="81">And though his smooth-stemmed trees so nigh it were ,</l>
     <l n="82">That thence he could behold the marble hair ;</l>
     <l n="83">Nought was enough , until with steel in hand</l>
     <l n="84">He came before the wondrous stone to stand .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="85">No song could charm him , and no histories</l>
     <l n="86">Of men 's misdoings could avail him now ,</l>
     <l n="87">Nay , scarcely seaward had he turned his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="88">If men had said , “ The fierce Tyrrhenians row</l>
     <l n="89">Up through the bay , rise up and strike a blow</l>
     <l n="90">For life and goods ; ” for nought to him seemed dear</l>
     <l n="91">But to his well-loved work to be anear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="92">Then vexed he grew , and knowing not his heart ,</l>
     <l n="93">Unto himself he said , “ Ah , what is this ,</l>
     <l n="94">That I who oft was happy to depart ,</l>
     <l n="95">And wander where the boughs each other kiss</l>
     <l n="96">‘ Neath the west wind , now have no other bliss</l>
     <l n="97">But in vain smoothing of this marble maid ,</l>
     <l n="98">Whose chips this month a drachma had outweighed ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="99">“ Lo I will get me to the woods and try</l>
     <l n="100">If I my woodcraft have forgotten quite ,</l>
     <l n="101">And then , returning , lay this folly by ,</l>
     <l n="102">And eat my fill , and sleep my sleep anight ,</l>
     <l n="103">And ‘ gin to carve a Hercules aright</l>
     <l n="104">Upon the morrow , and perchance indeed</l>
     <l n="105">The Theban will be good to me at need . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="106">With that he took his quiver and his bow ,</l>
     <l n="107">And through the gates of Amathus he went ,</l>
     <l n="108">And toward the mountain slopes began to go ,</l>
     <l n="109">Within the woods to work out his intent .</l>
     <l n="110">Fair was the day , the honied beanfield 's scent</l>
     <l n="111">The west wind bore unto him , o'er the way</l>
     <l n="112">The glittering noisy poplar leaves did play .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="113">All things were moving ; as his hurried feet</l>
     <l n="114">Passed by , within the flowery swathe he heard</l>
     <l n="115">The sweeping of the scythe , the swallow fleet</l>
     <l n="116">Rose over him , the sitting partridge stirred</l>
     <l n="117">On the field 's edge ; the brown bee by him whirred ,</l>
     <l n="118">Or murmured in the clover flowers below .</l>
     <l n="119">But he with bowed-down head failed not to go .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="120">At last he stopped , and , looking round , he said ,</l>
     <l n="121">“ Like one whose thirtieth year is well gone by ,</l>
     <l n="122">The day is getting ready to be dead ;</l>
     <l n="123">No rest , and on the border of the sky</l>
     <l n="124">Already the great banks of dark haze lie ;</l>
     <l n="125">No rest — what do I midst this stir and noise ?</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="127">With that he turned , and toward the city-gate</l>
     <l n="128">Through the sweet fields went swifter than he came ,</l>
     <l n="129">And cast his heart into the hands of fate ;</l>
     <l n="130">Nor strove with it , when higher ‘ gan to flame</l>
     <l n="131">That strange and strong desire without a name ;</l>
     <l n="132">Till panting , thinking of nought else , once more</l>
     <l n="133">His hand was on the latch of his own door .</l>

     <l n="134">One moment there he lingered , as he said ,</l>

     <l n="137">To hear his own lips name a thing of stone ,</l>
     <l n="138">As though the gods some marvel there had done ,</l>
     <l n="139">And made his work alive ; and therewithal</l>
     <l n="140">In turn great pallor on his face did fall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="141">But with a sigh he passed into the house ,</l>

     <l n="144">Until his heart should wax a little bold ;</l>
     <l n="145">Then entering , motionless and white and cold ,</l>
     <l n="146">He saw the image stand amidst the floor</l>

    <head>When Ogier was born , six fay ladies came to the cradle where he lay , and gave him various gifts , as to be brave and happy and the like ; but the sixth gave him to be her love when he should have lived long in the world : so Ogier grew up and became the greatest of knights , and at last , after many years , fell into the hands of that fay , and with her , as the story tells , he lives now , though he returned once to the world , as is shown in the process of this tale .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Within some Danish city by the sea ,</l>
     <l n="2">Whose name , changed now , is all unknown to me ,</l>
     <l n="3">Great mourning was there one fair summer eve ,</l>
     <l n="4">Because the angels , bidden to receive</l>
     <l n="5">The fair Queen 's lovely soul in Paradise ,</l>
     <l n="6">Had done their bidding , and in royal guise</l>
     <l n="7">Her helpless body , once the prize of love ,</l>
     <l n="8">Unable now for fear or hope to move ,</l>
     <l n="9">Lay underneath the golden canopy ;</l>
     <l n="10">And bowed down by unkingly misery</l>
     <l n="11">The King sat by it , and not far away ,</l>
     <l n="12">Within the chamber a fair man-child lay ,</l>
     <l n="13">His mother 's bane , the king that was to be ,</l>
     <l n="14">Not witting yet of any royalty ,</l>
     <l n="15">Harmless and loved , although so new to life .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="16">Calm the June evening was , no sign of strife</l>
     <l n="17">The clear sky showed , no storm grew round the sun ,</l>
     <l n="18">Unhappy that his day of bliss was done ;</l>
     <l n="19">Dumb was the sea , and if the beech-wood stirred ,</l>
     <l n="20">‘ Twas with the nestling of the grey-winged bird</l>
     <l n="21">Midst its thick leaves ; and though the nightingale</l>
     <l n="22">Her ancient , hapless sorrow must bewail ,</l>
     <l n="23">No more of woe there seemed within her song</l>
     <l n="24">Than such as doth to lovers ’ words belong ,</l>
     <l n="25">Because their love is still unsatisfied .</l>
     <l n="26">But to the King , on that sweet eventide ,</l>
     <l n="27">No earth there seemed , no heaven when earth was gone ;</l>
     <l n="28">No help , no God ! but lonely pain alone ;</l>
     <l n="29">And he , midst unreal shadows , seemed to sit</l>
     <l n="30">Himself the very heart and soul of it .</l>
     <l n="31">But round the cradle of the new-born child</l>
     <l n="32">The nurses now the weary time beguiled</l>
     <l n="33">With stories of the just departed Queen ;</l>
     <l n="34">And how , amid the heathen folk first seen ,</l>
     <l n="35">She had been won to love and godliness ;</l>
     <l n="36">And as they spoke , e'en midst his dull distress ,</l>
     <l n="37">An eager whisper now and then did smite</l>
     <l n="38">Upon the King 's ear , of some past delight ,</l>
     <l n="39">Some once familiar name , and he would raise</l>
     <l n="40">His weary head , and on the speaker gaze</l>
     <l n="41">Like one about to speak , but soon again</l>
     <l n="42">Would drop his head and be alone with pain ,</l>
     <l n="43">Nor think of these ; who , silent in their turn ,</l>
     <l n="44">Would sit and watch the waxen tapers burn</l>
     <l n="45">Amidst the dusk of the quick-gathering night ,</l>
     <l n="46">Until beneath the high stars ’ glimmering light ,</l>
     <l n="47">The fresh earth lay in colourless repose .</l>
     <l n="48">So passed the night , and now and then one rose</l>
     <l n="49">From out her place to do what might avail</l>
     <l n="50">To still the new-born infant 's fretful wail ;</l>
     <l n="51">Or through the softly-opened door there came</l>
     <l n="52">Some nurse new waked , who , whispering low the name</l>
     <l n="53">Of her whose turn was come , would take her place ;</l>
     <l n="54">Then toward the King would turn about her face</l>
     <l n="55">And to her fellows whisper of the day ,</l>
     <l n="56">And tell again of her just past away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="57">So waned the hours , the moon arose and grew ,</l>
     <l n="58">From off the sea a little west-wind blew ,</l>
     <l n="59">Rustling the garden-leaves like sudden rain ;</l>
     <l n="60">And ere the moon began to fall again</l>
     <l n="61">The wind grew cold , a change was in the sky ,</l>
     <l n="62">And in deep silence did the dawn draw nigh :</l>
     <l n="63">Then from her place a nurse arose to light</l>
     <l n="64">Fresh hallowed lights , for , dying with the night ,</l>
     <l n="65">The tapers round about the dead Queen were ;</l>
     <l n="66">But the King raised his head and ‘ gan to stare</l>
     <l n="67">Upon her , as her sweeping gown did glide</l>
     <l n="68">About the floor , that in the stillness cried</l>
     <l n="69">Beneath her careful feet ; and now as she</l>
     <l n="70">Had lit the second candle carefully ,</l>
     <l n="71">And on its silver spike another one</l>
     <l n="72">Was setting , through her body did there run</l>
     <l n="73">A sudden tremor , and the hand was stayed</l>
     <l n="74">That on the dainty painted wax was laid ;</l>
     <l n="75">Her eyelids fell down and she seemed to sleep ,</l>
     <l n="76">And o'er the staring King began to creep</l>
     <l n="77">Sweet slumber too ; the bitter lines of woe</l>
     <l n="78">That drew his weary face did softer grow ,</l>
     <l n="79">His eyelids dropped , his arms fell to his side ;</l>
     <l n="80">And moveless in their places did abide</l>
     <l n="81">The nursing women , held by some strong spell ,</l>
     <l n="82">E'en as they were , and utter silence fell</l>
     <l n="83">Upon the mournful , glimmering chamber fair .</l>
     <l n="84">But now light footsteps coming up the stair ,</l>
     <l n="85">Smote on the deadly stillness , and the sound</l>
     <l n="86">Of silken dresses trailing o'er the ground ;</l>
     <l n="87">And heavenly odours through the chamber passed ,</l>
     <l n="88">Unlike the scents that rose and lily cast</l>
     <l n="89">Upon the freshness of the dying night ;</l>
     <l n="90">Then nigher drew the sound of footsteps light</l>
     <l n="91">Until the door swung open noiselessly —</l>
     <l n="92">A mass of sunlit flowers there seemed to be</l>
     <l n="93">Within the doorway , and but pale and wan</l>
     <l n="94">The flame showed now that serveth mortal man ,</l>
     <l n="95">As one by one six seeming ladies passed</l>
     <l n="96">Into the room , and o'er its sorrow cast</l>
     <l n="97">That thoughtless sense of joy bewildering ,</l>
     <l n="98">That kisses youthful hearts amidst of spring ;</l>
     <l n="99">Crowned were they , in such glorious raiment clad ,</l>
     <l n="100">As yet no merchant of the world has had</l>
     <l n="101">Within his coffers ; yet those crowns seemed fair</l>
     <l n="102">Only because they kissed their odorous hair ,</l>
     <l n="103">And all that flowery raiment was but blessed</l>
     <l n="104">By those fair bodies that its splendour pressed .</l>
     <l n="105">Now to the cradle from that glorious band ,</l>
     <l n="106">A woman passed , and laid a tender hand</l>
     <l n="107">Upon the babe , and gently drew aside</l>
     <l n="108">The swathings soft that did his body hide ;</l>
     <l n="109">And , seeing him so fair and great , she smiled ,</l>
     <l n="110">And stooped , and kissed him , saying , “ O noble child ,</l>
     <l n="111">Have thou a gift from Gloriande this day ;</l>
     <l n="112">For to the time when life shall pass away</l>
     <l n="113">From this dear heart , no fear of death or shame ,</l>
     <l n="114">No weariness of good shall foul thy name . ”</l>
     <l n="115">So saying , to her sisters she returned ;</l>
     <l n="116">And one came forth , upon whose brow there burned</l>
     <l n="117">A crown of rubies , and whose heaving breast</l>
     <l n="118">With happy rings a golden hauberk pressed ;</l>
     <l n="119">She took the babe , and somewhat frowning said ,</l>
     <l n="120">“ This gift I give , that till thy limbs are laid</l>
     <l n="121">At rest for ever , to thine honoured life</l>
     <l n="122">There never shall be lacking war and strife ,</l>
     <l n="123">That thou a long-enduring name mayst win ,</l>
     <l n="124">And by thy deeds , good pardon for thy sin . ”</l>
     <l n="125">With that another , who , unseen , meanwhile</l>
     <l n="126">Had drawn anigh , said with a joyous smile ,</l>
     <l n="127">“ And this forgotten gift to thee I give ,</l>
     <l n="128">That while amidst the turmoil thou dost live ,</l>
     <l n="129">Still shalt thou win the game , and unto thee</l>
     <l n="130">Defeat and shame but idle words shall be . ”</l>
     <l n="131">Then back they turned , and therewithal , the fourth</l>
     <l n="132">Said , “ Take this gift for what it may be worth</l>
     <l n="133">For that is mine to give ; lo , thou shalt be</l>
     <l n="134">Gentle of speech , and in all courtesy</l>
     <l n="135">The first of men : a little gift this is ,</l>
     <l n="136">After these promises of fame and bliss . ”</l>
     <l n="137">Then toward the babe the fifth fair woman went ;</l>
     <l n="138">Grey-eyed she was , and simple , with eyes bent</l>
     <l n="139">Down on the floor , parted her red lips were ,</l>
     <l n="140">And o'er her sweet face marvellously fair</l>
     <l n="141">Oft would the colour spread full suddenly ;</l>
     <l n="142">Clad in a dainty gown and thin was she ,</l>
     <l n="143">For some green summer of the fay-land dight ,</l>
     <l n="144">Tripping she went , and laid her fingers light</l>
     <l n="145">Upon the child , and said , “ O little one ,</l>
     <l n="146">As long as thou shalt look upon the sun</l>
     <l n="147">Shall women long for thee ; take heed to this</l>
     <l n="148">And give them what thou canst of love and bliss . ”</l>
     <l n="149">Then , blushing for her words , therefrom she past ,</l>
     <l n="150">And by the cradle stood the sixth and last ,</l>
     <l n="151">The fairest of them all ; awhile she gazed</l>
     <l n="152">Down on the child , and then her hand she raised ,</l>
     <l n="153">And made the one side of her bosom bare ;</l>
     <l n="154">“ Ogier , ” she said , “ if this be foul or fair</l>
     <l n="155">Thou know'st not now , but when thine earthly life</l>
     <l n="156">Is drunk out to the dregs , and war and strife</l>
     <l n="157">Have yielded thee whatever joy they may ,</l>
     <l n="158">Thine head upon this bosom shalt thou lay ;</l>
     <l n="159">And then , despite of knowledge or of God ,</l>
     <l n="160">Will we be glad upon the flowery sod</l>
     <l n="161">Within the happy country where I dwell :</l>
     <l n="162">Ogier , my love that is to be , farewell ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="163">She turned , and even as they came they passed</l>
     <l n="164">From out the place , and reached the gate at last</l>
     <l n="165">That oped before their feet , and speedily</l>
     <l n="166">They gained the edges of the murmuring sea ,</l>
     <l n="167">And as they stood in silence , gazing there</l>
     <l n="168">Out to the west , they vanished into air ,</l>
     <l n="169">I know not how , nor whereto they returned .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="170">But mixed with twilight in the chamber burned</l>
     <l n="171">The flickering candles , and those dreary folk ,</l>
     <l n="172">Unlike to sleepers , from their trance awoke ,</l>
     <l n="173">But nought of what had happed meanwhile they knew</l>
     <l n="174">Through the half-opened casements now there blew</l>
     <l n="175">A sweet fresh air , that of the flowers and sea</l>
     <l n="176">Mingled together , smelt deliciously ,</l>
     <l n="177">And from the unseen sun the spreading light</l>
     <l n="178">Began to make the fair June blossoms bright ,</l>
     <l n="179">And midst their weary woe uprose the sun ,</l>
     <l n="180">And thus has Ogier 's noble life begun .</l>

     <l n="181">Hope is our life , when first our life grows clear ;</l>
     <l n="182">Hope and delight , scarce crossed by lines of fear ,</l>

     <l n="184">But forasmuch as we with life must cope ,</l>
     <l n="185">Struggling with this and that , who knoweth why ?</l>
     <l n="186">Hope will not give us up to certainty ,</l>

     <l n="190">When he no more on earth may have his home .</l>
     <l n="191">Great things he suffered , great delights he had ,</l>

     <l n="353">Faces he knew of old , yet none the less</l>
     <l n="354">He seemed the same , and , midst that mightiness ,</l>

     <l n="362">But while he sat and waited for the day</l>
     <l n="363">A sudden light across the bare rock streamed ,</l>

     <l n="365">The moon her fleecy veil had broken through ;</l>
     <l n="366">But ruddier indeed this new light grew</l>
     <l n="367">Than were the moon 's grey beams , and , therewithal</l>
     <l n="368">Soft far-off music on his ears did fall ;</l>
     <l n="369">Yet moved he not , but murmured , “ This is death .</l>
     <l n="370">An easy thing like this to yield my breath ,</l>
     <l n="371">Awake , yet dreaming , with no sounds of fear ,</l>
     <l n="372">No dreadful sights to tell me it is near ;</l>
     <l n="373">Yea , God , I thank Thee ! ” but with that last word</l>
     <l n="374">It seemed to him that he his own name heard</l>
     <l n="375">Whispered , as though the wind had borne it past ;</l>
     <l n="376">With that he gat unto his feet at last ,</l>
     <l n="377">But still awhile he stood , with sunken head ,</l>
     <l n="378">And in a low and trembling voice he said ,</l>
     <l n="379">“ Lord , I am ready , whither shall I go ?</l>
     <l n="380">I pray Thee unto me some token show . ”</l>
     <l n="381">And , as he said this , round about he turned ,</l>
     <l n="382">And in the east beheld a light that burned</l>
     <l n="383">As bright as day ; then , though his flesh might fear</l>
     <l n="384">The coming change that he believed so near ,</l>
     <l n="385">Yet did his soul rejoice , for now he thought</l>
     <l n="386">Unto the very heaven to be brought :</l>
     <l n="387">And though he felt alive , deemed it might be</l>
     <l n="388">That he in sleep had died full easily .</l>
     <l n="389">Then toward that light did he begin to go ,</l>
     <l n="390">And still those strains he heard , far off and low ,</l>
     <l n="391">That grew no louder ; still that bright light streamed</l>
     <l n="392">Over the rocks , yet nothing brighter seemed ,</l>
     <l n="393">But like the light of some unseen bright flame</l>
     <l n="394">Shone round about , until at last he came</l>
     <l n="395">Unto the dreary islet 's other shore ,</l>
     <l n="396">And then the minstrelsy he heard no more ,</l>
     <l n="397">And softer seemed the strange light unto him ,</l>
     <l n="398">But yet or ever it had grown quite dim ,</l>
     <l n="399">Beneath its waning light could he behold</l>
     <l n="400">A mighty palace set about with gold ,</l>
     <l n="401">Above green meads and groves of summer trees</l>
     <l n="402">Far-off across the welter of the seas ;</l>
     <l n="403">But , as he gazed , it faded from his sight ,</l>
     <l n="404">And the grey hidden moon 's diffused soft light ,</l>
     <l n="405">Which soothly was but darkness to him now ,</l>
     <l n="406">His sea-girt island prison did but show .</l>
     <l n="407">But o'er the sea he still gazed wistfully ,</l>
     <l n="408">And said , “ Alas ! and when will this go by</l>
     <l n="409">And leave my soul in peace ? must I still dream</l>
     <l n="410">Of life that once so dear a thing did seem ,</l>
     <l n="411">That , when I wake , death may the bitterer be ?</l>
     <l n="412">Here will I sit until he come to me ,</l>
     <l n="413">And hide mine eyes and think upon my sin ,</l>
     <l n="414">That so a little calm I yet may win</l>
     <l n="415">Before I stand within the awful place . ”</l>
     <l n="416">Then down he sat and covered up his face .</l>
     <l n="417">Yet therewithal his trouble could not hide ,</l>
     <l n="418">Nor waiting thus for death could he abide ,</l>
     <l n="419">For , though he knew it not , the yearning pain</l>
     <l n="420">Of hope of life had touched his soul again —</l>
     <l n="421">If he could live awhile , if he could live !</l>
     <l n="422">The mighty being , who once was wont to give</l>
     <l n="423">The gift of life to many a trembling man ;</l>
     <l n="424">Who did his own will since his life began ;</l>
     <l n="425">Who feared not aught , but strong and great and free</l>
     <l n="426">Still cast aside the thought of what might be ;</l>
     <l n="427">Must all this then be lost , and with no will ,</l>
     <l n="428">Powerless and blind , must he some fate fulfil ,</l>
     <l n="429">Nor know what he is doing any more ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="430">Soon he arose and paced along the shore ,</l>
     <l n="431">And gazed out seaward for the blessed light ;</l>
     <l n="432">But nought he saw except the old sad sight ,</l>
     <l n="433">The ceaseless tumbling of the billows grey ,</l>
     <l n="434">The white upspringing of the spurts of spray</l>
     <l n="435">Amidst that mass of timbers , the rent bones</l>
     <l n="436">Of the sea-houses of the hapless ones</l>
     <l n="437">Once cast like him upon this deadly isle .</l>
     <l n="438">He stopped his pacing in a little while ,</l>
     <l n="439">And clenched his mighty hands , and set his teeth ,</l>
     <l n="440">And gazing at the ruin underneath ,</l>
     <l n="441">He swung from off the bare cliff 's jagged brow ,</l>
     <l n="442">And on some slippery ledge he wavered now ,</l>
     <l n="443">Without a hand-hold , and now stoutly clung</l>
     <l n="444">With hands alone , and o'er the welter hung ,</l>
     <l n="445">Not caring aught if thus his life should end ;</l>
     <l n="446">But safely amidst all this did he descend</l>
     <l n="447">The dreadful cliff , and since no beach was there ,</l>
     <l n="448">But from the depths the rock rose stark and bare ,</l>
     <l n="449">Nor crumbled aught beneath the hammering sea ,</l>
     <l n="450">Upon the wrecks he stood unsteadily .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="451">But now , amid the clamour of the waves ,</l>
     <l n="452">And washing to-and-fro of beams and staves ,</l>
     <l n="453">Dizzy with hunger , dreamy with distress ,</l>
     <l n="454">And all those days of fear and loneliness ,</l>
     <l n="455">The ocean 's tumult seemed the battle 's roar ,</l>
     <l n="456">His heart grew hot , as when in days of yore</l>
     <l n="457">He heard the cymbals clash amid the crowd</l>
     <l n="458">Of dusky faces ; now he shouted loud ,</l>
     <l n="459">And from crushed beam to beam began to leap ,</l>
     <l n="460">And yet his footing somehow did he keep</l>
     <l n="461">Amidst their tossing , and indeed the sea</l>
     <l n="462">Was somewhat sunk upon the island 's lee .</l>
     <l n="463">So quickly on from wreck to wreck he passed ,</l>
     <l n="464">And reached the outer line of wrecks at last ,</l>
     <l n="465">And there a moment stood unsteadily ,</l>
     <l n="466">Amid the drift of spray that hurried by ,</l>
     <l n="467">And drew Courtain his sword from out its sheath ,</l>
     <l n="468">And poised himself to meet the coming death ,</l>
     <l n="469">Still looking out to sea ; but as he gazed ,</l>
     <l n="470">And once or twice his doubtful feet he raised</l>
     <l n="471">To take the final plunge , that heavenly strain</l>
     <l n="472">Over the washing waves he heard again ,</l>
     <l n="473">And from the dimness something bright he saw</l>
     <l n="474">Across the waste of waters towards him draw ;</l>
     <l n="475">And hidden now , now raised aloft , at last</l>
     <l n="476">Unto his very feet a boat was cast ,</l>
     <l n="477">Gilded inside and out , and well arrayed</l>
     <l n="478">With cushions soft ; far fitter to have weighed</l>
     <l n="479">From some sweet garden on the shallow Seine ,</l>
     <l n="480">Or in a reach of green Thames to have lain ,</l>
     <l n="481">Than struggle with that huge confuséd sea ;</l>
     <l n="482">But Ogier gazed upon it doubtfully</l>
     <l n="483">One moment , and then , sheathing Courtain , said ,</l>
     <l n="484">“ What tales are these about the newly dead</l>
     <l n="485">The heathen told ? what matter , let all pass ;</l>
     <l n="486">This moment as one dead indeed I was ,</l>
     <l n="487">And this must be what I have got to do ,</l>
     <l n="488">I yet perchance may light on something new</l>
     <l n="489">Before I die ; though yet perchance this keel</l>
     <l n="490">Unto the wondrous mass of charméd steel</l>
     <l n="491">Is drawn as others . ” With that word he leapt</l>
     <l n="492">Into the boat , and o'er the cushions crept</l>
     <l n="493">From stem to stern , but found no rudder there ,</l>
     <l n="494">Nor any oars , nor were the cushions fair</l>
     <l n="495">Made wet by any dashing of the sea .</l>
     <l n="496">Now while he pondered how these things could be ,</l>
     <l n="497">The boat began to move therefrom at last ,</l>
     <l n="498">But over him a drowsiness was cast ,</l>
     <l n="499">And as o'er tumbling hills the skiff did pass ,</l>
     <l n="500">He clean forgot his death and where he was .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="501">At last he woke up to a sunny day ,</l>
     <l n="502">And , looking round , saw that his shallop lay</l>
     <l n="503">Moored at the edge of some fair tideless sea</l>
     <l n="504">Unto an overhanging thick-leaved tree ,</l>
     <l n="505">Where in the green waves did the low bank dip</l>
     <l n="506">Its fresh and green grass-covered daisied lip ;</l>
     <l n="507">But Ogier looking thence no more could see</l>
     <l n="508">That sad abode of death and misery ,</l>
     <l n="509">Nor aught but wide and empty ocean , grey</l>
     <l n="510">With gathering haze , for now it neared midday ;</l>
     <l n="511">Then from the golden cushions did he rise ,</l>
     <l n="512">And wondering still if this were Paradise</l>
     <l n="513">He stepped ashore , but drew Courtain his sword</l>
     <l n="514">And muttered therewithal a holy word .</l>
     <l n="515">Fair was the place , as though amidst of May ,</l>
     <l n="516">Nor did the brown birds fear the sunny day ,</l>
     <l n="517">For with their quivering song the air was sweet ;</l>
     <l n="518">Thick grew the field-flowers underneath his feet ,</l>
     <l n="519">And on his head the blossoms down did rain ,</l>
     <l n="520">Yet mid these fair things slowly and with pain</l>
     <l n="521">He ‘ gan to go , yea , even when his foot</l>
     <l n="522">First touched the flowery sod , to his heart 's root</l>
     <l n="523">A coldness seemed to strike , and now each limb</l>
     <l n="524">Was growing stiff , his eyes waxed bleared and dim ,</l>
     <l n="525">And all his stored-up memory ‘ gan to fail ,</l>
     <l n="526">Nor yet would his once mighty heart avail</l>
     <l n="527">For lamentations o'er his changéd lot ;</l>
     <l n="528">Yet urged by some desire , he knew not what ,</l>
     <l n="529">Along a little path ‘ twixt hedges sweet ,</l>
     <l n="530">Drawn sword in hand , he dragged his faltering feet ,</l>
     <l n="531">For what then seemed to him a weary way ,</l>
     <l n="532">Whereon his steps he needs must often stay</l>
     <l n="533">And lean upon the mighty well-worn sword</l>
     <l n="534">That in those hands , grown old , for king or lord</l>
     <l n="535">Had small respect in glorious days long past .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="536">But still he crept along , and at the last</l>
     <l n="537">Came to a gilded wicket , and through this</l>
     <l n="538">Entered a garden fit for utmost bliss ,</l>
     <l n="539">If that might last which needs must soon go by :</l>
     <l n="540">There ‘ gainst a tree he leaned , and with a sigh</l>
     <l n="541">He said , “ O God , a sinner I have been ,</l>
     <l n="542">And good it is that I these things have seen</l>
     <l n="543">Before I meet what Thou hast set apart</l>
     <l n="544">To cleanse the earthly folly from my heart ;</l>
     <l n="545">But who within this garden now can dwell</l>
     <l n="546">Wherein guilt first upon the world befell ? ”</l>
     <l n="547">A little further yet he staggered on ,</l>
     <l n="548">Till to a fountain-side at last he won ,</l>
     <l n="549">O'er which two white-thorns their sweet blossoms shed .</l>
     <l n="550">There he sank down , and laid his weary head</l>
     <l n="551">Beside the mossy roots , and in a while</l>
     <l n="552">He slept , and dreamed himself within the isle ;</l>
     <l n="553">That splashing fount the weary sea did seem ,</l>
     <l n="554">And in his dream the fair place but a dream ;</l>
     <l n="555">But when again to feebleness he woke</l>
     <l n="556">Upon his ears that heavenly music broke ,</l>
     <l n="557">Not faint or far as in the isle it was ,</l>
     <l n="558">But e'en as though the minstrels now did pass</l>
     <l n="559">Anigh his resting-place ; then fallen in doubt ,</l>
     <l n="560">E'en as he might , he rose and gazed about ,</l>
     <l n="561">Leaning against the hawthorn stem with pain ;</l>
     <l n="562">And yet his straining gaze was but in vain ,</l>
     <l n="563">Death stole so fast upon him , and no more</l>
     <l n="564">Could he behold the blossoms as before ,</l>
     <l n="565">No more the trees seemed rooted to the ground ,</l>
     <l n="566">A heavy mist seemed gathering all around ,</l>
     <l n="567">And in its heart some bright thing seemed to be ,</l>
     <l n="568">And round his head there breathed deliciously</l>
     <l n="569">Sweet odours , and that music never ceased .</l>
     <l n="570">But as the weight of Death 's strong hand increased</l>
     <l n="571">Again he sank adown , and Courtain 's noise</l>
     <l n="572">Within the scabbard seemed a farewell voice</l>
     <l n="573">Sent from the world he loved so well of old ,</l>
     <l n="574">And all his life was as a story told ,</l>
     <l n="575">And as he thought thereof he ‘ gan to smile</l>
     <l n="576">E'en as a child asleep , but in a while</l>
     <l n="577">It was as though he slept , and sleeping dreamed ,</l>
     <l n="578">For in his half-closed eyes a glory gleamed ,</l>
     <l n="579">As though from some sweet face and golden hair ,</l>
     <l n="580">And on his breast were laid soft hands and fair ,</l>
     <l n="581">And a sweet voice was ringing in his ears ,</l>
     <l n="582">Broken as if with flow of joyous tears ;</l>
     <l n="583">“ Ogier , sweet friend , hast thou not tarried long ?</l>
     <l n="584">Alas ! thine hundred years of strife and wrong ! ”</l>
     <l n="585">Then he found voice to say , “ Alas ! dear Lord ,</l>
     <l n="586">Too long , too long ; and yet one little word</l>

     <l n="588">Then to his face that face was drawn anear ,</l>
     <l n="589">He felt his head raised up and gently laid</l>
     <l n="590">On some kind knee , again the sweet voice said ,</l>

     <l n="603">Yes , I was Ogier once , but if my love</l>

     <l n="655">Within her glorious eyes such wisdom dwelt</l>
     <l n="656">A child before her had the wise man felt ,</l>
     <l n="657">And with the pleasure of a thousand years</l>
     <l n="658">Her lips were fashioned to move joy or tears</l>

     <l n="660">To give at last the kiss unspeakable .</l>
     <l n="661">In such wise was she clad as folk may be ,</l>
     <l n="662">Who , for no shame of their humanity ,</l>
     <l n="663">For no sad changes of the imperfect year ,</l>
     <l n="664">Rather for added beauty , raiment wear ;</l>

     <l n="667">Her raiment veiled her ; where the bands did meet</l>

     <l n="669">Gems gleamed ; a fresh rose-wreath embraced her head ,</l>
     <l n="670">And on her breast there lay a ruby red .</l>
     <l n="671">So with a supplicating look she turned</l>
     <l n="672">To meet the flame that in his own eyes burned ,</l>

     <l n="674">As though to greet him as he drew anigh .</l>

     <l n="756">The very best of well-wrought images</l>

     <l n="760">The hand that in his own hand lay at rest :</l>
     <l n="761">His eyes , grown dull with changing memories ,</l>
     <l n="762">Could make no answer to her glorious eyes :</l>

     <l n="766">He needs must think of what might chance to fall</l>

     <l n="771">Did his desires still turn . But she a while</l>

     <l n="780">As hand in hand through that green place they went ,</l>
     <l n="781">Yet therewithal a strain of tender love</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="783">So through the whispering trees they came at last</l>

     <l n="787">Playing about in carelessness and mirth ,</l>
     <l n="788">Unshadowed by the doubtful deeds of earth ;</l>
     <l n="789">And from the midst a band of fair girls came ,</l>
     <l n="790">With flowers and music , greeting him by name ,</l>
     <l n="791">And praising him ; but ever like a dream</l>
     <l n="792">He could not break , did all to Ogier seem .</l>
     <l n="793">And he his old world did the more desire ,</l>
     <l n="794">For in his heart still burned unquenched the fire ,</l>
     <l n="795">That through the world of old so bright did burn :</l>
     <l n="796">Yet was he fain that kindness to return ,</l>
     <l n="797">And from the depth of his full heart he sighed .</l>
     <l n="798">Then toward the house the lovely Queen did guide</l>
     <l n="799">His listless steps , and seemed to take no thought</l>
     <l n="800">Of knitted brow or wandering eyes distraught ,</l>
     <l n="801">But still with kind love lighting up her face</l>
     <l n="802">She led him through the door of that fair place ,</l>
     <l n="803">While round about them did the damsels press ;</l>
     <l n="804">And he was moved by all that loveliness</l>
     <l n="805">As one might be , who , lying half asleep</l>
     <l n="806">In the May morning , notes the light wind sweep</l>
     <l n="807">Over the tulip-beds : no more to him</l>
     <l n="808">Were gleaming eyes , red lips , and bodies slim ,</l>
     <l n="809">Amidst that dream , although the first surprise</l>
     <l n="810">Of hurried love wherewith the Queen 's sweet eyes</l>
     <l n="811">Had smitten him , still in his heart did stir .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="812">And so at last he came , led on by her</l>
     <l n="813">Into a hall wherein a fair throne was ,</l>
     <l n="814">And hand in hand thereto the twain did pass ;</l>
     <l n="815">And there she bade him sit , and when alone</l>
     <l n="816">He took his place upon the double throne ,</l>
     <l n="817">She cast herself before him on her knees ,</l>
     <l n="818">Embracing his , and greatly did increase</l>
     <l n="819">The shame and love that vexed his troubled heart :</l>
     <l n="820">But now a line of girls the crowd did part ,</l>
     <l n="821">Lovelier than all , and Ogier could behold</l>
     <l n="822">One in their midst who bore a crown of gold</l>
     <l n="823">Within her slender hands and delicate ;</l>
     <l n="824">She , drawing nigh , beside the throne did wait</l>
     <l n="825">Until the Queen arose and took the crown ,</l>
     <l n="826">Who then to Ogier 's lips did stoop adown</l>
     <l n="827">And kissed him , and said , “ Ogier , what were worth</l>
     <l n="828">Thy miserable days of strife on earth ,</l>
     <l n="829">That on their ashes still thine eyes are turned ? ”</l>
     <l n="830">Then , as she spoke these words , his changed heart burned</l>
     <l n="831">With sudden memories , and thereto had he</l>
     <l n="832">Made answer , but she raised up suddenly</l>
     <l n="833">The crown she held and set it on his head ,</l>
     <l n="834">“ Ogier , ” she cried , “ those troublous days are dead ;</l>
     <l n="835">Thou wert dead with them also , but for me ;</l>
     <l n="836">Turn unto her who wrought these things for thee ! ”</l>
     <l n="837">Then , as he felt her touch , a mighty wave</l>
     <l n="838">Of love swept o'er his soul , as though the grave</l>
     <l n="839">Did really hold his body ; from his seat</l>
     <l n="840">He rose to cast himself before her feet ;</l>
     <l n="841">But she clung round him , and in close embrace</l>
     <l n="842">The twain were locked amidst that thronging place .</l>

     <l n="881">When will they come ? or rather is it true</l>

     <l n="883">Upon the marshes of the lower Seine ,</l>
     <l n="884">And that their long-ships , turning back again ,</l>
     <l n="885">Caught by the high-raised waters of the bore</l>
     <l n="886">Were driven here and there and cast ashore ?</l>
     <l n="887">Such questions did they ask , and , as fresh men</l>
     <l n="888">Came hurrying in , they asked them o'er again ,</l>
     <l n="889">And from scared folk , or fools , or ignorant ,</l>
     <l n="890">Still got new lies , or tidings very scant .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="891">But now amidst these men at last came one ,</l>
     <l n="892">A little ere the setting of the sun ,</l>
     <l n="893">With two stout men behind him , armed right well ,</l>
     <l n="894">Who ever as they rode on , sooth to tell ,</l>
     <l n="895">With doubtful eyes upon their master stared ,</l>
     <l n="896">Or looked about like troubled men and scared .</l>
     <l n="897">And he they served was noteworthy indeed ;</l>
     <l n="898">Of ancient fashion were his arms and weed ,</l>
     <l n="899">Rich past the wont of men in those sad times ;</l>
     <l n="900">His face was bronzed , as though by burning climes ,</l>
     <l n="901">But lovely as the image of a god</l>
     <l n="902">Carved in the days before on earth Christ trod ;</l>
     <l n="903">But solemn were his eyes , and grey as glass ,</l>
     <l n="904">And like to ruddy gold his fine hair was :</l>
     <l n="905">A mighty man he was , and taller far</l>
     <l n="906">Than those who on that day must bear the war</l>
     <l n="907">The pagans waged : he by the warders stayed</l>
     <l n="908">Scarce looked on them , but straight their words obeyed</l>
     <l n="909">And showed his pass ; then , asked about his name</l>
     <l n="910">And from what city of the world he came ,</l>
     <l n="911">Said , that men called him now the Ancient Knight ,</l>
     <l n="912">That he was come midst the king 's men to fight</l>
     <l n="913">From St. Omer 's ; and as he spoke , he gazed</l>
     <l n="914">Down on the thronging street as one amazed ,</l>
     <l n="915">And answered no more to the questioning</l>
     <l n="916">Of frightened folk of this or that sad thing ;</l>
     <l n="917">But , ere he passed on , turned about at last</l>
     <l n="918">And on the wondering guard a strange look cast ,</l>
     <l n="919">And said , “ St. Mary ! do such men as ye</l>
     <l n="920">Fight with the wasters from across the sea ?</l>
     <l n="921">Then , certes , are ye lost , however good</l>
     <l n="922">Your hearts may be ; not such were those who stood</l>
     <l n="923">Beside the Hammer-bearer years agone . ”</l>
     <l n="924">So said he , and as his fair armour shone</l>
     <l n="925">With beauty of a time long passed away ,</l>
     <l n="926">So with the music of another day</l>
     <l n="927">His deep voice thrilled the awe-struck , listening folk .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="928">Yet from the crowd a mocking voice outbroke ,</l>
     <l n="929">That cried , “ Be merry , masters , fear ye nought ,</l>
     <l n="930">Surely good succour to our side is brought ;</l>
     <l n="931">For here is Charlemaine come off his tomb</l>
     <l n="932">To save his faithful city from its doom . ”</l>
     <l n="933">“ Yea , ” said another , “ this is certain news ,</l>
     <l n="934">Surely ye know how all the carvers use</l>
     <l n="935">To carve the dead man 's image at the best ,</l>
     <l n="936">That guards the place where he may lie at rest ;</l>
     <l n="937">Wherefore this living image looks indeed ,</l>
     <l n="938">Spite of his ancient tongue and marvellous weed ,</l>
     <l n="939">To have but thirty summers . ”</l>
     <l n="940">At the name</l>
     <l n="941">Of Charlemaine , he turned to whence there came</l>
     <l n="942">The mocking voice , and somewhat knit his brow ,</l>
     <l n="943">And seemed as he would speak , but scarce knew how ;</l>
     <l n="944">So with a half-sigh soon sank back again</l>
     <l n="945">Into his dream , and shook his well-wrought rein ,</l>
     <l n="946">And silently went on upon his way .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="947">And this was Ogier : on what evil day</l>
     <l n="948">Has he then stumbled , that he needs must come ,</l>
     <l n="949">Midst war and ravage , to the ancient home</l>
     <l n="950">Of his desires ? did he grow weary then ,</l>
     <l n="951">And wish to strive once more with foolish men</l>
     <l n="952">For worthless things ? or is fair Avallon</l>
     <l n="953">Sunk in the sea , and all that glory gone ?</l>
     <l n="954">Nay , thus it happed — One day she came to him</l>
     <l n="955">And said , “ Ogier , thy name is waxing dim</l>
     <l n="956">Upon the world that thou rememberest not ;</l>
     <l n="957">The heathen men are thick on many a spot</l>
     <l n="958">Thine eyes have seen , and which I love therefore ;</l>
     <l n="959">And God will give His wonted help no more .</l>
     <l n="960">Wilt thou , then , help ? canst thou have any mind</l>
     <l n="961">To give thy banner once more to the wind ?</l>
     <l n="962">Since greater glory thou shalt win for this</l>
     <l n="963">Than erst thou gatheredst ere thou cam'st to bliss :</l>
     <l n="964">For men are dwindled both in heart and frame ,</l>
     <l n="965">Nor holds the fair land any such a name</l>
     <l n="966">As thine , when thou wert living midst thy peers ;</l>
     <l n="967">The world is worser for these hundred years . ”</l>
     <l n="968">From his calm eyes there gleamed a little fire ,</l>
     <l n="969">And in his voice was something of desire ,</l>
     <l n="970">To see the land where he was used to be ,</l>
     <l n="971">As now he answered : “ Nay , choose thou for me ,</l>
     <l n="972">Thou art the wisest ; it is more than well</l>
     <l n="973">Within this peaceful place with thee to dwell :</l>
     <l n="974">Nor ill perchance in that old land to die ,</l>
     <l n="975">If , dying , I keep not the memory</l>
     <l n="976">Of this fair life of ours . ” “ Nay , nay , ” said she ,</l>
     <l n="977">“ As to thy dying , that shall never be ,</l>
     <l n="978">Whiles that thou keep'st my ring — and now , behold ,</l>
     <l n="979">I take from thee thy charmed crown of gold ,</l>
     <l n="980">And thou wilt be the Ogier that thou wast</l>
     <l n="981">Ere on the loadstone rock thy ship was cast :</l>
     <l n="982">Yet thou shalt have thy youthful body still ,</l>
     <l n="983">And I will guard thy life from every ill . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="984">So was it done , and Ogier , armed right well ,</l>
     <l n="985">Sleeping , was borne away by some strong spell ,</l>
     <l n="986">And set upon the Flemish coast ; and thence</l>
     <l n="987">Turned to St. Omer 's , with a doubtful sense</l>
     <l n="988">Of being in some wild dream , the while he knew</l>
     <l n="989">That great delight forgotten was his due ,</l>
     <l n="990">That all which there might hap was of small worth .</l>
     <l n="991">So on he went , and sometimes unto mirth</l>
     <l n="992">Did his attire move the country-folk ,</l>
     <l n="993">But oftener when strange speeches from him broke</l>
     <l n="994">Concerning men and things for long years dead ,</l>
     <l n="995">He filled the listeners with great awe and dread ;</l>
     <l n="996">For in such wild times as these people were</l>
     <l n="997">Are men soon moved to wonder and to fear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="998">Now through the streets of Paris did he ride ,</l>
     <l n="999">And at a certain hostel did abide</l>
     <l n="1000">Throughout that night , and ere he went next day</l>
     <l n="1001">He saw a book that on a table lay ,</l>
     <l n="1002">And opening it ‘ gan read in lazy mood :</l>
     <l n="1003">But long before it in that place he stood ,</l>
     <l n="1004">Noting nought else ; for it did chronicle</l>
     <l n="1005">The deeds of men whom once he knew right well ,</l>
     <l n="1006">When they were living in the flesh with him :</l>
     <l n="1007">Yea , his own deeds he saw , grown strange and dim</l>
     <l n="1008">Already , and true stories mixed with lies ,</l>
     <l n="1009">Until , with many thronging memories</l>
     <l n="1010">Of those old days , his heart was so oppressed ,</l>
     <l n="1011">He ‘ gan to wish that he might lie at rest ,</l>
     <l n="1012">Forgetting all things : for indeed by this</l>
     <l n="1013">Little remembrance had he of the bliss</l>
     <l n="1014">That wrapped his soul in peaceful Avallon .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="1015">But his changed life he needs must carry on ;</l>
     <l n="1016">For ye shall know the Queen was gathering men</l>
     <l n="1017">To send unto the good King , who as then</l>
     <l n="1018">In Rouen lay , beset by many a band</l>
     <l n="1019">Of those who carried terror through the land ,</l>
     <l n="1020">And still by messengers for help he prayed :</l>
     <l n="1021">Therefore a mighty muster was being made ,</l>
     <l n="1022">Of weak and strong , and brave and timorous ,</l>
     <l n="1023">Before the Queen anigh her royal house .</l>
     <l n="1024">So thither on this morn did Ogier turn ,</l>
     <l n="1025">Some certain news about the war to learn ;</l>
     <l n="1026">And when he came at last into the square ,</l>
     <l n="1027">And saw the ancient palace great and fair</l>
     <l n="1028">Rise up before him as in other days ,</l>
     <l n="1029">And in the merry morn the bright sun 's rays</l>
     <l n="1030">Glittering on gathered helms and moving spears ,</l>
     <l n="1031">He ‘ gan to feel as in the long-past years ,</l>
     <l n="1032">And his heart stirred within him . Now the Queen</l>
     <l n="1033">Came from within , right royally beseen ,</l>
     <l n="1034">And took her seat beneath a canopy ,</l>
     <l n="1035">With lords and captains of the war anigh ;</l>
     <l n="1036">And as she came a mighty shout arose ,</l>
     <l n="1037">And round about began the knights to close ,</l>
     <l n="1038">Their oath of fealty to swear anew ,</l>
     <l n="1039">And learn what service they had got to do .</l>
     <l n="1040">But so it was , that some their shouts must stay</l>
     <l n="1041">To gaze at Ogier as he took his way</l>
     <l n="1042">Through the thronged place ; and quickly too he gat</l>
     <l n="1043">Unto the place whereas the Lady sat ,</l>
     <l n="1044">For men gave place unto him , fearing him :</l>
     <l n="1045">For not alone was he most huge of limb ,</l>
     <l n="1046">And dangerous , but something in his face ,</l>
     <l n="1047">As his calm eyes looked o'er the crowded place ,</l>
     <l n="1048">Struck men with awe ; and in the ancient days ,</l>
     <l n="1049">When men might hope alive on gods to gaze ,</l>
     <l n="1050">They would have thought , “ The gods yet love our town</l>
     <l n="1051">And from the heavens have sent a great one down . ”</l>
     <l n="1052">Withal unto the throne he came so near ,</l>
     <l n="1053">That he the Queen 's sweet measured voice could hear ;</l>
     <l n="1054">And swiftly now within him wrought the change</l>
     <l n="1055">That first he felt amid those faces strange ;</l>
     <l n="1056">And his heart burned to taste the hurrying life</l>
     <l n="1057">With such desires , such changing sweetness rife .</l>
     <l n="1058">And yet , indeed , how should he live alone ,</l>
     <l n="1059">Who in the old past days such friends had known ?</l>
     <l n="1060">Then he began to think of Caraheu ,</l>
     <l n="1061">Of Bellicent the fair , and once more knew</l>
     <l n="1062">The bitter pain of rent and ended love .</l>
     <l n="1063">But while with hope and vain regret he strove ,</l>
     <l n="1064">He found none ‘ twixt him and the Queen 's high seat ,</l>
     <l n="1065">And , stepping forth , he knelt before her feet</l>
     <l n="1066">And took her hand to swear , as was the way</l>
     <l n="1067">Of doing fealty in that ancient day ,</l>
     <l n="1068">And raised his eyes to hers ; as fair was she</l>
     <l n="1069">As any woman of the world might be</l>
     <l n="1070">Full-limbed and tall , dark-haired , from her deep eyes ,</l>
     <l n="1071">The snare of fools , the ruin of the wise ,</l>
     <l n="1072">Love looked unchecked ; and now her dainty hand ,</l>
     <l n="1073">The well-knit holder of the golden wand ,</l>
     <l n="1074">Trembled in his , she cast her eyes adown ,</l>
     <l n="1075">And her sweet brow was knitted to a frown ,</l>
     <l n="1076">As he , the taker of such oaths of yore ,</l>
     <l n="1077">Now unto her all due obedience swore ,</l>
     <l n="1078">Yet gave himself no name ; and now the Queen ,</l>
     <l n="1079">Awed by his voice as other folk had been ,</l>
     <l n="1080">Yet felt a trembling hope within her rise</l>
     <l n="1081">Too sweet to think of , and with love 's surprise</l>
     <l n="1082">Her cheek grew pale ; she said , “ Thy style and name</l>
     <l n="1083">Thou tellest not , nor what land of thy fame</l>
     <l n="1084">Is glad ; for , certes , some land must be glad ,</l>
     <l n="1085">That in its bounds her house thy mother had . ”</l>
     <l n="1086">“ Lady , ” he said , “ from what far land I come</l>
     <l n="1087">I well might tell thee , but another home</l>
     <l n="1088">Have I long dwelt in , and its name have I</l>
     <l n="1089">Forgotten now , forgotten utterly</l>
     <l n="1090">Who were my fellows , and what deeds they did ;</l>
     <l n="1091">Therefore , indeed , shall my first name be hid</l>
     <l n="1092">And my first country ; call me on this day</l>
     <l n="1093">The Ancient Knight , and let me go my way . ”</l>
     <l n="1094">He rose withal , for she her fingers fair</l>
     <l n="1095">Had drawn aback , and on him ‘ gan to stare</l>
     <l n="1096">As one afeard ; for something terrible</l>
     <l n="1097">Was in his speech , and that she knew right well ,</l>
     <l n="1098">Who ‘ gan to love him , and to fear that she ,</l>
     <l n="1099">Shut out by some strange deadly mystery ,</l>
     <l n="1100">Should never gain from him an equal love ;</l>
     <l n="1101">Yet , as from her high seat he ‘ gan to move ,</l>
     <l n="1102">She said , “ O Ancient Knight , come presently ,</l>
     <l n="1103">When we have done this muster , unto me ,</l>
     <l n="1104">And thou shalt have thy charge and due command</l>
     <l n="1105">For freeing from our foes this wretched land ! ”</l>
     <l n="1106">Then Ogier made his reverence and went ,</l>
     <l n="1107">And somewhat could perceive of her intent ;</l>
     <l n="1108">For in his heart life grew , and love with life</l>
     <l n="1109">Grew , and therewith , ‘ twixt love and fame , was strife .</l>
     <l n="1110">But , as he slowly gat him from the square ,</l>
     <l n="1111">Gazing at all the people gathered there ,</l>
     <l n="1112">A squire of the Queen 's behind him came ,</l>
     <l n="1113">And breathless , called him by his new-coined name ,</l>
     <l n="1114">And bade him turn because the Queen now bade ,</l>
     <l n="1115">Since by the muster long she might be stayed ,</l>
     <l n="1116">That to the palace he should bring him straight ,</l>
     <l n="1117">Midst sport and play her coming back to wait ;</l>
     <l n="1118">Then Ogier turned , nought loath , and with him went ,</l>
     <l n="1119">And to a postern-gate his steps he bent ,</l>
     <l n="1120">That Ogier knew right well in days of old ;</l>
     <l n="1121">Worn was it now , and the bright hues and gold</l>
     <l n="1122">Upon the shields above , with lapse of days ,</l>
     <l n="1123">Were faded much : but now did Ogier gaze</l>
     <l n="1124">Upon the garden where he walked of yore ,</l>
     <l n="1125">Holding the hands that he should see no more ;</l>
     <l n="1126">For all was changed except the palace fair ,</l>
     <l n="1127">That Charlemaine 's own eyes had seen built there</l>
     <l n="1128">Ere Ogier knew him ; there the squire did lead</l>
     <l n="1129">The Ancient Knight , who still took little heed</l>
     <l n="1130">Of all the things that by the way he said ,</l>
     <l n="1131">For all his thoughts were on the days long dead .</l>
     <l n="1132">There in the painted hall he sat again ,</l>
     <l n="1133">And ‘ neath the pictured eyes of Charlemaine</l>
     <l n="1134">He ate and drank , and felt it like a dream ;</l>
     <l n="1135">And midst his growing longings yet might deem</l>
     <l n="1136">That he from sleep should wake up presently</l>
     <l n="1137">In some fair city on the Syrian sea ,</l>
     <l n="1138">Or on the brown rocks of the loadstone isle .</l>
     <l n="1139">But fain to be alone , within a while</l>
     <l n="1140">He gat him to the garden , and there passed</l>
     <l n="1141">By wondering squires and damsels , till at last ,</l>
     <l n="1142">Far from the merry folk who needs must play ,</l>
     <l n="1143">If on the world were coming its last day ,</l>
     <l n="1144">He sat him down , and through his mind there ran</l>
     <l n="1145">Faint thoughts of that day , when , outworn and wan ,</l>
     <l n="1146">He lay down by the fountain-side to die .</l>
     <l n="1147">But when he strove to gain clear memory</l>
     <l n="1148">Of what had happed since on the isle he lay</l>
     <l n="1149">Waiting for death , a hopeless castaway ,</l>
     <l n="1150">Thought , failing him , would rather bring again</l>
     <l n="1151">His life among the peers of Charlemaine ,</l>
     <l n="1152">And vex his soul with hapless memories ;</l>
     <l n="1153">Until at last , worn out by thought of these ,</l>
     <l n="1154">And hopeless striving to find what was true ,</l>
     <l n="1155">And pondering on the deeds he had to do</l>
     <l n="1156">Ere he returned , whereto he could not tell ,</l>
     <l n="1157">Sweet sleep upon his wearied spirit fell .</l>
     <l n="1158">And on the afternoon of that fair day ,</l>
     <l n="1159">Forgetting all , beneath the trees he lay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="1160">Meanwhile the Queen , affairs of state being done ,</l>
     <l n="1161">Went through the gardens with one dame alone</l>
     <l n="1162">Seeking for Ogier , whom at last she found</l>
     <l n="1163">Laid sleeping on the daisy-sprinkled ground .</l>
     <l n="1164">Dreaming , I know not what , of other days .</l>
     <l n="1165">Then on him for a while the Queen did gaze ,</l>
     <l n="1166">Drawing sweet poison from the lovely sight ,</l>
     <l n="1167">Then to her fellow turned , “ The Ancient Knight —</l>
     <l n="1168">What means he by this word of his ? ” she said ;</l>
     <l n="1169">“ He were well mated with some lovely maid</l>
     <l n="1170">Just pondering on the late-heard name of love . ”</l>
     <l n="1171">“ Softly , my lady , he begins to move , ”</l>
     <l n="1172">Her fellow said , a woman old and grey ;</l>
     <l n="1173">“ Look now , his arms are of another day ;</l>
     <l n="1174">None know him or his deeds ; thy squire just said</l>
     <l n="1175">He asked about the state of men long dead ;</l>
     <l n="1176">I fear what he may be ; look , seest thou not</l>
     <l n="1177">That ring that on one finger he has got ,</l>
     <l n="1178">Where figures strange upon the gold are wrought :</l>
     <l n="1179">God grant that he from hell has not been brought</l>
     <l n="1180">For our confusion , in this doleful war ,</l>
     <l n="1181">Who surely in enough of trouble are</l>
     <l n="1182">Without such help ; ” then the Queen turned aside</l>
     <l n="1183">Awhile , her drawn and troubled face to hide ,</l>
     <l n="1184">For lurking dread this speech within her stirred ;</l>
     <l n="1185">But yet she said , “ Thou sayest a foolish word ,</l>
     <l n="1186">This man is come against our enemies</l>
     <l n="1187">To fight for us . ” Then down upon her knees</l>
     <l n="1188">Fell the old woman by the sleeping knight ,</l>
     <l n="1189">And from his hand she drew with fingers light</l>
     <l n="1190">The wondrous ring , and scarce again could rise</l>
     <l n="1191">Ere ‘ neath the trembling Queen 's bewildered eyes</l>
     <l n="1192">The change began ; his golden hair turned white ,</l>
     <l n="1193">His smooth cheek wrinkled , and his breathing light</l>
     <l n="1194">Was turned to troublous struggling for his breath ,</l>
     <l n="1195">And on his shrunk lips lay the hand of death ;</l>
     <l n="1196">And , scarce less pale than he , the trembling Queen</l>
     <l n="1197">Stood thinking on the beauty she had seen</l>
     <l n="1198">And longed for , but a little while ago ,</l>
     <l n="1199">Yet with her terror still her love did grow ,</l>
     <l n="1200">And she began to weep as though she saw</l>
     <l n="1201">Her beauty e'en to such an ending draw .</l>
     <l n="1202">And ‘ neath her tears waking he oped his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="1203">And strove to speak , but nought but gasping sighs</l>
     <l n="1204">His lips could utter ; then he tried to reach</l>
     <l n="1205">His hand to them , as though he would beseech</l>
     <l n="1206">The gift of what was his : but all the while</l>
     <l n="1207">The crone gazed on them with an evil smile ,</l>
     <l n="1208">Then holding toward the Queen that wondrous ring ,</l>
     <l n="1209">She said , “ Why weep'st thou ? having this fair thing ,</l>
     <l n="1210">Thou , losing nought the beauty that thou hast ,</l>
     <l n="1211">May'st watch the vainly struggling world go past ,</l>
     <l n="1212">Thyself unchanged . ” The Queen put forth her hand</l>
     <l n="1213">And took the ring , and there awhile did stand</l>
     <l n="1214">And strove to think of it , but still in her</l>
     <l n="1215">Such all-absorbing longings love did stir ,</l>
     <l n="1216">So young she was , of death she could not think ,</l>
     <l n="1217">Or what a cup eld gives to man to drink ;</l>
     <l n="1218">Yet on her finger had she set the ring</l>
     <l n="1219">When now the life that hitherto did cling</l>
     <l n="1220">To Ogier 's heart seemed fading quite away ,</l>
     <l n="1221">And scarcely breathing with shut eyes he lay .</l>
     <l n="1222">Then , kneeling down , she murmured piteously ,</l>
     <l n="1223">“ Ah , wilt thou love me if I give it thee ,</l>
     <l n="1224">And thou grow'st young again ? what should I do</l>
     <l n="1225">If with the eyes thou thus shalt gain anew</l>
     <l n="1226">Thou shouldst look scorn on me ? ” But with that word</l>
     <l n="1227">The hedge behind her , by the west wind stirred ,</l>
     <l n="1228">Cast fear into her heart of some one nigh ,</l>
     <l n="1229">And therewith on his finger hastily</l>
     <l n="1230">She set the ring , then rose and stood apart</l>
     <l n="1231">A little way , and in her doubtful heart</l>
     <l n="1232">With love and fear was mixed desire of life .</l>
     <l n="1233">But standing so , a look with great scorn rife</l>
     <l n="1234">The elder woman , turning , cast on her ,</l>
     <l n="1235">Pointing to Ogier , who began to stir ;</l>
     <l n="1236">She looked , and all she erst saw now did seem</l>
     <l n="1237">To have been nothing but a hideous dream ,</l>
     <l n="1238">As fair and young he rose from off the ground</l>
     <l n="1239">And cast a dazed and puzzled look around ,</l>
     <l n="1240">Like one just waked from sleep in some strange place ;</l>
     <l n="1241">But soon his grave eyes rested on her face ,</l>
     <l n="1242">And turned yet graver seeing her so pale ,</l>
     <l n="1243">And that her eyes were pregnant with some tale</l>
     <l n="1244">Of love and fear ; she ‘ neath his eyes the while</l>
     <l n="1245">Forced her pale lips to semblance of a smile ,</l>
     <l n="1246">And said , “ O Ancient Knight , thou sleepest then ?</l>
     <l n="1247">While through this poor land range the heathen men</l>
     <l n="1248">Unmet of any but my King and Lord :</l>
     <l n="1249">Nay , let us see the deeds of thine old sword . ”</l>
     <l n="1250">“ Queen , ” said he , “ bid me then unto this work ,</l>
     <l n="1251">And certes I behind no wall would lurk ,</l>
     <l n="1252">Nor send for succour , while a scanty folk</l>
     <l n="1253">Still followed after me to break the yoke :</l>
     <l n="1254">I pray thee grace for sleeping , and were fain</l>
     <l n="1255">That I might rather never sleep again</l>
     <l n="1256">Then have such wretched dreams as I e'en now</l>
     <l n="1257">Have waked from . ”</l>
     <l n="1258">Lovelier she seemed to grow</l>
     <l n="1259">Unto him as he spoke ; fresh colour came</l>
     <l n="1260">Into her face , as though for some sweet shame ,</l>
     <l n="1261">While she with tearful eyes beheld him so ,</l>
     <l n="1262">That somewhat even must his burnt cheek glow ,</l>
     <l n="1263">His heart beat faster . But again she said ,</l>
     <l n="1264">“ Nay , will dreams burden such a mighty head ?</l>
     <l n="1265">Then may I too have pardon for a dream :</l>
     <l n="1266">Last night in sleep I saw thee , who didst seem</l>
     <l n="1267">To be the King of France ; and thou and I</l>
     <l n="1268">Were sitting at some great festivity</l>
     <l n="1269">Within the many-peopled gold-hung place . ”</l>
     <l n="1270">The blush of shame was gone as on his face</l>
     <l n="1271">She gazed , and saw him read her meaning clear</l>
     <l n="1272">And knew that no cold words she had to fear ,</l>
     <l n="1273">But rather that for softer speech he yearned .</l>
     <l n="1274">Therefore , with love alone her smooth cheek burned ;</l>
     <l n="1275">Her parted lips were hungry for his kiss ,</l>
     <l n="1276">She trembled at the near approaching bliss ;</l>
     <l n="1277">Nathless , she checked her love a little while ,</l>
     <l n="1278">Because she felt the old dame 's curious smile</l>
     <l n="1279">Upon her , and she said , “ O Ancient Knight ,</l>
     <l n="1280">If I then read my last night 's dream aright ,</l>
     <l n="1281">Thou art come here our very help to be ,</l>
     <l n="1282">Perchance to give my husband back to me ;</l>
     <l n="1283">Come then , if thou this land art fain to save ,</l>
     <l n="1284">And show the wisdom thou must surely have</l>
     <l n="1285">Unto my council ; I will give thee then</l>
     <l n="1286">What charge I may among my valiant men ;</l>
     <l n="1287">And certes thou wilt do so well herein ,</l>
     <l n="1288">That , ere long , something greater shalt thou win :</l>
     <l n="1289">Come , then , deliverer of my throne and land ,</l>
     <l n="1290">And let me touch for once thy mighty hand</l>
     <l n="1291">With these weak fingers . ”</l>
     <l n="1292">As she spoke , she met</l>
     <l n="1293">His eager hand , and all things did forget</l>
     <l n="1294">But for one moment , for too wise were they</l>
     <l n="1295">To cast the coming years of joy away ;</l>
     <l n="1296">Then with her other hand her gown she raised</l>
     <l n="1297">And led him thence , and o'er her shoulder gazed</l>
     <l n="1298">At her old follower with a doubtful smile ,</l>
     <l n="1299">As though to say , “ Be wise , I know thy guile ! ”</l>
     <l n="1300">But slowly she behind the lovers walked ,</l>
     <l n="1301">Muttering , “ So be it ! thou shalt not be balked</l>
     <l n="1302">Of thy desire ; be merry ! I am wise ,</l>
     <l n="1303">Nor will I rob thee of thy Paradise</l>
     <l n="1304">For any other than myself ; and thou</l>
     <l n="1305">May'st even happen to have had enow</l>
     <l n="1306">Of this new love , before I get the ring ,</l>
     <l n="1307">And I may work for thee no evil thing . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="33">
     <l n="1308">Now ye shall know that the old chronicle ,</l>
     <l n="1309">Wherein I read all this , doth duly tell</l>
     <l n="1310">Of all the gallant deeds that Ogier did ,</l>
     <l n="1311">There may ye read them ; nor let me be chid</l>
     <l n="1312">If I therefore say little of these things ,</l>
     <l n="1313">Because the thought of Avallon still clings</l>
     <l n="1314">Unto my heart , and scarcely can I bear</l>

     <l n="1316">Through which , with dulled and glimmering memory ,</l>
     <l n="1317">Ogier was grown content to live and die</l>
     <l n="1318">Like other men ; but this I have to say ,</l>
     <l n="1319">That in the council chamber on that day</l>
     <l n="1320">The Old Knight showed his wisdom well enow ,</l>
     <l n="1321">While fainter still with love the Queen did grow</l>
     <l n="1322">Hearing his words , beholding his grey eyes</l>
     <l n="1323">Flashing with fire of warlike memories ;</l>
     <l n="1324">Yea , at the last he seemed so wise indeed</l>
     <l n="1325">That she could give him now the charge , to lead</l>
     <l n="1326">One wing of the great army that set out</l>
     <l n="1327">From Paris ’ gates , midst many a wavering shout ,</l>
     <l n="1328">Midst trembling prayers , and unchecked wails and tears ,</l>
     <l n="1329">And slender hopes and unresisted fears .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="34">
     <l n="1330">Now ere he went , upon his bed he lay ,</l>
     <l n="1331">Newly awakened at the dawn of day ,</l>
     <l n="1332">Gathering perplexéd thoughts of many a thing ,</l>
     <l n="1333">When , midst the carol that the birds did sing</l>
     <l n="1334">Unto the coming of the hopeful sun ,</l>
     <l n="1335">He heard a sudden lovesome song begun</l>
     <l n="1336">‘ Twixt two young voices in the garden green ,</l>
     <l n="1337">That seemed indeed the farewell of the Queen .</l>

     <l n="19">There at a window was she waiting them</l>
     <l n="20">In fair attire with gold in every hem ,</l>
     <l n="21">And as the Ancient Knight beneath her passed</l>
     <l n="22">A wreath of flowering white-thorn down she cast ,</l>
     <l n="23">And looked farewell to him , and forth he set</l>
     <l n="24">Thinking of all the pleasure he should get</l>
     <l n="25">From love and war , forgetting Avallon</l>
     <l n="26">And all that lovely life so lightly won ;</l>
     <l n="27">Yea , now indeed the earthly life o'erpast</l>
     <l n="28">Ere on the loadstone rock his ship was cast</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="35">Now I , though writing here no chronicle</l>
     <l n="36">E'en as I said , must nathless shortly tell</l>
     <l n="37">That , ere the army Rouen 's gates could gain</l>
     <l n="38">By a broad arrow had the King been slain ,</l>
     <l n="39">And helpless now the wretched country lay</l>
     <l n="40">Beneath the yoke , until the glorious day</l>
     <l n="41">When Ogier fell at last upon the foe ,</l>
     <l n="42">And scattered them as helplessly as though</l>
     <l n="43">They had been beaten men without a name :</l>
     <l n="44">So when to Paris town once more he came</l>
     <l n="45">Few folk the memory of the King did keep</l>
     <l n="46">Within their hearts , and if the folk did weep</l>
     <l n="47">At his returning , ‘ twas for joy indeed</l>
     <l n="48">That such a man had risen at their need</l>
     <l n="49">To work for them so great deliverance ,</l>
     <l n="50">And loud they called on him for King of France .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="51">But if the Queen 's heart were the more a-flame</l>
     <l n="52">For all that she had heard of his great fame ,</l>
     <l n="53">I know not ; rather with some hidden dread</l>
     <l n="54">Of coming fate , she heard her lord was dead ,</l>
     <l n="55">And her false dream seemed coming true at last ,</l>
     <l n="56">For the clear sky of love seemed overcast</l>
     <l n="57">With clouds of God 's great judgments , and the fear</l>
     <l n="58">Of hate and final parting drawing near .</l>
     <l n="59">So now when he before her throne did stand</l>
     <l n="60">Amidst the throng as saviour of the land ,</l>
     <l n="61">And she her eyes to his kind eyes did raise ,</l>
     <l n="62">And there before all her own love must praise ;</l>
     <l n="63">Then did she fall a-weeping , and folk said ,</l>
     <l n="64">“ See , how she sorrows for the newly dead !</l>
     <l n="65">Amidst our joy she needs must think of him ;</l>
     <l n="66">Let be , full surely shall her grief wax dim</l>
     <l n="67">And she shall wed again . ”</l>
     <l n="68">So passed the year ,</l>
     <l n="69">While Ogier set himself the land to clear</l>
     <l n="70">Of broken remnants of the heathen men ,</l>
     <l n="71">And at the last , when May-time came again ,</l>
     <l n="72">Must he be crowned King of the twice-saved land ,</l>
     <l n="73">And at the altar take the fair Queen 's hand</l>
     <l n="74">And wed her for his own . And now by this</l>
     <l n="75">Had he forgotten clean the woe and bliss</l>
     <l n="76">Of his old life , and still was he made glad</l>
     <l n="77">As other men ; and hopes and fears he had</l>
     <l n="78">As others , and bethought him not at all</l>
     <l n="79">Of what strange days upon him yet should fall</l>
     <l n="80">When he should live and these again be dead .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="81">Now drew the time round when he should be wed ,</l>
     <l n="82">And in his palace on his bed he lay</l>
     <l n="83">Upon the dawning of the very day :</l>
     <l n="84">‘ Twixt sleep and waking was he , and could hear</l>
     <l n="85">E'en at that hour , through the bright morn and clear ,</l>
     <l n="86">The hammering of the folk who toiled to make</l>
     <l n="87">Some well-wrought stages for the pageant 's sake ,</l>
     <l n="88">Though hardly yet the sparrows had begun</l>
     <l n="89">To twitter o'er the coming of the sun ,</l>
     <l n="90">Nor through the palace did a creature move .</l>
     <l n="91">There in the sweet entanglement of love</l>
     <l n="92">Midst languid thoughts of greater bliss he lay ,</l>
     <l n="93">Remembering no more of that other day</l>
     <l n="94">Than the hot noon remembereth of the night ,</l>
     <l n="95">Than summer thinketh of the winter white .</l>
     <l n="96">In that sweet hour he heard a voice that cried ,</l>
     <l n="97">“ Ogier , Ogier ! ” then , opening his eyes wide ,</l>
     <l n="98">And rising on his elbow , gazed around ,</l>
     <l n="99">And strange to him and empty was the sound</l>
     <l n="100">Of his own name ; “ Whom callest thou ? ” he said</l>
     <l n="101">“ For I , the man who lie upon this bed ,</l>
     <l n="102">Am Charles of France , and shall be King to-day ,</l>
     <l n="103">But in a year that now is passed away</l>
     <l n="104">The Ancient Knight they called me : who is this ,</l>
     <l n="105">Thou callest Ogier , then , what deeds are his ?</l>
     <l n="106">And who art thou ? ” But at that word a sigh ,</l>
     <l n="107">As of one grieved , came from some place anigh</l>
     <l n="108">His bed-side , and a soft voice spake again ,</l>
     <l n="109">“ This Ogier once was great amongst great men ;</l>
     <l n="110">To Italy a helpless hostage led ;</l>
     <l n="111">He saved the King when the false Lombard fled ,</l>
     <l n="112">Bore forth the Oriflamme and gained the day ;</l>
     <l n="113">Charlot he brought back , whom men led away ,</l>
     <l n="114">And fought a day-long fight with Caraheu .</l>
     <l n="115">The ravager of Rome his right hand slew ;</l>
     <l n="116">Nor did he fear the might of Charlemaine ,</l>
     <l n="117">Who for a dreary year beset in vain</l>
     <l n="118">His lonely castle ; yet at last caught then ,</l>
     <l n="119">And shut in hold , needs must he come again</l>
     <l n="120">To give an unhoped great deliverance</l>
     <l n="121">Unto the burdened helpless land of France :</l>
     <l n="122">Denmark he gained thereafter , and he wore</l>
     <l n="123">The crown of England drawn from trouble sore ;</l>
     <l n="124">At Tyre then he reigned , and Babylon</l>
     <l n="125">With mighty deeds he from the foemen won ;</l>
     <l n="126">And when scarce aught could give him greater fame ,</l>
     <l n="127">He left the world still thinking on his name .</l>
     <l n="128">“ These things did Ogier , and these things didst thou ,</l>
     <l n="129">Nor will I call thee by a new name now</l>
     <l n="130">Since I have spoken words of love to thee —</l>
     <l n="131">Ogier , Ogier , dost thou remember me ,</l>
     <l n="132">E'en if thou hast no thought of that past time</l>
     <l n="133">Before thou camest to our happy clime ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="134">As this was said , his mazed eyes saw indeed</l>
     <l n="135">A lovely woman clad in dainty weed</l>
     <l n="136">Beside his bed , and many a thought was stirred</l>
     <l n="137">Within his heart by that last plaintive word ,</l>
     <l n="138">Though nought he said , but waited what should come</l>
     <l n="139">“ Love , ” said she , “ I am here to bring thee home ;</l>
     <l n="140">Well hast thou done all that thou cam'st to do ,</l>
     <l n="141">And if thou bidest here , for something new</l>
     <l n="142">Will folk begin to cry , and all thy fame</l>
     <l n="143">Shall then avail thee but for greater blame ;</l>
     <l n="144">Thy love shall cease to love thee , and the earth</l>
     <l n="145">Thou lovest now shall be of little worth</l>
     <l n="146">While still thou keepest life , abhorring it</l>
     <l n="147">Behold , in men 's lives that so quickly flit</l>
     <l n="148">Thus is it , how then shall it be with thee ,</l>
     <l n="149">Who some faint image of eternity</l>
     <l n="150">Hast gained through me ?— alas , thou heedest not !</l>
     <l n="151">On all these changing things thine heart is hot —</l>
     <l n="152">Take then this gift that I have brought from far ,</l>
     <l n="153">And then may'st thou remember what we are ;</l>
     <l n="154">The lover and the loved from long ago . ”</l>
     <l n="155">He trembled , and more memory seemed to grow</l>
     <l n="156">Within his heart as he beheld her stand ,</l>
     <l n="157">Holding a glittering crown in her right hand :</l>
     <l n="158">“ Ogier , ” she said , “ arise and do on thee</l>
     <l n="159">The emblems of thy worldly sovereignty ,</l>
     <l n="160">For we must pass o'er many a sea this morn . ”</l>
     <l n="161">He rose , and in the glittering tunic worn</l>
     <l n="162">By Charlemaine he clad himself , and took</l>
     <l n="163">The ivory hand , that Charlemaine once shook</l>
     <l n="164">Over the people 's heads in days of old ;</l>
     <l n="165">Then on his feet he set the shoes of gold .</l>
     <l n="166">And o'er his shoulders threw the mantle fair ,</l>
     <l n="167">And set the gold crown on his golden hair :</l>
     <l n="168">Then on the royal chair he sat him down ,</l>
     <l n="169">As though he deemed the elders of the town</l>
     <l n="170">Should come to audience ; and in all he seemed</l>
     <l n="171">To do these things e'en as a man who dreamed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="172">And now adown the Seine the golden sun</l>
     <l n="173">Shone out , as toward him drew that lovely one</l>
     <l n="174">And took from off his head the royal crown ,</l>
     <l n="175">And , smiling , on the pillow laid it down</l>
     <l n="176">And said , “ Lie there , O crown of Charlemaine ,</l>
     <l n="177">Worn by a mighty man , and worn in vain ,</l>
     <l n="178">Because he died , and all the things he did</l>
     <l n="179">Were changed before his face by earth was hid ;</l>
     <l n="180">A better crown I have for my love 's head ,</l>
     <l n="181">Whereby he yet shall live , when all are dead</l>
     <l n="182">His hand has helped . ” Then on his head she set</l>
     <l n="183">The wondrous crown , and said , “ Forget , forget !</l>
     <l n="184">Forget these weary things , for thou hast much</l>
     <l n="185">Of happiness to think of . ”</l>
     <l n="186">At that touch</l>
     <l n="187">He rose , a happy light gleamed in his eyes ;</l>
     <l n="188">And smitten by the rush of memories ,</l>
     <l n="189">He stammered out , “ O love ! how came we here ?</l>
     <l n="190">What do we in this land of Death and Fear ?</l>
     <l n="191">Have I not been from thee a weary while ?</l>
     <l n="192">Let us return — I dreamed about the isle ;</l>
     <l n="193">I dreamed of other years of strife and pain ,</l>
     <l n="194">Of new years full of struggles long and vain . ”</l>
     <l n="195">She took him by the hand and said , “ Come , love ,</l>
     <l n="196">I am not changed ; ” and therewith did they move</l>
     <l n="197">Unto the door , and through the sleeping place</l>
     <l n="198">Swiftly they went , and still was Ogier 's face</l>
     <l n="199">Turned on her beauty , and no thought was his</l>
     <l n="200">Except the dear returning of his bliss .</l>
     <l n="201">But at the threshold of the palace-gate</l>
     <l n="202">That opened to them , she awhile did wait ,</l>
     <l n="203">And turned her eyes unto the rippling Seine</l>
     <l n="204">And said , “ O love , behold it once again ! ”</l>
     <l n="205">He turned , and gazed upon the city grey</l>
     <l n="206">Smit by the gold of that sweet morn of May ;</l>
     <l n="207">He heard faint noises as of wakening folk</l>
     <l n="208">As on their heads his day of glory broke ;</l>
     <l n="209">He heard the changing rush of the swift stream</l>
     <l n="210">Against the bridge-piers . All was grown a dream</l>
     <l n="211">His work was over , his reward was come ,</l>
     <l n="212">Why should he loiter longer from his home ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="213">A little while she watched him silently ,</l>
     <l n="214">Then beckoned him to follow with a sigh ,</l>
     <l n="215">And , raising up the raiment from her feet ,</l>
     <l n="216">Across the threshold stepped into the street ;</l>
     <l n="217">One moment on the twain the low sun shone ,</l>
     <l n="218">And then the place was void , and they were gone</l>
     <l n="219">How I know not ; but this I know indeed ,</l>
     <l n="220">That in whatso great trouble or sore need</l>
     <l n="221">The land of France since that fair day has been ,</l>
     <l n="222">No more the sword of Ogier has she seen .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="223">Such was the tale he told of Avallon .</l>
     <l n="224">E'en such an one as in days past had won</l>
     <l n="225">His youthful heart to think upon the quest ;</l>
     <l n="226">But to those old hearts nigh in reach of rest ,</l>
     <l n="227">Not much to be desired now it seemed —</l>
     <l n="228">Perchance the heart that of such things had dreamed</l>
     <l n="229">Had found no words in this death-laden tongue</l>
     <l n="230">We speak on earth , wherewith they might be sung ;</l>
     <l n="231">Perchance the changing years that changed his heart</l>
     <l n="232">E'en in the words of that old tale had part ,</l>
     <l n="233">Changing its sweet to bitter , to despair</l>
     <l n="234">The foolish hope that once had glittered there —</l>
     <l n="235">Or think , that in some bay of that far home</l>
     <l n="236">They then had sat , and watched the green waves come</l>
     <l n="237">Up to their feet with many promises ;</l>
     <l n="238">Or the light wind midst blossom-laden trees ,</l>
     <l n="239">In the sweet Spring had weighted many a word</l>
     <l n="240">Of no worth now , and many a hope had stirred</l>
     <l n="241">Long dead for ever .</l>
     <l n="242">Howsoe'er that be</l>
     <l n="243">Among strange folk they now sat quietly ,</l>
     <l n="244">As though that tale with them had nought to do ,</l>
     <l n="245">As though its hopes and fears were something new</l>
     <l n="246">But though , indeed , the outworn , dwindled band</l>
     <l n="247">Had no tears left for that once longed-for land ,</l>
     <l n="248">The very wind must moan for their decay ,</l>
     <l n="249">And from the sky , grown dull , and low , and grey ,</l>
     <l n="250">Cold tears must fall upon the lonely field ,</l>
     <l n="251">That such fair golden hopes erewhile did yield ;</l>
     <l n="252">And on the blackening woods , wherein the doves</l>
     <l n="253">Sat silent now , forgetful of their loves .</l>
     <l n="254">Yet , since a little life at least was left ,</l>
     <l n="255">They were not yet of every joy bereft ,</l>
     <l n="256">For long ago was past the agony ,</l>
     <l n="257">Midst which they found that they indeed must die ;</l>
     <l n="258">And now well-nigh as much their pain was past</l>
     <l n="259">As though death 's veil already had been cast</l>
     <l n="260">Over their heads — so , midst some little mirth ,</l>
     <l n="261">They watched the dark night hide the gloomy earth .</l>
