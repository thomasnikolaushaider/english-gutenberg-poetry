     <l n="25">All the world is brighter , if the Athenian sun return :</l>
     <l n="26">All things foul on earth wax fainter , by that sun 's light stricken :</l>

     <l n="24">From each warm curve and line ,</l>
     <l n="25">Each charm of flower-sweet flesh , to reillume</l>

     <l n="46">Even to draw nigh its head ,</l>
     <l n="47">And touch , and scarce with touch or breath surprise</l>
     <l n="48">Its mild miraculous eyes</l>
     <l n="49">Out of their viewless vision — O , what then ,</l>
     <l n="50">What may be said of men ?</l>
     <l n="51">What speech may name a new-born child ? what word</l>
     <l n="52">Earth ever spake or heard ?</l>
     <l n="53">The best men 's tongue that ever glory knew</l>
     <l n="54">Called that a drop of dew</l>
     <l n="55">Which from the breathing creature 's kindly womb</l>
     <l n="56">Came forth in blameless bloom .</l>
     <l n="57">We have no word , as had those men most high ,</l>
     <l n="58">To call a baby by .</l>
     <l n="59">Rose , ruby , lily , pearl of stormless seas —</l>
     <l n="60">A better word than these ,</l>
     <l n="61">A better sign it was than flower or gem</l>
     <l n="62">That love revealed to them :</l>
     <l n="63">They knew that whence comes light or quickening flame ,</l>
     <l n="64">Thence only this thing came ,</l>
     <l n="65">And only might be likened of our love</l>
     <l n="66">To somewhat born above ,</l>
     <l n="67">Not even to sweetest things dropped else on earth ,</l>
     <l n="68">Only to dew 's own birth .</l>
     <l n="69">Nor doubt we but their sense was heavenly true ,</l>
     <l n="70">Babe , when we gaze on you ,</l>
     <l n="71">A dew-drop out of heaven whose colours are</l>
     <l n="72">More bright than sun or star ,</l>
     <l n="73">As now , ere watching love dare fear or hope ,</l>
     <l n="74">Lips , hands , and eyelids ope ,</l>
     <l n="75">And all your life is mixed with earthly leaven .</l>

     <l n="1">If the wind and the sunlight of April and August had mingled the</l>

     <l n="4">of laughter ,</l>
     <l n="5">And the blithest of singers were back with a song ; if again from</l>
     <l n="6">his tomb as from prison ,</l>
     <l n="7">If again from the night or the twilight of ages Aristophanes had</l>
     <l n="8">arisen ,</l>
     <l n="9">With the gold-feathered wings of a bird that were also a god upon</l>

     <l n="11">And the gold-flowing laugh of the manhood of old at his lips , for a</l>
     <l n="12">joy to beholders ,</l>
     <l n="13">He alone unrebuked of presumption were able to set to some adequate</l>
     <l n="14">measure</l>
     <l n="15">The delight of our eyes in the dawn that restores them the sun of</l>
     <l n="16">their sense and the pleasure .</l>
     <l n="17">For the days of the darkness of spirit are over for all of us here ,</l>
     <l n="18">and the season</l>
     <l n="19">When desire was a longing , and absence a thorn , and rejoicing a</l>
     <l n="20">word without reason .</l>
     <l n="21">For the roof overhead of the pines is astir with delight as of</l>
     <l n="22">jubilant voices ,</l>
     <l n="23">And the floor underfoot of the bracken and heather alive as a heart</l>
     <l n="24">that rejoices .</l>
     <l n="25">For the house that was childless awhile , and the light of it</l>
     <l n="26">darkened , the pulse of it dwindled ,</l>
     <l n="27">Rings radiant again with a child 's bright feet , with the light of</l>
     <l n="28">his face is rekindled .</l>
     <l n="29">And the ways of the meadows that knew him , the sweep of the down</l>
     <l n="30">that the sky 's belt closes ,</l>
     <l n="31">Grow gladder at heart than the soft wind made them whose feet were</l>
     <l n="32">but fragrant with roses ,</l>
     <l n="33">Though the fall of the year be upon us , who trusted in June and by</l>
     <l n="34">June were defrauded ,</l>
     <l n="35">And the summer that brought us not back the desire of our eyes be</l>
     <l n="36">gone hence unapplauded .</l>
     <l n="37">For July came joyless among us , and August went out from us arid</l>
     <l n="38">and sterile ,</l>
     <l n="39">And the hope of our hearts , as it seemed , was no more than a flower</l>
     <l n="40">that the seasons imperil ,</l>
     <l n="41">And the joy of our hearts , as it seemed , than a thought which</l>
     <l n="42">regret had not heart to remember ,</l>
     <l n="43">Till four dark months overpast were atoned for , and summer began in</l>
     <l n="44">September .</l>
     <l n="45">Hark , April again as a bird in the house with a child 's voice</l>
     <l n="46">hither and thither :</l>
     <l n="47">See , May in the garden again with a child 's face cheering the woods</l>
     <l n="48">ere they wither .</l>
     <l n="49">June laughs in the light of his eyes , and July on the sunbright</l>
     <l n="50">cheeks of him slumbers ,</l>
     <l n="51">And August glows in a smile more sweet than the cadence of</l>
     <l n="52">gold-mouthed numbers .</l>
     <l n="53">In the morning the sight of him brightens the sun , and the noon</l>
     <l n="54">with delight in him flushes ,</l>
     <l n="55">And the silence of nightfall is music about him as soft as the</l>
     <l n="56">sleep that it hushes .</l>
     <l n="57">We awake with a sense of a sunrise that is not a gift of the</l>
     <l n="58">sundawn 's giving ,</l>
     <l n="59">And a voice that salutes us is sweeter than all sounds else in the</l>

     <l n="63">Though the dreams of our sleep were as those that the light of a</l>
     <l n="64">world without grief makes golden .</l>
     <l n="65">For the best that the best of us ever devised as a likeness of</l>
     <l n="66">heaven and its glory ,</l>
     <l n="67">What was it of old , or what is it and will be for ever , in song or</l>

     <l n="69">Or in shape or in colour of carven or painted resemblance , adored</l>

     <l n="71">But a vision recorded of children alive in the pictures of old or</l>
     <l n="72">the pages ?</l>
     <l n="73">Where children are not , heaven is not , and heaven if they come not</l>
     <l n="74">again shall be never :</l>
