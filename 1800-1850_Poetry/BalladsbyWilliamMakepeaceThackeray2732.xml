   <head>THE CHRONICLE OF THE DRUM .</head>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>PART I .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">At Paris , hard by the Maine barriers ,</l>
     <l n="2">Whoever will choose to repair ,</l>
     <l n="3">Midst a dozen of wooden-legged warriors</l>
     <l n="4">May haply fall in with old Pierre .</l>
     <l n="5">On the sunshiny bench of a tavern</l>
     <l n="6">He sits and he prates of old wars ,</l>
     <l n="7">And moistens his pipe of tobacco</l>
     <l n="8">With a drink that is named after Mars .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">The beer makes his tongue run the quicker ,</l>
     <l n="10">And as long as his tap never fails ,</l>
     <l n="11">Thus over his favorite liquor</l>
     <l n="12">Old Peter will tell his old tales .</l>
     <l n="13">Says he , “ In my life 's ninety summers</l>
     <l n="14">Strange changes and chances I 've seen ,—</l>
     <l n="15">So here 's to all gentlemen drummers</l>
     <l n="16">That ever have thump 'd on a skin .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">“ Brought up in the art military</l>
     <l n="18">For four generations we are ;</l>
     <l n="19">My ancestors drumm 'd for King Harry ,</l>
     <l n="20">The Huguenot lad of Navarre .</l>
     <l n="21">And as each man in life has his station</l>
     <l n="22">According as Fortune may fix ,</l>
     <l n="23">While Condé was waving the baton ,</l>
     <l n="24">My grandsire was trolling the sticks .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">“ Ah ! those were the days for commanders !</l>
     <l n="26">What glories my grandfather won ,</l>
     <l n="27">Ere bigots , and lackeys , and panders</l>
     <l n="28">The fortunes of France had undone !</l>
     <l n="29">In Germany , Flanders , and Holland ,—</l>
     <l n="30">What foeman resisted us then ?</l>
     <l n="31">No ; my grandsire was ever victorious ,</l>
     <l n="32">My grandsire and Monsieur Turenne .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">“ He died : and our noble battalions</l>
     <l n="34">The jade fickle Fortune forsook ;</l>
     <l n="35">And at Blenheim , in spite of our valiance ,</l>
     <l n="36">The victory lay with Malbrook .</l>
     <l n="37">The news it was brought to King Louis ;</l>
     <l n="38">Corbleu ! how his Majesty swore</l>
     <l n="39">When he heard they had taken my grandsire :</l>
     <l n="40">And twelve thousand gentlemen more .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">“ At Namur , Ramillies , and Malplaquet</l>
     <l n="42">Were we posted , on plain or in trench :</l>
     <l n="43">Malbrook only need to attack it</l>
     <l n="44">And away from him scamper 'd we French .</l>
     <l n="45">Cheer up ! ‘ tis no use to be glum , boys ,—</l>
     <l n="46">‘ Tis written , since fighting begun ,</l>
     <l n="47">That sometimes we fight and we conquer ,</l>
     <l n="48">And sometimes we fight and we run .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="49">“ To fight and to run was our fate :</l>
     <l n="50">Our fortune and fame had departed .</l>
     <l n="51">And so perish 'd Louis the Great ,—</l>
     <l n="52">Old , lonely , and half broken-hearted .</l>
     <l n="53">His coffin they pelted with mud ,</l>
     <l n="54">His body they tried to lay hands on ;</l>
     <l n="55">And so having buried King Louis</l>
     <l n="56">They loyally served his great-grandson .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="57">“ God save the beloved King Louis !</l>
     <l n="58">( For so he was nicknamed by some ,)</l>
     <l n="59">And now came my father to do his</l>
     <l n="60">King 's orders and beat on the drum .</l>
     <l n="61">My grandsire was dead , but his bones</l>
     <l n="62">Must have shaken I 'm certain for joy ,</l>
     <l n="63">To hear daddy drumming the English</l>
     <l n="64">From the meadows of famed Fontenoy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="65">“ So well did he drum in that battle</l>
     <l n="66">That the enemy show 'd us their backs ;</l>
     <l n="67">Corbleu ! it was pleasant to rattle</l>
     <l n="68">The sticks and to follow old Saxe !</l>
     <l n="69">We next had Soubise as a leader ,</l>
     <l n="70">And as luck hath its changes and fits ,</l>
     <l n="71">At Rossbach , in spite of dad 's drumming ,</l>
     <l n="72">‘ Tis said we were beaten by Fritz .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="73">“ And now daddy cross 'd the Atlantic ,</l>
     <l n="74">To drum for Montcalm and his men ;</l>
     <l n="75">Morbleu ! but it makes a man frantic</l>
     <l n="76">To think we were beaten again !</l>
     <l n="77">My daddy he cross 'd the wide ocean ,</l>
     <l n="78">My mother brought me on her neck ,</l>
     <l n="79">And we came in the year fifty-seven</l>
     <l n="80">To guard the good town of Quebec .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="81">“ In the year fifty-nine came the Britons ,—</l>
     <l n="82">Full well I remember the day ,—</l>
     <l n="83">They knocked at our gates for admittance ,</l>
     <l n="84">Their vessels were moor 'd in our bay .</l>
     <l n="85">Says our general , ‘ Drive me yon redcoats</l>
     <l n="86">Away to the sea whence they come ! ’</l>
     <l n="87">So we marched against Wolfe and his bull-dogs ,</l>
     <l n="88">We marched at the sound of the drum .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="89">“ I think I can see my poor mammy</l>
     <l n="90">With me in her hand as she waits ,</l>
     <l n="91">And our regiment , slowly retreating ,</l>
     <l n="92">Pours back through the citadel gates .</l>
     <l n="93">Dear mammy she looks in their faces ,</l>
     <l n="94">And asks if her husband is come ?</l>
     <l n="95">— He is lying all cold on the glacis ,</l>
     <l n="96">And will never more beat on the drum .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="97">“ Come , drink , ‘ tis no use to be glum , boys ,</l>
     <l n="98">He died like a soldier in glory ;</l>
     <l n="99">Here 's a glass to the health of all drum-boys ,</l>
     <l n="100">And now I 'll commence my own story .</l>
     <l n="101">Once more did we cross the salt ocean ,</l>
     <l n="102">We came in the year eighty-one ;</l>
     <l n="103">And the wrongs of my father the drummer</l>
     <l n="104">Were avenged by the drummer his son .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="105">“ In Chesapeake Bay we were landed .</l>
     <l n="106">In vain strove the British to pass :</l>
     <l n="107">Rochambeau our armies commanded ,</l>
     <l n="108">Our ships they were led by De Grasse .</l>
     <l n="109">Morbleu ! How I rattled the drumsticks</l>
     <l n="110">The day we march 'd into Yorktown ;</l>
     <l n="111">Ten thousand of beef-eating British</l>
     <l n="112">Their weapons we caused to lay down .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="113">“ Then homewards returning victorious ,</l>
     <l n="114">In peace to our country we came ,</l>
     <l n="115">And were thanked for our glorious actions</l>
     <l n="116">By Louis Sixteenth of the name .</l>
     <l n="117">What drummer on earth could be prouder</l>
     <l n="118">Than I , while I drumm 'd at Versailles</l>
     <l n="119">To the lovely court ladies in powder ,</l>
     <l n="120">And lappets , and long satin-tails ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="121">“ The Princes that day pass 'd before us ,</l>
     <l n="122">Our countrymen 's glory and hope ;</l>
     <l n="123">Monsieur , who was learned in Horace ,</l>
     <l n="124">D'Artois , who could dance the tightrope .</l>
     <l n="125">One night we kept guard for the Queen</l>
     <l n="126">At her Majesty 's opera-box ,</l>
     <l n="127">While the King , that majestical monarch ,</l>
     <l n="128">Sat filing at home at his locks .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="129">“ Yes , I drumm 'd for the fair Antoinette ,</l>
     <l n="130">And so smiling she look 'd and so tender ,</l>
     <l n="131">That our officers , privates , and drummers ,</l>
     <l n="132">All vow 'd they would die to defend her .</l>
     <l n="133">But she cared not for us honest fellows ,</l>
     <l n="134">Who fought and who bled in her wars ,</l>
     <l n="135">She sneer 'd at our gallant Rochambeau ,</l>
     <l n="136">And turned Lafayette out of doors .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="137">“ Ventrebleu ! then I swore a great oath ,</l>
     <l n="138">No more to such tyrants to kneel .</l>
     <l n="139">And so just to keep up my drumming ,</l>
     <l n="140">One day I drumm 'd down the Bastille .</l>
     <l n="141">Ho , landlord ! a stoup of fresh wine .</l>
     <l n="142">Come , comrades , a bumper we 'll try ,</l>
     <l n="143">And drink to the year eighty-nine</l>
     <l n="144">And the glorious fourth of July !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="145">“ Then bravely our cannon it thunder 'd</l>
     <l n="146">As onwards our patriots bore .</l>
     <l n="147">Our enemies were but a hundred ,</l>
     <l n="148">And we twenty thousand or more .</l>
     <l n="149">They carried the news to King Louis .</l>
     <l n="150">He heard it as calm as you please ,</l>
     <l n="151">And , like a majestical monarch ,</l>
     <l n="152">Kept filing his locks and his keys .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="153">“ We show 'd our republican courage ,</l>
     <l n="154">We storm 'd and we broke the great gate in ,</l>
     <l n="155">And we murder 'd the insolent governor</l>
     <l n="156">For daring to keep us a-waiting .</l>
     <l n="157">Lambesc and his squadrons stood by :</l>
     <l n="158">They never stirr 'd finger or thumb .</l>
     <l n="159">The saucy aristocrats trembled</l>
     <l n="160">As they heard the republican drum .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="161">“ Hurrah ! what a storm was a-brewing :</l>
     <l n="162">The day of our vengeance was come !</l>
     <l n="163">Through scenes of what carnage and ruin</l>
     <l n="164">Did I beat on the patriot drum !</l>
     <l n="165">Let 's drink to the famed tenth of August :</l>
     <l n="166">At midnight I beat the tattoo ,</l>
     <l n="167">And woke up the Pikemen of Paris</l>
     <l n="168">To follow the bold Barbaroux .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="169">“ With pikes , and with shouts , and with torches</l>

     <l n="172">A million of tatterdemalions !</l>

Have I not tried with fasting , flogging , penance , And mortified counténance For to find favor , Sophy , in thy sight ? And lo ! this night , Forgetful of my prayers , and thine own promise , Thou turnest from us ; Lettest the heathen enter in our city , And , without pity , Murder out burghers , seize upon their spouses , Burn down their houses ! Is such a breach of faith to be endured ? See what a lurid Light from the insolent invader 's torches Shines on your porches ! E'en now , with thundering battering-ram and hammer And hideous clamor ; With axemen , swordsmen , pikemen , billmen , bowmen , The conquering foemen , O Sophy ! beat your gate about your ears , Alas ! and here 's A humble company of pious men , Like muttons in a pen , Whose souls shall quickly from their bodies be thrusted , Because in you they trusted .
