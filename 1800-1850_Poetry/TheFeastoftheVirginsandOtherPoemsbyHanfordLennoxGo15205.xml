    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">At odd hours during an active and busy life I have dallied with the Muses . I found in them , in earlier years , rest from toil and drudgery and , later , relief from physical suffering .</p>
    <p n="2">Broken by over-work and compelled to abandon the practice of my profession — the law , I wrote Pauline after I had been given up to die by my physicians . It proved to be a better ‘ medicine ’ for me than all the quackeries of the quacks . It diverted my mind from myself and , perhaps , saved my life . When published , its reception by the best journals of this country and England was so flattering and , at the same time , the criticisms of some were so just , that I have been induced to carefully revise the poem and to publish my re-touched Pauline in this volume . I hope and believe I have greatly improved it . Several of the minor poems have been published heretofore in journals and magazines ; others of equal or greater age flap their wings herein for the first time ; a few peeped from the shell but yesterday .</p>
    <p n="3">I am aware that this volume contains several poems that a certain class of critics will condemn , but they are my “ chicks ” and I will gather them under my wings .</p>
    <p n="4">“ None but an author knows an author 's cares , Or Fancy 's fondness for the child she bears . ” — Cowper .</p>
    <p n="5">Much of my life has been spent in the Northwest — on the frontier of civilization , and I became personally acquainted with many of the chiefs and braves of the Dakota and Ojibway ( Chippewa ) Indians . I have written of them largely from my own personal knowledge , and endeavored , above all things , to be accurate , and to present them true to the life .</p>
    <p n="6">For several years I devoted my leisure hours to the study of the language , history , traditions , customs and superstitions of the Dakotas . These Indians are now commonly called the “ Sioux ” — a name given them by the early French traders and voyageurs . “ Dakota ” signifies alliance or confederation . Many separate bands , all having a common origin and speaking a common tongue , were united under this name . See “ Tah-Koo Wah-Kan , ” or “ The Gospel Among the Dakotas , ” by Stephen R. Riggs , pp . 1 to 6 inc .</p>
    <p n="7">They were but yesterday the occupants and owners of the fair forests and fertile prairies of Minnesota — a brave , hospitable and generous people — barbarians , indeed , but noble in their barbarism . They may be fitly called the Iroquois of the West . In form and features , in language and traditions , they are distinct from all other Indian tribes . When first visited by white men , and for many years afterwards , the Falls of St. Anthony ( by them called the Ha Ha ) was the center of their country . They cultivated corn and tobacco , and hunted the elk , the beaver and the bison . They were open-hearted , truthful and brave . In their wars with other tribes they seldom slew women or children , and rarely sacrificed the lives of their prisoners .</p>
    <p n="8">For many years their chiefs and head men successfully resisted the attempts to introduce spirituous liquors among them . More than a century ago an English trader was killed at Mendota , near the present city of St. Paul , because he persisted , after repeated warnings by the chiefs , in dealing out mini wakan ( Devil-water ) to the Dakota braves .</p>
    <p n="9">With open arms and generous hospitality they welcomed the first white men to their land , and were ever faithful in their friendship , till years of wrong and robbery , and want and insult , drove them to desperation and to war . They were barbarians , and their warfare was barbarous , but not more barbarous than the warfare of our Saxon , Celtic and Norman ancestors . They were ignorant and superstitious . Their condition closely resembled the condition of our British forefathers at the beginning of the Christian era . Macaulay says of Britain : “ Her inhabitants , when first they became known to the Tyrian mariners , were little superior to the natives of the Sandwich Islands . ” And again : “ While the German princes who reigned at Paris , Toledo , Aries and Ravenna listened with reverence to the instructions of bishops , adored the relics of martyrs , and took part eagerly in disputes touching the Nicene theology , the rulers of Wessex and Mercia were still performing savage rites in the temples of Thor and Woden . ”</p>
    <p n="10">The days of the Dakotas are done . The degenerate remnants of that once powerful and warlike people still linger around the forts and agencies of the Northwest , or chase the caribou and the elk on the banks of the Saskatchewan , but the Dakotas of old are no more . The brilliant defeat of Custer , by Sitting Bull and his braves , was their last grand rally against the resistless march of the sons of the Saxons . The plow-shares of a superior race are fast leveling the sacred mounds of their dead . But yesterday , the shores of our lakes and our rivers were dotted with their teepees , their light canoes glided over our waters , and their hunters chased the deer and the buffalo on the sites of our cities . To-day , they are not . Let us do justice to their memory , for there was much that was noble in their natures .</p>
    <p n="11">In the Dakota Legends , I have endeavored to faithfully present many of the customs and superstitions , and some of the traditions , of that people . I have taken very little ‘ poetic license ’ with their traditions ; none , whatever , with their customs and superstitions . In my studies for these Legends I was greatly aided by the Rev . S. R . Riggs , author of the “ Grammar and Dictionary of the Dakota Language ” “ Tah-Koo Wah-Kan , ” &amp; c ., and for many years a missionary among the Dakotas . He patiently answered my numerous inquiries and gave me valuable information . I am also indebted to the late Gen. H. H . Sibley , one of the earliest American traders among them , and to Rev . S. W . Pond , of Shakopee , one of the first Protestant missionaries to these people , and himself the author of poetical versions of some of their principal legends ; to Mrs. Eastman 's “ Dacotah , ” and last , but not least , to the Rev . E. D . Neill , whose admirable “ History of Minnesota ” so fully and faithfully presents almost all that is known of the history , traditions , customs , manners and superstitions of the Dakotas .</p>
    <p n="12">In Winona I have “ tried my hand ” on a new hexameter verse . With what success , I leave to those who are better able to judge than I . If I have failed , I have but added another failure to the numerous attempts to naturalize hexameter verse in the English language .</p>
    <p n="13">It will be observed that I have slightly changed the length and the rhythm of the old hexameter line ; but it is still hexameter , and , I think , improved .</p>
    <p n="14">I have not written for profit nor published for fame . Fame is a coy goddess that rarely bestows her favors on him who seeks her — a phantom that many pursue and but few overtake .</p>
    <p n="15">She delights to hover for a time , like a ghost , over the graves of dead men who know not and care not : to the living she is a veritable Ignis Fatuus . But every man owes something to his fellowmen , and I owe much .</p>
    <p n="16">If my friends find half the pleasure in reading these poems that I have found in writing them , I shall have paid my debt and achieved success .</p>

       <l n="2">Onward rolls the Royal River , proudly sweeping to the sea ,</l>
       <l n="3">Dark and deep and grand , forever wrapt in myth and mystery .</l>
       <l n="4">Lo he laughs along the highlands , leaping o'er the granite walls ;</l>
       <l n="5">Lo he sleeps among the islands , where the loon her lover calls .</l>
       <l n="6">Still like some huge monster winding downward through the prairied plains ,</l>
       <l n="7">Seeking rest but never finding , till the tropic gulf he gains .</l>
       <l n="8">In his mighty arms he claspeth now an empire broad and grand ;</l>
       <l n="9">In his left hand lo he graspeth leagues of fen and forest land ;</l>
       <l n="10">In his right the mighty mountains , hoary with eternal snow ,</l>
       <l n="11">Where a thousand foaming fountains singing seek the plains below .</l>
       <l n="12">Fields of corn and feet of cities lo the mighty river laves ,</l>
       <l n="13">Where the Saxon sings his ditties o'er the swarthy warriors ’ graves .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="14">Aye , before the birth of Moses — ere the Pyramids were piled —</l>
       <l n="15">All his banks were red with roses from the sea to nor'lands wild ,</l>
       <l n="16">And from forest , fen and meadows , in the deserts of the north ,</l>
       <l n="17">Elk and bison stalked like shadows , and the tawny tribes came forth ;</l>
       <l n="18">Deeds of death and deeds of daring on his leafy banks were done ,</l>
       <l n="19">Women loved and men went warring , ere the siege of Troy begun .</l>
       <l n="20">Where his foaming waters thundered , roaring o'er the rocky walls ,</l>
       <l n="21">Dusky hunters sat and wondered , listening to the spirits ’ calls .</l>
       <l n="22">“ Ha-ha ! "[ 76 ] cried the warrior greeting from afar the cataract 's roar ;</l>
       <l n="23">“ Ha-ha ! ” rolled the answer beating down the rock-ribbed leagues of shore .</l>
       <l n="24">Now , alas , the bow and quiver and the dusky braves have fled ,</l>
       <l n="25">And the sullen , shackled river drives the droning mills instead .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="26">Where the war-whoop rose , and after women wailed their warriors slain ,</l>
       <l n="27">List the Saxon 's silvery laughter , and his humming hives of gain .</l>
       <l n="28">Swiftly sped the tawny runner o'er the pathless prairies then ,</l>
       <l n="29">Now the iron-reindeer sooner carries weal or woe to men .</l>
       <l n="30">On thy bosom , Royal River , silent sped the birch canoe</l>
       <l n="31">Bearing brave with bow and quiver on his way to war or woo ;</l>
       <l n="32">Now with flaunting flags and streamers — mighty monsters of the deep —</l>
       <l n="33">Lo the puffing , panting steamers through thy foaming waters sweep ;</l>
       <l n="34">And behold the grain-fields golden , where the bison grazed of eld ;</l>
       <l n="35">See the fanes of forests olden by the ruthless Saxon felled .</l>
       <l n="36">Plumèd pines that spread their shadows ere Columbus spread his sails ,</l>
       <l n="37">Firs that fringed the mossy meadows ere the Mayflower braved the gales ,</l>
       <l n="38">Iron oaks that nourished bruin while the Vikings roamed the main ,</l>
       <l n="39">Crashing fall in broken ruin for the greedy marts of gain .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="40">Still forever and forever rolls the restless river on ,</l>
       <l n="41">Slumbering oft but ceasing never while the circling centuries run .</l>
       <l n="42">In his palm the lakelet lingers , in his hair the brooklets hide ,</l>
       <l n="43">Grasped within his thousand fingers lies a continent fair and wide —</l>
       <l n="44">Yea , a mighty empire swarming with its millions like the bees ,</l>
       <l n="45">Delving , drudging , striving , storming , all their lives , for golden ease .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="46">Still , methinks , the dusky shadows of the days that are no more ,</l>
       <l n="47">Stalk around the lakes and meadows , haunting oft the wonted shore :</l>
       <l n="48">Hunters from the land of spirits seek the bison and the deer</l>
       <l n="49">Where the Saxon now inherits golden field and silver mere ;</l>
       <l n="50">And beside the mound where buried lies the dark-eyed maid he loves ,</l>
       <l n="51">Some tall warrior , wan and wearied , in the misty moonlight moves .</l>
       <l n="52">See — he stands erect and lingers — stoic still , but loth to go —</l>
       <l n="53">Clutching in his tawny fingers feathered shaft and polished bow .</l>
       <l n="54">Never wail or moan he utters and no tear is on his face ,</l>
       <l n="55">But a warrior 's curse he mutters on the crafty Saxon race .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="56">O thou dark , mysterious River , speak and tell thy tales to me ;</l>
       <l n="57">Seal not up thy lips forever — veiled in mist and mystery .</l>
       <l n="58">I will sit and lowly listen at the phantom-haunted falls</l>
       <l n="59">Where thy waters foam and glisten o'er the rugged , rocky walls ,</l>
       <l n="60">Till some spirit of the olden , mystic , weird , romantic days</l>
       <l n="61">Shall emerge and pour her golden tales and legends through my lays .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="62">Then again the elk and bison on thy grassy banks shall feed ,</l>
       <l n="63">And along the low horizon shall the plumed hunter speed ;</l>
       <l n="64">Then again on lake and river shall the silent birch canoe</l>
       <l n="65">Bear the brave with bow and quiver on his way to war or woo :</l>
       <l n="66">Then the beaver on the meadow shall rebuild his broken wall ,</l>
       <l n="67">And the wolf shall chase his shadow and his mate the panther call .</l>
       <l n="68">From the prairies and the regions where the pine-plumed forest grows</l>
       <l n="69">Shall arise the tawny legions with their lances and their bows ;</l>
       <l n="70">And again the cries of battle shall resound along the plain ,</l>
       <l n="71">Bows shall twang and quivers rattle , women wail their warriors slain ;</l>
       <l n="72">And by lodge-fire lowly burning shall the mother from afar</l>

      <head>THE FEAST OF THE VIRGINS</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The sun sails high in his azure realms ;</l>
       <l n="2">Beneath the arch of the breezy elms</l>
       <l n="3">The feast is spread by the murmuring river .</l>
       <l n="4">With his battle-spear and his bow and quiver ,</l>
       <l n="5">And eagle-plumes in his ebon hair ,</l>
       <l n="6">The chief Wakâwa himself is there ;</l>
       <l n="7">And round the feast , in the Sacred Ring ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 48 ]</span></l>
       <l n="8">Sit his weaponed warriors witnessing .</l>
       <l n="9">Not a morsel of food have the Virgins tasted</l>
       <l n="10">For three long days ere the holy feast ;</l>
       <l n="11">They sat in their teepee alone and fasted ,</l>
       <l n="12">Their faces turned to the Sacred East .<span type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span></l>
       <l n="13">In the polished bowls lies the golden maize ,</l>
       <l n="14">And the flesh of fawn on the polished trays .</l>
       <l n="15">For the Virgins the bloom of the prairies wide —</l>
       <l n="16">The blushing pink and the meek blue-bell ,</l>
       <l n="17">The purple plumes of the prairie 's pride ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 49 ]</span></l>
       <l n="18">The wild , uncultured asphodel ,</l>
       <l n="19">And the beautiful , blue-eyed violet</l>
       <l n="20">That the Virgins call “ Let-me-not forget , ”</l>
       <l n="21">In gay festoons and garlands twine</l>
       <l n="22">With the cedar sprigs<span type="note_anchor">[ 50 ]</span>and the wildwood vine .</l>
       <l n="23">So gaily the Virgins are decked and dressed ,</l>
       <l n="24">And none but a virgin may enter there ;</l>
       <l n="25">And clad is each in a scarlet vest ,</l>
       <l n="26">And a fawn-skin frock to the brown calves bare .</l>
       <l n="27">Wild rose-buds peep from their flowing hair ,</l>
       <l n="28">And a rose half blown on the budding breast ;</l>
       <l n="29">And bright with the quills of the porcupine</l>
       <l n="30">The moccasined feet of the maidens shine .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="31">Hand in hand round the feast they dance ,</l>
       <l n="32">And sing to the notes of a rude bassoon ,</l>
       <l n="33">And never a pause or a dissonance</l>
       <l n="34">In the merry dance or the merry tune .</l>
       <l n="35">Brown-bosomed and fair as the rising moon ,</l>
       <l n="36">When she peeps o'er the hills of the dewy east ,</l>
       <l n="37">Wiwâstè sings at the Virgins ’ Feast ;</l>
       <l n="38">And bright is the light in her luminous eyes ;</l>
       <l n="39">They glow like the stars in the winter skies ;</l>
       <l n="40">And the lilies that bloom in her virgin heart</l>
       <l n="41">Their golden blush to her cheeks impart —</l>
       <l n="42">Her cheeks half-hid in her midnight hair .</l>
       <l n="43">Fair is her form — as the red fawn 's fair —</l>
       <l n="44">And long is the flow of her raven hair ;</l>
       <l n="45">It falls to her knees and it streams on the breeze</l>
       <l n="46">Like the path of a storm on the swelling seas .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="47">Proud of their rites are the Virgins fair ,</l>
       <l n="48">For none but a virgin may enter there .</l>

       <l n="51">If a tarnished maiden should enter there .</l>
       <l n="52">And her that enters the Sacred Ring</l>
       <l n="53">With a blot that is known or a secret stain</l>
       <l n="54">The warrior who knows is bound to expose ,</l>
       <l n="55">And lead her forth from the ring again .</l>
       <l n="56">And the word of a brave is the fiat of law ;</l>
       <l n="57">For the Virgins ’ Feast is a sacred thing .</l>
       <l n="58">Aside with the mothers sat Hârpstinà ;</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="60">Round and round to the merry song</l>
       <l n="61">The maidens dance in their gay attire ,</l>
       <l n="62">While the loud Ho-Ho 's of the tawny throng</l>
       <l n="63">Their flying feet and their song inspire .</l>
       <l n="64">They have finished the song and the sacred dance ,</l>
       <l n="65">And hand in hand to the feast advance —</l>
       <l n="66">To the polished bowls of the golden maize ,</l>
       <l n="67">And the sweet fawn-meat in the polished trays .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="68">Then up from his seat in the silent crowd</l>
       <l n="69">Rose the frowning , fierce-eyed , tall Red Cloud ;</l>
       <l n="70">Swift was his stride as the panther 's spring ,</l>
       <l n="71">When he leaps on the fawn from his cavern lair ;</l>
       <l n="72">Wiwâstè he caught by her flowing hair ,</l>
       <l n="73">And dragged her forth from the Sacred Ring .</l>
       <l n="74">She turned on the warrior , her eyes flashed fire ;</l>
       <l n="75">Her proud lips quivered with queenly ire ;</l>
       <l n="76">And her sun-browned cheeks were aflame with red .</l>
       <l n="77">Her hand to the spirits she raised and said :</l>
       <l n="78">“ I am pure !— I am pure as the falling snow !</l>
       <l n="79">Great Tâku-skán-skán<span type="note_anchor">[ 51 ]</span>will testify !</l>
       <l n="80">And dares the tall coward to say me no ? ”</l>
       <l n="81">But the sullen warrior made no reply .</l>
       <l n="82">She turned to the chief with her frantic cries :</l>
       <l n="83">“ Wakâwa ,— my Father ! he lies ,— he lies !</l>
       <l n="84">Wiwâstè is pure as the fawn unborn ;</l>
       <l n="85">Lead me back to the feast or Wiwâstè dies ! ”</l>
       <l n="86">But the warriors uttered a cry of scorn ,</l>
       <l n="87">And he turned his face from her pleading eyes .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="88">Then the sullen warrior , the tall Red Cloud ,</l>
       <l n="89">Looked up and spoke and his voice was loud ;</l>

       <l n="95">The warrior would fain , but he dares not spare ;</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="97">She clutched her hair in her clinchèd hand ;</l>

       <l n="103">And plunged it clean to the polished hilt —</l>

      <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
      <p>Fair morning sat upon the mountain-top , Night skulking crept into the mountain-chasm . The silent ships slept in the silent bay ; One broad blue bent of ether domed the heavens , One broad blue distance lay the shadowy land , One broad blue vast of silence slept the sea . Now from the dewy groves the joyful birds In carol-concert sang their matin songs Softly and sweetly — full of prayer and praise . Then silver-chiming , solemn-voiced bells Rung out their music on the morning air , And Lisbon gathered to the festival In chapel and cathedral . Choral hymns And psalms of sea-toned organs mingling rose With sweetest incense floating up to heaven , Bearing the praises of the multitudes ; And all was holy peace and holy happiness . A rumbling of deep thunders in the deep ; The vast sea shuddered and the mountains groaned ; Up-heaved the solid earth — the nether rocks Burst — and the sea — the earth — the echoing heavens Thundered infernal ruin . On their knees The trembling multitudes received the shock , And dumb with sudden terror bowed their heads To toppling spire and plunging wall and dome .</p>
      <p n="1">So shook the mighty North the sudden roar Of Treason thundering on the April air — An earthquake shock that jarred the granite hills And westward rolled against th ’ eternal walls Rock-built Titanic — for a moment shook : Uprose a giant and with iron hands Grasped his huge hammer , claspt his belt of steel , And o'er the Midgard-monster mighty Thor Loomed for the combat .</p>
      <p n="2">Peace — O blessed Peace ! The war-worn veterans hailed thee with a shout Of Alleluias ;— homeward wound the trains , And homeward marched the bayonet-bristling columns To “ Hail Columbia ” from a thousand horns — Marched to the jubilee of chiming bells , Marched to the joyful peals of cannon , marched With blazing banners and victorious songs Into the outstretched arms of love and home .</p>
      <p n="3">But there be columns — columns of the dead That slumber on an hundred battle-fields — No bugle-blast shall waken till the trump Of the Archangel . O the loved and lost ! For them no jubilee of chiming bells ; For them no cannon-peal of victory ; For them no outstretched arms of love and home . God 's peace be with them . Heroes who went down , Wearing their stars , live in the nation 's songs And stories — there be greater heroes still , That molder in unnumbered nameless graves Erst bleached unburied on the fields of fame Won by their valor . Who will sing of these — Sing of the patriot-deeds on field and flood — Of these — the truer heroes — all unsung ? Where sleeps the modest bard in Quaker gray Who blew the pibroch ere the battle lowered , Then pitched his tent upon the balmy beach ? “ Snow-bound , ” I ween , among his native hills . And where the master hand that swept the lyre Till wrinkled critics cried “ Excelsior ” ? Gathering the “ Aftermath ” in frosted fields . Then , timid Muse , no longer shake thy wings For airy realms and fold again in fear ; A broken flight is better than no flight ; Be thine the task , as best you may , to sing The deeds of one who sleeps at Gettysburg Among the thousands in a common grave . The story of his life I bid you tell As it was told one windy winter night To veterans gathered around the festal board , Fighting old battles over where the field Ran red with wine , and all the battle-blare Was merry laughter and the merry songs — Told when the songs were sung by him who heard The pith of it from the dying soldier 's lips — His Captain — tell it as the Captain told .</p>

       <l n="1">“ Well , comrades , let us fight one battle more ;</l>
       <l n="2">Let the cock crow — we 'll guard the camp till morn .</l>
       <l n="3">And — since the singers and the merry ones</l>
       <l n="4">Are hors de combat — fill the cups again ;</l>
       <l n="5">Nod if you must , but listen to a tale</l>
       <l n="6">Romantic — but the warp thereof is truth .</l>
       <l n="7">When the old Flag on Sumter 's sea-girt walls</l>
       <l n="8">From its proud perch a fluttering ruin fell ,</l>
       <l n="9">I swore an oath as big as Bunker Hill ;</l>
       <l n="10">For I was younger then , nor battle-scarred ,</l>

       <l n="15">Of triumph and the nation 's jubilee .</l>
       <l n="16">Among the first that answered to my call</l>
       <l n="17">The hero came whose story you shall hear .</l>
       <l n="18">‘ Tis better I describe him : He was young —</l>
       <l n="19">Near two and twenty — neither short nor tall —</l>
       <l n="20">A slender student , and his tapering hands</l>
       <l n="21">Had better graced a maiden than a man :</l>
       <l n="22">Sad , thoughtful face — a wealth of raven hair</l>
       <l n="23">Brushed back in waves from forehead prominent ;</l>
       <l n="24">A classic nose — half Roman and half Greek ;</l>
       <l n="25">Dark , lustrous eyes beneath dark , jutting brows ,</l>
       <l n="26">Wearing a shade of sorrow , yet so keen ,</l>
       <l n="27">And in the storm of battle flashing fire .</l>

       <l n="31">To toil and hardships — men , in short , my boy ,</l>
       <l n="32">To march and fight and march and fight again . ’</l>
       <l n="33">A queer expression lit his earnest face —</l>

       <l n="37">Paul Douglas , private — and he donned the blue .</l>
       <l n="38">Paul proved himself the best in my command ;</l>
       <l n="39">I found him first at reveille , and first</l>
       <l n="40">In all the varied duties of the day .</l>
       <l n="41">His rough-hewn comrades , bred to boisterous ways ,</l>
       <l n="42">Jeered at the slender youth with maiden hands ,</l>
       <l n="43">Nicknamed him ‘ Nel , ’ and for a month or more</l>
       <l n="44">Kept up a fusillade of jokes and jeers .</l>
       <l n="45">Their jokes and jeers he heard but heeded not ,</l>
       <l n="46">Or heeding did a kindly act for him</l>
       <l n="47">That jeered him loudest ; so the hardy men</l>
       <l n="48">Came to look up to Paul as one above</l>
       <l n="49">The level of their rough and roistering ways .</l>
       <l n="50">He never joined the jolly soldier-sports ,</l>
       <l n="51">But ever was the first at bugle-call ,</l>
       <l n="52">Mastered the drill and often drilled the men .</l>
       <l n="53">Fatigued with duty , weary with the march</l>
       <l n="54">Under the blaze of the midsummer sun ,</l>
       <l n="55">He murmured not — alike in sun or rain</l>
       <l n="56">His utmost duty eager to perform ,</l>
       <l n="57">And ever ready — always just the same</l>

       <l n="63">Wheeled in dense clouds and covered all our ranks ,</l>
       <l n="64">As we marched on to battle . Then the roar</l>

       <l n="66">That music to my soldiers , and they cheered</l>

       <l n="68">And shouted ‘ On to Richmond ! ’ — He alone</l>

Unsteady his steps were and slow , and he walked with a staff in his right hand , And white as the first-falling snow were the thin locks that lay on his shoulders . Like rime-covered moss hung his beard , flowing down from his face to his girdle ; And wan was his aspect and weird , and often he chanted and mumbled In a strange and mysterious tongue , as he bent o'er his book in devotion , Or lifted his dim eyes and sung , in a low voice , the solemn “ Te Deum , ” Or Latin , or Hebrew , or Greek — all the same were his words to the warriors ,— All the same to the maids and the meek , wide-wondering-eyed , hazel-brown children .</p>

His prayer-book the hunters revered ,— they deemed it a marvelous spirit ; It spoke and the white father heard ,— it interpreted visions and omens . And often they bade him to pray this marvelous spirit to answer , And tell where the sly Chippewa might be ambushed and slain in his forest . For Menard was the first in the land , proclaiming , like John in the desert , “ The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand ; repent ye , and turn from your idols . ” The first of the brave brotherhood that , threading the fens and the forest , Stood afar by the turbulent flood at the falls of the Father of Waters .</p>

Soft hánpa [ P ] she made for his feet and leggins of velvety fawn-skin , A blanket of beaver complete , and a hood of the hide of the otter . And oft at his feet on the mat , deftly braiding the flags and the rushes , Till the sun sought his teepee she sat , enchanted with what he related Of the white-wingèd ships on the sea and the teepees far over the ocean , Of the love and the sweet charity of the Christ and the beautiful Virgin .</p>

     <p>THE FOOT RACES .</p>
     <p>On an arm of an oak hangs the prize for the swiftest and strongest of runners — A blanket as red as the skies , when the flames sweep the plains in October . And beside it a strong , polished bow , and a quiver of iron-tipped arrows , Which Kapóza 's tall chief will bestow on the fleet-footed second that follows . A score of swift runners are there from the several bands of the nation , And now for the race they prepare , and among them fleet-footed Tamdóka . With the oil of the buck and the bear their sinewy limbs are annointed , For fleet are the feet of the deer and strong are the limbs of the bruin .</p>
     <p>Hark !— the shouts and the braying of drums , and the Babel of tongues and confusion ! From his teepee the tall chieftain comes , and DuLuth brings a prize for the runners — A keen hunting-knife from the Seine , horn-handled and mounted with silver . The runners are ranged on the plain , and the Chief waves a flag as a signal , And away like the gray wolves they fly — like the wolves on the trail of the red-deer ; O'er the hills and the prairie they vie , and strain their strong limbs to the utmost , While high on the hills hangs a cloud of warriors and maidens and mothers , To see the swift-runners , and loud are the cheers and the shouts of the warriors .</p>
     <p>Now swift from the lake they return o'er the emerald hills of the prairies ; Like grey-hounds they pant and they yearn , and the leader of all is Tamdóka . At his heels flies Hu-pá-hu , [ AA ] the fleet — the pride of the band of Kaóza ,— A warrior with eagle-winged feet , but his prize is the bow and the quiver . Tamdóka first reaches the post , and his are the knife and the blanket , By the mighty acclaim of the host and award of the chief and the judges . Then proud was the tall warrior 's stride , and haughty his look and demeanor ; He boasted aloud in his pride , and he scoffed at the rest of the runners . “ Behold me , for I am a man ! [ AB ] my feet are as swift as the West-wind . With the coons and the beavers I ran ; but where is the elk or the cabri ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 80 ]</span>Come !— where is the hunter will dare match his feet with the feet of Tamdóka ? Let him think of Taté [ AC ] and beware , ere he stake his last robe on the trial . ” “ Ohó ! Ho ! Hó-héca ! "[ AD ] they jeered , for they liked not the boast of the boaster ; But to match him no warrior appeared , for his feet wore the wings of the west-wind .</p>

       <l n="34">Then fleet as the feet of a fawn</l>
       <l n="35">to her lodge ran the dark-eyed Winona ,</l>

       <l n="40">“ Tamdóka is swift , but forsooth ,</l>
       <l n="41">the tongue of his mother is swifter , ”</l>
       <l n="42">She said , and her face was aflame</l>

       <l n="44">And loud was the roar of acclaim ;</l>
       <l n="45">but dark was the face of Tamdóka .</l>
       <l n="46">They strip for the race and prepare ,—</l>
       <l n="47">DuLuth in his breeches and leggins ;</l>
       <l n="48">And the brown , curling locks of his hair</l>
       <l n="49">down droop to his bare , brawny shoulders ,</l>
       <l n="50">And his face wears a smile debonair ,</l>
       <l n="51">as he tightens his red sash around him ;</l>
       <l n="52">But stripped to the moccasins bare ,</l>
       <l n="53">save the belt and the breech-clout of buckskin ,</l>
       <l n="54">Stands the haughty Tamdóka aware</l>
       <l n="55">that the eyes of the warriors admire him ;</l>
       <l n="56">For his arms are the arms of a bear</l>
       <l n="57">and his legs are the legs of a panther .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>The drum beats ,— the chief waves the flag , and away on the course speed the runners , And away leads the brave like a stag ,— like a bound on his track flies the Frenchman ; And away haste the hunters once more to the hills , for a view to the lakeside , And the dark-swarming hill-tops , they roar with the storm of loud voices commingled . Far away o'er the prairie they fly , and still in the lead is Tamdóka , But the feet of his rival are nigh , and slowly he gains on the hunter . Now they turn on the post at the lake ,— now they run full abreast on the home-stretch : Side by side they contend for the stake for a long mile or more on the prairie They strain like a stag and a hound , when the swift river gleams through the thicket , And the horns of the riders resound , winding shrill through the depths of the forest . But behold !— at full length on the ground falls the fleet-footed Frenchman abruptly , And away with a whoop and a bound springs the eager , exulting Tamdóka Long and loud on the hills is the shout of his swarthy admirers and backers , “ But the race is not won till it 's out , ” said DuLuth , to himself as he gathered , With a frown on his face , for the foot of the wily Tamdóka had tripped him . Far ahead ran the brave on the route , and turning he boasted exultant . Like spurs to the steed to DuLuth were the jeers and the taunts of the boaster ; Indignant was he and red wroth at the trick of the runner dishonest ; And away like a whirlwind he speeds — like a hurricane mad from the mountains ; He gains on Tamdóka ,— he leads !— and behold , with the spring of a panther , He leaps to the goal and succeeds , ‘ mid the roar of the mad acclamation . Then glad as the robin in May was the voice of Winona exulting ; Tamdóka turned sullen away , and sulking he walked by the river ; He glowered as he went and the fire of revenge in his bosom was kindled : Dark was his visage with ire and his eyes were the eyes of a panther .</p>

      <head>WINONA 'S WARNING .</head>
      <head>‘ Twas sunrise ; the spirits of mist trailed their white robes on dewy savannas , And the flowers raised their heads to be kissed by the first golden beams of the morning . The breeze was abroad with the breath of the rose of the Isles of the Summer , And the humming-bird hummed on the heath from his home in the land of the rainbow . [ AI ] ‘ Twas the morn of departure . DuLuth stood alone by the roar of the Ha-ha ; Tall and fair in the strength of his youth stood the blue-eyed and fair-bearded Frenchman . A rustle of robes on the grass broke his dream as he mused by the waters , And , turning , he looked on the face of Winona , wild-rose of the prairies , Half hid in her dark , flowing hair , like the round , golden moon in the pine-tops . Admiring he gazed — she was fair as his own blooming Flore in her orchards , With her golden locks loose on the air , like the gleam of the sun through the olives , Far away on the vine-covered shore , in the sun-favored land of his fathers . “ Lists the chief to the cataract 's roar for the mournful lament of the Spirit ? "[ AJ ] Said Winona ,— “ The wail of the sprite for her babe and its father unfaithful , Is heard in the midst of the night , when the moon wanders dim in the heavens . ”</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Wild-Rose of the Prairies , ” he said ,</l>

       <l n="4">for her babe and its father unfaithful ;</l>
       <l n="5">But he lists to a voice in his heart</l>
       <l n="6">that is heard by the ear of no other ,</l>
       <l n="7">And to-day will the White Chief depart ;</l>
       <l n="8">he returns to the land of the sunrise . ”</l>
       <l n="9">“ Let Winona depart with the chief ,—</l>

From the brow of the Beautiful Isle , [ AV ] half hid in the midst of the maples , The sad-faced Winona , the while , watched the boat growing less in the distance , Till away in the bend of the stream , where it turned and was lost in the lindens , She saw the last dip and the gleam of the oars ere they vanished forever .</p>

     <p>Still afar on the waters the song , like bridal bells distantly chiming , The stout , jolly boatmen prolong , beating time with the stroke of their paddles ; And Winona 's ear , turned to the breeze , lists the air falling fainter and fainter , Till it dies like the murmur of bees when the sun is aslant on the meadows .

     <p>THE CANOE RACE .</p>
     <p>Now a light rustling wind from the South shakes his wings o'er the wide , wimpling waters : Up the dark-winding river DuLuth follows fast in the wake of Tamdóka . On the slopes of the emerald shores leafy woodlands and prairies alternate ; On the vine-tangled islands the flowers peep timidly out at the white men ; In the dark-winding eddy the loon sits warily watching and voiceless , And the wild-goose , in reedy lagoon , stills the prattle and play of her children . The does and their sleek , dappled fawns prick their ears and peer out from the thickets , And the bison-calves play on the lawns , and gambol like colts in the clover . Up the still-flowing Wákpa Wakán 's winding path through the groves and the meadows , Now DuLuth 's brawny boatmen pursue the swift-gliding bark of Tamdóka ; And hardly the red braves out-do the stout , steady oars of the white men .</p>
     <p>Now they bend to their oars in the race — the ten tawny braves of Tamdóka ; And hard on their heels in the chase ply the six stalwart oars of the Frenchmen . In the stern of his boat sits DuLuth ; in the stern of his boat sits Tamdóka , And warily , cheerily , both urge the oars of their men to the utmost . Far-stretching away to the eyes , winding blue in the midst of the meadows , As a necklet of sapphires that lies unclaspt in the lap of a virgin , Here asleep in the lap of the plain lies the reed-bordered , beautiful river . Like two flying coursers that strain , on the track , neck and neck on the home-stretch , With nostrils distended and mane froth-flecked , and the neck and the shoulders , Each urged to his best by the cry and the whip and the rein of his rider , Now they skim o'er the waters and fly , side by side , neck and neck , through the meadows , The blue heron flaps from the reeds , and away wings her course up the river : Straight and swift is her flight o'er the meads , but she hardly outstrips the canoemen . See ! the voyageurs bend to their oars till the blue veins swell out on their foreheads ; And the sweat from their brawny breasts pours ; but in vain their Herculean labor ; For the oars of Tamdóka are ten , and but six are the oars of the Frenchman , And the red warriors ’ burden of men is matched by the voyageurs ’ luggage . Side by side , neck and neck , for a mile , still they strain their strong arms to the utmost , Till rounding a willowy isle , now ahead creeps the boat of Tamdóka , And the neighboring forests profound , and the far-stretching plain of the meadows To the whoop of the victors resound , while the panting French rest on their paddles .</p>

      <head>IN CAMP .</head>
      <head>With sable wings wide o'er the land night sprinkles the dew of the heavens ; And hard by the dark river 's strand , in the midst of a tall , somber forest , Two camp fires are lighted and beam on the trunks and the arms of the pine trees . In the fitful light darkle and gleam the swarthy-hued faces around them . And one is the camp of DuLuth , and the other the camp of Tamdóka . But few are the jests and uncouth of the voyageurs over their supper , While moody and silent the braves round their fire in a circle sit crouching ; And low is the whisper of leaves and the sough of the wind in the branches ; And low is the long-winding howl of the lone wolf afar in the forest ; But shrill is the hoot of the owl , like a bugle-blast blown in the pine-tops , And the half-startled voyageurs scowl at the sudden and saucy intruder . Like the eyes of the wolves are the eyes of the watchful and silent Dakotas ; Like the face of the moon in the skies , when the clouds chase each other across it , Is Tamdóka 's dark face in the light of the flickering flames of the camp-fire . They have plotted red murder by night , and securely contemplate their victims . But wary and armed to the teeth are the resolute Frenchmen , and ready , If need be , to grapple with death , and to die hand to hand in the forest . Yet skilled in the arts and the wiles of the cunning and crafty Algonkins [ AW ] They cover their hearts with their smiles , and hide their suspicions of evil . Round their low , smouldering fire , feigning sleep , lie the watchful and wily Dakotas ; But DuLuth and his voyageurs heap their fire that shall blaze till the morning , Ere they lay themselves snugly to rest , with their guns by their sides on the blankets , As if there were none to molest but the gray , skulking wolves of the forest .</head>

     <p>In the gray of the morn , ere the sun peeped over the dewy horizon , Their journey again was begun , and they toiled up the swift , winding river ; And many a shallow they passed on their way to the Lake of the Spirits ; [ AX ] But dauntless they reached it at last , and found Akee-pá-kee-tin 's [ AY ] village , On an isle in the midst of the lake ; and a day in his teepees they tarried . Of the deed in the wilderness spake , to the brave Chief , the frank-hearted Frenchman . A generous man was the Chief , and a friend of the fearless explorer ; And dark was his visage with grief at the treacherous act of the warriors . “ Brave Wází-kuté is a man , and his heart is as clear as the sunlight ; But the head of a treacherous clan and a snake-in-the-grass , is Tamdóka , ” Said the chief ; and he promised DuLuth , on the word of a friend and a warrior , To carry the pipe and the truth to his cousin , the chief at Kathága ; For thrice at the Tânka Medé he smoked in the lodge of the Frenchman ; And thrice had he carried away the bountiful gifts of the trader .</p>

     <p>When the chief could no longer prevail on the white men to rest in his teepees , He guided their feet on the trail to the lakes of the winding Rice-River . [ AZ ] Now on speeds the light bark canoe , through the lakes to the broad Gitchee Seebee ; [ BA ] And up the great river they row ,— up the Big Sandy Lake and Savanna ; And down through the meadows they go to the river of blue Gitchee-Gumee . [ BB ] Still onward they speed to the Dalles — to the roar of the white-rolling rapids , Where the dark river tumbles and falls down the ragged ravine of the mountains . And singing his wild jubilee to the low-moaning pines and the cedars , Rushes on to the unsalted sea o'er the ledges upheaved by volcanoes . Their luggage the voyageurs bore down the long , winding path of the portage , [ BC ] While they mingled their song with the roar of the turbid and turbulent waters . Down-wimpling and murmuring there ‘ twixt two dewy hills winds a streamlet , Like a long , flaxen ringlet of hair on the breast of a maid in her slumber .</p>
     <p>All safe at the foot of the trail , where they left it , they found their felucca , And soon to the wind spread the sail , and glided at ease through the waters ,— Through the meadows and lakelets and forth , round the point stretching south like a finger , From the pine-plumed hills on the north , sloping down to the bay and the lake-side And behold , at the foot of the hill , a cluster of Chippewa wigwams , And the busy wives plying with skill their nets in the emerald waters . Two hundred white winters and more have fled from the face of the Summer Since DuLuth on that wild , somber shore , in the unbroken forest primeval , From the midst of the spruce and the pines , saw the smoke of the wigwams up-curling , Like the fumes from the temples and shrines of the Druids of old in their forests . Ah , little he dreamed then , forsooth , that a city would stand on that hill-side , And bear the proud name of DuLuth , the untiring and dauntless explorer ,— A refuge for ships from the storms , and for men from the bee-hives of Europe , Out-stretching her long , iron arms o'er an empire of Saxons and Normans .</p>

       <l n="5">At the touch of his breath</l>

       <l n="7">From his nostrils the white vapors rose ,</l>

       <l n="9">Like the down of Magá [ BJ ] fell the snows ,</l>
       <l n="10">tossed and whirled into heaps by the North-wind .</l>
       <l n="11">Then the blinding storms roared on the plains ,</l>
       <l n="12">like the simoons on sandy Sahara ;</l>
       <l n="13">From the fangs of the fierce hurricanes</l>
       <l n="14">fled the elk and the deer and the bison .</l>
       <l n="15">Ever colder and colder it grew ,</l>
       <l n="16">till the frozen ground cracked and split open ;</l>
       <l n="17">And harder and harder it blew ,</l>
       <l n="18">till the hillocks were bare as the boulders .</l>

       <l n="35">In the tee of Ta-té-psin the store</l>

       <l n="44">to his heart is the dark-eyed Winona . ”</l>
       <l n="45">The aged Chief opened his ears ;</l>

       <l n="47">But the moans of his child and her tears</l>
       <l n="48">touched the age-softened heart of the father ,</l>
       <l n="49">And he said , “ I am burdened with years ,—</l>
       <l n="50">I am bent by the snows of my winters ;</l>
       <l n="51">Ta-té-psin will die in his tee ;</l>
       <l n="52">let him pass to the Land of the Spirits ;</l>

       <l n="54">and her own heart shall choose her a husband . ”</l>
       <l n="55">The dark warrior strode from the tee ;</l>
       <l n="56">low-muttering and grim he departed ;</l>

     <p>Then forth went Winona . The bow of Ta-té-psin she took and his arrows , And afar o'er the deep , drifted snow through the forest she sped on her snow shoes . Over meadow and ice-covered mere , through the thickets of red-oak and hazel , She followed the tracks of the deer , but like phantoms they fled from her vision . From sunrise to sunset she sped ; half famished she camped in the thicket ; In the cold snow she made her lone bed ; on the buds of the birch [ BN ] made her supper . To the dim moon the gray owl preferred , from the tree-top , his shrill lamentation , And around her at midnight she heard the dread famine-cries of the gray wolves . In the gloam of the morning again on the trail of the red-deer she followed — All day long through the thickets in vain , for the gray wolves were chasing the roebucks ; And the cold , hungry winds from the plain chased the wolves and the deer and Winona .</p>

      <head>DEATH OF TA-TE-PSIN .</head>
      <head>The long winter wanes . On the wings of the spring come the geese and the mallards ; On the bare oak the red-robin sings , and the crocus peeps up on the prairies , And the bobolink pipes , but he brings of the blue-eyed , brave White Chief no tidings . With the waning of winter , alas , waned the life of the aged Ta-té-psin ; Ere the wild pansies peeped from the grass , to the Land of the Spirits he journeyed ; Like a babe in its slumber he passed , or the snow from the hill-tops of April ; And the dark-eyed Winona , at last , stood alone by the graves of her kindred . When their myriad mouths opened the trees to the sweet dew of heaven and the raindrops , And the April showers fell on the leas , on his mound fell the tears of Winona . Round her drooping form gathered the years and the spirits unseen of her kindred , As low , in the midst of her tears , at the grave of her father she chanted</head>

     <p>Still hope , like a star in the night gleaming oft through the broken clouds somber , Cheered the heart of Winona , and bright on her dreams beamed the face of the Frenchman . As the thought of a loved one and lost , sad and sweet were her thoughts of the White Chief ; In the moon 's mellow light , like a ghost , walked Winona alone by the Ha-Ha , Ever wrapped in a dream . Far away — to the land of the sunrise — she wandered ; On the blue-rolling Tánka-Medé [ BR ] in the midst of her dreams , she beheld him — In his white-winged canoe , like a bird , to the land of Dakotas returning ,</p>
     <p>[ BR ] Lake Superior ,— The Gitchee Gumee of the Chippewas .</p>
     <p>And often in fancy she heard the dip of his oars on the river . On the dark waters glimmered the moon , but she saw not the boat of the Frenchman . On the somber night bugled the loon , but she heard not the song of the boatmen . The moon waxed and waned , but the star of her hope never waned to the setting ; Through her tears she beheld it afar , like a torch on the eastern horizon . “ He will come ,— he is coming , ” she said ; “ he will come , for my White Eagle promised , ” And low to the bare earth the maid bent her ear for the sound of his footsteps , “ He is gone , but his voice in my ear still remains like the voice of the robin ; He is far , but his footsteps I hear ; he is coming ; my White Chief is coming ! ” But the moon waxed and waned . Nevermore will the eyes of Winona behold him . Far away on the dark , rugged shore of the blue Gitchee Gúmee he lingers . No tidings the rising sun brings ; no tidings the star of the evening ; But morning and evening she sings , like a turtle-dove widowed and waiting :</p>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">When Mollie and I were married from the dear old cottage-home ,</l>
       <l n="2">In the vale between the hills of fir and pine ,</l>
       <l n="3">I parted with a sigh in a stranger-land to roam ,</l>
       <l n="4">And to seek a western home for me and mine .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">By a grove-encircled lake in the wild and prairied West ,</l>
       <l n="6">As the sun was sinking down one summer day ,</l>
       <l n="7">I laid my knapsack down and my weary limbs to rest ,</l>
       <l n="8">And resolved to build a cottage-home and stay .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">I staked and marked my “ corners , ” and I “ filed ” upon my claim ,</l>
       <l n="10">And I built a cottage-home of “ logs and shakes ; ”</l>
       <l n="11">And then I wrote a letter , and Mollie and baby came</l>
       <l n="12">Out to bless me and to bake my johnny-cakes .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">When Mollie saw my “ cottage ” and the way that I had “ bached ” ,</l>
       <l n="14">She smiled , but I could see that she was “ blue ; ”</l>
       <l n="15">Then she found my “ Sunday-clothes ” all soiled and torn and patched ,</l>
       <l n="16">And she hid her face and shed a tear or two .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">But she went to work in earnest and the cabin fairly shone ,</l>
       <l n="18">And her dinners were so savory and so nice</l>
       <l n="19">That I felt it was “ not good that the man should be alone ” —</l>
       <l n="20">Even in this lovely land of Paradise .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="21">Well , the neighbors they were few and were many miles apart ,</l>
       <l n="22">And you could n't hear the locomotive scream ;</l>
       <l n="23">But I was young and hardy , and my Mollie gave me heart ,</l>
       <l n="24">And my “ steers ” they made a fast and fancy team .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="25">And the way I broke the sod was a marvel , you can bet ,</l>
       <l n="26">For I fed my “ steers ” before the dawn of day ;</l>
       <l n="27">And when the sun went under I was plowing prairie yet ,</l>
       <l n="28">Till my Mollie blew the old tin horn for tea .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="29">And the lazy , lousy “ Injuns ” came a-loafing round the lake ,</l>
       <l n="30">And a-begging for a bone or bit of bread ;</l>
       <l n="31">And the sneaking thieves would steal whatever they could take —</l>
       <l n="32">From the very house where they were kindly fed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="33">O the eastern preachers preach , and the long-haired poets sing</l>
       <l n="34">Of the “ noble braves ” and “ dusky maidens fair ; ”</l>
       <l n="35">But if they had pioneered ‘ twould have been another thing</l>
       <l n="36">When the “ Injuns ” got a-hankering for their “ hair . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="37">Often when we lay in bed in the middle of the night ,</l>
       <l n="38">How the prairie-wolves would howl their jubilee !</l>
       <l n="39">Then Mollie she would waken in a shiver and a fright ,</l>
       <l n="40">Clasp our baby-pet and snuggle up to me .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="41">There were hardships you may guess , and enough of weary toil</l>
       <l n="42">For the first few years , but then it was so grand</l>
       <l n="43">To see the corn and wheat waving o'er the virgin soil ,</l>
       <l n="44">And two stout and loving hearts went hand in hand .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="45">But Mollie took the fever when our second babe was born ,</l>
       <l n="46">And she lay upon the bed as white as snow ;</l>
       <l n="47">And my idle cultivator lay a rusting in the corn ;</l>
       <l n="48">And the doctor said poor Mollie she must go .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="49">Now I never prayed before , but I fell upon my knees ,</l>
       <l n="50">And I prayed as never any preacher prayed ;</l>
       <l n="51">And Mollie always said that it broke the fell disease ;</l>
       <l n="52">And I truly think the Lord He sent us aid :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="53">For the fever it was broken , and she took a bit of food ,</l>
       <l n="54">And O then I went upon my knees again ;</l>
       <l n="55">And I never cried before ,— and I never thought I could ,—</l>
       <l n="56">But my tears they fell upon her hand like rain .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="57">And I think the Lord has blessed us ever since I prayed the prayer ,</l>
       <l n="58">For my crops have never wanted rain or dew :</l>
       <l n="59">And Mollie often said in the days of debt and care ,</l>
       <l n="60">“ Do n't you worry , John , the Lord will help us through . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="61">For the “ pesky , ” painted Sioux , in the fall of ‘ sixty-two ,</l>
       <l n="62">Came a-whooping on their ponies o'er the plain ,</l>
       <l n="63">And they killed my pigs and cattle , and I tell you it looked “ blue , ”</l>
       <l n="64">When they danced around my blazing stacks of grain .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="17">
       <l n="65">And the settlers mostly fled , but I did n't have a chance ,</l>
       <l n="66">So I caught my hunting-rifle long and true ,</l>
       <l n="67">And Mollie poured the powder while I made the devils dance ,</l>
       <l n="68">To a tune that made ‘ em jump and tumble , too .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="18">
       <l n="69">And they fired upon the cabin ; ‘ twas as good as any fort ,</l>
       <l n="70">But the “ beauties ” would n't give us any rest ;</l>
       <l n="71">For they skulked and blazed away , and I did n't call it sport ,</l>
       <l n="72">For I had to do my very “ level best . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="19">
       <l n="73">Now they do n't call me a coward , but my Mollie she 's a “ brick ; ”</l>
       <l n="74">For she chucked the children down the cellar-way ,</l>
       <l n="75">And she never flinched a hair tho ’ the bullets pattered thick ,</l>
       <l n="76">And we held the “ painted beauties ” well at bay .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="20">
       <l n="77">But once when I was aiming , a bullet grazed my head ,</l>
       <l n="78">And it cut the scalp and made the air look blue ;</l>
       <l n="79">Then Mollie straightened up like a soldier and she said :</l>
       <l n="80">“ Never mind it , John , the Lord will help us through . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="21">
       <l n="81">And you bet it raised my “ grit , ” and I never flinched a bit ,</l>
       <l n="82">And my nerves they got as strong as steel or brass ;</l>
       <l n="83">And when I fired again I was sure that I had hit ,</l>
       <l n="84">For I saw the skulking devil “ claw the grass . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="22">
       <l n="85">Well , the fight was long and hot , and I got a charge of shot</l>
       <l n="86">In the shoulder , but it never broke a bone ;</l>
       <l n="87">And I never stopped to think whether I was hit or not</l>
       <l n="88">Till we found our ammunition almost gone .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="23">
       <l n="89">But the “ Rangers ” came at last — just as we were out of lead ,—</l>
       <l n="90">And I thanked the Lord , and Mollie thanked Him , too ;</l>
       <l n="91">Then she put her arms around my neck and sobbed and cried and said :</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="24">

       <l n="6">Beneath my feet the waters beat , and ripple on the polished stones ,</l>
       <l n="7">The squirrel chatters from his seat ; the bag-pipe beetle hums and drones .</l>
       <l n="8">The pink and gold in blooming wold ,— the green hills mirrored in the lake !</l>
       <l n="9">The deep , blue waters , zephyr-rolled , along the murmuring pebbles break .</l>
       <l n="10">The maples screen the ferns , and lean the leafy lindens o'er the deep ;</l>
       <l n="11">The sapphire , set in emerald green , lies like an Orient gem asleep .</l>
       <l n="12">The crimson west glows</l>
       <l n="13">like the breast of Rhuddin [ CA ] when he pipes in May ,</l>
       <l n="14">As downward droops the sun to rest , and shadows gather on the bay .</l>
       <l n="15">In amber sky the swallows fly and sail and circle o'er the deep ;</l>
       <l n="16">The light-winged night-hawks whir and cry ; the silver pike and salmon leap .</l>
       <l n="17">The rising moon , o'er isle and dune , looks laughing down on lake and lea ;</l>
       <l n="18">Weird o'er the waters shrills the loon ; the high stars twinkle in the sea .</l>
       <l n="19">From bank and hill the whippowil sends piping forth his flute-like notes ,</l>
       <l n="20">And clear and shrill the answers trill from leafy isles and silver throats .</l>
       <l n="21">The twinkling light on cape and height ; the hum of voices on the shores ;</l>
       <l n="22">The merry laughter on the night ; the dip and plash of frolic oars ,—</l>
       <l n="23">These tell the tale . On hill and dale the cities pour their gay and fair ;</l>
       <l n="24">Along the sapphire lake they sail , and quaff like wine the balmy air .</l>
       <l n="25">‘ Tis well . Of yore from isle and shore</l>
       <l n="26">the smoke of Indian teepees [ CB ] rose ;</l>

       <l n="28">The moon-faced maid , in leafy glade , her warrior waited from the chase ;</l>
       <l n="29">The nut-brown , naked children played , and chased the gopher on the grass .</l>
       <l n="30">The dappled fawn on wooded lawn , peeped out upon the birch canoe ,</l>
       <l n="31">Swift-gliding in the gray of dawn along the silent waters blue .</l>
       <l n="32">In yonder tree the great Wanm-dee [ CC ] securely built her spacious nest ;</l>
       <l n="33">The blast that swept the landlocked sea [ CD ]</l>
       <l n="34">but rocked her clamorous babes to rest .</l>
       <l n="35">By grassy mere the elk and deer gazed on the hunter as he came ;</l>
       <l n="36">Nor fled with fear from bow or spear ;—</l>
       <l n="37">“ so wild were they that they were tame . ”</l>
       <l n="38">Ah , birch canoe , and hunter , too , have long forsaken lake and shore ;</l>
       <l n="39">He bade his fathers ’ bones adieu and turned away forevermore .</l>
       <l n="40">But still , methinks , on dusky brinks the spirit of the warrior moves ;</l>
       <l n="41">At crystal springs the hunter drinks , and nightly haunts the spot he loves .</l>
       <l n="42">For oft at night I see the light of lodge-fires on the shadowy shores ,</l>
       <l n="43">And hear the wail some maiden 's sprite above her slaughtered warrior pours .</l>
       <l n="44">I hear the sob , on Spirit Knob , [ BZ ] of Indian mother o'er her child ;</l>
       <l n="45">And on the midnight waters throb her low yun-he-he 's [ CE ] weird and wild :</l>
       <l n="46">And sometimes , too , the light canoe glides like a shadow o'er the deep</l>
       <l n="47">At midnight when the moon is low , and all the shores are hushed in sleep .</l>
       <l n="48">Alas ,— Alas !— for all things pass ; and we shall vanish too , as they ;</l>
       <l n="49">We build our monuments of brass , and granite , but they waste away .</l>

     <p>[ BZ ] Spirit-Knob was a small hill upon a point in the lake in full view from Wayzata . It is now washed away by the waves . The spirit of a Dakota mother , whose only child was drowned in the lake during a storm many years ago , often wailed at midnight ( so the Dakotas said ) , on this hill . So they called it Wa-na-gee Pa-zo-dan — Spirit-Knob . ( Literally — little hill of the spirit . )</p>

      <head>THE BRAVE FERRY-MAN</head>
      <note>NOTE .— The great Sioux massacre in Minnesota commenced at the Agency village , on the Minnesota River , early in the morning of the 16th day of August , 1862 , precipitated , doubtless , by the murders at Acton on the day previous . The massacre and the Indian war that followed developed many brave men , but no truer hero than Mauley , an obscure Frenchman , the ferry-man at the Agency . Continually under fire , he resolutely ran his ferry-boat back and forth across the river , affording the terror-stricken people the only chance for escape . He was shot down on his boat just as he had landed on the opposite shore the last of those who fled from the burning village to the ferry-landing . The Indians disemboweled his dead body , cut off the head , hands and feet and thrust them into the cavity . See Heard 's Hist . Sioux War , p 67 .</note>

     <p>[ CH ] The small island of rock a few rods below the Falls , was called by the Dakotas Wanagee We-ta — Spirit-Island . They say the spirit of Anpetu Sapa sits upon that island at night and pours forth her sorrow in song . They also say that from time out of mind , war-eagles nested on that island , until the advent of white men frightened them away . This seems to be true .

       <l n="2">Good morning — good morning — a happy new year !</l>
       <l n="3">We greet you , kind friends of the old Pioneer ;</l>
       <l n="4">Hope your coffee is good and your steak is well done ,</l>
       <l n="5">And you 're happy as clams in the sand and the sun .</l>
       <l n="6">The old year 's a shadow — a shade of the past ;</l>
       <l n="7">It is gone with its toils and its triumphs so vast —</l>
       <l n="8">With its joys and its tears — with its pleasure and pain —</l>
       <l n="9">With its shouts of the brave and its heaps of the slain —</l>
       <l n="10">Gone — and it cometh — no , never again .</l>
       <l n="11">And as we look forth on the future so fair</l>
       <l n="12">Let us brush from the picture the visage of care ;</l>
       <l n="13">The error , the folly , the frown and the tear —</l>
       <l n="14">Drop them all at the grave of the silent old year .</l>
       <l n="15">Has the heart been oppressed with a burden of woe ?</l>
       <l n="16">Has the spirit been cowed by a merciless blow ?</l>
       <l n="17">Has the tongue of the brave or the voice of the fair</l>
       <l n="18">Prayed to God and received no response to its prayer ?</l>
       <l n="19">Look up !— ‘ twas a shadow — the morning is here :</l>
       <l n="20">A Happy New Year !— O , a Happy New Year !</l>
       <l n="21">Yet stay for a moment . We cannot forget</l>
       <l n="22">The fields where the true and the traitor have met ;</l>
       <l n="23">When the old year came in we were trembling with fear</l>
       <l n="24">Lest Freedom should fall in her glorious career ;</l>
       <l n="25">And the roar of the conflict was loud o'er the land</l>
       <l n="26">Where the traitor-flag waved in a rebel 's red hand ;</l>
       <l n="27">But the God of the Just led the hosts of the Free ,</l>
       <l n="28">And Victory marched from the north to the sea .</l>
       <l n="29">Behold — where the conflict was doubtful and dire —</l>
       <l n="30">There — on house-top and hill-top , on fortress and spire —</l>
       <l n="31">The Old Banner waves again higher and prouder ,</l>
       <l n="32">Though torn by the shot and begrimed by the powder .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="33">God bless the brave soldiers that followed that flag</l>
       <l n="34">Through river and swamp , over mountain and crag —</l>
       <l n="35">On the wild charge triumphant — the sullen retreat —</l>
       <l n="36">On fields spread with victory or piled with defeat ;</l>
       <l n="37">God bless their true hearts for they stood like a wall ,</l>
       <l n="38">And saved us our Country and saved us our all .</l>
       <l n="39">But many a mother and many a daughter</l>
       <l n="40">Weep , alas , o'er the brave that went down in the slaughter .</l>
       <l n="41">Pile the monuments high — not on hill-top and plain —</l>
       <l n="42">To the glorious sons ‘ neath the old banner slain —</l>
       <l n="43">But over the land from the sea to the sea —</l>
       <l n="44">Pile their monuments high in the hearts of the Free .</l>
       <l n="45">Heaven bless the brave souls that are spared to return</l>
       <l n="46">Where the “ lamp in the window ” ceased never to burn —</l>
       <l n="47">Where the vacant chair stood at the desolate hearth</l>
       <l n="48">Since the son shouldered arms or the father went forth .</l>
       <l n="49">“ Peace !— Peace ! ” — was the shout ;— at the jubilant word</l>
       <l n="50">Wives and mothers went down on their knees to the Lord !</l>

       <l n="51">Methinks I can see , through the vista of years —</l>
       <l n="52">From the memories of old such a vision appears —</l>
       <l n="53">A gray-haired old veteran in arm-chair at ease ,</l>
       <l n="54">With his grandchildren clustered intent at his knees ,</l>
       <l n="55">Recounting his deeds with an eloquent tongue ,</l>
       <l n="56">And a fire that enkindles the hearts of the young ;</l>
       <l n="57">How he followed the Flag from the first to the last —</l>
       <l n="58">On the long , weary march , in the battle 's hot blast ;</l>
       <l n="59">How he marched under Sherman from center to sea ,</l>
       <l n="60">Or fought under Grant in his battles with Lee ;</l>
       <l n="61">And the old fire comes back to his eye as of yore ,</l>
       <l n="62">And his iron hand clutches his musket once more ,</l>
       <l n="63">As of old on the battle-field ghastly and red ,</l>
       <l n="64">When he sprang to the charge o'er the dying and dead ;</l>
       <l n="65">And the eyes of his listeners are gleaming with fire ,</l>
       <l n="66">As he points to that Flag floating high on the spire .</l>

    <p n="2"><span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>One of the favorite and most exciting games of the Dakotas is ball-playing . A smooth place on the prairie , or in winter , on a frozen lake or river , is chosen . Each player has a sort of bat , called “ Tâ-kée-cha-psé-cha , ” about thirty-two inches long , with a hoop at the lower end four or five inches in diameter , interlaced with thongs of deer-skin , forming a sort of pocket . With these bats they catch and throw the ball . Stakes are set as bounds at a considerable distance from the center on either side . Two parties are then formed and each chooses a leader or chief . The ball ( Tâpa ) is then thrown up half way between the bounds , and the game begins , the contestants contending with their bats for the ball as it falls . When one succeeds in getting it fairly into the pocket of his bat he swings it aloft and throws it as far as he can toward the bound to which his party is working , taking care to send it if possible where some of his own side will take it up . Thus the ball is thrown and contended for till one party succeeds in casting it beyond the bounds of the opposite party . A hundred players on a side are sometimes engaged in this exciting game . Betting on the result often runs high . Moccasins , pipes , knives , hatchets , blankets , robes and guns are hung on the prize-pole . Not unfrequently horses are staked on the issue and sometimes even women . Old men and mothers are among the spectators , praising their swift-footed sons , and young wives and maidens are there to stimulate their husbands and lovers . This game is not confined to the warriors but is also a favorite amusement of the Dakota maidens , who generally play for prizes offered by the chief or warriors . ( See Neill 's Hist . Minn ., pp 74-5 ; Riggs ’ Tâkoo Wakân , pp 44-5 , and Mrs. Eastman 's Dacotah , p 55 . )</p>

In winter Wa-zi-ya advances southward and drives I-tó-ka-ga Wi-câs-ta before him to the Summer-Islands . But in spring the god of the South having renewed his youth and strength in the “ Happy Hunting Grounds , ” is able to drive Wa-zi-ya back again to his icy wigwam in the North . Some Dakotas say that the numerous granite boulders scattered over the prairies of Minnesota and Dakota , were hurled in battle by Wa-zi-ya from his home in the North at I-tó-ka-ga Wi-câs-ta .

The Chippeways called the grandfather Ká-ká-gè — crow or raven — from his war-badge , a crow-skin ; and hence the French traders and courriers du bois called him “ Petit Corbeau ” — Little Crow . This sobriquet , of which he was proud , descended to his son , Wakinyan Tânka — Big Thunder , who succeeded him as chief ; and from Big Thunder to his son Ta-ó-ya-te-dú-ta , who became chief on the death of Wakinyan Tânka . These several “ Little Crows ” were successively Chiefs of the Light-foot , or Kapóza band of Dakotas . Kapóza , the principal village of this band , was originally located on the east bank of the Mississippi near the site of the city of St. Paul . Col. Minn. Hist . Soc ., 1864 , p. 29 . It was in later years moved to the west bank . The grandfather whom I , for short , call Wakâwa , died the death of a brave in battle against the Ojibways ( commonly called Chippeways ) — the hereditary enemies of the Dakotas . Wakinyan Tânka — Big Thunder , was killed by the accidental discharge of his own gun . They were both buried with their kindred near the “ Wakan Teepee , ” the sacred Cave — ( Carver 's Cave ) . Ta-ó-ya-te-dú-ta , the last of the Little Crows , was killed July 3 , 1863 , during the outbreak , near Hutchinson , Minnesota , by the Lampsons — father and son , and his bones were duly “ done up ” for the Historical Society of Minnesota .

    <p>LITTLE CROW . From an original photograph in the author 's possession ] Little Crow 's sixteen-year-old son , Wa-wi-na-pe — ( One who appears — like the spirit of his forefather ) was with him at the time he was killed ; but escaped , and after much hardship and suffering , was at last captured at Mini Wakan ( Devil 's Lake , in North Dakota ) . From him personally I obtained much information in regard to Little Crow 's participation in the “ Sioux War , ” and minutely the speech that Little Crow made to his braves when he finally consented to lead them on the war-path against the whites . A literal translation of that speech will be found further on in this note . I knew Ta-ó-ya-te-dú-ta , and from his own lips , in 1859-60 and 61 , obtained much interesting information in regard to the history , tradition , customs , superstitions and habits of the Dakotas , of whom he was the recognized Head-Chief . He was a remarkable Indian — a philosopher and a brave and generous man . “ Untutored savage ” that he was , he was a prince among his own people , and the peer in natural ability of the ablest white men in the Northwest in his time . He had largely adopted the dress and habits of civilized man , and he urged his people to abandon their savage ways , build houses , cultivate fields , and learn to live like the white people . He clearly forsaw the ultimate extinction of his people as a distinct race . He well knew and realized the numbers and power of the whites then rapidly taking possession of the hunting-grounds of the Dakotas , and the folly of armed opposition on the part of his people . He said to me once : “ No more Dakotas by and by ; Indians all white men . No more buffaloes by and by ; all cows , all oxen . ” But his braves were restless . They smarted under years of wrong and robbery , to which , indeed , the most stinging insults were often added by the traders and officials among them . If the true , unvarnished history of the cause and inception of the “ Sioux Outbreak ” in Minnesota is ever written and published , it will bring the blush of shame to the cheeks of every honest man who reads it . Against his judgment and repeated protests , Little Crow was at last , after the depredations had begun , forced into the war on the whites by his hot-headed and uncontrollable “ young men . ” Goaded to desperation , a party of Little Crow 's young “ bucks , ” in August , 1862 , began their depredations and spilled white blood at Acton . Returning to their chief 's camp near the agency , they told their fellow braves what they had done . The hot-headed young warriors immediately demanded of Little Crow that he put on the “ war-paint ” and lead them against the white men . The chief severely rebuked the “ young men ” who had committed the murders , blackened his face ( a sign of mourning ) , retired to his teepee and covered his head in sorrow . His braves surrounded his tent and cut it into strips with their knives . They threatened to depose him from the chiefship unless he immediately put on the “ war-paint ” and led them against the whites . They knew that the Civil War was then in progress , that the white men were fighting among themselves , and they declared that now was the time to regain their lost hunting-grounds ; that now was the time to avenge the thievery and insults of the Agents who had for years systematically cheated them out of the greater part of their promised annuities , for which they had been induced to part with their lands ; that now was the time to avenge the debauchery of their wives and daughters by the dissolute hangers-on who , as employees of the Indian Agents and licensed traders , had for years hovered around them like buzzards around the carcasses of slaughtered buffaloes . But Little Crow was unmoved by the appeals and threats of his warriors . It is said that once for a moment he uncovered his head ; that his face was haggard and great beads of sweat stood out on his forehead . But at last one of his enraged braves , bolder than the rest , cried out : “ Ta-ó-ya-te-dú-ta is a coward ! ” Instantly Little Crow sprang from his teepee , snatched the eagle-feathers from the head of his insulter and flung them on the ground . Then , stretching himself to his full height , his eyes flashing fire , and in a voice tremulous with rage , he exclaimed : “ Ta-ó-ya-te-dú-ta is not a coward , and he is not a fool ! When did he run away from his enemies ? When did he leave his braves behind him on the war-path and turn back to his teepees ? When he ran away from your enemies , he walked behind on your trail with his face to the Ojibways and covered your backs as a she-bear covers her cubs ! Is Ta-ó-ya-te-dú-ta without scalps ? Look at his war-feathers ! Behold the scalp-locks of your enemies hanging there on his lodge-poles ! Do they call him a coward ? Ta-ó-ya-te-dú-ta is not a coward , and he is not a fool . Braves , you are like little children ; you know not what you are doing . “ You are full of the white man 's devil-water ” ( rum ) . “ You are like dogs in the Hot Moon when they run mad and snap at their own shadows . We are only little herds of buffaloes left scattered ; the great herds that once covered the prairies are no more . See !— the white men are like the locusts when they fly so thick that the whole sky is a snow-storm . You may kill one — two — ten ; yes , as many as the leaves in the forest yonder , and their brothers will not miss them . Kill one — two — ten , and ten times ten will come to kill you . Count your fingers all day long and white men with guns in their hands will come faster than you can count . “ Yes ; they fight among themselves — away off . Do you hear the thunder of their big guns ? No ; it would take you two moons to run down to where they are fighting , and all the way your path would be among white soldiers as thick as tamaracks in the swamps of the Ojibways . Yes ; they fight among themselves , but if you strike at them they will all turn on you and devour you and your women and little children just as the locusts in their time fall on the trees and devour all the leaves in one day . You are fools . You cannot see the face of your chief ; your eyes are full of smoke . You cannot hear his voice ; your ears are full of roaring waters . Braves , you are little children — you are fools . You will die like the rabbits when the hungry wolves hunt them in the Hard Moon ( January ) .

Wabashaw is a corrupt pronunciation . The name is a contraction of Wâ-pa-hâ-sa , which is from Wâ-ha-pa , the standard or pole used in the Dakota dances and upon which feathers of various colors are tied , and not from Wâ-pa — leaf , as has been generally supposed . Therefore Wâpasa means the Standard — and not the “ Leaf-Shaker , ” as many writers have it . The principal village of these hereditary chiefs was Ke-úk-sa , or Ke-ó-sa ,— where now stands the fair city of Winona . Ke-úk-sa signifies — The village of law-breakers ; so called because this band broke the law or custom of the Dakotas against marrying blood relatives of any degree . I get this information from Rev . Stephen R. Riggs , author of the Dakota Grammar and Dictionary , “ Takoo Wakan , ” etc .

The Hóhés are called “ Stone-roasters , ” because , until recently at least , they used wa-ta-pe kettles and vessels made of birch bark in which they cooked their food . They boiled water in these vessels by heating stones and putting them in the water . The wa-ta-pe kettle is made of the fibrous roots of the white cedar interlaced and tightly woven .

Heyóka is universally feared and reverenced by the Dakotas , but so severe is the ordeal that the Heyóka Wacipee ( the dance to Heyóka ) is now rarely celebrated .

The Indians term it Wakonteebe , that is , the Dwelling of the Great Spirit . The entrance into it is about ten feet wide , the height of it five feet , the arch within is near fifteen feet high and about thirty feet broad . The bottom of it consists of fine clear sand . About twenty feet from the entrance begins a lake , the water of which is transparent , and extends to an unsearchable distance ; for the darkness of the cave prevents all attempts to acquire a knowledge of it . I threw a small pebble toward the interior parts of it with my utmost strength . I could hear that it fell into the water , and notwithstanding it was of so small a size it caused an astonishing and horrible noise that reverberated through all those gloomy regions . I found in this cave many Indian hieroglyphics which appeared very ancient , for time had nearly covered them with moss so that it was with difficulty I could trace them . They were cut in a rude manner upon the inside of the walls , which were composed of a stone so extremely soft that it might be easily penetrated with a knife : a stone everywhere to be found near the Mississippi . This cave is only accessible by ascending a narrow , steep passage that lies near the brink of the river .

The Unktéhee sometimes reveals himself in the form of a huge buffalo-bull . From him proceed invisible influences . The Great Unktéhee created the earth . “ Assembling in grand conclave all the aquatic tribes he ordered them to bring up dirt from beneath the waters , and proclaimed death to the disobedient . The beaver and otter forfeited their lives . At last the muskrat went beneath the waters , and , after a long time , appeared at the surface , nearly exhausted , with some dirt . From this Unktéhee fashioned the earth into a large circular plain . The earth being finished he took a deity , one of his own offspring , and , grinding him to powder , sprinkled it upon the earth , and this produced many worms . The worms were then collected and scattered again . They matured into infants and these were then collected and scattered and became full-grown Dakotas . The bones of the mastodon , the Dakotas think , are the bones of Unktéhees , and they preserve them with the greatest care in the medicine-bag . ” Neill 's Hist . Minn ., p. 55 .

They are twin brothers , but Anpétuwee is the more powerful . Han-yé-tuwee receives his power from his brother and obeys him . He watches over the earth while the sun sleeps . The Dakotas believe the sun is the father of life . Unlike the most of their other gods , he is beneficent and kind ; yet they worshiped him ( in the sun-dance ) in the most dreadful manner . See Riggs ’ Tahkoo Wakan , pp . 81-2 , and Catlin 's Okeepa . The moon is worshiped as the representative of the sun ; and in the great Sun-dance , which is usually held in the full of the moon , when the moon rises the dancers turn their eyes on her ( or him ) . Anpétuwee issues every morning from the lodge of Han-nán-na ( the Morning ) and begins his journey over the sky to his lodge in the land of shadows . Sometimes he walks over on the Bridge ( or path ) of the Spirits — Wanâge Ta-chán-ku ,— and sometimes he sails over the sea of the skies in his shining canoe ; but somehow , and the Dakotas do not explain how , he gets back again to the lodge of Hannánna in time to take a nap and eat his breakfast before starting anew on his journey . The Dakotas swear by the sun , “ As Anpétuwee hears me , this is true ! ” They call him Father and pray to him — “ Wakán ! Até , on-she-má-da ” — “ Sacred Spirit ,— Father , have mercy on me . ” As the Sun is the father , so they believe the Earth is the mother , of life .

The Rev . S. R . Riggs , who for forty years has been a student of Dakota customs , superstitions , etc ., says , Tâhkoo Wahkan , p. 55 , et seq . : “ The religious faith of the Dakota is not in his gods as such . It is in an intangible , mysterious something of which they are only the embodiment , and that in such measure and degree as may accord with the individual fancy of the worshiper . Each one will worship some of these divinities , and neglect or despise others , but the great object of all their worship , whatever its chosen medium , is the Ta-koo Wa-kan , which is the supernatural and mysterious . No one term can express the full meaning of the Dakota 's Wakan . It comprehends all mystery , secret power and divinity . Awe and reverence are its due , and it is as unlimited in manifestation as it is in idea . All life is Wakan ; so also is everything which exhibits power , whether in action , as the winds and drifting clouds ; or in passive endurance , as the boulder by the wayside . For even the commonest sticks and stones have a spiritual essence which must be reverenced as a manifestation of the all-pervading , mysterious power that fills the universe . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 74 ]</span>Wazi-kuté — Wah-ze-koo-tay ; literally — Pine-shooter ,— he that shoots among the pines .

The Dakotas call this game Kan-soo Koo-tay-pe — shooting plum-stones . Each stone is painted black on one side and red on the other ; on one side they grave certain figures which make the stones Wakan . They are placed in a dish and thrown up like dice . Indeed , the game is virtually a game of dice . Hennepin says : “ There are some so given to this game that they will gamble away even their great coat . Those who conduct the game cry at the top of their voices when they rattle the platter , and they strike their shoulders so hard as to leave them all black with the blows . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 78 ]</span>Wa-tanka — contraction of Wa-kan Tanka — Great Spirit . The Dakotas had no Wakan Tanka or Wakan-peta — fire spirit — till white men imported them . There being no name for the Supreme Being in the Dakota tongue ( except Tâku Skán-skán .— See note 51 ) — and all their gods and spirits being Wakan — the missionaries named God in Dakota — “ Wakan Tanka ” — which means Big Spirit , or The Big Mysterious .<span type="note_anchor">[ 79 ]</span>The Dakotas called Lake Calhoun , at Minneapolis , Minn .— Mdé-mdó-za — Loon Lake . They also called it Re-ya-ta-mde — the lake back from the river . They called Lake Harriet — Mdé-únma — the other lake — or ( perhaps ) Mdé-uma — Hazel-nut Lake . The lake nearest Calhoun on the north — Lake of the Isles — they called Wi-ta Mdé — Island-Lake . Lake Minnetonka they called Me-ne-a-tân-ka — Broad Water .<span type="note_anchor">[ 80 ]</span>The animal called by the French voyageurs the cabri ( the kid ) is found only on the prairies . It is of the goat kind , smaller than a deer and so swift that neither horse nor dog can overtake it . ( Snelling 's “ Tales of the Northwest , ” p. 286 , note 15 . ) It is the gazelle , or prairie antelope , called by the Dakotas Ta-tóka-dan — little antelope . It is the Pish-tah-te-koosh of the Algonkin tribes , “ reckoned the fleetest animal in the prairie country about the Assiniboin . ” Captivity and Adventures of John Tanner , p. 301 .<span type="note_anchor">[ 81 ]</span>The Wicâstâpi Wakânpi ( literally , men supernatural ) are the “ Medicine-men ” or Magicians of the Dakotas . They call themselves the sons or disciples of Unktéhee . In their rites , ceremonies , tricks and pretensions they closely resemble the Dactyli , Idæ , and Curetes of the ancient Greeks and Romans , the Magi of the Persians and the Druids of Britain . Their pretended intercourse with spirits , their powers of magic and divination , and their rites are substantially the same , and point unmistakably to a common origin . The Dakota “ Medicine-Man ” can do the “ rope trick ” of the Hindoo magician to perfection . The teepee used for the Wakan Wacipee — or Sacred Dance — is called the Wakan Teepee — the Sacred Teepee . Carvers Cave at St. Paul was also called Wakan Teepee because the Medicine-men or magicians often held their dances and feasts in it . For a full account of the rites , etc ., see Riggs ’ Tahkoo Wahkan , Chapter VI . The Ta-sha-ke — literally , “ Deer-hoofs ” — is a rattle made by hanging the hard segments of deer-hoofs to a wooden rod a foot long — about an inch in diameter at the handle end , and tapering to a point at the other . The clashing of these horny bits makes a sharp , shrill sound something like distant sleigh-bells . In their incantations over the sick they sometimes use the gourd shell rattle . The Chân-che-ga — is a drum or “ Wooden Kettle . ” The hoop of the drum is from a foot to eighteen inches in diameter , and from three to ten inches deep . The skin covering is stretched over one end , making a drum with one end only . The magical drum-sticks are ornamented with down , and heads of birds or animals are carved on them . This makes them Wakan . The flute called Cho-tanka ( big pith ) is of two varieties — one made of sumac , the pith of which is punched out . The second variety is made of the long bone of the wing or thigh of the swan or crane . They call the first the bubbling chotanka from the tremulous note it gives when blown with all the holes stopped . Riggs ’ Tâhkoo Wahkan , p. 476 , et seq . E-né-pee — vapor-bath , is used as a purification preparatory to the sacred feasts . The vapor-bath is taken in this way : “ A number of poles , the size of hoop-poles or less , are taken , and their larger ends being set in the ground in a circle , the flexible tops are bent over and tied in the center . This frame-work is then covered with robes and blankets , a small hole being left on one side for an entrance . Before the door a fire is built , and round stones about the size of a man 's head , are heated in it . When hot they are rolled within , and the door being closed steam is made by pouring water on them . The devotee , stripped to the skin , sits within this steam-tight dome , sweating profusely at every pore , until he is nearly suffocated . Sometimes a number engage in it together and unite their prayers and songs . ” Tâhkoo Wakan , p. 83 . Father Hennepin was subjected to the vapor-bath at Mille Lacs by Chief Aqui-pa-que-tin , two hundred years ago . After describing the method , Hennepin says : “ When he had made me sweat thus three times in a week , I felt as strong as ever . ” Shea 's Hennepin , p. 228 . For a very full and accurate account of the Medicine-men of the Dakotas , and their rites , etc ., see Chap . II , Neill 's Hist . Minnesota .<span type="note_anchor">[ 82 ]</span>The sacred O-zu-ha — or Medicine sack must be made of the skin of the otter , the coon , the weasel , the squirrel , the loon , a certain kind of fish or the skins of serpents . It must contain four kinds of medicine ( or magic ) representing birds , beasts , herbs and trees , viz . : The down of the female swan colored red , the roots of certain grasses , bark from the roots of cedar trees , and hair of the buffalo . “ From this combination proceeds a Wakân influence so powerful that no human being , unassisted , can resist it . ” Wonderful indeed must be the magic power of these Dakota Druids to lead such a man as the Rev . S. R . Riggs to say of them : “ By great shrewdness , untiring industry , and more or less of actual demoniacal possession , they convince great numbers of their fellows , and in the process are convinced themselves of their sacred character and office . ” Tâhkoo Wakân , pp . 88-9 .<span type="note_anchor">[ 83 ]</span>Gâh-ma-na-tek-wahk — the river of many falls — is the Ojibway name of the river commonly called Kaministiguia , near the mouth of which is situated Fort William . The view on Thunder-Bay is one of the grandest in America . Thunder-Cap , with its sleeping stone-giant , looms up into the heavens . Here Ka-be-bon-ikka — the Ojibway 's god of storms — flaps his huge wings and makes the Thunder . From this mountain he sends forth the rain , the snow , the hail , the lightning and the tempest . A vast giant , turned to stone by his magic , lies asleep at his feet . The island called by the Ojibways the Mak-i-nak ( the turtle ) from its tortoise-like shape , lifts its huge form in the distance . Some “ down-east Yankee ” called it “ Pie-island , ” from its fancied resemblance to a pumpkin pie , and the name , like all bad names , sticks . McKay 's Mountain on the mainland , a perpendicular rock more than a thousand feet high , upheaved by the throes of some vast volcano , and numerous other bold and precipitous headlands , and rock-built islands , around which roll the sapphire-blue waters of the fathomless bay , present some of the most magnificent views to be found on either continent .<span type="note_anchor">[ 84 ]</span>The Mission of the Holy Ghost — at La Pointe , on the isle Wauga-bâ-me — ( winding view ) in the beautiful bay of Cha-quam-egon — was founded by the Jesuits about the year 1660 . Father René Menard was probably the first priest at this point . After he was lost in the wilderness , Father Glaude Allouëz permanently established the mission in 1665 . The famous Father Marquette , who took Allouëz 's place , Sept. 13 , 1669 , writing to his superior , thus describes the Dakotas : “ The Nadouessi are the Iroquois of this country , beyond La Pointe , but less faithless , and never attack till attacked . Their language is entirely different from the Huron and Algonquin . They have many villages but are widely scattered . They have very extraordinary customs . They principally use the calumet . They do not speak at great feasts , and when a stranger arrives give him to eat of a wooden fork , as we would a child . All the lake tribes make war on them , but with small success . They have false oats ( wild rice ,) use little canoes , and keep their word strictly . ” Neill 's Hist . Minn ., p. III .<span type="note_anchor">[ 85 ]</span>Michâbo or Manni-bozo — the Good Spirit of the Algonkins . In autumn , in the moon of the falling leaf , ere he composes himself to his winter 's sleep , he fills his great pipe and takes a god-like smoke . The balmy clouds from his pipe float over the hills and woodland , filling the air with the haze of “ Indian Summer . ” Brinton 's Myths of the New World , p. 163 .<span type="note_anchor">[ 86 ]</span>Pronounced Kah-tháh-gah — literally , the place of waves and foam . This was the principal village of the Isantee band of Dakotas two hundred years ago , and was located at the Falls of St. Anthony , which the Dakotas called the Ha-ha ,— pronounced Rhah-rhah ,— the loud-laughing waters . The Dakotas believed that the Falls were in the center of the earth . Here dwelt the Great Unktéhee , the creator of the earth and man : and from this place a path led to the Spirit-land . DuLuth undoubtedly visited Kathâga in the year 1679 . In his “ Memoir ” ( Archives of the Ministry of the Marine ) addressed to Seignelay , 1685 , he says : “ On the 2nd of July , 1679 , I had the honor to plant his Majesty 's arms in the great village of the Nadouecioux called Izatys , where never had a Frenchman been , etc . ” Izatys is here used not as the name of the village , but as the name of the band — the Isantees . Nadouecioux was a name given the Dakotas generally by the early French traders and the Ojibways . See Shea 's Hennepin 's Description of Louisiana , pp . 203 and 375 . The villages of the Dakotas were not permanent towns . They were hardly more than camping grounds , occupied at intervals and for longer or shorter periods , as suited the convenience of the hunters ; yet there were certain places , like Mille Lacs , the Falls of St. Anthony , Kapoza ( near St. Paul ) , Remnica ( where the city of Red Wing now stands ) , and Keuxa ( or Keoza ) on the site of the city of Winona , so frequently occupied by several of the bands as to be considered their chief villages respectively . Mr. Neill , usually very accurate and painstaking , has fallen into an error in his prefatory notes to the last edition of his valuable History of Minnesota . Speaking of DuLuth , he says : “ He appears to have entered Minnesota by way of the Pigeon or St. Louis River , and to have explored where no Frenchman had been , and on July 2 , 1679 , was at Kathio ( Kathâga ) perhaps on Red Lake or Lake of the Woods , which was called ‘ the great village of the Wadouessioux , ’ one hundred and twenty leagues from the Songaskicons and Houetepons who were dwellers in the Mille Lac region . ” Now Kathâga ( Mr. Neill 's Kathio ) was located at the Falls of St. Anthony on the Mississippi as the whole current of Dakota traditions clearly shows and DuLuth 's dispatches clearly indicate . Besides , the Songaskicons and Houetepons were not and never were “ dwellers in the Mille Lac region . ” The Songaskicons ( Sissetons ) were at that time located on the Des Moines river ( in Iowa ) , and the Houetabons ( Ouadebatons ) at and around Big Stone Lake . The Isantees occupied the region lying between the mouth of the Minnesota River and Spirit Lake ( Mille Lacs ) with their principal village — Kathága — where the city of Minneapolis now stands . These facts account for the “ one hundred and twenty leagues ” as distances were roughly reckoned by the early French explorers . September 1 , 1678 , Daniel Greysolon DuLuth , a native of Lyons , France , left Quebec to explore the country of the Dakotas . “ The next year ( 1679 ) on the 2nd day of July , he caused the king 's arms to be planted in the great village of the Nadouessioux ( Dakotas ) called Kathio ” ( Kathága ) “ where no Frenchman had ever been , also at the Songaskicons and Houetabons , one hundred and twenty leagues distant from the former . * * * * On this tour he visited Mille Lacs , which he called Lake Buade , the family name of Frontenac , governor of Canada . ” Neill '' s History of Minnesota , p. 122 . This is correct , except the name of the village — Kathio , which is a misprint or perhaps an error of a copyist . It should be Kathága . DuLuth was again at the Falls of St. Anthony in 1680 and returned to Lake Superior via the Mississippi , Rum River and Mille Lacs , according to his own dispatches . Franquelin 's “ Carte de la Louisiane ” printed at Paris A. D. 1684 , from information derived from DuLuth , who visited France in 1682-3 , and conferred with the minister of the Colonies and the minister of Marine — shows the inaccuracy , as to points of compass at least , of the early French explorers . According to this map , Lake Buade ( Mille Lacs ) lies north-west of Lake Superior and Lake Pepin lies due west of it . DuLuth was afterward appointed to the command of Fort Frontenac near Niagara Falls , and died there in 1710 . The official dispatch from the Governor of Canada to the French Government is , as regards the great explorer , brief and expressive — “ Captain DuLuth is dead . He was an honest man . ” To Daniel Greysolon DuLuth , and not to Father Hennepin , whom he rescued from his captors at Mille Lacs , belongs the credit of the first exploration of Minnesota by white men . Father Hennepin was a self-conceited and self-convicted liar . Daniel Greysolon DuLuth “ was an honest man . ” NOTES TO THE SEA-GULL<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Kay-óshk is the Ojibway name for the sea-gull .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Gitchee — great ,— Gumee — sea or lake ,— Lake Superior ; also often called Ochipwè Gitchee Gúmee , Great lake ( or sea ) of the Ojibways .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>Né-mè-Shómis — my grandfather . “ In the days of my grandfather ” is the Ojibway 's preface to all his traditions and legends .<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>Waub — white — O-jeeg — fisher , ( a furred animal ) .

This beautiful allegory has been “ done into verse ” by Longfellow in Hiawatha . Longfellow evidently took his version from Schoolcraft . I took mine originally from the lips of Pah-go-nay-gie-shiek — “ Hole-in-the-day ” — ( the elder ) in his day head-chief of the Ojibways . I afterward submitted it to Gitche Shabásh-Konk , head-chief of the Misse-sah-ga-é-gun — ( Mille Lacs band of Ojibways ) , who pronounced it correct . “ Hole-in-the-day , ” although sanctioned by years of unchallenged use , is a bad translation of Pah-go-nay-gie-shiek , which means a clear spot in the sky . [ Illustration : HOLE-IN-THE-DAY . From an original photograph in the author 's possession . ] He was a very intelligent man ; had been in Washington several times on business connected with his people , and was always shrewd enough to look out for himself in all his treaties and transactions with the Government . He stood six feet two inches in his moccasins , was well-proportioned , and had a remarkably fine face . He had a nickname — Que-we-zánc — ( Little Boy ) by which he was familiarly called by his people . The Pillagers — Nah-kánd-tway-we-nin-ni-wak — who live about Leech Lake ( Kah-sah-gah-squah-g-me-cock ) were opposed to Pa-go-nay-gie-shiek , but he compelled them through fear to recognize him as Head-Chief . At the time of the “ Sioux outbreak ” in 1862 “ Hole-in-the-day ” for a time apparently meditated an alliance with the Po-áh-nuck ( Dakotas ) and war upon the whites . The Pillagers and some other bands urged him strongly to this course , and his supremacy as head-chief was threatened unless he complied . Messengers from the Dakotas were undoubtedly received by him , and he , for a time at least , led the Dakotas to believe that their hereditary enemies , the Ojibways , would bury the hatchet and join them in a war of extermination against the whites . “ Hole-in-the-day , ” with a band of his warriors , appeared opposite Fort Ripley ( situated on the west bank of the Mississippi River between Little Falls and Crow Wing ) , and assumed a threatening attitude toward the fort , then garrisoned by volunteer troops . The soldiers were drawn up on the right bank and “ Hole-in-the-day ” and his warriors on the left . A little speech-making settled the matter for the time being and very soon thereafter a new treaty was made with “ Hole-in-the-day ” and his head men , by which their friendship and allegiance were secured to the whites . It was claimed by the Pillagers that “ Hole-in-the-day ” seized the occasion to profit personally in his negotiations with the agents of the Government . In 1867 “ Hole-in-the-day ” took “ another wife . ” He married Helen McCarty , a white woman , in Washington , D. C ., and took her to his home at Gull Lake ( Ka-ga-ya-skúnc-cock ) literally , plenty of little gulls . She bore him a son who is known as Joseph H. Woodbury , and now ( 1891 ) resides in the city of Minneapolis . His marriage with a white woman increased the hatred of the Pillagers , and they shot him from ambush and killed him near Ninge-tá-we-de-guá-yonk — Crow Wing — on the 27th day of June , 1868 . At the time of his death , “ Hole-in-the-day ” was only thirty-seven years old but had been recognized as Head-Chief for a long time . He could speak some English , and was far above the average of white men in native shrewdness and intelligence . He was thoroughly posted in the traditions and legends of his people . The Ojibways have for many years been cursed by contact with the worst elements of the whites , and seem to have adopted the vices rather than the virtues of civilization . I once spoke of this to “ Hole-in-the-day . ” His reply was terse and truthful — “ Mádgè tche-mó-ko-mon , mádgè a-nische-nábé : menógé tche-mó-ko-mon , menó a-nischè-nábè .— Bad white men , bad Indians : good white men , good Indians . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 20 ]</span>Nah — look , see .
