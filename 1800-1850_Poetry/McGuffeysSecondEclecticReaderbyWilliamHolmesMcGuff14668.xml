    <head>Preface</head>
    <p n="1">In this book , as well as in the others of the Revised Series , most of the favorite drill selections , which constituted one of the leading excellences of MCGUFFEY 'S READERS , have been retained . New selections have been inserted only when they seemed manifest improvements on those formerly used .</p>
    <p n="2">The plan of this Reader is a continuation and extension of that pursued in the First Reader .</p>
    <p n="3">If the pupil is not familiar with the diacritical marks , he should be carefully drilled , as suggested on page 7 , until the marked letter instantly suggests the correct sound . He is then prepared to study his reading lessons without any assistance from the teacher .</p>
    <p n="4">All new words are given at the head of each lesson . When these are mastered , the main difficulties left for the pupil are those of expression . In the latter portion of the book the simpler derivatives ,— such as are formed by adding one or two letters ,— possessives , plurals , verbal forms , etc .,— are omitted if the primitive word has been given . In this way the pupil is gradually led to the mastery of words as ordinarily printed .</p>
    <p n="5">A few of the most usual abbreviations have been introduced ,— such as Mr ., Mrs ., etc . These should be carefully explained , not only as to their meaning and use , but as to the reason for their use .</p>
    <p n="6">Great care has been taken to have the illustrations worthy of the reputation MCGUFFEY 'S READERS have attained , and some of the foremost designers of this country have contributed to the embellishment of the book .</p>
    <p n="7">Many of these pictures will serve admirably for lessons in language , in extension and explanation of the text . The imagination of the artist has , in some cases , filled in details not found in the text .</p>

   <p>ARTICULATION .</p>
   <p>SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS. - Thorough and frequent drills on the elementary sounds are useful in correcting vicious habits of pronunciation and in strengthening the vocal organs .</p>
   <p>As a rule , only one or two sounds should be employed at one lesson . Care should be taken that the pupils observe and practice these sounds correctly in their reading .</p>

   <p>5 . With the dollar he bought a box , three brushes , and some blacking . He then went to the corner of the street , and said to every one whose boots did not look nice , “ Black your boots , sir , please ? ”</p>
   <p>6 . He was so polite that gentlemen soon began to notice him , and to let him black their boots . The first day he brought home fifty cents , which he gave to his mother to buy food with .</p>
   <p>7 . When he gave her the money , she said , as she dropped a tear of joy , “ You are a dear , good boy , Henry . I did not know how I could earn enough to buy bread with , but now I think we can manage to get along quite well , ”</p>
   <p>8 . Henry worked all the day , and went to school in the evening . He earned almost enough to support his mother and his little sister .</p>

   <p>5 . “ If I slip the basket near him , his side will be heavy , and mine light ; but if the basket is in the middle of the pole , it will be as heavy for me as it is for him .</p>
   <p>6 . “ Tom does not know this as I do . But I will not do it . It would be wrong , and I will not do what is wrong . ”</p>
   <p>7 . Then he slipped the basket quite near his own end of the pole . His load was now heavier than that of his little brother .</p>
   <p>8 . Yet he was happy ; for he felt that he had done right . Had he deceived his brother , he would not have felt at all happy .</p>

   <p>3 . She had often told Mary the evil effects of being so careless . Her books became spoiled , and her toys broken .</p>
   <p>4 . But worse than this was the growing habit of carelessness , which would be of great harm to her all her life . It would make her unhappy , and would annoy her friends .</p>
   <p>5 . One day Mary and her mother went out into their pleasant yard , to spend an hour in the open air . Mrs. Armstrong took her work with her .</p>
   <p>6 . Mary ran about and played with Dash , her pet dog , and was having a happy time .</p>
   <p>7 . But in a corner of the yard she found her nicest doll all torn and broken , and its dress covered with mud .</p>
   <p>8 . She knew , at once , that Dash had done this , and she scolded him harshly .</p>
   <p>9 . Carrying the broken doll to her mamma . she showed it to her , and could hardly keep from crying .</p>
   <p>10 . Mrs. Armstrong asked Mary if she had not left the doll on the porch where Dash could easily get it ; and Mary had to answer , “ Yes , ma'am . ”</p>
   <p>11 . “ Then you must not blame the dog , Mary , for he does not know it is wrong for him to play with your doll . I hope this will be a lesson to you hereafter , to put your things away when you are through playing . ”</p>

   <p>6 . Then the wool is thoroughly dried , the sheep are taken to the shearer ; and he cuts off the wool with a large pair of shears .</p>
   <p>7 . It is then dyed , spun , and woven into cloth .</p>
   <p>8 . In a short time , before the cold winter comes , new wool grows out on the sheep . By the corning of spring there is so much , that it must be cut off again .</p>

     <l n="1">1 . Little Patty lives in a log house near a great forest . She has no</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>3 . But how did Patty teach them to be so tame ? Patty came to the woods often , and was always so quiet and gentle that the squirrels soon found they need not be afraid of her .</p>
   <p>4 . She brought her bread and milk to eat under the trees , and was sure to leave crumbs for the squirrels .</p>
   <p>5 . When they came near , she sat very still and watched them . So , little by little , she made them her friends , till , at last , they would sit on her shoulder , and eat from her hand .</p>
   <p>6 . Squirrels build for themselves summer houses . Those are made of leaves , and sticks , and moss . They are nice and cool for summer , but would never do for the winter cold and snow .</p>
   <p>7 . So these wise little people find a hollow in an old tree . They make it warm and snug with soft moss and leaves ; and here the squirrels live all through the long winter .</p>

    <head>THE TIGER .</head>
     <l n="1">1 . The tiger is a giant cat . His body is nearly covered with black</l>
     <l n="2">stripes .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>2 . Unlike the lion , he runs so fast that the swiftest horse can not overtake him . He goes over the ground by making bounds or springs , one after another .</p>
   <p>3 . By night , as well as by day , the tiger watches for his prey . With a frightful roar , he will seize a man , and carry him off .</p>
   <p>4 . Have you ever thought what use whiskers are to cats ? Lions have great whiskers , and so have tigers and all other animals of the cat kind .</p>
   <p>5 . Whenever you find an animal with whiskers like the cat 's , you may be sure that animal steals softly among branches and thick bushes .</p>
   <p>6 . By the slightest touch on the tiger 's whiskers , he knows when there is anything in his road .</p>
   <p>7 . A few years ago , some English officers went out to hunt . When coming home from their day 's sport , they found a little tiger kitten .</p>
   <p>8 . They took it with them and tied it , with a collar and chain , to the pole of their tent . It played about , to the delight of all who saw it .</p>
   <p>9 . One evening , just as it was growing dark , they heard a sound that frightened them greatly . It was the roar of a tiger .</p>
   <p>10 . The kitten pulled at the chain , and tried to break away . With a sharp cry , it answered the voice outside .</p>
   <p>11 . All at once , a large tigress bounded into the middle of the tent . She caught her kitten by the neck , and broke the chain which bound it .</p>
   <p>12 . Then turning to the door of the tent , she dashed away as suddenly as she had come .</p>

   <p>6 . Bounce lay on the grass , watching the flies that buzzed around his nose , and catching any that came too near .</p>
   <p>7 . There were some logs floating in the river near the shore . Willie jumped upon one of them , to see if he could throw a stone across the river .</p>
   <p>8 . He drew back , and sent the stone with all his might . just as it left his hand , the log turned , and he fell into the water .</p>
   <p>9 . He was very much frightened , for he did not know how to swim , and there was no one to hear , though he called as loud as he could for help .</p>

     <l n="2">the eagle , a hooked bill and sharp claws .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>2 . His color is a dark brown , with black and white spots , and his length is from twenty to twenty-two inches . His breast is mostly white . His tail and wings are long .</p>
   <p>3 . The fishhawk is often found sitting upon a tree over a pond , or lake , or river . He is also found by the seaside .</p>
   <p>4 . He watches the fish as they swim in the water beneath him ; then he darts down suddenly and catches one of them .</p>
   <p>5 . When he catches a fish in his sharp , rough claws , he carries it off to eat , and , as he flies away with it for his dinner , an eagle sometimes meets him .</p>
   <p>6 . The eagle flies at him fiercely with his sharp bill and claws , and compels the hawk to drop the fish .</p>
   <p>7 . Then the eagle catches the fish as it falls , before it reaches the ground , and carries it off .</p>
   <p>8 . The poor fish hawk , with a loud cry , timidly flies away . He must go again to the water and catch another fish for his dinner .</p>
   <p>9 . Thus you see , that the eagle is a robber . He robs fishhawks , whose only mode of getting a living is by catching fish .</p>

    <head>WHAT THE LEAF SAID .</head>
    <head>1 . Once or twice a little leaf was heard to cry and sigh , as leaves often do , when a gentle wind is blowing . And the twig said , “ What is the matter , little leaf ? ”</head>
     <l n="1">2 . “ The wind , ” said the leaf , “ just told me that one day it would pull me</l>
     <l n="2">off , and throw me on the ground to die . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>3 . The twig told it to the branch , and the branch told it to the tree . When the tree heard it , it rustled all over , and sent word back to the trembling leaf .</p>
   <p>4 . “ Do not be afraid , ” it said ; “ hold on tight , and you shall not go off till you are ready . ”</p>
   <p>5 . So the leaf stopped sighing , and went on singing and rustling . It grew all the summer long till October . And when the bright days of autumn came , the leaf saw all the leaves around growing very beautiful .</p>
   <p>6 . Some were yellow , some were brown , and many were striped with different colors . Then the leaf asked the tree what this meant .</p>
   <p>7 . The tree said , “ All these leaves are getting ready to fly away , and they have put on these colors because of their joy . ”</p>
   <p>8 . Then the little leaf began to want to go , and grew very beautiful in thinking of it . When it was gay in colors , it saw that the branches of the tree had no bright colors on them .</p>
   <p>9 . So the leaf said , “ O branch ! why are you lead - colored while we are all beautiful and golden ? ”</p>
   <p>10 . “ We must keep on our working clothes , ” said the tree , “ for our work is not yet done ; but your clothes are for holidays , because your task is now over . ”</p>
   <p>11 . Just then a little puff of wind came , and the leaf let go without thinking , and the wind took it up and turned it over and over .</p>
   <p>12 . Then it fell gently down under the edge of the fence , among hundreds of leaves , and has never waked to tell us what it dreamed about .</p>

   <p>4 . When Jessie told her brothers this , they all talked about it a great deal . “ Such a good , kind mamma , and no Christmas present ! It 's too bad . ”</p>
   <p>5 . “ I do n't like it , ” said little Jessie , with a tear in her eye .</p>

   <p>8 . “ Well , you will be new , Jessie , ” said Joe , “ when you get back . She has not seen you for an hour . ”</p>
   <p>9 . Jessie jumped and laughed . “ Then put me in the basket , and carry me to mamma , and say , ‘ I am her Christmas present . ’ "</p>
   <p>10 . So they set her in the basket , and put green branches all around her . It was a jolly ride . They set her down on the doorstep , and went in and said , “ There 's a Christmas present out there for you , mamma . ”</p>
   <p>11 . Mamma went and looked , and there , in a basket of green branches , sat her own little laughing girl .</p>
   <p>12 . “ Just the very thing I wanted most , ” said mamma .</p>

   <p>5 . Such a funny thing happened to Lucy . She slipped on a stone , and down she went into the water . How we both laughed ! But the wind and sun soon dried Lucy 's dress .</p>
   <p>6 . Then father came and took us in the boat for a row . After that we had a picnic dinner in the woods .</p>
   <p>7 . Then father spread his coat on the grass , and took a nap while we children played on the beach .</p>

   <p>12 . When Ralph found that he could not have the white rose , he began to scream , and snatched it . But he was soon very sorry . The thorns tore his hand . It was so sore he could not use it for some time .</p>
   <p>13 . Ralph did not soon forget this . When he wanted what he should not have , his mother would point to his sore hand . He at last learned to do as he was told .</p>

     <l n="1">1 . On a summer day , a man sitting on the bank of a river , in the shade of</l>
     <l n="2">some bushes , watched a flock of ducks on the stream .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>2 . Soon a branch with leaves came drifting among them , and they all took wing . After circling in the air for a little time , they settled down again on their feeding ground .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Fox watching ducks from a distance .</p>
   </figure>
   <p>3 . Soon another branch came drifting down among them , and again they took flight from the river ; but when they found the branch had drifted by and done them no harm , they flew down to the water as before .</p>
   <p>4 . After four or five branches had drifted by in this way , the ducks gave little heed to them . At length , they hardly tried to fly out of their way , even when the branches nearly touched them .</p>
   <p>5 . The man who had been watching all this , now began to wonder who had set these branches adrift . He looked up the stream , and spied a fox slyly watching the ducks . “ What will he do next ? ” thought the man .</p>
   <p>6 . When the fox saw that the ducks were no longer afraid of the branches , he took a much larger branch than any he had yet used , and stretched himself upon it so as to be almost hidden . Then he set it afloat as he had the others .</p>
   <p>7 . Right among the flock drifted the sly old fox , and , making quick snaps to right and left , he seized two fine young ducks , and floated off with them .</p>
   <p>8 . The rest of the flock flew away in fright , and did not come back for a long time .</p>
   <p>9 . The fox must have had a fine dinner to pay him for his cunning , patient work .</p>

    <head>A GOOD OLD MAN .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">1 . There once lived an old man in a snug , little cottage . It had two</l>
     <l n="2">rooms and only two windows . A small garden lay just behind it .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">2 . Old as the poor man was , he used to work in the fields . Often he would</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">3 . And who do you think met him at the door ! Mary and Jane , his two little</l>

     <l n="7">4 . They were too young to work , except to weed in the garden , or bring</l>
     <l n="8">water from the spring .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>5 . In winter , as they were too poor to buy much wood or coal , they had little fire ; so they used to sit close together to keep warm . Mary would sit on one of the old man 's knees , and Jane on the other .</p>
   <p>6 . Sometimes their grandfather would tell them a droll story . Sometimes he would teach them a hymn .</p>
   <p>7 . He would often talk to them of their father , who had gone to sea , or of their good , kind mother , who was in her grave . Every night he prayed God to bless them , and to bring back their father in safety .</p>
   <p>8 . The old man grew weaker every year ; but the little girls were glad to work for him , who had been so good to them .</p>

   <p>9 . One cold , windy night , they heard a knock at the door . The little girls ran and opened it . Oh , joy to them ! There stood their father .</p>
   <p>10 . He had been at sea a long time . He had saved some money , and had now come home to stay .</p>
   <p>11 . After this the old man did not have to work . His son worked for him , and his grandchildren took care of him . Many happy days they spent together .</p>

   <p>THE GREEDY GIRL .</p>
   <p>1 . Laura English is a greedy little girl . Indeed , she is quite a glutton . Do you know what a glutton is ? A glutton is one who eats too much , because the food tastes well .</p>
   <p>2 . Laura 's mother is always willing she should have as much to eat as is good for her ; but sometimes , when her mother is not watching , she eats so much that it makes her sick .</p>
   <p>3 . I do not know why she is so silly . Her kitten never eats more than it needs . It leaves the nice bones on the plate , and lies down to sleep when it has eaten enough .</p>
   <p>4 . The bee is wiser than Laura . It flies all day among the flowers to gather honey , and might eat the whole time if it pleased . But it eats just enough , and carries all the rest to its hive .</p>

   <p>5 . The squirrel eats a few nuts or acorns , and frisks about as gayly as if he had dined at the king 's table .</p>
   <p>6 . Did you ever see a squirrel with a nut in his paws ? How bright and lively he looks as he eats it !</p>
   <p>7 . If he lived in a house made of acorns , he would never need a doctor . He would not eat an acorn too much .</p>
   <p>8 . I do not love little girls who eat too much . Do you , my little readers ?</p>
   <p>9 . I do not think they have such rosy cheeks , or such bright eyes , or such sweet , happy tempers as those who eat less .</p>

   <p>Sarah . Our life does not depend upon it , but our comfort does , surely . How much more time will it take to put a thing in its place , than to hunt for it or to borrow whenever you want to use it ?</p>
   <p>Mary . Well , Sarah , I will never borrow of you again , you may depend upon it .</p>
   <p>Sarah . You are not offended with me , I hope .</p>

   <p>4 . So George put on his hat , and ran into the street . As he went skipping along , he met some boys throwing snowballs . George soon engaged in the sport .</p>
   <p>5 . He sent a ball at James Mason , but it missed him , and broke a window on the other side of the street .</p>
   <p>6 . George feared some one would come out of the house and find him . So he ran off as fast as he could .</p>
   <figure>

   </figure>
   <p>7 . As soon as he got round the next corner , George stopped , because he was very sorry for what he had done .</p>
   <p>8 . He said to himself , “ I have no right to spend my silver dollar , now . I ought to go back , and pay for the glass I broke with my snowball . ”</p>
   <p>9 . He went up and down the street , and felt very sad . He wished very much to buy something nice . He also wished to pay for the broken glass .</p>
   <p>10 . At last he said , “ It was wrong to break the window , though I did not mean to do it . I will go and pay for it , if it takes all my money , I will try not to be sorry . I do not think the man will hurt me if I pay for the mischief I have done . ”</p>

    <head>FRANK AND THE HOURGLASS .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">1 . Frank was a very talkative little boy . He never saw a new thing without</l>
     <l n="2">asking a great many questions about it .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">2 . His mother was very patient and kind . When it was proper to answer his</l>
     <l n="4">questions , she would do so .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>3 . Sometimes she would say , “ You are not old enough to understand that , my son . When you are ten years old , you may ask me about it , and I will tell you . ”</p>
   <p>4 . When his mother said this , he never teased any more . He knew she always liked to answer him when he asked proper questions .</p>
   <p>5 . The first time Frank saw an hourglass , he was very much amused ; but he did not know what it was .</p>
   <p>6 . His mother said , “ An hourglass is made in the shape of the figure 8 . The sand is put in at one end , and runs through a small hole in the middle . As much sand is put into the glass as will run through in an hour . ”</p>
   <p>7 . Frank watched the little stream of sand . He was impatient , because it would not run faster . “ Let me shake it , mother , ” said he ; “ it is lazy , and will never get through . ”</p>
   <p>8 . “ Oh yes , it will , my son , ” said his mother , “ The sand moves by little and little , but it moves all the time . 9 . “ When you look at the hands of the clock , you think they go very slowly , and so they do ; but they never stop .</p>
   <p>10 , “ While you are at play the sand is running , grain by grain , The hands of the clock are moving , second by second .</p>
   <p>11 . “ At night , the sand in the hourglass has run through twelve times . The hour hand of the clock has moved all around its great face .</p>
   <p>12 . “ This because they keep work every minute . They do not stop to think how much they have to do , and how long it will take them to do it . ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">13 . Now , Frank 's mother wanted him to learn a little hymn ; but he said</l>
     <l n="2">“ Mother , I can never learn it . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">14 . His mother said , “ Study all the time . Never stop to ask how long it</l>
     <l n="4">will take to learn it . You will be able to say it very soon . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">15 . Frank followed his mother 's advice . He studied line after line , very</l>
     <l n="6">busily ; and in one hour and a half he knew the hymn perfectly .</l>

   <p>6 . “ But father is away for all day , and the men have been trying nearly an hour to catch Fanny ; one of the men says she can n't be caught . ”</p>

   <p>9 . “ It wo n't take me long , mother . Fanny will come to me , ” said Jenny , cheerily . She put on her wide straw hat , and was off in a moment , down the hill , to the field where the horse was grazing .</p>
   <p>10 . The moment Fanny heard the rustle of Jenny 's dress , she pricked up her ears , snorted , and , with head erect , seemed ready to bound away again .</p>

   <p>11 . “ Fanny ! O Fanny ! ” called Jenny , and the beautiful creature turned her head . That gentle tone she well knew , and , glad to see her friend , she carne directly to the fence , and rubbed her head on the girl 's shoulder . As soon as the gate was opened , she followed Jenny to the barn .</p>
   <p>12 . The men had treated her roughly , and she remembered it . But she knew and loved the voice that was always kind , and the hand that often fed and caressed her . She gave love for love , and willing service for kindness .</p>

    <head>POOR DAVY .</head>
     <l n="1">1 . It was recess time at the village school . The bell had rung , and the</l>
     <l n="2">children had run out into the bright sunshine , wild with laughter and fun .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>2 . All but poor Davy . He came out last and very slowly , but he did not laugh . He was in trouble , and the bright , golden sunlight did not make him glad .</p>
   <p>3 . He walked across the yard , and sat down on a stone behind the old maple . A little bird on the highest branch sang just to make him laugh .</p>
   <p>4 . But Davy did not notice it . He was thinking of the cruel words that had been said about his ragged clothes . The tears stole out of his eyes , and ran down his cheeks .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Boy sitting alone under tree in schoolyard . Other children playing in background .</p>
   </figure>
   <p>5 . Poor Davy had no father , and his mother had to work hard to keep him at school .</p>
   <p>6 . That night , he went home by the path that led across the fields and through the woods . He still felt sad .</p>
   <p>7 . Davy did not wish to trouble his mother ; so he lingered a while among the trees , and at last threw himself on the green moss under them .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Woman talking to boy .</p>
   </figure>
   <p>8 . Just then his teacher came along . She saw who it was , and stopped , saying kindly , “ What is the matter , Davy ? ”</p>
   <p>9 . He did not speak , but the tears began again to start .</p>
   <p>10 . “ Wo n't you tell me ? Perhaps I can help you . ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">11 . Then he told her all his trouble . When he ended , she said , cheerily ,</l>
     <l n="2">“ I have a plan , Davy , that I think will help you . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">12 . “ Oh , what is it ? ” he said , sitting up with a look of hope , while a</l>

     <l n="7">get my flowers ? ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>15 . “ Right in these woods , and in the fields , ” said his teacher . " Here are lovely blue violets , down by the brook are white ones , and among the rocks are ferns and mosses . Bring them all to my house , and I will help you arrange them . ”</p>
   <p>16 . So , day after day , Davy hunted the woods for the prettiest flowers , and the most dainty ferns and mosses . After his teacher had helped to arrange them , he took them to the city that was near , and sold them .</p>
   <p>17 . He soon earned money enough to buy new clothes . Now the sunshine and the bird 's songs make him glad .</p>

   <p>2 . Soon the tiny flakes floated softly down , like flocks of little white birds . Faster and faster they came , till they filled the air . They made no noise , but they were busy all night long .</p>

   <p>5 . The old corn basket that was left out by the barn , upside down , they made into a cunning little snow house with a round roof .</p>
   <p>6 . When the busy little flakes had done their work , the sun came up to see what they had been about .</p>
   <p>7 . He must have been pleased with what he saw , for he smiled such a bright , sweet smile , that the whole white world sparkled as if it were made of little stars .</p>

    <head>BESSIE .</head>
    <head>1 . One day , Bessie thought how nice it would be to have a garden with only wild flowers in it . So into the house she ran to find her Aunt Annie , and ask her leave to go over on the shady hillside , across the brook , where the wild flowers grew thickest .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">[ Illustration : Girl planting small garden . Toad sitting in garden . ]</l>

     <l n="2">2 . " Yes , indeed , you may go , ” said Aunt Annie ; “ but what will you put the</l>
     <l n="3">roots and earth in while you are making the garden ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">3 . “ Oh , ” said Bessie , “ I can take my apron . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>4 . Her aunt laughed , and said , “ A basket will be better , I think . ” So they looked in the closets and the attic , everywhere ; but some of the baskets were full , and some broken ; not one could they find that would do .</p>
   <p>5 . Then Aunt Annie turned out the spools and the bags from a nice large workbasket , and gave that to Bessie . “ You may have this for your own , ” she said , “ to fill with earth , or flowers , or anything you like . ”</p>
   <p>6 . “ Oh I thank you , ” said Bessie , and she danced away through the garden . She slipped through the gate , out into the field all starred with dandelions , down in the hollow by the brook , then up on the hillside out of sight among the shady trees .</p>
   <p>7 . How she worked that afternoon ! She heaped up the dark , rich earth , and smoothed it over with her hands . Then she dug up violets , and spring-beauties , and other flowers ,— running back and forth , singing all the while .</p>
   <p>8 . The squirrels peeped out of their holes at Bessie . The birds sang in the branches overhead . Thump , came something all at once into the middle of the bed . Bessie jumped and upset the basket , and away it rolled down the hill .</p>
   <p>9 . How Bessie laughed when she saw a big , brown toad winking his bright eyes at her , as if he would say , “ No offense , I hope . ”</p>
   <p>10 . Just then Bessie heard a bell ringing loudly . She knew it was calling her home ; but how could she leave her basket ? She must look for that first .</p>
   <p>11 . “ Waiting , waiting , waiting , ” all at once sang a bird out of sight among the branches ; “ waiting , Bessie . ”</p>
   <p>12 . “ Sure enough , ” said Bessie ; “ perhaps I 'm making dear mother or auntie wait ; and they are so good to me . I 'd better let the basket wait . Take care of it , birdie ; and do n't jump on my flowers , Mr. Toad . ”</p>

   <p>2 . “ I , dear , ” said her mother . “ I am going away for a long visit , and if you had not come at once , I could not have said good-by to my little girl . ”</p>
   <p>3 . Then Bessie 's mother kissed her , and told her to obey her kind aunt while she was gone .</p>
   <p>4 . The next morning , Bessie waked to find it raining hard . She went into her aunt 's room with a very sad face . “ O auntie ! this old rain ! ”</p>
   <p>5 , “ This new , fresh , beautiful rain , Bessie ! How it will make our flowers grow , and what a good time we can have together in the house ! ”</p>
   <p>6 . “ I know it , auntie ; but you will think me so careless ! ”</p>
   <p>7 . “ To let it rain ? ”</p>
   <p>8 . “ No ; do n't laugh , Aunt Annie ; to leave your nice basket out of doors all night ; and now it will be soaked and ruined in this — this — beautiful rain . ” Bessie did not look as if the beautiful rain made her very happy .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">9 . “ You must be more careful , dear , another time , ” said her aunt , gently .</l>
     <l n="2">“ But come , tell me all about it . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>10 . So Bessie crept very close to her auntie 's side , and told her of her happy time the day before ; of the squirrel , and the toad , and how the basket rolled away down the hill ; and then how the bell rang , and she could not stop to find the basket .</p>
   <p>11 . “ And you did quite right , ” said her aunt . “ If you had stopped , your mother must have waited a whole day , or else gone without seeing you . When I write , I will tell her how obedient you were , and that will please her more than anything else I can say . ”</p>
