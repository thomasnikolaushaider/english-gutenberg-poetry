    <docTitle><titlePart>LIFE OF EDWARD FITZGERALD .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>Edward FitzGerald was born in the year<date>1809</date>, at Bredfield House , near Woodbridge , Suffolk , being the third son of John Purcell , who , subsequently to his marriage with a Miss FitzGerald , assumed the name and arms proper to his wife 's family . St. Germain and<settlement>Paris</settlement>were in turn the home of his earlier years , but in<date>1821</date>, he was sent to the Grammar School at Bury St. Edmunds . During his stay in that ancient foundation he was the fellow pupil of James Spedding and J. M. Kemble . From there he went in<date>1826</date>to Trinity College ,<settlement>Cambridge</settlement>, where he made the acquaintance of W. M. Thackeray and others of only less note . His school and college friendships were destined to prove lasting , as were , also , all those he was yet to form . One of FitzGerald 's chief characteristics was what might almost be called a genius for friendship . He did not , indeed , wear his heart upon his sleeve , but ties once formed were never unloosed by any failure in charitable and tender affection on his part . Never , throughout a lengthy life , did irritability and erratic petulance ( displayed ‘ tis true , at times by the translator of “ that large infidel ” ) , darken the eyes of those he honoured with his friendship to the simple and whole-hearted genuineness of the man . From<settlement>Oxford</settlement>, FitzGerald retired to the ‘ suburb grange ’ at Woodbridge , referred to by Tennyson . Here , narrowing his bodily wants to within the limits of a Pythagorean fare , he led a life of a truly simple type surrounded by books and roses , and , as ever , by a few firm friends . Annual visits to<settlement>London</settlement>in the months of Spring kept alive the alliances of earlier days , and secured for him yet other intimates , notably the Tennyson brothers . Amongst the languages , Spanish seems to have been his earlier love . His translation of Calderon , due to obedience to the guiding impulse of Professor Cowell , showed him to the world as a master of the rarest of arts , that of conveying to an English audience the lights and shades of a poem first fashioned in a foreign tongue . At the bidding of the same mentor , he , later , turned his attention to Persian , the first fruits of his toil being an anonymous version , in Miltonic verse , of the ‘ SalÃ ¡ mÃ ¡ n and AbsÃ ¡ l ’ of JÃ ¡ mi . Soon after , the treasure-house of the Bodleian library yielded up to him the pearl of his literary endeavour , the verses of “ Omar KhayyÃ ¡ m , ” a pearl whose dazzling charm previously had been revealed to but few , and that through the medium of a version published in<settlement>Paris</settlement>by Monsieur Nicolas . FitzGerald 's hasty and ill-advised union with Lucy , daughter of Bernard Barton , the Quaker poet and friend of Lamb , was but short-lived , and demands no comment . They agreed to part . In later life , most summers found the poet on board his yacht “ The Scandal ” ( so-called as being the staple product of the neighbourhood ) in company with ‘ Posh ’ as he dubbed Fletcher , the fisherman of Aldeburgh , whose correspondence with FitzGerald has lately been given to the world . To the end he loved the sea , his books , his roses and his friends , and that end came to him , when on a visit with his friend Crabbe , with all the kindliness of sudden death , on the 14th June ,<date>1883</date>. Besides the works already mentioned , FitzGerald was the author of “ Euphranor ”<span type="note_anchor">[<date>1851</date>]</span>, a Platonic Dialogue on Youth ; “ Polonius ": a Collection of Wise Saws and Modern Instances<span type="note_anchor">[<date>1852</date>]</span>; and translations of the “ Agamemnon ” of Ã  schylus<span type="note_anchor">[<date>1865</date>]</span>; and the “ Å  dipus Tyrannus ” and “ Å  dipus Coloneus ” of Sophocles . Of these translations the “ Agamemnon ” probably ranks next to the RubÃ ¡ iyÃ ¡ t in merit . To the six dramas of Calderon , issued in<date>1853</date>, there were added two more in<date>1865</date>. Of these plays , “ Vida es Sueno ” and “ El Magico Prodigioso ” possess especial merit . His “ RubÃ ¡ iyÃ ¡ t of Omar KhayyÃ ¡ m ” was first issued anonymously on January 15th ,<date>1859</date>, but it caused no great stir , and , half-forgotten , was reintroduced to the notice of the literary world in the following year by Rossetti , and , in this connection , it is curious to note to what a large extent Rossetti played the part of a literary Lucina . FitzGerald , Blake and Wells are all indebted to him for timely aid in the reanimation of offspring , that seemed doomed to survive but for a short time the pangs that gave them birth . Mr. Swinburne and Lord Houghton were also impressed by its merits , and its fame slowly spread . Eight years elapsed , however , before the publication of the second edition . After the passage of a quarter-of-a-century a considerable stimulus was given to the popularity of the “ RubÃ ¡ iyÃ ¡ t ” by the fact that Tennysonâ  appropriately enough in view of FitzGerald 's translation of Sophocles ’ “ Å  dipus " â  prefaced his “ Tiresias , and other Poems , ” with some charmingly reminiscent lines written to “ Old Fitz ” on his last birthday . “ This , ” says Mr. Edmund Gosse , “ was but the signal for that universal appreciation of ‘ Omar KhayyÃ ¡ m ’ in his English dress , which has been one of the curious literary phenomena of recent years . The melody of FitzGerald 's verse is so exquisite , the thoughts he rearranges and strings together are so profound , and the general atmosphere of poetry in which he steeps his version is so pure , that no surprise need be expressed at the universal favour which the poem has met with among critical readers . ” Neither the “ RubÃ ¡ iyÃ ¡ t ” nor his other works are mere translations . They are better , perhaps , described as consisting of “ largely new work based on the nominal originals . ” In the “ Omar , ” admittedly the highest in quality of his works , he undoubtedly took considerable liberties with his author , and introduced lines , or even entire quatrains , which , however they may breathe the spirit of the original , have no material counterpart therein . In illustration of FitzGerald 's capacity for conveying the spirit rather than the very words of the original , comparison of the Ousely MS. of<date>1460</date>A. D ., in the Bodleian Library at<settlement>Oxford</settlement>, with the “ RubÃ ¡ iyÃ ¡ t ” as we know it , is of great interest . The MS. runs thus : â  For a while , when young , we frequented a teacher ; For a while we were contented with our proficiency ; Behold the foundation of the discourse ! â  what happened to us ? We came in like Water , and we depart like Wind . In FitzGerald 's version the verses appear thus : â  Myself when young did eagerly frequent Doctor and Saint and heard great Argument About it and about : but evermore Came out by the same Door as in I went . With them the Seed of Wisdom did I sow And with my own hand labour 'd it to grow : And this was all the Harvest that I reap'dâ  “ I came like Water , and like Wind I go . ” Similar examples may be found elsewhere , thus : â  From the Beginning was written what shall be Unhaltingly the Pen writes , and is heedless of good and bad ; On the First Day He appointed everything that must be , Our grief and our efforts are vain , develops into : â  The Moving Finger writes ; and , having writ , Moves on : nor all thy Piety nor Wit Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line , Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it . The general tendency to amplification is shown again in the translation of the two lines : â  Forsake not the book , the lover 's lips and the green bank of the field , Ere that the earth enfold thee in its bosom . into the oft-quoted verses : â  With me along some Strip of Herbage strown That just divides the desert from the sown , Where the name of Slave and SultÃ ¡ n scarce is known , And pity SultÃ ¡ n MÃ ¡ hmÃºd on his Throne . Here with a Loaf of Bread beneath the Bough , A Flask of Wine , a Book of Verseâ  and Thou Beside me singing in the Wildernessâ  And Wilderness is Paradise enow ! And in the lines of Omar : â  In a thousand places on the road I walk , thou placest snares . Thou sayest : “ I will catch thee if thou steppeth into them , ” In no smallest thing is the world independent of thee , Thou orderest all thingsâ  and callest me rebellious ! majestically shaping into FitzGerald 's rendering : â  Oh , Thou , who didst with Pitfall and with Gin Beset the Road I was to wander in , Thou wilt not with Predestination round Enmesh me , and impute my Fall to Sin ? Oh , Thou , who Man of baser Earth didst make And who with Eden didst devise the Snake ; For all the Sin wherewith the Face of Man Is blacken 'd , Man 's Forgiveness giveâ  and take ! To what school did FitzGerald belong ? Who were his literary progenitors ? Lucretius , Horace and Donne , at any rate , had a considerable share in moulding his thought and fashioning the form of his verse . The unrhymed line , so often but by no means uniformly resounding with a suspended clangour that is not caught up by the following stanza is distinctly reminiscent of the Alcaics of Horace . Epicurean , in the ordinary sense of the term , he certainly is , but it is of the earlier type . Cyrenaic would be a juster epithet , the “ carpe diem ” doctrine of the poem is too gross and sensual to have commended itself to the real Epicurus . Intense fatalism , side by side with complete agnosticism , this is the keynote of the poem . Theoretically incompatible , these two “ isms ” are in practice inevitable companions . The theory of reincarnation and that alone , can furnish a full explanation of FitzGerald 's splendid success as a translator . Omar was FitzGerald and FitzGerald was Omar . Both threw away their shields and retired to their tent , not indeed to sulk , but to seek in meditative aloofness , the calm and content that is the proper reward of those alone who persevere to the end . Retirement brought them all it could bring , a yet deeper sense of the vanity of things and their unknowableness . Herein for the mass of mankind lies the charm of the RubÃ ¡ iyÃ ¡ t , in clear , tuneful numbers it chants the half-beliefs and disbeliefs of those who are neither demons nor saints , neither theological dogmatists nor devil-worshippers , but men . Those seeking further information as to the life and place in literature of Edward FitzGerald are referred to Jackson 's “ FitzGerald and Omar KhayyÃ ¡ m ”<span type="note_anchor">[<date>1899</date>]</span>; Clyde 's “ Life of FitzGerald ”<span type="note_anchor">[<date>1900</date>]</span>; Tutin 's “ Concordance to FitzGerald 's Omar KhayyÃ ¡ m ”<span type="note_anchor">[<date>1900</date>]</span>; and Prideaux 's “ Notes for a Bibliography of FitzGerald ”<span type="note_anchor">[<date>1901</date>]</span>, and his “ Life ”<span type="note_anchor">[<date>1903</date>]</span>.

    <body>
     <p>Omar KhayyÃ ¡ m , or Chiam , was born about the middle of the 11th Century , at NaishÃ ¡ pÃºr , KhorassÃ ¡ n , and he died in that town about the year 1123 .</p>
     <p>Little is known as to the details of his life , and such facts as are available have been drawn principally from the WasÃ ­ yat or Testament of Mizam al Mulk ( Regulation of the Realm ) , who was a fellow-pupil of Omar at the school of the celebrated ImÃ ¡ m Mowafek or Mowaffak . Reference to this is made in Mirkhond 's History of the Assassins , from which the following extract [ A ] is taken .</p>
     <p>“ ‘ One of the greatest of the wise men of KhorassÃ ¡ n was the ImÃ ¡ n Mowaffak of NaishÃ ¡ pÃºr , a man highly honoured and reverenced , â  may God rejoice his soul ; his illustrious years exceeded eighty-five , and it was the universal belief that every boy who read the Koran , or studied the traditions in his presence , would assuredly attain to honour and happiness . For this cause did my father send me from TÃºs to NaishÃ ¡ pÃºr with Abd-u-samad , the doctor of law , that I might employ myself in study and learning under the guidance of that illustrious teacher . Towards me he ever turned an eye of favour and kindness , and as his pupil I felt for him extreme affection and devotion , so that I passed four years in his service . When I first came there , I found two other pupils of mine own age newly arrived , Hakim Omar KhayyÃ ¡ m and the ill-fated Ben SabbÃ ¡ h . Both were endowed with sharpness of wit and the highest natural powers ; and we three formed a close friendship together . When the ImÃ ¡ m rose from his lectures , they used to join me , and we repeated to each other the lessons we had heard . Now Omar was a native of NaishÃ ¡ pÃºr , while Hasan Ben SabbÃ ¡ h 's father was one Ali , a man of austere life and practice , but heretical in his creed and doctrine . One day Hasan said to me and to KhayyÃ ¡ m , “ It is a universal belief that the pupils of the ImÃ ¡ m Mowaffak will attain to fortune . Now , if we all do not attain thereto , without doubt one of us will ; what then shall be our mutual pledge and bond ? ” We answered , “ Be it what you please . ” “ Well , ” he said , “ let us make a vow , that to whomsoever this fortune falls , he shall share it equally with the rest , and reserve no pre-eminence for himself . ” “ Be it so , ” we both replied ; and on those terms we mutually pledged our words . Years rolled on , and I went from KhorassÃ ¡ n to Transoxiana , and wandered to Ghazni and Cabul ; and when I returned , I was invested with office , and rose to be administrator of affairs during the Sultanate of Sultan Alp ArslÃ ¡ n . ’</p>
     <p>“ He goes on to state , that years passed by , and both his old school-friends found him out , and came and claimed a share in his good fortune according to the school-day vow . The Vizier was generous and kept his word . Hasan demanded a place in the government , which the Sultan granted at the Vizier 's request ; but , discontented with a gradual rise , he plunged into the maze of intrigue of an Oriental Court , and , failing in a base attempt to supplant his benefactor , he was disgraced and fell . After many mishaps and wanderings , Hasan became the head of the Persian sect of the IsmaÃ ­ lians , â  a party of fanatics who had long murmured in obscurity , but rose to an evil eminence under the guidance of his strong and evil will . In A. D. 1090 he seized the castle of AlamÃºt , in the province of RÃºdbar , which lies in the mountainous tract , south of the Caspian sea ; and it was from this mountain home he obtained that evil celebrity among the Crusaders , as the OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAINS , and spread terror through the Mohammedan world ; and it is yet disputed whether the word Assassin , which they have left in the language of modern Europe as their dark memorial , is derived from the hashish , or opiate of hemp-leaves ( the Indian bhang ) , with which they maddened themselves to the sullen pitch of oriental desperation , or from the name of the founder of the dynasty , whom we have seen in his quiet collegiate days , at NaishÃ ¡ pÃºr . One of the countless victims of the Assassin 's dagger was NizÃ ¡ m al Mulk himself , the old school-boy friend .</p>
     <p>“ Omar KhayyÃ ¡ m also came to the Vizier to claim his share ; but not to ask for title or office . ‘ The greatest boon you can confer on me , ’ he said , ‘ is to let me live in a corner under the shadow of your fortune , to spread wide the advantages of Science , and pray for your long life and prosperity . ’ The Vizier tells us , that when he found Omar was really sincere in his refusal , he pressed him no further , but granted him a yearly pension of 1 , 200 mithkÃ ¡ ls of gold from the treasury of NaishÃ ¡ pÃºr .</p>
     <p>“ At NaishÃ ¡ pÃºr thus lived and died Omar KhayyÃ ¡ m , ‘ busied , ’ adds the Vizier , ‘ in winning knowledge of every kind , and especially in Astronomy , wherein he attained to a very high pre-eminence . Under the Sultanate of Malik Shah , he came to Merv , and obtained great praise for his proficiency in science , and the Sultan showered favours upon him . ’</p>
     <p>“ When Malik Shah determined to reform the calendar , Omar was one of the eight learned men employed to do it ; the result was the JalÃ ¡ li era ( so-called from Jalal-ul-Din , one of the king 's names ) â ' a computation of time , ’ says Gibbon , ‘ which surpasses the Julian , and approaches the accuracy of the Gregorian style . ’ He is also the author of some astronomical tables , entitled ‘ ZÃ ­ ji-MalikshÃ ¡ hÃ ­, ’ and the French have lately republished and translated an Arabic treatise of his on Algebra .</p>
     <p>“ These severe Studies , and his verses , which , though happily fewer than any Persian Poet 's , and , though perhaps fugitively composed , the Result of no fugitive Emotion or Thought , are probably the Work and Event of his Life , leaving little else to record . Perhaps he liked a little Farming too , so often as he speaks of the ‘ Edge of the Tilth ’ on which he loved to rest with his DiwÃ ¡ n of Verse , his Loafâ  and his Wine .</p>
     <p>“ His Takhallus or poetical name ( KhayyÃ ¡ m ) signifies a Tent-maker , and he is said to have at one time exercised that trade , perhaps before NizÃ ¡ m al Mulk 's generosity raised him to independence . Many Persian poets similarly derive their names from their occupations : thus we have AttÃ ¡ r ‘ a druggist , ’ AssÃ ¡ r ‘ an oil presser , ’ etc . Omar himself alludes to his name in the following whimsical lines : â </p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ ‘ KhayyÃ ¡ m , who stitched the tents of science ,</l>
       <l n="2">Has fallen in grief 's furnace and been suddenly burned ;</l>
       <l n="3">The shears of Fate have cut the tent ropes of his life ,</l>
       <l n="4">And the broker of Hope has sold him for nothing ! ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ We have only one more anecdote to give of his Life , and that relates to the close ; related in the anonymous preface which is sometimes prefixed to his poems ; it has been printed in the Persian in the appendix to Hyde 's Veterum Persarum Religio , p. 449 ; and D'Herbelot alludes to it in his BibliothÃ © que , under Khiam [ B ]: â </p>
     <p>“ ‘ It is written in the chronicles of the ancients that this King of the Wise , Omar KhayyÃ ¡ m , died at NaishÃ ¡ pÃºr in the year of the Hegira , 517 ( A. D. 1123 ) ; in science he was unrivalled , â  the very paragon of his age . KhwÃ ¡ jah NizÃ ¡ mi of Samarcand , who was one of his pupils , relates the following story : “ I often used to hold conversation with my teacher , Omar KhayyÃ ¡ m , in a garden ; and one day he said to me , ‘ My tomb shall be in a spot where the north wind may scatter roses over it . ’ I wondered at the words he spake , but I knew that his were no idle words . Years after , when I chanced to revisit NaishÃ ¡ pÃºr I went to his final resting place , and lo ! it was just outside a garden , and trees laden with fruit stretched their boughs over the garden wall , and dropped their flowers upon his tomb , so as the stone was hidden under them . " ’ ”</p>
     <lg>

       <l n="1">Much discussion has arisen in regard to the meaning of Omar 's poetry .</l>
       <l n="2">Some writers have insisted on a mystical interpretation and M. Nicholas</l>
       <l n="3">goes so far as to state his opinion that Omar devoted himself “ avec</l>
       <l n="4">passion Ã l'Ã © tude de la philosphie des Soufis . ” On the other hand Von</l>
       <l n="5">Hammer , the author of a History of the Assassins , refers to Omar as a</l>
       <l n="6">Freethinker and a great opponent of Sufism .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">Probably , in the absence of agreement amongst authorities , the soundest</l>
       <l n="8">view is that expressed by FitzGerald 's editor , [ C ] that the real Omar</l>
       <l n="9">KhayyÃ ¡ m was a Philosopher , of scientific insight and ability far beyond</l>
       <l n="10">that of the Age and Country he lived in ; of such moderate and worldly</l>
       <l n="11">Ambition as becomes a Philosopher , and such moderate wants as rarely</l>
       <l n="12">satisfy a Debauchee ; that while the Wine Omar celebrates is simply the</l>
       <l n="13">Juice of the Grape , he bragged more than he drank of it , in very</l>
       <l n="14">defiance perhaps of that Spiritual Wine which left its Votaries sunk in</l>
       <l n="15">Hypocrisy or Disgust .</l>

     </lg>
     <p>To Baron Von Hammer-Purgstall , who died in Vienna in 1856 , we owe our best knowledge of the Persians . He has translated into German , besides the “ Divan ” of Hafiz , specimens of two hundred poets , who wrote during a period of five and a half centuries , from A. D. 1050 to 1600 . The seven masters of the Persian Parnassusâ  Firdousi , Enweri , Nisami , Dschelaleddin , Saadi , Hafiz , and Dschami [ D ] â  have ceased to be empty names ; and others , like Ferideddin Attar and Omar Chiam , promise to rise in Western estimation . That for which mainly books exist is communicated in these rich extracts . Many qualities go to make a good telescope , â  as the largeness of the field , facility of sweeping the meridian , achromatic purity of lenses , and so forth , â  but the one eminent value is the space penetrating power ; and there are many virtues in books , â  but the essential value is the adding of knowledge to our stock , by the record of new facts , and , better , by the record of intuitions , which distribute facts , and are the formulas which supersede all histories .</p>
     <p>Oriental life and society , especially in the Southern nations , stand in violent contrast with the multitudinous detail , the secular stability , and the vast average of comfort of the Western nations . Life in the East is fierce , short , hazardous , and in extremes . Its elements are few and simple , not exhibiting the long range and undulation of European existence , but rapidly reaching the best and the worst . The rich feed on fruits and game , â  the poor on a watermelon 's peel . All or nothing is the genius of Oriental life . Favour of the Sultan , or his displeasure , is a question of Fate . A war is undertaken for an epigram or a distich , as in Europe for a duchy . The prolific sun , and the sudden and rank plenty which his heat engenders , make subsistence easy . On the other side , the desert , the simoom , the mirage , the lion , and the plague endanger it , and life hangs on the contingency of a skin of water more or less . The very geography of old Persia showed these contrasts . “ My father 's empire , ” said Cyrus to Xenophon , “ is so large , that people perish with cold , at one extremity , whilst they are suffocated with heat , at the other . ” The temperament of the people agrees with this life in extremes . Religion and poetry are all their civilization . The religion teaches an inexorable Destiny . It distinguishes only two days in each man 's historyâ  his birthday , called the Day of the Lot , and the Day of Judgment . Courage and absolute submission to what is appointed him are his virtues .</p>
     <p>The favour of the climate making subsistence easy and encouraging an outdoor life , allows to the Eastern nations a highly intellectual organization , â  leaving out of view , at present , the genius of the Hindoos ( more Oriental in every sense ) , whom no people have surpassed in the grandeur of their ethical statement . The Persians and the Arabs , with great leisure and few books , are exquisitely sensible to the pleasures of poetry . Layard has given some details of the effect which the improvvisatori produced on the children of the desert . “ When the bard improvised an amatory ditty , the young chief 's excitement was almost beyond control . The other Bedouins were scarcely less moved by these rude measures , which have the same kind of effect on the wild tribes of the Persian mountains . Such verses , chanted by their self-taught poets , or by the girls of their encampment , will drive warriors to the combat , fearless of death , or prove an ample reward , on their return from the dangers of the ghazon , or the fight . The excitement they produce exceeds that of the grape . He who would understand the influence of the Homeric ballads in the heroic ages should witness the effect which similar compositions have upon the wild nomads of the East . ” Elsewhere he adds , “ Poetry and flowers are the wine and spirits of the Arab ; a couplet is equal to a bottle , and a rose to a dram , without the evil effect of either . ”</p>
     <p>The Persian poetry rests on a mythology whose few legends are connected with the Jewish history , and the anterior traditions of the Pentateuch . The principal figure in the allusions of Eastern poetry is Solomon . Solomon had three talismans ; first , the signet-ring , by which he commanded the spirits , on the stone of which was engraven the name of God ; second , the glass , in which he saw the secrets of his enemies , and the causes of all things , figured ; the third , the east-wind , which was his horse . His counsellor was Simorg , king of birds , the all-wise fowl , who had lived ever since the beginning of the world , and now lives alone on the highest summit of Mount Kaf . No fowler has taken him , and none now living has seen him . By him Solomon was taught the language of birds , so that he heard secrets whenever he went into his gardens . When Solomon travelled , the throne was placed on a carpet of green silk , of a length and breadth sufficient for all his army to stand upon , â  men placing themselves on his right hand , and the spirits on his left . When all were in order , the east-wind , at his command , took up the carpet and transported it , with all that were upon it , whither he pleased , â  the army of birds at the same time flying overhead , and forming a canopy to shade them from the sun . It is related that when the Queen of Sheba came to visit Solomon , he had built , against her arrival , a palace , of which the floor or pavement was of glass , laid over running water , in which fish were swimming . The Queen of Sheba was deceived thereby , and raised her robes , thinking she was to pass through the water . On the occasion of Solomon 's marriage , all the beasts , laden with presents , appeared before his throne . Behind them all came the ant , with a blade of grass : Solomon did not despise the gift of the ant . Asaph , the vizier , at a certain time , lost the seal of Solomon , which one of the Dews , or evil spirits , found , and , governing in the name of Solomon , deceived the people .</p>
     <p>Firdousi , the Persian Homer , has written in the Shah Nameh the annals of the fabulous and heroic kings of the country : of Karum ( the Persian CrÅ  sus ) , the immeasurably rich gold-maker , who , with all his treasures , lies buried not far from the Pyramids , in the sea which bears his name ; of Jamschid , the binder of demons , whose reign lasted seven hundred years ; of Kai Kaus , in whose palace , built by demons on Alburz , gold and silver and precious stones were used so lavishly , that in the brilliancy produced by their combined effect , night and day appeared the same ; of Afrasiyab , strong as an elephant , whose shadow extended for miles , whose heart was bounteous as the ocean , and his hands like the clouds when rain falls to gladden the earth . The crocodile in the rolling stream had no safety from Afrasiyab . Yet when he came to fight against the generals of Kaus , he was but an insect in the grasp of Rustem , who seized him by the girdle , and dragged him from his horse . Rustem felt such anger at the arrogance of the King of Mazinderan , that every hair on his body started up like a spear . The gripe of his hand cracked the sinews of an enemy .</p>
     <p>These legends , â  with Chiser , the fountain of life , Tuba , the tree of life , â  the romances of the loves of Leila and Medschun , of Chosru and Schirin , and those of the nightingale for the rose , â  pearl-diving , and the virtues of gems , â  the cohol , the cosmetic by which pearls and eyebrows are indelibly stained black , â  the bladder in which musk is brought , â  the down of the lip , the mole on the cheek , the eyelash , â  lilies , roses , tulips and jasmines , â  make the staple imagery of Persian odes .</p>
     <p>The Persians have epics and tales , but , for the most part , they affect short poems and epigrams . Gnomic verses , rules of life conveyed in a lively image , especially in an image addressed to the eye , and contained in a single stanza , were always current in the East ; and if the poem is long , it is only a string of unconnected verses . They use an inconsecutiveness quite alarming to Western logic , and the connection between the stanzas of their longer odes is much like that between the refrain of our old English ballads ,</p>
     <p>“ The sun shines fair on Carlisle wall , ”</p>
     <p>or</p>
     <p>“ The rain it raineth every day , ”</p>
     <p>and the main story .</p>
     <p>Take , as specimens of these gnomic verses , the following : â </p>

     <p>Hafiz is the prince of Persian poets , and in his extraordinary gifts adds to some of the attributes of Pindar , Anacreon , Horace , and Burns the insight of a mystic , that sometimes affords a deeper glance at Nature than belongs to either of these bards . He accosts all topics with an easy audacity . “ He only , ” he says , “ is fit for company , who knows how to prize earthly happiness at the value of a nightcap . Our father Adam sold Paradise for two kernels of wheat ; then blame me not if I hold it dear at one grapestone . ” He says to the Shah , “ Thou who rulest after words and thoughts which no ear has heard and no mind has thought , abide firm until thy young destiny tears off his blue coat from the old graybeard of the sky . ” He says : â </p>

     <p>After the manner of his nation , he abounds in pregnant sentences which might be engraved on a sword-blade and almost on a ring . “ In honour dies he to whom the great seems ever wonderful . ” “ Here is the sum , that , when one door opens , another shuts . ” “ On every side is an ambush laid by the robber-troops of circumstance ; hence it is that the horseman of life urges on his courser at headlong speed . ” “ The earth is a host who murders his guests . ” “ Good is what goes on the road of Nature . On the straight way the traveller never misses . ”</p>

     <p>That hardihood and self-equality of every sound nature , which result from the feeling that the spirit in him is entire and as good as the world , which entitle the poet to speak with authority , and make him an object of interest , and his every phrase and syllable significant , are in Hafiz , and abundantly fortify and ennoble his tone .</p>
     <p>His was the fluent mind in which every thought and feeling came readily to the lips . “ Loose the knots of the heart , ” he says . We absorb elements enough , but have not leaves and lungs for healthy perspiration and growth . An air of sterility , of incompetence to their proper aims , belongs to many who have both experience and wisdom . But a large utterance , a river that makes its own shores , quick perception and corresponding expression , a constitution to which every morrow is a new day , which is equal to the needs of life , at once tender and bold , with great arteries , â  this generosity of ebb and flow satisfies , and we should be willing to die when our time comes , having had our swing and gratification . The difference is not so much in the quality of men 's thoughts as in the power of uttering them . What is pent and smouldered in the dumb actor is not pent in the poet , but passes over into new form , at once relief and creation .</p>
     <p>The other merit of Hafiz is his intellectual liberty , which is a certificate of profound thought . We accept the religions and politics into which we fall ; and it is only a few delicate spirits who are sufficient to see that the whole web of convention is the imbecility of those whom it entangles , â  that the mind suffers no religion and no empire but its own . It indicates this respect to absolute truth by the use it makes of the symbols that are most stable and reverend , and therefore is always provoking the accusation of irreligion .</p>
     <p>Hypocrisy is the perpetual butt of his arrows .</p>
     <p>“ Let us draw the cowl through the brook of wine . ”</p>
     <p>He tells his mistress that not the dervis , or the monk , but the lover , has in his heart the spirit which makes the ascetic and the saint ; and certainly not their cowls and mummeries , but her glances , can impart to him the fire and virtue needful for such self-denial . Wrong shall not be wrong to Hafiz , for the name 's sake . A law or statute is to him what a fence is to a nimble school-boy , â  a temptation for a jump . “ We would do nothing but good , else would shame come to us on the day when the soul must hie hence ; and should they then deny us Paradise , the Houris themselves would forsake that , and come out to us . ”</p>
     <p>His complete intellectual emancipation he communicates to the reader . There is no example of such facility of allusion , such use of all materials . Nothing is too high , nothing too low , for his occasion . He fears nothing , he stops for nothing . Love is a leveller , and Allah becomes a groom , and heaven a closet , in his daring hymns to his mistress or to his cupbearer . This boundless charter is the right of genius .</p>
     <p>We do not wish to strew sugar on bottled spiders , or try to make mystical divinity out of the Song of Solomon , much less out of the erotic and bacchanalian songs of Hafiz . Hafiz himself is determined to defy all such hypocritical interpretation , and tears off his turban and throws it at the head of the meddling dervis , and throws his glass after the turban . But the love or the wine of Hafiz is not to be confounded with vulgar debauch . It is the spirit in which the song is written that imports , and not the topics . Hafiz praises wine , roses , maidens , boys , birds , mornings , and music , to give vent to his immense hilarity and sympathy with every form of beauty and joy ; and lays the emphasis on these to mark his scorn of sanctimony and base prudence . These are the natural topics and language of his wit and perception . But it is the play of wit and the joy of song that he loves ; and if you mistake him for a low rioter , he turns short on you with verses which express the poverty of sensual joys , and to ejaculate with equal fire the most unpalatable affirmations of heroic sentiment and contempt for the world . Sometimes it is a glance from the height of thought , as thus : â " Bring wine ; for , in the audience-hall of the soul 's independence , what is sentinel or Sultan ? what is the wise man or the intoxicated ? ” And sometimes his feast , feasters , and world are only one pebble more in the eternal vortex and revolution of Fate : â </p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ I am ; what I am</l>
       <l n="2">My dust will be again . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>A saint might lend an ear to the riotous fun of Falstaff ; for it is not created to excite the animal appetites , but to vent the joy of a supernal intelligence . In all poetry , Pindar 's rule holds , â  Ï  Ï Î½ÎµÏ  Î ¿ á ¿ Ï  Ï  Ï  Î½Îµá½ ·, it speaks to the intelligent ; and Hafiz is a poet for poets , whether he write , as sometimes , with a parrot 's , or , as at other times , with an eagle 's quill .</p>
     <p>Every song of Hafiz affords new proof of the unimportance of your subject to success , provided only the treatment be cordial . In general , what is more tedious than dedications or panegyrics addressed to grandees ? Yet in the “ Divan ” you would not skip them , since his muse seldom supports him better .</p>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>the verses came to the ear of Timour in his palace . Timour taxed Hafiz with treating disrespectfully his two cities , to raise and adorn which he had conquered nations . Hafiz replied , “ Alas , my lord , if I had not been so prodigal , I had not been so poor ! ”</p>
     <p>The Persians had a mode of establishing copyright the most secure of any contrivance with which we are acquainted . The law of the ghaselle , or shorter ode , requires that the poet insert his name in the last stanza . Almost every one of several hundreds of poems of Hafiz contains his name thus interwoven more or less closely with the subject of the piece . It is itself a test of skill , as this self-naming is not quite easy . We remember but two or three examples in English poetry ; that of Chaucer , in the “ House of Fame ": Jonson 's epitaph on his son , â </p>

     <p>and Cowley 's , â </p>
     <p>“ The melancholy Cowley lay . ”</p>
     <p>But it is easy to Hafiz . It gives him the opportunity of the most playful self-assertion , always gracefully , sometimes almost in the fun of Falstaff , sometimes with feminine delicacy . He tells us , “ The angels in heaven were lately learning his last pieces . ” He says , “ The fishes shed their pearls , out of desire and longing as soon as the ship of Hafiz swims the deep . ”</p>

Thou hast indeed seen the temple ; but I , the Lord of the temple . Nor has any man inhaled from the musk-bladder of the merchant , or from the musky morning-wind , that sweet air which I am permitted to breathe every hour of the day . ” And with still more vigour in the following lines : â </p>

     <p>And his claim has been admitted from the first . The muleteers and camel-drivers , on their way through the desert , sing snatches of his songs , not so much for the thought , as for their joyful temper and tone ; and the cultivated Persians know his poems by heart . Yet Hafiz does not appear to have set any great value on his songs , since his scholars collected them for the first time after his death .</p>

     <p>Ferideddin Attar wrote the “ Bird Conversations , ” a mystical tale in which the birds coming together to choose their king , resolve on a pilgrimage to Mount Kaf , to pay their homage to the Simorg . From this poem , written five hundred years ago , we cite the following passage , as a proof of the identity of mysticism in all periods . The tone is quite modern . In the fable , the birds were soon weary of the length and difficulties of the way , and at last almost all gave out . Three only persevered , and arrived before the throne of the Simorg .</p>

       <l n="1">“ The bird-soul was ashamed ;</l>
       <l n="2">Their body was quite annihilated ;</l>
       <l n="3">They had cleaned themselves from the dust ,</l>
       <l n="4">And were by the light ensouled .</l>
       <l n="5">What was , and was not , â  the Past , â </l>
       <l n="6">Was wiped out from their breast .</l>
       <l n="7">The sun from near-by beamed</l>
       <l n="8">Clearest light into their soul ;</l>
       <l n="9">The resplendence of the Simorg beamed</l>
       <l n="10">As one back from all three .</l>
       <l n="11">They knew not , amazed , if they</l>
       <l n="12">Were either this or that .</l>
       <l n="13">They saw themselves all as Simorg ,</l>
       <l n="14">Themselves in the eternal Simorg .</l>
       <l n="15">When to the Simorg up they looked ,</l>
       <l n="16">They beheld him among themselves ;</l>
       <l n="17">And when they looked on each other</l>
       <l n="18">They saw themselves in the Simorg .</l>
       <l n="19">A single look grouped the two parties ,</l>
       <l n="20">The Simorg emerged , the Simorg vanished ,</l>
       <l n="21">This in that , and that in this ,</l>
       <l n="22">As the world has never heard .</l>
       <l n="23">So remained they , sunk in wonder ,</l>
       <l n="24">Thoughtless in deepest thinking ,</l>
       <l n="25">And quite unconscious of themselves .</l>
       <l n="26">Speechless prayed they to the Highest</l>
       <l n="27">To open this secret ,</l>
       <l n="28">And to unlock Thou and We .</l>
       <l n="29">There came an answer without tongue. â </l>
       <l n="30">‘ The Highest is a sun-mirror ;</l>
       <l n="31">Who comes to Him sees himself therein ,</l>
       <l n="32">Sees body and soul , and soul and body ;</l>
       <l n="33">When you came to the Simorg ,</l>
       <l n="34">Three therein appeared to you ,</l>
       <l n="35">And , had fifty of you come ,</l>
       <l n="36">So had you seen yourselves as many .</l>
       <l n="37">Him has none of us yet seen .</l>
       <l n="38">Ants see not the Pleiades .</l>
       <l n="39">Can the gnat grasp with his teeth</l>
       <l n="40">The body of the elephant ?</l>
       <l n="41">What you see is He not ;</l>
       <l n="42">What you hear is He not .</l>
       <l n="43">The valleys which you traverse ,</l>
       <l n="44">The actions which you perform ,</l>
       <l n="45">They lie under our treatment</l>
       <l n="46">And among our properties</l>
       <l n="47">You as three birds are amazed ,</l>
       <l n="48">Impatient , heartless , confused :</l>
       <l n="49">Far over you am I raised ,</l>
       <l n="50">Since I am in act Simorg .</l>
       <l n="51">Ye blot out my highest being ,</l>
       <l n="52">That ye may find yourselves on my throne ;</l>
       <l n="53">For ever ye blot out yourselves ,</l>
       <l n="54">As shadows in the sun . Farewell ! ’ ”</l>
