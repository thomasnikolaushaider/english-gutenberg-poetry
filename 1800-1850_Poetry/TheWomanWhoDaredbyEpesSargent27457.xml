    <docImprint>UNIVERSITY PRESS : WELCH , BIGELOW , &amp; CO .,<settlement>CAMBRIDGE</settlement>. To —— ——. Spring saw my little venture just begun ; And then your hospitable message came , Inviting me to taste the strawberries At Strawberry Hill . I went . How long I stayed , Urged by dear friends and the restoring breeze , Let me not say ; long enough to complete My rhythmic structure ; day by day it grew , And all sweet influences helped its growth . The lawn sloped green and ample till the trees Met on its margin ; and the Hudson 's tide Rolled beautiful beyond , where purple gleams Fell on the Palisades or touched the hills Of the opposing shore ; for all without Was but an emblem of the symmetry I found within , where love held perfect sway , With taste and beauty and domestic peace For its allies . We do not praise the rose , Since all who see it know it is the rose ; And so , dear lady , praise of thee would seem , To all who know thee , quite superfluous . But if from any of these thoughts be shed Aught of the fragrance and the hue of truth , To thee I dedicate the transient flower In which the eternal beauty reappears ; Knowing , should poison mingle with the sweet , Thou , like the eclectic bee , with instinct sure , Wilt take the good alone , and leave the bad .</docImprint>

    <head>OVERTURE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Blest Power that canst transfigure common things ,</l>
     <l n="2">And , like the sun , make the clod burst in bloom ,—</l>
     <l n="3">Unseal the fount so mute this many a day ,</l>
     <l n="4">And help me sing of Linda ! Why of her ,</l>
     <l n="5">Since she would shrink with manifest recoil ,</l>
     <l n="6">Knew she that deeds of hers were made a theme</l>
     <l n="7">For measured verse ? Why leave the garden flowers</l>
     <l n="8">To fix the eye on one poor violet</l>
     <l n="9">That on the solitary grove sheds fragrance ?</l>
     <l n="10">Themes are enough , that court a wide regard ,</l>
     <l n="11">And prompt a strenuous flight ; and yet from all ,</l>
     <l n="12">My thoughts come back to Linda . Let me spare ,</l>
     <l n="13">As best I may , her modest privacy ,</l>
     <l n="14">While under Fancy 's not inapt disguise</l>
     <l n="15">I give substantial truth , and deal with no</l>
     <l n="16">Unreal beings or fantastic facts :</l>
     <l n="17">Bear witness to it , Linda !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="18">Now while May</l>
     <l n="19">Keeps me a restive prisoner in the house ,</l>
     <l n="20">For the first time the Spring 's unkindness ever</l>
     <l n="21">Held me aloof from her companionship ,</l>
     <l n="22">However roughly from the east her breath</l>
     <l n="23">Came as if all the icebergs of Grand Bank</l>
     <l n="24">Were giving up their forms in that one gust ,—</l>
     <l n="25">Now while on orchard-trees the struggling blossoms</l>
     <l n="26">Break from the varnished cerements , and in clouds</l>
     <l n="27">Of pink and white float round the boughs that hold</l>
     <l n="28">Their verdure yet in check ,— and while the lawn</l>
     <l n="29">Lures from yon hemlock hedge the robin , plump</l>
     <l n="30">And copper-breasted , and the west wind brings</l>
     <l n="31">Mildness and balm ,— let me attempt the task</l>
     <l n="32">That also is a pastime .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="33">What though Spring</l>
     <l n="34">Brings not of Youth the wonder and the zest ;</l>
     <l n="35">The hopes , the day-dreams , and the exultations ?</l>
     <l n="36">The animal life whose overflow and waste</l>
     <l n="37">Would far out-measure now our little hoard ?</l>
     <l n="38">The health that made mere physical existence</l>
     <l n="39">An ample joy ; that on the ocean beach</l>
     <l n="40">Shared with the leaping waves their breezy glee ;</l>
     <l n="41">That in deep woods , or in forsaken clearings ,</l>
     <l n="42">Where the charred logs were hid by verdure new ,</l>
     <l n="43">And the shy wood-thrush lighted ; or on hills</l>
     <l n="44">Whence counties lay outspread beneath our gaze ;</l>
     <l n="45">Or by some rock-girt lake where sandy margins</l>
     <l n="46">Sloped to the mirrored tints of waving trees ,—</l>
     <l n="47">Could feel no burden in the grasshopper ,</l>
     <l n="48">And no unrest in the long summer day ?</l>
     <l n="49">Would I esteem Youth 's fervors fair return</l>
     <l n="50">For temperate airs that fan sublimer heights</l>
     <l n="51">Than Youth could scale ; heights whence the patient vision</l>
     <l n="52">May see this life 's harsh inequalities ,</l>
     <l n="53">Its rudimental good and full-blown evil ,</l>
     <l n="54">Its crimes and earthquakes and insanities ,</l>
     <l n="55">And all the wrongs and sorrows that perplex us ,</l>
     <l n="56">Assume , beneath the eternal calm , the order</l>
     <l n="57">Which can come only from a Love Divine ?</l>
     <l n="58">A love that sees the good beyond the evil ,</l>
     <l n="59">The serial life beyond the eclipsing death ,—</l>
     <l n="60">That tracks the spirit through eternities ,</l>
     <l n="61">Backward and forward , and in every germ</l>
     <l n="62">Beholds its past , its present , and its future ,</l>
     <l n="63">At every stage beholds it gravitate</l>
     <l n="64">Where it belongs , and thence new-born emerge</l>
     <l n="65">Into new life and opportunity ,</l>
     <l n="66">An outcast never from the assiduous Mercy ,</l>
     <l n="67">Providing for His teeming universe ,</l>
     <l n="68">Divinely perfect not because complete ,</l>
     <l n="69">But because incomplete , advancing ever</l>
     <l n="70">Beneath the care Supreme ?— heights whence the soul ,</l>
     <l n="71">Uplifted from all speculative fog ,</l>
     <l n="72">All darkening doctrine , all confusing fear ,</l>
     <l n="73">Can see the drifted plants , can scent the odors ,</l>
     <l n="74">That surely come from that celestial shore</l>
     <l n="75">To which we tend ; however out of reckoning ,</l>
     <l n="76">Swept wrong by Error 's currents , Passion 's storms ,</l>
     <l n="77">The poor tossed bark may be ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="78">Descend , my thoughts !</l>
     <l n="79">Your theme lies lowly as the ground-bird 's nest ;</l>
     <l n="80">Why seek , with wings so feeble and unused ,</l>
     <l n="81">To soar above the clouds and front the stars ?</l>
     <l n="82">Descend from your high venture , and to scenes</l>
     <l n="83">Of the heart 's common history come down !</l>
    </lg>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE FATHER 'S STORY .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The little mansion had its fill of sunshine ;</l>
     <l n="2">The western windows overlooked the Hudson</l>
     <l n="3">Where the great city 's traffic vexed the tide ;</l>
     <l n="4">The front received the Orient 's early flush .</l>
     <l n="5">Here dwelt three beings , who the neighbors said</l>
     <l n="6">Were husband , wife , and daughter ; and indeed</l>
     <l n="7">There was no sign that they were otherwise .</l>
     <l n="8">Their name was Percival ; they lived secluded ,</l>
     <l n="9">Saw no society , except some poor</l>
     <l n="10">Old pensioner who came for food or help ;</l>
     <l n="11">Though , when fair days invited , they would take</l>
     <l n="12">The omnibus and go to see the paintings</l>
     <l n="13">At the Academy ; or hear the music</l>
     <l n="14">At opera or concert ; then , in summer ,</l>
     <l n="15">A visit to the seaside or the hills</l>
     <l n="16">Would oft entice them .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="17">Percival had reached</l>
     <l n="18">His threescore years and five , but stood erect</l>
     <l n="19">As if no touch of age had chilled him yet .</l>
     <l n="20">Simple in habit , studious how to live</l>
     <l n="21">In best conformity with laws divine ,—</l>
     <l n="22">Impulsive , yet by trial taught to question</l>
     <l n="23">All impulses , affections , appetites ,</l>
     <l n="24">At Reason 's bar ,— two objects paramount</l>
     <l n="25">Seemed steadily before him ; one , to find</l>
     <l n="26">The eternal truth , showing the constant right</l>
     <l n="27">In politics , in social life , in morals ,—</l>
     <l n="28">The other , to apply all love and wisdom</l>
     <l n="29">To education of his child — of Linda .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="30">Yet , if with eye anointed , you could look</l>
     <l n="31">On that benign and tranquil countenance ,</l>
     <l n="32">You might detect the lines which Passion leaves</l>
     <l n="33">Long after its volcano is extinct</l>
     <l n="34">And flowers conceal its lava . Percival</l>
     <l n="35">Was older than his consort , twenty years ;</l>
     <l n="36">Yet were they fitly mated ; though , with her ,</l>
     <l n="37">Time had dealt very gently , leaving face</l>
     <l n="38">And rounded form still youthful , and unmarred</l>
     <l n="39">By one uncomely outline ; hardly mingling</l>
     <l n="40">A thread of silver in her chestnut hair</l>
     <l n="41">That affluent needed no deceiving braid .</l>
     <l n="42">Framed for maternity the matron seemed :</l>
     <l n="43">Thrice had she been a mother ; but the children ,</l>
     <l n="44">The first six winters of her union brought ,</l>
     <l n="45">A boy and girl , were lost to her at once</l>
     <l n="46">By a wall 's falling on them , as they went ,</l>
     <l n="47">Heedless of danger , hand in hand , to school .</l>
     <l n="48">To either parent terrible the blow !</l>
     <l n="49">But , three years afterward , when Linda came ,</l>
     <l n="50">With her dark azure eyes and golden hair ,</l>
     <l n="51">It was as if a healing angel touched</l>
     <l n="52">The parents ’ wound , and turned their desolation</l>
     <l n="53">Into a present paradise , revealing</l>
     <l n="54">Two dear ones , beckoning from the spirit-land ,</l>
     <l n="55">And one , detaining them , with infant grasp ,</l>
     <l n="56">Feeble , yet how resistless ! here below .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="57">And so there was great comfort in that household :</l>
     <l n="58">And those unwhispered longings both had felt</l>
     <l n="59">At times , that they might pass to other scenes</l>
     <l n="60">Where Love would find its own , were felt no more :</l>
     <l n="61">For Linda grew in beauty every day ;</l>
     <l n="62">Beauty not only of the outward mould ,</l>
     <l n="63">Sparkling in those dear eyes , and on the wind</l>
     <l n="64">Tossing those locks of gold , but beauty born ,</l>
     <l n="65">In revelations flitting o'er the face ,</l>
     <l n="66">From the soul 's inner symmetry ; from love</l>
     <l n="67">Too deep and pure to utter , had she words ;</l>
     <l n="68">From the divine desire to know ; to prove</l>
     <l n="69">All objects brought within her dawning ken ;</l>
     <l n="70">From frolic mirth , not heedless but most apt ;</l>
     <l n="71">From sense of conscience , shown in little things</l>
     <l n="72">So early ; and from infant courtesy</l>
     <l n="73">Charming and debonair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="74">The parents said ,</l>
     <l n="75">While the glad tears shone brimming in their eyes ,</l>
     <l n="76">“ Oh ! lacking love and best experience</l>
     <l n="77">Are those who tell us that the purity</l>
     <l n="78">And innocence of childhood are delusion ;</l>
     <l n="79">Or that , so far as they exist , they show</l>
     <l n="80">The absence of all mind ; no impulses</l>
     <l n="81">Save those of selfish passion moving it !</l>
     <l n="82">And that , by nature desperately wicked ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></l>
     <l n="83">The child learns good through evil ; having no</l>
     <l n="84">Innate ideas , no inborn will , no bias .</l>
     <l n="85">Here , in this infant , is our confutation !</l>
     <l n="86">O self-sufficing physiologist ,</l>
     <l n="87">Who , grubbing in the earth , hast missed the stars ,</l>
     <l n="88">We ask no other answer to thy creed</l>
     <l n="89">Than this , the answer heaven and earth supply . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="90">Now sixteen summers had our Linda seen ,</l>
     <l n="91">And grown to be a fair-haired , winsome maid ,</l>
     <l n="92">In shape and aspect promising to be</l>
     <l n="93">A softened repetition of her mother ;</l>
     <l n="94">And yet some traits from the paternal side</l>
     <l n="95">Gave to the head an intellectual grace</l>
     <l n="96">And to the liquid eyes a power reserved ,</l>
     <l n="97">Brooding awhile in tender gloom , and then</l>
     <l n="98">Flashing emotion , as some lofty thought ,</l>
     <l n="99">Some sight of pity , or some generous deed ,</l>
     <l n="100">Kindled a ready sympathy whose tears</l>
     <l n="101">Fell on no barren purpose ; for with Linda</l>
     <l n="102">To feel , to be uplifted , was to act ;</l>
     <l n="103">Her sorest trials being when she found</l>
     <l n="104">How far the wish to do outran the power .</l>
     <l n="105">Often would Percival observe his child ,</l>
     <l n="106">And study to divine if in the future</l>
     <l n="107">Of that organization , when mature ,</l>
     <l n="108">There should prevail the elements that lead</l>
     <l n="109">Woman to find the crowning charm of life</l>
     <l n="110">In the affections of a happy marriage ,</l>
     <l n="111">Or if with satisfactions of the mind</l>
     <l n="112">And the æsthetic faculty , the aims</l>
     <l n="113">Of art and letters , the pursuits of trade ,</l>
     <l n="114">Linda might find the fresh activities</l>
     <l n="115">He craved for her , and which forecasting care</l>
     <l n="116">Might possibly provide .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="117">His means were small ,</l>
     <l n="118">Merged in a life-annuity which gave</l>
     <l n="119">All that he held as indispensable</l>
     <l n="120">To sanative conditions in a home :</l>
     <l n="121">Good air , good influences , proper food .</l>
     <l n="122">By making his old wardrobe do long service</l>
     <l n="123">He saved the wherewith to get faithful help</l>
     <l n="124">From the best teachers in instructing Linda ;</l>
     <l n="125">And she was still the object uppermost .</l>
     <l n="126">Dawned the day fair , for Linda it was fair ,</l>
     <l n="127">And they all three could ramble in the Park .</l>
     <l n="128">If on Broadway the ripe fruit tempted him ,</l>
     <l n="129">Linda was fond of fruit ; those grapes will do</l>
     <l n="130">For Linda . Was the music rich and rare ?</l>
     <l n="131">Linda must hear it . Were the paintings grand ?</l>
     <l n="132">Linda must see them . So the important thought</l>
     <l n="133">Was always Linda ; and the mother shared</l>
     <l n="134">In all this fond parental providence ;</l>
     <l n="135">For in her tender pride in the dear girl</l>
     <l n="136">There was no room for any selfish thought ,</l>
     <l n="137">For any jealous balancing of dues .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="138">“ My child , ” said Percival , one summer day ,</l>
     <l n="139">As he brought in a bunch of snow-white roses ,</l>
     <l n="140">Ringed with carnations , many-leafed and fragrant ,</l>
     <l n="141">“ Take it , an offering for your birthday ; this</l>
     <l n="142">Is June the twelfth , a happy day for me . ”</l>
     <l n="143">“ How fresh , how beautiful ! ” said Linda rising</l>
     <l n="144">And kissing him on either cheek . “ Dear father ,</l>
     <l n="145">You spoil me for all other care , I fear ,</l>
     <l n="146">Since none can be like yours . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="147">“ Why speak of that ? ”</l>
     <l n="148">He with a start exclaimed ; “ my care must be</l>
     <l n="149">Prolonged till I can see you safely fixed</l>

     <l n="36">“ Not destitute , my father ! ” Linda cried ;</l>
     <l n="37">“ Far back as thought can go , you taught me this :</l>
     <l n="38">To help myself ; to seek , in my own mind ,</l>
     <l n="39">Companionship forever new and glad ,</l>
     <l n="40">Through studies , meditations , and resources</l>
     <l n="41">Which nature , books , and crowded life supply .</l>
     <l n="42">And then you urged me to excel in something ;</l>
     <l n="43">( ‘ Better do one thing thoroughly , ’ you said ,</l>
     <l n="44">‘ Than fifty only tolerably well , ’ ) —</l>
     <l n="45">Something from which , with loving diligence ,</l>
     <l n="46">I might , should life 's contingencies require ,</l>
     <l n="47">Wring a support ;— and then , how carefully</l>
     <l n="48">You taught me how to deal with slippery men !</l>
     <l n="49">Taught me my rights , the laws , the very forms</l>
     <l n="50">By which to guard against neglect or fraud</l>
     <l n="51">In any business — till I 'm half a lawyer .</l>
     <l n="52">You taught me , too , how to protect myself ,</l>
     <l n="53">Should force assail me ; how to hold a pistol ,</l>
     <l n="54">Carry it , fire it — Heaven save me from the need !</l>
     <l n="55">And , when I was a very little girl ,</l>
     <l n="56">You used to take me round to see the houses</l>
     <l n="57">As they were built ; the clearing of the land ;</l>
     <l n="58">The digging of the cellar ; the foundations ;</l>
     <l n="59">You told me that the sand to make the mortar</l>
     <l n="60">Ought to be fresh , and not the sea-shore sand ;</l>
     <l n="61">Else would the salt keep up a certain moisture .</l>
     <l n="62">And then we 'd watch the framework , and the roofing ;</l>
     <l n="63">And you 'd explain the office and the name</l>
     <l n="64">Of every beam , and make me understand</l>
     <l n="65">The qualities of wood , seasoning of timber ,</l>
     <l n="66">And how the masons , and the carpenters ,</l>
     <l n="67">The plasterers , the plumbers , and the slaters ,</l>
     <l n="68">Should do their work ; and when they slighted it ,</l>
     <l n="69">And when the wood-work was too near the flue ,</l>
     <l n="70">The flue too narrow , or the draught defective :</l>
     <l n="71">So that , as you yourself have often said ,</l>
     <l n="72">I 'm better qualified than half the builders</l>
     <l n="73">To plan and build a house , and guard myself</l>
     <l n="74">From being cheated in the operation .</l>
     <l n="75">Fear not for me , my parents ; spend your income</l>
     <l n="76">Without a thought of saving . And besides ,</l>
     <l n="77">Had you not trained me aptly as you have ,</l>
     <l n="78">Am I not better — I — than many sparrows ?</l>

     <l n="1">The news of the great railroad accident</l>
     <l n="2">And of the sudden death of Percival ,</l>
     <l n="3">Coming so soon upon intelligence</l>
     <l n="4">Of his rare fortune in the legacy</l>
     <l n="5">From Kenrick , occupied the public mind</l>
     <l n="6">For a full day at least , and then was whelmed</l>
     <l n="7">In other marvels rushing thick upon it .</l>
     <l n="8">The mother and the daughter , who still bore</l>
     <l n="9">The name of Percival , came back from Paris</l>
     <l n="10">At once , on getting the unlooked-for news .</l>
     <l n="11">When Linda , after three weeks had elapsed ,</l>
     <l n="12">Re-entered , with a swelling heart , the house</l>
     <l n="13">To her so full of sacred memories ,</l>
     <l n="14">She was accosted by an officer</l>
     <l n="15">Who told her he had put his seal on all</l>
     <l n="16">The papers , plate , and jewelry belonging</l>
     <l n="17">To the late Albert Percival ,— and asked</l>
     <l n="18">If in her keeping were a watch and ring ,</l>
     <l n="19">Also some money , found upon his person :</l>
     <l n="20">If so , would she please give them up , and he ,</l>
     <l n="21">Who had authority to take them , would</l>
     <l n="22">Sign a receipt for all such property ,</l>

     <l n="62">Her case was taken up and thoroughly</l>

     <l n="69">The payment of the Kenrick legacy</l>
     <l n="70">For some six months ,— when it was all made over</l>
     <l n="71">To the reputed child , already rich</l>
     <l n="72">Through the law 's disposition of the sums</l>

     <l n="74">After the legal test , with brave composure</l>

     <l n="77">For a few months ’ support , with frugal care .</l>
     <l n="78">Claim to these jewels and the money found</l>
     <l n="79">Upon her mother 's person had been laid</l>
     <l n="80">Too eagerly by the contesting party ,</l>
     <l n="81">Who said that Percival , in dying last ,</l>
     <l n="82">Was heir to the effects ; but since the claim</l>
     <l n="83">Could only be upheld by proving marriage ,</l>
     <l n="84">The claimants sorrowfully gave it up .</l>

     <l n="85">One day as Linda stood with folded hands</l>

     <l n="90">A knock aroused her , and the opened door</l>

     <l n="119">The lady was the first to lower her eyes ;</l>

     <l n="176">‘ Tis unlike any that I 've ever seen . ”</l>
     <l n="177">And with the word she took it from the nail</l>

     <l n="180">Darker her dark face grew , when Harriet</l>
     <l n="181">Saw herself baffled ; taking out her purse</l>
     <l n="182">She drew from it a thousand-dollar bill ,</l>
     <l n="183">And said , “ Will this procure it ? ” — “ Harriet !</l>
     <l n="184">You 're mad to offer such a sum as that . ”</l>
     <l n="185">“ Old woman , if you anger me , you 'll rue it !</l>

     <l n="210">Contrasting their ingenuous love sincere</l>

     <l n="222">The imperious lady .— “ I 'm not bound to give</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="254">These interviews had made our Linda feel</l>
     <l n="255">How quite alone in the wide world she stood .</l>
     <l n="256">A letter came , after her parents ’ death ,</l>
     <l n="257">From her aunt , Mrs. Hammersley , requesting</l>
     <l n="258">A loan of fifty pounds , and telling all</l>
     <l n="259">The family distresses and shortcomings :</l>
     <l n="260">How this one 's husband had proved not so rich</l>
     <l n="261">As was expected ; how another 's was</l>
     <l n="262">A tyrant and a niggard , so close-fisted</l>
     <l n="263">He parcelled out with his own hands the sugar</l>
     <l n="264">For kitchen use ; and how another 's still ,</l>
     <l n="265">Though amply able to receive their mother ,</l>
     <l n="266">A widow now , had yet refused to do it ,</l>
     <l n="267">And even declined to make a contribution</l>
     <l n="268">For her support . And so the gossip ran .</l>
     <l n="269">The picture was not pleasant . With a sigh</l>
     <l n="270">Not for herself , but others , Linda penned</l>
     <l n="271">A letter to her aunt , relating all</l>
     <l n="272">The events that made her powerless to aid</l>
     <l n="273">Her needy kinsfolk . She despatched the letter ,</l>
     <l n="274">Then sat and thought awhile .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="275">“ And now for duty ! ”</l>
     <l n="276">She cried , and rose . She could not think of duty</l>
     <l n="277">Except as something grateful to her parents .</l>
     <l n="278">They were a presence so securely felt ,</l>
     <l n="279">And so related to her every act ,—</l>
     <l n="280">Their love was still so vigilant , so real ,</l>
     <l n="281">That to do what , and only what , she knew</l>
     <l n="282">They would approve , was duty paramount ;</l>
     <l n="283">And their approval was the smile of God !</l>
     <l n="284">Self-culture , work , and needful exercise ,—</l>
     <l n="285">This was her simple summing-up of duties</l>
     <l n="286">Immediately before her , and to be</l>
     <l n="287">Fulfilled without more parleying or delay .</l>
     <l n="288">She found that by the labor of a month</l>
     <l n="289">In painting flowers from nature , she could earn</l>
     <l n="290">Easily sixty dollars . This she did</l>
     <l n="291">For two years steadily . Then came a change .</l>
     <l n="292">From some cause unexplained , her wild-flower sketches ,</l>
     <l n="293">Which from their novelty and careful finish</l>
     <l n="294">At first had found a ready sale , were now</l>
     <l n="295">In less demand . Linda was not aware</l>
     <l n="296">That these elaborate works , to nature true ,</l>
     <l n="297">Had been so multiplied in copies , made</l>
     <l n="298">By hand , or printed by the chromo art ,</l>
     <l n="299">As to be sold at prices not one fifth</l>
     <l n="300">As high as the originals had cost .</l>
     <l n="301">Hence her own genius winged the storm and lent</l>
     <l n="302">The color to the cloud , that overhung</l>
     <l n="303">Her prospect , late so hopeful and serene .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="304">Now came her year of struggle ! Narrow means ,</l>
     <l n="305">Discouragement , the haunting fear of debt !</l>
     <l n="306">One summer day , a day reminding her</l>
     <l n="307">Of days supremely beautiful , immortal ,</l>
     <l n="308">( Since hallowed by undying love and joy ) ,</l>
     <l n="309">A little girl , the step-child , much endeared ,</l>

     <l n="311">On the same floor with Linda , came to her</l>
     <l n="312">And said : “ You promised me , Miss Percival ,</l>
     <l n="313">That some fine day you 'd take me in the cars</l>

     <l n="315">“ Well , Rachel Aiken , we will go to-day ,</l>
     <l n="316">If you will get permission from your father , ”</l>
     <l n="317">Said Linda , longing for the woodland air .</l>
     <l n="318">Gladly the father gave consent ; and so ,</l>
     <l n="319">Clad in her best , the little damsel sat ,</l>
     <l n="320">While Linda filled the luncheon-box , and made</l>
     <l n="321">The preparations needful .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="322">“ What is that ? ”</l>
     <l n="323">Asked Rachel , pointing to an open drawer</l>
     <l n="324">In which a case of polished ebony</l>
     <l n="325">Glittered and caught the eye . “ A pistol-case ! ”</l>
     <l n="326">“ And is the pistol loaded ? ” — “ I believe so . ”</l>
     <l n="327">“ And will you take it with you ? ” — “ Well , my dear ,</l>
     <l n="328">I did not think to do so : would you have me ? ”</l>
     <l n="329">“ Yes , if we 're going to the woods ; for panthers</l>
     <l n="330">Lurk in the woods , you know . ” — “ I 'll take it , Rachel ;</l>
     <l n="331">We call this a revolver . See ! Four times</l>
     <l n="332">I can discharge it . ” At a block of wood</l>
     <l n="333">She aimed and fired ; then carefully reloaded</l>
     <l n="334">The piece , and put it in a hidden pocket .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="335">Some ten miles from the city , at a place</l>
     <l n="336">Rich in diversity of wood and water ,</l>

     <l n="338">Never was day so lovely ! Never grass</l>
     <l n="339">So green ! And O the flowers ! “ Look , only look ,</l>
     <l n="340">Miss Percival ! What is it ? Can I pluck</l>
     <l n="341">As many as I want ? ” — “ Ay , that 's a harebell . ”</l>
     <l n="342">“ And O , look here ! This red and yellow flower !</l>
     <l n="343">Tell me its name . ” — “ A columbine . It grows</l>
     <l n="344">In clefts of rocks . That 's an anemone :</l>
     <l n="345">We call it so because the leaves are torn</l>
     <l n="346">So easily by the wind ; for anemos</l>
     <l n="347">Is Greek for wind . ” — “ Oh ! here 's a buttercup !</l>
     <l n="348">I know that well . Red clover , too , I know .</l>
     <l n="349">Is n't the dandelion beautiful ?</l>
     <l n="350">And O , Miss Percival , what flower is this ? ”</l>
     <l n="351">“ That 's a wild rose . ” — “ What , does the rose grow wild ?</l>
     <l n="352">But is not that delightful ? A wild rose !</l>
     <l n="353">And I can take as many as I want !</l>
     <l n="354">I did not dream the country was so fine .</l>
     <l n="355">How very happy must the children be</l>
     <l n="356">Who live here all the time ! ‘ Tis better far</l>

     <l n="358">The flowers are here all free , and quite as pretty</l>
     <l n="359">As garden flowers . O , hark ! Did ever bird</l>
     <l n="360">So sweetly sing ? ” — “ That was a wood-thrush , dear . ”</l>
     <l n="361">“ O darling wood-thrush ! Do not stop so soon !</l>
     <l n="362">Look there , on that stone wall ! What 's that ? ” — “ A squirrel . ”</l>
     <l n="363">“ Is that indeed a squirrel ? Are you sure ?</l>
     <l n="364">How I would like a nut to throw to him !</l>
     <l n="365">What are these little red things in the grass ? ”</l>
     <l n="366">“ Wild strawberries , my dear . ” — “ Wild strawberries !</l>
     <l n="367">And can I eat them ? ” — “ Yes , we 'll take a plate</l>

     <l n="371">And so the day</l>
     <l n="372">Slid on to noon ; and then , it being hot ,</l>
     <l n="373">They crossed a wall into a skirting wood ,</l>
     <l n="374">And there sat down upon a rocky slab</l>
     <l n="375">Covered with dry brown needles of the pine ,</l>
     <l n="376">And ate their dinner while the birds made music .</l>
     <l n="377">“ ‘ Tis a free concert , ours ! ” said Rachel Aiken :</l>

     <l n="397">On the rock 's slope , and peeled the mosses off</l>

     <l n="399">At the sky 's blue , while Rachel played around .</l>
     <l n="400">From tree to tree , from flower to flower , the child</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="403">To her feet she sprang !</l>
     <l n="404">Instinctively ( but not without a shudder )</l>
     <l n="405">She grasped the little pistol she had brought</l>
     <l n="406">At the child 's prompting ; from the rock ran down ,</l>
     <l n="407">And , at a sudden bend , encountered three</l>
     <l n="408">Young lusty ruffians , while , a few rods off ,</l>
     <l n="409">Another lifted Rachel in his arms ,</l>
     <l n="410">And to the thicker wood beyond moved on .</l>
     <l n="411">The three stood side by side as if to bar</l>
     <l n="412">The path to Linda , and their looks meant mischief .</l>
     <l n="413">The lane was narrow . “ For your life , make way ! ”</l>
     <l n="414">She cried , and raised the pistol . “ No , you do n't</l>
     <l n="415">Fool us by tricks like that ! ” the foremost said :</l>
     <l n="416">“ And so , my lady — ” But before the word</l>
     <l n="417">Was out there was a little puff of smoke ,</l>
     <l n="418">With an explosion , not encouraging ,—</l>

     <l n="420">Her road now clear , reckless of torn alpaca ,</l>
     <l n="421">Over the scattered branches Linda rushed ,</l>
     <l n="422">Till she drew near the leader of the gang ,</l>
     <l n="423">Who , stopping , drew a pistol with one hand ,</l>
     <l n="424">While with the other he held Rachel fast ,</l>
     <l n="425">Placing her as a shield before his breast .</l>

     <l n="426">But Linda did not waver . Dropping into</l>

     <l n="428">When to the shooting-gallery they went ,</l>
     <l n="429">She fired . An oath , the cry of pain and rage ,</l>
     <l n="430">Told her she had not missed her aim ,— the jaw</l>
     <l n="431">The ruffian left exposed . One moment more ,</l>
     <l n="432">Rachel was in her arms . Taking a path</l>
     <l n="433">Transverse , they hit the public road and entered</l>
     <l n="434">The railroad station as the train came in .</l>
     <l n="435">When they were safely seated , and the engine</l>

     <l n="438">Her face and fainted ; yet so quietly ,</l>
     <l n="439">But one among the passengers observed it ;</l>
     <l n="440">And he came up , and taking Rachel 's place</l>
     <l n="441">Supported Linda ; from a lady near</l>
     <l n="442">Borrowed some pungent salts restorative ,</l>
     <l n="443">And finding soon the sufferer was herself ,</l>
     <l n="444">Gave Rachel back her seat and took his own .</l>
     <l n="445">But at the city station , when arrived ,</l>
     <l n="446">This gentleman came up , and bowing , said :</l>

     <l n="449">Linda demurred . His firm will urged them in ,</l>

     <l n="455">Without a provocation , and one wounded .</l>
     <l n="456">The bullet was extracted . Dr. Payson ,</l>
     <l n="457">With his accustomed skill and promptitude ,</l>
     <l n="458">Performed the operation ; and the patient</l>

     <l n="462">She kissed the pistol that had been her mother 's ,</l>

     <l n="478">Unlock a door that showed a small apartment</l>
     <l n="479">Neat , with two windows looking on the rear ,</l>
     <l n="480">A small recess with a low , narrow bed ,</l>
     <l n="481">A sofa , a piano , and three chairs .</l>

     <l n="505">A bill of wood and coal for Rachel 's father —</l>

     <l n="508">He , the poor artisan , on whose account</l>

     <l n="513">At length , with lips compressed , and up and down</l>
     <l n="514">Moving her head as if to give assent</l>
     <l n="515">To some resolve , now fixed , she took her seat</l>
     <l n="516">At the piano ,— from her childhood 's days</l>

    <head>BY THE SEASIDE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Borne swiftly to the North Cape of the Bay ,</l>
     <l n="2">Still on the wings of steam the travellers went ;</l>
     <l n="3">And tenderly the purple sunset smiled</l>
     <l n="4">Upon their journey 's end ; a little cottage</l>
     <l n="5">With oaks and pines behind it , and , before ,</l>
     <l n="6">High ocean crags , and under them the ocean ,</l>
     <l n="7">Unintercepted far as sight could reach !</l>
     <l n="8">Foliage and waves ! A combination rare</l>
     <l n="9">Of lofty sylvan table-land , and then —</l>
     <l n="10">No barren strip to mar the interval —</l>
     <l n="11">The watery waste , the ever-changing main !</l>
     <l n="12">Old Ocean , with a diadem of verdure</l>
     <l n="13">Crowning the summit where his reach was stayed !</l>
     <l n="14">The shore , a line of rocks precipitous ,</l>
     <l n="15">Piled on each other , leaving chasms profound ,</l>
     <l n="16">Into whose rifts the foamy waters rushed</l>
     <l n="17">With gurgling roar , then flowed in runlets back</l>
     <l n="18">Till the surge drove them furiously in ,</l>
     <l n="19">Shaking with thunderous bass the cloven granite !</l>
     <l n="20">Yet to the earth-line of the tumbled cliffs</l>
     <l n="21">The wild grass crept ; the sweet-leafed bayberry</l>
     <l n="22">Scented the briny air ; the fern , the sumach ,</l>
     <l n="23">The prostrate juniper , the flowering thorn ,</l>
     <l n="24">The blueberry , the clinging blackberry ,</l>
     <l n="25">Tangled the fragrant sod ; and in their midst</l>
     <l n="26">The red rose bloomed , wet with the drifted spray .</l>
     <l n="27">From the main shore cut off , and isolated</l>
     <l n="28">By the invading , the circumfluent waves ,</l>
     <l n="29">A rock which time had made an island , spread</l>
     <l n="30">With a small patch of brine-defying herbage ,</l>
     <l n="31">Is known as Norman 's Woe ; for , on this rock ,</l>
     <l n="32">Two hundred years ago , was Captain Norman ,</l>
     <l n="33">In his good ship from England , driven and wrecked</l>
     <l n="34">In a wild storm , and every life was lost .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="35">Stand on the cliff near by ,— southeasterly</l>
     <l n="36">Are only waves on waves to the horizon ;</l>
     <l n="37">But easterly , less than two miles across ,</l>
     <l n="38">And forming with the coast-line , whence you look ,</l>
     <l n="39">The harbor 's entrance , stretches Eastern Point ,</l>
     <l n="40">A lighthouse at its end ; a mile of land</l>
     <l n="41">Arm-like thrust out to keep the ocean off ;</l>
     <l n="42">So narrow that beyond its width , due east ,</l>
     <l n="43">You see the Atlantic glittering , hardly made</l>
     <l n="44">Less inconspicuous by the intervention .</l>
     <l n="45">The cottage fare , the renovating breeze ,</l>
     <l n="46">The grove , the piny odors , and the flowers ,</l>
     <l n="47">Rambles at morning and the twilight time ,</l>
     <l n="48">Sea-bathing , joyous and exhilarant ,</l>
     <l n="49">Siestas on the rocks , with inhalations</l>
     <l n="50">Of the pure breathings of the ocean-tide ,—</l>
     <l n="51">Soon wrought in both the maidens visible change .</l>
     <l n="52">Each day their walks grew longer , till at last</l>
     <l n="53">A ten-mile tramp was no infrequent one .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="54">“ And where to-day ? ” asked Rachel , one fair morning .</l>
     <l n="55">“ To Eastern Point , ” said Linda ; “ with our baskets !</l>
     <l n="56">For berries , there 's no place like Eastern Point ;</l>
     <l n="57">Blackberries , whortleberries , pigeon-pears ,—</l>
     <l n="58">All we shall find in prodigality ! ”</l>
     <l n="59">And so by what was once the old stage-road</l>
     <l n="60">Contiguous to the shore , and through the woods ,—</l>
     <l n="61">Though long abandoned save by scenery-hunters ,</l>
     <l n="62">And overgrown with grass and vines and bushes ;</l>
     <l n="63">Then leaving on their right the wooded hill</l>
     <l n="64">Named from the rattlesnakes , now obsolete ;</l>
     <l n="65">Then by the Cove , and by the bend of shore</l>
     <l n="66">Over Stage-rocks , by little Half-moon beach ,</l>
     <l n="67">Across the Cut , the Creek , by the Hotel ,</l>
     <l n="68">And through the village , even to Eastern Point ,—</l>
     <l n="69">The maidens went , and had a happy day .</l>
     <l n="70">And , when the setting sun blazed clear and mild ,</l>
     <l n="71">And every little cloud was steeped in crimson ,</l>
     <l n="72">To a small wharf upon the harbor side ,</l>
     <l n="73">Along the beach they strolled , and looked across</l>
     <l n="74">The stretch of wave to Norman 's Woe ;— and Linda</l>
     <l n="75">Wistfully said : “ Heigho ! I own I 'm tired ;</l>
     <l n="76">And you , too , Rachel , you look travel-worn ,</l>
     <l n="77">And hardly good for four miles more of road .</l>
     <l n="78">Could we but make this short cut over water !</l>
     <l n="79">What would I give now for a boat to take us</l>
     <l n="80">To Webber 's Cove ! O , if some timely oarsman</l>
     <l n="81">Would only come and say , ‘ Fair demoiselles ,</l>
     <l n="82">My skiff lies yonder , rocking on the tide ,</l>
     <l n="83">And eager to convey you to your home ! ’</l>
     <l n="84">Then would I —— Rachel ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="85">“ What , Miss Percival ? ”</l>
     <l n="86">“ Look at those men descending from the ridge ! ”</l>
     <l n="87">“ Well , I can see an old man and a young . ”</l>
     <l n="88">“ And is that all you have to say of them ? ”</l>
     <l n="89">“ How should I know about them ? Ah ! I see !</l>
     <l n="90">Those are the two we met three weeks ago ,—</l>
     <l n="91">The day we left New York ,— met in the cars . ”</l>
     <l n="92">“ Ay , Rachel , and their name is Lothian ;</l>
     <l n="93">Father and son are they . Who would have thought</l>
     <l n="94">That they would find their way to Eastern Point ? ”</l>
     <l n="95">“ Why not , as well as we , Miss Percival ?</l>
     <l n="96">Look ! To the wharf they go ; and there , beside it ,</l>
     <l n="97">If I 'm not much mistaken , lies a boat .</l>
     <l n="98">The wished-for oarsman he ! O , this is luck !</l>
     <l n="99">They 're going to the boat ,— he 'll row us over ,</l>
     <l n="100">I 'll run and ask him . See you to my basket . ”</l>
     <l n="101">“ Rachel ! Stop , Rachel ! Fie , you forward girl !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="103">But Rachel did not hear , or would not heed ,</l>
     <l n="104">Straight to the boat she ran , and , as the men</l>
     <l n="105">Drew nigh and stopped ,— to Linda 's dire dismay</l>
     <l n="106">She went up and accosted them , and pointed</l>
     <l n="107">To Norman 's Woe ,— then back to her companion ,—</l>
     <l n="108">And then , with gesture eloquent of thanks</l>
     <l n="109">For some reply the younger man had made ,</l>
     <l n="110">She seemed to lead the way , and he to follow</l>
     <l n="111">Along the foot-path to the granite bench</l>
     <l n="112">Where Linda sat , abashed and wondering .</l>
     <l n="113">And , when they stood before her , Rachel said</l>
     <l n="114">“ Miss Percival , here 's Mr. Lothian ;</l>
     <l n="115">He has a boat near by , and will be glad</l>
     <l n="116">To give us seats and row us both across . ”</l>
     <l n="117">Charles Lothian bowed , and Linda , blushing , said ,</l>

     <l n="120">Regret at her success , if you 're content . ”</l>
     <l n="121">“ More than content , I 'm very glad , ” said Charles ;</l>
     <l n="122">“ My boat is amply large enough for four ,</l>

     <l n="138">Checked by a reminiscence that might be</l>

     <l n="147">From purple cloudlets , edged with fiery gold ,</l>
     <l n="148">And a bright crimson fleece the sun had left ,</l>
     <l n="149">Fell on the liquid plain incarnadined .</l>
     <l n="150">The very pulse of ocean now was mute ;</l>

     <l n="152">Motionless on the coastwise ships the sails</l>
     <l n="153">Hung limp and white , their very shadows white .</l>
     <l n="154">The lighthouse windows drank the kindling red ,</l>

     <l n="156">“ A heavenly eve ! ” sighed Linda , rapt in praise ,</l>

     <l n="159">“ But you row well ! ” cried Charles . “ I might return</l>
     <l n="160">The compliment , ” said Linda . “ See that duck !</l>
     <l n="161">How near , how still he floats ! He seems to know</l>
     <l n="162">The holy time will keep him safe from harm . ”</l>
     <l n="163">“ Had I a gun , ” said Charles — “ You would not use it , ”</l>

     <l n="165">“ ‘ Nobility obliges ’ ; sympathy</l>

     <l n="200">And Boston Light winking at Minot 's Ledge !</l>
     <l n="201">Like the wise virgins , all , with ready lamps !</l>

     <l n="205">“ Lest you turn Pagan , then , I 'll sing , ” quoth Linda .</l>

     <l n="39">A change came over Linda 's countenance ,</l>

     <l n="56">The morning sea-fog like an incense rose</l>

     <l n="60">Linda stood on the summit looking down</l>
     <l n="61">On Norman 's Woe , and felt upon her brow</l>
     <l n="62">The cooling haze that foiled the August heat .</l>
     <l n="63">Near her knelt Rachel , hunting curiously</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="76">Yet Linda was not altogether happy .</l>
     <l n="77">Why was it that Charles Lothian had called</l>
     <l n="78">Once , and once only , after their adventure ?</l>
     <l n="79">Called just to ask her , How she found herself ?</l>
     <l n="80">And , Did she overtask herself in rowing ?</l>
     <l n="81">How happened it , in all her walks and rambles ,</l>
     <l n="82">They rarely met , or , if they met , a bow</l>
     <l n="83">Formal and cold was all the interview ?</l>
     <l n="84">While thus she mused , she started at a cry :</l>
     <l n="85">“ Ah ! here 's our siren , cumbent on the rocks !</l>
     <l n="86">Where should a siren be , if not on rocks ? ”</l>
     <l n="87">Old Lothian 's voice ! He came with rod and line</l>
     <l n="88">To try an angler 's luck . Behind him stepped</l>
     <l n="89">Charles , who stood still , as if arrested , when</l>
     <l n="90">He noticed Linda .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="91">Then , as if relenting</l>
     <l n="92">In some resolve , he jumped from rock to rock</l>
     <l n="93">To where she leaned ; and , greeting her , inquired :</l>
     <l n="94">“ Have you been sketching ? ” — “ No , for indolence</l>
     <l n="95">Is now my occupation . ” — “ Here 's a book ;</l>
     <l n="96">May I not look at it ? ” — “ You may . ” — “ Is this</l>
     <l n="97">An album ? ” — “ ‘ Tis my sketch-book . ” — “ Do you mean</l>
     <l n="98">These are your sketches , and original ? ”</l>
     <l n="99">“ Ay , truly , mine ; from nature every one . ”</l>
     <l n="100">“ But here we have high art ! No amateur</l>
     <l n="101">Could color flower like that . ” — “ Ah ! there you touch me ;</l>
     <l n="102">For I 'm no amateur in painting flowers ,—</l>
     <l n="103">I get my living by it . ” — “ I could praise</l>
     <l n="104">That sea-view also ,— what a depth of sky !</l>
     <l n="105">That beach ,— that schooner flying from a squall ,—</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="107">Then the discourse slid off to woman 's rights ;</l>
     <l n="108">For Lothian held a newspaper which told</l>
     <l n="109">Of some convention , the report of which</l>
     <l n="110">Might raise a smile . One of the lady speakers ,</l>
     <l n="111">It seems , would give her sex the privilege</l>
     <l n="112">Of taking the initiative in wooing ,</l>
     <l n="113">If so disposed !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="114">“ Indeed , why not ? ” cried Linda .</l>
     <l n="115">“ Indeed , you almost take my breath away</l>
     <l n="116">With your Why not , Miss Percival ! Why not ? ”</l>
     <l n="117">“ Yes , I repeat ,— if so disposed , why not ?</l>
     <l n="118">For why should woman any more than man</l>
     <l n="119">Play the dissembler , with so much at stake ?</l>
     <l n="120">I know the ready taunt that here will rise :</l>
     <l n="121">‘ Already none too backward are our girls</l>
     <l n="122">In husband-seeking . ’ Seeking in what way ?</l>
     <l n="123">Seeking by stratagem and management ,—</l>
     <l n="124">Not by frank , honest means ! What food for mirth</l>
     <l n="125">‘ Twould give to shallow men to see a woman</l>
     <l n="126">Court the relation , intertwined with all</l>
     <l n="127">Of purest happiness that she may crave ,—</l>
     <l n="128">The ties of wife and mother ! O , what pointing ,</l>
     <l n="129">Sneering , and joking ! And yet why should care</l>
     <l n="130">Thoughtful and pure and wisely provident ,</l>
     <l n="131">That Nature 's sacred prompting shall not fail ,</l>
     <l n="132">Be one thing for a man , and quite another</l>
     <l n="133">For her , the woman ? Why this flimsy mask ?</l>
     <l n="134">This playing of a part , put on to suit ,</l>
     <l n="135">Not the heart 's need , but Fashion custom-bound ?</l>
     <l n="136">Feigning we must be sought , and never seek ?</l>
     <l n="137">Now , through these social hindrances and bars ,</l>
     <l n="138">The bold , perhaps the intriguing , carry off</l>
     <l n="139">Prizes the true and modest ought to win .</l>
     <l n="140">And so we hear it coarsely said of husbands ,</l>
     <l n="141">‘ Better a poor one far , than none at all ! ’</l>
     <l n="142">A thought ignoble , and which no true woman</l>
     <l n="143">Should harbor for a moment . Give her freedom ,</l>
     <l n="144">Freedom to seek , and she 'll not harbor it !</l>
     <l n="145">Because if woman , equally with man ,</l>
     <l n="146">Were privileged thus , she would discriminate</l>
     <l n="147">Much more than now , and fewer sordid unions</l>
     <l n="148">Would be the sure result . For what if man</l>
     <l n="149">Were chained to singleness until some woman</l>
     <l n="150">Might seek his hand in marriage , would he be</l>
     <l n="151">Likely as now to make a wise election ?</l>
     <l n="152">Would he not say , ‘ Time flies ; my chances lessen</l>
     <l n="153">And I must plainly take what I can get ? ’</l>
     <l n="154">True , there are mercenary men enough ,</l>
     <l n="155">Seeking rich dowries ; they 'd find fewer dupes ,</l>
     <l n="156">Were women free as men to seek and choose ,</l>
     <l n="157">Banish the senseless inequality ,</l>
     <l n="158">And you make marriage less a vulgar game</l>
     <l n="159">In which one tries to circumvent the other .</l>
     <l n="160">Oh ! all this morbid ribaldry of men ,</l>
     <l n="161">And all this passive imbecility ,</l>
     <l n="162">And superstitious inactivity ,</l>
     <l n="163">Dissimulation and improvidence ,</l>
     <l n="164">False shame and lazy prejudice of women ,</l>
     <l n="165">Where the great miracle of sex concerns us ,</l>

     <l n="17">“ Truly , Miss Percival , you puzzle me , ”</l>

     <l n="25">Not even like an undeveloped man !</l>
     <l n="26">And I 'm not greatly exercised by fear ,</l>
     <l n="27">Leaning here by your side thus lazily . ”</l>

     <l n="33">The joy that sparkled in her eyes said “ Yes ”</l>
     <l n="34">Before her tongue could duplicate assent .</l>
     <l n="35">Said Charles , “ I 'll bring the horses round at six . ”</l>
     <l n="36">“ I will be ready , Mr. Lothian . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="37">There was no breach of punctuality :</l>
     <l n="38">Though sighs , from deeper founts than tears , were heaved ,</l>
     <l n="39">When she drew forth the summer riding-habit</l>
     <l n="40">Worn last when in the saddle with her father .</l>
     <l n="41">“ Here are the horses at the door ! ” cried Rachel ;</l>
     <l n="42">“ A bay horse and a black ; the bay is yours . ”</l>
     <l n="43">When they were mounted , Lothian remarked :</l>
     <l n="44">“ Little Good Harbor Beach shall be our point ;</l>
     <l n="45">So called because an Indian once pronounced</l>
     <l n="46">The harbor ‘ little good , ’ meaning ‘ quite bad ’ ;</l>
     <l n="47">A broad and open beach , from which you see</l>
     <l n="48">Running out southerly the ocean side</l>
     <l n="49">Of Eastern Point ; its lofty landward end</l>
     <l n="50">Gray with huge cliffs . There shall you mark ‘ Bass Rock , ’</l>
     <l n="51">Rare outlook when a storm-wind from the east</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="53">The air was genial , and a rapid trot</l>
     <l n="54">Soon brought them to the beach . The ebb had left</l>
     <l n="55">A level stretch of sand , wide , smooth , and hard ,</l>
     <l n="56">With not a hoof-mark on the glistening plain .</l>
     <l n="57">The horses tossed their heads with snorting pride ,</l>
     <l n="58">Feeling the ocean breeze , as curved and fell</l>
     <l n="59">Up the long line the creeping fringe of foam ,</l>
     <l n="60">Then backward slid in undulating glass ,</l>
     <l n="61">While all the west in Tyrian splendor flamed .</l>
     <l n="62">“ But this is life ! ” cried Linda , as she put</l>
     <l n="63">Her horse to all his speed , and shook her whip .</l>
     <l n="64">They skimmed the sand , they chased the flying wave ,</l>
     <l n="65">They walked their horses slow along the beach :</l>
     <l n="66">And , as the light fell on a far-off sail ,</l>
     <l n="67">And made it a white glory to the eye ,</l>
     <l n="68">Said Linda : “ See ! it fades into the gray ,</l>
     <l n="69">And now ‘ tis dim , and now is seen no more !</l>
     <l n="70">Yet would a little height reveal it still .</l>
     <l n="71">So fade from memory scenes which higher points</l>
     <l n="72">Of vision shall reveal : the beautiful ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="82">On they rode ,</l>
     <l n="83">After these words , in silence for a mile</l>
     <l n="84">Upon their homeward way . Then Lothian :</l>
     <l n="85">“ And what will your address be , in the city ? ”</l>
     <l n="86">“ I do not know , nor care , ” said Linda , switching</l>
     <l n="87">Her horse 's ear , to start a quicker trot .</l>
     <l n="88">Another mile of silence ! “ Look ! ” cried he ;</l>
     <l n="89">“ The lighthouse light salutes us ! ” — “ Yes , I see . ”</l>
     <l n="90">“ Why do you go so fast ? ” — “ I 'll slacken speed</l>
     <l n="91">If you desire it . There ! ” They breathed their horses ;</l>
     <l n="92">Then Lothian : “ Indeed , I hope that we</l>
     <l n="93">Shall meet again . ” — “ Why not ? The world is wide ,</l>
     <l n="94">But I have known a letter in a bottle ,</l>
     <l n="95">Flung over in mid-ocean , to be found</l>
     <l n="96">And reach its owner . Doubtless , we may meet . ”</l>
     <l n="97">“ I 'm glad to find you confident of that . ”</l>
     <l n="98">Silence again ! And so they rode along</l>
     <l n="99">Till they saw Rachel coming from the house</l>
     <l n="100">To greet them . Charles helped Linda to dismount ,</l>
     <l n="101">Held out his hand , and said , “ Good by , Miss Linda . ”</l>
     <l n="102">“ Good by ! ” she cheerily answered ; “ bid your father</l>
     <l n="103">Good by for me . And so you go indeed</l>
     <l n="104">To-morrow ? ” — “ Yes , we may not meet again . ”</l>
     <l n="105">“ Well ; pleasant journey ! ” — “ Thank you . Good by , Rachel . ”</l>
     <l n="106">He rode away , leading her panting horse ;</l>
     <l n="107">And , when the trees concealed him , Linda rushed</l>
     <l n="108">Up stairs , and locked the door , and wept awhile .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="109">As , early the next morning , she looked forth</l>
     <l n="110">On the blue ocean from the open window ,</l>
     <l n="111">“ Now , then , for work ! ” she cried , and drew her palm</l>
     <l n="112">Across her brow , as if to thrust away</l>
     <l n="113">Thoughts that too perseveringly came back</l>
     <l n="114">She heard a step . ‘ Tis he ! “ I hardly hoped ,</l>
     <l n="115">Miss Percival , to find you up so early :</l>
     <l n="116">Good by , once more ! ” — “ Good by ! Do n't miss the train . ”</l>
     <l n="117">At this a shadow fell on Lothian 's face ,</l>
     <l n="118">As with uplifted hat and thwarted smile ,</l>
     <l n="119">He turned away . Then off with hasty stride</l>
     <l n="120">He walked and struck the bushes listlessly .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="121">“ What did I mean by speaking so ? ” said Linda ,</l>
     <l n="122">With hand outstretched , as if to draw him back .</l>
     <l n="123">“ Poor fellow ! He looked sad ; but why — but why</l>
     <l n="124">Is he so undemonstrative ? And why</l>
     <l n="125">Could he not ask again for my address ,</l>
     <l n="126">I 'd like to know ? ” Poor Linda ! She could preach ,</l>
     <l n="127">But , like her elders , could not always practise .</l>

      <l n="15">At length I solve the mystery ! Those notes ,</l>
      <l n="16">Pensively slow and sadly exquisite ,</l>
      <l n="17">Were what the wood-thrush piped at early dawn</l>
      <l n="18">After that evening passage in the boat ,</l>

      <l n="134">His wife and children . He could take the pittance</l>

      <l n="136">Himself and his companions of the jug .</l>
      <l n="137">When out of work , as he would often be ,</l>
      <l n="138">Then double toil for her ! with peevish words</l>
      <l n="139">From him , the sole requital of it all !</l>
      <l n="140">Child after child she bore him ; but , compelled</l>
      <l n="141">Too quickly after childbirth to return</l>
      <l n="142">To the old wash-tub , all her sufferings</l>
      <l n="143">Reacted on the children , and they died ,</l>
      <l n="144">Haply in infancy the most of them ,—</l>

      <l n="149">In this one relic all her love and hope</l>
      <l n="150">And all that made her life endurable</l>
      <l n="151">At length were centred . She had saved a dollar</l>
      <l n="152">To buy for him a pair of overshoes ;</l>
      <l n="153">But , as she went to get them , Blount waylaid her ,</l>
      <l n="154">Learnt that she had the money , forced it from her .</l>

      <l n="160">Blount was a cunning ruffian ; well he knew</l>
      <l n="161">How far to go , and where and when to pause .</l>
      <l n="162">Fluent and specious with his tongue , he kept ,</l>
      <l n="163">In his small sphere , a certain show of credit ;</l>
      <l n="164">And he could blow in tune for mother church ,</l>
      <l n="165">Though few the pennies he himself would give her .</l>

      <l n="168">To love a load that galled and wearied her .</l>
      <l n="169">But custom , social fear , and , above all ,</l>
      <l n="170">Those sacramental manacles the church</l>
      <l n="171">Had bound her in , and to the end would keep ,</l>
      <l n="172">Forbade the poor , scared , helpless little woman</l>
      <l n="173">To free herself , by one condign resolve ,</l>
      <l n="174">From the foul incubus that sucked her life .</l>

      <l n="383">Health , youth , and competence were mine , and he</l>

      <l n="386">Regrets and disappointments were forgotten</l>
      <l n="387">In the reflection , He , then , is unhappy !</l>

      <l n="395">It is as I supposed : an obstacle</l>

      <l n="403">Though not by means that I could justify .</l>
      <l n="404">In Charles 's private escritoire he found</l>
      <l n="405">A memorandum that explained it all .</l>
      <l n="406">Among the obligations overlooked ,</l>
      <l n="407">In settling up the firm 's accounts , was one</l>
      <l n="408">Of fifty thousand dollars , payable</l>
      <l n="409">To an estate , the representatives</l>
      <l n="410">Of which were six small children and a widow ,</l>
      <l n="411">Dependent now on what they could derive</l>

      <l n="413">Charles shoulders it , although it crushes him ;</l>
      <l n="414">And hopes to keep his father ignorant .</l>
      <l n="415">I can command one quarter of the sum</l>
      <l n="416">Already — but the rest ? That staggers me .</l>
      <l n="417">And yet why should I falter ? Look at him !</l>
      <l n="418">Let his example be my high incentive .</l>
      <l n="419">I 'll be his helpmate , and he shall not know it .</l>
      <l n="420">Poor Charles ! I 'll toil for him ,— to him devote</l>
      <l n="421">All that I have of energy and skill ,</l>
      <l n="422">All I acquire . Ambition shall not mount</l>
      <l n="423">Less loftily for having Love to help it .</l>
      <l n="424">Come forth , my easel ! All thy work has been</l>
      <l n="425">Girl 's play till now ; now will I truly venture .</l>
      <l n="426">I 've a new object now — to rescue him !</l>

      <l n="30">From putting real names on paper here .</l>
      <l n="31">Let me then call the man 's name , Denison ;</l>
      <l n="32">He 's somewhat younger than his wife , a lady</l>
      <l n="33">Advanced in years , but her heart wholly set</l>
      <l n="34">On the frivolities of fashion still .</l>
      <l n="35">I see the situation at a glance :</l>
      <l n="36">A mercenary marriage on the part</l>

      <l n="38">Upon the daughter 's property ; the mother</l>
      <l n="39">Under his evil influence , and expecting</l>

      <l n="41">Thus leaving all to them ;— and Harriet</l>
      <l n="42">Not quite so dull but she can penetrate</l>
      <l n="43">Denison 's motive and her mother 's hope !</l>
      <l n="44">A sad state for an invalid who feels</l>
      <l n="45">That any hour may be her last ! To-day</l>
      <l n="46">Harriet confessed ; for she has been alarmed</l>
      <l n="47">By some bad symptoms lately . As she urged it ,</l>
      <l n="48">I sent word to the bishop , and he came ,</l>
      <l n="49">And she was formally confirmed , and taken</l>

      <l n="52">Another summons ! In the drawing-room ,</l>
      <l n="53">Whom should I meet but Denison ? His stare</l>
      <l n="54">Had something vicious in it ; but we bowed ,</l>
      <l n="55">And he remarked : “ I hear that Harriet ,</l>
      <l n="56">Caught in your Catholic net , is turning saint .</l>
      <l n="57">No foul play , priest ! She 's not in a condition</l>
      <l n="58">To make a will , or give away her money .</l>
      <l n="59">Remember that , and do not waste your words . ”</l>
      <l n="60">My color rose , and the brute Adam in me</l>
      <l n="61">Would , uncontrolled , have surely knocked him down .</l>
      <l n="62">But I cast off temptation , and replied :</l>
      <l n="63">“ Sir , I 'm responsible to God , not man . ”</l>
      <l n="64">I left him , and passed on to Harriet .</l>
      <l n="65">I found her greatly moved ; an interview</l>
      <l n="66">She had been having with her mother caused</l>
      <l n="67">The agitation . “ Take me hence ! ” she cried ;</l>
      <l n="68">“ I 'll not remain another day or hour</l>
      <l n="69">Under this roof . I tell you , I 'm not safe</l>
      <l n="70">With these two , watching , dogging , maddening me . ”</l>
      <l n="71">She rang the bell , and to the servant said :</l>
      <l n="72">“ My carriage , and that quickly ! ” Then to me :</l>
      <l n="73">“ I 'll show them that I 'm mistress of my fortune</l>
      <l n="74">And of myself . Call on me in an hour</l>
      <l n="75">At the Fifth Avenue Hotel , for there</l>
      <l n="76">Henceforth I make my home . ” And there</l>
      <l n="77">I called , as she had ordered , and we met</l>
      <l n="78">In her own parlor . “ What I wish , ” said she ,</l>
      <l n="79">“ Is to give all I have , without reserve ,</l>
      <l n="80">For the foundation that I 've planned . I 'll send</l>
      <l n="81">Directions to my lawyer , and the papers</l>
      <l n="82">Shall be prepared at once . ” — “ Before you do it ,</l>
      <l n="83">Let me learn more of you and yours , ” said I :</l>
      <l n="84">“ Who was your father ? ” Then , to my surprise ,</l>
      <l n="85">I learnt that he was one whom I had met</l>
      <l n="86">Some years before ,— in his death-hour had met .</l>
      <l n="87">“ But you 've a sister ? ” suddenly I asked .</l>
      <l n="88">Surprised , she answered : “ A half-sister — yes —</l>
      <l n="89">I 've seen her only once ; for many years</l>
      <l n="90">I lived in Europe ; she 's in England now ,</l>
      <l n="91">And married happily . On three occasions</l>
      <l n="92">I 've sent her money . ” — “ Do you correspond ? ”</l>
      <l n="93">“ Not often ; here are letters from her , full</l>
      <l n="94">Of thanks for all I 've given her . ” — “ In your will</l>
      <l n="95">Shall you remember her ? ” — “ If you advise it . ”</l>
      <l n="96">“ Then I advise a liberal bequest .</l>
      <l n="97">And now I must attend a sufferer</l>
      <l n="98">Who waits my help . ” — “ Father , I would confess . ”</l>
      <l n="99">“ Daughter , be quick : I listen . ” Harriet</l>
      <l n="100">Then gave a sad recital of a trial</l>
      <l n="101">And a divorce ; and ( but reluctantly )</l>
      <l n="102">Told of a terrible suspicion , born</l>
      <l n="103">Of a remark , dropped by a servant once ,</l>
      <l n="104">Concerning her unlikeness to her father :</l>
      <l n="105">But never could she wring a confirmation</l>
      <l n="106">Of the distressing story from her mother .</l>
      <l n="107">“ Tell her , ” said I , “ you mean to leave your sister</l>
      <l n="108">A handsome legacy . ” She promised this .</l>
      <l n="109">Then saying I would call the following day ,</l>

      <l n="131">Received that day , communicating news</l>
      <l n="132">Of Kenrick 's large bequest ; the father 's effort</l>
      <l n="133">In dying to convey in legal form</l>
      <l n="134">To his child Linda all this property ;</l>
      <l n="135">The failure of the effort ; his decease ,</l>
      <l n="136">And all I knew of subsequent events .</l>
      <l n="137">And the good bishop , after careful thought ,</l>
      <l n="138">Replied : “ Some way the mother must be brought</l>

      <l n="140">I told him I had charged it on the daughter</l>

      <l n="142">Designed for Linda ; this , perchance , might wring</l>
      <l n="143">Confession from the guilty one . He seemed</l>

      <l n="145">“ When that is got , there 's but a single course</l>
      <l n="146">For you to urge on Harriet ; for , my son ,</l>

      <l n="150">If the Church had in it no interest :</l>

      <l n="153">Till she does this , her soul will be in peril ;</l>
      <l n="154">When she does this , she shall be made the ward</l>

    <head>BESIDE THE LAKE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The sun of August from a clear blue sky</l>
     <l n="2">Shone on Lake Saranac . The South-wind stirred</l>
     <l n="3">Mildly the woods encircling , that threw down</l>
     <l n="4">A purple shadow on the liquid smoothness</l>
     <l n="5">Glassing the eastern border , while the west</l>
     <l n="6">Lay bared to light .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Wild , virgin nature all !</l>
     <l n="8">Except that here and there a partial clearing ,</l>
     <l n="9">Made by the sportsman 's axe for summer tents ,</l>
     <l n="10">Dented the massive verdure , and revealed</l>
     <l n="11">A little slope of bank , dotted with stumps</l>
     <l n="12">And brown with slender aromatic leaves</l>
     <l n="13">Shed from the pine , the hemlock , and the fir</l>
     <l n="14">In layers that gave a soft and slippery carpet .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">Near one of these small openings where the breeze</l>
     <l n="16">Crept resinous and cool from evergreens</l>
     <l n="17">Behind them , while the sun blazed bright before ,—</l>
     <l n="18">Where with the pine-trees ’ vapory depth of hue</l>
     <l n="19">The whiteness of a spacious tent contrasted ,</l>
     <l n="20">Beside which , on a staff , the nation 's flag</l>
     <l n="21">Flung out its crimson with protecting pride ,—</l>
     <l n="22">Reclined a wife and husband , looking down</l>
     <l n="23">Less on the glorious lake than on the glory</l>
     <l n="24">That , through a gauzy veil , played round the head</l>
     <l n="25">Of a reposing infant , golden-tressed ,</l>
     <l n="26">Asleep upon a deer-skin at their feet ,</l>
     <l n="27">While a huge dog kept watchful guard beyond :</l>
     <l n="28">For there lay little Mary Merivale .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="29">Boats on the lake showed that this group detached</l>
     <l n="30">Were part of a well-chosen company .</l>
     <l n="31">Here children ran and frolicked on the beach ;</l>
     <l n="32">There an old man , rowed by two guides , stood up</l>
     <l n="33">With rod and line and reel , while swiftly flew</l>
     <l n="34">The reel , announcing that a vigorous trout</l>
     <l n="35">Just then had seized the hook . Came the loud cry ,—</l>
     <l n="36">“ Look , Charles ! Look , Linda ! See me land him now !</l>
     <l n="37">Do n't touch him with your scoop , men ! I can fetch him , ” —</l>
     <l n="38">In tones not unfamiliar to our ears .</l>
     <l n="39">And there , six boats swept by , from which the voices</l>
     <l n="40">Of merry children and their elder friends —</l>
     <l n="41">Mothers and fathers , teachers , faded aunts ,</l>
     <l n="42">Dyspeptic uncles , wonderfully cured</l>
     <l n="43">All by this tonic , Adirondack air —</l>
     <l n="44">Came musical and loud : a strange collection ,</l>
     <l n="45">Winnowed by Rachel ( now the important queen</l>
     <l n="46">Of all this sanitary revelry )</l>
     <l n="47">From her acquaintance in the public schools ;</l>
     <l n="48">Whence her quick sympathies had carried her</l>
     <l n="49">Straight to the overworked , the poor , the ailing ,</l>
     <l n="50">Among the families of her associates ,</l>
     <l n="51">When Linda planned this happy enterprise</l>
     <l n="52">Of a grand camping-out for one whole month .</l>
     <l n="53">The blind aunt and the grandmother , of course ,</l>
     <l n="54">High and important persons , Rachel 's aids ,</l>
     <l n="55">Graced the occasion ; for the ancient dame</l>
     <l n="56">Had lived in such a region in her youth ,</l>
     <l n="57">And in all sylvan craft was proudly wise :</l>
     <l n="58">Declaring that this taste of life would add</l>
     <l n="59">Some ten years to her eighty-five , at least .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="60">On went the boats , all large and safely manned ,</l>
     <l n="61">In competition not too venturesome .</l>
     <l n="62">Then , from a rocky outlook on the hill ,</l>
     <l n="63">There came a gush of music from a band ,</l>
     <l n="64">Employed to cheer with timely melody</l>
     <l n="65">This strange encampment in the wilderness .</l>
     <l n="66">Hark ! Every voice is hushed as down the lake</l>
     <l n="67">The breathing clarions accordant send</l>
     <l n="68">The tune of “ Love Not ” to each eager ear !</l>
     <l n="69">The very infant , in its slumber , smiled</l>
     <l n="70">As if a dream of some old paradise</l>
     <l n="71">Had been awakened by the ravishment .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="72">“ Look at the child ! ” cried Linda ; “ mark that smile !</l>

     <l n="75">At least as we esteem the world ! ” cried Charles .</l>
     <l n="76">“ And yet , ” said Linda , “ ‘ tis a glorious world :</l>
     <l n="77">See how those families enjoy themselves ! ”</l>
     <l n="78">“ And who created all this happiness ? ”</l>
     <l n="79">The husband said ,— “ who , after God , but Linda ?</l>
     <l n="80">Who spends her money , not in rearing piles</l>
     <l n="81">Of cold and costly marble for her pride ,—</l>
     <l n="82">Not in great banquets for the rich and gay</l>
     <l n="83">Who need them not , and laugh at those who give ,—</l>
     <l n="84">Where , at one feast , enough is spent to make</l>
     <l n="85">All these poor people radiant for a month ,—</l>
     <l n="86">But in exhilarations coming from</l>
     <l n="87">Communicated joy and health and life ,—</l>

    <p n="2">“ Oh ! lacking love and best experience . ”</p>
    <p n="3">An extreme Materialism here comes to the support of a grim theology . In his “ Physiology and Pathology of the Mind , ” Dr. Maudsley says : “ To talk about the purity and innocence of a child 's mind is a part of that poetical idealism and willing hypocrisy by which man ignores realities and delights to walk in a vain show . ” Such sweeping generalizations do not inspire confidence in the writer 's prudence . Christ was nearer the truth when he said , concerning little children ,— “ Of such is the kingdom of heaven . ”</p>
    <p n="4">PAGE 64 .</p>
    <p n="5">“ Few honorable outlooks for support , Excepting marriage . ”</p>
    <p n="6">Referring to the fact that in Massachusetts , during the ten years from 1859 to 1869 , the increase of crime among women has been much greater than among men , Miss Catherine Beecher remarks : “ But turning from these ( the criminal class ) to the daughters of the most wealthy class , those who have generous and devoted aspirations also feel that for them , too , there is no opening , no promotion , no career , except that of marriage ,— and for this they are trained to feel that it is disgraceful to seek . They have nothing to do but wait to be sought . Trained to believe marriage their highest boon , they are disgraced for seeking it , and must affect indifference .</p>
    <p n="7">“ Meantime to do anything to earn their own independence is what father and brothers would deem a disgrace to themselves and their family . For women of high position to work for their livelihood , in most cases custom decrees as disgraceful . And then , if cast down by poverty , they have been trained to nothing that would earn a support , or , if by chance they have some resource , all avenues for its employment are thronged with needy applicants . ”</p>
    <p n="8">This is but a very mild statement of the social fictions under which woman is now suffering in mind , body , and estate ; but it is valuable as coming from a witness who hopes that some less radical remedy than female suffrage will be found for existing evils . If the remedy lies with woman herself , as all admit , how can we expect her to act efficiently until she is a modifying force in legislation ?</p>
    <p n="9">PAGE 65 .</p>
    <p n="10">“ Unions , no priest , no church can sanctify . ”</p>
    <p n="11">“ The most absurd notions , ” says J . A. St. John , “ have prevailed on the subject of matrimony . Marriage , it is said , is a divine institution , therefore marriages are made in heaven ; but the consequence does not at all follow ; the meaning of the former proposition simply being that God originally ordained that men and women should be united in wedlock ; but that he determined what particular men and women should be united , every day 's experience proves to be false . It is admitted on all hands that marriage is intended to confer happiness on those who wed. Now , if it be found that marriage does not confer happiness on them , it is an undoubted proof that they ought not to have been united , and that the sooner they separate the better ; but from accepting this doctrine some persons are deterred by misrepresentations of scripture , others by views of policy , and others again by an entire indifference to human happiness . They regard men and women as mere animals , and , provided they have children , and rear them , nothing more . ”</p>
    <p n="12">“ It is incredible , ” says Milton , “ how cold , how dull , and far from all fellow-feeling we are , without the spur of self-concernment ! ”</p>
    <p n="13">PAGE 72 .</p>
    <p n="14">“ Behold the world 's ideal of a wife ! ”</p>
    <p n="15">“ All women , ” says John Stuart Mill , “ are brought up from their very earliest years in the belief that their ideal character is the very opposite to that of man ; not self-will and self-government by self-control , but submission and yielding to the control of others .... What is now called the nature of women is an eminently artificial thing ,— the result of forced repression in some directions , unnatural stimulation in others . ”</p>
    <p n="16">The cowardice that is looked upon as disgraceful in a man is regarded by many as rather honorable than otherwise in a woman . False notions , inherited from chivalrous times , and growing out of the state of subjection in which woman has been bred , have generated this inconsistency . The truth is that courage is honorable to both sexes ; to a Grace Darling and an Ida Lewis , a Madame Roland and a Florence Nightingale , as well as to a Bayard and a Shaw , a Napoleon and a Farragut .</p>
    <p n="17">PAGE 73 .</p>
    <p n="18">“ That moment should the intimate relations Of marriage end , and a release be found ! ”</p>
    <p n="19">In the United States the action of certain State legislatures , in increasing the facilities for divorce , has been a subject of alarm among persons bred under the influences of a more conservative system . It would be difficult to show as yet whether social morality is harmed or helped by the increased freedom . Nothing can be more deceptive and unsatisfactory than the statistics offered on both sides of the question . It is generally admitted , we believe , that in those countries where divorce is most difficult , the number of illegitimate births is largest , and the reputation of married women is most questionable . In the nature of things , much of the prevalent immorality being furtive and clandestine , it is impossible to estimate the extent of the evils growing out of illiberal laws in relation to matrimony . In any legislation on the subject women should have a voice .</p>
    <p n="20">PAGE 80 .</p>
    <p n="21">“ Unlike the Church , I look on marriage as A civil contract , not a sacrament . ”</p>
    <p n="22">Kenrick here refers of course to the Catholic Church , whose theory of marriage , namely , that it is a sacrament and indissoluble , when once contracted according to the forms of the Church , still influences the legislation and social prejudices of Protestant communities in respect to their own religious forms of marriage . It was not till the twelfth century , and under the auspices of Pope Innocent III ., that divorce was prohibited by the civil as well as the canon law . But it is only a marriage between Catholics that is indissoluble under the Catholic system . In the case of a marriage of Protestants , the tie is not regarded as binding . A dissolution was actually granted in such a case where one of the parties turned Catholic , in 1857 , by the bishop of Rio Janeiro , who pronounced an uncanonical marriage null and void . Modern legislation in establishing the validity of civil marriages aimed a severe blow at ecclesiastical privilege .</p>
    <p n="23">To Rome and not to the Bible we must go for all the authority we can produce for denying that marriage is simply a civil contract . The form , binding one man to one woman , had its origin outside of the Bible . Up to the time of Charlemagne in the eighth century , polygamy and concubinage were common among Christians and countenanced by the Church . Even Luther seems to have had somewhat lax , though not unscriptural , notions on the subject . When Philip , landgrave of Hesse-Cassel , wanted to take another wife , and threatened to get a dispensation from the Pope for the purpose , Luther convoked a synod , composed of six of his proselytes , who declared that marriage is merely a civil contract ; that they could find no passage in the Holy Scriptures ordaining monogamy ; and they consequently signed a decree permitting Philip to take a second wife without repudiating his first .</p>
    <p n="24">In that reconstruction of laws , threatened by the movement in behalf of female suffrage , it is not probable that the patriarchal institution of polygamy will be regarded otherwise than as debasing to both sexes ; but perhaps a greater latitude of divorce will be sought as not inconsistent with public morality . Looking at the question abstractly , and apart from all religious and social prejudice , it certainly seems the height of cruelty and absurdity to compel parties to keep up the relations of man and wife when one of them feels towards the other either a physical repugnance or a moral dislike . The impediments often raised by our courts in the way of divorce are gross relics of barbarism , and will be abolished by a higher legislative morality .</p>
    <p n="25">“ Whoso , ” says Milton , “ prefers either matrimony or other ordinance before the good of man and the plain exigence of charity , let him profess Papist or Protestant or what he will , he is no better than a pharisee , and understands not the gospel ; whom , as a misinterpreter of Christ , I openly protest against . ” And , in another passage , he rebukes those who would rest “ in the mere element of the text , ” as favoring “ the policy of the Devil to make that gracious ordinance ( of marriage ) become insupportable , that what with men not daring to venture upon wedlock , and what with men wearied out of it , all inordinate license might abound . ”</p>
    <p n="26">Mr. J . A. St. John , editor of the Prose Works of Milton , remarks in reference to the marriage law as it now stands in England :—</p>
    <p n="27">“ Having been invented and established by men , it is calculated to bear with extreme severity on women , who are daily subjected to wrongs and hardships which they would not endure , were the relief of divorce open to them . Those who take a different view descant upon the encouragement which would , they say , be given to immorality were divorce made easy . But the contrary is the truth .</p>
    <p n="28">“ It is in behalf of morals , and for the sake of imparting a higher tone to the feelings of society , that the present unnatural system should be abolished . Where , what Milton calls , an unconjugal mind exists , there must be unconjugal manners ; and to what these lead no one need be told . Where marriage is indissoluble , people presume upon that fact to transgress its laws , which they would not do were it legally practicable to obtain immediate redress .</p>
    <p n="29">“ However , there is a great indisposition in mankind to innovate in legislation ; and they had generally rather be miserable according to rule than free and happy on a novel principle .... Whenever it clearly appears that man and wife can no longer live together in peace and harmony , their separation would be far more beneficial to themselves and favorable to morals , than their compulsory union . Milton 's notions of married life are highly flattering to women , whom he evidently contemplates as the equal companions of men . ”</p>

    <p n="31">“ Give her the suffrage . ”</p>
    <p n="32">In one of his pamphlets in behalf of women 's suffrage , Professor F. W. Newman of England , a man of widest culture and noblest sympathies , and always among the ablest and foremost in good works , remarks : “ It is useless to reply that women have not political knowledge . Hitherto they have had little motive to acquire it . But how much of such knowledge have those male voters had , whom , for two hundred years past , candidates for the place of M. P. have made drunk in the tippling-houses ? The arguments used against female suffrage simply show that there is nothing valid to be said . Women have , prima facie , the same right as men . ”</p>

    <p n="34">“ Not by evading or profaning Nature . ”</p>
    <p n="35">In his recent “ History of European Morals , ” Mr. Lecky , referring to the fact that the prevalent doctrine is , that the very highest interest of society is not to stimulate but to restrain multiplication , diminishing the number of marriages and of children , presents the following comments :—</p>
    <p n="36">“ In consequence of this belief , and of the many factitious wants that accompany a luxurious civilization , a very large and increasing proportion of women are left to make their way in life without any male protector , and the difficulties they have to encounter through physical weakness have been most unnaturally and most fearfully aggravated by laws and customs which , resting on the old assumption that every woman should be a wife , habitually deprive them of the pecuniary and educational advantages of men , exclude them absolutely from very many of the employments in which they might earn a subsistence , encumber their course in others by a heartless ridicule or by a steady disapprobation , and consign , in consequence , many thousands to the most extreme and agonizing poverty , and perhaps a still larger number to the paths of vice .</p>
    <p n="37">“ At the same time a momentous revolution , the effects of which can as yet be but imperfectly descried , has taken place in the chief spheres of female industry that remain . The progress of machinery has destroyed its domestic character . The distaff has fallen from the hand . The needle is being rapidly superseded , and the work which , from the days of Homer to the present century , was accomplished in the centre of the family , has been transferred to the crowded manufactory . ”</p>
    <p n="38">The necessity of those reforms which many noble women are now urging upon public attention is clearly set forth in eloquent facts like these .</p>
    <p n="39">PAGE 198 .</p>
    <p n="40">“ Is against nature . ”</p>
    <p n="41">A curious instance of the temerity with which flagrant errors are pressed into the service of criticism is presented in some remarks in the N. Y . Nation . “ There is probably , ” it says , “ no incident of woman 's condition which is more clearly natural than her passivity in all that relates to marriage . In waiting to be wooed , she not only complies with one of the conventional proprieties , but obeys what appears to be a law of sex , not amongst human beings only , but among all animals . ”</p>
    <p n="42">These remarks have been adopted by many American journalists , and have been accepted perhaps by many readers as settling the whole question with scientific accuracy and force , so far as analogies drawn from the habits of the lower animals can settle it . But if the critic , while buttering his daily bread or putting cream into his daily coffee , had acquainted himself with the habits of the useful animal to which he is indebted , he would never have been guilty of so prodigious a blunder . So far from passively “ waiting to be wooed , ” the cow , when the sexual impulse is awakened , will disturb the whole neighborhood by her bellowings . Should the critic reply that this is because she is kept in an unnatural state of restraint , such reply would add only additional force to the contradiction of the argument which he would offer .</p>
    <p n="43">Other examples in abundance , in confutation of his assumption , could no doubt be furnished . But even were that assumption true , we might sometimes be led to rather awkward results if we were to take the habits of the lower animals as authoritative . Certain animals have not infrequently an eccentric habit of destroying their offspring . Some of our Chinese brethren , borrowing a hint perhaps from the brute creation , are said to think it no sin to kill such female children as they have no use for . We hope that no enterprising critic will recommend such a solution as this of the woman problem .</p>
