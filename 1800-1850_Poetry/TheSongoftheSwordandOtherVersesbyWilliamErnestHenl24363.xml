     <l n="2">Forth from the dust and din ,</l>
     <l n="3">The crush , the heat , the many-spotted glare ,</l>
     <l n="4">The odour and sense of life and lust aflare ,</l>
     <l n="5">The wrangle and jangle of unrests ,</l>
     <l n="6">Let us take horse , dear heart , take horse and win —</l>
     <l n="7">As from swart August to the green lap of May —</l>
     <l n="8">To quietness and the fresh and fragrant breasts</l>
     <l n="9">Of the still , delicious night , not yet aware</l>
     <l n="10">In any of her innumerable nests</l>
     <l n="11">Of that first sudden plash of dawn ,</l>
     <l n="12">Clear , sapphirine , luminous , large ,</l>
     <l n="13">Which tells that soon the flowing springs of day</l>
     <l n="14">In deep and ever deeper eddies drawn</l>
     <l n="15">Forward and up , in wider and wider way</l>
     <l n="16">Shall float the sands and brim the shores</l>
     <l n="17">On this our haunch of Earth , as round she roars</l>
     <l n="18">And spins into the outlook of the Sun</l>
     <l n="19">( The Lord 's first gift , the Lord 's especial charge )</l>
     <l n="20">With light , with living light , from marge to marge ,</l>
     <l n="21">Until the course He set and staked be run .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="22">Through street and square , through square and street ,</l>
     <l n="23">Each with his home-grown quality of dark</l>
     <l n="24">And violated silence , loud and fleet ,</l>
     <l n="25">Waylaid by a merry ghost at every lamp ,</l>
     <l n="26">The hansom wheels and plunges . Hark , O hark ,</l>
     <l n="27">Sweet , how the old mare 's bit and chain</l>
     <l n="28">Ring back a rough refrain</l>
     <l n="29">Upon the marked and cheerful tramp</l>
     <l n="30">Of her four shoes ! Here is the Park ,</l>
     <l n="31">And O the languid midsummer wafts adust ,</l>
     <l n="32">The tired midsummer blooms !</l>
     <l n="33">O the mysterious distances , the glooms</l>
     <l n="34">Romantic , the august</l>
     <l n="35">And solemn shapes ! At night this City of Trees</l>
     <l n="36">Tunis to a tryst of vague and strange</l>
     <l n="37">And monstrous Majesties ,</l>
     <l n="38">Let loose from some dim underworld to range</l>
     <l n="39">These terrene vistas till their twilight sets :</l>
     <l n="40">When , dispossessed of wonderfulness , they stand</l>
     <l n="41">Beggared and common , plain to all the land</l>
     <l n="42">For stooks of leaves ! And lo ! the wizard hour</l>
     <l n="43">Whose shining , silent sorcery hath such power !</l>
     <l n="44">Still , still the streets , between their carcanets</l>
     <l n="45">Of linking gold , are avenues of sleep :</l>
     <l n="46">But see how gable ends and parapets</l>
     <l n="47">In gradual beauty and significance</l>
     <l n="48">Emerge ! And did you hear</l>
     <l n="49">That little twitter-and-cheep ,</l>
     <l n="50">Breaking inordinately loud and clear</l>
     <l n="51">On this still , spectral , exquisite atmosphere ?</l>
     <l n="52">‘ Tis a first nest at matins ! And behold</l>
     <l n="53">A rakehell cat — how furtive and acold !</l>
     <l n="54">A spent witch homing from some infamous dance —</l>
     <l n="55">Obscene , quick-trotting , see her tip and fade</l>
     <l n="56">Through shadowy railings into a pit of shade !</l>
     <l n="57">And lo ! a little wind and shy ,</l>
     <l n="58">The smell of ships ( that earnest of romance ) ,</l>
     <l n="59">A sense of space and water , and thereby</l>
     <l n="60">A lamplit bridge ouching the troubled sky .</l>
     <l n="61">And look , O look ! a tangle of silver gleams</l>
     <l n="62">And dusky lights , our River and all his dreams ,</l>
     <l n="63">His dreams of a dead past that cannot die !</l>

     <l n="64">What miracle is happening in the air ,</l>
     <l n="65">Charging the very texture of the gray</l>

     <l n="67">The night goes out like an ill-parcelled fire ,</l>
     <l n="68">And , as one lights a candle , it is day .</l>
     <l n="69">The extinguisher that fain would strut for spire</l>
     <l n="70">On the formal little church is not yet green</l>
     <l n="71">Across the water : but the house-tops nigher ,</l>
     <l n="72">The corner-lines , the chimneys — look how clean ,</l>
     <l n="73">How new , how naked ! See the batch of boats ,</l>
     <l n="74">Here at the stairs , washed in the fresh-sprung beam !</l>
     <l n="75">And those are barges that were goblin floats ,</l>
     <l n="76">Black , hag-steered , fraught with devilry and dream !</l>
     <l n="77">And in the piles the water frolics clear ,</l>
     <l n="78">The ripples into loose rings wander and flee ,</l>
     <l n="79">And we — we can behold that could but hear</l>
     <l n="80">The ancient River singing as he goes</l>
     <l n="81">New-mailed in morning to the ancient Sea .</l>
     <l n="82">The gas burns lank and jaded in its glass :</l>
     <l n="83">The old Ruffian soon shall yawn himself awake ,</l>
     <l n="84">And light his pipe , and shoulder his tools , and take</l>
     <l n="85">His hobnailed way to work !</l>
     <l n="86">Let us too pass :</l>
     <l n="87">Through these long blindfold rows</l>
     <l n="88">Of casements staring blind to right and left ,</l>
     <l n="89">Each with his gaze turned inward on some piece</l>
     <l n="90">Of life in death 's own likeness — Life bereft</l>
     <l n="91">Of living looks as by the Great Release</l>
     <l n="92">( Perchance of shadow-shapes from shadow-shows ) ,</l>
     <l n="93">Whose upshot all men know yet no man knows .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="94">Reach upon reach of burial — so they feel ,</l>

     <l n="96">Homeward together , but for the buxom breeze</l>
     <l n="97">That frolics at our heel ,</l>
     <l n="98">Greeting the town with news of the summer seas ,</l>
