A record of the previous publication of the poems will be found in the bibliographical notes prefixed to the various sections of the present book .

   <head>ARGUMENT</head>
   <p>Prometheus coming on earth to give fire to men appears before the palace of Inachus in Argos on a festival of Zeus . He interrupts the ceremony by announcing fire and persuades Inachus to dare the anger of Zeus and accept the gift . Inachus fetching Argeia his wife from the palace has in turn to quiet her fears . He asks a prophecy of Prometheus who foretells the fate of Io their daughter . Prometheus then setting flame to the altar and writing his own name thereon in the place of Zeus disappears .</p>
   <p>The Chorus sing ( 1 ) a Hymn to Zeus with the stories of the birth of Zeus and the marriage of Hera with the dances of the Curetes and the Hesperides , ( 2 ) their anticipation of fire with an Ode on Wonder , ( 3 ) a Tragic Hymn on the lot of man , ( 4 ) a Fire-chorus , ( 5 ) a final Chorus in praise of Prometheus .</p>
   <p>All the characters are good . Prometheus prologizes . He carries a long reed .</p>

    <head>PROMETHEUS .</head>
     <l n="1">From high Olympus and the A | therial courts ,</l>
     <l n="2">Where mighty Zeus our angry king confirms</l>
     <l n="3">The Fates ’ decrees and bends the wills of the gods ,</l>
     <l n="4">I come : and on the earth step with glad foot .</l>
     <l n="5">This variegated ocean-floor of the air ,</l>
     <l n="6">The changeful circle of fair land , that lies</l>
     <l n="7">Heaven 's dial , sisterly mirror of night and day :</l>
     <l n="8">The wide o'erhYpppHeNwandered plain , this nether world</l>
     <l n="9">My truant haunt is , when from jealous eyes</l>
     <l n="10">I steal , for hither ‘ tis I steal , and here 10</l>
     <l n="11">Unseen repair my joy : yet not unseen</l>
     <l n="12">Methinks , nor seen unguessed of him I seek .</l>
     <l n="13">Rather by swath or furrow , or where the path</l>
     <l n="14">Is walled with corn I am found , by trellised vine</l>
     <l n="15">Or olive set in banks or orchard trim :</l>
     <l n="16">I watch all toil and tilth , farm , field and fold ,</l>
     <l n="17">And taste the mortal joy ; since not in heaven</l>
     <l n="18">Among our easeful gods hath facile time</l>
     <l n="19">A touch so keen , to wake such love of life</l>
     <l n="20">As stirs the frail and careful being , who here , 20</l>
     <l n="21">The king of sorrows , melancholy man ,</l>
     <l n="22">Bows at his labour , but in heart erect</l>
     <l n="23">A god stands , nor for any gift of god</l>
     <l n="24">Would barter his immortal-hearted prime .</l>
     <l n="25">Could I but win this world from Zeus for mine ,</l>
     <l n="26">With not a god to vex my happy rule ,</l>
     <l n="27">I would inhabit here and leave high heaven :</l>
     <l n="28">So much I love it and its race of men ,</l>
     <l n="29">Even as he hates them , hates both them , and me</l>
     <l n="30">For loving what he hates , and would destroy me , 30</l>
     <l n="31">Outcast in the scorn of all his cringing crew ,</l>
     <l n="32">For daring but to save what he would slay :</l>
     <l n="33">And me must first destroy . Thus he denieth</l>
     <l n="34">My heart 's wish , thus my counsel sets at naught ,</l>
     <l n="35">Which him saved once , when all at stake he stood</l>
     <l n="36">Uprisen in rebellion to overthrow</l>
     <l n="37">The elderseated Titans , for I that day</l>
     <l n="38">Gave him the counsels which his foes despised .</l>
     <l n="39">Unhappy they , who had still their blissful seats</l>
     <l n="40">Preserved and their Olympian majesty , 40</l>
     <l n="41">Had they been one with me . Alas , my kin !</l>
     <l n="42">But he , when he had taken the throne and chained</l>
     <l n="43">His foes in wasteful Tartarus , said no more</l>
     <l n="44">Where is Prometheus our wise counsellor ?</l>
     <l n="45">What saith Prometheus ? tell us , O Prometheus ,</l>
     <l n="46">What Fate requires ! but waxing confident</l>
     <l n="47">And wanton , as a youth first tasting power ,</l>
     <l n="48">He wrecked the timeless monuments of heaven ,</l>
     <l n="49">The witness of the wisdom of the gods ,</l>
     <l n="50">And making all about him new , beyond 50</l>
     <l n="51">Determined to destroy the race of men ,</l>
     <l n="52">And that create afresh or else have none .</l>
     <l n="53">Then his vain mind imagined a device ,</l>
     <l n="54">And at his bidding all the opposA " d winds</l>
     <l n="55">Blew , and the scattered clouds and furlA " d snows ,</l>
     <l n="56">From every part of heaven together flying ,</l>
     <l n="57">He with brute hands in huge disorder heaped :</l>
     <l n="58">They with the winds ’ weight and his angry breath</l>
     <l n="59">Were thawed : in cataracts they fell , and earth</l>
     <l n="60">In darkness deep and whelmA " d tempest lay , 60</l>
     <l n="61">Drowned ‘ neath the waters . Yet on the mountain-tops</l>
     <l n="62">Some few escaped , and some , thus warned by me ,</l>
     <l n="63">Made shift to live in vessels which outrode</l>
     <l n="64">The season and the fury of the flood .</l>
     <l n="65">And when his rain was spent and from clear skies</l>
     <l n="66">Zeus looking down upon the watery world ,</l>
     <l n="67">Beheld these few , the remnant of mankind ,</l>
     <l n="68">Who yet stood up and breathed ; he next withdrew</l>
     <l n="69">The seeds of fire , that else had still lain hid</l>
     <l n="70">In withered branch and the blue flakes of flint 70</l>
     <l n="71">For man to exact and use , but these withdrawn ,</l>
     <l n="72">Man with the brutes degraded would be man</l>
     <l n="73">No more ; and so the tyrant was content .</l>
     <l n="74">But I , despised again , again upheld</l>
     <l n="75">The weak , and pitying them sent sweet Hope ,</l>
     <l n="76">Bearer of dreams , enchantress fond and kind ,</l>
     <l n="77">From heaven descending on the unhindered rays</l>
     <l n="78">Of every star , to cheer with visions fair</l>
     <l n="79">Their unamending pains . And now this day</l>
     <l n="80">Behold I come bearing the seal of all 80</l>
     <l n="81">Which Hope had promised : for within this reed</l>
     <l n="82">A prisoner I bring them stolen from heaven ,</l>
     <l n="83">The flash of mastering fire , and it have borne</l>
     <l n="84">So swift to earth , that when yon noontide sun</l>
     <l n="85">Rose from the sea at morning I was by ,</l>
     <l n="86">And unperceived of HAªlios plunged the point</l>
     <l n="87">I ’ the burning axle , and withdrew a tongue</l>
     <l n="88">Of breathing flame , which lives to leap on earth</l>
     <l n="89">For man the father of all fire to come .</l>
     <l n="90">And hither have I brought it even to Argos 90</l>
     <l n="91">Unto king Inachus , him having chosen</l>
     <l n="92">Above all mortals to receive my gift :</l>
     <l n="93">For he is hopeful , careful , wise , and brave .</l>
     <l n="94">He first , when first the floods left bare the land ,</l>
     <l n="95">Grew warm with enterprise , and gathered men</l>
     <l n="96">Together , and disposed their various tasks</l>
     <l n="97">For common weal combined ; for soon were seen</l>
     <l n="98">The long straight channels dwindling on the plain ,</l>
     <l n="99">Which slow from stagnant pool and wide morass</l>
     <l n="100">The pestilent waters to the rivers bore : 100</l>
     <l n="101">Then in the ruined dwellings and old tombs</l>
     <l n="102">He dug , unbedding from the wormA " d ooze</l>
     <l n="103">Vessels and tools of trade and husbandry ;</l>
     <l n="104">Wherewith , all seasonable works restored ,</l>
     <l n="105">Oil made he and wine anew , and taught mankind</l>
     <l n="106">To live not brutally though without fire ,</l>
     <l n="107">Tending their flocks and herds and weaving wool ,</l>
     <l n="108">Living on fruit and milk and shepherds ’ fare ,</l>
     <l n="109">Till time should bring back flame to smithy and hearth ,</l>
     <l n="110">Or Zeus relent . Now at these gates I stand , 110</l>
     <l n="111">At this mid hour , when Inachus comes forth</l>
     <l n="112">To offer sacrifice unto his foe .</l>
     <l n="113">For never hath his faithful zeal forborne</l>
     <l n="114">To pay the power , though hard , that rules the world</l>
     <l n="115">The smokeless sacrifice ; which first to-day</l>
     <l n="116">Shall smoke , and rise at heaven in flame to brave</l>
     <l n="117">The baffled god . See here a servant bears</l>
     <l n="118">For the cold altar ceremonial wood :</l>

     <l n="1">I am the King of Hell , nor prone to vex</l>

     <l n="18">I claimed from Zeus that of the fair immortals</l>
     <l n="19">One should be given to me to grace my throne .</l>
     <l n="20">Willing he was , and quick to praise my rule , 20</l>
     <l n="21">And of mere justice there had granted me</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">When men were all asleep the snow came flying ,</l>
     <l n="2">In large white flakes falling on the city brown ,</l>
     <l n="3">Stealthily and perpetually settling and loosely lying ,</l>
     <l n="4">Hushing the latest traffic of the drowsy town ;</l>
     <l n="5">Deadening , muffling , stifling its murmurs failing ;</l>
     <l n="6">Lazily and incessantly floating down and down :</l>
     <l n="7">Silently sifting and veiling road , roof and railing ;</l>
     <l n="8">Hiding difference , making unevenness even ,</l>
     <l n="9">Into angles and crevices softly drifting and sailing .</l>
     <l n="10">All night it fell , and when full inches seven</l>
     <l n="11">It lay in the depth of its uncompacted lightness ,</l>
     <l n="12">The clouds blew off from a high and frosty heaven ;</l>
     <l n="13">And all woke earlier for the unaccustomed brightness</l>
     <l n="14">Of the winter dawning , the strange unheavenly glare :</l>
     <l n="15">The eye marvelled — marvelled at the dazzling whiteness ;</l>
     <l n="16">The ear hearkened to the stillness of the solemn air ;</l>
     <l n="17">No sound of wheel rumbling nor of foot falling ,</l>
     <l n="18">And the busy morning cries came thin and spare .</l>
     <l n="19">Then boys I heard , as they went to school , calling ,</l>
     <l n="20">They gathered up the crystal manna to freeze</l>
     <l n="21">Their tongues with tasting , their hands with snowballing ;</l>
     <l n="22">Or rioted in a drift , plunging up to the knees ;</l>
     <l n="23">Or peering up from under the white-mossed wonder ,</l>
     <l n="24">‘ O look at the trees ! ’ they cried , ‘ O look at the trees ! ’</l>
     <l n="25">With lessened load a few carts creak and blunder ,</l>
     <l n="26">Following along the white deserted way ,</l>
     <l n="27">A country company long dispersed asunder :</l>
     <l n="28">When now already the sun , in pale display</l>
     <l n="29">Standing by Paul 's high dome , spread forth below</l>
     <l n="30">His sparkling beams , and awoke the stir of the day .</l>
     <l n="31">For now doors open , and war is waged with the snow ;</l>
     <l n="32">And trains of sombre men , past tale of number ,</l>
     <l n="33">Tread long brown paths , as toward their toil they go :</l>
     <l n="34">But even for them awhile no cares encumber</l>
     <l n="35">Their minds diverted ; the daily word is unspoken ,</l>
     <l n="36">The daily thoughts of labour and sorrow slumber</l>
     <l n="37">At the sight of the beauty that greets them , for the charm</l>

   <p>ASIAN BIRDS</p>
   <p>In this May-month , by grace of heaven , things shoot apace . The waiting multitude of fair boughs in the wood , How few days have arrayed their beauty in green shade .</p>
   <p>What have I seen or heard ? it was the yellow bird Sang in the tree : he flew a flame against the blue ; Upward he flashed . Again , hark ! ‘ tis his heavenly strain .</p>
   <p>Another ! Hush ! Behold , many , like boats of gold , From waving branch to branch their airy bodies launch . What music is like this , where each note is a kiss ?</p>
   <p>The golden willows lift their boughs the sun to sift : Their sprays they droop to screen the sky with veils of green , A floating cage of song , where feathered lovers throng .</p>
   <p>How the delicious notes come bubbling from their throats ! Full and sweet how they are shed like round pearls from a thread ! The motions of their flight are wishes of delight .</p>
   <p>Hearing their song I trace the secret of their grace . Ah , could I this fair time so fashion into rhyme , The poem that I sing would be the voice of spring .</p>

    <head>THE MONTHS</head>
    <head>BASIL AND EDWARD</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Man hath with man on earth no holier bond</l>
     <l n="2">Than that the Muse weaves with her dreamy thread :</l>
     <l n="3">Nor e'er was such transcendent love more fond</l>
     <l n="4">Than that which Edward unto Basil led ,</l>
     <l n="5">Wandering alone across the woody shires</l>
     <l n="6">To hear the living voice of that wide heart ,</l>
     <l n="7">To see the eyes that read the world 's desires ,</l>
     <l n="8">And touch the hand that wrote the roving rhyme .</l>
     <l n="9">Diverse their lots as distant were their homes ,</l>
     <l n="10">And since that early meeting , jealous Time</l>
     <l n="11">Knitting their loves had held their lives apart .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="12">But now again were these fine lovers met</l>
     <l n="13">And sat together on a rocky hill</l>
     <l n="14">Looking upon the vales of Somerset ,</l>
     <l n="15">Where the far sea gleam 'd o'er the bosky combes ,</l>
     <l n="16">Satisfying their spirits the livelong day</l>
     <l n="17">With various mirth and revelation due</l>
     <l n="18">And delicate intimacy of delight ,</l>
     <l n="19">As there in happy indolence they lay</l>
     <l n="20">And drank the sun , while round the breezy height</l>
     <l n="21">Beneath their feet rabbit and listless ewe</l>
     <l n="22">Nibbled the scented herb and grass at will .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="23">Much talked they at their ease ; and at the last</l>
     <l n="24">Spoke Edward thus , ‘'Twas on this very hill</l>
     <l n="25">This time of the year ,— but now twelve years are past ,—</l>
     <l n="26">That you provoked in verse my younger skill</l>
     <l n="27">To praise the months against your rival song ;</l>
     <l n="28">And ere the sun had westered ten degrees</l>
     <l n="29">Our rhyme had brought him thro ’ the Zodiac .</l>
     <l n="30">Have you remembered ? ’ — Basil answer 'd back ,</l>
     <l n="31">‘ Guest of my solace , how could I forget ?</l>
     <l n="32">Years fly as months that seem 'd in youth so long .</l>
     <l n="33">The precious life that , like indifferent gold ,</l>
     <l n="34">Is disregarded in its worth to hold</l>
     <l n="35">Some jewel of love that God therein would set ,</l>
     <l n="36">It passeth and is gone . ’ — ‘ And yet not all , ’</l>
     <l n="37">Edward replied : ‘ The passion as I please</l>
     <l n="38">Of that past day I can to-day recall ;</l>
     <l n="39">And if but you , as I , remember yet</l>
     <l n="40">Your part thereof , and will again rehearse ,</l>
     <l n="41">For half an hour we may old Time outwit . ’</l>
     <l n="42">And Basil said , ‘ Alas for my poor verse !</l>
     <l n="43">What happy memory of it still endures</l>
     <l n="44">Will thank your love : I have forgotten it .</l>
     <l n="45">Speak you my stanzas , I will ransom yours .</l>
     <l n="46">Begin you then as I that day began ,</l>
     <l n="47">And I will follow as your answers ran . ’</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>JANUARY</head>
     <l n="1">ED . The moon that mounts the sun 's deserted way ,</l>
     <l n="2">Turns the long winter night to a silver day ;</l>
     <l n="3">But setteth golden in face of the solemn sight</l>
     <l n="4">Of her lord arising upon a world of white .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>FEBRUARY</head>
     <l n="1">BA . I have in my heart a vision of spring begun</l>
     <l n="2">In a sheltering wood , that feels the kiss of the sun :</l>
     <l n="3">And a thrush adoreth the melting day that dies</l>
     <l n="4">In clouds of purple afloat upon saffron skies .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>MARCH</head>
     <l n="1">ED . Now carol the birds at dawn , and some new lay</l>
     <l n="2">Announceth a homecome voyager every day .</l>
     <l n="3">Beneath the tufted sallows the streamlet thrills</l>
     <l n="4">With the leaping trout and the gleam of the daffodils .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>APRIL</head>
     <l n="1">BA . Then laugheth the year ; with flowers the meads are bright ;</l>
     <l n="2">The bursting branches are tipped with flames of light :</l>
     <l n="3">The landscape is light ; the dark clouds flee above ,</l>
     <l n="4">And the shades of the land are a blue that is deep as love .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>MAY</head>
     <l n="1">ED . But if you have seen a village all red and old</l>
     <l n="2">In cherry-orchards a-sprinkle with white and gold ,</l>
     <l n="3">By a hawthorn seated , or a witch-elm flowering high ,</l>
     <l n="4">A gay breeze making riot in the waving rye !</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>JUNE</head>
     <l n="1">BA . Then night retires from heaven ; the high winds go</l>
     <l n="2">A-sailing in cloud-pavilions of cavern 'd snow .</l>
     <l n="3">O June , sweet Philomel sang thy cradle-lay ;</l>
     <l n="4">In rosy revel thy spirit shall pass away .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>JULY</head>
     <l n="1">ED . Heavy is the green of the fields , heavy the trees</l>
     <l n="2">With foliage hang , drowsy the hum of bees</l>
     <l n="3">In the thund'rous air : the crowded scents lie low :</l>
     <l n="4">Thro ’ tangle of weeds the river runneth slow .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>AUGUST</head>
     <l n="1">BA . A reaper with dusty shoon and hat of straw</l>
     <l n="2">On the yellow field , his scythe in his armA " s braw :</l>
     <l n="3">Beneath the tall grey trees resting at noon</l>
     <l n="4">From sweat and swink with scythe and dusty shoon .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>SEPTEMBER</head>
     <l n="1">ED . Earth 's flaunting flower of passion fadeth fair</l>
     <l n="2">To ripening fruit in sunlit veils of the air ,</l>
     <l n="3">As the art of man makes wisdom to glorify</l>
     <l n="4">The beauty and love of life born else to die .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>OCTOBER</head>
     <l n="1">BA . On frosty morns with the woods aflame , down , down</l>
     <l n="2">The golden spoils fall thick from the chestnut crown .</l>
     <l n="3">May Autumn in tranquil glory her riches spend ,</l>
     <l n="4">With mellow apples her orchard-branches bend .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>NOVEMBER</head>
     <l n="1">ED . Sad mists have hid the sun , the land is forlorn :</l>
     <l n="2">The plough is afield , the hunter windeth his horn .</l>
     <l n="3">Dame Prudence looketh well to her winter stores ,</l>
     <l n="4">And many a wise man finds his pleasure indoors .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>DECEMBER</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">BA . I pray thee don thy jerkin of olden time ,</l>
     <l n="2">Bring us good ice , and silver the trees with rime ;</l>
     <l n="3">And I will good cheer , good music and wine bestow ,</l>
     <l n="4">When the Christmas guest comes galloping over the snow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Thus they in verse alternate sang the year</l>
     <l n="6">For rabbit shy and listless ewe to hear ,</l>
     <l n="7">Among the grey rocks on the mountain green</l>
     <l n="8">Beneath the sky in fair and pastoral scene ,</l>
     <l n="9">Like those Sicilian swains , whose doric tongue</l>
     <l n="10">After two thousand years is ever young ,—</l>
     <l n="11">Sweet the pine 's murmur , and , shepherd , sweet thy pipe ,—</l>
     <l n="12">Or that which gentle Virgil , yet unripe ,</l>
     <l n="13">Of Tityrus sang under the spreading beech</l>
     <l n="14">And gave to rustic clowns immortal speech ,</l>
     <l n="15">By rocky fountain or on flowery mead</l>
     <l n="16">Bidding their idle flocks at will to feed ,</l>
     <l n="17">While they , retreated to some bosky glade ,</l>
     <l n="18">Together told their loves , and as they played</l>
     <l n="19">Sang what sweet thing soe'er the poet feigned :</l>
     <l n="20">But these were men when good Victoria reigned ,</l>
     <l n="21">Poets themselves , who without shepherd gear</l>
     <l n="22">Each of his native fancy sang the year .</l>

     <l n="1">Look down the river — against the western sky —</l>
     <l n="2">The Ponte Santa TrinitA — what throng</l>
     <l n="3">Slowly trails o'er with waving banners high ,</l>
     <l n="4">With foot and horse ! Surely they bear along</l>
     <l n="5">The spoil of one whom Florence honoureth :</l>

    <head>RICHARD</head>
     <l n="1">I can tell</l>

     <l n="3">Prenticed to cut his father 's rude designs</l>
     <l n="4">( We have it from himself ) , maker of shrines ,</l>
     <l n="5">In his mean workshop in Siena dreamed ;</l>
     <l n="6">And saw as gods the artists of the earth ,</l>

     <l n="6">Where he profess 'd nor doubted to excel ,</l>
     <l n="7">Now , where he had no scholarship , but drew</l>

     <l n="2">Voyaging northwards by the western strand</l>
     <l n="3">Of the Euxine sea we came to where the land</l>

     <l n="5">Here mighty Ister pushes to the main ,</l>

     <l n="25">Else all is desert , uninhabited ;</l>

     <l n="35">Inscriptions , with the givers ’ names thereto ,</l>
     <l n="36">Some in Romaic character , some Greek ,</l>

     <l n="42">Thousands of birds frequent the sheltering shrine ,</l>
     <l n="43">The dippers and the swimmers of the brine ,</l>
     <l n="44">Sea-mew and gull and diving cormorant ,</l>
     <l n="45">Fishers that on the high cliff make their haunt</l>
     <l n="46">Sheer inaccessible , and sun themselves</l>
     <l n="47">Huddled arow upon the narrow shelves :—</l>
     <l n="48">And surely no like wonder e'er hath been</l>
     <l n="49">As that such birds should keep the temple clean ;</l>
     <l n="50">But thus they do : at earliest dawn of day</l>
     <l n="51">They flock to sea and in the waters play ,</l>
     <l n="52">And when they well have wet their plumage light ,</l>
     <l n="53">Back to the sanctuary they take flight</l>
     <l n="54">Splashing the walls and columns with fresh brine ,</l>
     <l n="55">Till all the stone doth fairly drip and shine ,</l>
     <l n="56">When off again they skim asea for more</l>
     <l n="57">And soon returning sprinkle steps and floor ,</l>

     <l n="62">For oracle there was ,— they sacrificed</l>
     <l n="63">Such victims as they brought , if such sufficed ,</l>
     <l n="64">And some they slew , some to the god set free :</l>
     <l n="65">But they who driven from their course at sea</l>
     <l n="66">Chanced on the isle , took of the goats thereon</l>
     <l n="67">And pray 'd Achilles to accept his own .</l>
     <l n="68">Then made they a gift , and when they had offer 'd once ,</l>
     <l n="69">If to their question there was no response ,</l>
     <l n="70">They added to the gift and asked again ;</l>
     <l n="71">Yea twice and more , until the god should deign</l>
     <l n="72">Answer to give , their offering they renew 'd ;</l>
     <l n="73">Whereby great riches to the shrine ensued .</l>
     <l n="74">And when both sacrifice and gifts were made</l>
     <l n="75">They worship 'd at the shrine , and as they pray 'd</l>
     <l n="76">Sailors aver that often hath been seen</l>
     <l n="77">A man like to a god , of warrior mien ,</l>
     <l n="78">A beauteous form of figure swift and strong ;</l>
     <l n="79">Down on his shoulders his light hair hung long</l>
     <l n="80">And his full armour was enchast with gold :</l>
     <l n="81">While some , who with their eyes might nought behold ,</l>
     <l n="82">Say that with music strange the air was stir 'd ;</l>

     <l n="85">He need but spend one night upon the shore ;</l>
     <l n="86">To him in sleep Achilles will appear</l>
     <l n="87">And lead him to his tent , and with good cheer</l>
     <l n="88">Show him all friendliness that men desire ;</l>
     <l n="89">Patroclus pours the wine , and he his lyre</l>
     <l n="90">Takes from the pole and plays the strains thereon</l>

     <l n="1">Ended are many days , and now but few</l>
     <l n="2">Remain ; since therefore it is happy and true</l>
     <l n="3">That memoried joys keep ever their delight ,</l>
     <l n="4">Like steadfast stars in the blue vault of night ,</l>
     <l n="5">While hours of pain ( among those heavenly spheres</l>
     <l n="6">Like falling meteors , the martyr 's tears )</l>
     <l n="7">Dart their long trails at random , and anon ,</l>
     <l n="8">Ere we exclaim , pass , and for aye are gone ;</l>
     <l n="9">Therefore my heedy thought will oft restore</l>
     <l n="10">The long light-hearted days that are no more ,</l>
     <l n="11">Save where in her memorial crypt they shine</l>

     <l n="13">But why in dream of this enchanted mood</l>
     <l n="14">Should all my boyhood seem a solitude ?</l>
     <l n="15">Good reason know I , when I wander there ,</l>
     <l n="16">In that transmuted scene , why all is fair ;</l>
     <l n="17">The woods as when in holiday of spring</l>
     <l n="18">Million buds burst , and flowers are blossoming ;</l>
     <l n="19">The meadows deep in grass , the fields unshorn</l>
     <l n="20">In beauty of the multitudinous corn ,</l>
     <l n="21">Where the strait alleys hide me , wall 'd between</l>
     <l n="22">High bloomy stalks and rustling banners green ;</l>
     <l n="23">The gardens , too , in dazzling hues full-blown ,</l>
     <l n="24">With wafted scent and blazing petals strewn ;</l>
     <l n="25">The orchards reddening thro ’ the patient hours ,</l>
     <l n="26">While idle autumn in his mossy bowers</l>
     <l n="27">Inviteth meditation to endear</l>
     <l n="28">The sanctuaries of the mellowing year ;</l>
     <l n="29">And every spot wherein I loved to stray</l>
     <l n="30">Hath borrowed radiance of eternal day ;</l>
     <l n="31">But why am I ever alone , alone ?</l>
     <l n="32">Here in the corner of a field my throne ,</l>
     <l n="33">Now in the branching chair of some tall tree</l>
     <l n="34">Drinking the gale in bird-like liberty ;</l>
     <l n="35">Or to the seashore wandered in the sun</l>
     <l n="36">To watch the fateful waves break one by one ;</l>
     <l n="37">Or if on basking downs supine I lie</l>
     <l n="38">Bathing my spirit in blue calms of the sky ;</l>
     <l n="39">Or to the river bank am stolen by night</l>
     <l n="40">Hearkening unto the moonlit ripple bright</l>
     <l n="41">That warbles o'er the shallows of smooth stone ;</l>
     <l n="42">Why should my memory find me all alone ,</l>
     <l n="43">When I had such companions every day</l>
     <l n="44">Jocund and dear ? ‘ Twixt glimpses of their play</l>
     <l n="45">‘ Tis a vast solitude , wherein I see</l>

   <p>A VIGNETTE</p>
   <p>Among the meadows lightly going , With worship and joy my heart o'erflowing ,</p>
   <p>Far from town and toil of living , To a holy day my spirit giving ,...</p>
   <p>Thou tender flower , I kneel beside thee Wondering why God so beautified thee .—</p>
   <p>An answering thought within me springeth , A bloom of the mind her vision bringeth .</p>
   <p>Between the dim hill 's distant azure And flowery foreground of sparkling pleasure</p>
   <p>I see the company of figures sainted , For whom the picture of earth was painted .</p>
   <p>Those robA " d seers who made man 's story The crown of Nature , Her cause his glory .</p>
   <p>They walk in the city which they have builded , The city of God from evil shielded :</p>
   <p>To them for canopy the vault of heaven , The flowery earth for carpet is given ;</p>
   <p>Whereon I wander not unknowing , With worship and joy my heart o'erflowing .</p>

   <p>" 21 . New Quarterly . Jan. 1909 , with an essay on the Virgilian Hexameter , &amp; c. These experiments in quantitive verse were made in fulfilment of a promise to William Johnson Stone that I would some day test his theory . His premature death converted my consent into a serious obligation . This personal explanation is due to myself for two reasons : because I might otherwise appear firstly as an advocate of the system , secondly as responsible for Stone 's determination of the lengths of English syllables . Before writing quantitive verse it is necessary to learn to think in quantities . This is no light task , and a beginner requires fixed rules . Except for a few minor details , which I had disputed with Mr. Stone , I was bound to take his rules as he had elaborated them ; and it was not until I had made some progress and could think fairly well in his prosody that I seriously criticized it . The two chief errors that I find in it are that he relied too much on the quality of a vowel in determining its syllabic length , and that he regarded the h as always consonantal in quality . His valuation of the er sound is doubtful , but defensible and convenient , and I have never discarded it . My earlier experiments contain therefore a good many ‘ false quantities ’ , and these , where they could not be very easily ( though inconsistently ) amended , I have left , and marked most of them in the text : a few false quantities do not make a poem less readable . Thus a long mark over a syllable means that Stone reckoned it as long , and that the verse requires it to be so pronounced , but that I regard it as short , or at least as doubtful . For example on p. 414 R [= u ] in is thus written . Of all accented long vowels in ‘ open ’ position the long u seems perhaps to retain its quantity best , but there is evidence that Tennyson held it to be shortened , and I do not know whether it might be an exception or go with th [) e ] ory , p [) i ] ety , p [) o ] etry , &amp; c. Again , where a final syllable should be lengthened or not shortened by position , but lacks its consonantal support , I have put a [ v ] in the gap : these weak places are chiefly due to my accepting Stone 's unchanging valuation of h. My emancipation from Stone 's rules was gradual , so that I have not been able to distinguish definitely my earlier experiments from the later , in which the quantities are such as I have now come to approve of : but my line-for-line paraphrase of Virgil is such a later experiment . It was accompanied in the New Quarterly by a long examination of the Virgilian hexameter , to which I would refer any one who is interested in the subject . In these English hexameters I have used and advocate the use of Miltonic elision . The mark [ ’ ] in the text shows where I have purposely allowed a short syllable to sustain a long place . Though the difficulty of adapting our English syllables to the Greek rules is very great , and even deterrent — for I cannot pretend to have attained to an absolutely consistent scheme — yet the experiments that I have made reveal a vast unexplored field of delicate and expressive rhythms hitherto unknown in our poetry : and this amply rewarded me for my friendly undertaking .</p>

     <l n="74">Fell by slumber opprest unheedfully into the wide sea :</l>
     <l n="75">Whom i ’ the gloom when hardly he knew , now changed in affliction , 340</l>

     <l n="90">Two nights and one day buffeted held I to the good spar</l>

     <l n="94">Had not there the wrecking savages , who spied-me defenceless ,</l>

     <l n="99">By thy Sire 's memories , thy hope of youthful Iulus ,</l>
     <l n="100">Rescue-me from these ills , brave master ; Go to Velija ,</l>

     <l n="422">‘ Ah , thou'rt come , thou'rt come ! at length thy dearly belov 'd grace</l>

     <l n="425">Nay , I look't for ‘ t thus , counting patiently the moments , 690</l>
     <l n="426">And ever expected ; nor did fond fancy betray me .</l>

     <l n="432">My fleet moors i ’ the blue Tyrrhene : all with-me goeth well .</l>
     <l n="433">Grant-me to touch thy hand as of old , and thy body embrace . ’</l>
     <l n="434">Speaking , awhile in tears his feeling mutinied , and when</l>
     <l n="435">For the longing contact of mortal affection , he out-held 700</l>
     <l n="436">His strong arms , the figure sustain 'd them not : ‘ twas as empty</l>
     <l n="437">E'en as a windworn cloud , or a phantom of irrelevant sleep .</l>
     <l n="438">On the level bosom of this vale more thickly the tall trees</l>
     <l n="439">Grow , an ’ aneath quivering poplars and whispering alders</l>
     <l n="440">Lethe 's dreamy river throu ’ peaceful scenery windeth .</l>
     <l n="441">Whereby now flitted in vast swarms many people of all lands ,</l>
     <l n="442">As when in early summer ‘ honey-bees on a flowery pasture</l>

     <l n="478">Each cometh unto his own retribution ,— if after in ample</l>
