    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">Most of the following poems have appeared in the ‘ S. Barnabas ’ Parish Magazine . ’ For my godchildren and my people I have made them up into a little bundle of sticks — a Christmas faggot to feed the fires in the winter palace of our King .</p>
    <p n="2">It is the Incarnation that justifies all joy , and song is the expression of joy . The Gospel Songs all celebrate the Great Nativity . Birth and marriage are the occasions most sacred to mirth and music among men ; and Christmas is at once the Birthday and the Marriage Festival of Humanity .</p>
    <p n="3">Glad and thankful shall I be if any song of mine should help to fan the flame of rejoicing love in any Christian heart at this holy and happy season .</p>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">The Royal Birthday dawns again ,</l>
     <l n="5">A stricken world to bless ;</l>
     <l n="6">And sufferers forget their pain ,</l>
     <l n="7">And mourners their distress .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">Love sings to-day ; her eyes so fair</l>
     <l n="9">With happy tears are wet ;</l>
     <l n="10">She is too humble to despair ,</l>
     <l n="11">Too faithful to forget .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="12">Her voice is very soft and sweet ,</l>
     <l n="13">Her heart is brave and strong ;</l>
     <l n="14">Her vassal , I would fain repeat</l>
     <l n="15">Some fragments of her song .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="16">A Birthday-song my heart would sing</l>
     <l n="17">Its rapture to express ;</l>
     <l n="18">My Father 's son must be a king ,</l>
     <l n="19">And share His consciousness .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="20">Of God 's Self-knowledge comes the Word</l>
     <l n="21">That utters all His Thought ;</l>
     <l n="22">That Word made Flesh by all is heard</l>
     <l n="23">Who seek as they are sought .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="24">His seeking and His finding make</l>
     <l n="25">Our search an easy thing ;</l>
     <l n="26">He sows good seed , and bids us take</l>
     <l n="27">The joys of harvesting .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="28">Yet must His children do their part ,</l>
     <l n="29">And what He gives accept ;</l>
     <l n="30">No heart can understand His Heart</l>
     <l n="31">That has not bled and wept .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="32">All seasons , bring they bale or bliss ,</l>
     <l n="33">His priceless treasures hold ;</l>
     <l n="34">The Winter 's silver all is His ,</l>
     <l n="35">And His the Summer 's gold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="36">Life 's harvest is not reaped until</l>
     <l n="37">The Christ within has grown</l>
     <l n="38">To perfect manhood , and self-will</l>
     <l n="39">By love is overthrown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="40">Such manhood gained concludes the strife</l>
     <l n="41">That makes the babe a boy ;</l>
     <l n="42">‘ T is thus the seed becomes a life ,</l>
     <l n="43">The life becomes a joy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="44">The eyes that weep are eyes that see ,</l>
     <l n="45">And swift are pilgrim-feet ;</l>
     <l n="46">Ah ! hope at length may come to be</l>
     <l n="47">Than memory more sweet .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="48">So keeping festival to-day ,</l>
     <l n="49">With children 's laughter near ,</l>
     <l n="50">It is not hard to sing and pray ,</l>
     <l n="51">‘ T is hard to doubt or fear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="52">Father , my heart to Thee I bring ,</l>
     <l n="53">To Thee my song address ;</l>
     <l n="54">From Winter pain and toil of Spring</l>
     <l n="55">Grows Summer happiness .</l>

     <l n="3">Behold , by Raphael shown , Love 's sacrament !</l>
     <l n="4">Earth 's curtains part , God 's veil is lifted up ;</l>
     <l n="5">There comes a Child , forth from His Bosom sent</l>
     <l n="6">To rule the feast of life , His Bread and Cup ,</l>
     <l n="7">His purpose making plain with man to sup .</l>
     <l n="8">Out-streams the light , accomplished is the Sign ,</l>
     <l n="9">A Virgin-Mother clasps a Babe Divine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">Her lovely feet descend the cloudy stair ,</l>
     <l n="11">Great succour bringing to a world forlorn ;</l>
     <l n="12">On either side a man and woman share</l>
     <l n="13">A common rapture , welcoming the dawn</l>
     <l n="14">Of God 's new day , the everlasting morn —</l>
     <l n="15">Of such a day as shall from East to West</l>
     <l n="16">Dispel the darkness , doing Love 's behest .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="17">He turns a face all radiant to the Sun ,</l>
     <l n="18">Enamoured of the sight he looks upon ;</l>
     <l n="19">She to the end of what is now begun</l>
     <l n="20">Downgazes , stooping , shadowed by the throne</l>
     <l n="21">Made by a Maiden 's arms , maternal grown ;</l>
     <l n="22">Than ivory most fair , than purest gold ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="24">On cherubs twain , whom watching has made wise ,</l>
     <l n="25">A spell has fallen — a prophetic dream ;</l>
     <l n="26">Their upward-gazing and far-seeing eyes ,</l>
     <l n="27">Like stars reflected in a tranquil stream ,</l>
     <l n="28">To look beyond the Child and Mother seem ;</l>
     <l n="29">A twisted thorn-branch and a cross to them</l>
     <l n="30">Are manifest — His throne and diadem .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">High heaven open stands , and there a crowd</l>
     <l n="32">Of worshippers with love-lit eyes appear ,</l>
     <l n="33">Like stars down-gazing through a fleecy cloud ,</l>
     <l n="34">Dimly discerned as morning draweth near</l>
     <l n="35">Spreading a radiant pall upon night 's bier .</l>
     <l n="36">The blessed thing the Sign doth signify</l>
     <l n="37">They partly know , and are made glad thereby .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="38">But more the Mother knows , and more she sees</l>
     <l n="39">Than soaring angel or than climbing saint ;</l>
     <l n="40">Her heart familiar grown with mysteries</l>
     <l n="41">Of God 's own working under love 's constraint ,</l>
     <l n="42">The remedy she knows for man 's complaint .</l>
     <l n="43">The clouds are all beneath her , and above</l>
     <l n="44">The light of life , the radiancy of love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="45">And He , Whom Lord of love and life we hail ,</l>
     <l n="46">Is on her bosom borne , a blossom fair ;</l>
     <l n="47">The pentecostal breath that lifts her veil</l>
     <l n="48">Has fanned His royal brow , and stirred His hair ,</l>
     <l n="49">And kissed His lips just parted for a prayer .</l>
     <l n="50">That spirit-wind shall blow , that Face shall shine ,</l>
     <l n="51">Till all His brothers know their Father 's Sign .</l>

    <head>NOTES .</head>
    <p n="1">NOTE A .</p>
    <p n="2">The Madonna di San Sisto .</p>
    <p n="3">Raffaelle 's world-famous picture of the Mother and her Divine Child in the Gallery at Dresden is in a measure known to almost all from prints and photographs . As to the colour of the picture , the significant beauty of which none who have not seen the original can conceive , it should be remembered that the parted curtains are green ( the earth-colour ) , and the Virgin Mother comes forth , as it were , from the white bosom of a stooping heaven , whose far distances , dimly seen , fade into a blue firmament peopled with angelic faces .</p>
    <p n="4">Many have felt this picture — at once so serene and so impassioned — to be a revelation . As we yield ourselves to its fascination and search further and further into its depths , we feel that Faber 's words justify themselves : ‘ Christian Art , rightly considered , is at once a theology and a worship ; a theology which has its own method of teaching , its own ways of representation , its own devout discoveries , its own varying opinions , all of which are beautiful so long as they are in subordination to the mind of the Church .... Art is a revelation from heaven , and a mighty power for God . It is a merciful disclosure to men of His more hidden beauty . It brings out things in God which lie too deep for words . ’ ( Bethlehem , p . 240 . )</p>
    <p n="5">It was a satisfaction to find my reading of this incomparable picture powerfully endorsed by one who , more perhaps than any living writer , has made good his claim to be regarded with the reverence that belongs to a scribe instructed in the things of the spiritual kingdom , bringing forth from his treasure things new and old . I quote the following passage from Canon Westcott 's weighty contribution to the discussion of a subject second to none in interest and importance — ‘ The Relation of Christianity to Art : ’ ‘ In the Madonna di San Sisto Raffaelle has rendered the idea of Divine motherhood and Divine Sonship in intelligible forms . No one can rest in the individual figures . The tremulous fulness of emotion in the face of the Mother , the intense , far-reaching gaze of the Child , constrain the beholder to look beyond . For him too the curtain is drawn aside ; he feels that there is a fellowship of earth with heaven and of heaven with earth , and understands the meaning of the attendant Saints who express the different aspects of this double communion . ’ ( Epistles of S. John , p . 358 . )</p>
    <p n="6">I will only add some beautiful words of Mrs. Jameson , which also I had not seen when my verses were written : ‘ I have seen my own ideal once , and only once , attained : there , where Raffaelle — inspired if ever painter was inspired — projected on the space before him that wonderful creation which we style the Madonna di San Sisto ; for there she stands — the transfigured woman — at once completely human and completely divine , an abstraction of power , purity , and love , poised on the empurpled air , and requiring no other support ; looking out with her melancholy , loving mouth , her slightly dilated , sibylline eyes , quite through the universe , to the end and consummation of all things ; sad , as if she beheld afar off the visionary sword that was to reach her heart through Him , now resting as enthroned on that heart ; yet already exalted through the homage of the redeemed generations who were to salute her as Blessed . ’ ( Legends of the Madonna : Introduction , p . 44 . )</p>
    <p n="7">NOTE B .</p>
    <p n="8">Bethlehem Gate .</p>
    <p n="9">I extract the following from some unpublished notes on the pictures by Rossetti exhibited at Burlington House two years ago : ‘ " Bethlehem Gate ” is the name of a lovely little pictured parable . On the left we see the massacre of innocents , representing the world , in whose cruel habitations the same outrage is ever being enacted , since all sin is in truth the sin of blood-guiltiness , bringing life into jeopardy . On the right the Heavenly Dove is seen leading forth God 's elect children , the Holy Family , the infant Church , to the land of righteousness . The Maiden-Mother , with the Divine Innocent enthroned on her bosom , attended and protected by a backward-looking and a forward-looking angel , and escorted by S. Joseph , passes the gate of the City of David . Egypt beneath her feet becomes the holy land .<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>Thus with all fitting ceremonial is the Church 's pilgrimage through the world , through the ages , inaugurated . ’</p>
    <p n="10">NOTE C .</p>
    <p n="11">The Daysman .</p>
    <p n="12">‘ The Word became Flesh and tabernacled among us ’ — that is the supreme and august Verity which dominates all the thoughts of the children of the Kingdom . Their eyes are fixed on the Life that the Scripture-record contains rather than on the record itself .</p>
    <p n="13">To them the oracles of God are indeed living , because they discern therein not certain words about Christ , but Christ the Word Himself ; reading them by the light of the great Tradition which lives and grows with the life and growth of the Spirit-bearing Church — the consciousness of the real Presence of Christ in her and in her Scriptures alike . It is in truth no unwritten Tradition , for it is inscribed in spiritual characters upon the fleshy tables of the heart by the Holy Ghost Himself , the Finger of God . To His pupils all things are Divine words variously embodied , and the Word made Flesh is the one all-comprehending Mystery , the eternal , all-revealing , and all-sufficing Sacrament . That Word is a Divine Person , Whose Manhood is a living , abiding , ever-energising Mediatorial Agency . That Word , eternally uttered by the Mouth of God , was in the Incarnation uttered ( so to speak ) in another language , and made audible and intelligible to man . By this language , common to God and man , the thought of God became man 's thought , and the thought of man God 's thought . In Him , the Mediating Word , they are at one ; He is the Atonement . And being the Word , He is the Prayer both of God and man , whose expression is the enduring evidence of that Atonement , the ceaseless occupation and satisfaction of those who in Him are atoned and united . ‘ A mediator is not a mediator of one , but God is one , ’ is S. Paul 's statement of the mystery ; and of this characteristic doctrine of Christianity the Psalmist had already caught a glimpse when , in the exercise of a prophetical gift , he speaks of Christ as Prayer .<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span></p>
    <p n="14">It is needless to add that the sanctuary of the Eucharist is the school in which this truth is most eloquently taught and effectually learnt .</p>
    <p n="15">NOTE D .</p>
    <p n="16">Three Sisters .</p>
    <p n="17">The following interpretation , which accompanied the poem on its first appearance , is retained for the sake of those who then welcomed it :—</p>
    <p n="18">Those who sing songs to children no less than they who tell them stories must be prepared for many questions , some of them difficult to answer . The two questions which recur most frequently are ( 1 ) ‘ Is it true ? ’ and ( 2 ) ‘ What does it mean ? ’</p>
    <p n="19">Questioned as to my little poem , I reply to the first question without hesitation ,— ‘ Yes , it is all true . ’ But the second question is more difficult to deal with . If , however , an answer is insisted on , something like this is what I must say :—</p>
    <p n="20">God 's story has no end ; it is more wonderful than anything wonderland can show ; lovelier than the loveliest thing said or sung of fairyland . The Gospel and the Creed are a part of that story ; and with this our little poem is concerned . It speaks of God 's garden — paradise regained — a renewed earth , wherein a trinity in unity , observable in all things , testifies of Him , a shadow cast from above .</p>
    <p n="21">Shall we take the verses in order ?</p>
    <p n="22">Verse 1 . Three fountains ( which issue forth from beneath one altar-throne ) feed one river ( which , strange to say , seen from below , is four-fold ) , and by this river the whole earth , God 's garden , is encircled and fertilised . That garden contains the tree of life , wherein three doves have one nest .</p>
    <p n="23">Verse 2 . But the fuller revelation comes out of human nature itself , when taken into fellowship with God . The elect lady , representative of humanity , is from one point of view , looking at fundamental relations , daughter , spouse , mother ; from another , looking at essential characteristics , faith , hope , and love . The place of meeting , that is dawning consciousness , is the fairyland of phenomenal existence .</p>
    <p n="24">Verse 3 . Out of this fairyland humanity is led forward and upward by the path of sacrifice , until the summit of the cross-crowned mountain of life is gained ; and all heads are aureoled by a light which , like that of the Transfiguration , dawns and deepens from within . This cannot be till we have ceased to be self-centred , and have become Christ-centred .</p>
    <p n="25">Verse 4 . All growth is very secret and mysterious , part of the mystery of life . The development of humanity follows the order indicated in the narrative of creation ; light must come before vegetation , sunshine before flowers . In the garden of the Incarnation all is recovered ; the wilderness blossoms as a rose , and the poor bush of the desert becomes a garden-tree , a plant of renown , unconsumed because permanently enkindled with the fire of a divine life .</p>
    <p n="26">Verse 5 . Every flower is a little sun , and shines forth , owing its beauty to an effort after conformity to the likeness of its cherisher , not without the succour of gracious dews . Its sunshine ministers to hope . And by faith the old-world homage rendered to wisdom ( with which it is really one ) is justified and transfigured . And love , being one with purity , looks at us out of the sweet white face of the lily .</p>
    <p n="27">Verse 6 . All men , like these sister-graces , must join hands and hearts . Thus shall be woven a threefold cord , divinely strong and unbreakable ; and the testimony , reiterated by the still small voice of a Divine Whisperer , shall be accepted by all , because realised in all : ‘ Love makes a unity of three ; ’ and ‘ God is love . ’</p>
    <p n="28">‘ Is that what the poem means ? ’ I think I hear my questioner ask . ‘ Yes , that is a little of what it means — only a little . ’</p>

    <p n="30">Four Epiphanies .</p>
    <p n="31">Nothing perhaps more clearly demonstrates the Divine instinct that resides in the Church than the construction of her Calendar and the arrangement of her year . Like the Creed , whose truths it teaches and enforces , it grew up gradually as the outcome and embodiment of her devotional life . The Epiphany , or Feast of Manifestation , was one of the first observed of her days of solemn commemoration ; and the day came to be prolonged into a season embracing six Sundays . She would have her children understand that in all that He did and said our Lord was manifesting forth His glory , and justifying His great announcement — ‘ I am the Light of the world . ’</p>
    <p n="32">The Four Epiphanies to which the poem refers belong to the Scriptures appointed for the Day itself and the two following Sundays . The first was made to the Wise Men of the East , representing the inspired wisdom of the Gentile world ; the second to the Doctors of the Temple , representing the Bible-taught wisdom of the Jews ; the third to the Forerunner , the last and greatest of the Prophet-heralds of the Incarnation ; the fourth to the Bridegroom and Bride and the wedding guests at Cana of Galilee , representing Humanity , of which the family is the appointed and abiding type .</p>
    <p n="33">The Catholic Church by her methods , no less than by her Sacraments , her Scriptures , and her Creeds , is ever maintaining her protest against the limitations by which all merely human systems are disfigured . She is ever bearing her impassioned witness to Him Who is ‘ the Light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world . ’ This is the real significance of the solemnities that accompany her Epiphany observance .</p>
    <p n="34">NOTE F .</p>
    <p n="35">The Gospel Songs .</p>
    <p n="36">The Tree of Life is the real Christmas Tree . Its underwoven roots support the cradle ; its branches , overarching with many a blossom and many a cluster , form the canopy of the Heavenly Babe , the Darling of God and of man . ‘ The fruit thereof is for meat , the leaf thereof for medicine ; ’ mindful of which the holy Evangelists speak of the crib as a ‘ manger , ’ that is the feeding place . ‘ Lo ! we heard of the same at ( Bethlehem ) Ephrata , and found it in the Wood . ’</p>
    <p n="37">The Gospel songs express the joy with which by the humble and simple and pure-hearted this Plant of Renown is discovered ; this House of Bread visited . They come from the lips of a maiden who is a mother , of an ancient who is a child , of a priest who is a prophet . When such fountains of song are unsealed , the music belongs rather to heaven than to earth .</p>
