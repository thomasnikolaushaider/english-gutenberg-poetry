Aesch . Cho . 602-612 THE ARGUMENT . Althaea , daughter of Thestius and Eurythemis , queen of Calydon , being with child of Meleager her first-born son , dreamed that she brought forth a brand burning ; and upon his birth came the three Fates and prophesied of him three things , namely these ; that he should have great strength of his hands , and good fortune in this life , and that he should live no longer when the brand then in the fire were consumed : wherefore his mother plucked it forth and kept it by her . And the child being a man grown sailed with Jason after the fleece of gold , and won himself great praise of all men living ; and when the tribes of the north and west made war upon Aetolia , he fought against their army and scattered it . But Artemis , having at the first stirred up these tribes to war against Oeneus king of Calydon , because he had offered sacrifice to all the gods saving her alone , but her he had forgotten to honour , was yet more wroth because of the destruction of this army , and sent upon the land of Calydon a wild boar which slew many and wasted all their increase , but him could none slay , and many went against him and perished . Then were all the chief men of Greece gathered together , and among them Atalanta daughter of Iasius the Arcadian , a virgin , for whose sake Artemis let slay the boar , seeing she favoured the maiden greatly ; and Meleager having despatched it gave the spoil thereof to Atalanta , as one beyond measure enamoured of her ; but the brethren of Althaea his mother , Toxeus and Plexippus , with such others as misliked that she only should bear off the praise whereas many had borne the labour , laid wait for her to take away her spoil ; but Meleager fought against them and slew them : whom when Althaea their sister beheld and knew to be slain of her son , she waxed for wrath and sorrow like as one mad , and taking the brand whereby the measure of her son 's life was meted to him , she cast it upon a fire ; and with the wasting thereof his life likewise wasted away , that being brought back to his father 's house he died in a brief space , and his mother also endured not long after for very sorrow ; and this was his end , and the end of that hunting .

     <l n="1">Maiden , and mistress of the months and stars</l>
     <l n="2">Now folded in the flowerless fields of heaven ,</l>
     <l n="3">Goddess whom all gods love with threefold heart ,</l>
     <l n="4">Being treble in thy divided deity ,</l>
     <l n="5">A light for dead men and dark hours , a foot</l>
     <l n="6">Swift on the hills as morning , and a hand</l>
     <l n="7">To all things fierce and fleet that roar and range</l>
     <l n="8">Mortal , with gentler shafts than snow or sleep ;</l>
     <l n="9">Hear now and help and lift no violent hand ,</l>
     <l n="10">But favourable and fair as thine eye 's beam</l>
     <l n="11">Hidden and shown in heaven , for I all night</l>
     <l n="12">Amid the king 's hounds and the hunting men</l>
     <l n="13">Have wrought and worshipped toward thee ; nor shall man</l>
     <l n="14">See goodlier hounds or deadlier edge of spears ,</l>
     <l n="15">But for the end , that lies unreached at yet</l>
     <l n="16">Between the hands and on the knees of gods ,</l>
     <l n="17">O fair-faced sun killing the stars and dews</l>
     <l n="18">And dreams and desolation of the night !</l>
     <l n="19">Rise up , shine , stretch thine hand out , with thy bow</l>
     <l n="20">Touch the most dimmest height of trembling heaven ,</l>
     <l n="21">And burn and break the dark about thy ways ,</l>
     <l n="22">Shot through and through with arrows ; let thine hair</l>
     <l n="23">Lighten as flame above that nameless shell</l>
     <l n="24">Which was the moon , and thine eyes fill the world</l>
     <l n="25">And thy lips kindle with swift beams ; let earth</l>
     <l n="26">Laugh , and the long sea fiery from thy feet</l>
     <l n="27">Through all the roar and ripple of streaming springs</l>
     <l n="28">And foam in reddening flakes and flying flowers</l>
     <l n="29">Shaken from hands and blown from lips of nymphs</l>
     <l n="30">Whose hair or breast divides the wandering wave</l>
     <l n="31">With salt close tresses cleaving lock to lock ,</l>
     <l n="32">All gold , or shuddering and unfurrowed snow ;</l>
     <l n="33">And all the winds about thee with their wings ,</l>
     <l n="34">And fountain-heads of all the watered world ;</l>
     <l n="35">Each horn of Acheloüs , and the green</l>
     <l n="36">Euenus , wedded with the straitening sea .</l>
     <l n="37">For in fair time thou comest ; come also thou ,</l>
     <l n="38">Twin-born with him , and virgin , Artemis ,</l>
     <l n="39">And give our spears their spoil , the wild boar 's hide .</l>
     <l n="40">Sent in thine anger against us for sin done</l>
     <l n="41">And bloodless altars without wine or fire .</l>
     <l n="42">Him now consume thou ; for thy sacrifice</l>
     <l n="43">With sanguine-shining steam divides the dawn ,</l>
     <l n="44">And one , the maiden rose of all thy maids ,</l>
     <l n="45">Arcadian Atalanta , snowy-souled ,</l>
     <l n="46">Fair as the snow and footed as the wind ,</l>
     <l n="47">From Ladon and well-wooded Maenalus</l>
     <l n="48">Over the firm hills and the fleeting sea</l>
     <l n="49">Hast thou drawn hither , and many an armèd king ,</l>
     <l n="50">Heroes , the crown of men , like gods in fight .</l>
     <l n="51">Moreover out of all the Aetolian land ,</l>
     <l n="52">From the full-flowered Lelantian pasturage</l>
     <l n="53">To what of fruitful field the son of Zeus</l>
     <l n="54">Won from the roaring river and labouring sea</l>
     <l n="55">When the wild god shrank in his horn and fled</l>
     <l n="56">And foamed and lessened through his wrathful fords ,</l>
     <l n="57">Leaving clear lands that steamed with sudden sun ,</l>
     <l n="58">These virgins with the lightening of the day</l>
     <l n="59">Bring thee fresh wreaths and their own sweeter hair ,</l>
     <l n="60">Luxurious locks and flower-like mixed with flowers ,</l>
     <l n="61">Clean offering , and chaste hymns ; but me the time</l>
     <l n="62">Divides from these things ; whom do thou not less</l>
     <l n="63">Help and give honour , and to mine hounds good speed ,</l>
     <l n="64">And edge to spears , and luck to each man 's hand .</l>

     <l n="4">With lisp of leaves and ripple of rain ;</l>

     <l n="6">Is half assuaged for Itylus ,</l>

     <l n="20">Fire , or the strength of the streams that spring !</l>
     <l n="21">For the stars and the winds are unto her</l>

     <l n="33">I dreamed that out of this my womb had sprung</l>
     <l n="34">Fire and a firebrand ; this was ere my son ,</l>
     <l n="35">Meleager , a goodly flower in fields of fight ,</l>
     <l n="36">Felt the light touch him coming forth , and waited</l>
     <l n="37">Childlike ; but yet he was not ; and in time</l>
     <l n="38">I bare him , and my heart was great ; for yet</l>
     <l n="39">So royally was never strong man born ,</l>
     <l n="40">Nor queen so nobly bore as noble a thing</l>
     <l n="41">As this my son was : such a birth God sent</l>
     <l n="42">And such a grace to bear it . Then came in</l>
     <l n="43">Three weaving women , and span each a thread ,</l>
     <l n="44">Saying This for strength and That for luck , and one</l>
     <l n="45">Saying Till the brand upon the hearth burn down ,</l>
     <l n="46">So long shall this man see good days and live .</l>
     <l n="47">And I with gathered raiment from the bed</l>
     <l n="48">Sprang , and drew forth the brand , and cast on it</l>
     <l n="49">Water , and trod the flame bare-foot , and crushed</l>
     <l n="50">With naked hand spark beaten out of spark</l>
     <l n="51">And blew against and quenched it ; for I said ,</l>
     <l n="52">These are the most high Fates that dwell with us ,</l>
     <l n="53">And we find favour a little in their sight ,</l>
     <l n="54">A little , and more we miss of , and much time</l>
     <l n="55">Foils us ; howbeit they have pitied me , O son ,</l>
     <l n="56">And thee most piteous , thee a tenderer thing</l>
     <l n="57">Than any flower of fleshly seed alive .</l>
     <l n="58">Wherefore I kissed and hid him with my hands ,</l>
     <l n="59">And covered under arms and hair , and wept ,</l>
     <l n="60">And feared to touch him with my tears , and laughed ;</l>
     <l n="61">So light a thing was this man , grown so great</l>
     <l n="62">Men cast their heads back , seeing against the sun</l>
     <l n="63">Blaze the armed man carven on his shield , and hear</l>
     <l n="64">The laughter of little bells along the brace</l>
     <l n="65">Ring , as birds singing or flutes blown , and watch ,</l>
     <l n="66">High up , the cloven shadow of either plume</l>
     <l n="67">Divide the bright light of the brass , and make</l>
     <l n="68">His helmet as a windy and wintering moon</l>
     <l n="69">Seen through blown cloud and plume-like drift , when ships</l>
     <l n="70">Drive , and men strive with all the sea , and oars</l>
     <l n="71">Break , and the beaks dip under , drinking death ;</l>
     <l n="72">Yet was he then but a span long , and moaned</l>
     <l n="73">With inarticulate mouth inseparate words ,</l>
     <l n="74">And with blind lips and fingers wrung my breast</l>
     <l n="75">Hard , and thrust out with foolish hands and feet ,</l>
     <l n="76">Murmuring ; but those grey women with bound hair</l>
     <l n="77">Who fright the gods frighted not him ; he laughed</l>
     <l n="78">Seeing them , and pushed out hands to feel and haul</l>
     <l n="79">Distaff and thread , intangible ; but they</l>
     <l n="80">Passed , and I hid the brand , and in my heart</l>
     <l n="81">Laughed likewise , having all my will of heaven .</l>
     <l n="82">But now I know not if to left or right</l>
     <l n="83">The gods have drawn us hither ; for again</l>
     <l n="84">I dreamt , and saw the black brand burst on fire</l>
     <l n="85">As a branch bursts in flower , and saw the flame</l>
     <l n="86">Fade flower-wise , and Death came and with dry lips</l>
     <l n="87">Blew the charred ash into my breast ; and Love</l>
     <l n="88">Trampled the ember and crushed it with swift feet</l>
     <l n="89">This I have also at heart ; that not for me ,</l>
     <l n="90">Not for me only or son of mine , O girls ,</l>
     <l n="91">The gods have wrought life , and desire of life ,</l>
     <l n="92">Heart 's love and heart 's division ; but for all</l>
     <l n="93">There shines one sun and one wind blows till night .</l>
     <l n="94">And when night comes the wind sinks and the sun ,</l>
     <l n="95">And there is no light after , and no storm ,</l>
     <l n="96">But sleep and much forgetfulness of things .</l>
     <l n="97">In such wise I gat knowledge of the gods</l>
     <l n="98">Years hence , and heard high sayings of one most wise ,</l>
     <l n="99">Eurythemis my mother , who beheld</l>
     <l n="100">With eyes alive and spake with lips of these</l>
     <l n="101">As one on earth disfleshed and disallied</l>
     <l n="102">From breath or blood corruptible ; such gifts</l>
     <l n="103">Time gave her , and an equal soul to these</l>
     <l n="104">And equal face to all things , thus she said .</l>
     <l n="105">But whatsoever intolerable or glad</l>
     <l n="106">The swift hours weave and unweave , I go hence</l>
     <l n="107">Full of mine own soul , perfect of myself ,</l>
     <l n="108">Toward mine and me sufficient ; and what chance</l>
     <l n="109">The gods cast lots for and shake out on us ,</l>
     <l n="110">That shall we take , and that much bear withal .</l>
     <l n="111">And now , before these gather to the hunt ,</l>
     <l n="112">I will go arm my son and bring him forth ,</l>
     <l n="113">Lest love or some man 's anger work him harm .</l>

     <l n="83">Thankworthy , a praise for ever ; and hast won fame</l>
     <l n="84">When wild wars broke all round thy father 's house ,</l>

     <l n="86">Laid spears against us like a sea , and all</l>

     <l n="91">And man from man they fell ; for ye twain stood</l>
     <l n="92">God against god , Ares and Artemis ,</l>
     <l n="93">And thou the mightier ; wherefore she unleashed</l>
     <l n="94">A sharp-toothed curse thou too shalt overcome ;</l>

     <l n="96">Ere the full blade caught flower , and when time gave</l>
     <l n="97">Respite , thou didst not slacken soul nor sleep ,</l>
     <l n="98">But with great hand and heart seek praise of men</l>
     <l n="99">Out of sharp straits and many a grievous thing ,</l>
     <l n="100">Seeing the strange foam of undivided seas</l>
     <l n="101">On channels never sailed in , and by shores</l>
     <l n="102">Where the old winds cease not blowing , and all the night</l>

     <l n="152">That these things are not otherwise , but thus ;</l>

     <l n="155">All we are against thee , against thee , O God most high ,</l>
     <l n="156">But ye , keep ye on earth</l>
     <l n="157">Your lips from over-speech ,</l>
     <l n="158">Loud words and longing are so little worth ;</l>
     <l n="159">And the end is hard to reach .</l>
     <l n="160">For silence after grievous things is good ,</l>
     <l n="161">And reverence , and the fear that makes men whole ,</l>
     <l n="162">And shame , and righteous governance of blood ,</l>
     <l n="163">And lordship of the soul .</l>
     <l n="164">But from sharp words and wits men pluck no fruit ,</l>
     <l n="165">And gathering thorns they shake the tree at root ;</l>
     <l n="166">For words divide and rend ;</l>

     <l n="74">And falling , and weighed back by clamorous arms ,</l>
     <l n="75">Sharp rang the dead limbs of Eurytion .</l>
     <l n="76">Then one shot happier ; the Cadmean seer ,</l>
     <l n="77">Amphiaraus ; for his sacred shaft</l>
     <l n="78">Pierced the red circlet of one ravening eye</l>
     <l n="79">Beneath the brute brows of the sanguine boar ,</l>
     <l n="80">Now bloodier from one slain ; but he so galled</l>
     <l n="81">Sprang straight , and rearing cried no lesser cry</l>
     <l n="82">Than thunder and the roar of wintering streams</l>
     <l n="83">That mix their own foam with the yellower sea ;</l>
     <l n="84">And as a tower that falls by fire in fight</l>
     <l n="85">With ruin of walls and all its archery ,</l>
     <l n="86">And breaks the iron flower of war beneath ,</l>
     <l n="87">Crushing charred limbs and molten arms of men ;</l>
     <l n="88">So through crushed branches and the reddening brake</l>
     <l n="89">Clamoured and crashed the fervour of his feet ,</l>
     <l n="90">And trampled , springing sideways from the tusk ,</l>
     <l n="91">Too tardy a moving mould of heavy strength ,</l>
     <l n="92">Ancaeus ; and as flakes of weak-winged snow</l>
     <l n="93">Break , all the hard thews of his heaving limbs</l>
     <l n="94">Broke , and rent flesh fell every way , and blood</l>
     <l n="95">Flew , and fierce fragments of no more a man .</l>
     <l n="96">Then all the heroes drew sharp breath , and gazed ,</l>
     <l n="97">And smote not ; but Meleager , but thy son ,</l>
     <l n="98">Right in the wild way of the coming curse</l>
     <l n="99">Rock-rooted , fair with fierce and fastened lips ,</l>
     <l n="100">Clear eyes , and springing muscle and shortening limb —</l>
     <l n="101">With chin aslant indrawn to a tightening throat ,</l>
     <l n="102">Grave , and with gathered sinews , like a god ,—</l>
     <l n="103">Aimed on the left side his well-handled spear</l>
     <l n="104">Grasped where the ash was knottiest hewn , and smote ,</l>
     <l n="105">And with no missile wound , the monstrous boar</l>
     <l n="106">Right in the hairiest hollow of his hide</l>
     <l n="107">Under the last rib , sheer through bulk and bone ,</l>
     <l n="108">Peep in ; and deeply smitten , and to death ,</l>
     <l n="109">The heavy horror with his hanging shafts</l>
     <l n="110">Leapt , and fell furiously , and from raging lips</l>
     <l n="111">Foamed out the latest wrath of all his life .</l>
     <l n="112">And all they praised the gods with mightier heart ,</l>
     <l n="113">Zeus and all gods , but chiefliest Artemis ,</l>
     <l n="114">Seeing ; but Meleager bade whet knives and flay ,</l>
     <l n="115">Strip and stretch out the splendour of the spoil ;</l>
     <l n="116">And hot and horrid from the work all these</l>
     <l n="117">Sat , and drew breath and drank and made great cheer</l>
     <l n="118">And washed the hard sweat off their calmer brows .</l>
     <l n="119">For much sweet grass grew higher than grew the reed ,</l>
     <l n="120">And good for slumber , and every holier herb ,</l>
     <l n="121">Narcissus , and the low-lying melilote ,</l>
     <l n="122">And all of goodliest blade and bloom that springs</l>
     <l n="123">Where , hid by heavier hyacinth , violet buds</l>
     <l n="124">Blossom and burn ; and fire of yellower flowers</l>
     <l n="125">And light of crescent lilies , and such leaves</l>
     <l n="126">As fear the Faun 's and know the Dryad 's foot ;</l>
     <l n="127">Olive and ivy and poplar dedicate ,</l>
     <l n="128">And many a well-spring overwatched of these .</l>
     <l n="129">There now they rest ; but me the king bade bear</l>
