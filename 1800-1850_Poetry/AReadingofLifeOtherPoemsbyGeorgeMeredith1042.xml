      <l n="16">Through the water-eye of night ,</l>
      <l n="17">Midway between eve and dawn ,</l>
      <l n="18">See the chase , the rout , the flight</l>
      <l n="19">In deep forest ; oread , faun ,</l>
      <l n="20">Goat-foot , antlers laid on neck ;</l>
      <l n="21">Ravenous all the line for speed .</l>
      <l n="22">See yon wavy sparkle beck</l>
      <l n="23">Sign of the Virgin Lady 's lead .</l>
      <l n="24">Down her course a serpent star</l>
      <l n="25">Coils and shatters at her heels ;</l>
      <l n="26">Peals the horn exulting , peals</l>
      <l n="27">Plaintive , is it near or far .</l>
      <l n="28">Huntress , arrowy to pursue ,</l>
      <l n="29">In and out of woody glen ,</l>
      <l n="30">Under cliffs that tear the blue ,</l>
      <l n="31">Over torrent , over fen ,</l>
      <l n="32">She and forest , where she skims</l>
      <l n="33">Feathery , darken and relume :</l>
      <l n="34">Those are her white-lightning limbs</l>
      <l n="35">Cleaving loads of leafy gloom .</l>
      <l n="36">Mountains hear her and call back ,</l>
      <l n="37">Shrewd with night : a frosty wail</l>
      <l n="38">Distant : her the emerald vale</l>
      <l n="39">Folds , and wonders in her track .</l>
      <l n="40">Now her retinue is lean ,</l>
      <l n="41">Many rearward ; streams the chase</l>
      <l n="42">Eager forth of covert ; seen</l>
      <l n="43">One hot tide the rapturous race .</l>
      <l n="44">Quiver-charged and crescent-crowned ,</l>
      <l n="45">Up on a flash the lighted mound</l>
      <l n="46">Leaps she , bow to shoulder , shaft</l>
      <l n="47">Strung to barb with archer 's craft ,</l>
      <l n="48">Legs like plaited lyre-chords , feet</l>
      <l n="49">Songs to see , past pitch of sweet .</l>
      <l n="50">Fearful swiftness they outrun ,</l>
      <l n="51">Shaggy wildness , grey or dun ,</l>
      <l n="52">Challenge , charge of tusks elude :</l>
      <l n="53">Theirs the dance to tame the rude ;</l>
      <l n="54">Beast , and beast in manhood tame ,</l>
      <l n="55">Follow we their silver flame .</l>
      <l n="56">Pride of flesh from bondage free ,</l>
      <l n="57">Reaping vigour of its waste ,</l>
      <l n="58">Marks her servitors , and she</l>
      <l n="59">Sanctifies the unembraced .</l>
      <l n="60">Nought of perilous she reeks ;</l>
      <l n="61">Valour clothes her open breast ;</l>
      <l n="62">Sweet beyond the thrill of sex ;</l>
      <l n="63">Hallowed by the sex confessed .</l>
      <l n="64">Huntress arrowy to pursue ,</l>
      <l n="65">Colder she than sunless dew ,</l>
      <l n="66">She , that breath of upper air ;</l>
      <l n="67">Ay , but never lyrist sang ,</l>
      <l n="68">Draught of Bacchus never sprang</l>
      <l n="69">Blood the bliss of Gods to share ,</l>
      <l n="70">High o'er sweep of eagle wings ,</l>
      <l n="71">Like the run with her , when rings</l>
      <l n="72">Clear her rally , and her dart ,</l>
      <l n="73">In the forest 's cavern heart ,</l>
      <l n="74">Tells of her victorious aim .</l>
      <l n="75">Then is pause and chatter , cheer ,</l>
      <l n="76">Laughter at some satyr lame ,</l>
      <l n="77">Looks upon the fallen deer ,</l>
      <l n="78">Measuring his noble crest ;</l>
      <l n="79">Here a favourite in her train ,</l>
      <l n="80">Foremost mid her nymphs , caressed ;</l>
      <l n="81">All applauded . Shall she reign</l>
      <l n="82">Worshipped ? O to be with her there !</l>
      <l n="83">She , that breath of nimble air ,</l>
      <l n="84">Lifts the breast to giant power .</l>
      <l n="85">Maid and man , and man and maid ,</l>
      <l n="86">Who each other would devour</l>
      <l n="87">Elsewhere , by the chase betrayed ,</l>
      <l n="88">There are comrades , led by her ,</l>
      <l n="89">Maid-preserver , man-maker .</l>

      <l n="91">Who murmurs , hither , hither : who</l>
      <l n="92">Where nought is audible so fills the ear ?</l>
      <l n="93">Where nought is visible can make appear</l>
      <l n="94">A veil with eyes that waver through ,</l>
      <l n="95">Like twilight 's pledge of blessed night to come ,</l>
      <l n="96">Or day most golden ? All unseen and dumb ,</l>
      <l n="97">She breathes , she moves , inviting flees ,</l>
      <l n="98">Is lost , and leaves the thrilled desire</l>
      <l n="99">To clasp and strike a slackened lyre ,</l>
      <l n="100">Till over smiles of hyacinth seas ,</l>
      <l n="101">Flame in a crystal vessel sails</l>
      <l n="102">Beneath a dome of jewelled spray ,</l>
      <l n="103">For land that drops the rosy day</l>
      <l n="104">On nights of throbbing nightingales .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="7">
      <l n="105">Landward did the wonder flit ,</l>
      <l n="106">Or heart 's desire of her , all earth in it .</l>
      <l n="107">We saw the heavens fling down their rose ;</l>
      <l n="108">On rapturous waves we saw her glide ;</l>
      <l n="109">The pearly sea-shell half enclose ;</l>
      <l n="110">The shoal of sea-nymphs flush the tide ;</l>
      <l n="111">And we , afire to kiss her feet , no more</l>
      <l n="112">Behold than tracks along a startled shore ,</l>
      <l n="113">With brightened edges of dark leaves that feign</l>
      <l n="114">An ambush hoped , as heartless night remain .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="8">
      <l n="115">More closely , warmly : hither , hither ! she ,</l>
      <l n="116">The very she called forth by ripened blood</l>
      <l n="117">For its next breath of being , murmurs ; she ,</l>
      <l n="118">Allurement ; she , fulfilment ; she ,</l>
      <l n="119">The stream within us urged to flood ;</l>
      <l n="120">Man 's cry , earth 's answer , heaven 's consent ; O she ,</l>
      <l n="121">Maid , woman and divinity ;</l>
      <l n="122">Our over-earthly , inner-earthly mate</l>
      <l n="123">Unmated ; she , our hunger and our fruit</l>
      <l n="124">Untasted ; she our written fate</l>
      <l n="125">Unread ; Life 's flowering , Life 's root :</l>
      <l n="126">Unread , divined ; unseen , beheld ;</l>
      <l n="127">The evanescent , ever-present she ,</l>
      <l n="128">Great Nature 's stern necessity</l>
      <l n="129">In radiance clothed , to softness quelled ;</l>
      <l n="130">With a sword 's edge of sweetness keen to take</l>
      <l n="131">Our breath for bliss , our hearts for fulness break .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="9">
      <l n="132">The murmur hushes down , the veil is rent .</l>
      <l n="133">Man 's cry , earth 's answer , heaven 's consent ,</l>
      <l n="134">Her form is given to pardoned sight ,</l>
      <l n="135">And lets our mortal eyes receive</l>
      <l n="136">The sovereign loveliness of celestial white ;</l>
      <l n="137">Adored by them who solitarily pace ,</l>
      <l n="138">In dusk of the underworld 's perpetual eve ,</l>
      <l n="139">The paths among the meadow asphodel ,</l>
      <l n="140">Remembering . Never there her face</l>
      <l n="141">Is planetary ; reddens to shore sea-shell</l>
      <l n="142">Around such whiteness the enamoured air</l>
      <l n="143">Of noon that clothes her , never there .</l>
      <l n="144">Daughter of light , the joyful light ,</l>
      <l n="145">She stands unveiled to nuptial sight ,</l>
      <l n="146">Sweet in her disregard of aid</l>
      <l n="147">Divine to conquer or persuade .</l>
      <l n="148">A fountain jets from moss ; a flower</l>
      <l n="149">Bends gently where her sunset tresses shower .</l>
      <l n="150">By guerdon of her brilliance may be seen</l>
      <l n="151">With eyelids unabashed the passion 's Queen .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="10">
      <l n="152">Shorn of attendant Graces she can use</l>
      <l n="153">Her natural snares to make her will supreme .</l>
      <l n="154">A simple nymph it is , inclined to muse</l>
      <l n="155">Before the leader foot shall dip in stream :</l>
      <l n="156">One arm at curve along a rounded thigh ;</l>
      <l n="157">Her firm new breasts each pointing its own way</l>
      <l n="158">A knee half bent to shade its fellow shy ,</l>
      <l n="159">Where innocence , not nature , signals nay .</l>
      <l n="160">The bud of fresh virginity awaits</l>
      <l n="161">The wooer , and all roseate will she burst :</l>
      <l n="162">She touches on the hour of happy mates ;</l>
      <l n="163">Still is she unaware she wakens thirst .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="11">
      <l n="164">And while commanding blissful sight believe</l>
      <l n="165">It holds her as a body strained to breast ,</l>
      <l n="166">Down on the underworld 's perpetual eve</l>
      <l n="167">She plunges the possessor dispossessed ;</l>
      <l n="168">And bids believe that image , heaving warm ,</l>
      <l n="169">Is lost to float like torch-smoke after flame ;</l>
      <l n="170">The phantom any breeze blows out of form ;</l>
      <l n="171">A thirst 's delusion , a defeated aim .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="12">
      <l n="172">The rapture shed the torture weaves ;</l>
      <l n="173">The direst blow on human heart she deals :</l>
      <l n="174">The pain to know the seen deceives ;</l>
      <l n="175">Nought true but what insufferably feels .</l>
      <l n="176">And stabs of her delicious note ,</l>
      <l n="177">That is as heavenly light to hearing , heard</l>
      <l n="178">Through shelter leaves , the laughter from her throat ,</l>
      <l n="179">We answer as the midnight 's morning 's bird .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="13">
      <l n="180">She laughs , she wakens gleeful cries ;</l>
      <l n="181">In her delicious laughter part revealed ;</l>
      <l n="182">Yet mother is she more of moans and sighs ,</l>
      <l n="183">For longings unappeased and wounds unhealed .</l>
      <l n="184">Yet would she bless , it is her task to bless :</l>
      <l n="185">Yon folded couples , passing under shade ,</l>
      <l n="186">Are her rich harvest ; bidden caress , caress ,</l>
      <l n="187">Consume the fruit in bloom ; not disobeyed .</l>
      <l n="188">We dolorous complainers had a dream ,</l>
      <l n="189">Wrought on the vacant air from inner fire ,</l>
      <l n="190">We saw stand bare of her celestial beam</l>
      <l n="191">The glorious Goddess , and we dared desire .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="14">
      <l n="192">Thereat are shown reproachful eyes , and lips</l>
      <l n="193">Of upward curl to meanings half obscure ;</l>
      <l n="194">And glancing where a wood-nymph lightly skips</l>
      <l n="195">She nods : at once that creature wears her lure .</l>
      <l n="196">Blush of our being between birth and death :</l>
      <l n="197">Sob of our ripened blood for its next breath :</l>
      <l n="198">Her wily semblance nought of her denies ;</l>
      <l n="199">Seems it the Goddess runs , the Goddess hies ,</l>
      <l n="200">The generous Goddess yields . And she can arm</l>
      <l n="201">Her dwarfed and twisted with her secret charm ;</l>
      <l n="202">Benevolent as Earth to feed her own .</l>
      <l n="203">Fully shall they be fed , if they beseech .</l>
      <l n="204">But scorn she has for them that walk alone ;</l>
      <l n="205">Blanched men , starved women , whom no arts can pleach .</l>
      <l n="206">The men as chief of criminals she disdains ,</l>
      <l n="207">And holds the reason in perceptive thought .</l>
      <l n="208">More pitiable , like rivers lacking rains ,</l>
      <l n="209">Kissing cold stones , the women shrink for drought .</l>
      <l n="210">Those faceless discords , out of nature strayed ,</l>
      <l n="211">Rank of the putrefaction ere decayed ,</l>
      <l n="212">In impious singles bear the thorny wreaths :</l>
      <l n="213">Their lives are where harmonious Pleasure breathes</l>
      <l n="214">For couples crowned with flowers that burn in dew .</l>
      <l n="215">Comes there a tremor of night 's forest horn</l>
      <l n="216">Across her garden from the insaner crew ,</l>
      <l n="217">She darkens to malignity of scorn .</l>
      <l n="218">A shiver courses through her garden-grounds :</l>
      <l n="219">Grunt of the tusky boar , the baying hounds ,</l>
      <l n="220">The hunter 's shouts , are heard afar , and bring</l>
      <l n="221">Dead on her heart her crimsoned flower of Spring .</l>
      <l n="222">These , the irreverent of Life 's design ,</l>
      <l n="223">Division between natural and divine</l>
      <l n="224">Would cast ; these vaunting barrenness for best ,</l>
      <l n="225">In veins of gathered strength Life 's tide arrest ;</l>
      <l n="226">And these because the roses flood their cheeks ,</l>
      <l n="227">Vow them in nature wise as when Love speaks .</l>
      <l n="228">With them is war ; and well the Goddess knows</l>
      <l n="229">What undermines the race who mount the rose ;</l>
      <l n="230">How the ripe moment , lodged in slumberous hours ,</l>
      <l n="231">Enkindled by persuasion overpowers :</l>
      <l n="232">Why weak as are her frailer trailing weeds ,</l>
      <l n="233">The strong when Beauty gleams o'er Nature 's needs ,</l>
      <l n="234">And timely guile unguarded finds them lie .</l>
      <l n="235">They who her sway withstand a sea defy ,</l>
