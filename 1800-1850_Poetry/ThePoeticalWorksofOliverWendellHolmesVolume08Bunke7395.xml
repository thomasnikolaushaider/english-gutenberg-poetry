    <head>GRANDMOTHER 'S STORY OF BUNKER-HILL BATTLE</head>
    <head>AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ T is like stirring living embers when , at eighty , one remembers</l>
     <l n="2">All the achings and the quakings of “ the times that tried men 's souls ” ;</l>
     <l n="3">When I talk of Whig and Tory , when I tell the Rebel story ,</l>
     <l n="4">To you the words are ashes , but to me they 're burning coals .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">I had heard the muskets ’ rattle of the April running battle ;</l>
     <l n="6">Lord Percy 's hunted soldiers , I can see their red-coats still ;</l>
     <l n="7">But a deadly chill comes o'er me , as the day looms up before me ,</l>
     <l n="8">When a thousand men lay bleeding on the slopes of Bunker 's Hill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">‘ T was a peaceful summer 's morning , when the first thing gave us warning</l>
     <l n="10">Was the booming of the cannon from the river and the shore :</l>
     <l n="11">“ Child , ” says grandma , “ what ‘ s the matter , what is all this noise and</l>
     <l n="12">clatter ?</l>
     <l n="13">Have those scalping Indian devils come to murder us once more ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="14">Poor old soul ! my sides were shaking in the midst of all my quaking ,</l>
     <l n="15">To hear her talk of Indians when the guns began to roar :</l>
     <l n="16">She had seen the burning village , and the slaughter and the pillage ,</l>
     <l n="17">When the Mohawks killed her father with their bullets through his door .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="18">Then I said , “ Now , dear old granny , do n't you fret and worry any ,</l>
     <l n="19">For I 'll soon come back and tell you whether this is work or play ;</l>
     <l n="20">There can n't be mischief in it , so I wo n't be gone a minute ” —</l>
     <l n="21">For a minute then I started . I was gone the live-long day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="22">No time for bodice-lacing or for looking-glass grimacing ;</l>
     <l n="23">Down my hair went as I hurried , tumbling half-way to my heels ;</l>
     <l n="24">God forbid your ever knowing , when there 's blood around her flowing ,</l>
     <l n="25">How the lonely , helpless daughter of a quiet house-hold feels !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="26">In the street I heard a thumping ; and I knew it was the stumping</l>
     <l n="27">Of the Corporal , our old neighbor , on that wooden leg he wore ,</l>
     <l n="28">With a knot of women round him , - it was lucky I had found him ,</l>
     <l n="29">So I followed with the others , and the Corporal marched before .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="30">They were making for the steeple ,— the old soldier and his people ;</l>
     <l n="31">The pigeons circled round us as we climbed the creaking stair .</l>
     <l n="32">Just across the narrow river — oh , so close it made me shiver !—</l>
     <l n="33">Stood a fortress on the hill-top that but yesterday was bare .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="34">Not slow our eyes to find it ; well we knew who stood behind it ,</l>
     <l n="35">Though the earthwork hid them from us , and the stubborn walls were dumb</l>
     <l n="36">Here were sister , wife , and mother , looking wild upon each other ,</l>
     <l n="37">And their lips were white with terror as they said , THE HOUR HAS COME !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="38">The morning slowly wasted , not a morsel had we tasted ,</l>
     <l n="39">And our heads were almost splitting with the cannons ’ deafening thrill ,</l>
     <l n="40">When a figure tall and stately round the rampart strode sedately ;</l>
     <l n="41">It was PRESCOTT , one since told me ; he commanded on the hill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="42">Every woman 's heart grew bigger when we saw his manly figure ,</l>
     <l n="43">With the banyan buckled round it , standing up so straight and tall ;</l>
     <l n="44">Like a gentleman of leisure who is strolling out for pleasure ,</l>
     <l n="45">Through the storm of shells and cannon-shot he walked around the wall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="46">At eleven the streets were swarming , for the red-coats ’ ranks were</l>
     <l n="47">forming ;</l>
     <l n="48">At noon in marching order they were moving to the piers ;</l>
     <l n="49">How the bayonets gleamed and glistened , as we looked far down , and</l>
     <l n="50">listened</l>
     <l n="51">To the trampling and the drum-beat of the belted grenadiers !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="52">At length the men have started , with a cheer ( it seemed faint-hearted ) ,</l>
     <l n="53">In their scarlet regimentals , with their knapsacks on their backs ,</l>
     <l n="54">And the reddening , rippling water , as after a sea-fight 's slaughter ,</l>
     <l n="55">Round the barges gliding onward blushed like blood along their tracks .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="56">So they crossed to the other border , and again they formed in order ;</l>
     <l n="57">And the boats came back for soldiers , came for soldiers , soldiers still :</l>
     <l n="58">The time seemed everlasting to us women faint and fasting ,—</l>
     <l n="59">At last they 're moving , marching , marching proudly up the hill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="60">We can see the bright steel glancing all along the lines advancing ,—</l>
     <l n="61">Now the front rank fires a volley ,— they have thrown away their shot ;</l>
     <l n="62">For behind their earthwork lying , all the balls above them flying ,</l>
     <l n="63">Our people need not hurry ; so they wait and answer not .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="64">Then the Corporal , our old cripple ( he would swear sometimes and tipple ) ,</l>
     <l n="65">He had heard the bullets whistle ( in the old French war ) before ,—</l>
     <l n="66">Calls out in words of jeering , just as if they all were hearing ,—</l>
     <l n="67">And his wooden leg thumps fiercely on the dusty belfry floor :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="68">“ Oh ! fire away , ye villains , and earn King George 's shillin 's ,</l>
     <l n="69">But ye ‘ ll waste a ton of powder afore a ‘ rebel ’ falls ;</l>
     <l n="70">You may bang the dirt and welcome , they 're as safe as Dan'l Malcolm</l>
     <l n="71">Ten foot beneath the gravestone that you 've splintered with your balls ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="72">In the hush of expectation , in the awe and trepidation</l>
     <l n="73">Of the dread approaching moment , we are well-nigh breathless all ;</l>
     <l n="74">Though the rotten bars are failing on the rickety belfry railing ,</l>
     <l n="75">We are crowding up against them like the waves against a wall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="76">Just a glimpse ( the air is clearer ) , they are nearer ,— nearer ,— nearer ,</l>
     <l n="77">When a flash — a curling smoke-wreath — then a crash — the steeple shakes —</l>
     <l n="78">The deadly truce is ended ; the tempest 's shroud is rended ;</l>
     <l n="79">Like a morning mist it gathered , like a thunder-cloud it breaks !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="80">Oh the sight our eyes discover as the blue-black smoke blows over !</l>
     <l n="81">The red-coats stretched in windrows as a mower rakes his hay ;</l>
     <l n="82">Here a scarlet heap is lying , there a headlong crowd is flying</l>
     <l n="83">Like a billow that has broken and is shivered into spray .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="84">Then we cried , “ The troops are routed ! they are beat — it can n't be</l>
     <l n="85">doubted !</l>
     <l n="86">God be thanked , the fight is over ! ” — Ah ! the grim old soldier 's smile !</l>
     <l n="87">“ Tell us , tell us why you look so ? ” ( we could hardly speak , we shook so ) ,</l>
     <l n="88">“ Are they beaten ? Are they beaten ? ARE they beaten ? ” — “ Wait a while . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="89">Oh the trembling and the terror ! for too soon we saw our error :</l>
     <l n="90">They are baffled , not defeated ; we have driven them back in vain ;</l>
     <l n="91">And the columns that were scattered , round the colors that were tattered ,</l>
     <l n="92">Toward the sullen , silent fortress turn their belted breasts again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="93">All at once , as we are gazing , lo the roofs of Charlestown blazing !</l>
     <l n="94">They have fired the harmless village ; in an hour it will be down !</l>
     <l n="95">The Lord in heaven confound them , rain his fire and brimstone round them ,</l>
     <l n="96">The robbing , murdering red-coats , that would burn a peaceful town !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="97">They are marching , stern and solemn ; we can see each massive column</l>
     <l n="98">As they near the naked earth-mound with the slanting walls so steep .</l>
     <l n="99">Have our soldiers got faint-hearted , and in noiseless haste departed ?</l>
     <l n="100">Are they panic-struck and helpless ? Are they palsied or asleep ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="101">Now ! the walls they 're almost under ! scarce a rod the foes asunder !</l>
     <l n="102">Not a firelock flashed against them ! up the earth-work they will swarm !</l>
     <l n="103">But the words have scarce been spoken , when the ominous calm is broken ,</l>
     <l n="104">And a bellowing crash has emptied all the vengeance of the storm !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="105">So again , with murderous slaughter , pelted backwards to the water ,</l>
     <l n="106">Fly Pigot 's running heroes and the frightened braves of Howe ;</l>
     <l n="107">And we shout , “ At last they 're done for , it 's their barges they have run</l>
     <l n="108">for :</l>
     <l n="109">They are beaten , beaten , beaten ; and the battle ‘ s over now ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="110">And we looked , poor timid creatures , on the rough old soldier 's features ,</l>
     <l n="111">Our lips afraid to question , but he knew what we would ask :</l>
     <l n="112">“ Not sure , ” he said ; “ keep quiet ,— once more , I guess , they ‘ ll try it —</l>
     <l n="113">Here 's damnation to the cut-throats ! ” — then he handed me his flask ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="114">Saying , “ Gal , you 're looking shaky ; have a drop of old Jamaiky ;</l>
     <l n="115">I ‘ m afeard there ‘ ll be more trouble afore the job is done ” ;</l>
     <l n="116">So I took one scorching swallow ; dreadful faint I felt and hollow ,</l>
     <l n="117">Standing there from early morning when the firing was begun .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="118">All through those hours of trial I had watched a calm clock dial ,</l>
     <l n="119">As the hands kept creeping , creeping ,— they were creeping round to four ,</l>
     <l n="120">When the old man said , “ They 're forming with their bagonets fixed for</l>
     <l n="121">storming :</l>
     <l n="122">It ‘ s the death-grip that 's a coming ,— they will try the works once</l>
     <l n="123">more . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="124">With brazen trumpets blaring , the flames behind them glaring ,</l>
     <l n="125">The deadly wall before them , in close array they come ;</l>
     <l n="126">Still onward , upward toiling , like a dragon 's fold uncoiling ,—</l>
     <l n="127">Like the rattlesnake 's shrill warning the reverberating drum .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="128">Over heaps all torn and gory — shall I tell the fearful story ,</l>
     <l n="129">How they surged above the breastwork , as a sea breaks over a deck ;</l>
     <l n="130">How , driven , yet scarce defeated , our worn-out men retreated ,</l>
     <l n="131">With their powder-horns all emptied , like the swimmers from a wreck ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="132">It has all been told and painted ; as for me , they say I fainted ,</l>
     <l n="133">And the wooden-legged old Corporal stumped with me down the stair :</l>
     <l n="134">When I woke from dreams affrighted the evening lamps were lighted ,—</l>
     <l n="135">On the floor a youth was lying ; his bleeding breast was bare .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="33">
     <l n="136">And I heard through all the flurry , “ Send for WARREN ! hurry ! hurry !</l>
     <l n="137">Tell him here 's a soldier bleeding , and he ‘ ll come and dress his</l>
     <l n="138">wound ! ”</l>
     <l n="139">Ah , we knew not till the morrow told its tale of death and sorrow ,</l>
     <l n="140">How the starlight found him stiffened on the dark and bloody ground .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="34">
     <l n="141">Who the youth was , what his name was , where the place from which he came</l>
     <l n="142">was ,</l>
     <l n="143">Who had brought him from the battle , and had left him at our door ,</l>
     <l n="144">He could not speak to tell us ; but ‘ t was one of our brave fellows ,</l>
     <l n="145">As the homespun plainly showed us which the dying soldier wore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="35">
     <l n="146">For they all thought he was dying , as they gathered round him crying ,—</l>
     <l n="147">And they said , “ Oh , how they 'll miss him ! ” and , “ What will his mother</l>
     <l n="148">do ? ”</l>
     <l n="149">Then , his eyelids just unclosing like a child 's that has been dozing ,</l>
     <l n="150">He faintly murmured , “ Mother ! ” — and — I saw his eyes were blue .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="36">
     <l n="151">“ Why , grandma , how you ‘ re winking ! ” Ah , my child , it sets me thinking</l>
     <l n="152">Of a story not like this one . Well , he somehow lived along ;</l>
     <l n="153">So we came to know each other , and I nursed him like a — mother ,</l>
     <l n="154">Till at last he stood before me , tall , and rosy-checked , and strong .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="37">
     <l n="155">And we sometimes walked together in the pleasant summer weather ,—</l>
     <l n="156">“ Please to tell us what his name was ? ” Just your own , my little dear ,—</l>
     <l n="157">There 's his picture Copley painted : we became so well acquainted ,</l>
     <l n="158">That — in short , that 's why I ‘ m grandma , and you children all are here !</l>

    <head>AT THE “ ATLANTIC ” DINNER</head>
    <head>DECEMBER 15 , 1874</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I SUPPOSE it 's myself that you 're making allusion to</l>
     <l n="2">And bringing the sense of dismay and confusion to .</l>
     <l n="3">Of course some must speak ,— they are always selected to ,</l>
     <l n="4">But pray what 's the reason that I am expected to ?</l>
     <l n="5">I 'm not fond of wasting my breath as those fellows do ;</l>
     <l n="6">That want to be blowing forever as bellows do ;</l>
     <l n="7">Their legs are uneasy , but why will you jog any</l>
     <l n="8">That long to stay quiet beneath the mahogany ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Why , why call me up with your battery of flatteries ?</l>
     <l n="10">You say “ He writes poetry , ” — that ‘ s what the matter is</l>
     <l n="11">“ It costs him no trouble — a pen full of ink or two</l>
     <l n="12">And the poem is done in the time of a wink or two ;</l>
     <l n="13">As for thoughts — never mind — take the ones that lie uppermost ,</l>
     <l n="14">And the rhymes used by Milton and Byron and Tupper most ;</l>
     <l n="15">The lines come so easy ! at one end he jingles ‘ em ,</l>
     <l n="16">At the other with capital letters he shingles ‘ em ,—</l>
     <l n="17">Why , the thing writes itself , and before he 's half done with it</l>
     <l n="18">He hates to stop writing , he has such good fun with it ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">Ah , that is the way in which simple ones go about</l>
     <l n="20">And draw a fine picture of things they do n't know about !</l>
     <l n="21">We all know a kitten , but come to a catamount</l>
     <l n="22">The beast is a stranger when grown up to that amount ,</l>
     <l n="23">( A stranger we rather prefer should  n't visit us ,</l>

     <l n="6">That christens men Your Highness and Your Grace ;</l>
     <l n="7">We tried such names as these awhile , you know ,</l>

    <head>THE SHIP OF STATE</head>
    <head>A SENTIMENT</head>
    <head>This “ sentiment ” was read on the same occasion as the “ Family Record , ” which immediately follows it . The latter poem is the dutiful tribute of a son to his father and his father 's ancestors , residents of Woodstock from its first settlement .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">THE Ship of State ! above her skies are blue ,</l>
     <l n="2">But still she rocks a little , it is true ,</l>
     <l n="3">And there are passengers whose faces white</l>
     <l n="4">Show they do n't feel as happy as they might ;</l>
     <l n="5">Yet on the whole her crew are quite content ,</l>
     <l n="6">Since its wild fury the typhoon has spent ,</l>
     <l n="7">And willing , if her pilot thinks it best ,</l>
     <l n="8">To head a little nearer south by west .</l>
     <l n="9">And this they feel : the ship came too near wreck ,</l>
     <l n="10">In the long quarrel for the quarter-deck ,</l>
     <l n="11">Now when she glides serenely on her way ,—</l>
     <l n="12">The shallows past where dread explosives lay ,—</l>
     <l n="13">The stiff obstructive 's churlish game to try</l>
     <l n="14">Let sleeping dogs and still torpedoes lie !</l>
     <l n="15">And so I give you all the Ship of State ;</l>
     <l n="16">Freedom 's last venture is her priceless freight ;</l>
     <l n="17">God speed her , keep her , bless her , while she steers</l>
     <l n="18">Amid the breakers of unsounded years ;</l>
     <l n="19">Lead her through danger 's paths with even keel ,</l>
     <l n="20">And guide the honest hand that holds her wheel !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">NOT to myself this breath of vesper song ,</l>
     <l n="2">Not to these patient friends , this kindly throng ,</l>
     <l n="3">Not to this hallowed morning , though it be</l>
     <l n="4">Our summer Christmas , Freedom 's jubilee ,</l>
     <l n="5">When every summit , topmast , steeple , tower ,</l>
     <l n="6">That owns her empire spreads her starry flower ,</l>
     <l n="7">Its blood-streaked leaves in heaven 's benignant dew</l>
     <l n="8">Washed clean from every crimson stain they knew ,—</l>
     <l n="9">No , not to these the passing thrills belong</l>
     <l n="10">That steal my breath to hush themselves with song .</l>
     <l n="11">These moments all are memory 's ; I have come</l>
     <l n="12">To speak with lips that rather should be dumb ;</l>
     <l n="13">For what are words ? At every step I tread</l>
     <l n="14">The dust that wore the footprints of the dead</l>
     <l n="15">But for whose life my life had never known</l>
     <l n="16">This faded vesture which it calls its own .</l>
     <l n="17">Here sleeps my father 's sire , and they who gave</l>
     <l n="18">That earlier life here found their peaceful grave .</l>
     <l n="19">In days gone by I sought the hallowed ground ;</l>
     <l n="20">Climbed yon long slope ; the sacred spot I found</l>
     <l n="21">Where all unsullied lies the winter snow ,</l>
     <l n="22">Where all ungathered spring 's pale violets blow ,</l>
     <l n="23">And tracked from stone to stone the Saxon name</l>
     <l n="24">That marks the blood I need not blush to claim ,</l>
     <l n="25">Blood such as warmed the Pilgrim sons of toil ,</l>
     <l n="26">Who held from God the charter of the soil .</l>
     <l n="27">I come an alien to your hills and plains ,</l>
     <l n="28">Yet feel your birthright tingling in my veins ;</l>
     <l n="29">Mine are this changing prospect 's sun and shade ,</l>
     <l n="30">In full-blown summer 's bridal pomp arrayed ;</l>
     <l n="31">Mine these fair hillsides and the vales between ;</l>
     <l n="32">Mine the sweet streams that lend their brightening green ;</l>
     <l n="33">I breathed your air — the sunlit landscape smiled ;</l>
     <l n="34">I touch your soil — it knows its children 's child ;</l>
     <l n="35">Throned in my heart your heritage is mine ;</l>
     <l n="36">I claim it all by memory 's right divine</l>
     <l n="37">Waking , I dream . Before my vacant eyes</l>
     <l n="38">In long procession shadowy forms arise ;</l>
     <l n="39">Far through the vista of the silent years</l>
     <l n="40">I see a venturous band ; the pioneers ,</l>
     <l n="41">Who let the sunlight through the forest 's gloom ,</l>
     <l n="42">Who bade the harvest wave , the garden bloom .</l>
     <l n="43">Hark ! loud resounds the bare-armed settler 's axe ,</l>
     <l n="44">See where the stealthy panther left his tracks !</l>
     <l n="45">As fierce , as stealthy creeps the skulking foe</l>
     <l n="46">With stone-tipped shaft and sinew-corded bow ;</l>
     <l n="47">Soon shall he vanish from his ancient reign ,</l>
     <l n="48">Leave his last cornfield to the coming train ,</l>
     <l n="49">Quit the green margin of the wave he drinks ,</l>
     <l n="50">For haunts that hide the wild-cat and the lynx .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="51">But who the Youth his glistening axe that swings</l>
     <l n="52">To smite the pine that shows a hundred rings ?</l>
     <l n="53">His features ?— something in his look I find</l>
     <l n="54">That calls the semblance of my race to mind .</l>
     <l n="55">His name ?— my own ; and that which goes before</l>
     <l n="56">The same that once the loved disciple bore .</l>
     <l n="57">Young , brave , discreet , the father of a line</l>
     <l n="58">Whose voiceless lives have found a voice in mine ;</l>
     <l n="59">Thinned by unnumbered currents though they be ,</l>

     <l n="61">The seasons pass ; the roses come and go ;</l>

     <l n="64">Have found their mates ; a gravestone here and there</l>
     <l n="65">Tells where the fathers lie ; the silvered hair</l>
     <l n="66">Of some bent patriarch yet recalls the time</l>
     <l n="67">That saw his feet the northern hillside climb ,</l>
     <l n="68">A pilgrim from the pilgrims far away ,</l>
     <l n="69">The godly men , the dwellers by the bay .</l>
     <l n="70">On many a hearthstone burns the cheerful fire ;</l>
     <l n="71">The schoolhouse porch , the heavenward pointing spire</l>
     <l n="72">Proclaim in letters every eye can read ,</l>
     <l n="73">Knowledge and Faith , the new world 's simple creed .</l>
     <l n="74">Hush ! ‘ t is the Sabbath 's silence-stricken morn</l>
     <l n="75">No feet must wander through the tasselled corn ;</l>
     <l n="76">No merry children laugh around the door ,</l>
     <l n="77">No idle playthings strew the sanded floor ;</l>
     <l n="78">The law of Moses lays its awful ban</l>
     <l n="79">On all that stirs ; here comes the tithing-man</l>
     <l n="80">At last the solemn hour of worship calls ;</l>
     <l n="81">Slowly they gather in the sacred walls ;</l>
     <l n="82">Man in his strength and age with knotted staff ,</l>
     <l n="83">And boyhood aching for its week-day laugh ,</l>
     <l n="84">The toil-worn mother with the child she leads ,</l>
     <l n="85">The maiden , lovely in her golden beads ,—</l>
     <l n="86">The popish symbols round her neck she wears ,</l>
     <l n="87">But on them counts her lovers , not her prayers ,—</l>
     <l n="88">Those youths in homespun suits and ribboned queues ,</l>
     <l n="89">Whose hearts are beating in the high-backed pews .</l>
     <l n="90">The pastor rises ; looks along the seats</l>
     <l n="91">With searching eye ; each wonted face he meets ;</l>
     <l n="92">Asks heavenly guidance ; finds the chapter 's place</l>
     <l n="93">That tells some tale of Israel 's stubborn race ;</l>
     <l n="94">Gives out the sacred song ; all voices join ,</l>
     <l n="95">For no quartette extorts their scanty coin ;</l>
     <l n="96">Then while both hands their black-gloved palms display ,</l>
     <l n="97">Lifts his gray head , and murmurs , “ Let us pray ! ”</l>
     <l n="98">And pray he does ! as one that never fears</l>
     <l n="99">To plead unanswered by the God that hears ;</l>
     <l n="100">What if he dwells on many a fact as though</l>
     <l n="101">Some things Heaven knew not which it ought to know ,—</l>
     <l n="102">Thanks God for all his favors past , and yet ,</l>
     <l n="103">Tells Him there 's something He must not forget ;</l>
     <l n="104">Such are the prayers his people love to hear ,—</l>
     <l n="105">See how the Deacon slants his listening ear !</l>
     <l n="106">What ! look once more ! Nay , surely there I trace</l>
     <l n="107">The hinted outlines of a well-known face !</l>
     <l n="108">Not those the lips for laughter to beguile ,</l>
     <l n="109">Yet round their corners lurks an embryo smile ,</l>
     <l n="110">The same on other lips my childhood knew</l>
     <l n="111">That scarce the Sabbath 's mastery could subdue .</l>
     <l n="112">Him too my lineage gives me leave to claim ,—</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="114">And still in ceaseless round the seasons passed ;</l>
     <l n="115">Spring piped her carol ; Autumn blew his blast ;</l>
     <l n="116">Babes waxed to manhood ; manhood shrunk to age ;</l>
     <l n="117">Life 's worn-out players tottered off the stage ;</l>
     <l n="118">The few are many ; boys have grown to men</l>
     <l n="119">Since Putnam dragged the wolf from Pomfret 's den ;</l>
     <l n="120">Our new-old Woodstock is a thriving town ;</l>
     <l n="121">Brave are her children ; faithful to the crown ;</l>
     <l n="122">Her soldiers ’ steel the savage redskin knows ;</l>
     <l n="123">Their blood has crimsoned his Canadian snows .</l>
     <l n="124">And now once more along the quiet vale</l>
     <l n="125">Rings the dread call that turns the mothers pale ;</l>
     <l n="126">Full well they know the valorous heat that runs</l>
     <l n="127">In every pulse-beat of their loyal sons ;</l>
     <l n="128">Who would not bleed in good King George 's cause</l>
     <l n="129">When England 's lion shows his teeth and claws ?</l>
     <l n="130">With glittering firelocks on the village green</l>
     <l n="131">In proud array a martial band is seen ;</l>
     <l n="132">You know what names those ancient rosters hold ,—</l>
     <l n="133">Whose belts were buckled when the drum-beat rolled ,—</l>
     <l n="134">But mark their Captain ! tell us , who is he ?</l>
     <l n="135">On his brown face that same old look I see</l>
     <l n="136">Yes ! from the homestead 's still retreat he came ,</l>
     <l n="137">Whose peaceful owner bore the Psalmist 's name ;</l>
     <l n="138">The same his own . Well , Israel 's glorious king</l>
     <l n="139">Who struck the harp could also whirl the sling ,—</l>
     <l n="140">Breathe in his song a penitential sigh</l>
     <l n="141">And smite the sons of Amalek hip and thigh :</l>
     <l n="142">These shared their task ; one deaconed out the psalm ,</l>
     <l n="143">One slashed the scalping hell-hounds of calm ;</l>
     <l n="144">The praying father 's pious work is done ,</l>
     <l n="145">Now sword in hand steps forth the fighting son .</l>
     <l n="146">On many a field he fought in wilds afar ;</l>
     <l n="147">See on his swarthy cheek the bullet 's scar !</l>
     <l n="148">There hangs a murderous tomahawk ; beneath ,</l>
     <l n="149">Without its blade , a knife 's embroidered sheath ;</l>
     <l n="150">Save for the stroke his trusty weapon dealt</l>
     <l n="151">His scalp had dangled at their owner 's belt ;</l>
     <l n="152">But not for him such fate ; he lived to see</l>
     <l n="153">The bloodier strife that made our nation free ,</l>
     <l n="154">To serve with willing toil , with skilful hand ,</l>
     <l n="155">The war-worn saviors of the bleeding land .</l>
     <l n="156">His wasting life to others ’ needs he gave ,—</l>
     <l n="157">Sought rest in home and found it in the grave .</l>
     <l n="158">See where the stones life 's brief memorials keep ,</l>
     <l n="159">The tablet telling where he “ fell on sleep , ” —</l>
     <l n="160">Watched by a winged cherub 's rayless eye ,—</l>
     <l n="161">A scroll above that says we all must die ,—</l>

     <l n="171">The village paths so well thy boyhood knew ,</l>
     <l n="172">Along the tangled margin of the stream</l>
     <l n="173">Whose murmurs blended with thine infant dream ,</l>

     <l n="177">Where sloped the roof that sheds the rains no more ,</l>
     <l n="178">Where one last relic still remains to tell</l>
     <l n="179">Here stood thy home ,— the memory-haunted well ,</l>
     <l n="180">Whose waters quench a deeper thirst than thine ,</l>
     <l n="181">Changed at my lips to sacramental wine ,—</l>

     <l n="183">The scanty records of thine honored race ,</l>
     <l n="184">Call up the forms that earlier years have known ,</l>
     <l n="185">And spell the legend of each slanted stone ?</l>
     <l n="186">With thoughts of thee my loving verse began ,</l>

     <l n="188">Not for the many listeners , but the few</l>
     <l n="189">Whose fathers trod the paths my fathers knew ;</l>
     <l n="190">Still in my heart thy loved remembrance burns ;</l>
     <l n="191">Still to my lips thy cherished name returns ;</l>
     <l n="192">Could I but feel thy gracious presence near</l>
     <l n="193">Amid the groves that once to thee were dear</l>
     <l n="194">Could but my trembling lips with mortal speech</l>
     <l n="195">Thy listening ear for one brief moment reach !</l>
     <l n="196">How vain the dream ! The pallid voyager 's track</l>
     <l n="197">No sign betrays ; he sends no message back .</l>
     <l n="198">No word from thee since evening 's shadow fell</l>
     <l n="199">On thy cold forehead with my long farewell ,—</l>
     <l n="200">Now from the margin of the silent sea ,</l>
     <l n="201">Take my last offering ere I cross to thee !</l>
