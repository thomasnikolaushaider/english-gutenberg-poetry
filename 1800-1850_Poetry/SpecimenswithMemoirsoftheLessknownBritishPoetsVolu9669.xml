   <p>INDEX</p>
   <p>SPECIMENS , WITH MEMOIRS , OF THE LESS-KNOWN BRITISH POETS .</p>
   <p>THIRD PERIOD .</p>
   <p>FROM DRYDEN TO COWPER .</p>
   <p>SIR CHARLES SEDLEY .</p>
   <p>Sedley was one of those characters who exert a personal fascination over their own age without leaving any works behind them to perpetuate the charm to posterity . He was the son of Sir John Sedley of Aylesford , in Kent , and was born in 1639 . When the Restoration took place he repaired to London , and plunged into all the licence of the time , shedding , however , over the putrid pool the sheen of his wit , manners , and genius . Charles was so delighted with him , that he is said to have asked him whether he had not obtained a patent from Nature to be Apollo 's viceroy . He cracked jests , issued lampoons , wrote poems and plays , and , despite some great blunders , was universally admired and loved . When his comedy of ‘ Bellamira ’ was acted , the roof fell in , and a few , including the author , were slightly injured . When a parasite told him that the fire of the play had blown up the poet , house and all , Sedley replied , ‘ No ; the play was so heavy that it broke down the house , and buried the poet in his own rubbish . ’ Latterly he sobered down , entered parliament , attended closely to public business , and became a determined opponent of the arbitrary measures of James II . To this he was stimulated by a personal reason . James had seduced Sedley 's daughter , and made her Countess of Dorchester . ‘ For making my daughter a countess , ’ the father said , ‘ I have helped to make his daughter ’ ( Mary , Princess of Orange ,) ‘ a queen . ’ Sedley , thus talking , acting , and writing , lived on till he was sixty - two years of age . He died in 1701 .</p>
   <p>He has left nothing that the world can cherish , except such light and graceful songs , sparkling rather with point than with poetry , as we quote below .</p>

     <l n="1">1 Ah , Chloris ! that I now could sit</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">4 But as your charms insensibly</l>
     <l n="14">To their perfection pressed ,</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>JOHN POMFRET ,</head>
    <head>The author of the once popular ‘ Choice , ’ was born in 1667 . He was the son of the rector of Luton , in Bedfordshire , and , after attending Queen 's College , Cambridge , himself entered the Church . He became minister of Malden , which is also situated in Bedfordshire , and there he wrote and , in 1699 , published a volume of poems , including some Pindaric essays , in the style of Cowley and ‘ The Choice . ’ He might have risen higher in his profession , but Dr Compton , Bishop of London , was prejudiced against him on account of the following lines in the ‘ Choice : ’ —</head>
     <l n="1">‘ And as I near approached the verge of life ,</l>
     <l n="2">Some kind relation ( for I 'd have no wife )</l>
     <l n="3">Should take upon him all my worldly care ,</l>
     <l n="4">Whilst I did for a better state prepare . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The words in the second line , coupled with a glowing description , in a previous part of the poem , of his ideal of an ‘ obliging modest fair ’ one , near whom he wished to live , led to the suspicion that he preferred a mistress to a wife . In vain did he plead that he was actually a married man . His suit for a better living made no progress , and while dancing attendance on his patron in London he caught small-pox , and died in 1703 , in the thirty-sixth year of his age .</p>
   <p>His Pindaric odes , &amp; c ., are feeble spasms , and need not detain us . His ‘ Reason ’ shews considerable capacity and common sense . His ‘ Choice ’ opens up a pleasing vista , down which our quiet ancestors delighted to look , but by which few now can be attracted . We quote a portion of what a biographer calls a ‘ modest ’ preface , which Pomfret prefixed to his poems :— ‘ To please every one would be a new thing , and to write so as to please nobody would be as new ; for even Quarles and Withers have their admirers . It is not the multitude of applauses , but the good sense of the applauders which establishes a valuable reputation ; and if a Rymer or a Congreve say it is well , he will not be at all solicitous how great the majority be to the contrary . ’ How strangely are opinions now altered ! Rymer was some time ago characterised by Macaulay as the worst critic that ever lived , and Quarles and Withers have now many admirers , while ‘ The Choice ’ and its ill-fated author are nearly forgotten .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE CHOICE .</head>
     <l n="1">If Heaven the grateful liberty would give ,</l>
     <l n="2">That I might choose my method how to live ,</l>
     <l n="3">And all those hours propitious fate should lend ,</l>
     <l n="4">In blissful ease and satisfaction spend ,</l>
     <l n="5">Near some fair town I 'd have a private seat ,</l>
     <l n="6">Built uniform , not little , nor too great :</l>
     <l n="7">Better , if on a rising ground it stood ,</l>
     <l n="8">On this side fields , on that a neighbouring wood .</l>
     <l n="9">It should within no other things contain ,</l>
     <l n="10">But what are useful , necessary , plain :</l>
     <l n="11">Methinks ‘ tis nauseous , and I 'd ne'er endure ,</l>
     <l n="12">The needless pomp of gaudy furniture .</l>
     <l n="13">A little garden , grateful to the eye ;</l>
     <l n="14">And a cool rivulet run murmuring by ,</l>
     <l n="15">On whose delicious banks , a stately row</l>
     <l n="16">Of shady limes or sycamores should grow .</l>
     <l n="17">At the end of which a silent study placed ,</l>
     <l n="18">Should be with all the noblest authors graced :</l>
     <l n="19">Horace and Virgil , in whose mighty lines</l>
     <l n="20">Immortal wit and solid learning shines ;</l>
     <l n="21">Sharp Juvenal , and amorous Ovid too ,</l>
     <l n="22">Who all the turns of love 's soft passion knew ;</l>
     <l n="23">He that with judgment reads his charming lines ,</l>
     <l n="24">In which strong art with stronger nature joins ,</l>
     <l n="25">Must grant his fancy does the best excel ;</l>
     <l n="26">His thoughts so tender , and expressed so well ;</l>
     <l n="27">With all those moderns , men of steady sense ,</l>
     <l n="28">Esteemed for learning and for eloquence .</l>
     <l n="29">In some of these , as fancy should advise ,</l>
     <l n="30">I 'd always take my morning exercise ;</l>
     <l n="31">For sure no minutes bring us more content ,</l>
     <l n="32">Than those in pleasing , useful studies spent .</l>
     <l n="33">I 'd have a clear and competent estate ,</l>
     <l n="34">That I might live genteelly , but not great ;</l>
     <l n="35">As much as I could moderately spend ,</l>
     <l n="36">A little more sometimes t ’ oblige a friend .</l>
     <l n="37">Nor should the sons of poverty repine</l>
     <l n="38">Too much at fortune ; they should taste of mine ;</l>
     <l n="39">And all that objects of true pity were ,</l>
     <l n="40">Should be relieved with what my wants could spare ;</l>
     <l n="41">For that our Maker has too largely given ,</l>
     <l n="42">Should be returned in gratitude to Heaven .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>THE EARL OF DORSET .</p>
   <p>This noble earl was rather a patron of poets than a poet , and possessed more wit than genius . Charles Sackville was born on the 24th January 1637 . He was descended directly from the famous Thomas , Lord Buckhurst . He was educated under a private tutor , travelled in Italy , and returned in time to witness the Restoration . In the first parliament thereafter , he sat for East Grinstead , in Surrey , and might have distinguished himself , had he not determined , in common with almost all the wits of the time , to run a preliminary career of dissipation . What a proof of the licentiousness of these times is to be found in the fact , that young Lord Buckhurst , Sir Charles Sedley , and Sir Thomas Ogle were fined for exposing themselves , drunk and naked , in indecent postures on the public street ! In 1665 , the erratic energies of Buckhurst found a more legitimate vent in the Dutch war . He attended the Duke of York in the great sea-fight of the 3d June , in which Opdam , the Dutch admiral , was , with all his crew , blown up . He is said to have composed the song , quoted afterwards , ‘ To all you ladies now at land , ’ on the evening before the battle , although Dr Johnson ( who observes that seldom any splendid story is wholly true ) maintains that its composition cost him a whole week , and that he only retouched it on that remarkable evening . Buckhurst was soon after made a gentleman of the bed-chamber , and despatched on short embassies to France . In 1674 , his uncle , James Cranfield , the Earl of Middlesex , died , and left him his estate , and the next year the title , too , was conferred on him . In 1677 , he became , by the death of his father , Earl of Dorset , and inherited the family estate . In 1684 , his wife , whose name was Bagot , and by whom he had no children , died , and he soon after married a daughter of the Earl of Northampton , who is said to have been celebrated both for understanding and beauty . Dorset was courted by James , but found it impossible to coincide with his violent measures , and when the bishops were tried at Westminster Hall , he , along with some other lords , appeared to countenance them . He concurred with the Revolution settlement , and , after William 's accession , was created lord chamberlain of the household , and received the Order of the Garter . His attendance on the king , however , eventually cost him his life , for having been tossed with him in an open boat on the coast of Holland for sixteen hours , in very rough weather , he caught an illness from which he never recovered . On 19th January 1705-6 , he died at Bath .</p>
   <p>During his life , Dorset was munificent in his kindness to such men of genius as Prior and Dryden , who repaid him in the current coin of the poor Parnassus of their day — gross adulation . He is now remembered mainly for his spirited war-song , and for such pointed lines in his satire on Edward Howard , the notorious author of ‘ British Princes , ’ as the following :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ They lie , dear Ned , who say thy brain is barren ,</l>
     <l n="2">When deep conceits , like maggots , breed in carrion ;</l>
     <l n="3">Thy stumbling , foundered jade can trot as high</l>
     <l n="4">As any other Pegasus can fly .</l>
     <l n="5">So the dull eel moves nimbler in the mud</l>
     <l n="6">Than all the swift-finned racers of the flood .</l>
     <l n="7">As skilful divers to the bottom fall</l>
     <l n="8">Sooner than those who cannot swim at all ,</l>
     <l n="9">So in this way of writing without thinking ,</l>
     <l n="10">Thou hast a strange alacrity in sinking . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">This last line has not only become proverbial , but forms the distinct</l>
     <l n="12">germ of ‘ The Dunciad . ’</l>

    <head>JOHN PHILIPS .</head>
    <head>Bampton in Oxfordshire was the birthplace of this poet . He was born on the 30th of December 1676 . His father , Dr Stephen Philips , was archdeacon of Salop , as well as minister of Bampton . John , after some preliminary training at home , was sent to Winchester , where he distinguished himself by diligence and good-nature , and enjoyed two great luxuries ,— the reading of Milton , and the having his head combed by some one while he sat still and in rapture for hours together . This pleasure he shared with Vossius , and with humbler persons of our acquaintance ; the combing of whose hair , they tell us ,</head>

     <l n="2">And brings all heaven before their eyes . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">In 1694 , he entered Christ Church , Cambridge . His intention was to</l>
     <l n="4">prosecute the study of medicine , and he took great delight in the</l>
     <l n="5">cognate pursuits of natural history and botany . His chief friend was</l>
     <l n="6">Edmund Smith , ( Rag Smith , as he was generally called ,) a kind of minor</l>
     <l n="7">Savage , well known in these times as the author of ‘ Phaedra and</l>
     <l n="8">Hippolytus , ’ and for his cureless dissipation . In 1703 , Philips produced</l>
     <l n="9">‘ The Splendid Shilling , ’ which proved a hit , and seems to have diverted</l>
     <l n="10">his aspirations from the domains of Aesculapius to those of Apollo .</l>
     <l n="11">Bolingbroke sought him out , and employed him , after the battle of</l>
     <l n="12">Blenheim , to sing it in opposition to Addison , the laureate of the</l>
     <l n="13">Whigs . At the house of the magnificent but unprincipled St John , Philips</l>
     <l n="14">wrote his ‘ Blenheim , ’ which was published in 1705 . The year after , his</l>
     <l n="15">‘ Cider , ’ a poem in two books , appeared , and was received with great</l>
     <l n="16">applause . Encouraged by this , he projected a poem on the Last Day ,</l>
     <l n="17">which all who are aware of the difficulties of the subject , and the</l>
     <l n="18">limitations of the author 's genius , must rejoice that he never wrote .</l>
     <l n="19">Consumption and asthma removed him prematurely on the 15th of February</l>
     <l n="20">1708 , ere he had completed his thirty-third year . He was buried in</l>
     <l n="21">Hereford Cathedral , and Sir Simon Harcourt , afterwards Lord Chancellor ,</l>
     <l n="22">erected a monument to his memory in Westminster Abbey .</l>

   <p>Bulwer somewhere records a story of John Martin in his early days . He was , on one occasion , reduced to his last shilling . He had kept it , out of a heap , from a partiality to its appearance . It was very bright . He was compelled , at last , to part with it . He went out to a baker 's shop to purchase a loaf with his favourite shilling . He had got the loaf into his hands , when the baker discovered that the shilling was a bad one , and poor Martin had to resign the loaf , and take back his dear , bright , bad shilling once more . Length of time and cold criticism in like manner have reduced John Philips to his solitary ‘ Splendid Shilling . ’ But , though bright , it is far from bad . It is one of the cleverest of parodies , and is perpetrated against one of those colossal works which the smiles of a thousand caricatures were unable to injure . No great or good poem was ever hurt by its parody :— the ‘ Paradise Lost ’ was not by ‘ The Splendid Shilling ’ — ‘ The Last Man ’ of Campbell was not by ‘ The Last Man ’ of Hood — nor the ‘ Lines on the Burial of Sir John Moore ’ by their witty , well-known caricature ; and if ‘ The Vision of Judgment ’ by Southey was laughed into oblivion by Byron 's poem with the same title , it was because Southey 's original was neither good nor great . Philip 's poem , too , is the first of the kind ; and surely we should be thankful to the author of the earliest effort in a style which has created so much innocent amusement . Dr Johnson speaks as if the pleasure arising from such productions implied a malignant ‘ momentary triumph over that grandeur which had hitherto held its captives in admiration . ’ We think , on the contrary , that it springs from our deep interest in the original production , making us alive to the strange resemblance the caricature bears to it . It is our love that provokes our laughter , and hence the admirers of the parodied poem are more delighted than its enemies . At all events , it is by ‘ The Splendid Shilling ’ alone — and that principally from its connexion with Milton 's great work — that Philips is memorable . His ‘ Cider ’ has soured with age , and the loud echo of his Blenheim battle-piece has long since died away .</p>

   <p>We may here mention a name or two of poets from whose verses we can afford no extracts ,— such as Walsh , called by Pope ‘ knowing Walsh , ’ a man of some critical discernment , if not of much genius ; Gould , a domestic of the Earl of Dorset , and afterwards a schoolmaster , from whom Campbell quotes one or two tolerable songs ; and Dr Walter Pope , a man of wit and knowledge , who was junior proctor of Oxford , one of the first chosen fellows of the Royal Society , and who succeeded Sir Christopher Wren as professor of astronomy in Gresham College . He is the author of a comico-serious song of some merit , entitled ‘ The Old Man 's Wish . ’</p>
   <p>SIR SAMUEL GARTH .</p>
   <p>Of Garth little is known , save that he was an eminent physician , a scholar , a man of benevolence , a keen Whig , and yet an admirer of old Dryden , and a patron of young Pope — a friend of Addison , and the author of the ‘ Dispensary . ’ The College of Physicians had instituted a dispensary , for the purpose of furnishing the poor with medicines gratis . This measure was opposed by the apothecaries , who had an obvious interest in the sale of drugs ; and to ridicule their selfishness Garth wrote his poem , which is mock-heroic , in six cantos , copied in form from the ‘ Lutrin , ’ and which , though ingenious and elaborate , seems now tedious , and on the whole uninteresting . It appeared in 1696 , and the author died in 1718 . We extract some of the opening lines of the first canto of the poem .</p>

   <p>SIR RICHARD BLACKMORE .</p>
   <p>Our next name is that of one who , like the former , was a knight , a physician , and ( in a manner ) a poet . Blackmore was the son of Robert Blackmore of Corsham , in Wiltshire , who is styled by Wood gentleman , and is believed to have been an attorney . He took his degree of M. A . at Oxford , in June 1676 . He afterwards travelled , was made Doctor of Physic at Padua , and , when he returned home , began to practise in London with great success . In 1695 , he tried his hand at poetry , producing an epic entitled ‘ King Arthur , ’ which was followed by a series on ‘ King Alfred , ’ ‘ Queen Elizabeth , ’ ‘ Redemption , ’ ‘ The Creation , ’ &amp; c. Some of these productions were popular ; one , ‘ The Creation , ’ has been highly praised by Dr Johnson ; but most of them were heavy . Matthew Henry has preserved portions in his valuable Commentary . Blackmore , a man of excellent character and of extensive medical practice , was yet the laughingstock of the wits , perhaps as much for his piety as for his prosiness . Old , rich , and highly respected , he died on the 8th of October 1729 , while some of his poetic persecutors came to a disgraceful or an early end .</p>
   <p>We quote the satire of John Gay , as one of the cleverest and best conditioned , although one of the coarsest of the attacks made on poor Sir Richard :—</p>

   <p>ELIJAH FENTON .</p>
   <p>This author , who was very much respected by his contemporaries , and who translated a portion of the Odyssey in conjunction with Pope , was born May 20 , 1683 , at Newcastle , in Staffordshire ; studied at Cambridge , which , owing to his nonjuring principles , he had to leave without a degree ; and passed part of his life as a schoolmaster , and part of it as secretary to Charles , Earl of Orrery . By his tragedy of ‘ Mariamne ’ he secured a moderate competence ; and during his latter years , spent his life comfortably as tutor in the house of Lady Trumbull . He died in 1730 . His accomplishments were superior , and his character excellent . Pope , who was indebted to him for the first , fourth , nineteenth , and twentieth of the books of the Odyssey , mourns his loss in one of his most sincere-seeming letters . Fenton edited Waller and Milton , wrote a brief life of the latter poet ,— with which most of our readers are acquainted ,— and indited some respectable verse .</p>

   <p>ROBERT CRAWFORD .</p>
   <p>Robert Crawford , a Scotchman , is our next poet . Of him we know only that he was the brother of Colonel Crawford of Achinames ; that he assisted Allan Ramsay in the ‘ Tea-Table Miscellany ; ’ and was drowned when coming from France in 1733 . Besides the popular song , ‘ The Bush aboon Traquair , ’ which we quote , Crawford wrote also a lyric , called ‘ Tweedside , ’ and some verses , mentioned by Burns , to the old tune of ‘ Cowdenknowes . ’</p>

   <p>THOMAS TICKELL .</p>
   <p>Tickell is now chiefly remembered from his connexion with Addison . He was born in 1686 , at Bridekirk , near Carlisle . In April 1701 , he became a member of Queen 's College in Oxford . In 1708 , he was made M. A ., and two years after was chosen Fellow . He held his Fellowship till 1726 , when , marrying in Dublin , he necessarily vacated it . He attracted Addison 's attention first by some elegant lines in praise of Rosamond , and then by the ‘ Prospect of Peace , ’ a poem in which Tickell , although called by Swift Whiggissimus , for once took the Tory side . This poem Addison , in spite of its politics , praised highly in the Spectator , which led to a lifelong friendship between them . Tickell commenced contributing to the Spectator , among other things publishing there a poem entitled the ‘ Royal Progress . ’ Some time after , he produced a translation of the first book of the Iliad , which Addison declared to be superior to Pope 's . This led the latter to imagine that it was Addison 's own , although it is now , we believe , certain , from the MS ., which still exists , that it was a veritable production of Tickell 's . When Addison went to Ireland , as secretary to Lord Sunderland , Tickell accompanied him , and was employed in public business . When Addison became Secretary of State , he made Tickell Under-Secretary ; and when he died , he left him the charge of publishing his works , with an earnest recommendation to the care of Craggs . Tickell faithfully performed the task , prefixing to them an elegy on his departed friend , which is now his own chief title to fame . In 1725 , he was made secretary to the Lords-Justices of Ireland , a place of great trust and honour , and which he retained till his death . This event happened at Bath , in the year 1740 .</p>
   <p>His genius was not strong , but elegant and refined , and appears , as we have just stated , to best advantage in his lines on Addison 's death , which are warm with genuine love , tremulous with sincere sorrow , and shine with a sober splendour , such as Addison 's own exquisite taste would have approved .</p>

   <p>JAMES HAMMOND .</p>
   <p>This elegiast was the second son of Anthony Hammond , a brother-in-law of Sir Robert Walpole , and a man of some note in his day . He was born in 1710 ; educated at Westminster school ; became equerry to the Prince of Wales ; fell in love with a lady named Dashwood , who rejected him , and drove him to temporary derangement , and then to elegy-writing ; entered parliament for Truro , in Cornwall , in 1741 ; and died the next year . His elegies were published after his death , and , although abounding in pedantic allusions and frigid conceits , became very popular .</p>

   <p>RICHARD SAVAGE .</p>
   <p>The extreme excellence , fulness , and popularity of Johnson 's Life of Savage must excuse our doing more than mentioning the leading dates of his history . He was the son of the Earl of Rivers and the Countess of Macclesfield , and was born in London , 1698 . His mother , who had begot him in adultery after having openly avowed her criminality , in order to obtain a divorce from her husband , placed the boy under the care of a poor woman , who brought him up as her son . His maternal grandmother , Lady Mason , however , took an interest him and placed him at a grammar school at St Alban 's . He was afterwards apprenticed to a shoemaker . On the death of his nurse , he found some letters which led to the discovery of his real parent . He applied to her , accordingly , to be acknowledged as her son ; but she repulsed his every advance , and persecuted him with unrelenting barbarity . He found , however , some influential friends , such as Steele , Fielding , Aaron Hill , Pope , and Lord Tyrconnell . He was , however , his own worst enemy , and contracted habits of the most irregular description . In a tavern brawl he killed one James Sinclair , and was condemned to die ; but , notwithstanding his mother 's interference to prevent the exercise of the royal clemency , he was pardoned by the queen , who afterwards gave him a pension of £ 50 a-year . He supported himself in a precarious way by writing poetical pieces . Lord Tyrconnell took him for a while into his house , and allowed him £ 200 a-year , but he soon quarrelled with him , and left . When the queen died he lost his pension , but his friends made it up by an annuity to the same amount . He went away to reside at Swansea , but on occasion of a visit he made to Bristol he was arrested for a small debt , and in the prison he sickened , and died on the 1st of August 1743 . He was only forty-five years of age .</p>
   <p>After all , Savage , in Johnson 's Life , is just a dung-fly preserved in amber . His ‘ Bastard , ’ indeed , displays considerable powers , stung by a consciousness of wrong into convulsive action ; but his other works are nearly worthless , and his life was that of a proud , passionate , selfish , and infatuated fool , unredeemed by scarcely one trait of genuine excellence in character . We love and admire , even while we deeply blame , such men as Burns ; but for Savage our feeling is a curious compost of sympathy with his misfortunes , contempt for his folly , and abhorrence for the ingratitude , licentiousness , and other coarse and savage sins which characterised and prematurely destroyed him .</p>

   <p>THOMAS WARTON THE ELDER .</p>
   <p>The Wartons were a poetical race . The father of Thomas and Joseph , names so intimately associated with English poetry , was himself a poet . He was of Magdalene College in Oxford , vicar of Basingstoke and Cobham , and twice chosen poetry professor . He was born in 1687 , and died in 1745 .

   <p>JONATHAN SWIFT .</p>
   <p>In contemplating the lives and works of the preceding poets in this third volume of ‘ Specimens , ’ we have been impressed with a sense , if not of their absolute , yet of their comparative mediocrity . Beside such neglected giants as Henry More , Joseph Beaumont , and Andrew Marvell , the Pomfrets , Sedleys , Blackmores , and Savages sink into insignificance . But when we come to the name of Swift , we feel ourselves again approaching an Alpine region . The air of a stern mountain-summit breathes chill around our temples , and we feel that if we have no amiability to melt , we have altitude at least to measure , and strange profound secrets of nature , like the ravines of lofty hills , to explore . The men of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries may be compared to Lebanon , or Snowdown , or Benlomond towering grandly over fertile valleys , on which they smile — Swift to the tremendous Romsdale Horn in Norway , shedding abroad , from a brow of four thousand feet high , what seems a scowl of settled indignation , as if resolved not to rejoice even over the wide - stretching deserts which , and nothing but which , it everlastingly beholds . Mountains all of them , but what a difference between such a mountain as Shakspeare , and such a mountain as Swift !</p>
   <p>Instead of going minutely over a path so long since trodden to mire as the life of Swift , let us expend a page or two in seeking to form some estimate of his character and genius . It is refreshing to come upon a new thing in the world , even though it be a strange or even a bad thing ; and certainly , in any age and country , such a being as Swift must have appeared an anomaly , not for his transcendent goodness , not for his utter badness , but because the elements of good and evil were mixed in him into a medley so astounding , and in proportions respectively so large , yet unequal , that the analysis of the two seemed to many competent only to the Great Chymist , Death , and that a sense of the disproportion seems to have moved the man himself to inextinguishable laughter ,— a laughter which , radiating out of his own singular heart as a centre , swept over the circumference of all beings within his reach , and returned crying , ‘ Give , give , ’ as if he were demanding a universal sphere for the exercise of the savage scorn which dwelt within him , and as if he laughed not more ‘ consumedly ’ at others than he did at himself .</p>
   <p>Ere speaking of Swift as a man , let us say something about his genius . That , like his character , was intensely peculiar . It was a compound of infinite ingenuity , with very little poetical imagination — of gigantic strength , with a propensity to incessant trifling — of passionate purpose , with the clearest and coldest expression , as though a furnace were fuelled with snow . A Brobdignagian by size , he was for ever toying with Lilliputian slings and small craft . One of the most violent of party men , and often fierce as a demoniac in temper , his favourite motto was Vive la bagatelle . The creator of entire new worlds , we doubt if his works contain more than two or three lines of genuine poetry . He may be compared to one of the locusts of the Apocalypse , in that he had a tail like unto a scorpion , and a sting in his tail ; but his ‘ face is not as the face of man , his hair is not as the hair of women , and on his head there is no crown like gold . ’ All Swift 's creations are more or less disgusting . Not one of them is beautiful . His Lilliputians are amazingly life-like , but compare them to Shakspeare 's fairies , such as Peaseblossom , Cobweb , and Mustardseed ; his Brobdignagians are excrescences like enormous warts ; and his Yahoos might have been spawned in the nightmare of a drunken butcher . The same coarseness characterises his poems and his ‘ Tale of a Tub . ’ He might well , however , in his old age , exclaim , in reference to the latter , ‘ Good God ! what a genius I had when I wrote that book ! ’ It is the wildest , wittiest , wickedest , wealthiest book of its size in the English language . Thoughts and figures swarm in every corner of its pages , till you think of a disturbed nest of angry ants , for all the figures and thoughts are black and bitter . One would imagine the book to have issued from a mind that had been gathering gall as well as sense in an antenatal state of being .</p>
   <p>Swift , in all his writings — sermons , political tracts , poems , and fictions — is essentially a satirist . He consisted originally of three principal parts ,— sense , an intense feeling of the ludicrous , and selfish passion ; and these were sure , in certain circumstances , to ferment into a spirit of satire , ‘ strong as death , and cruel as the grave . ’ Born with not very much natural benevolence , with little purely poetic feeling , with furious passions and unbounded ambition , he was entirely dependent for his peace of mind upon success . Had he become , as by his talents he was entitled to be , the prime minister of his day , he would have figured as a greater tyrant in the cabinet than even Chatham . But as he was prevented from being the first statesman , he became the first satirist of his time . From vain efforts to grasp supremacy for himself and his party , he retired growling to his Dublin den ; and there , as Haman thought scorn to lay his hand on Mordecai , but extended his murderous purpose to all the people of the Jews ,— and as Nero wished that Rome had one neck , that he might destroy it at a blow ,— so Swift was stung by his personal disappointment to hurl out scorn at man and suspicion at his Maker . It was not , it must be noticed , the evil which was in man which excited his hatred and contempt ; it was man himself . He was not merely , as many are , disgusted with the selfish and malignant elements which are mingled in man 's nature and character , and disposed to trace them to any cause save a Divine will , but he believed man to be , as a whole , the work and child of the devil ; and he told the imaginary creator and creature to their face , what he thought the truth ,— ‘ The devil is an ass . ’ His was the very madness of Manichaeism . That heresy held that the devil was one of two aboriginal creative powers , but Swift seemed to believe at times that he was the only God . From a Yahoo man , it was difficult to avoid the inference of a demon deity . It is very laughable to find writers in Blackwood and elsewhere striving to prove Swift a Christian , as if , whatever were his professions , and however sincere he might be often in these , the whole tendency of his writings , his perpetual and unlimited abuse of man 's body and soul , his denial of every human virtue , the filth he pours upon every phase of human nature , and the doctrine he insinuates — that man has fallen indeed , but fallen , not from the angel , but from the animal , or , rather , is just a bungled brute ,— were not enough to shew that either his notions were grossly erroneous and perverted , or that he himself deserved , like another Nebuchadnezzar , to be driven from men , and to have a beast 's heart given unto him . Sometimes he reminds us of an impure angel , who has surprised man naked and asleep , looked at him with microscopic eyes , ignored all his peculiar marks of fallen dignity and incipient godhood , and in heartless rhymes reported accordingly .</p>
   <p>Swift belonged to the same school as Pope , although the feminine element which was in the latter modified and mellowed his feelings . Pope was a more successful and a happier man than Swift . He was much smaller , too , in soul as well as in body , and his gall-organ was proportionably less . Pope 's feeling to humanity was a tiny malice ; Swift 's became , at length , a black malignity . Pope always reminds us of an injured and pouting hero of Lilliput , ‘ doing well to be angry ’ under the gourd of a pocket-flap , or squealing out his griefs from the centre of an empty snuff-box ; Swift is a man , nay , monster of misanthropy . In minute and microscopic vision of human infirmities , Pope excels even Swift ; but then you always conceive Swift leaning down a giant , though gnarled , stature to behold them , while Pope is on their level , and has only to look straight before him . Pope 's wrath is always measured ; Swift 's , as in the ‘ Legion-Club ’ is a whirlwind of ‘ black fire and horror , ’ in the breath of which no flesh can live , and against which genius and virtue themselves furnish no shield .</p>
   <p>After all , Swift might , perhaps , have put in the plea of Byron —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ All my faults perchance thou knowest ,</l>
     <l n="2">All my madness none can know . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>There was a black spot of madness in his brain , and another black spot in his heart ; and the two at last met , and closed up his destiny in night . Let human nature forgive its most determined and systematic reviler , for the sake of the wretchedness in which he was involved all his life long . He was born ( in 1667 ) a posthumous child ; he was brought up an object of charity ; he spent much of his youth in dependence ; he had to leave his Irish college without a degree ; he was flattered with hopes from King William and the Whigs , which were not fulfilled ; he was condemned to spend a great part of his life in Ireland , a country he detested ; he was involved — partly , no doubt , through his own blame — in a succession of fruitless and miserable intrigues , alike of love and politics ; he was soured by want of success in England , and spoiled by enormous popularity in Ireland ; he was tried by a kind of religious doubts , which would not go out to prayer or fasting ; he was haunted by the fear of the dreadful calamity which at last befell him ; his senses and his soul left him one by one ; he became first giddy , then deaf , and then mad ; his madness was of the most terrible sort — it was a ‘ silent rage ; ’ for a year or two he lay dumb ; and at last , on the 19th of October 1745 ,</p>
   <p>‘ Swift expired , a driveller and a show , ’</p>
   <p>leaving his money to found a lunatic asylum , and his works as a many - volumed legacy of curse to mankind .</p>
   <note>Note : It has been asserted that there were circumstances in extenuation of Swift 's conduct , particularly in reference to the ladies whose names were connected with his , which cannot be publicly brought forward .</note>

   <p>ISAAC WATTS .</p>
   <p>We feel relieved , and so doubtless do our readers , in passing from the dark tragic story of Swift , and his dubious and unhappy character , to contemplate the useful career of a much smaller , but a much better man , Isaac Watts . This admirable person was born at Southampton on the 17th of July 1674 . His father , of the same name , kept a boarding-school for young gentlemen , and was a man of intelligence and piety . Isaac was the eldest of nine children , and began early to display precocity of genius . At four he commenced to study Latin at home , and afterwards , under one Pinhorn , a clergyman , who kept the free-school at Southampton , he learned Latin , Hebrew , and Greek . A subscription was proposed for sending him to one of the great universities , but he preferred casting in his lot with the Dissenters . He repaired accordingly , in 1690 , to an academy kept by the Rev . Thomas Rowe , whose son , we believe , became the husband of the celebrated Elizabeth Rowe , the once popular author of ‘ Letters from the Dead to the Living . ’ The Rowes belonged to the Independent body . At this academy Watts began to write poetry , chiefly in the Latin language , and in the then popular Pindaric measure . At the age of twenty , he returned to his father 's house , and spent two quiet years in devotion , meditation , and study . He became next a tutor in the family of Sir John Hartopp for five years . He was afterwards chosen assistant to Dr Chauncey , and , after the Doctor 's death , became his successor . His health , however , failed , and , after getting an assistant for a while , he was compelled to resign . In 1712 , Sir Thomas Abney , a benevolent gentleman of the neighbourhood , received Watts into his house , where he continued during the rest of his life — all his wants attended to , and his feeble frame so tenderly cared for that he lived to the age of seventy-five . Sir Thomas died eight years after Dr Watts entered his establishment , but the widow and daughters continued unwearied in their attentions . Abney House was a mansion surrounded by fine gardens and pleasure-grounds , where the Doctor became thoroughly at home , and was wont to refresh his body and mind in the intervals of study . He preached regularly to a congregation , and in the pulpit , although his stature was low , not exceeding five feet , the excellence of his matter , the easy flow of his language , and the propriety of his pronunciation , rendered him very popular . In private he was exceedingly kind to the poor and to children , giving to the former a third part of his small income of £ 100 a-year , and writing for the other his inimitable hymns . Besides these , he published a well-known treatise on Logic , another on ‘ The Improvement of the Mind , ’ besides various theological productions , amongst which his ‘ World to Come ’ has been preeminently popular . In 1728 , he received from Edinburgh and Aberdeen an unsolicited diploma of Doctor of Divinity . As age advanced , he found himself unable to discharge his ministerial duties , and offered to remit his salary , but his congregation refused to accept his demission . On the 25th November 1748 , quite worn out , but without suffering , this able and worthy man expired .</p>
   <p>If to be eminently useful is to fulfil the highest purpose of humanity , it was certainly fulfilled by Isaac Watts . His logical and other treatises have served to brace the intellects , methodise the studies , and concentrate the activities of thousands — we had nearly said of millions of minds . This has given him an enviable distinction , but he shone still more in that other province he so felicitously chose and so successfully occupied — that of the hearts of the young . One of his detractors called him ‘ Mother Watts . ’ He might have taken up this epithet , and bound it as a crown unto him . We have heard of a pious foreigner , possessed of imperfect English , who , in an agony of supplication to God for some sick friend , said , ‘ O Fader , hear me ! O Mudder , hear me ! ’ It struck us as one of the finest of stories , and containing one of the most beautiful tributes to the Deity we ever heard , recognising in Him a pity which not even a father , which only a mother can feel . Like a tender mother does good Watts bend over the little children , and secure that their first words of song shall be those of simple , heartfelt trust in God , and of faith in their Elder Brother . To create a little heaven in the nursery by hymns , and these not mawkish or twaddling , but beautifully natural and exquisitely simple breathings of piety and praise , was the high task to which Watts consecrated , and by which he has immortalised , his genius .</p>

   <p>AMBROSE PHILIPS .</p>
   <p>This gentleman — remembered now chiefly as Pope 's temporary rival — was born in 1671 , in Leicestershire ; studied at Cambridge ; and , being a great Whig , was appointed by the government of George I. to be Commissioner of the Collieries , and afterwards to some lucrative appointments in Ireland . He was also made one of the Commissioners of the Lottery . He was elected member for Armagh in the Irish House of Commons . He returned home in 1748 , and died the next year in his lodgings at Vauxhall .</p>
   <p>His works are ‘ The Distressed Mother , ’ a tragedy translated from Racine , and greatly praised in the Spectator ; two deservedly forgotten plays , ‘ The Briton , ’ and ‘ Humphrey , Duke of Gloucester ; ’ some miscellaneous pieces , of which an epistle to the Earl of Dorset , dated Copenhagen , has some very vivid lines ; his Pastorals , which were commended by Tickell at the expense of those of Pope , who took his revenge by damning them , not with ‘ faint ’ but with fulsome and ironical praise , in the Guardian ; and the subjoined fragment from Sappho , which is , particularly in the first stanza , melody itself . Some conjecture that it was touched up by Addison .</p>

   <p>WILLIAM HAMILTON .</p>
   <p>William Hamilton , of Bangour , was born in Ayrshire in 1704 . He was of an ancient family , and mingled from the first in the most fashionable circles . Ere he was twenty he wrote verses in Ramsay 's ‘ Tea-Table Miscellany . ’ In 1745 , to the surprise of many , he joined the standard of Prince Charles , and wrote a poem on the battle of Gladsmuir , or Prestonpans . When the reverse of his party came , after many wanderings and hair'shYpppHeNbreadth escapes in the Highlands , he found refuge in France . As he was a general favourite , and as much allowance was made for his poetical temperament , a pardon was soon procured for him by his friends , and he returned to his native country . His health , however , originally delicate , had suffered by his Highland privations , and he was compelled to seek the milder clime of Lyons , where he died in 1754 .</p>
   <p>Hamilton was what is called a ladies ’ - man , but his attachments were not deep , and he rather flirted than loved . A Scotch lady , who was annoyed at his addresses , asked John Home how she could get rid of them . He , knowing Hamilton well , advised her to appear to favour him . She acted on the advice , and he immediately withdrew his suit . And yet his best poem is a tale of love , and a tale , too , told with great simplicity and pathos . We refer to his ‘ Braes of Yarrow , ’ the beauty of which we never felt fully till we saw some time ago that lovely region , with its ‘ dowie dens , ’ — its clear living stream ,— Newark Castle , with its woods and memories ,— and the green wildernesses of silent hills which stretch on all sides around ; saw it , too , in that aspect of which Wordsworth sung in the words —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ The grace of forest charms decayed</l>
     <l n="2">And pastoral melancholy . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It is the highest praise we can bestow upon Hamilton 's ballad that it ranks in merit near Wordsworth 's fine trinity of poems , ‘ Yarrow Unvisited , ’ ‘ Yarrow Visited , ’ and ‘ Yarrow Revisited . ’</p>

   <p>ALLAN RAMSAY .</p>
   <p>Crawford Muir , in Lanarkshire , was the birthplace of this true poet . His father was manager of the Earl of Hopetoun 's lead-mines . Allan was born in 1686 . His mother was Alice Bower , the daughter of an Englishman who had emigrated from Derbyshire . His father died while his son was yet in infancy ; his mother married again in the same district ; and young Allan was educated at the parish school of Leadhills . At the age of fifteen , he was sent to Edinburgh , and bound apprentice to a wig-maker there . This trade , however , he left after finishing his term . He displayed rather early a passion for literature , and made a little reputation by some pieces of verse ,— such as ‘ An Address to the Easy Club , ’ a convivial society with which he was connected ,— and a considerable time after by a capital continuation of King James ’ ‘ Christis Kirk on the Green . ’ In 1712 , he married a writer 's daughter , Christiana Ross , who was his affectionate companion for thirty years . Soon after , he set up a bookseller 's shop opposite Niddry 's Wynd , and in this capacity edited and published two collections ,— the one of songs , some of them his own , entitled ‘ The Tea-Table Miscellany , ’ and the other of early Scottish poems , entitled ‘ The Evergreen . ’ In 1725 , he published ‘ The Gentle Shepherd . ’ It was the expansion of one or two pastoral scenes which he ad shewn to his delighted friends . The poem became instantly popular , and was republished in London and Dublin , and widely circulated in the colonies . Pope admired it . Gay , then in Scotland with his patrons the Queensberry family , used to lounge into Ramsay 's shop to get explanations of its Scotch phrases to transmit to Twickenham , and to watch from the window the notable characters whom Allan pointed out to him in the Edinburgh Exchange . He now removed to a better shop , and set up for his sign the heads of Ben Jonson and Drummond , who agreed better in figure than they had done in reality at Hawthornden . He established the first circulating library in Scotland . His shop became a centre of intelligence , and Ramsay sat a Triton among the minnows of that rather mediocre day — giving his little senate laws , and inditing verses , songs , and fables . At forty-five — an age when Sir Walter Scott had scarcely commenced his Waverley novels , and Dryden had by far his greatest works to produce — honest Allan imagined his vein exhausted , and ceased to write , although he lived and enjoyed life for nearly thirty years more . At last , after having lost money and gained obloquy , in a vain attempt to found the first theatre in Edinburgh , and after building for himself a curious octagon-shaped house on the north side of the Castle Hill , which , while he called it Ramsay Lodge , his enemies nicknamed ‘ The Goose-pie , ’ and which , though altered , still , we believe , stands , under the name of Ramsay Garden , the author of ‘ The Gentle Shepherd ’ breathed his last on the 7th of January 1758 . He died of a scurvy in the gums . His son became a distinguished painter , intimate with Johnson , Burke , and the rest of that splendid set , although now chiefly remembered from his connexion with them and with his father .</p>
   <p>Allan Ramsay was a poet with very few of the usual poetical faults . He had an eye for nature , but he had also an eye for the main chance . He ‘ kept his shop , and his shop kept him . ’ He might sing of intrigues , and revels , and houses of indifferent reputation ; but he was himself a quiet , canny , domestic man , seen regularly at kirk and market . He had a great reverence for the gentry , with whom he fancied himself , and perhaps was , through the Dalhousie family , connected . He had a vast opinion of himself ; and between pride of blood , pride of genius , and plenty of means , he was tolerably happy . How different from poor maudlin Fergusson , or from that dark-browed , dark-eyed , impetuous being who was , within a year of Ramsay 's death , to appear upon the banks of Doon , coming into the world to sing divinely , to act insanely , and prematurely to die !</p>
   <p>A bard , in the highest use of the word , in which it approaches the meaning of prophet , Ramsay was not , else he would not have ceased so soon to sing . Whatever lyrical impulse was in him speedily wore itself out , and left him to his milder mission as a broad reflector of Scottish life — in its humbler , gentler , and better aspects . His ‘ Gentle Shepherd ’ is a chapter of Scottish still-life ; and , since the pastoral is essentially the poetry of peace , the ‘ Gentle Shepherd ’ is the finest pastoral in the world . No thunders roll among these solitary crags ; no lightnings affright these lasses among their claes at Habbie 's Howe ; the air is still and soft ; the plaintive bleating of the sheep upon the hills , the echoes of the city are distant and faintly heard , so that the very sounds seem in unison and in league with silence . One thinks of Shelley 's isle ‘ mid the Aegean deep :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ It is an isle under Ionian skies ,</l>
     <l n="2">Beautiful as the wreck of Paradise ;</l>
     <l n="3">And for the harbours are not safe and good ,</l>
     <l n="4">The land would have remained a solitude ,</l>
     <l n="5">But for some pastoral people , native there ,</l>
     <l n="6">Who from the Elysian clear and sunny air</l>
     <l n="7">Draw the last spirit of the age of gold ,</l>
     <l n="8">Simple and generous , innocent and bold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">The winged storms , chanting their thunder psalm</l>
     <l n="10">To other lands , leave azure chasms of calm</l>
     <l n="11">Over this isle , or weep themselves in dew ,</l>
     <l n="12">From whence the fields and woods ever renew</l>
     <l n="13">Their green and golden immortality . ’</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Yet in the little circle of calm carved out by the magician of ‘ The Gentle Shepherd ’ there is no insipidity . Lust is sternly excluded , but love of the purest and warmest kind there breathes . The parade of learning is not there ; but strong common sense thinks , and robust and manly eloquence declaims . Humour too is there , and many have laughed at Mause and Baldy , whom all the frigid wit of ‘ Love for Love ’ and the ‘ School for Scandal ’ could only move to contempt or pity . A dénouement of great skill is not wanting to stir the calm surface of the story by the wind of surprise ; the curtain falls over a group of innocent , guileless , and happy hearts , and as we gaze at them we breathe the prayer , that Scotland 's peerage and Scotland 's peasantry may always thus be blended into one bond of mutual esteem , endearment , and excellence . Well might Campbell say — ‘ Like the poetry of Tasso and Ariosto , that of the “ Gentle Shepherd ” is engraven on the memory of its native country . Its verses have passed into proverbs , and it continues to be the delight and solace of the peasantry whom it describes . ’</p>
   <p>Ramsay has very slightly touched on the religion of his countrymen . This is to be regretted ; but if he had no sympathy with that , he , at least , disdained to counterfeit it , and its poetical aspects have since been adequately sung by other minstrels .</p>

   <p>Oldys was born in 1696 , and died in 1761 . He was a very diligent collector of antiquarian materials , and the author of a Life of Raleigh . He was intimate with Captain Grose , Burns ’ friend , who used to rally him on his inordinate thirst for ale , although , if we believe Burns , it was paralleled by Grose 's liking for port . The following Anacreontic is characteristic :—</p>

   <p>ROBERT LLOYD .</p>
   <p>Robert Lloyd was born in London in 1733 . He was the son of one of the under-masters of Westminster School . He went to Cambridge , where he became distinguished for his talents and notorious for his dissipation . He became an usher under his father , but soon tired of the drudgery , and commenced professional author . He published a poem called ‘ The Actor , ’ which attracted attention , and was the precursor of ‘ The Rosciad . ’ He wrote for periodicals , produced some theatrical pieces of no great merit , and edited the St James ’ Magazine . This failed , and Lloyd , involved in pecuniary distresses , was cast into the Fleet . Here he was deserted by all his boon companions except Churchill , to whose sister he was attached , and who allowed him a guinea a-week and a servant , besides promoting a subscription for his benefit . When the news of Churchill 's death arrived , Lloyd was seated at dinner ; he became instantly sick , cried out ‘ Poor Charles ! I shall follow him soon , ’ and died in a few weeks . Churchill 's sister , a woman of excellent abilities , waited on Lloyd during his illness , and died soon after him of a broken heart . This was in 1764 .</p>
   <p>Lloyd was a minor Churchill . He had not his brawny force , but he had more than his liveliness of wit , and was a much better-conditioned man , and more temperate in his satire . Cowper knew , loved , admired , and in some of his verses imitated , Robert Lloyd .</p>

   <p>DAVID MALLETT .</p>
   <p>David Mallett was the son of a small innkeeper in Crieff , Perthshire , where he was born in the year 1700 . Crieff , as many of our readers know , is situated on the western side of a hill , and commands a most varied and beautiful prospect , including Drummond Castle , with its solemn shadowy woods , and the Ochils , on the south ,— Ochtertyre , one of the loveliest spots in Scotland , and the gorge of Glenturrett , on the north ,— and the bold dark hills which surround the romantic village of Comrie , on the west . Crieff is now a place of considerable note , and forms a centre of summer attraction to multitudes ; but at the commencement of the eighteenth century it must have been a miserable hamlet . Malloch was originally the name of the poet , and the name is still common in that part of Perthshire . David attended the college of Aberdeen , and became , afterwards , an unsalaried tutor in the family of Mr Home of Dreghorn , near Edinburgh . We find him next in the Duke of Montrose 's family , with a salary of £ 30 per annum . In 1723 , he accompanied his pupils to London , and changed his name to Mallett , as more euphonious . Next year , he produced his pretty ballad of ‘ William and Margaret , ’ and published it in Aaron Hill 's ‘ Plain Dealer . ’ This served as an introduction to the literary society of the metropolis , including such names as Young and Pope . In 1733 , he disgraced himself by a satire on the greatest man then living , the venerable Richard Bentley . Mallett was one of those mean creatures who always worship a rising , and turn their backs on a setting sun . By his very considerable talents , his management , and his address , he soon rose in the world . He was appointed under-secretary to the Prince of Wales , with a salary of £ 200 a-year . In conjunction with Thomson , to whom he was really kind , he wrote in 1740 , ‘ The Masque of Alfred , ’ in honour of the birthday of the Princess Augusta . His first wife , of whom nothing is recorded , having died , he married the daughter of Lord Carlisle 's steward , who brought him a fortune of £ 10 , 000 . Both she and Mallett himself gave themselves out as Deists . This was partly owing to his intimacy with Bolingbroke , to gratify whom , he heaped abuse upon Pope in a preface to ‘ The Patriot-King , ’ and was rewarded by Bolingbroke leaving him the whole of his works and MSS . These he afterwards published , and exposed himself to the vengeful sarcasm of Johnson , who said that Bolingbroke was a scoundrel and a coward ;— a scoundrel , to charge a blunderbuss against Christianity ; and a coward , because he durst not fire it himself , but left a shilling to a beggarly Scotsman to draw the trigger after his death . Mallett ranked himself among the calumniators and , as it proved , murderers of Admiral Byng . He wrote a Life of Lord Bacon , in which , it was said , he forgot that Bacon was a philosopher , and would probably , when he came to write the Life of Marlborough , forget that he was a general . This Life of Bacon is now utterly forgotten . We happened to read it in our early days , and thought it a very contemptible performance . The Duchess of Marlborough left £ 1000 in her will between Glover and Mallett to write a Life of her husband . Glover threw up his share of the work , and Mallett engaged to perform the whole , to which , besides , he was stimulated by a pension from the second Duke of Marlborough . He got the money , but when he died it was found that he had not written a line of the work . In his latter days he held the lucrative office of Keeper of the Book of Entries for the port of London . He died on the 2lst April 1765 .</p>
   <p>Mallett is , on the whole , no credit to Scotland . He was a bad , mean , insincere , and unprincipled man , whose success was procured by despicable and dastardly arts . He had doubtless some genius , and his ‘ Birks of Invermay , ’ and ‘ William and Margaret , ’ shall preserve his name after his clumsy imitation of Thomson , called ‘ The Excursion , ’ and his long , rambling ‘ Amyntor and Theodora ; ’ have been forgotten .</p>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>DR JAMES GRAINGER .</head>
    <head>This writer possessed some true imagination , although his claim to immortality lies in the narrow compass of one poem — his ‘ Ode to Solitude . ’ Little is known of his personal history . He was born in 1721 — belonging to a gentleman 's family in Cumberland . He studied medicine , and was for some time a surgeon connected with the army . When the peace came , he established himself in London as a medical practitioner . In 1755 , he published his ‘ Solitude , ’ which found many admirers , including Dr Johnson , who pronounced its opening lines ‘ very noble . ’ He afterwards indited several other pieces , wrote a translation of Tibullus , and became one of the critical staff of the Monthly Review . He was unable , however , through all these labours to secure a competence , and , in 1759 , he sought the West Indies . In St Christopher 's he commenced practising as a physician , and married the Governor 's daughter , who brought him a fortune . He wrote a poem entitled ‘ The Sugar-cane . ’ This was sent over to London in MS ., and was read at Sir Joshua Reynold 's table to a literary coterie , who , according to Boswell , all burst out into a laugh when , after much blank-verse pomp , the poet began a new paragraph thus —</head>
     <l n="1">‘ Now , Muse , let 's sing of rats !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And what increased the ridicule was , that one of the company , slily overlooking the reader , found that the word had been originally ‘ mice , ’ but had been changed to rats as more dignified .</p>
   <p>Boswell goes on to record Johnson 's opinion of Grainger . He said , ‘ He was an agreeable man , a man that would do any good that was in his power . ’ His translation of Tibullus was very well done , but ‘ The Sugar - cane , a Poem , ’ did not please him . ‘ What could he make of a Sugar-cane ? one might as well write “ The Parsley-bed , a Poem , ” or “ The Cabbage Garden , a Poem . " ’ Boswell — ‘ You must then pickle your cabbage with the sal Atticum . ’ Johnson — ‘ One could say a great deal about cabbage . The poem might begin with the advantages of civilised society over a rude state , exemplified by the Scotch , who had no cabbages till Oliver Cromwell 's soldiers introduced them , and one might thus shew how arts are propagated by conquest , as they were by the Roman arms . ’ Cabbage , by the way , in a metaphorical sense , might furnish a very good subject for a literary satire .</p>
   <p>Grainger died of the fever of the country in 1767 . Bishop Percy corroborates Johnson 's character of him as a man . He says , ‘ He was not only a man of genius and learning , but had many excellent virtues , being one of the most generous , friendly , benevolent men I ever knew . ’</p>
   <p>Grainger in some points reminds us of Dyer . Dyer staked his reputation on ‘ The Fleece ; ’ but it is his lesser poem , ‘ Grongar Hill , ’ which preserves his name ; that fine effusion has survived the laboured work . And so Grainger 's ‘ Solitude ’ has supplanted the stately ‘ Sugar-cane . ’ The scenery of the West Indies had to wait till its real poet appeared in the author of ‘ Paul and Virginia . ’ Grainger was hardly able to cope with the strange and gorgeous contrasts it presents of cliffs and crags , like those of Iceland , with vegetation rich as that of the fairest parts of India , and of splendid sunshine , with tempests of such tremendous fury that , but for their brief continuance , no property could be secure , and no life could be safe .</p>
   <p>The commencement of the ‘ Ode to Solitude ’ is fine , but the closing part becomes tedious . In the middle of the poem there is a tumult of personifications , some of them felicitous and others forced .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Sage Reflection , bent with years , ’</l>
     <l n="2">may pass , but</l>
     <l n="3">‘ Conscious Virtue , void of fears , ’</l>
     <l n="4">is poor .</l>
     <l n="5">‘ Halcyon Peace on moss reclined , ’</l>
     <l n="6">is a picture ;</l>
     <l n="7">‘ Retrospect that scans the mind , ’</l>
     <l n="8">is nothing ;</l>
     <l n="9">‘ Health that snuffs the morning air , ’</l>
     <l n="10">is a living image ; but what sense is there in</l>
     <l n="11">‘ Full-eyed Truth , with bosom bare ? ’</l>
     <l n="12">and how poor his</l>
     <l n="13">‘ Laughter in loud peals that breaks , ’</l>
     <l n="14">to Milton 's</l>
     <l n="15">‘ Laughter , holding both his sides ! ’</l>
     <l n="16">The paragraph , however , commencing</l>
     <l n="17">‘ With you roses brighter bloom , ’</l>
     <l n="18">and closing with</l>
     <l n="19">‘ The bournless macrocosm 's thine , ’</l>
     <l n="20">is very spirited , and , along with the opening lines , proves</l>
     <l n="21">Grainger a poet .</l>

   <p>MICHAEL BRUCE .</p>
   <p>We refer our readers to Dr Mackelvie 's well-known and very able Life of poor Bruce , for his full story , and for the evidence on which his claim to the ‘ Cuckoo ’ is rested . Apart from external evidence , we think that poem more characteristic of Bruce 's genius than of Logan 's , and have therefore ranked it under Bruce 's name .</p>
   <p>Bruce was born on the 27th of March 1746 , at Kinnesswood , parish of Portmoak , county of Kinross . His father was a weaver , and Michael was the fifth of a family of eight children .</p>
   <p>Poor as his parents were , they were intelligent , religious , and most conscientious in the discharge of their duties to their children . In the summer months Michael was sent out to herd cattle ; and one loves to imagine the young poet wrapt in his plaid , under a whin-bush , while the storm was blowing ,— or gazing at the rainbow from the summit of a fence ,— or admiring at Lochleven and its old ruined castle ,— or weaving around the form of some little maiden , herding in a neighbouring field — some ‘ Jeanie Morrison ’ — one of those webs of romantic early love which are beautiful and evanescent as the gossamer , but how exquisitely relished while they last ! Say not , with one of his biographers , that his ‘ education was retarded by this employment ; ’ he was receiving in these solitary fields a kind of education which no school and no college could furnish ; nay , who knows but , as he saw the cuckoo winging her way from one deep woodland recess to another , or heard her dull , divine monotone coming from the heart of the forest , the germ of that exquisite strain , ‘ least in the kingdom ’ of the heaven of poetry in size , but immortal in its smallness , was sown in his mind ? In winter he went to school , and profited there so much , that at fifteen ( not a very early period , after all , for a Scotch student beginning his curriculum — in our day twelve was not an uncommon age ) he was judged fit for going to college . And just in time a windfall came across the path of our poet , the mention of which may make many of our readers smile . This was a legacy which was left his father by a relative , amounting to 200 merks , or £ 11 , 2s. 6d . With this munificent sum in his pocket , Bruce was sent to study at Edinburgh College . Here he became distinguished by his attainments , and particularly his taste and poetic powers ; and here , too , he became acquainted with John Logan , afterwards his biographer . After spending three sessions at college , supported by his parents and other friends , he returned to the country , and taught a school at Gairney Bridge ( a place famous for the first meeting of the first presbytery of the Seceders ) for £ 11 of salary . Thence he removed to Foresthill , near Alloa , where a damp school-room , poverty , and hard labour in teaching , united to injure his health and depress his spirits . At Foresthill he wrote his poem ‘ Lochleven , ’ which discovers no small descriptive power . Consumption began now to make its appearance , and he returned to the cottage of his parents , where he wrote his ‘ Elegy on Spring , ’ in which he refers with dignified pathos to his approaching dissolution . On the 5th of July 1767 , this remarkable youth died , aged twenty-one years and three months . His Bible was found on his pillow , marked at the words , Jer . xxii . 10 , ‘ Weep ye not for the dead , neither bemoan him : but weep sore for him that goeth away : for he shall return no more , nor see his native country . ’</p>
   <p>Lord Craig wrote some time afterwards an affecting paper in the Mirror , recording the fate , and commending the genius of Bruce . John Logan , in 1770 , published his poems . In the year 1807 , the kind-hearted Principal Baird published an edition of the poems for the behoof of Bruce 's mother , then an aged widow . And in 1837 , Dr William Mackelvie , Balgedie , Kinross - shire , published what may be considered the standard Life of this poet , along with a complete edition of his Works .</p>
   <p>It is impossible from so small a segment of a circle as Bruce 's life describes , to infer with any certainty the whole . So far as we can judge from the fragments left , his power was rather in the beautiful , than in the sublime or in the strong . The lines on Spring , from the words ‘ Now spring returns ’ to the close , form a continuous stream of pensive loveliness . How sweetly he sings in the shadow of death ! Nor let us too severely blame his allusion to the old Pagan mythology , in the words —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ I hear the helpless wail , the shriek of woe ,</l>
     <l n="2">I see the muddy wave , the dreary shore ; ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>remembering that he was still a mere student , and not recovered from that fine intoxication in which classical literature drenches a young imaginative soul , and that at last we find him ‘ resting in the hopes of an eternal day . ’ ‘ Lochleven ’ is the spent echo of the ‘ Seasons , ’ although , as we said before , its descriptions possess considerable merit . His ‘ Last Day ’ is more ambitious than successful . If we grant the ‘ Cuckoo ’ to be his , as we are inclined decidedly to do , it is a sure title to fame , being one of the sweetest little poems in any language . Shakspeare would have been proud of the verse —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Sweet bird ! thy bower is ever green ,</l>
     <l n="2">Thy sky is ever clear ;</l>
     <l n="3">Thou hast no sorrow in thy song ,</l>
     <l n="4">No winter in thy year . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Bruce has not , however , it has always appeared to us , caught so well as Wordsworth the differentia of the cuckoo ,— its invisible , shadowy , shifting , supernatural character — heard , but seldom seen — its note so limited and almost unearthly :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ O Cuckoo , shall I call thee bird ,</l>
     <l n="2">Or but a wandering voice ? ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>How fine this conception of a separated voice — ‘ The viewless spirit of a lonely sound , ’ plaining in the woods as if seeking for some incarnation it cannot find , and saddening the spring groves by a note so contradictory to the genius of the season . In reference to the note of the cuckoo we find the following remarks among the fragments from the commonplace-book of Dr Thomas Brown , printed by Dr Welsh :— ‘ The name of the cuckoo has generally been considered as a very pure instance of imitative harmony . But in giving that name , we have most unjustly defrauded the poor bird of a portion of its very small variety of sound . The second syllable is not a mere echo of the first ; it is the sound reversed , like the reading of a sotadic line ; and to preserve the strictness of the imitation we should give it the name of Ook-koo . ’ This is the prose of the cuckoo after its poetry .</p>

   <p>CHRISTOPHER SMART .</p>
   <p>We hear of ‘ Single-speech Hamilton . ’ We have now to say something of ‘ Single-poem Smart , ’ the author of one of the grandest bursts of devotional and poetical feeling in the English language — the ‘ Song to David . ’ This poor unfortunate was born at Shipbourne , Kent , in 1722 . His father was steward to Lord Barnard , who , after his death , continued his patronage to the son , who was then eleven years of age . The Duchess of Cleveland , through Lord Barnard 's influence , bestowed on Christopher an allowance of £ 40 a-year . With this he went to Pembroke Hall , Cam - bridge , in 1739 ; was in 1745 elected a Fellow of Pembroke , and in 1747 took his degree of M. A . At college , Smart began to display that reckless dissipation which led afterwards to such melancholy consequences . He studied hard , however , at intervals ; wrote poetry both in Latin and English ; produced a comedy called a ‘ Trip to Cambridge ; or , The Grateful Fair , ’ which was acted in the hall of Pembroke College ; and , in spite of his vices and follies , was popular on account of his agreeable manners and amiable dispositions . Having become acquainted with Newberry , the benevolent , red-nosed bookseller commemorated in ‘ The Vicar of Wakefield , ’ — for whom he wrote some trifles ,— he married his step - daughter , Miss Carnan , in the year 1753 . He now removed to London , and became an author to trade . He wrote a clever satire , entitled ‘ The Hilliad , ’ against Sir John Hill , who had attacked him in an underhand manner . He translated the fables of Phaedrus into verse ,— Horace into prose ( ‘ Smart 's Horace ’ used to be a great favourite , under the rose , with schoolboys ) ; made an indifferent version of the Psalms and Paraphrases , and a good one , at a former period , of Pope 's ‘ Ode on St Cecilia 's Day , ’ with which that poet professed himself highly pleased . He was employed on a monthly publication called The Universal Visitor . We find Johnson giving the following account of this matter in Boswell 's Life :— ‘ Old Gardner , the bookseller , employed Rolt and Smart to write a monthly miscellany called The Universal Visitor . ’ There was a formal written contract . They were bound to write nothing else ,— they were to have , I think , a third of the profits of the sixpenny pamphlet , and the contract was for ninety-nine years . I wrote for some months in The Universal Visitor for poor Smart , while he was mad , not then knowing the terms on which he was engaged to write , and thinking I was doing him good . I hoped his wits would soon return to him . Mine returned to me , and I wrote in The Universal Visitor no longer . ’</p>
   <p>Smart at last was called to pay the penalty of his blended labour and dissipation . In 1763 he was shut up in a madhouse . His derangement had exhibited itself in a religious way : he insisted upon people kneeling down along with him in the street and praying . During his confinement , writing materials were denied him , and he used to write his poetical pieces with a key on the wainscot . Thus , ‘ scrabbling , ’ like his own hero , on the wall , he produced his immortal ‘ Song to David . ’ He became by and by sane ; but , returning to his old habits , got into debt , and died in the King 's Bench prison , after a short illness , in 1770 .</p>
   <p>The ‘ Song to David ’ has been well called one of the greatest curiosities of literature . It ranks in this point with the tragedies written by Lee , and the sermons and prayers uttered by Hall in a similar melancholy state of mind . In these cases , as well as in Smart 's , the thin partition between genius and madness was broken down in thunder ,— the thunder of a higher poetry than perhaps they were capable of even conceiving in their saner moments . Lee produced in that state — which was , indeed , nearly his normal one — some glorious extravagancies . Hall 's sermons , monologised and overheard in the madhouse , are said to have transcended all that he preached in his healthier moods . And , assuredly , the other poems by Smart scarcely furnish a point of comparison with the towering and sustained loftiness of some parts of the ‘ Song to David . ’ Nor is it loftiness alone ,— although the last three stanzas are absolute inspiration , and you see the waters of Castalia tossed by a heavenly wind to the very summit of Parnassus ,— but there are innumerable exquisite beauties and subtleties , dropt as if by the hand of rich haste , in every corner of the poem . Witness his description of David 's muse , as a</p>

   <p>Incoherence and extravagance we find here and there ; but it is not the flutter of weakness , it is the fury of power : from the very stumble of the rushing steed , sparks are kindled . And , even as Baretti , when he read the Rambler , in Italy , thought within himself , If such are the lighter productions of the English mind , what must be the grander and sterner efforts of its genius ? and formed , consequently , a strong desire to visit that country ; so might he have reasoned , If such poems as ‘ David ’ issue from England 's very madhouses , what must be the writings of its saner and nobler poetic souls ? and thus might he , from the parallax of a Smart , have been able to rise toward the ideal altitudes of a Shakspeare or a Milton . Indeed , there are portions of the ‘ Song to David , ’ which a Milton or a Shakspeare has never surpassed . The blaze of the meteor often eclipses the light of</p>

   <p>THOMAS CHATTERTON .</p>
   <p>The history of this ‘ marvellous boy ’ is familiar to all the readers of English poetry , and requires only a cursory treatment here . Thomas Chatterton was born in Bristol , November 20 , 1752 . His father , a teacher in the free-school there , had died before his birth , and he was sent to be educated at a charity-school . He first learned to read from a black - letter Bible . At the age of fourteen , he was put apprentice to an attorney ; a situation which , however uncongenial , left him ample leisure for pursuing his private studies . In an unlucky hour , some evil genius seemed to have whispered to this extra-ordinary youth ,— ‘ Do not find or force , but forge thy way to renown ; the other paths to the summit of the hill are worn and common-place ; try a new and dangerous course , the rather as I forewarn thee that thy time is short . ’ When , accordingly , the new bridge at Bristol was finished in October 1768 , Chatterton sent to a newspaper a fictitious account of the opening of the old bridge , alleging in a note that he had found the principal part of the description in an ancient MS. And having thus fairly begun to work the mint of forgery , it was amazing what a number of false coins he threw off , and with what perfect ease and mastery ! Ancient poems , pretending to have been written four hundred and fifty years before ; fragments of sermons on the Holy Spirit , dated from the fifteenth century ; accounts of all the churches of Bristol as they had appeared three hundred years before ; with drawings and descriptions of the castle — most of them professing to be drawn from the writings of ‘ ane gode prieste , Thomas Rowley ’ — issued in thick succession from this wonderful , and , to use the Shakspearean word in a twofold sense , ‘ forgetive ’ brain . He next ventured to send to Horace Walpole , who was employed on a History of British Painters , an account of eminent ‘ Carvellers and Peyneters , ’ who , according to him , once flourished in Bristol . These labours he plied in secret , and with the utmost enthusiasm . He used to write by the light of the moon , deeming that there was a special inspiration in the rays of that planet , and reminding one of poor Nat Lee inditing his insane tragedies in his asylum under the same weird lustre . On Sabbaths he was wont to stroll away into the country around Bristol , which is very beautiful , and to draw sketches of those objects which impressed his imagination . He often lay down on the meadows near St Mary 's Redcliffe Church , admiring the ancient edifice ; and some years ago we saw a chamber near the summit of that edifice where he used to sit and write , his ‘ eye in a fine frenzy rolling , ’ and where we could imagine him , when a moonless night fell , composing his wild Runic lays by the light of a candle burning in a human skull . It was actually in one of the rooms of this church that some ancient chests had been deposited , including one called the ‘ Coffre of Mr Canynge , ’ an eminent merchant in Bristol , who had rebuilt the church in the reign of Edward IV . This coffer had been broken up by public authority in 1727 , and some valuable deeds had been taken out . Besides these , they contained various MSS ., some of which Chatterton 's father , whose uncle was sexton of the church , had carried off and used as covers to the copy-books of his scholars . This furnished a hint to Chatterton 's inventive genius . He gave out that among these parchments he had found many productions of Mr Canynge 's , and of the aforesaid Thomas Rowley 's , a priest of the fifteenth century , and a friend of Canynge 's . Chatterton had become a contributor to a periodical of the day called The Town and Country Magazine , and to it from time to time he sent these poems . A keen controversy arose as to their genuineness . Horace Walpole shewed some of them , which Chatterton had sent him , to Gray and Mason , who were deemed , justly , first-rate authorities on antiquarian matters , and who at once pronounced them forgeries . It is deeply to be regretted that these men , perceiving , as they must have done , the great merit of these productions , had not made more particular inquiries about them , and tried to help and save the poet . Walpole , to say the least of it , treated him coldly , telling him , when he had discovered the forgery , to attend to his own business , and keeping some of his MSS . in his hands , till an indignant letter from the author compelled him to restore them .</p>
   <p>Chatterton now determined to go to London . His three years ’ apprenticeship had expired , and there was in Bristol no further field for his aspiring genius . He found instant employment among the booksellers , and procured an introduction to Beckford , the patriot mayor , who tried to get him engaged upon the Opposition side in politics . Our capricious and unprincipled poet , however , declared that he was a poor author that could not write on both sides ; and although his leanings were to the popular party , yet on the death of Beckford he addressed a letter to Lord North in support of his administration . He had projected some large works , such as a History of England and a History of London , and wrote flaming letters to his mother and sisters about his prospects , enclosing them at the same time small remittances of money . But his bright hopes were soon overcast . Instead of a prominent political character , he found himself a mere bookseller 's hack . To this his poverty no more than his will would consent , for though that was great it was equalled by his pride . His life in the country had been regular , although his religious principles were loose ; but in town , misery drove him to intemperance , and intemperance , in its reaction , to remorse and a desperate tampering with the thought ,</p>
   <p>‘ There is one remedy for all . ’</p>
   <p>At last , after a vain attempt to obtain an appointment as a surgeon 's mate to Africa , he made up his mind to suicide . A guinea had been sent him by a gentleman , which he declined . Mrs Angel , his landlady , knowing him to be in want , the day before his death offered him his dinner , but this also he spurned ; and , on the 25th of August 1770 , having first destroyed all his papers , he swallowed arsenic , and was found dead in his bed .</p>

   <p>Chatterton , had he lived , would , perhaps , have become a powerful poet , or a powerful character of some kind . But we must now view him chiefly as a prodigy . Some have treated his power as unnatural — resembling a huge hydrocephalic head , the magnitude of which implies disease , ultimate weakness , and early death . Others maintain that , apart from the extraordinary elements that undoubtedly characterised Chatterton , and constituted him a premature and prodigious birth intellectually , there was also in parts of his poems evidence of a healthy vigour which only needed favourable circumstances to develop into transcendent excellence . Hazlitt , holding with the one of these opinions , cries , ‘ If Chatterton had had a great work to do by living , he would have lived ! ’ Others retort on the critic , ‘ On the same principle , why did Keats , whom you rate so high , perish so early ? ’ The question altogether is nugatory , seeing it can never be settled . Suffice it that these songs and rhymes of Chatterton have great beauties , apart from the age and position of their author . There may at times be madness , but there is method in it . The flight of the rhapsody is ever upheld by the strength of the wing , and while the reading discovered is enormous for a boy , the depth of feeling exhibited is equally extraordinary ; and the clear , firm judgment which did not characterise his conduct , forms the root and the trunk of much of his poetry . It was said of his eyes that it seemed as if fire rolled under them ; and it rolls still , and shall ever roll , below many of his verses .</p>

   <p>KENRICK .</p>
   <p>TRANSLATED FROM THE SAXON .</p>
   <p>When winter yelled through the leafless grove ; when the black waves rode over the roaring winds , and the dark-brown clouds hid the face of the sun ; when the silver brook stood still , and snow environed the top of the lofty mountain ; when the flowers appeared not in the blasted fields , and the boughs of the leafless trees bent with the loads of ice ; when the howling of the wolf affrighted the darkly glimmering light of the western sky ; Kenrick , terrible as the tempest , young as the snake of the valley , strong as the mountain of the slain ; his armour shining like the stars in the dark night , when the moon is veiled in sable , and the blasting winds howl over the wide plain ; his shield like the black rock , prepared himself for war .</p>
   <p>Ceolwolf of the high mountain , who viewed the first rays of the morning star , swift as the flying deer , strong as the young oak , fierce as an evening wolf , drew his sword ; glittering like the blue vapours in the valley of Horso ; terrible as the red lightning , bursting from the dark-brown clouds ; his swift bark rode over the foaming waves , like the wind in the tempest ; the arches fell at his blow , and he wrapped the towers in flames : he followed Kenrick , like a wolf roaming for prey .</p>
   <p>Centwin of the vale arose , he seized the massy spear ; terrible was his voice , great was his strength ; he hurled the rocks into the sea , and broke the strong oaks of the forest . Slow in the race as the minutes of impatience . His spear , like the fury of a thunderbolt , swept down whole armies ; his enemies melted before him , like the stones of hail at the approach of the sun .</p>
   <p>Awake , O Eldulph ! thou that sleepest on the white mountain , with the fairest of women . No more pursue the dark-brown wolf : arise from the mossy bank of the falling waters ; let thy garments be stained in blood , and the streams of life discolour thy girdle ; let thy flowing hair be hid in a helmet , and thy beauteous countenance be writhed into terror .</p>
   <p>Egward , keeper of the barks , arise like the roaring waves of the sea : pursue the black companies of the enemy .</p>
   <p>Ye Saxons , who live in the air and glide over the stars , act like yourselves .</p>
   <p>Like the murmuring voice of the Severn , swelled with rain , the Saxons moved along ; like a blazing star the sword of Kenrick shone among the Britons ; Tenyan bled at his feet ; like the red lightning of heaven he burnt up the ranks of his enemy .</p>
   <p>Centwin raged like a wild boar . Tatward sported in blood ; armies melted at his stroke . Eldulph was a flaming vapour ; destruction sat upon his sword . Ceolwolf was drenched in gore , but fell like a rock before the sword of Mervin .</p>
   <p>Egward pursued the slayer of his friend ; the blood of Mervin smoked on his hand .</p>
   <p>Like the rage of a tempest was the noise of the battle ; like the roaring of the torrent , gushing from the brow of the lofty mountain .</p>
   <p>The Britons fled , like a black cloud dropping hail , flying before the howling winds .</p>
   <p>Ye virgins ! arise and welcome back the pursuers ; deck their brows with chaplets of jewels ; spread the branches of the oak beneath their feet . Kenrick is returned from the war , the clotted gore hangs terrible upon his crooked sword , like the noxious vapours on the black rock ; his knees are red with the gore of the foe .</p>
   <p>Ye sons of the song , sound the instruments of music ; ye virgins , dance around him .</p>
   <p>Costan of the lake , arise , take thy harp from the willow , sing the praise of Kenrick , to the sweet sound of the white waves sinking to the foundation of the black rock .</p>
   <p>Rejoice , O ye Saxons ! Kenrick is victorious .</p>

    <head>LORD LYTTELTON .</head>
    <head>Dr Johnson said once of Chesterfield , ‘ I thought him a lord among wits , but I find him to be only a wit among lords . ’ And so we may say of Lord Lyttelton , ‘ He is a poet among lords , if not a lord among poets . ’ He was the son of Sir Thomas Lyttelton , of Hagley in Worcestershire , and was born in 1709 . He went to Eton and Oxford , where he distinguished himself . Having gone the usual grand tour , he entered Parliament , and became an opponent of Sir Robert Walpole . He was made secretary to the Prince of Wales , and was in this capacity useful to Mallett and Thomson . In 1741 , he married Lucy Fortescue , of Devonshire , who died five years afterwards . Lyttelton grieved sincerely for her , and wrote his affecting ‘ Monody ’ on the subject . When his party triumphed , he was created a Lord of the Treasury , and afterwards Chancellor of the Exchequer , with a peerage . He employed much of his leisure in literary composition , writing a good little book on the Conversion of St Paul , a laboured History of Henry II ., and some verses , including the stanza in the ‘ Castle of Indolence ’ describing Thomson —</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ A bard there dwelt , more fat than bard beseems , ’ &amp; c .—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">and a very spirited prologue to Thomson 's ‘ Coriolanus , ’ which was written</l>
     <l n="3">after that author 's death , and says of him ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">— ‘ His chaste muse employed her heaven-taught lyre</l>
     <l n="5">None but the noblest passions to inspire :</l>
     <l n="6">Not one immoral , one corrupted thought ,</l>
     <l n="7">One line which , dying he could wish to blot . ’</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Lyttelton himself died August 22 , 1773 , aged sixty-four . His History is now little read . It took him , it is said , thirty years to write it , and he employed another man to point it — a fact recalling what is told of Macaulay , that he sent the first volume of his ‘ History of England ’ to Lord Jeffrey , who overlooked the punctuation and criticised the style . Of a series of Dialogues issued by this writer , Dr Johnson remarked , with his usual pointed severity , ‘ Here is a man telling the world what the world had all his life been telling him . ’ His ‘ Monody ’ expresses real grief in an artificial style , but has some stanzas as natural in the expression as they are pathetic in the feeling .</p>

    <head>We know very little of the history of this pleasing poet . He was born in 1729 , the son of a wine-cooper in Dublin . At the age of seventeen he wrote a farce ; entitled ‘ Love in a Mist , ’ and shortly after came to Britain as an actor . He was for a long time a performer in Digges ’ company in Edinburgh , and subsequently resided in Newcastle-upon-Tyne . Here he seems to have fallen into distressed circumstances , and was supported by a benevolent printer , at whose house he died in 1773 . His poetry is distinguished by a charming simplicity .

   <p>ROBERT FERGUSSON .</p>
   <p>This unfortunate Scottish bard was born in Edinburgh on the 17th ( some say the 5th ) of October 1751 . His father , who had been an accountant to the British Linen Company 's Bank , died early , leaving a widow and four children . Robert spent six years at the grammar schools of Edinburgh and Dundee , went for a short period to Edinburgh College , and then , having obtained a bursary , to St Andrews , where he continued till his seven - teenth year . He was at first designed for the ministry of the Scottish Church . He distinguished himself at college for his mathematical knowledge , and became a favourite of Dr Wilkie , Professor of Natural Philosophy , on whose death he wrote an elegy . He early discovered a passion for poetry , and collected materials for a tragedy on the subject of Sir William Wallace , which he never finished . He once thought of studying medicine , but had neither patience nor funds for the needful preliminary studies . He went away to reside with a rich uncle , named John Forbes , in the north , near Aberdeen . This person , however , and poor Fergusson unfortunately quarrelled ; and , after residing some months in his house , he left it in disgust , and with a few shillings in his pocket proceeded southwards . He travelled on foot , and such was the effect of his vexation and fatigue , that when he reached his mother 's house he fell into a severe fit of illness .</p>
   <p>He became , on his recovery , a copying-clerk in a solicitor 's , and afterwards in a sheriff-clerk 's office , and began to contribute to Ruddiman 's Weekly Magazine . We remember in boyhood reading some odd volumes of this production , the general matter in which was inconceivably poor , relieved only by Fergusson 's racy little Scottish poems . His evenings were spent chiefly in the tavern , amidst the gay and dissipated youth of the metropolis , to whom he was the ‘ wit , songster , and mimic . ’ That his convivial powers were extraordinary , is proved by the fact of one of his contemporaries , who survived to be a correspondent of Burns , doubting if even he equalled the fascination of Fergusson 's converse . Dissipation gradually stole in upon him , in spite of resolutions dictated by remorse . In 1773 , he collected his poems into a volume , which was warmly received , but brought him , it is believed , little pecuniary benefit . At last , under the pressure of poverty , toil , and intemperance , his reason gave way , and he was by a stratagem removed to an asylum . Here , when he found himself and became aware of his situation , he uttered a dismal shriek , and cast a wild and startled look around his cell . The history of his confinement was very similar to that of Nat Lee and Christopher Smart . For instance , a story is told of him which is an exact duplicate of one recorded of Lee . He was writing by the light of the moon , when a thin cloud crossed its disk . ‘ Jupiter , snuff the moon , ’ roared the impatient poet . The cloud thickened , and entirely darkened the light . ‘ Thou stupid god , ’ he exclaimed , ‘ thou hast snuffed it out . ’ By and by he became calmer , and had some affecting interviews with his mother and sister . A removal to his mother 's house was even contemplated , but his constitution was exhausted , and on the 16th of October 1774 , poor Fergusson breathed his last . It is interesting to know that the New Testament was his favourite companion in his cell . A little after his death arrived a letter from an old friend , a Mr Burnet , who had made a fortune in the East Indies , wishing him to come out to India , and enclosing a remittance of £ 100 to defray the expenses of the journey .</p>
   <p>Thus in his twenty-fourth year perished Robert Fergusson . He was buried in the Canongate churchyard , where Burns afterwards erected a monument to his memory , with an inscription which is familiar to most of our readers .</p>
   <p>Burns in one of his poems attributes to Fergusson ‘ glorious pairts . ’ He was certainly a youth of remarkable powers , although ‘ pairts ’ rather than high genius seems to express his calibre , he can hardly be said to sing , and he never soars . His best poems , such as ‘ The Farmer 's Ingle , ’ are just lively daguerreotypes of the life he saw around him — there is nothing ideal or lofty in any of them . His ‘ ingle-bleeze ’ burns low compared to that which in ‘ The Cottar 's Saturday Night ’ springs up aloft to heaven , like the tongue of an altar-fire . He stuffs his poems , too , with Scotch to a degree which renders them too rich for even , a Scotch - man 's taste , and as repulsive as a haggis to that of an Englishman . On the whole , Fergusson 's best claim to fame arises from the influence he exerted on the far higher genius of Burns , who seems , strangely enough , to have preferred him to Allan Ramsay .</p>

   <p>EDWARD LOVIBOND .</p>
   <p>Hampton in Middlesex was the birthplace of our next poet , Edward Lovibond . He was a gentleman of fortune , who chiefly employed his time in rural occupations . He became a director of the East India Company . He helped his friend Moore in conducting the periodical called The World , to which he contributed several papers , including the very pleasing poem entitled ‘ The Tears of Old May-Day . ’ He died in 1775 .</p>

    <head>FRANCIS FAWKES .</head>
    <head>This ‘ learned and jovial parson , ’ as Campbell calls him , was born in 1721 , in Yorkshire . He studied at Cambridge , and became curate at Croydon , in Surrey . Here he obtained the friendship of Archbishop Herring , and was by him appointed vicar of Orpington in Kent , a situation which he ultimately exchanged for the rectory of Hayes , in the same county . He translated various minor Greek poets , including Anacreon , Sappho , Bion and Moschus , Theocritus , &amp; c. He died in 1777 . His ‘ Brown Jug ’ breathes some of the spirit of the first of these writers , and two or three lines of it were once quoted triumphantly in Parliament by Sheil , while charging Peel , we think it was , with appropriating arguments from Bishop Philpotts — ‘ Harry of Exeter . ’</head>

   <p>JOHN LANGHORNE .</p>
   <p>This poetical divine was born in 1735 , at Kirkby Steven , in Westmoreland . Left fatherless at four years old , his mother fulfilled her double charge of duty with great tenderness and assiduity . He was educated at Appleby , and subsequently became assistant at the free-school of Wakefield , took deacon 's orders , and gave promise , although very young , of becoming a popular preacher . After various vicissitudes of life and fortune , and publishing a number of works in prose and verse , Langhorne repaired to London , and obtained , in 1764 , the curacy and lectureship of St John 's , Clerkenwell . He soon afterwards became assistant-preacher in Lincoln 's Inn Chapel , where he had a very intellectual audience to address , and bore a somewhat trying ordeal with complete success . He continued for a number of years in London , maintaining his reputation both as a preacher and writer . His most popular works were the ‘ Letters of Theodosius and Constantia , ’ and a translation of Plutarch 's Lives , which Wrangham afterwards corrected and improved , and which is still standard . He was twice married , and survived both his wives . He obtained the living of Blagden in Somersetshire , and in addition to it , in 1777 , a prebend in the Cathedral of Wells . He died in 1779 , aged only forty-four ; his death , it is supposed , being accelerated by intemperance , although it does not seem to have been of a gross or aggravated description . Langhorne , an amiable man , and highly popular as well as warmly beloved in his day , survives now in memory chiefly through his Plutarch 's Lives , and through a few lines in his ‘ Country Justice , ’ which are immortalised by the well - known story of Scott 's interview with Burns . Campbell puts in a plea besides for his ‘ Owen of Carron , ’ but the plea , being founded on early reading , is partial , and has not been responded to by the public .</p>

   <p>SIR WILLIAM BLACKSTONE .</p>
   <p>This is not the place for writing the life of the great lawyer whose awful wig has been singed by the sarcasm of Junius . He was born in London in 1723 , and died in 1780 . He had early coquetted with poetry , but on entering the Middle Temple he bade a ‘ Farewell to his Muse ’ in the verses subjoined . So far as lucre was concerned , he chose the better part , and rose gradually on the ladder of law to be a knight and a judge in the Court of Common Pleas . It has been conjectured , from some notes on Shakspeare published by Stevens , that Sir William continued till the end of his days to hold occasional flirtations with his old flame .</p>

   <p>JOHN SCOTT .</p>
   <p>This poet is generally known as ‘ Scott of Amwell . ’ This arises from the fact that his father , a draper in Southwark , where John was born in 1730 , retired ten years afterwards to Amwell . He had never been inoculated with the small-pox , and such was his dread of the disease , and that of his family , that for twenty years , although within twenty miles of London , he never visited it . His parents , who belonged to the amiable sect of Quakers , sent him to a day-school at Ware , but that too he left upon the first alarm of infection . At seventeen , although his education was much neglected , he began to relish reading , and was materially assisted in his studies by a neighbour of the name of Frogley , a master bricklayer , who , though somewhat illiterate , admired poetry . Scott sent his first essays to the Gentleman 's Magazine , and in his thirtieth year published four elegies , which met with a kind reception , although Dr Johnson said only of them , ‘ They are very well , but such as twenty people might write . ’ He produced afterwards ‘ The Garden , ’ ‘ Amwell , ’ and other poems , besides some rather narrow ‘ Critical Essays on the English Poets . ’ When thirty-six years of age , he submitted to inoculation , and henceforward visited London frequently , and became acquainted with Dr Johnson , Sir William Jones , Mrs Montague , and other eminent characters . He was a very active promoter of local improvements , and diligent in cultivating his grounds and garden . He was twice married , his first wife being a daughter of his friend Frogley . He died in 1783 , not of that disease which he so ‘ greatly feared , ’ but of a putrid fever , at Radcliff . One note of his , entitled ‘ Ode on Hearing the Drum , ’ still reverberates on the ear of poetic readers . Wordsworth has imitated it in his ‘ Andrew Jones . ’ Sir Walter makes Rachel Geddes say , in ‘ Redgauntlet , ’ alluding to books of verse , ‘ Some of our people do indeed hold that every writer who is not with us is against us , but brother Joshua is mitigated in his opinions , and correspondeth with our friend John Scott of Amwell , who hath himself constructed verses well approved of even in the world . ’</p>

   <p>ALEXANDER ROSS .</p>
   <p>Of this fine old Scottish poet we regret that we can tell our readers so little . He was born in 1698 , became parish schoolmaster at Lochlee in Angusshire , and published , by the advice of Dr Beattie , in 1768 , a volume entitled ‘ Helenore ; or , The Fortunate Shepherdess : a Pastoral Tale in the Scottish Dialect ; along with a few Songs . ’ Some of these latter , such as ‘ Woo 'd , and Married , and a ’ ,' became very popular . Beattie loved the ‘ good-humoured , social , happy old man , ’ who was ‘ passing rich ’ on twenty pounds a-year , and wrote in the Aberdeen Journal a poetical letter in the Scotch language to promote the sale of his poem . Ross died in 1784 , about eighty-six years old , and is buried in a churchyard at the east end of the loch .</p>
   <p>Lochlee is a very solitary and romantic spot . The road to it from the low country , or Howe of the Mearns , conducts us through a winding , unequal , but very interesting glen , which , after bearing at its foot many patches of corn , yellowing amidst thick green copsewood and birch trees , fades and darkens gradually into a stern , woodless , and rocky defile , which emerges on a solitary loch , lying ‘ dern and dreary ’ amidst silent hills . It is one of those lakes which divide the distance between the loch and the tarn , being two miles in length and one in breadth . The hills , which are stony and savage , sink directly down upon its brink . A house or two are all the dwellings in view . The celebrated Thomas Guthrie dearly loves this lake , lives beside it for months at a time , and is often seen rowing his lonely boat in the midst of it , by sunlight and by moonlight too . On the west , one bold , sword-like summit , Craig Macskeldie by name , cuts the air , and relieves the monotony of the other mountains . Fit rest has Ross found in that calm , rural burying-place , beside ‘ the rude forefathers of the hamlet , ’ with short , sweet , flower - sprinkled grass covering his dust , the low voice of the lake sounding a few yards from his cold ear , and a plain gravestone uniting with his native mountains to form his memorial . ‘ Fortunate Shepherd , ’ ( shall we call him ? ) to have obtained a grave so intensely characteristic of a Scottish poet !</p>

   <p>RICHARD GLOVER .</p>
   <p>Glover was a man so remarkable as to be thought capable of having written the letters of Junius , although no one now almost names his name or reads his poetry . He was the son of a Hamburgh merchant in London , and born ( 1712 ) in St Martin 's Lane , Cannon Street . He was educated at a private school in Surrey , but being designed for trade , was never sent to a university , yet by his own exertions he became an excellent classical scholar . At sixteen he wrote a poem to the memory of Sir Isaac Newton , and at twenty-five produced nine books of his ‘ Leonidas . ’ Partly through its own merits , partly through its liberal political sentiments , and partly through the influence of Lord Cobham , to whom it was inscribed , and the praise of Fielding and Chatham , it became very popular . In 1739 , he produced a poem entitled ‘ London ; or , The Progress of Commerce , ’ and a spirited ballad entitled ‘ Admiral Hosier 's Ghost , ’ which we have given , both designed to rouse the national spirit against the Spaniards .</p>
   <p>Glover was a merchant , and very highly esteemed among his commercial brethren , although at one time unfortunate in business . When forced by his failure to seek retirement , he produced a tragedy on the subject of Boadicea , which ran the usual nine nights , although it has long since ceased to be acted or read . In his later years his affairs improved ; he returned again to public life , was elected to Parliament , and approved himself a painstaking and popular M. P . In 1770 , he enlarged his ‘ Leonidas ’ from nine books to twelve , and afterwards wrote a sequel to it , entitled ‘ The Athenais . ’ Glover spent his closing years in opulent retirement , enjoying the intimacy and respect of the most eminent men of the day , and died in 1785 .</p>
   <p>‘ Leonidas ’ may be called the epic of the eighteenth century , and betrays the artificial genius of its age . The poet rises to his flight like a heavy heron — not a hawk or eagle . Passages in it are good , but the effect of the whole is dulness . It reminds you of Cowper 's ‘ Homer , ’ in which all is accurate , but all is cold , and where even the sound of battle lulls to slumber — or of Edwin Atherstone 's ‘ Fall of Nineveh , ’ where you are fatigued with uniform pomp , and the story struggles and staggers under a load of words . Thomson exclaimed when he heard of the work of Glover , ‘ He write an epic , who never saw a mountain ! ’ And there was justice in the remark . The success of ‘ Leonidas ’ was probably one cause of the swarm of epics which appeared in the close of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century .— Cottle himself being , according to De Quincey , ‘ the author of four epic poems , and a new kind of blacking . ’ Their day seems now for ever at an end .</p>

    <head>WILLIAM WHITEHEAD .</head>
    <head>There was also a Paul Whitehead , who wrote a satire entitled ‘ Manners , ’ which is highly praised by Boswell , and mentioned contemptuously by Campbell , and who lives in the couplet of Churchill —</head>
     <l n="1">‘ May I ( can worse disgrace on manhood fall ? )</l>
     <l n="2">Be born a Whitehead , and baptized a Paul . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>William Whitehead was the son of a baker in Cambridge , was born in 1715 , and studied first at Winchester , and then in Clare Hall , in his own city . He became tutor to the son of the Earl of Jersey , wrote one or two poor plays , and in 1757 , on the death of Colley Cibber , was appointed Poet-Laureate — the office having previously been refused by Gray . This roused against him a large class of those ‘ beings capable of envying even a poet-laureate , ’ to use Gray 's expression , and especially the wrath of Churchill , then the man-mountain of satiric literature , who , in his ‘ Ghost , ’ says —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ But he who in the laureate chair ,</l>
     <l n="2">By grace , not merit , planted there ,</l>
     <l n="3">In awkward pomp is seen to sit ,</l>
     <l n="4">And by his patent proves his wit , ’ &amp; c .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>To these attacks Whitehead , who was a good-natured and modest man , made no reply . In his latter years the Laureate resided in the family of Lord Jersey , and died in 1785 . His poem called ‘ Variety ’ is light and pleasant , and deserves a niche in our ‘ Specimens . ’</p>

   <p>WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE .</p>
   <p>This poet was born in Langholm , Dumfriesshire , in 1734 . His father was minister of the parish , but removed to Edinburgh , where William , after attending the High School , became clerk to a brewery , and ultimately a partner in the concern . In this he failed , however ; and in 1764 he repaired to London to prosecute literature . Lord Lyttelton became his patron , although he did him so little service in a secular point of view , that Mickle was fain to accept the situation of corrector to the Clarendon Press at Oxford . Here he published his ‘ Pollio , ’ his ‘ Concubine , ’ — a poem in the manner of Spenser , very sweetly and musically written , which became popular ,— and in 1771 the first canto of a translation of the ‘ Lusiad ’ of Camoens . This translation , which he completed in 1775 , was published by subscription , and at once increased his fortune and established his fame . He had resigned his office of corrector of the press , and was residing with Mr Tomkins , a farmer at Foresthill , near Oxford . In 1779 , he went out to Portugal as secretary to Commodore Johnstone , and , as the translator of Camoens , was received with much distinction . On his return with a little money , he married Mr Tomkins ’ daughter , who had a little more , and took up his permanent residence at Foresthill , where he died of a short illness in 1788 .</p>
   <p>His translation of the ‘ Lusiad ’ is understood to be too free and flowery , and the translator stands in the relation to Camoens which Pope does to Homer . ‘ Cumnor Hall ’ has suggested to Scott his brilliant romance of ‘ Kenilworth , ’ and is a garland worthy of being bound up in the beautiful locks of Amy Robsart for evermore . ‘ Are ye sure the news is true ? ’ is a song true to the very soul of Scottish and of general nature , and worthy , as Burns says , of ‘ the first poet . ’</p>

   <p>LORD NUGENT .</p>
   <p>Robert Craggs , afterwards created Lord Nugent , was an Irishman , a younger son of Michael Nugent , by the daughter of Robert , Lord Trimlestown , and born in 1709 . He was in 1741 elected M. P . for St Mawes , in Cornwall , and became in 1747 comptroller to the Prince of Wales ’ household . He after - wards made peace with the Court , and received various promotions and marks of favour besides the peerage . In 1739 , he published anonymously a volume of poems possessing considerable merit . He was converted from Popery , and wrote some vigorous verses on the occasion . Unfortunately , however , he relapsed , and again celebrated the event in a very weak poem , entitled ‘ Faith . ’ He died in 1788 . Although a man of decided talent , as his ‘ Ode to Mankind ’ proves , Nugent does not stand very high either in the catalogue of Irish patriots or of ‘ royal and noble authors . ’</p>

So , at least , Campbell asserts ; but he strangely calls him a student of the same standing , whereas , in fact , Robertson saw light in 1721 , and had been a settled minister five years before Logan was born . After finishing his studies , he became tutor in the family of Mr Sinclair of Ulbster , and the late well-known Sir John Sinclair was one of his pupils . When licensed to preach , Logan became popular , and was in his twenty-fifth year appointed one of the ministers of South Leith . In 1781 , he read in Edinburgh a course of lectures on the Philosophy of History , and in 1782 , he printed one of them , on the Government of Asia . In the same year he published a volume of poems , which were well received . In 1783 , he wrote a tragedy called ‘ Runnymede , ’ which was , owing to some imagined incendiary matter , prohibited from being acted on the London boards , but which was produced on the Edinburgh stage , and afterwards published . This , along with some alleged irregularities of conduct on the part of Logan , tended to alienate his flock , and he was induced to retire on a small annuity . He betook himself to London , where , in conjunction with the Rev . Mr Thomson ,— who had left the parish of Monzievaird , in Perthshire , owing to a scandal ,— he wrote for the English Review , and was employed to defend Warren Hastings . This he did in an able manner , although a well-known story describes him as listening to Sheridan , on the Oude case , with intense interest , and exclaiming , after the first hour , ‘ This is mere declamation without proof ’ — after the next two , ‘ This is a man of extraordinary powers ’ — and ere the close of the matchless oration , ‘ Of all the monsters in history , Warren Hastings is the vilest . ’ Logan died in the year 1788 , in his lodgings , Marlborough Street . His sermons were published shortly after his death , and if parts of them are , as is alleged , pilfered from a Swiss divine , ( George Joachim Zollikofer ,) they have not remained exclusively with the thief , since no sermons have been so often reproduced in Scottish pulpits as the elegant orations issued under the name of Logan .</p>
   <p>We have already declined to enter on the controversy about ‘ The Cuckoo , ’ intimating , however , our belief , founded partly upon Logan 's unscrupulous character and partly on internal evidence , that it was originally written by Bruce , but probably polished to its present perfection by Logan , whose other writings give us rather the impression of a man of varied accomplishments and excellent taste , than of deep feeling or original genius . If Logan were not the author of ‘ The Cuckoo , ’ there was a special baseness connected with the fact , that when Burke sought him out in Edinburgh , solely from his admiration of that poem , he owned the soft and false impeachment , and rolled as a sweet morsel praise from the greatest man of the age , which he knew was the rightful due of another .</p>

   <p>THOMAS BLACKLOCK .</p>
   <p>The amiable Dr Blacklock deserves praise for his character and for his conduct under very peculiar circumstances , much more than for his poetry . He was born at Annan , where his father was a bricklayer , in 1721 . When about six months old , he lost his eyesight by small-pox . His father used to read to him , especially poetry , and through the kindness of friends he acquired some knowledge of the Latin tongue . His father having been accidentally killed when Thomas was nineteen , it might have fared hard with him , but Dr Stevenson , an eminent medical man in Edinburgh , who had seen some verses composed by the blind youth , took him to the capital , sent him to college to study divinity , and encouraged him to write and to publish poetry . His volume , to which was prefixed an account of the author , by Professor Spence of Oxford , attracted much attention . Blacklock was licensed to preach in 1759 , and three years afterwards was married to a Miss Johnstone of Dumfries , an exemplary but plain-looking lady , whose beauty her husband was wont to praise so warmly that his friends were thankful that his infirmity was never removed , and thought how justly Cupid had been painted blind . He was even , through the influence of the Earl of Selkirk , appointed to the parish of Kirkcudbright , but the parishioners opposed his induction on the plea of his want of sight , and , in consideration of a small annuity , he withdrew his claims . He finally settled down in Edinburgh , where he supported himself chiefly by keeping young gentlemen as boarders in his house . His chief amusements were poetry and music . His conduct to ( 1786 ) and correspondence with Burns are too well known to require to be noticed at length here . He published a paper of no small merit in the ‘ Encyclopaedia Britannica ’ on Blindness , and is the author of a work entitled ‘ Paraclesis ; or , Consolations of Religion , ’ — which surely none require more than the blind . He died of a nervous fever on the 7th of July 1791 , so far fortunate that he did not live to see the ruin of his immortal protégé .</p>
   <p>Blacklock was a most amiable , genial , and benevolent being . He was sometimes subject to melancholy — unlike many of the blind , and one especially , whom we name not , but who , still living , bears a striking resemblance to Blacklock in fineness of mind , warmth of heart , and high - toned piety , but who is cheerful as the day . As to his poetry , it is undoubtedly wonderful , considering the circumstances of its production , if not per se . Dr Johnson says to Boswell ,— ‘ As Blacklock had the misfortune to be blind , we may be absolutely sure that the passages in his poems descriptive of visible objects are combinations of what he remembered of the works of other writers who could see . That foolish fellow Spence has laboured to explain philosophically how Blacklock may have done , by his own faculties , what it is impossible he should do . The solution , as I have given it , is plain . Suppose I know a man to be so lame that he is absolutely incapable to move himself , and I find him in a different room from that in which I left him , shall I puzzle myself with idle conjectures that perhaps his nerves have , by some unknown change , all at once become effective ? No , sir ; it is clear how he got into a different room — he was CARRIED . ’</p>
   <p>Perhaps there is a fallacy in this somewhat dogmatic statement . Perhaps the blind are not so utterly dark but they may have certain dim simulacra of external objects before their eyes and minds . Apart from this , however , Blacklock 's poetry endures only from its connexion with the author 's misfortune , and from the fact that through the gloom he groped greatly to find and give the burning hand of the peasant poet the squeeze of a kindred spirit ,— kindred , we mean , in feeling and heart , although very far removed in strength of intellect and genius .</p>

   <p>MISS ELLIOT AND MRS COCKBURN .</p>
   <p>Here we find two ladies amicably united in the composition of one of Scotland 's finest songs , the ‘ Flowers of the Forest . ’ Miss Jane Elliot of Minto , sister of Sir Gilbert Elliot of Minto , wrote the first and the finest of the two versions . Mrs Cockburn , the author of the second , was a remarkable person . Her maiden name was Alicia Rutherford , and she was the daughter of Mr Rutherford of Fernilee , in Selkirkshire . She married Mr Patrick Cockburn , a younger son of Adam Cockburn of Ormiston , Lord Justice-Clerk of Scotland . She became prominent in the literary circles of Edinburgh , and an intimate friend of David Hume , with whom she carried on a long and serious correspondence on religious subjects , in which it is understood the philosopher opened up his whole heart , but which is unfortunately lost . Mrs Cockburn , who was born in 1714 , lived to 1794 , and saw and proclaimed the wonderful promise of Walter Scott . She wrote a great deal , but the ‘ Flowers of the Forest ’ is the only one of her effusions that has been published . A ludicrous story is told of her son , who was a dissipated youth , returning one night drunk , while a large party of savans was assembled in the house , and locking himself up in the room in which their coats and hats were deposited . Nothing would rouse him ; and the company had to depart in the best substitutes they could find for their ordinary habiliments ,— Hume ( characteristically ) in a dreadnought , Monboddo in an old shabby hat , &amp; c .— the echoes of the midnight Potterrow resounding to their laughter at their own odd figures . It is believed that Mrs Cockburn 's song was really occasioned by the bankruptcy of a number of gentlemen in Selkirkshire , although she chose to throw the new matter of lamentation into the old mould of song .</p>

   <p>SUSANNA BLAMIRE .</p>
   <p>This lady was born at Cardew Hall , near Carlisle , and remained there from the date of her birth ( 1747 ) till she was twenty years of age , when she accompanied her sister — who had married Colonel Graham of Duchray , Perthshire — to Scotland , and continued there some years . She became enamoured of Scottish music and poetry , and thus qualified herself for writing such sweet lyrics as ‘ The Nabob , ’ and ‘ What ails this heart o ’ mine ? ’ On her return to Cumberland she wrote several pieces illustrative of Cumbrian manners . She died unmarried in 1794 . Her poetical pieces , some of which had been floating through the country in the form of popular songs , were collected by Mr Patrick Maxwell , and published in 1842 . The two we have quoted rank with those of Lady Nairne in nature and pathos .</p>

    <head>JAMES MACPHERSON .</head>
    <head>Now we come to one who , with all his faults , was not only a real , but a great poet . The events of his life need not detain us long . He was born at Kingussie , Inverness-shire , in 1738 , and educated at Aberdeen . At twenty he published a very juvenile production in verse , called ‘ The Highlandman : a Heroic Poem , in six cantos . ’ He taught for some time the school of Ruthven , near his native place , and became afterwards tutor in the family of Graham of Balgowan . While attending a scion of this family — afterwards Lord Lynedoch — at Moffat Wells , Macpherson became acquainted with Home , the author of ‘ Douglas , ’ and shewed to him some fragments of Gaelic poetry , translated by himself . Home was delighted with these specimens , and the consequence was , that our poet , under the patronage of Home , Blair , Adam Fergusson , and Dr Carlyle , ( the once famous ‘ Jupiter Carlyle , ’ minister of Inveresk — called ‘ Jupiter ’ because he used to sit to sculptors for their statues of ‘ Father Jove , ’ and declared by Sir Walter Scott to have been the ‘ grandest demigod he ever saw , ’ ) published , in a small volume of sixty pages , his ‘ Fragments of Ancient Poetry , translated from the Gaelic or Erse language . ’ This brochure became popular , and Macpherson was provided with a purse to go to the Highlands to collect additional pieces . The result was , in 1762 , ‘ Fingal : an Epic Poem ; ’ and , in the next year , ‘ Temora , ’ another epic poem . Their sale was prodigious , and the effect not equalled till , twenty-four years later , the poems of Burns appeared . He realised £ 1200 by these productions . In 1764 he accompanied Governor Johnston to Pensacola as his secretary , but quarrelled with him , and returned to London . Here he became a professional pamphleteer , always taking the ministerial side , and diversifying these labours by publishing a translation of Homer , in the style of his Ossian , which , as Coleridge says of another production , was ‘ damned unanimously . ’ Our readers are familiar with his row with Dr Johnson , who , when threatened with personal chastisement for his obstinate and fierce incredulity in the matter of Ossian , thus wrote the author :—</head>
     <l n="1">‘ To Mr JAMES MACPHERSON .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ I received your foolish and impudent letter . Any violence offered me I shall do the best to repel , and what I cannot do for myself , the law shall do for me . I hope I shall not be deterred from detecting what I think a cheat by the menaces of a ruffian .</p>
   <p>‘ What would you have me to retract ? I thought your book an imposture . I think it an imposture still . For this opinion I have given my reasons to the public , which I dare you to refute . Your rage I defy . Your abilities , since your Homer , are not so formidable , and what I hear of your morals inclines me to pay regard , not to what you shall say , but to what you shall prove . You may print this if you will .</p>
   <p>‘ SAM . JOHNSON . ’</p>
   <p>Nothing daunted by this , and a hundred other similar rebuffs ; Macpherson , like Mallett before him , but with twenty times his abilities , pursued his peculiar course . He was appointed agent for the Nabob of Arcot , and became M. P . for Carnelford . In this way he speedily accumulated a handsome fortune , and in 1789 , while still a youngish man , he retired to his native parish , where he bought the estate of Raitts , and founded a splendid villa , called Belleville , where , in ease and affluence , he spent his remaining days . Surviving Johnson , his ablest opponent , by twelve years , he died on the 17th of February 1796 , in the full view of Ossian 's country . One of his daughters became his heir , and another was the first wife of Sir David Brewster . Macpherson in his will ordered that his body should be buried in Westminster Abbey , and left a sum of money to erect a monument to him near Belleville . He lies , accordingly , in Poets ’ Corner , and a marble obelisk to his memory may be seen near Kingussie , in the centre of some trees .</p>
   <p>There is nothing new that is true , or true that is new , to be said about the questions connected with Ossian 's Poems . That Macpherson is the sole author is a theory now as generally abandoned as the other , which held that he was simply a free translator of the old bard . To the real fragments of Ossian , which he found in the Highlands , he acted very much as he did to the ancient property of Raitts , in his own native parish . This he purchased in its crude state , and beautified into a mountain paradise . He changed , however , its name into Belleville , and it had been better if he had behaved in a similar way with the poems , and published them as , with some little groundwork from another , the veritable writings of James Macpherson , Esq . The ablest opponent of his living reputation was , as we said , Johnson ; and the ablest enemy of his posthumous fame has been Macaulay . We are at a loss to understand his animosity to the author of Ossian . Were the Macphersons and Macaulays ever at feud , and did the historian lose his great-great-grandmother in some onslaught made on the Hebrides by the progenitors of the pseudo-Ossian ? Macpherson as a man we respect not , and we are persuaded that the greater part of Ossian 's Poems can be traced no further than his teeming brain . Nor are we careful to defend his poetry from the common charges of monotony , affectation , and fustian . But we deem Macaulay grossly unjust in his treatment of Macpherson 's genius and its results , and can fortify our judgment by that of Sir Walter Scott and Professor Wilson , two men as far superior to the historian in knowledge of the Highlands and of Highland song , and in genuine poetic taste , as they were confessedly in original imagination . The former says , ‘ Macpherson was certainly a man of high talents , and his poetic powers are honourable to his country . ’ Wilson , in an admirable paper in Blackwood for November 1839 , while admitting many faults in Ossian , eloquently proclaims the presence in his strains of much of the purest , most pathetic , and most sublime poetry , instancing the ‘ Address to the Sun ’ as equal to anything in Homer or Milton . Both these great writers have paid Macpherson a higher compliment still ,— they have imitated him , and the speeches of Allan Macaulay ( a far greater genius than his namesake ) , Ranald MacEagh , and Elspeth MacTavish , in the ‘ Waverley Novels , ’ and such , articles by Christopher North as ‘ Cottages , ’ ‘ Hints for the Holidays , ’ and a ‘ Glance at Selby 's Ornithology , ’ are all coloured by familiarity and fellow-feeling with Ossian 's style . Best of all , the Highlanders as a nation have accepted Ossian as their bard ; he is as much the poet of Morven as Burns of Coila , and it is as hopeless to dislodge the one from the Highland as the other from the Lowland heart . The true way to learn to appreciate Ossian 's poetry is not to hurry , as Macaulay seems to have done , in a steamer from Glasgow to Oban , and thence to Ballachulish , and thence through Glencoe , ( mistaking a fine lake for a ‘ sullen pool ’ on his way , and ignoring altogether its peculiar features of grandeur ,) and thence to Inverness or Edinburgh ; but it is to live for years — as Macpherson did while writing Ossian , and Wilson also did to some extent — under the shadow of the mountains ,— to wander through lonely moors amidst drenching mists and rains ,— to hold trysts with thunder-storms on the summit of savage hills ,— to bathe after nightfall in dreary tarns ,— to lie over the ledge and dip one 's fingers in the spray of cataracts ,— to plough a solitary path into the heart of forests , and to sleep and dream for hours amidst their sunless glades ,— to meet on twilight hills the apparition of the winter moon rising over snowy wastes ,— to descend by her ghastly light precipices where the eagles are sleeping ,— and , returning home , to be haunted by night-visions of mightier mountains , wilder desolations , and giddier descents ;— experience somewhat like this is necessary to form a true ‘ Child of the Mist , ’ and to give the full capacity for sharing in or appreciating the shadowy , solitary , pensive , and magnificent spirit which tabernacles in Ossian 's poetry .</p>
   <p>Never , at least , can we forget how , in our boyhood , while feeling , but quite unable to express , the emotions which were suggested by the bold shapes of mountains resting against the stars , mirrored from below in lakes and wild torrents , and quaking sometimes in concert with the quaking couch of the half-slumbering earthquake , the poems of Ossian served to give our thoughts an expression which they could not otherwise have found — how they at once strengthened and consolidated enthusiasm , and are now regarded with feelings which , wreathed around earliest memories and the strongest fibres of the heart , no criticism can ever weaken or destroy .</p>
   <p>OSSIAN 'S ADDRESS TO THE SUN .</p>
   <p>I feel the sun , O Malvina !— leave me to my rest . Perhaps they may come to my dreams ; I think I hear a feeble voice ! The beam of heaven delights to shine on the grave of Carthon : I feel it warm around .</p>
   <p>O thou that rollest above , round as the shield of my fathers ! Whence are thy beams , O sun ! thy everlasting light ? Thou comest forth in thy awful beauty ; the stars hide themselves in the sky ; the moon , cold and pale , sinks in the western wave ; but thou thyself movest alone . Who can be a companion of thy course ? The oaks of the mountains fall ; the mountains themselves decay with years ; the ocean shrinks and grows again ; the moon herself is lost in heaven , but thou art for ever the same , rejoicing in the brightness of thy course . When the world is dark with tempests , when thunder rolls and lightning flies , thou lookest in thy beauty from the clouds , and laughest at the storm . But to Ossian thou lookest in vain , for he beholds thy beams no more ; whether thy yellow hair flows on the eastern clouds , or thou tremblest at the gates of the west . But thou art perhaps , like me , for a season ; thy years will have an end . Thou shalt sleep in thy clouds careless of the voice of the morning . Exult then , O sun , in the strength of thy youth ! Age is dark and unlovely ; it is like the glimmering light of the moon when it shines through broken clouds , and the mist is on the hills : the blast of the north is on the plain ; the traveller shrinks in the midst of his journey .</p>
   <p>DESOLATION OF BALCLUTHA .</p>
   <p>I have seen the walls of Balclutha , but they were desolate . The fire had resounded in the halls ; and the voice of the people is heard no more . The stream of Clutha was removed from its place by the fall of the walls . The thistle shook there its lonely head ; the moss whistled to the wind . The fox looked out from the windows ; the rank grass of the wall waved round its head . Desolate is the dwelling of Moina ; silence is in the house of her fathers . Raise the song of mourning , O bards ! over the land of strangers . They have but fallen before us : for one day we must fall . Why dost thou build the hall , son of the winged days ? Thou lookest from thy towers to-day : yet a few years , and the blast of the desert comes ; it howls in thy empty court , and whistles round thy half-worn shield . And let the blast of the desert come ! we shall be renowned in our day ! The mark of my arm shall be in battle ; my name in the song of bards . Raise the song , send round the shell : let joy be heard in my hall . When thou , sun of heaven , shalt fail ! if thou shalt fail , thou mighty light ! if thy brightness is but for a season , like Fingal , our fame shall survive thy beams . Such was the song of Fingal in the day of his joy .</p>
   <p>FINGAL AND THE SPIRIT OF LODA .</p>
   <p>Night came down on the sea ; Roma 's bay received the ship . A rock bends along the coast with all its echoing wood . On the top is the circle of Loda , the mossy stone of power ! A narrow plain spreads beneath , covered with grass and aged trees , which the midnight winds , in their wrath , had torn from the shaggy rock . The blue course of a stream is there ! the lonely blast of ocean pursues the thistle 's beard . The flame of three oaks arose : the feast is spread around : but the soul of the king is sad , for Carric-thura 's chief distressed .</p>
   <p>The wan , cold moon , rose in the east ; sleep descended on the youths ! Their blue helmets glitter to the beam ; the fading fire decays . But sleep did not rest on the king : he rose in the midst of his arms , and slowly ascended the hill , to behold the flame of Sarno 's tower .</p>
   <p>The flame was dim and distant , the moon hid her red face in the east . A blast came from the mountain , on its wings was the spirit of Loda . He came to his place in his terrors , and shook his dusky spear . His eyes appear like flames in his dark face ; his voice is like distant thunder . Fingal advanced his spear in night , and raised his voice on high .</p>
   <p>Son of night , retire : call thy winds , and fly ! Why dost thou come to my presence , with thy shadowy arms ? Do I fear thy gloomy form , spirit of dismal Loda ? Weak is thy shield of clouds : feeble is that meteor , thy sword ! The blast rolls them together ; and thou thyself art lost . Fly from my presence , son of night ! Call thy winds , and fly !</p>
   <p>Dost thou force me from my place ? replied the hollow voice . The people bend before me . I turn the battle in the field of the brave . I look on the nations , and they vanish : my nostrils pour the blast of death . I come abroad on the winds : the tempests are before my face . But my dwelling is calm , above the clouds ; the fields of my rest are pleasant .</p>
   <p>Dwell in thy pleasant fields , said the king ; let Comhal 's son be forgot . Do my steps ascend , from my hills , into thy peaceful plains ? Do I meet thee , with a spear , on thy cloud , spirit of dismal Loda ? Why then dost thou frown on me ? Why shake thine airy spear ? Thou frownest in vain : I never fled from the mighty in war . And shall the sons of the wind frighten the king of Morven ? No : he knows the weakness of their arms !</p>
   <p>Fly to thy land , replied the form : receive the wind , and fly ! The blasts are in the hollow of my hand : the course of the storm is mine . The king of Sora is my son , he bends at the storm of my power . His battle is around Carric-thura ; and he will prevail ! Fly to thy land , son of Comhal , or feel my flaming wrath !</p>
   <p>He lifted high his shadowy spear ! He bent forward his dreadful height . Fingal , advancing , drew his sword ; the blade of dark-brown Luno . The gleaming path of the steel winds through the gloomy ghost . The form fell shapeless into air , like a column of smoke , which the staff of the boy disturbs , as it rises from the half-extinguished furnace .</p>
   <p>The spirit of Loda shrieked , as , rolled into himself , he rose on the wind . Inistore shook at the sound , the waves heard it on the deep . They stopped in their course with fear : the friends of Fingal started at once , and took their heavy spears . They missed the king ; they rose in rage ; all their arms resound !</p>
   <p>ADDRESS TO THE MOON .</p>
   <p>Daughter of heaven , fair art thou ! the silence of thy face is pleasant ! Thou comest forth in loveliness . The stars attend thy blue course in the east . The clouds rejoice in thy presence , O moon ! they brighten their dark-brown sides . Who is like thee in heaven , light of the silent night ? The stars are ashamed in thy presence . They turn away their sparkling eyes . Whither dost thou retire from thy course , when the darkness of thy countenance grows ? hast thou thy hall , like Ossian ? dwellest thou in the shadow of grief ? have thy sisters fallen from heaven ? are they who rejoiced with thee at night no more ? Yes , they have fallen , fair light ! and thou dost often retire to mourn . But thou thyself shalt fail one night , and leave thy blue path in heaven . The stars will then lift their heads : they , who were ashamed in thy presence , will rejoice . Thou art now clothed with thy brightness . Look from thy gates in the sky . Burst the cloud , O wind ! that the daughter of night may look forth ! that the shaggy mountains may brighten , and the ocean roll its white waves in light .</p>
   <p>FINGAL 'S SPIRIT-HOME .</p>
   <p>His friends sit around the king , on mist ! They hear the songs of Ullin : he strikes the half-viewless harp . He raises the feeble voice . The lesser heroes , with a thousand meteors , light the airy hall . Malvina rises in the midst ; a blush is on her cheek . She beholds the unknown faces of her fathers . She turns aside her humid eyes . ‘ Art thou come so soon ? ’ said Fingal , ‘ daughter of generous Toscar . Sadness dwells in the halls of Lutha . My aged son is sad ! I hear the breeze of Cona , that was wont to lift thy heavy locks . It comes to the hall , but thou art not there . Its voice is mournful among the arms of thy fathers ! Go , with thy rustling wing , O breeze ! sigh on Malvina 's tomb . It rises yonder beneath the rock , at the blue stream of Lutha . The maids are departed to their place . Thou alone , O breeze , mournest there ! ’</p>

    <head>WILLIAM MASON .</head>
    <head>This gentleman is now nearly forgotten , except as the friend , biographer , and literary executor of Gray . He was born in 1725 , and died in 1797 . His tragedies , ‘ Elfrida ’ and ‘ Caractacus , ’ are spirited declamations in dramatic form , not dramas . His odes have the turgidity without the grandeur of Gray 's . His ‘ English Garden ’ is too long and too formal . His Life of Gray was an admirable innovation on the form of biography then prevalent , interspersing , as it does , journals and letters with mere narrative . Mason was a royal chaplain , held the living of Ashton , and was precentor of York Cathedral . We quote the best of his minor poems .</head>

   <p>JOHN LOWE .</p>
   <p>The author of ‘ Mary 's Dream ’ was born in 1750 , at Kenmore , Galloway , and was the son of a gardener . He became a student of divinity , and acted as tutor in the family of a Mr McGhie of Airds . A daughter of Mr McGhie was attached to a gentleman named Miller , a surgeon at sea , and on the occasion of his death Lowe wrote his beautiful ‘ Mary 's Dream , ’ the exquisite simplicity and music of the first stanza of which has often been admired . Lowe was betrothed to a sister of ‘ Mary , ’ but having emigrated to America , he married another , fell into dissipated habits , and died in a miserable plight at Fredericksburgh in 1798 . He wrote many other pieces , but none equal to ‘ Mary 's Dream . ’</p>

   <p>JOSEPH WARTON .</p>
   <p>This accomplished critic and poet was born in 1722 . He was son to the Vicar of Basingstoke , and brother to Thomas Warton . ( See a former volume for his life . ) Joseph was educated at Winchester College , and became intimate there with William Collins . He wrote when quite young some poetry in the Gentleman 's Magazine . He was in due time removed to Oriel College , where he composed two poems , entitled ‘ The Enthusiast , ’ and ‘ The Dying Indian . ’ In 1744 , he took the degree of Bachelor of Arts at Oxford , and was ordained to his father 's curacy at Basingstoke . He went thence to Chelsea , but did not remain there long , owing to some disagreement with his parishioners , and returned to Basingstoke . In 1746 , he published a volume of Odes , and in the preface expressed his hope that it might be successful as an attempt to bring poetry back from the didactic and satirical taste of the age , to the truer channels of fancy and description . The motive of this attempt was , however , more praiseworthy than its success was conspicuous .</p>
   <p>In 1748 , Warton was presented by the Duke of Bolton to the rectory of Winslade , and he straightway married a Miss Daman , to whom he had for some time been attached . In the same year he began , and in 1753 he finished and printed , an edition of Virgil in English and Latin . Of this large , elaborate work , Warton himself supplied only the life of Virgil , with three essays on pastoral , didactic , and epic poetry , and a poetical version of the Eclogues and the Georgics , more correct but less spirited than Dryden 's . He adopted Pitt 's version of the Aeneid , and his friends furnished some of the dissertations , notes , &amp; c. Shortly after , he contributed twenty-four excellent papers , including some striking allegories , and some good criticisms on Shakspeare , to the Adventurer . In 1754 , he was appointed to the living of Tunworth , and the next year was elected second master of Winchester School . Soon after this he published anonymously ‘ An Essay on the Writings and Genius of Pope , ’ which , whether because he failed in convincing the public that his estimate of Pope was the correct one , or because he stood in awe of Warburton , he did not complete or reprint for twenty-six years . It is a somewhat gossiping book , but full of information and interest .</p>
   <p>In May 1766 , he was made head-master of Winchester . In 1768 , he lost his wife , and next year married a Miss Nicholas of Winchester . In 1782 , he was promoted , through Bishop Lowth , to a prebend 's post in St Paul 's , and to the living of Thorley , which he exchanged for that of Wickham . Other livings dropped in upon him , and in 1793 he resigned the mastership of Winchester , and went to reside at Wickham . Here he employed himself in preparing an edition of Pope , which he published in 1797 . In 1800 he died .</p>
   <p>Warton , like his brother , did good service in resisting the literary despotism of Pope , and in directing the attention of the public to the forgotten treasures of old English poetry . He was a man of extensive learning , a very fair and candid , as well as acute critic , and his ‘ Ode to Fancy ’ proves him to have possessed no ordinary genius .</p>

    <head>ODE TO FANCY .</head>
     <l n="1">O parent of each lovely Muse ,</l>
     <l n="2">Thy spirit o'er my soul diffuse ,</l>
     <l n="3">O'er all my artless songs preside ,</l>
     <l n="4">My footsteps to thy temple guide ,</l>
     <l n="5">To offer at thy turf-built shrine ,</l>
     <l n="6">In golden cups no costly wine ,</l>
     <l n="7">No murdered fatling of the flock ,</l>
     <l n="8">But flowers and honey from the rock .</l>
     <l n="9">O nymph with loosely-flowing hair ,</l>
     <l n="10">With buskined leg , and bosom bare ,</l>
     <l n="11">Thy waist with myrtle-girdle bound ,</l>
     <l n="12">Thy brows with Indian feathers crowned ,</l>
     <l n="13">Waving in thy snowy hand</l>
     <l n="14">An all-commanding magic wand ,</l>

     <l n="17">Whose rapid wings thy flight convey</l>

     <l n="20">Conspicuous to thy piercing eyes .</l>
     <l n="21">O lover of the desert , hail !</l>
     <l n="22">Say , in what deep and pathless vale ,</l>
     <l n="23">Or on what hoary mountain 's side ,</l>
     <l n="24">‘ Mid fall of waters , you reside ,</l>
     <l n="25">‘ Mid broken rocks , a rugged scene ,</l>
     <l n="26">With green and grassy dales between ,</l>
     <l n="27">‘ Mid forests dark of aged oak ,</l>
     <l n="28">Ne'er echoing with the woodman 's stroke ,</l>
     <l n="29">Where never human art appeared ,</l>
     <l n="30">Nor even one straw-roofed cot was reared ,</l>
     <l n="31">Where Nature seems to sit alone ,</l>
     <l n="32">Majestic on a craggy throne ;</l>
     <l n="33">Tell me the path , sweet wanderer , tell ,</l>
     <l n="34">To thy unknown sequestered cell ,</l>
     <l n="35">Where woodbines cluster round the door ,</l>
     <l n="36">Where shells and moss o'erlay the floor ,</l>
     <l n="37">And on whose top a hawthorn blows ,</l>
     <l n="38">Amid whose thickly-woven boughs</l>
     <l n="39">Some nightingale still builds her nest ,</l>
     <l n="40">Each evening warbling thee to rest :</l>
     <l n="41">Then lay me by the haunted stream ,</l>
     <l n="42">Rapt in some wild , poetic dream ,</l>
     <l n="43">In converse while methinks I rove</l>
     <l n="44">With Spenser through a fairy grove ;</l>
     <l n="45">Till , suddenly awaked , I hear</l>
     <l n="46">Strange whispered music in my ear ,</l>
     <l n="47">And my glad soul in bliss is drowned</l>
     <l n="48">By the sweetly-soothing sound !</l>
     <l n="49">Me , goddess , by the right hand lead</l>
     <l n="50">Sometimes through the yellow mead ,</l>
     <l n="51">Where Joy and white-robed Peace resort ,</l>
     <l n="52">And Venus keeps her festive court ;</l>
     <l n="53">Where Mirth and Youth each evening meet ,</l>
     <l n="54">And lightly trip with nimble feet ,</l>
     <l n="55">Nodding their lily-crowned heads ,</l>
     <l n="56">Where Laughter rose-lipped Hebe leads ;</l>
     <l n="57">Where Echo walks steep hills among ,</l>
     <l n="58">Listening to the shepherd 's song :</l>
     <l n="59">Yet not these flowery fields of joy</l>
     <l n="60">Can long my pensive mind employ ;</l>
     <l n="61">Haste , Fancy , from the scenes of folly ,</l>
     <l n="62">To meet the matron Melancholy ,</l>
     <l n="63">Goddess of the tearful eye ,</l>
     <l n="64">That loves to fold her arms , and sigh ;</l>
     <l n="65">Let us with silent footsteps go</l>
     <l n="66">To charnels and the house of woe ,</l>
     <l n="67">To Gothic churches , vaults , and tombs ,</l>
     <l n="68">Where each sad night some virgin comes ,</l>
     <l n="69">With throbbing breast , and faded cheek ,</l>
     <l n="70">Her promised bridegroom 's urn to seek ;</l>
     <l n="71">Or to some abbey 's mouldering towers ,</l>
     <l n="72">Where , to avoid cold wintry showers ,</l>
     <l n="73">The naked beggar shivering lies ,</l>
     <l n="74">While whistling tempests round her rise ,</l>
     <l n="75">And trembles lest the tottering wall</l>
     <l n="76">Should on her sleeping infants fall .</l>
     <l n="77">Now let us louder strike the lyre ,</l>
     <l n="78">For my heart glows with martial fire ,—</l>
     <l n="79">I feel , I feel , with sudden heat ,</l>
     <l n="80">My big tumultuous bosom beat ;</l>
     <l n="81">The trumpet 's clangours pierce my ear ,</l>
     <l n="82">A thousand widows ’ shrieks I hear ,</l>
     <l n="83">Give me another horse , I cry ,</l>
     <l n="84">Lo ! the base Gallic squadrons fly ;</l>
     <l n="85">Whence is this rage ?— what spirit , say ,</l>
     <l n="86">To battle hurries me away ?</l>
     <l n="87">‘ Tis Fancy , in her fiery car ,</l>
     <l n="88">Transports me to the thickest war ,</l>
     <l n="89">There whirls me o'er the hills of slain ,</l>
     <l n="90">Where Tumult and Destruction reign ;</l>
     <l n="91">Where , mad with pain , the wounded steed</l>
     <l n="92">Tramples the dying and the dead ;</l>
     <l n="93">Where giant Terror stalks around ,</l>
     <l n="94">With sullen joy surveys the ground ,</l>
     <l n="95">And , pointing to the ensanguined field ,</l>
     <l n="96">Shakes his dreadful gorgon shield !</l>
     <l n="97">Oh , guide me from this horrid scene ,</l>
     <l n="98">To high-arched walks and alleys green ,</l>
     <l n="99">Which lovely Laura seeks , to shun</l>
     <l n="100">The fervours of the mid-day sun ;</l>
     <l n="101">The pangs of absence , oh , remove !</l>
     <l n="102">For thou canst place me near my love ,</l>
     <l n="103">Canst fold in visionary bliss ,</l>
     <l n="104">And let me think I steal a kiss ,</l>
     <l n="105">While her ruby lips dispense</l>
     <l n="106">Luscious nectar 's quintessence !</l>
     <l n="107">When young-eyed Spring profusely throws</l>
     <l n="108">From her green lap the pink and rose ,</l>
     <l n="109">When the soft turtle of the dale</l>
     <l n="110">To Summer tells her tender tale ;</l>
     <l n="111">When Autumn cooling caverns seeks ,</l>
     <l n="112">And stains with wine his jolly cheeks ;</l>
     <l n="113">When Winter , like poor pilgrim old ,</l>
     <l n="114">Shakes his silver beard with cold ;</l>
     <l n="115">At every season let my ear</l>
     <l n="116">Thy solemn whispers , Fancy , hear .</l>
     <l n="117">O warm , enthusiastic maid ,</l>
     <l n="118">Without thy powerful , vital aid ,</l>
     <l n="119">That breathes an energy divine ,</l>
     <l n="120">That gives a soul to every line ,</l>
     <l n="121">Ne'er may I strive with lips profane</l>
     <l n="122">To utter an unhallowed strain ,</l>
     <l n="123">Nor dare to touch the sacred string ,</l>
     <l n="124">Save when with smiles thou bidst me sing .</l>
     <l n="125">Oh , hear our prayer ! oh , hither come</l>
     <l n="126">From thy lamented Shakspeare 's tomb ,</l>
     <l n="127">On which thou lovest to sit at eve ,</l>

     <l n="129">O queen of numbers , once again</l>
     <l n="130">Animate some chosen swain ,</l>
     <l n="131">Who , filled with unexhausted fire ,</l>
     <l n="132">May boldly smite the sounding lyre ,</l>
     <l n="133">Who with some new unequalled song</l>
     <l n="134">May rise above the rhyming throng ,</l>
     <l n="135">O'er all our listening passions reign ,</l>
     <l n="136">O'erwhelm our souls with joy and pain ,</l>
     <l n="137">With terror shake , and pity move ,</l>
     <l n="138">Rouse with revenge , or melt with love ;</l>
     <l n="139">Oh , deign to attend his evening walk ,</l>
     <l n="140">With him in groves and grottoes talk ;</l>
     <l n="141">Teach him to scorn with frigid art</l>
     <l n="142">Feebly to touch the enraptured heart ;</l>

     <l n="144">The bosom 's inmost foldings pierce ;</l>
