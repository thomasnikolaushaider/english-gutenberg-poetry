   <head>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</head>
   <p>Thomas Runciman was born in Northumberland in 1841 , and died in London in 1909 . He was the second son of Walter Runciman of Dunbar and Jean Finlay , his wife . In his youth he left the beautiful coast where his father was stationed to go to school and work in Newcastle . Artists of his name had been men of mark in Scotland , and as he had their strong feeling for colour he was allowed for a time to become a pupil of William Bell Scott , who was on the fringe of the Pre-Raphaelite Movement . Throughout his life he painted portraits and landscapes , but the latter were what he loved . His work was not widely known , for he had a nervous contempt for Exhibitions , and the first collection of his landscapes in water-colour and oil was opened to the public at a posthumous exhibition in Newcastle in 1911 . He travelled from time to time , and enjoyed living on the banks of the Seine , and in other beautiful regions abroad .</p>
   <p>His poems were never offered for publication , although critical essays of his appeared from time to time , as for instance in the “ London ” of Henley and Stevenson . The Songs and Sonnets were written for his own satisfaction , and were sent to a few faithful friends and to members of his own family , who have allowed me to collect and print them . The miscellaneous verses were in many instances found in letters , and others written in high spirits were rescued after his death from sketch books and scraps of paper by his daughter , Kate Runciman Sellers , and by his friend , Edward Nisbet .</p>

      <l n="5">I leave the drowsing south and in dreams I northward fly ,</l>
