    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">In offering this little book — the third of its kind — to the public , I am glad to take the opportunity of recording the pleasure I have received at the appreciation its predecessors have met with , as attested by their wide circulation , and by the universally kind notices of them from the Press . To have been the means of administering innocent mirth to thousands , may surely be a just motive for satisfaction , and an excuse for grateful expression .</p>
    <p n="2">At the same time , I am desirous of adding a few words as to the history of the two previously published volumes , and more particularly of the first or original “ Book of Nonsense , ” relating to which many absurd reports have crept into circulation , such as that it was the composition of the late Lord Brougham , the late Earl of Derby , etc . ; that the rhymes and pictures are by different persons ; or that the whole have a symbolical meaning , etc . ; whereas , every one of the Rhymes was composed by myself , and every one of the Illustrations drawn by my own hand at the time the verses were made . Moreover , in no portion of these Nonsense drawings have I ever allowed any caricature of private or public persons to appear , and throughout , more care than might be supposed has been given to make the subjects incapable of misinterpretation : “ Nonsense , ” pure and absolute , having been my aim throughout .</p>
    <p n="3">As for the persistently absurd report of the late Earl of Derby being the author of the “ First Book of Nonsense , ” I may relate an incident which occurred to me four summers ago , the first that gave me any insight into the origin of the rumor .</p>
    <p n="4">I was on my way from London to Guildford , in a railway carriage , containing , besides myself , one passenger , an elderly gentleman : presently , however , two ladies entered , accompanied by two little boys . These , who had just had a copy of the “ Book of Nonsense ” given them , were loud in their delight , and by degrees infected the whole party with their mirth .</p>
    <p n="5">“ How grateful , ” said the old gentleman to the two ladies , “ all children , and parents too , ought to be to the statesman who has given his time to composing that charming book ! ”</p>
    <p n="6">( The ladies looked puzzled , as indeed was I , the author . )</p>
    <p n="7">“ Do you not know who is the writer of it ? ” asked the gentleman .</p>
    <p n="8">“ The name is ‘ Edward Lear , ’ ” said one of the ladies .</p>
    <p n="9">“ Ah ! ” said the first speaker , “ so it is printed ; but that is only a whim of the real author , the Earl of Derby . ‘ Edward ’ is his Christian name , and , as you may see , LEAR is only EARL transposed . ”</p>
    <p n="10">“ But , ” said the lady , doubtingly , “ here is a dedication to the great-grandchildren , grand-nephews , and grand-nieces of Edward , thirteenth Earl of Derby , by the author , Edward Lear . ”</p>
    <p n="11">“ That , ” replied the other , “ is simply a piece of mystification ; I am in a position to know that the whole book was composed and illustrated by Lord Derby himself . In fact , there is no such a person at all as Edward Lear . ”</p>
    <p n="12">“ Yet , ” said the other lady , “ some friends of mine tell me they know Mr. Lear . ”</p>
    <p n="13">“ Quite a mistake ! completely a mistake ! ” said the old gentleman , becoming rather angry at the contradiction ; “ I am well aware of what I am saying : I can inform you , no such a person as ‘ Edward Lear ’ exists ! ”</p>
    <p n="14">Hitherto I had kept silence ; but as my hat was , as well as my handkerchief and stick , largely marked inside with my name , and as I happened to have in my pocket several letters addressed to me , the temptation was too great to resist ; so , flashing all these articles at once on my would-be extinguisher 's attention , I speedily reduced him to silence .</p>
    <p n="15">The second volume of Nonsense , commencing with the verses , “ The Owl and the Pussy-Cat , ” was written at different times , and for different sets of children : the whole being collected in the course of last year , were then illustrated , and published in a single volume , by Mr. R. J. Bush , of 32 Charing Cross .</p>
    <p n="16">The contents of the third or present volume were made also at different intervals in the last two years .</p>
    <p n="17">Long years ago , in days when much of my time was passed in a country house , where children and mirth abounded , the lines beginning , “ There was an old man of Tobago , ” were suggested to me by a valued friend , as a form of verse lending itself to limitless variety for rhymes and pictures ; and thenceforth the greater part of the original drawings and verses for the first “ Book of Nonsense ” were struck off with a pen , no assistance ever having been given me in any way but that of uproarious delight and welcome at the appearance of every new absurdity .</p>

    <docImprint>Most of these Drawings and Rhymes were transferred to lithographic stones in the year<date>1846</date>, and were then first published by Mr. Thomas McLean , of the Haymarket . But that edition having been soon exhausted , and the call for the “ Book of Nonsense ” continuing , I added a considerable number of subjects to those previously-published , and having caused the whole to be carefully reproduced in woodcuts by Messrs. Dalzell , I disposed of the copyright to Messrs. Routledge and Warne , by whom the volume was published in<date>1843</date>. EDWARD LEAR .
