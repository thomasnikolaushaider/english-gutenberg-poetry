     <head>APOLOGY</head>
     <p>About half the verses that follow were written quite lately . The rest are older , having been held over in MS. when past volumes were published , on considering that these would contain a sufficient number of pages to offer readers at one time , more especially during the distractions of the war . The unusually far back poems to be found here are , however , but some that were overlooked in gathering previous collections . A freshness in them , now unattainable , seemed to make up for their inexperience and to justify their inclusion . A few are dated ; the dates of others are not discoverable .</p>
     <p>The launching of a volume of this kind in neo-Georgian days by one who began writing in mid-Victorian , and has published nothing to speak of for some years , may seem to call for a few words of excuse or explanation . Whether or no , readers may feel assured that a new book is submitted to them with great hesitation at so belated a date . Insistent practical reasons , however , among which were requests from some illustrious men of letters who are in sympathy with my productions , the accident that several of the poems have already seen the light , and that dozens of them have been lying about for years , compelled the course adopted , in spite of the natural disinclination of a writer whose works have been so frequently regarded askance by a pragmatic section here and there , to draw attention to them once more .</p>
     <p>I do not know that it is necessary to say much on the contents of the book , even in deference to suggestions that will be mentioned presently . I believe that those readers who care for my poems at all — readers to whom no passport is required — will care for this new instalment of them , perhaps the last , as much as for any that have preceded them . Moreover , in the eyes of a less friendly class the pieces , though a very mixed collection indeed , contain , so far as I am able to see , little or nothing in technic or teaching that can be considered a Star-Chamber matter , or so much as agitating to a ladies ’ school ; even though , to use Wordsworth 's observation in his Preface to Lyrical Ballads , such readers may suppose “ that by the act of writing in verse an author makes a formal engagement that he will gratify certain known habits of association : that he not only thus apprises the reader that certain classes of ideas and expressions will be found in his book , but that others will be carefully excluded . ”</p>
     <p>It is true , nevertheless , that some grave , positive , stark , delineations are interspersed among those of the passive , lighter , and traditional sort presumably nearer to stereotyped tastes . For — while I am quite aware that a thinker is not expected , and , indeed , is scarcely allowed , now more than heretofore , to state all that crosses his mind concerning existence in this universe , in his attempts to explain or excuse the presence of evil and the incongruity of penalizing the irresponsible — it must be obvious to open intelligences that , without denying the beauty and faithful service of certain venerable cults , such disallowance of “ obstinate questionings ” and “ blank misgivings ” tends to a paralysed intellectual stalemate . Heine observed nearly a hundred years ago that the soul has her eternal rights ; that she will not be darkened by statutes , nor lullabied by the music of bells . And what is to - day , in allusions to the present author 's pages , alleged to be “ pessimism ” is , in truth , only such “ questionings ” in the exploration of reality , and is the first step towards the soul 's betterment , and the body 's also .</p>
     <p>If I may be forgiven for quoting my own old words , let me repeat what I printed in this relation more than twenty years ago , and wrote much earlier , in a poem entitled “ In Tenebris ":</p>
     <p>If way to the Better there be , it exacts a full look at the Worst :</p>
     <p>that is to say , by the exploration of reality , and its frank recognition stage by stage along the survey , with an eye to the best consummation possible : briefly , evolutionary meliorism . But it is called pessimism nevertheless ; under which word , expressed with condemnatory emphasis , it is regarded by many as some pernicious new thing ( though so old as to underlie the Christian idea , and even to permeate the Greek drama ) ; and the subject is charitably left to decent silence , as if further comment were needless .</p>
     <p>Happily there are some who feel such Levitical passing-by to be , alas , by no means a permanent dismissal of the matter ; that comment on where the world stands is very much the reverse of needless in these disordered years of our prematurely afflicted century : that amendment and not madness lies that way . And looking down the future these few hold fast to the same : that whether the human and kindred animal races survive till the exhaustion or destruction of the globe , or whether these races perish and are succeeded by others before that conclusion comes , pain to all upon it , tongued or dumb , shall be kept down to a minimum by lovingkindness , operating through scientific knowledge , and actuated by the modicum of free will conjecturally possessed by organic life when the mighty necessitating forces — unconscious or other — that have “ the balancings of the clouds , ” happen to be in equilibrium , which may or may not be often .</p>
     <p>To conclude this question I may add that the argument of the so - called optimists is neatly summarized in a stern pronouncement against me by my friend Mr. Frederic Harrison in a late essay of his , in the words : “ This view of life is not mine . ” The solemn declaration does not seem to me to be so annihilating to the said “ view ” ( really a series of fugitive impressions which I have never tried to co-ordinate ) as is complacently assumed . Surely it embodies a too human fallacy quite familiar in logic . Next , a knowing reviewer , apparently a Roman Catholic young man , speaks , with some rather gross instances of the suggestio falsi in his article , of “ Mr. Hardy refusing consolation , ” the “ dark gravity of his ideas , ” and so on . When a Positivist and a Catholic agree there must be something wonderful in it , which should make a poet sit up . But . . . O that ‘ twere possible !</p>
     <p>I would not have alluded in this place or anywhere else to such casual personal criticisms — for casual and unreflecting they must be - - but for the satisfaction of two or three friends in whose opinion a short answer was deemed desirable , on account of the continual repetition of these criticisms , or more precisely , quizzings . After all , the serious and truly literary inquiry in this connection is : Should a shaper of such stuff as dreams are made on disregard considerations of what is customary and expected , and apply himself to the real function of poetry , the application of ideas to life ( in Matthew Arnold 's familiar phrase ) ? This bears more particularly on what has been called the “ philosophy ” of these poems — usually reproved as “ queer . ” Whoever the author may be that undertakes such application of ideas in this “ philosophic ” direction — where it is specially required — glacial judgments must inevitably fall upon him amid opinion whose arbiters largely decry individuality , to whom IDEAS are oddities to smile at , who are moved by a yearning the reverse of that of the Athenian inquirers on Mars Hill ; and stiffen their features not only at sound of a new thing , but at a restatement of old things in new terms . Hence should anything of this sort in the following adumbrations seem “ queer “ — should any of them seem to good Panglossians to embody strange and disrespectful conceptions of this best of all possible worlds , I apologize ; but cannot help it .</p>
     <p>Such divergences , which , though piquant for the nonce , it would be affectation to say are not saddening and discouraging likewise , may , to be sure , arise sometimes from superficial aspect only , writer and reader seeing the same thing at different angles . But in palpable cases of divergence they arise , as already said , whenever a serious effort is made towards that which the authority I have cited — who would now be called old-fashioned , possibly even parochial — affirmed to be what no good critic could deny as the poet 's province , the application of ideas to life . One might shrewdly guess , by the by , that in such recommendation the famous writer may have overlooked the cold-shouldering results upon an enthusiastic disciple that would be pretty certain to follow his putting the high aim in practice , and have forgotten the disconcerting experience of Gil Blas with the Archbishop .</p>
     <p>To add a few more words to what has already taken up too many , there is a contingency liable to miscellanies of verse that I have never seen mentioned , so far as I can remember ; I mean the chance little shocks that may be caused over a book of various character like the present and its predecessors by the juxtaposition of unrelated , even discordant , effusions ; poems perhaps years apart in the making , yet facing each other . An odd result of this has been that dramatic anecdotes of a satirical and humorous intention ( such , e. g ., as “ Royal Sponsors ” ) following verse in graver voice , have been read as misfires because they raise the smile that they were intended to raise , the journalist , deaf to the sudden change of key , being unconscious that he is laughing with the author and not at him . I admit that I did not foresee such contingencies as I ought to have done , and that people might not perceive when the tone altered . But the difficulties of arranging the themes in a graduated kinship of moods would have been so great that irrelation was almost unavoidable with efforts so diverse . I must trust for right note-catching to those finely-touched spirits who can divine without half a whisper , whose intuitiveness is proof against all the accidents of inconsequence . In respect of the less alert , however , should any one 's train of thought be thrown out of gear by a consecutive piping of vocal reeds in jarring tonics , without a semiquaver 's rest between , and be led thereby to miss the writer 's aim and meaning in one out of two contiguous compositions , I shall deeply regret it .</p>
     <p>Having at last , I think , finished with the personal points that I was recommended to notice , I will forsake the immediate object of this Preface ; and , leaving Late Lyrics to whatever fate it deserves , digress for a few moments to more general considerations . The thoughts of any man of letters concerned to keep poetry alive cannot but run uncomfortably on the precarious prospects of English verse at the present day . Verily the hazards and casualties surrounding the birth and setting forth of almost every modern creation in numbers are ominously like those of one of Shelley 's paper-boats on a windy lake . And a forward conjecture scarcely permits the hope of a better time , unless men 's tendencies should change . So indeed of all art , literature , and “ high thinking ” nowadays . Whether owing to the barbarizing of taste in the younger minds by the dark madness of the late war , the unabashed cultivation of selfishness in all classes , the plethoric growth of knowledge simultaneously with the stunting of wisdom , “ a degrading thirst after outrageous stimulation ” ( to quote Wordsworth again ) , or from any other cause , we seem threatened with a new Dark Age .</p>
     <p>I formerly thought , like so many roughly handled writers , that so far as literature was concerned a partial cause might be impotent or mischievous criticism ; the satirizing of individuality , the lack of whole-seeing in contemporary estimates of poetry and kindred work , the knowingness affected by junior reviewers , the overgrowth of meticulousness in their peerings for an opinion , as if it were a cultivated habit in them to scrutinize the tool-marks and be blind to the building , to hearken for the key-creaks and be deaf to the diapason , to judge the landscape by a nocturnal exploration with a flash-lantern . In other words , to carry on the old game of sampling the poem or drama by quoting the worst line or worst passage only , in ignorance or not of Coleridge 's proof that a versification of any length neither can be nor ought to be all poetry ; of reading meanings into a book that its author never dreamt of writing there . I might go on interminably .</p>
     <p>But I do not now think any such temporary obstructions to be the cause of the hazard , for these negligences and ignorances , though they may have stifled a few true poets in the run of generations , disperse like stricken leaves before the wind of next week , and are no more heard of again in the region of letters than their writers themselves . No : we may be convinced that something of the deeper sort mentioned must be the cause .</p>
     <p>In any event poetry , pure literature in general , religion — I include religion because poetry and religion touch each other , or rather modulate into each other ; are , indeed , often but different names for the same thing — these , I say , the visible signs of mental and emotional life , must like all other things keep moving , becoming ; even though at present , when belief in witches of Endor is displacing the Darwinian theory and “ the truth that shall make you free , men 's minds appear , as above noted , to be moving backwards rather than on . I speak , of course , somewhat sweepingly , and should except many isolated minds ; also the minds of men in certain worthy but small bodies of various denominations , and perhaps in the homely quarter where advance might have been the very least expected a few years back — the English Church — if one reads it rightly as showing evidence of “ removing those things that are shaken , ” in accordance with the wise Epistolary recommendation to the Hebrews . For since the historic and once august hierarchy of Rome some generation ago lost its chance of being the religion of the future by doing otherwise , and throwing over the little band of neo-Catholics who were making a struggle for continuity by applying the principle of evolution to their own faith , joining hands with modern science , and outflanking the hesitating English instinct towards liturgical reform ( a flank march which I at the time quite expected to witness , with the gathering of many millions of waiting agnostics into its fold ) ; since then , one may ask , what other purely English establishment than the Church , of sufficient dignity and footing , and with such strength of old association , such architectural spell , is left in this country to keep the shreds of morality together ?</p>
     <p>It may be a forlorn hope , a mere dream , that of an alliance between religion , which must be retained unless the world is to perish , and complete rationality , which must come , unless also the world is to perish , by means of the interfusing effect of poetry — “ the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge ; the impassioned expression of science , ” as it was defined by an English poet who was quite orthodox in his ideas . But if it be true , as Comte argued , that advance is never in a straight line , but in a looped orbit , we may , in the aforesaid ominous moving backward , be doing it pour mieux sauter , drawing back for a spring . I repeat that I forlornly hope so , notwithstanding the supercilious regard of hope by Schopenhauer , von Hartmann , and other philosophers down to Einstein who have my respect . But one dares not prophesy . Physical , chronological , and other contingencies keep me in these days from critical studies and literary circles</p>

     <p>( if one may quote Tennyson in this century of free verse ) . Hence I cannot know how things are going so well as I used to know them , and the aforesaid limitations must quite prevent my knowing hence - forward .</p>
     <p>I have to thank the editors and owners of The Times , Fortnightly , Mercury , and other periodicals in which a few of the poems have appeared for kindly assenting to their being reclaimed for collected publication . T. H .</p>
