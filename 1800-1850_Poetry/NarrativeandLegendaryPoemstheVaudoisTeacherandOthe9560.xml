    <docImprint>PUBLISHERS ’ ADVERTISEMENT The Standard Library Edition of Mr. Whittier 's writings comprises his poetical and prose works as re-arranged and thoroughly revised by himself or with his cooperation . Mr. Whittier has supplied such additional information regarding the subject and occasion of certain poems as may be stated in brief head-notes , and this edition has been much enriched by the poet 's personal comment . So far as practicable the dates of publication of the various articles have been given , and since these were originally published soon after composition , the dates of their first appearance have been taken as determining the time at which they were written . At the request of the Publishers , Mr. Whittier has allowed his early poems , discarded from previous collections , to be placed , in the general order of their appearance , in an appendix to the final volume of poems . By this means the present edition is made so complete and retrospective that students of the poet 's career will always find the most abundant material for their purpose . The Publishers congratulate themselves and the public that the careful attention which Mr. Whittier has been able to give to this revision of his works has resulted in so comprehensive and well-adjusted a collection . The portraits prefixed to the several volumes have been chosen with a view to illustrating successive periods in the poet 's life . The original sources and dates are indicated in each case .</docImprint>

    <docImprint>NOTE. - The portrait prefixed to this volume was etched by S. A. Schoff , in<date>1888</date>, after a painting by Bass Otis , a pupil of Gilbert Stuart , made in the winter of<date>1836-1837</date>. PROEM I LOVE the old melodious lays Which softly melt the ages through , The songs of Spenser 's golden days , Arcadian Sidney 's silvery phrase , Sprinkling our noon of time with freshest morning dew . Yet , vainly in my quiet hours To breathe their marvellous notes I try ; I feel them , as the leaves and flowers In silence feel the dewy showers , And drink with glad , still lips the blessing of the sky . The rigor of a frozen clime , The harshness of an untaught ear , The jarring words of one whose rhyme Beat often Labor 's hurried time , Or Duty 's rugged march through storm and strife , are here . Of mystic beauty , dreamy grace , No rounded art the lack supplies ; Unskilled the subtle lines to trace , Or softer shades of Nature 's face , I view her common forms with unanointed eyes . Nor mine the seer-like power to show The secrets of the heart and mind ; To drop the plummet-line below Our common world of joy and woe , A more intense despair or brighter hope to find . Yet here at least an earnest sense Of human right and weal is shown ; A hate of tyranny intense , And hearty in its vehemence , As if my brother 's pain and sorrow were my own . O Freedom ! if to me belong Nor mighty Milton 's gift divine , Nor Marvell 's wit and graceful song , Still with a love as deep and strong As theirs , I lay , like them , my best gifts on thy shrine .

    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">The edition of my poems published in 1857 contained the following note by way of preface :—</p>
    <p n="2">“ In these volumes , for the first time , a complete collection of my poetical writings has been made . While it is satisfactory to know that these scattered children of my brain have found a home , I cannot but regret that I have been unable , by reason of illness , to give that attention to their revision and arrangement , which respect for the opinions of others and my own afterthought and experience demand .</p>
    <p n="3">“ That there are pieces in this collection which I would ‘ willingly let die , ’ I am free to confess . But it is now too late to disown them , and I must submit to the inevitable penalty of poetical as well as other sins . There are others , intimately connected with the author 's life and times , which owe their tenacity of vitality to the circumstances under which they were written , and the events by which they were suggested .</p>
    <p n="4">“ The long poem of Mogg Megone was in a great measure composed in early life ; and it is scarcely necessary to say that its subject is not such as the writer would have chosen at any subsequent period . ”</p>
   </div>
   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>After a lapse of thirty years since the above was written , I have been requested by my publishers to make some preparation for a new and revised edition of my poems . I cannot flatter myself that I have added much to the interest of the work beyond the correction of my own errors and those of the press , with the addition of a few heretofore unpublished pieces , and occasional notes of explanation which seemed necessary . I have made an attempt to classify the poems under a few general heads , and have transferred the long poem of Mogg Megone to the Appendix , with other specimens of my earlier writings . I have endeavored to affix the dates of composition or publication as far as possible . In looking over these poems I have not been unmindful of occasional prosaic lines and verbal infelicities , but at this late day I have neither strength nor patience to undertake their correction . Perhaps a word of explanation may be needed in regard to a class of poems written between the years<date>1832</date>and<date>1865</date>. Of their defects from an artistic point of view it is not necessary to speak . They were the earnest and often vehement expression of the writer 's thought and feeling at critical periods in the great conflict between Freedom and Slavery . They were written with no expectation that they would survive the occasions which called them forth : they were protests , alarm signals , trumpet-calls to action , words wrung from the writer 's heart , forged at white heat , and of course lacking the finish and careful word-selection which reflection and patient brooding over them might have given . Such as they are , they belong to the history of the Anti-Slavery movement , and may serve as way-marks of its progress . If their language at times seems severe and harsh , the monstrous wrong of Slavery which provoked it must be its excuse , if any is needed . In attacking it , we did not measure our words . “ It is , ” said Garrison , “ a waste of politeness to be courteous to the devil . ” But in truth the contest was , in a great measure , an impersonal one ,— hatred of slavery and not of slave-masters .</docImprint>
    <epigraph>
     <p>“ No common wrong provoked our zeal , The silken gauntlet which is thrown In such a quarrel rings like steel . ” Even Thomas Jefferson , in his terrible denunciation of Slavery in the Notes on Virginia , says “ It is impossible to be temperate and pursue the subject of Slavery . ” After the great contest was over , no class of the American people were more ready , with kind words and deprecation of harsh retaliation , to welcome back the revolted States than the Abolitionists ; and none have since more heartily rejoiced at the fast increasing prosperity of the South . Grateful for the measure of favor which has been accorded to my writings , I leave this edition with the public . It contains all that I care to re-publish , and some things which , had the matter of choice been left solely to myself , I should have omitted . J. G. W .</p>

   <p>This poem was suggested by the account given of the manner which the Waldenses disseminated their principles among the Catholic gentry . They gained access to the house through their occupation as peddlers of silks , jewels , and trinkets . “ Having disposed of some of their goods , ” it is said by a writer who quotes the inquisitor Rainerus Sacco , “ they cautiously intimated that they had commodities far more valuable than these , inestimable jewels , which they would show if they could be protected from the clergy . They would then give their purchasers a Bible or Testament ; and thereby many were deluded into heresy . ” The poem , under the title Le Colporteur Vaudois , was translated into French by Professor G. de Felice , of Montauban , and further naturalized by Professor Alexandre Rodolphe Vinet , who quoted it in his lectures on French literature , afterwards published . It became familiar in this form to the Waldenses , who adopted it as a household poem . An American clergyman , J. C. Fletcher , frequently heard it when he was a student , about the year 1850 , in the theological seminary at Geneva , Switzerland , but the authorship of the poem was unknown to those who used it . Twenty-five years later , Mr. Fletcher , learning the name of the author , wrote to the moderator of the Waldensian synod at La Tour , giving the information . At the banquet which closed the meeting of the synod , the moderator announced the fact , and was instructed in the name of the Waldensian church to write to me a letter of thanks . My letter , written in reply , was translated into Italian and printed throughout Italy .</p>
   <p>“ O LADY fair , these silks of mine are beautiful and rare ,— The richest web of the Indian loom , which beauty 's queen might wear ; And my pearls are pure as thy own fair neck , with whose radiant light they vie ; I have brought them with me a weary way ,— will my gentle lady buy ? ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The lady smiled on the worn old man through the</l>
     <l n="2">dark and clustering curls</l>
     <l n="3">Which veiled her brow , as she bent to view his</l>
     <l n="4">silks and glittering pearls ;</l>
     <l n="5">And she placed their price in the old man 's hand</l>
     <l n="6">and lightly turned away ,</l>
     <l n="7">But she paused at the wanderer 's earnest call ,—</l>
     <l n="8">“ My gentle lady , stay !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ O lady fair , I have yet a gem which a purer lustre flings , Than the diamond flash of the jewelled crown on the lofty brow of kings ; A wonderful pearl of exceeding price , whose virtue shall not decay , Whose light shall be as a spell to thee and a blessing on thy way ! ”</p>
   <p>The lady glanced at the mirroring steel where her form of grace was seen , Where her eye shone clear , and her dark locks waved their clasping pearls between ; “ Bring forth thy pearl of exceeding worth , thou traveller gray and old , And name the price of thy precious gem , and my page shall count thy gold . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The cloud went off from the pilgrim 's brow , as a</l>
     <l n="2">small and meagre book ,</l>
     <l n="3">Unchased with gold or gem of cost , from his</l>
     <l n="4">folding robe he took !</l>
     <l n="5">“ Here , lady fair , is the pearl of price , may it prove</l>
     <l n="6">as such to thee</l>
     <l n="7">Nay , keep thy gold — I ask it not , for the word of</l>
     <l n="8">God is free ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The hoary traveller went his way , but the gift he left behind Hath had its pure and perfect work on that high - born maiden 's mind , And she hath turned from the pride of sin to the lowliness of truth , And given her human heart to God in its beautiful hour of youth</p>
   <p>And she hath left the gray old halls , where an evil faith had power , The courtly knights of her father 's train , and the maidens of her bower ; And she hath gone to the Vaudois vales by lordly feet untrod , Where the poor and needy of earth are rich in the perfect love of God ! 1830 .</p>

    <head>THE FEMALE MARTYR .</head>
    <head>Mary G —— -  , aged eighteen , a “ Sister of Charity , ” died in one of our Atlantic cities , during the prevalence of the Indian cholera , while in voluntary attendance upon the sick .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ BRING out your dead ! ” The midnight street</l>
     <l n="2">Heard and gave back the hoarse , low call ;</l>
     <l n="3">Harsh fell the tread of hasty feet ,</l>
     <l n="4">Glanced through the dark the coarse white sheet ,</l>
     <l n="5">Her coffin and her pall .</l>
     <l n="6">“ What — only one ! ” the brutal hack-man said ,</l>
     <l n="7">As , with an oath , he spurned away the dead .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">How sunk the inmost hearts of all ,</l>
     <l n="9">As rolled that dead-cart slowly by ,</l>
     <l n="10">With creaking wheel and harsh hoof-fall !</l>
     <l n="11">The dying turned him to the wall ,</l>
     <l n="12">To hear it and to die !</l>
     <l n="13">Onward it rolled ; while oft its driver stayed ,</l>
     <l n="14">And hoarsely clamored , “ Ho ! bring out your dead . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">It paused beside the burial-place ;</l>
     <l n="16">“ Toss in your load ! ” and it was done .</l>
     <l n="17">With quick hand and averted face ,</l>
     <l n="18">Hastily to the grave 's embrace</l>
     <l n="19">They cast them , one by one ,</l>
     <l n="20">Stranger and friend , the evil and the just ,</l>
     <l n="21">Together trodden in the churchyard dust .</l>

     <l n="25">Rose through the damp and noisome air ,</l>
     <l n="26">Giving thee to thy God ;</l>

     <l n="33">Thy sisterhood were kneeling ,</l>
     <l n="34">At vesper hours , like sorrowing angels , keeping</l>

     <l n="39">Through weary day and wakeful night ,</l>
     <l n="40">Far more than words may tell</l>

    <head>PENTUCKET .</head>
    <head>The village of Haverhill , on the Merrimac , called by the Indians Pentucket , was for nearly seventeen years a frontier town , and during thirty years endured all the horrors of savage warfare . In the year 1708 , a combined body of French and Indians , under the command of De Chaillons , and Hertel de Rouville , the famous and bloody sacker of Deerfield , made an attack upon the village , which at that time contained only thirty houses . Sixteen of the villagers were massacred , and a still larger number made prisoners . About thirty of the enemy also fell , among them Hertel de Rouville . The minister of the place , Benjamin Rolfe , was killed by a shot through his own door . In a paper entitled The Border War of 1708 , published in my collection of Recreations and Miscellanies , I have given a prose narrative of the surprise of Haverhill .</head>

    <head>THE NORSEMEN .</head>
    <head>In the early part of the present century , a fragment of a statue , rudely chiselled from dark gray stone , was found in the town of Bradford , on the Merrimac . Its origin must be left entirely to conjecture . The fact that the ancient Northmen visited the north-east coast of North America and probably New England , some centuries before the discovery of the western world by Columbus , is very generally admitted .</head>

    <head>FUNERAL TREE OF THE SOKOKIS .</head>
    <head>Polan , chief of the Sokokis Indians of the country between Agamenticus and Casco Bay , was killed at Windham on Sebago Lake in the spring of 1756 . After the whites had retired , the surviving Indians “ swayed ” or bent down a young tree until its roots were upturned , placed the body of their chief beneath it , then released the tree , which , in springing back to its old position , covered the grave . The Sokokis were early converts to the Catholic faith . Most of them , prior to the year 1756 , had removed to the French settlements on the St. Francois .</head>

    <head>ST. JOHN .</head>
    <head>The fierce rivalry between Charles de La Tour , a Protestant , and D'Aulnay Charnasy , a Catholic , for the possession of Acadia , forms one of the most romantic passages in the history of the New World . La Tour received aid in several instances from the Puritan colony of Massachusetts . During one of his voyages for the purpose of obtaining arms and provisions for his establishment at St. John , his castle was attacked by D'Aulnay , and successfully defended by its high-spirited mistress . A second attack however followed in the fourth month , 1647 , when D'Aulnay was successful , and the garrison was put to the sword . Lady La Tour languished a few days in the hands of her enemy , and then died of grief .</head>

   <p>CASSANDRA SOUTHWICK . In 1658 two young persons , son and daughter of Lawrence Smithwick of Salem , who had himself been imprisoned and deprived of nearly all his property for having entertained Quakers at his house , were fined for non-attendance at church . They being unable to pay the fine , the General Court issued an order empowering “ the Treasurer of the County to sell the said persons to any of the English nation of Virginia or Barbadoes , to answer said fines . ” An attempt was made to carry this order into execution , but no shipmaster was found willing to convey them to the West Indies .</p>

     <l n="9">Last night I saw the sunset melt through my prison</l>
     <l n="10">bars ,</l>
     <l n="11">Last night across my damp earth-floor fell the pale</l>

     <l n="13">In the coldness and the darkness all through the</l>

     <l n="15">My grated casement whitened with autumn 's early</l>

     <l n="17">Alone , in that dark sorrow , hour after hour crept</l>
     <l n="18">by ;</l>
     <l n="19">Star after star looked palely in and sank adown</l>

     <l n="21">No sound amid night 's stillness , save that which</l>
     <l n="22">seemed to be</l>
     <l n="23">The dull and heavy beating of the pulses of the sea ;</l>
   </lg>
   <p>All night I sat unsleeping , for I knew that on the morrow The ruler and the cruel priest would mock me in my sorrow , Dragged to their place of market , and bargained for and sold , Like a lamb before the shambles , like a heifer from the fold !</p>
   <p>Oh , the weakness of the flesh was there , the shrinking and the shame ; And the low voice of the Tempter like whispers to me came : “ Why sit'st thou thus forlornly , ” the wicked murmur said , “ Damp walls thy bower of beauty , cold earth thy maiden bed ?</p>

     <l n="1">“ O weak , deluded maiden !— by crazy fancies</l>

   </lg>
   <p>Oh , ever as the Tempter spoke , and feeble Nature 's fears Wrung drop by drop the scalding flow of unavailing tears , I wrestled down the evil thoughts , and strove in silent prayer , To feel , O Helper of the weak ! that Thou indeed wert there !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">I thought of Paul and Silas , within Philippi 's cell ,</l>
     <l n="2">And how from Peter 's sleeping limbs the prison</l>
     <l n="3">shackles fell ,</l>
     <l n="4">Till I seemed to hear the trailing of an angel 's</l>
     <l n="5">robe of white ,</l>
     <l n="6">And to feel a blessed presence invisible to sight .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Bless the Lord for all his mercies !— for the peace and love I felt , Like dew of Hermon 's holy hill , upon my spirit melt ; When “ Get behind me , Satan ! ” was the language of my heart , And I felt the Evil Tempter with all his doubts depart .</p>
   <p>Slow broke the gray cold morning ; again the sunshine fell , Flecked with the shade of bar and grate within my lonely cell ; The hoar-frost melted on the wall , and upward from the street Came careless laugh and idle word , and tread of passing feet .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">At length the heavy bolts fell back , my door was</l>
     <l n="2">open cast ,</l>
     <l n="3">And slowly at the sheriff 's side , up the long street</l>
     <l n="4">I passed ;</l>
     <l n="5">I heard the murmur round me , and felt , but dared</l>
     <l n="6">not see ,</l>
     <l n="7">How , from every door and window , the people</l>
     <l n="8">gazed on me .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And doubt and fear fell on me , shame burned upon my cheek , Swam earth and sky around me , my trembling limbs grew weak : “ O Lord ! support thy handmaid ; and from her soul cast out The fear of man , which brings a snare , the weakness and the doubt . ”</p>
   <p>Then the dreary shadows scattered , like a cloud in morning 's breeze , And a low deep voice within me seemed whispering words like these : “ Though thy earth be as the iron , and thy heaven a brazen wall , Trust still His loving-kindness whose power is over all . ”</p>
   <p>We paused at length , where at my feet the sunlit waters broke On glaring reach of shining beach , and shingly wall of rock ; The merchant-ships lay idly there , in hard clear lines on high , Tracing with rope and slender spar their network on the sky .</p>
   <p>And there were ancient citizens , cloak-wrapped and grave and cold , And grim and stout sea-captains with faces bronzed and old , And on his horse , with Rawson , his cruel clerk at hand , Sat dark and haughty Endicott , the ruler of the land .</p>
   <p>And poisoning with his evil words the ruler 's ready ear , The priest leaned o'er his saddle , with laugh and scoff and jeer ; It stirred my soul , and from my lips the seal of silence broke , As if through woman 's weakness a warning spirit spoke .</p>
   <p>I cried , “ The Lord rebuke thee , thou smiter of the meek , Thou robber of the righteous , thou trampler of the weak ! Go light the dark , cold hearth-stones ,— go turn the prison lock Of the poor hearts thou hast hunted , thou wolf amid the flock ! ”</p>
   <p>Dark lowered the brows of Endicott , and with a deeper red O'er Rawson 's wine-empurpled cheek the flush of anger spread ; “ Good people , ” quoth the white-lipped priest , “ heed not her words so wild , Her Master speaks within her ,— the Devil owns his child ! ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">But gray heads shook , and young brows knit , the</l>
     <l n="2">while the sheriff read</l>
     <l n="3">That law the wicked rulers against the poor have</l>
     <l n="4">made ,</l>
     <l n="5">Who to their house of Rimmon and idol priesthood</l>
     <l n="6">bring</l>
     <l n="7">No bended knee of worship , nor gainful offering .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">Then to the stout sea-captains the sheriff , turning ,</l>
     <l n="9">said ,—</l>
     <l n="10">“ Which of ye , worthy seamen , will take this</l>
     <l n="11">Quaker maid ?</l>
     <l n="12">In the Isle of fair Barbadoes , or on Virginia 's</l>
     <l n="13">shore ,</l>
     <l n="14">You may hold her at a higher price than Indian</l>
     <l n="15">girl or Moor . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Grim and silent stood the captains ; and when again he cried , “ Speak out , my worthy seamen ! ” — no voice , no sign replied ; But I felt a hard hand press my own , and kind words met my ear ,— “ God bless thee , and preserve thee , my gentle girl and dear ! ”</p>
   <p>A weight seemed lifted from my heart , a pitying friend was nigh ,— I felt it in his hard , rough hand , and saw it in his eye ; And when again the sheriff spoke , that voice , so kind to me , Growled back its stormy answer like the roaring of the sea ,—</p>
   <p>“ Pile my ship with bars of silver , pack with coins of Spanish gold , From keel-piece up to deck-plank , the roomage of her hold , By the living God who made me !— I would sooner in your bay Sink ship and crew and cargo , than bear this child away ! ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Well answered , worthy captain , shame on their</l>
     <l n="2">cruel laws ! ”</l>
     <l n="3">Ran through the crowd in murmurs loud the people 's</l>
     <l n="4">just applause .</l>
     <l n="5">“ Like the herdsman of Tekoa , in Israel of old ,</l>
     <l n="6">Shall we see the poor and righteous again for</l>
     <l n="7">silver sold ? ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I looked on haughty Endicott ; with weapon half - way drawn , Swept round the throng his lion glare of bitter hate and scorn ; Fiercely he drew his bridle-rein , and turned in silence back , And sneering priest and baffled clerk rode murmuring in his track .</p>
   <p>Hard after them the sheriff looked , in bitterness of soul ; Thrice smote his staff upon the ground , and crushed his parchment roll . “ Good friends , ” he said , “ since both have fled , the ruler and the priest , Judge ye , if from their further work I be not well released . ”</p>
   <p>Loud was the cheer which , full and clear , swept round the silent bay , As , with kind words and kinder looks , he bade me go my way ; For He who turns the courses of the streamlet of the glen , And the river of great waters , had turned the hearts of men .</p>
   <p>Oh , at that hour the very earth seemed changed beneath my eye , A holier wonder round me rose the blue walls of the sky , A lovelier light on rock and hill and stream and woodland lay , And softer lapsed on sunnier sands the waters of the bay .</p>
   <p>Thanksgiving to the Lord of life ! to Him all praises be , Who from the hands of evil men hath set his hand - maid free ; All praise to Him before whose power the mighty are afraid , Who takes the crafty in the snare which for the poor is laid !</p>
   <p>Sing , O my soul , rejoicingly , on evening 's twilight calm Uplift the loud thanksgiving , pour forth the grateful psalm ; Let all dear hearts with me rejoice , as did the saints of old , When of the Lord 's good angel the rescued Peter told .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And weep and howl , ye evil priests and mighty</l>
     <l n="2">men of wrong ,</l>
     <l n="3">The Lord shall smite the proud , and lay His hand</l>
     <l n="4">upon the strong .</l>
     <l n="5">Woe to the wicked rulers in His avenging hour !</l>
     <l n="6">Woe to the wolves who seek the flocks to raven</l>
     <l n="7">and devour !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But let the humble ones arise , the poor in heart be glad , And let the mourning ones again with robes of praise be clad . For He who cooled the furnace , and smoothed the stormy wave , And tamed the Chaldean lions , is mighty still to save ! 1843 .</p>
