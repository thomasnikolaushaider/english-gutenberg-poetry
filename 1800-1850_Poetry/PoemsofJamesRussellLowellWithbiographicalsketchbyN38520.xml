    <docTitle><titlePart>JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL . BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>In the year<date>1639</date>Percival Lowle , or Lowell , a merchant of Bristol ,<country>England</country>, landed at the little seaport town of Newbury , Mass . We generally speak of a man 's descent . In the case of James Russell Lowell 's ancestry it was rather an ascent through eight generations . Percival Lowle 's son , John Lowell , was a worthy cooper in old Newbury ; his great-grandson was a shoemaker , his great-great-grandson was the Rev . John Lowell of Newburyport , the father of the Hon . John Lowell , who is regarded as the author of the clause in the Massachusetts Constitution abolishing slavery . Judge Lowell 's son , Charles , was a Unitarian minister , “ learned , saintly , and discreet . ” He married Miss Harriet Traill Spence , of Portsmouth ,— a woman of superior mind , of great wit , vivacity , and an impetuosity that reached eccentricity . She was of Keltic blood , of a family that came from the Orkneys , and claimed descent from the Sir Patrick Spens of “ the grand old ballad . ” Several of her family were connected with the American navy . Her father was Keith Spence , purser of the frigate “<settlement>Philadelphia</settlement>, ” and a prisoner at Tripoli .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>By ancestry on both sides , and by connections with the Russells and other distinguished families , Lowell was a good type of the New England gentleman .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>He was born on the 22d of February ,<date>1819</date>, at Elmwood , not far from Brattle Street ,<settlement>Cambridge</settlement>. This three-storied colonial mansion of wood , was built in<date>1767</date>by Thomas Oliver , the last royal Lieutenant-Governor , before the Revolution .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Like other houses in “ Tory Row , ” it was abandoned by its owners . Soon afterwards it came into possession of Elbridge Gerry , Governor of Massachusetts , and fifth Vice-President of the<country>United States</country>, whose memory and name are kept alive by the term “ gerrymander . ” It next became the property of Dr. Lowell about a year before the birth of his youngest child , and it was the home of the poet until his death . [ Footnote 1 : Thomas Oliver was graduated from Harvard College in the class of<date>1758</date>. He was a gentleman of fortune , and lived first in Roxbury . He bought the property on Elmwood Avenue in<date>1766</date>. When he accepted the royal commission of Lieutenant-Governor , he became President of the Council appointed by the King . On Sept. 2 ,<date>1774</date>, about four thousand Middlesex freeholders assembled at<settlement>Cambridge</settlement>and compelled the mandamus councillors to resign . The President of the Council urged the propriety of delay , but the Committee would not spare him . He was forced to sign an agreement , “ as a man of honor and a Christian , that he would never hereafter , upon any terms whatsoever , accept a seat at said Board on the present novel and oppressive form of government . ” He immediately quitted<settlement>Cambridge</settlement>; and when the British troops evacuated<settlement>Boston</settlement>he accompanied them . By an odd coincidence he went to reside at Bristol ,<country>England</country>, where he died at the age of eighty-two years , in<date>1815</date>, shortly before the Lowells , who were of Bristol origin , took possession of his former home . In Underwood 's sketch of Lowell , Thomas Oliver is confused with Chief Justice Peter Oliver , a man of a very different type of character . ] Lowell 's early education was obtained mainly at a school kept nearly opposite Elmwood by a retired publisher , an Englishman , Mr. William Wells . He also studied in the classical school of Mr. Danial G. Ingraham in<settlement>Boston</settlement>. He was graduated from Harvard College in the class of<date>1838</date>. He is reported as declaring that he read almost everything except the class-books prescribed by the faculty . Lowell says , in one of his early poems referring to Harvard ,—</docImprint>
    <epigraph>
     <p>“ Tho ’ lightly prized the ribboned parchments three , Yet collegisse juvat , I am glad That here what colleging was mine I had . ”</p>
    </epigraph>
    <docImprint>He was secretary of the Hasty Pudding Society , and one of the editors of the college periodical Harvardiana , to which he contributed various articles in prose and verse . His neglect of prescribed studies , and disregard of college discipline , resulted in his rustication just before commencement in<date>1838</date>. He was sent to Concord , where he resided in the family of Barzillai Frost , and made the acquaintance of Emerson , then beginning to rouse the ire of conservative Unitarianism by his transcendental philosophy , of the brilliant but overestimated Margaret Fuller , who afterwards severely criticised Lowell 's verse , and of other well-known residents of the pretty town . He had been elected poet of his class . His removal from college prevented him from delivering the poem which was afterwards published anonymously for private distribution . It contained a satire on abolitionists and reformers . “ I know the village , ” he writes long afterwards in the person of Hosea Biglow , Esquire .</docImprint>
    <epigraph>
     <p>“ I know the village though , was sent there once A-schoolin ’ , ‘ cause to home I played the dunce ! ”</p>
    </epigraph>
    <docImprint>On his return to<settlement>Cambridge</settlement>he took up the study of law , and , in<date>1840</date>, received the degree of LL. B . He even went so far as to open an office in<settlement>Boston</settlement>; but it is a question whether there was any actual basis of fact in a whimsical sketch of his entitled “ My First Client , ” published in the short-lived<settlement>Boston</settlement>Miscellany , edited by Nathan Hale . Several things engrossed Lowell 's attention to the exclusion of law . Society at<settlement>Cambridge</settlement>was particularly attractive at that time . Allston the painter was living at Cambridgeport . Judge Story 's pleasant home was on Brattle Street . The Fays then occupied the house which has since become the seat of Radcliffe College . Longfellow , described as “ a slender , blond young professor , ” was established in the Craigie House . The famous names of Dr. Palfrey , Professor Andrews Norton , father of Lowell 's friend and biographer , the “ saintly ” Henry Ware , and others will occur to the reader . He was fond of walking and knew every inch of the beautiful ground then called “ Sweet Auburn , ” now turned by the hand of misguided man into that most distressing of monstrosities — a modern cemetery . He haunted the poetic shades of the Waverley Oaks , heard the charming music of Beaver Brook , and climbed the hills of Belmont and Arlington . He himself took his turn in establishing a magazine . In January ,<date>1843</date>, he started The Pioneer , to which Hawthorne , John Neal , Miss Barrett , Poe , Whittier , Story , Parsons , and others contributed , and which , in spite of such an array of talent , perished untimely during the winds of March . He had already published , in<date>1841</date>, a little volume of poems entitled “ A Year 's Life . ” They were marked by no great originality , betrayed little promise of future eminence , and Margaret Fuller , who reviewed them , was quite right in asserting that “ neither the imagery nor the music of Lowell 's verses was his own . ” The first sonnet in the present volume ( page 1 ) practically acknowledges the force of this criticism . The influence of Wordsworth and Tennyson may be distinctly traced in most of them . But many of the lines were harsh and many of the rhymes were careless . Lowell 's later and correcter taste omitted most of them from his collected works . Not far from Elmwood , but in the adjoining village of Watertown , lived one of Lowell 's classmates , whose sister , Maria White , a slender , delicate girl , with a poetic genius in some respects more regulated and lofty than his own , early inspired him with a true and saving love . Speaking of the influences that moulded his life , George William Curtis says :— “ The first and most enduring was an early and happy passion for a lovely and high-minded woman who became his wife — the Egeria who exalted his youth and confirmed his noblest aspirations ; a heaven-eyed counsellor of the serener air , who filled his mind with peace and his life with joy . ” The young lady 's prudent father objected to the marriage until the newly fledged lawyer should be in a position to support a wife . Shortly after the shipwreck of The Pioneer , Lowell was offered a hundred dollars by Graham 's Monthly for ten poems . When Pegasus is able to earn such princely sums , there seems no reason why Love should be kept waiting at the cottage door . In<date>1844</date>Lowell published a new edition of his poems , and married Miss White . It was her influence that decided him to cast in his lot with the abolitionists . It was her refined taste that shaped and tempered his impetuous verse . A volume of her poems was in<date>1855</date>, in an edition of fifty copies , privately printed , and is now very rare . It is an odd circumstance that in Lowell 's library , from which Harvard College was allowed to select any volumes not in Gore Hall , neither this book nor any of Lowell 's own early poems was to be found . The young couple took up their residence at Elmwood , and here were born three daughters and a son . All but one of his children died in infancy . Many of the tenderest of his poems refer with touching pathos to his bereavement : such for instance are “ The Changeling ” and “ The First Snowfall . ” In<date>1845</date>appeared “ The Vision of Sir Launfal , ” — a genuine inspiration composed in two days in a sort of ecstasy of poetic fervor . That more than anything established his fame . He recognized that he was dedicated to the Muses . In<date>1846</date>he wrote :— “ If I have any vocation , it is the making of verse . When I take my pen for that , the world opens itself ungrudgingly before me ; everything seems clear and easy , as it seems sinking to the bottom could be as one leans over the edge of his boat in one of those dear coves at Fresh Pond .... My true place is to serve the cause as a poet . Then my heart leaps before me into the conflict . ” The same year he began his “ Biglow Papers ” in the<settlement>Boston</settlement>Courier . Such jeux d'esprit are apt to be ephemeral . Lowell 's are immortal . They preserved in literary form a fast-fading dialect ; they caught and embalmed the mighty issues of a tremendous world-problem . Their influence was incalculable . He gathered them into a volume in<date>1848</date>, and became corresponding editor of the Anti-Slavery Standard . Fortunate man who throws himself into an unpopular cause which is in harmony with the Right ! How different from Wordsworth who attacked the ballot and took sides against reform ! Lowell 's penchant for satire was exemplified again the same year in his “ Fable for Critics . ” In this Lowell with no sparing hand laid on his portraits most droll and amusing colors . It is a comic portrait gallery , a series of caricatures whose greatest value ( as in all good caricatures ) lies in the accurate presentation of characteristic features . He did not spare himself :— “ There is Lowell , who 's striving Parnassus to climb With a whole bale of isms tied together with rhyme . He might get on alone , spite of troubles and bowlders , But he can n't with that bundle he has on his shoulders . The top of the hill he will ne'er come nigh reaching Till he learns the distinctions ‘ twixt singing and preaching ; His lyre has some chords that would ring pretty well , But he 'd rather by half make a drum of the shell , And rattle away till he 's old as Methusalem At the head of a march to the last New Jerusalem . ” Some of his thrusts left embittered feelings , but in general the tone was so good-natured that only the thin-skinned could object , and it must be confessed many of his judgments have been confirmed by Time . In<date>1851</date>Lowell visited Europe , and spent upwards of a year widening his acquaintance with the polite languages . But it is remarkable that Lowell gave the world almost no metrical translations . Shortly after his return his wife died ( Oct. 27 ,<date>1853</date>) after a slow decline . In reference to this bereavement Longfellow wrote his beautiful poem , “ The Two Angels . ” The following year Longfellow resigned the Smith Professorship of the French and Spanish Languages and Literature and Belles Lettres , and Lowell was appointed his successor with two years ’ leave of absence . He had won his spurs . He had collected his poems in two volumes , not including “ A Year 's Life , ” the “ Biglow Papers , ” or the “ Fable for Critics . ” He was known as one of the most brilliant contributors to Putnam 's Monthly and other magazines . In<date>1854</date>he delivered a series of twelve lectures on English poetry before the Lowell Institute . Ten years before he had published a volume of “ Conversations on the Poets . ” The contrast between the two works is no less pronounced than that between his earlier and later poems . In both , however , there is a tendency toward a confusing over-elaboration — Metaphors trample on the heels of Similes , and quaint and often grotesque conceits sometimes pall upon the taste , just as in the poems a flash of incongruous wit sometimes disturbs the serenity that is desirable . On his return from Europe , Mr. Lowell occupied the chair which he adorned by his brilliant attainments and made memorable by his fame . He lectured on Dante , Shakespeare , Chaucer , and Cervantes , and delighted his audiences . At the same time he was editor of the Atlantic Monthly for several years . From<date>1863</date>until<date>1872</date>he was associated with Professor Charles Eliot Norton in the conduct of the North American Review . In<date>1857</date>he married Miss Frances Dunlap of Portland , Me ., a cultivated lady who had been the governess of his daughter . She had unerring literary taste and sound judgment , and Mr. Lowell soon came to entrust to her the management of his financial affairs . She was enabled to make their comparatively small income more than meet the exigencies of an exacting position . The second series of the “ Biglow Papers , ” relating to the War of the Rebellion , were first published in the Atlantic . They were collected into a volume in<date>1865</date>. That year was rendered notable by his “ Commemoration Ode , ” the worthy crowning of one of the grandest poetic opportunities ever granted to man . “ Under the Willows ” appeared in<date>1869</date>; “ The Cathedral ” in<date>1870</date>. In<date>1864</date>he had issued a collection of his early descriptive articles under the title , “ Fireside Travels . ” In<date>1870</date>came “ Among my Books . ” The second series followed in<date>1876</date>. “ My Study Windows ” was published in<date>1871</date>. All these prose works were marked by an exuberant , vivid , poetic , impassioned style . The tropical efflorescence of imagery was characteristic of them all . He ought to have remembered his own words ,—</docImprint>
    <epigraph>
     <p>“ Over-ornament ruins both poem and prose . ”</p>
    </epigraph>
    <docImprint>In<date>1876</date>appeared three memorial poems : that read at Concord , April 19 ,<date>1875</date>; that read at<settlement>Cambridge</settlement>under the Washington Elm , July 3 ,<date>1875</date>; and the Fourth of July Ode of<date>1876</date>. This year Mr. Lowell was appointed one of the presidential electors ; and the following year President Hayes first offered him the Austrian mission , and , on his refusal of that , gave him the honorary post at<settlement>Madrid</settlement>, which had been adorned by Everett , Irving , and Prescott . He was there three years , and , on the retirement of Mr. Welsh in<date>1880</date>, was transferred to the Court of St. James , or , as one of the English papers expressed it , he became “ His Excellency the Ambassador of American Literature to the Court of Shakespeare . ” He was extremely popular . Known in private as “ one of the most marvellous of story-tellers , ” he became the lion of many public occasions . The<settlement>London</settlement>News spoke of the “ Extraordinary felicity of his occasional speeches . ” At Birmingham he delivered a noble address on Democracy . He was selected to deliver the oration at the dedication of the Dean Stanley Memorial . He spoke on Fielding at Taunton , on Coleridge at Westminster Abbey , on Gray at<settlement>Cambridge</settlement>. He was President of the Wordsworth Society . All sorts of honors were heaped upon him , both at home and abroad . He returned to<country>America</country>in<date>1885</date>, and once more occupied the somewhat dilapidated historic mansion at Elmwood . Once more he moved amid his rare and precious books , and heard the birds singing in the elms that his father had planted , or in the clustered bushes back of the house . He took a deep interest in the struggle for international copyright . He was President of the American Copyright League , and wrote the memorable lines :— “ In vain we call old notions fudge , And bend our conscience to our dealing ; The Ten Commandments will not budge ; And stealing will continue stealing . ” He used the leisure of his failing health in revising his works . His last volume of poems was entitled “ Heart 's Ease and Rue . ” One of his latest poems , “ My Book , ” appeared in the Christmas number of the<settlement>New York</settlement>Ledger in<date>1890</date>. In the December number of the Atlantic his hand was visible in the anonymous “ Contributor 's Club . ” During the last years his health was a matter of grave anxiety to his friends . In the spring of<date>1891</date>he seemed better . He was engaged in writing a life of Nathaniel Hawthorne . When the present writer call to see him one beautiful spring day , he found him in his library , at that moment engaged in making suggestions for the inscriptions on the new<settlement>Boston</settlement>Public Library . His manner was the perfection of courtesy and high breeding . His keen eyes seemed to read the very soul . Simplicity and beautiful dignity , tempered by evident feebleness of health , made him a memorable figure . Toward the end of the summer he suddenly grew more seriously ill . He suffered severely , and his last words were , “ Oh ! why do n't you let me die ? ” He drew his last breath in the early morning of Aug. 12 ,<date>1891</date>. He was buried at Mount Auburn , in the shadow of Indian Ridge , not far from Longfellow 's grave , in a lot unenclosed and marked by no monument . Memorial services were held in many places . Lord Tennyson cabled a message of sympathy : “<country>England</country>and<country>America</country>will mourn Mr. Lowell 's death . They loved him and he loved them . ” The Queen publicly expressed her respect and sorrow . Few men have left a deeper impress on their age . Few men have used noble powers more nobly . In private life and public station there is not a shadow to stain the whiteness of his fame . As a poet he stands in the front rank of those who have yet appeared in<country>America</country>. As a critic he was generous and just ; as a humorist he used his shafts of ridicule only to wound wrong ; as a statesman and diplomat he was actuated by broad , far-seeing views ; as a man he was a type to be upheld and followed .<country>America</country>has just cause to reverence his memory ; and the whole English-speaking world , without geographical distinction , claims him as its own .</docImprint>

      <head>A FRAGMENT .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The night is calm and beautiful ; the snow</l>
       <l n="2">Sparkles beneath the clear and frosty moon</l>
       <l n="3">And the cold stars , as if it took delight</l>
       <l n="4">In its own silent whiteness ; the hushed earth</l>
       <l n="5">Sleeps in the soft arms of the embracing blue ,</l>
       <l n="6">Secure as if angelic squadrons yet</l>
       <l n="7">Encamped about her , and each watching star</l>
       <l n="8">Gained double brightness from the flashing arms</l>
       <l n="9">Of winged and unsleeping sentinels .</l>
       <l n="10">Upward the calm of infinite silence deepens ,</l>
       <l n="11">The sea that flows between high heaven and earth ,</l>
       <l n="12">Musing by whose smooth brink we sometimes find</l>
       <l n="13">A stray leaf floated from those happier shores ,</l>
       <l n="14">And hope , perchance not vainly , that some flower</l>
       <l n="15">Which we had watered with our holiest tears ,</l>
       <l n="16">Pale blooms , and yet our scanty garden 's best ,</l>
       <l n="17">O'er the same ocean piloted by love ,</l>
       <l n="18">May find a haven at the feet of God ,</l>
       <l n="19">And be not wholly worthless in his sight .</l>
       <l n="20">O , high dependence on a higher Power ,</l>
       <l n="21">Sole stay for all these restless faculties</l>
       <l n="22">That wander , Ishmael-like , the desert bare</l>
       <l n="23">Wherein our human knowledge hath its home ,</l>
       <l n="24">Shifting their light-framed tents from day to day ,</l>
       <l n="25">With each new-found oasis , wearied soon ,</l>
       <l n="26">And only certain of uncertainty !</l>
       <l n="27">O , mighty humbleness that feels with awe ,</l>
       <l n="28">Yet with a vast exulting feels , no less ,</l>
       <l n="29">That this huge Minster of the Universe ,</l>
       <l n="30">Whose smallest oratories are glorious worlds ,</l>
       <l n="31">With painted oriels of dawn and sunset ;</l>
       <l n="32">Whose carved ornaments are systems grand ,</l>
       <l n="33">Orion kneeling in his starry niche ,</l>
       <l n="34">The Lyre whose strings give music audible</l>
       <l n="35">To holy ears , and countless splendors more ,</l>
       <l n="36">Crowned by the blazing Cross high-hung o'er all ;</l>
       <l n="37">Whose organ music is the solemn stops</l>
       <l n="38">Of endless Change breathed through by endless Good ;</l>
       <l n="39">Whose choristers are all the morning stars ;</l>
       <l n="40">Whose altar is the sacred human heart</l>
       <l n="41">Whereon Love 's candles burn unquenchably ,</l>
       <l n="42">Trimmed day and night by gentle-handed Peace ;</l>
       <l n="43">With all its arches and its pinnacles</l>
       <l n="44">That stretch forever and forever up ,</l>
       <l n="45">Is founded on the silent heart of God ,</l>
       <l n="46">Silent , yet pulsing forth exhaustless life</l>
       <l n="47">Through the least veins of all created things .</l>
       <l n="48">Fit musings these for the departing year ;</l>
       <l n="49">And God be thanked for such a crystal night</l>
       <l n="50">As fills the spirit with good store of thoughts ,</l>
       <l n="51">That , like a cheering fire of walnut , crackle</l>
       <l n="52">Upon the hearthstone of the heart , and cast</l>
       <l n="53">A mild home-glow o'er all Humanity !</l>
       <l n="54">Yes , though the poisoned shafts of evil doubts</l>
       <l n="55">Assail the skyey panoply of Faith ,</l>
       <l n="56">Though the great hopes which we have had for man ,</l>
       <l n="57">Foes in disguise , because they based belief</l>
       <l n="58">On man 's endeavor , not on God 's decree —</l>
       <l n="59">Though these proud-visaged hopes , once turned to fly ,</l>
       <l n="60">Hurl backward many a deadly Parthian dart</l>
       <l n="61">That rankles in the soul and makes it sick</l>
       <l n="62">With vain regret , nigh verging on despair —</l>
       <l n="63">Yet , in such calm and earnest hours as this ,</l>
       <l n="64">We well can feel how every living heart</l>
       <l n="65">That sleeps to-night in palace or in cot ,</l>
       <l n="66">Or unroofed hovel , or which need hath known</l>
       <l n="67">Of other homestead than the arching sky ,</l>
       <l n="68">Is circled watchfully with seraph fires ;</l>
       <l n="69">How our own erring will it is that hangs</l>
       <l n="70">The flaming sword o'er Eden 's unclosed gate ,</l>
       <l n="71">Which gives free entrance to the pure in heart ,</l>
       <l n="72">And with its guarding walls doth fence the meek .</l>
       <l n="73">Sleep then , O Earth , in thy blue-vaulted cradle ,</l>
       <l n="74">Bent over always by thy mother Heaven !</l>
       <l n="75">We all are tall enough to reach God 's hand ,</l>
       <l n="76">And angels are no taller : looking back</l>
       <l n="77">Upon the smooth wake of a year o'erpast ,</l>
       <l n="78">We see the black clouds furling , one by one ,</l>
       <l n="79">From the advancing majesty of Truth ,</l>
       <l n="80">And something won for Freedom , whose least gain</l>
       <l n="81">Is as a firm and rock-built citadel</l>
       <l n="82">Wherefrom to launch fresh battle on her foes ;</l>
       <l n="83">Or , leaning from the time 's extremest prow ,</l>
       <l n="84">If we gaze forward through the blinding spray ,</l>
       <l n="85">And dimly see how much of ill remains ,</l>
       <l n="86">How many fetters to be sawn asunder</l>
       <l n="87">By the slow toil of individual zeal ,</l>
       <l n="88">Or haply rusted by salt tears in twain ,</l>
       <l n="89">We feel , with something of a sadder heart ,</l>
       <l n="90">Yet bracing up our bruised mail the while ,</l>
       <l n="91">And fronting the old foe with fresher spirit ,</l>
       <l n="92">How great it is to breathe with human breath ,</l>
       <l n="93">To be but poor foot-soldiers in the ranks</l>
       <l n="94">Of our old exiled king , Humanity ;</l>

       <l n="115">Fitted already on their golden string ,</l>
       <l n="116">Shall soon leap earthward with exulting flight</l>
       <l n="117">To thrid the dark heart of that evil faith</l>
       <l n="118">Whose trust is in the clumsy arms of Force ,</l>
       <l n="119">The ozier hauberk of a ruder age ?</l>
       <l n="120">Freedom ! thou other name for happy Truth ,</l>

       <l n="123">Nor thy fierce eye enticed from its watch ,</l>
       <l n="124">Thou hast learned now , by hero-blood in vain</l>
       <l n="125">Poured to enrich the soil which tyrants reap ;</l>
       <l n="126">By wasted lives of prophets , and of those</l>
       <l n="127">Who , by the promise in their souls upheld ,</l>
       <l n="128">Into the red arms of a fiery death</l>
       <l n="129">Went blithely as the golden-girdled bee</l>

       <l n="131">By the long woes of nations set at war ,</l>
       <l n="132">That so the swollen torrent of their wrath</l>
       <l n="133">May find a vent , else sweeping off like straws</l>
       <l n="134">The thousand cobweb threads , grown cable-huge</l>
       <l n="135">By time 's long gathered dust , but cobwebs still ,</l>
       <l n="136">Which bind the Many that the Few may gain</l>
       <l n="137">Leisure to wither by the drought of ease</l>
       <l n="138">What heavenly germs in their own souls were sown ;—</l>
       <l n="139">By all these searching lessons thou hast learned</l>
       <l n="140">To throw aside thy blood-stained helm and spear</l>
       <l n="141">And with thy bare brow daunt the enemy 's front ,</l>
       <l n="142">Knowing that God will make the lily stalk ,</l>

       <l n="1">True Love is but a humble , low-born thing ,</l>
       <l n="2">And hath its food served up in earthen ware ;</l>
       <l n="3">It is a thing to walk with , hand in hand ,</l>
       <l n="4">Through the everydayness of this work-day world ,</l>
       <l n="5">Baring its tender feet to every roughness ,</l>
       <l n="6">Yet letting not one heart-beat go astray</l>
       <l n="7">From Beauty 's law of plainness and content .</l>
       <l n="8">A simple , fireside thing , whose quiet smile</l>
       <l n="9">Can warm earth 's poorest hovel to a home ;</l>
       <l n="10">Which , when our autumn cometh , as it must ,</l>
       <l n="11">And life in the chill wind shivers bare and leafless ,</l>
       <l n="12">Shall still be blest with Indian-summer youth</l>
       <l n="13">In bleak November , and , with thankful heart ,</l>
       <l n="14">Smile on its ample stores of garnered fruit ,</l>
       <l n="15">As full of sunshine to our aged eyes</l>
       <l n="16">As when it nursed the blossoms of our spring .</l>
       <l n="17">Such is true Love , which steals into the heart</l>
       <l n="18">With feet as silent as the lightsome dawn</l>
       <l n="19">That kisses smooth the rough brows of the dark ,</l>
       <l n="20">And hath its will through blissful gentleness ,—</l>
       <l n="21">Not like a rocket , which , with savage glare ,</l>
       <l n="22">Whirrs suddenly up , then bursts , and leaves the night</l>
       <l n="23">Painfully quivering on the dazed eyes ;</l>
       <l n="24">A love that gives and takes , that seeth faults ,</l>
       <l n="25">Not with flaw-seeking eyes like needle points ,</l>
       <l n="26">But loving-kindly ever looks them down</l>
       <l n="27">With the o'ercoming faith of meek forgiveness ;</l>
       <l n="28">A love that shall be new and fresh each hour ,</l>
       <l n="29">As is the golden mystery of sunset ,</l>
       <l n="30">Or the sweet coming of the evening star ,</l>
       <l n="31">Alike , and yet most unlike , every day ,</l>
       <l n="32">And seeming ever best and fairest now ;</l>
       <l n="33">A love that doth not kneel for what it seeks ,</l>
       <l n="34">But faces Truth and Beauty as their peer ,</l>
       <l n="35">Showing its worthiness of noble thoughts</l>
       <l n="36">By a clear sense of inward nobleness ;</l>
       <l n="37">A love that in its object findeth not</l>
       <l n="38">All grace and beauty , and enough to sate</l>
       <l n="39">Its thirst of blessing , but , in all of good</l>
       <l n="40">Found there , it sees but Heaven-granted types</l>
       <l n="41">Of good and beauty in the soul of man ,</l>
       <l n="42">And traces , in the simplest heart that beats ,</l>
       <l n="43">A family-likeness to its chosen one ,</l>
       <l n="44">That claims of it the rights of brotherhood .</l>
       <l n="45">For love is blind but with the fleshly eye ,</l>
       <l n="46">That so its inner sight may be more clear ;</l>
       <l n="47">And outward shows of beauty only so</l>
       <l n="48">Are needful at the first , as is a hand</l>
       <l n="49">To guide and to uphold an infant 's steps :</l>
       <l n="50">Great spirits need them not : their earnest look</l>
       <l n="51">Pierces the body 's mask of thin disguise ,</l>
       <l n="52">And beauty ever is to them revealed ,</l>
       <l n="53">Behind the unshapeliest , meanest lump of clay ,</l>
       <l n="54">With arms outstretched and eager face ablaze ,</l>

        <l n="47">And , with strong arm and purpose firm and steady ,</l>
        <l n="48">An anchor for the drifting world he wrought .</l>

       <l n="34">As the immortal freshness of that grace</l>
       <l n="35">Carved for all ages on some Attic frieze .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="36">A youth named Rhoecus , wandering in the wood ,</l>
       <l n="37">Saw an old oak just trembling to its fall ,</l>
       <l n="38">And , feeling pity of so fair a tree ,</l>
       <l n="39">He propped its gray trunk with admiring care ,</l>
       <l n="40">And with a thoughtless footstep loitered on .</l>
       <l n="41">But , as he turned , he heard a voice behind</l>
       <l n="42">That murmured “ Rhoecus ! ” ‘ Twas as if the leaves ,</l>
       <l n="43">Stirred by a passing breath , had murmured it ,</l>
       <l n="44">And , while he paused bewildered , yet again</l>
       <l n="45">It murmured “ Rhoecus ! ” softer than a breeze .</l>
       <l n="46">He started and beheld with dizzy eyes</l>
       <l n="47">What seemed the substance of a happy dream</l>
       <l n="48">Stand there before him , spreading a warm glow</l>
       <l n="49">Within the green glooms of the shadowy oak .</l>
       <l n="50">It seemed a woman 's shape , yet all too fair</l>
       <l n="51">To be a woman , and with eyes too meek</l>
       <l n="52">For any that were wont to mate with gods .</l>
       <l n="53">All naked like a goddess stood she there ,</l>
       <l n="54">And like a goddess all too beautiful</l>
       <l n="55">To feel the guilt-born earthliness of shame .</l>
       <l n="56">“ Rhoecus , I am the Dryad of this tree , ”</l>
       <l n="57">Thus she began , dropping her low-toned words</l>
       <l n="58">Serene , and full , and clear , as drops of dew ,</l>
       <l n="59">“ And with it I am doomed to live and die ;</l>
       <l n="60">The rain and sunshine are my caterers ,</l>
       <l n="61">Nor have I other bliss than simple life ;</l>
       <l n="62">Now ask me what thou wilt , that I can give ,</l>
       <l n="63">And with a thankful joy it shall be thine . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="64">Then Rhoecus , with a flutter at the heart ,</l>
       <l n="65">Yet , by the prompting of such beauty , bold ,</l>
       <l n="66">Answered : “ What is there that can satisfy</l>
       <l n="67">The endless craving of the soul but love ?</l>
       <l n="68">Give me thy love , or but the hope of that</l>
       <l n="69">Which must be evermore my spirit 's goal . ”</l>
       <l n="70">After a little pause she said again ,</l>
       <l n="71">But with a glimpse of sadness in her tone ,</l>
       <l n="72">“ I give it , Rhoecus , though a perilous gift ;</l>
       <l n="73">An hour before the sunset meet me here . ”</l>
       <l n="74">And straightway there was nothing he could see</l>
       <l n="75">But the green glooms beneath the shadowy oak ,</l>
       <l n="76">And not a sound came to his straining ears</l>
       <l n="77">But the low trickling rustle of the leaves ,</l>
       <l n="78">And far away upon an emerald slope</l>
       <l n="79">The falter of an idle shepherd 's pipe .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="80">Now , in those days of simpleness and faith ,</l>
       <l n="81">Men did not think that happy things were dreams</l>
       <l n="82">Because they overstepped the narrow bourne</l>
       <l n="83">Of likelihood , but reverently deemed</l>
       <l n="84">Nothing too wondrous or too beautiful</l>
       <l n="85">To be the guerdon of a daring heart .</l>
       <l n="86">So Rhoecus made no doubt that he was blest ,</l>
       <l n="87">And all along unto the city 's gate</l>
       <l n="88">Earth seemed to spring beneath him as he walked ,</l>
       <l n="89">The clear , broad sky looked bluer than its wont ,</l>
       <l n="90">And he could scarce believe he had not wings</l>
       <l n="91">Such sunshine seemed to glitter through his veins</l>
       <l n="92">Instead of blood , so light he felt and strange .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="93">Young Rhoecus had a faithful heart enough ,</l>
       <l n="94">But one that in the present dwelt too much ,</l>
       <l n="95">And , taking with blithe welcome whatsoe'er</l>
       <l n="96">Chance gave of joy , was wholly bound in that ,</l>
       <l n="97">Like the contented peasant of a vale ,</l>
       <l n="98">Deemed it the world , and never looked beyond .</l>
       <l n="99">So , haply meeting in the afternoon</l>
       <l n="100">Some comrades who were playing at the dice</l>
       <l n="101">He joined them and forgot all else beside .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="102">The dice were rattling at the merriest ,</l>
       <l n="103">And Rhoecus , who had met but sorry luck ,</l>
       <l n="104">Just laughed in triumph at a happy throw ,</l>
       <l n="105">When through the room there hummed a yellow bee</l>
       <l n="106">That buzzed about his ear with down-dropped legs</l>
       <l n="107">As if to light . And Rhoecus laughed and said ,</l>
       <l n="108">Feeling how red and flushed he was with loss ,</l>
       <l n="109">“ By Venus ! does he take me for a rose ? ”</l>
       <l n="110">And brushed him off with rough , impatient hand .</l>
       <l n="111">But still the bee came back , and thrice again</l>
       <l n="112">Rhoecus did beat him off with growing wrath .</l>
       <l n="113">Then through the window flew the wounded bee ,</l>
       <l n="114">And Rhoecus , tracking him with angry eyes ,</l>
       <l n="115">Saw a sharp mountain-peak of Thessaly</l>
       <l n="116">Against the red disc of the setting sun ,—</l>
       <l n="117">And instantly the blood sank from his heart ,</l>
       <l n="118">As if its very walls had caved away .</l>
       <l n="119">Without a word he turned , and , rushing forth ,</l>
       <l n="120">Ran madly through the city and the gate ,</l>
       <l n="121">And o'er the plain , which now the wood 's long shade ,</l>
       <l n="122">By the low sun thrown forward broad and dim ,</l>
       <l n="123">Darkened wellnigh unto the city 's wall .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="124">Quite spent and out of breath he reached the tree ,</l>
       <l n="125">And , listening fearfully , he heard once more</l>
       <l n="126">The low voice murmur “ Rhoecus ! ” close at hand :</l>
       <l n="127">Whereat he looked around him , but could see</l>
       <l n="128">Naught but the deepening glooms beneath the oak .</l>
       <l n="129">Then sighed the voice , “ Oh , Rhoecus ! nevermore</l>
       <l n="130">Shalt thou behold me or by day or night ,</l>
       <l n="131">Me , who would fain have blessed thee with a love</l>
       <l n="132">More ripe and bounteous than ever yet</l>
       <l n="133">Filled up with nectar any mortal heart :</l>
       <l n="134">But thou didst scorn my humble messenger ,</l>
       <l n="135">And sent'st him back to me with bruised wings .</l>
       <l n="136">We spirits only show to gentle eyes .</l>
       <l n="137">We ever ask an undivided love ,</l>
       <l n="138">And he who scorns the least of Nature 's works</l>
       <l n="139">Is thenceforth exiled and shut out from all .</l>
       <l n="140">Farewell ! for thou canst never see me more . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="141">Then Rhoecus beat his breast , and groaned aloud</l>
       <l n="142">And cried , “ Be pitiful ! forgive me yet</l>
       <l n="143">This once , and I shall never need it more ! ”</l>
       <l n="144">“ Alas ! ” the voice returned , “ ‘ t is thou art blind ,</l>
       <l n="145">Not I unmerciful ; I can forgive ,</l>
       <l n="146">But have no skill to heal thy spirit 's eyes ;</l>
       <l n="147">Only the soul hath power o'er itself . ”</l>
       <l n="148">With that again there murmured “ Nevermore ! ”</l>
       <l n="149">And Rhoecus after heard no other sound ,</l>
       <l n="150">Except the rattling of the oak 's crisp leaves ,</l>
       <l n="151">Like the long surf upon a distant shore ,</l>
       <l n="152">Raking the sea-worn pebbles up and down .</l>
       <l n="153">The night had gathered round him : o'er the plain</l>
       <l n="154">The city sparkled with its thousand lights ,</l>
       <l n="155">And sounds of revel fell upon his ear</l>
       <l n="156">Harshly and like a curse ; above , the sky ,</l>
       <l n="157">With all its bright sublimity of stars ,</l>
       <l n="158">Deepened , and on his forehead smote the breeze ;</l>
       <l n="159">Beauty was all around him and delight ,</l>
       <l n="160">But from that eve he was alone on earth .</l>

       <l n="192">Not their most learned clerks can understand .</l>
       <l n="193">New times demand new measures and new men ;</l>
       <l n="194">The world advances , and in time outgrows</l>
       <l n="195">The laws that in our fathers ’ day were best ;</l>
       <l n="196">And , doubtless , after us , some purer scheme</l>
       <l n="197">Will be shaped out by wiser men than we ,</l>
       <l n="198">Made wiser by the steady growth of truth .</l>
       <l n="199">We cannot bring Utopia by force ;</l>
       <l n="200">But better , almost , be at work in sin ;</l>
       <l n="201">Than in a brute inaction browse and sleep .</l>
       <l n="202">No man is born into the world , whose work</l>
       <l n="203">Is not born with him ; there is always work ,</l>
       <l n="204">And tools to work withal , for those who will ;</l>
       <l n="205">And blessed are the horny hands of toil !</l>
       <l n="206">The busy world shoves angrily aside</l>
       <l n="207">The man who stands with arms akimbo set ,</l>
       <l n="208">Until occasion tells him what to do ;</l>
       <l n="209">And he who waits to have his task marked out</l>
       <l n="210">Shall die and leave his errand unfulfilled .</l>
       <l n="211">Our time is one that calls for earnest deeds :</l>
       <l n="212">Reason and Government , like two broad seas ,</l>
       <l n="213">Yearn for each other with outstretched arms</l>
       <l n="214">Across this narrow isthmus of the throne ,</l>
       <l n="215">And roll their white surf higher every day .</l>
       <l n="216">One age moves onward , and the next builds up</l>
       <l n="217">Cities and gorgeous palaces , where stood</l>
       <l n="218">The rude log huts of those who tamed the wild ,</l>
       <l n="219">Rearing from out the forests they had felled</l>
       <l n="220">The goodly framework of a fairer state ;</l>
       <l n="221">The builder 's trowel and the settler 's axe</l>
       <l n="222">Are seldom wielded by the selfsame hand ;</l>
       <l n="223">Ours is the harder task , yet not the less</l>
       <l n="224">Shall we receive the blessing for our toil</l>
       <l n="225">From the choice spirits of the aftertime .</l>
       <l n="226">My soul is not a palace of the past ,</l>
       <l n="227">Where outworn creeds , like Rome 's gray senate quake ,</l>
       <l n="228">Hearing afar the Vandal 's trumpet hoarse ,</l>
       <l n="229">That shakes old systems with a thunder-fit .</l>
       <l n="230">The time is ripe , and rotten-ripe , for change ;</l>
       <l n="231">Then let it come : I have no dread of what</l>
       <l n="232">Is called for by the instinct of mankind ;</l>
       <l n="233">Nor think I that God 's world will fall apart ,</l>
       <l n="234">Because we tear a parchment more or less .</l>
       <l n="235">Truth is eternal , but her effluence ,</l>
       <l n="236">With endless change is fitted to the hour ;</l>
       <l n="237">Her mirror is turned forward to reflect</l>
       <l n="238">The promise of the future , not the past .</l>
       <l n="239">He who would win the name of truly great</l>
       <l n="240">Must understand his own age and the next ,</l>
       <l n="241">And make the present ready to fulfil</l>
       <l n="242">Its prophecy , and with the future merge</l>
       <l n="243">Gently and peacefully , as wave with wave .</l>
       <l n="244">The future works out great men 's destinies ;</l>
       <l n="245">The present is enough for common souls ,</l>
       <l n="246">Who , never looking forward , are indeed</l>
       <l n="247">Mere clay , wherein the footprints of their age</l>
       <l n="248">Are petrified forever : better those</l>
       <l n="249">Who lead the blind old giant by the hand</l>
       <l n="250">From out the pathless desert where he gropes ,</l>
       <l n="251">And set him onward in his darksome way .</l>
       <l n="252">I do not fear to follow out the truth ,</l>
       <l n="253">Albeit along the precipice 's edge .</l>
       <l n="254">Let us speak plain : there is more force in names</l>
       <l n="255">Than most men dream of ; and a lie may keep</l>
       <l n="256">Its throne a whole age longer , if it skulk</l>
       <l n="257">Behind the shield of some fair-seeming name ,</l>
       <l n="258">Let us call tyrants , tyrants , and maintain ,</l>
       <l n="259">That only freedom comes by grace of God ,</l>
       <l n="260">And all that comes not by his grace must fall</l>
       <l n="261">For men in earnest have no time to waste</l>

       <l n="1">The old Chief , feeling now well-nigh his end ,</l>
       <l n="2">Called his two eldest children to his side ,</l>
       <l n="3">And gave them , in few words , his parting charge :—</l>
       <l n="4">“ My son and daughter , me ye see no more ;</l>
       <l n="5">The happy hunting-grounds await me , green</l>
       <l n="6">With change of spring and summer through the year :</l>
       <l n="7">But , for remembrance , after I am gone ,</l>
       <l n="8">Be kind to little Sheemah for my sake :</l>
       <l n="9">Weakling he is and young , and knows not yet</l>
       <l n="10">To set the trap , or draw the seasoned bow ;</l>
       <l n="11">Therefore of both your loves he hath more need ,</l>
       <l n="12">And he , who needeth love , to love hath right ;</l>
       <l n="13">It is not like our furs and stores of corn ,</l>
       <l n="14">Whereto we claim sole title by our toil ,</l>
       <l n="15">But the Great Spirit plants it in our hearts ,</l>
       <l n="16">And waters it , and gives it sun , to be</l>
       <l n="17">The common stock and heritage of all :</l>
       <l n="18">Therefore be kind to Sheemah , that yourselves</l>
       <l n="19">May not be left deserted in your need . ”</l>

       <l n="20">Alone , beside a lake , their wigwam stood ,</l>
       <l n="21">Far from the other dwellings of their tribe ;</l>
       <l n="22">And , after many moons , the loneliness</l>
       <l n="23">Wearied the elder brother , and he said ,</l>
       <l n="24">“ Why should I dwell here all alone , shut out</l>
       <l n="25">From the free , natural joys that fit my age ?</l>
       <l n="26">Lo , I am tall and strong , well skilled to hunt ,</l>
       <l n="27">Patient of toil and hunger , and not yet</l>
       <l n="28">Have seen the danger which I dared not look</l>
       <l n="29">Full in the face ; what hinders me to be</l>
       <l n="30">A mighty Brave and Chief among my kin ? ”</l>
       <l n="31">So , taking up his arrows and his bow ,</l>
       <l n="32">As if to hunt , he journeyed swiftly on ,</l>
       <l n="33">Until he gained the wigwams of his tribe ,</l>
       <l n="34">Where , choosing out a bride , he soon forgot ,</l>
       <l n="35">In all the fret and bustle of new life ,</l>
       <l n="36">The little Sheemah and his father 's charge .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="37">Now when the sister found her brother gone ,</l>
       <l n="38">And that , for many days , he came not back ,</l>
       <l n="39">She wept for Sheemah more than for herself ;</l>
       <l n="40">For Love bides longest in a woman 's heart ,</l>
       <l n="41">And flutters many times before he flies ,</l>
       <l n="42">And then doth perch so nearly , that a word</l>
       <l n="43">May lure him back , as swift and glad as light ;</l>
       <l n="44">And Duty lingers even when Love is gone</l>
       <l n="45">Oft looking out in hope of his return ;</l>
       <l n="46">And , after Duty hath been driven forth ,</l>
       <l n="47">Then Selfishness creeps in the last of all ,</l>
       <l n="48">Warming her lean hands at the lonely hearth ,</l>
       <l n="49">And crouching o'er the embers , to shut out</l>
       <l n="50">Whatever paltry warmth and light are left ,</l>
       <l n="51">With avaricious greed , from all beside .</l>
       <l n="52">So , for long months , the sister hunted wide ,</l>
       <l n="53">And cared for little Sheemah tenderly ;</l>
       <l n="54">But , daily more and more , the loneliness</l>
       <l n="55">Grew wearisome , and to herself she sighed ,</l>
       <l n="56">“ Am I not fair ? at least the glassy pool ,</l>
       <l n="57">That hath no cause to flatter , tells me so ;</l>
       <l n="58">But , O , how flat and meaningless the tale ,</l>
       <l n="59">Unless it tremble on a lover 's tongue !</l>
       <l n="60">Beauty hath no true glass , except it be</l>
       <l n="61">In the sweet privacy of loving eyes . ”</l>
       <l n="62">Thus deemed she idly , and forgot the lore</l>
       <l n="63">Which she had learned of nature and the woods ,</l>
       <l n="64">That beauty 's chief reward is to itself ,</l>
       <l n="65">And that the eyes of Love reflect alone</l>
       <l n="66">The inward fairness , which is blurred and lost</l>
       <l n="67">Unless kept clear and white by Duty 's care</l>
       <l n="68">So she went forth and sought the haunts of men ,</l>
       <l n="69">And , being wedded , in her household cares ,</l>
       <l n="70">Soon , like the elder brother , quite forgot</l>
       <l n="71">The little Sheemah and her father 's charge .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="72">But Sheemah , left alone within the lodge ,</l>
       <l n="73">Waited and waited , with a shrinking heart ,</l>
       <l n="74">Thinking each rustle was his sister 's step ,</l>
       <l n="75">Till hope grew less and less , and then went out ,</l>
       <l n="76">And every sound was changed from hope to fear .</l>
       <l n="77">Few sounds there were :— the dropping of a nut ,</l>
       <l n="78">The squirrel 's chirrup , and the jay 's harsh scream ,</l>
       <l n="79">Autumn 's sad remnants of blithe Summer 's cheer ,</l>
       <l n="80">Heard at long intervals , seemed but to make</l>
       <l n="81">The dreadful void of silence silenter .</l>
       <l n="82">Soon what small store his sister left was gone ,</l>
       <l n="83">And , through the Autumn , he made shift to live</l>
       <l n="84">On roots and berries , gathered in much fear</l>
       <l n="85">Of wolves , whose ghastly howl he heard ofttimes ,</l>
       <l n="86">Hollow and hungry , at the dead of night .</l>
       <l n="87">But Winter came at last , and , when the snow ,</l>
       <l n="88">Thick-heaped for gleaming leagues o'er hill and plain ,</l>
       <l n="89">Spread its unbroken silence over all ,</l>
       <l n="90">Made bold by hunger , he was fain to glean ,</l>
       <l n="91">( More sick at heart than Ruth , and all alone ,)</l>
       <l n="92">After the harvest of the merciless wolf ,</l>
       <l n="93">Grim Boaz , who , sharp-ribbed and gaunt , yet feared</l>
       <l n="94">A thing more wild and starving than himself ;</l>
       <l n="95">Till , by degrees , the wolf and he grew friends ,</l>
       <l n="96">And shared , together all the winter through .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="97">Late in the Spring , when all the ice was gone ,</l>
       <l n="98">The elder brother , fishing in the lake ,</l>
       <l n="99">Upon whose edge his father 's wigwam stood ,</l>
       <l n="100">Heard a low moaning noise upon the shore :</l>
       <l n="101">Half like a child it seemed , half like a wolf ,</l>
       <l n="102">And straightway there was something in his heart</l>
       <l n="103">That said , “ It is thy brother Sheemah 's voice . ”</l>
       <l n="104">So , paddling swiftly to the bank , he saw ,</l>
       <l n="105">Within a little thicket close at hand ,</l>
       <l n="106">A child that seemed fast changing to a wolf ,</l>
       <l n="107">From the neck downward , gray with shaggy hair</l>
       <l n="108">That still crept on and upward as he looked .</l>
       <l n="109">The face was turned away , but well he knew</l>
       <l n="110">That it was Sheemah 's , even his brother 's face .</l>
       <l n="111">Then with his trembling hands he hid his eyes ,</l>
       <l n="112">And bowed his head , so that he might not see</l>
       <l n="113">The first look of his brother 's eyes , and cried ,</l>
       <l n="114">“ O , Sheemah ! O , my brother , speak to me !</l>
       <l n="115">Dost thou not know me , that I am thy brother ?</l>
       <l n="116">Come to me , little Sheemah , thou shalt dwell</l>
       <l n="117">With me henceforth , and know no care or want ! ”</l>
       <l n="118">Sheemah was silent for a space , as if</l>
       <l n="119">‘ T were hard to summon up a human voice ,</l>
       <l n="120">And , when he spake , the sound was of a wolf 's :</l>
       <l n="121">“ I know thee not , nor art thou what thou say'st ;</l>
       <l n="122">I have none other brethren than the wolves ,</l>
       <l n="123">And , till thy heart be changed from what it is ,</l>
       <l n="124">Thou art not worthy to be called their kin . ”</l>
       <l n="125">Then groaned the other , with a choking tongue ,</l>
       <l n="126">“ Alas ! my heart is changed right bitterly ;</l>
       <l n="127">‘ Tis shrunk and parched within me even now ! ”</l>
       <l n="128">And , looking upward fearfully , he saw</l>
       <l n="129">Only a wolf that shrank away and ran ,</l>
       <l n="130">Ugly and fierce , to hide among the woods .</l>

       <l n="220">For the cheap means putting Heaven 's ends in pawn ,</l>

       <l n="222">Of destiny 's first-born , for smoother fields</l>

       <l n="230">Is steeper to the angel than the child .</l>
       <l n="231">Chances have laws as fixed as planets have ,</l>

       <l n="244">The inspired soul but flings his patience in ,</l>

      <head>AN INCIDENT OF THE FIRE AT HAMBURG .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The tower of old Saint Nicholas soared upward to the skies ,</l>
       <l n="2">Like some huge piece of Nature 's make , the growth of centuries ;</l>
       <l n="3">You could not deem its crowding spires a work of human art ,</l>
       <l n="4">They seemed to struggle lightward from a sturdy living heart .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">Not Nature 's self more freely speaks in crystal or in oak ,</l>
       <l n="6">Than , through the pious builder 's hand , in that gray pile she spoke ;</l>
       <l n="7">And as from acorn springs the oak , so , freely and alone ,</l>
       <l n="8">Sprang from his heart this hymn to God , sung in obedient stone .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">It seemed a wondrous freak of chance , so perfect , yet so rough ,</l>
       <l n="10">A whim of Nature crystallized slowly in granite tough ;</l>
       <l n="11">The thick spires yearned towards the sky in quaint , harmonious lines ,</l>
       <l n="12">And in broad sunlight basked and slept , like a grove of blasted pines .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">Never did rock or stream or tree lay claim with better right</l>
       <l n="14">To all the adorning sympathies of shadow and of light ;</l>
       <l n="15">And , in that forest petrified , as forester there dwells</l>
       <l n="16">Stout Herman , the old sacristan , sole lord of all its bells .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">Surge leaping after surge , the fire roared onward red as blood ,</l>
       <l n="18">Till half of Hamburg lay engulfed beneath the eddying flood ;</l>
       <l n="19">For miles away , the fiery spray poured down its deadly rain ,</l>
       <l n="20">And back and forth the billows sucked , and paused , and burst again .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="21">From square to square with tiger leaps panted the lustful fire ,</l>
       <l n="22">The air to leeward shuddered with the gasps of its desire ;</l>
       <l n="23">And church and palace , which even now stood whelmed but to the knee ,</l>
       <l n="24">Lift their black roofs like breakers lone amid the whirling sea .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="25">Up in his tower old Herman sat and watched with quiet look ;</l>
       <l n="26">His soul had trusted God too long to be at last forsook ;</l>
       <l n="27">He could not fear , for surely God a pathway would unfold</l>
       <l n="28">Through this red sea for faithful hearts , as once he did of old .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="29">But scarcely can he cross himself , or on his good saint call ,</l>
       <l n="30">Before the sacrilegious flood o'erleaped the churchyard wall ;</l>
       <l n="31">And , ere a pater half was said , mid smoke and crackling glare ,</l>
       <l n="32">His island tower scarce juts its head above the wide despair .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="33">Upon the peril 's desperate peak his heart stood up sublime ;</l>
       <l n="34">His first thought was for God above , his next was for his chime ;</l>
       <l n="35">“ Sing now and make your voices heard in hymns of praise , ” cried he ,</l>
       <l n="36">“ As did the Israelites of old , safe walking through the sea !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="37">“ Through this red sea our God hath made the pathway safe to shore ;</l>
       <l n="38">Our promised land stands full in sight ; shout now as ne'er before ! ”</l>
       <l n="39">And as the tower came crushing down , the bells , in clear accord ,</l>
       <l n="40">Pealed forth the grand old German hymn ,— “ All good souls , praise the</l>
       <l n="41">Lord ! ”</l>

      <head>THE GROWTH OF THE LEGEND .</head>
      <head>A FRAGMENT .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">A legend that grew in the forest 's hush</l>
       <l n="2">Slowly as tear-drops gather and gush ,</l>
       <l n="3">When a word some poet chanced to say</l>
       <l n="4">Ages ago , in his careless way ,</l>
       <l n="5">Brings our youth back to us out of its shroud</l>
       <l n="6">Clearly as under yon thunder-cloud</l>
       <l n="7">I see that white sea-gull . It grew and grew ,</l>
       <l n="8">From the pine-trees gathering a sombre hue ,</l>
       <l n="9">Till it seems a mere murmur out of the vast</l>
       <l n="10">Norwegian forests of the past ;</l>
       <l n="11">And it grew itself like a true Northern pine ,</l>
       <l n="12">First a little slender line ,</l>
       <l n="13">Like a mermaid 's green eyelash , and then anon</l>
       <l n="14">A stem that a tower might rest upon ,</l>
       <l n="15">Standing spear-straight in the waist-deep moss ,</l>
       <l n="16">Its bony roots clutching around and across ,</l>
       <l n="17">As if they would tear up earth 's heart in their grasp</l>
       <l n="18">Ere the storm should uproot them or make them unclasp ;</l>
       <l n="19">Its cloudy boughs singing , as suiteth the pine ,</l>
       <l n="20">To shrunk snow-bearded sea-kings old songs of the brine ,</l>
       <l n="21">Till they straightened and let their staves fall to the floor ,</l>
       <l n="22">Hearing waves moan again on the perilous shore</l>
       <l n="23">Of Vinland , perhaps , while their prow groped its way</l>

       <l n="29">‘ Twas a natural growth , and stood fearlessly there ,</l>
       <l n="30">A true part of the landscape as sea , land , and air ;</l>

       <l n="40">And there , with archers circled , close at hand ,</l>
       <l n="41">A camel with the chest was seen to stand ,</l>

       <l n="54">Our country hath a gospel of her own</l>
       <l n="55">To preach and practise before all the world ,—</l>
       <l n="56">The freedom and divinity of man ,</l>
       <l n="57">The glorious claims of human brotherhood ,—</l>

       <l n="63">Seem small , and worthless , and contemptible .</l>
       <l n="64">These are the mountain-summits for our bards ,</l>

       <l n="69">Our new Atlantis , like a morning-star ,</l>
       <l n="70">Silvers the murk face of slow-yielding Night ,</l>
       <l n="71">The herald of a fuller truth than yet</l>
       <l n="72">Hath gleamed upon the upraised face of Man</l>
       <l n="73">Since the earth glittered in her stainless prime ,—</l>
       <l n="74">Of a more glorious sunrise than of old</l>
       <l n="75">Drew wondrous melodies from Memnon huge ,</l>
       <l n="76">Yea , draws them still , though now he sits waist-deep</l>
       <l n="77">In the engulfing flood of whirling sand ,</l>
       <l n="78">And looks across the wastes of endless gray ,</l>
       <l n="79">Sole wreck , where once his hundred-gated Thebes</l>
       <l n="80">Pained with her mighty hum the calm , blue heaven .</l>
       <l n="81">Shall the dull stone pay grateful orisons ,</l>
       <l n="82">And we till noonday bar the splendor out ,</l>

       <l n="90">And sunrise , and the yet unshaken dew</l>
       <l n="91">Brimming the chalice of each full-blown hope ,</l>
       <l n="92">Whose blithe front turns to greet the growing day .</l>
       <l n="93">Never had poets such high call before ,</l>
       <l n="94">Never can poets hope for higher one ,</l>
       <l n="95">And , if they be but faithful to their trust ,</l>
       <l n="96">Earth will remember them with love and joy ,</l>
       <l n="97">And O , far better , God will not forget .</l>
       <l n="98">For he who settles Freedom 's principles</l>
       <l n="99">Writes the death-warrant of all tyranny ;</l>
       <l n="100">Who speaks the truth stabs Falsehood to the heart ,</l>
       <l n="101">And his mere word makes despots tremble more</l>
       <l n="102">Than ever Brutus with his dagger could .</l>
       <l n="103">Wait for no hints from waterfalls or woods ,</l>
       <l n="104">Nor dream that tales of red men , brute and fierce ,</l>
       <l n="105">Repay the finding of this Western World ,</l>
       <l n="106">Or needed half the globe to give them birth :</l>
       <l n="107">Spirit supreme of Freedom ! not for this</l>
       <l n="108">Did great Columbus tame his eagle soul</l>
       <l n="109">To jostle with the daws that perch in courts ;</l>
       <l n="110">Not for this , friendless , on an unknown sea ,</l>
       <l n="111">Coping with mad waves and more mutinous spirits ,</l>
       <l n="112">Battled he with the dreadful ache at heart</l>
       <l n="113">Which tempts , with devilish subtleties of doubt ,</l>
       <l n="114">The hermit of that loneliest solitude ,</l>
       <l n="115">The silent desert of a great New Thought ;</l>
       <l n="116">Though loud Niagara were to-day struck dumb ,</l>
       <l n="117">Yet would this cataract of boiling life ,</l>
       <l n="118">Rush plunging on and on to endless deeps</l>
       <l n="119">And utter thunder till the world shall cease ,—</l>
       <l n="120">A thunder worthy of the poet 's song ,</l>
       <l n="121">And which alone can fill it with true life .</l>
       <l n="122">The high evangel to our country granted</l>
       <l n="123">Could make apostles , yea , with tongues of fire ,</l>
       <l n="124">Of hearts half-darkened back again to clay !</l>
       <l n="125">‘ Tis the soul only that is national ,</l>
       <l n="126">And he who pays true loyalty to that</l>

       <l n="1">Down swept the chill wind from the mountain peak ,</l>
       <l n="2">From the snow five thousand summers old ;</l>
       <l n="3">On open wold and hill-top bleak</l>
       <l n="4">It had gathered all the cold ,</l>
       <l n="5">And whirled it like sleet on the wanderer 's cheek</l>
       <l n="6">It carried a shiver everywhere</l>
       <l n="7">From the unleafed boughs and pastures bare ;</l>
       <l n="8">The little brook heard it and built a roof</l>
       <l n="9">‘ Neath which he could house him , winter-proof ;</l>
       <l n="10">All night by the white stars ’ frosty gleams</l>

       <l n="14">He sculptured every summer delight</l>
       <l n="15">In his halls and chambers out of sight ;</l>
       <l n="16">Sometimes his tinkling waters slipt</l>
       <l n="17">Down through a frost-leaved forest-crypt ,</l>
       <l n="18">Long , sparkling aisles of steel-stemmed trees</l>
       <l n="19">Bending to counterfeit a breeze ;</l>

       <l n="21">But silvery mosses that downward grew ;</l>
       <l n="22">Sometimes it was carved in sharp relief</l>
       <l n="23">With quaint arabesques of ice-fern leaf ;</l>
       <l n="24">Sometimes it was simply smooth and clear</l>
       <l n="25">For the gladness of heaven to shine through , and here</l>
       <l n="26">He had caught the nodding bulrush-tops</l>
       <l n="27">And hung them thickly with diamond drops ,</l>
       <l n="28">That crystalled the beams of moon and sun ,</l>

     <p>| Note |.— According to the mythology of the Romancers , the San Greal , or Holy Grail , was the cup out of which Jesus partook of the last supper with his disciples . It was brought into England by Joseph of Arimathea , and remained there , an object of pilgrimage and adoration , for many years in the keeping of his lineal descendants . It was incumbent upon those who had charge of it to be chaste in thought , word , and deed ; but one of the keepers having broken this condition , the Holy Grail disappeared . From that time it was a favorite enterprise of the knights of Arthur 's court to go in search of it . Sir Galahad was at last successful in finding it , as we may read in the seventeenth book of the Romance of King Arthur . Tennyson has made Sir Galahad the subject of one of the most exquisite of his poems .</p>
     <p>The plot ( if I may give that name to anything so slight ) of the foregoing poem is my own , and , to serve its purposes , I have enlarged the circle of competition in search of the miraculous cup in such a manner as to include , not only other persons than the heroes of the Round Table , but also a period of time subsequent to the date of King Arthur 's reign .</p>

     <p>This trifle , begun to please only myself and my own private fancy , was laid on the shelf . But some friends , who had seen it , induced me , by dint of saying they liked it , to put it in print . That is , having come to that very conclusion , I consulted them when it could make no confusion . For , ( though in the gentlest of ways ,) they had hinted it was scarce worth the while , I should doubtless have printed it .</p>
     <p>I began it , intending a Fable , a frail , slender thing , rhyme-ywinged , with a sting in its tail . But , by addings and alterings not previously planned ,— digressions chance-hatched , like birds ’ eggs in the sand ,— and dawdlings to suit every whimsy 's demand , ( always freeing the bird which I held in my hand , for the two perched , perhaps out of reach , in the tree ,) — it grew by degrees to the size which you see . I was like the old woman that carried the calf , and my neighbors , like hers , no doubt , wonder and laugh , and when , my strained arms with their grown burthen full , I call it my Fable , they call it a bull .</p>
     <p>Having scrawled at full gallop ( as far as that goes ) in a style that is neither good verse nor bad prose , and being a person whom nobody knows , some people will say I am rather more free with my readers than it is becoming to be , that I seem to expect them to wait on my leisure in following wherever I wander at pleasure , that , in short , I take more than a young author 's lawful ease , and laugh in a queer way so like Mephistopheles , that the public will doubt , as they grope through my rhythm , if in truth I am making fun at them or with them .</p>
     <p>So the excellent Public is hereby assured that the sale of my book is already secured . For there is not a poet throughout the whole land , but will purchase a copy or two out of hand , in the fond expectation of being amused in it , by seeing his betters cut-up and abused in it . Now , I find , by a pretty exact calculation , there are something like ten thousand bards in the nation , of that special variety whom the Review and Magazine critics call lofty and true , and about thirty thousand ( this tribe is increasing ) of the kinds who are termed full of promise and pleasing . The Public will see by a glance at this schedule , that they cannot expect me to be over-sedulous about courting them , since it seems I have got enough fuel made sure of for boiling my pot .</p>
     <p>As for such of our poets as find not their names mentioned once in my pages , with praises or blames , let them | SEND IN THEIR CARDS |, without further | DELAY |, to my friend | G . P. Putnam |, Esquire , in Broadway , where a | LIST | will be kept with the strictest regard to the day and the hour of receiving the card . Then , taking them up as I chance to have time , ( that is , if their names can be twisted in rhyme ,) I will honestly give each his | PROPER POSITION |, at the rate of | ONE AUTHOR | to each | NEW EDITION |. Thus a PREMIUM is offered sufficiently | HIGH | ( as the magazines say when they tell their best lie ) to induce bards to | CLUB | their resources and buy the balance of every edition , until they have all of them fairly been run through the mill .</p>
     <p>One word to such readers ( judicious and wise ) as read books with something behind the mere eyes , of whom in the country , perhaps , there are two , including myself , gentle reader , and you . All the characters sketched in this slight jeu d'esprit , though , it may be , they seem , here and there , rather free , and drawn from a Mephistophelian stand-point , are meant to be faithful , and that is the grand point , and none but an owl would feel sore at a rub from a jester who tells you , without any subterfuge , that he sits in Diogenes ’ tub .</p>
     <p>A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION ,</p>
     <p>though it well may be reckoned , of all composition , the species at once most delightful and healthy , is a thing which an author , unless he be wealthy and willing to pay for that kind of delight , is not , in all instances , called on to write . Though there are , it is said , who , their spirits to cheer , slip in a new title-page three times a year , and in this way snuff up an imaginary savor of that sweetest of dishes , the popular favor ,— much as if a starved painter should fall to and treat the Ugolino inside to a picture of meat .</p>
     <p>You remember ( if not , pray turn over and look ) that , in writing the preface which ushered my book , I treated you , excellent Public , not merely with a cool disregard , but downright cavalierly . Now I would not take back the least thing I then said , though I thereby could butter both sides of my bread , for I never could see that an author owed aught to the people he solaced , diverted , or taught ; and , as for mere fame , I have long ago learned that the persons by whom it is finally earned , are those with whom your verdict weighed not a pin , unsustained by the higher court sitting within .</p>
     <p>But I wander from what I intended to say — that you have , namely , shown such a liberal way of thinking , and so much aesthetic perception of anonymous worth in the handsome reception you gave to my book , spite of some private piques , ( having bought the first thousand in barely two weeks ,) that I think , past a doubt , if you measured the phiz of your 's most devotedly , Wonderful Quiz , you would find that its vertical section was shorter , by an inch and two tenths , or ‘ twixt that and a quarter .</p>
     <p>You have watched a child playing — in those wondrous years when belief is not bound to the eyes and the ears , and the vision divine is so clear and unmarred , that each baker of pies in the dirt is a bard ? Give a knife and a shingle , he fits out a fleet , and , on that little mud puddle over the street , his invention , in purest good faith , will make sail round the globe with a puff of his breath for a gale , will visit , in barely ten minutes , all climes , and find Northwestern passages hundreds of times . Or , suppose the young Poet fresh stored with delights from that Bible of childhood the Arabian Nights , he will turn to a crony and cry , “ Jack , let 's play that I am a Genius ! ” Jacky straightway makes Aladdin 's lamp out of a stone , and , for hours , they enjoy each his own supernatural powers . This is all very pretty and pleasant , but then suppose our two urchins have grown into men , and both have turned authors ,— one says to his brother , “ Let 's play we 're the American somethings or other , ( only let them be big enough , no matter what . ) Come , you shall be Goethe or Pope , which you choose ; I 'll be Coleridge , and both shall write mutual reviews . ” So they both ( as mere strangers ) before many days , send each other a cord of anonymous bays . Each , in piling his epithets , smiles in his sleeve to see what his friend can be made to believe ; each , in reading the other 's unbiased review , thinks — Here 's pretty high praise , but no more than is true . Well , we laugh at them both , and yet make no great fuss when the same farce is acted to benefit us . Even I , who , if asked , scarce a month since , what Fudge meant , should have answered , the dear Public 's critical judgment , begin to think sharpwitted Horace spoke sooth when he said , that the Public sometimes hit the truth .</p>
     <p>In reading these lines , you perhaps have a vision of a person in pretty good health and condition , and yet , since I put forth my primary edition , I have been crushed , scorched , withered , used up and put down , ( by Smith with the cordial assistance of Brown ,) in all , if you put any faith in my rhymes , to the number of ninety-five several times , and , while I am writing — I tremble to think of it , for I may at this moment be just on the brink of it — Molybdostom , angry at being omitted , has begun a critique ,— am I not to be pitied ? [ B ]</p>
<note>Footnote B : The wise Scandinavians probably called their bards by the queer-looking title of Scald , in a delicate way , as it were , just to hint to the world the hot water they always get into .</note>     <note xml:id="noteB" place="bottom" n="B">The wise Scandinavians probably called their bards by the queer-looking title of Scald , in a delicate way , as it were , just to hint to the world the hot water they always get into .</note>
     <p>Now I shall not crush them since , indeed , for that matter , no pressure I know of could render them flatter ; nor wither , nor scorch them ,— no action of fire could make either them or their articles drier ; nor waste time in putting them down — I am thinking not their own self-inflation will keep them from sinking ; for there 's this contradiction about the whole bevy — though without the least weight , they are awfully heavy . No , my dear honest bore , surdo fabulam narras , they are no more to me than a rat in the arras . I can walk with the Doctor , get facts from the Don , or draw out the Lambish quintessence of John , and feel nothing more than a half-comic sorrow , to think that they all will be lying to-morrow tossed carelessly up on the waste-paper shelves , and forgotten by all but their half-dozen selves . Once snug in my attic , my fire in a roar , I leave the whole pack of them outside the door . With Hakluyt or Purchas I wander away to the black northern seas or barbaric Cathay ; get fou with O'Shanter , and sober me then with that builder of brick-kilnish dramas , rare Ben ; snuff Herbert , as holy as a flower on a grave ; with Fletcher wax tender , o'er Chapman grow brave ; with Marlowe or Kyd take a fine poet-rave ; in Very , most Hebrew of Saxons , find peace ; with Lycidas welter on vext Irish seas ; with Webster grow wild , and climb earthward again , down by mystical Browne 's Jacob'shYpppHeNladderhYpppHeNlike brain , to that spiritual Pepys ( Cotton 's version ) Montaigne ; find a new depth in Wordsworth , undreamed of before ,— that divinely-inspired , wise , deep , tender , grand ,— bore . Or , out of my study , the scholar thrown off , nature holds up her shield ‘ gainst the sneer and the scoff ; the landscape , forever consoling and kind , pours her wine and her oil on the smarts of the mind . The waterfall , scattering its vanishing gems ; the tall grove of hemlocks , with moss on their stems , like plashes of sunlight ; the pond in the woods , where no foot but mine and the bittern 's intrudes ; these are all my kind neighbors , and leave me no wish to say aught to you all , my poor critics , but — pish ! I have buried the hatchet ; I am twisting an allumette out of one of you now , and relighting my calumet . In your private capacities , come when you please , I will give you my hand and a fresh pipe a-piece .</p>
     <p>As I ran through the leaves of my poor little book , to take a fond author 's first tremulous look , it was quite an excitement to hunt the errata , sprawled in as birds ’ tracks are in some kinds of strata , ( only these made things crookeder . ) Fancy an heir , that a father had seen born well-featured and fair , turning suddenly wry-nosed , club-footed , squint-eyed , hare-lipped , wapper-jawed , carrot-haired , from a pride become an aversion ,— my case was yet worse . A club-foot ( by way of a change ) in a verse , I might have forgiven , an o 's being wry , a limp in an e , or a cock in an i ,— but to have the sweet babe of my brain served in pi ! I am not queasy-stomached , but such a Thyestean banquet as that was quite out of the question .</p>
     <p>In the edition now issued , no pains are neglected , and my verses , as orators say , stand corrected . Yet some blunders remain of the public 's own make , which I wish to correct for my personal sake . For instance , a character drawn in pure fun and condensing the traits of a dozen in one , has been , as I hear by some persons applied to a good friend of mine , whom to stab in the side , as we walked along chatting and joking together , would not be my way . I can hardly tell whether a question will ever arise in which he and I should by any strange fortune agree , but meanwhile my esteem for him grows as I know him , and , though not the best judge upon earth of a poem , he knows what it is he is saying and why , and is honest and fearless , two good points which I have not found so rife I can easily smother my love for them , whether on my side or t'other .</p>
     <p>For my other anonymi , you may be sure that I know what is meant by a caricature , and what by a portrait . There are those who think it is capital fun to be spattering their ink on quiet unquarrelsome folk , but the minute the game changes sides and the others begin it , they see something savage and horrible in it . As for me I respect neither women nor men for their gender , nor own any sex in a pen . I choose just to hint to some causeless unfriends that , as far as I know , there are always two ends ( and one of them heaviest , too ) to a staff , and two parties also to every good laugh .</p>

       <l n="1">Phoebus , sitting one day in a laurel-tree 's shade ,</l>
       <l n="2">Was reminded of Daphne , of whom it was made ,</l>
       <l n="3">For the god being one day too warm in his wooing ,</l>
       <l n="4">She took to the tree to escape his pursuing ;</l>
       <l n="5">Be the cause what it might , from his offers she shrunk ,</l>

       <l n="17">Then the poet was prophet , the past in his soul</l>
       <l n="18">Pre-created the future , both parts of one whole ;</l>
       <l n="19">Then for him there was nothing too great or too small ,</l>

       <l n="35">As once with her lips , lifted hands , and eyes listening ,</l>

       <l n="37">Eurydice stood — like a beacon unfired ,</l>
       <l n="38">Which , once touch 'd with flame , will leap heav'nward inspired —</l>

       <l n="40">The first gleam of Orpheus that pained the red Dark .</l>

      <head>THE BIGLOW PAPERS .</head>
      <head>NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS .</head>
      <note>I have observed , reader , ( bene - or male-volent , as it may happen ,) that it is customary to append to the second editions of books , and to the second works of authors , short sentences commendatory of the first , under the title of Notices of the Press . These , I have been given to understand , are procurable at certain established rates , payment being made either in money or advertising patronage by the publisher , or by an adequate outlay of servility on the part of the author . Considering these things with myself , and also that such notices are neither intended , nor generally believed , to convey any real opinions , being a purely ceremonial accompaniment of literature , and resembling certificates to the virtues of various morbiferal panaceas , I conceived that it would be not only more economical to prepare a sufficient number of such myself , but also more immediately subservient to the end in view to prefix them to this our primary edition rather than await the contingency of a second , when they would seem to be of small utility . To delay attaching the bobs until the second attempt at flying the kite , would indicate but a slender experience in that useful art . Neither has it escaped my notice , nor failed to afford me matter of reflection , that , when a circus or a caravan is about to visit Jaalam , the initial step is to send forward large and highly ornamented bills of performance to be hung in the bar-room and the post-office . These having been sufficiently gazed at , and beginning to lose their attractiveness except for the flies , and , truly , the boys also , ( in whom I find it impossible to repress , even during school-hours , certain oral and telegraphic communications concerning the expected show ,) upon some fine morning the band enters in a gayly-painted wagon , or triumphal chariot , and with noisy advertisement , by means of brass , wood , and sheepskin , makes the circuit of our startled village-streets . Then , as the exciting sounds draw nearer and nearer , do I desiderate those eyes of Aristarchus , “ whose looks were as a breeching to a boy . ” Then do I perceive , with vain regret of wasted opportunities , the advantage of a pancratic or pantechnic education , since he is most reverenced by my little subjects who can throw the cleanest summerset or walk most securely upon the revolving cask . The story of the Pied Piper becomes for the first time credible to me , ( albeit confirmed by the Hameliners dating their legal instruments from the period of his exit ,) as I behold how those strains , without pretence of magical potency , bewitch the pupillary legs , nor leave to the pedagogic an entire self-control . For these reasons , lest my kingly prerogative should suffer diminution , I prorogue my restless commons , whom I also follow into the street , chiefly lest some mischief may chance befall them . After the manner of such a band , I send forward the following notices of domestic manufacture , to make brazen proclamation , not unconscious of the advantage which will accrue , if our little craft , cymbula sutilis , shall seem to leave port with a clipping breeze , and to carry , in nautical phrase , a bone in her mouth . Nevertheless , I have chosen , as being more equitable , to prepare some also sufficiently objurgatory , that readers of every taste may find a dish to their palate . I have modelled them upon actually existing specimens , preserved in my own cabinet of natural curiosities . One , in particular , I had copied with tolerable exactness from a notice of one of my own discourses , which , from its superior tone and appearance of vast experience , I concluded to have been written by a man at least three hundred years of age , though I recollected no existing instance of such antediluvian longevity . Nevertheless , I afterwards discovered the author to be a young gentleman preparing for the ministry under the direction of one of my brethren in a neighboring town , and whom I had once instinctively corrected in a Latin quantity . But this I have been forced to omit , from its too great length .— H . W .</note>
       <l n="1">From the Universal Littery Universe .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Full of passages which rivet the attention of the reader .... Under a rustic garb , sentiments are conveyed which should be committed to the memory and engraven on the heart of every moral and social being .... We consider this a unique performance .... We hope to see it soon introduced into our common schools .... Mr. Wilbur has performed his duties as editor with excellent taste and judgment .... This is a vein which we hope to see successfully prosecuted .... We hail the appearance of this work as a long stride toward the formation of a purely aboriginal , indigenous , native , and American literature . We rejoice to meet with an author national enough to break away from the slavish deference , too common among us , to English grammar and orthography .... Where all is so good , we are at a loss how to make extracts .... On the whole , we may call it a volume which no library , pretending to entire completeness , should fail to place upon its shelves .</p>
     <p>From the Higginbottomopolis Snapping-turtle .</p>
     <p>A collection of the merest balderdash and doggerel that it was ever our bad fortune to lay eyes on . The author is a vulgar buffoon , and the editor a talkative , tedious old fool . We use strong language , but should any of our readers peruse the book , ( from which calamity Heaven preserve them ! ) they will find reasons for it thick as the leaves of Vallumbrozer , or , to use a still more expressive comparison , as the combined heads of author and editor . The work is wretchedly got up .... We should like to know how much British gold was pocketed by this libeller of our country and her purest patriots .</p>
     <p>From the Oldfogrumville Mentor .</p>
     <p>We have not had time to do more than glance through this handsomely printed volume , but the name of its respectable editor , the Rev . Mr. Wilbur , of Jaalam , will afford a sufficient guaranty for the worth of its contents .... The paper is white , the type clear , and the volume of a convenient and attractive size .... In reading this elegantly executed work , it has seemed to us that a passage or two might have been retrenched with advantage , and that the general style of diction was susceptible of a higher polish .... On the whole , we may safely leave the ungrateful task of criticism to the reader . We will barely suggest , that in volumes intended , as this is , for the illustration of a provincial dialect and turns of expression , a dash of humor or satire might be thrown in with advantage .... The work is admirably got up .... This work will form an appropriate ornament to the centre-table . It is beautifully printed , on paper of an excellent quality .</p>
     <p>From the Dekay Bulwark .</p>
     <p>We should be wanting in our duty as the conductor of that tremendous engine , a public press , as an American , and as a man , did we allow such an opportunity as is presented to us by “ The Biglow Papers ” to pass by without entering our earnest protest against such attempts ( now , alas ! too common ) at demoralizing the public sentiment . Under a wretched mask of stupid drollery , slavery , war , the social glass , and , in short , all the valuable and time-honored institutions justly dear to our common humanity and especially to republicans , are made the butt of coarse and senseless ribaldry by this low-minded scribbler . It is time that the respectable and religious portion of our community should be aroused to the alarming inroads of foreign Jacobinism , sans-culottism , and infidelity . It is a fearful proof of the wide-spread nature of this contagion , that these secret stabs at religion and virtue are given from under the cloak ( credite , posteri ! ) of a clergyman . It is a mournful spectacle indeed to the patriot and Christian to see liberality and new ideas ( falsely so called ,— they are as old as Eden ) invading the sacred precincts of the pulpit .... On the whole , we consider this volume as one of the first shocking results which we predicted would spring out of the late French “ Revolution ” (! ) .</p>
     <p>From the Bungtown Copper and Comprehensive Tocsin ( a try-weakly family journal ) .</p>
     <p>Altogether an admirable work .... Full of humor , boisterous , but delicate — of wit withering and scorching , yet combined with a pathos cool as morning dew ,— of satire ponderous as the mace of Richard , yet keen as the scymitar of Saladin .... A work full of “ mountain-mirth , ” mischievous as Puck and lightsome as Ariel .... We know not whether to admire most the genial , fresh , and discursive concinnity of the author , or his playful fancy , weird imagination , and compass of style , at once both objective and subjective .... We might indulge in some criticisms , but were the author other than he is , he would be a different being . As it is , he has a wonderful pose , which flits from flower to flower , and bears the reader irresistibly along on its eagle pinions ( like Ganymede ) to the “ highest heaven of invention . ” ... We love a book so purely objective .... Many of his pictures of natural scenery have an extraordinary subjective clearness and fidelity .... In fine , we consider this as one of the most extraordinary volumes of this or any age . We know of no English author who could have written it . It is a work to which the proud genius of our country , standing with one foot on the Aroostook and the other on the Rio Grande , and holding up the star-spangled banner amid the wreck of matter and the crush of worlds , may point with bewildering scorn of the punier efforts of enslaved Europe .... We hope soon to encounter our author among those higher walks of literature in which he is evidently capable of achieving enduring fame . Already we should be inclined to assign him a high position in the bright galaxy of our American bards .</p>
     <p>From the Saltriver Pilot and Flag of Freedom .</p>
     <p>A volume in bad grammar and worse taste .... While the pieces here collected were confined to their appropriate sphere in the corners of obscure newspapers , we considered them wholly beneath contempt , but , as the author has chosen to come forward in this public manner , he must expect the lash he so richly merits .... Contemptible slanders .... Vilest Billingsgate .... Has raked all the gutters of our language .... The most pure , upright , and consistent politicians not safe from his malignant venom .... General Cushing comes in for a share of his vile calumnies .... The Reverend Homer Wilbur is a disgrace to his cloth ....</p>
     <p>From the World-Harmonic-AEolian-Attachment .</p>
     <p>Speech is silver : silence is golden . No utterance more Orphic than this . While , therefore , as highest author , we reverence him whose works continue heroically unwritten , we have also our hopeful word for those who with pen ( from wing of goose loud-cackling , or seraph God-commissioned ) record the thing that is revealed .... Under mask of quaintest irony , we detect here the deep , storm-tost ( nigh shipwracked ) soul , thunder-scarred , semiarticulate , but ever climbing hopefully toward the peaceful summits of an Infinite Sorrow .... Yes , thou poor , forlorn Hosea , with Hebrew fire-flaming soul in thee , for thee also this life of ours has not been without its aspects of heavenliest pity and laughingest mirth . Conceivable enough ! Through coarse Thersites-cloak , we have revelation of the heart , wild-glowing , world-clasping , that is in him . Bravely he grapples with the life-problem as it presents itself to him , uncombed , shaggy , careless of the “ nicer proprieties , ” inexpert of “ elegant diction , ” yet with voice audible enough to whoso hath ears , up there on the gravelly side-hills , or down on the splashy , Indiarubber-like salt-marshes of native Jaalam . To this soul also the Necessity of Creating somewhat has unveiled its awful front . If not OEdipuses and Electras and Alcestices , then in God 's name Birdofredum Sawins ! These also shall get born into the world , and filch ( if so need ) a Zingali subsistence therein , these lank , omnivorous Yankees of his . He shall paint the Seen , since the Unseen will not sit to him . Yet in him also are Nibelungen-lays , and Iliads , and Ulysses-wanderings , and Divine Comedies ,— if only once he could come at them ! Therein lies much , nay all ; for what truly is this which we name All , but that which we do not possess ?... Glimpses also are given us of an old father Ezekiel , not without paternal pride , as is the wont of such . A brown , parchment-hided old man of the geoponic or bucolic species , gray-eyed , we fancy , queued perhaps , with much weather-cunning and plentiful September-gale memories , bidding fair in good time to become the Oldest Inhabitant . After such hasty apparition , he vanishes and is seen no more .... Of “ Rev . Homer Wilbur , A. M ., Pastor of the First Church in Jaalam , ” we have small care to speak here . Spare touch in him of his Melesigenes namesake , save , haply , the — blindness ! A tolerably caliginose , nephelegeretous elderly gentleman , with infinite faculty of sermonizing , muscularized by long practice , and excellent digestive apparatus , and , for the rest , well-meaning enough , and with small private illuminations ( somewhat tallowy , it is to be feared ) of his own . To him , there , “ Pastor of the First Church in Jaalam , ” our Hosea presents himself as a quite inexplicable Sphinx-riddle . A rich poverty of Latin and Greek ,— so far is clear enough , even to eyes peering myopic through horn-lensed editorial spectacles ,— but naught farther ? O purblind , well-meaning , altogether fuscous Melesigenes-Wilbur , there are things in him incommunicable by stroke of birch ! Did it ever enter that old bewildered head of thine that there was the Possibility of the Infinite in him ? To thee , quite wingless ( and even featherless ) biped , has not so much even as a dream of wings ever come ? “ Talented young parishioner ” ? Among the Arts whereof thou art Magister , does that of seeing happen to be one ? Unhappy Artium Magister ! Somehow a Nemean lion , fulvous , torrid-eyed , dry-nursed in broad-howling sand-wildernesses of a sufficiently rare spirit-Libya ( it may be supposed ) has got whelped among the sheep . Already he stands wild-glaring , with feet clutching the ground as with oak-roots , gathering for a Remus-spring over the walls of thy little fold . In Heaven 's name , go not near him with that flybite crook of thine ! In good time , thou painful preacher , thou wilt go to the appointed place of departed Artillery-Election Sermons , Right-Hands of Fellowship , and Results of Councils , gathered to thy spiritual fathers with much Latin of the Epitaphial sort ; thou , too , shalt have thy reward ; but on him the Eumenides have looked , not Xantippes of the pit , snake-tressed , finger-threatening , but radiantly calm as on antique gems ; for him paws impatient the winged courser of the gods , champing unwelcome bit ; him the starry deeps , the empyrean glooms , and far-flashing splendors await .</p>
     <p>From the Onion Grove Phoenix .</p>
     <p>A talented young townsman of ours , recently returned from a Continental tour , and who is already favorably known to our readers by his sprightly letters from abroad which have graced our columns , called at our office yesterday . We learn from him , that , having enjoyed the distinguished privilege , while in Germany , of an introduction to the celebrated Von Humbug , he took the opportunity to present that eminent man with a copy of the “ Biglow Papers . ” The next morning he received the following note , which he has kindly furnished us for publication . We prefer to print it verbatim , knowing that our readers will readily forgive the few errors into which the illustrious writer has fallen , through ignorance of our language .</p>
     <p>“ | High-Worthy Mister |!</p>
     <p>“ I shall also now especially happy starve , because I have more or less a work of one those aboriginal Red-Men seen in which I have so deaf an interest ever taken fullworthy on the self shelf with our Gottsched to be upset .</p>
     <p>“ Pardon my in the English-speech unpractice !</p>
     <p>“ | Von Humbug .| ”</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">He also sent with the above note a copy of his famous work on</l>
       <l n="2">“ Cosmetics , ” to be presented to Mr. Biglow ; but this was taken from our</l>
       <l n="3">friend by the English custom-house officers , probably through a petty</l>
       <l n="4">national spite . No doubt , it has by this time found its way into the</l>
       <l n="5">British Museum . We trust this outrage will be exposed in all our</l>
       <l n="6">American papers . We shall do our best to bring it to the notice of the</l>
       <l n="7">State Department . Our numerous readers will share in the pleasure we</l>
       <l n="8">experience at seeing our young and vigorous national literature thus</l>
       <l n="9">encouragingly patted on the head by this venerable and world-renowned</l>
       <l n="10">German . We love to see these reciprocations of good-feeling between the</l>
       <l n="11">different branches of the great Anglo-Saxon race .</l>
     </lg>
     <note>The following genuine “ notice ” having met my eye I gladly insert a portion of it here , the more especially as it contains one of Mr. Biglow 's poems not elsewhere printed .— H . W .</note>
     <p>From the Jaalam Independent Blunderbuss .</p>
     <p>... But , while we lament to see our young townsman thus mingling in the heated contests of party politics , we think we detect in him the presence of talents which , if properly directed , might give an innocent pleasure to many . As a proof that he is competent to the production of other kinds of poetry , we copy for our readers a short fragment of a pastoral by him , the manuscript of which was loaned us by a friend . The title of it is “ The Courtin ’ . ”</p>

       <l n="1">| Lectori Benevolo S .|</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Toga scholastica nondum deposita , quum systemata varia entomologica , a viris ejus scientiae cultoribus studiosissimis summa diligentia aedificata , penitus indagassem , non fuit quin luctuose omnibus in iis , quamvis aliter laude dignissimis , hiatum magni momenti perciperem . Tunc , nescio quo motu superiore impulsus , aut qua captus dulcedine operis , ad eum implendum ( Curtius alter ) me solemniter devovi . Nec ab isto labore , daimonios imposito , abstinui antequam tractatulum sufficienter inconcinnum lingua vernacula perfeceram . Inde , juveniliter tumefactus , et barathro ineptiae ton bibliopolon ( necnon “ Publici Legentis ” ) nusquam explorato , me composuisse quod quasi placentas praefervidas ( ut sic dicam ) homines ingurgitarent credidi . Sed , quum huic et alio bibliopolae MSS . mea submisissem et nihil solidius responsione valde negativa in Musaeum meum retulissem , horror ingens atque misericordia , ob crassitudinem Lambertianam in cerebris homunculorum istius muneris coelesti quadam ira infixam , me invasere . Extemplo mei solius impensis librum edere decrevi , nihil omnino dubitans quin “ Mundus Scientificus ” ( ut aiunt ) crumenam meam ampliter repleret . Nullam , attamen , ex agro illo meo parvulo segetem demessui , praeter gaudium vacuum bene de Republica merendi . Iste panis meus pretiosus super aquas literarias faeculentas praefidenter jactus , quasi Harpyiarum quarundam ( scilicet bibliopolarum istorum facinorosorum supradictorum ) tactu rancidus , intra perpaucos dies mihi domum rediit . Et , quum ipse tali victu ali non tolerarem , primum in mentem venit pistori ( typographo nempe ) nihilominus solvendum esse . Animum non idcirco demisi , imo aeque ac pueri naviculas suas penes se lino retinent ( eo ut e recto cursu delapsas ad ripam retrahant ) , sic ego Argo meam chartaceam fluctibus laborantem a quaesitu velleris aurei , ipse potius tonsus pelleque exutus , mente solida revocavi . Metaphoram ut mutem , boomarangam meam a scopo aberrantem retraxi , dum majore vi , occasione ministrante , adversus Fortunam intorquerem . Ast mihi , talia volventi , et , sicut Saturnus ille paidoboros , liberos intellectus mei depascere fidenti , casus miserandus , nec antea inauditus , supervenit . Nam , ut ferunt Scythas pietatis causa et parsimoniae , parentes suos mortuos devorasse , sic filius hic meus primogenitus , Scythis ipsis minus mansuetus , patrem vivum totum et calcitrantem exsorbere enixus est . Nec tamen hac de causa sobolem meam esurientem exheredavi . Sed famem istam pro valido testimonio virilitatis roborisque potius habui , cibumque ad eam satiandam , salva paterna mea carne , petii . Et quia bilem illam scaturientem ad aes etiam concoquendum idoneam esse estimabam , unde aes alienum , ut minoris pretii , haberem , circumspexi . Rebus ita se habentibus , ab avunculo meo Johanne Doolittle , Armigero , impetravi ut pecunias necessarias suppeditaret , ne opus esset mihi universitatem relinquendi antequam ad gradum primum in artibus pervenissem . Tunc ego , salvum facere patronum meum munificum maxime cupiens , omnes libros primae editionis operis mei non venditos una cum privilegio in omne aevum ejusdem imprimendi et edendi avunculo meo dicto pigneravi . Ex illo die , atro lapide notando , curae vociferantes familiae singulis annis crescentis eo usque insultabant ut nunquam tam carum pignus e vinculis istis aheneis solvere possem .</p>
     <p>Avunculo vero nuper mortuo , quum inter alios consanguineos testamenti ejus lectionem audiendi causa advenissem , erectis auribus verba talia sequentia accepi :— “ Quoniam persuasum habeo meum dilectum nepotem Homerum , longa et intima rerum angustarum domi experientia , aptissimum esse qui divitias tueatur , beneficenterque ac prudenter iis divinis creditis utatur ,— ergo , motus hisce cogitationibus , exque amore meo in ilium magno , do , legoque nepoti caro meo supranominato omnes singularesque istas possessiones nec ponderabiles nec computabiles meas quae sequuntur , scilicet : quingentos libros quos mihi pigneravit dictus Homerus , anno lucis 1792 , cum privilegio edendi et repetendi opus istud ‘ scientificum ’ ( quod dicunt ) suum , si sic elegerit . Tamen D. O. M. precor oculos Homeri nepotis mei ita aperiat eumque moveat , ut libros istos in bibliotheca unius e plurimis castellis suis Hispaniensibus tuto abscondat . ”</p>
     <p>His verbis ( vix credibilibus ) auditis , cor meum in pectore exsultavit . Deinde , quoniam tractatus Anglice scriptus spem auctoris fefellerat , quippe quum studium Historiae Naturalis in Republica nostra inter factionis strepitum languescat , Latine versum edere statui , et eo potius quia nescio quomodo disciplina academica et duo diplomata proficiant , nisi quod peritos linguarum omnino mortuarum ( et damnandarum , ut dicebat iste panourgos Gulielmus Cobbett ) nos faciant .</p>
     <p>Et mihi adhuc superstes est tota ilia editio prima , quam quasi crepitaculum per quod dentes caninos dentibam retineo .</p>

     <p>NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE .</p>
     <p>It will not have escaped the attentive eye , that I have , on the title-page , omitted those honorary appendages to the editorial name which not only add greatly to the value of every book , but whet and exacerbate the appetite of the reader . For not only does he surmise that an honorary membership of literary and scientific societies implies a certain amount of necessary distinction on the part of the recipient of such decorations , but he is willing to trust himself more entirely to an author who writes under the fearful responsibility of involving the reputation of such bodies as the S. Archoel . Dahom ., or the Acad . Lit . et Scient . Kamtschat . I cannot but think that the early editions of Shakspeare and Milton would have met with more rapid and general acceptance , but for the barrenness of their respective title-pages ; and I believe , that , even now , a publisher of the works of either of those justly distinguished men would find his account in procuring their admission to the membership of learned bodies on the Continent ,— a proceeding no whit more incongruous than the reversal of the judgment against Socrates , when he was already more than twenty centuries beyond the reach of antidotes , and when his memory had acquired a deserved respectability . I conceive that it was a feeling of the importance of this precaution which induced Mr. Locke to style himself “ Gent . ” on the title-page of his Essay , as who should say to his readers that they could receive his metaphysics on the honor of a gentleman .</p>
     <p>Nevertheless , finding that , without descending to a smaller size of type than would have been compatible with the dignity of the several societies to be named , I could not compress my intended list within the limits of a single page , and thinking , moreover , that the act would carry with it an air of decorous modesty , I have chosen to take the reader aside , as it were , into my private closet , and there not only exhibit to him the diplomas which I already possess , but also to furnish him with a prophetic vision of those which I may , without undue presumption , hope for , as not beyond the reach of human ambition and attainment . And I am the rather induced to this from the fact , that my name has been unaccountably dropped from the last triennial catalogue of our beloved Alma Mater . Whether this is to be attributed to the difficulty of Latinizing any of those honorary adjuncts ( with a complete list of which I took care to furnish the proper persons nearly a year beforehand ) , or whether it had its origin in any more culpable motives , I forbear to consider in this place , the matter being in course of painful investigation . But , however this may be , I felt the omission the more keenly , as I had , in expectation of the new catalogue , enriched the library of the Jaalam Athenaeum with the old one then in my possession , by which means it has come about that my children will be deprived of a never-wearying winter evening 's amusement in looking out the name of their parent in that distinguished roll . Those harmless innocents had at least committed no — but I forbear , having intrusted my reflections and animadversions on this painful topic to the safe-keeping of my private diary , intended for posthumous publication . I state this fact here , in order that certain nameless individuals , who are , perhaps , overmuch congratulating themselves on my silence , may know that a rod is in pickle which the vigorous hand of a justly incensed posterity will apply to their memories .</p>
     <p>The careful reader will note , that , in the list which I have prepared , I have included the names of several Cisatlantic societies to which a place is not commonly assigned in processions of this nature . I have ventured to do this , not only to encourage native ambition and genius , but also because I have never been able to perceive in what way distance ( unless we suppose them at the end of a lever ) could increase the weight of learned bodies . As far as I have been able to extend my researches among such stuffed specimens as occasionally reach America , I have discovered no generic difference between the antipodal Fogrum Japonicum and the F. Americanum sufficiently common in our own immediate neighborhood . Yet , with a becoming deference to the popular belief that distinctions of this sort are enhanced in value by every additional mile they travel , I have intermixed the names of some tolerably distant literary and other associations with the rest .</p>
     <p>I add here , also , an advertisement , which , that it may be the more readily understood by those persons especially interested therein , I have written in that curtailed and otherwise maltreated canine Latin , to the writing and reading of which they are accustomed .</p>

     <p>INTRODUCTION .</p>
     <p>When , more than three years ago , my talented young parishioner , Mr. Biglow , came to me and submitted to my animadversions the first of his poems which he intended to commit to the more hazardous trial of a city newspaper , it never so much as entered my imagination to conceive that his productions would ever be gathered into a fair volume , and ushered into the august presence of the reading public by myself . So little are we short-sighted mortals able to predict the event ! I confess that there is to me a quite new satisfaction in being associated ( though only as sleeping partner ) in a book which can stand by itself in an independent unity on the shelves of libraries . For there is always this drawback from the pleasure of printing a sermon , that , whereas the queasy stomach of this generation will not bear a discourse long enough to make a separate volume , those religious and godly-minded children ( those Samuels , if I may call them so ) of the brain must at first lie buried in an undistinguished heap , and then get such resurrection as is vouchsafed to them , mummy-wrapt with a score of others in a cheap binding , with no other mark of distinction than the word “ Miscellaneous ” printed upon the back . Far be it from me to claim any credit for the quite unexpected popularity which I am pleased to find these bucolic strains have attained unto . If I know myself , I am measurably free from the itch of vanity ; yet I may be allowed to say that I was not backward to recognize in them a certain wild , puckery , acidulous ( sometimes even verging toward that point which , in our rustic phrase , is termed shut-eye ) flavor , not wholly unpleasing , nor unwholesome , to palates cloyed with the sugariness of tamed and cultivated fruit . It may be , also , that some touches of my own , here and there , may have led to their wider acceptance , albeit solely from my larger experience of literature and authorship . [ J ]</p>

     <p>I was , at first , inclined to discourage Mr. Biglow 's attempts , as knowing that the desire to poetize is one of the diseases naturally incident to adolescence , which , if the fitting remedies be not at once and with a bold hand applied , may become chronic , and render one , who might else have become in due time an ornament of the social circle , a painful object even to nearest friends and relatives . But thinking , on a further experience , that there was a germ of promise in him which required only culture and the pulling up of weeds from around it , I thought it best to set before him the acknowledged examples of English composition in verse , and leave the rest to natural emulation . With this view , I accordingly lent him some volumes of Pope and Goldsmith , to the assiduous study of which he promised to devote his evenings . Not long afterward , he brought me some verses written upon that model , a specimen of which I subjoin , having changed some phrases of less elegancy , and a few rhymes objectionable to the cultivated ear . The poem consisted of childish reminiscences , and the sketches which follow will not seem destitute of truth to those whose fortunate education began in a country village . And , first , let us hang up his charcoal portrait of the school-dame .</p>

       <l n="1">“ Propt on the marsh , a dwelling now , I see</l>
       <l n="2">The humble school-house of my A , B , C ,</l>
       <l n="3">Where well-drilled urchins , each behind his tire ,</l>
       <l n="4">Waited in ranks the wished command to fire ,</l>
       <l n="5">Then all together , when the signal came ,</l>
       <l n="6">Discharged their a-b abs against the dame .</l>
       <l n="7">Daughter of Danaus , who could daily pour</l>
       <l n="8">In treacherous pipkins her Pierian store ,</l>
       <l n="9">She , mid the volleyed learning firm and calm</l>
       <l n="10">Patted the furloughed ferule on her palm ,</l>
       <l n="11">And , to our wonder , could divine at once</l>
       <l n="12">Who flashed the pan , and who was downright dunce .</l>

       <l n="16">Who soonest to the topmost twig perspired ;</l>

       <l n="18">As pleased the reader 's ear on different days ,</l>
       <l n="19">So that the weather , or the ferule 's stings ,</l>
       <l n="20">Colds in the head , or fifty other things ,</l>
       <l n="21">Transformed the helpless Hebrew thrice a week</l>
       <l n="22">To guttural Pequot or resounding Greek ,</l>
       <l n="23">The vibrant accent skipping here and there ,</l>
       <l n="24">Just as it pleased invention or despair ;</l>
       <l n="25">No controversial Hebraist was the Dame ;</l>
       <l n="26">With or without the points pleased her the same ;</l>
       <l n="27">If any tyro found a name too tough ,</l>
       <l n="28">And looked at her , pride furnished skill enough ;</l>
       <l n="29">She nerved her larynx for the desperate thing ,</l>

       <l n="34">A drone , the envy of compulsory bees ;</l>

       <l n="38">About my neck — to be restored next day ,</l>
       <l n="39">I carried home , rewards as shining then</l>
       <l n="40">As those which deck the lifelong pains of men ,</l>

       <l n="47">The impromptu pinbent hook , the deep remorse</l>

       <l n="56">Shared with the dog , whose most beseeching tail</l>
       <l n="57">And dripping tongue and eager ears belied</l>

       <l n="59">The caper homeward , shortened if the cart</l>

       <l n="61">O'ertook me ,— then , translated to the seat</l>

       <l n="64">Explained where horses should be thick , where thin ,</l>
       <l n="65">And warned me ( joke he always had in store )</l>
       <l n="66">To shun a beast that four white stockings wore .</l>
       <l n="67">What a fine natural courtesy was his !</l>
       <l n="68">His nod was pleasure , and his full bow bliss ;</l>
       <l n="69">How did his well-thumbed hat , with ardor rapt ,</l>
       <l n="70">Its decorous curve to every rank adapt !</l>
       <l n="71">How did it graduate with a courtly ease</l>
       <l n="72">The whole long scale of social differences ,</l>
       <l n="73">Yet so gave each his measure running o'er ,</l>
       <l n="74">None thought his own was less , his neighbor 's more ;</l>
       <l n="75">The squire was flattered , and the pauper knew</l>
       <l n="76">Old times acknowledged ‘ neath the threadbare blue !</l>
       <l n="77">Dropped at the corner of the embowered lane ,</l>
       <l n="78">Whistling I wade the knee-deep leaves again ,</l>
       <l n="79">While eager Argus , who has missed all day</l>
       <l n="80">The sharer of his condescending play ,</l>
       <l n="81">Comes leaping onward with a bark elate</l>
       <l n="82">And boisterous tail to greet me at the gate ;</l>
       <l n="83">That I was true in absence to our love</l>
       <l n="84">Let the thick dog'shYpppHeNears in my primer prove . ”</l>

     <p>I add only one further extract , which will possess a melancholy interest to all such as have endeavored to glean the materials of revolutionary history from the lips of aged persons , who took a part in the actual making of it , and , finding the manufacture profitable , continued the supply in an adequate proportion to the demand .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ Old Joe is gone , who saw hot Percy goad</l>
       <l n="2">His slow artillery up the Concord road ,</l>
       <l n="3">A tale which grew in wonder , year by year ,</l>
       <l n="4">As , every time he told it , Joe drew near</l>
       <l n="5">To the main fight , till , faded and grown gray ,</l>
       <l n="6">The original scene to bolder tints gave way ;</l>
       <l n="7">Then Joe had heard the foe 's scared double-quick</l>
       <l n="8">Beat on stove drum with one uncaptured stick ,</l>
       <l n="9">And , ere death came the lengthening tale to lop ,</l>
       <l n="10">Himself had fired , and seen a red-coat drop ;</l>
       <l n="11">Had Joe lived long enough , that scrambling fight</l>
       <l n="12">Had squared more nearly with his sense of right ,</l>
       <l n="13">And vanquished Percy , to complete the tale ,</l>
       <l n="14">Had hammered stone for life in Concord jail . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>I do not know that the foregoing extracts ought not to be called my own rather than Mr. Biglow 's , as , indeed , he maintained stoutly that my file had left nothing of his in them . I should not , perhaps , have felt entitled to take so great liberties with them , had I not more than suspected an hereditary vein of poetry in myself , a very near ancestor having written a Latin poem in the Harvard Gratulatio on the accession of George the Third . Suffice it to say , that , whether not satisfied with such limited approbation as I could conscientiously bestow , or from a sense of natural inaptitude , certain it is that my young friend could never be induced to any further essays in this kind . He affirmed that it was to him like writing in a foreign tongue ,— that Mr. Pope 's versification was like the regular ticking of one of Willard 's clocks , in which one could fancy , after long listening , a certain kind of rhythm or tune , but which yet was only a poverty-stricken tick , tick , after all ,— and that he had never seen a sweet-water on a trellis growing so fairly , or in forms so pleasing to his eye , as a fox-grape over a scrub-oak in a swamp . He added I know not what , to the effect that the sweet-water would only be the more disfigured by having its leaves starched and ironed out , and that Peg  sus ( so he called him ) hardly looked right with his mane and tail in curl-papers . These and other such opinions I did not long strive to eradicate , attributing them rather to a defective education and senses untuned by too long familiarity with purely natural objects , than to a perverted moral sense . I was the more inclined to this leniency since sufficient evidence was not to seek , that his verses , wanting as they certainly were in classic polish and point , had somehow taken hold of the public ear in a surprising manner . So , only setting him right as to the quantity of the proper name Pegasus , I left him to follow the bent of his natural genius .</p>
     <p>Yet could I not surrender him wholly to the tutelage of the pagan ( which , literally interpreted , signifies village ) muse without yet a further effort for his conversion , and to this end I resolved that whatever of poetic fire yet burned in myself , aided by the assiduous bellows of correct models , should be put in requisition . Accordingly , when my ingenious young parishioner brought to my study a copy of verses which he had written touching the acquisition of territory resulting from the Mexican war , and the folly of leaving the question of slavery or freedom to the adjudication of chance , I did myself indite a short fable or apologue after the manner of Gay and Prior , to the end that he might see how easily even such subjects as he treated of were capable of a more refined style and more elegant expression . Mr. Biglow 's production was as follows :—</p>

     </lg>
     <p>To turn now to other matters , there are two things upon which it would seem fitting to dilate somewhat more largely in this place ,— the Yankee character and the Yankee dialect . And , first , of the Yankee character , which has wanted neither open maligners , nor even more dangerous enemies in the persons of those unskilful painters who have given to it that hardness , angularity , and want of proper perspective , which , in truth , belonged , not to their subject , but to their own niggard and unskilful pencil .</p>
     <p>New England was not so much the colony of a mother country , as a Hagar driven forth into the wilderness . The little self-exiled band which came hither in 1620 came , not to seek gold , but to found a democracy . They came that they might have the privilege to work and pray , to sit upon hard benches and listen to painful preachers as long as they would , yea , even unto thirty-seventhly , if the spirit so willed it . And surely , if the Greek might boast his Thermopylae , where three hundred men fell in resisting the Persian , we may well be proud of our Plymouth Rock , where a handful of men , women , and children not merely faced , but vanquished , winter , famine , the wilderness , and the yet more invincible storge that drew them back to the green island far away . These found no lotus growing upon the surly shore , the taste of which could make them forget their little native Ithaca ; nor were they so wanting to themselves in faith as to burn their ship , but could see the fair west wind belly the homeward sail , and then turn unrepining to grapple with the terrible Unknown .</p>
     <p>As Want was the prime foe these hardy exodists had to fortress themselves against , so it is little wonder if that traditional feud is long in wearing out of the stock . The wounds of the old warfare were long ahealing , and an east wind of hard times puts a new ache in every one of them . Thrift was the first lesson in their hornbook , pointed out , letter after letter , by the lean finger of the hard schoolmaster , Necessity . Neither were those plump , rosy-gilled Englishmen that came hither , but a hard-faced , atrabilious , earnest-eyed race , stiff from long wrestling with the Lord in prayer , and who had taught Satan to dread the new Puritan hug . Add two hundred years ’ influence of soil , climate , and exposure , with its necessary result of idiosyncrasies , and we have the present Yankee , full of expedients , half-master of all trades , inventive in all but the beautiful , full of shifts , not yet capable of comfort , armed at all points against the old enemy Hunger , longanimous , good at patching , not so careful for what is best as for what will do , with a clasp to his purse and a button to his pocket , not skilled to build against Time , as in old countries , but against sore-pressing Need , accustomed to move the world with no pou sto but his own two feet , and no lever but his own long forecast . A strange hybrid , indeed , did circumstance beget , here in the New World , upon the old Puritan stock , and the earth never before saw such mystic-practicalism , such niggard-geniality , such calculating-fanaticism , such cast-iron-enthusiasm , such sourfaced-humor , such close-fisted-generosity . This new Graeculus esuriens will make a living out of anything . He will invent new trades as well as tools . His brain is his capital , and he will get education at all risks . Put him on Juan Fernandez , and he would make a spelling-book first , and a salt-pan afterward . In coelum , jusseris , ibit ,— or the other way either ,— it is all one , so anything is to be got by it . Yet , after all , thin , speculative Jonathan is more like the Englishman of two centuries ago than John Bull himself is . He has lost somewhat in solidity , has become fluent and adaptable , but more of the original groundwork of character remains . He feels more at home with Fulke Greville , Herbert of Cherbury , Quarles , George Herbert , and Browne , than with his modern English cousins . He is nearer than John , by at least a hundred years , to Naseby , Marston Moor , Worcester , and the time when , if ever , there were true Englishmen . John Bull has suffered the idea of the Invisible to be very much fattened out of him . Jonathan is conscious still that he lives in the world of the Unseen as well as of the Seen . To move John , you must make your fulcrum of solid beef and pudding ; an abstract idea will do for Jonathan .</p>

      <head>*. * TO THE INDULGENT READER .</head>
      <head>My friend , the Reverend Mr. Wilbur , having been seized with a dangerous fit of illness , before this Introduction had passed through the press , and being incapacitated for all literary exertion , sent to me his notes , memoranda , &amp; c ., and requested me to fashion them into some shape more fitting for the general eye . This , owing to the fragmentary and disjointed state of his manuscripts , I have felt wholly unable to do ; yet , being unwilling that the reader should be deprived of such parts of his lucubrations as seemed more finished , and not well discerning how to segregate these from the rest , I have concluded to send them all to the press precisely as they are .</head>

     <p>It remains to speak of the Yankee dialect . And , first , it may be premised , in a general way , that any one much read in the writings of the early colonists need not be told that the far greater share of the words and phrases now esteemed peculiar to New England , and local there , were brought from the mother country . A person familiar with the dialect of certain portions of Massachusetts will not fail to recognize , in ordinary discourse , many words now noted in English vocabularies as archaic , the greater part of which were in common use about the time of the King James translation of the Bible . Shakspeare stands less in need of a glossary to most New Englanders than to many a native of the Old Country . The peculiarities of our speech , however , are rapidly wearing out . As there is no country where reading is so universal and newspapers are so multitudinous , so no phrase remains long local , but is transplanted in the mail-bags to every remotest corner of the land . Consequently our dialect approaches nearer to uniformity than that of any other nation .</p>
     <p>The English have complained of us for coining new words . Many of those so stigmatized were old ones by them forgotten , and all make now an unquestioned part of the currency , wherever English is spoken . Undoubtedly , we have a right to make new words , as they are needed by the fresh aspects under which life presents itself here in the New World ; and , indeed , wherever a language is alive , it grows . It might be questioned whether we could not establish a stronger title to the ownership of the English tongue than the mother-islanders themselves . Here , past all question , is to be its great home and centre . And not only is it already spoken here by greater numbers , but with a higher popular average of correctness , than in Britain . The great writers of it , too , we might claim as ours , were ownership to be settled by the number of readers and lovers .</p>
     <p>As regards the provincialisms to be met with in this volume , I may say that the reader will not find one which is not ( as I believe ) either native or imported with the early settlers , nor one which I have not , with my own ears , heard in familiar use . In the metrical portion of the book , I have endeavored to adapt the spelling as nearly as possible to the ordinary mode of pronunciation . Let the reader who deems me over-particular remember this caution of Martial :—</p>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>1 . The genuine Yankee never gives the rough sound to the r when he can help it , and often displays considerable ingenuity in avoiding it even before a vowel .</p>
     <p>2 . He seldom sounds the final g , a piece of self-denial , if we consider his partiality for nasals . The same of the final d , as han ’ and stan ’ for hand and stand .</p>
     <p>3 . The h in such words as while , when , where , he omits altogether .</p>
     <p>4 . In regard to a , he shows some inconsistency , sometimes giving a close and obscure sound , as hev for have , hendy for handy , ez for as , thet for that , and again giving it the broad sound it has in father , as hansome for handsome .</p>
     <p>5 . To the sound ou he prefixes an e ( hard to exemplify otherwise than orally ) .</p>

       <l n="17">[ Mr. Wilbur 's notes here become entirely fragmentary .— C . N .]</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>alpha . Unable to procure a likeness of Mr. Biglow , I thought the curious reader might be gratified with a sight of the editorial effigies . And here a choice between two was offered ,— the one a profile ( entirely black ) cut by Doyle , the other a portrait painted by a native artist of much promise . The first of these seemed wanting in expression , and in the second a slight obliquity of the visual organs has been heightened ( perhaps from an over-desire of force on the part of the artist ) into too close an approach to actual strabismus . This slight divergence in my optical apparatus from the ordinary model — however I may have been taught to regard it in the light of a mercy rather than a cross , since it enabled me to give as much of directness and personal application to my discourses as met the wants of my congregation , without risk of offending any by being supposed to have him or her in my eye ( as the saying is ) — seemed yet to Mrs. Wilbur a sufficient objection to the engraving of the aforesaid painting . We read of many who either absolutely refused to allow the copying of their features , as especially did Plotinus and Agesilaus among the ancients , not to mention the more modern instances of Scioppius , Palaeottus , Pinellus , Velserus , Gataker , and others , or were indifferent thereto , as Cromwell .</p>
     <p>beta . Yet was Caesar desirous of concealing his baldness . Per contra , my Lord Protector 's carefulness in the matter of his wart might be cited . Men generally more desirous of being improved in their portraits than characters . Shall probably find very unflattered likenesses of ourselves in Recording Angel 's gallery .</p>
     <p>gamma . Whether any of our national peculiarities may be traced to our use of stoves , as a certain closeness of the lips in pronunciation , and a smothered smoulderingness of disposition , seldom roused to open flame ? An unrestrained intercourse with fire probably conducive to generosity and hospitality of soul . Ancient Mexicans used stoves , as the friar Augustin Ruiz reports , Hakluyt , III ., 468 ,— but the Popish priests not always reliable authority .</p>
     <p>To-day picked my Isabella grapes . Crop injured by attacks of rose-bug in the spring . Whether Noah was justifiable in preserving this class of insects ?</p>
     <p>delta . Concerning Mr. Biglow 's pedigree . Tolerably certain that there was never a poet among his ancestors . An ordination hymn attributed to a maternal uncle , but perhaps a sort of production not demanding the creative faculty .</p>
     <p>His grandfather a painter of the grandiose or Michael Angelo school . Seldom painted objects smaller than houses or barns , and these with uncommon expression .</p>
     <p>epsilon . Of the Wilburs no complete pedigree . The crest said to be a wild boar , whence , perhaps , the name . (? ) A connection with the Earls of Wilbraham ( quasi wild boar ham ) might be made out . This suggestion worth following up . In 1677 , John W. m. Expect ——, had issue , 1 . John , 2 . Haggai , 3 . Expect , 4 . Ruhamah , 5 . Desire .</p>

     <p>It is greatly to be lamented that this curious epitaph is mutilated . It is said that the sacrilegious British soldiers made a target of this stone during the war of Independence . How odious an animosity which pauses not at the grave ! How brutal that which spares not the monuments of authentic history ! This is not improbably from the pen of Rev . Moody Pyram , who is mentioned by Hubbard as having been noted for a silver vein of poetry . If his papers be still extant , a copy might possibly be recovered .</p>

     <p>| Mister Eddyter |:— Our Hosea wuz down to Boston last week , and he see a cruetin Sarjunt a struttin round as popler as a hen with 1 chicking , with 2 fellers a drummin and fifin arter him like all nater . the sarjunt he thout Hosea hed n't gut his i teeth cut cos he looked a kindo 's though he 'd jest com down , so he cal'lated to hook him in , but Hosy wood n't take none o ’ his sarse for all he hed much as 20 Rooster 's tales stuck onto his hat and eenamost enuf brass a bobbin up and down on his shoulders and figureed onto his coat and trousis , let alone wut nater hed sot in his featers , to make a 6 pounder out on .</p>
     <p>wal , Hosea he com home considerabal riled , and arter I 'd gone to bed I heern Him a thrashin round like a short-tailed Bull in fli-time . The old Woman ses she to me ses she , Zekle , ses she , our Hosee 's gut the chollery or suthin anuther ses she , do n't yon Bee skeered , ses I , he 's oney amakin pottery [ K ] ses i , he 's ollers on hand at that ere busynes like Da &amp; martin , and shure enuf , cum mornin , Hosy he cum down stares full chizzle , hare on eend and cote tales flyin , and sot rite of to go reed his varses to Parson Wilbur bein he haint aney grate shows o ’ book larnin himself , bimeby he cum back and sed the parson wuz dreffle tickled with ‘ em as i hoop you will Be , and said they wuz True grit .</p>
<note>Footnote K : Aut insanit , aut versos facit .— H . W .</note>     <note xml:id="noteK" place="bottom" n="K">Aut insanit , aut versos facit .— H . W .</note>
     <p>Hosea ses taint hardly fair to call ‘ em hisn now , cos the parson kind o ’ slicked off sum o ’ the last varses , but he told Hosee he did n't want to put his ore in to tetch to the Rest on ‘ em , bein they wuz verry well As thay wuz , and then Hosy ses he sed suthin a nuther about Simplex Mundishes or sum sech feller , but I guess Hosea kind o ’ did n't hear him , for I never hearn o ’ nobody o ’ that name in this villadge , and I 've lived here man and boy 76 year cum next tater diggin , and thair aint no wheres a kitting spryer'n I be .</p>
     <p>If you print ‘ em I wish you ‘ d jest let folks know who hosy 's father is , cos my ant Keziah used to say it 's nater to be curus ses she , she aint livin though and he 's a likely kind o ’ lad .</p>

     <note>The first recruiting sergeant on record I conceive to have been that individual who is mentioned in the Book of Job as going to and fro in the earth , and walking up and down in it . Bishop Latimer will have him to have been a bishop , but to me that other calling would appear more congenial . The sect of Cainites is not yet extinct , who esteemed the first-born of Adam to be the most worthy , not only because of that privilege of primogeniture , but inasmuch as he was able to overcome and slay his younger brother . That was a wise saying of the famous Marquis Pescara to the Papal Legate , that it was impossible for men to serve Mars and Christ at the same time . Yet in time past the profession of arms was judged to be kat exochen that of a gentleman , nor does this opinion want for strenuous upholders even in our day . Must we suppose , then , that the profession of Christianity was only intended for losels , or , at best , to afford an opening for plebeian ambition ? Or shall we hold with that nicely metaphysical Pomeranian , Captain Vratz , who was Count Koenigsmark 's chief instrument in the murder of Mr. Thynne , that the Scheme of Salvation has been arranged with an especial eye to the necessities of the upper classes , and that “ God would consider a gentleman and deal with him suitably to the condition and profession he had placed him in ” ? It may be said of us all , Exemplo plus quam ratione vivimus .— H . W .</note>

     <p>A LETTER</p>
     <p>FROM MR. HOSEA BIGLOW TO THE HON . J. T. BUCKINGHAM , EDITOR OF THE BOSTON COURIER , COVERING A LETTER FROM MR. B. SAWIN , PRIVATE IN THE MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT .</p>
     <note>This letter of Mr. Sawin 's was not originally written in verse . Mr. Biglow , thinking it peculiarly susceptible of metrical adornment , translated it , so to speak , into his own vernacular tongue . This is not the time to consider the question , whether rhyme be a mode of expression natural to the human race . If leisure from other and more important avocations be granted , I will handle the matter more at large in an appendix to the present volume . In this place I will barely remark , that I have sometimes noticed in the unlanguaged prattlings of infants a fondness for alliteration , assonance , and even rhyme , in which natural predisposition we may trace the three degrees through which our Anglo-Saxon verse rose to its culmination in the poetry of Pope . I would not be understood as questioning in these remarks that pious theory which supposes that children , if left entirely to themselves , would naturally discourse in Hebrew . For this the authority of one experiment is claimed , and I could , with Sir Thomas Browne , desire its establishment , inasmuch as the acquirement of that sacred tongue would thereby be facilitated . I am aware that Herodotus states the conclusion of Psammeticus to have been in favor of a dialect of the Phrygian . But , beside the chance that a trial of this importance would hardly be blessed to a Pagan monarch whose only motive was curiosity , we have on the Hebrew side the comparatively recent investigation of James the Fourth of Scotland . I will add to this prefatory remark , that Mr. Sawin , though a native of Jaalam , has never been a stated attendant on the religious exercises of my congregation . I consider my humble efforts prospered in that not one of my sheep hath ever indued the wolf 's clothing of war , save for the comparatively innocent diversion of a militia training . Not that my flock are backward to undergo the hardships of defensive warfare . They serve cheerfully in the great army which fights even unto death pro aris et focis , accoutred with the spade , the axe , the plane , the sledge , the spelling-book , and other such effectual weapons against want and ignorance and unthrift . I have taught them ( under God ) to esteem our human institutions as but tents of a night , to be stricken whenever Truth puts the bugle to her lips and sounds a march to the heights of wider-viewed intelligence and more perfect organization .— H .

     <p>[ Those have not been wanting ( as , indeed , when hath Satan been to seek for attorneys ? ) who have maintained that our late inroad upon Mexico was undertaken , not so much for the avenging of any national quarrel , as for the spreading of free institutions and of Protestantism . Capita vix duabus Anticyris medenda ! Verily I admire that no pious sergeant among these new Crusaders beheld Martin Luther riding at the front of the host upon a tamed pontifical bull , as , in that former invasion of Mexico , the zealous Gomara ( spawn though he were of the Scarlet Woman ) was favored with a vision of St. James of Compostella , skewering the infidels upon his apostolical lance . We read , also , that Richard of the lion heart , having gone to Palestine on a similar errand of mercy , was divinely encouraged to cut the throats of such Paynims as refused to swallow the bread of life ( doubtless that they might be thereafter incapacitated for swallowing the filthy gobbets of Mahound ) by angels of heaven , who cried to the king and his knights ,— Seigneurs , tuez ! tuez ! providentially using the French tongue , as being the only one understood by their auditors . This would argue for the pantoglottism of these celestial intelligences , while , on the other hand , the Devil , teste Cotton Mather , is unversed in certain of the Indian dialects . Yet must he be a semeiologist the most expert , making himself intelligible to every people and kindred by signs ; no other discourse , indeed , being needful , than such as the mackerel-fisher holds with his finned quarry , who , if other bait be wanting , can by a bare bit of white rag at the end of a string captivate those foolish fishes . Such piscatorial oratory is Satan cunning in . Before one he trails a hat and feather , or a bare feather without a hat ; before another , a Presidential chair , or a tidewaiter 's stool , or a pulpit in the city , no matter what . To us , dangling there over our heads , they seem junkets dropped out of the seventh heaven , sops dipped in nectar , but , once in our mouths , they are all one , bits of fuzzy cotton .</p>
     <p>This , however , by the way . It is time now revocare gradum . While so many miracles of this sort , vouched by eyewitnesses , have encouraged the arms of Papists , not to speak of Echetlaeus at Marathon and those Dioscuri ( whom we must conclude imps of the pit ) who sundry times captained the pagan Roman soldiery , it is strange that our first American crusade was not in some such wise also signalized . Yet it is said that the Lord hath manifestly prospered our armies . This opens the question , whether , when our hands are strengthened to make great slaughter of our enemies , it be absolutely and demonstratively certain that this might is added to us from above , or whether some Potentate from an opposite quarter may not have a finger in it , as there are few pies into which his meddling digits are not thrust . Would the Sanctifier and Setter-apart of the seventh day have assisted in a victory gained on the Sabbath , as was one in the late war ? Or has that day become less an object of his especial care since the year 1697 , when so manifest a providence occurred to Mr. William Trowbridge , in answer to whose prayers , when he and all on shipboard with him were starving , a dolphin was sent daily , “ which was enough to serve ‘ em ; only on Saturdays they still catched a couple , and on the Lord 's Days they could catch none at all ” ? Haply they might have been permitted , by way of mortification , to take some few sculpins ( those banes of the salt-water angler ) , which unseemly fish would , moreover , have conveyed to them a symbolical reproof for their breach of the day , being known in the rude dialect of our mariners as Cape Cod Clergymen .</p>
     <p>It has been a refreshment to many nice consciences to know that our Chief Magistrate would not regard with eyes of approval the ( by many esteemed ) sinful pastime of dancing , and I own myself to be so far of that mind , that I could not but set my face against this Mexican Polka , though danced to the Presidential piping with a Gubernatorial second . If ever the country should be seized with another such mania de propaganda fide , I think it would be wise to fill our bombshells with alternate copies of the Cambridge Platform and the Thirty-nine Articles , which would produce a mixture of the highest explosive power , and to wrap every one of our cannon-balls in a leaf of the New Testament , the reading of which is denied to those who sit in the darkness of Popery . Those iron evangelists would thus be able to disseminate vital religion and Gospel truth in quarters inaccessible to the ordinary missionary . I have seen lads , unimpregnate with the more sublimated punctiliousness of Walton , secure pickerel , taking their unwary siesta beneath the lily-pads too nigh the surface , with a gun and small shot . Why not , then , since gunpowder was unknown in the time of the Apostles ( not to enter here upon the question whether it were discovered before that period by the Chinese ) , suit our metaphor to the age in which we live , and say shooters as well as fishers of men ?</p>
     <p>I do much fear that we shall be seized now and then with a Protestant fervor , as long as we have neighbor Naboths whose wallowings in Papistical mire excite our horror in exact proportion to the size and desirableness of their vineyards . Yet I rejoice that some earnest Protestants have been made by this war ,— I mean those who protested against it . Fewer they were than I could wish , for one might imagine America to have been colonized by a tribe of those nondescript African animals the Aye-Ayes , so difficult a word is No to us all . There is some malformation or defect of the vocal organs , which either prevents our uttering it at all , or gives it so thick a pronunciation as to be unintelligible . A mouth filled with the national pudding , or watering in expectation thereof , is wholly incompetent to this refractory monosyllable . An abject and herpetic Public Opinion is the Pope , the Anti-Christ , for us to protest against e corde cordium . And by what College of Cardinals is this our God'shYpppHeNvicar , our binder and looser , elected ? Very like , by the sacred conclave of Tag , Rag , and Bobtail , in the gracious atmosphere of the grog-shop . Yet it is of this that we must all be puppets . This thumps the pulpit-cushion , this guides the editor 's pen , this wags the senator 's tongue . This decides what Scriptures are canonical , and shuffles Christ away into the Apocrypha . According to that sentence fathered upon Solon , Houto demosion kakon erchetai oikad ’ hekasto . This unclean spirit is skilful to assume various shapes . I have known it to enter my own study and nudge my elbow of a Saturday , under the semblance of a wealthy member of my congregation . It were a great blessing , if every particular of what in the sum we call popular sentiment could carry about the name of its manufacturer stamped legibly upon it . I gave a stab under the fifth rib to that pestilent fallacy ,— “ Our country , right or wrong , ” — by tracing its original to a speech of Ensign Cilley at a dinner of the Bungtown Fencibles . H. W .]</p>

     <p>WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS .</p>
     <p>[ A few remarks on the following verses will not be out of place . The satire in them was not meant to have any personal , but only a general , application . Of the gentleman upon whose letter they were intended as a commentary Mr. Biglow had never heard , till he saw the letter itself . The position of the satirist is oftentimes one which he would not have chosen , had the election been left to himself . In attacking bad principles , he is obliged to select some individual who has made himself their exponent , and in whom they are impersonate , to the end that what he says may not , through ambiguity , be dissipated tenues in auras . For what says Seneca ? Longum iter per praecepta , breve et efficace per exempla . A bad principle is comparatively harmless while it continues to be an abstraction , nor can the general mind comprehend it fully till it is printed in that large type which all men can read at sight , namely , the life and character , the sayings and doings , of particular persons . It is one of the cunningest fetches of Satan , that he never exposes himself directly to our arrows , but , still dodging behind this neighbor or that acquaintance , compels us to wound him through them , if at all . He holds our affections as hostages , the while he patches up a truce with our conscience .</p>
     <p>Meanwhile , let us not forget that the aim of the true satirist is not to be severe upon persons , but only upon falsehood , and , as Truth and Falsehood start from the same point , and sometimes even go along together for a little way , his business is to follow the path of the latter after it diverges , and to show her floundering in the bog at the end of it . Truth is quite beyond the reach of satire . There is so brave a simplicity in her , that she can no more be made ridiculous than an oak or a pine . The danger of the satirist is , that continual use may deaden his sensibility to the force of language . He becomes more and more liable to strike harder than he knows or intends . He may be careful to put on his boxing-gloves , and yet forget , that , the older they grow , the more plainly may the knuckles inside be felt . Moreover , in the heat of contest , the eye is insensibly drawn to the crown of victory , whose tawdry tinsel glitters through that dust of the ring which obscures Truth 's wreath of simple leaves . I have sometimes thought that my young friend , Mr. Biglow , needed a monitory hand laid on his arm ,— aliquid sufflaminandus erat . I have never thought it good husbandry to water the tender plants of reform with aqua fortis , yet , where so much is to do in the beds , he were a sorry gardener who should wage a whole day 's war with an iron scuffle on those ill weeds that make the garden-walks of life unsightly , when a sprinkle of Attic salt will wither them up . Est ars etiam maledicendi , says Scaliger , and truly it is a hard thing to say where the graceful gentleness of the lamb merges in downright sheepishness . We may conclude with worthy and wise Dr. Fuller , that “ one may be a lamb in private wrongs , but in hearing general affronts to goodness they are asses which are not lions . ” — H. W .]</p>

     <p>[ The attentive reader will doubtless have perceived in the foregoing poem an allusion to that pernicious sentiment ,— “ Our country , right or wrong . ” It is an abuse of language to call a certain portion of land , much more , certain personages , elevated for the time being to high station , our country . I would not sever nor loosen a single one of those ties by which we are united to the spot of our birth , nor minish by a tittle the respect due to the Magistrate . I love our own Bay State too well to do the one , and as for the other , I have myself for nigh forty years exercised , however unworthily , the function of Justice of the Peace , having been called thereto by the unsolicited kindness of that most excellent man and upright patriot , Caleb Strong . Patriae fumus igne alieno luculentior is best qualified with this ,— Ubi libertas , ibi patria . We are inhabitants of two worlds , and owe a double but not a divided , allegiance . In virtue of our clay , this little ball of earth exacts a certain loyalty of us , while , in our capacity as spirits , we are admitted citizens of an invisible and holier fatherland . There is a patriotism of the soul whose claim absolves us from our other and terrene fealty . Our true country is that ideal realm which we represent to ourselves under the names of religion , duty , and the like . Our terrestrial organizations are but far-off approaches to so fair a model , and all they are verily traitors who resist not any attempt to divert them from this their original intendment . When , therefore , one would have us to fling up our caps and shout with the multitude ,— “ Our country , however bounded ! ” he demands of us that we sacrifice the larger to the less , the higher to the lower , and that we yield to the imaginary claims of a few acres of soil our duty and privilege as liegemen of Truth . Our true country is bounded on the north and the south , on the east and the west , by Justice , and when she oversteps that invisible boundary-line by so much as a hair'shYpppHeNbreadth , she ceases to be our mother , and chooses rather to be looked upon quasi noverca . That is a hard choice , when our earthly love of country calls upon us to tread one path and our duty points us to another . We must make as noble and becoming an election as did Penelope between Icarius and Ulysses . Veiling our faces , we must take silently the hand of Duty to follow her .</p>
     <p>Shortly after the publication of the foregoing poem , there appeared some comments upon it in one of the public prints which seemed to call for animadversion . I accordingly addressed to Mr. Buckingham , of the Boston Courier , the following letter .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">| Jaalam |, November 4 , 1847 .</l>
       <l n="2">‘ To the Editor of the Courier :</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ | Respected Sir |,— Calling at the post-office this morning , our worthy and efficient postmaster offered for my perusal a paragraph in the Boston Morning Post of the 3d instant , wherein certain effusions of the pastoral muse are attributed to the pen of Mr. James Russell Lowell . For aught I know or can affirm to the contrary , this Mr. Lowell may be a very deserving person and a youth of parts ( though I have seen verses of his which I could never rightly understand ) ; and if he be such , he , I am certain , as well as I , would be free from any proclivity to appropriate to himself whatever of credit ( or discredit ) may honestly belong to another . I am confident , that , in penning these few lines , I am only forestalling a disclaimer from that young gentleman , whose silence hitherto , when rumor pointed to himward , has excited in my bosom mingled emotions of sorrow and surprise . Well may my young parishioner , Mr. Biglow , exclaim with the poet ,</p>
     <p>‘ Sic vos non vobis , ’ &amp; c .;</p>
     <p>though , in saying this , I would not convey the impression that he is a proficient in the Latin tongue ,— the tongue , I might add , of a Horace and a Tully .</p>
     <p>“ Mr. B. does not employ his pen , I can safely say , for any lucre of worldly gain , or to be exalted by the carnal plaudits of men digito monstrari , &amp; c. He does not wait upon Providence for mercies , and in his heart mean merces . But I should esteem myself as verily deficient in my duty ( who am his friend and in some unworthy sort his spiritual fidus Achates , &amp; c .) , if I did not step forward to claim for him whatever measure of applause might be assigned to him by the judicious .</p>
     <p>“ If this were a fitting occasion , I might venture here a brief dissertation touching the manner and kind of my young friend 's poetry . But I dubitate whether this abstruser sort of speculation ( though enlivened by some apposite instances from Aristophanes ) would sufficiently interest your oppidan readers . As regards their satirical tone , and their plainness of speech , I will only say , that , in my pastoral experience , I have found that the Arch-Enemy loves nothing better than to be treated as a religious , moral , and intellectual being , and that there is no apage Sathanas ! so potent as ridicule . But it is a kind of weapon that must have a button of good-nature on the point of it .</p>
     <p>“ The productions of Mr. B. have been stigmatized in some quarters as unpatriotic ; but I can vouch that he loves his native soil with that hearty , though discriminating , attachment which springs from an intimate social intercourse of many years ’ standing . In the ploughing season , no one has a deeper share in the well-being of the country than he . If Dean Swift were right in saying that he who makes two blades of grass grow where one grew before confers a greater benefit on the state than he who taketh a city , Mr. B. might exhibit a fairer claim to the Presidency than General Scott himself . I think that some of those disinterested lovers of the hard-handed democracy , whose fingers have never touched anything rougher than the dollars of our common country , would hesitate to compare palms with him . It would do your heart good , respected Sir , to see that young man mow . He cuts a cleaner and wider swarth than any in this town .</p>
     <p>“ But it is time for me to be at my Post . It is very clear that my young friend 's shot has struck the lintel , for the Post is shaken ( Amos ix . 1 ) . The editor of that paper is a strenuous advocate of the Mexican war , and a colonel , as I am given to understand . I presume , that , being necessarily absent in Mexico , he has left his journal in some less judicious hands . At any rate , the Post has been too swift on this occasion . It could hardly have cited a more incontrovertible line from any poem than that which it has selected for animadversion , namely ,—</p>
     <p>‘ We kind o ’ thought Christ went agin war an ’ pillage . ’</p>
     <p>“ If the Post maintains the converse of this proposition , it can hardly be considered as a safe guide-post for the moral and religious portions of its party , however many other excellent qualities of a post it may be blessed with . There is a sign in London on which is painted ,— ‘ The Green Man . ’ It would do very well as a portrait of any individual who would support so unscriptural a thesis . As regards the language of the line in question , I am bold to say that He who readeth the hearts of men will not account any dialect unseemly which conveys a sound and pious sentiment . I could wish that such sentiments were more common , however uncouthly expressed . Saint Ambrose affirms , that veritas a quocunque ( why not , then , quomodocunque ? ) dicatur , a spiritu sancto est . Digest also this of Baxter :— ‘ The plainest words are the most profitable oratory in the weightiest matters . ’</p>
     <p>“ When the paragraph in question was shown to Mr. Biglow , the only part of it which seemed to give him any dissatisfaction was that which classed him with the Whig party . He says , that , if resolutions are a nourishing kind of diet , that party must be in a very hearty and flourishing condition ; for that they have quietly eaten more good ones of their own baking than he could have conceived to be possible without repletion . He has been for some years past ( I regret to say ) an ardent opponent of those sound doctrines of protective policy which form so prominent a portion of the creed of that party . I confess , that , in some discussions which I have had with him on this point in my study , he has displayed a vein of obstinacy which I had not hitherto detected in his composition . He is also ( horresco referens ) infected in no small measure with the peculiar notions of a print called the Liberator , whose heresies I take every proper opportunity of combating , and of which , I thank God , I have never read a single line .</p>
     <p>“ I did not see Mr . B . ' s verses until they appeared in print , and there is certainly one thing in them which I consider highly improper . I allude to the personal references to myself by name . To confer notoriety on an humble individual who is laboring quietly in his vocation , and who keeps his cloth as free as he can from the dust of the political arena ( though vae mihi si non evangelizavero ) , is no doubt an indecorum . The sentiments which he attributes to me I will not deny to be mine . They were embodied , though in a different form , in a discourse preached upon the last day of public fasting , and were acceptable to my entire people ( of whatever political views ) , except the postmaster , who dissented ex officio . I observe that you sometimes devote a portion of your paper to a religious summary . I should be well pleased to furnish a copy of my discourse for insertion in this department of your instructive journal . By omitting the advertisements , it might easily be got within the limits of a single number , and I venture to insure you the sale of some scores of copies in this town . I will cheerfully render myself responsible for ten . It might possibly be advantageous to issue it as an extra . But perhaps you will not esteem it an object , and I will not press it . My offer does not spring from any weak desire of seeing my name in print ; for I can enjoy this satisfaction at any time by turning to the Triennial Catalogue of the University , where it also possesses that added emphasis of Italics with which those of my calling are distinguished .</p>
     <p>“ I would simply add , that I continue to fit ingenuous youth for college , and that I have two spacious and airy sleeping apartments at this moment unoccupied . Ingenuas didicisse , &amp; c. Terms , which vary according to the circumstances of the parents , may be known on application to me by letter , post paid . In all cases the lad will be expected to fetch his own towels . This rule , Mrs. W. desires me to add , has no exceptions .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ Respectfully , your obedient servant ,</l>
       <l n="2">“ | Homer Wilbur |, A. M .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ P. S . Perhaps the last paragraph may look like an attempt to obtain the insertion of my circular gratuitously . If it should appear to you in that light , I desire that you would erase it , or charge for it at the usual rates , and deduct the amount from the proceeds in your hands from the sale of my discourse , when it shall be printed . My circular is much longer and more explicit , and will be forwarded without charge to any who may desire it . It has been very neatly executed on a letter sheet , by a very deserving printer , who attends upon my ministry , and is a creditable specimen of the typographic art . I have one hung over my mantelpiece in a neat frame , where it makes a beautiful and appropriate ornament , and balances the profile of Mrs. W ., cut with her toes by the young lady born without arms . H. W . ”</p>
     <p>I have in the foregoing letter mentioned General Scott in connection with the Presidency , because I have been given to understand that he has blown to pieces and otherwise caused to be destroyed more Mexicans than any other commander . His claim would therefore be deservedly considered the strongest . Until accurate returns of the Mexicans killed , wounded , and maimed be obtained , it will be difficult to settle these nice points of precedence . Should it prove that any other officer has been more meritorious and destructive than General S ., and has thereby rendered himself more worthy of the confidence and support of the conservative portion of our community , I shall cheerfully insert his name , instead of that of General S ., in a future edition . It may be thought , likewise , that General S. has invalidated his claims by too much attention to the decencies of apparel , and the habits belonging to a gentleman . These abstruser points of statesmanship are beyond my scope . I wonder not that successful military achievement should attract the admiration of the multitude . Rather do I rejoice with wonder to behold how rapidly this sentiment is losing its hold upon the popular mind . It is related of Thomas Warton , the second of that honored name who held the office of Poetry Professor at Oxford , that , when one wished to find him , being absconded , as was his wont , in some obscure alehouse , he was counselled to traverse the city with a drum and fife , the sound of which inspiring music would be sure to draw the Doctor from his retirement into the street . We are all more or less bitten with this martial insanity . Nescio qua dulcedine ... cunctos ducit . I confess to some infection of that itch myself . When I see a Brigadier-General maintaining his insecure elevation in the saddle under the severe fire of the training-field , and when I remember that some military enthusiasts , through haste , inexperience , or an over-desire to lend reality to those fictitious combats , will sometimes discharge their ramrods , I cannot but admire , while I deplore , the mistaken devotion of those heroic officers . Semel insanivimus omnes . I was myself , during the late war with Great Britain , chaplain of a regiment , which was fortunately never called to active military duty . I mention this circumstance with regret rather than pride . Had I been summoned to actual warfare , I trust that I might have been strengthened to bear myself after the manner of that reverend father in our New England Israel , Dr. Benjamin Colman , who , as we are told in Turell 's life of him , when the vessel in which he had taken passage for England was attacked by a French privateer , “ fought like a philosopher and a Christian ,... and prayed all the while he charged and fired . ” As this note is already long , I shall not here enter upon a discussion of the question , whether Christians may lawfully be soldiers . I think it sufficiently evident , that , during the first two centuries of the Christian era , at least , two professions were esteemed incompatible . Consult Jortin on this head .— H . W .]</p>

     <p>REMARKS OF INCREASE D. O'PHACE , ESQUIRE , AT AN EXTRUMPERY CAUCUS IN STATE STREET , REPORTED BY MR. H. BIGLOW .</p>
     <p>[ The ingenious reader will at once understand that no such speech as the following was ever totidem verbis pronounced . But there are simpler and less guarded wits , for the satisfying of which such an explanation may be needful . For there are certain invisible lines , which as Truth successively overpasses , she becomes Untruth to one and another of us , as a large river , flowing from one kingdom into another , sometimes takes a new name , albeit the waters undergo no change , how small soever . There is , moreover , a truth of fiction more veracious than the truth of fact , as that of the Poet , which represents to us things and events as they ought to be , rather than servilely copies them as they are imperfectly imaged in the crooked and smoky glass of our mundane affairs . It is this which makes the speech of Antonius , though originally spoken in no wider a forum than the brain of Shakspeare , more historically valuable than that other which Appian has reported , by as much as the understanding of the Englishman was more comprehensive than that of the Alexandrian . Mr. Biglow , in the present instance , has only made use of a license assumed by all the historians of antiquity , who put into the mouths of various characters such words as seem to them most fitting to the occasion and to the speaker . If it be objected that no such oration could ever have been delivered , I answer , that there are few assemblages for speech-making which do not better deserve the title of Parliamentum Indoctorum than did the sixth Parliament of Henry the Fourth , and that men still continue to have as much faith in the Oracle of Fools as ever Pantagruel had . Howell , in his letters , recounts a merry tale of a certain ambassador of Queen Elizabeth , who , having written two letters , one to her Majesty and the other to his wife , directed them at cross-purposes , so that the Queen was beducked and bedeared and requested to send a change of hose , and the wife was beprincessed and otherwise unwontedly besuperlatived , till the one feared for the wits of her ambassador , and the other for those of her husband . In like manner it may be presumed that our speaker has misdirected some of his thoughts , and given to the whole theatre what he would have wished to confide only to a select auditory at the back of the curtain . For it is seldom that we can get any frank utterance from men , who address , for the most part , a Buncombe either in this world or the next . As for their audiences , it may be truly said of our people , that they enjoy one political institution in common with the ancient Athenians : I mean a certain profitless kind of ostracism , wherewith , nevertheless , they seem hitherto well enough content . For in Presidential elections , and other affairs of the sort , whereas I observe that the oysters fall to the lot of comparatively few , the shells ( such as the privileges of voting as they are told to do by the ostrivori aforesaid , and of huzzaing at public meetings ) are very liberally distributed among the people , as being their prescriptive and quite sufficient portion .</p>
     <p>The occasion of the speech is supposed to be Mr. Palfrey 's refusal to vote for the Whig candidate for the Speakership .— H . W .]</p>

     <p>[ Into the question , whether the ability to express ourselves in articulate language has been productive of more good or evil , I shall not here enter at large . The two faculties of speech and of speech-making are wholly diverse in their natures . By the first we make ourselves intelligible , by the last unintelligible , to our fellows . It has not seldom occurred to me ( noting how in our national legislature every thing runs to talk , as lettuces , if the season or the soil be unpropitious , shoot up lankly to seed , instead of forming handsome heads ) that Babel was the first Congress , the earliest mill erected for the manufacture of gabble . In these days , what with Town Meetings , School Committees , Boards ( lumber ) of one kind and another , Congresses , Parliaments , Diets , Indian Councils , Palavers , and the like , there is scarce a village which has not its factories of this description driven by ( milk-and - ) water power . I cannot conceive the confusion of tongues to have been the curse of Babel , since I esteem my ignorance of other languages as a kind of Martello-tower , in which I am safe from the furious bombardments of foreign garrulity . For this reason I have ever preferred the study of the dead languages , those primitive formations being Ararats upon whose silent peaks I sit secure and watch this new deluge without fear , though it rain figures ( simulacra , semblances ) of speech forty days and nights together , as it not uncommonly happens . Thus is my coat , as it were , without buttons by which any but a vernacular wild bore can seize me . Is it not possible that the Shakers may intend to convey a quiet reproof and hint , in fastening their outer garments with hooks and eyes ?</p>
     <p>This reflection concerning Babel , which I find in no Commentary , was first thrown upon my mind when an excellent deacon of my congregation ( being infected with the Second Advent delusion ) assured me that he had received a first instalment of the gift of tongues as a small earnest of larger possessions in the like kind to follow . For , of a truth , I could not reconcile it with my ideas of the Divine justice and mercy that the single wall which protected people , of other languages from the incursions of this otherwise well-meaning propagandist should be broken down .</p>
     <p>In reading Congressional debates , I have fancied , that , after the subsidence of those painful buzzings in the brain which result from such exercises , I detected a slender residuum of valuable information . I made the discovery that nothing takes longer in the saying than any thing else , for , as ex nihilo nihil fit , so from one polypus nothing any number of similar ones may be produced . I would recommend to the attention of viva voce debaters and controversialists the admirable example of the monk Copres , who , in the fourth century , stood for half an hour in the midst of a great fire , and thereby silenced a Manichaean antagonist who had less of the salamander in him . As for those who quarrel in print , I have no concern with them here , since the eyelids are a divinely-granted shield against all such . Moreover , I have observed in many modern books that the printed portion is becoming gradually smaller , and the number of blank or fly-leaves ( as they are called ) greater . Should this fortunate tendency of literature continue , books will grow more valuable from year to year , and the whole Serbonian bog yield to the advances of firm arable land .</p>
     <p>The sagacious Lacedaemonians hearing that Tesephone had bragged that he could talk all day long on any given subject , made no more ado , but forthwith banished him , whereby they supplied him a topic and at the same time took care that his experiment upon it should be tried out of ear-shot .</p>
     <p>I have wondered , in the Representatives ’ Chamber of our own Commonwealth , to mark how little impression seemed to be produced by that emblematic fish suspended over the heads of the members . Our wiser ancestors , no doubt , hung it there as being the animal which the Pythagoreans reverenced for its silence , and which certainly in that particular does not so well merit the epithet cold-blooded , by which naturalists distinguish it , as certain bipeds , afflicted with ditch-water on the brain , who take occasion to tap themselves in Fanueil Halls , meeting-houses , and other places of public resort .— H .

     <p>THE DEBATE IN THE SENNIT .</p>
     <p>SOT TO A NUSRY RHYME .</p>
     <p>[ The incident which gave rise to the debate satirized in the following verses was the unsuccessful attempt of Drayton and Sayres to give freedom to seventy men and women , fellow-beings and fellow-Christians . Had Tripoli , instead of Washington , been the scene of this undertaking , the unhappy leaders in it would have been as secure of the theoretic as they now are of the practical part of martyrdom . I question whether the Dey of Tripoli is blessed with a District Attorney so benighted as ours at the seat of government . Very fitly is he named Key , who would allow himself to be made the instrument of locking the door of hope against sufferers in such a cause . Not all the waters of the ocean can cleanse the vile smutch of the jailer 's fingers from off that little Key . Ahenea clavis , a brazen Key indeed !</p>
     <p>Mr. Calhoun , who is made the chief speaker in this burlesque , seems to think that the light of the nineteenth century is to be put out as soon as he tinkles his little cow-bell curfew . Whenever slavery is touched , he sets up his scarecrow of dissolving the Union . This may do for the North , but I should conjecture that something more than a pumpkin-lantern is required to scare manifest and irretrievable Destiny out of her path . Mr. Calhoun cannot let go the apron-string of the Past . The Past is a good nurse , but we must be weaned from her sooner or later , even though , like Plotinus , we should run home from school to ask the breast , after we are tolerably well-grown youths . It will not do for us to hide our faces in her lap , whenever the strange Future holds out her arms and asks us to come to her .</p>
     <p>But we are all alike . We have all heard it said , often enough , that little boys must not play with fire ; and yet , if the matches be taken away from us and put out of reach upon the shelf , we must needs get into our little corner , and scowl and stamp and threaten the dire revenge of going to bed without our supper . The world shall stop till we get our dangerous plaything again . Dame Earth , meanwhile , who has more than enough household matters to mind , goes bustling hither and thither as a hiss or a sputter tells her that this or that kettle of hers is boiling over and before bedtime we are glad to eat our porridge cold , and gulp down our dignity along with it .</p>
     <p>Mr. Calhoun has somehow acquired the name of a great statesman , and , if it be great statesmanship to put lance in rest and run a tilt at the Spirit of the Age with the certainty of being next moment hurled neck and heels into the dust amid universal laughter , he deserves the title . He is the Sir Kay of our modern chivalry . He should remember the old Scandinavian mythus . Thor was the strongest of gods , but he could not wrestle with Time , nor so much as lift up a fold of the great snake which knit the universe together ; and when he smote the Earth , though with his terrible mallet , it was but as if a leaf had fallen . Yet all the while it seemed to Thor that he had only been wrestling with an old woman , striving to lift a cat , and striking a stupid giant on the head .</p>
     <p>And in old times , doubtless , the giants were stupid , and there was no better sport for the Sir Launcelots and Sir Gawains than to go about cutting off their great blundering heads with enchanted swords . But things have wonderfully changed . It is the giants , now-a-days , that have the science and the intelligence , while the chivalrous Don Quixotes of Conservatism still cumber themselves with the clumsy armor of a by-gone age . On whirls the restless globe through unsounded time , with its cities and its silences , its births and funerals , half light , half shade , but never wholly dark , and sure to swing round into the happy morning at last . With an involuntary smile , one sees Mr. Calhoun letting slip his pack-thread cable with a crooked pin at the end of it to anchor South Carolina upon the bank and shoal of the Past .— H . W .]</p>

     <p>[ It was said of old time , that riches have wings ; and , though this be not applicable in a literal strictness to the wealth of our patriarchal brethren of the South , yet it is clear that their possessions have legs , and an unaccountable propensity for using them in a northerly direction . I marvel that the grand jury of Washington did not find a true bill against the North Star for aiding and abetting Drayton and Sayres . It would have been quite of a piece with the intelligence displayed by the South on other questions connected with slavery . I think that no ship of state was ever freighted with a more veritable Jonah than this same domestic institution of ours . Mephistopheles himself could not feign so bitterly , so satirically sad a sight as this of three millions of human beings crushed beyond help or hope by this one mighty argument ,— Our fathers knew no better ! Nevertheless , it is the unavoidable destiny of Jonahs to be cast overboard sooner or later . Or shall we try the experiment of hiding our Jonah in a safe place , that none may lay hands on him to make jetsam of him ? Let us , then , with equal forethought and wisdom , lash ourselves to the anchor , and await , in pious confidence , the certain result . Perhaps our suspicious passenger is no Jonah after all , being black . For it is well known that a superintending Providence made a kind of sandwich of Ham and his descendants , to be devoured by the Caucasian race .</p>
     <p>In God 's name , let all , who hear nearer and nearer the hungry moan of the storm and the growl of the breakers , speak out ! But , alas ! we have no right to interfere . If a man pluck an apple of mine , he shall be in danger of the justice ; but if he steal my brother , I must be silent . Who says this ? Our Constitution , consecrated by the callous consuetude of sixty years , and grasped in triumphant argument by the left hand of him whose right hand clutches the clotted slave-whip . Justice , venerable with the undethronable majesty of countless aeons , says ,—| Speak |! The Past , wise with the sorrows and desolations of ages , from amid her shattered fanes and wolf-housing palaces , echoes ,—| Speak |! Nature , through her thousand trumpets of freedom , her stars , her sunrises , her seas , her winds , her cataracts , her mountains blue with cloudy pines , blows jubilant encouragement , and cries ,—| Speak !| From the soul 's trembling abysses the still , small voice not vaguely murmurs ,—| Speak |! But , alas ! the Constitution and the Honorable Mr. Bagowind , M. C ., say ,—| Be dumb |!</p>
     <p>It occurs to me to suggest , as a topic of inquiry in this connection , whether , on that momentous occasion when the goats and the sheep shall be parted , the Constitution and the Honorable Mr. Bagowind , M. C ., will be expected to take their places on the left as our hircine vicars .</p>
     <p>Quid sum miser tunc dicturus ? Quem patronum rogaturus ?</p>
     <p>There is a point where toleration sinks into sheer baseness and poltroonery . The toleration of the worst leads us to look on what is barely better as good enough , and to worship what is only moderately good . Woe to that man , or that nation , to whom mediocrity has become an ideal !</p>
     <p>Has our experiment of self-government succeeded , if it barely manage to rub and go ? Here , now , is a piece of barbarism which Christ and the nineteenth century say shall cease , and which Messrs. Smith , Brown , and others say shall not cease . I would by no means deny the eminent respectability of these gentlemen , but I confess , that , in such a wrestling-match , I cannot help having my fears for them .</p>

     <p>No . VI .</p>
     <p>THE PIOUS EDITOR 'S CREED .</p>
     <p>[ At the special instance of Mr. Biglow , I preface the following satire with an extract from a sermon preached during the past summer , from Ezekiel xxxiv . 2 :— “ Son of man , prophesy against the shepherds of Israel . ” Since the Sabbath on which this discourse was delivered , the editor of the “ Jaalam Independent Blunderbuss ” has unaccountably absented himself from our house of worship .</p>
     <p>“ I know of no so responsible position as that of the public journalist . The editor of our day bears the same relation to his time that the clerk bore to the age before the invention of printing . Indeed , the position which he holds is that which the clergyman should hold even now . But the clergyman chooses to walk off to the extreme edge of the world , and to throw such seed as he has clear over into that darkness which he calls the Next Life . As if next did not mean nearest , and as if any life were nearer than that immediately present one which boils and eddies all around him at the caucus , the ratification meeting , and the polls ! Who taught him to exhort men to prepare for eternity , as for some future era of which the present forms no integral part ? The furrow which Time is even now turning runs through the Everlasting , and in that must he plant , or nowhere . Yet he would fain believe and teach that we are going to have more of eternity than we have now . This going of his is like that of the auctioneer , on which gone follows before we have made up our minds to bid ,— in which manner , not three months back , I lost an excellent copy of Chappelow on Job . So it has come to pass that the preacher , instead of being a living force , has faded into an emblematic figure at christenings , weddings , and funerals . Or , if he exercise any other function , it is as keeper and feeder of certain theologic dogmas , which , when occasion offers , he unkennels with a staboy ! ‘ to bark and bite as ‘ tis their nature to , ’ whence that reproach of odium theologicum has arisen .</p>
     <p>“ Meanwhile , see what a pulpit the editor mounts daily , sometimes with a congregation of fifty thousand within reach of his voice , and never so much as a nodder , even , among them ! And from what a Bible can he choose his text ,— a Bible which needs no translation , and which no priestcraft can shut and clasp from the laity ,— the open volume of the world , upon which , with a pen of sunshine or destroying fire , the inspired Present is even now writing the annals of God ! Methinks the editor who should understand his calling , and be equal thereto , would truly deserve that title of poimen laon , which Homer bestows upon princes . He would be the Moses of our nineteenth century ; and whereas the old Sinai , silent now , is but a common mountain stared at by the elegant tourist and crawled over by the hammering geologist , he must find his tables of the new law here among factories and cities in this Wilderness of Sin ( Numbers xxxiii . 12 ) called Progress of Civilization , and be the captain of our Exodus into the Canaan of a truer social order .</p>
     <p>“ Nevertheless , our editor will not come so far within even the shadow of Sinai as Mahomet did , but chooses rather to construe Moses by Joe Smith . He takes up the crook , not that the sheep may be fed , but that he may never want a warm woollen suit and a joint of mutton .</p>
     <p>Immemor , O , fidei , pecorumque oblite tuorum !</p>
     <p>For which reason I would derive the name editor not so much from edo , to publish , as from edo , to eat , that being the peculiar profession to which he esteems himself called . He blows up the flames of political discord for no other occasion than that he may thereby handily boil his own pot . I believe there are two thousand of these mutton-loving shepherds in the United States , and of these , how many have even the dimmest perception of their immense power , and the duties consequent thereon ? Here and there , haply , one . Nine hundred and ninety-nine labor to impress upon the people the great principles of Tweedledum , and other nine hundred and ninety-nine preach with equal earnestness the gospel according to Tweedledee . ” — H.

       <l n="105">[ I subjoin here another passage from my before-mentioned</l>
       <l n="106">discourse .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Wonderful , to him that has eyes to see it rightly , is the newspaper . To me , for example , sitting on the critical front bench of the pit , in my study here in Jaalam , the advent of my weekly journal is as that of a strolling theatre , or rather of a puppet-show , on whose stage , narrow as it is , the tragedy , comedy , and farce of life are played in little . Behold the whole huge earth sent to me hebdomadally in a brown-paper wrapper !</p>
     <p>“ Hither , to my obscure corner , by wind or steam , on horseback or dromedary-back , in the pouch of the Indian runner , or clicking over the magnetic wires , troop all the famous performers from the four quarters of the globe . Looked at from a point of criticism , tiny puppets they seem all , as the editor sets up his booth upon my desk and officiates as showman . Now I can truly see how little and transitory is life . The earth appears almost as a drop of vinegar , on which the solar microscope of the imagination must be brought to bear in order to make out anything distinctly . That animalcule there , in the pea-jacket , is Louis Philippe , just landed on the coast of England . That other , in the gray surtout and cocked hat , is Napoleon Bonaparte Smith , assuring France that she need apprehend no interference from him in the present alarming juncture . At that spot , where you seem to see a speck of something in motion , is an immense mass-meeting . Look sharper and you will see a mite brandishing his mandibles in an excited manner . That is the great Mr. Soandso , defining his position amid tumultuous and irrepressible cheers . That infinitesimal creature , upon whom some score of others , as minute as he , are gazing in open-mouthed admiration , is a famous philosopher , expounding to a select audience their capacity for the infinite . That scarce discernible pufflet of smoke and dust is a revolution . That speck there is a reformer , just arranging the lever with which he is to move the world . And lo , there creeps forward the shadow of a skeleton that blows one breath between its grinning teeth , and all our distinguished actors are whisked off the slippery stage into the dark Beyond .</p>
     <p>“ Yes , the little show-box has its solemner suggestions . Now and then we catch a glimpse of a grim old man , who lays down a scythe and hour-glass in the corner while he shifts the scenes . There , too , in the dim background , a weird shape is ever delving . Sometimes he leans upon his mattock , and gazes , as a coach whirls by , bearing the newly married on their wedding jaunt , or glances carelessly at a babe brought home from christening . Suddenly ( for the scene grows larger and larger as we look ) a bony hand snatches back a performer in the midst of his part , and him , whom yesterday two infinites ( past and future ) would not suffice , a handful of dust is enough to cover and silence forever . Nay , we see the same fleshless fingers opening to clutch the showman himself , and guess , not without a shudder , that they are lying in wait for spectator also .</p>
     <p>“ Think of it : for three dollars a year I buy a season-ticket to this great Globe Theatre , for which God would write the dramas ( only that we like farces , spectacles , and the tragedies of Apollyon better ) , whose scene-shifter is Time , and whose curtain is rung down by Death .</p>
     <p>“ Such thoughts will occur to me sometimes as I am tearing off the wrapper of my newspaper . Then suddenly that otherwise too often vacant sheet becomes invested for me with a strange kind of awe . Look ! deaths and marriages , notices of inventions , discoveries , and books , lists of promotions , of killed , wounded , and missing , news of fires , accidents , of sudden wealth and as sudden poverty ;— I hold in my hand the ends of myriad invisible electric conductors , along which tremble the joys , sorrows , wrongs , triumphs , hopes , and despairs of as many men and women everywhere . So that upon that mood of mind which seems to isolate me from mankind as a spectator of their puppet-pranks , another supervenes , in which I feel that I , too , unknown and unheard of , am yet of some import to my fellows . For , through my newspaper here , do not families take pains to send me , an entire stranger , news of a death among them ? Are not here two who would have me know of their marriage ? And , strangest of all , is not this singular person anxious to have me informed that he has received a fresh supply of Dimitry Bruisgins ? But to none of us does the President continue miraculous ( even if for a moment discerned as such ) . We glance carelessly at the sunrise , and get used to Orion and the Pleiades . The wonder wears off , and to-morrow this sheet , in which a vision was let down to me from Heaven , shall be the wrappage to a bar of soap or the platter for a beggar 's broken victuals . ” — H.

     <p>A LETTER</p>
     <p>FROM A CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY IN ANSWER TO SUTTIN QUESTIONS PROPOSED BY MR. HOSEA BIGLOW , ENCLOSED IN A NOTE FROM MR. BIGLOW TO S. H. GAY , ESQ ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD .</p>
     <p>[ Curiosity may be said to be the quality which pre-eminently distinguishes and segregates man from the lower animals . As we trace the scale of animated nature downward , we find this faculty ( as it may truly be called ) of the mind diminished in the savage , and quite extinct in the brute . The first object which civilized man proposes to himself I take to be the finding out whatsoever he can concerning his neighbors . Nihil humanum a me alienum puto ; I am curious about even John Smith . The desire next in strength to this ( an opposite pole , indeed , of the same magnet ) is that of communicating the unintelligence we have carefully picked up .</p>
     <p>Men in general may be divided into the inquisitive and the communicative . To the first class belong Peeping Toms , eaves-droppers , navel-contemplating Brahmins , metaphysicians , travellers , Empedocleses , spies , the various societies for promoting Rhinothism , Columbuses , Yankees , discoverers , and men of science , who present themselves to the mind as so many marks of interrogation wandering up and down the world , or sitting in studies and laboratories . The second class I should again subdivide into four . In the first subdivision I would rank those who have an itch to tell us about themselves ,— as keepers of diaries , insignificant persons generally , Montaignes , Horace Walpoles , autobiographers , poets . The second includes those who are anxious to impart information concerning other people ,— as historians , barbers , and such . To the third belong those who labor to give us intelligence about nothing at all ,— as novelists , political orators , the large majority of authors , preachers , lecturers , and the like . In the fourth come those who are communicative from motives of public benevolence ,— as finders of mares ’ - nests and bringers of ill news . Each of us two-legged fowls without feathers embraces all these subdivisions in himself to a greater or less degree , for none of us so much as lays an egg , or incubates a chalk one , but straightway the whole barn-yard shall know it by our cackle or our cluck . Omnibus hoc vitium est . There are different grades in all these classes . One will turn his telescope toward a back-yard , another toward Uranus ; one will tell you that he dined with Smith , another that he supped with Plato . In one particular , all men may be considered as belonging to the first grand division , inasmuch as they all seem equally desirous of discovering the mote in their neighbor 's eye .</p>
     <p>To one or another of these species every human being may safely be referred . I think it beyond a peradventure that Jonah prosecuted some inquiries into the digestive apparatus of whales , and that Noah sealed up a letter in an empty bottle , that news in regard to him might not be wanting in case of the worst . They had else been super or subter human . I conceive , also , that , as there are certain persons who continually peep and pry at the keyhole of that mysterious door through which , sooner or later , we all make our exits , so there are doubtless ghosts fidgetting and fretting on the other side of it , because they have no means of conveying back to this world the scraps of news they have picked up in that . For there is an answer ready somewhere to every question , the great law of give and take runs through all nature , and if we see a hook , we may be sure that an eye is waiting for it . I read in every face I meet a standing advertisement of information wanted in regard to A . B ., or that the friends of C. D. can hear something to his disadvantage by application to such a one .</p>
     <p>It was to gratify the two great passions of asking and answering that epistolary correspondence was first invented . Letters ( for by this usurped title epistles are now commonly known ) are of several kinds . First , there are those which are not letters at all ,— as letters-patent , letters dismissory , letters enclosing bills , letters of administration , Pliny 's letters , letters of diplomacy , of Cato , of Mentor , of Lords Lyttleton , Chesterfield , and Orrery , of Jacob Behmen , Seneca ( whom St. Jerome includes in his list of sacred writers ) , letters from abroad , from sons in college to their fathers , letters of marque , and letters generally , which are in nowise letters of mark . Second , are real letters , such as those of Gray , Cowper , Walpole , Howel , Lamb , D. Y ., the first letters from children , ( printed in staggering capitals ,) Letters from New York , letters of credit , and others , interesting for the sake of the writer or the thing written . I have read also letters from Europe by a gentleman named Pinto , containing some curious gossip , and which I hope to see collected for the benefit of the curious . There are , besides , letters addressed to posterity ,— as epitaphs , for example , written for their own monuments by monarchs , whereby we have lately become possessed of the names of several great conquerors and kings of kings , hitherto unheard of and still unpronounceable , but valuable to the student of the entirely dark ages . The letter which St. Peter sent to King Pepin in the year of grace 755 , that of the Virgin to the magistrates of Messina , that of St. Gregory Thaumaturgus to the D — l , and that of this last-mentioned active police-magistrate to a nun of Girgenti , I would place in a class by themselves , as also the letters of candidates , concerning which I shall dilate more fully in a note at the end of the following poem . At present , sat prata biberunt . Only , concerning the shape of letters , they are all either square or oblong , to which general figures circular letters and round-robins also conform themselves .— H . W .]</p>
     <p>| Deer sir | its gut to be the fashun now to rite letters to the candid 8s and i wus chose at a publick Meetin in Jaalam to du wut wus nessary fur that town . i writ to 271 ginerals and gut ansers to 209. tha air called candid 8s but I do n't see nothin candid about em . this here I wich I send wus thought satty 's factory . I dunno as it 's ushle to print Poscrips , but as all the ansers I got hed the saim , I sposed it wus best . times has gretly changed . Formaly to knock a man into a cocked hat wus to use him up , but now it ony gives him a chance fur the cheef madgustracy .— H . B .</p>

     <p>[ And now of epistles candidatial , which are of two kinds ,— namely , letters of acceptance , and letters definitive of position . Our republic , on the eve of an election , may safely enough be called a republic of letters . Epistolary composition becomes then an epidemic , which seizes one candidate after another , not seldom cutting short the thread of political life . It has come to such a pass , that a party dreads less the attacks of its opponents than a letter from its candidate . Litera scripta manet , and it will go hard if something bad can not be made of it . General Harrison , it is well understood , was surrounded , during his candidacy , with the cordon sanitaire of a vigilance committee . No prisoner in Spielberg was ever more cautiously deprived of writing materials . The soot was scraped carefully from the chimney-places ; outposts of expert rifle-shooters rendered it sure death for any goose ( who came clad in feathers ) to approach within a certain limited distance of North Bend ; and all domestic fowls about the premises were reduced to the condition of Plato 's original man . By these precautions the General was saved . Parva componere magnis , I remember , that , when party-spirit once ran high among my people , upon occasion of the choice of a new deacon , I , having my preferences , yet not caring too openly to express them , made use of an innocent fraud to bring about that result which I deemed most desirable . My stratagem was no other than the throwing a copy of the Complete Letter-Writer in the way of the candidate whom I wished to defeat . He caught the infection , and addressed a short note to his constituents , in which the opposite party detected so many and so grave improprieties , ( he had modelled it upon the letter of a young lady accepting a proposal of marriage ,) that he not only lost his election , but , falling under a suspicion of Sabellianism and I know not what , ( the widow Endive assured me that he was a Paralipomenon , to her certain knowledge ,) was forced to leave the town . Thus it is that the letter killeth .</p>
     <p>The object which candidates propose to themselves in writing is to convey no meaning at all . And here is a quite unsuspected pitfall into which they successively plunge headlong . For it is precisely in such cryptographies that mankind are prone to seek for and find a wonderful amount and variety of significance . Omne ignotum pro mirifico . How do we admire at the antique world striving to crack those oracular nuts from Delphi , Hammon , and elsewhere , in only one of which can I so much as surmise that any kernel had ever lodged ; that , namely , wherein Apollo confessed that he was mortal . One Didymus is , moreover , related to have written six thousand books on the single subject of grammar , a topic rendered only more tenebrific by the labors of his successors , and which seems still to possess an attraction for authors in proportion as they can make nothing of it . A singular loadstone for theologians , also , is the Beast in the Apocalypse , whereof , in the course of my studies , I have noted two hundred and three several interpretations , each lethiferal to all the rest . Non nostrum est tantas componere lites , yet I have myself ventured upon a two hundred and fourth , which I embodied in a discourse preached on occasion of the demise of the late usurper , Napoleon Bonaparte , and which quieted , in a large measure , the minds of my people . It is true that my views on this important point were ardently controverted by Mr. Shearjashub Holden , the then preceptor of our academy , and in other particulars a very deserving and sensible young man , though possessing a somewhat limited knowledge of the Greek tongue . But his heresy struck down no deep root , and , he having been lately removed by the hand of Providence , I had the satisfaction of reaffirming my cherished sentiments in a sermon preached upon the Lord 's day immediately succeeding his funeral . This might seem like taking an unfair advantage , did I not add that he had made provision in his last will ( being celibate ) for the publication of a posthumous tractate in support of his own dangerous opinions .</p>
     <p>I know of nothing in our modern times which approaches so nearly to the ancient oracle as the letter of a Presidential candidate . Now , among the Greeks , the eating of beans was strictly forbidden to all such as had it in mind to consult those expert amphibologists , and this same prohibition on the part of Pythagoras to his disciples is understood to imply an abstinence from politics , beans having been used as ballots . That other explication , quod videlicet sensus eo cibo obtundi existimaret , though supported pugnis et calcibus by many of the learned , and not wanting the countenance of Cicero , is confuted by the larger experience of New England . On the whole , I think it safer to apply here the rule of interpretation which now generally obtains in regard to antique cosmogonies , myths , fables , proverbial expressions , and knotty points generally , which is , to find a common-sense meaning , and then select whatever can be imagined the most opposite thereto . In this way we arrive at the conclusion , that the Greeks objected to the questioning of candidates . And very properly , if , as I conceive , the chief point be not to discover what a person in that position is , or what he will do , but whether he can be elected . Vos exemplaria Graeca nocturna versate manu , versate diurna .</p>
     <p>But , since an imitation of the Greeks in this particular ( the asking of questions being one chief privilege of freemen ) is hardly to be hoped for , and our candidates will answer , whether they are questioned or not , I would recommend that these ante-electionary dialogues should be carried on by symbols , as were the diplomatic correspondences of the Scythians and Macrobii , or confined to the language of signs , like the famous interview of Panurge and Goatsnose . A candidate might then convey a suitable reply to all committees of inquiry by closing one eye , or by presenting them with a phial of Egyptian darkness to be speculated upon by their respective constituencies . These answers would be susceptible of whatever retrospective construction the exigencies of the political campaign might seem to demand , and the candidate could take his position on either side of the fence with entire consistency . Or , if letters must be written , profitable use might be made of the Dighton rock hieroglyphic or the cuneiform script , every fresh decipherer of which is enabled to educe a different meaning , whereby a sculptured stone or two supplies us , and will probably continue to supply posterity , with a very vast and various body of authentic history . For even the briefest epistle in the ordinary chirography is dangerous . There is scarce any style so compressed that superfluous words may not be detected in it . A severe critic might curtail that famous brevity of Caesar 's by two thirds , drawing his pen through the supererogatory veni and vidi . Perhaps , after all , the surest footing of hope is to be found in the rapidly increasing tendency to demand less and less of qualification in candidates . Already have statesmanship , experience , and the possession ( nay , the profession , even ) of principles been rejected as superfluous , and may not the patriot reasonably hope that the ability to write will follow ? At present , there may be death in pot-hooks as well as pots , the loop of a letter may suffice for a bowstring , and all the dreadful heresies of Anti-slavery may lurk in a flourish .— H . W .]</p>

     <p>A SECOND LETTER FROM B. SAWIN , ESQ .</p>
     <p>[ In the following epistle , we behold Mr. Sawin returning , a miles emeritus , to the bosom of his family . Quantum mutatus ! The good Father of us all had doubtless intrusted to the keeping of this child of his certain faculties of a constructive kind . He had put in him a share of that vital force , the nicest economy of every minute atom of which is necessary to the perfect development of Humanity . He had given him a brain and heart , and so had equipped his soul with the two strong wings of knowledge and love , whereby it can mount to hang its nest under the eaves of heaven . And this child , so dowered , he had intrusted to the keeping of his vicar , the State . How stands the account of that stewardship ? The State , or Society , ( call her by what name you will ,) had taken no manner of thought of him till she saw him swept out into the street , the pitiful leavings of last night 's debauch , with cigar-ends , lemon-parings , tobacco-quids , slops , vile stenches , and the whole loathsome next-morning of the bar-room ,— an own child of the Almighty God ! I remember him as he was brought to be christened , a ruddy , rugged babe ; and now there he wallows , reeking , seething ,— the dead corpse , not of a man , but of a soul ,— a putrefying lump , horrible for the life that is in it . Comes the wind of heaven , that good Samaritan , and parts the hair upon his forehead , nor is too nice to kiss those parched , cracked lips ; the morning opens upon him her eyes full of pitying sunshine , the sky yearns down to him ,— and there he lies fermenting . O sleep ! let me not profane thy holy name by calling that stertorous unconsciousness a slumber ! By and by comes along the State , God 's vicar . Does she say ,— “ My poor , forlorn foster-child ! Behold here a force which I will make dig and plant and build for me ? ” Not so , but ,— “ Here is a recruit ready-made to my hand , a piece of destroying energy lying unprofitably idle . ” So she claps an ugly gray suit on him , puts a musket in his grasp , and sends him off , with Gubernatorial and other godspeeds , to do duty as a destroyer .</p>
     <p>I made one of the crowd at the last Mechanics ’ Fair , and , with the rest , stood gazing in wonder at a perfect machine , with its soul of fire , its boiler-heart that sent the hot blood pulsing along the iron arteries , and its thews of steel . And while I was admiring the adaptation of means to end , the harmonious involutions of contrivance , and the never-bewildered complexity , I saw a grimed and greasy fellow , the imperious engine 's lackey and drudge , whose sole office was to let fall , at intervals , a drop or two of oil upon a certain joint . Then my soul said within me , See there a piece of mechanism to which that other you marvel at is but as the rude first effort of a child ,— a force which not merely suffices to set a few wheels in motion , but which can send an impulse all through the infinite future ,— a contrivance , not for turning out pins , or stitching button-holes , but for making Hamlets and Lears . And yet this thing of iron shall be housed , waited on , guarded from rust and dust , and it shall be a crime but so much as to scratch it with a pin ; while the other with its fire of God in it , shall be buffeted hither and thither , and finally sent carefully a thousand miles to be the target for a Mexican cannon-ball . Unthrifty Mother State ! My heart burned within me for pity and indignation , and I renewed this covenant with my own soul ,— In aliis mansuetus ero , at , in blasphemiis contra Christum , non ita .— H . W .]</p>

     <p>[ We have now a tolerably fair chance of estimating how the balance-sheet stands between our returned volunteer and glory . Supposing the entries to be set down on both sides of the account in fractional parts of one hundred , we shall arrive at something like the following result :—</p>
     <p>| B . Sawin |, Esq ., in account with (| Blank |) | Glory |.</p>
     <p>Cr . Dr. By loss of one leg , 20 To one 675th three cheers in " do . one arm , 15 Faneuil Hall , 30 " do . four fingers , 5 " do . do . on occasion of " do . one eye , 10 presentation of sword to " the breaking of six ribs , 6 Colonel Wright , 25 " having served under Colonel " one suit of gray clothes Cushing one month , 44 ( ingeniously unbecoming ) , 15 " musical entertainments ( drum and fife six months ) , 5 " one dinner after return , 1 " chance of pension , 1 " privilege of drawing longbow during rest of natural life , 23</p>
     <p>100 100 E. E .</p>
     <p>It would appear that Mr. Sawin found the actual feast curiously the reverse of the bill of fare advertised in Faneuil Hall and other places . His primary object seems to have been the making of his fortune . Quaerenda pecunia primum , virtus post nummos . He hoisted sail for Eldorado , and shipwrecked on Point Tribulation . Quid non mortalia pectora cogis , auri sacra fames ? The speculation has sometimes crossed my mind , in that dreary interval of drought which intervenes between quarterly stipendiary showers , that Providence , by the creation of a money-tree , might have simplified wonderfully the sometimes perplexing problem of human life . We read of bread-trees , the butter for which lies ready-churned in Irish bogs . Milk-trees we are assured of in South America , and stout Sir John Hawkins testifies to water-trees in the Canaries . Boot-trees bear abundantly in Lynn and elsewhere ; and I have seen , in the entries of the wealthy , hat-trees with a fair show of fruit . A family-tree I once cultivated myself , and found therefrom but a scanty yield , and that quite tasteless and innutritious . Of trees bearing men we are not without examples ; as those in the park of Louis the Eleventh of France . Who has forgotten , moreover , that olive-tree , growing in the Athenian 's back-garden , with its strange uxorious crop , for the general propagation of which , as of a new and precious variety , the philosopher Diogenes , hitherto uninterested in arboriculture , was so zealous ? In the sylva of our own Southern States , the females of my family have called my attention to the china-tree . Not to multiply examples , I will barely add to my list the birch-tree , in the smaller branches of which has been implanted so miraculous a virtue for communicating the Latin and Greek languages , and which may well , therefore , be classed among the trees producing necessaries of life ,— venerabile donum fatalis virgae . That money-trees existed in the golden age there want not prevalent reasons for our believing . For does not the old proverb , when it asserts that money does not grow on every bush , imply a fortiori that there were certain bushes which did produce it ? Again , there is another ancient saw to the effect that money is the root of all evil . From which two adages it may be safe to infer that the aforesaid species of tree first degenerated into a shrub , then absconded underground , and finally , in our iron age , vanished altogether . In favorable exposures it may be conjectured that a specimen or two survived to a great age , as in the garden of the Hesperides ; and , indeed , what else could that tree in the Sixth AEneid have been , with a branch whereof the Trojan hero procured admission to a territory , for the entering of which money is a surer passport than to a certain other more profitable ( too ) foreign kingdom ? Whether these speculations of mine have any force in them , or whether they will not rather , by most readers , be deemed impertinent to the matter in hand , is a question which I leave to the determination of an indulgent posterity . That there were , in more primitive and happier times , shops where money was sold ,— and that , too , on credit and at a bargain ,— I take to be matter of demonstration . For what but a dealer in this article was that AEolus who supplied Ulysses with motive power for his fleet in bags ? What that Ericus , king of Sweden , who is said to have kept the winds in his cap ? What , in more recent times , those Lapland Nornas who traded in favorable breezes ? All which will appear the more clearly when we consider , that , even to this day , raising the wind is proverbial for raising money , and that brokers and banks were invented by the Venetians at a later period .</p>
     <p>And now for the improvement of this digression . I find a parallel to Mr. Sawin 's fortune in an adventure of my own . For , shortly after I had first broached to myself the before-stated natural-historical and archaeological theories , as I was passing , haec negotia penitus mecum revolvens , through one of the obscure suburbs of our New England metropolis , my eye was attracted by these words upon a sign-board ,—| Cheap Cash-Store |. Here was at once the confirmation of my speculations , and the substance of my hopes . Here lingered the fragment of a happier past , or stretched out the first tremulous organic filament of a more fortunate future . Thus glowed the distant Mexico to the eyes of Sawin , as he looked through the dirty pane of the recruiting-office window , or speculated from the summit of that mirage-Pisgah which the imps of the bottle are so cunning in raising up . Already had my Alnaschar-fancy ( even during that first half-believing glance ) expended in various useful directions the funds to be obtained by pledging the manuscript of a proposed volume of discourses . Already did a clock ornament the tower of the Jaalam meeting-house , a gift appropriately , but modestly , commemorated in the parish and town records , both , for now many years , kept by myself . Already had my son Seneca completed his course at the University . Whether , for the moment , we may not be considered as actually lording it over those Baratarias with the viceroyalty of which Hope invests us , and whether we are ever so warmly housed as in our Spanish castles , would afford matter of argument . Enough that I found that sign-board to be no other than a bait to the trap of a decayed grocer . Nevertheless , I bought a pound of dates ( getting short weight by reason of immense flights of harpy flies who pursued and lighted upon their prey even in the very scales ) , which purchase I made , not only with an eye to the little ones at home , but also as a figurative reproof of that too frequent habit of my mind , which , forgetting the due order of chronology , will often persuade me that the happy sceptre of Saturn is stretched over this Astraea-forsaken nineteenth century .</p>
     <p>Having glanced at the ledger of Glory under the title Sawin , B ., let us extend our investigations , and discover if that instructive volume does not contain some charges more personally interesting to ourselves . I think we should be more economical of our resources , did we thoroughly appreciate the fact , that , whenever brother Jonathan seems to be thrusting his hand into his own pocket , he is , in fact , picking ours . I confess that the late muck which the country has been running has materially changed my views as to the best method of raising revenue . If , by means of direct taxation , the bills for every extraordinary outlay were brought under our immediate eye , so that , like thrifty housekeepers , we could see where and how fast the money was going , we should be less likely to commit extravagances . At present , these things are managed in such a hugger-mugger way , that we know not what we pay for ; the poor man is charged as much as the rich ; and , while we are saving and scrimping at the spigot , the government is drawing off at the bung . If we could know that a part of the money we expend for tea and coffee goes to buy powder and balls , and that it is Mexican blood which makes the clothes on our backs more costly , it would set some of us athinking . During the present fall , I have often pictured to myself a government official entering my study and handing me the following bill :—</p>
     <p>| Washington |, Sept. 30 , 1848 .</p>
     <p>| Rev . Homer Wilbur | to | Uncle Samuel |,</p>
     <p>Dr. To his share of work done in Mexico on partnership account , sundry jobs , as below .</p>
     <p>" killing , maiming , and wounding about 5 , 000 Mexicans , $ 2. 00 " slaughtering one woman carrying water to wounded ,. 10 " extra work on two different Sabbaths ( one bombardment and one assault ) whereby the Mexicans were prevented from defiling themselves with the idolatries of high mass , 3. 50 “ throwing an especially fortunate and Protestant bombshell into the Cathedral at Vera Cruz , whereby several female Papists were slain at the altar ,. 50 “ his proportion of cash paid for conquered territory , 1. 75 " do . do . for conquering do . 1. 50 “ manuring do . with new superior compost called “ American Citizen , ”. 50 “ extending the area of freedom and Protestantism ,. 01 “ glory ,. 01</p>
     <p>$ 9. 87 Immediate payment is requested .</p>
     <p>N. B. Thankful for former favors , U. S. requests a continuance of patronage . Orders executed with neatness and despatch . Terms as low as those of any other contractor for the same kind and style of work .</p>
     <p>I can fancy the official answering my look of horror with ,— “ Yes , Sir , it looks like a high charge , Sir : but in these days slaughtering is slaughtering . ” Verily , I would that every one understood that it was ; for it goes about obtaining money under the false pretence of being glory . For me , I have an imagination which plays me uncomfortable tricks . It happens to me sometimes to see a slaughterer on his way home from his day 's work , and forthwith my imagination puts a cocked-hat upon his head and epaulettes upon his shoulders , and sets him up as a candidate for the Presidency . So , also , on a recent public occasion , as the place assigned to the “ Reverend Clergy ” is just behind that of “ Officers of the Army and Navy ” in processions , it was my fortune to be seated at the dinner-table over against one of these respectable persons . He was arrayed as ( out of his own profession ) only kings , court-officers , and footmen are in Europe , and Indians in America . Now what does my over-officious imagination but set to work upon him , strip him of his gay livery , and present him to me coatless , his trowsers thrust into the tops of a pair of boots thick with clotted blood , and a basket on his arm out of which lolled a gore-smeared axe , thereby destroying my relish for the temporal mercies upon the board before me !— H . W .]</p>
     <p>No . IX .</p>
     <p>A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN , ESQ .</p>
     <p>[ Upon the following letter slender comment will be needful . In what river Selemnus has Mr. Sawin bathed , that he has become so swiftly oblivious of his former loves ? From an ardent and ( as befits a soldier ) confident wooer of that coy bride , the popular favor , we see him subside of a sudden into the ( I trust not jilted ) Cincinnatus , returning to his plough with a goodly-sized branch of willow in his hand ; figuratively returning , however , to a figurative plough , and from no profound affection for that honored implement of husbandry , ( for which , indeed , Mr. Sawin never displayed any decided predilection ,) but in order to be gracefully summoned therefrom to more congenial labors . It would seem that the character of the ancient Dictator had become part of the recognized stock of our modern political comedy , though , as our term of office extends to a quadrennial length , the parallel is not so minutely exact as could be desired . It is sufficiently so , however , for purposes of scenic representation . An humble cottage ( if built of logs , the better ) forms the Arcadian background of the stage . This rustic paradise is labelled Ashland , Jaalam , North Bend , Marshfield , Kinderhook , or Baton Rouge , as occasion demands . Before the door stands a something with one handle ( the other painted in proper perspective ) , which represents , in happy ideal vagueness , the plough . To this the defeated candidate rushes with delirous joy , welcomed as a father by appropriate groups of happy laborers , or from it the successful one is torn with difficulty , sustained alone by a noble sense of public duty . Only I have observed , that , if the scene be laid at Baton Rouge or Ashland , the laborers are kept carefully in the background , and are heard to shout from behind the scenes in a singular tone resembling ululation , and accompanied by a sound not unlike vigorous clapping . This , however , may be artistically in keeping with the habits of the rustic population of those localities . The precise connection between agricultural pursuits and statesmanship I have not been able , after diligent inquiry , to discover . But , that my investigations may not be barren of all fruit , I will mention one curious statistical fact , which I consider thoroughly established , namely , that no real farmer ever attains practically beyond a seat in General Court , however theoretically qualified for more exalted station .</p>
     <p>It is probable that some other prospect has been opened to Mr. Sawin , and that he has not made this great sacrifice without some definite understanding in regard to a seat in the cabinet or a foreign mission . It may be supposed that we of Jaalam were not untouched by a feeling of villatic pride in beholding our townsman occupying so large a space in the public eye . And to me , deeply revolving the qualifications necessary to a candidate in these frugal times , those of Mr. S. seemed peculiarly adapted to a successful campaign . The loss of a leg , an arm , an eye , and four fingers , reduced him so nearly to the condition of a vox et praeterea nihil , that I could think of nothing but the loss of his head by which his chance could have been bettered . But since he has chosen to baulk our suffrages , we must content ourselves with what we can get , remembering lactucas non esse dandas , dum cardui sufficiant .— H . W .]</p>

     <p>[ Here , patient reader , we take leave of each other , I trust with some mutual satisfaction . I say patient , for I love not that kind which skims dippingly over the surface of the page , as swallows over a pool before rain . By such no pearls shall be gathered . But if no pearls there be ( as , indeed , the world is not without example of books wherefrom the longest-winded diver shall bring up no more than his proper handful of mud ) , yet let us hope that an oyster or two may reward adequate perseverance . If neither pearls nor oysters , yet is patience itself a gem worth diving deeply for .</p>
     <p>It may seem to some that too much space has been usurped by my own private lucubrations , and some may be fain to bring against me that old jest of him who preached all his hearers out of the meetinghouse save only the sexton , who , remaining for yet a little space , from a sense of official duty , at last gave out also , and , presenting the keys , humbly requested our preacher to lock the doors , when he should have wholly relieved himself of his testimony . I confess to a satisfaction in the self act of preaching , nor do I esteem a discourse to be wholly thrown away even upon a sleeping or unintelligent auditory . I cannot easily believe that the Gospel of Saint John , which Jacques Cartier ordered to be read in the Latin tongue to the Canadian savages , upon his first meeting with them , fell altogether upon stony ground . For the earnestness of the preacher is a sermon appreciable by dullest intellects and most alien ears . In this wise did Episcopius convert many to his opinions , who yet understood not the language in which he discoursed . The chief thing is that the messenger believe that he has an authentic message to deliver . For counterfeit messengers that mode of treatment which Father John de Plano Carpini relates to have prevailed among the Tartars would seem effectual , and , perhaps , deserved enough . For my own part , I may lay claim to so much of the spirit of martyrdom as would have led me to go into banishment with those clergymen whom Alphonso the Sixth of Portugal drave out of his kingdom for refusing to shorten their public eloquence . It is possible , that , having been invited into my brother Biglow 's desk , I may have been too little scrupulous in using it for the venting of my own peculiar doctrines to a congregation drawn together in the expectation and with the desire of hearing him .</p>
     <p>I am not wholly unconscious of a peculiarity of mental organization which impels me , like the railroad-engine with its train of cars , to run backward for a short distance in order to obtain a fairer start . I may compare myself to one fishing from the rocks when the sea runs high , who , misinterpreting the suction of the undertow for the biting of some larger fish , jerks suddenly , and finds that he has caught bottom , hauling in upon the end of his line a trail of various algae , among which , nevertheless , the naturalist may haply find something to repay the disappointment of the angler . Yet have I conscientiously endeavored to adapt myself to the impatient temper of the age , daily degenerating more and more from the high standard of our pristine New England . To the catalogue of lost arts I would mournfully add also that of listening to two-hour sermons . Surely we have been abridged into a race of pigmies . For , truly , in those of the old discourses yet subsisting to us in print , the endless spinal column of divisions and subdivisions can be likened to nothing so exactly as to the vertebrae of the saurians , whence the theorist may conjecture a race of Anakim proportionate to the withstanding of these other monsters . I say Anakim rather than Nephelim , because there seem reasons for supposing that the race of those whose heads ( though no giants ) are constantly enveloped in clouds ( which that name imports ) will never become extinct . The attempt to vanquish the innumerable heads of one of those aforementioned discourses may supply us with a plausible interpretation of the second labor of Hercules , and his successful experiment with fire affords us a useful precedent .</p>
     <p>But while I lament the degeneracy of the age in this regard , I cannot refuse to succumb to its influence . Looking out through my study-window , I see Mr. Biglow at a distance busy in gathering his Baldwins , of which , to judge by the number of barrels lying about under the trees , his crop is more abundant than my own ,— by which sight I am admonished to turn to those orchards of the mind wherein my labors may be more prospered , and apply myself diligently to the preparation of my next Sabbath 's discourse .— H .

THE UNHAPPY LOT OF MR. KNOTT . 1850 . THE UNHAPPY LOT OF MR. KNOTT . PART I . SHOWING HOW HE BUILT HIS HOUSE AND HIS WIFE MOVED INTO IT . My worthy friend , A. Gordon Knott , From business snug withdrawn , Was much contented with a lot That would contain a Tudor cot ‘ Twixt twelve feet square of garden-plot , And twelve feet more of lawn . He had laid business on the shelf To give his taste expansion , And , since no man , retired with pelf . The building mania can shun , Knott , being middle-aged himself , Resolved to build ( unhappy elf ! ) A mediaeval mansion . He called an architect in counsel ; “ I want , ” said he , “ a — you know what ( You are a builder , I am Knott ,) A thing complete from chimney-pot Down to the very grounsel ; Here 's a half-acre of good land ; Just have it nicely mapped and planned And make your workmen drive on ; Meadow there is , and upland too , And I should like a water-view , D ’ you think you could contrive one ? ( Perhaps the pump and trough would do . If painted a judicious blue ? ) The woodland I 've attended to ; ” ( He meant three pines stuck up askew , Two dead ones and a live one . ) “ A pocket-full of rocks ‘ t would take To build a house of free-stone , But then it is not hard to make What now-a-days is the stone ; The cunning painter in a trice Your house 's outside petrifies , And people think it very gneiss Without inquiring deeper ; My money never shall be thrown Away on such a deal of stone , When stone of deal is cheaper . ” And so the greenest of antiques Was reared for Knott to dwell in ; The architect worked hard for weeks In venting all his private peaks Upon the roof , whose crop of leaks Had satisfied Fluellen ; Whatever any body had Out of the common , good or bad , Knott had it all worked well in , A donjon-keep , where clothes might dry , A porter 's lodge that was a sty , A campanile slim and high , Too small to hang a bell in ; All up and down and here and there , With Lord-knows-whats of round and square Stuck on at random every where ,— It was a house to make one stare , All corners and all gables ; Like dogs let loose upon a bear , Ten emulous styles staboyed with care , The whole among them seemed to tear , And all the oddities to spare Were set upon the stables . Knott was delighted with a pile Approved by fashion 's leaders ; ( Only he made the builder smile , By asking , every little while , Why that was called the Twodoor style , Which certainly had three doors ? ) Yet better for this luckless man If he had put a downright ban Upon the thing in limine ; For , though to quit affairs his plan , Ere many days , poor Knott began Perforce , accepting draughts that ran All ways — except up chimney ; The house , though painted stone to mock , With nice white lines round every block , Some trepidation stood in , When tempests ( with petrific shock , So to speak ,) made it really rock , Though not a whit less wooden ; And painted stone , howe'er well done , Will not take in the prodigal sun Whose beams are never quite at one With our terrestrial lumber ; So the wood shrank around the knots , And gaped in disconcerting spots , And there were lots of dots and rots And crannies without number , Wherethrough , as you may well presume , The wind , like water through a flume , Came rushing in ecstatic , Leaving , in all three floors , no room That was not a rheumatic ; And , what with points and squares and rounds Grown shaky on their poises , The house at night was full of pounds , Thumps , bumps , creaks , scratchings , raps — till — “ Zounds ! ” Cried Knott , “ this goes beyond all bounds , I do not deal in tongues and sounds , Nor have I let my house and grounds To a family of Noyeses ! ” But , though Knott 's house was full of airs , He had but one — a daughter ; And , as he owned much stocks and shares , Many who wished to render theirs Such vain , unsatisfying cares , And needed wives to sew their tears , In matrimony sought her ; They vowed her gold they wanted not , Their faith would never falter , They longed to tie this single Knott In the Hymenaeal halter ; So daily at the door they rang , Cards for the belle delivering , Or in the choir at her they sang , Achieving such a rapturous twang As set her nerves a-shivering . Now Knott had quite made up his mind That Colonel Jones should have her ; No beauty he , but oft we find Sweet kernels ‘ neath a roughish rind , So hoped his Jenny 'd be resigned And make no more palaver ; Glanced at the fact that love was blind , That girls were ratherish inclined To pet their little crosses , Then nosologically defined The rate at which the system pined In those unfortunates who dined Upon that metaphoric kind Of dish — their own proboscis . But she , with many tears and moans , Besought him not to mock her , Said ‘ twas too much for flesh and bones To marry mortgages and loans , That fathers ’ hearts were stocks and stones And that she 'd go , when Mrs. Jones , To Davy Jones 's locker ; Then gave her head a little toss That said as plain as ever was , If men are always at a loss Mere womankind to bridle — To try the thing on woman cross , Were fifty times as idle ; For she a strict resolve had made And registered in private , That either she would die a maid , Or else be Mrs . Doctor Slade , If woman could contrive it ; And , though the wedding-day was set , Jenny was more so , rather , Declaring , in a pretty pet , That , howsoe'er they spread their net , She would out-Jennyral them yet , The colonel and her father . Just at this time the Public 's eyes Were keenly on the watch , a stir Beginning slowly to arise About those questions and replies , Those raps that unwrapped mysteries So rapidly at Rochester , And Knott , already nervous grown By lying much awake alone , And listening , sometimes to a moan , And sometimes to a clatter , Whene'er the wind at night would rouse The gingerbread-work on his house , Or when some hasty-tempered mouse , Behind the plastering , made a towse About a family matter , Began to wonder if his wife , A paralytic half her life , Which made it more surprising , Might not to rule him from her urn , Have taken a peripatetic turn For want of exorcising . This thought , once nestled in his head , Ere long contagious grew , and spread Infecting all his mind with dread , Until at last he lay in bed And heard his wife , with well-known tread , Entering the kitchen through the shed , ( Or was't his fancy , mocking ? ) Opening the pantry , cutting bread , And then ( she 'd been some ten years dead ) Closets and drawers unlocking ; Or , in his room ( his breath grew thick ) He heard the long-familiar click Of slender needles flying quick , As if she knit a stocking ; For whom ?— he prayed that years might flit With pains rheumatic shooting , Before those ghostly things she knit Upon his unfleshed sole might fit , He did not fancy it a bit , To stand upon that footing ; At other times , his frightened hairs Above the bedclothes trusting , He heard her , full of household cares , ( No dream entrapped in supper 's snares , The foal of horrible nightmares , But broad awake , as he declares ,) Go bustling up and down the stairs , Or setting back last evening 's chairs , Or with the poker thrusting The raked-up sea-coal 's hardened crust — And — what ! impossible ! it must ! He knew she had returned to dust , And yet could scarce his senses trust , Hearing her as she poked and fussed About the parlor , dusting ! Night after night he strove to sleep And take his ease in spite of it ; But still his flesh would chill and creep , And , though two night-lamps he might keep , He could not so make light of it . At last , quite desperate , he goes And tells his neighbors all his woes , Which did but their amount enhance ; They made such mockery of his fears That soon his days were of all jeers , His nights of the rueful countenance ; “ I thought most folks , ” one neighbor said , “ Gave up the ghost when they were dead , ” Another gravely shook his head , Adding , “ from all we hear , it 's Quite plain poor Knott is going mad — For how can he at once be sad And think he 's full of spirits ? ” A third declared he knew a knife Would cut this Knott much quicker , “ The surest way to end all strife , And lay the spirit of a wife , Is just to take and lick her ! ” A temperance man caught up the word , “ Ah , yes , ” he groaned , “ I 've always heard Our poor friend somewhat slanted Tow'rd taking liquor over-much ; I fear these spirits may be Dutch , ( A sort of gins , or something such ,) With which his house is haunted ; I see the thing as clear as light — If Knott would give up getting tight , Naught farther would be wanted : ” So all his neighbors stood aloof And , that the spirits ‘ neath his roof Were not entirely up to proof , Unanimously granted . Knott knew that cocks and sprites were foes , And so bought up , Heaven only knows How many , though he wanted crows To give ghosts caws , as I suppose , To think that day was breaking ; Moreover what he called his park , He turned into a kind of ark For dogs , because a little bark Is a good tonic in the dark , If one is given to waking ; But things went on from bad to worse , His curs were nothing but a curse , And , what was still more shocking , Foul ghosts of living fowl made scoff And would not think of going off In spite of all his cocking . Shanghais , Bucks-counties , Dominiques , Malays ( that did n't lay for weeks ) . Polanders , Bantams , Dorkings , ( Waiving the cost , no trifling ill , Since each brought in his little bill ,) By day or night were never still , But every thought of rest would kill With cacklings and with quorkings ; Henry the Eighth of wives got free By a way he had of axing ; But poor Knott 's Tudor henery Was not so fortunate , and he Still found his trouble waxing ; As for the dogs , the rows they made , And how they howled , snarled , barked and bayed , Beyond all human knowledge is ; All night , as wide awake as gnats , The terriers rumpused after rats , Or , just for practice , taught their brats To worry cast-off shoes and hats , The bull-dogs settled private spats , All chased imaginary cats , Or raved behind the fence 's slats At real ones , or , from their mats , With friends , miles off , held pleasant chats , Or , like some folks in white cravats , Contemptuous of sharps and flats , Sat up and sang dogsologies . Meanwhile the cats set up a squall , And , safe upon the garden-wall , All night kept cat-a-walling ; As if the feline race were all , In one wild cataleptic sprawl , Into love 's tortures falling . PART II . SHOWING WHAT IS MEANT BY A FLOW OF SPIRITS . At first the ghosts were somewhat shy , Coming when none but Knott was nigh , And people said ‘ twas all their eye , ( Or rather his ) a flam , the sly Digestion 's machination ; Some recommended a wet sheet , Some a nice broth of pounded peat , Some a cold flat-iron to the feet , Some a decoction of lamb'shYpppHeNbleat , Some a southwesterly grain of wheat ; Meat was by some pronounced unmeet , Others thought fish most indiscreet , And that ‘ twas worse than all to eat Of vegetables , sour or sweet , ( Except , perhaps , the skin of beat ,) In such a concatenation : One quack his button gently plucks And murmurs “ biliary ducks ! ” Says Knott , “ I never ate one ; ” But all , though brimming full of wrath , Homoeo , Allo , Hydropath , Concurred in this — that t ’ other 's path To death 's door was the straight one Still , spite of medical advice , The ghosts came thicker , and a spice Of mischief grew apparent ; Nor did they only come at night , But seemed to fancy broad daylight , Till Knott , in horror and affright , His unoffending hair rent ; Whene'er with handkerchief on lap , He made his elbow-chair a trap , To catch an after-dinner nap , The spirits , always on the tap , Would , make a sudden rap , rap , rap , The half-spun cord of sleep to snap , ( And what is life without its nap But threadbareness and mere mishap ? ) As ‘ t were with a percussion cap The trouble 's climax capping ; It seemed a party dried and grim Of mummies had come to visit him , Each getting off from every limb Its multitudinous wrapping ; Scratchings sometimes the walls ran round , The merest penny-weights of sound ; Sometimes ‘ twas only by the pound They carried on their dealing , A thumping ‘ neath the parlor floor , Thump-bump-thump-bumping o'er and o'er , As if the vegetables in store , ( Quiet and orderly before ,) Were all together pealing ; You would have thought the thing was done By the spirit of some son of a gun , And that a forty-two pounder , Or that the ghost which made such sounds Could be none other than John Pounds , Of Ragged Schools the founder . Through three gradations of affright , The awful noises reached their height ; At first they knocked nocturnally , Then , for some reason , changing quite , ( As mourners , after six months ’ flight , Turn suddenly from dark to light ,) Began to knock diurnally , And last , combining all their stocks , ( Scotland was ne'er so full of Knox ,) Into one Chaos ( father of Nox ,) Nocte pluit — they showered knocks , And knocked , knocked , knocked eternally Ever upon the go , like buoys , ( Wooden sea-urchins ,) all Knott 's joys , They turned to troubles and a noise That preyed on him internally . Soon they grew wider in their scope ; Whenever Knott a door would ope , It would ope not , or else elope And fly back ( curbless as a trope Once started down a stanza 's slope By a bard that gave it too much rope —) Like a clap of thunder slamming ; And , when kind Jenny brought his hat , ( She always , when he walked , did that ,) Just as upon his head it sat , Submitting to his settling pat — Some unseen hand would jam it flat , Or give it such a furious bat That eyes and nose went cramming Up out of sight , and consequently , As when in life it paddled free , His beaver caused much damning ; If these things seemed o'erstrained to be , Read the account of Docter Dee , ‘ Tis in our college library ; Read Wesley 's circumstantial plea , And Mrs. Crowe , more like a bee , Sucking the nightshade 's honeyed fee , And Stilling 's Pneumatology ; Consult Scot , Glanvil , and grave Wierus , and both Mathers ; further , see Webster , Gasaubon , James First 's treatise , a right royal Q. E. D. Writ with the moon in perigee , Bodin de Demonomanie — ( Accent that last line gingerly ) All full of learning as the sea Of fishes , and all disagree , Save in Sathanas apage ! Or , what will surely put a flea In unbelieving ears — with glee , Out of a paper ( sent to me By some friend who forgot to P ... A ... Y ...,— I use cryptography Lest I his vengeful pen should dree — His P ... O ... S ... T ... A ... G ... E ...) Things to the same effect I cut , About the tantrums of a ghost , Not more than three weeks since , at most , Near Stratford , in Connecticut . Knott 's Upas daily spread its roots , Sent up on all sides livelier shoots , And bore more pestilential fruits ; The ghosts behaved like downright brutes , They snipped holes in his Sunday suits , Practised all night on octave flutes , Put peas ( not peace ) into his boots , Whereof grew corns in season , They scotched his sheets , and , what was worse , Stuck his silk night-cap full of burs , Till he , in language plain and terse , ( But much unlike a Bible verse ,) Swore he should lose his reason . The tables took to spinning , too , Perpetual yarns , and arm-chairs grew To prophets and apostles ; One footstool vowed that only he Of law and gospel held the key , That teachers of whate'er degree To whom opinion bows the knee Were n't fit to teach Truth 's a. b. c. And were ( the whole lot ) to a T. Mere fogies all and fossils ; A teapoy , late the property Of Knox 's Aunt Keziah , ( Whom Jenny most irreverently Had nicknamed her aunt-tipathy ) With tips emphatic claimed to be The prophet Jeremiah ; The tins upon the kitchen-wall , Turned tintinnabulators all , And things that used to come at call For simple household services , Began to hop and whirl and prance , Fit to put out of countenance The Commis and Grisettes of France Or Turkey 's dancing Dervises . Of course such doings , far and wide , With rumors filled the country-side , And ( as it is our nation 's pride To think a Truth not verified Till with majorities allied ,) Parties sprang up , affirmed , denied , And candidates with questions plied Who , like the circus-riders , tried At once both hobbies to bestride , And each with his opponent vied In being inexplicit . Earnest inquirers multiplied ; Folks , whose tenth cousins lately died , Wrote letters long , and Knott replied . All who could either walk or ride , Gathered to wonder or deride , And paid the house a visit ; Horses were at his pine-trees tied , Mourners in every corner sighed , Widows brought children there that cried , Swarms of lean Seekers , eager-eyed , ( People Knott never could abide ,) Into each hole and cranny pried With strings of questions cut and dried From the Devout Inquirer 's Guide , For the wise spirits to decide — As , for example , is it True that the damned are fried or boiled ? Was the Earth 's axis greased or oiled ? Who cleaned the moon when it was soiled ? How baldness might be cured or foiled ? How heal diseased potatoes ? Did spirits have the sense of smell ? Where would departed spinsters dwell ? If the late Zenas Smith were well ? If Earth were solid or a shell ? Were spirits fond of Doctor Fell ? Did the bull toll Cock-Robin 's knell ? What remedy would bugs expel ? If Paine 's invention were a sell ? Did spirits by Webster 's system spell ? Was it a sin to be a belle ? Did dancing sentence folks to hell ? If so , then where most torture fell — On little toes or great toes ? If life 's true seat were in the brain ? Did Ensign mean to marry Jane ? By whom , in fact , was Morgan slain ? Could matter ever suffer pain ? What would take out a cherry-stain ? Who picked the pocket of Seth Crane , Of Waldo precinct , State of Maine ? Was Sir John Franklin sought in vain ? Did primitive Christians ever train ? What was the family-name of Cain ? Them spoons , were they by Betty ta'en ? Would earth-worm poultice cure a sprain ? Was Socrates so dreadful plain ? What teamster guided Charles 's wain ? Was Uncle Ethan mad or sane , And could his will in force remain ? If not , what counsel to retain ? Did Le Sage steal Gil Bias from Spain ? Was Junius writ by Thomas Paine ? Were ducks discomforted by rain ? How did Britannia rule the main ? Was Jonas coming back again ? Was vital truth upon the wane ? Did ghosts , to scare folks , drag a chain ? Who was our Huldah 's chosen swain ? Did none have teeth pulled without payin ’ Ere ether was invented ? Whether mankind would not agree , If the universe were tuned in C .? What was it ailed Lucindy 's knee ? Whether folks eat folks in Feejee ? Whether his name would end with T .? If Saturn 's rings were two or three , And what bump in Phrenology They truly represented ? These problems dark , wherein they groped , Wherewith man 's reason vainly coped , Now that the spirit-world was oped , In all humility they hoped Would be resolved instanter ; Each of the miscellaneous rout Brought his , or her , own little doubt , And wished to pump the spirits out , Through his , or her , own private spout , Into his , or her decanter . PART III . WHEREIN IT IS SHOWN THAT THE MOST ARDENT SPIRITS ARE MORE ORNAMENTAL THAN USEFUL . Many a speculating wight Came by express-trains , day and night , To see if Knott would “ sell his right , ” Meaning to make the ghosts a sight — What they call a “ meenaygerie ; ” One threatened , if he would not “ trade , ” His run of custom to invade , ( He could not these sharp folks persuade That he was not , in some way , paid ,) And stamp him as a plagiary , By coming down at one fell swoop , With | THE | ORIGINAL | KNOCKING TROUPE |, Come recently from Hades , Who ( for a quarter-dollar heard ) Would ne'er rap out a hasty word Whence any blame might be incurred From the most fastidious ladies ; The late lamented Jesse Soule To stir the ghosts up with a pole And be director of the whole , Who was engaged the rather For the rare merits he 'd combine , Having been in the spirit line , Which trade he only did resign , With general applause , to shine , Awful in mail of cotton fine , As ghost of Hamlet 's father ! Another a fair plan reveals Never yet hit on , which , he feels , To Knott 's religious sense appeals — “ We 'll have your house set up on wheels , A speculation pious ; For music , we can shortly find A barrel-organ that will grind Psalm-tunes — an instrument designed For the New England tour — refined From secular drosses , and inclined To an unworldly turn , ( combined With no sectarian bias ;) Then , travelling by stages slow , Under the style of Knott &amp; Co ., I would accompany the show As moral lecturer , the foe Of nationalism ; you could throw The rappings in , and make them go Strict Puritan principles , you know , ( How do you make ‘ em ? with your toe ? ) And the receipts which thence might flow , We could divide between us ; Still more attractions to combine , Beside these services of mine , I will throw in a very fine ( It would do nicely for a sign ) Original Titian 's Venus . ” Another offered handsome fees If Knott would get Demosthenes , ( Nay , his mere knuckles , for more ease ,) To rap a few short sentences ; Or if , for want of proper keys , His Greek might make confusion , Then just to get a rap from Burke , To recommend a little work On Public Elocution . Meanwhile , the spirits made replies To all the reverent whats and whys Resolving doubts of every size , And giving seekers grave and wise , Who came to know their destinies , A rap-turous reception ; When unbelievers void of grace Came to investigate the place , ( Creatures of Sadducistic race , With grovelling intellects and base ) , They could not find the slightest trace To indicate deception ; Indeed , it is declared by some That spirits ( of this sort ) are glum , Almost , or wholly , deaf and dumb , And ( out of self-respect ) quite mum To sceptic natures cold and numb , Who of this kind of Kingdom Come Have not a just conception ; True , there were people who demurred That , though the raps no doubt were heard Both under them and o'er them , Yet , somehow , when a search they made , They found Miss Jenny sore afraid , Or Jenny 's lover , Doctor Slade , Equally awe-struck and dismayed , Or Deborah , the chamber-maid , Whose terrors , not to be gainsaid , In laughs hysteric were displayed , Was always there before them ; This had its due effect with some Who straight departed , muttering , Hum ! Transparent hoax ! and Gammon ! But these were few : believing souls Came , day by day , in larger shoals , As the ancients to the windy holes ‘ Neath Delphi 's tripod brought their doles , Or to the shrine of Ammon . The spirits seemed exceeding tame , Call whom you fancied , and he came ; The shades august of eldest fame You summoned with an awful ease ; As grosser spirits gurgled out From chair and table with a spout , In Auerbach 's cellar once , to flout The senses of the rabble rout , Where'er the gimlet twirled about Of cunning Mephistophiles — So did these spirits seem in store , Behind the wainscot or the door , Ready to thrill the being 's core Of every enterprising bore With their astounding glamour ; Whatever ghost one wished to hear , By strange coincidence , was near To make the past or future clear , ( Sometimes in shocking grammar ,) By raps and taps , now there , now here — It seemed as if the spirit queer Of some departed auctioneer Were doomed to practise by the year With the spirit of his hammer ; Whate'er you asked was answered , yet One could not very deeply get Into the obliging spirits ’ debt , Because they used the alphabet In all communications , And new revealings ( though sublime ) Rapped out , one letter at a time , With boggles , hesitations , Stoppings , beginnings o'er again , And getting matters into train , Could hardly overload the brain With too excessive rations , Since just to ask if two and two Really make four ? or , How d ’ ye do ? And get the fit replies thereto In the tramundane rat-tat-too , Might ask a whole day 's patience . ‘ Twas strange ( ‘ mongst other things ) to find In what odd sets the ghosts combined , Happy forthwith to thump any Piece of intelligence inspired , The truth whereof had been inquired By some one of the company ; For instance , Fielding , Mirabeau , Orator Henley , Cicero , Paley , John Zisca , Marivaux , Melancthon , Robertson , Junot , Scaliger , Chesterfield , Rousseau , Hakluyt , Boccaccio , South , De Foe , Diaz , Josephus , Richard Roe , Odin , Arminius , Charles le gros , Tiresias , the late James Crow , Casabianca , Grose , Prideaux , Old Grimes , Young Norval , Swift , Brissot , Maimonides , the Chevalier D'O , Socrates , Fenelon , Job , Stow , The inventor of Elixir pro , Euripides , Spinoza , Poe , Confucius , Hiram Smith , and Fo , Came ( as it seemed , somewhat de trop ) With a disembodied Esquimaux , To say that it was so and so , With Franklin 's expedition ; One testified to ice and snow , One that the mercury was low , One that his progress was quite slow , One that he much desired to go , One that the cook had frozen his toe , ( Dissented from by Dandolo , Wordsworth , Cynaegirus , Boileau , La Hontan , and Sir Thomas Roe ,) One saw twelve white bears in a row , One saw eleven and a crow , With other things we could not know ( Of great statistic value , though ) By our mere mortal vision . Sometimes the spirits made mistakes , And seemed to play at ducks and drakes With bold inquiry 's heaviest stakes In science or in mystery ; They knew so little ( and that wrong ) Yet rapped it out so bold and strong , One would have said the entire throng Had been Professors of History ; What made it odder was , that those Who , you would naturally suppose , Could solve a question , if they chose , As easily as count their toes , Were just the ones that blundered ; One day , Ulysses , happening down , A reader of Sir Thomas Browne And who ( with him ) had wondered What song it was the Sirens sang , Asked the shrewd Ithacan — bang ! bang ! With this response the chamber rang , “ I guess it was Old Hundred . ” And Franklin , being asked to name The reason why the lightning came , Replied , “ Because it thundered . ” On one sole point the ghosts agreed , One fearful point , than which , indeed , Nothing could seem absurder ; Poor Colonel Jones they all abused , And finally downright accused The poor old man of murder ; ‘ Twas thus ; by dreadful raps was shown . Some spirit 's longing to make known A bloody fact , which he alone Was privy to , ( such ghosts more prone In Earth 's affairs to meddle are ;) Who are you ? with awe-stricken looks , All ask : his airy knuckles he crooks , And raps , “ I was Eliab Snooks , That used to be a peddler ; Some on ye still are on my books ! ” Whereat , to inconspicuous nooks , ( More fearing this than common spooks ,) Shrank each indebted meddler ; Further the vengeful ghost declared That while his earthly life was spared , About the country he had fared , A duly licensed follower Of that much-wandering trade that wins Slow profit from the sale of tins And various kinds of hollow-ware ; That Colonel Jones enticed him in , Pretending that he wanted tin , There slew him with a rolling-pin , Hid him in a potatoe-bin , And ( the same night ) him ferried Across Great Pond to t ’ other shore , And there , on land of Widow Moore , Just where you turn to Larkin 's store , Under a rock him buried ; Some friends ( who happened , to be by ) He called upon to testify That what he said was not a lie , And that he did not stir this Foul matter , out of any spite But from a simple love of right ;— Which statements the Nine Worthies , Rabbi Akiba , Charlemagne , Seth , Colley Cibber , General Wayne , Cambyses , Tasso , Tubal-Cain , The owner of a castle in Spain , Jehanghire , and the Widow of Nain , ( The friends aforesaid ) made more plain And by loud raps attested ; To the same purport testified Plato , John Wilkes , and Colonel Pride Who knew said Snooks before he died , Had in his wares invested , Thought him entitled to belief And freely could concur , in brief , In everything the rest did . Eliab this occasion seized , ( Distinctly here the spirit sneezed ,) To say that he should ne'er be eased Till Jenny married whom she pleased , Free from all checks and urgin 's , ( This spirit dropt his final g 's ) And that , unless Knott quickly sees This done , the spirits to appease , They would come back his life to tease , As thick as mites in ancient cheese , And let his house on an endless lease To the ghosts ( terrific rappers these And veritable Eumenides ) Of the Eleven Thousand Virgins ! Knott was perplexed and shook his head . He did not wish his child to wed With a suspected murderer , ( For , true or false , the rumor spread ) But as for this roiled life he led , “ It would not answer , ” so he said , “ To have it go no furderer . ” At last , scarce knowing what it meant , Reluctantly he gave consent That Jenny , since ‘ twas evident That she would follow her own bent , Should make her own election . For that appeared the only way These frightful noises to allay Which had already turned him gray And plunged him in dejection . Accordingly , this artless maid Her father 's ordinance obeyed , And , all in whitest crape arrayed , ( Miss Pulsifer the dresses made And wishes here the fact displayed That she still carries on the trade , The third door south from Bagg 's Arcade ,) A very faint “ I do ” essayed And gave her hand to Hiram Slade , From which time forth , the ghosts were laid , And ne'er gave trouble after ; But the Selectmen , be it known , Dug underneath the aforesaid stone , Where the poor peddler 's corpse was thrown , And found thereunder a jaw-bone , Though , when the crowner sat thereon , He nothing hatched , except alone Successive broods of laughter ; It was a frail and dingy thing , In which a grinder or two did cling , In color like molasses , Which surgeons , called from far and wide , Upon the horror to decide , Having put on their glasses , Reported thus — “ To judge by looks , These bones , by some queer hooks or crooks , May have belonged to Mr. Snooks , But , as men deepest-read in books Are perfectly aware , bones , If buried , fifty years or so , Lose their identity and grow From human bones to bare bones . ” Still , if to Jaalam you go down , You 'll find two parties in the town , One headed by Benaiah Brown , And one by Perez Tinkham ; The first believe the ghosts all through And vow that they shall never rue The happy chance by which they knew That people in Jupiter are blue , And very fond of Irish stew , Two curious facts which Prince Lee Boo Rapped clearly to a chosen few — Whereas the others think ‘ em A trick got up by Doctor Slade With Deborah the chamber-maid And that sly cretur Jinny , That all the revelations wise , At which the Brownites made big eyes , Might have been given by Jared Keyes , A natural fool and ninny , And , last week , did n't Eliab Snooks Come back with never better looks , As sharp as new-bought mackerel hooks , And bright as a new pin , eh ? Good Parson Wilbur , too , avers ( Though to be mixed in parish stirs Is worse than handling chestnut-burs ) That no case to his mind occurs Where spirits ever did converse Save in a kind of guttural Erse . ( So say the best authorities ;) And that a charge by raps conveyed , Should be most scrupulously weighed And searched into , before it is Made public , since it may give pain That cannot soon be cured again , And one word may infix a stain Which ten cannot gloss over , Though speaking for his private part , He is rejoiced with all his heart Miss Knott missed not her lover . AN ORIENTAL APOLOGUE . I . Somewhere in India , upon a time , ( Read it not Injah , or you spoil the verse ) There dwelt two saints whose privilege sublime It was to sit and watch the world grow worse , Their only care ( in that delicious clime ) At proper intervals to pray and curse ; Pracrit the dialect each prudent brother Used for himself , Damnonian for the other . II . One half the time of each was spent in praying For blessings on his own unworthy head , The other half in fearfully portraying Where certain folks would go when they were dead ; This system of exchanges — there 's no saying To what more solid barter ‘ twould have led , But that a river , vext with boils and swellings At rainy times , kept peace between their dwellings , III . So they two played at wordy battledore And kept a curse forever in the air , Flying this way or that from shore to shore ; No other labor did this holy pair , Clothed and supported from the lavish store Which crowds lanigerous brought with daily care ; They toiled not neither did they spin ; their bias Was tow'rd the harder task of being pious . IV . Each from his hut rushed six score times a day , Like a great canon of the Church full-rammed With cartridge theologic , ( so to say ,) Touched himself off , and then , recoiling , slammed His hovel 's door behind him in a way That to his foe said plainly — you 'll be damned ; And so like Potts and Wainwright , shrill and strong The two D — D 'd each other all day long . V. One was a dancing Dervise , a Mohammedan , The other was a Hindoo , a gymnosophist ; One kept his whatd'yecallit and his Ramadan , Laughing to scorn the sacred rites and laws of his Transfluvial rival , who , in turn , called Ahmed an Old top , and , as a clincher , shook across a fist With nails six inches long , yet lifted not His eyes from off his navel 's mystic knot . VI . “ Who whirls not round six thousand times an hour Will go , ” screamed Ahmed , “ to the evil place ; May he eat dirt , and may the dog and Giaour Defile the graves of him and all his race ; Allah loves faithful souls and gives them power To spin till they are purple in the face ; Some folks get you know what , but he that pure is Earns Paradise and ninety thousand houries . ” VII . “ Upon the silver mountain , South by East , Sits Brahma fed upon the sacred bean ; He loves those men whose nails are still increased , Who all their lives keep ugly , foul and lean ; ‘ Tis of his grace that not a bird or beast Adorned with claws like mine was ever seen ; The suns and stars are Brahma 's thoughts divine Even as these trees I seem to see are mine . ” VIII . “ Thou seem'st to see , indeed ! ” roared Ahmed back . “ Were I but once across this plaguy stream , With a stout sapling in my hand , one whack On those lank ribs would rid thee of that Dream ! Thy Brahma-blasphemy is ipecac To my soul 's stomach ; could'st thou grasp the scheme Of true redemption , thou would'st know that Deity Whirls by a kind of blessed spontaneity . IX . “ And this it is which keeps our earth here going With all the stars . ” — “ O , vile ! but there 's a place Prepared for such ; to think of Brahma throwing Worlds like a juggler 's balls up into Space ! Why , not so much as a smooth lotos blowing Is e'er allowed that silence to efface Which broods around Brahma , and our earth , ‘ tis known , Rests on a tortoise , moveless as this stone . ” X . So they kept up their banning amebean , When suddenly came floating down the stream A youth whose face like an incarnate paean Glowed , ‘ twas so full of grandeur and of gleam ; “ If there be gods , then , doubtless , this must be one . ” Thought both at once , and then began to scream , “ Surely , whate'er immortals know , thou knowest , Decide between us twain before thou goest ! ” XI . The youth was drifting in a slim canoe Most like a huge white waterlily 's petal , But neither of our theologians knew Whereof ‘ twas made ; whether of heavenly metal Unknown , or of a vast pearl split in two And hollowed , was a point they could not settle ; ‘ Twas good debate-seed , though , and bore large fruit In after years of many a tart dispute . XII . There were no wings upon the stranger 's shoulders And yet he seemed so capable of rising That , had he soared like thistledown , beholders Had thought the circumstance noways surprising ; Enough that he remained , and , when the scolders Hailed him as umpire in their vocal prize-ring , The painter of his boat he lightly threw Around a lotos-stem , and brought her to . XIII . The strange youth had a look as if he might Have trod far planets where the atmosphere , ( Of nobler temper ) steeps the face with light , Just as our skins are tanned and freckled here ; His air was that of a cosmopolite In the wide universe from sphere to sphere ; Perhaps he was ( his face had such grave beauty ) An officer of Saturn 's guards off duty . XIV . Both saints began to unfold their tales at once , Both wished their tales , like simial ones , prehensile , That they might seize his ear ; fool ! knave ! and dunce ! Flew zigzag back and forth , like strokes of pencil In a child 's fingers ; voluble as duns , They jabbered like the stones on that immense hill In the Arabian Nights ; until the stranger Began to think his ear-drum in some danger . XV . In general those who nothing have to say Contrive to spend the longest time in doing it ; They turn and vary it in every way , Hashing it , stewing it , mincing it , ragouting it ; Sometimes they keep it purposely at bay , Then let it slip to be again pursuing it ; They drone it , groan it , whisper it and shout it , Refute it , flout it , swear to't , prove it , doubt it . XVI . Our saints had practised for some thirty years ; Their talk , beginning with a single stem , Spread like a banyan , sending down live piers , Colonies of digression , and , in them , Germs of yet new migrations ; once by the ears , They could convey damnation in a hem , And blow the pitch of premise-priming off Long syllogistic batteries , with a cough . XVII . Each had a theory that the human ear A providential tunnel was , which led To a huge vacuum , ( and surely here They showed some knowledge of the general head ,) For cant to be decanted through , a mere Auricular canal or raceway to be fed All day and night , in sunshine and in shower , From their vast heads of milk-and-water-power . XVIII . The present being a peculiar case , Each with unwonted zeal the other scouted , Put his spurred hobby through its very pace , Pished , pshawed , poohed , horribled , bahed , jeered , sneered , flouted , Sniffed , nonsensed , infideled , fudged , with his face Looked scorn too nicely shaded , to be shouted , And , with each inch of person and of vesture , Contrived to hint some most disdainful gesture . XIX . At length , when their breath 's end was come about , And both could , now and then , just gasp “ impostor ! ” Holding their heads thrust menacingly out , As staggering cocks keep up their fighting posture , The stranger smiled and said , “ Beyond a doubt ‘ Tis fortunate , my friends , that you have lost your United parts of speech , or it had been Impossible for me to get between . XX . “ Produce ! says Nature ,— what have you produced ? A new straitwaistcoat for the human mind ; Are you not limbed , nerved , jointed , arteried , juiced As other men ? yet , faithless to your kind , Rather like noxious insects you are used To puncture life 's fair fruit , beneath the rind Laying your creed-eggs whence in time there spring Consumers new to eat and buzz and sting . XXI . “ Work ! you have no conception how ‘ twill sweeten Your views of Life and Nature , God and Man ; Had you been forced to earn what you have eaten , Your heaven had shown a less dyspeptic plan ; At present your whole function is to eat ten And talk ten times as rapidly as you can ; Were your shape true to cosmogonic laws , You would be nothing but a pair of jaws . XXII . “ Of all the useless beings in creation The earth could spare most easily you bakers Of little clay gods , formed in shape and fashion Precisely in the image of their makers ; Why , it would almost move a saint to passion , To see these blind and deaf , the hourly breakers Of God 's own image in their brother men , Set themselves up to tell the how , where , when , XXIII . “ Of God 's existence ; one 's digestion 's worse — So makes a god of vengeance and of blood ; Another — but no matter , they reverse Creation 's plan , out of their own vile mud Pat up a god , and burn , drown , hang , or curse Whoever worships not ; each keeps his stud Of texts which wait with saddle on and bridle To hunt down atheists to their ugly idol . XXIV . “ This , I perceive , has been your occupation ; You should have been more usefully employed ; All men are bound to earn their daily ration , Where States make not that primal contract void By cramps and limits ; simple devastation Is the worm 's task , and what he has destroyed His monument ; creating is man 's work And that , too , something more than mist and murk . ” XXV . So having said , the youth was seen no more , And straightway our sage Brahmin , the philosopher , Cried , “ That was aimed at thee , thou endless bore , Idle and useless as the growth of moss over A rotting tree-trunk ! ” “ I would square that score Full soon , ” replied the Dervise , “ could I cross over And catch thee by the beard ! Thy nails I 'd trim And make thee work , as was advised by him . ” XXVI . “ Work ? Am I not at work from morn till night Sounding the deeps of oracles umbilical Which for man 's guidance never come to light , With all their various aptitudes , until I call ? ” “ And I , do I not twirl from left to right For conscience ’ sake ? Is that no work ? Thou silly gull , He had thee in his eye ; ‘ twas Gabriel Sent to reward my faith , I know him well . ” XXVII . “ ‘ Twas Vishnu , thou vile whirligig ! ” and so The good old quarrel was begun anew ; One would have sworn the sky was black as sloe , Had but the other darned to call it blue ; Nor were the followers who fed them slow To treat each other with their curses , too , Each hating t'other ( moves it tears or laughter ? ) Because he thought him sure of hell hereafter . XXVIII . At last some genius built a bridge of boats Over the stream , and Ahmed 's zealots filed Across , upon a mission to ( cut throats And ) spread religion pure and undefiled ; They sowed the propagandist 's wildest oats , Cutting off all , down to the smallest child , And came back , giving thanks for such fat mercies , To find their harvest gone past prayers or curses . XXIX . All gone except their saint 's religious hops , Which he kept up with more than common flourish ; But these , however satisfying crops For the inner man , were not enough to nourish The body politic , which quickly drops Reserve in such sad juncture , and turns currish ; So Ahmed soon got cursed for all the famine Where'er the popular voice could edge a damn in . XXX . At first he pledged a miracle quite boldly , And , for a day or two , they growled and waited : But , finding that this kind of manna coldly Sat on their stomachs , they ere long berated The saint for still persisting in that old lie , Till soon the whole machine of saintship grated , Ran slow , creaked , stopped , and , wishing him in Tophet , They gathered strength enough to stone the prophet . XXXI . Some stronger ones contrived , ( by eating leather , Their weaker friends , and one thing or another ,) The winter months of scarcity to weather ; Among these was the late saint 's younger brother , Who , in the spring , collecting them together , Persuaded them that Ahmed 's holy pother Had wrought in their behalf , and that the place Of Saint should be continued to his race . XXXII . Accordingly ‘ twas settled on the spot That Allah favored that peculiar breed ; Beside , as all were satisfied , ‘ twould not Be quite respectable to have the need Of public spiritual food forgot ; And so the tribe , with proper forms decreed That he , and , failing him , his next of kin , Forever for the people 's good should spin .</p>
