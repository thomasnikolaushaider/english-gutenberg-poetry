     <item>I . An empty sky , a world of heather , Purple of foxglove , yellow of broom ; We two among them wading together , Shaking out honey , treading perfume . Crowds of bees are giddy with clover , Crowds of grasshoppers skip at our feet , Crowds of larks at their matins hang over , Thanking the Lord for a life so sweet . Flusheth the rise with her purple favor , Gloweth the cleft with her golden ring , ‘ Twixt the two brown butterflies waver , Lightly settle , and sleepily swing . We two walk till the purple dieth And short dry grass under foot is brown . But one little streak at a distance lieth Green like a ribbon to prank the down .</item>
     <item>II . Over the grass we stepped unto it , And God He knoweth how blithe we were ! Never a voice to bid us eschew it : Hey the green ribbon that showed so fair ! Hey the green ribbon ! we kneeled beside it , We parted the grasses dewy and sheen ; Drop over drop there filtered and slided A tiny bright beck that trickled between . Tinkle , tinkle , sweetly it sang to us , Light was our talk as of faëry bells — Faëry wedding-bells faintly rung to us Down in their fortunate parallels . Hand in hand , while the sun peered over , We lapped the grass on that youngling spring ; Swept back its rushes , smoothed its clover , And said , “ Let us follow it westering . ”</item>
     <item>III . A dappled sky , a world of meadows , Circling above us the black rooks fly Forward , backward ; lo , their dark shadows Flit on the blossoming tapestry — Flit on the beck , for her long grass parteth As hair from a maid 's bright eyes blown back ; And , lo , the sun like a lover darteth His flattering smile on her wayward track . Sing on ! we sing in the glorious weather Till one steps over the tiny strand , So narrow , in sooth , that still together On either brink we go hand in hand . The beck grows wider , the hands must sever . On either margin , our songs all done , We move apart , while she singeth ever , Taking the course of the stooping sun . He prays , “ Come over ” — I may not follow ; I cry , “ Return ” — but he cannot come : We speak , we laugh , but with voices hollow ; Our hands are hanging , our hearts are numb .</item>
     <item>IV . A breathing sigh , a sigh for answer , A little talking of outward things The careless beck is a merry dancer , Keeping sweet time to the air she sings . A little pain when the beck grows wider ; “ Cross to me now — for her wavelets swell . ” “ I may not cross , ” — and the voice beside her Faintly reacheth , though heeded well . No backward path ; ah ! no returning ; No second crossing that ripple 's flow : “ Come to me now , for the west is burning ; Come ere it darkens ; ” — “ Ah , no ! ah , no ! ” Then cries of pain , and arms outreaching — The beck grows wider and swift and deep : Passionate words as of one beseeching — The loud beck drowns them ; we walk , and weep .</item>
     <item>V. A yellow moon in splendor drooping , A tired queen with her state oppressed , Low by rushes and swordgrass stooping , Lies she soft on the waves at rest . The desert heavens have felt her sadness ; Her earth will weep her some dewy tears ; The wild beck ends her tune of gladness , And goeth stilly as soul that fears . We two walk on in our grassy places On either marge of the moonlit flood , With the moon 's own sadness in our faces , Where joy is withered , blossom and bud .</item>
     <item>VI . A shady freshness , chafers whirring , A little piping of leaf-hid birds ; A flutter of wings , a fitful stirring , A cloud to the eastward snowy as curds . Bare grassy slopes , where kids are tethered Round valleys like nests all ferny-lined ; Round hills , with fluttering tree-tops feathered , Swell high in their freckled robes behind . A rose-flush tender , a thrill , a quiver , When golden gleams to the tree-tops glide ; A flashing edge for the milk-white river , The beck , a river — with still sleek tide . Broad and white , and polished as silver , On she goes under fruit-laden trees ; Sunk in leafage cooeth the culver , And ‘ plaineth of love 's disloyalties . Glitters the dew and shines the river , Up comes the lily and dries her bell ; But two are walking apart forever , And wave their hands for a mute farewell .</item>
     <item>VII . A braver swell , a swifter sliding ; The river hasteth , her banks recede : Wing-like sails on her bosom gliding Bear down the lily and drown the reed . Stately prows are rising and bowing ( Shouts of mariners winnow the air ) , And level sands for banks endowing The tiny green ribbon that showed so fair . While , O my heart ! as white sails shiver , And crowds are passing , and banks stretch wide How hard to follow , with lips that quiver , That moving speck on the far-off side ! Farther , farther — I see it — know it — My eyes brim over , it melts away : Only my heart to my heart shall show it As I walk desolate day by day .</item>
     <item>VII . And yet I know past all doubting , truly — A knowledge greater than grief can dim — I know , as he loved , he will love me duly — Yea better — e'en better than I love him . And as I walk by the vast calm river , The awful river so dread to see , I say , “ Thy breadth and thy depth forever Are bridged by his thoughts that cross to me . ”</item>

       <l n="113">And the gracious echoes woke</l>
       <l n="114">By man 's work : the woodman 's stroke ,</l>
       <l n="115">Shout of shepherd , whistlings blithe .</l>

       <l n="122">And my pulse no longer beat ,</l>
       <l n="123">Keeping time and bearing part</l>

     <p>“ So ; swing open door , and shade Take me ; I am not afraid , For the time will not be long ; Soon I shall have waxen strong — Strong enough my own to win From the grave it lies within . ” And I entered . On her bier Quiet lay the buried year ; I sat down where I could see Life without and sunshine free , Death within . And I between , Waited my own heart to wean From the shroud that shaded her In the rock-hewn sepulchre — Waited till the dead should say , “ Heart , be free of me this day ” — Waited with a patient will — AND I WAIT BETWEEN THEM STILL .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">I take the year back to my life and story ,</l>
       <l n="2">The dead year , and say , “ I will share in thy tomb .</l>

        <l n="149">Merely for keeping him in breath , and wake</l>
        <l n="150">Only to ride to cover . ”</l>
        <l n="151">Not the less</l>
        <l n="152">The grandsire pondered . “ Ay , the boy must WORK</l>
        <l n="153">Or SPEND ; and I must let him spend ; just stay</l>
        <l n="154">Awhile with us , and then from time to time</l>
        <l n="155">Have leave to be away with those fine folk</l>
        <l n="156">With whom , these many years , at school , and now ,</l>
        <l n="157">During his sojourn in the foreign towns ,</l>
        <l n="158">He has been made familiar . ” Thus a month</l>
        <l n="159">Went by . They liked the stirring ways of youth ,</l>
        <l n="160">The quick elastic step , and joyous mind ,</l>
        <l n="161">Ever expectant of it knew not what ,</l>
        <l n="162">But something higher than has e'er been born</l>
        <l n="163">Of easy slumber and sweet competence .</l>
        <l n="164">And as for him ,— the while they thought and thought</l>
        <l n="165">A comfortable instinct let him know</l>
        <l n="166">How they had waited for him , to complete</l>
        <l n="167">And give a meaning to their lives ; and still</l>
        <l n="168">At home , but with a sense of newness there ,</l>
        <l n="169">And frank and fresh as in the school-boy days ,</l>
        <l n="170">He oft — invading of his father 's haunts ,</l>
        <l n="171">The study where he passed the silent morn —</l>
        <l n="172">Would sit , devouring with a greedy joy</l>
        <l n="173">The piled-up books , uncut as yet ; or wake</l>
        <l n="174">To guide with him by night the tube , and search ,</l>
        <l n="175">Ay , think to find new stars ; then risen betimes ,</l>
        <l n="176">Would ride about the farm , and list the talk</l>

        <l n="178">But a day came round ,</l>
        <l n="179">When , after peering in his mother 's room ,</l>
        <l n="180">Shaded and shuttered from the light , he oped</l>
        <l n="181">A door , and found the rosy grandmother</l>
        <l n="182">Ensconced and happy in her special pride ,</l>
        <l n="183">Her storeroom . She was corking syrups rare ,</l>
        <l n="184">And fruits all sparkling in a crystal coat .</l>
        <l n="185">Here after choice of certain cates well known ,</l>
        <l n="186">He , sitting on her bacon-chest at ease ,</l>
        <l n="187">Sang as he watched her , till right suddenly ,</l>
        <l n="188">As if a new thought came , “ Goody , ” quoth he ,</l>
        <l n="189">“ What , think you , do they want to do with me ?</l>
        <l n="190">What have they planned for me that I should do ? ”</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="12">

        <l n="193">Why would ye go away ? There is no need</l>

        <l n="195">Have we not plenty ? ”</l>
        <l n="196">“ Even so , ” he said ;</l>

        <l n="198">“ Nay , then , ” quoth she ,</l>
        <l n="199">“ Be idle ; let me see your blessed face .</l>
        <l n="200">What , is the horse your father chose for you</l>
        <l n="201">Not to your mind ? He is ? Well , well , remain ;</l>

        <l n="207">“ What , then , ”</l>
        <l n="208">She sighed , “ what is it , child , that you would like ? ”</l>
        <l n="209">“ Why , ” said he , “ farming . ”</l>
        <l n="210">And she looked at him ,</l>

        <l n="212">Some fitness in the worker for the work ,</l>
        <l n="213">And she found none . A certain grace there was</l>
        <l n="214">Of movement , and a beauty in the face ,</l>
        <l n="215">Sun-browned and healthful beauty that had come</l>
        <l n="216">From his grave father ; and she thought , “ Good lack ,</l>
        <l n="217">A farmer ! he is fitter for a duke .</l>
        <l n="218">He walks ; why , how he walks ! if I should meet</l>
        <l n="219">One like him , whom I knew not , I should ask ,</l>
        <l n="220">‘ And who may that be ? ’ ” So the foolish thought</l>

        <l n="223">And with engaging sweet audacity</l>
        <l n="224">She thought it nothing less ,— he , looking up ,</l>
        <l n="225">With a smile in his blue eyes , replied to her ,</l>
        <l n="226">“ And hav'n ' t you done it ? ” Quoth she , lovingly ,</l>

        <l n="230">To help me in it , and to let me farm ;</l>

        <l n="382">Himself in thought away , and made his ears</l>
        <l n="383">Hearken , and caused his voice , that yet did seem</l>

        <l n="404">As thinking on that other , unaware</l>

        <l n="410">He set his teeth to force the unbearable</l>
        <l n="411">Misery back , his wide-awakened eyes</l>

        <l n="415">And trembled at the deep she could not sound ;</l>
        <l n="416">A passionate nature in a storm ; a heart</l>
        <l n="417">Wild with a mortal pain , and in the grasp</l>
        <l n="418">Of an immortal love .</l>
        <l n="419">“ Farewell , ” he said ,</l>

        <l n="426">Because there leaped from under his straight lids ,</l>
        <l n="427">And instantly was veiled , a keen surprise ,—</l>

        <l n="431">Or at the church , she ever bore herself</l>
        <l n="432">Proudly , for she had felt a certain pain ,</l>
        <l n="433">The disapproval hastily betrayed</l>
        <l n="434">And quickly hidden hurt her . “ ‘ T was a grace , ”</l>

        <l n="444">Their loveliness reach down into her heart ,</l>
        <l n="445">And knew with them the ecstasies of growth ,</l>
        <l n="446">The rapture that was satisfied with light ,</l>
        <l n="447">The pleasure of the leaf in exquisite</l>

        <l n="459">He loved her , but his peace and welfare made</l>
        <l n="460">The sunshine of three lives . The cheerful grange</l>
        <l n="461">Threw open wide its hospitable doors</l>
        <l n="462">And drew in guests for him . The garden flowers ,</l>
        <l n="463">Sweet budding wonders , all were set for him .</l>
        <l n="464">In him the eyes at home were satisfied ,</l>
        <l n="465">And if he did but laugh the ear approved .</l>
        <l n="466">What then ? He dwelt among them as of old ,</l>
        <l n="467">And taught his mouth to smile .</l>
        <l n="468">And time went on ,</l>
        <l n="469">Till on a morning , when the perfect spring</l>
        <l n="470">Rested among her leaves , he journeying home</l>
        <l n="471">After short sojourn in a neighboring town ,</l>
        <l n="472">Stopped at the little station on the line</l>
        <l n="473">That ran between his woods ; a lonely place</l>
        <l n="474">And quiet , and a woman and a child</l>
        <l n="475">Got out . He noted them , but walking on</l>
        <l n="476">Quickly , went back into the wood , impelled</l>
        <l n="477">By hope , for , passing , he had seen his love ,</l>
        <l n="478">And she was sitting on a rustic seat</l>
        <l n="479">That overlooked the line , and he desired</l>
        <l n="480">With longing indescribable to look</l>
        <l n="481">Upon her face again . And he drew near .</l>
        <l n="482">She was right happy ; she was waiting there .</l>
        <l n="483">He felt that she was waiting for her lord .</l>
        <l n="484">She cared no whit if Laurance went or stayed ,</l>
        <l n="485">But answered when he spoke , and dropped her cheek</l>
        <l n="486">In her fair hand .</l>
        <l n="487">And he , not able yet</l>
        <l n="488">To force himself away , and never more</l>
        <l n="489">Behold her , gathered blossom , primrose flowers ,</l>
        <l n="490">And wild anemone , for many a clump</l>
        <l n="491">Grew all about him , and the hazel rods</l>
        <l n="492">Were nodding with their catkins . But he heard</l>
        <l n="493">The stopping train , and felt that he must go ;</l>
        <l n="494">His time was come . There was nought else to do</l>
        <l n="495">Or hope for . With the blossom he drew near</l>
        <l n="496">And would have had her take it from his hand ;</l>
        <l n="497">But she , half lost in thought , held out her own ,</l>
        <l n="498">And then remembering him and his long love ,</l>
        <l n="499">She said , “ I thank you ; pray you now forget ,</l>
        <l n="500">Forget me , Laurance , ” and her lovely eyes</l>
        <l n="501">Softened ; but he was dumb , till through the trees</l>
        <l n="502">Suddenly broke upon their quietude</l>
        <l n="503">The woman and her child . And Muriel said ,</l>
        <l n="504">“ What will you ? ” She made answer quick and keen ,</l>
        <l n="505">“ Your name , my lady ; ‘ tis your name I want ,</l>
        <l n="506">Tell me your name . ” Not startled , not displeased ,</l>
        <l n="507">But with a musing sweetness on her mouth ,</l>
        <l n="508">As if considering in how short a while</l>
        <l n="509">It would be changed , she lifted up her face</l>
        <l n="510">And gave it , and the little child drew near</l>
        <l n="511">And pulled her gown , and prayed her for the flowers .</l>
        <l n="512">Then Laurance , not content to leave them so ,</l>
        <l n="513">Nor yet to wait the coming lover , spoke ,—</l>
        <l n="514">“ Your errand with this lady ? ” — “ And your right</l>
        <l n="515">To ask it ? ” she broke out with sudden heat</l>
        <l n="516">And passion : “ What is that to you ! Poor child !</l>
        <l n="517">Madam ! ” And Muriel lifted up her face</l>
        <l n="518">And looked ,— they looked into each other 's eyes .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="22">
        <l n="519">“ That man who comes , ” the clear-voiced woman cried ,</l>
        <l n="520">“ That man with whom you think to wed so soon ,</l>
        <l n="521">You must not heed him . What ! the world is full</l>
        <l n="522">Of men , and some are good , and most , God knows ,</l>
        <l n="523">Better than he ,— that I should say it !— far</l>
        <l n="524">Better . ” And down her face the large tears ran ,</l>
        <l n="525">And Muriel 's wild dilated eyes looked up ,</l>
        <l n="526">Taking a terrible meaning from her words ;</l>
        <l n="527">And Laurance stared about him half in doubt</l>
        <l n="528">If this were real , for all things were so blithe ,</l>
        <l n="529">And soft air tossed the little flowers about ;</l>
        <l n="530">The child was singing , and the blackbirds piped ,</l>
        <l n="531">Glad in fair sunshine . And the women both</l>
        <l n="532">Were quiet , gazing in each other 's eyes .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="23">
        <l n="533">He found his voice , and spoke : “ This is not well ,</l>
        <l n="534">Though whom you speak of should have done you wrong ;</l>
        <l n="535">A man that could desert and plan to wed</l>
        <l n="536">Will not his purpose yield to God and right ,</l>
        <l n="537">Only to law . You , whom I pity so much ,</l>
        <l n="538">If you be come this day to urge a claim ,</l>
        <l n="539">You will not tell me that your claim will hold ;</l>
        <l n="540">‘ Tis only , if I read aright , the old ,</l>
        <l n="541">Sorrowful , hateful story ! ”</l>
        <l n="542">Muriel sighed ,</l>
        <l n="543">With a dull patience that he marvelled at ,</l>
        <l n="544">“ Be plain with me . I know not what to think ,</l>
        <l n="545">Unless you are his wife . Are you his wife ?</l>
        <l n="546">Be plain with me . ” And all too quietly ,</l>
        <l n="547">With running down of tears , the answer came ,</l>
        <l n="548">“ Ay , madam , ay ! the worse for him and me . ”</l>
        <l n="549">Then Muriel heard her lover 's foot anear ,</l>
        <l n="550">And cried upon him with a bitter cry ,</l>
        <l n="551">Sharp and despairing . And those two stood back ,</l>
        <l n="552">With such affright , and violent anger stirred</l>
        <l n="553">He broke from out the thicket to her side ,</l>
        <l n="554">Not knowing . But , her hands before her face ,</l>
        <l n="555">She sat ; and , stepping close , that woman came</l>
        <l n="556">And faced him . Then said Muriel , “ O my heart ,</l>
        <l n="557">Herbert ! ” — and he was dumb , and ground his teeth ,</l>
        <l n="558">And lifted up his hand and looked at it ,</l>
        <l n="559">And at the woman ; but a man was there</l>
        <l n="560">Who whirled her from her place , and thrust himself</l>
        <l n="561">Between them ; he was strong ,— a stalwart man :</l>
        <l n="562">And Herbert thinking on it , knew his name .</l>
        <l n="563">“ What good , ” quoth he , “ though you and I should strive</l>
        <l n="564">And wrestle all this April day ? A word ,</l>
        <l n="565">And not a blow , is what these women want :</l>
        <l n="566">Master yourself , and say it . ” But he , weak</l>
        <l n="567">With passion and great anguish , flung himself</l>
        <l n="568">Upon the seat and cried , “ O lost , my love !</l>
        <l n="569">O Muriel , Muriel ! ” And the woman spoke ,</l>
        <l n="570">“ Sir , ‘ twas an evil day you wed with me ;</l>
        <l n="571">And you were young ; I know it , sir , right well .</l>
        <l n="572">Sir , I have worked ; I have not troubled you ,</l>
        <l n="573">Not for myself , nor for your child . I know</l>
        <l n="574">We are not equal . ” “ Hold ! ” he cried ; “ have done ;</l>
        <l n="575">Your still , tame words are worse than hate or scorn .</l>
        <l n="576">Get from me ! Ay , my wife , my wife , indeed !</l>
        <l n="577">All 's done . You hear it , Muriel ; if you can ,</l>
        <l n="578">O sweet , forgive me . ”</l>
        <l n="579">Then the woman moved</l>
        <l n="580">Slowly away : her little singing child</l>
        <l n="581">Went in her wake : and Muriel dropped her hands ,</l>
        <l n="582">And sat before these two that loved her so ,</l>
        <l n="583">Mute and unheeding . There were angry words ,</l>
        <l n="584">She knew , but yet she could not hear the words ;</l>
        <l n="585">And afterwards the man she loved stooped down</l>
        <l n="586">And kissed her forehead once , and then withdrew</l>
        <l n="587">To look at her , and with a gesture pray</l>
        <l n="588">Her pardon . And she tried to speak , but failed ,</l>
        <l n="589">And presently , and soon , O ,— he was gone .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="24">
        <l n="590">She heard him go , and Laurance , still as stone ,</l>

        <l n="592">Before her face again , and afterward</l>
        <l n="593">She heard a voice , as if a long way off ,</l>
        <l n="594">Some one entreated , but she could not heed .</l>
        <l n="595">Thereon he drew her hand away , and raised</l>

        <l n="597">That he would have her go with him , go home ,—</l>
        <l n="598">It was not far to go ,— a dreary home .</l>
        <l n="599">A crippled aunt , of birth and lineage high ,</l>

        <l n="607">As he had seen it . After , he retired :</l>
        <l n="608">And restless , and not master of himself ,</l>
        <l n="609">He day and night haunted the rectory lanes ;</l>
        <l n="610">And all things , even to the spreading out</l>
        <l n="611">Of leaves , their flickering shadows on the ground ,</l>
        <l n="612">Or sailing of the slow , white cloud , or peace</l>
        <l n="613">And glory and great light on mountain heads ,—</l>

        <l n="627">Subdued by her sweet patience and his pain ,</l>

      <head>AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">O happy Gladys ! I rejoice with her ,</l>
       <l n="2">For Gladys saw the island .</l>
       <l n="3">It was thus :</l>
       <l n="4">They gave a day for pleasure in the school</l>
       <l n="5">Where Gladys taught ; and all the other girls</l>
       <l n="6">Were taken out , to picnic in a wood .</l>
       <l n="7">But it was said , “ We think it were not well</l>
       <l n="8">That little Gladys should acquire a taste</l>
       <l n="9">For pleasure , going about , and needless change .</l>
       <l n="10">It would not suit her station : discontent</l>
       <l n="11">Might come of it ; and all her duties now</l>
       <l n="12">She does so pleasantly , that we were best</l>
       <l n="13">To keep her humble . ” So they said to her ,</l>
       <l n="14">“ Gladys , we shall not want you , all to-day .</l>
       <l n="15">Look , you are free ; you need not sit at work :</l>
       <l n="16">No , you may take a long and pleasant walk</l>
       <l n="17">Over the sea-cliff , or upon the beach</l>
       <l n="18">Among the visitors . ”</l>
       <l n="19">Then Gladys blushed</l>
       <l n="20">For joy , and thanked them . What ! a holiday ,</l>
       <l n="21">A whole one , for herself ! How good , how kind !</l>
       <l n="22">With that , the marshalled carriages drove off ;</l>
       <l n="23">And Gladys , sobered with her weight of joy ,</l>
       <l n="24">Stole out beyond the groups upon the beach —</l>
       <l n="25">The children with their wooden spades , the band</l>
       <l n="26">That played for lovers , and the sunny stir</l>
       <l n="27">Of cheerful life and leisure — to the rocks ,</l>
       <l n="28">For these she wanted most , and there was time</l>
       <l n="29">To mark them ; how like ruined organs prone</l>
       <l n="30">They lay , or leaned their giant fluted pipes ,</l>
       <l n="31">And let the great white-crested reckless wave</l>
       <l n="32">Beat out their booming melody .</l>
       <l n="33">The sea</l>
       <l n="34">Was filled with light ; in clear blue caverns curled</l>
       <l n="35">The breakers , and they ran , and seemed to romp ,</l>
       <l n="36">As playing at some rough and dangerous game ,</l>
       <l n="37">While all the nearer waves rushed in to help ,</l>
       <l n="38">And all the farther heaved their heads to peep ,</l>
       <l n="39">And tossed the fishing boats . Then Gladys laughed ,</l>
       <l n="40">And said , “ O , happy tide , to be so lost</l>
       <l n="41">In sunshine , that one dare not look at it ;</l>
       <l n="42">And lucky cliffs , to be so brown and warm ;</l>
       <l n="43">And yet how lucky are the shadows , too ,</l>
       <l n="44">That lurk beneath their ledges . It is strange ,</l>
       <l n="45">That in remembrance though I lay them up ,</l>
       <l n="46">They are forever , when I come to them ,</l>
       <l n="47">Better than I had thought . O , something yet</l>
       <l n="48">I had forgotten . Oft I say , ‘ At least</l>
       <l n="49">This picture is imprinted ; thus and thus ,</l>
       <l n="50">The sharpened serried jags run up , run out ,</l>
       <l n="51">Layer on layer . ’ And I look — up — up —</l>
       <l n="52">High , higher up again , till far aloft</l>
       <l n="53">They cut into their ether ,— brown , and clear ,</l>
       <l n="54">And perfect . And I , saying , ‘ This is mine ,</l>
       <l n="55">To keep , ’ retire ; but shortly come again ,</l>
       <l n="56">And they confound me with a glorious change .</l>
       <l n="57">The low sun out of rain-clouds stares at them ;</l>
       <l n="58">They redden , and their edges drip with — what ?</l>
       <l n="59">I know not , but ‘ t is red . It leaves no stain ,</l>
       <l n="60">For the next morning they stand up like ghosts</l>
       <l n="61">In a sea-shroud and fifty thousand mews</l>
       <l n="62">Sit there , in long white files , and chatter on ,</l>
       <l n="63">Like silly school-girls in their silliest mood .</l>

       <l n="74">And where they carry you ! ’ Ah , well , I know</l>
       <l n="75">It is a pity , ” Gladys said ; “ but then</l>
       <l n="76">We cannot all be wise : happy for me ,</l>

       <l n="81">When they are wanted !— when I teach the sums</l>
       <l n="82">On rainy days , and when the practising</l>

       <l n="89">How serious all my duties look to me .</l>

       <l n="137">She walks so fast , for I am hungry now ,</l>

       <l n="143">Unpacked her little basket , ate and drank ,</l>
       <l n="144">Then pushed her hands into the warm dry sand ,</l>
       <l n="145">And thought the earth was happy , and she too</l>
       <l n="146">Was going round with it in happiness ,</l>
       <l n="147">That holiday . “ What was it that she said ? ”</l>

       <l n="150">‘ Her greater for their less , ’ — it makes me laugh ,—</l>

       <l n="152">To look and to admire , one should not wish</l>
       <l n="153">To steal THEIR virtues , and to put them on ,</l>
       <l n="154">Like feathers from another wing ; beside ,</l>

       <l n="159">How they are reared , or some will go astray</l>
       <l n="160">And shame their mother . Cain and Abel both</l>
       <l n="161">Were only once removed from innocence .</l>
       <l n="162">Why did I envy them ? That was not good ;</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="164">But as she spake , lo , Gladys raised her eyes ,</l>
       <l n="165">And right before her , on the horizon 's edge ,</l>
       <l n="166">Behold , an island ! First , she looked away</l>
       <l n="167">Along the solid rocks and steadfast shore ,</l>
       <l n="168">For she was all amazed , believing not ,</l>
       <l n="169">And then she looked again , and there again</l>
       <l n="170">Behold , an island ! And the tide had turned ,</l>
       <l n="171">The milky sea had got a purple rim ,</l>
       <l n="172">And from the rim that mountain island rose ,</l>
       <l n="173">Purple , with two high peaks , the northern peak</l>
       <l n="174">The higher , and with fell and precipice ,</l>
       <l n="175">It ran down steeply to the water 's brink ;</l>
       <l n="176">But all the southern line was long and soft ,</l>
       <l n="177">Broken with tender curves , and , as she thought ,</l>
       <l n="178">Covered with forest or with sward . But , look !</l>
       <l n="179">The sun was on the island ; and he showed</l>
       <l n="180">On either peak a dazzling cap of snow .</l>
       <l n="181">Then Gladys held her breath ; she said , “ Indeed ,</l>
       <l n="182">Indeed it is an island : how is this ,</l>
       <l n="183">I never saw it till this fortunate</l>
       <l n="184">Rare holiday ? ” And while she strained her eyes ,</l>
       <l n="185">She thought that it began to fade ; but not</l>
       <l n="186">To change as clouds do , only to withdraw</l>
       <l n="187">And melt into its azure ; and at last ,</l>
       <l n="188">Little by little , from her hungry heart ,</l>
       <l n="189">That longed to draw things marvellous to itself ,</l>
       <l n="190">And yearned towards the riches and the great</l>
       <l n="191">Abundance of the beauty God hath made ,</l>
       <l n="192">It passed away . Tears started in her eyes ,</l>
       <l n="193">And when they dropt , the mountain isle was gone ;</l>
       <l n="194">The careless sea had quite forgotten it ,</l>
       <l n="195">And all was even as it had been before .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="196">And Gladys wept , but there was luxury</l>

       <l n="248">Who said in ancient time to the desert pool ,</l>
       <l n="249">‘ Thou shalt not wait for angel visitors</l>

       <l n="251">At home ? The lore , beloved , shall fly to us</l>
       <l n="252">On a pair of sumptuous wings . Or may we breathe</l>

       <l n="257">Full of sweet language as a lover 's mouth ,</l>

       <l n="265">Her ears being keen , the lowing and the mad</l>
       <l n="266">Masterful tramping of the bison herds ,</l>
       <l n="267">Tearing down headlong with their bloodshot eyes ,</l>
       <l n="268">In savage rifts of hair ; the crack and creak</l>
       <l n="269">Of ice-floes in the frozen sea , the cry</l>

       <l n="280">For lack of holidays . ” So Gladys thought ,</l>
       <l n="281">“ A most strange woman , and she talks of me . ”</l>
       <l n="282">With that a girl ran up ; “ Mother , ” she said ,</l>
       <l n="283">“ Come out of this brown bight , I pray you now ,</l>
       <l n="284">It smells of fairies . ” Gladys thereon thought ,</l>
       <l n="285">“ The mother will not speak to me , perhaps</l>
       <l n="286">The daughter may , ” and asked her courteously ,</l>
       <l n="287">“ What do the fairies smell of ? ” But the girl</l>
       <l n="288">With peevish pout replied , “ You know , you know . ”</l>
       <l n="289">“ Not I , ” said Gladys ; then she answered her ,</l>
       <l n="290">“ Something like buttercups . But , mother , come ,</l>
       <l n="291">And whisper up a porpoise from the foam ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="293">Full slowly , then ,</l>
       <l n="294">The mother rose , and ever kept her eyes</l>
       <l n="295">Upon her little child . “ You freakish maid , ”</l>
       <l n="296">Said she , “ now mark me , if I call you one ,</l>
       <l n="297">You shall not scold nor make him take you far . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="298">“ I only want ,— you know I only want , ”</l>
       <l n="299">The girl replied , “ to go and play awhile</l>
       <l n="300">Upon the sand by Lagos . ” Then she turned</l>
       <l n="301">And muttered low , “ Mother , is this the girl</l>
       <l n="302">Who saw the island ? ” But the mother frowned .</l>
       <l n="303">“ When may she go to it ? ” the daughter asked .</l>
       <l n="304">And Gladys , following them , gave all her mind</l>
       <l n="305">To hear the answer . “ When she wills to go ;</l>
       <l n="306">For yonder comes to shore the ferry boat . ”</l>
       <l n="307">Then Gladys turned to look , and even so</l>
       <l n="308">It was ; a ferry boat , and far away</l>
       <l n="309">Reared in the offing , lo , the purple peaks</l>
       <l n="310">Of her loved island .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="311">Then she raised her arms ,</l>
       <l n="312">And ran toward the boat , crying out , “ O rare ,</l>
       <l n="313">The island ! fair befall the island ; let</l>
       <l n="314">Me reach the island . ” And she sprang on board ,</l>
       <l n="315">And after her stepped in the freakish maid</l>
       <l n="316">And the fair mother , brooding o'er her child ;</l>
       <l n="317">And this one took the helm , and that let go</l>
       <l n="318">The sail , and off they flew , and furrowed up</l>
       <l n="319">A flaky hill before , and left behind</l>
       <l n="320">A sobbing snake-like tail of creamy foam ;</l>
       <l n="321">And dancing hither , thither , sometimes shot</l>
       <l n="322">Toward the island ; then , when Gladys looked ,</l>
       <l n="323">Were leaving it to leeward . And the maid</l>
       <l n="324">Whistled a wind to come and rock the craft ,</l>
       <l n="325">And would be leaning down her head to mew</l>
       <l n="326">At cat-fish , then lift out into her lap</l>
       <l n="327">And dandle baby-seals , which , having kissed ,</l>
       <l n="328">She flung to their sleek mothers , till her own</l>
       <l n="329">Rebuked her in good English , after cried ,</l>
       <l n="330">“ Luff , luff , we shall be swamped . ” “ I will not luff , ”</l>
       <l n="331">Sobbed the fair mischief ; “ you are cross to me . ”</l>
       <l n="332">“ For shame ! ” the mother shrieked ; “ luff , luff , my dear ;</l>
       <l n="333">Kiss and be friends , and thou shalt have the fish</l>
       <l n="334">With the curly tail to ride on . ” So she did ,</l>
       <l n="335">And presently a dolphin bouncing up ,</l>
       <l n="336">She sprang upon his slippery back ,— “ Farewell , ”</l>
       <l n="337">She laughed , was off , and all the sea grew calm .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="338">Then Gladys was much happier , and was ‘ ware</l>
       <l n="339">In the smooth weather that this woman talked</l>
       <l n="340">Like one in sleep , and murmured certain thoughts</l>
       <l n="341">Which seemed to be like echoes of her own .</l>
       <l n="342">She nodded , “ Yes , the girl is going now</l>
       <l n="343">To her own island . Gladys poor ? Not she !</l>
       <l n="344">Who thinks so ? Once I met a man in white ,</l>
       <l n="345">Who said to me , ‘ The thing that might have been</l>
       <l n="346">Is called , and questioned why it hath not been ;</l>
       <l n="347">And can it give good reason , it is set</l>
       <l n="348">Beside the actual , and reckoned in</l>
       <l n="349">To fill the empty gaps of life . ’ Ah , so</l>
       <l n="350">The possible stands by us ever fresh ,</l>
       <l n="351">Fairer than aught which any life hath owned ,</l>
       <l n="352">And makes divine amends . Now this was set</l>
       <l n="353">Apart from kin , and not ordained a home ;</l>
       <l n="354">An equal ;— and not suffered to fence in</l>
       <l n="355">A little plot of earthly good , and say ,</l>
       <l n="356">‘ Tis mine ’ ; but in bereavement of the part ,</l>
       <l n="357">O , yet to taste the whole ,— to understand</l>
       <l n="358">The grandeur of the story , not to feel</l>
       <l n="359">Satiate with good possessed , but evermore</l>
       <l n="360">A healthful hunger for the great idea ,</l>
       <l n="361">The beauty and the blessedness of life .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="17">
       <l n="362">“ Lo , now , the shadow ! ” quoth she , breaking off ,</l>
       <l n="363">“ We are in the shadow . ” Then did Gladys turn ,</l>
       <l n="364">And , O , the mountain with the purple peaks</l>
       <l n="365">Was close at hand . It cast a shadow out ,</l>
       <l n="366">And they were in it : and she saw the snow ,</l>
       <l n="367">And under that the rocks , and under that</l>
       <l n="368">The pines , and then the pasturage ; and saw</l>
       <l n="369">Numerous dips , and undulations rare ,</l>
       <l n="370">Running down seaward , all astir with lithe</l>
       <l n="371">Long canes , and lofty feathers ; for the palms</l>
       <l n="372">And spice trees of the south , nay , every growth ,</l>
       <l n="373">Meets in that island .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="18">
       <l n="374">So that woman ran</l>
       <l n="375">The boat ashore , and Gladys set her foot</l>
       <l n="376">Thereon . Then all at once much laughter rose ;</l>
       <l n="377">Invisible folk set up exultant shouts ,</l>
       <l n="378">“ It all belongs to Gladys ” ; and she ran</l>
       <l n="379">And hid herself among the nearest trees</l>
       <l n="380">And panted , shedding tears .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="19">
       <l n="381">So she looked round ,</l>
       <l n="382">And saw that she was in a banyan grove ,</l>
       <l n="383">Full of wild peacocks ,— pecking on the grass ,</l>
       <l n="384">A flickering mass of eyes , blue , green , and gold ,</l>
       <l n="385">Or reaching out their jewelled necks , where high</l>
       <l n="386">They sat in rows along the boughs . No tree</l>
       <l n="387">Cumbered with creepers let the sunshine through ,</l>
       <l n="388">But it was caught in scarlet cups , and poured</l>
       <l n="389">From these on amber tufts of bloom , and dropped</l>
       <l n="390">Lower on azure stars . The air was still ,</l>
       <l n="391">As if awaiting somewhat , or asleep ,</l>
       <l n="392">And Gladys was the only thing that moved ,</l>
       <l n="393">Excepting ,— no , they were not birds ,— what then ?</l>
       <l n="394">Glorified rainbows with a living soul ?</l>
       <l n="395">While they passed through a sunbeam they were seen ,</l>
       <l n="396">Not otherwhere , but they were present yet</l>
       <l n="397">In shade . They were at work , pomegranate fruit</l>
       <l n="398">That lay about removing ,— purple grapes ,</l>
       <l n="399">That clustered in the path , clearing aside .</l>
       <l n="400">Through a small spot of light would pass and go ,</l>
       <l n="401">The glorious happy mouth and two fair eyes</l>
       <l n="402">Of somewhat that made rustlings where it went ;</l>
       <l n="403">But when a beam would strike the ground sheer down ,</l>
       <l n="404">Behold them ! they had wings , and they would pass</l>
       <l n="405">One after other with the sheeny fans ,</l>
       <l n="406">Bearing them slowly , that their hues were seen ,</l>
       <l n="407">Tender as russet crimson dropt on snows ,</l>
       <l n="408">Or where they turned flashing with gold and dashed</l>
       <l n="409">With purple glooms . And they had feet , but these</l>
       <l n="410">Did barely touch the ground . And they took heed</l>
       <l n="411">Not to disturb the waiting quietness ;</l>
       <l n="412">Nor rouse up fawns , that slept beside their dams ;</l>
       <l n="413">Nor the fair leopard , with her sleek paws laid</l>
       <l n="414">Across her little drowsy cubs ; nor swans ,</l>
       <l n="415">That , floating , slept upon a glassy pool ;</l>
       <l n="416">Nor rosy cranes , all slumbering in the reeds ,</l>
       <l n="417">With heads beneath their wings . For this , you know ,</l>
       <l n="418">Was Eden . She was passing through the trees</l>
       <l n="419">That made a ring about it , and she caught</l>
       <l n="420">A glimpse of glades beyond . All she had seen</l>
       <l n="421">Was nothing to them ; but words are not made</l>
       <l n="422">To tell that tale . No wind was let to blow ,</l>
       <l n="423">And all the doves were bidden to hold their peace .</l>
       <l n="424">Why ? One was working in a valley near ,</l>
       <l n="425">And none might look that way . It was understood</l>
       <l n="426">That He had nearly ended that His work ;</l>
       <l n="427">For two shapes met , and one to other spake ,</l>
       <l n="428">Accosting him with , “ Prince , what worketh He ? ”</l>
       <l n="429">Who whispered , “ Lo ! He fashioneth red clay . ”</l>
       <l n="430">And all at once a little trembling stir</l>
       <l n="431">Was felt in the earth , and every creature woke ,</l>
       <l n="432">And laid its head down , listening . It was known</l>
       <l n="433">Then that the work was done ; the new-made king</l>
       <l n="434">Had risen , and set his feet upon his realm ,</l>
       <l n="435">And it acknowledged him .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="20">
       <l n="436">But in her path</l>
       <l n="437">Came some one that withstood her , and he said ,</l>
       <l n="438">“ What doest thou here ? ” Then she did turn and flee ,</l>
       <l n="439">Among those colored spirits , through the grove ,</l>
       <l n="440">Trembling for haste ; it was not well with her</l>
       <l n="441">Till she came forth of those thick banyan-trees ,</l>
       <l n="442">And set her feet upon the common grass ,</l>
       <l n="443">And felt the common wind .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="21">
       <l n="444">Yet once beyond ,</l>
       <l n="445">She could not choose but cast a backward glance .</l>
       <l n="446">The lovely matted growth stood like a wall ,</l>
       <l n="447">And means of entering were not evident ,—</l>
       <l n="448">The gap had closed . But Gladys laughed for joy :</l>
       <l n="449">She said , “ Remoteness and a multitude</l>
       <l n="450">Of years are counted nothing here . Behold ,</l>
       <l n="451">To-day I have been in Eden . O , it blooms</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="22">
       <l n="453">And she wandered on ,</l>
       <l n="454">Thinking , until she reached a place of palms ,</l>
       <l n="455">And all the earth was sandy where she walked ,—</l>
       <l n="456">Sandy and dry ,— strewed with papyrus leaves ,</l>
       <l n="457">Old idols , rings and pottery , painted lids</l>
       <l n="458">Of mummies ( for perhaps it was the way</l>
       <l n="459">That leads to dead old Egypt ) , and withal</l>
       <l n="460">Excellent sunshine cut out sharp and clear</l>
       <l n="461">The hot prone pillars , and the carven plinths ,—</l>
       <l n="462">Stone lotus cups , with petals dipped in sand ,</l>
       <l n="463">And wicked gods , and sphinxes bland , who sat</l>
       <l n="464">And smiled upon the ruin . O how still !</l>
       <l n="465">Hot , blank , illuminated with the clear</l>
       <l n="466">Stare of an unveiled sky . The dry stiff leaves</l>
       <l n="467">Of palm-trees never rustled , and the soul</l>
       <l n="468">Of that dead ancientry was itself dead .</l>
       <l n="469">She was above her ankles in the sand ,</l>
       <l n="470">When she beheld a rocky road , and , lo !</l>
       <l n="471">It bare in it the ruts of chariot wheels ,</l>
       <l n="472">Which erst had carried to their pagan prayers</l>
       <l n="473">The brown old Pharaohs ; for the ruts led on</l>
       <l n="474">To a great cliff , that either was a cliff</l>
       <l n="475">Or some dread shrine in ruins ,— partly reared</l>
       <l n="476">In front of that same cliff , and partly hewn</l>
       <l n="477">Or excavate within its heart . Great heaps</l>
       <l n="478">Of sand and stones on either side there lay ;</l>
       <l n="479">And , as the girl drew on , rose out from each ,</l>
       <l n="480">As from a ghostly kennel , gods unblest ,</l>
       <l n="481">Dog-headed , and behind them winged things</l>
       <l n="482">Like angels ; and this carven multitude</l>
       <l n="483">Hedged in , to right and left , the rocky road .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="23">
       <l n="484">At last , the cliff ,— and in the cliff a door</l>
       <l n="485">Yawning : and she looked in , as down the throat</l>
       <l n="486">Of some stupendous giant , and beheld</l>
       <l n="487">No floor , but wide , worn , flights of steps , that led</l>
       <l n="488">Into a dimness . When the eyes could bear</l>
       <l n="489">That change to gloom , she saw flight after flight ,</l>
       <l n="490">Flight after flight , the worn long stair go down ,</l>
       <l n="491">Smooth with the feet of nations dead and gone .</l>
       <l n="492">So she did enter ; also she went down</l>
       <l n="493">Till it was dark , and yet again went down ,</l>
       <l n="494">Till , gazing upward at that yawning door ,</l>
       <l n="495">It seemed no larger , in its height remote ,</l>
       <l n="496">Than a pin 's head . But while , irresolute ,</l>
       <l n="497">She doubted of the end , yet farther down</l>
       <l n="498">A slender ray of lamplight fell away</l>
       <l n="499">Along the stair , as from a door ajar :</l>
       <l n="500">To this again she felt her way , and stepped</l>
       <l n="501">Adown the hollow stair , and reached the light ;</l>
       <l n="502">But fear fell on her , fear ; and she forbore</l>
       <l n="503">Entrance , and listened . Ay ! ‘ twas even so ,—</l>
       <l n="504">A sigh ; the breathing as of one who slept</l>
       <l n="505">And was disturbed . So she drew back awhile ,</l>
       <l n="506">And trembled ; then her doubting hand she laid</l>
       <l n="507">Against the door , and pushed it ; but the light</l>
       <l n="508">Waned , faded , sank ; and as she came within —</l>
       <l n="509">Hark , hark ! A spirit was it , and asleep ?</l>
       <l n="510">A spirit doth not breathe like clay . There hung</l>

      <head>When found the rose delight in her fair hue ? Color is nothing to this world ; ‘ tis I That see it . Farther , I have found , my soul , That trees are nothing to their fellow trees ; It is but I that love their stateliness , And I that , comforting my heart , do sit At noon beneath their shadow . I will step On the ledges of this world , for it is mine ; But the other world ye wot of , shall go too ; I will carry it in my bosom . O my world , That was not built with clay ! Consider it ( This outer world we tread on ) as a harp ,— A gracious instrument on whose fair strings We learn those airs we shall be set to play When mortal hours are ended . Let the wings , Man , of thy spirit move on it as wind , And draw forth melody . Why shouldst thou yet Lie grovelling ? More is won than e'er was lost : Inherit . Let thy day be to thy night A teller of good tidings . Let thy praise Go up as birds go up that , when they wake , Shake off the dew and soar . So take Joy home , And make a place in thy great heart for her , And give her time to grow , and cherish her ; Then will she come , and oft will sing to thee , When thou art working in the furrows ; ay , Or weeding in the sacred hour of dawn . It is a comely fashion to be glad ,— Joy is the grace we say to God . Art tired ? There is a rest remaining . Hast thou sinned ? There is a Sacrifice . Lift up thy head , The lovely world , and the over-world alike , Ring with a song eterne , a happy rede , “ THY FATHER LOVES THEE . ”</head>
