    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In February , when the dawn was slow ,</l>
     <l n="2">And winds lay still , I gazed upon the fields</l>
     <l n="3">Which stretched before me , lifeless , and the stream</l>
     <l n="4">Which laboured in the distance to the sea ,</l>
     <l n="5">Sullen and cold . No force of fancy took</l>
     <l n="6">My thought to bloomy June , when all the land</l>
     <l n="7">Lay deep in crested grass , and through the dew</l>
     <l n="8">The landrail brushed , and the lush banks were set</l>
     <l n="9">With strawberries , and the hot noise of bees</l>
     <l n="10">Lulled the bright flowers . Rather I seemed to move</l>
     <l n="11">Thro ’ that weird land , Hellenic fancy feigned ,</l>
     <l n="12">Beyond the fabled river and the bark</l>
     <l n="13">Of Charon ; and forthwith on every side</l>
     <l n="14">Rose the thin throng of ghosts .</l>
     <l n="15">First thro ’ the gloom</l>
     <l n="16">Of a dark grove I strayed — a sluggish wood ,</l>
     <l n="17">Where scarce the faint fires of the setting stars ,</l>
     <l n="18">Or some cold gleam of half-discovered dawn ,</l>
     <l n="19">Might pierce the darkling pines . A twilight drear</l>
     <l n="20">Brooded o'er all the depths , and filled the dank</l>
     <l n="21">And sunken hollows of the rocks with shapes</l>
     <l n="22">Of terror ,— beckoning hands and noiseless feet</l>
     <l n="23">Flitting from shade to shade , wide eyes that stared</l>
     <l n="24">With horror , and dumb mouths which seemed to cry ,</l>
     <l n="25">Yet cried not . An ineffable despair</l>
     <l n="26">Hung over them and that dark world and took</l>
     <l n="27">The gazer captive , and a mingled pang</l>
     <l n="28">Of grief and anger , grown to fierce revolt</l>
     <l n="29">And hatred of the Invisible Force which holds</l>
     <l n="30">The issue of our lives and binds us fast</l>
     <l n="31">Within the net of Fate ; as the fisher takes</l>
     <l n="32">The little quivering sea-things from the sea</l>
     <l n="33">And flings them gasping on the beach to die</l>
     <l n="34">Then spreads his net for more . And then again</l>
     <l n="35">I knew myself and those , creatures who lie</l>
     <l n="36">Safe in the strong grasp of Unchanging Law ,</l>
     <l n="37">Encompassed round by hands unseen , and chains</l>
     <l n="38">Which do support the feeble life that else</l>
     <l n="39">Were spent on barren space ; and thus I came</l>
     <l n="40">To look with less of horror , more of thought ,</l>
     <l n="41">And bore to see the sight of pain that yet</l>
     <l n="42">Should grow to healing , when the concrete stain</l>
     <l n="43">Of life and act were purged , and the cleansed soul ,</l>
     <l n="44">Renewed by the slow wear and waste of time ,</l>
     <l n="45">Soared after aeons of days .</l>
     <l n="46">They seemed alone ,</l>
     <l n="47">Those prisoners , thro ’ all time . Each soul shut fast</l>
     <l n="48">In its own jail of woe , apart , alone ,</l>
     <l n="49">For evermore alone ; no thought of kin ,</l>
     <l n="50">Or kindly human glance , or fellowship</l>
     <l n="51">Of suffering or of sin , made light the load</l>
     <l n="52">Of solitary pain . Ay , though they walked</l>
     <l n="53">Together , or were prisoned in one cell</l>
     <l n="54">With the partners of their wrong , or with strange souls</l>
     <l n="55">Which the same Furies tore , they knew them not ,</l>
     <l n="56">But suffered still alone ; as in that shape</l>
     <l n="57">Of hell fools build on earth , where hopeless sin</l>
     <l n="58">Rots slow in solitude , nor sees the face</l>
     <l n="59">Of men , nor hears the sound of speech , nor feels</l>
     <l n="60">The touch of human hand , but broods a ghost ,</l>
     <l n="61">Hating the bare blank cell — the other self ,</l>
     <l n="62">Which brought it thither — hating man and God ,</l>
     <l n="63">And all that is or has been .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="64">A great fear</l>
     <l n="65">And pity froze my blood , who seemed to see</l>
     <l n="66">A half-remembered form .</l>
     <l n="67">An Eastern King</l>
     <l n="68">It was who lay in pain . He wore a crown</l>
     <l n="69">Upon his aching brow , and his white robe</l>
     <l n="70">Was jewelled with fair gems of price , the signs</l>
     <l n="71">Of pomp and honour and all luxury ,</l>
     <l n="72">Which might prevent desire . But as I looked</l>
     <l n="73">There came a hunger in the gloating eyes ,</l>
     <l n="74">A quenchless thirst upon the parching lips ,</l>
     <l n="75">And such unsatisfied strainings in the hands</l>
     <l n="76">Stretched idly forth on what I could not see ,</l>
     <l n="77">Some fatal food of fancy ; that I knew</l>
     <l n="78">The undying worm of sense , which frets and gnaws</l>
     <l n="79">The unsatisfied stained soul .</l>
     <l n="80">Seeing me , he said :</l>
     <l n="81">“ What ? And art thou too damned as I ? Dost know</l>
     <l n="82">This thirst as I , and see as I the cool</l>
     <l n="83">Lymph drawn from thee and mock thy lips ; and parch</l>
     <l n="84">For ever in continual thirst ; and mark</l>
     <l n="85">The fair fruit offered to thy hunger fade</l>
     <l n="86">Before thy longing eyes ? I thought there was</l>
     <l n="87">No other as I thro ’ all the weary lengths</l>
     <l n="88">Of Time the gods have made , who pined so long</l>
     <l n="89">And found fruition mock him .</l>
     <l n="90">Long ago ,</l>
     <l n="91">When I was young on earth , ‘ twas a sweet pain</l>
     <l n="92">To ride all day in the long chase , and feel</l>
     <l n="93">Toil and the summer fire my blood and parch</l>
     <l n="94">My lips , while in my father 's halls I knew</l>
     <l n="95">The cool bath waited , with its marble floor ;</l>
     <l n="96">And juices from the ripe fruits pressed , and chilled</l>
     <l n="97">With snows from far-off peaks ; and troops of slaves ;</l>
     <l n="98">And music and the dance ; and fair young forms .</l>
     <l n="99">And dalliance , and every joy of sense ,</l>
     <l n="100">That haunts the dreams of youth , which strength and ease</l>
     <l n="101">Corrupt , and vacant hours . Ay , it was sweet</l>
     <l n="102">For a while to plunge in these , as fair boys plunge</l>
     <l n="103">Naked in summer streams , all veil of shame</l>
     <l n="104">Laid by , only the young dear body bathed</l>
     <l n="105">And sunk in its delight , while the firm earth ,</l>
     <l n="106">The soft green pastures gay with innocent flowers ,</l>
     <l n="107">Or sober harvest fields , show like a dream ;</l>
     <l n="108">And nought is left , but the young life which floats</l>
     <l n="109">Upon the depths of death , to sink , maybe ,</l>
     <l n="110">And drown in pleasure , or rise at length grown wise</l>
     <l n="111">And gain the abandoned shore .</l>
     <l n="112">Ah , but at last</l>
     <l n="113">The swift desire waxed stronger and more strong ,</l>
     <l n="114">And feeding on itself , grows tyrannous ;</l>
     <l n="115">And the parched soul no longer finds delight</l>
     <l n="116">In the cool stream of old ; nay , this itself ,</l>
     <l n="117">Smitten by the fire of sense as by a flame ,</l>
     <l n="118">Holds not its coolness more ; and fevered limbs ,</l>
     <l n="119">Seeking the fresh tides of their youth , may find</l>
     <l n="120">No more refreshment , but a cauldron fired</l>
     <l n="121">With the fires of nether hell ; and a black rage</l>
     <l n="122">Usurps the soul , and drives it on to slake</l>
     <l n="123">Its thirst with crime and blood .</l>
     <l n="124">Longing Desire !</l>
     <l n="125">Unsatisfied , sick , impotent Desire !</l>
     <l n="126">Oh , I have known it ages long . I knew</l>
     <l n="127">Its pain on earth ere yet my life had grown</l>
     <l n="128">To its full stature , thro ’ the weary years</l>
     <l n="129">Of manhood , nay , in age itself ; I knew</l>
     <l n="130">The quenchless weary thirst , unsatisfied</l>
     <l n="131">By all the charms of sense , by wealth and power</l>
     <l n="132">And homage ; always craving , never quenched —</l>
     <l n="133">The undying curse of the soul ! The ministers</l>
     <l n="134">And agents of my will drave far and wide</l>
     <l n="135">Through all the land for me , seeking to find</l>
     <l n="136">Fresh pleasures for me , who had spent my sum</l>
     <l n="137">Of pleasure , and had power , not even in thought ,</l>
     <l n="138">Nor faculty to enjoy . They tore apart</l>
     <l n="139">The sacred claustral doors of home for me ,</l>
     <l n="140">Defiled the inviolate hearth for me , laid waste</l>
     <l n="141">The flower of humble lives , in hope to heal</l>
     <l n="142">The sickly fancies of the king , till rose</l>
     <l n="143">A cry of pain from all the land ; and I</l>
     <l n="144">Grew happier for it , since I held the power</l>
     <l n="145">To quench desire in blood .</l>
     <l n="146">But even thus</l>
     <l n="147">The old pain faded not , but swift again</l>
     <l n="148">Revived ; and thro ’ the sensual dull lengths</l>
     <l n="149">Of my seraglios I stalked , and marked</l>
     <l n="150">The glitter of the gems , the precious webs</l>
     <l n="151">Plundered from every clime by cruel wars</l>
     <l n="152">That strewed the sands with corpses ; lovely eyes</l>
     <l n="153">That looked no look of love , and fired no more</l>
     <l n="154">Thoughts of the flesh ; rich meats , and fruits , and wines</l>
     <l n="155">Grown flat and savourless ; and loathed them all ,</l>
     <l n="156">And only cared for power ; content to shed</l>
     <l n="157">Rivers of innocent blood , if only thus</l>
     <l n="158">I might appease my thirst . Until I grew</l>
     <l n="159">A monster gloating over blood and pain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="160">Ah , weary , weary days , when every sense</l>
     <l n="161">Was satisfied , and nothing left to slake</l>
     <l n="162">The parched unhappy soul , except to watch</l>
     <l n="163">The writhing limbs and mark the slow blood drip ,</l>
     <l n="164">Drop after drop , as the life ebbed with it ;</l>
     <l n="165">In a new thrill of lust , till blood itself</l>
     <l n="166">Palled on me , and I knew the fiend I was ,</l>
     <l n="167">Yet cared not — I who was , brief years ago ,</l>
     <l n="168">Only a careless boy lapt round with ease ,</l>
     <l n="169">Stretched by the soft and stealing tide of sense</l>
     <l n="170">Which now grew red ; nor ever dreamed at all</l>
     <l n="171">What Furies lurked beneath it , but had shrunk</l>
     <l n="172">In indolent horror from the sight of tears</l>
     <l n="173">And misery , and felt my inmost soul</l>
     <l n="174">Sicken with the thought of blood . There comes a time</l>
     <l n="175">When the insatiate brute within the man ,</l>
     <l n="176">Weary with wallowing in the mire , leaps forth</l>
     <l n="177">Devouring , and the cloven satyr-hoof</l>
     <l n="178">Grows to the rending claw , and the lewd leer</l>
     <l n="179">To the horrible fanged snarl , and the soul sinks</l>
     <l n="180">And leaves the man a devil , all his sin</l>
     <l n="181">Grown savourless , and yet he longs to sin</l>
     <l n="182">And longs in vain for ever .</l>
     <l n="183">Yet , methinks ,</l>
     <l n="184">It was not for the gods to leave me thus .</l>
     <l n="185">I stinted not their worship , building shrines</l>
     <l n="186">To all of them ; the Goddess of Love I served</l>
     <l n="187">With hecatombs , letting the fragrant fumes</l>
     <l n="188">Of incense and the costly steam ascend</l>
     <l n="189">From victims year by year ; nay , my own son</l>
     <l n="190">Pelops , my best beloved , I gave to them</l>
     <l n="191">Offering , as he must offer who would gain</l>
     <l n="192">The great gods ’ grace , my dearest .</l>
     <l n="193">I had gained</l>
     <l n="194">Through long and weary orgies that strange sense</l>
     <l n="195">Of nothingness and wasted days which blights</l>
     <l n="196">The exhausted life , bearing upon its front</l>
     <l n="197">Counterfeit knowledge , when the bitter ash</l>
     <l n="198">Of Evil , which the sick soul loathes , appears</l>
     <l n="199">Like the pure fruit of Wisdom . I had grown</l>
     <l n="200">As wizards seem , who mingle sensual rites</l>
     <l n="201">And forms impure with murderous spells and dark</l>
     <l n="202">Enchantments ; till the simple people held</l>
     <l n="203">My very weakness wisdom , and believed</l>
     <l n="204">That in my blood-stained palace-halls , withdrawn ,</l>
     <l n="205">I kept the inner mysteries of Zeus</l>
     <l n="206">And knew the secret of all Being ; who was</l>
     <l n="207">A sick and impotent wretch , so sick , so tired ,</l>
     <l n="208">That even bloodshed palled .</l>
     <l n="209">For my stained soul ,</l>
     <l n="210">Knowing its sin , hastened to purge itself</l>
     <l n="211">With every rite and charm which the dark lore</l>
     <l n="212">Of priestcraft offered to it . Spells obscene ,</l>
     <l n="213">The blood of innocent babes , sorceries foul</l>
     <l n="214">Muttered at midnight — these could occupy</l>
     <l n="215">My weary days ; till all my people shrank</l>
     <l n="216">To see me , and the mother clasped her child</l>
     <l n="217">Who heard the monster pass .</l>
     <l n="218">They would not hear .</l>
     <l n="219">They listened not — the cold ungrateful gods —</l>
     <l n="220">For all my supplications ; nay , the more</l>
     <l n="221">I sought them were they hidden .</l>
     <l n="222">At the last</l>
     <l n="223">A dark voice whispered nightly : ‘ Thou , poor wretch ,</l>
     <l n="224">That art so sick and impotent , thyself</l>
     <l n="225">The source of all thy misery , the great gods</l>
     <l n="226">Ask a more precious gift and excellent</l>
     <l n="227">Than alien victims which thou prizest not</l>
     <l n="228">And givest without a pang . But shouldst thou take</l>
     <l n="229">Thy costliest and fairest offering ,</l>
     <l n="230">‘ Twere otherwise . The life which thou hast given</l>
     <l n="231">Thou mayst recall . Go , offer at the shrine</l>
     <l n="232">Thy best beloved Pelops , and appease</l>
     <l n="233">Zeus and the averted gods , and know again</l>
     <l n="234">The youth and joy of yore . ’</l>
     <l n="235">Night after night ,</l>
     <l n="236">While all the halls were still , and the cold stars</l>
     <l n="237">Were fading into dawn , I lay awake</l>
     <l n="238">Distraught with warring thoughts , my throbbing brain</l>
     <l n="239">Filled with that dreadful voice . I had not shrunk</l>
     <l n="240">From blood , but this , the strong son of my youth —</l>
     <l n="241">How should I dare this thing ? And all day long</l>
     <l n="242">I would steal from sight of him and men , and fight</l>
     <l n="243">Against the dreadful thought , until the voice</l>
     <l n="244">Seared all my burning brain , and clamoured , ‘ Kill !</l>
     <l n="245">Zeus bids thee , and be happy . ’ Then I rose</l>
     <l n="246">At midnight , when the halls were still , and raised</l>
     <l n="247">The arras , and stole soft to where my son</l>
     <l n="248">Lay sleeping . For one moment on his face</l>
     <l n="249">And stalwart limbs I gazed , and marked the rise</l>
     <l n="250">And fall of his young breast , and the soft plume</l>
     <l n="251">Which drooped upon his brow , and felt a thrill</l>
     <l n="252">Of yearning ; but the cold voice urging me</l>
     <l n="253">Burned me like fire . Three times I gazed and turned</l>
     <l n="254">Irresolute , till last it thundered at me ,</l>
     <l n="255">‘ Strike , fool ! thou art in hell ; strike , fool ! and lose</l>
     <l n="256">The burden of thy chains . ’ Then with slow step</l>
     <l n="257">I crept as creeps the tiger on the deer ,</l>
     <l n="258">Raised high my arm , shut close my eyes , and plunged</l>
     <l n="259">My dagger in his heart .</l>
     <l n="260">And then , with a flash ,</l>
     <l n="261">The veil fell downward from my life and left</l>
     <l n="262">Myself to me — the daily sum of sense —</l>
     <l n="263">The long continual trouble of desire —</l>
     <l n="264">The stain of blood blotting the stain of lust —</l>
     <l n="265">The weary foulness of my days , which wrecked</l>
     <l n="266">My heart and brain , and left me at the last</l>
     <l n="267">A madman and accursed ; and I knew ,</l>
     <l n="268">Far higher than the sensual slope which held</l>
     <l n="269">The gods whom erst I worshipped , a white peak</l>
     <l n="270">Of Purity , and a stern voice pealing doom —</l>
     <l n="271">Not the mad voice of old — which pierced so deep</l>
     <l n="272">Within my life , that with the reeking blade</l>
     <l n="273">Wet with the heart 's blood of my child I smote</l>
     <l n="274">My guilty heart in twain .</l>
     <l n="275">Ah ! fool , to dream</l>
     <l n="276">That the long stain of time might fade and merge</l>
     <l n="277">In one poor chrism of blood . They taught of yore ,</l>
     <l n="278">My priests who flattered me — nor knew at all</l>
     <l n="279">The greater God I know , who sits afar</l>
     <l n="280">Beyond those earthly shapes , passionless , pure ,</l>
     <l n="281">And awful as the Dawn — that the gods cared</l>
     <l n="282">For costly victims , drinking in the steam</l>
     <l n="283">Of sacrifice when the choice hecatombs</l>
     <l n="284">Were offered for my wrong . Ah no ! there is</l>
     <l n="285">No recompense in these , nor any charm</l>
     <l n="286">To cleanse the stain of sin , but the long wear</l>
     <l n="287">Of suffering , when the soul which seized too much</l>
     <l n="288">Of pleasure here , grows righteous by the pain</l>
     <l n="289">That doth redress its ill. For what is Right</l>
     <l n="290">But equipoise of Nature , alternating</l>
     <l n="291">The Too Much and Too Little ? Not on earth</l>
     <l n="292">The salutary silent forces work</l>
     <l n="293">Their final victory , but year on year</l>
     <l n="294">Passes , and age on age , and leaves the debt</l>
     <l n="295">Unsatisfied , while the o'erburdened soul</l>
     <l n="296">Unloads itself in pain .</l>
     <l n="297">Therefore it is</l>
     <l n="298">I suffer as I suffered ere swift death</l>
     <l n="299">Set me not free , no otherwise ; and yet</l>
     <l n="300">There comes a healing purpose in my pain</l>
     <l n="301">I never knew on earth ; nor ever here</l>
     <l n="302">The once-loved evil grows , only the tale</l>
     <l n="303">Of penalties grown greater hourly dwarfs</l>
     <l n="304">The accomplished sum of wrong . And yet desire</l>
     <l n="305">Pursues me still — sick , impotent desire ,</l>
     <l n="306">Fiercer than that of earth .</l>
     <l n="307">We are ourselves</l>
     <l n="308">Our heaven and hell , the joy , the penalty ,</l>
     <l n="309">The yearning , the fruition . Earth is hell</l>
     <l n="310">Or heaven , and yet not only earth ; but still ,</l>
     <l n="311">After the swift soul leaves the gates of death ,</l>
     <l n="312">The pain grows deeper and less mixed , the joy</l>
     <l n="313">Purer and less alloyed , and we are damned</l>
     <l n="314">Or blest , as we have lived . ”</l>
     <l n="315">He ceased , with a wail</l>
     <l n="316">Like some complaining wind among the pines</l>
     <l n="317">Or pent among the fretful ocean caves ,</l>
     <l n="318">A sick , sad sound .</l>
     <l n="319">Then as I looked , I saw</l>
     <l n="320">His eyes glare horribly , his dry parched lips</l>
     <l n="321">Open , his weary hands stretch idly forth</l>
     <l n="322">As if to clutch the air — infinite pain</l>
     <l n="323">And mockery of hope . “ Seest thou them now ? ”</l>
     <l n="324">He said . “ I thirst , I parch , I famish , yet</l>
     <l n="325">They still elude me , fair and tempting fruit</l>
     <l n="326">And cooling waters . Now they come again .</l>
     <l n="327">See , they are in my grasp , they are at my lips ,</l>
     <l n="328">Now I shall quench me . Nay , again they fly</l>
     <l n="329">And mock me . Seest thou them , or am I shut</l>
     <l n="330">From hope for ever , hungering , thirsting still ,</l>
     <l n="331">A madman and in Hell ? ”</l>
     <l n="332">And as I passed</l>
     <l n="333">In horror , his large eyes and straining hands</l>
     <l n="334">Froze all my soul with pity .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="335">Then it was</l>
     <l n="336">A woman whom I saw : a dark pale Queen ,</l>
     <l n="337">With passion in her eyes , and fear and pain</l>
     <l n="338">Holding her steadfast gaze , like one who sees</l>
     <l n="339">Some dreadful deed of wrong worked out and knows</l>
     <l n="340">Himself the cause , yet now is powerless</l>
     <l n="341">To stay the wrong he would .</l>
     <l n="342">Seeing me gaze</l>
     <l n="343">In pity on her woe , she turned and spake</l>
     <l n="344">With a low wailing voice —</l>
     <l n="345">“ Thou well mayst gaze</l>
     <l n="346">With horror on me , sir , for I am lost ;</l>
     <l n="347">I have shed the innocent blood , long years ago ,</l>
     <l n="348">Nay , centuries of pain . I have shed the blood</l>
     <l n="349">Of him I loved , and found for recompense</l>
     <l n="350">But self-inflicted death and age-long woe ,</l>
     <l n="351">Which purges not my sin . And yet not I</l>
     <l n="352">It was who did it , but the gods , who took</l>
     <l n="353">A woman 's loveless heart and tortured it</l>
     <l n="354">With love as with a fire . It was not I</l>
     <l n="355">Who slew my love , but Fate . Fate ‘ twas which brought</l>
     <l n="356">My love and me together , Fate which barred</l>
     <l n="357">The path of blameless love , yet set Love 's flame</l>
     <l n="358">To burn and smoulder in a hopeless heart ,</l>
     <l n="359">Where no relief might come .</l>
     <l n="360">The King was old ,</l>
     <l n="361">And I a girl . ‘ Tis an old tale which runs</l>
     <l n="362">Thro ’ the sad ages , and ‘ twas mine . He had spent</l>
     <l n="363">His sum of love long since , and I — I knew not</l>
     <l n="364">A breath of Love as yet . Ah , it is strange</l>
     <l n="365">To lose the sense of maidenhood , drink deep</l>
     <l n="366">Of life to the very dregs , and yet not know</l>
     <l n="367">A flutter of Love 's wing . Love takes no thought</l>
     <l n="368">For pomp , or palace , or respect of men ;</l>
     <l n="369">Nor always in the stately marriage bed ,</l>
     <l n="370">Closed round by silken curtains , laid on down ,</l>
     <l n="371">Nestles a rosy form ; but ‘ mid wild flowers</l>
     <l n="372">Or desert tents , or in the hind 's low cot ,</l>
     <l n="373">Beneath the aspect of the unconscious stars ,</l>
     <l n="374">Dwells all night and is blest .</l>
     <l n="375">My love , my life !</l>
     <l n="376">He was the old man 's son , a fair white soul —</l>
     <l n="377">Not like the others , whom the fire of youth</l>
     <l n="378">Burns like a flame and hurries unrestrained</l>
     <l n="379">Thro ’ riotous days and nights , but virginal</l>
     <l n="380">And pure as any maid . No wandering glance</l>
     <l n="381">He deigned for all the maidens young and fair</l>
     <l n="382">Who sought their Prince 's eye . But evermore ,</l>
     <l n="383">Upon the high lawns wandering alone ,</l>
     <l n="384">He dwelt unwed ; weaving to Artemis ,</l>
     <l n="385">Fairest of all Olympian maids , a wreath</l>
     <l n="386">From the unpolluted meads , where never herd</l>
     <l n="387">Drives his white flock , nor ever scythe has come ,</l>
     <l n="388">But the bee sails upon unfettered wing</l>
     <l n="389">Over the spring-like lawns , and Purity</l>
     <l n="390">Waters them with soft dews ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>and yet he showed</l>
     <l n="391">Of all his peers most manly — heart and soul</l>
     <l n="392">A very man , tender and true , and strong</l>
     <l n="393">And pitiful , and in his limbs and mien</l>
     <l n="394">Fair as Apollo 's self .</l>
     <l n="395">It was at first</l>
     <l n="396">In Troezen that I saw him , when he came</l>
     <l n="397">To greet his sire . Amid the crowd of youths</l>
     <l n="398">He showed a Prince indeed ; yet knew I not</l>
     <l n="399">Whom ‘ twas I saw , nor that I held the place</l>
     <l n="400">Which was his mother 's , only from the throng</l>
     <l n="401">Love , with a barbed dart aiming , pierced my heart</l>
     <l n="402">Ere yet I knew what ailed me . Every glance</l>
     <l n="403">Fired me ; the youthful grace , the tall straight limbs ,</l>
     <l n="404">The swelling sinewy arms , the large dark eyes</l>
     <l n="405">Tender yet full of passion , the thick locks</l>
     <l n="406">Tossed from his brow , the lip and cheek which bore</l>
     <l n="407">The down of early manhood , seemed to feed</l>
     <l n="408">My heart with short-lived joy .</l>
     <l n="409">For when he stood</l>
     <l n="410">Forth from the throng and knelt before his sire ,</l>
     <l n="411">Then raised his eyes to mine , I felt the curse</l>
     <l n="412">Of Aphrodite burn me , as it burned</l>
     <l n="413">My mother before me , and I dared not meet</l>
     <l n="414">His innocent , frank young eyes .</l>
     <l n="415">Said I then young ?</l>
     <l n="416">Ay , but not young as mine . For I had known</l>
     <l n="417">The secret things of life , which age the soul</l>
     <l n="418">In a moment , writing on its front their mark</l>
     <l n="419">‘ Too early ripe ; ’ and he was innocent ,</l>
     <l n="420">My spouse in fitted years , within whose arms</l>
     <l n="421">I had defied the world .</l>
     <l n="422">I turned away</l>
     <l n="423">Like some white bird that leaves the flock , which sails</l>
     <l n="424">High in mid air above the haunts of men ,</l>
     <l n="425">Feeling some little dart within her breast ,</l>
     <l n="426">Not death , but like to death , and slowly sinks</l>
     <l n="427">Down to the earth alone , and bears her hurt</l>
     <l n="428">Unseen , by herbless sand and bitter pool ,</l>
     <l n="429">And pines until the end .</l>
     <l n="430">Even from that day</l>
     <l n="431">I strove to gain his love . Nay , ‘ twas not I ,</l>
     <l n="432">But the cruel gods who drove me . Day by day</l>
     <l n="433">We were together ; for in days of old</l>
     <l n="434">Women were free , not pent in gilded jails</l>
     <l n="435">As afterwards , but free to walk alone ,</l>
     <l n="436">For good or evil , free . I hardly took</l>
     <l n="437">Thought for my spouse , the King . For I had found</l>
     <l n="438">My love at last : what matter if it were</l>
     <l n="439">A guilty love ? Yet love is love indeed ,</l>
     <l n="440">Stronger than heaven or hell . Day after day</l>
     <l n="441">I set myself to tempt him from his proud</l>
     <l n="442">And innocent way , for I had spurned aside</l>
     <l n="443">Care for the gods or men — all but my love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="444">What need to tell the tale ? Was it a sigh ,</l>
     <l n="445">A blush , a momentary glance , which brought</l>
     <l n="446">Assurance of my triumph ? It is long</l>
     <l n="447">Since I have lived , I cannot tell ; I know</l>
     <l n="448">Only the penalty of death and hell</l>
     <l n="449">Which followed on my sin . I knew he loved .</l>
     <l n="450">It was not wonderful , seeing that we dwelt</l>
     <l n="451">A boy and girl together . I was fair ,</l>
     <l n="452">And Eros fired my eyes and lent my voice</l>
     <l n="453">His own soft tremulous tones . But when our souls</l>
     <l n="454">Trembled upon the verge , and fancy feigned</l>
     <l n="455">His arms around me as we fled alone</l>
     <l n="456">To some free land of exile , lo ! a scroll :</l>
     <l n="457">‘ Dearest , it may not be ; I fear the Gods ;</l>

     <l n="459">And see thy face no more . Farewell ! Forget</l>
     <l n="460">The love we may not own ; go , seek for both</l>
     <l n="461">Forgiveness from the gods . ’</l>
     <l n="462">When I read the words ,</l>
     <l n="463">The cruel words , methought my heart stood still ,</l>
     <l n="464">And when the ebbing life returned I seemed</l>
     <l n="465">To have lost all thought of Love . Only Revenge</l>
     <l n="466">Dwelt with me still , the fiercer that I knew</l>
     <l n="467">My long-prized hope , which came so near success ,</l>
     <l n="468">Snatched from me and for ever .</l>
     <l n="469">When I rose</l>
     <l n="470">From my deep swoon , I bade a messenger</l>
     <l n="471">Go , seek the King for me . He came and sate</l>
     <l n="472">Beside my couch , and all the doors were closed ,</l>
     <l n="473">And all withdrawn . Then with the liar 's art ,</l>
     <l n="474">And hypocrite tears , and feigned reluctancy ,</l>
     <l n="475">And all the subtle wiles a woman draws</l>
     <l n="476">From the armoury of hate , I did instil</l>
     <l n="477">The poison to his soul . Cunning devices ,</l>
     <l n="478">Feigned sorrow , mention of his son , regrets ,</l>
     <l n="479">And half confessions — these , with hateful skill</l>
     <l n="480">Confused together , drove the old man 's soul</l>
     <l n="481">To frenzy ; and I watched him , with a sneer ,</l>
     <l n="482">Turn to a dotard thirsting for the life</l>
     <l n="483">Of his own child . But how to do the deed ,</l>
     <l n="484">Yet shed no blood , nor know the people 's hate ,</l>
     <l n="485">Who loved the Prince , I knew not .</l>
     <l n="486">Till one day</l>
     <l n="487">The old man , looking out upon the sea ,</l>
     <l n="488">Besought the dread Poseidon to avenge</l>
     <l n="489">The treachery of his son . Even as we stood</l>
     <l n="490">Gazing upon the breathless blue , a cloud</l>
     <l n="491">Rose from the deep , a little fleecy cloud ,</l>
     <l n="492">Which sudden grew and grew , and turned the blue</l>
     <l n="493">To purple ; and a swift wind rose and sang</l>
     <l n="494">Higher and higher , and the wine-dark sea</l>
     <l n="495">Grew ruffled , and within the circling bay</l>
     <l n="496">The tiny ripples , stealing up the sand ,</l>
     <l n="497">Plunged loud with manes of foam , until they swelled</l>
     <l n="498">To misty surges thundering on the shore .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="499">Then at the old man 's elbow as I stood ,</l>
     <l n="500">A deep dark thought , sent by the powers of ill ,</l>
     <l n="501">Answering , as now I know , my own black hate</l>
     <l n="502">And not my poor dupe 's anger , fired my soul</l>
     <l n="503">And bade me speak . ‘ The god has heard thy prayer , ’</l>
     <l n="504">I whispered ; ‘ See the surge which wakes and swells</l>
     <l n="505">To fury ; well I know what things shall be .</l>
     <l n="506">It is Poseidon 's voice sounds in the storm</l>
     <l n="507">And sends thy vengeance . Young Hippolytus</l>
     <l n="508">Loves , as thou knowest , on the yellow sand ,</l>
     <l n="509">Hard by the rippled margin of the wave ,</l>
     <l n="510">To urge his flying steeds . Bid him go forth —</l>
     <l n="511">He will obey — and see what recompense</l>
     <l n="512">The god will send his wrong . ’</l>
     <l n="513">In the old man 's eyes</l>
     <l n="514">A watery gleam of malice played awhile —</l>
     <l n="515">I hated him for it — and he bade his son</l>
     <l n="516">Drive forth his chariot on the sand , and yoke</l>
     <l n="517">His three young fiery steeds .</l>
     <l n="518">And still the storm</l>
     <l n="519">Blew fiercer and more fierce , and the white crests</l>
     <l n="520">Plunged on the strand , and the high promontories</l>
     <l n="521">Resounded counter-stricken , and a mist</l>
     <l n="522">Of foam , blown landward , hid the sounding shore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="523">Then saw I him come forth and bid them yoke</l>
     <l n="524">His untamed colts . I had not seen his face</l>

     <l n="526">The old love spring anew , yet mixed with hate —</l>
     <l n="527">A storm of warring passions . Tho ’ I knew</l>
     <l n="528">What end should come , yet would I speak no word</l>
     <l n="529">That might avert it . The old man looked forth ;</l>
     <l n="530">I think he had well-nigh forgotten all</l>
     <l n="531">The wrong he fancied and the doom he prayed ,</l>
     <l n="532">All but the father 's pride in the strong son ,</l>
     <l n="533">Who was so young and bold . I saw a smile</l>
     <l n="534">Upon the dotard 's face , when now the steeds</l>
     <l n="535">Were harnessed and the chariot , on the sand</l>
     <l n="536">Along the circling margin of the bay ,</l>
     <l n="537">Flew , swift as light . A sudden gleam of sun</l>
     <l n="538">Flashed on the silver harness as it went ,</l>
     <l n="539">Burned on the brazen axles of the wheels ,</l>
     <l n="540">And on the golden fillets of the Prince</l>
     <l n="541">Doubled the gold . Sometimes a larger wave</l>
     <l n="542">Would dash in mist around him , and in fear</l>
     <l n="543">The rearing coursers plunged , and then again</l>
     <l n="544">The strong young arm constrained them , and they flashed</l>
     <l n="545">To where the wave-worn foreland ends the bay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="546">And then he turned his chariot , a bright speck</l>
     <l n="547">Now seen , now hidden , but always , tho ’ the surge</l>
     <l n="548">Broke round it , safe ; emerging like a star</l>
     <l n="549">From the white clouds of foam . And as I watched ,</l>
     <l n="550">Speaking no word , and breathing scarce a breath ,</l>
     <l n="551">I saw the firm limbs strongly set apart</l>
     <l n="552">Upon the chariot , and the reins held high ,</l>
     <l n="553">And the proud head bent forward , with long locks</l>
     <l n="554">Streaming behind , as nearer and more near</l>
     <l n="555">The swift team rushed — until , with a half joy ,</l>
     <l n="556">It seemed as if my love might yet elude</l>
     <l n="557">The slow sure anger of the god , dull wrath</l>
     <l n="558">Swayed by a woman 's lie .</l>
     <l n="559">But on the verge ,</l>
     <l n="560">As I cast my eyes , a vast and purple wall</l>
     <l n="561">Swelled swiftly towards the land ; the lesser waves</l>
     <l n="562">Sank as it came , and to its toppling crest</l>
     <l n="563">The spume-flecked waters , from the strand drawn back ,</l>
     <l n="564">Left dry the yellow shore . Onward it came ,</l>
     <l n="565">Hoarse , capped with breaking foam , lurid , immense ,</l>
     <l n="566">Rearing its dreadful height . The chariot sped</l>
     <l n="567">Nearer and nearer . I could see my love</l>
     <l n="568">With the light of victory in his eyes , the smile</l>
     <l n="569">Of daring on his lips : so near he came</l>
     <l n="570">To where the marble palace-wall confined</l>
     <l n="571">The narrow strip of beach — his brave young eyes</l>
     <l n="572">Fixed steadfast on the goal , in the pride of life ,</l>
     <l n="573">Without a thought of death . I strove to cry ,</l>
     <l n="574">But terror choked my breath . Then , like a bull</l>
     <l n="575">Upon the windy level of the plain</l>
     <l n="576">Lashing himself to rage , the furious wave ,</l>
     <l n="577">Poising itself a moment , tossing high</l>
     <l n="578">Its wind-vexed crest , dashed downward on the strand</l>
     <l n="579">With a stamp , with a rush , with a roar .</l>
     <l n="580">And when I looked ,</l>
     <l n="581">The shore , the fields , the plain , were one white sea</l>
     <l n="582">Of churning , seething foam — chariot and steeds</l>
     <l n="583">Gone , and my darling on the wave 's white crest</l>
     <l n="584">Tossed high , whirled down , beaten , and bruised , and flung ,</l>
     <l n="585">Dying upon the marble .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="586">My great love</l>
     <l n="587">Sprang up redoubled , and cast out my hate</l>
     <l n="588">And spurned all thought of fear ; and down the stair</l>
     <l n="589">I hurried , and upon the bleeding form</l>
     <l n="590">I threw myself , and raised his head , and clasped</l>
     <l n="591">His body to mine , and kissed him on the lips ,</l>
     <l n="592">And in his dying ear confessed my wrong ,</l>
     <l n="593">And saw the horror in his dying eyes</l>
     <l n="594">And knew that I was damned . And when he breathed</l>
     <l n="595">His last pure breath , I rose and slowly spake —</l>
     <l n="596">Turned to a Fury now by love and pain —</l>
     <l n="597">To the old man who knelt , while all the throng</l>
     <l n="598">Could hear my secret : ‘ See , thou fool , I am</l>
     <l n="599">The murderess of thy son , and thou my dupe ,</l>
     <l n="600">Thou and thy gods . See , he was innocent ;</l>
     <l n="601">I murdered him for love . I scorn ye all ,</l>
     <l n="602">Thee and thy gods together , who are deceived</l>
     <l n="603">By a woman 's lying tongue ! Oh , doting fool ,</l>
     <l n="604">To hate thy own ! And ye , false powers , which punish</l>
     <l n="605">The innocent , and let the guilty soul</l>
     <l n="606">Escape unscathed , I hate ye all — I curse ,</l>
     <l n="607">I loathe you ! ’</l>
     <l n="608">Then I stooped and kissed my love ,</l>
     <l n="609">And left them in amaze ; and up the stair</l>
     <l n="610">Swept slowly to my chamber , and therein ,</l>
     <l n="611">Hating my life and cursing men and gods ,</l>
     <l n="612">I did myself to death .</l>
     <l n="613">But even here ,</l>
     <l n="614">I find my punishment . Oh , dreadful doom</l>
     <l n="615">Of souls like mine ! To see their evil done</l>
     <l n="616">Always before their eyes , the one dread scene</l>
     <l n="617">Of horror . See , the dark wave on the verge</l>
     <l n="618">Towers horrible , and he —— Oh , Love , my Love !</l>
     <l n="619">Safety is near ! quick ! quicker ! urge them on !</l>
     <l n="620">Thou wilt ‘ scape it yet !— Nay , nay , it bursts on him !</l>
     <l n="621">I have shed the innocent blood ! Oh , dreadful gaze</l>
     <l n="622">Within his glazing eyes ! Hide them , ye gods !</l>
     <l n="623">Hide them ! I cannot bear them . Quick ! a dagger !</l>
     <l n="624">I will lose their glare in death . Nay , die I cannot ;</l>
     <l n="625">I must endure and live — Death brings not peace</l>
     <l n="626">To the lost souls in Hell . ”</l>
     <l n="627">And her eyes stared ,</l>
     <l n="628">Rounded with horror , and she stooped and gazed</l>
     <l n="629">So eagerly , and pressed her fevered hands</l>
     <l n="630">Upon her trembling forehead with such pain</l>
     <l n="631">As drives the gazer mad .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="632">Then as I passed ,</l>
     <l n="633">I marked against the hardly dawning sky</l>
     <l n="634">A toilsome figure standing , bent and strained ,</l>
     <l n="635">Before a rocky mass , which with great pain</l>
     <l n="636">And agony of labour it would thrust</l>
     <l n="637">Up a steep hill . But when upon the crest</l>
     <l n="638">It poised a moment , then I held my breath</l>
     <l n="639">With dread , for , lo ! the poor feet seemed to clutch</l>
     <l n="640">The hillside as in fear , and the poor hands</l>
     <l n="641">With hopeless fingers pressed into the stone</l>
     <l n="642">In agony , and the limbs stiffened , and a cry</l>
     <l n="643">Like some strong swimmer 's , whom the mightier stream</l>
     <l n="644">Sweeps downward , and he sees his children 's eyes</l>
     <l n="645">Upon the bank ; broke from him ; and at last ,</l>
     <l n="646">After long struggles of despair , the limbs</l>
     <l n="647">Relaxed , and as I closed my fearful eyes ,</l>
     <l n="648">Seeing the inevitable doom — a crash ,</l>
     <l n="649">A horrible thunderous noise , as down the steep</l>
     <l n="650">The shameless fragment leapt . From crag to crag</l>
     <l n="651">It bounded ever swifter , striking fire</l>
     <l n="652">And wrapt in smoke , as to the lowest depths</l>
     <l n="653">Of the vale it tore , and seemed to take with it</l>
     <l n="654">The miserable form whose painful gaze</l>
     <l n="655">I caught , as with the great rock whirled and dashed</l>
     <l n="656">Downward , and marking every crag with gore</l>
     <l n="657">And long gray hairs , it plunged , yet living still ,</l>
     <l n="658">To the black hollow ; and then a silence came</l>
     <l n="659">More dreadful than the noise , and a low groan</l>
     <l n="660">Was all that I could hear .</l>
     <l n="661">When to the foot</l>
     <l n="662">Of the dark steep I hurried , half in hope</l>
     <l n="663">To find the victim dead — not recognizing</l>
     <l n="664">The undying life of Hell — I seemed to see</l>
     <l n="665">An aged man , bruised , bleeding , with gray hairs ,</l>
     <l n="666">And eyes from which the cunning leer of greed</l>
     <l n="667">Was scarcely yet gone out .</l>
     <l n="668">A crafty voice</l>
     <l n="669">It was that answered me , the voice of guile</l>
     <l n="670">Part purified by pain :</l>
     <l n="671">“ There comes not death</l>
     <l n="672">To those who live in Hell , nor hardly pause</l>
     <l n="673">Of suffering longer than may serve to make</l>
     <l n="674">The pain renewed , more piercing . Long ago ,</l>
     <l n="675">I thought that I had cheated Death , and now</l>
     <l n="676">I seek him ; but he comes not , nor know I</l>
     <l n="677">If ever he will hear me . Whence art thou ?</l>
     <l n="678">Comest thou from earthly air , or whence ? What power</l>
     <l n="679">Has brought thee hither ? For I know indeed</l>
     <l n="680">Thou art not lost as I ; for never here</l>
     <l n="681">I look upon a human face , nor see</l>
     <l n="682">The ghosts who doubtless here on every side</l>
     <l n="683">Suffer a common pain , only at times</l>
     <l n="684">I hear the echo of a shriek far off ,</l>
     <l n="685">Like some faint ghost of woe which fills the pause</l>
     <l n="686">And interval of suffering ; but from whom</l>
     <l n="687">The voice may come , or whence , I know not , only</l>
     <l n="688">The air teems with vague pain , which doth distract</l>
     <l n="689">The ear when for a moment comes surcease</l>
     <l n="690">Of agony , and the sense of effort spent</l>
     <l n="691">In vain and fruitless labour , and the pang</l>
     <l n="692">Of long-deferred defeat , which waits and takes</l>
     <l n="693">The world-worn heart , and maddens it when all —</l>
     <l n="694">Heaven , conscience , happiness , are staked and lost</l>
     <l n="695">For gains which still elude it .</l>
     <l n="696">Yet ‘ twas sweet ,</l>
     <l n="697">A King in early youth , when pleasure is sweet ,</l>
     <l n="698">To live the fair successful years , and know</l>
     <l n="699">The envy and respect of men . I cared</l>
     <l n="700">For none of youth 's delights : the dance , the song ,</l>
     <l n="701">Allured me not ; the smooth soft ways of sense</l>
     <l n="702">Tempted me not at all . I could despise</l>
     <l n="703">The follies that I shared not , spending all</l>
     <l n="704">The long laborious days in toilsome schemes</l>
     <l n="705">To compass honour and wealth , and , as I grew</l>
     <l n="706">In name and fame , finding my hoarded gains</l>
     <l n="707">Transmuted into Power . The seas were white</l>
     <l n="708">With laden argosies , and all were mine .</l>
     <l n="709">The sheltering moles defied the wintry storms ,</l>
     <l n="710">And all were mine . The marble aqueducts ,</l>
     <l n="711">The costly bridges , all were mine . Fair roads</l>
     <l n="712">Wound round and round the hills — my work . The gods</l>
     <l n="713">Alone I heeded not , nor cared at all</l>
     <l n="714">For aught but that my eyes and ears might take ,</l>
     <l n="715">Spurning invisible things , nor built I to them</l>
     <l n="716">Temple or shrine , wrapt up in life , set round</l>
     <l n="717">With earthly blessings like a god . I rose</l>
     <l n="718">To such excess of weal and fame and pride ,</l>
     <l n="719">My people held me god-like . I grew drunk</l>
     <l n="720">With too great power , scoffing at men and gods ,</l>
     <l n="721">Careless of both , but not averse to fling</l>
     <l n="722">To those too weak themselves , what benefits</l>
     <l n="723">My larger wisdom spurned .</l>
     <l n="724">Then suddenly</l>
     <l n="725">I knew the pain of failure . Summer storms</l>
     <l n="726">Sucked down my fleets even within sight of port .</l>
     <l n="727">A grievous blight wasted the harvest-fields ,</l>
     <l n="728">Mocking my hopes of gain . Wars came and drained</l>
     <l n="729">My store , and I grew needy , knowing now</l>
     <l n="730">The hell of stronger souls , the loss of power</l>
     <l n="731">Wherein they exulted once . There comes no pain</l>
     <l n="732">Deeper than to have known delight of power ,</l>
     <l n="733">And then to lose it all . But I , I would not</l>
     <l n="734">Sit tame beneath defeat , trimming my sails</l>
     <l n="735">To wait the breeze of Fortune — fickle breath</l>
     <l n="736">Which perhaps might breathe no more — but chose instead</l>
     <l n="737">By rash conceit and bolder enterprise</l>
     <l n="738">To win her aid again . I had no thought</l>
     <l n="739">Of selfish gain , only to be and act</l>
     <l n="740">As a god to those , feeding my sum of pride</l>
     <l n="741">With acted good .</l>
     <l n="742">But evermore defeat</l>
     <l n="743">Dogged me , and evermore my people grew</l>
     <l n="744">To doubt me , seeing no more the wealth , the force ,</l>
     <l n="745">Which once they worshipped . Then the lust of power</l>
     <l n="746">Loved , not for sake of others , but itself ,</l>
     <l n="747">Grew on me , and the pride which can dare all ,</l>
     <l n="748">Save failure only , seized me . Evil finds</l>
     <l n="749">Its ready chance . There were rich argosies</l>
     <l n="750">Upon the seas : I sank them , ship and crew ,</l>
     <l n="751">In the unbetraying ocean . Wayfarers</l>
     <l n="752">Crossing the passes with rich merchandise</l>
     <l n="753">My creatures , hid behind the crags , o'erwhelmed</l>
     <l n="754">With rocks hurled downward . Yet I spent my gains</l>
     <l n="755">For the public weal , not otherwise ; and they ,</l>
     <l n="756">The careless people , took the piteous spoils</l>
     <l n="757">Which cost the lives of many , and a man 's soul ,</l>
     <l n="758">And blessed the giver . Empty venal blessings ,</l>
     <l n="759">Which sting more deep than curses !</l>
     <l n="760">For awhile</l>
     <l n="761">I was content with this , but at the last</l>
     <l n="762">A great contempt and hatred of them took me ,</l>
     <l n="763">The base , vile churls ! Why should I stain my soul</l>
     <l n="764">For such as those — dogs that would fawn and lick</l>
     <l n="765">The hand that fed them , but , if food should fail ,</l>
     <l n="766">Would turn and rend me ? I would none of them ;</l>
     <l n="767">I would grow rich and happy , being indeed</l>
     <l n="768">Godlike in brain to such . So with all craft ,</l>
     <l n="769">And guile , and violence I enriched me , loading</l>
     <l n="770">My treasuries with gold . My deep-laid schemes</l>
     <l n="771">Of gain engrossed the long laborious days ,</l>
     <l n="772">Stretched far into the night . Enjoy , I might not ,</l>
     <l n="773">Seeing it was all to do , and life so brief</l>
     <l n="774">That ere a man might gain the goal he would ,</l>
     <l n="775">Lo ! Age , and with it Death , and so an end !</l>
     <l n="776">For all the tales of the indignant gods ,</l>
     <l n="777">What were they but the priests ’ ? I had myself</l>
     <l n="778">Broken all oaths ; long time deceived and ruined</l>
     <l n="779">With every phase of fraud the pious fools</l>
     <l n="780">Whom oath-sworn Justice bound ; battened on blood</l>
     <l n="781">And what was I the worse ? How should the gods</l>
     <l n="782">Bear rule if I were happy ? Death alone</l>
     <l n="783">Was certain . Therefore must I haste to heap</l>
     <l n="784">Treasure sufficient for my need , and then</l>
     <l n="785">Enjoy the gathered good .</l>
     <l n="786">But gradually</l>
     <l n="787">There came — not great disasters which might crush</l>
     <l n="788">All hope , but petty checks which did decrease</l>
     <l n="789">My store , and left my labour vain , and me</l>
     <l n="790">Unwilling to enjoy ; and gradually</l>
     <l n="791">I felt the chill approach of age , which stole</l>
     <l n="792">Higher and higher on me , till the life ,</l>
     <l n="793">As in a paralytic , left my limbs</l>
     <l n="794">And heart , and mounted upwards to my brain ,</l>
     <l n="795">Its last resort , and rested there awhile</l>
     <l n="796">Ere it should spread its wings . But even thus ,</l>
     <l n="797">Tho ’ powerless to enjoy , the insatiate greed</l>
     <l n="798">And thirst of power sustained me , and supplied</l>
     <l n="799">Life 's spark with some scant fuel , till it seemed ,</l>
     <l n="800">Year after year , as if I could not die ,</l>
     <l n="801">Holding so fast to life . I grew so old</l>
     <l n="802">That all the comrades of my youth , my prime ,</l>
     <l n="803">My age , were gone , and I was left alone</l>
     <l n="804">With those who knew me not , bereft of all</l>
     <l n="805">Except my master passion — an old man</l>
     <l n="806">Forlorn , forgotten of the gods and Death .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="807">So all the people , seeing me grow old</l>
     <l n="808">And prosperous , held me wise , and spread abroad</l>
     <l n="809">Strange fables , growing day by day more strange —</l>
     <l n="810">How I deceived the very gods . They thought</l>
     <l n="811">That I was blest , remembering not the wear</l>
     <l n="812">Of anxious thought , the growing sum of pain ,</l>
     <l n="813">The failing ear and eye , the slower limbs ,</l>
     <l n="814">Whose briefer name is Age : and yet I trow</l>
     <l n="815">I was not all unhappy , though I knew</l>
     <l n="816">It was too late to enjoy , and though my store</l>
     <l n="817">Increased not as my greed — nay , even sunk down</l>
     <l n="818">A little , year by year . Till , last of all ,</l>
     <l n="819">When now my time was come and I had grown</l>
     <l n="820">A little tired of living , a trivial hurt</l>
     <l n="821">Laid me upon my bed ; and as I mused</l>
     <l n="822">On my long life and all its villanies ,</l>
     <l n="823">The wickedness I did , the blood I shed ,</l>
     <l n="824">The guile , the frauds of years — they came with news ,</l>
     <l n="825">One now , and now another ; how my schemes</l>
     <l n="826">Were crushed , my enterprises lost , my toil</l>
     <l n="827">And labour all in vain . Day after day</l>
     <l n="828">They brought these tidings , while I longed to rise</l>
     <l n="829">And stay the tide of ill , and raved to know</l>
     <l n="830">I could not . At the last the added sum</l>
     <l n="831">Of evil , like yon great rock poised awhile</l>
     <l n="832">Uncertain , gathered into one , o'erwhelmed</l>
     <l n="833">My feeble strength , and left me ruined and lost ,</l>
     <l n="834">And showed me all I was , and all the depth</l>
     <l n="835">And folly of my sin , and racked my brain ,</l>
     <l n="836">And sank me in despair and misery ,</l>
     <l n="837">And broke my heart and slew me .</l>
     <l n="838">Therefore ‘ tis</l>
     <l n="839">I spend the long , long centuries which have come</l>
     <l n="840">Between me and my sin , in such dread tasks</l>
     <l n="841">As that thou sawest . In the soul I sinned :</l>
     <l n="842">In body and soul I suffer . What I bade</l>
     <l n="843">My minions do to others , that of woe</l>
     <l n="844">I bear myself ; and in the pause of ill ,</l>
     <l n="845">As now , I know again the bitter pang</l>
     <l n="846">Of failure , which of old pierced thro ’ my soul</l>
     <l n="847">And left me to despair . The pain of mind</l>
     <l n="848">Is fiercer far than any bodily ill ,</l>
     <l n="849">And both are mine — the pang of torture-pain</l>
     <l n="850">Always recurring ; and , far worse , the pang</l>
     <l n="851">Of consciousness of black sins sinned in vain —</l>
     <l n="852">The doom of constant failure .</l>
     <l n="853">Will , fierce Will !</l>
     <l n="854">Thou parent of unrest and toil and woe ,</l>
     <l n="855">Measureless effort ! growing day by day</l>
     <l n="856">To force strong souls along the giddy steep</l>
     <l n="857">That slopes to the pit of Hell , where effort serves</l>
     <l n="858">Only to speed destruction ! Yet I know</l>
     <l n="859">Thou art not , as some hold , the primal curse</l>
     <l n="860">Which doth condemn us ; since thou bearest in thee</l>
     <l n="861">No power to satisfy thyself ; but rather ,</l>
     <l n="862">The spring of act , whereby in earth and heaven</l>
     <l n="863">Both men and gods do breathe and live and are ,</l>
     <l n="864">Since Life is Act and not to Do is Death —</l>
     <l n="865">I do not blame thee : but to work in vain</l>
     <l n="866">Is bitterest penalty : to find at last</l>
     <l n="867">The soul all fouled with sin and stained with blood</l>
     <l n="868">In vain ; ah , this is hell indeed — the hell</l>
     <l n="869">Of lost and striving souls ! ”</l>
     <l n="870">Then as I passed ,</l>
     <l n="871">The halting figure bent itself again</l>
     <l n="872">To the old task , and up the rugged steep</l>
     <l n="873">Thrust the great rock with groanings . Horror chained</l>
     <l n="874">My parting footsteps , like a nightmare dream</l>
     <l n="875">Which holds us that we flee not , with wide eyes</l>
     <l n="876">That loathe to see , yet cannot choose but gaze</l>
     <l n="877">Till all be done . Slowly , with dreadful toil</l>
     <l n="878">And struggle and strain , and bleeding hands and knees ,</l>
     <l n="879">And more than mortal strength , against the hill</l>
     <l n="880">He pressed , the wretched one ! till with long pain</l>
     <l n="881">He trembled on the summit , a gaunt form ,</l>
     <l n="882">With that great rock above him , poised and strained ,</l>
     <l n="883">Now gaining , now receding , now in act</l>
     <l n="884">To win the summit , now borne down again ,</l>
     <l n="885">And then the inevitable crash — the mass</l>
     <l n="886">Leaping from crag to crag . But ere it ceased</l>
     <l n="887">In dreadful silence , and the low groan came ,</l>
     <l n="888">My limbs were loosed with one convulsive bound ;</l>
     <l n="889">I hid my face within my hands , and fled ,</l>
     <l n="890">Surfeit with horror .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="891">Then it was again</l>
     <l n="892">A woman whom I saw , pitiless , stern ,</l>
     <l n="893">Bearing the brand of blood — a lithe dark form ,</l>
     <l n="894">And cruel eyes which glared beneath the gems</l>
     <l n="895">That argued her a Queen , and on her side</l>
     <l n="896">An ancient stain of gore , which did befoul</l>
     <l n="897">Her royal robe . A murderess in thought</l>
     <l n="898">And dreadful act , who took within the toils</l>
     <l n="899">Her kingly Lord , and slew him of old time</l>
     <l n="900">After burnt Troy . I had no time to speak</l>
     <l n="901">When she shrieked thus :</l>
     <l n="902">“ It doth repent me not</l>
     <l n="903">I would ‘ twere yet to do , and I would do it</l>
     <l n="904">Again a thousand times , if the shed blood</l>
     <l n="905">Might for one hour restore me to the kisses</l>
     <l n="906">Of my AEgisthus . Oh , he was divine ,</l>
     <l n="907">My hero , with the godlike locks and eyes</l>
     <l n="908">Of Eros ’ self ! What boots it that they prate</l>
     <l n="909">Of wifely duty , love of spouse or child ,</l>
     <l n="910">Honour or pity , when the swift fire takes</l>
     <l n="911">A woman 's heart , and burns it out , and leaps</l>
     <l n="912">With fierce forked tongue around it , till it lies</l>
     <l n="913">In ashes , a dead heart , nor aught remains</l>
     <l n="914">Of old affections , naught but the new flame</l>
     <l n="915">Which is unquenched desire ?</l>
     <l n="916">It did not come ,</l>
     <l n="917">My blessing , all at once , but the slow fruit</l>
     <l n="918">Of solitude and midnight loneliness ,</l>
     <l n="919">And weary waiting for the tardy news</l>
     <l n="920">Of taken Troy . Long years I sate alone ,</l>
     <l n="921">Widowed , within my palace , while my Lord</l>
     <l n="922">Was over seas , waging the accursed war ,</l>
     <l n="923">First of the file of Kings . Year after year</l>
     <l n="924">Came false report , or harder , no report</l>
     <l n="925">Of the great fleet . The summers waxed and waned ,</l>
     <l n="926">The wintry surges smote the sounding shores ,</l>
     <l n="927">And yet there came no end of it . They brought</l>
     <l n="928">Now hopeless failure , now great victories ;</l>
     <l n="929">And all alike were false , all but delay</l>
     <l n="930">And hope deferred , which cometh not , but breaks</l>
     <l n="931">The heart which suffering wrings not .</l>
     <l n="932">So I bore</l>
     <l n="933">Long time the solitary years , and sought</l>
     <l n="934">To solace the dull days with motherly cares</l>
     <l n="935">For those my Lord had left me . My firstborn ,</l>
     <l n="936">Iphigeneia , sailed at first with him</l>
     <l n="937">Upon that fatal voyage , but the young</l>
     <l n="938">Orestes and Electra stayed with me —</l>
     <l n="939">Not dear as she was , for the firstborn takes</l>
     <l n="940">The mother 's heart , and , with the milk it draws</l>
     <l n="941">From the mother 's virgin breast , drains all the love</l>
     <l n="942">It bore , ay , even tho ’ the sire be dear ;</l>
     <l n="943">Much more , then , when he is a King indeed ,</l>
     <l n="944">Mighty in war and council , but too high</l>
     <l n="945">To stoop to a woman 's love . But she was gone ,</l>
     <l n="946">Nor heard I tidings of her , knowing not</l>
     <l n="947">If yet she walked the earth , nor if she bare</l>
     <l n="948">The load of children , even as I had borne</l>
     <l n="949">Her in my opening girlhood , when I leapt</l>
     <l n="950">From child to Queen , but never loved the King .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="951">Thus the slow years rolled onward , till at last</l>
     <l n="952">There came a dreadful rumour — ‘ She is dead ,</l>
     <l n="953">Thy daughter , years ago . The cruel priests</l>
     <l n="954">Clamoured for blood ; the stern cold Kings stood round</l>
     <l n="955">Without a tear , and he , her sire , with them ,</l>
     <l n="956">To see a virgin bleed . They cut with knives</l>
     <l n="957">The taper girlish throat ; they watched the blood</l>
     <l n="958">Drip slowly on the sand , and the young life</l>
     <l n="959">Meek as a lamb come to the sacrifice</l>
     <l n="960">To appease the angry gods . ’ And he , the King ,</l>
     <l n="961">Her father , stood by too , and saw them do it ,</l>
     <l n="962">The wickedness , breathing no word of wrath ,</l>
     <l n="963">Till all was done ! The cowards ! the dull cowards !</l>
     <l n="964">I would some black storm , bursting suddenly ,</l>
     <l n="965">Had whelmed them and their fleets , ere yet they dared</l>
     <l n="966">To waste an innocent life !</l>
     <l n="967">I had gone mad ,</l>
     <l n="968">I know it , but for him , my love , my dear ,</l>
     <l n="969">My fair sweet love . He came to comfort me</l>
     <l n="970">With words of friendship , holding that my Lord</l>
     <l n="971">Was bound , perhaps , to let her die — ‘ The gods</l>
     <l n="972">Were ofttimes hard to appease — or was it indeed</l>
     <l n="973">The priests who asked it ? Were there any gods ?</l>
     <l n="974">Or only phantoms , creatures of the brain ,</l>
     <l n="975">Born of the fears of men , the greed of priests ,</l>
     <l n="976">Useful to govern women ? Had he been</l>
     <l n="977">Lord of the fleet , not all the soothsayers</l>
     <l n="978">Who ever frighted cowards should have brought</l>
     <l n="979">His soul to such black depths . ’ I hearkening to him</l>
     <l n="980">As ‘ twere my own thought grown articulate ,</l>
     <l n="981">Found my grief turn to hate , and hate to love —</l>
     <l n="982">Hate of my Lord , love of the voice which spoke</l>
     <l n="983">Such dear and comfortable words . And thus ,</l>
     <l n="984">Love to a storm of passion growing , swept</l>
     <l n="985">My wounded soul and dried my tears , as dries</l>
     <l n="986">The hot sirocco all the bitter pools</l>
     <l n="987">Of salt among the sand . I never knew</l>
     <l n="988">True love before ; I was a child , no more ,</l>
     <l n="989">When the King cast his eyes on me . What is it</l>
     <l n="990">To have borne the weight of offspring ‘ neath the zone ,</l>
     <l n="991">If Love be not their sire ; or live long years</l>
     <l n="992">Of commerce , not of love ? Better a day</l>
     <l n="993">Of Passion than the long unlovely years</l>
     <l n="994">Of wifely duty , when Love cometh not</l>
     <l n="995">To wake the barren days !</l>
     <l n="996">And yet at first</l>
     <l n="997">I hesitated long , nor would embrace</l>
     <l n="998">The blessing that was mine . We are hedged round ,</l>
     <l n="999">We women , by such close-drawn ordinances ,</l>
     <l n="1000">Set round us by our tyrants , that we fear</l>
     <l n="1001">To overstep a hand 's breadth the dull bounds</l>
     <l n="1002">Of custom ; but at last Love , waking in me ,</l>
     <l n="1003">Burst all my chains asunder , and I lived</l>
     <l n="1004">For naught but Love .</l>
     <l n="1005">My son , the young Orestes ,</l>
     <l n="1006">I sent far off ; my girl Electra only</l>
     <l n="1007">Remained , too young to doubt me , and I knew</l>
     <l n="1008">At last what ‘ twas to live .</l>
     <l n="1009">So the swift years</l>
     <l n="1010">Fleeted and found me happy , till the dark</l>
     <l n="1011">Ill-omened day when Rumour , thousand-tongued ,</l>
     <l n="1012">Whispered of taken Troy ; and from my dream</l>
     <l n="1013">Of happiness , sudden I woke , and knew</l>
     <l n="1014">The coming retribution . We had grown</l>
     <l n="1015">Too loving for concealment , and our tale</l>
     <l n="1016">Of mutual love was bruited far and wide</l>
     <l n="1017">Through Argos . All the gossips bruited it ,</l>
     <l n="1018">And were all tongue to tell it to the King</l>
     <l n="1019">When he should come . And should the cold proud Lord</l>
     <l n="1020">I never loved , the murderer of my girl ,</l>
     <l n="1021">Come ‘ twixt my love and me ? A swift resolve</l>
     <l n="1022">Flashed through me pondering on it : Love for Love</l>
     <l n="1023">And Blood for Blood — the simple golden rule</l>
     <l n="1024">Taught by the elder gods .</l>
     <l n="1025">When I had taken</l>
     <l n="1026">My fixed resolve , I grew impatient for it ,</l>
     <l n="1027">Counting the laggard days . Oh , it was sweet</l>
     <l n="1028">To simulate the yearning of a wife</l>
     <l n="1029">Long parted from her Lord , and mock the fools</l>
     <l n="1030">Who dogged each look and word , and but for fear</l>
     <l n="1031">Had torn me from my throne — the pies , the jays ,</l>
     <l n="1032">The impotent chatterers , who thought by words</l>
     <l n="1033">To stay me in the act ! ‘ Twas sweet to mock them</l>
     <l n="1034">And read distrust within their eyes , when I ,</l>
     <l n="1035">Knowing my purpose , bade them quick prepare</l>
     <l n="1036">All fitting honours for the King , and knew</l>
     <l n="1037">They dared not disobey — oh , ‘ twas enough</l>
     <l n="1038">To wing the slow-paced hours .</l>
     <l n="1039">But when at last</l>
     <l n="1040">I saw his sails upon the verge , and then</l>
     <l n="1041">The sea-worn ship , and marked his face grown old ,</l>
     <l n="1042">The body a little bent , which was so straight ,</l>
     <l n="1043">The thin gray hairs which were the raven locks</l>
     <l n="1044">Of manhood when he went , I felt a moment</l>
     <l n="1045">I could not do the deed . But when I saw</l>
     <l n="1046">The beautiful sad woman come with him ,</l>
     <l n="1047">The future in her eyes , and her sad voice</l>
     <l n="1048">Proclaimed the tale of doom , two thoughts at once</l>
     <l n="1049">Assailed me , bidding me despatch with a blow</l>
     <l n="1050">Him and his mistress , making sure the will</l>
     <l n="1051">Of fate , and my revenge .</l>
     <l n="1052">Oh , it was strange</l>
     <l n="1053">To see all happen as we planned ; as ‘ twere</l>
     <l n="1054">Some drama oft rehearsed , wherein each step ,</l>
     <l n="1055">Each word , is so prepared , the poorest player</l>
     <l n="1056">Knows his turn come to do — the solemn landing —</l>
     <l n="1057">The ride to the palace gate — the courtesies</l>
     <l n="1058">Of welcome — the mute crowds without — the bath</l>
     <l n="1059">Prepared within — the precious circling folds</l>
     <l n="1060">Of tissue stretched around him , shutting out</l>
     <l n="1061">The gaze , and folding helpless like a net</l>
     <l n="1062">The mighty limbs — the battle-axe laid down</l>
     <l n="1063">Against the wall , and I , his wife and Queen ,</l>
     <l n="1064">Alone with him , waiting and watching still ,</l>
     <l n="1065">Till the woman shrieked without . Then with swift step</l>
     <l n="1066">I seized the axe , and struck him as he lay</l>
     <l n="1067">Helpless , once , twice , and thrice — once for my girl ,</l>
     <l n="1068">Once for my love , once for the woman , and all</l>
     <l n="1069">For Fate and my Revenge !</l>
     <l n="1070">He gave a groan ,</l>
     <l n="1071">Once only , as I thought he might ; and then</l>
     <l n="1072">No sound but the quick gurgling of the blood ,</l>
     <l n="1073">As it flowed from him in streams , and turned the pure</l>
     <l n="1074">And limpid water of the bath to red —</l>
     <l n="1075">I had not looked for that — it flowed and flowed ,</l>
     <l n="1076">And seemed to madden me to look on it ,</l>
     <l n="1077">Until my love with hands bloody as mine ,</l>
     <l n="1078">But with the woman 's blood , rushed in , and eyes</l>
     <l n="1079">Rounded with horror ; and we turned to go ,</l>
     <l n="1080">And left the dead alone .</l>
     <l n="1081">But happiness</l>
     <l n="1082">Still mocked me , and a doubt unknown before</l>
     <l n="1083">Came on me , and amid the silken shows</l>
     <l n="1084">And luxury of power I seemed to see</l>
     <l n="1085">Another answer to my riddle of life</l>
     <l n="1086">Than that I gave myself , and it was ‘ murder ; ’</l>
     <l n="1087">And in my people 's sullen mien and eyes ,</l>
     <l n="1088">‘ Murder ; ’ and in the mirror , when I looked ,</l>
     <l n="1089">‘ Murder ’ glared out , and terror lest my son</l>
     <l n="1090">Returning , grown to manhood , should avenge</l>
     <l n="1091">His father 's blood . For somehow , as ‘ twould seem ,</l>
     <l n="1092">The gods , if gods there be , or the stern Fate</l>
     <l n="1093">Which doth direct our little lives , do filch</l>
     <l n="1094">Our happiness — though bright with Love 's own ray ,</l>
     <l n="1095">There comes a cloud which veils it . Yet , indeed ,</l>
     <l n="1096">My days were happy . I repent me not ;</l>
     <l n="1097">I would wade through seas of blood to know again</l>
     <l n="1098">Those fierce delights once more .</l>
     <l n="1099">But my young girl</l>
     <l n="1100">Electra , grown to woman , turned from me</l>
     <l n="1101">Her modest maiden eyes , nor loved to set</l>
     <l n="1102">Her kiss upon my cheek , but , all distraught</l>
     <l n="1103">With secret care , hid her from all the pomps</l>
     <l n="1104">And revelries which did befit her youth ,</l>
     <l n="1105">Walking alone ; and often at the tomb</l>
     <l n="1106">Of her lost sire they found her , pouring out</l>
     <l n="1107">Libations to the dead . And evermore</l>
     <l n="1108">I did bethink me of my son Orestes ,</l>
     <l n="1109">Who now should be a man ; and yearned sometimes</l>
     <l n="1110">To see his face , yet feared lest from his eyes</l>
     <l n="1111">His father 's soul should smite me .</l>
     <l n="1112">So I lived</l>
     <l n="1113">Happy and yet unquiet — a stern voice</l>
     <l n="1114">Speaking of doom , which long time softer notes</l>
     <l n="1115">Of careless weal , the music that doth spring</l>
     <l n="1116">From the fair harmonies of life and love ,</l>
     <l n="1117">Would drown in their own concord . This at times</l>
     <l n="1118">Nay , day by day , stronger and dreadfuller ,</l>
     <l n="1119">With dominant accent , marred the sounds of joy</l>
     <l n="1120">By one prevailing discord . So at length</l>
     <l n="1121">I came to lose the Present in the dread</l>
     <l n="1122">Of what might come ; the penalty that waits</l>
     <l n="1123">Upon successful sin ; who , having sinned ,</l>
     <l n="1124">Had missed my sin 's reward .</l>
     <l n="1125">Until one day</l>
     <l n="1126">I , looking from my palace casement , saw</l>
     <l n="1127">A humble suppliant , clad in pilgrim garb ,</l>
     <l n="1128">Approach the marble stair . A sudden throb</l>
     <l n="1129">Thrilled thro ’ me , and the mother 's heart went forth</l>
     <l n="1130">Thro ’ all disguise of garb and rank and years ,</l>
     <l n="1131">Knowing my son . How fair he was , how tall</l>
     <l n="1132">And vigorous , my boy ! What strong straight limbs</l>
     <l n="1133">And noble port ! How beautiful the shade</l>
     <l n="1134">Of manhood on his lip ! I longed to burst</l>
     <l n="1135">From my chamber down , yearning to throw myself</l>
     <l n="1136">Upon his neck within the palace court ,</l>
     <l n="1137">Before the guards — spurning my queenly rank ,</l>
     <l n="1138">All but my motherhood . And then a chill</l>
     <l n="1139">Of doubt o'erspread me , knowing what a gulf</l>
     <l n="1140">Fate set between our lives , impassable</l>
     <l n="1141">As that great gulf which yawns ‘ twixt life and death</l>
     <l n="1142">And ‘ twixt this Hell and Heaven . I shrank back ,</l>
     <l n="1143">And turned to think a moment , half in fear ,</l>
     <l n="1144">And half in pain ; dividing the swift mind ,</l>
     <l n="1145">Yet all in love .</l>
     <l n="1146">Then came a cry , a groan ,</l>
     <l n="1147">From the inner court , the clash of swords , the fall</l>
     <l n="1148">Of a body on the pavement ; and one cried ,</l>
     <l n="1149">‘ The King is dead , slain by the young Orestes ,</l>
     <l n="1150">Who cometh hither . ’ With the word , the door</l>
     <l n="1151">Flew open , and my son stood straight before me ,</l>
     <l n="1152">His drawn sword dripping blood . Oh , he was fair</l>
     <l n="1153">And terrible to see , when from his limbs ,</l>
     <l n="1154">The suppliant 's mantle fallen , left the mail</l>
     <l n="1155">And arms of a young warrior . Love and Hate ,</l>
     <l n="1156">Which are the offspring of a common sire ,</l>
     <l n="1157">Strove for the mastery , till within his eyes</l>
     <l n="1158">I saw his father 's ghost glare unappeased</l>
     <l n="1159">From out Love 's casements .</l>
     <l n="1160">Then I knew my fate</l>
     <l n="1161">And his — mine to be slain by my son 's hand ,</l>
     <l n="1162">And his to slay me , since the Furies drave</l>
     <l n="1163">Our lives to one destruction ; and I took</l>
     <l n="1164">His point within my breast .</l>
     <l n="1165">But I praise not</l>
     <l n="1166">The selfish , careless gods who wrecked our lives ,</l>
     <l n="1167">Making the King the murderer of his girl ,</l>
     <l n="1168">And me his murderess ; making my son</l>
     <l n="1169">The murderer of his mother and her love —</l>
     <l n="1170">A mystery of blood !— I curse them all ,</l>
     <l n="1171">The careless Forces , sitting far withdrawn</l>
     <l n="1172">Upon the heights of Space , taking men 's lives</l>
     <l n="1173">For playthings , and deriding as in sport</l>
     <l n="1174">Our happiness and woe — I curse them all .</l>
     <l n="1175">We have a right to joy ; we have a right ,</l>
     <l n="1176">I say , as they have . Let them stand confessed</l>
     <l n="1177">The puppets that they are — too weak to give</l>
     <l n="1178">The good they feign to love , since Fate , too strong</l>
     <l n="1179">For them as us , beyond their painted sky ,</l>
     <l n="1180">Sits and derides them , too . I curse Fate too ,</l>
     <l n="1181">The deaf blind Fury , taking human souls</l>
     <l n="1182">And crushing them , as a dull fretful child</l>
     <l n="1183">Crushes its toys and knows not with what skill</l>
     <l n="1184">Those feeble forms are feigned .</l>
     <l n="1185">I curse , I loathe ,</l>
     <l n="1186">I spit on them . It doth repent me not .</l>
     <l n="1187">I would ‘ twere yet to do . I have lived my life .</l>
     <l n="1188">I have loved . See , there he lies within the bath ,</l>
     <l n="1189">And thus I smite him ! thus ! Didst hear him groan ?</l>
     <l n="1190">Oh , vengeance , thou art sweet ! What , living still ?</l>
     <l n="1191">Ah me ! we cannot die ! Come , torture me ,</l>
     <l n="1192">Ye Furies — for I love not soothing words —</l>
     <l n="1193">As once ye did my son . Ye miserable</l>
     <l n="1194">Blind ministers of Hell , I do defy you ;</l>
     <l n="1195">Not all your torments can undo the Past</l>
     <l n="1196">Of Passion and of Love ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="1197">Even as she spake</l>
     <l n="1198">There came a viewless trouble in the air ,</l>
     <l n="1199">Which took her , and a sweep of wings unseen ,</l>
     <l n="1200">And terrible sounds , which swooped on her and hushed</l>
     <l n="1201">Her voice , and seemed to occupy her soul</l>
     <l n="1202">With horror and despair ; and as she passed</l>
     <l n="1203">I marked her agonized eyes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="1204">But as I went ,</l>
     <l n="1205">Full many a dreadful shape of lonely pain</l>
     <l n="1206">I saw . What need to tell them ? We are filled</l>
     <l n="1207">Who live to-day with a more present sense</l>
     <l n="1208">Of the great love of God , than those of old</l>
     <l n="1209">Who , groping in the dawn of Knowledge , saw</l>
     <l n="1210">Only dark shadows of the Unknown ; or he ,</l>
     <l n="1211">First-born of modern singers , who swept deep</l>
     <l n="1212">His awful lyre , and woke the voice of song ,</l>
     <l n="1213">Dumb for long centuries of pain . We dread</l>
     <l n="1214">To dwell on those long agonies its sin</l>
     <l n="1215">Brings on the offending soul ; who hold a creed</l>
     <l n="1216">Of deeper Pity , knowing what chains of ill</l>
     <l n="1217">Bind round our petty lives . Each phase of woe ,</l>
     <l n="1218">Suffering , and torture which the gloomy thought</l>
     <l n="1219">Of bigots feigns for others — all were there .</l>
     <l n="1220">One there was stretched upon a rolling wheel ,</l>
     <l n="1221">Which was the barren round of sense , that still</l>
     <l n="1222">Returned upon itself and broke the limbs</l>
     <l n="1223">Bound to it day and night . Others I saw</l>
     <l n="1224">Doomed , with unceasing toil , to fill the urns</l>
     <l n="1225">Whose precious waters sank ere they could slake</l>
     <l n="1226">Their burning thirst . Another shapeless soul ,</l>
     <l n="1227">Full of revolts and hates and tyrannous force ,</l>
     <l n="1228">The weight of earth , which was its earth-born taint ,</l>
     <l n="1229">Pressed groaning down , while with fierce beak and claw</l>
     <l n="1230">The vulture of remorse , piercing his breast ,</l>
     <l n="1231">Preyed on his heart . For others , overhead ,</l>
     <l n="1232">Great crags of rock impending seemed to fall ,</l>
     <l n="1233">But fell not nor brought peace . I felt my soul</l>
     <l n="1234">Blunted with horrors , yearning to escape</l>
     <l n="1235">To where , upon the limits of the wood ,</l>
     <l n="1236">Some scanty twilight grew .</l>
     <l n="1237">But ere I passed</l>
     <l n="1238">From those grim shades a deep voice sounded near ,</l>
     <l n="1239">A voice without a form .</l>
     <l n="1240">“ There is an end</l>
     <l n="1241">Of all things that thou seest ! There is an end</l>
     <l n="1242">Of Wrong and Death and Hell ! When the long wear</l>
     <l n="1243">Of Time and Suffering has effaced the stain</l>
     <l n="1244">Ingrown upon the soul , and the cleansed spirit ,</l>
     <l n="1245">Long ages floating on the wandering winds</l>

     <l n="1247">And doth regain its dwelling , and , once more</l>

     <l n="1249">Upon the stream of Things ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>and comes at length ,</l>
     <l n="1250">After new deaths , to that dim waiting-place</l>

     <l n="1257">Even as I heard ,</l>

     <l n="1">Then from those dark</l>
     <l n="2">And dreadful precincts passing , ghostly fields</l>
     <l n="3">And voiceless took me . A faint twilight veiled</l>
     <l n="4">The leafless , shadowy trees and herbless plains .</l>
     <l n="5">There stirred no breath of air to wake to life</l>
     <l n="6">The slumbers of the world . The sky above</l>
     <l n="7">Was one gray , changeless cloud . There looked no eye</l>
     <l n="8">Of Life from the veiled heavens ; but Sleep and Death</l>
     <l n="9">Were round me everywhere . And yet no fear</l>
     <l n="10">Nor horror took me here , where was no pain</l>
     <l n="11">Nor dread , save that strange tremor which assails</l>
     <l n="12">One who in life 's hot noontide looks on death</l>
     <l n="13">And knows he too shall die . The ghosts which rose</l>
     <l n="14">From every darkling copse showed thin and pale —</l>
     <l n="15">Thinner and paler far than those I left</l>
     <l n="16">In agony ; even as Pity seems to wear</l>
     <l n="17">A thinner form than Fear .</l>
     <l n="18">Not caged alone</l>
     <l n="19">Like those the avenging Furies purged were these ,</l>
     <l n="20">Nor that dim land as those black cavernous depths</l>
     <l n="21">Where no hope comes . Fair souls were they and white</l>
     <l n="22">Whom there I saw , waiting as we shall wait ,</l>
     <l n="23">The Beatific End , but thin and pale</l>
     <l n="24">As the young faith which made them ; touched a little</l>
     <l n="25">By the sad memories of the earth ; made glad</l>
     <l n="26">A little by past joys : no more ; and wrapt</l>
     <l n="27">In musing on the brief play played by them</l>
     <l n="28">Upon the lively earth , yet ignorant</l>
     <l n="29">Of the long lapse of years , and what had been</l>
     <l n="30">Since they too breathed Life 's air , or if they knew ,</l>
     <l n="31">Keeping some echo only ; but their pain</l>
     <l n="32">Was fainter than their joy , and a great hope</l>
     <l n="33">Like ours possessed them dimly .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="34">First I saw</l>
     <l n="35">A youth who pensive leaned against the trunk</l>
     <l n="36">Of a dark cypress , and an idle flute</l>
     <l n="37">Hung at his side . A sorrowful sad soul ,</l>
     <l n="38">Such as sometimes he knows , who meets the gaze ,</l>
     <l n="39">Mute , uncomplaining yet most pitiful ,</l>
     <l n="40">Of one whom nature , by some secret spite ,</l>
     <l n="41">Has maimed and left imperfect ; or the pain</l>
     <l n="42">Which fills a poet 's eyes . Beneath his robe</l>
     <l n="43">I seemed to see the scar of cruel stripes ,</l>
     <l n="44">Too hastily concealed . Yet was he not</l>
     <l n="45">Wholly unhappy , but from out the core</l>
     <l n="46">Of suffering flowed a secret spring of joy ,</l>
     <l n="47">Which mocked the droughts of Fate , and left him glad</l>
     <l n="48">And glorying in his sorrow . As I gazed</l>
     <l n="49">He raised his silent flute , and , half ashamed ,</l>
     <l n="50">Blew a soft note ; and as I stayed awhile</l>
     <l n="51">I heard him thus discourse —</l>
     <l n="52">“ The flute is sweet</l>
     <l n="53">To gods and men , but sweeter far the lyre</l>
     <l n="54">And voice of a true singer . Shall I fear</l>
     <l n="55">To tell of that great trial , when I strove</l>
     <l n="56">And Phoebus conquered ? Nay , no shame it is</l>
     <l n="57">To bow to an immortal melody ;</l>
     <l n="58">But glory .</l>
     <l n="59">Once among the Phrygian hills</l>
     <l n="60">I lay a-musing ,— while the silly sheep</l>
     <l n="61">Wandered among the thyme — upon the bank</l>
     <l n="62">Of a clear mountain stream , beneath the pines ,</l>
     <l n="63">Safe hidden from the noon . A dreamy haze</l>
     <l n="64">Played on the uplands , but the hills were clear</l>
     <l n="65">In sunlight , and no cloud was on the sky .</l>
     <l n="66">It was the time when a deep silence comes</l>
     <l n="67">Upon the summer earth , and all the birds</l>
     <l n="68">Have ceased from singing , and the world is still</l>
     <l n="69">As midnight , and if any live thing move —</l>
     <l n="70">Some fur-clad creature , or cool gliding snake —</l>
     <l n="71">Within the pipy overgrowth of weeds ,</l>
     <l n="72">The ear can catch the rustle , and the trees</l>
     <l n="73">And earth and air are listening . As I lay ,</l>
     <l n="74">Faintly , as in a dream , I seemed to hear</l>
     <l n="75">A tender music , like the AEolian chords ,</l>
     <l n="76">Sound low within the woodland , whence the stream ,</l>
     <l n="77">Flowed full , yet silent . Long , with ear to ground ,</l>
     <l n="78">I hearkened ; and the sweet strain , fuller grown ,</l>
     <l n="79">Rounder and clearer came , and danced along</l>
     <l n="80">In mirthful measure now , and now grown grave</l>
     <l n="81">In dying falls , and sweeter and more clear ,</l>
     <l n="82">Tripping at nuptials and high revelry ,</l>
     <l n="83">Wailing at burials , rapt in soaring thoughts ,</l>
     <l n="84">Chanting strange sea-tales full of mystery ,</l>
     <l n="85">Touching all chords of being , and life and death ,</l>
     <l n="86">Now rose , now sank , and always was divine ,</l>
     <l n="87">So strange the music came .</l>
     <l n="88">Till , as I lay</l>
     <l n="89">Enraptured , swift a sudden discord rang ,</l>
     <l n="90">And all the sound grew still . A sudden flash ,</l>
     <l n="91">As from a sunlit jewel , fired the wood .</l>
     <l n="92">A noise of water smitten , and on the hills</l>
     <l n="93">A fair white fleece of cloud , which swiftly climbed</l>
     <l n="94">Into the farthest heaven . Then , as I mused ,</l>
     <l n="95">Knowing a parting goddess , straight I saw</l>
     <l n="96">A sudden splendour float upon the stream ,</l>
     <l n="97">And knew it for this jewelled flute , which paused</l>
     <l n="98">Before me on an eddy . It I snatched</l>
     <l n="99">Eager , and to my ardent lips I bore</l>
     <l n="100">The wonder , and behold , with the first breath —</l>
     <l n="101">The first warm human breath , the silent strains .</l>
     <l n="102">The half-drowned notes which late the goddess blew ,</l>
     <l n="103">Revived , and sounded clearer , sweeter far</l>
     <l n="104">Than mortal skill could make . So with delight</l>
     <l n="105">I left my flocks to wander o'er the wastes</l>
     <l n="106">Untended , and the wolves and eagles seized</l>
     <l n="107">The tender lambs , but I was for my art —</l>
     <l n="108">Nought else ; and though the high-pitched notes divine</l>
     <l n="109">Grew faint , yet something lingered , and at last</l>
     <l n="110">So sweet a note I sounded of my skill ,</l>
     <l n="111">That all the Phrygian highlands , all the white</l>
     <l n="112">Hill villages , were fain to hear the strain ,</l>
     <l n="113">Which the mad shepherd made .</l>
     <l n="114">So , overbold ,</l>
     <l n="115">And rapt in my new art , at last I dared</l>
     <l n="116">To challenge Phoebus ’ self .</l>
     <l n="117">‘ Twas a fair day</l>
     <l n="118">When sudden , on the mountain side , I saw</l>
     <l n="119">A train of fleecy clouds in a white band</l>
     <l n="120">Descending . Down the gleaming pinnacles</l>
     <l n="121">And difficult crags they floated , and the arch ,</l>
     <l n="122">Drawn with its thousand rays against the sun ,</l>
     <l n="123">Hung like a glory o'er them . Midst the pines</l>
     <l n="124">They clothed themselves with form , and straight I knew</l>
     <l n="125">The immortals . Young Apollo , with his lyre ,</l>
     <l n="126">Kissed by the sun , and all the Muses clad</l>
     <l n="127">In robes of gleaming white ; then a great fear ,</l>
     <l n="128">Yet mixed with joy , assailed me , for I knew</l>
     <l n="129">Myself a mortal equalled with the gods .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="130">Ah me ! how fair they were ! how fair and dread</l>
     <l n="131">In face and form , they showed , when now they came</l>
     <l n="132">Upon the thymy slope , and the young god</l>
     <l n="133">Lay with his choir around him , beautiful</l>
     <l n="134">And bold as Youth and Dawn ! There was no cloud</l>
     <l n="135">Upon the sky , nor any sound at all</l>
     <l n="136">When I began my strain . No coward fear</l>
     <l n="137">Of what might come restrained me ; but an awe</l>
     <l n="138">Of those immortal eyes and ears divine</l>
     <l n="139">Looking and listening . All the earth seemed full</l>
     <l n="140">Of ears for me alone — the woods , the fields ,</l>
     <l n="141">The hills , the skies were listening . Scarce a sound</l>
     <l n="142">My flute might make ; such subtle harmonies</l>
     <l n="143">The silence seemed to weave round me and flout</l>
     <l n="144">The half unuttered thought . Till last I blew ,</l>
     <l n="145">As now , a hesitating note , and lo !</l>
     <l n="146">The breath divine , lingering on mortal lips ,</l>
     <l n="147">Hurried my soul along to such fair rhymes ,</l>
     <l n="148">Sweeter than wont , that swift I knew my life</l>
     <l n="149">Rise up within me , and expand , and all</l>
     <l n="150">The human , which so nearly is divine ,</l>
     <l n="151">Was glorified , and on the Muses ’ lips ,</l>
     <l n="152">And in their lovely eyes , I saw a fair</l>
     <l n="153">Approval , and my soul in me was glad .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="154">For all the strains I blew were strains of love —</l>
     <l n="155">Love striving , love triumphant , love that lies</l>
     <l n="156">Within beloved arms , and wreathes his locks</l>
     <l n="157">With flowers , and lets the world go by and sings</l>
     <l n="158">Unheeding ; and I saw a kindly gleam</l>
     <l n="159">Within the Muses ’ eyes , who were indeed ,</l>
     <l n="160">Women , though god-like .</l>
     <l n="161">But upon the face</l>
     <l n="162">Of the young Sun-god only haughty scorn</l>
     <l n="163">Sate and he swiftly struck his golden lyre ,</l>
     <l n="164">And played the Song of Life ; and lo , I knew</l>
     <l n="165">My strain , how earthy ! Oh , to hear the young</l>
     <l n="166">Apollo playing ! and the hidden cells</l>
     <l n="167">And chambers of the universe displayed</l>
     <l n="168">Before the charmed sound ! I seemed to float</l>
     <l n="169">In some enchanted cave , where the wave dips</l>
     <l n="170">In from the sunlit sea , and floods its depths</l>
     <l n="171">With reflex hues of heaven . My soul was rapt</l>
     <l n="172">By that I heard , and dared to wish no more</l>
     <l n="173">For victory ; and yet because the sound</l>
     <l n="174">Of music that is born of human breath</l>
     <l n="175">Comes straighter from the soul than any strain</l>
     <l n="176">The hand alone can make ; therefore I knew ,</l>
     <l n="177">With a mixed thrill of pity and delight ,</l>
     <l n="178">The nine immortal Sisters hardly touched</l>
     <l n="179">By this fine strain of music , as by mine ,</l>
     <l n="180">And when the high lay trembled to its close ,</l>
     <l n="181">Still doubting .</l>
     <l n="182">Then upon the Sun-god 's face</l>
     <l n="183">There passed a cold proud smile . He swept his lyre</l>
     <l n="184">Once more , then laid it down , and with clear voice ,</l>
     <l n="185">The voice of godhead , sang . Oh , ecstasy ,</l>
     <l n="186">Oh happiness of him who once has heard</l>
     <l n="187">Apollo singing ! For his ears the sound</l>
     <l n="188">Of grosser music dies , and all the earth</l>
     <l n="189">Is full of subtle undertones , which change</l>
     <l n="190">The listener and transform him . As he sang —</l>
     <l n="191">Of what I know not , but the music touched</l>
     <l n="192">Each chord of being — I felt my secret life</l>
     <l n="193">Stand open to it , as the parched earth yawns</l>
     <l n="194">To drink the summer rain ; and at the call</l>
     <l n="195">Of those refreshing waters , all my thought</l>
     <l n="196">Stir from its dark and secret depths , and burst</l>
     <l n="197">Into sweet , odorous flowers , and from their wells</l>
     <l n="198">Deep call to deep , and all the mystery</l>
     <l n="199">Of all that is , laid open . As he sang ,</l>
     <l n="200">I saw the Nine , with lovely pitying eyes ,</l>
     <l n="201">Sign ‘ He has conquered . ’ Yet I felt no pang</l>
     <l n="202">Of fear , only deep joy that I had heard</l>
     <l n="203">Such music while I lived , even though it brought</l>
     <l n="204">Torture and death . For what were it to lie</l>
     <l n="205">Sleek , crowned with roses , drinking vulgar praise ,</l>
     <l n="206">And surfeited with offerings , the dull gift</l>
     <l n="207">Of ignorant hands — all which I might have known —</l>
     <l n="208">To this diviner failure ? Godlike ‘ tis</l>
     <l n="209">To climb upon the icy ledge , and fall</l>
     <l n="210">Where other footsteps dare not . So I knew</l>
     <l n="211">My fate , and it was near .</l>
     <l n="212">For to a pine</l>
     <l n="213">They bound me willing , and with cruel stripes</l>
     <l n="214">Tore me , and took my life .</l>
     <l n="215">But from my blood</l>
     <l n="216">Was born the stream of song , and on its flow</l>
     <l n="217">My poor flute , to the cool swift river borne ,</l>
     <l n="218">Floated , and thence adown a lordlier tide</l>
     <l n="219">Into the deep , wide sea . I do not blame</l>
     <l n="220">Phoebus , or Nature which has set this bar</l>
     <l n="221">Betwixt success and failure , for I know</l>
     <l n="222">How far high failure overleaps the bound</l>
     <l n="223">Of low successes . Only suffering draws</l>
     <l n="224">The inner heart of song and can elicit</l>
     <l n="225">The perfumes of the soul . ‘ Twere not enough</l>
     <l n="226">To fail , for that were happiness to him</l>
     <l n="227">Who ever upward looks with reverent eye</l>
     <l n="228">And seeks but to admire . So , since the race</l>
     <l n="229">Of bards soars highest ; as who seek to show</l>
     <l n="230">Our lives as in a glass ; therefore it comes</l>
     <l n="231">That suffering weds with song , from him of old ,</l>
     <l n="232">Who solaced his blank darkness with his verse ;</l>
     <l n="233">Through all the story of neglect and scorn ,</l>
     <l n="234">Necessity , sheer hunger , early death ,</l>
     <l n="235">Which smite the singer still . Not only those</l>
     <l n="236">Who keep clear accents of the voice divine</l>
     <l n="237">Are honourable — they are happy , indeed ,</l>
     <l n="238">Whate'er the world has held — but those who hear</l>
     <l n="239">Some fair faint echoes , though the crowd be deaf ,</l>
     <l n="240">And see the white gods ’ garments on the hills ,</l>
     <l n="241">Which the crowd sees not , though they may not find</l>
     <l n="242">Fit music for their thought ; they too are blest ,</l>
     <l n="243">Not pitiable . Not from arrogant pride</l>
     <l n="244">Nor over-boldness fail they who have striven</l>
     <l n="245">To tell what they have heard , with voice too weak</l>
     <l n="246">For such high message . More it is than ease ,</l>
     <l n="247">Palace and pomp , honours and luxuries ,</l>
     <l n="248">To have seen white Presences upon the hills ,</l>
     <l n="249">To have heard the voices of the Eternal Gods . ”</l>

     <l n="461">With such deep characters upon our lives ,</l>
     <l n="462">That all the rest are blotted . In this place ,</l>
     <l n="463">Where is not action , thought , or count of time ,</l>
     <l n="464">It is not weary as it were on earth ,</l>
     <l n="465">To dwell on these old memories . Time is born</l>
     <l n="466">Of dawns and sunsets , days that wax and wane</l>
     <l n="467">And stamp themselves upon the yielding face</l>
     <l n="468">Of fleeting human life ; but here there is</l>
     <l n="469">Morning nor evening , act nor suffering ,</l>
     <l n="470">But only one unchanging Present holds</l>
     <l n="471">Our being suspended . One blest day indeed ,</l>
     <l n="472">Or centuries ago or yesterday ,</l>
     <l n="473">There came among us one who was Divine ,</l>
     <l n="474">Not as our gods , joyous and breathing strength</l>
     <l n="475">And careless life , but crowned with a new crown</l>
     <l n="476">Of suffering , and a great light came with him ,</l>
     <l n="477">And with him he brought Time and a new sense</l>
     <l n="478">Of dim , long-vanished years ; and since he passed</l>
     <l n="479">I seem to see new meaning in my fate ,</l>
     <l n="480">And all the deeds I tell of . Evermore</l>
     <l n="481">The young life comes , bound to the cruel rocks</l>
     <l n="482">Alone . Before it the unfathomed sea</l>
     <l n="483">Smiles , filled with monstrous growths that wait to take</l>
     <l n="484">Its innocence . Far off the voice and hand</l>
     <l n="485">Of love kneel by in agony , and entreat</l>
     <l n="486">The seeming careless gods . Still when the deep</l>
     <l n="487">Is smoothest , lo , the deadly fangs and coils</l>
     <l n="488">Lurk near , to smite with death . And o'er the crags</l>
     <l n="489">Of duty , like a sudden sunbeam , springs</l>
     <l n="490">Some golden soul half mortal , half divine ,</l>
     <l n="491">Heaven-sent , and breaks the chain ; and evermore</l>
     <l n="492">For sacrifice they die , through sacrifice</l>
     <l n="493">They live , and are for others , and no grief</l>
     <l n="494">Which smites the humblest but reverberates</l>
     <l n="495">Thro ’ all the close-set files of life , and takes</l>
     <l n="496">The princely soul that from its royal towers</l>
     <l n="497">Looks down and sees the sorrow .</l>
     <l n="498">Sir , farewell !</l>
     <l n="499">If thou shouldst meet my children on the earth</l>
     <l n="500">Or here , for maybe it is long ago</l>
     <l n="501">Since I and they were living , say to them</l>
     <l n="502">I only muse a little here , and wait</l>
     <l n="503">The waking . ”</l>
     <l n="504">And her lifted arms sank down</l>
     <l n="505">Upon her knees , and as I passed I saw her</l>
     <l n="506">Gazing with soft rapt eyes , and on her lips</l>
     <l n="507">A smile as of a saint .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="508">And then I saw</l>
     <l n="509">A manly hunter pace along the lea ,</l>
     <l n="510">His bow upon his shoulder , and his spear</l>
     <l n="511">Poised idly in his hand : the face and form</l>
     <l n="512">Of vigorous youth ; but in the full brown eyes</l>
     <l n="513">A timorous gaze as of a hunted hart ,</l>
     <l n="514">Brute-like , yet human still , even as the Faun</l>
     <l n="515">Of old , the dumb brute passing into man ,</l>
     <l n="516">And dowered with double nature . As he came</l>
     <l n="517">I seemed to question of his fate , and he</l>
     <l n="518">Answered me thus :</l>
     <l n="519">“ ‘ Twas one hot afternoon</l>
     <l n="520">That I , a hunter , wearied with my day ,</l>
     <l n="521">Heard my hounds baying fainter on the hills ,</l>
     <l n="522">Led by the flying hart ; and when the sound</l>
     <l n="523">Faded and all was still , I turned to seek ,</l>
     <l n="524">O'ercome by heat and thirst , a little glade ,</l>
     <l n="525">Beloved of old , where , in the shadowy wood ,</l>
     <l n="526">The clear cold crystal of a mossy pool</l>
     <l n="527">Lipped the soft emerald marge , and gave again</l>
     <l n="528">The flower-starred lawn where ofttimes overspent</l>
     <l n="529">I lay upon the grass and careless bathed</l>
     <l n="530">My limbs in the sweet lymph .</l>
     <l n="531">But as I neared</l>
     <l n="532">The hollow , sudden through the leaves I saw</l>
     <l n="533">A throng of wood-nymphs fair , sporting undraped</l>
     <l n="534">Round one , a goddess . She with timid hand</l>
     <l n="535">Loosened her zone , and glancing round let fall</l>
     <l n="536">Her robe from neck and bosom , pure and bright ,</l>
     <l n="537">( For it was Dian 's self I saw , none else )</l>
     <l n="538">As when she frees her from a fleece of cloud</l>
     <l n="539">And swims along the deep blue sea of heaven</l>
     <l n="540">On sweet June nights . Silent awhile I stood ,</l>
     <l n="541">Rooted with awe , and fain had turned to fly ,</l>
     <l n="542">But feared by careless footstep to affright</l>
     <l n="543">Those chaste cold eyes . Great awe and reverence</l>
     <l n="544">Held me , and fear ; then Love with passing wing</l>
     <l n="545">Fanned me , and held my eyes , and checked my breath ,</l>
     <l n="546">Signing ‘ Beware ! ’</l>
     <l n="547">So for a time I watched ,</l>
     <l n="548">Breathless as one a brooding nightmare holds ,</l>
     <l n="549">Who fleeth some great fear , yet fleeth not ;</l>
     <l n="550">Till the last flutter of lawn , and veil no more</l>
     <l n="551">Obscured , and all the beauty of my dreams</l>
     <l n="552">Assailed my sense . But ere I raised my eyes ,</l>
     <l n="553">As one who fain would look and see the sun ,</l>
     <l n="554">The first glance dazed my brain . Only I knew</l>
     <l n="555">The perfect outline flow in tender curves ,</l>
     <l n="556">To break in doubled charms ; only a haze</l>
     <l n="557">Of creamy white , dimple , and deep divine :</l>
     <l n="558">And then no more . For lo ! a sudden chill ,</l>
     <l n="559">And such thick mist as shuts the hills at eve ,</l>
     <l n="560">Oppressed me gazing ; and a heaven-sent shame ,</l>
     <l n="561">An awe , a fear , a reverence for the unknown ,</l>
     <l n="562">Froze all the springs of will and left me cold ,</l>
     <l n="563">And blinded all the longings of my eyes ,</l>
     <l n="564">Leaving such dim reflection still as mocks</l>
     <l n="565">Him who has looked on a great light , and keeps</l>
     <l n="566">On his closed eyes the image . Presently ,</l>
     <l n="567">My fainting soul , safe hidden for awhile</l>
     <l n="568">Deep in Life 's mystic shades , renewed herself ,</l>
     <l n="569">And straight , the innocent brute within the man</l>
     <l n="570">Bore on me , and with half-averted eye</l>
     <l n="571">I gazed upon the secret .</l>
     <l n="572">As I looked ,</l>
     <l n="573">A radiance , white as beamed the frosty moon</l>
     <l n="574">On the mad boy and slew him , beamed on me ;</l>
     <l n="575">Made chill my pulses , checked my life and heat ;</l>
     <l n="576">Transformed me , withered all my soul , and left</l>
     <l n="577">My being burnt out . For lo ! the dreadful eyes</l>
     <l n="578">Of Godhead met my gaze , and through the mask</l>
     <l n="579">And thick disguise of sense , as through a wood ,</l>
     <l n="580">Pierced to my life . Then suddenly I knew</l>
     <l n="581">An altered nature , touched by no desire</l>
     <l n="582">For that which showed so lovely , but declined</l>
     <l n="583">To lower levels . Nought of fear or awe ,</l>
     <l n="584">Nothing of love was mine . Wide-eyed I gazed ,</l>
     <l n="585">But saw no spiritual beam to blight</l>
     <l n="586">My brain with too much beauty , no undraped</l>
     <l n="587">And awful majesty ; only a brute ,</l>
     <l n="588">Dumb charm , like that which draws the brute to it ,</l>
     <l n="589">Unknowing it is drawn . So gradually</l>
     <l n="590">I knew a dull content o'ercloud my sense ,</l>
     <l n="591">And unabashed I gazed , like that dumb bird</l>
     <l n="592">Which thinks no thought and speaks no word , yet fronts</l>
     <l n="593">The sun that blinded Homer — all my fear</l>
     <l n="594">Sunk with my shame , in a base happiness .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="595">But as I gazed , and careless turned and passed</l>
     <l n="596">Through the thick wood , forgetting what had been ,</l>
     <l n="597">And thinking thoughts no longer , swift there came</l>
     <l n="598">A mortal terror : voices that I knew ,</l>
     <l n="599">My own hounds ’ bayings that I loved before ,</l>
     <l n="600">As with them often o'er the purple hills</l>
     <l n="601">I chased the flying hart from slope to slope ,</l>
     <l n="602">Before the slow sun climbed the Eastern peaks ,</l>
     <l n="603">Until the swift sun smote the Western plain ;</l>
     <l n="604">Whom often I had cheered by voice and glance ,</l>
     <l n="605">Whom often I had checked with hand and thong</l>
     <l n="606">Grim followers , like the passions , firing me ,</l>
     <l n="607">True servants , like the strong nerves , urging me</l>
     <l n="608">On many a fruitless chase , to find and take</l>
     <l n="609">Some too swift-fleeting beauty ; faithful feet</l>
     <l n="610">And tongues , obedient always : these I knew ,</l>
     <l n="611">Clothed with a new-born force and vaster grown ,</l>
     <l n="612">And stronger than their master ; and I thought ,</l>
     <l n="613">What if they tare me with their jaws , nor knew</l>
     <l n="614">That once I ruled them ,— brute pursuing brute ,</l>
     <l n="615">And I the quarry ? Then I turned and fled ,—</l>
     <l n="616">If it was I indeed that feared and fled —</l>
     <l n="617">Down the long glades , and through the tangled brakes ,</l>
     <l n="618">Where scarce the sunlight pierced ; fled on and on ,</l>
     <l n="619">And panted , self-pursued . But evermore</l>
     <l n="620">The dissonant music which I knew so sweet ,</l>
     <l n="621">When by the windy hills , the echoing vales ,</l>
     <l n="622">And whispering pines it rang , now far , now near ,</l>
     <l n="623">As from my rushing steed I leant and cheered</l>
     <l n="624">With voice and horn the chase — this brought to me</l>
     <l n="625">Fear of I knew not what , which bade me fly ,</l>
     <l n="626">Fly always , fly ; but when my heart stood still ,</l>
     <l n="627">And all my limbs were stiffened as I fled ,</l>
     <l n="628">Just as the white moon ghost-like climbed the sky ,</l>
     <l n="629">Nearer they came and nearer , baying loud ,</l>
     <l n="630">With bloodshot eyes and red jaws dripping foam ;</l>
     <l n="631">And when I strove to check their savagery ,</l>
     <l n="632">Speaking with words ; no voice articulate came ,</l>
     <l n="633">Only a dumb , low bleat . Then all the throng</l>
     <l n="634">Leapt swift on me , and tare me as I lay ,</l>
     <l n="635">And left me man again .</l>
     <l n="636">Wherefore I walk</l>
     <l n="637">Along these dim fields peopled with the ghosts</l>
     <l n="638">Of heroes who have left the ways of earth</l>
     <l n="639">For this faint ghost of them . Sometimes I think ,</l>
     <l n="640">Pondering on what has been , that all my days</l>
     <l n="641">Were shadows , all my life an allegory ;</l>
     <l n="642">And , though I know sometimes some fainter gleam</l>
     <l n="643">Of the old beauty move me , and sometimes</l>
     <l n="644">Some beat of the old pulses ; that my fate ,</l>
     <l n="645">For ever hurrying on in hot pursuit ,</l>
     <l n="646">To fall at length self-slain , was but a tale</l>
     <l n="647">Writ large by Zeus upon a mortal life ,</l>
     <l n="648">Writ large , and yet a riddle . For sometimes</l>
     <l n="649">I read its meaning thus : Life is a chase ,</l>
     <l n="650">And Man the hunter , always following on ,</l>
     <l n="651">With hounds of rushing thought or fiery sense ,</l>
     <l n="652">Some hidden truth or beauty , fleeting still</l>
     <l n="653">For ever through the thick-leaved coverts deep</l>
     <l n="654">And wind-worn wolds of time . And if he turn</l>
     <l n="655">A moment from the hot pursuit to seize</l>
     <l n="656">Some chance-brought sweetness , other than the search</l>
     <l n="657">To which his soul is set ,— some dalliance ,</l>
     <l n="658">Some outward shape of Art , some lower love ,</l>
     <l n="659">Some charm of wealth and sleek content and home ,—</l>
     <l n="660">Then , if he check an instant , the swift chase</l>
     <l n="661">Of fierce untempered energies which pursue ,</l>
     <l n="662">With jaws unsated and a thirst for act ,</l>
     <l n="663">Bears down on him with clanging shock , and whelms</l>
     <l n="664">His prize and him in ruin .</l>
     <l n="665">And sometimes</l>
     <l n="666">I seem to myself a thinker , who at last ,</l>
     <l n="667">Amid the chase and capture of low ends ,</l>
     <l n="668">Pausing by some cold well of hidden thought</l>
     <l n="669">Comes on some perfect truth , and looks and looks</l>
     <l n="670">Till the fair vision blinds him . And the sum</l>
     <l n="671">Of all his lower self pursuing him ,</l>
     <l n="672">The strong brute forces , the unchecked desires ,</l>
     <l n="673">Finding him bound and speechless , deem him now</l>
     <l n="674">No more their master , but some soulless thing ;</l>
     <l n="675">And leap on him , and seize him , and possess</l>
     <l n="676">His life , till through death 's gate he pass to life ,</l>
     <l n="677">And , his own ghost , revives . But looks no more</l>
     <l n="678">Upon the truth unveiled , save through a cloud</l>
     <l n="679">Of creed and faith and longing , which shall change</l>
     <l n="680">One day to perfect knowledge .</l>
     <l n="681">But whoe'er</l>
     <l n="682">Shall read the riddle of my life , I walk</l>
     <l n="683">In this dim land amid dim ghosts of kings ,</l>
     <l n="684">As one day thou shalt ; meantime , fare thou well . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="685">Then passed he ; and I marked him slowly go</l>
     <l n="686">Along the winding ways of that weird land ,</l>
     <l n="687">And vanish in a wood .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="688">And next I knew</l>
     <l n="689">A woman perfect as a young man 's dream ,</l>
     <l n="690">And breathing as it seemed the old sweet air</l>
     <l n="691">Of the fair days of old , when man was young</l>
     <l n="692">And life an Epic . Round the lips a smile</l>
     <l n="693">Subtle and deep and sweet as hers who looks</l>
     <l n="694">From the old painter 's canvas , and derides</l>
     <l n="695">Life and the riddle of things , the aimless strife ,</l>
     <l n="696">The folly of Love , as who has proved it all ,</l>
     <l n="697">Enjoyed and suffered . In the lovely eyes</l>
     <l n="698">A weary look , no other than the gaze</l>
     <l n="699">Which ofttimes as the rapid chariot whirls ,</l>
     <l n="700">And ofttimes by the glaring midnight streets ,</l>
     <l n="701">Gleams out and chills our thought . And yet not guilt</l>
     <l n="702">Nor sorrow was it ; only weariness ,</l>
     <l n="703">No more , and still most lovely . As I named</l>
     <l n="704">Her name in haste , she looked with half surprise ,</l>
     <l n="705">And thus she seemed to speak :</l>
     <l n="706">“ What ? Dost thou know</l>
     <l n="707">Thou too , the fatal glances which beguiled</l>
     <l n="708">Those strong rude chiefs of old ? Has not the gloom</l>
     <l n="709">Of this dim land withdrawn from out mine eyes</l>
     <l n="710">The glamour which once filled them ? Does my cheek</l>
     <l n="711">Retain the round of youth and still defy</l>
     <l n="712">The wear of immemorial centuries ?</l>
     <l n="713">And this low voice , long silent , keeps it still</l>
     <l n="714">The music of old time ? Aye , in thine eyes</l>
     <l n="715">I read it , and within thine eyes I see</l>
     <l n="716">Thou knowest me , and the story of my life</l>
     <l n="717">Sung by the blind old bard when I was dead ,</l>
     <l n="718">And all my lovers dust . I know thee not ,</l>
     <l n="719">Thee nor thy gods , yet would I soothly swear</l>
     <l n="720">I was not all to blame for what has been ,</l>
     <l n="721">The long fight , the swift death , the woes , the tears</l>
     <l n="722">The brave lives spent , the humble homes uptorn</l>
     <l n="723">To gain one poor fair face . It was not I</l>
     <l n="724">That curved these lips into this subtle smile ,</l>
     <l n="725">Or gave these eyes their fire , nor yet made round</l>
     <l n="726">This supple frame . It was not I , but Love ,</l>
     <l n="727">Love mirroring himself in all things fair ,</l>
     <l n="728">Love that projects himself upon a life ,</l>
     <l n="729">And dotes on his own image .</l>
     <l n="730">Ah ! the days ,</l>
     <l n="731">The weary years of Love and feasts and gold ,</l>
     <l n="732">The hurried flights , the din of clattering hoofs</l>
     <l n="733">At midnight , when the heroes dared for me ,</l>
     <l n="734">And bore me o'er the hills ; the swift pursuits</l>
     <l n="735">Baffled and lost ; or when from isle to isle</l>
     <l n="736">The high-oared galley spread its wings and rose</l>
     <l n="737">Over the swelling surges , and I saw ,</l>
     <l n="738">Time after time , the scarce familiar town ,</l>
     <l n="739">The sharp-cut hills , the well-loved palaces ,</l>
     <l n="740">The gleaming temples fade , and all for me ,</l>
     <l n="741">Me the dead prize , the shell , the soulless ghost ,</l>
     <l n="742">The husk of a true woman ; the fond words</l>
     <l n="743">Wasted on careless ears , that seemed to hear ,</l>
     <l n="744">Of love to me unloving ; the rich feasts ,</l>
     <l n="745">The silken dalliance and soft luxury ,</l>
     <l n="746">The fair observance and high reverence</l>
     <l n="747">For me who cared not , to whatever land</l>
     <l n="748">My kingly lover snatched me . I have known</l>
     <l n="749">How small a fence Love sets between the king</l>
     <l n="750">And the strong hind , who breeds his brood , and dies</l>
     <l n="751">Upon the field he tills . I have exchanged</l>
     <l n="752">People for people , crown for glittering crown ,</l>
     <l n="753">Through every change a queen , and held my state</l>
     <l n="754">Hateful , and sickened in my soul to lie</l>
     <l n="755">Stretched on soft cushions to the lutes ’ low sound ,</l>
     <l n="756">While on the wasted fields the clang of arms</l>
     <l n="757">Rang , and the foemen perished , and swift death ,</l>
     <l n="758">Hunger , and plague , and every phase of woe</l>
     <l n="759">Vexed all the land for me . I have heard the curse</l>
     <l n="760">Unspoken , when the wife widowed for me</l>
     <l n="761">Clasped to her heart her orphans starved for me ;</l>
     <l n="762">As I swept proudly by . I have prayed the gods ,</l>
     <l n="763">Hating my own fair face which wrought such woe ,</l>
     <l n="764">Some plague divine might light on it and leave</l>
     <l n="765">My curse a ruin . Yet I think indeed</l>
     <l n="766">They had not cursed but pitied , those true wives</l>
     <l n="767">Who mourned their humble lords , and straining felt</l>
     <l n="768">The innocent thrill which swells the mother 's heart</l>
     <l n="769">Who clasps her growing boy ; had they but known</l>
     <l n="770">The lifeless life , the pain of hypocrite smiles ,</l>
     <l n="771">The dead load of caresses simulated ,</l>
     <l n="772">When Love stands shuddering by to see his fires</l>
     <l n="773">Lit for the shrine of gold . What if they felt</l>
     <l n="774">The weariness of loveless love which grew</l>
     <l n="775">And through the jealous palace portals seized</l>
     <l n="776">The caged unloving woman , sick of toys ,</l>
     <l n="777">Sick of her gilded chains , her ease , herself ,</l>
     <l n="778">Till for sheer weariness she flew to meet</l>
     <l n="779">Some new unloved seducer ? What if they knew</l>
     <l n="780">No childish loving hands , or worse than all ,</l>
     <l n="781">Had borne them sullen to a sire unloved ,</l>
     <l n="782">And left them without pain ? I might have been ,</l>
     <l n="783">I too , a loving mother and chaste wife ,</l>
     <l n="784">Had Fate so willed .</l>
     <l n="785">For I remember well</l>
     <l n="786">How one day straying from my father 's halls</l>
     <l n="787">Seeking anemones and violets ,</l>
     <l n="788">A girl in Spring-time , when the heart makes Spring</l>
     <l n="789">Within the budding bosom , that I came</l>
     <l n="790">Of a sudden through a wood upon a bay ,</l>
     <l n="791">A little sunny land-locked bay , whose banks</l>
     <l n="792">Sloped gently downward to the yellow sand ,</l>
     <l n="793">Where the blue wave creamed soft with fairy foam ,</l>
     <l n="794">And oft the Nereids sported . As I strayed</l>
     <l n="795">Singing , with fresh-pulled violets in my hair</l>
     <l n="796">And bosom , and my hands were full of flowers ,</l>
     <l n="797">I came upon a little milk-white lamb ,</l>
     <l n="798">And took it in my arms and fondled it ,</l>
     <l n="799">And wreathed its neck with flowers , and sang to it</l>
     <l n="800">And kissed it , and the Spring was in my life ,</l>
     <l n="801">And I was glad .</l>
     <l n="802">And when I raised my eyes</l>
     <l n="803">Behold , a youthful shepherd with his crook</l>
     <l n="804">Stood by me and regarded as I lay ,</l>
     <l n="805">Tall , fair , with clustering curls , and front that wore</l>
     <l n="806">A budding manhood . As I looked a fear</l>
     <l n="807">Came o'er me , lest he were some youthful god</l>
     <l n="808">Disguised in shape of man , so fair he was ;</l>
     <l n="809">But when he spoke , the kindly face was full</l>
     <l n="810">Of manhood , and the large eyes full of fire</l>
     <l n="811">Drew me without a word , and all the flowers</l>
     <l n="812">Fell from me , and the little milk-white lamb</l>
     <l n="813">Strayed through the brake , and took with it the white</l>
     <l n="814">Fair years of childhood . Time fulfilled my being</l>
     <l n="815">With passion like a cup , and with one kiss</l>
     <l n="816">Left me a woman .</l>
     <l n="817">Ah ! the lovely days ,</l>
     <l n="818">When on the warm bank crowned with flowers we sate</l>
     <l n="819">And thought no harm , and his thin reed pipe made</l>
     <l n="820">Low music , and no witness of our love</l>
     <l n="821">Intruded , but the tinkle of the flock</l>
     <l n="822">Came from the hill , and ‘ neath the odorous shade</l>
     <l n="823">We dreamed away the day , and watched the waves</l>
     <l n="824">Steal shoreward , and beyond the sylvan capes</l>
     <l n="825">The innumerable laughter of the sea !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="826">Ah youth and love ! So passed the happy days</l>
     <l n="827">Till twilight , and I stole as in a dream</l>
     <l n="828">Homeward , and lived as in a happy dream ,</l>
     <l n="829">And when they spoke answered as in a dream ,</l>
     <l n="830">And through the darkness saw , as in a glass ,</l>
     <l n="831">The happy , happy day , and thrilled and glowed</l>
     <l n="832">And kept my love in sleep , and longed for dawn</l>
     <l n="833">And scarcely stayed for hunger , and with morn</l>
     <l n="834">Stole eager to the little wood , and fed</l>
     <l n="835">My life with kisses . Ah ! the joyous days</l>
     <l n="836">Of innocence , when Love was Queen in heaven ,</l>
     <l n="837">And nature unreproved ! Break they then still ,</l>
     <l n="838">Those azure circles , on a golden shore ?</l>
     <l n="839">Smiles there no glade upon the older earth</l>
     <l n="840">Where spite of all , gray wisdom , and new gods ,</l>
     <l n="841">Young lovers dream within each other 's arms</l>
     <l n="842">Silent , by shadowy grove , or sunlit sea ?</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="843">Ah days too fair to last ! There came a night</l>
     <l n="844">When I lay longing for my love , and knew</l>
     <l n="845">Sudden the clang of hoofs , the broken doors .</l>
     <l n="846">The clash of swords , the shouts , the groans , the stain</l>
     <l n="847">Of red upon the marble , the fixed gaze</l>
     <l n="848">Of dead and dying eyes ,— that was the time</l>
     <l n="849">When first I looked on death ,— and when I woke</l>
     <l n="850">From my deep swoon , I felt the night air cool</l>
     <l n="851">Upon my brow , and the cold stars look down ,</l>
     <l n="852">As swift we galloped o'er the darkling plain ;</l>
     <l n="853">And saw the chill sea glimpses slowly wake ,</l>
     <l n="854">With arms unknown around me . When the dawn</l>
     <l n="855">Broke swift , we panted on the pathless steeps ,</l>
     <l n="856">And so by plain and mountain till we came</l>
     <l n="857">To Athens , where they kept me till I grew</l>
     <l n="858">Fairer with every year , and many wooed ,</l>
     <l n="859">Heroes and chieftains , but I loved not one .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="860">And then the avengers came and snatched me back</l>
     <l n="861">To Sparta . All the dark high-crested chiefs</l>
     <l n="862">Of Argos wooed me , striving king with king</l>
     <l n="863">For one fair foolish face , nor knew I kept</l>
     <l n="864">No heart to give them . Yet since I was grown</l>
     <l n="865">Weary of honeyed words and suit of love ,</l>
     <l n="866">I wedded a brave chief , dauntless and true .</l>
     <l n="867">But what cared I ? I could not prize at all</l>
     <l n="868">His honest service . I had grown so tired</l>
     <l n="869">Of loving and of love , that when they brought</l>
     <l n="870">News that the fairest shepherd on the hills ,</l>
     <l n="871">Having done himself to death for his lost love ,</l>
     <l n="872">Lay , like a lovely statue , cold and white</l>
     <l n="873">Upon the golden sand , I hardly knew</l>
     <l n="874">More than a passing pang . Love , like a flower ,</l>
     <l n="875">Love , springing up too tall in a young breast ,</l>
     <l n="876">The growth of morning , Life 's too scorching sun</l>
     <l n="877">Had withered long ere noon . Love , like a flame</l>
     <l n="878">On his own altar offering up my heart ,</l>
     <l n="879">Had burnt my being to ashes .</l>
     <l n="880">Was it love</l>
     <l n="881">That drew me then to Paris ? He was fair ,</l>
     <l n="882">I grant you , fairer than a summer morn ,</l>
     <l n="883">Fair with a woman 's fairness , yet in arms</l>
     <l n="884">A hero , but he never had my heart ,</l>
     <l n="885">Not love for him allured me , but the thirst</l>
     <l n="886">For freedom , if in more than thought I erred ,</l>
     <l n="887">And was not rapt but willing . For my child ,</l>
     <l n="888">Born to an unloved father , loved me not ,</l>
     <l n="889">The fresh sea called , the galleys plunged , and I</l>
     <l n="890">Fled willing from my prison and the pain</l>
     <l n="891">Of undesired caresses , and the wind</l>
     <l n="892">Was fair , and on the third day as we sailed ,</l>
     <l n="893">My heart was glad within me when I saw</l>
     <l n="894">The towers of Ilium rise beyond the wave .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="895">Ah , the long years , the melancholy years ,</l>
     <l n="896">The miserable melancholy years !</l>
     <l n="897">For soon the new grew old , and then I grew</l>
     <l n="898">Weary of him , of all , of pomp and state</l>
     <l n="899">And novel splendour . Yet at times I knew</l>
     <l n="900">Some thrill of pride within me as I saw</l>
     <l n="901">From those high walls , a prisoner and a foe ,</l>
     <l n="902">The swift ships flock at anchor in the bay ,</l>
     <l n="903">The hasty landing and the flash of arms ,</l>
     <l n="904">The lines of royal tents upon the plain ,</l>
     <l n="905">The close-shut gates , the chivalry within</l>
     <l n="906">Issuing in all its pride to meet the shock</l>
     <l n="907">Of the bold chiefs without ; so year by year</l>
     <l n="908">The haughty challenge from the warring hosts</l>
     <l n="909">Rang forth , and I with a divided heart</l>
     <l n="910">Saw victory incline , now here , now there ,</l>
     <l n="911">And helpless marked the Argive chiefs I knew ,</l>
     <l n="912">The spouse I left , the princely loves of old ,</l>
     <l n="913">Now with each other strive , and now with Troy :</l>
     <l n="914">The brave pomp of the morn , the fair strong limbs ,</l>
     <l n="915">The glittering panoply , the bold young hearts ,</l>
     <l n="916">Athirst for fame of war , and with the night</l>
     <l n="917">The broken spear , the shattered helm , the plume</l>
     <l n="918">Dyed red with blood , the ghastly dying face ,</l>
     <l n="919">And nerveless limbs laid lifeless . And I knew</l>
     <l n="920">The stainless Hector whom I could have loved ,</l>
     <l n="921">But that a happy love made blind his eyes</l>
     <l n="922">To all my baleful beauty ; fallen and dragged</l>
     <l n="923">His noble , manly head upon the sand</l>
     <l n="924">By young Achilles ’ chariot ; him in turn</l>
     <l n="925">Fallen and slain ; my fair false Paris slain ;</l>
     <l n="926">Plague , famine , battle , raging now within ,</l>
     <l n="927">And now without , for many a weary year ,</l>
     <l n="928">Summer and winter , till I loathed to live ,</l>
     <l n="929">Who was indeed , as well they said , the Hell</l>
     <l n="930">Of men , and fleets , and cities . As I stood</l>
     <l n="931">Upon the walls , ofttimes a longing came ,</l>
     <l n="932">Looking on rage , and fight , and blood , and death ,</l>
     <l n="933">To end it all , and dash me down and die ;</l>
     <l n="934">But no god helped me . Nay , one day I mind</l>
     <l n="935">I would entreat them . ‘ Pray you , lords , be men .</l>
     <l n="936">What fatal charm is this which Ate gives</l>
     <l n="937">To one poor foolish face ? Be strong , and turn</l>
     <l n="938">In peace , forget this glamour , get you home</l>
     <l n="939">With all your fleets and armies , to the land</l>
     <l n="940">I love no longer , where your faithful wives</l>
     <l n="941">Pine widowed of their lords , and your young boys</l>
     <l n="942">Grow wild to manhood . I have nought to give ,</l>
     <l n="943">No heart , nor prize of love for any man ,</l>
     <l n="944">Nor recompense . I am the ghost alone</l>
     <l n="945">Of the fair girl ye knew ; she still abides ,</l>
     <l n="946">If she still lives and is not wholly dead ,</l>
     <l n="947">Stretched on a flowery bank upon the sea</l>
     <l n="948">In fair heroic Argos . Leave this form</l>
     <l n="949">That is no other than the outward shell</l>
     <l n="950">Of a once loving woman . ’</l>
     <l n="951">As I spake ,</l>
     <l n="952">My pity fired my eyes and flushed my cheek</l>
     <l n="953">With some soft charm ; and as I spread my hands ,</l>
     <l n="954">The purple , glancing down a little , left</l>
     <l n="955">The marble of my breasts and one pink bud</l>
     <l n="956">Upon the gleaming snows . And as I looked</l>
     <l n="957">With a mixed pride and terror , I beheld</l>
     <l n="958">The brute rise up within them , and my words</l>
     <l n="959">Fall barren on them . So I sat apart ,</l>
     <l n="960">Nor ever more looked forth , while every day</l>
     <l n="961">Brought its own woe .</l>
     <l n="962">The melancholy years ,</l>
     <l n="963">The miserable melancholy years ,</l>
     <l n="964">Crept onward till the midnight terror came ,</l>
     <l n="965">And by the glare of burning streets I saw</l>
     <l n="966">Palace and temple reel in ruin and fall ,</l>
     <l n="967">And the long-baffled legions , bursting in</l>
     <l n="968">By gate and bastion , blunted sword and spear</l>
     <l n="969">With unresisted slaughter . From my tower</l>
     <l n="970">I saw the good old king ; his kindly eyes</l>
     <l n="971">In agony , and all his reverend hairs</l>
     <l n="972">Dabbled with blood , as the fierce foeman thrust</l>
     <l n="973">And stabbed him as he lay ; the youths , the girls ,</l>
     <l n="974">Whom day by day I knew , their silken ease</l>
     <l n="975">And royal luxury changed for blood and tears ,</l>
     <l n="976">Haled forth to death or worse . Then a great hate</l>
     <l n="977">Of life and fate seized on me , and I rose</l>
     <l n="978">And rushed among them , crying , ‘ See , ‘ tis I ,</l>
     <l n="979">I who have brought this evil ! Kill me ! kill</l>
     <l n="980">The fury that is I , yet is not I !</l>
     <l n="981">And let my soul go outward through the wound</l>
     <l n="982">Made clean by blood to Hades ! Let me die ,</l>
     <l n="983">Not these who did no wrong ! ’ But not a hand</l>
     <l n="984">Was raised , and all shrank backward as afraid ,</l>
     <l n="985">As from a goddess . Then I swooned and fell</l>
     <l n="986">And knew no more , and when I woke I felt</l>
     <l n="987">My husband 's arms around me , and the wind</l>
     <l n="988">Blew fair for Greece , and the beaked galley plunged ;</l>
     <l n="989">And where the towers of Ilium rose of old ,</l>
     <l n="990">A pall of smoke above a glare of fire .</l>

     <l n="992">Ten long years</l>
     <l n="993">Bring youth and love to that deep summer-tide</l>
     <l n="994">When the full noisy current of our lives</l>
     <l n="995">Creeps dumb through wealth of flowers . I think I knew</l>
     <l n="996">Somewhat of peace at last , with my good Lord</l>
     <l n="997">Who loved too much , to palter with the past ,</l>
     <l n="998">Flushed with the present . Young Hermione</l>
     <l n="999">Had grown from child to woman . She was wed ;</l>
     <l n="1000">And was not I her mother ? At the pomp</l>
     <l n="1001">Of solemn nuptials and requited love ,</l>
     <l n="1002">I prayed she might be happy , happier far</l>
     <l n="1003">Than ever I was ; so in tranquil ease</l>
     <l n="1004">I lived a queen long time , and because wealth</l>
     <l n="1005">And high observance can make sweet our days</l>
     <l n="1006">When youth 's swift joy is past , I did requite</l>
     <l n="1007">With what I might , not love , the kindly care</l>
     <l n="1008">Of him I loved not ; pomps and robes of price</l>
     <l n="1009">And chariots held me . But when Fate cut short</l>
     <l n="1010">His life and love , his sons who were not mine</l>
     <l n="1011">Reigned in his stead , and hated me and mine :</l>
     <l n="1012">And knowing I was friendless , I sailed forth</l>
     <l n="1013">Once more across the sea , seeking for rest</l>
     <l n="1014">And shelter . Still I knew that in my eyes</l>
     <l n="1015">Love dwelt , and all the baleful charm of old</l>
     <l n="1016">Burned as of yore , scarce dimmed as yet by time :</l>
     <l n="1017">I saw it in the mirror of the sea ,</l>
     <l n="1018">I saw it in the youthful seamen 's eyes ,</l>
     <l n="1019">And was half proud again I had such power</l>
     <l n="1020">Who now kept nothing else . So one calm eve ,</l>
     <l n="1021">Behold , a sweet fair isle blushed like a rose</l>
     <l n="1022">Upon the summer sea : there my swift ship</l>
     <l n="1023">Cast anchor , and they told me it was Rhodes .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="1024">There , in a little wood above the sea ,</l>

     <l n="1026">Forlorn , and all my seamen were apart ,</l>
     <l n="1027">And I , alone ; when at the close of day</l>
     <l n="1028">I knew myself surrounded by strange churls</l>

     <l n="1032">Of hate within her eyes , ‘ Quick , bind her , men !</l>
     <l n="1033">I know her ; bind her fast ! ’ Then to the trunk</l>
     <l n="1034">Of a tall plane they bound me with rude cords</l>
     <l n="1035">That cut my arms . And meantime , far below ,</l>

     <l n="1061">Of Being , and the immeasurable depths</l>

     <l n="1063">And left me smiling in the eyes of death ,</l>
     <l n="1064">With this deep smile thou seest . Then with a shriek</l>
     <l n="1065">The woman leapt on me , and with blind rage</l>

     <l n="1067">She swooned , and those her followers hasting back</l>
     <l n="1068">Fell prone upon their knees before the corpse</l>
     <l n="1069">As to a goddess . Then one went and brought</l>
     <l n="1070">A sculptor , and within a jewelled shrine</l>

     <l n="1077">But I think , indeed ,</l>
     <l n="1078">They well might worship still , for never yet</l>
     <l n="1079">Was any thought or thing of beauty born</l>
     <l n="1080">Except with suffering . That poor wretch who thought</l>

     <l n="1082">Which she prized but I could not , what knew she</l>
     <l n="1083">Of that I suffered ? She had loved her love ,</l>
     <l n="1084">Though unrequited , and had borne to him</l>
     <l n="1085">Children who loved her . What if she had been</l>
     <l n="1086">Loved yet unloving : all the fire of love</l>
     <l n="1087">Burnt out before love 's time in one brief blaze</l>
     <l n="1088">Of passion . Ah , poor fool ! I pity her ,</l>

     <l n="1094">Of simple loving , doubtless , as I tired</l>
     <l n="1095">Of splendour and being loved . There be some souls</l>
     <l n="1096">For which love is enough , content to bear</l>
     <l n="1097">From youth to age , from chesnut locks to gray ,</l>
     <l n="1098">The load of common , uneventful life</l>

     <l n="1101">That I had reared my simple shepherd brood ,</l>

     <l n="1103">Among the Argive hills ; or lived a queen</l>
     <l n="1104">As I did , knowing every day that dawned</l>
     <l n="1105">Some high emprise and glorious , and in death</l>
     <l n="1106">To fill the world with song . Not the same meed</l>
     <l n="1107">The gods mete out for all , or She , the dread</l>

     <l n="1111">We are what Zeus has made us , discords playing</l>

     <l n="1125">Next there came</l>
     <l n="1126">Two who together walked : one with a lyre</l>

     <l n="1128">Upon his breast , and closely clung to him ,</l>
     <l n="1129">Spent in a tender longing . As they came ,</l>
     <l n="1130">I heard her gentle voice recounting o'er</l>
     <l n="1131">Some ancient tale , and these the words she said :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="1132">“ Dear voice and lyre now silent , which I heard</l>
     <l n="1133">Across yon sullen river , bringing to me</l>
     <l n="1134">All my old life , and he , the ferryman ,</l>
     <l n="1135">Heard and obeyed , and the grim monster heard</l>
     <l n="1136">And fawned on you . Joyous thou cam'st and free</l>
     <l n="1137">Like a white sunbeam from the dear bright earth ,</l>
     <l n="1138">Where suns shone clear , and moons beamed bright , and streams</l>
     <l n="1139">Laughed with a rippling music ,— nor as here</l>
     <l n="1140">The dumb stream stole , the veiled sky slept , the fields</l>
     <l n="1141">Were lost in twilight . Like a morning breeze ,</l>
     <l n="1142">Which blows in summer from the gates of dawn</l>
     <l n="1143">Across the fields of spice , and wakes to life</l>
     <l n="1144">Their slumbering perfume , through this silent land</l>
     <l n="1145">Of whispering voices and of half-closed eyes ,</l>
     <l n="1146">Where scarce a footstep sounds , nor any strain</l>
     <l n="1147">Of earthly song , thou cam'st ; and suddenly</l>
     <l n="1148">The pale cheeks flushed a little , the murmured words</l>
     <l n="1149">Rose to a faint , thin treble ; the throng of ghosts</l>
     <l n="1150">Pacing along the sunless ways and still ,</l>
     <l n="1151">Felt a new life . Thou camest , dear , and straight</l>
     <l n="1152">The dull cold river broke in sparkling foam ,</l>
     <l n="1153">The pale and scentless flowers grew perfumed ; last</l>
     <l n="1154">To the dim chamber , where with the sad queen</l>
     <l n="1155">I sat in gloom , and silently inwove</l>
     <l n="1156">Dead wreaths of amaranths ; thy music came</l>
     <l n="1157">Laden with life , and I , who seemed to know</l>
     <l n="1158">Not life 's voice only , but my own , rose up ,</l>
     <l n="1159">Along the hollow pathways following</l>
     <l n="1160">The sound which brought back earth and life and love ,</l>
     <l n="1161">And memory and longing . Yet I went</l>
     <l n="1162">With half-reluctant footsteps , as of one</l>
     <l n="1163">Whom passion draws , or some high fantasy ,</l>
     <l n="1164">Despite himself , because some subtle spell ,</l>
     <l n="1165">Part born of dread to cross that sullen stream</l>
     <l n="1166">And its grim guardians , part of secret shame</l>
     <l n="1167">Of the young airs and freshness of the earth ,</l>
     <l n="1168">Being that I was , enchained me .</l>
     <l n="1169">Then at last ,</l>
     <l n="1170">From voice and lyre so high a strain arose</l>
     <l n="1171">As trembled on the utter verge of being ,</l>
     <l n="1172">And thrilling , poured out life . Thus closelier drawn</l>
     <l n="1173">I walked with thee , shut in by halcyon sound</l>
     <l n="1174">And soft environments of harmony ,</l>
     <l n="1175">Beyond the ghostly gates , beyond the dim</l>
     <l n="1176">Calm fields , where the beetle hummed and the pale owl</l>
     <l n="1177">Stole noiseless from the copse , and the white blooms</l>
     <l n="1178">Stretched thin for lack of sun : so fair a light</l>
     <l n="1179">Born out of consonant sound environed me .</l>
     <l n="1180">Nor looked I backward , as we seemed to move</l>
     <l n="1181">To some high goal of thought and life and love ,</l>
     <l n="1182">Like twin birds flying fast with equal wing</l>
     <l n="1183">Out of the night , to meet the coming sun</l>
     <l n="1184">Above a sea . But on thy dear fair eyes ,</l>
     <l n="1185">The eyes that well I knew on the old earth ,</l>
     <l n="1186">I looked not , for with still averted gaze</l>
     <l n="1187">Thou leddest , and I followed ; for , indeed ,</l>
     <l n="1188">While that high strain was sounding , I was rapt</l>
     <l n="1189">In faith and a high courage , driving out</l>
     <l n="1190">All doubt and discontent and womanish fear ,</l>
     <l n="1191">Nay , even my love itself . But when awhile</l>
     <l n="1192">It sank a little , or seemed to sink and fall</l>
     <l n="1193">To lower levels , seeing that use makes blunt</l>
     <l n="1194">The too accustomed ear , straightway , desire</l>
     <l n="1195">To look once more on thy recovered eyes</l>
     <l n="1196">Seized me , and oft I called with piteous voice ,</l>
     <l n="1197">Beseeching thee to turn . But thou long time</l>
     <l n="1198">Wert even as one unmindful , with grave sign</l>
     <l n="1199">And waving hand , denying . Finally ,</l>
     <l n="1200">When now we neared the stream , on whose far shore</l>
     <l n="1201">Lay life , great terror took me , and I shrieked</l>
     <l n="1202">Thy name , as in despair . Then thou , as one</l>
     <l n="1203">Who knows him set in some great jeopardy ,</l>
     <l n="1204">A swift death fronting him on either hand ,</l>
     <l n="1205">Didst slowly turning gaze ; and lo ! I saw</l>
     <l n="1206">Thine eyes grown awful , life that looked on death ,</l>
     <l n="1207">Clear purity on dark and cankered sin ,</l>
     <l n="1208">The immortal on corruption ,— not the eyes</l>
     <l n="1209">That erst I knew in life , but dreadfuller ,</l>
     <l n="1210">And stranger . As I looked , I seemed to swoon ,</l>
     <l n="1211">Some blind force whirled me back , and when I woke</l>
     <l n="1212">I saw thee vanish in the middle stream ,</l>
     <l n="1213">A speck on the dull waters , taking with thee</l>
     <l n="1214">My life , and leaving Love with me . But I</l>
     <l n="1215">Not for myself bewail , but all for thee ,</l>
     <l n="1216">Who , but for me , wert now among the stars</l>
     <l n="1217">With thy great Lord ; I sitting at thy feet :</l>
     <l n="1218">But now the fierce and unrestrained rout</l>
     <l n="1219">Of passions woman-natured , finding thee</l>
     <l n="1220">Scornful of love within thy lonely cell ,</l>
     <l n="1221">With blind rage falling on thee , tore thy limbs ,</l>
     <l n="1222">And left them to the Muses ’ sepulture ,</l>
     <l n="1223">While thy soul dwells in Hades . But I wail</l>
     <l n="1224">My weakness always , who for Love destroyed</l>
     <l n="1225">The life that was my Love . I prithee , dear ,</l>
     <l n="1226">Forgive me if thou canst , who hast lost heaven</l>
     <l n="1227">To save a loving woman . ”</l>
     <l n="1228">He with voice</l>
     <l n="1229">Sweeter than any mortal melody ,</l>
     <l n="1230">And plaintive as the music that is made</l>
     <l n="1231">By the AEolian strings , or the sad bird</l>
     <l n="1232">That sings of summer nights :</l>
     <l n="1233">“ Eurydice ,</l>
     <l n="1234">Dear love , be comforted ; not once alone</l>
     <l n="1235">That which thou mournest is , but day by day</l>
     <l n="1236">Some lonely soul , which walks apart and feeds</l>
     <l n="1237">On high hill pastures , far from herds of men ,</l>
     <l n="1238">Comes to the low fat fields , and sunny vales</l>
     <l n="1239">Joyous with fruits and flowers , and the white arms</l>
     <l n="1240">Of laughing love ; and there awhile he stays</l>
     <l n="1241">Content , forgetting all the joys he knew ,</l>
     <l n="1242">When first the morning broke upon the hills ,</l>
     <l n="1243">And the keen air breathed from the Eastern gates</l>
     <l n="1244">Like a pure draught of wine ; forgetting all</l>
     <l n="1245">The strains which float , as from a nearer heaven ,</l>
     <l n="1246">To him who treads at dawn the untrodden snows ,</l>
     <l n="1247">While all the warm world sleeps ;— forgetting these</l>
     <l n="1248">And all things that have been . And if he gain</l>
     <l n="1249">To raise to his own heights the simpler souls</l>
     <l n="1250">That dwell upon the plains , the untutored thought ,</l>
     <l n="1251">The museless lives , the unawakened brain</l>
     <l n="1252">That yet might soar , then is he blest indeed .</l>
     <l n="1253">But if he fail , then , leaving love behind ,</l>
     <l n="1254">The wider love of the race , the closer love</l>
     <l n="1255">Of some congenial soul , he turns again</l>
     <l n="1256">To the old difficult steeps , and there alone</l>
     <l n="1257">Pines , till the widowed passions of his heart</l>
     <l n="1258">Tear him and rend his soul , and drive him down</l>
     <l n="1259">To the low plains he left . And there he dwells ,</l>
     <l n="1260">Missing the heavens , dear , and the white peaks ,</l>
     <l n="1261">And the light air of old ; but in their stead</l>
     <l n="1262">Finding the soft sweet sun of the vale , the clouds</l>
     <l n="1263">Which veil the skies indeed , but give the rains</l>
     <l n="1264">That feed the streams of life and make earth green ,</l>
     <l n="1265">And bring at last the harvest . So I walk</l>
     <l n="1266">In this dim land content with thee , O Love ,</l>
     <l n="1267">Untouched by any yearning of regret</l>
     <l n="1268">For those old days ; nor that the lyre which made</l>
     <l n="1269">Erewhile such potent music now is dumb ;</l>
     <l n="1270">Nor that the voice that once could move the earth</l>
     <l n="1271">( Zeus speaking through it ) , speaks in household words</l>
     <l n="1272">Of homely love : Love is enough for me</l>

     <l n="1278">Then he stooped ,</l>
     <l n="1279">And , folded in one long embrace , they went</l>
     <l n="1280">And faded . And I cried , “ Oh , strong God , Love ,</l>

     <l n="1339">Of what I know was hate , and he said , ‘ Take</l>
     <l n="1340">This white robe . It is costly . See , my blood</l>
     <l n="1341">Has stained it but a little . I did wrong :</l>
     <l n="1342">I know it , and repent me . If there come</l>
     <l n="1343">A time when he grows cold — for all the race</l>
     <l n="1344">Of heroes wander , nor can any love</l>
     <l n="1345">Fix theirs for long — take it and wrap him in it ,</l>
     <l n="1346">And he shall love again . ’ Then , from the strange</l>
     <l n="1347">Deep look within his eyes I shrank in fear ,</l>
     <l n="1348">And left him half in pity , and I went</l>
     <l n="1349">To meet my Lord , who rose from that fierce stream</l>
     <l n="1350">Fair as a god .</l>
     <l n="1351">Ah me , the weary days</l>
     <l n="1352">We women live , spending our anxious souls ,</l>
     <l n="1353">Consumed with jealous fancies , hungering still</l>
     <l n="1354">For the beloved voice and ear and eye ,</l>
     <l n="1355">And hungering all in vain ! For life is more</l>
     <l n="1356">To youthful manhood than to sit at home</l>
     <l n="1357">Before the hearth to watch the children 's ways</l>
     <l n="1358">And lead the life of petty household care</l>
     <l n="1359">Which doth content us women . Day by day</l>
     <l n="1360">I pined in Trachis for my love , while he ,</l>
     <l n="1361">Now in some warlike exploit busied , now</l>
     <l n="1362">Fighting some monster , now at some fair court ,</l>
     <l n="1363">Resting awhile till some new enterprise</l>
     <l n="1364">Called him , returned not . News of treacheries</l>
     <l n="1365">Avenged , friends succoured , dreadful monsters slain ,</l>
     <l n="1366">Came from him : always triumph , always fame ,</l>
     <l n="1367">And honour , and success , and reverence ,</l>
     <l n="1368">And sometimes , words of love for me who pined</l>
     <l n="1369">For more than words , and would have gone to him</l>
     <l n="1370">But that the toils of such high errantry</l>
     <l n="1371">Asked more than woman 's strength .</l>
     <l n="1372">So the slow years</l>
     <l n="1373">Vexed me alone in Trachis , set forlorn</l>
     <l n="1374">In solitude , nor hearing at the gate</l>
     <l n="1375">The frank and cheering voice , nor on the stair</l>
     <l n="1376">The heavy tread , nor feeling the strong arm</l>
     <l n="1377">Around me in the darkling night , when all</l>
     <l n="1378">My being ran slow . Last , subtle whispers came</l>
     <l n="1379">Of womanish wiles which kept my Lord from me ,</l>
     <l n="1380">And one who , young and fair , a fresh-blown life</l>
     <l n="1381">And virgin , younger , fairer far than I</l>
     <l n="1382">When first he loved me , held him in the toils</l>
     <l n="1383">Of scarce dissembled love . Not easily</l>
     <l n="1384">Might I believe this evil , but at last</l>
     <l n="1385">The oft-repeated malice finding me</l>
     <l n="1386">Forlorn , and sitting imp-like at my ear ,</l>
     <l n="1387">Possessed me , and the fire of jealous love</l>
     <l n="1388">Raged through my veins , not turned as yet to hate —</l>
     <l n="1389">Too well I loved for that — but breeding in me</l>
     <l n="1390">Unfaith in him . Love , setting him so high</l>
     <l n="1391">And self so low , betrayed me , and I prayed ,</l>
     <l n="1392">Constrained to hold him false , the immortal gods</l>
     <l n="1393">To make him love again .</l>
     <l n="1394">But still he came not .</l>
     <l n="1395">And still the maddening rumours worked , and still</l>
     <l n="1396">‘ Fair , young , and a king 's daughter , ’ the same words</l>
     <l n="1397">Smote me and pierced me . Oh , there is no pain</l>
     <l n="1398">In Hades — nay , nor deepest Hell itself ,</l>
     <l n="1399">Like that of jealous hearts , the torture-pain</l>
     <l n="1400">Which racked my life so long .</l>
     <l n="1401">Till one fair morn</l>
     <l n="1402">There came a joyful message . ‘ He has come !</l>
     <l n="1403">And at the shrine upon the promontory ,</l>
     <l n="1404">The fair white shrine upon the purple sea ,</l>
     <l n="1405">He waits to do his solemn sacrifice</l>
     <l n="1406">To the immortal gods ; and with him comes</l>
     <l n="1407">A young maid beautiful as Dawn . ’</l>
     <l n="1408">Then I ,</l>
     <l n="1409">Mingling despair with love , rapt in deep joy</l>
     <l n="1410">That he was come , plunged in the depths of hell</l>
     <l n="1411">That she came too , bethought me of the robe</l>
     <l n="1412">The Centaur gave me , and the words he spake ,</l>
     <l n="1413">Forgetting the deep hatred in his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="1414">And all but love , and sent a messenger</l>
     <l n="1415">Bidding him wear it for the sacrifice</l>
     <l n="1416">To the immortals , knowing not at all</l>
     <l n="1417">Whom Fate decreed the victim .</l>
     <l n="1418">Shall my soul</l>
     <l n="1419">Forget the agonized message which he sent ,</l>
     <l n="1420">Bidding me come ? For that accursed robe ,</l>
     <l n="1421">Stained with the poisonous accursed blood ,</l>
     <l n="1422">Even in the midmost flush of sacrifice</l>
     <l n="1423">Clung to him a devouring fire , and ate</l>
     <l n="1424">The piteous flesh from his dear limbs , and stung</l>
     <l n="1425">His great soft soul to madness . When I came ,</l>
     <l n="1426">Knowing it was my work , he bent on me ,</l>
     <l n="1427">Wise as a god through suffering and the near</l>
     <l n="1428">Inevitable Death , so that no word</l>
     <l n="1429">Of mine was needed , such a tender look</l>
     <l n="1430">Of mild reproach as smote me . ‘ Couldst not thou</l>
     <l n="1431">Trust me , who never loved as I love thee ?</l>
     <l n="1432">What need was there of magical arts to draw</l>
     <l n="1433">The love that never wavered ? I have lived</l>
     <l n="1434">As he lives who through perilous paths must pass ,</l>
     <l n="1435">And lifelong trials , striving to keep down</l>
     <l n="1436">The brute within him , born of too much strength</l>
     <l n="1437">And sloth and vacuous days ; by difficult toils ,</l>
     <l n="1438">Labours endured , and hard-fought fights with ill ,</l>
     <l n="1439">Now vanquished , now triumphant ; and sometimes ,</l>
     <l n="1440">In intervals of too long labour , finding</l>
     <l n="1441">His nature grown too strong for him , falls prone</l>
     <l n="1442">Awhile a helpless prey , then once again</l>
     <l n="1443">Rises and spurns his chains , and fares anew</l>
     <l n="1444">Along the perilous ways . Dearest , I would</l>
     <l n="1445">That thou wert wedded to some knight who stayed</l>
     <l n="1446">At home within thy gates , and were content</l>
     <l n="1447">To see thee happy . But for me the fierce</l>
     <l n="1448">Rude energies of life , the mighty thews ,</l>
     <l n="1449">The god-sent hate of Wrong , these drove me forth</l>
     <l n="1450">To quench the thirst of battle . See , this maid ,</l>
     <l n="1451">This is the bride I destined for our son</l>
     <l n="1452">Who grows to manhood . Do thou see to her</l>
     <l n="1453">When I am dead , for soon I know again</l>
     <l n="1454">The frenzy comes , and with it ceasing , death .</l>
     <l n="1455">Go , therefore , ere I harm thee when my strength</l>
     <l n="1456">Has lost its guidance . Thou wert rich in love ,</l>
     <l n="1457">Be now as rich in faith . Dear , for thy wrong</l>
     <l n="1458">I do forgive thee . ’</l>
     <l n="1459">When I saw the glare</l>
     <l n="1460">Of madness fire his eyes , and my ears heard</l>
     <l n="1461">The groans the torture wrung from his great soul ,</l>
     <l n="1462">I fled with broken heart to the white shrine ,</l>
     <l n="1463">And knelt in prayer , but still my sad ear took</l>
     <l n="1464">The agony of his cries .</l>
     <l n="1465">Then I who knew</l>
     <l n="1466">There was no hope in god or man for me</l>
     <l n="1467">Who had destroyed my Love , and with him slain</l>
     <l n="1468">The champion of the suffering race of men ,</l>
     <l n="1469">And knowing that my soul , though innocent</l>
     <l n="1470">Of blood , was guilty of unfaith and vile</l>
     <l n="1471">Mistrust , and wrapt in weakness like a cloak ,</l>
     <l n="1472">And made the innocent tool of hate and wrong ,</l>
     <l n="1473">Against all love and good ; grown sick and filled</l>
     <l n="1474">With hatred of myself , rose from my knees ,</l>
     <l n="1475">And went a little space apart , and found</l>
     <l n="1476">A gnarled tree on the cliff , and with my scarf</l>
     <l n="1477">Strangling myself , swung lifeless .</l>
     <l n="1478">But in death</l>
     <l n="1479">I found him not . For , building a vast pile</l>
     <l n="1480">Of scented woods on Oeta , as they tell ,</l>
     <l n="1481">My hero with his own hand lighted it ,</l>
     <l n="1482">And when the mighty pyre flamed far and wide</l>
     <l n="1483">Over all lands and seas , he climbed on it</l>
     <l n="1484">And laid him down to die ; but pitying Zeus ,</l>
     <l n="1485">Before the swift flames reached him , in a cloud</l>
     <l n="1486">Descending , snatched the strong brave soul to heaven ,</l>
     <l n="1487">And set him mid the stars .</l>
     <l n="1488">Wherefore am I</l>
     <l n="1489">Of all the blameless shades within this place</l>
     <l n="1490">The most unhappy , if of blame , indeed ,</l>
     <l n="1491">I bear no load . For what is Sin itself ,</l>
     <l n="1492">But Error when we miss the road which leads</l>
     <l n="1493">Up to the gate of heaven ? Ignorance !</l>
     <l n="1494">What if we be the cause of ignorance ?</l>
     <l n="1495">Being blind who might have seen ! Yet do I know</l>
     <l n="1496">But self-inflicted pain , nor stain there is</l>
     <l n="1497">Upon my soul such as they bear who know</l>
     <l n="1498">The dreadful scourge with which the stern judge still</l>
     <l n="1499">Lashes their sins . I am forgiven , I know ,</l>
     <l n="1500">Who loved so much , and one day , if Zeus will ,</l>
     <l n="1501">I shall go free from hence , and join my Lord ,</l>
     <l n="1502">And be with him again . ”</l>
     <l n="1503">And straight I seemed ,</l>
     <l n="1504">Passing , to look upon some scarce-spent life ,</l>
     <l n="1505">Which knows to-day the irony of Fate</l>
     <l n="1506">In self-inflicted pain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="1507">Together clung</l>
     <l n="1508">The ghosts whom next I saw , bound three in one</l>
     <l n="1509">By some invisible bond . A sire of port</l>
     <l n="1510">God-like as Zeus , to whom on either hand</l>
     <l n="1511">A tender stripling clung . I knew them well ,</l>
     <l n="1512">As all men know them . One fair youth spake low :</l>
     <l n="1513">“ Father , it does not pain me now , to be</l>
     <l n="1514">Drawn close to thee , and by a double bond ,</l>
     <l n="1515">With this my brother . ” And the other : “ Nay ,</l>
     <l n="1516">Nor me , O father ; but I bless the chain</l>
     <l n="1517">Which binds our souls in union . If some trace</l>
     <l n="1518">Of pain still linger , heed it not — ‘ tis past :</l>
     <l n="1519">Still let us cling to thee . ”</l>
     <l n="1520">He with grave eyes</l>
     <l n="1521">Full of great tenderness , upon his sons</l>
     <l n="1522">Looked with the father 's gaze , that is so far</l>
     <l n="1523">More sweet , and sad , and tender , than the gaze</l>
     <l n="1524">Of mothers ,— now on this one , now on that ,</l>
     <l n="1525">Regarding them . “ Dear sons , whom on the earth</l>
     <l n="1526">I loved and cherished , it was hard to watch</l>
     <l n="1527">Your pain ; but now ‘ tis finished , and we stand</l>
     <l n="1528">For ever , through all future days of time ,</l>
     <l n="1529">Symbols of patient suffering undeserved ,</l>
     <l n="1530">Endured and vanquished . Yet sad memory still</l>
     <l n="1531">Brings back our time of trial .</l>
     <l n="1532">For the day</l>
     <l n="1533">Broke fair when I , the dread Poseidon 's priest ,</l>
     <l n="1534">Joyous because the unholy strife was done ,</l>
     <l n="1535">And seeing the blue waters now left free</l>
     <l n="1536">Of hostile keels — save where upon the verge</l>
     <l n="1537">Far off the white sails faded — rose at dawn ,</l>
     <l n="1538">And white robed , and in garb of sacrifice ,</l>
     <l n="1539">And with the sacred fillet round my brows ,</l>
     <l n="1540">Stood at the altar ; and behind , ye twain ,</l>
     <l n="1541">Decked by your mother 's hand with new-cleansed robes ,</l>
     <l n="1542">And with fresh flower-wreathed chaplets on your curls ,</l>
     <l n="1543">Attended , and your clear young voices made</l>
     <l n="1544">Music that touched your father 's eyes with tears ,</l>
     <l n="1545">If not the careless gods . I seem to hear</l>
     <l n="1546">Those high sweet accents mounting in the hymn</l>
     <l n="1547">Which rose to all the blessed gods who dwelt</l>
     <l n="1548">Upon the far Olympus — Zeus , the Lord ,</l>
     <l n="1549">And Sovereign Here , and the immortal choir</l>
     <l n="1550">Of Deities , but chiefly to the dread</l>
     <l n="1551">Poseidon , him who sways the purple sea</l>
     <l n="1552">As with a sceptre , shaking the fixed earth</l>
     <l n="1553">With stress of thundering surges . By the shrine</l>
     <l n="1554">The meek-eyed victim , for the sacrifice ,</l>
     <l n="1555">Stood with his gilded horns . The hymns were done ,</l>
     <l n="1556">And I in act to strike , when all the crowd</l>
     <l n="1557">Who knelt behind us , with a common fear</l>
     <l n="1558">Cried , with a cry that well might freeze the blood ,</l>
     <l n="1559">And then , with fearful glances towards the sea ,</l>
     <l n="1560">Fled , leaving us alone — me , the high priest ,</l>
     <l n="1561">And ye , the acolytes ; forlorn of men ,</l>
     <l n="1562">Alone , but with our god .</l>
     <l n="1563">But we stirred not :</l>
     <l n="1564">We could not flee , who in the solemn act</l>
     <l n="1565">Of worship , and the ecstasy which comes</l>
     <l n="1566">To the believer 's soul , saw heaven revealed ,</l>
     <l n="1567">The mysteries unveiled , the inner sky</l>
     <l n="1568">Which meets the enraptured gaze . How should we fear</l>
     <l n="1569">Who thus were god-encircled ! So we stood</l>
     <l n="1570">While the long ritual spent itself , nor cast</l>
     <l n="1571">An eye upon the sea . Till as I came</l>
     <l n="1572">To that great act which offers up a life</l>
     <l n="1573">Before life 's Lord , and the full mystery</l>
     <l n="1574">Was trembling to completion , quick I heard</l>
     <l n="1575">A stifled cry of agony , and knew</l>
     <l n="1576">My children 's voices . And the father 's heart ,</l>
     <l n="1577">Which is far more than rite or service done</l>
     <l n="1578">By man for god , seeing that it is divine</l>
     <l n="1579">And comes from God to men — this rising in me ,</l>
     <l n="1580">Constrained me , and I ceased my prayer , and turned</l>
     <l n="1581">To succour you , and lo ! the awful coils</l>
     <l n="1582">Which crushed your lives already , bound me round</l>
     <l n="1583">And crushed me also , as you clung to me ,</l>
     <l n="1584">In common death . Some god had heard the prayer ,</l>
     <l n="1585">And lo ! we were ourselves the sacrifice —</l>
     <l n="1586">The priest , the victim , the accepted life ,</l>
     <l n="1587">The blood , the pain , the salutary loss .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="1588">Was it not better thus to cease and die</l>
     <l n="1589">Together in one blest moment , mid the flush</l>
     <l n="1590">And ecstasy of worship , and to know</l>
     <l n="1591">Ourselves the victims ? They were wrong who taught</l>
     <l n="1592">That ‘ twas some jealous goddess who destroyed</l>
     <l n="1593">Our lives , revengeful for discovered wiles ,</l>
     <l n="1594">Or hateful of our land . Not readily</l>
     <l n="1595">Should such base passions sway the immortal gods ;</l>
     <l n="1596">But rather do I hold it sooth indeed</l>
     <l n="1597">That Zeus himself it was , who pitying</l>
     <l n="1598">The ruin he foreknew , yet might not stay ,</l>
     <l n="1599">Since mightier Fate decreed it , sent in haste</l>
     <l n="1600">Those dreadful messengers , and bade them take</l>
     <l n="1601">The pious lives he loved , before the din</l>
     <l n="1602">Of midnight slaughter woke , and the fair town</l>
     <l n="1603">Flamed pitifully to the skies , and all</l>
     <l n="1604">Was blood and ruin . Surely it was best</l>
     <l n="1605">To die as we did , and in death to live ,</l>
     <l n="1606">A vision for all ages of high pain</l>
     <l n="1607">Which passes into beauty , and is merged</l>
     <l n="1608">In one accordant whole , as discords merge</l>
     <l n="1609">In that great Harmony which ceaseless rings</l>
     <l n="1610">From the tense chords of life , than to have lived</l>
     <l n="1611">Our separate lives , and died our separate deaths ,</l>
     <l n="1612">And left no greater mark than drops which rain</l>
     <l n="1613">Upon the unbounded sea . Those hosts which fell</l>
     <l n="1614">Before the Scaean gate upon the sand ,</l>
     <l n="1615">Nor found a bard to sing their fate , but left</l>
     <l n="1616">Their bones to dogs and kites — were they more blest</l>
     <l n="1617">Than we who , in the people 's sight before</l>
     <l n="1618">Ilium 's unshattered towers , lay down to die</l>
     <l n="1619">Our swift miraculous death ? Dear sons , and good ,</l>
     <l n="1620">Dear children of my love , how doubly dear</l>
     <l n="1621">For this our common sorrow ; suffering weaves</l>
     <l n="1622">Not only chains of darkness round , but binds</l>
     <l n="1623">A golden glittering link , which though withdrawn</l>
     <l n="1624">Or felt no longer , knits us soul to soul ,</l>
     <l n="1625">In indissoluble bonds , and draws our lives</l>
     <l n="1626">So close , that though the individual life</l>
     <l n="1627">Be merged , there springs a common life which grows</l>
     <l n="1628">To such dread beauty , as has power to take</l>

     <l n="1630">Into transcendent joy : as from the storm</l>
     <l n="1631">The unearthly rainbow draws its myriad hues</l>
     <l n="1632">And steeps the world in fairness . All our lives</l>
     <l n="1633">Are notes that fade and sink , and so are merged</l>
     <l n="1634">In the full harmony of Being . Dear sons ,</l>

     <l n="1637">Their separate strands together in a knot</l>
     <l n="1638">Closer than Life itself , stronger than Death ,</l>
     <l n="1639">Insoluble as Fate . ”</l>
     <l n="1640">Then they three clung</l>
     <l n="1641">Together — the strong father and young sons ,</l>

     <l n="1643">Fade into Joy , Suffering in Beauty lost ,</l>
     <l n="1644">And Death in Love !</l>

     <l n="1645">By a still sullen pool ,</l>
     <l n="1646">Into its dark depths gazing , lay the ghost</l>
     <l n="1647">Whom next I passed . In form , a lovely youth ,</l>
     <l n="1648">Scarce passed from boyhood . Golden curls were his ,</l>
     <l n="1649">And wide blue eyes . The semblance of a smile</l>
     <l n="1650">Came on his lip — a girl 's but for the down</l>
     <l n="1651">Which hardly shaded it ; but the pale cheek</l>
     <l n="1652">Was soft as any maiden 's , and his robe</l>
     <l n="1653">Was virginal , and at his breast he bore</l>
     <l n="1654">The perfumed amber cup which , when March comes</l>
     <l n="1655">Gems the dry woods and windy wolds , and speaks</l>
     <l n="1656">The resurrection .</l>
     <l n="1657">Looking up , he said :</l>
     <l n="1658">“ Methought I saw her then , my love , my fair ,</l>
     <l n="1659">My beauty , my ideal ; the dim clouds</l>
     <l n="1660">Lifted , methought , a little — or was it</l>
     <l n="1661">Fond Fancy only ? For I know that here</l>
     <l n="1662">No sunbeam cleaves the twilight , but a mist</l>
     <l n="1663">Creeps over all the sky and fields and pools ,</l>
     <l n="1664">And blots them ; and I know I seek in vain</l>
     <l n="1665">My earth-sought beauty , nor can Fancy bring</l>
     <l n="1666">An answer to my thought from these blind depths</l>
     <l n="1667">And unawakened skies . Yet has use made</l>
     <l n="1668">The quest so precious , that I keep it here ,</l>
     <l n="1669">Well knowing it is vain .</l>
     <l n="1670">On the old earth</l>
     <l n="1671">‘ Twas otherwise , when in fair Thessaly</l>
     <l n="1672">I walked regardless of all nymphs who sought</l>
     <l n="1673">My love , but sought in vain , whether it were</l>
     <l n="1674">Dryad or Naiad from the woods or streams ,</l>
     <l n="1675">Or white-robed Oread fleeting on the side</l>
     <l n="1676">Of fair Olympus , echoing back my sighs ,</l>
     <l n="1677">In vain , for through the mountains day by day</l>
     <l n="1678">I wandered , and along the foaming brooks ,</l>
     <l n="1679">And by the pine-woods dry , and never took</l>
     <l n="1680">A thought for love , nor ever ‘ mid the throng</l>
     <l n="1681">Of loving nymphs who knew me beautiful</l>
     <l n="1682">I dallied , unregarding ; till they said</l>
     <l n="1683">Some died for love of me , who loved not one .</l>
     <l n="1684">And yet I cared not , wandering still alone</l>
     <l n="1685">Amid the mountains by the scented pines .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="34">
     <l n="1686">Till one fair day , when all the hills were still ,</l>
     <l n="1687">Nor any breeze made murmur through the boughs ,</l>
     <l n="1688">Nor cloud was on the heavens , I wandered slow ,</l>
     <l n="1689">Leaving the nymphs who fain with dance and song</l>
     <l n="1690">Had kept me ‘ midst the glades , and strayed away</l>
     <l n="1691">Among the pines , enwrapt in fantasy ,</l>
     <l n="1692">And by the beechen dells which clothe the feet</l>
     <l n="1693">Of fair Olympus , wrapt in fantasy ,</l>
     <l n="1694">Weaving the thin and unembodied shapes</l>
     <l n="1695">Which Fancy loves to body forth , and leave</l>
     <l n="1696">In marble or in song ; and so strayed down</l>
     <l n="1697">To a low sheltered vale above the plains ,</l>
     <l n="1698">Where the lush grass grew thick , and the stream stayed</l>
     <l n="1699">Its garrulous tongue ; and last upon the bank</l>
     <l n="1700">Of a still pool I came , where was no flow</l>
     <l n="1701">Of water , but the depths were clear as air ,</l>
     <l n="1702">And nothing but the silvery gleaming side</l>
     <l n="1703">Of tiny fishes stirred . There lay I down</l>
     <l n="1704">Upon the flowery bank , and scanned the deep ,</l>
     <l n="1705">Half in a waking dream .</l>
     <l n="1706">Then swift there rose ,</l>
     <l n="1707">From those enchanted depths , a face more fair</l>
     <l n="1708">Than ever I had dreamt of , and I knew</l>
     <l n="1709">My sweet long-sought ideal : the thick curls ,</l>
     <l n="1710">Like these , were golden , and the white robe showed</l>
     <l n="1711">Like this ; but for the wondrous eyes and lips ,</l>
     <l n="1712">The tender loving glance , the sunny smile</l>
     <l n="1713">Upon the rosy mouth , these knew I not ,</l>
     <l n="1714">Not even in dreams ; and yet I seemed to trace</l>
     <l n="1715">Myself within them too , as who should find</l>
     <l n="1716">His former self expunged , and him transformed</l>
     <l n="1717">To some high thin ideal , separate</l>
     <l n="1718">From what he was , by some invisible bar ,</l>
     <l n="1719">And yet the same in difference . As I moved</l>
     <l n="1720">My arms to clasp her to me , lo ! she moved</l>
     <l n="1721">Her eager arms to mine , smiled to my smile ,</l>
     <l n="1722">Looked love to love , and answered longing eyes</l>
     <l n="1723">With longing . When my full heart burst in words ,</l>
     <l n="1724">‘ Dearest , I love thee , ’ lo ! the lovely lips ,</l>
     <l n="1725">‘ Dearest , I love thee , ’ sighed , and through the air</l>
     <l n="1726">The love-lorn echo rang . But when I longed</l>
     <l n="1727">To answer kiss with kiss , and stooped my lips</l>
     <l n="1728">To her sweet lips in that long thrill which strains</l>
     <l n="1729">Soul unto soul , the cold lymph came between</l>
     <l n="1730">And chilled our love , and kept us separate souls</l>
     <l n="1731">Which fain would mingle , and the self-same heaven</l>
     <l n="1732">Rose , a blue vault above us , and no shade</l>
     <l n="1733">Of earthly thing obscured us , as we lay</l>
     <l n="1734">Two reflex souls , one and yet different ,</l>
     <l n="1735">Two sundered souls longing to be at one .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="35">
     <l n="1736">There , all day long , until the light was gone</l>
     <l n="1737">And took my love away , I lay and loved</l>
     <l n="1738">The image , and when night was come , ‘ Farewell , ’</l>
     <l n="1739">I whispered , and she whispered back , ‘ Farewell , ’</l>
     <l n="1740">With oh , such yearning ! Many a day we spent</l>
     <l n="1741">By that clear pool together all day long .</l>
     <l n="1742">And many a clouded hour on the wet grass</l>
     <l n="1743">I lay beneath the rain , and saw her not ,</l>
     <l n="1744">And sickened for her ; and sometimes the pool</l>
     <l n="1745">Was thick with flood , and hid her ; and sometimes</l>
     <l n="1746">Some cold wind ruffled those clear wells , and left</l>
     <l n="1747">But glimpses of her , and I rose at eve</l>
     <l n="1748">Unsatisfied , a cold chill in my limbs</l>
     <l n="1749">And fever at my heart : until , too soon !</l>
     <l n="1750">The summer faded , and the skies were hid ,</l>
     <l n="1751">And my love came not , but a quenchless thirst</l>
     <l n="1752">Wasted my life . And all the winter long</l>
     <l n="1753">The bright sun shone not , or the thick ribbed ice</l>
     <l n="1754">Obscured her , and I pined for her , and knew</l>
     <l n="1755">My life ebb from me , till I grew too weak</l>
     <l n="1756">To seek her , fearing I should see no more</l>
     <l n="1757">My dear . And so the long dead winter waned</l>
     <l n="1758">And the slow spring came back .</l>
     <l n="1759">And one blithe day ,</l>
     <l n="1760">When life was in the woods , and the birds sang ,</l>
     <l n="1761">And soft airs fanned the hills , I knew again</l>
     <l n="1762">Some gleam of hope within me , and again</l>
     <l n="1763">With feeble limbs crawled forth , and felt the spring</l>
     <l n="1764">Blossom within me ; and the flower-starred glades ,</l>
     <l n="1765">The bursting trees , the building nests , the songs ,</l>
     <l n="1766">The hurry of life revived me ; and I crept ,</l>
     <l n="1767">Ghost-like , amid the joy , until I flung</l>
     <l n="1768">My panting frame , and weary nerveless limbs ,</l>
     <l n="1769">Down by the cold still pool .</l>
     <l n="1770">And lo ! I saw</l>
     <l n="1771">My love once more , not beauteous as of old ,</l>
     <l n="1772">But oh , how changed ! the fair young cheek grown pale ,</l>
     <l n="1773">The great eyes , larger than of yore , gaze forth</l>
     <l n="1774">With a sad yearning look ; and a great pain</l>
     <l n="1775">And pity took me which were more than love ,</l>
     <l n="1776">And with a loud and wailing voice I cried ,</l>
     <l n="1777">‘ Dearest , I come again . I pine for thee , ’</l>
     <l n="1778">And swift she answered back , ‘ I pine for thee ; ’</l>
     <l n="1779">‘ Come to me , oh , my own , ’ I cried , and she —</l>
     <l n="1780">‘ Come to me , oh , my own . ’ Then with a cry</l>
     <l n="1781">Of love I joined myself to her , and plunged</l>
     <l n="1782">Beneath the icy surface with a kiss ,</l>
     <l n="1783">And fainted , and am here .</l>
     <l n="1784">And now , indeed ,</l>
     <l n="1785">I know not if it was myself I sought ,</l>
     <l n="1786">As some tell , or another . For I hold</l>
     <l n="1787">That what we seek is but our other self ,</l>
     <l n="1788">Other and higher , neither wholly like</l>
     <l n="1789">Nor wholly different , the half-life the gods</l>
     <l n="1790">Retained when half was given — one the man</l>
     <l n="1791">And one the woman ; and I longed to round</l>
     <l n="1792">The imperfect essence by its complement ,</l>
     <l n="1793">For only thus the perfect life stands forth</l>
     <l n="1794">Whole , self-sufficing . Worse it is to live</l>
     <l n="1795">Ill-mated than imperfect , and to move</l>
     <l n="1796">From a false centre , not a perfect sphere ,</l>
     <l n="1797">But with a crooked bias sent oblique</l>
     <l n="1798">Athwart life 's furrows . ‘ Twas myself , indeed ,</l>
     <l n="1799">Thus only that I sought , that lovers use</l>
     <l n="1800">To see in that they love , not that which is ,</l>
     <l n="1801">But that their fancy feigns , and view themselves</l>
     <l n="1802">Reflected in their love , yet glorified ,</l>
     <l n="1803">And finer and more pure .</l>
     <l n="1804">Wherefore it is :</l>
     <l n="1805">All love which finds its own ideal mate</l>
     <l n="1806">Is happy — happy that which gives itself</l>
     <l n="1807">Unto itself , and keeps , through long calm years ,</l>
     <l n="1808">The tranquil image in its eyes , and knows</l>
     <l n="1809">Fulfilment and is blest , and day by day</l>
     <l n="1810">Wears love like a white flower , nor holds it less</l>
     <l n="1811">Though sharp winds bite , or hot suns fade , or age</l>
     <l n="1812">Sully its perfect whiteness , but inhales</l>
     <l n="1813">Its fragrance , and is glad . But happier still</l>
     <l n="1814">He who long seeks a high goal unattained ,</l>
     <l n="1815">And wearies for it all his days , nor knows</l>
     <l n="1816">Possession sate his thirst , but still pursues</l>
     <l n="1817">The fleeting loveliness — now seen , now lost ,</l>
     <l n="1818">But evermore grown fairer , till at last</l>
     <l n="1819">He stretches forth his arms and takes the fair</l>
     <l n="1820">In one long rapture , and its name is Death . ”</l>

     <l n="1851">Nor even the thin growths which scarcely clothed</l>
     <l n="1852">The higher fields might live . Hard by a cave</l>

     <l n="1855">Her head upon her hands , I saw a maid</l>

     <l n="1859">As here , the unequal measure which awaits</l>
     <l n="1860">The adjustment , and meanwhile , inspires the strife</l>
     <l n="1861">Which rears life 's palace walls ; and fills the sail</l>

     <l n="1918">And wrecked my life . How should a virgin know</l>
     <l n="1919">Deceit , who never at the joyous shrine</l>
     <l n="1920">Of Cypris knelt , but ever lived apart ,</l>
     <l n="1921">And so grew guilty ? For if I had spent</l>
     <l n="1922">My days among the throng , either my fault</l>
     <l n="1923">Were blameless , or undone . For innocence</l>
     <l n="1924">The tempter spreads his net . For innocence</l>
     <l n="1925">The gods keep all their terrors . Innocence</l>
     <l n="1926">It is that bears the burden , which for guilt</l>
     <l n="1927">Is lightened , and the spoiler goes his way ,</l>
     <l n="1928">Uncaring , joyous , leaving her alone ,</l>
     <l n="1929">The victim and unfriended .</l>

     <l n="1931">In her , my mistress , who had had my youth ,</l>
     <l n="1932">To wreak such vengeance on me ? I had erred ,</l>
     <l n="1933">It may be ; but on him , whose was the guilt ,</l>
     <l n="1934">No heaven-sent vengeance lighted , but he sped</l>
     <l n="1935">Away to other hearts across the deep ,</l>
     <l n="1936">Careless and free ; but me , the cold stern eyes</l>
     <l n="1937">Of the pure goddess withered ; and the scorn</l>
     <l n="1938">Of maids , despised before , and the great blank</l>
     <l n="1939">Of love , whose love was gone — this wrung my heart ,</l>
     <l n="1940">And froze my blood ; set on my brow despair ,</l>
     <l n="1941">And turned my gaze to stone , and filled my eyes</l>
     <l n="1942">With horror , and stiffened the soft curls which once</l>
     <l n="1943">Lay smooth and fair into such snake-like rings</l>
     <l n="1944">As made my aspect fearful . All who saw ,</l>
     <l n="1945">Shrank from me and grew cold , and felt the warm ,</l>
     <l n="1946">Full tide of life freeze in them , seeing in me</l>
     <l n="1947">Love 's work , who sat wrapt up and lost in shame ,</l>
     <l n="1948">As in a cloak , consuming my own heart ,</l>
     <l n="1949">And was in hell already . As they gazed</l>
     <l n="1950">Upon me , my despair looked forth so cold</l>
     <l n="1951">From out my eyes , that if some spoiler came</l>
     <l n="1952">Fresh from his wickedness , and looked on them ,</l>
     <l n="1953">Their glare would strike him dead ; and those fair curls</l>
     <l n="1954">Which once the accursed toyed with , grew to be</l>
     <l n="1955">The poisonous things thou seest ; and so , with hate</l>
     <l n="1956">Of man 's injustice and the gods ’ , who knew</l>
     <l n="1957">Me blameless , and yet punished me ; and sick</l>
     <l n="1958">Of life and love , and loathing earth and sky ,</l>
     <l n="1959">And feeding on my sorrow , Hate at last</l>
     <l n="1960">Left me a Fury .</l>
     <l n="1961">Ah , the load of life</l>
     <l n="1962">Which lives for hatred ! We are made to love —</l>
     <l n="1963">We women , and the injury which turns</l>
     <l n="1964">The honey of our lives to gall , transforms</l>
     <l n="1965">The angel to the fiend . For it is sweet</l>
     <l n="1966">To know the dreadful sense of strength , and smite</l>
     <l n="1967">And leave the tyrant dead with a glance ; ay ! sweet ,</l>
     <l n="1968">In that fierce lust of power , to slay the life</l>
     <l n="1969">Which harmed not , when the suppliants ’ cry ascends</l>
     <l n="1970">To ears which hate has deafened . So I lived</l>
     <l n="1971">Long time in misery ; to my sleepless eyes</l>
     <l n="1972">No healing slumbers coming ; but at length ,</l>
     <l n="1973">Zeus and the goddess pitying , I knew</l>
     <l n="1974">Soft rest once more veiling my dreadful gaze</l>
     <l n="1975">In peaceful slumbers . Then a blessed dream</l>
     <l n="1976">I dreamt . For , lo ! a god-like knight in mail</l>
     <l n="1977">Of gold , who sheared with his keen flashing blade ;</l>
     <l n="1978">With scarce a pang of pain , the visage cold</l>
     <l n="1979">Which too great sorrow left me ; at one stroke</l>
     <l n="1980">Clean from the trunk , and then o'er land and sea ,</l>
     <l n="1981">Invisible , sped with winged heels , to where ,</l>
     <l n="1982">Upon a sea-worn cape , a fair young maid ,</l>
     <l n="1983">More blameless even than I was , chained and bound ,</l>

     <l n="1985">In innocent nakedness . Then , as he rose ,</l>
     <l n="1986">Loathsome , from out the depths , a monstrous growth ,</l>
     <l n="1987">A creature wholly serpent , partly man ,</l>
     <l n="1988">The wrongs that I had known , stronger than death ,</l>
     <l n="1989">Rose up with such black hate in me again ,</l>
     <l n="1990">And wreathed such hissing poison through my hair ,</l>
     <l n="1991">And shot such deadly glances from my eyes ,</l>
     <l n="1992">That nought that saw might live . And the vile worm</l>
     <l n="1993">Was slain , and she delivered . Then I dreamt</l>
     <l n="1994">My mistress , whom I thought so stern to me ,</l>

     <l n="2035">Then as I passed</l>

     <l n="2039">And presence of a queen ; and with her walked</l>
     <l n="2040">The fairest youth that ever maiden 's dream</l>
     <l n="2041">Conceived . And as they came , the throng of ghosts ,</l>
     <l n="2042">For these who were not wholly ghosts , arose ,</l>
     <l n="2043">And did them homage . Not the chain of love</l>
     <l n="2044">Bound them , but such calm kinship as is bred</l>
     <l n="2045">Of long and difficult pilgrimages borne</l>
     <l n="2046">Through common perils by two souls which share</l>
     <l n="2047">A common weary exile . Nor as ghosts</l>
     <l n="2048">These showed , but rather like two lives which hung</l>
     <l n="2049">Suspended in a trance . A halo of life</l>
     <l n="2050">Played round them , and they brought a sweet brisk air</l>
     <l n="2051">Tasting of earth and heaven , like sojourners</l>

     <l n="2057">Run faster , while a new strange cycle turns</l>
     <l n="2058">And grows completed . Soon on the dear earth</l>
     <l n="2059">Under the lively light of fuller day ,</l>
     <l n="2060">I shall revive me of my wound ; and thou ,</l>

     <l n="2062">And the grim monster who will fawn on thee ,</l>
     <l n="2063">Shalt issue in royal pomp , and wreathed with flowers ,</l>
     <l n="2064">Upon the cheerful earth , leaving behind</l>
     <l n="2065">A deeper winter for the ghosts who dwell</l>
     <l n="2066">Within these sunless haunts ; and I shall lie</l>
     <l n="2067">Once more within loved arms , and thou shalt see</l>
     <l n="2068">Thy early home , and kiss thy mother 's cheek ,</l>
     <l n="2069">And be a girl again . But not for long ;</l>
     <l n="2070">For ere the bounteous Autumn spreads her hues</l>
     <l n="2071">Of gold and purple , a cold voice will call</l>
     <l n="2072">And bring us to these wintry lands once more ,</l>
     <l n="2073">As erst so often . Blest are we , indeed ,</l>
     <l n="2074">Above the rest , and yet I would I knew</l>
     <l n="2075">The careless joys of old .</l>
     <l n="2076">For in hot youth ,</l>
     <l n="2077">Oh , it was sweet to greet the balmy night</l>
     <l n="2078">That was love 's nurse , and feel the weary eyes</l>
     <l n="2079">Closed by soft kisses ,— sweet at early dawn</l>
     <l n="2080">To wake refreshed and , scarce from loving arms</l>
     <l n="2081">Leaping , to issue forth , with winding horn ,</l>
     <l n="2082">By dewy heath and brake , and taste the fair</l>
     <l n="2083">Young breath of early morning ; and ‘ twas sweet</l>
     <l n="2084">To chase the bounding quarry all day long</l>
     <l n="2085">With my true hounds and rapid steed , and gay</l>
     <l n="2086">Companions of my youth , and with the eve</l>
     <l n="2087">To turn home laden with the spoil , and take</l>
     <l n="2088">The banquet which awaited , and sweet wine</l>
     <l n="2089">Poured out , and kisses pressed on loving lips ;</l>
     <l n="2090">Circled by snowy arms . Oh , it was sweet</l>
     <l n="2091">To be alive and young !</l>
     <l n="2092">For sure it is</l>
     <l n="2093">The gods gave not quick pulses and hot blood</l>
     <l n="2094">And strength and beauty for no end , but would</l>
     <l n="2095">That we should use them wisely ; and the fair ,</l>
     <l n="2096">Sweet mistress of my service was , indeed ,</l>
     <l n="2097">Worthy of all observance . Oh , her eyes</l>
     <l n="2098">When I lay bleeding ! All day long we rode ,</l>
     <l n="2099">I and my youthful peers , with horse and hound ,</l>
     <l n="2100">And knew the joy of swift pursuit and toil</l>
     <l n="2101">And peril . At the last , a fierce boar turned</l>
     <l n="2102">At bay , and with his gleaming tusks o'erthrew</l>
     <l n="2103">My steed , and as I fell upon the flowers ,</l>
     <l n="2104">Pierced me as with a sword . Then , as I lay ,</l>
     <l n="2105">I knew the strange slow chill which , stealing , tells</l>
     <l n="2106">The young that it is death . Yet knew I not</l>
     <l n="2107">Of pain or fear , only great pity , indeed ,</l>
     <l n="2108">That she should lose her love , who was so fond</l>
     <l n="2109">And gracious . But when , lifting my dim gaze ,</l>
     <l n="2110">I saw her bend o'er me ,— the lovely eyes</l>
     <l n="2111">Suffused with tears , and her sweet smile replaced</l>
     <l n="2112">By agonized sorrow ,— for a while I stayed</l>
     <l n="2113">Life 's ebbing tide , and raised my cold , white lips ,</l>
     <l n="2114">With a faint smile , to hers . Then , with a kiss —</l>
     <l n="2115">One long last kiss , we mingled , and I knew</l>
     <l n="2116">No more .</l>
     <l n="2117">But even in death , so strong is Love ,</l>
     <l n="2118">I could not wholly die ; and year by year ,</l>
     <l n="2119">When the bright springtime comes , and the earth lives ,</l>
     <l n="2120">Love opens these dread gates , and calls me forth</l>
     <l n="2121">Across the gulf . Not here , indeed , she comes ,</l>
     <l n="2122">Being a goddess and in heaven , but smooths</l>
     <l n="2123">My path to the old earth , where still I know</l>
     <l n="2124">Once more the sweet lost days , and once again</l>
     <l n="2125">Blossom on that soft breast , and am again</l>
     <l n="2126">A youth , and rapt in love ; and yet not all</l>
     <l n="2127">As careless as of yore ; but seem to know</l>
     <l n="2128">The early spring of passion , tamed by time</l>
     <l n="2129">And suffering , to a calmer , fuller flow ,</l>
     <l n="2130">Less fitful , but more strong . ”</l>
     <l n="2131">Then the sad Queen</l>
     <l n="2132">“ Fair youth , thy lot I know , for I am old</l>
     <l n="2133">As the old earth and yet as young as is</l>
     <l n="2134">The budding spring , and I was here a Queen ,</l>
     <l n="2135">When Love was not or Time , and to my arms</l>
     <l n="2136">Thou camest as a little child , to dwell</l>
     <l n="2137">Within the halls of Death , for without Death</l>
     <l n="2138">There were nor Birth nor Love , nor would Life yearn</l>
     <l n="2139">To lose itself within another life ,</l>
     <l n="2140">And dying , to be born . I , too , have died</l>
     <l n="2141">For love in part , and live again through love ;</l>
     <l n="2142">For in the far-off years , when Time was young ,</l>
     <l n="2143">And Love unborn on earth , and Zeus in heaven</l>
     <l n="2144">Ruled , a young sovereign ; I , a maiden , dwelt</l>
     <l n="2145">With dread Demeter on the lovely plains</l>
     <l n="2146">Of sunny Sicily . There , day by day ,</l>
     <l n="2147">I sported with the maiden goddesses ,</l>
     <l n="2148">In virgin freedom . Budding age made gay</l>
     <l n="2149">Our lightsome feet , and on the flowery slopes</l>
     <l n="2150">We wandered daily , gathering flowers to weave</l>
     <l n="2151">In careless garlands for our locks , and passed</l>
     <l n="2152">The days in innocent gladness . Thought of Love</l>
     <l n="2153">There came not to us , for as yet the earth</l>
     <l n="2154">Was virginal , nor yet had Eros come</l>
     <l n="2155">With his delicious pain .</l>
     <l n="2156">And one fair morn —</l>
     <l n="2157">Not all the ages blot it — on the side</l>
     <l n="2158">Of AEtna we were straying . There was then</l>
     <l n="2159">Summer nor winter , springtide nor the time</l>
     <l n="2160">Of harvest , but the soft unfailing sun</l>
     <l n="2161">Shone always , and the sowing time was one</l>
     <l n="2162">With reaping ; fruit and flower together sprung</l>
     <l n="2163">Upon the trees ; and blade and ripened ear</l>
     <l n="2164">Together clothed the plains . There , as I strayed ,</l>
     <l n="2165">Sudden a black cloud down the rugged side</l>
     <l n="2166">Of AEtna , mixed with fire and dreadful sound</l>
     <l n="2167">Of thunder , rolled around me , and I heard</l>
     <l n="2168">The maids who were my fellows turn and flee</l>
     <l n="2169">With shrieks and cries for me .</l>
     <l n="2170">But I , I knew</l>
     <l n="2171">No terror while the god o'ershadowed me ,</l>
     <l n="2172">Hiding my life in his , nor when I wept</l>
     <l n="2173">My flowers all withered , and my blood ran slow</l>
     <l n="2174">Within a wintry land . Some voice there was</l>
     <l n="2175">Which said , ‘ Fear not . Thou shalt return and see</l>
     <l n="2176">Thy mother again , only a little while</l>
     <l n="2177">Fate wills that thou shouldst tarry , and become</l>
     <l n="2178">Queen of another world . Thou seest that all</l>
     <l n="2179">Thy flowers are faded . They shall live again</l>
     <l n="2180">On earth , as thou shalt , as thou livest now</l>
     <l n="2181">The Life of Death — for what is Death but Life</l>
     <l n="2182">Suspended as in sleep ? The changeless rule</l>
     <l n="2183">Where life was constant , and the sun o'erhead ,</l>
     <l n="2184">Blazed forth for ever , changes and is hidden</l>
     <l n="2185">Awhile . This region which thou seest , where all</l>
     <l n="2186">The trees are lifeless , and the flowers are dead ,</l>
     <l n="2187">Is but the self-same earth on which erewhile</l>
     <l n="2188">Thou sportedst fancy free . ’</l>
     <l n="2189">So , without fear</l>
     <l n="2190">I wandered on this bare land , seeing far</l>
     <l n="2191">Upon the sky the peaks of my own hills</l>
     <l n="2192">And crests of my own woods . Till , when I grew</l>
     <l n="2193">Hungered , ere yet another form I saw ;</l>
     <l n="2194">Along the silent alleys journeying ,</l>
     <l n="2195">And leafless groves ; a fair and mystic tree</l>
     <l n="2196">Rose like a heart in shape , and ‘ mid its leaves</l>
     <l n="2197">One golden mystic fruit with a fair seed</l>
     <l n="2198">Hid in it . This , with childish hand , I took</l>
     <l n="2199">And ate , and straight I knew the tree was Life ,</l>
     <l n="2200">And the fruit Death , and the hid seed was Love .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="41">
     <l n="2201">Ah , sweet strange fruit ! the which if any taste</l>

     <l n="2207">Our life comes to us , though the passion cools ,</l>
     <l n="2208">No , never as before . My mother came</l>
     <l n="2209">Too late to seek me . She had power to raise</l>
     <l n="2210">A life from out Death 's grasp , but from the arms</l>
     <l n="2211">Of Love she might not take me , nor undo</l>
     <l n="2212">Love 's past for all her strength . She came and sought</l>
     <l n="2213">With fires her daughter over land and sea ,</l>
     <l n="2214">Beyond the paths of all the setting stars ,</l>
     <l n="2215">In vain , and over all the earth in vain ,</l>
     <l n="2216">Seeking whom love disguised . Then on all lands</l>
     <l n="2217">She cast the spell of barrenness ; the wheat</l>
     <l n="2218">Was blighted in the ear , the purple grapes</l>
     <l n="2219">Blushed no more on the vines , and all the gods</l>
     <l n="2220">Were sorrowful , seeing the load of ill</l>
     <l n="2221">My rape had laid on men . Last , Zeus himself ,</l>
     <l n="2222">Pitying the evil that was done , sent forth</l>
     <l n="2223">His messenger beyond the western rim</l>
     <l n="2224">To fetch me back to earth .</l>
     <l n="2225">But not the same</l>
     <l n="2226">He found me who had eaten of Love 's seed ,</l>
     <l n="2227">But changed into another ; nor could his power</l>
     <l n="2228">Prevail to keep me wholly on the earth ,</l>
     <l n="2229">Or make me maid again . The wintry life</l>
     <l n="2230">Is homelier often than the summer blaze</l>
     <l n="2231">Of happiness unclouded ; so , when Spring</l>
     <l n="2232">Comes on the world , I , coming , cross with thee ,</l>
     <l n="2233">Year after year , the cruel icy stream ;</l>
     <l n="2234">And leave this anxious sceptre and the shades</l>
     <l n="2235">Of those in hell , or those for whom , though blest ,</l>
     <l n="2236">No Spring comes , till the last great Spring which brings</l>
     <l n="2237">New heavens and new earth ; and lay my head</l>
     <l n="2238">Upon my mother 's bosom , and grow young ,</l>
     <l n="2239">And am a girl again .</l>
     <l n="2240">A soft air breathes</l>
     <l n="2241">Across the stream and fills these barren fields</l>
     <l n="2242">With the sweet odours of the earth . I know</l>
     <l n="2243">Again the perfume of the violets</l>
     <l n="2244">Which bloom on AEtna 's side . Soon we shall pass</l>
     <l n="2245">Together to our home , while round our feet</l>
     <l n="2246">The crocus flames like gold , the wind-flowers white</l>
     <l n="2247">Wave their soft petals on the breeze , and all</l>
     <l n="2248">The choir of flowers lift up their silent song</l>
     <l n="2249">To the unclouded heavens . Thou , fair boy ,</l>
     <l n="2250">Shalt lie within thy love 's white arms again ,</l>
     <l n="2251">And I within my mother 's . Sweet is Love</l>
     <l n="2252">In ceasing and renewal ; nay , in these</l>
     <l n="2253">It lives and has its being . Thou couldst not keep</l>
     <l n="2254">Thy youth as now , if always on the breast</l>
     <l n="2255">Of love too late a lingerer thou hadst known</l>
     <l n="2256">Possession sate thee . Nor might I have kept</l>
     <l n="2257">My mother 's heart , if I had lived to ripe</l>
     <l n="2258">And wither on the stalk . Time calls and Change</l>
     <l n="2259">Commands both men and gods , and speeds us on</l>
     <l n="2260">We know not whither ; but the old earth smiles</l>
     <l n="2261">Spring after Spring , and the seed bursts again</l>
     <l n="2262">Out of its prison mould , and the dead lives</l>
     <l n="2263">Renew themselves , and rise aloft and soar</l>
     <l n="2264">And are transformed , clothing themselves with change</l>
     <l n="2265">Till the last change be done . ”</l>
     <l n="2266">As thus she spake ,</l>
     <l n="2267">I saw a gleam of light flash from the eyes</l>
     <l n="2268">Of all the listening shades , and a great joy</l>
     <l n="2269">Thrill through the realms of Death .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="42">
     <l n="2270">And then again</l>
     <l n="2271">A youthful shade I saw , a comely boy ,</l>
     <l n="2272">With lip and cheek just touched with manly down ,</l>
     <l n="2273">And strong limbs wearing Spring ; in mien and garb</l>
     <l n="2274">A youthful chieftain , with a perfect face</l>
     <l n="2275">Of fresh young beauty , clustered curls divine ,</l>
     <l n="2276">And chiselled features like a sculptured god ,</l>
     <l n="2277">But warm and breathing life ; only the eyes ,</l>
     <l n="2278">The fair large eyes , were full of dreaming thought ,</l>
     <l n="2279">And seemed to gaze beyond the world of sight ,</l>
     <l n="2280">On a hid world of beauty . Him I stayed ,</l>
     <l n="2281">Accosting with soft words of courtesy ;</l>
     <l n="2282">And , on a bank of scentless flowers reclined ,</l>
     <l n="2283">He answered thus :</l>
     <l n="2284">“ Not for the garish sun</l>
     <l n="2285">I long , nor for the splendours of high noon</l>
     <l n="2286">In this dim land I languish ; for of yore</l>
     <l n="2287">Full often , when the swift chase swept along</l>
     <l n="2288">Through the brisk morn , or when my comrades called</l>
     <l n="2289">To wrestling , or the foot-race , or to cleave</l>
     <l n="2290">The sunny stream , I loved to walk apart ,</l>
     <l n="2291">Self-centred , sole ; and when the laughing girls</l>
     <l n="2292">To some fair stripling 's oaten melody</l>
     <l n="2293">Made ready for the dance , I heeded not ;</l>
     <l n="2294">Nor when to the loud trumpet 's blast and blare</l>
     <l n="2295">My peers rode forth to battle . For , one eve ,</l>
     <l n="2296">In Latmos , after a long day in June ,</l>
     <l n="2297">I stayed to rest me on a sylvan hill ,</l>
     <l n="2298">Where often youth and maid were wont to meet</l>
     <l n="2299">Towards moonrise ; and deep slumber fell on me</l>
     <l n="2300">Musing on Love , just as the ruddy orb</l>
     <l n="2301">Rose on the lucid night , set in a frame</l>
     <l n="2302">Of blooming myrtle and sharp tremulous plane ;</l>
     <l n="2303">Deep slumber fell , and loosed my limbs in rest .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="43">
     <l n="2304">Then , as the full orb poised upon the peak ,</l>
     <l n="2305">There came a lovely vision of a maid ,</l>
     <l n="2306">Who seemed to step as from a golden car</l>
     <l n="2307">Out of the low-hung moon . No mortal form ,</l>
     <l n="2308">Such as ofttimes of yore I knew and clasped</l>
     <l n="2309">At twilight ‘ mid the vines at the mad feast</l>
     <l n="2310">Of Dionysus , or the fair maids cold</l>
     <l n="2311">Who streamed in white processions to the shrine</l>
     <l n="2312">Of the chaste Virgin Goddess ; but a shape</l>
     <l n="2313">Richer and yet more pure . No thinnest veil</l>
     <l n="2314">Obscured her ; but each exquisite limb revealed ,</l>
     <l n="2315">Gleamed like a golden statue subtly wrought</l>
     <l n="2316">By a great sculptor on the architrave</l>
     <l n="2317">Of some high temple-front — only in her</l>
     <l n="2318">The form was soft and warm , and charged with life ,</l>
     <l n="2319">And breathing . As I seemed to gaze on her ,</l>
     <l n="2320">Nearer she drew and gazed ; and as I lay</l>
     <l n="2321">Supine , as in a spell , the radiance stooped</l>
     <l n="2322">And kissed me on the lips , a chaste , sweet kiss ,</l>
     <l n="2323">Which drew my spirit with it . So I slept</l>
     <l n="2324">Each night upon the hill , until the dawn</l>
     <l n="2325">Came in her silver chariot from the East ,</l>
     <l n="2326">And chased my Love away . But ever thus</l>
     <l n="2327">Dissolved in love as in a heaven-sent dream ,</l>
     <l n="2328">Whenever the bright circle of the moon</l>
     <l n="2329">Climbed from the hills , whether in leafy June</l>
     <l n="2330">Or harvest-tide , or when they leapt and pressed</l>
     <l n="2331">Red-thighed the spouting must , I walked apart</l>
     <l n="2332">From all , and took no thought for mortal maid ,</l>
     <l n="2333">Nor nimble joys of youth ; but night by night</l>
     <l n="2334">I stole , when all were sleeping , to the hill ,</l>
     <l n="2335">And slumbered and was blest ; until I grew</l>
     <l n="2336">Possest by love so deep , I seemed to live</l>
     <l n="2337">In slumber only , while the waking day</l>
     <l n="2338">Showed faint as any vision .</l>
     <l n="2339">So I turned</l>
     <l n="2340">Paler and paler with the months , and climbed</l>
     <l n="2341">The steep with laboured steps and difficult breath ,</l>
     <l n="2342">But still I climbed . Ay , though the wintry frost</l>
     <l n="2343">Chained fast the streams and whitened all the fields ,</l>
     <l n="2344">I sought my mistress through the leafless groves ,</l>
     <l n="2345">And slumbered and was happy , till the dawn</l>
     <l n="2346">Returning found me stretched out , cold and stark ,</l>
     <l n="2347">With life 's fire nigh burnt out . Till one clear night ,</l>
     <l n="2348">When the birds shivered in the pines , and all</l>
     <l n="2349">The inner heavens stood open , lo ! she came ,</l>
     <l n="2350">Brighter and kinder still , and kissed my eyes</l>
     <l n="2351">And half-closed lips , and drew my soul through them ,</l>
     <l n="2352">And in one precious ecstasy dissolved</l>
     <l n="2353">My life . And thenceforth , ever on the hill</l>
     <l n="2354">I lie unseen of man ; a cold , white form ,</l>
     <l n="2355">Still young , through all the ages ; but my soul ,</l>
     <l n="2356">Clothed in this thin presentment of old days ,</l>
     <l n="2357">Walks this dim land , where never moonrise comes ,</l>
     <l n="2358">Nor day-break , but a twilight waiting-time ,</l>
     <l n="2359">No more ; and , ah ! how weary ! Yet I judge</l>
     <l n="2360">My lot a higher far than his who spends</l>
     <l n="2361">His youth on swift hot pleasure , quickly past ;</l>
     <l n="2362">Or theirs , my equals ’ , who through long calm years</l>
     <l n="2363">Grew sleek in dull content of wedded lives</l>
     <l n="2364">And fair-grown offspring . Many a day for them ,</l>
     <l n="2365">While I was wandering here , and my bones bleached</l>
     <l n="2366">Upon the rocks , the sweet autumnal sun</l>
     <l n="2367">Beamed , and the grapes grew purple . Many a day</l>
     <l n="2368">They heaped up gold , they knelt at festivals ,</l>
     <l n="2369">They waxed in high report and fame of men ,</l>
     <l n="2370">They gave their girls in marriage ; while for me</l>
     <l n="2371">Upon the untrodden peaks , the cold , grey morn ,</l>
     <l n="2372">The snows , the rains , the winds , the untempered blaze ,</l>
     <l n="2373">Beat year by year , until I turned to stone ,</l>
     <l n="2374">And the great eagles shrieked at me , and wheeled</l>
     <l n="2375">Affrighted . Yet I judge it better indeed</l>
     <l n="2376">To seek in life , as now I know I sought ,</l>
     <l n="2377">Some fair impossible Love , which slays our life ,</l>
     <l n="2378">Some fair ideal raised too high for man ;</l>
     <l n="2379">And failing to grow mad , and cease to be ,</l>
     <l n="2380">Than to decline , as they do who have found</l>
     <l n="2381">Broad-paunched content and weal and happiness :</l>
     <l n="2382">And so an end . For one day , as I know ,</l>
     <l n="2383">The high aim unfulfilled fulfils itself ;</l>
     <l n="2384">The deep , unsatisfied thirst is satisfied ;</l>
     <l n="2385">And through this twilight , broken suddenly ,</l>
     <l n="2386">The inmost heaven , the lucent stars of God ,</l>
     <l n="2387">The Moon of Love , the Sun of Life ; and I ,</l>
     <l n="2388">I who pine here — I on the Latmian hill</l>
     <l n="2389">Shall soar aloft and find them . ”</l>
     <l n="2390">With the word ,</l>
     <l n="2391">There beamed a shaft of dawn athwart the skies ,</l>
     <l n="2392">And straight the sentinel thrush within the yew</l>
     <l n="2393">Sang out reveille to the hosts of day ,</l>
     <l n="2394">Soldierly ; and the pomp and rush of life</l>
     <l n="2395">Began once more , and left me there alone</l>
     <l n="2396">Amid the awaking world .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="44">
     <l n="2397">Nay , not alone .</l>
     <l n="2398">One fair shade lingered in the fuller day ,</l>
     <l n="2399">The last to come , when now my dream had grown</l>
     <l n="2400">Half mixed with waking thoughts , as grows a dream</l>
     <l n="2401">In summer mornings when the broader light</l>
     <l n="2402">Dazzles the sleeper 's eyes ; and is most fair</l>
     <l n="2403">Of all and best remembered , and becomes</l>
     <l n="2404">Part of our waking life , when older dreams</l>
     <l n="2405">Grow fainter , and are fled . So this remained</l>
     <l n="2406">The fairest of the visions that I knew ,</l>
     <l n="2407">Most precious and most dear .</l>
     <l n="2408">The increasing light</l>
     <l n="2409">Shone through her , finer than the thinnest shade ,</l>
     <l n="2410">And yet most full of beauty ; golden wings ,</l>
     <l n="2411">From her fair shoulders springing , seemed to lift</l>
     <l n="2412">Her stainless feet from the cold ground and snatch</l>
     <l n="2413">Their wearer into air ; and in her eyes</l>
     <l n="2414">Was such fair glance as comes from virgin love ,</l>
     <l n="2415">Long chastened and triumphant . Every trace</l>
     <l n="2416">Of earth had vanished from her , and she showed</l>
     <l n="2417">As one who walks a saint already in life ,</l>
     <l n="2418">Virgin or mother . Immortality</l>
     <l n="2419">Breathed from those radiant eyes which yet had passed</l>
     <l n="2420">Between the gates of death . I seemed to hear</l>
     <l n="2421">The Soul of mortals speaking :</l>
     <l n="2422">“ I was born</l>
     <l n="2423">Of a great race and mighty , and was grown</l>
     <l n="2424">Fair , as they said , and good , and kept a life</l>
     <l n="2425">Pure from all stain of passion . Love I knew not ,</l>
     <l n="2426">Who was absorbed in duty ; and the Mother</l>
     <l n="2427">Of gods and men , seeing my life more calm</l>
     <l n="2428">Than human , hating my impassive heart ,</l>
     <l n="2429">Sent down her perfect son in wrath to earth ,</l>
     <l n="2430">And bade him break me .</l>
     <l n="2431">But when Eros came ,</l>
     <l n="2432">It did repent him of the task , for Love</l>
     <l n="2433">Is kin to Duty .</l>
     <l n="2434">And within my life</l>
     <l n="2435">I knew miraculous change , and a soft flame</l>
     <l n="2436">Wherefrom the snows of Duty flushed to rose ,</l>
     <l n="2437">And the chill icy flow of mind was turned</l>
     <l n="2438">To a warm stream of passion . Long I lived</l>
     <l n="2439">Not knowing what had been , nor recognized</l>
     <l n="2440">A Presence walking with me through my life ,</l>
     <l n="2441">As if by night , his face and form concealed :</l>
     <l n="2442">A gracious voice alone , which none but I</l>
     <l n="2443">Might hear , sustained me , and its name was Love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="45">
     <l n="2444">Not as the earthly loves which throb and flush</l>
     <l n="2445">Round earthly shrines was mine , but a pure spirit ,</l>
     <l n="2446">Lovelier than all embodied love , more pure</l>
     <l n="2447">And wonderful ; but never on his eyes</l>
     <l n="2448">I looked , which still were hidden , and I knew not</l>
     <l n="2449">The fashion of his nature ; for by night ,</l>
     <l n="2450">When visual eyes are blind , but the soul sees ,</l>
     <l n="2451">Came he , and bade me seek not to enquire</l>
     <l n="2452">Or whence he came or wherefore . Nor knew I</l>
     <l n="2453">His name . And always ere the coming day ,</l>
     <l n="2454">As if he were the Sun-god , lingering</l>
     <l n="2455">With some too well-loved maiden , he would rise</l>
     <l n="2456">And vanish until eve . But all my being</l>
     <l n="2457">Thrilled with my fair unearthly visitant</l>
     <l n="2458">To higher duty and more glorious meed</l>
     <l n="2459">Of action than of old , for it was Love</l>
     <l n="2460">That came to me , who might not know his name .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="46">
     <l n="2461">Thus , ever rapt by dreams divine , I knew</l>
     <l n="2462">The scorn that comes from weaker souls , which miss ,</l>
     <l n="2463">Being too low of nature , the great joy</l>
     <l n="2464">Revealed to others higher ; nay , my sisters ,</l>
     <l n="2465">Who being of one blood with me , made choice</l>
     <l n="2466">To tread the lower ways of daily life ,</l>
     <l n="2467">Grew jealous of me , bidding me take heed</l>
     <l n="2468">Lest haply ‘ twas some monstrous fiend I loved ,</l>
     <l n="2469">Such as in fable ofttimes sought and won</l>
     <l n="2470">The innocent hearts of maids . Long time I held</l>
     <l n="2471">My love too dear for doubt , who was so sweet</l>
     <l n="2472">And lovable . But at the last the sneers ,</l>
     <l n="2473">The mystery which hid him , the swift flight</l>
     <l n="2474">Before the coming dawn , the shape concealed ,</l>
     <l n="2475">The curious girlish heart , these worked on me</l>
     <l n="2476">With an unsatisfied thirst . Not his own words :</l>
     <l n="2477">‘ Dear , I am with thee only while I keep</l>
     <l n="2478">My visage hidden ; and if thou once shouldst see</l>
     <l n="2479">My face , I must forsake thee : the high gods</l>
     <l n="2480">Link Love with Faith , and he withdraws himself</l>
     <l n="2481">From the full gaze of Knowledge ’ — not even these</l>
     <l n="2482">Could cure me of my longing , or the fear</l>
     <l n="2483">Those mocking voices worked ; who fain would learn</l>
     <l n="2484">The worst that might befall .</l>
     <l n="2485">And one sad night ,</l>
     <l n="2486">Just as the day leapt from the hills and brought</l>
     <l n="2487">The hour when he should go : with tremulous hands ,</l>
     <l n="2488">Lighting my midnight lamp in fear , I stood</l>
     <l n="2489">Long time uncertain , and at length turned round</l>
     <l n="2490">And gazed upon my love . He lay asleep ,</l>
     <l n="2491">And oh , how fair he was ! The flickering light</l>
     <l n="2492">Fell on the fairest of the gods , stretched out</l>
     <l n="2493">In happy slumber . Looking on his locks</l>
     <l n="2494">Of gold , and faultless face and smile , and limbs</l>
     <l n="2495">Made perfect , a great joy and trembling took me</l>
     <l n="2496">Who was most blest of women , and in awe</l>
     <l n="2497">And fear I stooped to kiss him . One warm drop —</l>
     <l n="2498">From the full lamp within my trembling hand ,</l>
     <l n="2499">Or a glad tear from my too happy eyes ,</l>
     <l n="2500">Fell on his shoulder .</l>
     <l n="2501">Then the god unclosed</l>
     <l n="2502">His lovely eyes , and with great pity spake :</l>
     <l n="2503">‘ Farewell ! There is no Love except with Faith ,</l>
     <l n="2504">And thine is dead ! Farewell ! I come no more . ’</l>

     <l n="2506">Leapt up , and as I clasped my love again ,</l>
     <l n="2507">The lovely vision faded from his place ,</l>
     <l n="2508">And came no more .</l>
     <l n="2509">Then I , with breaking heart ,</l>
     <l n="2510">Knowing my life laid waste by my own hand ,</l>
     <l n="2511">Went forth and would have sought to hide my life</l>
     <l n="2512">Within the stream of Death ; but Death came not</l>
     <l n="2513">To aid me who not yet was meet for Death .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="47">
     <l n="2514">Then finding that Love came not back to me ,</l>
     <l n="2515">I thought that in the temples of the gods</l>
     <l n="2516">Haply he dwelt , and so from fane to fane</l>
     <l n="2517">I wandered over earth , and knelt in each ,</l>
     <l n="2518">Enquiring for my Love ; and I would ask</l>
     <l n="2519">The priests and worshippers , ‘ Is this Love 's shrine ?</l>
     <l n="2520">Sirs , have you seen the god ? ’ But never at all</l>
     <l n="2521">I found him . For some answered , ‘ This is called</l>
     <l n="2522">The Shrine of Knowledge ; ’ and another , ‘ This ,</l>
     <l n="2523">The Shrine of Beauty ; ’ and another , ‘ Strength ; ’</l>
     <l n="2524">And yet another , ‘ Youth . ’ And I would kneel</l>
     <l n="2525">And say a prayer to my Love , and rise</l>
     <l n="2526">And seek another . Long , o'er land and sea ,</l>
     <l n="2527">I wandered , till I was not young or fair ,</l>
     <l n="2528">Grown wretched , seeking my lost Love ; and last ,</l>
     <l n="2529">Came to the smiling , hateful shrine where ruled</l>
     <l n="2530">The queen of earthly love and all delight ,</l>
     <l n="2531">Cypris , but knelt not there , but asked of one</l>
     <l n="2532">Who seemed her priest , if Eros dwelt with her .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="48">
     <l n="2533">Then to the subtle-smiling goddess ’ self</l>
     <l n="2534">They led me . She with hatred in her eyes :</l>
     <l n="2535">‘ What ! thou to seek for Love , who art grown thin</l>
     <l n="2536">And pale with watching ! He is not for thee .</l>
     <l n="2537">What Love is left for such ? Thou didst despise</l>
     <l n="2538">Love , and didst dwell apart . Love sits within</l>
     <l n="2539">The young maid 's eyes , making them beautiful .</l>
     <l n="2540">Love is for youth , and joy , and happiness ;</l>
     <l n="2541">And not for withered lives . Ho ! bind her fast .</l>
     <l n="2542">Take her and set her to the vilest tasks ,</l>
     <l n="2543">And bend her pride by solitude and tears ,</l>
     <l n="2544">Who will not kneel to me , but dares to seek</l>
     <l n="2545">A disembodied love . My son has gone</l>
     <l n="2546">And left thee for thy fault , and thou shalt know</l>
     <l n="2547">The misery of my thralls . ’</l>
     <l n="2548">Then in her house</l>
     <l n="2549">They bound me to hard tasks and vile , and kept</l>
     <l n="2550">My life from honour , chained among her slaves</l>
     <l n="2551">And lowest ministers , taking despite</l>
     <l n="2552">And injury for food , and set to bind</l>
     <l n="2553">Their wounds whom she had tortured , and to feed</l>
     <l n="2554">The pitiful lives which in her prisons pent</l>
     <l n="2555">Languished in hopeless pain . There is no sight</l>
     <l n="2556">Of suffering but I saw it , and was set</l>
     <l n="2557">To succour it ; and all my woman 's heart</l>
     <l n="2558">Was torn with the ineffable miseries</l>
     <l n="2559">Which love and life have worked ; and dwelt long time</l>
     <l n="2560">In groanings and in tears .</l>
     <l n="2561">And then , oh joy !</l>
     <l n="2562">Oh miracle ! once more at length again</l>
     <l n="2563">I felt Love 's arms around me , and the kiss</l>
     <l n="2564">Of Love upon my lips , and in the chill</l>
     <l n="2565">Of deepest prison cells , ‘ mid vilest tasks ,</l>
     <l n="2566">The glow of his sweet breath , and the warm touch</l>
     <l n="2567">Of his invisible hand , and his sweet voice ,</l>
     <l n="2568">Ay , sweeter than of old , and tenderer ,</l>
     <l n="2569">Speak to me , pierce me , hold me , fold me round</l>
     <l n="2570">With arms Divine , till all the sordid earth</l>
     <l n="2571">Was hued like heaven , and Life 's dull prison-house</l>
     <l n="2572">Turned to a golden palace , and those low tasks</l>
     <l n="2573">Grew to be higher works and nobler gains</l>
     <l n="2574">Than any gains of knowledge , and at last</l>
     <l n="2575">He whispered softly , ‘ Dear , unclose thine eyes .</l>
     <l n="2576">Thou mayst look on me now . I go no more ,</l>
     <l n="2577">But am thine own for ever . ’</l>
     <l n="2578">Then with wings</l>
     <l n="2579">Of gold we soared , I looking in his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="2580">Over yon dark broad river , and this dim land ,</l>
     <l n="2581">Scarce for an instant staying till we reached</l>
     <l n="2582">The inmost courts of heaven .</l>
     <l n="2583">But sometimes still</l>
     <l n="2584">I come here for a little , and speak a word</l>
     <l n="2585">Of peace to those who wait . The slow wheel turns ,</l>
     <l n="2586">The cycles round themselves and grow complete ,</l>
     <l n="2587">The world 's year whitens to the harvest-tide ,</l>
     <l n="2588">And one word only am I sent to say</l>
     <l n="2589">To those dear souls , who wait here , or who now</l>
     <l n="2590">Breathe earthly air — one universal word</l>
     <l n="2591">To all things living , and the word is ‘ Love . ’ ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="49">
     <l n="2592">Then soared she visibly before my gaze ,</l>
     <l n="2593">And the heavens took her , and I knew my eyes</l>
     <l n="2594">Had seen the soul of man , the deathless soul ,</l>
     <l n="2595">Defeated , struggling , purified , and blest .</l>

     <l n="2597">Heroes and queens , fair maidens and brave youths ,</l>
     <l n="2598">Swept by me , rhythmic , slow , as if they trod</l>
     <l n="2599">Some unheard measure , passing where I stood</l>
     <l n="2600">In fair procession , each with a faint smile</l>
     <l n="2601">Upon the lip , signing “ Farewell , oh shade !</l>
     <l n="2602">It shall be well with thee , as ‘ tis with us ,</l>
     <l n="2603">If only thou art true . The world of Life ,</l>
     <l n="2604">The world of Death , are but opposing sides</l>
     <l n="2605">Of one great orb , and the Light shines on both .</l>
     <l n="2606">Oh , happy happy shade ! Farewell ! Farewell ! ”</l>

     <l n="1">But I , my gaze</l>
     <l n="2">Following the soaring soul which now was lost</l>
     <l n="3">In the awakening skies , floated with her ,</l>
     <l n="4">As in a trance , beyond the golden gates</l>
     <l n="5">Which separate Earth from Heaven ; and to my thought</l>
     <l n="6">Gladdened by that broad effluence of light ,</l>
     <l n="7">This old earth seemed transfigured , and the fields ,</l>
     <l n="8">So dim and bare , grew green and clothed themselves</l>
     <l n="9">With lustrous hues . A fine ethereal air</l>
     <l n="10">Played round me as I mused , and filled the soul</l>
     <l n="11">With an ineffable content . What need</l>

     <l n="13">Or seek to engrave upon the treacherous thought</l>

     <l n="18">One only and no more , which year by year</l>
     <l n="19">In springtime comes , when lingering winter flies ,</l>
     <l n="20">And lo ! the trees blossom in white and pink .</l>
     <l n="21">And golden clusters , and the glades are filled</l>
     <l n="22">With delicate primrose and deep odorous beds</l>

     <l n="29">Flood the green dells with joy , and thro ’ the dry</l>

     <l n="38">Of the beautiful fair world .</l>
     <l n="39">A springtide land</l>

     <l n="43">Rippled in glancing silver , and above ,</l>

     <l n="47">Lighted it , for no turn of dawn and eve</l>

     <l n="55">The Immortals lay . Hard by , a murmurous stream</l>

     <l n="58">The mystic mountain soared . Height after height</l>
     <l n="59">Of bare rock ledges left the climbing pines ,</l>
     <l n="60">And reared their giddy , shining terraces</l>
     <l n="61">Into the ethereal air . Above , the snows</l>

     <l n="63">Which always clothed it round .</l>

     <l n="68">Heroic and Divine , as when , in days</l>
     <l n="69">When Man was young , and Time , the vivid thought</l>
     <l n="70">Translated into Form the unattained</l>
     <l n="71">Impossible Beauty of men 's dreams , and fixed</l>

     <l n="77">To where I trembled . And I knew the face</l>
     <l n="78">And form of Artemis , the fair , the pure ,</l>
     <l n="79">The undefiled . A crescent silvery moon</l>
     <l n="80">Shone thro ’ her locks , and by her side she bore</l>
     <l n="81">A quiver of golden darts . At sight of whom</l>
     <l n="82">I felt a sudden chill , like his who once</l>
     <l n="83">Looked upon her and died ; yet could not fear ,</l>
     <l n="84">Seeing how fair she was . Her sweet voice rang</l>
     <l n="85">Clear as a bird 's :</l>
     <l n="86">“ Mortal , what fate hath brought</l>

     <l n="766">White mists of early morn , yet do we find</l>
     <l n="767">Achievement its own guerdon , and at last</l>
     <l n="768">The rounder song of manhood grows more sweet</l>
     <l n="769">Than the high note of youth .</l>
     <l n="770">For Age , long Age !</l>
     <l n="771">Nought else divides us from the fresh young days</l>
     <l n="772">Which men call ancient ; seeing that we in turn</l>
     <l n="773">Shall one day be Time 's ancients , and inspire</l>
     <l n="774">The wiser , higher race , which yet shall sing</l>
     <l n="775">Because to sing is human , and high thought</l>
     <l n="776">Grows rhythmic ere its close . Nought else there is</l>
     <l n="777">But that weird beat of Time , which doth disjoin</l>
     <l n="778">To-day from Hellas .</l>
     <l n="779">How should any hold</l>
     <l n="780">Those precious scriptures only old-world tales</l>
     <l n="781">Of strange impossible torments and false gods ;</l>
     <l n="782">Of men and monsters in some brainless dream ,</l>
     <l n="783">Coherent , yet unmeaning , linked together</l>
     <l n="784">By some false skein of song ?</l>
     <l n="785">Nay ! evermore ,</l>
     <l n="786">All things and thoughts , both new and old , are writ</l>
     <l n="787">Upon the unchanging human heart and soul .</l>
     <l n="788">Has Passion still no prisoners ? Pine there now</l>
     <l n="789">No lives which fierce Love , sinking into Lust ,</l>
     <l n="790">Has drowned at last in tears and blood — plunged down</l>
     <l n="791">To the lowest depths of Hell ? Have not strong Will</l>
     <l n="792">And high Ambition rotted into Greed</l>
     <l n="793">And Wrong , for any , as of old , and whelmed</l>
     <l n="794">The struggling soul in ruin ? Hell lies near</l>
     <l n="795">Around us as does Heaven , and in the World ,</l>
     <l n="796">Which is our Hades , still the chequered souls</l>
     <l n="797">Compact of good and ill — not all accurst</l>
     <l n="798">Nor altogether blest — a few brief years</l>
     <l n="799">Travel the little journey of their lives ,</l>
     <l n="800">They know not to what end . The weary woman</l>
     <l n="801">Sunk deep in ease and sated with her life ,</l>
     <l n="802">Much loved and yet unloving , pines to-day</l>
     <l n="803">As Helen ; still the poet strives and sings .</l>
     <l n="804">And hears Apollo 's music , and grows dumb ,</l>
     <l n="805">And suffers , yet is happy ; still the young</l>
     <l n="806">Fond dreamer seeks his high ideal love ,</l>
     <l n="807">And finds her name is Death ; still doth the fair</l>
     <l n="808">And innocent life , bound naked to the rock ,</l>
     <l n="809">Redeem the race ; still the gay tempter goes</l>
     <l n="810">And leaves his victim , stone ; still doth pain bind</l>
     <l n="811">Men 's souls in closer links of lovingness ,</l>
     <l n="812">Than Death itself can sever ; still the sight</l>
     <l n="813">Of too great beauty blinds us , and we lose</l>
     <l n="814">The sense of earthly splendours , gaining Heaven .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="33">
     <l n="815">And still the skies are opened as of old</l>
     <l n="816">To the entranced gaze , ay , nearer far</l>
     <l n="817">And brighter than of yore ; and Might is there ,</l>
     <l n="818">And Infinite Purity is there , and high</l>
     <l n="819">Eternal Wisdom , and the calm clear face</l>
     <l n="820">Of Duty , and a higher , stronger Love</l>
     <l n="821">And Light in one , and a new , reverend Name ,</l>
     <l n="822">Greater than any and combining all ;</l>
     <l n="823">And over all , veiled with a veil of cloud ,</l>
     <l n="824">God set far off , too bright for mortal eyes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="34">
     <l n="825">And always , always , with each soul that comes</l>
     <l n="826">And goes , comes that fair form which was my guide ,</l>
     <l n="827">Hovering , with golden wings and eyes divine ,</l>
     <l n="828">Above the bed of birth , the bed of death ,</l>
     <l n="829">Still breathing heavenly airs of deathless love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="35">
     <l n="830">For while a youth is lost in soaring thought ,</l>
     <l n="831">And while a maid grows sweet and beautiful ,</l>
     <l n="832">And while a spring-tide coming lights the earth ,</l>
     <l n="833">And while a child , and while a flower is born ,</l>
     <l n="834">And while one wrong cries for redress and finds</l>
     <l n="835">A soul to answer , still the world is young !</l>
    </lg>
