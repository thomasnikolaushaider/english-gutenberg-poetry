    <p>TO MY MOTHER Love that holds life and death in fee , Deep as the clear unsounded sea And sweet as life or death can be , Lays here my hope , my heart , and me Before you , silent , in a song . Since the old wild tale , made new , found grace , When half sung through , before your face , It needs must live a springtide space , While April suns grow strong .</p>

    <head>I</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In hawthorn-time the heart grows light ,</l>
     <l n="2">The world is sweet in sound and sight ,</l>
     <l n="3">Glad thoughts and birds take flower and flight ,</l>
     <l n="4">The heather kindles toward the light ,</l>
     <l n="5">The whin is frankincense and flame .</l>
     <l n="6">And be it for strife or be it for love</l>
     <l n="7">The falcon quickens as the dove</l>
     <l n="8">When earth is touched from heaven above</l>
     <l n="9">With joy that knows no name .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">And glad in spirit and sad in soul</l>
     <l n="11">With dream and doubt of days that roll</l>
     <l n="12">As waves that race and find no goal</l>
     <l n="13">Rode on by bush and brake and bole</l>
     <l n="14">A northern child of earth and sea .</l>
     <l n="15">The pride of life before him lay</l>
     <l n="16">Radiant : the heavens of night and day</l>
     <l n="17">Shone less than shone before his way</l>
     <l n="18">His ways and days to be .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">And all his life of blood and breath</l>
     <l n="20">Sang out within him : time and death</l>
     <l n="21">Were even as words a dreamer saith</l>
     <l n="22">When sleep within him slackeneth ,</l>
     <l n="23">And light and life and spring were one .</l>
     <l n="24">The steed between his knees that sprang ,</l>
     <l n="25">The moors and woods that shone and sang ,</l>
     <l n="26">The hours where through the spring ’ s breath rang ,</l>
     <l n="27">Seemed ageless as the sun .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="28">But alway through the bounteous bloom</l>
     <l n="29">That earth gives thanks if heaven illume</l>
     <l n="30">His soul forefelt a shadow of doom ,</l>
     <l n="31">His heart foreknew a gloomier gloom</l>
     <l n="32">Than closes all men ’ s equal ways ,</l>
     <l n="33">Albeit the spirit of life ’ s light spring</l>
     <l n="34">With pride of heart upheld him , king</l>
     <l n="35">And lord of hours like snakes that sting</l>
     <l n="36">And nights that darken days .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="37">And as the strong spring round him grew</l>
     <l n="38">Stronger , and all blithe winds that blew</l>
     <l n="39">Blither , and flowers that flowered anew</l>
     <l n="40">More glad of sun and air and dew ,</l>
     <l n="41">The shadow lightened on his soul</l>
     <l n="42">And brightened into death and died</l>
     <l n="43">Like winter , as the bloom waxed wide</l>
     <l n="44">From woodside on to riverside</l>
     <l n="45">And southward goal to goal .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="46">Along the wandering ways of Tyne ,</l>
     <l n="47">By beech and birch and thorn that shine</l>
     <l n="48">And laugh when life ’ s requickening wine</l>
     <l n="49">Makes night and noon and dawn divine</l>
     <l n="50">And stirs in all the veins of spring ,</l>
     <l n="51">And past the brightening banks of Tees ,</l>
     <l n="52">He rode as one that breathes and sees</l>
     <l n="53">A sun more blithe , a merrier breeze ,</l>
     <l n="54">A life that hails him king .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="55">And down the softening south that knows</l>
     <l n="56">No more how glad the heather glows ,</l>
     <l n="57">Nor how , when winter ’ s clarion blows</l>
     <l n="58">Across the bright Northumbrian snows ,</l>
     <l n="59">Sea-mists from east and westward meet ,</l>
     <l n="60">Past Avon senseless yet of song</l>
     <l n="61">And Thames that bore but swans in throng</l>
     <l n="62">He rode elate in heart and strong</l>
     <l n="63">In trust of days as sweet .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="64">So came he through to Camelot ,</l>
     <l n="65">Glad , though for shame his heart waxed hot ,</l>
     <l n="66">For hope within it withered not</l>
     <l n="67">To see the shaft it dreamed of shot</l>
     <l n="68">Fair toward the glimmering goal of fame ,</l>
     <l n="69">And all King Arthur ’ s knightliest there</l>
     <l n="70">Approved him knightly , swift to dare</l>
     <l n="71">And keen to bid their records bear</l>
     <l n="72">Sir Balen ’ s northern name .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="73">Sir Balen of Northumberland</l>
     <l n="74">Gat grace before the king to stand</l>
     <l n="75">High as his heart was , and his hand</l>
     <l n="76">Wrought honour toward the strange north strand</l>
     <l n="77">That sent him south so goodly a knight .</l>
     <l n="78">And envy , sick with sense of sin ,</l>
     <l n="79">Began as poisonous herbs begin</l>
     <l n="80">To work in base men ’ s blood , akin</l>
     <l n="81">To men ’ s of nobler might .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="82">And even so fell it that his doom ,</l>
     <l n="83">For all his bright life ’ s kindling bloom</l>
     <l n="84">And light that took no thought for gloom ,</l>
     <l n="85">Fell as a breath from the opening tomb</l>
     <l n="86">Full on him ere he wist or thought .</l>
     <l n="87">For once a churl of royal seed ,</l>
     <l n="88">King Arthur ’ s kinsman , faint in deed</l>
     <l n="89">And loud in word that knew not heed ,</l>
     <l n="90">Spake shame where shame was nought .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="91">“ What doth one here in Camelot</l>
     <l n="92">Whose birth was northward ? Wot we not</l>
     <l n="93">As all his brethren borderers wot</l>
     <l n="94">How blind of heart , how keen and hot ,</l>
     <l n="95">The wild north lives and hates the south ?</l>
     <l n="96">Men of the narrowing march that knows</l>
     <l n="97">Nought save the strength of storms and snows ,</l>
     <l n="98">What would these carles where knighthood blows</l>
     <l n="99">A trump of kinglike mouth ?”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="100">Swift from his place leapt Balen , smote</l>
     <l n="101">The liar across his face , and wrote</l>
     <l n="102">His wrath in blood upon the bloat</l>
     <l n="103">Brute cheek that challenged shame for note</l>
     <l n="104">How vile a king-born knave might be .</l>
     <l n="105">Forth sprang their swords , and Balen slew</l>
     <l n="106">The knave ere well one witness knew</l>
     <l n="107">Of all that round them stood or drew</l>
     <l n="108">What sight was there to see .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="109">Then spake the great king ’ s wrathful will</l>
     <l n="110">A doom for six dark months to fill</l>
     <l n="111">Wherein close prison held him , still</l>
     <l n="112">And steadfast-souled for good or ill .</l>
     <l n="113">But when those weary days lay dead</l>
     <l n="114">His lordliest knights and barons spake</l>
     <l n="115">Before the king for Balen ’ s sake</l>
     <l n="116">Good speech and wise , of force to break</l>
     <l n="117">The bonds that bowed his head .</l>

     <head>II</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="14">
      <l n="118">In linden-time the heart is high</l>
      <l n="119">For pride of summer passing by</l>
      <l n="120">With lordly laughter in her eye ;</l>
      <l n="121">A heavy splendour in the sky</l>
      <l n="122">Uplifts and bows it down again .</l>
      <l n="123">The spring had waned from wood and wold</l>
      <l n="124">Since Balen left his prison hold</l>
      <l n="125">And lowlier-hearted than of old</l>
      <l n="126">Beheld it wax and wane .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="15">
      <l n="127">Though humble heart and poor array</l>
      <l n="128">Kept not from spirit and sense away</l>
      <l n="129">Their noble nature , nor could slay</l>
      <l n="130">The pride they bade but pause and stay</l>
      <l n="131">Till time should bring its trust to flower ,</l>
      <l n="132">Yet even for noble shame ’ s sake , born</l>
      <l n="133">Of hope that smiled on hate and scorn ,</l>
      <l n="134">He held him still as earth ere morn</l>
      <l n="135">Ring forth her rapturous hour .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="16">
      <l n="136">But even as earth when dawn takes flight</l>
      <l n="137">And beats her wings of dewy light</l>
      <l n="138">Full in the faltering face of night ,</l>
      <l n="139">His soul awoke to claim by right</l>
      <l n="140">The life and death of deed and doom ,</l>
      <l n="141">When once before the king there came</l>
      <l n="142">A maiden clad with grief and shame</l>
      <l n="143">And anguish burning her like flame</l>
      <l n="144">That feeds on flowers in bloom .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="17">
      <l n="145">Beneath a royal mantle , fair</l>
      <l n="146">With goodly work of lustrous vair ,</l>
      <l n="147">Girt fast against her side she bare</l>
      <l n="148">A sword whose weight bade all men there</l>
      <l n="149">Quail to behold her face again .</l>
      <l n="150">Save of a passing perfect knight</l>
      <l n="151">Not great alone in force and fight</l>
      <l n="152">It might not be for any might</l>
      <l n="153">Drawn forth , and end her pain .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="18">
      <l n="154">So said she : then King Arthur spake :</l>

      <l n="158">Assay if better none may be .”</l>
      <l n="159">By girdle and by sheath he caught</l>
      <l n="160">The sheathed and girded sword , and wrought</l>
      <l n="161">With strength whose force availed him nought</l>
      <l n="162">To save and set her free .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="19">
      <l n="163">Again she spake : “ No need to set</l>
      <l n="164">The might that man has matched not yet</l>
      <l n="165">Against it : he whose hand shall get</l>
      <l n="166">Grace to release the bonds that fret</l>
      <l n="167">My bosom and my girdlestead</l>
      <l n="168">With little strain of strength or strife</l>
      <l n="169">Shall bring me as from death to life</l>
      <l n="170">And win to sister or to wife</l>
      <l n="171">Fame that outlives men dead .”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="20">
      <l n="172">Then bade the king his knights assay</l>
      <l n="173">This mystery that before him lay</l>
      <l n="174">And mocked his might of manhood . “ Nay ,”</l>
      <l n="175">Quoth she , “ the man that takes away</l>
      <l n="176">This burden laid on me must be</l>
      <l n="177">A knight of record clean and fair</l>
      <l n="178">As sunlight and the flowerful air ,</l>
      <l n="179">By sire and mother born to bear</l>

     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="21">
      <l n="181">Then forth strode Launcelot , and laid</l>

      <l n="185">Against the hilt that yielded not .</l>
      <l n="186">Then Tristram , bright and sad and kind</l>
      <l n="187">As one that bore in noble mind</l>
      <l n="188">Love that made light as darkness blind ,</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="22">
      <l n="190">Then Lamoracke , with hardier cheer ,</l>
