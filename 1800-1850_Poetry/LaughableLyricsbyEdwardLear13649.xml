    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">When awful darkness and silence reign</l>
     <l n="3">Over the great Gromboolian plain ,</l>
     <l n="4">Through the long , long wintry nights ;</l>
     <l n="5">When the angry breakers roar</l>
     <l n="6">As they beat on the rocky shore ;</l>
     <l n="7">When Storm-clouds brood on the towering heights</l>
     <l n="8">Of the Hills of the Chankly Bore ,—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Then , through the vast and gloomy dark</l>
     <l n="10">There moves what seems a fiery spark ,—</l>
     <l n="11">A lonely spark with silvery rays</l>
     <l n="12">Piercing the coal-black night ,—</l>
     <l n="13">A Meteor strange and bright :</l>
     <l n="14">Hither and thither the vision strays ,</l>
     <l n="15">A single lurid light .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="16">Slowly it wanders , pauses , creeps ,—</l>
     <l n="17">Anon it sparkles , flashes , and leaps ;</l>
     <l n="18">And ever as onward it gleaming goes</l>
     <l n="19">A light on the Bong-tree stems it throws .</l>
     <l n="20">And those who watch at that midnight hour</l>
     <l n="21">From Hall or Terrace or lofty Tower ,</l>
     <l n="22">Cry , as the wild light passes along ,—</l>
     <l n="23">“ The Dong ! the Dong !</l>
     <l n="24">The wandering Dong through the forest goes !</l>
     <l n="25">The Dong ! the Dong !</l>
     <l n="26">The Dong with a luminous Nose ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="27">Long years ago</l>
     <l n="28">The Dong was happy and gay ,</l>
     <l n="29">Till he fell in love with a Jumbly Girl</l>
     <l n="30">Who came to those shores one day .</l>
     <l n="31">For the Jumblies came in a sieve , they did ,—</l>
     <l n="32">Landing at eve near the Zemmery Fidd</l>
     <l n="33">Where the Oblong Oysters grow ,</l>
     <l n="34">And the rocks are smooth and gray .</l>
     <l n="35">And all the woods and the valleys rang</l>
     <l n="36">With the Chorus they daily and nightly sang ,—</l>
     <l n="37">“ Far and few , far and few ,</l>
     <l n="38">Are the lands where the Jumblies live ;</l>
     <l n="39">Their heads are green , and their hands are blue ,</l>
     <l n="40">And they went to sea in a sieve . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">Happily , happily passed those days !</l>
     <l n="42">While the cheerful Jumblies staid ;</l>
     <l n="43">They danced in circlets all night long ,</l>
     <l n="44">To the plaintive pipe of the lively Dong ,</l>
     <l n="45">In moonlight , shine , or shade .</l>
     <l n="46">For day and night he was always there</l>
     <l n="47">By the side of the Jumbly Girl so fair ,</l>
     <l n="48">With her sky-blue hands and her sea-green hair ;</l>
     <l n="49">Till the morning came of that hateful day</l>
     <l n="50">When the Jumblies sailed in their sieve away ,</l>
     <l n="51">And the Dong was left on the cruel shore</l>
     <l n="52">Gazing , gazing for evermore ,—</l>
     <l n="53">Ever keeping his weary eyes on</l>
     <l n="54">That pea-green sail on the far horizon ,—</l>
     <l n="55">Singing the Jumbly Chorus still</l>
     <l n="56">As he sate all day on the grassy hill ,—</l>
     <l n="57">“ Far and few , far and few ,</l>
     <l n="58">Are the lands where the Jumblies live ;</l>
     <l n="59">Their heads are green , and their hands are blue ,</l>
     <l n="60">And they went to sea in a sieve . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="61">But when the sun was low in the West ,</l>
     <l n="62">The Dong arose and said ,—</l>
     <l n="63">“ What little sense I once possessed</l>
     <l n="64">Has quite gone out of my head ! ”</l>
     <l n="65">And since that day he wanders still</l>
     <l n="66">By lake and forest , marsh and hill ,</l>
     <l n="67">Singing , “ O somewhere , in valley or plain ,</l>
     <l n="68">Might I find my Jumbly Girl again !</l>
     <l n="69">For ever I 'll seek by lake and shore</l>
     <l n="70">Till I find my Jumbly Girl once more ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="71">Playing a pipe with silvery squeaks ,</l>
     <l n="72">Since then his Jumbly Girl he seeks ;</l>
     <l n="73">And because by night he could not see ,</l>
     <l n="74">He gathered the bark of the Twangum Tree</l>
     <l n="75">On the flowery plain that grows .</l>
     <l n="76">And he wove him a wondrous Nose ,—</l>
     <l n="77">A Nose as strange as a Nose could be !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="78">Of vast proportions and painted red ,</l>
     <l n="79">And tied with cords to the back of his head .</l>
     <l n="80">In a hollow rounded space it ended</l>
     <l n="81">With a luminous Lamp within suspended ,</l>
     <l n="82">All fenced about</l>
     <l n="83">With a bandage stout</l>
     <l n="84">To prevent the wind from blowing it out ;</l>
     <l n="85">And with holes all round to send the light</l>
     <l n="86">In gleaming rays on the dismal night</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="87">And now each night , and all night long ,</l>
     <l n="88">Over those plains still roams the Dong ;</l>
     <l n="89">And above the wail of the Chimp and Snipe</l>
     <l n="90">You may hear the squeak of his plaintive pipe ,</l>
     <l n="91">While ever he seeks , but seeks in vain ,</l>
     <l n="92">To meet with his Jumbly Girl again ;</l>
     <l n="93">Lonely and wild , all night he goes ,—</l>
     <l n="94">The Dong with a luminous Nose !</l>
     <l n="95">And all who watch at the midnight hour ,</l>
     <l n="96">From Hall or Terrace or lofty Tower ,</l>
     <l n="97">Cry , as they trace the Meteor bright ,</l>
     <l n="98">Moving along through the dreary night ,—</l>
     <l n="99">“ This is the hour when forth he goes ,</l>
     <l n="100">The Dong with a luminous Nose !</l>
     <l n="101">Yonder , over the plain he goes ,—</l>
     <l n="102">He goes !</l>
     <l n="103">He goes ,—</l>
     <l n="104">The Dong with a luminous Nose ! ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Two old Bachelors were living in one house ;</l>
     <l n="3">One caught a Muffin , the other caught a Mouse .</l>
     <l n="4">Said he who caught the Muffin to him who caught the Mouse ,—</l>
     <l n="5">“ This happens just in time ! For we 've nothing in the house ,</l>
     <l n="6">Save a tiny slice of lemon and a teaspoonful of honey ,</l>
     <l n="7">And what to do for dinner — since we have n't any money ?</l>
     <l n="8">And what can we expect if we have n't any dinner ,</l>
     <l n="9">But to lose our teeth and eyelashes and keep on growing thinner ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">Said he who caught the Mouse to him who caught the Muffin ,—</l>
     <l n="11">“ We might cook this little Mouse , if we only had some Stuffin ’ !</l>
     <l n="12">If we had but Sage and Onion we could do extremely well ;</l>
     <l n="13">But how to get that Stuffin ’ it is difficult to tell ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="14">Those two old Bachelors ran quickly to the town</l>
     <l n="15">And asked for Sage and Onion as they wandered up and down ;</l>
     <l n="16">They borrowed two large Onions , but no Sage was to be found</l>
     <l n="17">In the Shops , or in the Market , or in all the Gardens round .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="18">But some one said , “ A hill there is , a little to the north ,</l>
     <l n="19">And to its purpledicular top a narrow way leads forth ;</l>
     <l n="20">And there among the rugged rocks abides an ancient Sage ,—</l>
     <l n="21">An earnest Man , who reads all day a most perplexing page .</l>
     <l n="22">Climb up , and seize him by the toes ,— all studious as he sits ,—</l>
     <l n="23">And pull him down , and chop him into endless little bits !</l>
     <l n="24">Then mix him with your Onion ( cut up likewise into Scraps ) ,—</l>
     <l n="25">When your Stuffin ’ will be ready , and very good — perhaps . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="26">Those two old Bachelors without loss of time</l>
     <l n="27">The nearly purpledicular crags at once began to climb ;</l>
     <l n="28">And at the top , among the rocks , all seated in a nook ,</l>
     <l n="29">They saw that Sage a-reading of a most enormous book .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="30">“ You earnest Sage ! ” aloud they cried , “ your book you 've read enough in !</l>
     <l n="31">We wish to chop you into bits to mix you into Stuffin ’ ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="32">But that old Sage looked calmly up , and with his awful book ,</l>
     <l n="33">At those two Bachelors ’ bald heads a certain aim he took ;</l>
     <l n="34">And over Crag and precipice they rolled promiscuous down ,—</l>
     <l n="35">At once they rolled , and never stopped in lane or field or town ;</l>
     <l n="36">And when they reached their house , they found ( besides their want</l>
     <l n="37">of Stuffin ’ ) ,</l>
     <l n="38">The Mouse had fled — and , previously , had eaten up the Muffin .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="39">They left their home in silence by the once convivial door ;</l>
     <l n="40">And from that hour those Bachelors were never heard of more .</l>

     <l n="17">Wing to wing we dance around ,</l>
     <l n="18">Stamping our feet with a flumpy sound ,</l>
     <l n="19">Opening our mouths as Pelicans ought ;</l>
     <l n="20">And this is the song we nightly snort ,—</l>
     <l n="21">Ploffskin , Pluffskin , Pelican jee !</l>

     <l n="25">Last year came out our Daughter Dell ,</l>

     <l n="27">To do her honor a feast we made</l>
     <l n="28">For every bird that can swim or wade ,—</l>

     <l n="33">Thousands of Birds in wondrous flight !</l>
     <l n="34">They ate and drank and danced all night ,</l>

     <l n="41">Yes , they came ; and among the rest</l>
     <l n="42">The King of the Cranes all grandly dressed .</l>
     <l n="43">Such a lovely tail ! Its feathers float</l>
     <l n="44">Between the ends of his blue dress-coat ;</l>
     <l n="45">With pea-green trowsers all so neat ,</l>

     <l n="49">As soon as he saw our Daughter Dell ,</l>
     <l n="50">In violent love that Crane King fell ,—</l>

     <l n="52">With a wreath of shrimps in her short white hair .</l>
     <l n="53">And before the end of the next long day</l>
     <l n="54">Our Dell had given her heart away ;</l>
     <l n="55">For the King of the Cranes had won that heart</l>
     <l n="56">With a Crocodile 's egg and a large fish-tart .</l>
     <l n="57">She vowed to marry the King of the Cranes ,</l>
     <l n="58">Leaving the Nile for stranger plains ;</l>

     <l n="68">And we stood alone in the silent night !</l>
     <l n="69">Often since , in the nights of June ,</l>
