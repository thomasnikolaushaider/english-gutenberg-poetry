   <div type="preface">
    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">The design of the projector of this volume was , that it should contain the Best of the shorter humorous poems in the literatures of England and the United States , except :</p>
    <p n="2">Poems so local or cotemporary in subject or allusion , as not to be readily understood by the modern American reader ;</p>
    <p n="3">Poems which , from the freedom of expression allowed in the healthy ages , can not now be read aloud in a company of men and women ;</p>
    <p n="4">Poems that have become perfectly familiar to every body , from their incessant reproduction in school-books and newspapers ; and</p>
    <p n="5">Poems by living American authors , who have collected their humorous pieces from the periodicals in which most of them originally appeared , and given them to the world in their own names .</p>
    <p n="6">Holmes , Saxe , and Lowell are , therefore , only REPRESENTED in this collection . To have done more than fairly represent them , had been to infringe rights which are doubly sacred , because they are not protected by law . To have done less would have deprived the reader of a most convenient means of observing that , in a kind of composition confessed to be among the most difficult , our native wits are not excelled by foreign .</p>
    <p n="7">The editor expected to be embarrassed with a profusion of material for his purpose . But , on a survey of the poetical literature of the two countries , it was discovered that , of really excellent humorous poetry , of the kinds universally interesting , untainted by obscenity , not marred by coarseness of language , nor obscured by remote allusion , the quantity in existence is not great . It is thought that this volume contains a very large proportion of the best pieces that haveappeared .</p>
    <p n="8">An unexpected feature of the book is , that there is not a line in it by a female hand . The alleged foibles of the Fair have given occasion to libraries of comic verse ; yet , with diligent search , no humorous poems by women have been found which are of merit sufficient to give them claim to a place in a collection like this . That lively wit and graceful gayety , that quick perception of the absurd , which ladies are continually displaying in their conversation and correspondence , never , it seems , suggest the successful epigram , or inspire happy satirical verse .</p>
    <p n="9">The reader will not be annoyed by an impertinent superfluity of notes . At the end of the volume may be found a list of the sources from which its contents have been taken . For the convenience of those who live remote from biographical dictionaries , a few dates and other particulars have been added to the mention of each name . For valuable contributions to this portion of the volume , and for much well-directed work upon other parts of it , the reader is indebted to Mr. T. BUTLER GUNN , of this city .</p>
    <p n="10">There is , certainly , nothing more delightful than the fun of a man of genius . Humor , as Mr. Thackeray observes , is charming , and poetry is charming , but the blending of the two in the same composition is irresistible . There is much nonsense in this book , and some folly , and a little ill-nature ; but there is more wisdom than either . They who possess it may congratulate themselves upon having the largest collection ever made of the sportive effusions of genius .</p>

       <l n="6">Were perfect in our kind !.. And why despise</l>
       <l n="7">The sow-born grunter ?.. He is obstinate ,</l>
       <l n="8">Thou answerest ; ugly , and the filthiest beast</l>
       <l n="9">That banquets upon offal . ... Now I pray you</l>
       <l n="10">Hear the pig 's counsel .</l>
       <l n="11">Is he obstinate ?</l>
       <l n="12">We must not , Jacob , be deceived by words ;</l>

       <l n="14">Receive base money at the current worth</l>
       <l n="15">But with a just suspicion try their sound ,</l>
       <l n="16">And in the even balance weigh them well</l>

       <l n="20">Their profit , and not his . He hath not learned</l>
       <l n="21">That pigs were made for man ,... born to be brawn 'd</l>
       <l n="22">And baconized : that he must please to give</l>
       <l n="23">Just what his gracious masters please to take ;</l>
       <l n="24">Perhaps his tusks , the weapons Nature gave</l>
       <l n="25">For self-defense , the general privilege ;</l>
       <l n="26">Perhaps ,... hark , Jacob ! dost thou hear that horn ?</l>

       <l n="28">Their enemy is at hand .</l>

       <l n="31">Those eyes have taught the lover flattery .</l>
       <l n="32">His face , ... nay , Jacob ! Jacob ! were it fair</l>
       <l n="33">To judge a lady in her dishabille ?</l>
       <l n="34">Fancy it dressed , and with saltpeter rouged .</l>
       <l n="35">Behold his tail , my friend ; with curls like that</l>
       <l n="36">The wanton hop marries her stately spouse :</l>
       <l n="37">So crisp in beauty Amoretta 's hair</l>
       <l n="38">Rings round her lover 's soul the chains of love .</l>
       <l n="39">And what is beauty , but the aptitude</l>

       <l n="41">And thou wilt find that no imagined change</l>
       <l n="42">Can beautify this beast . Place at his end</l>
       <l n="43">The starry glories of the peacock 's pride ,</l>
       <l n="44">Give him the swan 's white breast ; for his horn-hoofs</l>
       <l n="45">Shape such a foot and ankle as the waves</l>

       <l n="51">The last charge ,... he lives</l>

       <l n="58">The pig is a philosopher , who knows</l>
       <l n="59">No prejudice . Dirt ?... Jacob , what is dirt ?</l>
       <l n="60">If matter ,... why the delicate dish that tempts</l>
       <l n="61">An o'ergorged epicure to the last morsel</l>

       <l n="38">While rising stock [ Footnote : South Sea , 1720 . ] her conscience pricks ;</l>

      <head>MORAL .</head>
      <head>This tale has a moral . Ye youths , oh , beware Of liquor , and how you run after the fair ! Shun playing at SHORTS — avoid quarrels and jars — And do n't take to smoking those nasty cigars ! — Let no run of bad-luck , or despair for some Jewess-eyed Damsel , induce you to contemplate suicide ! Do n't sit up much later than ten or eleven !— Be up in the morning by half after seven ! Keep from flirting — nor risk , warn 'd by Rupert 's miscarriage , An action for breach of a promise of marriage ;— Do n't fancy odd fishes ! Do n't prig silver dishes ! And to sum up the whole , in the shortest phrase I know , BEWARE OF THE RHINE , AND TAKE CARE OF THE RHINO !</head>

     <p>Clouds keep the stoutest mortals under , When , bellowing *, they discharge their thunder : *[ Footnote : This word is not here to be understood of a bull , but a cloud , which makes a noise like a bull , when it thunders . ] So , when the alarum-bell is rung , Of Xanti 's * everlasting tongue , [ Footnote : Xanti , a nick-name of Xantippe , that scold of glorious memory , who never let poor Socrates have one moment 's peace of mind ; yet with unexampled patience he bore her pestilential tongue . I shall beg the ladies ’ pardon if I insert a few passages concerning her : and at the same time I assure them it is not to lesson those of the present age , who are possessed of the like laudable talents ; for I will confess , that I know three in the city of Dublin , no way inferior to Xantippe , but that they have not as great men to work upon .</p>
     <p>When a friend asked Socrates how he could bear the scolding of his wife Xantippe , he retorted , and asked him how he could bear the gaggling of his geese Ay but my geese lay eggs for me , replies his friend ; So does my wife bear children , said Socrates .— Diog , Laert ,</p>
     <p>Being asked at another time , by a friend , how he could bear her tongue , he said , she was of this use to him , that she taught him to bear the impertinences of others with more ease when he went abroad ,— Plat , de Capiend . ex . host . utilit .</p>
     <p>Socrates invited his friend Euthymedus to supper . Xantippe , in great rage , went into them , and overset the table . Huthymedus , rising in a passion to go off , My dear friend , stay , said Socrates , did not a hen do the same thing at your house the other day , and did I show any resentment ?— Plat , de ira cohibenda .</p>
     <p>I could give many more instances of her termagancy and his philosophy , if such a proceeding might not look as if I were glad of an opportunity to expose the fair sex ; but , to show that I have no such design , I declare solemnly , that I had much worse stories to tell of her behaviour to her husband , which I rather passed over , on account of the great esteem which I bear the ladies , especially those in the honorable station of matrimony . ]</p>

     <p>HOLY WILLIE 'S PRAYER . [ Footnote : Kennedy gives the following account of the origin of “ Holy Willie 's Prayer ; ” — Gavin Hamilton , Esq ., Clerk of Ayr , the Poet 's friend and benefactor was accosted one Sunday morning by a mendicant , who begged alms of him . Not recollecting that it was the Sabbath , Hamilton set the man to work in his garden , which lay on lay on the public road , and the poor fellow was discovered by the people on their way to the kirk , and they immediately stoned him from the ground . For this offense , Mr. Hamilton was not permitted to have a child christened , which his wife bore him soon afterward , until he applied to the synod . His most officious opponent was William Fisher , one of the elders of the church : and to revenge the insult to his friend , Burns made him the subject of this humorous ballad . ] ROBERT BURNS .</p>

      <head>LETTERS FROM MISS BIDDY FUDGE AT PARIS TO MISS DOROTHY — IN IRELAND THOMAS MOORE .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">What a time since I wrote !— I 'm a sad naughty girl —</l>
       <l n="2">Though , like a tee-totum , I 'm all in a twirl ,</l>
       <l n="3">Yet even ( as you wittily say ) a tee-totum</l>
       <l n="4">Between all its twirls gives a LETTER to note ‘ em .</l>
       <l n="5">But , Lord , such a place ! and then , Dolly , my dresses ,</l>
       <l n="6">My gowns , so divine !— there 's no language expresses ,</l>
       <l n="7">Except just the TWO words “ superbe , ” “ magmfique , ”</l>
       <l n="8">The trimmings of that which I had home last week !</l>
       <l n="9">It is call 'd — I forget — a la — something which sounded</l>
       <l n="10">Like alicampane — but , in truth , I 'm confounded</l>
       <l n="11">And bother 'd , my dear , ‘ twixt that troublesome boy 's</l>
       <l n="12">( Bob 's ) cookery language , and Madame Le Roi 's :</l>
       <l n="13">What with fillets of roses , and fillets of veal ,</l>
       <l n="14">Things garni with lace , and things garni with eel ,</l>
       <l n="15">One 's hair , and one 's cutlets both en papillote ,</l>
       <l n="16">And a thousand more things I shall ne'er have by rote ,</l>
       <l n="17">I can scarce tell the difference , at least as to phrase ,</l>
       <l n="18">Between beef a la Psyche and curls a la braise .—</l>
       <l n="19">But , in short , dear , I 'm trick 'd out quite a la Francaise ,</l>
       <l n="20">With my bonnet — so beautiful !— high up and poking ,</l>
       <l n="21">Like things that are put to keep chimneys from smoking .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="22">Where SHALL I begin with the endless delights</l>
       <l n="23">Of this Eden of milliners , monkeys , and sights —</l>
       <l n="24">This dear busy place , where there 's nothing transacting ,</l>
       <l n="25">But dressing and dinnering , dancing and acting ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="26">Imprimis , the Opera — mercy , my ears !</l>
       <l n="27">Brother Bobby 's remark t'other night was a true one</l>
       <l n="28">“ This MUST be the music , ” said he , “ of the SPEARS ,</l>
       <l n="29">For I 'm curst if each note of it does n't run through one ! ”</l>
       <l n="30">Pa says ( and you know , love , his book 's to make out ) ,</l>
       <l n="31">‘ T was the Jacobins brought every mischief about ;</l>
       <l n="32">That this passion for roaring has come in of late ,</l>
       <l n="33">Since the rabble all tried for a VOICE in the State .</l>
       <l n="34">What a frightful idea , one 's mind to o'erwhelm !</l>
       <l n="35">What a chorus , dear Dolly , would soon be let loose of it !</l>
       <l n="36">If , when of age , every man in the realm</l>
       <l n="37">Had a voice like old Lais , and chose to make use of it !</l>
       <l n="38">No — never was known in this riotous sphere</l>
       <l n="39">Such a breach of the peace as their singing , my dear ;</l>
       <l n="40">So bad , too , you 'd swear that the god of both arts ,</l>
       <l n="41">Of Music and Physic , had taken a frolic</l>
       <l n="42">For setting a loud fit of asthma in parts ,</l>
       <l n="43">And composing a fine rumbling base to a cholic !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="44">But , the dancing — ah parlez moi , Dolly , des ca —</l>
       <l n="45">There , indeed , is a treat that charms all but Papa .</l>
       <l n="46">Such beauty — such grace — oh ye sylphs of romance !</l>
       <l n="47">Fly , fly to Titania , and ask her if SHE has</l>
       <l n="48">One light-footed nymph in her train , that can dance</l>
       <l n="49">Like divine Bigottini and sweet Fanny Bias !</l>
       <l n="50">Fanny Bias in Flora — dear creature !— you 'd swear ,</l>
       <l n="51">When her delicate feet in the dance twinkle round ,</l>
       <l n="52">That her steps are of light , that her home is the air ,</l>
       <l n="53">And she only par complaisance touches the ground .</l>
       <l n="54">And when Bigottini in Psyche dishevels</l>
       <l n="55">Her black flowing hair , and by demons is driven ,</l>
       <l n="56">Oh ! who does not envy those rude little devils ,</l>
       <l n="57">That hold her , and hug her , and keep her from heaven ?</l>
       <l n="58">Then , the music — so softly its cadences die ,</l>
       <l n="59">So divinely — oh , Dolly ! between you and I ,</l>
       <l n="60">It 's as well for my peace that there 's nobody nigh</l>
       <l n="61">To make love to me then — YOU 'VE a soul , and can judge</l>
       <l n="62">What a crisis ‘ t would be for your friend Biddy Fudge !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="63">The next place ( which Bobby has near lost his heart in ) ,</l>
       <l n="64">They call it the Play-house — I think — of Saint Martin :</l>
       <l n="65">Quite charming — and VERY religious — what folly</l>
       <l n="66">To say that the French are not pious , dear Dolly ,</l>
       <l n="67">When here one beholds , so correctly and rightly ,</l>
       <l n="68">The Testament turn 'd into melo-drames nightly</l>
       <l n="69">And , doubtless , so fond they 're of scriptural facts ,</l>
       <l n="70">They will soon get the Pentateuch up in five acts .</l>
       <l n="71">Here Daniel , in pantomime , bids bold defiance</l>
       <l n="72">To Nebuchadnezzar and all his stuff 'd lions ,</l>
       <l n="73">While pretty young Israelites dance round the Prophet ,</l>
       <l n="74">In very thin clothing , and BUT little of it ;—</l>
       <l n="75">Here Begrand , who shines in this scriptural path ,</l>
       <l n="76">As the lovely Susanna , without even a relic</l>
       <l n="77">Of drapery round her , comes out of the Bath</l>
       <l n="78">In a manner , that , Bob says , is quite EVE-ANGELIC !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="79">But , in short , dear , ‘ t would take me a month to recite</l>
       <l n="80">All the exquisite places we 're at , day and night ;</l>
       <l n="81">And , besides , ere I finish , I think you 'll be glad</l>
       <l n="82">Just to hear one delightful adventure I 've had .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="83">Last night , at the Beaujon , a place where — I doubt</l>
       <l n="84">If I well can describe — there are cars that set out</l>
       <l n="85">From a lighted pavilion , high up in the air ,</l>
       <l n="86">And rattle you down , Doll — you hardly know where .</l>
       <l n="87">These vehicles , mind me , in which you go through</l>
       <l n="88">This delightfully dangerous journey , hold TWO .</l>
       <l n="89">Some cavalier asks , with humility , whether</l>
       <l n="90">You 'll venture down with him — you smile — ‘ tis a match ;</l>
       <l n="91">In an instant you 're seated , and down both together</l>
       <l n="92">Go thundering , as if you went post to old Scratch ;</l>
       <l n="93">Well , it was but last night , as I stood and remark 'd</l>
       <l n="94">On the looks and odd ways of the girls who embark 'd ,</l>
       <l n="95">The impatience of some for the perilous flight ,</l>
       <l n="96">The forc 'd giggle of others , ‘ twixt pleasure and fright ,</l>
       <l n="97">That there came up — imagine , dear Doll , if you can —</l>
       <l n="98">A fine sallow , sublime , sort of Werter-fac 'd man ,</l>
       <l n="99">With mustaches that gave ( what we read of so oft ) ,</l>
       <l n="100">The dear Corsair expression , half savage , half soft</l>
       <l n="101">As Hyienas in love may be fancied to look , or</l>
       <l n="102">A something between Abelard and old Bincher !</l>
       <l n="103">Up he came , Doll , to me , and uncovering his head</l>
       <l n="104">( Rather bald , but so warlike ! ) in bad English said ,</l>
       <l n="105">“ Ah ! my dear — if Ma'maelle vil be so very good —</l>
       <l n="106">Just for von little course ” — though I scarce understood</l>
       <l n="107">What he wish 'd me to do , I said , thank him , I would .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="108">Off we set — and , though ‘ faith , dear , I hardly knew whether</l>
       <l n="109">My head or my heels were the uppermost then ,</l>
       <l n="110">For ‘ t was like heaven and earth , Dolly , coming together —</l>
       <l n="111">Yet , spite of the danger , we dared it again .</l>
       <l n="112">And oh ! as I gazed on the features and air</l>
       <l n="113">Of the man , who for me all this peril defied ,</l>
       <l n="114">I could fancy almost he and I were a pair</l>
       <l n="115">Of unhappy young lovers , who thus , side by side ,</l>
       <l n="116">Were taking , instead of rope , pistol , or dagger , a</l>
       <l n="117">Desperate dash down the falls of Niagara !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="118">This achiev 'd , through the gardens we saunter 'd about ,</l>
       <l n="119">Saw the fire-works , exclaim 'd “ magnifique ! ” at each cracker</l>
       <l n="120">And , when ‘ t was all o'er , the dear man saw us out</l>
       <l n="121">With the air , I WILL say , of a prince , to our fiacre .</l>
       <l n="122">Now , hear me — this stranger — it may be mere folly —</l>
       <l n="123">But WHO do you think we all think it is , Dolly ?</l>
       <l n="124">Why , bless you , no less than the great King of Prussia ,</l>
       <l n="125">Who 's here now incog .— he , who made such a fuss , you</l>
       <l n="126">Remember , in London , with Blucher and Platoff ,</l>
       <l n="127">When Sal was near kissing old Blucher 's cravat off !</l>
       <l n="128">Pa says he 's come here to look after his money</l>
       <l n="129">( Not taking things now as he used under Boney ) ,</l>
       <l n="130">Which suits with our friend , for Bob saw him , he swore ,</l>
       <l n="131">Looking sharp to the silver received at the door .</l>
       <l n="132">Besides , too , they say that his grief for his Queen</l>
       <l n="133">( Which was plain in this sweet fellow 's face to be seen )</l>
       <l n="134">Requires such a stimulant dose as this car is ,</l>
       <l n="135">Used three times a day with young ladies in Paris .</l>
       <l n="136">Some Doctor , indeed , has declared that such grief</l>
       <l n="137">Should — unless ‘ t would to utter despairing its folly push —</l>
       <l n="138">Fly to the Beaujon , and there seek relief</l>
       <l n="139">By rattling , as Bob says , “ like shot through a holly-bush . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="140">I must now bid adieu — only think , Dolly , think</l>
       <l n="141">If this SHOULD be the King — I have scarce slept a wink</l>
       <l n="142">With imagining how it will sound in the papers ,</l>
       <l n="143">And how all the Misses my good luck will grudge ,</l>
       <l n="144">When they read that Count Buppin , to drive away vapors ,</l>
       <l n="145">Has gone down the Beaujon with Miss Biddy Fudge .</l>

       <l n="148">In the way he went poising , and managed to tower</l>

       <l n="1">Well , it ISN'T the King , after all , my dear creature !</l>
       <l n="2">But DON'T you go laugh , now — there 's nothing to quiz in ‘ t —</l>
       <l n="3">For grandeur of air and for grimness of feature ,</l>
       <l n="4">He MIGHT be a King , Doll , though , hang him , he is n't .</l>
       <l n="5">At first I felt hurt , for I wish 'd it , I own ,</l>

       <l n="13">Whose charms may their price in an HONEST way fetch ,</l>
       <l n="14">That a Brandenburg — ( what IS a Brandenburg , DOLLY ? ) —</l>
       <l n="15">Would be , after all , no such very great catch ,</l>
       <l n="16">If the R — G — T , indeed — ” added he , looking sly —</l>
       <l n="17">( You remember that comical squint of his eye )</l>
       <l n="18">But I stopp 'd him — “ La , Pa , how CAN you say so ,</l>
       <l n="19">When the R — G — T loves none but old women , you know ! ”</l>
       <l n="20">Which is fact , my dear Dolly — we , girls of eighteen ,</l>

       <l n="22">And would like us much better as old — ay , as old</l>
       <l n="23">As that Countess of Desmond , of whom I 've been told</l>
       <l n="24">That she lived to much more than a hundred and ten ,</l>
       <l n="25">And was kill 'd by a fall from a cherry-tree then !</l>
       <l n="26">What a frisky old girl ! but — to come to my lover ,</l>

       <l n="31">From that evening I date the first dawn of my bliss ;</l>
       <l n="32">When we both rattled off in that dear little carriage ,</l>
       <l n="33">Whose journey , Bob says , is so like love and marriage ,</l>
       <l n="34">“ Beginning gay , desperate , clashing down-hilly ;</l>
       <l n="35">And ending as dull as a six-inside Dilly ! ”</l>
       <l n="36">Well , scarcely a wink did I sleep the night through ,</l>
       <l n="37">And , next day , having scribbled my letter to you ,</l>
       <l n="38">With a heart full of hope this sweet fellow to meet ,</l>
       <l n="39">Set out with Papa , to see Louis Dix-huit</l>
       <l n="40">Make his bow to some half-dozen women and boys ,</l>
       <l n="41">Who get up a small concert of shrill Vive le Rois —</l>
       <l n="42">And how vastly genteeler , my clear , even this is ,</l>
       <l n="43">Than vulgar Pall-Mall 's oratorio of hisses !</l>
       <l n="44">The gardens seem 'd full — so , of course , we walk 'd o'er ‘ em ,</l>

       <l n="46">And Daphnes , and vases , and many a statue</l>
       <l n="47">There staring , with not even a stitch on them , at you !</l>
       <l n="48">The ponds , too , we view 'd — stood awhile on the brink</l>
       <l n="49">To contemplate the play of those pretty gold fishes —</l>
       <l n="50">“ LIVE BULLION ” says merciless Bob , “ which I think ,</l>

       <l n="53">Or gold fishes , to her that 's in search of her love ?</l>
       <l n="54">In vain did I wildly explore every chair</l>
       <l n="55">Where a thing LIKE a man was — no lover sat there !</l>
       <l n="56">In vain my fond eyes did I eagerly cast</l>
       <l n="57">At the whiskers , mustaches , and wigs that went past ,</l>
       <l n="58">To obtain , if I could , but a glance at that curl ,</l>
       <l n="59">But a glimpse of those whiskers , as sacred , my girl ,</l>
       <l n="60">As the lock that , Pa says , is to Mussulmen given ,</l>
       <l n="61">For the angel to hold by that “ lugs them to heaven ! ”</l>
       <l n="62">Alas , there went by me full many a quiz ,</l>

       <l n="64">Disappointed , I found myself sighing out “ well-a-day , ”</l>
       <l n="65">Thought of the words of T-H M-RE 'S Irish melody ,</l>
       <l n="66">Something about the “ green spot of delight , ”</l>
       <l n="67">( Which you know , Captain Macintosh sung to us one day )</l>
       <l n="68">Ah , Dolly ! MY “ spot ” was that Saturday night ,</l>

       <l n="99">( For I knew his white small-clothes and brown leather gaiters ) ,</l>
       <l n="100">A group of fair statues from Greece smiling o'er him ,</l>
       <l n="101">And lots of red currant-juice sparkling before him !</l>
       <l n="102">Oh Dolly , these heroes — what creatures they are !</l>
       <l n="103">In the boudoir the same as in fields full of slaughter ;</l>
       <l n="104">As cool in the Beaujon 's precipitous car</l>
       <l n="105">As when safe at Tortoni 's , o'er iced currant-water !</l>
       <l n="106">He joined us — imagine , dear creature my ecstasy —</l>
       <l n="107">Join 'd by the man I 'd have broken ten necks to see !</l>
       <l n="108">Bob wish 'd to treat him with punch a la glace ,</l>
       <l n="109">But the sweet fellow swore that my beaute , my GRACE ,</l>
       <l n="110">And my je-ne-sais-quoi ( then his whiskers he twirl 'd )</l>

       <l n="113">Both his French and his English are Greek , Doll , to me .</l>
       <l n="114">But , in short , I felt happy as ever fond heart did :</l>
       <l n="115">And , happier still , when ‘ t was fix 'd , ere we parted ,</l>
       <l n="116">That , if the next day should be PASTORAL weather ,</l>
       <l n="117">We all would set off in French buggies , together ,</l>
       <l n="118">To see Montmorency — that place which , you know ,</l>
       <l n="119">Is so famous for cherries and Jean Jacques Rousseau .</l>
       <l n="120">His card then he gave us — the NAME , rather creased —</l>
       <l n="121">But ‘ t was Calicot — something — a colonel , at least !</l>
       <l n="122">After which — sure there never was hero so civil — he</l>
       <l n="123">Saw us safe home to our door in Rue Rivoli ,</l>
       <l n="124">Where his LAST words , as at parting , he threw</l>
       <l n="125">A soft look o'er his shoulders , were — “ how do you do ? ”</l>

       <l n="20">Had we order 'd it dear , of the best poet going ,</l>
       <l n="21">It scarce could be furnish 'd more golden and glowing .</l>

       <l n="24">On the grass an odd dew-drop was glittering yet ,</l>
       <l n="25">Like my aunt 's diamond pin on her green tabinet !</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Careful , observers may foretell the hour ,</l>
       <l n="2">( By sure prognostics ) , when to dread a shower .</l>
       <l n="3">While rain depends , the pensive cat gives o'er</l>
       <l n="4">Her frolics , and pursues her tail no more .</l>
       <l n="5">Returning home at night , you 'll find the sink</l>
       <l n="6">Strike your offended sense with double stink .</l>
       <l n="7">If you be wise , then , go not far to dine :</l>
       <l n="8">You 'll spend in coach-hire more than save in wine</l>
       <l n="9">A coming shower your shooting corns presage ,</l>
       <l n="10">Old aches will throb , your hollow tooth will rage ;</l>
       <l n="11">Sauntering in coffee-house is Dulman seen ;</l>
       <l n="12">He damns the climate , and complains of spleen .</l>
       <l n="13">Meanwhile the South , rising with dabbled wings ,</l>
       <l n="14">A sable cloud athwart the welkin flings ,</l>
       <l n="15">That swill 'd more liquor than it could contain ,</l>
       <l n="16">And , like a drunkard , gives it up again .</l>
       <l n="17">Brisk Susan whips her linen from the rope ,</l>
       <l n="18">While the first drizzling shower is borne aslope ;</l>
       <l n="19">Such is that sprinkling which some careless quear .</l>
       <l n="20">Flirts on you from her mop , but not so clean :</l>
       <l n="21">You fly , invoke the gods ; then , turning , stop</l>
       <l n="22">To rail ; she singing , still whirls on her mop .</l>
       <l n="23">Not yet the dust had shunn 'd the unequal strife ,</l>
       <l n="24">But , aided by the wind , fought still for life ,</l>
       <l n="25">And wafted with its foe by violent gust ,</l>
       <l n="26">‘ T was doubtful which was rain , and which was dust .</l>
       <l n="27">Ah ! where must needy poet seek for aid ,</l>
       <l n="28">When dust and rain at once his coat invade ?</l>
       <l n="29">Sole coat ! where dust , cemented by the rain ,</l>
       <l n="30">Erects the nap , and leaves a cloudy stain !</l>
       <l n="31">Now in contiguous drops the flood comes down ,</l>
       <l n="32">Threatening with deluge this DEVOTED town .</l>
       <l n="33">To shops in crowds the daggled females fly ,</l>
       <l n="34">Pretend to cheapen goods , but nothing buy .</l>
       <l n="35">The Templar spruce , while every spout 's abroach .</l>
       <l n="36">Stays till ‘ tis fair , yet seems to call a coach .</l>
       <l n="37">The tuck 'd up sempstress walks with hasty strides ,</l>
       <l n="38">While streams run down her oil 'd umbrella 's sides .</l>
       <l n="39">Here various kinds , by various fortunes led ,</l>
       <l n="40">Commence acquaintance underneath a shed .</l>
       <l n="41">Triumphant Tories , and desponding Whigs ,</l>
       <l n="42">Forget their feuds , and join to save their wigs .</l>
       <l n="43">Box 'd in a chair the beau impatient sits ,</l>
       <l n="44">While spouts run clattering o'er the roof by fits ,</l>
       <l n="45">And ever and anon with frightful din</l>
       <l n="46">The leather sounds ; he trembles from within .</l>
       <l n="47">So when Troy chairmen bore the wooden steed ,</l>
       <l n="48">Pregnant with Greeks impatient to be freed ,</l>
       <l n="49">( Those bully Greeks , who , as the moderns do ,</l>
       <l n="50">Instead of paying chairmen , ran them through ) ,</l>
       <l n="51">Laocoon struck the outside with his spear ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="53">Now from all parts the swelling kennels flow ,</l>
       <l n="54">And bear their trophies with them as they go :</l>
       <l n="55">Filth of all hues and odor , seem to tell</l>
       <l n="56">What street they sail 'd from by their sight and smell .</l>
       <l n="57">They , as each torrent drives with rapid force ,</l>
       <l n="58">From Smithfield to St. Pulchre 's shape their course ,</l>
       <l n="59">And in huge confluence join 'd at Snowhill ridge ,</l>
       <l n="60">Fall from the conduit prone to Holborne bridge .</l>
       <l n="61">Sweeping from butchers ’ stalls , dung , guts , and blood ;</l>
       <l n="62">Drown 'd puppies , stinking sprats , all drench 'd in mud ,</l>
       <l n="63">Dead cats , and turnip-tops , come tumbling down the flood .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="81">Reader , my Ode should have a simile —</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="17">
       <l n="93">Some draymen forced themselves ( a pretty luncheon )</l>

       <l n="127">Placed side by side , to reach along to Kew :</l>

     <p>FOR THE DOOR OF THE CELL IN NEWGATE , WHERE MRS. BROWNRIGG , THE ‘ PRENTICE-CIDE WAS CONFINED PREVIOUS TO HER EXECUTION . * FROM THE ANTI-JACOBIN . 1797</p>
     <p>For one long term , or e'er her trial came , Here BROWNRIGG linger 'd . Often have these cells Echoed her blasphemies , as with shrill voice She screamed for fresh Geneva . Not to her Did the blithe fields of Tothill , or thy street , St. Giles , its fair varieties expand ; Till at the last , in slow-drawn cart she went To execution . Dost thou ask her crime ? SHE WHIPP 'D TWO FEMALE ‘ PRENTICES TO DEATH , AND HID THEM IN THE COAL-HOLE . For her mind Shaped strictest plans of discipline . Sage schemes ! Such as Lycurgus taught , when at the shrine Of the Orthyan goddess he bade flog The little Spartans ; such as erst chastised Our Milton , when at college . For this act Did Brownrigg swing . Harsh laws ! But time shall come When France shall reign , and laws be all repeal 'd !</p>

     <p>SONG [ Footnote : There is a curious circumstance connected with the composition of this song , the first five stanzas of which were written by Mr. Canning . Having been accidentally seen , previous to its publication , by Mr. Pitt , who was cognizant of the proceedings of the “ Anti-Jacobin ” writers , he was so amused with it that he took up a pen and composed the last stanza on the spot . ]</p>

And when the weary SOL AROUND HIS BED CLOSES THE SABLE CURTAINS OF THE NIGHT , SUN OF MY SLUMBERS , on my dazzled sight She shines confest .

     <p>A TALE OF DRURY LANE [ Footnote : “ From the parody of Sir Walter Scott we know not what to select — It Is all good . The effect of the fire on the town , and the description of a fireman in his official apparel , may be quoted as amusing specimens of the MISAPPLICATION of the style and meter of Mr. Scott 's admirable romances . ” — Quarterly Review . “ ‘ A Tale of Drury . ’ by Walter Scott , is , upon the whole , admirably execuated ; though the introduction is rather tame . The burning is described with the mighty minstrel 's characteristic love of localitics . The catastrophe is described with a spirit not unworthy of the name so ventureously assumed by the describer ” — Edinburg Review . ]</p>

       <l n="1">And do you ask me , “ What is LIFE ? ”</l>
       <l n="2">And do you ask me , “ What is pleasure ? ”</l>
       <l n="3">My muse and I are not at strife ,</l>
       <l n="4">So listen , lady , to my measure :—</l>
       <l n="5">Listen amid thy graceful leisure ,</l>
       <l n="6">To what is LIFE , and what IS pleasure .</l>
       <l n="7">‘ Tis LIFE to see the first dawn stain</l>
       <l n="8">With sallow light the window-pane :</l>
       <l n="9">To dress — to wear a rough drab coat ,</l>
       <l n="10">With large pearl buttons all afloat</l>
       <l n="11">Upon the waves of plush : to tie</l>
       <l n="12">A kerchief of the King-cup dye</l>
       <l n="13">( White spotted with a small bird'shYpppHeNeye )</l>
       <l n="14">Around the neck , and from the nape</l>
       <l n="15">Let fall an easy fan-like cape :</l>
       <l n="16">To quit the house at morning 's prime ,</l>
       <l n="17">At six or so — about the time</l>
       <l n="18">When watchmen , conscious of the day</l>
       <l n="19">Puff out their lantern 's rush-light ray ;</l>
       <l n="20">Just when the silent streets are strewn</l>
       <l n="21">With level shadows , and the moon</l>
       <l n="22">Takes the day 's wink and walks aside</l>
       <l n="23">To nurse a nap till eventide .</l>
       <l n="24">‘ Tis LIFE to reach the livery stable ,</l>
       <l n="25">Secure the RIBBONS and the DAY-BILL ,</l>
       <l n="26">And mount a gig that had a spring</l>
       <l n="27">Some summer 's back : and then take wing</l>
       <l n="28">Behind ( in Mr. Hamlet 's tongue )</l>
       <l n="29">A jade whose “ withers are unwrung ; ”</l>
       <l n="30">Who stands erect , and yet forlorn ,</l>
       <l n="31">And from a HALF-PAY life of corn ,</l>
       <l n="32">Showing as many POINTS each way</l>
       <l n="33">As Martial 's Epigrammata ,</l>
       <l n="34">Yet who , when set a-going , goes</l>
       <l n="35">Like one undestined to repose .</l>
       <l n="36">‘ Tis LIFE to revel down the road ,</l>
       <l n="37">And QUEER each o'erfraught chaise 's load ,</l>
       <l n="38">To rave and rattle at the GATE ,</l>
       <l n="39">And shower upon the gatherer 's pate</l>
       <l n="40">Damns by the dozens , and such speeches</l>
       <l n="41">As well betokens one 's SLANG riches :</l>
       <l n="42">To take of Deady 's bright STARK NAKED</l>
       <l n="43">A glass or so — ‘ tis LIFE to take it !</l>
       <l n="44">To see the Hurst with tents encampt on ;</l>
       <l n="45">Lurk around Lawrence 's at Hampton ;</l>
       <l n="46">Join the FLASH crowd ( the horse being led</l>
       <l n="47">Into the yard , and clean 'd and fed ) ;</l>
       <l n="48">Talk to Dav ’ Hudson , and Cy ’ Davis</l>
       <l n="49">( The last a fighting rara avis ) ,</l>
       <l n="50">And , half in secret , scheme a plan</l>
       <l n="51">For trying the hardy GAS-LIGHT-MAN .</l>
       <l n="52">‘ Tis LIFE to cross the laden ferry ,</l>
       <l n="53">With boon companions , wild and merry ,</l>
       <l n="54">And see the ring upon the Hurst</l>
       <l n="55">With carts encircled — hear the burst</l>
       <l n="56">At distance of the eager crowd .</l>
       <l n="57">Oh , it is LIFE ! to see a proud</l>
       <l n="58">And dauntless man step , full of hopes ,</l>
       <l n="59">Up to the P. C. stakes and ropes ,</l>
       <l n="60">Throw in his hat , and with a spring ,</l>
       <l n="61">Get gallantly within the ring ;</l>
       <l n="62">Eye the wide crowd , and walk awhile ,</l>
       <l n="63">Taking all cheerings with a smile :</l>
       <l n="64">To see him skip — his well-trained form ,</l>
       <l n="65">White , glowing , muscular , and warm ,</l>
       <l n="66">All beautiful in conscious power ,</l>
       <l n="67">Relaxed and quiet , till the hour ;</l>
       <l n="68">His glossy and transparent frame ,</l>
       <l n="69">In radiant plight to strive for fame !</l>
       <l n="70">To look upon the clean shap 'd limb</l>
       <l n="71">In silk and flannel clothed trim ;</l>
       <l n="72">While round the waist the ‘ kerchief tied ,</l>
       <l n="73">Makes the flesh glow in richer pride .</l>
       <l n="74">‘ Tis more than LIFE , to watch him hold</l>
       <l n="75">His hand forth , tremulous yet bold ,</l>
       <l n="76">Over his second 's , and to clasp</l>
       <l n="77">His rival 's in a quiet grasp ;</l>
       <l n="78">To watch the noble attitude</l>
       <l n="79">He takes — the crowd in breathless mood :</l>
       <l n="80">And then to see , with adamant start ,</l>
       <l n="81">The muscles set , and the great heart</l>
       <l n="82">Hurl a courageous splendid light</l>

     <p>ODE TO PERRY , THE INVENTOR OF THE STEEL PEN . THOMAS HOOD</p>
     <p>“ In this good work , Penn appears the greatest , usefullest of God 's instruments . Firm and unbending when the exigency requires it — soft and yielding when rigid inflexibility is not a desideratum — fluent and flowing , at need , for eloquent rapidity — slow and retentive in cases of deliberation — never spluttering or by amplification going wide of the mark — never splitting , if it can be helped , with any one , but ready to wear itself out rather in their service — all things as it were with all men — ready to embrace the hand of Jew , Christian , or Mohammedan — heavy with the German , light with the Italian , oblique with the English , upright with the Roman , backward in coming forward with the Hebrew — in short , for flexibility , amiability , constitutional durability , general ability , and universal utility , It would be hard to find a parallel to the great Penn . ” — Perry 's CHARACTERISATION OF A SETTLER .</p>

     <note>Just at present no lyrics have so eclatant a succes de societe as the charming companion ballads which , under the above pathetic titles , have made a fureur in the fashionable circles to which the fair composer , to whom they are attributed in the causeries of May Fair and Belgravia ( The HON . MRS. N — T — N ) , belongs . The touching event to which they refer , is the romantic union of the HON . MISS BL — CHE DE F — TZ — FL — M to C — PT — N DE B — RS , of the C-DS — M G — DS , which took the beau monde by surprise last season . Previous to the eclaircissement , the gifted and lovely composer , at a ball given by the distinguished D — CH — SS of S — TH — D , accidentally overheard the searching question of the gallant but penniless Captain , and the passionate and self - devoted answer of his lovely and universally admired fiancee . She instantly rushed home and produced these pathetic and powerful ballads .</note>

Thy willing thrall ? “ NOW AND THEN ; ” But not just at this moment , If you please , Spirit ! No , let me read and ponder on THE PLEADINGS . Declaration ! Plea !! Replication !!! Rejoinder !!!! Surrejoinder !!!!! Rebutter !!!!!! Surrebutter !!!!!!! ETC ! ETC !! ETC !!! It may not be . The Muse — As ladies often are — Though lovely , is obstinate , And will have her own way !</p>
     <p>And am I not As well as a Q. S ., An F. R. S . And LL. D .? Ask BLACKWOOD The reason why , and he will tell you , So will the Mayor — The MAYOR OF HULL ! I obey , Spirit . Hang my brief — ‘ tis gone !— To-morrow let my junior cram me in Court . Whither away ? Where am I ? What is it I behold ? In space , or out of space ? I know not . In fact I 've not the least idea if I 'm crazy . Or sprung — sprung ? I 've only had a pint of Port at dinner And can n't be sprung — Oh , no !— Shame on the thought ! I see a coach !— Is it a coach ? Not exactly . Yet it has wheels — Wheels within wheels — and on the box A driver , and a cad behind , And Horses — Horses ?— Bethink thee — Worm !— Are they Horses ? or that race Lower than Horses , but with longer ears And less intelligence — In fact — “ EQUI ASINI , ” Or in vernacular JACKASSES ? ‘ Tis not a coach exactly — Now I see on the panels — Pricked out and flourished — A word ! A magic word — “ THE DILLY ! ” — “ THE DERBY DILLY ! ” Oh Dilly ! Dilly !— all thy passengers Are outsiders — The road is rough and rutty — And thy driver , like NIMSHI 'S son — Driveth Furiously ! And the cad upon the monkey-board The monkey-board behind , Scorneth the drag — but goes Downhill like mad . He hath a Caucasian brow ! A son of SHEM , is he , Not of HAM — Nor JAPHETH — In fact a Jew — But see , the pace Grows faster — and more fast — in fact — I may say A case of Furious driving ! Take care , you 'll be upset — Look out ! Holloa !</p>
     <p>Horrible ! Horrible !! Horrible !! The Dilly — With all its precious freight Of men and Manners — Is gone ! Gone to immortal SMASH ! Pick up the pieces ! Let me wipe my eyes ! Oh Muse — lend me my scroll To do it with , for I have lost My wipe !</p>
     <p>PART SECOND</p>
     <p>* * * Again upon the road The road to where ? To nowhere in particular ! Ah , no — I thank thee , Muse — That hint — ‘ tis a finger-post , And “ he that runs may read ” — He that runs ? But I am not running — I am riding — How came I here ?— what am I riding on ? Who are my fellow-passengers ? Ah , ha ! I recognize them now ! The Coach — The Box — The Driver — And the Cad — I 'm on the Dilly , and the Dilly Is on the road again And now I see That finger-post ! It saith “ To Oxford Fifty-two miles . ” And , hark ! a chorus ! From all the joyous load , Driver and cad , and all ! “ We go , ” they sing — To OXFORD TO BE DOCTORED . ” To be Doctored ? Then , wherefore Are ye so cheerful ? I was not cheerful in my early days — Days of my buoyant boyhood — When , after inglutition Of too much Christmas pudding , Or Twelfth cake saccharine , I went , as we go now , To be Doctored ! Salts ! Senna and Rhubarb !! Jalap and Ipecacuanha !!! And Antimonial Wine !!!! “ WORM ! IDIOT !! DONKEY !!! ” Said the free-spoken Muse “ With them thou goest to be doctored , too , Not in medicine — but in Law — All these — and thou — Are going to be made HONORARY LL. D. s ! Behold ! And know thy company Be thou familiar with them , But by no means vulgar — For familiarity breeds contempt ; And no man is a hero To his VALET-DE-CHAMBRE ! So ponder and perpend . ” DERBY ! The wise , the meek , the chivalrous — Mirror of knightly graces And daily dodges ; Who always says the right things At the right time , And never forgets himself as others — Nor changes his side Nor his opinion — A STANLEY to the core , as ready To fight As erst on FLODDEN FIELD His mail-clad ancestor .— See the poem Of MARMION , By SIR WALTER SOOTT ! DIZZY ! Dark — supple — subtle — With mind lithe as the limbs Of ISHMAEL 'S sons , his swart progenitors — With tongue sharp as the spear That o'er Sahara Flings the blue shadow Of the crown of ostrich feathers — As described so graphically By LAYARD , in his recent book On Nineveh ! With tongue as sharp As aspic 's tooth of NILUS , Or sugary Upon the occasion As is the date Of TAFILAT . DIZZY , the bounding Arab Of the political arena — As swift to whirl Right about face — As strong to leap From premise to conclusion — As great in balancing A budget — Or flinging headlong His somersets Over sharp swords of adverse facts , As were his brethren of EL-ARISH , Who Some years ago exhibited — With rapturous applause — At Astley 's Amphitheater — And subsequently At Vauxhall Gardens !</p>
     <p>Clustering , front and back On box and knife-board , See , petty man ; Behold ! and thank thy stars That led thee — Worm — THEE , that art merely a writer And a barrister , Although a man of elegant acquirements , A gentleman and a scholar — Nay , F. R. S . to boot — Into such high society , Among such SWELLS , And REAL NOBS ! Behold ! ten live LORDS ! and lo *! no end Of Ex-Cabinet Ministers ! Oh ! happy , happy , happy , Oh , happy SAM ! Say , is n't this worth , at the least “ TEN THOUSAND A YEAR ! ”</p>
     <p>And these are all , to day at least — -  Thy fellows ! Going to be made LL. D. s , even as thyself — And thou shalt walk in silk attire . And hob and nob with all the mighty of the earth , And lunch in Hall — In Hall ! Where lunched before thee , But on inferior grub , That first great SAM — SAM JOHNSON ! And LAUD , and ROGER BACON , And CRANMER , LATIMER , And RIDLEY , And CYRIL JACKSON — and a host besides , Whom at my leisure I will look up In WOOD 'S “ ATHENAE OXONIENSES ” Only to think ! How BLACKWOOD Is honored ! ALISON ! AYTOUN ! BULWER !!! And last , not least The great SAM GANDERAM !!!! Oh EBONY ! Oh MAGA ! And oh Our noble selves !</p>

     <p>THE DIRGE OF THE DRINKER . BY W ——— E ——— A ———, ESQ . WILLIAM AYTOUN .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Brothers , spare awhile your liquor , lay your final tumbler down ;</l>
       <l n="2">He has dropp 'd — that star of honor — on the field of his renown !</l>
       <l n="3">Raise the wail , but raise it softly , lowly bending on your knees ,</l>
       <l n="4">If you find it more convenient , you may hiccup if you please .</l>
       <l n="5">Sons of Pantagruel , gently let your hip-hurraing sink ,</l>
       <l n="6">Be your manly accents clouded , half with sorrow , half with drink !</l>
       <l n="7">Lightly to the sofa pillow lift his head from off the floor ;</l>
       <l n="8">See how calm he sleeps , unconscious as the deadest nail in door !</l>
       <l n="9">Widely o'er the earth I 've wander 'd ; where the drink most freely</l>
       <l n="10">flow 'd ,</l>
       <l n="11">I have ever reel 'd the foremost , foremost to the beaker strode .</l>
       <l n="12">Deep in shady Cider Cellars I have dream 'd o'er heavy wet ,</l>
       <l n="13">By the fountains of Damascus I have quaff 'd the rich Sherbet ,</l>
       <l n="14">Regal Montepulciano drained beneath its native rock ,</l>
       <l n="15">On Johannis ’ sunny mountain frequent hiccup 'd o'er my hock ;</l>
       <l n="16">I have bathed in butts of Xeres deeper than did e'er Monsoon ,</l>
       <l n="17">Sangaree 'd with bearded Tartars in the Mountains of the Moon ;</l>
       <l n="18">In beer-swilling Copenhagen I have drunk your Danesman blind ,</l>
       <l n="19">I have kept my feet in Jena , when each bursch to earth declined ;</l>
       <l n="20">Glass for glass , in fierce Jamaica , I have shared the planter 's rum ,</l>
       <l n="21">Drank with Highland dhuinie-wassels till each gibbering Gael grew</l>
       <l n="22">dumb ;</l>
       <l n="23">But a stouter , bolder drinker — one that loved his liquor more —</l>
       <l n="24">Never yet did I encounter than our friend upon the floor !</l>
       <l n="25">Yet the best of us are mortal , we to weakness all are heir ,</l>
       <l n="26">He has fallen , who rarely stagger 'd — let the rest of us beware !</l>
       <l n="27">We shall leave him , as we found him — lying where his manhood fell ,</l>
       <l n="28">‘ Mong the trophies of the revel , for he took his tipple well .</l>
       <l n="29">Better't were we loosed his neckcloth , laid his throat and bosom bare ,</l>
       <l n="30">Pulled his Hobi 's off , and turn 'd his toes to taste the breezy air .</l>
       <l n="31">Throw the sofa cover o'er him , dim the flaring of the gas ,</l>
       <l n="32">Calmly , calmly let him slumber , and , as by the bar we pass ,</l>
       <l n="33">We shall bid that thoughtful waiter place beside him , near and handy ,</l>
       <l n="34">Large supplies of soda water , tumblers bottomed well with brandy ,</l>
       <l n="35">So when waking , he shall drain them , with that deathless thirst of</l>
       <l n="36">his ,</l>
       <l n="37">Clinging to the hand that smote him , like a good ‘ un as he is !</l>

     <p>FRANCESCA DA RIMINI . TO BON GAULTIER . WILLIAM AYTOUN .</p>
     <p>ARGUMENT-An impassioned pupil of Leigh Hunt , having met Bon Gaultier at a Fancy Ball , declares the destructive consequences thus :</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Didst thou not praise me , Gaultier , at the ball ,</l>
       <l n="2">Ripe lips , trim boddice , and a waist so small ,</l>
       <l n="3">With clipsome lightness , dwindling ever less ,</l>
       <l n="4">Beneath the robe of pea-y greeniness !</l>
       <l n="5">Dost thou remember , when with stately prance ,</l>
       <l n="6">Our heads went crosswise in the country dance ;</l>
       <l n="7">How soft , warm fingers , tipp 'd like buds of balm ,</l>
       <l n="8">Trembled within the squeezing of thy palm ;</l>
       <l n="9">And how a cheek grew flush 'd and peachy-wise</l>
       <l n="10">At the frank lifting of thy cordial eyes ?</l>
       <l n="11">Ah , me ! that night there was one gentle thing ,</l>
       <l n="12">Who like a dove , with its scarce-feather 'd wing ,</l>
       <l n="13">Flutter 'd at the approach of thy quaint swaggering !</l>
       <l n="14">There 's wont to be , at conscious times like these ,</l>
       <l n="15">An affectation of a bright-eyed ease —</l>
       <l n="16">A crispy-cheekiness , if so I dare</l>
       <l n="17">Describe the swaling of a jaunty air ;</l>
       <l n="18">And thus , when swirling from the waltz 's wheel ,</l>
       <l n="19">You craved my hand to grace the next quadrille .</l>
       <l n="20">That smiling voice , although it made me start ,</l>
       <l n="21">Boil 'd in the meek o'erlifting of my heart ;</l>
       <l n="22">And , picking at my flowers , I said with free</l>
       <l n="23">And usual tone , “ Oh yes , sir , certainly ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="24">Like one that swoons , ‘ twixt sweet amaze and fear ,</l>
       <l n="25">I heard the music burning in my ear ,</l>
       <l n="26">And felt I cared not , so thou wert with me ,</l>
       <l n="27">If Gurth or Wamba were our vis-a-vis .</l>
       <l n="28">So , when a tall Knight Templar ringing came ,</l>
       <l n="29">And took his place against us with his dame ,</l>
       <l n="30">I neither turned away , nor bashful shrunk</l>
       <l n="31">From the stern survey of the soldier-monk ,</l>
       <l n="32">Though rather more than full three-quarters drunk ;</l>
       <l n="33">But threading through the figure , first in rule ,</l>
       <l n="34">I paused to see thee plunge into La Poule .</l>
       <l n="35">Ah , what a sight was that ? Not prurient Mars ,</l>
       <l n="36">Pointing his toe through ten celestial bars —</l>
       <l n="37">Not young Apollo , beamily array 'd</l>
       <l n="38">In tripsome guise for Juno 's masquerade —</l>
       <l n="39">Not smartest Hermes , with his pinion girth ,</l>
       <l n="40">Jerking with freaks and snatches down to earth ,</l>
       <l n="41">Look 'd half so bold , so beautiful and strong ,</l>
       <l n="42">As thou when pranking thro ’ the glittering throng !</l>
       <l n="43">How the calm 'd ladies looked with eyes of love</l>
       <l n="44">On thy trim velvet doublet laced above ;</l>
       <l n="45">The hem of gold , that , like a wavy river ,</l>
       <l n="46">Flowed down into thy back with glancing shiver !</l>
       <l n="47">So bare was thy fine throat , and curls of black</l>
       <l n="48">So lightsomely dropp 'd on thy lordly back .</l>
       <l n="49">So crisply swaled the feather in thy bonnet ,</l>
       <l n="50">So glanced thy thigh , and spanning palm upon it ,</l>
       <l n="51">That my weak soul took instant flight to thee ,</l>
       <l n="52">Lost in the fondest gush of that sweet witchery !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="53">But when the dance was o'er , and arm in arm</l>
       <l n="54">( The full heart beating ‘ gainst the elbow warm ) ,</l>
       <l n="55">We pass 'd to the great refreshment hall ,</l>
       <l n="56">Where the heap 'd cheese-cakes and the comfits small</l>
       <l n="57">Lay , like a hive of sunbeams , to burn</l>
       <l n="58">Around the margin of the negus urn ;</l>
       <l n="59">When my poor quivering hand you finger 'd twice ,</l>
       <l n="60">And , with inquiring accents , whisper 'd “ Ice ,</l>
       <l n="61">Water , or cream ? ” I could no more dissemble ,</l>
       <l n="62">But dropp 'd upon the couch all in a tremble .</l>
       <l n="63">A swimming faintness misted o'er my brain ,</l>
       <l n="64">The corks seem 'd starting from the brisk champagne ,</l>
       <l n="65">The custards fell untouch 'd upon the floor ,</l>
       <l n="66">Thine eyes met mine . That night we danced no more !</l>

     <p>Mister Buckinum , the follerin Billet was writ hum by a Yung feller of Our town that wuz cussed fool enuff to goe atrottin inter Miss Chiff arter a Drum and fife . It ai n't Nater for a feller to let on that he 's sick o ’ any bizness that He went intu off his own free will and a Cord , but I rather callate he 's middlin tired o ’ voluntearin By this Time . I bleeve u may put dependunts on his statemence . For I never heered nothin bad on him let Alone his havin what Parson Wilbur cals a PONGSHONG for cocktales , and he ses it wuz a soshiashun of idees sot him agoin arter the Crootin Sargient cos he wore a cocktale onto his hat .</p>
     <p>his Folks gin the letter to me and I shew it to parson Wilbur and he ses it oughter Bee printed , send It to mister Buckinum , ses he , I do n't ollers agree with him , ses he , but by Time , says he , I DU like a feller that ai n't a Feared .</p>
     <p>I have intusspussed a Few refleckshuns hear and thair . We 're kind o ’ Prest with Hayin . Ewers respecfly HOSEA BIGLOW .</p>
     <p>This kind o ’ sogerin ’ aint a mite like our October trainin ’ , A chap could clear right out from there ef ‘ t only looked like rainin ’ . An ’ th ’ Cunnles , tu , could kiver up their shappoes with bandanners , An ’ send the insines skootin ’ to the bar-room with their banners , ( Fear o ’ gittin ’ on ‘ em spotted ) , an ’ a feller could cry quarter Ef he fired away his ramrod arter tu much rum an ’ water . Recollect wut fun we hed , you ‘ n I an ’ Ezry Hollis , Up there to Waltham plain last fall , ahavin ’ the Cornwallis ? [ Footnote : i halt the Site of a feller with a muskit as I do plze But their is fun to a Cornwallis I ai n't agoin to deny it .— H. B . ] This sort o ’ thing aint JEST like thet — I wish thet I wuz furder - [ Footnote : he means Not quite so fur i guess .— H. B . ] Nimepunce a day fer killin ’ folks comes kind o ’ low fer murder ( Wy I 've worked out to slarterin ’ some for Deacon Cephas Billins , An ’ in the hardest times there wuz I ollers tetched ten shillins ) , There 's sutthin ’ gits into my throat thet makes it hard to swaller , It comes so nateral to think about a hempen collar ; It 's glory — but , in spite o ’ all my tryin to git callous , I feel a kind o ’ in a cart , aridin ’ to the gallus . But when it comes to BEIN ’ killed — I tell ye I felt streaked The fust time ever I found out wy baggonets wuz peaked , Here 's how it wuz : I started out to go to a fandango , The sentinul he ups an ’ sez , “ Thet 's furder ‘ an you can go ” “ None o ’ your sarse , ” sez I ; sez he , “ Stan ’ back ! ” “ Aint you a buster . Sez I , “ I 'm up to all thet air , I guess I 've ben to muster ; I know wy sentinuls air sot ; you aint agoin ’ to eat us ; Caleb haint to monopoly to court the seenoreetas ; My folks to hum air full ez good ez hisn be , by golly ! ” An ’ so ez I wuz goin ’ by , not thinkin ’ ; wut would folly , The everlatin ’ cus he stuck his one-pronged pitchfork in me An ’ made a hole right thru my close ez ef I wuz an in'my . Wal , it beats all how big I felt hoorawin ’ in ole Funnel Wen Mister Bolles he gin the sword to our Leftenant Cunnle ( It 's Mister Secondary Bolles ,* thet writ the prize peace essay , *[ Footnote : the ignerant creeter means Sekketary ; but he ollers stuck to his books like cobbler 's wax to an ile-stone .— H . B . ] Thet 's wy he did n't list himself along o ’ us , I dessay ) , An ’ Rantoul , tu , talked pooty loud , but dont ’ put HIS foot in it , Coz human life 's so sacred thet he 's principled agin'it — Though I myself can n't rightly see it 's any wus achokin ’ on ‘ em Than puttin ’ bullets thru their lights , or with a bagnet pokin ’ on ‘ em ; How dreffle slick he reeled it off ( like Blitz at our lyceum Ahaulin ’ ribbins from his chops so quick you skeercely see ‘ em ) , About the Anglo-Saxon race ( an ’ saxons would be handy To do the buryin ’ down here upon the Rio Grandy ) , About our patriotic pas an ’ our star-spangled banner , Our country 's bird alookin ’ on an ’ singin ’ out hosanner , An ’ how he ( Mister B himself ) wuz happy fer Ameriky — I felt , ez sister Patience sez , a leetle mite histericky . I felt , I swon , ez though it wuz a dreffle kind o ’ privilege Atrampin ’ round thru Boston streets among the gutter 's drivelage ; I act'lly thought it wuz a treat to hear a little drummin , An ’ it did bonyfidy seem millanyum wuz acomin ’ Wen all on us got suits ( darned like them wore in the state prison ) An ’ every feller felt ez though all Mexico wuz hisn . [ Footnote : It must be aloud that thare 's a streak o ’ nater in lovin ’ sho , but it sartinly is of the curusest things in nater to see a rispecktable dri goods dealer ( deekon off a chutch mayby ) a riggin ’ himself out in the Weigh they du and struttin ’ round in the Reign aspilin ’ his trowsis and makin ’ wet goods of himself . E fany thin 's foolisher and moor dicklus than militerry gloary it is milishy gloary .— H . B ] This ‘ ere 's about the meanest place a skunk could wal diskiver ( Saltillo 's Mexican , I b'lieve , fer wut we call Saltriver ) . The sort o ’ trash a feller gits to eat doos beat all nater , I 'd give a year 's pay fer a smell o ’ one good bluenose tater ; The country here thet Mister Bolles declared to be so charmin ’ Throughout is swarmin ’ with the most alarmin ’ kind o ’ varmin ’ . He talked about delishis froots , but then it wuz a wopper all , The holl o n't ‘ s mud an ’ prickly pears , with here an ’ there a chapparal ; You see a feller peekin ’ out , an ’ , fust you know , a lariat Is round your throat en ’ you a copse , ‘ fore you can say , “ Wut air ye at ? ” [ Footnote : these fellers are verry proppilly called Rank Heroes , and the more tha kill the ranker and more Herowick tha bekum .— H . B . ] You never see sech darned gret bugs ( it may not be irrelevant To say I 've seen a SCARABAEUS PILULARIUS big ez a year old elephant ) , [ Footnote : It wuz “ tumblebug ” as he Writ it , but the parson put the Latten instid . I sed tother maid better meeter , but he said tha was eddykated peepl to Boston and tha would n't stan ’ it no how . Idnow as tha WOOOD and idnow as tha wood .— H . B . ] The rigiment come up one day in time to stop a red bug From runnin ’ off with Cunnle Wright — ‘ t wuz jest a common CIMEX LECTULARIUS . One night I started up on eend an ’ thought I wuz to hum agin , I heern a horn , thinks I it 's Sol the fisherman hez come agin , HIS bellowses is sound enough — ez I 'm a livin ’ creeter , I felt a thing go thru my leg — ‘ t wuz nothin ’ more ‘ n a skeeter ! Then there 's the yaller fever , tu , they call it here el vomito — ( Come , thet wu n't du , you landcrab there , I tell ye to le ’ GO my toe ! My gracious ! it 's a scorpion thet 's took a shine to play with ‘ t , I dars n't skeer the tarnal thing fer fear he 'd run away with ‘ t ) . Afore I come away from hum I hed a strong persuasion Thet Mexicans wor n't human beans *— an ourang outang nation , *[ Footnote : he means human beins , that 's wut he means . I spose he kinder thought tha wuz human beans ware the Xisle Poles comes from .— H . B . ] A sort o ’ folks a chap could kill an ’ never dream o n't arter , No more'n a feller 'd dream o ’ pigs thet he hed hed to slarter ; I 'd an idee thet they were built arter the darkle fashion all , An ’ kickin ’ colored folks about , you know , ‘ s a kind o ’ national But when I jined I wor n't so wise ez thet air queen o ’ Sheby , Fer , come to look at ‘ em , they aint much diff'rent from wut we be An ’ here we air ascrougin ’ ‘ em out o ’ thir own dominions , Ashelterin ’ ‘ em , ez Caleb sez , under our eagle 's pinions , “ Wich means to take a feller up jest by the slack o ’ ‘ s trowsis An ’ walk him Spanish clean right out o ’ all his homes an ’ houses Wal , it doos seem a curus way , but then hooraw fer Jackson ! It must be right , fer Caleb sez it 's reg'lar AnglohYpppHeNSaxon . The Mex'cans do n't fight fair , they say , they piz'n all the water , An ’ du amazin ’ lots o ’ things thet is n't wut they ough ’ ter ; Bein ’ they haint no lead , they make their bullets out o ’ copper An ’ shoot the darned things at us , tu , which Caleb sez aint proper ; He sez they 'd ough ’ to stan ’ right up an ’ let us pop ‘ em fairly ( Guess wen he ketches ‘ em at thet he 'll hev to git up airly ) , Thet our nation 's bigger ‘ n theirn an ’ so its rights air bigger , An thet it 's all to make ‘ em free that we air pullin ’ trigger , Thet Anglo Saxondom 's idee 's abreakin ’ ‘ em to pieces , An ’ thet idee 's thet every man doos jest wut he damn pleases ; Ef I do n't make his meanin ’ clear , perhaps in some respex I can , I know that “ every man ” do n't mean a nigger or a Mexican ; An ’ there 's another thing I know , an ’ thet is , ef these creeturs , Thet stick an Anglo-saxon mask onto State-prison feeturs , Should come to Jaalam Center fer to argify an ’ spout o n't , The gals ‘ ould count the silver spoons the minnit they cleared out o n't</p>
     <p>This goin ’ ware glory waits ye haint one agreeable feetur , An ’ ef it wor n't fer wakin ’ snakes , I 'd home agin short meter ; O , would n't I be off , quick time , ef't wor n't thet I wuz sartin They 'd let the daylight into me to pay me fer desartin ! I do n't approve o ’ tellin ’ tales , but jest to you I may state Our ossifers aint wut they wuz afore they left the Baystate Then it wuz “ Mister Sawin , sir , you 're middlin ’ well now , be ye ? Step up an ’ take a nipper , sir ; I 'm dreffle glad to see ye ; ” But now it 's “ Ware 's my eppylet ? here , Sawin , step an fetch it ! An ’ mind your eye , be thund'rin ’ spry , or , damn ye , you shall ketch it ! ” Wal , ez the Doctor sez , some pork will bile so , but by mighty , Ef I bed some on ‘ em to hum , I 'd give ‘ em linkum vity , I 'd play the rogue 's march on their hides an ’ other [ illeg ] follerin ’ — But I must close my letter here , for one on ‘ em 's a-hollerin ’ , These Anglosaxon ossifers — wal , taint no use ajawin ’ , I 'm safe enlisted fer the war , Yourn , BIRDOFREEDOM SAWIN</p>

     <p>ALARMING PROSPECT PUNCH . To the Editor of “ PUNCH . ”</p>
     <p>SIR — You are aware , of course , that in the progress of a few centuries the language of a country undergoes a great alteration ; that the Latin of the Augustan age was very different from that of the time of Tarquin ; and no less so from that which prevailed at the fall of the Roman empire . Also , that the Queen 's English is not precisely what it was in Elizabeth 's days ; to say nothing of its variation from what was its condition under the Plantagenets .</p>
     <p>I observe , with regret , that our literature is becoming conversational , and our conversation corrupt . The use of cant phraseology is daily gaining ground among us , and this evil will speedily infect , if it has not already infected , the productions of our men of letters . I fear most for our poetry , because what is vulgarly termed SLANG is unfortunately very expressive , and therefore peculiarly adapted for the purposes of those whose aim it is to clothe “ thoughts that breathe ” in “ words that burn ; ” and , besides , it is in many instances equivalent to terms and forms of speech which have long been recognized among poetical writers as a kind of current coin .</p>
     <p>The peril which I anticipate I have endeavored to exemplify in the following</p>

     <p>1 . “ Prigging , ” stealing ; as yet exclusively applied to petty larceny . “ Stealing ” is as well known to be a poetical term as it is to be an indictable offense ; the Zephyr and the Vesper Hymn , cum multis aliis , are very prone to this practice . 2 . “ Swigging , ” drinking copiously — of malt liquor in particular . “ Pearly drops of dew we drink . ” — OLD SONG . 3 . “ Plummiest , ” the superlative of “ plummy , ” exquisitely delicious ; an epithet commonly used by young gentlemen in speaking of a bonne bouche or “ tit bit , ” as a mince pie , a preserved apricot , or an oyster patty . The transference of terms expressive of delightful and poignant savor to female beauty , is common with poets . “ Death , that hath sucked the honey of thy breath . ” — SHAKESPEARE . “ Charley loves a pretty girl , AS SWEET AS SUGAR CANDY . ” — ANON . 4 . “ Nutty , ” proper — in the old English sense of “ comely , ” “ handsome . ” “ Six PROPER youths , and tall . ” — OLD SONG . 5 . “ Nob , ” a person of consequence ; a word very likely to be patronized , from its combined brevity and significancy . 6 . “ Spicy , ” very smart and pretty ; it has the same recommendation , and will probably supplant the old favorite “ bonny . ” “ Busk ye , busk ye , my bonny , bonny bride . ” — HAMILTON . 7 . “ Young'un , ” youth , young man . “ A YOUTH to fortune and to fame unknown . ” — GRAY . 8 . “ Gov'nor , ” or “ guv'nor , ” a contraction of “ governor , ” a father . It will , no doubt , soon supersede sire , which is at present the poetical equivalent for the name of the author of one 's existence . See all the poets , passim . 9 . “ Said as how he 'd never fight , ” the thing was out of the question ; a metaphorical phrase , though certainly , at present , a vulgar one . 10 . “ Snooze , ” slumber personified , like “ Morpheus , ” or “ Somnus . ” 11 . “ Daddle . ” — Q. from daktulos , a finger — pars pro toto !— Hand , the only synonym for it that we have , except “ Paw , ” “ Mawley , ” &amp; c ., which are decidedly generis ejusdem. 12 . “ His'n , ” his own ; corresponding to the Latin suus , his own and nobody else 's , so frequently met with in OVID and others . 13 . “ Crack , ” a twinkling , an extremely short interval of time , which was formerly expressed , in general , by a periphrasis ; as , “ Ere the leviathan can swim a league ! ” — SHAKESPEARE . 14 . “ Cut , ” sped . A synonym . 15 . “ Squatted , ” sat . Id . 16 . “ Davy , ” affidavit , solemn oath . Significant and euphonious , therefore alluring to the versifier . 17 . “ Do n't I , just ? ” A question for a strong affirmation , as , “ Oh , yes , indeed I do ; ” a piece of popular rhetoric , pithy and forcible and consequently almost sure to be adopted — especially by the pathetic writers . 18 . “ Bolt , ” ran away . Syn . 19 . “ Bumptious , ” fearless , bold , and spirited ; a very energetic expression such as those rejoice in who would fair “ DENHAM 'S strength with Waller 's sweetness join . ” 20 . “ That wo n't pay , ” that plan will never answer . Metaph . 21 . “ Come down , ” disburse ; also rendered in the vernacular by “ fork out . ” etc . Id . 22 . “ Cove , ” swain . “ Alexis shunn 'd his fellow SWAINS . ” — PRIOR . See also SHENSTONE PASSIM . 23 . “ Mull 'd , ” equivalent to “ wreck 'd , ” a term of pathos . 24 . “ Kinchin-bud , ” infant-bud . Metaph . ; moreover , very tender , sweet , and touching , as regards the idea . 25 . “ My tulip , ” a term of endearment . “ Fairest FLOWER , all flowers excelling . ” ODE TO A CHILD : COTTON . 26 . “ The bucket kick , ” pleonasm for die ; as , “ to breathe life 's latest sigh . ” — “ To yield the soul , ” — “ the breath , ” — or , UT APUD ANTIQ . “ Animam expirare , ” seu “ efflare , ” etc . 27 . “ Chouse , ” cheat . Syn . 28 . “ Cutting . . . our stick . ” Pleon . ut supra . 29 . “ Here 's unto mine ! ” A form of speech analogous to “ Have at thee . ” — SHAKESPEARE , and the dramatists generally . 30 . “ Oh , my eye ! ” an interjectional phrase , tantamount to “ Oh , heavens ! ” “ Merciful powers ! ” etc . 31 . “ Cold crib , ” cold bed . “ Go to thy cold bed and warm thee . ” — SHAK . 32 . “ Draw it mild , ” etc . Metaph . for “ Rule your passions , and beware ! ”</p>
     <p>I doubt not that it will be admitted by your judicious readers that I have substantiated my case . Our monarchical institutions may preserve our native tongue for a time , but if it does not become , at no very distant period , as strange a medley as that of the American is at present — to use the expressive but peculiar idiom of that people — “ IT 'S A PITY . ” I am , sir , etc ., P .</p>

But that makes me more ‘ appy . I 'm glad to be distressed in body . It serves me right . But in mind I 'm ‘ appy : leastways almost ‘ appy . ” “ ‘ Ave you hany wish to express , ” says he : “ is there any request as you would like to make . ” “ ‘ AWKER 'S HEVENING POTION , sir , ” says I , “ and the DAIRYMAN 'S DAUGHTER : if ‘ AWKER 'S HEVENING POTION was but mine — and the DAIRYMAN 'S DAUGHTER — I think , sir , I should be quite ‘ appy . ” “ My friend , ” says the parson , “ your desire shall be attended to , ” and hout he valked : me a takin ’ a sight at ‘ im be'ind ‘ is back ; for as soon as I thought he wos out of ‘ earin ’ , sings I to myself — “ Ven a prig , ” etc</p>

     </lg>
     <p>( Spoken . ) Won day he comes to me arter service , and axes me what I thought : I could do for myself in the way of yarnin a honest liveliwood , if so be as I was to be allowed my liberty and to go back to the world . “ Ah ! sir , ” says I , “ I do n't think no longer about the world . ‘ Tis a world of sorrow and wanity , I hav n't given a thought to what I should do in it ” “ Every one , ” says the Chapling “ has his sphere of usefulness in society ; can you think of no employment which you have the desire and ability to follow ? ” “ Well , sir , ” says I “ if there is a wocation which I should feel delight and pleasure in follerin ‘ tis that of a Scripter Reader . But I ai n't worthy to be a Scripter Reader . A coal-porter of tracts and religious books , sir , I thinks that 's what I should like to try and be , if the time of my just punishment was up . But there 's near seven year , sir , to think about that — and p'raps ‘ tis better for me to be here . ” That 's the way I used to soap the Chapling — Cos vy ? “ Ven a prig , ” etc . So he thought I kissed the rod , All the while my ‘ art was ‘ ardened ; And I ‘ ad n't been very long in quod Afore he got me as good as pardoned ; And here am I with my Ticket of Leave , Obtained by shamming pious feeling , Which lets me loose again to thieve , For I means to persewere in stealing .</p>
     <p>( Spoken . ) With which resolution , my beloved pals , if you please I 'll couple the ‘ elth of the clergy ; and may they hever continue to be sitch kind friends as they now shows theirselves to us when we gets into trouble . For , “ Ven a prig , ” etc .</p>

     <p>RIDDLES BY DEAN SWIFT AND HIS FRIENDS . [ Footnote : The following notice is subjoined to some of those riddles , in the Dublin edition : “ About nine or ten years ago ( i. e. about 1724 ) , some ingenious gentle-men , friends to the author , used to entertain themselves with writing riddles , and send them to him and their other acquaintance ; copies of which ran about , and some of them were printed , both here and in England . The author , at his leisure hours , fell into the same amusement ; although it be said that he thought them of no great merit , entertainment , or use . However , by the advice of some persons , for whom the author has a great esteem , and who were pleased to send us the copies , we have ventured to print the few following , as we have done two or three before , and which are allowed to be genuine ; because we are informed that several good judges have a taste for such kind of compositions . ” ]</p>

       <l n="3">ANONYMOUS — To Punch 's Almanac , for 1856 , we are indebted for an account</l>
       <l n="4">of this prolific writer :</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Of Anon , ” says Punch , “ but little is known , though his works are excessively numerous . He has dabbled in every thing . Prose and Poetry are alike familiar to his pen . One moment he will be up the highest flights of philosophy , and the next he will be down in some kitchen garden of literature , culling an Enormous Gooseberry , to present it to the columns of some provincial newspaper . His contributions are scattered wherever the English language is read . Open any volume of Miscellanies at any place you will , and you are sure to fall upon some choice little bit signed by ‘ Anon . ’ What a mind his must have been ! It took in every thing like a pawnbroker 's shop . Nothing was too trifling for its grasp . Now he was hanging on to the trunk of an elephant and explaining to you how it was more elastic than a pair of India-rubber braces ; and next he would be constructing a suspension bridge with a series of monkey 's tails , tying them together as they do pocket - handkerchief 's in the gallery of a theater when they want to fish up a bonnet that has fallen into the pit .</p>
     <p>“ Anon is one of our greatest authors . If all the things which are signed with Anon 's name were collected on rows of shelves , he would require a British Museum all to himself . And yet of this great man so little is known that we are not even acquainted with his Christian name . There is no certificate of baptism , no moldy tombstone , no musty washing-bill in the world on which we can hook the smallest line of speculation whether it was John , or James , or Joshua , or Tom , or Dick , or Billy Anon . Shame that a man should write so much , and yet be known so little . Oblivion uses its snuffers , sometimes , very unjustly . On second thoughts , perhaps , it is as well that the works of Anon were not collected together . His reputation for consistency would not probably be increased by the collection . It would be found that frequently he had contradicted himself — - that in many instances when he had been warmly upholding the Christian white of a question he had afterward turned round , and maintained with equal warmth the Pagan black of it . He might often be discovered on both sides of a truth , jumping boldly from the right side over to the wrong , and flinging big stones at any one who dared to assail him in either position . Such double-sidedness would not be pretty , and yet we should be lenient to such inconsistencies . With one who had written so many thousand volumes , who had twirled his thoughts as with a mop on every possible subject , how was it possible to expect any thing like consistency ? How was it likely that he could recollect every little atom out of the innumerable atoms his pen had heaped up ?</p>
     <p>“ Anon ought to have been rich , but he lived in an age when piracy was the fashion , and when booksellers walked about , as it were , like Indian chiefs with the skulls of the authors they had slain , hung round their necks . No wonder , therefore , that we know nothing of the wealth of Anon . Doubtless he died in a garret , like many other kindred spirits , Death being the only score out of the many knocking at his door that he could pay . But to his immortal credit let it be said he has filled more libraries than the most generous patrons of literature . The volumes that formed the fuel of the barbarians ’ bonfire at Alexandria would be but a small book-stall by the side of the octavos , quartos , and duodecimos he has pyramidized on our book-shelves . Look through any catalogue you will , and you will find that a large proportion of the works in it have been contributed by Anon . The only author who can in the least compete with him in fecundity is Ibid . ”</p>
     <p>ANTI-JACOBIN , THE — - Perhaps the most famous collection of Political Satires extant . Originated by Canning in 1797 , it appeared in the form of a weekly newspaper , interspersed with poetry , the avowed object of which was to expose the vicious doctrines of the French Revolution , and to hold up to ridicule and contempt the advocates of that event , and the sticklers for peace and parliamentary reform . The editor was William Gifford , the vigorous and unscrupulous critic and poetaster the writers , Mr. John Hookham Frere , Mr. Jenkinson ( afterward Earl of Liverpool ) ; Mr. George Ellis , Lord Clare , Lord Mornington ( afterward Marquis Wellesley ) , Lord Morpeth ( afterward Earl of Carlisle ) , Baron Macdonald , and others . These gentlemen spared no means , fair or foul , in their attempts to blacken their adversaries . Their most distinguished countrymen , if opposed to the Tory government of the time being , were treated with no more respect than foreign adversaries , and were held up to public execration as traitors , blasphemers , and debauchees . The period was one of great political excitement , a fierce war with republican France being in progress , the necessity for which divided the public into two great parties ; national credit being affected , the Bank of England suspending cash payments , mutinies breaking out in the fleets at Spithead and the Nore , and Ireland at the verge of rebellion . Spain , also , had declared war against Britain , which was thus left to contend singly against the power of France . Party feeling running very high , the anti-Jacobins were by no means discriminating in their attacks , associating men together who really had nothing in common . Hence the reader is surprised to find Charles Lamb and other non-intruders into politics , figuring as congenial conspirators with Tom Paine . Fox , Sheridan , Erskine , and other eloquent liberals of the day , with Tierney , Home Tooke , and Coleridge were at the same tune writing and talking in the opposite extreme , and little quarter was given — certainly none on the part of the Tory wits . The poetry of the “ Anti-Jacobin , ” however , was not exclusively political , comprising also parodies and burlesques on the current literature of the day , some being of the highest degree of merit , and distinguished by sharp wit and broad humor of the happiest kind . In these , Canning and his coadjutors did a real service to letters , and assisted in a purification which Gifford , by his demolition of the Delia Cruscan school of poetry had so well begun . Perhaps no lines in the English language have been more effective or oftener quoted than Canning 's “ Friend of Humanity and the Knife Grinder . ” Many of the celebrated caricatures of Gilray were originally designed to illustrate the Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin . It had , however , but a brief , though brilliant existence . Wilberforce and others of the more moderate supporters of the ministry became alarmed at the boldness of the language employed . Pitt ( himself a contributor to the journal ) , was induced to interfere , and after a career of eight months , the “ Anti-Jacobin ” ( in its original form ) , ceased to be .</p>
     <p>AYTOUN , WILLIAM — Professor of Polite Literature in the Edinburg University : editor of “ Blackwood 's Magazine : ” son-in-law of the late Professor Wilson . Professor Aytoun was bred to the bar but , we believe , never came into practice . He is tha author of several humorous pieces , and of many in which the intention to be humorous was not realized . He is what the English call a very CLEVER man . Like many others who excel in ridicule and sarcasm , he is devoid of that kind of moral principle which makes a writer prefer the Just to the Dashing . Aytoun is a fierce Tory in politics — a snob on principle . The specimens of his humorous poetry contained in this collection were taken from the “ Ballads of Bon Gaultier , ” and the “ Idees Napoleoniennes , ” editions of both of which have been published in this country .</p>
     <p>BARHAM , REV . RICHARD HARRIS — Author of the celebrated “ Ingoldsby Legends , ” published originally in “ Bentley 's Miscellany , ” afterward collected and published in three volumes , with a memoir by a son of the author .</p>
     <p>Mr. Barham was born at Canterbury , England , December 6th , 1788 . His family is of great antiquity , having given its name to the well-known “ Barham Downs , ” between Dover and Canterbury . He was educated at St. Paul 's School in Canterbury , where he made the acquaintance of Richard Bentley , who afterward became his publisher . From this school , he wont to Oxford , entering Brazennose College , as a gentleman commoner , where he met Theodore Hook , and formed a friendship with that prince of wits which terminated only with Hook 's life . At the University , Barham led a wild , dissipated life — as the bad custom then was — and was noted as a wit and good fellow . Being called to account , on one occasion , by his tutor for his continued absence from morning prayer , Barham replied ,</p>
     <p>“ The fact is , sir , you are too LATE for me . ”</p>
     <p>“ Too late ? ” exclaimed the astonished tutor .</p>
     <p>“ Yes , sir , ” rejoined the student , “ I can not sit up till seven o'clock in the morning . I am a man of regular habits , and unless I get to bed by four or five , I am fit for nothing the next day . ”</p>
     <p>The tutor took this jovial reply seriously , and Barham perceiving that he was really wounded , offered a sincere apology , and afterward attended prayers more regularly .</p>
     <p>Entering the church , he devoted himself to his clerical duties with exemplary assiduity , and obtained valuable preferment , rising at length to be one of the Canons of St. Paul 's Cathedral . This office brought him into relations with Sydney Smith , with whom , though Barham was a Tory , he had much convivial intercourse .</p>
     <p>Very early in life Mr. Barham became an occasional contributor to Blackwood 's Magazine , then in the prime of its vigorous youth . The series of contributions called “ Family Poetry , ” which appear in the volumes for 1823 , and subsequent years , were by him . Most of those humorous effusions have been transferred to this volume . In 1837 Mr. Bentley established his “ Miscellany , ” and secured the services of his friend Barham , who , up to this time was unknown to the general public , though he had been for nearly twenty years a successful writer . The “ Ingoldsby Legends ” now appeared in rapid succession , and proved so popular that their author soon became one of the recognized wits of the day . A large number of these unique and excellent productions enrich the present collection , “ As respects these poems , ” says Mr. Barham 's biographer , “ remarkable as they have been pronounced for the wit and humor which they display , their distinguishing attractions lies in the almost unparalleled flow and felicity of the versification . Popular phrases , sentences the most prosaic , even the cramped technicalities of legal diction , and snatches from well-nigh every language , are wrought in with an apparent absence of all art and effort that surprises , pleases , and convulses the reader at every turn . The author triumphs with a master hand over every variety of stanza , however complicated or exacting ; not a word seems out of place , not an expression forced ; syllables the most intractable , and the only partners fitted for them throughout the range of language are coupled together as naturally as those kindred spirits which poets tell us were created pairs , and dispersed in space to seek out their particular mates . A harmony pervades the whole , a perfect modulation of numbers , never , perhaps , surpassed , and rarely equaled in compositions of their class . This was the forte of Thomas Ingoldsby ; a harsh line or untrue rhyme grated on his ear like the Shandean hinge . ” These observations are just . As a rhymer , Mr. Barham has but one equal in English literature — Byron .</p>
     <p>Mr. Barham died at London on the 17th of June , 1845 , in the fifty-seventh year of his age . He was an extremely amiable , benevolent character . It does not appear that his love of the humorous was ever allowed to interfere with the performance of his duties as a clergyman . Without being a great preacher , he was a faithful and kindly pastor , never so much in his element as when ministering to the distresses , or healing the differences of his parishioners . Unlike his friend , Sydney Smith , he was singularly fond of the drama , and for many years was a member of the Garrick Club . He was one of the few English writers of humorous verse , ALL of whose writings may be read aloud by a father to his family , and in whose wit there was no admixture of gall .</p>
     <p>“ BENTLEY 'S MISCELLANY ” — A London Monthly Magazine , founded about twenty years ago by Mr. Bentley , the publisher . Charles Dickens , and the author of the Ingoldsby Legends were among the first contributors .</p>
     <p>BLACKWOOD 'S MAGAZINE — First appeared in April , 1817 Founded by William Blackwood , a shrewd Edinburgh bookseller . Its literary ability and fierce political partisanship , soon placed it fore-most in the ranks of Tory periodicals . Perhaps no magazine has ever achieved such celebrity , or numbered such a host of illustrious contributors . John Wilson , the world-famous “ Christopher North , ” was the virtual , though not nominal editor , Blackwood himself retaining that title . It would be a long task to enumerate all , who , from the days of Sir Walter Scott and the Ettrick Shepherd , to those of Bulwer and Charles Mackay , have appeared in its columns . Maginn , Lockhart , Gillies , Moir , Landor , Wordsworth , Coleridge , Lamb , Bowles , Barry Cornwall , Gleig , Hamilton , Aird , Sym , De Quincey , Allan Cunningham , Mrs. Hemans , Jerrold , Croly , Warren , Ingoldsby ( Barham ) , Elizabeth Barrett Browning , Milnes , and many others , of scarcely less note , found in Blackwood scope for their productions , whether of prose or verse . In its early days much of personality and sarcasm marked its pages , savage onslaughts on Leigh Hunt , and “ the Cockney School of Literature , ” alternating with attacks on the Edinburgh Review , the Quarterly , and all Whigs and Whig productions whatever . The celebrated Noctes Ambrosianae , a series of papers containing probably more learning , wit , eloquence , eccentricity , humor , and personality than have ever appeared elsewhere , formed part of the individuality of Blackwood . They were written by Wilson , Maginn , Lockhart , and Hogg , the two first named ( and especially Wilson ) , having the pre-eminence . To the New York edition of this work , by Dr. Shelton Mackenzie ( whose notes contain a perfect mine of information ) , we refer the reader for further particulars relative to Blackwood .</p>
     <p>BROUGHAM , LORD — The well-known member of the English House of Peers . It seems , from some jocularities attributed to his lordship , that he adds to his many other claims to distinction that of being a man of wit .</p>
     <p>BRYANT , WILLIAM CULLEN — The most celebrated of American poets . Editor of the “ New York Evening Post . ” Born 1794 .</p>
     <p>BURNS , ROBERT — Born 1750 , died 1796 . The best loved , most national , most independent , truest , and greatest of Scottish poets , of whom to say more here were an impertinence .</p>
     <p>BUTLER , SAMUEL — Born in 1612 ; the son of a substantial farmer in Worcestershire , England . Very little is known of the earlier portion of his life , as he had reached the age of fifty before he was so much as heard of by his contemporaries . He appears to have received a good education at the cathedral school of his native county , and to have filled various situations , as clerk in the service of Thomas Jeffries of Earl 's Croombe , secretary to the Countess of Kent , and general man of business to Sir Samuel Luke , of Cople Hoo , Bedfordshire , who , it is said , served as the model for his hero , Hudibras . The first part of this singular poem was published at the close of 1662 , and met with extraordinary success . Its wit , its quaint sense and learning , its passages of sarcastic reflection on all manner of topics , and above all , its unsparing ridicule of men and things on the Puritan side , combined to render it a general favorite . The reception of Part II ., which appeared a year subsequent , was equally flattering . Yet its author seems to have fallen into the greatest poverty and obscurity , from which be never was enabled to emerge . It appears to have been his strange fate to flash all at once into notoriety , which lasted precisely two years , to fill the court and town during that time with continuous laughter , intermingled with inquiries who and what he was , and then for seventeen long years to plod on unknown and unregarded , still hearing his Hudibras quoted , and still preparing more of it , or matter similar , with no result . He died , in almost absolute destitution , in 1680 , and was buried at a friend 's expense , in the church-yard of St. Paul 's , Covent Garden .</p>
     <p>BYROM — A noted English Jacobite . Born 1691 .</p>
     <p>BYRON , GEORGE GORDON NOEL — Born 1788 , died in Greece , 1824 . Respecting his celebrated Satire on the poet Rogers , which appears in this collection , we read the following in a London periodical :— “ The satire on Rogers , by Lord Byron , is not surpassed for cool malignity , dexterous portraiture , and happy imagery , in the whole compass of the English language . It is said , and by those well informed , that Rogers used to bore Byron while in Italy , by his incessant minute dilettantism , and by visits at hours when Byron did not care to see him . One of many wild freaks to repel his unreasonable visits was to set his big dog at him . To a mind like Byron 's , here was sufficient provocation for a satire . The subject , too , was irresistible . Other inducements were not wanting . No man indulged himself more in sarcastic remarks on his cotemporaries than Mr. Rogers . He indulged his wit at any sacrifice . He spared no one , and Byron , consequently did not escape . Sarcastic sayings travel on electric wings — and one of Rogers 's personal and amusing allusions to Byron reached the ears of the poetic pilgrim at Ravenna . Few characters can bear the microscopic scrutiny of wit . Byron suffered . Fewer characters can bear its microscopic scrutiny when quickened by anger , and Rogers suffered still more severely .</p>
     <p>“ This , the greatest of modern satirical portraits in verse , was written before their final meeting at Bologna . Rogers was not aware that any saying of his had ever reached the ear of Byron , and Byron never published the verses on Rogers . They met like the handsome women described by Cibber , who , though they wished one another at the devil , are ‘ My dear , ’ and ‘ My dear , ’ whenever they meet . One doubtless considered his saying as something to be forgotten , and the other his verses as something not to be remembered . These verses are not included in Byron 's works , and are very little known . ”</p>
     <p>CHAUCER lived in the thirteenth century , dying in 1400 . He is designated the father of English poetry . The obsolete phraseology of his writings , though presenting a barrier to general appreciation and popularity , will never deter those who truly love the “ dainties that are bred in a book ” from holding him in affection and reverence . His chief work , the “ Canterbury Pilgrimage , ” “ well of English undefiled ” as it is , was written in the decline of life , when its author had passed his sixtieth year . For catholicity of spirit , love of nature , purity of thought , pathos , humor , subtle and minute discrimination of character and power of expressing it , Chaucer has one superior — Shakspeare .</p>
     <p>CHESTERFIELD , LORD — Born in 1694 ; died 1773 . Courtier , statesman , and man of the world ; famous for many things , but known to literature chiefly by his “ Letters to his Son , ” which have formed three generations of “ gentlemen , ” and still exert great influence . Chesterfield was a noted wit in his day , but most of his good things have been lost .</p>
     <p>CLEVELAND , JOHN — A political writer of Charles the First 's time ; author of several satirical pieces , now known only to the curious . He died in 1659 .</p>
     <p>COLERIDGE , SAMUEL TAYLOR — Poet , plagiarist , and opium-eater . Born at Bristol , in 1770 . Died near London in 1834 . He was a weak man of genius , whose reputation , formerly immense , has declined since he has been better known . But “ Christabel ” and the “ Ancient Mariner , ” will charm many generations of readers yet unborn . Most of the epigrams which appear in his works are ADAPTED from Leasing .</p>
     <p>COWPER , WILLIAM — The gentle poet of religious England : born 1731 ; died 1800 . Cowper was an elegant humorist , despite the gloominess of his religious belief . It is said , however , that his most comic effusions were written during periods of despondency .</p>
     <p>“ CRUIKSHANK 'S OMNIBUS ” — A monthly Magazine , published at the period of the artist 's greatest celebrity , principally as a vehicle for his pencil . Its editor was Laman Blanchard , a lively essayist , and amiable man , whom anticipations of pecuniary distress subsequently goaded to suicide .</p>
     <p>DEVREAUX , S. H .— An American scholar . Translator of “ Yriarte 's Fables , ” recently published in Boston .</p>
     <p>ERSKINE , THOMAS — One of the most eminent of English lawyers . Born 1750 ; died 1823 .</p>
     <p>FIELDING , HENRY — The great English Humorist ; author of “ Tom Jones ; ” born , 1707 ; died , 1754 .</p>
     <p>GAY , JOHN — A poet and satirist of the days of Queen Anne . Born 1688 ; died , 1732 . His wit , gentleness , humor , and animal spirits appear to have rendered him a general favorite . In worldly matters he was not fortunate , losing 20 , 000 pounds by the South Sea bubble ; nor did his interest , which was by no means inconsiderable , succeed in procuring him a place at court . He wrote fables , pastorals , the burlesque poem of “ Trivia , ” and plays , the most successful and celebrated of which is the “ Beggar 's Opera . ” Of this work there exists a sequel or second part , as full of wit and satire as the original , but much less known . Its performance was suppressed by Walpole , upon whom it was supposed to reflect .</p>
     <p>GRAY , THOMAS — Author of the “ Elegy written in a Country Church-yard ; ” Professor of Modern History in the University of Cambridge . Born in London , 1716 ; died , 1771 . Gray was learned in History , Architecture , and Natural History . As a poet , he was remarkable for the labor bestowed on his poems , for his reluctance to publish , and for the small number of his compositions . Carlyle thinks he is the only English poet who wrote less than he ought .</p>
     <p>HALPIX .—— -  — A writer for the press , a resident of New York , author of “ Lyrics by the Letter H , ” published a year or two since by Derby .</p>
     <p>HOLMES , OLIVER WENDELL — A physician of Boston , Professor of Anatomy in Harvard University ; born at Cambridge , Mass ., in 1809 . Dr. Holmes 's humorous verses are too well known to require comment in this place . His burlesque , entitled “ Evening , by a Tailor , ” is very excellent of its kind .</p>
     <p>HOOD , THOMAS — Author of the “ Song of the Shirt , ” which Punch had the honor of first publishing . Born in 1798 ; died in 1845 . Hood was the son of a London bookseller , and began life as a clerk . He became afterward an engraver , but was drawn gradually into the literary profession , which he exercised far more to the advantage of his readers than his own . His later years were saddened by ill-health and poverty . Some of his comic verses seem forced and contrived , as though done for needed wages . Hood was one of the literary men who should have made of literature a staff , not a crutch . It was in him to produce , like Lamb , a few very admirable things , the execution of which should have been the pleasant occupation of his leisure , not the toil by which he gained his bread .</p>
     <p>HUNT , JAMES HENRY LEIGH — English Journalist and Poet . Born in 1784 . His father was a clergyman of the Established church , and a man of wit and feeling .</p>
     <p>JOHNSON , DR. SAMUEL — Born 1709 ; died 1784 . Critic , moralist , lexicographer , and , above all , the hero of Boswell 's Life of Johnson . The ponderous philosopher did not disdain , occasionally , to give play to his elephantine wit .</p>
     <p>JONSON , BEN — Born 1574 ; died 1637 . Poet , playwright , and friend of Shakspeare , in whose honor he has left a noble eulogium . A manly , sturdy , laborious , English genius , of whose dramatic productions , however , but one ( “ Every Man in his Humor ” ) has retained possession of the stage . He is also the author of some exquisite lyrics . LAMB , CHARLES — Born in London , 1775 ; died , 1832 . As a humorous essayist , unrivaled and peculiar , he is known and loved by all who are likely to possess this volume .</p>
     <p>LANDOR , WALTER SAVAGE — A living English writer of considerable celebrity , author of “ Imaginary Conversations , ” contributor to several leading periodicals . Mr. Landor is now advanced in years . His humorous verses are few , and not of striking excellence .</p>
     <p>“ LANTERN , ” THE — A comic weekly , in imitation of “ Punch , ” published in this city a few years ago . The leading spirit of the “ Lantern ” was Mr. John Brougham , the well-known dramatist and actor .</p>
     <p>“ LEADER , ” THE — A London weekly newspaper , of liberal opinions ; ably written and badly edited , and , therefore , of limited circulation .</p>
     <p>LESSING , GOTTHOLD EPHRAIM — The well-known German author ; born 1729 ; died 1781 . The epigrams of Lessing have been so frequently stolen by English writers , that , perhaps , they may now be considered as belonging to English literature , and hence entitled to a place in this collection . At least we found the temptation to add them to our stock irresistible .</p>
     <p>LINDSAY — A friend of Dean Swift . A polite and elegant scholar ; an eminent pleader at the bar in Dublin , and afterward advanced to be one of the justices of the Common Pleas .</p>
     <p>LOWELL , JAMES RUSSELL — The American Poet . Born at Boston , in the year 1819 . To Mr. Lowell must be assigned a high , if not the highest place , among American writers of humorous poetry . The Biglow Papers , from which we have derived several excellent pieces for this volume , is one of the most ingenious and well-sustained jeux d'esprit in existence .</p>
     <p>MAPES , WALTER DE — A noted clerical wit of Henry the Second 's time .</p>
     <p>MOORE , THOMAS — The Irish poet ; born at Dublin in the year 1780 . Moore has been styled the best writer of political squibs that ever lived . He was employed to write comic verses on passing events , by the conductors of the “ London Times , ” in which journal many of his satirical poems appeared . The political effusions that gave so much delight thirty years ago are , however , scarcely intelligible to the present generation , or if intelligible , not interesting . But Moore wrote many a sprightly stanza , the humor of which does not depend for its effect upon local or cotemporary allusions . This collection contains most of them .</p>
     <p>MORRIS , GEORGE P — The father of polite journalism in this city , and the most celebrated of American Song-writers . Born in Pennsylvania about the beginning of the present century .</p>
     <p>“ PERCY RELIQUES ” — A celebrated collection of ancient ballads , edited by Bishop Percy , a man of great antiquarian knowledge and poetic taste . The publication of the “ Percy Reliques ” in the last century , introduced the taste for the antique , which was gratified to the utmost by Sir Walter Scott , and which has scarcely yet ceased to rage in some quarters .</p>
     <p>PHILIPS , BARCLAY — A living English writer , of whom nothing is known in this country .</p>

       <l n="3">London , 1688 ; died , 1744 .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>PRAED , WINTHROP MACKWORTH — An English poet , author of “ Lillian , ” born in London about the year 1800 . Little is known of Mr. Praed in this country , though it was here that his poems were first collected and published in a volume . His family is of the aristocracy of the city , where some of his surviving relations are still engaged in the business of banking . At Eton , Praed was highly distinguished for his literary talents . He was for some time the editor of “ The Etonian , ” a piquant periodical published by the students . From Eton he went to Cambridge , where he won an unprecedented number of prizes for poems and epigrams in Greek , Latin , and English . On returning to London , he was associated with Thomas Babbington Macaulay in the editorship of “ Knight 's Quarterly Magazine , ” after the discontinuance of which he occasionally contributed to the “ New Monthly . ” A few years before his death , Mr. Praed became a member of Parliament , but owing to his love of ease and society , obtained little distinction in that body .</p>
     <p>Mr. N. P. Willis thus writes of the poet as he appeared in society : “ We chance to have it in our power to say a word as to Mr. Praed 's personal appearance , manners , etc . It was our good fortune when first in England ( in 1834 or ‘ 35 ) , to be a guest at the same hospitable country-house for several weeks . The party there assembled was somewhat a femous one-Miss Jane Porter , Miss Julia Pardoe , Krazinski ( the Polish historian ) , Sir Gardiner Wilkinson ( the Oriental traveler ) , venerable Lady Cork ( ‘ Lady Bellair ’ of D'lsraeli ' s novel ) , and several persons more distinguished in society than in literature . Praed , we believe , had not been long married , but he was there with his wife . He was apparently about thirty-five , tall , and of dark complexion , with a studious bend in his shoulders , and of irregular features strongly impressed with melancholy . His manners were particularly reserved , though as unassuming as they could well be . His exquisitely beautiful poem of ‘ Lillian ’ was among the pet treasures of the lady of the house , and we had all been indulged with a sight of it , in a choicely bound manuscript copy — but it was hard to make him confess to any literary habits or standing . As a gentleman of ample means and retired life , the land of notice drawn upon him by the admiration of this poem , seemed distasteful . His habits were very secluded . We only saw him at table and in the evening ; and , for the rest of the day , he was away in the remote walks and woods of the extensive park around the mansion , apparently more fond of solitude than of anything else . Mr. Praed 's mind was one of wonderful readiness — rhythm and rhyme coming to him with the flow of an improvisatore . The ladies of the party made the events of every day the subjects of charades , epigrams , sonnets , etc ., with the design of suggesting inspiration to his ready pen ; and he was most brilliantly complying , with treasures for each in her turn . ”</p>
     <p>Mr. Praed died on the 15th of July , 1839 , without having accomplished any thing worthy the promise of his earlier years — another instance of Life 's reversing the judgment of College . As a writer of agreeable trifles for the amusement of the drawing-room , he has had few superiors , and it is said that a large number of his impromptu effusions are still in the possession of his friends unpublished . Two editions of his poems have appeared in New York , one by Langley in 1844 , and another by Redfield a few years later .</p>
     <p>PRIOR , MATTHEW — Born 1664 ; died 1721 . A wit and poet of no small genius and good nature — one of the minor celebrities of the days of Queen Anne . His “ Town and Country Mouse , ” written to ridicule of Dryden 's famous “ Hind and Panther , ” procured him the appointment of Secretary of Embassy at the Hague , and he subsequently rose to be ambassador at Paris . Suffering disgrace with his patrons he was afterward recalled , and received a pension from the University of Oxford , up to the time of his death .</p>
     <p>“ PUNCH ” — Commenced in July , 1841 , making its appearance just at the close of the Whig ministry , under Lord Melbourne , and the accession of the Tories , headed by Sir Robert Peel . Originated by a circle of wits and literary men who frequented the “ Shakspeare 's Head , ” a tavern in Wych-street , London . Mark Lemon , the landlord was , and still is , its editor . He is of Jewish descent , and had some reputation for ability with his pen , having been connected with other journals , and also written farces and dramatic pieces . Punch 's earliest contributors were Douglas Jerrold , Albert Smith , Gilbert Abbot a'Beckett Hood and Maginn - Thackeray 's debut occurring in the third volume . It is said that one evening each week was especially devoted to a festive meeting of these writers , where , Lernon presiding , they deliberated as to the conduct and course of the periodical . “ Punch , ” however , was at first not successful , and indeed on the point of being abandoned as a bad speculation , when Messrs. Bradbury and Evans , two aspiring printers , now extensive publishers , purchased it at the very moderate price of one hundred pounds , since which time it has continued their property , and a valuable one . In those days it presented a somewhat different appearance from the present , being more closely printed , finer type used , and the illustrations ( with the exception of small , black , silhouette cuts , after the style of those in similar French publications ) , were comparatively scanty . Soon , however , “ Punch ” throve apace , amply meriting its success . To Henning 's drawings ( mostly those of a political nature ) , were added those of Leech , Kenny Meadows , Phiz ( H. K. Browne ) , Gilbert , Alfred Crowquill ( Forrester ) , and others — Doyle 's pencil not appearing till some years later . Chief of these gentlemen in possession of the peculiar artistic ability which has identified itself with “ Punch ” is unquestionably Mr. John Leech , of whom we shall subsequently speak , at greater length . He has remained constant to the journal from its first volume . Jerrold 's writings date from the commencement . Many essays and satiric sketches over fancy signatures , are from his pen . His later and longer productions , extending through many volumes , are “ Punch 's Letters to his Son , ” “ Punch 's Complete Letter Writer , ” “ Twelve Labors of Hercules , ” “ Autobiography of Tom Thumb , ” “ Mrs. Caudle 's Curtain Lectures , ” “ Capsicum House for Young Ladies , ” “ Our Little Bird , ” “ Mrs. Benimble 's Tea and Toast , ” “ Miss Robinson Crusoe , ” and “ Mrs. Bib 's Baby , ” the last two of which were never completed . During the publication of the “ Caudle Lectures , ” “ Punch ” reached the highest circulation it has attained . We have the authority of a personal friend of the author for the assertion that their heroine was no fictitious one . The lectures were immensely popular , Englishmen not being slow to recognize in Jerold 's caustic portraiture the features of a very formidable household reality . But with the ladies Mrs. Caudle proved no favorite , nor , in their judgment , did the “ Breakfast-Table-Talk , ” of the Henpecked Husband ( subsequently published in the Almanac of the current year ) , make amends for the writer 's former productions . Albert Smith 's contributions to the pages of “ Punch , ” were the “ Physiologies of the London Medical Student , ” “ London Idler , ” and “ Evening Parties , ” with other miscellaneous matter . Much of the author 's own personal experience is probably comprised in the former , and his fellow-students and intimates at Middlesex Hospital were at no loss to identify the majority of the characters introduced . Mr. Smith 's connection with “ Punch ” was not of long continuance . A severe criticism appearing subsequently in its columns , on his novel of the “ Marchioness of Brinvilliers ” ( published in “ Bentley 's Miscellany , ” of which journal he was then editor ) , he , in retaliation , made an onslaught on “ Punch ” in another story , the “ Pottleton Legacy , ” where it figures under the title of the Cracker .</p>
     <p>Mr. Gilbert a'Beckett , who had before been engaged in many unsuccessful periodicals , found in “ Punch ” ample scope for his wit and extraordinary faculty of punning . In “ The Comic Blackstone , ” “ Political Dictionary , ” “ Punch 's Noy 's Maxims , ” and the “ Autobiography , and other papers relating to Mr. Briefless , ” he put his legal knowledge to a comic use . Many fugitive minor pieces have also proceeded from his pen , and he has but few equals in that grotesque form of hybrid poetry known as Macaronic . He is now a London magistrate , and PAR EXCELLENCE , the punster of “ Punch . ”</p>
     <p>The Greek versions of sundry popular ballads , such as “ The King of the Cannibal Islands , ” were the work of Maginn . Hood 's world-famous “ Song of the Shirt , ” first appeared in “ Punch 's ” pages .</p>
     <p>Thackeray has also been an industrious contributor , Commencing with “ Miss Tickletoby 's Lectures ” ( an idea afterward carried out in a somewhat different fashion by a'Beckett in his “ Comic History of England ” ) , he , besides miscellaneous writings , produced the “ Snob Papers , ” “ Jeames 's Diary , ” “ Punch in the East , ” “ Punch 's Prose Novelists , ” “ The Traveler in London , ” “ Mr. Brown 's Letters to a Young Man about Town , ” and “ The Proser . ” Of the merits of these works it is unnecessary to speak . The “ Book of Snobs ” may rank with its author 's most finished productions . “ Jeames 's Diary , ” suggested by the circumstance of a May-fair footman achieving sudden affluence by railroad speculations during the ruinously exciting period of 1846 , may , however , be considered only a further carrying out of the original idea of “ Charles Yellowplush . ” A ballad in it , “ The Lines to my Sister 's Portrait , ” is said , to use a vulgar , though expressive phrase , to have SHUT UP Lord John Manners , who had achieved some small reputation as “ one of the Young England poits . ” Thackeray parodied his style , and henceforth the voice of the minstrel was dumb in the land . Like Jerrold 's “ Caudle Lectures , ” of which many versions appeared at the London theaters , Jeames 's adventures were dramatized . The “ Prose Novelists ” contain burlesque imitations of Bulwer , D'Israeli , Lever , James , Fennimore Cooper , and Mrs. Gore . The illustrations accompanying Thackeray 's publications in “ Punch , ” are by his own hand , as are also many other sketches scattered throughout the volumes . They may be generally distinguished by the insertion of a pair of spectacles in the corner . His articles , too , frequently bear the signature “ SPEC . ” Not until the commencement of 1855 did Thackeray relinquish his connection with “ Punch . ” An allusion to this , from his pen , contained in an essay on the genius of Leech , and published in the “ Westminster Review , ” was commented upon very bitterly by Jerrold , in a notice of the article which appeared in “ Lloyd 's Weekly Newspaper , ” of which he is editor .</p>
     <p>During the last five years , other writers , among which may be enumerated the Mayhew brothers , Mr. Tom Taylor , Angus Reach , and Shirley Brooks , have found a field for their talents in “ Punch . ' Only Jerrold , a'Beckett , and the editor , Mark Lemon , remain of the original contributors . Its course has been a varied , but perfectly independent one , generally , however , following the lead of the almighty “ Times , ” that glory and shame of English journalism , on political questions . In earlier days it was every way more democratic , and the continuous ridicule both of pen and pencil directed against Prince Albert , was said to have provoked so much resentment on the part of the Queen , that she proposed interference to prevent the artist Doyle supplying two frescos to the pavilion at Buckingham Palace . “ Punch 's ” impartiality has been shown by attacks on the extremes and absurdities of all parties , and there can be little question that it has had considerable influence in producing political reform , and a large and liberal advocacy of all popular questions . In behalf of that great change of national policy , the repeal of the Corn Laws , “ Punch ” fought most vigorously , not , however , forgetting to bestow a few raps of his baton on the shoulders of the Premier whose wisdom or sense of expediency induced such sudden tergiversation as to bring it about . O'Connell ' s blatant and venal patriotism was held up to merited derision , which his less wary , but more honest followers in agitation , O'Brien , Meagher , and Mitchell , equally shared . Abolition ( or at least modification ) of the Game Laws , and of the penalty of death , found championship in “ Punch , ” though the latter was summarily dropped upon a change in public opinion , perhaps mainly induced by one of Carlyle 's “ Latter Day ” pamphlets . “ Punch ” has repeatedly experienced ( and merited ) the significant honor of being denied admission to the dominions of continental monarchs . Louis Philippe interdicted its presence in France , even ( if we recollect aright ) before the Spanish marriage had provoked its fiercest attacks — subsequently , however , withdrawing his royal veto . In Spain , Naples , the Papal Dominions , those of Austria , Russia , and Prussia , the hunch-backed jester has been often under ban as an unholy thing , or only tolerated in a mutilated form . Up to the commencement of the late war , strict measures of this kind were in operation upon the Russian frontier , but “ Punch ” now is freely accorded ingress in the Czar 's dominions — probably as a means of keeping up the feeling of antagonism toward England .</p>
     <p>Its success has provoked innumerable rivals and imitators , from the days of “ Judy , ” “ Toby , ” “ The Squib , ” “ Joe Miller , ” “ Great Gun , ” and “ Puppet-Show , ” to those of “ Diogenes ” and ” “ Falstaff . ” None haveachieved permanent popularity , and future attempts would most likely be attended with similar failure , as “ Punch ” has a firm hold on the likings of the English people , and especially Londoners . It fairly amounts to one of their institutions . Like all journals of merit and independence , it has had its law troubles , more than one action for libel having been commenced against it . James Silk Buckingham , the traveler and author , took this course , in consequence of the publication of articles disparaging a club of his originating , known as the “ British and Foreign Institute . ” A Jew clothes-man , named Hart , obtained a small sum as damages from “ Punch . ” But Alfred Bunn , lessee of Drury Lane Theater , libretto-scribbler , and author of certain trashy theatrical books , though most vehemently “ pitched into , ” resorted to other modes than legal redress . He produced a pamphlet of a shape and appearance closely resembling his tormentor , filled not only with quizzical , satirical , and rhyming articles directed against Lemon , a'Beckett , and Jerrold ( characterizing them as Thick-head , Sleek-head , and Wrong-head ) , but with caricature cuts of each . Whether in direct consequence or not , it is certain that “ the poet Bunn ” was unmolested in future .</p>
     <p>Our notice would scarcely be complete without a few lines devoted to the “ Punch ” artists , and more especially John Leech . Doyle ( the son of H. B ., the well-known political caricaturist ) , whose exquisite burlesque medieval drawings illustrative of the “ Manners and Customs of ye Englishe , ” will be remembered by all familiar with “ Punch 's ” pages , relinquished his connection with the journal and the yearly salary of eight hundred pounds , in consequence of the Anti-papal onslaughts which followed the nomination of Cardinal Wiseman to the ( Catholic ) Archbishop of Westminster . The artist held the older faith , and was also a personal friend of “ His Eminence . ” His place was then filled by John Tenniel , a historical painter , who had supplied a cartoon to the Palace of Westminster , and is still employed on “ Punch , ” he , in conjunction with John Leech , and an occasional outsider , furnishing the entire illustrations . John Leech , himself , to whom the periodical unquestionably owes half its success , has been constant to “ Punch ” from an early day . He has brought caricature into the region of the fine arts , and become the very Dickens of the pencil in his portrayal of the humorous side of life . Before his advent , comic drawing was confined to very limited topics , OUTRE drawings and ugliness of features forming the fun — such as it was . Seymour 's “ Cockney Sportsmen , ” and Cruikshank 's wider ( yet not extensive ) range of subjects , were then the best things extant . How stands the case now ? Let “ Punch 's ” twenty-nine volumes , with their ample store of pictorial mirth of Leech 's creating , so kindly , so honest , so pleasant and graceful , answer . Contrast their blameless wit and humor with the equivoque and foul double entendre of French drawings , and think of the difference involuntarily suggested between the social atmospheres of Paris and London .</p>
     <p>Leech is a good-looking fellow , approaching the age of forty , and not unlike one of his own handsome “ swells ” in personal appearance . The Royal Academy Exhibition of 1855 contained his portrait , painted by Millais , the chief of the pre-Raphaelite artists , who is said to be his friend . As may be gathered from his many sporting sketches , Leech is fond of horses , and piques himself on “ knowing the points ” of a good animal . ( We may mention , by-the-by , that Mr. “ Briggs ” of equestrian celebrity had his original on the Stock Exchange . ) He in summer travels considerably , forwarding his sketches to the “ Punch ” office , generally penciling the accompanying words on the wood-block . In one of the past volumes , dating some eight or ten years back , he has introduced himself in a cut designated “ our artist during the hot weather , ” wherein he appears with his coat off , reclining upon a sofa , and informing a pretty servant-girl who enters the room , that “ he is busy . ” Quizzical Portraits of the writers of “ Punch ” have been introduced in its pages . In Jerrold 's “ Capsicum House ” ( vol . XII . ) , the author 's portrait , burlesqued into the figure of “ Punch , ” occurs more than once . And a double-page cut , entitled “ Mr. Punch 's Fancy Ball , ” in the early part of the same volume , comprises sketches of the then entire corps of contributors , artistic and literary . They are drawn as forming the orchestra , Lemon conducting , Jerrold belaboring a big drum , Thackeray playing on the flute , Leech the violin , and others extracting harmony from divers musical instruments . Again they appear at a later date , as a number of boys at play , in an illustration at the commencement of Vol . XXVII .</p>
     <p>“ Punch 's ” office is at 85 Fleet-street . The engraving , printing , and stereotyping is performed at Lombard-street , Whitefriars , where its proprietors have extensive premises .</p>
     <p>REJECTED ADDRESSES , by James and Horace Smith , published in London , October , 1812 . The most successful jeu d'esprit of modern times , having survived the occasion that suggested it for nearly half a century , and still being highly popular . It has run through twenty editions in England , and three in America . The opening of Drury-lane theater in 1802 , after having been burned and rebuilt , and the offering of a prize of fifty pounds by the manager for the best opening address , were the circumstances which suggested the production of the “ Rejected Addresses . ” The idea of the work was suddenly conceived , and it was executed in six weeks . In the preface to the eighteenth London edition the authors give an interesting statement of the difficulties they encountered in getting the volume published :</p>
     <p>“ Urged forward by our hurry , and trusting to chance , two very bad coadjutors in any enterprise , we at length congratulated ourselves on having completed our task in time to have it printed and published by the opening of the theater . But , alas ! our difficulties , so far from being surmounted , seemed only to be beginning . Strangers to the arcana of the bookseller 's trade , and unacquainted with their almost invincible objection to single volumes of low price , especially when tendered by writers who have acquired no previous name , we little anticipated that they would refuse to publish our ‘ Rejected Addresses , ’ even although we asked nothing for the copyright . Such , however , proved to be the case . Our manuscript was perused and returned to us by several of the most eminent publishers . Well do we remember betaking ourselves to one of the craft in Bond-street , whom we found in a back parlor , with his gouty leg propped upon a cushion , in spite of which warning he diluted his luncheon with frequent glasses of Madeira . ‘ What have you already written ? ’ was his first question , and interrogatory to which we had been subjected in almost every instance . ‘ Nothing by which we can be known . ’ ‘ Then I am afraid to undertake the publication . ’ We presumed timidly to suggest that every writer must have a beginning , and that to refuse to publish for him until he had acquired a name , was to imitate the sapient mother who cautioned her son against going into the water until he could swim . ‘ An old joke — a regular Joe ! ’ exclaimed our companion , tossing off another bumper . ‘ Still older than Joe Miller , ’ was our reply ; ‘ for , if we mistake not , it is the very first anecdote in the facetiae of Hierocles . ’ ‘ Ha , sirs ! ’ resumed the bibliopolist , ‘ you are learned , are you ? do , hoh !— Well , leave your manuscript with me ; I will look it over to-night , and give you an answer to-morrow . ’ Punctual as the clock we presented ourselves at his door on the following morning when our papers were returned to us with the observation — ‘ These trifles are really not deficient in smartness ; they are well , vastly well for beginners ; but they will never do — never . They would not pay for advertising , and without it I should not sell fifty copies . ’</p>
     <p>“ This was discouraging enough . If the most experienced publishers feared to be out of pocket by the work , it was manifest D FORTIORI , that its writers ran a risk of being still more heavy losers , should they undertake the publication on their own account . We had no objection to raise a laugh at the expense of others ; but to do it at our own cost , uncertain as we were to what extent we might be involved , had never entered into our contemplation . In this dilemma , our ‘ Addresses , ’ now in every sense rejected , might probably have never seen the light , had not some good angel whispered us to betake ourselves to Mr. John Miller , a dramatic publisher , then residing in Bow-street , Covent Garden . No sooner had this gentleman looked over our manuscript , than he immediately offered to take upon himself all the risk of publication , and to give us half the profits , SHOULD THERE BE ANY ; a liberal proposition , with which we gladly closed . So rapid and decided was its success , at which none were more unfeignedly astonished than its authors , that Mr. Miller advised us to collect some ‘ Imitations of Horace , ’ which had appeared anonymously in the ‘ Monthly Mirror , ’ offering to publish them upon the same terms . We did so accordingly ; and as new editions of the ‘ Rejected Addresses ’ were called for in quick succession , we were shortly enabled to sell our half copyright in the two works to Mr. Miller , for one thousand pounds ! We have entered into this unimportant detail , not to gratify any vanity of our own , but to encourage such literary beginners as may be placed in similar circumstances ; as well as to impress upon publishers the propriety of giving more consideration to the possible merit of the works submitted to them , than to the mere magic of a name . ”</p>
     <p>The authors add , that not one of the poets whom they “ audaciously burlesqued , ” took offense at the ludicrous imitation of their style . From “ Sir Walter Scott , ” they observe , “ we received favors and notice , both public and private , which it will be difficult to forget , because we had not the smallest claim upon his kindness . ‘ I certainly must have written this myself ! ’ said that fine tempered man to one of the authors , pointing to the description of the Fire , ‘ although I forgot upon what occasion . ’ Lydia White , a literary lady , who was prone to feed the lions of the day , invited one of us to dinner ; but , recollecting afterward that William Spencer formed one of the party , wrote to the latter to put him off ; telling him that a man was to be at her table whom he ‘ would not like to meet . ’ ‘ Pray who is this whom I should not like to meet ? ’ inquired the poet ‘ O ! ’ answered the lady , ‘ one of those men who have made that shameful attack upon you ! ’ ‘ The very man upon earth . I should like to know ! ’ rejoined the lively and careless bard . The two individuals accordingly met , and have continued fast friends over since . Lord Byron , too , wrote thus to Mr. Murray from Italy : ‘ Tell him we forgive him , were he twenty times our satirist . ’</p>
     <p>“ It may not be amiss to notice , in this place , one criticism of a Leicester clergyman , which may be pronounced unique : ‘ I do not see why they should have been rejected , ’ observed the matter-of-fact annotator ; ‘ I think some of them very good ! ’ Upon the whole , few have been the instances , in the acrimonious history of literature , where a malicious pleasantry like the ‘ Rejected Addresses ’ — which the parties ridiculed might well consider more annoying than a direct satire — instead of being met by querulous bitterness or petulant retaliation , has procured for its authors the acquaintance , or conciliated the good-will , of those whom they had the most audaciously burlesqued . ”</p>
     <p>James Smith died in London on the 29th of December , 1836 , in the sixty-fourth year of his age . His brother survived him many years . Both were admired and ever-welcome members of the best society of London .</p>
     <p>ROGERS , SAMUEL — The English poet and banker , recently deceased . Author of a “ pretty poem , ” entitled , “ The Pleasures of Memory . ” In his old age , he was noted for the bitter wit of his conversation .</p>
     <p>SAXE , JOHN G — Editor of the “ Burlington Gazette , ” and “ Wandering Minstrel . ” The witty poems of Mr. Saxe are somewhat in the manner of Hood . To be fully appreciated they must be heard , as they roll in sonorous volumes , from his own lips . His collected poems were published a few years ago by Ticknor &amp; Fields , and have already reached a ninth edition .</p>
     <p>SCOTT , SIR WALTER — Born 1771 ; died , 1832 . Sir Walter Scott , though he excelled all his cotemporaries in the humorous delineation of character , wrote little humorous verse . The two pieces published in this volume are so excellent that one is surprised to find no more of the same description in his writings .</p>
     <p>SHERIDAN , DR. THOMAS — Noted for being an intimate friend of Dean Swift , and the grandfather of Richard Brinsley Sheridan . Born in 1684 ; died in 1738 . He was an eccentric , witty , somewhat learned , Dublin schoolmaster . He published some sermons and a translation of Persius ; acquired great celebrity as a teacher ; but through the imprudence that distinguished the family , closed his life in poverty . We may infer from the few specimens of his facetious writings that have been preserved that he was one of the wittiest of a nation of wits . One or two of his epigrams are exquisitely fine .</p>
     <p>SHERIDAN , RICHARD BRINSLEY — Author of the “ Rivals , ” and the “ School for Scandal . ” Born at Dublin in 1751 ; died , 1816 . Sheridan must have written more humorous poetry than we have been able to discover . It is probable that most of his epigrams and verified repartees have either not been preserved , or have escaped our search . Moore , in his “ Life of Sheridan , ” gives specimens of his satirical verses , but only a few , and but one of striking excellence .</p>
     <p>SMITH , HORACE — See “ Rejected Addresses . ”</p>
     <p>SMITH , JAMES — See “ Rejected Addresses . ”</p>
     <p>SMITH , REV . SYDNEY — The jovial prebendary of St. Paul 's , the wittiest Englishman that ever lived ; died in 1845 . Except the “ Recipe for Salad , ” and an epigram , we have found no comic verses by him . He “ leaked another way . ”</p>
     <p>SOUTHEY , ROBERT — The English poet and man of letters ; born in 1774 . Southey wrote a great deal of humorous verse , much of which is ingenious and fluent . He was amazingly dexterous in the use of words , and excelled all his cotemporaries , except Byron and Barham , in the art of rhyming .</p>
     <p>SWIFT , JONATHAN — Dean of St. Patrick 's . Dublin . Born 1667 ; died , 1739 . It were superfluous to speak of the career or abilities of this great but most unhappy man , who unquestionably ranks highest amid the brilliant names of that brilliant epoch . His works speak for him , and will to all time . Of his poetical writings it may be said that though only surpassed in wit and humor by his more universally known prose , they are infinitely NASTIER than any thing else in the English language . They have , however , the negative virtue of being nowise licentious or demoralizing — or at least no more so than is inseparable from the choice of obscene and repulsive subjects . Nearly all his unobjectionable comic verses may be found in this volume .</p>
     <p>THACKERAY , WILLIAM MAKEPEACE — The greatest of living satirists . Born at Calcutta of English parents , in 1811 . Most of Mr. Thackeray 's comic verses appeared originally in “ Punch ” They have recently been collected and published in a volume with other and more serious pieces . This collection contains nothing more mirth-provoking than the “ Ballads of Pleaceman X , ” by Mr. Thackeray .</p>

     <p>WALLER , EDMUND — Born in Warwickshire , England , in 1608 . Poet , man of fortune , member of the Long Parliament , and traitor to the People 's Cause . He was fined ten thousand pounds and banished , but Cromwell permitted his return , and the poet rewarded his clemency by a panegyric .</p>
     <p>WESLEY , REV . SAMUEL — A clergyman of the Church of England ; father of the celebrated John Wesley ; author of a volume of poems , entitled “ Maggots ; ” born in 1662 ; died in 1785 .</p>
     <p>WILLIAMS , SIR CHARLES HANBURY — A noted wit of George the Second 's time ; born in 1709 ; died , 1759 . He was a friend of Walpole , sat in parliament for Monmouth , and rose to some distinction in the diplomatic service . An edition of his writings in three volumes was published in London in 1822 . Time has robbed his satires of their point , by burying in oblivion the circumstances that gave rise to them . A single specimen of his writings is all that was deemed worthy of place in this volume .</p>
     <p>WILLIS , N. P .— The well-known American poet and journalist , Mr. Willis has written many humorous poems , but only a few have escaped the usual fate of newspaper verses . Born at Portland , Maine , 1807 .</p>
     <p>WOLCOTT , JOHN ( Peter Pindar ) , the most voluminous , and one of the best of the humorous poets who have written in the English language . He was born in Devonshire , England , and flourished in the reign of George III , whose peculiarities it was his delight to ridicule . No king was ever so mercilessly and so successfully lampooned by a poet as George III by Peter Pindar . Wolcott was by profession a Doctor of Medicine . In 1766 , we find him accompanying his relative , Sir William Trelawney , to Jamaica , of which island Sir William had been appointed governor . While there , the rector of a valuable living died , and Dr. Wolcott conceived the idea of entering the church and applying for the vacant rectorship . To this end he began actually to perform the duties of the parish , reading prayers and preaching , and soon after returned to England to take orders , provideed with powerful recommendations . To his great disappointment , the Bishop of London refused him ordination , and the reader of Peter Pindar will not be at a loss to guess the reason of the refusal . Wolcott now established himself in Truro , and continued in the successful practice of medicine there for several years .</p>
     <p>At Truro , he met the youthful Opie . “ It is much to his honor , ” says one who wrote in Wolcott 's own lifetime , “ that during his residence in Cornwall , he discovered , and encouraged , the fine talents of the late Opie , the artist ; a man of such modesty , simplicity of manners , and ignorance of the world , that it is probable his genius would have lain obscure and useless , had he not met , in Dr. Wolcott , with a judicious friend , who knew how to appreciate his worth , and to recommend it tothe admiration of the world . The Doctor 's taste in painting has already been noticed ; and it may now be added , that perhaps few men have attained more correct notions on the subject , and the fluency with which he expatiates on the beauties or defects of the productions of the ancient or modern school , has been amply acknowledged by all who have shared in his company . The same taste appears to have directed him to some of the first subjects of his poetical satire , when he began to treat the public with the pieces which compose these volumes . The effect of these poems on the public mind will not be soon forgot . Here appeared a new poet and a new critic , a man of unquestionable taste and luxuriant fancy , combined with such powers of satire , as became tremendously formidable to all who had the misfortune to fall under his displeasure . It was acknowledged at the same time , that amid some personal acrimony , and some affectionate preferences , not far removed , perhaps , from downright prejudice , he in general grounded his praise and censure upon solid principles , and carried the public mind along with him , although sometimes at the heavy expense of individuals . ”</p>
     <p>Later in life Dr. Wolcott removed to London , where he died at an advanced age . His writings were , as may be supposed , eagerly read at the time of their publication , but since the poet 's death , they have scarcely received the attention which their merits deserve . The present collection contains all of his best poems which are not of a character too local and cotemporary , or too coarse in expression , to be enjoyed by the modern reader .</p>
     <p>YRIARTE , DON TOMAS DE — An eminent Spanish poet , born at Teneriffe about 1760 . He is known to English readers chiefly through his “ Literary Fables , ” of which , specimens , translated by Mr. Devereaux , are given in this volume , Yriarte also wrote comedies and essays .</p>
