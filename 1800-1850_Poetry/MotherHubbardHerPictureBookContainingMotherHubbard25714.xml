    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">MOTHER HUBBARD , as we all know , had a cupboard which she found bare on one occasion .</p>
    <p n="2">Well , this is Mother Hubbard 's Picture Book , and it 's rather bearish , too , for there are no less than THREE BEARS therein .</p>
    <p n="3">But you must not suppose that the book is altogether bear , because there are other things in it .</p>
    <p n="4">There 's Apple pie , for instance to my certain knowledge , and “ victuals and drink ” of sorts , as well — but I must not let the cat out of the bag ( or the cupboard ) all at once — besides Mother Hubbard 's clever dog is still feeding it , for his day ( in spite of muzzles ) is not over yet , and he is up to all his old tricks .</p>
    <p n="5">When you are tired of him , and if you can manage to get past the Three Bears , you will find the rest as ABSURDly easy as A. B. C . and probably meet many old friends on the way .</p>

     <l n="11">Some time ago , ere we were born or thought of ,</l>
     <l n="12">There lived a little girl , who liked to roam</l>
     <l n="13">Through lonely woods and lanes , unknown , unsought of</l>
     <l n="14">Such folk who like to stop and stay at home .</l>
     <l n="15">She found out curious things in all her travel</l>
     <l n="16">And one of her adventures I will tell :</l>
     <l n="17">Once , in a wood she saw a path of gravel ,</l>
     <l n="18">Which led to a small cottage in a dell .</l>

     <l n="19">[ Illustration ]</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="20">And , as the door stood open , in walked boldly ,</l>
     <l n="21">This child , whose name was Silverlocks , I 'm told ;</l>
     <l n="22">There was nobody there to treat her coldly ,</l>
     <l n="23">No friend to call her back , no nurse to scold .</l>
     <l n="24">She found herself within a parlour charming ;</l>
     <l n="25">And there upon the table there were placed</l>
     <l n="26">Three basins , sending up a smell so warming ,</l>
     <l n="27">That she at once felt hungry , and must taste .</l>
     <l n="28">The largest basin first , but hot and biting</l>
     <l n="29">The soup was in it , and the second too ;</l>
     <l n="30">The smallest basin tasted so inviting ,</l>
     <l n="31">That up she ate it all , with small ado .</l>

     <l n="32">[ Illustration ]</l>

     <l n="33">And next she saw three chairs , and tried to sit in</l>
     <l n="34">The biggest , but it was too hard and high ;</l>
     <l n="35">The middle one she scarcely seemed to fit in ,</l>
     <l n="36">But in the smallest chair sat easily ;</l>
     <l n="37">And rocked herself , her ease and comfort taking ,</l>
     <l n="38">Singing the pretty songs she knew so well ;</l>
     <l n="39">When , oh ! the little chair cracked loud , and , breaking ,</l>
     <l n="40">Gave way all suddenly , and down she fell .</l>

     <l n="44">And so there were ; she said aloud , “ I 'll try one ,</l>

     <l n="46">The biggest bed was not of feathers , surely ,</l>
     <l n="47">It was so hard ; and so she tried the next ,</l>

     <l n="49">She slept upon the smallest one , unvext .</l>
     <l n="50">The little house belonged to bears , not persons ;</l>
