    <p>A TALE FROM THE CORNISH</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="40">In Lavan ’ s parish once of yore ,</l>
     <l n="41">Dwelt on the spot called Tshei an Hor ,</l>
     <l n="42">A loving couple , man and wife ,</l>
     <l n="43">But poverty distressed their life .</l>
     <l n="44">And thus the man his wife address ’ d :</l>
     <l n="45">“ I ’ ll wander forth of work in quest ;</l>
     <l n="46">And you , my dearest , you can earn</l>
     <l n="47">Your living here till I return .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="48">His home he leaves , and , far from gay ,</l>
     <l n="49">Towards the East he took his way .</l>
     <l n="50">At length a farmer ’ s dwelling reaching ,</l>
     <l n="51">He enter ’ d it , for work beseeching .</l>
     <l n="52">“ What work canst do ?” the farmer cried ;</l>
     <l n="53">“ All kinds of work , Sir ,” John replied .</l>
     <l n="54">Then straight they for a year agree ,</l>
     <l n="55">Three pounds the wages were to be .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="56">And when the year to end had come</l>
     <l n="57">The master paid him down the sum .</l>
     <l n="58">“ John ,” said his master , “ here ’ s your fee ;</l>
     <l n="59">But if you ’ ll it return to me ,</l>
     <l n="60">A point of wisdom I will teach you .”</l>
     <l n="61">Said John : “ Give it me , I beseech you .”</l>
     <l n="62">“ No , no , to give is not my way .”</l>
     <l n="63">“ Take it ,” said John , “ and say your say .”</l>
     <l n="64">Quoth t ’ other : “ This in memory hold :</l>
     <l n="65">Ne ’ er for the new road leave the old .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="66">They for another year agree ,</l>
     <l n="67">The wages just the same to be ;</l>
     <l n="68">And when the year its end had reached ,</l>
     <l n="69">The farmer forth the three pounds fetched .</l>
     <l n="70">“ John ,” said his master , “ here ’ s your fee ,</l>
     <l n="71">But if you ’ ll it return to me ,</l>
     <l n="72">A point of wisdom I will teach you .”</l>
     <l n="73">“ Give it me , Sir , I do beseech you .”</l>
     <l n="74">“ For nought I will not speak , not I .”</l>
     <l n="75">“ Well , take it then ,” was John ’ s reply .</l>
     <l n="76">Quoth t ’ other : “ Lodge not , for your life ,</l>
     <l n="77">With an old man who ’ s a young wife .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="78">For yet a year they then agree ,</l>
     <l n="79">The wages still the same to be .</l>
     <l n="80">And when the year to end had roll ’ d ,</l>
     <l n="81">The three pounds out the master told .</l>
     <l n="82">“ John ,” said the master , “ here ’ s your fee ;</l>
     <l n="83">But if you ’ ll it return to me ,</l>
     <l n="84">I ’ ll the best point of wisdom learn you .”</l>
     <l n="85">“ For that , Sir , I ’ ll the wage return you .”</l>
     <l n="86">The farmer said : “ Take this advice ,</l>
     <l n="87">Ere striking once , bethink thee twice .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="88">Now John would serve no longer there ,</l>
     <l n="89">Home to his wife he would repair .</l>
     <l n="90">“ Go not to-day ,” the farmer spake ,</l>
     <l n="91">“ To-morrow ’ s my wife ’ s day to bake ;</l>
     <l n="92">She shall for you prepare a cake</l>
     <l n="93">Home to your faithful wife to take .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="94">The nine pounds in the loaf they hid ,</l>
     <l n="95">And when John them adieu had bid ,</l>
     <l n="96">The farmer cried : “ I pray thee carry</l>
     <l n="97">This present home unto your deary ;</l>
     <l n="98">And as ye two there merry make ,</l>
     <l n="99">Then , and not till then , part the cake .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="100">John turned him homeward from the door ;</l>
     <l n="101">And when he reach ’ d St. Eler ’ s Moor ,</l>
     <l n="102">He met three Tre-ryn merchants there</l>
     <l n="103">Returning home from Exeter .</l>
     <l n="104">“ We ’ re glad to see thee , John ,” they cried ,</l>
     <l n="105">“ Where hast thou been this long , long tide ?”</l>
     <l n="106">Says John : “ I ’ m just from service come ,</l>
     <l n="107">And to my wife am journeying home .”</l>
     <l n="108">“ O travel with us ,” cried all three ,</l>
     <l n="109">“ And very welcome shalt thou be .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="110">Before them two roads they behold ;</l>
     <l n="111">They took the new , John kept the old .</l>
     <l n="112">And as they passed by Keou Tshoy Un ,</l>
     <l n="113">When they had just lost sight of John ,</l>
     <l n="114">Thieves set upon them furiously ,</l>
     <l n="115">Whereat they raised a doleful cry ,</l>
     <l n="116">Which reaching John ’ s ears on his rout ,</l>
     <l n="117">“ Murder !” and “ Thieves !” he bellowed out .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="118">His clamour scared the robber train ,</l>
     <l n="119">Who from the merchants sped amain .</l>
     <l n="120">And when they came to Market Jew</l>
     <l n="121">They to their joy met John anew ,</l>
     <l n="122">And cried : “ What thanks we owe thee , John !</l>
     <l n="123">We had for certain , every one ,</l>
     <l n="124">Been ruined people , but for thee ,</l>
     <l n="125">Come with us , thou ’ lt most welcome be .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="126">And when they reached the hostelrie</l>
     <l n="127">At which it was their wont to lie ,</l>
     <l n="128">Quoth John : “ The master I must view .”</l>
     <l n="129">“ The master ! what with him wouldst do ?”</l>
     <l n="130">They answered , “ we ’ ve a mistress here ,</l>
     <l n="131">And young enough she is , and fair ;</l>
     <l n="132">To see the host , if you ’ re inclined ,</l>
     <l n="133">Him in the kitchen you will find .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="134">Into the kitchen John he goes ,</l>
     <l n="135">And sees the master of the house ,</l>
     <l n="136">An ancient man who turned the spit .</l>
     <l n="137">“ O , ho !” said John , “ this house I quit ;</l>
     <l n="138">No sleeping place of it I ’ ll make ,</l>
     <l n="139">But in the next will quarters take .”</l>
     <l n="140">“ Do not go yet ,” they cried all three ,</l>
     <l n="141">“ Stay , sup with us , thou ’ lt welcome be .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="142">And now , with grief and shame , I say</l>
     <l n="143">That with a friar of orders grey</l>
     <l n="144">The mistress had contrived a plan</l>
     <l n="145">To murder the poor ancient man ,</l>
     <l n="146">When sleep had bound the merchants fast ,</l>
     <l n="147">And on their heads the crime to cast .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="33">
     <l n="148">John in the next house that same night</l>
     <l n="149">Saw through a hole i ’ the wall a light .</l>
     <l n="150">So getting up and gently walking ,</l>
     <l n="151">He heard the friar and woman talking .</l>
     <l n="152">The friar said : “ Against yon hole</l>
     <l n="153">My back I ’ ll set , for fear some soul</l>
     <l n="154">From the next house our deeds should spy .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="34">
     <l n="155">The hostess then most cruelly ,</l>
     <l n="156">With a silk handkerchief she bore ,</l>
     <l n="157">Murdered her ancient husband poor ,</l>
     <l n="158">Strangled him did the accursed slut .</l>
     <l n="159">But meanwhile through the hole John cut</l>
     <l n="160">A round piece from the friar ’ s gown ,</l>
     <l n="161">And then in bed again lay down .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="35">
     <l n="162">At morn ran out the hostess crying</l>
     <l n="163">That murdered was her husband lying ;</l>
     <l n="164">And since nor man nor child had been ,</l>
     <l n="165">Except the merchants , in the inn ,</l>
     <l n="166">They should be hanged withouten fail ;</l>
     <l n="167">They thereupon were led to jail .</l>
     <l n="168">John quickly them a visit paid .</l>
     <l n="169">“ O , John ! we ’ ve evil luck ,” they said ;</l>
     <l n="170">“ Last night the host was choked in bed ,</l>
     <l n="171">And upon us the crime is laid .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="36">
     <l n="172">“ Dear gentlemen ,” was John ’ s reply ,</l>
     <l n="173">“ Beseech the Justice instantly</l>
     <l n="174">To cause them who the murder wrought</l>
     <l n="175">Into his presence to be brought .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="37">
     <l n="176">“ But who knows who the deed has done ?”</l>
     <l n="177">They faltered forth ; then answered John :</l>
     <l n="178">“ If I can ’ t prove who did it , I</l>
     <l n="179">Will hang for it most willingly .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="38">
     <l n="180">“ Speak out ,” they cried . Said John : “ Last night ,</l>
     <l n="181">Being in bed , I saw a light ;</l>
     <l n="182">I rose , as if I ’ d had a call —</l>
     <l n="183">There was a hole in the house wall ,</l>
     <l n="184">’ Gainst which his back a certain friar</l>
     <l n="185">Placed , thereby blinding it entire ,</l>
     <l n="186">Lest , as he said , some curious eye</l>
     <l n="187">From the next house their deeds should spy .</l>
     <l n="188">I cut , meanwhile , to him unknown ,</l>
     <l n="189">A large round piece from off his gown .</l>
     <l n="190">To prove that what I ’ ve said is true</l>
     <l n="191">I ’ ve in my pouch the piece to shew .”</l>
     <l n="192">The merchants then were soon set free ;</l>
     <l n="193">The murderers died on gallows tree .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="39">
     <l n="194">All three depart from Market Jew ,</l>
     <l n="195">Together with their comrade true ,</l>
     <l n="196">Far as Kuz carn na Huila went ,</l>
     <l n="197">And thence their ways lay different .</l>
     <l n="198">Now though the merchants earnest were</l>
     <l n="199">That John should with them home repair ,</l>
     <l n="200">He steadfastly refused their plea ,</l>
     <l n="201">Longing his wife and home to see .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="40">
     <l n="202">When of the merchants he lost sight</l>
     <l n="203">He lounged away his time till night .</l>

     <l n="205">Abroad , his consort faithful proved .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="41">
     <l n="206">Arrived , he listened at the door ,</l>

     <l n="208">Within the bed ; his knife he drew ,</l>
     <l n="209">Resolved to slay the guilty two .</l>
     <l n="210">But soon remembering the advice ,</l>
     <l n="211">“ Ere striking once , bethink thee twice ,”</l>
     <l n="212">In hurry from the door he strode ,</l>
     <l n="213">But soon returning knocked aloud .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="42">
     <l n="214">“ In name of God , who ’ s there ?” she cried ;</l>
