       <l n="2">It was the schooner Hesperus ,</l>
       <l n="3">That sailed the wintry sea ;</l>
       <l n="4">And the skipper had taken his little daughter ,</l>
       <l n="5">To bear him company .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="6">Blue were her eyes as the fairy-flax ,</l>
       <l n="7">Her cheeks like the dawn of day ,</l>
       <l n="8">And her bosom white as the hawthorn buds ,</l>
       <l n="9">That ope in the month of May .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="10">The skipper he stood beside the helm ,</l>
       <l n="11">His pipe was in his mouth ,</l>
       <l n="12">And he watched how the veering flaw did blow</l>
       <l n="13">The smoke now West , now South .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="14">Then up and spake an old Sailor ,</l>
       <l n="15">Had sailed to the Spanish Main ,</l>
       <l n="16">“ I pray thee , put into yonder port ,</l>
       <l n="17">For I fear a hurricane .</l>

       <l n="19">And to-night no moon we see ! ”</l>
       <l n="20">The skipper , he blew a whiff from his pipe ,</l>
       <l n="21">And a scornful laugh laughed he .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="22">Colder and louder blew the wind ,</l>
       <l n="23">A gale from the Northeast ,</l>
       <l n="24">The snow fell hissing in the brine ,</l>
       <l n="25">And the billows frothed like yeast .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="26">Down came the storm , and smote amain</l>
       <l n="27">The vessel in its strength ;</l>
       <l n="28">She shuddered and paused , like a frighted steed ,</l>
       <l n="29">Then leaped her cable 's length .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="30">“ Come hither ! come hither ! my little daughter ,</l>
       <l n="31">And do not tremble so ;</l>
       <l n="32">For I can weather the roughest gale</l>
       <l n="33">That ever wind did blow . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="34">He wrapped her warm in his seaman 's coat</l>
       <l n="35">Against the stinging blast ;</l>
       <l n="36">He cut a rope from a broken spar ,</l>
       <l n="37">And bound her to the mast .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="38">“ O father ! I hear the church-bells ring ,</l>

       <l n="40">“ ‘ T is a fog-bell on a rock-bound coast ! ” —</l>
       <l n="41">And he steered for the open sea .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="42">“ O father ! I hear the sound of guns ,</l>
       <l n="43">Oh say , what may it be ? ”</l>

       <l n="47">Oh say , what may it be ? ”</l>
       <l n="48">But the father answered never a word ,</l>
       <l n="49">A frozen corpse was he .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="50">Lashed to the helm , all stiff and stark ,</l>
       <l n="51">With his face turned to the skies ,</l>
       <l n="52">The lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow</l>
       <l n="53">On his fixed and glassy eyes .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="54">Then the maiden clasped her hands and prayed</l>
       <l n="55">That saved she might be ;</l>
       <l n="56">And she thought of Christ , who stilled the wave ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="17">
       <l n="62">And ever the fitful gusts between</l>

       <l n="64">It was the sound of the trampling surf</l>
       <l n="65">On the rocks and the hard sea-sand .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="18">
       <l n="66">The breakers were right beneath her bows ,</l>
       <l n="67">She drifted a dreary wreck ,</l>

       <l n="70">She struck where the white and fleecy waves</l>

       <l n="74">Her rattling shrouds , all sheathed in ice ,</l>

        <l n="1">In the Acadian land , on the shores of the Basin of Minas ,</l>
        <l n="2">Distant , secluded , still , the little village of Grand-Pre</l>
        <l n="3">Lay in the fruitful valley . Vast meadows stretched to the eastward ,</l>
        <l n="4">Giving the village its name , and pasture to flocks without number .</l>
        <l n="5">Dikes , that the hands of the farmers had raised with labor incessant ,</l>
        <l n="6">Shut out the turbulent tides ; but at stated seasons the flood-gates</l>
        <l n="7">Opened , and welcomed the sea to wander at will o'er the meadows .</l>
        <l n="8">West and south there were fields of flax , and orchards and cornfields</l>
        <l n="9">Spreading afar and unfenced o'er the plain ; and away to the northward</l>
        <l n="10">Blomidon rose , and the forests old , and aloft on the mountains</l>
        <l n="11">Sea-fogs pitched their tents , and mists from the mighty Atlantic</l>
        <l n="12">Looked on the happy valley , but ne'er from their station descended .</l>
        <l n="13">There , in the midst of its farms , reposed the Acadian village .</l>
        <l n="14">Strongly built were the houses , with frames of oak and of hemlock ,</l>
        <l n="15">Such as the peasants of Normandy built in the reign of the Henries .</l>
        <l n="16">Thatched were the roofs , with dormer-windows ; and gables projecting</l>
        <l n="17">Over the basement below protected and shaded the doorway .</l>
        <l n="18">There in the tranquil evenings of summer , when brightly the sunset</l>
        <l n="19">Lighted the village street , and gilded the vanes on the chimneys ,</l>
        <l n="20">Matrons and maidens sat in snow-white caps and in kirtles</l>
        <l n="21">Scarlet and blue and green , with distaffs spinning the golden</l>
        <l n="22">Flax for the gossiping looms , whose noisy shuttles within doors</l>
        <l n="23">Mingled their sounds with the whir of the wheels and the songs of the</l>

        <l n="25">Solemnly down the street came the parish priest , and the children</l>
        <l n="26">Paused in their play to kiss the hand he extended to bless them .</l>
        <l n="27">Reverend walked he among them ; and up rose matrons and maidens ,</l>
        <l n="28">Hailing his slow approach with words of affectionate welcome .</l>
        <l n="29">Then came the laborers home from the field , and serenely the sun sank</l>
        <l n="30">Down to his rest , and twilight prevailed . Anon from the belfry</l>
        <l n="31">Softly the Angelus sounded , and over the roofs of the village</l>
        <l n="32">Columns of pale blue smoke , like clouds of incense ascending ,</l>
        <l n="33">Rose from a hundred hearths , the homes of peace and contentment .</l>
        <l n="34">Thus dwelt together in love these simple Acadian farmers ,—</l>
        <l n="35">Dwelt in the love of God and of man . Alike were they free from</l>
        <l n="36">Fear , that reigns with the tyrant , and envy , the vice of republics .</l>
        <l n="37">Neither locks had they to their doors , nor bars to their windows ;</l>
        <l n="38">But their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of the owners ;</l>
        <l n="39">There the richest was poor , and the poorest lived in abundance .</l>

        <l n="40">Somewhat apart from the village , and nearer the Basin of Minas ,</l>
        <l n="41">Benedict Bellefontaine , the wealthiest farmer of Grand-Pre ,</l>
        <l n="42">Dwelt on his goodly acres ; and with him , directing his household ,</l>
        <l n="43">Gentle Evangeline lived , his child , and the pride of the village .</l>
        <l n="44">Stalworth and stately in form was the man of seventy winters ;</l>
        <l n="45">Hearty and hale was he , an oak that is covered with snow-flakes ;</l>
        <l n="46">White as the snow were his locks , and his cheeks as brown as the</l>
        <l n="47">oak-leaves .</l>
        <l n="48">Fair was she to behold , that maiden of seventeen summers .</l>
        <l n="49">Black were her eyes as the berry that grows on the thorn by the wayside ,</l>
        <l n="50">Black , yet how softly they gleamed beneath the brown shade of her tresses !</l>
        <l n="51">Sweet was her breath as the breath of kine that feed in the meadows .</l>
        <l n="52">When in the harvest heat she bore to the reapers at noontide</l>
        <l n="53">Flagons of home-brewed ale , ah ! fair in sooth was the maiden .</l>
        <l n="54">Fair was she when , on Sunday morn , while the bell from its turret</l>
        <l n="55">Sprinkled with holy sounds the air , as the priest with his hyssop</l>
        <l n="56">Sprinkles the congregation , and scatters blessings upon them ,</l>
        <l n="57">Down the long street she passed , with her chaplet of beads and her missal ,</l>
        <l n="58">Wearing her Norman cap , and her kirtle of blue , and the ear-rings ,</l>
        <l n="59">Brought in the olden time from France , and since , as an heirloom ,</l>
        <l n="60">Handed down from mother to child , through long generations .</l>
        <l n="61">But a celestial brightness — a more ethereal beauty —</l>
        <l n="62">Shone on her face and encircled her form , when , after confession ,</l>
        <l n="63">Homeward serenely she walked with God 's benediction upon her .</l>
        <l n="64">When she had passed , it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music .</l>

        <l n="65">Firmly builded with rafters of oak , the house of the farmer</l>
        <l n="66">Stood on the side of a hill commanding the sea ; and a shady</l>
        <l n="67">Sycamore grew by the door , with a woodbine wreathing around it .</l>
        <l n="68">Rudely carved was the porch , with seats beneath ; and a footpath</l>
        <l n="69">Led through an orchard wide , and disappeared in the meadow .</l>
        <l n="70">Under the sycamore-tree were hives overhung by a penthouse ,</l>
        <l n="71">Such as the traveller sees in regions remote by the roadside ,</l>
        <l n="72">Built o'er a box for the poor , or the blessed image of Mary .</l>
        <l n="73">Farther down , on the slope of the hill , was the well with its moss-grown</l>
        <l n="74">Bucket , fastened with iron , and near it a trough for the horses .</l>
        <l n="75">Shielding the house from storms , on the north , were the barns and the</l>
        <l n="76">farm-yard .</l>
        <l n="77">There stood the broad-wheeled wains and the antique ploughs and the</l>
        <l n="78">harrows ;</l>
        <l n="79">There were the folds for the sheep ; and there , in his feathered seraglio ,</l>
        <l n="80">Strutted the lordly turkey , and crowed the cock , with the selfsame</l>
        <l n="81">Voice that in ages of old had startled the penitent Peter .</l>
        <l n="82">Bursting with hay were the barns , themselves a village . In each one</l>
        <l n="83">Far o'er the gable projected a roof of thatch ; and a staircase ,</l>
        <l n="84">Under the sheltering eaves , led up to the odorous corn-loft .</l>
        <l n="85">There too the dove-cot stood , with its meek and innocent inmates</l>
        <l n="86">Murmuring ever of love ; while above in the variant breezes</l>
        <l n="87">Numberless noisy weathercocks rattled and sang of mutation .</l>

        <l n="88">Thus , at peace with God and the world , the farmer of Grand-Pre</l>
        <l n="89">Lived on his sunny farm , and Evangeline governed his household .</l>
        <l n="90">Many a youth , as he knelt in church and opened his missal ,</l>
        <l n="91">Fixed his eyes upon her as the saint of his deepest devotion ;</l>
        <l n="92">Happy was he who might touch her hand or the hem of her garment !</l>
        <l n="93">Many a suitor came to her door , by the darkness befriended ,</l>
        <l n="94">And , as he knocked and waited to hear the sound of her footsteps ,</l>
        <l n="95">Knew not which beat the louder , his heart or the knocker of iron ;</l>
        <l n="96">Or at the joyous feast of the Patron Saint of the village ,</l>
        <l n="97">Bolder grew , and pressed her hand in the dance as he whispered</l>
        <l n="98">Hurried words of love , that seemed a part of the music .</l>
        <l n="99">But , among all who came , young Gabriel only was welcome ;</l>
        <l n="100">Gabriel Lajeunesse . the son of Basil the blacksmith ,</l>
        <l n="101">Who was a mighty man in the village , and honored of all men ;</l>
        <l n="102">For , since the birth of time , throughout all ages and nations ,</l>
        <l n="103">Has the craft of the smith been held in repute by the people .</l>
        <l n="104">Basil was Benedict 's friend . Their children from earliest childhood</l>
        <l n="105">Grew up together as brother and sister ; and Father Felician ,</l>
        <l n="106">Priest and pedagogue both in the village , had taught them their letters</l>
        <l n="107">Out of the selfsame book , with the hymns of the church and the plain-song .</l>
        <l n="108">But when the hymn was sung , and the daily lesson completed ,</l>
        <l n="109">Swiftly they hurried away to the forge of Basil the blacksmith .</l>
        <l n="110">There at the door they stood , with wondering eyes to behold him</l>
        <l n="111">Take in his leathern lap the hoof of the horse as a plaything ,</l>
        <l n="112">Nailing the shoe in its place ; while near him the tire of the cart-wheel</l>
        <l n="113">Lay like a fiery snake , coiled round in a circle of cinders .</l>
        <l n="114">Oft on autumnal eves , when without in the gathering darkness</l>
        <l n="115">Bursting with light seemed the smithy , through every cranny and crevice ,</l>
        <l n="116">Warm by the forge within they watched the laboring bellows ,</l>
        <l n="117">And as its panting ceased , and the sparks expired in the ashes ,</l>
        <l n="118">Merrily laughed , and said they were nuns going into the chapel .</l>
        <l n="119">Oft on sledges in winter , as swift as the swoop of the eagle ,</l>
        <l n="120">Down the hillside bounding , they glided away o'er the meadow .</l>
        <l n="121">Oft in the barns they climbed to the populous nests on the rafters ,</l>
        <l n="122">Seeking with eager eyes that wondrous stone , which the swallow</l>
        <l n="123">Brings from the shore of the sea to restore the sight of its fledglings ;</l>
        <l n="124">Lucky was he who found that stone in the nest of the swallow !</l>
        <l n="125">Thus passed a few swift years , and they no longer were children .</l>
        <l n="126">He was a valiant youth , and his face , like the face of the morning ,</l>
        <l n="127">Gladdened the earth with its light , and ripened thought into action .</l>
        <l n="128">She was a woman now , with the heart and hopes of a woman .</l>
        <l n="129">“ Sunshine of Saint Eulalie ” was she called ; for that was the sunshine</l>
        <l n="130">Which , as the farmers believed , would load their orchards with apples ;</l>
        <l n="131">She , too , would bring to her husband 's house delight and abundance ,</l>
        <l n="132">Filling it with love and the ruddy faces of children .</l>

        <l n="133">Now had the season returned , when the nights grow colder and longer ,</l>
        <l n="134">And the retreating sun the sign of the Scorpion enters .</l>
        <l n="135">Birds of passage sailed through the leaden air , from the ice-bound ,</l>
        <l n="136">Desolate northern bays to the shores of tropical islands .</l>
        <l n="137">Harvests were gathered in ; and wild with the winds of September</l>
        <l n="138">Wrestled the trees of the forest , as Jacob of old with the angel .</l>
        <l n="139">All the signs foretold a winter long and inclement .</l>
        <l n="140">Bees , with prophetic instinct of want , had hoarded their honey</l>

        <l n="142">Cold would the winter be , for thick was the fur of the foxes .</l>
        <l n="143">Such was the advent of autumn . Then followed that beautiful season ,</l>
        <l n="144">Called by the pious Acadian peasants the Summer of All-Saints !</l>
        <l n="145">Filled was the air with a dreamy and magical light ; and the landscape</l>
        <l n="146">Lay as if new-created in all the freshness of childhood .</l>
        <l n="147">Peace seemed to reign upon earth , and the restless heart of the ocean</l>
        <l n="148">Was for a moment consoled . All sounds were in harmony blended .</l>
        <l n="149">Voices of children at play , the crowing of cocks in the farm-yards ,</l>
        <l n="150">Whir of wings in the drowsy air , and the cooing of pigeons ,</l>
        <l n="151">All were subdued and low as the murmurs of love , and the great sun</l>
        <l n="152">Looked with the eye of love through the golden vapors around him ;</l>
        <l n="153">While arrayed in its robes of russet and scarlet and yellow ,</l>
        <l n="154">Bright with the sheen of the dew , each glittering tree of the forest</l>
        <l n="155">Flashed like the plane-tree the Persian adorned with mantles and jewels .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="6">
        <l n="156">Now recommenced the reign of rest and affection and stillness .</l>
        <l n="157">Day with its burden and heat had departed , and twilight descending</l>
        <l n="158">Brought back the evening star to the sky , and the herds to the homestead .</l>
        <l n="159">Pawing the ground they came , and resting their necks on each other ,</l>
        <l n="160">And with their nostrils distended inhaling the freshness of evening .</l>
        <l n="161">Foremost , bearing the bell , Evangeline 's beautiful heifer ,</l>
        <l n="162">Proud of her snow-white hide , and the ribbon that waved from her collar ,</l>
        <l n="163">Quietly paced and slow , as if conscious of human affection .</l>
        <l n="164">Then came the shepherd back with his bleating flocks from the seaside ,</l>
        <l n="165">Where was their favorite pasture . Behind them followed the watch-dog ,</l>
        <l n="166">Patient , full of importance , and grand in the pride of his instinct ,</l>
        <l n="167">Walking from side to side with a lordly air , and superbly</l>
        <l n="168">Waving his bushy tail , and urging forward the stragglers ;</l>
        <l n="169">Regent of flocks was he when the shepherd slept ; their protector ,</l>
        <l n="170">When from the forest at night , through the starry silence the wolves</l>
        <l n="171">howled .</l>
        <l n="172">Late , with the rising moon , returned the wains from the marshes ,</l>
        <l n="173">Laden with briny hay , that filled the air with its odor .</l>
        <l n="174">Cheerily neighed the steeds , with dew on their manes and their fetlocks ,</l>
        <l n="175">While aloft on their shoulders the wooden and ponderous saddles ,</l>
        <l n="176">Painted with brilliant dyes , and adorned with tassels of crimson ,</l>
        <l n="177">Nodded in bright array , like hollyhocks heavy with blossoms .</l>
        <l n="178">Patiently stood the cows meanwhile , and yielded their udders</l>
        <l n="179">Unto the milkmaid 's hand ; whilst loud and in regular cadence</l>
        <l n="180">Into the sounding pails the foaming streamlets descended .</l>
        <l n="181">Lowing of cattle and peals of laughter were heard in the farm-yard ,</l>
        <l n="182">Echoed back by the barns . Anon they sank into stillness ;</l>
        <l n="183">Heavily closed , with a jarring sound , the valves of the barn-doors ,</l>
        <l n="184">Rattled the wooden bars , and all for a season was silent .</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="7">
        <l n="185">In-doors , warm by the wide-mouthed fireplace , idly the farmer</l>
        <l n="186">Sat in his elbow-chair and watched how the flames and the smoke-wreaths</l>
        <l n="187">Struggled together like foes in a burning city . Behind him ,</l>
        <l n="188">Nodding and mocking along the wall , with gestures fantastic ,</l>
        <l n="189">Darted his own huge shadow , and vanished away into darkness .</l>
        <l n="190">Faces , clumsily carved in oak , on the back of his arm-chair</l>
        <l n="191">Laughed in the flickering light ; and the pewter plates on the dresser</l>
        <l n="192">Caught and reflected the flame , as shields of armies the sunshine .</l>
        <l n="193">Fragments of song the old man sang , and carols of Christmas ,</l>
        <l n="194">Such as at home , in the olden time , his fathers before him</l>
        <l n="195">Sang in their Norman orchards and bright Burgundian vineyards .</l>
        <l n="196">Close at her father 's side was the gentle Evangeline seated ,</l>
        <l n="197">Spinning flax for the loom , that stood in the corner behind her .</l>
        <l n="198">Silent awhile were its treadles , at rest was its diligent shuttle ,</l>
        <l n="199">While the monotonous drone of the wheel , like the drone of a bagpipe ,</l>
        <l n="200">Followed the old man 's song and united the fragments together .</l>
        <l n="201">As in a church , when the chant of the choir at intervals ceases ,</l>
        <l n="202">Footfalls are heard in the aisles , or words of the priest at the altar ,</l>
        <l n="203">So , in each pause of the song , with measured motion the clock clicked .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="8">
        <l n="204">Thus as they sat , there were footsteps heard , and , suddenly lifted ,</l>
        <l n="205">Sounded the wooden latch , and the door swung back on its hinges .</l>
        <l n="206">Benedict knew by the hob-nailed shoes it was Basil the blacksmith ,</l>
        <l n="207">And by her beating heart Evangeline knew who was with him .</l>
        <l n="208">“ Welcome ! ” the farmer exclaimed , as their footsteps paused on the</l>
        <l n="209">threshold ,</l>
        <l n="210">“ Welcome , Basil , my friend ! Come , take thy place on the settle</l>
        <l n="211">Close by the chimney-side , which is always empty without thee ;</l>
        <l n="212">Take from the shelf overhead thy pipe and the box of tobacco ;</l>
        <l n="213">Never so much thyself art thou as when through the curling</l>
        <l n="214">Smoke of the pipe or the forge thy friendly and jovial face gleams</l>
        <l n="215">Round and red as the harvest moon through the mist of the marshes . ”</l>
        <l n="216">Then , with a smile of content , thus answered Basil the blacksmith ,</l>
        <l n="217">Taking with easy air the accustomed seat by the fireside :—</l>
        <l n="218">“ Benedict Bellefontaine , thou hast ever thy jest and thy ballad !</l>
        <l n="219">Ever in cheerfullest mood art thou , when others are filled with</l>
        <l n="220">Gloomy forebodings of ill , and see only ruin before them .</l>
        <l n="221">Happy art thou , as if every day thou hadst picked up a horseshoe . ”</l>
        <l n="222">Pausing a moment , to take the pipe that Evangeline brought him ,</l>
        <l n="223">And with a coal from the embers had lighted , he slowly continued :—</l>
        <l n="224">“ Four days now are passed since the English ships at their anchors</l>
        <l n="225">Ride in the Gaspereau 's mouth , with their cannon pointed against us .</l>
        <l n="226">What their design may be is unknown ; but all are commanded</l>
        <l n="227">On the morrow to meet in the church , where his Majesty 's mandate</l>
        <l n="228">Will be proclaimed as law in the land . Alas ! in the mean time</l>
        <l n="229">Many surmises of evil alarm the hearts of the people . ”</l>
        <l n="230">Then made answer the farmer : “ Perhaps some friendlier purpose</l>
        <l n="231">Brings these ships to our shores . Perhaps the harvests in England</l>
        <l n="232">By untimely rains or untimelier heat have been blighted ,</l>
        <l n="233">And from our bursting barns they would feed their cattle and children . ”</l>
        <l n="234">“ Not so thinketh the folk in the village , ” said , warmly , the blacksmith ,</l>
        <l n="235">Shaking his head , as in doubt ; then , heaving a sigh , he continued :—</l>
        <l n="236">“ Louisburg is not forgotten , nor Beau Sejour , nor Port Royal ,</l>
        <l n="237">Many already have fled to the forest , and lurk on its outskirts ,</l>
        <l n="238">Waiting with anxious hearts the dubious fate of tomorrow .</l>
        <l n="239">Arms have been taken from us , and warlike weapons of all kinds ;</l>
        <l n="240">Nothing is left but the blacksmith 's sledge and the scythe of the mower . ”</l>
        <l n="241">Then with a pleasant smile made answer the jovial farmer :—</l>
        <l n="242">“ Safer are we unarmed , in the midst of our flocks and our cornfields ,</l>
        <l n="243">Safer within these peaceful dikes , besieged by the ocean ,</l>
        <l n="244">Than our fathers in forts , besieged by the enemy 's cannon .</l>
        <l n="245">Fear no evil , my friend , and to-night may no shadow of sorrow</l>
        <l n="246">Fall on this house and hearth ; for this is the night of the contract .</l>
        <l n="247">Built are the house and the barn . The merry lads of the village</l>
        <l n="248">Strongly have built them and well ; and , breaking the glebe round about</l>
        <l n="249">them ,</l>
        <l n="250">Filled the barn with hay , and the house with food for a twelvemonth .</l>
        <l n="251">Rene Leblanc will be here anon , with his papers and inkhorn .</l>
        <l n="252">Shall we not then be glad , and rejoice in the joy of our children ? ”</l>
        <l n="253">As apart by the window she stood , with her hand in her lover 's ,</l>
        <l n="254">Blushing Evangeline heard the words that her father had spoken ,</l>
        <l n="255">And , as they died on his lips , the worthy notary entered .</l>

        <l n="257">Bent , but not broken , by age was the form of the notary public ;</l>
        <l n="258">Shocks of yellow hair , like the silken floss of the maize , hung</l>
        <l n="259">Over his shoulders ; his forehead was high ; and glasses with horn bows</l>
        <l n="260">Sat astride on his nose , with a look of wisdom supernal .</l>
        <l n="261">Father of twenty children was he , and more than a hundred</l>
        <l n="262">Children 's children rode on his knee , and heard his great watch tick .</l>
        <l n="263">Four long years in the times of the war had he languished a captive ,</l>
        <l n="264">Suffering much in an old French fort as the friend of the English .</l>
        <l n="265">Now , though warier grown , without all guile or suspicion ,</l>
        <l n="266">Ripe in wisdom was he , but patient , and simple , and childlike .</l>
        <l n="267">He was beloved by all , and most of all by the children ;</l>
        <l n="268">For he told them tales of the Loup-garou in the forest ,</l>
        <l n="269">And of the goblin that came in the night to water the horses ,</l>
        <l n="270">And of the white Letiche , the ghost of a child who unchristened</l>
        <l n="271">Died , and was doomed to haunt unseen the chambers of children ;</l>
        <l n="272">And how on Christmas eve the oxen talked in the stable ,</l>
        <l n="273">And how the fever was cured by a spider shut up in a nutshell ,</l>
        <l n="274">And of the marvellous powers of four-leaved clover and horseshoes ,</l>
        <l n="275">With whatsoever else was writ in the lore of the village .</l>
        <l n="276">Then up rose from his seat by the fireside Basil the blacksmith ,</l>
        <l n="277">Knocked from his pipe the ashes , and slowly extending his right hand ,</l>
        <l n="278">“ Father Leblanc , ” he exclaimed , “ thou hast heard the talk in the village ,</l>
        <l n="279">And , perchance , canst tell us some news of these ships and their errand . ”</l>
        <l n="280">Then with modest demeanor made answer the notary public ,—</l>
        <l n="281">“ Gossip enough have I heard , in sooth , yet am never the wiser ;</l>
        <l n="282">And what their errand may be I know not better than others .</l>
        <l n="283">Yet am I not of those who imagine some evil intention</l>
        <l n="284">Brings them here , for we are at peace ; and why then molest us ? ”</l>
        <l n="285">“ God 's name ! ” shouted the hasty and somewhat irascible blacksmith ;</l>
        <l n="286">“ Must we in all things look for the how , and the why , and the wherefore ?</l>
        <l n="287">Daily injustice is done , and might is the right of the strongest ! ”</l>
        <l n="288">But without heeding his warmth , continued the notary public ,—</l>
        <l n="289">“ Man is unjust , but God is just ; and finally justice</l>
        <l n="290">Triumphs ; and well I remember a story , that often consoled me ,</l>
        <l n="291">When as a captive I lay in the old French fort at Port Royal . ”</l>
        <l n="292">This was the old man 's favorite tale , and he loved to repeat it</l>
        <l n="293">When his neighbors complained that any injustice was done them .</l>
        <l n="294">“ Once in an ancient city , whose name I no longer remember ,</l>
        <l n="295">Raised aloft on a column , a brazen statue of Justice</l>
        <l n="296">Stood in the public square , upholding the scales in its left hand ,</l>
        <l n="297">And in its right a sword , as an emblem that justice presided</l>
        <l n="298">Over the laws of the land , and the hearts and homes of the people .</l>
        <l n="299">Even the birds had built their nests in the scales of the balance ,</l>
        <l n="300">Having no fear of the sword that flashed in the sunshine above them .</l>
        <l n="301">But in the course of time the laws of the land were corrupted ;</l>
        <l n="302">Might took the place of right , and the weak were oppressed , and the mighty</l>
        <l n="303">Ruled with an iron rod . Then it chanced in a nobleman 's palace</l>
        <l n="304">That a necklace of pearls was lost , and erelong a suspicion</l>
        <l n="305">Fell on an orphan girl who lived as a maid in the household .</l>
        <l n="306">She , after form of trial condemned to die on the scaffold ,</l>
        <l n="307">Patiently met her doom at the foot of the statue of Justice .</l>
        <l n="308">As to her Father in heaven her innocent spirit ascended ,</l>
        <l n="309">Lo ! o'er the city a tempest rose ; and the bolts of the thunder</l>
        <l n="310">Smote the statue of bronze , and hurled in wrath from its left hand</l>
        <l n="311">Down on the pavement below the clattering scales of the balance ,</l>
        <l n="312">And in the hollow thereof was found the nest of a magpie ,</l>
        <l n="313">Into whose clay-built walls the necklace of pearls was inwoven . ”</l>
        <l n="314">Silenced , but not convinced , when the story was ended , the blacksmith</l>
        <l n="315">Stood like a man who fain would speak , but findeth no language ;</l>
        <l n="316">All his thoughts were congealed into lines on his face , as the vapors</l>
        <l n="317">Freeze in fantastic shapes on the window-panes in the winter .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="10">
        <l n="318">Then Evangeline lighted the brazen lamp on the table ,</l>
        <l n="319">Filled , till it overflowed , the pewter tankard with home-brewed</l>
        <l n="320">Nut-brown ale , that was famed for its strength in the village of Grand-Pre ;</l>
        <l n="321">While from his pocket the notary drew his papers and inkhorn ,</l>
        <l n="322">Wrote with a steady hand the date and the age of the parties ,</l>
        <l n="323">Naming the dower of the bride in flocks of sheep and in cattle .</l>
        <l n="324">Orderly all things proceeded , and duly and well were completed ,</l>
        <l n="325">And the great seal of the law was set like a sun on the margin .</l>
        <l n="326">Then from his leathern pouch the farmer threw on the table</l>
        <l n="327">Three times the old man 's fee in solid pieces of silver ;</l>
        <l n="328">And the notary rising , and blessing the bride and the bridegroom ,</l>
        <l n="329">Lifted aloft the tankard of ale and drank to their welfare .</l>
        <l n="330">Wiping the foam from his lip , he solemnly bowed and departed ,</l>
        <l n="331">While in silence the others sat and mused by the fireside ,</l>
        <l n="332">Till Evangeline brought the draught-board out of its corner .</l>
        <l n="333">Soon was the game begun . In friendly contention the old men</l>
        <l n="334">Laughed at each lucky hit , or unsuccessful manoeuvre ,</l>
        <l n="335">Laughed when a man was crowned , or a breach was made in the king-row .</l>
        <l n="336">Meanwhile apart , in the twilight gloom of a window 's embrasure ,</l>
        <l n="337">Sat the lovers , and whispered together , beholding the moon rise</l>
        <l n="338">Over the pallid sea , and the silvery mists of the meadows .</l>
        <l n="339">Silently one by one , in the infinite meadows of heaven ,</l>
        <l n="340">Blossomed the lovely stars , the forget-me-nots of the angels .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="11">
        <l n="341">Thus was the evening passed . Anon the bell from the belfry</l>
        <l n="342">Rang out the hour of nine , the village curfew , and straightway</l>
        <l n="343">Rose the guests and departed ; and silence reigned in the household .</l>
        <l n="344">Many a farewell word and sweet good-night on the door-step</l>
        <l n="345">Lingered long in Evangeline 's heart , and filled it with gladness .</l>
        <l n="346">Carefully then were covered the embers that glowed on the hearth-stone ,</l>
        <l n="347">And on the oaken stairs resounded the tread of the farmer .</l>
        <l n="348">Soon with a soundless step the foot of Evangeline followed .</l>
        <l n="349">Up the staircase moved a luminous space in the darkness ,</l>
        <l n="350">Lighted less by the lamp than the shining face of the maiden .</l>
        <l n="351">Silent she passed the hall , and entered the door of her chamber .</l>
        <l n="352">Simple that chamber was , with its curtains of white , and its clothes-press</l>
        <l n="353">Ample and high , on whose spacious shelves were carefully folded</l>
        <l n="354">Linen and woollen stuffs , by the hand of Evangeline woven .</l>
        <l n="355">This was the precious dower she would bring to her husband in marriage ,</l>
        <l n="356">Better than flocks and herds , being proofs of her skill as a housewife .</l>
        <l n="357">Soon she extinguished her lamp , for the mellow and radiant moonlight</l>
        <l n="358">Streamed through the windows , and lighted the room , till the heart of</l>
        <l n="359">the maiden</l>
        <l n="360">Swelled and obeyed its power , like the tremulous tides of the ocean .</l>
        <l n="361">Ah ! she was fair , exceeding fair to behold , as she stood with</l>
        <l n="362">Naked snow-white feet on the gleaming floor of her chamber !</l>
        <l n="363">Little she dreamed that below , among the trees of the orchard ,</l>
        <l n="364">Waited her lover and watched for the gleam of her lamp and her shadow .</l>
        <l n="365">Yet were her thoughts of him , and at times a feeling of sadness</l>
        <l n="366">Passed o'er her soul , as the sailing shade of clouds in the moonlight</l>
        <l n="367">Flitted across the floor and darkened the room for a moment .</l>
        <l n="368">And , as she gazed from the window , she saw serenely the moon pass</l>
        <l n="369">Forth from the folds of a cloud , and one star follow her footsteps ,</l>
        <l n="370">As out of Abraham 's tent young Ishmael wandered with Hagar !</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="12">
        <l n="371">Pleasantly rose next morn the sun on the village of Grand-Pre .</l>
        <l n="372">Pleasantly gleamed in the soft , sweet air the Basin of Minas ,</l>
        <l n="373">Where the ships , with their wavering shadows , were riding at anchor .</l>
        <l n="374">Life had long been astir in the village , and clamorous labor</l>
        <l n="375">Knocked with its hundred hands at the golden gates of the morning .</l>
        <l n="376">Now from the country around , from the farms and neighboring hamlets ,</l>
        <l n="377">Came in their holiday dresses the blithe Acadian peasants .</l>
        <l n="378">Many a glad good-morrow and jocund laugh from the young folk</l>
        <l n="379">Made the bright air brighter , as up from the numerous meadows ,</l>
        <l n="380">Where no path could be seen but the track of wheels in the greensward ,</l>
        <l n="381">Group after group appeared , and joined , or passed on the highway .</l>
        <l n="382">Long ere noon , in the village all sounds of labor were silenced .</l>
        <l n="383">Thronged were the streets with people ; and noisy groups at the house-doors</l>
        <l n="384">Sat in the cheerful sun , and rejoiced and gossiped together .</l>
        <l n="385">Every house was an inn , where all were welcomed and feasted ;</l>
        <l n="386">For with this simple people , who lived like brothers together ,</l>
        <l n="387">All things were held in common , and what one had was another 's .</l>
        <l n="388">Yet under Benedict 's roof hospitality seemed more abundant :</l>
        <l n="389">For Evangeline stood among the guests of her father ;</l>
        <l n="390">Bright was her face with smiles , and words of welcome and gladness</l>
        <l n="391">Fell from her beautiful lips , and blessed the cup as she gave it .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="13">
        <l n="392">Under the open sky , in the odorous air of the orchard ,</l>
        <l n="393">Stript of its golden fruit , was spread the feast of betrothal .</l>
        <l n="394">There in the shade of the porch were the priest and the notary seated ;</l>
        <l n="395">There good Benedict sat , and sturdy Basil the blacksmith .</l>
        <l n="396">Not far withdrawn from these , by the cider-press and the beehives ,</l>
        <l n="397">Michael the fiddler was placed , with the gayest of hearts and of</l>
        <l n="398">waistcoats .</l>
        <l n="399">Shadow and light from the leaves alternately played on his snow-white</l>
        <l n="400">Hair , as it waved in the wind ; and the jolly face of the fiddler</l>
        <l n="401">Glowed like a living coal when the ashes are blown from the embers .</l>
        <l n="402">Gayly the old man sang to the vibrant sound of his fiddle ,</l>
        <l n="403">Tous les Bourgeois de Chartres , and Le Carillon de Dunquerque ,</l>
        <l n="404">And anon with his wooden shoes beat time to the music .</l>
        <l n="405">Merrily , merrily whirled the wheels of the dizzying dances</l>
        <l n="406">Under the orchard-trees and down the path to the meadows ;</l>
        <l n="407">Old folk and young together , and children mingled among them .</l>
        <l n="408">Fairest of all the maids was Evangeline , Benedict 's daughter !</l>
        <l n="409">Noblest of all the youths was Gabriel , son of the blacksmith !</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="14">
        <l n="410">So passed the morning away . And lo ! with a summons sonorous</l>
        <l n="411">Sounded the bell from its tower , and over the meadows a drum beat .</l>
        <l n="412">Thronged erelong was the church with men . Without , in the churchyard ,</l>
        <l n="413">Waited the women . They stood by the graves , and hung on the headstones</l>
        <l n="414">Garlands of autumn-leaves and evergreens fresh from the forest .</l>
        <l n="415">Then came the guard from the ships , and marching proudly among them</l>
        <l n="416">Entered the sacred portal . With loud and dissonant clangor</l>
        <l n="417">Echoed the sound of their brazen drums from ceiling and casement ,—</l>
        <l n="418">Echoed a moment only , and slowly the ponderous portal</l>
        <l n="419">Closed , and in silence the crowd awaited the will of the soldiers .</l>
        <l n="420">Then uprose their commander , and spake from the steps of the altar ,</l>
        <l n="421">Holding aloft in his hands , with its seals , the royal commission .</l>
        <l n="422">“ You are convened this day , ” he said , “ by his Majesty 's orders .</l>
        <l n="423">Clement and kind has he been ; but how you have answered his kindness ,</l>
        <l n="424">Let your own hearts reply ! To my natural make and my temper</l>
        <l n="425">Painful the task is I do , which to you I know must be grievous .</l>
        <l n="426">Yet must I bow and obey , and deliver the will of our monarch ;</l>
        <l n="427">Namely , that all your lands , and dwellings , and cattle of all kinds</l>
        <l n="428">Forfeited be to the crown ; and that you yourselves from this province</l>
        <l n="429">Be transported to other lands . God grant you may dwell there</l>
        <l n="430">Ever as faithful subjects , a happy and peaceable people !</l>
        <l n="431">Prisoners now I declare you ; for such is his Majesty 's pleasure ! ”</l>
        <l n="432">As , when the air is serene in sultry solstice of summer ,</l>
        <l n="433">Suddenly gathers a storm , and the deadly sling of the hailstones</l>
        <l n="434">Beats down the farmer 's corn in the field and shatters his windows ,</l>
        <l n="435">Hiding the sun , and strewing the ground with thatch from the house-roofs ,</l>
        <l n="436">Bellowing fly the herds , and seek to break their enclosures ;</l>
        <l n="437">So on the hearts of the people descended the words of the speaker .</l>
        <l n="438">Silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder , and then rose</l>
        <l n="439">Louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger ,</l>
        <l n="440">And , by one impulse moved , they madly rushed to the door-way .</l>
        <l n="441">Vain was the hope of escape ; and cries and fierce imprecations</l>
        <l n="442">Rang through the house of prayer ; and high o'er the heads of the others</l>
        <l n="443">Rose , with his arms uplifted , the figure of Basil the blacksmith ,</l>
        <l n="444">As , on a stormy sea , a spar is tossed by the billows .</l>
        <l n="445">Flushed was his face and distorted with passion ; and wildly he shouted ,—</l>
        <l n="446">“ Down with the tyrants of England ! we never have sworn them allegiance !</l>
        <l n="447">Death to these foreign soldiers , who seize on our homes and our harvests ! ”</l>
        <l n="448">More he fain would have said , but the merciless hand of a soldier</l>
        <l n="449">Smote him upon the mouth , and dragged him down to the pavement .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="15">
        <l n="450">In the midst of the strife and tumult of angry contention ,</l>
        <l n="451">Lo ! the door of the chancel opened , and Father Felician</l>
        <l n="452">Entered , with serious mien , and ascended the steps of the altar .</l>
        <l n="453">Raising his reverend hand , with a gesture he awed into silence</l>
        <l n="454">All that clamorous throng ; and thus he spake to his people ;</l>
        <l n="455">Deep were his tones and solemn ; in accents measured and mournful</l>
        <l n="456">Spake he , as , after the tocsin 's alarum , distinctly the clock strikes .</l>
        <l n="457">“ What is this that ye do , my children ? what madness has seized you ?</l>
        <l n="458">Forty years of my life have I labored among you , and taught you ,</l>
        <l n="459">Not in word alone , but in deed , to love one another !</l>
        <l n="460">Is this the fruit of my toils , of my vigils and prayers and privations ?</l>
        <l n="461">Have you so soon forgotten all lessons of love and forgiveness ?</l>
        <l n="462">This is the house of the Prince of Peace , and would you profane it</l>
        <l n="463">Thus with violent deeds and hearts overflowing with hatred ?</l>
        <l n="464">Lo ! where the crucified Christ from his cross is gazing upon you !</l>
        <l n="465">See ! in those sorrowful eyes what meekness and holy compassion !</l>
        <l n="466">Hark ! how those lips still repeat the prayer , ‘ O Father , forgive them ! ’</l>
        <l n="467">Let us repeat that prayer in the hour when the wicked assail us ,</l>
        <l n="468">Let us repeat it now , and say , ‘ O Father , forgive them ! ’ ”</l>
        <l n="469">Few were his words of rebuke , but deep in the hearts of his people</l>
        <l n="470">Sank they , and sobs of contrition succeeded the passionate outbreak ,</l>
        <l n="471">While they repeated his prayer , and said , “ O Father , forgive them ! ”</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="16">
        <l n="472">Then came the evening service . The tapers gleamed from the altar .</l>
        <l n="473">Fervent and deep was the voice of the priest , and the people responded ,</l>
        <l n="474">Not with their lips alone , but their hearts ; and the Ave Maria</l>
        <l n="475">Sang they , and fell on their knees , and their souls , with devotion</l>
        <l n="476">translated ,</l>

        <l n="480">Long at her father 's door Evangeline stood , with her right hand</l>
        <l n="481">Shielding her eyes from the level rays of the sun , that , descending ,</l>

        <l n="484">Long within had been spread the snow-white cloth on the table ;</l>
        <l n="485">There stood the wheaten loaf , and the honey fragrant with wild-flowers ;</l>
        <l n="486">There stood the tankard of ale , and the cheese fresh brought from the</l>

        <l n="488">And , at the head of the board , the great arm-chair of the farmer .</l>
        <l n="489">Thus did Evangeline wait at her father 's door , as the sunset</l>
        <l n="490">Threw the long shadows of trees o'er the broad ambrosial meadows .</l>

        <l n="493">Charity , meekness , love , and hope , and forgiveness , and patience !</l>
        <l n="494">Then , all-forgetful of self , she wandered into the village ,</l>
        <l n="495">Cheering with looks and words the mournful hearts of the women ,</l>
        <l n="496">As o'er the darkening fields with lingering steps they departed ,</l>
        <l n="497">Urged by their household cares , and the weary feet of their children .</l>
        <l n="498">Down sank the great red sun , and in golden , glimmering vapors</l>
        <l n="499">Veiled the light of his face , like the Prophet descending from Sinai .</l>
        <l n="500">Sweetly over the village the bell of the Angelus sounded .</l>

        <l n="501">Meanwhile , amid the gloom , by the church Evangeline lingered .</l>

        <l n="503">Stood she , and listened and looked , till , overcome by emotion ,</l>
        <l n="504">“ Gabriel ! ” cried she aloud with tremulous voice ; but no answer</l>
        <l n="505">Came from the graves of the dead , nor the gloomier grave of the living .</l>
        <l n="506">Slowly at length she returned to the tenantless house of her father .</l>
        <l n="507">Smouldered the fire on the hearth , on the board was the supper untasted ,</l>
        <l n="508">Empty and drear was each room , and haunted with phantoms of terror .</l>
        <l n="509">Sadly echoed her step on the stair and the floor of her chamber .</l>
        <l n="510">In the dead of the night she heard the disconsolate rain fall</l>
        <l n="511">Loud on the withered leaves of the sycamore-tree by the window .</l>
        <l n="512">Keenly the lightning flashed ; and the voice of the echoing thunder</l>
        <l n="513">Told her that God was in heaven , and governed the world he created !</l>
        <l n="514">Then she remembered the tale she had heard of the justice of Heaven ;</l>
        <l n="515">Soothed was her troubled soul , and she peacefully slumbered till morning .</l>

        <l n="529">Late in the afternoon , when the sun was near to his setting ,</l>
        <l n="530">Echoed far o'er the fields came the roll of drums from the churchyard .</l>
        <l n="531">Thither the women and children thronged . On a sudden the church-doors</l>

        <l n="570">Fled away from the shore , and left the line of the sand-beach</l>
        <l n="571">Covered with waifs of the tide , with kelp and the slippery sea-weed .</l>
        <l n="572">Farther back in the midst of the household goods and the wagons ,</l>
        <l n="573">Like to a gypsy camp , or a leaguer after a battle ,</l>
        <l n="574">All escape cut off by the sea , and the sentinels near them ,</l>

        <l n="582">Waited and looked in vain for the voice and the hand of the milk-maid .</l>
        <l n="583">Silence reigned in the streets ; from the church no Angelus sounded ,</l>

        <l n="598">But , with a vacant stare , ever gazed at the flickering fire-light .</l>
        <l n="599">“ Benedicite ! ” murmured the priest , in tones of compassion .</l>

        <l n="602">Hushed by the scene he beholds , and the awful presence of sorrow .</l>
        <l n="603">Silently , therefore , he laid his hand on the head of the maiden ,</l>
        <l n="604">Raising his tearful eyes to the silent stars that above them</l>
        <l n="605">Moved on their way , unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals .</l>

        <l n="610">Seizing the rocks and the rivers and piling huge shadows together .</l>
        <l n="611">Broader and ever broader it gleamed on the roofs of the village ,</l>

        <l n="627">When the wild horses affrighted sweep by with the speed of the whirlwind ,</l>
        <l n="628">Or the loud bellowing herds of buffaloes rush to the river .</l>
        <l n="629">Such was the sound that arose on the night , as the herds and the horses</l>

        <l n="631">Overwhelmed with the sight , yet speechless , the priest and the maiden</l>

        <l n="634">Lo ! from his seat he had fallen , and stretched abroad on the sea-shore</l>
        <l n="635">Motionless lay his form , from which the soul had departed .</l>
        <l n="636">Slowly the priest uplifted the lifeless head , and the maiden</l>

        <l n="638">Then in a swoon she sank , and lay with her head on his bosom .</l>
        <l n="639">Through the long night she lay in deep , oblivious slumber ;</l>
        <l n="640">And when she awoke from the trance , she beheld a multitude near her .</l>
        <l n="641">Faces of friends she beheld , that were mournfully gazing upon her ,</l>

        <l n="643">Still the blaze of the burning village illumined the landscape ,</l>

        <l n="645">And like the day of doom it seemed to her wavering senses .</l>
        <l n="646">Then a familiar voice she heard , as it said to the people ,—</l>

        <l n="649">Then shall his sacred dust be piously laid in the churchyard . ”</l>
        <l n="650">Such were the words of the priest . And there in haste by the sea-side ,</l>
        <l n="651">Having the glare of the burning village for funeral torches ,</l>
        <l n="652">But without bell or book , they buried the farmer of Grand-Pre .</l>
        <l n="653">And as the voice of the priest repeated the service of sorrow ,</l>
        <l n="654">Lo ! with a mournful sound , like the voice of a vast congregation ,</l>
        <l n="655">Solemnly answered the sea , and mingled its roar with the dirges .</l>

       <l n="11">Play round the bows of ships ,</l>
       <l n="12">That steadily at anchor ride .</l>
       <l n="13">And with a voice that was full of glee ,</l>

       <l n="44">Might not the sharp bows overwhelm ;</l>
       <l n="45">Broad in the beam , but sloping aft</l>
       <l n="46">With graceful curve and slow degrees ,</l>
       <l n="47">That she might be docile to the helm ,</l>

      <docTitle><titlePart>PAUL REVERE 'S RIDE Listen , my children , and you shall hear Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere , On the eighteenth of April , in Seventy-five ; Hardly a man is now alive Who remembers that famous day and year . He said to his friend , “ If the British march By land or sea from the town to-night , Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry-arch Of the North Church tower as a signal light ,— One , if by land , and two , if by sea ; And I on the opposite shore will be , Ready to ride and spread the alarm Through every Middlesex village and farm , For the country folk to be up and to arm . ” Then he said , “ Good night ! ” and with muffled oar Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore , Just as the moon rose over the bay , Where swinging wide at her moorings lay The Somerset , British man-of-war ; A phantom ship , with each mast and spar Across the moon like a prison bar , And a huge black hulk , that was magnified By its own reflection in the tide . Meanwhile , his friend , through alley and street , Wanders and watches with eager ears , Till in the silence around him he hears The muster of men at the barrack door , The sound of arms , and the tramp of feet , And the measured tread of the grenadiers , Marching down to their boats on the shore . Then he climbed the tower of the Old North Church , By the wooden stairs , with stealthy tread , To the belfry-chamber overhead , And startled the pigeons from their perch On the sombre rafters , that round him made Masses and moving shapes of shade ,— By the trembling ladder , steep and tall , To the highest window in the wall , Where he paused to listen and look down A moment on the roofs of the town , And the moonlight flowing over all .</titlePart></docTitle>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="60">It was two by the village clock ,</l>
       <l n="61">When he came to the bridge in Concord town</l>
       <l n="62">He heard the bleating of the flock ,</l>
       <l n="63">And the twitter of birds among the trees ,</l>
       <l n="64">And felt the breath of the morning breeze</l>
       <l n="65">Blowing over the meadows brown .</l>
       <l n="66">And one was safe and asleep in his bed</l>
       <l n="67">Who at the bridge would be first to fall ,</l>
       <l n="68">Who that day would be lying dead ,</l>
       <l n="69">Pierced by a British musket-ball .</l>

       <l n="70">You know the rest . In the books you have read .</l>
       <l n="71">How the British Regulars fired and fled ,—</l>
       <l n="72">How the farmers gave them ball for ball ,</l>
       <l n="73">From behind each fence and farm-yard wall ,</l>
       <l n="74">Chasing the red-coats down the lane ,</l>
       <l n="75">Then crossing the fields to emerge again</l>
       <l n="76">Under the trees at the turn of the road ,</l>

       <l n="81">A cry of defiance and not of fear ,</l>
       <l n="82">A voice in the darkness , a knock at the door ,</l>

      <head>THE BUILDING OF THE LONG SERPENT</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Thorberg Skafting , master-builder ,</l>
       <l n="2">In his ship-yard by the sea ,</l>
       <l n="3">Whistling , said , “ It would bewilder</l>
       <l n="4">Any man but Thorberg Skafting ,</l>
       <l n="5">Any man but me ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="6">Near him lay the Dragon stranded ,</l>
       <l n="7">Built of old by Raud the Strong ,</l>
       <l n="8">And King Olaf had commanded</l>
       <l n="9">He should build another Dragon ,</l>
       <l n="10">Twice as large and long .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="11">Therefore whistled Thorberg Skafting ,</l>
       <l n="12">As he sat with half-closed eyes ,</l>
       <l n="13">And his head turned sideways , drafting</l>
       <l n="14">That new vessel for King Olaf</l>
       <l n="15">Twice the Dragon 's size .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="16">Round him busily hewed and hammered</l>
       <l n="17">Mallet huge and heavy axe ;</l>
       <l n="18">Workmen laughed and sang and clamored ;</l>
       <l n="19">Whirred the wheels , that into rigging</l>
       <l n="20">Spun the shining flax !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="21">All this tumult heard the master ,—</l>
       <l n="22">It was music to his ear ;</l>
       <l n="23">Fancy whispered all the faster ,</l>
       <l n="24">“ Men shall hear of Thorberg Skafting</l>
       <l n="25">For a hundred year ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="26">Workmen sweating at the forges</l>
       <l n="27">Fashioned iron bolt and bar ,</l>
       <l n="28">Like a warlock 's midnight orgies</l>
       <l n="29">Smoked and bubbled the black caldron</l>
       <l n="30">With the boiling tar .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="31">Did the warlocks mingle in it ,</l>
       <l n="32">Thorberg Skafting , any curse ?</l>
       <l n="33">Could you not be gone a minute</l>
       <l n="34">But some mischief must be doing ,</l>
       <l n="35">Turning bad to worse ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="36">‘ T was an ill wind that came wafting</l>
       <l n="37">From his homestead words of woe ;</l>
       <l n="38">To his farm went Thorberg Skafting ,</l>
       <l n="39">Oft repeating to his workmen ,</l>
       <l n="40">Build ye thus and so .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="41">After long delays returning</l>
       <l n="42">Came the master back by night ;</l>
       <l n="43">To his ship-yard longing , yearning ,</l>
       <l n="44">Hurried he , and did not leave it</l>
       <l n="45">Till the morning 's light .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="46">“ Come and see my ship , my darling ! ”</l>
       <l n="47">On the morrow said the King ;</l>

       <l n="49">Never yet was seen in Norway</l>
       <l n="50">Such a wondrous thing ! ”</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="51">In the ship-yard , idly talking ,</l>
       <l n="52">At the ship the workmen stared :</l>
       <l n="53">Some one , all their labor balking ,</l>
       <l n="54">Down her sides had cut deep gashes ,</l>
       <l n="55">Not a plank was spared !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="56">“ Death be to the evil-doer ! ”</l>
       <l n="57">With an oath King Olaf spoke !</l>
       <l n="58">“ But rewards to his pursuer ! ”</l>
       <l n="59">And with wrath his face grew redder</l>
       <l n="60">Than his scarlet cloak .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="61">Straight the master-builder , smiling ,</l>
       <l n="62">Answered thus the angry King :</l>

       <l n="64">Olaf , it was Thorberg Skafting</l>
       <l n="65">Who has done this thing ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="66">Then he chipped and smoothed the planking ,</l>
       <l n="67">Till the King , delighted , swore ,</l>
       <l n="68">With much lauding and much thanking ,</l>
       <l n="69">“ Handsomer is now my Dragon</l>
       <l n="70">Than she was before ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="71">Seventy ells and four extended</l>
       <l n="72">On the grass the vessel 's keel ;</l>
       <l n="73">High above it , gilt and splendid ,</l>
       <l n="74">Rose the figure-head ferocious</l>
       <l n="75">With its crest of steel .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="76">Then they launched her from the tressels ,</l>
       <l n="77">In the ship-yard by the sea ;</l>
       <l n="78">She was the grandest of all vessels ,</l>
       <l n="79">Never ship was built in Norway</l>
       <l n="80">Half so fine as she !</l>

       <l n="83">They who to the Saga listened</l>
       <l n="84">Heard the name of Thorberg Skafting</l>
