     <head>PROOF THAT SHAKSPERE COULD NOT WRITE</head>
     <p>No handwriting of Shakspere has ever been discovered except five autographs . In March 1613 , when he was nearly 49 years old , he signed his name to a mortgage , and again to a deed relative to the same transaction . Three years later he subscribed his name to three briefs or sheets of his will . The five facsimiles are here reproduced :</p>
     <p>They are all such signatures as an illiterate person , unaccustomed to write , would be likely to scrawl ; and</p>
     <note>4</note>
     <p>they are so different that an acquaintance with one is little help to the recognition of another .</p>
     <p>In the first signature he writes Wm . for William .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">The second and third autographs have William written above Shakspere .</l>
       <l n="2">Who but an illiterate person would sign his name thus ?</l>
     </lg>
     <p>In the last two signatures ( being told perhaps that his name ought to be written on one line ) he puts William before Shakspere ; but the fourth William reads Willin .</p>
     <p>See now how differently each letter is formed in the name Shakspere , beginning with the initial :</p>
     <p>Did anybody ever write the first letter of his name so differently ? After four attempts to form a capital S he succeeds tolerably well the fifth time . The second S , though of singular shape , appears to have been a customary one as early as 1598 . ( See examples of that year below . ) Shakspere 's first attempt to form the crooked letter is a failure , but the second passably good . So again in 1616 , when he has a different form to copy , his first attempt is futile , the second is passable , and the third quite successful .</p>
     <p>But in attempting the next letter he makes it worse every time :</p>
     <p>With the letter a he is more successful , making it legible three times out of five :</p>
     <note>5</note>
     <p>But the attempt to form a k is a signal failure :</p>
     <p>With the long s he succeeds best the first time , and worst the second and third :</p>
     <p>The letter p is legible the first time , but grows worse and worse to the last :</p>
     <p>It seems as if in the first attempt to sign his name in 1613 he thought it was complete when he made it end with sp e ; but being reminded that it lacked a letter or two he undertook to add one by putting an a over the e thus :</p>
     <p>The next time , which was probably the same day , ( 1 ) he seems to have written his name Shaksper , though the terminal letters are uncertain :</p>
     <p>The third time he gets it more like Shakspoze :</p>
     <p>The deed to Shakspere and two other trustees is dated March 10 and signed Henry Walker . The mortgage from Shakspere and the other trustees is dated March 11 . But for some unaccountable reason a duplicate verbatim copy of the deed from Henry Walker is signed by William Shakspere . This duplicate is in the Library of the city of London ; the mortgage is in the British Museum . The duplicate deed we suspect was signed after the mortgage . Hence the improvement in the autograph ; it was probably Shakspere 's second attempt to write . Compare it with the third .</p>
     <note>6</note>
     <p>The fourth time he seems to have tried to disguise the termination with awkward flourishes , making the letters totally illegible :</p>
     <p>Finally , he omits the flourishes and comes nearer legibility , but still it is impossible to tell whether he meant to write ear , ere , or eare :</p>
     <p>And now let the reader mark , that notwithstanding the orthodox spelling of the name from 1593 to 1616 , and indeed up to the present time , was and is Shakespeare , there is no e in the first syllable and no a in the last , although some have imagined the letter a to exist in the last part of the final autograph .</p>
     <p>We have said that these signatures are all that . Shakspere is known to have written ; we ought to add that he prefixed to the last one the following scrawl :</p>
     <p>For a long time we puzzled over this . Could it be an attempt to write “ 25th of March , ” the day of the execution of the will ? At last we read the following in Hallowell-Phillipps 's Shakspere :</p>
     <p>“ It may be observed that the words By me , which , the autograph excepted , are the only ones in the poet 's handwriting known to exist , appear to have been penned with ordinary firmness . ”</p>
     <p>Presuming that the signatures were made in a sick bed , the author concedes that the words “ By me ” were penned with ordinary firmness . Very good ; but could not almost any five-year-old boy do as well the first time ?</p>
     <note>7</note>
     <p>In 1775 certain papers and legal instruments were published , attributed to Shakspere , Queen Elizabeth , and Southampton . In 1796 Edmund Malone proved them to be forgeries . Here is one of the forged autographs of Shakspere :</p>
     <p>This is superior to any of the genuine ones , which in some degree it resembles . The letter a is pretty clearly written in the last syllable , as if the forger meant to establish the proper spelling of that part of the name . Malone , who at first pronounced the genuine orthography to be Shakspeare , subsequently declared Shakspere to be the poet 's own mode of spelling his name beyond all doubt . But others do not accede to this decision , because they think there is an a in the last of the five genuine signatures .</p>
     <p>The solution of the whole mystery is in the fact that Shakspere was unable to write or even to spell his own name .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">In 1598 Richard Quiney addressed a letter to him asking for a loan of</l>
       <l n="2">L30 , and the name was written Shackesper :</l>

     <p>was peculiar to that time . It occurs in Shakspere 's second autograph . Why did he thus vary the form ? Probably because he followed the copy set for him .</p>
     <p>Note now the various spellings of his name :</p>
     <p>In 1582 , as a bridegroom , Shagsper .</p>
     <p>In 1593 and 1594 , as a poet , Shakespeare ; and the same uniformly as a playwright from 1598 to 1623. but sometimes with a hyphen — Shake-speare .</p>
     <p>In 1596 , as an inhabitant of Southwark , Shaksper .</p>
     <p>In 1598 , as addressed by letter , Shackesper .</p>
     <p>In 1598 , as owner of corn , Shakesper .</p>
     <p>In 1604 , as plaintiff in a suit , Shexpere .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>In 1616 , as twice written in his will , Shackspeare ; but in signing the same three times he omits the c in the first syllable , and it is impossible to tell what the last three or four letters are . And although in the two Deeds of 1613 the name is written repeatedly Shakespeare , in signing them he omits the e in the first syllable both times , and varies the termination of the name , just as an illiterate person would be likely to do .</p>
     <p>But there are more of these various spellings . All the records of Shakspere 's lifetime have been hunted up and printed . From these documents , consisting of deeds , bills of complaint , letters , poems , plays , etc .,— most of which especially concerned either the father or son or both — we extract the following spellings , giving ; the dates :</p>

     </lg>
     <p>Mr. C. F. Gunther , of Chicago , claims to have obtained a copy of the Shakspere Folio of 1632 , ( i. e ., the second Folio ,) containing the author 's autograph pasted on a fly-leaf , underneath which is written :</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ The works of William Shakespeare . Born in April , 1564 , and died in</l>
       <l n="2">April , 1616 . John Ward . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>And on the same fly-leaf is pasted a letter from Charles Godwin , of Bath , dated February 16 , 1839 , to Dr. Charles Severn , of London , who was then editing “ The Diary of the Rev . John Ward , A. M ., ” Vicar of Stratford-upon-Avon from 1648 to 1679 .</p>
     <p>The book is said to have been owned by a Mormon , and is supposed to have been brought from England by an emigrant to Utah . Aside from the impossibility of such an autograph escaping from England to the wilds of America and remaining undiscovered so many years , the fac-simile in the Chicago Current of May 23 , 1885 , betrays most certain evidence of fraud . Compare it with the five genuine scrawls of Shakspere . It is so exact a copy of the last signature to the will as to indicate that it was traced therefrom .</p>
     <p>Shakspere 's last signature :</p>
     <p>Pretended autograph in Chicago :</p>
     <note>11</note>
     <p>This close resemblance in so clumsy an autograph would be extraordinary , if not impossible ; but how easy to forge it by first tracing it lightly with a pencil and then completing it with a pen . Here is a hair-line tracing of the spurious over the genuine autograph :</p>
     <p>Even the most illiterate man who is obliged often to sign his name , will do it uniformly , so that when you have seen his signature once you will know it again . For example , take the following autographs :</p>
     <p>The undersigned , aged 78 years , wrote the above autographs in presence of the two subscribing witnesses . And he never wrote and cannot write anything but his name , though he can read print with ease . And he further says that he learned to write his name in the course of one month in the administration of President Polk ( 1845 - ‘ 9 ) while serving as a Capitol policeman ; otherwise he would have been obliged to sign the pay-roll with his cross .</p>

     <head>NO TRUE LIKENESS OF SHAKSPERE</head>
     <p>The likeness of Shakspere in the Folio of 1623 has frequently been called “ an abominable libel on humanity . ” And yet its fidelity is certified by Ben Jonson in laudatory lines . Jonson was Bacon 's friend and enthusiastic admirer . If there was an original portrait of that wooden face it has never been found . If there was a better likeness of Shakspere in existence why was it not reproduced in that famous Folio ? The same ugly engraving reappeared in all the later editions up tu 1685 .</p>
     <p>The bust on the monument at Stratford was first noticed in 1623 . It was not taken from life , and is unlike any picture of Shakspere . It presents him in the act of composition , and “ the vis comica ” , says Boaden , “ so broadens his countenance , that it is hardly a stretch of fancy to suppose him in the actual creation of Falstaff himself . ” More likely , we should say , Falltaff was Shakspere — Fall-staff , Shake-spear .</p>
     <p>The most familiar pictures of Shakspere are very different from either of these , and generally far more intellectual and refined . They are pretended copies of what is called the Chandos portrait , but are not much like it . The Chandos picture was painted by an unknown artist , and has been altered by a later hand . It is said to have been owned by Sir William Davenant , who died in 1668 ; and he is said to have obtained it from an actor named Joseph Taylor , who died about 1653 at the age of 70 . This we gather from Boaden 's “ Portraits of Shakspere , ” 1824 . But now comes a further statement purporting to be written in Mr. Gunther 's Folio , by one Charles Lomax ,, in 1781 , as follows :</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ The only original picture now extant of Shakespeare was painted by</l>
       <l n="2">Joseph Taylor , one of the actors , ” &amp; c .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The rest of the pretended information agrees with what we find in Boaden 's book , which has a picture taken from the Chandos portrait quite different from those we generally see , and not much like the Droeshout engraving in the Shakspere Folio .</p>
     <p>Shakspere probably never had a portrait taken .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>The first published poem of Shakspere , so far as known , was “ Venus and Adonis , ” in 1593 . It was dedicated to the Earl of Southampton , then about twenty years of age . Five or six editions were called for in nine years . The “ Sonnets ” did not appear till 1609 . The latter poem has 154 stanzas of 14 lines each ; the first 126 are addressed to a beautiful and ardently beloved youth ; the remainder to the young man 's betrothed .</p>
     <p>As to the merits of the composition , the American Cyclopedia says :</p>
     <p>“ These ‘ Sonnets , ’ though deformed with occasional conceits , far surpass all other poems of their kind in our own language , or perhaps any other . ”</p>
     <p>The dedication is in these words :</p>
     <p>“ To the onlie begetter of | these insuing Sonnets | Mr. W. H. all happinesse | and that eternitie | promised by | our everliving poet | wisheth | the well-wishing | adventurer in | setting forth | T. T . ”</p>
     <note>14</note>
     <p>Some have believed that “ Mr. W. H . ” was William Herbert ; and a German critic supposes the initials to signify “ William Himself . ” But the American Cyclopedia says :</p>
     <p>“ To whom they were written , and in whose person is among the most difficult of unsolved literary problems .... Who this ‘ onlie begetter ’ was no man has yet been able satisfactorily to show . "( 1 )</p>
     <p>( 1 ) Dr. Charles Mackay attempts to solve the problem in an elaborate article in the Nineteenth Century , August , 1884 , entitled “ A Tangled Skein Unravelled . ” He claims only to have found indications of mixed authorship . But this only makes the tangle worse , which began with Shakspere 's ostensible authorship ; and the last despairing words of the astute un-raveller are : “ All is supposition , the mystery is insoluble . ”</p>
     <p>In regard to the hypothesis that “ W. H . ” was William Herbert , the same authority says there is almost as much ground for the notion that the person addressed was Queen Elizabeth in doublet and hose .</p>
     <p>In 1872 we first read Nathaniel Holmes 's “ Authorship of Shakspere ; ” since then we have never entertained a reasonable doubt that Bacon was the author of the Plays . In 1882 we reread them all in the light of that discovery ; but until July 31 , 1883 , we had never read a page of the “ Sonnets , ” nor when we began to read them on that day did we remember to have heard who “ W. H . ” was supposed to be . But coming to the twenty-fifth sonnet , we suspected that the poem was addressed to the Earl of Essex , and subsequent research confirmed that suspicion .</p>
     <p>Herbert was sixteen years younger than Shakspere , and nineteen years younger than Bacon . If , therefore , the poem was written in 1590 , which we purpose to show , it is impossible for Herbert to have been the</p>
     <note>15</note>
     <p>“ onlie begetter of these Sonnets , ” for he was then only ten years old .</p>
     <p>Of course no one will date their composition as late as 1609 , when Shakspere was forty-five and Bacon forty-eight . At that time the former had retired from the stage , and Bacon had been for six years King 's counsel and three years a married man . And certainly two sonnets ( 138 and 144 ) were composed as early as 1599 , for they are repeated at the beginning of “ The Passionate Pilgrim , ” which was first published in that year .</p>
     <p>All the internal and external evidence points to the year 1590 as the date , Francis Bacon as the writer , and the Earl of Essex as the person addressed .</p>
     <p>It is said that Bacon made the acquaintance of Essex about 1590 , but it would be remarkable if he did not know him years before . In sonnet 104 the poet says :</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ Three winters cold</l>
       <l n="2">Have from the forests shook three summers ’ pride ,</l>
       <l n="3">Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned</l>
       <l n="4">In process of the seasons have I seen ,</l>
       <l n="5">Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned ,</l>
       <l n="6">Since first I saw you fresh , which yet are green . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Let us suppose that Bacon began to cultivate the Earl 's friendship in 1590 . He was then twenty-two years old ; three years earlier , when Bacon first saw him , the Earl was “ fresh now he is yet green . "( 1 )</p>
     <p>1 . A letter from Bacon to the Earl of Leicester , asking for his furtherance in some suit which the Earl of Essex had moved in his behalf , has recently been found , written in 1588 . ( Sped-ding 's “ Bacon , ” 1878 , i , 50 , note . )</p>
     <p>Robert Devereux , the second Earl of Essex , was born Nov. 10 , 1567 , and was beheaded for treason</p>
     <note>16</note>
     <p>Feb. 25 , 1601 . He succeeded to the title at ten years of age . At twenty he was appointed master of the horse . At twenty-one the Queen created him captain-general of the cavalry , and conferred on him the honor of the garter . In the same year an expedition was undertaken against Portugal , and he secretly followed the armament . This was without the Queen 's permission , but he was quickly reconciled with her after his return , and at once assumed a superiority over Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir Charles Blount , rival competitors for royal favor . He was challenged by Blount and wounded in the knee , and the Queen is said to have expressed her gratification that some one had taken him down , as otherwise there would be no ruling him . He was an accomplished scholar and patron of literature . He erected a monument to Spenser and gave an estate to Bacon .</p>
     <p>But we have omitted one striking characteristic which has an important bearing on the question of his identity with “ Mr. W. H . ” The young Earl of Essex was a remarkably handsome man . Now the beauty of the person addressed in the “ Sonnets ” is a constantly recurring theme , and the burden of the poem is an appeal to the beloved and beautiful young man to marry . It begins thus :</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ From fairest creatures we desire increase ,</l>
       <l n="2">That thereby beauty 's rose might never die . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">The next Sonnet begins :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="4">“ When forty winters shall besiege thy brow ,</l>
       <l n="5">And dig deep trenches in thy beauty 's field ,</l>
       <l n="6">Thy youth 's proud livery , so gazed on now ,</l>
       <l n="7">Will be a tattered weed of small worth held . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="8">The last line of Sonnet 13 reads :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="9">“ You had a father ; let your son say so . ”</l>

     <p>The father of Essex died in 1576 . In 1590 the second Earl married the widow of Sir Philip Sidney , Essex being twenty-two years old and she a little younger . The marriage was secret to avoid the opposition of Elizabeth . By October , concealment was no longer possible , and on the 22d of January , 1591 , ( not 1592 as some have it ,) the first child was born . ( “ Earls of Essex , ” 1853 . )</p>
     <p>The mother of Essex was celebrated for her beauty ; his father was not handsome . ( See portrait in “ Earls of Essex . ” ) The son 's inheritance of his mother 's features is told in the third Sonnet :</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Thou art thy mother 's glass , and she in thee</l>
       <l n="2">Calls back the lovely April of her prime ;</l>

       <l n="4">Despite of wrinkles , this thy golden time . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">For further description of the young Earl 's beauty , take the following :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="6">“ If I could write the beauty of your eyes ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="14">Essex having become the special favorite of the Queen , of course became</l>
       <l n="15">an object of envy and slander . Mark now what the poet says :</l>

       <l n="16">“ Gentle thou art , and therefore to be won ;</l>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>In 1590 Bacon had acquired a reputation as an orator in the House of Commons , but was without available means of livelihood in keeping with his wants and station . Up to this time his efforts for promotion were thwarted by the Queen 's minister , Lord Burleigh ( Cecil ) who regarded him as a dangerous rival for his son . With the rise of young Essex into royal favor Bacon turned to him as a friend at court . From 1590 to 1594 the Earl tried in vain to advance Bacon , and at last , when the vacant office of Attorney General was filled by another , Essex , blaming himself for the disappointment , insisted on presenting him with an estate worth L1 , 800 .</p>
     <p>With these facts in mind , see how perfectly the following lines fit the persons and the time , 1590 :</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Let those who are in favor with their stars ,</l>
       <l n="2">Of public honor and proud titles boast ,</l>

       <l n="7">And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries ,</l>
       <l n="8">And look upon myself and curse my fate ,</l>
       <l n="9">Wishing me like to one more rich in hope .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="10">Featured like him , like him with friends possessed ,</l>

       <l n="12">With what I most enjoy contented least ;</l>
       <l n="13">Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising ,</l>
       <l n="14">Haply I think on thee , and then my state ,</l>
       <l n="15">Like to the lark at break of day arising ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="37">In 1590 Shakspere was part owner of a theater .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>In 1590 Bacon obtained his first show of favor from the court ; he became Queen 's counsel extraordinary , but the office was without emolument . At this time plays for the theater were written and rewritten again and again to meet the demand . Young lawyers and poets produced them rapidly . Each theatrical company kept from one to four poets in its pay ( Amer . Cyc . ) Shakspere appeared to be ready to father anything that promised success , and there are at least six plays published under his name or initials which most critics say are not his , nor have they ever appeared in the genuine canon . In 1591 a poem by Spenser was published containing these lines :</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ And he , the man whom Nature 's self has made</l>
       <l n="2">To mock herself and truth to imitate ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">With kindly counter under mimic shade :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="4">“ Our pleasant Willy , ah , is dead of late :</l>
       <l n="5">With whom all joy and jolly merriment</l>
       <l n="6">Is also deaded and in dolor drent . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="7"><span type="note_anchor">[ 20 ]</span></l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>From 1590 until Shakspere retired from the stage , how could it be said that he was “ poor , ” bewailing his “ outcast state ” and “ cursing his fate ? ” But it is certain that Bacon 's condition answered precisely to that description up to November , 1594 , when Essex gave him an estate worth L1 , 800 ; aye , even until 1604 , when King James granted him a pension of L60 ; if not even up to 1607 .</p>
     <p>Mark now the modesty of the poet in 1590 :</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ If thou survive my well contented day ,</l>
       <l n="2">When that churl Death with bones my dust shall cover ,</l>
       <l n="3">And shalt by fortune once more resurvey</l>
       <l n="4">These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover ,</l>
       <l n="5">Compare them with the bettering of the time ,</l>
       <l n="6">And though they be outstripp 'd by every pen ,</l>
       <l n="7">Reserve them for thy love , not for their rhyme ,</l>
       <l n="8">Exceeded by the height of happier men . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ My name be buried Where my body is , and live no more to shame nor me nor you , for I am shamed by that which I bring forth , and so should you , to love things nothing worth . ”</p>
     <p>We have already quoted a verse from Spenser in praise of “ Willy , ” first published in 1591 ; we now adduce a passage from one of “ Willy ” Bacon 's poems first published in 1599 in praise of Spenser :</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Dowland to thee is dear , whose heavenly touch</l>
       <l n="2">Upon the lute doth ravish human sense ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">Spenser to me , whose deep conceit is such</l>
       <l n="4">As , passing all conceit , needs no defense . ”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>This verse is in “ The Passionate Pilgrim , ” the first two numbers of which are Sonnets 138 and 144 with slight variations . John Dowland , a musician , was born</p>
     <note>21</note>
     <p>in 1562 and died 1625 . Spenser was eight years older than Bacon .</p>
     <p>But coupled with this modesty of the author of the “ Sonnets , ” note how he praises his friend and how famous that friend appears at the time :</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Oh , how I faint when I of you do write ,</l>
       <l n="2">Knowing a better spirit doth use your name ,</l>
       <l n="3">And in the praise thereof spends all his might ,</l>
       <l n="4">To make me tongue-tied , speaking of your fame .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">But since your worth , wide as the ocean is ,</l>
       <l n="6">The humble as the proudest sail doth bear ,</l>
       <l n="7">My saucy bark , inferior far to his ,</l>
       <l n="8">On your broad main doth wilfully appear ;</l>
       <l n="9">Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat ,</l>
       <l n="10">Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride ;</l>
       <l n="11">Or being wrecked , I am a worthless boat ,</l>
       <l n="12">He of tall building and of goodly pride ;</l>
       <l n="13">Then if he thrive and I be cast away ,</l>
       <l n="14">The worst was this : my love was my decay . ”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>The other superior (? ) poet referred to is undoubtedly Spenser , among whose “ Sonnets , addressed by the author to his friends and patrons , ” in January , 1590 , is one “ To the most honorable and excellent Lord the Earl of Essex , great master of the horse to her highness , and knight of the noble order of the garter , etc . ” Essex became master of the horse in 1587 , and knight of the garter in 1588 .</p>
     <p>We proceed with the quotations from the Shaksperian Sonnets :</p>

     <p>Incidentally it may be noted how familiar the writer of the above lines must have been with the practice of law . Shakspere 's legal knowledge has amazed the lawyers .</p>
     <p>The next Sonnet introduces the name of “ Will , ” and puns upon it profusely :</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Whoever hath her wish thou hast thy Will ,</l>
       <l n="2">And Will to boot , and Will in overplus ;</l>
       <l n="3">More than enough am I that vex thee still ,</l>
       <l n="4">To thy sweet will making addition thus ,</l>
       <l n="5">Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious ,</l>
       <l n="6">Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">Shall will in others seem right gracious ,</l>
       <l n="8">And in my will no fair acceptance shine ?</l>
       <l n="9">The sea , all water , yet receives rain still ,</l>
       <l n="10">And in abundance addeth to his store :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="11">So thou being rich in Will add to thy Will</l>
       <l n="12">One will of mine , to make thy large Will more .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">Let no unkind , no fair beseechers kill ;</l>
       <l n="14">Think all but one , and me in that one Will . ”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>How preposterous to believe that a common-place play actor , with a wife and children , addressed such sentiments to the bride of his dearest friend ! At no time do the sentiments or circumstances of the poem fit the person of the actor , of whom the dying and dissipated playwright , Greene , wrote in 1592 :</p>
     <p>“ There is an upstart crow beautified with our feathers that with his Tygers heart , wrapt in a player 's hide , supposes he is as well able to bumbast out a blank verse as the best of you ; and being an absolute Johannes factotum , is , in his owne conceyt , the onely Shake-scene in a countne . ”</p>
     <p>But , on the other hand , frequent evidence appears that Bacon , up to the time he was made Attorney-General in 1613 , was constantly engaged in secret literary work . But not so secret as to be unknown</p>
     <note>24</note>
     <p>to a circle of friends and perchance a few enemies ; for , in 1599 , when he interceded with the Queen for his dear friend Essex , then under arrest on account of a treasonable pamphlet being dedicated to him , her Majesty flung at Bacon “ a matter which grew from him , but went after about in others ’ names , ” being in fact the play of “ Richard II , ” which , in that and the preceding year , had a great run on the stage , and had gone through two editions , but , for prudential reasons , with the scene containing the deposition of the king left out .</p>
     <p>But even in the “ Sonnets ” the fact appears that the author has been writing for the stage :</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Alas , ‘ tis true I have gone here and there ,</l>
       <l n="2">And made myself a motley to the view ,</l>
       <l n="3">Gored mine own thoughts , sold cheap what is most dear ,</l>
       <l n="4">Made old offenses of affections new ;</l>
       <l n="5">Most true it is that I have looked on truth</l>
       <l n="6">Askance and strangely ; but by all above ,</l>
       <l n="7">These blenches gave my heart another youth ,</l>
       <l n="8">And worse essays proved thee my best of love . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="9">“ O , for my sake do you with Fortune chide ,</l>
       <l n="10">The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds ,</l>
       <l n="11">That did not better for my life provide</l>
       <l n="12">Than public means which public manners breeds .</l>
       <l n="13">Thence comes it that my name receives a brand ,</l>
       <l n="14">And almost thence my nature is subdued</l>
       <l n="15">To what it works in , like the dyer 's hand :</l>
       <l n="16">Pity me then and wish I were renewed . ”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Here is not only a private confession of being compelled to produce plays for subsistence , but a sorrowful acknowledgment that thereby his “ name receives a brand . ”</p>
     <p>Yet it must not be supposed that Bacon was publicly known at any time as a play writer . His first</p>
     <note>25</note>
     <p>publication , the “ Essays , ” was in 1597 , and Shakspere 's name first appeared on the title page of a Play in 1598 , by which time nearly half of the Plays had been written or sketched , and six had been printed , all without the author 's name . And when the first collection was published in the “ Folio ” of 1623 , ( seven years after Shakspere 's death ,) it included some Plays never before heard of , and eighteen never before printed .</p>
     <p>Lord Coke , who was Bacon 's most jealous rival and adversary , seems never to have suspected him of play writing . Nor did the watchful Puritanic mother of the two bachelors of Gray 's Inn ever dream that her studious younger son was engaged in such sinful work .</p>
     <p>In Sonnet 76 the writer deplores his want of variety of style , and fears that this fault will almost disclose his secret authorship :</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ Why is my verse so barren of new pride ,</l>
       <l n="2">So far from variation or quick change ?</l>
       <l n="3">Why with the time do I not glance aside ,</l>
       <l n="4">To new-found methods and to compounds strange ?</l>
       <l n="5">Why write I still all one , ever the same ,</l>
       <l n="6">And keep invention in a noted weed ,</l>
       <l n="7">That every word doth almost tell my name ,</l>
       <l n="8">Showing their birth and where they did proceed ? ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Bacon having begun to produce plays for Shakspere 's theater before 1590 , the authorship of which was afterward assumed by the actor and proprietor , it became necessary also to avoid being publicly known as a writer of sonnets . Therefore , in view of the circulation and ultimate publication of this poem , he facetiously disguised the identity of the writer by calling himself “ Will . ” Three years later he dedicated a</p>
     <note>26</note>
     <p>published poem to his young friend Southampton under the name of “ William Shakespeare , ” and again another in 1594 . But the “ Sonnets ” were not published until 1609 , when Essex had been dead eight years , and his widow had been married six years to a third husband . It would never do for the Solicitor-General to be known as the author of such a poem ; so when it came out in print it was dedicated to “ Mr. W. H . ” by “ T. T ., ” and no one until a few years ago ever seems to have suspected that Bacon wrote the poem , nor , so far as we are aware , has any one ever suspected until July 31 , 1883 , that “ W. H . ” was the accomplished and famous Earl of Essex .</p>
     <p>The young widow Sidney was the only daughter of the Queen 's principal secretary , Sir Francis Walsingham , for whom Bacon drafted an important state paper in 1588 on the conduct of the government toward Papists and Dissenters . And that Bacon was intimate with the Secretary 's daughter , aye , even one of her lovers , appears from many of the Sonnets addressed to her . He describes her playing on the harpsichord , envies the keys “ that nimbly leap to kiss her hand , ” and says :</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Since saucy jacks so happy are in this ,</l>
       <l n="2">Give them thy fingers , me thy lips to kiss . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">And from other passages it is quite evident that he had often kissed</l>
       <l n="4">her .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>No fact has been found incompatible with Bacon 's authorship of the “ Sonnets . ” The following line might seem to indicate a writer past the age of 29 :</p>
     <p>“ Although she knows my days are past the best . ”</p>
     <p>But in 1599 , when Shakspere was only 35 , this very verse was published as his in the “ Passionate Pilgrim , ” where Sonnet 138 appears as number one .</p>
     <note>27</note>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">But again , we have a letter written in 1592 by Bacon to his uncle , Lord</l>
       <l n="2">Treasurer Burleigh , in which he says :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">“ I wax somewhat ancient ; one and thirty years is a great deal of sand in</l>
       <l n="4">the hour-glass . ”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>At the age of 31 he thinks himself “ somewhat ancient ” two years earlier he apprehends that forty winters will entirely deface the youthful Earl 's beauty ; and to the lovely young widow he says : “ My days are past the best . ”</p>
     <p>This misconception therefore , whether pretended or real , becomes a strong proof of Bacon 's authorship .</p>
     <p>It has been boldly alleged by some that Bacon was no poet . Such , however , was not the judgment of his biographer , the late James Spedding . Before he could have heard it claimed that Shakspere did not write the plays he said that Bacon might have taken the highest rank as a poet . And that judgment was based upon the versification of a few Psalms by the old man on a sick bed . Since 1867 the substantial proofs of Bacon 's secret authorship have been adduced . Aside from innumerable parallels in the works of Bacon and Shakspere there is much external evidence . For example :</p>
     <p>We know that Bacon wrote Sonnets to Queen Elizabeth and excused himself by saying : “ I profess not to be a poet . ”</p>
     <p>We know that he composed Masques anonymously before Shakspere 's name appeared as a play writer , and that those Masques were essentially poetical compositions , in the nature of plays , and sometimes contained verses in rhyme equal in merit to the average of Shakspere 's .</p>
     <note>28</note>
     <p>In one of those Masques a speaker is made to say : “ The monuments of wit survive the monuments of power ; the verses of the poet endure without a syllable lost , while states and empires pass many periods . ” Two years later , in 1596 , the composer of that speech , writing to Sir Fulke Greville on his studies , said : “ For poets I can commend none , being resolved to be ever a stranger to them . ” Greville ( 1554-1628 ) was a poet , and wrote the life of Sir Philip Sidney .</p>
     <p>In 1603 Bacon wrote a private letter to the poet John Davies , begging him to speak a good word for the writer to the incoming King James I ., and closing with these words : “ So , desiring you to be good to concealed poets , I continue . ”</p>
     <p>Bacon 's most intimate friend , Toby Matthew , in a letter with cancelled date , but as late as 1605 , acknowledged the receipt of some work by Bacon , and added this postscript :</p>
     <p>“ I will not return you weight for weight , but Measure for Measure . ”</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ Mesur for Mesur , ” by “ Shaxberd , ” was played before King James , at</l>
       <l n="2">Whitehall , December 26 , 1604 .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Again , about the time of the publication of the Shakespere Folio , 1623 , Matthew acknowledged in a letter without date , the receipt of a “ great and noble favor , ” and added the following :</p>
     <p>“ P. S .— The most prodigious wit that ever I knew , of my nation and of this side of the sea , is of your Lordship 's name , though he be known by another . ”</p>

      <head>BACON IDENTIFIED AS THE CONCEALED POET IGNOTO</head>

       <l n="5">Harvey ,) “ R. S ., ” “ H. B ., ” “ W. L ., ” and “ Ignoto , ” are prefixed to</l>
       <l n="6">Spenser 's work .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>In 1599 “ The Passionate Pilgrim , ” a collection of twenty-one sonnets , songs , etc ., was published with the name of W. Shakspere on the title page . The authorship of several of the pieces is disputed .</p>
     <p>In regard to No . xviii . “ My flocks feed not , ” Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps , says :</p>
     <p>“ There is a somewhat brief version of this song in the collection of Madrigals , etc ., by Thomas Weelkes 1597 , this person being the composer of the music , but not necessarily the author of the words . A copy of it as it is seen in the Passionate Pilgrim also occurs in England 's Helicon , 1600 , entitled ‘ The Unknowne Sheepheards Complaint , ’ and is there subscribed Ignoto . ”</p>
     <p>Again , in regard to No . xx , “ Live with me and be my love , ” the same author , says :</p>
     <p>“ The first of these very pretty songs is incomplete , and the second , called ‘ Love 's answer , ’ still more so . In England 's Helicon , 1600 , the former is given to Marlowe , the latter to Ignoto ; and there is good reason to believe that Christopher</p>
     <note>30</note>
     <p>Marlowe wrote the song , and Sir Walter Raleigh the nymph 's reply ; for so we are positively assured by Isaac Walton , who has inserted them both in his Complete Angler under the character of ‘ that smooth song which was made by Kit Marlowe , now at least fifty years ago ; and an answer to it which was made by Sir Walter Raleigh in his younger days :— old fashioned poetry but choicely good . ’ Both these songs were exceedingly popular and are afterwards found in the street ballads . The first is quoted in the Merry Wives of Windsor . ”</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Again , in regard to No . xxi , “ As it fell upon a day , ” Mr .</l>
       <l n="2">Halliwell-Phillipps , says :</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ This charming idyl occurs , with the absence of two lines , amongst the Poems in Divers Humours appended to Bamfield 's Encomion of Lady Pecunia , in 1598 , and the first twenty-six lines with the addition of two new ones are found in England 's Helicon , 1600 . This latter version follows in that work No . xviii of this list , [ “ My flocks feed not , ” ] is also subscribed Ignoto , and is headed : ‘ Another of the same Sheepheards . ’ The probability is that the copies of these little poems , as given in the Helicon , were taken from a Common Place book in which the names of the authors were not recorded ; the two supplementary lines just noticed having the appearance of being an unauthorized couplet improvised for the sake of giving a neater finish to the abridgment . ”</p>
     <p>We will now reproduce the aforesaid poems from “ England 's Helicon , ” second edition , 1614 . A brief version of the first song , No . xviii of “ The Passionate Pilgrim , ” says Halliwell-Phillipps , appeared in 1597 :</p>

     <p>The last two lines , Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps says , are new ones added to the first twenty-six in “ The Passionate Pilgrim . ” Our own edition of the latter has those two lines , and the only variation is in the tenth line — “ up-till ” for “ against . ” There are thirty lines more in our edition . But we have another version of the whole , omitting the aforesaid two lines and a subsequent couplet . This version , curiously enough , is</p>
     <note>33</note>
     <p>Leaded “ Address to the Nightingale , ” and is credited to Richard Barnfield , “ about 1610 . ” ( Encyc . of Poetry No . 121 . ) In 1598 it is said that the first twenty-six lines of this idyl appeared in an appendix to Barnfield 's “ Encomium in 1599 it reappeared enlarged to twice the length and was credited to Shakspere ; in 1600 the first twenty-eight lines were republished in “ England 's Helicon ” and subscribed “ Ignoto . ”</p>
     <p>We now transcribe from the “ Helicon , ” No . xx of “ The Passionate Pilgrim ” much amended and enlarged :</p>

     <p>( 1 ) The grammar of this verse is shocking both here and in the version of 1599 . And there are considerable variations in the two versions . In that of 1599 the first word “ Come ” is omitted , without which the song could hardly be sung . Other slight defects of measure appear in both . But the editor of Marlowe 's Works has carefully corrected the grammar and the measure .</p>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Here we have Marlowe credited with this song in 1600 , seven years after his death . Is there any other evidence that he wrote it ? A single line at the close of a ditty in his “ Jew of Malta ” parallels with the first line of this , except the first word :</p>
     <p>“ Shall live with me and be my love . ”</p>
     <p>The song , with many verbal amendments , and omitting the last stanza , is inserted in his “ Works , ” 1826 .</p>
     <p>In the “ Merry Wives of Windsor ” act iii , scene ly Sir Hugh Evans sings the following four lines :</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ To shallow rivers , to whose falls</l>
       <l n="2">Melodious birds sing madrigals ;</l>
       <l n="3">There we will make our peds of roses ,</l>
       <l n="4">And a thousand fragrant posies . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">This play was written in the latter part of 1599 . In the earliest form</l>
       <l n="6">of it Sir Hugh transposes and varies the lines thus :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="7">“ And then she made him beds of roses ,</l>
       <l n="8">And a thousand fragrant posies . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="9">Then after three lines of incoherent speech :</l>

       <l n="11">Melodious birds sing madrigals . ”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>It would seem as if the song was familiar to the public in 1599 We now add from the “ Helicon ” the rest of No . xx of “ The Passionate Pilgrim , ” enlarged from one stanza to six :</p>

     <p>What could Walton know about it fifty years after the publication of the song and answer as above ? On such worthless testimony the Nymph 's Answer is credited to Raleigh . And we have in the “ Encyclopedia of Poetry , ” 1873 , first the song by Marlowe , “ about 1590 , ” and then the Nymph 's Reply by Raleigh “ about 1610 . ” Strange that the Nymph should wait about twenty years to reply , and should then repeat the lines credited to Shakspere in 1599 and to “ Ignoto ” in 1600 ! The song perhaps existed before the death of Marlowe in 1593 , but was probably composed by “ Ignoto , ” who also wrote “ The Nymph 's Reply ” and numerous other poetical pieces that were published in the “ Helicon ” in 1600 .</p>
     <p>“ Ignoto ” was undoubtedly a concealed poet . Marlowe , Raleigh and Barnfield were not . As early as January 1590 , if not a little sooner , “ Ignoto ” contributed to Spenser 's first publication of the “ Faery Queen ” the following lines :</p>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Compare this with the following lines from Spenser 's “ Colin Clout , ” dedicated to Sir Walter Raleigh , December 27 , 1591 , and published in 1595 :</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ And there is Corydon , though meanly waged ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="5">he not a concealed poet ? Was he not “ Corydon ” ? Was he not “ Ignoto ” ?</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>But what evidence is there that Raleigh used that signature ? The “ Faery Queen ” was publicly dedicated to him , and in the Sonnet addressed to him as one of Spenser 's patrons , a forthcoming poem by Raleigh is announced thus :</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ Yet , till that thou thy poem wilt make known ,</l>
       <l n="2">Let thy fair Cynthia 's praises be thus rudely shown . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>That poem was known to Spenser , who in the Dedication said he had fashioned his Queen “ according to your [ Raleigh 's ] own excellent conceit of Cynthia , ” i. e ., Queen Elizabeth .</p>
     <p>Furthermore , Raleigh contributed two Sonnets in praise of Spenser 's “ Faery Queen ; ” these he subscribed with his own initials . Did he at the same time write another encomium and sign it “ Ignoto ” ?</p>
     <p>There are sixteen pieces in the “ Helicon ” subscribed “ Ignoto . ” One of these , “ The Nymph 's Reply ” is ascribed to Raleigh on the testimony of Walton in 1653 ; and two others are believed by the editor of the third edition , 1812 , to belong to Raleigh , because in an early copy of the same “ Ignoto ” was found pasted over “ W. R . ” Upon such flimsy evidence the modern editor infers that the signature “ Ignoto ” was “ generally , though not exclusively , ( his own italics ,) subscribed to the pieces of Sir Walter Raleigh . ”</p>
     <p>The next piece after “ The Nymph 's Reply ” in the “ Helicon ” is the following by “ Ignoto ":</p>

     <p>Similar parallels may be found with other lines of the song . Now are we to believe that Marlowe wrote the first song , and Raleigh the other two signed “ Ignoto ” ? Is it not far more rational and consistent to believe that all three were written by the same pen ?</p>
     <p>Again , Barnfield has two pieces in the “ Helicon , ” and the editor ascribes to him another signed “ Ignoto ” — No . xxi , “ As it fell upon a day ” — while Allibone , in his Dictionary of Authors , makes him the</p>
     <note>41</note>
     <p>author not only of xxi , but of xx — “ Come live with me and be my love ” — and says that Raleigh 's authorship of “ The Nymph 's Reply ” is questioned .</p>
     <p>Thus Marlowe is robbed of the only piece ascribed to him in the “ Helicon , ” and Raleigh is left out of it entirely , unless he wrote some other poem signed “ Ignoto . ”</p>
     <p>And by the way , poor neglected Shakspere has but a single specimen there — “ On a day , alack a day ” — taken from “ Love 's Labor Lost . ”</p>
     <p>But the confusion about “ Ignoto ” is still more confounded . On page 112 of the “ Helicon ” is a song entitled “ The Shepherd 's Dump , ” subscribed “ S. E. D ., ” supposed to mean Sir Edward Dyer , and on page 224 the same identical song reappears entitled “ Thirsis , the Shepherd , to his pipe , ” and signed “ Ignoto . ” The editor of 1812 supposes it was reprinted to make a few corrections in the last stanza ; but as the verbal variations in that stanza make it positively worse , it is more likely that the compiler did not notice the repetition , but inadvertently put both in as he found them .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">But even this is not all . In Ellis 's “ Specimens of the early English</l>
       <l n="2">Poets , ” 5th edition , 1845 , among the pieces credited to Fulke Greville</l>
       <l n="3">( Lord Brooke ) is a “ Song , ” with these words in brackets :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="4">“ To be found in ‘ England 's Helicon , ’ where it is signed Ignoto . ”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>On turning to the edition of 1614 we find that song entitled “ Another , of his Cynthia . ” It is preceded by two , evidently by the same pen , entitled , “ To his Flocks , ” and “ To his Love ” and is followed by still “ Another to his Cynthia . ” But all these are anonymous</p>
     <note>42</note>
     <p>in the edition of 1614 , and the editor appends to the last one the following remark :</p>
     <p>“ These three [ or four ? ] ditties were taken out of Maister John Dowland 's Book of Tableture for the Lute . The authors ’ names not there set down , and therefore left to their owners . ”</p>
     <p>But it happens that the four ditties are all credited to “ Ignoto ” in the Table of Contents , prepared by the other editor , so that in the edition of 1614 “ Ignoto ” has twenty pieces , besides the one assigned to Marlowe .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">With all this confusion what are we to believe in regard to “ Ignoto ” ?</l>
       <l n="2">Was he sometimes Raleigh , sometimes Barnfield , sometimes Dyer , sometimes</l>
       <l n="3">Greville ,</l>
     </lg>
     <p>and sometimes Shakspere , or some one else ? Or was he a single person who “ loved better to be a poet than to be counted so ” and who affected to hoodwink the above-named Greville by writing to him in 1596 : “ For poets I can commend none , being resolved to be ever a stranger to them ” ?</p>
     <p>And here let us note a bit of internal evidence that Bacon wrote the little poem in praise of the “ Faery Queen ” signed “ Ignoto . ” One couplet of it is as follows :</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ For when men know the goodness of the wine ,</l>

     <head>AS THE CONCEALED POET IGNOTO</head>
     <p>And now what shall we say in regard to Marlowe 's ostensible authorship of a popular song , which was attributed to Shakspere in 1599 ? Is it not presumable that “ Ignoto , ” who wrote the “ Nymph 's Reply , ” and followed it with “ Another of the same nature made since ” in imitation of the song subscribed “ Chr . Marlowe ” — is it not probable that “ Ignoto ” ascribed his own original song to Marlowe ?</p>
     <p>Marlowe was buried June 1 , 1593 . In the same year Shakspere 's name first appeared in print as an author . And now among the startling revelations hitherto hidden in the Folio of 1623 , but made known through Bacon 's cipher discovered by the Hon . Ignatius Donnelly , is this sentence :</p>
     <p>“ Ever since Marlowe was killed Shakspere has been my mask . ”</p>
     <p>Another Poem by Bacon in 1590 .</p>
     <p>The 33d anniversary of Elizabeth 's coronation was celebrated November 17 , 1590 . Sir Henry Lea , the Queen 's champion and master of the armory , who had conducted the exercises from the beginning , appeared for the last time , and , after the customary performances , resigned his office to the Earl of Cumberland , whereupon the celebrated vocalist , Mr. Hales , a servant of her Majesty , pronounced and sung the following verses , personating the aged man-at-arms :</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ My golden locks hath time to silver turned ,</l>
       <l n="2">( O Time too swift , and swiftness never ceasing ! )</l>
       <l n="3">My youth ‘ gainst age , and age at youth hath spurned ,</l>
       <l n="4">But spurned in vain ; youth waneth , by increasing .</l>
       <l n="5">Beauty and strength , and youth flowers fading been ,</l>
       <l n="6">Duty , faith , love , are roots and ever green .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">“ My helmet now shall make a hive for bees ,</l>
       <l n="8">And lovers ’ songs shall turn to holy psalms ;</l>
       <l n="9">A man-at-arms must now stand on his knees ,</l>
       <l n="10">And feed on prayers that are old age 's alms .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="11">And so from court to cottage I depart ;</l>
       <l n="12">My saint is sure of my unspotted heart .</l>
       <l n="13">“ And when I sadly sit in lonely cell ,</l>
       <l n="14">I 'll teach my swains this carol for a song :</l>
       <l n="15">‘ Blest be the hearts that wish my Sovereign well ,</l>
       <l n="16">Curst be the souls that think to do her wrong . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="17">Goddess ! vouchsafe this aged man his right ,</l>
       <l n="18">To be your beadsman now that Was your knight . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="19">Parallels are found in Bacon and Shakspere with almost every sentiment</l>
       <l n="20">and expression in these lines . ( See Mrs. Pott 's “ Promus , ” p . 528 . )</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>The verses were published anonymously in Dowland 's “ First Book of Songs , ” 1600 , and again in 1844 ; both times with the pronouns changed from the first to the third person — e. g ., “ His golden locks , ” etc . In the “ Works of George Peele , ” 1828 , they are credited to that poet , but the only evidence adduced of his authorship is the fact that he , as an eye-witness , wrote a poetic description of the celebration in 1590 . Mrs. Pott is doubtless right in claiming for Bacon the authorship , and is only mistaken in supposing that the person to whom the verses were intended to apply was Lord Burleigh , who about that time , on account of the loss of his wife , had temporarily withdrawn from court .</p>

      <head>A CHRONOGRAPHIC PARALLEL</head>
      <head>A. D. 1585 . Bacon at 24 , in a letter to the Queen 's principal secretary , Sir Francis Walsingham , urges his some time pending suit , which is to determine his “ course of practice ” — supposed to mean a shortening of the five years ’ probation required to become a pleader .</head>
       <l n="1">He writes an essay entitled “ Greatest Birth of Time , ” foreshadowing his</l>
       <l n="2">scientific works .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>His mother in her zeal for the Nonconformists urges their cause in person before Lord Treasurer Burleigh , and follows it by a letter to the same in which she says :</p>
     <p>“ I confess as one that hath found mercy , that I have profited more in the inward feeling knowledge of God his holy will , though but in small measure , by an ordinary preaching within these seven or eight years , than I did by hearing odd sermons at Paul 's well nigh twenty years together . ”</p>
     <p>Shakspere at 21 is still living at Stratford , the father of three children — two of them twins . His father is said to have been a butcher as well as a dealer in wool ; and gossiping John Aubrey says he was told by some of the neighbors that when the boy William “ kill 'd a calfe , he wold doe it in a high style , and make a speeche . ”</p>
     <p>Mr. Richard Grant White guesses that William may have gone to London this year or the next .</p>
     <note>48</note>
     <p>A. D. 1586 . Bacon at 25 writes a letter , May 6th , to Lord Treasurer Burleigh , his uncle , saying :</p>
     <p>“ I find in my simple observation that they which live as it were in umbra and not in public or frequent action , how moderately and modestly soever they behave themselves , yet laborant inmdia . I find also that such persons as are of nature bashful ( as myself is ,) whereby they want that plausible familiarity which others have , are often mistaken for proud . But once I know well , and I most humbly beseech your Lordship to believe that arrogancy and overweening is so far from my nature , as , if I think well of myself in anything , it is in this , that I am free from that vice . ”</p>
     <p>He is again elected to Parliament . The conspirators who attempted to liberate Mary of Scotland have been tried , condemned , and sentenced . The case is brought before the Parliament . Bacon is one of the speakers in “ the Great Cause , ” and one of the committees to whom it is referred .</p>
     <p>Shakspere at 22 is probably still at Stratford , though Mr. White presumes he has become connected with the London stage this year , or perhaps a little later .</p>
     <note>To be continued to the end of both lives , making a book of 300 pages or more , including this pamphlet as an appendix , with important additions . All the essential facts of Lord Bacon 's life will be presented , whereby his secret authorship will be more abundantly proved , and his moral character vindicated against the aspersions of 260 years .</note>
