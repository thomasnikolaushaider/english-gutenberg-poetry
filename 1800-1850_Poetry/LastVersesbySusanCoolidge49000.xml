    <docTitle><titlePart>SUSAN COOLIDGE SARAH CHAUNCEY WOOLSEY ( Susan Coolidge ) was born in Cleveland , Ohio , January 29 , 1835 . Her father , John M. Woolsey , a New Yorker , had come to Cleveland to attend to property owned by his father , and had there met Jane Andrews , a charming and graceful girl from Connecticut , whom he made his wife . Their home was on Euclid Avenue , and comprised about five acres in house-lot , garden , orchard , pasture , and woodland . Here came into the world a family of four girls and a boy ,— all vigorous and active and full of life . Sarah was the eldest and the predestined leader of the little tribe . They grew up as children of that day did under similar conditions . There was the regular old-fashioned schooling , not too exacting or strenuous , and much wholesome out-of-door life . There were horses and dogs and cattle and birds for the children to care for and play with , and much climbing and romping were permitted in a place where no near neighbors could be disturbed . To the other children life was a joyous holiday , diversified with small disappointments and dismays ; but to Sarah the sky and the earth held boundless anticipations and intentions , and the world was a place of enchantment . She was always individual from the moment she first opened her big brown eyes — passionately loving and passionately wilful , with heroic intentions and desires , and with remorse and disappointments in proportion . Part of the woodland where the axe had not yet done its work of cutting and clipping was given to the children for a playground . They called it “ Paradise ,” and for all of them it was a place of rapture and mystery . To the others it was full of hiding places ,— to little Sarah the hiding places were bowers . They looked for eggs and birds ’ nests , and had thrilling encounters with furry wild creatures , which fled at their approach ; but her intercourse was all with the fairies and elves and gnomes which peopled the place . After a time they felt the presence of the fairies too ; but it was under the influence of her enthusiastic imagination , which controlled their own more mundane perceptions . With her for a leader they often passed into a new world of romance and adventure and high undertakings . They lived in battlemented castles , attended by knights and squires , with danger on all sides met by lofty courage ; or they rode on elephants in India , always on dignified missions , attended by great pomp and ceremony ; or they lived with fairies , whose gifts might crop up under every toadstool . To be sure , the elephant on which they made their proud progress might at other times , stripped of his trappings , be serviceable as a nursery table , and the fairy gifts were apt to bear a prosaic resemblance to certain well-known and well-worn nursery properties ; but invested with the mystery and romance cast upon them by Sarah ’ s vivid imagination , the little band went , as she led them , into the land of dreams , and felt no incongruity . Her education went on much as she chose . The best teachers available were employed , and to each in turn she became a favorite and interesting pupil ; but though her quick intelligence enabled her to pass excellent examinations and gave her a foremost place in her classes , she really assimilated and retained only what she enjoyed . Mathematics she ignored entirely . All scientific problems fascinated her by their results ; but she would not open her mind to the processes by which the results were reached . For languages she had no predilections , though she used her own with singular grace and precision , drawing her words from an apparently limitless vocabulary . Through life this charming use of language , combined with her keen humor and sympathetic appreciation of all that makes life stirring and vital , made her a most fascinating companion . Her delight in literature was her real education . From her early youth she revelled in books , reading so rapidly that it seemed impossible that she could remember what she read ; but , in fact , remembering it all ! To have looked over a poem two or three times was enough to make it a permanent possession . She devoured history , biography , romances , and poetry , and with intuitive judgment and taste revelled in what was really beautiful and interesting , and discarded the second-rate and commonplace . She began writing at a very early age ,— fairy stories , verses , and romances ,— but she never published anything until she had reached full maturity . Meantime she grew to vigorous , active womanhood , full of interests and friendships and delightful experiences of one sort and another . She was much loved , and gave such a wealth of self-forgetting , idolizing , ardent affection in return that her friends were all lovers . She drew a circle of loving admirers about her wherever she went , and was always totally unconscious of the charm she worked by her very sweet voice and manner , brilliant fun , and warm sympathy . The Civil War broke out just as she passed from girlhood to young womanhood . It aroused in her a passion of enthusiasm and devotion , and she threw herself with all her heart and soul into work for the soldiers at home and afield . In the Soldiers ’ Hospital at New Haven she was an enthusiastic helper , in the wards , or storeroom , or linen closet , wherever her energy was most needed . And her leisure was filled with knitting or sewing or preparing special diet for the sick and wounded . She was a tireless worker then and ever , and nature had endowed her with great practical gifts . She was an excellent cook and an expert needlewoman , both in plain sewing and the most dainty embroidery , and all work was done with such rapidity and perfection that it was a despair for the race of plodders even to watch her swift achievements . From New Haven she went to the Convalescent Hospital established at Portsmouth Grove , and was one of a band of excellent workers there during the second year of the war . It was a very developing and vivid experience , and one which she counted among the greatest points of interest in her life . When the war was over , her old career of busy , never-slackening industry and purpose began again . It was full , as ever , of friendships which could not possibly claim more than she was willing to give . She naturally drew around her the cleverest men and women of her acquaintance , and her society was sought far and near . But she did not really begin her life as an author until a few years later , when in a grove at Bethlehem , N. H ., sitting on a fallen tree , she sketched the outline of “ The New Year ’ s Bargain .” She had sent a few fugitive articles to certain magazines before this , but only now did she take up writing as a real work . That dainty little book , with its fantastic and graceful imaginings , was so well received by the public that she went on in a different vein , through the series of the “ Katy Did ” books , where fact and fiction , experience and fancy , were so blended that it was hardly possible to say in answer to the eager questionings of some of her little readers where the one ended and the other began . Katy found a large audience , and her biographer went on from children ’ s books to verses or historical studies , such as “ Old Convent Days ,” or mere editor ’ s work , like the condensations of those famous old diaries of Mrs. Delany and Miss Burney . She was consulting reader for Roberts Company in the days when the hall-mark of that firm was a proof of excellence . She was very industrious , but her literary work never seemed the most absorbing part of her life . This was partly because of her intense and vivid interest in the rest of life ,— the journeys , the visits , and above all the friends ,— and largely because she was absolutely devoid of literary vanity or self-consciousness . She seldom talked of her work or referred in any way to her success . Her verses found a warm welcome in many hearts whose owners were all unknown to her , and sometimes she acknowledged , with a sort of tender surprise , that it was a great reward to have been able to help and encourage others . But anything like flattery or mere compliment was very distasteful to her , and she sometimes owned impatiently that “ Susan Coolidge ” bored her to death , and she wished she had never heard of her ! While literature became the chief occupation of her life , her artistic temperament and love of the beautiful found expression in many other ways . She instinctively surrounded herself with beautiful objects and colors . Her taste was almost unerring , and harmony of design and softly shaded tints seemed to be her natural setting . She transformed every room she lived in , were it for a week only . She thought little of her drawings in water color . They were all flower pieces studied from life , and she was conscious of the little instruction she had received and her ignorance of technique . But all the same these lovely panels were a joy to those who were fortunate enough to possess them . As was once said by one who was no mean artist himself , “ She can do what many artists — adepts in technique — fail in . She gives us the flower in all its life and spirit .” Her china painting — necessarily more conventional — was still charming , holding something of her individuality . This vivid life of purpose and energy and never-failing zest appeared to bubble up from such an inexhaustible fountain of vitality that it seemed as if it might go on for ever . But gradually a shadow stole over it — not a very dark one at first , but inexorable . She fought with it , played with it , defied it , but it was always there ! She could not acknowledge defeat and was always planning for the future with gay self-confidence ; but the shadow grew ! By and by the narrowing limits shut her in her chamber , but even then she looked out upon the days to come with undaunted courage . The chamber was not like a sick room . It was bright with sunshine and the sparkle of fire , and scented and gay with the flowers she so dearly loved . Here she read and wrote and saw her many friends . From hence came words of rejoicing for all her dear ones who were happy , and words of truest sympathy for those who were sad . She was one of the few people to whom the joys and sorrows of others are of equal importance to their own . She pondered over the lives of her friends with never-ending interest , and gave at every turn and crisis the truest and most comprehending sympathy . No wonder that so many warmed hands and hearts by that generous flame !</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>Slowly the shadow deepened . She was disturbed by it , but still wrote happily of the future and filled it with plans and purposes . But one day , April 9 ,<date>1905</date>, very gently , Death ’ s finger touched her . She was not conscious of pain or trouble , “ only a new sensation ,” but she closed her eyes , and without a word of farewell , was gone away from us . It is hard to sum up such a life . It was a very full and happy one . She gave much , but received much . She loved beauty , and she was always surrounded by it . She loved friendship , and nobody had more or better friends . She gave them of her best , but she drew their best from them . Hers was an ideal companionship , so full of appreciative interest and sympathy , so illuminated by wit and humor . She was ardent and eager in her plans of life . Nothing could exceed the absorption and energy with which she carried them out . But she accepted disappointment , after a little struggle , with a gay insouciance . So when the final defeat came she seemed to resign herself without struggle to the inevitable , and to those of us who loved her best it seemed as if that sweet and brilliant and unwearied spirit had only folded its wings for a moment before taking a longer and surer flight .</docImprint>

       <l n="51">The pitiful , grieved angels overhead</l>

      <head>THE PRICE OF FREYA</head>
      <note>Freya , in the Scandinavian mythology , was the goddess of Youth and Hope . While she remained with the gods and fed them daily with her golden apples they were all-powerful ; but when Wodin parted with her as the price for the building of Walhalla , they suddenly became weak and weary , and a shadow rested over the world . Walhalla was of no worth without Freya .</note>

      <head>A SPRING PARABLE</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">TILL yesterday one tree was brown ,—</l>
       <l n="2">One only , mid the green of spring ;</l>
       <l n="3">Wearing her dead leaves like a crown</l>
       <l n="4">She stood , and seemed to gloom and frown</l>

       <l n="6">Till yesterday ! When , touched at last ,</l>

       <l n="8">And the poor tree forgave her past ,</l>
       <l n="9">And learned to hope , and thick and fast</l>
       <l n="10">Showered her dry leaves on the world .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="11">Swift sudden hope replaced despair ;</l>

       <l n="16">Souls have their dead leaves , sere and dry ,</l>

       <l n="19">Worthless to every human eye ;</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="21">And feel that life were bare indeed</l>
       <l n="22">If we should lose them , or let fall ,</l>
       <l n="23">And all the old-time hurts would bleed ,</l>
       <l n="24">And we unwrapped from sorrowing weed</l>
       <l n="25">Like mourners dragged to carnival .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="26">Then in a moment suddenly</l>
       <l n="27">God ’ s blessed sunshine , all unguessed ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">THE day was hot , the way was long , the feet were tired , so tired ;</l>
       <l n="2">The goal is won toward which we strove , the goal so long desired ,</l>
       <l n="3">The eyes which sought the distant hope through wavering mists of care ,</l>
       <l n="4">See it at last , oh close , so close in Paradise the Fair .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">The black , black night through which we groped is turned to radiant day ,</l>
       <l n="6">The doubt to certainty more glad than song or speech can say ;</l>
       <l n="7">The baffling winds which buffeted beyond our strength to bear ,</l>
       <l n="8">Blew us along the blessed way to Paradise the Fair .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">We doubted and we fainted , and we seemed to miss the road</l>
       <l n="10">As , stumbling on and painfully , we toiled beneath our load ;</l>
       <l n="11">And the uphill left us breathless , and the tempest stripped us bare ;—</l>
       <l n="12">What matter , since they bore us up to Paradise the Fair ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">We who were lonely once and found the silence very sore ,</l>
       <l n="14">Companioned round by our beloved are lonely never more ;</l>
       <l n="15">The puzzles all are now explained , and the griefs which grieved us there</l>
       <l n="16">Are proved to be the Lord ’ s sure path to Paradise the Fair .</l>

       <l n="12">Billow to billow still beckoning and calling ,</l>
       <l n="13">Heaving , receding , now farther , now nigher ,</l>

       <l n="16">Gaily and strongly it comes from the distance ;</l>
       <l n="17">Till , at the end of the plunge and the roar ,</l>
       <l n="18">It is full tide , and the sea rules the shore .</l>

       <l n="22">Now it rejoiceth , and now it bewaileth ;</l>
       <l n="23">Now its hopes fructify , then they are blighted ;</l>
       <l n="24">Now it walks sunnily , now gropes benighted ;</l>
       <l n="25">Fed by discouragements , taught by disaster ,</l>
       <l n="26">So it goes forward , now slower , now faster ,</l>
       <l n="27">Till , all the pain past , and failures made whole ,</l>
