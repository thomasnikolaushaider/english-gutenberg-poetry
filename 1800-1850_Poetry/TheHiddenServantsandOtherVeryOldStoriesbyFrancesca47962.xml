     <p>* Introduction * To those who are fortunate enough to know Miss Alexander 's pen and pencil pictures of Italian peasant life the very name of Francesca , over which her early work was published , carries with it an aroma as of those humbler graces of her adopted people ,— their sunny charity , their native sense of the beautiful , their childlike faith ,— which touch the heart more intimately than all their great achievements in History and in Art . For those , however , to whom are yet unknown her faithful transcripts in picture and story from the lives of the people she loves , a word of introduction has been asked ; and it was perhaps thought that the task might properly be entrusted to one who had heard The Hidden Servants and many another of these poems from the lips of Francesca herself . Yet , rightly considered , could any experience have better served to banish from the mind such irrelevant intruders as facts ,— those literal facts and data at least which the uninitiated might be so mistaken as to desire , but which none who knew Francesca 's work could regard as of the slightest consequence ? Imagine a quiet , green-latticed room in Venice overlooking the Grand Canal whose waters keep time in gently audible lappings to the lilt of the verse ,— that lilt that is apparent even in the printed line , but which only a voice trained to Italian cadences can perfectly give . Imagine that voice half chanting , half reciting , these old , old legends , and with an absolute sincerity of conviction which stirs the mind of the listeners , mere children of to-day though they be , to a faith akin to that which conceived the tales . Where is there place for facts in such a scene , in such an experience ? Or , if facts must be , are not all that are requisite easily to be gleaned from the poems themselves ? Why state that Francesca is the daughter of an American artist , or that she has spent her life in Italy , when the artist inheritance , the Italian atmosphere , breathes in every poem our little book contains ? Why make mention even of Ruskin 's enthusiastic heralding of her work , when the very spirit of it is so essentially that which the great idealist was seeking all his life that he could scarcely have failed to discover and applaud it had it been ever so retiring , ever so hidden ? Nor does it matter that the Alexander home chances to be in Florence rather than in Venice , since it is Italy itself that lives in Francesca 's work ; nor that she is Protestant rather than Catholic , when it is religion pure and simple , unrestricted by any creed , that makes vital each line she writes or draws . Yet of the poems , if not of the writer , there remained still something to learn , and accordingly a letter of inquiry was sent her ; and her own reply , written with no thought of publication , is a better report than another could give . This is what she says :— “ With regard to this present collection of ballads , I can tell its history in a few words . When I was a young girl many old and curious books fell into my hands and became my favourite reading ( next to the Bible , and , perhaps , the Divina Commedia ) , as I found in them the strong faith and simple modes of thought which were what I liked and wanted . Afterwards , in my constant intercourse with the country people , and especially with old people whom I always loved , I heard a great many legends and traditions , often beautiful , often instructive , and which , as far as I knew , had never been written down . I was always in request with children for the stories which I knew and could tell , and , as I found they liked these legends , I thought it a pity they should be lost after I should have passed away , and so I always meant to write them down ; all the more that I had felt the need of such reading when I was a child myself . But I never had time to write them as long as my eyes permitted me to work at my drawing , and afterwards , when I wanted to begin them , I found myself unable to write at all for more than a few minutes at once . Finally I thought of turning the stories into rhyme and learning them all by heart , so that I could write them down little by little . I thought children would not be very particular , if I could just make the dear old stories vivid and comprehensible , which I tried to do . If , as you kindly hope , they may be good for older people as well , then it must be that when the Lord took from me one faculty He gave me another ; which is in no way impossible . And I think of the beautiful Italian proverb : ‘ When God shuts a door He opens a window . ’ ”</p>

    <docImprint>After such an account of the origin and growth of these poems no further comment would seem fitting , unless it be that made by Cardinal Manning when writing to Mr. Ruskin in<date>1883</date>to thank him for a copy of Francesca 's Story of Ida . He writes :— “ It is simply beautiful , like the Fioretti di San Francesco . Such flowers can grow in one soil alone . They can be found only in the Garden of Faith , over which the world of light hangs visibly , and is more intensely seen by the poor and the pure in heart than by the rich , or the learned , or the men of culture . ” ANNA FULLER .</docImprint>

    <head>* THE OLD STORY-TELLER *</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In my upper chamber here ,</l>
     <l n="2">Still I wait from year to year ;</l>
     <l n="3">Wondering when the time will come</l>
     <l n="4">That the Lord will call me home .</l>
     <l n="5">All the rest have been removed ,—</l>
     <l n="6">Those I worked for , those I loved ;</l>
     <l n="7">And , at times , there seems to be</l>
     <l n="8">Little use on earth for me .</l>
     <l n="9">Still God keeps me — He knows why —</l>
     <l n="10">When so many younger die !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">From my window I look down</l>
     <l n="12">On the busy , bustling town .</l>
     <l n="13">But beyond its noise and jar</l>
     <l n="14">I can see the hills afar ;</l>
     <l n="15">And above it , the blue sky ,</l>
     <l n="16">And the white clouds sailing by ;</l>
     <l n="17">And the sunbeams , as they shine</l>
     <l n="18">On a world that is not mine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">Here I wait , while life shall last ,</l>
     <l n="20">An old relic of the past ,</l>
     <l n="21">Feeling strange , and far away</l>
     <l n="22">From the people of to-day ;</l>
     <l n="23">Thankful for the memory dear</l>
     <l n="24">Of a morning , always near ,</l>
     <l n="25">Though long vanished , and so fair !</l>
     <l n="26">Dewy flowers and April air ;</l>
     <l n="27">Thankful that the storms of noon</l>
     <l n="28">Spent their force and died so soon ;</l>
     <l n="29">Thankful , as their echoes cease ,</l>
     <l n="30">For this twilight hour of peace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="31">But my life , to evening grown ,</l>
     <l n="32">Still has pleasures of its own .</l>
     <l n="33">Up my stairway , long and steep ,</l>
     <l n="34">Now and then the children creep ;</l>
     <l n="35">Gather round me , where I sit</l>
     <l n="36">All day long , and dream , and knit ;</l>
     <l n="37">Fill my room with happy noise —</l>
     <l n="38">May God bless them , girls and boys !</l>
     <l n="39">Then sweet eyes upon me shine ,</l>
     <l n="40">Dimpled hands are laid in mine ;</l>
     <l n="41">And I never ask them why</l>
     <l n="42">They have sought to climb so high ;</l>
     <l n="43">For ‘ twere useless to enquire !</l>
     <l n="44">‘ Tis a story they desire ,</l>
     <l n="45">Taken from my ancient store ,</l>
     <l n="46">None the worse if heard before ;</l>
     <l n="47">And they turn , with pleading looks ,</l>
     <l n="48">To my shelf of time-worn books ,</l>
     <l n="49">Bound in parchment brown with age .</l>
     <l n="50">Little in them to engage</l>
     <l n="51">Children 's fancy , one would say !</l>
     <l n="52">Yet , when tired with noisy play ,</l>
     <l n="53">Nothing pleases them so well</l>
     <l n="54">As the stories I can tell</l>
     <l n="55">From those pages , old and gray ,</l>
     <l n="56">With their edges worn away ;</l>
     <l n="57">Spelling queer , and Woodcut quaint .</l>
     <l n="58">Angel , demon , prince , and saint ,</l>
     <l n="59">Much alike in face and air ;</l>
     <l n="60">Houses tipping here and there ,</l>
     <l n="61">Lion , palm-tree , hermit 's cell ,</l>
     <l n="62">And much more I need not tell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="63">Then they all attentive wait ,</l>
     <l n="64">While the story I relate ,</l>
     <l n="65">And , before the half is told ,</l>
     <l n="66">I forget that I am old !</l>
     <l n="67">But one age there seems to be</l>
     <l n="68">For the little ones and me .</l>
     <l n="69">What though all be new and strange ,</l>
     <l n="70">Little children never change ;</l>
     <l n="71">All is shifting day by day ,—</l>
     <l n="72">Worse or better , who can say ?</l>
     <l n="73">Much we lose , and much we learn ,</l>
     <l n="74">But the children still return ,</l>
     <l n="75">As the flowers do , every year ;</l>
     <l n="76">Just as innocent and dear</l>
     <l n="77">As those babes who first did meet</l>
     <l n="78">At our Heavenly Master 's feet .</l>
     <l n="79">In His arms He took them all :</l>
     <l n="80">Oh , ‘ tis precious to recall —</l>
     <l n="81">Blessed to believe it true —</l>
     <l n="82">That what we love He loved too !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="83">Since the time when life was new ,</l>
     <l n="84">All my long , long journey through ,</l>
     <l n="85">I have story-teller been .</l>
     <l n="86">When a child I did begin</l>
     <l n="87">To my playmates ; later on ,</l>
     <l n="88">Other children , long since gone ,</l>
     <l n="89">Came to listen ; and of some ,</l>
     <l n="90">Still the children 's children come !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="91">Some , the dearest , took their flight ,</l>
     <l n="92">In the early morning light ,</l>
     <l n="93">To the glory far away ,</l>
     <l n="94">Made for them and such as they .</l>
     <l n="95">I have lingered till the last ;</l>
     <l n="96">All the busy hours are past ;</l>
     <l n="97">Now my sun is in the west ,</l>
     <l n="98">Slowly sinking down to rest</l>
     <l n="99">Ere it wholly fades from view ,</l>
     <l n="100">One thing only I would do :</l>
     <l n="101">From my stories I would choose</l>
     <l n="102">Those ‘ t would grieve me most to lose .</l>
     <l n="103">And would tell them once again</l>
     <l n="104">For the children who remain ,</l>
     <l n="105">And for others , yet to be ,</l>
     <l n="106">Whom on earth I may not see .</l>
     <l n="107">Here , within this volume small ,</l>
     <l n="108">I have thought to write them all ;</l>
     <l n="109">And to-day the work commence ,</l>
     <l n="110">Trusting , ere God call me hence ,</l>
     <l n="111">I may see the whole complete .</l>
     <l n="112">It will be a labour sweet ,</l>
     <l n="113">Calling back , in sunset glow ,</l>
     <l n="114">Happy hours of long ago .</l>

    <p>* THE HIDDEN SERVANTS *</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="17">A sheltered nook on a mountain side ,</l>
     <l n="18">Shut in , and guarded , and fortified</l>
     <l n="19">By rocks that hardly a goat would climb ,</l>
     <l n="20">All smoothed by tempest and bleached by time —</l>
     <l n="21">Such was the spot that the hermit chose ,</l>
     <l n="22">From youth to age , for his life 's repose .</l>
     <l n="23">There had he lived for forty years ,</l>
     <l n="24">Trying , with penance and prayers and tears ,</l>
     <l n="25">To make his soul like a polished stone</l>
     <l n="26">In God 's great temple ; for this alone</l>
     <l n="27">Was the one dear wish that his soul possessed ,</l>
     <l n="28">And ‘ t was little he cared for all the rest ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="29">Nothing had changed since first he came ;</l>
     <l n="30">The sky and the mountain were all the same ,</l>
     <l n="31">Only a beech-tree , that there had grown</l>
     <l n="32">Ere ever he builded his cell of stone ,</l>
     <l n="33">Had risen and spread to a stately grace ,</l>
     <l n="34">And its shifting shadow filled half the place .</l>
     <l n="35">Many a winter its storms had spent ,</l>
     <l n="36">Many a summer its sunshine lent</l>
     <l n="37">To the little cell , till it came to look</l>
     <l n="38">Like another rock in the peaceful nook .</l>
     <l n="39">Mosses and lichen had veiled the wall ,</l>
     <l n="40">Till it hardly seemed like a dwelling at all .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="41">‘ T was a peaceful home when the days were soft ,</l>
     <l n="42">And spring in her sweetness crept aloft</l>
     <l n="43">From the plains below where her work was done ,</l>
     <l n="44">And the hills grew green in the warming sun .</l>
     <l n="45">And in summer the cell of the hermit seemed</l>
     <l n="46">Like part of that heaven of which he dreamed :</l>
     <l n="47">For the turf behind those walls of flint</l>
     <l n="48">Was sprinkled with flowers of rainbow tint ;</l>
     <l n="49">And never a sound but the bees ’ low hum ,</l>
     <l n="50">As over the blossoms they go and come ;</l>
     <l n="51">Or — when one listened — the fainter tones</l>
     <l n="52">Of a spring that bubbled between the stones .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="53">But dreary it was on a winter 's night ,</l>
     <l n="54">When the snow fell heavy and soft and white .</l>
     <l n="55">And at times , when the morn was cold and keen ,</l>
     <l n="56">The footprints of wolves at his door were seen .</l>
     <l n="57">But cold or hunger he hardly felt ,</l>
     <l n="58">So near to heaven the good man dwelt ;</l>
     <l n="59">And as for danger — why , death , to him ,</l>
     <l n="60">Meant only joining the Seraphim !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="61">Poorly he lived , and hardly fared ;</l>
     <l n="62">And when the acorns and roots he shared</l>
     <l n="63">With mole or squirrel , he asked no more ,</l>
     <l n="64">But thanked the Lord for such welcome store .</l>
     <l n="65">The richest feast he could ever know</l>
     <l n="66">Was when the shepherds who dwelt below ,</l>
     <l n="67">Whose sheep in the mountain pastures fed ,</l>
     <l n="68">Would bring him cheeses , or barley bread ,</l>
     <l n="69">Or — after harvest — a bag of meal ;</l>
     <l n="70">And then they would all before him kneel ,</l>
     <l n="71">On flowery turf or on moss-grown rocks ,</l>
     <l n="72">To ask a blessing for them and their flocks ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="73">And once or twice he had wandered out</l>
     <l n="74">To preach in the country round about ,</l>
     <l n="75">Where unto many his words were blest ;</l>
     <l n="76">Then back he climbed to his quiet nest .</l>
     <l n="77">By all in trouble his aid was sought ;</l>
     <l n="78">And women their pining children brought ,</l>
     <l n="79">For a touch of his hand to ease their pain ,</l>
     <l n="80">And his prayers to make them strong again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="81">And now one wish in his heart remained :</l>
     <l n="82">He longed to know what his soul had gained ,</l>
     <l n="83">And how he had grown in the Master 's grace ,</l>
     <l n="84">Since first he came to that lonely place .</l>
     <l n="85">This wish was haunting him night and day ,</l>
     <l n="86">He never could drive the thought away .</l>
     <l n="87">Until at length in the beech-tree 's shade</l>
     <l n="88">He knelt , and with all his soul he prayed</l>
     <l n="89">That God would grant him to know and see</l>
     <l n="90">A man , if such in the world might be ,</l>
     <l n="91">Whose soul in the heavenly grace had grown</l>
     <l n="92">To the self-same measure as his own ;</l>
     <l n="93">Whose treasure on the celestial shore</l>
     <l n="94">Could neither be less than his nor more .</l>

     <l n="105">* The Origin of the Indian Corn *</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>This story was told me by the Contessa Vittoria Percoto Antonini of Palmanuova , who said that she heard it in her youth at a Fila , which is a sort of social gathering held in the winter evenings by the contadini in that part of the country .</p>
   <p>The winter is cold , and these contadini , who are very poor and can ill afford the wood for a fire , meet in the cattle-shed , where the breath of cows and oxen warms the air a little .</p>
   <p>They often say , “ It is the way that the Gesu Bambino was warmed ! ” A lantern hangs from one of the beams overhead , and by its dim light the women spin or knit . All talk together , and ( as the Contessa Vittoria expresses it ) “ the boys make themselves agreeable to the girls , very much as though it were a party of ladies and gentlemen . ”</p>
   <p>And from time to time the elder people entertain the company with stories , of which this is a pretty fair specimen .</p>

    <head>* THE MANSION IN HEAVEN *</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In pomp and state , with following great , the Bishop Troilus came</l>
     <l n="2">To the town of Alexandria , which knew him long by fame ,</l>
     <l n="3">To see the holy Patriarch , who had been his friend of old ,</l>
     <l n="4">To hear his words of wisdom , and his saintly life behold .</l>
     <l n="5">In youth their paths together lay , and both with one accord</l>
     <l n="6">Had chosen then the better part , and thought to serve the Lord ;</l>
     <l n="7">For half a century now and more had each one gone his way .</l>
     <l n="8">The Patriarch nearer was to God , far nearer than that day ;</l>
     <l n="9">For his soul was like a garden where the flowers that then were</l>
     <l n="10">sown ,</l>
     <l n="11">With care and patient tending , had to perfect beauty grown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="12">And Troilus ? ... In the world 's esteem he stood as high , or</l>
     <l n="13">higher ;</l>
     <l n="14">His piety did all men praise , his eloquence admire ;</l>
     <l n="15">He had fiery words to thrill them , he had flowery words to</l>
     <l n="16">please ,</l>
     <l n="17">And when he preached on festal days , the people swarmed like</l>
     <l n="18">bees ;</l>
     <l n="19">From altar steps to open door there was hardly room to stand .</l>
     <l n="20">And ‘ t was not the sermon only , but his presence was so grand ;</l>
     <l n="21">With his grave and aged beauty , with his form erect and tall ,</l>
     <l n="22">With saintly face and silver hair , he won the hearts of all .</l>
     <l n="23">When through the city he returned , so lofty and serene ,</l>
     <l n="24">A train of priests attended him , all with obsequious mien ;</l>
     <l n="25">And children followed open-eyed , and gentle ladies bent</l>
     <l n="26">From balcony and window high to see him as he went .</l>
     <l n="27">Indeed he was a stately sight in silken raiment clad ,</l>
     <l n="28">The ring he wore was valued more than aught the Patriarch had ;</l>
     <l n="29">And the cross upon his bosom , that the people wondering viewed ,</l>
     <l n="30">Gave back the sunshine , when he walked , from jewels many-hued .</l>
     <l n="31">And men said his life was blameless , but it still must be</l>
     <l n="32">confessed ,</l>
     <l n="33">Though the saints were glad to own him , yet the sinners loved</l>
     <l n="34">him best .</l>
     <l n="35">He was rich , and he was famous , and , as all his life had shown ,</l>
     <l n="36">He was great in worldly wisdom , and the world will love its own .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="37">But while saints and shiners praised him , there was one who did</l>
     <l n="38">not praise ,</l>
     <l n="39">But whose eyes forever watched him with a sad and anxious gaze ;</l>
     <l n="40">For the Patriarch , simple-hearted , was not dazzled like the</l>
     <l n="41">rest ,</l>
     <l n="42">And he knew the deadly passion that the Bishop 's soul</l>
     <l n="43">possessed ,—</l>
     <l n="44">Yes , more deadly than another , for it lay so still and cold ,</l>
     <l n="45">Like a serpent coiled within him ,— ‘ twas the growing love of</l>
     <l n="46">gold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="47">It had choked away his pleasure , it had eaten up his peace ,</l>
     <l n="48">As with every year that left him he had seen his wealth</l>
     <l n="49">increase ,</l>
     <l n="50">Till his heart grew dry and withered in the smoke of worldly</l>
     <l n="51">care ;</l>
     <l n="52">But it dulled him with its poison , and he knew not it was there .</l>
     <l n="53">Oh , the Patriarch longed to see him from such cruel bondage</l>
     <l n="54">free ,</l>
     <l n="55">And he pleaded hard for Troilus every night on bended knee ;</l>
     <l n="56">For there yet was time to save him , so he hoped and so believed ,</l>
     <l n="57">But the days and weeks were passing , and no answer he received .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="58">But with praying he grew bolder , and to combat he began ,</l>
     <l n="59">And he left his door one morning with a wise and hopeful plan ;</l>
     <l n="60">And he said in solemn murmur , as he walked along the way ,</l>
     <l n="61">“ I must go and fight with Satan for my brother 's soul to-day ;</l>
     <l n="62">He is cruel , he is cunning , but his arts will be in vain ,</l>
     <l n="63">The strongest net he ever wove will never bear the strain</l>
     <l n="64">Of seeing and of hearing what each day I hear and see ,</l>
     <l n="65">And the Lord has saved my brother if he will but come with me . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="66">It was in the early morning , long before the noise and heat ,</l>
     <l n="67">And the life was just beginning in the shady city street ,</l>
     <l n="68">When he saw a church door open , and he turned and entered in .</l>
     <l n="69">“ I will ask the Lord to help me in this work that I begin . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="70">There were some who entered near him , and he saw they came in</l>
     <l n="71">haste ,</l>
     <l n="72">Toiling men and burdened women , who had little time to waste ;</l>
     <l n="73">But they stole some precious minutes in that church to kneel and</l>
     <l n="74">pray ,</l>
     <l n="75">To refresh their souls and cheer them for the labours of the</l>
     <l n="76">day ;</l>
     <l n="77">And they gathered close around him on the pavement , for they</l>
     <l n="78">felt</l>
     <l n="79">That their prayers would rise the higher if their father with</l>
     <l n="80">them knelt .</l>
     <l n="81">Then he said to them : “ My children , you must help me now indeed ,</l>
     <l n="82">For my heart and soul are troubled for a friend in sorest need ;</l>
     <l n="83">He is low with mortal sickness , but no earthly skill can cure .</l>
     <l n="84">Pray the Lord to show His mercy to the poorest of the poor . ”</l>
     <l n="85">So they knelt and prayed together , till the morning sun was</l>
     <l n="86">high ,</l>
     <l n="87">For the Patriarch 's heart was kindled , and the time went quickly</l>
     <l n="88">by .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="89">Troilus too had risen early , and had said his morning prayers ,</l>
     <l n="90">But he said them somewhat coldly , being filled with other cares .</l>
     <l n="91">At that moment he was thinking , while he counted up his store ,</l>
     <l n="92">Upon certain silver goblets he had seen the day before ,</l>
     <l n="93">Which a silversmith had brought him , and had hoped that he would</l>
     <l n="94">buy .</l>
     <l n="95">They were nobly wrought and chiselled , and the price indeed was</l>
     <l n="96">high ,</l>
     <l n="97">But he thought upon his table they would look exceeding fine</l>
     <l n="98">When his friends , the rich and noble , should come in with him to</l>
     <l n="99">dine ;</l>
     <l n="100">Then how all of them would envy , and the thought his spirit</l>
     <l n="101">cheered ,—</l>
     <l n="102">When a gentle knock aroused him , and the Patriarch appeared .</l>
     <l n="103">Very bright his eyes were shining , and his face was all aglow ,</l>
     <l n="104">But his voice was strange and solemn , when he told him , “ I must</l>
     <l n="105">go</l>
     <l n="106">To the hospital , my brother , and I came here on my way ;</l>
     <l n="107">If we both could go together , it would be a happy day .</l>
     <l n="108">There I find my greatest blessing , every morning fresh and new ,</l>
     <l n="109">But far greater , but far sweeter could I share it once with</l>
     <l n="110">you . ”</l>
     <l n="111">How the heart of Troilus softened , as those eyes upon him shone ,</l>
     <l n="112">At their look of earnest pleading , at the tremor in the tone !</l>
     <l n="113">Strange it was that look could melt him and that voice could</l>
     <l n="114">change him so ,</l>
     <l n="115">Calling back to life , a moment , what had withered long ago ,—</l>
     <l n="116">Some old good that stirred within him , often spurned and thrust</l>
     <l n="117">aside .</l>
     <l n="118">But the flowers the Lord had planted , though they dwindled , had</l>
     <l n="119">not died ;</l>
     <l n="120">He was poor in heavenly treasure , but he loved the Patriarch</l>
     <l n="121">still .</l>
     <l n="122">“ I will come , ” he answered quickly ; “ you may lead me where you</l>
     <l n="123">will . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="124">There were looks and tones of wonder in the hospital that day ,</l>
     <l n="125">From the rows of low white couches where the sick and dying lay ,</l>
     <l n="126">As , with all his train about him , in his splendour and his</l>
     <l n="127">pride ,</l>
     <l n="128">On he walked , the Bishop Troilus , by the simple Patriarch 's</l>
     <l n="129">side .</l>
     <l n="130">But erelong the two were parted , for as Troilus looked around ,</l>
     <l n="131">He recoiled in shrinking horror from each doleful sight and</l>
     <l n="132">sound ;</l>
     <l n="133">While the Patriarch loved to linger for a while by every bed ,</l>
     <l n="134">With his strong arms ever ready to sustain a drooping head ;</l>
     <l n="135">Happy in each humble service , and forgetting all his state ,</l>
     <l n="136">While he thanked the Lord who sent him on these stricken ones to</l>
     <l n="137">wait .</l>
     <l n="138">How the pale sad faces brightened into smiles as he drew near ,</l>
     <l n="139">And what loving words were murmured , faintly murmured in his</l>
     <l n="140">ear !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="141">“ Does he well , ” said Bishop Troilus , as he saw him turn and go</l>
     <l n="142">From one bedside to another , “ does he well to stoop so low ? ”</l>
     <l n="143">Yet had Troilus only known it , they were not the poor alone</l>
     <l n="144">Whom his brother served that morning , but their Master and his</l>
     <l n="145">own .</l>
     <l n="146">There was one but just recovered , light of heart , though poor</l>
     <l n="147">and weak ,</l>
     <l n="148">With a journey long before him , going forth his home to seek ,</l>
     <l n="149">Far away among the mountains where his wife and children stayed ;</l>
     <l n="150">But the Patriarch 's love had found him ere the stranger sought</l>
     <l n="151">his aid ,</l>
     <l n="152">Giving money for the journey , giving blessed words of cheer .</l>
     <l n="153">Then he turned , for time was pressing , and a sadder face lay</l>
     <l n="154">near ,</l>
     <l n="155">Worn by months of pain and languor ; he was young , had once been</l>
     <l n="156">strong ,</l>
     <l n="157">He was fading now , but slowly , and perhaps would suffer long ,</l>
     <l n="158">And the hundred wants of sickness who can know that has not</l>
     <l n="159">proved ?</l>
     <l n="160">He had wearied all about him , but the Patriarch 's heart was</l>
     <l n="161">moved ;</l>
     <l n="162">So he heard the long complaining to which no one else gave heed ,</l>
     <l n="163">Then he left him , soothed and peaceful , with enough for all his</l>
     <l n="164">need .</l>
     <l n="165">So with one and with another for a moment he would stay ,</l>
     <l n="166">At each bed he left a blessing , and a blessing brought away ,</l>
     <l n="167">Till his purse grew light and empty , as had happened oft before ;</l>
     <l n="168">Though he turned it up and shook it , there was not one penny</l>
     <l n="169">more .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="170">Then he turned and sought for Troilus , who that moment , as it</l>
     <l n="171">chanced ,</l>
     <l n="172">With a look subdued and solemn , stood and gazed , like one</l>
     <l n="173">entranced ,</l>
     <l n="174">On the strange , unearthly beauty , on the light of perfect peace</l>
     <l n="175">In a woman 's face before him ; she was nearing her release ,</l>
     <l n="176">And a glory rested on her from the opening door above ;</l>
     <l n="177">Yet one shadow marred its splendour when she looked with anxious</l>
     <l n="178">love</l>
     <l n="179">On a little maid , her daughter , with a pretty , careworn face ,</l>
     <l n="180">Who had brought two younger children , waiting now for her</l>
     <l n="181">embrace ,</l>
     <l n="182">Wondering why she did not give it , why so deadly still she lay ,</l>
     <l n="183">For they knew not , though she knew it , she would not live out</l>
     <l n="184">the day .</l>
     <l n="185">Said the Patriarch : “ Brother Troilus , have you nothing you could</l>
     <l n="186">give</l>
     <l n="187">To this woman and her children , for she has not long to live ?</l>
     <l n="188">And I see her mind is troubled , and I think , before they part ,</l>
     <l n="189">Had she something she could leave them , it would ease her</l>
     <l n="190">burdened heart ;</l>
     <l n="191">For myself , I freely promise I will make these babes my care ,</l>
     <l n="192">But to-day my purse is empty , so I pray you not to spare . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="193">Oh ! alas , poor Bishop Troilus ! how this pleading broke the spell</l>
     <l n="194">That the woman 's look had woven , and how low his spirit fell !</l>
     <l n="195">For he dearly loved his money , with a passion deep and blind ,</l>
     <l n="196">As a scholar loves his learning , or a saint his peace of mind .</l>
     <l n="197">But the eyes of all were on him at that moment , and he knew</l>
     <l n="198">‘ T was in hopeful expectation of what such a saint would do ;</l>
     <l n="199">There were many who had entered from the busy street to gaze ,</l>
     <l n="200">He would not be shamed before them , they should still have cause</l>
     <l n="201">to praise ;</l>
     <l n="202">But his purse would have to open , so he turned and waved his</l>
     <l n="203">hand</l>
     <l n="204">To the priest who always bore it , with a gesture of command .</l>
     <l n="205">“ For this woman for her daughter and the two poor babes , ” said</l>
     <l n="206">he ,</l>
     <l n="207">“ Lay down thirty golden pieces in the Patriarch 's hand for me . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="208">There were none who had not heard him , for his voice was loud</l>
     <l n="209">and clear ,</l>
     <l n="210">And a low , admiring murmur rose from all the couches near ,</l>
     <l n="211">While the Patriarch stood rejoicing in the deed his friend had</l>
     <l n="212">done ;</l>
     <l n="213">By himself he judged another , and he thought the victory won .</l>
     <l n="214">For one moment Bishop Troilus feels his narrow heart expand ,</l>
     <l n="215">When the maiden thanks him weeping , and the children kiss his</l>
     <l n="216">hand ,</l>
     <l n="217">And the mother , just departing , from the pillow where she lies ,</l>
     <l n="218">Turns one happy smile upon him , with a blessing in her eyes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="219">But alas ! on home returning , when the sacrifice was made ,</l>
     <l n="220">When the Patriarch 's holy presence was no longer there to aid ,</l>
     <l n="221">He did much bewail his money ; half in anger , half in pain ,</l>
     <l n="222">To have parted in a moment with what took so long to gain .</l>
     <l n="223">And his heart was in a turmoil , and a pain was in his head ,</l>
     <l n="224">Till the raging turned to fever , and he threw him on his bed</l>
     <l n="225">In a storm of angry passion that no reason could control ;</l>
     <l n="226">For to him to part with money was like parting with his soul .</l>
     <l n="227">But he said no word to any of this rage and inward strife ,</l>
     <l n="228">And the priests who waited on him were in terror for his life ,</l>
     <l n="229">And as nothing made him better , they took counsel , and agreed</l>
     <l n="230">That the Patriarch , and he only , was the man to meet their need ;</l>
     <l n="231">So they sent and humbly prayed him if to come he would be</l>
     <l n="232">pleased ,</l>
     <l n="233">For his friend the Bishop Troilus was with sudden illness</l>
     <l n="234">seized .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="235">In his chamber lay the Bishop , sick in body , sick in mind ;</l>
     <l n="236">But the Patriarch , wise in spirit , had his malady divined .</l>
     <l n="237">So he came and sat beside him , patient still , but pale with</l>
     <l n="238">grief ,</l>
     <l n="239">While he made one last endeavour for that troubled soul 's</l>
     <l n="240">relief .</l>
     <l n="241">But his friend was sore and angry , and his words he would not</l>
     <l n="242">hear ,</l>
     <l n="243">For the presence now disturbed him that had lately been so dear .</l>
     <l n="244">And he lay with face averted , till he heard the Patriarch say ,</l>
     <l n="245">“ I have brought you back the money that you gave away to-day . ”</l>
     <l n="246">Then indeed he started wildly , and his eyes he opened wide ,</l>
     <l n="247">And he turned and faced his brother with a joy he could not</l>
     <l n="248">hide ;</l>
     <l n="249">For with sudden hope he trembled , and it paled his fevered</l>
     <l n="250">cheek ;</l>
     <l n="251">And the Patriarch 's heart was sinking , but he still went on to</l>
     <l n="252">speak :</l>
     <l n="253">“ When I asked your help this morning , I had nothing of my own ,</l>
     <l n="254">So I left to you the blessing which had else been mine alone ;</l>
     <l n="255">For those three dear orphan children I had gladly done the</l>
     <l n="256">whole ,</l>
     <l n="257">So their mother up in heaven might be praying for my soul .</l>
     <l n="258">And I now have come to ask you if this grace you will resign ,—</l>
     <l n="259">Will you take again the money , and let your good deed be mine ?</l>
     <l n="260">Yet I pray you to consider , ere you grant it or refuse ,</l>
     <l n="261">What a great and heavenly treasure I shall win and you will</l>
     <l n="262">lose ;</l>
     <l n="263">For indeed I would not wrong you , though to me the gain be</l>
     <l n="264">great .</l>
     <l n="265">So then do not answer rashly ,— there is time , we both can wait ,</l>
     <l n="266">And ‘ t were well to think a little on the words our Master said ,</l>
     <l n="267">How He left the poor behind , that we might serve them in His</l>
     <l n="268">stead ;</l>
     <l n="269">And whatever help we grant them , be it great or be it small ,</l>
     <l n="270">To our blessed Lord we give it , to our Lord , who gave us all . ”</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="271">Then made answer Bishop Troilus , “ As for what you now propose ,</l>
     <l n="272">If it please you I am ready , and the bargain we can close .</l>
     <l n="273">There are many kinds of service , and each needful in its way ,</l>
     <l n="274">And I think the Lord has set me in His church to preach and</l>
     <l n="275">pray ,</l>
     <l n="276">And to save the souls that perish , and to teach men how to live ,</l>
     <l n="277">While your own vocation , brother , is with open hand to give .</l>
     <l n="278">Let not one defraud the other , take your part and leave me mine ,</l>
     <l n="279">For however we may divide it , all the service is divine .</l>
     <l n="280">Let us feed God 's flock together , for His needy children care ,</l>
     <l n="281">I the souls , and you the bodies , so the burden we may share . ”</l>
     <l n="282">“ Then so be it , ” said the other , but his voice was low and</l>
     <l n="283">grave ,</l>
     <l n="284">And he prayed to God in silence for the soul he could not save .</l>
     <l n="285">“ We must write it all in order , we must sign and seal it too ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="288">So they wrote a contract solemn , to which each one signed his</l>

     <l n="290">In which he , the Bishop Troilus , did relinquish every claim</l>
     <l n="291">To whatever reward or merit his one pious deed had earned ,</l>
     <l n="292">Since the thirty golden pieces to his hand had been returned .</l>
     <l n="293">Then the Patriarch counted slowly all the pieces , one by one ,</l>
     <l n="294">In the open hand of Troilus , and his last attempt was done .</l>
     <l n="295">All had failed , and heavy-hearted from that chamber forth he</l>

     <l n="297">While his friend lay still and smiling in the fullness of</l>
     <l n="298">content ;</l>

     <l n="306">And he laid his hand upon them with a fond caressing touch .</l>
     <l n="307">But his thoughts began to wander , and his eyes were closing</l>

     <l n="312">And he saw the holy city , where the saints and angels dwell ;</l>
     <l n="313">Of its glory , of its beauty , mortal tongue can never tell .</l>
     <l n="314">There were palm-trees growing stately by the water , crystal</l>
     <l n="315">clear ;</l>
     <l n="316">There was music ever swelling , sometimes far and sometimes near ,</l>
     <l n="317">As it rose in mystic cadence from the hearts that overflowed</l>
     <l n="318">With the joy that reigns forever in their beautiful abode .</l>
     <l n="319">And the people of that city whom he met along the way</l>
     <l n="320">On the shining golden pavement , oh , how full of peace were they !</l>
     <l n="321">For he thought some heavenly vision shone forever in their</l>

     <l n="323">And he looked where they were gazing , but he only saw the light</l>
     <l n="324">As it flooded all with glory , and the air it seemed to fill ;</l>
     <l n="325">But he saw not what they looked on , for his eyes were mortal</l>
     <l n="326">still .</l>
     <l n="327">Now among those lighted faces there were some he knew before ,</l>
     <l n="328">Of the poor to whom so often he had closed his heart and door ;</l>
     <l n="329">Such as in the heavenly city he had little thought to find ,</l>
     <l n="330">For the sad and sick and needy had been never to his mind :</l>
     <l n="331">Of the rich were not so many , yet a few of these beside ,</l>
     <l n="332">Who by deeds of love and mercy had their Master glorified .</l>
     <l n="333">And in perfect health and beauty , among all that bright array ,</l>
     <l n="334">Was the woman he saw dying in the hospital that day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="335">All along the road he travelled , to the left and to the right ,</l>
     <l n="336">Rose the palaces they dwelt in , each a mansion of delight ,</l>
     <l n="337">But all varying in their beauty , far away as eye could reach ,</l>
     <l n="338">With a name in golden letters , high above the door of each .</l>
     <l n="339">And sweet faces smiled upon him , from the windows here and</l>
     <l n="340">there ,</l>
     <l n="341">Gentle faces free forever from the shade of earthly care ;</l>
     <l n="342">And he heard the happy voices of the children as they played</l>
     <l n="343">In the fair and peaceful gardens , where the roses never fade ;</l>
     <l n="344">And the things he left behind him seemed so very poor and small ,</l>
     <l n="345">That he wondered , in that glory , why men cared for them at all .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="346">But oh , wonder of all wonders , when he saw a name that shone</l>
     <l n="347">O'er a high and arching doorway , yes , a name that was his own !</l>
     <l n="348">Could it be his eyes deceived him ? No , he read it o'er and</l>
     <l n="349">o'er ;</l>
     <l n="350">“ This , ” it said , “ of Bishop Troilus is the home forevermore . ”</l>
     <l n="351">Oh the beauty of that palace , with such light and splendour</l>
     <l n="352">filled ,</l>
     <l n="353">That he thought the clouds of sunset had been hewn its walls to</l>
     <l n="354">gild ;</l>
     <l n="355">And the golden door stood open , he could catch a glimpse within</l>
     <l n="356">Of the vast illumined chambers where no foot had ever been .</l>
     <l n="357">He could only gaze bewildered , for the wonder was too great ,</l>
     <l n="358">And the joy so poured upon him he could hardly bear the weight .</l>
     <l n="359">Then he took one step toward it , but a servant of the King</l>
     <l n="360">Who from far-off earth that morning had returned on busy wing ,</l>
     <l n="361">And was bearing gifts and tokens from the scattered church</l>
     <l n="362">below ,</l>
     <l n="363">Came and passed and stood before him , in the courtyard 's golden</l>
     <l n="364">glow .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="365">Then he turned to his companions , for a few had gathered near ,</l>

     <l n="368">“ We must cancel that inscription from the stone , and write</l>

     <l n="371">And that thirty golden pieces were the price that he received . ”</l>
     <l n="372">Up then started Bishop Troilus , for his soul was sorely grieved ,</l>
     <l n="373">And he tried to speak , but could not , and awoke in his dismay ,</l>
     <l n="374">With his hand upon the money close beside him where he lay .</l>

     <l n="375">Now the long bright day was over ; as he saw the sun descend ,—</l>

     <l n="377">end .</l>
     <l n="378">He was walking in his garden where the freshening shadows lay ,</l>
     <l n="379">And the flowers that drooped at noontime stood erect in beauty</l>
     <l n="380">gay ;</l>
     <l n="381">But their brightness could not cheer him , and he bent his head</l>
     <l n="382">and sighed ,</l>
     <l n="383">For he thought , with wondering sadness , that the Lord his prayer</l>
     <l n="384">denied ,</l>

     <l n="393">How the Patriarch 's heart rebounded from the weight that on it</l>
     <l n="394">pressed ,</l>
     <l n="395">At the change so deep and sudden , in those broken words</l>
     <l n="396">expressed !</l>
     <l n="397">How his cheek grew red with gladness , how it smoothed his</l>

    </lg>

     <l n="403">And there Troilus , clinging closely to that strong and helpful</l>
     <l n="404">hand ,</l>
     <l n="405">Trusting in the heart that loved him and his thoughts could</l>
     <l n="406">understand ,</l>
     <l n="407">Told the story of his vision to his awed and listening friend ,—</l>
     <l n="408">All that dream of light and glory , with its sad , unlooked-for</l>
     <l n="409">end :</l>
     <l n="410">But his voice , which trembled ever , wellnigh failed him when he</l>
     <l n="411">told</l>
     <l n="412">Of the horror of that waking , with his hand upon the gold ;</l>
     <l n="413">When his eyes , long blind , were opened , and he saw the wreck</l>
     <l n="414">within ,</l>
     <l n="415">And one fearful moment , showed him what his wasted life had</l>
     <l n="416">been .</l>
     <l n="417">“ Now , ” he said , “ my courage fails me when I think to mend my</l>

     <l n="424">And he looked with eyes beseeching at the Patriarch , who replied</l>
     <l n="425">With a smile that fell like sunshine on the faint heart by his</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">

     <l n="446">Gave himself and all his substance to the service of the Lord ;</l>
     <l n="447">Yet in his own strength mistrusting , he implored his friend anew</l>

     <l n="453">There was no more train about him when he walked the city</l>
     <l n="454">through ,</l>
     <l n="455">For the priests who once attended now had better work to do ;</l>
     <l n="456">And the ladies cared no longer from their balconies to lean ,</l>
     <l n="457">When of worldly pomp and splendour there was nothing to be seen .</l>
     <l n="458">For the cross of many jewels on his bosom shone no more ,</l>

     <l n="464">So his closing days were happy , after years of sordid care ,</l>

     <l n="467">And he lightened many a burden , and he righted many a wrong ,</l>
     <l n="468">And the wealth became a blessing that had been a curse so long ;</l>
     <l n="469">And his secret hoard was scattered , and men said that he died</l>
     <l n="470">poor ,</l>
     <l n="471">But he found great wealth in heaven at the end , we may be sure .</l>

     <l n="472">* The Crosses on the Wall *</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>This beautiful legend has for me a most peculiar interest , owing to the circumstances under which I first heard it . It was taught to me by a very dear young friend whom I had known and loved from his infancy ,— Piero , the only surviving child of Count Giuseppe Pasolini Zanelli of Faenza . It was only last October — eight months ago — and we were all staying together in the home of his beloved and still beautiful grandmother , at Bassano , in the Veneto . It was the last evening that we expected to pass together , and Pierino ( we had never been able to give up calling him by that childish diminutive ) brought a book with him , a collection of popular legends compiled by De Gubernatis , and said that he had a story to read us . It was “ The Crosses on the Wall , ” and it has always seemed to me as though he read it on that particular evening to prepare us for what was to come . For some months he had been not quite so strong as usual , yet no one felt any particular apprehension , until on the twenty-eighth of November he died , almost without warning . He was twenty-two years old , of a very beautiful character ,— so good that we ought to have known he was not for us .</p>
   <p>With him two great and ancient families come to an end ,— the Pasolini-Zanelli of Faenza , and the Baroni-Semitecolo of Bassano : these last are the only descendants of that Semitecolo who worked in mosaic at Torcello .</p>

     <l n="85">On the pile a few gray ashes , that it might not boil too fast .</l>
     <l n="86">But the touch of sleep was on her , she was dreaming while she</l>

     <l n="88">And the wooden spoon kept falling from her limp and listless</l>
     <l n="89">hand .</l>

     <l n="93">But another fear assailed her — what if she should faint or fall ?</l>
     <l n="94">And to-night the storm-swept cottage seems so far away from all !</l>
     <l n="95">How the fitful wind is moaning ! And between the gusts that</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="98">And her head is aching strangely , as it never did before :</l>

     <l n="107">‘ T was in vain ; for sleep had conquered , and the words she tried</l>
     <l n="108">to say</l>
     <l n="109">First became a drowsy murmur , then grew faint and died away .</l>
     <l n="110">And she slept as sleep the weary , heedless how the night went</l>

     <l n="112">With her pitcher all untended , with her labour all undone ;</l>

     <l n="119">It was long she sat there sleeping — do you think her work was</l>
     <l n="120">spoiled ?</l>
     <l n="121">No , the fir-wood fire kept burning , and the pitcher gently</l>
     <l n="122">boiled :</l>

     <l n="126">guilt .</l>
     <l n="127">But her eyes , when first they opened , saw a vision , strange and</l>
     <l n="128">sweet ,</l>
     <l n="129">For a little Child was standing on the hearth-stone at her feet .</l>
     <l n="130">And He seemed no earthly infant , for His robe was like the snow ,</l>
     <l n="131">And a glory shone about Him that was not the firelight glow .</l>
     <l n="132">And Himself her work was doing ! For He kept the fire alive ,</l>
     <l n="133">And He watched the earthen pitcher , that no danger might arrive</l>
     <l n="134">To the simple meal , now ready , with the coals around it piled ;</l>
     <l n="135">Then He turned His face toward her , and she knew the Holy Child .</l>
     <l n="136">‘ T was her Lord who stood before her ! And she did not shrink</l>
     <l n="137">nor start —</l>
     <l n="138">There was more of joy than wonder in her all-believing heart .</l>
     <l n="139">When her willing hands were weary , when her patient eyes were</l>
     <l n="140">closed ,</l>
     <l n="141">He had finished all she failed in , He had watched while she</l>
     <l n="142">reposed .</l>
     <l n="143">Do you ask of His appearance ? Human words are weak and cold ;</l>
     <l n="144">‘ T is enough to say she knew Him — that is all she ever told .</l>
     <l n="145">Yes , as you and I will know Him when that happy day shall come ,</l>
     <l n="146">When , if we on earth have loved Him , He will bid us welcome</l>
