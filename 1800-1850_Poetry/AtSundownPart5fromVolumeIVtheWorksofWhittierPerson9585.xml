    <head>THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888 .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Low in the east , against a white , cold dawn ,</l>
     <l n="2">The black-lined silhouette of the woods was drawn ,</l>
     <l n="3">And on a wintry waste</l>
     <l n="4">Of frosted streams and hillsides bare and brown ,</l>
     <l n="5">Through thin cloud-films , a pallid ghost looked down ,</l>
     <l n="6">The waning moon half-faced !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">In that pale sky and sere , snow-waiting earth ,</l>
     <l n="8">What sign was there of the immortal birth ?</l>
     <l n="9">What herald of the One ?</l>
     <l n="10">Lo ! swift as thought the heavenly radiance came ,</l>
     <l n="11">A rose-red splendor swept the sky like flame ,</l>
     <l n="12">Up rolled the round , bright sun !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">And all was changed . From a transfigured world</l>
     <l n="14">The moon 's ghost fled , the smoke of home-hearths curled</l>
     <l n="15">Up the still air unblown .</l>
     <l n="16">In Orient warmth and brightness , did that morn</l>
     <l n="17">O'er Nain and Nazareth , when the Christ was born ,</l>
     <l n="18">Break fairer than our own ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">The morning 's promise noon and eve fulfilled</l>
     <l n="20">In warm , soft sky and landscape hazy-hilled</l>
     <l n="21">And sunset fair as they ;</l>
     <l n="22">A sweet reminder of His holiest time ,</l>
     <l n="23">A summer-miracle in our winter clime ,</l>
     <l n="24">God gave a perfect day .</l>

    <head>THE VOW OF WASHINGTON .</head>
    <head>Read in New York , April 30 , 1889 , at the Centennial Celebration of the Inauguration of George Washington as the first President of the United States .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The sword was sheathed : in April 's sun</l>
     <l n="2">Lay green the fields by Freedom won ;</l>
     <l n="3">And severed sections , weary of debates ,</l>
     <l n="4">Joined hands at last and were United States .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">O City sitting by the Sea</l>
     <l n="6">How proud the day that dawned on thee ,</l>
     <l n="7">When the new era , long desired , began ,</l>
     <l n="8">And , in its need , the hour had found the man !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">One thought the cannon salvos spoke ,</l>
     <l n="10">The resonant bell-tower 's vibrant stroke ,</l>
     <l n="11">The voiceful streets , the plaudit-echoing halls ,</l>
     <l n="12">And prayer and hymn borne heavenward from St. Paul 's !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">How felt the land in every part</l>
     <l n="14">The strong throb of a nation 's heart ,</l>
     <l n="15">As its great leader gave , with reverent awe ,</l>
     <l n="16">His pledge to Union , Liberty , and Law .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">That pledge the heavens above him heard ,</l>

     <l n="20">Their gaze on Freedom 's great experiment .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">Could it succeed ? Of honor sold</l>
     <l n="22">And hopes deceived all history told .</l>
     <l n="23">Above the wrecks that strewed the mournful past ,</l>

     <l n="25">Thank God ! the people 's choice was just ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">His rule of justice , order , peace ,</l>

     <l n="32">And rule , alone , which serves the ruled , is just ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">That Freedom generous is , but strong</l>
     <l n="34">In hate of fraud and selfish wrong ,</l>
     <l n="35">Pretence that turns her holy truths to lies ,</l>
     <l n="36">And lawless license masking in her guise .</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="37">Land of his love ! with one glad voice</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="49">And in its broad and sheltering shade ,</l>
     <l n="50">Sitting with none to make afraid ,</l>
     <l n="51">Were we now silent , through each mighty limb ,</l>
     <l n="52">The winds of heaven would sing the praise of him .</l>

     <l n="61">The change for which he prayed and sought</l>

     <l n="65">One people now , all doubt beyond ,</l>

     <l n="69">For rule and trust must needs be ours ;</l>

     <l n="72">Of Duty rests on each and all the same .</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="73">Then let the sovereign millions , where</l>
     <l n="74">Our banner floats in sun and air ,</l>
     <l n="75">From the warm palm-lands to Alaska 's cold ,</l>
     <l n="76">Repeat with us the pledge a century old ?</l>

    <head>THE CAPTAIN 'S WELL .</head>
    <head>The story of the shipwreck of Captain Valentine Bagley , on the coast of Arabia , and his sufferings in the desert , has been familiar from my childhood . It has been partially told in the singularly beautiful lines of my friend , Harriet Prescott Spofford , an the occasion of a public celebration at the Newburyport Library . To the charm and felicity of her verse , as far as it goes , nothing can be added ; but in the following ballad I have endeavored to give a fuller detail of the touching incident upon which it is founded .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">From pain and peril , by land and main ,</l>
     <l n="2">The shipwrecked sailor came back again ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">And like one from the dead , the threshold cross 'd</l>
     <l n="4">Of his wondering home , that had mourned him lost .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">Where he sat once more with his kith and kin ,</l>
     <l n="6">And welcomed his neighbors thronging in .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="7">But when morning came he called for his spade .</l>
     <l n="8">“ I must pay my debt to the Lord , ” he said .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="9">“ Why dig you here ? ” asked the passer-by ;</l>
     <l n="10">“ Is there gold or silver the road so nigh ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="11">“ No , friend , ” he answered : “ but under this sod</l>
     <l n="12">Is the blessed water , the wine of God . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="13">“ Water ! the Powow is at your back ,</l>
     <l n="14">And right before you the Merrimac ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="15">“ And look you up , or look you down ,</l>
     <l n="16">There ‘ s a well-sweep at every door in town . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="17">“ True , ” he said , “ we have wells of our own ;</l>
     <l n="18">But this I dig for the Lord alone . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="19">Said the other : “ This soil is dry , you know .</l>
     <l n="20">I doubt if a spring can be found below ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="21">“ You had better consult , before you dig ,</l>
     <l n="22">Some water-witch , with a hazel twig . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="23">“ No , wet or dry , I will dig it here ,</l>
     <l n="24">Shallow or deep , if it takes a year .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="25">“ In the Arab desert , where shade is none ,</l>
     <l n="26">The waterless land of sand and sun ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="27">“ Under the pitiless , brazen sky</l>
     <l n="28">My burning throat as the sand was dry ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="29">“ My crazed brain listened in fever dreams</l>
     <l n="30">For plash of buckets and ripple of streams ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="31">“ And opening my eyes to the blinding glare ,</l>
     <l n="32">And my lips to the breath of the blistering air ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="33">“ Tortured alike by the heavens and earth ,</l>
     <l n="34">I cursed , like Job , the day of my birth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="35">“ Then something tender , and sad , and mild</l>
     <l n="36">As a mother 's voice to her wandering child ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="37">“ Rebuked my frenzy ; and bowing my head ,</l>
     <l n="38">I prayed as I never before had prayed :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="39">“ Pity me , God ! for I die of thirst ;</l>
     <l n="40">Take me out of this land accurst ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="41">“ And if ever I reach my home again ,</l>
     <l n="42">Where earth has springs , and the sky has rain ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="43">“ I will dig a well for the passers-by ,</l>
     <l n="44">And none shall suffer from thirst as I .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="45">“ I saw , as I prayed , my home once more ,</l>
     <l n="46">The house , the barn , the elms by the door ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="47">“ The grass-lined road , that riverward wound ,</l>
     <l n="48">The tall slate stones of the burying-ground ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="49">“ The belfry and steeple on meeting-house hill ,</l>
     <l n="50">The brook with its dam , and gray grist mill ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="51">“ And I knew in that vision beyond the sea ,</l>
     <l n="52">The very place where my well must be .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="53">“ God heard my prayer in that evil day ;</l>
     <l n="54">He led my feet in their homeward way ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="55">“ From false mirage and dried-up well ,</l>
     <l n="56">And the hot sand storms of a land of hell ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="57">“ Till I saw at last through the coast-hill 's gap ,</l>
     <l n="58">A city held in its stony lap ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="59">“ The mosques and the domes of scorched Muscat ,</l>
     <l n="60">And my heart leaped up with joy thereat ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="61">“ For there was a ship at anchor lying ,</l>
     <l n="62">A Christian flag at its mast-head flying ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="63">“ And sweetest of sounds to my homesick ear</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="33">
     <l n="65">“ Now the Lord be thanked , I am back again ,</l>

     <l n="69">His kindred wept , and his neighbors said</l>

     <l n="71">But from morn to noon , and from noon to night ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="37">
     <l n="73">And when at last , from the loosened earth ,</l>
     <l n="74">Under his spade the stream gushed forth ,</l>

     <l n="75">And fast as he climbed to his deep well 's brim ,</l>

     <l n="77">He shouted for joy : “ I have kept my word ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="40">
     <l n="79">The long years came and the long years went ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="41">
     <l n="81">He watched the travellers , heat-oppressed ,</l>

     <l n="1">On these green banks , where falls too soon</l>

     <l n="4">The water gliding at nay feet ,</l>

     <l n="9">The valley 's stretch of shade and gleam</l>

     <l n="25">Midway ‘ twixt child and maiden yet ,</l>
