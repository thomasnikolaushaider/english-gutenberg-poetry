     <p>BROWNIES , like fairies and goblins , are imaginary little sprites , who are supposed to delight in harmless pranks and helpful deeds . They work and sport while weary households sleep , and never allow themselves to be seen by mortal eyes .</p>

     <l n="1">ONE night a cunning Brownie band</l>

     <l n="17">Takes all his corn and wheat to mill ;</l>
