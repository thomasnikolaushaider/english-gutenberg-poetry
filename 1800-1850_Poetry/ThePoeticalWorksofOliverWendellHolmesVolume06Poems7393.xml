    <head>THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">THIS is the ship of pearl , which , poets feign ,</l>
     <l n="2">Sails the unshadowed main ,—</l>
     <l n="3">The venturous bark that flings</l>
     <l n="4">On the sweet summer wind its purpled wings</l>
     <l n="5">In gulfs enchanted , where the Siren sings ,</l>
     <l n="6">And coral reefs lie bare ,</l>
     <l n="7">Where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">Its webs of living gauze no more unfurl ;</l>
     <l n="9">Wrecked is the ship of pearl !</l>
     <l n="10">And every chambered cell ,</l>
     <l n="11">Where its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell ,</l>
     <l n="12">As the frail tenant shaped his growing shell ,</l>
     <l n="13">Before thee lies revealed ,—</l>
     <l n="14">Its irised ceiling rent , its sunless crypt unsealed !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">Year after year beheld the silent toil</l>
     <l n="16">That spread his lustrous coil ;</l>
     <l n="17">Still , as the spiral grew ,</l>
     <l n="18">He left the past year 's dwelling for the new ,</l>
     <l n="19">Stole with soft step its shining archway through ,</l>
     <l n="20">Built up its idle door ,</l>
     <l n="21">Stretched in his last-found home , and knew the old no more .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="22">Thanks for the heavenly message brought by thee ,</l>
     <l n="23">Child of the wandering sea ,</l>
     <l n="24">Cast from her lap , forlorn !</l>
     <l n="25">From thy dead lips a clearer note is born</l>
     <l n="26">Than ever Triton blew from wreathed horn</l>
     <l n="27">While on mine ear it rings ,</l>
     <l n="28">Through the deep caves of thought I hear a voice that sings :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="29">Build thee more stately mansions , O my soul ,</l>
     <l n="30">As the swift seasons roll !</l>
     <l n="31">Leave thy low-vaulted past !</l>
     <l n="32">Let each new temple , nobler than the last ,</l>
     <l n="33">Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast ,</l>
     <l n="34">Till thou at length art free ,</l>
     <l n="35">Leaving thine outgrown shell by life 's unresting sea !</l>

    <head>SUN AND SHADOW</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">As I look from the isle , o'er its billows of green ,</l>
     <l n="2">To the billows of foam-crested blue ,</l>
     <l n="3">Yon bark , that afar in the distance is seen ,</l>
     <l n="4">Half dreaming , my eyes will pursue</l>
     <l n="5">Now dark in the shadow , she scatters the spray</l>
     <l n="6">As the chaff in the stroke of the flail ;</l>
     <l n="7">Now white as the sea-gull , she flies on her way ,</l>
     <l n="8">The sun gleaming bright on her sail .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Yet her pilot is thinking of dangers to shun ,—</l>
     <l n="10">Of breakers that whiten and roar ;</l>
     <l n="11">How little he cares , if in shadow or sun</l>
     <l n="12">They see him who gaze from the shore !</l>
     <l n="13">He looks to the beacon that looms from the reef ,</l>
     <l n="14">To the rock that is under his lee ,</l>
     <l n="15">As he drifts on the blast , like a wind-wafted leaf ,</l>
     <l n="16">O'er the gulfs of the desolate sea .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Thus drifting afar to the dim-vaulted caves</l>
     <l n="18">Where life and its ventures are laid ,</l>
     <l n="19">The dreamers who gaze while we battle the waves</l>
     <l n="20">May see us in sunshine or shade ;</l>
     <l n="21">Yet true to our course , though the shadows grow dark ,</l>
     <l n="22">We 'll trim our broad sail as before ,</l>
     <l n="23">And stand by the rudder that governs the bark ,</l>
     <l n="24">Nor ask how we look from the shore !</l>
    </lg>

    <head>MUSA</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">O MY lost beauty !— hast thou folded quite</l>
     <l n="2">Thy wings of morning light</l>
     <l n="3">Beyond those iron gates</l>
     <l n="4">Where Life crowds hurrying to the haggard Fates ,</l>
     <l n="5">And Age upon his mound of ashes waits</l>
     <l n="6">To chill our fiery dreams ,</l>
     <l n="7">Hot from the heart of youth plunged in his icy streams ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">Leave me not fading in these weeds of care ,</l>
     <l n="9">Whose flowers are silvered hair !</l>
     <l n="10">Have I not loved thee long ,</l>
     <l n="11">Though my young lips have often done thee wrong ,</l>
     <l n="12">And vexed thy heaven-tuned ear with careless song ?</l>
     <l n="13">Ah , wilt thou yet return ,</l>
     <l n="14">Bearing thy rose-hued torch , and bid thine altar burn ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">Come to me !— I will flood thy silent shrine</l>
     <l n="16">With my soul 's sacred wine ,</l>
     <l n="17">And heap thy marble floors</l>
     <l n="18">As the wild spice-trees waste their fragrant stores ,</l>
     <l n="19">In leafy islands walled with madrepores</l>
     <l n="20">And lapped in Orient seas ,</l>
     <l n="21">When all their feathery palms toss , plume-like , in the breeze .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="22">Come to me !— thou shalt feed on honeyed words ,</l>
     <l n="23">Sweeter than song of birds ;—</l>
     <l n="24">No wailing bulbul 's throat ,</l>
     <l n="25">No melting dulcimer 's melodious note</l>
     <l n="26">When o'er the midnight wave its murmurs float ,</l>
     <l n="27">Thy ravished sense might soothe</l>
     <l n="28">With flow so liquid-soft , with strain so velvet-smooth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="29">Thou shalt be decked with jewels , like a queen ,</l>
     <l n="30">Sought in those bowers of green</l>
     <l n="31">Where loop the clustered vines</l>
     <l n="32">And the close-clinging dulcamara twines ,—</l>
     <l n="33">Pure pearls of Maydew where the moonlight shines ,</l>
     <l n="34">And Summer 's fruited gems ,</l>
     <l n="35">And coral pendants shorn from Autumn 's berried stems .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="36">Sit by me drifting on the sleepy waves ,—</l>
     <l n="37">Or stretched by grass-grown graves ,</l>
     <l n="38">Whose gray , high-shouldered stones ,</l>
     <l n="39">Carved with old names Life 's time-worn roll disowns ,</l>
     <l n="40">Lean , lichen-spotted , o'er the crumbled bones</l>
     <l n="41">Still slumbering where they lay</l>
     <l n="42">While the sad Pilgrim watched to scare the wolf away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="43">Spread o'er my couch thy visionary wing !</l>
     <l n="44">Still let me dream and sing ,—</l>
     <l n="45">Dream of that winding shore</l>
     <l n="46">Where scarlet cardinals bloom-for me no more ,—</l>
     <l n="47">The stream with heaven beneath its liquid floor ,</l>
     <l n="48">And clustering nenuphars</l>
     <l n="49">Sprinkling its mirrored blue like golden-chaliced stars !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="50">Come while their balms the linden-blossoms shed !—</l>
     <l n="51">Come while the rose is red ,—</l>
     <l n="52">While blue-eyed Summer smiles</l>
     <l n="53">On the green ripples round yon sunken piles</l>
     <l n="54">Washed by the moon-wave warm from Indian isles ,</l>
     <l n="55">And on the sultry air</l>
     <l n="56">The chestnuts spread their palms like holy men in prayer !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="57">Oh for thy burning lips to fire my brain</l>
     <l n="58">With thrills of wild , sweet pain !—</l>
     <l n="59">On life 's autumnal blast ,</l>
     <l n="60">Like shrivelled leaves , youth 's passion-flowers are cast ,—</l>
     <l n="61">Once loving thee , we love thee to the last !—</l>
     <l n="62">Behold thy new-decked shrine ,</l>
     <l n="63">And hear once more the voice that breathed “ Forever thine ! ”</l>

    <head>A PARTING HEALTH</head>
    <head>TO J. L. MOTLEY</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">YES , we knew we must lose him ,— though friendship may claim</l>
     <l n="2">To blend her green leaves with the laurels of fame ;</l>
     <l n="3">Though fondly , at parting , we call him our own ,</l>
     <l n="4">‘ T is the whisper of love when the bugle has blown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">As the rider that rests with the spur on his heel ,</l>
     <l n="6">As the guardsman that sleeps in his corselet of steel ,</l>
     <l n="7">As the archer that stands with his shaft on the string ,</l>
     <l n="8">He stoops from his toil to the garland we bring .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">What pictures yet slumber unborn in his loom ,</l>
     <l n="10">Till their warriors shall breathe and their beauties shall bloom ,</l>
     <l n="11">While the tapestry lengthens the life-glowing dyes</l>
     <l n="12">That caught from our sunsets the stain of their skies !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">In the alcoves of death , in the charnels of timid ,</l>
     <l n="14">Where flit the gaunt spectres of passion and crime ,</l>
     <l n="15">There are triumphs untold , there are martyrs unsung ,</l>
     <l n="16">There are heroes yet silent to speak with his tongue !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Let us hear the proud story which time has bequeathed !</l>
     <l n="18">From lips that are warm with the freedom they breathed !</l>
     <l n="19">Let him summon its tyrants , and tell us their doom ,</l>
     <l n="20">Though he sweep the black past like Van Tromp with his broom !</l>

     <l n="23">On pampas , on prairie , o'er mountain and lake ,</l>
     <l n="24">To bathe the swift bark , like a sea-girdled shrine ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">That sunshine had a heavenly glow ,</l>
     <l n="6">Which faded with those “ good old days ”</l>

     <l n="5">I ‘ ll tell you what happened without delay ,</l>
     <l n="6">Scaring the parson into fits ,</l>
     <l n="7">Frightening people out of their wits ,—</l>

     <l n="9">Seventeen hundred and fifty-five .</l>
     <l n="10">Georgius Secundus was then alive ,—</l>
     <l n="11">Snuffy old drone from the German hive .</l>
     <l n="12">That was the year when Lisbon-town</l>
     <l n="13">Saw the earth open and gulp her down ,</l>
     <l n="14">And Braddock 's army was done so brown ,</l>
     <l n="15">Left without a scalp to its crown .</l>
     <l n="16">It was on the terrible Earthquake-day</l>
     <l n="17">That the Deacon finished the one-hoss shay .</l>

     <l n="18">Now in building of chaises , I tell you what ,</l>
     <l n="19">There is always somewhere a weakest spot ,—</l>

     <l n="21">In panel , or crossbar , or floor , or sill ,</l>

     <l n="24">Above or below , or within or without ,—</l>
     <l n="25">And that ‘ s the reason , beyond a doubt ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="27">But the Deacon swore ( as Deacons do ,</l>

     <l n="29">He would build one shay to beat the taown</l>

     <l n="40">That was for spokes and floor and sills ;</l>
     <l n="41">He sent for lancewood to make the thills ;</l>
     <l n="42">The crossbars were ash , from the straightest trees ,</l>
     <l n="43">The panels of white-wood , that cuts like cheese ,</l>
     <l n="44">But lasts like iron for things like these ;</l>
     <l n="45">The hubs of logs from the “ Settler 's ellum , ” —</l>
     <l n="46">Last of its timber ,— they could  n't sell ‘ em ,</l>
     <l n="47">Never an axe had seen their chips ,</l>
     <l n="48">And the wedges flew from between their lips ,</l>

     <l n="54">Boot , top , dasher , from tough old hide</l>
     <l n="55">Found in the pit when the tanner died .</l>
     <l n="56">That was the way he “ put her through . ”</l>

     <l n="58">Do ! I tell you , I rather guess</l>
     <l n="59">She was a wonder , and nothing less !</l>
     <l n="60">Colts grew horses , beards turned gray ,</l>
     <l n="61">Deacon and deaconess dropped away ,</l>
     <l n="62">Children and grandchildren — where were they ?</l>
     <l n="63">But there stood the stout old one-hoss shay</l>

    <head>HOMESICK IN HEAVEN</head>
    <head>THE DIVINE VOICE Go seek thine earth-born sisters ,— thus the Voice That all obey ,— the sad and silent three ; These only , while the hosts of Heaven rejoice , Smile never ; ask them what their sorrows be ;</head>
     <l n="1">And when the secret of their griefs they tell ,</l>
     <l n="2">Look on them with thy mild , half-human eyes ;</l>
     <l n="3">Say what thou wast on earth ; thou knowest well ;</l>
     <l n="4">So shall they cease from unavailing sighs .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>THE ANGEL Why thus , apart ,— the swift-winged herald spake ,— Sit ye with silent lips and unstrung lyres While the trisagion 's blending chords awake In shouts of joy from all the heavenly choirs ?</p>
   <p>FIRST SPIRIT Chide not thy sisters ,— thus the answer came ;— Children of earth , our half-weaned nature clings To earth 's fond memories , and her whispered name Untunes our quivering lips , our saddened strings ;</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">For there we loved , and where we love is home ,</l>
     <l n="2">Home that our feet may leave , but not our hearts ,</l>

     <l n="4">The chain may lengthen , but it never parts !</l>

     <l n="5">Sometimes a sunlit sphere comes rolling by ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">To catch , perchance , some flashing glimpse of green ,</l>

     <l n="12">The blinding splendors and the changeless blue .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>THE ANGEL Nay , sister , nay ! a single healing leaf Plucked from the bough of yon twelve-fruited tree Would soothe such anguish ,— deeper stabbing grief Has pierced thy throbbing heart —</p>
   <p>THE FIRST SPIRIT Ah , woe is me ! I from my clinging babe was rudely torn ; His tender lips a loveless bosom pressed ; Can I forget him in my life new born ? Oh that my darling lay upon my breast !</p>
   <p>THE ANGEL And thou ?—</p>
   <p>THE SECOND SPIRIT I was a fair and youthful bride , The kiss of love still burns upon my cheek , He whom I worshipped , ever at my side ,— Him through the spirit realm in vain I seek .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Sweet faces turn their beaming eyes on mine ;</l>
     <l n="2">Ah ! not in these the wished-for look I read ;</l>
     <l n="3">Still for that one dear human smile I pine ;</l>
     <l n="4">Thou and none other !— is the lover 's creed .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>THE ANGEL And whence thy sadness in a world of bliss Where never parting comes , nor mourner 's tear ? Art thou , too , dreaming of a mortal 's kiss Amid the seraphs of the heavenly sphere ?</p>
   <p>THE THIRD SPIRIT Nay , tax not me with passion 's wasting fire ; When the swift message set my spirit free , Blind , helpless , lone , I left my gray-haired sire ; My friends were many , he had none save me .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">I left him , orphaned , in the starless night ;</l>
     <l n="2">Alas , for him no cheerful morning 's dawn</l>
     <l n="3">I wear the ransomed spirit 's robe of white ,</l>
     <l n="4">Yet still I hear him moaning , She is gone !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>THE ANGEL Ye know me not , sweet sisters ?— All in vain Ye seek your lost ones in the shapes they wore ; The flower once opened may not bud again , The fruit once fallen finds the stem no more .</p>

     <l n="65">His pitying angel shows the clerk of Heaven .</l>
     <l n="66">The noblest service comes from nameless hands ,</l>

     <l n="72">Who gave the dragging car its rolling wheel ,</l>
     <l n="73">And tamed the steed that whirls its circling round ?</l>
     <l n="74">All these have left their work and not their names ,—</l>
     <l n="75">Why should I murmur at a fate like theirs ?</l>
     <l n="76">This is the heavenly light ; the pearly stain</l>
     <l n="77">Was but a wind-cloud drifting o'er the stars !</l>

     <l n="2">That made me what I am . A man most wise ,</l>
     <l n="3">But overworn with toil and bent with age ,</l>
     <l n="4">Sought me to be his scholar , - me , run wild</l>
     <l n="5">From books and teachers , - kindled in my soul</l>
     <l n="6">The love of knowledge ; led me to his tower ,</l>
     <l n="7">Showed me the wonders of the midnight realm</l>
     <l n="8">His hollow sceptre ruled , or seemed to rule ,</l>
     <l n="9">Taught me the mighty secrets of the spheres ,</l>
     <l n="10">Trained me to find the glimmering specks of light</l>
     <l n="11">Beyond the unaided sense , and on my chart</l>
     <l n="12">To string them one by one , in order due ,</l>
     <l n="13">As on a rosary a saint his beads .</l>
     <l n="14">I was his only scholar ; I became</l>
     <l n="15">The echo to his thought ; whate'er he knew</l>
     <l n="16">Was mine for asking ; so from year to year</l>
     <l n="17">W e wrought together , till there came a time</l>

     <l n="24">I learned his annual and his monthly tale ,</l>
     <l n="25">His weekly axiom and his daily phrase ,</l>
     <l n="26">I felt them coming in the laden air ,</l>

     <l n="38">I was his eye , his ear , his cunning hand ,</l>
     <l n="39">Love was my spur and longing after fame ,</l>
     <l n="40">But his the goading thorn of sleepless age</l>
     <l n="41">That sees its shortening span , its lengthening shades ,</l>
     <l n="42">That clutches what it may with eager grasp ,</l>
     <l n="43">And drops at last with empty , outstretched hands .</l>
     <l n="44">All this he dreamed not . He would sit him down</l>
     <l n="45">Thinking to work his problems as of old ,</l>
     <l n="46">And find the star he thought so plain a blur ,</l>
     <l n="47">The columned figures labyrinthine wilds</l>
     <l n="48">Without my comment , blind and senseless scrawls</l>
     <l n="49">That vexed him with their riddles ; he would strive</l>
     <l n="50">And struggle for a while , and then his eye</l>
     <l n="51">Would lose its light , and over all his mind</l>
     <l n="52">The cold gray mist would settle ; and erelong</l>
     <l n="53">The darkness fell , and I was left alone .</l>

     <l n="12">That smile and whisper round us in our dreams .</l>
     <l n="13">Thus have I learned to search if I may know</l>
     <l n="14">The whence and why of all beneath the stars</l>
     <l n="15">And all beyond them , and to weigh my life</l>
     <l n="16">As in a balance ,— poising good and ill</l>
     <l n="17">Against each other ,— asking of the Power</l>

     <l n="19">If I am heir to any inborn right ,</l>
     <l n="20">Or only as an atom of the dust</l>

     <l n="51">The door he seeks , forgetful of his sin ,</l>
     <l n="52">Longing to clasp him in a father 's arms ,</l>

     <l n="54">Four gospels tell their story to mankind ,</l>
     <l n="55">And none so full of soft , caressing words</l>
     <l n="56">That bring the Maid of Bethlehem and her Babe</l>
     <l n="57">Before our tear-dimmed eyes , as his who learned</l>
     <l n="58">In the meek service of his gracious art</l>
     <l n="59">The tones which , like the medicinal balms</l>
     <l n="60">That calm the sufferer 's anguish , soothe our souls .</l>
     <l n="61">Oh that the loving woman , she who sat</l>
     <l n="62">So long a listener at her Master 's feet ,</l>
     <l n="63">Had left us Mary 's Gospel ,— all she heard</l>
     <l n="64">Too sweet , too subtle for the ear of man !</l>
     <l n="65">Mark how the tender-hearted mothers read</l>
     <l n="66">The messages of love between the lines</l>
     <l n="67">Of the same page that loads the bitter tongue</l>
     <l n="68">Of him who deals in terror as his trade</l>
     <l n="69">With threatening words of wrath that scorch like flame</l>
     <l n="70">They tell of angels whispering round the bed</l>
     <l n="71">Of the sweet infant smiling in its dream ,</l>
     <l n="72">Of lambs enfolded in the Shepherd 's arms ,</l>
     <l n="73">Of Him who blessed the children ; of the land</l>
     <l n="74">Where crystal rivers feed unfading flowers ,</l>
     <l n="75">Of cities golden-paved with streets of pearl ,</l>
     <l n="76">Of the white robes the winged creatures wear ,</l>
     <l n="77">The crowns and harps from whose melodious strings</l>
     <l n="78">One long , sweet anthem flows forevermore !</l>
     <l n="79">We too had human mothers , even as Thou ,</l>
     <l n="80">Whom we have learned to worship as remote</l>
     <l n="81">From mortal kindred , wast a cradled babe .</l>
     <l n="82">The milk of woman filled our branching veins ,</l>
     <l n="83">She lulled us with her tender nursery-song ,</l>
     <l n="84">And folded round us her untiring arms ,</l>
     <l n="85">While the first unremembered twilight yeas</l>
     <l n="86">Shaped us to conscious being ; still we feel</l>
     <l n="87">Her pulses in our own ,— too faintly feel ;</l>
     <l n="88">Would that the heart of woman warmed our creeds !</l>

     <l n="92">They battle for God 's glory and their own ,</l>
     <l n="93">Till , sick of wordy strife , a show of hands</l>
     <l n="94">Fixes the faith of ages yet unborn ,—</l>
     <l n="95">Ah , not from these the listening soul can hear</l>
     <l n="96">The Father 's voice that speaks itself divine !</l>
     <l n="97">Love must be still our Master ; till we learn</l>
     <l n="98">What he can teach us of a woman 's heart ,</l>

     <l n="1">Anno Domini 1972</l>
   </lg>
   <p>A CRAZY bookcase , placed before A low-price dealer 's open door ; Therein arrayed in broken rows A ragged crew of rhyme and prose , The homeless vagrants , waifs , and strays Whose low estate this line betrays ( Set forth the lesser birds to lime ) YOUR CHOICE AMONG THESE BOORS 1 DIME !</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Ho ! dealer ; for its motto 's sake</l>
     <l n="2">This scarecrow from the shelf I take ;</l>
     <l n="3">Three starveling volumes bound in one ,</l>
     <l n="4">Its covers warping in the sun .</l>
     <l n="5">Methinks it hath a musty smell ,</l>
     <l n="6">I like its flavor none too well ,</l>
     <l n="7">But Yorick 's brain was far from dull ,</l>
     <l n="8">Though Hamlet pah ! ' d , and dropped his skull .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Why , here comes rain ! The sky grows dark ,—</l>
     <l n="10">Was that the roll of thunder ? Hark !</l>
     <l n="11">The shop affords a safe retreat ,</l>
     <l n="12">A chair extends its welcome seat ,</l>
     <l n="13">The tradesman has a civil look</l>
     <l n="14">( I ‘ ve paid , impromptu , for my book ) ,</l>
     <l n="15">The clouds portend a sudden shower ,—</l>
     <l n="16">I ‘ ll read my purchase for an hour .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">What have I rescued from the shelf ?</l>
     <l n="18">A Boswell , writing out himself !</l>
     <l n="19">For though he changes dress and name ,</l>
     <l n="20">The man beneath is still the same ,</l>
     <l n="21">Laughing or sad , by fits and starts ,</l>
     <l n="22">One actor in a dozen parts ,</l>
     <l n="23">And whatsoe'er the mask may be ,</l>
     <l n="24">The voice assures us , This is he .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">I say not this to cry him down ;</l>
     <l n="26">I find my Shakespeare in his clown ,</l>
     <l n="27">His rogues the selfsame parent own ;</l>
     <l n="28">Nay ! Satan talks in Milton 's tone !</l>
     <l n="29">Where'er the ocean inlet strays ,</l>
     <l n="30">The salt sea wave its source betrays ;</l>
     <l n="31">Where'er the queen of summer blows ,</l>
     <l n="32">She tells the zephyr , “ I 'm the rose ! ”</l>

     <l n="33">And his is not the playwright 's page ;</l>
     <l n="34">His table does not ape the stage ;</l>
     <l n="35">What matter if the figures seen</l>
     <l n="36">Are only shadows on a screen ,</l>
     <l n="37">He finds in them his lurking thought ,</l>
     <l n="38">And on their lips the words he sought ,</l>
     <l n="39">Like one who sits before the keys</l>
     <l n="40">And plays a tune himself to please .</l>

     <l n="41">And was he noted in his day ?</l>
     <l n="42">Read , flattered , honored ? Who shall say ?</l>
     <l n="43">Poor wreck of time the wave has cast</l>
     <l n="44">To find a peaceful shore at last ,</l>
     <l n="45">Once glorying in thy gilded name</l>

     <l n="49">For be it more or less of art</l>
     <l n="50">That veils the lowliest human heart</l>
     <l n="51">Where passion throbs , where friendship glows ,</l>
     <l n="52">Where pity 's tender tribute flows ,</l>
     <l n="53">Where love has lit its fragrant fire ,</l>
     <l n="54">And sorrow quenched its vain desire ,</l>
     <l n="55">For me the altar is divine ,</l>
     <l n="56">Its flame , its ashes ,— all are mine !</l>

     <l n="60">In shadows lengthening from the west ,</l>
     <l n="61">Thy glance that wanders , as it sought</l>
     <l n="62">Some freshly opening flower of thought ,</l>
