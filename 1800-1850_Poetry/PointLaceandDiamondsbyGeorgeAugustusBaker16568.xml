     <l n="2">I 'd wandered , for a week or more ,</l>
     <l n="3">Through hills , and dells , and doleful green'ry ,</l>
     <l n="4">Lodging at any carnal door ,</l>
     <l n="5">Sustaining life on pork , and scenery .</l>
     <l n="6">A weary scribe , I 'd just let slip</l>
     <l n="7">My collar , for a short vacation ,</l>
     <l n="8">And started on a walking trip ,</l>
     <l n="9">That cheapest form of dissipation —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">And vilest , Oh ! confess my pen ,</l>
     <l n="11">That I , prosaic , rather hate your</l>
     <l n="12">“ Ode to a Sky-lark ” sort of men ;</l>
     <l n="13">I really am not fond of Nature .</l>
     <l n="14">Mad longing for a decent meal</l>
     <l n="15">And decent clothing overcame me ;</l>
     <l n="16">There came a blister on my heel —</l>
     <l n="17">I gave it up ; and who can blame me ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="18">Then wrote my “ Pulse of Nature 's Heart , ”</l>
     <l n="19">Which I procured some little cash on ,</l>
     <l n="20">And quickly packed me to depart</l>
     <l n="21">In search of “ gilded haunts ” of fashion ,</l>
     <l n="22">Which I might puff at column rates ,</l>
     <l n="23">To please my host and meet my reckoning ;</l>
     <l n="24">“ Base is the slave who ” — hesitates</l>
     <l n="25">When wealth , and pleasure both are beckoning .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>I sought ; I found . Among the swells I had my share of small successes , Made languid love to languid belles And penn 'd descriptions of their dresses . Ah ! Millionairess Millicent , How fair you were ! How you adored me ! How many tender hours we spent — And , oh , beloved , how you bored me ! APRIL , 1871 .</p>
   <p>Is not that fragmentary bit Of my young verse a perfect prism , Where worldly knowledge , pleasant wit , True humor , kindly cynicism , Refracted by the frolic glass Of Fancy , play with change incessant ? JUNE , 1874 .</p>
   <p>Great Cæsar ! What a sweet young ass I must have been , when adolescent ! AUGUST , 1886 .</p>

     <l n="5">See her at prayer ! Her pleading hands</l>
     <l n="6">Bear not one gem of all her store .</l>
     <l n="7">Her face is saint-like . Be rebuked</l>
     <l n="8">By those pure eyes , and gaze no more</l>

     <l n="9">Turn , turn away ! But carry hence</l>
     <l n="10">The lesson she has dumbly taught —</l>

    <head>IN THE RECORD ROOM , SURROGATE 'S OFFICE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A tomb where legal ghouls grow fat ;</l>
     <l n="2">Where buried papers , fold on fold ,</l>
     <l n="3">Crumble to dust , that ‘ thwart the sun</l>
     <l n="4">Floats dim , a pallid ghost of gold .</l>
     <l n="5">The day is dying . All about ,</l>

     <l n="3">Their crimson banners wide unfold ,</l>
     <l n="4">Low-levelled lie their golden lances .</l>
     <l n="5">The shadows lurk along the shore ,</l>
     <l n="6">Where , as our row-boat lightly passes ,</l>
     <l n="7">The ripples startled by our oar ,</l>

     <l n="12">Of you the sun delays his setting .</l>
     <l n="13">One hand droops idly from the boat ,</l>
     <l n="14">And round the white and swaying fingers ,</l>
     <l n="15">Like half-blown lilies gone afloat ,</l>

     <l n="22">Who fight for bread ‘ neath Themis ’ banner</l>
     <l n="23">Should all at once begin to rave</l>

     <l n="36">Your smile more thoroughly deceive me .</l>
     <l n="37">I think it well that men , dear wife ,</l>
     <l n="38">Are sometimes with such madness smitten ,</l>
     <l n="39">Else little joy would be in life ,</l>

   <p>I . LOVE 'S YOUNG DREAM . A. D. 1880 .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Thank you — much obliged , old boy ,</l>
     <l n="2">Yes , it 's so ; report says true .</l>
     <l n="3">I 'm engaged to Nell Latine —</l>
     <l n="4">What else could a fellow do ?</l>
     <l n="5">Governor was getting fierce ;</l>
     <l n="6">Asked me , with paternal frown ,</l>
     <l n="7">When I meant to go to work ,</l>
     <l n="8">Take a wife , and settle down .</l>
     <l n="9">Stormed at my extravagance ,</l>
     <l n="10">Talked of cutting off supplies —</l>
     <l n="11">Fairly bullied me , you know —</l>
     <l n="12">Sort of thing that I despise .</l>
     <l n="13">Well , you see , I lost worst way</l>
     <l n="14">At the races — Governor raged —</l>
     <l n="15">So , to try and smooth him down ,</l>
     <l n="16">I went off , and got engaged .</l>
     <l n="17">Sort of put-up job , you know —</l>
     <l n="18">All arranged with old Latine —</l>
     <l n="19">Nellie raved about it first ,</l>
     <l n="20">Said her ‘ pa was awful mean ! ’</l>
     <l n="21">Now it 's done we do n't much mind —</l>
     <l n="22">Tell the truth , I 'm rather glad ;</l>
     <l n="23">Looking at it every way ,</l>
     <l n="24">One must own it is n't bad .</l>
     <l n="25">She 's good-looking , rather rich ,—</l>
     <l n="26">Mother left her quite a pile ;</l>
     <l n="27">Dances , goes out everywhere ;</l>
     <l n="28">Fine old family , real good style .</l>
     <l n="29">Then she 's good , as girls go now ,</l>
     <l n="30">Some idea of wrong and right ,</l>
     <l n="31">Do n't let every man she meets</l>
     <l n="32">Kiss her , on the self-same night .</l>
     <l n="33">We do n't do affection much ,</l>
     <l n="34">Nell and I are real good friends ,</l>
     <l n="35">Call there often , sit and chat ,</l>
     <l n="36">Take her ‘ round , and there it ends .</l>
     <l n="37">Spooning ! Well , I tried it once —</l>
     <l n="38">Acted like an awful calf —</l>
     <l n="39">Said I really loved her . Gad !</l>
     <l n="40">You should just have heard her laugh .</l>
     <l n="41">Why , she ran me for a month ,</l>
     <l n="42">Teased me till she made me wince ;</l>
     <l n="43">‘ Must n't flirt with her , ’ she said ,</l>
     <l n="44">So I have n't tried it since .</l>
     <l n="45">‘ Twould be pleasant to be loved</l>
     <l n="46">Like you read about in books —</l>
     <l n="47">Mingling souls , and tender eyes —</l>
     <l n="48">Love , and that , in all their looks ;</l>
     <l n="49">Thoughts of you , and no one else ;</l>
     <l n="50">Voice that has a tender ring ,</l>
     <l n="51">Sacrifices made , and — well —</l>
     <l n="52">You know — all that sort of thing .</l>
     <l n="53">That 's all worn-out talk , they say ,</l>
     <l n="54">Do n't see any of it now —</l>
     <l n="55">Spooning on your fiancée</l>
     <l n="56">Is n't good style , anyhow .</l>
     <l n="57">Just suppose that one of us ,—</l>
     <l n="58">Nell and me , you know — some day</l>
     <l n="59">Got like that on some one else —</l>
     <l n="60">Might be rather awkward — eh !</l>
     <l n="61">All in earnest , like the books —</l>
     <l n="62">Would n't it be awful rough !</l>
     <l n="63">Jove ! if I — but pshaw , what bosh !</l>
     <l n="64">Nell and I are safe enough .—</l>
     <l n="65">Some time in the Spring , I think ;</l>
     <l n="66">Be on hand to wish us joy ?</l>
     <l n="67">Be a groomsman , if you like —</l>
     <l n="68">Lots of wine — good-bye , old boy . ”</l>

     <l n="12">There , drop my trail , Jane !— is it straight ?</l>
     <l n="13">I hope I look timid , and shrinking !</l>
     <l n="14">The church must be perfectly full —</l>
     <l n="15">Good gracious , please do n't walk so fast , Pa !</l>
     <l n="16">He do n't seem to think that trains pull .</l>

     <l n="18">I do n't feel embarrassed at all —</l>
     <l n="19">But , my ! What 's the minister saying ?</l>
     <l n="20">Oh , I know , that part ‘ bout Saint Paul .</l>
     <l n="21">I hope my position is graceful —</l>
     <l n="22">How awkwardly Nelly Dane stood !</l>
     <l n="23">“ Not lawfully be joined together ,</l>
     <l n="24">Now speak ” — as if any one would .</l>
     <l n="25">Oh , dear , now it 's my turn to answer —</l>
     <l n="26">I do wish that Pa would stand still .</l>
     <l n="27">“ Serve him , love , honor , and keep him ” —</l>
     <l n="28">How sweetly he says it — I will .</l>
     <l n="29">Where 's Pa ?— there , I knew he 'd forget it</l>
     <l n="30">When the time came to give me away —</l>
     <l n="31">“ I , Helena , take thee — love — cherish —</l>
     <l n="32">And ” — well , I can n't help it ,— “ obey . ”</l>
     <l n="33">Here , Maud , take my bouquet — do n't drop it —</l>
     <l n="34">I hope Charley 's not lost the ring !</l>
     <l n="35">Just like him !— no — goodness , how heavy !</l>
     <l n="36">It 's really an elegant thing .</l>
     <l n="37">It 's a shame to kneel down in white satin —</l>
     <l n="38">And the flounce real old lace — but I must —</l>
     <l n="39">I hope that they 've got a clean cushion ,</l>
     <l n="40">They 're usually covered with dust .</l>
     <l n="41">All over — ah , thanks !— now , do n't fuss , Pa !—</l>
     <l n="42">Just throw back my veil , Charley — there !</l>
     <l n="43">Oh , bother ! Why could n't he kiss me</l>
     <l n="44">Without mussing up all my hair !</l>
     <l n="45">Your arm , Charley , there goes the organ —</l>
     <l n="46">Who 'd think there would be such a crowd !</l>
     <l n="47">Oh , I must n't look round , I 'd forgotten ,</l>
     <l n="48">See , Charley , who was it that bowed ?</l>
     <l n="49">Why — it 's Nellie Allaire , with her husband —</l>
     <l n="50">She 's awfully jealous , I know ,</l>
     <l n="51">Most all of my things were imported ,</l>
     <l n="52">And she had a home-made trousseau .</l>
     <l n="53">And there 's Annie Wheeler — Kate Hermon —</l>
     <l n="54">I did n't expect her at all —</l>
     <l n="55">If she 's not in that same old blue satin</l>
     <l n="56">She wore at the Charity Ball !</l>
     <l n="57">Is that Fanny Wade ?— Edith Pommeton —</l>
     <l n="58">And Emma , and Jo — all the girls !</l>
     <l n="59">I knew they 'd not miss my wedding —</l>
     <l n="60">I hope they 'll all notice my pearls .</l>
     <l n="61">Is the carriage there ?— give me my cloak , Jane ,</l>
     <l n="62">Do n't get it all over my veil —</l>
     <l n="63">No ! you take the other seat , Charley —</l>
     <l n="64">I need all of this for my trail .</l>

     <l n="74">To run off with another man 's wife .</l>
     <l n="75">At his age , you know — barely thirty —</l>
     <l n="76">So romantic , and makes such a noise</l>
     <l n="77">In one 's club — why , one can n't but excuse him ,</l>
     <l n="78">Now can one , dear ? Boys will be boys .</l>
     <l n="79">I 've known him so long — why , he 'd come here</l>
     <l n="80">And talk to me just like a son .</l>
     <l n="81">It 's my duty — I feel as a mother —</l>
     <l n="82">To save him ; the thing can be done</l>
     <l n="83">Very easily . First , I must show him</l>
     <l n="84">How grossly the woman deceived</l>
     <l n="85">And entrapped him .— It made such a scandal</l>
     <l n="86">You know , that he can n't be received</l>
     <l n="87">At all , any more , till he drops her —</l>
     <l n="88">He 'll certainly not be so mad</l>
     <l n="89">As to hold to her still . Oh , I know him</l>
     <l n="90">So well — I 'm quite sure he 'll be glad</l>
     <l n="91">On any excuse , to oblige me</l>
     <l n="92">In a matter so trifling indeed .</l>
     <l n="93">Then the way will be clear . We 'll receive him ,</l>
     <l n="94">And the rest will soon follow our lead .</l>
     <l n="95">We must keep our eyes on him more closely</l>
     <l n="96">Hereafter ; young men of his wealth</l>
     <l n="97">And position are so sorely tempted</l>
     <l n="98">To waste time , and fortune , and health</l>
     <l n="99">In frivolous pleasures and pastimes ,</l>
     <l n="100">That there 's but one safe-guard in life</l>
     <l n="101">For them and their money — we 've seen it —</l>
     <l n="102">A really nice girl for a wife .</l>
     <l n="103">Too bad you 've no daughter ! My Mamie</l>
     <l n="104">Had influence with him for good</l>
     <l n="105">Before this affair — when he comes here</l>
     <l n="106">She 'll meet him , I 'm sure , as she should —</l>
     <l n="107">That is , as if nothing had happened —</l>
     <l n="108">And greet him with sisterly joy ;</l>
     <l n="109">Between us I know we can save him .</l>
     <l n="110">I 'll write him to-morrow , poor boy . ”</l>

    <head>A LEGEND OF ST. VALENTINE .</head>
     <l n="1">Come ! Why , halloa , that you , Jack ?</l>
     <l n="2">How 's the world been using you ?</l>
     <l n="3">Want your pipe ? it 's in the jar —</l>
     <l n="4">Think I might be looking blue .</l>
     <l n="5">Maud 's been breaking off with me ,</l>
     <l n="6">Fact — see here — I 've got the ring .</l>
     <l n="7">That 's the note she sent it in ;</l>
     <l n="8">Read it — soothing sort of thing .</l>
     <l n="9">Jack , you know I write sometimes —</l>
     <l n="10">Must have read some things of mine .</l>
     <l n="11">Well , I thought I 'd just send Maud</l>
     <l n="12">Something for a valentine .</l>
     <l n="13">So I ground some verses out</l>
     <l n="14">In the softest kind of style ,</l>
     <l n="15">Full of love , and that , you know —</l>
     <l n="16">Bothered me an awful while ;</l>
     <l n="17">Quite a heavy piece of work .</l>
     <l n="18">So when I had got them done —</l>
     <l n="19">Why , I thought them much too good</l>
     <l n="20">Just to waste that way on one .</l>
     <l n="21">Jack , I told you , did n't I ,</l>
     <l n="22">All about that black-eyed girl</l>
     <l n="23">Up in Stratford — last July —</l>
     <l n="24">Oh ! you know ; you saw her curl ?</l>
     <l n="25">Well , old fellow , she 's the one</l>
     <l n="26">That this row is all about ,</l>
     <l n="27">For I sent her — who 'd have thought</l>
     <l n="28">Maud would ever find it out —</l>
     <l n="29">Those same verses , word for word —</l>
     <l n="30">Hang it , man ! you need n't roar —</l>
     <l n="31">“ Splendid joke ! ” well , so I thought —</l>
     <l n="32">No , do n't think so any more .</l>
     <l n="33">Yesterday , you know it rained ,</l>
     <l n="34">I 'd been up late — at a ball —</l>
     <l n="35">Did n't know what else to do —</l>
     <l n="36">Went up and made Maud a call ,</l>
     <l n="37">Found some other girl there , too ,</l>
     <l n="38">They were playing a duet .</l>
     <l n="39">“ Fred , my cousin , Nelly Deane , ” —</l>
     <l n="40">Yes , Jack , there was my brunette ;</l>
     <l n="41">You should just have seen me , Jack —</l>
     <l n="42">Now , old fellow , please do n't laugh ,</l>
     <l n="43">I feel bad about it — fact —</l>
     <l n="44">And I really can n't stand chaff .</l>
     <l n="45">Well , I tried to talk to Maud ,</l>
     <l n="46">There was Nell , though , sitting by ;</l>
     <l n="47">Every now and then she 'd laugh ,</l>
     <l n="48">Sure I can n't imagine why .</l>
     <l n="49">Maud would read that beastly poem ,</l>
     <l n="50">Nell 's eyes said in just one glance ,</l>
     <l n="51">“ Wont I make you pay for this ,</l>
     <l n="52">If I ever get the chance ! ”</l>
     <l n="53">Some one came and rang the bell ,</l>
     <l n="54">Just a note for Nell , by post .</l>
     <l n="55">Jack , I saw my monogram —</l>
     <l n="56">I 'd have rather seen a ghost .</l>
     <l n="57">Yes — her verses — I suppose</l>
     <l n="58">That her folks had sent them down —</l>
     <l n="59">Could n't get up there , you know —</l>
     <l n="60">Till she 'd left and come to town .</l>
     <l n="61">Nelly looked them quickly through —</l>
     <l n="62">Laughed — by Jove , I thought she 'd choke .</l>
     <l n="63">“ Maud — he 'll kill me — dear ! oh , dear !—</l>
     <l n="64">Read that ; is n't it a joke ? ”</l>
     <l n="65">Maud glanced through them — sank right down</l>
     <l n="66">On the sofa — hid her face —</l>
     <l n="67">“ Crying ! ” — not much — laughing , Jack —</l>
     <l n="68">Do n't think she 's a hopeless case .</l>
     <l n="69">I just grabbed my hat and left —</l>
     <l n="70">Only wish I 'd gone before .</l>
     <l n="71">How they laughed !— I heard them , Jack —</l>
     <l n="72">Till I got outside the door .</l>
     <l n="73">There , confession 's done me good ,</l>
     <l n="74">I can never win her back ,</l>
     <l n="75">So I 'll calmly let her slide —</l>
     <l n="76">Pass the ash-cup , will you , Jack .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">We were driving home from the “ Patriarchs ’ ” —</l>
     <l n="2">Molly Lefévre and I , you know ;</l>
     <l n="3">The white flakes fluttered about our lamps ;</l>
     <l n="4">Our wheels were hushed in the sleeping snow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Her white arms nestled amid her furs ;</l>
     <l n="6">Her hands half-held , with languid grace ,</l>
     <l n="7">Her fading roses ; fair to see</l>
     <l n="8">Was the dreamy look in her sweet , young face .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">I watched her , saying never a word ,</l>
     <l n="10">For I would not waken those dreaming eyes .</l>
     <l n="11">The breath of the roses filled the air ,</l>
     <l n="12">And my thoughts were many , and far from wise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">At last I said to her , bending near ,</l>
     <l n="14">“ Ah , Molly Lefévre , how sweet ‘ twould be ,</l>
     <l n="15">To ride on dreaming , all our lives ,</l>
     <l n="16">Alone with the roses — you and me . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Her sweet lips faltered , her sweet eyes fell ,</l>
     <l n="18">And , low as the voice of a Summer rill ,</l>
     <l n="19">Her answer came . It was — “ Yes , perhaps —</l>
     <l n="20">But who would settle our carriage bill ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">The dying roses breathed their last ,</l>
     <l n="22">Our wheels rolled loud on the stones just then ,</l>
     <l n="23">Where the snow had drifted ; the subject dropped .</l>
     <l n="24">It has never been taken up again .</l>

     <l n="1">Spring-time is coming again , my dear ;</l>
     <l n="2">Sunshine and violets blue , you know ;</l>
     <l n="3">Crocuses lifting their sleepy heads</l>
     <l n="4">Out of their sheets of snow .</l>
     <l n="5">And I know a blossom sweeter by far</l>
     <l n="6">That violets blue , or crocuses are ,</l>
     <l n="7">And bright as the sunbeam 's glow .</l>
     <l n="8">But how can I dare to look in her eyes ,</l>
     <l n="9">Colored with heaven 's own hue ?</l>
     <l n="10">That would n't do at all , my dear ,</l>
     <l n="11">It really would n't do .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="12">Her hair is a rippling , tossing sea ;</l>
     <l n="13">In its golden depths the fairies play ,</l>
     <l n="14">Beckoning , dancing , mocking there ,</l>
     <l n="15">Luring my heart away .</l>
     <l n="16">And her merry lips are the ripest red</l>
     <l n="17">That ever addled a poor man 's head ,</l>
     <l n="18">Or led his wits astray .</l>
     <l n="19">What would n't I give to taste the sweets</l>
     <l n="20">Of those rose-leaves wet with dew !</l>
     <l n="21">But that would n't do at all , my dear ,</l>
     <l n="22">It really would n't do .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="23">Her voice is gentle , and clear and pure ;</l>
     <l n="24">It rings like the chime of a silver bell ,</l>
     <l n="25">And the thought it wakes in my foolish head ,</l>
     <l n="26">I 'm really afraid to tell .</l>
     <l n="27">Her little feet kiss the ground below ,</l>
     <l n="28">And her hand is white as the whitest snow</l>
     <l n="29">That e'er from heaven fell .</l>
     <l n="30">But I would n't dare to take that hand ,</l>
     <l n="31">Reward for my love to sue ;</l>
     <l n="32">That would n't do at all , my dear ,</l>
