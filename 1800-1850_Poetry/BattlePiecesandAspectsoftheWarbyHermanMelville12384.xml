  <body>
   <p>The Battle-Pieces in this volume are dedicated to the memory of the THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND who in the war for the maintenance of the Union fell devotedly under the flag of their fathers .</p>
   <p>[ With few exceptions , the Pieces in this volume originated in an impulse imparted by the fall of Richmond . They were composed without reference to collective arrangement , but being brought together in review , naturally fall into the order assumed .</p>
   <p>The events and incidents of the conflict — making up a whole , in varied amplitude , corresponding with the geographical area covered by the war — from these but a few themes have been taken , such as for any cause chanced to imprint themselves upon the mind .</p>
   <p>The aspects which the strife as a memory assumes are as manifold as are the moods of involuntary meditation — moods variable , and at times widely at variance . Yielding instinctively , one after another , to feelings not inspired from any one source exclusively , and unmindful , without purposing to be , of consistency , I seem , in most of these verses , to have but placed a harp in a window , and noted the contrasted airs which wayward wilds have played upon the strings . ]</p>

On Wednesday this good work was done ; But of the doers some lie prone . Each wood , each hill , each glen was fought for ; The bold inclosing line we wrought for Flamed with sharpshooters . Each cliff cost A limb or life . But back we forced Reserves and all ; made good our hold ; And so we rest .</p>

   <p>FURTHER . A yelling rout Of ragamuffins broke profuse To-day from out the Fort . Sole uniform they wore , a sort Of patch , or white badge ( as you choose ) Upon the arm . But leading these , Or mingling , were men of face And bearing of patrician race , Splendid in courage and gold lace — The officers . Before the breeze Made by their charge , down went our line ; But , rallying , charged back in force , And broke the sally ; yet with loss . This on the left ; upon the right Meanwhile there was an answering fight ; Assailants and assailed reversed . The charge too upward , and not down — Up a steep ridge-side , toward its crown , A strong redoubt . But they who first Gained the fort 's base , and marked the trees Felled , heaped in horned perplexities , And shagged with brush ; and swarming there Fierce wasps whose sting was present death — They faltered , drawing bated breath , And felt it was in vain to dare ; Yet still , perforce , returned the ball , Firing into the tangled wall Till ordered to come down . They came ; But left some comrades in their fame , Red on the ridge in icy wreath And hanging gardens of cold Death . But not quite unavenged these fell ; Our ranks once out of range , a blast Of shrapnel and quick shell Burst on the rebel horde , still massed , Scattering them pell-mell . ( This fighting — judging what we read — Both charge and countercharge , Would seem but Thursday 's told at large , Before in brief reported .— Ed . ) Night closed in about the Den Murky and lowering . Ere long , chill rains . A night not soon to be forgot , Reviving old rheumatic pains And longings for a cot .</p>

   <p>LATER . Great suffering through the night — A stinging one . Our heedless boys Were nipped like blossoms . Some dozen Hapless wounded men were frozen . During day being struck down out of sight , And help-cries drowned in roaring noise , They were left just where the skirmish shifted — Left in dense underbrush now-drifted . Some , seeking to crawl in crippled plight , So stiffened — perished . Yet in spite Of pangs for these , no heart is lost . Hungry , and clothing stiff with frost , Our men declare a nearing sun Shall see the fall of Donelson . And this they say , yet not disown The dark redoubts round Donelson , And ice-glazed corpses , each a stone — A sacrifice to Donelson ; They swear it , and swerve not , gazing on A flag , deemed black , flying from Donelson . Some of the wounded in the wood Were cared for by the foe last night , Though he could do them little needed good , Himself being all in shivering plight . The rebel is wrong , but human yet ; He 's got a heart , and thrusts a bayonet . He gives us battle with wondrous will — The bluff 's a perverted Bunker Hill .</p>

   <p>1 . The gloomy lull of the early part of the winter of 1860-1 , seeming big with final disaster to our institutions , affected some minds that believed them to constitute one of the great hopes of mankind , much as the eclipse which came over the promise of the first French Revolution affected kindred natures , throwing them for the time into doubt and misgivings universal .</p>

   <p>All accounts seem to agree that the object proposed was not accomplished . The channel is even said to have become ultimately benefited by the means employed to obstruct it .</p>
   <p>3 . The Temeraire , that storied ship of the old English fleet , and the subject of the well-known painting by Turner , commends itself to the mind seeking for some one craft to stand for the poetic ideal of those great historic wooden warships , whose gradual displacement is lamented by none more than by regularly educated navy officers , and of all nations .</p>
   <p>4 . Some of the cannon of old times , especially the brass ones , unlike the more effective ordnance of the present day , were cast in shapes which Cellini might have designed , were gracefully enchased , generally with the arms of the country . A few of them — field-pieces — captured in our earlier wars , are preserved in arsenals and navy-yards .</p>
   <p>5 . Whatever just military criticism , favorable or otherwise , has at any time been made upon General McClellan 's campaigns , will stand . But if , during the excitement of the conflict , aught was spread abroad tending the unmerited disparagement of the man , it must necessarily die out , though not perhaps without leaving some traces , which may or may not prove enduring . Some there are whose votes aided in the re-election of Abraham Lincoln , who yet believed , and retain the belief , that General McClellan , to say the least , always proved himself a patriotic and honorable soldier . The feeling which surviving comrades entertain for their late commnder is one which , from its passion , is susceptible of versified representation , and such it receives .</p>
   <p>6 . At Antietam Stonewall Jackson led one wing of Lee 's army , consequenty sharing that day in whatever may be deemed to have been the fortunes of his superior .</p>
   <p>7 . Admiral Porter is son of the late Commodore Porter , commander of the Frigate Essex on that Pacific cruise which ended in the desparate fight off Valparaiso with the English frigates Cherub and Phoebe , in the year 1814 .</p>
   <p>8 . Among numerous head-stones or monuments on Cemetery Hill , marred or destroyed by the enemy 's concentrated fire , was one , somewhat conspicuous , of a Federal officer killed before Richmond in 1862 .</p>
   <p>On the 4th of July 1865 , the Gettysburg National Cemetery , on the same height with the original burial-ground , was consecrated , and the corner-stone laid of a commemorative pile .</p>
   <p>9 . “ I dare not write the horrible and inconceivable atrocities committed , ” says Froissart , in alluding to the remarkable sedition in France during his time . The like may be hinted of some proceedings of the draft-rioters .</p>
   <p>10 . Although the month was November , the day was in character an October one — cool , clear , bright , intoxicatingly invigorating ; one of those days peculiar to the ripest hours of our American Autumn . This weather must have had much to do with the spontaneous enthusiasm which seized the troops — and enthusiasm aided , doubtless , by glad thoughts of the victory of Look-out Mountain won the day previous , and also by the elation attending the capture , after a fierce struggle , of the long ranges of rifle-pits at the mountain 's base , where orders for the time should have stopped the advance . But there and then it was that the army took the bit between its teeth , and ran away with the generals to the victory commemorated . General Grant , at Culpepper , a few weeks prior to crossing the Rapidan for the Wilderness , expressed to a visitor his impression of the impulse and the spectacle : Said he : “ I never saw any thing like it : ” language which seems curiously undertoned , considering its application ; but from the taciturn Commander it was equivalent to a superlative or hyperbole from the talkative .</p>
   <p>The height of the Ridge , according to the account at hand , varies along its length from six to seven hundred feet above the plain ; it slopes at an angle of about forty-five degrees .</p>
   <p>11 . The great Parrott gun , planted in the marshes of James Island , and employed in the prolonged , though at times intermitted bombardment of Charleston , was known among our soldiers as the Swamp Angel .</p>
   <p>St. Michael 's , characterized by its venerable tower , was the historic and aristrocratic church of the town .</p>
   <p>12 . Among the Northwestern regiments there would seem to have been more than one which carried a living eagle as an added ensign . The bird commemorated here was , according the the account , borne aloft on a perch beside the standard ; went through successive battles and campaigns ; was more than once under the surgeon 's hands ; and at the close of the contest found honorable repose in the capital of Wisconsin , from which state he had gone to the wars .</p>
   <p>13 . The late Major General McPherson , commanding the Army of the Tennessee , a major of Ohio and a West Pointer , was one of the foremost spirits of the war . Young , though a veteran ; hardy , intrepid , sensitive in honor , full of engaging qualities , with manly beauty ; possessed of genius , a favorite with the army , and with Grant and Sherman . Both Generals have generously acknowledged their professional obligiations to the able engineer and admirable soldier , their subordinate and junior .</p>
   <p>In an informal account written by the Achilles to this Sarpedon , he says : “ On that day we avenged his death . Near twenty-two hundred of the enemy 's dead remained on the ground when night closed upon the scene of action . ”</p>
   <p>It is significant of the scale on which the war was waged , that the engagement thus written of goes solely ( so far as can be learned ) under the vague designation of one of the battles before Atlanta .</p>
   <p>14 . The piece was written while yet the reports were coming North of Sherman 's homeward advance from Savannah . It is needless to point out its purely dramatic character .</p>
   <p>Though the sentiment ascribed in the beginning of the second stanza must , in the present reading , suggest the historic tragedy of the 14th of April , nevertheless , as intimated , it was written prior to that event , and without any distinct application in the writer 's mind . After consideration , it is allowed to remain .</p>
   <p>Few need be reminded that , by the less intelligent classes of the South , Abraham Lincoln , by nature the most kindly of men , was regarded as a monster wantonly warring upon liberty . He stood for the personification of tyrannic power . Each Union soldier was called a Lincolnite .</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly Sherman , in the desolation he inflicted after leaving Atlanta , acted not in contravention of orders ; and all , in a military point of view , if by military judged deemed to have been expedient , and nothing can abate General Sherman 's shining renown ; his claims to it rest on no single campaign . Still , there are those who can not but contrast some of the scenes enacted in Georgia and the Carolinas , and also in the Shenandoah , with a circumstance in a great Civil War of heathen antiquity . Plutarch relates that in a military council held by Pompey and the chiefs of that party which stood for the Commonwealth , it was decided that under no plea should any city be sacked that was subject to the people of Rome . There was this difference , however , between the Roman civil conflict and the American one . The war of Pompey and Caesar divided the Roman people promiscuously ; that of the North and South ran a frontier line between what for the time were distinct communities or nations . In this circumstance , possibly , and some others , may be found both the cause and the justification of some of the sweeping measures adopted .</p>
   <p>15 . At this period of excitement the thought was by some passionately welcomed that the Presidential successor had been raised up by heaven to wreak vengeance on the South . The idea originated in the remembrance that Andrew Johnson by birth belonged to that class of Southern whites who never cherished love for the dominant : that he was a citizen of Tennessee , where the contest at times and in places had been close and bitter as a Middle-Age feud ; the himself and family had been hardly treated by the Secessionists .</p>
   <p>But the expectations build hereon ( if , indeed , ever soberly entertained ) , happily for the country , have not been verified .</p>
   <p>Likely the feeling which would have held the entire South chargeable with the crime of one exceptional assassin , this too has died away with the natural excitement of the hour .</p>
   <p>16 . The incident on which this piece is based is narrated in a newspaper account of the battle to be found in the “ Rebellion Record . ” During the disaster to the national forces on the first day , a brigade on the extreme left found itself isolated . The perils it encountered are given in detail . Among others , the following sentences occur :</p>
   <p>“ Under cover of the fire from the bluffs , the rebels rushed down , crossed the ford , and in a moment were seen forming this side the creek in open fields , and within close musket-range . Their color-bearers stepped defiantly to the front as the engagement opened furiously ; the rebels pouring in sharp , quick volleys of musketry , and their batteries above continuing to support them with a destructive fire . Our sharpshooters wanted to pick off the audacious rebel color-bearers , but Colonel Stuart interposed : ‘ No , no , they 're too brave fellows to be killed . ’ ”</p>
   <p>17 . According to a report of the Secretary of War , there were on the first day of March , 1865 , 965 , 000 men on the army pay-rolls . Of these , some 200 , 000 — artillery , cavalry , and infantry — made up from the larger portion of the veterans of Grant and Sherman , marched by the President . The total number of Union troops enlisted during the war was 2 , 668 , 000 .</p>
   <p>18 . For a month or two after the completion of peace , some thousands of released captives from the military prisons of the North , natives of all parts of the South , passed through the city of New York , sometimes waiting farther transportation for days , during which interval they wandered penniless about the streets , or lay in their worn and patched gray uniforms under the trees of Battery , near the barracks where they were lodged and fed . They were transported and provided for at the charge of government .</p>
   <p>19 . Shortly prior to the evacuation of Petersburg , the enemy , with a view to ultimate repossession , interred some of his heavy guns in the same field with his dead , and with every circumstance calculated to deceive . Subsequently the negroes exposed exposed the stratagem .</p>
   <p>20 . The records of Northern colleges attest what numbers of our noblest youth went from them to the battle-field . Southern members of the same classes arrayed themselves on the side of Secession ; while Southern seminaries contributed large quotas . Of all these , what numbers marched who never returned except on the shield .</p>
   <p>21 . Written prior to the founding of the National Cemetery at Andersonville , where 15 , 000 of the reinterred captives now sleep , each beneath his personal head-board , inscribed from records found in the prison-hospital . Some hundreds rest apart and without name . A glance at the published pamphlet containing the list of the buried at Andersonville conveys a feeling mournfully impressive . Seventy-four large double-columned page in fine print . Looking through them is like getting lost among the old turbaned head-stones and cypresses in the interminable Black Forest of Scutari , over against Constantinople .</p>
   <p>22 . In one of Kilpatrick 's earlier cavalry fights near Aldie , a Colonel who , being under arrest , had been temporarily deprived of his sword , nevertheless , unarmed , insisted upon charging at the head of his men , which he did , and the onset proved victorious .</p>
   <p>23 . Certain of Mosby 's followers , on the charge of being unlicensed foragers or fighters , being hung by order of a Union cavalry commander , the Partisan promptly retaliated in the woods . In turn , this also was retaliated , it is said . To what extent such deplorable proceedings were carried , it is not easy to learn .</p>
   <p>South of the Potamac in Virginia , and within a gallop of the Long Bridge at Washington , is the confine of a country , in some places wild , which throughout the war it was unsafe for a Union man to traverse except with an armed escort . This was the chase of Mosby , the scene of many of his exploits or those of his men . In the heart of this region at least one fortified camp was maintained by our cavalry , and from time to time expeditions ended disastrously . Such results were helped by the exceeding cunning of the enemy , born of his wood-craft , and , in some instances , by undue confidence on the part of our men . A body of cavalry , starting from camp with the view of breaking up a nest of rangers , and absent say three days , would return with a number of their own forces killed and wounded ( ambushed ) , without being able to retaliate farther than by foraging on the country , destroying a house or two reported to be haunts of the guerrillas , or capturing non-combatants accused of being secretly active in their behalf .</p>
   <p>In the verse the name of Mosby is invested with some of those associations with which the popular mind is familiar . But facts do not warrant the belief that every clandestine attack of men who passed for Mosby 's was made under his eye or even by his knowledge .</p>
   <p>In partisan warfare he proved himself shrewd , able , and enterprising , and always a wary fighter . He stood well in the confidence of his superior officers , and was empoyed by them at times in furtherance of important movements . To our wounded on more than one occasion he showed considerate kindness . Officers and civilians captured by forces under his immediate command were , so long as remaining under his orders , treated with civility . These things are well known to those personally familiar with the irregular fighting in Virginia .</p>
   <p>24 . Among those summoned during the spring just passed to appear before the Reconstruction Committee of Congress was Robert E. Lee . His testimony is deeply interesting , both in itself and as coming from him . After various questions had been put and briefly answered , these words were addressed to him :</p>
   <p>“ If there be any other matter about which you wish to speak on this occasions , do so freely . ” Waiving this invitation , he responded by a short personal explanation of some point in a previous answer , and after a few more brief questions and replies , the interview closed .</p>
   <p>In the verse a poetical liberty has been ventured . Lee is not only represented as responding to the invitation , but also as at last renouncing his cold reserve , doubtless the cloak to feelings more or less poignant . If for such freedom warrant be necessary the speeches in ancient histories , not to speak of those in Shakespeare 's historic plays , may not unfitly perhaps be cited .</p>

   <p>Were I fastidiously anxious for the symmetry of this book , it would close with the notes . But the times are such that patriotism — not free from solicitude — urges a claim overriding all literary scruples .</p>
   <p>It is more than a year since the memorable surrender , but events have not yet rounded themselves into completion . Not justly can we complain of this . There has been an upheavel affecting the basis of things ; to altered circumstances complicated adaptations are to be made ; there are difficulties great and novel . But is Reason still waiting for Passion to spend itself ? We have sung of the soldiers and sailors , but who shall hymn the politicians ?</p>
   <p>In view of the infinite desirableness of Re-establishment , and considering that , so far as feeling is concerned , it depends not mainly on the temper in which the South regards the North , but rather conversely ; one who never was a blind adherent feels constrained to submit some thoughts , counting on the indulgence of his countrymen .</p>
   <p>And , first , it may be said that , if among the feelings and opinions growing immediately out of a great civil convulsion , there are any which time shall modify or do away , they are presumably those of a less temperate and charitable cast .</p>
   <p>There seems no reason why patriotism and narrowness should go together , or why intellectual impartiality should be confounded with political trimming , or why serviceable truth should keep cloistered be a cause not partisan . Yet the work of Reconstruction , if admitted to be feasible at all , demands little but common sense and Christian charity . Little but these ? These are much .</p>
   <p>Some of us are concerned because as yet the South shows no penitence . But what exactly do we mean by this ? Since down to the close of the war she never confessed any for braving it , the only penitence now left her is that which springs solely from the sense of discomfiture ; and since this evidently would be a contrition hypocritical , it would be unworthy in us to demand it . Certain it is that penitence , in the sense of voluntary humiliation , will never be displayed . Nor does this afford just ground for unreserved condemnation . It is enough , for all practical purposes , if the South have been taught by the terrors of civil war to feel that Secession , like Slavery , is against Destiny ; that both now lie buried in one grave ; that her fate is linked with ours ; and that together we comprise the Nation .</p>
   <p>The clouds of heroes who battled for the Union it is needless to eulogize here . But how of the soldiers on the other side ? And when of a free community we name the soldiers , we thereby name the people . It was in subserviency to the slave-interest that Secession was plotted ; but it was under the plea , plausibly urged , that certain inestimable rights guaranteed by the Constitution were directly menaced , that the people of the South were cajoled into revolution . Through the arts of the conspirators and the perversity of fortune , the most sensitive love of liberty was entrapped into the support of a war whose implied end was the erecting in our advanced century of an Anglo-American empire based upon the systematic degradation of man .</p>
   <p>Spite this clinging reproach , however , signal military virtues and achievements have conferred upon the Confederate arms historic fame , and upon certain of the commanders a renown extending beyond the sea — a renown which we of the North could not suppress even if we would . In personal character , also , not a few of the military leaders of the South enforce forbearance ; the memory of others the North refrains from disparaging ; and some , with more or less of reluctance , she can respect . Posterity , sympathizing with our convictions , but removed from our passions , may perhaps go farther here . If George IV . could out of the graceful instinct of a gentleman , raise an honorable monument in the great fane of Christendom over the remains of the enemy of his dynasty , Charles Edward , the invader of England and victor in the rout at Preston Pans — Upon whose head the king 's ancestor but one reign removed has set a price — is it probable that the grandchildren of General Grant will pursue with rancor , or slur by sour neglect , the memory of Stonewall Jackson ?</p>
   <p>But the South herself is not wanting in recent histories and biographies which record the deeds of her chieftains — writings freely published at the North by loyal houses , widely read here , and with a deep though saddened interest . By students of the war such works are hailed as welcome accessories , and tending to the completeness of the record .</p>
   <p>Supposing a happy issue out of present perplexities , then , in the generation next to come , Southerners there will be yielding allegiance to the Union , feeling all their interests bound up in it , and yet cherishing unrebuked that kind of feeling for the memory of the soldiers of the fallen Confederacy that Burns , Scott , and the Ettrick Shepherd felt for the memory of the gallant clansmen ruined through their fidelity to the Stuarts — a feeling whose passion was tempered by the poetry imbuing it , and which in no wise affected their loyalty to the Georges , and which , it may be added , indirectly contributed excellent things to literature . But , setting this view aside , dishonorable would it be in the South were she willing to abandon to shame the memory of brave men who with signal personal disinterestedness warred in her behalf , though from motives , as we believe , so deplorably astray .</p>
   <p>Patriotism is not baseness , neither is it inhumanity . The mourners who this summer bear flowers to the mounds of the Virginian and Georgian dead are , in their domestic bereavement and proud affection , as sacred in the eye of Heaven as are those who go with similar offerings of tender grief and love into the cemeteries of our Northern martyrs . And yet , in one aspect , how needless to point the contrast .</p>
   <p>Cherishing such sentiments , it will hardly occasion surprise that , in looking over the battle-pieces in the foregoing collection , I have been tempted to withdraw or modify some of them , fearful lest in presenting , though but dramatically and by way of a poetic record , the passions and epithets of civil war , I might be contributing to a bitterness which every sensible American must wish at an end . So , too , with the emotion of victory as reproduced on some pages , and particularly toward the close . It should not be construed into an exultation misapplied — an exultation as ungenerous as unwise , and made to minister , however indirectly , to that kind of censoriousness too apt to be produced in certain natures by success after trying reverses . Zeal is not of necessity religion , neither is it always of the same essence with poetry or patriotism .</p>
   <p>There were excesses which marked the conflict , most of which are perhaps inseparable from a civil strife so intense and prolonged , and involving warfare in some border countries new and imperfectly civilized . Barbarities also there were , for which the Southern people collectively can hardly be held responsible , though perpetrated by ruffians in their name . But surely other qualities — exalted ones — courage and fortitude matchless , were likewise displayed , and largely ; and justly may these be held the characteristic traits , and not the former .</p>
   <p>In this view , what Northern writer , however patriotic , but must revolt from acting on paper a part any way akin to that of the live dog to the dead lion ; and yet it is right to rejoice for our triumph , so far as it may justly imply an advance for our whole country and for humanity .</p>
   <p>Let it be held no reproach to any one that he pleads for reasonable consideration for our late enemies , now stricken down and unavoidably debarred , for the time , from speaking through authorized agencies for themselves . Nothing has been urged here in the foolish hope of conciliating those men — few in number , we trust — who have resolved never to be reconciled to the Union . On such hearts every thing is thrown away except it be religious commiseration , and the sincerest . Yet let them call to mind that unhappy Secessionist , not a military man , who with impious alacrity fired the first shot of the Civil War at Sumter , and a little more than four years afterward fired the last one into his own heart at Richmond .</p>
   <p>Noble was the gesture into which patriotic passion surprised the people in a utilitarian time and country ; yet the glory of the war falls short of its pathos — a pathos which now at last ought to disarm all animosity .</p>
   <p>How many and earnest thoughts still rise , and how hard to repress them . We feel what past years have been , and years , unretarded years , shall come . May we all have moderation ; may we all show candor . Though , perhaps , nothing could ultimately have averted the strife , and though to treat of human actions is to deal wholly with second causes , nevertheless , let us not cover up or try to extenuate what , humanly speaking , is the truth — namely , that those unfraternal denunciations , continued through years , and which at last inflamed to deeds that ended in bloodshed , were reciprocal ; and that , had the preponderating strength and the prospect of its unlimited increase lain on the other side , on ours might have lain those actions which now in our late opponents we stigmatize under the name of Rebellion . As frankly let us own — what it would be unbecoming to parade were foreigners concerned — that our triumph was won not more by skill and bravery than by superior resources and crushing numbers ; that it was a triumph , too , over a people for years politically misled by designing men , and also by some honestly-erring men , who from their position could not have been otherwise than broadly influential ; a people who , though indeed , they sought to perpetuate the curse of slavery , and even extend it , were not the authors of it , but ( less fortunate , not less righteous than we ) were the fated inheritors ; a people who , having a like origin with ourselves , share essentially in whatever worthy qualities we may possess . No one can add to the lasting reproach which hopeless defeat has now cast upon Secession by withholding the recognition of these verities .</p>
   <p>Surely we ought to take it to heart that that kind of pacification , based upon principles operating equally all over the land , which lovers of their country yearn for , and which our arms , though signally triumphant , did not bring about , and which law-making , however anxious , or energetic , or repressive , never by itself can achieve , may yet be largely aided by generosity of sentiment public and private . Some revisionary legislation and adaptive is indispensable ; but with this should harmoniously work another kind of prudence not unallied with entire magnanimity . Benevolence and policy — Christianity and Machiavelli — dissuade from penal severities toward the subdued . Abstinence here is as obligatory as considerate care for our unfortunate fellow-men late in bonds , and , if observed , would equally prove to be wise forecast . The great qualities of the South , those attested in the War , we can perilously alienate , or we may make them nationally available at need .</p>
   <p>The blacks , in their infant pupilage to freedom , appeal to the sympathies of every humane mind . The paternal guardianship which for the interval government exercises over them was prompted equally by duty and benevolence . Yet such kindliness should not be allowed to exclude kindliness to communities who stand nearer to us in nature . For the future of the freed slaves we may well be concerned ; but the future of the whole country , involving the future of the blacks , urges a paramount claim upon our anxiety . Effective benignity , like the Nile , is not narrow in its bounty , and true policy is always broad . To be sure , it is vain to seek to glide , with moulded words , over the difficulties of the situation . And for them who are neither partisans , nor enthusiasts , nor theorists , nor cynics , there are some doubts not readily to be solved . And there are fears . Why is not the cessation of war now at length attended with the settled calm of peace ? Wherefore in a clear sky do we still turn our eyes toward the South , as the Neapolitan , months after the eruption , turns his toward Vesuvius ? Do we dread lest the repose may be deceptive ? In the recent convulsion has the crater but shifted ? Let us revere that sacred uncertainty which forever impends over men and nations . Those of us who always abhorred slavery as an atheistical iniquity , gladly we join in the exulting chorus of humanity over its downfall . But we should remember that emancipation was accomplished not by deliberate legislation ; only through agonized violence could so mighty a result be effected . In our natural solicitude to confirm the benefit of liberty to the blacks , let us forbear from measures of dubious constitutional rightfulness toward our white countrymen — measures of a nature to provoke , among other of the last evils , exterminating hatred of race toward race . In imagination let us place ourselves in the unprecedented position of the Southerners — their position as regards the millions of ignorant manumitted slaves in their midst , for whom some of us now claim the suffrage . Let us be Christians toward our fellow-whites , as well as philanthropists toward the blacks our fellow-men . In all things , and toward all , we are enjoined to do as we would be done by . Nor should we forget that benevolent desires , after passing a certain point , can not undertake their own fulfillment without incurring the risk of evils beyond those sought to be remedied . Something may well be left to the graduated care of future legislation , and to heaven . In one point of view the co-existence of the two races in the South — whether the negro be bond or free — seems ( even as it did to Abraham Lincoln ) a grave evil . Emancipation has ridded the country of the reproach , but not wholly of the calamity . Especially in the present transition period for both races in the South , more or less of trouble may not unreasonably be anticipated ; but let us not hereafter be too swift to charge the blame exclusively in any one quarter . With certain evils men must be more or less patient . Our institutions have a potent digestion , and may in time convert and assimilate to good all elements thrown in , however originally alien .</p>
   <p>But , so far as immediate measures looking toward permanent Re-establishment are concerned , no consideration should tempt us to pervert the national victory into oppression for the vanquished . Should plausible promise of eventual good , or a deceptive or spurious sense of duty , lead us to essay this , count we must on serious consequences , not the least of which would be divisions among the Northern adherents of the Union . Assuredly , if any honest Catos there be who thus far have gone with us , no longer will they do so , but oppose us , and as resolutely as hitherto they have supported . But this path of thought leads toward those waters of bitterness from which one can only turn aside and be silent .</p>
   <p>But supposing Re-establishment so far advanced that the Southern seats in Congress are occupied , and by men qualified in accordance with those cardinal principles of representative government which hitherto have prevailed in the land — what then ? Why the Congressman elected by the people of the South will — represent the people of the South . This may seem a flat conclusion ; but in view of the last five years , may there not be latent significance in it ? What will be the temper of those Southern members ? and , confronted by them , what will be the mood of our own representatives ? In private life true reconciliation seldom follows a violent quarrel ; but if subsequent intercourse be unavoidable , nice observances and mutual are indispensable to the prevention of a new rupture . Amity itelf can only be maintained by reciprocal respect , and true friends are punctilious equals . On the floor of Congress North and South are to come together after a passionate duel , in which the South though proving her valor , has been made to bite the dust . Upon differences in debate shall acrimonious recriminations be exchanged ? shall censorious superiority assumed by one section provoke defiant self-assertion on the other ? shall Manassas and Chickamauga be retorted for Chattanooga and Richmond ? Under the supposition that the full Congress will be composed of gentlemen , all this is impossible . Yet if otherwise , it needs no prophet of Israel to foretell the end . The maintenance of Congressional decency in the future will rest mainly with the North . Rightly will more forbearance be required from the North than the South , for the North is victor .</p>
   <p>But some there are who may deem these latter thoughts inapplicable , and for this reason : Since the test-oath opertively excludes from Congress all who in any way participated in Secession , therefore none but Southerners wholly in harmony with the North are eligible to seats . This is true for the time being . But the oath is alterable ; and in the wonted fluctuations of parties not improbably it will undergo alteration , assuming such a form , perhaps , as not to bar the admission into the National Legislature of men who represent the populations lately in revolt . Such a result would involve no violation of the principles of democratic government . Not readily can one perceive how the political existence of the millions of late Secessionists can permanently be ignored by this Republic . The years of the war tried our devotion to the Union ; the time of peace may test the sincerity of our faith in democracy .</p>
   <p>In no spirit of opposition , not by way of challenge , is any thing here thrown out . These thoughts are sincere ones ; they seem natural — inevitable . Here and there they must have suggested themselves to many thoughtful patriots . And , if they be just thoughts , ere long they must have that weight with the public which already they have had with individuals .</p>
   <p>For that heroic band — those children of the furnace who , in regions like Texas and Tennessee , maintained their fidelity through terrible trials — we of the North felt for them , and profoundly we honor them . Yet passionate sympathy , with resentments so close as to be almost domestic in their bitterness , would hardly in the present juncture tend to discreet legislation . Were the Unionists and Secessionists but as Guelphs and Ghibellines ? If not , then far be it from a great nation now to act in the spirit that animated a triumphant town-faction in the Middle Ages . But crowding thoughts must at last be checked ; and , in times like the present , one who desires to be impartially just in the expression of his views , moves as among sword-points presented on every side .</p>
   <p>Let us pray that the terrible historic tragedy of our time may not have been enacted without instructing our whole beloved country through terror and pity ; and may fulfillment verify in the end those expectations which kindle the bards of Progress and Humanity .</p>
