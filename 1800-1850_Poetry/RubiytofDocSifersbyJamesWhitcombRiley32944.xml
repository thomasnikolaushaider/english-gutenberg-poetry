   <p>THE LOYAL CHUM OF MY LATEST YOUTH AND LIKE FRIEND AND COMRADE STILL WITH ALL GRATEFUL AFFECTION OF</p>
   <p>THE AUTHOR .</p>
   <p>We found him in that Far-away that yet to us seems near — We vagrants of but yesterday when idlest youth was here ,— When lightest song and laziest mirth possessed us through and through , And all the dreamy summer-earth seemed drugged with morning dew :</p>
   <p>When our ambition scarce had shot a stalk or blade indeed : Yours ,— choked as in the garden-spot you still deferred to “ weed ": Mine ,— but a pipe half-cleared of pith — as now it flats and whines In sympathetic cadence with a hiccough in the lines .</p>
   <p>Aye , even then — O timely hour !— the High Gods did confer In our behalf :— And , clothed in power , lo , came their Courier — Not winged with flame nor shod with wind ,— but ambling down the pike , Horseback , with saddlebags behind , and guise all human-like .</p>
   <p>And it was given us to see , beneath his rustic rind , A native force and mastery of such inspiring kind , That half unconsciously we made obeisance .— Smiling , thus His soul shone from his eyes and laid its glory over us .</p>
   <p>Though , faring still that Far-away that yet to us seems near , His form , through mists of yesterday , fades from the vision here , Forever as he rides , it is in retinue divine ,— The hearts of all his time are his , with your hale heart and mine .</p>

   <p>RUBAIYAT OF DOC SIFERS</p>
   <p>I</p>
   <p>Ef you do n't know DOC SIFERS I 'll jes argy , here and now , You 've bin a mighty little while about here , anyhow ! ‘ Cause Doc he 's rid these roads and woods — er swum ‘ em , now and then — And practised in this neighberhood sence hai n't no tellin ’ when !</p>
    <p>II</p>
   <p>In radius o ’ fifteen mile 'd , all p'ints o ’ compass round , No man er woman , chick er child , er team , on top o ’ ground , But knows him — yes , and got respects and likin ’ fer him , too , Fer all his so-to-speak dee-fects o ’ genius showin ’ through !</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>III</head>
    <head>Some claims he 's absent-minded ; some has said they wuz afeard To take his powders when he come and dosed ‘ em out , and ‘ peared To have his mind on somepin ’ else — like County Ditch , er some New way o ’ tannin ’ mussrat-pelts , er makin ’ butter come .</head>

   <p>IV</p>
   <p>He 's cur'ous — they hai n't no mistake about it !— but he 's got Enough o ’ extry brains to make a jury — like as not . They 's no describin ’ Sifers ,— fer , when all is said and done , He 's jes hisse'f Doc Sifers — ner they hai n't no other one !</p>
   <p>V</p>
   <p>Doc 's allus sociable , polite , and ‘ greeable , you 'll find — Pervidin ’ ef you strike him right and nothin ’ on his mind ,— Like in some hurry , when they 've sent fer Sifers quick , you see , To ‘ tend some sawmill-accident , er picnic jamboree ;</p>
    <p>VI</p>
   <p>Er when the lightnin ’ ‘ s struck some hare - brained harvest-hand ; er in Some ‘ tempt o ’ suicidin ’ — where they 'd ort to try ag'in ! I 've knowed Doc haul up from a trot and talk a ’ hour er two When railly he 'd a-ort o ’ not a-stopped fer “ Howdy-do ! ”</p>

   <p>And then , I 've met him ‘ long the road , a-lopin ’ ,— starin ’ straight Ahead ,— and yit he never knowed me when I hollered “ Yate , Old Saddlebags ! ” all hearty-like , er “ Who you goin ’ to kill ? ” And he 'd say nothin ’ — only hike on faster , starin ’ still !</p>
    <p>VIII</p>
   <p>I 'd bin insulted , many a time , ef I jes wuz n't shore Doc did n't mean a thing . And I 'm not tetchy any more Sence that-air day , ef he 'd a-jes a-stopped to jaw with me , They 'd bin a little dorter less in my own fambily !</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>IX</head>
    <head>Times now , at home , when Sifers ’ name comes up , I jes let on , You know , ‘ at I think Doc 's to blame , the way he 's bin and gone And disapp'inted folks — ‘ Ll-jee-mun-nee ! you 'd ort to then Jes hear my wife light into me — “ ongratefulest o ’ men ! ”</head>

   <p>‘ Mongst all the women — mild er rough , splendifferous er plain , Er them with sense , er not enough to come in out the rain ,— Jes ever ’ shape and build and style o ’ women , fat er slim — They all like Doc , and got a smile and pleasant word fer him !</p>
   <p>XI</p>
   <p>Ner hai n't no horse I 've ever saw but what 'll neigh and try To sidle up to him , and paw , and sense him , ear-and-eye : Then jes a tetch o ’ Doc 's old pa 'm , to pat ‘ em , er to shove Along their nose — and they 're as ca 'm as any cooin ’ dove !</p>
    <p>XII</p>
   <p>And same with dogs ,— take any breed , er strain , er pedigree , Er racial caste ‘ at can n't concede no use fer you er me ,— They 'll putt all predju-dice aside in Doc 's case and go in Kahoots with him , as satisfied as he wuz kith-and-kin !</p>
   <lg type="poem">

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">And Doc 's a wonder , trainin ’ pets !—</l>
     <l n="2">He 's got a chicken-hawk ,</l>
     <l n="3">In kind o ’ half-cage , where he sets</l>
     <l n="4">out in the gyarden-walk ,</l>
     <l n="5">And got that wild bird trained so tame ,</l>
     <l n="6">he 'll loose him , and he 'll fly</l>
     <l n="7">Clean to the woods !— Doc calls his name —</l>
     <l n="8">and he 'll come , by-and-by !</l>

   <p>XIV</p>
   <p>Some says no money down ud buy that bird o ’ Doc .— Ner no Inducement to the bird , says I , ‘ at he 'd let Sifers go ! And Doc he say ‘ at he 's content — long as a bird o ’ prey Kin ‘ bide him , it 's a compliment , and takes it thataway .</p>
   <p>XV</p>
   <p>But , gittin ’ back to docterin ’ — all the sick and in distress , And old and pore , and weak and small , and lone and motherless ,— I jes tell you I ‘ preciate the man ‘ at ‘ s got the love To “ go ye forth and ministrate ! ” as Scriptur ’ tells us of .</p>
    <p>XVI</p>
   <p>Dull times , Doc jes mianders round , in that old rig o ’ his : And hai n't no tellin ’ where he 's bound ner guessin ’ where he is ; He 'll drive , they tell , jes thataway fer maybe six er eight Days at a stretch ; and neighbers say he 's bin clean round the State .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>XVII</head>
    <head>He picked a ’ old tramp up , one trip , ‘ bout eighty mile 'd from here , And fetched him home and k-yored his hip , and kep ’ him ‘ bout a year ; And feller said — in all his ja'nts round this terreschul ball ‘ At no man wuz a circumstance to Doc !— he topped ‘ em all !—</head>
     <l n="1">[ Illustration ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>XVIII</p>
   <p>Said , bark o ’ trees ‘ s a ’ open book to Doc , and vines and moss He read like writin ’ — with a look knowed ever ’ dot and cross : Said , stars at night wuz jes as good ‘ s a compass : said , he s'pose You could n't lose Doc in the woods the darkest night that blows !</p>
   <p>XIX</p>
   <p>Said , Doc 'll tell you , purty clos't , by underbresh and plants , How fur off warter is ,— and ‘ most perdict the sort o ’ chance You 'll have o ’ findin ’ fish ; and how they 're liable to bite , And whether they 're a-bitin ’ now , er only after night .</p>
    <p>XX</p>
   <p>And , whilse we 're talkin ’ fish ,— I mind they formed a fishin ’ - crowd ( When folks could fish ‘ thout gittin ’ fined , and seinin ’ wuz allowed ! ) O ’ leadin ’ citizens , you know , to go and seine “ Old Blue ” — But had n't no big seine , and so — w'y , what wuz they to do ?...</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>XXI</head>
    <head>And Doc he say he thought ‘ at he could knit a stitch er two — “ Bring the materials to me — ‘ at 's all I 'm astin ’ you ! ” And down he sets — six weeks , i jing ! and knits that seine plum done — Made corks too , brails and ever'thing — good as a boughten one !</head>
     <l n="1">[ Illustration ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>XXII</p>
   <p>Doc 's public sperit — when the sick ‘ s not takin ’ all his time And he 's got some fer politics — is simple yit sublime :— He 'll talk his principles — and they air honest ;— but the sly Friend strikes him first , election-day , he 'd ‘ commodate , er die !</p>
   <p>XXIII</p>
   <p>And yit , though Doc , as all men knows , is square straight up and down , That vote o ’ his is — well , I s'pose — the cheapest one in town ;— A fact ‘ at 's sad to verify , as could be done on oath — I 've voted Doc myse'f — And I was criminal fer both !</p>
    <p>XXIV</p>
   <p>You kin corrupt the ballot-box — corrupt yourse'f , as well — Corrupt some neighbers ,— but old Doc 's as oncorruptible As Holy Writ . So putt a pin right there !— Let Sifers be , I jucks ! he would n't vote agin his own worst inimy !</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>XXV</head>
    <head>When Cynthy Eubanks laid so low with fever , and Doc Glenn Told Euby Cynth ‘ ud haf to go — they sends fer Sifers then !... Doc sized the case : “ She 's starved , ” says he , “ fer warter — yes , and meat ! The treatment ‘ at she 'll git from me ‘ s all she kin drink and eat ! ”</head>
     <l n="1">[ Illustration ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>XXVI</p>
   <p>He orders Euby then to split some wood , and take and build A fire in kitchen-stove , and git a young spring-chicken killed ; And jes whirled in and th'owed his hat and coat there on the bed , And warshed his hands and sailed in that - air kitchen , Euby said ,</p>
   <p>XXVII</p>
   <p>And biled that chicken-broth , and got that dinner — all complete And clean and crisp and good and hot as mortal ever eat ! And Cynth and Euby both 'll say ‘ at Doc 'll git as good Meals-vittles up , jes any day , as any woman could !</p>
    <p>XXVIII</p>
   <p>Time Sister Abbick tuk so bad with striffen o ’ the lung , P'tracted Meetin ’ , where she had jes shouted , prayed and sung All winter long , through snow and thaw ,— when Sifers come , says he : “ No , M'lissy ; do n't poke out your raw and cloven tongue at me !—</p>

   <p>And yit he 'd be the last man out to flop his wings and crow Insultin ’ - like , and strut about above his fallen foe !— No-sir ! the hand ‘ at tuk the wind out o ’ their sails ‘ ud be The very first they grabbed , and grinned to feel sich sympathy .</p>
