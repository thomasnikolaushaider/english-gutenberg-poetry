   <p>DEDICATION .</p>
   <p>TO MY FATHER .</p>
   <p>I dedicate to you a work , which is submitted to the public with a diffidence and hesitation proportioned to the novelty of the effort it represents . For in this poem I have abandoned those forms of verse with which I had most familiarized my thoughts , and have endeavored to follow a path on which I could discover no footprints before me , either to guide or to warn .</p>
   <p>There is a moment of profound discouragement which succeeds to prolonged effort ; when , the labor which has become a habit having ceased , we miss the sustaining sense of its companionship , and stand , with a feeling of strangeness and embarrassment , before the abrupt and naked result . As regards myself , in the present instance , the force of all such sensations is increased by the circumstances to which I have referred . And in this moment of discouragement and doubt , my heart instinctively turns to you , from whom it has so often sought , from whom it has never failed to receive , support .</p>
   <p>I do not inscribe to you this book because it contains anything that is worthy of the beloved and honored name with which I thus seek to associate it ; nor yet because I would avail myself of a vulgar pretext to display in public an affection that is best honored by the silence which it renders sacred .</p>
   <p>Feelings only such as those with which , in days when there existed for me no critic less gentle than yourself , I brought to you my childish manuscripts ; feelings only such as those which have , in later years , associated with your heart all that has moved or occupied my own ,— lead me once more to seek assurance from the grasp of that hand which has hitherto been my guide and comfort through the life I owe to you .</p>
   <p>And as in childhood , when existence had no toil beyond the day 's simple lesson , no ambition beyond the neighboring approval of the night , I brought to you the morning 's task for the evening 's sanction , so now I bring to you this self-appointed taskwork of maturer years ; less confident indeed of your approval , but not less confident of your love ; and anxious only to realize your presence between myself and the public , and to mingle with those severer voices to whose final sentence I submit my work the beloved and gracious accents of your own .</p>

    <head>LETTER FROM THE COMTESSE DE NEVERS TO LORD ALFRED VARGRAVE .</head>
    <head>“ I hear from Bigorre you are there . I am told You are going to marry Miss Darcy . Of old , So long since you may have forgotten it now ( When we parted as friends , soon mere strangers to grow ) , Your last words recorded a pledge — what you will — A promise — the time is now come to fulfil . The letters I ask you , my lord , to return , I desire to receive from your hand . You discern My reasons , which , therefore , I need not explain . The distance to Luchon is short . I remain A month in these mountains . Miss Darcy , perchance , Will forego one brief page from the summer romance Of her courtship , and spare you one day from your place At her feet , in the light of her fair English face . I desire nothing more , and trust you will feel I desire nothing much . “ Your friend always , “ LUCILE . ”</head>

      <l n="1">Now in May Fair , of course ,— in the fair month of May —</l>
      <l n="2">When life is abundant , and busy , and gay :</l>
      <l n="3">When the markets of London are noisy about</l>
      <l n="4">Young ladies , and strawberries ,— “ only just out ; ”</l>
      <l n="5">Fresh strawberries sold under all the house-eaves ,</l>
      <l n="6">And young ladies on sale for the strawberry-leaves :</l>
      <l n="7">When cards , invitations , and three-cornered notes</l>
      <l n="8">Fly about like white butterflies — gay little motes</l>
      <l n="9">In the sunbeam of Fashion ; and even Blue Books</l>
      <l n="10">Take a heavy-wing 'd flight , and grow busy as rooks ;</l>
      <l n="11">And the postman ( that Genius , indifferent and stern ,</l>
      <l n="12">Who shakes out even-handed to all , from his urn ,</l>
      <l n="13">Those lots which so often decide if our day</l>
      <l n="14">Shall be fretful and anxious , or joyous and gay )</l>
      <l n="15">Brings , each morning , more letters of one sort or other</l>
      <l n="16">Than Cadmus , himself , put together , to bother</l>
      <l n="17">The heads of Hellenes ;— I say , in the season</l>
      <l n="18">Of Fair May , in May Fair , there can be no reason</l>
      <l n="19">Why , when quietly munching your dry toast and butter ,</l>
      <l n="20">Your nerves should be suddenly thrown in a flutter</l>
      <l n="21">At the sight of a neat little letter , address 'd</l>
      <l n="22">In a woman 's handwriting , containing , half guess 'd ,</l>
      <l n="23">An odor of violets faint as the Spring ,</l>
      <l n="24">And coquettishly seal 'd with a small signet-ring .</l>
      <l n="25">But in Autumn , the season of sombre reflection ,</l>
      <l n="26">When a damp day , at breakfast , begins with dejection ;</l>
      <l n="27">Far from London and Paris , and ill at one 's ease ,</l>
      <l n="28">Away in the heart of the blue Pyrenees ,</l>
      <l n="29">Where a call from the doctor , a stroll to the bath ,</l>
      <l n="30">A ride through the hills on a hack like a lath ,</l>
      <l n="31">A cigar , a French novel , a tedious flirtation ,</l>
      <l n="32">Are all a man finds for his day 's occupation ,</l>
      <l n="33">The whole case , believe me , is totally changed ,</l>
      <l n="34">And a letter may alter the plans we arranged</l>
      <l n="35">Over-night , for the slaughter of time — a wild beast ,</l>
      <l n="36">Which , though classified yet by no naturalist ,</l>
      <l n="37">Abounds in these mountains , more hard to ensnare ,</l>
      <l n="38">And more mischievous , too , than the Lynx or the Bear .</l>

    <head>THE COMTESSE DE NEVERS TO LORD ALFRED VARGRAVE :</head>
    <head>“ No , Alfred ! If over the present , when last We two met , rose the glamour and mist of the past , It hath now rolled away , and our two paths are plain , And those two paths divide us . “ That hand which again Mine one moment has clasp 'd as the hand of a brother , That hand and your honor are pledged to another ! Forgive , Alfred Vargrave , forgive me , if yet For that moment ( now past ! ) I have made you forget What was due to yourself and that other one . Yes , Mine the fault , and be mine the repentance . Not less , In now owning this fault , Alfred , let me own , too , I foresaw not the sorrow involved in it . “ True , That meeting , which hath been so fatal , I sought , I alone ! But oh ! deem not it was with the thought Of your heart to regain , or the past to rewaken . No ! believe me , it was with the firm and unshaken Conviction , at least , that our meeting would be Without peril to YOU , although haply to me The salvation of all my existence . “ I own , When the rumor first reach 'd me , which lightly made known To the world your engagement , my heart and my mind Suffer 'd torture intense . It was cruel to find That so much of the life of my life , half unknown To myself , had been silently settled on one Upon whom but to think it would soon be a crime . Then I said to myself , ‘ From the thraldom which time Hath not weaken 'd there rests but one hope of escape . That image which Fancy seems ever to shape From the solitude left round the ruins of yore , Is a phantom . The Being I loved is no more . What I hear in the silence , and see in the lone Void of life , is the young hero born of my own Perish 'd youth : and his image , serene and sublime In my heart rests unconscious of change and of time , Could I see it but once more , as time and as change Have made it , a thing unfamiliar and strange , See , indeed , that the Being I loved in my youth Is no more , and what rests now is only , in truth , The hard pupil of life and the world : then , oh , then , I should wake from a dream , and my life be again Reconciled to the world ; and , released from regret , Take the lot fate accords to my choice . ’ “ So we met . But the danger I did not foresee has occurr 'd : The danger , alas , to yourself ! I have err 'd . But happy for both that this error hath been Discover 'd as soon as the danger was seen ! We meet , Alfred Vargrave , no more . I , indeed , Shall be far from Luchon when this letter you read . My course is decided ; my path I discern : Doubt is over ; my future is fix 'd now . “ Return , O return to the young living love ! Whence , alas ! If , one moment , you wander 'd , think only it was More deeply to bury the past love . “ And , oh ! Believe , Alfred Vargrave , that I , where I go On my far distant pathway through life , shall rejoice To treasure in memory all that your voice Has avow 'd to me , all in which others have clothed To my fancy with beauty and worth your betrothed ! In the fair morning light , in the orient dew Of that young life , now yours , can you fail to renew All the noble and pure aspirations , the truth , The freshness , the faith , of your own earnest youth ? Yes ! YOU will be happy . I , too , in the bliss I foresee for you , I shall be happy . And this Proves me worthy your friendship . And so — let it prove That I cannot — I do not respond to your love . Yes , indeed ! be convinced that I could not ( no , no , Never , never ! ) have render 'd you happy . And so , Rest assured that , if false to the vows you have plighted , You would have endured , when the first brief , excited Emotion was o'er , not alone the remorse Of honor , but also ( to render it worse ) Disappointed affection . “ Yes , Alfred ; you start ? But think ! if the world was too much in your heart , And too little in mine , when we parted ten years Ere this last fatal meeting , that time ( ay , and tears ! ) Have but deepen 'd the old demarcations which then Placed our natures asunder ; and we two again , As we then were , would still have been strangely at strife . In that self-independence which is to my life Its necessity now , as it once was its pride , Had our course through the world been henceforth side by side , I should have revolted forever , and shock 'd Your respect for the world 's plausibilities , mock 'd , Without meaning to do so , and outraged , all those Social creeds which you live by . “ Oh ! do not suppose That I blame you . Perhaps it is you that are right . Best , then , all as it is ! “ Deem these words life 's Good-night To the hope of a moment : no more ! If there fell Any tear on this page , ‘ twas a friend 's . “ So farewell To the past — and to you , Alfred Vargrave . “ LUCILE . ”</head>

      <l n="190">And the Powers of the night through the vast solitudes</l>
      <l n="191">Walk 'd abroad and conversed with each other . The trees</l>
      <l n="192">Were in sound and in motion , and mutter 'd like seas</l>
      <l n="193">In Elfland . The road through the forest was hollow 'd .</l>
      <l n="194">On he sped through the darkness , as though he were follow 'd</l>

      <l n="204">Craggy promontory , o'er a fissure as grim ,</l>
      <l n="205">Through which , ever roaring , there leap 'd o'er the limb</l>
      <l n="206">Of the rent rock a torrent of water , from sight ,</l>
      <l n="207">Into pools that were feeding the roots of the night .</l>
      <l n="208">A balcony hung o'er the water . Above</l>
      <l n="209">In a glimmering casement a shade seem 'd to move .</l>
      <l n="210">At the door the old negress was nodding her head</l>
      <l n="211">As he reach 'd it . “ My mistress awaits you , ” she said .</l>
      <l n="212">And up the rude stairway of creeking pine rafter</l>

     <l n="41">Were those elements in him , which once roused to strife</l>
     <l n="42">Overthrow a whole nature , and change a whole life ?</l>
     <l n="43">There are two kinds of strength . One , the strength of the river</l>

     <l n="46">This , the aim of its life , it is lost to its use ,</l>
     <l n="47">It goes mad , is diffused into deluge , and dies .</l>
     <l n="48">The other , the strength of the sea ; which supplies</l>
     <l n="49">Its deep life from mysterious sources , and draws</l>
     <l n="50">The river 's life into its own life , by laws</l>
     <l n="51">Which it heeds not . The difference in each case is this :</l>
     <l n="52">The river is lost , if the ocean it miss ;</l>
     <l n="53">If the sea miss the river , what matter ? The sea</l>
     <l n="54">Is the sea still , forever . Its deep heart will be</l>
     <l n="55">Self-sufficing , unconscious of loss as of yore ;</l>
     <l n="56">Its sources are infinite ; still to the shore ,</l>
     <l n="57">With no diminution of pride , it will say ,</l>
     <l n="58">“ I am here ; I , the sea ! stand aside , and make way ! ”</l>

      <l n="181">O'er the howling abysses of nothingness ! There</l>

      <l n="185">The voices abroad o'er those vast solitudes ,</l>

      <l n="200">The clouds</l>
      <l n="201">Had heap 'd themselves over the bare west in crowds</l>
      <l n="202">Of misshapen , incongruous potents . A green</l>
      <l n="203">Streak of dreary , cold , luminous ether , between</l>
      <l n="204">The base of their black barricades , and the ridge</l>
      <l n="205">Of the grim world , gleam 'd ghastly , as under some bridge ,</l>
      <l n="206">Cyclop-sized , in a city of ruins o'erthrown</l>
      <l n="207">By sieges forgotten , some river , unknown</l>
      <l n="208">And unnamed , widens on into desolate lands .</l>
      <l n="209">While he gazed , that cloud-city invisible hands</l>
      <l n="210">Dismantled and rent ; and reveal 'd , through a loop</l>
      <l n="211">In the breach 'd dark , the blemish 'd and half-broken hoop</l>
      <l n="212">Of the moon , which soon silently sank ; and anon</l>

      <l n="214">The wide night , discomforted , conscious of loss ,</l>
      <l n="215">Darken 'd round him . One object alone — that gray cross —</l>
      <l n="216">Glimmer 'd faint on the dark . Gazing up , he descried ,</l>
      <l n="217">Through the void air , its desolate arms outstretch 'd , wide ,</l>
      <l n="218">As though to embrace him .</l>

     <l n="1">Full familiar to him was the name that he saw ,</l>
     <l n="2">For ‘ twas that of his own future uncle-in-law .</l>
     <l n="3">Mrs. Darcy 's rich brother , the banker , well known</l>
     <l n="4">As wearing the longest philacteried gown</l>
     <l n="5">Of all the rich Pharisees England can boast of ,</l>
     <l n="6">A shrewd Puritan Scot , whose sharp wits made the most of</l>
     <l n="7">This world and the next ; having largely invested</l>
     <l n="8">Not only where treasure is never molested</l>
     <l n="9">By thieves , moth , or rust ; but on this earthly ball</l>
     <l n="10">Where interest was high , and security small .</l>
     <l n="11">Of mankind there was never a theory yet</l>
     <l n="12">Not by some individual instance upset :</l>
     <l n="13">And so to that sorrowful verse of the Psalm</l>
     <l n="14">Which declares that the wicked expand like the palm</l>
     <l n="15">In a world where the righteous are stunted and pent ,</l>
     <l n="16">A cheering exception did Ridley present .</l>
     <l n="17">Like the worthy of Uz , Heaven prosper 'd his piety .</l>
     <l n="18">The leader of every religious society ,</l>
     <l n="19">Christian knowledge he labor 'd t though life to promote</l>
     <l n="20">With personal profit , and knew how to quote</l>

      <l n="23">Whilst over this card Alfred vacantly brooded ,</l>
      <l n="24">A waiter his head through the doorway protruded ;</l>
      <l n="25">“ Sir Ridley MacNab with Milord wish 'd to speak . ”</l>
      <l n="26">Alfred Vargrave could feel there were tears on his cheek ;</l>
      <l n="27">He brushed them away with a gesture of pride .</l>
      <l n="28">He glanced at the glass ; when his own face he eyed ,</l>
      <l n="29">He was scared by its pallor . Inclining his head ,</l>
      <l n="30">He with tones calm , unshaken , and silvery , said ,</l>
      <l n="31">“ Sir Ridley may enter . ”</l>
      <l n="32">In three minutes more</l>
      <l n="33">That benign apparition appeared at the door .</l>
      <l n="34">Sir Ridley , released for a while from the cares</l>
      <l n="35">Of business , and minded to breathe the pure airs</l>
      <l n="36">Of the blue Pyrenees , and enjoy his release ,</l>
      <l n="37">In company there with his sister and niece ,</l>
      <l n="38">Found himself now at Luchon — distributing tracts ,</l>
      <l n="39">Sowing seed by the way , and collecting new facts</l>
      <l n="40">For Exeter Hall ; he was starting that night</l>
      <l n="41">For Bigorre : he had heard , to his cordial delight ,</l>
      <l n="42">That Lord Alfred was there , and , himself , setting out</l>
      <l n="43">For the same destination : impatient , no doubt !</l>
      <l n="44">Here some commonplace compliments as to “ the marriage</l>
      <l n="45">Through his speech trickled softly , like honey : his carriage</l>
      <l n="46">Was ready . A storm seem 'd to threaten the weather ;</l>
      <l n="47">If his young friend agreed , why not travel together ?</l>
      <l n="48">With a footstep uncertain and restless , a frown</l>
      <l n="49">Of perplexity , during this speech , up and down</l>
      <l n="50">Alfred Vargrave was striding ; but , after a pause</l>
      <l n="51">And a slight hesitation , the which seem 'd to cause</l>
      <l n="52">Some surprise to Sir Ridley , he answer 'd — “ My dear</l>
      <l n="53">Sir Ridley , allow me a few moments here —</l>
      <l n="54">Half an hour at the most — to conclude an affair</l>
      <l n="55">Of a nature so urgent as hardly to spare</l>
      <l n="56">My presence ( which brought me , indeed , to this spot ) ,</l>
      <l n="57">Before I accept your kind offer . ”</l>
      <l n="58">“ Why not ? ”</l>
      <l n="59">Said Sir Ridley , and smiled . Alfred Vargrave , before</l>
      <l n="60">Sir Ridley observed it , had pass 'd through the door .</l>
      <l n="61">A few moments later , with footsteps revealing</l>
      <l n="62">Intense agitation of uncontroll 'd feeling ,</l>
      <l n="63">He was rapidly pacing the garden below .</l>
      <l n="64">What pass 'd through his mind then is more than I know .</l>
      <l n="65">But before one half-hour into darkness had fled ,</l>
      <l n="66">In the courtyard he stood with Sir Ridley . His tread</l>
      <l n="67">Was firm and composed . Not a sign on his face</l>
      <l n="68">Betrayed there the least agitation . “ The place</l>
      <l n="69">You so kindly have offer 'd , ” he said , “ I accept . ”</l>
      <l n="70">And he stretch 'd out his hand . The two travellers stepp 'd</l>
      <l n="71">Smiling into the carriage .</l>
      <l n="72">And thus , out of sight ,</l>
      <l n="73">They drove down the dark road , and into the night .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="74">Sir Ridley was one of those wise men who , so far</l>
      <l n="75">As their power of saying it goes , say with Zophar ,</l>
      <l n="76">“ We , no doubt , are the people , and wisdom shall die with us ! ”</l>
      <l n="77">Though of wisdom like theirs there is no small supply with us .</l>
      <l n="78">Side by side in the carriage ensconced , the two men</l>
      <l n="79">Began to converse somewhat drowsily , when</l>
      <l n="80">Alfred suddenly thought — “ Here 's a man of ripe age ,</l>
      <l n="81">At my side , by his fellows reputed as sage ,</l>
      <l n="82">Who looks happy , and therefore who must have been wise ;</l>
      <l n="83">Suppose I with caution reveal to his eyes</l>
      <l n="84">Some few of the reasons which make me believe</l>
      <l n="85">That I neither am happy nor wise ? ‘ twould relieve</l>
      <l n="86">And enlighten , perchance , my own darkness and doubt . ”</l>
      <l n="87">For which purpose a feeler he softly put out .</l>
      <l n="88">It was snapp 'd up at once .</l>
      <l n="89">“ What is truth ? “ jesting Pilate</l>
      <l n="90">Ask 'd , and pass 'd from the question at once with a smile at</l>
      <l n="91">Its utter futility . Had he address 'd it</l>
      <l n="92">To Ridley MacNab , he at least had confess 'd it</l>
      <l n="93">Admitted discussion ! and certainly no man</l>
      <l n="94">Could more promptly have answer 'd the sceptical Roman</l>
      <l n="95">Than Ridley . Hear some street astronomer talk !</l>
      <l n="96">Grant him two or three hearers , a morsel of chalk ,</l>
      <l n="97">And forthwith on the pavement he 'll sketch you the scheme</l>
      <l n="98">Of the heavens . Then hear him enlarge on his theme !</l>
      <l n="99">Not afraid of La Place , nor of Arago , he !</l>
      <l n="100">He 'll prove you the whole plan in plain A B C .</l>
      <l n="101">Here 's your sun — call him A ; B 's the moon ; it is clear</l>
      <l n="102">How the rest of the alphabet brings up the rear</l>
      <l n="103">Of the planets . Now ask Arago , ask La Place ,</l>
      <l n="104">( Your sages , who speak with the heavens face to face ! )</l>
      <l n="105">Their science in plain A B C to accord</l>
      <l n="106">To your point-blank inquiry , my friends ! not a word</l>
      <l n="107">Will you get for your pains from their sad lips . Alas !</l>
      <l n="108">Not a drop from the bottle that 's quite full will pass .</l>
      <l n="109">‘ Tis the half-empty vessel that freest emits</l>
      <l n="110">The water that 's in it . ‘ Tis thus with men 's wits ;</l>
      <l n="111">Or at least with their knowledge . A man 's capability</l>
      <l n="112">Of imparting to others a truth with facility</l>
      <l n="113">Is proportion 'd forever with painful exactness</l>
      <l n="114">To the portable nature , the vulgar compactness ,</l>
      <l n="115">The minuteness in size , or the lightness in weight ,</l>
      <l n="116">Of the truth he imparts . So small coins circulate</l>
      <l n="117">More freely than large ones . A beggar asks alms ,</l>
      <l n="118">And we fling him a sixpence , nor feel any qualms ;</l>
      <l n="119">But if every street charity shook an investment ,</l>
      <l n="120">Or each beggar to clothe we must strip off a vestment ,</l>
      <l n="121">The length of the process would limit the act ;</l>
      <l n="122">And therefore the truth that 's summ 'd up in a tract</l>
      <l n="123">Is most lightly dispensed .</l>
      <l n="124">As for Alfred , indeed ,</l>
      <l n="125">On what spoonfuls of truth he was suffer 'd to feed</l>
      <l n="126">By Sir Ridley , I know not . This only I know ,</l>
      <l n="127">That the two men thus talking continued to go</l>
      <l n="128">Onward somehow , together — on into the night —</l>
      <l n="129">The midnight — in which they escape from our sight .</l>

   <p>“ At Coblentz a bridge of boats crosses the Rhine ; And from thence the road , winding by Ehrenbreitstein , Passes over the frontier of Nassua . ( “ N. B . No custom-house here since the Zollverein . ” See Murray , paragraph 30 . ) “ The route , at each turn , Here the lover of nature allows to discern , In varying prospect , a rich wooded dale : The vine and acacia-tree mostly prevail In the foliage observable here : and , moreover , The soil is carbonic . The road , under cover Of the grape-clad and mountainous upland that hems Round this beautiful spot , brings the traveller to — “ EMS . A Schnellpost from Frankfort arrives every day . At the Kurhaus ( the old Ducal mansion ) you pay Eight florins for lodgings . A Restaurateur Is attach 'd to the place ; but most travellers prefer ( Including , indeed , many persons of note ) To dine at the usual-priced table d'hote . Through the town runs the Lahn , the steep green banks of which Two rows of white picturesque houses enrich ; And between the high road and the river is laid Out a sort of a garden , call 'd ‘ THE Promenade . ’ Female visitors here , who may make up their mind To ascend to the top of these mountains , will find On the banks of the stream , saddled all the day long , Troops of donkeys — sure-footed — proverbially strong ; ” And the traveller at Ems may remark , as he passes , Here , as elsewhere , the women run after the asses .</p>

     <l n="3">Pursued to the place from dissimilar paths</l>
     <l n="4">By a similar sickness , there came to the Baths</l>

     <l n="24">Born too late or too early .</l>
     <l n="25">The lady , in truth ,</l>

     <l n="28">Never yet did the sun touch to ripples of gold</l>

     <l n="32">And into the mirror the bloom and the blush</l>
     <l n="33">Of her beauty broke , glowing ; like light in a gush</l>
     <l n="34">From the sunrise in summer .</l>
     <l n="35">Love , roaming , shall meet</l>

     <l n="38">Or lovelier lengths of more radiant hair —</l>
     <l n="39">Than thine , Lady Alfred ! And here I aver</l>

     <l n="48">Lord Alfred miss 'd something he sought for : indeed ,</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>COUSIN JOHN TO COUSIN ALFRED .</head>
    <head>LONDON , 18 —</head>
    <head>“ My dear Alfred , Your last letters put me in pain . This contempt of existence , this listless disdain Of your own life ,— its joys and its duties ,— the deuce Take my wits if they find for it half an excuse ! I wish that some Frenchman would shoot off your leg , And compel you to stump through the world on a peg . I wish that you had , like myself ( more 's the pity ! ) , To sit seven hours on this cursed committee . I wish that you knew , sir , how salt is the bread Of another — ( what is it that Dante has said ? ) And the trouble of other men 's stairs . In a word , I wish fate had some real affliction conferr 'd On your whimsical self , that , at least , you had cause For neglecting life 's duties , and damning its laws ! This pressure against all the purpose of life , This self-ebullition , and ferment , and strife , Betoken 'd , I grant that it may be in truth , The richness and strength of the new wine of youth . But if , when the wine should have mellow 'd with time , Being bottled and binn 'd , to a flavor sublime , It retains the same acrid , incongruous taste , Why , the sooner to throw it away that we haste The better , I take it . And this vice of snarling , Self-love 's little lapdog , the overfed darling Of a hypochondriacal fancy appears , To my thinking , at least , in a man of your years , At the midnoon of manhood with plenty to do , And every incentive for doing it too , With the duties of life just sufficiently pressing For prayer , and of joys more than most men for blessing ; With a pretty young wife , and a pretty full purse , Like poltroonery , puerile truly , or worse ! I wish I could get you at least to agree To take life as it is , and consider with me , If it be not all smiles , that it is not all sneers ; It admits honest laughter , and needs honest tears . Do you think none have known but yourself all the pain Of hopes that retreat , and regrets that remain ? And all the wide distance fate fixes , no doubt , ‘ Twixt the life that 's within , and the life that 's without ? What one of us finds the world just as he likes ? Or gets what he wants when he wants it ? Or strikes Without missing the thing that he strikes at the first ? Or walks without stumbling ? Or quenches his thirst At one draught ? Bah ! I tell you ! I , bachelor John , Have had griefs of my own . But what then ? I push on All the faster perchance that I yet feel the pain Of my last fall , albeit I may stumble again . God means every man to be happy , be sure . He sends us no sorrows that have not some cure . Our duty down here is to do , not to know . Live as though life were earnest , and life will be so . Let each moment , like Time 's last ambassador , come : It will wait to deliver its message ; and some Sort of answer it merits . It is not the deed A man does , but the way that he does it , should plead For the man 's compensation in doing it . “ Here , My next neighbor 's a man with twelve thousand a year , Who deems that life has not a pastime more pleasant Than to follow a fox , or to slaughter a pheasant . Yet this fellow goes through a contested election , Lives in London , and sits , like the soul of dejection , All the day through upon a committee , and late To the last , every night , through the dreary debate , As though he were getting each speaker by heart , Though amongst them he never presumes to take part . One asks himself why , without murmur or question , He foregoes all his tastes , and destroys his digestion , For a labor of which the result seems so small . ‘ The man is ambitious , ’ you say . Not at all . He has just sense enough to be fully aware That he never can hope to be Premier , or share The renown of a Tully ;— or even to hold A subordinate office . He is not so bold As to fancy the House for ten minutes would bear With patience his modest opinions to hear . ‘ But he wants something ! ’ “ What ! with twelve thousand a year ? What could Government give him would be half so dear To his heart as a walk with a dog and a gun Through his own pheasant woods , or a capital run ? ‘ No ; but vanity fills out the emptiest brain ; The man would be more than his neighbor , ‘ tis plain ; And the drudgery drearily gone through in town Is more than repaid by provincial renown . Enough if some Marchioness , lively and loose , Shall have eyed him with passing complaisance ; the goose , If the Fashion to him open one of its doors , As proud as a sultan returns to his boors . ’ Wrong again ! if you think so , “ For , primo ; my friend Is the head of a family known from one end Of his shire to the other as the oldest ; and therefore He despises fine lords and fine ladies . HE care for A peerage ? no truly ! Secondo ; he rarely Or never goes out : dines at Bellamy 's sparely , And abhors what you call the gay world . “ Then , I ask , What inspires , and consoles , such a self-imposed task As the life of this man ,— but the sense of its duty ? And I swear that the eyes of the haughtiest beauty Have never inspired in my soul that intense , Reverential , and loving , and absolute sense Of heart-felt admiration I feel for this man , As I see him beside me ;— there , wearing the wan London daylight away , on his humdrum committee ; So unconscious of all that awakens my pity , And wonder — and worship , I might say ? “ To me There seems something nobler than genius to be In that dull patient labor no genius relieves , That absence of all joy which yet never grieves ; The humility of it ! the grandeur withal ! The sublimity of it ! And yet , should you call The man 's own very slow apprehension to this , He would ask , with a stare , what sublimity is ! His work is the duty to which he was born ; He accepts it , without ostentation or scorn : And this man is no uncommon type ( I thank Heaven ! ) Of this land 's common men . In all other lands , even The type 's self is wanting . Perchance , ‘ tis the reason That Government oscillates ever ‘ twixt treason And tyranny elsewhere . “ I wander away Too far , though , from what I was wishing to say . You , for instance , read Plato . You know that the soul Is immortal ; and put this in rhyme , on the whole , Very well , with sublime illustration . Man 's heart Is a mystery , doubtless . You trace it in art :— The Greek Psyche ,— that 's beauty ,— the perfect ideal . But then comes the imperfect , perfectible real , With its pain 'd aspiration and strife . In those pale Ill-drawn virgins of Giotto you see it prevail . You have studied all this . Then , the universe , too , Is not a mere house to be lived in , for you . Geology opens the mind . So you know Something also of strata and fossils ; these show The bases of cosmical structure : some mention Of the nebulous theory demands your attention ; And so on . “ In short , it is clear the interior Of your brain , my dear Alfred , is vastly superior In fibre , and fulness , and function , and fire , To that of my poor parliamentary squire ; But your life leaves upon me ( forgive me this heat Due to friendship ) the sense of a thing incomplete . You fly high . But what is it , in truth , you fly at ? My mind is not satisfied quite as to that . An old illustration 's as good as a new , Provided the old illustration be true . We are children . Mere kites are the fancies we fly , Though we marvel to see them ascending so high ; Things slight in themselves ,— long-tail 'd toys , and no more : What is it that makes the kite steadily soar Through the realms where the cloud and the whirlwind have birth But the tie that attaches the kite to the earth ? I remember the lessons of childhood , you see , And the hornbook I learn 'd on my poor mother 's knee . In truth , I suspect little else do we learn From this great book of life , which so shrewdly we turn , Saving how to apply , with a good or bad grace , What we learn 'd in the hornbook of childhood . “ Your case Is exactly in point . “ Fly your kite , if you please , Out of sight : let it go where it will , on the breeze ; But cut not the one thread by which it is bound , Be it never so high , to this poor human ground . No man is the absolute lord of his life . You , my friend , have a home , and a sweet and dear wife . If I often have sigh 'd by my own silent fire , With the sense of a sometimes recurring desire For a voice sweet and low , or a face fond and fair , Some dull winter evening to solace and share With the love which the world its good children allows To shake hands with ,— in short , a legitimate spouse , This thought has consoled me : ‘ At least I have given For my own good behavior no hostage to heaven . ’ You have , though . Forget it not ! faith , if you do , I would rather break stones on a road than be you . If any man wilfully injured , or led That little girl wrong , I would sit on his head , Even though you yourself were the sinner ! “ And this Leads me back ( do not take it , dear cousin , amiss ! ) To the matter I meant to have mention 'd at once , But these thoughts put it out of my head for the nonce . Of all the preposterous humbugs and shams , Of all the old wolves ever taken for lambs , The wolf best received by the flock he devours Is that uncle-in-law , my dear Alfred , of yours . At least , this has long been my unsettled conviction , And I almost would venture at once the prediction That before very long — but no matter ! I trust , For his sake and our own , that I may be unjust . But Heaven forgive me , if cautious I am on The score of such men as with both God and Mammon Seem so shrewdly familiar . “ Neglect not this warning . There were rumors afloat in the City this morning Which I scarce like the sound of . Who knows ? would he fleece At a pinch , the old hypocrite , even his own niece ? For the sake of Matilda I cannot importune Your attention too early . If all your wife 's fortune Is yet in the hands of that specious old sinner , Who would dice with the devil , and yet rise up winner , I say , lose no time ! get it out of the grab Of her trustee and uncle , Sir Ridley McNab . I trust those deposits , at least , are drawn out , And safe at this moment from danger or doubt . A wink is as good as a nod to the wise . Verbum sap . I admit nothing yet justifies My mistrust ; but I have in my own mind a notion That old Ridley 's white waistcoat , and airs of devotion , Have long been the only ostensible capital On which he does business . If so , time must sap it all , Sooner or later . Look sharp . Do not wait , Draw at once . In a fortnight it may be too late . I admit I know nothing . I can but suspect ; I give you my notions . Form yours and reflect . My love to Matilda . Her mother looks well . I saw her last week . I have nothing to tell Worth your hearing . We think that the Government here Will not last our next session . Fitz Funk is a peer , You will see by the Times . There are symptoms which show That the ministers now are preparing to go , And finish their feast of the loaves and the fishes . It is evident that they are clearing the dishes , And cramming their pockets with bonbons . Your news Will be always acceptable . Vere , of the Blues , Has bolted with Lady Selina . And so You have met with that hot-headed Frenchman ? I know That the man is a sad mauvais sujet . Take care Of Matilda . I wish I could join you both there ; But before I am free , you are sure to be gone . Good-by , my dear fellow . Yours , anxiously , JOHN . ”</head>

      <l n="4">In an unlucky hour , and received little heed .</l>
      <l n="5">A half-languid glance was the most that he lent at</l>

      <l n="9">Job 's self had Job known him . The more you 'd have thought</l>

      <l n="21">That Lucile and the Duke at the selfsame hotel</l>
      <l n="22">With the Vargraves resided . It needs not to tell</l>
      <l n="23">That they all saw too much of each other . The weather</l>
      <l n="24">Was so fine that it brought them each day all together</l>
      <l n="25">In the garden , to listen , of course , to the band .</l>
      <l n="26">The house was a sort of phalanstery ; and</l>
      <l n="27">Lucile and Matilda were pleased to discover</l>
      <l n="28">A mutual passion for music . Moreover ,</l>
      <l n="29">The Duke was an excellent tenor ; could sing</l>
      <l n="30">“ Ange si pure ” in a way to bring down on the wing</l>
      <l n="31">All the angels St. Cicely play 'd to . My lord</l>
      <l n="32">Would also , at times , when he was not too bored ,</l>
      <l n="33">Play Beethoven , and Wagner 's new music , not ill ;</l>
      <l n="34">With some little things of his own , showing skill .</l>
      <l n="35">For which reason , as well as for some others too ,</l>
      <l n="36">Their rooms were a pleasant enough rendezvous .</l>
      <l n="37">Did Lucile , then , encourage ( the heartless coquette ! )</l>

      <l n="90">Of the power and fame that seem 'd lost to his lot ,</l>

      <l n="94">“ One moment , dear jack !</l>
      <l n="95">We have grown up from boyhood together . Our track</l>
      <l n="96">Has been through the same meadows in childhood : in youth</l>
      <l n="97">Through the same silent gateways , to manhood . In truth ,</l>
      <l n="98">There is none that can know me as you do ; and none</l>
      <l n="99">To whom I more wish to believe myself known .</l>
      <l n="100">Speak the truth ; you are not wont to mince it , I know .</l>
      <l n="101">Nor I , shall I shirk it , or shrink from it now .</l>
      <l n="102">In despite of a wanton behavior , in spite</l>
      <l n="103">Of vanity , folly , and pride , Jack , which might</l>
      <l n="104">Have turn 'd from me many a heart strong and true</l>
      <l n="105">As your own , I have never turn 'd round and miss 'd YOU</l>
      <l n="106">From my side in one hour of affliction or doubt</l>
      <l n="107">By my own blind and heedless self-will brought about .</l>
      <l n="108">Tell me truth . Do I owe this alone to the sake</l>
      <l n="109">Of those old recollections of boyhood that make</l>
      <l n="110">In your heart yet some clinging and crying appeal</l>
      <l n="111">From a judgment more harsh , which I cannot but feel</l>
      <l n="112">Might have sentenced our friendship to death long ago ?</l>
      <l n="113">Or is it ... ( I would I could deem it were so ! )</l>
      <l n="114">That , not all overlaid by a listless exterior ,</l>
      <l n="115">Your heart has divined in me something superior</l>
      <l n="116">To that which I seem ; from my innermost nature</l>
      <l n="117">Not wholly expell 'd by the world 's usurpature ?</l>
      <l n="118">Some instinct of earnestness , truth , or desire</l>
      <l n="119">For truth ? Some one spark of the soul 's native fire</l>
      <l n="120">Moving under the ashes , and cinders , and dust</l>
      <l n="121">Which life hath heap 'd o'er it ? Some one fact to trust</l>
      <l n="122">And to hope in ? Or by you alone am I deem 'd</l>
      <l n="123">The mere frivolous fool I so often have seem 'd</l>
      <l n="124">To my own self ? ”</l>

      <l n="39">Upstarting , she then for the first time descried</l>
      <l n="40">That her husband was near her ; suffused with the blush</l>
      <l n="41">Which came o'er her soft pallid cheek with a gush</l>

      <l n="44">Shy with fear from the fern where some hunter approaches ,</l>
      <l n="45">She shrank back ; he caught her , and circling his arm</l>
      <l n="46">Round her waist , on her brow press 'd one kiss long and warm .</l>
      <l n="47">Then her fear changed in impulse ; and hiding her face</l>
      <l n="48">On his breast , she hung lock 'd in a clinging embrace</l>
      <l n="49">With her soft arms wound heavily round him , as though</l>
      <l n="50">She fear 'd , if their clasp was relaxed , he would go :</l>
      <l n="51">Her smooth , naked shoulders , uncared for , convulsed</l>
      <l n="52">By sob after sob , while her bosom yet pulsed</l>
      <l n="53">In its pressure on his , as the effort within it</l>
      <l n="54">Lived and died with each tender tumultuous minute .</l>
      <l n="55">“ O Alfred , O Alfred ! forgive me , ” she cried —</l>

      <l n="62">The canopy shading their couch , they sat down .</l>
      <l n="63">And he said , clasping firmly her hand in his own ,</l>
      <l n="64">“ When a proud man , Matilda , has found out at length ,</l>

      <l n="83">“ I ? ” she falter 'd , and timidly lifted her head .</l>
      <l n="84">“ Yes ! but first answer one other question , ” he said :</l>
      <l n="85">“ When a woman once feels that she is not alone :</l>
      <l n="86">That the heart of another is warm 'd by her own ;</l>
      <l n="87">That another feels with her whatever she feel</l>
      <l n="88">And halves her existence in woe or in weal ;</l>

      <l n="90">Live to put forth the strength which the thought of her gives ;</l>
      <l n="91">Live to shield her from want , and to share with her sorrow ;</l>
      <l n="92">Live to solace the day , and provide for the morrow :</l>
      <l n="93">Will that woman feel less than another , O say ,</l>
      <l n="94">The loss of what life , sparing this , takes away ?</l>
      <l n="95">Will she feel ( feeling this ) , when calamities come ,</l>
      <l n="96">That they brighten the heart , though they darken the home ? ”</l>
      <l n="97">She turn 'd , like a soft rainy heav'n , on him</l>
      <l n="98">Eyes that smiled through fresh tears , trustful , tender , and dim .</l>
      <l n="99">“ That woman , ” she murmur 'd , “ indeed were thrice blest ! ”</l>
      <l n="100">“ Then courage , true wife of my heart ! ” to his breast</l>
      <l n="101">As he folded and gather 'd her closely , he cried .</l>
      <l n="102">“ For the refuge , to-night in these arms open 'd wide</l>
      <l n="103">To your heart , can be never closed to it again ,</l>
      <l n="104">And this room is for both an asylum ! For when</l>
      <l n="105">I pass 'd through that door , at the door I left there</l>

      <l n="107">One step from that threshold , and daily , I fear ,</l>
      <l n="108">We must face it henceforth ; but it enters not here ,</l>
      <l n="109">For that door shuts it out , and admits here alone</l>

      <l n="111">She started ... “ Calamity , Alfred , to you ? ”</l>
      <l n="112">“ To both , my poor child , but ‘ twill bring with it too</l>

      <l n="114">“ O speak !</l>
      <l n="115">Speak ! ” she falter 'd in tones timid , anxious , and weak .</l>
      <l n="116">“ O yet for a moment , ” he said , “ hear me on !</l>
      <l n="117">Matilda , this morn we went forth in the sun ,</l>
      <l n="118">Like those children of sunshine , the bright summer flies ,</l>
      <l n="119">That sport in the sunbeam , and play through the skies</l>
      <l n="120">While the skies smile , and heed not each other : at last ,</l>
      <l n="121">When their sunbeam is gone , and their sky overcast ,</l>
      <l n="122">Who recks in what ruin they fold their wet wings ?</l>

      <l n="127">Yes ; you , too , have wept !</l>
      <l n="128">“ While the world was yet ours ,</l>
      <l n="129">While its sun was upon us , its incense stream 'd to us ,</l>
      <l n="130">And its myriad voices of joy seem 'd to woo us ,</l>
      <l n="131">We stray 'd from each other , too far , it may be ,</l>
      <l n="132">Nor , wantonly wandering , then did I see</l>
      <l n="133">How deep was my need of thee , dearest , how great</l>
      <l n="134">Was thy claim on my heart and thy share in my fate !</l>
      <l n="135">But , Matilda , an angel was near us , meanwhile ,</l>
      <l n="136">Watching o'er us to warn , and to rescue !</l>
      <l n="137">“ That smile</l>
      <l n="138">Which you saw with suspicion , that presence you eyed</l>
      <l n="139">With resentment , an angel 's they were at your side</l>
      <l n="140">And at mine ; nor perchance is the day all so far ,</l>
      <l n="141">When we both in our prayers , when most heartfelt they are ,</l>
      <l n="142">May murmur the name of that woman now gone</l>
      <l n="143">From our sight evermore .</l>
      <l n="144">“ Here , this evening , alone ,</l>
      <l n="145">I seek your forgiveness , in opening my heart</l>
      <l n="146">Unto yours ,— from this clasp be it never to part !</l>
      <l n="147">Matilda , the fortune you brought me is gone ,</l>
      <l n="148">But a prize richer far than that fortune has won</l>
      <l n="149">It is yours to confer , and I kneel for that prize ,</l>
      <l n="150">‘ Tis the heart of my wife ! ” With suffused happy eyes</l>
      <l n="151">She sprang from her seat , flung her arms wide apart ,</l>
      <l n="152">And tenderly closing them round him , his heart</l>
      <l n="153">Clasp 'd in one close embrace to her bosom ; and there</l>
      <l n="154">Droop 'd her head on his shoulder ; and sobb 'd .</l>
      <l n="155">Not despair ,</l>
      <l n="156">Not sorrow , not even the sense of her loss ,</l>
      <l n="157">Flow 'd in those happy tears , so oblivious she was</l>
      <l n="158">Of all save the sense of her own love ! Anon ,</l>
      <l n="159">However , his words rush 'd back to her . “ All gone ,</l>
      <l n="160">The fortune you brought me ! ”</l>
      <l n="161">And eyes that were dim</l>
      <l n="162">With soft tears she upraised ; but those tears were for HIM .</l>
      <l n="163">“ Gone ! my husband ? ” she said , ” tell me all ! see ! I need ,</l>
      <l n="164">To sober this rapture , so selfish indeed ,</l>
      <l n="165">Fuller sense of affliction . ”</l>
      <l n="166">“ Poor innocent child ! ”</l>
      <l n="167">He kiss 'd her fair forehead , and mournfully smiled ,</l>
      <l n="168">As he told her the tale he had heard — something more ,</l>
      <l n="169">The gain found in loss of what gain lost of yore .</l>
      <l n="170">“ Rest , my heart , and my brain , and my right hand , for you ;</l>
      <l n="171">And with these , my Matilda , what may I not do ?</l>
      <l n="172">And know not , I knew not myself till this hour ,</l>
      <l n="173">Which so sternly reveal 'd it , my nature 's full power . ”</l>
      <l n="174">“ And I too , ” she murmur 'd , “ I too am no more</l>
      <l n="175">The mere infant at heart you have known me before .</l>
      <l n="176">I have suffer 'd since then . I have learn 'd much in life .</l>

      <l n="181">Less from him , than herself , what that motion express 'd ,</l>
      <l n="182">She dropp 'd her bright head , and hid all on his breast .</l>

      <l n="1757">“ Say , ”</l>
      <l n="1758">Said the Soeur Seraphine — “ are you able to lay</l>

      <l n="1762">“ How so ? ”</l>
      <l n="1763">He look 'd up . “ if the boy should die thus ? ”</l>

      <l n="1770">With slow heavy stride ,</l>
      <l n="1771">Unheeding her words , he was pacing the tent ,</l>
      <l n="1772">He was muttering low to himself as he went .</l>
      <l n="1773">Ay , these young things lie safe in our heart just so long</l>
      <l n="1774">As their wings are in growing ; and when these are strong</l>
      <l n="1775">They break it , and farewell ! the bird flies ! ” ...</l>
      <l n="1776">The nun</l>
      <l n="1777">Laid her hand on the soldier , and murmur 'd , “ The sun</l>
      <l n="1778">Is descending , life fleets while we talk thus ! oh , yet</l>
      <l n="1779">Let this day upon one final victory set ,</l>
      <l n="1780">And complete a life 's conquest ! ”</l>
      <l n="1781">He said , “ Understand !</l>

      <l n="1783">My heart hath been robb 'd , she is lost to my life !</l>
      <l n="1784">Can her home be my home ? Can I claim in the wife</l>
      <l n="1785">Of that man 's son the child of my age ? At her side</l>

      <l n="1800">“ O think not , ” she said , “ of the son</l>
      <l n="1801">Of the man whom unjustly you hate ; only think</l>
      <l n="1802">Of this young human creature , that cries from the brink</l>

      <l n="1804">“ Recall your own words</l>

      <l n="1807">Look with me ( still those words in our ears ! ) once again</l>
      <l n="1808">At this young soldier sinking from life here — dragg 'd down</l>
      <l n="1809">By the weight of the love in his heart : no renown ,</l>
      <l n="1810">No fame comforts HIM ! nations shout not above</l>

      <l n="1815">Through the deeds it hath wrought to the fame it hath won ,</l>
      <l n="1816">By recalling the visions and dreams of a youth ,</l>
      <l n="1817">Such as lies at your door now : who have but , in truth ,</l>
      <l n="1818">To stretch forth a hand , to speak only one word ,</l>
      <l n="1819">And by that word you rescue a life ! ”</l>
      <l n="1820">He was stirr 'd .</l>
      <l n="1821">Still he sought to put from him the cup , bow 'd his face</l>
      <l n="1822">on his hand ; and anon , as though wishing to chase</l>
      <l n="1823">With one angry gesture his own thoughts aside ,</l>
      <l n="1824">He sprang up , brush 'd past her , and bitterly cried ,</l>
      <l n="1825">“ No !— Constance wed a Vargrave ! ” — I cannot consent ! ”</l>
      <l n="1826">Then up rose the Soeur Seraphine .</l>
      <l n="1827">The low tent</l>
      <l n="1828">In her sudden uprising , seem 'd dwarf 'd by the height</l>
      <l n="1829">From which those imperial eyes pour 'd the light</l>
      <l n="1830">Of their deep silent sadness upon him .</l>
      <l n="1831">No wonder</l>
      <l n="1832">He felt , as it were , his own stature shrink under</l>
      <l n="1833">The compulsion of that grave regard ! For between</l>
      <l n="1834">The Duc de Luvois and the Soeur Seraphine</l>
      <l n="1835">At that moment there rose all the height of one soul</l>
      <l n="1836">O'er another ; she look 'd down on him from the whole</l>
      <l n="1837">Lonely length of a life . There were sad nights and days ,</l>
      <l n="1838">There were long months and years in that heart-searching gaze ;</l>
      <l n="1839">And her voice , when she spoke , with sharp pathos thrill 'd through</l>
      <l n="1840">And transfix 'd him .</l>
      <l n="1841">“ Eugene de Luvois , but for you ,</l>
      <l n="1842">I might have been now — not this wandering nun ,</l>
      <l n="1843">But a mother , a wife — pleading , not for the son</l>
      <l n="1844">Of another , but blessing some child of my own ,</l>
      <l n="1845">His ,— the man 's that I once loved !... Hush ! that which is done</l>
      <l n="1846">I regret not . I breathe no reproaches . That 's best</l>
      <l n="1847">Which God sends . ‘ Twas his will : it is mine . And the rest</l>
      <l n="1848">Of that riddle I will not look back to . He reads</l>
      <l n="1849">In your heart — He that judges of all thoughts and deeds .</l>
      <l n="1850">With eyes , mine forestall not ! This only I say :</l>

      <l n="1853">“ Have I wrong 'd thee ?— wrong 'd THEE ! ”</l>
      <l n="1854">He falter 'd , “ Lucile , ah , Lucile ! ”</l>
      <l n="1855">“ Nay , not me , ”</l>
      <l n="1856">She murmur 'd , “ but man ! The lone nun standing here</l>
      <l n="1857">Has no claim upon earth , and is pass 'd from the sphere</l>

      <l n="1862">This voice from the grave ! ”</l>
      <l n="1863">“ Hush ! ” he moan 'd , “ I obey</l>
      <l n="1864">The Soeur Seraphine . There , Lucile ! let this pay</l>
      <l n="1865">Every debt that is due to that grave . Now lead on :</l>
      <l n="1866">I follow you , Soeur Seraphine !... To the son</l>

      <l n="1868">As he spoke</l>
      <l n="1869">He lifted the tent-door , and down the dun smoke</l>
      <l n="1870">Pointed out the dark bastions , with batteries crown 'd ,</l>

     <l n="1">Enough ! Hear at last , then , the truth</l>
     <l n="2">Your father and I — foes we were in our youth .</l>
     <l n="3">It matters not why . Yet thus much understand :</l>
     <l n="4">The hope of my youth was sign 'd out by his hand .</l>
     <l n="5">I was not of those whom the buffets of fate</l>
     <l n="6">Tame and teach ; and my heart buried slain love in hate .</l>
     <l n="7">If your own frank young heart , yet unconscious of all</l>
     <l n="8">Which turns the heart 's blood in its springtide to gall ,</l>
     <l n="9">And unable to guess even aught that the furrow</l>
     <l n="10">Across these gray brows hides of sin or of sorrow ,</l>
     <l n="11">Comprehends not the evil and grief of my life ,</l>
     <l n="12">‘ Twill at least comprehend how intense was the strife</l>
     <l n="13">Which is closed in this act of atonement , whereby</l>
     <l n="14">I seek in the son of my youth 's enemy</l>
     <l n="15">The friend of my age . Let the present release</l>
     <l n="16">Here acquitted the past ! In the name of my niece ,</l>
     <l n="17">Whom for my life in yours as a hostage I give ,</l>
     <l n="18">Are you great enough , boy , to forgive me ,— and live ?</l>

     <l n="19">Whilst he spoke thus , a doubtful tumultuous joy</l>
     <l n="20">Chased its fleeting effects o'er the face of the boy :</l>
     <l n="21">As when some stormy moon , in a long cloud confined ,</l>
     <l n="22">Struggles outward through shadows , the varying wind</l>
     <l n="23">Alternates , and bursts , self-surprised , from her prison ,</l>
     <l n="24">So that slow joy grew clear in his face . He had risen</l>
     <l n="25">To answer the Duke ; but strength fail 'd every limb ;</l>
     <l n="26">A strange , happy feebleness trembled through him .</l>
     <l n="27">With a faint cry of rapturous wonder , he sank</l>
     <l n="28">On the breast of the nun , who stood near .</l>
     <l n="29">“ Yes , boy ! thank</l>
     <l n="30">This guardian angel , ” the Duke said . “ I — you ,</l>
     <l n="31">We owe all to her . Crown her work . Live ! be true</l>
     <l n="32">To your young life 's fair promise , and live for her sake ! ”</l>
     <l n="33">“ Yes , Duke : I will live . I MUST live — live to make</l>
     <l n="34">My whole life the answer you claim , ” the boy said ,</l>
     <l n="35">“ For joy does not kill ! ”</l>
     <l n="36">Back again the faint head</l>
     <l n="37">Declined on the nun 's gentle bosom . She saw</l>
     <l n="38">His lips quiver , and motion 'd the Duke to withdraw</l>
     <l n="39">And leave them a moment together .</l>
     <l n="40">He eyed</l>
     <l n="41">Them both with a wistful regard ; turn 'd and sigh 'd ,</l>
     <l n="42">And lifted the tent-door , and pass 'd from the tent .</l>
