    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Beat ! beat ! drums !— blow ! bugles ! blow !</l>
     <l n="2">Through the windows — through doors — burst like a ruthless force ,</l>
     <l n="3">Into the solemn church , and scatter the congregation ,</l>
     <l n="4">Into the school where the scholar is studying ;</l>
     <l n="5">Leave not the bridegroom quiet — no happiness must he have now with his</l>
     <l n="6">bride ,</l>
     <l n="7">Not the peaceful farmer any peace , ploughing his field or gathering his</l>
     <l n="8">grain ,</l>

     <l n="16">Would the talkers be talking ? would the singer attempt to sing ?</l>
     <l n="17">Would the lawyer rise in the court to state his case before the judge ?</l>

     <l n="23">Let not the child 's voice be heard , nor the mother 's entreaties ,</l>
     <l n="24">Make even the trestles to shake the dead where they lie awaiting the</l>

     <l n="9">City of wharves and stores — city of tall façades of marble and iron !</l>
     <l n="10">Proud and passionate city — mettlesome , mad , extravagant city !</l>

    <head>A MARCH IN THE RANKS HARD-PREST , AND THE ROAD UNKNOWN</head>
     <l n="1">A march in the ranks hard-prest , and the road unknown ,</l>
     <l n="2">A route through a heavy wood with muffled steps in the darkness ,</l>
     <l n="3">Our army foil 'd with loss severe , and the sullen remnant retreating ,</l>
     <l n="4">Till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dim-lighted</l>
     <l n="5">building ,</l>
     <l n="6">We come to an open space in the woods , and halt by the dim-lighted</l>
     <l n="7">building ,</l>
     <l n="8">‘ Tis a large old church at the crossing roads , now an impromptu</l>
     <l n="9">hospital ,</l>
     <l n="10">Entering but for a minute I see a sight beyond all the pictures and</l>
     <l n="11">poems ever made ,</l>
     <l n="12">Shadows of deepest , deepest black , just lit by moving candles and</l>
     <l n="13">lamps ,</l>
     <l n="14">And by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and</l>
     <l n="15">clouds of smoke ,</l>
     <l n="16">By these , crowds , groups of forms vaguely I see on the floor , some</l>
     <l n="17">in the pews laid down ,</l>
     <l n="18">At my feet more distinctly a soldier , a mere lad , in danger of</l>
     <l n="19">bleeding to death ( he is shot in the abdomen ) ,</l>
     <l n="20">I stanch the blood temporarily ( the youngster 's face is white as a</l>
     <l n="21">lily ) ,</l>
     <l n="22">Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o'er the scene fain to absorb</l>
     <l n="23">it all ,</l>
     <l n="24">Faces , varieties , postures beyond description , most in obscurity ,</l>
     <l n="25">some of them dead ,</l>
     <l n="26">Surgeons operating , attendants holding lights , the smell of ether , the</l>
     <l n="27">odour of blood ,</l>
     <l n="28">The crowd , O the crowd of the bloody forms , the yard outside also</l>
     <l n="29">fill 'd ,</l>
     <l n="30">Some on the bare ground , some on planks or stretchers , some in the</l>
     <l n="31">death-spasm sweating ,</l>
     <l n="32">An occasional scream or cry , the doctor 's shouted orders or calls ,</l>
     <l n="33">The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of the</l>
     <l n="34">torches ,</l>
     <l n="35">These I resume as I chant , I see again the forms , I smell the odour ,</l>
     <l n="36">Then hear outside the orders given , Fall in , my men , fall in ;</l>
     <l n="37">But first I bend to the dying lad , his eyes open , a half-smile gives</l>
     <l n="38">he me ,</l>
     <l n="39">Then the eyes close , calmly close , and I speed forth to the darkness ,</l>
     <l n="40">Resuming , marching , ever in darkness marching , on in the ranks ,</l>
     <l n="41">The unknown road still marching .</l>

    <head>COME UP FROM THE FIELDS FATHER</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Come up from the fields father , here 's a letter from our Pete ,</l>
     <l n="2">And come to the front door mother , here 's a letter from thy dear son .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">Lo , ‘ tis autumn ,</l>
     <l n="4">Lo , where the trees , deeper green , yellower and redder ,</l>
     <l n="5">Cool and sweeten Ohio 's villages with leaves fluttering in the moderate</l>
     <l n="6">wind ,</l>
     <l n="7">Where apples ripe in the orchards hang and grapes on the trellis 'd</l>
     <l n="8">vines</l>
     <l n="9">( Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines ?</l>
     <l n="10">Smell you the buckwheat where the bees were lately buzzing ? ) ,</l>
     <l n="11">Above all , lo , the sky so calm , so transparent after the rain , and with</l>
     <l n="12">wondrous clouds ,</l>
     <l n="13">Below too , all calm , all vital and beautiful , and the farm prospers</l>
     <l n="14">well .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">Down in the fields all prospers well ,</l>
     <l n="16">But now from the fields come father , come at the daughter 's call ,</l>
     <l n="17">And come to the entry mother , to the front door come right away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="18">Fast as she can she hurries , something ominous , her steps trembling ,</l>
     <l n="19">She does not tarry to smooth her hair nor adjust her cap .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="20">Open the envelope quickly ,</l>
     <l n="21">O this is not our son 's writing , yet his name is sign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="22">O a strange hand writes for our dear son , O stricken mother 's soul !</l>
     <l n="23">All swims before her eyes , flashes with black , she catches the main</l>
     <l n="24">words only ,</l>
     <l n="25">Sentences broken , gunshot wound in the breast , cavalry skirmish , taken</l>
     <l n="26">to hospital ,</l>
     <l n="27">At present low , but will soon be better .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="28">Ah now the single figure to me ,</l>
     <l n="29">Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio with all its cities and farms ,</l>
     <l n="30">Sickly white in the face and dull in the head , very faint ,</l>
     <l n="31">By the jamb of a door leans .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Grieve not so , dear mother ( the just-grown daughter speaks through her sobs , The little sisters huddle around speechless and dismay 'd ) , See , dearest mother , the letter says Pete will soon be better .</p>
   <p>Alas poor boy , he will never be better ( nor may be needs to be better , that brave and simple soul ) , While they stand at home at the door he is dead already , The only son is dead .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">But the mother needs to be better ,</l>
     <l n="2">She with thin form presently drest in black ,</l>
     <l n="3">By day her meals untouch 'd , then at night fitfully sleeping , often</l>
     <l n="4">waking ,</l>
     <l n="5">In the midnight waking , weeping , longing with one deep longing ,</l>
     <l n="6">O that she might withdraw unnoticed , silent from life escape and</l>
     <l n="7">withdraw ,</l>
     <l n="8">To follow , to seek , to be with her dear dead son .</l>

    <head>A TWILIGHT SONG</head>
     <l n="1">As I sit in twilight late alone by the flickering oak-flame ,</l>
     <l n="2">Musing on long-pass 'd war-scenes — of the countless buried unknown</l>
     <l n="3">soldiers ,</l>
     <l n="4">Of the vacant names , as unindented air 's and sea 's — the unreturn 'd ,</l>
     <l n="5">The brief truce after battle , with grim burial-squads , and the</l>
     <l n="6">deep-fill 'd trenches</l>
     <l n="7">Of gather 'd dead from all America , North , South , East , West , whence</l>
     <l n="8">they came up ,</l>
     <l n="9">From wooded Maine , New-England 's farms , from fertile Pennsylvania ,</l>
     <l n="10">Illinois , Ohio ,</l>
     <l n="11">From the measureless West , Virginia , the South , the Carolinas , Texas</l>
     <l n="12">( Even here in my room-shadows and half-lights in the noiseless</l>
     <l n="13">flickering flames ,</l>
     <l n="14">Again I see the stalwart ranks on-filing , rising — I hear the rhythmic</l>
     <l n="15">tramp of the armies ) ;</l>
     <l n="16">You million unwrit names all , all — you dark bequest from all the war ,</l>
     <l n="17">A special verse for you — a flash of duty long neglected — your mystic</l>
     <l n="18">roll strangely gather 'd here ,</l>
     <l n="19">Each name recall 'd by me from out the darkness and death 's ashes ,</l>
     <l n="20">Henceforth to be , deep , deep within my heart recording , for many a</l>

     <l n="1">A sight in camp in the daybreak gray and dim ,</l>

     <l n="5">Three forms I see on stretchers lying , brought out there untended</l>
     <l n="6">lying ,</l>
     <l n="7">Over each the blanket spread , ample brownish woollen blanket ,</l>
     <l n="8">Gray and heavy blanket , folding , covering all .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Curious I halt and silent stand ,</l>
     <l n="10">Then with light fingers I from the face of the nearest the first</l>
     <l n="11">just lift the blanket ;</l>
     <l n="12">Who are you elderly man so gaunt and grim , with well-gray 'd hair ,</l>
     <l n="13">and flesh all sunken about the eyes ?</l>
     <l n="14">Who are you my dear comrade ?</l>

     <l n="17">Then to the third — a face nor child nor old , very calm , as of beautiful</l>
     <l n="18">yellow-white ivory ;</l>
     <l n="19">Young man I think I know you — I think this face is the face of the</l>

     <l n="1">Year that trembled and reel 'd beneath me !</l>
     <l n="2">Your summer wind was warm enough , yet the air I breathed froze me ,</l>
     <l n="3">A thick gloom fell through the sunshine and darken 'd me ,</l>
     <l n="4">Must I change my triumphant songs ? said I to myself ,</l>

   <p>Lull 'd and late is the smoke of the First-day morning , It hangs low over the rows of trees by the fences , It hangs thin by the sassafras and wild-cherry and cat-brier under them .</p>
   <p>I saw the rich ladies in full dress at the soiree , I heard what the singers were singing so long , Heard who sprang in crimson youth from the white froth and the water-blue .</p>
   <p>Behold a woman ! She looks out from her quaker cap , her face is clearer and more beautiful than the sky .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">She sits in an armchair under the shaded porch of the farmhouse ,</l>
     <l n="2">The sun just shines on her old white head .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Her ample gown is of cream-hued linen , Her grandsons raised the flax , and her granddaughters spun it with the distaff and the wheel .</p>

     <l n="1">The melodious character of the earth ,</l>
     <l n="2">The finish beyond which philosophy cannot go and does not wish to go ,</l>
