      <head>PRELUDE .</head>
      <head>THE WAYSIDE INN .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">One Autumn night , in Sudbury town ,</l>
       <l n="2">Across the meadows bare and brown ,</l>
       <l n="3">The windows of the wayside inn</l>
       <l n="4">Gleamed red with fire-light through the leaves</l>
       <l n="5">Of woodbine , hanging from the eaves</l>
       <l n="6">Their crimson curtains rent and thin .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">As ancient is this hostelry</l>
       <l n="8">As any in the land may be ,</l>
       <l n="9">Built in the old Colonial day ,</l>
       <l n="10">When men lived in a grander way ,</l>
       <l n="11">With ampler hospitality ;</l>
       <l n="12">A kind of old Hobgoblin Hall ,</l>
       <l n="13">Now somewhat fallen to decay ,</l>
       <l n="14">With weather-stains upon the wall ,</l>
       <l n="15">And stairways worn , and crazy doors ,</l>
       <l n="16">And creaking and uneven floors ,</l>
       <l n="17">And chimneys huge , and tiled and tall .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="18">A region of repose it seems ,</l>
       <l n="19">A place of slumber and of dreams ,</l>
       <l n="20">Remote among the wooded hills !</l>
       <l n="21">For there no noisy railway speeds ,</l>
       <l n="22">Its torch-race scattering smoke and gleeds ;</l>
       <l n="23">But noon and night , the panting teams</l>
       <l n="24">Stop under the great oaks , that throw</l>
       <l n="25">Tangles of light and shade below ,</l>
       <l n="26">On roofs and doors and window-sills .</l>
       <l n="27">Across the road the barns display</l>
       <l n="28">Their lines of stalls , their mows of hay ,</l>
       <l n="29">Through the wide doors the breezes blow ,</l>
       <l n="30">The wattled cocks strut to and fro ,</l>
       <l n="31">And , half effaced by rain and shine ,</l>
       <l n="32">The Red Horse prances on the sign .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="33">Round this old-fashioned , quaint abode</l>
       <l n="34">Deep silence reigned , save when a gust</l>
       <l n="35">Went rushing down the county road ,</l>
       <l n="36">And skeletons of leaves , and dust ,</l>
       <l n="37">A moment quickened by its breath ,</l>
       <l n="38">Shuddered and danced their dance of death ,</l>
       <l n="39">And through the ancient oaks o'erhead</l>
       <l n="40">Mysterious voices moaned and fled .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="41">But from the parlor of the inn</l>
       <l n="42">A pleasant murmur smote the ear ,</l>
       <l n="43">Like water rushing through a weir ;</l>
       <l n="44">Oft interrupted by the din</l>
       <l n="45">Of laughter and of loud applause ,</l>
       <l n="46">And , in each intervening pause ,</l>
       <l n="47">The music of a violin .</l>
       <l n="48">The fire-light , shedding over all</l>
       <l n="49">The splendor of its ruddy glow ,</l>
       <l n="50">Filled the whole parlor large and low ;</l>
       <l n="51">It gleamed on wainscot and on wall ,</l>
       <l n="52">It touched with more than wonted grace</l>
       <l n="53">Fair Princess Mary 's pictured face ;</l>
       <l n="54">It bronzed the rafters overhead ,</l>
       <l n="55">On the old spinet 's ivory keys</l>
       <l n="56">It played inaudible melodies ,</l>
       <l n="57">It crowned the sombre clock with flame ,</l>
       <l n="58">The hands , the hours , the maker 's name ,</l>
       <l n="59">And painted with a livelier red</l>
       <l n="60">The Landlord 's coat-of-arms again ;</l>
       <l n="61">And , flashing on the window-pane ,</l>
       <l n="62">Emblazoned with its light and shade</l>
       <l n="63">The jovial rhymes , that still remain ,</l>
       <l n="64">Writ near a century ago ,</l>
       <l n="65">By the great Major Molineaux ,</l>
       <l n="66">Whom Hawthorne has immortal made .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="67">Before the blazing fire of wood</l>
       <l n="68">Erect the rapt musician stood ;</l>
       <l n="69">And ever and anon he bent</l>
       <l n="70">His head upon his instrument ,</l>
       <l n="71">And seemed to listen , till he caught</l>
       <l n="72">Confessions of its secret thought ,—</l>
       <l n="73">The joy , the triumph , the lament ,</l>
       <l n="74">The exultation and the pain ;</l>
       <l n="75">Then , by the magic of his art ,</l>
       <l n="76">He soothed the throbbings of its heart ,</l>
       <l n="77">And lulled it into peace again .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="78">Around the fireside at their ease</l>
       <l n="79">There sat a group of friends , entranced</l>
       <l n="80">With the delicious melodies ;</l>
       <l n="81">Who from the far-off noisy town</l>
       <l n="82">Had to the wayside inn come down ,</l>
       <l n="83">To rest beneath its old oak-trees .</l>
       <l n="84">The fire-light on their faces glanced ,</l>
       <l n="85">Their shadows on the wainscot danced ,</l>
       <l n="86">And , though of different lands and speech ,</l>
       <l n="87">Each had his tale to tell , and each</l>
       <l n="88">Was anxious to be pleased and please .</l>
       <l n="89">And while the sweet musician plays ,</l>
       <l n="90">Let me in outline sketch them all ,</l>
       <l n="91">Perchance uncouthly as the blaze</l>
       <l n="92">With its uncertain touch portrays</l>
       <l n="93">Their shadowy semblance on the wall .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="94">But first the Landlord will I trace ;</l>
       <l n="95">Grave in his aspect and attire ;</l>
       <l n="96">A man of ancient pedigree ,</l>
       <l n="97">A Justice of the Peace was he ,</l>
       <l n="98">Known in all Sudbury as “ The Squire . ”</l>
       <l n="99">Proud was he of his name and race ,</l>
       <l n="100">Of old Sir William and Sir Hugh ,</l>
       <l n="101">And in the parlor , full in view ,</l>
       <l n="102">His coat-of-arms , well framed and glazed ,</l>
       <l n="103">Upon the wall in colors blazed ;</l>
       <l n="104">He beareth gules upon his shield ,</l>
       <l n="105">A chevron argent in the field ,</l>
       <l n="106">With three wolf 's heads , and for the crest</l>
       <l n="107">A Wyvern part-per-pale addressed</l>
       <l n="108">Upon a helmet barred ; below</l>
       <l n="109">The scroll reads , “ By the name of Howe . ”</l>
       <l n="110">And over this , no longer bright ,</l>
       <l n="111">Though glimmering with a latent light ,</l>
       <l n="112">Was hung the sword his grandsire bore ,</l>
       <l n="113">In the rebellious days of yore ,</l>
       <l n="114">Down there at Concord in the fight .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="115">A youth was there , of quiet ways ,</l>
       <l n="116">A Student of old books and days ,</l>
       <l n="117">To whom all tongues and lands were known ,</l>
       <l n="118">And yet a lover of his own ;</l>
       <l n="119">With many a social virtue graced ,</l>
       <l n="120">And yet a friend of solitude ;</l>
       <l n="121">A man of such a genial mood</l>
       <l n="122">The heart of all things he embraced ,</l>
       <l n="123">And yet of such fastidious taste ,</l>
       <l n="124">He never found the best too good .</l>
       <l n="125">Books were his passion and delight ,</l>
       <l n="126">And in his upper room at home</l>
       <l n="127">Stood many a rare and sumptuous tome ,</l>
       <l n="128">In vellum bound , with gold bedight ,</l>
       <l n="129">Great volumes garmented in white ,</l>
       <l n="130">Recalling Florence , Pisa , Rome .</l>
       <l n="131">He loved the twilight that surrounds</l>
       <l n="132">The border-land of old romance ;</l>
       <l n="133">Where glitter hauberk , helm , and lance ,</l>
       <l n="134">And banner waves , and trumpet sounds ,</l>
       <l n="135">And ladies ride with hawk on wrist ,</l>
       <l n="136">And mighty warriors sweep along ,</l>
       <l n="137">Magnified by the purple mist ,</l>
       <l n="138">The dusk of centuries and of song .</l>
       <l n="139">The chronicles of Charlemagne ,</l>
       <l n="140">Of Merlin and the Mort d'Arthure ,</l>
       <l n="141">Mingled together in his brain</l>
       <l n="142">With tales of Flores and Blanchefleur ,</l>
       <l n="143">Sir Ferumbras , Sir Eglamour ,</l>
       <l n="144">Sir Launcelot , Sir Morgadour ,</l>
       <l n="145">Sir Guy , Sir Bevis , Sir Gawain .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="146">A young Sicilian , too , was there ;—</l>
       <l n="147">In sight of Etna born and bred ,</l>
       <l n="148">Some breath of its volcanic air</l>
       <l n="149">Was glowing in his heart and brain ,</l>
       <l n="150">And , being rebellious to his liege ,</l>
       <l n="151">After Palermo 's fatal siege ,</l>
       <l n="152">Across the western seas he fled ,</l>
       <l n="153">In good King Bomba 's happy reign .</l>
       <l n="154">His face was like a summer night ,</l>
       <l n="155">All flooded with a dusky light ;</l>
       <l n="156">His hands were small ; his teeth shone white</l>
       <l n="157">As sea-shells , when he smiled or spoke ;</l>
       <l n="158">His sinews supple and strong as oak ;</l>
       <l n="159">Clean shaven was he as a priest ,</l>
       <l n="160">Who at the mass on Sunday sings ,</l>
       <l n="161">Save that upon his upper lip</l>
       <l n="162">His beard , a good palm 's length at least ,</l>
       <l n="163">Level and pointed at the tip ,</l>
       <l n="164">Shot sideways , like a swallow 's wings .</l>
       <l n="165">The poets read he o'er and o'er ,</l>
       <l n="166">And most of all the Immortal Four</l>
       <l n="167">Of Italy ; and next to those ,</l>
       <l n="168">The story-telling bard of prose ,</l>
       <l n="169">Who wrote the joyous Tuscan tales</l>
       <l n="170">Of the Decameron , that make</l>
       <l n="171">Fiesole 's green hills and vales</l>
       <l n="172">Remembered for Boccaccio 's sake .</l>
       <l n="173">Much too of music was his thought ;</l>
       <l n="174">The melodies and measures fraught</l>
       <l n="175">With sunshine and the open air ,</l>
       <l n="176">Of vineyards and the singing sea</l>
       <l n="177">Of his beloved Sicily ;</l>
       <l n="178">And much it pleased him to peruse</l>
       <l n="179">The songs of the Sicilian muse ,—</l>
       <l n="180">Bucolic songs by Meli sung</l>
       <l n="181">In the familiar peasant tongue ,</l>
       <l n="182">That made men say , “ Behold ! once more</l>
       <l n="183">The pitying gods to earth restore</l>
       <l n="184">Theocritus of Syracuse ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="185">A Spanish Jew from Alicant</l>
       <l n="186">With aspect grand and grave was there ;</l>
       <l n="187">Vender of silks and fabrics rare ,</l>
       <l n="188">And attar of rose from the Levant .</l>
       <l n="189">Like an old Patriarch he appeared ,</l>
       <l n="190">Abraham or Isaac , or at least</l>
       <l n="191">Some later Prophet or High-Priest ;</l>
       <l n="192">With lustrous eyes , and olive skin ,</l>
       <l n="193">And , wildly tossed from cheeks and chin ,</l>
       <l n="194">The tumbling cataract of his beard .</l>
       <l n="195">His garments breathed a spicy scent</l>
       <l n="196">Of cinnamon and sandal blent ,</l>
       <l n="197">Like the soft aromatic gales</l>
       <l n="198">That meet the mariner , who sails</l>
       <l n="199">Through the Moluccas , and the seas</l>
       <l n="200">That wash the shores of Celebes .</l>
       <l n="201">All stories that recorded are</l>
       <l n="202">By Pierre Alphonse he knew by heart ,</l>
       <l n="203">And it was rumored he could say</l>
       <l n="204">The Parables of Sandabar ,</l>
       <l n="205">And all the Fables of Pilpay ,</l>
       <l n="206">Or if not all , the greater part !</l>
       <l n="207">Well versed was he in Hebrew books ,</l>
       <l n="208">Talmud and Targum , and the lore</l>
       <l n="209">Of Kabala ; and evermore</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Listen , my children , and you shall hear</l>
       <l n="2">Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere ,</l>
       <l n="3">On the eighteenth of April , in Seventy-five ;</l>
       <l n="4">Hardly a man is now alive</l>
       <l n="5">Who remembers that famous day and year .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="6">He said to his friend , “ If the British march</l>
       <l n="7">By land or sea from the town to-night ,</l>
       <l n="8">Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch</l>
       <l n="9">Of the North Church tower as a signal light ,—</l>
       <l n="10">One , if by land , and two , if by sea ;</l>
       <l n="11">And I on the opposite shore will be ,</l>
       <l n="12">Ready to ride and spread the alarm</l>
       <l n="13">Through every Middlesex village and farm ,</l>
       <l n="14">For the country-folk to be up and to arm . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="15">Then he said , “ Good night ! ” and with muffled oar</l>
       <l n="16">Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore ,</l>
       <l n="17">Just as the moon rose over the bay ,</l>
       <l n="18">Where swinging wide at her moorings lay</l>
       <l n="19">The Somerset , British man-of-war ;</l>
       <l n="20">A phantom ship , with each mast and spar</l>
       <l n="21">Across the moon like a prison bar ,</l>
       <l n="22">And a huge black hulk , that was magnified</l>
       <l n="23">By its own reflection in the tide .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="24">Meanwhile , his friend , through alley and street ,</l>
       <l n="25">Wanders and watches with eager ears ,</l>
       <l n="26">Till in the silence around him he hears</l>
       <l n="27">The muster of men at the barrack door ,</l>
       <l n="28">The sound of arms , and the tramp of feet ,</l>
       <l n="29">And the measured tread of the grenadiers ,</l>
       <l n="30">Marching down to their boats on the shore .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="31">Then he climbed to the tower of the church ,</l>
       <l n="32">Up the wooden stairs , with stealthy tread ,</l>
       <l n="33">To the belfry-chamber overhead ,</l>
       <l n="34">And startled the pigeons from their perch</l>
       <l n="35">On the sombre rafters , that round him made</l>
       <l n="36">Masses and moving shapes of shade ,—</l>
       <l n="37">Up the trembling ladder , steep and tall ,</l>
       <l n="38">To the highest window in the wall ,</l>
       <l n="39">Where he paused to listen and look down</l>
       <l n="40">A moment on the roofs of the town ,</l>
       <l n="41">And the moonlight flowing over all .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="42">Beneath , in the churchyard , lay the dead ,</l>
       <l n="43">In their night-encampment on the hill ,</l>
       <l n="44">Wrapped in silence so deep and still</l>
       <l n="45">That he could hear , like a sentinel 's tread ,</l>
       <l n="46">The watchful night-wind , as it went</l>
       <l n="47">Creeping along from tent to tent ,</l>
       <l n="48">And seeming to whisper , “ All is well ! ”</l>
       <l n="49">A moment only he feels the spell</l>
       <l n="50">Of the place and the hour , and the secret dread</l>
       <l n="51">Of the lonely belfry and the dead ;</l>
       <l n="52">For suddenly all his thoughts are bent</l>
       <l n="53">On a shadowy something far away ,</l>
       <l n="54">Where the river widens to meet the bay ,—</l>
       <l n="55">A line of black that bends and floats</l>
       <l n="56">On the rising tide , like a bridge of boats .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="57">Meanwhile , impatient to mount and ride ,</l>
       <l n="58">Booted and spurred , with a heavy stride</l>
       <l n="59">On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere .</l>
       <l n="60">Now he patted his horse 's side ,</l>
       <l n="61">Now gazed at the landscape far and near ,</l>
       <l n="62">Then , impetuous , stamped the earth ,</l>
       <l n="63">And turned and tightened his saddle-girth ;</l>
       <l n="64">But mostly he watched with eager search</l>
       <l n="65">The belfry-tower of the Old North Church ,</l>
       <l n="66">As it rose above the graves on the hill ,</l>
       <l n="67">Lonely and spectral and sombre and still .</l>
       <l n="68">And lo ! as he looks , on the belfry 's height</l>
       <l n="69">A glimmer , and then a gleam of light !</l>
       <l n="70">He springs to the saddle , the bridle he turns ,</l>
       <l n="71">But lingers and gazes , till full on his sight</l>
       <l n="72">A second lamp in the belfry burns !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="73">A hurry of hoofs in a village street ,</l>
       <l n="74">A shape in the moonlight , a bulk in the dark ,</l>
       <l n="75">And beneath , from the pebbles , in passing , a spark</l>
       <l n="76">Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet ;</l>
       <l n="77">That was all ! And yet , through the gloom and the light ,</l>
       <l n="78">The fate of a nation was riding that night ;</l>
       <l n="79">And the spark struck out by that steed , in his flight ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="81">He has left the village and mounted the steep ,</l>

       <l n="83">Is the Mystic , meeting the ocean tides ;</l>
       <l n="84">And under the alders , that skirt its edge ,</l>
       <l n="85">Now soft on the sand , now loud on the ledge ,</l>
       <l n="86">Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides .</l>

       <l n="90">And the barking of the farmer 's dog ,</l>

       <l n="97">And the meeting-house windows , blank and bare ,</l>
       <l n="98">Gaze at him with a spectral glare ,</l>
       <l n="99">As if they already stood aghast</l>

       <l n="104">And the twitter of birds among the trees ,</l>
       <l n="105">And felt the breath of the morning breeze</l>
       <l n="106">Blowing over the meadows brown .</l>
       <l n="107">And one was safe and asleep in his bed</l>

       <l n="44">The words that rouse , the voice that charms .</l>
       <l n="45">The Landlord 's tale was one of arms ,</l>
       <l n="46">Only a tale of love is mine ,</l>
       <l n="47">Blending the human and divine ,</l>
       <l n="48">A tale of the Decameron , told</l>
       <l n="49">In Palmieri 's garden old ,</l>
       <l n="50">By Fiametta , laurel-crowned ,</l>
       <l n="51">While her companions lay around ,</l>
       <l n="52">And heard the intermingled sound</l>
       <l n="53">Of airs that on their errands sped ,</l>
       <l n="54">And wild birds gossiping overhead ,</l>
       <l n="55">And lisp of leaves , and fountain 's fall ,</l>
       <l n="56">And her own voice more sweet than all ,</l>
       <l n="57">Telling the tale , which , wanting these ,</l>
       <l n="58">Perchance may lose its power to please . ”</l>

      <head>THE STUDENT 'S TALE .</head>
      <head>THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">One summer morning , when the sun was hot ,</l>
       <l n="2">Weary with labor in his garden-plot ,</l>
       <l n="3">On a rude bench beneath his cottage eaves ,</l>
       <l n="4">Ser Federigo sat among the leaves</l>
       <l n="5">Of a huge vine , that , with its arms outspread ,</l>
       <l n="6">Hung its delicious clusters overhead .</l>
       <l n="7">Below him , through the lovely valley , flowed</l>
       <l n="8">The river Arno , like a winding road ,</l>
       <l n="9">And from its banks were lifted high in air</l>
       <l n="10">The spires and roofs of Florence called the Fair :</l>
       <l n="11">To him a marble tomb , that rose above</l>
       <l n="12">His wasted fortunes and his buried love .</l>
       <l n="13">For there , in banquet and in tournament ,</l>
       <l n="14">His wealth had lavished been , his substance spent ,</l>
       <l n="15">To woo and lose , since ill his wooing sped ,</l>
       <l n="16">Monna Giovanna , who his rival wed ,</l>
       <l n="17">Yet ever in his fancy reigned supreme ,</l>
       <l n="18">The ideal woman of a young man 's dream .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="19">Then he withdrew , in poverty and pain ,</l>
       <l n="20">To this small farm , the last of his domain ,</l>
       <l n="21">His only comfort and his only care</l>
       <l n="22">To prune his vines , and plant the fig and pear ;</l>
       <l n="23">His only forester and only guest</l>
       <l n="24">His falcon , faithful to him , when the rest ,</l>
       <l n="25">Whose willing hands had found so light of yore</l>
       <l n="26">The brazen knocker of his palace door .</l>
       <l n="27">Had now no strength to lift the wooden latch ,</l>
       <l n="28">That entrance gave beneath a roof of thatch .</l>
       <l n="29">Companion of his solitary ways ,</l>
       <l n="30">Purveyor of his feasts on holidays ,</l>
       <l n="31">On him this melancholy man bestowed</l>
       <l n="32">The love with which his nature overflowed .</l>
       <l n="33">And so the empty-handed years went round ,</l>
       <l n="34">Vacant , though voiceful with prophetic sound ,</l>
       <l n="35">And so , that summer morn , he sat and mused</l>
       <l n="36">With folded , patient hands , as he was used ,</l>
       <l n="37">And dreamily before his half-closed sight</l>
       <l n="38">Floated the vision of his lost delight .</l>
       <l n="39">Beside him , motionless , the drowsy bird</l>
       <l n="40">Dreamed of the chase , and in his slumber heard</l>
       <l n="41">The sudden , scythe-like sweep of wings , that dare</l>
       <l n="42">The headlong plunge thro ’ eddying gulfs of air ,</l>
       <l n="43">Then , starting broad awake upon his perch ,</l>
       <l n="44">Tinkled his bells , like mass-bells in a church ,</l>
       <l n="45">And , looking at his master , seemed to say ,</l>
       <l n="46">“ Ser Federigo , shall we hunt to-day ? ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="47">Ser Federigo thought not of the chase ;</l>
       <l n="48">The tender vision of her lovely face ,</l>
       <l n="49">I will not say he seems to see , he sees</l>
       <l n="50">In the leaf-shadows of the trellises ,</l>
       <l n="51">Herself , yet not herself ; a lovely child</l>
       <l n="52">With flowing tresses , and eyes wide and wild ,</l>
       <l n="53">Coming undaunted up the garden walk ,</l>
       <l n="54">And looking not at him , but at the hawk .</l>
       <l n="55">“ Beautiful falcon ! ” said he , “ would that I</l>
       <l n="56">Might hold thee on my wrist , or see thee fly ! ”</l>
       <l n="57">The voice was hers , and made strange echoes start</l>
       <l n="58">Through all the haunted chambers of his heart ,</l>
       <l n="59">As an æolian harp through gusty doors</l>
       <l n="60">Of some old ruin its wild music pours .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="61">“ Who is thy mother , my fair boy ? ” he said ,</l>
       <l n="62">His hand laid softly on that shining head .</l>
       <l n="63">“ Monna Giovanna .— Will you let me stay</l>
       <l n="64">A little while , and with your falcon play ?</l>
       <l n="65">We live there , just beyond your garden wall ,</l>
       <l n="66">In the great house behind the poplars tall . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="67">So he spake on ; and Federigo heard</l>
       <l n="68">As from afar each softly uttered word ,</l>
       <l n="69">And drifted onward through the golden gleams</l>
       <l n="70">And shadows of the misty sea of dreams ,</l>
       <l n="71">As mariners becalmed through vapors drift ,</l>
       <l n="72">And feel the sea beneath them sink and lift ,</l>
       <l n="73">And hear far off the mournful breakers roar ,</l>
       <l n="74">And voices calling faintly from the shore !</l>
       <l n="75">Then , waking from his pleasant reveries ,</l>
       <l n="76">He took the little boy upon his knees ,</l>
       <l n="77">And told him stories of his gallant bird ,</l>
       <l n="78">Till in their friendship he became a third .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="79">Monna Giovanna , widowed in her prime ,</l>
       <l n="80">Had come with friends to pass the summer time</l>
       <l n="81">In her grand villa , half-way up the hill ,</l>
       <l n="82">O'erlooking Florence , but retired and still ;</l>
       <l n="83">With iron gates , that opened through long lines</l>
       <l n="84">Of sacred ilex and centennial pines ,</l>
       <l n="85">And terraced gardens , and broad steps of stone ,</l>
       <l n="86">And sylvan deities , with moss o'ergrown ,</l>
       <l n="87">And fountains palpitating in the heat ,</l>
       <l n="88">And all Val d'Arno stretched beneath its feet .</l>
       <l n="89">Here in seclusion , as a widow may ,</l>
       <l n="90">The lovely lady whiled the hours away ,</l>
       <l n="91">Pacing in sable robes the statued hall ,</l>
       <l n="92">Herself the stateliest statue among all ,</l>
       <l n="93">And seeing more and more , with secret joy ,</l>
       <l n="94">Her husband risen and living in her boy ,</l>
       <l n="95">Till the lost sense of life returned again ,</l>
       <l n="96">Not as delight , but as relief from pain .</l>
       <l n="97">Meanwhile the boy , rejoicing in his strength ,</l>
       <l n="98">Stormed down the terraces from length to length ;</l>
       <l n="99">The screaming peacock chased in hot pursuit ,</l>
       <l n="100">And climbed the garden trellises for fruit .</l>
       <l n="101">But his chief pastime was to watch the flight</l>
       <l n="102">Of a gerfalcon , soaring into sight ,</l>
       <l n="103">Beyond the trees that fringed the garden wall ,</l>
       <l n="104">Then downward stooping at some distant call ;</l>
       <l n="105">And as he gazed full often wondered he</l>
       <l n="106">Who might the master of the falcon be ,</l>
       <l n="107">Until that happy morning , when he found</l>
       <l n="108">Master and falcon in the cottage ground .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="109">And now a shadow and a terror fell</l>
       <l n="110">On the great house , as if a passing-bell</l>
       <l n="111">Tolled from the tower , and filled each spacious room</l>
       <l n="112">With secret awe , and preternatural gloom ;</l>
       <l n="113">The petted boy grew ill , and day by day</l>
       <l n="114">Pined with mysterious malady away .</l>
       <l n="115">The mother 's heart would not be comforted ;</l>
       <l n="116">Her darling seemed to her already dead ,</l>
       <l n="117">And often , sitting by the sufferer 's side ,</l>
       <l n="118">“ What can I do to comfort thee ? ” she cried .</l>
       <l n="119">At first the silent lips made no reply ,</l>
       <l n="120">But , moved at length by her importunate cry ,</l>
       <l n="121">“ Give me , ” he answered , with imploring tone ,</l>
       <l n="122">“ Ser Federigo 's falcon for my own ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="123">No answer could the astonished mother make ;</l>
       <l n="124">How could she ask , e'en for her darling 's sake ,</l>
       <l n="125">Such favor at a luckless lover 's hand ,</l>
       <l n="126">Well knowing that to ask was to command ?</l>
       <l n="127">Well knowing , what all falconers confessed ,</l>
       <l n="128">In all the land that falcon was the best ,</l>
       <l n="129">The master 's pride and passion and delight ,</l>
       <l n="130">And the sole pursuivant of this poor knight .</l>
       <l n="131">But yet , for her child 's sake , she could no less</l>
       <l n="132">Than give assent , to soothe his restlessness ,</l>
       <l n="133">So promised , and then promising to keep</l>
       <l n="134">Her promise sacred , saw him fall asleep .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="135">The morrow was a bright September morn ;</l>
       <l n="136">The earth was beautiful as if new-born ;</l>
       <l n="137">There was that nameless splendor everywhere ,</l>
       <l n="138">That wild exhilaration in the air ,</l>
       <l n="139">Which makes the passers in the city street</l>
       <l n="140">Congratulate each other as they meet .</l>
       <l n="141">Two lovely ladies , clothed in cloak and hood ,</l>
       <l n="142">Passed through the garden gate into the wood ,</l>
       <l n="143">Under the lustrous leaves , and through the sheen</l>
       <l n="144">Of dewy sunshine showering down between .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="145">The one , close-hooded , had the attractive grace</l>
       <l n="146">Which sorrow sometimes lends a woman 's face ;</l>
       <l n="147">Her dark eyes moistened with the mists that roll</l>
       <l n="148">From the gulf-stream of passion in the soul ;</l>
       <l n="149">The other with her hood thrown back , her hair</l>
       <l n="150">Making a golden glory in the air ,</l>
       <l n="151">Her cheeks suffused with an auroral blush ,</l>
       <l n="152">Her young heart singing louder than the thrush .</l>
       <l n="153">So walked , that morn , through mingled light and shade ,</l>
       <l n="154">Each by the other 's presence lovelier made ,</l>
       <l n="155">Monna Giovanna and her bosom friend ,</l>
       <l n="156">Intent upon their errand and its end .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="157">They found Ser Federigo at his toil ,</l>
       <l n="158">Like banished Adam , delving in the soil ;</l>
       <l n="159">And when he looked and these fair women spied ,</l>
       <l n="160">The garden suddenly was glorified ;</l>
       <l n="161">His long-lost Eden was restored again ,</l>
       <l n="162">And the strange river winding through the plain</l>
       <l n="163">No longer was the Arno to his eyes ,</l>
       <l n="164">But the Euphrates watering Paradise !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="165">Monna Giovanna raised her stately head ,</l>
       <l n="166">And with fair words of salutation said :</l>
       <l n="167">“ Ser Federigo , we come here as friends ,</l>
       <l n="168">Hoping in this to make some poor amends</l>
       <l n="169">For past unkindness . I who ne'er before</l>
       <l n="170">Would even cross the threshold of your door ,</l>
       <l n="171">I who in happier days such pride maintained ,</l>
       <l n="172">Refused your banquets , and your gifts disdained ,</l>
       <l n="173">This morning come , a self-invited guest ,</l>
       <l n="174">To put your generous nature to the test ,</l>
       <l n="175">And breakfast with you under your own vine . ”</l>
       <l n="176">To which he answered : “ Poor desert of mine ,</l>
       <l n="177">Not your unkindness call it , for if aught</l>
       <l n="178">Is good in me of feeling or of thought ,</l>
       <l n="179">From you it comes , and this last grace outweighs</l>
       <l n="180">All sorrows , all regrets of other days . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="181">And after further compliment and talk ,</l>
       <l n="182">Among the dahlias in the garden walk</l>
       <l n="183">He left his guests ; and to his cottage turned ,</l>
       <l n="184">And as he entered for a moment yearned</l>
       <l n="185">For the lost splendors of the days of old ,</l>
       <l n="186">The ruby glass , the silver and the gold ,</l>
       <l n="187">And felt how piercing is the sting of pride ,</l>
       <l n="188">By want embittered and intensified .</l>
       <l n="189">He looked about him for some means or way</l>
       <l n="190">To keep this unexpected holiday ;</l>
       <l n="191">Searched every cupboard , and then searched again ,</l>
       <l n="192">Summoned the maid , who came , but came in vain ;</l>
       <l n="193">“ The Signor did not hunt to-day , ” she said ,</l>
       <l n="194">“ There 's nothing in the house but wine and bread . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="195">Then suddenly the drowsy falcon shook</l>
       <l n="196">His little bells , with that sagacious look ,</l>
       <l n="197">Which said , as plain as language to the ear ,</l>
       <l n="198">“ If anything is wanting , I am here ! ”</l>
       <l n="199">Yes , everything is wanting , gallant bird !</l>
       <l n="200">The master seized thee without further word ,</l>
       <l n="201">Like thine own lure , he whirled thee round ; ah me !</l>
       <l n="202">The pomp and flutter of brave falconry ,</l>
       <l n="203">The bells , the jesses , the bright scarlet hood ,</l>
       <l n="204">The flight and the pursuit o'er field and wood ,</l>
       <l n="205">All these forevermore are ended now ;</l>
       <l n="206">No longer victor , but the victim thou !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="207">Then on the board a snow-white cloth he spread ,</l>
       <l n="208">Laid on its wooden dish the loaf of bread ,</l>
       <l n="209">Brought purple grapes with autumn sunshine hot ,</l>
       <l n="210">The fragrant peach , the juicy bergamot ;</l>
       <l n="211">Then in the midst a flask of wine he placed ,</l>
       <l n="212">And with autumnal flowers the banquet graced .</l>
       <l n="213">Ser Federigo , would not these suffice</l>
       <l n="214">Without thy falcon stuffed with cloves and spice ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="215">When all was ready , and the courtly dame</l>
       <l n="216">With her companion to the cottage came ,</l>
       <l n="217">Upon Ser Federigo 's brain there fell</l>
       <l n="218">The wild enchantment of a magic spell ;</l>
       <l n="219">The room they entered , mean and low and small ,</l>
       <l n="220">Was changed into a sumptuous banquet-hall ,</l>
       <l n="221">With fanfares by aerial trumpets blown ;</l>
       <l n="222">The rustic chair she sat on was a throne ;</l>
       <l n="223">He ate celestial food , and a divine</l>
       <l n="224">Flavor was given to his country wine ,</l>
       <l n="225">And the poor falcon , fragrant with his spice ,</l>
       <l n="226">A peacock was , or bird of paradise !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="17">
       <l n="227">When the repast was ended , they arose</l>
       <l n="228">And passed again into the garden-close .</l>
       <l n="229">Then said the lady , “ Far too well I know ,</l>
       <l n="230">Remembering still the days of long ago ,</l>
       <l n="231">Though you betray it not , with what surprise</l>
       <l n="232">You see me here in this familiar wise .</l>
       <l n="233">You have no children , and you cannot guess</l>
       <l n="234">What anguish , what unspeakable distress</l>
       <l n="235">A mother feels , whose child is lying ill ,</l>
       <l n="236">Nor how her heart anticipates his will .</l>
       <l n="237">And yet for this , you see me lay aside</l>
       <l n="238">All womanly reserve and check of pride ,</l>
       <l n="239">And ask the thing most precious in your sight ,</l>
       <l n="240">Your falcon , your sole comfort and delight ,</l>
       <l n="241">Which if you find it in your heart to give ,</l>
       <l n="242">My poor , unhappy boy perchance may live . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="18">
       <l n="243">Ser Federigo listens , and replies ,</l>
       <l n="244">With tears of love and pity in his eyes :</l>
       <l n="245">“ Alas , dear lady ! there can be no task</l>
       <l n="246">So sweet to me , as giving when you ask .</l>
       <l n="247">One little hour ago , if I had known</l>
       <l n="248">This wish of yours , it would have been my own .</l>
       <l n="249">But thinking in what manner I could best</l>
       <l n="250">Do honor to the presence of my guest ,</l>
       <l n="251">I deemed that nothing worthier could be</l>
       <l n="252">Than what most dear and precious was to me ,</l>
       <l n="253">And so my gallant falcon breathed his last</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Rabbi Ben Levi , on the Sabbath , read</l>
       <l n="2">A volume of the Law , in which it said ,</l>
       <l n="3">“ No man shall look upon my face and live . ”</l>
       <l n="4">And as he read , he prayed that God would give</l>
       <l n="5">His faithful servant grace with mortal eye</l>
       <l n="6">To look upon His face and yet not die .</l>
      </lg>

       <l n="7">Then fell a sudden shadow on the page</l>
       <l n="8">And , lifting up his eyes , grown dim with age ,</l>
       <l n="9">He saw the Angel of Death before him stand ,</l>
       <l n="10">Holding a naked sword in his right hand .</l>
       <l n="11">Rabbi Ben Levi was a righteous man ,</l>
       <l n="12">Yet through his veins a chill of terror ran .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="13">With trembling voice he said , “ What wilt thou here ? ”</l>
       <l n="14">The angel answered , “ Lo ! the time draws near</l>
       <l n="15">When thou must die ; yet first , by God 's decree ,</l>
       <l n="16">Whate'er thou askest shall be granted thee . ”</l>
       <l n="17">Replied the Rabbi , “ Let these living eyes</l>
       <l n="18">First look upon my place in Paradise . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="19">Then said the Angel , “ Come with me and look . ”</l>
       <l n="20">Rabbi Ben Levi closed the sacred book ,</l>
       <l n="21">And rising , and uplifting his gray head ,</l>
       <l n="22">“ Give me thy sword , ” he to the Angel said ,</l>
       <l n="23">“ Lest thou shouldst fall upon me by the way . ”</l>
       <l n="24">The Angel smiled and hastened to obey ,</l>
       <l n="25">Then led him forth to the Celestial Town ,</l>
       <l n="26">And set him on the wall , whence , gazing down ,</l>
       <l n="27">Rabbi Ben Levi , with his living eyes ,</l>
       <l n="28">Might look upon his place in Paradise .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="29">Then straight into the city of the Lord</l>
       <l n="30">The Rabbi leaped with the Death-Angel 's sword ,</l>
       <l n="31">And through the streets there swept a sudden breath</l>
       <l n="32">Of something there unknown , which men call death .</l>
       <l n="33">Meanwhile the Angel stayed without , and cried ,</l>
       <l n="34">“ Come back ! ” To which the Rabbi 's voice replied ,</l>
       <l n="35">“ No ! in the name of God , whom I adore ,</l>

       <l n="51">He heard the awful mandate of the Lord</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="53">The Rabbi bowed his head in silent prayer ;</l>

       <l n="7">The spiritual world seemed near ;</l>

       <l n="5">On St. John 's eve , at vespers , proudly sat</l>

       <l n="8">Repeated , like a burden or refrain ,</l>

       <l n="7">There dwelt , as from the chronicles we learn ,</l>

       <l n="19">And when he chanced the passing Host to meet ,</l>
       <l n="20">He knelt and prayed devoutly in the street ;</l>
       <l n="21">Oft he confessed ; and with each mutinous thought ,</l>
       <l n="22">As with wild beasts at Ephesus , he fought .</l>
       <l n="23">In deep contrition scourged himself in Lent ,</l>
       <l n="24">Walked in processions , with his head down bent ,</l>
       <l n="25">At plays of Corpus Christi oft was seen ,</l>
       <l n="26">And on Palm Sunday bore his bough of green .</l>
       <l n="27">His only pastime was to hunt the boar</l>
       <l n="28">Through tangled thickets of the forest hoar ,</l>
       <l n="29">Or with his jingling mules to hurry down</l>
       <l n="30">To some grand bull-fight in the neighboring town ,</l>
       <l n="31">Or in the crowd with lighted taper stand ,</l>
       <l n="32">When Jews were burned , or banished from the land .</l>

       <l n="42">When first she came into that gloomy place ,—</l>
       <l n="43">A memory in his heart as dim and sweet</l>
       <l n="44">As moonlight in a solitary street ,</l>

       <l n="64">He watched them from the casement when they walked ,</l>
       <l n="65">He saw the gypsy haunt the river 's side ,</l>
       <l n="66">He saw the monk among the cork-trees glide ;</l>

       <l n="68">Of some dark secret , past his finding out ,</l>
       <l n="69">Baffled he paused ; then reassured again</l>
       <l n="70">Pursued the flying phantom of his brain .</l>
       <l n="71">He watched them even when they knelt in church ;</l>
       <l n="72">And then , descending lower in his search ,</l>
       <l n="73">Questioned the servants , and with eager eyes</l>
       <l n="74">Listened incredulous to their replies ;</l>
       <l n="75">The gypsy ? none had seen her in the wood !</l>
