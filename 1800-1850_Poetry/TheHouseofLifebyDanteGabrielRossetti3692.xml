    <head>INTRODUCTORY SONNET</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A Sonnet is a moment 's monument ,—</l>
     <l n="2">Memorial from the Soul 's eternity</l>
     <l n="3">To one dead deathless hour . Look that it be ,</l>
     <l n="4">Whether for lustral rite or dire portent ,</l>
     <l n="5">Of its own arduous fulness reverent :</l>
     <l n="6">Carve it in ivory or in ebony ,</l>
     <l n="7">As Day or Night may rule ; and let Time see</l>
     <l n="8">Its flowering crest impearled and orient .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">A Sonnet is a coin : its face reveals</l>
     <l n="10">The soul ,— its converse , to what Power ‘ tis due :—</l>
     <l n="11">Whether for tribute to the august appeals</l>
     <l n="12">Of Life , or dower in Love 's high retinue ,</l>
     <l n="13">It serve ; or , ‘ mid the dark wharf 's cavernous breath ,</l>
     <l n="14">In Charon 's palm it pay the toll to Death .</l>

    <head>LOVE ENTHRONED</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I marked all kindred Powers the heart finds fair :—</l>
     <l n="2">Truth , with awed lips ; and Hope , with eyes upcast ;</l>
     <l n="3">And Fame , whose loud wings fan the ashen Past</l>
     <l n="4">To signal-fires , Oblivion 's flight to scare ;</l>
     <l n="5">And Youth , with still some single golden hair</l>
     <l n="6">Unto his shoulder clinging , since the last</l>
     <l n="7">Embrace wherein two sweet arms held him fast ;</l>
     <l n="8">And Life , still wreathing flowers for Death to wear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Love 's throne was not with these ; but far above</l>
     <l n="10">All passionate wind of welcome and farewell</l>
     <l n="11">He sat in breathless bowers they dream not of ;</l>
     <l n="12">Though Truth foreknow Love 's heart , and Hope foretell ,</l>
     <l n="13">And Fame be for Love 's sake desirable ,</l>
     <l n="14">And Youth be dear , and Life be sweet to Love .</l>

    <head>BRIDAL BIRTH</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">As when desire , long darkling , dawns , and first</l>
     <l n="2">The mother looks upon the new-born child ,</l>
     <l n="3">Even so my Lady stood at gaze and smiled</l>
     <l n="4">When her soul knew at length the Love it nursed .</l>
     <l n="5">Born with her life , creature of poignant thirst</l>
     <l n="6">And exquisite hunger , at her heart Love lay</l>
     <l n="7">Quickening in darkness , till a voice that day</l>
     <l n="8">Cried on him , and the bonds of birth were burst .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Now , shielded in his wings , our faces yearn</l>
     <l n="10">Together , as his fullgrown feet now range</l>
     <l n="11">The grove , and his warm hands our couch prepare :</l>
     <l n="12">Till to his song our bodiless souls in turn</l>
     <l n="13">Be born his children , when Death 's nuptial change</l>
     <l n="14">Leaves us for light the halo of his hair .</l>

    <head>REDEMPTION</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">O Thou who at Love 's hour ecstatically</l>
     <l n="2">Unto my lips dost evermore present</l>
     <l n="3">The body and blood of Love in sacrament ;</l>
     <l n="4">Whom I have neared and felt thy breath to be</l>
     <l n="5">The inmost incense of his sanctuary ;</l>
     <l n="6">Who without speech hast owned him , and intent</l>
     <l n="7">Upon his will , thy life with mine hast blent ,</l>
     <l n="8">And murmured o'er the cup , Remember me !—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">O what from thee the grace , for me the prize ,</l>
     <l n="10">And what to Love the glory ,— when the whole</l>
     <l n="11">Of the deep stair thou tread'st to the dim shoal</l>
     <l n="12">And weary water of the place of sighs ,</l>
     <l n="13">And there dost work deliverance , as thine eyes</l>
     <l n="14">Draw up my prisoned spirit to thy soul !</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>LOVESIGHT</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">When do I see thee most , beloved one ?</l>
     <l n="2">When in the light the spirits of mine eyes</l>
     <l n="3">Before thy face , their altar , solemnize</l>
     <l n="4">The worship of that Love through thee made known ?</l>
     <l n="5">Or when in the dusk hours , ( we two alone ,)</l>
     <l n="6">Close-kissed and eloquent of still replies</l>
     <l n="7">Thy twilight-hidden glimmering visage lies ,</l>
     <l n="8">And my soul only sees thy soul its own ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">O love , my love ! if I no more should see</l>
     <l n="10">Thyself , nor on the earth the shadow of thee ,</l>
     <l n="11">Nor image of thine eyes in any spring ,—</l>
     <l n="12">How then should sound upon Life 's darkening slope</l>
     <l n="13">The ground-whirl of the perished leaves of Hope ,</l>
     <l n="14">The wind of Death 's imperishable wing ?</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">By what word 's power , the key of paths untrod ,</l>
     <l n="2">Shall I the difficult deeps of Love explore ,</l>
     <l n="3">Till parted waves of Song yield up the shore</l>
     <l n="4">Even as that sea which Israel crossed dry-shod ?</l>
     <l n="5">For lo ! in some poor rhythmic period ,</l>
     <l n="6">Lady , I fain would tell how evermore</l>
     <l n="7">Thy soul I know not from thy body , nor</l>
     <l n="8">Thee from myself , neither our love from God .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Yea , in God 's name , and Love 's , and thine , would I</l>
     <l n="10">Draw from one loving heart such evidence</l>
     <l n="11">As to all hearts all things shall signify ;</l>
     <l n="12">Tender as dawn 's first hill-fire , and intense</l>
     <l n="13">As instantaneous penetrating sense ,</l>
     <l n="14">In Spring 's birth-hour , of other Springs gone by .</l>

     <l n="1">What smouldering senses in death 's sick delay</l>
     <l n="2">Or seizure of malign vicissitude</l>
     <l n="3">Can rob this body of honour , or denude</l>
     <l n="4">This soul of wedding-raiment worn to-day ?</l>
     <l n="5">For lo ! even now my lady 's lips did play</l>
     <l n="6">With these my lips such consonant interlude</l>
     <l n="7">As laurelled Orpheus longed for when he wooed</l>
     <l n="8">The half-drawn hungering face with that last lay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">I was a child beneath her touch ,— a man</l>

     <l n="12">A god when all our life-breath met to fan</l>

    <head>NUPTIAL SLEEP</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">At length their long kiss severed , with sweet smart :</l>
     <l n="2">And as the last slow sudden drops are shed</l>
     <l n="3">From sparkling eaves when all the storm has fled ,</l>
     <l n="4">So singly flagged the pulses of each heart .</l>
     <l n="5">Their bosoms sundered , with the opening start</l>
     <l n="6">Of married flowers to either side outspread</l>
     <l n="7">From the knit stem ; yet still their mouths , burnt red ,</l>
     <l n="8">Fawned on each other where they lay apart .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Sleep sank them lower than the tide of dreams ,</l>
     <l n="10">And their dreams watched them sink , and slid away .</l>
     <l n="11">Slowly their souls swam up again , through gleams</l>
     <l n="12">Of watered light and dull drowned waifs of day ;</l>
     <l n="13">Till from some wonder of new woods and streams</l>
     <l n="14">He woke , and wondered more : for there she lay .</l>

     <l n="2">Along the love-sown fallowfield of sleep</l>
     <l n="3">My lady lies apparent ; and the deep</l>
     <l n="4">Calls to the deep ; and no man sees but I .</l>
     <l n="5">The bliss so long afar , at length so nigh ,</l>
     <l n="6">Rests there attained . Methinks proud Love must weep</l>
     <l n="7">When Fate 's control doth from his harvest reap</l>
     <l n="8">The sacred hour for which the years did sigh .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">First touched , the hand now warm around my neck</l>
     <l n="10">Taught memory long to mock desire : and lo !</l>
     <l n="11">Across my breast the abandoned hair doth flow ,</l>
     <l n="12">Where one shorn tress long stirred the longing ache :</l>
     <l n="13">And next the heart that trembled for its sake</l>
     <l n="14">Lies the queen-heart in sovereign overthrow .</l>

     <l n="5">Do love to deem the silver praise their own ;</l>
     <l n="6">Some prize his blindfold sight ; and there be they</l>
