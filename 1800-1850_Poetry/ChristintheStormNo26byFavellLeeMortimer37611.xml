   <p>CHRIST IN THE STORM .</p>
   <p>There are a great many troubles in this life . Ask your father and your mother whether this is true . Your father will say , “ I have had a great many troubles ; I have found it hard to get bread for my children . ” Your mother will say , “ I have had a great deal of sorrow in bringing up my little family . ”</p>
   <p>My dear child , have you had any troubles ? I am sure you have had some . Have you ever felt great pain ? have you lost a little baby brother or sister ? have you got into disgrace ? have you been punished for your faults ?</p>
   <p>There is one friend to whom every one may go in every trouble . It is Jesus , the Son of God . When we are unhappy , if we cry unto him , he will hear us and help us . Once he lived down upon this earth , and was a man . Now he is in heaven , and he is a man still as well as God .</p>
   <p>I will tell you how he helped some of his friends out of trouble when he lived in this world . His friends were called disciples . One evening they went into a ship . Jesus did not go with them ; he stayed where he was , and spent the night all alone on the top of a mountain , praying to his Father . God was his Father . The disciples were in their little ship on the water when the wind began to blow very hard indeed . The waves rose high , and the ship was tossed about . Every moment the poor men were afraid that the water would fill their ship , and that they should sink to the bottom of the sea .</p>
   <p>All night long the disciples were in sad distress , trying with all their might to row their ship to land , but all they could do was of no use . At last they saw a man walking on the sea . There he was in the midst of the great waves , walking as on the dry land . He went faster than the ship , and seemed as if he would pass by it . The disciples did not know who it was . They thought it could not be a man with a body like ours ; they supposed it was a spirit , who has no body . They were very much frightened , and they cried out in their trouble . Then they heard a voice saying , “ It is I , be not afraid . ” Whose voice was that ? You know , and they knew ; it was the voice of Jesus . Though the winds were whistling and the waves roaring , his voice could be heard .</p>
   <p>One of the disciples , named Peter , said , “ Lord , if it be thou , bid me come unto thee on the water . ” Jesus said , “ Come . ” So Peter got out of the ship and walked on the water to go to Jesus . He believed that Jesus could help him to walk on the water , and Jesus did help him . But when Peter saw how high the wind was , he began to be afraid . This was wrong . He ought to have trusted in Jesus . Soon he felt that he was sinking , and he cried out , “ Lord , save me . ” Jesus heard that short prayer ; he was very near , and he stretched out his hand , and caught hold of Peter .</p>
   <p>Trusting in God is called faith . Peter had a little faith , but not much . So he was able to walk on the water a little way , but not far . Jesus went into the ship and took Peter with him , and as soon as he was there the wind left off blowing . Then all the disciples came round him and worshipped him , saying , “ Truly thou art the Son of God . ”</p>
   <p>It is this Jesus who can help you in your troubles . Will you trust him ? Do not be like Peter , and only trust him a little while , but go on trusting in him , and you will find that he will keep you safe , and make you happy . He forgives sins , which no one else can do , because he died upon the cross to save us from our sins . When we are dying he will not leave us if we trust in him , but he will comfort us and take us to heaven .</p>
   <p>This history you will find in Matt . xiv . 22 — 33 ; Mark vi . 45 — 52 .</p>

   <note>Macintosh , Printer , Great New-street , London . PRAYER . O Father in Heaven , Thou hast made all things ; The sun , moon , and stars , the land and sea . Thou hast made me . Thou hast taken care of me . I thank Thee for all thy kindness . Great God , Thou art in every place ; Thou seest in the dark , As well as in the light ; Thou knowest all the naughty things That I have done , and said , and thought . O Merciful Lord , pardon my sins , Because Jesus Christ , thy dear Son , Died upon the cross for sinners . Give me thy Holy Spirit , That I may love Thee , and obey thy laws . Keep me from minding Satan , And save me from going to hell : And whenever I die , O take my soul to Heaven . When Jesus comes with clouds , And with the holy angels , May I be glad to see Him . May my dear parents , and brothers , and sisters , Be happy with Thee for ever and ever . May all people love Thee , And speak of thy goodness . Hear me for Christ 's sake . Amen .</note>
