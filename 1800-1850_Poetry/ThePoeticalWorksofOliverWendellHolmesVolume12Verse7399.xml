     <l n="1">Nescit vox missa reverti .— Horat . Ars Poetica .</l>
     <l n="2">Ab lis qua non adjuvant quam mollissime oportet pedem referre .—</l>
     <l n="3">Quintillian , L. VI . C. 4 .</l>

   <p>These verses have always been printed in my collected poems , and as the best of them may bear a single reading , I allow them to appear , but in a less conspicuous position than the other productions . A chick , before his shell is off his back , is hardly a fair subject for severe criticism . If one has written anything worth preserving , his first efforts may be objects of interest and curiosity . Other young authors may take encouragement from seeing how tame , how feeble , how commonplace were the rudimentary attempts of the half-fledged poet . If the boy or youth had anything in him , there will probably be some sign of it in the midst of his imitative mediocrities and ambitious failures . These “ first verses ” of mine , written before I was sixteen , have little beyond a common academy boy 's ordinary performance . Yet a kindly critic said there was one line which showed a poetical quality :—</p>
   <p>“ The boiling ocean trembled into calm . ”</p>
   <p>One of these poems — the reader may guess which — won fair words from Thackeray . The Spectre Pig was a wicked suggestion which came into my head after reading Dana 's Buccaneer . Nobody seemed to find it out , and I never mentioned it to the venerable poet , who might not have been pleased with the parody . This is enough to say of these unvalued copies of verses .</p>

    <head>TRANSLATION FROM THE ENEID , BOOK I .</head>
     <l n="1">THE god looked out upon the troubled deep</l>
     <l n="2">Waked into tumult from its placid sleep ;</l>
     <l n="3">The flame of anger kindles in his eye</l>
     <l n="4">As the wild waves ascend the lowering sky ;</l>
     <l n="5">He lifts his head above their awful height</l>
     <l n="6">And to the distant fleet directs his sight ,</l>
     <l n="7">Now borne aloft upon the billow 's crest ,</l>
     <l n="8">Struck by the bolt or by the winds oppressed ,</l>
     <l n="9">And well he knew that Juno 's vengeful ire</l>
     <l n="10">Frowned from those clouds and sparkled in that fire .</l>
     <l n="11">On rapid pinions as they whistled by</l>
     <l n="12">He calls swift Zephyrus and Eurus nigh</l>
     <l n="13">Is this your glory in a noble line</l>
     <l n="14">To leave your confines and to ravage mine ?</l>
     <l n="15">Whom I — but let these troubled waves subside —</l>
     <l n="16">Another tempest and I 'll quell your pride !</l>
     <l n="17">Go — bear our message to your master 's ear ,</l>
     <l n="18">That wide as ocean I am despot here ;</l>
     <l n="19">Let him sit monarch in his barren caves ,</l>
     <l n="20">I wield the trident and control the waves</l>
     <l n="21">He said , and as the gathered vapors break</l>
     <l n="22">The swelling ocean seemed a peaceful lake ;</l>
     <l n="23">To lift their ships the graceful nymphs essayed</l>
     <l n="24">And the strong trident lent its powerful aid ;</l>
     <l n="25">The dangerous banks are sunk beneath the main ,</l>
     <l n="26">And the light chariot skims the unruffled plain .</l>
     <l n="27">As when sedition fires the public mind ,</l>
     <l n="28">And maddening fury leads the rabble blind ,</l>
     <l n="29">The blazing torch lights up the dread alarm ,</l>
     <l n="30">Rage points the steel and fury nerves the arm ,</l>
     <l n="31">Then , if some reverend Sage appear in sight ,</l>
     <l n="32">They stand — they gaze , and check their headlong flight ,—</l>
     <l n="33">He turns the current of each wandering breast</l>
     <l n="34">And hushes every passion into rest ,—</l>
     <l n="35">Thus by the power of his imperial arm</l>
     <l n="36">The boiling ocean trembled into calm ;</l>
     <l n="37">With flowing reins the father sped his way</l>
     <l n="38">And smiled serene upon rekindled day .</l>

    <head>THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS</head>
    <head>Written after a general pruning of the trees around Harvard College . A little poem , on a similar occasion , may be found in the works of Swift , from which , perhaps , the idea was borrowed ; although I was as much surprised as amused to meet with it some time after writing the following lines .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">IT was not many centuries since ,</l>
     <l n="2">When , gathered on the moonlit green ,</l>
     <l n="3">Beneath the Tree of Liberty ,</l>
     <l n="4">A ring of weeping sprites was seen .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The freshman 's lamp had long been dim ,</l>
     <l n="6">The voice of busy day was mute ,</l>
     <l n="7">And tortured Melody had ceased</l>
     <l n="8">Her sufferings on the evening flute .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">They met not as they once had met ,</l>
     <l n="10">To laugh o'er many a jocund tale</l>
     <l n="11">But every pulse was beating low ,</l>
     <l n="12">And every cheek was cold and pale .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">There rose a fair but faded one ,</l>
     <l n="14">Who oft had cheered them with her song ;</l>
     <l n="15">She waved a mutilated arm ,</l>
     <l n="16">And silence held the listening throng .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">“ Sweet friends , ” the gentle nymph began ,</l>
     <l n="18">“ From opening bud to withering leaf ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">“ While all around has felt decay ,</l>
     <l n="22">We rose in ever-living prime ,</l>
     <l n="23">With broader shade and fresher green ,</l>
     <l n="24">Beneath the crumbling step of Time .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">“ When often by our feet has past</l>
     <l n="26">Some biped , Nature 's walking whim ,</l>
     <l n="27">Say , have we trimmed one awkward shape ,</l>
     <l n="28">Or lopped away one crooked limb ?</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="29">“ Go on , fair Science ; soon to thee</l>

     <l n="31">Her vulgar fingers formed a tree ,</l>
     <l n="32">But thou halt trained it to a post .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">“ Go , paint the birch 's silver rind ,</l>
     <l n="34">And quilt the peach with softer down ;</l>
     <l n="35">Up with the willow 's trailing threads ,</l>
     <l n="36">Off with the sunflower 's radiant crown !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">“ Go , plant the lily on the shore ,</l>
     <l n="38">And set the rose among the waves ,</l>
     <l n="39">And bid the tropic bud unbind</l>
     <l n="40">Its silken zone in arctic caves ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">“ Bring bellows for the panting winds ,</l>
     <l n="42">Hang up a lantern by the moon ,</l>
     <l n="43">And give the nightingale a fife ,</l>
     <l n="44">And lend the eagle a balloon !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="45">“ I cannot smile ,— the tide of scorn ,</l>

     <l n="48">Back to its burning source again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="49">“ Again in every quivering leaf</l>
     <l n="50">That moment 's agony I feel ,</l>
     <l n="51">When limbs , that spurned the northern blast ,</l>
     <l n="52">Shrunk from the sacrilegious steel .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="53">“ A curse upon the wretch who dared</l>
     <l n="54">To crop us with his felon saw !</l>

     <l n="56">Lie like a bullet in his maw .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="57">“ In every julep that he drinks ,</l>

     <l n="65">“ On him may never shadow fall ,</l>

     <l n="68">To hang him on my highest bough ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="69">She spoke ;— the morning 's herald beam</l>
     <l n="70">Sprang from the bosom of the sea ,</l>
     <l n="71">And every mangled sprite returned</l>
     <l n="72">In sadness to her wounded tree .</l>

    <head>THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">THERE was a sound of hurrying feet ,</l>
     <l n="2">A tramp on echoing stairs ,</l>
     <l n="3">There was a rush along the aisles ,—</l>
     <l n="4">It was the hour of prayers .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">And on , like Ocean 's midnight wave ,</l>
     <l n="6">The current rolled along ,</l>
     <l n="7">When , suddenly , a stranger form</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">He was a dark and swarthy man ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">There was not one among them all</l>

     <l n="17">All silent as the sheeted dead ,</l>
     <l n="18">In spite of sneer and frown ,</l>
     <l n="19">Fast by a gray-haired senior 's side</l>
     <l n="20">He sat him boldly down .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">There was a look of horror flashed</l>
     <l n="22">From out the tutor 's eyes ;</l>

     <l n="24">The stranger did not rise !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">A murmur broke along the crowd ,</l>

     <l n="27">With ringing heels and measured tread ,</l>
     <l n="28">A hundred forms descend .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">Through sounding aisle , o'er grating stair ,</l>
     <l n="30">The long procession poured ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">That fearful stranger ! down he sat ,</l>
     <l n="34">Unasked , yet undismayed ;</l>

     <l n="36">Of scorn or pleasure played .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">He took his hat and hung it up ,</l>
     <l n="38">With slow but earnest air ;</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">Then from his nearest neighbor 's side</l>
     <l n="42">A knife and plate he drew ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="45">How fled the sugar from the bowl</l>

     <l n="49">A long , long draught ,— an outstretched hand ,—</l>

     <l n="57">A whisper trembled through the crowd ,</l>

     <l n="1">IT was a tall young oysterman lived by the river-side ,</l>
     <l n="2">His shop was just upon the bank , his boat was on the tide ;</l>
     <l n="3">The daughter of a fisherman , that was so straight and slim ,</l>

     <l n="9">Then up arose the oysterman , and to himself said he ,</l>

     <l n="11">I read it in the story-book , that , for to kiss his dear ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">And he has leaped into the waves , and crossed the shining stream ,</l>
     <l n="14">And he has clambered up the bank , all in the moonlight gleam ;</l>
     <l n="15">Oh there were kisses sweet as dew , and words as soft as rain ,—</l>
     <l n="16">But they have heard her father 's step , and in he leaps again !</l>

     <l n="19">“ And what is that , pray tell me , love , that paddles off so fast ? ”</l>

     <l n="23">Down fell that pretty innocent , as falls a snow-white lamb ,</l>

     <l n="25">Alas for those two loving ones ! she waked not from her swound ,</l>

     <l n="27">But Fate has metamorphosed them , in pity of their woe ,</l>

    <p n="2">“ Here lies buried in a Stone Grave 10 feet deep , Cap ’ DANIEL MALCOLM Merch ’ Who departed this Life October 23d , 1769 , Aged 44 years , a true son of Liberty , a Friend to the Publick , an Enemy to oppression , and one of the foremost in opposing the Revenue Acts on America . ”</p>
