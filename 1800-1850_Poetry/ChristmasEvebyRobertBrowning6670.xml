    <head>I</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Out of the little chapel I burst</l>
     <l n="2">Into the fresh night-air again .</l>
     <l n="3">Five minutes full , I waited first</l>
     <l n="4">In the doorway , to escape the rain</l>
     <l n="5">That drove in gusts down the common 's centre</l>
     <l n="6">At the edge of which the chapel stands ,</l>
     <l n="7">Before I plucked up heart to enter .</l>
     <l n="8">Heaven knows how many sorts of hands</l>
     <l n="9">Reached past me , groping for the latch</l>
     <l n="10">Of the inner door that hung on catch</l>
     <l n="11">More obstinate the more they fumbled ,</l>
     <l n="12">Till , giving way at last with a scold</l>
     <l n="13">Of the crazy hinge , in squeezed or tumbled</l>
     <l n="14">One sheep more to the rest in fold ,</l>
     <l n="15">And left me irresolute , standing sentry</l>
     <l n="16">In the sheepfold 's lath-and-plaster entry ,</l>
     <l n="17">Six feet long by three feet wide ,</l>
     <l n="18">Partitioned off from the vast inside —</l>
     <l n="19">I blocked up half of it at least .</l>
     <l n="20">No remedy ; the rain kept driving .</l>
     <l n="21">They eyed me much as some wild beast ,</l>
     <l n="22">That congregation , still arriving ,</l>
     <l n="23">Some of them by the main road , white</l>
     <l n="24">A long way past me into the night ,</l>
     <l n="25">Skirting the common , then diverging ;</l>
     <l n="26">Not a few suddenly emerging</l>
     <l n="27">From the common 's self thro ’ the paling-gaps</l>
     <l n="28">— They house in the gravel-pits perhaps ,</l>
     <l n="29">Where the road stops short with its safeguard border</l>
     <l n="30">Of lamps , as tired of such disorder ;—</l>
     <l n="31">But the most turned in yet more abruptly</l>
     <l n="32">From a certain squalid knot of alleys ,</l>
     <l n="33">Where the town 's bad blood once slept corruptly ,</l>
     <l n="34">Which now the little chapel rallies</l>
     <l n="35">And leads into day again ,— its priestliness</l>
     <l n="36">Lending itself to hide their beastliness</l>
     <l n="37">So cleverly ( thanks in part to the mason ) ,</l>
     <l n="38">And putting so cheery a whitewashed face on</l>
     <l n="39">Those neophytes too much in lack of it ,</l>
     <l n="40">That , where you cross the common as I did ,</l>
     <l n="41">And meet the party thus presided ,</l>
     <l n="42">“ Mount Zion ” with Love-lane at the back of it ,</l>
     <l n="43">They front you as little disconcerted</l>
     <l n="44">As , bound for the hills , her fate averted ,</l>
     <l n="45">And her wicked people made to mind him ,</l>
     <l n="46">Lot might have marched with Gomorrah</l>
     <l n="47">behind him .</l>

     <head>II</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="48">Well , from the road , the lanes or the common ,</l>
      <l n="49">In came the flock : the fat weary woman ,</l>
      <l n="50">Panting and bewildered , down-clapping</l>
      <l n="51">Her umbrella with a mighty report ,</l>
      <l n="52">Grounded it by me , wry and flapping ,</l>
      <l n="53">A wreck of whalebones ; then , with snort ,</l>
      <l n="54">Like a startled horse , at the interloper</l>
      <l n="55">( Who humbly knew himself improper ,</l>
      <l n="56">But could not shrink up small enough )</l>
      <l n="57">— Round to the door , and in ,— the gruff</l>
      <l n="58">Hinge 's invariable scold</l>
      <l n="59">Making my very blood run cold .</l>
      <l n="60">Prompt in the wake of her , up-pattered</l>
      <l n="61">On broken clogs , the many-tattered</l>
      <l n="62">Little old-faced peaking sister-turned-mother</l>
      <l n="63">Of the sickly babe she tried to smother</l>
      <l n="64">Somehow up , with its spotted face ,</l>
      <l n="65">From the cold , on her breast , the one warm place ;</l>
      <l n="66">She too must stop , wring the poor ends dry</l>
      <l n="67">Of a draggled shawl , and add thereby</l>
      <l n="68">Her tribute to the door-mat , sopping</l>
      <l n="69">Already from my own clothes ’ dropping ,</l>
      <l n="70">Which yet she seemed to grudge I should stand on :</l>
      <l n="71">Then , stooping down to take off her pattens ,</l>
      <l n="72">She bore them defiantly , in each hand one ,</l>
      <l n="73">Planted together before her breast</l>
      <l n="74">And its babe , as good as a lance in rest .</l>
      <l n="75">Close on her heels , the dingy satins</l>
      <l n="76">Of a female something , past me flitted ,</l>
      <l n="77">With lips as much too white , as a streak</l>
      <l n="78">Lay far too red on each hollow cheek ;</l>
      <l n="79">And it seemed the very door-hinge pitied</l>
      <l n="80">All that was left of a woman once ,</l>
      <l n="81">Holding at least its tongue for the nonce .</l>
      <l n="82">Then a tall yellow man , like the Penitent Thief ,</l>
      <l n="83">With his jaw bound up in a handkerchief ,</l>
      <l n="84">And eyelids screwed together tight ,</l>
      <l n="85">Led himself in by some inner light .</l>
      <l n="86">And , except from him , from each that entered ,</l>
      <l n="87">I got the same interrogation —</l>
      <l n="88">“ What , you the alien , you have ventured</l>
      <l n="89">“ To take with us , the elect , your station ?</l>
      <l n="90">“ A carer for none of it , a Gallio ! ” —</l>
      <l n="91">Thus , plain as print , I read the glance</l>
      <l n="92">At a common prey , in each countenance</l>
      <l n="93">As of huntsman giving his hounds the tallyho .</l>
      <l n="94">And , when the door 's cry drowned their wonder ,</l>
      <l n="95">The draught , it always sent in shutting ,</l>
      <l n="96">Made the flame of the single tallow candle</l>
      <l n="97">In the cracked square lantern I stood under ,</l>
      <l n="98">Shoot its blue lip at me , rebutting</l>
      <l n="99">As it were , the luckless cause of scandal :</l>
      <l n="100">I verily fancied the zealous light</l>
      <l n="101">( In the chapel 's secret , too ! ) for spite</l>
      <l n="102">Would shudder itself clean off the wick ,</l>
      <l n="103">With the airs of a Saint John 's Candlestick .</l>
      <l n="104">[ Footnote : See Rev . i . 20 . ]</l>
      <l n="105">There was no standing it much longer .</l>
      <l n="106">“ Good folks , ” thought I , as resolve grew stronger ,</l>
      <l n="107">“ This way you perform the Grand-Inquisitor</l>
      <l n="108">“ When the weather sends you a chance visitor ?</l>
      <l n="109">“ You are the men , and wisdom shall die with you ,</l>
      <l n="110">“ And none of the old Seven Churches vie with you !</l>
      <l n="111">“ But still , despite the pretty perfection</l>
      <l n="112">“ To which you carry your trick of exclusiveness ,</l>
      <l n="113">“ And , taking God 's word under wise protection ,</l>
      <l n="114">“ Correct its tendency to diffusiveness ,</l>
      <l n="115">“ And bid one reach it over hot ploughshares ,—</l>
      <l n="116">“ Still , as I say , though you 've found salvation ,</l>
      <l n="117">“ If I should choose to cry , as now , ‘ Shares ! ’ —</l>
      <l n="118">“ See if the best of you bars me my ration !</l>
      <l n="119">“ I prefer , if you please , for my expounder</l>
      <l n="120">“ Of the laws of the feast , the feast 's own Founder ;</l>
      <l n="121">“ Mine 's the same right with your poorest and sickliest</l>
      <l n="122">“ Supposing I don the marriage vestiment :</l>
      <l n="123">“ So shut your mouth and open your Testament ,</l>
      <l n="124">“ And carve me my portion at your quickliest ! ”</l>
      <l n="125">Accordingly , as a shoemaker 's lad</l>
      <l n="126">With wizened face in want of soap ,</l>
      <l n="127">And wet apron wound round his waist like a rope ,</l>
      <l n="128">( After stopping outside , for his cough was bad ,</l>
      <l n="129">To get the fit over , poor gentle creature ,</l>
      <l n="130">And so avoid disturbing the preacher )</l>
      <l n="131">— Passed in , I sent my elbow spikewise</l>
      <l n="132">At the shutting door , and entered likewise ,</l>
      <l n="133">Received the hinge 's accustomed greeting ,</l>
      <l n="134">And crossed the threshold 's magic pentacle ,</l>
      <l n="135">And found myself in full conventicle ,</l>
      <l n="136">— To wit , in Zion Chapel Meeting ,</l>
      <l n="137">On the Christmas-Eve of ‘ Forty-nine ,</l>
      <l n="138">Which , calling its flock to their special clover ,</l>
      <l n="139">Found all assembled and one sheep over ,</l>
      <l n="140">Whose lot , as the weather pleased , was mine .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="141">I very soon had enough of it .</l>
      <l n="142">The hot smell and the human noises ,</l>
      <l n="143">And my neighbour 's coat , the greasy cuff of it ,</l>
      <l n="144">Were a pebble-stone that a child 's hand poises ,</l>
      <l n="145">Compared with the pig-of-lead-like pressure</l>
      <l n="146">Of the preaching man 's immense stupidity ,</l>
      <l n="147">As he poured his doctrine forth , full measure ,</l>
      <l n="148">To meet his audience 's avidity .</l>
      <l n="149">You needed not the wit of the Sibyl</l>
      <l n="150">To guess the cause of it all , in a twinkling :</l>
      <l n="151">No sooner our friend had got an inkling</l>
      <l n="152">Of treasure hid in the Holy Bible ,</l>
      <l n="153">( Whene'er ‘ twas the thought first struck him ,</l>
      <l n="154">How death , at unawares , might duck him</l>
      <l n="155">Deeper than the grave , and quench</l>
      <l n="156">The gin-shop 's light in hell 's grim drench )</l>
      <l n="157">Than he handled it so , in fine irreverence ,</l>
      <l n="158">As to hug the book of books to pieces :</l>
      <l n="159">And , a patchwork of chapters and texts in severance ,</l>
      <l n="160">Not improved by the private dog'shYpppHeNears and creases ,</l>
      <l n="161">Having clothed his own soul with , he 'd fain see equipt yours ,—</l>
      <l n="162">So tossed you again your Holy Scriptures .</l>
      <l n="163">And you picked them up , in a sense , no doubt :</l>
      <l n="164">Nay , had but a single face of my neighbours</l>
      <l n="165">Appeared to suspect that the preacher 's labours</l>
      <l n="166">Were help which the world could be saved without ,</l>
      <l n="167">‘ Tis odds but I might have borne in quiet</l>
      <l n="168">A qualm or two at my spiritual diet ,</l>
      <l n="169">Or ( who can tell ? ) perchance even mustered</l>
      <l n="170">Somewhat to urge in behalf of the sermon :</l>
      <l n="171">But the flock sat on , divinely flustered ,</l>
      <l n="172">Sniffing , methought , its dew of Hermon</l>
      <l n="173">With such content in every snuffle ,</l>
      <l n="174">As the devil inside us loves to ruffle .</l>
      <l n="175">My old fat woman purred with pleasure ,</l>
      <l n="176">And thumb round thumb went twirling faster ,</l>
      <l n="177">While she , to his periods keeping measure ,</l>
      <l n="178">Maternally devoured the pastor .</l>
      <l n="179">The man with the handkerchief untied it ,</l>
      <l n="180">Showed us a horrible wen inside it ,</l>
      <l n="181">Gave his eyelids yet another screwing ,</l>
      <l n="182">And rocked himself as the woman was doing .</l>
      <l n="183">The shoemaker 's lad , discreetly choking ,</l>
      <l n="184">Kept down his cough . ‘ Twas too provoking !</l>
      <l n="185">My gorge rose at the nonsense and stuff of it ;</l>
      <l n="186">So , saying like Eve when she plucked the apple ,</l>
      <l n="187">“ I wanted a taste , and now there 's enough of it , ”</l>
      <l n="188">I flung out of the little chapel .</l>

    <lg type="part" n="3">
     <head>IV</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="189">There was a lull in the rain , a lull</l>
      <l n="190">In the wind too ; the moon was risen ,</l>
      <l n="191">And would have shone out pure and full ,</l>
      <l n="192">But for the ramparted cloud-prison ,</l>
      <l n="193">Block on block built up in the West ,</l>
      <l n="194">For what purpose the wind knows best ,</l>
      <l n="195">Who changes his mind continually .</l>
      <l n="196">And the empty other half of the sky</l>
      <l n="197">Seemed in its silence as if it knew</l>
      <l n="198">What , any moment , might look through</l>
      <l n="199">A chance gap in that fortress massy :—</l>
      <l n="200">Through its fissures you got hints</l>
      <l n="201">Of the flying moon , by the shifting tints ,</l>
      <l n="202">Now , a dull lion-colour , now , brassy</l>
      <l n="203">Burning to yellow , and whitest yellow ,</l>
      <l n="204">Like furnace-smoke just ere flames bellow ,</l>
      <l n="205">All a-simmer with intense strain</l>
      <l n="206">To let her through ,— then blank again ,</l>
      <l n="207">At the hope of her appearance failing .</l>
      <l n="208">Just by the chapel , a break in the railing</l>
      <l n="209">Shows a narrow path directly across ;</l>
      <l n="210">‘ Tis ever dry walking there , on the moss —</l>
      <l n="211">Besides , you go gently all the way uphill .</l>
      <l n="212">I stooped under and soon felt better ;</l>
      <l n="213">My head grew lighter , my limbs more supple ,</l>
      <l n="214">As I walked on , glad to have slipt the fetter .</l>
      <l n="215">My mind was full of the scene I had left ,</l>
      <l n="216">That placid flock , that pastor vociferant ,</l>
      <l n="217">— How this outside was pure and different !</l>
      <l n="218">The sermon , now — what a mingled weft</l>
      <l n="219">Of good and ill ! Were either less ,</l>
      <l n="220">Its fellow had coloured the whole distinctly ;</l>
      <l n="221">But alas for the excellent earnestness ,</l>
      <l n="222">And the truths , quite true if stated succinctly ,</l>
      <l n="223">But as surely false , in their quaint presentment ,</l>
      <l n="224">However to pastor and flock 's contentment !</l>
      <l n="225">Say rather , such truths looked false to your eyes ,</l>
      <l n="226">With his provings and parallels twisted and twined ,</l>
      <l n="227">Till how could you know them , grown double their size</l>
      <l n="228">In the natural fog of the good man 's mind ,</l>
      <l n="229">Like yonder spots of our roadside lamps ,</l>
      <l n="230">Haloed about with the common 's damps ?</l>
      <l n="231">Truth remains true , the fault 's in the prover ;</l>
      <l n="232">The zeal was good , and the aspiration ;</l>
      <l n="233">And yet , and yet , yet , fifty times over ,</l>
      <l n="234">Pharaoh received no demonstration ,</l>
      <l n="235">By his Baker 's dream of Basket Three ,</l>
      <l n="236">Of the doctrine of the Trinity ,—</l>
      <l n="237">Although , as our preacher thus embellished it ,</l>
      <l n="238">Apparently his hearers relished it</l>
      <l n="239">With so unfeigned a gust — who knows if</l>
      <l n="240">They did not prefer our friend to Joseph ?</l>
      <l n="241">But so it is everywhere , one way with all of them !</l>
      <l n="242">These people have really felt , no doubt ,</l>
      <l n="243">A something , the motion they style the Call of them ;</l>
      <l n="244">And this is their method of bringing about ,</l>
      <l n="245">By a mechanism of words and tones ,</l>
      <l n="246">( So many texts in so many groans )</l>
      <l n="247">A sort of reviving and reproducing ,</l>
      <l n="248">More or less perfectly , ( who can tell ? )</l>
      <l n="249">The mood itself , which strengthens by using ;</l>
      <l n="250">And how that happens , I understand well .</l>
      <l n="251">A tune was born in my head last week ,</l>
      <l n="252">Out of the thump-thump and shriek-shriek</l>
      <l n="253">Of the train , as I came by it , up from Manchester ;</l>
      <l n="254">And when , next week , I take it back again ,</l>
