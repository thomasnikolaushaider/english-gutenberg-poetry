    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">All through my busy years of prose writing I have occasionally jotted down idle thoughts in rhyme . Imagining ideal scenes , ideal characters , and then , as is the way , I suppose , with more ambitious poets , trying to put myself inside the personalities I have invoked , trying to feel as they would be likely to , speak the words I fancied they would say .</p>
    <p n="2">The many faults of my verses I can see only too well ; their merits , if they have any , I leave with the public — which has always been so kind to me — to discover .</p>
    <p n="3">And half-hopefully , half-fearfully , I send out the little craft on the wide sea strewn with so many wrecks . But thinking it must be safer from adverse winds because it carries so low a sail , and will cruise along so close to the shore and not try to sail out in the deep waters .</p>
    <p n="4">And so I bid the dear little wanderer ( dear to me ) , God-speed , and bon voyage .</p>
    <p n="5">Marietta Holley .</p>

   <head>WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER ?</head>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">It is not the lark 's clear tone</l>
     <l n="3">Cleaving the morning air with a soaring cry ,</l>
     <l n="4">Nor the nightingale 's dulcet melody all the balmy night —</l>
     <l n="5">Not these alone</l>
     <l n="6">Make the sweet sounds of summer ;</l>
     <l n="7">But the drone of beetle and bee , the murmurous hum of the fly</l>
     <l n="8">And the chirp of the cricket hidden out of sight —</l>
     <l n="9">These help to make the summer .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">Not roses redly blown ,</l>
     <l n="11">Nor golden lilies , lighting the dusky meads ,</l>
     <l n="12">Nor proud imperial pansies , nor queen-cups quaint and rare —</l>
     <l n="13">Not these alone</l>
     <l n="14">Make the sweet sights of summer</l>
     <l n="15">But the countless forest leaves , the myriad wayside weeds</l>
     <l n="16">And slender grasses , springing up everywhere —</l>
     <l n="17">These help to make the summer .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="18">One heaven bends above ;</l>
     <l n="19">The lowliest head ofttimes has sweetest rest ;</l>
     <l n="20">O'er songhYpppHeNbird in the pine , and bee in the ivy low ,</l>
     <l n="21">Is the same love , it is all God 's summer ;</l>
     <l n="22">Well pleased is He if we patiently do our best ,</l>
     <l n="23">So hum little bee , and low green grasses grow ,</l>
     <l n="24">You help to make the summer .</l>

    <head>THE BROTHERS .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">High on a rocky cliff did once a gray old castle stand ,</l>
     <l n="2">From whence rough-bearded chieftains led their vassals — ruled</l>
     <l n="3">the land .</l>
     <l n="4">For centuries had dwelt here sire and son , till it befell ,</l>
     <l n="5">Last of their ancient line , two brothers here alone did dwell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">The eldest was stern-visaged , but the youngest smooth and fair</l>
     <l n="7">Of countenance ; both zealous , men who bent the knee in prayer</l>
     <l n="8">To God alone ; loved much , read much His holy word ,</l>
     <l n="9">And prayed above all gifts desired , that they might see</l>
     <l n="10">their Lord .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">For this the elder brother carved a silent cell of stone ,</l>
     <l n="12">And in its deep and dreary depths he entered , dwelt alone ,</l>
     <l n="13">And strove with scourgings , vigils , fasts , to purify his gaze ,</l>
     <l n="14">And sought amidst these shadows to behold the Master 's face .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="15">And from the love of God that smiles on us from bright</l>
     <l n="16">lipped flowers ,</l>
     <l n="17">And from the smile of God that falls in sunlight 's golden showers ,</l>
     <l n="18">That thrills earth 's slumbering heart so , where its warm rays fall</l>
     <l n="19">That it laughs out in beauty , turned he as from tempters all .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="20">From bird-song running morn 's sweet-scented chalice o'er</l>
     <l n="21">with cheer ,</l>
     <l n="22">The child 's light laughter , lifting lowliest souls heaven near ,</l>
     <l n="23">From tears and glad smiles , linked light and gloom of</l>
     <l n="24">the golden day ,</l>
     <l n="25">He counting these temptations all , austerely turned away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="26">And thus he lived alone , unblest , and died unblest , alone ,</l>
     <l n="27">Save for a brother monk , who held the carved cross of stone</l>
     <l n="28">In his cold , rigid clasp , the while his dying eyes did wear</l>
     <l n="29">A look of mortal striving , mortal agony , and prayer .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="30">Though at the very last , as his stiff fingers dropped the cross ,</l>
     <l n="31">A gleam as from some distant city swept his face across ,</l>
     <l n="32">The clay lips settled into calm — thus did the monk attest ,</l>
     <l n="33">A look of one who through much peril enters into rest .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="34">Not thus did he , the younger brother , seek the Master 's face ;</l>
     <l n="35">But in earth 's lowly places did he strive his steps to trace ,</l>
     <l n="36">Wherever want and grief besought with clamorous complaint ,</l>
     <l n="37">There he beheld his Lord — naked , athirst , and faint .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="38">And when his hand was wet with tears , wrung with a grateful grasp ,</l>
     <l n="39">He lightly felt upon his palm the Elder Brother 's clasp ;</l>
     <l n="40">And when above the loathsome couch of woe and want bent he ,</l>
     <l n="41">A low voice thrilled his soul , “ So have ye done it unto Me . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="42">Despised he not the mystic ties of blood , yet did he claim</l>
     <l n="43">The broader , wider brotherhood , with every race and name ;</l>
     <l n="44">To his own kin he kind and loyal was in truth , yet still ,</l>
     <l n="45">His mother and his brethren were all who did God 's will</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="46">All little ones were dear to him , for light from Paradise</l>
     <l n="47">Seemed falling on him through their pure and innocent eyes ;</l>
     <l n="48">The very flowers that fringed cool streams , and gemmed</l>
     <l n="49">the dewy sod ,</l>
     <l n="50">To his rapt vision seemed like the visible smiles of God .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="51">The deep 's full heart that throbs unceasing against the silent</l>
     <l n="52">ships ,</l>
     <l n="53">The waves together murmuring with weird , mysterious lips</l>
     <l n="54">To hear their untranslated psalm , drew down his anointed ear ,</l>
     <l n="55">And listening , lo ! he heard God 's voice , to Him was he so near .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="56">The happy hum of bees to him made summer silence sweet ,</l>
     <l n="57">Not lightly did he view the very grass beneath his feet ,</l>
     <l n="58">It paved His presence-chamber , where he walked a happy guest ,</l>
     <l n="59">Ah ! slight the veil between , in very truth his life was blest .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="60">And when on a still twilight passed he to the summer land ,</l>
     <l n="61">Those whom he had befriended , weeping , clinging to his hand ,</l>
     <l n="62">The west gleamed with a sudden glory , and from out the glow</l>
     <l n="63">Trembled the semblance of a crown , and rested on his brow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="64">And with wide , eager eyes he smiled , and stretched his hands</l>
     <l n="65">abroad ,</l>
     <l n="66">As if his dearest friend were welcoming him to his abode ;</l>
     <l n="67">Eternal silence sealed that wondrous smile as he cried —</l>
     <l n="68">“ Thy face ! Thy face , dear Lord ! ” and , saying this , he died .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="69">But legends tell that on his grave fell such a strange , pure</l>
     <l n="70">light ,</l>
     <l n="71">That wine-red roses planted thereupon would spring up white ,</l>
     <l n="72">Holding such mystic healing in their cool snow bloom , that lain</l>
     <l n="73">On aching brows or sorrowful hearts , they would ease their pain .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>A RICH MAN 'S REVERIE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The years go by , but they little seem</l>
     <l n="2">Like those within our dream ;</l>
     <l n="3">The years that stood in such luring guise ,</l>
     <l n="4">Beckoning us into Paradise ,</l>
     <l n="5">To jailers turn as time goes by</l>
     <l n="6">Guarding that fair land , By-and-By ,</l>
     <l n="7">Where we thought to blissfully rest ,</l>
     <l n="8">The sound of whose forests ’ balmy leaves</l>
     <l n="9">Swaying to dream winds strangely sweet ,</l>
     <l n="10">We heard in our bed ‘ neath the cottage eaves ,</l>
     <l n="11">Whose towers we saw in the western skies</l>
     <l n="12">When with eager eyes and tremulous lip ,</l>
     <l n="13">We watched the silent , silver ship</l>
     <l n="14">Of the crescent moon , sailing out and away</l>
     <l n="15">O'er the land we would reach some day , some day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="16">But years have flown , and our weary feet</l>
     <l n="17">Have never reached that Isle of the Blest ;</l>
     <l n="18">But care we have felt , and an aching breast ,</l>
     <l n="19">A lifelong struggle , grief , unrest ,</l>
     <l n="20">That had no part in our boyish plans ;</l>
     <l n="21">And yet I have gold , and houses , and lands ,</l>
     <l n="22">And ladened vessels a white-winged fleet ,</l>
     <l n="23">That fly at my bidding across the sea ;</l>
     <l n="24">And hats are doffed by willing hands</l>
     <l n="25">As I tread the village street ;</l>
     <l n="26">But wealth and fame are not to me</l>
     <l n="27">What I thought that they would be .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="28">I turn from it all to wander back</l>
     <l n="29">With Memory down the dusty track</l>
     <l n="30">Of the years that lie between ,</l>
     <l n="31">To the farm-house old and brown ,</l>
     <l n="32">Shaded with poplars dusky green ,</l>
     <l n="33">I pause at its gate , not a bearded man ,</l>
     <l n="34">But a boy with earnest eyes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="35">I stand at the gate and look around</l>
     <l n="36">At the fresh , fair world that before me lies .</l>
     <l n="37">The misty mountain-top aglow</l>
     <l n="38">With love of the sun , and the pleasant ground</l>
     <l n="39">Asleep at its feet , with sunny dreams</l>
     <l n="40">Of milk-white flowers in its heart , and clear</l>
     <l n="41">The tall church-spire in the distance gleams</l>
     <l n="42">Pointing up to the tranquil sky 's</l>
     <l n="43">Blue roof that seems so near .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="44">And up from the woods the morning breeze</l>
     <l n="45">Comes freighted with all the rich perfume</l>
     <l n="46">That from myriad spicy cups distils ,</l>
     <l n="47">Loitering along o'er the locust-trees .</l>
     <l n="48">Scattering down the plum-trees ’ bloom</l>
     <l n="49">In flakes of crimson snow —</l>
     <l n="50">Down on the gold of the daffodils</l>
     <l n="51">That border the path below .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="52">And the silver thread of the rivulet</l>
     <l n="53">Tangled and knotted with fern and sedge .</l>
     <l n="54">And the mill-pond like a diamond set</l>
     <l n="55">In the streamlet 's emerald edge ;</l>
     <l n="56">And over the stream on the gradual hill ,</l>
     <l n="57">Its headstones glimmering palely white ,</l>
     <l n="58">Is the graveyard quiet and still .</l>
     <l n="59">I wade through its grasses rank and deep ,</l>
     <l n="60">Past slanting marbles mossy and dim ,</l>
     <l n="61">Carven with lines from some old hymn ,</l>
     <l n="62">To one where my mother used to lean</l>
     <l n="63">On Sunday noons and weep .</l>
     <l n="64">That tall white shape I looked upon</l>
     <l n="65">With a mysterious dread ,</l>
     <l n="66">Linking unto the senseless stone</l>
     <l n="67">The image of the dead —</l>
     <l n="68">The father I never had seen ;</l>
     <l n="69">I remember on dark nights of storm ,</l>
     <l n="70">When our parlor was bright and warm ,</l>
     <l n="71">I would turn away from its glowing light ,</l>
     <l n="72">And look far out in the churchyard dim ,</l>
     <l n="73">And with infinite pity think of him</l>
     <l n="74">Shut out alone in the dismal night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="75">And the ruined mill by the waterfall ,</l>
     <l n="76">I see again its crumbling wall ,</l>
     <l n="77">And I hear the water 's song .</l>
     <l n="78">It all comes back to me —</l>
     <l n="79">Its song comes back to me ,</l>
     <l n="80">Floating out like a spirit 's call</l>
     <l n="81">The drowsy air along ;</l>
     <l n="82">Blending forever with my name</l>
     <l n="83">Wonderful prophecies , dreamy talk ,</l>
     <l n="84">Of future paths when I should walk</l>
     <l n="85">Crowned with manhood , and honor , and fame .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="86">I shut my eyes and the rich perfume</l>
     <l n="87">Of the tropical lily fills the room</l>
     <l n="88">From its censer of frosted snow ;</l>
     <l n="89">But it seems to float to me through the night</l>
     <l n="90">From those apple-blossoms red and white</l>
     <l n="91">That starred the orchard 's fragrant gloom ;</l>
     <l n="92">Those old boughs hanging low ,</l>
     <l n="93">Where my sister 's swing swayed to and fro</l>
     <l n="94">Through the scented aisles of the air ;</l>
     <l n="95">While her merry voice and her laugh rung out</l>

     <l n="6">What should you say if I told you to your face</l>
     <l n="7">Your robes are dyed with as deep a stain as mine ,</l>

     <l n="22">Wealth in coffers and vaults , high station , the family gems ,</l>
     <l n="23">For these you stood at God 's altar and swore to a lie ;</l>

     <l n="45">And since I had the burden of guilt to bear</l>
     <l n="46">It was enough without the wild despair of love ,</l>
