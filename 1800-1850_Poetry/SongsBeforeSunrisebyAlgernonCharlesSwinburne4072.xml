     <l n="4">Blossom or berry or weed .</l>
     <l n="5">Sweet though they be not , or fair ,</l>
     <l n="6">That the dew of your word kept growing ,</l>
     <l n="7">Sweet at least was the seed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">Men bring you love-offerings of tears ,</l>
     <l n="9">And sorrow the kiss that assuages ,</l>
     <l n="10">And slaves the hate-offering of wrongs ,</l>
     <l n="11">And time the thanksgiving of years ,</l>
     <l n="12">And years the thanksgiving of ages ;</l>
     <l n="13">I bring you my handful of songs .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="14">If a perfume be left , if a bloom ,</l>
     <l n="15">Let it live till Italia be risen ,</l>
     <l n="16">To be strewn in the dust of her car</l>
     <l n="17">When her voice shall awake from the tomb</l>
     <l n="18">England , and France from her prison ,</l>
     <l n="19">Sisters , a star by a star .</l>

     <l n="20">I bring you the sword of a song ,</l>
     <l n="21">The sword of my spirit 's desire ,</l>
     <l n="22">Feeble ; but laid at your feet ,</l>
     <l n="23">That which was weak shall be strong ,</l>
     <l n="24">That which was cold shall take fire ,</l>
     <l n="25">That which was bitter be sweet .</l>

     <l n="28">Nor tempered on anvil of steel ;</l>
     <l n="29">But with visions and dreams of the night ,</l>
     <l n="30">But with hope , and the patience of passion ,</l>
     <l n="31">And the signet of love for a seal .</l>

     <l n="41">Slake earth 's hunger and thirst ,</l>
     <l n="42">Lighten , and lead as a mother ;</l>

    <p>PRELUDE</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="44">Between the green bud and the red</l>
     <l n="45">Youth sat and sang by Time , and shed</l>
     <l n="46">From eyes and tresses flowers and tears ,</l>
     <l n="47">From heart and spirit hopes and fears ,</l>
     <l n="48">Upon the hollow stream whose bed</l>
     <l n="49">Is channelled by the foamless years ;</l>
     <l n="50">And with the white the gold-haired head</l>
     <l n="51">Mixed running locks , and in Time 's ears</l>
     <l n="52">Youth 's dreams hung singing , and Time 's truth</l>
     <l n="53">Was half not harsh in the ears of Youth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="54">Between the bud and the blown flower</l>
     <l n="55">Youth talked with joy and grief an hour ,</l>
     <l n="56">With footless joy and wingless grief</l>
     <l n="57">And twin-born faith and disbelief</l>
     <l n="58">Who share the seasons to devour ;</l>
     <l n="59">And long ere these made up their sheaf</l>
     <l n="60">Felt the winds round him shake and shower</l>
     <l n="61">The rose-red and the blood-red leaf ,</l>
     <l n="62">Delight whose germ grew never grain ,</l>
     <l n="63">And passion dyed in its own pain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="64">Then he stood up , and trod to dust</l>
     <l n="65">Fear and desire , mistrust and trust ,</l>
     <l n="66">And dreams of bitter sleep and sweet ,</l>
     <l n="67">And bound for sandals on his feet</l>
     <l n="68">Knowledge and patience of what must</l>
     <l n="69">And what things may be , in the heat</l>
     <l n="70">And cold of years that rot and rust</l>
     <l n="71">And alter ; and his spirit 's meat</l>
     <l n="72">Was freedom , and his staff was wrought</l>
     <l n="73">Of strength , and his cloak woven of thought .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="74">For what has he whose will sees clear</l>
     <l n="75">To do with doubt and faith and fear ,</l>
     <l n="76">Swift hopes and slow despondencies ?</l>
     <l n="77">His heart is equal with the sea 's</l>
     <l n="78">And with the sea-wind 's , and his ear</l>
     <l n="79">Is level to the speech of these ,</l>
     <l n="80">And his soul communes and takes cheer</l>
     <l n="81">With the actual earth 's equalities ,</l>
     <l n="82">Air , light , and night , hills , winds , and streams ,</l>
     <l n="83">And seeks not strength from strengthless dreams .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="84">His soul is even with the sun</l>
     <l n="85">Whose spirit and whose eye are one ,</l>
     <l n="86">Who seeks not stars by day , nor light</l>
     <l n="87">And heavy heat of day by night .</l>
     <l n="88">Him can no God cast down , whom none</l>
     <l n="89">Can lift in hope beyond the height</l>
     <l n="90">Of fate and nature and things done</l>
     <l n="91">By the calm rule of might and right</l>
     <l n="92">That bids men be and bear and do ,</l>
     <l n="93">And die beneath blind skies or blue .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="94">To him the lights of even and morn</l>
     <l n="95">Speak no vain things of love or scorn ,</l>
     <l n="96">Fancies and passions miscreate</l>
     <l n="97">By man in things dispassionate .</l>
     <l n="98">Nor holds he fellowship forlorn</l>
     <l n="99">With souls that pray and hope and hate ,</l>
     <l n="100">And doubt they had better not been born ,</l>
     <l n="101">And fain would lure or scare off fate</l>
     <l n="102">And charm their doomsman from their doom</l>
     <l n="103">And make fear dig its own false tomb .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="104">He builds not half of doubts and half</l>
     <l n="105">Of dreams his own soul 's cenotaph ,</l>
     <l n="106">Whence hopes and fears with helpless eyes ,</l>
     <l n="107">Wrapt loose in cast-off cerecloths , rise</l>
     <l n="108">And dance and wring their hands and laugh ,</l>
     <l n="109">And weep thin tears and sigh light sighs ,</l>
     <l n="110">And without living lips would quaff</l>
     <l n="111">The living spring in man that lies ,</l>
     <l n="112">And drain his soul of faith and strength</l>
     <l n="113">It might have lived on a life 's length .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="114">He hath given himself and hath not sold</l>
     <l n="115">To God for heaven or man for gold ,</l>
     <l n="116">Or grief for comfort that it gives ,</l>
     <l n="117">Or joy for grief 's restoratives .</l>
     <l n="118">He hath given himself to time , whose fold</l>
     <l n="119">Shuts in the mortal flock that lives</l>
     <l n="120">On its plain pasture 's heat and cold</l>
     <l n="121">And the equal year 's alternatives .</l>
     <l n="122">Earth , heaven , and time , death , life , and he ,</l>
     <l n="123">Endure while they shall be to be .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="124">“ Yet between death and life are hours</l>
     <l n="125">To flush with love and hide in flowers ;</l>
     <l n="126">What profit save in these ? ” men cry :</l>
     <l n="127">“ Ah , see , between soft earth and sky ,</l>
     <l n="128">What only good things here are ours ! ”</l>
     <l n="129">They say , “ what better wouldst thou try ,</l>

     <l n="131">Serve , that will give thee ere thou die</l>
     <l n="132">More joy to sing and be less sad ,</l>
     <l n="133">More heart to play and grow more glad ? ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="134">Play then and sing ; we too have played ,</l>
     <l n="135">We likewise , in that subtle shade .</l>
     <l n="136">We too have twisted through our hair</l>
     <l n="137">Such tendrils as the wild Loves wear ,</l>
     <l n="138">And heard what mirth the Maenads made ,</l>
     <l n="139">Till the wind blew our garlands bare</l>
     <l n="140">And left their roses disarrayed ,</l>
     <l n="141">And smote the summer with strange air ,</l>
     <l n="142">And disengirdled and discrowned</l>
     <l n="143">The limbs and locks that vine-wreaths bound .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="144">We too have tracked by star-proof trees</l>
     <l n="145">The tempest of the Thyiades</l>
     <l n="146">Scare the loud night on hills that hid</l>
     <l n="147">The blood-feasts of the Bassarid ,</l>
     <l n="148">Heard their song 's iron cadences</l>
     <l n="149">Fright the wolf hungering from the kid ,</l>
     <l n="150">Outroar the lion-throated seas ,</l>
     <l n="151">Outchide the north-wind if it chid ,</l>
     <l n="152">And hush the torrent-tongued ravines</l>
     <l n="153">With thunders of their tambourines .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="154">But the fierce flute whose notes acclaim</l>

     <l n="157">Timbrels and tabrets , all are dumb</l>
     <l n="158">That turned the high chill air to flame ;</l>
     <l n="159">The singing tongues of fire are numb</l>
     <l n="160">That called on Cotys by her name</l>
     <l n="161">Edonian , till they felt her come</l>

     <l n="163">Lightened along the streams of Thrace .</l>

     <l n="171">So keen is change , and time so strong ,</l>
     <l n="172">To weave the robes of life and rend</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="174">But weak is change , but strengthless time ,</l>

     <l n="177">Songs they can stop that earth found meet ,</l>

      <l n="19">The world 's huge sorrows were inscribed by roll ,</l>
      <l n="20">All theirs on earth who serve and faint for bread ,</l>
      <l n="21">All banished men 's , all theirs in prison dead ,</l>
      <l n="22">Thy love had heart and sword-hand for the whole .</l>
      <l n="23">“ This was my day of glory , ” didst thou say ,</l>
      <l n="24">When , by the scaffold thou hadst hope to climb</l>
      <l n="25">For thy faith 's sake , they brought thee respite ; “ Nay ,</l>
      <l n="26">I shall not die then , I have missed my day . ”</l>
      <l n="27">O hero , O our help , O head sublime ,</l>
      <l n="28">Thy day shall be commensurate with time .</l>

     <l n="1">Am I not he that hath made thee and begotten thee ,</l>
     <l n="2">I , God , the spirit of man ?</l>
     <l n="3">Wherefore now these eighteen years hast thou forgotten me ,</l>
     <l n="4">From whom thy life began ?</l>
     <l n="5">Thy life-blood and thy life-breath and thy beauty ,</l>
     <l n="6">Thy might of hands and feet ,</l>
     <l n="7">Thy soul made strong for divinity of duty</l>
     <l n="8">And service which was sweet .</l>
     <l n="9">Through the red sea brimmed with blood didst thou not follow me ,</l>
     <l n="10">As one that walks in trance ?</l>
     <l n="11">Was the storm strong to break or the sea to swallow thee ,</l>
     <l n="12">When thou wast free and France ?</l>
     <l n="13">I am Freedom , God and man , O France , that plead with thee ;</l>
     <l n="14">How long now shall I plead ?</l>
     <l n="15">Was I not with thee in travail , and in need with thee ,</l>
     <l n="16">Thy sore travail and need ?</l>
     <l n="17">Thou wast fairest and first of my virgin-vested daughters ,</l>
     <l n="18">Fairest and foremost thou ;</l>
     <l n="19">And thy breast was white , though thy hands were red with slaughters ,</l>
     <l n="20">Thy breast , a harlot 's now .</l>
     <l n="21">O foolish virgin and fair among the fallen ,</l>
     <l n="22">A ruin where satyrs dance ,</l>
     <l n="23">A garden wasted for beasts to crawl and brawl in ,</l>
     <l n="24">What hast thou done with France ?</l>
     <l n="25">Where is she who bared her bosom but to thunder ,</l>
     <l n="26">Her brow to storm and flame ,</l>
     <l n="27">And before her face was the red sea cloven in sunder</l>
     <l n="28">And all its waves made tame ?</l>
     <l n="29">And the surf wherein the broad-based rocks were shaking</l>
     <l n="30">She saw far off divide ,</l>
     <l n="31">At the blast of the breath of the battle blown and breaking ,</l>
     <l n="32">And weight of wind and tide ;</l>
     <l n="33">And the ravin and the ruin of throned nations</l>
     <l n="34">And every royal race ,</l>
     <l n="35">And the kingdoms and kings from the state of their high stations</l>
     <l n="36">That fell before her face .</l>
     <l n="37">Yea , great was the fall of them , all that rose against her ,</l>
     <l n="38">From the earth 's old-historied heights ;</l>
     <l n="39">For my hands were fire , and my wings as walls that fenced her ,</l>
     <l n="40">Mine eyes as pilot-lights .</l>
     <l n="41">Not as guerdons given of kings the gifts I brought her ,</l>
     <l n="42">Not strengths that pass away ;</l>
     <l n="43">But my heart , my breath of life , O France , O daughter ,</l>
     <l n="44">I gave thee in that day .</l>
     <l n="45">Yea , the heart 's blood of a very God I gave thee ,</l>
     <l n="46">Breathed in thy mouth his breath ;</l>
     <l n="47">Was my word as a man 's , having no more strength to save thee</l>
     <l n="48">From this worse thing than death ?</l>
     <l n="49">Didst thou dream of it only , the day that I stood nigh thee ,</l>
     <l n="50">Was all its light a dream ?</l>
     <l n="51">When that iron surf roared backwards and went by thee</l>
     <l n="52">Unscathed of storm or stream :</l>
     <l n="53">When thy sons rose up and thy young men stood together ,</l>
     <l n="54">One equal face of fight ,</l>
     <l n="55">And my flag swam high as the swimming sea-foam 's feather ,</l>
     <l n="56">Laughing , a lamp of light ?</l>
     <l n="57">Ah the lordly laughter and light of it , that lightened</l>
     <l n="58">Heaven-high , the heaven 's whole length !</l>
     <l n="59">Ah the hearts of heroes pierced , the bright lips whitened</l>
     <l n="60">Of strong men in their strength !</l>
     <l n="61">Ah the banner-poles , the stretch of straightening streamers</l>
     <l n="62">Straining their full reach out !</l>
     <l n="63">Ah the men 's hands making true the dreams of dreamers ,</l>
     <l n="64">The hopes brought forth in doubt !</l>
     <l n="65">Ah the noise of horse , the charge and thunder of drumming ,</l>
     <l n="66">And swaying and sweep of swords !</l>
     <l n="67">Ah the light that led them through of the world 's life coming ,</l>
     <l n="68">Clear of its lies and lords !</l>
     <l n="69">By the lightning of the lips of guns whose flashes</l>
     <l n="70">Made plain the strayed world 's way ;</l>
     <l n="71">By the flame that left her dead old sins in ashes ,</l>
     <l n="72">Swept out of sight of day ;</l>
     <l n="73">By thy children whose bare feet were shod with thunder ,</l>
     <l n="74">Their bare hands mailed with fire ;</l>
     <l n="75">By the faith that went with them , waking fear and wonder ,</l>
     <l n="76">Heart 's love and high desire ;</l>
     <l n="77">By the tumult of the waves of nations waking</l>
     <l n="78">Blind in the loud wide night ;</l>
     <l n="79">By the wind that went on the world 's waste waters , making</l>
     <l n="80">Their marble darkness white ,</l>
     <l n="81">As the flash of the flakes of the foam flared lamplike , leaping</l>
     <l n="82">From wave to gladdening wave ,</l>
     <l n="83">Making wide the fast-shut eyes of thraldom sleeping</l>
     <l n="84">The sleep of the unclean grave ;</l>
     <l n="85">By the fire of equality , terrible , devouring ,</l>
     <l n="86">Divine , that brought forth good ;</l>
     <l n="87">By the lands it purged and wasted and left flowering</l>
     <l n="88">With bloom of brotherhood ;</l>
     <l n="89">By the lips of fraternity that for love 's sake uttered</l>
     <l n="90">Fierce words and fires of death ,</l>
     <l n="91">But the eyes were deep as love 's , and the fierce lips fluttered</l>
     <l n="92">With love 's own living breath ;</l>
     <l n="93">By thy weaponed hands , brows helmed , and bare feet spurning</l>
     <l n="94">The bared head of a king ;</l>
     <l n="95">By the storm of sunrise round thee risen and burning ,</l>
     <l n="96">Why hast thou done this thing ?</l>
     <l n="97">Thou hast mixed thy limbs with the son of a harlot , a stranger ,</l>
     <l n="98">Mouth to mouth , limb to limb ,</l>
     <l n="99">Thou , bride of a God , because of the bridesman Danger ,</l>
     <l n="100">To bring forth seed to him .</l>
     <l n="101">For thou thoughtest inly , the terrible bridegroom wakes me ,</l>
     <l n="102">When I would sleep , to go ;</l>
     <l n="103">The fire of his mouth consumes , and the red kiss shakes me ,</l>
     <l n="104">More bitter than a blow .</l>
     <l n="105">Rise up , my beloved , go forth to meet the stranger ,</l>
     <l n="106">Put forth thine arm , he saith ;</l>
     <l n="107">Fear thou not at all though the bridesman should be Danger ,</l>
     <l n="108">The bridesmaid should be Death .</l>
     <l n="109">I the bridegroom , am I not with thee , O bridal nation ,</l>
     <l n="110">O wedded France , to strive ?</l>
     <l n="111">To destroy the sins of the earth with divine devastation ,</l>
     <l n="112">Till none be left alive ?</l>
     <l n="113">Lo her growths of sons , foliage of men and frondage ,</l>
     <l n="114">Broad boughs of the old-world tree ,</l>
     <l n="115">With iron of shame and with pruning-hooks of bondage</l>
     <l n="116">They are shorn from sea to sea .</l>
     <l n="117">Lo , I set wings to thy feet that have been wingless ,</l>
     <l n="118">Till the utter race be run ;</l>
     <l n="119">Till the priestless temples cry to the thrones made kingless ,</l>
     <l n="120">Are we not also undone ?</l>
     <l n="121">Till the immeasurable Republic arise and lighten</l>
     <l n="122">Above these quick and dead ,</l>
     <l n="123">And her awful robes be changed , and her red robes whiten ,</l>
     <l n="124">Her warring-robes of red .</l>
     <l n="125">But thou wouldst not , saying , I am weary and faint to follow ,</l>
     <l n="126">Let me lie down and rest ;</l>
     <l n="127">And hast sought out shame to sleep with , mire to wallow ,</l>
     <l n="128">Yea , a much fouler breast :</l>
     <l n="129">And thine own hast made prostitute , sold and shamed and bared it ,</l>
     <l n="130">Thy bosom which was mine ,</l>
     <l n="131">And the bread of the word I gave thee hast soiled , and shared it</l>
     <l n="132">Among these snakes and swine .</l>
     <l n="133">As a harlot thou wast handled and polluted ,</l>
     <l n="134">Thy faith held light as foam ,</l>
     <l n="135">That thou sentest men thy sons , thy sons imbruted ,</l>
     <l n="136">To slay thine elder Rome .</l>
     <l n="137">Therefore O harlot , I gave thee to the accurst one ,</l>
     <l n="138">By night to be defiled ,</l>
     <l n="139">To thy second shame , and a fouler than the first one ,</l>
     <l n="140">That got thee first with child .</l>
     <l n="141">Yet I know thee turning back now to behold me ,</l>
     <l n="142">To bow thee and make thee bare ,</l>
     <l n="143">Not for sin 's sake but penitence , by my feet to hold me ,</l>
     <l n="144">And wipe them with thine hair .</l>
     <l n="145">And sweet ointment of thy grief thou hast brought thy master ,</l>
     <l n="146">And set before thy lord ,</l>
     <l n="147">From a box of flawed and broken alabaster ,</l>
     <l n="148">Thy broken spirit , poured .</l>
     <l n="149">And love-offerings , tears and perfumes , hast thou given me ,</l>
     <l n="150">To reach my feet and touch ;</l>
     <l n="151">Therefore thy sins , which are many , are forgiven thee ,</l>
     <l n="152">Because thou hast loved much .</l>

    <head>Maiden most beautiful , mother most bountiful , lady of lands , Queen and republican , crowned of the centuries whose years are thy sands , See for thy sake what we bring to thee , Italy , here in our hands .</head>
    <head>This is the banner thy gonfalon , fair in the front of thy fight , Red from the hearts that were pierced for thee , white as thy mountains are white , Green as the spring of thy soul everlasting , whose life-blood is light .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Take to thy bosom thy banner , a fair bird fit for the nest ,</l>
     <l n="2">Feathered for flight into sunrise or sunset , for eastward or west ,</l>
     <l n="3">Fledged for the flight everlasting , but held yet warm to thy breast .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">Gather it close to thee , song-bird or storm-bearer , eagle or dove ,</l>
     <l n="5">Lift it to sunward , a beacon beneath to the beacon above ,</l>
     <l n="6">Green as our hope in it , white as our faith in it , red as our love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">Thunder and splendour of lightning are hid in the folds of it furled ;</l>
     <l n="8">Who shall unroll it but thou , as thy bolt to be handled and hurled ,</l>
     <l n="9">Out of whose lips is the honey , whose bosom the milk of the world ?</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Out of thine hands hast thou fed us with pasture of colour and song ; Glory and beauty by birthright to thee as thy garments belong ; Out of thine hands thou shalt give us as surely deliverance from wrong .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Out of thine eyes thou hast shed on us love as a lamp in our night ,</l>
     <l n="2">Wisdom a lodestar to ships , and remembrance a flame-coloured light ;</l>
     <l n="3">Out of thine eyes thou shalt shew us as surely the sun-dawn of right .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Turn to us , speak to us , Italy , mother , but once and a word , None shall not follow thee , none shall not serve thee , not one that has heard ; Twice hast thou spoken a message , and time is athirst for the third .</p>
   <p>Kingdom and empire of peoples thou hadst , and thy lordship made one North sea and south sea and east men and west men that look on the sun ; Spirit was in thee and counsel , when soul in the nations was none .</p>
   <p>Banner and beacon thou wast to the centuries of storm-wind and foam , Ages that clashed in the dark with each other , and years without home ; Empress and prophetess wast thou , and what wilt thou now be , O Rome ?</p>
   <p>Ah , by the faith and the hope and the love that have need of thee now , Shines not thy face with the forethought of freedom , and burns not thy brow ? Who is against her but all men ? and who is beside her but thou ?</p>
   <p>Art thou not better than all men ? and where shall she turn but to thee ? Lo , not a breath , not a beam , not a beacon from midland to sea ; Freedom cries out for a sign among nations , and none will be free .</p>
   <p>England in doubt of her , France in despair of her , all without heart</p>
   <p>Stand on her side in the vanward of ages , and strike on her part ! Strike but one stroke for the love of her love of thee , sweet that thou art !</p>
   <p>Take in thy right hand thy banner , a strong staff fit for thine hand ; Forth at the light of it lifted shall foul things flock from the land ; Faster than stars from the sun shall they fly , being lighter than sand .</p>
   <p>Green thing to green in the summer makes answer , and rose-tree to rose ; Lily by lily the year becomes perfect ; and none of us knows What thing is fairest of all things on earth as it brightens and blows .</p>
   <p>This thing is fairest in all time of all things , in all time is best</p>
   <p>Freedom , that made thee , our mother , and suckled her sons at thy breast ; Take to thy bosom the nations , and there shall the world come to rest .</p>

    <p n="1">P. 7 That called on Cotys by her name . AEsch . Fr . 54</p>
    <p n="2">P. 94</p>
    <p n="3">Was it Love brake forth flower-fashion , a bird with gold on his wings ? Ar . Av . 696 .</p>
    <p n="4">P. 161</p>
    <p n="5">That saw Saint Catherine bodily .</p>
    <p n="6">Her pilgrimage to Avignon to recall the Pope into Italy as its redeemer from the distractions of the time is of course the central act of St. Catherine 's life , the great abiding sign of the greatness of spirit and genius of heroism which distinguished this daughter of the people , and should yet keep her name fresh above the holy horde of saints , in other records than the calendar ; but there is no less significance in the story which tells how she succeeded in humanizing a criminal under sentence of death , and given over by the priests as a soul doomed and desperate ; how the man thus raised and melted out of his fierce and brutal despair besought her to sustain him to the last by her presence ; how , having accompanied him with comfort and support to the very scaffold , and seen his head fall , she took it up , and turning to the spectators who stood doubtful whether the poor wretch could be “ saved , ” kissed it in sign of her faith that his sins were forgiven him . The high and fixed passion of her heroic temperament gives her a right to remembrance and honour of which the miracle-mongers have done their best to deprive her . Cleared of all the refuse rubbish of thaumaturgy , her life would deserve a chronicler who should do justice at once to the ardour of her religious imagination and to a thing far rarer and more precious — the strength and breadth of patriotic thought and devotion which sent this girl across the Alps to seek the living symbol of Italian hope and unity , and bring it back by force of simple appeal in the name of God and of the country . By the light of those solid and actual qualities which ensure to her no ignoble place on the noble roll of Italian women who have deserved well of Italy , the record of her visions and ecstasies may be read without contemptuous intolerance of hysterical disease . The rapturous visionary and passionate ascetic was in plain matters of this earth as pure and practical a heroine as Joan of Arc .</p>
    <p n="7">P. 164</p>
    <p n="8">There on the dim side-chapel wall .</p>

    <p n="10">P. 165</p>
    <p n="11">But blood nor tears ye love not , you .</p>
    <p n="12">In the Sienese Academy the two things notable to me were the detached wall-painting by Sodoma of the tortures of Christ bound to the pillar , and the divine though mutilated group of the Graces in the centre of the main hall . The glory and beauty of ancient sculpture refresh and satisfy beyond expression a sense wholly wearied and well-nigh nauseated with contemplation of endless sanctities and agonies attempted by mediaeval art , while yet as handless as accident or barbarism has left the sculptured goddesses .</p>
    <p n="13">P. 168</p>
    <p n="14">Saw all Italian things save one .</p>
    <p n="15">O patria mia , vedo le mura e gli archi , E le colonne e i simulacri e l'erme Torri degli avi nostri ; Ma la gloria non vedo , Non vedo il lauro a il ferro ond ’ eran carchi I nostri padri antichi .</p>
