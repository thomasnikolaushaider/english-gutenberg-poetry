    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">In presenting to the public the within collection , some of which were published originally under the nom-de-plume of “ Miriam Lester , ” I have had to go into the highways and byways to gather the children who had strayed into various paths .</p>
    <p n="2">Some have been easily found in books of which they were a part , and I desire to thank the editors of “ The Library of Religious Poetry , ” the family of the late Charles Henshaw Dana , of Worcester , Mass ., the Boston “ Herald , ” and others for permission to use such .</p>
    <p n="3">The task of gathering the children who made their debut within the columns of the Boston “ Transcript , ” the Eastport “ Sentinel , ” the Washington “ Post , ” the “ Saturday Gazette ” ( Boston ) , and other journals , has been no light task , and some are still straying beyond my ken .</p>
    <p n="4">Among these “ Contrasted Songs ” I trust that the reader will find something to which the heart may respond .</p>
    <p n="5">Faithfully yours ,</p>
    <p n="6">MARIAN LONGFELLOW .</p>

    <head>SONGS OF THE SEA</head>
    <head>A SONG OF THE SEA</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The mystic sea is singing its golden song to me ;</l>
     <l n="2">I bend to catch its murmur in silent ecstasy ;</l>
     <l n="3">Till , as the music ringeth in sweet and solemn tone ,</l>
     <l n="4">An answering echo waketh a music all mine own !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The sea sings softly , softly upon my listening ear ,</l>
     <l n="6">And still its notes fall ever in cadence full and clear .</l>
     <l n="7">The song that waxeth stronger within my beating heart</l>
     <l n="8">Seems but a second measure — seems of the sea a part !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">And far from all the burdens that day brings in its train ,</l>
     <l n="10">My soul hath found Elysium — renews its youth again !</l>
     <l n="11">I hear the golden billows beat on the rock-bound shore ,</l>
     <l n="12">And still my heart is singing that sweet song o'er and o'er !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">O happy Youth , how quickly the sands of life have run !</l>
     <l n="14">The shades of eve are falling ere yet the day is done !</l>
     <l n="15">The golden sea eternal beats loud and strong and free ,</l>
     <l n="16">And bears upon its bosom a joy eternally !</l>
    </lg>
    <p>THE SPIRIT OF THE WATER</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">‘ Tis the Spirit of the Water ! it breathes upon the sea ;</l>
     <l n="18">As phantom in its motions it glides mysteriously !</l>
     <l n="19">I see the snow-clad islands that deck the opal bay ,</l>
     <l n="20">And the Spirit of the Water now robed in mist and spray .</l>
     <l n="21">The charm that clings eternal to ocean fills my soul ,</l>
     <l n="22">As mist-wreathed waves in grandeur pass on unto their goal !</l>
     <l n="23">Ye phantoms on Life 's ocean ! how like the mist ye seem ,</l>
     <l n="24">As backward turneth memory across Life 's glow and gleam !</l>
     <l n="25">For ye figure forth Life 's pleasures , its cares , its tears and pain ,</l>
     <l n="26">And recall with all their glamour Youth 's joyous dreams again !</l>
     <l n="27">While still the fateful presence glides on across the wave ,</l>
     <l n="28">Nor lifts its veil of mystery until we reach the grave !</l>
     <l n="29">O speak ! is it endeavor , or is it blighted faith ?</l>
     <l n="30">Or is it but the passing of pain — this silent wraith ?</l>
     <l n="31">We know not , oh , we know not here , for o'er Life 's restless sea</l>
     <l n="32">We too glide on , as phantoms all , this side Eternity !</l>
    </lg>
    <p>WITH THE TIDE</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="33">Calm seas that lie ‘ neath summer skies</l>
     <l n="34">And mirror back those skies to me ,</l>
     <l n="35">Upon whose breast white sails arise</l>
     <l n="36">And glide like spirits grand and free .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">Calm seas beneath whose hidden deep</l>
     <l n="38">Are wonders far beyond my ken ,</l>
     <l n="39">There , rocked in murmuring currents , sleep</l>
     <l n="40">The secrets not revealed to men !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="41">Peace , like a white-winged dove descends</l>
     <l n="42">And hovers o'er the waters bright ,</l>
     <l n="43">While glory of the sunset blends</l>
     <l n="44">With tones of the approaching night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="45">My glad soul bids thee welcome , and</l>
     <l n="46">Goes forth upon the ocean 's tide !</l>
     <l n="47">Far from the care that fills the land ,</l>
     <l n="48">To where my spirit would abide !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="49">Till , as the cares of day depart</l>
     <l n="50">And the glad sea its greeting calls ,</l>
     <l n="51">I rise unshackled , strong of heart ,</l>
     <l n="52">And from my life the burden falls !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="53">Thus in this quiet nook I find</l>
     <l n="54">All that I longed and sought in vain</l>
     <l n="55">In the world 's haunts , my soul to bind ,</l>
     <l n="56">And , seeking , found but grief and pain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="57">Now , like a blessing falls thy grace ,</l>
     <l n="58">O grand , beloved , glorious sea !</l>
     <l n="59">Drawn by thy message , face to face ,</l>
     <l n="60">My longing greets thy mystery !</l>
    </lg>
    <p>GRAND MANAN</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="61">( 1881 )</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="62">O solemn cliffs of Grand Manan !</l>
     <l n="63">In silent might ye rise ,</l>
     <l n="64">As bounded by th ’ eternal sea</l>
     <l n="65">And by the azure skies !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="66">Like a proud soul that stands apart ,</l>
     <l n="67">Unknown , unloved , unsought ,</l>
     <l n="68">Ye guard your stronghold silently</l>
     <l n="69">Through many battles fought .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="70">The sea-gull sweeps across your wall ,</l>
     <l n="71">And seaward shapes his course !</l>
     <l n="72">While at your feet the waves beat loud</l>
     <l n="73">In measure wild and hoarse .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="74">O solemn heights ! O grand and calm !</l>
     <l n="75">Ye hold my heart in thrall !</l>
     <l n="76">And not a sound is heard beyond</l>
     <l n="77">The ocean 's rise and fall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="78">But as the waves beat strong and loud</l>
     <l n="79">Upon your rugged shore ,</l>
     <l n="80">Through it the sea 's sad monotone</l>
     <l n="81">I hear forevermore !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="82">The sunset glow hath kissed your heights ,</l>
     <l n="83">As loth to leave you yet ;</l>
     <l n="84">And , bathed in glories red and gold ,</l>
     <l n="85">The eve and you have met .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="86">The boat speeds on — we may not stay ,</l>
     <l n="87">But from my brooding heart</l>
     <l n="88">Your image , while this life remains ,</l>
     <l n="89">Can nevermore depart !</l>
    </lg>
    <p>LEEWARD</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="90">O for the bounding wave , and the salt , salt spray on my face !</l>
     <l n="91">For the sweep of the filling sail , and its free , untrammeled pace !</l>
     <l n="92">For the life that hath no bound to its path but the open sea ;</l>
     <l n="93">For the soul as free as air , that by right belongs to me !</l>
     <l n="94">For power to cast aside these fetters dark and strong ,</l>
     <l n="95">To bound over heaving deep — and no more to feel the thong</l>
     <l n="96">That cuts through the quivering heart and the restless soul , as well !</l>
     <l n="97">I yearn for a fuller life , with a might I cannot quell !</l>
     <l n="98">O for the bounding wave , and the salt , salt spray on my face !</l>
     <l n="99">For the strength to grasp and hold the plan of a waning race .</l>
     <l n="100">For might to compel the tide in its turn to serve my will ,</l>
     <l n="101">That my heart of the fountain deep , may drink to the brim its fill !</l>
    </lg>

    <head>SONGS OF THE FIELDS AND WOODS</head>
    <head>A SONG IN THE EVENING</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">O sweetest bird that ever sang</l>
     <l n="2">In notes of wild rejoicing ;</l>
     <l n="3">Thine even-song as first it rang ,</l>
     <l n="4">Was thrilling in its voicing !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">I felt thy rapture as I heard</l>
     <l n="6">Thy song in all its beauty ;</l>
     <l n="7">To me it scarce seemed but a bird ;</l>
     <l n="8">‘ Twas life , and love , and duty !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">I could not see thy tiny form ,</l>
     <l n="10">As softly closed the gloaming ;</l>
     <l n="11">And like a wanderer in the storm</l>
     <l n="12">My heart was blindly roaming .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">While , as thy song rang pure and clear</l>
     <l n="14">O'er sweet smell of the haying ,</l>
     <l n="15">Mem'ry sped back through many a year ,</l>
     <l n="16">Both light and shade displaying .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">And still thy notes of reed-like tone</l>
     <l n="18">Came clear o'er mead and river ,</l>
     <l n="19">With tender meaning all its own ,</l>
     <l n="20">And trilled and trilled forever !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">“ O heart , ” it sang , “ let thine own life</l>
     <l n="22">Become a song to others ,</l>
     <l n="23">That thou mayst count them in the strife</l>
     <l n="24">Not alien , but as brothers !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">Sing on , sing on , thy notes repeat ,</l>
     <l n="26">Sing life , and love , and duty ,</l>
     <l n="27">That mystic three whose names replete</l>
     <l n="28">Are e'er with heavenly beauty .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">Sing life , the gift of ray divine</l>
     <l n="30">That pierced the gloom of even ;</l>
     <l n="31">The first upon our path to shine ,</l>
     <l n="32">A heritage of Heaven !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">And love — oh , what were life without</l>
     <l n="34">This second gift eternal ,</l>
     <l n="35">That bids the glad earth blossom out</l>
     <l n="36">In summer 's garb supernal !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">Yet love and life were both in vain</l>
     <l n="38">Were duty not a flower</l>
     <l n="39">That springs beneath the blessed rain</l>
     <l n="40">To crown Life 's darkest hour ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">Not unto me a bird , that eve ,</l>
     <l n="42">In notes of earth was singing ,</l>
     <l n="43">But a pure voice its way did cleave</l>
     <l n="44">From Heaven its message bringing !</l>

    <p>MEADOW BLOOM</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="45">My one wee bud that grows in the meadow ,</l>
     <l n="46">Far apart from the flaunting garden blooms ,</l>
     <l n="47">Afar , where the brook and birds are singing ,</l>
     <l n="48">And the soft noon haze o'er the distance looms .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="49">My one wee bud , but to grow so bravely</l>
     <l n="50">Where the rushes rise from the moorland green ,</l>
     <l n="51">Where birds skim close o'er the grassy billows</l>
     <l n="52">And the low breeze murmurs its plaint between .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="53">My one wee song I sing in the even ,</l>
     <l n="54">When the home doth gather its loved ones close ,</l>
     <l n="55">And the world 's afar and hearts grow nearer ,</l>
     <l n="56">And the jar of life sinks into repose .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="57">My one wee song , like a flower growing</l>
     <l n="58">In this life of mine that were else so bare !</l>
     <l n="59">Ah ! shalt thou go forth to do my bidding —</l>
     <l n="60">My love , shall he cull it as blossom fair ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="61">Ah ! flower and song , be this thy meaning ,</l>
     <l n="62">Thy mission of love in the world is clear ;</l>
     <l n="63">The grace once born of seed sown in shadow</l>
     <l n="64">Shall bloom in the hearts that now hold thee dear !</l>

  <p>FRANCIS COSTER 'S STORY</p>
   <p>( I came across this legend , in prose , some time ago , to which was prefixed this note : “ The following exquisite story was written by Anthony of Sienna , and translated from the Dominican records by Francis Coster , a famous preacher of the sixteenth century . Mr. Gould , author of Mysteries of the Middle Ages , has succeeded in rendering it into current English . ”</p>

     <l n="2">( That ever swings , as from its misty birth ) ,</l>
     <l n="3">I kinless stood ! and all the streams that erst</l>

     <l n="5">Sank to a murmur ; even while there burst</l>
     <l n="6">Upon mine eyes that straightway turned me pale !</l>
     <l n="7">I looked and wondered , and I grew as chill</l>

     <l n="10">In breathless awe , mine eyes were turned , I stood</l>
     <l n="11">Appalled ! Forth from the bosom of the deep</l>
     <l n="12">There rose a wondrous chain of towering cliffs ,</l>
     <l n="13">Clear as the lake upon whose mirror sleep</l>
     <l n="14">Light-poised , all tenderly the skiffs ;</l>
     <l n="15">While rays of light played o'er their polished sides ,</l>

     <l n="19">The amethyst deepened to a royal tone</l>
     <l n="20">Of purple , and I stood and gazed , alone !</l>
     <l n="21">I knew that naught of earth was left save me</l>
     <l n="22">To look upon that strange and glorious sea !</l>
     <l n="23">And , as I gazed , wild flames leapt up to seize</l>
     <l n="24">The iceberg 's glow and melt it to their will :</l>
     <l n="25">Naught could their hungry rage of greed appease ,</l>
     <l n="26">While luridly and sullen burned they still ,</l>
     <l n="27">What , then , does it portray — this onslaught fierce</l>
     <l n="28">Of flames upon these sunlit cliffs of ice ,</l>
     <l n="29">If it be not that Evil seeks to pierce</l>
     <l n="30">The armor thrown about the soul 's device ;</l>
     <l n="31">The powers that wage unceasing war ,</l>
     <l n="32">And ever seek to gain what lies afar</l>
     <l n="33">Above them ! “ Souls of just men perfect made , ”</l>
     <l n="34">“ Yield not , ” I cried , “ for here a mortal stands</l>
     <l n="35">“ Alone and helpless in these alien lands ;</l>

     <l n="3">Pure her spirit upward winging now its swift , untrameled way ,</l>
     <l n="4">Far beyond our aching vision , enters that serener day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Patient , pure , she took the burden of this life unto His feet ,</l>
     <l n="6">Who hath called His loved and bid them come unto His presence sweet ;</l>
     <l n="7">All she leaveth , gladly answering her beloved Master 's call ,</l>
     <l n="8">And for her the shadowy valley had no terror to appal .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Passed unto a life all glorious now a ransomed soul she bides ,—</l>
     <l n="10">Ended all the weary watching ,— crossed for aye life 's troubled tides ;</l>
     <l n="11">So we leave her now possessing , to the full , Christ 's own sweet love ,</l>
     <l n="12">And one more of life 's best treasures lives and waits for us above !</l>

     <l n="1">“ It is all right ! ” Yes , friend , it is all right ,</l>
     <l n="2">Although about thee close the shades of night</l>
     <l n="3">To human eyes . To eyes that wake to light</l>
     <l n="4">It is all right — it is all right !</l>

     <l n="6">For thee are past the clouds , and all the fear</l>
     <l n="7">Bred of this life which shall no more appear</l>
     <l n="8">To thee as good ; because thy sky is clear .</l>

     <l n="10">We miss thee now , we miss the happy view</l>
     <l n="11">Of all that through the days of life here grew .</l>
     <l n="12">The old hath passed — for thee hath dawned the new .</l>

     <l n="13">“ It is all right ! ” Thy words , as fell the night ,</l>
     <l n="14">Before thine eyes had pierced the coming light ,</l>
     <l n="15">Fall on our ears a benison all bright ;</l>
     <l n="16">We can but say with thee “ it is all right ! ”</l>
