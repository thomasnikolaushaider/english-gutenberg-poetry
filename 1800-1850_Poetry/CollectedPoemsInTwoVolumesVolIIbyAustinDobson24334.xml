     <p>“ At the Sign of the Lyre , ” Good Folk , we present you With the pick of our quire , And we hope to content you ! Here be Ballad and Song , The fruits of our leisure , Some short and some long — May they all give you pleasure ! But if , when you read , They should fail to restore you , Farewell , and God-speed — The world is before you ! THE LADIES OF ST. JAMES 'S . A PROPER NEW BALLAD OF THE COUNTRY AND THE TOWN . “ Phyllida amo ante alias . ” Virg . The ladies of St. James 's Go swinging to the play ; Their footmen run before them , With a “ Stand by ! Clear the way ! ” But Phyllida , my Phyllida ! She takes her buckled shoon , When we go out a-courting Beneath the harvest moon . The ladies of St. James 's Wear satin on their backs ; They sit all night at Ombre , With candles all of wax : But Phyllida , my Phyllida ! She dons her russet gown , And runs to gather May dew Before the world is down . The ladies of St. James 's ! They are so fine and fair , You 'd think a box of essences Was broken in the air : But Phyllida , my Phyllida ! The breath of heath and furze , When breezes blow at morning , Is not so fresh as hers . The ladies of St. James 's ! They 're painted to the eyes ; Their white it stays for ever , Their red it never dies : But Phyllida , my Phyllida ! Her colour comes and goes ; It trembles to a lily ,— It wavers to a rose . The ladies of St. James 's ! You scarce can understand The half of all their speeches , Their phrases are so grand : But Phyllida , my Phyllida ! Her shy and simple words Are clear as after rain-drops The music of the birds . The ladies of St. James 's ! They have their fits and freaks ; They smile on you — for seconds , They frown on you — for weeks : But Phyllida , my Phyllida ! Come either storm or shine , From Shrove-tide unto Shrove-tide , Is always true — and mine . My Phyllida ! my Phyllida ! I care not though they heap The hearts of all St. James 's , And give me all to keep ; I care not whose the beauties Of all the world may be , For Phyllida — for Phyllida Is all the world to me ! THE OLD SEDAN CHAIR . “ What 's not destroyed by Time 's devouring Hand ? Where 's Troy , and where 's the May-Pole in the Strand ? ” Bramston 's “ Art of Politicks . ” It stands in the stable-yard , under the eaves , Propped up by a broom-stick and covered with leaves : It once was the pride of the gay and the fair , But now ‘ tis a ruin ,— that old Sedan chair ! It is battered and tattered ,— it little avails That once it was lacquered , and glistened with nails ; For its leather is cracked into lozenge and square , Like a canvas by Wilkie ,— that old Sedan chair ! See ,— here came the bearing-straps ; here were the holes For the poles of the bearers — when once there were poles ; It was cushioned with silk , it was wadded with hair , As the birds have discovered ,— that old Sedan chair ! “ Where 's Troy ? ” says the poet ! Look ,— under the seat , Is a nest with four eggs ,— ‘ tis the favoured retreat Of the Muscovy hen , who has hatched , I dare swear , Quite an army of chicks in that old Sedan chair ! And yet — Ca n't you fancy a face in the frame Of the window ,— some high-headed damsel or dame , Be-patched and be-powdered , just set by the stair , While they raise up the lid of that old Sedan chair ? Ca n't you fancy Sir Plume , as beside her he stands , With his ruffles a-droop on his delicate hands , With his cinnamon coat , with his laced solitaire , As he lifts her out light from that old Sedan chair ? Then it swings away slowly . Ah , many a league It has trotted ‘ twixt sturdy-legged Terence and Teague ; Stout fellows !— but prone , on a question of fare , To brandish the poles of that old Sedan chair ! It has waited by portals where Garrick has played ; It has waited by Heidegger 's “ Grand Masquerade ; ” For my Lady Codille , for my Lady Bellair , It has waited — and waited , that old Sedan chair ! Oh , the scandals it knows ! Oh , the tales it could tell Of Drum and Ridotto , of Rake and of Belle ,— Of Cock-fight and Levee , and ( scarcely more rare ! ) Of Fête-days at Tyburn , that old Sedan chair ! “ Heu ! quantum mutata , ” I say as I go . It deserves better fate than a stable-yard , though ! We must furbish it up , and dispatch it ,— “ With Care , ” — To a Fine-Art Museum — that old Sedan chair !</p>

     <p>“ Kill not — for Pity 's sake — and lest ye slay The meanest thing upon its upward way . ” Five Rules of Buddha . I watch you through the garden walks , I watch you float between The avenues of dahlia stalks , And flicker on the green ; You hover round the garden seat , You mount , you waver . Why ,— Why storm us in our still retreat , O saffron Butterfly ! Across the room in loops of flight I watch you wayward go ; Dance down a shaft of glancing light , Review my books a-row ; Before the bust you flaunt and flit Of “ blind Mæonides ” — Ah , trifler , on his lips there lit Not butterflies , but bees ! You pause , you poise , you circle up Among my old Japan ; You find a comrade on a cup , A friend upon a fan ; You wind anon , a breathing-while , Around AMANDA 'S brow ;— Dost dream her then , O Volatile ! E'en such an one as thou ? Away ! Her thoughts are not as thine . A sterner purpose fills Her steadfast soul with deep design Of baby bows and frills ; What care hath she for worlds without , What heed for yellow sun , Whose endless hopes revolve about A planet , ætat One ! Away ! Tempt not the best of wives ; Let not thy garish wing Come fluttering our Autumn lives With truant dreams of Spring ! Away ! Re-seek thy “ Flowery Land ; ” Be Buddha 's law obeyed ; Lest Betty 's undiscerning hand Should slay ... a future PRAED ! THE CURÉ 'S PROGRESS . Monsieur the Curé down the street Comes with his kind old face ,— With his coat worn bare , and his straggling hair , And his green umbrella-case . You may see him pass by the little “ Grande Place , ” And the tiny “ Hôtel-de-Ville ” ; He smiles , as he goes , to the fleuriste Rose , And the pompier Théophile . He turns , as a rule , through the “ Marché ” cool , Where the noisy fish-wives call ; And his compliment pays to the “ Belle Thérèse , ” As she knits in her dusky stall . There 's a letter to drop at the locksmith 's shop , And Toto , the locksmith 's niece , Has jubilant hopes , for the Curé gropes In his tails for a pain d'épice . There 's a little dispute with a merchant of fruit , Who is said to be heterodox , That will ended be with a “ Ma foi , oui ! ” And a pinch from the Curé 's box . There is also a word that no one heard To the furrier 's daughter Lou ; And a pale cheek fed with a flickering red , And a “ Bon Dieu garde M'sieu ! ” But a grander way for the Sous-Préfet , And a bow for Ma'am ' selle Anne ; And a mock “ off-hat ” to the Notary 's cat , And a nod to the Sacristan :— For ever through life the Curé goes With a smile on his kind old face — With his coat worn bare , and his straggling hair , And his green umbrella-case . THE MASQUE OF THE MONTHS . ( FOR A FRESCO . ) Firstly thou , churl son of Janus , Rough for cold , in drugget clad , Com'st with rack and rheum to pain us ;— Firstly thou , churl son of Janus . Caverned now is old Sylvanus ; Numb and chill are maid and lad . After thee thy dripping brother , Dank his weeds around him cling ; Fogs his footsteps swathe and smother ,— After thee thy dripping brother . Hearth-set couples hush each other , Listening for the cry of Spring . Hark ! for March thereto doth follow , Blithe ,— a herald tabarded ; O'er him flies the shifting swallow ,— Hark ! for March thereto doth follow . Swift his horn , by holt and hollow , Wakes the flowers in winter dead . Thou then , April , Iris ’ daughter , Born between the storm and sun ; Coy as nymph ere Pan hath caught her ,— Thou then , April , Iris ’ daughter . Now are light , and rustling water ; Now are mirth , and nests begun . May the jocund cometh after , Month of all the Loves ( and mine ) ; Month of mock and cuckoo-laughter ,— May the jocund cometh after . Beaks are gay on roof and rafter ; Luckless lovers peak and pine . June the next , with roses scented , Languid from a slumber-spell ; June in shade of leafage tented ;— June the next , with roses scented . Now her Itys , still lamented , Sings the mournful Philomel . Hot July thereafter rages , Dog-star smitten , wild with heat ; Fierce as pard the hunter cages ,— Hot July thereafter rages . Traffic now no more engages ; Tongues are still in stall and street . August next , with cider mellow , Laughs from out the poppied corn ; Hook at back , a lusty fellow ,— August next , with cider mellow . Now in wains the sheafage yellow ‘ Twixt the hedges slow is borne . Laden deep with fruity cluster , Then September , ripe and hale ; Bees about his basket fluster ,— Laden deep with fruity cluster . Skies have now a softer lustre ; Barns resound to flap of flail . Thou then , too , of woodlands lover , Dusk October , berry-stained ; Wailed about of parting plover ,— Thou then , too , of woodlands lover . Fading now are copse and cover ; Forests now are sere and waned . Next November , limping , battered , Blinded in a whirl of leaf ; Worn of want and travel-tattered ,— Next November , limping , battered . Now the goodly ships are shattered , Far at sea , on rock and reef . Last of all the shrunk December Cowled for age , in ashen gray ; Fading like a fading ember ,— Last of all the shrunk December . Him regarding , men remember Life and joy must pass away . TWO SERMONS . Between the rail of woven brass , That hides the “ Strangers ’ Pew , ” I hear the gray-haired vicar pass From Section One to Two . And somewhere on my left I see — Whene'er I chance to look — A soft-eyed , girl St. Cecily , Who notes them — in a book . Ah , worthy GOODMAN ,— sound divine ! Shall I your wrath incur , If I admit these thoughts of mine Will sometimes stray — to her ? I know your theme , and I revere ; I hear your precepts tried ; Must I confess I also hear A sermon at my side ? Or how explain this need I feel ,— This impulse prompting me Within my secret self to kneel To Faith ,— to Purity ! “ AU REVOIR . ” A DRAMATIC VIGNETTE . SCENE .— The Fountain in the Garden of the Luxembourg . It is surrounded by Promenaders . MONSIEUR JOLICOEUR . A LADY ( unknown ) . M. JOLICOEUR . ‘ Tis she , no doubt . Brunette ,— and tall : A charming figure , above all ! This promises .— Ahem ! THE LADY . Monsieur ? Ah ! it is three . Then Monsieur 's name Is JOLICOEUR ?... M. JOLICOEUR . Madame , the same . THE LADY . And Monsieur 's goodness has to say ?... Your note ?... M. JOLICOEUR . Your note . THE LADY . Forgive me .— Nay . ( Reads ) “ If Madame [ I omit ] will be Beside the Fountain-rail at Three , Then Madame — possibly — may hear News of her Spaniel . JOLICOEUR . ” Monsieur denies his note ? M. JOLICOEUR . I do . Now let me read the one from you . “ If Monsieur Jolicoeur will be Beside the Fountain-rail at Three , Then Monsieur — possibly — may meet An old Acquaintance . ‘ INDISCREET . ’ ” THE LADY ( scandalized ) . Ah , what a folly ! ‘ Tis not true . I never met Monsieur . And you ? M. JOLICOEUR ( with gallantry ) . Have lived in vain till now . But see : We are observed . THE LADY . ( looking round ) . I comprehend .... ( After a pause . ) Monsieur , malicious brains combine For your discomfiture , and mine . Let us defeat that ill design . If Monsieur but ... ( hesitating ) . M. JOLICOEUR ( bowing ) . Rely on me . THE LADY ( still hesitating ) . Monsieur , I know , will understand ... M. JOLICOEUR . Madame , I wait but your command . THE LADY . You are too good . Then condescend At once to be a new-found Friend ! M. JOLICOEUR ( entering upon the part forthwith ) . How ? I am charmed ,— enchanted . Ah ! What ages since we met ... at Spa ? THE LADY ( a little disconcerted ) . At Ems , I think . Monsieur , maybe , Will recollect the Orangery ? M. JOLICOEUR . At Ems , of course . But Madame 's face Might make one well forget a place . THE LADY . It seems so . Still , Monsieur recalls The Kürhaus , and the concert-balls ? M. JOLICOEUR . Assuredly . Though there again ‘ Tis Madame 's image I retain . THE LADY . Monsieur is skilled in ... repartee . ( How do they take it ?— Can you see ? ) M. JOLICOEUR . Nay ,— Madame furnishes the wit . ( They do n't know what to make of it ! ) THE LADY . And Monsieur 's friend who sometimes came ?... That clever ... I forget the name . M. JOLICOEUR . The BARON ?... It escapes me , too . ‘ Twas doubtless he that Madame knew ? THE LADY ( archly ) . Precisely . But , my carriage waits . Monsieur will see me to the gates ? M. JOLICOEUR ( offering his arm ) . I shall be charmed . ( Your stratagem Bids fair , I think , to conquer them . ) ( Aside ) ( Who is she ? I must find that out . ) — And Madame 's husband thrives , no doubt ? THE LADY ( off her guard ) . Monsieur de BEAU —?... He died at Dôle ! M. JOLICOEUR . Truly . How sad ! ( Aside ) ( Yet , on the whole , How fortunate ! BEAU-pré ?— BEAU-vau ? Which can it be ? Ah , there they go ! ) — Madame , your enemies retreat With all the honours of ... defeat . THE LADY . Thanks to Monsieur . Monsieur has shown A skill PRÉVILLE could not disown . M. JOLICOEUR . You flatter me . We need no skill To act so nearly what we will . Nay ,— what may come to pass , if Fate And Madame bid me cultivate ... THE LADY ( anticipating ) . Alas !— no farther than the gate . Monsieur , besides , is too polite To profit by a jest so slight . M. JOLICOEUR . Distinctly . Still , I did but glance At possibilities ... of Chance . THE LADY . Which must not serve Monsieur , I fear , Beyond the little grating here . M. JOLICOEUR ( aside ) . ( She 's perfect . One may push too far , Piano , sano . ) ( They reach the gates . ) Here we are . Permit me , then ... ( Placing her in the carriage . ) And Madame goes ?... Your coachman ?... Can I ?... THE LADY ( smiling ) . Thanks ! he knows . Thanks ! Thanks ! M. JOLICOEUR ( insidiously ) . And shall we not renew Our ... “ Ems acquaintanceship ? ” THE LADY ( still smiling ) . Adieu ! My thanks instead ! M. JOLICOEUR ( with pathos ) . It is too hard ! ( Laying his hand on the grating . ) To find one 's Paradise is barred !! THE LADY . Nay .— “ Virtue is her own Reward ! ” [ Exit . M. JOLICOEUR ( solus ) . BEAU-vau ?— BEAU-vallon ?— BEAU-manoir ?— But that 's a detail ! ( Waving his hand after the carriage . ) AU REVOIR ! THE CARVER AND THE CALIPH . ( We lay our story in the East . Because ‘ tis Eastern ? Not the least . We place it there because we fear To bring its parable too near , And seem to touch with impious hand Our dear , confiding native land . ) HAROUN ALRASCHID , in the days He went about his vagrant ways , And prowled at eve for good or bad In lanes and alleys of BAGDAD , Once found , at edge of the bazaar , E'en where the poorest workers are , A Carver . Fair his work and fine With mysteries of inlaced design , And shapes of shut significance To aught but an anointed glance ,— The dreams and visions that grow plain In darkened chambers of the brain . And all day busily he wrought From dawn to eve , but no one bought ;— Save when some Jew with look askant , Or keen-eyed Greek from the Levant , Would pause awhile ,— depreciate ,— Then buy a month 's work by the weight , Bearing it swiftly over seas To garnish rich men 's treasuries . And now for long none bought at all , So lay he sullen in his stall . Him thus withdrawn the Caliph found , And smote his staff upon the ground — “ Ho , there , within ! Hast wares to sell ? Or slumber'st , having dined too well ? ” “ ‘ Dined , ’ ” quoth the man , with angry eyes , “ How should I dine when no one buys ? ” “ Nay , ” said the other , answering low ,— “ Nay , I but jested . Is it so ? Take then this coin , ... but take beside A counsel , friend , thou hast not tried . This craft of thine , the mart to suit , Is too refined ,— remote ,— minute ; These small conceptions can but fail ; ‘ Twere best to work on larger scale , And rather choose such themes as wear More of the earth and less of air , The fisherman that hauls his net ,— The merchants in the market set ,— The couriers posting in the street ,— The gossips as they pass and greet ,— These — these are clear to all men 's eye Therefore with these they sympathize . Further ( neglect not this advice ! ) Be sure to ask three times the price . ” The Carver sadly shook his head ; He knew ‘ twas truth the Caliph said . From that day forth his work was planned So that the world might understand . He carved it deeper , and more plain ; He carved it thrice as large again ; He sold it , too , for thrice the cost ; — Ah , but the Artist that was lost !</p>

    <epigraph>
     <p>“ Sermons in stones . ” Who were you once ? Could we but guess , We might perchance more boldly Define the patient weariness That sets your lips so coldly ; You “ lived , ” we know , for blame and fame ; But sure , to friend or foeman , You bore some more distinctive name Than mere “ B. C ., ” — and “ Roman ” ? Your pedestal should help us much . Thereon your acts , your title , ( Secure from cold Oblivion 's touch ! ) Had doubtless due recital ; Vain hope !— not even deeds can last ! That stone , of which you 're minus , Maybe with all your virtues past Endows ... a TIGELLINUS ! We seek it not ; we should not find . But still , it needs no magic To tell you wore , like most mankind , Your comic mask and tragic ; And held that things were false and true , Felt angry or forgiving , As step by step you stumbled through This life-long task ... of living ! You tried the cul-de-sac of Thought ; The montagne Russe of Pleasure ; You found the best Ambition brought Was strangely short of measure ; You watched , at last , the fleet days fly , Till — drowsier and colder — You felt MERCURIUS loitering by To touch you on the shoulder . ‘ Twas then ( why not ? ) the whim would come That howso Time should garble Those deeds of yours when you were dumb , At least you 'd live — in Marble ; You smiled to think that after days , At least , in Bust or Statue , ( We all have sick-bed dreams ! ) would gaze , Not quite incurious , at you . We gaze ; we pity you , be sure ! In truth , Death 's worst inaction Must be less tedious to endure Than nameless petrifaction ; Far better , in some nook unknown , To sleep for once — and soundly , Than still survive in wistful stone , Forgotten more profoundly ! MOLLY TREFUSIS . “ Now the Graces are four and the Venuses two , And ten is the number of Muses ; For a Muse and a Grace and a Venus are you ,— My dear little Molly Trefusis ! ” So he wrote , the old bard of an “ old magazine : ” As a study it not without use is , If we wonder a moment who she may have been , This same “ little Molly Trefusis ! ” She was Cornish . We know that at once by the “ Tre ; ” Then of guessing it scarce an abuse is If we say that where Bude bellows back to the sea Was the birthplace of Molly Trefusis . And she lived in the era of patches and bows , Not knowing what rouge or ceruse is ; For they needed ( I trust ) but her natural rose , The lilies of Molly Trefusis . And I somehow connect her ( I frankly admit That the evidence hard to produce is ) With BATH in its hey-day of Fashion and Wit ,— This dangerous Molly Trefusis . I fancy her , radiant in ribbon and knot , ( How charming that old-fashioned puce is ! ) All blooming in laces , fal-lals and what not , At the PUMP ROOM ,— Miss Molly Trefusis . I fancy her reigning ,— a Beauty ,— a Toast , Where BLADUD 'S medicinal cruse is ; And we know that at least of one Bard it could boast ,— The Court of Queen Molly Trefusis . He says she was “ VENUS . ” I doubt it . Beside , ( Your rhymer so hopelessly loose is ! ) His “ little ” could scarce be to Venus applied , If fitly to Molly Trefusis . No , no . It was HEBE he had in his mind ; And fresh as the handmaid of Zeus is , And rosy , and rounded , and dimpled ,— you 'll find ,— Was certainly Molly Trefusis ! Then he calls her “ a MUSE . ” To the charge I reply That we all of us know what a Muse is ; It is something too awful ,— too acid ,— too dry ,— For sunny-eyed Molly Trefusis . But “ a GRACE . ” There I grant he was probably right ; ( The rest but a verse-making ruse is ) It was all that was graceful ,— intangible ,— light , The beauty of Molly Trefusis ! Was she wooed ? Who can hesitate much about that Assuredly more than obtuse is ; For how could the poet have written so pat “ My dear little Molly Trefusis ! ” And was wed ? That I think we must plainly infer , Since of suitors the common excuse is To take to them Wives . So it happened to her , Of course ,— “ little Molly Trefusis ! ” To the Bard ? ‘ Tis unlikely . Apollo , you see , In practical matters a goose is ;— ‘ Twas a knight of the shire , and a hunting J. P ., Who carried off Molly Trefusis ! And you 'll find , I conclude , in the “ Gentleman 's Mag ., ” At the end , where the pick of the news is , “ On the ( blank ) , at ‘ the Bath , ’ to Sir Hilary Bragg , With a Fortune , MISS MOLLY TREFUSIS . ” Thereupon ... But no farther the student may pry : Love 's temple is dark as Eleusis ; So here , at the threshold , we part , you and I , From “ dear little Molly Trefusis . ” AT THE CONVENT GATE . Wistaria blossoms trail and fall Above the length of barrier wall ; And softly , now and then , The shy , staid-breasted doves will flit From roof to gateway-top , and sit And watch the ways of men . The gate 's ajar . If one might peep ! Ah , what a haunt of rest and sleep The shadowy garden seems ! And note how dimly to and fro The grave , gray-hooded Sisters go , Like figures seen in dreams . Look , there is one that tells her beads ; And yonder one apart that reads A tiny missal 's page ; And see , beside the well , the two That , kneeling , strive to lure anew The magpie to its cage ! Not beautiful — not all ! But each With that mild grace , outlying speech , Which comes of even mood ;— The Veil unseen that women wear With heart-whole thought , and quiet care , And hope of higher good . “ A placid life — a peaceful life ! What need to these the name of Wife ? What gentler task ( I said ) — What worthier — e'en your arts among — Than tend the sick , and teach the young , And give the hungry bread ? ” “ No worthier task ! ” re-echoes She , Who ( closelier clinging ) turns with me To face the road again : — And yet , in that warm heart of hers , She means the doves ’ , for she prefers To “ watch the ways of men . ” THE MILKMAID . A NEW SONG TO AN OLD TUNE . Across the grass I see her pass ; She comes with tripping pace ,— A maid I know ,— and March winds blow Her hair across her face ;— With a hey , Dolly ! ho , Dolly ! Dolly shall be mine , Before the spray is white with May , Or blooms the eglantine . The March winds blow . I watch her go : Her eye is brown and clear ; Her cheek is brown , and soft as down , ( To those who see it near ! ) — With a hey , Dolly ! ho , Dolly ! Dolly shall be mine , Before the spray is white with May , Or blooms the eglantine . What has she not that those have got ,— The dames that walk in silk ! If she undo her ‘ kerchief blue , Her neck is white as milk . With a hey , Dolly ! ho , Dolly ! Dolly shall be mine , Before the spray is white with May , Or blooms the eglantine . Let those who will be proud and chill ! For me , from June to June , My Dolly 's words are sweet as curds — Her laugh is like a tune ;— With a hey , Dolly ! ho , Dolly ! Dolly shall be mine , Before the spray is white with May , Or blooms the eglantine . Break , break to hear , O crocus-spear ! O tall Lent-lilies flame ! There 'll be a bride at Easter-tide , And Dolly is her name . With a hey , Dolly ! ho , Dolly ! Dolly shall be mine , Before the spray is white with May , Or blooms the eglantine . AN OLD FISH POND . Green growths of mosses drop and bead Around the granite brink ; And ‘ twixt the isles of water-weed The wood-birds dip and drink . Slow efts about the edges sleep ; Swift-darting water-flies Shoot on the surface ; down the deep Fast-following bubbles rise . Look down . What groves that scarcely sway ! What “ wood obscure , ” profound ! What jungle !— where some beast of prey Might choose his vantage-ground ! Who knows what lurks beneath the tide ?— Who knows what tale ? Belike , Those “ antres vast ” and shadows hide Some patriarchal Pike ;— Some tough old tyrant , wrinkle-jawed , To whom the sky , the earth , Have but for aim to look on awed And see him wax in girth ;— Hard ruler there by right of might ; An ageless Autocrat , Whose “ good old rule ” is “ Appetite , And subjects fresh and fat ; ” — While they — poor souls !— in wan despair Still watch for signs in him ; And dying , hand from heir to heir The day undawned and dim , When the pond 's terror too must go ; Or creeping in by stealth , Some bolder brood , with common blow , Shall found a Commonwealth . Or say ,— perchance the liker this !— That these themselves are gone ; That Amurath in minimis ,— Still hungry ,— lingers on , With dwindling trunk and wolfish jaw Revolving sullen things , But most the blind unequal law That rules the food of Kings ;— The blot that makes the cosmic All A mere time-honoured cheat ;— That bids the Great to eat the Small , Yet lack the Small to eat ! Who knows ! Meanwhile the mosses bead Around the granite brink ; And ‘ twixt the isles of water-weed The wood-birds dip and drink . AN EASTERN APOLOGUE . ( To E. H. P .) Melik the Sultán , tired and wan , Nodded at noon on his diván . Beside the fountain lingered near JAMÍL the bard , and the vizier — Old YÚSUF , sour and hard to please ; Then JAMÍL sang , in words like these . Slim is Butheina — slim is she As boughs of the Aráka tree ! “ Nay , ” quoth the other , teeth between , “ Lean , if you will ,— I call her lean . ” Sweet is Butheina — sweet as wine , With smiles that like red bubbles shine ! “ True ,— by the Prophet ! ” YÚSUF said , “ She makes men wander in the head ! ” Dear is Butheina — ah ! more dear Than all the maidens of Kashmeer ! “ Dear , ” came the answer , quick as thought , “ Dear ... and yet always to be bought . ” So JAMÍL ceased . But still Life 's page Shows diverse unto YOUTH and AGE : And ,— be the song of Ghouls or Gods ,— TIME , like the Sultán , sits ... and nods .</p>

    <p>TO A MISSAL OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY . Missal of the Gothic age , Missal with the blazoned page , Whence , O Missal , hither come , From what dim scriptorium ? Whose the name that wrought thee thus , Ambrose or Theophilus , Bending , through the waning light , O'er thy vellum scraped and white ; Weaving ‘ twixt thy rubric lines Sprays and leaves and quaint designs ; Setting round thy border scrolled Buds of purple and of gold ? Ah !— a wondering brotherhood , Doubtless , by that artist stood , Raising o'er his careful ways Little choruses of praise ; Glad when his deft hand would paint Strife of Sathanas and Saint , Or in secret coign entwist Jest of cloister humourist . Well the worker earned his wage , Bending o'er the blazoned page ! Tired the hand and tired the wit Ere the final Explicit ! Not as ours the books of old — Things that steam can stamp and fold ; Not as ours the books of yore — Rows of type , and nothing more . Then a book was still a Book , Where a wistful man might look , Finding something through the whole , Beating — like a human soul . In that growth of day by day , When to labour was to pray , Surely something vital passed To the patient page at last ; Something that one still perceives Vaguely present in the leaves ; Something from the worker lent ; Something mute — but eloquent ! A REVOLUTIONARY RELIC . Old it is , and worn and battered , As I lift it from the stall ; And the leaves are frayed and tattered , And the pendent sides are shattered , Pierced and blackened by a ball . ‘ Tis the tale of grief and gladness Told by sad St. Pierre of yore , That in front of France 's madness Hangs a strange seductive sadness , Grown pathetic evermore . And a perfume round it hovers , Which the pages half reveal , For a folded corner covers , Interlaced , two names of lovers ,— A “ Savignac ” and “ Lucile . ” As I read I marvel whether , In some pleasant old château , Once they read this book together , In the scented summer weather , With the shining Loire below ? Nooked — secluded from espial , Did Love slip and snare them so , While the hours danced round the dial To the sound of flute and viol , In that pleasant old château ? Did it happen that no single Word of mouth could either speak ? Did the brown and gold hair mingle , Did the shamed skin thrill and tingle To the shock of cheek and cheek ? Did they feel with that first flushing Some new sudden power to feel , Some new inner spring set gushing At the names together rushing Of “ Savignac ” and “ Lucile ” ? Did he drop on knee before her — “ Son Amour , son Coeur , sa Reine ” — In his high-flown way adore her , Urgent , eloquent implore her , Plead his pleasure and his pain ? Did she turn with sight swift-dimming , And the quivering lip we know , With the full , slow eyelid brimming , With the languorous pupil swimming , Like the love of Mirabeau ? Stretch her hand from cloudy frilling , For his eager lips to press ; In a flash all fate fulfilling Did he catch her , trembling , thrilling — Crushing life to one caress ? Did they sit in that dim sweetness Of attained love 's after-calm , Marking not the world — its meetness , Marking Time not , nor his fleetness , Only happy , palm to palm ? Till at last she ,— sunlight smiting Red on wrist and cheek and hair ,— Sought the page where love first lighting , Fixed their fate , and , in this writing , Fixed the record of it there . Did they marry midst the smother , Shame and slaughter of it all ? Did she wander like that other Woful , wistful , wife and mother , Round and round his prison wall ;— Wander wailing , as the plover Waileth , wheeleth , desolate , Heedless of the hawk above her , While as yet the rushes cover , Waning fast , her wounded mate ,— Wander , till his love 's eyes met hers , Fixed and wide in their despair ? Did he burst his prison fetters , Did he write sweet , yearning letters , “ A Lucile ,— en Angleterre ” ? Letters where the reader , reading , Halts him with a sudden stop , For he feels a man 's heart bleeding , Draining out its pain 's exceeding — Half a life , at every drop : Letters where Love 's iteration Seems to warble and to rave ; Letters where the pent sensation Leaps to lyric exultation , Like a song-bird from a grave . Where , through Passion 's wild repeating , Peep the Pagan and the Gaul , Politics and love competing , Abelard and Cato greeting , Rousseau ramping over all . Yet your critic 's right — you waive it , Whirled along the fever-flood ; And its touch of truth shall save it , And its tender rain shall lave it , For at least you read Amavit , Written there in tears of blood . Did they hunt him to his hiding , Tracking traces in the snow ? Did they tempt him out , confiding , Shoot him ruthless down , deriding , By the ruined old château ? Left to lie , with thin lips resting Frozen to a smile of scorn , Just the bitter thought 's suggesting , At this excellent new jesting Of the rabble Devil-born . Till some “ tiger-monkey , ” finding These few words the covers bear , Some swift rush of pity blinding , Sent them in the shot-pierced binding “ A Lucile , en Angleterre . ” Fancies only ! Nought the covers , Nothing more the leaves reveal , Yet I love it for its lovers , For the dream that round it hovers Of “ Savignac ” and “ Lucile . ” A MADRIGAL . Before me , careless lying , Young Love his ware comes crying ; Full soon the elf untreasures His pack of pains and pleasures ,— With roguish eye , He bids me buy From out his pack of treasures . His wallet 's stuffed with blisses , With true-love-knots and kisses , With rings and rosy fetters , And sugared vows and letters ;— He holds them out With boyish flout , And bids me try the fetters . Nay , Child ( I cry ) , I know them ; There 's little need to show them ! Too well for new believing I know their past deceiving ,— I am too old ( I say ) , and cold , To-day , for new believing ! But still the wanton presses , With honey-sweet caresses , And still , to my undoing , He wins me , with his wooing , To buy his ware With all its care , Its sorrow and undoing . A SONG TO THE LUTE . When first I came to Court , Fa la ! When first I came to Court , I deemed Dan Cupid but a boy , And Love an idle sport , A sport whereat a man might toy With little hurt and mickle joy — When first I came to Court ! Too soon I found my fault , Fa la ! Too soon I found my fault ; The fairest of the fair brigade Advanced to mine assault . Alas ! against an adverse maid Nor fosse can serve nor palisade — Too soon I found my fault ! When SILVIA 'S eyes assail , Fa la ! When SILVIA 'S eyes assail , No feint the arts of war can show , No counterstroke avail ; Naught skills but arms away to throw , And kneel before that lovely foe , When SILVIA 'S eyes assail ! Yet is all truce in vain , Fa la ! Yet is all truce in vain , Since she that spares doth still pursue To vanquish once again ; And naught remains for man to do But fight once more , to yield anew , And so all truce is vain ! A GARDEN SONG . ( To W. E. H .) Here , in this sequestered close Bloom the hyacinth and rose ; Here beside the modest stock Flaunts the flaring hollyhock ; Here , without a pang , one sees Ranks , conditions , and degrees . All the seasons run their race In this quiet resting place ; Peach , and apricot , and fig Here will ripen , and grow big ; Here is store and overplus ,— More had not Alcinoüs ! Here , in alleys cool and green , Far ahead the thrush is seen ; Here along the southern wall Keeps the bee his festival ; All is quiet else — afar Sounds of toil and turmoil are . Here be shadows large and long ; Here be spaces meet for song ; Grant , O garden-god , that I , Now that none profane is nigh ,— Now that mood and moment please , Find the fair Pierides ! A CHAPTER OF FROISSART . ( GRANDPAPA LOQUITUR . ) You do n't know Froissart now , young folks . This age , I think , prefers recitals Of high-spiced crime , with “ slang ” for jokes , And startling titles ; But , in my time , when still some few Loved “ old Montaigne , ” and praised Pope 's Homer ( Nay , thought to style him “ poet ” too , Were scarce misnomer ) , Sir John was less ignored . Indeed , I can re-call how Some-one present ( Who spoils her grandson , Frank ! ) would read And find him pleasant ; For ,— by this copy ,— hangs a Tale . Long since , in an old house in Surrey , Where men knew more of “ morning ale ” Than “ Lindley Murray , ” In a dim-lighted , whip-hung hall , ‘ Neath Hogarth 's “ Midnight Conversation , ” It stood ; and oft ‘ twixt spring and fall , With fond elation , I turned the brown old leaves . For there All through one hopeful happy summer , At such a page ( I well knew where ) , Some secret comer , Whom I can picture , ‘ Trix , like you ( Though scarcely such a colt unbroken ) , Would sometimes place for private view A certain token ;— A rose-leaf meaning “ Garden Wall , ” An ivy-leaf for “ Orchard corner , ” A thorn to say “ Do n't come at all , ” — Unwelcome warner !— Not that , in truth , our friends gainsaid ; But then Romance required dissembling , ( Ann Radcliffe taught us that ! ) which bred Some genuine trembling ; Though , as a rule , all used to end In such kind confidential parley As may to you kind Fortune send , You long-legged Charlie , When your time comes . How years slip on ! We had our crosses like our betters ; Fate sometimes looked askance upon Those floral letters ; And once , for three long days disdained , The dust upon the folio settled ; For some-one , in the right , was pained , And some-one nettled , That sure was in the wrong , but spake Of fixed intent and purpose stony To serve King George , enlist and make Minced-meat of “ Boney , ” Who yet survived — ten years at least . And so , when she I mean came hither , One day that need for letters ceased , She brought this with her ! Here is the leaf-stained Chapter :— How The English King laid Siege to Calais ; I think Gran . knows it even now ,— Go ask her , Alice . TO THE MAMMOTH-TORTOISE OF THE MASCARENE ISLANDS .</p>

     <p>“ Tuque , Testudo , resonare septem Callida nervis . ” Hor . iii . 11 . Monster Chelonian , you suggest To some , no doubt , the calm ,— The torpid ease of islets drest In fan-like fern and palm ; To some your cumbrous ways , perchance , Darwinian dreams recall ; And some your Rip-van-Winkle glance , And ancient youth appal ; So widely varied views dispose : But not so mine ,— for me Your vasty vault but simply shows A LYRE immense , per se , A LYRE to which the Muse might chant A truly “ Orphic tale , ” Could she but find that public want , A Bard — of equal scale ! Oh , for a Bard of awful words , And lungs serenely strong , To sweep from your sonorous chords Niagaras of song , Till , dinned by that tremendous strain , The grovelling world aghast , Should leave its paltry greed of gain , And mend its ways ... at last ! A ROMAN “ ROUND-ROBIN . ” ( “ HIS FRIENDS ” TO QUINTUS HORATIUS FLACCUS . ) “ Hæc decies repetita [ non ] placebit . ” — Ars Poetica . Flaccus , you write us charming songs : No bard we know possesses In such perfection what belongs To brief and bright addresses ; No man can say that Life is short With mien so little fretful ; No man to Virtue 's paths exhort In phrases less regretful ; Or touch , with more serene distress , On Fortune 's ways erratic ; And then delightfully digress From Alp to Adriatic : All this is well , no doubt , and tends Barbarian minds to soften ; But , HORACE — we , we are your friends — Why tell us this so often ? Why feign to spread a cheerful feast , And then thrust in our faces These barren scraps ( to say the least ) Of Stoic common-places ? Recount , and welcome , your pursuits : Sing Lydë 's lyre and hair ; Sing drums and Berecynthian flutes ; Sing parsley-wreaths ; but spare ,— O , spare to sing , what none deny , That things we love decay ;— That Time and Gold have wings to fly ;— That all must Fate obey ! Or bid us dine — on this day week — And pour us , if you can , As soft and sleek as girlish cheek , Your inmost Cæcuban ;— Of that we fear not overplus ; But your didactic ‘ tap ’ — Forgive us !— grows monotonous ; Nunc vale ! Verbum sap . VERSES TO ORDER . ( FOR A DRAWING BY E. A . ABBEY . ) How weary ‘ twas to wait ! The year Went dragging slowly on ; The red leaf to the running brook Dropped sadly , and was gone ; December came , and locked in ice The plashing of the mill ; The white snow filled the orchard up ; But she was waiting still . Spring stirred and broke . The rooks once more ‘ Gan cawing in the loft ; The young lambs ’ new awakened cries Came trembling from the croft ; The clumps of primrose filled again The hollows by the way ; The pale wind-flowers blew ; but she Grew paler still than they . How weary ‘ twas to wait ! With June , Through all the drowsy street , Came distant murmurs of the war , And rumours of the fleet ; The gossips , from the market-stalls , Cried news of Joe and Tim ; But June shed all her leaves , and still There came no news of him . And then , at last , at last , at last , One blessèd August morn , Beneath the yellowing autumn elms , Pang-panging came the horn ; The swift coach paused a creaking-space , Then flashed away , and passed ; But she stood trembling yet , and dazed : The news had come — at last ! And thus the artist saw her stand , While all around her seems As vague and shadowy as the shapes That flit from us in dreams ; And naught in all the world is true , Save those few words which tell That he she lost is found again — Is found again — and well ! A LEGACY . Ah , Postumus , we all must go : This keen North-Easter nips my shoulder ; My strength begins to fail ; I know You find me older ; I 've made my Will . Dear , faithful friend — My Muse 's friend and not my purse 's ! Who still would hear and still commend My tedious verses , How will you live — of these deprived ? I 've learned your candid soul . The venal ,— The sordid friend had scarce survived A test so penal ; But you — Nay , nay , ‘ tis so . The rest Are not as you : you hide your merit ; You , more than all , deserve the best True friends inherit ;— Not gold ,— that hearts like yours despise ; Not “ spacious dirt ” ( your own expression ) , No ; but the rarer , dearer prize — The Life 's Confession ! You catch my thought ? What ! Ca n't you guess ? You , you alone , admired my Cantos ;— I 've left you , P ., my whole MS ., In three portmanteaus ! “ LITTLE BLUE-RIBBONS . ” “ Little Blue-Ribbons ! ” We call her that From the ribbons she wears in her favourite hat ; For may not a person be only five , And yet have the neatest of taste alive ?— As a matter of fact , this one has views Of the strictest sort as to frocks and shoes ; And we never object to a sash or bow , When “ little Blue-Ribbons ” prefers it so . “ Little Blue-Ribbons ” has eyes of blue , And an arch little mouth , when the teeth peep through ; And her primitive look is wise and grave , With a sense of the weight of the word “ behave ; ” Though now and again she may condescend To a radiant smile for a private friend ; But to smile for ever is weak , you know , And “ little Blue-Ribbons ” regards it so . She 's a staid little woman ! And so as well Is her ladyship 's doll , “ Miss Bonnibelle ; ” But I think what at present the most takes up The thoughts of her heart is her last new cup ; For the object thereon ,— be it understood ,— Is the “ Robin that buried the ‘ Babes in the Wood ’ ” — It is not in the least like a robin , though , But “ little Blue-Ribbons ” declares it so . “ Little Blue-Ribbons ” believes , I think , That the rain comes down for the birds to drink ; Moreover , she holds , in a cab you 'd get To the spot where the suns of yesterday set ; And I know that she fully expects to meet With a lion or wolf in Regent Street ! We may smile , and deny as we like — But , no ; For “ little Blue-Ribbons ” still dreams it so . Dear “ little Blue-Ribbons ! ” She tells us all That she never intends to be “ great ” and “ tall ” ; ( For how could she ever contrive to sit In her “ own , own chair , ” if she grew one bit ! ) And , further , she says , she intends to stay In her “ darling home ” till she gets “ quite gray ; ” Alas ! we are gray ; and we doubt , you know , But “ little Blue-Ribbons ” will have it so ! LINES TO A STUPID PICTURE . “ — the music of the moon Sleeps in the plain eggs of the nightingale . ” Aylmer 's Field . Five geese ,— a landscape damp and wild ,— A stunted , not too pretty , child , Beneath a battered gingham ; Such things , to say the least , require A Muse of more-than-average Fire Effectively to sing ‘ em . And yet — Why should they ? Souls of mark Have sprung from such ;— e'en Joan of Arc Had scarce a grander duty ; Not always ( ‘ tis a maxim trite ) From righteous sources comes the right ,— From beautiful , the beauty .</p>

    <docImprint>Who shall decide where seed is sown ? Maybe some priceless germ was blown To this unwholesome marish ; ( And what must grow will still increase , Though cackled round by half the geese And ganders in the parish . ) Maybe this homely face may hide A Staël before whose mannish pride Our frailer sex shall tremble ; Perchance this audience anserine May hiss ( O fluttering Muse of mine ! ) — May hiss — a future Kemble ! Or say the gingham shadows o'er An undeveloped Hannah More !— A latent Mrs . Trimmer !! Who shall affirm it ?— who deny ?— Since of the truth nor you nor I Discern the faintest glimmer ? So then — Caps off , my Masters all ; Reserve your final word ,— recall Your all-too-hasty strictures ; Caps off , I say , for Wisdom sees Undreamed potentialities In most unhopeful pictures .

     <p>“ On court , hélas ! après la vérité ; Ah ! croyez-moi , l'erreur a son mérite . ” Voltaire . Curled in a maze of dolls and bricks , I find Miss Mary , ætat six , Blonde , blue-eyed , frank , capricious , Absorbed in her first fairy book , From which she scarce can pause to look , Because it 's “ so delicious ! ” “ Such marvels , too . A wondrous Boat , In which they cross a magic Moat , That 's smooth as glass to row on — A Cat that brings all kinds of things ; And see , the Queen has angel wings — Then OGRE comes ” — and so on . What trash it is ! How sad to find ( Dear Moralist ! ) the childish mind , So active and so pliant . Rejecting themes in which you mix Fond truths and pleasing facts , to fix On tales of Dwarf and Giant ! In merest prudence men should teach That cats mellifluous in speech Are painful contradictions ; That science ranks as monstrous things Two pairs of upper limbs ; so wings — E'en angels ’ wings !— are fictions : That there 's no giant now but Steam ; That life , although “ an empty dream , ” Is scarce a “ land of Fairy . ” “ Of course I said all this ? ” Why , no ; I did a thing far wiser , though ,— I read the tale with Mary .</p>

    <p>TO A CHILD . ( FROM THE “ GARLAND OF RACHEL . ” ) How shall I sing you , Child , for whom So many lyres are strung ; Or how the only tone assume That fits a Maid so young ? What rocks there are on either hand ! Suppose — ‘ tis on the cards — You should grow up with quite a grand Platonic hate for bards ! How shall I then be shamed , undone , For ah ! with what a scorn Your eyes must greet that luckless One Who rhymed you , newly born ,— Who o'er your “ helpless cradle ” bent His idle verse to turn ; And twanged his tiresome instrument Above your unconcern ! Nay ,— let my words be so discreet , That , keeping Chance in view , Whatever after fate you meet A part may still be true . Let others wish you mere good looks ,— Your sex is always fair ; Or to be writ in Fortune 's books ,— She 's rich who has to spare : I wish you but a heart that 's kind , A head that 's sound and clear ; ( Yet let the heart be not too blind , The head not too severe ! ) A joy of life , a frank delight ; A not-too-large desire ; And — if you fail to find a Knight — At least ... a trusty Squire . HOUSEHOLD ART . “ Mine be a cot , ” for the hours of play , Of the kind that is built by MISS GREENAWAY ; Where the walls are low , and the roofs are red , And the birds are gay in the blue o'erhead ; And the dear little figures , in frocks and frills , Go roaming about at their own sweet wills , And “ play with the pups , ” and “ reprove the calves , ” And do nought in the world ( but Work ) by halves , From “ Hunt the Slipper ” and “ Riddle-me-ree ” To watching the cat in the apple-tree . O Art of the Household ! Men may prate Of their ways “ intense ” and Italianate ,— They may soar on their wings of sense , and float To the au delà and the dim remote ,— Till the last sun sink in the last-lit West , ‘ Tis the Art at the Door that will please the best ; To the end of Time ‘ twill be still the same , For the Earth first laughed when the children came ! THE DISTRESSED POET . A SUGGESTION FROM HOGARTH . One knows the scene so well ,— a touch , A word , brings back again That room , not garnished overmuch , In gusty Drury Lane ; The empty safe , the child that cries , The kittens on the coat , The good-wife with her patient eyes , The milkmaid 's tuneless throat ; And last , in that mute woe sublime , The luckless verseman 's air : The “ Bysshe , ” the foolscap and the rhyme ,— The Rhyme ... that is not there ! Poor Bard ! to dream the verse inspired — With dews Castalian wet — Is built from cold abstractions squired By “ Bysshe , ” his epithet ! Ah ! when she comes , the glad-eyed Muse , No step upon the stair Betrays the guest that none refuse ,— She takes us unaware ; And tips with fire our lyric lips , And sets our hearts a-flame , And then , like Ariel , off she trips , And none know how she came . Only , henceforth , for right or wrong , By some dull sense grown keen , Some blank hour blossomed into song , We feel that she has been . JOCOSA LYRA .</p>

     <p>In our hearts is the Great One of Avon Engraven , And we climb the cold summits once built on By Milton . But at times not the air that is rarest Is fairest , And we long in the valley to follow Apollo . Then we drop from the heights atmospheric To Herrick , Or we pour the Greek honey , grown blander , Of Landor ; Or our cosiest nook in the shade is Where Praed is , Or we toss the light bells of the mocker With Locker . Oh , the song where not one of the Graces Tight-laces ,— Where we woo the sweet Muses not starchly , But archly ,— Where the verse , like a piper a-Maying , Comes playing ,— And the rhyme is as gay as a dancer In answer ,— It will last till men weary of pleasure In measure ! It will last till men weary of laughter ... And after ! MY BOOKS .

While cynic CHARLES still trimm 'd the vane ‘ Twixt Querouaille and Castlemaine , In days that shocked JOHN EVELYN , My First Possessor fixed me in . In days of Dutchmen , and of frost , The narrow sea with JAMES I cross 'd , Returning when once more began The Age of Saturn and of ANNE . I am a part of all the past ; I knew the GEORGES , first and last ; I have been oft where else was none Save the great wig of ADDISON ; And seen on shelves beneath me grope The little eager form of POPE . I lost the Third that owned me when French NOAILLES fled at Dettingen ; The year JAMES WOLFE surpris 'd Quebec , The Fourth in hunting broke his neck ; The day that WILLIAM HOGARTH dy 'd , The Fifth one found me in Cheapside . This was a Scholar , one of those Whose Greek is sounder than their hose ; He lov 'd old Books and nappy ale , So liv 'd at Streatham , next to THRALE . ‘ Twas there this stain of grease I boast Was made by Dr. JOHNSON 'S toast . ( He did it , as I think , for Spite ; My Master call 'd him Jacobite ! ) And now that I so long to-day Have rested post discrimina , Safe in the brass-wir 'd book-case where I watch 'd the Vicar 's whit'ning hair , Must I these travell 'd bones inter In some Collector 's sepulchre ! Must I be torn herefrom and thrown With frontispiece and colophon ! With vagrant E 's , and I 's , and O 's , The spoil of plunder 'd Folios !

Never glad Was he with sweetness of his lady 's eyes , Nor joy he had .

So I , who strove to You I may not earn , Methinks , am come unto so high a place , That though from hence I can but vainly yearn For that averted favour of your face , I shall not turn . No , I am come too high . Whate'er betide , To find the doubtful thing that fights with me , Toward the mountain tops I still shall ride , And cry your name in my extremity , As Palomyde , Until the issue come . Will it disclose No gift of grace , no pity made complete , After much labour done ,— much war with woes ? Will you deny me still in Heaven , my sweet ;— Ah , Death — who knows ? ANDRÉ LE CHAPELAIN . ( Clerk of Love ,<date>1170</date>. ) HIS PLAINT TO VENUS OF THE COMING YEARS . “ Plus ne suis ce que j'ay esté Et ne le sçaurois jamais estre ; Mon beau printemps et mon esté Ont fait le saut par la fenestre . ” Queen Venus , round whose feet , To tend thy sacred fire , With service bitter-sweet Nor youths nor maidens tire ;— Goddess , whose bounties be Large as the un-oared sea ;— Mother , whose eldest born First stirred his stammering tongue , In the world 's youngest morn , When the first daisies sprung :— Whose last , when Time shall die , In the same grave shall lie :— Hear thou one suppliant more ! Must I , thy Bard , grow old , Bent , with the temples frore , Not jocund be nor bold , To tune for folk in May Ballad and virelay ? Shall the youths jeer and jape , “ Behold his verse doth dote ,— Leave thou Love 's lute to scrape , And tune thy wrinkled throat To songs of ‘ Flesh is Grass , ’ ” — Shall they cry thus and pass ? And the sweet girls go by ? “ Beshrew the grey-beard 's tune !— What ails his minstrelsy To sing us snow in June ! ” Shall they too laugh , and fleet Far in the sun-warmed street ? But Thou , whose beauty bright , Upon thy wooded hill , With ineffectual light The wan sun seeketh still ;— Woman , whose tears are dried , Hardly , for Adon 's side ,— Have pity , Erycine ! Withhold not all thy sweets ; Must I thy gifts resign For Love 's mere broken meats ; And suit for alms prefer That was thine Almoner ? Must I , as bondsman , kneel That , in full many a cause , Have scrolled thy just appeal ? Have I not writ thy Laws ? That none from Love shall take Save but for Love 's sweet sake ;— That none shall aught refuse To Love of Love 's fair dues ;— That none dear Love shall scoff Or deem foul shame thereof ;— That none shall traitor be To Love 's own secrecy ;— Avert ,— avert it , Queen ! Debarred thy listed sports , Let me at least be seen An usher in thy courts , Outworn , but still indued With badge of servitude . When I no more may go , As one who treads on air , To string-notes soft and slow , By maids found sweet and fair — When I no more may be Of Love 's blithe company ;— When I no more may sit Within thine own pleasànce , To weave , in sentence fit , Thy golden dalliance ; When other hands than these Record thy soft decrees ;— Leave me at least to sing About thine outer wall , To tell thy pleasuring , Thy mirth , thy festival ; Yea , let my swan-song be Thy grace , thy sanctity . [ Here ended André 's words : But One that writeth , saith — Betwixt his stricken chords He heard the Wheels of Death ; And knew the fruits Love bare But Dead-Sea apples were . ] THE WATER OF GOLD . “ Buy ,— who 'll buy ? ” In the market-place , Out of the market din and clatter , The quack with his puckered persuasive face Patters away in the ancient patter . “ Buy ,— who 'll buy ? In this flask I hold — In this little flask that I tap with my stick , Sir — Is the famed , infallible Water of Gold ,— The One , Original , True Elixir ! “ Buy — who 'll buy ? There 's a maiden there ,— She with the ell-long flaxen tresses ,— Here is a draught that will make you fair , Fit for an emperor 's own caresses ! “ Buy ,— who 'll buy ? Are you old and gray ? Drink but of this , and in less than a minute , Lo ! you will dance like the flowers in May , Chirp and chirk like a new-fledged linnet ! “ Buy ,— who 'll buy ? Is a baby ill ? Drop but a drop of this in his throttle , Straight he will gossip and gorge his fill , Brisk as a burgher over a bottle ! “ Here is wealth for your life ,— if you will but ask ; Here is health for your limb , without lint or lotion ; Here is all that you lack , in this tiny flask ; And the price is a couple of silver groschen ! “ Buy ,— who 'll buy ? ” So the tale runs on : And still in the great world 's market-places The Quack , with his quack catholicon , Finds ever his crowd of upturned faces ; For he plays on our hearts with his pipe and drum , On our vague regret , on our weary yearning ; For he sells the thing that never can come , Or the thing that has vanished , past returning .

     <p>“ De mémoires de Roses on n'a point vu mourir le Jardinier . ” The Rose in the garden slipped her bud , And she laughed in the pride of her youthful blood , As she thought of the Gardener standing by — “ He is old ,— so old ! And he soon must die ! ” The full Rose waxed in the warm June air , And she spread and spread till her heart lay bare ; And she laughed once more as she heard his tread — “ He is older now ! He will soon be dead ! ” But the breeze of the morning blew , and found That the leaves of the blown Rose strewed the ground ; And he came at noon , that Gardener old , And he raked them gently under the mould . And I wove the thing to a random rhyme , For the Rose is Beauty , the Gardener , Time . DON QUIXOTE . Behind thy pasteboard , on thy battered hack , Thy lean cheek striped with plaster to and fro , Thy long spear levelled at the unseen foe , And doubtful Sancho trudging at thy back , Thou wert a figure strange enough , good lack ! To make Wiseacredom , both high and low , Rub purblind eyes , and ( having watched thee go ) Dispatch its Dogberrys upon thy track : Alas ! poor Knight ! Alas ! poor soul possest ? Yet would to-day when Courtesy grows chill , And life 's fine loyalties are turned to jest , Some fire of thine might burn within us still ! Ah , would but one might lay his lance in rest , And charge in earnest — were it but a mill ! A BROKEN SWORD . ( To A. L .) The shopman shambled from the doorway out And twitched it down — Snapped in the blade ! ‘ Twas scarcely dear , I doubt , At half-a-crown . Useless enough ! And yet can still be seen , In letters clear , Traced on the metal 's rusty damaskeen — “ Povr Paruenyr . ” Whose was it once ?— Who manned it once in hope His fate to gain ? Who was it dreamed his oyster-world should ope To this — in vain ? Maybe with some stout Argonaut it sailed The Western Seas ; Maybe but to some paltry Nym availed For toasting cheese ! Or decked by Beauty on some morning lawn With silken knot , Perchance , ere night , for Church and King ‘ twas drawn — Perchance ‘ twas not ! Who knows — or cares ? To-day , ‘ mid foils and gloves Its hilt depends , Flanked by the favours of forgotten loves ,— Remembered friends ;— And oft its legend lends , in hours of stress , A word to aid ; Or like a warning comes , in puffed success , Its broken blade . THE POET 'S SEAT . AN IDYLL OF THE SUBURBS . “ Ille terrarum mihi præter omnes Angulus Ridet . ” — Hor . ii . 6 . It was an elm-tree root of yore , With lordly trunk , before they lopped it , And weighty , said those five who bore Its bulk across the lawn , and dropped it Not once or twice , before it lay . With two young pear-trees to protect it , Safe where the Poet hoped some day The curious pilgrim would inspect it . He saw him with his Poet 's eye , The stately Maori , turned from etching The ruin of St. Paul 's , to try Some object better worth the sketching :— He saw him , and it nerved his strength What time he hacked and hewed and scraped it , Until the monster grew at length The Master-piece to which he shaped it . To wit — a goodly garden seat , And fit alike for Shah or Sophy , With shelf for cigarettes complete , And one , but lower down , for coffee ; He planted pansies ‘ round its foot ,— “ Pansies for thoughts ! ” and rose and arum ; The Motto ( that he meant to put ) Was “ Ille angulus terrarum . ” But “ Oh ! the change ” ( as Milton sings ) — “ The heavy change ! ” When May departed , When June with its “ delightful things ” Had come and gone , the rough bark started ,— Began to lose its sylvan brown , Grew parched , and powdery , and spotted ; And , though the Poet nailed it down , It still flapped up , and dropped , and rotted . Nor was this all . ‘ Twas next the scene Of vague ( and viscous ) vegetations ; Queer fissures gaped , with oozings green , And moist , unsavoury exhalations ,— Faint wafts of wood decayed and sick , Till , where he meant to carve his Motto , Strange leathery fungi sprouted thick , And made it like an oyster grotto . Briefly , it grew a seat of scorn , Bare ,— shameless ,— till , for fresh disaster , From end to end , one April morn , ‘ Twas riddled like a pepper caster ,— Drilled like a vellum of old time ; And musing on this final mystery , The Poet left off scribbling rhyme , And took to studying Natural History . This was the turning of the tide ; His five-act play is still unwritten ; The dreams that now his soul divide Are more of Lubbock than of Lytton ; “ Ballades ” are “ verses vain ” to him Whose first ambition is to lecture ( So much is man the sport of whim ! ) On “ Insects and their Architecture . ” THE LOST ELIXIR . “ One drop of ruddy human blood puts more life into the veins of a poem than all the delusive ‘ aurum potabile ’ that can be distilled out of the choicest library . ” — Lowell . Ah , yes , that “ drop of human blood ! ” — We had it once , may be , When our young song 's impetuous flood First poured its ecstasy ; But now the shrunk poetic vein Yields not that priceless drop again . We toil ,— as toiled we not of old ; Our patient hands distil The shining spheres of chemic gold With hard-won , fruitless skill ; But that red drop still seems to be Beyond our utmost alchemy . Perchance , but most in later age , Time 's after-gift , a tear , Will strike a pathos on the page Beyond all art sincere ; But that “ one drop of human blood ” Has gone with life 's first leaf and bud .

       <l n="49">He was the first who dared to draw</l>

       <l n="52">With fine intricacies of growth .</l>
       <l n="53">He pulled the wraps of flesh apart ,</l>
       <l n="54">And showed the working human heart ;</l>
       <l n="55">He scorned to drape the truthful nude</l>

       <l n="60">Into the light their secret thought .</l>
       <l n="61">Therefore the TARTUFFE-throng who say</l>
       <l n="62">“ Couvrez ce sein , ” and look that way ,—</l>
       <l n="63">Therefore the Priests of Sentiment</l>
       <l n="64">Rose on him with their garments rent .</l>

       <l n="68">Old “ might-have-beens ” and “ heretofores ” ;—</l>
       <l n="69">Then , from that garbled record-list ,</l>

       <l n="73">If to have sense of Joy and Pain</l>
       <l n="74">Too keen ,— to rise , to fall again ,</l>
       <l n="75">To live too much ,— be sin , why then ,</l>
       <l n="76">This was no pattern among men .</l>
       <l n="77">But those who turn that later page ,</l>
       <l n="78">The Journal of his middle-age ,</l>
       <l n="79">Watch him serene in either fate ,—</l>
       <l n="80">Philanthropist and Magistrate ;</l>
       <l n="81">Watch him as Husband , Father , Friend ,</l>
       <l n="82">Faithful , and patient to the end ;</l>
       <l n="83">Grieving , as e'en the brave may grieve ,</l>
       <l n="84">But for the loved ones he must leave :</l>

      <head>PROLOGUE TO ABBEY 'S EDITION OF “ SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER . ”</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">In the year Seventeen Hundred and Seventy and Three ,</l>
       <l n="2">When the GEORGES were ruling o'er Britain the free ,</l>
       <l n="3">There was played a new play , on a new-fashioned plan ,</l>
       <l n="4">By the GOLDSMITH who brought out the Good-Natur 'd Man .</l>
       <l n="5">New-fashioned , in truth — for this play , it appears ,</l>
       <l n="6">Dealt largely in laughter , and nothing in tears ,</l>
       <l n="7">While the type of those days , as the learnèd will tell ye ,</l>
       <l n="8">Was the CUMBERLAND whine or the whimper of KELLY .</l>
       <l n="9">So the Critics pooh-poohed , and the Actresses pouted ,</l>
       <l n="10">And the Public were cold , and the Manager doubted ;</l>
       <l n="11">But the Author had friends , and they all went to see it .</l>
       <l n="12">Shall we join them in fancy ? You answer , So be it !</l>
       <l n="13">Imagine yourself then , good Sir , in a wig ,</l>
       <l n="14">Either grizzle or bob — never mind , you look big .</l>
       <l n="15">You 've a sword at your side , in your shoes there are buckles ,</l>
       <l n="16">And the folds of fine linen flap over your knuckles .</l>
       <l n="17">You have come with light heart , and with eyes that are brighter ,</l>
       <l n="18">From a pint of red Port , and a steak at the Mitre ;</l>
       <l n="19">You have strolled from the Bar and the purlieus of Fleet ,</l>
       <l n="20">And you turn from the Strand into Catherine Street ;</l>
       <l n="21">Thence climb to the law-loving summits of Bow ,</l>
       <l n="22">Till you stand at the Portal all play-goers know .</l>
       <l n="23">See , here are the ‘ prentice lads laughing and pushing ,</l>
       <l n="24">And here are the seamstresses shrinking and blushing ,</l>
       <l n="25">And here are the urchins who , just as to-day , Sir ,</l>
       <l n="26">Buzz at you like flies with their “ Bill o ’ the Play , Sir ? ”</l>
       <l n="27">Yet you take one , no less , and you squeeze by the Chairs ,</l>
       <l n="28">With their freights of fine ladies , and mount up the stairs ;</l>
       <l n="29">So issue at last on the House in its pride ,</l>
       <l n="30">And pack yourself snug in a box at the side .</l>
       <l n="31">Here awhile let us pause to take breath as we sit ,</l>
       <l n="32">Surveying the humours and pranks of the Pit ,—</l>
       <l n="33">With its Babel of chatterers buzzing and humming ,</l>
       <l n="34">With its impudent orange-girls going and coming ,</l>
       <l n="35">With its endless surprises of face and of feature ,</l>
       <l n="36">All grinning as one in a gust of good-nature .</l>
       <l n="37">Then we turn to the Boxes where TRIP in his lace</l>
       <l n="38">Is aping his master , and keeping his place .</l>
       <l n="39">Do but note how the Puppy flings back with a yawn ,</l>
       <l n="40">Like a Duke at the least , or a Bishop in lawn !</l>
       <l n="41">Then sniffs at his bouquet , whips round with a smirk ,</l>
       <l n="42">And ogles the ladies at large — like a Turk .</l>
       <l n="43">But the music comes in , and the blanks are all filling ,</l>
       <l n="44">And TRIP must trip up to the seats at a shilling ;</l>
       <l n="45">And spite of the mourning that most of us wear</l>
       <l n="46">The House takes a gay and a holiday air ;</l>
       <l n="47">For the fair sex are clever at turning the tables ,</l>
       <l n="48">And seem to catch coquetry even in sables .</l>
       <l n="49">Moreover , your mourning has ribbons and stars ,</l>
       <l n="50">And is sprinkled about with the red coats of Mars .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="51">Look , look , there is WILKES ! You may tell by the squint ;</l>
       <l n="52">But he grows every day more and more like the print</l>
       <l n="53">( Ah ! HOGARTH could draw ! ) ; and behind at the back</l>
       <l n="54">HUGH KELLY , who looks all the blacker in black .</l>
       <l n="55">That is CUMBERLAND next , and the prim-looking person</l>
       <l n="56">In the corner , I take it , is Ossian MACPHERSON .</l>
       <l n="57">And rolling and blinking , here , too , with the rest ,</l>
       <l n="58">Comes sturdy old JOHNSON , dressed out in his best ;</l>
       <l n="59">How he shakes his old noddle ! I 'll wager a crown ,</l>
       <l n="60">Whatever the law is he 's laying it down !</l>
       <l n="61">Beside him is REYNOLDS , who 's deaf ; and the hale</l>
       <l n="62">Fresh , farmer-like fellow , I fancy , is THRALE .</l>
       <l n="63">There is BURKE with GEORGE STEEVENS . And somewhere , no doubt ,</l>
       <l n="64">Is the AUTHOR — too nervous just now to come out ;</l>
       <l n="65">He 's a queer little fellow , grave-featured , pock-pitten ,</l>
       <l n="66">Tho ’ they say , in his cups , he 's as gay as a kitten .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="67">But where is our play-bill ? Mistakes of a Night !</l>
       <l n="68">If the title 's prophetic , I pity his plight !</l>
       <l n="69">She Stoops . Let us hope she wo n't fall at full length ,</l>
       <l n="70">For the piece — so ‘ tis whispered — is wanting in strength .</l>
       <l n="71">And the humour is “ low ! ” — you are doubtless aware</l>
       <l n="72">There 's a character , even , that “ dances a bear ! ”</l>
       <l n="73">Then the cast is so poor ,— neither marrow nor pith !</l>
       <l n="74">Why can n't they get WOODWARD or Gentleman SMITH !</l>
       <l n="75">“ LEE LEWES ! ” Who 's LEWES ? The fellow has played</l>
       <l n="76">Nothing better , they tell me , than harlequinade !</l>
       <l n="77">“ DUBELLAMY ” — “ QUICK , ” — these are nobodies . Stay , I</l>
       <l n="78">Believe I saw QUICK once in Beau Mordecai .</l>
       <l n="79">Yes , QUICK is not bad . Mrs. GREEN , too , is funny ;</l>
       <l n="80">But SHUTER , ah ! SHUTER 'S the man for my money !</l>
       <l n="81">He 's the quaintest , the oddest of mortals , is SHUTER ,</l>
       <l n="82">And he has but one fault — he 's too fond of the pewter .</l>
       <l n="83">Then there 's little BULKELY ....</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="84">But here in the middle ,</l>
       <l n="85">From the orchestra comes the first squeak of a fiddle .</l>
       <l n="86">Then the bass gives a growl , and the horn makes a dash ,</l>
       <l n="87">And the music begins with a flourish and crash ,</l>
       <l n="88">And away to the zenith goes swelling and swaying ,</l>
       <l n="89">While we tap on the box to keep time to the playing .</l>
       <l n="90">And we hear the old tunes as they follow and mingle ,</l>
       <l n="91">Till at last from the stage comes a ting-a-ting tingle ;</l>
       <l n="92">And the fans cease to whirr , and the House for a minute</l>
       <l n="93">Grows still as if naught but wax figures were in it .</l>
       <l n="94">Then an actor steps out , and the eyes of all glisten .</l>
       <l n="95">Who is it ? The Prologue . He 's sobbing . Hush ! listen .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <note>Thereupon enters Mr. Woodward in black , with a handkerchief to his eyes , to speak Garrick 's Prologue , after which comes the play . In the volume for which the foregoing additional Prologue was written the following Envoi was added .</note>

    <p n="3">A friendly critic , whose versatile pen it is not easy to mistake , recalls , à-propos of the above , the following passage from Molière , which shows that Chairmen are much the same all the world over :—</p>
    <p n="4">1 Porteur ( prenant un des bâtons de sa chaise ) . Çà , payez-nous vitement !</p>

    <p n="8">“ It has waited by portals where Garrick has played . ” — Page 8 .</p>
    <p n="9">According to Mrs. Carter ( Smith 's Nollekens , 1828 , i . 211 ) , when Garrick acted , the hackney-chairs often stood “ all round the Piazzas [ Covent Garden ] , down Southampton-Street , and extended more than half-way along Maiden-Lane . ”</p>
    <p n="10">“ A skill Préville could not disown . ” — Page 23 .</p>
    <p n="11">Préville was the French Foote , circa 1760 . His gifts as a comedian were of the highest order ; and he had an extraordinary faculty for identifying himself with the parts he played . Sterne , in a letter to Garrick from Paris , in 1762 , calls him “ Mercury himself . ”</p>
    <p n="12">MOLLY TREFUSIS .— Page 32 .</p>
    <p n="13">The epigram here quoted from “ an old magazine ” is to be found in the late Lord Neaves 's admirable little volume , The Greek Anthology ( Blackwood 's Ancient Classics for English Readers ) . Those familiar with eighteenth-century literature will recognize in the succeeding verses but another echo of those lively stanzas of John Gay to “ Molly Mogg of the Rose , ” which found so many imitators in his own day . Whether my heroine is to be identified with a certain “ Miss Trefusis , ” whose Poems are sometimes to be found in the second-hand booksellers ’ catalogues , I know not . But if she is , I trust I have done her accomplished shade no wrong .</p>
    <p n="14">AN EASTERN APOLOGUE .— Page 43 .</p>
    <p n="15">The initials “ E. H. P . ” are those of the late eminent ( and ill-fated ) Orientalist , Professor Palmer . As my lines entirely owed their origin to his translations of Zoheir , I sent them to him . He was indulgent enough to praise them warmly . It is true he found anachronisms ; but as he said these would cause no disturbance to orthodox Persians , I concluded I had succeeded in my little pastiche , and , with his permission , inscribed it to him . I wish now that it had been a more worthy tribute to one of the most erudite and versatile scholars this age has seen .</p>

    <p n="20">“ And its tender rain shall lave it . ” — Page 52 .</p>
    <p n="21">It is by no means uncommon for an editor to interrupt some of these revolutionary letters by a “ Here there are traces of tears . ”</p>

    <p n="25">These lines were reprinted from Notes and Queries in Mr. Andrew Lang 's instructive volume The Library , 1881 , where the curious will find full information as to the enormities of the book-mutilators .</p>
    <p n="26">“ Have I not writ thy Laws ? ” — Page 93 .</p>
    <p n="27">The lines in italic type which follow , are freely paraphrased from the ancient Code d ’ Amour of the XIIth Century , as given by André le Chapelain himself .</p>
    <p n="28">A DIALOGUE , ETC .— Page 107 .</p>
    <p n="29">This dialogue , first printed in Scribner 's Magazine for May , 1888 , was afterwards read by Professor Henry Morley at the opening of the Pope Loan Museum at Twickenham ( July 31st ) , to the Catalogue of which exhibition it was prefixed .</p>

    <p n="34">“ The Journal of his middle-age . ” — Page 118 .</p>
    <p n="35">It is , perhaps , needless to say that the reference here is to the Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon , published posthumously in February , 1755 ,— a record which for its intrinsic pathos and dignity may be compared with the letter and dedication which Fielding 's predecessor and model , Cervantes , prefixed to his last romance of Persiles and Sigismunda .</p>

    <p n="51">THE WATER-CURE .— Page 178 .</p>
    <p n="52">These verses were suggested by the recollection of an anecdote in Madame de Genlis , which seemed to lend itself to eighteenth-century treatment . It was therefore somewhat depressing , not long after they were written , to find that the subject had already been annexed in the Tatler by an actual eighteenth-century writer , who , moreover , claimed to have founded his story on a contemporary incident . Burton , nevertheless , had told it before him , as early as 1621 , in the Anatomy of Melancholy .</p>
