    <docImprint>Winnepurkit , otherwise called George , Sachem of Saugus , married a daughter of Passaconaway , the great Pennacook chieftain , in<date>1662</date>. The wedding took place at Pennacook ( now Concord , N. H .) , and the ceremonies closed with a great feast . According to the usages of the chiefs , Passaconaway ordered a select number of his men to accompany the newly-married couple to the dwelling of the husband , where in turn there was another great feast . Some time after , the wife of Winnepurkit expressing a desire to visit her father 's house was permitted to go , accompanied by a brave escort of her husband 's chief men . But when she wished to return , her father sent a messenger to Saugus , informing her husband , and asking him to come and take her away . He returned for answer that he had escorted his wife to her father 's house in a style that became a chief , and that now if she wished to return , her father must send her back , in the same way . This Passaconaway refused to do , and it is said that here terminated the connection of his daughter with the Saugus chief .— Vide MORTON 'S New Canaan .</docImprint>

     <l n="2">WE had been wandering for many days</l>
     <l n="3">Through the rough northern country . We had seen</l>
     <l n="4">The sunset , with its bars of purple cloud ,</l>
     <l n="5">Like a new heaven , shine upward from the lake</l>
     <l n="6">Of Winnepiseogee ; and had felt</l>
     <l n="7">The sunrise breezes , midst the leafy isles</l>
     <l n="8">Which stoop their summer beauty to the lips</l>
     <l n="9">Of the bright waters . We had checked our steeds ,</l>
     <l n="10">Silent with wonder , where the mountain wall</l>
     <l n="11">Is piled to heaven ; and , through the narrow rift</l>
     <l n="12">Of the vast rocks , against whose rugged feet</l>
     <l n="13">Beats the mad torrent with perpetual roar ,</l>
     <l n="14">Where noonday is as twilight , and the wind</l>
     <l n="15">Comes burdened with the everlasting moan</l>
     <l n="16">Of forests and of far-off waterfalls ,</l>
     <l n="17">We had looked upward where the summer sky ,</l>
     <l n="18">Tasselled with clouds light-woven by the sun ,</l>
     <l n="19">Sprung its blue arch above the abutting crags</l>
     <l n="20">O'erhYpppHeNroofing the vast portal of the land</l>
     <l n="21">Beyond the wall of mountains . We had passed</l>
     <l n="22">The high source of the Saco ; and bewildered</l>
     <l n="23">In the dwarf spruce-belts of the Crystal Hills ,</l>
     <l n="24">Had heard above us , like a voice in the cloud ,</l>
     <l n="25">The horn of Fabyan sounding ; and atop</l>
     <l n="26">Of old Agioochook had seen the mountains ’</l>
     <l n="27">Piled to the northward , shagged with wood , and thick</l>
     <l n="28">As meadow mole-hills ,— the far sea of Casco ,</l>
     <l n="29">A white gleam on the horizon of the east ;</l>
     <l n="30">Fair lakes , embosomed in the woods and hills ;</l>
     <l n="31">Moosehillock 's mountain range , and Kearsarge</l>
     <l n="32">Lifting his granite forehead to the sun !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="33">And we had rested underneath the oaks</l>
     <l n="34">Shadowing the bank , whose grassy spires are shaken</l>
     <l n="35">By the perpetual beating of the falls</l>
     <l n="36">Of the wild Ammonoosuc . We had tracked</l>
     <l n="37">The winding Pemigewasset , overhung</l>
     <l n="38">By beechen shadows , whitening down its rocks ,</l>
     <l n="39">Or lazily gliding through its intervals ,</l>
     <l n="40">From waving rye-fields sending up the gleam</l>
     <l n="41">Of sunlit waters . We had seen the moon</l>
     <l n="42">Rising behind Umbagog 's eastern pines ,</l>
     <l n="43">Like a great Indian camp-fire ; and its beams</l>
     <l n="44">At midnight spanning with a bridge of silver</l>
     <l n="45">The Merrimac by Uncanoonuc 's falls .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="46">There were five souls of us whom travel 's chance</l>
     <l n="47">Had thrown together in these wild north hills</l>
     <l n="48">A city lawyer , for a month escaping</l>
     <l n="49">From his dull office , where the weary eye</l>
     <l n="50">Saw only hot brick walls and close thronged streets ;</l>
     <l n="51">Briefless as yet , but with an eye to see</l>
     <l n="52">Life 's sunniest side , and with a heart to take</l>
     <l n="53">Its chances all as godsends ; and his brother ,</l>
     <l n="54">Pale from long pulpit studies , yet retaining</l>
     <l n="55">The warmth and freshness of a genial heart ,</l>
     <l n="56">Whose mirror of the beautiful and true ,</l>
     <l n="57">In Man and Nature , was as yet undimmed</l>
     <l n="58">By dust of theologic strife , or breath</l>
     <l n="59">Of sect , or cobwebs of scholastic lore ;</l>
     <l n="60">Like a clear crystal calm of water , taking</l>
     <l n="61">The hue and image of o'erleaning flowers ,</l>
     <l n="62">Sweet human faces , white clouds of the noon ,</l>
     <l n="63">Slant starlight glimpses through the dewy leaves ,</l>
     <l n="64">And tenderest moonrise . ‘ T was , in truth , a study ,</l>
     <l n="65">To mark his spirit , alternating between</l>
     <l n="66">A decent and professional gravity</l>
     <l n="67">And an irreverent mirthfulness , which often</l>
     <l n="68">Laughed in the face of his divinity ,</l>
     <l n="69">Plucked off the sacred ephod , quite unshrined</l>
     <l n="70">The oracle , and for the pattern priest</l>
     <l n="71">Left us the man . A shrewd , sagacious merchant ,</l>
     <l n="72">To whom the soiled sheet found in Crawford 's inn ,</l>
     <l n="73">Giving the latest news of city stocks</l>
     <l n="74">And sales of cotton , had a deeper meaning</l>
     <l n="75">Than the great presence of the awful mountains</l>
     <l n="76">Glorified by the sunset ; and his daughter ,</l>
     <l n="77">A delicate flower on whom had blown too long</l>
     <l n="78">Those evil winds , which , sweeping from the ice</l>
     <l n="79">And winnowing the fogs of Labrador ,</l>
     <l n="80">Shed their cold blight round Massachusetts Bay ,</l>
     <l n="81">With the same breath which stirs Spring 's opening leaves</l>
     <l n="82">And lifts her half-formed flower-bell on its stem ,</l>
     <l n="83">Poisoning our seaside atmosphere .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="84">It chanced that as we turned upon our homeward way ,</l>
     <l n="85">A drear northeastern storm came howling up</l>
     <l n="86">The valley of the Saco ; and that girl</l>
     <l n="87">Who had stood with us upon Mount Washington ,</l>
     <l n="88">Her brown locks ruffled by the wind which whirled</l>
     <l n="89">In gusts around its sharp , cold pinnacle ,</l>
     <l n="90">Who had joined our gay trout-fishing in the streams</l>
     <l n="91">Which lave that giant 's feet ; whose laugh was heard</l>
     <l n="92">Like a bird 's carol on the sunrise breeze</l>
     <l n="93">Which swelled our sail amidst the lake 's green islands ,</l>
     <l n="94">Shrank from its harsh , chill breath , and visibly drooped</l>
     <l n="95">Like a flower in the frost . So , in that quiet inn</l>
     <l n="96">Which looks from Conway on the mountains piled</l>
     <l n="97">Heavily against the horizon of the north ,</l>
     <l n="98">Like summer thunder-clouds , we made our home</l>
     <l n="99">And while the mist hung over dripping hills ,</l>
     <l n="100">And the cold wind-driven rain-drops all day long</l>
     <l n="101">Beat their sad music upon roof and pane ,</l>
     <l n="102">We strove to cheer our gentle invalid .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="103">The lawyer in the pauses of the storm</l>
     <l n="104">Went angling down the Saco , and , returning ,</l>
     <l n="105">Recounted his adventures and mishaps ;</l>
     <l n="106">Gave us the history of his scaly clients ,</l>
     <l n="107">Mingling with ludicrous yet apt citations</l>
     <l n="108">Of barbarous law Latin , passages</l>
     <l n="109">From Izaak Walton 's Angler , sweet and fresh</l>
     <l n="110">As the flower-skirted streams of Staffordshire ,</l>
     <l n="111">Where , under aged trees , the southwest wind</l>
     <l n="112">Of soft June mornings fanned the thin , white hair</l>
     <l n="113">Of the sage fisher . And , if truth be told ,</l>
     <l n="114">Our youthful candidate forsook his sermons ,</l>
     <l n="115">His commentaries , articles and creeds ,</l>
     <l n="116">For the fair page of human loveliness ,</l>
     <l n="117">The missal of young hearts , whose sacred text</l>
     <l n="118">Is music , its illumining , sweet smiles .</l>
     <l n="119">He sang the songs she loved ; and in his low ,</l>
     <l n="120">Deep , earnest voice , recited many a page</l>
     <l n="121">Of poetry , the holiest , tenderest lines</l>
     <l n="122">Of the sad bard of Olney , the sweet songs ,</l>
     <l n="123">Simple and beautiful as Truth and Nature ,</l>
     <l n="124">Of him whose whitened locks on Rydal Mount</l>
     <l n="125">Are lifted yet by morning breezes blowing</l>
     <l n="126">From the green hills , immortal in his lays .</l>
     <l n="127">And for myself , obedient to her wish ,</l>
     <l n="128">I searched our landlord 's proffered library ,—</l>
     <l n="129">A well-thumbed Bunyan , with its nice wood pictures</l>
     <l n="130">Of scaly fiends and angels not unlike them ;</l>
     <l n="131">Watts ’ unmelodious psalms ; Astrology 's</l>
     <l n="132">Last home , a musty pile of almanacs ,</l>
     <l n="133">And an old chronicle of border wars</l>
     <l n="134">And Indian history . And , as I read</l>
     <l n="135">A story of the marriage of the Chief</l>
     <l n="136">Of Saugus to the dusky Weetamoo ,</l>
     <l n="137">Daughter of Passaconaway , who dwelt</l>
     <l n="138">In the old time upon the Merrimac ,</l>
     <l n="139">Our fair one , in the playful exercise</l>
     <l n="140">Of her prerogative ,— the right divine</l>
     <l n="141">Of youth and beauty ,— bade us versify</l>
     <l n="142">The legend , and with ready pencil sketched</l>
     <l n="143">Its plan and outlines , laughingly assigning</l>
     <l n="144">To each his part , and barring our excuses</l>
     <l n="145">With absolute will . So , like the cavaliers</l>
     <l n="146">Whose voices still are heard in the Romance</l>
     <l n="147">Of silver-tongued Boccaccio , on the banks</l>
     <l n="148">Of Arno , with soft tales of love beguiling</l>
     <l n="149">The ear of languid beauty , plague-exiled</l>
     <l n="150">From stately Florence , we rehearsed our rhymes</l>
     <l n="151">To their fair auditor , and shared by turns</l>
     <l n="152">Her kind approval and her playful censure .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="153">It may be that these fragments owe alone</l>
     <l n="154">To the fair setting of their circumstances ,—</l>
     <l n="155">The associations of time , scene , and audience ,—</l>
     <l n="156">Their place amid the pictures which fill up</l>
     <l n="157">The chambers of my memory . Yet I trust</l>
     <l n="158">That some , who sigh , while wandering in thought ,</l>
     <l n="159">Pilgrims of Romance o'er the olden world ,</l>
     <l n="160">That our broad land ,— our sea-like lakes and mountains</l>
     <l n="161">Piled to the clouds , our rivers overhung</l>
     <l n="162">By forests which have known no other change</l>
     <l n="163">For ages than the budding and the fall</l>
     <l n="164">Of leaves , our valleys lovelier than those</l>
     <l n="165">Which the old poets sang of ,— should but figure</l>
     <l n="166">On the apocryphal chart of speculation</l>
     <l n="167">As pastures , wood-lots , mill-sites , with the privileges ,</l>
     <l n="168">Rights , and appurtenances , which make up</l>
     <l n="169">A Yankee Paradise , unsung , unknown ,</l>
     <l n="170">To beautiful tradition ; even their names ,</l>
     <l n="171">Whose melody yet lingers like the last</l>
     <l n="172">Vibration of the red man 's requiem ,</l>
     <l n="173">Exchanged for syllables significant ,</l>
     <l n="174">Of cotton-mill and rail-car , will look kindly</l>
     <l n="175">Upon this effort to call up the ghost</l>
     <l n="176">Of our dim Past , and listen with pleased ear</l>
     <l n="177">To the responses of the questioned Shade .</l>

   <p>I . THE MERRIMAC . O child of that white-crested mountain whose springs Gush forth in the shade of the cliff-eagle 's wings , Down whose slopes to the lowlands thy wild waters shine , Leaping gray walls of rock , flashing through the dwarf pine ; From that cloud-curtained cradle so cold and so lone , From the arms of that wintry-locked mother of stone , By hills hung with forests , through vales wide and free , Thy mountain-born brightness glanced down to the sea .</p>

     <l n="27">No warmth of heart , no passionate burst of feeling ,</l>

     <l n="33">Enough for Weetamoo , that she alone</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="39">For she had learned the maxims of her race ,</l>

     <l n="9">Down the vexed centre of that rushing tide ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">Sick and aweary of her lonely life ,</l>
