    <p>TO C. C. L. I pause upon the threshold , Charlotte dear , To write thy name ; so may my book acquire One golden leaf . For Some yet sojourn here Who come and go in homeliest attire , Unknown , or only by the few who see The cross they bear , the good that they have wrought : Of such art thou , and I have found in thee The love and truth that HE , the MASTER , taught ; Thou likest thy humble poet , canst thou say With truth , dear Charlotte ?— “ And I like his lay . ”</p>

     <l n="5">Is human life a pleasant game</l>
     <l n="6">That gives a palm to all ?</l>
     <l n="7">A fight for fortune , or for fame ?</l>
     <l n="8">A struggle , and a fall ?</l>
     <l n="9">Who views the Past , and all he prized ,</l>
     <l n="10">With tranquil exultation ?</l>
     <l n="11">And who can say , I 've realised</l>

     <l n="13">Alas , not one ! for rest assured</l>
     <l n="14">That all are prone to quarrel</l>
     <l n="15">With Fate , when worms destroy their gourd ,</l>
     <l n="16">Or mildew spoils their laurel :</l>
     <l n="17">The prize may come to cheer our lot ,</l>
     <l n="18">But all too late — and granted</l>

     <l n="21">My school-boy time ! I wish to praise</l>
     <l n="22">That bud of brief existence ,</l>
     <l n="23">The vision of my youthful days</l>
     <l n="24">Now trembles in the distance .</l>
     <l n="25">An envious vapour lingers here ,</l>
     <l n="26">And there I find a chasm ;</l>
     <l n="27">But much remains , distinct and clear ,</l>
     <l n="28">To sink enthusiasm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="29">Such thoughts just now disturb my soul</l>
     <l n="30">With reason good — for lately</l>
     <l n="31">I took the train to Marley-knoll ,</l>
     <l n="32">And crossed the fields to Mately .</l>
     <l n="33">I found old Wheeler at his gate ,</l>
     <l n="34">Who used rare sport to show me :</l>
     <l n="35">My Mentor once on snares and bait —</l>
     <l n="36">But Wheeler did not know me .</l>

     <l n="37">“ Goodlord ! ” at last exclaimed the churl ,</l>

     <l n="39">What used to train his hair in curl ,</l>
     <l n="40">And wore a scarlet cap , sir ? ”</l>
     <l n="41">And then he fell to fill in blanks ,</l>
     <l n="42">And conjure up old faces ;</l>
     <l n="43">And talk of well-remembered pranks ,</l>
     <l n="44">In half forgotten places .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="45">It pleased the man to tell his brief</l>
     <l n="46">And somewhat mournful story ,</l>
     <l n="47">Old Bliss 's school had come to grief —</l>
     <l n="48">And Bliss had “ gone to glory . ”</l>
     <l n="49">His trees were felled , his house was razed —</l>
     <l n="50">And what less keenly pained me ,</l>
     <l n="51">A venerable donkey grazed</l>
     <l n="52">Exactly where he caned me .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="53">And where have all my playmates sped ,</l>
     <l n="54">Whose ranks were once so serried ?</l>
     <l n="55">Why some are wed , and some are dead ,</l>
     <l n="56">And some are only buried ;</l>
     <l n="57">Frank Petre , erst so full of fun ,</l>
     <l n="58">Is now St. Blaise 's prior —</l>
     <l n="59">And Travers , the attorney 's son ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="61">Dame Fortune , that inconstant jade ,</l>
     <l n="62">Can smile when least expected ,</l>
     <l n="63">And those who languish in the shade ,</l>
     <l n="64">Need never be dejected .</l>
     <l n="65">Poor Pat , who once did nothing right ,</l>
     <l n="66">Has proved a famous writer ;</l>
     <l n="67">While Mat “ shirked prayers ” ( with all his might ! )</l>
     <l n="68">And wears , withal , his mitre .</l>

     <l n="69">Dull maskers we ! Life 's festival</l>
     <l n="70">Enchants the blithe new-comer ;</l>
     <l n="71">But seasons change , and where are all</l>
     <l n="72">These friendships of our summer ?</l>
     <l n="73">Wan pilgrims flit athwart our track —</l>
     <l n="74">Cold looks attend the meeting —</l>
     <l n="75">We only greet them , glancing back ,</l>
     <l n="76">Or pass without a greeting !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="77">I owe old Bliss some rubs , but pride</l>
     <l n="78">Constrains me to postpone ‘ em ,</l>
     <l n="79">He taught me something , ‘ ere he died ,</l>
     <l n="80">About nil nisi bonum .</l>
     <l n="81">I 've met with wiser , better men ,</l>
     <l n="82">But I forgive him wholly ;</l>
     <l n="83">Perhaps his jokes were sad — but then</l>
     <l n="84">He used to storm so drolly .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="85">I still can laugh , is still my boast ,</l>
     <l n="86">But mirth has sounded gayer ;</l>
     <l n="87">And which provokes my laughter most —</l>
     <l n="88">The preacher , or the player ?</l>
     <l n="89">Alack , I cannot laugh at what</l>
     <l n="90">Once made us laugh so freely ,</l>
     <l n="91">For Nestroy and Grassot are not —</l>
     <l n="92">And where is Mr. Keeley ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="93">O , shall I run away from hence ,</l>

     <l n="96">Forbid that I should do so .</l>
     <l n="97">I 'd sooner dress your Little Miss</l>
     <l n="98">As Paulet shaves his poodles !</l>
     <l n="99">As soon propose for Betsy Bliss —</l>
     <l n="100">Or get proposed for Boodle 's .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="101">We prate of Life 's illusive dyes ,</l>
     <l n="102">Yet still fond Hope enchants us ;</l>
     <l n="103">We all believe we near the prize ,</l>
     <l n="104">Till some fresh dupe supplants us !</l>
     <l n="105">A bright reward , forsooth ! And though</l>
     <l n="106">No mortal has attained it ,</l>
     <l n="107">I still can hope , for well I know</l>

     <l n="1">What changes greet my wistful eyes</l>
     <l n="2">In quiet little Bramble-Rise ,</l>
     <l n="3">Once smallest of its shire ?</l>
     <l n="4">How altered is each pleasant nook !</l>
     <l n="5">The dumpy church used not to look</l>
     <l n="6">So dumpy in the spire .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">This village is no longer mine ;</l>
     <l n="8">And though the Inn has changed its sign ,</l>
     <l n="9">The beer may not be stronger :</l>
     <l n="10">The river , dwindled by degrees ,</l>
     <l n="11">Is now a brook ,— the cottages</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">The thatch is slate , the plaster bricks ,</l>

     <l n="15">Or else the sticks are stunted :</l>
     <l n="16">I 'm sure these thistles once grew figs ,</l>
     <l n="17">These geese were swans , and once these pigs</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">Where early reapers whistled , shrill</l>

     <l n="21">The locomotive 's ravings .</l>
     <l n="22">New custom newer want begets ,—</l>
     <l n="23">My bank of early violets</l>

    <p n="1">NOTE TO “ A HUMAN SKULL . ”</p>
    <p n="2">“ In our last month 's Magazine you may remember there were some verses about a portion of a skeleton . Did you remark how the poet and present proprietor of the human skull at once settled the sex of it , and determined off-hand that it must have belonged to a woman ? Such skulls are locked up in many gentlemen 's hearts and memories . Bluebeard , you know , had a whole museum of them — as that imprudent little last wife of his found out to her cost . And , on the other hand , a lady , we suppose , would select hers of the sort which had carried beards when in the flesh . ” — The Adventures of Philip on his Way through the World . Cornhill Magazine , January , 1861 .</p>
    <p n="3">NOTE TO “ AN INVITATION TO ROME . ”</p>
    <p n="4">“ He never sends a letter to her , but he begins a new one on the same day . He can n't bear to let go her kind little hand as it were . He knows that she is thinking of him , and longing for him far away in Dublin yonder . ” — English Humourists of the Eighteenth Century .</p>
    <p n="5">NOTE TO “ TO MY MISTRESS . ”</p>
    <p n="6">“ M. Deschanel quotes the following charming little poem , by Corneille , addressed to a young lady who had not been quite civil to him . He says with truth — ‘ Le sujet est leger , le rhythme court , mais on y retrouve la fierte de l'homme , et aussi l'ampleur du tragique . ’ The verses are probably new to our readers . They are well worth reading :—</p>
    <p n="7">Marquise , si mon visage A quelques traits un peu vieux , Souvenez-vous , qu'a mon age Vous ne vaudrez guere mieux .</p>
    <p n="8">Le temps aux plus belles choses Se plait a faire un affront , Et saura faner vos roses Comme il a ride mon front .</p>
    <p n="9">Le meme cours des planetes Regle nos jours et nos nuits ; On m'a vu ce que vous etes , Vous serez ce que je suis .</p>
    <p n="10">Cependant j'ai quelques charmes Qui sont assez eclatants Pour n'avoir pas trop d'alarmes De ces ravages du temps .</p>
    <p n="11">Vous en avez qu'on adore , Mais ceux que vous meprisez Pourraient bien durer encore Quand ceux-la seront uses .</p>
    <p n="12">Ils pourront sauver la gloire Des yeux qui me semblent doux , Et dans mille ans faire croire Ce qu'il me plaira de vous .</p>
    <p n="13">Chez cette race nouvelle Ou j'aurai quelque credit , Vous ne passerez pour belle Qu'autant que je l'aurai dit .</p>
    <p n="14">Pensez-y , belle Marquise , Quoiqu'un grison fasse effroi , Il vaut qu'on le courtise Quand il est fait comme moi .</p>
    <p n="15">The last four stanzas in particular are brimful of spirit , and the mixture of pride and vanity which they display is so remarkable that it seems impossible that it should have ever occurred in more than one person . ” — Saturday Review , July 23rd , 1864 .</p>
    <p n="16">NOTE TO “ THE ROSE AND THE RING . ”</p>
    <p n="17">Mr. Thackeray spent a portion of the winter of 1854 in Rome , and while there he wrote his little Christmas story called “ The Rose and the Ring . ” He was a great friend of the distinguished American sculptor , Mr. Story , and was a frequent visitor at his house . I have heard Mr. Story speak with emotion of the kindness of Mr. Thackeray to his little daughter , then recovering from a severe illness , and he told me that Mr. Thackeray used to come nearly every day to read to Miss Story , often bringing portions of his manuscript with him .</p>
    <p n="18">Five or six years afterwards Miss Story showed me a very pretty copy of “ The Rose and the Ring , ” which Mr. Thackeray had sent her , with a facetious sketch of himself in the act of presenting her with the work .</p>
    <p n="19">NOTE TO “ BERANGER . ”</p>
    <p n="20">Jete sur cette boule , Laid , chetif , et souffrant ; Etouffe dans la foule , Faute d'etre assez grand ;</p>
    <p n="21">Une plainte touchante De ma bouche sortit ; Le bon Dieu me dit : Chante , Chante , pauvre petit !</p>
    <p n="22">Chanter , ou je m'abuse , Est ma tache ici-bas . Tous ceux qu'ainsi j'amuse , Ne m'aimeronthYpppHeNils pas ?</p>
    <p n="23">NOTE TO “ GLYCERE . ”</p>
    <p n="24">Un Vieillard . Jeune fille au riant visage , Que cherches-tu sous cet ombrage ? La Jeune Fille . Des fleurs pour orner mes cheveux . Je me rends au prochain village . Avec le printemps et ses feux , Bergeres , bergers amoureux Vont danser sur l'herbe nouvelle . Deja le sistre les appelle : Glycere est sans doute avec eux . De ces hameaux c'est la plus belle ; Je veux l'effacer a leurs yeux : Voyez ces fleurs , c'est un presage .</p>
    <p n="25">Le Vieillard . Sais-tu quel est ce lieu sauvage ?</p>
    <p n="26">La Jeune Fille . Non , et tout m'y semble nouveau .</p>
    <p n="27">Le Vieillard . La repose , jeune etrangere , La plus belle de ce hameau . Ces fleurs pour effacer Glycere Tu les cueilles sur son tombeau !</p>
