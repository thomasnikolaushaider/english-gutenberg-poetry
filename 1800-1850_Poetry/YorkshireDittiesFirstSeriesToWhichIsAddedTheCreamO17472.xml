    <head>Introduction</head>
    <p n="1">As the First Volume of the Yorkshire Ditties has been for some time out of print , and as there is a great demand for the very humorous productions of Mr. Hartley 's pen , it has been decided to reprint that Volume , and also a Second One ; both to be considerably enlarged and enriched by Selections from Mr. Hartley 's other humorous writings .</p>
   </div>
   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>The Publishers would also intimate that for this purpose they have purchased of Mr. Hartley the copyright of the DITTIES , and other Pieces appended to each Volume . The Publishers presume that both Volumes will , on account of their great humour , be favourably received by the Public .</docImprint>

       <l n="1">The New Year</l>
     </lg>
     <p>What a charm ther is abaat owt new ; whether it 's a new year or a new waist-coit . Aw sometimes try to fancy what sooart ov a world ther 'd be if ther wor nowt new .</p>
     <p>Solomon sed ther wor nowt new under th ’ sun ; an ’ he owt to know if onybody did . Maybe he wor reight if we luk at it i ’ some ways , but aw think it 's possible to see it in another leet . If ther wor nowt new , ther 'd be nowt to hooap for — nowt to live for but to dee ; an ’ we should lang for that time to come just for th ’ sake ov a change . Ha anxiously a little child looks forrard to th ’ time when he 's to have a new toy , an ’ ha he prizes it at furst when he 's getten it : but in a while he throws it o ’ one side an ’ cries fur summat new . Ha he langs to be as big as his brother , soa 's he can have a new bat an ’ ball ; an ’ his brother langs for th ’ time when he can leeave schooil an ’ goa work for his livin ’ ; an ’ varry likely his fayther 's langin ’ for th ’ time when he can live withaat workin ’ — all on ‘ em langin for summat new . Langill ’ for things new does n't prevent us lovin ’ things at 's owd . Who is n't praad ov ther owd fayther , as he sits i ’ tharm-cheer an ’ tells long tales abaat what he can remember bein ’ new ? An ’ who does n't feel a soothin ’ kind ov a feelin ’ come ovver him when his mother 's kindly warnin ’ falls on his ear , as shoo tells him “ what-iver he does , net to be soa fond ov ivery thing new ? ” What a love fowk get for “ th ’ owd haase ; ” but ther 's moor o'th ’ past nor o'th ’ futur ’ i ’ these feelin 's , they 're not hopeful , an ’ its hopeful feelin 's at keeps th ’ world a goin ’ , its hooap at maks us keep o'th ’ look aat for summat fresh .</p>
     <p>Aw 've heeard fowk wish for things to keep just as they are , they say they dooant want owt new . What a mistak ’ they mak ! They 're wishin ’ for what ud be th ’ mooast of a novelty . Things will n't stop as they are , an ’ it wod n't be reight if they did . It 's all weel enuff for them at 's feathered ther nest to feel moderate contented , but them at 's sufferin ’ for want ov a meal 's mait are all hopin ’ for a change for th ’ better . Owd hats an ’ owd slippers are generally more comfortable nor new ens , an ’ fowk “ wish they 'd niver be done , ” — “ they hate owt new ” — as if it wod n't be summat new if they could wear ‘ em withaat ‘ em bein ’ done . Young fowk are allus moor anxious for changes nor owd fowk , its likely enuff ; like a child wi ’ a pictur book , watch him turn ovver two or three leaves at th ’ beginnin ’ , see ha delighted he is ; but in a while he turns ovver moor carelessly , an ’ befoor he gets to th ’ end he leaves it , wearied with its variety , or falls hard asleep opposite one at wod have fascinated him when he began . Life 's nobbut a pictur ’ book ov another sooart , at th ’ beginnin ’ we 're delighted wi ’ ivery fresh leeaf , an ’ we keep turnin ’ ovver till at last we get wearied , an ’ had rayther sit quietly looking at one . But we cannot stop , we ha ’ to goo throo th ’ book whether we like it or net , until at last we shut us een an ’ fall asleep over summat new .</p>

     <p>Ha monny young folk are langin for th ’ fourteenth o ’ February ! An ha mony old pooastmen wish it ud niver come ? Sawr owd maids an ’ crusty owd bachelors wonder ‘ at fowk should have noa moor sense nor to waste ther brass on sich like nonsense . But it 's noa use them talkin ’ , for young fowk have done it befoor time , an ’ as long as it 's i'th ’ natur on ‘ em to love one another an ’ get wed , soa long will valentine makers have plenty to do at this time o'th ’ year . Ther 's monny a daycent sooart of a young chap at thinks he could like to mak up to a young lass at he 's met at th ’ chapel or some other place , but as sooin as he gets at th ’ side on her , he caant screw his courage up to th ’ stickin ’ place , an ’ he axes her some sooart ov a gaumless question , sich as “ ha 's your mother , ” or summat he cares noa moor abaat . An ’ as sooin as he gets to hissell he 's fit to pail his heead agean th ’ jaumstooan for bien sich a fooil . Well , nah , what can sich a chap do ? Why , send her a valentine ov coorse . Soa he gooas an ’ buys her one wi ’ a grand piece ov poetry like this :—</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ The rose is red , the violet 's blue ,</l>
       <l n="2">The pink is sweet , and so are you . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>It is n't to be expected ‘ at shoo can tell whear it 's come throo ; but shoo could guess at twice , an guess puddin ’ once , that 's the beauty on it . Then th ’ way 's oppen 'd aat at once , he 's gein her to understand what ten to one shoo understood long afoor he did . Next time they meet shoo 's sure to ax him if he gate ony valentines , an ’ then he 'll smile an ’ say , “ What for , did yo ? ” An ’ shoo 'll show him th ’ direction , an ’ ax him if he knows who 's writing that is ? An ’ he 'll luk at it as sackless as if he did n't know it wor his own — ther heeads get cloise together , an ’ shoo sighs an ’ he sighs , an ’ then , if ther 's noabody abaat he 'll give hur a smack with his lips an ’ lawp back as if he 'd burned th ’ skin off ‘ em , an ’ shooo axes him ha he con fashion to goa on like that , he owt to be ashamed ov his face ? An ’ all th ’ time shoo 's wonderin ’ why he niver did it afoor . Then , if ther 's owt abaat him , it is n't long befoor ther 's a weddin ’ , an ’ then he 's begun life . He 's settled into his nook i'th ’ world , an ’ he feels he 's a man . Troubles come , but then ther 's a pleasure i ’ bein able to maister ‘ em . He 's summat to wark for besides his own belly an ’ back . He 's a heart-expandin ’ responsibility put on him . His country benefits by him , for a man does moor for his country ‘ at leaves ten weel-trained sons an ’ dowters nor him ‘ at leaves ten thaasand paand . Then if sich a little simple thing as a valentine can help a chap on his rooad in lite , aw say .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>These winds blow rayther strong — stronger sometimes nor what feels pleasant . Ther 's monny a chap has a race wi ’ his hat , an ’ it luks a sheepish sooart ov a trick , an ’ iverybody can affooard to laff at him just becoss it is n't them . But for all that aw alus think at th ’ year 's niver getten a reight start till after March . It 's like as if it comes blusterin ’ an ’ rooarin ’ , just o ’ purpose to put things into reight trim . It fotches daan th ’ owd watter spaats , an ’ lets fowk know whear ther 's a slate at 's shakey . It gives th ’ trees a bit ov a whisk raand an ’ wuthers abaat as if it wor detarmined to clear all th ’ maase nooks aat , an ’ give us a fair start for th ’ fine weather . But that is n't all it does ; it finds aat if yo 've ony owd teeth ‘ at 's rayther tender , ( an ’ if ther 's owt i'th ’ world at ‘ ll wear aat a chap 's patience its th ’ tooith wark . Its bad enuff , but what maks it war to bide is , iverybody can tell yo ha to cure it , an ’ for all that they wor as fast what to do wi ’ it when they had it as onybody else . ) But what does it matter if it does find aat bits o ’ waik spots , there 's nowt like knowin whear they are , for then yo do stand a chonce o ’ bein ’ able to tak care on ‘ em . But it does summat else beside — it brings a fine day or two — an ’ th ’ grass begins to luk a trifle greener , an ’ here an ’ thear i ’ bits o ’ shady nooks an ’ corners sometimes yo can find a daisy or two ; an ’ what is ther luks bonnier nor th ’ first daisy yo find peepin up ? It may be a bit ov a pindered lookin thing , but its a daisy ; an ’ aw dooant think at th ’ grandest yo 'll find all th ’ year ‘ ll please yo hauf as weel as this . Little children clap ther hands when they see it , becoss it tells ‘ em ther 's some fine weather comin ’ bye an ’ bye ; an ’ they pluck it to tak hooam wi ’ em ’ to show ther mother ; an ’ ther grandfayther smiles when he sees it , for it whispers a bit o ’ comfort to him , an ’ tells him to cheer up ! for th ’ time o'th ’ year 's comin ’ when he 'll be able to goa aat o'th ’ door an ’ sit o'th green grass , an ’ hear th ’ burds sing , an ’ let th ’ sun shine on his face , an ’ he will n't be feeard o ’ bringin ’ th ’ rhumatic back wi ’ him ; an ’ takkin it altogether it 's one o ’ th ’ mooast pleasin ’ things i ’ th ’ year is findin ’ a daisy i ’ March . It 's strange ha folk alter in a few years time . Luk at a child when its abaat five or six years owd — see ha delighted it is wi ’ a gurt bunch ov innocent lukkin ’ buttercups an ’ daisies . Noatice th ’ same child when he 's getten fourteen or fifteen years owd . He could n't fashion to be seen carryin ’ a bunch . See him agean when he 's a man . He 's noa time for daisies then . What 's th ’ reason ? Daisies are as bonny nah as iver they wor . Ther is a difference somewhear , but it is n't i'th ’ daisies .</p>

Aw 've monny a time thowt when aw 've heared fowk settin a chap daan as a fooil ;— talk prattley — may be if he wor weighed up he 's a better man nor yo this minit ; yo connot tell all ‘ at he may have had to struggle wi ’ —</p>

     <p>An ’ it 's as weel to exercise a bit ov charity towards them ‘ at 's set daan to be fooils . “ Young fowk think old fowk fooils , an ’ old fowk 's sure young uns is . ” An aw believe th ’ old fowk are oft varry near th ’ mark ,— for th ’ experience of a life time is little moor nor livin to know what fooils we 've been ; an ’ if iver aw meet wi ’ a chap ‘ at can n't remember iver makkin a fooil ov hissen , aw shall expect to hear tell on ’ him bein ta'en to th ’ blue slates directly . Poor Richard says , “ Experience is a dear schooil , but fooils will leearn i ’ noa other ; ” an ’ who is ther ‘ at has n't had to leearn i ’ that schooil ? Its a hard maister , an ’ we 're apt to think , when we 're under him , ‘ at he 's war wi ’ us nor onybody else ; but when we 've getten th ’ lessen off by heart we find th ’ advantage on it . But ov all th ’ fooils it has been my luck to meet wi , ’ them chaps ‘ at knows all are th ’ biggest . There 's some fowk think they 're born wi ’ all th ’ wit i'th world , an ’ noabody can taich ‘ em owt ; whativer yo tell ’ em , they 've allus “ known that long enuff sin ’ , ” or else they 've “ just been think in soa . ” Aw once knew one o ’ that Sooart — one ‘ at had allus been thinkin soa . One day some mates o ’ mine an ’ me thowt we cud like a marlock wi ’ him , an soa we gooas up to him an says , “ A'a Jooanas ! whativer does ta think ? ” “ Nay , ” he says , “ whativer will yo say ? What 's up ? ” “ Why , ” aw says , “ Jim Hyn 's dunkey 's swallow 'd th ’ grinelstooan . ” “ Well , if aw had n't just been thinkin soa , ” says Jooanas . “ Well , but tha thowt wrang , owd boy , this time , ” aw says , “ for it has n't . ” “ Why , ” he said , “ aw hardly thowt it had . ” Soa he had us at booath ends . They say it taks a wise man to mak a fooil , but aw think ther 's enuff withaat makkin ony moor , an aw niver knew a fooil i ’ my life at did n't think ivery body else a little bit war cracked nor hissen .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>Tawkin abaat policemen reminds me ov a mess one on ‘ em gate into a while sin . Aw shall n't tell awther his name or his number , becoss it 's net my wish to get ony body into trouble . It 's enuff for me to say he 's a gooid-lukkin chap , an ’ if he is n't wed his wife is . He wor on neet duty , an ’ at one o ’ th ’ haases he had to pass , lived a fine buxom sarvent . Policemen have allus been nooated for havin a fancy for sarvents , an ’ this wor like th ’ rest , an ’ befoor long they grew soa friendly ‘ at shoo used to invite him in after th ’ maister an ’ th ’ mistress had gooan to bed . One neet he 'd crept in , an ’ they wor whisperin varry lovinly together , when shoo tell 'd him ther wor noa cold mait o ’ ony sooart . “ Awm glad on it , ” he sed , “ for awm stoled o ’ cold stuff . That luks a bit o ’ nice bacon at 's hung up , does ta think tha could do me a bit anent th ’ fire , aw think ther 's as mich heeat as 'll cook it ? ”</p>
     <p>“ Well , Robert , ” shoo sed , “ if yo 'll sit daan an ’ wait awl try . ”</p>
     <p>Soa he put his lantern onto th ’ table an ’ sat daan wol shoo gate a little dutch oven an hooked two nice collops in ; but shoo fancied shoo could enjoy one hersen , soa shoo stept up into a cheer to cut off another , an ’ as shoo 'd th ’ knife i ’ one hand an ’ cannel i ’ th ’ tother shoo ovverbalanced hersen , and fell onto th ’ floor , settin up sich a skrike as yo niver heeard . Th ’ ‘ cannel went aat when it fell an all wor as dark as pitch , and Robert hearin th ’ maister skutterin daan th ’ stairs thowt his best plan wor to hook it ; soa he grab 'd up his lantern for owt he knew an buckled it on as he wor hurryin up th ’ steps . He 'd hardly left when th ’ maister runs aat in his shirt , callin aat , “ Police ! police ! ” Robert comes fussin on as if he knew nowt abaat it , an ’ went back wi ’ th ’ maister , who wor soa freetened wol he dar n't spaik .</p>
     <p>When they went in th ’ sarvent had sam 'd hersen up , an lit th ’ cannel agean ; but th ’ lass forgate her fall an ’ th ’ maister his fright , when they lukd at th ’ policeman an ’ saw he 'd getten th ’ dutch oven i ’ th ’ front on him astead ov his lantern , an ’ two bacon collops swingin in it .</p>
     <p>They settled th ’ matter amang thersens , but it towt that policeman niver to tak off his lantern until he 'd done wi ’ it .</p>

     <p>Watterin Places</p>
     <p>July is th ’ month to gooa a spawin ’ ; an ’ fowk luk forrard to it just th ’ same as if they conld n't do withaat it . Th ’ fact is aw hardly dar say owt agean it , for awm fond ov a bit ov a off mysen ; but then ther 's different ways o ’ dooin it . A chap at gethers horsemuck at hooam need n't want to mak ’ fowk believe he 's th ’ Lord Mayor o ’ London abrooad . Aw remember once when aw wur at a watterin ’ place , aw followed some fine young ladies an ’ wished ‘ em “ gooid day ; ” aw wornt exactly sure whether one on ‘ em might n't be th ’ Princess o ’ Wales or net , but haasumiver , they curled up ther nooas th ’ same as if they 'd passed a fooamet . But in abaat a wick at after , aw met one on ‘ em gooin ovver th ’ North Brigg wi ’ a slice o ’ traitle cake in her hand , varry near like th ’ door ov a mahogany shut-up-bed , an ’ up to th ’ elbows i ’ Miln greease too . Aw thowt if ony body wanted to pick a lass for a wife they should n't goa to a spawin ’ spot . For all that , awve nowt to say agean it — one body 's as mich reight to goa an get sunburnt as another ; but they mud as weel spaik truth , an ’ not allus say it 's for th ’ gooid o ’ ther health , when all th ’ time it 's just for a bit ov a spree . Aw could give some gooid advice to ony body at thinks o ’ gooin . Tak varry little brass , an ’ let it be i ’ your pocket , net i ’ yor face . Th ’ less yo have an ’ th ’ less yo 'll spend . Dooant buy patent booits to walk o ’ th ’ sand in . If you 're anxious to ride in a cock booat , dooant be particler to wear white trowsers . If yo want a horse to ride , tak one wi yo — it ‘ ll save yo a deeal o ’ disappointment ; if yo want a donkey , settle ha mony legs yo could like it to have , an ’ yo 'll find plenty . Be careful noabody taks a fancy to yo th ’ same way . Ther 's as mony donkeys wi ’ two legs as four , an ’ a bonny seet mooar . Talkin ’ abaat th ’ number o ’ legs maks me think ov a chap at considered hissen rayther a sharp en ; he 'd a bit ov a garden an ’ some cherry trees in it , an ’ one mornin ’ when he gate aat o ’ bed he fan somdy had saved him th ’ trouble o ’ getherin ’ th ’ fruit ; they 'd done it for him woll he wor asleep . He coom an ’ tell 'd th ’ tale to me . “ A'a , ” he said , “ if he could nobbut find aat who 'd done it , he 'd stransport ‘ em over th ’ seah ’ that he wod ! ” “ Why , ” aw says , “ tha knows burds is varry fond o ’ cherries , an ’ its happen th ’ burds . ” “ Burds ! ” he said , an ’ he winked at me varry knowingly . “ Burds ! happen they wor burds — but they wor two-legged ens aw 'll bet . ” Aw niver thowt him quite so sharp after that .</p>
     <p>Nah just a word bi way of a caution . A chap ‘ at 's two paand i ’ debt an ’ goas an ’ spends three paand at a watterin ’ place , maks hiss en five paand behund ; whereas if he 'd paid what he owed he 'd still ha had one paand to spend , an ’ that ud goa as far o ’ th ’ top o ’ Blackstonedge as three paand at Blackpool . It 's worth a thowt .</p>

     <p>When ther 's a flaar show , clooas show at th ’ same time . Aw hear fowk tawk abaat “ floral gems , ” and sich like stuff , but aw understand varry little abaat it . But aw 've a few gems ov another sooart at sich times — aw call ‘ em gems o ’ thowt . Aw 'm allus wonderin . Aw wonder a deal aw 've noa business to wonder .

Aw mony a time wonder , when aw hear th ’ bands o ’ music strike up , what Lord Byron ment when he said , “ When music arose with its voluptuous swell ; ” for aw 've booath seen an ’ heeard monny a voluptuous swell at a flaar show . An ’ aw wonder sometimes ha it is ‘ at fowk ‘ at goa wi a shawl o ’ ther heead to pick aat a sheep heead i'th ’ market , can n't be content unless they 're donned i ’ silks an ’ satins to goa see a twoathree marrygolds an ’ fushias . An ’ sometimes aw wonder ‘ what i'th ’ name o ’ fortun aw 'm dooin thear mysen , an ’ if anybody axes me , aw wonder what business it is o ’ their 's ;— an ’ its just a case o ’ wonderin throo beginnin to th ’ endin ’ , an ’ aw wonder when fowk ‘ ll leearn a bit o ’ wit .

       <l n="1">October Ale</l>
     </lg>
     <p>They reckon to brew a gooid sup o ’ ale in October , an ’ they call it “ Prime owd October . ” Ther 's monny a war thing i'th ’ world nor a sup o ’ gooid drink . Landlords an ’ teetotal-lecturers manage to get a livin ’ aat on it some way ;— but it 's th ’ same wi ’ ale as wi ’ iverything else nah days ,— it 's nowt made on unless it 's sharp . It 's a sharp age we live in ;— hand-loom waivin ’ an ’ stage coaches are all too slow ; iverybody an ’ iverything keeps growin ’ sharper . But we ar n't as sharp as what they are i ’ ‘ Merica yet — they 're too sharp . They tell me they ha ’ to lapp thersen up i ’ haybands afoor they goa to bed , for fear o ’ cuttin ’ th ’ sheets . Aw heeard tell o ’ one chap runnin ’ a race wi ’ a flash o ’ leetnin ’ , an ’ they say he 'd ha ’ won but for one ov his gallus buttons comin ’ off . An ’ another ‘ at used to mak leather garters an ’ throw ‘ em ovver his heead , an ’ he could mak ‘ em soa sharp ‘ at he allus kept one pair flyin ’ . He wor n't a bad hand at his job , he wor n't that . One day aw axed a chap ‘ at had been , “ if they wor raylee as sharp as what fowk gave ‘ em credit for ? ” “ Why , ” he says , “ they wor sharper nor aw liked on , or else aw should n't ha ’ come back ; but aw could n't get on noa rooad : aw tried two or three different trades , but aw made nowt aat , an ’ at last aw set up as tubthumper ; but that wod n't do . They niver wanted ought makkin ’ — they wor too sharp for that ; they allus brought yo summat to mend ;— becoss they knew a chap could n't charge as mich for mendin ’ an owd tub as for makkin ’ a new en ; soa if they 'd ony sooart ov a owd tub lagg , or a piece of a barrel bottom , they browt it to get mended into a new tub . Aw did as weel as aw could amang it ; but one day a chap comes in an ’ says , ‘ Aw want yo to do a bit o ’ repairin ’ for me . ’ ‘ Varry gooid , sur , ’ says aw , ‘ an ’ what might yo be wantin ? ’ ‘ Well , ’ he says , ‘ aw 've an owd bung hoil here , do yo think yo could fit me a fresh barrel to it ? ’ Aw niver spake for a minit , then aw says , ‘ wod yo be gooid enuff to lend me a hand to put theas shuts up ? ’ ‘ Wi ’ pleasure , sur , ’ he said , an ’ he did , an ’ aw left th ’ job an ’ coom hooam , for aw thowt they wor rayther too sharp . ” Mun , a chap can be too sharp sometimes . My advice is , be as sharp as yo like , if yo 're sharp in a reight way , but thers some things it 's as weel to be slow abaat . Be slow to do a shabby trick , an ’ be sharp to help a poor body ‘ at needs it . Be slow to see other fowk 's faults , an ’ be sharp to improve yor own . Be slow to scandalise yor neighbors , an ’ keep a sharp luk aat to steer clear ov iverybody else 's business ; yo 'll find it ‘ ll give yo moor time to luk after yor own .</p>

     <p>Squibs an ’ crackers ! Starleets an ’ catterin wheels ! Bunfires an ’ traikle parkin ! This is th ’ time for a bit ov a jollification . Guy Fawkes did a gooid turn , after all , when he tried to blow th ’ Parliament haase up ; for we should ha ’ had one spree less i ’ the ’ year but for him . Ax twenty fowk this question o ’ th ’ fourth o ’ November , “ Are yo gooin to buy ony fireworks this year ? ” an aw dar be bun to say yo will n't find one i'th ’ lot but what 'll say “ Aw 've summat else to do wi ’ my brass nor to waste it o ’ sich like fooilery as that . ” An ’ still , aw 'll wager at nineteen on ‘ em buy some after all . Ther 's a deal o ’ difference i'th way they spend it . I ’ th ’ country they all sit raand th ’ fire wi ’ their parkin an ’ milk ’ or else rooasted puttaties , an ’ they tell tales , an ’ they laf an ’ talk till they 've varry near burned ther shoo toas off , an ’ getten soa starved o ’ ther back ‘ at they will n't be shut ov a cold for a month ; but i'th ’ taan there 's allus th ’ mooast to do i'th ’ public haases . Aw think aw shall niver forget a marlock we had th ’ last plot . It wor in a public haase somewhere between “ Spice Cake-loin ” an ’ Whiskum Dandy ; ther wor a raam full o ’ fowk , an ’ aw nooatised ‘ at iverybody 's pockets wor swelled aat , an ’ thinks aw , aw should n't be capp 'd if ther wor a dust here in a while . They just wanted somdy to start . In a bit one on ‘ em gate up to goa aat , an ’ th ’ landlord ( he 'd a cork leg ) drop 'd a cracker into his pocket . He had n't gooan far when bang it went ; he turns back an ’ leets abaat two dozzen an ’ sends ‘ em in to th ’ middle o'th ’ raam . “ Nah , lads ! for God 's sake show a bit o ’ sense , ” says th ’ landlord , “ dooant begin sich like wark as that i ’ this raam , nah dooant . ” He mud as weel ha ’ just whistled jigs to a mile-stoop ; aat coom iverybody 's stock , an ’ i ’ less nor hauf a minit ther wor sich a hullabaloo i ’ that shop as aw niver heeared afoor . To mak matters war , somdy had shut th ’ door an ’ fesened it , an ’ th ’ place wor full o ’ rick , an iverybody ommost chooak 'd . Aw gate under th ’ seat , an ’ in a bit somdy smashes th ’ window an ’ bawls aat “ fire ! fire ! ” I ’ two or three minits ther coom a stream o ’ watter into th ’ raam as thick as my shackle , an ’ smash went th ’ chandilleer . Th ’ landlord wor mad ommost — lukkin glasses an ’ picters went one after tother , an ’ aw faand aat ‘ as aw could n't swim , aw should ha ’ to shift , or else aw should be draaned . Some kind soul managed to braik th ’ door daan an ’ we gate aat , but aw could hear th ’ landlord yelling aat ‘ at sombdy had stown his cork leg . Ha ’ they went on aw dooant know , for aw steered straight hooam . At abaat six o'clock th ’ next morning , as aw went to my wark , aw saw a cork leg with a varry good booit on it , hangin ’ to a gas lamp , an aw wonder 'd whose it wor .</p>

     <p>Th ’ last month o ’ th ’ year ; an ’ ther 's summat rayther sorrowful abaat th ’ last o ’ owt , exceptin ’ trouble ; an ’ still to me ther 's allus summat varry interestin ’ abaat owt at 's “ th ’ last . ” Aw 've watched men when they 've been buildin ’ a long chimley , but aw 've niver felt mich interest till it 's come th ’ time for ‘ em to put on th ’ last stooan ; they 've labored day by day , riskin boath life an ’ limb , an ’ still aw 've felt varry little anxiety ; but it 's just th ’ fact on it bein ’ th ’ last stooan ; an ’ aw 've hardly been able to tak my een off it till it 's been finished an ’ th ’ last man 's come safe daan . But still it 's a sorrowful saandin ’ word is “ last . ” Th ’ last farewell — th ’ last look — th ’ last breath — an ’ th ’ last restin , place ; it sets fowk thinkin what there 'll be after “ th ’ last . ” Th ’ last month i'th ’ year is n't a bad time to luk back an ’ see ha we 've spent th ’ past eleven , an ’ aw think ther 's few but what 'll be able to see monny a place where they 've missed it . An ’ if soa we 'd better mak th ’ best o'th ’ few days left to mak what amends we can . Owd Christmas comes in smilin ’ , with his holly an ’ his mistletoe , an ’ his gooid tempered face surraanded wi ’ steam of plum puddin ’ an ’ roast beef — tables get tested what weight they can bear — owd fowk an ’ young ens exchange greetin 's , punch bowls steam up ; an ’ lemons an ’ nutmegs suffer theresen to be rubbed , scrubbed , sliced , an ’ stewed ; an ’ iverybody at can , seems to be jolly at Christmas . Some fowk luk forrard to Christmas just for th ’ sake of a gooid feed , an ’ aw 've seen odd ens , nah an ’ then , ‘ at can tuck it in i ’ fine style . Aw recollect one Christmas when Jooan o ’ Jenny 's ( we used to call him Jooan long stummack ) went to London ( he 'd one o'th ’ best twists aw iver met wi ’ ) , an ’ he wor takken varry wamley for want ov a bit ov a bitin on , soa he went into a cook 's shop an ’ ax 'd ‘ em ha mich they 'd mak him a dinner for ? “ Eighteenpence , sur , ” said th ’ maister , “ come , sit daan an ’ help thisen . ” Soa he sat daan just at th ’ front ov a lump o ’ rooast beef , an ’ cut a piece off as big as a brick , an ’ he wor n't lang i ’ polishin ’ that an ’ cutting another . Th ’ landlord wor rayther capped when he saw it goa like that , an ’ he says “ Tha'rt hungary , lad , aw think ! Will ta have , summat to sup ? ” “ Noa thank yo , sur , ” says Jooan , “ not just yet . ” He varry sooin put th ’ second lot where it could keep th ’ furst company , an ’ began cuttin ’ a third ; this made th ’ maister seem varry uneasy , an ’ he says , “ Tha 'd better have summat to sup , lad ! Mun aw fotch thi a pint o ’ drink ? ” “ Noa , thank yo , ” said Jooan , “ aw mak a practice niver to sup till aw 've hauf , done . ” “ Why , lad , ” says th ’ landlord , “ haitch will ta tak ’ to drop it ? ” “ Well ” said Jooan , “ if yo dooant like my company aw 'm sooary aw 've come , but aw should n't like to leave this table for less nor hauf a craan , if aw do aw shall be a loiser . ” Th ’ old chap pooled awt hauf a craan an ’ banged it on to th ’ table , an ’ says , “ Tak ’ it , an ’ tak ’ thisen away , an ’ niver put thi fooit i ’ my haase agean as long as tha 's a day to live ; tha 'd ruin me in a wick . ” “ Why , maister , ” he says , “ yo cap me sayin ’ soa , for aw can n't ait as mich bi a caah head as once aw cud . Aw 'll tak ’ th ’ hauf crawn ; gooid day , maister ; you 've made a shillin ‘ at me . ”</p>
     <p>Mediated Strike</p>
     <p>At a meeting of the tax-collectors of the W — -  R — - g of — - shire , held in one of the cells beneath the Town Hall it was proposed , “ That we , the tax gatherers and rate collectors of the W — -  R — - g of — - shire do intend to throw up our offices , unless our wages are reduced or our labours increased , for being like unto other men , possessed of consciences , we are frequently tormented with the thought , that we are receiving more than what is our due , and by that means wronging the public . ” Mr. Christopher Delphian moved as an amendment , “ that they should dispose of their consciences , that being a readier way of getting over the difficulty . ” The chairman put the amendment which was carried , and the consciences were sold in one lot , for 7 3 / 4 d ., which was carried to the fund for the entertainment of Mr. Calcraft , the president , whenever he should visit the district on a professional tour .</p>

     <p>Its net oft at aw have mich to do wi ’ parties . Th ’ fact is aw 'm wed , an ’ young fowk dooant want me , becoss they say aw 've made my markets , an ’ wed fowk dooant oft ax me becoss aw suppose aw dooant oft ax them . But this month last year aw did get a invite to a doo , an ’ aw went . Aw'st net forget in a hurry what a fidget my owd woman gate into . Shoo brushed me daan aboon a duzzen times , an ’ turned me raand like a rooastin jack to see ha aw luk 'd , woll aw wor as mazy as a wheel heead , an ’ th ’ childer luk 'd up i ’ my face two or three times afoor they could believe it wor me . Aw heeard awr Abram telling Betty ‘ at “ he believed his fayther wor gooin to get kursen 'd or summat . ” “ Ho eeah ! why what are they baan to call him ? ” shoo says . “ Nay , aw dooant know , but my mother 's been callin ’ him ‘ gaumless , ’ happen that 's it . ”</p>
     <p>Gaumless enuff aw thowt , an ’ after rubbin ’ my hat raand wi ’ a weet sponge ( woll th ’ wife declared it wor as hansum as a Japan tea caddy ) , aw set off . Aw seized howd o'th ’ nob when aw gate to th ’ door , an ’ aw gave a gooid pawse , same as aw do at hooam , A fine young gentleman oppen 'd it , an ’ after starin ’ at me for two or three minits , he said , “ Walk in , sur . ” Aw doff 'd my hat an ’ did soa ; an ’ he ! what a smell ! “ By gow , lad , ” aw said , “ its enuff to mak my maath watter is this , ther 's nowt awm fonder on nor onions , an ’ aw con smell ther 's some cookin ’ — they 'll be frying some liver , aw dar say . Are ta th ’ maister 's lad ? ” aw axed . “ Noa , sur , ” he said ; “ a'wm th ’ waiter . ” “ Why tha need n't wait o ’ me , ” aw said , “ aw 'll luk after mysel . ” “ Come this way , sur . ” he said , “ aw 'll introduce yo ’ . What name shall aw say , sur ? ” “ Does ta think aw am not known ? ” aw says ; “ nah aw 'll tell thi what it is : if tha keeps diddlin after me like tha has done sin ’ aw come in , as if tha thowt aw wanted to stail summat , awst just twist thi neck raand . ” Th ’ maister heeard me tawkin , an ’ coom to shake hands wi ’ me , smilin ’ all ovver his face delightedly . He hook 'd his arm i ’ mine , an ’ walked me into a grand raam full o ’ ladies an ’ waiters ( aw made ‘ em aat to be waiters coss they wor dressed like him ‘ at stood at th ’ door . ) “ This is my old friend , the Almenack maker , ” he said , an ’ they all gate up an ’ sat daan agean . When aw luk 'd raand aw thowt , “ Aw 'm in for it this time , ” for aw could mak it aat to be nowt but a meetin ’ to kursen a lot o ’ childer ’ , an ’ varry likely they wanted me to stand godfayther for ‘ em . Aw saw noa babbies ony-where , but then aw 'd heeard fowk tell abaat th ’ quality havin ’ weet nurses for ther bairns , an ’ aw made it aat ‘ at thease must be um , on accaant o'th ’ way they wor dressed , for they wor all i ’ white , an ’ ther 's nowt easier weshed , an ’ aw thowt to mysen , “ Aw 'll tell my owd woman to have her gaon made i ’ th ’ same pattern when shoo 's ony more to suckle , for it must save a deal o ’ trouble , an ’ be for ivver better nor havin ’ a lot o ’ hooks an ’ eyes botherin ’ abaat th ’ child 's face . ” But thear aw sat , an ’ as noabody said owt to me , aw said nowt to noabody . In a bit ivery body began pairin ’ off , an ’ th ’ maister says , “ Come , my friend , you must take a lady to dinner , ” an ’ a reight grand young woman coom an ’ tuk howd o ’ mi arm , an ’ we follow 'd aat i ’ prussesshun , like they do at a burrin . When we gate into th ’ next raam aw fan aat mi mistak abaat all th ’ chaps being waiters , for they sat daan to th ’ table same as th ’ maister an ’ me , soa aw thowt varry likely they wor locals , or summat i'th ’ missionary line . Aw niver saw as mich stuff to ait i ’ all my life , except in a cook shop . “ Shall I pass you a little soup , ” said th ’ maister ? “ Noa , thank yo , ” aw said , “ aw weshed me afoor aw coom . ” “ Not soap , my good friend , I mean soup , ” he said . “ Oh ! broth , is it ? Aw did'nt know what yo ment . Eeah , aw 'll tak a soop o ’ broth , if yo please , an ’ a bit o ’ suet dumplin , ’ if yo have a bit . ” When aw said soa , a lot began a cough in ’ , the same as if they 'd a boan i ’ ther throit , an ’ th ’ maister oppened sich a shop ‘ at aw thowt th ’ top ov his heead had come off , but aw reckoned to tak noa noatice an ’ aw worked away wi my gapin ’ stick woll th ’ maister axed me ha aw liked my ox tail soup . “ Dun yo call this ox tail soup , ” aw said , an ’ aw beld up a caah tooith ommust big enuff to mak a knife heft . Aw thowt it war a gooid joak , but noabody else seem 'd to see it , an ’ th ’ mistress ordered th ’ waiter to tak it away instantum .</p>
     <p>When we 'd all etten woll we ’ wor om most brussen they browt a lot o ’ black bottles wi ’ silver necks in , an ’ we 'd all a glass o ’ some sooart o ’ pop . By th ’ heart an ’ it wor pop too . “ Dun yo mak this yoursen , mistress ? ” aw axed . “ By gingo , this licks awr traitle drink into fits , yo mun give me th ’ resait , if yo have it . ” “ This is shampane , sur , ” shoo said . “ Aw dooant care whether it 's sham or not , it 's as gooid as owt o'th ’ sooart aw 've tasted , aw 'll thank you for another drop , ” “ Help yourself , my friend , ” said th ’ maister , an aw did , aboon a bit , but ha long aw wor at it or ha monny bottles aw emptied aw niver knew , for some ha aw fell asleep , an ’ when aw wakken 'd aw wor at hooam , an ’ my owd wornan wor callin aat , “ Are ta baan'ta get up , yond 's th ’ last whew . ”</p>
     <p>Smiles , Tears , Getting on .</p>
     <p>Smiles are things aw like to see , an ’ . they 're noa less acceptable becoss sometimes ther 's a tear or two . A chap at 's a heart ov a reight sooart under his waistcoit cannot allus be smilin ’ . Awve met a deal o ’ sooarts o ’ fowk i ’ my bit o ’ time , an ’ th ’ best aw iver met had a tear i ’ ther ee nah an ’ then . If ther 's owt aw hate to see , its a chap at 's allus smilin ’ ; an ’ if iver yo meet sich a one set him daan to be awther a haufthick or a hypocrite — yo 'll be sure to be reight . It 'll be time enuff to be allus grinnin ’ when all th ’ warkhaases an ’ th ’ prisons are to let — when lawyers have to turn farmers , an ’ bumbaileys have to emigrate — when yo connot find a soldier 's or a policeman 's suit ov clooas , except in a museum — when ther 's noa chllder fun frozen to th ’ deeath o ’ London Brig — an ’ when poor fowk get more beef an ’ less bullyin ’ . If iver sich a time comes woll aw live , aw 'll laff wi ’ th ’ best on em , but till then a claad sometimes will settle on mi here ,— an awm glad ‘ at it is soa .</p>
     <p>Aw niver see a chap ‘ at 's tryin to get on but what he reminds me ov once gooin to a Baptist chapel to see a lot o ’ fowk kursened . Everybody wor feightin ’ for th ’ front pews , an ’ them ‘ at gate ‘ em had to haddle e 'm an ’ net be perticular abaat ther shirt collar — an ’ when a chap starts aat for a front place i ’ this life he has to rough it , an ’ if he succeeds aw wonder sometimes if he 's ony better off nor them ‘ at gate th ’ front seeats i'th ’ chapel , for all ‘ at wor behund ‘ em seem 'd to be tryin ’ to shove ‘ em ovver into th ’ bottom , an ’ nah an ’ then aw noaticed odd uns ‘ at could bide noa longer , an ’ gave up th ’ spot they 'd fowt soa hard to get , an ’ sombdy behund , ‘ at had hardly tewd a bit dropt into th ’ seat . And sich is life : it is n't allus th ’ workers ‘ at succeed , net it marry ! its th ’ skeeamers ! it 's them ‘ at keeps ther een oppen . But aw con allus thoil ‘ em owt they get , if , when they 're climbin ’ up th ’ stee , they niver put ther heel on another chap 's neck , by traidin ’ on his fingers , to mak him lawse his hold . It 's a wrang nooation ‘ at some fowk have getten , to “ get brass honestly if yo can , an ’ if yo cannot , try to keep a easy conscience , an ’ do baat it . ” Some chaps ‘ ll niver get on ; they 're allus gooin ’ to mend , but they niver start . Sich like should tak a pattern throo th ’ Almenack makkers — they 've lost eighteen haars this last three years , an ’ if they did n't mind they 'd loise six mooar this time , but they tak care net to do soa ,— they shove a day extra into February to mak it up , and they call it “ leap year , ” and it ud be a rare gooid job if fowk wod tak a few laups this year ;— laup aat o'th ’ alehouse on to th ’ hearthstun at home — laup aat o ’ bed i ’ time for th ’ church ov a Sunday momin ’ — laup aat o ’ th ’ clutches o ’ th ’ strap shop — laup aat o ’ th ’ gate o ’ bad company — laup up to yo 're wark wi ’ a smile , an ’ laup back hooam wi ’ it , an ’ yo 'll find th ’ wife 's heart ul laup wi joy to see yo comin ’ back cheerful , an ’ th ’ childer ul laup on to yo'r knee , an ’ yo 'll be capt ha easy it 'll be to laup over ony bits o ’ trouble ‘ at yo ’ meet wi ’ . But alus laup forrard if it 's possible ; for if yo try to laup backards yo 'll run th ’ risk o ’ braikin yo'r neck , an ’ noabody pities them ‘ at laups aat o ’ th ’ fryin ’ pan into th ’ fire , an ’ it 's a easy matter to miss it .— Aa dear o ’ me ! aw think it is !— and yo 'd think soa if yo 'd seen what aw saw once . A mate o ’ mine courted a lass , an ’ he 'd monny a miss afore he gat throo wi it . He used to go an ’ tawk to her throo a brokken window ‘ at ther wor i ’ th ’ weshhaase , an ’ one neet shoo 'd promised to meet him thear , an ’ he wanted to kuss her as usual , but he started back . “ Nay , Lucy , ” he said , “ aw 'm sure thar't nooan reight . Has ta been growin ’ a mustash ? ” Mew ! mew ! it went ; an ’ he fan aat he 'd kuss 'd th ’ owd Tom cat . When th ’ neighbours gate to know , they kursened him “ Kusscat , ” an ’ they call him soa yet . But that wor n't all ; for when he went to get wed he wor soa flustered woll he stood i ’ th ’ wrang place , an ’ when th ’ time coom for him to put th ’ ring on , he put it on th ’ woman next to him — he thowt it did n't mean , for he cud get it swap 'd after , but when it wor ovver they all began to find aat ther 'd been a mistak . “ Why , Kusscat , ” said one , “ what 's ta been doin ’ ? Tha ’ s getten wed to thi mother . ” Th ’ parson look 'd glum , but he said , “ It 's noa use botherin ’ nah , its too lat , you should ha ’ spokken afoor — an ’ aw think he 's fittest to be wi ’ his mother . ” But he roar 'd like a bull , an ’ begged th ’ parson to do it ovver , an ’ do it reight ; but Lucy said , “ He 'd noa cashion , for shoo 'd live an ’ dee an owd maid for iver afoor shoo 'd have ony chap second hand . ” But her heart wor n't as hard as shoo thowt , soa , shoo gave in , an ’ th ’ next time they managed better .</p>
     <p>Mysterious Disapperance .</p>
     <p>A short time ago Mr. Fitzivitz , of Rank end , was seen to be swimming at a great rate and making a most extensive spread in the river plate . Several friends cautioned him not to go so far out of his depth , but he was utterly heedless of advice , he dived still deeper , and was observed to sink over head and ears in debt , leaving a large circle of friends to bewail his loss . His body has since been recovered , but all that could have comforted his anxious friends had fled , alas for ever .</p>
     <p>Sam it up .</p>
     <p>Ther 's a deal o ’ things scattered raand , at if fowk ud tak th ’ trouble to pick up might do ‘ em a paar o ’ gooid , an ’ my advice is , if yo meet wi ’ owt i ’ yor way ‘ at 's likely to mak life better or happier , sam it up , but first mak sure yo 've a reight to it . Nah , aw once knew a chap at fan a topcoit , an ’ he came to me , an ’ says — “ A'a lad ! awve fun one o ’ th ’ grandest topcoits to-day at iver tha clapt thi ’ een on . ” “ Why , where did ta find it ? ” aw says . “ Reight o ’ th ’ top o ’ Skurcoit moor . ” “ Well , tha'rt a lucky chap , ” aw says , “ what has ta done wi ’ it ? ” “ Aw niver touched it ; ‘ aw left it just whear it wor . ” “ Well , tha art a faoil ; tha should ha ’ brout it hooam . ” “ E'ea ! an ’ aw should ha ’ done , but does ta see ther wor a chap in it . ” Aw tell 'd him he 'd made a fooil on me , an ’ aw consider 'd mysen dropt on , but noa moor nor he wor wi ’ havin ’ to leave th ’ coit . “ Neer heed , ” he said “ fowk can allus do baat what they can n't get , ” an ’ aw thowt ther wor a bit o ’ wisdom i ’ what he said . But what caps me th ’ mooast is at fowk tug an ’ tew for a thing as if ther life depended on it , an ’ as sooin as they find they cannot get it , they turn raand an ’ say they care nowt abaat it . We 've all heeard tell abaat th ’ “ fox an ’ grapes , ” an ’ ther 's a deal o ’ that sooart o ’ thing . This world 's full o ’ disappointments , an ’ we 've all a share . Th ’ Bradford Exchange wor oppened this month , 1867 , an ’ aw luk on it , that wor a sad disappointment to some . “ Exchange is noa robbery , ” they say , but if some fowk knew what it had cost , they might think it had been a dear swap . Ther are fowk at call it “ a grand success ” — but then awve heeard some call th ’ Halifax Taan Hall “ a grand success , ” but they have n't made me believe it . It may do a deal o ’ gooid , aw 'll not deny that ; it may taich fowk to let things alooan at they dooa n't understand — let 's hooap soa . Ovver th ’ door-hoil they 've put “ Act Wisely , ” an ’ it 's time they did . Its summat like telling a chap to be honest , at the same time yo'r picking his pocket . But we 've noa business to grummel , its awr duty to “ submit to th ’ powers that be ” ( if they 're little ens ) ; but a chap cannot help langin ’ for th ’ time when brains an ’ net brass shall fit a man for a Taan Caancillor . But fowk mun get consolation aat o ’ summat , soa they try to fancy th ’ Taan Hall luks handsome . Its like th ’ chap ‘ at saw his horse fall into th ’ beck ;— he tugg 'd an ’ pool 'd , and shaated an ’ bawl 'd , but th ’ horse went flooatin ’ on , plungin ’ its legs abaat , makkin ’ th ’ watter fly i ’ all direckshuns but it wur noa use , for it wur draanded at th ’ last . When he went hooam he tell 'd th ’ wife abaat it</p>
     <p>“ What does ta say ? ” shoo says ; “ is it draanded ? ”</p>
     <p>“ E'es , it 's draanded , lass ; but it ud ha ’ done thi e'en gooid to ha ’ seen it , aw wor capt ,— mun it wur a topper to swim , an ’ that 's a comfort ; tha knows we could niver ha ’ known that if it had niver been tried . ”</p>
     <p>Lets hooap ‘ at when they 've another to build they 'll do better . Its niver too late to mend , an ’ we 're niver too owd to learn ; but its hard wark to taich some . Aw remember once a chap tellin ’ me hah they made sooap , an ’ he said “ three-thirds o ’ sooap wor tollow , an ’ tother summat else . ” Aw tried to show him ‘ at it could n't be soa , for if three-thirds wor tollow it must be all tollow ; but he said , aw “ need n't start o ’ taichin ’ him ; when he 'd been a sooap boiler twenty year he owt to know . ” Aw saw it wor noa use me talkin ’ , for as Wordsworth says ( or else he does n't )</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ Twor throwing words away , for still ,</l>
       <l n="2">The soap-boiler wod have his will ,</l>
       <l n="3">And said , “ Three-thirds wor tollow . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>But who is ther ‘ at niver does wrang ? net th ’ odd en ! Them ‘ at live i ’ glass haases should n't throw stooans ; soa we 'll drop it . We 're all fooils at times .</p>

       <l n="1">Fooils</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Ther 's some born fooils , an ’ ther 's some mak thersen fooils , an ’ . ther 's some get made fooils on . When we hear fowk tell tales abaat sein ’ boggards , an gettin ’ ther planets ruled , we think it saands fooilish . Nah an ’ then one turns up rayther simple , an ’ a body con hardly help laffin ’ . It 's net long sin ’ aw heeard tell of a owd woman goin ’ to th ’ Pooast Office i ’ Bolton , an ’ axin to see th ’ maister , an , when he coom shoo said shoo wanted to know hah monny stamps it ‘ ud tak ’ to send a mangle to Yeaworth . He could n't tell her , an ’ shoo went away thinkin ’ what a fooil he wor net to know his business better nor that , an ’ he thowt what a fooil shoo wor for ax in sich a question . An ’ soa it is ;— we 're apt to think iverybody fooils but ussen , an ’ them ‘ at belangs to us . Yo doant oft find a mother or fayther ‘ at thinks ther lad 's a fooil ( unless he gets wed , an then they allus say soa . ) Iverybody 's'child is th ’ grandest an ’ th ’ cliverest i'th world . But aw could n't help laffin ’ one day when I heeard a chap braggin ’ abaat his lad . “ Aa , ” he said , “ he 's cliverest lad of his age aw iver met ; he 's nobbut thirteen year owd an ’ he con do owt . ” Just as he wor sayin ’ soa th ’ lad coom into th ’ raam , aitin ’ a raw turnip , an ’ his fayther thowt he 'd show him off a bit , soa he said , “ Jack a want thee to go an ’ messur th ’ length o ’ that piece o ’ timber ‘ at 's i'th yard , an come tell me . ” Soa he gave him his two-fooit rule , an ’ th ’ lad went . Aw thowt he wor a long time abaat it , but in a bit he coom back . “ Well Jack , ” said his fayther , “ ha long is it ? spaik up , that 's a fine lad . ” “ Why , ” he says , “ it 's th ’ length o ’ yo'r rule , an ’ my pocket comb , an ’ this piece o ’ band . ” “ That 's reight , ” said his fayther , “ tha con goa hoam , ” put aw nooaticed ‘ at be did'nt brag abaat him quite so mitch at after .</p>
     <p>If a chap does n't want to be thowt a fooil he should niver start o ’ showin ’ off befoor fowk till he knows what he 's abaat , an ’ ther 's noan on us knows iverything . Aw remember once go in ’ to th ’ sale ov a horse , an ’ th ’ auctioneer knew varry little abaat cattle , an ’ he began praisin ’ it up as he thowt . “ Gentlemen , ” he said , “ will you be kind enough to look at this splendid animal ! examine him , gentlemen ; look at his head ; why , gentlemen , it 's as big as a churn ! an ’ talk about points — why , it 's all points ; you can hang yo'r hat on any part of him ! ” He 'd just getten soa far , when th ’ chap ‘ at belang 'd th ’ horse could bide it noa longer , soa be laup 'd up an ’ pooled th ’ auctioneer daan bith ’ hair o'th ’ heead . “ Tha may be an auctioneer , ” he said , “ but tha'rt noa ostler . ” But it is n't long sin ’ aw wor at a sale o ’ picturs , i'th ’ Teetotal Hall at Halifax , an ’ th ’ chap ‘ at wor sellin ’ put up one lot an ’ made this speech :— “ Ladies and Gentlemen ,— The next lot I have the pleasure to offer you are three picturs of ‘ Joan of Arch ’ a French lady of distinction , who fought at the Battle of Waterloo against the Duke of Wellington , and was afterwards burnt at the siege of Moscow . How much shall I say for this lot ? ” Aw walk 'd aat when awd heeard that , for aw thowt he might happen be a ostler , but blow me if he wor fit for an auctioneer . But we con forgi ’ a chap lukkin fooilish sometimes , if he does n't mak ’ other fowk luk soa ; but when that chap at Saathawarm put bills up to call a meeting o'th ’ committee to consider what color to whitewash th ’ schooil , they all felt fooilish . A young chap ‘ at 's just popp 'd th ’ question to a young woman feels rayther fooilish if shoo says “ Noa . ” An ’ if shoo says “ Yes , ” he may live to think he wor fooilish . A chap feels fooilish when he 's been runnin aboon a mile to catch th ’ train , an ’ just gets thear i ’ time to see it move off an ’ leave him . A chap feels fooilish when he goas to th ’ chapel when ther 's a collection , an ’ finds he 's left th ’ hawpenny at hooam he thowt o ’ givin ’ , an 's nowt noa less nor hauf a craan . A chap feels fooilish if he 's been rakein ’ aat all th ’ neet , an ’ when he gets hooam his wife finds a woman 's neet-cap hung to his coit button . A chap luks fooilish when he 's tellin ’ a tale an ’ forgets hah it finishes . A woman luks fooilish when shoo 's lost her hair pins , an ’ her false bob 's hingin ’ daan her back . An ’ ther are times when we 're all fooilish , an ’ awm feeard if aw doant stop yo may begin to think me fooilish , soa aw 'll drop it .</p>
     <p>Cleenin ’ Daan Month</p>
     <p>May is abaat th ’ warst pairt o'th ’ year for a wed chap , for he connot walk aat , an ’ he cannot be comfortable at hooam , becoss it 's th ’ cleeanin ’ daan time . Talk abaat weshin ’ days ! they 're fooils to cleeanin ’ days . Buckstun lime an ’ whitewesh , bees-wax an ’ turpitine — black-leead an ’ idleback , stare a chap i ’ th ’ face ivery where . Pots an ’ pans — weshin ’ bowls an ’ peggy tubs , winteredges an ’ clooas lines — brooms an ’ besoms — dish claots an ’ map claots , block up ivery nook an ’ corner ; an ’ if iver ther is a time when a chap dar n't spaik it 's then . If he thinks th ’ haase is cleean enuff , an ’ does n't want owt dooin ’ at , his wife 's sure to call him a mucky haand , an ’ say ‘ at he wod n't care if he wor up to th ’ shoo tops i ’ filth ; an ’ if he says he thinks it wants a cleean , shoo 'll varry sooin ax him if he can tell her whear ther 's another haase as cleean , for shoo does n't know one , an ’ if he does , he 's welcome to goa . But it all ends i ’ th ’ same thing — its th ’ time o ’ th ’ year for a reight upset , an ’ it ‘ ll ha to have it , whether it wants it or net . Ther 's noa way to suit a woman at sich times , but to be as quiet as yo can . If yo say , “ Come , lass , con aw help thi a bit , ” shoo 's sure to snap at yo , as if shoo 'd bite yor heead off , an ’ tell yo to get aat ov her gate , for yor allus under her nooas , woll shoo can do nowt . An ’ if yo goa aat o'th ’ gate , shoo 'll ax yo as sooin as yo come in , ha yo can fashion to spend ’ yor time gaddin abaat when yo know ha things is at hooam , an ’ you dooant care th ’ toss ov a button for her , but just mak her into a slave , an ’ niver think o ’ sich a thing as liggin ’ on a helpin ’ hand . Ther 's noa way to do but to bide it as weel as yo can , an ’ say little , for it does n't last long . But even when its ovver , yo mun be careful what yo say , for if yo tell her yo think it luks better for th ’ labor , shoo 's sure to say at “ shoo sees varry little difference , an ’ shoo wor fare capt , for ivery thing wor as cleean as a pin . ” An ’ if yo say yo can see noa difference , shoo 'll say , “ Tha can see nowtt , ” — but shoo knows whether its different or net , for shoo 's taen aboon a barra ’ looad o ’ muck aat o ’ that haase that wick . Soa my advice is , to say nowt at sich times till yo 're axed , an then say as they say . Aw once heeard ov a young couple at wor baan to get wed , an ’ they made it up allus to say an ’ think alike , an ’ then they 'd be sure net to fall aat ; soa they went to th ’ church an ’ gate made man an wife , an ’ as they wor walkin ’ hooam he said , “ Aw think this is th ’ happiest day o ’ awr lives . ” “ E'ea , ” shoo says , “ aw think it is . ” “ Aw think we shall have some rain afoor long , ” he said . “ E'ea , ” shoo says , “ aw think it luks likely for weet . ” “ A'a did ta iver see a faaler bonnet nor that lass has on , ” shoo said ? “ Noa lass , aw think aw niver did , ” he replied ; “ but what a bonny lass shoo is , is n't shoo ? ” “ Nay , nobbut middlin ’ , ” shoo says . “ Well aw think her a beauty . ” “ Aw wonder where tha luks , ” shoo said , “ but if tha'rt soa taen wi ’ her , tha con have her astead o ’ me . ” “ Nay , lass , ” he said , “ tha knows we 've agreed allus to think an ’ say alike , an ’ awm sure shoo 's a varry bonny lass . ” “ Well an ’ awm sure shoo 's as plain a stick as iver aw saw i ’ all my life , an ’ if aw agree to say an ’ think what tha does , it wor cos aw thowt tha wor reight i ’ thi heead . ” Soa they walk 'd hooam lukkin varry glum , an ’ differ 'd for th ’ futer same as other fowk . When a chap gets wed he should be ready for th ’ warst . Aw once knew a chap at fell i ’ love wi a woman ‘ at he met in a railway train , an ’ as they lived a long way apart , they did ther coortin i ’ writin ’ an ’ at last th ’ day wor fixed for ‘ em to get wed. Joa went to fotch her an ’ walk her to th ’ church , an ’ as they wor gooin ’ he thowt shoo walked rayther queer , soa he says , “ Susy , does ta limp ? ” “ Limp ! ” shoo says , “ net aw , aw limp noan . ” Soa they went on , an ’ just as they wor gooin ’ into th ’ church , he said , “ Susy , awm sure tha seems to limp . ” “ A'a , Joa , ” shoo says , “ aw wonder what tha 'll say next . ” Soa Joa an ’ Susy gate wed . When they wor gooin hooam he said , “ Susy , awm sure tha limps . ” “ Aw know aw limp , ” shoo says , “ aw allus limp 'd ; is a woman ony war for limpin ’ ? ”</p>

       <l n="1">Hay-Making</l>
     </lg>
     <p>I hope my readers will regard that varry gooid advice , when they see th ’ grass cut — “ Mak hay woll th ‘ sun shines . ” There 's nowt aw like better nor to spend a day or two in a hay field . Tawk abaat “ Ho de Colong ! ” It does n't smell hauf as weel to me as a wisp o ’ new made hay . An ’ them ‘ at niver knew th ’ luxury a ’ gooin ’ to bed wi ’ tired booans , should work i'th ’ hay-field for a wick . It 'll do onnybody gooid ; an ’ if some o ’ them idle laewts ‘ at stand bi a duzzen together at th ’ loin ends laikin at pitch an ’ toss , wod goa an ’ work at pitch an ’ toss , they 'd be better booath i ’ mind an ’ body an ’ pocket . Tossin ’ th ’ hay is booath healthful an ’ lawfur but tossin ’ hawpneys ( especially them wi ’ heeads o ’ booath sides ) is nawther . Hay makkin ’ is a honest callin ’ , an ’ when a chap is gettin ’ his livin ’ honestly ( noa matter what he does ) , he feels independent ,— an ’ when a chap feels soa , he can affooard to spaik what he thinks . Aw remember once callin ’ at th ’ “ Calder an ’ Hebble ” public haase , an ’ sittin ’ in a raam wi ’ a lot o ’ young swells ‘ at coom throo Sowerby Brigg ; an ’ in a bit , a trampified lukkin ’ chap coom in , an ’ called for a glass o ’ ale . This did n't suit th ’ young gentlemen , soa one on ‘ em says to him , “ Fellow , you are an intruder . ” “ Tha'rt a liar , ” th ’ chap says , “ awm nowt at sooart , awm a cheer-bottom mender an ’ aw 've sarved mi time to it . ” “ You do n't understand me , sir ; what I mean is that you have no business here . ” “ Noa , lad ; aw niver come to theeas shops when aw 've ony business , aw allus do that furst . ” This rayther puzzled th ’ young swell an ’ his face went as red as a hep , cos aw laff 'd at him ; an ’ he struck his naive o'th ’ table ; “ Sir , ” said he , “ will you take your departure ? ” “ Noa , ” he said , “ aw 'll tak nowt ‘ at does n't belang to me if aw know on it . ” “ You 're an insolent scoundrel , and I leave you with contempt . ” “ Yo can leeav me wi ’ who yo like , ” he said , “ awst mislest noabody if they behave therlsen ” . They all went an ’ left him , an ’ as sooin as they 'd getten aat o'th ’ seet he set up a gurt laff , an ’ called for another glass ; an ’ aw nooatised at he gave th ’ landlord a Sovereign to tak pay aat on , an ’ when he brout him his change back , he said , “ Thank you , sir , ” an ’ bow 'd to him as if he 'd been one o'th ’ gentry . This happened o'th ’ same day as aw 'd been at Briggus , an ’ awst net forget that in a hurry :— aw 'll tell yo abaat it . It wor a varry hot day , an ’ aw 'd walked throo Halifax , an ’ wor beginin ’ to get rayther dry , an ’ when aw 'd getten ommost thear , aw saw a booard shoved aat ov a chamer winder , wi ’ th ’ words painted on , “ Prime Ginger Beer Sold here , ” soa aw went into th ’ haase an ’ ax 'd for a bottle . He browt me a old hair oil bottle filled wi ’ summat , an a varry mucky-lukkin glass to sup aat on . “ Cannot yo let me have a cleean glass , maister ? ” aw axed . “ That 's clean , ” he says , “ for aw bowt it aboon twelve months sin , an'it ' s niver been used for owt but pop . ” Aw emptied th ’ bottle into it , an it lukk 'd ommost like milk sops . “ What do yo call all thease things at 's swimmin ’ abaat ? ” aw says . “ O , that 's yeast , young man ; it 's a varry gooid thing for ther inside ; aw 'd a doctor once call 'd for a bottle , an ’ he wod n't let me tak a bit aat : it does fowk gooid . ” “ Well but wod n't he let yo tak some o ’ theas pieces o ’ cork aat ? ” aw axed . “ Net a bit ! for he said they acted tother rooad , an ’ it wor th ’ best to sup th ’ lot . ” “ Do yo sell a gooid deal o ’ this , maister ? ” “ A'a bless yo ! aw do that . Ther wor a real lady coom here o ’ Sunday afternooin , an ’ shoo supp 'd seven bottles , an ’ shoo said shoo 'd ha supped seventeen but her stumack wor varry kittle , an ’ shoo wor feear 'd e ’ upsettin it . ” “ An ’ wor ther as mich yeast in ‘ em as ther is i ’ this ? ” aw said . “ E'ea ! an ’ moor i ’ some . ” “ Why , then , ” aw said , “ aw should think shoo 'd rise early i'th mornin ’ . ” “ Ther 's nowt noa better for gooin ’ to bed on , nor for gettin ’ up on , nor that pop . ” Just then somdy coom in for a hawporth o ’ mustard , an ’ woll he turn 'd raand aw emptied it daan th ’ sink , paid mi penny , an ’ hook 'd it . Soa mich for Briggus , aw thowt . Aw 've oft heeard it spokken on as a risin ’ place , an noa wonder if they swallow yeast at that rate . But aw dooant see what all this has to do wi ’ haymakkin ’ , soa aw 'll rake up noa moar sich like things , for fear yo pitch into me .</p>
     <p>Holinworth Lake</p>
     <p>Th ’ mooast remarkable thing ‘ at aw ’ con recollect abaat this time last year , wor a trip to Hollinworth Lake . Ther 'd been a collection made at the Longloin Sunday Schooil for a new gas meeter ; an after they 'd getten th ’ brass , they bethought ‘ em ‘ at th ’ old en could be made do , an ’ soa th ’ taichers agreed to have a trip wi ’ th ’ funds . They argued a gooid deeal abaat ha to spend it , an ’ at last it wor decided they should walk all th ’ rooad , an ’ spend it as they went on . They started aat at four o'clock one Setterday mornin ’ i ’ furst rate fettle . Ther wor six men an ’ seven women ; but as th ’ superintendent wor as big as two , they considered thersen weel paired . They trudged nicely on till they gate to Bolton Brow , an ’ then two or three began to feel faint , an ’ Swallow ( that 's th ’ superintendent 's name ) propooased ‘ at they should have a drop o ’ drink to revive ‘ em . Noabdy had owt to say agean that , soa as th ’ public haase wor just oppened , one on ‘ em went in an ’ browt aat a quart pitcher full an ’ handed it to Swallow to sup th ’ furst . An ’ he did sup — for when he left lause ther wor nowt left but th ’ froth on his upper lip to tell at ther 'd iver bin ony . “ Well ” said Lijah , “ aw 've heeared swallows called burds of passage , but if they 'd all a passage like thee , they 'd sup th ’ sea dry . ” “ Tha sees , Lijah , ” he said , “ awm unfortunate , for aw 've a thirst on me ‘ at aw cannot quench , an ’ aw dar n't sup watter for fear o ’ havin ’ th ’ dropsy . ” All th ’ women agreed ’ at he wor reight , an ’ soa after another quart amang em they went on .</p>
     <p>What wi ’ laffin , an ’ talkin , ’ an ’ smookin , they gate to Blackstone Edge Moor , an ’ some of the women thowt it time for a rest , soa Swallow stop 'd all at once an ’ said , “ Do yo all see that stooan post ‘ at 's standin ’ thear ? That 's the stooan at devides Yorksher an ’ Lankysher , an ’ aw think this a ‘ varry fit time to say a few words woll yo ease yor legs a bit . ” Soa up he climb 'd onto th ’ pooast , an ’ began praichin away , an ’ kept at it woll they wor all hauf pined to deeath . At last Lijah said , “ Hang it up , ha long are ta baan to talk ? aw wonder thi conscience does n't prick thee ! ” “ Prick me ! ” he said , “ Aw defy owt to prick me when awm laborin ’ for a gooid cause . ” Just then he ovver balanced hissel an ’ fell slap into th ’ middle ov a whin bush ; but he wor up in a crack , an ’ one o ’ th ’ lasses said , “ if his conscience had n't getten prick 'd summat else had , ” an ’ they went forrard , but Swallow kept his hand under his coit lap for a mile or two . They gate to th ’ lake at last , an ’ after enjayin ’ what they call th ’ seea breeze , they started off to see some o ’ th ’ places ov interest . One o ’ th ’ furst they steer 'd to wor th ’ birthplace o ’ Tim Bobbin . “ An ’ who wor Tim Bobbin ? ” said one o ’ th ’ lasses . This puzzled ‘ em , for ther wor n't one i'th ’ lot ‘ at knew ; but one o ’ th ’ chaps said he thowt , if he wor n't mistakken , he war th ’ inventor o ’ th ’ spinnin ’ mule . Th ’ superintendent said that wor varry likely , for he 'd oft nooatised when readin ’ history books , ‘ at chaps gate ther names throo summat they 'd done , an ’ soa varry likely he gate called Tim Bobbin for that reason . After that they went back an ’ had a ride in a booat , an ’ as nooan on em knew ha to row , th ’ watter were varry sooin ankle deep inside ; some on ‘ em began to grummel at this . “ Oh , niver heed , ” said Swallow , “ yo 'll niver catch cold wi ’ salt watter . ” It wor n't long afoor they wanted ther tea , soa they went into th ’ haase an ’ ordered a gooid feed . Aw 've heeard cunjurors say , “ Quick , Jack , fly , ” when they 've been puttin ’ summat aat o'th ’ seet ; but ther wor n't time to say that wi ’ them , for th ’ breead and butter went like leetnin ’ . One plate full after another kept comin ’ in , till at last th ’ mistress said , “ Aw think yo must ha ’ been hungry ? ” “ E'ea , it 's change o ’ climate ‘ at does it , ” they said . Soa shoo browt in a fresh lot , but it made noa difference ; away it went after tother . “ Do yo ’ know , ” . shoo says , when shoo coom in agean , “ at yo 've etten two pund o ’ breead apiece ? ” “ Why what 's two pund when its cut thin , ” they said ? An ’ at it they went agean . When they could n't find room for ony moor , they paid ther shot an ’ started off hooam , whear they landed safely . Th ’ next Sunday neet , when th ’ gas wor lit at schooil iverybody wor capt to see what an ’ improvement th ’ new meter wor . Soa after passin ’ a vote o ’ thanks to th ’ superintendent an ’ th ’ taichers for th ’ trouble they ’ been put to , th ’ matter dropt .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>A lecture on this subject was delivered on Tuesday evening , to the members of the Ladies ’ Needle and Thimble Association , by the Rev . James Sleek , curate of St. Enock'shYpppHeNinhYpppHeNthehYpppHeNMist . After adverting to the plagues of Egypt , the learned lecturer dwelt at length upon the plagues of the present day , which he classed under the following heads : — Servants , poor relations , borrowers , teetotallars , tobacco-smokers , and children in arms . To counteract these evils were such associations as the one he had the honor to address , select tea meetings , fancy bazaars , and perambulators . The lecture gave great satisfaction .</p>
     <p>End o ’ th ’ Year</p>
     <p>It 's a long loin ‘ at 's niver a turn , an ’ th ’ longest loin ends somewhear . Ther 's a end to mooast things , an ’ this is th ’ end o ’ the year . When a chap gets turned o ’ forty , years dooant seem as long as once they did — he begins to be feeared o ’ time rolling on — but it 's fooilish , for it nawther gooas faster nor slower nor iver it did . But he 's a happy chap ‘ at , when th ’ year ends , can luk back an ’ think ha mich gooid he 's done , for it is n't what a chap will do for th ’ futer , its what he has done i'th ’ past ‘ at fowk mun judge by . Its net wise for onybody to booast o ’ what they mean to do in a month 's time , becoss we cannot tell what a month 's time may do for us . We can hardly help havin ’ a gloomy thowt or two at this part o'th ’ year , but Kursmiss comes to cheer us up a bit , an ’ he 's nooan ov a gooid sooart ‘ at can n't be jolly once i'th ’ year . As an owd friend o ’ mine has cliverly said :—</p>

       <l n="1">Come let us choose the better part ,</l>
       <l n="2">And sing whilst life is given ;</l>

       <l n="5">‘ Tis Christmas time , then fill the horn ,</l>
       <l n="6">Away with melancholy ,</l>
       <l n="7">If there 's no leaves upon the thorn ,</l>
       <l n="8">There is upon the holly .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Hi ! varry true ! When ther 's no leaves upon th ’ thorn , they 're green upon the holly . Ther 's allus summat to be thankful for if we seek it aat — ther 's sure to be a bit o ’ sunshine somewhere — an ’ its a varry bad case if a chap can n't find consolation aat o ’ summat .</p>
     <p>Aw remember a case ov a woman deein ’ ‘ at aw knew , an ’ aw met th ’ husband lukkin ’ varry glum a bit at after . “ Well Joa , ” aw said , “ tha 's had a heavy loss , lad . ” “ Eea , aw have , ” an ’ then after studdyin ’ a bit , he said , “ but aw should ha had to ha bowt a new suit afoor long , an ’ aw mud as weel buy black as any other color ; it wod ha been awkerd if aw 'd just getten a white hat , as aw thowt on — but Providence ! orders all things for th ’ best . ”</p>
     <p>Ther 's noa daat a gooid lot on us find consolation aat o'th ’ Kursmiss jollification — its just a bit ov a sweetener afoor all th ’ nooats begin o ’ commin ’ in ; aw dooant mean five paand nooats , ther 's nooan monny o ’ them stirrin ’ . It 's th ’ coil nooats , an ’ gas nooats , an ’ tax papers , them 's th ’ sooart at 's stirrin abaat this time . Wheniver ther 's a knock at th ’ door , yo may ventur to put yor hand i ’ yor pocket ; an ’ happy he must feel ‘ at can allus find as mich thear as 'll do . But its time enuff to think abaat that sooart o ’ thing when it comes ; we 've plenty to do nah to think abaat plum pudding an ’ rooast beef — an ’ aw hooap at iverybody ‘ at reads this may have enuff an ’ to spare . If aw could do owt to help yo to enjoy yorsen , awm sure aw wod , but as that 's aat o ’ mi paar , just afoor aw leave for another twelve months aw 'll gie yo a tooast , an ’ aw hooap yo 'll all drink a bumper to it . Here gooas ! Fill up to th ’ brim ! Are yo ready ? Here 's off !</p>

     </lg>
     <p>“ On Valentine 's day , will a gooid gooise lay , ” is a varry old sayin ’ , an ’ aw dare say a varry gooid en ; an ’ if all th ’ geese wod nobbut lay o ’ that day ther 'd be moor chonce o ’ eggs bein ’ cheap . But it is n't th ’ geese we think on at th ’ fourteenth o ’ this month i'ts th ’ little ducks , an ’ th ’ billy dux . A'a aw wish aw 'd all th ’ brass ‘ at 's spent o ’ valentines for one year ; aw wod n't thank th ’ queen to be mi aunt . Ther 's nobdy sends me valentines nah . Aw 've known th ’ time when they did , but aw 'm like a old stage cooach , aw 'm aat o ’ date . Aw'st niver forget th ’ furst valentine aw had sent . Th ’ pooastman browt it afoor aw 'd getten aat o ’ bed , an ’ it happen 'd to be Sunday mornin ’ . Aw read it ovver an ’ ovver agean , an ’ aw luk 'd at th ’ directions an ’ th ’ pooast mark , but aw cud n't make aat for mi life who 'd sent it ; but whoiver it war aw wor detarmined to fall i ’ love wi ’ her as soain as aw gate to know . Then aw shov 'd it under th ’ piller an ’ shut mi een an ’ tried to fancy what sooart ov a lass shoo must be , an ’ someha aw fell asleep , an ’ aw dremt , but aw will n't tell yo what aw dremt for fear yo 'll laff . But when aw wakken 'd , aw sowt up an ’ daan , but nowhere could aw find th ’ valentine . Aw wor ommost heartbrokken , an ’ aw pool 'd all th ’ cloas off th ’ bed , an ’ aw luk 'd under it , an ’ ovver it , but net a bit on it could aw see , an ’ at last aw began to fancy ‘ at aw must ha dremt all th ’ lot , an ’ ‘ at aw 'd niver had one sent at all ; but when aw wor gettin ’ mi breeches on , blow me ! if it worn ’ t stuck fast wi a wafer to mi shirt lap . What her ‘ at sent it ud a sed if shoo 'd seen it , aw can n't tell an ’ aw wod n't if aw could ; but aw know one thing , aw wor niver i ’ sich a muck sweeat afoor sin aw wor born , an ’ when aw went to mi braikfast aw ‘ wor soa maddled , wol aw could n't tell which wor th ’ reight end o'th ’ porridge spooin , but aw comforted misen at last wi ’ thinkin ’ ‘ at aw wor n't th ’ furst ‘ at had turned ther back ov a valentine .</p>
