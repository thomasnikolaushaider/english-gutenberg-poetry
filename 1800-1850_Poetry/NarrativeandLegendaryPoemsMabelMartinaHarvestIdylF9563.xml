    <docTitle><titlePart>MABEL MARTIN . A HARVEST IDYL . Susanna Martin , an aged woman of Amesbury , Mass ., was tried and executed for the alleged crime of witchcraft . Her home was in what is now known as Pleasant Valley on the Merrimac , a little above the old Ferry way , where , tradition says , an attempt was made to assassinate Sir Edmund Andros on his way to Falmouth ( afterward Portland ) and Pemaquid , which was frustrated by a warning timely given . Goody Martin was the only woman hanged on the north side of the Merrimac during the dreadful delusion . The aged wife of Judge Bradbury who lived on the other side of the Powow River was imprisoned and would have been put to death but for the collapse of the hideous persecution .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>The substance of the poem which follows was published under the name of The Witch 's Daughter , in The National Era in<date>1857</date>. In<date>1875</date>my publishers desired to issue it with illustrations , and I then enlarged it and otherwise altered it to its present form . The principal addition was in the verses which constitute Part I .</docImprint>

   <p>PROEM . I CALL the old time back : I bring my lay in tender memory of the summer day When , where our native river lapsed away ,</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">We dreamed it over , while the thrushes made</l>
     <l n="2">Songs of their own , and the great pine-trees laid</l>
     <l n="3">On warm noonlights the masses of their shade .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">And she was with us , living o'er again</l>
     <l n="5">Her life in ours , despite of years and pain ,—</l>
     <l n="6">The Autumn 's brightness after latter rain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">Beautiful in her holy peace as one</l>
     <l n="8">Who stands , at evening , when the work is done ,</l>
     <l n="9">Glorified in the setting of the sun !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">Her memory makes our common landscape seem</l>
     <l n="11">Fairer than any of which painters dream ;</l>
     <l n="12">Lights the brown hills and sings in every stream ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="13">For she whose speech was always truth 's pure gold</l>
     <l n="14">Heard , not unpleased , its simple legends told ,</l>
     <l n="15">And loved with us the beautiful and old .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>I . THE RIVER VALLEY . Across the level tableland , A grassy , rarely trodden way , With thinnest skirt of birchen spray</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">And stunted growth of cedar , leads</l>
     <l n="2">To where you see the dull plain fall</l>
     <l n="3">Sheer off , steep-slanted , ploughed by all</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">The seasons ’ rainfalls . On its brink</l>
     <l n="5">The over-leaning harebells swing ,</l>
     <l n="6">With roots half bare the pine-trees cling ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">And , through the shadow looking west ,</l>
     <l n="8">You see the wavering river flow</l>
     <l n="9">Along a vale , that far below</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">Holds to the sun , the sheltering hills</l>
     <l n="11">And glimmering water-line between ,</l>
     <l n="12">Broad fields of corn and meadows green ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="13">And fruit-bent orchards grouped around</l>
     <l n="14">The low brown roofs and painted eaves ,</l>
     <l n="15">And chimney-tops half hid in leaves .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="16">No warmer valley hides behind</l>
     <l n="17">Yon wind-scourged sand-dunes , cold and bleak ;</l>
     <l n="18">No fairer river comes to seek</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="19">The wave-sung welcome of the sea ,</l>
     <l n="20">Or mark the northmost border line</l>
     <l n="21">Of sun-loved growths of nut and vine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="22">Here , ground-fast in their native fields ,</l>
     <l n="23">Untempted by the city 's gain ,</l>
     <l n="24">The quiet farmer folk remain</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="25">Who bear the pleasant name of Friends ,</l>
     <l n="26">And keep their fathers ’ gentle ways</l>
     <l n="27">And simple speech of Bible days ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="28">In whose neat homesteads woman holds</l>
     <l n="29">With modest ease her equal place ,</l>
     <l n="30">And wears upon her tranquil face</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="31">The look of one who , merging not</l>
     <l n="32">Her self-hood in another 's will ,</l>
     <l n="33">Is love 's and duty 's handmaid still .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="34">Pass with me down the path that winds</l>
     <l n="35">Through birches to the open land ,</l>
     <l n="36">Where , close upon the river strand</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="37">You mark a cellar , vine o'errun ,</l>
     <l n="38">Above whose wall of loosened stones</l>
     <l n="39">The sumach lifts its reddening cones ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="40">And the black nightshade 's berries shine ,</l>
     <l n="41">And broad , unsightly burdocks fold</l>
     <l n="42">The household ruin , century-old .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="43">Here , in the dim colonial time</l>
     <l n="44">Of sterner lives and gloomier faith ,</l>
     <l n="45">A woman lived , tradition saith ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="46">Who wrought her neighbors foul annoy ,</l>
     <l n="47">And witched and plagued the country-side ,</l>
     <l n="48">Till at the hangman 's hand she died .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="49">Sit with me while the westering day</l>
     <l n="50">Falls slantwise down the quiet vale ,</l>
     <l n="51">And , haply ere yon loitering sail ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="52">That rounds the upper headland , falls</l>
     <l n="53">Below Deer Island 's pines , or sees</l>
     <l n="54">Behind it Hawkswood 's belt of trees</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="55">Rise black against the sinking sun ,</l>
     <l n="56">My idyl of its days of old ,</l>
     <l n="57">The valley 's legend , shall be told .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>II . THE HUSKING . It was the pleasant harvest-time , When cellar-bins are closely stowed , And garrets bend beneath their load ,</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">And the old swallow-haunted barns ,—</l>
     <l n="2">Brown-gabled , long , and full of seams</l>
     <l n="3">Through which the rooted sunlight streams ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">And winds blow freshly in , to shake</l>
     <l n="5">The red plumes of the roosted cocks ,</l>
     <l n="6">And the loose hay-mow 's scented locks ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">Are filled with summer 's ripened stores ,</l>
     <l n="8">Its odorous grass and barley sheaves ,</l>
     <l n="9">From their low scaffolds to their eaves .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">On Esek Harden 's oaken floor ,</l>
     <l n="11">With many an autumn threshing worn ,</l>
     <l n="12">Lay the heaped ears of unhusked corn .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="13">And thither came young men and maids ,</l>
     <l n="14">Beneath a moon that , large and low ,</l>
     <l n="15">Lit that sweet eve of long ago .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="16">They took their places ; some by chance ,</l>
     <l n="17">And others by a merry voice</l>
     <l n="18">Or sweet smile guided to their choice .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="19">How pleasantly the rising moon ,</l>
     <l n="20">Between the shadow of the mows ,</l>
     <l n="21">Looked on them through the great elm-boughs !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="22">On sturdy boyhood , sun-embrowned ,</l>
     <l n="23">On girlhood with its solid curves</l>
     <l n="24">Of healthful strength and painless nerves !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="25">And jests went round , and laughs that made</l>
     <l n="26">The house-dog answer with his howl ,</l>
     <l n="27">And kept astir the barn-yard fowl ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="28">And quaint old songs their fathers sung</l>
     <l n="29">In Derby dales and Yorkshire moors ,</l>
     <l n="30">Ere Norman William trod their shores ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="31">And tales , whose merry license shook</l>
     <l n="32">The fat sides of the Saxon thane ,</l>
     <l n="33">Forgetful of the hovering Dane ,—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="34">Rude plays to Celt and Cimbri known ,</l>
     <l n="35">The charms and riddles that beguiled</l>
     <l n="36">On Oxus ’ banks the young world 's child ,—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="37">That primal picture-speech wherein</l>
     <l n="38">Have youth and maid the story told ,</l>
     <l n="39">So new in each , so dateless old ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="40">Recalling pastoral Ruth in her</l>
     <l n="41">Who waited , blushing and demure ,</l>
     <l n="42">The red-ear 's kiss of forfeiture .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="43">But still the sweetest voice was mute</l>
     <l n="44">That river-valley ever heard</l>
     <l n="45">From lips of maid or throat of bird ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="46">For Mabel Martin sat apart ,</l>
     <l n="47">And let the hay-mow 's shadow fall</l>
     <l n="48">Upon the loveliest face of all .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="49">She sat apart , as one forbid ,</l>
     <l n="50">Who knew that none would condescend</l>
     <l n="51">To own the Witch-wife 's child a friend .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="52">The seasons scarce had gone their round ,</l>
     <l n="53">Since curious thousands thronged to see</l>
     <l n="54">Her mother at the gallows-tree ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="55">And mocked the prison-palsied limbs</l>
     <l n="56">That faltered on the fatal stairs ,</l>
     <l n="57">And wan lip trembling with its prayers !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="58">Few questioned of the sorrowing child ,</l>
     <l n="59">Or , when they saw the mother die ;</l>
     <l n="60">Dreamed of the daughter 's agony .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="61">They went up to their homes that day ,</l>
     <l n="62">As men and Christians justified</l>
     <l n="63">God willed it , and the wretch had died !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="64">Dear God and Father of us all ,</l>
     <l n="65">Forgive our faith in cruel lies ,—</l>

     <l n="67">Forgive thy creature when he takes ,</l>
     <l n="68">For the all-perfect love Thou art ,</l>
     <l n="69">Some grim creation of his heart .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="70">Cast down our idols , overturn</l>
     <l n="71">Our bloody altars ; let us see</l>
     <l n="72">Thyself in Thy humanity !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="73">Young Mabel from her mother 's grave</l>
     <l n="74">Crept to her desolate hearth-stone ,</l>
     <l n="75">And wrestled with her fate alone ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="76">With love , and anger , and despair ,</l>
     <l n="77">The phantoms of disordered sense ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="79">Oh , dreary broke the winter days ,</l>
     <l n="80">And dreary fell the winter nights</l>
     <l n="81">When , one by one , the neighboring lights</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="82">Went out , and human sounds grew still ,</l>
     <l n="83">And all the phantom-peopled dark</l>
     <l n="84">Closed round her hearth-fire 's dying spark .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="85">And summer days were sad and long ,</l>
     <l n="86">And sad the uncompanioned eves ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="88">And Indian Summer 's airs of balm ;</l>
     <l n="89">She scarcely felt the soft caress ,</l>
     <l n="90">The beauty died of loneliness !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="91">The school-boys jeered her as they passed ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="94">And still o'er many a neighboring door</l>
     <l n="95">She saw the horseshoe 's curved charm ,</l>
     <l n="96">To guard against her mother 's harm !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="33">
     <l n="97">That mother , poor and sick and lame ,</l>

     <l n="100">Who turned , in Salem 's dreary jail ,</l>

   <p>IV . THE CHAMPION . So in the shadow Mabel sits ; Untouched by mirth she sees and hears , Her smile is sadder than her tears .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">But cruel eyes have found her out ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">She answered not with railing words ,</l>
     <l n="5">But drew her apron o'er her face ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">And only pausing at the door ,</l>
     <l n="8">Her sad eyes met the troubled gaze</l>
     <l n="9">Of one who , in her better days ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">Had been her warm and steady friend ,</l>
     <l n="11">Ere yet her mother 's doom had made</l>
     <l n="12">Even Esek Harden half afraid .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="13">He felt that mute appeal of tears ,</l>
     <l n="14">And , starting , with an angry frown ,</l>
     <l n="15">Hushed all the wicked murmurs down .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">

   <p>THE TRUCE OF PISCATAQUA .</p>
   <p>In the winter of 1675-76 , the Eastern Indians , who had been making war upon the New Hampshire settlements , were so reduced in numbers by fighting and famine that they agreed to a peace with Major Waldron at Dover , but the peace was broken in the fall of 1676 . The famous chief , Squando , was the principal negotiator on the part of the savages . He had taken up the hatchet to revenge the brutal treatment of his child by drunken white sailors , which caused its death .</p>
   <p>It not unfrequently happened during the Border wars that young white children were adopted by their Indian captors , and so kindly treated that they were unwilling to leave the free , wild life of the woods ; and in some instances they utterly refused to go back with their parents to their old homes and civilization .</p>

     <l n="1">As they who watch by sick-beds find relief</l>
     <l n="2">Unwittingly from the great stress of grief</l>
     <l n="3">And anxious care , in fantasies outwrought</l>
     <l n="4">From the hearth 's embers flickering low , or caught</l>
     <l n="5">From whispering wind , or tread of passing feet ,</l>
     <l n="6">Or vagrant memory calling up some sweet</l>
     <l n="7">Snatch of old song or romance , whence or why</l>
     <l n="8">They scarcely know or ask ,— so , thou and I ,</l>
     <l n="9">Nursed in the faith that Truth alone is strong</l>
     <l n="10">In the endurance which outwearies Wrong ,</l>
     <l n="11">With meek persistence baffling brutal force ,</l>
     <l n="12">And trusting God against the universe ,—</l>
     <l n="13">We , doomed to watch a strife we may not share</l>
     <l n="14">With other weapons than the patriot 's prayer ,</l>
     <l n="15">Yet owning , with full hearts and moistened eyes ,</l>
     <l n="16">The awful beauty of self-sacrifice ,</l>
     <l n="17">And wrung by keenest sympathy for all</l>
     <l n="18">Who give their loved ones for the living wall</l>
     <l n="19">‘ Twixt law and treason ,— in this evil day</l>
     <l n="20">May haply find , through automatic play</l>
     <l n="21">Of pen and pencil , solace to our pain ,</l>
     <l n="22">And hearten others with the strength we gain .</l>
     <l n="23">I know it has been said our times require</l>
     <l n="24">No play of art , nor dalliance with the lyre ,</l>
     <l n="25">No weak essay with Fancy 's chloroform</l>
     <l n="26">To calm the hot , mad pulses of the storm ,</l>
     <l n="27">But the stern war-blast rather , such as sets</l>
     <l n="28">The battle 's teeth of serried bayonets ,</l>
     <l n="29">And pictures grim as Vernet 's . Yet with these</l>
     <l n="30">Some softer tints may blend , and milder keys</l>
     <l n="31">Relieve the storm-stunned ear . Let us keep sweet ,</l>
     <l n="32">If so we may , our hearts , even while we eat</l>
     <l n="33">The bitter harvest of our own device</l>
     <l n="34">And half a century 's moral cowardice .</l>
     <l n="35">As Nurnberg sang while Wittenberg defied ,</l>

     <l n="37">And through the war-march of the Puritan</l>
     <l n="38">The silver stream of Marvell 's music ran ,</l>
     <l n="39">So let the household melodies be sung ,</l>
     <l n="40">The pleasant pictures on the wall be hung —</l>
     <l n="41">So let us hold against the hosts of night</l>
     <l n="42">And slavery all our vantage-ground of light .</l>
     <l n="43">Let Treason boast its savagery , and shake</l>
     <l n="44">From its flag-folds its symbol rattlesnake ,</l>
     <l n="45">Nurse its fine arts , lay human skins in tan ,</l>
     <l n="46">And carve its pipe-bowls from the bones of man ,</l>
     <l n="47">And make the tale of Fijian banquets dull</l>
     <l n="48">By drinking whiskey from a loyal skull ,—</l>
     <l n="49">But let us guard , till this sad war shall cease ,</l>

     <l n="57">Rhythmic , and sweet , beguiles my pen away</l>
     <l n="58">From the sharp strifes and sorrows of to-day .</l>
     <l n="59">Thus , while the east-wind keen from Labrador</l>
     <l n="60">Sings it the leafless elms , and from the shore</l>
     <l n="61">Of the great sea comes the monotonous roar</l>
     <l n="62">Of the long-breaking surf , and all the sky</l>
     <l n="63">Is gray with cloud , home-bound and dull , I try</l>
     <l n="64">To time a simple legend to the sounds</l>
     <l n="65">Of winds in the woods , and waves on pebbled bounds ,—</l>
     <l n="66">A song for oars to chime with , such as might</l>
     <l n="67">Be sung by tired sea-painters , who at night</l>
     <l n="68">Look from their hemlock camps , by quiet cove</l>
     <l n="69">Or beach , moon-lighted , on the waves they love .</l>

   <p>I inscribed this poem to Dr. Elias Weld of Haverhill , Massachusetts , to whose kindness I was much indebted in my boyhood . He was the one cultivated man in the neighborhood . His small but well-chosen library was placed at my disposal . He is the “ wise old doctor ” of Snow-Bound . Count Francois de Vipart with his cousin Joseph Rochemont de Poyen came to the United States in the early part of the present century . They took up their residence at Rocks Village on the Merrimac , where they both married . The wife of Count Vipart was Mary Ingalls , who as my father remembered her was a very lovely young girl . Her wedding dress , as described by a lady still living , was “ pink satin with an overdress of white lace , and white satin slippers . ” She died in less than a year after her marriage . Her husband returned to his native country . He lies buried in the family tomb of the Viparts at Bordeaux .</p>
