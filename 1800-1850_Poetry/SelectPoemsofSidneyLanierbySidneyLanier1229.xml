    <docTitle><titlePart>This edition of the ` Select Poems of Sidney Lanier ’ is issued in the hope of making his poetry known to wider circles than hitherto , especially among the students of our high-schools and colleges . To these as to older people , the poems will , it is believed , prove an inspiration from the stand-point both of literature and of life . The biographical section of the Introduction rests in the main upon Dr. Ward 's admirable ` Memorial ’ prefixed to the ` Poems of Sidney Lanier ’ edited by his wife , though a few additional facts have been gleaned here and there . For most * of the Bibliography down to 1888 I am indebted to my Hopkins comrade , Dr. Richard E. Burton , now of Hartford , Conn ., who compiled one for the ` Memorial of Sidney Lanier ’ , published by President Gilman , of the Johns Hopkins University , in 1888 . Obligations to other publications about Lanier are in every instance acknowledged in the appropriate place .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>* I say ` most of the Bibliography down to<date>1888</date>’ , because Dr. Burton 's different purpose led him to exclude items that could not be omitted in a Bibliography that , like mine , tries to be complete . As to the selections made , I wished to include ` The Marshes of Glynn ’ and yet not to exclude ` Sunrise ’ . But both could not be put in , and I finally gave the preference to ` Sunrise ’ , chiefly on the ground of its being Lanier 's latest complete poem . * I believe all will admit that the poems selected fairly exemplify the genius of the poet . The poems are arranged , not as in the complete edition , but in their chronological order , the only proper one , I think , for a text-book . Of course , they are all given complete . * Later opinion generally agrees that “ The Marshes of Glynn ” is Lanier 's greatest poem , and as this edition has no limitations of space , it would be inappropriate to exclude it . Therefore it has been inserted more or less in chronological order ( in accordance with Callaway 's plan ) , with some comments . — Alan Light ,<date>1998</date>. In the Notes I have made rather copious quotations from poems familiar to English scholars , because I hope that this book will go into the hands of many to whom they are not familiar , and to whom the original texts are not easily accessible . And yet , if they at all attain their end , the Notes must lead one to wish to know more of English poetry , of which Lanier 's is but a part .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Among the friends that have helped me by counsel or otherwise I gratefully name Mr. Clifford Lanier , brother of the poet ; Professor Wm . Hand Browne , of the Johns Hopkins University ; Dr. Charles H. Ross , of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute ; and my colleagues in the School of English in the University of Texas , Mr. L. R. Hamberlin and Professor Leslie Waggener . Chief-justice Logan E. Bleckley , of Georgia , a man of letters as well as of law , very kindly put at my use his correspondence with the poet , the original draft of ` Corn ’ , and his criticisms upon the same . My chief indebtedness , however , is to Mrs. Sidney Lanier , who has been most generous with her time and her husband 's papers .</titlePart></docTitle>

   <p>I . A Brief Sketch of Lanier 's Life</p>
   <p>( 1842-1881 )</p>
   <p>Sidney Lanier has so recently passed from us that it seems desirable briefly to recount the chief incidents of his life . This task is much lightened by Dr. Wm . Hayes Ward 's ` Memorial ’ ,* upon which , as stated in the Preface , is based this section of my essay . Born at Macon , Ga ., February 3 , 1842 , Sidney Lanier came of a family noted for their love and cultivation of the fine arts . From the time of Queen Elizabeth to the Restoration , several of his paternal ancestors were connected with the English court as musical composers and as painters . The father of the poet , however , Robert S. Lanier , was a most industrious lawyer , who , after a lingering illness of three years , recently ** answered ` Adsum ’ to the summons of the supreme tribunal . The poet 's mother , Mary Anderson , a Virginian of Scotch descent , likewise sprang from a family distinguished for their love of oratory , music , and poetry .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">* For the full title of works cited see ` Bibliography ’ .</l>
     <l n="2">** October 20 , 1893 , at Macon , Ga .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>With such an ancestry we are not surprised to learn that Sidney 's earliest passion was for music , and that in boyhood he could , although untutored , play on almost every kind of instrument . He preferred the violin , in playing which he sometimes sank into a deep trance , but in deference to his father 's view gave it up for the flute , his power over which we shall hear of farther on . At first , strange to say , he considered music unworthy of one 's sole attention , but later he came to rank it as his fullest expression of worship .</p>
   <p>At fourteen Sidney entered the Sophomore Class of Oglethorpe College , near Macon , Ga ., and , with a year 's intermission , graduated with first honor in 1860 , when just eighteen . To Professor James Woodrow , of Oglethorpe , now President of South Carolina College , Lanier declared that he owed “ the strongest and most valuable stimulus of his youth . ” On graduating he was given a tutorship in his Alma Mater , a position that he held until the outbreak of the Civil War .</p>
   <p>The lecture-room was now exchanged for the battle-field ; in April , 1861 , Lanier entered the Confederate Army as a private in the Macon Volunteers of the Second Georgia Battalion , an organization among the first to reach Norfolk and that still keeps up its corporate existence . In the spring of 1862 Lanier was joined by his young brother , Clifford ; and throughout the war each seemed to vie with the other in brotherly love ; for , while both were offered promotion , neither would accept it , since to do so would have entailed separation from the other . The leisure time of his first year 's service Sidney spent in the study of music and the modern languages . He was engaged in several battles in Virginia , but afterward was transferred , with Clifford , to the Signal Service , with head-quarters at Petersburg . Here he had access to a small library , of which he made sedulous use . In 1863 his company was mounted , and served in Virginia and North Carolina . In the spring of 1864 both brothers were transferred to Wilmington , the head-quarters of the Marine Signal Service , in which they remained to the end of the war . Finally the two brothers were separated , each becoming signal officer * of a blockade-runner . Sidney 's vessel was captured , and for five months he was a prisoner at Point Lookout , Md ., with nothing but his flute to solace him . It was the exposure of prison-life , no doubt , that first led to decline of health by developing the seeds of consumption , a disease that was to carry off his mother and that he was to struggle with the last fifteen years of his life . Released from prison in February , 1865 , he returned to Georgia , for the most part afoot , and reached home March 15th . An account of his war-life is given in his novel , ` Tiger-lilies ’ , treated below .</p>
   <p>* It is sometimes erroneously stated that each was put in charge of a blockade-runner .</p>
   <p>During the succeeding nine years ( 1865-73 ) his life was checkered indeed . Seriously ill for six weeks , he arose from his bed to see his mother carried off by consumption and to find himself suffering with congestion of the lungs . Slightly relieved , Lanier turned his hand to various projects for making a living : clerking in a hotel in Montgomery , Ala ., for two years ; writing * and publishing his novel , ` Tiger-lilies ’ ; teaching at Prattville , Ala ., one year , during which time ** he married Miss Mary Day , of Macon , Ga .; studying and then practising law with his father at Macon , Ga ., for five years ; now , in the winter of 1872-73 , trying to recuperate at San Antonio , Texas , for hemorrhages had begun in 1868 , and a cough had set in two years later ; and , finally , settling in Baltimore , December , 1873 , to devote himself to music and literature .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">* April , 1867 .</l>
     <l n="2">** December 19 , 1867 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Against the son 's devotion of his life to music and literature the father protested , chiefly on business grounds , and begged him to rejoin himself in the practice of the law . Thanking his father for his thoughtfulness , Lanier justified his own course in these earnest words : “ My dear father , think how , for twenty years , through poverty , through pain , through weariness , through sickness , through the uncongenial atmosphere of a farcical college and of a bare army and then of an exacting business life , through all the discouragement of being wholly unacquainted with literary people and literary ways — I say , think how , in spite of all these depressing circumstances and of a thousand more which I could enumerate , these two figures of music and poetry have steadily kept in my heart so that I could not banish them . Does it not seem to you as to me , that I begin to have the right to enroll myself among the devotees of these two sublime arts , after having followed them so long and so humbly , and through so much bitterness ? "* 1 * Of course , the father yielded and did all that his slender means would allow toward keeping up his son , who henceforth devoted every energy to music and literature . Despite continued ill-health , which now and again necessitated visits of months ’ duration to Florida , North Carolina , and Virginia , Lanier did a vast amount of work . He was engaged as first flute for the Peabody Symphony Concerts , a position that he filled with rare distinction for six years . As to his literary work , this began with the publication of his novel , ` Tiger-lilies ’ , in 1867 , and in the same year , of occasional poems in ` The Round Table ’ of New York . ` Corn ’ , published in ` Lippincott 's Magazine ’ ( Philadelphia ) for February , 1875 , is the first of his poems that attracted general notice , and the one that gained him the friendship of Bayard Taylor . To Taylor he owed his selection to write the ` Centennial Cantata ’ , which gave him still greater notoriety , though , to be sure , some of it was not very grateful to him . In 1876 the Lippincotts published his ` Florida ’ , and in 1877 his first volume of ` Poems ’ , which contained ninety-four pages and consisted chiefly of pieces * 2 * previously published in the magazines . Soon after settling in Baltimore , Lanier made a careful study of Old and Middle English , the fruits of which he partially embodied in courses of lectures given to his private class and to the public , the latter at the Peabody Institute , in 1879 . During these years , too , he had been steadily turning out poems of high order . On his birthday , February 3 , in 1879 , he received notice of his appointment as Lecturer on English Literature at the Johns Hopkins University of Baltimore for the ensuing scholastic year , with a fixed salary , the first since his marriage . In the summer of 1879 he wrote his ` Science of English Verse ’ , which constituted the basis of his first course of lectures at the Johns Hopkins University . Notwithstanding serious illness , this same winter , 1879-80 , he lectured at three private schools and kept up his musical engagement at the Peabody Concerts . The next winter , 1880-81 , he came near dying , but still kept writing (` Sunrise ’ was written with a fever temperature of 104 Degrees ) and went through his twelve lectures at the Hopkins , afterwards embodied in ` The English Novel ’ . How trying this must have been to him can be gathered from the following words of Mr. Ward : “ A few of the earlier lectures he penned himself ; the rest he was obliged to dictate to his wife . With the utmost care of himself , going in a closed carriage and sitting during his lecture , his strength was so exhausted that the struggle for breath in the carriage on his return seemed each time to threaten the end . Those who heard him listened in a sort of fascinated terror , as in doubt whether the hoarded breath would suffice to the end of the hour . "* 3 * After this a trip was made to New York to arrange for issuing some books for boys , and four were issued , two posthumously : ` Boy 's Froissart ’ ( 1878 ) , ` Boy 's King Arthur ’ ( 1880 ) , ` Boy 's Mabinogion ’ ( 1881 ) , and ` Boy 's Percy ’ ( 1882 ) . Another work , an account of North Carolina similar to that of Florida , was contracted for and was definitely planned , but , owing to aggravating infirmities , could not be completed .</p>

   <p>For the end was near at hand . Desperate illness had made it necessary to seek relief near Asheville , N. C ., where he was joined by Mrs. Lanier and by his father and step-mother . Growing no better , he was moved to Lynn , Polk County , N. C. Of the rest we shall hear in the words of his wife : “ We are left alone ( it is August 29 , 1881 ) with one another . On the last night of the summer comes a change . His love and immortal will hold off the destroyer of our summer yet one more week , until the forenoon of September 7th , and then falls the frost , and that unfaltering will renders its supreme submission to the will of God . "* Unusually checkered his life had been , and yet for Lanier as for Timrod poetry ( and music ) had “ turned life 's tasteless waters into wine , and flushed them through and through with purple tints . "** The body was taken to Mr. Lanier 's home in Baltimore , thence to the Church of St. Michael and All Angels , where services were conducted by the rector , the Rev . Dr. William Kirkus . It was then buried in Greenmount Cemetery , in the lot of Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence Turnbull , two of the dearest friends that Mr. and Mrs. Lanier had in Baltimore .</p>

   <p>Mr. Lanier left a family consisting of his wife and four sons . Mrs. Lanier , who lives at Tryon , N. C ., was the inspiration not only of those glorious tributes , ` Laus Mariae ’ and ` My Springs ’ , but also of the poet 's whole life . The eldest son , Mr. Charles Day Lanier , was born at Macon , Ga ., September 12 , 1868 , and was graduated A. B . at the Johns Hopkins University in 1888 . At one time he was Assistant Editor of ` The Cosmopolitan Magazine ’ , a position that he gave up only to become Business Manager of ` The Review of Reviews ’ , with which he has been connected from its beginning . He is the author of several graceful sketches in the magazines . The second son , Sidney , is passionately fond of music , and would have devoted himself thereto but for life-long ill-health . After teaching three years in West Virginia , he has started a fruit farm at Tryon , N. C ., where he hopes to build up his health . The third son , Henry Wysham , was prevented from entering the Johns Hopkins by a partial failure of sight , and for three years has devoted himself to railroad engineering in Baltimore and in Jamaica . The youngest , Robert Sampson , only fourteen , is at Tryon , N. C ., with his mother .</p>
   <p>That interest in Lanier 's life and work did not cease with his death , there is abundant evidence . On October 22 , 1881 , a memorial meeting was held by the Faculty and students of the Johns Hopkins University , at which addresses * 1 * were made by President Gilman and Professor Wm . Hand Browne , of the University , and by the Rev . Dr. William Kirkus , of Baltimore , and a letter * 1 * was read from the poet-critic , Edmund C. Stedman , of New York . In 1883 ` The English Novel ’ was published , and in 1884 the ` Poems ’ , edited by his wife , with the excellent ` Memorial ’ by Dr. Wm . Hayes Ward , who declared that he thought Lanier would “ take his final rank with the first princes of American song . "* 2 * Numerous reviews of his life and works were published , notably those by Mr. Wm . R. Thayer , Dr. Merrill E. Gates , Professor Charles W. Kent , and by the London ` Spectator ’ . On February 3 , 1888 , the Johns Hopkins University held another memorial meeting in Baltimore , attended by many from other cities . “ A bust of the poet , in bronze ( modelled by Ephraim Keyser , sculptor , in the last period of Lanier 's life , at the suggestion of Mr. J. R. Tait ) , was presented to the University by his kinsman , Charles Lanier , Esq ., of New York . It was also announced that a citizen of Baltimore had offered a pedestal , to be cut in Georgia marble from a design by Mr. J . B. N. Wyatt . On a temporary pedestal hung the flute of Lanier , which had so often been his solace , and a roll of his manuscript music . The bust was crowned with a wreath of laurel ; the words of Lanier , ` The Time needs Heart ’ , were woven into the strings of a floral lyre ; and other flowers , likewise brought by personal friends , were grouped around the pedestal . As a memento a card , designed by Mrs. Henry Whitman , of Boston , was given to those who were present . Upon its face was a wreath , with Lanier 's name and the date , and the motto — ` Aspiro dum Exspiro ’ ; upon the reverse appeared the closing lines of the Hymn of the Sun , taken from the poet 's ` Hymns of the Marshes ’ — and beneath , a flute with ivy twined about it . "* 3 * The exercises , which were interspersed with music , were as follows : addresses by President Gilman of the Hopkins and President Gates of Rutgers ( now of Amherst ) ; selections from Lanier 's poetry , read by Miss Susan Hayes Ward , of Newark , N. J .; a paper on Lanier 's ` Science of English Verse ’ , by Professor A. H. Tolman , of Ripon College , Wis. ( now of the University of Chicago ) ; poetic tributes by Mrs. Lawrence Turnbull , Miss Edith M. Thomas , and Messrs. James Cummings , Richard E. Burton , and John B. Tabb ; and letters from Messrs. Richard W. Gilder , Edmund C. Stedman , and James Russell Lowell — all of which may be found in President Gilman 's dainty ` Memorial of Sidney Lanier ’ . Again , a replica of the above-mentioned bust , the gift also of Mr. Charles Lanier , was unveiled at the poet 's birthplace , Macon , Ga ., on October 17 , 1890 ; on which occasion tender tributes * 4 * were again poured forth in prose and verse , by Messrs. W. B. Hill , Hugh V. Washington , Charles Lanier , Clifford Lanier , Wm . Hand Browne , Charles G. D. Roberts , John B. Tabb , H. S. Edwards , Wm . H. Hayne , Charles W. Hubner , Joel Chandler Harris , Charles Dudley Warner , and Daniel C. Gilman . But more significant than these demonstrations , perhaps , is the steadily growing study devoted to Lanier 's works . Mr. Higginson * 5 * tells us , for instance , that , when he wrote his tribute in 1887 , Lanier 's ` Science of English Verse ’ had been put upon the list of Harvard books to be kept only a fortnight , and that , according to the librarian , it was out “ literally all the time . ” Moreover , it would not be difficult to cite various poems that have been more or less modeled upon Lanier 's ; it is sufficient , perhaps , to point out that the marsh , a theme almost unknown to poetry before Lanier immortalized it , is not infrequently the subject of poetic treatment now , as in the works of Charles G. D. Roberts ,* 6 * Clinton Scollard ,* 7 * and Maurice Thompson . * 8 * It is noteworthy , too , that many of the younger poets of the day , both in Canada and the United States , have sung Lanier 's praise . A complete list is given in the ` Bibliography ’ . Still further , a devoted admirer , Mrs. Lawrence Turnbull , of Baltimore , in ` The Catholic Man ’ , has in the person of Paul , the poet , given us an imaginative study of the character of Mr. Lanier . Finally , only a few months ago the Chautauquans of the class of 1898 determined to call themselves “ The Laniers ” , in honor of the poet and his brother .</p>

     <l n="9">II . Lanier 's Prose Works</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>With this brief sketch of his life , let us turn to Lanier 's works , and first to those in prose . At the head of the list comes ` Tiger-lilies ’ , a novel written within three weeks and published immediately thereafter , in 1867 . Under the figure of “ a strange , enormous , terrible flower , ” the seed of which he hopes may perish beyond resurrection , the author pictures the horror of war in general and of the Civil War in particular . An entertaining love-story runs through the book , the plot of which space does not allow me to detail . In execution the novel has grave defects : it lacks unity ; the characters talk as learnedly as Lanier afterward wrote of music ; and at times , as in the oft-quoted picture of the war ,* 1 * the style is grandiloquent ; owing to which blemishes the author wisely discouraged its republication . But , in spite of these defects , the book has one very strongly put scene ,* 2 * the interview between Smallin and his deserter brother , and several beautiful passages * 3 * that distinctly proclaim the high-souled poet .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Lanier 's next publication , ` Florida : Its Scenery , Climate , and History ’ , was written by commission of the Atlantic Coast Line , and appeared in 1876 . To use the author 's own epithet , ` Florida ’ is “ a spiritualized guide-book ” .</p>
   <p>Exclusive of the 1877 volume of ` Poems ’ , Lanier 's next original work was ` The Science of English Verse ’ , which in lecture-form was delivered to the students of the Johns Hopkins in the winter of 1879 and was published in 1880 . According to competent critics , the book gives as searching an investigation of the science of verse on its formal side as is to be had in any language . Since the treatise is so evidently an epoch-making one , I regret that the technicality of the subject forbids my attempting in this connection even a brief exposition * of its principles . I can say only that Lanier treats verse in the terms of music ; that , according to the promise of the preface , he gives “ an account of the true relations of music and verse ” ; and that in so doing he has given us the best working theory for English verse from Caedmon to Tennyson . This is a high estimate , but it is by no means so high as that of the lamented poet-professor , Edmund Rowland Sill , who said of ` The Science of English Verse ’ , “ It is the only work that has ever made any approach to a rational view of the subject . Nor are the standard ones overlooked in making this assertion . "**</p>
   <p>* This may be found in Professor Tolman 's article , cited in the ` Bibliography ’ . ** Quoted by Tolman .</p>
   <p>Lanier 's second course of lectures at the Johns Hopkins University , delivered in the winter and spring of 1881 , was published in 1883 under the title , ` The English Novel and the Principles of Its Development ’ . * According to the author 's statement , the purpose of the book is “ first , to inquire what is the special relation of the novel to the modern man , by virtue of which it has become a paramount literary form ; and , secondly , to illustrate this abstract inquiry , when completed , by some concrete readings in the greatest of modern English novelists ” ( p. 4 ) . Addressing himself to the former , Lanier attempts to prove ( 1 ) that our time , when compared with that of Aeschylus , shows an “ enormous growth in the personality of man ” ( p. 5 ) ; ( 2 ) that what we moderns call Physical Science , Music , and the Novel , all had their origin at practically the same time , about the middle of the seventeenth century ( p. 9 ) ; and ( 3 ) “ that the increase of personalities thus going on has brought about such complexities of relation that the older forms of expression were inadequate to them ; and that the resulting necessity has developed the wonderfully free and elastic form of the modern novel out of the more rigid Greek drama , through the transition form of the Elizabethan drama ” ( p. 10 ) . In fulfilment of his second purpose , the author gives a detailed study of several of the novels of George Eliot , whom he takes to be the greatest modern English novelist . Even this brief synopsis of the book must indicate its broad and stimulating character , in which respect it is a worthy successor of ` The Science of English Verse ’ . Despite the limitations induced by failing life , which necessitated the cutting down of the course of lectures from twenty to twelve ,** I know of few more life-giving books ; and I venture to assert that it cannot safely be overlooked by any careful student of the subject .</p>
   <p>* Mrs. Lanier informs me that ` The English Novel ’ will soon be issued in an amended form and with a new sub-title , ` Studies in the Development of Personality ’ , which indicates precisely what Mr. Lanier intended to attempt , and relieves the book of its seeming incompleteness as to scope . ** ` Spann ’ .</p>
   <p>Among other prose works I may mention Lanier 's early extravaganza , ` Three Waterfalls ’ ; ` Bob ’ , a happy account of a pet mocking-bird , worthy of being placed beside Dr. Brown 's ` Rab and his Friends ’ ; his books for boys : ` Froissart ’ , ` King Arthur ’ , ` Mabinogion ’ , and ` Percy ’ , which have had , as they deserve , a large sale ; and his posthumous ` From Bacon to Beethoven ’ , a highly instructive essay on music .</p>
   <p>III . Lanier 's Poetry : Its Themes</p>
   <p>But it is chiefly as a poet that we wish to consider Lanier , and I turn to the posthumous edition of his ` Poems ’ gotten out by his wife . At the outset let us ask , How did the poet look at the world ? what problems engaged his attention and how were they solved ? A careful investigation will show , I believe , that , despite the brevity of his life and its consuming cares , Lanier studied the chief questions of our age , and that in his poems he has offered us noteworthy solutions .</p>
   <p>What , for instance , is more characteristic of our age than its tendency to agnosticism ? I pass by the manifestations of this spirit in the world of religion , of which so much has been heard , and give an illustration or two from the field of history and politics . Picturesque Pocahontas , we are told , is no more to be believed in ; moreover , the Pilgrim Fathers did not land at Plymouth Rock , nor did Jefferson write the Declaration of Independence . Which way we turn there is a big interrogation-point , often not for information but for negation . Of the good resulting from the inquisitive spirit , we all know ; of the baneful influence of inquisitiveness that has become a mere intellectual pastime or amateurish agnosticism , we likewise have some knowledge ; but the evil side of this tendency has seldom been put more forcibly , I think , than in this stanza from Lanier 's ` Acknowledgment ':</p>

   <p>More hurtful than agnosticism , because affecting larger masses of people , is the rapid growth of the mercantile spirit during the present century , especially in America . This evil the poet saw most clearly and felt most keenly , as every one may learn by reading ` The Symphony ’ , his great poem in which the speakers are the various musical instruments . The violins begin :</p>
   <p>“ O Trade ! O Trade ! would thou wert dead ! The Time needs heart — ‘ tis tired of head . "*</p>
   <p>Then all the stringed instruments join with the violins in giving the wail of the poor , who “ stand wedged by the pressing of Trade 's hand ":</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ ` We weave in the mills and heave in the kilns ,</l>

     <l n="12">“ Man shall not live by bread alone</l>

     <l n="15">But Trade saith “ No ":</l>
     <l n="16">And the kilns and the curt-tongued mills say “ Go :</l>

     <l n="18">Move out , if you think you 're underpaid .</l>
     <l n="19">The poor are prolific ; we 're not afraid ;</l>

   <p>Of even wider sweep than mercantilism is the spirit of intolerance ; for , while the diffusion of knowledge and of grace has in a measure repressed this spirit , it lacks much of being subdued . I do not wonder that Lanier “ fled in tears from men 's ungodly quarrel about God , ” and that , in his poem entitled ` Remonstrance ’ , he denounces intolerance with all the vehemence of a prophet of old .</p>
   <p>But Lanier had an eye for life 's beauties as well as its ills . To him music was one of earth 's chief blessings . Of his early passion for the violin and his substitution of the flute therefor , we have already learned . According to competent critics he was possibly the greatest flute-player * 1 * in the world , a fact all the more interesting when we remember that , as he himself tells us ,* 2 * he never had a teacher . With such a talent for music the poet has naturally strewn his pages with fine tributes thereto . In ` Tiger-lilies ’ , for instance , he tells us that , while explorers say that they have found some nations that had no god , he knows of none that had no music , and then sums up the matter in this sentence : “ Music means harmony ; harmony means love ; and love means — God ! "* 3 * Even more explicit is this declaration in a letter of May , 1873 , to Hayne : “ I do n't know that I 've told you that whatever turn I may have for art is purely MUSICAL ; poetry being with me A MERE TANGENT INTO WHICH I SHOOT SOMETIMES . I could play passably on several instruments before I could write legibly , and SINCE then the very deepest of my life has been filled with music , which I have studied and cultivated far more than poetry . "* 4 * We have already seen incidentally that in his ` Symphony ’ the speakers are musical instruments ; and it is in this poem that occurs his felicitous definition ,</p>
   <p>“ Music is love in search of a word . "* 5 *</p>
   <p>In ` To Beethoven ’ he describes the effect of music upon himself :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ I know not how , I care not why ,</l>
     <l n="2">Thy music brings this broil at ease ,</l>
     <l n="3">And melts my passion 's mortal cry</l>
     <l n="4">In satisfying symphonies .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ Yea , it forgives me all my sins ,</l>
     <l n="6">Fits life to love like rhyme to rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="7">And tunes the task each day begins</l>
     <l n="8">By the last trumpet-note of Time . "* 6 *</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>It was this profound knowledge of music , of course , that enabled Lanier to write his work on ` The Science of English Verse ’ , and gave him a technical skill in versification akin to that of Tennyson .</p>

     <l n="6">from this sentence to Judge Bleckley , in his letter of March 20 , 1876 :</l>
     <l n="7">“ As for me , life has resolved simply into a time during which</l>
     <l n="8">I must get upon paper as many as possible of the poems</l>

   <p>Like most great poets of modern times , Lanier was a sincere lover of nature . And it seems to me that with him this love was as all-embracing as with Wordsworth . Lanier found beauty in the waving corn * 1 * and the clover ;* 2 * in the mocking-bird ,* 3 * the robin ,* 4 * and the dove ;* 5 * in the hickory ,* 6 * the dogwood ,* 6 * and the live-oak ;* 7 * in the murmuring leaves * 8 * and the chattering streams ;* 9 * in the old red hills * 10 * and the sea ;* 11 * in the clouds ,* 12 * sunrise ,* 13 * and sunset ;* 14 * and even in the marshes ,* 15 * which “ burst into bloom ” for this worshiper . Again , Lanier 's love of nature was no less insistent than Wordsworth 's . We all remember the latter 's oft-quoted lines :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ To me the meanest flower that blows can give</l>
     <l n="2">Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears ;"* 16 *</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">and beside them one may put this line of Lanier 's ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">“ The little green leaves would not let me alone in my sleep ,"* 17 *</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="5">because , as the context shows , he was</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="6">“ Shaken with happiness :</l>
     <l n="7">The gates of sleep stood wide . "* 18 *</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>And how naive and tender was this nature-worship ! He speaks of the clover * 19 * and the clouds * 20 * as cousins , and of the leaves * 21 * as sisters , and in so doing reminds us of the earliest Italian poetry , especially of ` The Canticle of the Sun ’ , by St. Francis of Assisi , who brothers the wind , the fire , and the sun , and sisters the water , the stars , and the moon . Notice the tenderness in these lines of ` Corn ':</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ The leaves that wave against my cheek caress</l>
     <l n="2">Like women 's hands ; the embracing boughs express</l>
     <l n="3">A subtlety of mighty tenderness ;</l>
     <l n="4">The copse-depths into little noises start ,</l>
     <l n="5">That sound anon like beatings of a heart ,</l>
     <l n="6">Anon like talk ‘ twixt lips not far apart ;"* 22 *</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">to which we find a beautiful parallel in a poem by Paul Hamilton Hayne ,</l>
     <l n="8">himself a reverent nature-worshiper :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">“ Ah ! Nature seems</l>
     <l n="10">Through something sweeter than all dreams</l>
     <l n="11">To woo me ; yea , she seems to speak</l>
     <l n="12">How closely , kindly , her fond cheek</l>
     <l n="13">Rested on mine , her mystic blood</l>
     <l n="14">Pulsing in tender neighborhood ,</l>
     <l n="15">And soft as any mortal maid ,</l>
     <l n="16">Half veiled in the twilight shade ,</l>
     <l n="17">Who leans above her love to tell</l>
     <l n="18">Secrets almost ineffable ! "* 23 *</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">Moreover , this worship is restful :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="20">“ Oh , what is abroad in the marsh and the terminal sea ?</l>
     <l n="21">Somehow my soul seems suddenly free</l>
     <l n="22">From the weighing of fate and the sad discussion of sin ,</l>
     <l n="23">By the length and the breadth and the sweep of the marshes of Glynn .</l>

    </lg>

   <p>But to Lanier the ministration of nature was by no means passive ; and we find him calling upon the leaves actively to minister to his need and even to intercede for him to their Maker :</p>

   <p>To take up his next theme , Lanier , like every true Teuton , from Tacitus to the present , saw “ something of the divine ” in woman . It was this feeling that led him so severely to condemn a vice that is said to be growing , the marriage for convenience . I quote from ` The Symphony ’ , and the “ melting Clarionet ” is speaking :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ So hath Trade withered up Love 's sinewy prime ,</l>
     <l n="2">Men love not women as in olden time .</l>
     <l n="3">Ah , not in these cold merchantable days</l>
     <l n="4">Deem men their life an opal gray , where plays</l>
     <l n="5">The one red sweet of gracious ladies ’ - praise .</l>
     <l n="6">Now , comes a suitor with sharp prying eye —</l>
     <l n="7">Says , ` Here , you lady , if you 'll sell , I 'll buy :</l>
     <l n="8">Come , heart for heart — a trade ? What ! weeping ? why ? ’</l>
     <l n="9">Shame on such wooer 's dapper-mercery ! "* 1 *</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And then follows a wooing that , to my mind , should be irresistible , and that , at any rate , is quite as high-souled as Browning 's ` One Way of Love ’ , which I have long considered the high-water-mark of the chivalrous in love . The Lady Clarionet is still speaking :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ I would my lover kneeling at my feet</l>
     <l n="2">In humble manliness should cry , ` O Sweet !</l>

     <l n="4">I ask not if thy love my love can meet :</l>
     <l n="5">Whate'er thy worshipful soft tongue shall say ,</l>
     <l n="6">I 'll kiss thine answer , be it yea or nay :</l>

   <p>To Lanier there was but one thing that made life worth living , and that was love . Even the superficial reader must be struck with the frequent use of the term in the poet 's works , while all must be uplifted by his conception of its purpose and power . The ills of agnosticism , mercantilism , and intolerance all find their solution here and here only , as is admirably set forth in ` The Symphony ’ , of which the opening strain is , “ We are all for love , ” and the closing , “ Love alone can do . ” The matter is no less happily put in ` Tiger-lilies ': “ For I am quite confident that love is the only rope thrown out by Heaven to us who have fallen overboard into life . Love for man , love for woman , love for God , — these three chime like bells in a steeple and call us to worship , which is to work . . . . Inasmuch as we love , in so much do we conquer death and flesh ; by as much as we love , by so much are we gods . For God is love ; and could we love as He does , we could be as He is . "* 1 * To the same effect is his statement in ` The English Novel ': “ A republic is the government of the spirit . "* 2 * The same thought recurs later : “ In love , and love only , can great work that not only pulls down , but builds , be done ; it is love , and love only , that is truly constructive in art . "* 3 * In the poem entitled ` How Love Looked for Hell ’ , Mind and Sense at Love 's request go to seek Hell ; but ever as they point it out to Love , whether in the material or the immaterial world , it vanishes ; for where Love is there can be no Hell , since , in the words of Tolstoi 's story , “ Where Love is there is God . ” But in one of his poems Lanier sums up the whole matter in a line :</p>
   <p>“ When life 's all love , ‘ tis life : aught else , ‘ tis naught . "* 4 *</p>

   <p>It is but a short way from love to its source , — God . And , as Lanier was continually in the atmosphere of the one , so , I believe , he was ever in the presence of the other ; for the poet 's “ Love means God ” is but another phrasing of the evangelist 's “ God is love ” . * 1 * Of Lanier 's grief over church broils and of his longing for freedom to worship God according to one 's own intuition , we have already learned from his ` Remonstrance ’ . What he thought of the Christ we learn from ` The Crystal ’ , which closes with this invocation :</p>

     <l n="12">Jesus , good Paragon , Thou Crystal Christ ? "* 2 *</l>
   </lg>
   <p>How tenderly Lanier was touched by the life of our Lord may be seen in his ` Ballad of Trees and the Master ’ , a dramatic presentation of the scene in Gethsemane and on Calvary . How implicit was his trust in the Christ may be gathered from this paragraph in a letter to the elder Hayne : “ I have a boy whose eyes are blue as your ` Aethra 's ’ . Every day when my work is done I take him in my strong arms , and lift him up , and pore in his face . The intense repose , penetrated somehow with a thrilling mystery of ` potential activity ’ , which dwells in his large , open eye , teaches me new things . I say to myself , Where are the strong arms in which I , too , might lay me and repose , and yet be full of the fire of life ? And always through the twilight come answers from the other world , ` Master ! Master ! there is one — Christ — in His arms we rest ! '"* 3 * Perhaps , however , Lanier 's notion of God , whom he declared * 4 * all his roads reached , is most clearly expressed in a scrap quoted by Ward , apparently the outline for a poem : “ I fled in tears from the men 's ungodly quarrel about God . I fled in tears to the woods , and laid me down on the earth . Then somewhat like the beating of many hearts came up to me out of the ground ; and I looked and my cheek lay close to a violet . Then my heart took courage , and I said : ` I know that thou art the word of my God , dear Violet . And oh , the ladder is not long that to my heaven leads . Measure what space a violet stands above the ground . ‘ Tis no further climbing that my soul and angels have to do than that . '"* 5 * In this high spirituality Lanier is in line with the greatest poets of our race , from</p>

   <p>Perhaps I may append here a paragraph upon Lanier 's criticisms of other writers , for they seem to me acute in the extreme . Despite the elaborate essays in defence of Whitman 's poetry by Dowden ,* 1 * Symonds ,* 2 * and Whitman himself , I believe Lanier is right in declaring that “ Whitman is poetry 's butcher . Huge raw collops slashed from the rump of poetry and never mind gristle — is what Whitman feeds our souls with . As near as I can make it out , Whitman 's argument seems to be , that , because a prairie is wide , therefore debauchery is admirable , and because the Mississippi is long , therefore every American is God . "* 3 * Notice , again , how well the defect of ` Paradise Lost ’ is pointed out :</p>

     <l n="26">IV . Lanier 's Poetry : Its Style</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>So much for the poet 's thoughts ; what shall we say of their expression ? In other words , is Lanier the literary artist equal to Lanier the seer ? In order the better to answer this question , let us begin at the beginning , with the elements of style , some of which , however , I pass by as not calling for special comment .</p>
   <p>Of Lanier 's felicitous choice of words we have already had incidental illustration ; but it is desirable , perhaps , to group here a few of his happiest phrases , to show that , as Lowell * 1 * said , he is “ a man of genius with a rare gift for the happy word . ” Notice this speech about the brook :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ And down the hollow from a ferny nook</l>

    </lg>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="11">“ Death 's and truth 's unlocking time . "* 6 *</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Moreover , it should be observed that Lanier frequently uses significant compounds , — a habit acquired , no doubt , from his study of Old English , in which , as in German , such compounds abound .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">* 1 * See ` Lowell ’ in ` Bibliography ’ .</l>
     <l n="2">* 2 * ` From the Flats ’ , ll . 23-24 ; cited by Gates . [ Line 24 was changed</l>
     <l n="3">( to “ Bright leaps a living brook ! ” ) in later editions . — A. L ., 1998 . ]</l>
     <l n="4">* 3 * ` Clover ’ , ll . 29-30 .</l>
     <l n="5">* 4 * ` Sunrise ’ , l. 57 ; cited by Gates .</l>
     <l n="6">* 5 * ` The Mocking-Bird ’ , l. 14 .</l>
     <l n="7">* 6 * ` The Crystal ’ , l. 1 . Other illustrations may be found in the paragraph</l>
     <l n="8">on figures of speech .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>While in the main Lanier 's sentence-construction is good , occasionally his sentences are too long , as in ` My Springs ’ , ` To Bayard Taylor ’ , and ` Sunrise ’ , in which we have sentences longer than the opening one in ` Paradise Lost ’ , and , what is of more moment , not so well balanced , and hence affording fewer breathing spaces . That this detracts from clearness and euphony both , every reader will admit .</p>
   <p>To come to the figures of speech , one must be struck at once with the delicacy and the vigor of Lanier 's imagination . The poet 's fancy personifies what at first blush seems to us incapable of personification . Thus at one time * 1 * he likens men to clover-leaves and the Course-of-things to the browsing ox , which makes way with the clover-heads ; while at another he addresses an old red hill of Georgia as</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Thou gashed and hairy Lear</l>
     <l n="2">Whom the divine Cordelia of the year ,</l>
     <l n="3">E'en pitying Spring , will vainly strive to cheer . "* 2 *</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Like other Southern poets ,* 3 * Lanier sometimes fails to check his imagination , and in consequence leaves his readers “ bramble-tangled in a brilliant maze , ” as in his description of the stars in ` June Dreams '* 4 * and in the ` Psalm of the West ’ . * 5 * While I do not like a maze , brilliant though it be and sweet , I must say that I prefer the embarrassment of riches to the embarrassment of poverty . On the whole , however , Lanier 's figures strike me as singularly fresh and happy . In ` Sunrise ’ , for example , the poet speaks of the marsh as follows :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ The tide 's at full : the marsh with flooded streams</l>
     <l n="2">Glimmers a limpid labyrinth of dreams ;"* 6 *</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">and of the heavens reflected in the marsh waters :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">“ Each winding creek in grave entrancement lies</l>
     <l n="5">A rhapsody of morning-stars . The skies</l>
     <l n="6">Shine scant with one forked galaxy , —</l>
     <l n="7">The marsh brags ten : looped on his breast they lie . "* 7 *</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="8">Later , as the ebb-tide flows from marsh to sea , we are parenthetically treated</l>
     <l n="9">to these two lines :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="10">“ Run home , little streams ,</l>
     <l n="11">With your lapfuls of stars and dreams . "* 8 *</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="12">Finally , the heaven itself is thus pictured :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="13">“ Now in each pettiest personal sphere of dew</l>
     <l n="14">The summ 'd morn shines complete as in the blue</l>
     <l n="15">Big dew-drop of all heaven ;"* 9 *</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="16">beside which must be hung this exquisite picture :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="17">“ The dew-drop morn may fall from off the petal of the sky . "* 10 *</l>

   </lg>
   <p>As to versification , Lanier uses almost all the types of verse — iambic , trochaic , blank , the sonnet , etc . — and with about equal skill . Three features , however , specially characterize his verse : the careful distribution of vowel-colors and the frequent use of alliteration and of phonetic syzygy ,* 1 * by which last is meant a combination or succession of identical or similar consonants , whether initially , medially , or finally , as for instance the succession of M 's in Tennyson 's</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The moan of doves in immemorial elms</l>
     <l n="2">And murmuring of innumerable bees . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>All of these phenomena are illustrated in Lanier 's ` Song of the Chattahoochee ’ , which has often been compared to Tennyson 's ` The Brook ’ , and which alone proves the author a master in versification . To be sure , Lanier occasionally gives us an improper rhyme , as ` thwart : heart ’ ,* 2 * etc ., but so does every poet . No doubt , too , his love of music sometimes led him , not “ to strain for form effects ” , but to indulge too much therein , or , in the words of Mr. Stedman , “ to essay in language feats that only the gamut can render possible . "* 3 * But , as Professor Kent admirably puts it , “ Lanier was a poet as well as an artist , and if at times his artistic temperament seemed to eclipse his poetic thought , grant that to the poet mind the very manner of expression may indicate the thought that lies beneath , while to the duller ear the thought must come in completed form . "* 4 * Moreover , as we shall see later , this extraordinary musical endowment gave Lanier a unique position among English poets .</p>

     <l n="5">* 4 * ` Kent ’ , p. 60 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>After what has been said the qualities of style may be briefly handled . As we have already seen , Lanier sometimes fails in clearness , or , more precisely , in simplicity . This comes partly from infelicitous sentence-construction , partly , perhaps , from Lanier 's extraordinary musical endowment , but chiefly , I think , from over-luxuriance of imagination . But this occasional defect has been unduly exaggerated . Thus Mr. Gosse * 1 * declares that Lanier is “ never simple , never easy , never in one single lyric natural and spontaneous for more than one stanza , ” — a statement so clearly hyperbolic as hardly to call for notice . As a matter of fact , Lanier has written numerous poems that offer little or no difficulty to the reader of average intelligence , as ` Life and Song ’ , ` My Springs ’ , ` The Symphony ’ , ` The Mocking-Bird ’ , ` The Song of the Chattahoochee ’ , ` The Waving of the Corn ’ , ` The Revenge of Hamish ’ , ` Remonstrance ’ , ` A Ballad of Trees and the Master ’ , etc . More than this , Lanier at times manifests the simplicity that is granted only to genius of the highest order : thus an English critic ,* 2 * who by the way declares that Lanier 's volume has more of genius than all the poems of Poe , or Longfellow , or Lowell ( the humorous poems excepted ) , and who considers Lanier the most original of all American poets , and more original than any England has produced for the last thirty years , says that “ nothing can be more perfect than —</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">` The whole sweet round</l>
     <l n="2">Of littles that large life compound ,'"* 3 *</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">lines in ` My Springs ’ , and that “ the touch of wonder in the last two lines ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">` I marvel that God made you mine ,</l>
     <l n="5">For when he frowns , ‘ tis then ye shine ,'* 4 *</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>is as simple and exquisite as any touch of tenderness in our literature . ” I frankly admit that several of Lanier 's best poems , as ` Corn ’ , ` The Marshes of Glynn ’ , and ` Sunrise ’ , are not simple ; but the same thing is true of Milton 's ` Paradise Lost ’ and of Browning 's ` The Ring and the Book ’ , and yet this fact does not exclude these two works from the list of great poems . Mr. Gosse , however , declares that ` Corn ’ , ` Sunrise ’ , and ` The Marshes of Glynn ’ “ simulate poetic expression with extraordinary skill . But of the real thing , of the genuine traditional article , not a trace ” ! What do these poems show , then ? Mr. Gosse answers : “ I find a painful effort , a strain and rage , the most prominent qualities in everything he wrote ; ” which strikes me as the reverse of the facts . In one of his letters * 5 * to Judge Bleckley , Lanier wrote this sentence : “ My head and my heart are both so full of poems which the dreadful struggle for bread does not give me time to put on paper , that I am often driven to headache and heartache , purely for want of an hour or two to hold a pen . ” If , then , he committed an error ( and I am far from considering him faultless ) , it was not that he beat and spurred on Pegasus , but that he failed to rein him in . Still , I repeat that I prefer the embarrassment of riches to the embarrassment of poverty . Finally , just as Milton tells us that the music of the spheres is not to be heard by the gross , unpurged ear , so I believe that many intelligent ears and eyes are at first too gross to hear and see what Lanier puts before them , whereas a bit of patient listening and looking reveals delights hitherto undreamed of .</p>

     <l n="6">I quote from one dated November 15 , 1874 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>If not always simple , Lanier is often forcible in the extreme , as in ` The Symphony ’ , ` The Revenge of Hamish ’ , ` Remonstrance ’ , and ` Sunrise ’ . Of course , it is open to any one to see in these poems the “ rage ” attributed to Lanier by Mr. Gosse , but I prefer to consider it divine wrath in all but the last , and in it wonder unutterable , which yet is so uttered that ears become eyes . I allude to the stanzas * describing the break of dawn and the rising of the sun .</p>
   <p>* ` Sunrise ’ , ll . 86-152 .</p>
   <p>Of the poet 's marvelous euphony , ` The Song of the Chattahoochee ’ speaks clearly enough . As we have seen in our treatment of versification , it is here a question not of too little but of too much . But , despite an occasional too great yielding to his passion for music , his extraordinary endowment in this direction gave Lanier a unique position among English poets . I quote again from Professor Kent :* “ But if his sense of beauty made him a peer of our great poets , it was the heavenly gift of music that distinguished him from them . Milton , it is true , whom he most resembles in this respect , had a knowledge of music , but not the same passion for it . Milton 's music was more a recreation , an accompaniment of reverie ; Lanier 's was a fiery zeal ; a yearning love , a chosen and adequate form of expression of his soul 's deepest feeling . Combined with this passion for music was his technical knowledge of the art , and these combined formed at once the foundation and the framework of his poetry . He seems literally to have sung his poems ; they are essentially musical , tuneful , and melodious . Surcharged with music , he overflows in mellifluous numbers . Here , then , Lanier stands out differentiated in the choir of poets , and here we find that distinctive quality which is the very flavor of his writing . ”</p>
   <p>* P. 62 .</p>
   <p>While most of Lanier 's poems are in a serious strain , several disclose no mean sense of humor . I refer to his dialect poems , such as ` Jones 's Private Argyment ’ , ` Uncle Jim 's Baptist Revival Hymn ’ , and ` The Power of Prayer ’ , especially the last , written in conjunction with his brother , Mr. Clifford Lanier .</p>
   <p>There are passages in the poems no less pathetic than the poet 's life . In discussing his love of nature we have seen that he was a pantheist in the best sense of the term . So delicate was his sensibility that we do not wonder when we hear him declaring ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ And I am one with all the kinsmen things</l>
     <l n="2">That e'er my Father fathered ,"*</l>
   </lg>
   <p>a saying as felicitous as the Roman 's “ I am a man , and , therefore , nothing human is stranger to me . ” The tenderness of the ` Ballad of Trees and the Master ’ must touch all readers . Few passages are more pathetic , I think , than that , in ` June Dreams in January ’ , telling of the poet 's struggle for bread and fame , while “ his worshipful sweet wife sat still , afar , within the village whence she sent him forth , waiting all confident and proud and calm . ” And , if there occurs therein a plaintive tone , let us remember that it is the only time that he complained of his lot , and that here really he has more in mind his dearer self , his wife , and that calm succeeded to unrest just as it does in this passage :</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>It is now time to say a word about Lanier 's theory of art , especially the art of poetry . His views upon the formal side of poetry have already been noticed in the consideration of his ` Science of English Verse ’ , and hence receive no further comment here .</p>
   <p>That Lanier keenly appreciated the responsibility resting upon the artist , appears from ` Individuality ’ , where he tells us ,</p>
   <p>“ Awful is art because ‘ tis free ,"* 1 *</p>
   <p>and ,</p>
   <p>“ Each artist — gift of terror ! — owns his will . "* 2 *</p>
   <p>But he accepts the responsibility reverently and confidently :</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>But it is in his prose works that Lanier has treated the matter most at length , and to these I turn . In the first place , he insists that to be an artist one must know a great deal , a statement that would appear superfluous but for its frequent overlooking by would-be artists . Hence he is right in warning young writers : “ You need not dream of winning the attention of sober people with your poetry unless that poetry and your soul behind it are informed and saturated with at least the largest final conceptions of current science . "* That Lanier strove to follow this precept , we have abundant evidence in his life and in his works ; and I think that , if we remember his environments , we must wonder at the vastness , the accuracy , and the variety of his knowledge . As additionally illustrative of the last , I may add that Lanier invented some improvements for the flute , and made a discovery in the physics of music that the Professor of Physics in the University of Virginia thought considerable . **</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">* ` Gates ’ , p. 29 .</l>
     <l n="2">** See ` West ’ , p. 23 .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">In the second place , Lanier thinks that a poet 's knowledge of his art</l>
     <l n="4">should be scientific . It was this that led him to write</l>
     <l n="5">` The Science of English Verse ’ , the motto of which is ,</l>
     <l n="6">“ But the best conceptions cannot be , save where science and genius are . ”</l>
     <l n="7">In ` The English Novel ’ he declares that “ not a single verse</l>
     <l n="8">was ever written by instinct alone since the world began ,"*</l>
     <l n="9">and fortifies his statement by Ben Jonson 's tribute to Shakespeare , —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">“ For a good poet 's made as well as born ,</l>
     <l n="11">And such wert thou . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>But Lanier clearly saw that no formal laws and no amount of scientific knowledge could alone make a poet , as appears from the motto above quoted , from the closing chapter of ` The Science of English Verse ’ , which tells us that the educated love of beauty is the artist 's only law , and from this other motto , from Sir Philip Sidney : “ A Poet , no industrie can make , if his owne Genius bee not carried unto it . ”</p>
   <p>* ` The English Novel ’ , p. 33 .</p>
   <p>In the third place , Lanier holds that a moral intention on the part of an artist does not interfere with the naturalness or intrinsic beauty of his work ; that in art the controlling consideration is rather moral than artistic beauty ; but that moral beauty and artistic beauty , so far from being distinct or opposed , are convergent and mutually helpful . This thesis he upholds in the following eloquent and cogent passage : “ Permit me to recall to you in the first place that the requirement has been from time immemorial that wherever there is contest as between artistic and moral beauty , unless the moral side prevail , all is lost . Let any sculptor hew us out the most ravishing combination of tender curves and spheric softness that ever stood for woman ; yet if the lip have a certain fulness that hints of the flesh , if the brow be insincere , if in the minutest particular the physical beauty suggest a moral ugliness , that sculptor — unless he be portraying a moral ugliness for a moral purpose — may as well give over his marble for paving-stones . Time , whose judgments are inexorably moral , will not accept his work . For indeed we may say that he who has not yet perceived how artistic beauty and moral beauty are convergent lines which run back into a common ideal origin , and who therefore is not afire with moral beauty just as with artistic beauty — that he , in short , who has not come to that stage of quiet and eternal frenzy in which the beauty of holiness and the holiness of beauty mean one thing , burn as one fire , shine as one light , within him ; he is not yet the great artist . "* By copious quotations Lanier then shows that “ many fine and beautiful souls appear after a while to lose all sense of distinction between these terms , Beauty , Truth , Love , Wisdom , Goodness , and the like , ” and concludes thus : “ And if this be true , cannot one say with authority to the young artist , — whether working in stone , in color , in tones , or in character-forms of the novel : so far from dreading that your moral purpose will interfere with your beautiful creation , go forward in the clear conviction that unless you are suffused — soul and body , one might say — with that moral purpose which finds its largest expression in love — that is , the love of all things in their proper relation — unless you are suffused with this love , do not dare to meddle with beauty ; unless you are suffused with beauty , do not meddle with love ; unless you are suffused with truth , do not dare to meddle with goodness ; — in a word , unless you are suffused with beauty , truth , wisdom , goodness , AND love , abandon the hope that the ages will accept you as an artist .

     <l n="7">VI . Conclusion</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Milton has somewhere said that in order to be a great poet one must himself be a true poem , a dictum none the less trustworthy because of its inapplicability to its author along with several other great poets . Now of all English poets , I know of none that came nearer being a true poem than did Lanier . He was as spotless as “ the Lady of Christ 's ” , and infinitely more lovable . Indeed , he seems to me to have realized the ideal of his own knightly Horn , who hopes that some day men will be “ maids in purity ” . * I will not recall his gentle yet heroic life amid drawbacks almost unparalleled ; for it is even sadder than it is beautiful . It is my deliberate judgment that , while , as the poet says in his ` Life and Song ’ , no singer has ever wholly lived his minstrelsy , Lanier came so near it that we may fairly say , in the closing lines of the poem ,</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ His song was only living aloud ,</l>
     <l n="2">His work , a singing with his hand . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">And , for my part , I am as grateful for his noble private life</l>
     <l n="4">as for his distinguished public work .</l>
    </lg>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>And yet I will not close with this picture of the man ; for my purpose is rather to present the poet . Hampered though he was by fewness of years , by feebleness of body , by shortness of bread , and , most of all perhaps , by over-luxuriance of imagination , Lanier was yet , to my mind , indisputably a great poet . For in technique he was akin to Tennyson ;* in the love of beauty and in lyric sweetness , to Keats and Shelley ; in the love of nature , to Wordsworth ; and in spirituality , to Ruskin , the gist of whose teaching is that we are souls temporarily having bodies ; to Milton , “ God-gifted organ-voice of England ” ; and to Browning , “ subtlest assertor of the soul in song ” . To be sure , Lanier 's genius is not equal to that of any one of the poets mentioned , but I venture to believe that it is of the same order , and , therefore , deserving of lasting remembrance .</p>
   <p>* Mr. Thayer puts it stronger : “ As a master of melodious metre only Tennyson , and he not often , has equalled Lanier . ” Mr. F. F. Browne , Editor of ` The Dial ’ ( Chicago ) , compares the two poets in another aspect : “ ` The Symphony ’ of Lanier may recall some parts of ` Maud ’ ; but the younger poet 's treatment is as much his own as the elder 's is his own . The comparison of Lanier with Tennyson will , indeed , only deepen the impression of his originality , which is his most striking quality . It may be doubted if any English poet of our time , except Tennyson , has cast his work in an ampler mould , or wrought with more of freedom , or stamped his product with the impress of a stronger personality . His thought , his stand-point , his expression , his form , his treatment , are his alone ; and through them all he justifies his right to the title of poet . ”</p>

   <p>I can think of no more helpful comment on the subject of our poem than this sentence from Milton 's ` Apology for Smectymnuus ’ , already alluded to in the ` Introduction ’ ( p. liv [ Part VI ]): “ And long it was not after , when I was confirmed in this opinion , that he who would not be frustrate of his hope to write well hereafter in laudable things , ought himself to be a true poem ; that is , a composition and pattern of the best and honorablest things ; not presuming to sing high praises of heroic men or famous cities , unless he have in himself the experience and the practice of all that which is praiseworthy . ”</p>

   <p>The themes of this poem , the relative claims of corn and cotton upon the attention of the farmer and the disastrous results of speculation , are treated indirectly in ` Thar 's More in the Man Than Thar Is in the Land ’ , and directly and with consummate art in ` Corn ’ .</p>
   <p>1 . “ That air same Jones ” appears in ` Thar 's More ’ , etc ., written in 1869 , in which we are told :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ And he lived pretty much by gittin ’ of loans ,</l>
     <l n="2">And his mules was nuthin ’ but skin and bones ,</l>
     <l n="3">And his hogs was flat as his corn-bread pones ,</l>
     <l n="4">And he had ‘ bout a thousand acres o ’ land . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>He sells his farm to Brown at a dollar and fifty cents an acre and goes to Texas . Brown improves the farm , and , after five years , is sitting down to a big dinner when Jones is discovered standing out by the fence , without wagon or mules , “ fur he had left Texas afoot and cum to Georgy to see if he could n't git some employment . ” Brown invites Jones in to dinner , but cannot refrain from the inference-drawing that names the poem . — “ Which lived in Jones , ” “ which Jones is a county of red hills and stones ” (` Thar 's More ’ , etc . ) in central Georgia .</p>
   <p>13 . Readers of ` David Copperfield ’ will recall Micawber 's frequent use of ` I-O-U - ‘ s ’ .</p>

     <l n="202">Notes : Corn</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>As stated elsewhere (` Introduction ’ , p. xvii [ Part I ]) , ` Corn ’ was the first of Lanier 's poems to attract general attention ; for this reason as well as for its absolute merit the poem deserves careful study .</p>
   <p>In the first of his letters to the Hon . Logan E. Bleckley , Chief-justice of Georgia , dated October 9 , 1874 , Lanier tells us how he came to write ` Corn ': “ I enclose MS. of a poem in which I have endeavored to carry some very prosaic matters up to a loftier plane . I have been struck with alarm in seeing the numbers of deserted old homesteads and gullied hills in the older counties of Georgia : and , though they are dreadfully commonplace , I have thought they are surely mournful enough to be poetic . ”</p>
   <p>In the introductory note to ` Jones 's Private Argyment ’ I have incidentally stated the theme of ` Corn ’ . Instead of adding a more detailed statement of my own here , I give Judge Bleckley 's analysis of the poem , which occurs in his reply to the above-mentioned letter . After giving various minute criticism ( for Lanier had requested his unreserved judgment ) , Judge Bleckley continues : “ Now , for the general impression which your Ode has made upon me . It presents four pictures ; three of them landscapes and one a portrait . You paint the woods , a corn-field , and a worn-out hill . These are your landscapes . And your portrait is the likeness of an anxious , unthrifty cotton-planter who always spends his crop before he has made it , borrows on heavy interest to carry himself over from year to year , wears out his land , meets at last with utter ruin , and migrates to the West . Your second landscape is turned into a vegetable person , and you give its portrait with many touches of marvel and mystery in vegetable life . Your third landscape takes for an instant the form and tragic state of King Lear ; you thus make it seize on our sympathies as if it were a real person , and you then restore it to the inanimate , and contemplate its possible beneficence in the distant future . ”</p>
   <p>A comparison of the first draft of ` Corn ’ , as sent Judge Bleckley , with the final form shows that Lanier made many minute changes in the poem , especially in the earlier part . Still this earlier draft agrees substantially with the later , and was so fine in conception and execution as to call forth this commendation of Judge Bleckley , which , despite the shortcomings of ` Corn ’ , may with greater justice be applied to the poem in its present form : “ As an artist you seem to be Italian in the first two pictures , and Dutch or Flemish in the latter two . In your Italian vein you paint with the utmost delicacy and finish . The drawing is scrupulously correct and the color soft and harmonious . When you paint in Dutch or Flemish you are clear and strong , but sometimes hard . There is less idealization and more of the realistic element — your SOLIDS predominate over your fluids . ”</p>
   <p>As already stated , Lanier has two other poems that indirectly treat the theme of ` Corn ’ , namely , ` Thar 's More in the Man ’ and ` Jones 's Private Argyment ’ . Moreover , he has ` The Waving of the Corn ’ , which , though charming , is neither so elaborate nor artistic as ` Corn ’ .</p>
   <p>Among poems on corn by other writers may be mentioned the following :</p>
   <p>1 . Whittier 's ` The Corn-song ’ ( before 1872 ) , a poem of praise and thanksgiving at the end of ` The Huskers ’ , which tells of the gathering of the corn and of the “ corn-husking ” , known in the South as the “ corn-shucking ” .</p>
   <p>2 . Woolson 's ( Constance F .) ` Corn Fields ’ , a description of Ohio fields , in ` Harper 's Monthly ’ , 45 , 444 , Aug ., 1872 .</p>
   <p>3 . Thompson 's ( Maurice ) ` Dropping Corn ’ ( 1877 ) , a dainty love lyric , in ` Poems ’ ( Boston , 1892 ) , p. 78 .</p>
   <p>4 . Cromwell 's ( S. C .) ` Corn-shucking Song ’ , a dialect poem , in ` Harper ’ , 69 , 807 , Oct ., 1884 .</p>
   <p>5 . Coleman 's ( C. W .) ` Corn ’ , in ` The Atlantic Monthly ’ , 70 , 228 , Aug ., 1892 , which , since it consists of but four lines and is more like Lanier 's poem than are the others , may be quoted :</p>

   <p>125 . In her introductory note to ` Corn ’ Mrs. Lanier thus localizes the poem : “ His ` fieldward-faring eyes took harvest ’ ` among the stately corn-ranks , ’ in a portion of middle Georgia sixty miles to the north of Macon . It is a high tract of country from which one looks across the lower reaches to the distant Blue Ridge Mountains , whose wholesome breath , all unobstructed , here blends with the woods-odors of the beech , the hickory , and the muscadine : a part of a range recalled elsewhere by Mr. Lanier as ` that ample stretch of generous soil , where the Appalachian ruggednesses calm themselves into pleasant hills before dying quite away into the sea-board levels ’ — where ` a man can find such temperances of heaven and earth — enough of struggle with nature to draw out manhood , with enough of bounty to sanction the struggle — that a more exquisite co-adaptation of all blessed circumstances for man 's life need not be sought . ’ ”</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>For my appreciation of this tribute to the poet 's wife see ` Introduction ’ , p. xxxv [ Part III ] . Mr. Lanier 's estimate is given in a letter of March , 1874 , quoted in Mrs. Lanier 's introductory note : “ Of course , since I have written it to print I cannot make it such as I desire in artistic design : for the forms of to-day require a certain trim smugness and clean-shaven propriety in the face and dress of a poem , and I must win a hearing by conforming in some degree to these tyrannies , with a view to overturning them in the future . Written so , it is not nearly so beautiful as I would have it ; and I therefore have another still in my heart , which I will some day write for myself . ”</p>
   <p>Other tributes to his wife are : ` In Absence ’ , ` Acknowledgment ’ , ` Laus Mariae ’ , ` Special Pleading ’ , ` Evening Song ’ , ` Thou and I ’ , ` One in Two ’ , and ` Two in One ’ ; while she is referred to in ` The Hard Times in Elfland ’ and ` June Dreams in January ’ .</p>

     <l n="370">Notes : The Symphony</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The ` Introduction ’ ( pp . xxviii f ., xxxiii ff . [ Part III ] , xlvii [ Part IV ]) gives , besides the plan of ` The Symphony ’ , a detailed statement of its two themes , — the evils of the trade-spirit in the commercial and social world and the need in each of the love-spirit . These questions preyed on the poet 's mind and were to be treated at length in ` The Jacquerie ’ also , which he expected to make his great work , but which he was unable to complete . This he tells us in a noble passage to Judge Bleckley , in his letter of November 15 , 1874 . After deploring the lack of time for literary labor ( see quotation in ` Introduction ’ , p. xlvi [ Part IV ]) , he continues : “ I manage to get a little time tho ’ to work on what is to be my first ` magnum opus ’ , a long poem , founded on that strange uprising in the middle of the fourteenth century in France , called ` The Jacquerie ’ . It was the first time that the big hungers of ` the People ’ appear in our modern civilization ; and it is full of significance . The peasants learned from the merchant potentates of Flanders that a man who could not be a lord by birth , might be one by wealth ; and so Trade arose , and overthrew Chivalry . Trade has now had possession of the civilized world for four hundred years : it controls all things , it interprets the Bible , it guides our national and almost all our individual life with its maxims ; and its oppressions upon the moral existence of man have come to be ten thousand times more grievous than the worst tyrannies of the Feudal System ever were . Thus in the reversals of time , it is NOW the GENTLEMAN who must rise and overthrow Trade . That chivalry which every man has , in some degree , in his heart ; which does not depend upon birth , but which is a revelation from God of justice , of fair dealing , of scorn of mean advantages ; which contemns the selling of stock which one KNOWS is going to fall , to a man who BELIEVES it is going to rise , as much as it would contemn any other form of rascality or of injustice or of meanness ; — it is this which must in these latter days organize its insurrections and burn up every one of the cunning moral castles from which Trade sends out its forays upon the conscience of modern society . — This is about the plan which is to run through my book : though I conceal it under the form of a pure novel . ”</p>
   <p>Mr. F. F. Browne is doubtless right in saying that ` The Symphony ’ recalls parts of Tennyson 's ` Maud ’ , but the closest congeners of ` The Symphony ’ in English are , I think , Langland 's ` Piers The Plowman ’ in poetry and Ruskin 's ` Unto This Last ’ in prose . Widely as these two works differ from ` The Symphony ’ in form , they are one with it in purpose and in spirit . All three voice the outcry of the poor against the hardness of their lot and their longing for a larger life ; all three show that the only hope of relief lies in a broader and deeper love for humanity . Analogues to individual verses of ` The Symphony ’ are cited below .</p>

   <p>42-43 . See St. Matthew 4 : 4 .</p>
   <p>55-60 . It is precisely this evil that Ruskin has in mind , I take it , when he condemns the commercial text , “ Buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest , ” and when he declares that “ Competition is the law of death ” (` Unto This Last ’ , pp . 40 , 59 ) .</p>

   <p>294-298 . See ` Tiger-lilies ’ , p. 49 , and ` Betrayal ’ in Lanier 's complete ` Poems ’ , p. 213 . These lines of ` The Symphony ’ show clearly that Lanier did not believe that God made one law for man and another for woman , or that one very grievous sin should forever blight a woman 's life . What Christ himself thought is clear from St. Luke 7 : 36-50 , and St. John 8 : 1-11 .</p>

   <p>Notes : The Power of Prayer ; or , The First Steamboat up the Alabama</p>
   <p>As the title-page shows , ` The Power of Prayer ’ is the joint production of Sidney and Clifford Lanier . The latter gentleman informs me that once he read a newspaper scrap of about ten lines stating that a Negro on first seeing a steamboat coming down the river was greatly frightened . Mr. Lanier then wrote out in metrical form the plot of ` The Power of Prayer ’ , substantially as we now have it , and sent it to his brother Sidney , who polished it up and published it under their joint names . Mr. Clifford Lanier had not seen the piece mentioned in the next paragraph , nor had his brother ; but on being shown the piece , the former was of the opinion that his newspaper clipping must have been based on the work to which I turn , as it had already appeared and the incidents were so much alike .</p>
   <p>In the third chapter of ` The Gilded Age ’ ( Hartford , Conn ., 1873 ) by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner , there is a piece , ` Uncle Daniel 's Apparition and Prayer ’ , so similar to ` The Power of Prayer ’ that I quote it almost entire . Uncle Dan'l ( a Negro ) , his wife , his young mistress , and his two young masters were sitting on a log by the Mississippi River one moonlight night a-talking . “ Suddenly Uncle Dan'l exclaimed : ` Chil'en , dah 's sumfin a comin ’ ! '</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ All crowded close together and every heart beat faster .</l>
     <l n="2">Uncle Dan'l pointed down the river with his bony finger .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ A deep coughing sound troubled the stillness , way toward a wooded cape that jutted into the stream a mile distant . All in an instant a fierce eye of fire shot out from behind the cape and sent a long brilliant pathway quivering athwart the dusky water . The coughing grew louder and louder , the glaring eye grew larger and still larger , glared wilder and still wilder . A huge shape developed itself out of the gloom , and from its tall duplicate horns dense volumes of smoke , starred and spangled with sparks , poured out and went tumbling away into the farther darkness . Nearer and nearer the thing came , till its long sides began to glow with spots of light which mirrored themselves in the river and attended the monster like a torch-light procession .</p>
   <p>“ ` What is it ? Oh ! what is it , Uncle Dan'l ? ’</p>
   <p>“ With deep solemnity the answer came :</p>
   <p>“ ` It 's de Almighty ! Git down on yo ’ knees ! ’</p>
   <p>“ It was not necessary to say it twice . They were all kneeling in a moment . And then while the mysterious coughing rose stronger and stronger and the threatening glare reached farther and wider , the negro 's voice lifted up its supplications .</p>
   <p>“ ` O Lord , we 's ben mighty wicked , an ’ we knows dat we ‘ zerve to go to de bad place , but , good Lord , deah Lord , we ai n't ready yit , we ai n't ready — let dese po ’ chil'en hab one mo ’ chance , jes ’ one mo ’ chance . Take de ole niggah if you 's got to hab somebody . — Good Lord , good deah Lord , we do n't know whah you 's a gwine to , we do n't know who you 's got yo ’ eye on , but we knows by de way you 's a comin ’ , we know by de way you 's a tiltin ’ along in yo ’ charyot o ’ fiah dat some po ’ sinner 's a gwine to ketch it . But , good Lord , dese chil'en do n't ‘ blong heah , dey 's f 'm Obedstown whah dey do n't know nuffin , an ’ you knows , yo ’ own sef , dat dey ai n't ‘ sponsible . An ’ deah Lord , good Lord , it ai n't like yo ’ mercy , it ai n't like yo ’ pity , it ai n't like yo ’ long-sufferin ’ lovin ’ - kindness for to take dis kind o ’ ‘ vantage o ’ sich little chil'en as dese is when dey 's so many ornery grown folks chuck full o ’ cussedness dat wants roastin ’ down dah . O Lord , spah de little chil'en , do n't tar de little chil'en away f 'm dey frens , jes ’ let ‘ em off jes ’ dis once , and take it out'n de ole niggah . HEAH I IS , LORD , HEAH I IS ! De ole niggah 's ready , Lord , de ole —— ’</p>
   <p>“ The flaming and churning steamer was right abreast the party , and not twenty steps away . The awful thunder of a mud-valve suddenly burst forth , drowning the prayer , and as suddenly Uncle Dan'l snatched a child under each arm and scoured into the woods with the rest of the pack at his heels . And then , ashamed of himself , he halted in the deep darkness and shouted ( but rather feebly ):</p>
   <p>“ ` Heah I is , Lord , heah I is ! ’</p>
   <p>“ There was a moment of throbbing suspense , and then , to the surprise and comfort of the party , it was plain that the august presence had gone by , for its dreadful noises were receding . Uncle Dan'l headed a cautious reconnoissance in the direction of the log . Sure enough ` The Lord ’ was just turning a point a short distance up the river , and while they looked , the lights winked out and the coughing diminished by degrees and presently ceased altogether .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ ` H'wsh ! Well now dey 's some folks says dey ai n't no ‘ ficiency in prah .</l>
     <l n="2">Dis chile would like to know whah we 'd a ben now if it war n't fo ’ dat prah ?</l>
     <l n="3">Dat 's it . Dat 's it ! ’ ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>There follows a discussion as to whether or not the prayer caused the apparition to go by , of which of course Uncle Dan'l has no doubt . The apparition reappears and Uncle Dan'l betakes himself to prayer again , this time a long way off .</p>
   <p>I wrote the authors of ` The Gilded Age ’ and asked the source of ` Uncle Daniel 's Apparition and Prayer ’ . Mr. Clemens kindly replied that he is the author of the piece , and that it is pure fiction without either history or tradition back of it .</p>
   <p>A comparison of the two stories shows some differences . The scene in the one case is the Alabama River , in the other the Mississippi . Moreover , the PERSONNEL is different . The Negro man in Twain 's story is about forty , in Lanier 's he is old and has been blind for forty years . Another difference Mr. Sidney Lanier points out to his wife in his letter of October 1 , 1874 : “ Cliff 's and my ` Power of Prayer ’ will come out in the Scribner 's ; probably in the ` Etchings ’ at the end of the Magazine . I wrote thee what Dr. Holland said anent its resemblance to something of Mark Twain 's in plot . Day before yesterday I called and asked Dr. Holland what work of Mark Twain 's he referred to . ` Well , ’ said he , ` I know nothing about it myself : I read the poem to a friend , and he suggested that the plot was like something of Mark Twain 's . But yesterday I read him your note , and he then recollected that in Twain 's version it is God Almighty that is coming up the bend . In yours it is the Devil : — which certainly makes a little difference ! ’ and here he broke into a great laugh . ` Yes , ’ I rejoined , ` a difference toto coelo , ’ whereat he laughed again , and told me he had already ordered a check to be sent me for the poem . ”</p>
   <p>Mr. Clifford Lanier was born at Griffin , Ga ., April 24 , 1844 , entered business in Montgomery , Ala ., at fourteen , subsequently attended college for a year and a half , and in May , 1862 , joined his brother in the Confederate Army . His soldier life has been detailed in connection with that of the poet . In October , 1864 , Mr. Clifford Lanier was assigned as signal officer to the blockade-runner ` Talisman ’ , which , after two successful runs to the Bermuda Islands , was wrecked in December , 1864 . He escaped , however , and surrendered to the Federal authorities at the end of April , 1865 . He has been successively lawyer , hotel manager , and superintendent of schools in Montgomery , Ala. For several years past he has been a director of the Bank of Montgomery and other corporations . All the while , however , he has been deeply interested in literature and has written some graceful sketches and poems , among which may be mentioned the following : ` Thorn-fruit ’ ( 1867 ) , ` Love and Loyalty at War ’ ( 1893 ) , ` Biding Tryst ’ ( 1894 ) , prose ; ` Greatest of These is Love ’ , ` The American Philomel ’ , ` Keats and Fanny B —— ’ , ` The Spirit of Art ’ , ` Antinous to Hadrian ’ , ` Time ’ , ` Tireless ’ , ` Tramp ’ ( in Stedman and Hutchinson 's ` Library of American Literature ’ ) , ` Love and Life ’ , ` Edgar Allan Poe ’ , etc . As stated in the ` Introduction ’ , the Chautauquans of 1898 have named themselves “ The Laniers ” in honor of Messrs. Sidney and Clifford Lanier . The motto of the class is the first line of Mr. Clifford Lanier 's ` Transformation ’ (` Sunday-school Times ’ , Phila ., June 30 , 1894 ):</p>
   <p>“ The humblest life that lives may be divine . ”</p>
   <p>8 . The complete ` Poems ’ has ` the ’ before ` world ’ , but Mrs. Lanier thinks the poet must have used ` de ’ here as elsewhere .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Rose-morals in English literature probably begin with Sir John Mandeville in the fourteenth century . At any rate , in the eighteenth chapter of his ` Voyage and Travels ’ he professes to tell us the origin of red and white roses . A fair maid had been unjustly accused of wrong-doing and doomed to die by fire . “ And as the woode began to brenne ( burn ) about hir , she made hir prayer to our Lorde as she was not gyltie of that thing , that he would helpe hir that it might be knowne to all men . And whan ( when ) she had thus sayde , she entered the fyre and anone the fyre went out , and those braunches that were brenninge ( burning ) became red Roses and those braunches that were not kindled became white Rosiers ( rose bushes ) full of white roses , and those were the fyrst roses and rosyers that any man sawe , and so was the mayden saved through the grace of God . ”</p>
   <p>Thomas Carew has several rose-moralities , as ` The True Beauty ’ , beginning “ He that loves a rosy cheek , ” and his exquisite ` Red and White Roses ':</p>

     <l n="5">In the red , the flames still feeding</l>
     <l n="6">On my heart with fresh wounds bleeding .</l>
     <l n="7">The white will tell you how I languish ,</l>
     <l n="8">And the red express my anguish :</l>

     <l n="38">I think that the following note , prefixed by the authors to their poem ,</l>
     <l n="39">sufficiently explains what is to me one of their best humorous pieces :</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Not long ago a certain Georgia cotton-planter , driven to desperation by awaking each morning to find that the grass had quite outgrown the cotton overnight , and was likely to choke it , in defiance of his lazy freedmen 's hoes and ploughs , set the whole State in a laugh by exclaiming to a group of fellow-sufferers : ` It 's all stuff about Cincinnatus leaving the plough to go into politics “ for patriotism ” ; he was just a-runnin ’ from grass ! ’</p>
   <p>“ This state of things — when the delicate young rootlets of the cotton are struggling against the hardier multitudes of the grass-suckers — is universally described in plantation parlance by the phrase ` in the grass ’ ; and Uncle Jim appears to have found in it so much similarity to the condition of his own (` Baptis'’ ) church , overrun , as it was , by the cares of this world , that he has embodied it in the refrain of a revival hymn such as the colored improvisator of the South not infrequently constructs from his daily surroundings . He has drawn all the ideas of his stanzas from the early morning phenomena of those critical weeks when the loud plantation-horn is blown before daylight , in order to rouse all hands for a long day 's fight against the common enemy of cotton-planting mankind .</p>
   <p>“ In addition to these exegetical commentaries the Northern reader probably needs to be informed that the phrase ` peerten up ’ means substantially ` to spur up ’ , and is an active form of the adjective ` peert ’ ( probably a corruption of ` pert ’ ) , which is so common in the South , and which has much the signification of ` smart ’ in New England , as e. g ., a ` peert ’ horse , in antithesis to a ` sorry ’ — i. e ., poor , mean , lazy one . ”</p>

   <lg>
     <l n="1">In his ` Birds and Poets ’ ( Boston , 1877 ) , Mr. John Burroughs says</l>

     <l n="4">But since the appearance of his book many poems have been written</l>

   <p>Roughly speaking , the poems may be divided into two classes — first those that , as in the Indian legend cited below , make out the mocking-bird only or chiefly a thief and thing of evil , and second those that find him , though a borrower , original and great . The former view , fortunately upheld by few , is strikingly set forth in Granald 's ` The Mock-bird and the Sparrow ’ . After describing minutely the various songs of the mocking-bird and emphasizing that they all come from other birds , the author gives the dialogue between the mock-bird and the sparrow . The former taunted the latter and insisted on his singing ; and</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The sparrow cock 'd a knowing eye ,</l>
     <l n="2">And made him this most tart reply —</l>
     <l n="3">` You steal from all and call it wit ,</l>
     <l n="4">But I prefer my simple “ twit ” . ’ ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But the latter view is espoused by most of the writers mentioned , notably and nobly by Drake , the Haynes , the Laniers , Lee , Meek , and Thompson , the poet-laureate of the mocking-bird , whose poems should be read by every lover of nature and especially of the mocking-bird . As Thompson 's tributes are all too long for quotation , I give here Meek 's , in the hope that I may rescue it from the long oblivion of an out-of-print . My attention was called to it by my friend , Dr. C. H. Ross , to whom every reader will be indebted along with myself . It runs as follows :</p>

   <p>As is well known , the mocking-bird is often called the American nightingale . As to their relative merits as singers , here is the judgment of one that has heard both birds , Professor James A. Harrison (` The Critic ’ , New York , 2 . 284 , December 13 , 1884 ): “ Well , it is my honest opinion that philomel will not compare with the singer of the South in sweetness , versatility , passion , or lyrical beauty . The mocking-bird — better the echo-bird , with a voice compounded of all sweet sounds , as the blossom of the Chinese olive is compounded of all sweet scents — is a pure lyrist ; its throat is a lyre — Aeolian , capricious , many-stringed ; as its name suggests , it is a polyglot mime , a bird linguist , a feathered Mezzofanti singing all the bird languages ; yet over and above all this , with a something of its own that cannot be described . ” The mocking-bird speaks for himself in Thompson 's ` To an English Nightingale ':</p>

     <l n="1">“ What do you think of me ?</l>

     <l n="5">Oh no ! I caught my strains</l>

     <l n="12">Mine the soul of the brave and free ! ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>This self-appreciation is confirmed by the greatest authority on birds , Audubon : “ There is probably no bird in the world that possesses all the musical qualifications of this king of song , who has derived all from Nature 's self . Yes , reader , all ! ”</p>
   <p>It will be interesting and instructive to compare the tributes to the mocking-bird with Keats 's ` Ode to a Nightingale ’ , Shelley 's ` To a Skylark ’ , and Wordsworth 's ` To the Skylark ’ .</p>

The Chattahoochee is about five hundred miles long , and small steamboats can ascend it to Columbus , Ga. Hon . Henry R. Jackson , of Savannah , Ga ., late Minister to Mexico , has an interesting poem ` To the Chattahoochee River ’ , in his ` Tallulah and Other Poems ’ ( Savannah , Ga ., 1850 ) ; and Mr. M. V. Moore , in his poem , ` Southern Rivers ’ (` Harper ’ , 66 . 464 , February , 1883 ) , has a paragraph on the rivers of Georgia , in which he speaks of “ the sandy Chattahoochee ” .</p>
   <p>In the ` Introduction ’ ( pp . xxxi [ Part III ] , xliv , xlvii [ Part IV ]) I have spoken of this ` Song ’ as Lanier 's most finished nature poem , as the most musical of his productions . “ The music of a song easily eludes all analysis and may be dissipated by a critic 's breath , but let us try to catch the means by which the effect is in part produced . In five stanzas , of ten lines each , alliteration occurs in all save twelve lines . In eleven of these twelve lines internal rhyme occurs , sometimes joining the parts of a line , sometimes uniting successive lines . Syzygy is used for the same purpose . Of the letters occurring in the poem about one-fifth are liquids and about one-twelfth are sibilants . The effect of the whole is musical beyond description . It sings itself and yet nowhere sacrifices the thought ” ( Kent ) .</p>
   <p>Another way to test the beauty of ` The Song of the Chattahoochee ’ is to compare it with other kindred poems . There are many stream-songs in English , several of which are very pretty , but there is , I think , but one rival to our ` Song ’ , and that is Tennyson 's ` The Brook ’ . Even so careful a critic as Mr. Ward says that ` The Song of the Chattahoochee ’ “ strikes a higher key , and is scarcely less musical . ” It will be instructive , too , to compare Lanier 's poem with Southey 's ` The Cataract of Lodore ’ ( see ` Gates ’ , p. 25 ) , which exhibits considerable talent , if not inspiration ; with P. H. Hayne 's ` The Meadow Brook ’ , which is simple and sweet ; and with Wordsworth 's ` Brook ! whose society the Poet seeks ’ , which is grave and elevated . Professor Kent suggests as interesting analogues Poe 's ` Ulalume ’ and Buchanan Read 's ` Bay of Naples ’ ; and , if the student cares to extend his list , he should read the stream-songs by Bryant , Mary Ainge De Vere (` Century ’ , 21 . 283 , December , 1891 ) , Longfellow , Weir Mitchell (` Atlantic ’ , 65 . 629 , May , 1890 ) , Clinton Scollard (` Lippincott ’ , 50 . 226 , August , 1892 ) , etc ., etc .</p>
   <p>The Revenge of Hamish</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">It was three slim does and a ten-tined buck in the bracken lay ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></l>
     <l n="2">And all of a sudden the sinister smell of a man ,</l>
     <l n="3">Awaft on a wind-shift , wavered and ran</l>
     <l n="4">Down the hill-side and sifted along through the bracken and passed that way .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Then Nan got a-tremble at nostril ; she was the daintiest doe ;</l>
     <l n="6">In the print of her velvet flank on the velvet fern</l>
     <l n="7">She reared , and rounded her ears in turn .</l>
     <l n="8">Then the buck leapt up , and his head as a king 's to a crown did go</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Full high in the breeze , and he stood as if Death had the form of a deer ;</l>
     <l n="10">And the two slim does long lazily stretching arose ,</l>
     <l n="11">For their day-dream slowlier came to a close ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span></l>
     <l n="12">Till they woke and were still , breath-bound with waiting and wonder and fear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Then Alan the huntsman sprang over the hillock , the hounds shot by ,</l>
     <l n="14">The does and the ten-tined buck made a marvelous bound ,</l>
     <l n="15">The hounds swept after with never a sound ,</l>
     <l n="16">But Alan loud winded his horn in sign that the quarry was nigh .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">For at dawn of that day proud Maclean of Lochbuy to the hunt had waxed wild ,</l>
     <l n="18">And he cursed at old Alan till Alan fared off with the hounds</l>
     <l n="19">For to drive him the deer to the lower glen-grounds :</l>
     <l n="20">“ I will kill a red deer , ” quoth Maclean , “ in the sight of the wife</l>
     <l n="21">and the child . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="22">So gayly he paced with the wife and the child to his chosen stand ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span></l>
     <l n="23">But he hurried tall Hamish the henchman ahead : “ Go turn , ” —</l>
     <l n="24">Cried Maclean — “ if the deer seek to cross to the burn ,</l>
     <l n="25">Do thou turn them to me : nor fail , lest thy back be red as thy hand . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="26">Now hard-fortuned Hamish , half blown of his breath with the height</l>
     <l n="27">of the hill ,</l>
     <l n="28">Was white in the face when the ten-tined buck and the does</l>
     <l n="29">Drew leaping to burn-ward ; huskily rose</l>
     <l n="30">His shouts , and his nether lip twitched , and his legs were o'er-weak</l>
     <l n="31">for his will .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="32">So the deer darted lightly by Hamish and bounded away to the burn .</l>
     <l n="33">But Maclean never bating his watch tarried waiting below .</l>
     <l n="34">Still Hamish hung heavy with fear for to go<span type="note_anchor">[ 31 ]</span></l>
     <l n="35">All the space of an hour ; then he went , and his face was greenish and stern ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="36">And his eye sat back in the socket , and shrunken the eyeballs shone ,</l>
     <l n="37">As withdrawn from a vision of deeds it were shame to see .</l>
     <l n="38">“ Now , now , grim henchman , what is't with thee ? ”</l>
     <l n="39">Brake Maclean , and his wrath rose red as a beacon the wind hath upblown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="40">“ Three does and a ten-tined buck made out , ” spoke Hamish , full mild ,</l>
     <l n="41">“ And I ran for to turn , but my breath it was blown , and they passed ;</l>
     <l n="42">I was weak , for ye called ere I broke me my fast . ”</l>
     <l n="43">Cried Maclean : “ Now a ten-tined buck in the sight of the wife and the child</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="44">I had killed if the gluttonous kern had not wrought me</l>
     <l n="45">a snail 's own wrong ! ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 41 ]</span></l>
     <l n="46">Then he sounded , and down came kinsmen and clansmen all :</l>
     <l n="47">“ Ten blows , for ten tine , on his back let fall ,</l>
     <l n="48">And reckon no stroke if the blood follow not at the bite of thong ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="49">So Hamish made bare , and took him his strokes ; at the last he smiled .</l>
     <l n="50">“ Now I 'll to the burn , ” quoth Maclean , “ for it still may be ,</l>
     <l n="51">If a slimmer-paunched henchman will hurry with me ,</l>
     <l n="52">I shall kill me the ten-tined buck for a gift to the wife and the child ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="53">Then the clansmen departed , by this path and that ; and over the hill</l>
     <l n="54">Sped Maclean with an outward wrath for an inward shame ;</l>
     <l n="55">And that place of the lashing full quiet became ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 51 ]</span></l>
     <l n="56">And the wife and the child stood sad ; and bloody-backed Hamish sat still .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="57">But look ! red Hamish has risen ; quick about and about turns he .</l>
     <l n="58">“ There is none betwixt me and the crag-top ! ” he screams under breath .</l>
     <l n="59">Then , livid as Lazarus lately from death ,</l>
     <l n="60">He snatches the child from the mother , and clambers the crag toward the sea .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="61">Now the mother drops breath ; she is dumb , and her heart goes dead for a space ,</l>

     <l n="63">And that place of the lashing is live with men ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="65">Not a breath 's time for asking ; an eye-glance reveals</l>
     <l n="66">all the tale untold .<span type="note_anchor">[ 61 ]</span></l>
     <l n="67">They follow mad Hamish afar up the crag toward the sea ,</l>
     <l n="68">And the lady cries : “ Clansmen , run for a fee ! —</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="70">Fast Hamish back from the brink ! ” — and ever she flies up the steep ,</l>
     <l n="71">And the clansmen pant , and they sweat , and they jostle and strain .</l>
     <l n="72">But , mother , ‘ tis vain ; but , father , ‘ tis vain ;</l>
     <l n="73">Stern Hamish stands bold on the brink , and dangles the child o'er the deep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="74">Now a faintness falls on the men that run , and they all stand still .</l>
     <l n="75">And the wife prays Hamish as if he were God , on her knees ,</l>
     <l n="76">Crying : “ Hamish ! O Hamish ! but please , but please<span type="note_anchor">[ 71 ]</span></l>
     <l n="77">For to spare him ! ” and Hamish still dangles the child , with a wavering will .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="78">On a sudden he turns ; with a sea-hawk scream , and a gibe , and a song ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="82">Then Maclean he set hardly his tooth to his lip that his tooth was red ,</l>
     <l n="83">Breathed short for a space , said : “ Nay , but it never shall be !</l>
     <l n="84">Let me hurl off the damnable hound in the sea ! ”</l>
     <l n="85">But the wife : “ Can Hamish go fish us the child from the sea , if dead ?</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>For an appreciation of this fine poem see ` Introduction ’ , pp . xlv , xlvii [ Part IV ] , Mr. J. R. Tait , a friend with whom Mr. Lanier discussed ` The Revenge of Hamish ’ , kindly writes me that the author took the plot from William Black 's novel , ` Macleod of Dare ’ . In chapter iii . Macleod , of Castle Dare , Mull , tells the story to his London entertainer ; but , as the story of the novel is identical with that of the poem , it need not be given here . The novel , I should add , gives the name of the chieftain only , though , as it has a Hamish in another connection , it doubtless gave Lanier this name for the henchman . Previous to the reception of Mr. Tait 's letter I supposed that Lanier had borrowed his plot from a poem by Charles Mackay , ` Maclaine 's Child , A Legend of Lochbuy , Mull ’ , which in plot is identical with Lanier 's poem , except that the former begins with the speech of the flogged henchman , here named Evan , and ends by telling us that the bodies were found and that of Evan was hanged on a gallows-tree . The poem is too long for quotation , but may be found in any edition of Mackay or in Garrett 's ` One Hundred Choice Selections : Number Nine ’ ( Phila ., 1887 ) .</p>
   <p>17 . The Macleans , for centuries one of the most powerful of Scottish clans , have since the fourteenth century lived in Mull , one of the largest of the Hebrides Islands . The two leading branches of the clan were the Macleans of Dowart and the Macleans of Lochbuy , both taking their names from the seats of their castles . The Lochbuy family now spells its name MacLAINE . For a detailed history of the clan see Keltie 's ` History of the Scottish Highlands , Highland Clans ’ , etc . ( London , 1885 ) . Interesting books about Mull and the Hebrides are : Johnson 's ` A Journey to the Hebrides ’ and Robert Buchanan 's ` The Hebrid Isles ’ ( London , 1883 ) . Instructive , too , is Cummin 's ` Around Mull ’ (` The Atlantic Monthly ’ , 16 . 11-19 , 167-176 , July , August , 1865 ) .</p>

     <l n="109">Notes : The Marshes of Glynn</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Although Dr. Callaway noted in his preface the importance of this poem , he did not include it for lack of space . This would seem to indicate that when he published these “ Selected Poems ” in 1895 , “ The Marshes of Glynn ” had not yet achieved its later prominence as the greatest of Sidney Lanier 's poems — as now seems to be the opinion . The setting of the poem is the salt marshes surrounding the coastal city of Brunswick , Georgia , which is in Glynn County — an area well deserving of the fame Lanier has given it — and it was intended as one installment in a series of “ Hymns of the Marshes ” , of which four poems were completed .</p>
   <p>The text is taken from the 1916 edition of “ Poems of Sidney Lanier ” .</p>
   <p>William Hayes Ward wrote of this poem : “ How naturally his large faith in God finds expression in his ` Marshes of Glynn ’ . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Edwin Mims , in his biography of Sidney Lanier , concludes by quoting this poem .</l>
     <l n="2">He writes :</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ His best poems move to the cadence of a tune . . . . Sometimes , as in the ` Marshes of Glynn ’ and in the best parts of ` Sunrise ’ , there is a cosmic rhythm that is like unto the rhythmic beating of the heart of God , of which Poe and Lanier have written eloquently . ”</p>
   <p>And later continues :</p>
   <p>“ Indeed , if one had to rely upon one poem to keep alive the fame of Lanier , he could single out ` The Marshes of Glynn ’ with assurance that there is something so individual and original about it , and that , at the same time , there is such a roll and range of verse in it , that it will surely live not only in American poetry but in English . Here the imagination has taken the place of fancy , the effort to do great things ends in victory , and the melody of the poem corresponds to the exalted thought . It has all the strong points of ` Sunrise ’ , with but few of its limitations . There is something of Whitman 's virile imagination and Emerson 's high spirituality combined with the haunting melody of Poe 's best work . Written in 1878 , when Lanier was in the full exercise of all his powers , it is the best expression of his genius and one of the few great American poems .</p>
   <p>“ The background of the poem — as of ` Sunrise ’ — is the forest , the coast and the marshes near Brunswick , Georgia . Early in life Lanier had been thrilled by this wonderful natural scenery , and later visits had the more powerfully impressed his imagination . He is the poet of the marshes as surely as Bryant is of the forests , or Wordsworth of the mountains .</p>
   <p>“ The poet represents himself as having spent the day in the forest and coming at sunset into full view of the length and the breadth and the sweep of the marshes . The glooms of the live-oaks and the emerald twilights of the ` dim sweet woods , of the dear dark woods , ’ have been as a refuge from the riotous noon-day sun . More than that , in the wildwood privacies and closets of lone desire he has known the passionate pleasure of prayer and the joy of elevated thought . His spirit is grown to a lordly great compass within , — he is ready for what Wordsworth calls a ` god-like hour ’ . ”</p>
   <p>Mr. Callaway also treats the poem in Part III of the ` Introduction ’ .</p>

   <p>As an introduction to this poem I quote a sentence from Dr. Gates 's excellent essay : “ As we look at the circumstances of his life , let us carry with us the strains of this poem , which interprets the use of crosses , interferences , and attempted thwartings of one 's purpose ; for the ethical value of Lanier 's life and writings can be fully understood only by remembering how much he overcame and how heroically he persisted in manly work in his chosen art through years of such broken health as would have driven most men to the inert , self-indulgent life of an invalid . The superb power of will which he displayed is a lesson as valuable as the noble poems which it illustrates and enforces . ”</p>

   <p>At the first reading , no doubt , this song appears indistinct , though poetical . On a second reading , however , with Shakespeare 's ` Tempest ’ fresh in mind , it seems , as it is , highly artistic ; and we wonder at the happy use made of the Shakespearean characters : the gracious , forgiving Prospero , the rightful Duke of Milan ; Antonio , his usurping brother , forgiven notwithstanding ; Caliban , the savage , deformed , fish-like slave ; and Ariel , the ministering spirit of the air .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In the ` Introduction ’ ( p. xxxi ff . [ Part III ]) I have tried to show the intensity and the breadth of Lanier 's love of nature in general . President Gates gives a separate section to Lanier 's love of trees and plant-life ; and , after quoting some lines on the soothing and inspiring companionship of trees , thus speaks of our Ballad : “ This ministration of trees to a mind and heart ` forspent with shame and grief ’ finds its culmination in the pathetic lines upon that olive-garden near Jerusalem , which to those of us who have sat within its shade must always seem the most sacred spot on earth . The almost mystic exaltation of the power of poetic sympathy which inspired these intense lines , ` Into the Woods my Master went ’ , may impair their religious effect for many devout souls . But to many others this short poem will express most wonderfully that essential human-heartedness in the Son of Man , our Divine Saviour , which made Him one with us in His need of the quiet , sympathetic ministrations of nature — perhaps the heart of the reason why this olive-grove was ` the place where He was wont to go ’ for prayer . ” See St. Luke 22 : 39 .</p>

     <l n="195">Notes : Sunrise</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In the words of Mrs. Lanier , “ ` Sunrise ’ , Mr. Lanier 's latest completed poem , was written while his sun of life seemed fairly at the setting , and the hand which first pencilled its lines had not strength to carry nourishment to the lips . ” See ` Introduction ’ , p. xviii [ Part I ] . Lanier has two other poems on the same theme , both short : ` A Sunrise Song ’ and ` Between Dawn and Sunrise ’ ( entered under ` Marsh Hymns ’ ) .</p>
   <p>As already pointed out (` Introduction ’ , pp . xxxi [ Part III ] , xlvii [ Part IV ]) , ` Sunrise ’ shows in a powerful way the delicacy and the comprehensiveness of Lanier 's love for nature . True , as I have elsewhere stated (` Introduction ’ , p. xlvi [ Part IV ]) , the poem has some serious limitations , more I think than has ` The Marshes of Glynn ’ ; but , despite its shortcomings , ` Sunrise ’ is from an absolute stand-point a great poem ; while , if we consider the circumstances under which it was produced , it is , in the words of Professor Kent , “ a world-marvel ” .</p>
   <p>Aside from the numerous unapproachable snatches in Shakespeare ,* I know of nothing on the subject in English literature comparable to ` Sunrise ’ . Mr. W. W. Story 's ` Sunrise ’ is perhaps the closest parallel , and yet it is far inferior to Lanier 's , as every reader of the two will admit . If one wishes to make further comparisons , he may find sunrise poems in the following authors : Blake , Cowper , Emerson , Hood , Keats , Longfellow , Southey , Thompson , Willis , etc . I may add that an interesting , though superficial article on ` The Poetry of Sunrise and Sunset ’ may be found in ` Chambers 's Edinburgh Journal ’ , 22 , 234 , October 7 , 1854 .</p>
   <p>* Among others I may cite the following passages :</p>
   <p>“ Hark ! hark ! the lark at heaven 's gate sings , ”</p>
   <p>in ` Cymbeline ’ , 2 , 3 ;</p>

   <p>42 . I had made the comparison between Lanier and St. Francis before reading Dr. Gates 's essay on Lanier , and was delighted to find my judgment confirmed by so competent a critic . Dr. Gates is quite emphatic : “ Since St. Francis , no soul has seemed so heavily overcharged with this feeling of brotherhood for all created things . ” ` The Canticle of the Sun ’ , otherwise known as ` The Song of the Creatures ’ , may be found in metrical form in Mrs. Oliphant 's life of St. Francis ( New York , 1870 ) and in prose in Sabatier 's ( Scribners , New York , 1894 ) .</p>
