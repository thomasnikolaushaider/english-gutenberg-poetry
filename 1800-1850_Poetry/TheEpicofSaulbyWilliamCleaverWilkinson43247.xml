    <p>BY THE SAME AUTHOR THE EPIC OF PAUL A SEQUEL TO “ THE EPIC OF SAUL ” The action of THE EPIC OF PAUL begins with that conspiracy formed at Jerusalem against the life of the apostle , which in the sequel led to a prolonged suspension of his free missionary career . It embraces the incidents of his removal from Jerusalem to Caesarea , of his imprisonment at the latter place , of his journey to Rome for trial before Caesar , and of his final martyrdom . The design of the poem as a whole is to present through conduct on Paul 's part and through speech from him , a living portrait of the man that he was , together with a reflex of his most central and most characteristic teaching . Its descriptions are vivid , and it brings the reader 's mind into close touch with the great spirit of Paul . It is a poem in which dignity , beauty , and power are commingled with a rare charm . “ Paul , the new man , retrieved from perished Saul , Unequaled good and fair , from such unfair , Such evil , orient miracle unguessed !— Both what himself he was and what he taught — This marvel in meet words to fashion forth And make it live an image to the mind Forever , blooming in celestial youth . ” — From the Proem . AN APPRECIATIVE CRITICISM . “ Noble as was Dr. Wilkinson 's ‘ Epic of Saul , ’ his ‘ Epic of Paul ’ is even nobler . The kingliness of its range ; the majesty of its principal figure ; the fascination of its subordinate figures ; the subtlety of its characterizations ; the pathos of its interviews ; the intricate consistency of its plot ; the conscientiousness of its exegesis and allusions ; the splendor of its imaginations ; the nobility of its ethics ; the stateliness of its rhythm ; the grandeur of its evolution — these are some of the characteristics which make ‘ The Epic of Paul ’ another necessary volume in the library of every clergyman , philosopher , and litterateur . ” — REV . GEORGE DANA BOARDMAN , D. D . 8vo , Cloth , Gilt top , 722 pp . Price , $ 2. 00 , post-free . Both books together , $ 3. 00 . FUNK &amp; WAGNALLS COMPANY , Publishers , New York</p>

    <docTitle><titlePart>THE EPIC OF SAUL . Saul of Tarsus , brought up at Jerusalem a pupil of Gamaliel , the most celebrated Rabbi of his time , from setting out as eager but pacific controversialist in public dispute against the preachers of the Gospel , changes into a virulent , bloody persecutor of Christians , and ends by abruptly becoming himself a Christian and a teacher of Christianity . THE EPIC OF SAUL tells the story of this . PROEM . Saul saw the prophet face of Stephen shine As it had been an angel 's , but his heart To the august theophany was blind — Blinded by hatred of the fervent saint , And hatred of the Lord who in him shone . What blindfold hatred such could work of ill In nature meant for utter nobleness , Then , how the hatred could to love be turned , The proud wrong will to lowly right be brought , And Paul the “ servant ” spring from rebel Saul — This , ye who love in man the good and fair , And joy to hail retrieved the good and fair From the unfair and evil , hearken all And speed me with your wishes , while I sing . BOOK I. SAUL AND GAMALIEL . Saul visits Gamaliel to submit a forming purpose conceived by him of entering into public dispute with the Christian preachers . Gamaliel disapproves ; informing Saul that the Jewish rulers are about to apply against those preachers the penalties of the law . These men accordingly arrested and arraigned , the Sanhedrim hold a council on their case , at which Caiaphas advises accusing them to the Romans as seditious ; Mattathias urges stoning them out of hand ; Shimei recommends pursuing against them a policy of guile .

    <head>SAUL AND GAMALIEL .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Gamaliel sat at evening on his roof</l>
     <l n="2">And deeply mused the meaning of the law .</l>
     <l n="3">The holy city round about him lay</l>
     <l n="4">Magnificent , encircled with her hills .</l>
     <l n="5">Beyond the torrent Kedron , sunken deep</l>
     <l n="6">Within his winding valley , Olivet</l>
     <l n="7">Leaned long his shaded ridge against the east ,</l>
     <l n="8">Distinct in every olive to the sun .</l>
     <l n="9">Nearer , amid the city , chief to see ,</l>
     <l n="10">The glory of the temple of the Lord !</l>
     <l n="11">The seat was noble for a noble pile :</l>
     <l n="12">The summit of Moriah , levelled large ,</l>
     <l n="13">Spread larger yet , outbuilt on masonry</l>
     <l n="14">Cyclopean , or more huge , pillar and arch</l>
     <l n="15">Fast-founded like the basis of a world .</l>
     <l n="16">A world of architecture rested there —</l>
     <l n="17">Temple , and court , and long-drawn colonnade</l>
     <l n="18">On terrace above terrace ranged around ,</l>
     <l n="19">Cloister , and porch , and pendent gallery ,</l>
     <l n="20">Height , depth , length , space , and splendor , without end ,</l>
     <l n="21">Glittering its stones of lustre purest white ,</l>
     <l n="22">And stately portals rich with gems and gold :</l>
     <l n="23">The setting sun now smote it that it blazed .</l>
     <l n="24">The sight was torment to Gamaliel 's pride ,</l>
     <l n="25">Torment with pleasure mixed , but torment more ,</l>
     <l n="26">As there he sat upon his roof alone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="27">Tall , and erect in port , unbent his form</l>
     <l n="28">With all that weight of venerable years ,</l>
     <l n="29">His head with almond-blossom glory-crowned ,</l>
     <l n="30">And bosom overstreamed with silver beard ,</l>
     <l n="31">Gamaliel stood before his countrymen</l>
     <l n="32">Their stay , their solace , and their ornament ,</l>
     <l n="33">One upright pillar in a fallen state .</l>
     <l n="34">Fallen , for Rome had pushed her foaming wave</l>
     <l n="35">Of conquest far into the East , and laid</l>
     <l n="36">Judaea under deluge , quiet now ,</l>
     <l n="37">But deep , of domination absolute —</l>
     <l n="38">A weight as of the sea upon her breast .</l>
     <l n="39">Jerusalem was glorious to behold ,</l>
     <l n="40">Girdled with guardian mountains round about ,</l>
     <l n="41">And sunlit with her temple in the midst .</l>
     <l n="42">Alas , but more her glory , more her shame !</l>
     <l n="43">For all her glory was the Roman 's now ,</l>
     <l n="44">The queen a vassal at a tyrant 's feet ,</l>
     <l n="45">She Caesar serving who should serve but God .</l>
     <l n="46">And , worse disgrace than heathen servitude ,</l>
     <l n="47">There recreant Jews were found , and more and more ,</l>
     <l n="48">Who their hearts sold to their captivity ,</l>
     <l n="49">And abjectly gave up the ancient hope</l>
     <l n="50">And promise , dawning-star of prophecy ,</l>
     <l n="51">That yet to captive Israel should arise</l>
     <l n="52">Messiah , King of kings and Lord of lords ,</l>
     <l n="53">To break the yoke from off His people 's neck</l>
     <l n="54">And gift them with the empire of the earth —</l>
     <l n="55">This crown of Israel 's hope gave up , to choose ,</l>
     <l n="56">Instead , for captain and deliverer , one</l>
     <l n="57">Base-born , from Galilee , consorting friend</l>
     <l n="58">With publicans and sinners , hung at last</l>
     <l n="59">Convicted malefactor on the cross !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="60">Such thoughts and tortures exercised the mind</l>
     <l n="61">Of grave Gamaliel on his roof that eve .</l>
     <l n="62">He felt the burden of his name and fame</l>
     <l n="63">Weigh heavy , his renown of sanctity ,</l>
     <l n="64">With wisdom , rife so wide , and holy zeal .</l>
     <l n="65">His head declined upon his bosom , there</l>
     <l n="66">Amid the evening cool unheeded , he ,</l>
     <l n="67">Gray reverend teacher of the law , sat mute ,</l>
     <l n="68">Rapt over the writ parchment on his knees ,</l>
     <l n="69">And read , or thought , or thought and read , and prayed .</l>
     <l n="70">The veil was on the old man 's heart ; he saw</l>
     <l n="71">Unseeing , for the sense from him was sealed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="72">In words like these his prayer and plaint he poured :</l>
     <l n="73">“ Hath God forgotten to be gracious ? Will</l>
     <l n="74">Jehovah cast us off forevermore ?</l>
     <l n="75">We groan , O Lord , Thy people groan , beneath</l>
     <l n="76">The yoke of the oppressor . It is time ,</l>
     <l n="77">Lo , bow Thy heavens and come avenging down !</l>
     <l n="78">Appear Thou for Thy people ! Visit us !</l>
     <l n="79">Not only the uncircumcised are come ,</l>
     <l n="80">And heathen , into Thine inheritance ,</l>
     <l n="81">But of Thy chosen seed are risen up</l>
     <l n="82">False children unto Abraham , to vex</l>
     <l n="83">Our nation 's peace and shame us to our foes .</l>
     <l n="84">The son of Joseph suffered his desert ,</l>
     <l n="85">Accursed , on the tree , pretender vile ,</l>
     <l n="86">Who out of Nazareth came forth to claim</l>
     <l n="87">Messiahship , the gift of David 's line ,</l>
     <l n="88">And trailed a glorious banner in the dust ,</l>
     <l n="89">The banner of the hope of Israel .</l>
     <l n="90">That day , too long expected , yet shall dawn</l>
     <l n="91">And true Messiah , girded on His thigh</l>
     <l n="92">His sword athirst for alien blood , shall ride</l>
     <l n="93">Conquering and to conquer over all</l>
     <l n="94">The necks of these His enemies and ours .</l>
     <l n="95">How long , Lord God of Sabaoth , how long ?</l>
     <l n="96">For now that hated false Messiah 's name</l>
     <l n="97">Is preached , the dead for re-arisen to life ,</l>
     <l n="98">The crucified for glorified , to men ,</l>
     <l n="99">And ICHABOD is written everywhere</l>
     <l n="100">On all that was the boast of Israel .</l>
     <l n="101">O Thou that overthrewest the harrying horde</l>
     <l n="102">Of Pharaoh whelmed beneath the entombing sea ,</l>
     <l n="103">Rise , overwhelm Thine enemies , restore</l>
     <l n="104">The glory and the kingdom to Thine own ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="105">Gamaliel prayed , and knew not that his prayer</l>
     <l n="106">Found voice and smote at least an earthly ear .</l>
     <l n="107">“ Amen ! ” Gamaliel started as he heard</l>
     <l n="108">The voice of Saul responding fervently .</l>
     <l n="109">Saul had been pupil to Gamaliel ,</l>
     <l n="110">Loyal and loving , and he now was friend</l>
     <l n="111">Familiar , whom , as guest , unbidden oft</l>
     <l n="112">And unannounced , that famous Pharisee</l>
     <l n="113">Welcomed to share his most seclusive hours .</l>
     <l n="114">“ My son ! ” “ Rabboni ! ” mutually they said .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="115">The younger to the elder now had come ,</l>
     <l n="116">A thought to purpose quickening in his breast .</l>
     <l n="117">He too was Hebrew patriot , and he yearned</l>
     <l n="118">With anguish like his master 's , yet at once</l>
     <l n="119">Sharper than his , and more accessible</l>
     <l n="120">To hope , as well his livelier youth became</l>
     <l n="121">And native blood more nimble in his veins —</l>
     <l n="122">Saul also , with Gamaliel , yearned and burned ,</l>
     <l n="123">Beholding prone his country in the dust ,</l>
     <l n="124">Under the grinding heel of Roman power —</l>
     <l n="125">And Messianic glory turned to shame !</l>
     <l n="126">Saul 's first wish was to bring his brethren back</l>
     <l n="127">Stung to their pristine , proud , prophetic hope</l>
     <l n="128">Of a Messiah born to regal robes ,</l>
     <l n="129">Swaying a sceptre , seated on a throne ,</l>
     <l n="130">Crowned with a crown of myriad diadems ,</l>
     <l n="131">Symbol of lordship that should myriad tribes</l>
     <l n="132">Mass in one mighty empire of mankind .</l>
     <l n="133">He felt the soul of eloquence astir</l>
     <l n="134">Within him , and he longed to be at war ,</l>
     <l n="135">In words that flamed like lightning and that smote</l>
     <l n="136">Like thunder-stones , against those grovelling men</l>
     <l n="137">Who Israel taught to grovel at the feet</l>
     <l n="138">Of Galilaean Jesus crucified ,</l>
     <l n="139">Accepted for the Christ , forsooth , of God !</l>
     <l n="140">Such wish , becoming purpose , Saul has brought</l>
     <l n="141">This evening to Gamaliel , with high hope ,</l>
     <l n="142">Hope high , but vain , to disappointment doomed ,</l>
     <l n="143">Of grateful gratulant words to hearten him ,</l>
     <l n="144">Approving and applauding his desire ,</l>
     <l n="145">Won from the wisest in Jerusalem .</l>

     <l n="164">Her trodden dust is dear to me . Not I ,</l>
     <l n="165">As do my brethren on her bosom born ,</l>
     <l n="166">Equably love her with composed and calm</l>

     <l n="174">My being for my kinsmen in the flesh .</l>
     <l n="175">Would God I might in very deed pour out</l>
     <l n="176">This blood , no vain oblation , to redeem</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="195">Against the vernal aspiration warm</l>

     <l n="200">Like an ice-Alp that freezes on its cheek</l>
     <l n="201">A breath of spring soft blowing from the south .</l>
     <l n="202">With viscid slow demur the old man spoke ,</l>
     <l n="203">And downcast heavily shook his hoary head :</l>
     <l n="204">“ To dare is cheap and common with our race ,</l>
     <l n="205">We are few dastards ; did not Judas dare ?</l>

     <l n="207">Wisdom with daring , fortitude to wait ,</l>

   <p>BOOK II .</p>
   <p>SAUL AND THE SANHEDRIM .</p>
   <p>The Sanhedrim still in session on the apostles ’ case , Saul speaks ; first scornfully repudiating for himself Shimei 's proposal of guile , and then impressively announcing his own purpose , now fully mature , to controvert the Christian preachers in open argument before the people . After a pause following Saul 's speech , Gamaliel speaks in favor of letting the prisoners go free . Other councillors express their sentiments . A scourging of the utmost severity being proposed , Nicodemus , with bated breath , deprecates first a cruel infliction , and then any infliction at all . Release after scourging is finally resolved upon .</p>

   <p>Stephen , following Saul , turns the tide of feeling overwhelmingly in the opposite direction . Saul , however , but he almost alone — for even his sister Rachel has been converted — stands out defiant against the manifest power of God . Shimei appears as an auditor watching with sinister motive the course of the controversy .</p>

     <l n="1">The tumult grew a tempest when Saul ceased :</l>
     <l n="2">No single voice of mortal man might hope ,</l>
     <l n="3">Though clear like clarion and like trumpet loud ,</l>
     <l n="4">To live in that possessed demoniac sea</l>
     <l n="5">Of vast vociferation whelming all ,</l>
     <l n="6">Or ride the surges of the wild uproar .</l>
     <l n="7">What ailed thee , O thou sea , that thy mad mind</l>
     <l n="8">So suddenly was soothed ? Did ‘ Peace , be still ! ’</l>
     <l n="9">Dropping , an unction from the Holy One ,</l>
     <l n="10">Softly as erst on stormy Galilee ,</l>
     <l n="11">Wide overspread the summits of the waves</l>
     <l n="12">And sway their swelling down to glassy calm ?</l>
     <l n="13">Stephen stood forth to speak , and all was still .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="14">Before he spoke , already Rachel felt</l>
     <l n="15">A different power of silence there , and sense ,</l>
     <l n="16">Within , other than sympathetic awe ;</l>
     <l n="17">This felt she , though she knew it not , nor dreamed</l>
     <l n="18">It was the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven !</l>

     <l n="21">From God with power — “ God 's thoughts are not our thoughts ,</l>
     <l n="22">Neither our ways His ways ; for as the heavens</l>
     <l n="23">Are than the earth more high , so than our ways</l>
     <l n="24">More high are His , and His thoughts than our thoughts .</l>
     <l n="25">Our valued wisdom folly is to God</l>
     <l n="26">Full oft ; then most , when folly seems to us</l>
     <l n="27">God 's wisdom . Have ye yet to learn that God</l>
     <l n="28">Rejoices to confound the vain conceit</l>
     <l n="29">Of man ? The Scriptures , then , search ye with eyes</l>
     <l n="30">Blinded so thick ? It is Isaiah 's word :</l>
     <l n="31">‘ Jehovah , yea , hath poured upon you all</l>
     <l n="32">The spirit of deep sleep , and hath your eyes ,</l>
     <l n="33">Those prophets of the soul that might be , closed ,</l>
     <l n="34">Also your heads , meant to be seers , hath veiled ;</l>
     <l n="35">And vision all is now to you become</l>
     <l n="36">Even as the words of a shut book and sealed .</l>
     <l n="37">Therefore Jehovah saith , For that this people</l>
     <l n="38">Draw nigh to Me in worship with their mouth ,</l>
     <l n="39">But have their heart removed from Me afar ,</l>
     <l n="40">While all their fear of Me is empty form</l>
     <l n="41">Enjoined of men , and idly learned by rote —</l>
     <l n="42">Behold , a thing of wonder will I do</l>
     <l n="43">Among this people , wonder passing thought ,</l>
     <l n="44">And perish shall the wisdom of their wise</l>
     <l n="45">And prudence of their prudent come to nought ! ’</l>

   <p>BOOK V .</p>
   <p>SAUL AND SHIMEI .</p>
   <p>Saul , sullen , gloomy , and chagrined , over his discomfiture recently experienced , is visited , in his self-imposed seclusion at home , by Shimei , who , always by nature antipathetic to Saul , hates him virulently now for the affront from him received publicly in the late council . Shimei exasperates Saul with sneering , pretended sympathy for him over his defeat at Stephen 's hands ; at the same time disclosing the plot he has himself concocted , involving subornation of perjury , with alleged connivance on the part of the Sanhedrim in general , for the stoning of Stephen . Shimei gone , Saul , in the open court of his dwelling , sits solitary , brooding in the depths of dejection over the fallen state of his fortunes .</p>

     <l n="1">Saul thus forlorn , a voice smote on his ear ,</l>
     <l n="2">Voice other than of Shimei , clear and sweet ;</l>
     <l n="3">The very sound was balsam to his pain .</l>
     <l n="4">Rachel 's the voice was , who , with deep distaste ,</l>
     <l n="5">As jealous for her brother , had perceived</l>
     <l n="6">The entering in to Saul of his late guest</l>
     <l n="7">Ill-favored , and through all his stay had still ,</l>
     <l n="8">Impatiently awaiting , wished him sped .</l>

     <l n="10">From out her curtained chamber glimpsing gay</l>
     <l n="11">Behind her , through the hangings , as she passed ,</l>
     <l n="12">With color — stuff of scarlet , linen fine</l>
     <l n="13">Embroidered , weft of purple tapestry ,</l>
     <l n="14">Her handiwork — and sending after her</l>
     <l n="15">Sweet scent of herb and flower , her husbandry —</l>
     <l n="16">Forth issued , and across the inner court</l>
     <l n="17">Open to heaven — small close of paradise ,</l>
     <l n="18">A tall palm by a fountain , bloomy shrubs ,</l>
     <l n="19">And vines that clad with green the enclosing walls —</l>

     <l n="21">A tent-cloth canopy outspread , his own</l>
     <l n="22">Tent-making skill — the high noon of the sun</l>
     <l n="23">To fend , if place perchance one then might wish</l>
     <l n="24">In which free air to breathe safe from the heat —</l>
     <l n="25">There sat relapsed , deep brooding gloomy thoughts ,</l>
     <l n="26">When now his sister pausing stood by him .</l>
     <l n="27">A lovely vision ! Moving , or at rest ,</l>
     <l n="28">Ever a rapture Rachel seemed of grace</l>
     <l n="29">Which but that moment that felicity</l>
     <l n="30">Of posture or of gesture had attained ,</l>
     <l n="31">By accident , yet kept it , through all change ,</l>

   <p>BOOK VIII .</p>
   <p>STEPHEN MARTYR .</p>
   <p>As Stephen approaches the temple , he is suddenly arrested and brought before the Sanhedrim . There making his defence , he is interrupted with hostile demonstrations , instigated by Shimei . On this , he bursts out with noble indignation , which furnishes the desired occasion for a cry against him of “ Blasphemy ! ” from all , and for a violent hurrying forth of the prisoner without the walls to be stoned . A file of Roman soldiers confronts and stays the tumultuous crowd ; but , after parley conducted by Shimei with the centurion , their leader , the rout is suffered to proceed . Meantime , however , a little company of sympathizing Christians , including Rachel with the three from Bethany , have gathered round Stephen and listened to cheerful , tranquillizing words from him . After the stoning , these friends carry the body of Stephen for laving to the pool of Siloam , whence by moonlight up Olivet to Bethany . Here they lay it in a room of Martha and Mary 's house until morning .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The morrow morn broke fair in Bethany ,</l>
     <l n="2">And Ruth rose early from unquiet sleep ;</l>
     <l n="3">Rachel likewise , who slept in Mary 's house .</l>
     <l n="4">The sun had not yet risen , but in the west</l>
     <l n="5">The moon hung whitening opposite the dawn ,</l>
     <l n="6">When Ruth , her children left asleep , went forth</l>
     <l n="7">To feel the freshness of the morning air</l>
     <l n="8">Without , and water from the village well</l>
     <l n="9">To draw , both for the slaking of her thirst</l>
     <l n="10">And for the cooling of her brow that burned</l>
     <l n="11">And of her throbbing temples . At the well</l>
     <l n="12">Rachel she met who earlier still was forth</l>
     <l n="13">On the like errand . The two women hailed</l>
     <l n="14">And kissed each other . Ruth to Rachel then</l>
     <l n="15">Said : “ Thou art not , I trow , this morning come</l>
     <l n="16">Hither the long way from Jerusalem ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="17">“ Nay , Ruth , ” said Rachel , “ here the yesternight</l>
     <l n="18">With Mary and Martha I abode a guest . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">“ How fresh the wind is , ” Ruth said , “ hither blown</l>
     <l n="20">From off the western sea ! Us , underneath</l>
     <l n="21">The crest of Olivet , it lights upon</l>
     <l n="22">Descending , broken , like a breath from heaven .</l>
     <l n="23">What a delicious balm ! ”</l>
     <l n="24">“ About my brow , ”</l>
     <l n="25">Said Rachel , “ gratefully I feel the air ,</l>
     <l n="26">Attempered so , soft flowing , as if one</l>
     <l n="27">That loved me like a mother gently stroked</l>
     <l n="28">My temples to undo a band of pain</l>
     <l n="29">Bound round them . ”</l>
     <l n="30">“ And , in sooth , ” the other said ,</l>
     <l n="31">Now looking narrowly at Rachel 's face ,</l>
     <l n="32">“ Thou seemest sad of favor , Rachel . Thou ,</l>
     <l n="33">Thou too , so young , hast then thy cause to grieve !</l>
     <l n="34">It is a sad world and a weary . But —</l>
     <l n="35">Forgive me if such quick instinctive fears</l>
     <l n="36">Be selfish , I am wife and mother — aught</l>
     <l n="37">Of evil tidings bringest thou me ? Spare not</l>
     <l n="38">To speak . Thou wilt but answer to the dreams</l>
     <l n="39">I had this night , portending nameless ill .</l>
     <l n="40">Stephen — I fear for him . He yesterday</l>
     <l n="41">Left me beyond his wont oppressed in spirit ,</l>
     <l n="42">And has not since returned . Strange — yet not strange ;</l>
     <l n="43">Sometimes the livelong night he spends in prayer</l>
     <l n="44">Alone upon the top of Olivet</l>
     <l n="45">Or in the shadows of Gethsemane . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="46">“ Ruth , ” Rachel said , “ the Angel of the Lord</l>
     <l n="47">Round His beloved , like the mountains round</l>
     <l n="48">Jerusalem , encampeth ever ; he</l>
     <l n="49">Of God 's beloved is , and guarded well ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="50">But Ruth scarce listened ; she insisting said :</l>
     <l n="51">“ Perhaps of Stephen some report thou bringest ,</l>
     <l n="52">Hint doubtless of new danger threatening him ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="53">“ Nay , Ruth , no longer danger threatens now</l>
     <l n="54">Thy husband ; that is past , and he is safe . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="55">“ Thank God , ” said Ruth ; “ but stay , I dare not yet</l>
     <l n="56">Thank God . Tell me , have then our rulers ceased</l>
     <l n="57">To frown on Stephen preaching Jesus Christ ?</l>
     <l n="58">Or Stephen , will he cease and preach no more ?</l>
     <l n="59">This cannot be , for Stephen is such stuff</l>
     <l n="60">As never yet did bend to mortal beck ;</l>
     <l n="61">And that — our rulers surely have not changed</l>
     <l n="62">Thus suddenly their mind . Thou art deceived ,</l>
     <l n="63">They have deceived thee — Stephen is not safe ;</l>
     <l n="64">It is their guile to make us think him safe ,</l>
     <l n="65">He off his guard will fall an easier prey</l>
     <l n="66">Into their hands . Rachel , it was not kind ,</l>
     <l n="67">Not faithful in thee so to be deceived .</l>
     <l n="68">More love had made thee more suspicious . I</l>
     <l n="69">Suspect forever everybody ; thee</l>
     <l n="70">Now I suspect . Thou keepest something back ,</l>
     <l n="71">Or haply palterest with a double sense .</l>
     <l n="72">Rachel , I charge thee , I adjure thee , speak</l>
     <l n="73">And tell me all . Stephen is dead ! Say that —</l>
     <l n="74">Is dead ! Thou meantest that by , ‘ He is safe . ’</l>
     <l n="75">They have stoned him , stoned my husband , stoned the man</l>
     <l n="76">That was the truest Hebrew of them all ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="77">Though by her words Ruth challenged frank reply ,</l>
     <l n="78">Yet by her tones and by her eager looks</l>
     <l n="79">She deprecated more what she invoked .</l>
     <l n="80">This Rachel saw , and answered not a word .</l>
     <l n="81">Then Ruth gainsaid what Rachel would not say :</l>
     <l n="82">“ They have not done it , could not do it , he —</l>
     <l n="83">Rachel , it is not true , unsay it , quick ,</l>
     <l n="84">It was a cruel jest to tease me so ,</l>
     <l n="85">Thou art not a wife , thou art not a mother , else</l>
     <l n="86">Thou never hadst conceived so ill a jest ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="87">Rachel was tortured , but she could not speak ,</l>
     <l n="88">And Ruth , secure in sense of respite yet ,</l>
     <l n="89">Went on invoking what she would not hear :</l>
     <l n="90">“ Why art thou silent ? Speak , and keep not back</l>
     <l n="91">The truth , whatever it may be ; there 's naught</l>
     <l n="92">So soothing and so healing as the truth .</l>
     <l n="93">But I will not believe that he is dead .</l>
     <l n="94">Thou didst not know my husband . Dead ! dead ! dead !</l>
     <l n="95">I tell thee , Rachel , that is something past</l>
     <l n="96">Imagining dreadful , hopeless . To be dead</l>
     <l n="97">Is — not to love , and not to speak to those</l>
     <l n="98">Who loved and love thee , not to hear them speak ,</l>
     <l n="99">Saying they loved and love thee and lament</l>
     <l n="100">They ever gave thee cause of grief and now</l>
     <l n="101">Are different and would die a thousand deaths</l>
     <l n="102">To have been different then when thou couldst know —</l>
     <l n="103">Death , Rachel ,— but of death what canst thou learn ,</l>
     <l n="104">For thou art but a child and never wast ,</l>
     <l n="105">Never , to such a husband such a wife —</l>
     <l n="106">To vex the noblest heart that ever broke ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="107">Rachel at first had listened with dismay ,</l>
     <l n="108">And nothing found to answer to Ruth 's words ,</l>
     <l n="109">Whose words indeed flowed on and made no pause</l>
     <l n="110">For answer , as if she in truest truth</l>
     <l n="111">Sought not the answer that she seemed to seek ,</l>
     <l n="112">Would fain postpone it rather , or avert .</l>
     <l n="113">But when at length the utterance of Ruth 's thought</l>
     <l n="114">From converse passed into soliloquy</l>
     <l n="115">And the deep secret of her soul revealed ,</l>
     <l n="116">Then Rachel caught a welcome gleam of hope .</l>
     <l n="117">A sign of grace she saw or seemed to see</l>
     <l n="118">At work for Ruth within her heart of grief ,</l>
     <l n="119">Transmuting human sorrow to divine</l>
     <l n="120">Repentance , and for pain preparing peace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="121">“ Let us go in together , ” Rachel said ,</l>

     <l n="126">Then they went in , and Ruth bestirred herself</l>
     <l n="127">To make a cheer of welcome for her guest .</l>
     <l n="128">That momentary truce to troubled thought</l>
     <l n="129">For Ruth , and interspace of quietness</l>
     <l n="130">From her own words which could not choose but flow</l>
     <l n="131">With helpless importunity till then ,</l>
     <l n="132">Gave Rachel needed chance to speak . She said :</l>

     <l n="147">With pity mingled , equal measure — tears</l>
     <l n="148">Orbing them large , shot through and through with light</l>
     <l n="149">Of heavenly hope for Ruth — but , more than all</l>
     <l n="150">A subtly sweet insinuating tone ,</l>

     <l n="175">To the place where in quietude reposed</l>
     <l n="176">That slumberer late so violently lulled</l>
     <l n="177">To this so placid sleep . The room was flushed</l>
     <l n="178">With hue of gold in hangings round the walls</l>
     <l n="179">And rugs of russet muffling deep the floor ,</l>
     <l n="180">That made a kind of inner light diffused ,</l>
     <l n="181">Like sunshine without sun and shadowless .</l>
     <l n="182">A golden-curtained window opened east ,</l>
     <l n="183">And east the upturned face of Stephen looked ,</l>

     <l n="185">So lying that , had he his eyelids raised ,</l>
     <l n="186">He without moving might have seen the morn .</l>
     <l n="187">The rest , with one accord not entering , stood</l>
     <l n="188">About the door without , silent , and saw</l>

     <l n="190">That instant , lo , from out the breaking dawn</l>
     <l n="191">A level sunbeam through the curtain slipped</l>
     <l n="192">And touched the fair translucent face with light .</l>
     <l n="193">Ruth marked it and she testified and said ,</l>

     <l n="204">Within him and prevent this sacrifice —</l>
     <l n="205">Accomplished all without my help , nay , all</l>
     <l n="206">In spite of my resistance ! O my God ,</l>
     <l n="207">How hast Thou humbled me ! To have had no part ,</l>

     <l n="214">And if my share be heavier even than his —</l>
     <l n="215">To live bereaved more grievous martyrdom</l>
     <l n="216">Than to have died — this too is my desert ,</l>

     <l n="360">O Ruth , in His pavilion God did hide</l>

     <l n="369">He always told me that the heart of Christ</l>

   <p>BOOK X .</p>
   <p>SAUL AT BETHANY .</p>
   <p>At the funeral service for Stephen , Shimei was a skulking attendant . He catches at a mention there overheard by him of the name of Saul in connection with that of Stephen , to plot an instigated persecuting visit on Saul 's part to Bethany ; Shimei hoping that Saul will thus encounter his own sister identified as a Christian . Saul takes a band of men and makes the visit . He finds his intended victims all together at the house of Ruth condoling with her — Rachel indeed among them . After sharp inward conflict , and much effort put forth without success to make his victims abjure their faith , Saul finally takes them to prison . But Rachel , she vainly entreating to share her companions ’ fate , he leaves behind . She takes upon herself the charge of Ruth 's children in their own home , where Saul , month after month , secretly sends to her supply of every need .</p>

    <head>SAUL AT BETHANY .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Among the sons of God , when these one day</l>
     <l n="2">Came to present themselves before the Lord ,</l>
     <l n="3">Satan came also ; and so Shimei ,</l>
     <l n="4">Amid the throng that mourned at Stephen 's death ,</l>
     <l n="5">Intruded . With smooth face of sanctimony ,</l>
     <l n="6">Skulking to be unseen or heeded not ,</l>
     <l n="7">He hovered furtive on the outer edge</l>
     <l n="8">Of audience , when those words of praise were said</l>
     <l n="9">To hearten — eye and ear alert to mark</l>
     <l n="10">All that befell . His thought was , ‘ Here perhaps</l>
     <l n="11">I shall learn something to the true behoof</l>
     <l n="12">And profit of our cause — right aim secure</l>
     <l n="13">For the next blow of vengeance to be struck . ’</l>
     <l n="14">The name of Saul mysteriously conjoined</l>
     <l n="15">With Rachel 's , in abhorrent prophecy</l>
     <l n="16">As seemed — this , Shimei caught at eagerly</l>
     <l n="17">And said , ‘ Aha ! ’</l>
     <l n="18">Then , as the throng dispersed</l>
     <l n="19">All to their several homes , straight Shimei</l>
     <l n="20">Went to seek Saul . Him found that spy malign</l>
     <l n="21">With the chief priests in council , plotting deep</l>
     <l n="22">To hunt the sect of Jesus to the death .</l>
     <l n="23">These had armed Saul with writ and warrant sealed</l>
     <l n="24">Empowering him to enter where he would ,</l>
     <l n="25">House after house , and whomsoever found ,</l>
     <l n="26">Man be it or woman , guilty of belief</l>
     <l n="27">In Jesus as Messiah , such to seize</l>
     <l n="28">And drag to prison .</l>
     <l n="29">Instantly conceived</l>
     <l n="30">Shimei a subtle snare to enmesh the feet</l>
     <l n="31">Of Saul . The proud young zealot Pharisee</l>
     <l n="32">Should be set on to visit first in search</l>
     <l n="33">Those homes of Bethany ; where , unadvised</l>
     <l n="34">Perhaps , so Shimei guessed , the brother might ,</l>
     <l n="35">To his dismay , find his own sister one</l>
     <l n="36">With the disciples of the Nazarene .</l>
     <l n="37">Then to make prisoner his own flesh and blood ,</l>
     <l n="38">Or openly spare Rachel for kin 's sake —</l>
     <l n="39">This , scandal against scandal doubtful weighed ,</l>
     <l n="40">Would be the hard alternative to Saul .</l>

     <l n="41">“ Beloved brother Saul , ” so Shimei spoke ,</l>
     <l n="42">“ I mourned at Stephen 's funeral to-day .</l>
     <l n="43">Not loud , you know , but deep , my mourning was ;</l>
     <l n="44">Not loud , for I am modest , and my wish</l>
     <l n="45">Was less to be seen than to see ; but deep ,</l>
     <l n="46">For there was cause , to one that loved you , Saul ,</l>
     <l n="47">To be sincerely sad on your behalf .</l>
     <l n="48">Incredible it seems , they spoke your name ,</l>
     <l n="49">Not , as might honor it , with hate and dread ,</l>
     <l n="50">But very ambiguously , to say the least .</l>
     <l n="51">In fact , I fear you may be compromised ,</l>
     <l n="52">Unless you take prompt measures in the matter .</l>
     <l n="53">Hark you , a certain orator stood up</l>
     <l n="54">Who , after praising Stephen to his worth ,</l>
     <l n="55">Distinctly hinted Saul was looked upon</l>
     <l n="56">As hopeful future pervert to their cause</l>
     <l n="57">Predestined to fill Stephen 's vacant room .</l>
     <l n="58">The fellow founded on some prophecy</l>
     <l n="59">Which , as I gathered , Stephen had put forth .</l>
     <l n="60">Now this preposterous notion , with such folk ,</l>
     <l n="61">Is far more like to prosper , and thus be</l>
     <l n="62">Noised undesirably , than you might guess ,</l>
     <l n="63">As a report injurious to your name .</l>
     <l n="64">You will be tainted with disloyalty ,</l>
     <l n="65">In general esteem — to our great loss .</l>

     <l n="66">“ What I propose is that you strike a stroke</l>
     <l n="67">So sudden and so ringing and so aimed</l>

     <l n="69">This precious piece of prophecy in the bud ,</l>
     <l n="70">And put you out of reach of calumny .</l>
     <l n="71">You have your warrant and commission ; good ,</l>

     <l n="76">This very night , take you a trusty band</l>

     <l n="78">There Stephen lived , and there a hotbed yet</l>
     <l n="79">Thrives of this pestilent heresy . No place</l>
     <l n="80">Fitter than the abode and vicinage</l>
     <l n="81">Of your late overmatch in controversy</l>
     <l n="82">To make first theatre of the exploits</l>
     <l n="83">You aim at in this different field — field where ,</l>
     <l n="84">With odds so in your favor , you should win .</l>
     <l n="85">Easier far , given the right support , to drag</l>
     <l n="86">To dungeon and to death a hundred men</l>
     <l n="87">Or praying women , all as tame as sheep ,</l>
     <l n="88">Than one impracticable fellow like</l>

     <l n="109">Either by pure fortuity , or else</l>
     <l n="110">With malice the most exquisitely wise ,</l>
     <l n="111">Had hit the quivering quick of Saul 's sore pride .</l>
     <l n="112">Saul winced visibly , and Shimei , satisfied ,</l>
     <l n="113">Left him alone the prey of his own thoughts .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="114">Saul 's thoughts were visions rather ; first , he saw</l>

     <l n="116">Bowed beautiful beneath a brother 's scorn ,</l>
     <l n="117">Like a meek flower broken with tempest ; then ,</l>
     <l n="118">Stephen he saw , his face with God in him</l>
     <l n="119">Afire , before the council ; next , that face</l>
     <l n="120">Toward heaven upturned , he , far within the veil</l>
     <l n="121">Agaze , beholding there the glory of God ;</l>
     <l n="122">Once more , the martyr lifting holy hands</l>
     <l n="123">On high , with his last breath praying for those</l>

     <l n="125">Rachel the while — she rather felt than seen —</l>
     <l n="126">With tears that did not gather , but that made</l>
     <l n="127">Her deep eyes deeper than the soundless sea ,</l>
     <l n="128">Looking at him . Swift then the vision changed ,</l>
     <l n="129">And he saw Stephen in the temple court</l>
     <l n="130">Turn suddenly round on Saul his blinding face</l>
     <l n="131">To threaten him with promise that , one day ,</l>
     <l n="132">He , Saul himself , should grovel in the dust</l>
     <l n="133">Before the feet of Jesus crucified !</l>
     <l n="134">Those visions were as when the lightning-flash ,</l>
     <l n="135">By night , fast following lightning-flash , reveals ,</l>
     <l n="136">One instant and no more , the world , but prints</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="138">The final vision wrought a fierce revolt</l>

     <l n="140">The earlier visions almost made him feel .</l>
     <l n="141">As with a mortal gripe , his vise-like will</l>
     <l n="142">Clutched at his heart and held it fast and hard .</l>
     <l n="143">Scorning to be diverted from his path</l>
     <l n="144">Because , forsooth , the meddling Shimei</l>
     <l n="145">Pointed it out to him offensively ,</l>
     <l n="146">Saul moved at once to go to Bethany .</l>
     <l n="147">Seven servitors he chose , strong men whom use</l>
     <l n="148">Had , hand and heart , seasoned to such employ —</l>

     <l n="150">Again the moon shone , as the yesternight ,</l>
     <l n="151">And flooded heaven and earth with glory mild .</l>
     <l n="152">But her mild glory now was a rebuke</l>
     <l n="153">To human passion , not a balm to pain .</l>
     <l n="154">With swords and staves armed , as that night came they</l>
     <l n="155">Who looked for Jesus in Gethsemane —</l>
     <l n="156">The needless lamps and torches in their hands</l>
     <l n="157">With flare and smoke affronting the moonlight —</l>
     <l n="158">They marched , those seven , following the guide with Saul .</l>
     <l n="159">At first these chattered lightly as they walked ,</l>

     <l n="161">And his grim purpose in his pace expressed ,</l>
     <l n="162">Urgent and swift , taxing their utmost strength</l>
     <l n="163">To follow and not fall behind , quite quelled</l>
     <l n="164">The social spirit in all , and on all went</l>
     <l n="165">In sullen silence like their chief . Like him ,</l>

   <p>BOOK XI .</p>
   <p>SAUL AND HIRANI .</p>
   <p>Saul , ill-content with his own prosperity in persecution , retires gloomily , late at night , to his desolated home . He vainly tries to sleep , and , rising very early , goes to consult Gamaliel . Returning , he encounters Shimei , who , with gibes , instigates a further act of persecution on Saul 's part , cunningly contriving it to make refusal impossible . Saul attempting the arrest proposed by Shimei meets with opposition , which the latter has secretly inspired . The persecutor in consequence narrowly escapes violent death , being rescued at the critical moment by Shimei ; who himself , with a band of servitors , makes the arrest unsuccessfully attempted by Saul alone . The man arrested confesses Jesus before the Sanhedrim , constant against every inducement to deny his Lord . He is scourged , at the instance of Shimei , and finally , at the instance of Mattathias , stoned ; Saul in both cases giving his vote against the man .</p>

     <l n="1">With large prosperity and little joy ,</l>
     <l n="2">Thus the first stage of that ‘ straight path ’ foreseen</l>
     <l n="3">By him to Rachel , ‘ traced in blood and tears , ’</l>
     <l n="4">Saul had accomplished , and the night was late ;</l>
     <l n="5">He parted from his men and was alone .</l>
     <l n="6">Alone and moody , by the westering moon ,</l>
     <l n="7">His face downcast turned absently toward what</l>
     <l n="8">Late was his home , home longer not to him ,</l>
     <l n="9">With footstep slow suspended by sad thought —</l>
     <l n="10">Which had no goal , but ever round and round</l>
     <l n="11">On one fixed centre hopelessly revolved —</l>
     <l n="12">Saul paced the still streets of Jerusalem ,</l>
     <l n="13">Like a soul seeking rest and finding none .</l>

     <l n="20">And that great gulf impassable between</l>
     <l n="21">Her and himself yawning ! he hands imbrued</l>

     <l n="23">But he most hateful counted bringing home ,</l>
     <l n="24">Her innocent white hands to touch , and feel</l>
     <l n="25">The difference ! Therefore he fled because</l>

     <l n="28">Alone and lonely , sojourner might be</l>

   <p>BOOK XII .</p>
   <p>SAUL AND THE APOSTLES .</p>
   <p>Again deeply distressed in heart , Saul at set of sun withdraws to the top of Olivet for solitary thought . There falling asleep , after pensive soliloquy , he dreams that Shimei has followed him thither , and that he now pours a characteristic strain of sneer and instigation into his ear . This rouses him , and he goes moodily home . After a long , deep slumber there , he resolves on undertaking what he dreamed that Shimei proposed , namely , the arrest of the apostles . His men fail him at the pinch , and Saul bitterly upbraids them , declaring strongly that their renegade behavior only determines him the more sternly to root utterly out the pestilent Galilaean heresy , at whatever cost of exertion and blood and tears .</p>

   <p>BOOK XIII .</p>
   <p>SAUL AND SERGIUS .</p>
   <p>After further persecution accomplished by him in Judaea , Saul , with spirits recovered , sets out for Damascus to carry thither the persecuting sword . Pausing on the brow of hill Scopus to survey Jerusalem just left , he soliloquizes . At the same moment , there rides up a troop of Roman horse escorting a man who turns out to be Sergius Paulus , an old-time acquaintance of Saul 's , also bound to Damascus . The two pursue their journey together , highly enjoying their ride in that charming season of spring weather , and delightedly conversing on the way . They talk over Greek literature , and in particular by starlight at the close of the first day 's journey , Sergius Paulus having by occasion recited an apposite passage of Homer , Saul matches and contrasts this first with a psalm of David , and then additionally with a strain from the prophet Isaiah . This gives rise to conversation on ensuing days , in which religious questions are discussed . Sergius declares himself an atheist of the Epicurean sort , and he plies Saul with incredulous inquiries about the religion of the Jews — Saul answering with Hebrew conviction and earnestness . The two part company at Neapolis ( Shechem ) because Sergius Paulus halts there , and Saul , in the spirit of true Jewish strictness , will for his part not rest till he has quite passed the bounds of Samaria .</p>

   <p>BOOK XIV .</p>
   <p>FOR DAMASCUS .</p>
   <p>Coming together again at Caesarea Philippi ( Paneas , Banias ) after an interval of days , Saul and Sergius cross the southern spur of Hermon . A violent thunderstorm comes slowly up during the afternoon , which gives Sergius occasion , by way of mask to his own secret disquietude , to quote his Epicurean poet Lucretius on the subject of Jupiter 's control of thunderbolts . As the storm increases in violence , the fears of Sergius overpower him , and he breaks down at last into a deprecatory prayer and vow to Jupiter . Saul then , the storm still raging , rehearses from Scripture appropriate fragments of psalm , timing them to the various successive bursts of tempest . The sound of a tranquil human voice has a quieting effect on Sergius , and even on the frightened steeds of the two travellers . The storm ceases , and they pass the night under a serene sky , ready to set out the next morning for the last stage of their journey to Damascus .</p>

Sergius applies his interpretation of the occurrence , and Saul finishes his journey on foot , blind , led by the hand into Damascus .</p>
