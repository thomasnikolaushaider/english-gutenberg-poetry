    <head>CHAPTER I .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">An idle story with an idle moral !</l>
     <l n="2">Why do I tell it , at the risk of quarrel</l>
     <l n="3">With nobler themes ? The world , alas ! is so ,</l>
     <l n="4">And who would gather truth must bend him low ,</l>
     <l n="5">Nor fear to soil his knees with graveyard ground ,</l>
     <l n="6">If haply there some flower of truth be found .</l>
     <l n="7">For human nature is an earthy fruit ,</l>
     <l n="8">Mired at the stem and fleshy at the root ,</l>
     <l n="9">And thrives with folly 's mixon best o'erlaid ,</l>
     <l n="10">Nor less divinely so , when all is said .</l>
     <l n="11">Brave lives are lived , and worthy deeds are done</l>
     <l n="12">Each virtuous day , ‘ neath the all-pitying sun ;</l>
     <l n="13">But these are not the most , perhaps not even</l>
     <l n="14">The surest road to our soul 's modern heaven .</l>
     <l n="15">The best of us are creatures of God 's chance</l>
     <l n="16">( Call it His grace ) , which works deliverance ;</l>
     <l n="17">The rest mere pendulums ‘ twixt good and ill ,</l>
     <l n="18">Like soldiers marking time while standing still .</l>
     <l n="19">‘ Tis all their strategy , who have lost faith</l>
     <l n="20">In things Divine beyond man 's life and death ,</l>
     <l n="21">Pleasure and pain . Of heaven what know we ,</l>
     <l n="22">Save as unfit for angels ’ company ,</l>
     <l n="23">Say rather hell 's ? We cling to sins confessed ,</l>
     <l n="24">And say our prayers still hoping for the best .</l>
     <l n="25">We fear old age and ugliness and pain ,</l>
     <l n="26">And love our lives , nor look to live again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="27">I do but parable the crowd I know ,</l>
     <l n="28">The human cattle grazing as they go ,</l>
     <l n="29">Unheedful of the heavens . Here and there</l>
     <l n="30">Some prouder , may be , or less hungry steer</l>
     <l n="31">Lifting his face an instant to the sky ,</l>
     <l n="32">And left behind as the bent herd goes by ,</l>
     <l n="33">Or stung to a short madness , tossing wild</l>
     <l n="34">His horns aloft , and charging the gay field ,</l>
     <l n="35">Till the fence stops him , and he vanquished too ,</l>
     <l n="36">Turns to his browsing — lost his Waterloo .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="37">The moral of my tale I leave to others</l>
     <l n="38">More bold , who point the finger at their brothers ,</l>
     <l n="39">And surer know than I which way is best</l>
     <l n="40">To virtue 's goal , where all of us find rest ,</l>
     <l n="41">Whether in stern denial of things sweet ,</l>
     <l n="42">Or yielding timely , lest life lose its feet</l>
     <l n="43">And fall the further .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="44">A plain tale is mine</l>
     <l n="45">Of naked fact , unconscious of design ,</l>
     <l n="46">Told of the world in this last century</l>
     <l n="47">Of man 's ( not God 's ) disgrace , the XIXth . We</l>
     <l n="48">Have made it all a little as it is</l>
     <l n="49">In our own images and likenesses ,</l>
     <l n="50">And need the more forgiveness for our sin .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="51">Therefore , my Muse , impatient to begin ,</l>
     <l n="52">I bid thee fearless forward on thy road :</l>
     <l n="53">Steer thou thy honest course ‘ twixt bad and good .</l>
     <l n="54">Know this , in art that thing alone is evil</l>
     <l n="55">Which shuns the one plain word that shames the devil .</l>
     <l n="56">Tell truth without preamble or excuse ,</l>
     <l n="57">And all shall be forgiven thee — all , my Muse !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="58">In London then not many years ago</l>
     <l n="59">There lived a lady of high fashion , who</l>
     <l n="60">For her friends ’ sake , if any still there be</l>
     <l n="61">Who hold her virtues green in memory ,</l>
     <l n="62">Shall not be further named in this true tale</l>
     <l n="63">Than as Griselda or the Lady L .,</l>
     <l n="64">Such , if I err not , was the second name</l>
     <l n="65">Her parents gave when to the font she came ,</l>
     <l n="66">And such the initial letter bravely set</l>
     <l n="67">On her coach door , beneath the coronet ,</l>
     <l n="68">Which bore her and her fortunes — bore , alas !</l>
     <l n="69">For , as in this sad world all things must pass ,</l>
     <l n="70">However great and nobly framed and fair :</l>
     <l n="71">Griselda , too , is of the things that were .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="72">But while she lived Griselda had no need</l>
     <l n="73">Of the world 's pity . She was proudly bred</l>
     <l n="74">And proudly nurtured . Plenty her full horn</l>
     <l n="75">Had fairly emptied out when she was born ,</l>
     <l n="76">And dowered her with all bounties . She was fair</l>
     <l n="77">As only children of the noblest are ,</l>
     <l n="78">And brave and strong and opulent of health ,</l>
     <l n="79">Which made her take full pleasure of her wealth .</l>
     <l n="80">She had a pitying scorn of little souls</l>
     <l n="81">And little bodies , levying heavy tolls</l>
     <l n="82">On all the world which was less strong than she .</l>
     <l n="83">She used her natural strength most naturally ,</l>
     <l n="84">And yet with due discretion , so that all</l>
     <l n="85">Stood equally in bondage to her thrall .</l>
     <l n="86">She was of that high godlike shape and size</l>
     <l n="87">Which has authority in all men 's eyes :</l>
     <l n="88">Her hair was brown , her colour white and red ,</l>
     <l n="89">Nor idly moved to blush . She held her head</l>
     <l n="90">Straight with her back . Her body , from the knee</l>
     <l n="91">Tall and clean shaped , like some well-nurtured tree ,</l>
     <l n="92">Rose finely finished to the finger tips ;</l>
     <l n="93">She had a noble carriage of the hips ,</l>
     <l n="94">And that proportionate waist which only art</l>
     <l n="95">Dares to divine , harmonious part with part .</l>
     <l n="96">But of this more anon , or rather never .</l>
     <l n="97">All that the world could vaunt for its endeavour</l>
     <l n="98">Was the fair promise of her ankles set</l>
     <l n="99">Upon a pair of small high-instepped feet ,</l>
     <l n="100">In whose behalf , though modestly , God wot ,</l>
     <l n="101">As any nun , she raised her petticoat</l>
     <l n="102">One little inch more high than reason meet</l>
     <l n="103">Was for one crossing a well-besomed street .</l>
     <l n="104">This was the only tribute she allowed</l>
     <l n="105">To human folly and the envious crowd ;</l>
     <l n="106">Nor for my part would I be found her judge</l>
     <l n="107">For her one weakness , nor appear to grudge</l>
     <l n="108">What in myself , as surely in the rest ,</l>
     <l n="109">Bred strange sweet fancies such as feet suggest .</l>
     <l n="110">We owe her all too much . This point apart ,</l>
     <l n="111">Griselda , modesty 's own counterpart ,</l>
     <l n="112">Moved in the sphere of folly like a star ,</l>
     <l n="113">Aloof and bright and most particular .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="114">By girlish choice and whim of her first will</l>
     <l n="115">She had espoused the amiable Lord L .,</l>
     <l n="116">A worthy nobleman , in high repute</l>
     <l n="117">For wealth and virtue , and her kin to boot ;</l>
     <l n="118">A silent man , well mannered and well dressed ,</l>
     <l n="119">Courteous , deliberate , kind , sublimely blessed</l>
     <l n="120">With fortune 's favours , but without pretence ,</l>
     <l n="121">Whom manners almost made a man of sense .</l>
     <l n="122">In early life he had aspired to fame</l>
     <l n="123">In the world of letters by the stratagem</l>
     <l n="124">Of a new issue , from his private press ,</l>
     <l n="125">Of classic bards in senatorial dress ,</l>
     <l n="126">“ In usum Marchionis . ” He had spent</l>
     <l n="127">Much of his youth upon the Continent ,</l>
     <l n="128">Purchasing marbles , bronzes , pictures , gems ,</l>
     <l n="129">In every town from Tiber unto Thames ,</l>
     <l n="130">And gaining store of curious knowledge too</l>
     <l n="131">On divers subjects that the world least knew :</l>
     <l n="132">Knowledge uncatalogued , and overlaid</l>
     <l n="133">With dust and lumber somewhere in his head .</l>
     <l n="134">A slumberous man , in whom the lamp of life</l>
     <l n="135">Had never quite been lighted for the strife</l>
     <l n="136">And turmoil of the world , but flickered down</l>
     <l n="137">In an uncertain twilight of its own ,</l>
     <l n="138">With an occasional flash , that only made</l>
     <l n="139">A deeper shadow for its world of shade .</l>
     <l n="140">When he returned to England , all admired</l>
     <l n="141">The taste of his collections , and inquired</l>
     <l n="142">To whose fair fortunate head the lot should fall</l>
     <l n="143">To wear these gems and jewels after all .</l>
     <l n="144">But years went by , and still unclaimed they shone ,</l>
     <l n="145">A snare and stumbling-block to more than one ,</l>
     <l n="146">Till in his fiftieth year ‘ twas vaguely said ,</l>
     <l n="147">Lord L. already had too long delayed .</l>
     <l n="148">Be it as it may , he abdicated life</l>
     <l n="149">The day he took Griselda to his wife .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="150">And then Griselda loved him . All agreed ,</l>
     <l n="151">The world 's chief sponsors for its social creed ,</l>
     <l n="152">That , whether poor Lord L. was or was not</l>
     <l n="153">The very fool some said and idiot ,</l>
     <l n="154">Or whether under cloak of dulness crass ,</l>
     <l n="155">He veiled that sense best suited to his case ,</l>
     <l n="156">Sparing his wit , as housewives spare their light ,</l>
     <l n="157">For curtain eloquence and dead of night ;</l>
     <l n="158">And spite of whispered tales obscurely spread ,</l>
     <l n="159">Doubting the fortunes of her nuptial bed ,</l>
     <l n="160">Here at this word all sides agreed to rest :</l>
     <l n="161">Griselda did her duty with the best .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="162">Yet , poor Griselda ! When in lusty youth</l>
     <l n="163">A love-sick boy I stood unformed , uncouth ,</l>
     <l n="164">And watched with sad and ever jealous eye</l>
     <l n="165">The vision of your beauty passing by ,</l>
     <l n="166">Why was it that that brow inviolate ,</l>
     <l n="167">That virginal courage yet unscared by fate ,</l>
     <l n="168">That look the immortal queen and huntress wore</l>
     <l n="169">To frightened shepherds ’ eyes in days of yore</l>
     <l n="170">Consoled me thus , and soothed unconsciously ,</l>
     <l n="171">And stilled my jealous fears I knew not why ?</l>
     <l n="172">How shall I tell the secret of your soul</l>
     <l n="173">Which then I blindly guessed , or how cajole</l>
     <l n="174">My boyhood 's ancient folly to declare</l>
     <l n="175">Now in my wisdom the dear maid you were ,</l>
     <l n="176">Though such the truth ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="177">Griselda 's early days</l>
     <l n="178">Of married life were not that fitful maze</l>
     <l n="179">Of tears and laughter which betoken aught ,</l>
     <l n="180">Changed or exchanged , of pain with pleasure bought ,</l>
     <l n="181">Of maiden freedom conquered and subdued ,</l>
     <l n="182">Of hopes new born and fears of womanhood .</l>
     <l n="183">Those who then saw Griselda saw a child</l>
     <l n="184">Well pleased and happy , thoughtlessly beguiled</l>
     <l n="185">By every simplest pleasure of her age ,</l>
     <l n="186">Gay as a bird just issued from its cage ,</l>
     <l n="187">When every flower is sweet . No eye could trace</l>
     <l n="188">Doubt or disquiet written on her face ,</l>
     <l n="189">Where none there was . And , if the truth be told ,</l>
     <l n="190">Griselda grieved not that Lord L. was old .</l>
     <l n="191">She found it well that her sweet seventeen</l>
     <l n="192">Should live at peace with fifty , and was seen</l>
     <l n="193">Just as she felt , contented with her lot ,</l>
     <l n="194">Pleased with what was and pleased with what was not .</l>
     <l n="195">She held her husband the more dear that he</l>
     <l n="196">Was kind within the bounds of courtesy ,</l>
     <l n="197">And love was not as yet within her plan ,</l>
     <l n="198">And life was fair , and wisdom led the van .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="199">For she was wise — oh , wise ! She rose at eight</l>
     <l n="200">And played her scales till breakfast , and then sat</l>
     <l n="201">The morning through with staid and serious looks ,</l>
     <l n="202">Counting the columns of her household books ,</l>
     <l n="203">Her daily labour , or with puzzled head</l>
     <l n="204">Bent over languages alive and dead ,</l>
     <l n="205">Wise as , alas ! in life those only are</l>
     <l n="206">Who have not yet beheld a twentieth year .</l>
     <l n="207">Wealth had its duties , time its proper use ,</l>
     <l n="208">Youth and her marriage should be no excuse ;</l>
     <l n="209">Her education must be made complete !</l>
     <l n="210">Lord L. looked on and quite approved of it .</l>
     <l n="211">The afternoons , in sense of duty done ,</l>
     <l n="212">Went by more idly than the rest had gone .</l>
     <l n="213">If in the country , which Lord L. preferred ,</l>
     <l n="214">She had her horse , her dogs , her favourite bird ,</l>
     <l n="215">Her own rose-garden , which she loved to rake ,</l>
     <l n="216">Her fish to feed with bread crumbs in the lake ,</l>
     <l n="217">Her schools , old women , poor and almshouses ,</l>
     <l n="218">Her sick to visit , or her church to dress .</l>
     <l n="219">Lord L. was pleased to see her bountiful :</l>
     <l n="220">They hardly found the time to find it dull .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="221">In London , where they spent their second year ,</l>
     <l n="222">Came occupations suited to the sphere</l>
     <l n="223">In which they lived ; and to the just pretence</l>
     <l n="224">Of our Griselda 's high-born consequence ,</l>
     <l n="225">New duties to the world which no excuse</l>
     <l n="226">Admitted . She was mistress of L. House</l>
     <l n="227">And heir to its traditions . These must be</l>
     <l n="228">Observed by her in due solemnity .</l>
     <l n="229">Her natural taste , I think , repelled the noise ,</l>
     <l n="230">The rush , and dust , and crush of London joys ;</l>
     <l n="231">But habit , which becomes a second sense ,</l>
     <l n="232">Had reconciled her to its influence</l>
     <l n="233">Even in girlhood , and she long had known</l>
     <l n="234">That life in crowds may still be life alone ,</l>
     <l n="235">While mere timidity and want of ease</l>
     <l n="236">She never ranked among youth 's miseries .</l>
     <l n="237">She had her parents too , who made demand</l>
     <l n="238">Upon her thoughts and time , and close at hand</l>
     <l n="239">Sisters and friends . With these her days were spent</l>
     <l n="240">In simple joys and girlish merriment .</l>
     <l n="241">She would not own that being called a wife</l>
     <l n="242">Should make a difference in her daily life .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="243">Then London lacks not of attractions fit</l>
     <l n="244">For serious minds , and treasures infinite</l>
     <l n="245">Of art and science for ingenious eyes ,</l>
     <l n="246">And learning for such wits as would be wise ,</l>
     <l n="247">Lectures in classes , galleries , schools of art :</l>
     <l n="248">In each Griselda played conspicuous part —</l>
     <l n="249">Pupil and patron , ay , and patron-saint</l>
     <l n="250">To no few poor who live by pens and paint .</l>
     <l n="251">The world admired and flattered as a friend ,</l>
     <l n="252">And only wondered what would be the end .</l>

     <l n="254">Calm in its outline of romantic grace ,</l>
     <l n="255">Became a type even to the vulgar mind</l>
     <l n="256">Of all that beauty means when most refined ,</l>
     <l n="257">The visible symbol of a soul within ,</l>

     <l n="271">His Lordship ! I beheld a placid man ,</l>

     <l n="274">Time seemed to have been in doubt what lines to trace</l>
     <l n="275">Of youth or age , and so had left it bare ,</l>

     <l n="21">She had a store of zeal for each and all .</l>
     <l n="22">She pensioned poets , nobly took in hand</l>
     <l n="23">An emigration plan to Newfoundland ,</l>

     <l n="25">She visited St. George 's hospital ,</l>

     <l n="77">A human shape unseen yet understood .</l>

     <l n="349">We had been</l>
     <l n="350">One Sunday for a jaunt upon the Seine ,</l>
     <l n="351">We two — in Manton 's absence , now prolonged</l>
     <l n="352">To a third night — and in a steamboat , thronged</l>
     <l n="353">With idle bourgeois folk , whom the last glory</l>
     <l n="354">Of a late autumn had sent forth in foray</l>
     <l n="355">To Passy and St . Cloud , from stage to stage ,</l>
     <l n="356">Had made with heavy souls our pilgrimage ;</l>
     <l n="357">And homeward turning and with little zest ,</l>
     <l n="358">The fair day done , to love 's deserted nest</l>
     <l n="359">Had come with lagging feet and weary eyes ,</l>
     <l n="360">Expectant still of some new dark surprise ,</l>
     <l n="361">When the blow fell unsparing on her head ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="363">How did it happen , that last tragedy ?—</l>
     <l n="364">For tragedy it was , let none deny ,</l>
     <l n="365">Though all ignoble . Every soul of us</l>
     <l n="366">Touches one moment in death 's darkened house</l>
     <l n="367">The plane of the heroic , and compels</l>
     <l n="368">Men 's laughter into tears — ay , heaven 's and hell 's .</l>
     <l n="369">How did it happen ? There was that upon</l>
     <l n="370">Their faces at the door more than the tone</l>
     <l n="371">Of their replies , that warned us of the thing</l>
     <l n="372">We had not looked for in our questioning ;</l>
     <l n="373">And our lips faltered , and our ears , afraid ,</l>
     <l n="374">Shrank from more hearing . What was it they said</l>
     <l n="375">In their fool 's jargon , that he lay upstairs ?</l>
     <l n="376">He ? Manton ? The dispenser of our cares ?</l>
     <l n="377">The mountebank young reveller ? Suffering ? Ill ?</l>

     <l n="379">A sinister case ? Not dying ? Pitiful God !</l>
     <l n="380">Truly Thou smitest blindly with Thy rod .</l>
     <l n="381">For Manton was not worthy to die young ,</l>
     <l n="382">Beloved by her with blessings on her tongue .</l>
     <l n="383">And such a cause of death !</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="384">She never heard</l>
     <l n="385">The whole truth told , for each one spared his word ,</l>

     <l n="387">The thing was storied void of mystery ,</l>
     <l n="388">And thus they told it . Hardly had we gone</l>
     <l n="389">On our sad river outing , when from town</l>
     <l n="390">Manton had come with a gay troop of friends ,</l>
     <l n="391">Such as the coulisse of the opera lends ,</l>
     <l n="392">To breakfast at the inn and spend the day</l>
     <l n="393">In mirthful noise , as was his vagrant way .</l>
     <l n="394">A drunken frolic , and most insolent</l>
     <l n="395">To her whose honour with his own was blent ,</l>
     <l n="396">To end in this last tragedy . None knew</l>
     <l n="397">Quite how it happened , or a cause could shew</l>
     <l n="398">Further than this , that , rising from the table</l>
     <l n="399">The last to go , with steps perhaps unstable —</l>
     <l n="400">For they had feasted freely , and the stair</l>
     <l n="401">Was steep and iron-edged , and needed care ;</l>
     <l n="402">And singing , as he went , the selfsame song ,</l>
     <l n="403">Which I remembered , to the laughing throng ,</l>
     <l n="404">He had slipped his length , and fallen feet-first down .</l>
     <l n="405">When they picked him up his power to move was gone ,</l>
     <l n="406">Though he could speak . They laid him on a bed ,</l>
     <l n="407">Her bed , Griselda 's , and called in with speed</l>
     <l n="408">Such help of doctors and commissioners</l>
     <l n="409">As law prescribed , and medicine for their fears .</l>

     <l n="420">Unceasing , changeless , pregnant with all doom</l>
     <l n="421">Of insolent life that rises from its streets ,</l>

     <l n="506">A father 's welcoming a truant child ,</l>

     <l n="508">With hope “ the thing should not occur again . ”</l>
     <l n="509">His lips began to move as to some speech</l>
     <l n="510">Framed in this sense , as one might gently preach</l>

     <l n="512">Of duties owed , at least by those whose lives</l>

     <l n="516">Met his with a mute answer of surprise ,</l>
     <l n="517">Marking the unseemliness of all display</l>
     <l n="518">More strongly than with words , as who should say</l>
     <l n="519">Noblesse oblige . She took his outstretched hand ,</l>

     <l n="538">With her old kindness of the days of yore ,</l>
     <l n="539">And thanked me as one thanks for little things .</l>
     <l n="540">“ You have been , ” she said , “ an angel without wings ,</l>

     <l n="543">Change in her voice , “ there are things the world will say</l>
     <l n="544">Which are neither just nor kind , and , if to-day</l>

     <l n="551">And so , in truth , it was . Henceforth there lay</l>

     <l n="554">The gulf of a dead secret ; and , alas !</l>
     <l n="555">Who knows what subtle treacheries within ,</l>
     <l n="556">For virtue rends its witnesses of sin ,</l>
     <l n="557">And hearts are strangely fashioned by their fears .</l>
     <l n="558">We met no more in friendship through the years ,</l>
     <l n="559">Although I held her secret as my own ,</l>
     <l n="560">And fought her battles , her best champion ,</l>
     <l n="561">On many a stricken field in scandal 's war ,</l>
     <l n="562">Till all was well forgotten . From afar</l>
     <l n="563">I watched her fortunes still with tenderness ,</l>

     <l n="576">Its heroine lived to justify all hope</l>
     <l n="577">Of her long-suffering lord , that out of pain</l>
     <l n="578">Blessings would grow , and his house smile again</l>
     <l n="579">With the fulfilled expectance of an heir .</l>
     <l n="580">Griselda sat no longer in despair ,</l>
     <l n="581">Nor wasted her full life on dreams of folly ;</l>
     <l n="582">She had little time for moods of melancholy ,</l>
     <l n="583">Or heart to venture further in love 's ways ;</l>
     <l n="584">She was again the theme of all men 's praise ,</l>
     <l n="585">And suffered no man 's passion . Once a year ,</l>
     <l n="586">In the late autumn , when the leaves grew sere</l>
     <l n="587">She made retreat to a lay sisterhood ,</l>
     <l n="588">And lived awhile there for her soul 's more good ,</l>
     <l n="589">In pious meditation , fasts and prayer .</l>
     <l n="590">Some say she wore concealed a shirt of hair</l>
     <l n="591">Under her dresses , even at court balls ,</l>
     <l n="592">And certain ‘ tis that all Rome 's rituals</l>
     <l n="593">Were followed daily at the private Mass</l>
     <l n="594">In her new chauntry built behind Hans Place .</l>
     <l n="595">Lord L. approved of all she did , even this ,</l>

     <l n="597">He , gentle soul , grown garrulous with years ,</l>

     <l n="600">A prodigy of beauty and ways sage .</l>
     <l n="601">It was a vow , he said , once made in Rome ,</l>
     <l n="602">Had brought them this chief treasure of their home .</l>
     <l n="603">A vow ! The light world laughed — for miracles</l>

     <l n="608">— There is at Ostia , close beside the sea ,</l>
     <l n="609">A convent church , the same where years ago</l>
