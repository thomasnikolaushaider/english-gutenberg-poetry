     </lg>
     <p>Its a long time sin ’ thee an ’ me have met befoor , owd lad ,— Soa pull up thi cheer , an ’ sit daan , for ther 's noabdy moor welcome nor thee : Thi toppin 's grown whiter nor once ,— yet mi heart feels glad , To see ther 's a rooas o ’ thi cheek , an ’ a bit ov a leet i ’ thi e'e .</p>
     <p>Thi limbs seem to totter an ’ shake , like a crazy owd fence , ‘ At th ’ wind maks to tremel an ’ creak ; but tha still fills thi place ; An ’ it shows ‘ at tha'rt bless 'd wi ’ a bit o ’ gradely gooid sense , ‘ At i ’ spite o ’ thi years an ’ thi cares , tha still wears a smile o ’ thi face .</p>
     <p>Come fill up thi pipe — for aw knaw tha'rt reight fond ov a rick ,— An ’ tha 'll find a drop o ’ hooarm-brew 'd i ’ that pint up o'th ’ hob , aw dar say ; An ’ nah , wol tha'rt toastin thi shins , just scale th ’ foir , an ’ aw 'll side thi owd stick , Then aw 'll tell thi some things ‘ ats happen 'd sin tha went away .</p>
     <p>An ’ first of all tha mun knaw ‘ at aw hav n't been spar 'd , For trials an ’ troubles have come , an ’ mi heart has felt well nigh to braik ; An ’ mi wife , ‘ at tha knaws wor mi pride , an ’ mi fortuns has shared , Shoo bent under her griefs , an ’ shoo 's flown far , far away aat o ’ ther raik .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">My life 's like an owd gate</l>
       <l n="2">‘ ats nobbut one hinge for support ,</l>
       <l n="3">An ’ sometimes aw wish — aw 'm soa lonely —</l>
       <l n="4">at tother ‘ ud drop off wi ’ rust ;</l>
       <l n="5">But it has n't to be , for it seems</l>
       <l n="6">Life maks me his spooart ,</l>
       <l n="7">An ’ Deeath cannot even spare time ,</l>
       <l n="8">to turn sich an owd man into dust .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Last neet as aw sat an ’ watched th ’ yule log awd put on to th ’ fire , As it cracked , an ’ sparkled , an ’ flared up wi ’ sich gusto an ’ spirit , An ’ when it wor touch 'd it shone breeter , an ’ flared up still higher , Till at last aw 'd to shift th ’ cheer further back for aw could n't bide near it .</p>
     <p>Th ’ dull saand o ’ th ’ church bells coom to tell me one moor Christmas mornin ’ , Had come , for its welcome — but ha could aw welcome it when all aloan ? For th ’ snow wor fallin soa thickly , an ’ th ’ cold wind wor moanin , An ’ them ‘ at aw lov 'd wor asleep i ’ that cold church yard , under a stoan :</p>
     <p>Soa aw went to bed an ’ aw slept , an ’ then began dreamin , ‘ At mi wife stood by mi side , an ’ smiled , an ’ mi heart left off its beatin ’ , An ’ aw put aat mi hand , an ’ awoke , an ’ mornin ’ wor gleamin ’ ; An ’ its made me feel sorrowful , an aw cannot give ovver freatin .</p>
     <p>For aw think what a glorious Christmas day ‘ twod ha ’ been , If awd goan to that place , where ther 's noa moor cares , nor partin ’ , nor sorrow , For aw know shoo 's thear , or that dream aw sud nivver ha ’ seen , But aw 'll try to be patient , an ’ maybe shoo 'll come fotch me to-morrow .</p>
     <p>It 's forty ’ long summers an ’ winters , sin tha bade “ gooid bye , ” An ’ as fine a young fella tha wor , as iver aw met i ’ mi life ; When tha went to some far away land , thi fortune to try , An ’ aw stopt at hooam to toil on , becoss it wor th ’ wish o ’ my wife .</p>
     <p>An ’ shoo wor a bonny young wench , an ’ better nor bonny ,— Aw seem nah as if aw can see her , wi ’ th ’ first little bairn on her knee , An ’ we called it Ann , for aw liked that name best ov ony , An ’ fowk said it wor th ’ pictur o ’ th ’ mother , wi ’ just a strinklin o ’ me .</p>
     <p>An ’ th ’ next wor a lad , an ’ th ’ next wor a lad ! then a lass came ,— That made us caant six ,— an ’ six happier fowk niver sat to a meal , An ’ they grew like hop plants — full o ’ life — but waikly i ’ th ’ frame , An ’ at last one drooped , an ’ Deeath coom an ’ marked her with his seal .</p>
     <p>A year or two moor an ’ another seemed longin to goa , An ’ all we could do wor to smooth his deeath bed , ‘ at he might sleep sweeter — Then th ’ third seemed to sicken an ’ pine , an ’ we could n't say “ noa , ” For he said his sister had called , an ’ he wor most anxious to meet her —</p>
     <p>An ’ how we watched th ’ youngest , noa mortal can tell but misen , For we prized it moor , becoss it wor th ’ only one left us to cherish ; At last her call came , an ’ shoo luked sich a luk at us then , Which aw ne'er shall forget , tho mi mem'ry ov all other things perish .</p>
     <p>A few years moor , when awr griefs wor beginnin to lighten , Mi friends began askin my wife , if shoo felt hersen hearty an ’ strong ? An ’ aw niver saw at her face wor beginning to whiten , Till sho grew like a shadow , an ’ aw could n't even guess wrong .</p>
     <p>Then aw stood beside th ’ grave when th ’ saxton wor shovin in th ’ gravel , An ’ he said “ this last maks five , an ’ aw think ther 's just room for another , ” An ’ aw went an ’ left him , lonely an ’ heartsick to travel , Till th ’ time comes when aw may lig daan beside them four bairns an ’ ther mother .</p>
     <p>An ’ aw think what a glorious Christmas day ‘ twod ha been If aw 'd gooan to that place where ther 's noa moor cares , nor partin , nor sorrow ; An aw knaw they 're thear , or that dream aw should niver ha seen , But aw 'll try to be patient , an ’ maybe shoo 'll come fotch me to-morrow .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>If ther 's ony sooart o ’ fowk aw hate , it 's them at 's allus lukkin ’ aght for faults ;— hang it up ! they get soa used to it , wol they will n't see ony beauties if they are thear . They remind me ov a chap ‘ at aw knew at wed a woman ‘ at had a wart at th ’ end ov her nooas , but it war nobbut a little en , an ’ shoo wor a varry bonny lass for all that ; but when they 'd been wed a bit , an ’ th ’ newness had getten warn off , he began to fancy at this wart grew bigger ivery day , an ’ he stared at it , an ’ studied abaght it , wol when he luk 'd at his wife he could see nowt else , an ’ he kept dinging her up wi ’ it wol shoo felt varry mich troubled . But one day , as they wor gettin ’ ther dinner , he said , “ Nay , lass , aw niver did see sich a thing as that wart o ’ thy nooas is growing into ; if it gooas on tha 'll be like a rhynockoroo or a newnicorn or summat ! ”</p>
     <p>“ Well , ” shoo says , “ when tha wed me tha wed th ’ wart an ’ all , an ’ if tha does n't like it tha con lump it . ”</p>
     <p>“ Aw 've noa need to lump it , ” he says , “ for it 's lumpin ’ itsen or aw 'll gie nowt for it . ”</p>
     <p>Soa they went on , throo little to moor , till they 'd a regular fratch , an ’ as sooin as ’ he 'd getten his dinner , he off to his wark , an ’ shoo to her mother 's . When Jim coom back an ’ fan th ’ fire aght , an ’ noa wife , he felt rayther strange , but he wor detarmined to let her see ‘ at he could do baat her , soa he gate a bit o ’ summat to ait an ’ went to bed . This went on for two-o ’ - three days , an ’ he wor as miserable as iver he could be , but o'th ’ Setterdy he happened to meet her i'th ’ shambles , an ’ they booath stopped an ’ grinned , for they 'd nowt agean one another i'th ’ bothem .</p>
     <p>“ Nah , lass , ” he said , “ aw think it 's abaat time for thee to come hooam . ”</p>
     <p>“ Nay , aw 'll come nooan , ” shoo says , “ till aw 've getten shut o ’ this wart . ”</p>
     <p>“ Oh , ne'er heed that , lass ; it does n't luk hauf as big as it did , an ’ if tha wor all wart , aw 'd rayther have thi nor be as aw am . ”</p>
     <p>“ Soa shoo went back wi ’ him , an ’ throo that time to this he 's allus luk 'd for her beauties asteead ov her faults , an they get on swimmingly . One day shoo axed him if he thowt th ’ wart wor ony bigger ? ” “ A'a lass , ” he sed , “ thi een are soa breet , aw did n't know tha had one ! ”</p>
     <p>What aw want yo to do is to be charitable , an ’ if yo find ony faults , think — yo happen may have one or two yorsen . Ther 's net monny on us ‘ at 's killed wi sense , but he has n't th ’ leeast at 's enuff to know he 's a fooil .</p>

     <p>Aw once knew a chap they called old Sammy ; he used ta gaa wi a donkey , an th ’ mooast remarkable things abaat him wor his clogs an ’ his rags .

One day he war gain up Hepenstull Bunk , Jenny o ’ Jooans a ’ th ’ Long Lover wor goin up befoor him , an ’ whether it wor at her clogs were made a ’ his favrite pattern , or her ancles had summat abaat ‘ em different to what he 'd iver seen befoor , aw cannot tell , but it seems a feelin coom ovver him all at once , sich as he 'd niver had befoor , an ’ when he 'd managed ta overtak her , he sed , “ It 's loaning for heeat aw think , Jenny . ” “ Eea , aw think its likely for bein wut , ” shoo sed . “ Awve just been thinkin , ” sed Sammy , “ at if I wornt na a single old chap , aw should n't have to trail up an ’ daan in a lot a ’ rags like thease , for awm sure this jacket has hardly strength to hing o ’ mi rig , an ’ mi britches are soa full o ’ hoils wol awm feeared sometimes when awm puttin em on , at awst tummel throo an braik my neck . ” “ Well , reight enuff , a woife 's varry useful at times , ” shoo sed , “ but as tha has n't one if tha 'll learn mi thi jacket , aw 'll see if it cannot be mended far thi a bit . ” “ Aw allus thowt tha war a gooid sooart , Jenny , an ’ awl tak thi at thi word , ” he sed : so he pool 'd off his coit an gave it her an ’ it were arranged ‘ at he should call for it next neet . You may bet yor life he did n't forget , an when he saw it mended up , an ’ brushed wol it luk 'd ommost as gooid as new , he luk 'd first at it an then at her , an at last he sed , “ Aw think we should be able to get on varry weel together , what says ta ? ” Aw dooant know what shoo sed , but it wornt long befoor they wor wed , for Sammy thowt shoo 'd be worth her mait if it wor nobbut for mendin up his old duds . They had n't been wed long , when he axed her to mend his britches .— “ A'a , ” shoo sed , “ Aw cannot mend em , aw niver could sew i ’ mi life ! ” “ Why that is a tale , ” he sed , “ tha mended mi jacket all reight ! ” “ Nay , indeed aw nawther !— Aw mended nooon on it ! Aw sent it to th ’ tailor an paid for it doin . ” “ Then awm dropt on , ” sed Sammy , “ for aw expected tha 'd be able to do all sich like wark . ” “ Tha should niver expect owt an ’ then tha willnt get dropt on , ” shoo sed .— “ That , wor a bit o ’ varry gooid advice .</p>

       <l n="1">New Machinery &amp; c .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>It shows varry little sense for fowk to object to a new machine till they 've tried it , or to fancy it 'll be th ’ means o ’ smashin th ’ trade . Luk at th ’ paaer looms ; when they I wor started all th ’ hand-loom weyvers struck wark , becoss they said it ud do ‘ em all up , an ’ ther 'd be noa wark at all for weyvers in a bit ; but it has n't turn 'd aat soa , for ther 's moor weyvers i'th ’ country to-day , nor iver ther wor ; and they addle moor brass , an ’ awm sure they 've easier wark . For if this country does n't get new machines , other countries will , an ’ when we 're left behund hand an ’ connot meet ‘ em i'th ’ market , we'st be a deeal war off nor ony new invention can mak us . All at 's been done soa far has helped to mak us better off . They connot mak a machine to think , they 're forced to stop thear ; an ’ aw dooant daat if we 'd to live long enuff , ther 'd be a time when chaps ud ha nowt to do but think-but it 's to be hoaped ‘ at they 'd have summat else to think abaat nor rattenin ’ , or shooitin ’ , or ruinin ’ fowk . Aw 've tawk 'd to some abaat it , an ’ they say they 're foorced to do sum way to keep wages up , but if aw can tell em ha to mak brass goa farther , they 'll be content to give up th ’ Union . But aw think it goas far enuff — what they want is to keep it nearer hooam , to let less on it goa to th ’ ale haase , to spend less o ’ dog feightin ’ , pigeon flyin ’ , an ’ rat worryin ’ ; an ’ if they 'd niver spend owt withaat think in ’ whether it wor for ther gooid or net , they 'd find a deal moor brass i'th ’ drawer corner at th ’ month end , an ’ varry likely a nice little bit to fall back on i'th ’ Savings bank at th ’ year end . An a chap stands hauf an inch heigher when he 's a bankbook in his pocket ; an ’ butchers and grocers varry sooin begin to nod at him , an ’ ax if they can do owt for him . But if he goas on th'strap , an ’ happens to be a month behund , he 's foorced to stand o ’ one side till iverybody else gets sarved , an ’ then if he does n't like what 's left they tell him to goa leave it . It is n't what a chap addles , it 's what a chap saves ‘ at makes him rich .</p>
     <p>Sellin ’ drink has made mony a chap rich , an suppin it has made thaasands poor . But still aw must honestly say ‘ at aw cannot agree wi ’ teetotalism altogether . If noa men gate drunken , ther 'd be noa need for anybody to sign th ’ pledge ;— an ’ aw dooant think they goa th ’ reight way to get fowk to be sober . They publish papers , but what use is made on em ? Yo hardly iver see a midden emptied but what yo 'll find two or three pieces o'th ’ “ British Workman , ” or th ’ “ Temperance Advocate ” flyin ’ abaat ; an ’ they hold meetings an ’ spend a sight o ’ brass o ’ printin ’ an ’ praichin ’ , an ’ still they doant mak one teetotaller ‘ at ov a thaasand . Aw should advise em to try this way . Let em offer a £ 500 prize for him ‘ at can invent a drink as gooid takin ’ as ale — an ’ one , ‘ at will n't mak fowk drunk . Chaps mun sup summat when they 're away throo hooam , an it is'nt iverybody 's stumach ‘ at 's strong enuff to tak watter , unless it 's let daan wi summat ; an ’ ther is noa teetotal drink invented yet ‘ at 's any better nor Spenish - juice-watter . They 're all like pap . Coffee an ’ tea are all weel enuff , but if yo want that yo munnot goa to a Temperance Hotel for it . Aw'ye tried it monny a scoor times , but aw niver gate owt fit to sup , an ’ if it had n't been for th ’ drop o ’ rum aw gate ‘ em to put into it , aw could n't ha swallowed it . Tea an ’ coffee are things ‘ at dooant mend wi ’ warmin up , an ’ yo connot allus wait woll fowk mak it , an ’ soa if yo want to sup yo mun awther goa an ’ beg a drop o ’ watter , or pay fourpence for a glass o ’ belly vengeance , or yo mun get a glass o ’ drink — but yo 've noa need to get a dozzen . Teetotallers say it contains poison , an ’ noa daat it does — but it 's of a varry slow mak , an ’ if yo niver goa to excess yo may live to be a varry owd man , an ’ dee befoor it begins to operate , Ther wor once a chap killed hissel wi ’ aitin traitle parkin , but that 's noa reason we should n't have a bit o ’ brandy-snap at our fair . Aw allus think a teetotal lecturer is like a bottle o ’ pop . Ther 's a bit ov a crack to ‘ start wi ’ , an ’ a gooid deal o ’ fooamin , an ’ frothin ’ , an ’ fizzin ’ , but when it 's all ovver , an ’ settled daan , what 's left is varry poor stuff . Still aw think one teetotaller is worth moor nor a ship-load o ’ drunkards .</p>

     <p>Blackberries are ripe in September , an ’ we may consider th ’ year 's ripe , for when this month gets turned , things ‘ ll begin o ’ gooin ’ th ’ back way . Its vany wonderful when we look reight at it . This world 's a wonderful spot , an ’ ther 's a deal o ’ wonderful things in it . Ther 's some things at it 's varry wonderful to see , an ’ ther 's some things ’ at it 's wonderful net to see . Aw thowt it wor varry wonderful , a week or two sin ’ , when aw pass 'd Stanninley Station , ‘ at ther wor n't a chap wi ’ a dog under his arm ; it 's th ’ furst time aw iver pass 'd an ’ did n't see one . But aw niver think it 's wonderful for ther to be a fooil in a company ; an ’ aw dooant think its wonderful when aw find ‘ at th ’ biggest fooil has allus th ’ mooast to say .</p>
     <p>Nah , its a varry nice time o'th ’ year is this for fowk to have a bit of a pic-nic ;— aw dooant know owt ‘ at 's a better excuse for a chap to tighten his belly-band nor a pic-nic , becoss iverybody taks twice as mich stuff to ait as they know they 'll want , for fear fowk might think they wor shabby . If yo get a invite to a doo o ’ that mak ’ , be sure yo goa , if you 've owt of a twist . But talkin ’ abaat invites maks me study a bit . When yo get an invitation , allus think it ovver befoor yo tak ’ it Ax yorsen one or two questions abaat it . If yo think it 's becoss yo can play th ’ peanner , or becoss yo can sing — tell ‘ em yorterms . If yo think it 's becoss some owd uncle is likely to dee an ’ leeav yo a lot o ’ brass , an ’ they 've a dowter or two ‘ at is n't wed — tell ‘ em yor engaged ( to a lady ) . If yo think it 's becoss they fancy yor a shinin ’ leet — tell ‘ em yo 're gooan aat . I yo think it 's becoss they want to borrow some brass , an ’ yor daatful whether yo 'll iver get it back agean — tell ‘ em yo 've soa monny calls made on yo , wall yo 're feeard yo connot call o ’ them at present . But if yo think it 's just becoss they want yo , an ’ they 'll be glad to see yo , ’ put on yor hat an ’ off in a minit .</p>
     <p>Aw once knew a chap ‘ at had getten a invite to a doo , an ’ he wor gooin ’ to tak his wife wi ’ him ; an ’ he wor tellin ’ some mates what a shimmer shoo wor gooin ’ to cut . “ Mun , ” he says , “ sho 'll just luk like one o ’ them figures i'th ’ waxworks ! Aw 've bowt her a goold cheen as thick as my thum ; it 's cost ornmost a paand . An ’ tawk abaat a dress ! why , yo ’ niver saw sich a dress it 's a real Mary Antique ! Th ’ chap ‘ at sell 'd it me , said it had been made for th ’ Princess o ’ Wales , but it wor soa mich brass wol th ’ Prince could n't affoord to pay for't , so he let me have it cheap ; an ’ it 's just like buckram — it 'll stand ov an end . ” “ Why , ” said one o'th ’ chaps , “ the Princess will n't be suited if shoo hears tell ‘ at thy wife 's gettin ’ it . ” “ Noa , ” he said , “ aw dooant think shoo wod , but awst noan tell her ; an ’ if shoo gets to know , she mun try an ’ put up wi ’ a bit ov a trial nah an ’ then . Ther 's allus troubles for th ’ rich as weel as th ’ poor . ” Well ! all this gooas to prove what aw said at th ’ startin ’ — it 's a wonderful world , an ’ ther 's a deeal o ’ wonderful things in it ;— an ’ , to quote from the poet ( Milton aw think ) , aw may say —</p>

     </lg>
     <p>May is the month for Buttermilk ! A doctor once tell 'd me it wor worth a guinea a pint ; he sed it licked cod liver oil , castor oil ; or paraffin oil . Castor oil , he said , war varry gooid for ther bowels , cod liver oil for ther liver , an ’ paraffin oil for ther leets ( whear they 'd noa gas ) , but buttermilk wor better nor all three put together , an ’ he ad vised me to tak it . “ Why , ” aw sed ; “ what 's th ’ use o ’ . me takkin it when aw dooant ail owt ? ” “ Ther 's noa tellin ’ ha sooin yo may , ” he said , “ an ’ an it 's a varry simple remedy , yo 'd better tak it whether yo do or net . ” “ Reight enuff , ” aw sed , “ simple things sometimes do th ’ best . Aw once knew a woman ‘ at had been confined to her bed for twelve year , an ’ her husband cured her in a minit , after all th ’ doctors at th ’ infirmary had gien her up . ” Th ’ doctor pricked his ears when aw sed soa , an ’ wanted to know all abaat it , soa aw at it an ’ tell 'd him . “ Sally an ’ her husband lived at th ’ Arred Well , but he oft used to goa as far as th ’ Coit Hill ova neet to have a pint an ’ enjoy an haar or two i ’ company , an ’ when he gate haoam he used to catch it , an ’ finely too , aw con assure yo , for altho shood ligg 'd i ’ bed soa long , shoo had'nt lost th ’ use ov her tongue , an ’ her felly said ‘ at shoo had n't lost th ’ use ov her teeth nawther , for shoo could ait as weel as iver shoo could . One neet as he wor gooin hooam , he bethowt him he 'd try a bit ov a dodge on , for although he felt varry sooary for his wife , yet he could'nt help thinkin ’ it wor partly consait at shoo 'd suffer 'd throo ; soa when he gate in , shoo began a blowin ’ into him i ’ fine style . ‘ Th ’ owd time , lad ! It shows what tha cares for me ! Aw hav'nt had a wick soul to spaik to sin tha went aat , but it 's all one to thee ! Tha 'll come hooam some time an ’ find me ligg 'd deead , an ’ then tha can spree abaat throo morm to neet . ’ ‘ Nay , lass , aw dooant think aw should spree abaat any moor nor aw do nah . But who does ta think aw met to neet ? ’ he said . ‘ Ah know nowt abaat it , nor care nawther . ’ ‘ Why , but as aw war comin ’ up bith ’ Brayvet Gate , aw met Betty Earnshaw , an ’ soa aw went gaiterds wi her a bit , an ’ that 's reason aw 'm soa lat . ’ ‘ Oh ! tha mud weel be lat ! Shoo war an ’ owd sweetheart o ’ thine , wor Betty . ’ ‘ Eea , shoo war axin me ha tha wor gettin ’ on , shoo seems vany sooary for thi . ’ ‘ Sooary be hanged ! aw want nooan ov her sooarys ! If shoo could nobbut get me aat o ’ th ’ gate , shoo 'd be all reight . Did shoo ax when tha thowt tha 'd be at liberty ? ’ ‘ Nay shoo did'nt , but shoo did say at shoo thowt tha lasted long , but shoo pitied thee an ’ me . ’ ‘ Pitied thee , did shoo ! An ’ what did shoo pity thi for , aw should like to know ? Shoo happen thowt shoo could do better for thee nor what aw 've done , but if shoo wor as badly as me shood know summat . ‘ Eea , but shoo is n't , for aw nivver saw her luk better i ’ mi life , an ’ shoo talks abaat commin ’ i'th ’ morn in ’ to clean up for thi a bit ; aw sed tha 'd be fain to see her , an ’ tha sees if owt should happen thee , shadd be getten into th ’ way a bit , an ’ begin to feel moor used to th ’ haase . ’ ‘ Niver ! wol my heart 's warm , Tom . Aw 'll niver have sich a huzzy i'th ’ haase , wheal ’ aw am ! aw 'm nooan done wi yet ! aw 'll live a bit longer to plague yo wi ’ , an ’ as for cleanin ’ , aw 'll crawl abaat o ’ mi hands an ’ knees afoor shoo shall do owt for me ! Yo think aw 'm poorly an ’ soa aw 'm to be trodden on , but aw 'll let yo see awm worth a dozen deead uns yet ; nasty owd ponse as shoo is ! ” An ’ as sure as yor thear , Doctor , shoo gate up th ’ next morn in ’ an ’ kinneld th ’ fair , an ’ when Tom coom hoam to his braikfast all wor ready , an ’ shoo wor set daan at th ’ table wi a clean cap on , an ’ lukkin as smart as smart could be . When th ’ chap saw this , he said , “ Lass , aw think aw 'd better send Betty backward , ” “ Eea , aw think tha had , ” shoo sed , “ an ’ th'a can send her word throo me ‘ at aw may live to donee on her gravestooan yet . ” Tom bafs in his sleeve a bit sometimes , an ’ if iver one ov her owd fits seems likely ta come on , he 's nowt to do but say a word or two abaat Betty , an ’ shoo 's reight in a minnit . That licks buttermilk , Doctor .</p>

       <l n="1">It 's a comfort .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>It 's a comfort a chap can do withaat what he connot get . It feels hard to have to do wi ’ less nor what a body has at present , but if it has to be it will be , an ’ it 's cappin ’ ha ’ fowk manage to pool throo haiver bad th ’ job is . It 's naa use for a chap to keep longin ’ for sum mat better , unless he 's willin ’ to buckle to , an ’ work for it ; an ’ a chap wi ’ an independent mind ne'er freeats becoss he has n't all he wants ; he sets hissen to get it , an ’ if he 's detarmined he oft succeeds , an ’ if net he does n't sit daan an ’ mump , but up an ’ at it agean . Havin ’ a lot o ’ brass does n't mak a chap happy , but spend in ’ it may do , an ’ if a chap 's wise he 'll try to spend it in a way ‘ at 'll bring happiness for a long time to come . Ther 's some fowk feeared ‘ at they con niver spend brass safely ; they 're allus freeten 'd of loisin ’ it ; but they 've noa need , for if they spent it i ’ dooin ’ gooid , they 'll allus be sure o ’ gooid interest , for they 'll be pleased every time they think on it . Nah , ther 's some things i ’ this world ‘ at yo connot looise . It 's a varry easy thing to loise a cork aat ov a bottle , but it 's impossible to loise th ’ hoil aat ov a bottle neck . Yo may braik th ’ bottle all to pieces , but th ’ hoil is somewhear ; it nobbut wants another bit o ’ glass twistin ’ raand it , an ’ yo 'll find it 's as gooid as iver it wor , an ’ it 's just soa wi ’ a gooid action ; yo may loise th ’ seet on it , but it 's somewhear abaat ; it nobbut wants circumstances twistin ’ raand it , an ’ yo 'll find it 's thear — it 's niver lost . If fowk ‘ ud get into this way o ’ thinkin ’ , ther 'd be a deal moor gooid done nor ther is . Haiver mich brass a chap has , if he 's moor wants nor he con satisfy , he 's poor enuff ; an ’ aw think if fowk ‘ ud spend a bit less time i ’ tryin ’ to get rich , an ’ a bit moor i ’ tryin ’ to lessen ther wants , they 'd be moor comfortable bi th ’ hauf . But yo ’ may carry things too far even i ’ savin ’ . Aw once knew a chap ‘ at wor a regular skinflint ; he 'd gie nowt — noa , net as mich as a crumb to a burd ; an ’ if iver any wor seen abaat his haase they used to be sat daan to be young ens ‘ at had n't le'nt wit . Well , he once went to buy a seck o ’ coils , an ’ to be able to get ‘ em cheaper he fetched ‘ em throo th ’ pit ; it wor th ’ depth o ’ winter , but as he had to hug ‘ em two mile it made th ’ sweeat roll off him .. When he gate hooam he put ‘ em daan an ’ shook his heead . “ By gow , ” he sed , “ awm ommost done , but aw 'll mak ’ yo ’ pay for this , for aw will n't burn another coil this winter . ” An ’ he stuck , to his word , an ’ wheniver he wor starved , he used to get th ’ seck o ’ coils ov his back an ’ walk raand th ’ haase till he gat warm agean — an ’ he says they 're likely to fit him his bit o ’ rime aat . “ Well , ” yo'n say , “ that chap wor a fooil , ” an ’ aw think soa misen , an ’ varry likely if he 'd seen us do some things he 'd think we wor fooils . We dooant allus see things i'th ’ same leet — for instance , a pompus chap wor once tawkin ’ to me abaat his father . “ My father , ” he said , “ was a carver and gilder , an ’ he once carved a calf so naturally that you would fancy you could hear it bleat . ” “ Well , aw did n't know thi father , ” aw sed , “ but aw know thi mother once cauved one , for aw 've heeard it bleat . ” Yo ’ should just ha ’ seen him when aw sed soa !— did n't he pull th ’ blinds daan , crickey !</p>

       <l n="1">Progress .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>This is the age of progress ; and it is not slo progress nawther . The worst on it is , we 're all forced to go on whether we like it or net , for if we stand still a minit , ther 's somedy traidin ’ ov us heels , an ’ unless we move on they 'll walk ovver us , an ’ then when we see them ommost at top o'th ’ hill , we shall find us sen grubbin ’ i'th ’ muck at th ’ bottom . A chap mun have his wits abaat him at this day or else he 'll sooin ’ be left behund . Ther 's some absent minded fowk think they get on varry weel i'th ’ owd way an ’ they 're quite content , but its nobbut becoss they 're too absent minded to see ha mich better they mud ha done if they 'd wakken 'd up a bit sooiner . Aw once knew a varry absent minded chap ; he wur allus dooin ’ some sooart o ’ wrang heeaded tricks . Aw ’ remember once we 'd booath to sleep i ’ one bed , an aw gate in fust , an ’ when aw luk 'd to see if he wor commin ’ , aw 'm blow 'd ! if he had n't put his cloas into bed an hung hissen ovver th ’ cheer back . Awm sure aw connot tell where all this marchin ’ is likely to lead us to at last , but aw hooap we shall be all reight , for aw do think ther 's plenty o ’ room to mend even yet , but the deuce on it is , ’ ther 's soa monny different notions abaat what is reight wol aw 'm flamigaster 'd amang it . Some say drink is the besetting sin ; another says ‘ bacca is man 's ruination . One says we 're all goin ’ to the devil becoss we goa to church , an ’ another says we'st niver goa to heaven if we goa to th ’ chapel , but aw dooant let ony o ’ them things bother me . ‘ At ther is a deeal o ’ sin i'th ’ world aw dooant deny , an ’ , aw think ther is one ‘ at just bears th ’ same relation to other sins as a split ring bears to a bunch o ’ keys ; it 's one ‘ at all t'other things on : an ’ that 's selfishness , an we 've all sadly too mich o ’ that . We follow that “ number one ” doctrine sadly too mich ,— iverybody seems bent o ’ gettin , but ther 's varry few think o ’ givin ’ — ( unless its advice , ther 's any on ‘ em ready enuff to give that ; but if advice wor stuff ‘ at they could buy potatoes wi ’ , ther ’ wod n't be as mich o ’ that knockin ’ abaat for nowt as ther ’ is ) .</p>
     <p>We 're all varry apt to know the messur o ’ ivrybody 's heead but us own ; we can tell when a cap fits them directly , but we con niver tell when ther 's one ‘ at just fits us . Miss Parsnip said last Sunday , when shoo 'd been to th ’ chapel , “ at shoo wondered ha Mrs. Cauliflaar could fashion to hold her heead up , for shoo niver heeard a praicher hit onybody harder in all her life , ” An ’ Mrs. Cauliflaar tell 'd me “ ‘ at if shoo wor Miss Parsnip shoo 'd niver put her heead i ’ that chapel ageean , for iverybody knew ‘ at he meant her ’ when he wor tawkin ’ abaat backbitin ’ . ” An'soa it is ; we luk at other fowk 's faults through th ’ thin end o ’ th ’ spy glass , but when we want to look at us own , we turn it raand .</p>

       <l n="1">“ O , wad some power the giftie gie us</l>
       <l n="2">To see oursels as others see us ,</l>
       <l n="3">It wad fra many a blunder free us</l>

     </lg>
     <p>Selfishness may do varry weel for this world , but we should remember it is n't th gooid one does to hissen ‘ at he gets rewarded for after — it 's th ’ gooid he does to others , an ’ although we may be able to mak ’ a spreead here , wi ’ fine clooas , fine haases , an ’ sich like ; unless we put selfishness o ’ one side an ’ practise charity it 'll be noa use then .</p>

     <p>It wad be a poor shop , wad this world , if it wor n't for love ! But even love has its drawbacks . If it wor n't for love ther 'd be noa jaylussy — Shakspere calls jaylussy a green-eyed monster , an ’ it may be for owt aw know , an ’ aw dooa n't think ‘ at them ‘ at entertain it have mich white i ’ theirs . If ther 's owt aw think fooilish , it is for a husband an ’ wife to be jaylus o ’ one another ; for it spoils all ther spooart , an ’ maks a lot for other fowk ; an ’ aw 'm allus a bit suspicious abaat ‘ em , for aw 've fun it to be th ’ case ‘ at them ‘ at do reight thersens are allus th ’ last to believe owt wrang abaat others .</p>
     <p>Aw once knew a chap ‘ at wor jaylus , an ’ his wife had a sore time wi ’ him . If shoo spake to her next-door neighbor , it wor ommost as mich as her life war worth , an ’ shoo wor forced to give ovver gooin ’ to th ’ chapel , becos if shoo luk 'd at th ’ parson he used to nudge her wi ’ a hymn book . Th ’ neighbours pitied her , an ’ set him daan for a fooil ; but he gate cured at last , an ’ aw 'll tell ha . ’ Once he had to set off , an ’ as shoo wor n't varry weel he could n't tak her wi ’ him , but he gave her a lot o ’ directions afoor he went , an ’ tell 'd her ‘ at he might be back ony minit . Well , if iver ther war a miserable chap it wor Jim , wol he wor away ; but he coom back as sooin as he could , an ’ what should he see but a leet up stairs . His face went as white as chalk , an ’ he wor just creepin ’ to th ’ winder to harken , when a chap ‘ at knew him happened to pass . He knew how jaylus Jim war , soa he thowt he 'd have a lark . “ Halla , Jim ! ” he said , “ coom here ; aw 've summat to tell thee . Tha munnot goa in yor haase just nah , for tha ar'nt wanted . ”</p>
     <p>“ What ammot aw wanted for , awst like to know ? ” said Jim .</p>
     <p>“ Well , keep cooil , an ’ aw 'll tell thi . Tha knows tha 's been away a day or two , an ’ aw think it 's my duty to let thi know ‘ at last neet ther wor a young chap coom to yor haase to luk at thi mistress ; an ’ shoo 's niver been aat o ; door sin ’ , nor him nawther ; an ’ my belief is they 're in that room together just this minit . ”</p>
     <p>“ Aat o ’ my rooad ! ” sed Jim , “ let me goa in If aw dooant pitch him aat a ’ that winder , neck an ’ crop , my name is n't Jim . ” Up stairs he flew . “ Nah then , whear is he ? whear is he ? ” he haw'led , an ’ seized hold o ’ th ’ pooaker .</p>
     <p>“ Aa , Jim , ” shoo sed , “ Tha wod n't hurt th ’ child surelee ? ” an ’ shoo held up a bonny little lad abaat two days old , ‘ at stared at him as gaumless as gaumless could be , an ’ ‘ at had his father 's nooas an ’ chin to nowt .</p>

     <p>Winter 's comin ’ ! Top coits an ’ nickerbockers begin to be sowt up . A chap enjoys his bed a bit better , an ’ does n't like gettin ’ up in a mornin ’ quite as weel . Tawkin ’ abaat enjoyin ’ bed makes me think ova young chap aat o ’ Midgley at ’ gate wed an ’ browt his wife to Halifax to buy a bed , an ’ nowt wod suit her but a shut-up en , like her father an ’ mother had allus had : an ’ they wor't long befoor they fun a second-hand en , ‘ at they gate cheap , an ’ as they knew a chap ‘ at coam wi ’ a milk cart throo near whear they lived , they gate him to tak it hooam for ‘ em , an ’ it wor n't long befoor th ’ beddin ’ an ’ all wor nicely arranged , an ’ they war snoozelin ’ under th ’ blankets . They had n't been asleep long befoor he wakken 'd wi a varry uncomfortabie feelin ’ , but as his wife wor hard asleep he did n't like to disturb her . He roll 'd o ’ one side an ’ then o'th ’ tother , an ’ rub 'd his legs an ’ scratched his back , but he could n't settle do what he wod . In a bit summat made him jump straight up ov an end , an ’ if he had n't been dacently browt up , it 's very likely he mud ha ’ sed some faal words , Wi ’ him jumpin ’ up soa sudden , th ’ wife wakken 'd , an ’ jumpt up as weel , but as th ’ bed heead war abaat six inch lower nor that shoo 'd bin used to , shoo hit her neet cap agean th ’ top an ’ fell back wi a reglar sass . “ Whativer is ther to do , Sammy , ” shoo sed , as sooin as shoo could spaik , “ strike a leet ’ wi ta ! ” Sammy gate a leet , an ’ blushed an ovver his face , for it wor th ’ fust time onybody had seen him dressed that way sin he wor a little lad . “ Aw dooant know what ther is to do , ” he sed , “ but aw cannot bide i ’ that bed , an ’ that 's a fact . ” “ What ! ” shoo says , “ are ta ruein ’ o ’ thi bargain bi nah ? but tha 's no need to freat , for aw con spare thee at ony time . ” “ Nay , Jenny , ” he sed , it 's nooan thee ‘ at maks me uneasy , but aw fancy ther 's summat wick i ’ that bed besides thee an ’ me . ’ “ Is ther , ” shoo said , an ’ shoo flew off one side ; “ why whativer is it , thinks ta ? ” Sammy turned daan th ’ clooas , an ’ it just luk 'd as if sombdy had been aitin ’ spice cake an ’ letten all th ’ currans drop aat . Tawk abaat fleas ! They wor n't fleas ! they wor twice as big , an ’ they wor marchin ’ away like a rigiment o ’ sodgers . He stared wi ’ all th ’ een in his heead , an ’ shoo started a cryin ’ . “ A'a , to think ‘ at aw should iver come to this , to be walked over wi ’ a lot o ’ pouse like that ! What mun we do ? ” “ Do ! we mun catch ‘ em , aw expect , ” he sed , an ’ he began wi pickin ’ ‘ em off one bi one , an ’ droppin ’ ‘ em into some water ‘ at wor cloise by . “ Well , mi mother tell 'd me , ” he sed , “ ‘ at when fowk gate wed they began o ’ ther troubles ; an ’ it 's true an ’ all , but aw did n't expect owt like this , for if aw 'd known , aw 'd ha ’ seen th ’ weddin ’ far enough ; aw did think ‘ at a chap wad be able to get a neet 's rest anyway . ” “ Tha can goa back to thi mother , ” shoo sed , “ an ’ stop wi ’ her for owt aw care , an ’ aw wish tha 'd niver left her , for aw'st get mi deeath o ’ cold wi ’ paddlin ’ abaat wi ’ nowt on ; but does ta think tha 's catched ‘ em all ? ” “ Aw think soa , an ’ if tha 's a mind we 'll get to bed agean . ” “ Nay , tha can goa to thi mother as tha freats soa , ” shoo sed . “ Tak noa noatice o ’ what aw sed , ” sed Sammy , “ tha knows aw wor put abaat a bit , an ’ it war all for th ’ sake o ’ thee . ” “ Tha 'll tell me owt , ” shoo sed , “ put th ’ leet aat , an ’ let 's see if we con get a bit o ’ gradely sleep . ” They gate into bed once more , an ’ shoo wor off to sleep in a minit , but Sammy wor rubbin ’ an ’ scrattin ’ hissen . “ Wen , aw 've heeard tell abaat things bein ’ ball proof and bomb proof , but aw niver knew ‘ at anybody wor bug proof befoor . ” Wi ’ him knockin ’ abaat soa mich shoo wakken 'd agean . “ Nay , Sammy , ” shoo sed , “ aw 'm reight fair stawld , it 's all consait , aw 'm sure it is . ” “ Consait be hanged ! ” he bawled aat , “ just feel at that blister an ’ then tell me if it 's all consait . ” Nowt could keep awther on ‘ em ‘ i bed after that , an ’ they paraded abaat all th ’ neet like two gooasts , wait in ’ for th ’ cock crow . Mornin ’ did come at last , an ’ Sammy wor n't long befoor ’ he had th ’ bed aatside . “ What are ta baan to do wi ’ it nah ? ” ax 'd his wife . “ Aw 'm baan to leave it wheal ’ it is wol neet , ” he sed , “ an ’ if they hav n't forgetten which road they coom , aw think ther 's as monny as 'll be able to tak it back to Halifax . ” Next neet they made a bed o'th ’ floor , an ’ slept like tops , an ’ next mornin ’ when they gate up , th ’ bed wor off .

       <l n="2">This place ‘ is nearly a mile from the good old town of Halifax .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Aa ! ther wor a flare-up at Booith-Taan Hall that neet ! It had been gein aat ‘ at they 'd to be a meetin ’ held to elect a new Lord-Mayor , for New-Taan , Booith-Taan , an ’ th ’ Haley Hill , on which particular occashun , ale ud be supplied at Tuppence a pint upstairs . Ther wor a rare muster an ’ a gooid deeal o ’ argyfyin ’ tuk place abaat who shud be th ’ chearman . But one on ‘ em — a sly old fox — had kept standin ’ o ’ th ’ floor sidlin ’ abaat woll ivery other chear wor full , an ’ then after takkin a pinch o ’ snuff , he said , “ Gentlemen , aw see noa reason aw shuddent tak this place mysen , as iverybody else has getten set daan . ” Two or three ‘ at wor his friends said “ Hear , hear , ” an ’ two or three ‘ at wor n't said “ Sensashun ! ”</p>
     <p>When iverybody 's pint had getten fill 'd , he blew his nooas , tuk another pinch o ’ snuff , an ’ stud ov his hind legs to oppen th ’ proceedins . “ Bergers and Bergeresses , ” he began , “ aw 've a varry unpleasant duty to perform to-neet , which is , namely , to propooas ‘ at we have a fresh mayor , ” ( Cries ov “ Shame , ” “ Gammon , ” “ Th ’ mayor we have is ommost allus fresh ! ” ( etsetra , etsetra etsetra . ) “ Gentlemen , ” he began agean , “ what aw have to say is this , ” —</p>
     <p>“ Luk sharp an get it said , then , ” said Stander , th ’ grocer .</p>
     <p>“ If tha does n't hold thy noise , Stander , tha 'll get noa moor snuff off me , aw con tell thi that ; aw may n't be as flaary a talker as thee , but what aw say is to'th ’ point , an ’ aw think ‘ at a constituency like Booith-Taan owt to be represented by somebody ov standin ’ . ”</p>
     <p>“ Better send th ’ chearman , he 's stud den long enuft , ” said one .</p>
     <p>“ Prathi sit thi daan , if tha connot talk sense , ” said another .</p>
     <p>“ Its 's time for sombdy to stand summat , for all th ’ pints is empty , ” said th ’ lanlord .</p>
     <p>“ Well , gentlemen , ” went on th ’ chearman , “ th ’ question just dissolves itsel ’ into this : Who has it to be ? Has it to be a Doctor sombdy , or a Professor sombdy , or a Squire sombdy , or has it to be a plain Maister ? ”</p>
     <p>“ Oh I let it be a Squire , ” said one . “ E'ea , Squire Broadbent ul do , ” said another .</p>
     <p>“ Nah , lads , yo ’ ‘ Ie heeard th ’ chearman 's resolushun , an ’ aw sit daan to call upon Mr. Stander , Esquire , grocer , to address yo . ”</p>
     <p>Th ’ chearman doubled hissel ’ into th ’ shape ov his chear , an ’ after they 'd gein ovver pawsin ’ th ’ table legs , an ’ knockin ’ pint pots , Stander gate up an ’ began .</p>
     <p>“ Fellow Municipallers ( hear , hear ) , aw agree wi ’ what awr chearman says , ‘ at we owt to have sombdy o ’ standin ’ i ’ society to represent us for this subsequent year ‘ at 's forthcomin ’ . ”</p>
     <p>“ Tha happen want 's to get one o ’ thi own relations in , ” said Snittle .</p>
     <p>“ It ud seem thee better to keep thi maath shut , Snittle , till tha 's paid me for yond Garman Yeast . ” — ( Shame , shame . )</p>
     <p>“ Gentlemen , aw propooas ‘ at this meetin ’ dissolves itsel ’ into a depitation to visit Professor Holloway , to ax him if he 'll represent us for th ’ next year . Aw dooant know him mysen , but we 've all heeard tell on him , an ’ we 've seen his pills an ’ ointment advertised , an ’ aw think he 'd be a varry likely man to work awr business to th ’ best interest ov the whole communicants ; an ’ noa daat he 'd be able to heal up ony bits o ’ unpleasantness ‘ at 's been caused wi ’ this election . Aw believe him to be a varry pushin ’ man , an ’ one ov a spyring natur ; for as Elijah Barrett says ( i ’ his book on leeanin ’ to blacksmith ) , ‘ One inch the heighest , ’ seems to be the motto he works on , for goa where yo will yo 'll allus see one o ’ his bills a bit heigher nor onybody 's else , an for that reason aw beg to propooas ‘ at he should be acceptted as a fit an ’ proper person .</p>
     <p>The chearman stood up an ’ axed “ ony chap to I say owt agean that ‘ at dar . ” Up jumped Billy Bartle , an ’ said , “ Aw object to that in total ; aw see noa reason to goa to Lunnon to find a mayor , soa long as we 've professors at hooam , an aw propoosas ‘ at we ax — ” ( “ Shut up ! shut up ! ” “ Ta ’ hold , an ’ sup . ” “ Gooid lad , Billy , ” ) etsetra , etsetra . etsetra .</p>
     <p>Just then th ’ lanlord coom in an ’ turn 'd off th ’ gas , for he said “ they had n't spent aboon eighteen pence all th ’ neet . ”</p>
     <p>Th ’ chearman said he thowt they could n't do better nor all have a pinch o ’ snuff wi ’ him , an ’ have a pint i'th ’ kitchen woll they talked things ovver ; soa they went daan th ’ stairs , an ’ somha they managed to re-elect th ’ owd en afoor they went hooam , an ’ six on em hugged him o ’ ther heeads to th ’ top o ’ Ringby , an ’ niver heed if ther heeads did n't wark th ’ next mornin ’ .</p>

     <p>Candidates at an election allus reminds me ov a lot o ’ bees turned aat , for they fly abaat th ’ country buzzin ’ an ’ hummin ’ , wol yor fair capt what a din they con mak ; but as sooin as they pop into th ’ hive o ’ St. Stephen 's yo niver hear a muff — they 're as quite as waxwark . Aw varrily believe ‘ at one hauf on ‘ em niver oppen the maath throo th ’ yaar end to year end , nobbut when they 're sleepy , then they may gape a bit , but they do it as quiet as they can . As for them chaps ‘ at tawk soa mich befoor they goa , abaat passin ’ laws to give iverybody a paand a wick whether they work or laik , an ’ reducin ’ th ’ workin haars to three haars a day an ’ three days a wick : Why , its just gammon !</p>

     <p>What suits one body does n't suit another . Aw niver knew two fowk ‘ at allus thowt alike ; an ’ if yo iver heard a poor chap talkin ’ abaat somebdy ‘ ats weel off , he 's sure to say ‘ at if he 'd his brass he 'd do different throo what they do .</p>
     <p>Aw once heeard a chap say ‘ at if he 'd as mich brass as Baron Rothschild he 'd niver do owt but ait beef-steaks an ’ ride i ’ cabs . Well , lad , aw thowt , it 's better tha has n't it . We 're all varry apt to find fault wi ’ things at we know varry little abaat , an ’ happen if we knew mooar we shud say less . Aw once heeard two lasses talkin ’ , an ’ one on ‘ em war tellin ’ tother ‘ at sin shoo saw her befoor , shoo 'd getten wed , an ’ had a child , an ’ buried it . “ Why , whativer shall aw live to hear ? Aw did n't know ‘ at tha 'd begun coortin ’ . Whoiver has ta getten wed to ? ” “ Oh , awve getten wed to a forriner , at comes throo Staffordshur . ”</p>
     <p>“ Well , aw hooap , tha 's done weel , lass ; awm sure aw do . And what does he do for a livin ’ ? ” “ Why , its rayther a queer trade ; but he stails pots . ” “ Stails pots , Betty ! A'a aw wonder ha tha could bring thisen daan to wed a chap o ’ that sooart . Aw 'll keep single for iver , woll awm green maald , afoor aw 'll wed ony chap unless he gets his livin ’ honestly . ” “ Aw should like to meet ony body ‘ at says he does n't get his livin ’ honestly , ” says Betty ; “ nah thee mark that . ” “ Well , Betty , that maks noa difference to me ; but aw say agean ‘ at noa chap gets his livin ’ honestly ‘ at stails — noa matter whether he stails pots or parkins . ” “ Why , Nancy , aw thowt tha 'd moor sense , aw did for sure ;— aw mean , his trade is to put stails on to pots . ” “ Oh ! A'a ! E'e ! tha mun forgi ’ mi this time , Betty , aw see what tha meeans ; he puts hanels on to pots : that 's it , is n't it . ” “ E'ea . ” “ Why , tha sees , aw did n't understond . ” “ Ther 's monny a one has a deeal to say abaat things ‘ at they dunnot understond , an ’ monny a one gets awfully put aat wi ’ what sich like do say ; but it is n't advisable to be soa varry touchus at this day , an ’ as aw 've read somwhear —</p>

       <l n="1">Time to me this truth has towt ,</l>
       <l n="2">‘ Tis a truth ‘ at 's worth revealin ’ ;</l>
       <l n="3">Moor offend for want o ’ thowt</l>
       <l n="4">Nor for any want o ’ feelin ’ .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>An ’ aw believe that 's true ; but at th ’ same time it 's as weel to be careful net to offend onybody if we con help it , for a chap 's fingers luk a deeal nicer , an ’ moor agreeabler , when they 're oppened aat to shake hands wi yo , nor what they do when doubled up i'th ’ front o ’ yor nooas . Soa yo see , yo connot be to careful o ’ yor words an ’ deeds , if yo want to keep straight wi ’ fowk ; an ’ it 's a wise thing to be at peeace . And if this is a unsettled time o ’ th ’ year , that 's noa reason ‘ at yo should be unsettled . But as it is n't iverybody 's lot to know ha to get on smoothly , aw 'll just give yo a bit o ’ advice ; an ’ if yo learn that , an ’ act on it , yo 'll niver rue th ’ brass yo 've spent , especially if yo tak into consideration at th ’ profits are devoted to a charitable institution ( that 's awr haase ) .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>Iverybody ‘ at is owt is awther just settin ’ off or just gettin ’ back throo th ’ spaws . Ther 's nowt like th ’ sea breeze ! But a chum o ’ mine says th ’ sea breeze is a fooil to Saltaire , but he cannot mak me believe it . Ther 's nowt ever suits me as weel at Blackpool as to see a lot o ’ cheap trippers ‘ at 's just com 'd for a day — they mean to enjoy thersen . Yo can see that as sooin as iver th ’ train claps ‘ em daan , away they steer to have a luk at th ’ watter . Ther 's th ’ fayther comes th ’ furst , wi ’ th ’ youngest child in his arms , an ’ one or two rayther bigger poolin ’ ‘ at his coit laps , an ’ just behund is his owd lass , puffin ’ and blowin ’ like a steam engine , her face as red as a rising sun , an ’ a basket ov her arm big enuff for a oyster hawker . At one corner on it yo con see a black bottle neck peepin ’ aat . At th ’ side on her walks th ’ owdest lass ; an ’ is n't shoo doin ’ it grand for owt shoo knows ! Luk what fine ribbons shoo has flyin ’ daan her back , an ’ a brass ring ov her finger , varry near big enuff to mak a dog 's collar on , an ’ a cotton parasol ‘ at luks ivery bit as weel as a silk ‘ un ; and yo con see as shoo tosses her heead first to one side an then to tother , ‘ at shoo defies awther yo or onybody else to tell ‘ at shoo 's nobbut a calico wayver when shoo 's at hooam . But they get aside o'th ’ watter at last . “ Ha ! what a wopper ! ” says one o'th ’ lads , as a wave comes rollin ’ ovver . “ A'a ! but that 's a gurter ! ” says another . Then th ’ father an ’ th ’ mother puts th ’ young uns all in a row , an ’ tell ‘ em all to luk at th ’ sea — as if ther wor owt else to luk at i ’ Blackpool . But yo may see at th ’ owd lass is n't comfortable , for shoo keeps peepin ’ into her basket , an ’ at last shoo says , “ Joa — aw believe sombdy 's had ther fooit i'th ’ basket , for th ’ pasty 's brusscn , an th ’ pot wi ’ th ’ mustard in is brockken all to bits . ” “ Neer heed , if that 's all , its noa war for being mix 'd a bit ; it 's all to goa into one shop . ” As sooin as owt to ait is mentioned , th ’ childer 's hungry in a minit-even th ’ lass ’ at 's been peraidin ’ abaat an ’ could n't fashion to stand aside ov her brothers an ’ sisters coss they wor soa short o ’ manners — draws a bit nearer th ’ mother 's elbow . Daan they sit like a owd hen an ’ her chickens , an ’ dooant they put it aat o'th ’ seet ? It means nowt if th ’ mustard an ’ th ’ pickled onions have getten on th ’ apple pasty or potted mait an ’ presarved tairts squeezed all into one — they 're noan nasty nice ; an ’ then th ’ bottle 's passed raand : cold tea flavored wi rum , an sweetened , wol th ’ childer can hardly leave lawse when they 've once getten hold . An ’ wol they 're enjoyin ’ thersen this way , th ’ owd chap 's blowin ’ his bacca , an ’ tak 's a pool ivery nah and then at a little bottle , abaat th ’ size ov a prayer book , ‘ at he hugs in his side pocket . After this they mun have a sail i ’ one o'th ’ booats , an ’ in they get , tumellin ’ one over t'other , an ’ bargain wi ’ th ’ chap for a gooid haar . Th ’ owd chap pools his watch aat an mak 's sure o'th ’ time when they start , an ’ away they goa like a burd . “ Is n't it grand ? ” says furst one an ’ then another . But in a bit th ’ owd chap puts his pipe aat an ’ tak 's another pool at th ’ little bottle , an ’ his wife 's face grows a deeal leeter coloured , an ’ shoo axes him ha ’ long they 've to goa yet ? Aat comes th ’ watch , an ’ they 're capt to find ‘ at they 've nobbut been fifteen minutes , an ’ th ’ owdest lass lains ovver th ’ side , an ’ after coughin ’ a time or two begins to feed th ’ fish , an ’ th ’ little uns come to lig ther heeads o ’ ther mother 's knees , but shoo tells ‘ em to sit o'th ’ seeat , for shoo connot bide to be bothered ; then shoo tak 's a fancy to luk ovver th ’ edge , an ’ ther 's another meal for th ’ fish . Th ’ owd chap 's detarmined to stand it aat , soa he shuts his e'en , an screws up his maath wol it 's hardly as big as a thripny bit — then his watch comes aat agean , an ’ he sighs to find they 've nobbut been one hauf ther time . Th ’ chaps i'th ’ boat see ha ’ matters stand , an ’ bring ’ em back as sooin as they con . Aat they get , an ’ th ’ brass is paid withaat a word ; but th ’ owd woman shakes her heead an ’ says , “ Niver noa moor ! It 's a dear doo ! Sixpence a piece , an ’ all th ’ potted mait an ’ th ’ apple pasty wasted . ”</p>
