    <epigraph>
     <p>There are poor Mango 's poems , which James Batter and me think excellent , and if any one think otherwise , I wad just thank them to write better at their leisure . ” — Mansie Wauch “ All beneath the unrivalled rose The lowly daisy sweetly blows , Though large the forest monarch throws His army shade , Yet green the juicy hawthorne grows Adown the glade . ” — Burns To Mrs. Irving , PEMBROKE . I dedicate these verses to one whom I hold dear , One who in the dark days drew in Christian kindness near May He who led me all my life do so and more to me If ever I forget the debt of love I owe to thee .</p>

    <head>A STORY OF PLANTAGENET .</head>
    <head>In the small Village of St Joseph , below the City of Ottawa , still lives or did live very recently , an ancient couple , whole story is told in the following lines .</head>
    <lg type="part" n="1">
     <head>PART I</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="1">
      <l n="1">Lays of fair dames of lofty birth ,</l>
      <l n="2">And golden hair alt richly curled ;</l>
      <l n="3">Of knights that venture life for love ,</l>
      <l n="4">Suit poets of the older world .</l>
      <l n="5">We wilt not fill our simple rhymes ,</l>
      <l n="6">With diamond flash , or gleaming pearl ;</l>
      <l n="7">In singing of the by-gone times ;</l>
      <l n="8">We simply sing the love and faith ,</l>
      <l n="9">Outliving absence , strong as death ,</l>
      <l n="10">Of one Jow-born Canadian girl .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="11">‘ Twas long ago the rapid spring</l>
      <l n="12">Had scarce given place to summer yet ,</l>
      <l n="13">The Ottawa , with swollen flood ,</l>
      <l n="14">Rolled past thy banks , Plantagenet ;</l>
      <l n="15">Thy banks where tall and plumed pines</l>
      <l n="16">Stood rank on rank , in serried lines .</l>
      <l n="17">Green islands , each with leafy crest ,</l>
      <l n="18">Lay peaceful on the river 's breast ,</l>
      <l n="19">The trees , ere this , had , one by one ,</l>
      <l n="20">Shook out their leaflets to the sun ,</l>
      <l n="21">Forming a rustling , waving screen ,</l>
      <l n="22">While swollen waters rolled between .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="23">The wild deer trooped through woodland path ,</l>
      <l n="24">And sought the river 's strand ,</l>
      <l n="25">Slight danger then of flashing death ,</l>
      <l n="26">From roving hunter 's hand ;</l>
      <l n="27">For very seldom was there seen</l>
      <l n="28">A hunter of the doomed red race ,</l>
      <l n="29">Few spots , with miles of bush between ,</l>
      <l n="30">Marked each a settler 's dwelling-place .</l>
      <l n="31">No lumberer 's axe , no snorting scream</l>
      <l n="32">Of fierce , though trained and harnessed steam ,</l>
      <l n="33">No paddle-wheel 's revolving sound ,</l>
      <l n="34">No raftsman 's cheer , no bay of hound</l>
      <l n="35">Was heard to break the silent spell</l>
      <l n="36">That seemed to rest o'er wood and dell ,</l>
      <l n="37">All was so new , so in its prime —</l>
      <l n="38">An almost perfect solitude ,</l>
      <l n="39">As if had passed but little time</l>
      <l n="40">Since the All Father called it good .</l>
      <l n="41">Nature in one thanksgiving psalm ,</l>
      <l n="42">Gathered each sound that broke the calm .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="43">There was a little clearing there —</l>
      <l n="44">A snow white cot — a garden fair —</l>
      <l n="45">Where useful plants in order set ,</l>
      <l n="46">With bergamot and mignonette .</l>
      <l n="47">Glories that round the casement run ,</l>
      <l n="48">And pansies smiling at the sun ,</l>
      <l n="49">And wild-wood blossoms fair and sweet ,</l>
      <l n="50">Showed forth how thrift and beauty meet ;</l>
      <l n="51">There was a space to plant and sow ,</l>
      <l n="52">Fenced by the pines strong hands laid low .</l>
      <l n="53">By that lonely cottage stood ,</l>
      <l n="54">With eyes fixed on the swollen flood ,</l>
      <l n="55">A slight young girl with raven hair ,</l>
      <l n="56">And face that was both sad and fair .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="57">Oh , fair and lovely are the maids ,</l>
      <l n="58">Nursed in Canadian forest shades ;</l>
      <l n="59">The beauties of the older lands</l>
      <l n="60">Moulded anew by nature 's hands ,</l>
      <l n="61">Fired by the free Canadian soul ,</l>
      <l n="62">Join to produce a matchless whole .</l>
      <l n="63">The roses of Britannia 's Isle ,</l>
      <l n="64">In rosy blush and rosy smile ;</l>
      <l n="65">The light of true and tender eyes ,</l>
      <l n="66">As blue and pure as summer skies ;</l>
      <l n="67">Light-footed maids , as matchless fair</l>
      <l n="68">As grow by Scotia 's heath fringed rills —</l>
      <l n="69">Sweet as the hawthorn scented air ,</l>
      <l n="70">And true as the eternal hills .</l>
      <l n="71">We have the arch yet tender grace ,</l>
      <l n="72">The power to charm of Erin 's race ;</l>
      <l n="73">The peachy cheek , the rosebud mouth ,</l>
      <l n="74">Imported from the sunny south ,</l>
      <l n="75">With the dark , melting , lustrous eye ,</l>
      <l n="76">Silk lashes curtain languidly .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="6">
      <l n="77">The charms of many lands had met</l>
      <l n="78">In Marie of Plantagenet ;</l>
      <l n="79">She had the splendid southern eye</l>
      <l n="80">She had the northern brow of snow ,</l>
      <l n="81">The blush caught from a northern sky ,</l>
      <l n="82">Dark silky locks of southern flow ,</l>
      <l n="83">Light-footed as the forest roe ,</l>
      <l n="84">As stately as the mountain pine ,</l>
      <l n="85">A smile that lighted up her face ,</l>
      <l n="86">The sunshine of a maiden 's grace ,</l>
      <l n="87">And made her beauty half divine .</l>
      <l n="88">So fair of face , so fair of form</l>
      <l n="89">Was she the peerless forest born .</l>
      <l n="90">Nature is kindly to her own ,</l>
      <l n="91">To this Canadian cottage lone ,</l>
      <l n="92">A back-wood settler 's lot to bless ,</l>
      <l n="93">She brought this flower of loveliness ,</l>
      <l n="94">Seldom such beauty does she bring</l>
      <l n="95">To grace the palace of a king .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="7">
      <l n="96">A chevalier of sunny France ,</l>
      <l n="97">Whom fate ordained to wander here ,</l>
      <l n="98">To trade , to trap , to hunt the deer ,</l>
      <l n="99">To roam with free foot through the wild ,</l>
      <l n="100">He chanced , at husking , in the dance</l>
      <l n="101">To meet Marie , Le Paige 's child ,—</l>
      <l n="102">And vowed that , roaming everywhere ,</l>
      <l n="103">Except the lady fair as day ,</l>
      <l n="104">Who held his troth-plight far away ,</l>
      <l n="105">He ne'er saw face or form so fair ;</l>
      <l n="106">From France 's fair and stately queen ,</l>
      <l n="107">To maiden dancing on the green ,</l>
      <l n="108">From lowly bower to lordly hall ,</l>
      <l n="109">This forest maid outshone them all</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="8">
      <l n="110">When old Le Paige would hear this praise ,</l>
      <l n="111">Then would he turn and smiling say</l>
      <l n="112">To the plump partner of his days ,</l>
      <l n="113">“ We who know our Marie well ,</l>
      <l n="114">How true the heart so young and gay ,</l>
      <l n="115">We will not of her beauty tell .</l>
      <l n="116">Her love is more to thee and me ,</l>
      <l n="117">And yet our child is fair to see . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="9">
      <l n="118">So many a dashing hunter brave ,</l>
      <l n="119">And many an axeman of the wood ,</l>
      <l n="120">And hardy settler was her slave</l>
      <l n="121">And thought the bondage very good ;</l>
      <l n="122">But she , so kind to those she met ,</l>
      <l n="123">She smiled on all , but walked apart ,</l>
      <l n="124">Keeping the treasure of her heart ,</l>
      <l n="125">The fair Queen of Plantagenet ,</l>
      <l n="126">No thought of love her bosom stirs</l>
      <l n="127">Toward her rustic worshippers</l>
      <l n="128">Until one came and settled near</l>
      <l n="129">Famed as a hunter of the deer</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="10">
      <l n="130">The firmest hand , the truest eye ,</l>
      <l n="131">The dauntless heart and courage high</l>
      <l n="132">Where his , and famed beyond his years</l>
      <l n="133">He stood among his young compeers ,</l>
      <l n="134">He , ere the snow-wreath left the land ,</l>
      <l n="135">Slew two fierce wolves with single hand ,</l>
      <l n="136">Famished they followed on his tracks ,</l>
      <l n="137">He armed with nothing but his axe</l>
      <l n="138">He knew the river far and near ,</l>
      <l n="139">Beyond the foaming dread Chaudiere ,</l>
      <l n="140">Far far beyond that spot of fear</l>
      <l n="141">He 'd been a hardy voyageur</l>
      <l n="142">Through the white swells of many assault</l>
      <l n="143">Had safely steered his bark canoe ,</l>
      <l n="144">Knew how to pass each raging chute ,</l>
      <l n="145">Though boiling like the wild Culbute</l>
      <l n="146">The wilds of nature were his home ,</l>
      <l n="147">His paddle beat the fleecy foam</l>
      <l n="148">Of surging rapids ’ yeasty spray .</l>
      <l n="149">And bore him often far away</l>
      <l n="150">Beyond the pinefringed Allumette ,</l>
      <l n="151">He saw the sun in glory set ,</l>
      <l n="152">His boat song roused the lurking fox</l>
      <l n="153">From den beside the Oiseau rock</l>
      <l n="154">Upward upon the river 's breast ,</l>
      <l n="155">The highway to the wild Nor-west ,</l>
      <l n="156">Past the long lake Temiscamingue ,</l>
      <l n="157">Where wild drakes plume their glossy wing ,</l>
      <l n="158">Oft had he urged his light canoe ,</l>
      <l n="159">Hunting the moose and caribou ;</l>
      <l n="160">He knew each portage on the way</l>
      <l n="161">To the far posts of Hudson 's Bay ,</l>
      <l n="162">And even its frozen waters saw ,</l>
      <l n="163">When roaming courier du bois ,</l>
      <l n="164">In the great Company 's employ ,</l>
      <l n="165">Which he had entered when a boy .</l>
      <l n="166">Comely he was , and blithe , and young ,</l>
      <l n="167">Had a light heart and merry tongue ,</l>
      <l n="168">And bright dark eye , was brave and bold ,</l>
      <l n="169">Skilful to earn , and wise to hold ,</l>
      <l n="170">And so this hunter came our way ,</l>
      <l n="171">And stole our wood nymph 's heart away ;</l>
      <l n="172">And it became Belle Marie 's lot</l>
      <l n="173">To love Napoleon Rajotte</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="11">
      <l n="174">Of all the sad despairing swains ,</l>
      <l n="175">Foredoomed to disappointment 's pains ,</l>
      <l n="176">None felt the pangs of jealous woe</l>
      <l n="177">So keenly as Antome Vaiseau .</l>
      <l n="178">A thrifty settler 's only son ,</l>
      <l n="179">Who much of backwoods wealth had won ;</l>
      <l n="180">A steady lad of nature mild ,</l>
      <l n="181">Had been her playmate from a child ,</l>
      <l n="182">And saw a stranger thus come in ,</l>
      <l n="183">And take what he had died to win .</l>
      <l n="184">He saw him loved the best , the first ,</l>
      <l n="185">Still he his hopeless passion nursed .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="12">
      <l n="186">At Easter time the Cure came ,</l>
      <l n="187">And after Easter time was gone ,</l>
      <l n="188">The hunter brave , the peerless dame</l>
      <l n="189">Were blessed and made for ever one</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="13">
      <l n="190">Beside the cottage white she stood ,</l>
      <l n="191">And looked across the swelling flood —</l>
      <l n="192">Across the wave that rolled between</l>
      <l n="193">The islets robed in tender green ,</l>
      <l n="194">Watching with eager eyes , she views</l>
      <l n="195">A fleet of large well-manned canoes ,</l>
      <l n="196">The high curved bow and stern she knew ,</l>

     <l n="60">In the whole wide Dominion there is not a town</l>
     <l n="61">So loyal so lovely as this of our own</l>
     <l n="62">Broad Ottawa washes no happier place ,</l>
     <l n="63">As it lies in sweet Allumette 's tender embrace</l>
     <l n="64">Oh , to see it when autumn and sunset unite</l>
     <l n="65">To drape earth and sky with one robe of delight ,</l>
     <l n="66">When the banners of heaven in the west are unrolled ,</l>
     <l n="67">And the blue lake is barred off with purple and gold ,</l>
     <l n="68">And the Isle , like the patriarch 's favourite son ,</l>
     <l n="69">Its coat many coloured and royal has on</l>
     <l n="70">Thus fair as a vision , and sweet as a dream ,</l>
     <l n="71">It burst on the gaze of the son of our Queen ,</l>

    <head>CREED AND CONDUCT COMBINED AS CAUSE AND EFFECT .</head>
    <head>The incident related in the following lines occurred thus :— At a meeting of Presbytery appointed to deal with the case of the Reverend David Macrae , of Gourock , Scotland , one of the members of the Court had stolen out to enjoy his pipe and the quiet of his own thoughts for a few minutes before engaging in the strife of debate , when he was accosted by a stranger , woefully dilapidated , who asked him with great earnestness if he would tell him where he could see Mr. Macrae , as he was most anxious to have some conversation with him . “ Do you know , sir , ” said this poor , ruined one , “ that on the doctrine of future punishment Mr. Macrae and I are in perfect accord , and I am very desirous to tender him my cordial sympathy and support . I esteem it my duty to do what I can to comfort and cheer this young and courageous minister of the Gospel , in the cruel and unjust persecution to which he is being subjected . ”</head>

     <l n="2">Were met to consider and speak on the case</l>
     <l n="3">Of David Macrae , bent with reverend skill ,</l>
     <l n="4">On putting him through th ’ ecclesiastical mill</l>
     <l n="5">I was there , I slipped out just the plain truth to tell ,</l>

     <l n="14">We will cannily find oot the truth by and by</l>
     <l n="15">If it 's truth or a lie that lies at the root</l>
     <l n="16">Should be shown when the doctrine grows up and bears fruit</l>
     <l n="17">Thus I daundered and pondered , on lifting my e'e</l>

     <l n="21">By the cut o ’ his jib an the set o his claes</l>
     <l n="22">He was ane o thae folk wha ha e seen better days ,</l>
     <l n="23">He was verra lang legged hungry-lookup an lean ,</l>
     <l n="24">His claes werna ’ new , nor weel hained nor clean ,</l>
     <l n="25">Tight straps his short trews to meet shiny boots drew ,</l>
     <l n="26">Where wee tae an ’ big tae alike keeked through ,</l>
     <l n="27">His coat ance black braid-claith , was rusty enough ,</l>
     <l n="28">It was oot at the elbows an ’ frayed at the cuff ,</l>
     <l n="29">It was white at the seams , it was threadbare and thin</l>
     <l n="30">An ’ to hide a defects , buttoned up to the chin</l>
     <l n="31">Bruised and dinged in the crown and the brim was his hat ,</l>
     <l n="32">But set jauntily on his few hairs for a that ,</l>
     <l n="33">Paper collar an ’ cuffs showed in lieu of a shirt ,</l>
     <l n="34">As he daintily picked his way over the dirt ,</l>
     <l n="35">His face leaden and mottled with blossom that grows</l>
     <l n="36">Out of whisky , an ’ deep bottle-red was his nose ;</l>
     <l n="37">His e'en bleared an ’ bloodshot , were watery an ’ dim ,</l>
     <l n="38">Pale an ’ puffy the eyelids , an ’ red roun ’ the rim ;</l>

     <l n="46">A blessin ’ to others , a power in the land .</l>
     <l n="47">All was gone , gifts an ’ graces , the greatest , the least ,</l>
     <l n="48">Were hidden beneath the broad mark o ’ the beast —</l>
     <l n="49">Stamped on , I may say , frae the head to the feet ,</l>
     <l n="50">All lost of the man but his pride an ’ conceit ;</l>
     <l n="51">Varnished ower wi ’ the airs o ’ the shabby genteel ,</l>
     <l n="52">He was gingerly steppin ’ his way to the diel .</l>
     <l n="53">But now he is gaun to greet me on the way</l>
     <l n="54">Comin ’ forrid as ane that has something to say .</l>
     <l n="55">Takin ’ off wi ’ a flourish the bit o ’ a hat ,</l>
     <l n="56">He booed wi ’ an air maist genteel ower that ;</l>
     <l n="57">“ Excuse me , sir , stoppin ’ you thus on the way ,</l>
     <l n="58">Can you bring me to where I 'll see David Macrae ?</l>
     <l n="59">He 's a preacher that men of my culture must choose ;</l>
     <l n="60">I assure you he holds and he preaches my views ;</l>
     <l n="61">A doctrine divested of all vulgar fears ,</l>
     <l n="62">That I 've held and believed in for years upon years .</l>
     <l n="63">A doctrine most sensible , likely , and true ,</l>
     <l n="64">I endorse it , sir , as , I trust , you also do ? ”</l>
     <l n="65">I answered him , gien a bit shake to my head ,</l>
     <l n="66">As I looked at the man and considered his creed ;</l>
     <l n="67">“ You 'll see Mr. Macrae , my man , there is nae doot ,</l>
     <l n="68">If you stan ’ aboot here till they 're a ’ comin ’ oot ;</l>

     <l n="15">— My own , my beautiful , my pride ,</l>
     <l n="16">I must lament where strangers will deride ,</l>
     <l n="17">O'er thy degenerate sons whose strife and hate</l>
     <l n="18">Will make thee as a desert desolate</l>
     <l n="19">Men of gray hairs are not ashamed to strive</l>
     <l n="20">From house to house to keep the flame alive ,</l>
     <l n="21">Whispering , inventing , without rest or pause ,</l>
     <l n="22">With a “ zeal worthy of a better cause . ”</l>
     <l n="23">Drilling low agents , teaching them to fly ,</l>
     <l n="24">And spread on every fence the last new lie .</l>
     <l n="25">Oh that it were with us as in the past ,</l>
     <l n="26">And that our peace had been ordained to last</l>
     <l n="27">When kindness reigned and angry passions slept ,</l>
     <l n="28">E'er hatred 's serpent to our Eden crept ,</l>
     <l n="29">Are these the same or of a different race</l>
     <l n="30">From those who made this spot a pleasant place ,</l>
     <l n="31">When cheerful toil , mingled with praise and prayer .</l>
     <l n="32">Wealth without pride and plenty without care ,</l>
     <l n="33">When comely matrons wore the homespun suit ,</l>
     <l n="34">And mocassons encased his worship 's foot</l>
     <l n="35">No brawling then disturbed the quiet air ,</l>
     <l n="36">No drunkard 's ravings , and no swearer 's prayer</l>
     <l n="37">The godly fathers all are passed away ,</l>
     <l n="38">Gone to their rest before the evil day</l>
     <l n="39">The sons serve other gods , bow at their shrine ,</l>
     <l n="40">Of the bright dollar or the gloomy pine</l>
     <l n="41">While envy , jealousy , and low purse pride</l>
     <l n="42">Those who were loving brethren now divide ,</l>
     <l n="43">Like fabled pismires how the scrambling race ,</l>
     <l n="44">For the small honours of a country place</l>
     <l n="45">And thou , who hast a spark of nature 's fire ,</l>
     <l n="46">What are thy aims son of a godly sire ?</l>
     <l n="47">Thy good right hand , and calculating brain ,</l>
     <l n="48">Have given thee wealth with honour in its train</l>
     <l n="49">Others may strive with anxious cares and fears ,</l>
     <l n="50">Thou hast much goods laid up for many years ,</l>
     <l n="51">Wilt thou forget the line from which thou'rt sprung ?</l>
     <l n="52">Deem rich men always right and poor men wrong ?</l>
     <l n="53">Forget thy early friends and bearing free ?</l>
     <l n="54">When thou art angry have no charity ?</l>
     <l n="55">Shall wealth , not worth and vulgar pomp and show ,</l>
     <l n="56">Be the sum total of all good below ?</l>
     <l n="57">Shall we , then , cease for innate worth to scan ?</l>
     <l n="58">Look to the new made coat and not the man ?</l>
     <l n="59">Those who are raised in such an atmosphere</l>
     <l n="60">Are they who have the ever-ready sneer</l>
     <l n="61">At honest poverty , and at the road</l>
     <l n="62">To competence which their own fathers trod</l>
     <l n="63">If men of worth will stoop among the vain ,</l>
     <l n="64">We turn from them with sorrow and with pain</l>
     <l n="65">Man may repent , reform , his steps retrace ,</l>
     <l n="66">But is there renovation for a place ?</l>
     <l n="67">Will a community forego their strife ,</l>
     <l n="68">Bury the tomahawk and scalping knife ?</l>
     <l n="69">Will pride , and will self interest prevail ,</l>
     <l n="70">Where reason and where revelation fail</l>
     <l n="71">Like cause makes like effect , abroad , at home —</l>
     <l n="72">In this small township as in Greece or Rome .</l>
     <l n="73">One motto is my moral , true and sad ,</l>
     <l n="74">Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad</l>
