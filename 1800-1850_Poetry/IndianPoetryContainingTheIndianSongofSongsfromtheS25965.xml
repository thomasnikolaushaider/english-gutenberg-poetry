    <p n="2">REVERENCE TO GANESHA !</p>
    <p n="3">“ The sky is clouded ; and the wood resembles The sky , thick-arched with black Tamâla boughs ; O Radha , Radha ! take this Soul , that trembles In life 's deep midnight , to Thy golden house . ” So Nanda spoke ,— and , led by Radha 's spirit , The feet of Krishna found the road aright ; Wherefore , in bliss which all high hearts inherit , Together taste they Love 's divine delight .</p>
    <p n="4">He who wrote these things for thee , Of the Son of Wassoodee , Was the poet Jayadeva ; Him Saraswati gave ever Fancies fair his mind to throng , Like pictures palace-walls along ; Ever to his notes of love Lakshmi 's mystic dancers move . If thy spirit seeks to brood On Hari glorious , Hari good ; If it feeds on solemn numbers . Dim as dreams and soft as slumbers , Lend thine ear to Jayadev , Lord of all the spells that save . Umapatidhara 's strain Glows like roses after rain ; Sharan 's stream-like song is grand , If its tide ye understand ; Bard more wise beneath the sun Is not found than Govardhun ; Dhoyi holds the listener still With his shlokes of subtle skill ; But for sweet words suited well Jayadeva doth excel .</p>

    <head>KING SALADIN .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Long years ago — so tells Boccaccio</l>
     <l n="2">In such Italian gentleness of speech</l>
     <l n="3">As finds no echo in this northern air</l>
     <l n="4">To counterpart its music — long ago ,</l>
     <l n="5">When Saladin was Soldan of the East ,</l>
     <l n="6">The kings let cry a general crusade ;</l>
     <l n="7">And to the trysting-plains of Lombardy</l>
     <l n="8">The idle lances of the North and West</l>
     <l n="9">Rode all that spring , as all the spring runs down</l>
     <l n="10">Into a lake , from all its hanging hills ,</l>
     <l n="11">The clash and glitter of a hundred streams .</l>
     <l n="12">Whereof the rumour reached to Saladin ;</l>
     <l n="13">And that swart king — as royal in his heart</l>
     <l n="14">As any crowned champion of the Cross —</l>
     <l n="15">That he might fully , of his knowledge , learn</l>
     <l n="16">The purpose of the lords of Christendom ,</l>
     <l n="17">And when their war and what their armament ,</l>
     <l n="18">Took thought to cross the seas to Lombardy .</l>
     <l n="19">Wherefore , with wise and trustful Amirs twain ,</l>
     <l n="20">All habited in garbs that merchants use ,</l>
     <l n="21">With trader 's band and gipsire on the breasts</l>
     <l n="22">That best loved mail and dagger , Saladin</l>
     <l n="23">Set forth upon his journey perilous .</l>
     <l n="24">In that day , lordly land was Lombardy !</l>
     <l n="25">A sea of country-plenty , islanded</l>
     <l n="26">With cities rich ; nor richer one than thee ,</l>
     <l n="27">Marble Milano ! from whose gate at dawn —</l>
     <l n="28">With ear that little recked the matin-bell ,</l>
     <l n="29">But a keen eye to measure wall and foss —</l>
     <l n="30">The Soldan rode ; and all day long he rode</l>
     <l n="31">For Pavia ; passing basilic , and shrine ,</l>
     <l n="32">And gaze of vineyard-workers , wotting not</l>
     <l n="33">Yon trader was the Lord of Heathenesse .</l>
     <l n="34">All day he rode ; yet at the wane of day</l>
     <l n="35">No gleam of gate , or ramp , or rising spire ,</l>
     <l n="36">Nor Tessin 's sparkle underneath the stars</l>
     <l n="37">Promised him Pavia ; but he was ‘ ware</l>
     <l n="38">Of a gay company upon the way ,</l>
     <l n="39">Ladies and lords , with horses , hawks , and hounds :</l>
     <l n="40">Cap-plumes and tresses fluttered by the wind</l>
     <l n="41">Of merry race for home . “ Go ! ” said the king</l>
     <l n="42">To one that rode upon his better hand ,</l>
     <l n="43">“ And pray these gentles of their courtesy</l>
     <l n="44">How many leagues to Pavia , and the gates</l>
     <l n="45">What hour they close them ? ” Then the Saracen</l>
     <l n="46">Set spur , and being joined to him that seemed</l>
     <l n="47">First of the hunt , he told the message — they</l>
     <l n="48">Checking the jangling bits , and chiding down</l>
     <l n="49">The unfinished laugh to listen — but by this</l>
     <l n="50">Came up the king , his bonnet in his hand ,</l>
     <l n="51">Theirs doffed to him : “ Sir Trader , ” Torel said</l>
     <l n="52">( Messer Torello ‘ twas , of Istria ) ,</l>
     <l n="53">“ They shut the Pavian gate at even-song ,</l>
     <l n="54">And even-song is sung . ” Then turning half ,</l>
     <l n="55">Muttered , “ Pardie , the man is worshipful ,</l>
     <l n="56">A stranger too ! ” “ Fair lord ! ” quoth Saladin ,</l>
     <l n="57">“ Please you to stead some weary travellers ,</l>
     <l n="58">Saying where we may lodge , the town so far</l>
     <l n="59">And night so near ” “ Of my heart , willingly , ”</l>
     <l n="60">Made answer Torel , “ I did think but now</l>
     <l n="61">To send my knave an errand — he shall ride</l>
     <l n="62">And bring you into lodgment — oh ! no thanks ,</l>
     <l n="63">Our Lady keep you ! ” then with whispered hest</l>
     <l n="64">He called their guide and sped them . Being gone .</l>
     <l n="65">Torello told his purpose , and the band ,</l>
     <l n="66">With ready zeal and loosened bridle-chains ,</l>
     <l n="67">Rode for his hunting-palace , where they set</l>
     <l n="68">A goodly banquet underneath the planes ,</l>
     <l n="69">And hung the house with guest-lights , and anon</l>
     <l n="70">Welcomed the wondering strangers , thereto led</l>
     <l n="71">Unwitting , by a world of winding paths ;</l>
     <l n="72">Messer Torello , at the inner gate ,</l>
     <l n="73">Waiting to take them in — a goodly host ,</l>
     <l n="74">Stamped current with God 's image for a man</l>
     <l n="75">Chief among men , truthful , and just , and free .</l>
     <l n="76">Then he , “ Well met again , fair sirs ! Our knave</l>
     <l n="77">Hath found you shelter better than the worst :</l>
     <l n="78">Please you to leave your selles , and being bathed ,</l>
     <l n="79">Grace our poor supper here . ” Then Saladin ,</l>
     <l n="80">Whose sword had yielded ere his courtesy ,</l>
     <l n="81">Answered , “ Great thanks , Sir Knight , and this much blame ,</l>
     <l n="82">You spoil us for our trade ! two bonnets doffed ,</l>
     <l n="83">And travellers ’ questions holding you afield ,</l>
     <l n="84">For those you give us this . ” “ Sir ! not your meed ,</l>
     <l n="85">Nor worthy of your breeding ; but in sooth</l>
     <l n="86">That is not out of Pavia . ” Thereupon</l>
     <l n="87">He led them to fair chambers decked with all</l>
     <l n="88">Makes tired men glad ; lights , and the marble bath ,</l>
     <l n="89">And flasks that sparkled , liquid amethyst ,</l>
     <l n="90">And grapes , not dry as yet from evening dew .</l>
     <l n="91">Thereafter at the supper-board they sat ;</l>
     <l n="92">Nor lacked it , though its guest was reared a king ,</l>
     <l n="93">Worthy provend in crafts of cookery ,</l>
     <l n="94">Pastel , pasticcio — all set forth on gold ;</l>
     <l n="95">And gracious talk and pleasant courtesies ,</l>
     <l n="96">Spoken in stately Latin , cheated time</l>
     <l n="97">Till there was none but held the stranger-sir ,</l>
     <l n="98">For all his chapman 's dress of cramasie ,</l>
     <l n="99">Goodlier than silks could make him . Presently</l>
     <l n="100">Talk rose upon the Holy Sepulchre :</l>
     <l n="101">“ I go myself , ” said Torel , “ with a score</l>
     <l n="102">Of better knights — the flower of Pavia —</l>
     <l n="103">To try our steel against King Saladin 's .</l>
     <l n="104">Sirs ! ye have seen the countries of the Sun ,</l>
     <l n="105">Know you the Soldan ? ” Answer gave the king ,</l>
     <l n="106">“ The Soldan we have seen — ‘ twill push him hard</l>
     <l n="107">If , which I nothing doubt , you Pavian lords</l>
     <l n="108">Are valorous as gentle ;— we , alas !</l>
     <l n="109">Are Cyprus merchants making trade to France —</l>
     <l n="110">Dull sons of Peace . ” “ By Mary ! ” Torel cried ,</l>
     <l n="111">“ But for thy word , I ne'er heard speech so fit</l>
     <l n="112">To lead the war , nor saw a hand that sat</l>
     <l n="113">Liker a soldier 's in the sabre 's place ;</l>
     <l n="114">But sure I hold you sleepless ! ” Then himself</l>
     <l n="115">Playing the chamberlain , with torches borne ,</l>
     <l n="116">Led them to restful beds , commending them</l>
     <l n="117">To sleep and God , Who hears — Allah or God —</l>
     <l n="118">When good men do his creatures charities .</l>
     <l n="119">At dawn the cock , and neigh of saddled steeds ,</l>
     <l n="120">Broke the king 's dreams of battle — not their own ,</l>
     <l n="121">But goodly jennets from Torello 's stalls ,</l>
     <l n="122">Caparisoned to bear them ; he their host</l>
     <l n="123">Up , with a gracious radiance like the sun ,</l>
     <l n="124">To bid them speed . Beside him in the court</l>
     <l n="125">Stood Dame Adalieta ; comely she ,</l>
     <l n="126">And of her port as queenly , and serene</l>
     <l n="127">As if the braided gold about her brows</l>
     <l n="128">Had been a crown . Mutual good-morrow given ,</l>
     <l n="129">Thanks said and stayed , the lady prayed her guest</l>
     <l n="130">To take a token of his sojourn there ,</l>
     <l n="131">Marking her good-will , not his worthiness ;</l>
     <l n="132">“ A gown of miniver — these furbelows</l>
     <l n="133">Are silk I spun — my lord wears ever such —</l>
     <l n="134">A housewife 's gift ! but those ye love are far ;</l>
     <l n="135">Wear it as given for them . ” Then Saladin —</l>
     <l n="136">“ A precious gift , Madonna , past my thanks ;</l>
     <l n="137">And — but thou shalt not hear a ‘ no ’ from me —</l>
     <l n="138">Past my receiving ; yet I take it ; we</l>
     <l n="139">Were debtors to your noble courtesy</l>
     <l n="140">Out of redemption — this but bankrupts us . ”</l>
     <l n="141">“ Nay , sir ,— God shield you ! ” said the knight and dame .</l>
     <l n="142">And Saladin , with phrase of gentilesse</l>
     <l n="143">Returned , or ever that he rode alone ,</l>
     <l n="144">Swore a great oath in guttural Arabic ,</l>
     <l n="145">An oath by Allah — startling up the ears</l>
     <l n="146">Of those three Christian cattle they bestrode —</l>
     <l n="147">That never yet was princelier-natured man ,</l>
     <l n="148">Nor gentler lady ;— and that time should see</l>
     <l n="149">For a king 's lodging quittance royal repaid .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="150">It was the day of the Passaggio :</l>
     <l n="151">Ashore the war-steeds champed the burnished bit ;</l>
     <l n="152">Afloat the galleys tugged the mooring-chain :</l>
     <l n="153">The town was out ; the Lombard armourers —</l>
     <l n="154">Red-hot with riveting the helmets up ,</l>
     <l n="155">And whetting axes for the heathen heads —</l>
     <l n="156">Cooled in the crowd that filled the squares and street :</l>
     <l n="157">To speed God 's soldiers . At the none that day</l>
     <l n="158">Messer Torello to the gate came down ,</l>
     <l n="159">Leading his lady ;— sorrow 's hueless rose</l>
     <l n="160">Grew on her cheek , and thrice the destrier</l>
     <l n="161">Struck fire , impatient , from the pavement-squares ,</l>
     <l n="162">Or ere she spoke , tears in her lifted eyes ,</l>
     <l n="163">“ Goest thou , lord of mine ? ” “ Madonna , yes ! ”</l>
     <l n="164">Said Torel , “ for my soul 's weal and the Lord</l>
     <l n="165">Ride I to-day : my good name and my house</l>
     <l n="166">Reliant I intrust thee , and — because</l>
     <l n="167">It may be they shall slay me , and because ,</l>
     <l n="168">Being so young , so fair , and so reputed ,</l>
     <l n="169">The noblest will entreat thee — wait for me ,</l>
     <l n="170">Widow or wife , a year , and month , and day ;</l>
     <l n="171">Then if thy kinsmen press thee to a choice ,</l>
     <l n="172">And if I be not come , hold me for dead ;</l>
     <l n="173">Nor link thy blooming beauty with the grave</l>
     <l n="174">Against thine heart . ” “ Good my lord ! ” answered she ,</l>
     <l n="175">“ Hardly my heart sustains to let thee go ;</l>
     <l n="176">Thy memory it can keep , and keep it will ,</l>
     <l n="177">Though my one lord , Torel of Istria ,</l>
     <l n="178">Live , or —— ” “ Sweet , comfort thee ! San Pietro speed !</l>
     <l n="179">I shall come home : if not , and worthy knees</l>
     <l n="180">Bend for this hand , whereof none worthy lives ,</l>
     <l n="181">Least he who lays his last kiss thus upon it ,</l>
     <l n="182">Look thee , I free it —— ” “ Nay ! ” she said , “ but I ,</l>
     <l n="183">A petulant slave that hugs her golden chain ,</l>
     <l n="184">Give that gift back , and with it this poor ring :</l>
     <l n="185">Set it upon thy sword-hand , and in fight</l>
     <l n="186">Be merciful and win , thinking of me . ”</l>
     <l n="187">Then she , with pretty action , drawing on</l>
     <l n="188">Her ruby , buckled over it his glove —</l>
     <l n="189">The great steel glove — and through the helmet bars</l>
     <l n="190">Took her last kiss ;— then let the chafing steed</l>
     <l n="191">Have its hot will and go .</l>
     <l n="192">But Saladin ,</l>
     <l n="193">Safe back among his lords at Lebanon ,</l>
     <l n="194">Well wotting of their quest , awaited it ,</l>
     <l n="195">And held the Crescent up against the Cross ,</l>
     <l n="196">In many a doughty fight Ferrara blades</l>
     <l n="197">Clashed with keen Damasc , many a weary month</l>
     <l n="198">Wasted afield ; but yet the Christians</l>
     <l n="199">Won nothing nearer to Christ 's sepulchre ;</l>
     <l n="200">Nay , but gave ground . At last , in Acre pent ,</l>
     <l n="201">On their loose files , enfeebled by the war ,</l>
     <l n="202">Came stronger smiter than the Saracen —</l>
     <l n="203">The deadly Pest : day after day they died ,</l>
     <l n="204">Pikeman and knight-at-arms ; day after day</l>
     <l n="205">A thinner line upon the leaguered wall</l>
     <l n="206">Held off the heathen :— held them off a space ;</l>
     <l n="207">Then , over-weakened , yielded , and gave up</l>
     <l n="208">The city and the stricken garrison .</l>
     <l n="209">So to sad chains and hateful servitude</l>
     <l n="210">Fell all those purple lords — Christendom 's stars ,</l>
     <l n="211">Once high in hope as soaring Lucifer ,</l>
     <l n="212">Now low as sinking Hesper : with them fell</l>
     <l n="213">Messer Torello — never one so poor</l>
     <l n="214">Of all the hundreds that his bounty fed</l>
     <l n="215">As he in prison — ill-entreated , bound ,</l>
     <l n="216">Starved of sweet light , and set to shameful tasks ;</l>
     <l n="217">And that great load at heart to know the days</l>
     <l n="218">Fast flying , and to live accounted dead .</l>
     <l n="219">One joy his gaolers left him ,— his good hawk ;</l>
     <l n="220">The brave , gay bird that crossed the seas with him :</l>
     <l n="221">And often , in the mindful hour of eve ,</l>
     <l n="222">With tameless eye and spirit masterful ,</l>
     <l n="223">In a feigned anger checking at his hand ,</l>
     <l n="224">The good gray falcon made his master cheer .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="225">One day it chanced Saladin rode afield</l>
     <l n="226">With shawled and turbaned Amirs , and his hawks —</l>
     <l n="227">Lebanon-bred , and mewed as princes lodge —</l>
     <l n="228">Flew foul , forgot their feather , hung at wrist ,</l>
     <l n="229">And slighted call . The Soldan , quick in wrath ,</l>
     <l n="230">Bade slay the cravens , scourge the falconer ,</l>
     <l n="231">And seek some wight who knew the heart of hawks ,</l>
     <l n="232">To keep it hot and true . Then spake a Sheikh —</l>
     <l n="233">“ There is a Frank in prison by the sea ,</l>
     <l n="234">Far-seen herein . ” “ Give word that he be brought , ”</l>
     <l n="235">Quoth Saladin , “ and bid him set a cast :</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="237">Thus by the winding path of circumstance</l>
     <l n="238">One palace held , as prisoner and prince ,</l>

     <l n="240">Nay and unwitting , though they met and spake</l>
     <l n="241">Of that goshawk and this — signors in serge ,</l>

     <l n="243">Some trick of face , the manner of some smile ,</l>
     <l n="244">Some gleam of sunset from the glad day gone ,</l>
     <l n="245">Caught the king 's eye , and held it . “ Nazarene !</l>

     <l n="249">Now best uncalled . ” “ Come hither , Christian ! ”</l>
     <l n="250">The Soldan said , and led the way , by court</l>
     <l n="251">And hall and fountain , to an inner room</l>
     <l n="252">Rich with king 's robes : therefrom he reached a gown ,</l>
     <l n="253">And “ Know'st thou this ? ” he asked . “ High lord ! I might</l>
     <l n="254">Elsewhere , ” quoth Torel , “ here ‘ twere mad to say</l>
     <l n="255">Yon gown my wife unto a trader gave</l>
     <l n="256">Who shared our board . ” “ Nay , but that gown is this ,</l>
     <l n="257">And she the giver , and the trader I , ”</l>
     <l n="258">Quoth Saladin ; “ I ! twice a king to-day ,</l>
     <l n="259">Owing a royal debt and paying it . ”</l>
     <l n="260">Then Torel , sore amazed , “ Great lord , I blush ,</l>
     <l n="261">Remembering how the Master of the East</l>
     <l n="262">Lodged sorrily . ” “ It 's Master 's Master thou ! ”</l>
     <l n="263">Gave answer Saladin , “ come in and see</l>
     <l n="264">What wares the Cyprus traders keep at home ;</l>
     <l n="265">Come forth and take thy place , Saladin 's friend , ”</l>
     <l n="266">Therewith into the circle of his lords ,</l>
     <l n="267">With gracious mien the Soldan led his slave ;</l>
     <l n="268">And while the dark eyes glittered , seated him</l>
     <l n="269">First of the full divan . “ Orient lords , ”</l>
     <l n="270">So spake he ,— “ let the one who loves his king</l>
     <l n="271">Honour this Frank , whose house sheltered your king ;</l>
     <l n="272">He is my brother : ” then the night-black beards</l>
     <l n="273">Swept the stone floor in ready reverence ,</l>
     <l n="274">Agas and Amirs welcoming Torel :</l>
     <l n="275">And a great feast was set , the Soldan 's friend</l>
     <l n="276">Royally garbed , upon the Soldan 's hand ,</l>
     <l n="277">Shining the bright star of the banqueters .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="278">All which , and the abounding grace and love</l>
     <l n="279">Shown him by Saladin , a little held</l>
     <l n="280">The heart of Torel from its Lombard home</l>
     <l n="281">With Dame Adalieta : but it chanced</l>
     <l n="282">He sat beside the king in audience ,</l>
     <l n="283">And there came one who said , “ Oh , Lord of lords ,</l>
     <l n="284">That galley of the Genovese which sailed</l>
     <l n="285">With Frankish prisoners is gone down at sea . ”</l>
     <l n="286">“ Gone down ! ” cried Torel . “ Ay ! what recks it , friend ,</l>
     <l n="287">To fall thy visage for ? ” quoth Saladin ;</l>
     <l n="288">“ One galley less to ship-stuffed Genoa ! ”</l>
     <l n="289">“ Good my liege ! ” Torel said , “ it bore a scroll</l>
     <l n="290">Inscribed to Pavia , saying that I lived ;</l>
     <l n="291">For in a year , a month , and day , not come ,</l>
     <l n="292">I bade them hold me dead ; and dead I am ,</l>
     <l n="293">Albeit living , if my lady wed ,</l>
     <l n="294">Perchance constrained . ” “ Certes , ” spake Saladin ,</l>
     <l n="295">“ A noble dame — the like not won , once lost —</l>
     <l n="296">How many days remain ? ” “ Ten days , my prince ,</l>
     <l n="297">And twelvescore leagues between my heart and me :</l>
     <l n="298">Alas ! how to be passed ? ” Then Saladin —</l>
     <l n="299">“ Lo ! I am loath to lose thee — wilt thou swear</l>
     <l n="300">To come again if all go well with thee ,</l>
     <l n="301">Or come ill speeding ? ” “ Yea , I swear , my king ,</l>
     <l n="302">Out of true love , ” quoth Torel , “ heartfully . ”</l>
     <l n="303">Then Saladin , “ Take here my signet-seal ;</l>
     <l n="304">My admiral will loose his swiftest sail</l>
     <l n="305">Upon its sight ; and cleave the seas , and go</l>
     <l n="306">And clip thy dame , and say the Trader sends</l>
     <l n="307">A gift , remindful of her courtesies . ”</l>
     <l n="308">Passed were the year , and month , and day ; and passed</l>
     <l n="309">Out of all hearts but one Sir Torel 's name ,</l>
     <l n="310">Long given for dead by ransomed Pavians :</l>
     <l n="311">For Pavia , thoughtless of her Eastern graves ,</l>
     <l n="312">A lovely widow , much too gay for grief ,</l>
     <l n="313">Made peals from half a hundred campaniles</l>
     <l n="314">To ring a wedding in . The seven bells</l>
     <l n="315">Of Santo Pietro , from the nones to noon ,</l>
     <l n="316">Boomed with bronze throats the happy tidings out ;</l>
     <l n="317">Till the great tenor , overswelled with sound ,</l>
     <l n="318">Cracked itself dumb . Thereat the sacristan ,</l>
     <l n="319">Leading his swinkèd ringers down the stairs ,</l>
     <l n="320">Came blinking into sunlight — all his keys</l>
     <l n="321">Jingling their little peal about his belt —</l>
     <l n="322">Whom , as he tarried , locking up the porch ,</l>
     <l n="323">A foreign signor , browned with southern suns ,</l>
     <l n="324">Turbaned and slippered , as the Muslims use ,</l>
     <l n="325">Plucked by the cope . “ Friend , ” quoth he — ‘ twas a tongue</l>
     <l n="326">Italian true , but in a Muslim mouth —</l>
     <l n="327">“ Why are your belfries busy — is it peace</l>
     <l n="328">Or victory , that so ye din the ears</l>
     <l n="329">Of Pavian lieges ? ” “ Truly , no liege thou ! ”</l>
     <l n="330">Grunted the sacristan , “ who knowest not</l>
     <l n="331">That Dame Adalieta weds to-night</l>
     <l n="332">Her fore-betrothed ,— Sir Torel 's widow she ,</l>
     <l n="333">That died i ’ the chain ? ” “ To-night ! ” the stranger said</l>
     <l n="334">“ Ay , sir , to-night !— why not to-night ?— to-night !</l>
     <l n="335">And you shall see a goodly Christian feast</l>
     <l n="336">If so you pass their gates at even-song ,</l>
     <l n="337">For all are asked . ”</l>
     <l n="338">No more the questioner ,</l>
     <l n="339">But folded o'er his face the Eastern hood ,</l>
     <l n="340">Lest idle eyes should mark how idle words</l>
     <l n="341">Had struck him home . “ So quite forgot !— so soon !—</l>
     <l n="342">And this the square wherein I gave the joust ,</l>
     <l n="343">And that the loggia , where I fed the poor ;</l>
     <l n="344">And yon my palace , where — oh , fair ! oh , false !—</l>
     <l n="345">They robe her for a bridal . Can it be ?</l>
     <l n="346">Clean out of heart , with twice six flying moons ,</l>
     <l n="347">The heart that beat on mine as it would break ,</l>
     <l n="348">That faltered forty oaths . Forced ! forced !— not false —</l>
     <l n="349">Well ! I will sit , wife , at thy wedding-feast ,</l>
     <l n="350">And let mine eyes give my fond faith the lie . ”</l>
     <l n="351">So in the stream of gallant guests that flowed</l>
     <l n="352">Feastward at eve , went Torel ; passed with them</l>
     <l n="353">The outer gates , crossed the great courts with them ,</l>
     <l n="354">A stranger in the walls that called him lord .</l>
     <l n="355">Cressets and coloured lamps made the way bright ,</l>
     <l n="356">And rose-leaves strewed to where within the doors</l>
     <l n="357">The master of the feast , the bridegroom , stood ,</l>
     <l n="358">A-glitter from his forehead to his foot ,</l>
     <l n="359">Speaking fair welcomes . He , a courtly lord ,</l>
     <l n="360">Marking the Eastern guest , bespoke him sweet ,</l>
     <l n="361">Prayed place for him , and bade them set his seat</l>
     <l n="362">Upon the dais . Then the feast began ,</l>
     <l n="363">And wine went free as wit , and music died —</l>
     <l n="364">Outdone by merrier laughter .— only one</l>
     <l n="365">Nor ate nor drank , nor spoke nor smiled ; but gazed</l>
     <l n="366">On the pale bride , pale as her crown of pearls ,</l>
     <l n="367">Who sate so cold and still , and sad of cheer ,</l>
     <l n="368">At the bride-feast .</l>
     <l n="369">But of a truth , Torel</l>
     <l n="370">Read the thoughts right that held her eyelids down ,</l>
     <l n="371">And knew her loyal to her memories .</l>
     <l n="372">Then to a little page who bore the wine ,</l>
     <l n="373">He spake , “ Go tell thy lady thus from me :</l>
     <l n="374">In mine own land , if any stranger sit</l>
     <l n="375">A wedding-guest , the bride , out of her grace ,</l>
     <l n="376">In token that she knows her guest 's good-will ,</l>
     <l n="377">In token she repays it , brims a cup ,</l>
     <l n="378">Wherefrom he drinking she in turn doth drink ;</l>
     <l n="379">So is our use . ” The little page made speed</l>
     <l n="380">And told the message . Then that lady pale —</l>
     <l n="381">Ever a gentle and a courteous heart —</l>
     <l n="382">Lifted her troubled eyes and smiled consent</l>
     <l n="383">On the swart stranger . By her side , untouched ,</l>
     <l n="384">Stood the brimmed gold ; “ Bear this , ” she said , “ and pray</l>
     <l n="385">He hold a Christian lady apt to learn</l>
     <l n="386">A kindly lesson . ” But Sir Torel loosed</l>
     <l n="387">From off his finger — never loosed before —</l>
     <l n="388">The ring she gave him on the parting day ;</l>
     <l n="389">And ere he drank , behind his veil of beard</l>
     <l n="390">Dropped in the cup the ruby , quaffed , and sent .—</l>
     <l n="391">Then she , with sad smile , set her lips to drink ,</l>
     <l n="392">And — something in the Cyprus touching them ,</l>
     <l n="393">Glanced — gazed — the ring !— her ring !— Jove ! how she eyes</l>
     <l n="394">The wistful eyes of Torel !— how , heartsure ,</l>
     <l n="395">Under all guise knowing her lord returned ,</l>
     <l n="396">She springs to meet him coming !— telling all</l>
     <l n="397">In one great cry of joy .</l>
     <l n="398">O me ! the rout ,</l>
     <l n="399">The storm of questions ! stilled , when Torel spake</l>
     <l n="400">His name , and , known of all , claimed the Bride Wife ,</l>
     <l n="401">Maugre the wasted feast , and woful groom .</l>
     <l n="402">All hearts but his were light to see Torel ;</l>
     <l n="403">But Adalieta 's lightest , as she plucked</l>
     <l n="404">The bridal-veil away . Something therein —</l>
     <l n="405">A lady 's dagger — small , and bright , and fine —</l>
     <l n="406">Clashed out upon the marble . “ Wherefore that ? ”</l>
     <l n="407">Asked Torel ; answered she , “ I knew you true ;</l>
     <l n="408">And I could live , so long as I might wait ;</l>
     <l n="409">But they — they pressed me hard ! my days of grace</l>
     <l n="410">Ended to-night — and I had ended too ,</l>
     <l n="411">Faithful to death , if so thou hadst not come . ”</l>

    <p>TWO BOOKS FROM THE ILIAD OF INDIA .</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="81">( Now for the first time translated . )</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>There exist certain colossal , unparalleled , epic poems in the sacred language of India , which were not known to Europe , even by name , till Sir William Jones announced their existence ; and which , since his time , have been made public only by fragments — by mere specimens — bearing to those vast treasures of Sanskrit literature such small proportion as cabinet samples of ore have to the riches of a mine . Yet these twain mighty poems contain all the history of ancient India , so far as it can be recovered , together with such inexhaustible details of its political , social , and religious life that the antique Hindu world really stands epitomised in them . The Old Testament is not more interwoven with the Jewish race , nor the New Testament with the civilisation of Christendom , nor the Koran with the records and destinies of Islam , than are these two Sanskrit poems — the Mahábhárata and Rámáyana — with that unchanging and teeming population which Her Majesty , Queen Victoria , rules as Empress of Hindustan . The stories , songs , and ballads , the histories and genealogies , the nursery tales and religious discourses , the art , the learning , the philosophy , the creeds , the moralities , the modes of thought ; the very phrases , sayings , turns of expression , and daily ideas of the Hindu people , are taken from these poems . Their children and their wives are named out of them ; so are their cities , temples , streets , and cattle . They have constituted the library , the newspaper , and the Bible — generation after generation — to all the succeeding and countless millions of Indian people ; and it replaces patriotism with that race and stands in stead of nationality to possess these two precious and inexhaustible books , and to drink from them as from mighty and overflowing rivers . The value ascribed in Hindustan to these yet little-known epics has transcended all literary standards established in the West . They are personified , worshipped , and cited from as something divine . To read or even listen to them is thought by the devout Hindu sufficiently meritorious to bring prosperity to his household here and happiness in the next world ; they are held also to give wealth to the poor , health to the sick , wisdom to the ignorant ; and the recitation of certain parvas and shlokas in them can fill the household of the barren , it is believed , with children . A concluding passage of the great poem says :—</p>
   <p>“ The reading of this Mahábhárata destroys all sin and produces virtue ; so much so , that the pronunciation of a single shloka is sufficient to wipe away much guilt . This Mahábhárata contains the history of the gods , of the Rishis in heaven and those on earth , of the Gandharvas and the Rákshasas . It also contains the life and actions of the one God , holy , immutable , and true ,— who is Krishna , who is the creator and the ruler of this universe ; who is seeking the welfare of his creation by means of his incomparable and indestructible power ; whose actions are celebrated by all sages ; who has bound human beings in a chain , of which one end is life and the other death ; on whom the Rishis meditate , and a knowledge of whom imparts unalloyed happiness to their hearts , and for whose gratification and favour all the daily devotions are performed by all worshippers . If a man reads the Mahábhárata and has faith in its doctrines , he is free from all sin , and ascends to heaven after his death . ”</p>
   <p>In order to explain the portion of this Indian epic , here for the first time published in English verse , I reprint a brief summary of its plot :—</p>
   <p>The “ great war of Bhârat ” has its first scenes in Hastinapur , an ancient and vanished city , formerly situated about sixty miles north-east of the modern Delhi . The Ganges has washed away even the ruins of this the metropolis of King Bhârat 's dominions . The poem opens with a “ sacrifice of snakes , ” but this is a prelude , connected merely by a curious legend with the real beginning . That beginning is reached when the five sons of “ King Pandu the Pale ” and the five sons of “ King Dhritarashtra the Blind , ” both of them descendants of Bhârat , are being brought up together in the palace . The first were called Pandavas , the last Kauravas , and their lifelong feud is the main subject of the epic . Yudhishthira , Bhíma , Arjuna , Nakula , and Sahadeva are the Pandava princes . Duryodhana is chief of the Kauravas . They are instructed by one master , Drona , a Brahman , in the arts of war and peace , and learn to manage and brand cattle , hunt wild animals , and tame horses . There is in the early portion a striking picture of an Aryan tournament , wherein the young cousins display their skill , “ highly arrayed , amid vast crowds , ” and Arjuna especially distinguishes himself . Clad in golden mail , he shows amazing feats with sword and bow . He shoots twenty-one arrows into the hollow of a buffalo-horn while his chariot whirls along ; he throws the “ chakra , ” or sharp quoit , without once missing his victim ; and , after winning the prizes , kneels respectfully at the feet of his instructor to receive his crown . The cousins , after this , march out to fight with a neighbouring king , and the Pandavas , who are always the favoured family in the poem , win most of the credit , so that Yudhishthira is elected from among them Yuvaraj , or heir apparent . This incenses Duryodhana , who , by appealing to his father , Dhritarashtra , procures a division of the kingdom , the Pandavas being sent to Vacanavat , now Allahabad . All this part of the story refers obviously to the advances gradually made by the Aryan conquerors of India into the jungles peopled by aborigines . Forced to quit their new city , the Pandavas hear of the marvellous beauty of Draupadí , whose Swayamvara , or “ choice of a suitor , ” is about to be celebrated at Kâmpilya . This again furnishes a strange and glittering picture of the old times ; vast masses of holiday people , with rajahs , elephants , troops , jugglers , dancing-women , and showmen , are gathered in a gay encampment round the pavilion of the King Draupada , whose lovely daughter is to take for her husband ( on the well-understood condition that she approves of him ) the fortunate archer who can strike the eye of a golden fish , whirling round upon the top of a tall pole , with an arrow shot from an enormously strong bow . The princess , adorned with radiant gems , holds a garland of flowers in her hand for the victorious suitor ; but none of the rajahs can bend the bow . Arjuna , disguised as a Brahman , performs the feat with ease , and his youth and grace win the heart of Draupadí more completely than his skill . The princess henceforth follows the fortunes of the brothers , and , by a strange ancient custom , lives with them in common . The Pandavas , now allied to the King Draupada and become strong , are so much dreaded by the Kauravas that they are invited back again , for safety 's sake , to Hastinapura , and settle near it in the city of Indraprastha , now Delhi . The reign of Yudhishthira and his brothers is very prosperous there ; “ every subject was pious ; there were no liars , thieves , or cheats ; no droughts , floods , or locusts ; no conflagrations nor invaders , nor parrots to eat up the grain . ”</p>
   <p>The Pandava king , having subdued all enemies , now performs the Rajasuya , or ceremony of supremacy ,— and here again occur wonderfully interesting pictures . Duryodhana comes thither , and his jealousy is inflamed by the magnificence of the rite . Among other curious incidents is one which seems to show that glass was already known . A pavilion is paved with “ black crystal , ” which the Kaurava prince mistakes for water , and “ draws up his garments lest he should be wetted . ” But now approaches a turning-point in the epic . Furious at the wealth and fortune of his cousins , Duryodhana invites them to Hastinapura to join in a great gambling festival . The passion for play was as strong apparently with these antique Hindus as that for fighting or for love : “ No true Kshatriya must ever decline a challenge to combat or to dice . ” The brothers go to the entertainment , which is to ruin their prosperity ; for Sakuni , the most skilful and lucky gambler , has loaded the “ coupun , ” so as to win every throw . Mr. Wheeler 's excellent summary again says :—</p>
   <p>“ Then Yudhishthira and Sakuni sat down to play , and whatever Yudhishthira laid as stakes Duryodhana laid something of equal value ; but Yudhishthira lost every game . He first lost a very beautiful pearl ; next a thousand bags each containing a thousand pieces of gold ; next a great piece of gold so pure that it was as soft as wax ; next a chariot set with jewels and hung all round with golden bells ; next a thousand war-elephants with golden howdahs set with diamonds ; next a lakh of slaves all dressed in rich garments ; next a lakh of beautiful slave-girls , adorned from head to foot with golden ornaments ; next all the remainder of his goods ; next all his cattle ; and then the whole of his Râj , excepting only the lands which had been granted to the Brahmans . ”</p>
   <p>After this tremendous run of ill-luck , he madly stakes Draupadí the Beautiful , and loses her . The princess is dragged away by the hair , and Duryodhana mockingly bids her come and sit upon his knee , for which Bhíma the Pandava swears that he will some day break his thigh-bone ,— a vow which is duly kept . But the blind old king rebukes this fierce elation of the winner , restores Draupadí , and declares that they must throw another main to decide who shall leave Hastinapura . The cheating Sakuni cogs the dice again , and the Pandavas must now go away into the forest , and let no man know them by name for thirteen years . They depart , Draupadí unbinding her long black hair , and vowing never to fasten it back again till the hands of Bhíma , the strong man among the Pandavas , are red with the punishment of the Kauravas . “ Then he shall tie my tresses up again , when his fingers are dripping with Duhsasana 's blood . ”</p>
   <p>There follow long episodes of their adventures in the jungle till the time when the Pandavas emerge , and , still disguised , take up their residence in King Viráta 's city . Here the vicissitudes of Draupadí as a handmaid of the queen , of Bhíma as the palace wrestler , of Arjuna disguised as a eunuch , and of Nakula , Sahadeva , and Yudhishthira , acting as herdsmen and attendants , are most absorbing and dramatic . The virtue of Draupadí , assailed by a prince of the State , is terribly defended by the giant Bhíma ; and when the Kauravas , suspecting the presence in the place of their cousins , attack Viráta , Arjuna drives the chariot of the heir apparent , and victoriously repulses them with his awful bow Gandiva .</p>
   <p>After all these evidences of prowess and the help afforded in the battle , the King of Viráta discovers the princely rank of the Pandavas , and gives his daughter in marriage to the son of Arjuna . A great council is then held to consider the question of declaring war on the Kauravas , at which the speeches are quite Homeric , the god Krishna taking part . The decision is to prepare for war , but to send an embassy first . Meantime Duryodhana and Arjuna engage in a singular contest to obtain the aid of Krishna , whom both of them seek out . This celestial hero is asleep when they arrive , and the proud Kaurava , as Lord of Indraprastha , sits down at his head ; Arjuna , more reverently , takes a place at his feet . Krishna , awaking , offers to give his vast army to one of them , and himself as counsellor to the other ; and Arjuna gladly allows Duryodhana to take the army , which turns out much the worse bargain . The embassy , meantime , is badly received ; but it is determined to reply by a counter-message , while warlike preparations continue . There is a great deal of useless negotiation , against which Draupadí protests , like another Constance , saying , “ War , war ! no peace ! Peace is to me a war ! ” Krishna consoles her with the words , “ Weep not ! the time has nearly come when the Kauravas will be slain , both great and small , and their wives will mourn as you have been mourning . ” The ferocity of the chief of the Kauravas prevails over the wise counsels of the blind old king and the warnings of Krishna , so that the fatal conflict must now begin upon the plain of Kurukshetra .</p>
   <p>All is henceforth martial and stormy in the “ parvas ” that ensue . The two enormous hosts march to the field , generalissimos are selected , and defiances of the most violent and abusive sort exchanged . Yet there are traces of a singular civilisation in the rules which the leaders draw up to be observed in the war . Thus , no stratagems are to be used ; the fighting men are to fraternise , if they will , after each combat ; none may slay the flier , the unarmed , the charioteer , or the beater of the drum ; horsemen are not to attack footmen , and nobody is to fling a spear till the preliminary challenges are finished ; nor may any third man interfere when two combatants are engaged . These curious regulations — which would certainly much embarrass Von Moltke — are , sooth to say , not very strictly observed , and , no doubt , were inserted at a later age in the body of the poem by its Brahman editors . Those same interpolaters have overloaded the account of the eighteen days of terrific battle which follow with many episodes and interruptions , some very eloquent and philosophic ; indeed , the whole Bhagavad-Gîta comes in hereabouts as a religious interlude . Essays on laws , morals , and the sciences are grafted , with lavish indifference to the continuous flow of the narrative , upon its most important portions ; but there is enough of solid and tremendous fighting , notwithstanding , to pale the crimson pages of the Greek Iliad itself . The field glitters , indeed , with kings and princes in panoply of gold and jewels , who engage in mighty and varied combats , till the earth swims in blood , and the heavens themselves are obscured with dust and flying weapons . One by one the Kaurava chiefs are slain , and Bhíma , the giant , at last meets in arms Duhsasana , the Kaurava prince who had dragged Draupadí by the hair . He strikes him down with the terrible mace of iron , after which he cuts off his head , and drinks of his blood , saying , “ Never have I tasted a draught so delicious as this . ” So furious now becomes the war that even the just and mild Arjuna commits two breaches of Aryan chivalry ,— killing an enemy while engaged with a third man , and shooting Karna dead while he is extricating his chariot-wheel and without a weapon . At last none are left of the chief Kauravas except Duryodhana , who retires from the field and hides in an island of the lake . The Pandavas find him out , and heap such reproaches on him that the surly warrior comes forth at length , and agrees to fight with Bhíma . The duel proves of a tremendous nature , and is decided by an act of treachery ; for Arjuna , standing by , reminds Bhíma , by a gesture , of his oath to break the thigh of Duryodhana , because he had bidden Draupadí sit on his knee . The giant takes the hint , and strikes a foul blow , which cripples the Kaurava hero , and he falls helpless to earth . After this the Pandava princes are declared victorious , and Yudhishthira is proclaimed king .</p>
   <p>The great poem soon softens its martial music into a pathetic strain . The dead have to be burned , and the living reconciled to their new lords ; while afterwards King Yudhishthira is installed in high state with “ chámaras , golden umbrellas , elephants , and singing . ” He is enthroned facing towards the east , and touches rice , flowers , earth , gold , silver , and jewels , in token of owning all the products of his realm . Being thus firmly seated on his throne , with his cousins round him , the Rajah prepares to celebrate the most magnificent of ancient Hindu rites ,— the Aswamedha , or Sacrifice of the Horse . It is difficult to raise the thoughts of a modern and Western public to the solemnity , majesty , and marvel of this antique Oriental rite , as viewed by Hindus . The monarch who was powerful enough to perform it chose a horse of pure white colour , “ like the moon , ” with a saffron tail , and a black right ear ; or the animal might be all black , without a speck of colour . This steed , wearing a gold plate on its forehead , with the royal name inscribed , was turned loose , and during a whole year the king 's army was bound to follow its wanderings . Whithersoever it went , the ruler of the invaded territory must either pay homage to the king , and join him with his warriors , or accept battle ; but whether conquered or peacefully submitting , all these princes must follow the horse , and at the end of the year assist at the sacrifice of the consecrated animal . Moreover , during the whole year the king must restrain all passion , live a perfectly purified life , and sleep on the bare ground . The white horse could not be loosened until the night of the full moon in Chaitra , which answers to the latter half of March and the first half of April ,— in fact , at Easter-time ; and it may be observed here that this is not the only strange coincidence in the sacrifice . It was thus an adventure of romantic conquest , mingled with deep religion and arrogant ostentation ; and the entire description of the Aswamedha would prove most interesting . The horse is found , is adorned with the golden plate , and turned loose , wandering into distant regions ; where the army of Arjuna — for it was he who led Yudhishthira 's forces — goes through twelve amazing adventures . They come , for instance , to a land of Amazons , all of wonderful beauty , wearing armour of pearls and gold , and equally fatal either to love or to fight with . These dazzling enemies , however , finally submit , as also the Rajah of the rich city of Babhruváhan , which possessed high walls of solid silver , and was lighted with precious jewels for lamps . The serpent people , in the same way , who live beneath the earth in the city of Vasuki , yield , after combat , to Arjuna . A thousand million semi-human snakemen dwelt there , with wives of consummate loveliness , possessing in their realm gems which would restore dead people to life , as well as a fountain of perpetual youth . Finally , Arjuna 's host marches back in great glory , and with a vast train of vanquished monarchs , to the city of Hastinapura , where all the subject kings have audience of Yudhishthira , and the immense preparations begin for the sacrifice of the snow-white horse .</p>
   <p>After all these stately celebrations , it might be expected that the great poem would conclude with the established glories of the ancient dynasty . But if the martial part of the colossal epic is “ Kshatriyan , ” and the religious episodes “ Brahmanic , ” the conclusion breathes the spirit of Buddhism . Yudhishthira sits grandly on the throne ; but earthly greatness does not content the soul of man , nor can riches render weary hearts happy . A wonderful scene , which reads like a rebuke from the dead addressed to the living upon the madness of all war , occurs in this part of the poem . The Pandavas and the old King Dhritarashtra being together by the banks of the Ganges , the great saint Vyása undertakes to bring back to them all the departed , slain in their fratricidal conflict . The spectacle is at once terrible and tender .</p>
   <p>But this revealing of the invisible world deepens the discontent of the princes , and when the sage Vyása tells them that their prosperity is near its end , they determine to leave their kingdom to younger princes , and to set out with their faces towards Mount Meru , where is Indra 's heaven . If , haply , they may reach it , there will be an end of this world 's joys and sorrows , and “ union with the Infinite ” will be obtained . My translations from the Sanskrit of the two concluding parvas of the poem ( of which the above is a swift summary ) describe the “ Last Journey ” of the princes and their “ Entry into Heaven ; ” and herein occurs one of the noblest religious apologues not only of this great Epic but of any creed ,— a beautiful fable of faithful love which may be contrasted , to the advantage of the Hindu teaching , with any Scriptural representations of Death , and of Love , “ which stronger is than Death . ” There is always something selfish in the anxiety of Orthodox people to save their own souls , and our best religious language is not free from that taint of pious egotism . The Parvas of the Mahábhárata which contain Yudhishthira 's approach to Indra 's paradise teach , on the contrary , that deeper and better lesson nobly enjoined by an American poet —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The gate of heaven opens to none alone ,</l>
     <l n="2">Save thou one soul , and it shall save thine own . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>These prefatory remarks seemed necessary to introduce the subjoined close paraphrase of the “ Book of the Great Journey , ” — and the “ Book of the Entry into Heaven ; ” being the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Parvas of the noble but , as yet , almost unknown Mahábhárata .</p>

   <p>PREFACE</p>
   <p>TO THE “ BOOK OF GOOD COUNSELS . ”</p>
   <p>The Hitopadeśa is a work of high antiquity and extended popularity . The prose is doubtless as old as our own era ; but the intercalated verses and proverbs compose a selection from writings of an age extremely remote . The Mahábhárata and the textual Veds are of those quoted ; to the first of which Professor M. Williams ( in his admirable edition of the Nala , 1860 ) assigns the modest date of 350 B. C ., while he claims for the Rig-Veda an antiquity as high as 1300 B. C . The Hitopadeśa may thus be fairly styled “ The Father of all Fables ; ” for from its numerous translations have probably come Esop and Pilpay , and in latter days Reineke Fuchs . Originally compiled in Sanskrit , it was rendered , by order of Nushirván , in the sixth century A. D ., into Persic . From the Persic it passed , A. D. 850 , into the Arabic , and thence into Hebrew and Greek . In its own land it obtained as wide a circulation . The Emperor Akbar , impressed with the wisdom of its maxims and the ingenuity of its apologues , commended the work of translating it to his own Vizier , Abdul Fazel . That Minister accordingly put the book into a familiar style , and published it with explanations , under the title of the Criterion of Wisdom . The Emperor had also suggested the abridgment of the long series of shlokes which here and there interrupt the narrative , and the Vizier found this advice sound , and followed it , like the present Translator . To this day , in India , the Hitopadeśa , under its own or other names ( as the Anvári Suhaili ) , retains the delighted attention of young and old , and has some representative in all the Indian vernaculars . A selection from the metrical Sanskrit proverbs and maxims is here given .</p>
