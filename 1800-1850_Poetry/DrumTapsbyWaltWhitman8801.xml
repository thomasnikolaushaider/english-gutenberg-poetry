    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">When the first days of August loured over the world , time seemed to stand still . A universal astonishment and confusion fell , as upon a flock of sheep perplexed by strange dogs . But now , though never before was a St. Lucy 's Day so black with “ absence , darkness , death , ” Christmas is gone . Spring comes swiftly , the almond trees flourish . Easter will soon be here . Life breaks into beauty again and we realize that man may bring hell itself into the world , but that Nature ever patiently waits to be his natural paradise . Yet still a kind of instinctive blindness blots out the prospect of the future . Until the long horror of the war is gone from our minds , we shall be able to think of nothing that has not for its background a chaotic darkness . Like every obsession , it gnaws at thought , follows us into our dreams and returns with the morning . But there have been other wars . And humanity , after learning as best it may their brutal lesson , has survived them . Just as the young soldier leaves home behind him and accepts hardship and danger as to the manner born , so , when he returns again , life will resume its old quiet wont . Nature is not idle even in the imagination . It is man 's salvation to forget no less than it is his salvation to remember . And it is wise even in the midst of the conflict to look back on those that are past and to prepare for the returning problems of the future .</p>
    <p n="2">When Whitman wrote his “ Democratic Vistas , ” the long embittered war between the Northern and Southern States of America was a thing only of yesterday . It is a headlong amorphous production — a tangled meadow of “ leaves of grass ” in prose . But it is as cogent to-day as it was when it was written :</p>
    <p n="3">To the ostent of the senses and eyes [ he writes ] , the influences which stamp the world 's history are wars , uprisings , or downfalls of dynasties .... These , of course , play their part ; yet , it may be , a single new thought , imagination , abstract principle ... put in shape by some great literatus , and projected among mankind , may duly cause changes , growths , removals , greater than the longest and bloodiest war , or the most stupendous merely political , dynastic , or commercial overturn .</p>
    <p n="4">The literatus who realized this had his own message in mind . And yet , justly . For those who might point to the worldly prosperity and material comforts of his country , and ask , Are not these better indeed than any utterances even of greatest rhapsodic , artist , or literatus ? he has his irrefutable answer . He surveys the New York of 1870 , “ its façades of marble and iron , of original grandeur and elegance of design , ” etc ., in his familiar catalogical jargon , and shutting his eyes to its glow and grandeur , inquires in return , Are there indeed men here worthy the name ? Are there perfect women ? Is there a pervading atmosphere of beautiful manners ? Are there arts worthy freedom and a rich people ? Is there a great moral and religious civilization — the only justification of a great material one ? We ourselves in good time shall have to face and to answer these questions . They search our keenest hopes of the peace that is coming . And we may be fortified perhaps by the following queer proof of history repeating itself :</p>
    <p n="5">Never , in the Old World , was thoroughly upholster 'd exterior appearance and show , mental and other , built entirely on the idea of caste , and on the sufficiency of mere outside acquisition — never were glibness , verbal intellect , more the test , the emulation — more loftily elevated as head and sample — than they are on the surface of our Republican States this day . The writers of a time hint the mottoes of its gods . The word of the modern , say these voices , is the word Culture .</p>
    <p n="6">Whitman had no very tender regard for the Germany of his time . He fancied that the Germans were like the Chinese , only less graceful and refined and more brutish . But neither had he any particular affection for any relic of Europe . “ Never again will we trust the moral sense or abstract friendliness of a single Government of the Old World . ” He accepted selections from its literature for the new American Adam . But even its greatest poets were not America 's , and though he might welcome even Juvenal , it was for use and not for worship . We have to learn , he insists , that the best culture will always be that of the manly and courageous instincts and loving perceptions , and of self-respect . In our children rests every hope and promise , and therefore in their mothers . “ Disengage yourselves from parties .... These savage and wolfish parties alarm me .... Hold yourself judge and master over all of them . ” Only faith can save us , the faith in ourselves and in our fellow-men which is of the true faith in goodness and in God . The idea of the mass of men , so fresh and free , so loving and so proud , filled this poet with a singular awe . Passionately he pleads for the dignity of the common people . It is the average man of a land that is important . To win the people back to a proud belief and confidence in life , to rapture in this wonderful world , to love and admiration — this was his burning desire . I demand races of orbic bards , he rhapsodizes , sweet democratic despots , to dominate and even destroy . The Future ! Vistas ! The throes of birth are upon us . Allons , camarado !</p>
    <p n="7">He could not despair . “ Must I indeed learn to chant the cold dirges of the baffled ? ” he asks himself in “ Drum-Taps . ” But wildest shuttlecock of criticism though he is , he has never yet been charged with looking only on the dark side of things . Once , he says , “ Once , before the war ( alas ! I dare not say how many times the mood has come ! ) , I too , was fill 'd with doubt and gloom . ” His part in it soothed , mellowed , deepened his great nature . He had himself witnessed such misery , cruelty , and abomination as it is best just now , perhaps , not to read about . One fact alone is enough ; that over fifty thousand Federal soldiers perished of starvation in Southern prisons . Malarial fever contracted in camps and hospitals had wrecked his health . During 1862-65 he visited , he says , eighty to a hundred thousand sick and wounded soldiers , comprehending all , slighting none . Rebel or compatriot , it made no difference . “ I loved the young man , ” he cries again and again . Pity and fatherliness were in his face , for his heart was full of them . Mr. Gosse has described “ the old Gray ” as he saw him in 1884 , in his bare , littered sun-drenched room in Camden , shared by kitten and canary :</p>
    <p n="8">He sat with a very curious pose of the head thrown backward , as if resting it one vertebra lower down the spinal column than other people do , and thus tilting his face a little upwards . With his head so poised and the whole man fixed in contemplation of the interlocutor he seemed to pass into a state of absolute passivity ... the glassy eyes half closed , the large knotted hands spread out before him . He resembled , in fact , nothing so much as “ a great old grey Angora Tom , ” alert in repose , serenely blinking under his combed waves of hair , with eyes inscrutably dreaming .... As I stood in dull , deserted Mickle Street once more , my heart was full of affection for this beautiful old man ... this old rhapsodist in his empty room , glorified by patience and philosophy .</p>
    <p n="9">Whitman was then sixty-five . In a portrait of thirty years before there is just a wraith of that feline dream , perhaps , but it is a face of a rare grace and beauty that looks out at us , of a profound kindness and compassion . And , in the eyes , not so much penetration as visionary absorption . Such was the man to whom nothing was unclean , nothing too trivial ( except “ pale poetlings lisping cadenzas piano , ” who then apparently thronged New York ) to take to himself . Intensest , indomitablest of individualists , he exulted in all that appertains to that forked radish , Man . This contentious soul of mine , he exclaims ecstatically ; Viva : the attack ! I have been born the same as the war was born ; I lull nobody , and you will never understand me : maybe I am non-literary and un-decorous .... I have written impromptu , and shall let it all go at that . Let me at least be human ! Human , indeed , he was , a tender , all-welcoming host of Everyman , of his idolized ( if somewhat overpowering ) American democracy . Man in the street , in his swarms , poor crazed faces in the State asylum , prisoners in Sing Sing , prostitute , whose dead body reminded him not of a lost soul , but only of a sad , forlorn , and empty house — it mattered not ; he opened his heart to them , one and all . “ I see beyond each mark that wonder , a kindred soul . O the bullet could never kill what you really are , dear friend . ”</p>
    <p n="10">The moon gives you light , And the bugles and drums give you music , And my heart , O my soldiers , my veterans , My heart gives you love .</p>
    <p n="11">“ Yours for you , ” he exclaims , welding in a phrase his unparalleled egotism , his beautiful charity , “ yours for you , who ever you are , as mine for me . ” It is the essence of philosophy and of religion , for all the wonders of heaven and earth are significant “ only because of the Me in the centre . ”</p>
    <p n="12">This was the secret of his tender , unassuming ministrations . He had none of that shrinking timidity , that fear of intrusion , that uneasiness in the presence of the tragic and the pitiful , which so often numb and oppress those who would willingly give themselves and their best to the needy and suffering , but whose intellect misgives them . He was that formidable phenomenon , a dreamer of action . But he possessed a sovran good sense . Food and rest and clean clothes were his scrupulous preparation for his visits . He always assumed as cheerful an appearance as possible . Armed with bright new five-cent and ten-cent bills ( the wounded , he found , were often “ broke , ” and the sight of a little money “ helped their spirits ” ) , with books and stationery and tobacco , for one a twist of good strong green tea , for another a good home-made rice-pudding , or a jar of sparkling but innocent blackberry and cherry syrup , a small bottle of horse-radish pickle , or a large handsome apple , he would “ make friends . ” “ What I have I also give you , ” he cried from the bottom of his grieved , tempestuous heart . He would talk , or write letters — passionate love-letters , too — or sit silent , in mute and tender kindness . “ Long , long , I gazed ... leaning my chin in my hands , passing sweet hours , immortal and mystic hours , with you , dearest comrade — not a tear , not a word , Vigil of silence , love and death , vigil for you my son and my soldier . ” And how many a mother must have blessed the stranger who could bring such last news of a son as this : “ And now like many other noble and good men , after serving his country as a soldier , he has yielded up his young life at the very outset in her service . Such things are gloomy — yet there is a text , ‘ God doeth all things well ’ — the meaning of which , after due time , appears to the soul . ” It is only love that can comfort the loving .</p>
    <p n="13">He forced nothing on these friends of a day , so many of them near their last farewell . A poor wasted young man asks him to read a chapter in the New Testament , and Whitman chooses that which describes Christ 's Crucifixion . He “ ask 'd me to read the following chapter also , how Christ rose again . I read very slowly , for he was feeble . It pleased him very much , yet the tears were in his eyes . He ask 'd me if I enjoy 'd religion . I said ‘ Perhaps not , my dear , in the way you mean , yet maybe , it is the same thing . ’ ” This is only one of many such serene intimacies in Whitman 's experiences of the war . Through them we reach to an understanding of a poet who chose not signal and beautiful episodes out of the past , nor the rare moments of existence , for theme , but took all life , within and around him in vast bustling America , for his poetic province . Like a benign barbaric sun he surveys the world , ever at noon . I am the man , I suffer 'd , I was there , he cries in the “ Song of Myself . ” I do not despise you priests , all times , the world over .... He could not despise anything , not even his fellow-poets , because he himself was everything . His verse sometimes seems mere verbiage , but it is always a higgledy-piggledy , Santa Claus bagful of things . And he could penetrate to the essential reality . He tells in his “ Drum-Taps ” how one daybreak he arose in camp , and saw three still forms stretched out in the eastern radiance , how with light fingers he just lifted the blanket from each cold face in turn : the first elderly , gaunt , and grim — Who are you , my dear comrade ? The next with cheeks yet blooming — Who are you , sweet boy ? The third — Young man , I think I know you . I think this face is the face of the Christ Himself , Dead and divine and brother of all , and here again he lies .</p>
    <p n="14">True poetry focuses experience , not merely transmits it . It must redeem it for ever from transitoriness and evanescence . Whitman incontinently pours experience out in a Niagara-like cataract . But in spite of his habitual publicity he was at heart of a “ shy , brooding , impassioned devotional type ” ; in spite of his self-conscious , arrogant virility , he was to the end of his life an entranced child . He came into the world , saw and babbled . His deliberate method of writing could have had no other issue . A subject would occur to him , a kind of tag . He would scribble it down on a scrap of paper and drop it into a drawer . Day by day this first impulse would evoke fresh “ poemets , ” until at length the accumulation was exhaustive . Then he merely gutted his treasury and the ode was complete . It was only when sense and feeling attained a sort of ecstasy that he succeeded in distilling the true essence that is poetry and in enstopping it in a crystal phial of form .</p>
    <p n="15">The prose of his “ Specimen Days , ” indeed , is often nearer to poetry than his verse :</p>
    <p n="16">Much of the time he sleeps , or half sleeps .... I often come and sit by him in perfect silence ; he will breathe for ten minutes as softly and evenly as a young babe asleep . Poor youth , so handsome , athletic , with profuse beautiful shining hair . One time as I sat looking at him while he lay asleep , he suddenly , without the least start awaken 'd , open 'd his eyes , gave me a long steady look , turning his face very slightly to gaze easier — one long , clear , silent look — a slight sigh — then turn 'd back and went into his doze again . Little he knew , poor death-stricken boy , the heart of the stranger that hover 'd near .</p>
    <p n="17">The western star , Venus , in the earlier hours of evening has never been so large , so clear ; it seems as if it told something , as if it held rapport indulgent with humanity , with us Americans . The sky dark blue , the transparent night , the planets , the moderate west wind , the elastic temperature , the miracle of that great star , and the young and swelling moon swimming in the west , suffused the soul . Then I heard slow and clear the deliberate notes of a bugle come up out of the silence ... firm and faithful , floating along , rising , falling leisurely , with here and there a long-drawn note .... sounding tattoo .</p>
    <p n="18">“ A steady rain , dark and thick and warm , ” he writes again , two days after Gettysburg . “ The cavalry camp is a ceaseless field of observation to me . This forenoon there stood the horses , tether 'd together , dripping , steaming , chewing their hay . The men emerge from their tents , dripping also . The fires are half-quench 'd . ” There is a poetic poise in this brief , vivid statement , apart from its bare economy of means . It is the lump awaiting the leaven no less than is “ Cavalry Crossing a Ford . ” To this supreme spectator an apple orchard in May , even the White House in moonlight , no more and no less than these battle-scenes , rendered up their dignity , life , and beauty , their true human significance . But in “ Drum-Taps ” the witness is not always so satisfactory . The secret has evaporated in the effort to make poetry , or half-consciously to inject a moral , to play the Universal Bard . There creeps into the words a tinge of the raw and the grotesque . The poet has the look of a cowboy off the stage , tanned with grease-paint . But again and again the secret creeps back and some lovely emanation of poetry is added to it :</p>
    <p n="19">Look down fair moon and bathe this scene , Pour softly down night 's nimbus floods on faces ghastly , swollen , purple , On the dead on their backs with arms toss 'd wide , Pour down your unstinted nimbus sacred moon .</p>
    <p n="20">Or this , called “ Reconciliation ":</p>
    <p n="21">Word over all , beautiful as the sky , Beautiful that war and all its deeds of carnage must in time be utterly lost , That the hands of the sisters Death and Night incessantly softly wash again , and ever again , this soil 'd world ; For my enemy is dead , a man divine as myself is dead , I look where he lies white-faced and still in the coffin — I draw near , Bend down and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the coffin .</p>
    <p n="22">The bonds of rhyme shackled him , deprived him of more than freedom . He is like a wild bird that suddenly perceives the bars of its small cage across the blue of the sky . And yet the finer his poems are , the nearer they approach to definite rhythmical design . One has only to compare “ O Captain ! my Captain ! ” with “ Hushed be the Camps To-day ” to perceive this curious paradox . They are both of them memories of his beloved Lincoln , whom he had many times seen , with that peculiarly close and transatlantic curiosity of his , riding at a jog-trot , on a good-sized , easy-going grey horse , with his escort of yellow-striped cavalry behind him , through the streets of Washington — dressed in black , somewhat rusty and dusty , with a black , stiff hat , almost as ordinary in attire as the commonest man . That heroic face , too , he had pierced ; and caught from it the deep , subtle , indirect expression , that only the long-gone master-painters of the Old World could have seized and immortalized . And in yet another memory of this great American Whitman attains to his best and highest , “ When Lilacs Last in the Doorway Bloom 'd . ” It is one of the most beautiful of poems , of the purest intuition , of a consummate , if unconscious , artistry . Whose voice is it that rings and echoes , now low and tender , now solemn and desolate , now clear , full , victorious , out of its cloistral solitude — that of the mourner himself , of all-heedfull , heedless Nature , of the immortal soul of man , or just a bird , the shy and hidden , sweet , small hermit thrush ? The last division of his life 's work — his fond Epic , his cosmic “ inventory ” — as Whitman planned it , was to be devoted to the chaunting of songs of death and immortality . The soldier to whom he read of Christ 's Resurrection talked of death to him , and said he did not fear it . He talked to a man who did not enjoy religion in the way a Christian means , to whom the mystery of Easter is an all-sufficing “ reliance . ” But Whitman not only did not fear death . The thought of it was to him the strangest of raptures , the reverie of a child dreaming of a distant mother , soon to come again . Death and immortality were but two aspects of the same blessed hope to this man , who poured out his life in a turgid fount of ecstatic joy in living :</p>
    <p n="23">... And I saw askant the armies , I saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flags , Borne through the smoke of the battles and pierc 'd with missiles I saw them , And carried hither and yon through the smoke , and torn and bloody , And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs ( and all in silence ) , And the staffs all splintered and broken .</p>
    <p n="24">I saw battle-corpses , myriads of them , And the white skeletons of young men , I saw them , I saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war , But I saw they were not as was thought , They themselves were fully at rest , they suffer 'd not , The living remain 'd and suffer 'd , the mother suffer 'd , And the wives and the child and the musing comrade suffer 'd , And the armies that remain 'd suffer 'd ....</p>
    <p n="25">Come lovely and soothing death , Undulate round the world , serenely arriving , arriving , In the night , in the day , to all , to each , Sooner or later delicate death .</p>
    <p n="26">Prais 'd be the fathomless universe , For life and joy , and for objects and knowledge curious , And for love , sweet love — but praise ! praise ! praise ! For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death .</p>
    <p n="27">Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome ? Then I chant it for thee , I glorify thee above all , I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come , come unfalteringly .</p>

    <docTitle><titlePart>DRUM-TAPS FIRST O SONGS FOR A PRELUDE . First O songs for a prelude , Lightly strike on the stretch 'd tympanum pride and joy in my city , How she led the rest to arms , how she gave the cue , How at once with lithe limbs unwaiting a moment she sprang , ( O superb ! O Manhattan , my own , my peerless ! O strongest you in the hour of danger , in crisis ! O truer than steel ! ) How you sprang — how you threw off the costumes of peace with indifferent hand , How your soft opera-music changed , and the drum and fife were heard in their stead , How you led to the war , ( that shall serve for our prelude , songs of soldiers ,) How Manhattan drum-taps led . Forty years had I in my city seen soldiers parading , Forty years as a pageant , still unawares the lady of this teeming and turbulent city , Sleepless amid her ships , her houses , her incalculable wealth , With her million children around her , suddenly , At dead of night , at news from the south , Incens 'd struck with clinch 'd hand the pavement . A shock electric , the night sustain 'd it , Till with ominous hum our hive at daybreak pour 'd out its myriads . From the houses then and the workshops , and through all the doorways , Leapt they tumultuous , and lo ! Manhattan arming . To the drum-taps prompt , The young men falling in and arming , The mechanics arming , ( the trowel , the jack-plane , the blacksmith 's hammer , tost aside with precipitation ,) The lawyer leaving his office and arming , the judge leaving the court , The driver deserting his wagon in the street , jumping down , throwing the reins abruptly down on the horses ’ backs , The salesman leaving the store , the boss , book-keeper , porter , all leaving ; Squads gather everywhere by common consent and arm , The new recruits , even boys , the old men show them how to wear their accoutrements , they buckle the straps carefully , Outdoors arming , indoors arming , the flash of the musketbarrels , The white tents cluster in camps , the arm 'd sentries around , the sunrise cannon and again at sunset , Arm 'd regiments arrive every day , pass through the city , and embark from the wharves , ( How good they look as they tramp down to the river , sweaty , with their guns on their shoulders ! How I love them ! how I could hug them , with their brown faces and their clothes and knapsacks cover 'd with dust ! ) The blood of the city up — arm 'd ! arm 'd ! the cry everywhere , The flags flung out from the steeples of churches and from all the public buildings and stores , The tearful parting , the mother kisses her son , the son kisses his mother , ( Loth is the mother to part , yet not a word does she speak to detain him ,) The tumultuous escort , the ranks of policemen preceding , clearing the way , The unpent enthusiasm , the wild cheers of the crowd for their favorites , The artillery , the silent cannons bright as gold , drawn along , rumble lightly over the stones , ( Silent cannons , soon to cease your silence , Soon unlimber 'd to begin the red business ;) All the mutter of preparation , all the determin 'd arming , The hospital service , the lint , bandages and medicines , The women volunteering for nurses , the work begun for in earnest , no mere parade now ; War ! an arm 'd race is advancing ! the welcome for battle , no turning away ; War ! be it weeks , months , or years , an arm 'd race is advancing to welcome it . Mannahatta a-march — and it 's O to sing it well ! It 's O for a manly life in the camp . And the sturdy artillery , The guns bright as gold , the work for giants , to serve well the guns , Unlimber them ! ( no more as the past forty years for salutes for courtesies merely , Put in something now besides powder and wadding . ) And you lady of ships , you Mannahatta , Old matron of this proud , friendly , turbulent city , Often in peace and wealth you were pensive or covertly frown 'd amid all your children , But now you smile with joy exulting old Mannahatta . EIGHTEEN SIXTY-ONE . Arm 'd year — year of the struggle , No dainty rhymes or sentimental love verses for you terrible year , Not you as some pale poetling seated at a desk lisping cadenzas piano , But as a strong man erect , clothed in blue clothes , advancing , carrying a rifle on your shoulder , With well-gristled body and sunburnt face and hands , with a knife in the belt at your side , As I heard you shouting loud , your sonorous voice ringing across the continent , Your masculine voice O year , as rising amid the great cities , Amid the men of Manhattan I saw you as one of the workmen , the dwellers in Manhattan , Or with large steps crossing the prairies out of Illinois and Indiana , Rapidly crossing the West with springy gait and descending the Alleghanies , Or down from the great lakes or in Pennsylvania , or on deck along the Ohio river , Or southward along the Tennessee or Cumberland rivers , or at Chattanooga on the mountain top , Saw I your gait and saw I your sinewy limbs clothed in blue , bearing weapons , robust year , Heard your determin 'd voice launch 'd forth again and again , Year that suddenly sang by the mouths of the round-lipp 'd cannon , I repeat you , hurrying , crashing , sad , distracted year .</titlePart></docTitle>

       <l n="10">No further does she say , but lingering all the day ,</l>

       <l n="12">And courtesies to the regiments , the guidons moving by .</l>

     <p>What is it fateful woman , so blear , hardly human ? Why wag your head with turban bound , yellow , red and green ? Are the things so strange and marvellous you see or have seen ?</p>
