   <head>INTRODUCTORY ESSAY</head>
   <p>We propose to introduce our ‘ Specimens ’ by a short Essay on the Origin and Progress of English Poetry on to the days of Chaucer and of Gower . Having called , in conjunction with many other critics , Chaucer ‘ the Father of English Poetry , ’ to seek to go back further may seem like pursuing antenatal researches . But while Chaucer was the sun , a certain glimmering dawn had gone before him , and to reflect that , is the object of the following pages .</p>
   <p>Britain , when the Romans invaded it , was a barbarous country ; and although subjugated and long held by that people , they seem to have left it nearly as uncultivated and illiterate as they found it . ‘ No magnificent remains , ’ says Macaulay , ‘ of Latian porches and aqueducts are to be found in Britain . No writer of British birth is to be reckoned among the masters of Latin poetry and eloquence . It is not probable that the islanders were , at any time , generally familiar with the tongue of their Italian rulers . From the Atlantic to the vicinity of the Rhine the Latin has , during many centuries , been predominant . It drove out the Celtic — it was not driven out by the Teutonic — and it is at this day the basis of the French , Spanish , and Portuguese languages . In our island the Latin appears never to have superseded the old Gaelic speech , and could not stand its ground before the German . ’ It was in the fifth century that that modification of the German or Teutonic speech called the Anglo-Saxon was introduced into this country . It soon asserted its superiority over the British tongue , which seemed to retreat before it , reluctantly and proudly , like a lion , into the mountain-fastnesses of Wales or to the rocky sea-beach of Cornwall . The triumph was not completed all at once , but from the beginning it was secure . The bards of Wales continued to sing , but their strains resembled the mutterings of thunder among their own hills , only half heard in the distant valleys , and exciting neither curiosity nor awe . For five centuries , with the exception of some Latin words added by the preachers of Christianity , the Anglo-Saxon language continued much as it was when first introduced . Barbarous as the manners of the people were , literature was by no means left without a witness . Its chief cultivators were the monks and other religious persons , who spent their leisure in multiplying books , either by original composition or by transcription , including treatises on theology , historical chronicles , and a great abundance and variety of poetical productions . These were written at first exclusively in Latin , but occasionally , in process of time , in the Anglo - Saxon tongue . The theology taught in them was , no doubt , crude and corrupted , the history was stuffed with fables , and the poetry was rough and bald in the extreme ; but still they furnished a food fitted for the awakening mind of the age . When the Christian religion reached Great Britain , it brought necessarily with it an impulse to intellect as well as to morality . So startling are the facts it relates , so broad and deep the principles it lays down , so humane the spirit it inculcates , and so ravishing the hopes it awakens , that , however disguised in superstition and clouded by imperfect representation , it never fails to produce , in all countries to which it comes , a resurrection of the nation 's virtue , and a revival , for a time at least , of the nation 's political and intellectual energy and genius . Hence we find the very earliest literary names in our early annals are those of Christian missionaries . Such is said to have been Gildas , a Briton , who lived in the first part of the sixth century , and is the reputed author of a short history of Britain in Latin . Such was the still more apocryphal Nennius , also called , till of late , the writer of a small Latin historical work . Such was St Columbanus , who was born in Ireland in 560 ; became a monk in the Irish monastery of Benchor ; and afterwards , at the head of twelve disciples , preached Christianity , in its most ascetic form , in England and in France ; founded in the latter country various monasteries ; and , when banished by Queen Brunehaut on account of his stern inflexibility of character , went to Switzerland , and then to Lombardy , proselytising the heathen , and defending , by his letters and other writings , the peculiar tenets of the Irish Church in reference to the time of the celebration of Easter and to the popular heresies of the day . He died October 2 , 615 , in the monastery of Bobbio ; and his religious treatises and Latin poetry gave an undoubted impulse to the age 's progress in letters .</p>
   <p>About this period the better sort of Saxons , both clergy and laity , got into the habit of visiting Rome ; while Rome , in her turn , sent emissaries to England . Thus , while the one insensibly imbibed new knowledge as well as devotion from the great centre , the other brought with them to our shores importations of books , including copies of such religious classics as Josephus and Chrysostom , and of such literary classics as Homer . About 680 , died Caedmon , a monk of Whitby , one of the first who composed in Anglo-Saxon , and some of whose compositions are preserved . Strange and myth-like stories are told by Bede about this remarkable natural genius . He was originally a cow-herd . Partly from want of training , and partly from bashfulness , when the harp was given him in the hall , and he was asked , as all others were , to raise the voice of song , Caedmon had often to abscond in confusion . On one occasion he had retired to the stable , where he fell into a sound sleep . He dreamed that a stranger appeared to him , and said , ‘ Caedmon , sing me something . ’ Caedmon replied that it was his incapacity to sing which had brought him to take refuge in the stable . ‘ Nay , ’ said the stranger , ‘ but thou hast something to sing . ’ ‘ What shall I sing ? ’ rejoined Caedmon . ‘ Sing the Creation , ’ and thereupon he began to pour out verses , which , when he awoke , he remembered , repeated , and to which he added others as good . The first lines are , as translated into English , the following :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Now let us praise</l>
     <l n="2">The Guardian of heaven ,</l>
     <l n="3">The might of the Creator</l>
     <l n="4">And his counsel —</l>
     <l n="5">The Glory !— Father of men !</l>
     <l n="6">He first created ,</l>
     <l n="7">For the children of men ,</l>
     <l n="8">Heaven as a roof —</l>
     <l n="9">The holy Creator !</l>
     <l n="10">Then the world —</l>
     <l n="11">The Guardian of mankind !</l>
     <l n="12">The Eternal Lord !</l>
     <l n="13">Produced afterwards</l>
     <l n="14">The Earth for men —</l>
     <l n="15">The Almighty Master ! ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Our readers all remember the well-known story of Coleridge falling asleep over Purchas 's ‘ Pilgrims ’ ; how the poem of ‘ Kubla Khan ’ came rushing from dreamland upon his soul ; and how , when awakened , he wrote it down , and found it to be , if not sense , something better — a glorious piece of fantastic imagination . We knew a gentleman who , slumbering while in a state of bad health , produced , in the course of a few hours , one or two thousand rhymed lines , some of which he repeated in our hearing afterwards , and which were full of point and poetry . We cannot see that Caedmon 's lines betray any weird inspiration ; but when rehearsed the next day to the Abbess Hilda , to whom the town-bailiff of Whitby conducted him , she and a circle of learned men pronounced that he had received the gift of song direct from heaven ! They , after one or two other trials of his powers , persuaded him to become a monk in the house of the Abbess , who commanded him to transfer to verse the whole of the Scripture history . It is said that he was constantly employed in repeating to himself what he had heard ; or , as one of his old biographers has it , ‘ like a clean animal ruminating it , he turned it into most sweet verse . ’ In this way he wrote or rather improvised a vast quantity of poetry , chiefly on religious subjects . Thorpe , in his edition of this author , has preserved a speech of Satan , bearing a striking resemblance to some parts of Milton :—</p>

     <l n="4">His due punishment .</l>
     <l n="5">“ This narrow place is most unlike</l>
     <l n="6">That other that we formerly knew</l>
     <l n="7">High in heaven 's kingdom ,</l>
     <l n="8">Which my master bestowed on me ,</l>

     <l n="46">About the realm of heaven ,</l>
     <l n="47">Where I had power of my hands . " ’</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Through these rude lines there flashes forth , like fire through a thick dull grating , a powerful conception — one which Milton has borrowed and developed — that of the Evil One feeling in his dark bosom jealousy at young Man , almost overpowering his hatred to God ; and another conception still more striking , that of the devil 's thorough conviction that all his plans and thoughts are entirely known by his great Adversary , and are counteracted before they are formed —</p>
   <p>‘ Thus perceive I that he knoweth my mind . ’</p>
   <p>Compare this with Milton 's lines —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ So should I purchase dear</l>
     <l n="2">Short intermission , bought with double smart .</l>
     <l n="3">This knows my Punisher ; therefore as far</l>
     <l n="4">From granting he , as I from begging peace . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Caedmon saw , without being able fully to express , the complex idea of Satan , as distracted between a thousand thoughts , all miserable — tossed between a thousand winds , all hot as hell — ‘ pale ire , envy , and despair ’ struggling within him — fury at man overlapping anger at God — remorse and reckless desperation wringing each other 's miserable hands — a sense of guilt which will not confess , a fear that will not quake , a sorrow that will not weep , a respect for God which will not worship ; and yet , springing out of all these elements , a strange , proud joy , as though the torrid soil of Pandemonium should flower , which makes ‘ the hell he suffers seem a heaven , ’ compared to what his destiny might be were he either plunged into a deeper abyss , or taken up unchanged to his former abode of glory . This , in part at least , the monk of Whitby discerned ; but it was reserved for Milton to embody it in that tremendous figure which has since continued to dwindle all the efforts of art , and to haunt , like a reality , the human imagination .</p>
   <p>Passing over some interesting but subordinate Saxon writers , such as Ceolfrid , Abbot of Wearmouth ; Aldhelm , Abbot of Malmesbury ; Felix of Croyland ; and Alcuine , King Egbert 's librarian at York , we come to one who himself formed an era in the history of our early literature — the venerable Bede . This famous man was educated in the monastery of Wearmouth , and there appears to have spent the whole of his quiet , innocent , and studious life . He was the very sublimation of a book-worm . One might fancy him becoming at last , as in the ‘ Metamorphoses ’ of Ovid , one of the books , or rolls of vellum and parchment over which he con - stantly pored . That he did not marry , or was given in marriage , we are certain ; but there is little evidence that he even ate or drank , walked or slept . To read and to write seemed the ‘ be all and the end all ’ of his existence . Important as well as numerous were his contributions to literature . He translated from the Scriptures . He wrote religious treatises , biographies , and commentaries upon portions of Holy Writ . Besides his very valuable Ecclesiastical History , he composed various pieces of Latin poetry . His works in all were forty-four in number : and it is said that on the very day of his death ( it took place in 735 ) he was dictating to his amanuensis , and had just completed a book . His works are wonderful for his time , and not the less interesting for a fine cobweb of fable which is woven over parts of them , and which seems in keeping with their venerable character . Thus , in speaking of the Magi who visited the infant Redeemer , he is very particular in describing their age , appearance , and offerings . Melchior , the first , was old , had gray hair , and a long beard ; and offered ‘ gold ’ to Christ , in , acknowledgment of His sovereignty . Gaspar , the second , was young , and had no beard ; and he offered ‘ frankincense , ’ in recognition of our Lord 's divinity . Balthasar , the third , was of a dark complexion , had a large beard , and offered ‘ myrrh ’ to our Saviour 's humanity . We should , we confess , miss such pleasant little myths in other old books besides Bede 's Histories . They seem appropriate to ancient works , as the beard is to the goat or the hermit ; and the truth that lies in them is not difficult to eliminate . The next name of note in our literary annals is that of the great Alfred . Surely if ever man was not only before his age , but before ‘ all ages , ’ it was he . A palm of the tropics growing on a naked Highland mountain-side , or an English oak bending over one of the hot springs of Hecla , were not a stranger or more preternatural sight than a man like Alfred appearing in a century like the ninth . A thousand theories about men being the creatures of their age , the products of circumstances , &amp; c ., sink into abeyance beside the facts of his life ; and we are driven to the good old belief that to some men the ‘ inspiration of the Almighty giveth understanding ; ’ and that their wisdom , their genius , and their excellency do not proceed from them-selves . On his deeds of valour and patriotism it is not necessary to dwell . These form the popular and bepraised side of his character , but they give a very inadequate idea of the whole . On one occasion he visited the Danish camp — a king disguised as a harper ; but he was , all his life long , a harper disguised as a king . He was at once a warrior , a legislator , an architect , a shipbuilder , a philosopher , a scholar , and a poet . His great object , as avowed in his last will , was to leave his people ‘ free as their own thoughts . ’ Hence he bent the whole force of his mind , first , to defend them from foreign foes , by encouraging the new naval strength he had himself established ; and then to cultivate their intellects , and make them , as well as their country , worth defending . Let us quote the glowing words of Burke :— ‘ He was indefatigable in his endeavours to bring into England men of learning in all branches from every part of Europe , and unbounded in his liberality to them . He enacted by a law that every person possessed of two hides of land should send their children to school until sixteen . He enterprised even a greater design than that of forming the growing generation — to instruct even the grown , enjoining all his sheriffs and other officers immediately to apply themselves to learning , or to quit their offices . Whatever trouble he took to extend the benefits of learning among his subjects , he shewed the example himself , and applied to the cultivation of his mind with unparalleled diligence and success . He could neither read nor write at twelve years old , but he improved his time in such a manner , that he became one of the most knowing men of his age , in geometry , in philosophy , in architecture , and in music . He applied himself to the improvement of his native language ; he translated several valuable works from Latin , and wrote a vast number of poems in the Saxon tongue with a wonderful facility and happiness . He not only excelled in the theory of the arts and sciences , but possessed a great mechanical genius for the executive part . He improved the manner of shipbuilding , introduced a more beautiful and commodious architecture , and even taught his countrymen the art of making bricks ; most of the buildings having been of wood before his time — in a word , he comprehended in the greatness of his mind the whole of government , and all its parts at once ; and what is most difficult to human frailty was at the same time sublime and minute . ’</p>
   <p>Some exaggeration must be allowed for in all this account of Alfred the Great . But the fact that he left a stamp in his age so deep ,— that nothing except what was good and great has been ascribed to him ,— that the very fictions told of him are of such vraisemblance and magnitude as to FIT IN to nothing less than an extraordinary man ,— and that , as Burke says , ‘ whatever dark spots of human frailty may have adhered to such a character , are entirely hid in the splendour of many shining qualities and grand virtues , that throw a glory over the obscure period in which he lived , and which is for no other reason worthy of our knowledge , ’ — all proclaim his supremacy . Like many great men ,— like Julius Caesar , with his epilepsy — or Sir Walter Scott and Byron , with their lameness — or Schleiermacher , with his deformed appearance ,— a physical infirmity beset Alfred most of his life , and at last carried him off at a comparatively early age . This was a disease in his bowels , which had long afflicted him , ‘ without interrupting his designs , or souring his temper . ’ Nay , who can say that the constant presence of such a memento of weakness and mortality did not operate as a strong , quiet stimulus to do with his might what his hand found to do — to lower pride , and to prompt to labour ? If Saladin had had for his companion some such faithful hound of sorrow , it would have saved him the ostentatious flag stretched over his head , in the hour of wassail , with the inscription , ‘ Saladin , Saladin , king of kings ! Saladin must die ! ’</p>
   <p>Alfred wrote little that was original , but he was a copious translator . He rendered into the Anglo-Saxon tongue — which he sought to enrich with the fatness of other soils — the historical works of Orosius and of Bede ; nay , it is said the Fables of Aesop , and the Psalms of David — desirous , it would seem , to teach his people morality and religion , through the fine medium , of fiction and poetry .</p>
   <p>Alfric , Archbishop of Canterbury , is the name of another important contributor to Saxon literature . He wrote a grammar of his native language , which procured him the name of the ‘ Grammarian , ’ besides a collection of homilies , some theological treatises , and a translation of the first seven books of the Old Testament . In imitation of Alfred , he devoted all his energies to the instruction of the common people , constantly writing in Anglo-Saxon , and avoiding as much as possible the use of compound or obscure words . After him appeared Cynewulf , Bishop of Winchester , Wulfstan , Archbishop of York , and others of some note . There was also slowly piled up in the course of ages , and by a succession of authors , that remarkable production , ‘ The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle . ’ This is thought to have commenced soon after the reign of Alfred , and continued till the times of Henry II . Previous , however , to the Norman invasion , there had been a decided falling off in the learning of the Saxons . This arose from various causes . Incessant wars tended to conserve and increase the barbarism of the people . Various libraries of value were destroyed by the incursions of the Danes . And not a few bishops , and other ecclesiastical dignitaries , began to consider learning as prejudicial to piety-and grammar and ungodliness were thought akin . The effect of this upon the subordinate clergy was most pernicious . In the tenth century , Oswald , Archbishop of Canterbury , found the monks of his province so grossly ignorant , not only of letters , but even of the canonical rules of their respective orders , that he required to send to France for competent masters to give them instruction .</p>
   <p>At length came the Conqueror , William , and one battle gave England to the Normans , which had cost the Romans , the Saxons , and the Danes so much time and blood to acquire . The people were not only conquered , but cowed and crushed . England was as easily and effectually subdued as was Ireland , sometime after , by Henry II . But while the Conquest was for a season fatal to liberty , it was from the first favourable to every species of literature , art , and poetry . ‘ The influence , ’ says Campbell , ‘ of the Norman Conquest upon the language of England was like that of a great inundation , which at first buries the face of the landscape under its waters , but which , at last subsiding , leaves behind it the elements of new beauty and fertility . Its first effect was to degrade the Anglo - Saxon tongue to the exclusive use of the inferior orders , and by the transference of estates ecclesiastical benefices , and civil dignities to Norman possessors , to give the French language , which had begun to prevail at court from the time of Edward the Confessor , a more complete predominance among the higher classes of society . The native gentry of England were either driven into exile , or depressed into a state of dependence on their conqueror , which habituated them to speak his language . On the other hand , we received from the Normans the first germs of romantic poetry ; and our language was ultimately indebted to them for a wealth and compass of expression which it probably would not have otherwise possessed . ’</p>
   <p>The Anglo-Saxon , however , held its place long among the lower orders , and specimens of it , both in prose and verse , are found a century after the Conquest . Gradually the Norman tongue began to amalgamate with it , and the result was , the English . At what precise year our language might be said to begin , it is impossible to determine . Throughout the whole of the twelfth century , great changes were taking place in the grammatical construction , as well as in the substance of the Anglo-Saxon . Some new words were imported from the Norman , but , as Dr Johnson remarks , ‘ the language was still more materially altered by the change of its sounds , the cutting short of its syllables , and the softening down of its terminations , and inflections of words . ’ Somewhere between 1180 and 1216 , the majestic speech in which Shakspeare was to write ‘ Macbeth ’ and ‘ King Lear , ’ Lord Bacon his ‘ Advancement of Learning , ’ Milton his ‘ Paradise Lost ’ and ‘ Areopagitica , ’ Burke his ‘ Reflections , ’ and Sir Walter Scott the Waverley Novels , and whose rough , but manly accents were to be spoken by at least a hundred million tongues , commenced its career , and not since Homer ,</p>
   <p>“ on the Chian strand , Beheld the Iliad and the Odyssee Rise to the swelling of the voiceful sea , ”</p>
   <p>had a nobler era been marked in the history of literature . For here was a tongue born which was destined to mate even with that of Greece in richness and flexibility , to make the language of Cicero and Virgil seem stiff and stilted in comparison , and , if not to vie with the French in airy grace , or with the Italian in liquid music , to excel them far in teeming resources and robust energy . Memorable and hallowed for ever be the hour when the ‘ well of English undefiled ’ first sparkled to the day !</p>
   <p>Previous to this the chief of the poets , after the Conquest , were Normans . The country whence that people came had for some time been celebrated for poetry . France was , as to its poetic literature , divided into two great sections — the Provençal and the Northern . The first was like the country where it flourished — gay , flowery , and exuberant ; it swam in romance , and its rhymers delighted , when addressing large audiences under the open skies of their delightful climate , to indulge in compliment and fanfaronade , to sing of war , wine , and love .</p>
   <p>The Normans produced a race of simpler poets . That some of them were men as well as singers , is proved by the fact that it was a bard named Taillefer who first broke the English ranks at the battle of Hastings . After him came Philippe de Thaun , who tried to set to song the science of his day ; Thorold , the author of a romance entitled ‘ Roland ; ’ Samson de Nauteuil , the translator of Solomon 's Proverbs into French verse ; Geoffrey Gaimar , who wrote a Chronicle of the Saxon kings ; and one David , a minstrel of no little note and power in his day . But a more remarkable writer succeeded , and his work , like Aaron 's rod , swallowed up all the productions of these clever but petty poets . This was Wace , commonly called Maistre Wace , a native of Jersey . In 1160 , or as some say 1155 , Wace finished his ‘ Brut d'Angleterre ’ which is in reality a translation into French of Geoffrey of Monmouth , who wrote a History of Britain from the imaginary Brutus of Troy down to Cadwallader in 689 . Literature owes not a little to Wace 's poem . He collected into a permanent shape a number of traditions and legends — many of them interesting — which had been floating through Europe , just as Macpherson preserved in Ossian not a few real fragments of the songs of Selma . And , as we shall see immediately , Wace 's production became the basis of the earliest of English poems .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Maistre Wace is the author also of a History of the Normans , which he</l>
     <l n="2">calls ‘ Roman de Rou ; ’ or , ‘ The Romance of Rollo . ’ He was a great favourite</l>
     <l n="3">with Henry II ., who bestowed on him a canonry in the Cathedral of Bayeux .</l>
     <l n="4">Besides Wace , there flourished about the same time Benoit , who wrote a</l>
     <l n="5">History of the Dukes of Normandy ; and Guernes , a churchman of Pont St</l>
     <l n="6">Maxence in Picardy , who wrote in verse a Life of St Thomas à Becket .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>At the beginning of the century following the Conquest , the chief authors , such as Peter of Blois , John of Salisbury , Joseph of Exeter , and Geoffrey of Monmouth , all wrote in Latin . Layamon , however , a priest of Ernesley - upon-Severn , used the vernacular in a poem which , as we have already hinted , was essentially a translation of Wace 's ‘ Brut d'Angleterre . ’ The most remarkable thing about Layamon 's poem is the language in which it is written-language in which you catch English in the very act of chipping the Saxon shell , or , as Campbell happily remarks , ‘ the style of Layamon is as nearly the intermediate state of the old and new languages as can be found in any ancient specimen — something like the new insect stirring its wings before it has shaken off the aurelia state . ’</p>
   <p>Between Layamon and Robert of Gloucester a good many miscellaneous strains — some of a satirical , others of an amatory , and others again of a legendary and devout style — were produced . It was customary then for minstrels , at the instance of the clergy , to sing on Sundays devotional strains on the harp to the assembled multitudes . At public entertainments , during week-days , gay ditties were common . One of these is extant , but is too coarse for quotation . It is entitled ‘ The Land of Cokayne , ’ an allegorical satire on the luxury and vice of the Church , given under the description of an imaginary paradise , in which the nuns are represented as houris , and the black and grey monks as their paramours . ‘ Richard of Alemaine ’ is a ballad , composed by an adherent of Simon de Montfort , Earl of Leicester , after the defeat of the Royal party at the battle of Lewes in 1264 . In the year after that battle the Royal cause rallied , and the Earl of Warren and Sir Hugh Bigod returned from exile , and helped the King in his victory . In the battle of Lewes , Richard , King of the Romans , his brother Henry III ., and Prince Edward , with many others of the Royal party , were taken prisoners . [ Note : See ‘ Richard of Alemaine , ’ Percy 's Reliques , vol . ii ., p . 2 . ]</p>
   <p>The spirit and the allusions of this song shew that it was composed by Leicester 's party in the moment of their victory , and not after the reaction which took place against their cause , and it must therefore belong to the thirteenth century . To this period , too , probably belongs a political satire , published by Ritson , and which Campbell thus charac - terises :— ‘ It is a ballad on the execution of the Scottish patriots , Sir William Wallace and Sir Simon Frazer . The diction is as barbarous as we should expect from a song of triumph on such a subject . It relates the death and treatment of Wallace very minutely . The circumstance of his being covered with a mock crown of laurel in Westminster Hall , which Stow repeats , is there mentioned , and that of his legs being fastened with iron fetters “ under his horse 's wombe ” is told with savage exultation . The piece was probably indited in the very year of the political murders which it celebrates , certainly before 1314 , as it mentions the skulking of Robert Bruce , which , after the battle of Bannockburn , must have become a jest out of season . ’</p>
   <p>Campbell quotes a love-ditty of this period , which is not devoid of merit :—</p>

   <p>About a hundred years after Layamon ( in 1280 ) appeared a poet not dissimilar to him , named Robert of Gloucester . His surname is unknown , and so are the particulars of his history . We know only that he was a monk of Gloucester Abbey , that he lived in the reigns of Henry III . and Edward I ., and that he translated the Legends of Geoffrey of Monmouth , and continued the History of England down to the time of Edward I . This work is wonder - fully minute , and , generally speaking , accurate in its topography as well as narrative , and was of service to Selden when he wrote his Notes to Drayton 's ‘ Polyolbion . ’ It is more valuable in this respect than as a piece of imagination .</p>
   <p>He narrates the grandest events — such as the first crusaders bursting into Asia , with a sword of fire hung in the firmament before them , and beckoning them on their way — as coolly as he might the emigration of a colony of ants . Yet , although there is little animation or poetry in his general manner , he usually succeeds in riveting the reader 's attention ; and the speeches he puts into the mouths of his heroes glow with at least rhetorical fire . And as a critic truly remarks — ‘ Injustice to the ancient versifier , we should remember that he had still only a rude language to employ , the speech of boors and burghers , which , though it might possess a few songs and satires , could afford him no models of heroic narration . In such an age the first occupant passes uninspired over subjects which might kindle the highest enthusiasm in the poet of a riper period , as the savage treads unconsciously in his deserts over mines of incalculable value , without sagacity to discover or inplements to explore them . ’ We give the following extracts from Robert of Gloucester 's poem :—</p>

    <head>AN OLD TRADITION .</head>
    <head>It was a tradition invented by the old fablers that giants brought the stones of Stonehenge from the most sequestered deserts of Africa , and placed them in Ireland ; that every stone was washed with juices of herbs , and contained a medical power ; and that Merlin , the magician , at the request of King Arthur , transported them from Ireland , and erected them in circles on the plain of Amesbury , as a sepulchral monument for the Britons treacherously slain by Hengist . This fable is thus delivered , without decoration , by Robert of Glocester :—</head>

   <p>The next name of note is Robert , commonly called De Brunne . His real name was Robert Manning . He was born at Malton in Yorkshire ; for some time belonged to the house of Sixhill , a Gilbertine monastery in Yorkshire ; and afterwards became a member of Brunne or Browne , a priory of black canons in the same county . When monastical writers became famous , they were usually designated from the religious houses to which they belonged . Thus it was with Matthew of Westminster , William of Malmesbury , and John of Glastonbury — all received their appellations from their respective monasteries . De Brunne 's principal work is a Chronicle of the History of England , in rhyme . It can in no way be considered an original production , but is partly translated , and partly compiled from the writings of Maistre Wace and Peter de Langtoft , which latter was a canon of Bridlington in Yorkshire , of Norman origin , but born in England , and the author of an entire History of his country in French verse , down to the end of the reign of Edward I. Brunne 's Chronicle seems to have been written about the year 1303 . We extract the Prologue , and two other passages :—</p>

   <p>Of De Brunne , Warton judiciously remarks — ‘ Our author also translated into English rhymes the treatise of Cardinal Bonaventura , his contemporary , De coena et passione Domini , et paenis S. Mariae Virgins . But I forbear to give more extracts from this writer , who appears to have possessed much more industry than genius , and cannot at present be read with much pleasure . Yet it should be remembered that even such a writer as Robert de Brunne , uncouth and unpleasing as he naturally seems , and chiefly employed in turning the theology of his age into rhyme , contributed to form a style , to teach expression , and to polish his native tongue . In the infancy of language and composition , nothing is wanted but writers ;— at that period even the most artless have their use . ’</p>
   <p>Here we may allude to the introduction of romantic fiction into English poetry . This had , as we have seen , reigned in France . There troubadours in Provence , and men more worthy of the name of poets in Normandy , had long sung of Brutus , of Charlemagne , and of Rollo . And thence a class , called sometimes Joculators , sometimes Jongleurs , and sometimes Minstrels , issued , harp in hand , wandering to and fro , and singing tales of chivalry and love , composed either by themselves , or by other poets living or dead . ( We refer our readers to our first volume of Percy 's ‘ Reliques , ’ for a full account of this class , and of the poetry they produced . ) These wanderers reached England in due time and brought with them compositions which found favour and excited emulation , or at least imitation , in our vernacular genius . Hence came a great swarm of romances , all more or less derived from the French , even when Saxon in subject and style ; such as ‘ Sir Tristrem , ’ ( which Sir Walter Scott tried in vain to prove to be written by the famous Thomas the Rhymer , of Ercildoun , or Earlston , in Berwickshire , who died before 1299 ;) ‘ The Life of Alexander the Great , ’ said to be written by Adam Davie , Marshall of Stratford-le-Bow , who lived about 1312 ; ‘ King Horn , ’ which certainly belongs to the latter part of the thirteenth century ; ‘ The Squire of Low Degree ; ‘ Sir Guy ; ’ ‘ Sir Degore ; ’ ‘ The King of Tars ; ’ ‘ King Robert of Sicily ; ’ ‘ La Mort d'Arthur ; ’ ‘ Impodemon ; ’ and , more lately , ‘ Sir Libius ; ’ ‘ Sir Thopas ; ’ ‘ Sir Isenbras ; ’ ‘ Gawan and Gologras ; ’ and ‘ Sir Bevis . ’ Richard I. also formed the subject of a very popular romance . We give extracts from it :—</p>

   <p>Davie was also the author of an original poem , entitled , ‘ Visions in Verse , ’ and of the ‘ Battle of Jerusalem , ’ in which he versifies a French romance . In this production Pilate is represented as challenging our Lord to single combat !</p>
   <p>In 1349 , died Richard Rollo , a hermit , and a verse-writer . He lived a secluded life near the nunnery of Hampole in Yorkshire , and wrote a number of devotional pieces , most of them very dull . In 1350 , Lawrence Minot produced some short narrative ballads on the victories of Edward III ., beginning with Halidon Hill , and ending with the siege of Guisnes Castle . His works lay till the end of the last century obscure in a MS. of the Cotton Collection , which was supposed to be a transcript of the Works of Chaucer . On a spare leaf of the MS. there had been accidentally written a name , probably that of its original possessor , ‘ Richard Chawsir . ’ This the getter-up of the Cotton catalogue imagined to be the name of Geoffrey Chaucer . Mr Tyrwhitt , while foraging for materials to his edition of ‘ The Canterbury Tales , ’ accidentally found out who the real writer was ; and Ritson afterwards published Minot 's ballads , which are ten in number , written in the northern dialect , and in an alliterative style , and with considerable spirit and liveliness . He has been called the Tyrtaeus of his age .</p>
   <p>We come now to the immediate predecessor of Chaucer — Robert Langlande . He was a secular priest , born at Mortimer 's Cleobury , in Shropshire , and educated at Oriel College , Oxford . He wrote , towards the end of the fourteenth century , a very remarkable work , entitled , ‘ Visions of William concerning Piers Plowman . ’ The general object of this poem is to denounce the abuses of society , and to inculcate , upon both clergy and laity , their respective duties . One William is represented as falling asleep among the Malvern Hills , and sees in his dream a succession of visions , in which great ingenuity , great boldness , and here and there a powerful vein of poetry , are displayed . Truth is described as a magnificent tower , and Falsehood as a deep dungeon . In one canto Religion descends , and gives a long harangue about what should be the conduct of society and of individuals . Bribery and Falsehood , in another part of the poem , seek a marriage with each other , and make their way to the courts of justice , where they find many friends . Some very whimsical passages are introduced . The Power of Grace confers upon Piers Plowman , who stands for the Christian Life , four stout oxen , to cultivate the field of Truth . These are Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John , the last of whom is described as the gentlest of the team . She afterwards assigns him the like number of stots or bullocks , to harrow what the evangelists had ploughed , and this new horned team consists of Saint or Stot Ambrose , Stot Austin , Stot Gregory , and Stot Jerome .</p>
   <p>Apart from its fantastic structure , ‘ Piers Plowman ’ was not only a sign of the times , but did great service in its day . His voice rings like that of Israel 's minor prophets — like Nahum or Hosea — in a dark and corrupt age . He proclaims liberal and independent sentiments , he attacks slavery and superstition , and he predicts the doom of the Papacy as with a thunder-knell . Chaucer must have felt roused to his share of the reformatory work by the success of ‘ Piers Plowman ; ’ Spenser is suspected to have read and borrowed from him ; and even Milton , in his description of a lazar-house in ‘ Paradise Lost , ’ had him probably in his eye . ( See our last extract from ‘ Piers . ’ )</p>
   <p>On account of the great merit and peculiarity of this work we proceed to make rather copious extracts .</p>

   <p>ADVERTISEMENT .</p>
   <p>It will be observed that , in the specimens given of the earlier poets , the spelling has been modernised on the principle which has been so generally approved in its application to the text of Chaucer and of Spenser .</p>
   <p>On a further examination of the material for ‘ Specimens and Memoirs of the less-known British Poets , ’ it has been deemed advisable to devote three volumes to this résumé , and merely to give extracts from Cowley , instead of following out the arrangement proposed when the issue for this year was announced . In this space it has been found possible to present the reader with specimens of almost all those authors whose writings were at any period esteemed . The series will thus be rendered more perfect , and will include the complete works of the authors whose entire writings are by a general verdict regarded as worthy of preservation ; together with representations of the style , and brief notices of the poets who have , during the progress of our literature , occupied a certain rank , but whose popularity and importance have in a great measure passed .</p>
   <p>It is confidently hoped that the arrangements now made will give a completeness to the First Division of the Library Edition of the British Poets — from Chaucer to Cowper — which will be acceptable and satisfactory to the general reader .</p>

    <head>Very little is told us ( as usual in the beginnings of a literature ) of the life and private history of Gower , and that little is not specially authentic or clearly consistent with itself . His life consists mainly of a series of suppositions , with one or two firm facts between — like a few stepping-stones insulated in wide spaces of water . He is said to have been born about the year 1325 , and if so must have been a few years older than Chaucer ; whom he , however , outlived . He was a friend as well as contemporary of that great poet , who , in the fifth book of his ‘ Troilus and Cresseide , ’ thus addresses him :—</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ O moral Gower , this bookë I direct ,</l>
     <l n="2">To thee and the philosophical Strood ,</l>
     <l n="3">To vouchsafe where need is to correct ,</l>
     <l n="4">Of your benignities and zealës good . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Gower , on the other hand , in his ‘ Confessio Amantis , ’ through the mouth</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">‘ And greet well Chaucer when ye meet ,</l>
     <l n="8">As my disciple and my poët ;</l>
     <l n="9">For ‘ in the flower of his youth ,</l>
     <l n="10">In sundry wise , as he well couth ,</l>
     <l n="11">Of ditties and of songës glad ,</l>
     <l n="12">The whichë for my sake he made ,</l>
     <l n="13">The laud fulfill 'd is over all , ’ &amp; c .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The place of Gower 's birth has been the subject of much controversy . Caxton asserts that he was a native of Wales . Leland , Bales , Pits , Hollingshed , and Edmondson contend , on the other hand , that he belonged to the Statenham family , in Yorkshire . In proof of this , a deed is appealed to , which is preserved among the ancient records of the Marquis of Stafford . To this deed , of which the local date is Statenham , and the chronological 1346 , one of the subscribing witnesses is John Gower who on the back of the deed is stated , in the handwriting of at least a century later , to be ‘ Sr John Gower the Poet ’ . Whatever may be thought of this piece of evidence , ‘ the proud tradition , ’ adds Todd , who had produced it , ‘ in the Marquis of Stafford 's family has been , and still is , that the poet was of Statenham ; and who would not consider the dignity of his genealogy augmented by enrolling among its worthies the moral Gower ? ’</p>
   <p>From his will we know that he possessed the manor of Southwell , in the county of Nottingham , and that of Multon , in the county of Suffolk . He was thus a rich man , as well as probably a knight . The latter fact is inferred from the circumstance of his effigies in the church of St Mary Overies wearing a chaplet of roses , such as , says Francis Thynne , ‘ the knyghtes in old time used , either of gold or other embroiderye , made after the fashion of roses , one of the peculiar ornamentes of a knighte , as well as his collar of S. S. S ., his guilte sword and spurres . Which chaplett or circle of roses was as well attributed to knyghtes , the lowest degree of honor , as to the higher degrees of duke , erle , &amp; c ., being knyghtes , for so I have seen John of Gaunte pictured in his chaplett of roses ; and King , Edwarde the Thirde gave his chaplett to Eustace Rybamonte ; only the difference was , that as they were of lower degree , so had they fewer roses placed on their chaplett or cyrcle of golde , one ornament deduced from the dukes crowne , which had the roses upon the top of the cyrcle , when the knights had them only upon the cyrcle or garlande itself . ’</p>
   <p>It has been said that Gower as well as Chaucer studied in the Temple . This , however , Thynne doubts , on the ground that ‘ it is most certeyn to be gathered by cyrcumstances of recordes that the lawyers were not in the Temple until towardes the latter parte of the reygne of Kinge Edwarde the Thirde , at whiche tyme Chaucer was a grave manne , holden in greate credyt and employed in embassye ; ’ and when , of course , Gower , being his senior , must have been ‘ graver ’ still .</p>
   <p>There is scarcely anything more to relate of the personal career of our poet . In his elder days he became attached to the House of Lancaster , under Thomas of Woodstock , as Chaucer did under John of Gaunt . It is said that the two poets , who had been warm friends , at last quarrelled , but obscurity rests on the cause , the circumstances , the duration , and the consequences of the dispute . Gower , like some far greater bards , — Milton for instance , and those whom Milton has commemorated ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Blind Thamyris and blind Moeonides ,</l>
     <l n="2">And Tiresiaa and Phineus , prophets old , ’ —</l>
   </lg>
   <p>was sometime ere his death deprived of his sight , as we know on his own authority . It appears from his will that he was still living in 1408 , having outlived Chaucer eight years . This will is a curious document . It is that of a very rich and very superstitious Catholic , who leaves bequests to churches , hospitals , to priors , sub-priors , and priests , with the significant request ‘ ut orent pro me ’ — a request which , for the sake of the poor soul of the ‘ moral Gower , ’ was we trust devoutly obeyed , although we are irresistibly reminded of the old rhyme ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Pray for the soul of Gabriel John ,</l>
     <l n="2">Who died in the year one thousand and one ;</l>
     <l n="3">You may if you please , or let it alone ,</l>
     <l n="4">For it 's all one</l>
     <l n="5">To Gabriel John ,</l>
     <l n="6">Who died in the year one thousand and one . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>There is no mention of children in the will , and hence the assertion of Edmondson , who , in his genealogical table of the Statenham family , says that Thomas Gower , the governor of the castle of Mans in the times of the Fifth and Sixth Henrys , was the only son of the poet , and that of Glover , who , in his ‘ Visitation of Yorkshire , ’ describes Gower as married to a lady named Elizabeth , daughter of Sir Edward Sadbowrughe , Baron of the Exchequer , by whom he had five sons and three daughters , must both fall to the ground . According to the will , Gower 's wife 's name was Agnes , and he leaves to her £ 100 in legacy , besides his valuable goods and the rents accruing from his aforesaid manors of Multon , in Suffolk , and Southwell , in Nottinghamshire . His body was , according to his own direction , buried in the monastery of St Mary Overies , in Southwark , ( afterwards the church of St Saviour ,) where a monument , and an effigies , too , were erected , with the roses of a knight girdling the brow of one who was unquestionably a true , if not a great poet .</p>
   <p>In Warton 's ‘ History of English Poetry , ’ and in the ‘ Illustrations of the Lives and Writings of Gower and Chaucer ’ by Mr Todd , there will be found ample and curious details about MS. poems by Gower , such as fifty sonnets in French ; a ‘ Panegyrick on Henry IV ., ’ half in Latin and half in English , a short elegiac poem on the same subject , &amp; c .; besides a large work , entitled ‘ Speculum Meditantis , ’ a poem in French of a moral cast ; and ‘ Vox Clamantis , ’ consisting of seven books of Latin elegiacs , and chiefly filled with a metrical account of the insurrections of the Commons in the reign of Richard II . In the dedication of this latter work to Arundel , Archbishop of Canterbury , Gower speaks of his blindness and his age . He says , ‘ Hanc epistolam subscriptam corde devoto misit senex et cecus Johannes Gower reverendissimo in Christo patri ac domino suo precipuo domino Thome de Arundell , Cantuar . Archiepö . ’ &amp; c. Warton proves that the ‘ Vox Clamantis ’ was written in the year 1397 , by a line in the Bodleian manuscript of the poem , ‘ Hos ego bis deno Ricardo regis in anno . ’ Richard II . began , it is well known , to reign in the year 1377 , when ten years of age , and , of course , the year 1397 was the twentieth of his reign . It follows from this , that for eleven years at least before his death Gower had been senex et cecus , helpless through old age and blindness .</p>
   <p>The ‘ Confessio Amantis ’ is the only work of Gower 's which is printed and in English . The rest are still slumbering in MS .; and even although the ‘ Vox Clamantis ’ should put in a sleepy plea for the resurrection of print , on the whole we are disposed to say , better for all parties that it and the rest should slumber on . But the ‘ Confessio Amantis ’ is altogether a remarkable production . It is said to have been written at the command of Richard II ., who , meeting our poet rowing on the Thames , near London , took him on board the royal barge , and requested him to book some new thing . It is an English poem , in eight books , and was first printed by Caxton in the year 1483 . The ‘ Speculum Meditantis , ’ ‘ Vox Clamantis , ’ and ‘ Confessio Amantis , ’ are , properly speaking , parts of one great work , and are represented by three volumes upon Gower 's curious tomb in the old conventual church of St Mary Overies already alluded to — a church , by the way , which the poet himself assisted in rebuilding in the elegant shape which it retains to this day .</p>
   <p>The ‘ Confessio ’ is a large unwieldy collection of poetry and prose , superstition and science , love and religion , allegory and historical facts . It is crammed with all varieties of learning , and a perverse but infinite ingenuity is shewn in the arrangement of its heterogeneous materials . In one book the whole mysteries of the Hermetic philosophy are expounded , and the wonders of alchymy dazzle us in every page . In another , the poet scales the heights and sounds the depths of Aristotelianism . From this we have extracted in the ‘ Specimens ’ a glowing account of ‘ The Chariot of the Sun . ’ Throughout the work , tales and stories of every description and degree of merit are interspersed . These are principally derived from an old book called ‘ Pantheon ; or , Memoriae Seculorum , ’ — a kind of universal history , more studious of effect than accuracy , in which the author ranges over the whole history of the world , from the creation down to the year 1186 . This was a specimen of a kind of writing in which the Middle Ages abounded — namely , chronicles , which gradually superseded the monkish legends , and for a time eclipsed the classics themselves ; a kind of writing hovering between history and fiction , embracing the widest sweep , written in a barbarous style , and swarming with falsehoods ; but exciting , interesting , and often instructive , and tending to kindle curiosity , and create in the minds of their readers a love for literature .</p>
   <p>Besides chronicles , Gower had read many romances , and alludes to them in various parts of his works . His ‘ Confessio Amantis ’ was apparently written after Chaucer 's ‘ Troilus and Cresseide , ’ and after ‘ The Flower and the Leaf , ’ inasmuch as he speaks of the one and imitates the other in that poem . That Chaucer had not , however , yet composed his ‘ Testament of Love , ’ appears from the epilogue to the ‘ Confessio , ’ where Gower is ordered by Venus , who expresses admiration of Chaucer for the early devotion of his muse to her service , to say to him at the close —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Forthy , now in his daies old ,</l>
     <l n="2">Thou shalt him tell this message ,</l>
     <l n="3">That he upon his later age</l>
     <l n="4">To set an end of all his work ,</l>
     <l n="5">As he which is mine owen clerk ,</l>
     <l n="6">Do make his Testament of Love ,</l>
     <l n="7">As thou hast done thy shrift above ,</l>
     <l n="8">So that my court it may record ’ —</l>
   </lg>
   <p>the ‘ shrift ’ being of course the ‘ Confessio Amantis . ’ In ‘ The Canterbury Tales ’ there are several indications that Chaucer was indebted to Gower — ‘ The Man of Law 's Tale ’ being borrowed from Gower 's ‘ Constantia , ’ and ‘ The Wife of Bath 's Tale ’ being founded on Gower 's ‘ Florent . ’</p>
   <p>After all , Gower cannot be classed with the greater bards . He sparkles brightly chiefly from the depth of the darkness through which he shines . He is more remarkable for extent than for depth , for solidity than for splendour , for fuel than for fire , for learning than for genius .</p>

   <p>JOHN BARBOUR .</p>
   <p>The facts known about this Scottish poet are only the following . He seems to have been born about the year 1316 , in , probably , the city of Aberdeen . This is stated by Hume of Godscroft , by Dr Mackenzie , and others , but is not thoroughly authenticated . Some think he was the son of one Andrew Barbour , who possessed a tenement in Castle Street , Aberdeen ; and others , that he was related to one Robert Barbour , who , in 1309 , received a charter of the lands of Craigie , in Forfarshire , from King Robert the Bruce . These , however , are mere conjectures , founded upon a similarity of name . It is clear , from Barbour 's after rank in the Church , that he had received a learned education , but whether in Arbroath or Aberdeen is uncertain . We know , however , that a school of divinity and canon law had existed at Aberdeen since the reign of Alexander II ., and it is conjectured that Barbour first studied there , and then at Oxford . In the year 1357 , he was undoubtedly Archdeacon of Aberdeen , since we find him , under this title , nominated by the Bishop of that diocese , one of the Commissioners appointed to meet in Edinburgh to take measures to liberate King David , who had been captured at the battle of Nevil 's Cross , and detained from that date in England . It seems evident , from the customs of the Roman Catholic Church , that he must have been at least forty when he was created Archdeacon , and this is a good reason for fixing his birth in the year 1316 .</p>
   <p>In the same year , Barbour obtained permission from Edward III ., at the request of the Scottish King , to travel through England with three scholars who were to study at Oxford , probably at Balliol College , which had , a hundred years nearly before , been founded and endowed by the wife of the famous John Balliol of Scotland . Some years afterwards , in November 1364 , he got permission to pass , accompanied by four horsemen , through England , to pursue his studies at the same renowned university . In the year 1365 , we find another casual notice of our Scottish bard . A passport has been found giving him permission from the King of England to travel , in company with six horsemen , through that country on their way to St Denis ’ , and other sacred places . It is evident that this was a religious pilgrimage on the part of Barbour and his companions .</p>
   <p>A most peripatetic poet ; verily , he must have been ; for we find another safe-conduct , dated November 1368 , granted by Edward to Barbour , permitting him , to pass through England , with two servants and their horses , on his way to France , for the purpose of pursuing his studies there . Dr Jamieson ( see his ‘ Life of Barbour ’ ) discovers the poet 's name in the list of Auditors of the Exchequer .</p>
   <p>Barbour has himself told us that he commenced his poem in the ‘ yer of grace , a thousand thre hundyr sevynty and five , ’ when , of course , he was in his sixtieth year , or , as he says , ‘ off hys eld sexty . ’ It is supposed that David II .— who died in 1370 — had urged Barbour to engage in the work , which was not , however , completed till the fifth year of his successor , Robert II ., who gave our poet a pension on account of it . This consisted of a sum of ten pounds Scots from the revenues of the city of Aberdeen , and twenty shillings from the burgh mails . Mr James Bruce , to whose interesting Life of Barbour , in his ‘ Eminent Men of Aberdeen , ’ we are indebted for many of the facts in this narrative , says , ‘ The latter of these sums was granted to him , not merely during his own life , but to his assignees ; and the Archdeacon bequeathed it to the dean , canons , the chapter , and other ministers of the Cathedral of Aberdeen , on condition that they should for ever celebrate a yearly mass for his soul . At the Reformation , when it came to be discovered that masses did no good to souls in the other world , it is probable that this endowment reverted to the Crown . ’</p>
   <p>Barbour also wrote a poem under what seems now the strange title , ‘ The Brute . ’ This was in reality a metrical history of Scotland , commencing with the fables concerning Brutus , or ‘ Brute , ’ who , according to ancient legends , was the great-grandson of Aeneas — came over from Italy , the land of his birth — landed at Totness , in Devonshire — destroyed the giants who then inhabited Albion — called the island ‘ Britain ’ from his own name , and became its first monarch . From this original fable , Barbour is supposed to have wandered on through a hundred succeeding stories of similar value , till he came down to his own day . There can be little regret felt , therefore , that the book is totally lost . Wynton , in his ‘ Chronicle , ’ refers to it in commendatory terms ; but it cannot be ascertained from his notices whether it was composed in Scotch or in Latin .</p>
   <p>Barbour died about the beginning of the year 1396 , eighty years of age . Lord Hailes ascertained the time of his death from the Chartulary of Aberdeen , where , under the date of 10th August 1398 , mention is made of ‘ quondam Joh . Barber , Archidiaconus , Aberd ., and where it is said that he had died two years and a half before , namely , in 1396 . ’</p>
   <p>His great work , ‘ The Bruce , ’ or more fully , ‘ The History of Robert Bruce , King of the Scots , ’ does not appear to have been printed till 1616 in Edinburgh . Between that date and the year 1790 , when Pinkerton 's edition appeared , no less than twenty impressions were published , ( the principal being those of Edinburgh in 1620 and 1648 ; Glasgow , 1665 ; and Edinburgh , 1670 — all in black letter ,) so popular immediately became the poem . Pinkerton 's edition is in three volumes , and has a preface , notes , and a glossary , all of considerable value . The MS. was copied from a volume in the Advocates ’ Library , of the date of 1489 , which was in the handwriting of one John Ramsay , believed to have been the prior of a Carthusian monastery near Perth . Pinkerton first divided ‘ The Bruce ’ into books . It had previously , like the long works of Naerius and Ennius , the earliest Roman poets , consisted of one entire piece , woven ‘ from the top to the bottom without seam , ’ like the ancient simple garments in Jewry . The late respectable and very learned Dr Jamieson , of Nicolson Street United Secession Church , Edinburgh , well known as the author of the ‘ Scottish Dictionary , ’ ‘ Hermes Scythicus , ’ &amp; c ., published , in 1820 , a more accurate edition of ‘ The Bruce , ’ along with Blind Harry 's ‘ Wallace , ’ in two quarto volumes .</p>
   <p>In strict chronology Barbour belongs to an earlier date than Chaucer , having been born and having died a few years before him . But as the first Scotch poet who has written anything of length , with the exception of the author of the ‘ Romance of Sir Tristrem , ’ he claims a conspicuous place in our ‘ Specimens . ’ He was singularly fortunate in the choice of a subject . With the exception of Wallace , there is no name in Scottish history that even yet calls up prouder associations than that of Robert Bruce . The incidents in his history ,— the escape he made from English bondage to rescue his country from the same yoke ; his rise refulgent from the stroke which , in the cloisters of the Gray Friars , Dumfries , laid the Red Comyn low ; his daring to be crowned at Scone ; his frequent defeats ; his lion-like retreat to the Hebrides , accompanied by one or two friends , his wife meanwhile having been carried captive , three of his brothers hanged , and himself supposed to be dead ; the romantic perils he survived , and the victories he gained amidst the mountains where the deep waters of the river Awe are still telling of his name , and the echoes of Ben Cruachan repeating the immortal sound ; his sudden reappearance on the west coast of Scotland , where , as he ‘ shook his Carrick spear , ’ his country rose , kindling around him like heather on flame ; the awful suspense of the hour when it was announced that Edward I ., the tyrant of the Ragman 's Roll , the murderer of Wallace , was approaching with a mighty army to crush the revolt ; the electrifying news that he had died at Sark , as if struck by the breath of the fatal Border , which he had reached , but could not overpass ; the bloody summer 's day of Bannockburn , in which Edward II . was repelled , and the gallant army of his father annihilated ; the energy and wisdom of the Bruce 's civil administration after the victory ; the less famous , but noble battle of Byland , nine years after Bannockburn , in which he again smote the foes of his country ; and the recognition which at last he procured , on the accession of Edward III ., of the independence of Scotland in 1329 , himself dying the same year , his work done and his glory for ever secured ,— not to speak of the beautiful legends which have clustered round his history like ivy round an ancestral tower — of the spider on the wall , teaching him the lesson of perseverance , as he lay in the barn sad and desponding in heart — of the strange signal-light upon the shore near his maternal castle of Turnberry , which led him to land , while</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Dark red the heaven above it glow 'd ,</l>
     <l n="2">Dark red the sea beneath it flow 'd ,</l>
     <l n="3">Red rose the rocks on ocean 's brim ,</l>
     <l n="4">In blood-red light her islets swim ,</l>
     <l n="5">Wild screams the dazzled sea-fowl gave ,</l>
     <l n="6">Dropp 'd from their crags a plashing wave ,</l>
     <l n="7">The deer to distant covert drew ,</l>
     <l n="8">The blackcock deem 'd it day , and crew ; ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>and last , not least , the adventures of his gallant , unquenchable heart , when , in the hand of Douglas ,— meet casket for such a gem !— it marched onwards , as it was wont to do , in conquering power , toward the Holy Land ;— all this has woven a garland round the brow of Bruce which every civilised nation has delighted to honour , and given him besides a share in the affections and the pride of his own land , with the joy of which ‘ no stranger can intermeddle . ’</p>
   <p>Bruce has been fortunate in his laureates , consisting of three of Scotland 's greatest poets ,— Barbour , Scott , and Burns . The last of these has given us a glimpse of the patriot-king , revealing him on the brow of Bannockburn as by a single flash of lightning . The second has , in ‘ The Lord of the Isles , ’ seized and sung a few of the more romantic passages of his history . But Barbour has , with unwearied fidelity and no small force , described the whole incidents of Bruce 's career , and reared to his memory , not an insulated column , but a broad and deep-set temple of poetry .</p>
   <p>Barbour 's poem has always been admired for its strict accuracy of statement , to which Bower , Wynton , Hailes , Pinkerton , Jamieson , and Sir Walter Scott all bear testimony ; for the picturesque force of its natural descriptions ; for its insight into character , and the lifelike spirit of its individual sketches ; for the martial vigour of its battle - pictures ; for the enthusiasm which he feels , and makes his reader feel , for the valiant and wise , the sagacious and persevering , the bold , merciful , and religious character of its hero , and for the piety which pervades it , and proves that the author was not merely a churchman in profession , but a Christian at heart . Its defects of rude rhythm , irregular constructions , and obsolete phraseology , are those of its age ; but its beauties , its unflagging interest , and its fine poetic spirit , are characteristic of the writer 's own genius .</p>

    <head>ANDREW WYNTOUN .</head>
    <head>This author , who was prior of St Serf 's monastery in Loch Leven , is the author of what he calls ‘ An Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland . ’ It appeared about the year 1420 . It is much inferior to the work of Barbour in poetry , but is full of historical information , anecdote , and legend . The language is often sufficiently prosaic . Thus the poet begins to describe the return of King David II . from his captivity , referred to above .</head>
     <l n="1">‘ Yet in prison was king Davy ,</l>
     <l n="2">And when a lang time was gane bye ,</l>

   </lg>
   <p>Contemporary , or nearly so , with Wyntoun were several other Scottish writers , such as one Hutcheon , of whom we know only that he is designated of the ‘ Awle Ryall , ’ or of the Royal Hall or Palace , and that he wrote a metrical romance , of which two cantos remain , called ‘ The Gest of Arthur ; ’ and another , named Clerk of Tranent , the author of a romance , entitled ‘ The Adventures of Sir Gawain . ’ Of this latter also two cantos only are extant . Although not perhaps deserving to have even portions of them extracted , they contain a good deal of poetry . A person , too , of the name of Holland , about whose history we have no information , produced a satirical poem , called ‘ The Howlate , ’ written in the allegorical form , and bearing some resemblance to ‘ Pierce Plowman 's Vision . ’</p>

    <head>BLIND HARRY .</head>
    <head>Although there are diversities of opinion as to the exact time when this blind minstrel flourished , we prefer alluding to him at this point , where he stands in close proximity to Barbour , the author of a poem on a subject so cognate to ‘ Wallace ’ as ‘ Bruce . ’ Nothing is known of Harry but that he was blind from infancy , that he composed this poem , and gained a subsistence by reciting or singing portions of it through the country . Another Wandering Willie , ( see ‘ Redgauntlet , ’ ) he ‘ passed like night from land to land , ’ led by his own instincts , and wherever he met with a congenial audience , he proceeded to chant portions of the noble knight 's achievements , his eyes the while twinkling , through their sad setting of darkness , with enthusiasm , and often suffused with tears . In some minds the conception of this blind wandering bard may awaken ludicrous emotions , but to us it suggests a certain sublimity . Blind Harry has powerfully described Wallace standing in the light and shrinking from the ghost of Fawdoun , ( see the ‘ Battle of Black - Earnside , ’ in the ‘ Specimens , ’ ) but Harry himself seems walking in the light of the ghost of Wallace , and it ministers to him , not terror , but inspiration . Entering a cot at night , and asked for a tale , he begins , in low tones , to recite that frightful apparition at Gaskhall , and the aged men and the crones vie with the children in drawing near the ‘ ingle bleeze , ’ as if in fire alone lay the refuge from</head>

   <p>And while on the verge of the December sky , the wintry sun is trembling and about to set as if for ever , then is the Minstrel 's voice heard sobbing amidst the sobs of his hearers , as he tells how his hero 's sun went down while it was yet day .</p>

   <p>There can be little doubt that Blind Harry , during his lifetime , became a favourite , nay , a power in the realm . Wherever he circulated , there circulated the fame of Wallace ; there , his deeds were recounted ; there , hatred of a foreign foe , and love to their native land , were inculcated as first principles ; and long after the Homer of Scotland had breathed his last , and been consigned perhaps to some little kirkyard among the uplands , his lays continued to live ; and we know that such a man as Burns ( who read them in the modern paraphrase of William Hamilton of Gilbertfield , a book which was , till within a somewhat recent period , a household god in the libraries of the Scotch ) derived from the old singer much of ‘ that national prejudice which boiled in his breast till the floodgates of life shut in eternal rest . ’ If Barbour , as we said , was fortunate in his subject , still more was Blind Harry in his . The interest felt in Wallace is of a deeper and warmer kind than that which we feel in Bruce . Bruce was of royal blood ; Wallace was from an ancient but not wealthy family . Bruce stained his career by one great crime — great in itself , but greater from the peculiar notions of the age — the murder of Comyn in the sanctuary of Dumfries ; on the character of Wallace no similar imputation rests . Wallace initiated that plan of guerilla warfare ,— that fighting now on foot and now on the wing , now with beak and now with talons , now with horns and now with hoofs ,— which Bruce had only to perfect . Wallace was unsuccessful , and was besides treated by the King of England with revolting barbarity ; while Bruce became victorious : and , as we saw in our remarks on Chaucer , it is the unfortunate brave who stamp themselves most forcibly on a nation 's heart , and it is the red letters , which tell of suffering and death , which are with most difficulty erased from a nation 's tablets . On Bruce we look somewhat as we regard Washington ,— a great , serene man , who , after long reverses , nobly sustained , gained a notable national triumph ; to Wallace we feel , as the Italians do to Garibaldi , as a demon of warlike power ,— blending courage and clemency , enthusiasm and skill , daring and determination , in proportions almost superhuman ,— and we cry with the poet ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ The sword that seem 'd fit for archangel to wield ,</l>
     <l n="2">Was light in his terrible hand . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>We have often regretted that Sir Walter Scott , who , after all , has not done full justice to Bruce in that very unequal and incondite poem ‘ The Lord of the Isles , ’ had not bent his strength upon the Ulysses bow of Wallace , and filled up that splendid sketch of a part of his history to be found near the beginning of ‘ The Fair Maid of Perth . ’ As it is , after all that a number of respectable writers , such as Miss Porter , Mrs Hemans , Findlay , the late Mr Macpherson of Glasgow , and others , have done — in prose or verse , in the novel , the poem , or the drama — to illustrate the character and career of the Scottish hero , Blind Harry remains his poet .</p>
   <p>It is necessary to notice that Harry derived , by his own account , many of the facts of his narrative from a work by John Blair , a Benedictine monk from Dundee , who acted as Wallace 's chaplain , and seems to have composed a life of him in Latin , which is lost . Besides these , he doubtless mingled in the story a number of traditions — some true , and some false — which he found floating through the country . His authority in reference to certain disputed matters , such as Wallace 's journey to France , and his capture of the Red Rover , Thomas de Longueville , who became his fast friend and fellow-soldier , was not long ago entirely established by certain important documents brought to light by the Maitland Club . It is probable that some other of his supposed misstatements — always excepting his ghost-stories — may yet receive from future researches the confirmation they as yet want . Blind Harry , living about a century and a half after the era of Wallace , and at a time when tradition was the chief literature , was not likely to be able to test the evidence of many of the circumstances which he narrated ; but he seems to speak in good faith : and , after all , what Paley says is unquestionably true as a general principle — ‘ Men tell lies about minute circumstantials , but they rarely invent . ’</p>

   <p>JAMES I . OF SCOTLAND .</p>
   <p>Here we have a great ascent from our former subject of biography — from Blind Harry to James I .— from a beggar to a king . But in the Palace of Poetry there are ‘ many mansions , ’ and men of all ranks , climes , characters , professions , and we had almost added talents , have been welcome to inhabit there . For , even as in the House Beautiful , the weak Ready-to-halt and the timid Much-afraid were as cheerfully received as the strong Honest and the bold Valiant-for-truth ; so Poetry has inspired children , and seeming fools , and maniacs , and mendicants with the finest breath of her spirit . The ‘ Fable-tree ’ Fontaine is as immortal as Corneille ; Christopher Smart 's ‘ David ’ shall live as long as Milton 's ‘ Paradise Lost ; ’ and the rude epic of a blind wanderer , whose birth , parentage , and period of death are all alike unknown , shall continue to rank in interest with the productions of one who inherited that kingdom of Scotland , the independence of which was bought by the successive efforts and the blended blood of Wallace and Bruce .</p>
   <p>Let us now look for a moment at the history and the writings of this ‘ Royal Poet . ’ The name will suggest to all intelligent readers the title of one of the most pleasing papers in Washington Irving 's ‘ Sketch-book . ’ James I. was the son of Robert III . of Scotland ,— a character familiar to all from the admirable ‘ Fair Maid of Perth , ’ — and of Annabella Stewart . He was created Earl of Carrick ; and after the miserable death of the Duke of Rothesay , his elder brother , his father , apprehensive of the further designs of Albany , determined to send James to France , to find an asylum and receive his education in that friendly Court . On his way , the vessel was captured off Flamborough Head by an English cruiser , ( the 13th of March 1405 ,) and the young prince , with his attendants , was conveyed to London , and committed to the Tower . As there was a truce between the two nations at the time , this was a flagrant outrage on the law of nations , and has indelibly disgraced the memory of Henry IV ., who , when some one remonstrated with him on the injustice of the detention , replied , with cool brutality , ‘ Had the Scots been grateful , they ought to have sent the youth to me , for I understand French well . ’ Here for nineteen years ,— during the remainder of the life of Henry IV ., and the whole of the reign of Henry V .,— James continued . He was educated , however , highly , according to the fashion of these times , — instructed in the languages , as well as in music , painting , architecture , horticulture , dancing , fencing , poetry , and other accomplishments . Still it must have fretted his high spirit to be passing his young life in prison , while without horses were stamping , plumes glistening , trumpets sounding , tournaments waging , and echoes from the great victories of Henry V. in France ringing around . One sweetener of his solitude , however , he at length enjoyed . Having been transferred from the Tower to Windsor Castle , he beheld one day from its windows that beautiful vision he has described in ‘ The King 's Quhair , ’ ( see ‘ Specimens . ’ ) This was Lady Jane or Joanna Beaufort , daughter of the Earl of Somerset , niece of Richard II ., and grand-daughter of John of Gaunt , Duke of Lancaster . She was a lady of great beauty and accomplishments as well as of high rank , and James , even before he knew her name , became deeply enamoured . The passion was returned , and their mutual attachment had by and by an important bearing upon his prospects .</p>
   <p>In 1423 , the Duke of Bedford being now the English Regent , the friends of James renewed negotiations — often attempted before in vain — for his return to his native land , where his father had been long dead , and which , torn by factions and steeped in blood , was sorely needing his presence . Commissioners from the two kingdoms met at Pontefract on the 12th of May 1423 , when , in presence of the young King , and with his consent , matters were arranged . The English coolly demanded £ 40 , 000 to defray the expense of James 's nurture and education , ( as though a bill were handed in to a man who had been unjustly detained in prison on a false charge , ere he left its walls ,) insisted on the immediate departure of the Scots from France , where a portion of them were fighting in the French army , and procured the assent of the Scottish Privy Council to the marriage of James with his beloved Jane Beaufort . A truce , too , with Scotland was concluded for seven years . All this was settled ; and soon after , in the Church of St Mary Overies , Southwark , so often alluded to in the ‘ Life of Gower , ’ the happy pair were wed . It seemed a most auspicious event for both countries , and to augur the substitution of permanent peace for casual and temporary truces . To Lady Jane Beaufort it gave a crown , and a noble , gallant , and gifted prince to share it withal . On James it bestowed a lady of great beauty , who was regarded , too , with gratitude as having lightened the load of his captivity , and been a sunshine in his shady place , and — least consideration — who brought him a dowry of £ 10 , 000 , which was , in fact , a remission of the fourth part of his ransom .</p>
   <p>Attended by a magnificent retinue , the royal pair set out for Scotland . They were met at Durham by three hundred of the principal nobility and gentry , twenty-eight of whom were retained by the English as hostages for the national faith . Arrived on his native soil , James , at Melrose Abbey , gave his solemn assent on the Holy Gospels to the treaty ; and seldom have the Eildon Hills returned a louder and more joyous shout of acclamation than now welcomed back to the kingdom of his fathers the ‘ Royal Poet . ’ He proceeded to Edinburgh , where he celebrated Easter with great pomp , and a month later , he and his queen were solemnly crowned inthe Abbey Church at Scone . This was in 1424 . He lived after this only thirteen years ; but the period of his reign has always been thought a glorious interlude in the dark early history of Scotland . He set himself , with considerable success , to curb the exorbitant power of the nobles , sacrificing some of them , such as Albany , to his just indignation . He passed many useful regulations in reference to the coinage , the constitution , and the commerce of the country . He suppressed with a strong hand some of the gangs of robbers and ‘ sorners ’ which abounded , founding instead the order of Bedesmen or King 's Beggars , immortalised since in the character of Edie Ochiltree . He stretched a strong hand over the refractory Highland chieftains . While keeping at first on good terms with the English Court , he turned with a fonder eye to the French as the ancient allies of Scotland , and in 1436 gave his daughter Margaret in marriage to the Dauphin . This step roused the jealousy of his southern neighbours , who tried even to intercept the fleet that was conveying the bride across the Channel , whereupon James , stung to fury , proclaimed war against England , and in August commenced the siege of Roxburgh Castle . The castle , after being environed for fifteen days , was about to fall into his hands , when the Queen suddenly arrived in the camp , and communicated some information , probably referring to a threatened conspiracy of the nobles , which induced him to throw up the siege , disband his army , and return northward in haste . This unexpected step probably retarded , but could not prevent the dreadful purpose of death which had already been formed against the King .</p>
   <p>In October 1436 , he held his last Parliament in Edinburgh , in which , amidst many other enactments , we find , curiously enough , a prefiguration of the Forbes Mackenzie Act , in a decree that all taverns should be shut at nine o'clock . In the end of the year he determined on retiring to Perth , where ( in the language of Gibbon , applied to Timour ) ‘ he was expected by the Angel of Death . ’ It is said that , when about to cross the Frith of Forth , then called the Scottish Sea , a Highland woman , who claimed the character of a prophetess , like Meg Merrilees in fiction , met the cavalcade , and cried out , with a loud voice , ‘ My Lord the King , if you pass this water you shall never return again alive ; ’ but as she was concluded to be mad or drunk , her warning was scorned . He betook himself to the convent of the Black Friars , where Christmas was being celebrated with great pomp and splendour . Meanwhile Robert Grahame , and Walter , Earl of Athole , the King 's own uncle , actuated , the former by revenge on account of the resumption of some lands improperly granted to his family , and the latter by a desire to succeed to the Crown , had formed a plot against James 's life . Several warnings , besides that of the Highland seeress , the King received , but he heeded them not , and , like most of the doomed , was in unnaturally high spirits , as if the winding-sheet far up his breast had been a wedding-robe .</p>
   <p>It is the evening of the 20th of February 1437 . James and his nobles and ladies are seated at table till deep into the night , engaged in chess , music , and song . Athole , like another Judas , has supped with them , and gone out at a late hour . A tremendous knocking is heard at the gate . It is the Highland prophetess , who , having followed the monarch to Perth , is seeking to force her way into the room . The King tells her , through his usher , that he cannot receive her to-night , but will hear her tidings to-morrow . She retires reluctantly , murmuring that they will for ever rue their refusal to admit her into the royal presence . About an hour after this , James calls for the Voidee , or parting-cup , and the company disperse . Sir Robert Stewart , the chamberlain , who is in the confidence of the conspirators , is the last to retire , having previously destroyed the locks and removed the bars of the doors of the royal bed - chamber and the outer room adjoining . The King is standing before the fire , in his night-gown and slippers , and talking gaily with the Queen and her ladies , when torches are seen flashing up from the garden , and the clash of arms and the sound of angry voices is heard from below . A sense of the dread reality bursts on them in an instant . The Queen and the ladies run to secure the door of the chamber , while James , seizing the tongs , wrenches up one of the boards of the floor and takes refuge in a vault beneath . This was wont to have an opening to the outer court , but it had unfortunately been built up of late by his own orders . There , under the replaced boards , cowers the King , while the Queen and her women seek to barricade the door . One brave young lady , Catherine Douglas , thrusts her beautiful arm into the staple from which the bolt had been removed . It is broken in a moment , and she sinks back , to bear , with her descendants — a family well known in Scotland — the name of Barlass ever since . The murderers , who had previously killed in the passage one Walter Straiton , a page , rush in , with naked swords , wounding the ladies , striking , and well-nigh killing the Queen , and crying , with frantic imprecations , ‘ This is but a woman ! Where is James ? ’ Finding him not in the chamber , they leave it , and disperse through the neighbouring apartments in search .</p>
   <p>James , who had become wearied of his immurement , and thought the assassins were gone , calls now on one of the ladies to aid him in coming out of his place of concealment . But while this is being effected , one of the murderers returns . The cry , ‘ Found , found , ’ rings through the halls ; and after a violent but unarmed resistance , the King is , with circumstances of horrible barbarity , first mangled , then run through the body , and then despatched with daggers . In vain he offers half his kingdom for his life ; and when he seeks a confessor from Grahame , the ruffian replies , ‘ Thou shalt have no confessor but this sword . ’ It is satisfactory to know that the Queen made her escape , and that the criminals were punished , although the tortures they endured are such as human nature shrinks from conceiving , and history with a shudder records .</p>
   <p>We turn with pleasure from King James 's life and death to his poetry , although there is so little of it that a sentence or two will suffice . ‘ The King 's Quhair ’ is a poem conceived very much in the spirit , and written in the style of Chaucer , whose works were favourites with James . There is the same sympathy with nature , and the same perception of its relation to and unconscious sympathy with human feelings , and the same luscious richness in the description , alike of the early beauties of spring and of youthful feminine loveliness , although this seems more natural in the young poet James than in the sexagenarian author of ‘ The Canterbury Tales . ’ There is nothing even in Chaucer we think finer than the picture of Lady Jane Beaufort in the garden , particularly in the lines —</p>

   <p>Besides this precious little poem , King James is believed by some to have written several poems on Scottish subjects , such as ‘ Christis Kirk on the Green , ’ ‘ Peblis to the Play , ’ &amp; c ., but his claim to these is uncertain . The first describes the mingled merrymaking and contest common in the old rude marriages of Scotland , and , whether by James or not , is full of burly , picturesque force .</p>

   <p>Our readers will perceive the resemblance , both in spirit and in form of verse , between this old poem and the ‘ Holy Fair , ’ and other productions of Burns .</p>
   <p>James , cut off in the prime of life , may almost be called the abortive Alfred of Scotland . Had he lived , he might have made important contributions to her literature as well as laws , and given her a standing among the nations of Europe , which it took long ages , and even an incorporation with England , to secure . As it is , he stands high on the list of royal authors , and of those kings who , whether authors or not , have felt that nations cannot live on bread alone , and who have sought their intellectual culture as an object not inferior to their physical comfort . It is not , perhaps , too much to say , that no man or woman of genius has sate either on the Scotch or English throne since , except Cromwell , to whom , however , the term ‘ genius , ’ in its common sense , seems ludicrously inadequate . James V. had some of the erratic qualities of the poetic tribe , but his claim to the songs — such as the ‘ Gaberlunzie Man ’ — which go under his name , is exceedingly doubtful . James VI . was a pedant , without being a scholar — a rhymester , not a poet . Of the rest we need not speak . Seldom has the sceptre become an Aaron 's rod , and flourished with the buds and blossoms of song . In our annals there has been one , and but one ‘ Royal Poet . ’</p>

   <p>JOHN THE CHAPLAIN — THOMAS OCCLEVE .</p>
   <p>The first of these is the only versifier that can be assigned to England in the reign of Henry IV . His name was John Walton , though he was generally known as Johannes Capellanus or ‘ John the Chaplain . ’ He was canon of Oseney , and died sub-dean of York . He , in the year 1410 , translated Boethius ’ famous treatise , ‘ De Consolatione Philosophiae , ’ into English verse . He is not known to have written anything original . — Thomas Occleve appeared in the reign of Henry V ., about 1420 . Like Chaucer and Gower , he was a student of municipal law , having attended Chester 's Inn , which stood on the site of the present Somerset House ; but although he trod in the footsteps of his celebrated predecessors , it was with far feebler powers . His original pieces are contemptible , both in subject and in execution . His best production is a translation of ‘ Egidius De Regimine Principum . ’ Warton , alluding to the period at which these writers appeared , has the following oft-quoted observations : — ‘ I consider Chaucer as a genial day in an English spring . A brilliant sun enlivens the face of nature with an unusual lustre ; the sudden appearance of cloudless skies , and the unexpected warmth of a tepid atmosphere , after the gloom and the inclemencies of a tedious winter , fill our hearts with the visionary prospect of a speedy summer , and we fondly anticipate a long continuance of gentle gales and vernal serenity . But winter returns with redoubled horrors ; the clouds condense more formidably than before , and those tender buds and early blossoms which were called forth by the transient gleam of a temporary sunshine , are nipped by frosts and torn by tempests . ’ These sentences are , after all , rather pompous , and express , in the most verbose style of the Rambler , the simple fact , that after Chaucer 's death the ground lay fallow , and that for a while in England ( in Scotland it was otherwise ) there were few poets , and little poetry .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>JOHN LYDGATE .</head>
    <head>This copious and versatile writer flourished in the reign of Henry VI . Warton affirms that he reached his highest point of eminence in 1430 , although some of his poems had appeared before . He was a monk of the Benedictine Abbey at Bury , in Suffolk . He received his education at Oxford ; and when it was finished , he travelled through France and Italy , mastering the languages and literature of both countries , and studying their poets , particularly Dante , Boccaccio , and Alain Chartier . When he returned , he opened a school in his monastery for teaching the sons of the nobility composition and the art of versification . His acquirements were , for the age , universal . He was a poet , a rhetorician , an astronomer , a mathematician , a public disputant , and a theologian . He was born in 1370 , ordained sub-deacon in 1389 , deacon in 1393 , and priest in 1397 . The time of his death is uncertain . His great patron was Humphrey , Duke of Gloucester , to whom he complains sometimes of necessitous circumstances , which were , perhaps , produced by indulgence , since he confesses himself to be ‘ a lover of wine . ’</head>
     <l n="1">The great merit of Lydgate is his versatility . This Warton has happily</l>
     <l n="2">expressed in a few sentences , which we shall quote :—</l>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ He moves with equal ease in every form of composition . His hymns and his ballads have the same degree of merit ; and whether his subject be the life of a hermit or a hero , of Saint Austin or Guy , Earl of Warwick , ludicrous or legendary , religious or romantic , a history or an allegory , he writes with facility . His transitions were rapid , from works of the most serious and laborious kind , to sallies of levity and pieces of popular entertainment . His muse was of universal access ; and he was not only the poet of his monastery , but of the world in general . If a disguising was intended by the Company of Goldsmiths , a mask before His Majesty at Eltham , a May game for the sheriffs and aldermen of London , a mumming before the Lord Mayor , a procession of pageants , from the “ Creation , ” for the Festival of Corpus Christi , or a carol for the coronation , Lydgate was consulted , and gave the poetry . ’</p>
   <p>Lydgate is , so far as we know , the first British bard who wrote for hire . At the request of Whethamstede , the Abbot of St Alban 's , he translated a ‘ Life of St Alban ’ from Latin into English rhymes , and received for the whole work one hundred shillings . His principal poems , all founded on the works of other authors , are the ‘ Fall of Princes , ’ the ‘ Siege of Thebes , ’ and the ‘ Destruction of Troy . ’ They are written in a diffuse and verbose style , but are generally clear in sense , and often very luxuriant in description . ‘ The London Lyckpenny ’ is a fugitive poem , in which the author describes himself coming up to town in search of legal redress for a wrong , and gives some curious particulars of the condition of that city in the early part of the fifteenth century .</p>

   <p>John Harding flourished about the year 1403 . He fought at the battle of Shrewsbury on the Percy side . He is the author of a poem entitled ‘ The Chronicle of England unto the Reign of King Edward the Fourth , in Verse . ’ It has no poetic merit , and little interest , except to the antiquary . In the reign of the above king we find the first mention of a Poet Laureate . John Kay was appointed by Edward , when he returned from Italy , Poet Laureate to the king , but has , perhaps fortunately for the world , left behind him no poems . Would that the same had been the case with some of his successors in the office ! There is reason to believe , that for nearly two centuries ere this date , there had existed in the court a personage , entitled the King 's Versifier , ( versificator ,) to whom one hundred shillings a-year was the salary , and that the title was , by and by , changed to that of Poet Laureate , i. e ., Laurelled Poet . It had long been customary in the universities to crown scholars when they graduated with laurel , and Warton thinks that from these the first poet laureates were selected , less for their general genius than for their skill in Latin verse . Certainly the earliest of the Laureate poems , such as those by Baston and Gulielmus , who acted as royal poets to Richard I. and Edward II ., and wrote , the one on Richard 's Crusade , and the other on Edward 's Siege of Stirling Castle , are in Latin . So too are the productions of Andrew Bernard , who was the Poet Laureate successively to Henry VII . and Henry VIII . It was not till after the Reformation had lessened the superstitious veneration for the Latin tongue that the laureates began to write in English . It is almost a pity , we are sometimes disposed to think , that , in reference to such odes as those of Pye , Whitehead , Colley Cibber , and even some of Southey 's , the old practice had not continued ; since thus , in the first place , we might have had a chance of elegant Latinity , in the absence of poetry and sense ; and since , secondly , the deficiencies of the laureate poems would have been disguised , from the general eye at least , under the veil of an unknown tongue . It is curious to notice about this period the uprise of two didactic poets , both writing on alchymy , the chemistry of that day , and neither displaying a spark of genius . These are John Norton and George Ripley , both renowned for learning and knowledge of their beloved occult sciences . Their poems , that by Norton , entitled ‘ The Ordinal , ’ and that by Ripley , entitled ‘ The Compound of Alchemie , ’ are dry and rugged treatises , done into indifferent verse . One rather fine fancy occurs in the first of these . It is that of an alchymist who projected a bridge of gold over the Thames , near London , crowned with pinnacles of gold , which , being studded with carbuncles , should diffuse a blaze of light in the dark ! Alchymy has had other and nobler singers than Ripley and Norton . It has , as Warton remarks , ‘ enriched the store - house of Arabian romance with many magnificent imageries . ’ It is the inspiration of two of the noblest romances in this or any language — ‘ St. Leon ’ and ‘ Zanoni . ’ And its idea , transfigured into a transcen - dental form , gave light and life and fire , and the loftiest poetry , to the eloquence of the lamented Samuel Brown , whose tongue , as he talked on his favourite theme , seemed transmuted into gold ; nay , whose lips , like the touch of Midas , seemed to create the effects of alchymy upon every subject they approached , and upon every heart over which they wielded their sorcery .</p>
   <p>We pass now from this comparatively barren age in the history of English poetry to a cluster of Scottish bards . The first of these is ROBERT HENRYSON . He was schoolmaster at Dunfermline , and died some time before 1508 . He is supposed by Lord Hailes to have been preceptor of youth in the Benedictine convent in that place . He is the author of ‘ Robene and Makyne , ’ a pastoral ballad of very considerable merit , and of which Campbell says , somewhat too warmly , ‘ It is the first known pastoral , ’ ( he means in the Scottish language of course ,) ‘ and one of the best , in a dialect rich with the favours of the pastoral muse . ’ He wrote also a sequel to Chaucer 's ‘ Troilus and Cresseide ’ entitled ‘ The Testament of Cresseide , ’ and thirteen Fables , of which copies , in MS ., are preserved in the Advocates ’ Library , Edinburgh . One of these , ‘ The Town and Country Mouse , ’ tells that old story with considerable spirit and humour . ‘ The Garment of Good Ladies ’ is an ingenious and beautiful strain , written in that quaint style of allegorising which continued popular as far down as the days of Cowley , and even later .</p>

   <p>Foster , in an entry in his journal , ( we quote from memory ,) says , ‘ I have just seen the moon rising , and wish the impression to be eternal . What a look she casts upon earth , like that of a celestial being who loves our planet still , but has given up all hope of ever doing her any good or seeing her become any better — so serene she seems in her settled and unutterable sadness . ’ Such , we have often fancied , was the feeling of the great Florentine toward the world , and which — pained , pitying , yearning enthusiast that he was !— escaped irresistibly from those deep - set eyes , that adamantine jaw , and that brow , wearing the laurel , proudly yet painfully , as if it were a crown of everlasting fire ! Dunbar was not altogether a Dante , either in melancholy or in power , but his ‘ Dance ’ reveals kindred moods , operating at times on a kindred genius .</p>
   <p>In Dante humour existed too , but ere it could come up from his deep nature to the surface , it must freeze and stiffen into monumental scorn — a laughter that seemed , while mocking at all things else , to mock at its own mockery most of all . Aird speaks in his ‘ Demoniac , ’ of a smile upon his hero 's brow ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Like the lightning of a hope about to DIE</l>
     <l n="2">For ever from the furrow 'd brows of Hell 's Eternity . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Dante 's smile may rather be compared to the RISING of a false and self - detected hope upon the lost brows where it is never to come to dawn , and where , nevertheless , it remains for ever , like a smile carved upon a sepulchre . Dunbar has a more joyous disposition than his Italian prototype and master , and he indulges himself to the top of his bent , but in a style ( particularly in his ‘ Twa Married Women and the Widow , ’ and in ‘ The Friars of Berwick , ’ which is not , however , quite certainly his ) too coarse and prurient for the taste of this age .</p>
   <p>‘ The Merle and the Nightingale ’ is one of the finest of Moelibean poems . Beautiful is the contest between the two sweet singers as to whether the love of man or the love of God be the nobler , and more beautiful still their reconciliation , when</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ Then sang they both with voices loud and clear ,</l>
     <l n="2">The Merle sang , “ Man , love God that has thee wrought . ”</l>
     <l n="3">The Nightingale sang , “ Man , love the Lord most dear ,</l>
     <l n="4">That thee and all this world made of nought . ”</l>
     <l n="5">The Merle said , “ Love him that thy love has sought</l>
     <l n="6">From heaven to earth , and here took flesh and bone . ”</l>
     <l n="7">The Nightingale sang . “ And with his death thee bought :</l>
     <l n="8">All love is lost , but upon him alone . ”</l>
    </lg>

   <p>William Dunbar is said to have been born about the year 1465 . He received his education at St Andrews , and took there the degree of M. A . in 1479 . He became then a friar of the Franciscan order , ( Grey Friars ,) and in the exercise of his profession seems to have rambled over all Scotland , England , and France , preaching , begging , and , according to his own confession , cheating , lying , and cajoling . Yet if this kind of life was not propitious , in his case , to morality , it must have been to the development of the poetic faculty . It enabled him to see all varieties of life and of scenery , although here and there , in his verses , you find symptoms of that bitterness which is apt to arise in the heart of a wanderer . He was subsequently employed by James IV . in some official work connected with various foreign embassies , which led him to Spain , Italy , and Germany , as well as England and France . This proves that he was no less a man of business-capacity and habits than a poet . For these services he , in 1500 , received from the King a pension of ten pounds , afterwards increased to twenty , and , in fine , to eighty . He is said to have been employed in the negotiations preparatory to the marriage of James with Margaret Tudor , daughter of Henry VII ., which took place in 1503 , and which our poet celebrated in his verses , ‘ The Thistle and the Rose . ’ He continued ever afterwards in the Court , hovering in position between a laureate and a court-fool , charming James with his witty conversation as well as his verses , but refused the benefices for which he petitioned , and gradually devoured by chagrin and disappointment . Seldom has genius so great been placed in a falser position , and this has given a querulous tinge to many of his poems . He seems to have died about 1520 . Even after his death , misfortune pursued him . His works were , with the exception of two or three pieces , locked up in an obscure MS. till the middle of last century . Since then , however , their fame has been still increasing . In 1834 , Mr David Laing , so favourably known as one of our first antiquarians , published a complete and elaborate edition of Dunbar 's works ; and in a newspaper this very day ( May 23 ) we see another edition announced , in a popular and modernised shape , of the poetry of this great old Scottish Makkar .</p>

    <head>GAVIN DOUGLAS .</head>
    <head>This eminent prelate was a younger son of Archibald , the fifth Earl of Angus . He was born in Brechin about the year 1474 . He studied at the University of Paris . He became a churchman , and yet united with attention to the duties of his calling great proficiency in polite learning . In 1513 he finished a translation , into Scottish verse , of Virgil 's ‘ Aeneid , ’ which , considering the age , is an extraordinary performance . It occupied him only sixteen months . The multitude of obsolete terms , however , in which it abounds , renders it now , as a whole , illegible . After passing through various subordinate offices , such as the ‘ Provostship ’ of St Giles 's , Edinburgh , and the ‘ Abbotship ’ of Arbroath , he was at length appointed Bishop of Dunkeld . Dunkeld was not then the paradise it has become , but Birnam hill and the other mountains then , as now , stood round about it , the old Cathedral rose up in mediaeval majesty , and the broad , smooth Tay flowed onward to the ocean . And , doubtless , Douglas felt the poetic inspiration from it quite as warmly as did Thomas Brown , when , three centuries afterwards , he set up the staff of his summer rest at the beautiful Invar inn , and thence delighted to diverge to the hundred scenes of enchantment which stretch around . The good Bishop was an ardent politician as well as a poet , and was driven , by his share in the troubles of the times , to flee from his native land , and take refuge in the Court of Henry VIII . The King received him kindly , and treated him with much liberality . In 1522 he died at London of the plague , and was interred in the Savoy Church . He was , according to Buchanan , about to proceed to Rome to vindicate himself before the Pope against certain charges brought by his enemies . Besides the translation of the ‘ Aeneid , ’ Douglas is the author of a long poem entitled the ‘ Palace of Honour ; ’ it is an allegory , describing a large company making a pilgrimage to Honour 's Palace . It bears considerable resemblance to the ‘ Pilgrim 's Progress , ’ and some suppose that Bunyan had seen it before composing his allegory . ‘ King Hart ’ is another production of our poet 's , of considerable length and merit . It gives , metaphorically , a view of human life . Perhaps his best pieces are his ‘ Prologues , ’ affixed to each book of the ‘ Aeneid . ’ From them we have selected ‘ Morning in May ’ as a specimen . The closing lines are fine .</head>
     <l n="1">‘ Welcome the lord of light , and lamp of day ,</l>
     <l n="2">Welcome fosterer of tender herbis green ,</l>
     <l n="3">Welcome quickener of flourish 'd flowers sheen ,</l>
     <l n="4">Welcome support of every root and vein ,</l>
     <l n="5">Welcome comfort of all kind fruit and grain , ’ &amp; c .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Douglas must not be named with Dunbar in strength and grandeur of genius . His power is more in expression than in conception , and hence he has shone so much in translation . His version of the ‘ Aeneid ’ is the first made of any classic into a British tongue , and is the worthy progenitor of such minor miracles of poetical talent — all somewhat more mechanical than inspired , and yet giving a real , though subordinate glory to our literature-as Fairfax 's ‘ Tasso , ’ Dryden 's ‘ Virgil , ’ and Pope 's , Coper 's , and Sotheby 's ‘ Homer . ’ The fire in Douglas ’ original verses is occasionally lost in smoke , and the meaning buried in flowery verbiage . Still he was an honour alike to the Episcopal bench and the Muse of Scotland . He was of amiable manners , gentle temperament , and a noble and commanding appearance .</p>

     <l n="173">HAWES , BARCLAY , &amp; c .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Stephen Hawes , a native of Suffolk , wrote about the close of the fifteenth century . He studied at Oxford , and travelled much in France , where he became a master of French and Italian poetry . King Henry VII ., struck with his conversation and the readiness with which he repeated old English poets , especially Lydgate , created him groom of the privy chamber . Hawes has written a number of poems , such as ‘ The Temple of Glasse , ’ ‘ The Conversion of Swearers , ’ ‘ The Consolation of Lovers , ’ ‘ The Pastime of Pleasure , ’ &amp; c. Those who wish to see specimens of the strange allegories and curious devices of thought in which it abounds , may find them in Warton 's ‘ History of English Poetry . ’</p>
   <p>In that same valuable work we find an account of Alexander Barclay , author of ‘ The Ship of Fools . ’ He was educated at Oriel College in Oxford , and after travelling abroad , was appointed one of the priests or prebendaries of the College of St Mary Ottery , in Devonshire — a parish famous in later days for the birth of Coleridge . Barclay became afterwards a Benedictine monk of Ely monastery ; and at length a brother of the Order of St Francis , at Canterbury . He died , a very old man , at Croydon , in Surrey , in the year 1552 . His principal work , ‘ The Ship of Fools , ’ is a satire upon the vices and absurdities of his age , and shews considerable wit and power of sarcasm .</p>
   <p>SKELTON .</p>
   <p>John Skelton is the name of the next poet . He flourished in the earlier part of the reign of Henry VIII . Having studied both at Oxford and Cambridge , and been laureated at the former university in 1489 , he was promoted to the rectory of Diss or Dysse , in Norfolk . Some say he had acted previously as tutor to Henry VIII . At Dysse he attracted attention by satirical ballads against the mendicants , as well as by licences of buffoonery in the pulpit . For these he was censured , and even , it is said , suspended , by Nykke , Bishop of Norwich . Undaunted by this , he flew at higher game — ventured to ridicule Cardinal Wolsey , then in his power , and had to take refuge from the myrmidons of the prelate in Westminster Abbey . There Abbot Islip kindly entertained and protected him till his dying day . He breathed his last in the year 1529 , and was buried in the adjacent church of St Margaret 's .</p>
   <p>Skelton as well as Barclay enjoyed considerable popularity in his own age . Erasmus calls him ‘ Britannicarum literarum lumen et decus ! ’ How dark must have been the night in which such a Will-o ’ - wisp was mistaken for a star ! He has wit , indeed , and satirical observation ; but his wit is wilder than it is strong , and his satire is dashed with personality and obscenity . His style , Campbell observes , is ‘ almost a texture of slang phrases , patched with shreds of French and Latin . ’ His verses on Margaret Hussey , which we have quoted , are in his happiest vein . The following lines , too , on Cardinal Wolsey , are as true as they are terse :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Then in the Chamber of Stars</l>
     <l n="2">All matter there he mars .</l>
     <l n="3">Clapping his rod on the board ,</l>
     <l n="4">No man dare speak a word .</l>
     <l n="5">For he hath all the saying ,</l>
     <l n="6">Without any renaying .</l>
     <l n="7">He rolleth in his recòrds ;</l>
     <l n="8">He sayeth , How say ye , my Lords ?</l>
     <l n="9">Is not my reason good ?</l>
     <l n="10">Good even , good Robin Hood .</l>
     <l n="11">Some say , Yes ; and some</l>
     <l n="12">Sit still , as they were dumb . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It is curious that Wolsey 's enemies , in one of their charges against him in the Parliament of 1529 , have repeated , almost in the words of Skelton , the same accusation .</p>

    <head>SIR DAVID LYNDSAY .</head>
    <head>Returning to Scotland , we find a Skelton of a higher order and a brawnier make in Sir David Lyndsay , or , as our forefathers were wont familiarly to denominate him , ‘ Davie Lyndsay . ’ Lyndsay was descended from a noble family , a younger branch of Lyndsay of the Byres , and born in 1490 , probably at the Mount , the family-seat , near Cupar-Fife . He entered the University of St Andrews in the year 1505 , and four years later left it to travel in Italy . He must , however , have returned to Scotland before the 12th of October 1511 , since we learn from the records of the Lord Treasurer that he was presented with a quantity of ‘ blue and yellow taffety to be a playcoat for the play performed in the King and Queen 's presence in the Abbey of Holyrood . ’ On the 12th of April 1512 , Lyndsay , then twenty-two years of age , was appointed gentleman-usher to James V ., who had been born that very day . In his poem called ‘ The Dream , ’ he reminds the King of his having borne him in his arms ere he could walk ; of having wrapped him up warmly in his little bed ; of having sung to him with his lute , danced before him to make him laugh , and having carried him on his shoulders like a ‘ pedlar his pack . ’ He continued to be page and companion to the King till 1524 , when , in consequence of the unprincipled machinations of the Queen - mother — who was acting as Regent — he , as well as Bellenden , the learned translator of Livy and Boece , was ejected from his office . When , however , in 1528 , the young King , by a noble effort , emancipated himself from the thraldom of his mother and the Douglasses , Lyndsay wrote his ‘ Dream , ’ in which , amidst much poetic or fantastic matter , he congratulates James on his deliverance ; reminds him , as aforesaid , of his early services ; and takes occasion to paint the evils the country had endured during his minority , and to give him some bold and salutary advice as to his future conduct . The next year ( 1529 ) he produced ‘ The Complaint , ’ a poem in which he recurs to former themes , and remonstrates with great freedom and severity against the treatment he had undergone . Here , too , the religious reformer peeps out . He exhorts the King to compel the clergy to attend to the duties of their office ; to preach more earnestly ; to administer the sacraments according to the institution of Christ ; and not to deceive their people with superstitious pilgrimages , vain traditions , and prayers to graven images , contrary to the written command of God . He with quaint iron says , that if his Grace will lend him</head>
     <l n="1">‘ Of gold ane thousand pound or tway , ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>he will give him a sealed bond , obliging himself to repay the loan when the Bass and the Isle of May are set upon Mount Sinai ; or the Lomond hills , near Falkland , are removed to Northumberland ; or</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ When kirkmen yairnis [ desire ] na dignity ,</l>
     <l n="2">Nor wives na soveranitie . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">Still finer the last lines of the poem . ‘ If not , ’ he says , ‘ my God</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">‘ Shall cause me stand content</l>
     <l n="5">With quiet life and sober rent ,</l>
     <l n="6">And take me , in my latter age ,</l>
     <l n="7">Unto my simple hermitage ,</l>
     <l n="8">To spend the gear my elders won ,</l>
     <l n="9">As did Diogenes in his tun . ’</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>This ‘ Complaint ’ proved successful , and in the next year ( 1530 ) Lyndsay was appointed Lion King-at-Arms — an office of great dignity in these days . The Lion was the chief judge of all matters connected with heraldry in the realm ; was also the official ambassador from his sovereign to foreign countries ; and was inaugurated in his office with a pomp and circumstance little inferior to those of a royal coronation , the King crowning him with his own hands , anointing him with wine instead of oil , and putting on his head the Royal Crown of Scotland , which he continued to wear till the close of the feast . It is of Lyndsay in the full accoutrements of this office that Sir Walter Scott speaks in his ‘ Marmion , ’ although he antedates by sixteen years the time when he assumed it :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ He was a man of middle age ,</l>
     <l n="2">In aspect manly , grave , and sage ,</l>
     <l n="3">As on king 's errand come ;</l>
     <l n="4">But in the glances of his eye ,</l>
     <l n="5">A penetrating , keen , and sly</l>
     <l n="6">Expression found its home —</l>
     <l n="7">The flash of that satiric rage</l>
     <l n="8">Which , bursting on the early stage ,</l>
     <l n="9">Branded the vices of the age ,</l>
     <l n="10">And broke the keys of Rome .</l>
     <l n="11">On milk-white palfrey forth he paced ;</l>
     <l n="12">His cap of maintenance was graced</l>
     <l n="13">With the proud heron-plume ;</l>
     <l n="14">From his steed 's shoulder , loin , and breast</l>
     <l n="15">Silk housings swept the ground ,</l>
     <l n="16">With Scotland 's arms , device , and crest</l>
     <l n="17">Embroider 'd round and round .</l>
     <l n="18">The double treasure might you see ,</l>
     <l n="19">First by Achaius borne ,</l>
     <l n="20">The thistle and the fleur-de-lis ,</l>
     <l n="21">And gallant unicorn .</l>
     <l n="22">So bright the king 's armorial coat ,</l>
     <l n="23">That scarce the dazzled eye could note ;</l>
     <l n="24">In living colours , blazon 'd brave ,</l>
     <l n="25">The lion , which his title gave .</l>
     <l n="26">A train which well beseem 'd his state ,</l>
     <l n="27">But all unarm 'd , around him wait ;</l>
     <l n="28">Still is thy name in high account ,</l>
     <l n="29">And still thy verse has charms ,</l>
     <l n="30">Sir David Lyndsay of the Mount ,</l>
     <l n="31">Lord Lion King-at-Arms . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Soon after this appointment , Lyndsay wrote ‘ The Complaint of the King 's Papingo , ’ in which , through the mouth of a dying parrot , he gives some sharp counsel to the king , his courtiers and nobles , and administers severe satirical chastisement to the corruptions of the clergy . It is an exceedingly clever production , and has some beautiful poetry as well as stinging sarcasm . Take the following address to Edinburgh , Stirling , Linlithgow , and Falkland :—</p>

     <l n="20">In the year 1535 , Lyndsay wrote his remarkable drama , ‘ The Satire of the</l>
     <l n="21">Three Estates ’ — Monarch , namely , Barons , and Clergy . It is made up in</l>
     <l n="22">nearly three equal parts of ingenuity , wit , and grossness . It is a drama ,</l>
     <l n="23">and was acted several times — first , in 1535 , at Cupar-Fife , on a large</l>
     <l n="24">green mound called Moot-hill ; then , in 1539 , in an open park near</l>
     <l n="25">Linlithgow , by the express desire of the king , who with all the ladies</l>
     <l n="26">of the Court attended the representation ; then in the amphitheatre of</l>
     <l n="27">St Johnston in Perth ; and in 1554 , at Edinburgh , in the village of</l>
     <l n="28">Greenside , which skirted the northern base of the Calton Hill , in the</l>
     <l n="29">presence of the Queen Regent and an enormous concourse of spectators .</l>
     <l n="30">Its exhibition appears to have occupied nearly the whole day . In the</l>
     <l n="31">‘ Pictorial History of Scotland , ’ chapter xxiv ., our readers will find a</l>
     <l n="32">full and able analysis with extracts of this extraordinary performance .</l>
     <l n="33">It is said to have done much good in opening the eyes of the people to</l>
     <l n="34">the evils of the Papacy , and in paving the way for the Reformation .</l>

   <p>In 1536 Sir David , in company with Sir John Campbell of Lundie , was sent to the Court of France to demand in marriage for James V. a daughter of the House of Vendome ; but the King chose rather to take the matter in his own hands , and , going over in person , wedded Magdalene , daughter of Francis . She died two months after her arrival in Scotland , universally regretted ; and Lyndsay made the sad event the subject of a poem , entitled ‘ Deploration of the Death of Queen Magdalene , ’ whom he designates</p>
   <p>‘ The flower of France , and comfort of Scotland . ’</p>
   <p>When James subsequently married Mary of Guise , Sir David 's ingenuity was strained to the utmost in providing pageants , masques , and shows to welcome her Majesty . For forty days in St Andrews , festivities continued ; and it was during this prolonged festival that the Lion King , as if sick and satiated with vanities , wrote two poems , one entitled ‘ The Justing between James Watson and John Barbour , ’ a dull satire on tournaments , &amp; c ., and the other a somewhat cleverer piece , entitled ‘ Supplication directed to the King 's Grace in Contemptioun of Side Tails , ’ the long trains then worn by the ladies . It met , we presume , with the fate of Punch 's sarcasms against crinoline ,— the ‘ phylacteries ’ would for a season , instead of being lessened , be enlarged , till Fashion lifted up her omnipotent rod , and told it to be otherwise .</p>
   <p>King James died prematurely on the 14th of December 1542 , and Lyndsay closed his eyes at Falkland , and mourned for him as a brother . From that day forth he probably felt that there was ‘ less sunshine in the sky for him . ’ In the troublous times which succeeded this , he had to retire for a season from the Court , having become obnoxious to the rigid Papists on account of his writings . After the death of Cardinal Beatoun he wrote the tragedy of ‘ The Cardinal , ’ a poem in which the spectre of the Cardinal is the spokesman , and which teems with good advice to all and sundry . The execution , however , is not so felicitous as the plan . In 1548 Lyndsay went to Denmark to negotiate a free trade with Scotland . On his return in 1550 he wrote his very pleasing and chivalric ‘ History of Squire Meldrum , ’ founded on the actual adventures of William Meldrum , the Laird of Cleish and Binns , a distinguished friend of the poet , who had gained laurels as a warrior both in Scotland and in France . This poem is , in a measure , an anticipation of the rhymed romances of Scott , and is full of picturesque description and spirit-stirring adventure . In 1553 he completed his last and most elaborate work , which had occupied him for years , entitled ‘ The Monarchic , ’ containing an account of the most famous monarchies which have existed on earth , and carrying on the history to the general judgment . From this date we almost entirely lose sight of our poet . He seems to have retired into private life , and is supposed to have died about the close of 1557 . He was probably buried in the family vault at Ceres , but no stone marks the spot . Dying without issue , his estates passed to his brother Alexander , and were continued in the possession of his descendants till the middle of last century . They now belong to the Hopes of Rankeillour . The office of Lord Lion was held by two of the poet 's relatives successively — Sir David , his nephew , who became Lion King in 1591 , and his son-in-law , Sir Jerome Lyndsay , who succeeded to it in 1621 .</p>
   <p>Sir David Lyndsay , unlike most satirists , was a good , a blameless , and a religious man . The occasional loftiness of his poetic vein , the breadth of his humour , the purity of his purpose , and his strong reforming zeal combined to make his poetry exceedingly popular in Scotland for a number of ages , particularly among the lower orders . Scott introduces Andrew Fairservice , in ‘ Rob Roy , ’ saying , in reference to Francis Osbaldistone 's poetical efforts , ‘ Gude help him ! twa lines o ’ Davie Lyndsay wad ding a ’ he ever clerkit , ’ and even still there are districts of the country where his name is a household word .</p>

   <p>THOMAS TUSSER .</p>
   <p>Of Tusser we know only that he was horn in the year 1523 , was well educated , commenced life as a courtier under the patronage of Lord Paget , but became a farmer , pursuing agriculture at Ratwood in Sussex , Ipswich , Fairsted in Essex , Norwich , and other places ; that he was not successful , and had to betake himself to other occupations , such as those of a chorister , fiddler , &amp; c .; and that , finally , he died a poor man in London in the year 1580 . Tusser has left only one work , published in 1557 , entitled ‘ A Hundred Good Points of Husbandrie , ’ written in simple but sometimes strong verse . It is our first , and not our worst didactic poem .</p>

   <p>In Tottell 's ‘ Miscellany , ’ the first of the sort in the English language , published in 1557 , although the names of many of the authors are not given , the following writers are understood to have contributed :— Sir Francis Bryan , a friend of Wyatt 's , one of the principal ornaments of the Court of Henry VIII ., and who died , in 1548 , Chief Justiciary of Ireland ; George Boleyn , Earl of Rochford , the amiable brother of the famous Anne Boleyn , and who fell a victim to the insane jealousy of Henry , being beheaded in 1536 ; and Lord Thomas Vaux , son of Nicholas Vaux , who died in the latter end of Queen Mary 's reign . In the same Miscellany is found ‘ Phillide and Harpalus , ’ the ‘ first true pastoral , ’ says Warton , ‘ in the English language , ’ ( see ‘ Specimens . ’ ) To it are annexed , too , a collection of ‘ Songes , written by N. G ., ’ which means Nicholas Grimoald , an Oxford man , renowned for his rhetorical lectures in Christ Church , and for being , after Surrey , our first writer of blank verse , in the modulation of which he excelled even Surrey . Henry himself , who was an expert musician , is said also to have composed a book of sonnets and one madrigal in praise of Anne Boleyn . In the same reign occur the names of Borde , Bale , Bryan , Annesley , John Rastell , Wilfred Holme , and Charles Bansley , all writers of minor and forgotten poems . John Heywood , called the Epigrammatist , was of a somewhat higher order . He was the favourite of Sir Thomas More and the pensioner of Henry VIII . He gained favour partly through his conversational humour , and partly through his writings . He is the author of various comedies ; of six hundred epigrams , most of them very poor ; of a dialogue , in verse , containing all the proverbs then afloat in the language ; of an apologue , entitled ‘ The Spider and the Fly , ’ &amp; c. Heywood , who was a rigid Papist , left the kingdom after the decease of Queen Mary , and died at Mechlin , in Brabant , in 1565 . Warton has preserved some specimens of Sir Thomas More 's poetry , which do not add much to our conception of his genius . In 1542 , one Robert Vaughan wrote an alliterative poem , entitled ‘ The Falcon and the Pie . ’ In 1521 , ‘ The Not-browne Maid , ’ ( given by us in ‘ Percy 's Reliques , ’ ) appeared in a curious collection , called ‘ Arnolde 's Chronicle , or Customs of London . ’ In the same year Wynkyn de Worde printed a set of ‘ Christmas Carols , ’ and in 1529 ‘ A Treatise of Merlin , or his Prophecies in Verse . ’ In Henry 's days , too , there commences the long line of translators of the Psalms into English metre , commencing with Thomas Sternhold , groom of the robes to the King , who versified fifty-one psalms , which were published in 1549 , and with John Hopkins , a clergyman and schoolmaster in Suffolk , who added fifty-eight more , and progressing with Whyttingham , Thomas Norton , ( the joint author , along with Lord Buckhurst , of the curious old tragedy of ‘ Gorboduc , ’ ) Robert Wisdome , William Hunnis , William Baldwyn , Parker , the scholarly and celebrated Archbishop of Canterbury , &amp; c. &amp; c. Parker trans - lated all the Psalms himself ; and John Day published in 1562 , and attached to the Book of Common Prayer , the whole of Sternhold and Hopkins ’ ‘ Psalms , with apt notes to sing them withall . ’ In Edward 's reign appeared a very different strain — the first drinking-song of merit in the language , ‘ Back and sides go bare ’ — ( see ‘ Specimens , ’ vol . 2 . ) This song occurs at the opening of the second act of ‘ Gammer Gurton 's Needle , ’ a comedy written ( by a ‘ Mr S . ’ ) and printed in 1551 , and afterwards acted at Christ 's College in Cambridge .</p>
   <p>In the reign of Mary , flourished Richard Edwards , a man of no small versatility of genius . He was a native of Somersetshire , was born about 1523 , and died in 1566 . He wrote two comedies , one entitled ‘ Damon and Pythias , ’ and the other ‘ Palamon and Arcité , ’ both of which were acted before Queen Elizabeth . He also contrived masques and wrote verses for pageants , and is said to have been the first fiddler , the most elegant sonnetteer , and the most amusing mimic of the Court . He is the author of a pleasing poem , entitled ‘ Amantium irae , ’ and of some lines under the title , ‘ He requesteth some friendly comfort , affirming his constancy . ’ We quote a few of them :—</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ The mountains nigh , whose lofty tops do meet the haughty sky ,</l>
     <l n="2">The craggy rock , that to the sea free passage doth deny ,</l>
     <l n="3">The aged oak , that doth resist the force of blust'ring blast ,</l>
     <l n="4">The pleasant herb , that everywhere a pleasant smell doth cast ,</l>
     <l n="5">The lion 's force , whose courage stout declares a prince-like might ,</l>
     <l n="6">The eagle , that for worthiness is borne of kings in fight —</l>
     <l n="7">Then these , I say , and thousands more , by tract of time decay ,</l>
     <l n="8">And , like to time , do quite consume and fade from form to clay ;</l>
     <l n="9">But my true heart and service vow 'd shall last time out of mind ,</l>
     <l n="10">And still remain , as thine by doom , as Cupid hath assign 'd . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">Edwards also contributed some beautiful things to the well-known old</l>
     <l n="12">collection , ‘ The Paradise of Dainty Devices . ’</l>

   <p>GEORGE GASCOIGNE .</p>
   <p>Gascoigne was born in 1540 , in Essex , of an ancient family . He was educated at Cambridge , and entered at Gray 's Inn , but was disinherited by his father for extravagance , and betook himself to Holland , where he obtained a commission from the Prince of Orange . After various vicissitudes of fortune , being at one time taken prisoner by the Spaniards , and at another receiving a reward from the Prince of three hundred guilders above his pay for his brave conduct at the siege of Middleburg , he returned to England . In 1575 , he accompanied Queen Elizabeth in one of her progresses , and wrote for her a mask , entitled ‘ The Princely Pleasures of Kenilworth . ’ He is said to have died at Stamford in 1578 . He is the author of two or three translated dramas , such as ‘ The Supposes , ’ a comedy from Ariosto , and ‘ Jocasta , ’ a tragedy from Euripides , besides some graceful and lively minor pieces , one or two of which we append .</p>

    <head>THOMAS SACKVILLE , LORD BUCKHURST AND EARL OF DORSET .</head>
    <head>This was a man of remarkable powers . He was the son of Sir Richard Sackville , and born at Withyam , in Sussex , in 1527 . He was educated and became distinguished at both the universities . While a student of the Inner Temple , he wrote , some say in conjunction with Thomas Norton , the tragedy of ‘ Gorboduc , ’ which is probably the earliest original tragedy in the English language . It was first played as part of a Christmas entertainment by the young students , and subsequently before Queen Elizabeth at Whitehall in 1561 . Sackville was elected to Parliament when thirty years of age . In the same year ( 1557 ) he formed the plan of a magnificent poem , which , had he fully accomplished it , would have ranked his name with Dante , Spenser , and Bunyan . This was his ‘ Mirrour for Magistrates , ’ a poem intended to celebrate the chief of the illustrious unfortunates in British history , such as King Richard II ., Owen Glendower , James I. of Scotland , Henry VI ., Jack Cade , the Duke of Buckingham , &amp; c ., in a series of legends , supposed to be spoken by the characters them - selves , and with epilogues interspersed to connect the stories . The work aspired to be the English ‘ Decameron ’ of doom , and the part of it extant is truly called by Campbell ‘ a bold and gloomy landscape , on which the sun never shines . ’ Sackville had coadjutors in the work , all men of considerable mark , such as Skelton , Baldwyn , a learned ecclesiastic , and Ferrers , a man of rank . The first edition of the ‘ Mirrour for Magistrates ’ appeared in 1559 , and was wholly composed by Baldwyn and Ferrers . In the second , which was issued in 1563 , appeared the ‘ Induction and Legend of Henry Duke of Buckingham ’ from Sackville 's own pen . He lays the scene in hell , and descends there under the guidance of Sorrow . His pictures are more condensed than those of Spenser , although less so than those of Dante , and are often startling in their power , and deep , desolate grandeur . Take this , for instance , of ‘ Old Age : ’ —</head>
     <l n="1">‘ Crook-back 'd he was , tooth-shaken , and blear-eyed ,</l>
     <l n="2">Went on three feet , and sometime crept on four ,</l>
     <l n="3">With old lame bones , that rattled by his side ;</l>
     <l n="4">His scalp all piled , and he with eld forelore ,</l>
     <l n="5">His wither 'd fist still knocking at Deaths door ;</l>
     <l n="6">Fumbling and drivelling , as he draws his breath ;</l>
     <l n="7">For brief — the shape and messenger of Death . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Politics diverted Sackville from poetry . This is deeply to be regretted , as his poetic gift was of a very rare order . In 1566 , on the death of his father , he was promoted to the title of Lord Buckhurst . In the fourteenth year of Elizabeth 's reign he was employed by her in an embassy to Charles IX . of France . In 1587 he went as an ambassador to the United Provinces . He was subsequently made Knight of the Garter and Chancellor of Oxford . On the death of Lord Burleigh he became Lord High Treasurer of England . In March 1604 he was created Earl of Dorset by James I ., but died suddenly soon after , at the council table , of a disease of the brain . He was , as a statesman , almost immaculate in reputation . Like Burke and Canning , in later days , he carried taste and literary exactitude into his political functions , and , on account of his eloquence , was called ‘ the Bell of the Star-Chamber . ’ Even in that Augustan age of our history , and in that most brilliantly intellectual Court , it may be doubted if , with the sole exception of Lord Bacon , there was a man to be compared to Thomas Sackville for genius .</p>

   <p>SIR PHILIP SIDNEY .</p>
   <p>All hail to Sidney !— the pink of chivalry — the hero of Zutphen — the author of the ‘ Arcadia , ’ — the gifted , courteous , genial and noble-minded man ! He was born November 29 , 1554 , at Penshurst , Kent . His father 's name was Henry . He studied at Shrewsbury , at Trinity College , Cambridge , and at Christ Church , Oxford . At the age of eighteen he set out on his travels , and , in the course of three years , visited France , Flanders , Germany , Hungary , and Italy . On his return he was introduced at Court , and became a favourite with Queen Elizabeth , who sent him on an embassy to Germany . He returned home , and shortly after had a quarrel at a tournament with Lord Oxford . But for the interference of the Queen , a duel would have taken place . Sidney was displeased at the issue of the affair , and retired , in 1580 , to Wilton , in Wiltshire , where he wrote his famous ‘ Arcadia , ’ — that true prose-poem , and a work which , with all its faults , no mere sulky and spoiled child ( as some have called him in the matter of this retreat ) could ever have produced . This production , written as an outflow of his mind in its self-sought solitude , was never meant for publication , and did not appear till after its author 's death . As it was written partly for his sister 's amusement , he entitled it ‘ The Countess of Pembroke 's Arcadia . ’ In 1581 , Sidney reappeared in Court , and distinguished himself in the jousts and tournaments celebrated in honour of the Duke of Anjou ; and on the return of that prince to the Continent , he accompanied him to Antwerp . In 1583 he received the honour of knighthood . He published about this time a tract entitled ‘ The Defence of Poesy , ’ which abounds in the element the praise of which it celebrates , and which is , besides , distinguished by acuteness of argument and felicity of expression . In 1585 he was named one of the candidates for the crown of Poland ; but Queen Elizabeth , afraid of ‘ losing the jewel of her times , ’ prevented him from accepting this honour , and prevented him also from accompanying Sir Francis Drake on an expedition against the Spanish settlements in America . In the same year , however , she made him Governor of Flushing , and subsequently General of the Cavalry , under his uncle , the Earl of Leicester , who commanded the troops sent to assist the oppressed Dutch Protestants against the Spaniards . Here our hero greatly distinguished himself , particularly when capturing , in 1586 , the town of Axel . His career , however , was destined to be short . On the 22d of September of the same year he accidentally encountered a convoy of the enemy marching toward Zutphen . In the engagement which followed , his party triumphed ; but their brave commander received a shot in the thigh , which shattered the bone . As he was carried from the field , overcome with thirst , he called for water , but while about to apply it to his lips , he saw a wounded soldier carried by who was eagerly eyeing the cup . Sidney , perceiving this , instantly delivered to him the water , saying , in words which would have made an ordinary man immortal , but which give Sir Philip a twofold immortality , ‘ Thy necessity is greater than mine . ’ He was carried to Arnheim , and lingered on till October 17 , when he died . He was only thirty-two years of age . His death was an earthquake at home . All England wore mourning for him . Queen Elizabeth ordered his remains to be carried to London , and to receive a public funeral in St Paul 's . He was identified with the land 's Poetry , Politeness , and Protestantism ; and all who admired any of the three , sorrowed for Sidney .</p>
   <p>Sidney 's ‘ Sonnets and other Poems ’ contain much that is quaint , but also much that is beautiful and true ; yet they are the least poetical of his works . His ‘ Arcadia ’ is a glorious unfinished and unpolished wilderness of fancy . It is a vineyard , the scattered clusters of which are so heavy , that , like the grapes of Eshcol of old , they must be carried on a staff . Here is one of those rich clusters :—</p>
   <p>‘ There were hills , which garnished their proud heights with stately trees ; humble valleys , whose base estate seemed comforted with the refreshing of silver rivers ; meadows , enamelled with all sorts of eye-pleasing flowers ; thickets , which , being lined with most pleasant shade , were witnessed so , too , by the cheerful disposition of many well-tuned birds ; each pasture stored with sheep , feeding with sober security ; while the pretty lambs , with bleating oratory , craved the dams ’ comfort ; here a shepherd 's boy , piping as though he should never be old ; there a young shepherdess , knitting and withal singing , and it seemed that her voice comforted her hands to work , and her hands kept time to her voice-music . ’</p>
   <p>From ‘ The Defence of Poesy ’ we could cull , did space permit , a hundred passages even superior to the above , full of dexterous reasoning , splendid rhetoric , and subtle fancy , and substantiating all that has been said in favour of Sir Philip Sidney 's accomplishments , chivalric earnestness , and richly-endowed genius .</p>

   <p>ROBERT SOUTHWELL .</p>
   <p>Robert Southwell was born in 1560 , at St . Faith 's , Norfolk . His parents were Roman Catholics , and sent him when very young to be educated at the English College of Douay , in Flanders . Thence he went to Borne , and when sixteen years of age he joined the Society of the Jesuits — a strange bed for the rearing of a poet . In 1585 , he was appointed Prefect of Studies , and was soon after despatched as a missionary of his order to England . There , notwithstanding a law condemning to death all members of his profession found in this country , he laboured on for eight years , residing chiefly with Anne , Countess of Arundel , who died afterwards in the Tower . In July 1592 , Southwell was arrested in a gentleman 's house at Uxendon in Middlesex . He was thrust into a dungeon so filthy that when he was brought out to be examined his clothes were covered with vermin . This made his father — a man of good family — petition Queen Elizabeth that if his son was guilty of anything deserving death he might suffer it , but that , meanwhile , being a gentleman , he should be treated as a gentleman . In consequence of this he was somewhat better lodged , but continued for nearly three years strictly confined to prison ; and as the Queen 's agents imagined that he was in the secret of some conspiracies against the Government , he was put to the torture ten times . In despair , he entreated to be brought to trial , whereupon Cecil coolly remarked , ‘ that if he was in such haste to be hanged , he should quickly have his desire . ’ On the 20th of February 1595 , he was brought to trial at King 's Bench , and having confessed himself a Papist and a Jesuit , he was condemned to death , and executed at Tyburn next day , with all the nameless barbarities enjoined by the treason laws of these unhappy times . He is believed to have borne all his sufferings with unalterable serenity of mind and sweetness of temper . ‘ It is fitting , ’ says Burke , ‘ that those made to suffer should suffer well . ’ And suffer well throughout all his short life of sorrow , Southwell did .</p>
   <p>He was , undoubtedly , although in a false position , a true man , and a true poet . To hope all things and believe all things , in reference to a Jesuit , is a difficult task for Protestant charity . Yet what system so vile but it has sometimes been gloriously misrepresented by its votaries ? Who that ever read Edward Irving 's ‘ Preface to Ben Ezra ’ — that modern Areopagitica — combining the essence of a hundred theological treatises with the spirit and grandeur of a Pindaric or Homeric ode — has forgot the pictures of Ben Ezra , or Lacunza the Jesuit ? His work , ‘ The Coming of the Messiah in Glory and Majesty , ’ Irving translated from Spanish into his own noble English prose , and he describes the author as a man of primitive manners , ardent piety , and enormous erudition , and expresses a hope , long since we trust fulfilled , of meeting with the ‘ good old Jesuit ’ in a better world . To this probably small class of exceptions to a general rule ( it surely is no uncharity to say this , since the annals of Jesuitism have confessedly been so stained with falsehood , treachery , every insidious art , and every detestable crime ) seems to have belonged our poet . No proof was produced that he had any connexion with the treacherous and bloody designs of his party , although he had plied his priestly labours with unwearied assiduity . He was too sincere-minded a man to have ever been admitted to the darker secrets of the Jesuits .</p>
   <p>His verses are ingenious , simpler in style than was common in his time — distinguished here by homely picturesqueness , and there by solemn moralising . A shade of deep but serene and unrepining sadness , connected partly with his position and partly with his foreseen destiny , ( his larger works were written in prison ,) rests on the most of his poems .</p>

   <p>THOMAS WATSON .</p>
   <p>He was born in 1560 , and died about 1592 . All besides known certainly of him is , that he was a native of London , and studied the common law , but seems to have spent much of his time in the practice of rhyme . His sonnets — one or two of which we subjoin — have considerable merit ; but we agree with Campbell in thinking that Stevens has surely overrated them when he prefers them to Shakspeare 's .</p>

   <p>In reference to the Miscellaneous Pieces which close this period , we need only say that the best of them is ‘ The Soul 's Errand , ’ and that its authorship is uncertain . It has , with very little evidence in any of the cases , been ascribed to Sir Walter Raleigh , to Francis Davison , ( author of a compilation entitled ‘ A Poetical Rhapsody , ’ published in 1593 , and where ‘ The Soul 's Errand ’ first appeared ,) and to Joshua Sylvester , who prints it in his volume of verses , with vile interpolations of his own . Its outspoken energy and pithy language render it worthy of any of our poets .</p>

   <p>SECOND PERIOD .</p>
   <p>FROM SPENSER TO DRYDEN .</p>
   <p>FRANCIS BEAUMONT .</p>
   <p>This remarkable man , from his intimate connexion with Fletcher , is better known as a dramatist than as a poet . He was the son of Judge Beaumont , and descended from an ancient family , which was settled at Grace Dieu in Leicestershire . He was born in 1585-86 , and educated at Cambridge . Thence he passed to study in the Inner Temple , but seems to have preferred poetry and the drama to law . He was married to the daughter of Sir Henry Isley of Kent , who bore him two daughters . He died in his 30th year , and was buried March 9 , 1615-16 , in St Benedict 's Chapel , Westminster Abbey . More of his connexion with Fletcher afterwards .</p>
   <p>After his death , his brother published a collection of his miscellaneous pieces . We extract a few , of no little merit . His verses to Ben Jonson , written before their author came to London , and first appended to a play entitled ‘ Nice Valour , ’ are picturesque and interesting , as illustrating the period .</p>

   <p>SIR WALTER RALEIGH .</p>
   <p>The verses attributed to this illustrious man are few , and the authenticity of some of them is doubtful . No one , however , who has studied his career , or read his ‘ History of the World , ’ can deny him the title of a great poet .</p>
   <p>We cannot be expected , in a work of the present kind , to enlarge on a career so well known as that of Sir Walter Kaleigh . He was born in 1552 , at Hayes Farm , in Devonshire , and descended from an old family there . He went early to Oxford , but finding its pursuits too tame for his active and enterprising spirit , he left it , and became a soldier at seventeen . For six years he fought on the Protestant side in France , besides serving a campaign in the Netherlands . In 1579 , he went a voyage , which proved disastrous , to Newfoundland , in company with his half-brother , Sir Humphrey Gilbert . There can be no doubt that this early apprenticeship to war and navigation was of material service to the future explorer and historian . In 1580 , he fought in Ireland against the Earl of Desmond , who had raised a rebellion there , and on one occasion is said to have defended a ford of Shannon against a whole band of wild Irish rebels , till the stream ran purple with their blood and his own . With the Lord - Deputy , Lord Grey de Wilton , he got into a dispute , and to settle it came over to England . Here high favour awaited him . His handsome appearance , his graceful address , his ready wit and chivalric courtesy , dashed with a fine poetic enthusiasm , ( see them admirably pictured in ‘ Kenilworth , ’ ) combined to exalt him in the estimation of Queen Elizabeth . On one occasion he flung his rich plush cloak over a miry part of the way , that she might pass on unsoiled . By this delicate piece of enacted flattery he ‘ spoiled a cloak and made a fortune . ’ The Queen sent him , along with some other courtiers , to attend the Duke of Anjou , who had in vain solicited her hand , back to the Netherlands . In 1584 , he fitted two ships , and sent them out for the discovery and settlement of those parts of North America not already appropriated by Christian states , and the next year there followed a fleet of seven ships under the command of Sir Richard Grenville , Raleigh 's kinsman . The attempt to colonise America at that time failed , but two important things were transplanted through means of the expedition from Virginia to Britain , namely , tobacco and the potato , — the former of which has ever since been offered up in smoky sacrifice to Raleigh 's memory throughout the whole world , and the latter of which has become the most valuable of all our vegetable esculents . Raleigh first planted the potato in Ireland , a country of which it has long been the principal food . A ludicrous story is told about this . It is said that he had invited a number of his neighbours to an entertainment , in which the new root was to form a prominent part , but when the feast began Raleigh found , to his horror , that the servants had boiled the plums , a most unsavoury mess , and immediately , we suppose , ‘ tabulae solvuntur risu . ’ In 1584 the Queen had knighted him , and shortly after she granted him certain lucrative monopolies , and an estate in Ireland , in addition to one he had possessed for some years . In 1588 , he was of material service as one of Her Majesty 's Council of War , formed to resist the Spanish Armada , and as one of the volunteers who joined the English fleet with ships of their own . Next year he accompanied a number of his countrymen in an expedition , which had it in view to restore Don Antonio to the throne of Portugal , of which the Spaniards had deprived him . On his return he lost caste considerably , both with the Queen and country , by taking bribes , and otherwise abusing the influence he had acquired at Court . Yet , about this time , his active mind was projecting what he called an ‘ Office of Address , ’ — a plan for facilitating the designs of literary and scientific men , promoting intercourse between them , gaining , in short , all those objects which are now secured by our literary associations and philosophical societies . Raleigh was eminently a man before his age , but , alas ! his age was too far behind him .</p>
   <p>While visiting Ireland , after his expedition to Portugal , he contracted an intimacy with Spenser . ( See our ‘ Life of Spenser , ’ vol . ii . ) In 1592 , he commanded a large naval expedition , destined to attack Panama and intercept the Spanish Plate-fleet , but was recalled by the Queen , not , however , till he had seized on an important prize , and , in common parlance , had ‘ feathered his nest . ’ On his return he excited Her Majesty 's wrath , by an intrigue with Elizabeth Throgmorton , one of the maids of honour , and , although Raleigh afterwards married her , the Queen imprisoned both the offending parties for some months in the Tower . Spenser is believed to allude to this in the 4th Book of his great poem . ( See vol . in . of our edition , p . 88 . ) Even after he was released from the Tower , Raleigh had to leave the Court in disgrace ; instead , however , of wasting time in vain regrets , he undertook , at his own expense , an expedition against Guiana , where he captured the city of San Joseph , and which he occupied in the Queen 's name . After his return he published an account of his expedition , more distinguished by glowing eloquence than by rigid regard to truth . In 1596 , having in some measure regained the Queen 's favour , he was appointed to a command in the expedition against Cadiz , under the Earl of Essex . In this , as well as in the expedition against the Spanish Plate-fleet the next year , he won laurels , but was unfortunate enough to excite the jealousy of his Commander-in-Chief . When the favourite got into trouble , Raleigh eagerly joined in the hunt , wrote a letter to Cecil urging him to the destruction of Essex , and witnessed his execution from a window in the Armoury . This is undoubtedly a deep blot on the escutcheon of our hero .</p>
   <p>Cecil had been glad of Raleigh 's aid in ruining Essex , but he bore him no good-will otherwise , and is said to have poisoned James , who now succeeded to the English throne , against him . Assuredly the new King was no friend of Raleigh 's . Stimulated by Cecil , after first depriving him of his office of Captain of the Guards , he brought him to trial for high treason . He was accused of conspiring to establish Popery , to dethrone the King , and to put the crown on the head of Arabella Stewart . Sir Edward Coke , the Attorney-General , led the accusation , and disgraced himself by heaping on Raleigh 's head every foul epithet , calling him ‘ viper , ’ ‘ damnable atheist , ’ ‘ monster , ’ ‘ traitor , ’ ‘ spider of hell , ’ &amp; c ., and by his violence , although to his own surprise , as he never expected to gain his cause in full , he browbeat the jury to bring in a verdict of high treason .</p>
   <p>Raleigh 's defence was a masterpiece of temper , dignity , strength of reasoning , and eloquence , and his enemies were ashamed of the decision to which they had driven the jury . He was therefore reprieved , and committed to the Tower , where his wife was allowed to bear him company , and where his youngest son was born . His estates were , in general , preserved to him , but Carr , the infamous minion of the King , under some pretext of a flaw in the conveyance of it by Raleigh to his son , seized upon his manor of Sherborne . In the Tower he continued for twelve years . These years his industry and genius rendered the happiest probably of his life . Immured in the</p>
   <p>‘ towers of Julius , London 's lasting shame , By many a foul and midnight murder fed , ’</p>
   <p>his winged soul soared away , like the dove of the Deluge , over the wild ocean of the past . The Tower confined his body , but this great globe the world seemed too little for the sweep of his spirit . To fill up the vast void which a long imprisonment created around him , and to shew that his powers retained all their elasticity , he projected a work on the largest scale , and with the noblest purpose — ‘ The History of the World . ’ In this undertaking he found literary men ready to lend him their aid . A hundred hands were generously stretched out to gather materials , and to bring them to the captive in the Tower . Cart-loads of books were sent . One Burrell , formerly his chaplain , assisted him in much of the critical and chronological drudgery . Rugged Ben Jonson sent in a piece of rugged writing on the Punic War , which Raleigh polished and set as a carved stone in his magnificent temple . Some have , on this account , sought to detract from the merit of the author . As if ever an architect could rear a building without hodmen ! But in Raleigh 's case the hodmen were Titans . ‘ The best wits in England assisted him in his undertaking ; ’ and what a compliment was this to the strength and stature of the master-builder !</p>
   <p>This great work was never finished . The part completed comprehended only the period from the Creation to the Downfall of the Macedonian Empire — one hundred and seventy years before Christ . He tarries too long amidst the misty and mythical ages which precede the dawn of history ; his speculations on the site of the original Paradise , on the Flood , &amp; c ., are more ingenious than instructive ; but his descriptions of the Greek battles — his account of the rise of Rome — the extensive erudition , on all subjects displayed in the book — the many acute , profound , and eloquently-expressed observations which are sprinkled throughout — and the style , massive , dignified , rich , and less involved in structure than that of almost any of his contemporaries — shall always rank it amongst the great literary treasures of the language . It was published in 1614 . Besides it , Raleigh was the author of various works , all full of sagacious thought and brilliant imagery , such as ‘ The Advice to a Son on the Choice of a Wife , ’ ‘ The Sceptic , ’ ‘ Maxims of State , ’ &amp; c. At last he was released by the advance of a large sum of money to Villiers , Duke of Buckingham , James 's favourite ; and , to retrieve his fortunes , projected another expedition to America . James granted him a patent , under the Great Seal , for making a settlement in Guiana , but ungenerously did not grant him a pardon for the sentence which had been passed on him for treason . He set sail , 1617 , in a ship built by himself , called the Destiny , with eleven other vessels . Having reached the Orinoco , he despatched a portion of his forces to attack the new Spanish settlement of St Thomas . This was captured , with the loss of Raleigh 's eldest son . The expected plunder , however , proved of little value ; and Sir Walter having in vain attempted to induce his captains to attack other settlements of the Spaniards , was compelled to return home — his golden dreams dissolved , and his prophetic soul forewarning him of the doom that awaited him on his native shores . In July 1618 , he landed at Plymouth ; ‘ whence , ’ says Howell , in his ‘ Familiar Letters , ’ ‘ he thought to make an escape , and some say he tampered with his body by physic to make him look sickly , that he might be the more pitied , and permitted to lie in his own house . ’ James was at this time seeking the hand of the Infanta for his son Charles , and was naturally disposed to side with the Spanish cause . He was , besides , stirred up by the Spanish ambassador , Count Gondomar , who sent to desire an audience with His Majesty , and said , that he had only one word to say to him . ‘ The King wondered what could be delivered in one word , whereupon , when he came before him , he said only , “ Pirates ! pirates ! pirates ! ” and so departed . ’</p>
   <p>Raleigh consequently was arrested and sent back to his old lodgings in the Tower . He was not tried , as might have been expected , for the new offence of waging war against a power then at amity with England , but James , with consummate meanness and cruelty , determined to revive his former sentence . He was brought before the King 's Bench , where his old enemy , Sir Edward Coke , now sat as Chief Justice , and officially condemned him to death . His language , however , was considerably modified to the prisoner . He said , ‘ I know you have been valiant and wise , and I doubt not but you retain both these virtues , for now you shall have occasion to use them . Your faith hath heretofore been questioned , but I am resolved you are a good Christian ; for your book , which is an admirable work , doth testify as much . I would give you counsel , but I know you can apply unto yourself far better than I can give you . Yet will I ( with the good neighbour in the Gospel , who , finding one in the way wounded and distressed , poured oil into his wounds and refreshed him ) give unto you the oil of comfort , though , in respect that I am a minister of the law , mixed with vinegar . ’ Such was Coke 's comfort to the brave and gifted man who stood untrembling before his bar .</p>
   <p>On the 26th of October 1618 , the day after his condemnation , Raleigh was beheaded . He met his fate with dignity and composure . Having addressed the multitude in vindication of his conduct , he took up the axe , and said to the sheriff , ‘ This is a sharp medicine , but a sound cure for all diseases . ’ He told the executioner that he would give the signal by lifting up his hand , and ‘ then , ’ he said , ‘ fear not , but strike home . ’ He next laid himself down , but was asked by the executioner to alter the position of the head . ‘ So the heart be right , ’ he replied , ‘ it is no matter which way the head lies . ’ The headsman became uncertain and tremulous when the signal was given , whereupon Ealeigh exclaimed , ‘ Why dost thou not strike ? Strike , man ! ’ and by two blows that gallant , witty , and richly-stored head was severed from the body . He was in his sixty-fifth year . He had the night before composed the following verse :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Even such is Time , that takes on trust</l>
     <l n="2">Our youth , our joys , our all we have ,</l>
     <l n="3">And pays us but with age and dust ;</l>
     <l n="4">Who in the dark and silent grave ,</l>
     <l n="5">When we have wander 'd all our ways ,</l>
     <l n="6">Shuts up the story of our days . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Thus perished Sir Walter Raleigh . There has been ever one opinion as to the breadth and brilliance of his genius . His powers were almost universal in their range . He commented on Scripture with the ingenuity of a Talmudist , and wrote love verses ( see the lines in Campbell 's ‘ Specimens , ’ entitled ‘ Dulcina ’ ) with the animus and graceful levity of a Thomas Moore . He was deep at once in ‘ all the learning of the Egyptians , ’ and in that of the Greeks and Romans . In his large mind lay dreams of golden lands , which even Australia has not yet fully verified , alongside of maxims of the most practical wisdom . He was learned in all that had been ; well-informed as to all that was ; and speculative and hopeful as to all that might be and was yet to be . Disgust at the scholastic methods , blended with the adventurous character of his mind , and perhaps also with some looseness of moral principle , led him at one time to the brink of universal scepticism ; but disappointment , sorrow , and the solitude of the Tower , made him a sadder and wiser man , and he returned to the verities of the Christian religion . The stains on his character seem to have arisen chiefly from his position . He was , like some greater and some smaller men of eminence , undoubtedly , to a certain extent , a brilliant adventurer — a class to whom justice is seldom done , and against whom every calumny is believed . He was a novus homo , in an age of more than common aristocratic pretence ; sprang , indeed , from an ancient family , but possessing nothing himself , save his cloak , his sword , his tact , and his genius . We all know how , in later times , such spirits , kindred in many points to Raleigh , in some superior , and in others inferior — as Burke , Sheridan , and Canning — were used , less for their errors of temper or of life , than because they had gained immense influence , not by birth or favour , but by the force of extraordinary talent and no less remarkable address . Raleigh , however , was undoubtedly imprudent in a high degree . He had once or twice outraged common morality ; his enemies were constantly accusing him of gasconading and of ‘ pride . ’ His success at first was too early and too easy , and hence a reverse might have been anticipated as certain and as remarkable as his rise had been . His fall ultimately is understood to have been precipitated by the base complicity of James with the Spaniards , who were informed by the King of Raleigh 's motions in America , and prepared to counteract them , as well as by the loud-sounding invectives and legal lies of the unscrupulous instruments of his tyrannical power . With all his faults and follies , ( of ‘ crimes , ’ it has been justly said , Raleigh can hardly be accused ,) he stood high in that crowd of giants who illustrated the reign of the Amazonian Queen . What an age it was ! Bacon , with still brighter powers , and far darker and meaner faults than Raleigh , was sitting on the woolsack in body , while his spirit was presiding over the half-born philosophies of the future , and beholding the cold rod of Induction blossom in an after-day into the Aaronic flowers and fruits of a magnificent science ; Cecil was nodding out wisdom or transcendental craft in the Cabinet ; Sir Philip Sidney was carrying the spirit of ‘ Arcadia ’ into the field of battle ; Spenser was dreaming his one beautiful lifelong Dream ; and Shakspeare was holding up his calm mirror to the heart of man and the universe of nature ; while , on the prow of the British vessel , carrying on those lofty spirits and enterprises , there appeared a daring mariner , the Poet and ‘ Shepherd of the Ocean , ’ with bright eye , sanguine countenance , step treading the deck like a throne , and look contemplating the sunset , as if it were the dawning , and the Evening , as if it were the Morning Star . It was the hopeful and the brilliant Raleigh , who , while he ‘ opened up to Europe the New World , was the historian of the Old . ’ Alas that this illustrious ‘ Marinere ’ was doomed to a life so troubled and a death so dreadful , and that the glory of one of England 's prodigies is for ever bound up with the disgrace of one of England 's and Scotland 's princes !</p>

    <head>A VISION UPON ‘ THE FAIRY QUEEN . ’</head>
     <l n="1">Methought I saw the grave where Laura lay ,</l>
     <l n="2">Within that temple where the vestal flame</l>
     <l n="3">Was wont to burn : and passing by that way</l>
     <l n="4">To see that buried dust of living fame ,</l>
     <l n="5">Whose tomb fair Love and fairer Virtue kept ,</l>
     <l n="6">All suddenly I saw the Fairy Queen ,</l>
     <l n="7">At whose approach the soul of Petrarch wept ;</l>
     <l n="8">And from thenceforth those Graces were not seen ,</l>
     <l n="9">For they this Queen attended ; in whose stead</l>
     <l n="10">Oblivion laid him down on Laura 's hearse .</l>
     <l n="11">Hereat the hardest stones were seen to bleed ,</l>
     <l n="12">And groans of buried ghosts the heavens did pierce ,</l>
     <l n="13">Where Homer 's sprite did tremble all for grief ,</l>
     <l n="14">And cursed the access of that celestial thief .</l>

   <p>JOSHUA SYLVESTER .</p>
   <p>Joshua Sylvester is the next in the list of our imperfectly-known , but real poets . Very little is known of his history . He was a merchant - adventurer , and died at Middleburg , aged fifty-five , in 1618 . He is said to have applied , in 1597 , for the office of secretary to a trading company in Stade , and to have been , on this occasion , patronised by the Earl of Essex . He was at one time attached to the English Court as a pensioner of Prince Henry . He is said to have been driven abroad by the severity of his satires . He seems to have had a sweet flow of conversational eloquence , and hence was called ‘ The Silver-tongued . ’ He was an eminent linguist , and wrote his dedications in various languages . He published a large volume of poems , very unequal in their value , and inserted in it ‘ The Soul 's Errand , ’ with interpolations , as we have seen , which prove it not to be his own . His great work is the translation of the ‘ Divine Weeks and Works ’ of the French poet , Du Bartas , which is a marvellous medley of flatness and force — of childish weakness and soaring genius — with more seed poetry in it than any poem we remember , except ‘ Festus , ’ the chaos of a hundred poetic worlds . There can be little doubt that Milton was familiar with this work in boyhood , and many remarkable coincidences have been pointed out between it and ‘ Paradise Lost . ’ Sylvester was a Puritan , and his publisher , Humphrey Lownes , who lived in the same street with Milton 's father , belonged to the same sect ; and , as Campbell remarks , ‘ it is easily to be conceived that Milton often repaired to the shop of Lownes , and there met with the pious didactic poem . ’ The work , therefore , some specimens of which we subjoin , is interesting , both in itself , and as having been the prima stamina of the great masterpiece of English poetry .</p>

    <head>ADDRESS TO THE NIGHTINGALE .</head>
     <l n="1">As it fell upon a day ,</l>
     <l n="2">In the merry month of May ,</l>
     <l n="3">Sitting in a pleasant shade</l>
     <l n="4">Which a grove of myrtles made ;</l>
     <l n="5">Beasts did leap , and birds did sing ,</l>
     <l n="6">Trees did grow , and plants did spring ;</l>
     <l n="7">Everything did banish moan ,</l>
     <l n="8">Save the nightingale alone .</l>
     <l n="9">She , poor bird , as all forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="10">Lean 'd her breast up-till a thorn ;</l>
     <l n="11">And there sung the dolefull'st ditty ,</l>
     <l n="12">That to hear it was great pity .</l>
     <l n="13">‘ Fie , fie , fie , ’ now would she cry ;</l>
     <l n="14">‘ Teru , teru , ’ by and by ;</l>
     <l n="15">That , to hear her so complain ,</l>
     <l n="16">Scarce I could from tears refrain ;</l>
     <l n="17">For her griefs , so lively shown ,</l>
     <l n="18">Made me think upon mine own .</l>
     <l n="19">Ah ! ( thought I ) thou mourn'st in vain ;</l>

     <l n="21">Senseless trees , they cannot hear thee ,</l>

     <l n="24">All thy friends are lapp 'd in lead ;</l>
     <l n="25">All thy fellow-birds do sing ,</l>
     <l n="26">Careless of thy sorrowing !</l>

     <l n="28">Thou and I were both beguiled .</l>
     <l n="29">Every one that flatters thee</l>

     <l n="47">He that is thy friend indeed ,</l>

   <p>ALEXANDER HUME .</p>
   <p>This Scottish poet was the second son of Patrick , fifth Baron of Polwarth . He was born about the middle of the sixteenth century , and died in 1609 . He resided for some years , in the early part of his life , in France . Returning home , he studied law , and then tried his fortune at Court . Here he was eclipsed by a rival , named Montgomery ; and after assailing his rival , who rejoined , in verse , he became a clergyman in disgust , and was settled in the parish of Logie . Here he darkened into a sour and savage Calvinist , and uttered an exhortation to the youth of Scotland to forego the admiration of classical heroes , and to read no love-poetry save the ‘ Song of Solomon . ’ In another poetic walk , however , that of natural description , Hume excelled , and we print with pleasure some parts of his ‘ Summer 's Day , ’ which our readers may compare with Mr Aird 's fine poem under the same title , and be convinced that the sky of Scotland was as blue , and the grass as green , and Scottish eyes as quick to perceive their beauty , in the sixteenth century as now .</p>

    <head>OTHER SCOTTISH POETS .</head>
    <head>About the same time with Hume flourished two or three poets in Scotland of considerable merit , such as Alexander Scott , author of satires and amatory poems , and called sometimes the ‘ Scottish Anacreon ; ’ Sir Richard Maitland of Lethington , father of the famous Secretary Lethington , who , in his advanced years , composed and dictated to his daughter a few moral and conversational pieces , and who collected , besides , into a MS. which bears his name , the productions of some of his contemporaries ; and Alexander Montgomery , author of an allegorical poem , entitled ‘ The Cherry and the Slae . ’</head>

   <p>SAMUEL DANIEL .</p>
   <p>This ingenious person was born in 1562 , near Taunton , in Somersetshire . His father was a music-master . He was patronised by the noble family of Pembroke , who probably also maintained him at college . He went to Magdalene Hall , Oxford , in 1579 ; and after studying there , chiefly history and poetry , for seven years , he left without a degree . When twenty-three years of age , he translated Paulus Jovius ’ ‘ Discourse of Rare Inventions . ’ He became tutor to Lady Anne Clifford , the elegant and accomplished daughter of the Earl of Cumberland . She , at his death , raised a monument to his memory , and recorded on it , with pride , that she had been his pupil . After Spenser died , Daniel became a ‘ voluntary laureat ’ to the Court , producing masques and pageants , but was soon supplanted by ‘ rare Ben Jonson . ’ In 1603 he was appointed Master of the Queen 's Revels and Inspector of the Plays to be enacted by juvenile performers . He was also promoted to be Gentleman Extraordinary and Groom of the Chambers to the Queen . He was a varied and voluminous writer , composing plays , miscellaneous poems , and prose compositions , including a ‘ Defence of Rhyme ’ and a ‘ History of England , ’ — an honest , but somewhat dry and dull production . While composing his works he resided in Old Street , St Luke 's , which was then thought a suburban residence ; but he was often in town , and mingled on intimate terms with Selden and Shakspeare . When approaching sixty , he took a farm at Beckington , in Somersetshire — his native shire — and died there in 1619 .</p>
   <p>Daniel 's Plays and History are now , as wholes , forgotten , although the former contained some vigorous passages , such as Richard II . ' s soliloquy on the morning of his murder in Pomfret Castle . His smaller pieces and his Sonnets shew no ordinary poetic powers .</p>

   <p>SIR JOHN DAVIES .</p>
   <p>This knight , says Campbell , ‘ wrote , at twenty-five years of age , a poem on the “ Immortality of the Soul , ” and at fifty-two , when he was a judge and a statesman , another on the “ Art of Dancing . ” Well might the teacher of that noble accomplishment , in Molière 's comedy , exclaim , “ La philosophie est quelque chose — mais la danse ! ” This , however , is more pointed than correct , since the first of these poems was written in 1592 , when the author was only twenty-two years of age , and the latter appeared in 1599 , when he was only twenty-nine .</p>
   <p>Tisbury , in Wiltshire , was the birthplace of this poet , and 1570 the date of his birth . His father was a practising lawyer . John was expelled from the Temple for beating one Richard Martyn , afterwards Recorder , but was restored , and subsequently elected for Parliament . In 1592 , as aforesaid , appeared his poem , ‘ Nosce Teipsum ; or , The Immortality of the Soul . ’ Its fame soon travelled to Scotland ; and when Davies , along with Lord Hunsdon , visited that country , James received him most graciously as the author of ‘ Nosce Teipsum . ’ His history became , for some time , a list of promotions . He was appointed , in 1603 , first Solicitor and then Attorney-General in Ireland , was next made Sergeant , was then knighted , then appointed King 's Sergeant , next elected representative of the county of Fermanagh , and , in fine , after a violent contest between the Roman Catholic and Protestant parties , was chosen Speaker of the House of Commons in the Protestant interest . While in Ireland he married Eleanor , a daughter of Lord Audley , who turned out a raving prophetess , and was sent , in 1649 , to the Tower , and then to Bethlehem Hospital , by the Revolutionary Government . In 1616 , Sir John returned to England , continued to practise as a barrister , sat in Parliament for Newcastle - under-Lyne , and received a promise of being made Chief-Justice of England ; but was suddenly cut off by apoplexy in 1626 .</p>
   <p>His poem on dancing , which was written in fifteen days , and left a fragment , is a piece of beautiful , though somewhat extravagant fancy . His ‘ Nosce Teipsum , ’ if it casts little new light , and rears no demonstrative argument on the grand and difficult problem of immortality , is full of ingenuity , and has many apt and memorable similes . Feeling he happily likens to the</p>
   <p>‘ subtle spider , which doth sit In middle of her web , which spreadeth wide ; If aught do touch the utmost thread of it , She feels it instantly on every side . ’</p>
   <p>In answering an objection , ‘ Why , if souls continue to exist , do they not return and bring us news of that strange world ? ’ he replies —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ But as Noah 's pigeon , which return 'd no more ,</l>
     <l n="2">Did show she footing found , for all the flood ,</l>
     <l n="3">So when good souls , departed through death 's door ,</l>
     <l n="4">Come not again , it shows their dwelling good . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The poem is interesting from the musical use he makes of the quatrain , a form of verse in which Dryden afterwards wrote his ‘ Annus Mirabilis , ’ and as one of the earliest philosophical poems in the language . It is proverbially difficult to reason in verse , but Davies reasons , if not always with conclusive result , always with energy and skill .</p>

   <p>GILES FLETCHER .</p>
   <p>Giles Fletcher was the younger brother of Phineas , and died twenty-three years before him . He was a cousin of Fletcher the dramatist , and the son of Dr Giles Fletcher , who was employed in many important missions in the reign of Queen Elizabeth , and , among others , negotiated a commercial treaty with Russia greatly in the favour of his own country . Giles is supposed to have been born in 1588 . He studied at Cambridge ; published his noble poem , ‘ Christ 's Victory and Triumph , ’ in 1610 , when he was twenty - three years of age ; was appointed to the living of Alderston , in Suffolk , where he died , in 1623 , at the early age of thirty-five , ‘ equally loved , ’ says old Wood , ‘ of the Muses and the Graces . ’</p>
   <p>The poem , in four cantos , entitled ‘ Christ 's Victory and Triumph , ’ is one of almost Miltonic magnificence . With a wing as easy as it is strong , he soars to heaven , and fills the austere mouth of Justice and the golden lips of Mercy with language worthy of both . He then stoops down on the Wilderness of the Temptation , and paints the Saviour and Satan in colours admirably contrasted , and which in their brightness and blackness can never decay . Nor does he fear , in fine , to pierce the gloom of Calvary , and to mingle his note with the harps of angels , saluting the Redeemer , as He sprang from the grave , with the song , ‘ He is risen , He is risen — and shall die no more . ’ The style is steeped in Spenser — equally mellifluous , figurative , and majestic . In allegory the author of the ‘ Fairy Queen ’ is hardly superior , and in the enthusiasm of devotion Fletcher surpasses him far . From the great light , thus early kindled and early quenched , Milton did not disdain to draw with his ‘ golden urn . ’ ‘ Paradise Regained ’ owes much more than the suggestion of its subject to ‘ Christ 's Victory ; ’ and is it too much to say that , had Fletcher lived , he might have shone in the same constellation with the bard of the ‘ Paradise Lost ? ’ The plan of our ‘ Specimens ’ permits only a few extracts . Let those who wish more , along with a lengthened and glowing tribute to the author 's genius , consult Blackwood for November 1835 . The reading of a single sentence will convince them that the author of the paper was Christopher North .</p>

     <l n="1">Love is the blossom where there blows</l>
     <l n="2">Everything that lives or grows :</l>
     <l n="3">Love doth make the heavens to move ,</l>
     <l n="4">And the sun doth burn in love :</l>
     <l n="5">Love the strong and weak doth yoke ,</l>
     <l n="6">And makes the ivy climb the oak ;</l>
     <l n="7">Under whose shadows lions wild ,</l>
     <l n="8">Softened by love , grow tame and mild :</l>
     <l n="9">Love no medicine can appease ,</l>
     <l n="10">He burns the fishes in the seas ;</l>
     <l n="11">Not all the skill his wounds can stench ,</l>
     <l n="12">Not all the sea his fire can quench :</l>
     <l n="13">Love did make the bloody spear</l>
     <l n="14">Once a leafy coat to wear ,</l>
     <l n="15">While in his leaves there shrouded lay</l>
     <l n="16">Sweet birds , for love , that sing and play :</l>
     <l n="17">And of all love 's joyful flame ,</l>
     <l n="18">I the bud , and blossom am .</l>

   <p>JOHN DONNE .</p>
   <p>John Donne was born in London , in the year 1573 . He sprung from a Catholic family , and his mother was related to Sir Thomas More and to Heywood the epigrammatist . He was very early distinguished as a prodigy of boyish acquirement , and was entered , when only eleven , of Harthall , now Hertford College . He was designed for the law , but relinquished the study when he reached nineteen . About the same time , having studied the controversies between the Papists and Protestants , he deliberately went over to the latter . He next accompanied the Earl of Essex to Cadiz , and looked wistfully over the gulf dividing him from Jerusalem , with all its holy memories , to which his heart had been translated from very boyhood . He even meditated a journey to the Holy Land , but was discouraged by reports as to the dangers of the way . On his return he was received by the Lord Chancellor Ellesmere into his own house as his secretary . Here he fell in love with Miss More , the daughter of Sir George More , Lord - Lieutenant of the Tower , and the niece of the Chancellor . His passion was returned , and the pair were imprudent enough to marry privately . When the matter became known , the father-in-law became infuriated . He prevailed on Lord Ellesmere to drive Donne out of his service , and had him even for a short time imprisoned . Even when released he continued in a pitiable plight , and but for the kindness of Sir Francis Wooley , a son of Lady Ellesmere by a former marriage , who received the young couple into his family and entertained them for years , they would have perished .</p>
   <p>When Donne reached the age of thirty-four , Dr Merton , afterwards Bishop of Durham , urged him to take orders , and offered him a benefice , which he was generously to relinquish in his favour . Donne declined , on account , he said , of some past errors of life , which , ‘ though repented of and pardoned by God , might not be forgotten by men , and might cast dishonour on the sacred office . ’</p>
   <p>When Sir F. Wooley died , Sir Robert Drury became his next protector . Donne attended him on an embassy to France , and his wife formed the romantic purpose of accompanying her husband in the disguise of a page . Here was a wife fit for a poet ! In order to restrain her from her purpose , he had to address to her some verses , commencing ,</p>
   <p>‘ By our strange and fatal interview . ’</p>
   <p>Isaak Walton relates how the poet , one evening , as he sat alone in Paris , saw his wife appearing to him in vision , with a dead infant in her arms — a proof at once of the strength of his love and of his imagination . This beloved and admirable woman died in 1617 , a few days after giving birth to her twelfth child , and Donne 's grief approached distraction .</p>
   <p>When he had reached the forty-second year of his age , our poet , at the instance of King James , became a clergyman , and was successively appointed Chaplain to the King , Lecturer to Lincoln 's Inn , Dean of St Dunstan 's in the West , and Dean of St Paul 's . In the pulpit he attracted great attention , particularly from the more thoughtful and intelligent of his auditors . He continued Dean of St Paul 's till his death , which took place in 1631 , when he was approaching sixty . He died of consumption , a disease which seldom cuts down a man so near his grand climacteric .</p>
   <p>‘ He was buried , ’ says Campbell , ‘ in St Paul 's , where his figure yet remains in the vault of St Faith 's , carved from a painting , for which he sat a few days ’ ( it should be weeks ) ‘ before his death , dressed in his winding-sheet . ’ He kept this portrait constantly by his bedside to remind him of his mortality .</p>
   <p>Donne 's Sermons fill a large folio , with which we were familiar in boyhood , but have not seen since . De Quincey says , alluding partly to them , and partly to his poetry ,— ‘ Few writers have shewn a more extraordinary compass of powers than Donne , for he combined — what no other man has ever done — the last sublimation of dialectical subtlety and address with the most impassioned majesty . Massy diamonds compose the very substance of his poem on the ‘ Metempsychosis , ’ — thoughts and descriptions which have the fervent and gloomy sublimity of Ezekiel or Aeschylus ; while a diamond-dust of rhetorical brilliances is strewed over the whole of his occasional verses and his prose . ’ We beg leave to differ , in some degree , from De Quincey in his estimate of the ‘ Metempsychosis , ’ or ‘ The Progress of the Soul , ’ although we have given it entire . It has too many far-fetched conceits and obscure allegories , although redeemed , we admit , by some very precious thoughts , such as</p>
   <p>‘ This soul , to whom Luther and Mahomet were Prisons of flesh . ’</p>
   <p>Or the following quaint picture of the apple in Eden —</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ Prince of the orchard , fair as dawning morn ,</l>
     <l n="2">Fenced with the law , and ripe as soon as born . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">Or this —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">‘ Nature hath no jail , though she hath law . ’</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>If our readers , however , can admire the account the poet gives of Abel and his bitch , or see any resemblance to the severe and simple grandeur of Aeschylus and Ezekiel in the description of the soul informing a body , made of a ‘ female fish 's sandy roe ’ ‘ newly leavened with the male 's jelly , ’ we shall say no more .</p>
   <p>Donne , altogether , gives us the impression of a great genius ruined by a false system . He is a charioteer run away with by his own pampered steeds . He begins generally well , but long ere the close , quibbles , conceits , and the temptation of shewing off recondite learning , prove too strong for him , and he who commenced following a serene star , ends pursuing a will-o ’ - wisp into a bottomless morass . Compare , for instance , the ingenious nonsense which abounds in the middle and the close of his ‘ Progress of the Soul ’ with the dark , but magnificent stanzas which are the first in the poem .</p>
   <p>In no writings in the language is there more spilt treasure — a more lavish loss of beautiful , original , and striking things than in the poems of Donne . Every second line , indeed , is either bad , or unintelligible , or twisted into unnatural distortion , but even the worst passages discover a great , though trammelled and tasteless mind ; and we question if Dr Johnson himself , who has , in his ‘ Life of Cowley , ’ criticised the school of poets to which Donne belonged so severely , and in some points so justly , possessed a tithe of the rich fancy , the sublime intuition , and the lofty spirituality of Donne . How characteristic of the difference between these two great men , that , while the one shrank from the slightest footprint of death , Donne deliberately placed the image of his dead self before his eyes , and became familiar with the shadow ere the grim reality arrived !</p>
   <p>Donne 's Satires shew , in addition to the high ideal qualities , the rugged versification , the fantastic paradox , and the perverted taste of their author , great strength and clearness of judgment , and a deep , although somewhat jaundiced , view of human nature . That there must have been something morbid in the structure of his mind is proved by the fact that he wrote an elaborate treatise , which was not published till after his death , entitled , ‘ Biathanatos , ’ to prove that suicide was not necessarily sinful .</p>

   <p>MICHAEL DRAYTON ,</p>
   <p>The author of ‘ Polyolbion , ’ was born in the parish of Atherston , in Warwickshire , about the year 1563 . He was the son of a butcher , but displayed such precocity that several persons of quality , such as Sir Walter Aston and the Countess of Bedford , patronised him . In his childhood he was eager to know what strange kind of beings poets were ; and on coming to Oxford , ( if , indeed , he did study there ,) is said to have importuned his tutor to make him , if possible , a poet . He was supported chiefly , through his life , by the Lady Bedford . He paid court , without success , to King James . In 1593 ( having long ere this become that ‘ strange thing a poet ’ ) he published a collection of his Pastorals , and afterwards his ‘ Barons ’ Wars ’ and ‘ England 's Heroical Epistles , ’ which are both rhymed histories . In 1612-13 he published the first part of ‘ Polyolbion , ’ and in 1622 completed the work . In 1626 we hear of him being styled Poet Laureate , but the title then implied neither royal appointment , nor fee , nor , we presume , duty . In 1627 he published ‘ The Battle of Agincourt , ’ ‘ The Court of Faerie , ’ and other poems ; and , three years later , a book called ‘ The Muses ’ Elysium . ’ He had at last found an asylum in the family of the Earl of Dorset ; whose noble lady , Lady Anne Clifford , subsequently Countess of Pembroke , and who had been , we saw , Daniel 's pupil , after Drayton 's death in 1631 , erected him a monument , with a gold-lettered inscription , in Westminster Abbey .</p>
   <p>The main pillar of Drayton 's fame is ‘ Polyolbion , ’ which forms a poetical description of England , in thirty songs or books , to which the learned Camden appended notes . The learning and knowledge of this poem are exten - sive , and many of the descriptions are true and spirited , but the space of ground traversed is too large , and the form of versification is too heavy , for so long a flight . Campbell justly remarks ,— ‘ On a general survey , the mass of his poetry has no strength or sustaining spirit equal to its bulk . There is a perpetual play of fancy on its surface ; but the impulses of passion , and the guidance of judgment , give it no strong movements or consistent course . ’</p>
   <p>Drayton eminently suits a ‘ Selection ’ such as ours , since his parts are better than his whole .</p>

    <head>EDWARD FAIRFAX .</head>
    <head>Edward Fairfax was the second , some say the natural , son of Sir Thomas Fairfax of Denton , in Yorkshire . The dates of his birth and of his death are unknown , although he was living in 1631 . While his brothers were pursuing military glory in the field , Edward married early , and settled in Fuystone , a place near Knaresborough Forest . Here he spent part of his time in managing his elder brother , Lord Fairfax 's property , and partly in literary pursuits . He wrote a strange treatise on Demonology , a History of Edward the Black Prince , which has never been printed , some poor Eclogues , and a most beautiful translation of Tasso , which stamps him a true poet as well as a benefactor to the English language , and on account of which Collins calls him —</head>

   <p>SIR HENRY WOTTON</p>
   <p>Was born in Kent , in 1568 ; educated at Winchester and Oxford ; and , after travelling on the Continent , became the Secretary of Essex , but had the sagacity to foresee his downfall , and withdrew from the kingdom in time . On his return he became a favourite of James I ., who employed him to be ambassador to Venice ,— a post he held long , and occupied with great skill and adroitness . Toward the end of his days , in order to gain the Provost - ship of Eton , he took orders , and died in that situation , in 1639 , in the 72d year of his age . His writings were published in 1651 , under the title of ‘ Reliquitae Wottonianae , ’ and Izaak Walton has written an entertaining account of his life . His poetry has a few pleasing and smooth-flowing passages ; but perhaps the best thing recorded of him is his viva voce account of an English ambassador , as ‘ an honest gentleman sent to LIE abroad for the good of his country . ’</p>

   <p>RICHARD CORBET .</p>
   <p>This witty and good-natured bishop was born in 1582 . He was the son of a gardener , who , however , had the honour to be known to and sung by Ben Jonson . He was educated at Westminster and Oxford ; and having received orders , was made successively Bishop of Oxford and of Norwich . He was a most facetious and rather too convivial person ; and a collection of anecdotes about him might be made , little inferior , in point of wit and coarseness , to that famous one , once so popular in Scotland , relating to the sayings and doings of George Buchanan . He is said , on one occasion , to have aided an unfortunate ballad-singer in his professional duty by arraying himself in his leathern jacket and vending the stock , being possessed of a fine presence and a clear , full , ringing voice . Occasionally doffing his clerical costume he adjourned with his chaplain , Dr Lushington , to the wine-cellar , where care and ceremony were both speedily drowned , the one of the pair exclaiming , ‘ Here 's to thee , Lushington , ’ and the other , ‘ Here 's to thee , Corbet . ’ Men winked at these irregularities , probably on the principle mentioned by Scott , in reference to Prior Aymer , in ‘ Ivanhoe , ’ — ‘ If Prior Aymer rode hard in the chase , or remained late at the banquet , men only shrugged up their shoulders by recollecting that the same irregularities were practised by many of his brethren , who had no redeeming qualities whatsoever to atone for them . ’ Corbet , on the other hand , was a kind as well as a convivial — a warm-hearted as well as an eccentric man . He was tolerant to the Puritans and sectaries ; his attention to his duties was respectable ; his talents were of a high order , and he had in him a vein of genius of no ordinary kind . He died in 1635 , but his poems were not published till 1647 . They are of various merit , and treat of various subjects . In his ‘ Journey to France , ’ you see the humorist , who , on one occasion , when the country people were flocking to be confirmed , cried , ‘ Bear off there , or I 'll confirm ye with my staff . ’ In his lines to his son Vincent , we see , notwithstanding all his foibles , the good man ; and in his ‘ Farewell to the Fairies ’ the fine and fanciful poet .</p>

    <head>BEN JONSON .</head>
    <head>As ‘ rare Ben ’ chiefly shone as a dramatist , we need not recount at length the events of his life . He was born in 1574 ; his father , who had been a clergyman in Westminster , and was sprung from a Scotch family in Annandale , having died before his birth . His mother marrying a bricklayer , Ben was brought up to the same employment . Disliking this , he enlisted in the army , and served with credit in the Low Countries . When he came home , he entered St John 's College , Cambridge ; but his stay there must have been short , since he is found in London at the age of twenty , married , and acting on the stage . He began at the same time to write dramas . He was unlucky enough to quarrel with and kill another performer , for which he was committed to prison , but released without a trial . He resumed his labours as a writer for the stage ; but having failed in the acting department , he forsook it for ever . His first hit was , ‘ Every Man in his Humour , ’ a play enacted in 1598 , Shakspeare being one of the actors . His course afterwards was chequered . He quarrelled with Marston and Dekker ,— he was imprisoned for some reflections on the Scottish nation in one of his comedies ,— he was appointed in 1619 poet - laureate , with a pension of 100 marks ,— he made the same year a journey to Scotland on foot , where he visited Drummond at Hawthornden , and they seem to have mutually loathed each other , ’ — he fell into habits of intemperance , and acquired , as he said himself ,</head>
     <l n="1">‘ A mountain belly and a rocky face . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>His favourite haunts were the Mermaid , and the Falcon Tavern , Southwark . He was engaged in constant squabbles with his contemporaries , and died at last , in 1637 , in miserably poor circumstances . He was buried in Westminster Abbey , under a square tablet , where one of his admirers afterwards inscribed the words ,</p>
   <p>‘ O rare Ben Jonson ! ’</p>
   <p>Of his powers as a dramatist we need not speak , but present our readers with some rough and racy specimens of his poetry .</p>

     <l n="33">Fat , aged carps that run into thy net ,</l>
     <l n="34">And pikes , now weary their own kind to eat ,</l>
     <l n="35">As both the second draught or cast to stay ,</l>

     <l n="145">And all the Muses still were in their prime ,</l>
     <l n="146">When , like Apollo , he came forth to warm</l>
     <l n="147">Our ears , or like a Mercury , to charm !</l>
     <l n="148">Nature herself was proud of his designs ,</l>
     <l n="149">And joy 'd to wear the dressing of his lines ,</l>
     <l n="150">Which were so richly spun , and woven so fit ,</l>
     <l n="151">As , since , she will vouchsafe no other wit .</l>

     <l n="157">My gentle Shakspeare , must enjoy a part ,</l>
     <l n="158">For though the poet 's matter nature be ,</l>
     <l n="159">His art doth give the fashion ; and , that he</l>
     <l n="160">Who casts to write a living line , must sweat</l>
     <l n="161">( Such as thine are ) and strike the second heat</l>
     <l n="162">Upon the Muses ’ anvil ; turn the same ,</l>
     <l n="163">And himself with it , that he thinks to frame ;</l>
     <l n="164">Or for the laurel , he may gain a scorn ;</l>
     <l n="165">For a good poet 's made as well as born ,</l>
     <l n="166">And such wert thou ! Look how the father 's face</l>
     <l n="167">Lives in his issue , even so the race</l>

     <l n="169">In his well-turned and true-filed lines ;</l>
     <l n="170">In each of which he seems to shake a lance ,</l>
     <l n="171">As brandish 'd at the eyes of ignorance .</l>
     <l n="172">Sweet Swan of Avon ! what a sight it were</l>
     <l n="173">To see thee in our water yet appear ,</l>
     <l n="174">And make those flights upon the banks of Thames</l>
     <l n="175">That so did take Eliza and our James !</l>
     <l n="176">But stay , I see thee in the hemisphere</l>
     <l n="177">Advanced , and made a constellation there !</l>
     <l n="178">Shine forth , thou Star of Poets , and with rage ,</l>
     <l n="179">Or influence , chide , or cheer the drooping stage ,</l>
     <l n="180">Which since thy flight from hence hath mourn 'd like night ,</l>

   </lg>
   <p>In the same age of fertile , seething mind which produced Jonson and the rest of the Elizabethan giants , there flourished some minor poets , whose names we merely chronicle : such as Edward Vere , Earl of Oxford , born 1534 , and dying 1604 , who travelled in Italy in his youth , and returned the ‘ most accomplished coxcomb in Europe , ’ who sat as Grand Chamberlain of England upon the trial of Mary Queen of Scots , and who has left , in the ‘ Paradise of Dainty Devices , ’ some rather beautiful verses , entitled , ‘ Fancy and Desire ; ’ — as Thomas Storrer , a student of Christ Church , Oxford , and the author of a versified ‘ History of Cardinal Wolsey , ’ in three parts , who died in 1604 ;— as William Warner , a native of Oxfordshire , born in 1558 , who became an attorney of the Common Pleas in London , and died suddenly in 1609 , having made himself famous for a time by a poem , entitled ‘ Albion 's England , ’ called by Campbell ‘ an enormous ballad on the history , or rather the fables appendant to the history of England , ’ with some fine touches , but heavy and prolix as a whole ;— as Sir John Harrington , who was the son of a poet and the favourite of Essex , who was created a Knight of the Bath by James I ., and who wrote some pointed epigrams and a miserable translation of Ariosto , in which heeffectually tamed that wild Pegasus ; — as Henry Perrot , who collected , in 1613 , a book of epigrams , entitled , ‘ Springes for Woodcocks ; ’ — as Sir Thomas Overbury , whose dreadful and mysterious fate , well known to all who read English history , excited such a sympathy for him , that his poems , ‘ A Wife , ’ and ‘ The Choice of a Wife , ’ passed through sixteen editions before the year 1653 , although his prose ‘ Characters , ’ such as the exquisite and well-known ‘ Fair and Happy Milkmaid , ’ are far better than his poetry ;— as Samuel Rowlandes , a prolific pamphleteer in the reigns of Elizabeth , James I ., and Charles I ., author also of several plays and of a book of epigrams ;— as Thomas Picke , who belonged to the Middle Temple , and published , in 1631 , a number of songs , sonnets , and elegies ;— as Henry Constable , born in 1568 , and a well-known sonneteer of his day ;— as Nicholas Breton , author of some pretty pastorals , who , it is conjectured , was born in 1555 , and died in 1624 ;— and as Dr Thomas Lodge , born in 1556 , and who died in 1625 , after translating Josephus into English , and writing some tolerable poetical pieces .</p>
   <p>THOMAS RANDOLPH .</p>
   <p>This was a true poet , although his power comes forth principally in the drama . He was born at Newnham , near Daventry , Northamptonshire , in 1605 , being the you of Lord Zouch 's steward . He became a King 's Scholar at Westminster , and subsequently a Fellow in Trinity College , Cambridge . Ben Jonson loved him , and he reciprocated the attachment . Whether from natural tendency or in imitation of Jonson , who called him , as well as Cartwright , his adopted son , he learned intemperate habits , and died , in 1634 , at the age of twenty-nine . His death took place at the house of W. Stafford , Esq . of Blatherwyke , in his native county , and he was buried in the church beside , where Sir Christopher , afterwards Lord Hatton , signalised the spot of his rest by a monument . He wrote five dramas , which are imperfect and formal in plan , but written with considerable power . Some of his miscellaneous poems discover feeling and genius .</p>

    <head>ROBERT BURTON .</head>
    <head>The great , though whimsical author of the ‘ Anatomy of Melancholy ’ was born at Lindley , in Leicestershire , 1576 , and educated at Christ Church , Oxford . He became Rector of Seagrave , in his native shire . He was a man of vast erudition , of integrity and benevolence , but his happiness , like that of Burns , although in a less measure , ‘ was blasted ab origine by an incurable taint of hypochondria ; ’ and although at times a most delightful companion , at other times he was so miserable , even when a young student at Oxford , that he had no resource but to go down to the river-side , where the coarse jests of the bargemen threw him into fits of laughter . This surely was a violent remedy , and one that must have reacted into deeper depression . In 1621 , he wrote and published , as a safety-valve to his morbid feelings , his famous ‘ Anatomie of Melancholy , by Democritus Junior . ’ It became instantly popular , and sold so well , that the publisher is said to have made a fortune by it . Nothing more of consequence is recorded of the author , who died in 1640 . Although</head>
     <l n="1">‘ Melancholy mark 'd him for her own , ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>she failed to kill him till he had passed his grand climacteric . He was buried in Christ Church , with the following epitaph , said to have been composed by himself :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Paucis notus , paucioribus ignotus .</l>
     <l n="2">Hic jacet Democritus Junior ,</l>
     <l n="3">Cui vitam pariter et mortem</l>
     <l n="4">Dedit Melancholia !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ Known [ by name ] to few , unknown [ as the author of the “ Anatomy ” ] to fewer , here lies D. J ., who owes his death [ as a man ] and his life [ as an author ] to Melancholy . ’</p>
   <p>His work is certainly a most curious and bewitching medley of thought , information , wit , learning , personal interest , and poetic fancy . We all know it was the only book which ever drew the lazy Johnson from his bed an hour sooner than he wished to rise . The subject , like the flesh of that ‘ melancholy ’ creature the hare , may be dry , but , as with that , an astute cookery prevails to make it exceedingly piquant ; the sauce is better than the substance . Burton 's melancholy is not , like Johnson 's , a deep , hopeless , ‘ inspissated gloom , ’ thickened by memories of remorse , and lighted up by the lurid fires of feared perdition ; it is not , like Byron 's , dashed with the demoniac element , and fretted into universal misanthropy ; it is not , like Foster 's , the sad , fixed fascination of a pure intelligence contemplating the darker side of things , as by a necessity of nature , and ignoring , without denying , the existence of the bright ; nor is it , like that of the ‘ melancholy Jacques , ’ in ‘ As you Like it , ’ a wild , woodland , fantastical habit of thought , as of one living collaterally and aside to the world , and which often explodes into laughter at itself and at all things else ;— Burton 's is a wide - spread but tender shade , like twilight , diffused over the whole horizon of his thought , and is nourished at times into a luxury , and at times paraded as a peculiar possession . In his form of melancholy there are pleasures as well as pains . ‘ Most pleasant it is , ’ he says , ‘ to such as are to melancholy given , to lie in bed whole days and keep their chambers ; to walk alone in some solitary grove , betwixt wood and water , by a brook-side , to meditate upon some delightsome and pleasant subject ; and a most incomparable delight it is so to melancholise and build castles in the air . ’ Religious considerations have little to do with Burton 's melancholy , and remorse or fear apparently nothing . Hence his book , although its theme be sadness , never shadows the spirit , but , on the contrary , from his dark , Lethean poppies , his readers are made to extract an element of joyful excitement , and the anatomy , and the cure , of the evil , are one and the same .</p>
   <p>As a writer , Burton ranks , in some points , with Montaigne , and in others with Sir Thomas Browne . He resembles the first in simplicity , bonhommie , and miscellaneous learning , and the other in rambling manner , quaint phraseology , and fantastic imagination . Neither of the three could be said to write books , but they accumulated vast storehouses , whence thousands of volumes might be , and have been compiled . There is nothing in Burton so low as in many of the ‘ Essays ’ of Montaigne , but there is nothing so lofty as in passages of Browne 's ‘ Religio Medici ’ and ‘ Urn-Burial . ’ Burton has been a favourite quarry to literary thieves , among whom Sterne , in his ‘ Tristram Shandy , ’ stands pre-eminent . To his ‘ Anatomy ’ he prefixes a poem , a few stanzas of which we extract .</p>

   <p>THOMAS CAREW .</p>
   <p>This delectable versifier was born in 1589 , in Gloucestershire , from an old family in which he sprung . He was educated at Corpus Christi College , Oxford , but neither matriculated nor took a degree . After finishing his travels , he returned to England , and became soon highly distinguished , in the Court of Charles I ., for his manners , accomplishments , and wit . He was appointed Gentleman of the Privy Chamber and Sewer in Ordinary to the King . He spent the rest of his life as a gay and gallant courtier ; and in the intervals of pleasure produced some light but exquisite poetry . He is said , ere his death , which took place in 1639 , to have become very devout , and bitterly to have deplored the licentiousness of some of his verses .</p>
   <p>Indelicate choice of subject is often , in Carew , combined with great delicacy of execution . No one touches dangerous themes with so light and glove-guarded a hand . His pieces are all fugitive , but they suggest great possibilities , which his mode of life and his premature removal did not permit to be realised . Had he , at an earlier period , renounced , like George Herbert , ‘ the painted pleasures of a court , ’ and , like Prospero , dedicated himself to ‘ closeness , ’ with his marvellous facility of verse , his laboured levity of style , and his nice exuberance of fancy , he might have produced some work of Horatian merit and classic permanence .</p>

   <p>SIR JOHN SUCKLING .</p>
   <p>This witty baronet was born in 1608 . He was the son of the Comptroller of the Household of Charles I . He was uncommonly precocious ; at five is said to have spoken Latin , and at sixteen had entered into the service of Gustavus Adolphus , ‘ the lion of the North , and the bulwark of the Protestant faith . ’</p>
   <p>On his return to England , he was favoured by Charles , and became , in his turn , a most enthusiastic supporter of the Royal cause ; writing plays for the amusement of the Court ; and when the Civil War broke out , raising , at his own expense of £ 1200 , a regiment for the King , which is said to have been distinguished only by its ‘ finery and cowardice . ’ When the Earl of Strafford came into trouble , Suckling , along with some other cavaliers , intrigued for his deliverance , was impeached by the House of Commons , and had to flee to France . Here an early death awaited him . His servant having robbed him , he drew on , in vehement haste , his boots , to pursue the defaulter , when a rusty nail , or , some say , the blade of a knife , which was concealed in one of them , pierced his heel . A mortification ensued , and he died , in 1641 , at thirty-three years of age .</p>
   <p>Suckling has written five plays , various poems , besides letters , speeches , and tracts , which have all been collected into one thin volume . They are of various merit ; none , in fact , being worthy of print , or at least of preservation , except one or two of his songs , and his ‘ Ballad upon a Wedding ’ . This last is an admirable expression of what were his principal qualities — naiveté , sly humour , gay badinage , and a delicious vein of fancy , coming out occasionally by stealth , even as in his own exquisite lines about the bride ,</p>

   <p>WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT .</p>
   <p>Cartwright was born in 1611 , and was the son of an innkeeper — once a gentleman — in Cirencester . He became a King 's scholar at Westminster , and afterwards took orders at Oxford , where he distinguished himself , according to Wood , as a ‘ most florid and seraphic preacher . ’ One is reminded of the description given of Jeremy Taylor , who , when he first began to preach , by his ‘ young and florid beauty , and his sublime and raised discourses , made men take him for an angel newly descended from the climes of Paradise . ’ Cartwright was appointed , through his friend Bishop Duppa , Succentor of the Church of Salisbury in 1642 . He was one of a council of war appointed by the University of Oxford , for providing troops in the King 's cause , to protect , or some said to overawe , the Universities . He was imprisoned by the Parliamentary forces on account of his zeal in the Royal cause , but soon liberated on bail . In 1643 , he was appointed Junior Proctor of his University , and also Reader in Metaphysics . At this time he is said to have studied sixteen hours a-day . This , however , seems to have weakened his constitution , and rendered him an easy victim to what was called the camp-fever , then prevalent in Oxford . He died December 23 , 1643 , aged thirty-two . The King , then in Oxford , went into mourning for him . His works were published in 1651 , and to them were prefixed fifty copies of encomiastic verses from the wits and poets of the time . They scarcely justify the praises they have received , being somewhat crude and harsh , and all of them occasional . His private character , his eloquence as a preacher , and his zeal as a Royalist , seem to have supplemented his claims as a poet . He enjoyed , too , in his earlier life , the friendship of Ben Jonson , who used to say of him , ‘ My son Cartwright writes all like a man ; ’ and such a sentence from such an authority was at that time fame .</p>

   <p>WILLIAM BROWNE .</p>
   <p>This pastoral poet was born , in 1590 , at Tavistock , in Devonshire , a lovely part of a lovely county . He was educated at Oxford , and went thence to the Inner Temple . He was at one time tutor to the Earl of Carnarvon , and afterwards , when that nobleman perished in the battle of Newbury , in 1643 , he was patronised by the Earl of Pembroke , in whose house he resided , and is even said to have become so rich that he purchased an estate . In 1645 he died , at Ottery St Mary , the parish where , in 1772 , Coleridge was born .</p>
   <p>Browne began his poetical career early , and closed it soon . He published the first part of ‘ Britannia 's Pastorals ’ in 1613 , the second in 1616 ; shortly after , his ‘ Shepherd 's Pipe ; ’ and , in 1620 , produced his ‘ Inner Temple Masque ’ which was then enacted , but not printed till a hundred and twenty years after the author 's death , when Dr Farmer transcribed it from a MS. of the Bodleian Library , and it appeared in Tom Davies ’ edition of Browne 's poems . Browne has no constructive power , and no human interest in his pastorals , but he has an eye for nature , and we quote from him some excellent specimens of descriptive poetry .</p>

   <p>WILLIAM ALEXANDER , EARL OF STIRLING .</p>
   <p>This eminent Scotchman was born in 1580 . He travelled on the Continent as tutor to the Duke of Argyle . After his return to Scotland , he fell in love with a lady , whom he calls ‘ Aurora , ’ and to whom he addressed some beautiful sonnets . She refused his hand , however , and he married the daughter of Sir William Erskine . He repaired to the Court of James I ., and became a distinguished favourite , being appointed Gentleman Usher to Charles I ., and created a knight . He concocted a scheme for colonising Nova Scotia , in which he was encouraged by both James and Charles ; but the difficulties seemed too formidable , and it was in consequence dropped . Charles appointed him Lord-Lieutenant of Nova Scotia , and , in 1633 , he created him Lord Stirling . Fifteen years ( from 1626 to 1641 ) our poet was Secretary of State for Scotland . These were the years during which Laud was foolishly seeking to force his liturgy upon the Presbyterians , but Stirling gained the praise of being moderate in his share of the business . In the course of this time he contrived to amass an ample fortune , and spent part of it in building a fine mansion in Stirling , which is still , we believe , standing . He died in 1641 .</p>
   <p>Besides his smaller pieces , Stirling wrote several tragedies , including one on Julius Caesar ; an heroic poem ; a poem addressed to Prince Henry , the son of James I .; another heroic poem , entitled ‘ Jonathan ; ’ and a poem , in twelve parts , on the ‘ Day of Judgment . ’ These are all forgotten , and , notwithstanding vigorous parts , deserve to be forgotten ; but his little sonnets , which are , if not brilliant , true things , and inspired by a true passion , may long survive . He was , on the whole , rather a man of great talent than of genius .</p>

   <p>WILLIAM DRUMMOND .</p>
   <p>A man of much finer gifts than Stirling , was the famous Drummond . He was born , December 13 , 1585 , at Hawthornden , his father 's estate , in Mid - Lothian . It is one of the most beautiful spots , along the sides of one of the fairest streams in all Scotland , and well fitted to be the home of genius . He studied civil law for four years in France , but , in 1611 , the estate of Hawthornden became his own , and here he fixed his residence , and applied himself to literature . At this time he courted , and was upon the point of marrying , a lady named Cunningham , who died ; and the melancholy which preyed on his mind after this event , drove him abroad in search of solace . He visited Italy , Germany , and France ; and during his eight years of residence on the Continent , used his time well , conversing with the learned , admiring all that was admirable in the scenery and the life of foreign lands , and collecting rare books and manuscripts . He had , before his departure , published , first , a volume of occasional poems ; next , a moral treatise , in prose , entitled , ‘ The Cypress Grove ; ’ and then another work , in verse , ‘ The Flowers of Zion . ’ Returned once more to Scotland , he retired to the seat of his brother - in-law , Sir John Scott of Scotstarvet , and there wrote a ‘ History of the Five James 's of Scotland , ’ a book abounding in bombast and slavish principles . When he returned to his own lovely Hawthornden , he met a lady named Logan , of the house of Restalrig , whom he fancied to bear a striking resemblance to his dead mistress . On that hint he spake , and she became his wife . He proceeded to repair the house of Hawthornden , and would have spent his days there in great peace , had it not been for the distracted times . His politics were of the Royalist complexion ; and the party in power , belonging to the Presbyterians , used every method to annoy him , compelling him , for instance , to furnish his quota of men and arms to support the cause which he opposed . In 1619 , Ben Jonson visited him at Hawthornden . The pair were not well assorted . Brawny Ben and dreaming Drummond seem , in the expressive coinage of De Quincey , to have ‘ interdespised ; ’ and is not their feud , with all its circumstances , recorded in the chronicles of the ‘ Quarrels of Authors ’ compiled by the elder Disraeli ? The death of a lady sent Drummond travelling over Europe — the death of a King sent him away on a farther and a final journey . His grief for the execution of Charles I. is said to have shortened his days . At all events , in December of the year of the so-called ‘ Martyrdom , ’ ( 1649 ,) he breathed his last .</p>
   <p>He was a genuine poet as well as a brilliant humorist . His ‘ Polemo Middinia , ’ a grotesque mixture of bad Latin and semi-Latinised Scotch , has created , among many generations , inextinguishable laughter . His ‘ Wandering Muses ; or , The River of Forth Feasting , ’ has some gorgeous descriptions , particularly of Scotland 's lakes and rivers , at a time when</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ She lay , like some unkenn 'd of isle ,</l>
     <l n="2">Ayont New Holland ; ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>but his sonnets are unquestionably his finest productions . They breathe a spirit of genuine poetry . Each one of them is a rose lightly wet with the dew of tenderness , and one or two suggest irresistibly the recollection of our Great Dramatist 's sonnets , although we feel that ‘ a less than Shakspeare is here . ’</p>

   <p>PHINEAS FLETCHER</p>
   <p>We have already spoken of Giles Fletcher , the brother of Phineas . Of Phineas we know nothing except that he was born in 1584 , educated at Eton and Cambridge , became Rector at Hilgay , in Norfolk , where he remained for twenty-nine years , surviving his brother ; that he wrote an account of the founders and learned men of his university ; that in 1633 , he published ‘ The Purple Island ; ’ and that in 1650 he died .</p>
   <p>His ‘ Purple Island ’ ( with which we first became acquainted in the writings of James Hervey , author of the ‘ Meditations , ’ who was its fervent admirer ) is a curious , complex , and highly ingenious allegory , forming an elaborate picture of Man , in his body and soul ; and for subtlety and infinite flexibility , both of fancy and verse , deserves great praise , although it cannot , for a moment , be compared with his brother 's ‘ Christ 's Victory and Triumph , ’ either in interest of subject or in splendour of genius .</p>

     <l n="110">Stoop now thy wing , my muse , now stoop thee low :</l>
     <l n="111">Hence mayst thou freely play , and rest thee now ;</l>
     <l n="112">While here I hang my pipe upon the willow bough .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="113">So up they rose , while all the shepherds ’ throng</l>
     <l n="114">With their loud pipes a country triumph blew ,</l>
     <l n="115">And led their Thirsil home with joyful song :</l>
     <l n="116">Meantime the lovely nymphs , with garlands new</l>
     <l n="117">His locks in bay and honour 'd palm-tree bound ,</l>
     <l n="118">With lilies set , and hyacinths around ,</l>
     <l n="119">And lord of all the year and their May sportings crown 'd .</l>
