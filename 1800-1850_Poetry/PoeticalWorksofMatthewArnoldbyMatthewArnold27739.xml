      <head>A DREAM</head>
       <l n="1">Was it a dream ? We sail 'd , I thought we sail 'd ,</l>
       <l n="2">Martin and I , down a green Alpine stream ,</l>
       <l n="3">Border 'd , each bank , with pines ; the morning sun ,</l>
       <l n="4">On the wet umbrage of their glossy tops ,</l>
       <l n="5">On the red pinings of their forest-floor ,</l>
       <l n="6">Drew a warm scent abroad ; behind the pines</l>
       <l n="7">The mountain-skirts , with all their sylvan change</l>
       <l n="8">Of bright-leaf 'd chestnuts and moss 'd walnut-trees</l>
       <l n="9">And the frail scarlet-berried ash , began .</l>
       <l n="10">Swiss chalets glitter 'd on the dewy slopes ,</l>
       <l n="11">And from some swarded shelf , high up , there came</l>
       <l n="12">Notes of wild pastoral music — over all</l>
       <l n="13">Ranged , diamond-bright , the eternal wall of snow .</l>
       <l n="14">Upon the mossy rocks at the stream 's edge ,</l>
       <l n="15">Back 'd by the pines , a plank-built cottage stood ,</l>
       <l n="16">Bright in the sun ; the climbing gourd-plant 's leaves</l>
       <l n="17">Muffled its walls , and on the stone-strewn roof</l>
       <l n="18">Lay the warm golden gourds ; golden , within ,</l>
       <l n="19">Under the eaves , peer 'd rows of Indian corn .</l>
       <l n="20">We shot beneath the cottage with the stream .</l>
       <l n="21">On the brown , rude-carved balcony , two forms</l>
       <l n="22">Came forth — Olivia 's , Marguerite ! and thine .</l>
       <l n="23">Clad were they both in white , flowers in their breast ;</l>
       <l n="24">Straw hats bedeck 'd their heads , with ribbons blue ,</l>
       <l n="25">Which danced , and on their shoulders , fluttering , play 'd .</l>
       <l n="26">They saw us , they conferr 'd ; their bosoms heaved ,</l>
       <l n="27">And more than mortal impulse fill 'd their eyes .</l>
       <l n="28">Their lips moved ; their white arms , waved eagerly ,</l>
       <l n="29">Flash 'd once , like falling streams ; we rose , we gazed .</l>
       <l n="30">One moment , on the rapid 's top , our boat</l>
       <l n="31">Hung poised — and then the darting river of Life</l>
       <l n="32">( Such now , methought , it was ) , the river of Life ,</l>
       <l n="33">Loud thundering , bore us by ; swift , swift it foam 'd ,</l>
       <l n="34">Black under cliffs it raced , round headlands shone .</l>
       <l n="35">Soon the plank 'd cottage by the sun-warm 'd pines</l>
       <l n="36">Faded — the moss — the rocks ; us burning plains ,</l>
       <l n="37">Bristled with cities , us the sea received .</l>

      <head>RESIGNATION</head>
      <head>TO FAUSTA</head>

       <l n="1">To die be given us , or attain !</l>
       <l n="2">Fierce work it were , to do again .</l>
       <l n="3">So pilgrims , bound for Mecca , pray 'd</l>
       <l n="4">At burning noon ; so warriors said ,</l>
       <l n="5">Scarf 'd with the cross , who watch 'd the miles</l>
       <l n="6">Of dust which wreathed their struggling files</l>
       <l n="7">Down Lydian mountains ; so , when snows</l>
       <l n="8">Round Alpine summits , eddying , rose ,</l>
       <l n="9">The Goth , bound Rome-wards ; so the Hun ,</l>
       <l n="10">Crouch 'd on his saddle , while the sun</l>
       <l n="11">Went lurid down o'er flooded plains</l>
       <l n="12">Through which the groaning Danube strains</l>
       <l n="13">To the drear Euxine ;— so pray all ,</l>
       <l n="14">Whom labours , self-ordain 'd , enthrall ;</l>
       <l n="15">Because they to themselves propose</l>
       <l n="16">On this side the all-common close</l>
       <l n="17">A goal which , gain 'd , may give repose .</l>
       <l n="18">So pray they ; and to stand again</l>
       <l n="19">Where they stood once , to them were pain ;</l>
       <l n="20">Pain to thread back and to renew</l>
       <l n="21">Past straits , and currents long steer 'd through .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="22">But milder natures , and more free —</l>
       <l n="23">Whom an unblamed serenity</l>
       <l n="24">Hath freed from passions , and the state</l>
       <l n="25">Of struggle these necessitate ;</l>
       <l n="26">Whom schooling of the stubborn mind</l>
       <l n="27">Hath made , or birth hath found , resign 'd —</l>
       <l n="28">These mourn not , that their goings pay</l>
       <l n="29">Obedience to the passing day .</l>
       <l n="30">These claim not every laughing Hour</l>
       <l n="31">For handmaid to their striding power ;</l>
       <l n="32">Each in her turn , with torch uprear 'd ,</l>
       <l n="33">To await their march ; and when appear 'd ,</l>
       <l n="34">Through the cold gloom , with measured race ,</l>
       <l n="35">To usher for a destined space</l>
       <l n="36">( Her own sweet errands all forgone )</l>
       <l n="37">The too imperious traveller on .</l>
       <l n="38">These , Fausta , ask not this ; nor thou ,</l>

       <l n="40">We left , just ten years since , you say ,</l>
       <l n="41">That wayside inn we left to-day .<span corresp="#note5" type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span></l>
       <l n="42">Our jovial host , as forth we fare ,</l>
       <l n="43">Shouts greeting from his easy chair .</l>
       <l n="44">High on a bank our leader stands ,</l>
       <l n="45">Reviews and ranks his motley bands ,</l>
       <l n="46">Makes clear our goal to every eye —</l>
       <l n="47">The valley 's western boundary .</l>
       <l n="48">A gate swings to ! our tide hath flow 'd</l>
       <l n="49">Already from the silent road .</l>
       <l n="50">The valley-pastures , one by one ,</l>
       <l n="51">Are threaded , quiet in the sun ;</l>
       <l n="52">And now beyond the rude stone bridge</l>
       <l n="53">Slopes gracious up the western ridge .</l>
       <l n="54">Its woody border , and the last</l>
       <l n="55">Of its dark upland farms is past —</l>
       <l n="56">Cool farms , with open-lying stores ,</l>
       <l n="57">Under their burnish 'd sycamores ;</l>
       <l n="58">All past ! and through the trees we glide ,</l>
       <l n="59">Emerging on the green hill-side .</l>
       <l n="60">There climbing hangs , a far-seen sign ,</l>
       <l n="61">Our wavering , many-colour 'd line ;</l>
       <l n="62">There winds , upstreaming slowly still</l>
       <l n="63">Over the summit of the hill .</l>
       <l n="64">And now , in front , behold outspread</l>
       <l n="65">Those upper regions we must tread !</l>
       <l n="66">Mild hollows , and clear heathy swells ,</l>
       <l n="67">The cheerful silence of the fells .</l>
       <l n="68">Some two hours ’ march with serious air ,</l>
       <l n="69">Through the deep noontide heats we fare ;</l>
       <l n="70">The red-grouse , springing at our sound ,</l>
       <l n="71">Skims , now and then , the shining ground ;</l>
       <l n="72">No life , save his and ours , intrudes</l>
       <l n="73">Upon these breathless solitudes .</l>
       <l n="74">O joy ! again the farms appear .</l>
       <l n="75">Cool shade is there , and rustic cheer ;</l>
       <l n="76">There springs the brook will guide us down ,</l>
       <l n="77">Bright comrade , to the noisy town .</l>
       <l n="78">Lingering , we follow down ; we gain</l>
       <l n="79">The town , the highway , and the plain .</l>
       <l n="80">And many a mile of dusty way ,</l>
       <l n="81">Parch 'd and road-worn , we made that day ;</l>
       <l n="82">But , Fausta , I remember well ,</l>
       <l n="83">That as the balmy darkness fell</l>
       <l n="84">We bathed our hands with speechless glee ,</l>
       <l n="85">That night , in the wide-glimmering sea .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="86">Once more we tread this self-same road ,</l>
       <l n="87">Fausta , which ten years since we trod ;</l>
       <l n="88">Alone we tread it , you and I ,</l>
       <l n="89">Ghosts of that boisterous company .</l>
       <l n="90">Here , where the brook shines , near its head ,</l>
       <l n="91">In its clear , shallow , turf-fringed bed ;</l>
       <l n="92">Here , whence the eye first sees , far down ,</l>
       <l n="93">Capp 'd with faint smoke , the noisy town ;</l>
       <l n="94">Here sit we , and again unroll ,</l>
       <l n="95">Though slowly , the familiar whole .</l>
       <l n="96">The solemn wastes of heathy hill</l>
       <l n="97">Sleep in the July sunshine still ;</l>
       <l n="98">The self-same shadows now , as then ,</l>
       <l n="99">Play through this grassy upland glen ;</l>
       <l n="100">The loose dark stones on the green way</l>
       <l n="101">Lie strewn , it seems , where then they lay ;</l>
       <l n="102">On this mild bank above the stream ,</l>
       <l n="103">( You crush them ! ) the blue gentians gleam .</l>
       <l n="104">Still this wild brook , the rushes cool ,</l>
       <l n="105">The sailing foam , the shining pool !</l>
       <l n="106">These are not changed ; and we , you say ,</l>
       <l n="107">Are scarce more changed , in truth , than they .</l>

       <l n="108">The gipsies , whom we met below ,</l>
       <l n="109">They , too , have long roam 'd to and fro ;</l>
       <l n="110">They ramble , leaving , where they pass ,</l>
       <l n="111">Their fragments on the cumber 'd grass .</l>
       <l n="112">And often to some kindly place</l>
       <l n="113">Chance guides the migratory race ,</l>
       <l n="114">Where , though long wanderings intervene ,</l>
       <l n="115">They recognise a former scene .</l>
       <l n="116">The dingy tents are pitch 'd ; the fires</l>
       <l n="117">Give to the wind their wavering spires ;</l>
       <l n="118">In dark knots crouch round the wild flame</l>
       <l n="119">Their children , as when first they came ;</l>
       <l n="120">They see their shackled beasts again</l>
       <l n="121">Move , browsing , up the gray-wall 'd lane .</l>
       <l n="122">Signs are not wanting , which might raise</l>
       <l n="123">The ghost in them of former days —</l>
       <l n="124">Signs are not wanting , if they would ;</l>
       <l n="125">Suggestions to disquietude .</l>
       <l n="126">For them , for all , time 's busy touch ,</l>
       <l n="127">While it mends little , troubles much .</l>
       <l n="128">Their joints grow stiffer — but the year</l>
       <l n="129">Runs his old round of dubious cheer ;</l>
       <l n="130">Chilly they grow — yet winds in March ,</l>
       <l n="131">Still , sharp as ever , freeze and parch ;</l>
       <l n="132">They must live still — and yet , God knows ,</l>
       <l n="133">Crowded and keen the country grows ;</l>
       <l n="134">It seems as if , in their decay ,</l>
       <l n="135">The law grew stronger every day .</l>
       <l n="136">So might they reason , so compare ,</l>
       <l n="137">Fausta , times past with times that are .</l>
       <l n="138">But no !— they rubb 'd through yesterday</l>
       <l n="139">In their hereditary way ,</l>
       <l n="140">And they will rub through , if they can ,</l>
       <l n="141">To-morrow on the self-same plan ,</l>
       <l n="142">Till death arrive to supersede ,</l>

       <l n="144">The poet , to whose mighty heart</l>
       <l n="145">Heaven doth a quicker pulse impart ,</l>

       <l n="147">Not his own course , but that of man .</l>
       <l n="148">Though he move mountains , though his day</l>

       <l n="163">Is in their far-off triumphs proud .</l>
       <l n="164">From some high station he looks down ,</l>
       <l n="165">At sunset , on a populous town ;</l>
       <l n="166">Surveys each happy group , which fleets ,</l>
       <l n="167">Toil ended , through the shining streets ,</l>
       <l n="168">Each with some errand of its own —</l>
       <l n="169">And does not say : I am alone .</l>
       <l n="170">He sees the gentle stir of birth</l>
       <l n="171">When morning purifies the earth ;</l>
       <l n="172">He leans upon a gate and sees</l>
       <l n="173">The pastures , and the quiet trees .</l>
       <l n="174">Low , woody hill , with gracious bound ,</l>
       <l n="175">Folds the still valley almost round ;</l>
       <l n="176">The cuckoo , loud on some high lawn ,</l>
       <l n="177">Is answer 'd from the depth of dawn ;</l>
       <l n="178">In the hedge straggling to the stream ,</l>
       <l n="179">Pale , dew-drench 'd , half-shut roses gleam ;</l>
       <l n="180">But , where the farther side slopes down ,</l>
       <l n="181">He sees the drowsy new-waked clown</l>
       <l n="182">In his white quaint-embroider 'd frock</l>
       <l n="183">Make , whistling , tow'rd his mist-wreathed flock —</l>
       <l n="184">Slowly , behind his heavy tread ,</l>
       <l n="185">The wet , flower 'd grass heaves up its head .</l>
       <l n="186">Lean 'd on his gate , he gazes — tears</l>
       <l n="187">Are in his eyes , and in his ears</l>
       <l n="188">The murmur of a thousand years .</l>
       <l n="189">Before him he sees life unroll ,</l>
       <l n="190">A placid and continuous whole —</l>
       <l n="191">That general life , which does not cease ,</l>
       <l n="192">Whose secret is not joy , but peace ;</l>
       <l n="193">That life , whose dumb wish is not miss 'd</l>
       <l n="194">If birth proceeds , if things subsist ;</l>
       <l n="195">The life of plants , and stones , and rain ,</l>

       <l n="197">Fate gave , what chance shall not control ,</l>

      <head>AN EPISODE</head>
       <l n="1">And the first grey of morning fill 'd the east ,</l>
       <l n="2">And the fog rose out of the Oxus stream .</l>
       <l n="3">But all the Tartar camp along the stream</l>
       <l n="4">Was hush 'd , and still the men were plunged in sleep ;</l>
       <l n="5">Sohrab alone , he slept not ; all night long</l>
       <l n="6">He had lain wakeful , tossing on his bed ;</l>
       <l n="7">But when the grey dawn stole into his tent ,</l>
       <l n="8">He rose , and clad himself , and girt his sword ,</l>
       <l n="9">And took his horseman 's cloak , and left his tent ,</l>
       <l n="10">And went abroad into the cold wet fog ,</l>
       <l n="11">Through the dim camp to Peran-Wisa 's tent .</l>
       <l n="12">Through the black Tartar tents he pass 'd , which stood</l>
       <l n="13">Clustering like bee-hives on the low flat strand</l>
       <l n="14">Of Oxus , where the summer-floods o'erflow</l>
       <l n="15">When the sun melts the snows in high Pamere ;</l>
       <l n="16">Through the black tents he pass 'd , o'er that low strand ,</l>
       <l n="17">And to a hillock came , a little back</l>
       <l n="18">From the stream 's brink — the spot where first a boat ,</l>
       <l n="19">Crossing the stream in summer , scrapes the land .</l>
       <l n="20">The men of former times had crown 'd the top</l>
       <l n="21">With a clay fort ; but that was fall'n , and now</l>
       <l n="22">The Tartars built there Peran-Wisa 's tent ,</l>
       <l n="23">A dome of laths , and o'er it felts were spread .</l>
       <l n="24">And Sohrab came there , and went in , and stood</l>
       <l n="25">Upon the thick piled carpets in the tent ,</l>
       <l n="26">And found the old man sleeping on his bed</l>
       <l n="27">Of rugs and felts , and near him lay his arms .</l>
       <l n="28">And Peran-Wisa heard him , though the step</l>
       <l n="29">Was dull 'd ; for he slept light , an old man 's sleep ;</l>
       <l n="30">And he rose quickly on one arm , and said :—</l>
       <l n="31">“ Who art thou ? for it is not yet clear dawn .</l>
       <l n="32">Speak ! is there news , or any night alarm ? ”</l>
       <l n="33">But Sohrab came to the bedside , and said :—</l>
       <l n="34">“ Thou know'st me , Peran-Wisa ! it is I .</l>
       <l n="35">The sun is not yet risen , and the foe</l>
       <l n="36">Sleep ; but I sleep not ; all night long I lie</l>
       <l n="37">Tossing and wakeful , and I come to thee .</l>
       <l n="38">For so did King Afrasiab bid me seek</l>
       <l n="39">Thy counsel , and to heed thee as thy son ,</l>
       <l n="40">In Samarcand , before the army march 'd ;</l>
       <l n="41">And I will tell thee what my heart desires .</l>
       <l n="42">Thou know'st if , since from Ader-baijan first</l>
       <l n="43">I came among the Tartars and bore arms ,</l>
       <l n="44">I have still served Afrasiab well , and shown ,</l>
       <l n="45">At my boy 's years , the courage of a man .</l>
       <l n="46">This too thou know'st , that while I still bear on</l>
       <l n="47">The conquering Tartar ensigns through the world ,</l>
       <l n="48">And beat the Persians back on every field ,</l>
       <l n="49">I seek one man , one man , and one alone —</l>
       <l n="50">Rustum , my father ; who I hoped should greet ,</l>
       <l n="51">Should one day greet , upon some well-fought field ,</l>
       <l n="52">His not unworthy , not inglorious son .</l>
       <l n="53">So I long hoped , but him I never find .</l>
       <l n="54">Come then , hear now , and grant me what I ask .</l>
       <l n="55">Let the two armies rest to-day ; but I</l>
       <l n="56">Will challenge forth the bravest Persian lords</l>
       <l n="57">To meet me , man to man ; if I prevail ,</l>
       <l n="58">Rustum will surely hear it ; if I fall —</l>
       <l n="59">Old man , the dead need no one , claim no kin .</l>
       <l n="60">Dim is the rumour of a common fight ,</l>
       <l n="61">Where host meets host , and many names are sunk ;</l>
       <l n="62">But of a single combat fame speaks clear . ”</l>
       <l n="63">He spoke ; and Peran-Wisa took the hand</l>
       <l n="64">Of the young man in his , and sigh 'd , and said :—</l>
       <l n="65">“ O Sohrab , an unquiet heart is thine !</l>
       <l n="66">Canst thou not rest among the Tartar chiefs ,</l>
       <l n="67">And share the battle 's common chance with us</l>
       <l n="68">Who love thee , but must press for ever first ,</l>
       <l n="69">In single fight incurring single risk ,</l>
       <l n="70">To find a father thou hast never seen ?</l>
       <l n="71">That were far best , my son , to stay with us</l>
       <l n="72">Unmurmuring ; in our tents , while it is war ,</l>
       <l n="73">And when ‘ tis truce , then in Afrasiab 's towns .</l>
       <l n="74">But , if this one desire indeed rules all ,</l>
       <l n="75">To seek out Rustum — seek him not through fight !</l>
       <l n="76">Seek him in peace , and carry to his arms ,</l>
       <l n="77">O Sohrab , carry an unwounded son !</l>
       <l n="78">But far hence seek him , for he is not here .</l>
       <l n="79">For now it is not as when I was young ,</l>
       <l n="80">When Rustum was in front of every fray ;</l>
       <l n="81">But now he keeps apart , and sits at home ,</l>
       <l n="82">In Seistan , with Zal , his father old .</l>
       <l n="83">Whether that his own mighty strength at last</l>
       <l n="84">Feels the abhorr 'd approaches of old age ,</l>
       <l n="85">Or in some quarrel with the Persian King .</l>
       <l n="86">There go !— Thou wilt not ? Yet my heart forebodes</l>
       <l n="87">Danger or death awaits thee on this field .</l>
       <l n="88">Fain would I know thee safe and well , though lost</l>
       <l n="89">To us ; fain therefore send thee hence , in peace</l>
       <l n="90">To seek thy father , not seek single fights</l>
       <l n="91">In vain ;— but who can keep the lion 's cub</l>
       <l n="92">From ravening , and who govern Rustum 's son ?</l>
       <l n="93">Go , I will grant thee what thy heart desires . ”</l>
       <l n="94">So said he , and dropp 'd Sohrab 's hand , and left</l>
       <l n="95">His bed , and the warm rugs whereon he lay ;</l>
       <l n="96">And o'er his chilly limbs his woollen coat</l>
       <l n="97">He pass 'd , and tied his sandals on his feet ,</l>
       <l n="98">And threw a white cloak round him , and he took</l>
       <l n="99">In his right hand a ruler 's staff , no sword ;</l>
       <l n="100">And on his head he set his sheep-skin cap ,</l>
       <l n="101">Black , glossy , curl 'd , the fleece of Kara-Kul ;</l>
       <l n="102">And raised the curtain of his tent , and call 'd</l>
       <l n="103">His herald to his side , and went abroad .</l>
       <l n="104">The sun by this had risen , and clear 'd the fog</l>
       <l n="105">From the broad Oxus and the glittering sands .</l>
       <l n="106">And from their tents the Tartar horsemen filed</l>
       <l n="107">Into the open plain ; so Haman bade —</l>
       <l n="108">Haman , who next to Peran-Wisa ruled</l>
       <l n="109">The host , and still was in his lusty prime .</l>
       <l n="110">From their black tents , long files of horse , they stream 'd ;</l>
       <l n="111">As when some grey November morn the files ,</l>
       <l n="112">In marching order spread , of long-neck 'd cranes</l>
       <l n="113">Stream over Casbin and the southern slopes</l>
       <l n="114">Of Elburz , from the Aralian estuaries ,</l>
       <l n="115">Or some frore Caspian reed-bed , southward bound</l>
       <l n="116">For the warm Persian sea-board — so they stream 'd .</l>
       <l n="117">The Tartars of the Oxus , the King 's guard ,</l>
       <l n="118">First , with black sheep-skin caps and with long spears ;</l>
       <l n="119">Large men , large steeds ; who from Bokhara come</l>
       <l n="120">And Khiva , and ferment the milk of mares .</l>
       <l n="121">Next , the more temperate Toorkmuns of the south ,</l>
       <l n="122">The Tukas , and the lances of Salore ,</l>
       <l n="123">And those from Attruck and the Caspian sands ;</l>
       <l n="124">Light men and on light steeds , who only drink</l>
       <l n="125">The acrid milk of camels , and their wells .</l>
       <l n="126">And then a swarm of wandering horse , who came</l>
       <l n="127">From far , and a more doubtful service own 'd ;</l>
       <l n="128">The Tartars of Ferghana , from the banks</l>
       <l n="129">Of the Jaxartes , men with scanty beards</l>
       <l n="130">And close-set skull-caps ; and those wilder hordes</l>
       <l n="131">Who roam o'er Kipchak and the northern waste ,</l>
       <l n="132">Kalmucks and unkempt Kuzzaks , tribes who stray</l>
       <l n="133">Nearest the Pole , and wandering Kirghizzes ,</l>
       <l n="134">Who come on shaggy ponies from Pamere ;</l>
       <l n="135">These all filed out from camp into the plain .</l>
       <l n="136">And on the other side the Persians form 'd ;—</l>
       <l n="137">First a light cloud of horse , Tartars they seem 'd ,</l>
       <l n="138">The Ilyats of Khorassan ; and behind ,</l>
       <l n="139">The royal troops of Persia , horse and foot ,</l>
       <l n="140">Marshall 'd battalions bright in burnish 'd steel .</l>
       <l n="141">But Peran-Wisa with his herald came ,</l>
       <l n="142">Threading the Tartar squadrons to the front ,</l>
       <l n="143">And with his staff kept back the foremost ranks .</l>
       <l n="144">And when Ferood , who led the Persians , saw</l>
       <l n="145">That Peran-Wisa kept the Tartars back ,</l>
       <l n="146">He took his spear , and to the front he came ,</l>
       <l n="147">And check 'd his ranks , and fix 'd them where they stood .</l>
       <l n="148">And the old Tartar came upon the sand</l>
       <l n="149">Betwixt the silent hosts , and spake , and said :—</l>
       <l n="150">“ Ferood , and ye , Persians and Tartars , hear !</l>
       <l n="151">Let there be truce between the hosts to-day .</l>
       <l n="152">But choose a champion from the Persian lords</l>
       <l n="153">To fight our champion Sohrab , man to man . ”</l>
       <l n="154">As , in the country , on a morn in June ,</l>
       <l n="155">When the dew glistens on the pearled ears ,</l>
       <l n="156">A shiver runs through the deep corn for joy —</l>
       <l n="157">So , when they heard what Peran-Wisa said ,</l>
       <l n="158">A thrill through all the Tartar squadrons ran</l>
       <l n="159">Of pride and hope for Sohrab , whom they loved .</l>
       <l n="160">But as a troop of pedlars , from Cabool ,</l>
       <l n="161">Cross underneath the Indian Caucasus ,</l>
       <l n="162">That vast sky-neighbouring mountain of milk snow ;</l>
       <l n="163">Crossing so high , that , as they mount , they pass</l>
       <l n="164">Long flocks of travelling birds dead on the snow ,</l>
       <l n="165">Choked by the air , and scarce can they themselves</l>
       <l n="166">Slake their parch 'd throats with sugar 'd mulberries —</l>
       <l n="167">In single file they move , and stop their breath ,</l>
       <l n="168">For fear they should dislodge the o'erhanging snows —</l>
       <l n="169">So the pale Persians held their breath with fear .</l>
       <l n="170">And to Ferood his brother chiefs came up</l>
       <l n="171">To counsel ; Gudurz and Zoarrah came ,</l>
       <l n="172">And Feraburz , who ruled the Persian host</l>
       <l n="173">Second , and was the uncle of the King ;</l>
       <l n="174">These came and counsell 'd , and then Gudurz said :—</l>
       <l n="175">“ Ferood , shame bids us take their challenge up ,</l>
       <l n="176">Yet champion have we none to match this youth .</l>
       <l n="177">He has the wild stag 's foot , the lion 's heart .</l>
       <l n="178">But Rustum came last night ; aloof he sits</l>
       <l n="179">And sullen , and has pitch 'd his tents apart .</l>
       <l n="180">Him will I seek , and carry to his ear</l>
       <l n="181">The Tartar challenge , and this young man 's name .</l>
       <l n="182">Haply he will forget his wrath , and fight .</l>
       <l n="183">Stand forth the while , and take their challenge up . ”</l>
       <l n="184">So spake he ; and Ferood stood forth and cried :—</l>
       <l n="185">“ Old man , be it agreed as thou hast said !</l>
       <l n="186">Let Sohrab arm , and we will find a man . ”</l>
       <l n="187">He spake : and Peran-Wisa turn 'd , and strode</l>
       <l n="188">Back through the opening squadrons to his tent .</l>
       <l n="189">But through the anxious Persians Gudurz ran ,</l>
       <l n="190">And cross 'd the camp which lay behind , and reach 'd ,</l>
       <l n="191">Out on the sands beyond it , Rustum 's tents .</l>
       <l n="192">Of scarlet cloth they were , and glittering gay ,</l>
       <l n="193">Just pitch 'd ; the high pavilion in the midst</l>
       <l n="194">Was Rustum 's , and his men lay camp 'd around .</l>
       <l n="195">And Gudurz enter 'd Rustum 's tent , and found</l>
       <l n="196">Rustum ; his morning meal was done , but still</l>
       <l n="197">The table stood before him , charged with food —</l>
       <l n="198">A side of roasted sheep , and cakes of bread ,</l>
       <l n="199">And dark green melons ; and there Rustum sate</l>
       <l n="200">Listless , and held a falcon on his wrist ,</l>
       <l n="201">And play 'd with it ; but Gudurz came and stood</l>
       <l n="202">Before him ; and he look 'd , and saw him stand ,</l>
       <l n="203">And with a cry sprang up and dropp 'd the bird ,</l>
       <l n="204">And greeted Gudurz with both hands , and said :—</l>
       <l n="205">“ Welcome ! these eyes could see no better sight .</l>
       <l n="206">What news ? but sit down first , and eat and drink . ”</l>
       <l n="207">But Gudurz stood in the tent-door , and said :—</l>
       <l n="208">“ Not now ! a time will come to eat and drink ,</l>
       <l n="209">But not to-day ; to-day has other needs .</l>
       <l n="210">The armies are drawn out , and stand at gaze ;</l>
       <l n="211">For from the Tartars is a challenge brought</l>
       <l n="212">To pick a champion from the Persian lords</l>
       <l n="213">To fight their champion — and thou know'st his name —</l>
       <l n="214">Sohrab men call him , but his birth is hid .</l>
       <l n="215">O Rustum , like thy might is this young man 's !</l>
       <l n="216">He has the wild stag 's foot , the lion 's heart ;</l>
       <l n="217">And he is young , and Iran 's chiefs are old ,</l>
       <l n="218">Or else too weak ; and all eyes turn to thee .</l>
       <l n="219">Come down and help us , Rustum , or we lose ! ”</l>
       <l n="220">He spoke ; but Rustum answer 'd with a smile :—</l>
       <l n="221">“ Go to ! if Iran 's chiefs are old , then I</l>
       <l n="222">Am older ; if the young are weak , the King</l>
       <l n="223">Errs strangely ; for the King , for Kai Khosroo ,</l>
       <l n="224">Himself is young , and honours younger men ,</l>
       <l n="225">And lets the aged moulder to their graves .</l>
       <l n="226">Rustum he loves no more , but loves the young —</l>
       <l n="227">The young may rise at Sohrab 's vaunts , not I .</l>
       <l n="228">For what care I , though all speak Sohrab 's fame ?</l>
       <l n="229">For would that I myself had such a son ,</l>
       <l n="230">And not that one slight helpless girl I have —</l>
       <l n="231">A son so famed , so brave , to send to war ,</l>
       <l n="232">And I to tarry with the snow-hair 'd Zal ,</l>
       <l n="233">My father , whom the robber Afghans vex ,</l>
       <l n="234">And clip his borders short , and drive his herds ,</l>
       <l n="235">And he has none to guard his weak old age .</l>
       <l n="236">There would I go , and hang my armour up ,</l>
       <l n="237">And with my great name fence that weak old man ,</l>
       <l n="238">And spend the goodly treasures I have got ,</l>
       <l n="239">And rest my age , and hear of Sohrab 's fame ,</l>
       <l n="240">And leave to death the hosts of thankless kings ,</l>
       <l n="241">And with these slaughterous hands draw sword no more . ”</l>
       <l n="242">He spoke , and smiled ; and Gudurz made reply :—</l>
       <l n="243">“ What then , O Rustum , will men say to this ,</l>
       <l n="244">When Sohrab dares our bravest forth , and seeks</l>
       <l n="245">Thee most of all , and thou , whom most he seeks ,</l>
       <l n="246">Hidest thy face ? Take heed lest men should say :</l>
       <l n="247">Like some old miser , Rustum hoards his fame ,</l>
       <l n="248">And shuns to peril it with younger men . ”</l>
       <l n="249">And , greatly moved , then Rustum made reply :—</l>
       <l n="250">“ O Gudurz , wherefore dost thou say such words ?</l>
       <l n="251">Thou knowest better words than this to say .</l>
       <l n="252">What is one more , one less , obscure or famed ,</l>
       <l n="253">Valiant or craven , young or old , to me ?</l>
       <l n="254">Are not they mortal , am not I myself ?</l>
       <l n="255">But who for men of nought would do great deeds ?</l>
       <l n="256">Come , thou shalt see how Rustum hoards his fame !</l>
       <l n="257">But I will fight unknown , and in plain arms ;</l>
       <l n="258">Let not men say of Rustum , he was match 'd</l>
       <l n="259">In single fight with any mortal man . ”</l>
       <l n="260">He spoke , and frown 'd ; and Gudurz turn 'd , and ran</l>
       <l n="261">Back quickly through the camp in fear and joy —</l>
       <l n="262">Fear at his wrath , but joy that Rustum came .</l>
       <l n="263">But Rustum strode to his tent-door , and call 'd</l>
       <l n="264">His followers in , and bade them bring his arms ,</l>
       <l n="265">And clad himself in steel ; the arms he chose</l>
       <l n="266">Were plain , and on his shield was no device ,</l>
       <l n="267">Only his helm was rich , inlaid with gold ,</l>
       <l n="268">And , from the fluted spine atop , a plume</l>
       <l n="269">Of horsehair waved , a scarlet horsehair plume .</l>
       <l n="270">So arm 'd , he issued forth ; and Ruksh , his horse ,</l>
       <l n="271">Follow 'd him like a faithful hound at heel —</l>
       <l n="272">Ruksh , whose renown was noised through all the earth ,</l>
       <l n="273">The horse , whom Rustum on a foray once</l>
       <l n="274">Did in Bokhara by the river find</l>
       <l n="275">A colt beneath its dam , and drove him home ,</l>
       <l n="276">And rear 'd him ; a bright bay , with lofty crest ,</l>
       <l n="277">Dight with a saddle-cloth of broider 'd green</l>
       <l n="278">Crusted with gold , and on the ground were work 'd</l>
       <l n="279">All beasts of chase , all beasts which hunters know .</l>
       <l n="280">So follow 'd , Rustum left his tents , and cross 'd</l>
       <l n="281">The camp , and to the Persian host appear 'd .</l>
       <l n="282">And all the Persians knew him , and with shouts</l>
       <l n="283">Hail 'd ; but the Tartars knew not who he was .</l>
       <l n="284">And dear as the wet diver to the eyes</l>
       <l n="285">Of his pale wife who waits and weeps on shore ,</l>
       <l n="286">By sandy Bahrein , in the Persian Gulf ,</l>
       <l n="287">Plunging all day in the blue waves , at night ,</l>
       <l n="288">Having made up his tale of precious pearls ,</l>
       <l n="289">Rejoins her in their hut upon the sands —</l>
       <l n="290">So dear to the pale Persians Rustum came .</l>
       <l n="291">And Rustum to the Persian front advanced ,</l>
       <l n="292">And Sohrab arm 'd in Haman 's tent , and came .</l>
       <l n="293">And as afield the reapers cut a swath</l>
       <l n="294">Down through the middle of a rich man 's corn ,</l>
       <l n="295">And on each side are squares of standing corn ,</l>
       <l n="296">And in the midst a stubble , short and bare —</l>
       <l n="297">So on each side were squares of men , with spears</l>
       <l n="298">Bristling , and in the midst , the open sand .</l>
       <l n="299">And Rustum came upon the sand , and cast</l>
       <l n="300">His eyes toward the Tartar tents , and saw</l>
       <l n="301">Sohrab come forth , and eyed him as he came .</l>
       <l n="302">As some rich woman , on a winter 's morn ,</l>
       <l n="303">Eyes through her silken curtains the poor drudge</l>
       <l n="304">Who with numb blacken 'd fingers makes her fire —</l>
       <l n="305">At cock-crow , on a starlit winter 's morn ,</l>
       <l n="306">When the frost flowers the whiten 'd window-panes —</l>
       <l n="307">And wonders how she lives , and what the thoughts</l>
       <l n="308">Of that poor drudge may be ; so Rustum eyed</l>
       <l n="309">The unknown adventurous youth , who from afar</l>
       <l n="310">Came seeking Rustum , and defying forth</l>
       <l n="311">All the most valiant chiefs ; long he perused</l>
       <l n="312">His spirited air , and wonder 'd who he was .</l>
       <l n="313">For very young he seem 'd , tenderly rear 'd ;</l>
       <l n="314">Like some young cypress , tall , and dark , and straight ,</l>
       <l n="315">Which in a queen 's secluded garden throws</l>
       <l n="316">Its slight dark shadow on the moonlit turf ,</l>
       <l n="317">By midnight , to a bubbling fountain 's sound —</l>
       <l n="318">So slender Sohrab seem 'd , so softly rear 'd .</l>
       <l n="319">And a deep pity enter 'd Rustum 's soul</l>
       <l n="320">As he beheld him coming ; and he stood ,</l>
       <l n="321">And beckon 'd to him with his hand , and said :—</l>
       <l n="322">“ O thou young man , the air of Heaven is soft ,</l>
       <l n="323">And warm , and pleasant ; but the grave is cold !</l>
       <l n="324">Heaven 's air is better than the cold dead grave .</l>
       <l n="325">Behold me ! I am vast , and clad in iron ,</l>
       <l n="326">And tried ; and I have stood on many a field</l>
       <l n="327">Of blood , and I have fought with many a foe —</l>
       <l n="328">Never was that field lost , or that foe saved .</l>
       <l n="329">O Sohrab , wherefore wilt thou rush on death ?</l>
       <l n="330">Be govern 'd ! quit the Tartar host , and come</l>
       <l n="331">To Iran , and be as my son to me ,</l>
       <l n="332">And fight beneath my banner till I die !</l>
       <l n="333">There are no youths in Iran brave as thou . ”</l>
       <l n="334">So he spake , mildly ; Sohrab heard his voice ,</l>
       <l n="335">The mighty voice of Rustum , and he saw</l>
       <l n="336">His giant figure planted on the sand ,</l>
       <l n="337">Sole , like some single tower , which a chief</l>
       <l n="338">Hath builded on the waste in former years</l>
       <l n="339">Against the robbers ; and he saw that head ,</l>
       <l n="340">Streak 'd with its first grey hairs ;— hope filled his soul ,</l>
       <l n="341">And he ran forward and embraced his knees ,</l>
       <l n="342">And clasp 'd his hand within his own , and said :—</l>
       <l n="343">“ O , by thy father 's head ! by thine own soul !</l>
       <l n="344">Art thou not Rustum ? speak ! art thou not he ? ”</l>
       <l n="345">But Rustum eyed askance the kneeling youth ,</l>
       <l n="346">And turn 'd away , and spake to his own soul :—</l>
       <l n="347">“ Ah me , I muse what this young fox may mean !</l>
       <l n="348">False , wily , boastful , are these Tartar boys .</l>
       <l n="349">For if I now confess this thing he asks ,</l>
       <l n="350">And hide it not , but say : Rustum is here !</l>
       <l n="351">He will not yield indeed , nor quit our foes ,</l>
       <l n="352">But he will find some pretext not to fight ,</l>
       <l n="353">And praise my fame , and proffer courteous gifts</l>
       <l n="354">A belt or sword perhaps , and go his way .</l>
       <l n="355">And on a feast-tide , in Afrasiab 's hall ,</l>
       <l n="356">In Samarcand , he will arise and cry :</l>
       <l n="357">‘ I challenged once , when the two armies camp 'd</l>
       <l n="358">Beside the Oxus , all the Persian lords</l>
       <l n="359">To cope with me in single fight ; but they</l>
       <l n="360">Shrank , only Rustum dared ; then he and I</l>
       <l n="361">Changed gifts , and went on equal terms away . ’</l>
       <l n="362">So will he speak , perhaps , while men applaud ;</l>
       <l n="363">Then were the chiefs of Iran shamed through me . ”</l>
       <l n="364">And then he turn 'd , and sternly spake aloud :—</l>
       <l n="365">“ Rise ! wherefore dost thou vainly question thus</l>
       <l n="366">Of Rustum ? I am here , whom thou hast call 'd</l>
       <l n="367">By challenge forth ; make good thy vaunt , or yield !</l>
       <l n="368">Is it with Rustum only thou wouldst fight ?</l>
       <l n="369">Rash boy , men look on Rustum 's face and flee !</l>
       <l n="370">For well I know , that did great Rustum stand</l>
       <l n="371">Before thy face this day , and were reveal 'd ,</l>
       <l n="372">There would be then no talk of fighting more .</l>
       <l n="373">But being what I am , I tell thee this —</l>
       <l n="374">Do thou record it in thine inmost soul :</l>
       <l n="375">Either thou shalt renounce thy vaunt and yield ,</l>
       <l n="376">Or else thy bones shall strew this sand , till winds</l>
       <l n="377">Bleach them , or Oxus with his summer-floods ,</l>
       <l n="378">Oxus in summer wash them all away . ”</l>
       <l n="379">He spoke ; and Sohrab answer 'd , on his feet :—</l>
       <l n="380">“ Art thou so fierce ? Thou wilt not fright me so !</l>
       <l n="381">I am no girl , to be made pale by words .</l>
       <l n="382">Yet this thou hast said well , did Rustum stand</l>
       <l n="383">Here on this field , there were no fighting then .</l>
       <l n="384">But Rustum is far hence , and we stand here .</l>
       <l n="385">Begin ! thou art more vast , more dread than I ,</l>
       <l n="386">And thou art proved , I know , and I am young —</l>
       <l n="387">But yet success sways with the breath of Heaven .</l>
       <l n="388">And though thou thinkest that thou knowest sure</l>
       <l n="389">Thy victory , yet thou canst not surely know .</l>
       <l n="390">For we are all , like swimmers in the sea ,</l>
       <l n="391">Poised on the top of a huge wave of fate ,</l>
       <l n="392">Which hangs uncertain to which side to fall .</l>
       <l n="393">And whether it will heave us up to land ,</l>
       <l n="394">Or whether it will roll us out to sea ,</l>
       <l n="395">Back out to sea , to the deep waves of death ,</l>
       <l n="396">We know not , and no search will make us know ;</l>
       <l n="397">Only the event will teach us in its hour . ”</l>
       <l n="398">He spoke , and Rustum answer 'd not , but hurl 'd</l>
       <l n="399">His spear ; down from the shoulder , down it came ,</l>
       <l n="400">As on some partridge in the corn a hawk ,</l>
       <l n="401">That long has tower 'd in the airy clouds ,</l>
       <l n="402">Drops like a plummet ; Sohrab saw it come ,</l>
       <l n="403">And sprang aside , quick as a flash ; the spear</l>
       <l n="404">Hiss 'd , and went quivering down into the sand ,</l>
       <l n="405">Which it sent flying wide ;— then Sohrab threw</l>
       <l n="406">In turn , and full struck Rustum 's shield ; sharp rang ,</l>
       <l n="407">The iron plates rang sharp , but turn 'd the spear .</l>
       <l n="408">And Rustum seized his club , which none but he</l>
       <l n="409">Could wield ; an unlopp 'd trunk it was , and huge ,</l>
       <l n="410">Still rough — like those which men in treeless plains</l>
       <l n="411">To build them boats fish from the flooded rivers ,</l>
       <l n="412">Hyphasis or Hydaspes , when , high up</l>
       <l n="413">By their dark springs , the wind in winter-time</l>
       <l n="414">Hath made in Himalayan forests wrack ,</l>
       <l n="415">And strewn the channels with torn boughs — so huge</l>
       <l n="416">The club which Rustum lifted now , and struck</l>
       <l n="417">One stroke ; but again Sohrab sprang aside ,</l>
       <l n="418">Lithe as the glancing snake , and the club came</l>
       <l n="419">Thundering to earth , and leapt from Rustum 's hand .</l>
       <l n="420">And Rustum follow 'd his own blow , and fell</l>
       <l n="421">To his knees , and with his fingers clutch 'd the sand ;</l>
       <l n="422">And now might Sohrab have unsheathed his sword ,</l>
       <l n="423">And pierced the mighty Rustum while he lay</l>
       <l n="424">Dizzy , and on his knees , and choked with sand ;</l>
       <l n="425">But he look 'd on , and smiled , nor bared his sword ,</l>
       <l n="426">But courteously drew back , and spoke , and said :—</l>
       <l n="427">“ Thou strik'st too hard ! that club of thine will float</l>
       <l n="428">Upon the summer-floods , and not my bones .</l>
       <l n="429">But rise , and be not wroth ! not wroth am I ;</l>
       <l n="430">No , when I see thee , wrath forsakes my soul .</l>
       <l n="431">Thou say'st , thou art not Rustum ; be it so !</l>
       <l n="432">Who art thou then , that canst so touch my soul ?</l>
       <l n="433">Boy as I am , I have seen battles too —</l>
       <l n="434">Have waded foremost in their bloody waves ,</l>
       <l n="435">And heard their hollow roar of dying men ;</l>
       <l n="436">But never was my heart thus touch 'd before .</l>
       <l n="437">Are they from Heaven , these softenings of the heart ?</l>
       <l n="438">O thou old warrior , let us yield to Heaven !</l>
       <l n="439">Come , plant we here in earth our angry spears ,</l>
       <l n="440">And make a truce , and sit upon this sand ,</l>
       <l n="441">And pledge each other in red wine , like friends ,</l>
       <l n="442">And thou shalt talk to me of Rustum 's deeds .</l>
       <l n="443">There are enough foes in the Persian host ,</l>
       <l n="444">Whom I may meet , and strike , and feel no pang ;</l>
       <l n="445">Champions enough Afrasiab has , whom thou</l>
       <l n="446">Mayst fight ; fight them , when they confront thy spear !</l>
       <l n="447">But oh , let there be peace ‘ twixt thee and me ! ”</l>
       <l n="448">He ceased , but while he spake , Rustum had risen ,</l>
       <l n="449">And stood erect , trembling with rage ; his club</l>
       <l n="450">He left to lie , but had regain 'd his spear ,</l>
       <l n="451">Whose fiery point now in his mail 'd right-hand</l>
       <l n="452">Blazed bright and baleful , like that autumn-star ,</l>
       <l n="453">The baleful sign of fevers ; dust had soil 'd</l>
       <l n="454">His stately crest , and dimm 'd his glittering arms .</l>
       <l n="455">His breast heaved , his lips foam 'd , and twice his voice</l>
       <l n="456">Was choked with rage ; at last these words broke way :—</l>
       <l n="457">“ Girl ! nimble with thy feet , not with thy hands !</l>
       <l n="458">Curl 'd minion , dancer , coiner of sweet words !</l>
       <l n="459">Fight , let me hear thy hateful voice no more !</l>
       <l n="460">Thou art not in Afrasiab 's gardens now</l>
       <l n="461">With Tartar girls , with whom thou art wont to dance ;</l>
       <l n="462">But on the Oxus-sands , and in the dance</l>
       <l n="463">Of battle , and with me , who make no play</l>
       <l n="464">Of war ; I fight it out , and hand to hand .</l>
       <l n="465">Speak not to me of truce , and pledge , and wine !</l>
       <l n="466">Remember all thy valour ; try thy feints</l>
       <l n="467">And cunning ! all the pity I had is gone ;</l>
       <l n="468">Because thou hast shamed me before both the hosts</l>
       <l n="469">With thy light skipping tricks , and thy girl 's wiles . ”</l>
       <l n="470">He spoke , and Sohrab kindled at his taunts ,</l>
       <l n="471">And he too drew his sword ; at once they rush 'd</l>
       <l n="472">Together , as two eagles on one prey</l>
       <l n="473">Come rushing down together from the clouds ,</l>
       <l n="474">One from the east , one from the west ; their shields</l>
       <l n="475">Dash 'd with a clang together , and a din</l>
       <l n="476">Rose , such as that the sinewy woodcutters</l>
       <l n="477">Make often in the forest 's heart at morn ,</l>
       <l n="478">Of hewing axes , crashing trees — such blows</l>
       <l n="479">Rustum and Sohrab on each other hail 'd .</l>
       <l n="480">And you would say that sun and stars took part</l>
       <l n="481">In that unnatural conflict ; for a cloud</l>
       <l n="482">Grew suddenly in Heaven , and dark 'd the sun</l>
       <l n="483">Over the fighters ’ heads ; and a wind rose</l>
       <l n="484">Under their feet , and moaning swept the plain ,</l>
       <l n="485">And in a sandy whirlwind wrapp 'd the pair .</l>
       <l n="486">In gloom they twain were wrapp 'd , and they alone ;</l>
       <l n="487">For both the on-looking hosts on either hand</l>
       <l n="488">Stood in broad daylight , and the sky was pure ,</l>
       <l n="489">And the sun sparkled on the Oxus stream .</l>
       <l n="490">But in the gloom they fought , with bloodshot eyes</l>
       <l n="491">And labouring breath ; first Rustum struck the shield</l>
       <l n="492">Which Sohrab held stiff out ; the steel-spiked spear</l>
       <l n="493">Rent the tough plates , but fail 'd to reach the skin ,</l>
       <l n="494">And Rustum pluck 'd it back with angry groan .</l>
       <l n="495">Then Sohrab with his sword smote Rustum 's helm ,</l>
       <l n="496">Nor clove its steel quite through ; but all the crest</l>
       <l n="497">He shore away , and that proud horsehair plume ,</l>
       <l n="498">Never till now defiled , sank to the dust ;</l>
       <l n="499">And Rustum bow 'd his head ; but then the gloom</l>
       <l n="500">Grew blacker , thunder rumbled in the air ,</l>
       <l n="501">And lightnings rent the cloud ; and Ruksh , the horse ,</l>
       <l n="502">Who stood at hand , utter 'd a dreadful cry ;—</l>
       <l n="503">No horse 's cry was that , most like the roar</l>
       <l n="504">Of some pain 'd desert-lion , who all day</l>
       <l n="505">Hath trail 'd the hunter 's javelin in his side ,</l>
       <l n="506">And comes at night to die upon the sand .</l>
       <l n="507">The two hosts heard that cry , and quaked for fear ,</l>
       <l n="508">And Oxus curdled as it cross 'd his stream .</l>
       <l n="509">But Sohrab heard , and quail 'd not , but rush 'd on ,</l>
       <l n="510">And struck again ; and again Rustum bow 'd</l>
       <l n="511">His head ; but this time all the blade , like glass ,</l>
       <l n="512">Sprang in a thousand shivers on the helm ,</l>
       <l n="513">And in the hand the hilt remain 'd alone .</l>
       <l n="514">Then Rustum raised his head ; his dreadful eyes</l>
       <l n="515">Glared , and he shook on high his menacing spear ,</l>
       <l n="516">And shouted : Rustum !— Sohrab heard that shout ,</l>
       <l n="517">And shrank amazed ; back he recoil 'd one step ,</l>
       <l n="518">And scann 'd with blinking eyes the advancing form ;</l>
       <l n="519">And then he stood bewilder 'd ; and he dropp 'd</l>
       <l n="520">His covering shield , and the spear pierced his side .</l>
       <l n="521">He reel 'd , and staggering back , sank to the ground ;</l>
       <l n="522">And then the gloom dispersed , and the wind fell ,</l>
       <l n="523">And the bright sun broke forth , and melted all</l>
       <l n="524">The cloud ; and the two armies saw the pair —</l>
       <l n="525">Saw Rustum standing , safe upon his feet ,</l>
       <l n="526">And Sohrab , wounded , on the bloody sand .</l>
       <l n="527">Then , with a bitter smile , Rustum began :—</l>
       <l n="528">“ Sohrab , thou thoughtest in thy mind to kill</l>
       <l n="529">A Persian lord this day , and strip his corpse ,</l>
       <l n="530">And bear thy trophies to Afrasiab 's tent .</l>
       <l n="531">Or else that the great Rustum would come down</l>
       <l n="532">Himself to fight , and that thy wiles would move</l>
       <l n="533">His heart to take a gift , and let thee go .</l>
       <l n="534">And then that all the Tartar host would praise</l>
       <l n="535">Thy courage or thy craft , and spread thy fame ,</l>
       <l n="536">To glad thy father in his weak old age .</l>
       <l n="537">Fool , thou art slain , and by an unknown man !</l>
       <l n="538">Dearer to the red jackals shalt thou be</l>
       <l n="539">Than to thy friends , and to thy father old . ”</l>
       <l n="540">And , with a fearless mien , Sohrab replied :—</l>
       <l n="541">“ Unknown thou art ; yet thy fierce vaunt is vain .</l>
       <l n="542">Thou dost not slay me , proud and boastful man !</l>
       <l n="543">No ! Rustum slays me , and this filial heart .</l>
       <l n="544">For were I match 'd with ten such men as thee ,</l>
       <l n="545">And I were that which till to-day I was ,</l>
       <l n="546">They should be lying here , I standing there .</l>
       <l n="547">But that belovéd name unnerved my arm —</l>
       <l n="548">That name , and something , I confess , in thee ,</l>
       <l n="549">Which troubles all my heart , and made my shield</l>
       <l n="550">Fall ; and thy spear transfix 'd an unarm 'd foe .</l>
       <l n="551">And now thou boastest , and insult'st my fate .</l>
       <l n="552">But hear thou this , fierce man , tremble to hear :</l>
       <l n="553">The mighty Rustum shall avenge my death !</l>
       <l n="554">My father , whom I seek through all the world ,</l>
       <l n="555">He shall avenge my death , and punish thee ! ”</l>
       <l n="556">As when some hunter in the spring hath found</l>
       <l n="557">A breeding eagle sitting on her nest ,</l>
       <l n="558">Upon the craggy isle of a hill-lake ,</l>
       <l n="559">And pierced her with an arrow as she rose ,</l>
       <l n="560">And follow 'd her to find her where she fell</l>
       <l n="561">Far off ;— anon her mate comes winging back</l>
       <l n="562">From hunting , and a great way off descries</l>
       <l n="563">His huddling young left sole ; at that , he checks</l>
       <l n="564">His pinion , and with short uneasy sweeps</l>
       <l n="565">Circles above his eyry , with loud screams</l>
       <l n="566">Chiding his mate back to her nest ; but she</l>
       <l n="567">Lies dying , with the arrow in her side ,</l>
       <l n="568">In some far stony gorge out of his ken ,</l>
       <l n="569">A heap of fluttering feathers — never more</l>
       <l n="570">Shall the lake glass her , flying over it ;</l>
       <l n="571">Never the black and dripping precipices</l>
       <l n="572">Echo her stormy scream as she sails by —</l>
       <l n="573">As that poor bird flies home , nor knows his loss ,</l>
       <l n="574">So Rustum knew not his own loss , but stood</l>
       <l n="575">Over his dying son , and knew him not .</l>
       <l n="576">But , with a cold incredulous voice , he said :—</l>
       <l n="577">“ What prate is this of fathers and revenge ?</l>
       <l n="578">The mighty Rustum never had a son . ”</l>
       <l n="579">And , with a failing voice , Sohrab replied :—</l>
       <l n="580">“ Ah yes , he had ! and that lost son am I .</l>
       <l n="581">Surely the news will one day reach his ear ,</l>
       <l n="582">Reach Rustum , where he sits , and tarries long ,</l>
       <l n="583">Somewhere , I know not where , but far from here ;</l>
       <l n="584">And pierce him like a stab , and make him leap</l>
       <l n="585">To arms , and cry for vengeance upon thee .</l>
       <l n="586">Fierce man , bethink thee , for an only son !</l>
       <l n="587">What will that grief , what will that vengeance be ?</l>
       <l n="588">Oh , could I live , till I that grief had seen !</l>
       <l n="589">Yet him I pity not so much , but her ,</l>
       <l n="590">My mother , who in Ader-baijan dwells</l>
       <l n="591">With that old king , her father , who grows grey</l>
       <l n="592">With age , and rules over the valiant Koords .</l>
       <l n="593">Her most I pity , who no more will see</l>
       <l n="594">Sohrab returning from the Tartar camp ,</l>
       <l n="595">With spoils and honour , when the war is done .</l>
       <l n="596">But a dark rumour will be bruited up ,</l>
       <l n="597">From tribe to tribe , until it reach her ear ;</l>
       <l n="598">And then will that defenceless woman learn</l>
       <l n="599">That Sohrab will rejoice her sight no more ,</l>
       <l n="600">But that in battle with a nameless foe ,</l>
       <l n="601">By the far-distant Oxus , he is slain . ”</l>
       <l n="602">He spoke ; and as he ceased , he wept aloud ,</l>
       <l n="603">Thinking of her he left , and his own death .</l>
       <l n="604">He spoke ; but Rustum listen 'd , plunged in thought .</l>
       <l n="605">Nor did he yet believe it was his son</l>
       <l n="606">Who spoke , although he call 'd back names he knew ;</l>
       <l n="607">For he had had sure tidings that the babe ,</l>
       <l n="608">Which was in Ader-baijan born to him ,</l>
       <l n="609">Had been a puny girl , no boy at all —</l>
       <l n="610">So that sad mother sent him word , for fear</l>
       <l n="611">Rustum should seek the boy , to train in arms</l>
       <l n="612">And so he deem 'd that either Sohrab took ,</l>
       <l n="613">By a false boast , the style of Rustum 's son ;</l>
       <l n="614">Or that men gave it him , to swell his fame .</l>
       <l n="615">So deem 'd he ; yet he listen 'd , plunged in thought</l>
       <l n="616">And his soul set to grief , as the vast tide</l>
       <l n="617">Of the bright rocking Ocean sets to shore</l>
       <l n="618">At the full moon ; tears gather 'd in his eyes ;</l>
       <l n="619">For he remember 'd his own early youth ,</l>
       <l n="620">And all its bounding rapture ; as , at dawn ,</l>
       <l n="621">The shepherd from his mountain-lodge descries</l>
       <l n="622">A far , bright city , smitten by the sun ,</l>
       <l n="623">Through many rolling clouds — so Rustum saw</l>
       <l n="624">His youth ; saw Sohrab 's mother , in her bloom ;</l>
       <l n="625">And that old king , her father , who loved well</l>
       <l n="626">His wandering guest , and gave him his fair child</l>
       <l n="627">With joy ; and all the pleasant life they led ,</l>
       <l n="628">They three , in that long-distant summer-time —</l>
       <l n="629">The castle , and the dewy woods , and hunt</l>
       <l n="630">And hound , and morn on those delightful hills</l>
       <l n="631">In Ader-baijan . And he saw that Youth ,</l>
       <l n="632">Of age and looks to be his own dear son ,</l>
       <l n="633">Piteous and lovely , lying on the sand ,</l>
       <l n="634">Like some rich hyacinth which by the scythe</l>
       <l n="635">Of an unskilful gardener has been cut ,</l>
       <l n="636">Mowing the garden grass-plots near its bed ,</l>
       <l n="637">And lies , a fragrant tower of purple bloom ,</l>
       <l n="638">On the mown , dying grass — so Sohrab lay ,</l>
       <l n="639">Lovely in death , upon the common sand .</l>
       <l n="640">And Rustum gazed on him with grief , and said :—</l>
       <l n="641">“ O Sohrab , thou indeed art such a son</l>
       <l n="642">Whom Rustum , wert thou his , might well have loved .</l>
       <l n="643">Yet here thou errest , Sohrab , or else men</l>
       <l n="644">Have told thee false — thou art not Rustum 's son .</l>
       <l n="645">For Rustum had no son ; one child he had —</l>
       <l n="646">But one — a girl ; who with her mother now</l>
       <l n="647">Plies some light female task , nor dreams of us —</l>
       <l n="648">Of us she dreams not , nor of wounds , nor war . ”</l>
       <l n="649">But Sohrab answer 'd him in wrath ; for now</l>
       <l n="650">The anguish of the deep-fix 'd spear grew fierce ,</l>
       <l n="651">And he desired to draw forth the steel ,</l>
       <l n="652">And let the blood flow free , and so to die —</l>
       <l n="653">But first he would convince his stubborn foe ;</l>
       <l n="654">And , rising sternly on one arm , he said :—</l>
       <l n="655">“ Man , who art thou who dost deny my words ?</l>
       <l n="656">Truth sits upon the lips of dying men ,</l>
       <l n="657">And falsehood , while I lived , was far from mine .</l>
       <l n="658">I tell thee , prick 'd upon this arm I bear</l>
       <l n="659">That seal which Rustum to my mother gave ,</l>
       <l n="660">That she might prick it on the babe she bore . ”</l>
       <l n="661">He spoke ; and all the blood left Rustum 's cheeks ,</l>
       <l n="662">And his knees totter 'd , and he smote his hand</l>
       <l n="663">Against his breast , his heavy mailed hand ,</l>
       <l n="664">That the hard iron corslet clank 'd aloud ;</l>
       <l n="665">And to his heart he press 'd the other hand ,</l>
       <l n="666">And in a hollow voice he spake , and said :—</l>
       <l n="667">“ Sohrab , that were a proof which could not lie !</l>
       <l n="668">If thou show this , then art thou Rustum 's son . ”</l>
       <l n="669">Then , with weak hasty fingers , Sohrab loosed</l>
       <l n="670">His belt , and near the shoulder bared his arm ,</l>
       <l n="671">And show 'd a sign in faint vermilion points</l>
       <l n="672">Prick 'd ; as a cunning workman , in Pekin ,</l>
       <l n="673">Pricks with vermilion some clear porcelain vase ,</l>
       <l n="674">An emperor 's gift — at early morn he paints ,</l>
       <l n="675">And all day long , and , when night comes , the lamp</l>
       <l n="676">Lights up his studious forehead and thin hands —</l>
       <l n="677">So delicately prick 'd the sign appear 'd</l>
       <l n="678">On Sohrab 's arm , the sign of Rustum 's seal .</l>
       <l n="679">It was that griffin , which of old rear 'd Zal ,</l>
       <l n="680">Rustum 's great father , whom they left to die ,</l>
       <l n="681">A helpless babe , among the mountain-rocks ;</l>
       <l n="682">Him that kind creature found , and rear 'd , and loved —</l>
       <l n="683">Then Rustum took it for his glorious sign .</l>
       <l n="684">And Sohrab bared that image on his arm ,</l>
       <l n="685">And himself scann 'd it long with mournful eyes ,</l>
       <l n="686">And then he touch 'd it with his hand and said :—</l>
       <l n="687">“ How say'st thou ? Is that sign the proper sign</l>
       <l n="688">Of Rustum 's son , or of some other man 's ? ”</l>
       <l n="689">He spoke ; but Rustum gazed , and gazed , and stood</l>
       <l n="690">Speechless ; and then he utter 'd one sharp cry :</l>
       <l n="691">O boy — thy father !— and his voice choked there .</l>
       <l n="692">And then a dark cloud pass 'd before his eyes ,</l>
       <l n="693">And his head swam , and he sank down to earth .</l>
       <l n="694">But Sohrab crawl 'd to where he lay , and cast</l>
       <l n="695">His arms about his neck , and kiss 'd his lips ,</l>
       <l n="696">And with fond faltering fingers stroked his cheeks ,</l>
       <l n="697">Trying to call him back to life ; and life</l>
       <l n="698">Came back to Rustum , and he oped his eyes ,</l>
       <l n="699">And they stood wide with horror ; and he seized</l>
       <l n="700">In both his hands the dust which lay around ,</l>
       <l n="701">And threw it on his head , and smirch 'd his hair ,—</l>
       <l n="702">His hair , and face , and beard , and glittering arms ;</l>
       <l n="703">And strong convulsive groanings shook his breast ,</l>
       <l n="704">And his sobs choked him ; and he clutch 'd his sword ,</l>
       <l n="705">To draw it , and for ever let life out .</l>
       <l n="706">But Sohrab saw his thought , and held his hands ,</l>
       <l n="707">And with a soothing voice he spake , and said :—</l>
       <l n="708">“ Father , forbear ! for I but meet to-day</l>
       <l n="709">The doom which at my birth was written down</l>
       <l n="710">In Heaven , and thou art Heaven 's unconscious hand .</l>
       <l n="711">Surely my heart cried out that it was thou ,</l>
       <l n="712">When first I saw thee ; and thy heart spoke too ,</l>
       <l n="713">I know it ! but fate trod those promptings down</l>
       <l n="714">Under its iron heel ; fate , fate engaged</l>
       <l n="715">The strife , and hurl 'd me on my father 's spear .</l>
       <l n="716">But let us speak no more of this ! I find</l>
       <l n="717">My father ; let me feel that I have found !</l>
       <l n="718">Come , sit beside me on this sand , and take</l>
       <l n="719">My head betwixt thy hands , and kiss my cheeks ,</l>
       <l n="720">And wash them with thy tears , and say : My son !</l>
       <l n="721">Quick ! quick ! for number 'd are my sands of life ,</l>
       <l n="722">And swift ; for like the lightning to this field</l>
       <l n="723">I came , and like the wind I go away —</l>
       <l n="724">Sudden , and swift , and like a passing wind .</l>
       <l n="725">But it was writ in Heaven that this should be . ”</l>
       <l n="726">So said he , and his voice released the heart</l>
       <l n="727">Of Rustum , and his tears broke forth ; he cast</l>
       <l n="728">His arms round his son 's neck , and wept aloud ,</l>
       <l n="729">And kiss 'd him . And awe fell on both the hosts ,</l>
       <l n="730">When they saw Rustum 's grief ; and Ruksh , the horse ,</l>
       <l n="731">With his head bowing to the ground and mane</l>
       <l n="732">Sweeping the dust , came near , and in mute woe</l>
       <l n="733">First to the one then to the other moved</l>
       <l n="734">His head , as if inquiring what their grief</l>
       <l n="735">Might mean ; and from his dark , compassionate eyes ,</l>
       <l n="736">The big warm tears roll 'd down , and caked the sand .</l>
       <l n="737">But Rustum chid him with stern voice , and said :—</l>
       <l n="738">“ Ruksh , now thou grievest ; but , O Ruksh , thy feet</l>
       <l n="739">Should first have rotted on their nimble joints ,</l>
       <l n="740">Or ere they brought thy master to this field ! ”</l>
       <l n="741">But Sohrab look 'd upon the horse and said ;—</l>
       <l n="742">“ Is this , then , Ruksh ? How often , in past days ,</l>
       <l n="743">My mother told me of thee , thou brave steed ,</l>
       <l n="744">My terrible father 's terrible horse ! and said ,</l>
       <l n="745">That I should one day find thy lord and thee .</l>
       <l n="746">Come , let me lay my hand upon thy mane !</l>
       <l n="747">O Ruksh , thou art more fortunate than I ;</l>
       <l n="748">For thou hast gone where I shall never go ,</l>
       <l n="749">And snuff 'd the breezes of my father 's home .</l>
       <l n="750">And thou hast trod the sands of Seistan ,</l>
       <l n="751">And seen the River of Helmund , and the Lake</l>
       <l n="752">Of Zirrah ; and the aged Zal himself</l>
       <l n="753">Has often stroked thy neck , and given thee food ,</l>
       <l n="754">Corn in a golden platter soak 'd with wine ,</l>
       <l n="755">And said ; O Ruksh ! bear Rustum well !— but I</l>
       <l n="756">Have never known my grandsire 's furrow 'd face ,</l>
       <l n="757">Nor seen his lofty house in Seistan ,</l>
       <l n="758">Nor slaked my thirst at the clear Helmund stream ;</l>
       <l n="759">But lodged among my father 's foes , and seen</l>
       <l n="760">Afrasiab 's cities only , Samarcand ,</l>
       <l n="761">Bokhara , and lone Khiva in the waste ,</l>
       <l n="762">And the black Toorkmun tents ; and only drunk</l>
       <l n="763">The desert rivers , Moorghab and Tejend ,</l>
       <l n="764">Kohik , and where the Kalmuks feed their sheep ,</l>
       <l n="765">The northern Sir ; and this great Oxus stream ,</l>
       <l n="766">The yellow Oxus , by whose brink I die . ”</l>
       <l n="767">Then , with a heavy groan , Rustum bewail 'd :—</l>
       <l n="768">“ Oh , that its waves were flowing over me !</l>
       <l n="769">Oh , that I saw its grains of yellow silt</l>
       <l n="770">Roll tumbling in the current o'er my head ! ”</l>
       <l n="771">But , with a grave mild voice , Sohrab replied :—</l>
       <l n="772">“ Desire not that , my father ! thou must live .</l>
       <l n="773">For some are born to do great deeds , and live ,</l>
       <l n="774">As some are born to be obscured , and die .</l>
       <l n="775">Do thou the deeds I die too young to do ,</l>
       <l n="776">And reap a second glory in thine age ;</l>
       <l n="777">Thou art my father , and thy gain is mine .</l>
       <l n="778">But come ! thou seest this great host of men</l>
       <l n="779">Which follow me ; I pray thee , slay not these !</l>
       <l n="780">Let me entreat for them ; what have they done ?</l>
       <l n="781">They follow 'd me , my hope , my fame , my star .</l>
       <l n="782">Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace .</l>
       <l n="783">But me thou must bear hence , not send with them ,</l>
       <l n="784">But carry me with thee to Seistan ,</l>
       <l n="785">And place me on a bed , and mourn for me ,</l>
       <l n="786">Thou , and the snow-hair 'd Zal , and all thy friends .</l>
       <l n="787">And thou must lay me in that lovely earth ,</l>
       <l n="788">And heap a stately mound above my bones ,</l>
       <l n="789">And plant a far-seen pillar over all .</l>
       <l n="790">That so the passing horseman on the waste</l>
       <l n="791">May see my tomb a great way off , and cry :</l>
       <l n="792">Sohrab , the mighty Rustum 's son , lies there ,</l>
       <l n="793">Whom his great father did in ignorance kill !</l>
       <l n="794">And I be not forgotten in my grave . ”</l>
       <l n="795">And , with a mournful voice , Rustum replied :—</l>
       <l n="796">“ Fear not ! as thou hast said , Sohrab , my son ,</l>
       <l n="797">So shall it be ; for I will burn my tents ,</l>
       <l n="798">And quit the host , and bear thee hence with me ,</l>
       <l n="799">And carry thee away to Seistan ,</l>
       <l n="800">And place thee on a bed , and mourn for thee ,</l>
       <l n="801">With the snow-headed Zal , and all my friends .</l>
       <l n="802">And I will lay thee in that lovely earth ,</l>
       <l n="803">And heap a stately mound above thy bones ,</l>
       <l n="804">And plant a far-seen pillar over all ,</l>
       <l n="805">And men shall not forget thee in thy grave .</l>
       <l n="806">And I will spare thy host ; yea , let them go !</l>
       <l n="807">Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace !</l>
       <l n="808">What should I do with slaying any more ?</l>
       <l n="809">For would that all that I have ever slain</l>
       <l n="810">Might be once more alive ; my bitterest foes ,</l>
       <l n="811">And they who were call 'd champions in their time ,</l>
       <l n="812">And through whose death I won that fame I have —</l>
       <l n="813">And I were nothing but a common man ,</l>
       <l n="814">A poor , mean soldier , and without renown ,</l>
       <l n="815">So thou mightest live too , my son , my son !</l>
       <l n="816">Or rather would that I , even I myself ,</l>
       <l n="817">Might now be lying on this bloody sand ,</l>
       <l n="818">Near death , and by an ignorant stroke of thine ,</l>
       <l n="819">Not thou of mine ! and I might die , not thou ;</l>
       <l n="820">And I , not thou , be borne to Seistan ;</l>
       <l n="821">And Zal might weep above my grave , not thine ;</l>
       <l n="822">And say : O son , I weep thee not too sore ,</l>
       <l n="823">For willingly , I know , thou met'st thine end !</l>
       <l n="824">But now in blood and battles was my youth ,</l>
       <l n="825">And full of blood and battles is my age ,</l>
       <l n="826">And I shall never end this life of blood . ”</l>
       <l n="827">Then , at the point of death , Sohrab replied :—</l>
       <l n="828">“ A life of blood indeed , thou dreadful man !</l>
       <l n="829">But thou shalt yet have peace ; only not now ,</l>
       <l n="830">Not yet ! but thou shalt have it on that day ,</l>
       <l n="831">When thou shalt sail in a high-masted ship ,</l>
       <l n="832">Thou and the other peers of Kai Khosroo ,</l>
       <l n="833">Returning home over the salt blue sea ,</l>
       <l n="834">From laying thy dear master in his grave . ”</l>
       <l n="835">And Rustum gazed in Sohrab 's face , and said :—</l>
       <l n="836">“ Soon be that day , my son , and deep that sea !</l>
       <l n="837">Till then , if fate so wills , let me endure . ”</l>
       <l n="838">He spoke ; and Sohrab smiled on him , and took</l>
       <l n="839">The spear , and drew it from his side , and eased</l>
       <l n="840">His wound 's imperious anguish ; but the blood</l>
       <l n="841">Came welling from the open gash , and life</l>
       <l n="842">Flow 'd with the stream ;— all down his cold white side</l>
       <l n="843">The crimson torrent ran , dim now and soil 'd ,</l>
       <l n="844">Like the soil 'd tissue of white violets</l>
       <l n="845">Left , freshly gather 'd , on their native bank ,</l>
       <l n="846">By children whom their nurses call with haste</l>
       <l n="847">Indoors from the sun 's eye ; his head droop 'd low ,</l>
       <l n="848">His limbs grew slack ; motionless , white , he lay —</l>
       <l n="849">White , with eyes closed ; only when heavy gasps ,</l>
       <l n="850">Deep heavy gasps quivering through all his frame ,</l>
       <l n="851">Convulsed him back to life , he open 'd them ,</l>
       <l n="852">And fix 'd them feebly on his father 's face ;</l>
       <l n="853">Till now all strength was ebb 'd , and from his limbs</l>
       <l n="854">Unwillingly the spirit fled away ,</l>
       <l n="855">Regretting the warm mansion which it left ,</l>
       <l n="856">And youth , and bloom , and this delightful world .</l>
       <l n="857">So , on the bloody sand , Sohrab lay dead ;</l>
       <l n="858">And the great Rustum drew his horseman 's cloak</l>
       <l n="859">Down o'er his face , and sate by his dead son .</l>
       <l n="860">As those black granite pillars , once high-rear 'd</l>
       <l n="861">By Jemshid in Persepolis , to bear</l>
       <l n="862">His house , now ‘ mid their broken flights of steps</l>
       <l n="863">Lie prone , enormous , down the mountain side —</l>
       <l n="864">So in the sand lay Rustum by his son .</l>
       <l n="865">And night came down over the solemn waste ,</l>
       <l n="866">And the two gazing hosts , and that sole pair ,</l>
       <l n="867">And darken 'd all ; and a cold fog , with night ,</l>
       <l n="868">Crept from the Oxus . Soon a hum arose ,</l>
       <l n="869">As of a great assembly loosed , and fires</l>
       <l n="870">Began to twinkle through the fog ; for now</l>
       <l n="871">Both armies moved to camp , and took their meal ;</l>
       <l n="872">The Persians took it on the open sands</l>
       <l n="873">Southward , the Tartars by the river marge ;</l>
       <l n="874">And Rustum and his son were left alone .</l>
       <l n="875">But the majestic river floated on ,</l>
       <l n="876">Out of the mist and hum of that low land ,</l>
       <l n="877">Into the frosty starlight , and there moved ,</l>
       <l n="878">Rejoicing , through the hush 'd Chorasmian waste ,</l>
       <l n="879">Under the solitary moon ;— he flow 'd</l>
       <l n="880">Right for the polar star , past Orgunjè ,</l>
       <l n="881">Brimming , and bright , and large ; then sands begin</l>
       <l n="882">To hem his watery march , and dam his streams ,</l>
       <l n="883">And split his currents ; that for many a league</l>
       <l n="884">The shorn and parcell 'd Oxus strains along</l>
       <l n="885">Through beds of sand and matted rushy isles —</l>
       <l n="886">Oxus , forgetting the bright speed he had</l>
       <l n="887">In his high mountain-cradle in Pamere ,</l>
       <l n="888">A foil 'd circuitous wanderer — till at last</l>
       <l n="889">The long'dhYpppHeNfor dash of waves is heard , and wide</l>
       <l n="890">His luminous home of waters opens , bright</l>
       <l n="891">And tranquil , from whose floor the new-bathed stars</l>
       <l n="892">Emerge , and shine upon the Aral Sea .</l>

      <lg type="part" n="1">
       <head>I . SENDING</head>
        <l n="1">So on the floor lay Balder dead ; and round</l>
        <l n="2">Lay thickly strewn swords , axes , darts , and spears ,</l>
        <l n="3">Which all the Gods in sport had idly thrown</l>
        <l n="4">At Balder , whom no weapon pierced or clove ;</l>
        <l n="5">But in his breast stood fixt the fatal bough</l>
        <l n="6">Of mistletoe , which Lok the Accuser gave</l>
        <l n="7">To Hoder , and unwitting Hoder threw —</l>
        <l n="8">‘ Gainst that alone had Balder 's life no charm .</l>
        <l n="9">And all the Gods and all the Heroes came ,</l>
        <l n="10">And stood round Balder on the bloody floor ,</l>
        <l n="11">Weeping and wailing ; and Valhalla rang</l>
        <l n="12">Up to its golden roof with sobs and cries ;</l>
        <l n="13">And on the tables stood the untasted meats ,</l>
        <l n="14">And in the horns and gold-rimm 'd skulls the wine .</l>
        <l n="15">And now would night have fall'n , and found them yet</l>
        <l n="16">Wailing ; but otherwise was Odin 's will .</l>
        <l n="17">And thus the father of the ages spake :—</l>
        <l n="18">“ Enough of tears , ye Gods , enough of wail !</l>
        <l n="19">Not to lament in was Valhalla made .</l>
        <l n="20">If any here might weep for Balder 's death ,</l>
        <l n="21">I most might weep , his father ; such a son</l>
        <l n="22">I lose to-day , so bright , so loved a God .</l>
        <l n="23">But he has met that doom , which long ago</l>
        <l n="24">The Nornies , when his mother bare him , spun ,</l>
        <l n="25">And fate set seal , that so his end must be .</l>
        <l n="26">Balder has met his death , and ye survive —</l>
        <l n="27">Weep him an hour , but what can grief avail ?</l>
        <l n="28">For ye yourselves , ye Gods , shall meet your doom ,</l>
        <l n="29">All ye who hear me , and inhabit Heaven ,</l>
        <l n="30">And I too , Odin too , the Lord of all .</l>
        <l n="31">But ours we shall not meet , when that day comes ,</l>
        <l n="32">With women 's tears and weak complaining cries —</l>
        <l n="33">Why should we meet another 's portion so ?</l>
        <l n="34">Rather it fits you , having wept your hour ,</l>
        <l n="35">With cold dry eyes , and hearts composed and stern ,</l>
        <l n="36">To live , as erst , your daily life in Heaven .</l>
        <l n="37">By me shall vengeance on the murderer Lok ,</l>
        <l n="38">The foe , the accuser , whom , though Gods , we hate ,</l>
        <l n="39">Be strictly cared for , in the appointed day .</l>
        <l n="40">Meanwhile , to-morrow , when the morning dawns ,</l>
        <l n="41">Bring wood to the seashore to Balder 's ship ,</l>
        <l n="42">And on the deck build high a funeral-pile ,</l>
        <l n="43">And on the top lay Balder 's corpse , and put</l>
        <l n="44">Fire to the wood , and send him out to sea</l>
        <l n="45">To burn ; for that is what the dead desire . ”</l>
        <l n="46">So spake the King of Gods , and straightway rose ,</l>
        <l n="47">And mounted his horse Sleipner , whom he rode ;</l>
        <l n="48">And from the hall of Heaven he rode away</l>
        <l n="49">To Lidskialf , and sate upon his throne ,</l>
        <l n="50">The mount , from whence his eye surveys the world .</l>
        <l n="51">And far from Heaven he turn 'd his shining orbs</l>
        <l n="52">To look on Midgard , and the earth , and men .</l>
        <l n="53">And on the conjuring Lapps he bent his gaze</l>
        <l n="54">Whom antler 'd reindeer pull over the snow ;</l>
        <l n="55">And on the Finns , the gentlest of mankind ,</l>
        <l n="56">Fair men , who live in holes under the ground ;</l>
        <l n="57">Nor did he look once more to Ida 's plain ,</l>
        <l n="58">Nor tow'rd Valhalla , and the sorrowing Gods ;</l>
        <l n="59">For well he knew the Gods would heed his word ,</l>
        <l n="60">And cease to mourn , and think of Balder 's pyre .</l>
        <l n="61">But in Valhalla all the Gods went back</l>
        <l n="62">From around Balder , all the Heroes went ;</l>
        <l n="63">And left his body stretch 'd upon the floor .</l>
        <l n="64">And on their golden chairs they sate again ,</l>
        <l n="65">Beside the tables , in the hall of Heaven ;</l>
        <l n="66">And before each the cooks who served them placed</l>
        <l n="67">New messes of the boar Serimner 's flesh ,</l>
        <l n="68">And the Valkyries crown 'd their horns with mead .</l>
        <l n="69">So they , with pent-up hearts and tearless eyes ,</l>
        <l n="70">Wailing no more , in silence ate and drank ,</l>
        <l n="71">While twilight fell , and sacred night came on .</l>
        <l n="72">But the blind Hoder left the feasting Gods</l>
        <l n="73">In Odin 's hall , and went through Asgard streets ,</l>
        <l n="74">And past the haven where the Gods have moor 'd</l>
        <l n="75">Their ships , and through the gate , beyond the wall ;</l>
        <l n="76">Though sightless , yet his own mind led the God .</l>
        <l n="77">Down to the margin of the roaring sea</l>
        <l n="78">He came , and sadly went along the sand ,</l>
        <l n="79">Between the waves and black o'erhanging cliffs</l>
        <l n="80">Where in and out the screaming seafowl fly ;</l>
        <l n="81">Until he came to where a gully breaks</l>
        <l n="82">Through the cliff-wall , and a fresh stream runs down</l>
        <l n="83">From the high moors behind , and meets the sea .</l>
        <l n="84">There , in the glen , Fensaler stands , the house</l>
        <l n="85">Of Frea , honour 'd mother of the Gods ,</l>
        <l n="86">And shows its lighted windows to the main .</l>
        <l n="87">There he went up , and pass 'd the open doors ;</l>
        <l n="88">And in the hall he found those women old ,</l>
        <l n="89">The prophetesses , who by rite eterne</l>
        <l n="90">On Frea 's hearth feed high the sacred fire</l>
        <l n="91">Both night and day ; and by the inner wall</l>
        <l n="92">Upon her golden chair the Mother sate ,</l>
        <l n="93">With folded hands , revolving things to come .</l>
        <l n="94">To her drew Hoder near , and spake , and said :—</l>
        <l n="95">“ Mother , a child of bale thou bar'st in me !</l>
        <l n="96">For , first , thou barest me with blinded eyes ,</l>
        <l n="97">Sightless and helpless , wandering weak in Heaven ;</l>
        <l n="98">And , after that , of ignorant witless mind</l>
        <l n="99">Thou barest me , and unforeseeing soul ;</l>
        <l n="100">That I alone must take the branch from Lok ,</l>
        <l n="101">The foe , the accuser , whom , though Gods , we hate ,</l>
        <l n="102">And cast it at the dear-loved Balder 's breast</l>
        <l n="103">At whom the Gods in sport their weapons threw —</l>
        <l n="104">‘ Gainst that alone had Balder 's life no charm .</l>
        <l n="105">Now therefore what to attempt , or whither fly ,</l>
        <l n="106">For who will bear my hateful sight in Heaven ?</l>
        <l n="107">Can I , O mother , bring them Balder back ?</l>
        <l n="108">Or — for thou know'st the fates , and things allow 'd —</l>
        <l n="109">Can I with Hela 's power a compact strike ,</l>
        <l n="110">And make exchange , and give my life for his ? ”</l>
        <l n="111">He spoke : the mother of the Gods replied :—</l>
        <l n="112">“ Hoder , ill-fated , child of bale , my son ,</l>
        <l n="113">Sightless in soul and eye , what words are these ?</l>
        <l n="114">That one , long portion 'd with his doom of death ,</l>
        <l n="115">Should change his lot , and fill another 's life ,</l>
        <l n="116">And Hela yield to this , and let him go !</l>
        <l n="117">On Balder Death hath laid her hand , not thee ;</l>
        <l n="118">Nor doth she count this life a price for that .</l>
        <l n="119">For many Gods in Heaven , not thou alone ,</l>
        <l n="120">Would freely die to purchase Balder back ,</l>
        <l n="121">And wend themselves to Hela 's gloomy realm .</l>
        <l n="122">For not so gladsome is that life in Heaven</l>
        <l n="123">Which Gods and heroes lead , in feast and fray ,</l>
        <l n="124">Waiting the darkness of the final times ,</l>
        <l n="125">That one should grudge its loss for Balder 's sake ,</l>
        <l n="126">Balder their joy , so bright , so loved a God .</l>
        <l n="127">But fate withstands , and laws forbid this way .</l>
        <l n="128">Yet in my secret mind one way I know ,</l>
        <l n="129">Nor do I judge if it shall win or fail ;</l>
        <l n="130">But much must still be tried , which shall but fail . ”</l>
        <l n="131">And the blind Hoder answer 'd her , and said :—</l>
        <l n="132">“ What way is this , O mother , that thou show'st ?</l>
        <l n="133">Is it a matter which a God might try ? ”</l>
        <l n="134">And straight the mother of the Gods replied :—</l>
        <l n="135">“ There is a road which leads to Hela 's realm ,</l>
        <l n="136">Untrodden , lonely , far from light and Heaven .</l>
        <l n="137">Who goes that way must take no other horse</l>
        <l n="138">To ride , but Sleipner , Odin 's horse , alone .</l>
        <l n="139">Nor must he choose that common path of Gods</l>
        <l n="140">Which every day they come and go in Heaven ,</l>
        <l n="141">O'er the bridge Bifrost , where is Heimdall 's watch ,</l>
        <l n="142">Past Midgard fortress , down to earth and men .</l>
        <l n="143">But he must tread a dark untravell 'd road</l>
        <l n="144">Which branches from the north of Heaven , and ride</l>
        <l n="145">Nine days , nine nights , toward the northern ice ,</l>
        <l n="146">Through valleys deep-engulph 'd , with roaring streams .</l>
        <l n="147">And he will reach on the tenth morn a bridge</l>
        <l n="148">Which spans with golden arches Giall 's stream ,</l>
        <l n="149">Not Bifrost , but that bridge a damsel keeps ,</l>
        <l n="150">Who tells the passing troops of dead their way</l>
        <l n="151">To the low shore of ghosts , and Hela 's realm .</l>
        <l n="152">And she will bid him northward steer his course .</l>
        <l n="153">Then he will journey through no lighted land ,</l>
        <l n="154">Nor see the sun arise , nor see it set ;</l>
        <l n="155">But he must ever watch the northern Bear ,</l>
        <l n="156">Who from her frozen height with jealous eye</l>
        <l n="157">Confronts the Dog and Hunter in the south ,</l>
        <l n="158">And is alone not dipt in Ocean 's stream .</l>
        <l n="159">And straight he will come down to Ocean 's strand —</l>
        <l n="160">Ocean , whose watery ring enfolds the world ,</l>
        <l n="161">And on whose marge the ancient giants dwell .</l>
        <l n="162">But he will reach its unknown northern shore ,</l>
        <l n="163">Far , far beyond the outmost giant 's home ,</l>
        <l n="164">At the chink 'd fields of ice , the waste of snow .</l>
        <l n="165">And he must fare across the dismal ice</l>
        <l n="166">Northward , until he meets a stretching wall</l>
        <l n="167">Barring his way , and in the wall a grate .</l>
        <l n="168">But then he must dismount , and on the ice</l>
        <l n="169">Tighten the girths of Sleipner , Odin 's horse ,</l>
        <l n="170">And make him leap the grate , and come within .</l>
        <l n="171">And he will see stretch round him Hela 's realm ,</l>
        <l n="172">The plains of Niflheim , where dwell the dead ,</l>
        <l n="173">And hear the roaring of the streams of Hell .</l>
        <l n="174">And he will see the feeble , shadowy tribes ,</l>
        <l n="175">And Balder sitting crown 'd , and Hela 's throne .</l>
        <l n="176">Then must he not regard the wailful ghosts</l>
        <l n="177">Who all will flit , like eddying leaves , around ;</l>
        <l n="178">But he must straight accost their solemn queen ,</l>
        <l n="179">And pay her homage , and entreat with prayers ,</l>
        <l n="180">Telling her all that grief they have in Heaven</l>
        <l n="181">For Balder , whom she holds by right below ;</l>
        <l n="182">If haply he may melt her heart with words ,</l>
        <l n="183">And make her yield , and give him Balder back . ”</l>
        <l n="184">She spoke ; but Hoder answer 'd her and said :—</l>
        <l n="185">“ Mother , a dreadful way is this thou show'st ;</l>
        <l n="186">No journey for a sightless God to go ! ”</l>
        <l n="187">And straight the mother of the Gods replied :—</l>
        <l n="188">“ Therefore thyself thou shalt not go , my son .</l>
        <l n="189">But he whom first thou meetest when thou com'st</l>
        <l n="190">To Asgard , and declar'st this hidden way ,</l>
        <l n="191">Shall go ; and I will be his guide unseen . ”</l>
        <l n="192">She spoke , and on her face let fall her veil ,</l>
        <l n="193">And bow 'd her head , and sate with folded hands ,</l>
        <l n="194">But at the central hearth those women old ,</l>
        <l n="195">Who while the Mother spake had ceased their toil ,</l>
        <l n="196">Began again to heap the sacred fire .</l>
        <l n="197">And Hoder turn 'd , and left his mother 's house ,</l>
        <l n="198">Fensaler , whose lit windows look to sea ;</l>
        <l n="199">And came again down to the roaring waves ,</l>
        <l n="200">And back along the beach to Asgard went ,</l>
        <l n="201">Pondering on that which Frea said should be .</l>
        <l n="202">But night came down , and darken 'd Asgard streets</l>
        <l n="203">Then from their loathéd feasts the Gods arose ,</l>
        <l n="204">And lighted torches , and took up the corpse</l>
        <l n="205">Of Balder from the floor of Odin 's hall ,</l>
        <l n="206">And laid it on a bier , and bare him home</l>
        <l n="207">Through the fast-darkening streets to his own house ,</l>
        <l n="208">Breidablik , on whose columns Balder graved</l>
        <l n="209">The enchantments that recall the dead to life .</l>
        <l n="210">For wise he was , and many curious arts ,</l>
        <l n="211">Postures of runes , and healing herbs he knew ;</l>
        <l n="212">Unhappy ! but that art he did not know ,</l>
        <l n="213">To keep his own life safe , and see the sun .</l>
        <l n="214">There to his hall the Gods brought Balder home ,</l>
        <l n="215">And each bespake him as he laid him down :—</l>
        <l n="216">“ Would that ourselves , O Balder , we were borne</l>
        <l n="217">Home to our halls , with torchlight , by our kin ,</l>
        <l n="218">So thou might'st live , and still delight the Gods ! ”</l>
        <l n="219">They spake ; and each went home to his own house .</l>
        <l n="220">But there was one , the first of all the Gods</l>
        <l n="221">For speed , and Hermod was his name in Heaven ;</l>
        <l n="222">Most fleet he was , but now he went the last ,</l>
        <l n="223">Heavy in heart for Balder , to his house ,</l>
        <l n="224">Which he in Asgard built him , there to dwell ,</l>
        <l n="225">Against the harbour , by the city-wall .</l>
        <l n="226">Him the blind Hoder met , as he came up</l>
        <l n="227">From the sea cityward , and knew his step ;</l>
        <l n="228">Nor yet could Hermod see his brother 's face ,</l>
        <l n="229">For it grew dark ; but Hoder touch 'd his arm .</l>
        <l n="230">And as a spray of honeysuckle flowers</l>
        <l n="231">Brushes across a tired traveller 's face</l>
        <l n="232">Who shuffles through the deep dew-moisten 'd dust ,</l>
        <l n="233">On a May evening , in the darken 'd lanes ,</l>
        <l n="234">And starts him , that he thinks a ghost went by —</l>
        <l n="235">So Hoder brush 'd by Hermod 's side , and said :—</l>
        <l n="236">“ Take Sleipner , Hermod , and set forth with dawn</l>
        <l n="237">To Hela 's kingdom , to ask Balder back ;</l>
        <l n="238">And they shall be thy guides , who have the power . ”</l>
        <l n="239">He spake , and brush 'd soft by , and disappear 'd .</l>
        <l n="240">And Hermod gazed into the night , and said :—</l>
        <l n="241">“ Who is it utters through the dark his hest</l>
        <l n="242">So quickly , and will wait for no reply ?</l>
        <l n="243">The voice was like the unhappy Hoder 's voice .</l>
        <l n="244">Howbeit I will see , and do his hest ;</l>
        <l n="245">For there rang note divine in that command . ”</l>
        <l n="246">So speaking , the fleet-footed Hermod came</l>
        <l n="247">Home , and lay down to sleep in his own house ;</l>
        <l n="248">And all the Gods lay down in their own homes .</l>
        <l n="249">And Hoder too came home , distraught with grief ,</l>
        <l n="250">Loathing to meet , at dawn , the other Gods ;</l>
        <l n="251">And he went in , and shut the door , and fixt</l>
        <l n="252">His sword upright , and fell on it , and died .</l>
        <l n="253">But from the hill of Lidskialf Odin rose ,</l>
        <l n="254">The throne , from which his eye surveys the world ;</l>
        <l n="255">And mounted Sleipner , and in darkness rode</l>
        <l n="256">To Asgard . And the stars came out in heaven ,</l>
        <l n="257">High over Asgard , to light home the King .</l>
        <l n="258">But fiercely Odin gallop 'd , moved in heart ;</l>
        <l n="259">And swift to Asgard , to the gate , he came .</l>
        <l n="260">And terribly the hoofs of Sleipner rang</l>
        <l n="261">Along the flinty floor of Asgard streets ,</l>
        <l n="262">And the Gods trembled on their golden beds</l>
        <l n="263">Hearing the wrathful Father coming home —</l>
        <l n="264">For dread , for like a whirlwind , Odin came .</l>
        <l n="265">And to Valhalla 's gate he rode , and left</l>
        <l n="266">Sleipner ; and Sleipner went to his own stall ;</l>
        <l n="267">And in Valhalla Odin laid him down .</l>
        <l n="268">But in Breidablik , Nanna , Balder 's wife ,</l>
        <l n="269">Came with the Goddesses who wrought her will ,</l>
        <l n="270">And stood by Balder lying on his bier .</l>
        <l n="271">And at his head and feet she station 'd Scalds</l>
        <l n="272">Who in their lives were famous for their song ;</l>
        <l n="273">These o'er the corpse intoned a plaintive strain ,</l>
        <l n="274">A dirge — and Nanna and her train replied .</l>
        <l n="275">And far into the night they wail 'd their dirge .</l>
        <l n="276">But when their souls were satisfied with wail ,</l>
        <l n="277">They went , and laid them down , and Nanna went</l>
        <l n="278">Into an upper chamber , and lay down ;</l>
        <l n="279">And Frea seal 'd her tired lids with sleep .</l>
        <l n="280">And ‘ twas when night is bordering hard on dawn ,</l>
        <l n="281">When air is chilliest , and the stars sunk low ;</l>
        <l n="282">Then Balder 's spirit through the gloom drew near ,</l>
        <l n="283">In garb , in form , in feature as he was ,</l>
        <l n="284">Alive ; and still the rays were round his head</l>
        <l n="285">Which were his glorious mark in Heaven ; he stood</l>
        <l n="286">Over against the curtain of the bed ,</l>
        <l n="287">And gazed on Nanna as she slept , and spake :—</l>
        <l n="288">“ Poor lamb , thou sleepest , and forgett'st thy woe !</l>
        <l n="289">Tears stand upon the lashes of thine eyes ,</l>
        <l n="290">Tears wet the pillow by thy cheek ; but thou ,</l>
        <l n="291">Like a young child , hast cried thyself to sleep .</l>
        <l n="292">Sleep on ; I watch thee , and am here to aid .</l>
        <l n="293">Alive I kept not far from thee , dear soul !</l>
        <l n="294">Neither do I neglect thee now , though dead .</l>
        <l n="295">For with to-morrow 's dawn the Gods prepare</l>
        <l n="296">To gather wood , and build a funeral-pile</l>
        <l n="297">Upon my ship , and burn my corpse with fire ,</l>
        <l n="298">That sad , sole honour of the dead ; and thee</l>
        <l n="299">They think to burn , and all my choicest wealth ,</l>
        <l n="300">With me , for thus ordains the common rite .</l>
        <l n="301">But it shall not be so ; but mild , but swift ,</l>
        <l n="302">But painless shall a stroke from Frea come ,</l>
        <l n="303">To cut thy thread of life , and free thy soul ,</l>
        <l n="304">And they shall burn thy corpse with mine , not thee .</l>
        <l n="305">And well I know that by no stroke of death ,</l>
        <l n="306">Tardy or swift , would'st thou be loath to die ,</l>
        <l n="307">So it restored thee , Nanna , to my side ,</l>
        <l n="308">Whom thou so well hast loved ; but I can smooth</l>
        <l n="309">Thy way , and this , at least , my prayers avail .</l>
        <l n="310">Yes , and I fain would altogether ward</l>
        <l n="311">Death from thy head , and with the Gods in Heaven</l>
        <l n="312">Prolong thy life , though not by thee desired —</l>
        <l n="313">But right bars this , not only thy desire .</l>
        <l n="314">Yet dreary , Nanna , is the life they lead</l>
        <l n="315">In that dim world , in Hela 's mouldering realm ;</l>
        <l n="316">And doleful are the ghosts , the troops of dead ,</l>
        <l n="317">Whom Hela with austere control presides .</l>
        <l n="318">For of the race of Gods is no one there ,</l>
        <l n="319">Save me alone , and Hela , solemn queen ;</l>
        <l n="320">And all the nobler souls of mortal men</l>
        <l n="321">On battle-field have met their death , and now</l>
        <l n="322">Feast in Valhalla , in my father 's hall ;</l>
        <l n="323">Only the inglorious sort are there below ,</l>
        <l n="324">The old , the cowards , and the weak are there —</l>
        <l n="325">Men spent by sickness , or obscure decay .</l>
        <l n="326">But even there , O Nanna , we might find</l>
        <l n="327">Some solace in each other 's look and speech ,</l>
        <l n="328">Wandering together through that gloomy world ,</l>
        <l n="329">And talking of the life we led in Heaven ,</l>
        <l n="330">While we yet lived , among the other Gods . ”</l>
        <l n="331">He spake , and straight his lineaments began</l>
        <l n="332">To fade ; and Nanna in her sleep stretch 'd out</l>
        <l n="333">Her arms towards him with a cry — but he</l>
        <l n="334">Mournfully shook his head , and disappear 'd .</l>
        <l n="335">And as the woodman sees a little smoke</l>
        <l n="336">Hang in the air , afield , and disappear ,</l>
        <l n="337">So Balder faded in the night away .</l>
        <l n="338">And Nanna on her bed sank back ; but then</l>
        <l n="339">Frea , the mother of the Gods , with stroke</l>
        <l n="340">Painless and swift , set free her airy soul ,</l>
        <l n="341">Which took , on Balder 's track , the way below ;</l>
        <l n="342">And instantly the sacred morn appear 'd .</l>

      <head>2 . JOURNEY TO THE DEAD</head>
       <l n="1">Forth from the east , up the ascent of Heaven ,</l>
       <l n="2">Day drove his courser with the shining mane ;</l>
       <l n="3">And in Valhalla , from his gable-perch ,</l>
       <l n="4">The golden-crested cock began to crow .</l>
       <l n="5">Hereafter , in the blackest dead of night ,</l>
       <l n="6">With shrill and dismal cries that bird shall crow ,</l>
       <l n="7">Warning the Gods that foes draw nigh to Heaven ;</l>
       <l n="8">But now he crew at dawn , a cheerful note ,</l>
       <l n="9">To wake the Gods and Heroes to their tasks .</l>
       <l n="10">And all the Gods , and all the Heroes , woke .</l>
       <l n="11">And from their beds the Heroes rose , and donn 'd</l>
       <l n="12">Their arms , and led their horses from the stall ,</l>
       <l n="13">And mounted them , and in Valhalla 's court</l>
       <l n="14">Were ranged ; and then the daily fray began .</l>
       <l n="15">And all day long they there are hack 'd and hewn ,</l>
       <l n="16">‘ Mid dust , and groans , and limbs lopp 'd off , and blood ;</l>
       <l n="17">But all at night return to Odin 's hall ,</l>
       <l n="18">Woundless and fresh ; such lot is theirs in Heaven .</l>
       <l n="19">And the Valkyries on their steeds went forth</l>
       <l n="20">Tow'rd earth and fights of men ; and at their side</l>
       <l n="21">Skulda , the youngest of the Nornies , rode ;</l>
       <l n="22">And over Bifrost , where is Heimdall 's watch ,</l>
       <l n="23">Past Midgard fortress , down to earth they came ;</l>
       <l n="24">There through some battle-field , where men fall fast ,</l>
       <l n="25">Their horses fetlock-deep in blood , they ride ,</l>
       <l n="26">And pick the bravest warriors out for death ,</l>
       <l n="27">Whom they bring back with them at night to Heaven</l>
       <l n="28">To glad the Gods , and feast in Odin 's hall .</l>
       <l n="29">But the Gods went not now , as otherwhile ,</l>
       <l n="30">Into the tilt-yard , where the Heroes fought ,</l>
       <l n="31">To feast their eyes with looking on the fray ;</l>
       <l n="32">Nor did they to their judgment-place repair</l>
       <l n="33">By the ash Igdrasil , in Ida 's plain ,</l>
       <l n="34">Where they hold council , and give laws for men .</l>
       <l n="35">But they went , Odin first , the rest behind ,</l>
       <l n="36">To the hall Gladheim , which is built of gold ;</l>
       <l n="37">Where are in circle ranged twelve golden chairs ,</l>
       <l n="38">And in the midst one higher , Odin 's throne .</l>
       <l n="39">There all the Gods in silence sate them down ;</l>
       <l n="40">And thus the Father of the ages spake :—</l>
       <l n="41">“ Go quickly , Gods , bring wood to the seashore ,</l>
       <l n="42">With all , which it beseems the dead to have ,</l>
       <l n="43">And make a funeral-pile on Balder 's ship ;</l>
       <l n="44">On the twelfth day the Gods shall burn his corpse .</l>
       <l n="45">But Hermod , thou , take Sleipner , and ride down</l>
       <l n="46">To Hela 's kingdom , to ask Balder back . ”</l>
       <l n="47">So said he ; and the Gods arose , and took</l>
       <l n="48">Axes and ropes , and at their head came Thor ,</l>
       <l n="49">Shouldering his hammer , which the giants know .</l>
       <l n="50">Forth wended they , and drave their steeds before .</l>
       <l n="51">And up the dewy mountain-tracks they fared</l>
       <l n="52">To the dark forests , in the early dawn ;</l>
       <l n="53">And up and down , and side and slant they roam 'd .</l>
       <l n="54">And from the glens all day an echo came</l>
       <l n="55">Of crashing falls ; for with his hammer Thor</l>
       <l n="56">Smote ‘ mid the rocks the lichen-bearded pines ,</l>
       <l n="57">And burst their roots , while to their tops the Gods</l>
       <l n="58">Made fast the woven ropes , and haled them down ,</l>
       <l n="59">And lopp 'd their boughs , and clove them on the sward ,</l>
       <l n="60">And bound the logs behind their steeds to draw ,</l>
       <l n="61">And drave them homeward ; and the snorting steeds</l>
       <l n="62">Went straining through the crackling brushwood down ,</l>
       <l n="63">And by the darkling forest-paths the Gods</l>
       <l n="64">Follow 'd , and on their shoulders carried boughs .</l>
       <l n="65">And they came out upon the plain , and pass 'd</l>
       <l n="66">Asgard , and led their horses to the beach ,</l>
       <l n="67">And loosed them of their loads on the seashore ,</l>
       <l n="68">And ranged the wood in stacks by Balder 's ship ;</l>
       <l n="69">And every God went home to his own house .</l>
       <l n="70">But when the Gods were to the forest gone ,</l>
       <l n="71">Hermod led Sleipner from Valhalla forth</l>
       <l n="72">And saddled him ; before that , Sleipner brook 'd</l>
       <l n="73">No meaner hand than Odin 's on his mane ,</l>
       <l n="74">On his broad back no lesser rider bore ;</l>
       <l n="75">Yet docile now he stood at Hermod 's side ,</l>
       <l n="76">Arching his neck , and glad to be bestrode ,</l>
       <l n="77">Knowing the God they went to seek , how dear .</l>
       <l n="78">But Hermod mounted him , and sadly fared</l>
       <l n="79">In silence up the dark untravell 'd road</l>
       <l n="80">Which branches from the north of Heaven , and went</l>
       <l n="81">All day ; and daylight waned , and night came on .</l>
       <l n="82">And all that night he rode , and journey 'd so ,</l>
       <l n="83">Nine days , nine nights , toward the northern ice ,</l>
       <l n="84">Through valleys deep-engulph 'd , by roaring streams .</l>
       <l n="85">And on the tenth morn he beheld the bridge</l>
       <l n="86">Which spans with golden arches Giall 's stream ,</l>
       <l n="87">And on the bridge a damsel watching arm 'd ,</l>
       <l n="88">In the strait passage , at the farther end ,</l>
       <l n="89">Where the road issues between walling rocks .</l>
       <l n="90">Scant space that warder left for passers by ;—</l>
       <l n="91">But as when cowherds in October drive</l>
       <l n="92">Their kine across a snowy mountain-pass</l>
       <l n="93">To winter-pasture on the southern side ,</l>
       <l n="94">And on the ridge a waggon chokes the way ,</l>
       <l n="95">Wedged in the snow ; then painfully the hinds</l>
       <l n="96">With goad and shouting urge their cattle past ,</l>
       <l n="97">Plunging through deep untrodden banks of snow</l>
       <l n="98">To right and left , and warm steam fills the air —</l>
       <l n="99">So on the bridge that damsel block 'd the way ,</l>
       <l n="100">And question 'd Hermod as he came , and said :—</l>
       <l n="101">“ Who art thou on thy black and fiery horse</l>
       <l n="102">Under whose hoofs the bridge o'er Giall 's stream</l>
       <l n="103">Rumbles and shakes ? Tell me thy race and home .</l>
       <l n="104">But yestermorn , five troops of dead pass 'd by ,</l>
       <l n="105">Bound on their way below to Hela 's realm ,</l>
       <l n="106">Nor shook the bridge so much as thou alone .</l>
       <l n="107">And thou hast flesh and colour on thy cheeks ,</l>
       <l n="108">Like men who live , and draw the vital air ;</l>
       <l n="109">Nor look'st thou pale and wan , like men deceased ,</l>
       <l n="110">Souls bound below , my daily passers here . ”</l>
       <l n="111">And the fleet-footed Hermod answer 'd her :—</l>
       <l n="112">“ O damsel , Hermod am I call 'd , the son</l>
       <l n="113">Of Odin ; and my high-roof 'd house is built</l>
       <l n="114">Far hence , in Asgard , in the city of Gods ;</l>
       <l n="115">And Sleipner , Odin 's horse , is this I ride .</l>
       <l n="116">And I come , sent this road on Balder 's track ;</l>
       <l n="117">Say then , if he hath cross 'd thy bridge or no ? ”</l>
       <l n="118">He spake ; the warder of the bridge replied :—</l>
       <l n="119">“ O Hermod , rarely do the feet of Gods</l>
       <l n="120">Or of the horses of the Gods resound</l>
       <l n="121">Upon my bridge ; and , when they cross , I know .</l>
       <l n="122">Balder hath gone this way , and ta'en the road</l>
       <l n="123">Below there , to the north , tow'rd Hela 's realm .</l>
       <l n="124">From here the cold white mist can be discern 'd ,</l>
       <l n="125">Nor lit with sun , but through the darksome air</l>
       <l n="126">By the dim vapour-blotted light of stars ,</l>
       <l n="127">Which hangs over the ice where lies the road .</l>
       <l n="128">For in that ice are lost those northern streams ,</l>
       <l n="129">Freezing and ridging in their onward flow ,</l>
       <l n="130">Which from the fountain of Vergelmer run ,</l>
       <l n="131">The spring that bubbles up by Hela 's throne .</l>
       <l n="132">There are the joyless seats , the haunt of ghosts ,</l>
       <l n="133">Hela 's pale swarms ; and there was Balder bound .</l>
       <l n="134">Ride on ! pass free ! but he by this is there . ”</l>
       <l n="135">She spake , and stepp 'd aside , and left him room .</l>
       <l n="136">And Hermod greeted her , and gallop 'd by</l>
       <l n="137">Across the bridge ; then she took post again .</l>
       <l n="138">But northward Hermod rode , the way below ;</l>
       <l n="139">And o'er a darksome tract , which knows no sun ,</l>
       <l n="140">But by the blotted light of stars , he fared .</l>
       <l n="141">And he came down to Ocean 's northern strand ,</l>
       <l n="142">At the drear ice , beyond the giants ’ home .</l>
       <l n="143">Thence on he journey 'd o'er the fields of ice</l>
       <l n="144">Still north , until he met a stretching wall</l>
       <l n="145">Barring his way , and in the wall a grate .</l>
       <l n="146">Then he dismounted , and drew tight the girths ,</l>
       <l n="147">On the smooth ice , of Sleipner , Odin 's horse ,</l>
       <l n="148">And made him leap the grate , and came within .</l>
       <l n="149">And he beheld spread round him Hela 's realm ,</l>
       <l n="150">The plains of Niflheim , where dwell the dead ,</l>
       <l n="151">And heard the thunder of the streams of Hell .</l>
       <l n="152">For near the wall the river of Roaring flows ,</l>
       <l n="153">Outmost ; the others near the centre run —</l>
       <l n="154">The Storm , the Abyss , the Howling , and the Pain ;</l>
       <l n="155">These flow by Hela 's throne , and near their spring .</l>
       <l n="156">And from the dark flock 'd up the shadowy tribes ;—</l>
       <l n="157">And as the swallows crowd the bulrush-beds</l>
       <l n="158">Of some clear river , issuing from a lake ,</l>
       <l n="159">On autumn-days , before they cross the sea ;</l>
       <l n="160">And to each bulrush-crest a swallow hangs</l>
       <l n="161">Quivering , and others skim the river-streams ,</l>
       <l n="162">And their quick twittering fills the banks and shores —</l>
       <l n="163">So around Hermod swarm 'd the twittering ghosts .</l>
       <l n="164">Women , and infants , and young men who died</l>
       <l n="165">Too soon for fame , with white ungraven shields ;</l>
       <l n="166">And old men , known to glory , but their star</l>
       <l n="167">Betray 'd them , and of wasting age they died ,</l>
       <l n="168">Not wounds ; yet , dying , they their armour wore ,</l>
       <l n="169">And now have chief regard in Hela 's realm .</l>
       <l n="170">Behind flock 'd wrangling up a piteous crew ,</l>
       <l n="171">Greeted of none , disfeatured and forlorn —</l>
       <l n="172">Cowards , who were in sloughs interr 'd alive ;</l>
       <l n="173">And round them still the wattled hurdles hung ,</l>
       <l n="174">Wherewith they stamp 'd them down , and trod them deep ,</l>
       <l n="175">To hide their shameful memory from men .</l>
       <l n="176">But all he pass 'd unhail 'd , and reach 'd the throne</l>
       <l n="177">Of Hela , and saw , near it , Balder crown 'd ,</l>
       <l n="178">And Hela set thereon , with countenance stern ;</l>
       <l n="179">And thus bespake him first the solemn queen :—</l>
       <l n="180">“ Unhappy , how hast thou endured to leave</l>
       <l n="181">The light , and journey to the cheerless land</l>
       <l n="182">Where idly flit about the feeble shades ?</l>
       <l n="183">How didst thou cross the bridge o'er Giall 's stream ,</l>
       <l n="184">Being alive , and come to Ocean 's shore ?</l>
       <l n="185">Or how o'erleap the grate that bars the wall ? ”</l>
       <l n="186">She spake : but down off Sleipner Hermod sprang ,</l>
       <l n="187">And fell before her feet , and clasp 'd her knees ;</l>
       <l n="188">And spake , and mild entreated her , and said :—</l>
       <l n="189">“ O Hela , wherefore should the Gods declare</l>
       <l n="190">Their errands to each other , or the ways</l>
       <l n="191">They go ? the errand and the way is known .</l>
       <l n="192">Thou know'st , thou know'st , what grief we have in Heaven</l>
       <l n="193">For Balder , whom thou hold'st by right below .</l>
       <l n="194">Restore him ! for what part fulfils he here ?</l>
       <l n="195">Shall he shed cheer over the cheerless seats ,</l>
       <l n="196">And touch the apathetic ghosts with joy ?</l>
       <l n="197">Not for such end , O queen , thou hold'st thy realm .</l>
       <l n="198">For Heaven was Balder born , the city of Gods</l>
       <l n="199">And Heroes , where they live in light and joy .</l>
       <l n="200">Thither restore him , for his place is there ! ”</l>
       <l n="201">He spoke ; and grave replied the solemn queen :—</l>
       <l n="202">“ Hermod , for he thou art , thou son of Heaven !</l>
       <l n="203">A strange unlikely errand , sure , is thine .</l>
       <l n="204">Do the Gods send to me to make them blest ?</l>
       <l n="205">Small bliss my race hath of the Gods obtained .</l>
       <l n="206">Three mighty children to my father Lok</l>
       <l n="207">Did Angerbode , the giantess , bring forth —</l>
       <l n="208">Fenris the wolf , the Serpent huge , and me .</l>
       <l n="209">Of these the Serpent in the sea ye cast ,</l>
       <l n="210">Who since in your despite hath wax 'd amain ,</l>
       <l n="211">And now with gleaming ring enfolds the world ;</l>
       <l n="212">Me on this cheerless nether world ye threw ,</l>
       <l n="213">And gave me nine unlighted realms to rule ;</l>
       <l n="214">While on his island in the lake afar ,</l>
       <l n="215">Made fast to the bored crag , by wile not strength</l>
       <l n="216">Subdued , with limber chains lives Fenris bound .</l>
       <l n="217">Lok still subsists in Heaven , our father wise ,</l>
       <l n="218">Your mate , though loathed , and feasts in Odin 's hall ;</l>
       <l n="219">But him too foes await , and netted snares ,</l>
       <l n="220">And in a cave a bed of needle-rocks ,</l>
       <l n="221">And o'er his visage serpents dropping gall .</l>
       <l n="222">Yet he shall one day rise , and burst his bonds ,</l>
       <l n="223">And with himself set us his offspring free ,</l>
       <l n="224">When he guides Muspel 's children to their bourne .</l>
       <l n="225">Till then in peril or in pain we live ,</l>
       <l n="226">Wrought by the Gods — and ask the Gods our aid ?</l>
       <l n="227">Howbeit , we abide our day ; till then ,</l>
       <l n="228">We do not as some feebler haters do —</l>
       <l n="229">Seek to afflict our foes with petty pangs ,</l>
       <l n="230">Helpless to better us , or ruin them .</l>
       <l n="231">Come then ! if Balder was so dear beloved ,</l>
       <l n="232">And this is true , and such a loss is Heaven 's —</l>
       <l n="233">Hear , how to Heaven may Balder be restored .</l>
       <l n="234">Show me through all the world the signs of grief !</l>
       <l n="235">Fails but one thing to grieve , here Balder stops !</l>
       <l n="236">Let all that lives and moves upon the earth</l>
       <l n="237">Weep him , and all that is without life weep ;</l>
       <l n="238">Let Gods , men , brutes , beweep him ; plants and stones !</l>
       <l n="239">So shall I know the lost was dear indeed ,</l>
       <l n="240">And bend my heart , and give him back to Heaven . ”</l>
       <l n="241">She spake ; and Hermod answer 'd her , and said :—</l>
       <l n="242">“ Hela , such as thou say'st , the terms shall be .</l>
       <l n="243">But come , declare me this , and truly tell :</l>
       <l n="244">May I , ere I depart , bid Balder hail ,</l>
       <l n="245">Or is it here withheld to greet the dead ? ”</l>
       <l n="246">He spake , and straightway Hela answered him :—</l>
       <l n="247">“ Hermod , greet Balder if thou wilt , and hold</l>
       <l n="248">Converse ; his speech remains , though he be dead . ”</l>
       <l n="249">And straight to Balder Hermod turn 'd , and spake :—</l>
       <l n="250">“ Even in the abode of death , O Balder , hail !</l>
       <l n="251">Thou hear'st , if hearing , like as speech , is thine ,</l>
       <l n="252">The terms of thy releasement hence to Heaven ;</l>
       <l n="253">Fear nothing but that all shall be fulfill 'd .</l>
       <l n="254">For not unmindful of thee are the Gods ,</l>
       <l n="255">Who see the light , and blest in Asgard dwell ;</l>
       <l n="256">Even here they seek thee out , in Hela 's realm .</l>
       <l n="257">And sure of all the happiest far art thou</l>
       <l n="258">Who ever have been known in earth or Heaven ;</l>
       <l n="259">Alive , thou wast of Gods the most beloved ,</l>
       <l n="260">And now thou sittest crown 'd by Hela 's side ,</l>
       <l n="261">Here , and hast honour among all the dead . ”</l>
       <l n="262">He spake ; and Balder utter 'd him reply ,</l>
       <l n="263">But feebly , as a voice far off ; he said :—</l>
       <l n="264">“ Hermod the nimble , gild me not my death !</l>
       <l n="265">Better to live a serf , a captured man ,</l>
       <l n="266">Who scatters rushes in a master 's hall ,</l>
       <l n="267">Than be a crown 'd king here , and rule the dead .</l>
       <l n="268">And now I count not of these terms as safe</l>
       <l n="269">To be fulfill 'd , nor my return as sure ,</l>
       <l n="270">Though I be loved , and many mourn my death ;</l>
       <l n="271">For double-minded ever was the seed</l>
       <l n="272">Of Lok , and double are the gifts they give .</l>
       <l n="273">Howbeit , report thy message ; and therewith ,</l>
       <l n="274">To Odin , to my father , take this ring ,</l>
       <l n="275">Memorial of me , whether saved or no ;</l>
       <l n="276">And tell the Heaven-born Gods how thou hast seen</l>
       <l n="277">Me sitting here below by Hela 's side ,</l>
       <l n="278">Crown 'd , having honour among all the dead . ”</l>
       <l n="279">He spake , and raised his hand , and gave the ring .</l>
       <l n="280">And with inscrutable regard the queen</l>
       <l n="281">Of Hell beheld them , and the ghosts stood dumb .</l>
       <l n="282">But Hermod took the ring , and yet once more</l>
       <l n="283">Kneel 'd and did homage to the solemn queen ;</l>
       <l n="284">Then mounted Sleipner , and set forth to ride</l>
       <l n="285">Back , through the astonish 'd tribes of dead , to Heaven .</l>
       <l n="286">And to the wall he came , and found the grate</l>
       <l n="287">Lifted , and issued on the fields of ice .</l>
       <l n="288">And o'er the ice he fared to Ocean 's strand ,</l>
       <l n="289">And up from thence , a wet and misty road ,</l>
       <l n="290">To the arm 'd damsel 's bridge , and Giall 's stream .</l>
       <l n="291">Worse was that way to go than to return ,</l>
       <l n="292">For him ;— for others all return is barr 'd .</l>
       <l n="293">Nine days he took to go , two to return ,</l>
       <l n="294">And on the twelfth morn saw the light of Heaven .</l>
       <l n="295">And as a traveller in the early dawn</l>
       <l n="296">To the steep edge of some great valley comes ,</l>
       <l n="297">Through which a river flows , and sees , beneath ,</l>
       <l n="298">Clouds of white rolling vapours fill the vale ,</l>
       <l n="299">But o'er them , on the farther slope , descries</l>
       <l n="300">Vineyards , and crofts , and pastures , bright with sun —</l>
       <l n="301">So Hermod , o'er the fog between , saw Heaven .</l>
       <l n="302">And Sleipner snorted , for he smelt the air</l>
       <l n="303">Of Heaven ; and mightily , as wing 'd , he flew .</l>
       <l n="304">And Hermod saw the towers of Asgard rise ;</l>
       <l n="305">And he drew near , and heard no living voice</l>
       <l n="306">In Asgard ; and the golden halls were dumb .</l>
       <l n="307">Then Hermod knew what labour held the Gods ;</l>
       <l n="308">And through the empty streets he rode , and pass 'd</l>
       <l n="309">Under the gate-house to the sands , and found</l>
       <l n="310">The Gods on the sea-shore by Balder 's ship .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The Gods held talk together , group 'd in knots ,</l>
       <l n="2">Round Balder 's corpse , which they had thither borne ;</l>
       <l n="3">And Hermod came down tow'rds them from the gate .</l>
       <l n="4">And Lok , the father of the serpent , first</l>
       <l n="5">Beheld him come , and to his neighbour spake :—</l>
       <l n="6">“ See , here is Hermod , who comes single back</l>
       <l n="7">From Hell ; and shall I tell thee how he seems ?</l>
       <l n="8">Like as a farmer , who hath lost his dog ,</l>
       <l n="9">Some morn , at market , in a crowded town —</l>
       <l n="10">Through many streets the poor beast runs in vain ,</l>
       <l n="11">And follows this man after that , for hours ;</l>
       <l n="12">And , late at evening , spent and panting , falls</l>
       <l n="13">Before a stranger 's threshold , not his home ,</l>
       <l n="14">With flanks a-tremble , and his slender tongue</l>
       <l n="15">Hangs quivering out between his dust-smear 'd jaws ,</l>
       <l n="16">And piteously he eyes the passers by ;</l>
       <l n="17">But home his master comes to his own farm ,</l>
       <l n="18">Far in the country , wondering where he is —</l>
       <l n="19">So Hermod comes to-day unfollow 'd home . ”</l>
       <l n="20">And straight his neighbour , moved with wrath , replied :—</l>
       <l n="21">“ Deceiver ! fair in form , but false in heart !</l>
       <l n="22">Enemy , mocker , whom , though Gods , we hate —</l>
       <l n="23">Peace , lest our father Odin hear thee gibe !</l>
       <l n="24">Would I might see him snatch thee in his hand ,</l>
       <l n="25">And bind thy carcase , like a bale , with cords ,</l>
       <l n="26">And hurl thee in a lake , to sink or swim !</l>
       <l n="27">If clear from plotting Balder 's death , to swim ;</l>
       <l n="28">But deep , if thou devisedst it , to drown ,</l>
       <l n="29">And perish , against fate , before thy day . ”</l>
       <l n="30">So they two soft to one another spake .</l>
       <l n="31">But Odin look 'd toward the land , and saw</l>
       <l n="32">His messenger ; and he stood forth , and cried .</l>
       <l n="33">And Hermod came , and leapt from Sleipner down ,</l>
       <l n="34">And in his father 's hand put Sleipner 's rein ,</l>
       <l n="35">And greeted Odin and the Gods , and said :—</l>
       <l n="36">“ Odin , my father , and ye , Gods of Heaven !</l>
       <l n="37">Lo , home , having perform 'd your will , I come .</l>
       <l n="38">Into the joyless kingdom have I been ,</l>
       <l n="39">Below , and look 'd upon the shadowy tribes</l>
       <l n="40">Of ghosts , and communed with their solemn queen ;</l>
       <l n="41">And to your prayer she sends you this reply :</l>
       <l n="42">Show her through all the world the signs of grief !</l>
       <l n="43">Fails but one thing to grieve , there Balder stops !</l>
       <l n="44">Let Gods , men , brutes , beweep him ; plants and stones :</l>
       <l n="45">So shall she know your loss was dear indeed ,</l>
       <l n="46">And bend her heart , and give you Balder back . ”</l>
       <l n="47">He spoke ; and all the Gods to Odin look 'd ;</l>
       <l n="48">And straight the Father of the ages said :—</l>
       <l n="49">“ Ye Gods , these terms may keep another day .</l>
       <l n="50">But now , put on your arms , and mount your steeds ,</l>
       <l n="51">And in procession all come near , and weep</l>
       <l n="52">Balder ; for that is what the dead desire .</l>
       <l n="53">When ye enough have wept , then build a pile</l>
       <l n="54">Of the heap 'd wood , and burn his corpse with fire</l>
       <l n="55">Out of our sight ; that we may turn from grief ,</l>
       <l n="56">And lead , as erst , our daily life in Heaven . ”</l>
       <l n="57">He spoke , and the Gods arm 'd ; and Odin donn 'd</l>
       <l n="58">His dazzling corslet and his helm of gold ,</l>
       <l n="59">And led the way on Sleipner ; and the rest</l>
       <l n="60">Follow 'd , in tears , their father and their king .</l>
       <l n="61">And thrice in arms around the dead they rode ,</l>
       <l n="62">Weeping ; the sands were wetted , and their arms ,</l>
       <l n="63">With their thick-falling tears — so good a friend</l>
       <l n="64">They mourn 'd that day , so bright , so loved a God .</l>
       <l n="65">And Odin came , and laid his kingly hands</l>
       <l n="66">On Balder 's breast , and thus began the wail :—</l>
       <l n="67">“ Farewell , O Balder , bright and loved , my son !</l>
       <l n="68">In that great day , the twilight of the Gods ,</l>
       <l n="69">When Muspel 's children shall beleaguer Heaven ,</l>
       <l n="70">Then we shall miss thy counsel and thy arm . ”</l>
       <l n="71">Thou camest near the next , O warrior Thor !</l>
       <l n="72">Shouldering thy hammer , in thy chariot drawn ,</l>
       <l n="73">Swaying the long-hair 'd goats with silver 'd rein ;</l>
       <l n="74">And over Balder 's corpse these words didst say :—</l>
       <l n="75">“ Brother , thou dwellest in the darksome land ,</l>
       <l n="76">And talkest with the feeble tribes of ghosts ,</l>
       <l n="77">Now , and I know not how they prize thee there —</l>
       <l n="78">But here , I know , thou wilt be miss 'd and mourn 'd .</l>
       <l n="79">For haughty spirits and high wraths are rife</l>
       <l n="80">Among the Gods and Heroes here in Heaven ,</l>
       <l n="81">As among those whose joy and work is war ;</l>
       <l n="82">And daily strifes arise , and angry words .</l>
       <l n="83">But from thy lips , O Balder , night or day ,</l>
       <l n="84">Heard no one ever an injurious word</l>
       <l n="85">To God or Hero , but thou keptest back</l>
       <l n="86">The others , labouring to compose their brawls .</l>
       <l n="87">Be ye then kind , as Balder too was kind !</l>
       <l n="88">For we lose him , who smoothed all strife in Heaven . ”</l>
       <l n="89">He spake , and all the Gods assenting wail 'd .</l>
       <l n="90">And Freya next came nigh , with golden tears ;</l>
       <l n="91">The loveliest Goddess she in Heaven , by all</l>
       <l n="92">Most honour 'd after Frea , Odin 's wife .</l>
       <l n="93">Her long ago the wandering Oder took</l>
       <l n="94">To mate , but left her to roam distant lands ;</l>
       <l n="95">Since then she seeks him , and weeps tears of gold .</l>
       <l n="96">Names hath she many ; Vanadis on earth</l>
       <l n="97">They call her , Freya is her name in Heaven ;</l>
       <l n="98">She in her hands took Balder 's head , and spake :—</l>
       <l n="99">“ Balder , my brother , thou art gone a road</l>
       <l n="100">Unknown and long , and haply on that way</l>
       <l n="101">My long-lost wandering Oder thou hast met ,</l>
       <l n="102">For in the paths of Heaven he is not found .</l>
       <l n="103">Oh , if it be so , tell him what thou wast</l>
       <l n="104">To his neglected wife , and what he is ,</l>
       <l n="105">And wring his heart with shame , to hear thy word !</l>
       <l n="106">For he , my husband , left me here to pine ,</l>
       <l n="107">Not long a wife , when his unquiet heart</l>
       <l n="108">First drove him from me into distant lands ;</l>
       <l n="109">Since then I vainly seek him through the world ,</l>
       <l n="110">And weep from shore to shore my golden tears ,</l>
       <l n="111">But neither god nor mortal heeds my pain .</l>
       <l n="112">Thou only , Balder , wast for ever kind ,</l>
       <l n="113">To take my hand , and wipe my tears , and say :</l>
       <l n="114">Weep not , O Freya , weep no golden tears !</l>
       <l n="115">One day the wandering Oder will return ,</l>
       <l n="116">Or thou wilt find him in thy faithful search</l>
       <l n="117">On some great road , or resting in an inn ,</l>
       <l n="118">Or at a ford , or sleeping by a tree .</l>
       <l n="119">So Balder said ;— but Oder , well I know ,</l>
       <l n="120">My truant Oder I shall see no more</l>
       <l n="121">To the world 's end ; and Balder now is gone ,</l>
       <l n="122">And I am left uncomforted in Heaven . ”</l>
       <l n="123">She spake ; and all the Goddesses bewail 'd .</l>
       <l n="124">Last from among the Heroes one came near ,</l>
       <l n="125">No God , but of the hero-troop the chief —</l>
       <l n="126">Regner , who swept the northern sea with fleets ,</l>
       <l n="127">And ruled o'er Denmark and the heathy isles ,</l>
       <l n="128">Living ; but Ella captured him and slew ;—</l>
       <l n="129">A king whose fame then fill 'd the vast of Heaven ,</l>
       <l n="130">Now time obscures it , and men 's later deeds .</l>
       <l n="131">He last approach 'd the corpse , and spake , and said :—</l>
       <l n="132">“ Balder , there yet are many Scalds in Heaven</l>
       <l n="133">Still left , and that chief Scald , thy brother Brage ,</l>
       <l n="134">Whom we may bid to sing , though thou art gone .</l>
       <l n="135">And all these gladly , while we drink , we hear ,</l>
       <l n="136">After the feast is done , in Odin 's hall ;</l>
       <l n="137">But they harp ever on one string , and wake</l>
       <l n="138">Remembrance in our soul of wars alone ,</l>
       <l n="139">Such as on earth we valiantly have waged ,</l>
       <l n="140">And blood , and ringing blows , and violent death .</l>
       <l n="141">But when thou sangest , Balder , thou didst strike</l>
       <l n="142">Another note , and , like a bird in spring ,</l>
       <l n="143">Thy voice of joyance minded us , and youth ,</l>
       <l n="144">And wife , and children , and our ancient home .</l>
       <l n="145">Yes , and I , too , remember 'd then no more</l>
       <l n="146">My dungeon , where the serpents stung me dead ,</l>
       <l n="147">Nor Ella 's victory on the English coast —</l>
       <l n="148">But I heard Thora laugh in Gothland Isle ,</l>
       <l n="149">And saw my shepherdess , Aslauga , tend</l>
       <l n="150">Her flock along the white Norwegian beach .</l>
       <l n="151">Tears started to mine eyes with yearning joy .</l>
       <l n="152">Therefore with grateful heart I mourn thee dead . ”</l>
       <l n="153">So Regner spake , and all the Heroes groan 'd .</l>
       <l n="154">But now the sun had pass 'd the height of Heaven ,</l>
       <l n="155">And soon had all that day been spent in wail ;</l>
       <l n="156">But then the Father of the ages said :—</l>
       <l n="157">“ Ye Gods , there well may be too much of wail !</l>
       <l n="158">Bring now the gather 'd wood to Balder 's ship ;</l>
       <l n="159">Heap on the deck the logs , and build the pyre . ”</l>
       <l n="160">But when the Gods and Heroes heard , they brought</l>
       <l n="161">The wood to Balder 's ship , and built a pile ,</l>
       <l n="162">Full the deck 's breadth , and lofty ; then the corpse</l>
       <l n="163">Of Balder on the highest top they laid ,</l>
       <l n="164">With Nanna on his right , and on his left</l>
       <l n="165">Hoder , his brother , whom his own hand slew .</l>
       <l n="166">And they set jars of wine and oil to lean</l>
       <l n="167">Against the bodies , and stuck torches near ,</l>
       <l n="168">Splinters of pine-wood , soak 'd with turpentine ;</l>
       <l n="169">And brought his arms and gold , and all his stuff ,</l>
       <l n="170">And slew the dogs who at his table fed ,</l>
       <l n="171">And his horse , Balder 's horse , whom most he loved ,</l>
       <l n="172">And placed them on the pyre , and Odin threw</l>
       <l n="173">A last choice gift thereon , his golden ring .</l>
       <l n="174">The mast they fixt , and hoisted up the sails ,</l>
       <l n="175">Then they put fire to the wood ; and Thor</l>
       <l n="176">Set his stout shoulder hard against the stern</l>
       <l n="177">To push the ship through the thick sand ;— sparks flew</l>
       <l n="178">From the deep trench she plough 'd , so strong a God</l>
       <l n="179">Furrow 'd it ; and the water gurgled in .</l>
       <l n="180">And the ship floated on the waves , and rock 'd .</l>
       <l n="181">But in the hills a strong east-wind arose ,</l>
       <l n="182">And came down moaning to the sea ; first squalls</l>
       <l n="183">Ran black o'er the sea 's face , then steady rush 'd</l>
       <l n="184">The breeze , and fill 'd the sails , and blew the fire .</l>
       <l n="185">And wreathed in smoke the ship stood out to sea .</l>
       <l n="186">Soon with a roaring rose the mighty fire ,</l>
       <l n="187">And the pile crackled ; and between the logs</l>
       <l n="188">Sharp quivering tongues of flame shot out , and leapt ,</l>
       <l n="189">Curling and darting , higher , until they lick 'd</l>
       <l n="190">The summit of the pile , the dead , the mast ,</l>
       <l n="191">And ate the shrivelling sails ; but still the ship</l>
       <l n="192">Drove on , ablaze above her hull with fire .</l>
       <l n="193">And the Gods stood upon the beach , and gazed .</l>
       <l n="194">And while they gazed , the sun went lurid down</l>
       <l n="195">Into the smoke-wrapt sea , and night came on .</l>
       <l n="196">Then the wind fell , with night , and there was calm ;</l>
       <l n="197">But through the dark they watch 'd the burning ship</l>
       <l n="198">Still carried o'er the distant waters on ,</l>
       <l n="199">Farther and farther , like an eye of fire .</l>
       <l n="200">And long , in the far dark , blazed Balder 's pile ;</l>
       <l n="201">But fainter , as the stars rose high , it flared ,</l>
       <l n="202">The bodies were consumed , ash choked the pile .</l>
       <l n="203">And as , in a decaying winter-fire ,</l>
       <l n="204">A charr 'd log , falling , makes a shower of sparks —</l>
       <l n="205">So with a shower of sparks the pile fell in ,</l>
       <l n="206">Reddening the sea around ; and all was dark .</l>
       <l n="207">But the Gods went by starlight up the shore</l>
       <l n="208">To Asgard , and sate down in Odin 's hall</l>
       <l n="209">At table , and the funeral-feast began .</l>
       <l n="210">All night they ate the boar Serimner 's flesh ,</l>
       <l n="211">And from their horns , with silver rimm 'd , drank mead ,</l>
       <l n="212">Silent , and waited for the sacred morn .</l>
       <l n="213">And morning over all the world was spread .</l>
       <l n="214">Then from their loathéd feasts the Gods arose ,</l>
       <l n="215">And took their horses , and set forth to ride</l>
       <l n="216">O'er the bridge Bifrost , where is Heimdall 's watch ,</l>
       <l n="217">To the ash Igdrasil , and Ida 's plain ;</l>
       <l n="218">Thor came on foot , the rest on horseback rode .</l>
       <l n="219">And they found Mimir sitting by his fount</l>
       <l n="220">Of wisdom , which beneath the ashtree springs ;</l>
       <l n="221">And saw the Nornies watering the roots</l>
       <l n="222">Of that world-shadowing tree with honey-dew .</l>
       <l n="223">There came the Gods , and sate them down on stones ;</l>
       <l n="224">And thus the Father of the ages said :—</l>
       <l n="225">“ Ye Gods , the terms ye know , which Hermod brought .</l>
       <l n="226">Accept them or reject them ! both have grounds .</l>
       <l n="227">Accept them , and they bind us , unfulfill 'd ,</l>
       <l n="228">To leave for ever Balder in the grave ,</l>
       <l n="229">An unrecover 'd prisoner , shade with shades .</l>
       <l n="230">But how , ye say , should the fulfilment fail ?—</l>
       <l n="231">Smooth sound the terms , and light to be fulfill 'd ;</l>
       <l n="232">For dear-beloved was Balder while he lived</l>
       <l n="233">In Heaven and earth , and who would grudge him tears ?</l>
       <l n="234">But from the traitorous seed of Lok they come ,</l>
       <l n="235">These terms , and I suspect some hidden fraud .</l>
       <l n="236">Bethink ye , Gods , is there no other way ?—</l>
       <l n="237">Speak , were not this a way , the way for Gods ?</l>
       <l n="238">If I , if Odin , clad in radiant arms ,</l>
       <l n="239">Mounted on Sleipner , with the warrior Thor</l>
       <l n="240">Drawn in his car beside me , and my sons ,</l>
       <l n="241">All the strong brood of Heaven , to swell my train ,</l>
       <l n="242">Should make irruption into Hela 's realm ,</l>
       <l n="243">And set the fields of gloom ablaze with light ,</l>
       <l n="244">And bring in triumph Balder back to Heaven ? ”</l>
       <l n="245">He spake , and his fierce sons applauded loud .</l>
       <l n="246">But Frea , mother of the Gods , arose ,</l>
       <l n="247">Daughter and wife of Odin ; thus she said :—</l>
       <l n="248">“ Odin , thou whirlwind , what a threat is this !</l>
       <l n="249">Thou threatenest what transcends thy might , even thine .</l>
       <l n="250">For of all powers the mightiest far art thou ,</l>
       <l n="251">Lord over men on earth , and Gods in Heaven ;</l>
       <l n="252">Yet even from thee thyself hath been withheld</l>
       <l n="253">One thing — to undo what thou thyself hast ruled .</l>
       <l n="254">For all which hath been fixt , was fixt by thee .</l>
       <l n="255">In the beginning , ere the Gods were born ,</l>
       <l n="256">Before the Heavens were builded , thou didst slay</l>
       <l n="257">The giant Ymir , whom the abyss brought forth ,</l>
       <l n="258">Thou and thy brethren fierce , the sons of Bor ,</l>
       <l n="259">And cast his trunk to choke the abysmal void .</l>
       <l n="260">But of his flesh and members thou didst build</l>
       <l n="261">The earth and Ocean , and above them Heaven .</l>
       <l n="262">And from the flaming world , where Muspel reigns ,</l>
       <l n="263">Thou sent'st and fetched'st fire , and madest lights ,</l>
       <l n="264">Sun , moon , and stars , which thou hast hung in Heaven ,</l>
       <l n="265">Dividing clear the paths of night and day .</l>
       <l n="266">And Asgard thou didst build , and Midgard fort ;</l>
       <l n="267">Then me thou mad'st ; of us the Gods were born .</l>
       <l n="268">Last , walking by the sea , thou foundest spars</l>
       <l n="269">Of wood , and framed'st men , who till the earth ,</l>
       <l n="270">Or on the sea , the field of pirates , sail .</l>
       <l n="271">And all the race of Ymir thou didst drown ,</l>
       <l n="272">Save one , Bergelmer ;— he on shipboard fled</l>
       <l n="273">Thy deluge , and from him the giants sprang .</l>
       <l n="274">But all that brood thou hast removed far off ,</l>
       <l n="275">And set by Ocean 's utmost marge to dwell ;</l>
       <l n="276">But Hela into Niflheim thou threw'st ,</l>
       <l n="277">And gav'st her nine unlighted worlds to rule ,</l>
       <l n="278">A queen , and empire over all the dead .</l>
       <l n="279">That empire wilt thou now invade , light up</l>
       <l n="280">Her darkness , from her grasp a subject tear ?—</l>
       <l n="281">Try it ; but I , for one , will not applaud .</l>
       <l n="282">Nor do I merit , Odin , thou should'st slight</l>
       <l n="283">Me and my words , though thou be first in Heaven ;</l>
       <l n="284">For I too am a Goddess , born of thee ,</l>
       <l n="285">Thine eldest , and of me the Gods are sprung ;</l>
       <l n="286">And all that is to come I know , but lock</l>
       <l n="287">In mine own breast , and have to none reveal 'd .</l>
       <l n="288">Come then ! since Hela holds by right her prey ,</l>
       <l n="289">But offers terms for his release to Heaven ,</l>
       <l n="290">Accept the chance ; thou canst no more obtain .</l>
       <l n="291">Send through the world thy messengers ; entreat</l>
       <l n="292">All living and unliving things to weep</l>
       <l n="293">For Balder ; if thou haply thus may'st melt</l>
       <l n="294">Hela , and win the loved one back to Heaven . ”</l>
       <l n="295">She spake , and on her face let fall her veil ,</l>
       <l n="296">And bow 'd her head , and sate with folded hands .</l>
       <l n="297">Nor did the all-ruling Odin slight her word ;</l>
       <l n="298">Straightway he spake , and thus address 'd the Gods :</l>
       <l n="299">“ Go quickly forth through all the world , and pray</l>
       <l n="300">All living and unliving things to weep</l>
       <l n="301">Balder , if haply he may thus be won . ”</l>
       <l n="302">When the Gods heard , they straight arose , and took</l>
       <l n="303">Their horses , and rode forth through all the world ;</l>
       <l n="304">North , south , east , west , they struck , and roam 'd the world ,</l>
       <l n="305">Entreating all things to weep Balder 's death .</l>
       <l n="306">And all that lived , and all without life , wept .</l>
       <l n="307">And as in winter , when the frost breaks up ,</l>
       <l n="308">At winter 's end , before the spring begins ,</l>
       <l n="309">And a warm west-wind blows , and thaw sets in —</l>
       <l n="310">After an hour a dripping sound is heard</l>
       <l n="311">In all the forests , and the soft-strewn snow</l>
       <l n="312">Under the trees is dibbled-thick with holes ,</l>
       <l n="313">And from the boughs the snowloads shuffle down ;</l>
       <l n="314">And , in fields sloping to the south , dark plots</l>
       <l n="315">Of grass peep out amid surrounding snow ,</l>
       <l n="316">And widen , and the peasant 's heart is glad —</l>
       <l n="317">So through the world was heard a dripping noise</l>
       <l n="318">Of all things weeping to bring Balder back ;</l>
       <l n="319">And there fell joy upon the Gods to hear .</l>
       <l n="320">But Hermod rode with Niord , whom he took</l>
       <l n="321">To show him spits and beaches of the sea</l>
       <l n="322">Far off , where some unwarn 'd might fail to weep —</l>
       <l n="323">Niord , the God of storms , whom fishers know ;</l>
       <l n="324">Not born in Heaven ; he was in Vanheim rear 'd ,</l>
       <l n="325">With men , but lives a hostage with the Gods ;</l>
       <l n="326">He knows each frith , and every rocky creek</l>
       <l n="327">Fringed with dark pines , and sands where seafowl scream —</l>
       <l n="328">They two scour 'd every coast , and all things wept .</l>
       <l n="329">And they rode home together , through the wood</l>
       <l n="330">Of Jarnvid , which to east of Midgard lies</l>
       <l n="331">Bordering the giants , where the trees are iron ;</l>
       <l n="332">There in the wood before a cave they came ,</l>
       <l n="333">Where sate , in the cave 's mouth , a skinny hag ,</l>
       <l n="334">Toothless and old ; she gibes the passers by .</l>
       <l n="335">Thok is she call 'd , but now Lok wore her shape ;</l>
       <l n="336">She greeted them the first , and laugh 'd , and said :—</l>
       <l n="337">“ Ye Gods , good lack , is it so dull in Heaven ,</l>
       <l n="338">That ye come pleasuring to Thok 's iron wood ?</l>
       <l n="339">Lovers of change ye are , fastidious sprites .</l>
       <l n="340">Look , as in some boor 's yard a sweet-breath 'd cow ,</l>
       <l n="341">Whose manger is stuff 'd full of good fresh hay ,</l>
       <l n="342">Snuffs at it daintily , and stoops her head</l>
       <l n="343">To chew the straw , her litter , at her feet —</l>
       <l n="344">So ye grow squeamish , Gods , and sniff at Heaven ! ”</l>
       <l n="345">She spake ; but Hermod answer 'd her and said :—</l>
       <l n="346">“ Thok , not for gibes we come , we come for tears .</l>
       <l n="347">Balder is dead , and Hela holds her prey ,</l>
       <l n="348">But will restore , if all things give him tears .</l>
       <l n="349">Begrudge not thine ! to all was Balder dear . ”</l>
       <l n="350">Then , with a louder laugh , the hag replied :—</l>
       <l n="351">“ Is Balder dead ? and do ye come for tears ?</l>
       <l n="352">Thok with dry eyes will weep o'er Balder 's pyre .</l>
       <l n="353">Weep him all other things , if weep they will —</l>
       <l n="354">I weep him not ! let Hela keep her prey . ”</l>
       <l n="355">She spake , and to the cavern 's depth she fled ,</l>
       <l n="356">Mocking ; and Hermod knew their toil was vain .</l>
       <l n="357">And as seafaring men , who long have wrought</l>
       <l n="358">In the great deep for gain , at last come home ,</l>
       <l n="359">And towards evening see the headlands rise</l>
       <l n="360">Of their dear country , and can plain descry</l>
       <l n="361">A fire of wither 'd furze which boys have lit</l>
       <l n="362">Upon the cliffs , or smoke of burning weeds</l>
       <l n="363">Out of a till 'd field inland ;— then the wind</l>
       <l n="364">Catches them , and drives out again to sea ;</l>
       <l n="365">And they go long days tossing up and down</l>
       <l n="366">Over the grey sea-ridges , and the glimpse</l>
       <l n="367">Of port they had makes bitterer far their toil —</l>
       <l n="368">So the Gods ’ cross was bitterer for their joy .</l>
       <l n="369">Then , sad at heart , to Niord Hermod spake :—</l>
       <l n="370">“ It is the accuser Lok , who flouts us all !</l>
       <l n="371">Ride back , and tell in Heaven this heavy news ;</l>
       <l n="372">I must again below , to Hela 's realm . ”</l>
       <l n="373">He spoke ; and Niord set forth back to Heaven .</l>
       <l n="374">But northward Hermod rode , the way below ,</l>
       <l n="375">The way he knew ; and traversed Giall 's stream ,</l>
       <l n="376">And down to Ocean groped , and cross 'd the ice ,</l>
       <l n="377">And came beneath the wall , and found the grate</l>
       <l n="378">Still lifted ; well was his return foreknown .</l>
       <l n="379">And once more Hermod saw around him spread</l>
       <l n="380">The joyless plains , and heard the streams of Hell .</l>
       <l n="381">But as he enter 'd , on the extremest bound</l>
       <l n="382">Of Niflheim , he saw one ghost come near ,</l>
       <l n="383">Hovering , and stopping oft , as if afraid —</l>
       <l n="384">Hoder , the unhappy , whom his own hand slew .</l>
       <l n="385">And Hermod look 'd , and knew his brother 's ghost ,</l>
       <l n="386">And call 'd him by his name , and sternly said :—</l>
       <l n="387">“ Hoder , ill-fated , blind in heart and eyes !</l>
       <l n="388">Why tarriest thou to plunge thee in the gulph</l>
       <l n="389">Of the deep inner gloom , but flittest here ,</l>
       <l n="390">In twilight , on the lonely verge of Hell ,</l>
       <l n="391">Far from the other ghosts , and Hela 's throne ?</l>
       <l n="392">Doubtless thou fearest to meet Balder 's voice ,</l>
       <l n="393">Thy brother , whom through folly thou didst slay . ”</l>
       <l n="394">He spoke ; but Hoder answer 'd him , and said :—</l>
       <l n="395">“ Hermod the nimble , dost thou still pursue</l>
       <l n="396">The unhappy with reproach , even in the grave ?</l>
       <l n="397">For this I died , and fled beneath the gloom ,</l>
       <l n="398">Not daily to endure abhorring Gods ,</l>
       <l n="399">Nor with a hateful presence cumber Heaven ;</l>
       <l n="400">And canst thou not , even here , pass pitying by ?</l>
       <l n="401">No less than Balder have I lost the light</l>
       <l n="402">Of Heaven , and communion with my kin ;</l>
       <l n="403">I too had once a wife , and once a child ,</l>
       <l n="404">And substance , and a golden house in Heaven —</l>
       <l n="405">But all I left of my own act , and fled</l>
       <l n="406">Below , and dost thou hate me even here ?</l>
       <l n="407">Balder upbraids me not , nor hates at all ,</l>
       <l n="408">Though he has cause , have any cause ; but he ,</l>
       <l n="409">When that with downcast looks I hither came ,</l>
       <l n="410">Stretch 'd forth his hand , and with benignant voice ,</l>
       <l n="411">Welcome , he said , if there be welcome here ,</l>
       <l n="412">Brother and fellow-sport of Lok with me !</l>
       <l n="413">And not to offend thee , Hermod , nor to force</l>
       <l n="414">My hated converse on thee , came I up</l>
       <l n="415">From the deep gloom , where I will now return ;</l>
       <l n="416">But earnestly I long 'd to hover near ,</l>
       <l n="417">Not too far off , when that thou camest by ;</l>
       <l n="418">To feel the presence of a brother God ,</l>
       <l n="419">And hear the passage of a horse of Heaven ,</l>
       <l n="420">For the last time — for here thou com'st no more . ”</l>
       <l n="421">He spake , and turn 'd to go to the inner gloom .</l>
       <l n="422">But Hermod stay 'd him with mild words , and said :—</l>
       <l n="423">“ Thou doest well to chide me , Hoder blind !</l>
       <l n="424">Truly thou say'st , the planning guilty mind</l>
       <l n="425">Was Lok 's ; the unwitting hand alone was thine .</l>
       <l n="426">But Gods are like the sons of men in this —</l>
       <l n="427">When they have woe , they blame the nearest cause .</l>
       <l n="428">Howbeit stay , and be appeased ! and tell :</l>
       <l n="429">Sits Balder still in pomp by Hela 's side ,</l>
       <l n="430">Or is he mingled with the unnumber 'd dead ? ”</l>
       <l n="431">And the blind Hoder answer 'd him and spake :—</l>
       <l n="432">“ His place of state remains by Hela 's side ,</l>
       <l n="433">But empty ; for his wife , for Nanna came</l>
       <l n="434">Lately below , and join 'd him ; and the pair</l>
       <l n="435">Frequent the still recesses of the realm</l>
       <l n="436">Of Hela , and hold converse undisturb 'd .</l>
       <l n="437">But they too , doubtless , will have breathed the balm ,</l>
       <l n="438">Which floats before a visitant from Heaven ,</l>
       <l n="439">And have drawn upward to this verge of Hell . ”</l>
       <l n="440">He spake ; and , as he ceased , a puff of wind</l>
       <l n="441">Roll 'd heavily the leaden mist aside</l>
       <l n="442">Round where they stood , and they beheld two forms</l>
       <l n="443">Make toward them o'er the stretching cloudy plain .</l>
       <l n="444">And Hermod straight perceived them , who they were</l>
       <l n="445">Balder and Nanna ; and to Balder said :—</l>
       <l n="446">“ Balder , too truly thou foresaw'st a snare !</l>
       <l n="447">Lok triumphs still , and Hela keeps her prey .</l>
       <l n="448">No more to Asgard shalt thou come , nor lodge</l>
       <l n="449">In thy own house , Breidablik , nor enjoy</l>
       <l n="450">The love all bear toward thee , nor train up</l>
       <l n="451">Forset , thy son , to be beloved like thee .</l>
       <l n="452">Here must thou lie , and wait an endless age .</l>
       <l n="453">Therefore for the last time , O Balder , hail ! ”</l>
       <l n="454">He spake ; and Balder answer 'd him , and said :—</l>
       <l n="455">“ Hail and farewell ! for here thou com'st no more .</l>
       <l n="456">Yet mourn not for me , Hermod , when thou sitt'st</l>
       <l n="457">In Heaven , nor let the other Gods lament ,</l>
       <l n="458">As wholly to be pitied , quite forlorn .</l>
       <l n="459">For Nanna hath rejoin 'd me , who , of old ,</l>
       <l n="460">In Heaven , was seldom parted from my side ;</l>
       <l n="461">And still the acceptance follows me , which crown 'd</l>
       <l n="462">My former life , and cheers me even here .</l>
       <l n="463">The iron frown of Hela is relax 'd</l>
       <l n="464">When I draw nigh , and the wan tribes of dead</l>
       <l n="465">Love me , and gladly bring for my award</l>
       <l n="466">Their ineffectual feuds and feeble hates —</l>
       <l n="467">Shadows of hates , but they distress them still . ”</l>
       <l n="468">And the fleet-footed Hermod made reply :—</l>
       <l n="469">“ Thou hast then all the solace death allows ,</l>
       <l n="470">Esteem and function ; and so far is well .</l>
       <l n="471">Yet here thou liest , Balder , underground ,</l>
       <l n="472">Rusting for ever ; and the years roll on ,</l>
       <l n="473">The generations pass , the ages grow ,</l>
       <l n="474">And bring us nearer to the final day</l>
       <l n="475">When from the south shall march the fiery band</l>
       <l n="476">And cross the bridge of Heaven , with Lok for guide ,</l>
       <l n="477">And Fenris at his heel with broken chain ;</l>
       <l n="478">While from the east the giant Rymer steers</l>
       <l n="479">His ship , and the great serpent makes to land ;</l>
       <l n="480">And all are marshall 'd in one flaming square</l>
       <l n="481">Against the Gods , upon the plains of Heaven ,</l>
       <l n="482">I mourn thee , that thou canst not help us then . ”</l>
       <l n="483">He spake ; but Balder answer 'd him , and said :—</l>
       <l n="484">“ Mourn not for me ! Mourn , Hermod , for the Gods ;</l>
       <l n="485">Mourn for the men on earth , the Gods in Heaven ,</l>
       <l n="486">Who live , and with their eyes shall see that day !</l>
       <l n="487">The day will come , when fall shall Asgard 's towers ,</l>
       <l n="488">And Odin , and his sons , the seed of Heaven ;</l>
       <l n="489">But what were I , to save them in that hour ?</l>
       <l n="490">If strength might save them , could not Odin save ,</l>
       <l n="491">My father , and his pride , the warrior Thor ,</l>
       <l n="492">Vidar the silent , the impetuous Tyr ?</l>
       <l n="493">I , what were I , when these can nought avail ?</l>
       <l n="494">Yet , doubtless , when the day of battle comes ,</l>
       <l n="495">And the two hosts are marshall 'd , and in Heaven</l>
       <l n="496">The golden-crested cock shall sound alarm ,</l>
       <l n="497">And his black brother-bird from hence reply ,</l>
       <l n="498">And bucklers clash , and spears begin to pour —</l>
       <l n="499">Longing will stir within my breast , though vain .</l>
       <l n="500">But not to me so grievous , as , I know ,</l>
       <l n="501">To other Gods it were , is my enforced</l>
       <l n="502">Absence from fields where I could nothing aid ;</l>
       <l n="503">For I am long since weary of your storm</l>
       <l n="504">Of carnage , and find , Hermod , in your life</l>
       <l n="505">Something too much of war and broils , which make</l>
       <l n="506">Life one perpetual fight , a bath of blood .</l>
       <l n="507">Mine eyes are dizzy with the arrowy hail ;</l>
       <l n="508">Mine ears are stunn 'd with blows , and sick for calm .</l>
       <l n="509">Inactive therefore let me lie , in gloom ,</l>
       <l n="510">Unarm 'd , inglorious ; I attend the course</l>
       <l n="511">Of ages , and my late return to light ,</l>
       <l n="512">In times less alien to a spirit mild ,</l>
       <l n="513">In new-recover 'd seats , the happier day . ”</l>
       <l n="514">He spake ; and the fleet Hermod thus replied :—</l>
       <l n="515">“ Brother , what seats are these , what happier day ?</l>
       <l n="516">Tell me , that I may ponder it when gone . ”</l>
       <l n="517">And the ray-crowned Balder answer 'd him :—</l>
       <l n="518">“ Far to the south , beyond the blue , there spreads</l>
       <l n="519">Another Heaven , the boundless — no one yet</l>
       <l n="520">Hath reach 'd it ; there hereafter shall arise</l>
       <l n="521">The second Asgard , with another name .</l>
       <l n="522">Thither , when o'er this present earth and Heavens</l>
       <l n="523">The tempest of the latter days hath swept ,</l>
       <l n="524">And they from sight have disappear 'd , and sunk ,</l>
       <l n="525">Shall a small remnant of the Gods repair ;</l>
       <l n="526">Hoder and I shall join them from the grave .</l>
       <l n="527">There re-assembling we shall see emerge</l>
       <l n="528">From the bright Ocean at our feet an earth</l>
       <l n="529">More fresh , more verdant than the last , with fruits</l>
       <l n="530">Self-springing , and a seed of man preserved ,</l>
       <l n="531">Who then shall live in peace , as now in war .</l>
       <l n="532">But we in Heaven shall find again with joy</l>
       <l n="533">The ruin 'd palaces of Odin , seats</l>
       <l n="534">Familiar , halls where we have supp 'd of old ;</l>
       <l n="535">Re-enter them with wonder , never fill</l>
       <l n="536">Our eyes with gazing , and rebuild with tears .</l>
       <l n="537">And we shall tread once more the well-known plain</l>
       <l n="538">Of Ida , and among the grass shall find</l>
       <l n="539">The golden dice wherewith we play 'd of yore ;</l>
       <l n="540">And that will bring to mind the former life</l>
       <l n="541">And pastime of the Gods , the wise discourse</l>
       <l n="542">Of Odin , the delights of other days ,</l>
       <l n="543">O Hermod , pray that thou may'st join us then !</l>
       <l n="544">Such for the future is my hope ; meanwhile ,</l>
       <l n="545">I rest the thrall of Hela , and endure</l>
       <l n="546">Death , and the gloom which round me even now</l>
       <l n="547">Thickens , and to its inner gulph recalls .</l>
       <l n="548">Farewell , for longer speech is not allow 'd ! ”</l>
       <l n="549">He spoke , and waved farewell , and gave his hand</l>
       <l n="550">To Nanna ; and she gave their brother blind</l>
       <l n="551">Her hand , in turn , for guidance ; and the three</l>
       <l n="552">Departed o'er the cloudy plain , and soon</l>
       <l n="553">Faded from sight into the interior gloom .</l>
       <l n="554">But Hermod stood beside his drooping horse ,</l>
       <l n="555">Mute , gazing after them in tears ; and fain ,</l>
       <l n="556">Fain had he follow 'd their receding steps ,</l>
       <l n="557">Though they to death were bound , and he to Heaven ,</l>
       <l n="558">Then ; but a power he could not break withheld .</l>
       <l n="559">And as a stork which idle boys have trapp 'd ,</l>
       <l n="560">And tied him in a yard , at autumn sees</l>
       <l n="561">Flocks of his kind pass flying o'er his head</l>
       <l n="562">To warmer lands , and coasts that keep the sun ;—</l>
       <l n="563">He strains to join their flight , and from his shed</l>
       <l n="564">Follows them with a long complaining cry —</l>
       <l n="565">So Hermod gazed , and yearn 'd to join his kin .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="566">At last he sigh 'd , and set forth back to Heaven .</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="19">
        <l n="131">A year had flown , and o'er the sea away ,</l>
        <l n="132">In Cornwall , Tristram and Queen Iseult lay ;</l>
        <l n="133">In King Marc 's chapel , in Tyntagel old —</l>
        <l n="134">There in a ship they bore those lovers cold .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="20">
        <l n="135">The young surviving Iseult , one bright day ,</l>
        <l n="136">Had wander 'd forth . Her children were at play</l>
        <l n="137">In a green circular hollow in the heath</l>
        <l n="138">Which borders the sea-shore — a country path</l>
        <l n="139">Creeps over it from the till 'd fields behind .</l>
        <l n="140">The hollow 's grassy banks are soft-inclined ,</l>
        <l n="141">And to one standing on them , far and near</l>
        <l n="142">The lone unbroken view spreads bright and clear</l>
        <l n="143">Over the waste . This cirque of open ground</l>
        <l n="144">Is light and green ; the heather , which all round</l>
        <l n="145">Creeps thickly , grows not here ; but the pale grass</l>
        <l n="146">Is strewn with rocks , and many a shiver 'd mass</l>
        <l n="147">Of vein 'd white-gleaming quartz , and here and there</l>
        <l n="148">Dotted with holly-trees and juniper .</l>
        <l n="149">In the smooth centre of the opening stood</l>
        <l n="150">Three hollies side by side , and made a screen ,</l>
        <l n="151">Warm with the winter-sun , of burnish 'd green</l>
        <l n="152">With scarlet berries gemm 'd , the fell-fare 's food .</l>
        <l n="153">Under the glittering hollies Iseult stands ,</l>
        <l n="154">Watching her children play ; their little hands</l>
        <l n="155">Are busy gathering spars of quartz , and streams</l>
        <l n="156">Of stagshorn for their hats ; anon , with screams</l>
        <l n="157">Of mad delight they drop their spoils , and bound</l>
        <l n="158">Among the holly-clumps and broken ground ,</l>
        <l n="159">Racing full speed , and startling in their rush</l>
        <l n="160">The fell-fares and the speckled missel-thrush</l>
        <l n="161">Out of their glossy coverts ;— but when now</l>
        <l n="162">Their cheeks were flush 'd , and over each hot brow ,</l>
        <l n="163">Under the feather 'd hats of the sweet pair ,</l>
        <l n="164">In blinding masses shower 'd the golden hair —</l>
        <l n="165">Then Iseult call 'd them to her , and the three</l>
        <l n="166">Cluster 'd under the holly-screen , and she</l>
        <l n="167">Told them an old-world Breton history .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="21">
        <l n="168">Warm in their mantles wrapt the three stood there ,</l>
        <l n="169">Under the hollies , in the clear still air —</l>
        <l n="170">Mantles with those rich furs deep glistering</l>
        <l n="171">Which Venice ships do from swart Egypt bring .</l>
        <l n="172">Long they stay 'd still — then , pacing at their ease ,</l>
        <l n="173">Moved up and down under the glossy trees .</l>
        <l n="174">But still , as they pursued their warm dry road ,</l>
        <l n="175">From Iseult 's lips the unbroken story flow 'd ,</l>
        <l n="176">And still the children listen 'd , their blue eyes</l>
        <l n="177">Fix 'd on their mother 's face in wide surprise ;</l>
        <l n="178">Nor did their looks stray once to the sea-side ,</l>
        <l n="179">Nor to the brown heaths round them , bright and wide ,</l>
        <l n="180">Nor to the snow , which , though ‘ t was all away</l>
        <l n="181">From the open heath , still by the hedgerows lay ,</l>
        <l n="182">Nor to the shining sea-fowl , that with screams</l>
        <l n="183">Bore up from where the bright Atlantic gleams ,</l>
        <l n="184">Swooping to landward ; nor to where , quite clear ,</l>
        <l n="185">The fell-fares settled on the thickets near .</l>
        <l n="186">And they would still have listen 'd , till dark night</l>
        <l n="187">Came keen and chill down on the heather bright ;</l>
        <l n="188">But , when the red glow on the sea grew cold ,</l>
        <l n="189">And the grey turrets of the castle old</l>
        <l n="190">Look 'd sternly through the frosty evening-air ,</l>
        <l n="191">Then Iseult took by the hand those children fair ,</l>
        <l n="192">And brought her tale to an end , and found the path ,</l>
        <l n="193">And led them home over the darkening heath .</l>
       </lg>
       <lg type="stanza" n="22">
        <l n="194">And is she happy ? Does she see unmoved</l>
        <l n="195">The days in which she might have lived and loved</l>
        <l n="196">Slip without bringing bliss slowly away ,</l>
        <l n="197">One after one , to-morrow like to-day ?</l>
        <l n="198">Joy has not found her yet , nor ever will —</l>
        <l n="199">Is it this thought which makes her mien so still ,</l>
        <l n="200">Her features so fatigued , her eyes , though sweet ,</l>
        <l n="201">So sunk , so rarely lifted save to meet</l>
        <l n="202">Her children 's ? She moves slow ; her voice alone</l>
        <l n="203">Hath yet an infantine and silver tone ,</l>
        <l n="204">But even that comes languidly ; in truth ,</l>
        <l n="205">She seems one dying in a mask of youth .</l>
        <l n="206">And now she will go home , and softly lay</l>
        <l n="207">Her laughing children in their beds , and play</l>
        <l n="208">Awhile with them before they sleep ; and then</l>
        <l n="209">She 'll light her silver lamp , which fishermen</l>
        <l n="210">Dragging their nets through the rough waves , afar ,</l>
        <l n="211">Along this iron coast , know like a star ,</l>
        <l n="212">And take her broidery-frame , and there she 'll sit</l>
        <l n="213">Hour after hour , her gold curls sweeping it ;</l>
        <l n="214">Lifting her soft-bent head only to mind</l>
        <l n="215">Her children , or to listen to the wind .</l>
        <l n="216">And when the clock peals midnight , she will move</l>
        <l n="217">Her work away , and let her fingers rove</l>
        <l n="218">Across the shaggy brows of Tristram 's hound</l>
        <l n="219">Who lies , guarding her feet , along the ground ;</l>
        <l n="220">Or else she will fall musing , her blue eyes</l>
        <l n="221">Fixt , her slight hands clasp 'd on her lap ; then rise ,</l>
        <l n="222">And at her prie-dieu kneel , until she have told</l>
        <l n="223">Her rosary-beads of ebony tipp 'd with gold ,</l>
        <l n="224">Then to her soft sleep — and to-morrow ‘ ll be</l>

       <lg type="stanza" n="23">
        <l n="226">Yes , it is lonely for her in her hall .</l>
        <l n="227">The children , and the grey-hair 'd seneschal ,</l>
        <l n="228">Her women , and Sir Tristram 's aged hound ,</l>

     <p>DRAMATIC POEMS</p>
     <p>MEROPE</p>
     <p>A TRAGEDY</p>
     <p>STORY OF THE DRAMA</p>
     <p>Apollodorus says :— “ Cresphontes had not reigned long in Messenia when he was murdered , together with two of his sons . And Polyphontes reigned in his stead , he , too , being of the family of Hercules ; and he had for his wife , against her will , Merope , the widow of the murdered king . But Merope had borne to Cresphontes a third son , called Æpytus ; him she gave to her own father to bring up . He , when he came to man 's estate , returned secretly to Messenia , and slew Polyphontes and the other murderers of his father . ”</p>
     <p>Hyginus says :— “ Merope sent away and concealed her infant son . Polyphontes sought for him everywhere in vain . He , when he grew up , laid a plan to avenge the murder of his father and brothers . In pursuance of this plan he came to king Polyphontes and reported the death of the son of Cresphontes and Merope . The king ordered him to be hospitably entertained , intending to inquire further of him . He , being very tired , went to sleep , and an old man , who was the channel through whom the mother and son used to communicate , arrives at this moment in tears , bringing word to Merope that her son had disappeared from his protector 's house , and was slain . Merope , believing that the sleeping stranger is the murderer of her son , comes into the guest-chamber with an axe , not knowing that he whom she would slay was her son ; the old man recognised him , and withheld Merope from slaying him . The king , Polyphontes , rejoicing at the supposed death of Æpytus , celebrated a sacrifice ; his guest , pretending to strike the sacrificial victim , slew the king , and so got back his father 's kingdom . ”</p>
     <p>The events on which the action of the drama turns belong to the period of transition from the heroic and fabulous to the human and historic age of Greece . The doings of the hero Hercules , the ancestor of the Messenian Æpytus , belong to fable ; but the invasion of Peloponnesus by the Dorians under chiefs claiming to be descended from Hercules , and their settlement in Argos , Lacedæmon , and Messenia , belong to history . Æpytus is descended on the father 's side from Hercules , Perseus , and the kings of Argos ; on the mother 's side from Pelasgus , and the aboriginal kings of Arcadia . Callisto , the daughter of the wicked Lycaon , and the mother , by Zeus , of Arcas , from whom the Arcadians took their name , was the granddaughter of Pelasgus . The birth of Arcas brought upon Callisto the anger of the virgin-goddess Artemis , whose service she followed : she was changed into a she-bear , and in this form was chased by her own son , grown to manhood . Zeus interposed , and the mother and son were removed from the earth , and placed among the stars . Callisto became the famous constellation of the Great Bear ; her son became Arcturus , Arctophylax , or Boötes . From this son of Callisto were descended Cypselus , the maternal grandfather of Æpytus , and the children of Cypselus , Laias and Merope .</p>
     <p>The story of the life of Hercules , the paternal ancestor of Æpytus , is so well known that there is no need to record it . The reader will remember that , although entitled to the throne of Argos by right of descent from Perseus and Danaus , and to the thrones of Sparta and Messenia by right of conquest , Hercules yet passed his life in labours and wanderings , subjected by the decree of fate to the commands of his kinsman , the feeble and malignant Eurystheus . At his death he bequeathed to his offspring , the Heracleidæ , his own claims to the kingdoms of Peloponnesus , and to the persecution of Eurystheus . They at first sought shelter with Ceyx , king of Trachis ; he was too weak to protect them , and they then took refuge at Athens . The Athenians refused to deliver them up at the demand of Eurystheus ; he invaded Attica , and a battle was fought near Marathon , in which , after Macaria , a daughter of Hercules , had devoted herself for the preservation of her house , Eurystheus fell , and the Heracleidæ and their Athenian protectors were victorious . The memory of Macaria 's self-sacrifices was perpetuated by the name of a spring of water on the plain of Marathon , the spring Macaria . The Heracleidæ then endeavoured to effect their return to Peloponnesus . Hyllus , the eldest of them , inquired of the oracle at Delphi respecting their return ; he was told to return by the narrow passage and in the third harvest . Accordingly , in the third year from that time Hyllus led an army to the Isthmus of Corinth ; but there he was encountered by an army of Achaians and Arcadians , and fell in single combat with Echemus , king of Tegea . Upon this defeat the Heracleidæ retired to northern Greece ; there , after much wandering , they finally took refuge with Ægimius , king of the Dorians , who appears to have been the fastest friend of their house , and whose Dorian warriors formed the army which at last achieved their return . But , for a hundred years from the date of their first attempt , the Heracleidæ were defeated in their successive invasions of Peloponnesus . Cleolaus and Aristomachus , the son and grandson of Hyllus , fell in unsuccessful expeditions . At length the sons of Aristomachus , Temenus , Cresphontes , and Aristodemus , when grown up , repaired to Delphi and taxed the oracle with the non-fulfilment of the promise made to their ancestor Hyllus . But Apollo replied that his oracle had been misunderstood ; for that by the third harvest he had meant the third generation , and by the narrow passage he had meant the straits of the Corinthian Gulf . After this explanation the sons of Aristomachus built a fleet at Naupactus ; and finally , in the hundredth year from the death of Hyllus and the eightieth from the fall of Troy , the invasion was again attempted and was this time successful . The son of Orestes , Tisamenus , who ruled both Argos and Lacedæmon , fell in battle ; many of his vanquished subjects left their homes and took refuge in Achaia .</p>
     <p>The spoil was now to be divided among the conquerors . Aristodemus , the youngest of the sons of Aristomachus , did not survive to enjoy his share . He was slain at Delphi by the sons of Pylades and Electra , the kinsman , through their mother , of the house of Agamemnon , that house which the Heracleidæ with their Dorian army had dispossessed . The claims of Aristodemus descended to his two sons , Procles and Eurysthenes , children under the guardianship of their maternal uncle , Theras . Temenus , the eldest of the sons of Aristomachus , took the kingdom of Argos . For the two remaining kingdoms , that of Sparta and that of Messenia , his two nephews , who were to rule jointly , and their uncle Cresphontes , had to cast lots . Cresphontes wished to have the fertile Messenia , and induced his brother to acquiesce in a trick which secured it to him . The lot of Cresphontes and that of his two nephews were to be placed in a water-jar , and thrown out . Messenia was to belong to him whose lot came out first . With the connivance of Temenus , Cresphontes marked as his own lot a pellet composed of baked clay , as the lot of his nephews , a pellet of unbaked clay ; the unbaked pellet was of course dissolved in the water , while the brick pellet fell out alone . Messenia , therefore , was assigned to Cresphontes .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Messenia was at this time ruled by Melanthus , a descendant of Neleus .</l>
       <l n="2">This ancestor , a prince of the great house of Æolus , had come from</l>
       <l n="3">Thessaly and succeeded to the Messenian throne on the failure of the</l>
       <l n="4">previous dynasty . Melanthus and his race were thus foreigners in</l>
       <l n="5">Messenia and were unpopular . His subjects offered little or no</l>
       <l n="6">opposition to the invading Dorians ; Melanthus abandoned his kingdom to</l>
       <l n="7">Cresphontes , and retired to Athens .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Cresphontes married Merope , whose native country , Arcadia , was not affected by the Dorian invasion . This marriage , the issue of which was three sons , connected him with the native population of Peloponnesus . He built a new capital of Messenia , Stenyclaros , and transferred thither , from Pylos , the seat of government ; he proposed , moreover , says Pausanias , to divide Messenia into five states , and to confer on the native Messenians equal privileges with their Dorian conquerors . The Dorians complained that his administration unduly favoured the vanquished people ; his chief magnates , headed by Polyphontes , himself a descendant of Hercules , formed a cabal against him , and he was slain with his two eldest sons . The youngest son of Cresphontes , Æpytus , then an infant , was saved by his mother , who sent him to her father , Cypselus , the king of Arcadia , under whose protection he was brought up .</p>
     <p>The drama begins at the moment when Æpytus , grown to manhood , returns secretly to Messenia to take vengeance on his father 's murderers . At this period Temenus was no longer reigning at Argos ; he had been murdered by his sons , jealous of their brother-in-law , Deiphontes . The sons of Aristodemus , Procles and Eurysthenes , at variance with their uncle and ex-guardian , Theras , were reigning at Sparta .</p>

       <l n="423">There , with the chief of that hill-town , we lodged</l>
       <l n="424">One night ; and the next day at dawn fared on</l>
       <l n="425">By the Three Fountains and the Adder 's Hill</l>
       <l n="426">To the Stymphalian Lake , our journey 's end ,</l>
       <l n="427">To draw the coverts on Cyllenê 's side .</l>
       <l n="428">There , on a high green spur which bathes its point</l>

       <l n="430">Cates from our hunters ’ pouch , Arcadian fare ,</l>
       <l n="431">Sweet chestnuts , barley-cakes , and boar'shYpppHeNflesh dried ;</l>

       <l n="455">Was blinded by the outgushing springs of brine .</l>
       <l n="456">Then , turning westward to the Adder 's Hill —</l>
       <l n="457">Another ancestor , named , too , like me ,</l>
       <l n="458">Died of a snake-bite , said he , on that brow ;</l>

       <l n="460">Where , as life ebb 'd , his bearers laid him down .</l>

       <l n="462">This region is not happy for my race .</l>
       <l n="463">We cheer 'd him ; but , that moment , from the copse</l>
       <l n="464">By the lake-edge , broke the sharp cry of hounds ;</l>
       <l n="465">The prickers shouted that the stag was gone .</l>
       <l n="466">We sprang upon our feet , we snatch 'd our spears ,</l>
       <l n="467">We bounded down the swarded slope , we plunged</l>
       <l n="468">Through the dense ilex-thickets to the dogs .</l>
       <l n="469">Far in the woods ahead their music rang ;</l>
       <l n="470">And many times that morn we coursed in ring</l>
       <l n="471">The forests round that belt Cyllenê 's side ;</l>
       <l n="472">Till I , thrown out and tired , came to halt</l>
       <l n="473">On that same spur where we had sate at morn .</l>
       <l n="474">And resting there to breathe , I watch 'd the chase —</l>
       <l n="475">Rare , straggling hunters , foil 'd by brake and crag ,</l>
       <l n="476">And the prince , single , pressing on the rear</l>
       <l n="477">Of that unflagging quarry and the hounds .</l>
       <l n="478">Now in the woods far down I saw them cross</l>
       <l n="479">An open glade ; now he was high aloft</l>
       <l n="480">On some tall scar fringed with dark feathery pines ,</l>
       <l n="481">Peering to spy a goat-track down the cliff ,</l>
       <l n="482">Cheering with hand , and voice , and horn his dogs .</l>
       <l n="483">At last the cry drew to the water 's edge —</l>
       <l n="484">And through the brushwood , to the pebbly strand ,</l>
       <l n="485">Broke , black with sweat , the antler 'd mountain-stag ,</l>
       <l n="486">And took the lake . Two hounds alone pursued ,</l>
       <l n="487">Then came the prince ; he shouted and plunged in .</l>
       <l n="488">— There is a chasm rifted in the base</l>
       <l n="489">Of that unfooted precipice , whose rock</l>
       <l n="490">Walls on one side the deep Stymphalian Lake ;</l>
       <l n="491">There the lake-waters , which in ages gone</l>
       <l n="492">Wash 'd , as the marks upon the hills still show ,</l>
       <l n="493">All the Stymphalian plain , are now suck 'd down .</l>
       <l n="494">A headland , with one aged plane-tree crown 'd ,</l>
       <l n="495">Parts from this cave-pierced cliff the shelving bay</l>
       <l n="496">Where first the chase plunged in ; the bay is smooth ,</l>
       <l n="497">But round the headland 's point a current sets ,</l>
       <l n="498">Strong , black , tempestuous , to the cavern-mouth .</l>
       <l n="499">Stoutly , under the headland 's lee , they swam ;</l>
       <l n="500">But when they came abreast the point , the race</l>
       <l n="501">Caught them as wind takes feathers , whirl 'd them round</l>
       <l n="502">Struggling in vain to cross it , swept them on ,</l>
       <l n="503">Stag , dogs , and hunter , to the yawning gulph .</l>
       <l n="504">All this , O King , not piecemeal , as to thee</l>
       <l n="505">Now told , but in one flashing instant pass 'd .</l>
       <l n="506">While from the turf whereon I lay I sprang</l>
       <l n="507">And took three strides , quarry and dogs were gone ;</l>
       <l n="508">A moment more — I saw the prince turn round</l>
       <l n="509">Once in the black and arrowy race , and cast</l>
       <l n="510">An arm aloft for help ; then sweep beneath</l>
       <l n="511">The low-brow 'd cavern-arch , and disappear .</l>
       <l n="512">And what I could , I did — to call by cries</l>
       <l n="513">Some straggling hunters to my aid , to rouse</l>
       <l n="514">Fishers who live on the lake-side , to launch</l>
       <l n="515">Boats , and approach , near as we dared , the chasm .</l>
       <l n="516">But of the prince nothing remain 'd , save this ,</l>
       <l n="517">His boar-spear 's broken shaft , back on the lake</l>
       <l n="518">Cast by the rumbling subterranean stream ;</l>
       <l n="519">And this , at landing spied by us and saved ,</l>
       <l n="520">His broad-brimm 'd hunter 's hat , which , in the bay ,</l>
       <l n="521">Where first the stag took water , floated still .</l>
       <l n="522">And I across the mountains brought with haste</l>

    <p n="3">The name Europe ([ Greek : Eurôpê ] , the wide prospect ) probably describes the appearance of the European coast to the Greeks on the coast of Asia Minor opposite . The name Asia , again , comes , it has been thought , from the muddy fens of the rivers of Asia Minor , such as the Cayster or Mæander , which struck the imagination of the Greeks living near them . ]</p>

    <p n="12">Sohrab and Rustum .</p>
    <p n="13">The story of Sohrab and Rustum is told in Sir John Malcolm 's History of Persia , as follows :—</p>
    <p n="14">“ The young Sohrab was the fruit of one of Rustum 's early amours . He had left his mother , and sought fame under the banners of Afrasiab , whose armies he commanded , and soon obtained a renown beyond that of all contemporary heroes but his father . He had carried death and dismay into the ranks of the Persians , and had terrified the boldest warriors of that country , before Rustum encountered him , which at last that hero resolved to do , under a feigned name . They met three times . The first time they parted by mutual consent , though Sohrab had the advantage ; the second , the youth obtained a victory , but granted life to his unknown father ; the third was fatal to Sohrab , who , when writhing in the pangs of death , warned his conqueror to shun the vengeance that is inspired by parental woes , and bade him dread the rage of the mighty Rustum , who must soon learn that he had slain his son Sohrab . These words , we are told , were as death to the aged hero ; and when he recovered from a trance , he called in despair for proofs of what Sohrab had said . The afflicted and dying youth tore open his mail , and showed his father a seal which his mother had placed on his arm when she discovered to him the secret of his birth , and bade him seek his father . The sight of his own signet rendered Rustum quite frantic ; he cursed himself , attempting to put an end to his existence , and was only prevented by the efforts of his expiring son . After Sohrab 's death , he burnt his tents and all his goods , and carried the corpse to Seistan , where it was interred ; the army of Turan was , agreeably to the last request of Sohrab , permitted to cross the Oxus unmolested . To reconcile us to the improbability of this tale , we are informed that Rustum could have no idea his son was in existence . The mother of Sohrab had written to him her child was a daughter , fearing to lose her darling infant if she revealed the truth ; and Rustum , as before stated , fought under a feigned name , an usage not uncommon in the chivalrous combats of those days . ” ]</p>

    <p n="15">Balder Dead .</p>
    <p n="16">“ Balder the Good having been tormented with terrible dreams , indicating that his life was in great peril , communicated them to the assembled Æsir , who resolved to conjure all things to avert from him the threatened danger . Then Frigga exacted an oath from fire and water , from iron , and all other metals , as well as from stones , earths , diseases , beasts , birds , poisons , and creeping things , that none of them would do any harm to Balder . When this was done , it became a favourite pastime of the Æsir , at their meetings , to get Balder to stand up and serve them as a mark , some hurling darts at him , some stones , while others hewed at him with their swords and battle-axes , for do what they would , none of them could harm him , and this was regarded by all as a great honour shown to Balder . But when Loki beheld the scene he was sorely vexed that Balder was not hurt . Assuming , therefore , the shape of a woman , he went to Fensalir , the mansion of Frigga . That goddess , when she saw the pretended woman , inquired of her if she knew what the Æsir were doing at their meetings . She replied , that they were throwing darts and stones at Balder without being able to hurt him .</p>
    <p n="17">“ ‘ Ay , ’ said Frigga , ‘ neither metal nor wood can hurt Balder , for I have exacted an oath from all of them . ’</p>
    <p n="18">“ ‘ What ! ’ exclaimed the woman , ‘ have all things sworn to spare Balder ? ’</p>
    <p n="19">“ ‘ All things , ’ replied Frigga , ‘ except one little shrub that grows on the eastern side of Valhalla , and is called Mistletoe , and which I thought too young and feeble to crave an oath from . ’</p>
    <p n="20">“ As soon as Loki heard this he went away , and , resuming his natural shape , cut off the mistletoe , and repaired to the place where the gods were assembled . There he found Hödur standing apart , without partaking of the sports , on account of his blindness , and going up to him said , ‘ Why dost thou not also throw something at Balder ? ’</p>
    <p n="21">“ ‘ Because I am blind , ’ answered Hödur , ‘ and see not where Balder is , and have , moreover , nothing to throw with . ’</p>
    <p n="22">“ ‘ Come , then , ’ said Loki , ‘ do like the rest , and show honour to Balder by throwing this twig at him , and I will direct thy arm toward the place where he stands . ’</p>
    <p n="23">“ Hödur then took the mistletoe , and , under the guidance of Loki , darted it at Balder , who , pierced through and through , fell down lifeless . ” — Edda . ]</p>

    <p n="24">Tristram and Iseult .</p>
    <p n="25">“ In the court of his uncle King Marc , the king of Cornwall , who at this time resided at the castle of Tyntagel , Tristram became expert in all knightly exercises .— The king of Ireland , at Tristram 's solicitations , promised to bestow his daughter Iseult in marriage on King Marc . The mother of Iseult gave to her daughter 's confidante a philtre , or love-potion , to be administered on the night of her nuptials . Of this beverage Tristram and Iseult , on their voyage to Cornwall , unfortunately partook . Its influence , during the remainder of their lives , regulated the affections and destiny of the lovers .—</p>
    <p n="26">“ After the arrival of Tristram and Iseult in Cornwall , and the nuptials of the latter with King Marc , a great part of the romance is occupied with their contrivances to procure secret interviews .— Tristram , being forced to leave Cornwall , on account of the displeasure of his uncle , repaired to Brittany , where lived Iseult with the White Hands .— He married her — more out of gratitude than love .— Afterwards he proceeded to the dominions of Arthur , which became the theatre of unnumbered exploits .</p>
    <p n="27">“ Tristram , subsequent to these events , returned to Brittany , and to his long-neglected wife . There , being wounded and sick , he was soon reduced to the lowest ebb . In this situation , he despatched a confidant to the queen of Cornwall , to try if he could induce her to follow him to Brittany , etc . ” — DUNLOP 'S History of Fiction . ]</p>

    <p n="42">The Scholar-Gipsy .</p>
    <p n="43">“ There was very lately a lad in the University of Oxford , who was by his poverty forced to leave his studies there ; and at last to join himself to a company of vagabond gipsies . Among these extravagant people , by the insinuating subtilty of his carriage , he quickly got so much of their love and esteem as that they discovered to him their mystery . After he had been a pretty while exercised in the trade , there chanced to ride by a couple of scholars , who had formerly been of his acquaintance . They quickly spied out their old friend among the gipsies ; and he gave them an account of the necessity which drove him to that kind of life , and told them that the people he went with were not such impostors as they were taken for , but that they had a traditional kind of learning among them , and could do wonders by the power of imagination , their fancy binding that of others : that himself had learned much of their art , and when he had compassed the whole secret , he intended , he said , to leave their company , and give the world an account of what he had learned . ” — GLANVIL 'S Vanity of Dogmatizing , 1661 . ]</p>

    <p n="46">Young Daphnis with his silver voice doth sing .</p>
    <p n="47">Daphnis , the ideal Sicilian shepherd of Greek pastoral poetry , was said to have followed into Phrygia his mistress Piplea , who had been carried off by robbers , and to have found her in the power of the king of Phrygia , Lityerses . Lityerses used to make strangers try a contest with him in reaping corn , and to put them to death if he overcame them . Hercules arrived in time to save Daphnis , took upon himself the reaping-contest with Lityerses , overcame him , and slew him . The Lityerses-song connected with this tradition was , like the Linus-song , one of the early plaintive strains of Greek popular poetry , and used to be sung by corn-reapers . Other traditions represented Daphnis as beloved by a nymph who exacted from him an oath to love no one else . He fell in love with a princess , and was struck blind by the jealous nymph . Mercury , who was his father , raised him to Heaven , and made a fountain spring up in the place from which he ascended . At this fountain the Sicilians offered yearly sacrifices .— See Servius , Comment . in Virgil . Bucol ., v. 20 , and viii . 68 . ]</p>

    <p n="60">The author of Obermann , Étienne Pivert de Senancour , has little celebrity in France , his own country ; and out of France he is almost unknown . But the profound inwardness , the austere sincerity , of his principal work , Obermann , the delicate feeling for nature which it exhibits , and the melancholy eloquence of many passages of it , have attracted and charmed some of the most remarkable spirits of this century , such as George Sand and Sainte-Beuve , and will probably always find a certain number of spirits whom they touch and interest .</p>
    <p n="61">Senancour was born in 1770 . He was educated for the priesthood , and passed some time in the seminary of St. Sulpice ; broke away from the Seminary and from France itself , and passed some years in Switzerland , where he married ; returned to France in middle life , and followed thenceforward the career of a man of letters , but with hardly any fame or success . He died an old man in 1846 , desiring that on his grave might be placed these words only : Éternité , deviens mon asile !</p>
    <p n="62">The influence of Rousseau , and certain affinities with more famous and fortunate authors of his own day ,— Chateaubriand and Madame de Staël ,— are everywhere visible in Senancour . But though , like these eminent personages , he may be called a sentimental writer , and though Obermann , a collection of letters from Switzerland treating almost entirely of nature and of the human soul , may be called a work of sentiment , Senancour has a gravity and severity which distinguish him from all other writers of the sentimental school . The world is with him in his solitude far less than it is with them ; of all writers he is the most perfectly isolated and the least attitudinising . His chief work , too , has a value and power of its own , apart from these merits of its author . The stir of all the main forces , by which modern life is and has been impelled , lives in the letters of Obermann ; the dissolving agencies of the eighteenth century , the fiery storm of the French Revolution , the first faint promise and dawn of that new world which our own time is but now more fully bringing to light ,— all these are to be felt , almost to be touched , there . To me , indeed , it will always seem that the impressiveness of this production can hardly be rated too high .</p>
    <p n="63">Besides Obermann there is one other of Senancour 's works which , for those spirits who feel his attraction , is very interesting ; its title is , Libres Méditations d'un Solitaire Inconnu . ]</p>

    <p n="82">“ The church had been prepared against the next day for dedication . On the night preceding , St. Peter appeared on the opposite side of the water to a fisherman , desiring to be conveyed to the farther shore . Having left the boat , St. Peter ordered the fisherman to wait , promising him a reward on his return . An innumerable host from heaven accompanied the apostle , singing choral hymns , while everything was illuminated with a supernatural light . The dedication having been completed , St. Peter returned to the fisherman , quieted his alarm at what had passed , and announced himself as the apostle . He directed the fisherman to go as soon as it was day to the authorities , to state what he had seen and heard , and to inform them that , in corroboration of his testimony , they would find the marks of consecration on the walls of the church . In obedience to the apostle 's direction , the fisherman waited on Mellitus , Bishop of London , who , going to the church , found not only marks of the chrism , but of the tapers with which the church had been illuminated . Mellitus , therefore , desisted from proceeding to a new consecration , and contented himself with the celebration of the mass . ” — DUGDALE , Monasticon Anglicanum ( edition of 1817 ) , vol . i. pp . 265 , 266 .
