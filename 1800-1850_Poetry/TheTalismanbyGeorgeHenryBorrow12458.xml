       <l n="5">His days and nights , secluded , spent ;</l>
       <l n="6">A grave already to receive him</l>

       <l n="8">And speedy , speedy death to give him ,</l>
       <l n="9">Was all that of the Saints he pray 'd .</l>

       <l n="12">To God he paid his fervent duty ,</l>
       <l n="13">The woods grew more and more obscure :</l>
       <l n="14">Down o'er the lake a fog descended ,</l>
       <l n="15">And slow the full moon , red as blood ,</l>
       <l n="16">Midst threat'ning clouds up heaven wended —</l>
       <l n="17">Then gazed the Monk upon the flood .</l>

       <l n="21">And then subsiding to repose ,</l>
       <l n="22">And sudden , light as night-ghost wanders ,</l>
       <l n="23">A female thence her form uprais 'd ,</l>
       <l n="24">Pale as the snow which winter squanders ,</l>

       <l n="29">Looks wistful of her loveliness ;</l>

       <l n="38">Darkness again the wood investeth ,</l>
       <l n="39">The moon midst clouds is seen to sail ,</l>

       <l n="45">And wept and laugh 'd like infancy —</l>
       <l n="46">She names the monk , with tones heart-urging</l>
       <l n="47">Exclaims “ O Monk , come , come to me ! ” { 7 }</l>

       <l n="7">The lappets of its front were button 'd backward ,</l>
       <l n="8">And were spotted with the blood of unbelievers ;</l>

       <l n="30">Before the dread tribunal of the grand Tsar ,</l>
       <l n="31">Then our Tsar and Gosudar began to question :</l>
       <l n="32">Tell me , tell me , little lad , and peasant bantling !</l>
       <l n="33">Who assisted thee to ravage and to plunder ;</l>
       <l n="34">I trow thou hadst full many wicked comrades .</l>
       <l n="35">I 'll tell thee , Tsar ! our country 's hope and glory ,</l>
       <l n="36">I 'll tell thee all the truth , without a falsehood :</l>
       <l n="37">Thou must know that I had comrades , four in number ;</l>
       <l n="38">Of my comrades four the first was gloomy midnight ;</l>
       <l n="39">The second was a steely dudgeon dagger ;</l>
       <l n="40">The third it was a swift and speedy courser ;</l>
       <l n="41">The fourth of my companions was a bent bow ;</l>
       <l n="42">My messengers were furnace-harden 'd arrows .</l>
       <l n="43">Replied the Tsar , our country 's hope and glory :</l>
       <l n="44">Of a truth , thou little lad , and peasant 's bantling !</l>
       <l n="45">In thieving thou art skill 'd and giving answers ;</l>
       <l n="46">For thy answers and thy thieving I 'll reward thee</l>

       <l n="53">With the soft green grass and juicy clover ,</l>
       <l n="54">And with corn-flowers blooming and luxuriant .</l>
       <l n="55">One thing there is alone , that doth deform thee ;</l>
       <l n="56">In the midst of thee , O field , so fair and verdant !</l>
       <l n="57">A clump of bushes stands — a clump of hazels ,</l>
       <l n="58">Upon their very top there sits an eagle ,</l>
       <l n="59">And upon the bushes ’ top — upon the hazels ,</l>
       <l n="60">Compress 'd within his claw he holds a raven ,</l>
       <l n="61">And its hot blood he sprinkles on the dry ground ;</l>
       <l n="62">And beneath the bushes ’ clump — beneath the hazels ,</l>
       <l n="63">Lies void of life the good and gallant stripling ;</l>
       <l n="64">All wounded , pierc 'd and mangled is his body .</l>
       <l n="65">As the little tiny swallow or the chaffinch ,</l>
       <l n="66">Round their warm and cosey nest are seen to hover ,</l>
       <l n="67">So hovers there the mother dear who bore him ;</l>
       <l n="68">And aye she weeps , as flows a river 's water ;</l>
       <l n="69">His sister weeps as flows a streamlet 's water ;</l>
       <l n="70">His youthful wife , as falls the dew from heaven —</l>
       <l n="71">The Sun , arising , dries the dew of heaven .</l>
