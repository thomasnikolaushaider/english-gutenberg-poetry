    <p>“ Argonaut Edition ” Of The Works Of Bret Harte , Vol . 8 P. F. Collier &amp; Son New York Copyright 1882 , 1896 , And 1902 By Houghton , Mifflin &amp; Company BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH Although Bret Harte 's name is identified with Californian life , it was not till he was fifteen that the author of “ Plain Language from Truthful James ” saw the country of his adoption . Francis Bret Harte , to give the full name which he carried till he became famous , was born at Albany , New York , August 25 , 1839 . He went with his widowed mother to California in 1854 , and was thrown as a young man into the hurly-burly which he more than any other writer has made real to distant and later people . He was by turns a miner , school-teacher , express messenger , printer , and journalist . The types which live again in his pages are thus not only what he observed , but what he himself impersonated in his own experience . He began trying his pen in The Golden Era of San Francisco , where he was working as a compositor ; and when The Californian , edited by Charles Henry Webb , was started in 1864 as a literary newspaper , he was one of a group of brilliant young fellows — Mark Twain , Charles Warren Stoddard , Webb himself , and Prentice Mulford — who gave at once a new interest in California beside what mining and agriculture caused . Here in an early number appeared “ The Ballad of the Emeu , ” and he contributed many poems , grave and gay , as well as prose in a great variety of form . At the same time he was appointed Secretary of the United States Branch Mint at San Francisco , holding the office till 1870 . But Bret Harte 's great opportunity came when The Overland Monthly was established in 1868 by Anton Roman . This magazine was the outgrowth of the racy , exuberant literary spirit which had already found free expression in the journals named . An eager ambition to lift all the new life of the Pacific into a recognized place in the world of letters made the young men we have named put their wits together in a monthly magazine which should rival the Atlantic in Boston and Blackwood in Edinburgh . The name was easily had , and for a sign manual on the cover some one drew a grizzly bear , that formidable exemplar of Californian wildness . But the design did not quite satisfy , until Bret Harte , with a felicitous stroke , drew two parallel lines just before the feet of the halting brute . Now it was the grizzly of the wilderness drawing back before the railway of civilization , and the picture was complete as an emblem . Bret Harte became , by the common urgency of his companions , the first editor of the Overland , and at once his own tales and poems began , and in the second number appeared “ The Luck of Roaring Camp , ” which instantly brought him wide fame . In a few months he found himself besought for poems and articles , sketches and stories , in influential magazines , and in 1871 he turned away from the Pacific coast , and took up his residence , first in New York , afterward in Boston . “ No one , ” says his old friend , Mr. Stoddard , “ who knows Mr. Harte , and knew the California of his day , wonders that he left it as he did . Eastern editors were crying for his work . Cities vied with one another in the offer of tempting bait . When he turned his back on San Francisco , and started for Boston , he began a tour that the greatest author of any age might have been proud of . It was a veritable ovation that swelled from sea to sea : the classic sheep was sacrificed all along the route . I have often thought that if Bret Harte had met with a fatal accident during that transcontinental journey , the world would have declared with one voice that the greatest genius of his time was lost to it . ” In Boston he entered into an arrangement with the predecessors of the publishers of this volume , and his contributions appeared in their periodicals and were gathered into volumes . The arrangement in one form or another continued to the time of his death , and has for witness a stately array of comely volumes ; but the prose has far outstripped the poetry . There are few writers of Mr. Harte 's prodigality of nature who have used with so much fine reserve their faculty for melodious verse , and the present volume contains the entire body of his poetical work , growing by minute accretions during thirty odd years . In 1878 he was appointed United States Consul at Crefeld , Germany , and after that date he resided , with little interruption , on the Continent or in England . He was transferred to Glasgow in March , 1880 , and remained there until July , 1885 . During the rest of his life he made his home in London . His foreign residence is disclosed in a number of prose sketches and tales and in one or two poems ; but life abroad never dimmed the vividness of the impressions made on him by the experience of his early manhood when he partook of the elixir vitae of California , and the stories which from year to year flowed from an apparently inexhaustible fountain glittered with the gold washed down from the mountain slopes of that country which through his imagination he had made so peculiarly his own . Mr. Harte died suddenly at Camberley , England , May 6 , 1902 .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Have you heard the story that gossips tell</l>
     <l n="2">Of Burns of Gettysburg ?— No ? Ah , well :</l>
     <l n="3">Brief is the glory that hero earns ,</l>
     <l n="4">Briefer the story of poor John Burns .</l>
     <l n="5">He was the fellow who won renown ,—</l>
     <l n="6">The only man who did n't back down</l>
     <l n="7">When the rebels rode through his native town ;</l>
     <l n="8">But held his own in the fight next day ,</l>
     <l n="9">When all his townsfolk ran away .</l>
     <l n="10">That was in July sixty-three ,</l>
     <l n="11">The very day that General Lee ,</l>
     <l n="12">Flower of Southern chivalry ,</l>
     <l n="13">Baffled and beaten , backward reeled</l>
     <l n="14">From a stubborn Meade and a barren field .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="15">I might tell how but the day before</l>
     <l n="16">John Burns stood at his cottage door ,</l>
     <l n="17">Looking down the village street ,</l>
     <l n="18">Where , in the shade of his peaceful vine ,</l>
     <l n="19">He heard the low of his gathered kine ,</l>
     <l n="20">And felt their breath with incense sweet ;</l>
     <l n="21">Or I might say , when the sunset burned</l>
     <l n="22">The old farm gable , he thought it turned</l>
     <l n="23">The milk that fell like a babbling flood</l>
     <l n="24">Into the milk-pail red as blood !</l>
     <l n="25">Or how he fancied the hum of bees</l>
     <l n="26">Were bullets buzzing among the trees .</l>
     <l n="27">But all such fanciful thoughts as these</l>
     <l n="28">Were strange to a practical man like Burns ,</l>
     <l n="29">Who minded only his own concerns ,</l>
     <l n="30">Troubled no more by fancies fine</l>
     <l n="31">Than one of his calm-eyed , long-tailed kine ,—</l>
     <l n="32">Quite old-fashioned and matter-of-fact ,</l>
     <l n="33">Slow to argue , but quick to act .</l>
     <l n="34">That was the reason , as some folk say ,</l>
     <l n="35">He fought so well on that terrible day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="36">And it was terrible . On the right</l>
     <l n="37">Raged for hours the heady fight ,</l>
     <l n="38">Thundered the battery 's double bass ,—</l>
     <l n="39">Difficult music for men to face</l>
     <l n="40">While on the left — where now the graves</l>
     <l n="41">Undulate like the living waves</l>
     <l n="42">That all that day unceasing swept</l>
     <l n="43">Up to the pits the rebels kept —</l>
     <l n="44">Round shot ploughed the upland glades ,</l>
     <l n="45">Sown with bullets , reaped with blades ;</l>
     <l n="46">Shattered fences here and there</l>
     <l n="47">Tossed their splinters in the air ;</l>
     <l n="48">The very trees were stripped and bare ;</l>
     <l n="49">The barns that once held yellow grain</l>
     <l n="50">Were heaped with harvests of the slain ;</l>
     <l n="51">The cattle bellowed on the plain ,</l>
     <l n="52">The turkeys screamed with might and main ,</l>
     <l n="53">And brooding barn-fowl left their rest</l>
     <l n="54">With strange shells bursting in each nest .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="55">Just where the tide of battle turns ,</l>
     <l n="56">Erect and lonely stood old John Burns .</l>
     <l n="57">How do you think the man was dressed ?</l>
     <l n="58">He wore an ancient long buff vest ,</l>
     <l n="59">Yellow as saffron ,— but his best ;</l>
     <l n="60">And buttoned over his manly breast</l>
     <l n="61">Was a bright blue coat , with a rolling collar ,</l>
     <l n="62">And large gilt buttons ,— size of a dollar ,—</l>
     <l n="63">With tails that the country-folk called “ swaller . ”</l>
     <l n="64">He wore a broad-brimmed , bell-crowned hat ,</l>
     <l n="65">White as the locks on which it sat .</l>
     <l n="66">Never had such a sight been seen</l>
     <l n="67">For forty years on the village green ,</l>
     <l n="68">Since old John Burns was a country beau ,</l>
     <l n="69">And went to the “ quiltings ” long ago .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="70">Close at his elbows all that day ,</l>
     <l n="71">Veterans of the Peninsula ,</l>
     <l n="72">Sunburnt and bearded , charged away ;</l>
     <l n="73">And striplings , downy of lip and chin ,—</l>
     <l n="74">Clerks that the Home Guard mustered in ,—</l>
     <l n="75">Glanced , as they passed , at the hat he wore ,</l>
     <l n="76">Then at the rifle his right hand bore ,</l>
     <l n="77">And hailed him , from out their youthful lore ,</l>
     <l n="78">With scraps of a slangy repertoire :</l>
     <l n="79">“ How are you , White Hat ? ” “ Put her through ! ”</l>
     <l n="80">“ Your head 's level ! ” and “ Bully for you ! ”</l>
     <l n="81">Called him “ Daddy , ” — begged he 'd disclose</l>
     <l n="82">The name of the tailor who made his clothes ,</l>
     <l n="83">And what was the value he set on those ;</l>
     <l n="84">While Burns , unmindful of jeer and scoff ,</l>
     <l n="85">Stood there picking the rebels off ,—</l>
     <l n="86">With his long brown rifle and bell-crown hat ,</l>
     <l n="87">And the swallow-tails they were laughing at .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="88">‘ Twas but a moment , for that respect</l>
     <l n="89">Which clothes all courage their voices checked ;</l>
     <l n="90">And something the wildest could understand</l>
     <l n="91">Spake in the old man 's strong right hand ,</l>
     <l n="92">And his corded throat , and the lurking frown</l>
     <l n="93">Of his eyebrows under his old bell-crown ;</l>
     <l n="94">Until , as they gazed , there crept an awe</l>
     <l n="95">Through the ranks in whispers , and some men saw ,</l>
     <l n="96">In the antique vestments and long white hair ,</l>
     <l n="97">The Past of the Nation in battle there ;</l>
     <l n="98">And some of the soldiers since declare</l>
     <l n="99">That the gleam of his old white hat afar ,</l>
     <l n="100">Like the crested plume of the brave Navarre ,</l>
     <l n="101">That day was their oriflamme of war .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="102">So raged the battle . You know the rest :</l>
     <l n="103">How the rebels , beaten and backward pressed ,</l>
     <l n="104">Broke at the final charge and ran .</l>
     <l n="105">At which John Burns — a practical man —</l>
     <l n="106">Shouldered his rifle , unbent his brows ,</l>
     <l n="107">And then went back to his bees and cows .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="108">That is the story of old John Burns ;</l>
     <l n="109">This is the moral the reader learns :</l>
     <l n="110">In fighting the battle , the question 's whether</l>
     <l n="111">You 'll show a hat that 's white , or a feather !</l>

     <l n="3">Two hundred thousand men in blue ,</l>
     <l n="4">I think they said was the number ,—</l>
     <l n="5">Till I seemed to hear their trampling feet ,</l>
     <l n="6">The bugle blast and the drum 's quick beat ,</l>
     <l n="7">The clatter of hoofs in the stony street ,</l>
     <l n="8">The cheers of people who came to greet ,</l>
     <l n="9">And the thousand details that to repeat</l>
     <l n="10">Would only my verse encumber ,—</l>
     <l n="11">Till I fell in a reverie , sad and sweet ,</l>
     <l n="12">And then to a fitful slumber .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">When , lo ! in a vision I seemed to stand</l>
     <l n="14">In the lonely Capitol . On each hand</l>
     <l n="15">Far stretched the portico , dim and grand</l>
     <l n="16">Its columns ranged like a martial band</l>
     <l n="17">Of sheeted spectres , whom some command</l>
     <l n="18">Had called to a last reviewing .</l>
     <l n="19">And the streets of the city were white and bare ,</l>
     <l n="20">No footfall echoed across the square ;</l>
     <l n="21">But out of the misty midnight air</l>
     <l n="22">I heard in the distance a trumpet blare ,</l>
     <l n="23">And the wandering night-winds seemed to bear</l>
     <l n="24">The sound of a far tattooing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="25">Then I held my breath with fear and dread</l>
     <l n="26">For into the square , with a brazen tread ,</l>
     <l n="27">There rode a figure whose stately head</l>
     <l n="28">O'erlooked the review that morning ,</l>
     <l n="29">That never bowed from its firm-set seat</l>
     <l n="30">When the living column passed its feet ,</l>
     <l n="31">Yet now rode steadily up the street</l>
     <l n="32">To the phantom bugle 's warning :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="33">Till it reached the Capitol square , and wheeled ,</l>
     <l n="34">And there in the moonlight stood revealed</l>
     <l n="35">A well-known form that in State and field</l>
     <l n="36">Had led our patriot sires :</l>
     <l n="37">Whose face was turned to the sleeping camp ,</l>
     <l n="38">Afar through the river 's fog and damp ,</l>

     <l n="43">But keeping time to a throbbing hum</l>
     <l n="44">Of wailing and lamentation :</l>
     <l n="45">The martyred heroes of Malvern Hill ,</l>
     <l n="46">Of Gettysburg and Chancellorsville ,</l>
     <l n="47">The men whose wasted figures fill</l>
     <l n="48">The patriot graves of the nation .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="49">And there came the nameless dead ,— the men</l>
     <l n="50">Who perished in fever swamp and fen ,</l>
     <l n="51">The slowly-starved of the prison pen ;</l>
     <l n="52">And , marching beside the others ,</l>
     <l n="53">Came the dusky martyrs of Pillow 's fight ,</l>
     <l n="54">With limbs enfranchised and bearing bright ;</l>
     <l n="55">I thought — perhaps ‘ twas the pale moonlight —</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="57">And so all night marched the nation 's dead ,</l>
     <l n="58">With never a banner above them spread ,</l>
     <l n="59">Nor a badge , nor a motto brandished ;</l>
     <l n="60">No mark — save the bare uncovered head</l>
     <l n="61">Of the silent bronze Reviewer ;</l>
     <l n="62">With never an arch save the vaulted sky ;</l>
     <l n="63">With never a flower save those that lie</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="66">So all night long swept the strange array ,</l>

     <l n="68">I watched for one who had passed away ;</l>
     <l n="69">With a reverent awe and wonder ,—</l>
     <l n="70">Till a blue cap waved in the length'ning line ,</l>
     <l n="71">And I knew that one who was kin of mine</l>
     <l n="72">Had come ; and I spake — and lo ! that sign</l>
     <l n="73">Awakened me from my slumber .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">There is peace in the swamp where the Copperhead sleeps ,</l>
     <l n="3">Where the waters are stagnant , the white vapor creeps ,</l>
     <l n="4">Where the musk of Magnolia hangs thick in the air ,</l>
     <l n="5">And the lilies ’ phylacteries broaden in prayer .</l>
     <l n="6">There is peace in the swamp , though the quiet is death ,</l>
     <l n="7">Though the mist is miasma , the upas-tree 's breath ,</l>
     <l n="8">Though no echo awakes to the cooing of doves ,—</l>
     <l n="9">There is peace : yes , the peace that the Copperhead loves .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">Go seek him : he coils in the ooze and the drip ,</l>
     <l n="11">Like a thong idly flung from the slave-driver 's whip ;</l>
     <l n="12">But beware the false footstep ,— the stumble that brings</l>
     <l n="13">A deadlier lash than the overseer swings .</l>
     <l n="14">Never arrow so true , never bullet so dread ,</l>
     <l n="15">As the straight steady stroke of that hammer-shaped head ;</l>
     <l n="16">Whether slave or proud planter , who braves that dull crest ,</l>
     <l n="17">Woe to him who shall trouble the Copperhead 's rest !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="18">Then why waste your labors , brave hearts and strong men ,</l>
     <l n="19">In tracking a trail to the Copperhead 's den ?</l>
     <l n="20">Lay your axe to the cypress , hew open the shade</l>
     <l n="21">To the free sky and sunshine Jehovah has made ;</l>
     <l n="22">Let the breeze of the North sweep the vapors away ,</l>
     <l n="23">Till the stagnant lake ripples , the freed waters play ;</l>
     <l n="24">And then to your heel can you righteously doom</l>
     <l n="25">The Copperhead born of its shadow and gloom !</l>

     <l n="1">Here 's the spot . Look around you . Above on the height</l>

     <l n="28">Broke the door , stripped the pews , and dashed out in the road</l>
     <l n="29">With his arms full of hymn-books , and threw down his load</l>
     <l n="30">At their feet ! Then above all the shouting and shots</l>

    <head>THE MIRACLE OF PADRE JUNIPERO</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">This is the tale that the Chronicle</l>
     <l n="2">Tells of the wonderful miracle</l>
     <l n="3">Wrought by the pious Padre Serro ,</l>
     <l n="4">The very reverend Junipero .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The heathen stood on his ancient mound ,</l>
     <l n="6">Looking over the desert bound</l>
     <l n="7">Into the distant , hazy South ,</l>
     <l n="8">Over the dusty and broad champaign ,</l>
     <l n="9">Where , with many a gaping mouth</l>
     <l n="10">And fissure , cracked by the fervid drouth ,</l>
     <l n="11">For seven months had the wasted plain</l>
     <l n="12">Known no moisture of dew or rain .</l>
     <l n="13">The wells were empty and choked with sand ;</l>
     <l n="14">The rivers had perished from the land ;</l>
     <l n="15">Only the sea-fogs to and fro</l>
     <l n="16">Slipped like ghosts of the streams below .</l>
     <l n="17">Deep in its bed lay the river 's bones ,</l>
     <l n="18">Bleaching in pebbles and milk-white stones ,</l>
     <l n="19">And tracked o'er the desert faint and far ,</l>
     <l n="20">Its ribs shone bright on each sandy bar .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="21">Thus they stood as the sun went down</l>
     <l n="22">Over the foot-hills bare and brown ;</l>
     <l n="23">Thus they looked to the South , wherefrom</l>
     <l n="24">The pale-face medicine-man should come ,</l>
     <l n="25">Not in anger or in strife ,</l>
     <l n="26">But to bring — so ran the tale —</l>
     <l n="27">The welcome springs of eternal life ,</l>
     <l n="28">The living waters that should not fail .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="29">Said one , “ He will come like Manitou ,</l>
     <l n="30">Unseen , unheard , in the falling dew . ”</l>
     <l n="31">Said another , “ He will come full soon</l>
     <l n="32">Out of the round-faced watery moon . ”</l>
     <l n="33">And another said , “ He is here ! ” and lo ,</l>
     <l n="34">Faltering , staggering , feeble and slow ,</l>
     <l n="35">Out from the desert 's blinding heat</l>
     <l n="36">The Padre dropped at the heathen 's feet .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="37">They stood and gazed for a little space</l>
     <l n="38">Down on his pallid and careworn face ,</l>
     <l n="39">And a smile of scorn went round the band</l>
     <l n="40">As they touched alternate with foot and hand</l>
     <l n="41">This mortal waif , that the outer space</l>
     <l n="42">Of dim mysterious sky and sand</l>
     <l n="43">Flung with so little of Christian grace</l>
     <l n="44">Down on their barren , sterile strand .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="45">Said one to him : “ It seems thy God</l>
     <l n="46">Is a very pitiful kind of God :</l>
     <l n="47">He could not shield thine aching eyes</l>
     <l n="48">From the blowing desert sands that rise ,</l>
     <l n="49">Nor turn aside from thy old gray head</l>
     <l n="50">The glittering blade that is brandished</l>
     <l n="51">By the sun He set in the heavens high ;</l>
     <l n="52">He could not moisten thy lips when dry ;</l>
     <l n="53">The desert fire is in thy brain ;</l>
     <l n="54">Thy limbs are racked with the fever-pain .</l>
     <l n="55">If this be the grace He showeth thee</l>
     <l n="56">Who art His servant , what may we ,</l>
     <l n="57">Strange to His ways and His commands ,</l>
     <l n="58">Seek at His unforgiving hands ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="59">“ Drink but this cup , ” said the Padre , straight ,</l>
     <l n="60">“ And thou shalt know whose mercy bore</l>
     <l n="61">These aching limbs to your heathen door ,</l>
     <l n="62">And purged my soul of its gross estate .</l>
     <l n="63">Drink in His name , and thou shalt see</l>
     <l n="64">The hidden depths of this mystery .</l>
     <l n="65">Drink ! ” and he held the cup . One blow</l>
     <l n="66">From the heathen dashed to the ground below</l>
     <l n="67">The sacred cup that the Padre bore ,</l>
     <l n="68">And the thirsty soil drank the precious store</l>
     <l n="69">Of sacramental and holy wine ,</l>
     <l n="70">That emblem and consecrated sign</l>
     <l n="71">And blessed symbol of blood divine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="72">Then , says the legend ( and they who doubt</l>
     <l n="73">The same as heretics be accurst ) ,</l>
     <l n="74">From the dry and feverish soil leaped out</l>
     <l n="75">A living fountain ; a well-spring burst</l>
     <l n="76">Over the dusty and broad champaign ,</l>
     <l n="77">Over the sandy and sterile plain ,</l>
     <l n="78">Till the granite ribs and the milk-white stones</l>
     <l n="79">That lay in the valley — the scattered bones —</l>
     <l n="80">Moved in the river and lived again !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="81">Such was the wonderful miracle</l>
     <l n="82">Wrought by the cup of wine that fell</l>
     <l n="83">From the hands of the pious Padre Serro ,</l>
     <l n="84">The very reverend Junipero .</l>

     <l n="12">Found the spring , and found it , too ,</l>
     <l n="13">By his mule 's miraculous cast of a shoe ;</l>
     <l n="14">For his beast — a descendant of Balaam 's ass —</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="16">The Padre thought the omen good ,</l>

     <l n="19">On the honest faith of a true believer —</l>
     <l n="20">His cheeks , though wasted , lank , and bare ,</l>
     <l n="21">Filled like a withered russet pear</l>
     <l n="22">In the vacuum of a glass receiver ,</l>

     <l n="28">Of who were worthiest to use</l>
     <l n="29">The magic spring ; but the prior claim</l>
     <l n="30">Fell to the aged , sick , and lame .</l>
     <l n="31">Far and wide the people came :</l>

     <l n="33">Hastened to bring their helpless sick ;</l>
     <l n="34">Even the fishers of rude Soquel</l>
     <l n="35">Suddenly found they were far from well ;</l>
     <l n="36">The brawny dwellers of San Lorenzo</l>
     <l n="37">Said , in fact , they had never been so ;</l>
     <l n="38">And all were ailing ,— strange to say ,—</l>
     <l n="39">From Pescadero to Monterey .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="40">Over the mountain they poured in ,</l>

     <l n="42">Through the canyons a motley throng</l>
     <l n="43">Trotted , hobbled , and limped along .</l>
     <l n="44">The Fathers gazed at the moving scene</l>
     <l n="45">With pious joy and with souls serene ;</l>

     <l n="48">Not in the eyes of faith alone</l>
     <l n="49">The good effects of the water shone ;</l>
     <l n="50">But skins grew rosy , eyes waxed clear ,</l>
     <l n="51">Of rough vaquero and muleteer ;</l>
     <l n="52">Angular forms were rounded out ,</l>
     <l n="53">Limbs grew supple and waists grew stout ;</l>
     <l n="54">And as for the girls ,— for miles about</l>

     <l n="84">And so was the ghost of Diego laid</l>

     <l n="92">So , to return . As I said before ,</l>

     <l n="94">We saved the lamb in the wolf 's own jaw ,</l>
     <l n="95">And that 's my moral . The tale , I fear ,</l>
     <l n="96">But poorly told . Yet it strikes me here</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">It was the morning season of the year ;</l>
     <l n="2">It was the morning era of the land ;</l>
     <l n="3">The watercourses rang full loud and clear ;</l>
     <l n="4">Portala 's cross stood where Portala 's hand</l>
     <l n="5">Had planted it when Faith was taught by Fear ,</l>
     <l n="6">When monks and missions held the sole command</l>
     <l n="7">Of all that shore beside the peaceful sea ,</l>
     <l n="8">Where spring-tides beat their long-drawn reveille .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Out of the mission of San Luis Rey ,</l>
     <l n="10">All in that brisk , tumultuous spring weather ,</l>
     <l n="11">Rode Friar Pedro , in a pious way ,</l>
     <l n="12">With six dragoons in cuirasses of leather ,</l>
     <l n="13">Each armed alike for either prayer or fray ;</l>
     <l n="14">Handcuffs and missals they had slung together ,</l>
     <l n="15">And as an aid the gospel truth to scatter</l>

     <l n="17">In sooth , that year the harvest had been slack ,</l>

     <l n="19">Some souls were lost , whose owners had turned back</l>
     <l n="20">To save their bodies frequent flagellation ;</l>
     <l n="21">And some preferred the songs of birds , alack !</l>
     <l n="22">To Latin matins and their souls ’ salvation ,</l>
     <l n="23">And thought their own wild whoopings were less dreary</l>

     <l n="25">To bring them back to matins and to prime ,</l>

     <l n="28">This was , in fact , the Padre 's present mission ;</l>

     <l n="30">And bring them to a “ sense of their condition , ” —</l>
     <l n="31">That easy phrase , which , in the past and present ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">He saw the glebe land guiltless of a furrow ;</l>

     <l n="41">He saw the flapping crow , whose frequent note</l>

     <l n="44">His priestly presence as he trotted by .</l>
     <l n="45">He would have cursed the bird by bell and rote ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="49">He rang his bell , and at the martial sound</l>
     <l n="50">Twelve silver spurs their jingling rowels clashed ;</l>

     <l n="52">As six dragoons in open order dashed ;</l>
     <l n="53">Above their heads the lassos circled round ,</l>
     <l n="54">In every eye a pious fervor flashed ;</l>
     <l n="55">They charged the camp , and in one moment more</l>

     <l n="57">The Friar saw the conflict from a knoll ,</l>

     <l n="70">And every other prudent thought excluded ;</l>
     <l n="71">He caught a lasso , and dashed in a canter</l>

     <l n="73">High o'er his head he swirled the dreadful noose ;</l>

     <l n="75">His first cast tore Felipe 's captive loose ,</l>
     <l n="76">And almost choked Tiburcio Camilla ,</l>
     <l n="77">And might have interfered with that brave youth 's</l>
     <l n="78">Ability to gorge the tough tortilla ;</l>
     <l n="79">But all things come by practice , and at last</l>
     <l n="80">His flying slip-knot caught the maiden fast .</l>

     <l n="81">Then rose above the plain a mingled yell</l>

     <l n="84">And would have loosened his unchristian loop ;</l>
     <l n="85">But the tough raw-hide held the captive well ,</l>
     <l n="86">And held , alas ! too well the captor-dupe ;</l>
     <l n="87">For with one bound the savage fled amain ,</l>

     <l n="89">Down the arroyo , out across the mead ,</l>

     <l n="92">And helpless Friar , who in vain essayed</l>
     <l n="93">To cut the lasso or to check his speed .</l>
     <l n="94">He felt himself beyond all human aid ,</l>

     <l n="97">Alas ! the lasso had been duly blessed ,</l>

     <l n="100">Which , like the lasso , might be made to stretch ,</l>
     <l n="101">But would not break ; so neither could divest</l>
     <l n="102">Themselves of it , but , like some awful fetch ,</l>
     <l n="103">The holy Friar had to recognize</l>
     <l n="104">The image of his fate in heathen guise .</l>

     <l n="109">He saw all this , and felt no doubt how thorough</l>
     <l n="110">The contrast was to his condition ; still</l>
     <l n="111">The squaw kept onward to the sea , till night</l>

     <l n="125">In this surmise some miracles were wrought</l>

     <l n="134">At morning mass , when , says the old tradition ,</l>
     <l n="135">A frightful whoop throughout the church resounded ,</l>

    <head>THOMPSON OF ANGELS</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">It is the story of Thompson — of Thompson , the hero of Angels .</l>
     <l n="2">Frequently drunk was Thompson , but always polite to the stranger ;</l>
     <l n="3">Light and free was the touch of Thompson upon his revolver ;</l>
     <l n="4">Great the mortality incident on that lightness and freedom .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Yet not happy or gay was Thompson , the hero of Angels ;</l>
     <l n="6">Often spoke to himself in accents of anguish and sorrow ,</l>
     <l n="7">“ Why do I make the graves of the frivolous youth who in folly</l>
     <l n="8">Thoughtlessly pass my revolver , forgetting its lightness and freedom ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">“ Why in my daily walks does the surgeon drop his left eyelid ,</l>
     <l n="10">The undertaker smile , and the sculptor of gravestone marbles</l>
     <l n="11">Lean on his chisel and gaze ? I care not o'er much for attention ;</l>
     <l n="12">Simple am I in my ways , save but for this lightness and freedom . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">So spake that pensive man — this Thompson , the hero of Angels ,</l>
     <l n="14">Bitterly smiled to himself , as he strode through the chapparal musing .</l>
     <l n="15">“ Why , oh , why ? ” echoed the pines in the dark olive depth far</l>
     <l n="16">resounding .</l>
     <l n="17">“ Why , indeed ? ” whispered the sage brush that bent ‘ neath his feet</l>
     <l n="18">non-elastic .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="19">Pleasant indeed was that morn that dawned o'er the barroom at Angels ,</l>
     <l n="20">Where in their manhood 's prime was gathered the pride of the hamlet .</l>
     <l n="21">Six “ took sugar in theirs , ” and nine to the barkeeper lightly</l>
     <l n="22">Smiled as they said , “ Well , Jim , you can give us our regular fusil . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="23">Suddenly as the gray hawk swoops down on the barnyard , alighting</l>
     <l n="24">Where , pensively picking their corn , the favorite pullets are</l>
     <l n="25">gathered ,</l>
     <l n="26">So in that festive bar-room dropped Thompson , the hero of Angels ,</l>
     <l n="27">Grasping his weapon dread with his pristine lightness and freedom .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="28">Never a word he spoke ; divesting himself of his garments ,</l>
     <l n="29">Danced the war-dance of the playful yet truculent Modoc ,</l>
     <l n="30">Uttered a single whoop , and then , in the accents of challenge ,</l>
     <l n="31">Spake : “ Oh , behold in me a Crested Jay Hawk of the mountain . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="32">Then rose a pallid man — a man sick with fever and ague ;</l>
     <l n="33">Small was he , and his step was tremulous , weak , and uncertain ;</l>
     <l n="34">Slowly a Derringer drew , and covered the person of Thompson ;</l>
     <l n="35">Said in his feeblest pipe , “ I 'm a Bald-headed Snipe of the Valley . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="36">As on its native plains the kangaroo , startled by hunters ,</l>
     <l n="37">Leaps with successive bounds , and hurries away to the thickets ,</l>
     <l n="38">So leaped the Crested Hawk , and quietly hopping behind him</l>
     <l n="39">Ran , and occasionally shot , that Bald-headed Snipe of the Valley .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="40">Vain at the festive bar still lingered the people of Angels ,</l>
     <l n="41">Hearing afar in the woods the petulant pop of the pistol ;</l>
     <l n="42">Never again returned the Crested Jay Hawk of the mountains ,</l>
     <l n="43">Never again was seen the Bald-headed Snipe of the Valley .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="44">Yet in the hamlet of Angels , when truculent speeches are uttered ,</l>
     <l n="45">When bloodshed and life alone will atone for some trifling</l>
     <l n="46">misstatement ,</l>
     <l n="47">Maidens and men in their prime recall the last hero of Angels ,</l>
     <l n="48">Think of and vainly regret the Bald-headed Snipe of the Valley !</l>

   <p>A QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE</p>
   <p>REPORTED BY TRUTHFUL JAMES</p>
   <p>It was Andrew Jackson Sutter who , despising Mr. Cutter for remarks he heard him utter in debate upon the floor , Swung him up into the skylight , in the peaceful , pensive twilight , and then keerlessly proceeded , makin ’ no account what WE did — To wipe up with his person casual dust upon the floor .</p>
   <p>Now a square fight never frets me , nor unpleasantness upsets me , but the simple thing that gets me — now the job is done and gone , And we 've come home free and merry from the peaceful cemetery , leavin ’ Cutter there with Sutter — that mebbee just a stutter On the part of Mr. Cutter caused the loss we deeply mourn .</p>
   <p>Some bashful hesitation , just like spellin ’ punctooation — might have worked an aggravation on to Sutter 's mournful mind , For the witnesses all vary ez to wot was said and nary a galoot will toot his horn except the way he is inclined .</p>
   <p>But they all allow that Sutter had begun a kind of mutter , when uprose Mr. Cutter with a sickening kind of ease , And proceeded then to wade in to the subject then prevadin ': “ Is Profanity degradin ’ ? ” in words like unto these :</p>
   <p>“ Onlike the previous speaker , Mr. Sutter of Yreka , he was but a humble seeker — and not like him — a cuss ” — It was here that Mr. Sutter softly reached for Mr. Cutter , when the latter with a stutter said : “ ac-customed to discuss . ”</p>
   <p>Then Sutter he rose grimly , and sorter smilin ’ dimly bowed onto the Chairman primly — ( just like Cutter ez could be ! ) Drawled “ he guessed he must fall — back — as — Mr. Cutter owned the pack — as — he just had played the — Jack — as — ” ( here Cutter 's gun went crack ! as Mr. Sutter gasped and ended ) “ every man can see ! ”</p>
   <p>But William Henry Pryor — just in range of Sutter 's fire — here evinced a wild desire to do somebody harm , And in the general scrimmage no one thought if Sutter 's “ image ” was a misplaced punctooation — like the hole in Pryor 's arm .</p>
   <p>For we all waltzed in together , never carin ’ to ask whether it was Sutter or was Cutter we woz tryin ’ to abate . But we could n't help perceivin ’ , when we took to inkstand heavin ’ , that the process was relievin ’ to the sharpness of debate ,</p>
   <p>So we 've come home free and merry from the peaceful cemetery , and I make no commentary on these simple childish games ; Things is various and human — and the man ai n't born of woman who is free to intermeddle with his pal 's intents and aims .</p>

     <l n="2">And drop them books and first pot-hooks , and hear a yarn from me .</l>
     <l n="3">I kin not sling a fairy tale of Jinnys * fierce and wild ,</l>

     <l n="5">But as from school yer driftin ’ by , I thowt ye 'd like to hear</l>
     <l n="6">Of a “ Spelling Bee ” at Angels that we organized last year .</l>

     <l n="7">It war n't made up of gentle kids , of pretty kids , like you ,</l>
     <l n="8">But gents ez hed their reg'lar growth , and some enough for two .</l>
     <l n="9">There woz Lanky Jim of Sutter 's Fork and Bilson of Lagrange ,</l>
     <l n="10">And “ Pistol Bob , ” who wore that day a knife by way of change .</l>
     <l n="11">You start , you little kids , you think these are not pretty names ,</l>
     <l n="12">But each had a man behind it , and — my name is Truthful James .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">There was Poker Dick from Whisky Flat , and Smith of Shooter 's Bend ,</l>
     <l n="14">And Brown of Calaveras — which I want no better friend ;</l>
     <l n="15">Three-fingered Jack — yes , pretty dears , three fingers — YOU have five .</l>
     <l n="16">Clapp cut off two — it 's sing'lar , too , that Clapp ai n't now alive .</l>
     <l n="17">‘ Twas very wrong indeed , my dears , and Clapp was much to blame ;</l>
     <l n="18">Likewise was Jack , in after-years , for shootin ’ of that same .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">The nights was kinder lengthenin ’ out , the rains had jest begun ,</l>
     <l n="20">When all the camp came up to Pete 's to have their usual fun ;</l>
     <l n="21">But we all sot kinder sad-like around the bar-room stove</l>
     <l n="22">Till Smith got up , permiskiss-like , and this remark he hove :</l>
     <l n="23">“ Thar 's a new game down in Frisco , that ez far ez I can see</l>
     <l n="24">Beats euchre , poker , and van-toon , they calls the ‘ Spellin ’ Bee . ’ ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">Then Brown of Calaveras simply hitched his chair and spake ,</l>
     <l n="26">“ Poker is good enough for me , ” and Lanky Jim sez , “ Shake ! ”</l>
     <l n="27">And Bob allowed he war n't proud , but he “ must say right thar</l>
     <l n="28">That the man who tackled euchre hed his education squar . ”</l>
     <l n="29">This brought up Lenny Fairchild , the schoolmaster , who said</l>
     <l n="30">He knew the game , and he would give instructions on that head .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">“ For instance , take some simple word , ” sez he , “ like ‘ separate : ’</l>
     <l n="32">Now who can spell it ? ” Dog my skin , ef thar was one in eight .</l>
     <l n="33">This set the boys all wild at once . The chairs was put in row ,</l>
     <l n="34">And at the head was Lanky Jim , and at the foot was Joe ,</l>
     <l n="35">And high upon the bar itself the schoolmaster was raised ,</l>
     <l n="36">And the bar-keep put his glasses down , and sat and silent gazed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">The first word out was “ parallel , ” and seven let it be ,</l>
     <l n="38">Till Joe waltzed in his “ double l ” betwixt the “ a ” and “ e ; ”</l>
     <l n="39">For since he drilled them Mexicans in San Jacinto 's fight</l>
     <l n="40">Thar war n't no prouder man got up than Pistol Joe that night —</l>
     <l n="41">Till “ rhythm ” came ! He tried to smile , then said “ they had him</l>
     <l n="42">there , ”</l>
     <l n="43">And Lanky Jim , with one long stride , got up and took his chair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="44">O little kids , my pretty kids , ‘ twas touchin ’ to survey</l>
     <l n="45">These bearded men , with weppings on , like schoolboys at their play .</l>
     <l n="46">They 'd laugh with glee , and shout to see each other lead the van ,</l>
     <l n="47">And Bob sat up as monitor with a cue for a rattan ,</l>
     <l n="48">Till the Chair gave out “ incinerate , ” and Brown said he 'd be durned</l>
     <l n="49">If any such blamed word as that in school was ever learned .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="50">When “ phthisis ” came they all sprang up , and vowed the man who rung</l>
     <l n="51">Another blamed Greek word on them be taken out and hung .</l>
     <l n="52">As they sat down again I saw in Bilson 's eye a flash ,</l>
     <l n="53">And Brown of Calaveras was a-twistin ’ his mustache ,</l>
     <l n="54">And when at last Brown slipped on “ gneiss , ” and Bilson took his chair ,</l>
     <l n="55">He dropped some casual words about some folks who dyed their hair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="56">And then the Chair grew very white , and the Chair said he 'd adjourn ,</l>
     <l n="57">But Poker Dick remarked that HE would wait and get his turn ;</l>
     <l n="58">Then with a tremblin ’ voice and hand , and with a wanderin ’ eye ,</l>
     <l n="59">The Chair next offered “ eider-duck , ” and Dick began with “ I ” ,</l>
     <l n="60">And Bilson smiled — then Bilson shrieked ! Just how the fight begun</l>
     <l n="61">I never knowed , for Bilson dropped , and Dick , he moved up one .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="62">Then certain gents arose and said “ they 'd business down in camp , ”</l>
     <l n="63">And “ ez the road was rather dark , and ez the night was damp ,</l>
     <l n="64">They 'd ” — here got up Three-fingered Jack and locked the door and</l>
     <l n="65">yelled :</l>
     <l n="66">“ No , not one mother 's son goes out till that thar word is spelled ! ”</l>
     <l n="67">But while the words were on his lips , he groaned and sank in pain ,</l>
     <l n="68">And sank with Webster on his chest and Worcester on his brain .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="69">Below the bar dodged Poker Dick , and tried to look ez he</l>

     <l n="72">Till it upsot and down his legs the cinders freely rolled ,</l>
     <l n="73">And several gents called “ Order ! ” till in his simple way</l>
     <l n="74">Poor Smith began with “ O-r ” — “ Or ” — and he was dragged away .</l>

     <l n="41">The light of my study-lamp streams out</l>

     <l n="49">I open the window , and seem almost —</l>

     <l n="64">Awakens my buried past .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="65">And I think of the passion that shook my youth ,</l>

     <l n="67">And am thankful now for the certain truth</l>
     <l n="68">That only the sweet remains .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="69">And I hear no rustle of stiff brocade ,</l>
     <l n="70">And I see no face at my library door ;</l>
     <l n="71">For now that the ghosts of my heart are laid ,</l>
     <l n="72">She is viewless for evermore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="73">But whether she came as a faint perfume ,</l>
     <l n="74">Or whether a spirit in stole of white ,</l>
     <l n="75">I feel , as I pass from the darkened room ,</l>
     <l n="76">She has been with my soul to-night !</l>

   <p>Go , don the dress coat of our tyrant ,— youth 's panoplied armor for fight ,— And tie the white neckcloth that rumples , like pleasure , and lasts but a night ; And pray the Nine Gods to avert you what time the Three Sisters shall frown , And you 'll lose your high-comedy figure , and sit more at ease in your gown .</p>

   <p>“ Then you told her your love ? ” asked the elder . The younger looked up with a smile : “ I sat by her side half an hour — what else was I doing the while ?</p>
   <p>“ What , sit by the side of a woman as fair as the sun in the sky , And look somewhere else lest the dazzle flash back from your own to her eye ?</p>
   <p>“ No , I hold that the speech of the tongue be as frank and as bold as the look , And I held up herself to herself ,— that was more than she got from her book . ”</p>
   <p>“ Young blood ! ” laughed the elder ; “ no doubt you are voicing the mode of To-Day : But then we old fogies at least gave the lady some chance for delay .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ There 's my wife ( you must know ) ,— we first met on the journey from</l>
     <l n="2">Florence to Rome :</l>
     <l n="3">It took me three weeks to discover who was she and where was her home ;</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Three more to be duly presented ; three more ere I saw her again ; And a year ere my romance BEGAN where yours ended that day on the train . ”</p>
   <p>“ Oh , that was the style of the stage-coach ; we travel to-day by express ; Forty miles to the hour , ” he answered , “ wo n't admit of a passion that 's less . ”</p>
   <p>“ But what if you make a mistake ? ” quoth the elder . The younger half sighed . “ What happens when signals are wrong or switches misplaced ? ” he replied .</p>
   <p>“ Very well , I must bow to your wisdom , ” the elder returned , “ but submit Your chances of winning this woman your boldness has bettered no whit .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Why , you do not at best know her name . And what if I try your ideal</l>
     <l n="2">With something , if not quite so fair , at least more en regle and real ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Let me find you a partner . Nay , come , I insist — you shall follow — this way . My dear , will you not add your grace to entreat Mr . Rapid to stay ?</p>
   <p>“ My wife , Mr . Rapid — Eh , what ! Why , he 's gone — yet he said he would come . How rude ! I do n't wonder , my dear , you are properly crimson and dumb ! ”</p>

    <head>THE OLD CAMP-FIRE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Now shift the blanket pad before your saddle back you fling ,</l>
     <l n="2">And draw your cinch up tighter till the sweat drops from the ring :</l>
     <l n="3">We 've a dozen miles to cover ere we reach the next divide .</l>
     <l n="4">Our limbs are stiffer now than when we first set out to ride ,</l>
     <l n="5">And worse , the horses know it , and feel the leg-grip tire ,</l>
     <l n="6">Since in the days when , long ago , we sought the old camp-fire .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Yes , twenty years ! Lord ! how we 'd scent its incense down the trail ,</l>
     <l n="8">Through balm of bay and spice of spruce , when eye and ear would fail ,</l>
     <l n="9">And worn and faint from useless quest we crept , like this , to rest ,</l>
     <l n="10">Or , flushed with luck and youthful hope , we rode , like this , abreast .</l>
     <l n="11">Ay ! straighten up , old friend , and let the mustang think he 's nigher ,</l>
     <l n="12">Through looser rein and stirrup strain , the welcome old camp-fire .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">You know the shout that would ring out before us down the glade ,</l>
     <l n="14">And start the blue jays like a flight of arrows through the shade ,</l>
     <l n="15">And sift the thin pine needles down like slanting , shining rain ,</l>
     <l n="16">And send the squirrels scampering back to their holes again ,</l>
     <l n="17">Until we saw , blue-veiled and dim , or leaping like desire ,</l>
     <l n="18">That flame of twenty years ago , which lit the old camp-fire .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">And then that rest on Nature 's breast , when talk had dropped , and slow</l>
     <l n="20">The night wind went from tree to tree with challenge soft and low !</l>
     <l n="21">We lay on lazy elbows propped , or stood to stir the flame ,</l>
     <l n="22">Till up the soaring redwood 's shaft our shadows danced and came ,</l>
     <l n="23">As if to draw us with the sparks , high o'er its unseen spire ,</l>
     <l n="24">To the five stars that kept their ward above the old camp-fire ,—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">Those picket stars whose tranquil watch half soothed , half shamed</l>
     <l n="26">our sleep .</l>
     <l n="27">What recked we then what beasts or men around might lurk or creep ?</l>
     <l n="28">We lay and heard with listless ears the far-off panther 's cry ,</l>
     <l n="29">The near coyote 's snarling snap , the grizzly 's deep-drawn sigh ,</l>
     <l n="30">The brown bear 's blundering human tread , the gray wolves ’ yelping</l>
     <l n="31">choir</l>
     <l n="32">Beyond the magic circle drawn around the old camp-fire .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="33">And then that morn ! Was ever morn so filled with all things new ?</l>
     <l n="34">The light that fell through long brown aisles from out the kindling</l>
     <l n="35">blue ,</l>
     <l n="36">The creak and yawn of stretching boughs , the jay-bird 's early call ,</l>
     <l n="37">The rat-tat-tat of woodpecker that waked the woodland hall ,</l>
     <l n="38">The fainter stir of lower life in fern and brake and brier ,</l>
     <l n="39">Till flashing leaped the torch of Day from last night 's old camp-fire !</l>

     <l n="40">Well , well ! we 'll see it once again ; we should be near it now ;</l>
     <l n="41">It 's scarce a mile to where the trail strikes off to skirt the slough ,</l>
     <l n="42">And then the dip to Indian Spring , the wooded rise , and — strange !</l>
     <l n="43">Yet here should stand the blasted pine that marked our farther range ;</l>
     <l n="44">And here — what 's this ? A ragged swab of ruts and stumps and mire !</l>
     <l n="45">Sure this is not the sacred grove that hid the old camp-fire !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="46">Yet here 's the “ blaze ” I cut myself , and there 's the stumbling ledge ,</l>
     <l n="47">With quartz “ outcrop ” that lay atop , now leveled to its edge ,</l>
     <l n="48">And mounds of moss-grown stumps beside the woodman 's rotting chips ,</l>
     <l n="49">And gashes in the hillside , that gape with dumb red lips .</l>
     <l n="50">And yet above the shattered wreck and ruin , curling higher —</l>
     <l n="51">Ah yes !— still lifts the smoke that marked the welcome old camp-fire !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="52">Perhaps some friend of twenty years still lingers there to raise</l>
     <l n="53">To weary hearts and tired eyes that beacon of old days .</l>
     <l n="54">Perhaps but stay ; ‘ tis gone ! and yet once more it lifts as though</l>
     <l n="55">To meet our tardy blundering steps , and seems to MOVE , and lo !</l>
     <l n="56">Whirls by us in a rush of sound ,— the vanished funeral pyre</l>
     <l n="57">Of hopes and fears that twenty years burned in the old camp-fire !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="58">For see , beyond the prospect spreads , with chimney , spire , and roof ,—</l>
     <l n="59">Two iron bands across the trail clank to our mustang 's hoof ;</l>
     <l n="60">Above them leap two blackened threads from limb-lopped tree to tree ,</l>
     <l n="61">To where the whitewashed station speeds its message to the sea .</l>
     <l n="62">Rein in ! Rein in ! The quest is o'er . The goal of our desire</l>
     <l n="63">Is but the train whose track has lain across the old camp-fire !</l>

    <head>MASTER JOHNNY 'S NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">It was spring the first time that I saw her , for her papa and mamma</l>
     <l n="2">moved in</l>
     <l n="3">Next door , just as skating was over , and marbles about to begin ;</l>
     <l n="4">For the fence in our back yard was broken , and I saw , as I peeped</l>
     <l n="5">through the slat ,</l>
     <l n="6">There were “ Johnny-jump-ups ” all around her , and I knew it was</l>
     <l n="7">spring just by that .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">I never knew whether she saw me , for she did n't say nothing to me ,</l>
     <l n="9">But “ Ma ! here 's a slat in the fence broke , and the boy that is next</l>
     <l n="10">door can see . ”</l>
     <l n="11">But the next day I climbed on our wood-shed , as you know Mamma says</l>
     <l n="12">I 've a right ,</l>
     <l n="13">And she calls out , “ Well , peekin ’ is manners ! ” and I answered her ,</l>
     <l n="14">“ Sass is perlite ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">But I was n't a bit mad , no , Papa , and to prove it , the very next day ,</l>
     <l n="16">When she ran past our fence in the morning I happened to get in her</l>
     <l n="17">way ,—</l>
     <l n="18">For you know I am “ chunked ” and clumsy , as she says are all boys of</l>
     <l n="19">my size ,—</l>
     <l n="20">And she nearly upset me , she did , Pa , and laughed till tears came in</l>
     <l n="21">her eyes .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>And then we were friends from that moment , for I knew that she told Kitty Sage ,— And she was n't a girl that would flatter — “ that she thought I was tall for my age . ” And I gave her four apples that evening , and took her to ride on my sled , And — “ What am I telling you this for ? ” Why , Papa , my neighbor is DEAD !</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">You do n't hear one half I am saying ,— I really do think it 's too bad !</l>
     <l n="2">Why , you might have seen crape on her door-knob , and noticed to-day</l>
     <l n="3">I 've been sad .</l>
     <l n="4">And they 've got her a coffin of rosewood , and they say they have</l>
     <l n="5">dressed her in white ,</l>
     <l n="6">And I 've never once looked through the fence , Pa , since she died — at</l>
     <l n="7">eleven last night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">And Ma says it 's decent and proper , as I was her neighbor and friend ,</l>
     <l n="9">That I should go there to the funeral , and she thinks that YOU ought</l>
     <l n="10">to attend ;</l>
     <l n="11">But I am so clumsy and awkward , I know I shall be in the way ,</l>
     <l n="12">And suppose they should speak to me , Papa , I would n't know just what</l>
     <l n="13">to say .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="14">So I think I will get up quite early ,— I know I sleep late , but I know</l>
     <l n="15">I 'll be sure to wake up if our Bridget pulls the string that I 'll tie</l>
     <l n="16">to my toe ;</l>
     <l n="17">And I 'll crawl through the fence , and I 'll gather the “ Johnny-jump-ups ”</l>
     <l n="18">as they grew</l>
     <l n="19">Round her feet the first day that I saw her , and , Papa , I 'll give</l>
     <l n="20">them to you .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>For you 're a big man , and , you know , Pa , can come and go just where you choose , And you 'll take the flowers in to her , and surely they 'll never refuse ; But , Papa , do n't SAY they 're from Johnny ; THEY wo n't understand , do n't you see ? But just lay them down on her bosom , and , Papa , SHE 'LL know they 're from Me .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>MISS EDITH 'S MODEST REQUEST</head>
    <head>My Papa knows you , and he says you 're a man who makes reading for books ; But I never read nothing you wrote , nor did Papa ,— I know by his looks . So I guess you 're like me when I talk , and I talk , and I talk all the day , And they only say , “ Do stop that child ! ” or , “ Nurse , take Miss Edith away . ”</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">But Papa said if I was good I could ask you — alone by myself —</l>
     <l n="2">If you would n't write me a book like that little one up on the shelf .</l>
     <l n="3">I do n't mean the pictures , of course , for to make THEM you 've got to</l>
     <l n="4">be smart</l>
     <l n="5">But the reading that runs all around them , you know ,— just the</l>
     <l n="6">easiest part .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">You need n't mind what it 's about , for no one will see it but me ,</l>
     <l n="8">And Jane ,— that 's my nurse ,— and John ,— he 's the coachman ,— just</l>
     <l n="9">only us three .</l>
     <l n="10">You 're to write of a bad little girl , that was wicked and bold and</l>
     <l n="11">all that ;</l>
     <l n="12">And then you 're to write , if you please , something good — very good —</l>
     <l n="13">of a cat !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>This cat , she was virtuous and meek , and kind to her parents , and mild , And careful and neat in her ways , though her mistress was such a bad child ; And hours she would sit and would gaze when her mistress — that 's me — was so bad , And blink , just as if she would say , “ Oh , Edith ! you make my heart sad . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And yet , you would scarcely believe it , that beautiful , angelic cat</l>
     <l n="2">Was blamed by the servants for stealing whatever , they said , she 'd</l>
     <l n="3">get at .</l>
     <l n="4">And when John drank my milk ,— do n't you tell me ! I know just the</l>
     <l n="5">way it was done ,—</l>
     <l n="6">They said ‘ twas the cat ,— and she sitting and washing her face in</l>
     <l n="7">the sun !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And then there was Dick , my canary . When I left its cage open one day , They all made believe that she ate it , though I know that the bird flew away . And why ? Just because she was playing with a feather she found on the floor . As if cats could n't play with a feather without people thinking ‘ twas more !</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Why , once we were romping together , when I knocked down a vase from</l>
     <l n="2">the shelf ,</l>
     <l n="3">That cat was as grieved and distressed as if she had done it herself ;</l>
     <l n="4">And she walked away sadly and hid herself , and never came out until</l>
     <l n="5">tea ,—</l>

   <p>MISS EDITH MAKES ANOTHER FRIEND</p>
   <p>Oh , you 're the girl lives on the corner ? Come in — if you want to — come quick ! There 's no one but me in the house , and the cook — but she 's only a stick . Do n't try the front way , but come over the fence — through the window — that 's how . Do n't mind the big dog — he wo n't bite you — just see him obey me ! there , now !</p>
   <p>What 's your name ? Mary Ellen ? How funny ! Mine 's Edith — it 's nicer , you see ; But yours does for you , for you 're plainer , though maybe you 're gooder than me ; For Jack says I 'm sometimes a devil , but Jack , of all folks , need n't talk , For I do n't call the seamstress an angel till Ma says the poor thing must “ walk . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Come in ! It 's quite dark in the parlor , for sister will keep the</l>
     <l n="2">blinds down ,</l>
     <l n="3">For you know her complexion is sallow like yours , but she is n't as</l>
     <l n="4">brown ;</l>
     <l n="5">Though Jack says that is n't the reason she likes to sit here with</l>
     <l n="6">Jim Moore .</l>
     <l n="7">Do you think that he meant that she kissed him ? Would you — if your</l>
     <l n="8">lips was n't sore ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>If you like , you can try our piano . ‘ Tai n't ours . A man left it here To rent by the month , although Ma says he has n't been paid for a year . Sister plays — oh , such fine variations !— why , I once heard a gentleman say That she did n't mind THAT for the music — in fact , it was just in her way !</p>
   <p>Ai n't I funny ? And yet it 's the queerest of all that , whatever I say , One half of the folks die a-laughing , and the rest , they all look t'other way . And some say , “ That child ! ” Do they ever say that to such people as you ? Though maybe you 're naturally silly , and that makes your eyes so askew .</p>
   <p>Now stop — do n't you dare to be crying ! Just as sure as you live , if you do , I 'll call in my big dog to bite you , and I 'll make my Papa kill you , too ! And then where 'll you be ? So play pretty . There 's my doll , and a nice piece of cake . You do n't want it — you think it is poison ! Then I 'LL eat it , dear , just for your sake !</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Why , when company comes , and they 're all speaking low ,</l>
     <l n="6">With their chairs drawn together , then some one says , “ Oh !</l>

    <head>NOTES</head>
    <p n="1">THE LOST GALLEON . As the custom on which the central incident of this legend is based may not be familiar to all readers , I will repeat here that it is the habit of navigators to drop a day from their calendar in crossing westerly the 180th degree of longitude of Greenwich , adding a day in coming east ; and that the idea of the lost galleon had an origin as prosaic as the log of the first China Mail Steamer from San Francisco . The explanation of the custom and its astronomical relations belongs rather to the usual text-books than to poetical narration . If any reader thinks I have overdrawn the credulous superstitions of the ancient navigators , I refer him to the veracious statements of Maldonado , De Fonte , the later voyages of La Perouse and Anson , and the charts of 1640 . In the charts of that day Spanish navigators reckoned longitude E. 360 degrees from the meridian of the Isle of Ferro . For the sake of perspicuity before a modern audience , the more recent meridian of Madrid was substituted . The custom of dropping a day at some arbitrary point in crossing the Pacific westerly , I need not say , remains unaffected by any change of meridian . I know not if any galleon was ever really missing . For two hundred and fifty years an annual trip was made between Acapulco and Manila . It may be some satisfaction to the more severely practical of my readers to know that , according to the best statistics of insurance , the loss during that period would be exactly three vessels and six hundredths of a vessel , which would certainly justify me in this summary disposition of ONE .</p>
    <p n="2">THE PLIOCENE SKULL . This extraordinary fossil is in the possession of Prof. Josiah D. Whitney , of the State Geological Survey of California . The poem was based on the following paragraph from the daily press of 1868 : “ A human skull has been found in California , in the pliocene formation . This skull is the remnant not only of the earliest pioneer of this State , but the oldest known human being .... The skull was found in a shaft 150 feet deep , two miles from Angels in Calaveras County , by a miner named James Watson , who gave it to Mr. Scribner , a merchant , who gave it to Dr. Jones , who sent it to the State Geological Survey .... The published volume of the State Survey of the Geology of California states that man existed here contemporaneously with the mastodon , but this fossil proves that he was here before the mastodon was known to exist . ”</p>
