   <p>II</p>
   <p>Bright and brief in the sight of grief and love the light of thy lifetime shone , Seen and felt by the gifts it dealt , the grace it gave , and again was gone : Ay , but now it is death , not thou , whom time has conquered as years pass on .</p>
   <p>Ay , not yet may the land forget that bore and loved thee and praised and wept , Sidney , lord of the stainless sword , the name of names that her heart 's love kept Fast as thine did her own , a sign to light thy life till it sank and slept .</p>
   <p>Bright as then for the souls of men thy brave Arcadia resounds and shines , Lit with love that beholds above all joys and sorrows the steadfast signs , Faith , a splendour that hope makes tender , and truth , whose presage the soul divines .</p>
   <p>All the glory that girds the story of all thy life as with sunlight round , All the spell that on all souls fell who saw thy spirit , and held them bound , Lives for all that have heard the call and cadence yet of its music sound .</p>
   <p>Music bright as the soul of light , for wings an eagle , for notes a dove , Leaps and shines from the lustrous lines wherethrough thy soul from afar above Shone and sang till the darkness rang with light whose fire is the fount of love .</p>
   <p>Love that led thee alive , and fed thy soul with sorrows and joys and fears , Love that sped thee , alive and dead , to fame 's fair goal with thy peerless peers , Feeds the flame of thy quenchless name with light that lightens the rayless years .</p>
   <p>Dark as sorrow though night and morrow may lower with presage of clouded fame , How may she that of old bare thee , may Sidney 's England , be brought to shame ? How should this be , while England is ? What need of answer beyond thy name ?</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>III</head>
     <l n="1">From the love that transfigures thy glory ,</l>
     <l n="2">From the light of the dawn of thy death ,</l>
     <l n="3">The life of thy song and thy story</l>
     <l n="4">Took subtler and fierier breath .</l>
     <l n="5">And we , though the day and the morrow</l>
     <l n="6">Set fear and thanksgiving at strife ,</l>
     <l n="7">Hail yet in the star of thy sorrow</l>
     <l n="8">The sun of thy life .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Shame and fear may beset men here , and bid thanksgiving and pride be dumb : Faith , discrowned of her praise , and wound about with toils till her life wax numb , Scarce may see if the sundawn be , if darkness die not and dayrise come .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">But England , enmeshed and benetted</l>
     <l n="2">With spiritless villainies round ,</l>
     <l n="3">With counsels of cowardice fretted ,</l>
     <l n="4">With trammels of treason enwound ,</l>
     <l n="5">Is yet , though the season be other</l>
     <l n="6">Than wept and rejoiced over thee ,</l>
     <l n="7">Thine England , thy lover , thy mother ,</l>
     <l n="8">Sublime as the sea .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Hers wast thou : if her face be now less bright , or seem for an hour less brave , Let but thine on her darkness shine , thy saviour spirit revive and save , Time shall see , as the shadows flee , her shame entombed in a shameful grave .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">If death and not life were the portal</l>
     <l n="2">That opens on life at the last ,</l>
     <l n="3">If the spirit of Sidney were mortal</l>
     <l n="4">And the past of it utterly past ,</l>
     <l n="5">Fear stronger than honour was ever ,</l>
     <l n="6">Forgetfulness mightier than fame ,</l>
     <l n="7">Faith knows not if England should never</l>
     <l n="8">Subside into shame .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Yea , but yet is thy sun not set , thy sunbright spirit of trust withdrawn : England 's love of thee burns above all hopes that darken or fears that fawn : Hers thou art : and the faithful heart that hopes begets upon darkness dawn .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The sunset that sunrise will follow</l>
     <l n="2">Is less than the dream of a dream :</l>
     <l n="3">The starshine on height and on hollow</l>
     <l n="4">Sheds promise that dawn shall redeem :</l>
     <l n="5">The night , if the daytime would hide it ,</l>
     <l n="6">Shows lovelier , aflame and afar ,</l>
     <l n="7">Thy soul and thy Stella 's beside it ,</l>
     <l n="8">A star by a star .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Summer , and noon , and a splendour of silence , felt ,</l>
     <l n="2">Seen , and heard of the spirit within the sense .</l>
     <l n="3">Soft through the frondage the shades of the sunbeams melt ,</l>
     <l n="4">Sharp through the foliage the shafts of them , keen and dense ,</l>
     <l n="5">Cleave , as discharged from the string of the God 's bow , tense</l>
     <l n="6">As a war-steed 's girth , and bright as a warrior 's belt .</l>
     <l n="7">Ah , why should an hour that is heaven for an hour pass hence ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">I dare not sleep for delight of the perfect hour ,</l>
     <l n="9">Lest God be wroth that his gift should be scorned of man .</l>
     <l n="10">The face of the warm bright world is the face of a flower ,</l>
     <l n="11">The word of the wind and the leaves that the light winds fan</l>
     <l n="12">As the word that quickened at first into flame , and ran ,</l>
     <l n="13">Creative and subtle and fierce with invasive power ,</l>
     <l n="14">Through darkness and cloud , from the breath of the one God , Pan .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">The perfume of earth possessed by the sun pervades</l>
     <l n="16">The chaster air that he soothes but with sense of sleep .</l>
     <l n="17">Soft , imminent , strong as desire that prevails and fades ,</l>
     <l n="18">The passing noon that beholds not a cloudlet weep</l>
     <l n="19">Imbues and impregnates life with delight more deep</l>
     <l n="20">Than dawn or sunset or moonrise on lawns or glades</l>
     <l n="21">Can shed from the skies that receive it and may not keep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="22">The skies may hold not the splendour of sundown fast ;</l>
     <l n="23">It wanes into twilight as dawn dies down into day .</l>
     <l n="24">And the moon , triumphant when twilight is overpast ,</l>
     <l n="25">Takes pride but awhile in the hours of her stately sway .</l>
     <l n="26">But the might of the noon , though the light of it pass away ,</l>
     <l n="27">Leaves earth fulfilled of desires and of dreams that last ;</l>
     <l n="28">But if any there be that hath sense of them none can say .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="29">For if any there be that hath sight of them , sense , or trust</l>
     <l n="30">Made strong by the might of a vision , the strength of a dream ,</l>
     <l n="31">His lips shall straiten and close as a dead man 's must ,</l>
     <l n="32">His heart shall be sealed as the voice of a frost-bound stream .</l>
     <l n="33">For the deep mid mystery of light and of heat that seem</l>
     <l n="34">To clasp and pierce dark earth , and enkindle dust ,</l>
     <l n="35">Shall a man 's faith say what it is ? or a man 's guess deem ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="36">Sleep lies not heavier on eyes that have watched all night</l>
     <l n="37">Than hangs the heat of the noon on the hills and trees .</l>
     <l n="38">Why now should the haze not open , and yield to sight</l>
     <l n="39">A fairer secret than hope or than slumber sees ?</l>
     <l n="40">I seek not heaven with submission of lips and knees ,</l>
     <l n="41">With worship and prayer for a sign till it leap to light :</l>
     <l n="42">I gaze on the gods about me , and call on these .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="43">I call on the gods hard by , the divine dim powers</l>
     <l n="44">Whose likeness is here at hand , in the breathless air ,</l>
     <l n="45">In the pulseless peace of the fervid and silent flowers ,</l>
     <l n="46">In the faint sweet speech of the waters that whisper there .</l>
     <l n="47">Ah , what should darkness do in a world so fair ?</l>
     <l n="48">The bent-grass heaves not , the couch-grass quails not or cowers ;</l>
     <l n="49">The wind 's kiss frets not the rowan 's or aspen 's hair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="50">But the silence trembles with passion of sound suppressed ,</l>
     <l n="51">And the twilight quivers and yearns to the sunward , wrung</l>
     <l n="52">With love as with pain ; and the wide wood 's motionless breast</l>
     <l n="53">Is thrilled with a dumb desire that would fain find tongue</l>
     <l n="54">And palpitates , tongueless as she whom a man-snake stung ,</l>
     <l n="55">Whose heart now heaves in the nightingale , never at rest</l>
     <l n="56">Nor satiated ever with song till her last be sung .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="57">Is it rapture or terror that circles me round , and invades</l>
     <l n="58">Each vein of my life with hope — if it be not fear ?</l>
     <l n="59">Each pulse that awakens my blood into rapture fades ,</l>
     <l n="60">Each pulse that subsides into dread of a strange thing near</l>
     <l n="61">Requickens with sense of a terror less dread than dear .</l>
     <l n="62">Is peace not one with light in the deep green glades</l>
     <l n="63">Where summer at noonday slumbers ? Is peace not here ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="64">The tall thin stems of the firs , and the roof sublime</l>
     <l n="65">That screens from the sun the floor of the steep still wood ,</l>
     <l n="66">Deep , silent , splendid , and perfect and calm as time ,</l>
     <l n="67">Stand fast as ever in sight of the night they stood ,</l>
     <l n="68">When night gave all that moonlight and dewfall could .</l>
     <l n="69">The dense ferns deepen , the moss glows warm as the thyme :</l>
     <l n="70">The wild heath quivers about me : the world is good .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="71">Is it Pan 's breath , fierce in the tremulous maidenhair ,</l>
     <l n="72">That bids fear creep as a snake through the woodlands , felt</l>
     <l n="73">In the leaves that it stirs not yet , in the mute bright air ,</l>
     <l n="74">In the stress of the sun ? For here has the great God dwelt :</l>
     <l n="75">For hence were the shafts of his love or his anger dealt .</l>
     <l n="76">For here has his wrath been fierce as his love was fair ,</l>
     <l n="77">When each was as fire to the darkness its breath bade melt .</l>
    </lg>

   <p>ON THE SOUTH COAST</p>
   <p>TO THEODORE WATTS</p>
   <p>Hills and valleys where April rallies his radiant squadron of flowers and birds , Steep strange beaches and lustrous reaches of fluctuant sea that the land engirds , Fields and downs that the sunrise crowns with life diviner than lives in words ,</p>
   <p>Day by day of resurgent May salute the sun with sublime acclaim , Change and brighten with hours that lighten and darken , girdled with cloud or flame ; Earth 's fair face in alternate grace beams , blooms , and lowers , and is yet the same .</p>
   <p>Twice each day the divine sea 's play makes glad with glory that comes and goes Field and street that her waves keep sweet , when past the bounds of their old repose , Fast and fierce in renewed reverse , the foam-flecked estuary ebbs and flows .</p>
   <p>Broad and bold through the stays of old staked fast with trunks of the wildwood tree , Up from shoreward , impelled far forward , by marsh and meadow , by lawn and lea , Inland still at her own wild will swells , rolls , and revels the surging sea .</p>
   <p>Strong as time , and as faith sublime ,— clothed round with shadows of hopes and fears , Nights and morrows , and joys and sorrows , alive with passion of prayers and tears ,— Stands the shrine that has seen decline eight hundred waxing and waning years .</p>
   <p>Tower set square to the storms of air and change of season that glooms and glows , Wall and roof of it tempest-proof , and equal ever to suns and snows , Bright with riches of radiant niches and pillars smooth as a straight stem grows .</p>
   <p>Aisle and nave that the whelming wave of time has whelmed not or touched or neared , Arch and vault without stain or fault , by hands of craftsmen we know not reared , Time beheld them , and time was quelled ; and change passed by them as one that feared .</p>
   <p>Time that flies as a dream , and dies as dreams that die with the sleep they feed , Here alone in a garb of stone incarnate stands as a god indeed , Stern and fair , and of strength to bear all burdens mortal to man 's frail seed .</p>
   <p>Men and years are as leaves or tears that storm or sorrow is fain to shed : These go by as the winds that sigh , and none takes note of them quick or dead : Time , whose breath is their birth and death , folds here his pinions , and bows his head .</p>
   <p>Still the sun that beheld begun the work wrought here of unwearied hands Sees , as then , though the Red King 's men held ruthless rule over lawless lands , Stand their massive design , impassive , pure and proud as a virgin stands .</p>
   <p>Statelier still as the years fulfil their count , subserving her sacred state , Grows the hoary grey church whose story silence utters and age makes great : Statelier seems it than shines in dreams the face unveiled of unvanquished fate .</p>
   <p>Fate , more high than the star-shown sky , more deep than waters unsounded , shines Keen and far as the final star on souls that seek not for charms or signs ; Yet more bright is the love-shown light of men 's hands lighted in songs or shrines .</p>
   <p>Love and trust that the grave 's deep dust can soil not , neither may fear put out , Witness yet that their record set stands fast , though years be as hosts in rout , Spent and slain ; but the signs remain that beat back darkness and cast forth doubt .</p>
   <p>Men that wrought by the grace of thought and toil things goodlier than praise dare trace , Fair as all that the world may call most fair , save only the sea 's own face , Shrines or songs that the world 's change wrongs not , live by grace of their own gift 's grace .</p>
   <p>Dead , their names that the night reclaims — alive , their works that the day relumes — Sink and stand , as in stone and sand engraven : none may behold their tombs : Nights and days shall record their praise while here this flower of their grafting blooms .</p>
   <p>Flower more fair than the sun-thrilled air bids laugh and lighten and wax and rise , Fruit more bright than the fervent light sustains with strength from the kindled skies , Flower and fruit that the deathless root of man 's love rears though the man 's name dies .</p>
   <p>Stately stands it , the work of hands unknown of : statelier , afar and near , Rise around it the heights that bound our landward gaze from the seaboard here ; Downs that swerve and aspire , in curve and change of heights that the dawn holds dear .</p>
   <p>Dawn falls fair on the grey walls there confronting dawn , on the low green lea , Lone and sweet as for fairies ’ feet held sacred , silent and strange and free , Wild and wet with its rills ; but yet more fair falls dawn on the fairer sea .</p>
   <p>Eastward , round by the high green bound of hills that fold the remote fields in , Strive and shine on the low sea-line fleet waves and beams when the days begin ; Westward glow , when the days burn low , the sun that yields and the stars that win .</p>
   <p>Rose-red eve on the seas that heave sinks fair as dawn when the first ray peers ; Winds are glancing from sunbright Lancing to Shoreham , crowned with the grace of years ; Shoreham , clad with the sunset , glad and grave with glory that death reveres .</p>
   <p>Death , more proud than the kings ’ heads bowed before him , stronger than all things , bows Here his head : as if death were dead , and kingship plucked from his crownless brows , Life hath here such a face of cheer as change appals not and time avows .</p>
   <p>Skies fulfilled with the sundown , stilled and splendid , spread as a flower that spreads , Pave with rarer device and fairer than heaven 's the luminous oyster-beds , Grass-embanked , and in square plots ranked , inlaid with gems that the sundown sheds .</p>
   <p>Squares more bright and with lovelier light than heaven that kindled it shines with shine Warm and soft as the dome aloft , but heavenlier yet than the sun 's own shrine : Heaven is high , but the water-sky lit here seems deeper and more divine .</p>
   <p>Flowers on flowers , that the whole world 's bowers may show not , here may the sunset show , Lightly graven in the waters paven with ghostly gold by the clouds aglow : Bright as love is the vault above , but lovelier lightens the wave below .</p>
   <p>Rosy grey , or as fiery spray full-plumed , or greener than emerald , gleams Plot by plot as the skies allot for each its glory , divine as dreams Lit with fire of appeased desire which sounds the secret of all that seems ;</p>
   <p>Dreams that show what we fain would know , and know not save by the grace of sleep , Sleep whose hands have removed the bands that eyes long waking and fain to weep Feel fast bound on them — light around them strange , and darkness above them steep .</p>
   <p>Yet no vision that heals division of love from love , and renews awhile Life and breath in the lips where death has quenched the spirit of speech and smile , Shows on earth , or in heaven 's mid mirth , where no fears enter or doubts defile ,</p>
   <p>Aught more fair than the radiant air and water here by the twilight wed , Here made one by the waning sun whose last love quickens to rosebright red Half the crown of the soft high down that rears to northward its wood-girt head .</p>
   <p>There , when day is at height of sway , men 's eyes who stand , as we oft have stood , High where towers with its world of flowers the golden spinny that flanks the wood , See before and around them shore and seaboard glad as their gifts are good .</p>
   <p>Higher and higher to the north aspire the green smooth-swelling unending downs ; East and west on the brave earth 's breast glow girdle-jewels of gleaming towns ; Southward shining , the lands declining subside in peace that the sea 's light crowns .</p>
   <p>Westward wide in its fruitful pride the plain lies lordly with plenteous grace ; Fair as dawn 's when the fields and lawns desire her glitters the glad land 's face : Eastward yet is the sole sign set of elder days and a lordlier race .</p>
   <p>Down beneath us afar , where seethe in wilder weather the tides aflow , Hurled up hither and drawn down thither in quest of rest that they may not know , Still as dew on a flower the blue broad stream now sleeps in the fields below .</p>
   <p>Mild and bland in the fair green land it smiles , and takes to its heart the sky ; Scarce the meads and the fens , the reeds and grasses , still as they stand or lie , Wear the palm of a statelier calm than rests on waters that pass them by .</p>
   <p>Yet shall these , when the winds and seas of equal days and coequal nights Rage , rejoice , and uplift a voice whose sound is even as a sword that smites , Felt and heard as a doomsman 's word from seaward reaches to landward heights ,</p>
   <p>Lift their heart up , and take their part of triumph , swollen and strong with rage , Rage elate with desire and great with pride that tempest and storm assuage ; So their chime in the ear of time has rung from age to rekindled age .</p>
   <p>Fair and dear is the land 's face here , and fair man 's work as a man 's may be : Dear and fair as the sunbright air is here the record that speaks him free ; Free by birth of a sacred earth , and regent ever of all the sea .</p>

      <l n="206">Full-fraught from heaven , intense and imminent ,</l>
      <l n="207">To depths wherein the seething strengths of cloud</l>
      <l n="208">Scarce matched the wrath of waves whereon they bowed ,</l>
      <l n="209">From homeborn pride and kindling love of home</l>
      <l n="210">To the outer skies and seas of fire and foam ,</l>
      <l n="211">From splendour soft as dew that sundawn thrills</l>
      <l n="212">To gloom that shudders round the world it fills ,</l>
      <l n="213">From midnights murmuring round Titania 's ear</l>
      <l n="214">To midnights maddening round the rage of Lear ,</l>
      <l n="215">The wonder woven of storm and sun became</l>
      <l n="216">One with the light that lightens from his name .</l>
      <l n="217">The music moving on the sea that felt</l>
      <l n="218">The storm-wind even as snows of springtide melt</l>
      <l n="219">Was blithe as Ariel 's hand or voice might make</l>
      <l n="220">And bid all grief die gladly for its sake .</l>
      <l n="221">And there the soul alive in ear and eye</l>
      <l n="222">That watched the wonders of an hour pass by</l>
      <l n="223">Saw brighter than all stars that heaven inspheres</l>
      <l n="224">The silent splendour of Cordelia 's tears ,</l>
      <l n="225">Felt in the whispers of the quickening wind</l>
      <l n="226">The radiance of the laugh of Rosalind ,</l>
      <l n="227">And heard , in sounds that melt the souls of men</l>
      <l n="228">With love of love , the tune of Imogen .</l>

   <p>VII</p>
   <p>For the strong north-east is not strong to subdue and to slay the divine south-west , And the darkness is less than the light that it darkens , and dies in reluctant rest . It hovers and hangs on the labouring and trembling ascent of the dawn from the deep , Till the sun 's eye quicken the world and the waters , and smite it again into sleep . Night , holy and starry , the fostress of souls , with the fragrance of heaven in her breath , Subdues with the sense of her godhead the forces and mysteries of sorrow and death . Eternal as dawn 's is the comfort she gives : but the mist that beleaguers and slays Comes , passes , and is not : the strength of it withers , appalled or assuaged by the day 's . Faith , haggard as Fear that had borne her , and dark as the sire that begat her , Despair , Held rule on the soul of the world and the song of it saddening through ages that were ; Dim centuries that darkened and brightened and darkened again , and the soul of their song Was great as their grief , and sublime as their suffering , and strong as their sorrows were strong . It knew not , it saw not , but shadows triune , and evoked by the strength of their spell Dark hell , and the mountain of anguish , and heaven that was hollower and harder than hell . These are not : the womb of the darkness that bare them rejects them , and knows them no more : Thought , fettered in misery and iron , revives in the light that it lived in of yore . For the soul that is wisdom and freedom , the spirit of England redeemed from her past , Speaks life through the lips of the master and lord of her children , the first and the last . Thought , touched by his hand and redeemed by his breath , sees , hears , and accepts from above The limitless lightnings of vision and passion , the measureless music of love .</p>

     <l n="42">All the rage of all the unbaffled wave that breaks and falls .</l>
     <l n="43">Who shall thwart the madness and the gladness of it , laden</l>
     <l n="44">Full with heavy fate , and joyous as the birds that whirl ?</l>

     <l n="64">Yet beyond their helpless hearing , out of hopeless sight ,</l>

     <l n="85">Children worthier all the birthright given of the ardent north</l>
     <l n="86">Where the fire of hearts outburns the suns that fire the south .</l>

   <p>ENGLAND : AN ODE</p>
    <p>I</p>
   <p>Sea and strand , and a lordlier land than sea-tides rolling and rising sun Clasp and lighten in climes that brighten with day when day that was here is done , Call aloud on their children , proud with trust that future and past are one .</p>
   <p>Far and near from the swan 's nest here the storm-birds bred of her fair white breast , Sons whose home was the sea-wave 's foam , have borne the fame of her east and west ; North and south has the storm-wind 's mouth rung praise of England and England 's quest .</p>
   <p>Fame , wherever her flag flew , never forbore to fly with an equal wing : France and Spain with their warrior train bowed down before her as thrall to king ; India knelt at her feet , and felt her sway more fruitful of life than spring .</p>
   <p>Darkness round them as iron bound fell off from races of elder name , Slain at sight of her eyes , whose light bids freedom lighten and burn as flame ; Night endures not the touch that cures of kingship tyrants , and slaves of shame .</p>
   <p>All the terror of time , where error and fear were lords of a world of slaves , Age on age in resurgent rage and anguish darkening as waves on waves , Fell or fled from a face that shed such grace as quickens the dust of graves .</p>
   <p>Things of night at her glance took flight : the strengths of darkness recoiled and sank : Sank the fires of the murderous pyres whereon wild agony writhed and shrank : Rose the light of the reign of right from gulfs of years that the darkness drank .</p>
   <p>Yet the might of her wings in flight , whence glory lightens and music rings , Loud and bright as the dawn 's , shall smite and still the discord of evil things , Yet not slain by her radiant reign , but darkened now by her sail-stretched wings .</p>
   <p>II</p>
   <p>Music made of change and conquest , glory born of evil slain , Stilled the discord , slew the darkness , bade the lights of tempest wane , Where the deathless dawn of England rose in sign that right should reign .</p>
   <p>Mercy , where the tiger wallowed mad and blind with blood and lust , Justice , where the jackal yelped and fed , and slaves allowed it just , Rose as England 's light on Asia rose , and smote them down to dust .</p>
   <p>Justice bright as mercy , mercy girt by justice with her sword , Smote and saved and raised and ruined , till the tyrant-ridden horde Saw the lightning fade from heaven and knew the sun for God and lord .</p>
   <p>Where the footfall sounds of England , where the smile of England shines , Rings the tread and laughs the face of freedom , fair as hope divines Days to be , more brave than ours and lit by lordlier stars for signs .</p>
   <p>All our past acclaims our future : Shakespeare 's voice and Nelson 's hand , Milton 's faith and Wordsworth 's trust in this our chosen and chainless land , Bear us witness : come the world against her , England yet shall stand .</p>
   <p>Earth and sea bear England witness if he lied who said it ; he Whom the winds that ward her , waves that clasp , and herb and flower and tree Fed with English dews and sunbeams , hail as more than man may be .</p>
   <p>No man ever spake as he that bade our England be but true , Keep but faith with England fast and firm , and none should bid her rue ; None may speak as he : but all may know the sign that Shakespeare knew .</p>
   <p>III</p>
   <p>From the springs of the dawn , from the depths of the noon , from the heights of the night that shine , Hope , faith , and remembrance of glory that found but in England her throne and her shrine , Speak louder than song may proclaim them , that here is the seal of them set for a sign .</p>
   <p>And loud as the sea 's voice thunders applause of the land that is one with the sea Speaks Time in the ear of the people that never at heart was not inly free The word of command that assures us of life , if we will but that life shall be ;</p>
   <p>If the race that is first of the races of men who behold unashamed the sun Stand fast and forget not the sign that is given of the years and the wars that are done , The token that all who are born of its blood should in heart as in blood be one .</p>
   <p>The word of remembrance that lightens as fire from the steeps of the storm-lit past Bids only the faith of our fathers endure in us , firm as they held it fast : That the glory which was from the first upon England alone may endure to the last .</p>
   <p>That the love and the hate may change not , the faith may not fade , nor the wrath nor scorn , That shines for her sons and that burns for her foemen as fire of the night or the morn : That the births of her womb may forget not the sign of the glory wherein they were born .</p>
   <p>A light that is more than the sunlight , an air that is brighter than morning 's breath , Clothes England about as the strong sea clasps her , and answers the word that it saith ; The word that assures her of life if she change not , and choose not the ways of death .</p>
   <p>Change darkens and lightens around her , alternate in hope and in fear to be : Hope knows not if fear speak truth , nor fear whether hope be not blind as she : But the sun is in heaven that beholds her immortal , and girdled with life by the sea .</p>

    <head>ETON : AN ODE</head>
     <l n="1">FOR THE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDATION</l>
     <l n="2">OF THE COLLEGE</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I</p>
   <p>Four hundred summers and fifty have shone on the meadows of Thames and died Since Eton arose in an age that was darkness , and shone by his radiant side As a star that the spell of a wise man 's word bade live and ascend and abide .</p>
   <p>And ever as time 's flow brightened , a river more dark than the storm-clothed sea , And age upon age rose fairer and larger in promise of hope set free , With England Eton her child kept pace as a fostress of men to be .</p>
   <p>And ever as earth waxed wiser , and softer the beating of time 's wide wings , Since fate fell dark on her father , most hapless and gentlest of star-crossed kings , Her praise has increased as the chant of the dawn that the choir of the noon outsings .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>II</head>
    <head>Storm and cloud in the skies were loud , and lightning mocked at the blind sun 's light ; War and woe on the land below shed heavier shadow than falls from night ; Dark was earth at her dawn of birth as here her record of praise is bright .</head>
     <l n="1">Clear and fair through her morning air the light first laugh of the</l>
     <l n="2">sunlit stage</l>
     <l n="3">Rose and rang as a fount that sprang from depths yet dark with a</l>
     <l n="4">spent storm 's rage ,</l>
     <l n="5">Loud and glad as a boy 's , and bade the sunrise open on</l>
     <l n="6">Shakespeare 's age .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Lords of state and of war , whom fate found strong in battle , in counsel strong , Here , ere fate had approved them great , abode their season , and thought not long : Here too first was the lark 's note nursed that filled and flooded the skies with song .</p>
   <p>III</p>
   <p>Shelley , lyric lord of England 's lordliest singers , here first heard Ring from lips of poets crowned and dead the Promethean word Whence his soul took fire , and power to outsoar the sunward-soaring bird .</p>
   <p>Still the reaches of the river , still the light on field and hill , Still the memories held aloft as lamps for hope 's young fire to fill , Shine , and while the light of England lives shall shine for England still .</p>
   <p>When four hundred more and fifty years have risen and shone and set , Bright with names that men remember , loud with names that men forget , Haply here shall Eton 's record be what England finds it yet .</p>

   <p>BIRTHDAY ODE</p>
   <p>AUGUST 6 , 1891</p>
    <p>I</p>
   <p>Love and praise , and a length of days whose shadow cast upon time is light , Days whose sound was a spell shed round from wheeling wings as of doves in flight , Meet in one , that the mounting sun to-day may triumph , and cast out night .</p>
   <p>Two years more than the full fourscore lay hallowing hands on a sacred head — Scarce one score of the perfect four uncrowned of fame as they smiled and fled : Still and soft and alive aloft their sunlight stays though the suns be dead .</p>
   <p>Ere we were or were thought on , ere the love that gave us to life began , Fame grew strong with his crescent song , to greet the goal of the race they ran , Song with fame , and the lustrous name with years whose changes acclaimed the man .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>II</head>
     <l n="1">Soon , ere time in the rounding rhyme of choral seasons had hailed</l>
     <l n="2">us men ,</l>
     <l n="3">We too heard and acclaimed the word whose breath was life upon</l>
     <l n="4">England then —</l>
     <l n="5">Life more bright than the breathless light of soundless noon in a</l>
     <l n="6">songless glen .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Ah , the joy of the heartstruck boy whose ear was opened of love to hear ! Ah , the bliss of the burning kiss of song and spirit , the mounting cheer Lit with fire of divine desire and love that knew not if love were fear !</p>
   <p>Fear and love as of heaven above and earth enkindled of heaven were one ; One white flame , that around his name grew keen and strong as the worldwide sun ; Awe made bright with implied delight , as weft with weft of the rainbow spun .</p>
   <p>III</p>
   <p>He that fears not the voice he hears and loves shall never have heart to sing : All the grace of the sun-god 's face that bids the soul as a fountain spring Bids the brow that receives it bow , and hail his likeness on earth as king .</p>
   <p>We that knew when the sun 's shaft flew beheld and worshipped , adored and heard : Light rang round it of shining sound , whence all men 's hearts were subdued and stirred : Joy , love , sorrow , the day , the morrow , took life upon them in one man 's word .</p>
   <p>Not for him can the years wax dim , nor downward swerve on a darkening way : Upward wind they , and leave behind such light as lightens the front of May : Fair as youth and sublime as truth we find the fame that we hail to-day .</p>

   <p>Life , sublime and serene when time had power upon it and ruled its breath , Changed it , bade it be glad or sad , and hear what change in the world 's ear saith , Shines more fair in the starrier air whose glory lightens the dusk of death .</p>
   <p>Suns that sink on the wan sea 's brink , and moons that kindle and flame and fade , Leave more clear for the darkness here the stars that set not and see not shade Rise and rise on the lowlier skies by rule of sunlight and moonlight swayed .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">So , when night for his eyes grew bright , his proud head pillowed on</l>
     <l n="2">Shakespeare 's breast ,</l>
     <l n="3">Hand in hand with him , soon to stand where shine the glories that</l>
     <l n="4">death loves best ,</l>
     <l n="5">Passed the light of his face from sight , and sank sublimely to</l>
     <l n="6">radiant rest .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>II</p>
   <p>Far above us and all our love , beyond all reach of its voiceless praise , Shines for ever the name that never shall feel the shade of the changeful days Fall and chill the delight that still sees winter 's light on it shine like May 's .</p>
   <p>Strong as death is the dark day 's breath whose blast has withered the life we see Here where light is the child of night , and less than visions or dreams are we : Strong as death ; but a word , a breath , a dream is stronger than death can be .</p>
   <p>Strong as truth and superb in youth eternal , fair as the sundawn 's flame Seen when May on her first-born day bids earth exult in her radiant name , Lives , clothed round with its praise and crowned with love that dies not , his love-lit fame .</p>
   <p>III</p>
   <p>Fairer far than the morning star , and sweet for us as the songs that rang Loud through heaven from the choral Seven when all the stars of the morning sang , Shines the song that we loved so long — since first such love in us flamed and sprang .</p>
   <p>England glows as a sunlit rose from mead to mountain , from sea to sea , Bright with love and with pride above all taint of sorrow that needs must be , Needs must live for an hour , and give its rainbow 's glory to lawn and lea .</p>
   <p>Not through tears shall the new-born years behold him , crowned with applause of men , Pass at last from a lustrous past to life that lightens beyond their ken , Glad and dead , and from earthward led to sunward , guided of Imogen .</p>

     <l n="101">Sound back to the surge of the tides ,</l>
     <l n="102">Till sons of the sons of the Norsemen</l>
