    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">Arthur Macy was a Nantucket boy of Quaker extraction . His name alone is evidence of this , for it is safe to say that a Macy , wherever found in the United States , is descended from that sturdy old Quaker who was one of those who bought Nantucket from the Indians , paid them fairly for it , treated them with justice , and lived on friendly terms with them . In many ways Arthur Macy showed that he was a Nantucketer and , at least by descent , a Quaker . He often used phrases peculiar to our island in the sea , and was given , in conversation at least , to similes which smacked of salt water . Almost the last time I saw him he said , “ I 'm coming round soon for a good long gam . ”</p>
    <p n="2">He was a many-sided man . In his intercourse with a friend like myself he would show the side which he thought would interest me , and that only . He was above all things cheery , and , to his praise be it said , he hated a bore . I remember that a mutual friend was talking baseball to me by the yard . Arthur was sitting by , listening . It was a subject in which he was much interested . Nevertheless , turning to our mutual friend , he said , “ Do n't talk baseball to him . He do n't care anything about it , he do n't know anything about it , and he do n't want to . ” On the other hand , although little given to telling of his war experiences , he was always ready to talk over the old days with me . Of what he did himself , he modestly said but little , but of the services of others , more especially of the men in the ranks , he was generous in his praise .</p>
    <p n="3">Early in the war Macy enlisted in Company B , 24th Michigan Volunteer Infantry . He was twice wounded on the first day at Gettysburg , and managed to crawl into the town and get as far as the steps of the Court House , which was fast filling with wounded from both sides . His sense of humor was in evidence even at such a time . A Confederate officer rode up and asked , “ Have those men in there got arms ? ” Quick as a flash Macy answered : “ Some of them have and some of them have n't . ” He remained in this Court-House hospital , a prisoner within the Confederate lines , until the battle was over and Lee 's army retreated . All wounded prisoners who could walk were forced to go with them , but Macy 's wound was in the foot , and , fortunately for him , he was spared the horrors of a Southern prison .</p>
    <p n="4">He was on duty later at the Naval Academy Hospital in Annapolis , presided over by Dr. Vanderkieft , perhaps as efficient a general hospital administrator as the army had . I knew Dr. Vanderkieft very well , and was on duty at his hospital when the exchanged prisoners came back from Andersonville . Although Macy and I never met there , it came out in our talk that we were there at the same time . He served his full three years , and was honorably discharged about the close of the war .</p>
    <p n="5">It is given to but few to have the keen sense of humor which he possessed . Quick and keen at repartee , he never practised it save when worth while . He never said the clearly obvious thing . Failing something better than that , he held his peace .</p>
    <p n="6">Had it not been for his disinclination to publish his verses , he long ago would have had a national reputation . His reason for this disinclination , as I gathered from many talks with him , was that he did not consider his work of sufficiently high poetic standard . Every one praised his choice of words , his wonderful facility in rhyme , the perfection of his metre , and the daintiness and delicacy of his verse . “ All right , ” he would say , “ but that is not Poetry with a big P , and that is the only kind that should be published . And there is mighty little of it . ” It is fortunate that this severe judgment , creditable as it was to him , is not to prevail . Lovers of the beautiful are not to be robbed of “ Sit Closer , Friends , ” nor of “ A Poet 's Lesson , ” and many who never heard of that remarkable Spanish pachyderm will take delight in the story of “ The Rollicking Mastodon , ” whose home was “ in the trunk of a Tranquil Tree . ” The greater part of his verses with which I am familiar I heard at Papyrus Club dinners . He was an early member , and one of the most esteemed . He was fairly sure to have something in his pocket , and the presiding officer never called upon him in vain .</p>
    <p n="7">It was so at the Saint Botolph Club , of which he was long a member . Whenever there was an “ occasion ” when the need of verse seemed indicated , Arthur Macy could be counted on . His “ Saint Botolph , ” which has become the Club song , and will be sung as long as the Club endures , was written for a Twelfth Night revel at my request . It has a peculiarly old English flavor . He makes of the Saint , not the jolly friar nor yet the severe recluse , but just a good , kind old man who “ was loved by the sinners and loved by the good , ” one who was certain that there must be sin so long as</p>
    <p n="8">“ A few get the loaves and many get the crumbs , And some are born fingers and some are born thumbs . ”</p>
    <p n="9">And here we get a glimpse of Arthur Macy 's view of life , which was certainly broad and generous , with a philosophic flavor .</p>
    <p n="10">Arthur Macy had a business side of which his Club intimates had but slight knowledge . He represented , in New England , one of the great commercial agencies of the country . His knowledge of business men , of their standing , commercially and financially , was extended and intimate , and was relied upon by our merchants and others as a basis for giving credit . His office work required the closest attention to details and the exercise of the most careful judgment . The whole success of such a company as that which he represented depends upon the reliability of the information which it gives . Without this it has no reason for existence . It was to Arthur Macy that the merchants of Boston largely turned for information concerning their customers scattered throughout New England , and it was because of his success in obtaining such information and his thorough knowledge of the business in all its details that the superior officers of the company placed such implicit confidence in his judgment and so high a value upon his advice . And in the conduct of this business he showed his Quaker straightforwardness . His work was not at all of the “ detective ” sort . If information was wanted concerning a man 's business by those who had dealings with him , Macy went directly to the man himself , and told him that it was for his own best interest to show just where he stood , and , above all things , to tell the exact truth . Honest men had the truth told about them , and profited by it . Dishonest men and secretive men were passed over in severe silence , and their credit suffered accordingly . Few of those who sought Arthur Macy for business information ever suspected that they were talking to a poet and man of letters .</p>
    <p n="11">I have not sought to tell Arthur Macy 's life story . Neither have I entered upon any detailed consideration of his verse . It is for the reader to peruse the pages that follow and draw his own conclusion . I have merely tried to give a glimpse of the characteristics of one of the most charming personalities I ever knew .</p>

     <l n="1">A Rollicking Mastodon lived in Spain ,</l>
     <l n="2">In the trunk of a Tranquil Tree .</l>
     <l n="3">His face was plain , but his jocular vein</l>
     <l n="4">Was a burst of the wildest glee .</l>
     <l n="5">His voice was strong and his laugh so long</l>
     <l n="6">That people came many a mile ,</l>
     <l n="7">And offered to pay a guinea a day</l>
     <l n="8">For the fractional part of a smile .</l>
     <l n="9">The Rollicking Mastodon 's laugh was wide —</l>
     <l n="10">Indeed , ‘ twas a matter of family pride ;</l>
     <l n="11">And oh ! so proud of his jocular vein</l>
     <l n="12">Was the Rollicking Mastodon over in Spain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">The Rollicking Mastodon said one day ,</l>

     <l n="16">As well as a gloss for the hair . ”</l>
     <l n="17">So he skipped along and warbled a song</l>
     <l n="18">In his own triumphulant way .</l>
     <l n="19">His smile was bright and his skip was light</l>
     <l n="20">As he chirruped his roundelay .</l>
     <l n="21">The Rollicking Mastodon tripped along ,</l>
     <l n="22">And sang what Mastodons call a song ;</l>
     <l n="23">But every note of it seemed to pain</l>
     <l n="24">The Rollicking Mastodon over in Spain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="25">A Little Peetookle came over the hill ,</l>

     <l n="28">And a little advice for your throat . ”</l>
     <l n="29">The Mastodon smiled and said , “ My child ,</l>
     <l n="30">There 's a chance for your taste to grow .</l>
     <l n="31">If you polish your mind , you 'll certainly find</l>

     <l n="33">The Little Peetookle , his teeth he ground</l>
     <l n="34">At the Mastodon 's singular sense of sound ;</l>
     <l n="35">For he felt it a sort of musical stain</l>
     <l n="36">On the Rollicking Mastodon over in Spain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="37">“ Alas ! and alas ! has it come to this pass ? ”</l>

     <l n="39">It certainly seems your horrible screams</l>
     <l n="40">Intended for music must be . ”</l>
     <l n="41">The Mastodon stopped ; his ditty he dropped ,</l>
     <l n="42">And murmured , “ Good-morning , my dear !</l>
     <l n="43">I never will sing to a sensitive thing</l>
     <l n="44">That shatters a song with a sneer ! ”</l>
     <l n="45">The Rollicking Mastodon bade him “ adieu . ”</l>
     <l n="46">Of course , ‘ twas a sensible thing to do ;</l>
