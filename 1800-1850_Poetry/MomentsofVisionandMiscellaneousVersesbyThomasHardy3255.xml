       <l n="1">Forty Augusts — aye , and several more — ago ,</l>
       <l n="2">When I paced the headlands loosed from dull employ ,</l>
       <l n="3">The waves huzza 'd like a multitude below</l>
       <l n="4">In the sway of an all-including joy</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="6">Blankly I walked there a double decade after ,</l>
       <l n="7">When thwarts had flung their toils in front of me ,</l>
       <l n="8">And I heard the waters wagging in a long ironic laughter</l>
       <l n="9">At the lot of men , and all the vapoury</l>

       <l n="11">Wheeling change has set me again standing where</l>

       <l n="13">But they supplicate now — like a congregation there</l>

       <l n="40">Of witless things :</l>
       <l n="41">Nothing to read , nothing to see</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="44">We were irked by the scene , by our own selves ; yes ,</l>

       <l n="48">By me in her .</l>
       <l n="49">Wasted were two souls in their prime ,</l>

       <l n="54">On afternoons of drowsy calm</l>

       <l n="57">To the tune of “ Cambridge New . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="58">We watched the elms , we watched the rooks ,</l>
       <l n="59">The clouds upon the breeze ,</l>
       <l n="60">Between the whiles of glancing at our books ,</l>
       <l n="61">And swaying like the trees .</l>

       <l n="62">So mindless were those outpourings ! -</l>

       <l n="4">Her father , she , I .</l>

       <l n="12">Hold sway there again .</l>
       <l n="13">Of the churchgoers through the still meadows</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">I met you first — ah , when did I first meet you ?</l>
       <l n="2">When I was full of wonder , and innocent ,</l>
       <l n="3">Standing meek-eyed with those of choric bent ,</l>
       <l n="4">While dimming day grew dimmer</l>
       <l n="5">In the pulpit-glimmer .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="6">Much riper in years I met you — in a temple</l>
       <l n="7">Where summer sunset streamed upon our shapes ,</l>
       <l n="8">And you spread over me like a gauze that drapes ,</l>
       <l n="9">And flapped from floor to rafters ,</l>
       <l n="10">Sweet as angels ’ laughters .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="11">But you had been stripped of some of your old vesture</l>
       <l n="12">By Monk , or another . Now you wore no frill ,</l>
       <l n="13">And at first you startled me . But I knew you still ,</l>
       <l n="14">Though I missed the minim 's waver ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="16">I grew accustomed to you thus . And you hailed me</l>
       <l n="17">Through one who evoked you often . Then at last</l>
       <l n="18">Your raiser was borne off , and I mourned you had passed</l>
       <l n="19">From my life with your late outsetter ;</l>
       <l n="20">Till I said , “ ‘ Tis better ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="21">But you waylaid me . I rose and went as a ghost goes ,</l>
       <l n="22">And said , eyes-full “ I 'll never hear it again !</l>
       <l n="23">It is overmuch for scathed and memoried men</l>
       <l n="24">When sitting among strange people</l>

       <l n="26">Now , a new stirrer of tones calls you up before me</l>

       <l n="33">Here in these turmoiled years of belligerent fire</l>

       <l n="1">She looked like a bird from a cloud</l>
       <l n="2">On the clammy lawn ,</l>

       <l n="4">In the dim of dawn .</l>
       <l n="5">The candles alight in the room</l>

       <l n="22">I was bound to obey ,</l>
       <l n="23">And stepped through the casement to her</l>
       <l n="24">Still alone in the gray .</l>

       <l n="25">“ I am leaving you . . . Farewell ! ” I said ,</l>

       <l n="1">When the Present has latched its postern behind my tremulous stay ,</l>
       <l n="2">And the May month flaps its glad green leaves like wings ,</l>
       <l n="3">Delicate-filmed as new-spun silk , will the neighbours say ,</l>
       <l n="4">“ He was a man who used to notice such things ” ?</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">If it be in the dusk when , like an eyelid 's soundless blink ,</l>
       <l n="6">The dewfall-hawk comes crossing the shades to alight</l>
       <l n="7">Upon the wind-warped upland thorn , a gazer may think ,</l>
       <l n="8">“ To him this must have been a familiar sight . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">If I pass during some nocturnal blackness , mothy and warm ,</l>
       <l n="10">When the hedgehog travels furtively over the lawn ,</l>
       <l n="11">One may say , “ He strove that such innocent creatures should come to</l>
       <l n="12">no harm ,</l>
       <l n="13">But he could do little for them ; and now he is gone ” ?</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="14">If , when hearing that I have been stilled at last , they stand at the</l>
       <l n="15">door ,</l>
       <l n="16">Watching the full-starred heavens that winter sees ,</l>
       <l n="17">Will this thought rise on those who will meet my face no more ,</l>
       <l n="18">“ He was one who had an eye for such mysteries ” ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="19">And will any say when my bell of quittance is heard in the gloom ,</l>
       <l n="20">And a crossing breeze cuts a pause in its outrollings ,</l>
       <l n="21">Till they rise again , as they were a new bell 's boom ,</l>
       <l n="22">“ He hears it not now , but used to notice such things ” ?</l>
