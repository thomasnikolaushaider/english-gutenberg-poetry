    <head>INTRODUCTION .</head>
    <p n="1">“ A ray has pierced me from the highest heaven — I have believed in worth ; and do believe . ”</p>
    <p n="2">So runs Mr. Woolner 's song , as it proceeds to show the issue of a noble earthly love , one with the heavenly . Its issue is the life of high endeavour , wherein</p>
    <p n="3">“ They who would be something more Than they who feast , and laugh and die , will hear The voice of Duty , as the note of war , Nerving their spirits to great enterprise , And knitting every sinew for the charge . ”</p>
    <p n="4">This Library is based on a belief in worth , and on a knowledge of the wide desire among men now to read books that are books , which “ do , ” as Milton says , “ contain a potency of life in them to be as active as that soul whose progeny they are ; nay , they do preserve as in a vial the purest efficacy and extraction of that living intellect that bred them . ” When , therefore , as now happens for the second time , a man of genius who has written with a hope to lift the hearts and minds of men by adding one more true book to the treasures of the land , honours us by such recognition of our aim , and fellow-feeling with it , that he gives up a part of his exclusive right to his own work , and offers to make it freely current with the other volumes of our series ,— we take the gift , if we may dare to say so , in the spirit of the giver , and are the happier for such evidence that we are not working in vain .</p>
    <p n="5">Such evidence comes in other forms : as in letters from remote readers in lonely settlements , from the far West , from sheep-farms in Australia , from farthest India , from places to which these little volumes make their way as pioneers ; being almost the first real books that have there been seen . To send a true voice over , for delight and support of earnest workers who open their hearts wide to a good book in a way that we can hardly understand ,— we who live wastefully in the midst of plenty , and are apt sometimes to leave to feed on the fair mountain and batten on the moor ,— is worth the while of any man of genius who puts his soul into his work , as Mr. Woolner does .</p>
    <p n="6">Books in the “ National Library ” that come like those of Mr. Patmore and Mr. Woolner are here as friends and companions . If they were not esteemed highly they would not be here . Beyond that implied opinion there is nothing to be said . He would be an ill-bred host who criticised his guest , or spoke loud praise of him before his face . Nor does a well - known man of our own day need personal introduction . It is only said , in consideration that this book will be read by many who cannot know what is known to those who have access to the works of artists , that Mr. Thomas Woolner is a Royal Academician , and one of the foremost sculptors of our day . For a couple of years , from 1877 to 1879 , he was Professor of Sculpture at the Royal Academy . A colossal statue by him in bronze of Captain Cook was designed for a site overlooking Sydney Harbour . A poet 's mind has given life to his work on the marble , and when he was an associate with Mr. Millais , Mr. Holman Hunt , and others , who , in 1850 , were endeavouring to bring truth and beauty of expression into art , by the bold reaction against tame and insincere conventions for which Mr. Ruskin pleaded and which the time required , Mr. Woolner joined in the production by them of a magazine called “ The Germ , ” to which some of the verses in this volume were contributed .</p>
    <p n="7">There is no more to say ; but through another page let Wordsworth speak the praise of Books :</p>
    <p n="8">Yet is it just That here , in memory of all books which lay Their sure foundations in the heart of man , Whether by native prose , or numerous verse . That in the name of all inspired souls — From Homer the great thunderer , from the voice That roars along the bed of Jewish song , And that more varied and elaborate , Those trumpet tones of harmony that shake Our shores in England — from those loftiest notes , Down to the low and wren-like warblings , made For cottagers and spinners at the wheel And sunburnt travellers resting their tired limbs Stretched under wayside hedgerows , ballad tunes Food for the hungry ears of little ones And of old men who have survived their joys — ‘ Tis just that in behalf of these , the works , And of the men that framed them , whether known Or sleeping nameless in their scattered graves , That I should here assert their rights , attest Their honours , and should , once for all , pronounce Their benediction ; speak of them as Powers For ever to be hallowed ; only less , For what we are and what we may become , Than Nature 's self , which is the breath of God , Or His pure Word by miracle revealed .</p>

    <head>MY BEAUTIFUL LADY . INTRODUCTION .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In some there lies a sorrow too profound</l>
     <l n="2">To find a voice or to reveal itself</l>
     <l n="3">Throughout the strain of daily toil , or thought ,</l>
     <l n="4">Or during converse born of souls allied ,</l>
     <l n="5">As aught men understand . And though mayhap</l>
     <l n="6">Their cheeks will thin or droop ; and wane their eyes ’</l>
     <l n="7">Frank lustre ; hair may lose its hue , or fall ;</l>
     <l n="8">And health may slacken low in force ; and they</l>
     <l n="9">Are older than the warrant of their years ;</l>
     <l n="10">Yet they to others seem to gild their lives</l>
     <l n="11">With cheerfulness , and every duty tend ,</l>
     <l n="12">As if their aspects told the truth within .</l>
     <l n="13">But they are not as others : not for them</l>
     <l n="14">The bounding pulse , and ardour of desire ,</l>
     <l n="15">The rapture and the wonder in things new ;</l>
     <l n="16">The hope that palpitating enters where</l>
     <l n="17">Perfection smiles on universal life ;</l>
     <l n="18">Nor do they with elastic enterprise</l>
     <l n="19">Forecast delight in compassing results ;</l>
     <l n="20">Nor , having won their ends , fall godlike back</l>
     <l n="21">And taste the calm completion of content .</l>
     <l n="22">But in a sober chilled grey atmosphere</l>
     <l n="23">Work out their lives ; more various though they are</l>
     <l n="24">Than creatures in the unknown ocean depths ,</l>
     <l n="25">Yet each in whom this vital grief has root</l>
     <l n="26">Is dull to what makes everything of worth .</l>
     <l n="27">And though , may be , a shallow bodily joy</l>
     <l n="28">Oft tingles through them at the breathing spring ,</l>
     <l n="29">Or first-heard exultation of the lark ;</l>
     <l n="30">Still that deep weight draws ever steadily</l>
     <l n="31">Their thoughts and passions back to secret woe .</l>
     <l n="32">Though , if endowed with light , heroic deeds</l>
     <l n="33">May be achieved ; and if benignly bent</l>
     <l n="34">They may be treasured blessings through their lives ;</l>
     <l n="35">Yet power and goodness are to them as dreams ,</l>
     <l n="36">And they heed vaguely , if their waking sight</l>
     <l n="37">Be met with slanting storm against the pane ,</l>
     <l n="38">Or sunshine glittering on the leaves that play</l>
     <l n="39">In purest blue of breezy summer morns .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="40">Whence springs this well of mournfulness profound ,</l>
     <l n="41">Unfathomable to plummet cast by man ?</l>
     <l n="42">Alas ; for who can tell ! Whence comes the wind</l>
     <l n="43">Heaving the ocean into maddened arms</l>
     <l n="44">That clutch and dash huge vessels on the rocks ,</l>
     <l n="45">And scatter them , as if compacted slight</l>
     <l n="46">As little eggs boys star against a tree</l>
     <l n="47">In wanton mischief ? Whence , detestable ,</l>
     <l n="48">To man , who suffers from the monster-jaws ,</l>
     <l n="49">The power that in the logging crocodiles ’</l>
     <l n="50">Outrageous bulk puts evil fire of life ?</l>
     <l n="51">That spouts from mountain-pyramids a flood</l>
     <l n="52">Of lava , overwhelming works and men</l>
     <l n="53">In burning , fetid ruin ?— The power that stings</l>
     <l n="54">A city with a pestilence : or turns</l>
     <l n="55">The pretty babe , who in his mother 's lap</l>
     <l n="56">Babbles her back the lavished kiss and laugh ,</l>
     <l n="57">Through lusts and vassalage to obdurate sin ,</l>
     <l n="58">Into a knife-armed midnight murderer ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="59">Our lives are mysteries , and rarely scanned</l>
     <l n="60">As we read stories writ by mortal pen .</l>
     <l n="61">We can perchance but catch a straying weft</l>
     <l n="62">And trace the hinted texture here or there ,</l>
     <l n="63">Of that stupendous loom weaving our fates .</l>
     <l n="64">Two parents , late in life , are haply blessed</l>
     <l n="65">With one bright child , a wonder in his years ,</l>
     <l n="66">For loveliness and genius versatile :</l>
     <l n="67">Some common ill destroys him ; parents , both ,</l>
     <l n="68">Until their death , are left but living tombs</l>
     <l n="69">That hold the one dead image of their joy .</l>
     <l n="70">A man , the flower of honour , who has found</l>
     <l n="71">His well-beloved young daughter fled from home ,</l>
     <l n="72">Fallen from her maidenhood , a nameless thing</l>
     <l n="73">Tainting his blood . A youth who throws the strength</l>
     <l n="74">Of his whole being into love for one</l>
     <l n="75">Answering him honeyed smiles , and leaves his land</l>
     <l n="76">For some far country , seeking wealth he hopes</l>
     <l n="77">Will grace her daintily with choice delights ,</l>
     <l n="78">And on returning sees the honeyed smiles</l>
     <l n="79">Are sweetening other lips . A husband who</l>
     <l n="80">Has found that household curse , a faithless wife .</l>
     <l n="81">A thinker whose far-piercing care perceives</l>
     <l n="82">His nation goes the road that ends in shame .</l>
     <l n="83">A gracious woman whose reserve denies</l>
     <l n="84">The power to utter what consumes her heart .</l>
     <l n="85">Such instances ( and some a loss to know ,</l>
     <l n="86">Which steadfast reticence will shield from those ,</l>
     <l n="87">Debased or garrulous , whose hearts corrupt ,</l>
     <l n="88">But learn the gloomy secrets of their kind</l>
     <l n="89">To poison-tip their wit , or grope and grin</l>
     <l n="90">With pharisaic laughter at disgrace ) —</l>
     <l n="91">Such instances as these demand no guide</l>
     <l n="92">To thrid the dismal issues from their source !</l>
     <l n="93">But others are there , lying fast concealed ,</l>
     <l n="94">Dark , hopeless , and unutterably sad ,</l>
     <l n="95">Which have not been , and never may be known .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="96">Then we may well call happy one whose grief ,</l>
     <l n="97">Mixed up with sacred memories of the past ,</l>
     <l n="98">Can tell to others how the tempest rose ,</l>
     <l n="99">That struck and left him lonely in the world ;</l>
     <l n="100">And who , narrating , feels his sorrow soothed ,</l>
     <l n="101">By that respect which love and sorrow claim .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="102">It much behoves us all , but chiefly those</l>
     <l n="103">Whom fate has favoured with an easy trust ,</l>
     <l n="104">To keep a bridle upon restless speech</l>
     <l n="105">And thought : and not in flagrant haste prejudge</l>
     <l n="106">The first presentment as the rounded truth .</l>
     <l n="107">For true it is , that rapid thoughts , and freak</l>
     <l n="108">Of skimming word , and glance , more frequently</l>
     <l n="109">Than either malice , settled hate , or scorn ,</l>
     <l n="110">Support confusion , and pervert the right ;</l>
     <l n="111">Set up the weakling in the strong man 's place ;</l>
     <l n="112">And yoke the great one 's strength to idleness ;</l>
     <l n="113">Pour gold into the squanderer 's purse , and suck</l>
     <l n="114">The wealth , which is a power , from their control</l>
     <l n="115">Who would have turned it unto noble use .</l>
     <l n="116">And oftentimes a man will strike his friend ,</l>
     <l n="117">By random verbiage , with sharper pain</l>
     <l n="118">Than could a foe , yet scarcely mean him wrong ;</l>
     <l n="119">For none can strip this complex masquerade</l>
     <l n="120">And know who languishes with secret wounds .</l>
     <l n="121">They whom the brunt of war has maimed in limb ,</l>
     <l n="122">Who lean on crutches to sustain their weight ,</l>
     <l n="123">Are manifest to all ; and reverence</l>
     <l n="124">For their misfortunes kindly gains them place :</l>
     <l n="125">But wounds , sometimes more deep and dangerous ,</l>
     <l n="126">We may in careless jostle through the crowd ,</l>
     <l n="127">Gall and oppress , because to us unknown .</l>
     <l n="128">Then , howsoever by our needs impelled ,</l>
     <l n="129">Let us resolve to move in gentleness ;</l>
     <l n="130">Judge mildly when we doubt ; and pause awhile</l>
     <l n="131">Before injustice palpably proclaimed</l>
     <l n="132">Ere we let fall the judgment stroke : against</l>
     <l n="133">Their ignominious craft , who ever wait</l>
     <l n="134">To filch another 's right , we will maintain</l>
     <l n="135">Majestic peace in silence ; knowing well</l>
     <l n="136">Their craft takes something richer from themselves .</l>
     <l n="137">It is but seemly to respect the great ;</l>
     <l n="138">But never let us fail toward lowly ones ;</l>
     <l n="139">Respecting more , in that they lack the force</l>
     <l n="140">To claim it of the world . For souls there are</l>
     <l n="141">Of poor capacities , whose purpose holds ,</l>
     <l n="142">Throughout their unregarded lives , a worth ,</l>
     <l n="143">And earnest law of fixed integrity ,</l>
     <l n="144">That were an honour even unto those</l>
     <l n="145">Whose genius marks the boundaries of our race .</l>

    <p>PART THE FIRST .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>LOVE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Love comes divinely , gladdening mortal life ,</l>
     <l n="2">As sunrise dawns upon the gaze of one</l>
     <l n="3">Bewildered in some outland waste , and lost :</l>
     <l n="4">Who , lonely faint and shuddering , through the night</l>
     <l n="5">Heard savage creatures nigh ; and far-off moan</l>
     <l n="6">Of tempests on the wind .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Auroral joy</l>
     <l n="8">Flushes the brow of childhood , warms his cheek</l>
     <l n="9">To rosier redness at the name of Love ;</l>
     <l n="10">And earlier thoughts awake in darkness strive ;</l>
     <l n="11">As unfledged nestlings move their sightless heads</l>
     <l n="12">At sound , toward a fair world to them unknown .</l>
     <l n="13">Young Hope scales azure mountain heights to gaze ,</l>
     <l n="14">In Love 's first golden and delicious dream .</l>
     <l n="15">He sees the earth a maze of tempting paths ,</l>
     <l n="16">For blissful sauntering mid the crowded flowers</l>
     <l n="17">And music of the rills . No ambushed wrongs ,</l>
     <l n="18">Or thwarting storms there baffle and surprise ;</l>
     <l n="19">But lingering , man treads long an odorous way ;</l>
     <l n="20">And at the close , with Love clasped hand in hand ,</l>
     <l n="21">Sets in proud glory : thence to rise anon</l>
     <l n="22">With Love beyond the stars and rest in heaven .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="23">Man , nerved by Love , can steadily endure</l>
     <l n="24">Clash of opposing interests ; perplexed web</l>
     <l n="25">Of crosses that distracting clog advance :</l>
     <l n="26">In thickest storm of contest waxes stronger</l>
     <l n="27">At momentary thought of home , of her ,</l>
     <l n="28">His gracious wife , and bright-faced joys .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="29">To him</l>
     <l n="30">The wrinkled patriarch , who sits and suns</l>
     <l n="31">His shrunken form beneath the boughs he climbed</l>
     <l n="32">A lissom boy , whence comes that brooding smile ,</l>
     <l n="33">Whose secret lifts his cheeks , and overflows</l>
     <l n="34">His sight with tender dew ? What through his frame</l>
     <l n="35">Melts languor sweeter than approaching sleep</l>
     <l n="36">To one made weary by a hard day 's toil ?</l>
     <l n="37">It is the memory of primal love ,</l>
     <l n="38">Whose visionary splendour steeped his life</l>
     <l n="39">In hues of heaven ; and which grown open day ,</l>
     <l n="40">Revealing perilous falls , his steps confined</l>
     <l n="41">Within the pathways to the noblest end .</l>
     <l n="42">Now following this dimmed glory , tired , his soul</l>
     <l n="43">Haunts ever the mysterious gates of Death ;</l>
     <l n="44">And waits in patient reverence till his doom</l>
     <l n="45">Unfolding them fulfils immortal Love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="46">As from some height , on a wild day of cloud ,</l>
     <l n="47">A wanderer , chilled and worn , perchance beholds</l>
     <l n="48">Move toward him through the landscape soaked in gloom</l>
     <l n="49">A golden beam of light ; creating lakes ,</l>
     <l n="50">And verdant pasture , farms , and villages ;</l>
     <l n="51">And touching spires atop to flickering flame ;</l>
     <l n="52">Disclosing herds of sober feeding kine ;</l>
     <l n="53">And brightening on its way the woods to song ;</l>
     <l n="54">As he , that wanderer , brightens when the shaft</l>
     <l n="55">Suddenly falls on him . A moment warmed ,</l>
     <l n="56">He scarcely feels its loveliness before</l>
     <l n="57">The light departing leaves his saddened soul</l>
     <l n="58">More cold than ere it came .</l>
     <l n="59">Thus love once shone</l>
     <l n="60">And blessed my life : so vanished into gloom .</l>

   <p>The steward to that stately country home Looked native there as lichen to the oak . He first held station , chief in care and trust , That day which gave his baby mistress birth ; And her he loved as father loves his own , Bearing her too that reverence which we feel Toward those who , born to loftier state than ours , Sit their high fortune with becoming grace . His love she ever sumptuously returned In bounteous thankfulness for service done : How brightly twinkled then his shrewd grey eyes , And shone the roundness where his honest cheeks Played to the rippling gladness of his mouth ! In childhood rambles , it was mostly he She chose for partner , spite of blandishment ; And to her winsome ways he would forego His pompous surveillance of wine and plate , To guard her , lilting , where the summer lay On honeyed murmuring limes , and under elms , August with knotted centuries of strength And rooks sonorous in their shadowy heights . By thymy slopes , foot-deep in sward they roved , Both lightly garrulous , and she , sweet child , Fusing her whole attention into joy , Until they stood before the lake , that gleamed With water-lilies , sun , and moving cloud . Then straight the flanking sedge , and reeds remote , Gave clattering ducks and wild outlandish fowl , That tore in stormy scampering and splash To snap with clamour at the crumbled bread , He had provided slyly , bent on fun : The swans meanwhile , majestic , puffed , and slow , Came proudly into action ; but alas , To small result ; for by mischance the spoil Through dexterous skirmish fell to meaner bills . “ Our bread is all cast on the waters now , And well I 'd like to know how many days It must bide there before ‘ tis found again ! ” — Some fool 's dull joke repeated : good man , he , Unversed in deep text comment , never dreamed What time its Abyssinian mountain roots Swollen by fresh torrents mixed in Nubian lands , And thundered down from rocky ledge to ledge ; How sacred Nilus flooding bank and plain Transformed old Egypt to a shining sea : And slaves in swarthy crowds , despised as dirt , Paddled upon the water scattering corn , While swam to their sad eyes a raking glance Of temple sphinxes , palms , and pyramids , Faint sacrificial fire with dismal cries ; And small hard masters , armed with blooded thongs , Jocose and fierce , scourged out their utmost toil . Long ages ere man heard this promised hope , THE FIRST SHALL BE THE LAST , THE LAST THE FIRST . But the dear child his vacant prattle heard In wonder , and believed it lore profound : And ever after , when in solemn church , ( The very church I have before me now ! ) Or household prayer , these words were touched upon , Pert visions would intrude of gabbling fowls Mid splashing water , sedge , and lily stars .</p>

      <l n="679">Making edged danger discipline his strength ,</l>
      <l n="680">That changes hindrance into past delight ,</l>
      <l n="681">Fair Duty dowers with her celestial love ,</l>
      <l n="682">From which the mystic blessing glory grows :</l>

      <l n="689">A well-planned city in a governed land</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Ah , Nelly Dale , nigh fifty years</l>
     <l n="2">Since you and I set out together ,</l>
     <l n="3">Joyful both , as the summer weather ,</l>
     <l n="4">That swarmed our pathway to the meres</l>
     <l n="5">So rich with blossom , and opulent</l>
     <l n="6">Successive honeysuckle scent ,</l>
     <l n="7">It smiled a golden garden , gay</l>
     <l n="8">With flutter of insects all the way !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">The kine were white and smooth as silk</l>
     <l n="10">At Flowerdew 's , where we went for milk</l>
     <l n="11">With jug and can . The can you bore</l>
     <l n="12">Jingled and tumbled when you tore</l>
     <l n="13">Your new frock striped with lilac , while</l>
     <l n="14">Crossing that high-built awkward stile .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">Leaving our cottage gates at noon ,</l>
     <l n="16">Adown the dusty hill we soon</l>
     <l n="17">Turned in a water-alley , dry</l>
     <l n="18">As our discourse ; for we were shy ,</l>
     <l n="19">Speaking not till the double ranks</l>
     <l n="20">Of willows on their shadowed banks</l>
     <l n="21">Had closed us from the road , and we</l>
     <l n="22">Were all we saw and cared to see .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="23">As if let out from school we ran ,</l>
     <l n="24">Until we settled stride for stride</l>
     <l n="25">To even walking , side by side ;</l>
     <l n="26">And tho ’ to keep apart we tried ,</l>
     <l n="27">The jug kept clinking against the can !</l>
     <l n="28">Once pausing in an upper path</l>
     <l n="29">That hemmed great pasture ribbed with math ,</l>
     <l n="30">We saw the prospect openly</l>
     <l n="31">Melt in remote transparent sky ;</l>
     <l n="32">Some fancy kindled , and I began</l>
     <l n="33">To whistle “ Tom the Piper 's Son , ”</l>
     <l n="34">Wondering whether , when grown a man ,</l>
     <l n="35">I should remain to plod , or plan ,</l>
     <l n="36">As others about had always done ,</l>
     <l n="37">Or to some wondrous country stray ,</l>
     <l n="38">Over the hills and far away !</l>
     <l n="39">But turning to your comely face ,</l>
     <l n="40">The opened flower of native grace</l>
     <l n="41">That casts a charm on homely ways ,</l>
     <l n="42">Your mother 's boast , her constant praise ;</l>
     <l n="43">Contented here , I hoped I might</l>
     <l n="44">Be never from my darling 's sight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="45">Ah , me , our young delight to roam</l>
     <l n="46">Along that lane so far from home !</l>
     <l n="47">Laughter , and chatter of this or that ;</l>
     <l n="48">Ripening strawberries , mice and cat ;</l>
     <l n="49">The birthday near ; the birthday treat ,</l>
     <l n="50">With something extra good to eat ,</l>
     <l n="51">And currant , cowslip , elder wine ,</l>
     <l n="52">As real lords and ladies dine !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="53">Equal delight our silence next ;</l>
     <l n="54">Making-believe that you are vext ,</l>
     <l n="55">When swooping round to kiss you I</l>
     <l n="56">Tumble your bonnet all awry ,</l>
     <l n="57">And promptly you the strings untie</l>
     <l n="58">To set it duly straight again ;</l>
     <l n="59">How smartly twinkle ribands twain</l>
     <l n="60">To bows , turned sidewise in disdain ,</l>
     <l n="61">Till by your nimble fingers fixed</l>
     <l n="62">They settle amicably mixed !</l>
     <l n="63">Moments of mutual mute surprise</l>
     <l n="64">Made converse of our glancing eyes ,</l>
     <l n="65">As we went onward , all things seeming</l>
     <l n="66">Strange , and rich , and fair , while dreaming</l>
     <l n="67">Transient glimpses of what alone</l>
     <l n="68">Is ever by great-winged angels known .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="69">We knew not whether you or I</l>
     <l n="70">First saw the splendid butterfly</l>
     <l n="71">Trembling about us as we turned</l>
     <l n="72">To watch how blue and crimson burned</l>
     <l n="73">In flashes ‘ twixt those blushing wings !</l>
     <l n="74">Nelly , I see you watch the lark</l>
     <l n="75">That fluttering high , aspiring sings ;</l>
     <l n="76">We both watch till our sight grows dark ,</l>
     <l n="77">And wonder whither he is fled</l>
     <l n="78">In sapphire ether overhead .</l>
     <l n="79">Tho ’ vanished , still his rapture rings</l>
     <l n="80">And thrills our bosoms , marching slow</l>
     <l n="81">Our winding way ; when brilliant , lo</l>
     <l n="82">From somewhere starting , re-appears</l>
     <l n="83">Our friendly butterfly , and nears</l>
     <l n="84">A spider-web , in holly spun</l>
     <l n="85">With rainbow hues that net the sun ,</l>
     <l n="86">Making coy circles ere he alight</l>
     <l n="87">Entangled in the toil of death !</l>
     <l n="88">Forward I spring , without my breath ,</l>
     <l n="89">To see the fiend , high-elbowed , whirl</l>
     <l n="90">Around those limbs and wings , and twirl</l>
     <l n="91">His thread to thwart the chance of flight .</l>
     <l n="92">Fate on a single instant hangs ,</l>
     <l n="93">And ready the demon 's eager fangs</l>
     <l n="94">To penetrate that sylphic breast !</l>
     <l n="95">Nipping the wing-tips gently I</l>
     <l n="96">Flirt him from danger suddenly ;</l>
     <l n="97">Strike with my cap a rapid blow ,</l>
     <l n="98">Dashing the enemy down below</l>
     <l n="99">Thro ’ grass crushed safely into dust .</l>
     <l n="100">There shivering on my stretched forefinger</l>
     <l n="101">A little while his terrors linger ,</l>
     <l n="102">Doubting if yet his wings to trust ,</l>
     <l n="103">Ere , with a bolder flap or two ,</l>
     <l n="104">He flutters into airy blue .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="105">Could any mortal boy resist ,</l>
     <l n="106">When heavenward , in a rosy pout</l>
     <l n="107">Your lips you offered to be kissed ;</l>
     <l n="108">Fresh as carnations breaking out</l>
     <l n="109">Of dewy sheaths , on summer dawns</l>
     <l n="110">Yet pale upon the misty lawns !</l>
     <l n="111">We pass from shadowy splendour soon</l>
     <l n="112">To face the blazoned afternoon ,</l>
     <l n="113">Where wide around the basking sun</l>
     <l n="114">Lies on the meadow fast asleep .</l>
     <l n="115">Near random bushes , one by one ,</l>
     <l n="116">Nestled around a pond , the sheep</l>
     <l n="117">Are scattered and doze in graceful shade ;</l>
     <l n="118">And hazed cornfields beyond the glade ,</l>
     <l n="119">Undulating and dazzling sight ,</l>
     <l n="120">Seem quivering for predestined flight</l>
     <l n="121">To worlds of unrevealed delight .</l>
     <l n="122">In lustrous sheen , their stately looks</l>
     <l n="123">Sedate as parsons reading books ,</l>
     <l n="124">Flock grey-billed , see-saw-gaited rooks</l>
     <l n="125">Strutting ; or when they wings assume</l>
     <l n="126">Pluck the warm air with fingered plume ,</l>
     <l n="127">Labouring , anxious if weight and size</l>
     <l n="128">Make flight most hazardous or wise !</l>
     <l n="129">Nelly we sauntered on and on</l>
     <l n="130">By hedgerows , brightly overhung</l>
     <l n="131">And sprinkled thick with snowy showers</l>
     <l n="132">Of woodbine stars ; where bindweed flowers</l>
     <l n="133">Ample and moon-white nobly shone ,</l>
     <l n="134">And over green abysses slung ,</l>
     <l n="135">Mid honey-haunted sound of bees ,</l>
     <l n="136">Swayed lightly to the scented breeze .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="137">In passing starwort 's silvery gems ,</l>
     <l n="138">By maple 's warm fawn-tinted stems ,</l>
     <l n="139">Caprices that gnarled the oak and thorn ,</l>
     <l n="140">A sudden scream of rageful scorn</l>
     <l n="141">Startles us from the hedgerow nigh ;</l>
     <l n="142">Whence two disturbed fierce blackbirds fly</l>
     <l n="143">Uttering threats of vengeance dire !</l>
     <l n="144">While we , who lit this angry fire ,</l>
     <l n="145">Are wondering such discordant throats</l>
     <l n="146">Can tune those soft melodious notes</l>
     <l n="147">The fondest lover 's listening ear ,</l>
     <l n="148">At even , turns entranced to hear !</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="149">But if I sang of every sight</l>
     <l n="150">That afternoon which gave delight ,</l>
     <l n="151">Those treasures would my numbers throng</l>
     <l n="152">Beyond the compass of my song ;</l>
     <l n="153">Therefore , Nelly , to be precise ,</l>
     <l n="154">We bought the milk , and paid the price</l>
     <l n="155">Charged in that rural paradise .</l>
     <l n="156">The rolls of butter , the jars of cream ,</l>
     <l n="157">Churn , and cleanly pans , now seem ,</l>
     <l n="158">Thro ’ fifty years of vanished time ,</l>
     <l n="159">The memories of a nursery rhyme ;</l>
     <l n="160">Or story , like The “ Babes in the Wood , ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="162">Homeward we went in soberer mood ;</l>
     <l n="163">Haply the weight we had to carry ,</l>
     <l n="164">By stile and gate oft made us tarry</l>
     <l n="165">To change our hands , and ease the weight</l>
     <l n="166">By making both co-operate .</l>
     <l n="167">At length we knew the hour grew late ,</l>
     <l n="168">Because we saw our shadows rise ,</l>
     <l n="169">Mocking our motions , thrice our size ;</l>
     <l n="170">And keeping faithful phantom pace ,</l>
     <l n="171">Tempting us to an elfin race</l>
     <l n="172">For fairy treasure ; all in play !</l>
     <l n="173">For which , whatever they might say ,</l>
     <l n="174">We knew our lives would have to pay !</l>
     <l n="175">Both breaking into prattle showed</l>
     <l n="176">How pleased we trod the dusty road</l>
     <l n="177">Once more ; and rested where the rill</l>
     <l n="178">Sings issuing , halfway up the hill ;</l>
     <l n="179">Where maids and wives their pitchers bring</l>
     <l n="180">To fill , and gossip at the spring .</l>
     <l n="181">To gossip ourselves we durst not stop ,</l>
     <l n="182">As we had yet to reach the top</l>
     <l n="183">Where , starting from before the moon ,</l>
     <l n="184">Our church spire quickened , rose , and danced</l>
     <l n="185">Higher and higher as we advanced ,</l>
     <l n="186">And on a sudden ceased , as soon</l>
     <l n="187">As we were on the level ; then ,</l>
     <l n="188">There your mother stood at the gate</l>
     <l n="189">Impatient we were out so late ;</l>
     <l n="190">Inquiring how , and why , and when ;</l>
     <l n="191">She thought we had been drowned , and lost ,</l>
     <l n="192">And by some savage mad bull tossed ;</l>
     <l n="193">So long had she been looking out !</l>
     <l n="194">Whatever had we been about ?</l>
     <l n="195">Altho ’ we saw so much that day ,</l>
     <l n="196">But little then had we to say ,</l>
     <l n="197">And told her a bewildered tale</l>
     <l n="198">Of garment torn by splintered rail ;</l>
     <l n="199">Of spiders , blackbirds , butterflies ;</l>
     <l n="200">Of rooks so near that looked so wise !</l>
     <l n="201">Of ghostly shadows , some of the way ,</l>

     <l n="205">The gentle scolding given and past ,</l>

     <l n="209">And brighter through a deepening sky</l>
     <l n="210">A million stars shone o'er my head ,</l>

     <l n="293">Thro ’ ways by wisdom proven best ,</l>
     <l n="294">And sympathetic , generous trust</l>
     <l n="295">To kindly conduct more than just .</l>
     <l n="296">If old experience yet holds true ,</l>
     <l n="297">And by a generation 's lapse</l>
     <l n="298">Your daughter 's child resembles you ,</l>
     <l n="299">Then by that happy law perhaps</l>
     <l n="300">Another Nelly may be seen</l>
     <l n="301">To grace some other village green ;</l>
     <l n="302">As native there as morning dew ;</l>
     <l n="303">Or larks aloft , when lost to view</l>
     <l n="304">They lift us thro ’ the trembling blue</l>
     <l n="305">To soar with them in ecstasy ;</l>
     <l n="306">Or primroses , whose welcome faces</l>
     <l n="307">From sunny banks and shady places ,</l>
     <l n="308">Tenderly glimmer in pallid gold</l>
     <l n="309">Caught as early morning broke ,</l>
     <l n="310">When , dreaming daylight they awoke</l>
     <l n="311">Enamoured from the moistened mold .</l>
     <l n="312">And if a Nelly , tho ’ changed in name ,</l>
     <l n="313">Her fair endowments will the same</l>
     <l n="314">Point every grace that charmed before</l>
     <l n="315">Thro ’ unrenowned ancestresses ,</l>
     <l n="316">Then still there beams a joy that blesses</l>
     <l n="317">The traveller by your cottage door ;</l>
     <l n="318">Who , pleased in after years to trace</l>
     <l n="319">Remembrance of your playful face ,</l>
     <l n="320">May linger on your presence while</l>
     <l n="321">Before him still you turn to smile .</l>
