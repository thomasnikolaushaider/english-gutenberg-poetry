    <docTitle><titlePart>HERE BEGIN POEMS BY THE WAY . WRITTEN BY WILLIAM MORRIS . AND FIRST IS THE POEM CALLED FROM THE UPLAND TO THE SEA . Shall we wake one morn of spring , Glad at heart of everything , Yet pensive with the thought of eve ? Then the white house shall we leave , Pass the wind-flowers and the bays , Through the garth , and go our ways , Wandering down among the meads Till our very joyance needs Rest at last ; till we shall come To that Sun-god 's lonely home , Lonely on the hill-side grey , Whence the sheep have gone away ; Lonely till the feast-time is , When with prayer and praise of bliss , Thither comes the country side . There awhile shall we abide , Sitting low down in the porch By that image with the torch : Thy one white hand laid upon The black pillar that was won From the far-off Indian mine ; And my hand nigh touching thine , But not touching ; and thy gown Fair with spring-flowers cast adown From thy bosom and thy brow . There the south-west wind shall blow Through thine hair to reach my cheek , As thou sittest , nor mayst speak , Nor mayst move the hand I kiss For the very depth of bliss ; Nay , nor turn thine eyes to me . Then desire of the great sea Nigh enow , but all unheard , In the hearts of us is stirred , And we rise , we twain at last , And the daffodils downcast , Feel thy feet and we are gone From the lonely Sun-Crowned one . Then the meads fade at our back , And the spring day ‘ gins to lack That fresh hope that once it had ; But we twain grow yet more glad , And apart no more may go When the grassy slope and low Dieth in the shingly sand : Then we wander hand in hand By the edges of the sea , And I weary more for thee Than if far apart we were , With a space of desert drear ‘ Twixt thy lips and mine , O love ! Ah , my joy , my joy thereof !</titlePart></docTitle>

     <p>OF THE WOOING OF HALLBIORN THE STRONG . A STORY FROM THE LAND - SETTLING BOOK OF ICELAND , CHAPTER XXX .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">At Deildar-Tongue in the autumn-tide ,</l>
       <l n="2">So many times over comes summer again ,</l>
       <l n="3">Stood Odd of Tongue his door beside .</l>
       <l n="4">What healing in summer if winter be vain ?</l>
       <l n="5">Dim and dusk the day was grown ,</l>
       <l n="6">As he heard his folded wethers moan .</l>
       <l n="7">Then through the garth a man drew near ,</l>
       <l n="8">With painted shield and gold-wrought spear .</l>
       <l n="9">Good was his horse and grand his gear ,</l>
       <l n="10">And his girths were wet with Whitewater .</l>
       <l n="11">“ Hail , Master Odd , live blithe and long !</l>
       <l n="12">How fare the folk at Deildar-Tongue ? ”</l>
       <l n="13">“ All hail , thou Hallbiorn the Strong !</l>
       <l n="14">How fare the folk by the Brothers ’ - Tongue ? ”</l>
       <l n="15">“ Meat have we there , and drink and fire ,</l>
       <l n="16">Nor lack all things that we desire .</l>
       <l n="17">But by the other Whitewater</l>
       <l n="18">Of Hallgerd many a tale we hear . ”</l>
       <l n="19">“ Tales enow may my daughter make</l>
       <l n="20">If too many words be said for her sake . ”</l>
       <l n="21">“ What saith thine heart to a word of mine ,</l>
       <l n="22">That I deem thy daughter fair and fine ?</l>
       <l n="23">Fair and fine for a bride is she ,</l>
       <l n="24">And I fain would have her home with me . ”</l>
       <l n="25">“ Full many a word that at noon goes forth</l>
       <l n="26">Comes home at even little worth .</l>
       <l n="27">Now winter treadeth on autumn-tide ,</l>
       <l n="28">So here till the spring shalt thou abide .</l>
       <l n="29">Then if thy mind be changed no whit ,</l>
       <l n="30">And ye still will wed , see ye to it !</l>
       <l n="31">And on the first of summer days ,</l>
       <l n="32">A wedded man , ye may go your ways .</l>
       <l n="33">Yet look , howso the thing will fall ,</l>
       <l n="34">My hand shall meddle nought at all .</l>
       <l n="35">Lo , now the night and rain draweth up ,</l>
       <l n="36">And within doors glimmer stoop and cup .</l>
       <l n="37">And hark , a little sound I know ,</l>
       <l n="38">The laugh of Snaebiorn 's fiddle-bow ,</l>
       <l n="39">My sister 's son , and a craftsman good ,</l>
       <l n="40">When the red rain drives through the iron wood . ”</l>
       <l n="41">Hallbiorn laughed , and followed in ,</l>
       <l n="42">And a merry feast there did begin .</l>
       <l n="43">Hallgerd 's hands undid his weed ,</l>
       <l n="44">Hallgerd 's hands poured out the mead .</l>
       <l n="45">Her fingers at his breast he felt ,</l>
       <l n="46">As her hair fell down about his belt .</l>
       <l n="47">Her fingers with the cup he took ,</l>
       <l n="48">And o'er its rim at her did look .</l>
       <l n="49">Cold cup , warm hand , and fingers slim ,</l>
       <l n="50">Before his eyes were waxen dim .</l>
       <l n="51">And if the feast were foul or fair ,</l>
       <l n="52">He knew not , save that she was there .</l>
       <l n="53">He knew not if men laughed or wept ,</l>
       <l n="54">While still ‘ twixt wall and dais she stept .</l>
       <l n="55">Whether she went or stood that eve ,</l>
       <l n="56">Not once his eyes her face did leave .</l>
       <l n="57">But Snaebiorn laughed and Snaebiorn sang ,</l>
       <l n="58">And sweet his smitten fiddle rang .</l>
       <l n="59">And Hallgerd stood beside him there ,</l>
       <l n="60">So many times over comes summer again ,</l>
       <l n="61">Nor ever once he turned to her ,</l>
       <l n="62">What healing in summer if winter be vain ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="63">Master Odd on the morrow spake ,</l>
       <l n="64">So many times over comes summer again .</l>
       <l n="65">“ Hearken , O guest , if ye be awake , ”</l>
       <l n="66">What healing in summer if winter be vain ?</l>
       <l n="67">“ Sure ye champions of the south</l>
       <l n="68">Speak many things from a silent mouth .</l>
       <l n="69">And thine , meseems , last night did pray</l>
       <l n="70">That ye might well be wed to-day .</l>
       <l n="71">The year 's ingathering feast it is ,</l>
       <l n="72">A goodly day to give thee bliss .</l>
       <l n="73">Come hither , daughter , fine and fair ,</l>
       <l n="74">Here is a Wooer from Whitewater .</l>
       <l n="75">East away hath he gotten fame ,</l>
       <l n="76">And his father 's name is e'en my names .</l>
       <l n="77">Will ye lay hand within his hand ,</l>
       <l n="78">That blossoming fair our house may stand ? ”</l>
       <l n="79">She laid her hand within his hand ;</l>
       <l n="80">White she was as the lily wand .</l>
       <l n="81">Low sang Snaebiorn 's brand in its sheath ,</l>
       <l n="82">And his lips were waxen grey as death .</l>
       <l n="83">“ Snaebiorn , sing us a song of worth ,</l>
       <l n="84">If your song must be silent from now henceforth . ”</l>
       <l n="85">Clear and loud his voice outrang ,</l>
       <l n="86">And a song of worth at the wedding he sang .</l>
       <l n="87">“ Sharp sword , ” he sang , “ and death is sure . ”</l>
       <l n="88">So many times over comes summer again ,</l>
       <l n="89">“ But love doth over all endure . ”</l>
       <l n="90">What healing in summer if winter be vain ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="91">Now winter cometh and weareth away ,</l>
       <l n="92">So many times over comes summer again ,</l>
       <l n="93">And glad is Hallbiorn many a day .</l>
       <l n="94">What healing in summer if winter be vain ?</l>
       <l n="95">Full soft he lay his love beside ;</l>
       <l n="96">But dark are the days of wintertide .</l>
       <l n="97">Dark are the days , and the nights are long ,</l>
       <l n="98">And sweet and fair was Snaebiorn 's song .</l>
       <l n="99">Many a time he talked with her ,</l>
       <l n="100">Till they deemed the summer-tide was there .</l>
       <l n="101">And they forgat the wind-swept ways</l>
       <l n="102">And angry fords of the flitting-days .</l>
       <l n="103">While the north wind swept the hillside there</l>
       <l n="104">They forgat the other Whitewater .</l>
       <l n="105">While nights at Deildar-Tongue were long ,</l>
       <l n="106">They clean forgat the Brothers ’ - Tongue .</l>
       <l n="107">But whatso falleth ‘ twixt Hell and Home ,</l>
       <l n="108">So many times over comes summer again ,</l>
       <l n="109">Full surely again shall summer come .</l>
       <l n="110">What healing in summer if winter be vain ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="111">To Odd spake Hallbiorn on a day</l>
       <l n="112">So many times over comes summer again ,</l>
       <l n="113">“ Gone is the snow from everyway . ”</l>
       <l n="114">What healing in summer if winter be vain ?</l>
       <l n="115">Now green is grown Whitewater-side ,</l>
       <l n="116">And I to Whitewater will ride . ”</l>
       <l n="117">Quoth Odd , “ Well fare thou winter-guest ,</l>
       <l n="118">May thine own Whitewater be best .</l>
       <l n="119">Well is a man 's purse better at home</l>
       <l n="120">Than open where folk go and come . ”</l>
       <l n="121">“ Come ye carles of the south country ,</l>
       <l n="122">Now shall we go our kin to see !</l>
       <l n="123">For the lambs are bleating in the south ,</l>
       <l n="124">And the salmon swims towards Olfus mouth .</l>
       <l n="125">Girth and graithe and gather your gear !</l>
       <l n="126">And ho for the other Whitewater ! ”</l>
       <l n="127">Bright was the moon as bright might be ,</l>
       <l n="128">And Snaebiorn rode to the north country .</l>
       <l n="129">And Odd to Reykholt is gone forth ,</l>
       <l n="130">To see if his mares be ought of worth .</l>
       <l n="131">But Hallbiorn into the bower is gone</l>
       <l n="132">And there sat Hallgerd all alone .</l>
       <l n="133">She was not dight to go nor ride</l>
       <l n="134">She had no joy of the summer-tide .</l>
       <l n="135">Silent she sat and combed her hair ,</l>
       <l n="136">That fell all round about her there .</l>
       <l n="137">The slant beam lay upon her head ,</l>
       <l n="138">And gilt her golden locks to red .</l>
       <l n="139">He gazed at her with hungry eyes</l>
       <l n="140">And fluttering did his heart arise .</l>
       <l n="141">“ Full hot , ” he said , “ is the sun to-day ,</l>
       <l n="142">And the snow is gone from the mountain-way .</l>
       <l n="143">The king-cup grows above the grass ,</l>
       <l n="144">And through the wood do the thrushes pass . ”</l>
       <l n="145">Of all his words she hearkened none ,</l>
       <l n="146">But combed her hair amidst the sun .</l>
       <l n="147">“ The laden beasts stand in the garth</l>
       <l n="148">And their heads are turned to Helliskarth . ”</l>
       <l n="149">The sun was falling on her knee ,</l>
       <l n="150">And she combed her gold hair silently .</l>
       <l n="151">“ To-morrow great will be the cheer</l>
       <l n="152">At the Brothers ’ - Tongue by Whitewater . ”</l>
       <l n="153">From her folded lap the sunbeam slid ;</l>
       <l n="154">She combed her hair , and the word she hid .</l>
       <l n="155">“ Come , love ; is the way so long and drear</l>
       <l n="156">From Whitewater to Whitewater ? ”</l>
       <l n="157">The sunbeam lay upon the floor ;</l>
       <l n="158">She combed her hair and spake no more .</l>
       <l n="159">He drew her by the lily hand :</l>
       <l n="160">“ I love thee better than all the land . ”</l>
       <l n="161">He drew her by the shoulders sweet :</l>
       <l n="162">“ My threshold is but for thy feet . ”</l>
       <l n="163">He drew her by the yellow hair :</l>
       <l n="164">“ O why wert thou so deadly fair ?</l>
       <l n="165">“ O am I wedded to death ? ” he cried</l>
       <l n="166">“ Is the Dead-strand come to Whitewater side ? ”</l>
       <l n="167">And the sun was fading from the room ,</l>
       <l n="168">But her eyes were bright in the change and the gloom .</l>
       <l n="169">“ Sharp sword , ” she sang , “ and death is sure ,</l>
       <l n="170">But over all doth love endure . ”</l>
       <l n="171">She stood up shining in her place</l>
       <l n="172">And laughed beneath his deadly face .</l>
       <l n="173">Instead of the sunbeam gleamed a brand ,</l>
       <l n="174">The hilts were hard in Hallbiorn 's hand :</l>
       <l n="175">The bitter point was in Hallgerd 's breast</l>
       <l n="176">That Snaebiorn 's lips of love had pressed .</l>
       <l n="177">Morn and noon , and nones passed o'er ,</l>
       <l n="178">And the sun is far from the bower door .</l>
       <l n="179">To-morrow morn shall the sun come back ,</l>
       <l n="180">So many times over comes summer again ,</l>
       <l n="181">But Hallgerd 's feet the floor shall lack .</l>
       <l n="182">What healing in summer if winter be vain ?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="183">Now Hallbiorn 's house-carles ride full fast ,</l>
       <l n="184">So many times over comes summer again ,</l>
       <l n="185">Till many a mile of way is past .</l>
       <l n="186">What healing in summer if winter be vain ?</l>
       <l n="187">But when they came over Oxridges ,</l>
       <l n="188">‘ Twas , “ Where shall we give our horses ease ? ”</l>
       <l n="189">When Shieldbroad-side was well in sight ,</l>
       <l n="190">‘ Twas , “ Where shall we lay our heads to-night ? ”</l>

     <head>ICELAND FIRST SEEN</head>
     <p>Lo from our loitering ship a new land at last to be seen ; Toothed rocks down the side of the firth on the east guard a weary wide lea , And black slope the hill-sides above , striped adown with their desolate green : And a peak rises up on the west from the meeting of cloud and of sea , Foursquare from base unto point like the building of Gods that have been , The last of that waste of the mountains all cloud-wreathed and snow-flecked and grey , And bright with the dawn that began just now at the ending of day .</p>
     <p>Ah ! what came we forth for to see that our hearts are so hot with desire ? Is it enough for our rest , the sight of this desolate strand , And the mountain-waste voiceless as death but for winds that may sleep not nor tire ? Why do we long to wend forth through the length and breadth of a land , Dreadful with grinding of ice , and record of scarce hidden fire , But that there ‘ mid the grey grassy dales sore scarred by the ruining streams Lives the tale of the Northland of old and the undying glory of dreams ?</p>
     <p>O land , as some cave by the sea where the treasures of old have been laid , The sword it may be of a king whose name was the turning of fight : Or the staff of some wise of the world that many things made and unmade . Or the ring of a woman maybe whose woe is grown wealth and delight . No wheat and no wine grows above it , no orchard for blossom and shade ; The few ships that sail by its blackness but deem it the mouth of a grave ; Yet sure when the world shall awaken , this too shall be mighty to save .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Or rather , O land , if a marvel</l>
       <l n="2">it seemeth that men ever sought</l>
       <l n="3">Thy wastes for a field and a garden</l>
       <l n="4">fulfilled of all wonder and doubt ,</l>
       <l n="5">And feasted amidst of the winter</l>
       <l n="6">when the light of the year had been fought ,</l>
       <l n="7">Whose plunder all gathered together</l>
       <l n="8">was little to babble about ;</l>
       <l n="9">Cry aloud from thy wastes , O thou land ,</l>
       <l n="10">“ Not for this nor for that was I wrought .</l>
       <l n="11">Amid waning of realms and of riches</l>
       <l n="12">and death of things worshipped and sure ,</l>
       <l n="13">I abide here the spouse of a God ,</l>
       <l n="14">and I made and I make and endure . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>O Queen of the grief without knowledge , of the courage that may not avail , Of the longing that may not attain , of the love that shall never forget , More joy than the gladness of laughter thy voice hath amidst of its wail : More hope than of pleasure fulfilled amidst of thy blindness is set ; More glorious than gaining of all thine unfaltering hand that shall fail : For what is the mark on thy brow but the brand that thy Brynhild doth bear ? Lone once , and loved and undone by a love that no ages outwear .</p>
     <p>Ah ! when thy Balder comes back , and bears from the heart of the Sun Peace and the healing of pain , and the wisdom that waiteth no more ; And the lilies are laid on thy brow ‘ mid the crown of the deeds thou hast done ; And the roses spring up by thy feet that the rocks of the wilderness wore . Ah ! when thy Balder comes back and we gather the gains he hath won , Shall we not linger a little to talk of thy sweetness of old , Yea , turn back awhile to thy travail whence the Gods stood aloof to behold ?</p>

For fair and fierce is thy father , and soft and strange are his eyes That look on the days that shall be with the hope of the brave and the wise . It was many a day that we laughed , as over the meadows we walked , And many a day I hearkened and the pictures came as he talked ; It was many a day that we longed , and we lingered late at eve Ere speech from speech was sundered , and my hand his hand could leave . Then I wept when I was alone , and I longed till the daylight came ; And down the stairs I stole , and there was our housekeeping dame ( No mother of me , the foundling ) kindling the fire betimes Ere the haymaking folk went forth to the meadows down by the limes ; All things I saw at a glance ; the quickening fire-tongues leapt Through the crackling heap of sticks , and the sweet smoke up from it crept , And close to the very hearth the low sun flooded the floor , And the cat and her kittens played in the sun by the open door . The garden was fair in the morning , and there in the road he stood Beyond the crimson daisies and the bush of southernwood . Then side by side together through the grey-walled place we went , And O the fear departed , and the rest and sweet content !</p>

     <p>GUNNAR 'S HOWE ABOVE THE HOUSE AT LITHEND .</p>
     <p>Ye who have come o'er the sea to behold this grey minster of lands , Whose floor is the tomb of time past , and whose walls by the toil of dead hands Show pictures amidst of the ruin of deeds that have overpast death , Stay by this tomb in a tomb to ask of who lieth beneath . Ah ! the world changeth too soon , that ye stand there with unbated breath , As I name him that Gunnar of old , who erst in the haymaking tide Felt all the land fragrant and fresh , as amidst of the edges he died . Too swiftly fame fadeth away , if ye tremble not lest once again The grey mound should open and show him glad-eyed without grudging or pain . Little labour methinks to behold him but the tale-teller laboured in vain .</p>
     <p>Little labour for ears that may hearken to hear his death-conquering song , Till the heart swells to think of the gladness undying that overcame wrong . O young is the world yet meseemeth and the hope of it flourishing green , When the words of a man unremembered so bridge all the days that have been , As we look round about on the land that these nine hundred years he hath seen .</p>
     <p>Dusk is abroad on the grass of this valley amidst of the hill : Dusk that shall never be dark till the dawn hard on midnight shall fill The trench under Eyiafell 's snow , and the grey plain the sea meeteth grey . White , high aloft hangs the moon that no dark night shall brighten ere day , For here day and night toileth the summer lest deedless his time pass away .</p>
     <p>THE DAY IS COMING .</p>
     <p>Come hither lads and hearken , for a tale there is to tell , Of the wonderful days a-coming , when all shall be better than well .</p>
     <p>And the tale shall be told of a country , a land in the midst of the sea , And folk shall call it England in the days that are going to be .</p>
     <p>There more than one in a thousand in the days that are yet to come , Shall have some hope of the morrow , some joy of the ancient home .</p>
     <p>For then , laugh not , but listen , to this strange tale of mine , All folk that are in England shall be better lodged than swine .</p>
     <p>Then a man shall work and bethink him , and rejoice in the deeds of his hand , Nor yet come home in the even too faint and weary to stand .</p>
     <p>Men in that time a-coming shall work and have no fear For to-morrow 's lack of earning and the hunger-wolf anear .</p>
     <p>I tell you this for a wonder , that no man then shall be glad Of his fellow 's fall and mishap to snatch at the work he had .</p>
     <p>For that which the worker winneth shall then be his indeed , Nor shall half be reaped for nothing by him that sowed no seed .</p>
     <p>O strange new wonderful justice ! But for whom shall we gather the gain ? For ourselves and for each of our fellows , and no hand shall labour in vain .</p>
     <p>Then all Mine and all Thine shall be Ours , and no more shall any man crave For riches that serve for nothing but to fetter a friend for a slave .</p>
     <p>And what wealth then shall be left us when none shall gather gold To buy his friend in the market , and pinch and pine the sold ?</p>
     <p>Nay , what save the lovely city , and the little house on the hill , And the wastes and the woodland beauty , and the happy fields we till ;</p>
     <p>And the homes of ancient stories , the tombs of the mighty dead ; And the wise men seeking out marvels , and the poet 's teeming head ;</p>
     <p>And the painter 's hand of wonder ; and the marvellous fiddle-bow , And the banded choirs of music : all those that do and know .</p>
     <p>For all these shall be ours and all men 's nor shall any lack a share Of the toil and the gain of living in the days when the world grows fair .</p>
     <p>Ah ! such are the days that shall be ! But what are the deeds of to-day ,</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">In the days of the years we dwell in ,</l>
       <l n="2">that wear our lives away ?</l>
       <l n="3">Why , then , and for what are we waiting ?</l>
       <l n="4">There are three words to speak ;</l>
       <l n="5">WE WILL IT , and what is the foeman</l>
       <l n="6">but the dream-strong wakened and weak ?</l>
     </lg>
     <p>O why and for what are we waiting ? while our brothers droop and die , And on every wind of the heavens a wasted life goes by .</p>
     <p>How long shall they reproach us where crowd on crowd they dwell , Poor ghosts of the wicked city , the gold-crushed hungry hell ?</p>
     <p>Through squalid life they laboured , in sordid grief they died , Those sons of a mighty mother , those props of England 's pride .</p>
     <p>They are gone ; there is none can undo it , nor save our souls from the curse ; But many a million cometh , and shall they be better or worse ?</p>
     <p>It is we must answer and hasten , and open wide the door For the rich man 's hurrying terror , and the slow-foot hope of the poor .</p>
     <p>Yea , the voiceless wrath of the wretched , and their unlearned discontent , We must give it voice and wisdom till the waiting-tide be spent .</p>
     <p>Come , then , since all things call us , the living and the dead , And o'er the weltering tangle a glimmering light is shed .</p>
     <p>Come , then , let us cast off fooling , and put by ease and rest , For the Cause alone is worthy till the good days bring the best .</p>
     <p>Come , join in the only battle wherein no man can fail , Where whoso fadeth and dieth , yet his deed shall still prevail .</p>
     <p>Ah ! come , cast off all fooling , for this , at least , we know : That the Dawn and the Day is coming , and forth the Banners go .</p>

     <p>In the grave where tyrants thrust them , lies their labour and their pain , But undying from their sorrow springeth up the hope again .</p>
     <p>Mourn not therefore , nor lament it , that the world outlives their life ; Voice and vision yet they give us , making strong our hands for strife .</p>
     <p>Some had name , and fame , and honour , learn 'd they were , and wise and strong ; Some were nameless , poor , unlettered , weak in all but grief and wrong .</p>
     <p>Named and nameless all live in us ; one and all they lead us yet Every pain to count for nothing , every sorrow to forget .</p>
     <p>Hearken how they cry , “ O happy , happy ye that ye were born In the sad slow night 's departing , in the rising of the morn .</p>
     <p>“ Fair the crown the Cause hath for you , well to die or well to live Through the battle , through the tangle , peace to gain or peace to give . ”</p>
     <p>Ah , it may be ! Oft meseemeth , in the days that yet shall be , When no slave of gold abideth ‘ twixt the breadth of sea to sea ,</p>
     <p>Oft , when men and maids are merry , ere the sunlight leaves the earth , And they bless the day beloved , all too short for all their mirth ,</p>
     <p>Some shall pause awhile and ponder on the bitter days of old , Ere the toil of strife and battle overthrew the curse of gold ;</p>
     <p>Then ‘ twixt lips of loved and lover solemn thoughts of us shall rise ; We who once were fools defeated , then shall be the brave and wise .</p>
     <p>There amidst the world new-builded shall our earthly deeds abide , Though our names be all forgotten , and the tale of how we died .</p>
     <p>Life or death then , who shall heed it , what we gain or what we lose ? Fair flies life amid the struggle , and the Cause for each shall choose .</p>
     <p>Hear a word , a word in season , for the day is drawing nigh , When the Cause shall call upon us , some to live , and some to die !</p>

      <head>THE HALF OF LIFE GONE .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The days have slain the days ,</l>
       <l n="2">and the seasons have gone by</l>
       <l n="3">And brought me the summer again ;</l>
       <l n="4">and here on the grass I lie</l>
       <l n="5">As erst I lay and was glad</l>
       <l n="6">ere I meddled with right and with wrong .</l>
       <l n="7">Wide lies the mead as of old ,</l>
       <l n="8">and the river is creeping along</l>
       <l n="9">By the side of the elm-clad bank</l>
       <l n="10">that turns its weedy stream ;</l>
       <l n="11">And grey o'er its hither lip</l>
       <l n="12">the quivering rushes gleam .</l>
       <l n="13">There is work in the mead as of old ;</l>
       <l n="14">they are eager at winning the hay ,</l>
       <l n="15">While every sun sets bright</l>
       <l n="16">and begets a fairer day .</l>
       <l n="17">The forks shine white in the sun</l>
       <l n="18">round the yellow red-wheeled wain ,</l>
       <l n="19">Where the mountain of hay grows fast ;</l>
       <l n="20">and now from out of the lane</l>
       <l n="21">Comes the ox-team drawing another ,</l>
       <l n="22">comes the bailiff and the beer ,</l>
       <l n="23">And thump , thump , goes the farmer 's nag</l>
       <l n="24">o'er the narrow bridge of the weir .</l>
       <l n="25">High up and light are the clouds ,</l>
       <l n="26">and though the swallows flit</l>
       <l n="27">So high o'er the sunlit earth ,</l>
       <l n="28">they are well a part of it ,</l>
       <l n="29">And so , though high over them ,</l>
       <l n="30">are the wings of the wandering herne ;</l>
       <l n="31">In measureless depths above him</l>
       <l n="32">doth the fair sky quiver and burn ;</l>
       <l n="33">The dear sun , floods the land</l>
       <l n="34">as the morning falls toward noon ,</l>
       <l n="35">And a little wind is awake</l>
       <l n="36">in the best of the latter June .</l>
       <l n="37">They are busy winning the hay ,</l>
       <l n="38">and the life and the picture they make ,</l>
       <l n="39">If I were as once I was ,</l>
       <l n="40">I should deem it made for my sake ;</l>
       <l n="41">For here if one need not work</l>
       <l n="42">is a place for happy rest ,</l>
       <l n="43">While one 's thought wends over the world</l>
       <l n="44">north , south , and east and west .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="45">There are the men and the maids ,</l>
       <l n="46">and the wives and the gaffers grey</l>
       <l n="47">Of the fields I know so well ,</l>
       <l n="48">and but little changed are they</l>
       <l n="49">Since I was a lad amongst them ;</l>
       <l n="50">and yet how great is the change !</l>
       <l n="51">Strange are they grown unto me ;</l>
       <l n="52">yea I to myself am strange .</l>
       <l n="53">Their talk and their laughter mingling</l>
       <l n="54">with the music of the meads</l>
       <l n="55">Has now no meaning to me</l>
       <l n="56">to help or to hinder my needs ,</l>
       <l n="57">So far from them have I drifted .</l>
       <l n="58">And yet amidst of them goes</l>
       <l n="59">A part of myself , my boy ,</l>
       <l n="60">and of pleasure and pain he knows ,</l>
       <l n="61">And deems it something strange ,</l>
       <l n="62">when he is other than glad .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Lo now ! the woman that stoops and kisses the face of the lad , And puts a rake in his hand and laughs in his laughing face . Whose is the voice that laughs in the old familiar place ? Whose should it be but my love 's , if my love were yet on the earth ? Could she refrain from the fields where my joy and her joy had birth , When I was there and her child , on the grass that knew her feet ‘ Mid the flowers that led her on when the summer eve was sweet ?</p>
     <p>No , no , it is she no longer ; never again can she come And behold the hay-wains creeping o'er the meadows of her home ; No more can she kiss her son or put the rake in his hand That she handled a while agone in the midst of the haymaking band . Her laughter is gone and her life ; there is no such thing on the earth , No share for me then in the stir , no share in the hurry and mirth .</p>
     <p>Nay , let me look and believe that all these will vanish away , At least when the night has fallen , and that she will be there ‘ mid the hay , Happy and weary with work , waiting and longing for love . There will she be , as of old , when the great moon hung above , And lightless and dead was the village , and nought but the weir was awake ; There will she rise to meet me , and my hands will she hasten to take , And thence shall we wander away , and over the ancient bridge By many a rose-hung hedgerow , till we reach the sun-burnt ridge And the great trench digged by the Romans : there then awhile shall we stand , To watch the dawn come creeping o'er the fragrant lovely land , Till all the world awaketh , and draws us down , we twain , To the deeds of the field and the fold and the merry summer 's gain .</p>
