     <l n="2">Peter , it was not outward cold</l>
     <l n="3">But inward chill thy bosom froze ,</l>
     <l n="4">Made thee deny with falsehood bold</l>
     <l n="5">Thy Lord and Master to his foes .</l>
     <l n="6">When we find cheer at Satan 's fires</l>
     <l n="7">The world is there to work us harm ,</l>
     <l n="8">To deaden all our pure desires</l>
     <l n="9">With its deceitful lure and charm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="10">Peter , the voice of chanticleer</l>
     <l n="11">Fulfilled what Christ had prophesied ;</l>

     <l n="13">From him whom thou hadst just denied !</l>
     <l n="14">Thy burst of penitential grief !</l>
     <l n="15">Heaven those tears did surely send .</l>

    <head>THEY 'RE COMING !</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">They 're coming ! And it seems so long</l>
     <l n="2">Since sadly autumn laid them low .</l>
     <l n="3">They left us with the robin 's song ,</l>
     <l n="4">They left us to the ice and snow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">They 're coming ! So the March wind saith .</l>
     <l n="6">Though singing songs with icy breath ,</l>
     <l n="7">He 's chanting of another May ,</l>
     <l n="8">He 's chanting of King Winter 's death .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">They 're coming ! ‘ Neath the forest 's mold ,</l>
     <l n="10">In mossy beds of ferny soil ,</l>
     <l n="11">Slowly their tiny robes unfold ,</l>
     <l n="12">Yet do they neither spin nor toil .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">They 're coming ! With their influence pure ,</l>
     <l n="14">Their emblematic power again</l>
     <l n="15">Of him who would our steps allure</l>
     <l n="16">To realms of love , devoid of pain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">They 're coming ! With the summer 's breeze ,</l>
     <l n="18">With azure skies and sunny showers ,</l>
     <l n="19">With notes of birds and hum of bees —</l>
     <l n="20">Who will not welcome back the flowers ?</l>
