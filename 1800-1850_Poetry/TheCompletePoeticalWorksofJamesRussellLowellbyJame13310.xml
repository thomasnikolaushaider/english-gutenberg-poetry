      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Gone , gone from us ! and shall we see</l>
       <l n="2">Those sibyl-leaves of destiny ,</l>
       <l n="3">Those calm eyes , nevermore ?</l>
       <l n="4">Those deep , dark eyes so warm and bright ,</l>
       <l n="5">Wherein the fortunes of the man</l>
       <l n="6">Lay slumbering in prophetic light ,</l>
       <l n="7">In characters a child might scan ?</l>
       <l n="8">So bright , and gone forth utterly !</l>
       <l n="9">Oh stern word — Nevermore !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="10">The stars of those two gentle eyes 10</l>
       <l n="11">Will shine no more on earth ;</l>
       <l n="12">Quenched are the hopes that had their birth ,</l>
       <l n="13">As we watched them slowly rise ,</l>
       <l n="14">Stars of a mother 's fate ;</l>
       <l n="15">And she would read them o'er and o'er ,</l>
       <l n="16">Pondering , as she sate ,</l>
       <l n="17">Over their dear astrology ,</l>
       <l n="18">Which she had conned and conned before ,</l>
       <l n="19">Deeming she needs must read aright 19</l>
       <l n="20">What was writ so passing bright .</l>
       <l n="21">And yet , alas ! she knew not why .</l>
       <l n="22">Her voice would falter in its song ,</l>
       <l n="23">And tears would slide from out her eye ,</l>
       <l n="24">Silent , as they were doing wrong .</l>
       <l n="25">Oh stern word — Nevermore !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="26">The tongue that scarce had learned to claim</l>
       <l n="27">An entrance to a mother 's heart</l>
       <l n="28">By that dear talisman , a mother 's name ,</l>
       <l n="29">Sleeps all forgetful of its art !</l>
       <l n="30">I loved to see the infant soul 30</l>
       <l n="31">( How mighty in the weakness</l>
       <l n="32">Of its untutored meekness ! )</l>
       <l n="33">Peep timidly from out its nest ,</l>
       <l n="34">His lips , the while ,</l>
       <l n="35">Fluttering with half-fledged words ,</l>
       <l n="36">Or hushing to a smile</l>
       <l n="37">That more than words expressed ,</l>
       <l n="38">When his glad mother on him stole</l>
       <l n="39">And snatched him to her breast !</l>
       <l n="40">Oh , thoughts were brooding in those eyes , 40</l>
       <l n="41">That would have soared like strong-winged birds</l>
       <l n="42">Far , far into the skies ,</l>
       <l n="43">Gladding the earth with song ,</l>
       <l n="44">And gushing harmonies ,</l>
       <l n="45">Had he but tarried with us long !</l>
       <l n="46">Oh stern word — Nevermore !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="47">How peacefully they rest ,</l>
       <l n="48">Crossfolded there</l>
       <l n="49">Upon his little breast ,</l>
       <l n="50">Those small , white hands that ne'er were still before , 50</l>
       <l n="51">But ever sported with his mother 's hair ,</l>
       <l n="52">Or the plain cross that on her breast she wore !</l>
       <l n="53">Her heart no more will beat</l>
       <l n="54">To feel the touch of that soft palm ,</l>
       <l n="55">That ever seemed a new surprise</l>
       <l n="56">Sending glad thoughts up to her eyes</l>
       <l n="57">To bless him with their holy calm ,—</l>
       <l n="58">Sweet thoughts ! they made her eyes as sweet .</l>
       <l n="59">How quiet are the hands</l>
       <l n="60">That wove those pleasant bands !</l>
       <l n="61">But that they do not rise and sink 61</l>
       <l n="62">With his calm breathing , I should think</l>
       <l n="63">That he were dropped asleep .</l>
       <l n="64">Alas ! too deep , too deep</l>
       <l n="65">Is this his slumber !</l>
       <l n="66">Time scarce can number</l>
       <l n="67">The years ere he shall wake again .</l>
       <l n="68">Oh , may we see his eyelids open then !</l>
       <l n="69">Oh stern word — Nevermore !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="70">As the airy gossamere , 70</l>
       <l n="71">Floating in the sunlight clear ,</l>
       <l n="72">Where'er it toucheth clingeth tightly ,</l>
       <l n="73">Bound glossy leal or stump unsightly ,</l>
       <l n="74">So from his spirit wandered out</l>
       <l n="75">Tendrils spreading all about ,</l>
       <l n="76">Knitting all things to its thrall</l>
       <l n="77">With a perfect love of all :</l>
       <l n="78">Oh stern word — Nevermore !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="79">He did but float a little way</l>
       <l n="80">Adown the stream of time , 80</l>
       <l n="81">With dreamy eyes watching the ripples play ,</l>
       <l n="82">Or hearkening their fairy chime ;</l>
       <l n="83">His slender sail</l>
       <l n="84">Ne'er felt the gale ;</l>
       <l n="85">He did but float a little way ,</l>
       <l n="86">And , putting to the shore</l>
       <l n="87">While yet ‘ t was early day ,</l>
       <l n="88">Went calmly on his way ,</l>
       <l n="89">To dwell with us no more !</l>
       <l n="90">No jarring did he feel , 90</l>
       <l n="91">No grating on his shallop 's keel ;</l>
       <l n="92">A strip of silver sand</l>
       <l n="93">Mingled the waters with the land</l>
       <l n="94">Where he was seen no more :</l>
       <l n="95">Oh stern word — Nevermore !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="96">Full short his journey was ; no dust</l>
       <l n="97">Of earth unto his sandals clave ;</l>
       <l n="98">The weary weight that old men must ,</l>
       <l n="99">He bore not to the grave .</l>
       <l n="100">He seemed a cherub who had lost his way 100</l>
       <l n="101">And wandered hither , so his stay</l>
       <l n="102">With us was short , and ‘ t was most meet</l>
       <l n="103">That he should be no delver in earth 's clod ,</l>
       <l n="104">Nor need to pause and cleanse his feet</l>
       <l n="105">To stand before his God :</l>
       <l n="106">Oh blest word — Evermore !</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The sea is lonely , the sea is dreary ,</l>
       <l n="2">The sea is restless and uneasy ;</l>
       <l n="3">Thou seekest quiet , thou art weary ,</l>
       <l n="4">Wandering thou knowest not whither ;—</l>
       <l n="5">Our little isle is green and breezy ,</l>
       <l n="6">Come and rest thee ! Oh come hither ,</l>
       <l n="7">Come to this peaceful home of ours ,</l>
       <l n="8">Where evermore</l>
       <l n="9">The low west-wind creeps panting up the shore 9</l>
       <l n="10">To be at rest among the flowers ;</l>
       <l n="11">Full of rest , the green moss lifts ,</l>
       <l n="12">As the dark waves of the sea</l>
       <l n="13">Draw in and out of rocky rifts ,</l>
       <l n="14">Calling solemnly to thee</l>
       <l n="15">With voices deep and hollow ,—</l>
       <l n="16">‘ To the shore</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="20">Look how the gray old Ocean 20</l>
       <l n="21">From the depth of his heart rejoices ,</l>
       <l n="22">Heaving with a gentle motion ,</l>
       <l n="23">When he hears our restful voices ;</l>
       <l n="24">List how he sings in an undertone ,</l>
       <l n="25">Chiming with our melody ;</l>
       <l n="26">And all sweet sounds of earth and air</l>
       <l n="27">Melt into one low voice alone ,</l>
       <l n="28">That murmurs over the weary sea ,</l>
       <l n="29">And seems to sing from everywhere ,—</l>
       <l n="30">‘ Here mayst thou harbor peacefully , 30</l>
       <l n="31">Here mayst thou rest from the aching oar ;</l>

       <l n="33">And in our green isle rest forevermore !</l>

       <l n="38">Doubtfully pausing and murmuring still ,</l>
       <l n="39">‘ Evermore ! ’</l>
       <l n="40">Thus , on Life 's weary sea , 40</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Untremulous in the river clear ,</l>
       <l n="2">Toward the sky 's image , hangs the imaged bridge ;</l>
       <l n="3">So still the air that I can hear</l>
       <l n="4">The slender clarion of the unseen midge ;</l>
       <l n="5">Out of the stillness , with a gathering creep ,</l>
       <l n="6">Like rising wind in leaves , which now decreases ,</l>
       <l n="7">Now lulls , now swells , and all the while increases ,</l>
       <l n="8">The huddling trample of a drove of sheep</l>
       <l n="9">Tilts the loose planks , and then as gradually ceases</l>
       <l n="10">In dust on the other side ; life 's emblem deep , 10</l>
       <l n="11">A confused noise between two silences ,</l>
       <l n="12">Finding at last in dust precarious peace .</l>
       <l n="13">On the wide marsh the purple-blossomed grasses</l>
       <l n="14">Soak up the sunshine ; sleeps the brimming tide ,</l>
       <l n="15">Save when the wedge-shaped wake in silence passes</l>
       <l n="16">Of some slow water-rat , whose sinuous glide</l>
       <l n="17">Wavers the sedge 's emerald shade from side to side ;</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="18">But up the west , like a rock-shivered surge ,</l>
       <l n="19">Climbs a great cloud edged with sun-whitened spray ;</l>
       <l n="20">Huge whirls of foam boil toppling o'er its verge , 20</l>
       <l n="21">And falling still it seems , and yet it climbs alway .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">

       <l n="25">Doubtful and slow ,</l>
       <l n="26">Down the pane they are crookedly crawling ,</l>
       <l n="27">And the wind breathes low ;</l>
       <l n="28">Slowly the circles widen on the river ,</l>
       <l n="29">Widen and mingle , one and all ;</l>
       <l n="30">Here and there the slenderer flowers shiver , 30</l>

       <l n="32">Now on the hills I hear the thunder mutter ,</l>

       <l n="35">Then droop to a fitful rest ;</l>
       <l n="36">Up from the stream with sluggish flap</l>
       <l n="37">Struggles the gull and floats away ;</l>
       <l n="38">Nearer and nearer rolls the thunder-clap ,—</l>
       <l n="39">We shall not see the sun go down to-day :</l>
       <l n="40">Now leaps the wind on the sleepy marsh , 40</l>
       <l n="41">And tramples the grass with terrified feet ,</l>
       <l n="42">The startled river turns leaden and harsh ,</l>

       <l n="51">For a breath 's space I see the blue wood again ,</l>

       <l n="56">Through tattered foliage the hail tears crashing ,</l>
       <l n="57">The blue lightning flashes ,</l>
       <l n="58">The rapid hail clashes ,</l>
       <l n="59">The white waves are tumbling ,</l>
       <l n="60">And , in one baffled roar , 60</l>
       <l n="61">Like the toothless sea mumbling</l>
       <l n="62">A rock-bristled shore ,</l>
       <l n="63">The thunder is rumbling</l>
       <l n="64">And crashing and crumbling ,—</l>

       <l n="69">The rain stops short , but from the eaves</l>
       <l n="70">You see it drop , and hear it from the leaves , 70</l>
       <l n="71">All is so bodingly still ;</l>
       <l n="72">Again , now , now , again</l>
       <l n="73">Plashes the rain in heavy gouts ,</l>
       <l n="74">The crinkled lightning</l>

       <l n="78">His battle-song ,—</l>
       <l n="79">One quivering flash ,</l>
       <l n="80">One wildering crash , 80</l>

       <l n="91">The pale and quiet moon</l>
       <l n="92">Makes her calm forehead bare ,</l>

      <head>LOVE</head>
       <l n="1">True Love is but a humble , low-born thing ,</l>
       <l n="2">And hath its food served up in earthen ware ;</l>
       <l n="3">It is a thing to walk with , hand in hand ,</l>
       <l n="4">Through the everydayness of this workday world ,</l>
       <l n="5">Baring its tender feet to every flint ,</l>
       <l n="6">Yet letting not one heart-beat go astray</l>
       <l n="7">From Beauty 's law of plainness and content ;</l>
       <l n="8">A simple , fireside thing , whose quiet smile</l>
       <l n="9">Can warm earth 's poorest hovel to a home ;</l>
       <l n="10">Which , when our autumn cometh , as it must ,</l>
       <l n="11">And life in the chill wind shivers bare and leafless ,</l>
       <l n="12">Shall still be blest with Indian-summer youth</l>
       <l n="13">In bleak November , and , with thankful heart ,</l>
       <l n="14">Smile on its ample stores of garnered fruit ,</l>
       <l n="15">As full of sunshine to our aged eyes</l>
       <l n="16">As when it nursed the blossoms of our spring .</l>
       <l n="17">Such is true Love , which steals into the heart</l>
       <l n="18">With feet as silent as the lightsome dawn</l>
       <l n="19">That kisses smooth the rough brows of the dark ,</l>
       <l n="20">And hath its will through blissful gentleness ,</l>
       <l n="21">Not like a rocket , which , with passionate glare ,</l>
       <l n="22">Whirs suddenly up , then bursts , and leaves the night</l>
       <l n="23">Painfully quivering on the dazèd eyes ;</l>
       <l n="24">A love that gives and takes , that seeth faults ,</l>
       <l n="25">Not with flaw-seeking eyes like needle points ,</l>
       <l n="26">But loving-kindly ever looks them down</l>
       <l n="27">With the o'ercoming faith that still forgives ;</l>
       <l n="28">A love that shall be new and fresh each hour ,</l>
       <l n="29">As is the sunset 's golden mystery ,</l>
       <l n="30">Or the sweet coming of the evening-star ,</l>
       <l n="31">Alike , and yet most unlike , every day ,</l>
       <l n="32">And seeming ever best and fairest now ;</l>
       <l n="33">A love that doth not kneel for what it seeks ,</l>
       <l n="34">But faces Truth and Beauty as their peer ,</l>
       <l n="35">Showing its worthiness of noble thoughts</l>
       <l n="36">By a clear sense of inward nobleness ;</l>
       <l n="37">A love that in its object findeth not</l>
       <l n="38">All grace and beauty , and enough to sate</l>
       <l n="39">Its thirst of blessing , but , in all of good</l>
       <l n="40">Found there , sees but the Heaven-implanted types</l>
       <l n="41">Of good and beauty in the soul of man ,</l>
       <l n="42">And traces , in the simplest heart that beats ,</l>
       <l n="43">A family-likeness to its chosen one ,</l>
       <l n="44">That claims of it the rights of brotherhood .</l>
       <l n="45">For love is blind but with the fleshly eye ,</l>
       <l n="46">That so its inner sight may be more clear ;</l>
       <l n="47">And outward shows of beauty only so</l>
       <l n="48">Are needful at the first , as is a hand</l>
       <l n="49">To guide and to uphold an infant 's steps :</l>
       <l n="50">Fine natures need them not : their earnest look</l>
       <l n="51">Pierces the body 's mask of thin disguise ,</l>
       <l n="52">And beauty ever is to them revealed ,</l>
       <l n="53">Behind the unshapeliest , meanest lump of clay ,</l>
       <l n="54">With arms outstretched and eager face ablaze ,</l>
       <l n="55">Yearning to be but understood and loved .</l>

      <head>THE MOON</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">My soul was like the sea .</l>
       <l n="2">Before the moon was made ,</l>
       <l n="3">Moaning in vague immensity ,</l>
       <l n="4">Of its own strength afraid ,</l>
       <l n="5">Unresful and unstaid .</l>
       <l n="6">Through every rift it foamed in vain ,</l>
       <l n="7">About its earthly prison ,</l>
       <l n="8">Seeking some unknown thing in pain ,</l>
       <l n="9">And sinking restless back again ,</l>
       <l n="10">For yet no moon had risen :</l>
       <l n="11">Its only voice a vast dumb moan ,</l>
       <l n="12">Of utterless anguish speaking ,</l>
       <l n="13">It lay unhopefully alone ,</l>
       <l n="14">And lived but in an aimless seeking .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="15">So was my soul ; but when ‘ twas full</l>
       <l n="16">Of unrest to o'erloading ,</l>
       <l n="17">A voice of something beautiful</l>
       <l n="18">Whispered a dim foreboding ,</l>
       <l n="19">And yet so soft , so sweet , so low ,</l>
       <l n="20">It had not more of joy than woe ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="21">And , as the sea doth oft lie still ,</l>
       <l n="22">Making its waters meet ,</l>
       <l n="23">As if by an unconscious will ,</l>
       <l n="24">For the moon 's silver feet ,</l>
       <l n="25">So lay my soul within mine eyes</l>
       <l n="26">When thou , its guardian moon , didst rise .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="27">And now , howe'er its waves above</l>
       <l n="28">May toss and seem uneaseful ,</l>
       <l n="29">One strong , eternal law of Love ,</l>
       <l n="30">With guidance sure and peaceful ,</l>
       <l n="31">As calm and natural as breath ,</l>
       <l n="32">Moves its great deeps through life and death .</l>

        <l n="1">In the old days of awe and keen-eyed wonder ,</l>
        <l n="2">The Poet 's song with blood-warm truth was rife ;</l>
        <l n="3">He saw the mysteries which circle under</l>
        <l n="4">The outward shell and skin of daily life .</l>
        <l n="5">Nothing to him were fleeting time and fashion ,</l>
        <l n="6">His soul was led by the eternal law ;</l>
        <l n="7">There was in him no hope of fame , no passion ,</l>
        <l n="8">But with calm , godlike eyes he only saw .</l>
        <l n="9">He did not sigh o'er heroes dead and buried ,</l>
        <l n="10">Chief-mourner at the Golden Age 's hearse , 10</l>
        <l n="11">Nor deem that souls whom Charon grim had ferried</l>
        <l n="12">Alone were fitting themes of epic verse :</l>
        <l n="13">He could believe the promise of to-morrow ,</l>
        <l n="14">And feel the wondrous meaning of to-day ;</l>
        <l n="15">He had a deeper faith in holy sorrow</l>
        <l n="16">Than the world 's seeming loss could take away .</l>
        <l n="17">To know the heart of all things was his duty ,</l>
        <l n="18">All things did sing to him to make him wise ,</l>
        <l n="19">And , with a sorrowful and conquering beauty ,</l>
        <l n="20">The soul of all looked grandly from his eyes . 20</l>
        <l n="21">He gazed on all within him and without him ,</l>
        <l n="22">He watched the flowing of Time 's steady tide ,</l>
        <l n="23">And shapes of glory floated all about him</l>
        <l n="24">And whispered to him , and he prophesied .</l>
        <l n="25">Than all men he more fearless was and freer ,</l>
        <l n="26">And all his brethren cried with one accord ,—</l>
        <l n="27">‘ Behold the holy man ! Behold the Seer !</l>
        <l n="28">Him who hath spoken with the unseen Lord ! ’</l>
        <l n="29">He to his heart with large embrace had taken</l>
        <l n="30">The universal sorrow of mankind , 30</l>
        <l n="31">And , from that root , a shelter never shaken ,</l>
        <l n="32">The tree of wisdom grew with sturdy rind .</l>
        <l n="33">He could interpret well the wondrous voices</l>
        <l n="34">Which to the calm and silent spirit come ;</l>
        <l n="35">He knew that the One Soul no more rejoices</l>
        <l n="36">In the star 's anthem than the insect 's hum .</l>
        <l n="37">He in his heart was ever meek and humble .</l>
        <l n="38">And yet with kingly pomp his numbers ran ,</l>
        <l n="39">As he foresaw how all things false should crumble</l>
        <l n="40">Before the free , uplifted soul of man ; 40</l>
        <l n="41">And , when he was made full to overflowing</l>
        <l n="42">With all the loveliness of heaven and earth ,</l>
        <l n="43">Out rushed his song , like molten iron glowing ,</l>
        <l n="44">To show God sitting by the humblest hearth .</l>
        <l n="45">With calmest courage he was ever ready</l>
        <l n="46">To teach that action was the truth of thought ,</l>
        <l n="47">And , with strong arm and purpose firm and steady ,</l>
        <l n="48">An anchor for the drifting world he wrought .</l>
        <l n="49">So did he make the meanest man partaker</l>
        <l n="50">Of all his brother-gods unto him gave ; 50</l>
        <l n="51">All souls did reverence him and name him Maker ,</l>
        <l n="52">And when he died heaped temples on his grave .</l>
        <l n="53">And still his deathless words of light are swimming</l>
        <l n="54">Serene throughout the great deep infinite</l>
        <l n="55">Of human soul , unwaning and undimming ,</l>

        <l n="151">Too long hath it been patient with the grating</l>
        <l n="152">Of scrannel-pipes , and heard it misnamed Art .</l>
        <l n="153">To him the smiling soul of man shall listen ,</l>

        <l n="157">His verse shall have a great commanding motion ,</l>
        <l n="158">Heaving and swelling with a melody</l>

        <l n="162">To make us feel the soul once more sublime ,</l>
        <l n="163">We are of far too infinite an essence</l>
        <l n="164">To rest contented with the lies of Time .</l>

       <l n="100">Who speaks the truth stabs Falsehood to the heart , 100</l>
       <l n="101">And his mere word makes despots tremble more</l>
       <l n="102">Than ever Brutus with his dagger could .</l>
       <l n="103">Wait for no hints from waterfalls or woods ,</l>
       <l n="104">Nor dream that tales of red men , brute and fierce ,</l>
       <l n="105">Repay the finding of this Western World ,</l>
       <l n="106">Or needed half the globe to give them birth :</l>
       <l n="107">Spirit supreme of Freedom ! not for this</l>
       <l n="108">Did great Columbus tame his eagle soul</l>
       <l n="109">To jostle with the daws that perch in courts ;</l>
       <l n="110">Not for this , friendless , on an unknown sea , 110</l>
       <l n="111">Coping with mad waves and more mutinous spirits ,</l>
       <l n="112">Battled he with the dreadful ache at heart</l>
       <l n="113">Which tempts , with devilish subtleties of doubt ,</l>
       <l n="114">The hermit , of that loneliest solitude ,</l>
       <l n="115">The silent desert of a great New Thought ;</l>
       <l n="116">Though loud Niagara were to-day struck dumb ,</l>
       <l n="117">Yet would this cataract of boiling life</l>
       <l n="118">Rush plunging on and on to endless deeps ,</l>
       <l n="119">And utter thunder till the world shall cease ,—</l>
       <l n="120">A thunder worthy of the poet 's song , 120</l>
       <l n="121">And which alone can fill it with true life .</l>
       <l n="122">The high evangel to our country granted</l>
       <l n="123">Could make apostles , yea , with tongues of fire ,</l>
       <l n="124">Of hearts half-darkened back again to clay !</l>
       <l n="125">‘ Tis the soul only that is national ,</l>
       <l n="126">And he who pays true loyalty to that</l>
       <l n="127">Alone can claim the wreath of patriotism .</l>

       <l n="128">Beloved ! if I wander far and oft</l>
       <l n="129">From that which I believe , and feel , and know ,</l>
       <l n="130">Thou wilt forgive , not with a sorrowing heart , 130</l>
       <l n="131">But with a strengthened hope of better things ;</l>
       <l n="132">Knowing that I , though often blind and false</l>
       <l n="133">To those I love , and oh , more false than all</l>
       <l n="134">Unto myself , have been most true to thee ,</l>
       <l n="135">And that whoso in one thing hath been true</l>

       <l n="36">A youth named Rhoecus , wandering in the wood ,</l>

       <l n="38">And , feeling pity of so fair a tree ,</l>
       <l n="39">He propped its gray trunk with admiring care ,</l>
       <l n="40">And with a thoughtless footstep loitered on . 40</l>
       <l n="41">But , as he turned , he heard a voice behind</l>
       <l n="42">That murmured ‘ Rhoecus ! ’ ‘ Twas as if the leaves ,</l>
       <l n="43">Stirred by a passing breath , had murmured it ,</l>
       <l n="44">And , while he paused bewildered , yet again</l>
       <l n="45">It murmured ‘ Rhoecus ! ’ softer than a breeze .</l>
       <l n="46">He started and beheld with dizzy eyes</l>
       <l n="47">What seemed the substance of a happy dream</l>
       <l n="48">Stand there before him , spreading a warm glow</l>
       <l n="49">Within the green glooms of the shadowy oak .</l>
       <l n="50">It seemed a woman 's shape , yet far too fair 50</l>
       <l n="51">To be a woman , and with eyes too meek</l>
       <l n="52">For any that were wont to mate with gods .</l>
       <l n="53">All naked like a goddess stood she there ,</l>
       <l n="54">And like a goddess all too beautiful</l>
       <l n="55">To feel the guilt-born earthliness of shame .</l>
       <l n="56">‘ Rhoecus , I am the Dryad of this tree , ’</l>
       <l n="57">Thus she began , dropping her low-toned words</l>
       <l n="58">Serene , and full , and clear , as drops of dew ,</l>
       <l n="59">‘ And with it I am doomed to live and die ;</l>
       <l n="60">The rain and sunshine are my caterers , 60</l>
       <l n="61">Nor have I other bliss than simple life ;</l>
       <l n="62">Now ask me what thou wilt , that I can give ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="64">Then Rhoecus , with a flutter at the heart ,</l>
       <l n="65">Yet by the prompting of such beauty bold ,</l>
       <l n="66">Answered : ‘ What is there that can satisfy</l>
       <l n="67">The endless craving of the soul but love ?</l>
       <l n="68">Give me thy love , or but the hope of that</l>
       <l n="69">Which must be evermore my nature 's goal . ’</l>
       <l n="70">After a little pause she said again ,</l>
       <l n="71">But with a glimpse of sadness in her tone , 71</l>
       <l n="72">‘ I give it , Rhoecus , though a perilous gift ;</l>
       <l n="73">An hour before the sunset meet me here . ’</l>
       <l n="74">And straightway there was nothing he could see</l>
       <l n="75">But the green glooms beneath the shadowy oak ,</l>
       <l n="76">And not a sound came to his straining ears</l>
       <l n="77">But the low trickling rustle of the leaves ,</l>
       <l n="78">And far away upon an emerald slope</l>
       <l n="79">The falter of an idle shepherd 's pipe .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">

       <l n="85">To be the guerdon of a daring heart .</l>
       <l n="86">So Rhoecus made no doubt that he was blest ,</l>

       <l n="88">Earth seemed to spring beneath him as he walked ,</l>

       <l n="90">And he could scarce believe he had not wings , 90</l>
       <l n="91">Such sunshine seemed to glitter through his veins</l>

       <l n="96">Chance gave of joy , was wholly bound in that ,</l>
       <l n="97">Like the contented peasant of a vale ,</l>
       <l n="98">Deemed it the world , and never looked beyond .</l>
       <l n="99">So , haply meeting in the afternoon</l>
       <l n="100">Some comrades who were playing at the dice , 100</l>

       <l n="104">Just laughed in triumph at a happy throw ,</l>
       <l n="105">When through the room there hummed a yellow bee</l>
       <l n="106">That buzzed about his ear with down-dropped legs</l>
       <l n="107">As if to light . And Rhoecus laughed and said ,</l>
       <l n="108">Feeling how red and flushed he was with loss ,</l>
       <l n="109">‘ By Venus ! does he take me for a rose ? ’</l>
       <l n="110">And brushed him off with rough , impatient hand . 110</l>
       <l n="111">But still the bee came back , and thrice again</l>
       <l n="112">Rhoecus did beat him off with growing wrath .</l>
       <l n="113">Then through the window flew the wounded bee ,</l>
       <l n="114">And Rhoecus , tracking him with angry eyes ,</l>
       <l n="115">Saw a sharp mountain-peak of Thessaly</l>
       <l n="116">Against the red disk of the setting sun ,—</l>
       <l n="117">And instantly the blood sank from his heart ,</l>
       <l n="118">As if its very walls had caved away .</l>
       <l n="119">Without a word he turned , and , rushing forth ,</l>
       <l n="120">Ran madly through the city and the gate , 120</l>
       <l n="121">And o'er the plain , which now the wood 's long shade ,</l>
       <l n="122">By the low sun thrown forward broad and dim ,</l>
       <l n="123">Darkened wellnigh unto the city 's wall .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="124">Quite spent and out of breath he reached the tree ,</l>
       <l n="125">And , listening fearfully , he heard once more</l>
       <l n="126">The low voice murmur ‘ Rhoecus ! ’ close at hand :</l>
       <l n="127">Whereat he looked around him , but could see</l>
       <l n="128">Naught but the deepening glooms beneath the oak .</l>
       <l n="129">Then sighed the voice , ‘ O Rhoecus ! nevermore</l>
       <l n="130">Shalt thou behold me or by day or night , 130</l>
       <l n="131">Me , who would fain have blessed thee with a love</l>

       <l n="133">Filled up with nectar any mortal heart :</l>
       <l n="134">But thou didst scorn my humble messenger ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="141">Then Rhoecus beat his breast , and groaned aloud ,</l>

       <l n="143">This once , and I shall never need it more ! ’</l>

       <l n="157">With all its bright sublimity of stars ,</l>
       <l n="158">Deepened , and on his forehead smote the breeze :</l>

       <l n="160">But from that eve he was alone on earth . 160</l>

       <l n="209">And he who waits to have his task marked out</l>
       <l n="210">Shall die and leave his errand unfulfilled .</l>
       <l n="211">Our time is one that calls for earnest deeds ; 210</l>
       <l n="212">Season and Government , like two broad seas ,</l>
       <l n="213">Yearn for each other with outstretched arms</l>
       <l n="214">Across this narrow isthmus of the throne ,</l>
       <l n="215">And roll their white surf higher every day .</l>
       <l n="216">One age moves onward , and the next builds up</l>
       <l n="217">Cities and gorgeous palaces , where stood</l>
       <l n="218">The rude log-huts of those who tamed the wild ,</l>
       <l n="219">Rearing from out the forests they had felled</l>

       <l n="221">The builder 's trowel and the settler 's axe 220</l>

       <l n="223">Ours is the harder task , yet not the less</l>
       <l n="224">Shall we receive the blessing for our toil</l>
       <l n="225">From the choice spirits of the aftertime .</l>
       <l n="226">My soul is not a palace of the past ,</l>
       <l n="227">Where outworn creeds , like Rome 's gray senate , quake ,</l>
       <l n="228">Hearing afar the Vandal 's trumpet hoarse ,</l>
       <l n="229">That shakes old systems with a thunder-fit .</l>
       <l n="230">That time is ripe , and rotten-ripe , for change ;</l>

       <l n="232">Is called for by the instinct of mankind ;</l>
       <l n="233">Nor think I that God 's world will fall apart</l>
       <l n="234">Because we tear a parchment more or less .</l>
       <l n="235">Truth Is eternal , but her effluence ,</l>
       <l n="236">With endless change , is fitted to the hour ;</l>
       <l n="237">Her mirror is turned forward to reflect</l>
       <l n="238">The promise of the future , not the past .</l>
       <l n="239">He who would win the name of truly great</l>

       <l n="241">And make the present ready to fulfil 240</l>

       <l n="243">Gently and peacefully , as wave with wave .</l>
       <l n="244">The future works out great men 's purposes ;</l>
       <l n="245">The present is enough , for common souls ,</l>
       <l n="246">Who , never looking forward , are indeed</l>

       <l n="248">Are petrified forever ; better those</l>

       <l n="250">From out the pathless desert where he gropes ,</l>
       <l n="251">And set him onward in his darksome way , 250</l>
       <l n="252">I do not fear to follow out the truth ,</l>
       <l n="253">Albeit along the precipice 's edge .</l>
       <l n="254">Let us speak plain : there is more force in names</l>
       <l n="255">Than most men dream of ; and a lie may keep</l>
       <l n="256">Its throne a whole age longer , if it skulk</l>

       <l n="258">Let us call tyrants tyrants , and maintain</l>
       <l n="259">That only freedom comes by grace of God ,</l>
       <l n="260">And all that comes not by his grace must fail ;</l>
       <l n="261">For men in earnest have no time to waste 260</l>

       <l n="24">Alone , beside a lake , their wigwam stood , 20</l>
       <l n="25">Far from the other dwellings of their tribe :</l>
       <l n="26">And , after many moons , the loneliness</l>
       <l n="27">Wearied the elder brother , and he said ,</l>
       <l n="28">‘ Why should I dwell here far from men , shut out</l>
       <l n="29">From the free , natural joys that fit my age ?</l>
       <l n="30">Lo , I am tall and strong , well skilled to hunt ,</l>
       <l n="31">Patient of toil and hunger , and not yet</l>
       <l n="32">Have seen the danger which I dared not look</l>
       <l n="33">Full in the face ; what hinders me to be</l>
       <l n="34">A mighty Brave and Chief among my kin ? ’ 30</l>
       <l n="35">So , taking up his arrows and his bow ,</l>
       <l n="36">As if to hunt , he journeyed swiftly on ,</l>
       <l n="37">Until he gained the wigwams of his tribe ,</l>
       <l n="38">Where , choosing out a bride , he soon forgot ,</l>
       <l n="39">In all the fret and bustle of new life ,</l>
       <l n="40">The little Sheemah and his father 's charge .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="41">Now when the sister found her brother gone ,</l>
       <l n="42">And that , for many days , he came not back ,</l>
       <l n="43">She wept for Sheemah more than for herself ;</l>
       <l n="44">For Love bides longest in a woman 's heart , 40</l>
       <l n="45">And flutters many times before he flies ,</l>
       <l n="46">And then doth perch so nearly , that a word</l>
       <l n="47">May lure him back to his accustomed nest ;</l>
       <l n="48">And Duty lingers even when Love is gone ,</l>
       <l n="49">Oft looking out in hope of his return ;</l>
       <l n="50">And , after Duty hath been driven forth ,</l>
       <l n="51">Then Selfishness creeps in the last of all ,</l>
       <l n="52">Warming her lean hands at the lonely hearth ,</l>
       <l n="53">And crouching o'er the embers , to shut out</l>
       <l n="54">Whatever paltry warmth and light are left , 50</l>
       <l n="55">With avaricious greed , from all beside .</l>
       <l n="56">So , for long months , the sister hunted wide ,</l>
       <l n="57">And cared for little Sheemah tenderly ;</l>
       <l n="58">But , daily more and more , the loneliness</l>
       <l n="59">Grew wearisome , and to herself she sighed ,</l>
       <l n="60">‘ Am I not fair ? at least the glassy pool ,</l>
       <l n="61">That hath no cause to flatter , tells me so ;</l>
       <l n="62">But , oh , how flat and meaningless the tale ,</l>
       <l n="63">Unless it tremble on a lover 's tongue !</l>
       <l n="64">Beauty hath no true glass , except it be 60</l>
       <l n="65">In the sweet privacy of loving eyes . ’</l>
       <l n="66">Thus deemed she idly , and forgot the lore</l>
       <l n="67">Which she had learned of nature and the woods ,</l>
       <l n="68">That beauty 's chief reward is to itself ,</l>
       <l n="69">And that Love 's mirror holds no image long</l>
       <l n="70">Save of the inward fairness , blurred and lost</l>
       <l n="71">Unless kept clear and white by Duty 's care .</l>
       <l n="72">So she went forth and sought the haunts of men ,</l>
       <l n="73">And , being wedded , in her household cares ,</l>
       <l n="74">Soon , like the elder brother , quite forgot 70</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="76">But Sheemah , left alone within the lodge ,</l>

       <l n="78">Thinking each rustle was his sister 's step ,</l>
       <l n="79">Till hope grew less and less , and then went out ,</l>
       <l n="80">And every sound was changed from hope to fear .</l>
       <l n="81">Few sounds there were :— the dropping of a nut ,</l>
       <l n="82">The squirrel 's chirrup , and the jay 's harsh scream ,</l>
       <l n="83">Autumn 's sad remnants of blithe Summer 's cheer ,</l>

       <l n="86">Soon what small store his sister left was gone ,</l>
       <l n="87">And , through the Autumn , he made shift to live</l>
       <l n="88">On roots and berries , gathered in much fear</l>
       <l n="89">Of wolves , whose ghastly howl he heard ofttimes ,</l>
       <l n="90">Hollow and hungry , at the dead of night .</l>
       <l n="91">But Winter came at last , and , when the snow ,</l>
       <l n="92">Thick-heaped for gleaming leagues o'er hill and plain ,</l>
       <l n="93">Spread its unbroken silence over all ,</l>
       <l n="94">Made bold by hunger , he was fain to glean 90</l>
       <l n="95">( More sick at heart than Ruth , and all alone )</l>
       <l n="96">After the harvest of the merciless wolf ,</l>
       <l n="97">Grim Boaz , who , sharp-ribbed and gaunt , yet feared</l>
       <l n="98">A thing more wild and starving than himself ;</l>
       <l n="99">Till , by degrees , the wolf and he grew friends ,</l>
       <l n="100">And shared together all the winter through .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="101">Late in the Spring , when all the ice was gone ,</l>
       <l n="102">The elder brother , fishing in the lake ,</l>
       <l n="103">Upon whose edge his father 's wigwam stood ,</l>
       <l n="104">Heard a low moaning noise upon the shore : 100</l>
       <l n="105">Half like a child it seemed , half like a wolf ,</l>
       <l n="106">And straightway there was something in his heart</l>
       <l n="107">That said , ‘ It is thy brother Sheemah 's voice . ’</l>
       <l n="108">So , paddling swiftly to the bank , he saw ,</l>
       <l n="109">Within a little thicket close at hand ,</l>
       <l n="110">A child that seemed fast clinging to a wolf ,</l>
       <l n="111">From the neck downward , gray with shaggy hair ,</l>
       <l n="112">That still crept on and upward as he looked .</l>
       <l n="113">The face was turned away , but well he knew</l>
       <l n="114">That it was Sheemah 's , even his brother 's face . 110</l>
       <l n="115">Then with his trembling hands he hid his eyes ,</l>
       <l n="116">And bowed his head , so that he might not see</l>
       <l n="117">The first look of his brother 's eyes , and cried ,</l>
       <l n="118">‘ O Sheemah ! O my brother , speak to me !</l>
       <l n="119">Dost thou not know me , that I am thy brother ?</l>
       <l n="120">Come to me , little Sheemah , thou shall dwell</l>
       <l n="121">With me henceforth , and know no care or want ! ’</l>
       <l n="122">Sheemah was silent for a space , as if</l>
       <l n="123">‘ T were hard to summon up a human voice ,</l>
       <l n="124">And , when he spake , the voice was as a wolf 's : 120</l>
       <l n="125">‘ I know thee not , nor art thou what thou say'st ;</l>
       <l n="126">I have none other brethren than the wolves ,</l>
       <l n="127">And , till thy heart be changed from what it is ,</l>
       <l n="128">Thou art not worthy to be called their kin . ’</l>
       <l n="129">Then groaned the other , with a choking tongue ,</l>
       <l n="130">‘ Alas ! my heart is changed right bitterly ;</l>
       <l n="131">‘ Tis shrunk and parched within me even now ! ’</l>
       <l n="132">And , looking upward fearfully , he saw</l>
       <l n="133">Only a wolf that shrank away , and ran ,</l>
       <l n="134">Ugly and fierce , to hide among the woods . 130</l>

      <head>AN INCIDENT OF THE FIRE AT HAMBURG</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The tower of old Saint Nicholas soared upward to the skies ,</l>
       <l n="2">Like some huge piece of Nature 's make , the growth of centuries ;</l>
       <l n="3">You could not deem its crowding spires a work of human art ,</l>

       <l n="7">And as from acorn springs the oak , so , freely and alone ,</l>

       <l n="9">It seemed a wondrous freak of chance , so perfect , yet so rough ,</l>

       <l n="11">The thick spires yearned towards the sky in quaint harmonious lines ,</l>

       <l n="27">He could not fear , for surely God a pathway would unfold</l>
       <l n="28">Through this red sea for faithful hearts , as once He did of old .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="29">But scarcely can he cross himself , or on his good saint call ,</l>
       <l n="30">Before the sacrilegious flood o'erleaped the churchyard wall ;</l>
       <l n="31">And , ere a pater half was said , mid smoke and crackling glare ,</l>
       <l n="32">His island tower scarce juts its head above the wide despair .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="33">Upon the peril 's desperate peak his heart stood up sublime ;</l>
       <l n="34">His first thought was for God above , his next was for his chime ;</l>
       <l n="35">‘ Sing now and make your voices heard in hymns of praise , ’ cried he ,</l>
       <l n="36">‘ As did the Israelites of old , safe walking through the sea !</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="37">‘ Through this red sea our God hath made the pathway safe to shore ;</l>

       <l n="39">And as the tower came crashing down , the bells , in clear accord ,</l>
       <l n="40">Pealed forth the grand old German hymn ,— ‘ All good souls , praise the</l>

      <head>THE GROWTH OF THE LEGEND</head>
      <head>A FRAGMENT</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">A legend that grew in the forest 's hush</l>
       <l n="2">Slowly as tear-drops gather and gush ,</l>
       <l n="3">When a word some poet chanced to say</l>
       <l n="4">Ages ago , in his careless way ,</l>
       <l n="5">Brings our youth back to us out of its shroud</l>
       <l n="6">Clearly as under yon thunder-cloud</l>
       <l n="7">I see that white sea-gull . It grew and grew ,</l>
       <l n="8">From the pine-trees gathering a sombre hue ,</l>
       <l n="9">Till it seems a mere murmur out of the vast</l>
       <l n="10">Norwegian forests of the past ; 10</l>
       <l n="11">And it grew itself like a true Northern pine ,</l>
       <l n="12">First a little slender line ,</l>
       <l n="13">Like a mermaid 's green eyelash , and then anon</l>
       <l n="14">A stem that a tower might rest upon ,</l>
       <l n="15">Standing spear-straight in the waist-deep moss ,</l>
       <l n="16">Its bony roots clutching around and across ,</l>
       <l n="17">As if they would tear up earth 's heart in their grasp</l>
       <l n="18">Ere the storm should uproot them or make them unclasp ;</l>
       <l n="19">Its cloudy boughs singing , as suiteth the pine ,</l>
       <l n="20">To snow-bearded sea-kings old songs of the brine , 20</l>
       <l n="21">Till they straightened and let their staves fall to the floor ,</l>
       <l n="22">Hearing waves moan again on the perilous shore</l>
       <l n="23">Of Vinland , perhaps , while their prow groped its way</l>
       <l n="24">‘ Twixt the frothed gnashing tusks of some ship-crunching bay .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="25">So , pine-like , the legend grew , strong-limbed and tall ,</l>
       <l n="26">As the Gypsy child grows that eats crusts in the hall ;</l>
       <l n="27">It sucked the whole strength of the earth and the sky ,</l>
       <l n="28">Spring , Summer , Fall , Winter , all brought it supply ;</l>
       <l n="29">‘ Twas a natural growth , and stood fearlessly there ,</l>
       <l n="30">True part of the landscape as sea , land , and air ; 30</l>
       <l n="31">For it grew in good times , ere the fashion it was</l>
       <l n="32">To force these wild births of the woods under glass ,</l>
       <l n="33">And so , if ‘ tis told as it should be told ,</l>
       <l n="34">Though ‘ twere sung under Venice 's moonlight of gold ,</l>
       <l n="35">You would hear the old voice of its mother , the pine ,</l>
       <l n="36">Murmur sealike and northern through every line ,</l>
       <l n="37">And the verses should grow , self-sustained and free ,</l>
       <l n="38">Round the vibrating stem of the melody ,</l>
       <l n="39">Like the lithe moonlit limbs of the parent tree .</l>

       <l n="40">Yes , the pine is the mother of legends ; what food 40</l>

       <l n="43">Light , sinewy , graceful , firm-set as the wing</l>
       <l n="44">From Michael 's white shoulder , is hewn and defaced</l>
       <l n="45">By iconoclast axes in desperate waste ,</l>
       <l n="46">And its wrecks seek the ocean it prophesied long ,</l>
       <l n="47">Cassandra-like , crooning its mystical song ?</l>
       <l n="48">Then the legends go with them ,— even yet on the sea</l>
       <l n="49">A wild virtue is left in the touch of the tree ,</l>
       <l n="50">And the sailor 's night-watches are thrilled to the core 50</l>

       <l n="52">Yes , wherever the pine-wood has never let in ,</l>
       <l n="53">Since the day of creation , the light and the din</l>
       <l n="54">Of manifold life , but has safely conveyed</l>
       <l n="55">From the midnight primeval its armful of shade ,</l>

       <l n="1">Death never came so nigh to me before ,</l>
       <l n="2">Nor showed me his mild face : oft had I mused</l>
       <l n="3">Of calm and peace and safe forgetfulness ,</l>
       <l n="4">Of folded hands , closed eyes , and heart at rest ,</l>
       <l n="5">And slumber sound beneath a flowery turf ,</l>
       <l n="6">Of faults forgotten , and an inner place</l>
       <l n="7">Kept sacred for us in the heart of friends ;</l>
       <l n="8">But these were idle fancies , satisfied</l>
       <l n="9">With the mere husk of this great mystery ,</l>
       <l n="10">And dwelling in the outward shows of things . 10</l>
       <l n="11">Heaven is not mounted to on wings of dreams ,</l>
       <l n="12">Nor doth the unthankful happiness of youth</l>
       <l n="13">Aim thitherward , but floats from bloom to bloom ,</l>

       <l n="16">Whose golden rounds are our calamities ,</l>
       <l n="17">Whereon our firm feet planting , nearer God</l>

       <l n="22">Sorrow and sickness , poverty and death ,</l>
       <l n="23">One after other lift their frowning masks ,</l>
       <l n="24">And we behold the seraph 's face beneath ,</l>
       <l n="25">All radiant with the glory and the calm</l>
       <l n="26">Of having looked upon the front of God .</l>
       <l n="27">With every anguish of our earthly part</l>

       <l n="35">To destinies of more rewarded toil .</l>
       <l n="36">In the hushed chamber , sitting by the dead ,</l>
       <l n="37">It grates on us to hear the flood of life</l>
       <l n="38">Whirl rustling onward , senseless of our loss .</l>
       <l n="39">The bee hums on ; around the blossomed vine</l>
       <l n="40">Whirs the light humming-bird ; the cricket chirps ; 40</l>
       <l n="41">The locust 's shrill alarum stings the ear ;</l>
       <l n="42">Hard by , the cock shouts lustily ; from farm to farm ,</l>

     <p>THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL</p>
     <p>According to the mythology of the Romancers , the San Greal , or Holy Grail , was the cup out of which Jesus partook of the Last Supper with his disciples . It was brought into England by Joseph of Arimathea , and remained there , an object of pilgrimage and adoration , for many years in the keeping of his lineal descendants . It was incumbent upon those who had charge of it to be chaste in thought , word , and deed ; but one of the keepers having broken this condition , the Holy Grail disappeared . From that time it was a favorite enterprise of the knights of Arthur 's court to go in search of it . Sir Galahad was at last successful in finding it , as may be read in the seventeenth book of the Romance of King Arthur . Tennyson has made Sir Galahad the subject of one of the most exquisite of his poems .</p>
     <p>The plot ( if I may give that name to anything so slight ) of the following poem is my own , and , to serve its purposes , I have enlarged the circle of competition in search of the miraculous cup in such a manner as to include , not only other persons than the heroes of the Round Table , but also a period of time subsequent to the supposed date of King Arthur 's reign .</p>

      <head>G. P . PUTNAM , BROADWAY .</head>
       <l n="1">It being the commonest mode of procedure , I premise a few candid remarks</l>
     </lg>
     <p>TO THE READER :—</p>
     <p>This trifle , begun to please only myself and my own private fancy , was laid on the shelf . But some friends , who had seen it , induced me , by dint of saying they liked it , to put it in print . That is , having come to that very conclusion , I asked their advice when ‘ twould make no confusion . For though ( in the gentlest of ways ) they had hinted it was scarce worth the while , I should doubtless have printed it .</p>
     <p>I began it , intending a Fable , a frail , slender thing , rhymeywinged , with a sting in its tail . But , by addings and alterings not previously planned , digressions chance-hatched , like birds ’ eggs in the sand , and dawdlings to suit every whimsey 's demand ( always freeing the bird which I held In my hand , for the two perched , perhaps out of reach , in the tree ) ,— it grew by degrees to the size which you see . I was like the old woman that carried the calf , and my neighbors , like hers , no doubt , wonder and laugh ; and when , my strained arms with their grown burthen full , I call it my Fable , they call it a bull .</p>
     <p>Having scrawled at full gallop ( as far as that goes ) in a style that is neither good verse nor bad prose , and being a person whom nobody knows , some people will say I am rather more free with my readers than it is becoming to be , that I seem to expect them to wait on my leisure in following wherever I wander at pleasure , that , in short , I take more than a young author 's lawful ease , and laugh in a queer way so like Mephistopheles , that the Public will doubt , as they grope through my rhythm , if in truth I am making fun of them or with them .</p>
     <p>So the excellent Public is hereby assured that the sale of my book is already secured . For there is not a poet throughout the whole land but will purchase a copy or two out of hand , in the fond expectation of being amused in it , by seeing his betters cut up and abused in it . Now , I find , by a pretty exact calculation , there are something like ten thousand bards in the nation , of that special variety whom the Review and Magazine critics call lofty and true , and about thirty thousand ( this tribe is increasing ) of the kinds who are termed full of promise and pleasing . The Public will see by a glance at this schedule , that they cannot expect me to be over-sedulous about courting them , since it seems I have got enough fuel made sure of for boiling my pot .</p>
     <p>As for such of our poets as find not their names mentioned once in my pages , with praises or blames , let them SEND IN THEIR CARDS , without further DELAY , to my friend G. P . PUTNAM , Esquire , in Broadway , where a LIST will be kept with the strictest regard to the day and the hour of receiving the card . Then , taking them up as I chance to have time ( that is , if their names can be twisted in rhyme ) , I will honestly give each his PROPER POSITION , at the rate of ONE AUTHOR to each NEW EDITION . Thus a PREMIUM is offered sufficiently HIGH ( as the magazines say when they tell their best lie ) to induce bards to CLUB their resources and buy the balance of every edition , until they have all of them fairly been run through the mill .</p>
     <p>One word to such readers ( judicious and wise ) as read books with something behind the mere eyes , of whom in the country , perhaps , there are two , including myself , gentle reader , and you . All the characters sketched in this slight jeu d'esprit , though , it may be , they seem , here and there , rather free , and drawn from a somewhat too cynical standpoint , are meant to be faithful , for that is the grand point , and none but an owl would feel sore at a rub from a jester who tells you , without any subterfuge , that he sits in Diogenes ’ tub .</p>
     <p>A PRELIMINARY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION .</p>
     <p>Though it well may be reckoned , of all composition , the species at once most delightful and healthy , is a thing which an author , unless he be wealthy and willing to pay for that kind of delight , is not , in all instances , called on to write , though there are , it is said , who , their spirits to cheer , slip in a new title-page three times a year , and in this way snuff up an imaginary savor of that sweetest of dishes , the popular favor ,— much as if a starved painter should fall to and treat the Ugolino inside to a picture of meat .</p>
     <p>You remember ( if not , pray turn , backward and look ) that , in writing the preface which ushered my book , I treated you , excellent Public , not merely with a cool disregard , but downright cavalierly . Now I would not take back the least thing I then said , though I thereby could butter both sides of my bread , for I never could see that an author owed aught to the people he solaced , diverted , or taught ; and , as for mere fame , I have long ago learned that the persons by whom it is finally earned are those with whom your verdict weighed not a pin , unsustained by the higher court sitting within .</p>
     <p>But I wander from what I intended to say ,— that you have , namely , shown such a liberal way of thinking , and so much æsthetic perception of anonymous worth in the handsome reception you gave to my book , spite of some private piques ( having bought the first thousand in barely two weeks ) , that I think , past a doubt , if you measured the phiz of yours most devotedly , Wonderful Quiz , you would find that its vertical section was shorter , by an inch and two tenths , or ‘ twixt that and a quarter .</p>
     <p>You have watched a child playing — in those wondrous years when belief is not bound to the eyes and the ears , and the vision divine is so clear and unmarred , that each baker of pies in the dirt is a bard ? Give a knife and a shingle , he fits out a fleet , and , on that little mud-puddle over the street , his fancy , in purest good faith , will make sail round the globe with a puff of his breath for a gale , will visit , in barely ten minutes , all climes , and do the Columbus-feat hundreds of times . Or , suppose the young poet fresh stored with delights from that Bible of childhood , the Arabian Nights , he will turn to a crony and cry , ‘ Jack , let 's play that I am a Genius ! ’ Jacky straightway makes Aladdin 's lamp out of a stone , and , for hours , they enjoy each his own supernatural powers . This is all very pretty and pleasant , but then suppose our two urchins , have grown into men , and both have turned authors ,— one says to his brother , ‘ Let 's play we 're the American somethings or other ,— say Homer or Sophocles , Goethe or Scott ( only let them be big enough , no matter what ) . Come , you shall be Byron or Pope , which you choose : I 'll be Coleridge , and both shall write mutual reviews . ’ So they both ( as mere strangers ) before many days send each other a cord of anonymous bays . Each piling his epithets , smiles in his sleeve to see what his friend can be made to believe ; each , reading the other 's unbiased review , thinks — Here 's pretty high praise , but no more than my due . Well , we laugh at them both , and yet make no great fuss when the same farce is acted to benefit us . Even I , who , it asked , scarce a month since , what Fudge meant , should have answered , the dear Public 's critical judgment , begin to think sharp-witted Horace spoke sooth when he said that the Public sometimes hit the truth .</p>
     <p>In reading these lines , you perhaps have a vision of a person in pretty good health and condition ; and yet , since I put forth my primary edition , I have been crushed , scorched , withered , used up and put down ( by Smith with the cordial assistance of Brown ) , in all , if you put any faith in my rhymes , to the number of ninety-five several times , and , while I am writing ,— I tremble to think of it , for I may at this moment be just on the brink of it ,— Molybdostom , angry at being omitted , has begun a critique ,— am I not to be pitied ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></p>
     <p>Now I shall not crush them since , indeed , for that matter , no pressure I know of could render them flatter ; nor wither , nor scorch them ,— no action of fire could make either them or their articles drier ; nor waste time in putting them down — I am thinking not their own self-inflation will keep them from sinking ; for there 's this contradiction about the whole bevy ,— though without the least weight , they are awfully heavy . No , my dear honest bore , surdo fabulam narras , they are no more to me than a rat in the arras . I can walk with the Doctor , get facts from the Don , or draw out the Lambish quintessence of John , and feel nothing more than a half-comic sorrow , to think that they all will be lying to-morrow tossed carelessly up on the waste-paper shelves , and forgotten by all but their half-dozen selves . Once snug in my attic , my fire in a roar , I leave the whole pack of them outside the door . With Hakluyt or Purchas I wander away to the black northern seas or barbaric Cathay ; get fou with O'Shanter , and sober me then with that builder of brick-kilnish dramas , rare Ben ; snuff Herbert , as holy as a flower on a grave ; with Fletcher wax tender , o'er Chapman grow brave ; with Marlowe or Kyd take a fine poet-rave ; in Very , most Hebrew of Saxons , find peace ; with Lycidas welter on vext Irish seas ; with Webster grow wild , and climb earthward again , down by mystical Browne 's Jacob'shYpppHeNladderhYpppHeNlike brain , to that spiritual Pepys ( Cotton 's version ) Montaigne ; find a new depth in Wordsworth , undreamed of before , that marvel , a poet divine who can bore . Or , out of my study , the scholar thrown off , Nature holds up her shield ‘ gainst the sneer and the scoff ; the landscape , forever consoling and kind , pours her wine and her oil on the smarts of the mind . The waterfall , scattering its vanishing gems ; the tall grove of hemlocks , with moss on their stems , like plashes of sunlight ; the pond in the woods , where no foot but mine and the bittern 's intrudes , where pitcher-plants purple and gentians hard by recall to September the blue of June 's sky ; these are all my kind neighbors , and leave me no wish to say aught to you all , my poor critics , but — pish ! I 've buried the hatchet : I 'm twisting an allumette out of one of you now , and relighting my calumet . In your private capacities , come when you please , I will give you my hand and a fresh pipe apiece .</p>
     <p>As I ran through the leaves of my poor little book , to take a fond author 's first tremulous look , it was quite an excitement to hunt the errata , sprawled in as birds ’ tracks are in some kinds of strata ( only these made things crookeder ) . Fancy an heir that a father had seen born well-featured and fair , turning suddenly wry-nosed , club-footed , squint-eyed , hair-lipped , wapper-jawed , carrot-haired , from a pride become an aversion ,— my case was yet worse . A club-foot ( by way of a change ) in a verse , I might have forgiven , an o 's being wry , a limp in an e , or a cock in an i ,— but to have the sweet babe of my brain served in pi ! I am not queasy-stomached , but such a Thyestean banquet as that was quite out of the question .</p>
     <p>In the edition now issued no pains are neglected , and my verses , as orators say , stand corrected . Yet some blunders remain of the public 's own make , which I wish to correct for my personal sake . For instance , a character drawn in pure fun and condensing the traits of a dozen in one , has been , as I hear , by some persons applied to a good friend of mine , whom to stab in the side , as we walked along chatting and joking together , would not be my way . I can hardly tell whether a question will ever arise in which he and I should by any strange fortune agree , but meanwhile my esteem for him grows as I know him , and , though not the best judge on earth of a poem , he knows what it is he is saying and why , and is honest and fearless , two good points which I have not found so rife I can easily smother my love for them , whether on my side or t'other .</p>
     <p>For my other anonymi , you may be sure that I know what is meant by a caricature , and what by a portrait . There are those who think it is capital fun to be spattering their ink on quiet , unquarrelsome folk , but the minute the game changes sides and the others begin it , they see something savage and horrible in it . As for me I respect neither women nor men for their gender , nor own any sex in a pen . I choose just to hint to some causeless unfriends that , as far as I know , there are always two ends ( and one of them heaviest , too ) to a staff , and two parties also to every good laugh .</p>

       <l n="1">Phoebus , sitting one day in a laurel-tree 's shade ,</l>
       <l n="2">Was reminded of Daphne , of whom it was made ,</l>
       <l n="3">For the god being one day too warm in his wooing ,</l>
       <l n="4">She took to the tree to escape his pursuing ;</l>
       <l n="5">Be the cause what it might , from his offers she shrunk ,</l>
       <l n="6">And , Ginevra-like , shut herself up in a trunk ;</l>
       <l n="7">And , though ‘ twas a step into which he had driven her ,</l>
       <l n="8">He somehow or other had never forgiven her ;</l>
       <l n="9">Her memory he nursed as a kind of a tonic ,</l>
       <l n="10">Something bitter to chew when he 'd play the Byronic , 10</l>
       <l n="11">And I can n't count the obstinate nymphs that he brought over</l>
       <l n="12">By a strange kind of smile he put on when he thought of her .</l>
       <l n="13">‘ My case is like Dido 's , ’ he sometimes remarked ;</l>
       <l n="14">‘ When I last saw my love , she was fairly embarked</l>
       <l n="15">In a laurel , as she thought — but ( ah , how Fate mocks ! )</l>
       <l n="16">She has found it by this time a very bad box ;</l>
       <l n="17">Let hunters from me take this saw when they need it ,—</l>
       <l n="18">You 're not always sure of your game when you 've treed it .</l>
       <l n="19">Just conceive such a change taking place in one 's mistress !</l>
       <l n="20">What romance would be left ?— who can flatter or kiss trees ? 20</l>
       <l n="21">And , for mercy 's sake , how could one keep up a dialogue</l>
       <l n="22">With a dull wooden thing that will live and will die a log ,—</l>
       <l n="23">Not to say that the thought would forever intrude</l>
       <l n="24">That you 've less chance to win her the more she is wood ?</l>
       <l n="25">Ah ! it went to my heart , and the memory still grieves ,</l>
       <l n="26">To see those loved graces all taking their leaves ;</l>
       <l n="27">Those charms beyond speech , so enchanting but now ,</l>
       <l n="28">As they left me forever , each making its bough !</l>
       <l n="29">If her tongue had a tang sometimes more than was right ,</l>
       <l n="30">Her new bark is worse than ten times her old bite . ’ 30</l>

       <l n="31">Now , Daphne — before she was happily treeified —</l>
       <l n="32">Over all other blossoms the lily had deified ,</l>
       <l n="33">And when she expected the god on a visit</l>
       <l n="34">( ‘ Twas before he had made his intentions explicit ) ,</l>
       <l n="35">Some buds she arranged with a vast deal of care ,</l>
       <l n="36">To look as if artlessly twined in her hair ,</l>
       <l n="37">Where they seemed , as he said , when he paid his addresses ,</l>
       <l n="38">Like the day breaking through , the long night of her tresses ;</l>
       <l n="39">So whenever he wished to be quite irresistible ,</l>
       <l n="40">Like a man with eight trumps in his hand at a whist-table 40</l>
       <l n="41">( I feared me at first that the rhyme was untwistable ,</l>
       <l n="42">Though I might have lugged in an allusion to Cristabel ) ,—</l>
       <l n="43">He would take up a lily , and gloomily look in it ,</l>
       <l n="44">As I shall at the ——, when they cut up my book in it .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="45">Well , here , after all the bad rhyme I 've been spinning ,</l>
       <l n="46">I 've got back at last to my story 's beginning :</l>
       <l n="47">Sitting there , as I say , in the shade of his mistress ,</l>
       <l n="48">As dull as a volume of old Chester mysteries ,</l>
       <l n="49">Or as those puzzling specimens which , in old histories ,</l>
       <l n="50">We read of his verses — the Oracles , namely ,— 50</l>
       <l n="51">( I wonder the Greeks should have swallowed them tamely ,</l>
       <l n="52">For one might bet safely whatever he has to risk ,</l>
       <l n="53">They were laid at his door by some ancient Miss Asterisk ,</l>
       <l n="54">And so dull that the men who retailed them out-doors</l>
       <l n="55">Got the ill name of augurs , because they were bores ,—)</l>
       <l n="56">First , he mused what the animal substance or herb is</l>
       <l n="57">Would induce a mustache , for you know he 's imberbis ;</l>
       <l n="58">Then he shuddered to think how his youthful position</l>
       <l n="59">Was assailed by the age of his son the physician ;</l>
       <l n="60">At some poems he glanced , had been sent to him lately , 60</l>
       <l n="61">And the metre and sentiment puzzled him greatly ;</l>
       <l n="62">‘ Mehercle ! I 'd make such proceeding felonious ,—</l>
       <l n="63">Have they all of them slept in the cave of Trophonius ?</l>
       <l n="64">Look well to your seat , ‘ tis like taking an airing</l>
       <l n="65">On a corduroy road , and that out of repairing ;</l>
       <l n="66">It leads one , ‘ tis true , through the primitive forest ,</l>
       <l n="67">Grand natural features , but then one has no rest ;</l>
       <l n="68">You just catch a glimpse of some ravishing distance ,</l>
       <l n="69">When a jolt puts the whole of it out of existence ,—</l>
       <l n="70">Why not use their ears , if they happen to have any ? ’ 70</l>
       <l n="71">— Here the laurel leaves murmured the name of poor Daphne .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="72">‘ Oh , weep with me , Daphne , ’ he sighed , ‘ for you know it 's</l>
       <l n="73">A terrible thing to be pestered with poets !</l>
       <l n="74">But , alas , she is dumb , and the proverb holds good ,</l>
       <l n="75">She never will cry till she 's out of the wood !</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">My worthy friend , A. Gordon Knott ,</l>
       <l n="2">From business snug withdrawn ,</l>
       <l n="3">Was much contented with a lot</l>
       <l n="4">That would contain a Tudor cot</l>
       <l n="5">‘ Twixt twelve feet square of garden-plot ,</l>
       <l n="6">And twelve feet more of lawn .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">He had laid business on the shelf</l>
       <l n="8">To give his taste expansion ,</l>
       <l n="9">And , since no man , retired with pelf ,</l>
       <l n="10">The building mania can shun , 10</l>
       <l n="11">Knott , being middle-aged himself ,</l>
       <l n="12">Resolved to build ( unhappy elf ! )</l>
       <l n="13">A mediæval mansion .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="14">He called an architect in counsel ;</l>
       <l n="15">‘ I want , ’ said he , ‘ a — you know what ,</l>
       <l n="16">( You are a builder , I am Knott )</l>
       <l n="17">A thing complete from chimney-pot</l>
       <l n="18">Down to the very grounsel ;</l>
       <l n="19">Here 's a half-acre of good land ;</l>
       <l n="20">Just have it nicely mapped and planned 20</l>
       <l n="21">And make your workmen drive on ;</l>
       <l n="22">Meadow there is , and upland too ,</l>
       <l n="23">And I should like a water-view ,</l>
       <l n="24">D'you think you could contrive one ?</l>
       <l n="25">( Perhaps the pump and trough would do ,</l>
       <l n="26">If painted a judicious blue ? )</l>
       <l n="27">The woodland I 've attended to ; ’</l>
       <l n="28">[ He meant three pines stuck up askew ,</l>
       <l n="29">Two dead ones and a live one . ]</l>
       <l n="30">‘ A pocket-full of rocks ‘ twould take 30</l>
       <l n="31">To build a house of freestone ,</l>
       <l n="32">But then it is not hard to make</l>
       <l n="33">What nowadays is the stone ;</l>
       <l n="34">The cunning painter in a trice</l>
       <l n="35">Your house 's outside petrifies ,</l>
       <l n="36">And people think it very gneiss</l>
       <l n="37">Without inquiring deeper ;</l>
       <l n="38">My money never shall be thrown</l>
       <l n="39">Away on such a deal of stone ,</l>
       <l n="40">When stone of deal is cheaper . ’ 40</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="41">And so the greenest of antiques</l>
       <l n="42">Was reared for Knott to dwell in :</l>
       <l n="43">The architect worked hard for weeks</l>
       <l n="44">In venting all his private peaks</l>
       <l n="45">Upon the roof , whose crop of leaks</l>
       <l n="46">Had satisfied Fluellen ;</l>
       <l n="47">Whatever anybody had</l>
       <l n="48">Out of the common , good or bad ,</l>
       <l n="49">Knott had it all worked well in ;</l>
       <l n="50">A donjon-keep , where clothes might dry , 50</l>
       <l n="51">A porter 's lodge that was a sty ,</l>
       <l n="52">A campanile slim and high ,</l>
       <l n="53">Too small to hang a bell in ;</l>
       <l n="54">All up and down and here and there ,</l>
       <l n="55">With Lord-knows-whats of round and square</l>
       <l n="56">Stuck on at random everywhere ,—</l>
       <l n="57">It was a house to make one stare ,</l>
       <l n="58">All corners and all gables ;</l>
       <l n="59">Like dogs let loose upon a bear ,</l>
       <l n="60">Ten emulous styles staboyed with care , 60</l>
       <l n="61">The whole among them seemed to tear ,</l>
       <l n="62">And all the oddities to spare</l>
       <l n="63">Were set upon the stables .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="64">Knott was delighted with a pile</l>
       <l n="65">Approved by fashion 's leaders :</l>
       <l n="66">( Only he made the builder smile ,</l>
       <l n="67">By asking every little while ,</l>
       <l n="68">Why that was called the Twodoor style ,</l>
       <l n="69">Which certainly had three doors ? )</l>
       <l n="70">Yet better for this luckless man 70</l>
       <l n="71">If he had put a downright ban</l>
       <l n="72">Upon the thing in limine ;</l>
       <l n="73">For , though to quit affairs his plan ,</l>
       <l n="74">Ere many days , poor Knott began</l>
       <l n="75">Perforce accepting draughts , that ran</l>
       <l n="76">All ways — except up chimney ;</l>
       <l n="77">The house , though painted stone to mock ,</l>
       <l n="78">With nice white lines round every block ,</l>
       <l n="79">Some trepidation stood in ,</l>
       <l n="80">When tempests ( with petrific shock , 80</l>
       <l n="81">So to speak ,) made it really rock ,</l>
       <l n="82">Though not a whit less wooden ;</l>
       <l n="83">And painted stone , howe'er well done ,</l>
       <l n="84">Will not take in the prodigal sun</l>
       <l n="85">Whose beams are never quite at one</l>
       <l n="86">With our terrestrial lumber ;</l>
       <l n="87">So the wood shrank around the knots ,</l>
       <l n="88">And gaped in disconcerting spots ,</l>
       <l n="89">And there were lots of dots and rots</l>
       <l n="90">And crannies without number , 90</l>
       <l n="91">Wherethrough , as you may well presume ,</l>
       <l n="92">The wind , like water through a flume ,</l>
       <l n="93">Came rushing in ecstatic ,</l>
       <l n="94">Leaving , in all three floors , no room</l>
       <l n="95">That was not a rheumatic ;</l>
       <l n="96">And , what with points and squares and rounds</l>
       <l n="97">Grown shaky on their poises ,</l>
       <l n="98">The house at nights was full of pounds ,</l>
       <l n="99">Thumps , bumps , creaks , scratchings , raps — till — ‘ Zounds ! ’</l>
       <l n="100">Cried Knott , ‘ this goes beyond all bounds ; 100</l>
       <l n="101">I do not deal in tongues and sounds ,</l>
       <l n="102">Nor have I let my house and grounds</l>
       <l n="103">To a family of Noyeses ! ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="104">But , though Knott 's house was full of airs ,</l>
       <l n="105">He had but one ,— a daughter ;</l>
       <l n="106">And , as he owned much stocks and shares ,</l>
       <l n="107">Many who wished to render theirs</l>
       <l n="108">Such vain , unsatisfying cares ,</l>
       <l n="109">And needed wives to sew their tears ,</l>
       <l n="110">In matrimony sought her ; 110</l>
       <l n="111">They vowed her gold they wanted not ,</l>
       <l n="112">Their faith would never falter ,</l>
       <l n="113">They longed to tie this single Knott</l>
       <l n="114">In the Hymeneal halter ;</l>
       <l n="115">So daily at the door they rang ,</l>
       <l n="116">Cards for the belle delivering ,</l>
       <l n="117">Or in the choir at her they sang ,</l>
       <l n="118">Achieving such a rapturous twang</l>
       <l n="119">As set her nerves ashivering .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="120">Now Knott had quite made up his mind 120</l>
       <l n="121">That Colonel Jones should have her ;</l>
       <l n="122">No beauty he , but oft we find</l>
       <l n="123">Sweet kernels ‘ neath a roughish rind ,</l>
       <l n="124">So hoped his Jenny 'd be resigned</l>
       <l n="125">And make no more palaver ;</l>
       <l n="126">Glanced at the fact that love was blind ,</l>
       <l n="127">That girls were ratherish inclined</l>
       <l n="128">To pet their little crosses ,</l>
       <l n="129">Then nosologically defined</l>
       <l n="130">The rate at which the system pined 130</l>
       <l n="131">In those unfortunates who dined</l>
       <l n="132">Upon that metaphoric kind</l>
       <l n="133">Of dish — their own proboscis .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="134">But she , with many tears and moans ,</l>
       <l n="135">Besought him not to mock her .</l>
       <l n="136">Said ‘ twas too much for flesh and bones</l>
       <l n="137">To marry mortgages and loans ,</l>
       <l n="138">That fathers ’ hearts were stocks and stones .</l>
       <l n="139">And that she 'd go , when Mrs. Jones ,</l>
       <l n="140">To Davy Jones 's locker ; 140</l>
       <l n="141">Then gave her head a little toss</l>
       <l n="142">That said as plain as ever was ,</l>
       <l n="143">If men are always at a loss</l>
       <l n="144">Mere womankind to bridle —</l>
       <l n="145">To try the thing on woman cross</l>
       <l n="146">Were fifty times as idle ;</l>
       <l n="147">For she a strict resolve had made</l>
       <l n="148">And registered in private ,</l>
       <l n="149">That either she would die a maid ,</l>
       <l n="150">Or else be Mrs . Doctor Slade , 150</l>
       <l n="151">If a woman could contrive it ;</l>
       <l n="152">And , though the wedding-day was set ,</l>
       <l n="153">Jenny was more so , rather ,</l>
       <l n="154">Declaring , in a pretty pet ,</l>
       <l n="155">That , howsoe'er they spread their net ,</l>
       <l n="156">She would out-Jennyral them yet ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="158">Just at this time the Public 's eyes</l>
       <l n="159">Were keenly on the watch , a stir</l>
       <l n="160">Beginning slowly to arise 160</l>
       <l n="161">About those questions and replies .</l>
       <l n="162">Those raps that unwrapped mysteries</l>

       <l n="1">At first the ghosts were somewhat shy ,</l>
       <l n="2">Coming when none but Knott was nigh ,</l>
       <l n="3">And people said ‘ twas all their eye ,</l>
       <l n="4">( Or rather his ) a flam , the sly</l>
       <l n="5">Digestion 's machination :</l>
       <l n="6">Some recommended a wet sheet ,</l>
       <l n="7">Some a nice broth of pounded peat ,</l>
       <l n="8">Some a cold flat-iron to the feet ,</l>
       <l n="9">Some a decoction of lamb'shYpppHeNbleat ,</l>
       <l n="10">Some a southwesterly grain of wheat ; 310</l>
       <l n="11">Meat was by some pronounced unmeet ,</l>
       <l n="12">Others thought fish most indiscreet ,</l>
       <l n="13">And that ‘ twas worse than all to eat</l>
       <l n="14">Of vegetables , sour or sweet ,</l>
       <l n="15">( Except , perhaps , the skin of beet ,)</l>
       <l n="16">In such a concatenation :</l>
       <l n="17">One quack his button gently plucks</l>
       <l n="18">And murmurs , ‘ Biliary ducks ! ’</l>
       <l n="19">Says Knott , ‘ I never ate one ; ’</l>
       <l n="20">But all , though brimming full of wrath , 320</l>
       <l n="21">Homoeo , Allo , Hydropath ,</l>
       <l n="22">Concurred in this — that t'other ' s path</l>
       <l n="23">To death 's door was the straight one .</l>
       <l n="24">Still , spite of medical advice ,</l>
       <l n="25">The ghosts came thicker , and a spice</l>
       <l n="26">Of mischief grew apparent ;</l>
       <l n="27">Nor did they only come at night ,</l>
       <l n="28">But seemed to fancy broad daylight ,</l>
       <l n="29">Till Knott , in horror and affright ,</l>
       <l n="30">His unoffending hair rent ; 330</l>
       <l n="31">Whene'er with handkerchief on lap ,</l>
       <l n="32">He made his elbow-chair a trap ,</l>
       <l n="33">To catch an after-dinner nap ,</l>
       <l n="34">The spirits , always on the tap ,</l>
       <l n="35">Would make a sudden rap , rap , rap ,</l>
       <l n="36">The half-spun cord of sleep to snap ,</l>
       <l n="37">( And what is life without its nap</l>
       <l n="38">But threadbareness and mere mishap ? ) 338</l>
       <l n="39">As ‘ twere with a percussion cap</l>
       <l n="40">The trouble 's climax capping ;</l>
       <l n="41">It seemed a party dried and grim</l>
       <l n="42">Of mummies had come to visit him ,</l>
       <l n="43">Each getting off from every limb</l>
       <l n="44">Its multitudinous wrapping ;</l>
       <l n="45">Scratchings sometimes the walls ran round ,</l>
       <l n="46">The merest penny-weights of sound ;</l>
       <l n="47">Sometimes ‘ twas only by the pound</l>
       <l n="48">They carried on their dealing ,</l>
       <l n="49">A thumping ‘ neath the parlor floor ,</l>
       <l n="50">Thump-bump-thump-bumping o'er and o'er , 350</l>
       <l n="51">As if the vegetables in store</l>
       <l n="52">( Quiet and orderly before )</l>
       <l n="53">Were all together peeling ;</l>
       <l n="54">You would have thought the thing was done</l>
       <l n="55">By the spirit of some son of a gun ,</l>
       <l n="56">And that a forty-two-pounder ,</l>
       <l n="57">Or that the ghost which made such sounds</l>
       <l n="58">Could be none other than John Pounds ,</l>
       <l n="59">Of Ragged Schools the founder .</l>
       <l n="60">Through three gradations of affright , 360</l>
       <l n="61">The awful noises reached their height ;</l>
       <l n="62">At first they knocked nocturnally ,</l>
       <l n="63">Then , for some reason , changing quite ,</l>
       <l n="64">( As mourners , after six months ’ flight ,</l>
       <l n="65">Turn suddenly from dark to light ,)</l>
       <l n="66">Began to knock diurnally ,</l>
       <l n="67">And last , combining all their stocks ,</l>
       <l n="68">( Scotland was ne'er so full of Knox ,)</l>
       <l n="69">Into one Chaos ( father of Nox ,)</l>
       <l n="70">Nocte pluit — they showered knocks , 370</l>
       <l n="71">And knocked , knocked , knocked , eternally ;</l>
       <l n="72">Ever upon the go , like buoys ,</l>
       <l n="73">( Wooden sea-urchins ,) all Knott 's joys ,</l>
       <l n="74">They turned to troubles and a noise</l>

       <l n="79">And fly back ( curbless as a trope</l>

       <l n="15">I would not hint at this so soon , but in our callous day ,</l>
       <l n="16">The Tollman Debt , who drops his bar across the world 's highway ,</l>
       <l n="17">Great Cæsar in mid-march would stop , if Cæsar could not pay ;</l>
       <l n="18">Pilgriming 's dearer than it was : men cannot travel now</l>
       <l n="19">Scot-free from Dan to Beersheba upon a simple vow ;</l>
       <l n="20">Nay , as long back as Bess 's time ,— when Walsingham went over</l>
       <l n="21">Ambassador to Cousin France , at Canterbury and Dover 20</l>
       <l n="22">He was so fleeced by innkeepers that , ere he quitted land ,</l>
       <l n="23">He wrote to the Prime Minister to take the knaves in hand .</l>
       <l n="24">If I with staff and scallop-shell should try my way to win ,</l>
       <l n="25">Would Bonifaces quarrel as to who should take me in ?</l>
       <l n="26">Or would my pilgrim 's progress end where Bunyan started his on ,</l>
       <l n="27">And my grand tour be round and round the backyard of a prison ?</l>
       <l n="28">I give you here a saying deep and therefore , haply true ;</l>
       <l n="29">‘ Tis out of Merlin 's prophecies , but quite as good as new :</l>
       <l n="30">The question boath for men and meates longe voyages yt beginne</l>
       <l n="31">Lyes in a notshell , rather saye lyes in a case of tinne . 20</l>

       <l n="33">With self-sustaining retinues of little gilt-edged pages ,</l>
       <l n="34">Yet one may manage pleasantly , where'er he likes to roam ,</l>
       <l n="35">By sending his small pages ( at so much per small page ) home ;</l>
       <l n="36">And if a staff and scallop-shell wo n't serve so well as then ,</l>
       <l n="37">Our outlay is about as small — just paper , ink , and pen .</l>
       <l n="38">Be thankful ! Humbugs never die , more than the wandering Jew ;</l>
       <l n="39">Bankrupt , they publish their own deaths , slink for a while from view ,</l>
       <l n="40">Then take an alias , change the sign , and the old trade renew ;</l>
       <l n="41">Indeed , ‘ tis wondrous how each Age , though laughing at the Past , 40</l>
       <l n="42">Insists on having its tight shoe made on the same old last ;</l>
       <l n="43">How it is sure its system would break up at once without</l>
       <l n="44">The bunion which it will believe hereditary gout ;</l>
       <l n="45">How it takes all its swans for geese , nay , stranger yet and sadder ,</l>
       <l n="46">Sees in its treadmill 's fruitless jog a heavenward Jacob'shYpppHeNladder ,</l>
       <l n="47">Shouts , Lo , the Shining Heights are reached ! One moment , more aspire !</l>
       <l n="48">Trots into cramps its poor , dear legs , gets never an inch the higher ,</l>
       <l n="49">And like the others , ends with pipe and mug beside the fire .</l>
       <l n="50">There , ‘ tween each doze , it whiffs and sips and watches with a sneer</l>
       <l n="51">The green recruits that trudge and sweat where it had swinked</l>
       <l n="52">whilere , 50</l>
       <l n="53">And sighs to think this soon spent zeal should be in simple truth ,</l>
       <l n="54">The only interval between old Fogyhood and Youth :</l>
       <l n="55">‘ Well , ’ thus it muses , ‘ well , what odds ? ‘ Tis not for us to warn ;</l>
       <l n="56">‘ Twill be the same when we are dead , and was ere we were born ;</l>
       <l n="57">Without the Treadmill , too , how grind our store of winter 's corn ?</l>
       <l n="58">Had we no stock , nor twelve per cent received from Treadmill shares ,</l>
       <l n="59">We might ... but these poor devils at last will get our easy chairs .</l>
       <l n="60">High aims and hopes have great rewards , they , too , serene and snug ,</l>
       <l n="61">Shall one day have their soothing pipe and their enlivening mug ;</l>
       <l n="62">From Adam , empty-handed Youth hath always heard the hum 60</l>
       <l n="63">Of Good Times Coming , and will hear until the last day come ;</l>
       <l n="64">Young ears Hear forward , old ones back , and , while the earth rolls on ,</l>
       <l n="65">Full-handed Eld shall hear recede the steps of Good Times Gone ;</l>
       <l n="66">Ah what a cackle we set up whene'er an egg was laid !</l>
       <l n="67">Cack-cack-cack-cackle ! rang around , the scratch for worms was stayed ,</l>
       <l n="68">Cut-cut-ca-dah-cut ! from this egg the coming cock shall stalk !</l>
       <l n="69">The great New Era dawns , the age of Deeds and not of Talk !</l>
       <l n="70">And every stupid hen of us hugged close his egg of chalk ,</l>
       <l n="71">Thought ,— sure , I feel life stir within , each day with greater strength ,</l>
       <l n="72">When lo , the chick ! from former chicks he differed not a jot , 70</l>
       <l n="73">But grew and crew and scratched and went , like those before , to pot ! ’</l>
       <l n="74">So muse the dim Emeriti , and , mournful though it be ,</l>
       <l n="75">I must confess a kindred thought hath sometimes come to me ,</l>
       <l n="76">Who , though but just of forty turned , have heard the rumorous fame</l>
       <l n="77">Of nine and ninety Coming Men , all — coming till they came .</l>
       <l n="78">Pure Mephistopheles all this ? the vulgar nature jeers ?</l>
       <l n="79">Good friend , while I was writing it , my eyes were dim with tears ;</l>
       <l n="80">Thrice happy he who cannot see , or who his eyes can shut ,</l>
       <l n="81">Life 's deepest sorrow is contained in that small word there — But !</l>

       <l n="85">And questioning Deeps that never yet have oped their lips to mortal ;</l>
       <l n="86">We 're growing pale and hollow-eyed , and out of all condition ,</l>

       <l n="98">Small gulf between the ape and man ; you bridge it with your staff ;</l>

       <l n="116">There are some goodish things at sea ; for instance , one can feel</l>
       <l n="117">A grandeur in the silent man forever at the wheel ,</l>
       <l n="118">That bit of two-legged intellect , that particle of drill ,</l>
       <l n="119">Who the huge floundering hulk inspires with reason , brain , and will ,</l>
       <l n="120">And makes the ship , though skies are black and headwinds whistle loud ,</l>
       <l n="121">Obey her conscience there which feels the loadstar through the cloud ;</l>
       <l n="122">And when by lusty western gales the full-sailed barque is hurled ,</l>
       <l n="123">Towards the great moon which , setting on , the silent underworld , 120</l>
       <l n="124">Rounds luridly up to look on ours , and shoots a broadening line ,</l>
       <l n="125">Of palpitant light from crest to crest across the ridgy brine ,</l>
       <l n="126">Then from the bows look back and feel a thrill that never stales ,</l>

       <l n="150">Each nation has its path marked out , from which it must not budge ;</l>
       <l n="151">The Romans had as little art as Noah in his ark ,</l>
       <l n="152">Yet somehow on this globe contrived to make an epic mark ; 149</l>
       <l n="153">Religion , painting , sculpture , song — for these they ran up jolly ticks</l>
       <l n="154">With Greece and Egypt , but they were great artists in their politics ,</l>
       <l n="155">And if we make no minsters , John , nor epics , yet the Fates</l>
       <l n="156">Are not entirely deaf to men who can build ships and states ;</l>
       <l n="157">The arts are never pioneers , but men have strength and health</l>
       <l n="158">Who , called on suddenly , can improvise a commonwealth ,</l>
       <l n="159">Nay , can more easily go on and frame them by the dozen ,</l>

       <l n="163">This is the Age of Scramble ; men move faster than they did 160</l>
       <l n="164">When they pried up the imperial Past 's deep-dusted coffin-lid ,</l>
       <l n="165">Searching for scrolls of precedent ; the wire-leashed lightning now</l>
       <l n="166">Replaces Delphos — men do n't leave the steamer for the scow ;</l>

      <head>THE BIGLOW PAPERS</head>
      <head>FIRST SERIES</head>
      <head>NOTICES OF AN INDEPENDENT PRESS</head>
      <note>I have observed , reader ( bene-or male-volent , as it may happen ) , that it is customary to append to the second editions of books , and to the second works of authors , short sentences commendatory of the first , under the title of Notices of the Press . These , I have been given to understand , are procurable at certain established rates , payment being made either in money or advertising patronage by the publisher , or by an adequate outlay of servility on the part of the author . Considering these things with myself , and also that such notices are neither intended , nor generally believed , to convey any real opinions , being a purely ceremonial accompaniment of literature , and resembling certificates to the virtues of various morbiferal panaceas , I conceived that it would be not only more economical to prepare a sufficient number of such myself , but also more immediately subservient to the end in view to prefix them to this our primary edition rather than to await the contingency of a second , when they would seem to be of small utility . To delay attaching the bobs until the second attempt at flying the kite would indicate but a slender experience in that useful art . Neither has it escaped my notice nor failed to afford me matter of reflection , that , when a circus or a caravan is about to visit Jaalam , the initial step is to send forward large and highly ornamented bills of performance , to be hung in the bar-room and the post-office . These having been sufficiently gazed at , and beginning to lose their attractiveness except for the flies , and , truly , the boys also ( in whom I find it impossible to repress , even during school-hours , certain oral and telegraphic communications concerning the expected show ) , upon some fine morning the band enters in a gayly painted wagon , or triumphal chariot , and with noisy advertisement , by means of brass , wood , and sheepskin , makes the circuit of our startled village streets . Then , as the exciting sounds draw nearer and nearer , do I desiderate those eyes of Aristarchus , ‘ whose looks were as a breeching to a boy . ’ Then do I perceive , with vain regret of wasted opportunities , the advantage of a pancratic or pantechnic education , since he is most reverenced by my little subjects who can throw the cleanest summerset or walk most securely upon the revolving cask . The story of the Pied Piper becomes for the first time credible to me ( albeit confirmed by the Hameliners dating their legal instruments from the period of his exit ) , as I behold how those strains , without pretence of magical potency , bewitch the pupillary legs , nor leave to the pedagogic an entire self-control . For these reasons , lest my kingly prerogative should suffer diminution , I prorogue my restless commons , whom I follow into the street , chiefly lest some mischief may chance befall them . After the manner of such a band , I send forward the following notices of domestic manufacture , to make brazen proclamation , not unconscious of the advantage which will accrue , if our little craft , cymbula sutilis , shall seem to leave port with a clipping breeze , and to carry , in nautical phrase , a bone in her mouth . Nevertheless , I have chosen , as being more equitable , to prepare some also sufficiently objurgatory , that readers of every taste may find a dish to their palate . I have modelled them upon actually existing specimens , preserved in my own cabinet of natural curiosities . One , in particular , I had copied with tolerable exactness from a notice of one of my own discourses , which , from its superior tone and appearance of vast experience , I concluded to have been written by a man at least three hundred years of age , though I recollected no existing instance of such antediluvian longevity . Nevertheless , I afterwards discovered the author to be a young gentleman preparing for the ministry under the direction of one of my brethren in a neighboring town , and whom I had once instinctively corrected in a Latin quantity . But this I have been forced to omit , from its too great length .— H. W .</note>
       <l n="1">From the Universal Littery Universe .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Full of passages which rivet the attention of the reader .... Under a rustic garb , sentiments are conveyed which should be committed to the memory and engraven on the heart of every moral and social being .... We consider this a unique performance .... We hope to see it soon introduced into our common schools .... Mr. Wilbur has performed his duties as editor with excellent taste and judgment .... This is a vein which we hope to see successfully prosecuted .... We hail the appearance of this work as a long stride toward the formation of a purely aboriginal , indigenous , native , and American literature . We rejoice to meet with an author national enough to break away from the slavish deference , too common among us , to English grammar and orthography .... Where all is so good , we are at a loss how to make extracts .... On the whole , we may call it a volume which no library , pretending to entire completeness , should fail to place upon its shelves .</p>
     <p>From the Higginbottomopolis Snapping-turtle .</p>
     <p>A collection of the merest balderdash and doggerel that it was ever our bad fortune to lay eyes on . The author is a vulgar buffoon , and the editor a talkative , tedious old fool . We use strong language , but should any of our readers peruse the book , ( from which calamity Heaven preserve them ! ) they will find reasons for it thick as the leaves of Vallum-brozer , or , to use a still more expressive comparison , as the combined heads of author and editor . The work is wretchedly got up .... We should like to know how much British gold was pocketed by this libeller of our country and her purest patriots .</p>
     <p>From the Oldfogrumville Mentor .</p>
     <p>We have not had time to do more than glance through this handsomely printed volume , but the name of its respectable editor , the Rev . Mr. Wilbur , of Jaalam , will afford a sufficient guaranty for the worth of its contents .... The paper is white , the type clear , and the volume of a convenient and attractive size .... In reading this elegantly executed work , it has seemed to us that a passage or two might have been retrenched with advantage , and that the general style of diction was susceptible of a higher polish .... On the whole , we may safely leave the ungrateful task of criticism to the reader . We will barely suggest , that in volumes intended , as this is , for the illustration of a provincial dialect and turns of expression , a dash of humor or satire might be thrown in with advantage .... The work is admirably got up .... This work will form an appropriate ornament to the centre table . It is beautifully printed , on paper of an excellent quality .</p>
     <p>From the Dekay Bulwark .</p>
     <p>We should be wanting in our duty as the conductor of that tremendous engine , a public press , as an American , and as a man , did we allow such an opportunity as is presented to us by ‘ The Biglow Papers ’ to pass by without entering our earnest protest against such attempts ( now , alas ! too common ) at demoralizing the public sentiment . Under a wretched mask of stupid drollery , slavery , war , the social glass , and , in short , all the valuable and time-honored institutions justly dear to our common humanity and especially to republicans , are made the butt of coarse and senseless ribaldry by this low-minded scribbler . It is time that the respectable and religious portion of our community should be aroused to the alarming inroads of foreign Jacobinism , sansculottism , and infidelity . It is a fearful proof of the widespread nature of this contagion , that these secret stabs at religion and virtue are given from under the cloak ( credite , posteri ! ) of a clergyman . It is a mournful spectacle indeed to the patriot and Christian to see liberality and new ideas ( falsely so called ,— they are as old as Eden ) invading the sacred precincts of the pulpit .... On the whole , we consider this volume as one of the first shocking results which we predicted would spring out of the late French ‘ Revolution ’ (! )</p>
     <p>From the Bungtown Copper and Comprehensive Tocsin ( a try-weakly family journal ) .</p>
     <p>Altogether an admirable work .... Full of humor , boisterous , but delicate ,— of wit withering and scorching , yet combined with a pathos cool as morning dew ,— of satire ponderous as the mace of Richard , yet keen as the scymitar of Saladin .... A work full of ‘ mountain-mirth , ’ mischievous as Puck , and lightsome as Ariel .... We know not whether to admire most the genial , fresh , and discursive concinnity of the author , or his playful fancy , weird imagination , and compass of style , at once both objective and subjective .... We might indulge in some criticisms , but , were the author other than he is , he would be a different being . As it is , he has a wonderful pose , which flits from flower to flower , and bears the reader irresistibly along on its eagle pinions ( like Ganymede ) to the ‘ highest heaven of invention . ’ ... We love a book so purely objective ... Many of his pictures of natural scenery have an extraordinary subjective clearness and fidelity .... In fine , we consider this as one of the most extraordinary volumes of this or any age . We know of no English author who could have written it . It is a work to which the proud genius of our country , standing with one foot on the Aroostook and the other on the Rio Grande , and holding up the star-spangled banner amid the wreck of matter and the crush of worlds , may point with bewildering scorn of the punier efforts of enslaved Europe .... We hope soon to encounter our author among those higher walks of literature in which he is evidently capable of achieving enduring fame . Already we should be inclined to assign him a high position in the bright galaxy of our American bards .</p>
     <p>From the Saltriver Pilot and Flag of Freedom .</p>
     <p>A volume in bad grammar and worse taste .... While the pieces here collected were confined to their appropriate sphere in the corners of obscure newspapers , we considered them wholly beneath contempt , but , as the author has chosen to come forward in this public manner , he must expect the lash he so richly merits .... Contemptible slanders .... Vilest Billingsgate .... Has raked all the gutters of our language .... The most pure , upright , and consistent politicians not safe from his malignant venom .... General Cushing comes in for a share of his vile calumnies .... The Reverend Homer Wilbur is a disgrace to his cloth ....</p>
     <p>From the World-Harmonic-Æolian-Attachment .</p>
     <p>Speech is silver : silence is golden . No utterance more Orphic than this . While , therefore , as highest author , we reverence him whose works continue heroically unwritten , we have also our hopeful word for those who with pen ( from wing of goose loud-cackling , or seraph God-commissioned ) record the thing that is revealed .... Under mask of quaintest irony , we detect here the deep , storm-tost ( nigh ship-wracked ) soul , thunder-scarred , semi-articulate , but ever climbing hopefully toward the peaceful summits of an Infinite Sorrow .... Yes , thou poor , forlorn Hosea , with Hebrew fire-flaming soul in thee , for thee also this life of ours has not been without its aspects of heavenliest pity and laughingest mirth . Conceivable enough ! Through coarse Thersites-cloak , we have revelation of the heart , wild-glowing , world-clasping , that is in him . Bravely he grapples with the life-problem as it presents itself to him , uncombed , shaggy , careless of the ‘ nicer proprieties , ’ inexpert of ‘ elegant diction , ’ yet with voice audible enough to whoso hath ears , up there on the gravelly side-hills , or down on the splashy , indiarubber-like salt-marshes of native Jaalam . To this soul also the Necessity of Creating somewhat has unveiled its awful front . If not Oedipuses and Electras and Alcestises , then in God 's name Birdofredum Sawins ! These also shall get born into the world , and filch ( if so need ) a Zingali subsistence therein , these lank , omnivorous Yankees of his . He shall paint the Seen , since the Unseen will not sit to him . Yet in him also are Nibelungen-lays , and Iliads , and Ulysses-wanderings , and Divine Comedies ,— if only once he could come at them ! Therein lies much , nay all ; for what truly is this which we name All , but that which we do not possess ?... Glimpses also are given us of an old father Ezekiel , not without paternal pride , as is the wont of such . A brown , parchment-hided old man of the geoponic or bucolic species , gray-eyed , we fancy , queued perhaps , with much weather-cunning and plentiful September-gale memories , bidding fair in good time to become the Oldest Inhabitant . After such hasty apparition , he vanishes and is seen no more .... Of ‘ Rev . Homer Wilbur , A. M ., Pastor of the First Church in Jaalam , ’ we have small care to speak here . Spare touch in him of his Melesigenes namesake , save , haply , the — blindness ! A tolerably caliginose , nephelegeretous elderly gentleman , with infinite faculty of sermonizing , muscularized by long practice and excellent digestive apparatus , and , for the rest , well-meaning enough , and with small private illuminations ( somewhat tallowy , it is to be feared ) of his own . To him , there , ‘ Pastor of the First Church in Jaalam , ’ our Hosea presents himself as a quite inexplicable Sphinx-riddle . A rich poverty of Latin and Greek ,— so far is clear enough , even to eyes peering myopic through horn-lensed editorial spectacles ,— but naught farther ? O purblind , well-meaning , altogether fuscous Melesigenes-Wilbur , there are things in him incommunicable by stroke of birch ! Did it ever enter that old bewildered head of thine that there was the Possibility of the Infinite in him ? To thee , quite wingless ( and even featherless ) biped , has not so much even as a dream of wings ever come ? ‘ Talented young parishioner ’ ? Among the Arts whereof thou art Magister , does that of seeing happen to be one ? Unhappy Artium Magister ! Somehow a Nemean lion , fulvous , torrid-eyed , dry-nursed in broad-howling sand-wildernesses of a sufficiently rare spirit-Libya ( it may be supposed ) has got whelped among the sheep . Already he stands wild-glaring , with feet clutching the ground as with oak-roots , gathering for a Remus-spring over the walls of thy little fold . In heaven 's name , go not near him with that flybite crook of thine ! In good time , thou painful preacher , thou wilt go to the appointed place of departed Artillery-Election Sermons , Right-hands of Fellowship , and Results of Councils , gathered to thy spiritual fathers with much Latin of the Epitaphial sort ; thou too , shalt have thy reward ; but on him the Eumenides have looked , not Xantippes of the pit , snake-tressed , finger-threatening , but radiantly calm as on antique gems ; for him paws impatient the winged courser of the gods , champing unwelcome bit ; him the starry deeps , the empyrean glooms , and far-flashing splendors await .</p>
     <p>From the Onion Grove Phoenix .</p>
     <p>A talented young townsman of ours , recently returned from a Continental tour , and who is already favorably known to our readers by his sprightly letters from abroad which have graced our columns , called at our office yesterday . We learn from him , that , having enjoyed the distinguished privilege , while in Germany , of an introduction to the celebrated Von Humbug , he took the opportunity to present that eminent man with a copy of the ‘ Biglow Papers . ’ The next morning he received the following note , which he has kindly furnished us for publication . We prefer to print it verbatim , knowing that our readers will readily forgive the few errors into which the lllustrious writer has fallen , through ignorance of our language .</p>

     <p>PROEMIUM</p>
     <p>LECTORI BENEVOLO S .</p>
     <p>Toga scholastica nondum deposita , quum systemata varia entomologica , a viris ejus scientiæ cultoribus studiosissimis summa diligentia ædificata , penitus indagassem , non fuit quin luctuose omnibus in iis , quamvis aliter laude dignissimis , hiatum magni momenti perciperem . Tunc , nescio quo motu superiore impulsus , aut qua captus dulcedine operis , ad eum implendum ( Curtius alter ) me solemniter devovi . Nec ab isto labore , [ Greek : daimonios ] imposito , abstinui antequam tractatulum sufficienter inconcinnum lingua vernacula perfeceram . Inde , juveniliter tumefactus , et barathro ineptiæ [ Greek : ton bibliopolon ] ( necnon ‘ Publici Legentis ’ ) nusquam explorato , me composuisse quod quasi placentas præfervidas ( ut sic dicam ) homines ingurgitarent credidi . Sed , quum huic et alio bibliopolæ MSS . mea submisissem et nihil solidius responsione valde negativa in Musæum meum retulissem , horror ingens atque misericordia , ob crassitudinem Lambertianam in cerebris homunculorum istius muneris coelesti quadam ira infixam , me invasere . Extemplo mei solius impensis librum edere decrevi , nihil omnino dubitans quin ‘ Mundus Scientificus ’ ( ut aiunt ) crumenam meam ampliter repleret . Nullam , attamen , ex agro illo meo parvulo segetem demessui præter gaudium vacuum bene de Republica merendi . Iste panis meus pretiosus super aquas literarias fæculentas præfidenter jactus , quasi Harpyiaram quarundam ( scilicet bibliopolarum istorum facinorosorum supradictorum ) tactu rancidus , intra perpaucos dies mihi domum rediit . Et , quum ipse tali victu ali non tolerarem , primum in mentem venit pistori ( typographo nempe ) nihilominus solvendum esse . Animum non idcirco demisi , imo æque ac pueri naviculas suas penes se lino retinent ( eo ut e recto cursu delapsas ad ripam retrahant ) , sic ego Argâ meam chartaceam fluctibus laborantem a quæsitu velleris aurei , ipse potius tonsus pelleque exutus , mente solida revocavi . Metaphoram ut mutem , boomarangam meam a scopo aberrantem , retraxi , dum majore vi , occasione ministrante , adversus Fortunam intorquerem . Ast mihi , talia volventi , et , sicut Saturnus ille [ Greek : paidoboros ] , liberos intellectûs mei depascere fidenti , casus miserandus , nec antea inauditus , supervenit . Nam , ut ferunt Scythas pietatis causa et parsimoniæ , parentes suos mortuos devorâsse , sic filius hic meus primogenitus , Scythis ipsis minus mansuetus , patrem vivum totum et calcitrantem exsorbere enixus est . Nec tamen hac de causa sobolem meam esurientem exheredavi . Sed famem istam pro valido testimonio virilitatis roborisque potius habui , cibumque ad eam satiandam , salva paterna mea carne , petii . Et quia bilem illam scaturientem ad æs etiam concoquendum idoneam esse estimabam , unde æs alienum , ut minoris pretii , haberem , circumspexi . Rebus ita se habentibus , ab avunculo meo Johanne Doolittie , Armigero , impetravi ut pecunias necessarias suppeditaret , ne opus esset mihi universitatem relinquendi antequam ad gradum primum in artibus pervenissem . Tune ego , salvum facere patronum meum munificum maxime cupiens , omnes libros primæ editionis operis mei non venditos una cum privilegio in omne ævum ejusdem imprimendi et edendi avunculo meo dicto pigneravi . Ex illo die , atro lapide notando , curæ vociferantes familiæ singulis annis crescentis eo usque insultabant ut nunquam tam carum pignus e vinculis istis aheneis solvere possem .</p>
     <p>Avunculo vero nuper mortuo , quum inter alios consanguineos testamenti ejus lectionem audiendi causa advenissem , erectis auribus verba talia sequentia accepi : ‘ Quoniam persuasum habeo meum dilectum nepotem Homerum , longa et intima rerum angustarum domi experientia , aptissimum esse qui divitias tueatur , beneficenterque ac prudenter iis divinis creditis utatur ,— ergo , motus hisce cogitationibus , exque amore meo in illum magno , do , legoque nepoti caro meo supranominato omnes singularesque istas possessiones nec ponderabiles nec computabiles meas quæ sequuntur , scilicet : quingentos libros quos mihi pigneravit dictus Homerus , anno lucis 1792 , cum privilegio edendi et repetendi opus istud “ scientificum ” ( quod dicunt ) suum , si sic elegerit . Tamen D. O. M , precor oculos Homeri nepotis mei ita aperiat eumque moveat , ut libros istos in bibliotheca unius e plurimis castellis suis Hispaniensibus tuto abscondat . ’</p>
     <p>His verbis vix credibilibus , auditis , cor meum in pectore exsultavit . Deinde , quoniam tractatus Anglice scriptus spem auctoris fefellerat , quippe quum studium Historiæ Naturalis in Republica nostra inter factionis strepitum languescat , Latine versum edere statui , et eo potius quia nescio quomodo disciplina academica et duo diplomata proficiant , nisi quod peritos linguarum omnino mortuarum ( et damnandarum , ut dicebat iste [ Greek : panourgos ] Guilielmus Cobbett ) nos faciant .</p>
     <p>Et mihi adhue superstes est tota illa editio prima , quam quasi crepitaculum per quod dentes caninos dentibam retineo .</p>

     <p>NOTE TO TITLE-PAGE</p>
     <p>It will not have escaped the attentive eye , that I have , on the title-page , omitted those honorary appendages to the editorial name which not only add greatly to the value of every book , but whet and exacerbate the appetite of the reader . For not only does he surmise that an honorary membership of literary and scientific societies implies a certain amount of necessary distinction on the part of the recipient of such decorations , but he is willing to trust himself more entirely to an author who writes under the fearful responsibility of involving the reputation of such bodies as the S. Archæol . Dahom . or the Acad . Lit . et Scient . Kamtschat . I cannot but think that the early editions of Shakespeare and Milton would have met with more rapid and general acceptance , but for the barrenness of their respective title-pages ; and I believe that , even now , a publisher of the works of either of those justly distinguished men would find his account in procuring their admission to the membership of learned bodies on the Continent ,— a proceeding no whit more incongruous than the reversal of the judgment against Socrates , when he was already more than twenty centuries beyond the reach of antidotes , and when his memory had acquired a deserved respectability . I conceive that it was a feeling of the importance of this precaution which induced Mr. Locke to style himself ‘ Gent . ’ on the title-page of his Essay , as who should say to his readers that they could receive his metaphysics on the honor of a gentleman .</p>
     <p>Nevertheless , finding that , without descending to a smaller size of type than would have been compatible with the dignity of the several societies to be named , I could not compress my intended list within the limits of a single page , and thinking , moreover , that the act would carry with it an air of decorous modesty , I have chosen to take the reader aside , as it were , into my private closet , and there not only exhibit to him the diplomas which I already possess , but also to furnish him with a prophetic vision of those which I may , without undue presumption , hope for , as not beyond the reach of human ambition and attainment . And I am the rather induced to this from the fact that my name has been unaccountably dropped from the last triennial catalogue of our beloved Alma Mater . Whether this is to be attributed to the difficulty of Latinizing any of those honorary adjuncts ( with a complete list of which I took care to furnish the proper persons nearly a year beforehand ) , or whether it had its origin in any more culpable motives , I forbear to consider in this place , the matter being in course of painful investigation . But , however this may be , I felt the omission the more keenly , as I had , in expectation of the new catalogue , enriched the library of the Jaalam Athenæum with the old one then in my possession , by which means it has come about that my children will be deprived of a never-wearying winter evening 's amusement in looking out the name of their parent in that distinguished roll . Those harmless innocents had at least committed no — but I forbear , having intrusted my reflections and animadversions on this painful topic to the safe-keeping of my private diary , intended for posthumous publication . I state this fact here , in order that certain nameless individuals , who are , perhaps , overmuch congratulating themselves upon my silence , may know that a rod is in pickle which the vigorous hand of a justly incensed posterity will apply to their memories .</p>
     <p>The careful reader will note that , in the list which I have prepared , I have included the names of several Cisatlantic societies to which a place is not commonly assigned in processions of this nature . I have ventured to do this , not only to encourage native ambition and genius , but also because I have never been able to perceive in what way distance ( unless we suppose them at the end of a lever ) could increase the weight of learned bodies . As far as I have been able to extend my researches among such stuffed specimens as occasionally reach America , I have discovered no generic difference between the antipodal Fogrum Japonicum and the F. Americanum , sufficiently common in our own immediate neighborhood . Yet , with a becoming deference to the popular belief that distinctions of this sort are enhanced in value by every additional mile they travel , I have intermixed the names of some tolerably distant literary and other associations with the rest .</p>
     <p>I add here , also , an advertisement , which , that it may be the more readily understood by those persons especially interested therein , I have written in that curtailed and otherwise maltreated canine Latin , to the writing and reading of which they are accustomed .</p>

     <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
     <p>When , more than three years ago , my talented young parishioner , Mr. Biglow , came to me and submitted to my animadversions the first of his poems which he intended to commit to the more hazardous trial of a city newspaper , it never so much as entered my imagination to conceive that his productions would ever be gathered into a fair volume , and ushered into the august presence of the reading public by myself .</p>
     <p>So little are we short-sighted mortals able to predict the event ! I confess that there is to me a quite new satisfaction in being associated ( though only as sleeping partner ) in a book which can stand by itself in an independent unity on the shelves of libraries . For there is always this drawback from the pleasure of printing a sermon , that , whereas the queasy stomach of this generation will not bear a discourse long enough to make a separate volume , those religious and godly-minded children ( those Samuels , if I may call them so ) of the brain must at first be buried in an undistinguished heap , and then get such resurrection as is vouchsafed to them , mummy-wrapped with a score of others in a cheap binding , with no other mark of distinction than the word ‘ Miscellaneous ’ printed upon the back . Far be it from me to claim any credit for the quite unexpected popularity which I am pleased to find these bucolic strains have attained unto . If I know myself , I am measurably free from the itch of vanity ; yet I may be allowed to say that I was not backward to recognize in them a certain wild , puckery , acidulous ( sometimes even verging toward that point which , in our rustic phrase , is termed shut-eyed ) flavor , not wholly unpleasing , nor unwholesome , to palates cloyed with the sugariness of tamed and cultivated fruit . It may be , also , that some touches of my own , here and there , may have led to their wider acceptance , albeit solely from my larger experience of literature and authorship .<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span></p>
     <p>I was at first inclined to discourage Mr. Biglow 's attempts , as knowing that the desire to poetize is one of the diseases naturally incident to adolescence , which , if the fitting remedies be not at once and with a bold hand applied , may become chronic , and render one , who might else have become in due time an ornament of the social circle , a painful object even to nearest friends and relatives . But thinking , on a further experience that there was a germ of promise in him which required only culture and the pulling up of weeds from about it , I thought it best to set before him the acknowledged examples of English composition in verse , and leave the rest to natural emulation . With this view , I accordingly lent him some volumes of Pope and Goldsmith , to the assiduous study of which he promised to devote his evenings . Not long afterward , he brought me some verses written upon that model , a specimen of which I subjoin , having changed some phrases of less elegancy , and a few rhymes objectionable to the cultivated ear . The poem consisted of childish reminiscences , and the sketches which follow will not seem destitute of truth to those whose fortunate education began in a country village . And , first , let us hang up his charcoal portrait of the school-dame .</p>

       <l n="1">‘ Propped on the marsh , a dwelling now , I see</l>
       <l n="2">The humble school-house of my A , B , C ,</l>
       <l n="3">Where well-drilled urchins , each behind his tire ,</l>
       <l n="4">Waited in ranks the wished command to fire ,</l>
       <l n="5">Then all together , when the signal came ,</l>
       <l n="6">Discharged their a-b abs against the dame .</l>
       <l n="7">Daughter of Danaus , who could daily pour</l>
       <l n="8">In treacherous pipkins her Pierian store ,</l>
       <l n="9">She , mid the volleyed learning firm and calm ,</l>
       <l n="10">Patted the furloughed ferule on her palm ,</l>
       <l n="11">And , to our wonder , could divine at once</l>

       <l n="16">Who soonest to the topmost twig perspired ;</l>
       <l n="17">Each name was called as many various ways</l>
       <l n="18">As pleased the reader 's ear on different days ,</l>
       <l n="19">So that the weather , or the ferule 's stings ,</l>
       <l n="20">Colds in the head , or fifty other things ,</l>
       <l n="21">Transformed the helpless Hebrew thrice a week</l>

       <l n="24">Just as it pleased invention or despair ;</l>
       <l n="25">No controversial Hebraist was the Dame ;</l>
       <l n="26">With or without the points pleased her the same ;</l>
       <l n="27">If any tyro found a name too tough .</l>
       <l n="28">And looked at her , pride furnished skill enough ;</l>
       <l n="29">She nerved her larynx for the desperate thing ,</l>
       <l n="30">And cleared the five-barred syllables at a spring .</l>

       <l n="38">About my neck ( to be restored next day )</l>
       <l n="39">I carried home , rewards as shining then</l>
       <l n="40">As those that deck the lifelong pains of men ,</l>
       <l n="41">More solid than the redemanded praise</l>

       <l n="47">The impromptu pin-bent hook , the deep remorse</l>

       <l n="56">Shared with some dog , whose most beseeching tail</l>
       <l n="57">And dripping tongue and eager ears belied</l>
       <l n="58">The assumed indifference of canine pride ;</l>
       <l n="59">The caper homeward , shortened if the cart</l>
       <l n="60">Of Neighbor Pomeroy , trundling from the mart ,</l>
       <l n="61">O'ertook me ,— then , translated to the seat</l>

       <l n="64">Explained where horses should be thick , where thin ,</l>
       <l n="65">And warned me ( joke he always had in store )</l>

       <l n="67">What a fine natural courtesy was his !</l>
       <l n="68">His nod was pleasure , and his full bow bliss ;</l>
       <l n="69">How did his well-thumbed hat , with ardor rapt ,</l>
       <l n="70">Its curve decorous to each rank adapt !</l>
       <l n="71">How did it graduate with a courtly ease</l>
       <l n="72">The whole long scale of social differences ,</l>
       <l n="73">Yet so gave each his measure running o'er ,</l>
       <l n="74">None thought his own was less , his neighbor 's more ;</l>
       <l n="75">The squire was flattered , and the pauper knew</l>
       <l n="76">Old times acknowledged ‘ neath the threadbare blue !</l>
       <l n="77">Dropped at the corner of the embowered lane ,</l>
       <l n="78">Whistling I wade the knee-deep leaves again ,</l>
       <l n="79">While eager Argus , who has missed all day</l>
       <l n="80">The sharer of his condescending play ,</l>
       <l n="81">Comes leaping onward with a bark elate</l>
       <l n="82">And boisterous tail to greet me at the gate ;</l>
       <l n="83">That I was true in absence to our love</l>
       <l n="84">Let the thick dog'shYpppHeNears in my primer prove . ’</l>

     <p>I add only one further extract , which will possess a melancholy interest to all such as have endeavored to glean the materials of revolutionary history from the lips of aged persons , who took a part in the actual making of it , and , finding the manufacture profitable , continued the supply in an adequate proportion to the demand .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ Old Joe is gone , who saw hot Percy goad</l>
       <l n="2">His slow artillery lip the Concord road ,</l>
       <l n="3">A tale which grew in wonder , year by year ,</l>
       <l n="4">As , every time he told it , Joe drew near</l>
       <l n="5">To the main fight , till , faded and grown gray ,</l>
       <l n="6">The original scene to bolder tints gave way ;</l>
       <l n="7">Then Joe had heard the foe 's scared double-quick</l>
       <l n="8">Beat on stove drum with one un-captured stick ,</l>
       <l n="9">And , ere death came the lengthening tale to lop ,</l>
       <l n="10">Himself had fired , and seen a redcoat drop ;</l>
       <l n="11">Had Joe lived long enough , that scrambling fight</l>
       <l n="12">Had squared more nearly with his sense of right ,</l>
       <l n="13">And vanquished Percy , to complete the tale ,</l>
       <l n="14">Had hammered stone for life in Concord jail . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>I do not know that the foregoing extracts ought not to be called my own rather than Mr. Biglow 's , as , indeed , he maintained stoutly that my file had left nothing of his in them . I should not , perhaps , have felt entitled to take so great liberties with them , had I not more than suspected an hereditary vein of poetry in myself , a very near ancestor having written a Latin poem in the Harvard Gratulatio on the accession of George the Third . Suffice it to say , that , whether not satisfied with such limited approbation as I could conscientiously bestow , or from a sense of natural inaptitude , certain it is that my young friend could never be induced to any further essays in this kind . He affirmed that it was to him like writing in a foreign tongue ,— that Mr. Pope 's versification was like the regular ticking of one of Willard 's clocks , in which one could fancy , after long listening , a certain kind of rhythm or tune , but which yet was only a poverty-stricken tick , tick , after all ,— and that he had never seen a sweet-water on a trellis growing so fairly , or in forms so pleasing to his eye , as a fox-grape over a scrub-oak in a swamp . He added I know not what , to the effect that the sweet-water would only be the more disfigured by having its leaves starched and ironed out , and that Pegasus ( so he called him ) hardly looked right with his mane and tail in curl-papers . These and other such opinions I did not long strive to eradicate , attributing them rather to a defective education and senses untuned by too long familiarity with purely natural objects , than to a perverted moral sense . I was the more inclined to this leniency since sufficient evidence was not to seek , that his verses , wanting as they certainly were in classic polish and point , had somehow taken hold of the public ear in a surprising manner . So , only setting him right as to the quantity of the proper name Pegasus , I left him to follow the bent of his natural genius .</p>
     <p>Yet could I not surrender him wholly to the tutelage of the pagan ( which , literally interpreted , signifies village ) muse without yet a further effort for his conversion , and to this end I resolved that whatever of poetic fire yet burned in myself , aided by the assiduous bellows of correct models , should be put in requisition . Accordingly , when my ingenious young parishioner brought to my study a copy of verses which he had written touching the acquisition of territory resulting from the Mexican war , and the folly of leaving the question of slavery or freedom to the adjudication of chance , I did myself indite a short fable or apologue after the manner of Gay and Prior , to the end that he might see how easily even such subjects as he treated of were capable of a more refined style and more elegant expression . Mr. Biglow 's production was as follows :—</p>

      <head>LEAVING THE MATTER OPEN</head>
      <head>A TALE</head>
      <head>BY HOMER WILBUR , A. M .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Two brothers once , an ill-matched pair ,</l>
       <l n="2">Together dwelt ( no matter where ) ,</l>
       <l n="3">To whom an Uncle Sam , or some one ,</l>
       <l n="4">Had left a house and farm in common .</l>
       <l n="5">The two in principles and habits</l>
       <l n="6">Were different as rats from rabbits ;</l>
       <l n="7">Stout Farmer North , with frugal care ,</l>
       <l n="8">Laid up provision for his heir ,</l>
       <l n="9">Not scorning with hard sun-browned hands</l>
       <l n="10">To scrape acquaintance with his lands ;</l>
       <l n="11">Whatever thing he had to do</l>
       <l n="12">He did , and made it pay him , too ;</l>
       <l n="13">He sold his waste stone by the pound ,</l>
       <l n="14">His drains made water-wheels spin round ,</l>
       <l n="15">His ice in summer-time he sold ,</l>
       <l n="16">His wood brought profit when ‘ twas cold ,</l>
       <l n="17">He dug and delved from morn till night ,</l>
       <l n="18">Strove to make profit square with right ,</l>
       <l n="19">Lived on his means , cut no great dash ,</l>
       <l n="20">And paid his debts in honest cash .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="21">On tother hand , his brother South</l>
       <l n="22">Lived very much from hand to mouth .</l>
       <l n="23">Played gentleman , nursed dainty hands ,</l>
       <l n="24">Borrowed North 's money on his lands ,</l>
       <l n="25">And culled his morals and his graces</l>
       <l n="26">From cock-pits , bar-rooms , fights , and races ;</l>
       <l n="27">His sole work in the farming line</l>
       <l n="28">Was keeping droves of long-legged swine ,</l>
       <l n="29">Which brought great bothers and expenses</l>
       <l n="30">To North in looking after fences ,</l>
       <l n="31">And , when they happened to break through ,</l>
       <l n="32">Cost him both time and temper too ,</l>
       <l n="33">For South insisted it was plain</l>
       <l n="34">He ought to drive them home again ,</l>
       <l n="35">And North consented to the work</l>
       <l n="36">Because he loved to buy cheap pork .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="37">Meanwhile , South 's swine increasing fast ;</l>
       <l n="38">His farm became too small at last ;</l>
       <l n="39">So , having thought the matter over ,</l>
       <l n="40">And feeling bound to live in clover</l>
       <l n="41">And never pay the clover 's worth ,</l>
       <l n="42">He said one day to Brother North :—</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="43">‘ Our families are both increasing ,</l>
       <l n="44">And , though we labor without ceasing ,</l>
       <l n="45">Our produce soon will be too scant</l>
       <l n="46">To keep our children out of want ;</l>
       <l n="47">They who wish fortune to be lasting</l>
       <l n="48">Must be both prudent and forecasting ;</l>
       <l n="49">We soon shall need more land ; a lot</l>
       <l n="50">I know , that cheaply can be bo't ;</l>
       <l n="51">You lend the cash , I 'll buy the acres .</l>
       <l n="52">And we 'll be equally partakers . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="53">Poor North , whose Anglo-Saxon blood</l>
       <l n="54">Gave him a hankering after mud ,</l>
       <l n="55">Wavered a moment , then consented ,</l>
       <l n="56">And , when the cash was paid , repented ;</l>
       <l n="57">To make the new land worth a pin ,</l>
       <l n="58">Thought he , it must be all fenced in ,</l>
       <l n="59">For , if South 's swine once get the run on ‘ t</l>
       <l n="60">No kind of farming can be done on ‘ t ;</l>
       <l n="61">If that do n't suit the other side ,</l>
       <l n="62">‘ Tis best we instantly divide . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="63">But somehow South could ne'er incline</l>
       <l n="64">This way or that to run the line ,</l>
       <l n="65">And always found some new pretence</l>
       <l n="66">‘ Gainst setting the division fence ;</l>
       <l n="67">At last he said :—</l>
       <l n="68">‘ For peace 's sake ,</l>
       <l n="69">Liberal concessions I will make ;</l>
       <l n="70">Though I believe , upon my soul ,</l>
       <l n="71">I 've a just title to the whole ,</l>
       <l n="72">I 'll make an offer which I call</l>
       <l n="73">Gen'rous ,— we 'll have no fence at all ;</l>
       <l n="74">Then both of us , whene'er we choose ,</l>
       <l n="75">Can take what part we want to use ;</l>
       <l n="76">If you should chance to need it first ,</l>
       <l n="77">Pick you the best , I 'll take the worst . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="78">‘ Agreed ! ’ cried North ; thought he , This fall</l>
       <l n="79">With wheat and rye I 'll sow it all ;</l>
       <l n="80">In that way I shall get the start ,</l>
       <l n="81">And South may whistle for his part .</l>
       <l n="82">So thought , so done , the field was sown ,</l>
       <l n="83">And , winter haying come and gone ,</l>
       <l n="84">Sly North walked blithely forth to spy ,</l>
       <l n="85">The progress of his wheat and rye ;</l>
       <l n="86">Heavens , what a sight ! his brother 's swine</l>
       <l n="87">Had asked themselves all out to dine ;</l>
       <l n="88">Such grunting , munching , rooting , shoving ,</l>
       <l n="89">The soil seemed all alive and moving ,</l>
       <l n="90">As for his grain , such work they 'd made on ‘ t ,</l>
       <l n="91">He could n't spy a single blade on ‘ t .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="92">Off in a rage he rushed to South ,</l>
       <l n="93">‘ My wheat and rye ’ — grief choked his mouth :</l>
       <l n="94">‘ Pray do n't mind me , ’ said South , ‘ but plant</l>
       <l n="95">All of the new land that you want ; ’</l>
       <l n="96">‘ Yes , but your hogs , ’ cried North ;</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="97">‘ The grain</l>
       <l n="98">Wo n't hurt them , ’ answered South again ;</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="100">‘ No doubt ;</l>

       <l n="103">You must not sow it in their way ; ’</l>
       <l n="104">‘ Nay , you , ’ says North , ‘ must keep them out ; ’</l>
       <l n="105">‘ Did I create them with a snout ? ’</l>
       <l n="106">Asked South demurely ; ‘ as agreed ,</l>
       <l n="107">The land is open to your seed ,</l>
       <l n="108">And would you fain prevent my pigs</l>
       <l n="109">From running there their harmless rigs ?</l>
       <l n="110">God knows I view this compromise</l>
       <l n="111">With not the most approving eyes ;</l>
       <l n="112">I gave up my unquestioned rights</l>
       <l n="113">For sake of quiet days and nights ;</l>
       <l n="114">I offered then , you know ‘ tis true ,</l>
       <l n="115">To cut the piece of land in two . ’</l>
       <l n="116">‘ Then cut it now , ’ growls North ;</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="117">‘ Abate</l>
       <l n="118">Your heat , ’ says South , ‘ tis now too late ;</l>

       <l n="120">But you , of your own good the scorner ,</l>
       <l n="121">Refused to take it : I am sorry ;</l>
       <l n="122">No doubt you might have found a quarry ,</l>
       <l n="123">Perhaps a gold-mine , for aught I know ,</l>
       <l n="124">Containing heaps of native rhino ;</l>
       <l n="125">You can n't expect me to resign</l>

       <l n="127">‘ But where , ’ quoth North , ‘ are mine ? ’</l>
       <l n="128">‘ Your rights , ’ says tother , ‘ well , that 's funny ,</l>
       <l n="129">I bought the land ’ —</l>
       <l n="130">‘ I paid the money ; ’</l>
       <l n="131">‘ That , ’ answered South , ‘ is from the point ,</l>
       <l n="132">The ownership , you 'll grant , is joint ;</l>
       <l n="133">I 'm sure my only hope and trust is</l>
       <l n="134">Not law so much as abstract justice ,</l>
       <l n="135">Though , you remember , ‘ twas agreed</l>

       <l n="139">Quashes them at the point we 've got to ;</l>
       <l n="140">Obsta principiis that 's my motto . ’</l>
       <l n="141">So saying , South began to whistle</l>
       <l n="142">And looked as obstinate as gristle ,</l>
       <l n="143">While North went homeward , each brown paw</l>
       <l n="144">Clenched like a knot of natural law ,</l>
       <l n="145">And all the while , in either ear ,</l>
       <l n="146">Heard something clicking wondrous clear .</l>

     <p>To turn now to other matters , there are two things upon which it should seem fitting to dilate somewhat more largely in this place ,— the Yankee character and the Yankee dialect . And , first , of the Yankee character , which has wanted neither open maligners , nor even more dangerous enemies in the persons of those unskilful painters who have given to it that hardness , angularity , and want of proper perspective , which , in truth , belonged , not to their subject , but to their own niggard and unskilful pencil .</p>
     <p>New England was not so much the colony of a mother country , as a Hagar driven forth into the wilderness . The little self-exiled band which came hither in 1620 came , not to seek gold , but to found a democracy . They came that they might have the privilege to work and pray , to sit upon hard benches and listen to painful preachers as long as they would , yea , even unto thirty-seventhly , if the spirit so willed it . And surely , if the Greek might boast his Thermopylæ , where three hundred men fell in resisting the Persian , we may well be proud of our Plymouth Rock , where a handful of men , women , and children not merely faced , but vanquished , winter , famine , the wilderness , and the yet more invincible storge that drew them back to the green island far away . These found no lotus growing upon the surly shore , the taste of which could make them forget their little native Ithaca ; nor were they so wanting to themselves in faith as to burn their ship , but could see the fair west-wind belly the homeward sail , and then turn unrepining to grapple with the terrible Unknown .</p>
     <p>As Want was the prime foe these hardy exodists had to fortress themselves against , so it is little wonder if that traditional feud be long in wearing out of the stock . The wounds of the old warfare were long a-healing , and an east-wind of hard times puts a new ache into every one of them . Thrift was the first lesson in their horn-book , pointed out , letter after letter , by the lean finger of the hard schoolmistress , Necessity . Neither were those plump , rosy-gilled Englishmen that came hither , but a hard-faced , atrabilious , earnest-eyed race , stiff from long wrestling with the Lord in prayer , and who had taught Satan to dread the new Puritan hug . Add two hundred years ’ influence of soil , climate , and exposure , with its necessary result of idiosyncrasies , and we have the present Yankee , full of expedients , half-master of all trades , inventive in all but the beautiful , full of shifts , not yet capable of comfort , armed at all points against the old enemy Hunger , longanimous , good at patching , not so careful for what is best as for what will do , with a clasp to his purse and a button to his pocket , not skilled to build against Time , as in old countries , but against sore-pressing Need , accustomed to move the world with no [ Greek : pou sto ] but his own two feet , and no lever but his own long forecast . A strange hybrid , indeed , did circumstance beget , here in the New World , upon the old Puritan stock , and the earth never before saw such mystic-practicalism , such niggard-geniality , such calculating-fanaticism , such cast-iron-enthusiasm , such sour-faced-humor , such close-fisted-generosity . This new Græculus esuriens will make a living out of anything . He will invent new trades as well as tools . His brain is his capital , and he will get education at all risks . Put him on Juan Fernandez , and he would make a spelling-book first , and a salt-pan afterward . In coelum , jusseris , ibit ,— or the other way either ,— it is all one , so anything is to be got by it . Yet , after all , thin , speculative Jonathan is more like the Englishman of two centuries ago than John Bull himself is . He has lost somewhat in solidity , has become fluent and adaptable , but more of the original groundwork of character remains . He feels more at home with Fulke Greville , Herbert of Cherbury , Quarles , George Herbert , and Browne , than with his modern English cousins . He is nearer than John , by at least a hundred years , to Naseby , Marston Moor , Worcester , and the time when , if ever , there were true Englishmen . John Bull has suffered the idea of the Invisible to be very much fattened out of him . Jonathan is conscious still that he lives in the world of the Unseen as well as of the Seen . To move John you must make your fulcrum of solid beef and pudding ; an abstract idea will do for Jonathan .</p>
     <p>*** TO THE INDULGENT READER</p>
     <p>My friend , the Rev . Mr. Wilbur , having been seized with a dangerous fit of illness , before this Introduction had passed through the press , and being incapacitated for all literary exertion , sent to me his notes , memoranda , &amp; c ., and requested me to fashion them into some shape more fitting for the general eye . This , owing to the fragmentary and disjointed state of his manuscripts , I have felt wholly unable to do ; yet being unwilling that the reader should be deprived of such parts of his lucubrations as seemed more finished , and not well discerning how to segregate these from the rest , I have concluded to send them all to the press precisely as they are .</p>

     <p>It remains to speak of the Yankee dialect . And , first , it may be premised , in a general way , that any one much read in the writings of the early colonists need not be told that the far greater share of the words and phrases now esteemed peculiar to New England , and local there , were brought from the mother country . A person familiar with the dialect of certain portions of Massachusetts will not fail to recognize , in ordinary discourse , many words now noted in English vocabularies as archaic , the greater part of which were in common use about the time of the King James translation of the Bible . Shakespeare stands less in need of a glossary to most New-Englanders than to many a native of the Old Country . The peculiarities of our speech , however , are rapidly wearing out . As there is no country where reading is so universal and newspapers are so multitudinous , so no phrase remains long local , but is transplanted in the mail-bags to every remotest corner of the land . Consequently our dialect approaches nearer to uniformity than that of any other nation .</p>
     <p>The English have complained of us for coining new words . Many of those so stigmatized were old ones by them forgotten , and all make now an unquestioned part of the currency , wherever English is spoken . Undoubtedly , we have a right to make new words , as they are needed by the fresh aspects under which life presents itself here in the New World ; and , indeed , wherever a language is alive , it grows . It might be questioned whether we could not establish a stronger title to the ownership of the English tongue than the mother-islanders themselves . Here , past all question , is to be its great home and centre . And not only is it already spoken here by greater numbers , but with a far higher popular average of correctness than in Britain . The great writers of it , too , we might claim as ours , were ownership to be settled by the number of readers and lovers .</p>
     <p>As regards the provincialisms to be met with in this volume , I may say that the reader will not find one which is not ( as I believe ) either native or imported with the early settlers , nor one which I have not , with my own ears , heard in familiar use . In the metrical portion of the book , I have endeavored to adapt the spelling as nearly as possible to the ordinary mode of pronunciation . Let the reader who deems me over-particular remember this caution of Martial :—</p>

     </lg>
     <p>1 . The genuine Yankee never gives the rough sound to the r when he can help it , and often displays considerable ingenuity in avoiding it even before a vowel .</p>
     <p>2 . He seldom sounds the final g , a piece of self-denial , if we consider his partiality for nasals . The same of the final d , as han ’ and stan ’ for hand and stand .</p>
     <p>3 . The h in such words as while , when , where , he omits altogether .</p>
     <p>4 . In regard to a , he shows some inconsistency , sometimes giving a close and obscure sound , as hev for have , hendy for handy , ez for as , thet for that , and again giving it the broad sound it has in father , as hânsome for handsome .</p>
     <p>5 . To the sound ou he prefixes an e ( hard to exemplify otherwise than orally ) .</p>
     <p>The following passage in Shakespeare he would recite thus :—</p>

     <p>[ Greek : a ] . Unable to procure a likeness of Mr. Biglow , I thought the curious reader might be gratified with a sight of the editorial effigies . And here a choice between two was offered ,— the one a profile ( entirely black ) cut by Doyle , the other a portrait painted by a native artist of much promise . The first of these seemed wanting in expression , and in the second a slight obliquity of the visual organs has been heightened ( perhaps from an over-desire of force on the part of the artist ) into too close an approach to actual strabismus . This slight divergence in my optical apparatus from the ordinary model — however I may have been taught to regard it in the light of a mercy rather than a cross , since it enabled me to give as much of directness and personal application to my discourses as met the wants of my congregation , without risk of offending any by being supposed to have him or her in my eye ( as the saying is ) — seemed yet to Mrs. Wilbur a sufficient objection to the engraving of the aforesaid painting . We read of many who either absolutely refused to allow the copying of their features , as especially did Plotinus and Agesilaus among the ancients , not to mention the more modern instances of Scioppius , Palæottus , Pinellus , Velserus , Gataker , and others , or were indifferent thereto , as Cromwell .</p>
     <p>[ Greek : b . ] Yet was Cæsar desirous of concealing his baldness . Per contra , my Lord Protector 's carefulness in the matter of his wart might be cited . Men generally more desirous of being improved in their portraits than characters . Shall probably find very unflattered likenesses of ourselves in Recording Angel 's gallery .</p>
     <p>[ Greek : g .] Whether any of our national peculiarities may be traced to our use of stoves , as a certain closeness of the lips in pronunciation , and a smothered smoulderingness of disposition seldom roused to open flame ? An unrestrained intercourse with fire probably conducive to generosity and hospitality of soul . Ancient Mexicans used stoves , as the friar Augustin Ruiz reports , Hakluyt , III . 468 ,— but Popish priests not always reliable authority .</p>
     <p>To-day picked my Isabella grapes . Crop injured by attacks of rose-bug in the spring . Whether Noah was justifiable in preserving this class of insects ?</p>
     <p>[ Greek : d ] . Concerning Mr. Biglow 's pedigree . Tolerably certain that there was never a poet among his ancestors . An ordination hymn attributed to a maternal uncle , but perhaps a sort of production not demanding the creative faculty .</p>
     <p>His grandfather a painter of the grandiose or Michael Angelo school . Seldom painted objects smaller than houses or barns , and these with uncommon expression .</p>
     <p>[ Greek : e ] . Of the Wilburs no complete pedigree . The crest said to be a wild boar , whence , perhaps , the name . (? ) A connection with the Earls of Wilbraham ( quasi wild boar ham ) might be made out . This suggestion worth following up . In 1677 , John W. m . Expect ——, had issue , 1 . John , 2 . Haggai , 3 . Expect , 4 . Ruhamah , 5 . Desire .</p>

     <p>But if this were the case , she seems to have died early ; for only three years after , namely , 1714 , we have evidence that he married Winifred , daughter of Lieutenant Tipping .</p>
     <p>He seems to have been a man of substance , for we find him in 1696 conveying ‘ one undivided eightieth part of a salt-meadow ’ in Yabbok , and he commanded a sloop in 1702 .</p>
     <p>Those who doubt the importance of genealogical studies fuste potius quam argumento erudiendi .</p>
     <p>I trace him as far as 1723 , and there lose him . In that year he was chosen selectman .</p>
     <p>No gravestone . Perhaps overthrown when new hearse-house was built , 1802 .</p>
     <p>He was probably the son of John , who came from Bilham Comit . Salop . circa 1642 .</p>

     <p>It is greatly to be lamented that this curious epitaph is mutilated . It is said that the sacrilegious British soldiers made a target of the stone during the war of Independence . How odious an animosity which pauses not at the grave ! How brutal that which spares not the monuments of authentic history ! This is not improbably from the pen of Rev . Moody Pyram , who is mentioned by Hubbard as having been noted for a silver vein of poetry . If his papers be still extant , a copy might possibly be recovered .</p>

      <head>FROM MR. EZEKIEL BIGLOW OF JAALAM TO THE HON . JOSEPH T. BUCKINGHAM , EDITOR OF THE BOSTON COURIER , INCLOSING A POEM OF HIS SON , MR. HOSEA BIGLOW</head>
       <l n="1">JAYLEM , june 1846 .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>MISTER EDDYTER :— Our Hosea wuz down to Boston last week , and he see a cruetin Sarjunt a struttin round as popler as a hen with 1 chicking , with 2 fellers a drummin and fifin arter him like all nater . the sarjunt he thout Hosea hed n't gut his i teeth cut cos he looked a kindo ‘ s though he 'd jest com down , so he cal'lated to hook him in , but Hosy wood n't take none o ’ his sarse for all he hed much as 20 Rooster 's tales stuck onto his hat and eenamost enuf brass a bobbin up and down on his shoulders and figureed onto his coat and trousis , let alone wut nater hed sot in his featers , to make a 6 pounder out on .</p>
     <p>wal , Hosea he com home considerabal riled , and arter I 'd gone to bed I heern Him a thrashin round like a short-tailed Bull in fli-time . The old Woman ses she to me ses she , Zekle , ses she , our Hosee 's gut the chollery or suthin anuther ses she , do n't you Bee skeered , ses I , he 's oney amakin pottery<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>ses i , he 's ollers on hand at that ere busynes like Da &amp; martin , and shure enuf , cum mornin , Hosy he cum down stares full chizzle , hare on eend and cote tales flyin , and sot rite of to go reed his varses to Parson Wilbur bein he haint aney grate shows o ’ book larnin himself , bimeby he cum back and sed the parson wuz dreffle tickled with ‘ em as i hoop you will Be , and said they wuz True grit .</p>
     <p>Hosea ses taint hardly fair to call ‘ em hisn now , cos the parson kind o ’ slicked off sum o ’ the last varses , but he told Hosee he did n't want to put his ore in to tetch to the Rest on ‘ em , bein they wuz verry well As thay wuz , and then Hosy ses he sed suthin a nuther about Simplex Mundishes or sum sech feller , but I guess Hosea kind o ’ did n't hear him , for I never hearn o ’ nobody o ’ that name in this villadge , and I 've lived here man and boy 76 year cum next tater diggin , and thair aint no wheres a kitting spryer ‘ n I be .</p>

     <note>The first recruiting sergeant on record I conceive to have been that individual who is mentioned in the Book of Job as going to and fro in the earth , and walking up and down in it . Bishop Latimer will have him to have been a bishop , but to me that other calling would appear more congenial . The sect of Cainites is not yet extinct , who esteemed the first-born of Adam to be the most worthy , not only because of that privilege of primogeniture , but inasmuch as he was able to overcome and slay his younger brother . That was a wise saying of the famous Marquis Pescara to the Papal Legate , that it was impossible for men to serve Mars and Christ at the same time . Yet in time past the profession of arms was judged to be [ Greek : kat exochaen ] that of a gentleman , nor does this opinion want for strenuous upholders even in our day . Must we suppose , then , that the profession of Christianity was only intended for losels , or , at best , to afford an opening for plebeian ambition ? Or shall we hold with that nicely metaphysical Pomeranian , Captain Vratz , who was Count Königsmark 's chief instrument in the murder of Mr. Thynne , that the Scheme of Salvation has been arranged with an especial eye to the necessities of the upper classes , and that ‘ God would consider a gentleman and deal with him suitably to the condition and profession he had placed him in ’ ? It may be said of us all , Exemplo plus quam ratione vivimus .— H. W .</note>

     <p>A LETTER</p>
     <p>FROM MR. HOSEA BIGLOW TO THE HON . J. T . BUCKINGHAM , EDITOR OF THE BOSTON COURIER , COVERING A LETTER FROM MR. B. SAWIN , PRIVATE IN THE MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT</p>
     <note>This letter of Mr. Sawin 's was not originally written in verse . Mr. Biglow , thinking it peculiarly susceptible of metrical adornment , translated it , so to speak , into his own vernacular tongue . This is not the time to consider the question , whether rhyme be a mode of expression natural to the human race . If leisure from other and more important avocations be granted , I will handle the matter more at large in an appendix to the present volume . In this place I will barely remark , that I have sometimes noticed in the unlanguaged prattlings of infants a fondness for alliteration , assonance , and even rhyme , in which natural predisposition we may trace the three degrees through which our Anglo-Saxon verse rose to its culmination in the poetry of Pope . I would not be understood as questioning in these remarks that pious theory which supposes that children , if left entirely to themselves , would naturally discourse in Hebrew . For this the authority of one experiment is claimed , and I could , with Sir Thomas Browne , desire its establishment , inasmuch as the acquirement of that sacred tongue would thereby be facilitated . I am aware that Herodotus states the conclusion of Psammetieus to have been in favor of a dialect of the Phrygian . But , beside the chance that a trial of this importance would hardly be blessed to a Pagan monarch whose only motive was curiosity , we have on the Hebrew side the comparatively recent investigation of James the Fourth of Scotland . I will add to this prefatory remark , that Mr. Sawin , though a native of Jaalam , has never been a stated attendant on the religious exercises of my congregation . I consider my humble efforts prospered in that not one of my sheep hath ever indued the wolf 's clothing of war , save for the comparatively innocent diversion of a militia training . Not that my flock are backward to undergo the hardships of defensive warfare . They serve cheerfully in the great army which fights , even unto death pro aris et focis , accoutred with the spade , the axe , the plane , the sledge , the spelling-book , and other such effectual weapons against want and ignorance and unthrift . I have taught them ( under God ) to esteem our human institutions as but tents of a night , to be stricken whenever Truth puts the bugle to her lips and sounds a march to the heights of wider-viewed intelligence and more perfect organization .— H. W .</note>

     <p>[ Those have not been wanting ( as , indeed , when hath Satan been to seek for attorneys ? ) who have maintained that our late inroad upon Mexico was undertaken not so much for the avenging of any national quarrel , as for the spreading of free institutions and of Protestantism . Capita vix duabus Anticyris medenda ! Verily I admire that no pious sergeant among these new Crusaders beheld Martin Luther riding at the front of the host upon a tamed pontifical bull , as , in that former invasion of Mexico , the zealous Gomara ( spawn though he were of the Scarlet Woman ) was favored with a vision of St. James of Compostella , skewering the infidels upon his apostolical lance . We read , also , that Richard of the lion heart , having gone to Palestine on a similar errand of mercy , was divinely encouraged to cut the throats of such Paynims as refused to swallow the bread of life ( doubtless that they might be thereafter incapacitated for swallowing the filthy gobbets of Mahound ) by angels of heaven , who cried to the king and his knights ,— Seigneurs , tuez ! tuez ! providentially using the French tongue , as being the only one understood by their auditors . This would argue for the pantoglottism of these celestial intelligences , while , on the other hand , the Devil , teste Cotton Mather , is unversed in certain of the Indian dialects . Yet must he be a semeiologist the most expert , making himself intelligible to every people and kindred by signs ; no other discourse , indeed , being needful , than such as the mackerel-fisher holds with his finned quarry , who , if other bait be wanting , can by a bare bit of white rag at the end of a string captivate those foolish fishes . Such piscatorial persuasion is Satan cunning in . Before one he trails a hat and feather , or a bare feather without a hat ; before another , a Presidential chair or a tide-waiter 's stool , or a pulpit in the city , no matter what . To us , dangling there over our heads , they seem junkets dropped out of the seventh heaven , sops dipped in nectar , but , once in our mouths , they are all one , bits of fuzzy cotton .</p>
     <p>This , however , by the way . It is time now revocare gradum . While so many miracles of this sort , vouched by eye-witnesses , have encouraged the arms of Papists , not to speak of Echetlæus at Marathon and those Dioscuri ( whom we must conclude imps of the pit ) who sundry times captained the pagan Roman soldiery , it is strange that our first American crusade was not in some such wise also signalized . Yet it is said that the Lord hath manifestly prospered our armies . This opens the question , whether , when our hands are strengthened to make great slaughter of our enemies , it be absolutely and demonstratively certain that this might is added to us from above , or whether some Potentate from an opposite quarter may not have a finger in it , as there are few pies into which his meddling digits are not thrust . Would the Sanctifier and Setter-apart of the seventh day have assisted in a victory gained on the Sabbath , as was one in the late war ? Do we not know from Josephus , that , careful of His decree , a certain river in Judaea abstained from flowing on the day of Rest ? Or has that day become less an object of His especial care since the year 1697 , when so manifest a providence occurred to Mr. William Trowbridge , in answer to whose prayers , when he and all on shipboard with him were starving , a dolphin was sent daily , ‘ which was enough to serve ‘ em ; only on Saturdays they still catched a couple , and on the Lord 's Days they could catch none at all ’ ? Haply they might have been permitted , by way of mortification , to take some few sculpins ( those banes of the salt-water angler ) , which unseemly fish would , moreover , have conveyed to them a symbolical reproof for their breach of the day , being known in the rude dialect of our mariners as Cape Cod Clergymen .</p>
     <p>It has been a refreshment to many nice consciences to know that our Chief Magistrate would not regard with eyes of approval the ( by many esteemed ) sinful pastime of dancing , and I own myseif to be so far of that mind , that I could not but set my face against this Mexican Polka , though danced to the Presidential piping with a Gubernatorial second . If ever the country should be seized with another such mania pro propaganda fide , I think it would be wise to fill our bombshells with alternate copies of the Cambridge Platform and the Thirty-nine Articles , which would produce a mixture of the highest explosive power , and to wrap every one of our cannon-balls in a leaf of the New Testament , the reading of which is denied to those who sit in the darkness of Popery . Those iron evangelists would thus be able to disseminate vital religion and Gospel truth in quarters inaccessible to the ordinary missionary . I have seen lads , unimpregnate with the more sublimated punctiliousness of Walton , secure pickerel , taking their unwary siesta beneath the lily-pads too nigh the surface , with a gun and small shot . Why not , then , since gunpowder was unknown in the time of the Apostles ( not to enter here upon the question whether it were discovered before that period by the Chinese ) , suit our metaphor to the age in which we live , and say shooters as well as fishers of men ?</p>
     <p>I do much fear that we shall be seized now and then with a Protestant fervor , as long as we have neighbor Naboths whose wallowings in Papistical mire excite our horror in exact proportion to the size and desirableness of their vineyards . Yet I rejoice that some earnest Protestants have been made by this war ,— I mean those who protested against it . Fewer they were than I could wish , for one might imagine America to have been colonized by a tribe of those nondescript African animals the Aye-Ayes , so difficult a word is No to us all . There is some malformation or defect of the vocal organs , which either prevents our uttering it at all , or gives it so thick a pronunciation as to be unintelligible . A mouth filled with the national pudding , or watering in expectation thereof , is wholly incompetent to this refractory monosyllable . An abject and herpetic Public Opinion is the Pope , the Anti-Christ , for us to protest against e corde cordium . And by what College of Cardinals is this our God'shYpppHeNvicar , our binder and looser , elected ? Very like , by the sacred conclave of Tag , Rag , and Bobtail , in the gracious atmosphere of the grog-shop . Yet it is of this that we must all be puppets . This thumps the pulpit-cushion , this guides the editor 's pen , this wags the senator 's tongue . This decides what Scriptures are canonical , and shuffles Christ away into the Apocrypha . According to that sentence fathered upon Solon , [ Greek : Onto daemosion kakon erchetai oikad ekasto ] This unclean spirit is skilful to assume various shapes . I have known it to enter my own study and nudge my elbow of a Saturday , under the semblance of a wealthy member of my congregation . It were a great blessing , if every particular of what in the sum we call popular sentiment could carry about the name of its manufacturer stamped legibly upon it . I gave a stab under the fifth rib to that pestilent fallacy ,— ‘ Our country , right or wrong , ’ — by tracing its original to a speech of Ensign Cilley at a dinner of the Bungtown Fencibles .— H.

     <p>WHAT MR. ROBINSON THINKS</p>
     <p>[ A few remarks on the following verses will not be out of place . The satire in them was not meant to have any personal , but only a general , application . Of the gentleman upon whose letter they were intended as a commentary Mr. Biglow had never heard , till he saw the letter itself . The position of the satirist is oftentimes one which he would not have chosen , had the election been left to himself . In attacking bad principles , he is obliged to select some individual who has made himself their exponent , and in whom they are impersonate , to the end that what he says may not , through ambiguity , be dissipated tenues in auras . For what says Seneca ? Longum iter per præcepta , breve et efficace per exempla . A bad principle is comparatively harmless while it continues to be an abstraction , nor can the general mind comprehend it fully till it is printed in that large type which all men can read at sight , namely , the life and character , the sayings and doings , of particular persons . It is one of the cunningest fetches of Satan , that he never exposes himself directly to our arrows , but , still dodging behind this neighbor or that acquaintance , compels us to wound him through them , if at all . He holds our affections as hostages , the while he patches up a truce with our conscience .</p>
     <p>Meanwhile , let us not forget that the aim of the true satirist is not to be severe upon persons , but only upon falsehood , and , as Truth and Falsehood start from the same point , and sometimes even go along together for a little way , his business is to follow the path of the latter after it diverges , and to show her floundering in the bog at the end of it . Truth is quite beyond the reach of satire . There is so brave a simplicity in her , that she can no more be made ridiculous than an oak or a pine . The danger of the satirist is , that continual use may deaden his sensibility to the force of language . He becomes more and more liable to strike harder than he knows or intends . He may be careful to put on his boxing-gloves , and yet forget that , the older they grow , the more plainly may the knuckles inside be felt . Moreover , in the heat of contest , the eye is insensibly drawn to the crown of victory , whose tawdry tinsel glitters through that dust of the ring which obscures Truth 's wreath of simple leaves . I have sometimes thought that my young friend , Mr. Biglow , needed a monitory hand laid on his arm ,— aliquid sufflaminandus erat . I have never thought it good husbandry to water the tender plants of reform with aqua fortis , yet , where so much is to do in the beds , he were a sorry gardener who should wage a whole day 's war with an iron scuffle on those ill weeds that make the garden-walks of life unsightly , when a sprinkle of Attic salt will wither them up . Est ars etiam maledicendi , says Scaliger , and truly it is a hard thing to say where the graceful gentleness of the lamb merges in downright sheepishness . We may conclude with worthy and wise Dr. Fuller , that ‘ one may be a lamb in private wrongs , but in hearing general affronts to goodness they are asses which are not lions . ’ — H. W . ]</p>

     <p>[ The attentive reader will doubtless have perceived in the foregoing poem an allusion to that pernicious sentiment ,— ‘ Our country , right or wrong . ’ It is an abuse of language to call a certain portion of land , much more , certain personages , elevated for the time being to high station , our country . I would not sever nor loosen a single one of those ties by which we are united to the spot of our birth , nor minish by a tittle the respect due to the Magistrate . I love our own Bay State too well to do the one , and as for the other , I have myself for nigh forty years exercised , however unworthily , the function of Justice of the Peace , having been called thereto by the unsolicited kindness of that most excellent man and upright patriot , Caleb Strong . Patriæ fumus igne alieno luculentior is best qualified with this ,— Ubi libertas , ibi patria . We are inhabitants of two worlds , and owe a double , but not a divided , allegiance . In virtue of our clay , this little ball of earth exacts a certain loyalty of us , while , in our capacity as spirits , we are admitted citizens of an invisible and holier fatherland . There is a patriotism of the soul whose claim absolves us from our other and terrene fealty . Our true country is that ideal realm which we represent to ourselves under the names of religion , duty , and the like . Our terrestrial organizations are but far-off approaches to so fair a model , and all they are verily traitors who resist not any attempt to divert them from this their original intendment . When , therefore , one would have us to fling up our caps and shout with the multitude ,— ‘ Our country , however bounded ! ’ he demands of us that we sacrifice the larger to the less , the higher to the lower , and that we yield to the imaginary claims of a few acres of soil our duty and privilege as liegemen of Truth . Our true country is bounded on the north and the south , on the east and the west , by Justice , and when she oversteps that invisible boundary-line by so much as a hair'shYpppHeNbreadth , she ceases to be our mother , and chooses rather to be looked upon quasi noverca . That is a hard choice when our earthly love of country calls upon us to tread one path and our duty points us to another . We must make as noble and becoming an election as did Penelope between Icarius and Ulysses . Veiling our faces , we must take silently the hand of Duty to follow her .</p>
     <p>Shortly after the publication of the foregoing poem , there appeared some comments upon it in one of the public prints which seemed to call for animadversion . I accordingly addressed to Mr. Buckingham , of the Boston Courier , the following letter .</p>
     <p>JAALAM , November 4 , 1847 .</p>
     <p>‘ To the Editor of the Courier :</p>
     <p>‘ RESPECTED SIR ,— Calling at the post-office this morning , our worthy and efficient postmaster offered for my perusal a paragraph in the Boston Morning Post of the 3d instant , wherein certain effusions of the pastoral muse are attributed to the pen of Mr. James Russell Lowell . For aught I know or can affirm to the contrary , this Mr. Lowell may be a very deserving person and a youth of parts ( though I have seen verses of his which I could never rightly understand ) ; and if he be such , he , I am certain , as well as I , would be free from any proclivity to appropriate to himself whatever of credit ( or discredit ) may honestly belong to another . I am confident , that , in penning these few lines , I am only forestalling a disclaimer from that young gentleman , whose silence hitherto , when rumor pointed to himward , has excited in my bosom mingled emotions of sorrow and surprise . Well may my young parishioner , Mr. Biglow , exclaim with the poet ,</p>
     <p>“ Sic vos non vobis , ” &amp; c .;</p>
     <p>though , in saying this , I would not convey the impression that he is a proficient in the Latin tongue ,— the tongue , I might add , of a Horace and a Tully .</p>
     <p>‘ Mr. B. does not employ his pen , I can safely say , for any lucre of worldly gain , or to be exalted by the carnal plaudits of men , digito monstrari , &amp; c. He does not wait upon Providence for mercies , and in his heart mean merces . But I should esteem myself as verily deficient in my duty ( who am his friend and in some unworthy sort his spiritual fidus Achates , &amp; c .) , if I did not step forward to claim for him whatever measure of applause might be assigned to him by the judicious .</p>
     <p>‘ If this were a fitting occasion , I might venture here a brief dissertation touching the manner and kind of my young friend 's poetry . But I dubitate whether this abstruser sort of speculation ( though enlivened by some apposite instances from Aristophanes ) would sufficiently interest your oppidan readers . As regards their satirical tone , and their plainness of speech , I will only say , that , in my pastoral experience , I have found that the Arch-Enemy loves nothing better than to be treated as a religious , moral , and intellectual being , and that there is no apage Sathanas ! so potent as ridicule . But it is a kind of weapon that must have a button of good-nature on the point of it .</p>
     <p>‘ The productions of Mr. B. have been stigmatized in some quarters as unpatriotic ; but I can vouch that he loves his native soil with that hearty , though discriminating , attachment which springs from an intimate social intercourse of many years ’ standing . In the ploughing season , no one has a deeper share in the well-being of the country than he . If Dean Swift were right in saying that he who makes two blades of grass grow where one grew before confers a greater benefit on the state than he who taketh a city , Mr. B. might exhibit a fairer claim to the Presidency than General Scott himself . I think that some of those disinterested lovers of the hard-handed democracy , whose fingers have never touched anything rougher than the dollars of our common country , would hesitate to compare palms with him . It would do your heart good , respected Sir , to see that young man mow . He cuts a cleaner and wider swath than any in this town .</p>
     <p>‘ But it is time for me to be at my Post . It is very clear that my young friend 's shot has struck the lintel , for the Post is shaken ( Amos ix . 1 ) . The editor of that paper is a strenuous advocate of the Mexican war , and a colonel , as I am given to understand . I presume , that , being necessarily absent in Mexico , he has left his journal in some less judicious hands . At any rate , the Post has been too swift on this occasion . It could hardly have cited a more incontrovertible line from any poem than that which it has selected for animadversion , namely ,—</p>
     <p>“ We kind o ’ thought Christ went agin war an ’ pillage . ”</p>
     <p>‘ If the Post maintains the converse of this proposition , it can hardly be considered as a safe guide-post for the moral and religious portions of its party , however many other excellent qualities of a post it may be blessed with . There is a sign in London on which is painted ,— “ The Green Man . ” It would do very well as a portrait of any individual who should support so unscriptural a thesis . As regards the language of the line in question , I am bold to say that He who readeth the hearts of men will not account any dialect unseemly which conveys a sound , and pious sentiment . I could wish that such sentiments were more common , however uncouthly expressed . Saint Ambrose affirms , that veritas a quocunque ( why not , then , quomodocunque ? ) dicatur , a , spiritu sancto est . Digest also this of Baxter : “ The plainest words are the most profitable oratory in the weightiest matters . ”</p>
     <p>‘ When the paragraph in question was shown to Mr. Biglow , the only part of it which seemed to give him any dissatisfaction was that which classed him with the Whig party . He says , that , if resolutions are a nourishing kind of diet , that party must be in a very hearty and flourishing condition ; for that they have quietly eaten more good ones of their own baking than he could have conceived to be possible without repletion . He has been for some years past ( I regret to say ) an ardent opponent of those sound doctrines of protective policy which form so prominent a portion of the creed of that party . I confess , that , in some discussions which I have had with him on this point in my study , he has displayed a vein of obstinacy which I had not hitherto detected in his composition . He is also ( horresco referens ) infected in no small measure with the peculiar notions of a print called the Liberator , whose heresies I take every proper opportunity of combating , and of which , I thank God , I have never read a single line .</p>
     <p>‘ I did not see Mr . B . ' s verses until they appeared in print , and there is certainly one thing in them which I consider highly improper . I allude to the personal references to myself by name . To confer notoriety on an humble individual who is laboring quietly in his vocation , and who keeps his cloth as free as he can from the dust of the political arena ( though voe mihi si non evangelizavero ) , is no doubt an indecorum . The sentiments which he attributes to me I will not deny to be mine . They were embodied , though in a different form , in a discourse preached upon the last day of public fasting , and were acceptable to my entire people ( of whatever political views ) , except the postmaster , who dissented ex officio . I observe that you sometimes devote a portion of your paper to a religious summary . I should be well pleased to furnish a copy of my discourse for insertion in this department of your instructive journal . By omitting the advertisements , it might easily be got within the limits of a single number , and I venture to insure you the sale of some scores of copies in this town . I will cheerfully render myself responsible for ten . It might possibly be advantageous to issue it as an extra . But perhaps you will not esteem it an object , and I will not press it . My offer does not spring from any weak desire of seeing my name in print ; for I can enjoy this satisfaction at any time by turning to the Triennial Catalogue of the University , where it also possesses that added emphasis of Italics with which those of my calling are distinguished .</p>
     <p>‘ I would simply add , that I continue to fit ingenuous youth for college , and that I have two spacious and airy sleeping apartments at this moment unoccupied . Ingenuas didicisse , &amp; c. Terms , which vary according to the circumstances of the parents , may be known on application to me by letter , post-paid . In all cases the lad will be expected to fetch his own towels . This rule , Mrs. W. desires me to add , has no exceptions .</p>
     <p>‘ Respectfully , your obedient servant ,</p>
     <p>‘ HOMER WILBUR , A. M .</p>
     <p>‘ P. S . Perhaps the last paragraph may look like an attempt to obtain the insertion of my circular gratuitously . If it should appear to you in that light , I desire that you would erase it , or charge for it at the usual rates , and deduct the amount from the proceeds in your hands from the sale of my discourse , when it shall be printed . My circular is much longer and more explicit , and will be forwarded without charge to any who may desire it . It has been very neatly executed on a letter sheet , by a very deserving printer , who attends upon my ministry , and is a creditable specimen of the typographic art . I have one hung over my mantelpiece in a neat frame , where it makes a beautiful and appropriate ornament , and balances the profile of Mrs. W ., cut with her toes by the young lady born without arms .</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>‘ H. W . ’</head>
      <head>I have in the foregoing letter mentioned General Scott in connection with the Presidency , because I have been given to understand that he has blown to pieces and otherwise caused to be destroyed more Mexicans than any other commander . His claim would therefore be deservedly considered the strongest . Until accurate returns of the Mexicans killed , wounded , and maimed be obtained , it will be difficult to settle these nice points of precedence . Should it prove that any other officer has been more meritorious and destructive than General S ., and has thereby rendered himself more worthy of the confidence and support of the conservative portion of our community , I shall cheerfully insert his name , instead of that of General S ., in a future edition . It may be thought , likewise , that General S. has invalidated his claims by too much attention to the decencies of apparel , and the habits belonging to a gentleman . These abstruser points of statesmanship are beyond my scope . I wonder not that successful military achievement should attract the admiration of the multitude . Rather do I rejoice with wonder to behold how rapidly this sentiment is losing its hold upon the popular mind . It is related of Thomas Warton , the second of that honored name who held the office of Poetry Professor at Oxford , that , when one wished to find him , being absconded , as was his wont , in some obscure alehouse , he was counselled to traverse the city with a drum and fife , the sound of which inspiring music would be sure to draw the Doctor from his retirement into the street . We are all more or less bitten with this martial insanity . Nescio qua dulcedine ... cunctos ducit . I confess to some infection of that itch myself . When I see a Brigadier-General maintaining his insecure elevation in the saddle under the severe fire of the training-field , and when I remember that some military enthusiasts , through haste , inexperience , or an over-desire to lend reality to those fictitious combats , will sometimes discharge their ramrods , I cannot but admire , while I deplore , the mistaken devotion of those heroic officers . Semel insanivimus omnes . I was myself , during the late war with Great Britain , chaplain of a regiment , which was fortunately never called to active military duty . I mention this circumstance with regret rather than pride . Had I been summoned to actual warfare , I trust that I might have been strengthened to bear myself after the manner of that reverend father in our New England Israel , Dr. Benjamin Colman , who , as we are told in Turell 's life of him , when the vessel in which he had taken passage for England was attacked by a French privateer , ‘ fought like a philosopher and a Christian , ... and prayed all the while he charged and fired . ’ As this note is already long , I shall not here enter upon a discussion of the question , whether Christians may lawfully be soldiers . I think it sufficiently evident , that , during the first two centuries of the Christian era , at least , the two professions were esteemed incompatible . Consult Jortin on this head ,— H.

      <head>REMARKS OF INCREASE D. O'PHACE , ESQUIRE ,</head>
      <head>AT AN EXTRUMPERY CAUCUS IN STATE STREET , REPORTED BY MR. H. BIGLOW</head>
      <head>[ The ingenious reader will at once understand that no such speech as the following was ever totidem verbis pronounced . But there are simpler and less guarded wits , for the satisfying of which such an explanation may be needful . For there are certain invisible lines , which as Truth successively overpasses , she becomes Untruth to one and another of us , as a large river , flowing from one kingdom into another , sometimes takes a new name , albeit the waters undergo no change , how small soever . There is , moreover , a truth of fiction more veracious than the truth of fact , as that of the Poet , which represents to us things and events as they ought to be , rather than servilely copies them as they are imperfectly imaged in the crooked and smoky glass of our mundane affairs . It is this which makes the speech of Antonius , though originally spoken in no wider a forum than the brain of Shakespeare , more historically valuable than that other which Appian has reported , by as much as the understanding of the Englishman was more comprehensive than that of the Alexandrian . Mr. Biglow , in the present instance , has only made use of a license assumed by all the historians of antiquity , who put into the mouths of various characters such words as seem to them most fitting to the occasion and to the speaker . If it be objected that no such oration could ever have been delivered , I answer , that there are few assemblages for speech-making which do not better deserve the title of Parliamentum Indoctorum than did the sixth Parliament of Henry the Fourth , and that men still continue to have as much faith in the Oracle of Fools as ever Pantagruel had . Howell , in his letters , recounts a merry tale of a certain ambassador of Queen Elizabeth , who , having written two letters ,— one to her Majesty , and the other to his wife ,— directed them at cross-purposes , so that the Queen was beducked and bedeared and requested to send a change of hose , and the wife was beprincessed and otherwise unwontedly besuperlatived , till the one feared for the wits of her ambassador , and the other for those of her husband . In like manner it may be presumed that our speaker has misdirected some of his thoughts , and given to the whole theatre what he would have wished to confide only to a select auditory at the back of the curtain . For it is seldom that we can get any frank utterance from men , who address , for the most part , a Buncombe either in this world or the next . As for their audiences , it may be truly said of our people , that they enjoy one political institution in common with the ancient Athenians : I mean a certain profitless kind of , ostracism , wherewith , nevertheless , they seem hitherto well enough content . For in Presidential elections , and other affairs of the sort , whereas I observe that the oysters fall to the lot of comparatively few , the shells ( such as the privileges of voting as they are told to do by the ostrivori aforesaid , and of huzzaing at public meetings ) are very liberally distributed among the people , as being their prescriptive and quite sufficient portion .</head>

     <p>[ Into the question whether the ability to express ourselves in articulate language has been productive of more good or evil , I shall not here enter at large . The two faculties of speech and of speech-making are wholly diverse in their natures . By the first we make ourselves intelligible , by the last unintelligible , to our fellows . It has not seldom occurred to me ( noting how in our national legislature everything runs to talk , as lettuces , if the season or the soil be unpropitious , shoot up lankly to seed , instead of forming handsome heads ) that Babel was the first Congress , the earliest mill erected for the manufacture of gabble . In these days , what with Town Meetings , School Committees , Boards ( lumber ) of one kind and another , Congresses , Parliaments , Diets , Indian Councils , Palavers , and the like , there is scarce a village which has not its factories of this description driven by milk-and-water power . I cannot conceive the confusion of tongues to have been the curse of Babel , since I esteem my ignorance of other languages as a kind of Martello-tower , in which I am safe from the furious bombardments of foreign garrulity . For this reason I have ever preferred the study of the dead languages , those primitive formations being Ararats upon whose silent peaks I sit secure and watch this new deluge without fear , though it rain figures ( simulacra , semblances ) of speech forty days and nights together , as it not uncommonly happens . Thus is my coat , as it were , without buttons by which any but a vernacular wild bore can seize me . Is it not possible that the Shakers may intend to convey a quiet reproof and hint , in fastening their outer garments with hooks and eyes ?</p>
     <p>This reflection concerning Babel , which I find in no Commentary , was first thrown upon my mind when an excellent deacon of my congregation ( being infected with the Second Advent delusion ) assured me that he had received a first instalment of the gift of tongues as a small earnest of larger possessions in the like kind to follow . For , of a truth , I could not reconcile it with my ideas of the Divine justice and mercy that the single wall which protected people of other languages from the incursions of this otherwise well-meaning propagandist should be broken down .</p>
     <p>In reading Congressional debates , I have fancied , that , after the subsidence of those painful buzzings in the brain which result from such exercises , I detected a slender residuum of valuable information . I made the discovery that nothing takes longer in the saying than anything else , for as ex nihilo nihil fit , so from one polypus nothing any number of similar ones may be produced . I would recommend to the attention of viva voce debaters and controversialists the admirable example of the monk Copres , who , in the fourth century , stood for half an hour in the midst of a great fire , and thereby silenced a Manichæan antagonist who had less of the salamander in him . As for those who quarrel in print , I have no concern with them here , since the eyelids are a divinely granted shield against all such . Moreover , I have observed in many modern books that the printed portion is becoming gradually smaller , and the number of blank or fly-leaves ( as they are called ) greater . Should this fortunate tendency of literature continue , books will grow more valuable from year to year , and the whole Serbonian bog yield to the advances of firm arable land .</p>
     <p>The sagacious Lacedæmonians , hearing that Tesephone had bragged that he could talk all day long on any given subject , made no more ado , but forthwith banished him , whereby they supplied him a topic and at the same time took care that his experiment upon it should be tried out of earshot .</p>
     <p>I have wondered , in the Representatives ’ Chamber of our own Commonwealth , to mark how little impression seemed to be produced by that emblematic fish suspended over the heads of the members . Our wiser ancestors , no doubt , hung it there as being the animal which the Pythagoreans reverenced for its silence , and which certainly in that particular does not so well merit the epithet cold blooded , by which naturalists distinguish it , as certain bipeds , afflicted with ditch-water on the brain , who take occasion to tap themselves in Faneuil Halls , meeting-houses , and other places of public resort .— H.

     <p>THE DEBATE IN THE SENNIT</p>
     <p>SOT TO A NUSRY RHYME</p>
     <p>[ The incident which gave rise to the debate satirized in the following verses was the unsuccessful attempt of Drayton and Sayres to give freedom to seventy men and women , fellow-beings and fellow-Christians . Had Tripoli , instead of Washington , been the scene of this undertaking , the unhappy leaders in it would have been as secure of the theoretic as they now are of the practical part of martyrdom . I question whether the Dey of Tripoli is blessed with a District Attorney so benighted as ours at the seat of government . Very fitly is he named Key , who would allow himself to be made the instrument of locking the door of hope against sufferers in such a cause . Not all the waters of the ocean can cleanse the vile smutch of the jailer 's fingers from off that little Key . Ahenea clavis , a brazen Key indeed !</p>
     <p>Mr. Calhoun , who is made the chief speaker in this burlesque , seems to think that the light of the nineteenth century is to be put out as soon as he tinkles his little cow-bell curfew . Whenever slavery is touched , he sets up his scarecrow of dissolving the Union . This may do for the North , but I should conjecture that something more than a pumpkin-lantern is required to scare manifest and irretrievable Destiny out of her path . Mr. Calhoun cannot let go the apron-string of the Past . The Past is a good nurse , but we must be weaned from her sooner or later , even though , like Plotinus , we should run home from school to ask the breast , after we are tolerably well-grown youths . It will not do for us to hide our faces in her lap , whenever the strange Future holds out her arms and asks us to come to her .</p>
     <p>But we are all alike . We have all heard it said , often enough , that little boys must not play with fire ; and yet , if the matches be taken away from us , and put out of reach upon the shelf , we must needs get into our little corner , and scowl and stamp and threaten the dire revenge of going to bed without our supper . The world shall stop till we get our dangerous plaything again . Dame Earth , meanwhile , who has more than enough household matters to mind , goes bustling hither and thither as a hiss or a sputter tells her that this or that kettle of hers is boiling over , and before bedtime we are glad to eat our porridge cold , and gulp down our dignity along with it .</p>
     <p>Mr. Calhoun has somehow acquired the name of a great statesman , and , if it be great statesmanship to put lance in rest and run a tilt at the Spirit of the Age with the certainty of being next moment hurled neck and heels into the dust amid universal laughter , he deserves the title . He is the Sir Kay of our modern chivalry . He should remember the old Scandinavian mythus . Thor was the strongest of gods , but he could not wrestle with Time , nor so much as lift up a fold of the great snake which bound the universe together ; and when he smote the Earth , though with his terrible mallet , it was but as if a leaf had fallen . Yet all the while it seemed to Thor that he had only been wrestling with an old woman , striving to lift a cat , and striking a stupid giant on the head .</p>
     <p>And in old times , doubtless , the giants were stupid , and there was no better sport for the Sir Launcelots and Sir Gawains than to go about cutting off their great blundering heads with enchanted swords . But things have wonderfully changed . It is the giants , nowadays , that have the science and the intelligence , while the chivalrous Don Quixotes of Conservatism still cumber themselves with the clumsy armor of a bygone age . On whirls the restless globe through unsounded time , with its cities and its silences , its births and funerals , half light , half shade , but never wholly dark , and sure to swing round into the happy morning at last . With an involuntary smile , one sees Mr. Calhoun letting slip his pack-thread cable with a crooked pin at the end of it to anchor South Carolina upon the bank and shoal of the Past .— H. W . ]</p>

     <p>[ It was said of old time , that riches have wings ; and , though this be not applicable in a literal strictness to the wealth of our patriarchal brethren of the South , yet it is clear that their possessions have legs , and an unaccountable propensity for using them in a northerly direction . I marvel that the grand jury of Washington did not find a true bill against the North Star for aiding and abetting Drayton and Sayres . It would have been quite of a piece with the intelligence displayed by the South on other questions connected with slavery . I think that no ship of state was ever freighted with a more veritable Jonah than this same domestic institution of ours . Mephistopheles himself could not feign so bitterly , so satirically sad a sight as this of three millions of human beings crushed beyond help or hope by this one mighty argument ,— Our fathers knew no better ! Nevertheless , it is the unavoidable destiny of Jonahs to be cast overboard sooner or later . Or shall we try the experiment of hiding our Jonah in a safe place , that none may lay hands on him to make jetsam of him ? Let us , then , with equal forethought and wisdom , lash ourselves to the anchor , and await , in pious confidence , the certain result . Perhaps our suspicious passenger is no Jonah after all , being black . For it is well known that a superintending Providence made a kind of sandwich of Ham and his descendants , to be devoured by the Caucasian race .</p>
     <p>In God 's name , let all , who hear nearer and nearer the hungry moan of the storm and the growl of the breakers , speak out ! But , alas ! we have no right to interfere . If a man pluck an apple of mine , he shall be in danger of the justice ; but if he steal my brother , I must be silent . Who says this ? Our Constitution , consecrated by the callous consuetude of sixty years , and grasped in triumphant argument by the left hand of him whose right hand clutches the clotted slave-whip . Justice , venerable with the undethronable majesty of countless æons , says ,— SPEAK ! The Past , wise with the sorrows and desolations of ages , from amid her shattered fanes and wolf-housing palaces , echoes ,— SPEAK ! Nature , through her thousand trumpets of freedom , her stars , her sunrises , her seas , her winds , her cataracts , her mountains blue with cloudy pines , blows jubilant encouragement , and cries ,— SPEAK ! From the soul 's trembling abysses the still , small voice not vaguely murmurs ,— SPEAK ! But , alas ! the Constitution and the Honorable Mr. Bagowind , M. C ., say — BE DUMB !</p>
     <p>It occurs to me to suggest , as a topic of inquiry in this connection , whether , on that momentous occasion when the goats and the sheep shall be parted , the Constitution and the Honorable Mr. Bagowind , M. C ., will be expected to take their places on the left as our hircine vicars .</p>
     <p>Quid sum miser tunc dicturus ? Quem patronum rogaturus ?</p>
     <p>There is a point where toleration sinks into sheer baseness and poltroonery . The toleration of the worst leads us to look on what is barely better as good enough , and to worship what is only moderately good . Woe to that man , or that nation , to whom mediocrity has become an ideal !</p>
     <p>Has our experiment of self-government succeeded , if it barely manage to rub and go ? Here , now , is a piece of barbarism which Christ and the nineteenth century say shall cease , and which Messrs. Smith , Brown , and others say shall not cease . I would by no means deny the eminent respectability of these gentlemen , but I confess , that , in such a wrestling match , I cannot help having my fears for them .</p>

     <p>THE PIOUS EDITOR 'S CREED</p>
     <p>[ At the special instance of Mr. Biglow , I preface the following satire with an extract from a sermon preached during the past summer , from Ezekiel xxxiv . 2 : ‘ Son of man , prophesy against the shepherds of Israel . ’ Since the Sabbath on which this discourse was delivered , the editor of the ‘ Jaalam Independent Blunderbuss ’ has unaccountably absented himself from our house of worship .</p>
     <p>‘ I know of no so responsible position as that of the public journalist . The editor of our day bears the same relation to his time that the clerk bore to the age before the invention of printing . Indeed , the position which he holds is that which the clergyman should hold even now . But the clergyman chooses to walk off to the extreme edge of the world , and to throw such seed as he has clear over into that darkness which he calls the Next Life . As if next did not mean nearest , and as if any life were nearer than that immediately present one which boils and eddies all around him at the caucus , the ratification meeting , and the polls ! Who taught him to exhort men to prepare for eternity , as for some future era of which the present forms no integral part ? The furrow which Time is even now turning runs through the Everlasting , and in that must he plant , or nowhere . Yet he would fain believe and teach that we are going to have more of eternity than we have now . This going of his is like that of the auctioneer , on which gone follows before we have made up our minds to bid ,— in which manner , not three months back , I lost an excellent copy of Chappelow on Job . So it has come to pass that the preacher , instead of being a living force , has faded into an emblematic figure at christenings , weddings , and funerals . Or , if he exercise any other function , it is as keeper and feeder of certain theologic dogmas , which , when occasion offers , he unkennels with a staboy ! “ to bark and bite as ‘ tis their nature to , ” whence that reproach of odium theologicum has arisen .</p>
     <p>‘ Meanwhile , see what a pulpit the editor mounts daily , sometimes with a congregation of fifty thousand within reach of his voice , and never so much as a nodder , even , among them ! And from what a Bible can he choose his text ,— a Bible which needs no translation , and which no priestcraft can shut and clasp from the laity ,— the open volume of the world , upon which , with a pen of sunshine or destroying fire , the inspired Present is even now writing the annals of God ! Methinks the editor who should understand his calling , and be equal thereto , would truly deserve that title of [ Greek : poimaen laon ] , which Homer bestows upon princes . He would be the Moses of our nineteenth century ; and whereas the old Sinai , silent now , is but a common mountain stared at by the elegant tourist and crawled over by the hammering geologist , he must find his tables of the new law here among factories and cities in this Wilderness of Sin ( Numbers xxxiii . 12 ) called Progress of Civilization , and be the captain of our Exodus into the Canaan of a truer social order .</p>
     <p>‘ Nevertheless , our editor will not come so far within even the shadow of Sinai as Mahomet did , but chooses rather to construe Moses by Joe Smith . He takes up the crook , not that the sheep may be fed , but that he may never want a warm woollen suit and a joint of mutton .</p>
     <p>Immemor , O , fidei , pecorumque oblite tuorum !</p>
     <p>For which reason I would derive the name editor not so much from edo , to publish , as from edo , to eat , that being the peculiar profession to which he esteems himself called . He blows up the flames of political discord for no other occasion than that he may thereby handily boil his own pot . I believe there are two thousand of these mutton-loving shepherds in the United States , and of these , how many have even the dimmest perception of their immense power , and the duties consequent thereon ? Here and there , haply , one . Nine hundred and ninety-nine labor to impress upon the people the great principles of Tweedledum , and other nine hundred and ninety-nine preach with equal earnestness the gospel according to Tweedledee . ’ — H. W . ]</p>

       <l n="105">[ I subjoin here another passage from my before-mentioned discourse .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>‘ Wonderful , to him that has eyes to see it rightly , is the newspaper . To me , for example , sitting on the critical front bench of the pit , in my study here in Jaalam , the advent of my weekly journal is as that of a strolling theatre , or rather of a puppet-show , on whose stage , narrow as it is , the tragedy , comedy , and farce of life are played in little . Behold the whole huge earth sent to me hebdomadally in a brown-paper wrapper !</p>
     <p>‘ Hither , to my obscure corner , by wind or steam , on horseback or dromedary-back , in the pouch of the Indian runner , or clicking over the magnetic wires , troop all the famous performers from the four quarters of the globe . Looked at from a point of criticism , tiny puppets they seem all , as the editor sets up his booth upon my desk and officiates as showman . Now I can truly see how little and transitory is life . The earth appears almost as a drop of vinegar , on which the solar microscope of the imagination must be brought to bear in order to make out anything distinctly . That animalcule there , in the pea-jacket , is Louis Philippe , just landed on the coast of England . That other , in the gray surtout and cocked hat , is Napoleon Bonaparte Smith , assuring France that she need apprehend no interference from him in the present alarming juncture . At that spot , where you seem to see a speck of something in motion , is an immense mass-meeting . Look sharper , and you will see a mite brandishing his mandibles in an excited manner . That is the great Mr. Soandso , defining his position amid tumultuous and irrepressible cheers . That infinitesimal creature , upon whom some score of others , as minute as he , are gazing in open-mouthed admiration , is a famous philosopher , expounding to a select audience their capacity for the Infinite . That scarce discernible pufflet of smoke and dust is a revolution . That speck there is a reformer , just arranging the lever with which he is to move the world . And lo , there creeps forward the shadow of a skeleton that blows one breath between its grinning teeth , and all our distinguished actors are whisked off the slippery stage into the dark Beyond .</p>
     <p>‘ Yes , the little show-box has its solemner suggestions . Now and then we catch a glimpse of a grim old man , who lays down a scythe and hour-glass in the corner while he shifts the scenes . There , too , in the dim background , a weird shape is ever delving . Sometimes he leans upon his mattock , and gazes , as a coach whirls by , bearing the newly married on their wedding jaunt , or glances carelessly at a babe brought home from christening . Suddenly ( for the scene grows larger and larger as we look ) a bony hand snatches back a performer in the midst of his part , and him , whom yesterday two infinities ( past and future ) would not suffice , a handful of dust is enough to cover and silence forever . Nay , we see the same fleshless fingers opening to clutch the showman himself , and guess , not without a shudder , that they are lying in wait for spectator also .</p>
     <p>‘ Think of it : for three dollars a year I buy a season-ticket to this great Globe Theatre , for which God would write the dramas ( only that we like farces , spectacles , and the tragedies of Apollyon better ) , whose scene-shifter is Time , and whose curtain is rung down by Death .</p>
     <p>‘ Such thoughts will occur to me sometimes as I am tearing off the wrapper of my newspaper . Then suddenly that otherwise too often vacant sheet becomes invested for me with a strange kind of awe . Look ! deaths and marriages , notices of inventions , discoveries , and books , lists of promotions , of killed , wounded , and missing , news of fires , accidents , of sudden wealth and as sudden poverty ;— I hold in my hand the ends of myriad invisible electric conductors , along which tremble the joys , sorrows , wrongs , triumphs , hopes , and despairs of as many men and women everywhere . So that upon that mood of mind which seems to isolate me from mankind as a spectator of their puppet-pranks , another supervenes , in which I feel that I , too , unknown and unheard of , am yet of some import to my fellows . For , through my newspaper here , do not families take pains to send me , an entire stranger , news of a death among them ? Are not here two who would have me know of their marriage ? And , strangest of all , is not this singular person anxious to have me informed that he has received a fresh supply of Dimitry Bruisgins ? But to none of us does the Present continue miraculous ( even if for a moment discerned as such ) . We glance carelessly at the sunrise , and get used to Orion and the Pleiades . The wonder wears off , and to-morrow this sheet , ( Acts x . 11 , 12 ) in which a vision was let down to me from Heaven , shall be the wrappage to a bar of soap or the platter for a beggar 's broken victuals . ’ — H. W . ]</p>

     <p>A LETTER</p>
     <p>FROM A CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY IN ANSWER TO SUTTIN QUESTIONS PROPOSED BY MR. HOSEA BIGLOW , INCLOSED IN A NOTE FROM MR. BIGLOW TO S. H . GAY , ESQ ., EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD</p>
     <p>[ Curiosity may be said to be the quality which preeminently distinguishes and segregates man from the lower animals . As we trace the scale of animated nature downward , we find this faculty ( as it may truly he called ) of the mind diminished in the savage , and wellnigh extinct in the brute . The first object which civilized man proposes to himself I take to be the finding out whatsoever he can concerning his neighbors . Nihil humanum a me alienum puto ; I am curious about even John Smith . The desire next in strength to this ( an opposite pole , indeed , of the same magnet ) is that of communicating the unintelligence we have carefully picked up .</p>
     <p>Men in general may be divided into the inquisitive and the communicative . To the first class belong Peeping Toms , eaves-droppers , navel-contemplating Brahmins , metaphysicians , travellers , Empedocleses , spies , the various societies for promoting Rhinothism , Columbuses , Yankees , discoverers , and men of science , who present themselves to the mind as so many marks of interrogation wandering up and down the world , or sitting in studies and laboratories . The second class I should again subdivide into four . In the first subdivision I would rank those who have an itch to tell us about themselves ,— as keepers of diaries , insignificant persons generally , Montaignes , Horace Walpoles , autobiographers , poets . The second includes those who are anxious to impart information concerning other people ,— as historians , barbers , and such . To the third belong those who labor to give us intelligence about nothing at all ,— as novelists , political orators , the large majority of authors , preachers , lecturers , and the like . In the fourth come those who are communicative from motives of public benevolence ,— as finders of mares ’ - nests and bringers of ill news . Each of us two-legged fowls without feathers embraces all these subdivisions in himself to a greater or less degree , for none of us so much as lays an egg , or incubates a chalk one , but straightway the whole barnyard shall know it by our cackle or our cluck . Omnibus hoc vitium est . There are different grades in all these classes . One will turn his telescope toward a back-yard , another toward Uranus ; one will tell you that he dined with Smith , another that he supped with Plato . In one particular , all men may be considered as belonging to the first grand division , inasmuch as they all seem equally desirous of discovering the mote in their neighbor 's eye .</p>
     <p>To one or another of these species every human being may safely be referred . I think it beyond a peradventure that Jonah prosecuted some inquiries into the digestive apparatus of whales , and that Noah sealed up a letter in an empty bottle , that news in regard to him might not be wanting in case of the worst . They had else been super or subter human . I conceive , also , that , as there are certain persons who continually peep and pry at the keyhole of that mysterious door through which , sooner or later , we all make our exits , so there are doubtless ghosts fidgeting and fretting on the other side of it , because they have no means of conveying back to this world the scraps of news they have picked up in that . For there is an answer ready somewhere to every question , the great law of give and take runs through all nature , and if we see a hook , we may be sure that an eye is waiting for it . I read in every face I meet a standing advertisement of information wanted in regard to A. B ., or that the friends of C. D . can hear something to his disadvantage by application to such a one .</p>
     <p>It was to gratify the two great passions of asking and answering that epistolary correspondence was first invented . Letters ( for by this usurped title epistles are now commonly known ) are of several kinds . First , there are those which are not letters at all — as letters-patent , letters dismissory , letters enclosing bills , letters of administration , Pliny 's letters , letters of diplomacy , of Cato , of Mentor , of Lords Lyttelton , Chesterfield , and Orrery , of Jacob Behmen , Seneca ( whom St. Jerome includes in his list of sacred writers ) , letters from abroad , from sons in college to their fathers , letters of marque , and letters generally , which are in no wise letters of mark . Second , are real letters , such as those of Gray , Cowper , Walpole , Howell , Lamb , D. Y ., the first letters from children ( printed in staggering capitals ) , Letters from New York , letters of credit , and others , interesting for the sake of the writer or the thing written . I have read also letters from Europe by a gentleman named Pinto , containing some curious gossip , and which I hope to see collected for the benefit of the curious . There are , besides , letters addressed to posterity ,— as epitaphs , for example , written for their own monuments by monarchs , whereby we have lately become possessed of the names of several great conquerors and kings of kings , hitherto unheard of and still unpronounceable , but valuable to the student of the entirely dark ages . The letter of our Saviour to King Abgarus , that which St. Peter sent to King Pepin in the year of grace 755 , that of the Virgin to the magistrates of Messina , that of the Sanhedrim of Toledo to Annas and Caiaphas , A. D. 35 , that of Galeazzo Sforza 's spirit to his brother Lodovico , that of St. Gregory Thaumaturgus to the D —— l , and that of this last-mentioned active police-magistrate to a nun of Girgenti , I would place in a class by themselves , as also the letters of candidates , concerning which I shall dilate more fully in a note at the end of the following poem . At present sat prata biberunt . Only , concerning the shape of letters , they are all either square or oblong , to which general figures circular letters and round-robins also conform themselves .— H. W . ]</p>
     <p>Deer Sir its gut to be the fashun now to rite letters to the candid 8s and i wus chose at a publick Meetin in Jaalam to du wut wus nessary fur that town . i writ to 271 ginerals and gut ansers to 209. tha air called candid 8s but I do n't see nothin candid about ‘ em . this here 1 wich I send wus thought satty 's factory . I dunno as it 's ushle to print Poscrips , but as all the ansers I got hed the saim , I sposed it wus best . times has gretly changed . Formaly to knock a man into a cocked hat wus to use him up , but now it ony gives him a chance fur the cheef madgustracy .— H. B .</p>

     <p>[ And now of epistles candidatial , which are of two kinds ,— namely , letters of acceptance , and letters definitive of position . Our republic , on the eve of an election , may safely enough be called a republic of letters . Epistolary composition becomes then an epidemic , which seizes one candidate after another , not seldom cutting short the thread of political life . It has come to such a pass , that a party dreads less the attacks of its opponents than a letter from its candidate . Litera scripta manet , and it will go hard if something bad cannot be made of it . General Harrison , it is well understood , was surrounded , during his candidacy , with the cordon sanitaire of a vigilance committee . No prisoner in Spielberg was ever more cautiously deprived of writing materials . The soot was scraped carefully from the chimney-places ; outposts of expert rifle-shooters rendered it sure death for any goose ( who came clad in feathers ) to approach within a certain limited distance of North Bend ; and all domestic fowls about the premises were reduced to the condition of Plato 's original man . By these precautions the General was saved . Parva componere magnis , I remember , that , when party-spirit once ran high among my people , upon occasion of the choice of a new deacon , I , having my preferences , yet not caring too openly to express them , made use of an innocent fraud to bring about that result which I deemed most desirable . My stratagem was no other than the throwing a copy of the Complete Letter-Writer in the way of the candidate whom I wished to defeat . He caught the infection , and addressed a short note to his constituents , in which the opposite party detected so many and so grave improprieties ( he had modelled it upon the letter of a young lady accepting a proposal of marriage ) , that he not only lost his election , but , falling under a suspicion of Sabellianism and I know not what ( the widow Endive assured me that he was a Paralipomenon , to her certain knowledge ) , was forced to leave the town . Thus it is that the letter killeth .</p>
     <p>The object which candidates propose to themselves in writing is to convey no meaning at all . And here is a quite unsuspected pitfall into which they successively plunge headlong . For it is precisely in such cryptographies that mankind are prone to seek for and find a wonderful amount and variety of significance . Omne ignotum pro mirifico . How do we admire at the antique world striving to crack those oracular nuts from Delphi , Hammon , and elsewhere , in only one of which can I so much as surmise that any kernel had ever lodged ; that , namely , wherein Apollo confessed that he was mortal . One Didymus is , moreover , related to have written six thousand books on the single subject of grammar , a topic rendered only more tenebrific by the labors of his successors , and which seems still to possess an attraction for authors in proportion as they can make nothing of it . A singular loadstone for theologians , also , is the Beast in the Apocalypse , whereof , in the course of my studies , I have noted two hundred and three several interpretations , each lethiferal to all the rest . Non nostrum est tantas componere lites , yet I have myself ventured upon a two hundred and fourth , which I embodied in a discourse preached on occasion of the demise of the late usurper , Napoleon Bonaparte , and which quieted , in a large measure , the minds of my people . It is true that my views on this important point were ardently controverted by Mr. Shearjashub Holden , the then preceptor of our academy , and in other particulars a very deserving and sensible young man , though possessing a somewhat limited knowledge of the Greek tongue . But his heresy struck down no deep root , and , he having been lately removed by the hand of Providence , I had the satisfaction of reaffirming my cherished sentiments in a sermon preached upon the Lord 's day immediately succeeding his funeral . This might seem like taking an unfair advantage , did I not add that he had made provision in his last will ( being celibate ) for the publication of a posthumous tractate in support of his own dangerous opinions .</p>
     <p>I know of nothing in our modern times which approaches so nearly to the ancient oracle as the letter of a Presidential candidate . Now , among the Greeks , the eating of beans was strictly forbidden to all such as had it in mind to consult those expert amphibologists , and this same prohibition on the part of Pythagoras to his disciples is understood to imply an abstinence from politics , beans having been used as ballots . That other explication , quod videlicet sensus eo cibo obtundi existimaret , though supported pugnis et calcibus by many of the learned , and not wanting the countenance of Cicero , is confuted by the larger experience of New England . On the whole , I think it safer to apply here the rule of interpretation which now generally obtains in regard to antique cosmogonies , myths , fables , proverbial expressions , and knotty points generally , which is , to find a common-sense meaning , and then select whatever can be imagined the most opposite thereto . In this way we arrive at the conclusion , that the Greeks objected to the questioning of candidates . And very properly , if , as I conceive , the chief point be not to discover what a person in that position is , or what he will do , but whether he can be elected . Vos exemplaria Græca nocturna versate manu , versate diurna .</p>
     <p>But , since an imitation of the Greeks in this particular ( the asking of questions being one chief privilege of freemen ) is hardly to be hoped for , and our candidates will answer , whether they are questioned or not , I would recommend that these ante-electionary dialogues should be carried on by symbols , as were the diplomatic correspondences of the Scythians an Macrobii , or confined to the language of signs , like the famous interview of Panurge and Goatsnose . A candidate might then convey a suitable reply to all committees of inquiry by closing one eye , or by presenting them with a phial of Egyptian darkness to be speculated upon by their respective constituencies . These answers would be susceptible of whatever retrospective construction the exigencies of the political campaign might seem to demand , and the candidate could take his position on either side of the fence with entire consistency . Or , if letters must be written , profitable use might be made of the Dighton rock hieroglyphic or the cuneiform script , every fresh decipherer of which is enabled to educe a different meaning , whereby a sculptured stone or two supplies us , and will probably continue to supply posterity , with a very vast and various body of authentic history . For even the briefest epistle in the ordinary chirography is dangerous . There is scarce any style so compressed that superfluous words may not be detected in it . A severe critic might curtail that famous brevity of Cæsar 's by two thirds , drawing his pen through the supererogatory veni and vidi . Perhaps , after all , the surest footing of hope is to be found in the rapidly increasing tendency to demand less and less of qualification in candidates . Already have statesmanship , experience , and the possession ( nay , the profession , even ) of principles been rejected as superfluous , and may not the patriot reasonably hope that the ability to write will follow ? At present , there may be death in pothooks as well as pots , the loop of a letter may suffice for a bowstring , and all the dreadful heresies of Antislavery may lurk in a flourish .— H. W . ]</p>

     <p>A SECOND LETTER FROM B. SAWIN , ESQ .</p>
     <p>[ In the following epistle , we behold Mr. Sawin returning , a miles emeritus , to the bosom of his family . Quantum mutatus ! The good Father of us all had doubtless intrusted to the keeping of this child of his certain faculties of a constructive kind . He had put in him a share of that vital force , the nicest economy of every minute atom of which is necessary to the perfect development of Humanity . He had given him a brain and heart , and so had equipped his soul with the two strong wings of knowledge and love , whereby it can mount to hang its nest under the eaves of heaven . And this child , so dowered , he had intrusted to the keeping of his vicar , the State . How stands the account of that stewardship ? The State , or Society ( call her by what name you will ) , had taken no manner of thought of him till she saw him swept out into the street , the pitiful leavings of last night 's debauch , with cigar-ends , lemon-parings , tobacco-quids , slops , vile stenches , and the whole loathsome next-morning of the bar-room ,— an own child of the Almighty God ! I remember him as he was brought to be christened , a ruddy , rugged babe ; and now there he wallows , reeking , seething ,— the dead corpse , not of a man , but of a soul ,— a putrefying lump , horrible for the life that is in it . Comes the wind of heaven , that good Samaritan , and parts the hair upon his forehead , nor is too nice to kiss those parched , cracked lips ; the morning opens upon him her eyes full of pitying sunshine , the sky yearns down to him ,— and there he lies fermenting . O sleep ! let me not profane thy holy name by calling that stertorous unconsciousness a slumber ! By and by comes along the State , God 's vicar . Does she say , ‘ My poor , forlorn foster-child ! Behold here a force which I will make dig and plant and build for me ’ ? Not so , but , ‘ Here is a recruit ready-made to my hand , a piece of destroying energy lying unprofitably idle . ’ So she claps an ugly gray suit on him , puts a musket in his grasp , and sends him off , with Gubernatorial and other godspeeds , to do duty as a destroyer .</p>
     <p>I made one of the crowd at the last Mechanics ’ Fair , and , with the rest , stood gazing in wonder at a perfect machine , with its soul of fire , its boiler-heart that sent the hot blood pulsing along the iron arteries , and its thews of steel . And while I was admiring the adaptation of means to end , the harmonious involutions of contrivance , and the never-bewildered complexity , I saw a grimed and greasy fellow , the imperious engine 's lackey and drudge , whose sole office was to let fall , at intervals , a drop or two of oil upon a certain joint . Then my soul said within me , See there a piece of mechanism to which that other you marvel at is but as the rude first effort of a child ,— a force which not merely suffices to set a few wheels in motion , but which can send an impulse all through the infinite future ,— a contrivance , not for turning out pins , or stitching button-holes , but for making Hamlets and Lears . And yet this thing of iron shall be housed , waited on , guarded from rust and dust , and it shall be a crime but so much as to scratch it with a pin ; while the other , with its fire of God in it , shall be buffeted hither and thither , and finally sent carefully a thousand miles to be the target for a Mexican cannon-ball . Unthrifty Mother State ! My heart burned within me for pity and indignation , and I renewed this covenant with my own soul ,— In aliis mansuetus ero , at , in blasphemiis contra Christum , non ita ..— H. W . ]</p>

     <p>[ We have now a tolerably fair chance of estimating how the balance-sheet stands between our returned volunteer and glory . Supposing the entries to be set down on both sides of the account in fractional parts of one hundred , we shall arrive at something like the following result :—</p>
     <p>B. SAWIN , Esq ., in account with ( BLANK ) GLORY .</p>

     <p>100</p>
     <p>E. E .</p>
     <p>It should appear that Mr. Sawin found the actual feast curiously the reverse of the bill of fare advertised in Faneuil Hall and other places . His primary object seems to have been the making of his fortune . Quærenda pecunia primum , virtus post nummos . He hoisted sail for Eldorado , and shipwrecked on Point Tribulation . Quid , non mortalia pectora cogis , auri sacra fames ? The speculation has sometimes crossed my mind , in that dreary interval of drought which intervenes between quarterly stipendiary showers , that Providence , by the creation of a money-tree , might have simplified wonderfully the sometimes perplexing problem of human life . We read of bread-trees , the butter for which lies ready-churned in Irish bogs . Milk-trees we are assured of in South America , and stout Sir John Hawkins testifies to water-trees in the Canaries . Boot-trees bear abundantly in Lynn and elsewhere ; and I have seen , in the entries of the wealthy , hat-trees with a fair show of fruit . A family-tree I once cultivated myself , and found therefrom but a scanty yield , and that quite tasteless and innutritious . Of trees bearing men we are not without examples ; as those in the park of Louis the Eleventh of France . Who has forgotten , moreover , that olive-tree , growing in the Athenian 's back-garden , with its strange uxorious crop , for the general propagation of which , as of a new and precious variety , the philosopher Diogenes , hitherto uninterested in arboriculture , was so zealous ? In the sylva of our own Southern States , the females of my family have called my attention to the china-tree . Not to multiply examples , I will barely add to my list the birch-tree , in the smaller branches of which has been implanted so miraculous a virtue for communicating the Latin and Greek languages , and which may well , therefore , be classed among the trees producing necessaries of life ,— venerabile donum fatalis virgæ . That money-trees existed in the golden age there want not prevalent reasons for our believing . For does not the old proverb , when it asserts that money does not grow on every bush , imply a fortiori that there were certain bushes which did produce it ? Again , there is another ancient saw to the effect that money is the root of all evil . From which two adages it may be safe to infer that the aforesaid species of tree first degenerated into a shrub , then absconded underground , and finally , in our iron age , vanished altogether . In favorable exposures it may be conjectured that a specimen or two survived to a great age , as in the garden of the Hesperides ; and , indeed , what else could that tree in the Sixth Æneid have been with a branch whereof the Trojan hero procured admission to a territory , for the entering of which money is a surer passport than to a certain other more profitable and too foreign kingdom ? Whether these speculations of mine have any force in them , or whether they will not rather , by most readers , be deemed impertinent to the matter in hand , is a question which I leave to the determination of an indulgent posterity . That there were , in more primitive and happier times , shops where money was sold ,— and that , too , on credit and at a bargain ,— I take to be matter of demonstration . For what but a dealer in this article was that Æolus who supplied Ulysses with motive-power for his fleet in bags ? what that Ericus , King of Sweden , who is said to have kept the winds in his cap ? what , in more recent times , those Lapland Nornas who traded in favorable breezes ? All which will appear the more clearly when we consider , that , even to this day , raising the wind is proverbial for raising money , and that brokers and banks were invented by the Venetians at a later period .</p>
     <p>And now for the improvement of this digression . I find a parallel to Mr. Sawin 's fortune in an adventure of my own . For , shortly after I had first broached to myself the before-stated natural-historical and archæological theories , as I was passing , haec negotia penitus mecum revolvens , through one of the obscure suburbs of our New England metropolis , my eye was attracted by these words upon a signboard ,— CHEAP CASH-STORE . Here was at once the confirmation of my speculations , and the substance of my hopes . Here lingered the fragment of a happier past , or stretched out the first tremulous organic filament of a more fortunate future . Thus glowed the distant Mexico to the eyes of Sawin , as he looked through the dirty pane of the recruiting-office window , or speculated from the summit of that mirage-Pisgah which the imps of the bottle are so cunning to raise up . Already had my Alnaschar-fancy ( even during that first half-believing glance ) expended in various useful directions the funds to be obtained by pledging the manuscript of a proposed volume of discourses . Already did a clock ornament the tower of the Jaalam meeting-house , a gift appropriately , but modestly , commemorated in the parish and town records , both , for now many years , kept by myself . Already had my son Seneca completed his course at the University . Whether , for the moment , we may not be considered as actually lording it over those Baratarias with the viceroyalty of which Hope invests us , and whether we are ever so warmly housed as in our Spanish castles , would afford matter of argument . Enough that I found that signboard to be no other than a bait to the trap of a decayed grocer . Nevertheless , I bought a pound of dates ( getting short weight by reason of immense flights of harpy flies who pursued and lighted upon their prey even in the very scales ) , which purchase I made not only with an eye to the little ones at home , but also as a figurative reproof of that too frequent habit of my mind , which , forgetting the due order of chronology , will often persuade me that the happy sceptre of Saturn is stretched over this Astræa-forsaken nineteenth century .</p>
     <p>Having glanced at the ledger of Glory under the title Sawin , B ., let us extend our investigations , and discover if that instructive volume does not contain some charges more personally interesting to ourselves . I think we should be more economical of our resources , did we thoroughly appreciate the fact , that , whenever Brother Jonathan seems to be thrusting his hand into his own pocket , he is , in fact , picking ours . I confess that the late muck which the country has been running has materially changed my views as to the best method of raising revenue . If , by means of direct taxation , the bills for every extraordinary outlay were brought under our immediate eye , so that , like thrifty housekeepers , we could see where and how fast the money was going , we should be less likely to commit extravagances . At present , these things are managed in such a hugger-mugger way , that we know not what we pay for ; the poor man is charged as much as the rich ; and , while we are saving and scrimping at the spigot , the government is drawing off at the bung . If we could know that a part of the money we expend for tea and coffee goes to buy powder and balls , and that it is Mexican blood which makes the clothes on our backs more costly , it would set some of us athinking . During the present fall , I have often pictured to myself a government official entering my study and handing me the following bill :—</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">WASHINGTON , Sept. 30 , 1848 ,</l>
       <l n="2">REV . HOMER WILBUR to Uncle Samuel ,</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Dr. To his share of work done in Mexico on partnership account , sundry jobs , as below . “ killing , maiming and wounding about 5000 Mexicans . . . . . . . . $ 2. 00 “ slaughtering one woman carrying water to wounded . . . . . . . . . . . 10 “ extra work on two different Sabbaths ( one bombardment and one assault ) , whereby the Mexicans were prevented from defiling themselves with the idolatries of high mass . . . . . . 3. 50 “ throwing an especially fortunate and Protestant bomb-shell into the Cathedral at Vera Cruz , whereby several female Papists were slain at the altar . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50 “ his proportion of cash paid for conquered territory . . . . . . . . 1. 75 “ do . do . for conquering do . . . . . 1. 50 “ manuring do . with new superior compost called ‘ American Citizen ’ . . 50 “ extending the area of freedom and Protestantism . . . . . . . . . . . . 01 “ glory . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 01 $ 9. 87 Immediate payment is requested .</p>
     <p>N. B . Thankful for former favors , U. S. requests a continuance of patronage . Orders executed with neatness and despatch . Terms as low as those of any other contractor for the same kind and style of work .</p>
     <p>I can fancy the official answering my look of horror with — ‘ Yes , Sir , it looks like a high charge . Sir ; but in these days slaughtering is slaughtering . ’ Verily , I would that every one understood that it was ; for it goes about obtaining money under the false pretence of being glory . For me , I have an imagination which plays me uncomfortable tricks . It happens to me sometimes to see a slaughterer on his way home from his day 's work , and forthwith my imagination puts a cocked-hat upon his head and epaulettes upon his shoulders , and sets him up as a candidate for the Presidency . So , also , on a recent public occasion , as the place assigned to the ‘ Reverend Clergy ’ is just behind that of ‘ Officers of the Army and Navy ’ in processions , it was my fortune to be seated at the dinner-table over against one of these respectable persons . He was arrayed as ( out of his own profession ) only kings , court-officers , and footmen are in Europe , and Indians in America . Now what does my over-officious imagination but set to work upon him , strip him of his gay livery , and present him to me coatless , his trousers thrust into the tops of a pair of boots thick with clotted blood , and a basket on his arm out of which lolled a gore-smeared axe , thereby destroying my relish for the temporal mercies upon the board before me ! — H. W . ]</p>
     <p>No . IX</p>
     <p>A THIRD LETTER FROM B. SAWIN , ESQ .</p>
     <p>[ Upon the following letter slender comment will be needful . In what river Selemnus has Mr. Sawin bathed , that he has become so swiftly oblivious of his former loves ? From an ardent and ( as befits a soldier ) confident wooer of that coy bride , the popular favor , we see him subside of a sudden into the ( I trust not jilted ) Cincinnatus , returning to his plough with a goodly sized branch of willow in his hand ; figuratively returning , however , to a figurative plough , and from no profound affection for that honored implement of husbandry ( for which , indeed , Mr. Sawin never displayed any decided predilection ) , but in order to be gracefully summoned therefrom to more congenial labors . It should seem that the character of the ancient Dictator had become part of the recognized stock of our modern political comedy , though , as our term of office extends to a quadrennial length , the parallel is not so minutely exact as could be desired . It is sufficiently so , however , for purposes of scenic representation . An humble cottage ( if built of logs , the better ) forms the Arcadian background of the stage . This rustic paradise is labelled Ashland , Jaalam , North Bend , Marshfield , Kinderhook , or Bâton Rouge , as occasion demands . Before the door stands a something with one handle ( the other painted in proper perspective ) , which represents , in happy ideal vagueness , the plough . To this the defeated candidate rushes with delirious joy , welcomed as a father by appropriate groups of happy laborers , or from it the successful one is torn with difficulty , sustained alone by a noble sense of public duty . Only I have observed , that , if the scene be laid at Bâton Rouge or Ashland , the laborers are kept carefully in the backgrouud , and are heard to shout from behind the scenes in a singular tone resembling ululation , and accompanied by a sound not unlike vigorous clapping . This , however , may be artistically in keeping with the habits of the rustic population of those localities . The precise connection between agricultural pursuits and statesmanship I have not been able , after diligent inquiry , to discover . But , that my investigations may not be barren of all fruit , I will mention one curious statistical fact , which I consider thoroughly established , namely , that no real farmer ever attains practically beyond a seat in the General Court , however theoretically qualified for more exalted station .</p>
     <p>It is probable that some other prospect has been opened to Mr. Sawin , and that he has not made this great sacrifice without some definite understanding in regard to a seat in the cabinet or a foreign mission . It may be supposed that we of Jaalam were not untouched by a feeling of villatic pride in beholding our townsman occupying so large a space in the public eye . And to me , deeply revolving the qualifications necessary to a candidate in these frugal times , those of Mr. S. seemed peculiarly adapted to a successful campaign . The loss of a leg , an arm , an eye , and four fingers reduced him so nearly to the condition of a vox et præterea nihil that I could think of nothing but the loss of his head by which his chance could have been bettered . But since he has chosen to balk our suffrages , we must content ourselves with what we can get , remembering lactucas non esse dandas , dum cardui sufficiant ,— H. W . ]</p>

     <p>[ Here , patient reader , we take leave of each other , I trust with some mutual satisfaction . I say patient , for I love not that kind which skims dippingly over the surface of the page , as swallows over a pool before rain . By such no pearls shall be gathered . But if no pearls there be ( as , indeed the world is not without example of books wherefrom the longest-winded diver shall bring up no more than his proper handful of mud ) , yet let us hope that an oyster or two may reward adequate perseverance . If neither pearls nor oysters , yet is patience itself a gem worth diving deeply for .</p>
     <p>It may seem to some that too much space has been usurped by my own private lucubrations , and some may be fain to bring against me that old jest of him who preached all his hearers out of the meeting-house save only the sexton , who , remaining for yet a little space , from a sense of official duty , at last gave out also , and , presenting the keys , humbly requested our preacher to lock the doors , when he should have wholly relieved himself of his testimony . I confess to a satisfaction in the self act of preaching , nor do I esteem a discourse to be wholly thrown away even upon a sleeping or unintelligent auditory . I cannot easily believe that the Gospel of Saint John , which Jacques Cartier ordered to be read in the Latin tongue to the Canadian savages , upon his first meeting with them , fell altogether upon stony ground . For the earnestness of the preacher is a sermon appreciable by dullest intellects and most alien ears . In this wise did Episcopius convert many to his opinions , who yet understood not the language in which he discoursed . The chief thing is that the messenger believe that he has an authentic message to deliver . For counterfeit messengers that mode of treatment which Father John de Plano Carpini relates to have prevailed among the Tartars would seem effectual , and , perhaps , deserved enough . For my own part , I may lay claim to so much of the spirit of martyrdom as would have led me to go into banishment with those clergymen whom Alphonso the Sixth of Portugal drave out of his kingdom for refusing to shorten their pulpit eloquence . It is possible , that , I having been invited into my brother Biglow 's desk , I may have been too little scrupulous in using it for the venting of my own peculiar doctrines to a congregation drawn together in the expectation and with the desire of hearing him .</p>
     <p>I am not wholly unconscious of a peculiarity of mental organization which impels me , like the railroad-engine with its train of cars , to run backward for a short distance in order to obtain a fairer start . I may compare myself to one fishing from the rocks when the sea runs high , who , misinterpreting the suction of the undertow for the biting of some larger fish , jerks suddenly , and finds that he has caught bottom , hauling in upon the end of his line a trail of various algæ , among which , nevertheless , the naturalist may haply find somewhat to repay the disappointment of the angler . Yet have I conscientiously endeavored to adapt myself to the impatient temper of the age , daily degenerating more and more from the high standard of our pristine New England . To the catalogue of lost arts I would mournfully add also that of listening to two-hour sermons . Surely we have been abridged into a race of pygmies . For , truly , in those of the old discourses yet subsisting to us in print , the endless spinal column of divisions and subdivisions can be likened to nothing so exactly as to the vertebræ of the saurians , whence the theorist may conjecture a race of Anakim proportionate to the withstanding of these other monsters . I say Anakim rather than Nephelim , because there seem reasons for supposing that the race of those whose heads ( though no giants ) are constantly enveloped in clouds ( which that name imports ) will never become extinct . The attempt to vanquish the innumerable heads of one of those aforementioned discourses may supply us with a plausible interpretation of the second labor of Hercules , and his successful experiment with fire affords us a useful precedent .</p>
     <p>But while I lament the degeneracy of the age in this regard , I cannot refuse to succumb to its influence . Looking out through my study-window , I see Mr. Biglow at a distance busy in gathering his Baldwins , of which , to judge by the number of barrels lying about under the trees , his crop is more abundant than my own ,— by which sight I am admonished to turn to those orchards of the mind wherein my labors may be more prospered , and apply myself diligently to the preparation of my next Sabbath 's discourse .— H.

     <note>When the book appeared it bore a dedication to E. R . Hoar , and was introduced by an essay of the Yankee form of English speech . This Introduction is so distinctly an essay that it has been thought best to print it as an appendix to this volume , rather than allow it to break in upon the pages of verse . There is , however , one passage in it which may be repeated here , since it bears directly upon the poem which serves as a sort of prelude to the series .</note>
     <p>‘ The only attempt I had ever made at anything like a pastoral ( if that may be called an attempt which was the result almost of pure accident ) was in The Courtin ’ . While the introduction to the First Series was going through the press , I received word from the printer that there was a blank page left which must be filled . I sat down at once and improvised another fictitious “ notice of the press , ” in which , because verse would fill up space more cheaply than prose , I inserted an extract from a supposed ballad of Mr. Biglow . I kept no copy of it , and the printer , as directed , cut it off when the gap was filled . Presently I began to receive letters asking for the rest of it , sometimes for the balance of it . I had none , but to answer such demands , I patched a conclusion upon it in a later edition . Those who had only the first continued to importune me . Afterward , being asked to write it out as an autograph for the Baltimore Sanitary Commission Fair , I added other verses , into some of which I infused a little more sentiment in a homely way , and after a fashion completed it by sketching in the characters and making a connected story . Most likely I have spoiled it , but I shall put it at the end of this Introduction , to answer once for all those kindly importunings . ’</p>

     <p>It is not from any idle wish to obtrude my humble person with undue prominence upon the publick view that I resume my pen upon the present occasion . Juniores ad labores . But having been a main instrument in rescuing the talent of my young parishioner from being buried in the ground , by giving it such warrant with the world as could be derived from a name already widely known by several printed discourses ( all of which I may be permitted without immodesty to state have been deemed worthy of preservation in the Library of Harvard College by my esteemed friend Mr. Sibley ) , it seemed becoming that I should not only testify to the genuineness of the following production , but call attention to it , the more as Mr. Biglow had so long been silent as to be in danger of absolute oblivion . I insinuate no claim to any share in the authorship ( vix ea nostra voco ) of the works already published by Mr. Biglow , but merely take to myself the credit of having fulfilled toward them the office of taster ( experto crede ) , who , having first tried , could afterward bear witness ( credenzen it was aptly named by the Germans ) , an office always arduous , and sometimes even dangerous , as in the case of those devoted persons who venture their lives in the deglutition of patent medicines ( dolus latet in generalibus , there is deceit in the most of them ) and thereafter are wonderfully preserved long enough to append their signatures to testimonials in the diurnal and hebdomadal prints . I say not this as covertly glancing at the authors of certain manuscripts which have been submitted to my literary judgment ( though an epick in twenty-four books on the ‘ Taking of Jericho ’ might , save for the prudent forethought of Mrs. Wilbur in secreting the same just as I had arrived beneath the walls and was beginning a catalogue of the various horns and their blowers , too ambitiously emulous in longanimity of Homer 's list of ships , might , I say , have rendered frustrate any hope I could entertain vacare Musis for the small remainder of my days ) , but only the further to secure myself against any imputation of unseemly forthputting . I will barely subjoin , in this connexion , that , whereas Job was left to desire , in the soreness of his heart , that his adversary had written a book , as perchance misanthropically wishing to indite a review thereof , yet was not Satan allowed so far to tempt him as to send Bildad , Eliphaz , and Zophar each with an unprinted work in his wallet to be submitted to his censure . But of this enough . Were I in need of other excuse , I might add that I write by the express desire of Mr. Biglow himself , whose entire winter leisure is occupied , as he assures me , in answering demands for autographs , a labor exacting enough in itself , and egregiously so to him , who , being no ready penman , cannot sign so much as his name without strange contortions of the face ( his nose , even , being essential to complete success ) and painfully suppressed Saint-Vitus-dance of every muscle in his body . This , with his having been put in the Commission of the Peace by our excellent Governor ( O , si sic omnes ! ) immediately on his accession to office , keeps him continually employed . Haud inexpertus loquor , having for many years written myself J. P ., and being not seldom applied to for specimens of my chirography , a request to which I have sometimes over weakly assented , believing as I do that nothing written of set purpose can properly be called an autograph , but only those unpremeditated sallies and lively runnings which betray the fireside Man instead of the hunted Notoriety doubling on his pursuers . But it is time that I should bethink me of St. Austin 's prayer , libera me a meipso , if I would arrive at the matter in hand .</p>
     <p>Moreover , I had yet another reason for taking up the pen myself . I am informed that ‘ The Atlantic Monthly ’ is mainly indebted for its success to the contributions and editorial supervision of Dr. Holmes , whose excellent ‘ Annals of America ’ occupy an honored place upon my shelves . The journal itself I have never seen ; but if this be so , it might seem that the recommendation of a brother-clergyman ( though par magis quam similis ) should carry a greater weight . I suppose that you have a department for historical lucubrations , and should be glad , if deemed desirable , to forward for publication my ‘ Collections for the Antiquities of Jaalam , ’ and my ( now happily complete ) pedigree of the Wilbur family from its fons et origo , the Wild Boar of Ardennes . Withdrawn from the active duties of my profession by the settlement of a colleague-pastor , the Reverend Jeduthun Hitchcock , formerly of Brutus Four-Corners , I might find time for further contributions to general literature on similar topicks . I have made large advances towards a completer genealogy of Mrs. Wilbur 's family , the Pilcoxes , not , if I know myself , from any idle vanity , but with the sole desire of rendering myself useful in my day and generation . Nulla dies sine lineâ . I inclose a meteorological register , a list of the births , deaths , and marriages , and a few memorabilia of longevity in Jaalam East Parish for the last half-century . Though spared to the unusual period of more than eighty years , I find no diminution of my faculties or abatement of my natural vigor , except a scarcely sensible decay of memory and a necessity of recurring to younger eyesight or spectacles for the finer print in Cruden . It would gratify me to make some further provision for declining years from the emoluments of my literary labors . I had intended to effect an insurance on my life , but was deterred therefrom by a circular from one of the offices , in which the sudden death of so large a proportion of the insured was set forth as an inducement , that it seemed to me little less than a tempting of Providence . Neque in summâ inopiâ levis esse senectus potest , ne sapienti quidem .</p>
     <p>Thus far concerning Mr. Biglow ; and so much seemed needful ( brevis esse laboro ) by way of preliminary , after a silence of fourteen years . He greatly fears lest he may in this essay have fallen below himself , well knowing that , if exercise be dangerous on a full stomach , no less so is writing on a full reputation . Beset as he has been on all sides , he could not refrain , and would only imprecate patience till he shall again have ‘ got the hang ’ ( as he calls it ) of an accomplishment long disused . The letter of Mr. Sawin was received some time in last June , and others have followed which will in due season be submitted to the publick . How largely his statements are to be depended on , I more than merely dubitate . He was always distinguished for a tendency to exaggeration ,— it might almost be qualified by a stronger term . Fortiter mentire , aliquid hæret seemed to be his favorite rule of rhetoric . That he is actually where he says he is the postmark would seem to confirm ; that he was received with the publick demonstrations he describes would appear consonant with what we know of the habits of those regions ; but further than this I venture not to decide . I have sometimes suspected a vein of humor in him which leads him to speak by contraries ; but since , in the unrestrained intercourse of private life , I have never observed in him any striking powers of invention , I am the more willing to put a certain qualified faith in the incidents and the details of life and manners which give to his narratives some portion of the interest and entertainment which characterizes a Century Sermon .</p>
     <p>It may be expected of me that I should say something to justify myself with the world for a seeming inconsistency with my well-known principles in allowing my youngest son to raise a company for the war , a fact known to all through the medium of the publick prints . I did reason with the young man , but expellas naturam furcâ tamen usque recurrit . Having myself been a chaplain in 1812 , I could the less wonder that a man of war had sprung from my loins . It was , indeed , grievous to send my Benjamin , the child of my old age ; but after the discomfiture of Manassas , I with my own hands did buckle on his armor , trusting in the great Comforter and Commander for strength according to my need . For truly the memory of a brave son dead in his shroud were a greater staff of my declining years than a living coward ( if those may be said to have lived who carry all of themselves into the grave with them ) , though his days might be long in the land , and he should get much goods . It is not till our earthen vessels are broken that we find and truly possess the treasure that was laid up in them . Migravi in animam meam , I have sought refuge in my own soul ; nor would I be shamed by the heathen comedian with his Neqwam illud verbum , bene vult , nisi bene facit . During our dark days , I read constantly in the inspired book of Job , which I believe to contain more food to maintain the fibre of the soul for right living and high thinking than all pagan literature together , though I would by no means vilipend the study of the classicks . There I read that Job said in his despair , even as the fool saith in his heart there is no God ,— ‘ The tabernacles of robbers prosper , and they that provoke God are secure . ’ ( Job xii . 6 . ) But I sought farther till I found this Scripture also , which I would have those perpend who have striven to turn our Israel aside to the worship of strange gods .— ‘ If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maid-servant , when they contended with me , what then shall I do when God riseth up ? and when he visiteth , what shall I answer him ? ’ ( Job xxxi . 13 , 14 . ) On this text I preached a discourse on the last day of Fasting and Humiliation with general acceptance , though there were not wanting one or two Laodiceans who said that I should have waited till the President announced his policy . But let us hope and pray , remembering this of Saint Gregory , Vult Deus rogari , vult cogi , vult quâdam importunitate vinci .</p>
     <p>We had our first fall of snow on Friday last . Frosts have been unusually backward this fall . A singular circumstance occurred in this town on the 20th October , in the family of Deacon Pelatiah Tinkham . On the previous evening , a few moments before family prayers ,</p>
     <note>The editors of the ‘ Atlantic ’ find it necessary here to cut short the letter of their valued correspondent , which seemed calculated rather on the rates of longevity in Jaalam than for less favored localities . They have every encouragement to hope that he will write again .</note>
     <p>With esteem and respect , Your obedient servant , Homer Wilbur , A. M .</p>

      <head>MASON AND SLIDELL : A YANKEE IDYLL</head>
      <head>TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY</head>
       <l n="1">JAALAM , 6th Jan ., 1862 .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Gentlemen ,— I was highly gratified by the insertion of a portion of my letter in the last number of your valuable and entertaining Miscellany , though in a type which rendered its substance inaccessible even to the beautiful new spectacles presented to me by a Committee of the Parish on New Year 's Day . I trust that I was able to bear your very considerable abridgment of my lucubrations with a spirit becoming a Christian . My third granddaughter , Rebekah , aged fourteen years , and whom I have trained to read slowly and with proper emphasis ( a practice too much neglected in our modern systems of education ) , read aloud to me the excellent essay upon ‘ Old Age , ’ the author of which I cannot help suspecting to be a young man who has never yet known what it was to have snow ( canities morosa ) upon his own roof . Dissolve frigus , large super foco ligna reponens , is a rule for the young , whose woodpile is yet abundant for such cheerful lenitives . A good life behind him is the best thing to keep an old man 's shoulders from shivering at every breath of sorrow or ill-fortune . But methinks it were easier for an old man to feel the disadvantages of youth than the advantages of age . Of these latter I reckon one of the chiefest to be this : that we attach a less inordinate value to our own productions , and , distrusting daily more and more our own wisdom ( with the conceit whereof at twenty we wrap ourselves away from knowledge as with a garment ) , do reconcile ourselves with the wisdom of God . I could have wished , indeed , that room might have been made for the residue of the anecdote relating to Deacon Tinkham , which would not only have gratified a natural curiosity on the part of the publick ( as I have reason to know from several letters of inquiry already received ) , but would also , as I think , have largely increased the circulation of your Magazine in this town . Nihil humani alienum , there is a curiosity about the affairs of our neighbors which is not only pardonable , but even commendable . But I shall abide a more fitting season .</p>
     <p>As touching the following literary effort of Esquire Biglow , much might be profitably said on the topick of Idyllick and Pastoral Poetry , and concerning the proper distinctions to be made between them , from Theocritus , the inventor of the former , to Collins , the latest authour I know of who has emulated the classicks in the latter style . But in the time of a Civil War worthy a Milton to defend and a Lucan to sing , it may be reasonably doubted whether the publick , never too studious of serious instruction , might not consider other objects more deserving of present attention . Concerning the title of Idyll , which Mr. Biglow has adopted at my suggestion , it may not be improper to animadvert , that the name properly signifies a poem somewhat rustick in phrase ( for , though the learned are not agreed as to the particular dialect employed by Theocritus , they are universanimous both as to its rusticity and its capacity of rising now and then to the level of more elevated sentiments and expressions ) , while it is also descriptive of real scenery and manners . Yet it must be admitted that the production now in question ( which here and there bears perhaps too plainly the marks of my correcting hand ) does partake of the nature of a Pastoral , inasmuch as the interlocutors therein are purely imaginary beings , and the whole is little better than [ Greek : kapnou skias onar ] . The plot was , as I believe , suggested by the ‘ Twa Brigs ’ of Robert Burns , a Scottish poet of the last century , as that found its prototype in the ‘ Mutual Complaint of Plainstanes and Causey ’ by Fergusson , though , the metre of this latter be different by a foot in each verse . Perhaps the Two Dogs of Cervantes gave the first hint . I reminded my talented young parishioner and friend that Concord Bridge had long since yielded to the edacious tooth of Time . But he answered me to this effect : that there was no greater mistake of an authour than to suppose the reader had no fancy of his own ; that , if once that faculty was to be called into activity , it were better to be in for the whole sheep than the shoulder ; and that he knew Concord like a book ,— an expression questionable in propriety , since there are few things with which he is not more familiar than with the printed page . In proof of what he affirmed , he showed me some verses which with others he had stricken out as too much delaying the action , but which I communicate in this place because they rightly define ‘ punkin-seed ’ ( which Mr. Bartlett would have a kind of perch ,— a creature to which I have found a rod or pole not to be so easily equivalent in our inland waters as in the books of arithmetic ) and because it conveys an eulogium on the worthy son of an excellent father , with whose acquaintance ( eheu , fugaces anni ! ) I was formerly honoured .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>Concerning the subject-matter of the verses . I have not the leisure at present to write so fully as I could wish , my time being occupied with the preparation of a discourse for the forthcoming bicentenary celebration of the first settlement of Jaalam East Parish . It may gratify the publick interest to mention the circumstance , that my investigations to this end have enabled me to verify the fact ( of much historick importance , and hitherto hotly debated ) that Shearjashub Tarbox was the first child of white parentage born in this town , being named in his father 's will under date August 7th , or 9th , 1662 . It is well known that those who advocate the claims of Mehetable Goings are unable to find any trace of her existence prior to October of that year . As respects the settlement of the Mason and Slidell question , Mr. Biglow has not incorrectly stated the popular sentiment , so far as I can judge by its expression in this locality . For myself , I feel more sorrow than resentment : for I am old enough to have heard those talk of England who still , even after the unhappy estrangement , could not unschool their lips from calling her the Mother-Country . But England has insisted on ripping up old wounds , and has undone the healing work of fifty years ; for nations do not reason , they only feel , and the spretæ injuria formæ rankles in their minds as bitterly as in that of a woman . And because this is so , I feel the more satisfaction that our Government has acted ( as all Governments should , standing as they do between the people and their passions ) as if it had arrived at years of discretion . There are three short and simple words , the hardest of all to pronounce in any language ( and I suspect they were no easier before the confusion of tongues ) , but which no man or nation that cannot utter can claim to have arrived at manhood . Those words are , I was wrong ; and I am proud that , while England played the boy , our rulers had strength enough from the People below and wisdom enough from God above to quit themselves like men .</p>
     <p>The sore points on both sides have been skilfully exasperated by interested and unscrupulous persons , who saw in a war between the two countries the only hope of profitable return for their investment in Confederate stock , whether political or financial . The always supercilious , often insulting , and sometimes even brutal tone of British journals and publick men has certainly not tended to soothe whatever resentment might exist in America .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ Perhaps it was right to dissemble your love ,</l>
       <l n="2">But why did you kick me down stairs ? ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>We have no reason to complain that England , as a necessary consequence of her clubs , has become a great society for the minding of other people 's business , and we can smile good-naturedly when she lectures other nations on the sins of arrogance and conceit : but we may justly consider it a breach of the political convenances which are expected to regulate the intercourse of one well-bred government with another , when men holding places in the ministry allow themselves to dictate our domestic policy , to instruct us in our duty , and to stigmatize as unholy a war for the rescue of whatever a high-minded people should hold most vital and most sacred . Was it in good taste , that I may use the mildest term , for Earl Russell to expound our own Constitution to President Lincoln , or to make a new and fallacious application of an old phrase for our benefit , and tell us that the Rebels were fighting for independence and we for empire ? As if all wars for independence were by nature just and deserving of sympathy , and all wars for empire ignoble and worthy only of reprobation , or as if these easy phrases in any way characterized this terrible struggle ,— terrible not so truly in any superficial sense , as from the essential and deadly enmity of the principles that underlie it . His Lordship 's bit of borrowed rhetoric would justify Smith O'Brien , Nana Sahib , and the Maori chieftains , while it would condemn nearly every war in which England has ever been engaged . Was it so very presumptuous in us to think that it would be decorous in English statesmen if they spared time enough to acquire some kind of knowledge , though of the most elementary kind , in regard to this country and the questions at issue here , before they pronounced so off-hand a judgment ? Or is political information expected to come Dogberry-fashion in England , like reading and writing , by nature ?</p>
     <p>And now all respectable England is wondering at our irritability , and sees a quite satisfactory explanation of it in our national vanity . Suave mari magno , it is pleasant , sitting in the easy-chairs of Downing Street , to sprinkle pepper on the raw wounds of a kindred people struggling for life , and philosophical to find in self-conceit the cause of our instinctive resentment . Surely we were of all nations the least liable to any temptation of vanity at a time when the gravest anxiety and the keenest sorrow were never absent from our hearts . Nor is conceit the exclusive attribute of any one nation . The earliest of English travellers , Sir John Mandeville , took a less provincial view of the matter when he said , ‘ For fro what partie of the erthe that men duellen , other aboven or beneathen , it semethe alweys to hem that duellen that thei gon more righte than any other folke . ’ The English have always had their fair share of this amiable quality . We may say of them still , as the authour of the ‘ Lettres Cabalistiques ’ said of them more than a century ago , ‘ Ces derniers disent naturellement qu'il n'y a qu'eux qui soient estimables ’ . And , as he also says ,' J'aimerois presque autant tomber entre les mains d'un Inquisiteur que d'un Anglois qui me fait sentir sans cesse combien il s'estime plus que moi , et qui ne daigne me parler que pour injurier ma Nation et pour m'ennuyer du récit des grandes qualités de la sienne . ’ Of this Bull we may safely say with Horace , habet fænum in cornu . What we felt to be especially insulting was the quiet assumption that the descendants of men who left the Old World for the sake of principle , and who had made the wilderness into a New World patterned after an Idea , could not possibly be susceptible of a generous or lofty sentiment , could have no feeling of nationality deeper than that of a tradesman for his shop . One would have thought , in listening to England , that we were presumptuous in fancying that we were a nation at all , or had any other principle of union than that of booths at a fair , where there is no higher notion of government than the constable , or better image of God than that stamped upon the current coin .</p>
     <p>It is time for Englishmen to consider whether there was nothing in the spirit of their press and of their leading public men calculated to rouse a just indignation , and to cause a permanent estrangement on the part of any nation capable of self-respect , and sensitively jealous , as ours then was , of foreign interference . Was there nothing in the indecent haste with which belligerent rights were conceded to the Rebels , nothing in the abrupt tone assumed in the Trent case , nothing in the fitting out of Confederate privateers , that might stir the blood of a people already overcharged with doubt , suspicion , and terrible responsibility ? The laity in any country do not stop to consider points of law , but they have an instinctive perception of the animus that actuates the policy of a foreign nation ; and in our own case they remembered that the British authorities in Canada did not wait till diplomacy could send home to England for her slow official tinder-box to fire the ‘ Caroline . ’ Add to this , what every sensible American knew , that the moral support of England was equal to an army of two hundred thousand men to the Rebels , while it insured us another year or two of exhausting war . It was not so much the spite of her words ( though the time might have been more tastefully chosen ) as the actual power for evil in them that we felt as a deadly wrong . Perhaps the most immediate and efficient cause of mere irritation was , the sudden and unaccountable change of manner on the other side of the water . Only six months before , the Prince of Wales had come over to call us cousins ; and everywhere it was nothing but ‘ our American brethren , ’ that great offshoot of British institutions in the New World , so almost identical with them in laws , language , and literature ,— this last of the alliterative compliments being so bitterly true , that perhaps it will not be retracted even now . To this outburst of long-repressed affection we responded with genuine warmth , if with something of the awkwardness of a poor relation bewildered with the sudden tightening of the ties of consanguinity when it is rumored that he has come into a large estate . Then came the Rebellion , and , presto ! a flaw in our titles was discovered , the plate we were promised at the family table is flung at our head , and we were again the scum of creation , intolerably vulgar , at once cowardly and overbearing ,— no relations of theirs , after all , but a dreggy hybrid of the basest bloods of Europe . Panurge was not quicker to call Friar John his former friend . I cannot help thinking of Walter Mapes 's jingling paraphrase of Petronius ,—</p>

     <p>There was nothing in all this to exasperate a philosopher , much to make him smile rather ; but the earth 's surface is not chiefly inhabited by philosophers , and I revive the recollection of it now in perfect good-humour , merely by way of suggesting to our ci-devant British cousins , that it would have been easier for them to hold their tongues than for us to keep our tempers under the circumstances .</p>
     <p>The English Cabinet made a blunder , unquestionably , in taking it so hastily for granted that the United States had fallen forever from their position as a first-rate power , and it was natural that they should vent a little of their vexation on the people whose inexplicable obstinacy in maintaining freedom and order , and in resisting degradation , was likely to convict them of their mistake . But if bearing a grudge be the sure mark of a small mind in the individual , can it be a proof of high spirit in a nation ? If the result of the present estrangement between the two countries shall be to make us more independent of British twaddle ( Indomito nec dira ferens stipendia Tauro ) , so much the better ; but if it is to make us insensible to the value of British opinion in matters where it gives us the judgment of an impartial and cultivated outsider , if we are to shut ourselves out from the advantages of English culture , the loss will be ours , and not theirs . Because the door of the old homestead has been once slammed in our faces , shall we in a huff reject all future advances of conciliation , and cut ourselves foolishly off from any share in the humanizing influences of the place , with its ineffable riches of association , its heirlooms of immemorial culture , its historic monuments , ours no less than theirs , its noble gallery of ancestral portraits ? We have only to succeed , and England will not only respect , but , for the first time , begin to understand us . And let us not , in our justifiable indignation at wanton insult , forget that England is not the England only of snobs who dread the democracy they do not comprehend , but the England of history , of heroes , statesmen , and poets , whose names are dear , and their influence as salutary to us as to her .</p>
     <p>Let us strengthen the hands of those in authority over us , and curb our own tongues , remembering that General Wait commonly proves in the end more than a match for General Headlong , and that the Good Book ascribes safety to a multitude , indeed , but not to a mob , of counsellours . Let us remember and perpend the words of Paulus Emilius to the people of Rome ; that , ‘ if they judged they could manage the war to more advantage by any other , he would willingly yield up his charge ; but if they confided in him , they were not to make themselves his colleagues in his office , or raise reports , or criticise his actions , but , without talking , supply him with means and assistance necessary to the carrying on of the war ; for , if they proposed to command their own commander , they would render this expedition more ridiculous than the former . ’ ( Vide Plutarchum in Vitâ P. E . ) Let us also not forget what the same excellent authour says concerning Perseus 's fear of spending money , and not permit the covetousness of Brother Jonathan to be the good fortune of Jefferson Davis . For my own part , till I am ready to admit the Commander-in-Chief to my pulpit , I shall abstain from planning his battles . If courage be the sword , yet is patience the armour of a nation ; and in our desire for peace , let us never be willing to surrender the Constitution bequeathed us by fathers at least as wise as ourselves ( even with Jefferson Davis to help us ) , and , with those degenerate Romans , tuta et præsentia quam vetera et periculosa malle .</p>
     <p>And not only should we bridle our own tongues , but the pens of others , which are swift to convey useful intelligence to the enemy . This is no new inconvenience ; for , under date , 3d June , 1745 , General Pepperell wrote thus to Governor Shirley from Louisbourg : ‘ What your Excellency observes of the army 's being made acquainted with any plans proposed , until ready to be put in execution , has always been disagreeable to me , and I have given many cautions relating to it . But when your Excellency considers that our Council of War consists of more than twenty members , I am persuaded you will think it impossible for me to hinder it , if any of them will persist in communicating to inferior officers and soldiers what ought to be kept secret . I am informed that the Boston newspapers are filled with paragraphs from private letters relating to the expedition . Will your Excellency permit me to say I think it may be of ill consequence ? Would it not be convenient , if your Excellency should forbid the Printers ’ inserting such news ? ’ Verily , if tempora mutantur , we may question the et nos mutamur in illis ; and if tongues be leaky , it will need all hands at the pumps to save the Ship of State . Our history dotes and repeats itself . If Sassycus ( rather than Alcibiades ) find a parallel in Beauregard , so Weakwash , as he is called by the brave Lieutenant Lion Gardiner , need not seek far among our own Sachems for his anti-type .</p>

      <head>BIRDOFREDUM SAWIN , ESQ ., TO MR. HOSEA BIGLOW</head>
       <l n="1">With the following Letter from the REVEREND HOMER WILBUR , A. M .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY</head>
       <l n="1">JAALAM , 7th Feb ., 1862 .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>RESPECTED FRIENDS ,— If I know myself ,— and surely a man can hardly be supposed to have overpassed the limit of fourscore years without attaining to some proficiency in that most useful branch of learning ( e coelo descendit , says the pagan poet ) ,— I have no great smack of that weakness which would press upon the publick attention any matter pertaining to my private affairs . But since the following letter of Mr. Sawin contains not only a direct allusion to myself , but that in connection with a topick of interest to all those engaged in the publick ministrations of the sanctuary , I may be pardoned for touching briefly thereupon . Mr. Sawin was never a stated attendant upon my preaching ,— never , as I believe , even an occasional one , since the erection of the new house ( where we now worship ) in 1845 . He did , indeed , for a time , supply a not unacceptable bass in the choir ; but , whether on some umbrage ( omnibus hoc vitium est cantoribus ) taken against the bass-viol , then , and till his decease in 1850 ( æt . 77 ,) under the charge of Mr. Asaph Perley , or , as was reported by others , on account of an imminent subscription for a new bell , he thenceforth absented himself from all outward and visible communion . Yet he seems to have preserved ( altâ mente repostum ) , as it were , in the pickle of a mind soured by prejudice , a lasting scunner , as he would call it , against our staid and decent form of worship ; for I would rather in that wise interpret his fling , than suppose that any chance tares sown by my pulpit discourses should survive so long , while good seed too often fails to root itself . I humbly trust that I have no personal feeling in the matter ; though I know that , if we sound any man deep enough , our lead shall bring up the mud of human nature at last . The Bretons believe in an evil spirit which they call ar c'houskezik , whose office it is to make the congregation drowsy ; and though I have never had reason to think that he was specially busy among my flock , yet have I seen enough to make me sometimes regret the hinged seats of the ancient meeting-house , whose lively clatter , not unwillingly intensified by boys beyond eyeshot of the tithing-man , served at intervals as a wholesome réveil . It is true , I have numbered among my parishioners some who are proof against the prophylactick fennel , nay , whose gift of somnolence rivalled that of the Cretan Rip Van Winkle , Epimenides , and who , nevertheless , complained not so much of the substance as of the length of my ( by them unheard ) discourses . Some ingenious persons of a philosophick turn have assured us that our pulpits were set too high , and that the soporifick tendency increased with the ratio of the angle in which the hearer 's eye was constrained to seek the preacher . This were a curious topick for investigation . There can be no doubt that some sermons are pitched too high , and I remember many struggles with the drowsy fiend in my youth . Happy Saint Anthony of Padua , whose finny acolytes , however they might profit , could never murmur ! Quare fremuerunt gentes ? Who is he that can twice a week be inspired , or has eloquence ( ut ita dicam ) always on tap ? A good man , and , next to David , a sacred poet ( himself , haply , not inexpert of evil in this particular ) , has said ,—</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ The worst speak something good : if all want sense ,</l>
       <l n="2">God takes a text and preacheth patience . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>There are one or two other points in Mr. Sawin 's letter which I would also briefly animadvert upon . And first , concerning the claim he sets up to a certain superiority of blood and lineage in the people of our Southern States , now unhappily in rebellion against lawful authority and their own better interests . There is a sort of opinions , anachronisms at once and anachorisms , foreign both to the age and the country , that maintain a feeble and buzzing existence , scarce to be called life , like winter flies , which in mild weather crawl out from obscure nooks and crannies to expatiate in the sun , and sometimes acquire vigor enough to disturb with their enforced familiarity the studious hours of the scholar . One of the most stupid and pertinacious of these is the theory that the Southern States were settled by a class of emigrants from the Old World socially superior to those who founded the institutions of New England . The Virginians especially lay claim to this generosity of lineage , which were of no possible account , were it not for the fact that such superstitions are sometimes not without their effect on the course of human affairs . The early adventurers to Massachusetts at least paid their passages ; no felons were ever shipped thither ; and though it be true that many deboshed younger brothers of what are called good families may have sought refuge in Virginia , it is equally certain that a great part of the early deportations thither were the sweepings of the London streets and the leavings of the London stews . It was this my Lord Bacon had in mind when he wrote : ‘ It is a shameful and unblessed thing to take the scum of people and wicked condemned men to be the people with whom you plant . ’ That certain names are found there is nothing to the purpose , for , even had an alias been beyond the invention of the knaves of that generation , it is known that servants were often called by their masters ’ names , as slaves are now . On what the heralds call the spindle side , some , at least , of the oldest Virginian families are descended from matrons who were exported and sold for so many hogsheads of tobacco the head . So notorious was this , that it became one of the jokes of contemporary playwrights , not only that men bankrupt in purse and character were ‘ food for the Plantations ’ ( and this before the settlement of New England ) , but also that any drab would suffice to wive such pitiful adventurers . ‘ Never choose a wife as if you were going to Virginia , ’ says Middleton in one of his comedies . The mule is apt to forget all but the equine side of his pedigree . How early the counterfeit nobility of the Old Dominion became a topick of ridicule in the Mother Country may be learned from a play of Mrs. Behn 's , founded on the Rebellion of Bacon : for even these kennels of literature may yield a fact or two to pay the raking . Mrs. Flirt , the keeper of a Virginia ordinary , calls herself the daughter of a baronet , ‘ undone in the late rebellion , ’ — her father having in truth been a tailor ,— and three of the Council , assuming to themselves an equal splendor of origin , are shown to have been , one ‘ a broken exciseman who came over a poor servant , ’ another a tinker transported for theft , and the third ‘ a common pickpocket often flogged at the cart 's tail . ’ The ancestry of South Carolina will as little pass muster at the Herald 's Visitation , though I hold them to have been more reputable , inasmuch as many of them were honest tradesmen and artisans , in some measure exiles for conscience ’ sake , who would have smiled at the high-flying nonsense of their descendants . Some of the more respectable were Jews . The absurdity of supposing a population of eight millions all sprung from gentle loins in the course of a century and a half is too manifest for confutation . But of what use to discuss the matter ? An expert genealogist will provide any solvent man with a genus et pro avos to order . My Lord Burleigh used to say , with Aristotle and the Emperor Frederick II . to back him , that ‘ nobility was ancient riches , ’ whence also the Spanish were wont to call their nobles ricos hombres , and the aristocracy of America are the descendants of those who first became wealthy , by whatever means . Petroleum will in this wise be the source of much good blood among our posterity . The aristocracy of the South , such as it is , has the shallowest of all foundations , for it is only skin-deep ,— the most odious of all , for , while affecting to despise trade , it traces its origin to a successful traffick in men , women , and children , and still draws its chief revenues thence . And though , as Doctor Chamberlayne consolingly says in his ‘ Present State of England , ’ ‘ to become a Merchant of Foreign Commerce , without serving any Apprentisage , hath been allowed no disparagement to a Gentleman born , especially to a younger Brother , ’ yet I conceive that he would hardly have made a like exception in favour of the particular trade in question . Oddly enough this trade reverses the ordinary standards of social respectability no less than of morals , for the retail and domestick is as creditable as the wholesale and foreign is degrading to him who follows it . Are our morals , then , no better than mores after all ? I do not believe that such aristocracy as exists at the South ( for I hold with Marius , fortissimum quemque generosissimum ) will be found an element of anything like persistent strength in war ,— thinking the saying of Lord Bacon ( whom one quaintly called inductionis dominus et Verulamii ) as true as it is pithy , that ‘ the more gentlemen , ever the lower books of subsidies . ’ It is odd enough as an historical precedent , that , while the fathers of New England were laying deep in religion , education , and freedom the basis of a polity which has substantially outlasted any then existing , the first work of the founders of Virginia , as may be seen in Wingfield 's ‘ Memorial , ’ was conspiracy and rebellion ,— odder yet , as showing the changes which are wrought by circumstance , that the first insurrection , in South Carolina was against the aristocratical scheme of the Proprietary Government . I do not find that the cuticular aristocracy of the South has added anything to the refinements of civilization except the carrying of bowie-knives and the chewing of tobacco ,— a high-toned Southern gentleman being commonly not only quadrumanous but quidruminant .</p>
     <p>I confess that the present letter of Mr. Sawin increases my doubts as to the sincerity of the convictions which he professes , and I am inclined to think that the triumph , of the legitimate Government , sure sooner or later to take place , will find him and a large majority of his newly adopted fellow-citizens ( who hold with Dædalus , the primal sitter-on-the-fence , that medium tenere tutissimum ) original Union men . The criticisms towards the close of his letter on certain of our failings are worthy to be seriously perpended ; for he is not , as I think , without a spice of vulgar shrewdness . Fas est et ab hoste doceri : there is no reckoning without your host . As to the good-nature in us which he seems to gird at , while I would not consecrate a chapel , as they have not scrupled to do in France , to Notre Dame de la Haine ( Our Lady of Hate ) , yet I cannot forget that the corruption of good-nature is the generation of laxity of principle . Good-nature is our national characteristick ; and though it be , perhaps , nothing more than a culpable weakness or cowardice , when it leads us to put up tamely with manifold impositions and breaches of implied contracts ( as too frequently in our publick conveyances ) it becomes a positive crime when it leads us to look unresentfully on peculation , and to regard treason to the best Government that ever existed as something with which a gentleman may shake hands without soiling his fingers . I do not think the gallows-tree the most profitable member of our Sylva ; but , since it continues to be planted , I would fain see a Northern limb ingrafted on it , that it may bear some other fruit than loyal Tennesseeans .</p>
     <p>A relick has recently been discovered on the east bank of Bushy Brook in North Jaalam , which I conceive to be an inscription in Runick characters relating to the early expedition of the Northmen to this continent . I shall make fuller investigations , and communicate the result in due season .</p>
     <p>Respectfully ,</p>
     <p>Your obedient servant ,</p>

     <lg type="poem">
      <head>TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY</head>
       <l n="1">JAALAM , 10th March , 1862 .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>GENTLEMEN ,— My leisure has been so entirely occupied with the hitherto fruitless endeavour to decypher the Runick inscription whose fortunate discovery I mentioned in my last communication , that I have not found time to discuss , as I had intended , the great problem of what we are to do with slavery ,— a topick on which the publick mind in this place is at present more than ever agitated . What my wishes and hopes are I need not say , but for safe conclusions I do not conceive that we are yet in possession of facts enough on which to bottom them with certainty . Acknowledging the hand of Providence , as I do , in all events , I am sometimes inclined to think that they are wiser than we , and am willing to wait till we have made this continent once more a place where freemen can live in security and honour , before assuming any further responsibility . This is the view taken by my neighbour Habakkuk Sloansure , Esq ., the president of our bank , whose opinion in the practical affairs of life has great weight with me , as I have generally found it to be justified by the event , and whose counsel , had I followed it , would have saved me from an unfortunate investment of a considerable part of the painful economies of half a century in the Northwest-Passage Tunnel . After a somewhat animated discussion with this gentleman a few days since , I expanded , on the audi alteram partem principle , something which he happened to say by way of illustration , into the following fable .</p>

     <p>I think that nothing will ever give permanent peace and security to this continent but the extirpation of Slavery therefrom , and that the occasion is nigh ; but I would do nothing hastily or vindictively , nor presume to jog the elbow of Providence . No desperate measures for me till we are sure that all others are hopeless ,— flectere si nequeo SUPEROS , Acheronta movebo . To make Emancipation a reform instead of a revolution is worth a little patience , that we may have the Border States first , and then the non-slaveholders of the Cotton States , with us in principle ,— a consummation that seems to be nearer than many imagine . Fiat justitia , ruat coelum , is not to be taken in a literal sense by statesmen , whose problem is to get justice done with as little jar as possible to existing order , which has at least so much of heaven in it that it is not chaos . Our first duty toward our enslaved brother is to educate him , whether he be white or black . The first need of the free black is to elevate himself according to the standard of this material generation . So soon as the Ethiopian goes in his chariot , he will find not only Apostles , but Chief Priests and Scribes and Pharisees willing to ride with him .</p>

     <p>As I write , comes the news of our disaster at Hampton Roads . I do not understand the supineness which , after fair warning , leaves wood to an unequal conflict with iron . It is not enough merely to have the right on our side , if we stick to the old flint-lock of tradition . I have observed in my parochial experience ( haud ignarus mali ) that the Devil is prompt to adopt the latest inventions of destructive warfare , and may thus take even such a three-decker as Bishop Butler at an advantage . It is curious , that , as gunpowder made armour useless on shore , so armour is having its revenge by baffling its old enemy at sea ; and that , while gunpowder robbed land warfare of nearly all its picturesqueness to give even greater stateliness and sublimity to a sea-fight , armour bids fair to degrade the latter into a squabble between two iron-shelled turtles .</p>

      <head>SPEECH OF HONOURABLE PRESERVED DOE IN SECRET CAUCUS</head>
      <head>TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY</head>
       <l n="1">JAALAM , 12th April , 1862 .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>GENTLEMEN ,— As I cannot but hope that the ultimate , if not speedy , success of the national arms is now sufficiently ascertained , sure as I am of the righteousness of our cause and its consequent claim on the blessing of God , ( for I would not show a faith inferior to that of the Pagan historian with his Facile evenit quod Dis cordi est ,) it seems to me a suitable occasion to withdraw our minds a moment from the confusing din of battle to objects of peaceful and permanent interest . Let us not neglect the monuments of preterite history because what shall be history is so diligently making under our eyes . Cras ingens iterabimus æquor ; to-morrow will be time enough for that stormy sea ; to-day let me engage the attention of your readers with the Runick inscription to whose fortunate discovery I have heretofore alluded . Well may we say with the poet , Multa renascuntur quæ jam cecidere . And I would premise , that , although I can no longer resist the evidence of my own senses from the stone before me to the ante-Columbian discovery of this continent by the Northmen , gens inclytissima , as they are called in a Palermitan inscription , written fortunately in a less debatable character than that which I am about to decipher , yet I would by no means be understood as wishing to vilipend the merits of the great Genoese , whose name will never be forgotten so long as the inspiring strains of ‘ Hail Columbia ’ shall continue to be heard . Though he must be stripped also of whatever praise may belong to the experiment of the egg , which I find proverbially attributed by Castilian authors to a certain Juanito or Jack , ( perhaps an offshoot of our giant-killing mythus ,) his name will still remain one of the most illustrious of modern times . But the impartial historian owes a duty likewise to obscure merit , and my solicitude to render a tardy justice is perhaps quickened by my having known those who , had their own field of labour been less secluded , might have found a readier acceptance with the reading publick , I could give an example , but I forbear : forsitan nostris ex ossibus oritur ultor .</p>
     <p>Touching Runick inscriptions , I find that they may lie classed under three general heads ; 1º . Those which are understood by the Danish Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries , and Professor Rafn , their Secretary ; 2º . Those which are comprehensible only by Mr. Rafn ; and 3º . Those which neither the Society , Mr. Rafn , nor anybody else can be said in any definite sense to understand , and which accordingly offer peculiar temptations to enucleating sagacity . These last are naturally deemed the most valuable by intelligent antiquaries , and to this class the stone now in my possession fortunately belongs . Such give a picturesque variety to ancient events , because susceptible oftentimes of as many interpretations as there are individual archæologists ; and since facts are only the pulp in which the Idea or event-seed is softly imbedded till it ripen , it is of little consequence what colour or flavour we attribute to them , provided it be agreeable . Availing myself of the obliging assistance of Mr. Arphaxad Bowers , an ingenious photographick artist , whose house-on-wheels has now stood for three years on our Meeting-House Green , with the somewhat contradictory inscription ,— ‘ our motto is onward , ’ — I have sent accurate copies of my treasure to many learned men and societies , both native and European . I may hereafter communicate their different and ( me judice ) equally erroneous solutions . I solicit also , Messrs . Editors , your own acceptance of the copy herewith enclosed . I need only premise further , that the stone itself is a goodly block of metamorphick sandstone , and that the Runes resemble very nearly the ornithichnites or fossil bird-tracks of Dr. Hitchcock , but with less regularity or apparent design than is displayed by those remarkable geological monuments . These are rather the non bene junctarum discordia semina rerum . Resolved to leave no door open to cavil , I first of all attempted the elucidation of this remarkable example of lithick literature by the ordinary modes , but with no adequate return for my labour . I then considered myself amply justified in resorting to that heroick treatment the felicity of which , as applied by the great Bentley to Milton , had long ago enlisted my admiration . Indeed , I had already made up my mind , that , in case good fortune should throw any such invaluable record in my way , I would proceed with it in the following simple and satisfactory method . Alter a cursory examination , merely sufficing for an approximative estimate of its length , I would write down a hypothetical inscription based upon antecedent probabilities , and then proceed to extract from the characters engraven on the stone a meaning as nearly as possible conformed to this a priori product of my own ingenuity . The result more than justified my hopes , inasmuch as the two inscriptions were made without any great violence to tally in all essential particulars . I then proceeded , not without some anxiety , to my second test , which was , to read the Runick letters diagonally , and again with the same success . With an excitement pardonable under the circumstances , yet tempered with thankful humility , I now applied my last and severest trial , my experimentum crucis . I turned the stone , now doubly precious in my eyes , with scrupulous exactness upside down . The physical exertion so far displaced my spectacles as to derange for a moment the focus of vision . I confess that it was with some tremulousness that I readjusted them upon my nose , and prepared my mind to bear with calmness any disappointment that might ensue . But , O albo dies notanda lapillo ! what was my delight to find that the change of position had effected none in the sense of the writing , even by so much as a single letter ! I was now , and justly , as I think , satisfied of the conscientious exactness of my interpretation . It is as follows :</p>
     <p>HERE BJARNA GRIMOLFSSON FIRST DRANK CLOUD-BROTHER THROUGH CHILD-OF-LAND-AND-WATER :</p>
     <p>that is , drew smoke through a reed stem . In other words , we have here a record of the first smoking of the herb Nicotiana Tabacum by an European on this continent . The probable results of this discovery are so vast as to baffle conjecture . If it be objected , that the smoking of a pipe would hardly justify the setting up of a memorial stone , I answer , that even now the Moquis Indian , ere he takes his first whiff , bows reverently toward the four quarters of the sky in succession , and that the loftiest monuments have been read to perpetuate fame , which is the dream of the shadow of smoke . The Saga , it will be remembered , leaves this Bjarna to a fate something like that of Sir Humphrey Gilbert , on board a sinking ship in the ‘ wormy sea , ’ having generously given up his place in the boat to a certain Icelander . It is doubly pleasant , therefore , to meet with this proof that the brave old man arrived safely in Vinland , and that his declining years were cheered by the respectful attentions of the dusky denizens of our then uninvaded forest . Most of all was I gratified , however , in thus linking forever the name of my native town with one of the most momentous occurrences of modern times . Hitherto Jalaam , though in soil , climate , and geographical position as highly qualified to be the theatre of remarkable historical incidents as any spot on the earth 's surface , has been , if I may say it without seeming to question the wisdom of Providence , almost maliciously neglected , as it might appear , by occurrences of world-wide interest in want of a situation . And in matters of this nature it must be confessed that adequate events are as necessary as the vates sacer to record them . Jaalam stood always modestly ready , but circumstances made no fitting response to her generous intentions . Now , however , she assumes her place on the historick roll . I have hitherto been a zealous opponent of the Circean herb , but I shall now reëxamine the question without bias .</p>
     <p>I am aware that the Rev . Jonas Tutchel , in a recent communication to the ‘ Bogus Four Corners Weekly Meridian , ’ has endeavored to show that this is the sepulchral inscription of Thorwald Eriksson , who , as is well-known , was slain in Vinland by the natives . But I think he has been misled by a preconceived theory , and cannot but feel that he has thus made an ungracious return for my allowing him to inspect the stone with the aid of my own glasses ( he having by accident left his at home ) and in my own study . The heathen ancients might have instructed this Christian minister in the rites of hospitality ; but much is to be pardoned to the spirit of self-love . He must indeed be ingenious who can make out the words hèr hvilir from any characters in the inscription in question , which , whatever else it may be , is certainly not mortuary . And even should the reverend gentleman succeed in persuading some fantastical wits of the soundness of his views , I do not see what useful end he will have gained . For if the English Courts of Law hold the testimony of gravestones from the burial-grounds of Protestant dissenters to be questionable , even where it is essential in proving a descent , I cannot conceive that the epitaphial assertions of heathens should be esteemed of more authority by any man of orthodox sentiments .</p>
     <p>At this moment , happening to cast my eyes upon the stone , whose characters a transverse light from my southern window brings out with singular distinctness , another interpretation has occurred to me , promising even more interesting results . I hasten to close my letter in order to follow at once the clue thus providentially suggested .</p>
     <p>I inclose , as usual , a contribution from Mr. Biglow , and remain ,</p>
     <p>Gentlemen , with esteem and respect ,</p>
     <p>Your Obedient Humble Servant ,</p>

      <head>SUNTHIN ’ IN THE PASTORAL LINE</head>
      <head>TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY</head>
       <l n="1">JAALAM , 17th May , 1862 .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>GENTLEMEN ,— At the special request of Mr. Biglow , I intended to inclose , together with his own contribution , ( into which , at my suggestion , he has thrown a little more of pastoral sentiment than usual ,) some passages from my sermon on the day of the National Fast , from the text , ‘ Remember them that are in bonds , as bound with them , ’ Heb . xiii , 3 . But I have not leisure sufficient at present for the copying of them , even were I altogether satisfied with the production as it stands . I should prefer , I confess , to contribute the entire discourse to the pages of your respectable miscellany , if it should be found acceptable upon perusal , especially as I find the difficulty in selection of greater magnitude than I had anticipated . What passes without challenge in the fervour of oral delivery , cannot always stand the colder criticism of the closet . I am not so great an enemy of Eloquence as my friend Mr. Biglow would appear to be from some passages in his contribution for the current month . I would not , indeed , hastily suspect him of covertly glancing at myself in his somewhat caustick animadversions , albeit some of the phrases he girds at are not entire strangers to my lips . I am a more hearty admirer of the Puritans than seems now to be the fashion , and believe , that , if they Hebraized a little too much in their speech , they showed remarkable practical sagacity as statesmen and founders . But such phenomena as Puritanism are the results rather of great religious than of merely social convulsions , and do not long survive them . So soon as an earnest conviction has cooled into a phrase , its work is over , and the best that can be done with it is to bury it . Ite , missa est . I am inclined to agree with Mr. Biglow that we cannot settle the great political questions which are now presenting themselves to the nation by the opinions of Jeremiah or Ezekiel as to the wants and duties of the Jews in their time , nor do I believe that an entire community with their feelings and views would be practicable or even agreeable at the present day . At the same time I could wish that their habit of subordinating the actual to the moral , the flesh to the spirit , and this world to the other , were more common . They had found out , at least , the great military secret that soul weighs more than body .— But I am suddenly called to a sick-bed in the household of a valued parishioner .</p>
     <p>With esteem and respect ,</p>
     <p>Your obedient servant ,</p>

     <p>LATEST VIEWS OF MR. BIGLOW</p>
     <p>PRELIMINARY NOTE</p>
     <p>[ It is with feelings of the liveliest pain that we inform our readers of the death of the Reverend Homer Wilbur , A. M ., which took place suddenly , by an apoplectic stroke , on the afternoon of Christmas day , 1862 . Our venerable friend ( for so we may venture to call him , though we never enjoyed the high privilege of his personal acquaintance ) was in his eighty-fourth year , having been born June 12 , 1779 , at Pigsgusset Precinct ( now West Jerusha ) in the then District of Maine . Graduated with distinction at Hubville College in 1805 , he pursued his theological studies with the late Reverend Preserved Thacker , D. D ., and was called to the charge of the First Society in Jaalam in 1809 , where he remained till his death .</p>
     <p>‘ As an antiquary he has probably left no superior , if , indeed , an equal , ’ writes his friend and colleague , the Reverend Jeduthun Hitchcock , to whom we are indebted for the above facts ; ‘ in proof of which I need only allude to his “ History of Jaalam , Genealogical , Topographical , and Ecclesiastical , ” 1849 , which has won him an eminent and enduring place in our more solid and useful literature . It is only to be regretted that his intense application to historical studies should have so entirely withdrawn him from the pursuit of poetical composition , for which he was endowed by Nature with a remarkable aptitude . His well-known hymn , beginning “ With clouds of care encompassed round , ” has been attributed in some collections to the late President Dwight , and it is hardly presumptuous to affirm that the simile of the rainbow in the eighth stanza would do no discredit to that polished pen . ’</p>
     <p>We regret that we have not room at present for the whole of Mr. Hitchcock 's exceedingly valuable communication . We hope to lay more liberal extracts from it before our readers at an early day . A summary of its contents will give some notion of its importance and interest . It contains : 1st , A biographical sketch of Mr. Wilbur , with notices of his predecessors in the pastoral office , and of eminent clerical contemporaries ; 2d , An obituary of deceased , from the Punkin-Falls ‘ Weekly Parallel ; ’ 3d , A list of his printed and manuscript productions and of projected works ; 4th , Personal anecdotes and recollections , with specimens of table-talk ; 5th , A tribute to his relict , Mrs. Dorcas ( Pilcox ) Wilbur ; 6th , A list of graduates fitted for different colleges by Mr. Wilbur , with biographical memoranda touching the more distinguished ; 7th , Concerning learned , charitable , and other societies , of which Mr. Wilbur was a member , and of those with which , had his life been prolonged , he would doubtless have been associated , with a complete catalogue of such Americans as have been Fellows of the Royal Society ; 8th , A brief summary of Mr. Wilbur 's latest conclusions concerning the Tenth Horn of the Beast in its special application to recent events , for which the public , as Mr. Hitchcock assures us , have been waiting with feelings of lively anticipation ; 9th , Mr. Hitchcock 's own views on the same topic ; and , 10th , A brief essay on the importance of local histories . It will be apparent that the duty of preparing Mr. Wilbur 's biography could not have fallen into more sympathetic hands .</p>
     <p>In a private letter with which the reverend gentleman has since favored us , he expresses the opinion that Mr. Wilbur 's life was shortened by our unhappy civil war . It disturbed his studies , dislocated all his habitual associations and trains of thought , and unsettled the foundations of a faith , rather the result of habit than conviction , in the capacity of man for self-government . ‘ Such has been the felicity of my life , ’ he said to Mr. Hitchcock , on the very morning of the day he died , ‘ that , through the divine mercy , I could always say , Summum nec metuo diem , nec opto . It has been my habit , as you know , on every recurrence of this blessed anniversary , to read Milton 's “ Hymn of the Nativity ” till its sublime harmonies so dilated my soul and quickened its spiritual sense that I seemed to hear that other song which gave assurance to the shepherds that there was One who would lead them also in green pastures and beside the still waters . But to-day I have been unable to think of anything but that mournful text , “ I came not to send peace , but a sword , ” and , did it not smack of Pagan presumptuousness , could almost wish I had never lived to see this day . ’</p>
     <p>Mr. Hitchcock also informs us that his friend ‘ lies buried in the Jaalam graveyard , under a large red-cedar which he specially admired . A neat and substantial monument is to be erected over his remains , with a Latin epitaph written by himself ; for he was accustomed to say , pleasantly , “ that there was at least one occasion in a scholar 's life when he might show the advantages of a classical training . " ’</p>
     <p>The following fragment of a letter addressed to us , and apparently intended to accompany Mr. Biglow 's contribution to the present number , was found upon his table after his decease .— EDITORS ATLANTIC MONTHLY . ]</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>TO THE EDITORS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY</head>
       <l n="1">JAALAM , 24th Dec ., 1862 .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>RESPECTED SIRS ,— -  The infirm state of my bodily health would be a sufficient apology for not taking up the pen at this time , wholesome as I deem it for the mind to apricate in the shelter of epistolary confidence , were it not that a considerable , I might even say a large , number of individuals in this parish expect from their pastor some publick expression of sentiment at this crisis . Moreover , Qui tacitus ardet magis uritur . In trying times like these , the besetting sin of undisciplined minds is to seek refuge from inexplicable realities in the dangerous stimulant of angry partisanship or the indolent narcotick of vague and hopeful vaticination : fortunamque suo temperat arbitrio . Both by reason of my age and my natural temperament , I am unfitted for either . Unable to penetrate the inscrutable judgments of God , I am more than ever thankful that my life has been prolonged till I could in some small measure comprehend His mercy . As there is no man who does not at some time render himself amenable to the one ,— quum vix justus sit securus ,— so there is none that does not feel himself in daily need of the other .</p>
     <p>I confess I cannot feel , as some do , a personal consolation for the manifest evils of this war in any remote or contingent advantages that may spring from it . I am old and weak , I can bear little , and can scarce hope to see better days ; nor is it any adequate compensation to know that Nature is young and strong and can bear much . Old men philosophize over the past , but the present is only a burthen and a weariness . The one lies before them like a placid evening landscape ; the other is full of vexations and anxieties of housekeeping . It may be true enough that miscet hæc illis , prohibetque Clotho fortunam stare , but he who said it was fain at last to call in Atropos with her shears before her time ; and I cannot help selfishly mourning that the fortune of our Republick could not at least stay till my days were numbered .</p>
     <p>Tibullus would find the origin of wars in the great exaggeration of riches , and does not stick to say that in the days of the beechen trencher there was peace . But averse as I am by nature from all wars , the more as they have been especially fatal to libraries , I would have this one go on till we are reduced to wooden platters again , rather than surrender the principle to defend which it was undertaken . Though I believe Slavery to have been the cause of it , by so thoroughly demoralizing Northern politicks for its own purposes as to give opportunity and hope to treason , yet I would not have our thought and purpose diverted from their true object ,— the maintenance of the idea of Government . We are not merely suppressing an enormous riot , but contending for the possibility of permanent order coexisting with democratical fickleness ; and while I would not superstitiously venerate form to the sacrifice of substance , neither would I forget that an adherence to precedent and prescription can alone give that continuity and coherence under a democratical constitution which are inherent in the person of a despotick monarch and the selfishness of an aristocratieal class . Stet pro ratione voluntas is as dangerous in a majority as in a tyrant .</p>
     <p>I cannot allow the present production of my young friend to go out without a protest from me against a certain extremeness in his views , more pardonable in the poet than in the philosopher . While I agree with him , that the only cure for rebellion is suppression by force , yet I must animadvert upon certain phrases where I seem to see a coincidence with a popular fallacy on the subject of compromise . On the one hand there are those who do not see that the vital principle of Government and the seminal principle of Law cannot properly be made a subject of compromise at all , and on the other those who are equally blind to the truth that without a compromise of individual opinions , interests , and even rights , no society would be possible . In medio tutissimus . For my own part , I would gladly —</p>

     <p>KETTELOPOTOMACHIA</p>
     <p>PRELIMINARY MOTE</p>
     <p>[ In the month of February , 1866 , the editors of the ‘ Atlantic Monthly ’ received from the Rev . Mr. Hitchcock of Jaalam a letter enclosing the macaronic verses which follow , and promising to send more , if more should be communicated . ‘ They were rapped out on the evening of Thursday last past , ’ he says , ‘ by what claimed to be the spirit of my late predecessor in the ministry here , the Rev . Dr. Wilbur , through the medium of a young man at present domiciled in my family . As to the possibility of such spiritual manifestations , or whether they be properly so entitled , I express no opinion , as there is a division of sentiment on that subject in the parish , and many persons of the highest respectability in social standing entertain opposing views . The young man who was improved as a medium submitted himself to the experiment with manifest reluctance , and is still unprepared to believe in the authenticity of the manifestations . During his residence with me his deportment has always been exemplary ; he has been constant in his attendance upon our family devotions and the public ministrations of the Word , and has more than once privately stated to me , that the latter had often brought him under deep concern of mind . The table is an ordinary quadrupedal one , weighing about thirty pounds , three feet seven inches and a half in height , four feet square on the top , and of beech or maple , I am not definitely prepared to say which . It had once belonged to my respected predecessor , and had been , so far as I can learn upon careful inquiry , of perfectly regular and correct habits up to the evening in question . On that occasion the young man previously alluded to had been sitting with his hands resting carelessly upon it , while I read over to him at his request certain portions of my last Sabbath 's discourse . On a sudden the rappings , as they are called , commenced to render themselves audible , at first faintly , but in process of time more distinctly and with violent agitation of the table . The young man expressed himself both surprised and pained by the wholly unexpected , and , so far as he was concerned , unprecedented occurrence . At the earnest solicitation , however , of several who happened to be present , he consented to go on with the experiment , and with the assistance of the alphabet commonly employed in similar emergencies , the following communication was obtained and written down immediately by myself . Whether any , and if so , how much weight should be attached to it , I venture no decision . That Dr. Wilbur had sometimes employed his leisure in Latin versification I have ascertained to be the case , though all that has been discovered of that nature among his papers consists of some fragmentary passages of a version into hexameters of portions of the Song of Solomon . These I had communicated about a week or ten days previous [ ly ] to the young gentleman who officiated as medium in the communication afterwards received . I have thus , I believe , stated all the material facts that have any elucidative bearing upon this mysterious occurrence . ’</p>
     <p>So far Mr. Hitchcock , who seems perfectly master of Webster 's unabridged quarto , and whose flowing style leads him into certain farther expatiations for which we have not room . We have since learned that the young man he speaks of was a sophomore , put under his care during a sentence of rustication from —— College , where he had distinguished himself rather by physical experiments on the comparative power of resistance in window-glass to various solid substances , than in the more regular studies of the place . In answer to a letter of inquiry , the professor of Latin says , ‘ There was no harm in the boy that I know of beyond his loving mischief more than Latin , nor can I think of any spirits likely to possess him except those commonly called animal . He was certainly not remarkable for his Latinity , but I see nothing in the verses you enclose that would lead me to think them beyond his capacity , or the result of any special inspiration whether of beech or maple . Had that of birch been tried upon him earlier and more faithfully , the verses would perhaps have been better in quality and certainly in quantity . ’ This exact and thorough scholar then goes on to point out many false quantities and barbarisms . It is but fair to say , however , that the author , whoever he was , seems not to have been unaware of some of them himself , as is shown by a great many notes appended to the verses as we received them , and purporting to be by Scaliger , Bentley , and others ,— among them the Esprit de Voltaire ! These we have omitted as clearly meant to be humorous and altogether failing therein .</p>
     <p>Though entirely satisfied that the verses are altogether unworthy of Mr. Wilbur , who seems to Slave been a tolerable Latin scholar after the fashion of his day , yet we have determined to print them here , partly as belonging to the res gestæ of this collection , and partly as a warning to their putative author which may keep him from such indecorous pranks for the future . ]</p>

     <note>The Editors of the ‘ Atlantic ’ have received so many letters of inquiry concerning the literary remains of the late Mr. Wilbur , mentioned by his colleague and successor , Rev . Jeduthun Hitchcock , in a communication from which we made some extracts in our number for February , 1863 , and have been so repeatedly urged to print some part of them for the gratification of the public , that they felt it their duty at least to make some effort to satisfy so urgent a demand . They have accordingly carefully examined the papers intrusted to them , but find most of the productions of Mr. Wilbur 's pen so fragmentary , and even chaotic , written as they are on the backs of letters in an exceedingly cramped chirography ,— here a memorandum for a sermon ; there an observation of the weather ; now the measurement of an extraordinary head of cabbage , and then of the cerebral capacity of some reverend brother deceased ; a calm inquiry into the state of modern literature , ending in a method of detecting if milk be impoverished with water , and the amount thereof ; one leaf beginning with a genealogy , to be interrupted halfway down with an entry that the brindle cow had calved ,— that any attempts at selection seemed desperate . His only complete work , ‘ An Enquiry concerning the Tenth Horn of the Beast , ’ even in the abstract of it given by Mr. Hitchcock , would , by a rough computation of the printers , fill five entire numbers of our journal , and as he attempts , by a new application of decimal fractions , to identify it with the Emperor Julian , seems hardly of immediate concern to the general reader . Even the Table-Talk , though doubtless originally highly interesting in the domestic circle , is so largely made up of theological discussion and matters of local or preterite interest , that we have found it hard to extract anything that would at all satisfy expectation . But , in order to silence further inquiry , we subjoin a few passages as illustrations of its general character .</note>
     <p>I think I could go near to be a perfect Christian if I were always a visitor , as I have sometimes been , at the house of some hospitable friend . I can show a great deal of self-denial where the best of everything is urged upon me with kindly importunity . It is not so very hard to turn the other cheek for a kiss . And when I meditate upon the pains taken for our entertainment in this life , on the endless variety of seasons , of human character and fortune , on the costliness of the hangings and furniture of our dwelling here , I sometimes feel a singular joy in looking upon myself as God 's guest , and cannot but believe that we should all be wiser and happier , because more grateful , if we were always mindful of our privilege in this regard . And should we not rate more cheaply any honor that men could pay us , if we remembered that every day we sat at the table of the Great King ? Yet must we not forget that we are in strictest bonds His servants also ; for there is no impiety so abject as that which expects to be deadheaded ( ut ita dicam ) through life , and which , calling itself trust in Providence , is in reality asking Providence to trust us and taking up all our goods on false pretences . It is a wise rule to take the world as we find it , not always to leave it so .</p>
     <p>It has often set me thinking when I find that I can always pick up plenty of empty nuts under my shagbark-tree . The squirrels know them by their lightness , and I have seldom seen one with the marks of their teeth in it . What a school-house is the world , if our wits would only not play truant ! For I observe that men set most store by forms and symbols in proportion as they are mere shells . It is the outside they want and not the kernel . What stores of such do not many , who in material things are as shrewd as the squirrels , lay up for the spiritual winter-supply of themselves and their children ! I have seen churches that seemed to me garners of these withered nuts , for it is wonderful how prosaic is the apprehension of symbols by the minds of most men . It is not one sect nor another , but all , who , like the dog of the fable , have let drop the spiritual substance of symbols for their material shadow . If one attribute miraculous virtues to mere holy water , that beautiful emblem of inward purification at the door of God 's house , another cannot comprehend the significance of baptism without being ducked over head and ears in the liquid vehicle thereof .</p>
     <note>Perhaps a word of historical comment may be permitted here . My late reverend predecessor was , I would humbly affirm , as free from prejudice as falls to the lot of the most highly favored individuals of our species . To be sure , I have heard Him say that ‘ what were called strong prejudices were in fact only the repulsion of sensitive organizations from that moral and even physical effluvium through which some natures by providential appointment , like certain unsavory quadrupeds , gave warning of their neighborhood . Better ten mistaken suspicions of this kind than one close encounter . ’ This he said somewhat in heat , on being questioned as to his motives for always refusing his pulpit to those itinerant professors of vicarious benevolence who end their discourses by taking up a collection . But at another time I remember his saying , ‘ that there was one large thing which small minds always found room for , and that was great prejudices . ’ This , however , by the way . The statement which I purposed to make was simply this . Down to A. D. 1830 , Jaalam had consisted of a single parish , with one house set apart for religions services . In that year the foundations of a Baptist Society were laid by the labors of Elder Joash Q. Balcom , 2d . As the members of the new body were drawn from the First Parish , Mr. Wilbur was for a time considerably exercised in mind . He even went so far as on one occasion to follow the reprehensible practice of the earlier Puritan divines in choosing a punning text , and preached from Hebrews xiii , 9 : ‘ Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines . ’ He afterwards , in accordance with one of his own maxims ,— ‘ to get a dead injury out of the mind as soon as is decent , bury it , and then ventilate , ’ — in accordance with this maxim , I say , he lived on very friendly terms with Rev . Shearjashub Scrimgour , present pastor of the Baptist Society in Jaalam . Yet I think it was never unpleasing to him that the church edifice of that society ( though otherwise a creditable specimen of architecture ) remained without a bell , as indeed it does to this day . So much seemed necessary to do away with any appearance of acerbity toward a respectable community of professing Christians , which might be suspected in the conclusion of the above paragraph .— J. H .</note>
     <p>In lighter moods he was not averse from an innocent play upon words . Looking up from his newspaper one morning , as I entered his study , he said , ‘ When I read a debate in Congress , I feel as if I were sitting at the feet of Zeno in the shadow of the Portico . ’ On my expressing a natural surprise , he added , smiling , ‘ Why , at such times the only view which honorable members give me of what goes on in the world is through their intercalumniations . ’ I smiled at this after a moment 's reflection , and he added gravely , ‘ The most punctilious refinement of manners is the only salt that will keep a democracy from stinking ; and what are we to expect from the people , if their representatives set them such lessons ? Mr. Everett 's whole life has been a sermon from this text . There was , at least , this advantage in duelling , that it set a certain limit on the tongue . When Society laid by the rapier , it buckled on the more subtle blade of etiquette wherewith to keep obtrusive vulgarity at bay . ’ In this connection , I may be permitted to recall a playful remark of his upon another occasion . The painful divisions in the First Parish , A. D. 1844 , occasioned by the wild notions in respect to the rights of ( what Mr. Wilbur , so far as concerned the reasoning faculty , always called ) the unfairer part of creation , put forth by Miss Parthenia Almira Fitz , are too well known to need more than a passing allusion . It was during these heats , long since happily allayed , that Mr. Wilbur remarked that ‘ the Church had more trouble in dealing with one sheresiarch than with twenty heresiarchs , ’ and that the men 's conscia recti , or certainty of being right , was nothing to the women 's .</p>
     <p>When I once asked his opinion of a poetical composition on which I had expended no little pains , he read it attentively , and then remarked ‘ Unless one 's thought pack more neatly in verse than in prose , it is wiser to refrain . Commonplace gains nothing by being translated into rhyme , for it is something which no hocus-pocus can transubstantiate with the real presence of living thought . You entitle your piece , “ My Mother 's Grave , ” and expend four pages of useful paper in detailing your emotions there . But , my dear sir , watering does not improve the quality of ink , even though you should do it with tears . To publish a sorrow to Tom , Dick , and Harry is in some sort to advertise its unreality , for I have observed in my intercourse with the afflicted that the deepest grief instinctively hides its face with its hands and is silent . If your piece were printed , I have no doubt it would be popular , for people like to fancy that they feel much better than the trouble of feeling . I would put all poets on oath whether they have striven to say everything they possibly could think of , or to leave out all they could not help saying . In your own case , my worthy young friend , what you have written is merely a deliberate exercise , the gymnastic of sentiment . For your excellent maternal relative is still alive , and is to take tea with me this evening , D. V . Beware of simulated feeling ; it is hypocrisy 's first cousin ; it is especially dangerous to a preacher ; for he who says one day , “ Go to , let me seem to be pathetic , ” may be nearer than he thinks to saying , “ Go to , let me seem to be virtuous , or earnest , or under sorrow for sin . ” Depend upon it , Sappho loved her verses more sincerely than she did Phaon , and Petrarch his sonnets better than Laura , who was indeed but his poetical stalking-horse . After you shall have once heard that muffled rattle of clods on the coffin-lid of an irreparable loss , you will grow acquainted with a pathos that will make all elegies hateful . When I was of your age , I also for a time mistook my desire to write verses for an authentic call of my nature in that direction . But one day as I was going forth for a walk , with my head full of an “ Elegy on the Death of Flirtilla , ” and vainly groping after a rhyme for lily that should not be silly or chilly , I saw my eldest boy Homer busy over the rain-water hogshead , in that childish experiment at parthenogenesis , the changing a horse-hair into a water-snake . All immersion of six weeks showed no change in the obstinate filament . Here was a stroke of unintended sarcasm . Had I not been doing in my study precisely what my boy was doing out of doors ? Had my thoughts any more chance of coming to life by being submerged in rhyme than his hair by soaking in water ? I burned my elegy and took a course of Edwards on the Will . People do not make poetry ; it is made out of them by a process for which I do not find myself fitted . Nevertheless , the writing of verses is a good rhetorical exercitation , as teaching us what to shun most carefully in prose . For prose bewitched is like window-glass with bubbles in it , distorting what it should show with pellucid veracity . ’</p>
     <p>It is unwise to insist on doctrinal points as vital to religion . The Bread of Life is wholesome and sufficing in itself , but gulped down with these kickshaws cooked up by theologians , it is apt to produce an indigestion , nay , eyen at last an incurable dyspepsia of scepticism .</p>
     <p>One of the most inexcusable weaknesses of Americans is in signing their names to what are called credentials . But for my interposition , a person who shall be nameless would have taken from this town a recommendation for an office of trust subscribed by the selectmen and all the voters of both parties , ascribing to him as many good qualities as if it had been his tombstone . The excuse was that it would be well for the town to be rid of him , as it would erelong be obliged to maintain him . I would not refuse my name to modest merit , but I would be as cautious as in signing a bond . [ I trust I shall be subjected to no imputation of unbecoming vanity , if I mention the fact that Mr. W. indorsed my own qualifications as teacher of the high-school at Pequash Junction . J. H . ] When I see a certificate of character with everybody 's name to it , I regard it as a letter of introduction from the Devil . Never give a man your name unless you are willing to trust him with your reputation .</p>
     <p>There seem nowadays to be two sources of literary inspiration ,— fulness of mind and emptiness of pocket .</p>
     <p>I am often struck , especially in reading Montaigne , with the obviousness and familiarity of a great writer 's thoughts , and the freshness they gain because said by him . The truth is , we mix their greatness with all they say and give it our best attention . Johannes Faber sic cogitavit would be no enticing preface to a book , but an accredited name gives credit like the signature to a note of hand . It is the advantage of fame that it is always privileged to take the world by the button , and a thing is weightier for Shakespeare 's uttering it by the whole amount of his personality .</p>
     <p>It is singular how impatient men are with overpraise of others , how patient with overpraise of themselves ; and yet the one does them no injury while the other may he their ruin .</p>
     <p>People are apt to confound mere alertness of mind with attention . The one is but the flying abroad of all the faculties to the open doors and windows at every passing rumor ; the other is the concentration of every one of them in a single focus , as in the alchemist over his alembic at the moment of expected projection . Attention is the stuff that memory is made of , and memory is accumulated genius .</p>
     <p>Do not look for the Millennium as imminent . One generation is apt to get all the wear it can out of the cast clothes of the last , and is always sure to use up every paling of the old fence that will hold a nail in building the new .</p>
     <p>You suspect a kind of vanity in my genealogical enthusiasm . Perhaps you are right ; but it is a universal foible . Where it does not show itself in a personal and private way , it becomes public and gregarious . We flatter ourselves in the Pilgrim Fathers , and the Virginian offshoot of a transported convict swells with the fancy ef a cavalier ancestry . Pride of birth , I have noticed , takes two forms . One complacently traces himself up to a coronet ; another , defiantly , to a lapstone . The sentiment is precisely the same in both cases , only that one is the positive and the other the negative pole of it .</p>
     <p>Seeing a goat the other day kneeling in order to graze with less trouble , it seemed to me a type of the common notion of prayer . Most people are ready enough to go down on their knees for material blessings , but how few for those spiritual gifts which alone are an answer to our orisons , if we but knew it !</p>
     <p>Some people , nowadays , seem to have hit upon a new moralization of the moth and the candle . They would lock up the light of Truth , lest poor Psyche should put it out in her effort to draw nigh , to it .</p>
     <p>No . X</p>

      <head>MR. HOSEA BIGLOW 'S SPEECH IN MARCH MEETING</head>
      <head>TO THE EDITOR OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY</head>
       <l n="1">JAALAM , April 5 , 1866 .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>MY DEAR SIR ,—</p>
     <p>( an ’ noticin ’ by your kiver thet you 're some dearer than wut you wuz , I enclose the deffrence ) I dunno ez I know Jest how to interdoose this las ’ perduction of my mews , ez Parson Wilber allus called ‘ em , which is goin ’ to be the last an ’ stay the last onless sunthin ’ pertikler sh 'd interfear which I do n't expec ’ ner I wu n't yield tu ef it wuz ez pressin ’ ez a deppity Shiriff . Sence Mr. Wilbur 's disease I hev n't hed no one thet could dror out my talons . He ust to kind o ’ wine me up an ’ set the penderlum agoin ’ an ’ then somehow I seemed to go on tick as it wear tell I run down , but the noo minister ai n't of the same brewin ’ nor I can n't seem to git ahold of no kine of huming nater in him but sort of slide rite off as you du on the eedge of a mow . Minnysteeril natur is wal enough an ’ a site better'n most other kines I know on , but the other sort sech as Welbor hed wuz of the Lord 's makin ’ an ’ naterally more wonderfle an ’ sweet tastin ’ leastways to me so fur as heerd from . He used to interdooce ‘ em smooth ez ile athout sayin ’ nothin ’ in pertickler an ’ I misdoubt he did n't set so much by the sec'nd Ceres as wut he done by the Fust , fact , he let on onct thet his mine misgive him of a sort of fallin ’ off in spots . He wuz as outspoken as a norwester he wuz , but I tole him I hoped the fall wuz from so high up thet a feller could ketch a good many times fust afore comin ’ bunt onto the ground as I see Jethro C. Swett from the meetin ’ house steeple up to th ’ old perrish , an ’ took up for dead but he 's alive now an ’ spry as wut you be . Turnin ’ of it over I recelected how they ust to put wut they called Argymunce onto the frunts of poymns , like poorches afore housen whare you could rest ye a spell whilst you wuz concludin ’ whether you 'd go in or nut espeshully ware tha wuz darters , though I most allus found it the best plen to go in fust an ’ think afterwards an ’ the gals likes it best tu . I dno as speechis ever hez any argimunts to ‘ em , I never see none thet hed an ’ I guess they never du but tha must allus be a B'ginnin ’ to everythin ’ athout it is Etarnity so I 'll begin rite away an ’ anybody may put it afore any of his speeches ef it soots an ’ welcome . I do n't claim no paytent .</p>
     <p>THE ARGYMUNT</p>
     <p>Interducshin , w'ich may be skipt . Begins by talkin ’ about himself : thet 's jest natur an ’ most gin'ally allus pleasin ’ , I b'leeve I 've notist , to one of the cumpany , an ’ thet 's more than wut you can say of most speshes of talkin ’ . Nex ’ comes the gittin ’ the goodwill of the orjunce by lettin ’ ‘ em gether from wut you kind of ex'dentally let drop thet they air about East , A one , an ’ no mistaik , skare ‘ em up an ’ take ‘ em as they rise . Spring interdooced with a fiew approput flours . Speach finally begins witch nobuddy need n't feel obolygated to read as I never read ‘ em an ’ never shell this one ag'in . Subjick staited ; expanded ; delayted ; extended . Pump lively . Subjick staited ag'in so 's to avide all mistaiks . Ginnle remarks ; continooed ; kerried on ; pushed furder ; kind o ’ gin out . Subjick restaited ; dielooted ; stirred up permiscoous . Pump ag'in . Gits back to where he sot out . Ca n't seem to stay thair . Ketches into Mr. Seaward 's hair . Breaks loose ag'in an ’ staits his subjick ; stretches it ; turns it ; folds it ; onfolds it ; folds it ag'in so 's't , no one can n't find it . Argoos with an imedginary bean thet ai n't aloud to say nothin ’ in replye . Gives him a real good dressin ’ an ’ is settysfide he 's rite . Gits into Johnson 's hair . No use tryin ’ to git into his head . Gives it up . Hez to stait his subjick ag'in ; doos it back'ards , sideways , eendways , criss-cross , bevellin ’ , noways . Gits finally red on it . Concloods . Concloods more . Reads some xtrax . Sees his subjick a-nosin ’ round arter him ag'in . Tries to avide it . Wu n't du . Misstates it . Ca n't conjectur ’ no other plawsable way of staytin ’ on it . Tries pump . No fx . Finely concloods to conclood . Yeels the flore .</p>
     <p>You kin spall an ’ punctooate thet as you please . I allus do , it kind of puts a noo soot of close onto a word , thisere funattick spellin ’ doos an ’ takes ‘ em out of the prissen dress they wair in the Dixonary . Ef I squeeze the cents out of ‘ em it 's the main thing , an ’ wut they wuz made for : wut 's left 's jest pummis .</p>
     <p>Mistur Wilbur sez he to me onct , sez he , ‘ Hosee , ’ sez he , ‘ in litterytoor the only good thing is Natur . It 's amazin ’ hard to come at , ’ sez he , ‘ but onct git it an ’ you 've gut everythin ’ . Wut 's the sweetest small on airth ? ’ sez he . ‘ Noomone hay , ’ sez I , pooty bresk , for he wuz allus hankerin ’ round in hayin ’ . ‘ Nawthin ’ of the kine , ’ sez he . ‘ My leetle Huldy 's breath , ’ sez I ag'in . ‘ You 're a good lad , ’ sez he , his eyes sort of ripplin ’ like , for he lost a babe onct nigh about her age ,— ‘ you 're a good lad ; but ‘ tai n't thet nuther , ’ sez he . ‘ Ef you want to know , ’ sez he , ‘ open your winder of a mornin ’ et ary season , and you 'll larn thet the best of perfooms is jest fresh air , fresh air , ’ sez he , emphysizin ’ , ‘ athout no mixtur . Thet 's wut I call natur in writin ’ , and it bathes my lungs and washes ‘ em sweet whenever I git a whiff on ‘ t . ’ sez he . I often think o ’ thet when I set down to write but the winders air so ept to git stuck , an ’ breakin ’ a pane costs sunthin ’ .</p>
     <p>Yourn for the last time ,</p>
     <p>Nut to be continooed ,</p>

       <l n="52">Still on these plains could breathe her mountain air ,</l>

       <l n="58">Strange dew in royal eyes grew round and bright ,</l>

       <l n="7">The figure of a woman veiled , that said ,</l>
       <l n="8">‘ My name is Duty , turn and follow me ; ’</l>
       <l n="9">Something there was that chilled me in her voice ;</l>
       <l n="10">I felt Youth 's hand grow slack and cold in mine , 10</l>
       <l n="11">As if to be withdrawn , and I exclaimed :</l>

       <l n="15">Hasting our youth away into the dark ;</l>
       <l n="16">These senses , quivering with electric heats ,</l>
       <l n="17">Too soon will show , like nests on wintry boughs</l>
       <l n="18">Obtrusive emptiness , too palpable wreck ,</l>
       <l n="19">Which whistling north-winds line with downy snow</l>
       <l n="20">Sometimes , or fringe with foliaged rime , in vain , 20</l>

       <l n="26">Warm as the whispering South that opens buds</l>

       <l n="28">‘ I am called Pleasure , come with me ! ’ she said ,</l>

       <l n="30">Nor only that , but , so it seemed , shook out 30</l>
       <l n="31">All memory too , and all the moonlit past ,</l>

       <l n="38">I only felt the hand within my own ,</l>
       <l n="39">Transmuting all my blood to golden fire ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="41">Suddenly shrank the hand ; suddenly burst</l>
       <l n="42">A cry that split the torpor of my brain ,</l>
       <l n="43">And as the first sharp thrust of lightning loosens</l>
       <l n="44">From the heaped cloud its rain , loosened my sense :</l>
       <l n="45">‘ Save me ! ’ it thrilled ; ‘ oh , hide me ! there is Death !</l>
       <l n="46">Death the divider , the unmerciful ,</l>

       <l n="57">Yet I toiled on , and , toiling on , I thought ,</l>
       <l n="58">‘ That way lies Youth , and Wisdom , and all Good ;</l>

       <l n="62">What the soul teaches profits to the soul ,</l>
       <l n="63">Which then first stands erect with Godward face ,</l>
       <l n="64">When she lets fall her pack of withered facts ,</l>
       <l n="65">The gleanings of the outward eye and ear ,</l>

       <l n="71">Stood forth and beckoned , and I followed now :</l>
       <l n="72">Down to no bower of roses led the path ,</l>

       <l n="74">Hewed wood for fires whose glow was owned and fenced ,</l>
       <l n="75">Where Nakedness wove garments of warm wool</l>
       <l n="76">Not for itself ;— or through the fields it led</l>
       <l n="77">Where Hunger reaped the unattainable grain ,</l>
       <l n="78">Where idleness enforced saw idle lands ,</l>
       <l n="79">Leagues of unpeopled soil , the common earth ,</l>
       <l n="80">Walled round with paper against God and Man . 80</l>
       <l n="81">‘ I cannot look , ’ I groaned , ‘ at only these ;</l>

      <head>BIÖRN 'S BECKONERS</head>
       <l n="1">Now Biörn , the son of Heriulf , had ill days</l>
       <l n="2">Because the heart within him seethed with blood</l>
       <l n="3">That would not be allayed with any toil ,</l>
       <l n="4">Whether of war or hunting or the oar ,</l>
       <l n="5">But was anhungered for some joy untried :</l>
       <l n="6">For the brain grew not weary with the limbs ,</l>
       <l n="7">But , while they slept , still hammered like a Troll ,</l>
       <l n="8">Building all night a bridge of solid dream</l>
       <l n="9">Between him and some purpose of his soul ,</l>
       <l n="10">Or will to find a purpose . With the dawn 10</l>
       <l n="11">The sleep-laid timbers , crumbled to soft mist ,</l>
       <l n="12">Denied all foothold . But the dream remained ,</l>
       <l n="13">And every night with yellow-bearded kings</l>
       <l n="14">His sleep was haunted ,— mighty men of old ,</l>
       <l n="15">Once young as he , now ancient like the gods ,</l>
       <l n="16">And safe as stars in all men 's memories .</l>
       <l n="17">Strange sagas read he in their sea-blue eyes</l>
       <l n="18">Cold as the sea , grandly compassionless ;</l>
       <l n="19">Like life , they made him eager and then mocked .</l>
       <l n="20">Nay , broad awake , they would not let him be ; 20</l>
       <l n="21">They shaped themselves gigantic in the mist ,</l>
       <l n="22">They rose far-beckoning in the lamps of heaven ,</l>
       <l n="23">They whispered invitation in the winds ,</l>
       <l n="24">And breath came from them , mightier than the wind ,</l>
       <l n="25">To strain the lagging sails of his resolve ,</l>
       <l n="26">Till that grew passion which before was wish ,</l>
       <l n="27">And youth seemed all too costly to be staked</l>
       <l n="28">On the soiled cards wherewith men played their game ,</l>
       <l n="29">Letting Time pocket up the larger life ,</l>
       <l n="30">Lost with base gain of raiment , food , and roof . 30</l>
       <l n="31">‘ What helpeth lightness of the feet ? ’ they said ,</l>
       <l n="32">‘ Oblivion runs with swifter foot than they ;</l>
       <l n="33">Or strength of sinew ? New men come as strong ,</l>
       <l n="34">And those sleep nameless ; or renown in war ?</l>
       <l n="35">Swords grave no name on the long-memoried rock</l>
       <l n="36">But moss shall hide it ; they alone who wring</l>
       <l n="37">Some secret purpose from the unwilling gods</l>
       <l n="38">Survive in song for yet a little while</l>
       <l n="39">To vex , like us , the dreams of later men ,</l>
       <l n="40">Ourselves a dream , and dreamlike all we did . ’ 40</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">So Biörn went comfortless but for his thought ,</l>
       <l n="2">And by his thought the more discomforted ,</l>
       <l n="3">Till Erle Thurlson kept his Yule-tide feast :</l>
       <l n="4">And thither came he , called among the rest ,</l>
       <l n="5">Silent , lone-minded , a church-door to mirth ;</l>
       <l n="6">But , ere deep draughts forbade such serious song</l>
       <l n="7">As the grave Skald might chant nor after blush ,</l>
       <l n="8">Then Eric looked at Thorwald where he sat</l>
       <l n="9">Mute as a cloud amid the stormy hall ,</l>
       <l n="10">And said : ‘ O Skald , sing now an olden song , 50</l>
       <l n="11">Such as our fathers heard who led great lives ;</l>
       <l n="12">And , as the bravest on a shield is borne</l>
       <l n="13">Along the waving host that shouts him king ,</l>
       <l n="14">So rode their thrones upon the thronging seas ! ’</l>
       <l n="15">Then the old man arose ; white-haired he stood ,</l>
       <l n="16">White-bearded , and with eyes that looked afar</l>
       <l n="17">From their still region of perpetual snow ,</l>
       <l n="18">Beyond the little smokes and stirs of men :</l>
       <l n="19">His head was bowed with gathered flakes of years ,</l>
       <l n="20">As winter bends the sea-foreboding pine , 60</l>
       <l n="21">But something triumphed in his brow and eye ,</l>
       <l n="22">Which whoso saw it could not see and crouch :</l>
       <l n="23">Loud rang the emptied beakers as he mused ,</l>
       <l n="24">Brooding his eyried thoughts ; then , as an eagle</l>
       <l n="25">Circles smooth-winged above the wind-vexed woods ,</l>
       <l n="26">So wheeled his soul into the air of song</l>
       <l n="27">High o'er the stormy hall ; and thus he sang :</l>
       <l n="28">‘ The fletcher for his arrow-shaft picks out</l>
       <l n="29">Wood closest-grained , long-seasoned , straight as light ;</l>
       <l n="30">And from a quiver full of such as these 70</l>
       <l n="31">The wary bowman , matched against his peers ,</l>
       <l n="32">Long doubting , singles yet once more the best .</l>
       <l n="33">Who is it needs such flawless shafts as Fate ?</l>
       <l n="34">What archer of his arrows is so choice ,</l>
       <l n="35">Or hits the white so surely ? They are men ,</l>
       <l n="36">The chosen of her quiver ; nor for her</l>
       <l n="37">Will every reed suffice , or cross-grained stick</l>
       <l n="38">At random from life 's vulgar fagot plucked :</l>
       <l n="39">Such answer household ends ; but she will have</l>
       <l n="40">Souls straight and clear , of toughest fibre , sound 80</l>
       <l n="41">Down to the heart of heart ; from these she strips</l>
       <l n="42">All needless stuff , all sapwood ; seasons them ;</l>
       <l n="43">From circumstance untoward feathers plucks</l>
       <l n="44">Crumpled and cheap ; and barbs with iron will :</l>
       <l n="45">The hour that passes is her quiver-boy :</l>
       <l n="46">When she draws bow , ‘ tis not across the wind ,</l>
       <l n="47">Nor ‘ gainst the sun her haste-snatched arrow sings ,</l>
       <l n="48">For sun and wind have plighted faith to her :</l>
       <l n="49">Ere men have heard the sinew twang , behold</l>

       <l n="54">Good were the days of yore , when men were tried</l>
       <l n="55">By ring of shields , as now by ring of words ;</l>
       <l n="56">But while the gods are left , and hearts of men ,</l>
       <l n="57">And wide-doored ocean , still the days are good .</l>
       <l n="58">Still o'er the earth hastes Opportunity ,</l>
       <l n="59">Seeking the hardy soul that seeks for her .</l>
       <l n="60">Be not abroad , nor deaf with household cares 100</l>
       <l n="61">That chatter loudest as they mean the least ;</l>

       <l n="69">Musing , and , with his eyes upon the fire ,</l>
       <l n="70">Saw shapes of arrows , lost as soon as seen . 110</l>
       <l n="71">‘ A ship , ’ he muttered ,' is a wingèd bridge</l>

       <l n="73">And ocean the wide gate to manful luck . ’</l>
       <l n="74">And then with that resolve his heart was bent ,</l>
       <l n="75">Which , like a humming shaft , through many a stripe</l>
       <l n="76">Of day and night , across the unpathwayed seas</l>

       <l n="1">Four weeks they sailed , a speck in sky-shut seas ,</l>

       <l n="63">How little I dreamed , as I tramped up and down ,</l>
       <l n="64">That granting our wish one of Fate 's saddest Jokes is !</l>
       <l n="65">I had mine with a vengeance ,— my king got his crown ,</l>

       <l n="93">‘ Tis so much less easy to do than to sing ,</l>
       <l n="94">So much simpler to reign by a proxy than be king !</l>
       <l n="95">Yes , I think I do see ; after all 's said and sung ,</l>
       <l n="96">Take this one rule of life and you never will rue it ,—</l>

      <head>Dr. Johnson 's sturdy self-respect led him to invent the Bookseller as a substitute for the Patron .

       <l n="8">Nor ever blurred with mist of afterthought ;</l>
       <l n="9">Like words made magical by poets dead ,</l>
       <l n="10">Wherein the music of all meaning is</l>
       <l n="11">The sense hath garnered or the soul divined , 10</l>
       <l n="12">They mingle with our life 's ethereal part ,</l>

       <l n="42">Who , seeing once , has truly seen again</l>
       <l n="43">The gray vague of unsympathizing sea</l>

       <l n="45">To shores inhospitable of eldest time ,</l>

       <l n="81">One morn of autumn lords it o'er the rest , 80</l>
       <l n="82">When in the lane I watched the ash-leaves fall ,</l>
       <l n="83">Balancing softly earthward without wind ,</l>
       <l n="84">Or twirling with directer impulse down</l>
       <l n="85">On those fallen yesterday , now barbed with frost ,</l>
       <l n="86">While I grew pensive with the pensive year :</l>
       <l n="87">And once I learned how marvellous winter was ,</l>
       <l n="88">When past the fence-rails , downy-gray with rime ,</l>

       <l n="101">That doubtfully revealed me to myself . 100</l>
       <l n="102">Thenceforward I must stand outside the gate ;</l>

        <l n="2">Entranced I saw a vision in the cloud</l>
        <l n="3">That loitered dreaming in yon sunset sky ,</l>
        <l n="4">Full of fair shapes , half creatures of the eye ,</l>
        <l n="5">Half chance-evoked by the wind 's fantasy</l>
        <l n="6">In golden mist , an ever-shifting crowd :</l>
        <l n="7">There , ‘ mid unreal forms that came and went</l>
        <l n="8">In air-spun robes , of evanescent dye ,</l>
        <l n="9">A woman 's semblance shone preeminent ;</l>
        <l n="10">Not armed like Pallas , not like Hera proud ,</l>
        <l n="11">But , as on household diligence intent , 10</l>
        <l n="12">Beside her visionary wheel she bent</l>
        <l n="13">Like Aretë or Bertha , nor than they</l>
        <l n="14">Less queenly in her port ; about her knee</l>
        <l n="15">Glad children clustered confident in play :</l>
        <l n="16">Placid her pose , the calm of energy ;</l>
        <l n="17">And over her broad brow in many a round</l>
        <l n="18">( That loosened would have gilt her garment 's hem ) ,</l>
        <l n="19">Succinct , as toil prescribes , the hair was wound</l>
        <l n="20">In lustrous coils , a natural diadem .</l>
        <l n="21">The cloud changed shape , obsequious to the whim 20</l>
        <l n="22">Of some transmuting influence felt in me ,</l>
        <l n="23">And , looking now , a wolf I seemed to see</l>
        <l n="24">Limned in that vapor , gaunt and hunger-bold ,</l>
        <l n="25">Threatening her charge ; resolve in every limb ,</l>
        <l n="26">Erect she flamed in mail of sun-wove gold ,</l>
        <l n="27">Penthesilea 's self for battle dight ;</l>
        <l n="28">One arm uplifted braced a flickering spear ,</l>
        <l n="29">And one her adamantine shield made light ;</l>
        <l n="30">Her face , helm-shadowed , grew a thing to fear ,</l>
        <l n="31">And her fierce eyes , by danger challenged , took 30</l>
        <l n="32">Her trident-sceptred mother 's dauntless look .</l>
        <l n="33">‘ I know thee now , O goddess-born ! ’ I cried ,</l>
        <l n="34">And turned with loftier brow and firmer stride ;</l>
        <l n="35">For in that spectral cloud-work I had seen</l>
        <l n="36">Her image , bodied forth by love and pride ,</l>
        <l n="37">The fearless , the benign , the mother-eyed ,</l>
        <l n="38">The fairer world 's toil-consecrated queen .</l>

       <l n="71">Knowing , what all experience serves to show ,</l>
       <l n="72">No mud can soil us but the mud we throw .</l>

       <l n="86">Dictates , for acquiescence dumb were sin ;</l>
       <l n="87">I blurt ungrateful truths , if so they be ,</l>
       <l n="88">That none may need to say them after me . 80</l>
       <l n="89">‘ Twere my felicity could I attain</l>
       <l n="90">The temperate zeal that balances your brain ;</l>
       <l n="91">But nature still o'erleaps reflection 's plan ,</l>
       <l n="92">And one must do his service as he can .</l>
       <l n="93">Think you it were not pleasanter to speak</l>
       <l n="94">Smooth words that leave unflushed the brow and cheek ?</l>
       <l n="95">To sit , well-dined , with cynic smile , unseen</l>
       <l n="96">In private box , spectator of the scene</l>
       <l n="97">Where men the comedy of life rehearse ,</l>
       <l n="98">Idly to judge which better and which worse 90</l>
       <l n="99">Each hireling actor spoiled his worthless part ?</l>
       <l n="100">Were it not sweeter with a careless heart ,</l>
       <l n="101">In happy commune with the untainted brooks ,</l>
       <l n="102">To dream all day , or , walled with silent books ,</l>
       <l n="103">To hear nor heed the World 's unmeaning noise ,</l>
       <l n="104">Safe in my fortress stored with lifelong joys ?</l>
       <l n="105">I love too well the pleasures of retreat</l>
       <l n="106">Safe from the crowd and cloistered from the street ;</l>
       <l n="107">The fire that whispers its domestic joy ,</l>
       <l n="108">Flickering on walls that knew me still a boy , 100</l>
       <l n="109">And knew my saintly father ; the full days ,</l>
       <l n="110">Not careworn from the world 's soul-squandering ways ,</l>
       <l n="111">Calm days that loiter with snow-silent tread ,</l>
       <l n="112">Nor break my commune with the undying dead ;</l>
       <l n="113">Truants of Time , to-morrow like to-day ,</l>
       <l n="114">That come unhid , and claimless glide away</l>
       <l n="115">By shelves that sun them in the indulgent Past ,</l>
       <l n="116">Where Spanish castles , even , were built to last ,</l>
       <l n="117">Where saint and sage their silent vigil keep ,</l>
       <l n="118">And wrong hath ceased or sung itself to sleep . 110</l>
       <l n="119">Dear were my walks , too , gathering fragrant store</l>
       <l n="120">Of Mother Nature 's simple-minded lore :</l>
       <l n="121">I learned all weather-signs of day or night ;</l>
       <l n="122">No bird but I could name him by his flight ,</l>
       <l n="123">No distant tree but by his shape was known ,</l>
       <l n="124">Or , near at hand , by leaf or bark alone .</l>
       <l n="125">This learning won by loving looks I hived</l>
       <l n="126">As sweeter lore than all from books derived .</l>
       <l n="127">I know the charm of hillside , field , and wood ,</l>
       <l n="128">Of lake and stream , and the sky 's downy brood , 120</l>
       <l n="129">Of roads sequestered rimmed with sallow sod ,</l>
       <l n="130">But friends with hardhack , aster , goldenrod ,</l>
       <l n="131">Or succory keeping summer long its trust</l>
       <l n="132">Of heaven-blue fleckless from the eddying dust :</l>
       <l n="133">These were my earliest friends , and latest too ,</l>
       <l n="134">Still unestranged , whatever fate may do .</l>
       <l n="135">For years I had these treasures , knew their worth ,</l>
       <l n="136">Estate most real man can have on earth .</l>
       <l n="137">I sank too deep in this soft-stuffed repose</l>
       <l n="138">That hears but rumors of earth 's wrongs and woes ; 130</l>
       <l n="139">Too well these Capuas could my muscles waste ,</l>
       <l n="140">Not void of toils , but toils of choice and taste ;</l>
       <l n="141">These still had kept me could I but have quelled</l>
       <l n="142">The Puritan drop that in my veins rebelled .</l>
       <l n="143">But there were times when silent were my books</l>
       <l n="144">As jailers are , and gave me sullen looks ,</l>
       <l n="145">When verses palled , and even the woodland path ,</l>
       <l n="146">By innocent contrast , fed my heart with wrath ,</l>
       <l n="147">And I must twist my little gift of words</l>
       <l n="148">Into a scourge of rough and knotted cords 140</l>
       <l n="149">Unmusical , that whistle as they swing</l>

   <note>POSTSCRIPT , 1887 Curtis , so wrote I thirteen years ago , Tost it unfinished by , and left it so ; Found lately , I have pieced it out , or tried , Since time for callid juncture was denied . Some of the verses pleased me , it is true , And still were pertinent ,— those honoring you . 200 These now I offer : take them , if you will , Like the old hand-grasp , when at Shady Hill We met , or Staten Island , in the days When life was its own spur , nor needed praise . If once you thought me rash , no longer fear ; Past my next milestone waits my seventieth year . I mount no longer when the trumpets call ; My battle-harness idles on the wall , The spider 's castle , camping-ground of dust , Not without dints , and all in front , I trust . 210 Shivering sometimes it calls me as it hears Afar the charge 's tramp and clash of spears ; But ‘ tis such murmur only as might be The sea-shell 's lost tradition of the sea , That makes me muse and wonder Where ? and When ? While from my cliff I watch the waves of men That climb to break midway their seeming gain , And think it triumph if they shake their chain . Little I ask of Fate ; will she refuse Some days of reconcilement with the Muse ? 220 I take my reed again and blow it free Of dusty silence , murmuring , ‘ Sing to me ! ’ And , as its stops my curious touch retries , The stir of earlier instincts I surprise ,— Instincts , if less imperious , yet more strong , And happy in the toil that ends with song . Home am I come : not , as I hoped might be , To the old haunts , too full of ghosts for me , But to the olden dreams that time endears , And the loved books that younger grow with years ; 230 To country rambles , timing with my tread Some happier verse that carols in my head , Yet all with sense of something vainly mist , Of something lost , but when I never wist . How empty seems to me the populous street , One figure gone I daily loved to meet ,— The clear , sweet singer with the crown of snow Not whiter than the thoughts that housed below ! And , ah , what absence feel I at my side , Like Dante when he missed his laurelled guide , 240 What sense of diminution in the air Once so inspiring , Emerson not there ! But life is sweet , though all that makes it sweet Lessen like sound of friends ’ departing feet , And Death is beautiful as feet of friend Coming with welcome at our journey 's end ; For me Fate gave , whate'er she else denied , A nature sloping to the southern side ; I thank her for it , though when clouds arise Such natures double-darken gloomy skies . 250 I muse upon the margin of the sea , Our common pathway to the new To Be , Watching the sails , that lessen more and more , Of good and beautiful embarked before ; With bits of wreck I patch the boat shall bear Me to that unexhausted Otherwhere , Whose friendly-peopled shore I sometimes see , By soft mirage uplifted , beckon me , Nor sadly hear , as lower sinks the sun , My moorings to the past snap one by one . 260 II . SENTIMENT ENDYMION A MYSTICAL COMMENT ON TITIAN 'S ‘ SACRED AND PROFANE LOVE ’ I My day began not till the twilight fell , And , lo , in ether from heaven 's sweetest well , The New Moon swam divinely isolate In maiden silence , she that makes my fate Haply not knowing it , or only so As I the secrets of my sheep may know ; Nor ask I more , entirely blest if she , In letting me adore , ennoble me To height of what the Gods meant making man , As only she and her best beauty can . 10 Mine be the love that in itself can find Seed of white thoughts , the lilies of the mind , Seed of that glad surrender of the will That finds in service self 's true purpose still : Love that in outward fairness sees the tent Pitched for an inmate far more excellent ; Love with a light irradiate to the core , Lit at her lamp , but fed from inborn store ; Love thrice-requited with the single joy Of an immaculate vision naught could cloy , 20 Dearer because , so high beyond my scope , My life grew rich with her , unbribed by hope Of other guerdon save to think she knew One grateful votary paid her all her due ; Happy if she , high-radiant there , resigned To his sure trust her image in his mind . O fairer even than Peace is when she comes Hushing War 's tumult , and retreating drums Fade to a murmur like the sough of bees Hidden among the noon-stilled linden-trees , 30 Bringer of quiet , thou that canst allay The dust and din and travail of the day , Strewer of Silence , Giver of the dew That doth our pastures and our souls renew , Still dwell remote , still on thy shoreless sea Float unattained in silent empery , Still light my thoughts , nor listen to a prayer Would make thee less imperishably fair ! II Can , then , my twofold nature find content In vain conceits of airy blandishment ? 40 Ask I no more ? Since yesterday I task My storm-strewn thoughts to tell me what I ask : Faint premenitions of mutation strange Steal o'er my perfect orb , and , with the change , Myself am changed ; the shadow of my earth Darkens the disk of that celestial worth Which only yesterday could still suffice Upwards to waft my thoughts in sacrifice ; My heightened fancy with its touches warm Moulds to a woman 's that ideal form ; 50 Nor yet a woman 's wholly , but divine With awe her purer essence bred in mine . Was it long brooding on their own surmise , Which , of the eyes engendered , fools the eyes , Or have I seen through that translucent air A Presence shaped in its seclusions bare , My Goddess looking on me from above As look our russet maidens when they love , But high-uplifted , o'er our human heat And passion-paths too rough for her pearl feet ? 60 Slowly the Shape took outline as I gazed At her full-orbed or crescent , till , bedazed With wonder-working light that subtly wrought My brain to its own substance , steeping thought In trances such as poppies give , I saw Things shut from vision by sight 's sober law , Amorphous , changeful , but defined at last Into the peerless Shape mine eyes hold fast . This , too , at first I worshipt : soon , like wine , Her eyes , in mine poured , frenzy-philtred mine ; 70 Passion put Worship 's priestly raiment on And to the woman knelt , the Goddess gone . Was I , then , more than mortal made ? or she Less than divine that she might mate with me ? If mortal merely , could my nature cope With such o'ermastery of maddening hope ? If Goddess , could she feel the blissful woe That women in their self-surrender know ? III Long she abode aloof there in her heaven , Far as the grape-bunch of the Pleiad seven 80 Beyond my madness ’ utmost leap ; but here Mine eyes have feigned of late her rapture near , Moulded of mind-mist that broad day dispels , Here in these shadowy woods and brook-lulled dells . Have no heaven-habitants e'er felt a void In hearts sublimed with ichor unalloyed ? E'er longed to mingle with a mortal fate Intense with pathos of its briefer date ? Could she partake , and live , our human stains ? Even with the thought there tingles through my veins 90 Sense of unwarned renewal ; I , the dead , Receive and house again the ardor fled , As once Alcestis ; to the ruddy brim Feel masculine virtue flooding every limb , And life , like Spring returning , brings the key That sets my senses from their winter free , Dancing like naked fauns too glad for shame . Her passion , purified to palest flame , Can it thus kindle ? Is her purpose this ? I will not argue , lest I lose a bliss 100 That makes me dream Tithonus ’ fortune mine , ( Or what of it was palpably divine Ere came the fruitlessly immortal gift ;) I cannot curb my hope 's imperious drift That wings with fire my dull mortality ; Though fancy-forged , ‘ tis all I feel or see . IV My Goddess sinks ; round Latmos ’ darkening brow Trembles the parting of her presence now , Faint as the perfume left upon the grass By her limbs ’ pressure or her feet that pass 110 By me conjectured , but conjectured so As things I touch far fainter substance show . Was it mine eyes ’ imposture I have seen Flit with the moonbeams on from shade to sheen Through the wood-openings ? Nay , I see her now Out of her heaven new-lighted , from her brow The hair breeze-scattered , like loose mists that blow Across her crescent , goldening as they go High-kirtled for the chase , and what was shown , Of maiden rondure , like the rose half-blown . 120 If dream , turn real ! If a vision , stay ! Take mortal shape , my philtre 's spell obey ! If hags compel thee from thy secret sky With gruesome incantations , why not I , Whose only magic is that I distil A potion , blent of passion , thought , and will , Deeper in reach , in force of fate more rich , Than e'er was juice wrung by Thessalian witch From moon-enchanted herbs ,— a potion brewed Of my best life in each diviner mood ? 130 Myself the elixir am , myself the bowl Seething and mantling with my soul of soul . Taste and be humanized : what though the cup , With thy lips frenzied , shatter ? Drink it up ! If but these arms may clasp , o'erquited so , My world , thy heaven , all life means I shall know . V Sure she hath heard my prayer and granted half , As Gods do who at mortal madness laugh . Yet if life 's solid things illusion seem , Why may not substance wear the mask of dream ? 140 In sleep she comes ; she visits me in dreams , And , as her image in a thousand streams , So in my veins , that her obey , she sees , Floating and flaming there , her images Bear to my little world 's remotest zone Glad messages of her , and her alone . With silence-sandalled Sleep she comes to me , ( But softer-footed , sweeter-browed , than she ,) In motion gracious as a seagull 's wing , And all her bright limbs , moving , seem to sing . 150 Let me believe so , then , if so I may With the night 's bounty feed my beggared day . In dreams I see her lay the goddess down With bow and quiver , and her crescent-crown Flicker and fade away to dull eclipse As down to mine she deigns her longed-for lips ; And as her neck my happy arms enfold , Flooded and lustred with her loosened gold , She whispers words each sweeter than a kiss : Then , wakened with the shock of sudden bliss , 160 My arms are empty , my awakener fled , And , silent in the silent sky o'erhead , But coldly as on ice-plated snow , she gleams , Herself the mother and the child of dreams . VI Gone is the time when phantasms could appease My quest phantasmal and bring cheated ease ; When , if she glorified my dreams , I felt Through all my limbs a change immortal melt At touch of hers illuminate with soul . Not long could I be stilled with Fancy 's dole ; 170 Too soon the mortal mixture in me caught Red fire from her celestial flame , and fought For tyrannous control in all my veins : My fool 's prayer was accepted ; what remains ? Or was it some eidolon merely , sent By her who rules the shades in banishment , To mock me with her semblance ? Were it thus , How ‘ scape I shame , whose will was traitorous ? What shall compensate an ideal dimmed ? How blanch again my statue virgin-limbed , 180 Soiled with the incense-smoke her chosen priest Poured more profusely as within decreased The fire unearthly , fed with coals from far Within the soul 's shrine ? Could my fallen star Be set in heaven again by prayers and tears And quenchless sacrifice of all my years , How would the victim to the flamen leap , And life for life 's redemption paid hold cheap ! But what resource when she herself descends From her blue throne , and o'er her vassal bends 190 That shape thrice-deified by love , those eyes Wherein the Lethe of all others lies ? When my white queen of heaven 's remoteness tires , Herself against her other self conspires , Takes woman 's nature , walks in mortal ways , And finds in my remorse her beauty 's praise ? Yet all would I renounce to dream again The dream in dreams fulfilled that made my pain , My noble pain that heightened all my years With crowns to win and prowess-breeding tears ; 200 Nay , would that dream renounce once more to see Her from her sky there looking down at me ! VII Goddess , reclimb thy heaven , and be once more An inaccessible splendor to adore , A faith , a hope of such transcendent worth As bred ennobling discontent with earth ; Give back the longing , back the elated mood That , fed with thee , spurned every meaner good ; Give even the spur of impotent despair That , without hope , still bade aspire and dare ; 210 Give back the need to worship , that still pours Down to the soul the virtue it adores ! Nay , brightest and most beautiful , deem naught These frantic words , the reckless wind of thought ; Still stoop , still grant ,— I live but in thy will ; Be what thou wilt , but be a woman still ! Vainly I cried , nor could myself believe That what I prayed for I would fain receive ; My moon is set ; my vision set with her ; No more can worship vain my pulses stir . 220 Goddess Triform , I own thy triple spell , My heaven 's queen ,— queen , too , of my earth and hell ! THE BLACK PREACHER A BRETON LEGEND At Carnac in Brittany , close on the bay , They show you a church , or rather the gray Ribs of a dead one , left there to bleach With the wreck lying near on the crest of the beach , Roofless and splintered with thunder-stone , ‘ Mid lichen-blurred gravestones all alone ; ‘ Tis the kind of ruin strange sights to see That may have their teaching for you and me . Something like this , then , my guide had to tell , Perched on a saint cracked across when he fell ; 10 But since I might chance give his meaning a wrench , He talking his patois and I English-French , I 'll put what he told me , preserving the tone , In a rhymed prose that makes it half his , half my own . An abbey-church stood here , once on a time , Built as a death-bed atonement for crime : ‘ Twas for somebody 's sins , I know not whose ; But sinners are plenty , and you can choose . Though a cloister now of the dusk-winged bat , ‘ Twas rich enough once , and the brothers grew fat , 20 Looser in girdle and purpler in jowl , Singing good rest to the founder 's lost soul . But one day came Northmen , and lithe tongues of fire Lapped up the chapter-house , licked off the spire , And left all a rubbish-heap , black and dreary , Where only the wind sings miserere . No priest has kneeled since at the altar 's foot , Whose crannies are searched by the nightshade 's root , Nor sound of service is ever heard , Except from throat of the unclean bird , 30 Hooting to unassoiled shapes as they pass In midnights unholy his witches ’ mass , Or shouting ‘ Ho ! ho ! ’ from the belfry high As the Devil 's sabbath-train whirls by . But once a year , on the eve of All-Souls , Through these arches dishallowed the organ rolls , Fingers long fleshless the bell-ropes work , The chimes peal muffled with sea-mists mirk , The skeleton windows are traced anew On the baleful nicker of corpse-lights blue , 40 And the ghosts must come , so the legend saith , To a preaching of Reverend Doctor Death . Abbots , monks , barons , and ladies fair Hear the dull summons and gather there : No rustle of silk now , no clink of mail , Nor ever a one greets his church-mate pale ; No knight whispers love in the châtelaine 's ear , His next-door neighbor this five-hundred year ; No monk has a sleek benedicite For the great lord shadowy now as he ; 50 Nor needeth any to hold his breath , Lest he lose the least word of Doctor Death . He chooses his text in the Book Divine , Tenth verse of the Preacher in chapter nine : ‘ " Whatsoever thy hand shall find thee to do , That do with thy whole might , or thou shalt rue ; For no man is wealthy , or wise , or brave , In that quencher of might-be 's and would-be 's , the grave . ” Bid by the Bridegroom , “ To-morrow , ” ye said , And To-morrow was digging a trench for your bed ; 60 Ye said , “ God can wait ; let us finish our wine ; ” Ye had wearied Him , fools , and that last knock was mine ! ’ But I can n't pretend to give you the sermon , Or say if the tongue were French , Latin , or German ; Whatever he preached in , I give you my word The meaning was easy to all that heard ; Famous preachers there have been and be , But never was one so convincing as he ; So blunt was never a begging friar , No Jesuit 's tongue so barbed with fire , 70 Cameronian never , nor Methodist , Wrung gall out of Scripture with such a twist . And would you know who his hearers must be ? I tell you just what my guide told me : Excellent teaching men have , day and night , From two earnest friars , a black and a white , The Dominican Death and the Carmelite Life ; And between these two there is never strife , For each has his separate office and station , And each his own work in the congregation ; 80 Whoso to the white brother deafens his ears , And cannot be wrought on by blessings or tears , Awake In his coffin must wait and wait , In that blackness of darkness that means too late , And come once a year , when the ghost-bell tolls , As till Doomsday it shall on the eve of All-Souls , To hear Doctor Death , whose words smart with the brine Of the Preacher , the tenth verse of chapter nine . ARCADIA REDIVIVA I , walking the familiar street , While a crammed horse-car jingled through it , Was lifted from my prosy feet And in Arcadia ere I knew it . Fresh sward for gravel soothed my tread , And shepherd 's pipes my ear delighted ; The riddle may be lightly read : I met two lovers newly plighted . They murmured by in happy care , New plans for paradise devising , 10 Just as the moon , with pensive stare , O'er Mistress Craigie 's pines was rising . Astarte , known nigh threescore years , Me to no speechless rapture urges ; Them in Elysium she enspheres , Queen , from of old , of thaumaturges . The railings put forth bud and bloom , The house-fronts all with myrtles twine them , And light-winged Loves in every room Make nests , and then with kisses line them . 20 O sweetness of untasted life ! O dream , its own supreme fulfillment ! O hours with all illusion rife , As ere the heart divined what ill meant ! ‘ Et ego ’ , sighed I to myself , And strove some vain regrets to bridle , ‘ Though now laid dusty on the shelf , Was hero once of such an idyl ! ‘ An idyl ever newly sweet , Although since Adam 's day recited , 30 Whose measures time them to Love 's feet , Whose sense is every ill requited . ’ Maiden , if I may counsel , drain Each drop of this enchanted season , For even our honeymoons must wane , Convicted of green cheese by Reason . And none will seem so safe from change , Nor in such skies benignant hover , As this , beneath whose witchery strange You tread on rose-leaves with your lover . 40 The glass unfilled all tastes can fit , As round its brim Conjecture dances ; For not Mephisto 's self hath wit To draw such vintages as Fancy 's . When our pulse beats its minor key , When play-time halves and school-time doubles , Age fills the cup with serious tea , Which once Dame Clicquot starred with bubbles . ‘ Fie , Mr. Graybeard ! Is this wise ? Is this the moral of a poet , 50 Who , when the plant of Eden dies , Is privileged once more to sow it ! ‘ That herb of clay-disdaining root , From stars secreting what it feeds on , Is burnt-out passion 's slag and soot Fit soil to strew its dainty seeds on ? ‘ Pray , why , if in Arcadia once , Need one so soon forget the way there ? Or why , once there , be such a dunce As not contentedly to stay there ? ’ 60 Dear child , ‘ twas but a sorry jest , And from my heart I hate the cynic Who makes the Book of Life a nest For comments staler than rabbinic . If Love his simple spell but keep , Life with ideal eyes to flatter , The Grail itself were crockery cheap To Every-day 's communion-platter . One Darby is to me well known , Who , as the hearth between them blazes , 70 Sees the old moonlight shine on Joan , And float her youthward in its hazes . He rubs his spectacles , he stares ,— ‘ Tis the same face that witched him early ! He gropes for his remaining hairs ,— Is this a fleece that feels so curly ? ‘ Good heavens ! but now ‘ twas winter gray , And I of years had more than plenty ; The almanac 's a fool ! ‘ Tis May ! Hang family Bibles ! I am twenty ! 80 ‘ Come , Joan , your arm ; we 'll walk the room — The lane , I mean — do you remember ? How confident the roses bloom , As if it ne'er could be December ! ‘ Nor more it shall , while in your eyes My heart its summer heat recovers , And you , howe'er your mirror lies , Find your old beauty in your lover 's . ’ THE NEST MAY When oaken woods with buds are pink , And new-come birds each morning sing , When fickle May on Summer 's brink Pauses , and knows not which to fling , Whether fresh bud and bloom again , Or hoar-frost silvering hill and plain , Then from the honeysuckle gray The oriole with experienced quest Twitches the fibrous bark away , The cordage of his hammock-nest . Cheering his labor with a note Rich as the orange of his throat . High o'er the loud and dusty road The soft gray cup in safety swings , To brim ere August with its load Of downy breasts and throbbing wings , O'er which the friendly elm-tree heaves An emerald roof with sculptured eaves . Below , the noisy World drags by In the old way , because it must , The bride with heartbreak in her eye , The mourner following hated dust : Thy duty , wingèd flame of Spring , Is but to love , and fly , and sing . Oh , happy life , to soar and sway Above the life by mortals led , Singing the merry months away , Master , not slave of daily bread , And , when the Autumn comes , to flee Wherever sunshine beckons thee ! PALINODE — DECEMBER Like some lorn abbey now , the wood Stands roofless in the bitter air ; In ruins on its floor is strewed The carven foliage quaint and rare , And homeless winds complain along The columned choir once thrilled with song . And thou , dear nest , whence joy and praise The thankful oriole used to pour , Swing'st empty while the north winds chase Their snowy swarms from Labrador : But , loyal to the happy past , I love thee still for what thou wast . Ah , when the Summer graces flee From other nests more dear than thou , And , where June crowded once , I see Only bare trunk and disleaved bough ; When springs of life that gleamed and gushed Run chilled , and slower , and are hushed ; When our own branches , naked long , The vacant nests of Spring betray , Nurseries of passion , love , and song That vanished as our year grew gray ; When Life drones o'er a tale twice told O'er embers pleading with the cold ,— I 'll trust , that , like the birds of Spring , Our good goes not without repair , But only flies to soar and sing Far off in some diviner air , Where we shall find it in the calms Of that fair garden ‘ neath the palms . A YOUTHFUL EXPERIMENT IN ENGLISH HEXAMETERS IMPRESSIONS OF HOMER Sometimes come pauses of calm , when the rapt bard , holding his heart back , Over his deep mind muses , as when o'er awehYpppHeNstricken ocean Poises a heapt cloud luridly , ripening the gale and the thunder ; Slow rolls onward the verse with a long swell heaving and swinging , Seeming to wait till , gradually wid'ning from far-off horizons , Piling the deeps up , heaping the glad-hearted surges before it , Gathers the thought as a strong wind darkening and cresting the tumult . Then every pause , every heave , each trough in the waves , has its meaning ; Full-sailed , forth like a tall ship steadies the theme , and around it , Leaping beside it in glad strength , running in wild glee beyond it , Harmonies billow exulting and floating the soul where it lists them , Swaying the listener 's fantasy hither and thither like drift-weed . BIRTHDAY VERSES WRITTEN IN A CHILD 'S ALBUM ‘ Twas sung of old in hut and hall How once a king in evil hour Hung musing o'er his castle wall , And , lost in idle dreams , let fall Into the sea his ring of power . Then , let him sorrow as he might , And pledge his daughter and his throne To who restored the jewel bright , The broken spell would ne'er unite ; The grim old ocean held its own . Those awful powers on man that wait , On man , the beggar or the king , To hovel bare or hall of state A magic ring that masters fate With each succeeding birthday bring . Therein are set four jewels rare : Pearl winter , summer 's ruby blaze , Spring 's emerald , and , than all more fair , Fall 's pensive opal , doomed to bear A heart of fire bedreamed with haze . To him the simple spell who knows The spirits of the ring to sway , Fresh power with every sunrise flows , And royal pursuivants are those That fly his mandates to obey . But he that with a slackened will Dreams of things past or things to be , From him the charm is slipping still , And drops , ere he suspect the ill , Into the inexorable sea . ESTRANGEMENT The path from me to you that led , Untrodden long , with grass is grown , Mute carpet that his lieges spread Before the Prince Oblivion When he goes visiting the dead . And who are they but who forget ? You , who my coming could surmise Ere any hint of me as yet Warned other ears and other eyes , See the path blurred without regret . But when I trace its windings sweet With saddened steps , at every spot That feels the memory in my feet , Each grass-blade turns forget-me-not , Where murmuring bees your name repeat . PHOEBE Ere pales in Heaven the morning star , A bird , the loneliest of its kind , Hears Dawn 's faint footfall from afar While all its mates are dumb and blind . It is a wee sad-colored thing , As shy and secret as a maid , That , ere in choir the robins sing , Pipes its own name like one afraid . It seems pain-prompted to repeat The story of some ancient ill , But Phoebe ! Phoebe ! sadly sweet Is all it says , and then is still . It calls and listens . Earth and sky , Hushed by the pathos of its fate , Listen : no whisper of reply Comes from its doom-dissevered mate . Phoebe ! it calls and calls again , And Ovid , could he but have heard , Had hung a legendary pain About the memory of the bird ; A pain articulate so long , In penance of some mouldered crime Whose ghost still flies the Furies ’ thong Down the waste solitudes of time . Waif of the young World 's wonder-hour , When gods found mortal maidens fair , And will malign was joined with power Love 's kindly laws to overbear , Like Progne , did it feel the stress And coil of the prevailing words Close round its being , and compress Man 's ampler nature to a bird 's ? One only memory left of all The motley crowd of vanished scenes , Hers , and vain impulse to recall By repetition what it means . Phoebe ! is all it has to say In plaintive cadence o'er and o'er , Like children that have lost their way , And know their names , but nothing more . Is it a type , since Nature 's Lyre Vibrates to every note in man , Of that insatiable desire , Meant to be so since life began ? I , in strange lands at gray of dawn , Wakeful , have heard that fruitless plaint Through Memory 's chambers deep withdrawn Renew its iterations faint . So nigh ! yet from remotest years It summons back its magic , rife With longings unappeased , and tears Drawn from the very source of life . DAS EWIG-WEIBLICHE How was I worthy so divine a loss , Deepening my midnights , kindling all my morns ? Why waste such precious wood to make my cross , Such far-sought roses for my crown of thorns ? And when she came , how earned I such a gift ? Why spend on me , a poor earth-delving mole , The fireside sweetnesses , the heavenward lift , The hourly mercy , of a woman 's soul ? Ah , did we know to give her all her right , What wonders even in our poor clay were done ! It is not Woman leaves us to our night , But our brute earth that grovels from her sun . Our nobler cultured fields and gracious domes We whirl too oft from her who still shines on To light in vain our caves and clefts , the homes Of night-bird instincts pained till she be gone . Still must this body starve our souls with shade ; But when Death makes us what we were before , Then shall her sunshine all our depths invade , And not a shadow stain heaven 's crystal floor . THE RECALL Come back before the birds are flown , Before the leaves desert the tree , And , through the lonely alleys blown , Whisper their vain regrets to me Who drive before a blast more rude , The plaything of my gusty mood , In vain pursuing and pursued ! Nay , come although the boughs be bare , Though snowflakes fledge the summer 's nest , And in some far Ausonian air The thrush , your minstrel , warm his breast . Come , sunshine 's treasurer , and bring To doubting flowers their faith in spring , To birds and me the need to sing ! ABSENCE Sleep is Death 's image ,— poets tell us so ; But Absence is the bitter self of Death , And , you away , Life 's lips their red forego , Parched in an air unfreshened by your breath . Light of those eyes that made the light of mine , Where shine you ? On what happier fields and flowers ? Heaven 's lamps renew their lustre less divine , But only serve to count my darkened hours . If with your presence went your image too , That brain-born ghost my path would never cross Which meets me now where'er I once met you , Then vanishes , to multiply my loss . MONNA LISA She gave me all that woman can , Nor her soul 's nunnery forego , A confidence that man to man Without remorse can never show . Rare art , that can the sense refine Till not a pulse rebellious stirs , And , since she never can be mine , Makes it seem sweeter to be hers ! THE OPTIMIST Turbid from London 's noise and smoke , Here I find air and quiet too ; Air filtered through the beech and oak , Quiet by nothing harsher broke Than wood-dove 's meditative coo . The Truce of God is here ; the breeze Sighs as men sigh relieved from care , Or tilts as lightly in the trees As might a robin : all is ease , With pledge of ampler ease to spare . Time , leaning on his scythe , forgets To turn the hour-glass in his hand , And all life 's petty cares and frets , Its teasing hopes and weak regrets , Are still as that oblivious sand . Repose fills all the generous space Of undulant plain ; the rook and crow Hush ; ‘ tis as if a silent grace , By Nature murmured , calmed the face Of Heaven above and Earth below . From past and future toils I rest , One Sabbath pacifies my year ; I am the halcyon , this my nest ; And all is safely for the best While the World 's there and I am here . So I turn tory for the nonce , And think the radical a bore , Who cannot see , thick-witted dunce , That what was good for people once Must be as good forevermore . Sun , sink no deeper down the sky ; Earth , never change this summer mood ; Breeze , loiter thus forever by , Stir the dead leaf or let it lie ; Since I am happy , all is good . ON BURNING SOME OLD LETTERS With what odorous woods and spices Spared for royal sacrifices , With what costly gums seld-seen , Hoarded to embalm a queen , With what frankincense and myrrh , Burn these precious parts of her , Full of life and light and sweetness As a summer day 's completeness , Joy of sun and song of bird Running wild in every word , Full of all the superhuman Grace and winsomeness of woman ? O'er these leaves her wrist has slid , Thrilled with veins where fire is hid ‘ Neath the skin 's pellucid veil , Like the opal 's passion pale ; This her breath has sweetened ; this Still seems trembling with the kiss She half-ventured on my name , Brow and cheek and throat aflame ; Over all caressing lies Sunshine left there by her eyes ; From them all an effluence rare With her nearness fills the air , Till the murmur I half-hear Of her light feet drawing near . Rarest woods were coarse and rough , Sweetest spice not sweet enough , Too impure all earthly fire For this sacred funeral-pyre ; These rich relics must suffice For their own dear sacrifice . Seek we first an altar fit For such victims laid on it : It shall be this slab brought home In old happy days from Rome ,— Lazuli , once blest to line Dian 's inmost cell and shrine . Gently now I lay them there . Pure as Dian 's forehead bare , Yet suffused with warmer hue , Such as only Latmos knew . Fire I gather from the sun In a virgin lens ; ‘ tis done ! Mount the flames , red , yellow , blue , As her moods were shining through , Of the moment 's impulse born ,— Moods of sweetness , playful scorn , Half defiance , half surrender , More than cruel , more than tender , Flouts , caresses , sunshine , shade , Gracious doublings of a maid Infinite in guileless art , Playing hide-seek with her heart . On the altar now , alas , There they lie a crinkling mass , Writhing still , as if with grief Went the life from every leaf ; Then ( heart-breaking palimpsest ! ) Vanishing ere wholly guessed , Suddenly some lines flash back , Traced in lightning on the black , And confess , till now denied , All the fire they strove to hide . What they told me , sacred trust , Stays to glorify my dust , There to burn through dust and damp Like a mage 's deathless lamp , While an atom of this frame Lasts to feed the dainty flame . All is ashes now , but they In my soul are laid away , And their radiance round me hovers Soft as moonlight over lovers , Shutting her and me alone In dream-Edens of our own ; First of lovers to invent Love , and teach men what it meant . THE PROTEST I could not bear to see those eyes On all with wasteful largess shine , And that delight of welcome rise Like sunshine strained through amber wine , But that a glow from deeper skies , From conscious fountains more divine , Is ( is it ? ) mine . Be beautiful to all mankind , As Nature fashioned thee to be ; ‘ Twould anger me did all not find The sweet perfection that 's in thee : Yet keep one charm of charms behind ,— Nay , thou'rt so rich , keep two or three For ( is it ? ) me ! THE PETITION Oh , tell me less or tell me more , Soft eyes with mystery at the core , That always seem to melt my own Frankly as pansies fully grown , Yet waver still ‘ tween no and yes ! So swift to cavil and deny , Then parley with concessions shy , Dear eyes , that make their youth be mine And through my inmost shadows shine , Oh , tell me more or tell me less ! FACT OR FANCY ? In town I hear , scarce wakened yet , My neighbor 's clock behind the wall Record the day 's increasing debt , And Cuckoo ! Cuckoo ! faintly call . Our senses run in deepening grooves , Thrown out of which they lose their tact , And consciousness with effort moves From habit past to present fact . So , in the country waked to-day , I hear , unwitting of the change , A cuckoo 's throb from far away Begin to strike , nor think it strange . The sound creates its wonted frame : My bed at home , the songster hid Behind the wainscoting ,— all came As long association bid . Then , half aroused , ere yet Sleep 's mist From the mind 's uplands furl away , To the familiar sound I list , Disputed for by Night and Day . I count to learn how late it is , Until , arrived at thirty-four , I question , ‘ What strange world is this Whose lavish hours would make me poor ? ’ Cuckoo ! Cuckoo ! Still on it went , With hints of mockery in its tone ; How could such hoards of time be spent By one poor mortal 's wit alone ? I have it ! Grant , ye kindly Powers , I from this spot may never stir , If only these uncounted hours May pass , and seem too short , with Her ! But who She is , her form and face , These to the world of dream belong ; She moves through fancy 's visioned space , Unbodied , like the cuckoo 's song . AGRO-DOLCE One kiss from all others prevents me , And sets all my pulses astir , And burns on my lips and torments me : ‘ Tis the kiss that I fain would give her . One kiss for all others requites me , Although it is never to be , And sweetens my dreams and invites me : ‘ Tis the kiss that she dare not give me . Ah , could it he mine , it were sweeter Than honey bees garner in dream , Though its bliss on my lips were fleeter Than a swallow 's dip to the stream . And yet , thus denied , it can never In the prose of life vanish away ; O'er my lips it must hover forever , The sunshine and shade of my day . THE BROKEN TRYST Walking alone where we walked together , When June was breezy and blue , I watch in the gray autumnal weather The leaves fall inconstant as you . If a dead leaf startle behind me , I think ‘ tis your garment 's hem , And , oh , where no memory could find me , Might I whirl away with them ! CASA SIN ALMA RECUERDO DE MADRID Silencioso por la puerta Voy de su casa desierta Do siempre feliz entré , Y la encuentro en vano abierta Cual la boca de una muerta Despues que el alma se fué . A CHRISTMAS CAROL FOR THE SUNDAY-SCHOOL CHILDREN OF THE CHURCH OF THE DISCIPLES ‘ What means this glory round our feet , ’ The Magi mused , ‘ more bright than morn ? ’ And voices chanted clear and sweet , ‘ To-day the Prince of Peace is born ! ’ ‘ What means that star , ’ the Shepherds said , ‘ That brightens through the rocky glen ? ’ And angels , answering overhead , Sang , ‘ Peace on earth , good-will to men ! ’ ‘ Tis eighteen hundred years and more Since those sweet oracles were dumb ; We wait for Him , like them of yore ; Alas , He seems so slow to come ! But it was said , in words of gold No time or sorrow e'er shall dim , That little children might be bold In perfect trust to come to Him . All round about our feet shall shine A light like that the wise men saw , If we our loving wills incline To that sweet Life which is the Law . So shall we learn to understand The simple faith of shepherds then , And , clasping kindly hand in hand , Sing , ‘ Peace on earth , good-will to men ! ’ And they who do their souls no wrong , But keep at eve the faith of morn , Shall daily hear the angel-song , ‘ To-day the Prince of Peace is born ! ’ MY PORTRAIT GALLERY Oft round my hall of portraiture I gaze , By Memory reared , the artist wise and holy , From stainless quarries of deep-buried days . There , as I muse in soothing melancholy , Your faces glow in more than mortal youth , Companions of my prime , now vanished wholly , The loud , impetuous boy , the low-voiced maiden , Now for the first time seen in flawless truth . Ah , never master that drew mortal breath Can match thy portraits , just and generous Death , Whose brush with sweet regretful tints is laden ! Thou paintest that which struggled here below Half understood , or understood for woe , And with a sweet forewarning Mak'st round the sacred front an aureole glow Woven of that light that rose on Easter morning . PAOLO TO FRANCESCA I was with thee in Heaven : I cannot tell If years or moments , so the sudden bliss , When first we found , then lost , us in a kiss . Abolished Time , abolished Earth and Hell , Left only Heaven . Then from our blue there fell The dagger 's flash , and did not fall amiss , For nothing now can rob my life of this ,— That once with thee in Heaven , all else is well . Us , undivided when man 's vengeance came , God 's half-forgives that doth not here divide ; And , were this bitter whirl-blast fanged with flame , To me ‘ twere summer , we being side by side : This granted , I God 's mercy will not blame , For , given thy nearness , nothing is denied . SONNET SCOTTISH BORDER As sinks the sun behind yon alien hills Whose heather-purple slopes , in glory rolled , Flush all my thought with momentary gold , What pang of vague regret my fancy thrills ? Here ‘ tis enchanted ground the peasant tills , Where the shy ballad dared its blooms unfold , And memory 's glamour makes new sights seem old , As when our life some vanished dream fulfils . Yet not to thee belong these painless tears , Land loved ere seen : before my darkened eyes , From far beyond the waters and the years , Horizons mute that wait their poet rise ; The stream before me fades and disappears , And in the Charles the western splendor dies . SONNET ON BEING ASKED FOR AN AUTOGRAPH IN VENICE Amid these fragments of heroic days When thought met deed with mutual passion 's leap , There sits a Fame whose silent trump makes cheap What short-lived rumor of ourselves we raise . They had far other estimate of praise Who stamped the signet of their souls so deep In art and action , and whose memories keep Their height like stars above our misty ways : In this grave presence to record my name Something within me hangs the head and shrinks . Dull were the soul without some joy in fame ; Yet here to claim remembrance were , methinks , Like him who , in the desert 's awful frame , Notches his cockney initials on the Sphinx . THE DANCING BEAR Far over Elf-land poets stretch their sway , And win their dearest crowns beyond the goal Of their own conscious purpose ; they control With gossamer threads wide-flown our fancy 's play , And so our action . On my walk to-day , A wallowing bear begged clumsily his toll , When straight a vision rose of Atta Troll , And scenes ideal witched mine eyes away . ‘ Merci , Mossieu ! ’ the astonished bear-ward cried , Grateful for thrice his hope to me , the slave Of partial memory , seeing at his side A bear immortal . The glad dole I gave Was none of mine ; poor Heine o'er the wide Atlantic welter stretched it from his grave . THE MAPLE The Maple puts her corals on in May , While loitering frosts about the lowlands cling , To be in tune with what the robins sing , Plastering new log-huts ‘ mid her branches gray ; But when the Autumn southward turns away , Then in her veins burns most the blood of Spring . And every leaf , intensely blossoming , Makes the year 's sunset pale the set of day . O Youth unprescient , were it only so With trees you plant , and in whose shade reclined , Thinking their drifting blooms Fate 's coldest snow , You carve dear names upon the faithful rind , Nor in that vernal stem the cross foreknow That Age shall bear , silent , yet unresigned ! NIGHTWATCHES While the slow clock , as they were miser 's gold , Counts and recounts the mornward steps of Time , The darkness thrills with conscience of each crime By Death committed , daily grown more bold . Once more the list of all my wrongs is told , And ghostly hands stretch to me from my prime Helpless farewells , as from an alien clime ; For each new loss redoubles all the old . This morn ‘ twas May ; the blossoms were astir With southern wind ; but now the boughs are bent With snow instead of birds , and all things freeze . How much of all my past is dumb with her , And of my future , too , for with her went Half of that world I ever cared to please ! DEATH OF QUEEN MERCEDES Hers all that Earth could promise or bestow ,— Youth , Beauty , Love , a crown , the beckoning years , Lids never wet , unless with joyous tears , A life remote from every sordid woe , And by a nation 's swelled to lordlier flow . What lurking-place , thought we , for doubts or fears , When , the day 's swan , she swam along the cheers Of the Alcalá , five happy months ago ? The guns were shouting Io Hymen then That , on her birthday , now denounce her doom ; The same white steeds that tossed their scorn of men To-day as proudly drag her to the tomb . Grim jest of fate ! Yet who dare call it blind , Knowing what life is , what our human-kind ? PRISON OF CERVANTES Seat of all woes ? Though Nature 's firm decree The narrowing soul with narrowing dungeon bind , Yet was his free of motion as the wind , And held both worlds , of spirit and sense , in fee . In charmed communion with his dual mind He wandered Spain , himself both knight and hind , Redressing wrongs he knew must ever be . His humor wise could see life 's long deceit , Man 's baffled aims , nor therefore both despise ; His knightly nature could ill fortune greet Like an old friend . Whose ever such kind eyes That pierced so deep , such scope , save his whose feet By Avon ceased ‘ neath the same April 's skies ?</note>

    <p>TO A LADY PLAYING ON THE CITHERN So dreamy-soft the notes , so far away They seem to fall , the horns of Oberon Blow their faint Hunt'shYpppHeNup from the good-time gone ; Or , on a morning of long-withered May , Larks tinkle unseen o'er Claudian arches gray , That Romeward crawl from Dreamland ; and anon My fancy flings her cloak of Darkness on , To vanish from the dungeon of To-day . In happier times and scenes I seem to be , And , as her fingers flutter o'er the strings , The days return when I was young as she , And my fledged thoughts began to feel their wings With all Heaven 's blue before them : Memory Or Music is it such enchantment sings ? THE EYE 'S TREASURY Gold of the reddening sunset , backward thrown In largess on my tall paternal trees , Thou with false hope or fear didst never tease His heart that hoards thee ; nor is childhood flown From him whose life no fairer boon hath known Than that what pleased him earliest still should please : And who hath incomes safe from chance as these , Gone in a moment , yet for life his own ? All other gold is slave of earthward laws ; This to the deeps of ether takes its flight , And on the topmost leaves makes glorious pause Of parting pathos ere it yield to night : So linger , as from me earth 's light withdraws , Dear touch of Nature , tremulously bright ! PESSIMOPTIMISM Ye little think what toil it was to build A world of men imperfect even as this , Where we conceive of Good by what we miss , Of ill by that wherewith best days are filled ; A world whose every atom is self-willed , Whose corner-stone is propt on artifice , Whose joy is shorter-lived than woman 's kiss , Whose wisdom hoarded is but to be spilled . Yet this is better than a life of caves , Whose highest art was scratching on a bone , Or chipping toilsome arrowheads of flint ; Better , though doomed to hear while Cleon raves , To see wit 's want eterned in paint or stone , And wade the drain-drenched shoals of daily print . THE BRAKES What countless years and wealth of brain were spent To bring us hither from our caves and huts , And trace through pathless wilds the deep-worn ruts Of faith and habit , by whose deep indent Prudence may guide if genius be not lent , Genius , not always happy when it shuts Its ears against the plodder 's ifs and buts , Hoping in one rash leap to snatch the event . The coursers of the sun , whose hoofs of flame Consume morn 's misty threshold , are exact As bankers ’ clerks , and all this star-poised frame , One swerve allowed , were with convulsion rackt ; This world were doomed , should Dulness fail , to tame Wit 's feathered heels in the stern stocks of fact . A FOREBODING What were the whole void world , if thou wert dead , Whose briefest absence can eclipse my day , And make the hours that danced with Time away Drag their funereal steps with muffled head ? Through thee , meseems , the very rose is red , From thee the violet steals its breath in May , From thee draw life all things that grow not gray , And by thy force the happy stars are sped . Thou near , the hope of thee to overflow Fills all my earth and heaven , as when in Spring , Ere April come , the birds and blossoms know , And grasses brighten round her feet to cling ; Nay , and this hope delights all nature so That the dumb turf I tread on seems to sing . III . FANCY UNDER THE OCTOBER MAPLES What mean these banners spread , These paths with royal red So gaily carpeted ? Comes there a prince to-day ? Such footing were too fine For feet less argentine Than Dian 's own or thine , Queen whom my tides obey . Surely for thee are meant These hues so orient That with a sultan 's tent Each tree invites the sun ; Our Earth such homage pays , So decks her dusty ways , And keeps such holidays , For one and only one . My brain shapes form and face , Throbs with the rhythmic grace And cadence of her pace To all fine instincts true ; Her footsteps , as they pass , Than moonbeams over grass Fall lighter ,— but , alas , More insubstantial too ! LOVE 'S CLOCK A PASTORAL DAPHNIS waiting ‘ O Dryad feet , Be doubly fleet , Timed to my heart 's expectant beat While I await her ! “ At four , ” vowed she ; ‘ Tis scarcely three , Yet by my time it seems to be A good hour later ! ’ CHLOE ‘ Bid me not stay ! Hear reason , pray ! ‘ Tis striking six ! Sure never day Was short as this is ! ’ DAPHNIS ‘ Reason nor rhyme Is in the chime ! It can n't be five ; I 've scarce had time To beg two kisses ! ’ BOTH ‘ Early or late , When lovers wait , And Love 's watch gains , if Time a gait So snail-like chooses , Why should his feet Become more fleet Than cowards ’ are , when lovers meet And Love 's watch loses ? ’ ELEANOR MAKES MACAROONS Light of triumph in her eyes , Eleanor her apron ties ; As she pushes back her sleeves , High resolve her bosom heaves . Hasten , cook ! impel the fire To the pace of her desire ; As you hope to save your soul , Bring a virgin casserole , Brightest bring of silver spoons ,— Eleanor makes macaroons ! Almond-blossoms , now adance In the smile of Southern France , Leave your sport with sun and breeze , Think of duty , not of ease ; Fashion , ‘ neath their jerkins brown , Kernels white as thistle-down , Tiny cheeses made with cream From the Galaxy 's mid-stream , Blanched in light of honeymoons ,— Eleanor makes macaroons ! Now for sugar ,— nay , our plan Tolerates no work of man . Hurry , then , ye golden bees ; Fetch your clearest honey , please , Garnered on a Yorkshire moor , While the last larks sing and soar , From the heather-blossoms sweet Where sea-breeze and sunshine meet , And the Augusts mask as Junes ,— Eleanor makes macaroons ! Next the pestle and mortar find . Pure rock-crystal ,— these to grind Into paste more smooth than silk , Whiter than the milkweed 's milk : Spread it on a rose-leaf , thus , Cate to please Theocritus ; Then the fire with spices swell , While , for her completer spell , Mystic canticles she croons ,— Eleanor makes macaroons ! Perfect ! and all this to waste On a graybeard 's palsied taste ! Poets so their verses write , Heap them full of life and light , And then fling them to the rude Mumbling of the multitude . Not so dire her fate as theirs , Since her friend this gift declares Choicest of his birthday boons ,— Eleanor 's dear macaroons ! February 22 , 1884 . TELEPATHY ‘ And how could you dream of meeting ? ’ Nay , how can you ask me , sweet ? All day my pulse had been beating The tune of your coming feet . And as nearer and ever nearer I felt the throb of your tread , To be in the world grew clearer , And my blood ran rosier red . Love called , and I could not linger , But sought the forbidden tryst , As music follows the finger Of the dreaming lutanist And though you had said it and said it , ‘ We must not be happy to-day , ’ Was I not wiser to credit The fire in my feet than your Nay ? SCHERZO When the down is on the chin And the gold-gleam in the hair , When the birds their sweethearts win And champagne is in the air , Love is here , and Love is there , Love is welcome everywhere . Summer 's cheek too soon turns thin , Days grow briefer , sunshine rare ; Autumn from his cannekin Blows the froth to chase Despair : Love is met with frosty stare , Cannot house ‘ neath branches bare . When new life is in the leaf And new red is in the rose , Though Love 's Maytlme be as brief As a dragon-fly 's repose , Never moments come like those , Be they Heaven or Hell : who knows ? All too soon comes Winter 's grief , Spendthrift Love 's false friends turn foes ; Softly comes Old Age , the thief , Steals the rapture , leaves the throes : Love his mantle round him throws ,— ‘ Time to say Good-by ; it snows . ’ ‘ FRANCISCUS DE VERULAMIO SIC COGITAVIT ’ That 's a rather bold speech , my Lord Bacon , For , indeed , is't so easy to know Just how much we from others have taken , And how much our own natural flow ? Since your mind bubbled up at its fountain , How many streams made it elate , While it calmed to the plain from the mountain , As every mind must that grows great ? While you thought ‘ twas You thinking as newly As Adam still wet with God 's dew , You forgot in your self-pride that truly The whole Past was thinking through you . Greece , Rome , nay , your namesake , old Roger , With Truth 's nameless delvers who wrought In the dark mines of Truth , helped to prod your Fine brain with the goad of their thought . As mummy was prized for a rich hue The painter no elsewhere could find , So ‘ twas buried men 's thinking with which you Gave the ripe mellow tone to your mind . I heard the proud strawberry saying , ‘ Only look what a ruby I 've made ! ’ It forgot how the bees in their maying Had brought it the stuff for its trade . And yet there 's the half of a truth in it , And my Lord might his copyright sue ; For a thought 's his who kindles new youth in it , Or so puts it as makes it more true . The birds but repeat without ending The same old traditional notes , Which some , by more happily blending , Seem to make over new in their throats ; And we men through our old bit of song run , Until one just improves on the rest , And we call a thing his , in the long run , Who utters it clearest and best . AUSPEX My heart , I cannot still it , Nest that had song-birds in it ; And when the last shall go , The dreary days , to fill it , Instead of lark or linnet , Shall whirl dead leaves and snow . Had they been swallows only , Without the passion stronger That skyward longs and sings ,— Woe 's me , I shall be lonely When I can feel no longer The impatience of their wings ! A moment , sweet delusion , Like birds the brown leaves hover ; But it will not be long Before their wild confusion Fall wavering down to cover The poet and his song . THE PREGNANT COMMENT Opening one day a book of mine , I absent , Hester found a line Praised with a pencil-mark , and this She left transfigured with a kiss . When next upon the page I chance , Like Poussin 's nymphs my pulses dance , And whirl my fancy where it sees Pan piping ‘ neath Arcadian trees , Whose leaves no winter-scenes rehearse , Still young and glad as Homer 's verse . ‘ What mean , ’ I ask , ‘ these sudden joys ? This feeling fresher than a boy 's ? What makes this line , familiar long , New as the first bird 's April song ? I could , with sense illumined thus , Clear doubtful texts in Æeschylus ! ’ Laughing , one day she gave the key , My riddle 's open-sesame ; Then added , with a smile demure , Whose downcast lids veiled triumph sure , ‘ If what I left there give you pain , You — you — can take it off again ; ‘ Twas for my poet , not for him , Your Doctor Donne there ! ’ Earth grew dim And wavered in a golden mist , As rose , not paper , leaves I kissed . Donne , you forgive ? I let you keep Her precious comment , poet deep . THE LESSON I sat and watched the walls of night With cracks of sudden lightning glow , And listened while with clumsy might The thunder wallowed to and fro . The rain fell softly now ; the squall , That to a torrent drove the trees , Had whirled beyond us to let fall Its tumult on the whitening seas . But still the lightning crinkled keen , Or fluttered fitful from behind The leaden drifts , then only seen , That rumbled eastward on the wind . Still as gloom followed after glare , While bated breath the pine-trees drew , Tiny Salmoneus of the air , His mimic bolts the firefly threw . He thought , no doubt , ‘ Those flashes grand , That light for leagues the shuddering sky , Are made , a fool could understand , By some superior kind of fly . ‘ He 's of our race 's elder branch , His family-arms the same as ours . Both born the twy-forked flame to launch , Of kindred , if unequal , powers . ’ And is man wiser ? Man who takes His consciousness the law to be Of all beyond his ken , and makes God but a bigger kind of Me ? SCIENCE AND POETRY He who first stretched his nerves of subtile wire Over the land and through the sea-depths still , Thought only of the flame-winged messenger As a dull drudge that should encircle earth With sordid messages of Trade , and tame Blithe Ariel to a bagman . But the Muse Not long will be defrauded . From her foe Her misused wand she snatches ; at a touch , The Age of Wonder is renewed again , And to our disenchanted day restores The Shoes of Swiftness that give odds to Thought , The Cloak that makes invisible ; and with these I glide , an airy fire , from shore to shore , Or from my Cambridge whisper to Cathay . A NEW YEAR 'S GREETING The century numbers fourscore years ; You , fortressed in your teens , To Time 's alarums close your ears , And , while he devastates your peers , Conceive not what he means . If e'er life 's winter fleck with snow Your hair 's deep shadowed bowers , That winsome head an art would know To make it charm , and wear it so As ‘ twere a wreath of flowers . If to such fairies years must come , May yours fall soft and slow As , shaken by a bee 's low hum , The rose-leaves waver , sweetly dumb , Down to their mates below ! THE DISCOVERY I watched a moorland torrent run Down through the rift itself had made , Golden as honey in the sun , Of darkest amber in the shade . In this wild glen at last , methought , The magic 's secret I surprise ; Here Celia 's guardian fairy caught The changeful splendors of her eyes . All else grows tame , the sky 's one blue , The one long languish of the rose , But these , beyond prevision new , Shall charm and startle to the close . WITH A SEASHELL Shell , whose lips , than mine more cold , Might with Dian 's ear make bold , Seek my Lady 's ; if thou win To that portal , shut from sin , Where commissioned angels ’ swords Startle back unholy words , Thou a miracle shalt see Wrought by it and wrought in thee ; Thou , the dumb one , shalt recover Speech of poet , speech of lover . If she deign to lift you there , Murmur what I may not dare ; In that archway , pearly-pink As the Dawn 's untrodden brink , Murmur , ‘ Excellent and good , Beauty 's best in every mood , Never common , never tame , Changeful fair as windwaved flame ’ — Nay , I maunder ; this she hears Every day with mocking ears , With a brow not sudden-stained With the flush of bliss restrained , With no tremor of the pulse More than feels the dreaming dulse In the midmost ocean 's caves , When a tempest heaps the waves . Thou must woo her in a phrase Mystic as the opal 's blaze , Which pure maids alone can see When their lovers constant be . I with thee a secret share , Half a hope , and half a prayer , Though no reach of mortal skill Ever told it all , or will ; Say , ‘ He bids me — nothing more — Tell you what you guessed before ! ’ THE SECRET I have a fancy : how shall I bring it Home to all mortals wherever they be ? Say it or sing it ? Shoe it or wing it , So it may outrun or outfly ME , Merest cocoon-web whence it broke free ? Only one secret can save from disaster , Only one magic is that of the Master : Set it to music ; give it a tune ,— Tune the brook sings you , tune the breeze brings you , Tune the wild columbines nod to in June ! This is the secret : so simple , you see ! Easy as loving , easy as kissing , Easy as — well , let me ponder — as missing , Known , since the world was , by scarce two or three . IV . HUMOR AND SATIRE FITZ ADAM 'S STORY The next whose fortune ‘ twas a tale to tell Was one whom men , before they thought , loved well , And after thinking wondered why they did , For half he seemed to let them , half forbid , And wrapped him so in humors , sheath on sheath , ‘ Twas hard to guess the mellow soul beneath : But , once divined , you took him to your heart , While he appeared to bear with you as part Of life 's impertinence , and once a year Betrayed his true self by a smile or tear , 10 Or rather something sweetly shy and loath , Withdrawn ere fully shown , and mixed of both . A cynic ? Not precisely : one who thrust Against a heart too prone to love and trust , Who so despised false sentiment he knew Scarce in himself to part the false and true , And strove to hide , by roughening-o'er the skin , Those cobweb nerves he could not dull within . Gentle by birth , but of a stem decayed , He shunned life 's rivalries and hated trade ; 20 On a small patrimony and larger pride , He lived uneaseful on the Other Side ( So he called Europe ) , only coming West To give his Old-World appetite new zest ; Yet still the New World spooked it in his veins , A ghost he could not lay with all his pains ; For never Pilgrims ’ offshoot scapes control Of those old instincts that have shaped his soul . A radical in thought , he puffed away With shrewd contempt the dust of usage gray , 30 Yet loathed democracy as one who saw , In what he longed to love , some vulgar flaw , And , shocked through all his delicate reserves , Remained a Tory by his taste and nerves , His fancy 's thrall , he drew all ergoes thence , And thought himself the type of common sense ; Misliking women , not from cross or whim , But that his mother shared too much in him , And he half felt that what in them was grace Made the unlucky weakness of his race . 40 What powers he had he hardly cared to know , But sauntered through the world as through a show ; A critic fine in his haphazard way , A sort of mild La Bruyère on half-pay . For comic weaknesses he had an eye Keen as an acid for an alkali , Yet you could feel , through his sardonic tone , He loved them all , unless they were his own . You might have called him , with his humorous twist , A kind of human entomologist ; 50 As these bring home , from every walk they take , Their hat-crowns stuck with bugs of curious make , So he filled all the lining of his head With characters impaled and ticketed , And had a cabinet behind his eyes For all they caught of mortal oddities . He might have been a poet — many worse — But that he had , or feigned , contempt of verse ; Called it tattooing language , and held rhymes The young world 's lullaby of ruder times . 60 Bitter in words , too indolent for gall , He satirized himself the first of all , In men and their affairs could find no law , And was the ill logic that he thought he saw . Scratching a match to light his pipe anew , With eyes half shut some musing whiffs he drew And thus began : ‘ I give you all my word , I think this mock-Decameron absurd ; Boccaccio 's garden ! how bring that to pass In our bleak clime save under double glass ? 70 The moral east-wind of New England life Would snip its gay luxuriance like a knife ; Mile-deep the glaciers brooded here , they say , Through æons numb ; we feel their chill to-day . These foreign plants are but half-hardy still , Die on a south , and on a north wall chill . Had we stayed Puritans ! They had some heat , ( Though whence derived I have my own conceit ,) But you have long ago raked up their fires ; Where they had faith , you 've ten sham-Gothic spires . 80 Why more exotics ? Try your native vines , And in some thousand years you may have wines ; Your present grapes are harsh , all pulps and skins , And want traditions of ancestral bins That saved for evenings round the polished board Old lava fires , the sun-steeped hillside 's hoard . Without a Past , you lack that southern wall O'er which the vines of Poesy should crawl ; Still they 're your only hope : no midnight oil Makes up for virtue wanting in the soil ; 90 Manure them well and prune them ; ‘ two n't be France , Nor Spain , nor Italy , but there 's your chance . You have one story-teller worth a score Of dead Boccaccios ,— nay , add twenty more ,— A hawthorn asking spring 's most dainty breath , And him you 're freezing pretty well to death . However , since you say so , I will tease My memory to a story by degrees , Though you will cry , “ Enough ! ” I 'm wellnigh sure , Ere I have dreamed through half my overture . 100 Stories were good for men who had no books , ( Fortunate race ! ) and built their nests like rooks In lonely towers , to which the Jongleur brought His pedler'shYpppHeNbox of cheap and tawdry thought , With here and there a fancy fit to see Wrought in quaint grace in golden filigree ,— Some ring that with the Muse 's finger yet Is warm , like Aucassin and Nicolete ; The morning newspaper has spoilt his trade , ( For better or for worse , I leave unsaid ,) 110 And stories now , to suit a public nice , Must be half epigram , half pleasant vice . ‘ All tourists know Shebagog County : there The summer idlers take their yearly stare , Dress to see Nature In a well-bred way , As ‘ twere Italian opera , or play , Encore the sunrise ( if they 're out of bed ) . And pat the Mighty Mother on the head : These have I seen ,— all things are good to see .— And wondered much at their complacency . 120 This world 's great show , that took in getting-up Millions of years , they finish ere they sup ; Sights that God gleams through with soul-tingling force They glance approvingly as things of course . Say , “ That 's a grand rock , ” “ This a pretty fall . ” Not thinking , “ Are we worthy ? ” What if all The scornful landscape should turn round and say , “ This is a fool , and that a popinjay ” ? I often wonder what the Mountain thinks Of French boots creaking o'er his breathless brinks , 130 Or how the Sun would scare the chattering crowd , If some fine day he chanced to think aloud . I , who love Nature much as sinners can , Love her where she most grandeur shows ,— in man : Here find I mountain , forest , cloud , and sun , River and sea , and glows when day is done ; Nay , where she makes grotesques , and moulds in jest The clown 's cheap clay , I find unfading zest . The natural instincts year by year retire , As deer shrink northward from the settler 's fire , 140 And he who loves the wild game-flavor more Than city-feasts , where every man 's a bore To every other man , must seek it where The steamer 's throb and railway 's iron blare Have not yet startled with their punctual stir The shy , wood-wandering brood of Character . ‘ There is a village , once the county town , Through which the weekly mail rolled dustily down , Where the courts sat , it may be , twice a year , And the one tavern reeked with rustic cheer ; 150 Cheeshogquesumscot erst , now Jethro hight , Red-man and pale-face bore it equal spite . The railway ruined it , the natives say , That passed unwisely fifteen miles away , And made a drain to which , with steady ooze , Filtered away law , stage-coach , trade , and news . The railway saved it : so at least think those Who love old ways , old houses , old repose . Of course the Tavern stayed : its genial host Thought not of flitting more than did the post 160 On which high-hung the fading signboard creaks , Inscribed , “ The Eagle Inn , by Ezra Weeks . ” ‘ If in life 's journey you should ever find An inn medicinal for body and mind , ‘ Tis sure to be some drowsy-looking house Whose easy landlord has a bustling spouse : He , if he like you , will not long forego Some bottle deep in cobwebbed dust laid low , That , since the War we used to call the “ Last , ” Has dozed and held its lang-syne memories fast : 170 From him exhales that Indian-summer air Of hazy , lazy welcome everywhere , While with her toil the napery is white , The china dustless , the keen knife-blades bright , Salt dry as sand , and bread that seems as though ‘ Twere rather sea-foam baked than vulgar dough . ‘ In our swift country , houses trim and white Are pitched like tents , the lodging of a night ; Each on its bank of baked turf mounted high Perches impatient o'er the roadside dry , 180 While the wronged landscape coldly stands aloof , Refusing friendship with the upstart roof . Not so the Eagle ; on a grass-green swell That toward the south with sweet concessions fell It dwelt retired , and half had grown to be As aboriginal as rock or tree . It nestled close to earth , and seemed to brood O'er homely thoughts in a half-conscious mood , As by the peat that rather fades than burns The smouldering grandam nods and knits by turns , 190 Happy , although her newest news were old Ere the first hostile drum at Concord rolled . If paint it e'er had known , it knew no more Than yellow lichens spattered thickly o'er That soft lead-gray , less dark beneath the eaves Which the slow brush of wind and weather leaves . The ample roof sloped backward to the ground , And vassal lean-tos gathered thickly round , Patched on , as sire or son had felt the need , Like chance growths sprouting from the old roofs seed , 200 Just as about a yellow-pine-tree spring Its rough-barked darlings in a filial ring . But the great chimney was the central thought Whose gravitation through the cluster wrought ; For ‘ tis not styles far-fetched from Greece or Rome , But just the Fireside , that can make a home ; None of your spindling things of modern style , Like pins stuck through to stay the card-built pile , It rose broad-shouldered , kindly , debonair , Its warm breath whitening in the October air , 210 While on its front a heart in outline showed The place it filled in that serene abode . ‘ When first I chanced the Eagle to explore . Ezra sat listless by the open door ; One chair careened him at an angle meet , Another nursed his hugely slippered feet ; Upon a third reposed a shirt-sleeved arm , And the whole man diffused tobacco 's charm . “ Are you the landlord ? ” “ Wahl , I guess I be , ” Watching the smoke he answered leisurely . 220 He was a stoutish man , and through the breast Of his loose shirt there showed a brambly chest ; Streaked redly as a wind-foreboding morn , His tanned cheeks curved to temples closely shorn ; Clean-shaved he was , save where a hedge of gray Upon his brawny throat leaned every way About an Adam'shYpppHeNapple , that beneath Bulged like a boulder from a brambly heath . The Western World 's true child and nursling he , Equipt with aptitudes enough for three : 230 No eye like his to value horse or cow , Or gauge the contents of a stack or mow ; He could foretell the weather at a word , He knew the haunt of every beast and bird , Or where a two-pound trout was sure to lie , Waiting the flutter of his homemade fly ; Nay , once in autumns five , he had the luck To drop at fair-play range a ten-tined buck ; Of sportsmen true he favored every whim , But never cockney found a guide in him ; 240 A natural man , with all his instincts fresh , Not buzzing helpless in Reflection 's mesh , Firm on its feet stood his broad-shouldered mind , As bluffly honest as a northwest wind ; Hard-headed and soft-hearted , you 'd scarce meet A kindlier mixture of the shrewd and sweet ; Generous by birth , and ill at saying “ No , ” Yet in a bargain he was all men 's foe , Would yield no inch of vantage in a trade , And give away ere nightfall all he made . 250 “ Can I have lodging here ? ” once more I said . He blew a whiff , and , leaning back his head , “ You come a piece through Bailey 's woods , I s'pose , Acrost a bridge where a big swamp-oak grows ? It do n't grow , neither ; it 's ben dead ten year , Nor th ’ ai n't a livin ’ creetur , fur nor near , Can tell wut killed it ; but I some misdoubt ‘ Twas borers , there 's sech heaps on ‘ em about . You didn ’ chance to run ag'inst my son , A long , slab-sided youngster with a gun ? 260 He 'd oughto ben back more ‘ n an hour ago , An ’ brought some birds to dress for supper — sho ! There he comes now . ‘ Say , Obed , wut ye got ? ( He 'll hev some upland plover like as not . ) Wal , them 's real nice uns , an 'll eat A 1 , Ef I can stop their bein ’ overdone ; Nothin ’ riles me ( I pledge my fastin ’ word ) Like cookin ’ out the natur ’ of a bird ; ( Obed , you pick ‘ em out o ’ sight an ’ sound , Your ma'am do n't love no feathers cluttrin ’ round ;) 270 Jes ’ scare ‘ em with the coals ,— thet 's my idee . ” Then , turning suddenly about on me , “ Wal , Square , I guess so . Callilate to stay ? I 'll ask Mis ’ Weeks ; ‘ bout thet it 's hern to say . ” ‘ Well , there I lingered all October through , In that sweet atmosphere of hazy blue , So leisurely , so soothing , so forgiving , That sometimes makes New England fit for living . I watched the landscape , erst so granite glum , Bloom like the south side of a ripening plum , 280 And each rock-maple on the hillside make His ten days ’ sunset doubled in the lake ; The very stone walls draggling up the hills Seemed touched , and wavered in their roundhead wills . Ah ! there 's a deal of sugar in the sun ! Tap me in Indian summer , I should run A juice to make rock-candy of ,— but then We get such weather scarce one year in ten . ‘ There was a parlor in the house , a room To make you shudder with its prudish gloom . 290 The furniture stood round with such an air , There seemed an old maid 's ghost in every chair , Which looked as it had scuttled to its place And pulled extempore a Sunday face , Too smugly proper for a world of sin , Like boys on whom the minister comes in . The table , fronting you with icy stare , Strove to look witless that its legs were bare , While the black sofa with its horse-hair pall Gloomed like a bier for Comfort 's funeral . 300 Each piece appeared to do its chilly best To seem an utter stranger to the rest , As if acquaintanceship were deadly sin , Like Britons meeting in a foreign inn . Two portraits graced the wall in grimmest truth , Mister and Mistress W. in their youth ,— New England youth , that seems a sort of pill , Half wish-I-dared , half Edwards on the Will , Bitter to swallow , and which leaves a trace Of Calvinistic colic on the face . 310 Between them , o'er the mantel , hung in state Solomon 's temple , done in copperplate ; Invention pure , but meant , we may presume , To give some Scripture sanction to the room . Facing this last , two samplers you might see , Each , with its urn and stiffly weeping tree , Devoted to some memory long ago More faded than their lines of worsted woe ; Cut paper decked their frames against the flies , Though none e'er dared an entrance who were wise , 320 And bushed asparagus in fading green Added its shiver to the franklin clean . ‘ When first arrived , I chilled a half-hour there , Nor dared deflower with use a single chair ; I caught no cold , yet flying pains could find For weeks in me ,— a rheumatism of mind . One thing alone imprisoned there had power To hold me in the place that long half-hour : A scutcheon this , a helm-surmounted shield , Three griffins argent on a sable field ; 330 A relic of the shipwrecked past was here , And Ezra held some Old-World lumber dear . Nay , do not smile ; I love this kind of thing , These cooped traditions with a broken wing , This freehold nook in Fancy 's pipe-blown ball , This less than nothing that is more than all ! Have I not seen sweet natures kept alive Amid the humdrum of your business hive , Undowered spinsters shielded from all harms , By airy incomes from a coat of arms ? ’ 340 He paused a moment , and his features took The flitting sweetness of that inward look I hinted at before ; but , scarcely seen , It shrank for shelter ‘ neath his harder mien , And , rapping his black pipe of ashes clear , He went on with a self-derisive sneer : ‘ No doubt we make a part of God 's design , And break the forest-path for feet divine ; To furnish foothold for this grand prevision Is good , and yet — to be the mere transition , 350 That , you will say , is also good , though I Scarce like to feed the ogre By-and-By . Raw edges rasp my nerves ; my taste is wooed By things that are , not going to be , good , Though were I what I dreamed two lustres gone , I 'd stay to help the Consummation on , Whether a new Rome than the old more fair , Or a deadflat of rascal-ruled despair ; But my skull somehow never closed the suture That seems to knit yours firmly with the future , 360 So you 'll excuse me if I 'm sometimes fain To tie the Past 's warm nightcap o'er my brain ; I 'm quite aware ‘ tis not in fashion here , But then your northeast winds are so severe ! ‘ But to my story : though ‘ tis truly naught But a few hints in Memory 's sketchbook caught , And which may claim a value on the score Of calling back some scenery now no more . Shall I confess ? The tavern 's only Lar Seemed ( be not shocked ! ) its homely-featured bar . 370 Here dozed a fire of beechen logs , that bred Strange fancies in its embers golden-red , And nursed the loggerhead whose hissing dip , Timed by nice instinct , creamed the mug of flip That made from mouth to mouth its genial round , Nor left one nature wholly winter-bound ; Hence dropt the tinkling coal all mellow-ripe For Uncle Reuben 's talk-extinguished pipe ; Hence rayed the heat , as from an indoor sun , That wooed forth many a shoot of rustic fun . 380 Here Ezra ruled as king by right divine ; No other face had such a wholesome shine , No laugh like his so full of honest cheer ; Above the rest it crowed like Chanticleer . ‘ In this one room his dame you never saw , Where reigned by custom old a Salic law ; Here coatless lolled he on his throne of oak , And every tongue paused midway if he spoke . Due mirth he loved , yet was his sway severe ; No blear-eyed driveller got his stagger here ; 390 “ Measure was happiness ; who wanted more , Must buy his ruin at the Deacon 's store ; ” None but his lodgers after ten could stay , Nor after nine on eves of Sabbath-day . He had his favorites and his pensioners , The same that gypsy Nature owns for hers : Loose-ended souls , whose skills bring scanty gold , And whom the poor-house catches when they 're old ; Rude country-minstrels , men who doctor kine , Or graft , and , out of scions ten , save nine ; 400 Creatures of genius they , but never meant To keep step with the civic regiment , These Ezra welcomed , feeling in his mind Perhaps some motions of the vagrant kind ; These paid no money , yet for them he drew Special Jamaica from a tap they knew , And , for their feelings , chalked behind the door With solemn face a visionary score . This thawed to life in Uncle Reuben 's throat A torpid shoal of jest and anecdote , 410 Like those queer fish that doze the droughts away , And wait for moisture , wrapped in sun-baked clay ; This warmed the one-eyed fiddler to his task , Perched in the corner on an empty cask , By whose shrill art rapt suddenly , some boor Rattled a double-shuffle on the floor ; “ Hull 's Victory ” was , indeed , the favorite air , Though “ Yankee Doodle ” claimed its proper share . ‘'Twas there I caught from Uncle Reuben 's lips , In dribbling monologue ‘ twixt whiffs and sips , 420 The story I so long have tried to tell ; The humor coarse , the persons common ,— well , From Nature only do I love to paint , Whether she send a satyr or a saint ; To me Sincerity 's the one thing good , Soiled though she be and lost to maidenhood . Quompegan is a town some ten miles south From Jethro , at Nagumscot river-mouth , A seaport town , and makes its title good With lumber and dried fish and eastern wood . 430 Here Deacon Bitters dwelt and kept the Store , The richest man for many a mile of shore ; In little less than everything dealt he , From meeting-houses to a chest of tea ; So dextrous therewithal a flint to skin , He could make profit on a single pin ; In business strict , to bring the balance true He had been known to bite a fig in two , And change a board-nail for a shingle-nail . All that he had he ready held for sale , 440 His house , his tomb , whate'er the law allows , And he had gladly parted with his spouse . His one ambition still to get and get , He would arrest your very ghost for debt . His store looked righteous , should the Parson come , But in a dark back-room he peddled rum , And eased Ma'am Conscience , if she e'er would scold , By christening it with water ere he sold . A small , dry man he was , who wore a queue , And one white neckcloth all the week-days through ,— 450 On Monday white , by Saturday as dun As that worn homeward by the prodigal son . His frosted earlocks , striped with foxy brown , Were braided up to hide a desert crown ; His coat was brownish , black perhaps of yore ; In summer-time a banyan loose he wore ; His trousers short , through many a season true , Made no pretence to hide his stockings blue ; A waistcoat buff his chief adornment was , Its porcelain buttons rimmed with dusky brass . 460 A deacon he , you saw it in each limb , And well he knew to deacon-off a hymn , Or lead the choir through all its wandering woes With voice that gathered unction in his nose , Wherein a constant snuffle you might hear , As if with him ‘ twere winter all the year . At pew-head sat he with decorous pains , In sermon-time could foot his weekly gains , Or , with closed eyes and heaven-abstracted air , Could plan a new investment in long-prayer . 470 A pious man , and thrifty too , he made The psalms and prophets partners in his trade , And in his orthodoxy straitened more As it enlarged the business at his store ; He honored Moses , but , when gain he planned , Had his own notion of the Promised Land . ‘ Soon as the winter made the sledding good , From far around the farmers hauled him wood , For all the trade had gathered ‘ neath his thumb . He paid in groceries and New England rum , 480 Making two profits with a conscience clear ,— Cheap all he bought , and all he paid with dear . With his own mete-wand measuring every load , Each somehow had diminished on the road ; An honest cord in Jethro still would fail By a good foot upon the Deacon 's scale , And , more to abate the price , his gimlet eye Would pierce to cat-sticks that none else could spy ; Yet none dared grumble , for no farmer yet But New Year found him in the Deacon 's debt . 490 ‘ While the first snow was mealy under feet , A team drawled creaking down Quompegan street . Two cords of oak weighed down the grinding sled , And cornstalk fodder rustled overhead ; The oxen 's muzzles , as they shouldered through , Were silver-fringed ; the driver 's own was blue As the coarse frock that swung below his knee . Behind his load for shelter waded he ; His mittened hands now on his chest he beat , Now stamped the stiffened cowhides of his feet , 500 Hushed as a ghost 's ; his armpit scarce could hold The walnut whipstock slippery-bright with cold . What wonder if , the tavern as he past , He looked and longed , and stayed his beasts at last , Who patient stood and veiled themselves in steam While he explored the bar-room 's ruddy gleam ? ‘ Before the fire , in want of thought profound , There sat a brother-townsman weather-bound : A sturdy churl , crisp-headed , bristly-eared , Red as a pepper ; ‘ twixt coarse brows and beard 510 His eyes lay ambushed , on the watch for fools , Clear , gray , and glittering like two bay-edged pools ; A shifty creature , with a turn for fun , Could swap a poor horse for a better one ,— He 'd a high-stepper always in his stall ; Liked far and near , and dreaded therewithal . To him the in-comer , “ Perez , how d ’ ye do ? ” “ Jest as I 'm mind to , Obed ; how do you ? ” Then , his eyes twinkling such swift gleams as run Along the levelled barrel of a gun 520 Brought to his shoulder by a man you know Will bring his game down , he continued , “ So , I s'pose you 're haulin ’ wood ? But you 're too late ; The Deacon 's off ; Old Splitfoot could n't wait ; He made a bee-line las ’ night in the storm To where he wo n't need wood to keep him warm . ‘ Fore this he 's treasurer of a fund to train Young imps as missionaries ; hopes to gain That way a contract that he has in view For fireproof pitchforks of a pattern new , 530 It must have tickled him , all drawbacks weighed , To think he stuck the Old One in a trade ; His soul , to start with , was n't worth a carrot . And all he 'd left ‘ ould hardly serve to swear at . ” ‘ By this time Obed had his wits thawed out , And , looking at the other half in doubt , Took off his fox-skin cap to scratch his head , Donned it again , and drawled forth , “ Mean he 's dead ? ” “ Jesso ; he 's dead and t'other d that follers With folks that never love a thing but dollars . 540 He pulled up stakes last evening , fair and square , And ever since there 's been a row Down There . The minute the old chap arrived , you see , Comes the Boss-devil to him , and says he , ‘ What are you good at ? Little enough , I fear ; We callilate to make folks useful here . ’ ‘ Well , ’ says old Bitters , ‘ I expect I can Scale a fair load of wood with e'er a man . ’ ‘ Wood we do n't deal in ; but perhaps you 'll suit , Because we buy our brimstone by the foot : 550 Here , take this measurin ’ - rod , as smooth as sin , And keep a reckonin ’ of what loads comes in . You 'll not want business , for we need a lot To keep the Yankees that you send us hot ; At firin ’ up they 're barely half as spry As Spaniards or Italians , though they 're dry ; At first we have to let the draught on stronger , But , heat ‘ em through , they seem to hold it longer . ’ ‘ " Bitters he took the rod , and pretty soon A teamster comes , whistling an ex-psalm tune . 560 A likelier chap you would n't ask to see , No different , but his limp , from you or me ” — “ No different , Perez ! Do n't your memory fail ? Why , where in thunder was his horns and tail ? ” “ They 're only worn by some old-fashioned pokes ; They mostly aim at looking just like folks . Sech things are scarce as queues and top-boots here ; ‘ Twould spoil their usefulness to look too queer . Ef you could always know ‘ em when they come , They 'd get no purchase on you : now be mum . 570 On come the teamster , smart as Davy Crockett , Jinglin ’ the red-hot coppers in his pocket , And clost behind , ( ‘ twas gold-dust , you 'd ha ’ sworn ,) A load of sulphur yallower ‘ n seed-corn ; To see it wasted as it is Down There Would make a Friction-Match Co. tear its hair ! ‘ Hold on ! ’ says Bitters , ‘ stop right where you be ; You can n't go in athout a pass from me . ’ ‘ All right , ’ says t'other , ‘ only step round smart ; I must be home by noon-time with the cart . ’ 580 Bitters goes round it sharp-eyed as a rat , Then with a scrap of paper on his hat Pretends to cipher . ‘ By the public staff , That load scarce rises twelve foot and a half . ’ ‘ There 's fourteen foot and over , ’ says the driver , ‘ Worth twenty dollars , ef it 's worth a stiver ; Good fourth-proof brimstone , that 'll make ‘ em squirm ,— I leave it to the Headman of the Firm ; After we masure it , we always lay Some on to allow for settlin ’ by the way . 590 Imp and full-grown , I 've carted sulphur here , And gi'n fair satisfaction , thirty year . ’ With that they fell to quarrellin ’ so loud That in five minutes they had drawed a crowd , And afore long the Boss , who heard the row , Comes elbowin ’ in with ‘ What 's to pay here now ? ’ Both parties heard , the measurin ’ - rod he takes , And of the load a careful survey makes . ‘ Sence I have bossed the business here , ’ says he , ‘ No fairer load was ever seen by me . ’ 600 Then , turnin ’ to the Deacon , ‘ You mean cus . None of your old Quompegan tricks with us ! They wo n't do here : we 're plain old-fashioned folks , And do n't quite understand that kind o ’ jokes . I know this teamster , and his pa afore him , And the hard-working Mrs. D. that bore him ; He would n't soil his conscience with a lie , Though he might get the custom-house thereby . Here , constable , take Bitters by the queue . And clap him into furnace ninety-two , 610 And try this brimstone on him ; if he 's bright , He 'll find the masure honest afore night . He is n't worth his fuel , and I 'll bet The parish oven has to take him yet ! ’ ” ‘ This is my tale , heard twenty years ago From Uncle Reuben , as the logs burned low , Touching the walls and ceiling with that bloom That makes a rose 's calyx of a room . I could not give his language , wherethrough ran The gamy flavor of the bookless man 620 Who shapes a word before the fancy cools , As lonely Crusoe improvised his tools . I liked the tale ,— ‘ twas like so many told By Rutebeuf and his Brother Trouvères bold ; Nor were the hearers much unlike to theirs , Men unsophisticate , rude-nerved as bears . Ezra is gone and his large-hearted kind , The landlords of the hospitable mind ; Good Warriner of Springfield was the last ; An inn is now a vision of the past ; 630 One yet-surviving host my mind recalls ,— You 'll find him if you go to Trenton Falls . ’ THE ORIGIN OF DIDACTIC POETRY When wise Minerva still was young And just the least romantic , Soon after from Jove 's head she flung That preternatural antic , ‘ Tis said , to keep from idleness Or flirting , those twin curses , She spent her leisure , more or less , In writing po ——, no , verses . How nice they were ! to rhyme with far A kind star did not tarry ; The metre , too , was regular As schoolboy 's dot and carry ; And full they were of pious plums , So extra-super-moral ,— For sucking Virtue 's tender gums Most tooth-enticing coral . A clean , fair copy she prepares , Makes sure of moods and tenses , With her own hand ,— for prudence spares A man - ( or woman - ) - uensis ; Complete , and tied with ribbons proud , She hinted soon how cosy a Treat it would be to read them loud After next day 's Ambrosia . The Gods thought not it would amuse So much as Homer 's Odyssees , But could not very well refuse The properest of Goddesses ; So all sat round in attitudes Of various dejection , As with a hem ! the queen of prudes Began her grave prelection . At the first pause Zeus said , ‘ Well sung !— I mean — ask Phoebus ,— he knows . ’ Says Phoebus , ‘ Zounds ! a wolf 's among Admetus 's merinos ! Fine ! very fine ! but I must go ; They stand in need of me there ; Excuse me ! ’ snatched his stick , and so Plunged down the gladdened ether . With the next gap , Mars said , ‘ For me Do n't wait ,— naught could be finer , But I 'm engaged at half past three ,— A fight in Asia Minor ! ’ Then Venus lisped , ‘ I 'm sorely tried , These duty-calls are vip'rous ; But I must go ; I have a bride To see about in Cyprus . ’ Then Bacchus ,— ‘ I must say good-by , Although my peace it jeopards ; I meet a man at four , to try A well-broke pair of leopards . ’ His words woke Hermes . ‘ Ah ! ’ he said , ‘ I so love moral theses ! ’ Then winked at Hebe , who turned red , And smoothed her apron 's creases . Just then Zeus snored ,— the Eagle drew His head the wing from under ; Zeus snored ,— o'er startled Greece there flew The many-volumed thunder . Some augurs counted nine , some , ten ; Some said ‘ twas war , some , famine ; And all , that other-minded men Would get a precious ——. Proud Pallas sighed , ‘ It will not do ; Against the Muse I 've sinned , oh ! ’ And her torn rhymes sent flying through Olympus 's back window . Then , packing up a peplus clean , She took the shortest path thence , And opened , with a mind serene , A Sunday-school in Athens . The verses ? Some in ocean swilled , Killed every fish that bit to ‘ em ; Some Galen caught , and , when distilled , Found morphine the residuum ; But some that rotted on the earth Sprang up again in copies , And gave two strong narcotics birth , Didactic verse and poppies . Years after , when a poet asked The Goddess 's opinion , As one whose soul its wings had tasked In Art 's clear-aired dominion , ‘ Discriminate , ’ she said , ‘ betimes ; The Muse is unforgiving ; Put all your beauty in your rhymes , Your morals in your living . ’ THE FLYING DUTCHMAN Do n't believe in the Flying Dutchman ? I 've known the fellow for years ; My button I 've wrenched from his clutch , man : I shudder whenever he nears ! He 's a Rip van Winkle skipper , A Wandering Jew of the sea , Who sails his bedevilled old clipper In the wind 's eye , straight as a bee . Back topsails ! you can n't escape him ; The man-ropes stretch with his weight , And the queerest old toggeries drape him , The Lord knows how long out of date ! Like a long-disembodied idea , ( A kind of ghost plentiful now ,) He stands there ; you fancy you see a Coeval of Teniers or Douw . He greets you ; would have you take letters : You scan the addresses with dread , While he mutters his donners and wetters ,— They 're all from the dead to the dead ! You seem taking time for reflection , But the heart fills your throat with a jam , As you spell in each faded direction An ominous ending in dam . Am I tagging my rhymes to a legend ? That were changing green turtle to mock : No , thank you ! I 've found out which wedge-end Is meant for the head of a block . The fellow I have in my mind 's eye Plays the old Skipper 's part here on shore , And sticks like a burr , till he finds I Have got just the gauge of his bore . This postman ‘ twist one ghost and t'other , With last dates that smell of the mould , I have met him ( O man and brother , Forgive me ! ) in azure and gold . In the pulpit I 've known of his preaching , Out of hearing behind the time , Some statement of Balaam 's impeaching , Giving Eve a due sense of her crime . I have seen him some poor ancient thrashing Into something ( God save us ! ) more dry , With the Water of Life itself washing The life out of earth , sea , and sky . O dread fellow-mortal , get newer Despatches to carry , or none ! We 're as quick as the Greek and the Jew were At knowing a loaf from a stone . Till the couriers of God fail in duty , We sha'n ' t ask a mummy for news , Nor sate the soul 's hunger for beauty With your drawings from casts of a Muse . CREDIDIMUS JOVEM REGNARE O days endeared to every Muse , When nobody had any Views , Nor , while the cloudscape of his mind By every breeze was new designed , Insisted all the world should see Camels or whales where none there be ! O happy days , when men received From sire to son what all believed , And left the other world in bliss , Too busy with bedevilling this ! 10 Beset by doubts of every breed In the last bastion of my creed , With shot and shell for Sabbath-chime , I watch the storming-party climb , Panting ( their prey in easy reach ) , To pour triumphant through the breach In walls that shed like snowflakes tons Of missiles from old-fashioned guns , But crumble ‘ neath the storm that pours All day and night from bigger bores . 20 There , as I hopeless watch and wait The last life-crushing coil of Fate , Despair finds solace in the praise Of those serene dawn-rosy days Ere microscopes had made us heirs To large estates of doubts and snares , By proving that the title-deeds , Once all-sufficient for men 's needs , Are palimpsests that scarce disguise The tracings of still earlier lies , 30 Themselves as surely written o'er An older fib erased before . So from these days I fly to those That in the landlocked Past repose , Where no rude wind of doctrine shakes From bloom-flushed boughs untimely flakes ; Where morning 's eyes see nothing strange , No crude perplexity of change , And morrows trip along their ways Secure as happy yesterdays . 40 Then there were rulers who could trace Through heroes up to gods their race , Pledged to fair fame and noble use By veins from Odin filled or Zeus , And under bonds to keep divine The praise of a celestial line . Then priests could pile the altar 's sods , With whom gods spake as they with gods , And everywhere from haunted earth Broke springs of wonder , that had birth 50 In depths divine beyond the ken And fatal scrutiny of men ; Then hills and groves and streams and seas Thrilled with immortal presences , Not too ethereal for the scope Of human passion 's dream or hope . Now Pan at last is surely dead , And King No-Credit reigns instead , Whose officers , morosely strict , Poor Fancy 's tenantry evict , 60 Chase the last Genius from the door , And nothing dances any more . Nothing ? Ah , yes , our tables do , Dramming the Old One 's own tattoo , And , if the oracles are dumb , Have we not mediums ! Why be glum ? Fly thither ? Why , the very air Is full of hindrance and despair ! Fly thither ? But I cannot fly ; My doubts enmesh me if I try , 70 Each Liliputian , but , combined , Potent a giant 's limbs to bind . This world and that are growing dark ; A huge interrogation mark , The Devil 's crook episcopal . Still borne before him since the Fall , Blackens with its ill-omened sign The old blue heaven of faith benign . Whence ? Whither ? Wherefore ? How ? Which ? Why ? All ask at once , all wait reply . 80 Men feel old systems cracking under ‘ em ; Life saddens to a mere conundrum Which once Religion solved , but she Has lost — has Science found ?— the key . What was snow-bearded Odin , trow , The mighty hunter long ago , Whose horn and hounds the peasant hears Still when the Northlights shake their spears ? Science hath answers twain , I 've heard ; Choose which you will , nor hope a third ; 90 Whichever box the truth be stowed in , There 's not a sliver left of Odin . Either he was a pinchbrowed thing , With scarcely wit a stone to fling , A creature both in size and shape Nearer than we are to the ape , Who hung sublime with brat and spouse By tail prehensile from the boughs , And , happier than his maimed descendants , The culture-curtailed independents , 100 Could pluck his cherries with both paws , And stuff with both his big-boned jaws ; Or else the core his name enveloped Was from a solar myth developed , Which , hunted to its primal shoot , Takes refuge in a Sanskrit root , Thereby to instant death explaining The little poetry remaining . Try it with Zeus , ‘ tis just the same ; The thing evades , we hug a name ; 110 Nay , scarcely that ,— perhaps a vapor Born of some atmospheric caper . All Lempriere 's fables blur together In cloudy symbols of the weather , And Aphrodite rose from frothy seas But to illustrate such hypotheses . With years enough behind his back , Lincoln will take the selfsame track , And prove , hulled fairly to the cob , A mere vagary of Old Prob . 120 Give the right man a solar myth , And he 'll confute the sun therewith . They make things admirably plain , But one hard question will remain : If one hypothesis you lose , Another in its place you choose , But , your faith gone , O man and brother , Whose shop shall furnish you another ? One that will wash , I mean , and wear , And wrap us warmly from despair ? 130 While they are clearing up our puzzles , And clapping prophylactic muzzles On the Actæon 's hounds that sniff Our devious track through But and If , Would they 'd explain away the Devil And other facts that wo n't keep level , But rise beneath our feet or fail , A reeling ship 's deck in a gale ! God vanished long ago , iwis , A mere subjective synthesis ; 140 A doll , stuffed out with hopes and fears , Too homely for us pretty dears , Who want one that conviction carries , Last make of London or of Paris . He gone , I felt a moment 's spasm , But calmed myself , with Protoplasm , A finer name , and , what is more , As enigmatic as before ; Greek , too , and sure to fill with ease Minds caught in the Symplegades 150 Of soul and sense , life 's two conditions , Each baffled with its own omniscience . The men who labor to revise Our Bibles will , I hope , be wise , And print it without foolish qualms Instead of God in David 's psalms : Noll had been more effective far Could he have shouted at Dunbar , ‘ Rise , Protoplasm ! ’ No dourest Scot Had waited for another shot . 160 And yet I frankly must confess A secret unforgivingness , And shudder at the saving chrism Whose best New Birth is Pessimism ; My soul — I mean the bit of phosphorus That fills the place of what that was for us — Ca n't bid its inward bores defiance With the new nursery-tales of science . What profits me , though doubt by doubt , As nail by nail , be driven out , 170 When every new one , like the last , Still holds my coffin-lid as fast ? Would I find thought a moment 's truce , Give me the young world 's Mother Goose With life and joy in every limb , The chimney-corner tales of Grimm ! Our dear and admirable Huxley Cannot explain to me why ducks lay , Or , rather , how into their eggs Blunder potential wings and legs 180 With will to move them and decide Whether in air or lymph to glide . Who gets a hair'shYpppHeNbreadth on by showing That Something Else set all agoing ? Farther and farther back we push From Moses and his burning bush ; Cry , ‘ Art Thou there ? ’ Above , below , All Nature mutters yes and no ! ‘ Tis the old answer : we 're agreed Being from Being must proceed , 190 Life be Life 's source . I might as well Obey the meeting-house 's bell , And listen while Old Hundred pours Forth through the summer-opened doors , From old and young . I hear it yet , Swelled by bass-viol and clarinet , While the gray minister , with face Radiant , let loose his noble bass . If Heaven it reached not , yet its roll Waked all the echoes of the soul , 200 And in it many a life found wings To soar away from sordid things . Church gone and singers too , the song Sings to me voiceless all night long , Till my soul beckons me afar , Glowing and trembling like a star . Will any scientific touch With my worn strings achieve as much ? I do n't object , not I , to know My sires were monkeys , if ‘ twas so ; 210 I touch my ear 's collusive tip And own the poor-relationship . That apes of various shapes and sizes Contained their germs that all the prizes Of senate , pulpit , camp , and bar win May give us hopes that sweeten Darwin . Who knows but from our loins may spring ( Long hence ) some winged sweet-throated thing As much superior to us As we to Cynocephalus ? 220 This is consoling , but , alas , It wipes no dimness from the glass Where I am flattening my poor nose , In hope to see beyond my toes , Though I accept my pedigree , Yet where , pray tell me , is the key That should unlock a private door To the Great Mystery , such no more ? Each offers his , but one nor all Are much persuasive with the wall 230 That rises now as long ago , Between I wonder and I know , Nor will vouchsafe a pin-hole peep At the veiled Isis in its keep . Where is no door , I but produce My key to find it of no use . Yet better keep it , after all , Since Nature 's economical , And who can tell but some fine day ( If it occur to her ) she may , 240 In her good-will to you and me , Make door and lock to match the key ? TEMPORA MUTANTUR The world turns mild ; democracy , they say , Rounds the sharp knobs of character away , And no great harm , unless at grave expense Of what needs edge of proof , the moral sense ; For man or race is on the downward path Whose fibre grows too soft for honest wrath , And there 's a subtle influence that springs From words to modify our sense of things . A plain distinction grows obscure of late : Man , if he will , may pardon ; but the State 10 Forgets its function if not fixed as Fate . So thought our sires : a hundred years ago , If men were knaves , why , people called them so , And crime could see the prison-portal bend Its brow severe at no long vista 's end . In those days for plain things plain words would serve ; Men had not learned to admire the graceful swerve Wherewith the Æsthetic Nature 's genial mood Makes public duty slope to private good ; No muddled conscience raised the saving doubt ; 20 A soldier proved unworthy was drummed out , An officer cashiered , a civil servant ( No matter though his piety were fervent ) Disgracefully dismissed , and through the land Each bore for life a stigma from the brand Whose far-heard hiss made others more averse To take the facile step from bad to worse . The Ten Commandments had a meaning then , Felt in their bones by least considerate men , Because behind them Public Conscience stood , 30 And without wincing made their mandates good . But now that ‘ Statesmanship ’ is just a way To dodge the primal curse and make it pay , Since office means a kind of patent drill To force an entrance to the Nation 's till , And peculation something rather less Risky than if you spelt it with an s ; Now that to steal by law is grown an art , Whom rogues the sires , their milder sons call smart , And ‘ slightly irregular ’ dilutes the shame 40 Of what had once a somewhat blunter name . With generous curve we draw the moral line : Our swindlers are permitted to resign ; Their guilt is wrapped in deferential names , And twenty sympathize for one that blames . Add national disgrace to private crime , Confront mankind with brazen front sublime , Steal but enough , the world is un-severe ,— Tweed is a statesman , Fisk a financier ; Invent a mine , and he — the Lord knows what ; 50 Secure , at any rate , with what you 've got . The public servant who has stolen or lied , If called on , may resign with honest pride : As unjust favor put him in , why doubt Disfavor as unjust has turned him out ? Even it indicted , what is that but fudge To him who counted-in the elective judge ? Whitewashed , he quits the politician 's strife At ease in mind , with pockets filled for life ; His ‘ lady ’ glares with gems whose vulgar blaze 60 The poor man through his heightened taxes pays , Himself content if one huge Kohinoor Bulge from a shirt-front ampler than before , But not too candid , lest it haply tend To rouse suspicion of the People 's Friend . A public meeting , treated at his cost , Resolves him back more virtue than he lost ; With character regilt he counts his gains ; What 's gone was air , the solid good remains ; For what is good , except what friend and foe 70 Seem quite unanimous in thinking so , The stocks and bonds which , in our age of loans , Replace the stupid pagan 's stocks and stones ? With choker white , wherein no cynic eye Dares see idealized a hempen tie , At parish-meetings he conducts in prayer , And pays for missions to be sent elsewhere ; On ‘ Change respected , to his friends endeared , Add but a Sunday-school class , he 's revered , And his too early tomb will not be dumb 80 To point a moral for our youth to come . IN THE HALF-WAY HOUSE I At twenty we fancied the blest Middle Ages A spirited cross of romantic and grand , All templars and minstrels and ladies and pages , And love and adventure in Outre-Mer land ; But ah , where the youth dreamed of building a minster , The man takes a pew and sits reckoning his pelf , And the Graces wear fronts , the Muse thins to a spinster , When Middle-Age stares from one 's glass at oneself ! II Do you twit me with days when I had an Ideal , And saw the sear future through spectacles green ? Then find me some charm , while I look round and see all These fat friends of forty , shall keep me nineteen ; Should we go on pining for chaplets of laurel Who 've paid a perruquier for mending our thatch , Or , our feet swathed in baize , with our Fate pick a quarrel , If , instead of cheap bay-leaves , she sent a dear scratch ? III We called it our Eden , that small patent-baker , When life was half moonshine and half Mary Jane ; But the butcher , the baker , the candlestick-maker !— Did Adam have duns and slip down a back-lane ? Nay , after the Fall did the modiste keep coming With the last styles of fig-leaf to Madam Eve 's bower ? Did Jubal , or whoever taught the girls thrumming , Make the patriarchs deaf at a dollar the hour ? IV As I think what I was , I sigh Desunt nonnulla ! Years are creditors Sheridan 's self could not bilk ; But then , as my boy says , ‘ What right has a fullah To ask for the cream , when himself spilt the milk ? ’ Perhaps when you 're older , my lad , you 'll discover The secret with which Auld Lang Syne there is gilt ,— Superstition of old man , maid , poet , and lover ,— That cream rises thickest on milk that was spilt ! V We sailed for the moon , but , in sad disillusion , Snug under Point Comfort are glad to make fast , And strive ( sans our glasses ) to make a confusion ‘ Twixt our rind of green cheese and the moon of the past . Ah , Might-have-been , Could-have-been , Would-have-been ! rascals , He 's a genius or fool whom ye cheat at two-score , And the man whose boy-promise was likened to Pascal 's Is thankful at forty they do n't call him bore ! VI With what fumes of fame was each confident pate full ! How rates of insurance should rise on the Charles ! And which of us now would not feel wisely grateful , If his rhymes sold as fast as the Emblems of Quarles ? E'en if won , what 's the good of Life 's medals and prizes ? The rapture 's in what never was or is gone ; That we missed them makes Helens of plain Ann Elizys , For the goose of To-day still is Memory 's swan . VII And yet who would change the old dream for new treasure ? Make not youth 's sourest grapes the best wine of our life ? Need he reckon his date by the Almanac 's measure Who is twenty life-long in the eyes of his wife ? Ah , Fate , should I live to be nonagenarian , Let me still take Hope 's frail I. O. U . ' s upon trust , Still talk of a trip to the Islands Macarian , And still climb the dream-tree for — ashes and dust ! AT THE BURNS CENTENNIAL JANUARY , 1859 I A hundred years ! they 're quickly fled , With all their joy and sorrow ; Their dead leaves shed upon the dead , Their fresh ones sprung by morrow ! And still the patient seasons bring Their change of sun and shadow ; New birds still sing with every spring , New violets spot the meadow . II A hundred years ! and Nature 's powers No greater grown nor lessened ! 10 They saw no flowers more sweet than ours , No fairer new moon 's crescent . Would she but treat us poets so , So from our winter free us , And set our slow old sap aflow To sprout in fresh ideas ! III Alas , think I , what worth or parts Have brought me here competing , To speak what starts in myriad hearts With Burns 's memory beating ! 20 Himself had loved a theme like this ; Must I be its entomber ? No pen save his but 's sure to miss Its pathos or its humor . IV As I sat musing what to say , And how my verse to number , Some elf in play passed by that way , And sank my lids in slumber ; And on my sleep a vision stole . Which I will put in metre , 30 Of Burns 's soul at the wicket-hole Where sits the good Saint Peter . V The saint , methought , had left his post That day to Holy Willie , Who swore , ‘ Each ghost that comes shall toast In brunstane , will he , nill he ; There 's nane need hope with phrases fine Their score to wipe a sin frae ; I 'll chalk a sign , to save their tryin ’ ,— A hand ([ Illustration of a hand ]) and “ Vide infra ! " ’ 40 VI Alas ! no soil 's too cold or dry For spiritual small potatoes , Scrimped natures , spry the trade to ply Of diaboli advocatus ; Who lay bent pins in the penance-stool Where Mercy plumps a cushion , Who 've just one rule for knave and fool , It saves so much confusion ! VII So when Burns knocked , Will knit his brows , His window gap made scanter , 50 And said , ‘ Go rouse the other house ; We lodge no Tam O'Shanter ! ’ ‘ We lodge ! ’ laughed Burns . ‘ Now well I see Death cannot kill old nature ; No human flea but thinks that he May speak for his Creator ! VIII ‘ But , Willie , friend , do n't turn me forth , Auld Clootie needs no gauger ; And if on earth I had small worth , You 've let in worse I'se wager ! ’ 60 ‘ Na , nane has knockit at the yett But found me hard as whunstane ; There 's chances yet your bread to get Wi Auld Nick , gaugin ’ brunstane . ’ IX Meanwhile , the Unco ’ Guid had ta'en Their place to watch the process , Flattening in vain on many a pane Their disembodied noses . Remember , please , ‘ tis all a dream ; One can n't control the fancies 70 Through sleep that stream with wayward gleam , Like midnight 's boreal dances . X Old Willie 's tone grew sharp ‘ s a knife : ‘ In primis , I indite ye , For makin ’ strife wi ’ the water o ’ life , And preferrin ’ aqua vitæ ! ’ Then roared a voice with lusty din , Like a skipper 's when ‘ tis blowy , ‘ If that 's a sin , I 'd ne'er got in , As sure as my name 's Noah ! ’ 80 XI Baulked , Willie turned another leaf ,— ‘ There 's many here have heard ye , To the pain and grief o ’ true belief , Say hard things o ’ the clergy ! ’ Then rang a clear tone over all ,— ‘ One plea for him allow me : I once heard call from o'er me , “ Saul , Why persecutest thou me ? " ’ XII To the next charge vexed Willie turned , And , sighing , wiped his glasses : 90 ‘ I 'm much concerned to find ye yearned O'erhYpppHeNwarmly tow'rd the lasses ! ’ Here David sighed ; poor Willie 's face Lost all its self-possession : ‘ I leave this case to God 's own grace ; It baffles my discretion ! ’ XIII Then sudden glory round me broke , And low melodious surges Of wings whose stroke to splendor woke Creation 's farthest verges ; 100 A cross stretched , ladder-like , secure From earth to heaven 's own portal , Whereby God 's poor , with footing sure , Climbed up to peace immortal . XIV I heard a voice serene and low ( With my heart I seemed to hear it ,) Fall soft and slow as snow on snow , Like grace of the heavenly spirit ; As sweet as over new-born son The croon of new-made mother , 110 The voice begun , ‘ Sore tempted one ! ’ Then , pausing , sighed , ‘ Our brother ! XV ‘ If not a sparrow fall , unless The Father sees and knows it , Think ! recks He less his form express , The soul his own deposit ? If only dear to Him the strong , That never trip nor wander , Where were the throng whose morning song Thrills his blue arches yonder ? 120 XVI ‘ Do souls alone clear-eyed , strong-kneed , To Him true service render , And they who need his hand to lead , Find they his heart untender ? Through all your various ranks and fates He opens doors to duty , And he that waits there at your gates Was servant of his Beauty . XVII ‘ The Earth must richer sap secrete , ( Could ye in time but know it ! ) 130 Must juice concrete with fiercer heat , Ere she can make her poet ; Long generations go and come , At last she bears a singer , For ages dumb of senses numb The compensation-bringer ! XVIII ‘ Her cheaper broods in palaces She raises under glasses , But souls like these , heav'n ' s hostages , Spring shelterless as grasses : 140 They share Earth 's blessing and her bane , The common sun and shower ; What makes your pain to them is gain , Your weakness is their power . XIX ‘ These larger hearts must feel the rolls Of stormier-waved temptation ; These star-wide souls between their poles Bear zones of tropic passion . He loved much !— that is gospel good , Howe'er the text you handle ; 150 From common wood the cross was hewed , By love turned priceless sandal . XX ‘ If scant his service at the kirk , He paters heard and aves From choirs that lurk in hedge and birk , From blackbird and from mavis ; The cowering mouse , poor unroofed thing , In him found Mercy 's angel ; The daisy 's ring brought every spring To him love 's fresh evangel ! 160 XXI ‘ Not he the threatening texts who deals Is highest ‘ mong the preachers , But he who feels the woes and weals Of all God 's wandering creatures . He doth good work whose heart can find The spirit ‘ neath the letter ; Who makes his kind of happier mind , Leaves wiser men and better . XXII ‘ They make Religion be abhorred Who round with darkness gulf her , 170 And think no word can please the Lord Unless it smell of sulphur , Dear Poet-heart , that childlike guessed The Father 's loving kindness , Come now to rest ! Thou didst his hest , If haply ‘ twas in blindness ! ’ XXIII Then leapt heaven 's portals wide apart , And at their golden thunder With sudden start I woke , my heart Still throbbing-full of wonder . 180 ‘ Father , ’ I said , ‘'tis known to Thee How Thou thy Saints preparest ; But this I see ,— Saint Charity Is still the first and fairest ! ’ XXIV Dear Bard and Brother ! let who may Against thy faults be railing , ( Though far , I pray , from us be they That never had a failing ! ) One toast I 'll give , and that not long , Which thou wouldst pledge if present , 190 To him whose song , in nature strong , Makes man of prince and peasant ! IN AN ALBUM The misspelt scrawl , upon the wall By some Pompeian idler traced , In ashes packed ( ironic fact ! ) Lies eighteen centuries uneffaced , While many a page of bard and sage , Deemed once mankind 's immortal gain , Lost from Time 's ark , leaves no more mark Than a keel 's furrow through the main . O Chance and Change ! our buzz 's range Is scarcely wider than a fly 's ; Then let us play at fame to-day , To-morrow be unknown and wise ; And while the fair beg locks of hair , And autographs , and Lord knows what , Quick ! let us scratch our moment 's match , Make our brief blaze , and be forgot ! Too pressed to wait , upon her slate Fame writes a name or two in doubt ; Scarce written , these no longer please , And her own finger rubs them out : It may ensue , fair girl , that you Years hence this yellowing leaf may see , And put to task , your memory ask In vain , ‘ This Lowell , who was he ? ’ AT THE COMMENCEMENT DINNER , 1866 IN ACKNOWLEDGING A TOAST TO THE SMITH PROFESSOR I rise , Mr. Chairman , as both of us know , With the impromptu I promised you three weeks ago , Dragged up to my doom by your might and my mane , To do what I vowed I 'd do never again : And I feel like your good honest dough when possest By a stirring , impertinent devil of yeast . ‘ You must rise , ’ says the leaven . ‘ I can n't , ’ says the dough ; ‘ Just examine my bumps , and you 'll see it 's no go . ’ ‘ But you must , ’ the tormentor insists , ‘'tis all right ; You must rise when I bid you , and , what 's more , be light . ’ 10 ‘ Tis a dreadful oppression , this making men speak What they 're sure to be sorry for all the next week ; Some poor stick requesting , like Aaron 's , to bud Into eloquence , pathos , or wit in cold blood , As if the dull brain that you vented your spite on Could be got , like an ox , by mere poking , to Brighton . They say it is wholesome to rise with the sun , And I dare say it may be if not overdone ; ( I think it was Thomson who made the remark ‘ Twas an excellent thing in its way — for a lark ;) 20 But to rise after dinner and look down the meeting On a distant ( as Gray calls it ) prospect of Eating , With a stomach half full and a cerebrum hollow As the tortoise-shell ere it was strung for Apollo , Undercontract to raise anerithmon gelasma With rhymes so hard hunted they gasp with the asthma , And jokes not much younger than Jethro 's phylacteries , Is something I leave you yourselves to characterize . I 've a notion , I think , of a good dinner speech , Tripping light as a sandpiper over the beach , 30 Swerving this way and that as the wave of the moment Washes out its slight trace with a dash of whim 's foam on ‘ t , And leaving on memory 's rim just a sense Something graceful had gone by , a live present tense ; Not poetry ,— no , not quite that , but as good , A kind of winged prose that could fly if it would . ‘ Tis a time for gay fancies as fleeting and vain As the whisper of foam-beads on fresh-poured champagne , Since dinners were not perhaps strictly designed For manoeuvring the heavy dragoons of the mind . 40 When I hear your set speeches that start with a pop , Then wander and maunder , too feeble to stop , With a vague apprehension from popular rumor There used to be something by mortals called humor , Beginning again when you thought they were done , Respectable , sensible , weighing a ton , And as near to the present occasions of men As a Fast Day discourse of the year eighteen ten , I — well , I sit still , and my sentiments smother , For am I not also a bore and a brother ? 50 And a toast ,— what should that , be ? Light , airy , and free , The foam-Aphrodite of Bacchus 's sea , A fancy-tinged bubble , an orbed rainbow-stain , That floats for an instant ‘ twixt goblet and brain ; A breath-born perfection , half something , half naught , And breaks if it strike the hard edge of a thought . Do you ask me to make such ? Ah no , not so simple ; Ask Apelles to paint you the ravishing dimple Whose shifting enchantment lights Venus 's cheek , And the artist will tell you his skill is to seek ; 60 Once fix it , ‘ tis naught , for the charm of it rises From the sudden bopeeps of its smiling surprises . I 've tried to define it , but what mother 's son Could ever yet do what he knows should be done ? My rocket has burst , and I watch in the air Its fast-fading heart'shYpppHeNblood drop back in despair ; Yet one chance is left me , and , if I am quick , I can palm off , before you suspect me , the stick . Now since I 've succeeded — I pray do not frown — To Ticknor 's and Longfellow 's classical gown , 70 And profess four strange languages , which , luckless elf , I speak like a native ( of Cambridge ) myself , Let me beg , Mr. President , leave to propose A sentiment treading on nobody 's toes , And give , in such ale as with pump-handles we brew , Their memory who saved us from all talking Hebrew ,— A toast that to deluge with water is good , For in Scripture they come in just after the flood : I give you the men but for whom , as I guess , sir , Modern languages ne'er could have had a professor , 80 The builders of Babel , to whose zeal the lungs Of the children of men owe confusion of tongues ; And a name all-embracing I couple therewith , Which is that of my founder — the late Mr. Smith . A PARABLE An ass munched thistles , while a nightingale From passion 's fountain flooded all the vale . ‘ Hee-haw ! ’ cried he , ‘ I hearken , ’ as who knew For such ear-largess humble thanks were due . ‘ Friend , ’ said the wingèd pain , ‘ in vain you bray , Who tunnels bring , not cisterns , for my lay ; None but his peers the poet rightly hear , Nor mete we listeners by their length of ear . ’ V. EPIGRAMS SAYINGS 1 . In life 's small things be resolute and great To keep thy muscle trained : know'st thou when Fate Thy measure takes , or when she 'll say to thee , ‘ I find thee worthy ; do this deed for me ’ ? 2 . A camel-driver , angry with his drudge , Beating him , called him hunchback ; to the hind Thus spake a dervish : ‘ Friend , the Eternal Judge Dooms not his work , but ours , the crooked mind . ’ 3 .

FOR A MEMORIAL WINDOW TO SIR WALTER RALEIGH , SET UP IN ST. MARGARET 'S , WESTMINSTER , BY AMERICAN CONTRIBUTORS The New World 's sons , from England 's breasts we drew Such milk as bids remember whence we came ; Proud of her Past , wherefrom our Present grew , This window we inscribe with Raleigh 's name . PROPOSED FOR A SOLDIERS ’ AND SAILORS ’ MONUMENT IN BOSTON To those who died for her on land and sea , That she might have a country great and free , Boston builds this : build ye her monument In lives like theirs , at duty 's summons spent .

SUN-WORSHIP If I were the rose at your window , Happiest rose of its crew , Every blossom I bore would bend inward , They 'd know where the sunshine grew .

SIXTY-EIGHTH BIRTHDAY As life runs on , the road grows strange With faces new , and near the end The milestones into headstones change , ‘ Neath every one a friend . INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT In vain we call old notions fudge , And bend our conscience to our dealing ; The Ten Commandments will not budge , And stealing will continue stealing . LAST POEMS HOW I CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF THE GOLDFISHES What know we of the world immense Beyond the narrow ring of sense ? What should we know , who lounge about The house we dwell in , nor find out , Masked by a wall , the secret cell Where the soul 's priests in hiding dwell ? The winding stair that steals aloof To chapel-mysteries ‘ neath the roof ? It lies about us , yet as far From sense sequestered as a star 10 New launched its wake of fire to trace In secrecies of unprobed space , Whose beacon 's lightning-pinioned spears Might earthward haste a thousand years Nor reach it . So remote seems this World undiscovered , yet it is A neighbor near and dumb as death , So near , we seem to feel the breath Of its hushed habitants as they Pass us unchallenged , night and day . 20 Never could mortal ear nor eye By sound or sign suspect them nigh , Yet why may not some subtler sense Than those poor two give evidence ? Transfuse the ferment of their being Into our own , past hearing , seeing , As men , if once attempered so , Far off each other 's thought can know ? As horses with an instant thrill Measure their rider 's strength of will ? 30 Comes not to all some glimpse that brings Strange sense of sense-escaping things ? Wraiths some transfigured nerve divines ? Approaches , premonitions , signs , Voices of Ariel that die out In the dim No Man 's Land of Doubt ? Are these Night 's dusky birds ? Are these Phantasmas of the silences Outer or inner ?— rude heirlooms From grovellers in the cavern-glooms , 40 Who in unhuman Nature saw Misshapen foes with tusk and claw , And with those night-fears brute and blind Peopled the chaos of their mind , Which , in ungovernable hours , Still make their bestial lair in ours ? Were they , or were they not ? Yes ; no ; Uncalled they come , unbid they go , And leave us fumbling in a doubt Whether within us or without 50 The spell of this illusion be That witches us to hear and see As in a twi-life what it will , And hath such wonder-working skill That what we deemed most solid-wrought Turns a mere figment of our thought , Which when we grasp at in despair Our fingers find vain semblance there , For Psyche seeks a corner-stone Firmer than aught to matter known . 60 Is it illusion ? Dream-stuff ? Show Made of the wish to have it so ? ‘ Twere something , even though this were all : So the poor prisoner , on his wall Long gazing , from the chance designs Of crack , mould , weather-stain , refines New and new pictures without cease , Landscape , or saint , or altar-piece : But these are Fancy 's common brood Hatched in the nest of solitude ; 70 This is Dame Wish 's hourly trade , By our rude sires a goddess made . Could longing , though its heart broke , give Trances in which we chiefly live ? Moments that darken all beside , Tearfully radiant as a bride ? Beckonings of bright escape , of wings Purchased with loss of baser things ? Blithe truancies from all control Of Hylë , outings of the soul ? 80 The worm , by trustful instinct led , Draws from its womb a slender thread , And drops , confiding that the breeze Will waft it to unpastured trees : So the brain spins itself , and so Swings boldly off in hope to blow Across some tree of knowledge , fair With fruitage new , none else shall share : Sated with wavering in the Void , It backward climbs , so best employed , 90 And , where no proof is nor can be , Seeks refuge with Analogy ; Truth 's soft half-sister , she may tell Where lurks , seld-sought , the other 's well , With metaphysic midges sore , My Thought seeks comfort at her door , And , at her feet a suppliant cast , Evokes a spectre of the past . Not such as shook the knees of Saul , But winsome , golden-gay withal ,— 100 Two fishes in a globe of glass , That pass , and waver , and re-pass , And lighten that way , and then this , Silent as meditation is . With a half-humorous smile I see In this their aimless industry , These errands nowhere and returns Grave as a pair of funeral urns , This ever-seek and never-find , A mocking image of my mind . 110 But not for this I bade you climb Up from the darkening deeps of time : Help me to tame these wild day-mares That sudden on me unawares . Fish , do your duty , as did they Of the Black Island far away In life 's safe places ,— far as you From all that now I see or do . You come , embodied flames , as when I knew you first , nor yet knew men ; 120 Your gold renews my golden days , Your splendor all my loss repays . ‘ Tis more than sixty years ago Since first I watched your to-and-fro ; Two generations come and gone From silence to oblivion , With all their noisy strife and stress Lulled in the grave 's forgivingness , While you unquenchably survive Immortal , almost more alive . 130 I watched you then a curious boy , Who in your beauty found full joy , And , by no problem-debts distrest , Sate at life 's board a welcome guest . You were my sister 's pets , not mine ; But Property 's dividing line No hint of dispossession drew On any map my simplesse knew ; O golden age , not yet dethroned ! What made me happy , that I owned ; 140 You were my wonders , you my Lars , In darkling days my sun and stars , And over you entranced I hung , Too young to know that I was young . Gazing with still unsated bliss , My fancies took some shape like this : ‘ I have my world , and so have you , A tiny universe for two , A bubble by the artist blown , Scarcely more fragile than our own , 150 Where you have all a whale could wish , Happy as Eden 's primal fish . Manna is dropt you thrice a day From some kind heaven not far away , And still you snatch its softening crumbs , Nor , more than we , think whence it comes . No toil seems yours but to explore Your cloistered realm from shore to shore ; Sometimes you trace its limits round , Sometimes its limpid depths you sound , 160 Or hover motionless midway , Like gold-red clouds at set of day ; Erelong you whirl with sudden whim Off to your globe 's most distant rim , Where , greatened by the watery lens , Methinks no dragon of the fens Flashed huger scales against the sky , Roused by Sir Bevis or Sir Guy , And the one eye that meets my view , Lidless and strangely largening , too , 170 Like that of conscience in the dark , Seems to make me its single mark . What a benignant lot is yours That have an own All-out-of-doors , No words to spell , no sums to do , No Nepos and no parlyvoo ! How happy you without a thought Of such cross things as Must and Ought ,— I too the happiest of boys To see and share your golden joys ! ’ 180 So thought the child , in simpler words , Of you his finny flocks and herds ; Now , an old man , I bid you rise To the fine sight behind the eyes , And , lo , you float and flash again In the dark cistern of my brain . But o'er your visioned flames I brood With other mien , in other mood ; You are no longer there to please , But to stir argument , and tease 190 My thought with all the ghostly shapes From which no moody man escapes . Diminished creature , I no more Find Fairyland beside my door , But for each moment 's pleasure pay With the quart d'heure of Rabelais ! I watch you in your crystal sphere , And wonder if you see and hear Those shapes and sounds that stir the wide Conjecture of the world outside ; 200 In your pent lives , as we in ours , Have you surmises dim of powers , Of presences obscurely shown , Of lives a riddle to your own , Just on the senses ’ outer verge , Where sense-nerves into soul-nerves merge , Where we conspire our own deceit Confederate in deft Fancy 's feat , And the fooled brain befools the eyes With pageants woven of its own lies ? 210 But are they lies ? Why more than those Phantoms that startle your repose , Half seen , half heard , then flit away , And leave you your prose-bounded day ? The things ye see as shadows I Know to be substance ; tell me why My visions , like those haunting you , May not be as substantial too . Alas , who ever answer heard From fish , and dream-fish too ? Absurd ! 220 Your consciousness I half divine , But you are wholly deaf to mine . Go , I dismiss you ; ye have done All that ye could ; our silk is spun : Dive back into the deep of dreams , Where what is real is what , seems ! Yet I shall fancy till my grave Your lives to mine a lesson gave ; If lesson none , an image , then , Impeaching self-conceit in men 230 Who put their confidence alone In what they call the Seen and Known . How seen ? How known ? As through your glass Our wavering apparitions pass Perplexingly , then subtly wrought To some quite other thing by thought . Here shall my resolution be : The shadow of the mystery Is haply wholesomer for eyes That cheat us to be overwise , 240 And I am happy in my right To love God 's darkness as His light . TURNER 'S OLD TÉMÉRAIRE UNDER A FIGURE SYMBOLIZING THE CHURCH Thou wast the fairest of all man-made things ; The breath of heaven bore up thy cloudy wings , And , patient in their triple rank , The thunders crouched about thy flank , Their black lips silent with the doom of kings . The storm-wind loved to rock him in thy pines , And swell thy vans with breath of great designs ; Long-wildered pilgrims of the main By thee relaid their course again , Whose prow was guided by celestial signs . How didst thou trample on tumultuous seas , Or , like some basking sea-beast stretched at ease , Let the bull-fronted surges glide Caressingly along thy side , Like glad hounds leaping by the huntsman 's knees ! Heroic feet , with fire of genius shod , In battle 's ecstasy thy deck have trod , While from their touch a fulgor ran Through plank and spar , from man to man , Welding thee to a thunderbolt of God . Now a black demon , belching fire and steam , Drags thee away , a pale , dismantled dream , And all thy desecrated bulk Must landlocked lie , a helpless hulk , To gather weeds in the regardless stream . Woe 's me , from Ocean 's sky-horizoned air To this ! Better , the flame-cross still aflare , Shot-shattered to have met thy doom Where thy last lightnings cheered the gloom , Than here be safe in dangerless despair . Thy drooping symbol to the flag-staff clings , Thy rudder soothes the tide to lazy rings , Thy thunders now but birthdays greet , Thy planks forget the martyrs ’ feet , Thy masts what challenges the sea-wind brings . Thou a mere hospital , where human wrecks , Like winter-flies , crawl , those renowned decks , Ne'er trodden save by captive foes , And wonted sternly to impose God 's will and thine on bowed imperial necks ! Shall nevermore , engendered of thy fame , A new sea-eagle heir thy conqueror name . And with commissioned talons wrench From thy supplanter 's grimy clench His sheath of steel , his wings of smoke and flame ? This shall the pleased eyes of our children see ; For this the stars of God long even as we ; Earth listens for his wings ; the Fates Expectant lean ; Faith cross-propt waits , And the tired waves of Thought 's insurgent sea . ST. MICHAEL THE WEIGHER Stood the tall Archangel weighing All man 's dreaming , doing , saying , All the failure and the pain , All the triumph and the gain , In the unimagined years , Full of hopes , more full of tears , Since old Adam 's hopeless eyes Backward searched for Paradise , And , instead , the flame-blade saw Of inexorable Law . Waking , I beheld him there , With his fire-gold , flickering hair , In his blinding armor stand , And the scales were in his hand : Mighty were they , and full well They could poise both heaven and hell . ‘ Angel , ’ asked I humbly then , ‘ Weighest thou the souls of men ? That thine office is , I know . ’ ‘ Nay , ’ he answered me , ‘ not so ; But I weigh the hope of Man Since the power of choice began , In the world , of good or ill . ’ Then I waited and was still . In one scale I saw him place All the glories of our race , Cups that lit Belsbazzar 's feast , Gems , the lightning of the East , Kublai 's sceptre , Cæsar 's sword , Many a poet 's golden word , Many a skill of science , vain To make men as gods again . In the other scale he threw Things regardless , outcast , few , Martyr-ash , arena sand , Of St Francis ’ cord a strand , Beechen cups of men whose need Fasted that the poor might feed , Disillusions and despairs Of young saints with , grief-grayed hairs , Broken hearts that brake for Man . Marvel through my pulses ran Seeing then the beam divine Swiftly on this hand decline , While Earth 's splendor and renown Mounted light as thistle-down . A VALENTINE Let others wonder what fair face Upon their path shall shine , And , fancying half , half hoping , trace Some maiden shape of tenderest grace To be their Valentine . Let other hearts with tremor sweet One secret wish enshrine That Fate may lead their happy feet Fair Julia in the lane to meet To be their Valentine . But I , far happier , am secure ; I know the eyes benign , The face more beautiful and pure Than fancy 's fairest portraiture That mark my Valentine . More than when first I singled , thee , This only prayer is mine ,— That , in the years I yet shall see . As , darling , in the past , thou 'll be My happy Valentine . AN APRIL BIRTHDAY — AT SEA On this wild waste , where never blossom came , Save the white wind-flower to the billow 's cap , Or those pale disks of momentary flame , Loose petals dropped from Dian 's careless lap , What far fetched influence all my fancy fills , With singing birds and dancing daffodils ? Why , ‘ tis her day whom jocund April brought , And who brings April with her in her eyes ; It is her vision lights my lonely thought , Even as a rose that opes its hushed surprise In sick men 's chambers , with its glowing breath Plants Summer at the glacier edge of Death . Gray sky , sea gray as mossy stones on graves ;— Anon comes April in her jollity ; And dancing down the bleak vales ‘ tween the waves , Makes them green glades for all her flowers and me . The gulls turn thrushes , charmed are sea and sky By magic of my thought , and know not why . Ah , but I know , for never April 's shine , Nor passion gust of rain , nor all her flowers Scattered in haste , were seen so sudden fine As she in various mood , on whom the powers Of happiest stars in fair conjunction smiled To bless the birth , of April 's darling child . LOVE AND THOUGHT What hath Love with Thought to do ? Still at variance are the two . Love is sudden , Love is rash , Love is like the levin flash , Comes as swift , as swiftly goes , And his mark as surely knows . Thought is lumpish , Thought is slow , Weighing long ‘ tween yes and no ; When dear Love is dead and gone , Thought comes creeping in anon , And , in his deserted nest , Sits to hold the crowner 's quest . Since we love , what need to think ? Happiness stands on a brink Whence too easy ‘ tis to fall Whither 's no return at all ; Have a care , half-hearted lover , Thought would only push her over ! THE NOBLER LOVER If he be a nobler lover , take him ! You in you I seek , and not myself ; Love with men 's what women choose to make him , Seraph strong to soar , or fawn-eyed elf : All I am or can , your beauty gave it , Lifting me a moment nigh to you , And my bit of heaven , I fain would save it — Mine I thought it was , I never knew . What you take of me is yours to serve you , All I give , you gave to me before ; Let him win you ! If I but deserve you , I keep all you grant to him and more : You shall make me dare what others dare not , You shall keep my nature pure as snow , And a light from you that others share not Shall transfigure me where'er I go . Let me be your thrall ! However lowly Be the bondsman 's service I can do , Loyalty shall make it high and holy ; Naught can be unworthy , done for you . Men shall say , ‘ A lover of this fashion Such an icy mistress well beseems . ’ Women say , ‘ Could we deserve such passion , We might be the marvel that he dreams . ’ ON HEARING A SONATA OF BEETHOVEN 'S PLAYED IN THE NEXT ROOM Unseen Musician , thou art sure to please , For those same notes in happier days I heard Poured by dear hands that long have never stirred Yet now again for me delight the keys : Ah me , to strong illusions such as these What are Life 's solid things ? The walls that gird Our senses , lo , a casual scent or word Levels , and it is the soul that hears and sees ! Play on , dear girl , and many be the years Ere some grayhaired survivor sit like me And , for thy largess pay a meed of tears Unto another who , beyond the sea Of Time and Change , perhaps not sadly hears A music in this verse undreamed by thee ! VERSES INTENDED TO GO WITH A POSSET DISH TO MY DEAR LITTLE GODDAUGHTER , 1882 In good old times , which means , you know , The time men wasted long ago , And we must blame our brains or mood If that we squander seems less good , In those blest days when wish was act And fancy dreamed itself to fact , Godfathers used to fill with guineas The cups they gave their pickaninnies , Performing functions at the chrism Not mentioned in the Catechism . No millioner , poor I fill up With wishes my more modest cup , Though had I Amalthea 's horn It should be hers the newly born . Nay , shudder not ! I should bestow it So brimming full she could n't blow it . Wishes are n't horses : true , but still There are worse roadsters than goodwill . And so I wish my darling health , And just to round my couplet , wealth , With faith enough to bridge the chasm ‘ Twixt Genesis and Protoplasm , And bear her o'er life 's current vext From this world to a better next , Where the full glow of God puts out Poor reason 's farthing candle , Doubt . I 've wished her healthy , wealthy , wise , What more can godfather devise ? But since there 's room for countless wishes In these old-fashioned posset dishes , I 'll wish her from my plenteous store Of those commodities two more , Her father 's wit , veined through and through With tenderness that Watts ( but whew ! Celia 's aflame , I mean no stricture On his Sir Josh-surpassing picture ) — I wish her next , and ‘ tis the soul Of all I 've dropt into the bowl , Her mother 's beauty — nay , but two So fair at once would never do . Then let her but the half possess , Troy was besieged ten years for less . Now if there 's any truth in Darwin , And we from what was , all we are win , I simply wish the child to be A sample of Heredity , Enjoying to the full extent Life 's best , the Unearned Increment Which Fate her Godfather to flout Gave him in legacies of gout . Thus , then , the cup is duly filled ; Walk steady , dear , lest all be spilled . ON A BUST OF GENERAL GRANT Strong , simple , silent are the [ steadfast ] laws That sway this universe , of none withstood , Unconscious of man 's outcries or applause , Or what man deems his evil or his good ; And when the Fates ally them with a cause That wallows in the sea-trough and seems lost , Drifting in danger of the reefs and sands Of shallow counsels , this way , that way , tost , Strength , silence , simpleness , of these three strands They twist the cable shall the world hold fast To where its anchors clutch the bed-rock of the Past . Strong , simple , silent , therefore such was he Who helped us in our need ; the eternal law That who can saddle Opportunity Is God 's elect , though many a mortal flaw May minish him in eyes that closely see , Was verified in him : what need we say Of one who made success where others failed , Who , with no light save that of common day , Struck hard , and still struck on till Fortune quailed , But that ( so sift the Norns ) a desperate van Ne'er fell at last to one who was not wholly man . A face all prose where Time 's [ benignant ] haze Softens no raw edge yet , nor makes all fair With the beguiling light of vanished days ; This is relentless granite , bleak and bare , Roughhewn , and scornful of æsthetic phrase ; Nothing is here for fancy , naught for dreams , The Present 's hard uncompromising light Accents all vulgar outlines , flaws , and seams , Yet vindicates some pristine natural right O'ertopping that hereditary grace Which marks the gain or loss of some time-fondled race . So Marius looked , methinks , and Cromwell so , Not in the purple born , to those they led Nearer for that and costlier to the foe , New moulders of old forms , by nature bred The exhaustless life of manhood 's seeds to show , Let but the ploughshare of portentous times Strike deep enough to reach them where they lie ; Despair and danger are their fostering climes , And their best sun bursts from a stormy sky : He was our man of men , nor would abate The utmost due manhood could claim of fate . Nothing Ideal , a plain-people 's man At the first glance , a more deliberate ken Finds type primeval , theirs in whose veins ran Such blood as quelled the dragon In his den , Made harmless fields , and better worlds began : He came grim-silent , saw and did the deed That was to do ; in his master-grip Our sword flashed joy ; no skill of words could breed Such sure conviction as that close-clamped lip ; He slew our dragon , nor , so seemed it , knew He had done more than any simplest man might do . Yet did this man , war-tempered , stern as steel Where steel opposed , prove soft in civil sway ; The hand hilt-hardened had lost tact to feel The world 's base coin , and glozing knaves made prey Of him and of the entrusted Commonweal ; So Truth insists and will not be denied . We turn our eyes away , and so will Fame , As if in his last battle he had died Victor for us and spotless of all blame , Doer of hopeless tasks which praters shirk , One of those still plain men that do the world 's rough work .</p>

    <p n="1">I . INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND SERIES OF BIGLOW PAPERS</p>
   </div>
   <div type="otherbooks">
    <p>[ Lowell took occasion , when collecting in a book the several numbers of the second series of ‘ Biglow Papers , ’ which had appeared In the ‘ Atlantic Monthly , ’ to prefix an essay which not only gave a personal narrative of the origin of the whole scheme , but particularly dwelt upon the use in literature of the homely dialect in which the poems were couched . In this Cabinet Edition it has seemed expedient to print the Introduction here rather than in immediate connection with the poems themselves . ] Though prefaces seem of late to have fallen under some reproach , they have at least this advantage , that they set us again on the feet of our personal consciousness and rescue us from the gregarious mock-modesty or cowardice of that we which shrills feebly throughout modern literature like the shrieking of mice in the walls of a house that has passed its prime . Having a few words to say to the many friends whom the ‘ Biglow Papers ’ have won me , I shall accordingly take the freedom of the first person singular of the personal pronoun . Let each of the good-natured unknown who have cheered me by the written communication of their sympathy look upon this Introduction as a private letter to himself . When , more than twenty years ago , I wrote the first of the series , I had no definite plan and no intention of ever writing another . Thinking the Mexican war , as I think it still , a national crime committed in behoof of Slavery , our common sin , and wishing to put the feeling of those who thought as I did in a way that would tell , I imagined to myself such an up-country man as I had often seen at antislavery gatherings capable of district-school English , but always instinctively falling back into the natural stronghold of his homely dialect when heated to the point of self-forgetfulness . When I began to carry out my conception and to write in my assumed character , I found myself in a strait between two perils . On the one hand , I was in danger of being carried beyond the limit of my own opinions , or at least of that temper with which every man should speak his mind in print , and on the other I feared the risk of seeming to vulgarize a deep and sacred conviction . I needed on occasion to rise above the level of mere patois , and for this purpose conceived the Rev . Mr. Wilbur , who should express the more cautious element of the New England character and its pedantry , as Mr. Biglow should serve for its homely common-sense vivified and heated by conscience . The parson was to be the complement rather than the antithesis of his parishioner , and I felt or fancied a certain humorous element in the real identity of the two under a seeming incongruity . Mr. Wilbur 's fondness for scraps of Latin , though drawn from the life , I adopted deliberately to heighten the contrast . Finding soon after that I needed some one as a mouth-piece of the mere drollery , for I conceive that true humor is never divorced from moral conviction , I invented Mr. Sawin for the clown of my little puppet-show . I meant to embody in him that half-conscious unmorality which I had noticed as the recoil in gross natures from a puritanism that still strove to keep in its creed the intense savor which had long gone out of its faith and life . In the three I thought I should find room enough to express , as it was my plan to do , the popular feeling and opinion of the time . For the names of two of my characters , since I have received some remonstrances from very worthy persons who happen to bear them , I would say that they were purely fortuitous , probably mere unconscious memories of sign-boards or directories . Mr. Sawin 's sprang from the accident of a rhyme at the end of his first epistle , and I purposely christened him by the impossible surname of Birdofredum not more to stigmatize him as the incarnation of ‘ Manifest Destiny , ’ in other words , of national recklessness as to right and wrong , than to avoid the chance of wounding any private sensitiveness . The success of my experiment soon began not only to astonish me , but to make me feel the responsibility of knowing that I held in my hand a weapon instead of the mere fencing-stick I had supposed . Very far from being a popular author under my own name , so far , indeed , as to be almost unread , I found the verses of my pseudonym copied everywhere ; saw them pinned up in workshops ; I heard them quoted and their authorship debated ; I once even , when rumor had at length caught up my name in one of its eddies , had the satisfaction of overhearing it demonstrated , in the pauses of a concert , that I was utterly incompetent to have written anything of the kind . I had read too much not to know the utter worthlessness of contemporary reputation , especially as regards satire , but I knew also that by giving a certain amount of influence it also had its worth , if that influence were used on the right side . I had learned , too , that the first requisite of good writing is to have an earnest and definite purpose , whether æsthetic or moral , and that even good writing , to please long , must have more than an average amount either of imagination or common-sense . The first of these falls to the lot of scarcely one in several generations ; the last is within the reach of many in every one that passes ; and of this an author may fairly hope to become in part the mouthpiece . If I put on the cap and bells and made myself one of the court-fools of King Demos , it was less to make his majesty laugh than to win a passage to his royal ears for certain serious things which I had deeply at heart . I say this because there is no imputation that could be more galling to any man 's self-respect than that of being a mere jester . I endeavored , by generalising my satire , to give it what value I could beyond the passing moment and the immediate application . How far I have succeeded I cannot tell , but I have had better luck than I ever looked for in seeing my verses survive to pass beyond their nonage . In choosing the Yankee dialect , I did not act without forethought . It had long seemed to me that the great vice of American writing and speaking was a studied want of simplicity , that we were in danger of coming to look on our mother-tongue as a dead language , to be sought in the grammar and dictionary rather than in the heart , and that our only chance of escape was by seeking it at its living sources among those who were , as Scottowe says of Major-General Gibbons , ‘ divinely illiterate . ’ President Lincoln , the only really great public man whom these latter days have seen , was great also in this , that he was master — witness his speech at Gettysburg — of a truly masculine English , classic , because it was of no special period , and level at once to the highest and lowest of his countrymen . I learn from the highest authority that his favorite reading was in Shakespeare and Milton , to which , of course , the Bible should be added . But whoever should read the debates in Congress might fancy himself present at a meeting of the city council of some city of Southern Gaul in the decline of the Empire , where barbarians with a Latin varnish emulated each other in being more than Ciceronian . Whether it be want of culture , for the highest outcome of that is simplicity , or for whatever reason , it is certain that very few American writers or speakers wield their native language with the directness , precision , and force that are common as the day in the mother country . We use it like Scotsmen , not as if it belonged to us , but as if we wished to prove that we belonged to it , by showing our intimacy with its written rather than with its spoken dialect . And yet all the while our popular idiom is racy with life and vigor and originality , bucksome ( as Milton used the word ) to our new occasions , and proves itself no mere graft by sending up new suckers from the old root in spite of us . It is only from its roots in the living generations of men that a language can be reinforced with fresh vigor for its needs ; what may be called a literate dialect grows ever more and more pedantic and foreign , till it becomes at last as unfitting a vehicle for living thought as monkish Latin . That we should all be made to talk like books is the danger with which we are threatened by the Universal Schoolmaster , who does his best to enslave the minds and memories of his victims to what he esteems the best models of English composition , that is to say , to the writers whose style is faultily correct and has no blood-warmth in it . No language after it has faded into diction , none that cannot suck up the feeding juices secreted for it in the rich mother-earth of common folk , can bring forth a sound and lusty book . True vigor and heartiness of phrase do not pass from page to page , but from man to man , where the brain is kindled and the lips suppled by downright living interests and by passion in its very throe . Language is the soil of thought , and our own especially is a rich leaf-mould , the slow deposit of ages , the shed foliage of feeling , fancy , and imagination , which has suffered an earth-change , that the vocal forest , as Howell called it , may clothe itself anew with living green . There is death in the dictionary ; and , where language is too strictly limited by convention , the ground for expression to grow in is limited also ; and we get a potted literature , Chinese dwarfs instead of healthy trees . But while the schoolmaster has been busy starching our language and smoothing it flat with the mangle of a supposed classical authority , the newspaper reporter has been doing even more harm by stretching and swelling it to suit his occasions . A dozen years ago I began a list , which I have added to from time to time , of some of the changes which may be fairly laid at his door . I give a few of them as showing their tendency , all the more dangerous that their effect , like that of some poisons , is insensibly cumulative , and that they are sure at last of effect among a people whose chief reading is the daily paper . I give in two columns the old style and its modern equivalent . Old Style . New Style . Was hanged . Was launched into eternity . When the halter When the fatal was put round noose was adjusted his neck . about the neck of the unfortunate victim of his own unbridled passions . A great crowd A vast concourse came to see . was assembled to witness . Great fire . Disastrous conflagration . The fire spread . The conflagration extended its devastating career . House burned . Edifice consumed . The fire was got The progress of under . the devouring element was arrested . Man fell . Individual was precipitated .

Sent for the doctor . Called into requisition the services of the family physician . The mayor of the The chief magistrate city in a short of the metropolis , in well - speech welcomed . chosen and eloquent language , frequently interrupted by the plaudits of the surging multitude , officially tendered the hospitalities . I shall say a few I shall , with your words . permission , beg leave to offer some brief observations . Began his answer . Commenced his rejoinder . Asked him to dine . Tendered him a banquet . A bystander advised . One of those omnipresent characters who , as if in pursuance of some previous arrangement , are certain to be encountered in the vicinity when an accident occurs , ventured the suggestion . He died . He deceased , he passed out of existence , his spirit quitted its earthly habitation , winged its way to eternity , shook off its burden , etc . In one sense this is nothing new . The school of Pope in verse ended by wire-drawing its phrase to such thinness that it could bear no weight of meaning whatever . Nor is fine writing by any means confined to America . All writers without imagination fall into it of necessity whenever they attempt the figurative . I take two examples from Mr. Merivale 's ‘ History of the Romans under the Empire , ’ which , indeed , is full of such . ‘ The last years of the age familiarly styled the Augustan were singularly barren of the literary glories from which its celebrity was chiefly derived . One by one the stars in its firmament had been lost to the world ; Virgil and Horace , etc ., had long since died ; the charm which the imagination of Livy had thrown over the earlier annals of Rome had ceased to shine on the details of almost contemporary history ; and if the flood of his eloquence still continued flowing , we can hardly suppose that the stream was as rapid , as fresh , and as clear as ever . ’ I will not waste time in criticising the bad English or the mixture of metaphor in these sentences , but will simply cite another from the same author which is even worse . ‘ The shadowy phantom of the Republic continued to flit before the eyes of the Cæsar . There was still , he apprehended , a germ of sentiment existing , on which a scion of his own house , or even a stranger , might boldly throw himself and raise the standard of patrician independence . ’ Now a ghost may haunt a murderer , but hardly , I should think , to scare him with the threat of taking a new lease of its old tenement . And fancy the scion of a house in the act of throwing itself upon a germ of sentiment to raise a standard ! I am glad , since we have so much in the same kind to answer for , that this bit of horticultural rhetoric is from beyond sea . I would not be supposed to condemn truly imaginative prose . There is a simplicity of splendor , no less than of plainness , and prose would be poor indeed if it could not find a tongue for that meaning of the mind which is behind the meaning of the words . It has sometimes seemed to me that in England there was a growing tendency to curtail language into a mere convenience , and to defecate it of all emotion as thoroughly as algebraic signs . This has arisen , no doubt , in part from that healthy national contempt of humbug which is characteristic of Englishmen , in part from that sensitiveness to the ludicrous which makes them so shy of expressing feeling , but in part also , it is to be feared , from a growing distrust , one might almost say hatred , of whatever is super-material . There is something sad in the scorn with which their journalists treat the notion of there being such a thing as a national ideal , seeming utterly to have forgotten that even in the affairs of this world the imagination is as much matter-of-fact as the understanding . If we were to trust the impression made on us by some of the cleverest and most characteristic of their periodical literature , we should think England hopelessly stranded on the good-humored cynicism of well-to-do middle-age , and should fancy it an enchanted nation , doomed to sit forever with its feet under the mahogany in that after-dinner mood which follows conscientious repletion , and which it is ill-manners to disturb with any topics more exciting than the quality of the wines . But there are already symptoms that a large class of Englishmen are getting weary of the dominion of consols and divine common-sense , and to believe that eternal three per cent . is not the chief end of man , nor the highest and only kind of interest to which the powers and opportunities of England are entitled . The quality of exaggeration has often been remarked on as typical of American character , and especially o £ American humor . In Dr. Petri 's Gedrängtes Handbuch der Fremdwörter , we are told that the word humbug is commonly used for the exaggerations of the North-Americans . To be sure , one would be tempted to think the dream of Columbus half fulfilled , and that Europe had found in the West a nearer way to Orientalism , at least in diction . But it seems tome that a great deal of what is set down as mere extravagance is more fitly to be called intensity and picturesqueness , symptoms ol the imaginative faculty in full health and strength , though producing , as yet , only the raw and formless material in which poetry is to work . By and by , perhaps , the world will see it fashioned into poem and picture , and Europe , which will be hard pushed for originality erelong , may have to thank us for a new sensation . The French continue to find Shakespeare exaggerated because he treated English just as our country-folk do when they speak of a ‘ steep price , ’ or say that they ‘ freeze to ’ a thing . The first postulate of an original literature is that a people should use their language instinctively and unconsciously , as if it were a lively part of their growth and personality , not as the mere torpid boon of education or inheritance . Even Burns contrived to write very poor verse and prose in English . Vulgarisms are often only poetry in the egg . The late Mr. Horace Mann , in one of his public addresses , commented at some length on the beauty and moral significance ol the French phrase s'orienter and called on his young friends to practise upon it in life . There was not a Yankee in his audience whose problem had not always been to find out what was about east , and to shape his course accordingly . This charm which a familiar expression gains by being commented , as it were , and . set in a new light by a foreign language , is curious and instructive . I cannot help thinking that Mr. Matthew Arnold forgets this a little too much sometimes when he writes of the beauties of French style . It would not be hard to find in the works of French Academicians phrases as coarse as those he cites from Burke , only they are veiled by the unfamiliarity of the language . But , however this may be , it is certain that poets and peasants please us in the same way by translating words back again to their primal freshness , and infusing them with a delightful strangeness which is anything but alienation . What , for example , is Milton 's ‘ edge of battle ’ but a doing into English of the Latin acies ? Was die Gans gedacht das der Schwan vollbracht , what the goose but thought , that the swan full brought ( or , to de-Saxonize it a little , what the goose conceived , that the swan achieved ) , and it may well be that the life , invention , and vigor shown by our popular speech , and the freedom with which it is shaped to the instant want of those who use it , are of the best omen for our having a swan at last . The part I have taken on myself is that of the humbler bird . But it is affirmed that there is something innately vulgar in the Yankee dialect . M. Sainte-Beuve says , with his usual neatness : ‘ Je définis un patois une ancienne langue qui a eu des malheurs , ou encore une langue toute jeune st qui n'a pas fait fortune . ’ The first part of his definition applies to a dialect like the Provençal , the last to the Tuscan before Dante had lifted it into a classic , and neither , it seems to me , will quite fit a patois /, which is not properly a dialect , but rather certain archaisms , proverbial phrases , and modes of pronunciation , which maintain themselves among the uneducated side by side with the finished and universally accepted language . Norman French , for example , or Scotch down to the time of James VI ., could hardly be called patois , while I should be half inclined to name the Yankee a lingo rather than a dialect . It has retained a few words now fallen into disuse in the mother country , like to tarry , to progress , fleshy , fall , and some others ; it has changed the meaning of some , as in freshet ; and it has clung to what I suspect to have been the broad Norman pronunciation of e ( which Molière puts into the mouth of his rustics ) in such words as sarvant , parfect , vartoo , and the like . It maintains something of the French sound of a also in words like ch [) a ] mber , d [) a ] nger ( though the latter had certainly begun to take its present sound so early as 1636 , when I find it sometimes spelt dainger ) . But in general it may be said that nothing can be found in it which does not still survive in some one or other of the English provincial dialects . There is , perhaps , a single exception in the verb to sleeve . To sleeve silk means to divide or ravel out a thread of silk with the point of a needle till it becomes floss . ( A. S. sléfan , to cleave = divide . ) This , I think , explains the ‘ sleeveless errand ’ in ‘ Troilus and Cressida ’ so inadequately , sometimes so ludicrously darkened by the commentators . Is not a ‘ sleeveless errand ’ one that cannot be unravelled , incomprehensible , and therefore bootless ? I am not speaking now of Americanisms properly so called , that is , of words or phrases which have grown into use here either through necessity , invention , or accident , such as a carry , a one-horse affair , a prairie , to vamose . Even these are fewer than is sometimes taken for granted . But I think some fair defence may be made against the charge of vulgarity . Properly speaking , vulgarity is in the thought , and not in the word or the way of pronouncing it . Modern French , the most polite of languages , is barbarously vulgar if compared with the Latin out of which it has been corrupted , or even with Italian . There is a wider gap , and one implying greater boorishness , between ministerium and métier , or sapiens and sachant , than between druv and drove or agin and against , which last is plainly an arrant superlative . Our rustic coverlid is nearer its French original than the diminutive coverlet , into which it has been ignorantly corrupted in politer speech . I obtained from three cultivated Englishmen at different times three diverse pronunciations of a single word ,— cowcumber , coocumber , and cucumber . Of these the first , which is Yankee also , comes nearest to the nasality of concombre . Lord Ossory assures us that Voltaire saw the best society in England , and Voltaire tells his countrymen that handkerchief was pronounced hankercher . I find it so spelt in Hakluyt and elsewhere . This enormity the Yankee still persists in , and as there is always a reason for such deviations from the sound as represented by the spelling , may we not suspect two sources of derivation , and find an ancestor for kercher in couverture rather than in couvrechef ? And what greater phonetic vagary ( which Dryden , by the way , called fegary ) in our lingua rustica than this ker for couvre ? I copy from the fly-leaves of my books , where I have noted them from time to time , a few examples of pronunciation and phrase which will show that the Yankee often has antiquity and very respectable literary authority on his side . My list might be largely increased by referring to glossaries , but to them eyery one can go for himself , and I have gathered enough for my purpose . I will take first those cases in which something like the French sound has been preserved in certain single letters and diphthongs . And this opens a curious question as to how long this Gallicism maintained itself in England . Sometimes a divergence in pronunciation has given as two words with different meanings , as in genteel and jaunty , which I find coming in toward the close of the seventeenth century , and wavering between genteel and jantee . It is usual in America to drop the u in words ending in our — a very proper change recommended by Howell two centuries ago , and carried out by him so far as his printers would allow . This and the corresponding changes in musique , musick , and the like , which he also advocated , show that in his time the French accent indicated by the superfluous letters ( for French had once nearly as strong an accent as Italian ) had gone out of use . There is plenty of French accent down to the end of Elizabeth 's reign . In Daniel we have riches ’ and counsel ’ , in Bishop Hall comet ’ , chapëlain , in Donne pictures ’ , virtue ’ , presence ’ , mortal ’ , merit ’ , hainous ’ , giant ’ , with many more , and Marston 's satires are full of them . The two latter , however , are not to be relied on , as they may be suspected of Chaucerizing . Herrick writes baptime . The tendency to throw the accent backward began early . But the incongruities are perplexing , and perhaps mark the period of transition . In Warner 's ‘ Albion 's England ’ we have creator ’ and crëature ’ side by side with the modern creator and creature . E'nvy and e'nvying occur in Campion ( 1602 ) , and yet envy ’ survived Milton . In some cases we have gone back again nearer to the French , as in rev'enue for reven'ue , I had been so used to hearing imbecile pronounced with the accent on the first syllable , which is in accordance with the general tendency in such matters , that I was surprised to find imbec'ile in a verse of Wordsworth . The dictionaries all give it so . I asked a highly cultivated Englishman , and he declared for imbeceel ’ . In general it may be assumed that accent will finally settle on the syllable dictated by greater ease and therefore quickness of utterance . Blas ’ - phemous , for example , is more rapidly pronounced than blasphem'ous , to which our Yankee clings , following in this the usage of many of the older poets . Amer'ican is easier than Ameri'can , and therefore the false quantity has carried the day , though the true one may be found in George Herbert , and even so late as Cowley . To come back to the matter in hand . Our ‘ uplandish man ’ retains the soft or thin sound of the u in some words , such as rule , truth ( sometimes also pronounced tr [) u ] th , not trooth ) , while he says noo for new , and gives to view and few so indescribable a mixture of the two sounds with a slight nasal tincture that it may be called the Yankee shibboleth . Voltaire says that the English pronounce true as if it rhymed with view , and this is the sound our rustics give to it . Spenser writes deow ( dew ) which can only be pronounced with the Yankee nasality . In rule the least sound of a precedes the u. I find reule in Pecock 's ‘ Repressor . ’ He probably pronounced it rayoolë , as the old French word from which it is derived was very likely to be sounded at first , with a reminiscence of its original regula . Tindal has reuler , and the Coventry Plays have preudent . In the ‘ Parlyament of Byrdes ’ I find reule . As for noo , may it not claim some sanction in its derivation , whether from nouveau or neuf , the ancient sound of which may very well have been noof , as nearer novus ? Beef would seem more like to have come from buffe than from boeuf , unless the two were mere varieties of spelling . The Saxon few may have caught enough from its French cousin peu to claim the benefit of the same doubt as to sound ; and our slang phrase a few ( as ‘ I licked him a few ’ ) may well appeal to un peu for sense and authority . Nay , might not lick itself turn out to be the good old word lam in an English disguise , it the latter should claim descent as , perhaps , he fairly might , from the Latin lambere ? The New England ferce for fierce , and perce for pierce ( sometimes heard as fairce and pairce ) , are also Norman . For its antiquity I cite the rhyme of verse and pierce in Chapman and Donne , and in some commendatory verses by a Mr. Berkenhead before the poems of Francis Beaumont . Our pairlous for perilous is of the same kind , and is nearer Shakespeare 's parlous than the modern pronunciation . One other Gallicism survives in our pronunciation . Perhaps I should rather call it a semi-Gallicism , for it is the result of a futile effort to reproduce a French sound with English lips . Thus for joint , employ , royal , we have jynt , emply , r [) y ] le , the last differing only from rile ( roil ) in a prolongation of the y sound . I find royal so pronounced in the ‘ Mirror for Magistrates . ’ In Walter de Biblesworth I find solives Englished by gistes . This , it is true , may have been pronounced jeests , but the pronunciation jystes must have preceded the present spelling , which was no doubt adopted after the radical meaning was forgotten , as analogical with other words in oi . In the same way after Norman-French influence had softened the l out of would ( we already find woud for veut in N. F . poems ) , should followed the example , and then an l was foisted into could , where it does not belong , to satisfy the logic of the eye , which has affected the pronunciation and even the spelling of English more than is commonly supposed . I meet with eyster for oyster as early as the fourteenth century . I find viage in Bishop Hall and Middleton the dramatist , bile for boil in Donne and Chrononhotonthologos , line for loin in Hall , ryall and chyse ( for choice ) dystrye for destroy , in the Coventry Plays . In Chapman 's ‘ All Fools ’ is the misprint of employ for imply , fairly inferring an identity of sound in the last syllable . Indeed , this pronunciation was habitual till after Pope , and Rogers tells us that the elegant Gray said naise for noise just as our rustics still do . Our cornish ( which I find also in Herrick ) remembers the French better than cornice does . While clinging more closely to the Anglo-Saxon in dropping the g from the end of the present participle , the Yankee now and then pleases himself with an experiment in French nasality in words ending in n. It is not , so far as my experience goes , very common , though it may formerly have been more so . Capting , for instance , I never heard save in jest , the habitual form being kepp'n . But at any rate it is no invention of ours . In that delightful old volume , ‘ Ane Compendious Buke of Godly and Spirituall Songs , ’ in which I know not whether the piety itself or the simplicity of its expression be more charming , I find burding , garding , and cousing , and in the State Trials uncerting used by a gentleman . I confess that I like the n better than ng . Of Yankee preterites I find risse and rize for rose in Beaumont and Fletcher , Middleton and Dryden , clim in Spenser , chees ( chose ) in Sir John Mandevil , give ( gave ) in the Coventry Plays , shet ( shut ) in Golding 's Ovid , het in Chapman and in Weever 's Epitaphs , thriv and smit in Drayton , quit in Ben Jonson and Henry More , and pled in the Paston Letters , nay , even in the fastidious Landor . Rid for rode was anciently common . So likewise was see for saw , but I find it in no writer of authority ( except Golding ) , unless Chaucer 's seie and Gower 's sigh were , as I am inclined to think , so sounded . Shew is used by Hector Boece , Giles Fletcher , Drummond of Hawthornden , and in the Paston Letters . Similar strong preterites , like snew , thew , and even mew , are not without example . I find sew for sewed in ‘ Piers Ploughman . ’ Indeed , the anomalies in English preterites are perplexing . We have probably transferred flew from flow ( as the preterite of which I have heard it ) to fly because we had another preterite in fled . Of weak preterites the Yankee retains growed , blowed , for which he has good authority , and less often knowed . His sot is merely a broad sounding of sat , no more inelegant than the common got for gat , which he further degrades into gut . When he says darst , he uses a form as old as Chaucer . The Yankee has retained something of the long sound of the a in such words as axe , wax , pronouncing them exe , wex ( shortened from aix , waix ) . He also says hev and hed ( h [= a ] ve , h [= a ] d for have and had ) . In most cases he follows an Anglo-Saxon usage . In aix for axle he certainly does . I find wex and aisches ( ashes ) in Pecock , and exe in the Paston Letters . Golding rhymes wax with wexe and spells challenge chelenge . Chaucer wrote hendy . Dryden rhymes can with men , as Mr. Biglow would . Alexander Gill , Milton 's teacher , in his ‘ Logonomia ’ cites hez for hath as peculiar to Lincolnshire . I find hayth in Collier 's ‘ Bibliographical Account of Early English Literature ’ under the date 1584 , and Lord Cromwell so wrote it . Sir Christopher Wren wrote belcony . Our fect is only the O. F . faict . Thaim for them was common in the sixteenth century . We have an example of the same thing in the double form of the verb thrash , thresh . While the New Englander cannot be brought to say instead for instid ( commonly ‘ stid where not the last word in a sentence ) , he changes the i into e in red for rid , tell for till , hender for hinder , rense for rinse . I find red in the old interlude of ‘ Thersytes , ’ tell in a letter of Daborne to Henslowe , and also , I shudder to mention it , in a letter of the great Duchess of Marlborough , Atossa herself ! It occurs twice in a single verse of the Chester Plays , ‘ Tell the day of dome , tell the beames blow . ’ From the word blow ( in another sense ) is formed blowth , which I heard again this summer after a long interval . Mr. Wright<span type="note_anchor">[ 24 ]</span>explains it as meaning ‘ a blossom . ’ With us a single blossom is a blow , while blowth means the blossoming in general . A farmer would say that there was a good blowth on his fruit-trees . The word retreats farther inland and away from the railways , year by year . Wither rhymes hinder with slender , and Shakespeare and Lovelace have renched for rinsed . In ‘ Gammer Gurton ’ and ‘ Mirror for Magistrates ’ is sence for since ; Marlborough 's Duchess so writes it , and Donne rhymes since with Amiens and patïence , Bishop Hall and Otway with pretence , Chapman with citizens , Dryden with providence . Indeed , why should not sithence take that form ? Dryden 's wife ( an earl 's daughter ) has tell for till , Margaret , mother of Henry VII ., writes seche for such , and our ef finds authority in the old form yeffe . E sometimes takes the place of u , as jedge , tredge , bresh . I find tredge in the interlude of ‘ Jack Jugler , ’ bresh in a citation by Collier from ‘ London Cries ’ of the middle of the seventeenth century , and resche for rush ( fifteenth century ) in the very valuable ‘ Volume of Vocabularies ’ edited by Mr. Wright . Resce is one of the Anglo-Saxon forms of the word in Bosworth 's A. - S . Dictionary . Golding has shet . The Yankee always shortens the u in the ending ture , making ventur , natur , pictur , and so on . This was common , also , among the educated of the last generation . I am inclined to think it may have been once universal , and I certainly think it more elegant than the vile vencher , naycher , pickcher , that have taken its place , sounding like the invention of a lexicographer to mitigate a sneeze . Nash in his ‘ Pierce Penniless ’ has ventur , and so spells it , and I meet it also in Spenser , Drayton , Ben Jonson , Herrick , and Prior . Spenser has tort'rest , which can be contracted only from tortur and not from torcher . Quarles rhymes nature with creator , and Dryden with satire , which he doubtless pronounced according to its older form of satyr . Quarles has also torture and mortar . Mary Boleyn writes kreatur . I find pikter in Izaak Walton 's autograph will . I shall now give some examples which cannot so easily be ranked under any special head . Gill charges the Eastern counties with kiver for cover , and ta , for to . The Yankee pronounces both too and to like ta ( like the tou in touch ) where they are not emphatic . When they are , both become tu . In old spelling , to is the common ( and indeed correct ) form of too , which is only to with the sense of in addition . I suspect that the sound of our too has caught something from the French tout , and it is possible that the old too too is not a reduplication , but a reminiscence of the feminine form of the same word ( toute ) as anciently pronounced , with the e not yet silenced . Gill gives a Northern origin to geaun for gown and waund for wound ( vulnus ) . Lovelace has waund , but there is something too dreadful in suspecting Spenser ( who borealised in his pastorals ) of having ever been guilty of geaun ! And yet some delicate mouths even now are careful to observe the Hibernicism of ge-ard for guard , and ge-url for girl . Sir Philip Sidney ( credite posteri ! ) wrote furr for far . I would hardly have believed it had I not seen it in facsimile . As some consolation , I find furder in Lord Bacon and Donne , and Wittier rhymes far with cur . The Yankee , who omits the final d in many words , as do the Scotch , makes up for it by adding one in geound . The purist does not feel the loss of the d sensibly in lawn and yon , from the former of which it has dropped again after a wrongful adoption ( retained in laundry ) , while it properly belongs to the latter . But what shall we make of git , yit , and yis ? I find yis and git in Warner 's ‘ Albion 's England , ’ yet rhyming with wit , admit , and fit in Donne , with wit in the ‘ Revenger 's Tragedy , ’ Beaumont , and Suckling , with writ in Dryden , and latest of all with wit in Sir Hanbury Williams . Prior rhymes fitting and begetting . Worse is to come . Among others , Donne rhymes again with sin , and Quarles repeatedly with in . Ben for been , of which our dear Whittier is so fond , has the authority of Sackville , ‘ Gammer Gurton ’ ( the work of a bishop ) , Chapman , Dryden , and many more , though bin seems to have been the common form . Whittier 's accenting the first syllable of rom'ance finds an accomplice in Drayton among others , and , though manifestly wrong , is analogous with Rom'ans . Of other Yankeeisms , whether of form or pronunciation , which I have met with I add a few at random . Pecock writes sowdiers ( sogers , soudoyers ) , and Chapman and Gill sodder . This absorption of the l is common in various dialects , especially in the Scottish . Pecock writes also biyende , and the authors of ‘ Jack Jugler ’ and ‘ Gammer Gurton ’ yender . The Yankee includes ‘ yon ’ in the same catagory , and says ‘ hither an ’ yen , ’ for ‘ to and fro . ’ ( Cf . German jenseits . ) Pecock and plenty more have wrastle . Tindal has agynste , gretter , shett , ondone , debyte , and scace . ‘ Jack Jugler ’ has scacely ( which I have often heard , though skurce is the common form ) , and Donne and Dryden make great rhyme with set . In the inscription on Caxton 's tomb I find ynd for end , which the Yankee more often makes eend , still using familiarly the old phrase ‘ right anend ’ for ‘ continuously . ’ His ‘ stret ( straight ) along ’ in the same sense , which I thought peculiar to him , I find in Pecock . Tindal 's debytë for deputy is so perfectly Yankee that I could almost fancy the brave martyr to have been deacon of the First Parish at Jaalam Centre . ‘ Jack Jugler ’ further gives us playsent and sartayne . Dryden rhymes certain with parting , and Chapman and Ben Jonson use certain , as the Yankee always does , for certainly . The ‘ Coventry Mysteries ’ have occapied , massage , nateralle , materal ( material ) , and meracles ,— all excellent Yankeeisms . In the ‘ Quatre fils , Aymon ’ ( 1504 ) ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 25 ]</span>is vertus for virtuous . Thomas Fuller called volume vollum , I suspect , for he spells it volumne . However , per contra , Yankees habitually say colume for column . Indeed , to prove that our ancestors brought their pronunciation with them from the Old Country , and have not wantonly debased their mother tongue , I need only to cite the words scriptur , Israll , athists , and cherfulness from Governor Bradford 's ‘ History . ’ So the good man wrote them , and so the good descendants of his fellow-exiles still pronounce them . Brampton Gurdon writes shet in a letter to Winthrop . Purtend ( pretend ) has crept like a serpent into the ‘ Paradise Of Dainty Devices ; ’ purvide , which is not so bad , is in Chaucer . These , of course , are universal vulgarisms , and not peculiar to the Yankee . Butler has a Yankee phrase , and pronunciation too , in ‘ To which these carr'ingshYpppHeNon did tend . ’ Langham or Laneham , who wrote an account of the festivities at Kenilworth in honor of Queen Bess , and who evidently tried to spell phonetically , makes sorrows into sororz . Herrick writes hollow for halloo , and perhaps pronounced it ( horresco suggerens ! ) holló , as Yankees do . Why not , when it comes from holà ? I find ffelaschyppe ( fellowship ) in the Coventry Plays . Spenser and his queen neither of them scrupled to write afore , and the former feels no inelegance even in chaw and idee . ‘ Fore was common till after Herrick . Dryden has do 's for does , and his wife spells worse wosce . Afeared was once universal . Warner has ery for ever a ; nay , he also has illy , with which we were once ignorantly reproached by persons more familiar with Murray 's Grammar than with English literature . And why not illy ? Mr. Bartlett says it is ‘ a word used by writers of an inferior class , who do not seem to perceive that ill is itself an adverb , without the termination ly , ’ and quotes Dr. Mosser , President of Brown University , as asking triumphantly , ‘ Why do n't you say ‘ welly ? ’ I should like to have had Dr. Messer answer his own question . It would be truer to say that it was used by people who still remembered that ill was an adjective , the shortened form of evil , out of which Shakespeare and the translators of the Bible ventured to make evilly . This slurred evil is ‘ the dram of eale ’ in ‘ Hamlet . ’ I find , illy in Warner . The objection to illy is not an etymological one , but simply that it is contrary to good usage ,— a very sufficient reason . Ill as an adverb was at first a vulgarism , precisely like the rustic 's when he says , ‘ I was treated bad . ’ May not the reason of this exceptional form be looked for in that tendency to dodge what is hard to pronounce , to which I have already alluded ? If the letters were distinctly uttered , as they should be , it would take too much time to say ill-ly , well-ly , and it is to be observed that we have avoided smally<span type="note_anchor">[ 26 ]</span>and tally in the same way , though we add ish to them without hesitation in smallish and tallish . We have , to be sure , dully and fully , but for the one we prefer stupidly , and the other ( though this may have come from eliding the y before as ) is giving way to full . The uneducated , whose utterance is slower , still make adverbs when they will by adding like to all manner of adjectives . We have had big charged upon us , because we use it where an Englishman would now use great . I fully admit that it were better to distinguish between them , allowing to big a certain contemptuous quality ; but as for authority , I want none better than that of Jeremy Taylor , who , in his noble sermon ‘ On the Return of Prayer , ’ speaks of ‘ Jesus , whose spirit was meek and gentle up to the greatness of the biggest example . ’ As for our double negative , I shall waste no time in quoting instances of it , because it was once as universal in English as it still is in the neo-Latin languages , where it does not strike us as vulgar . I am not sure that the loss of it is not to be regretted . But surely I shall admit the vulgarity of slurring or altogether eliding certain terminal consonants ? I admit that a clear and sharp-cut enunciation is one of the crowning charms and elegances of speech . Words so uttered are like coins fresh from the mint , compared with the worn and dingy drudges of long service ,— I do not mean American coins , for those look less badly the more they lose of their original ugliness . No one is more painfully conscious than I of the contrast between the rifle-crack of an Englishman 's yes and no , and the wet-fuse drawl of the same monosyllables in the mouths of my countrymen . But I do not find the dropping of final consonants disagreeable in Allan Ramsay or Burns , nor do I believe that our literary ancestors were sensible of that inelegance in the fusing them together of which we are conscious . How many educated men pronounce the t in chestnut ? how many say pentise for penthouse , as they should . When a Yankee skipper says that he is “ boun ’ for Gloster ” ( not Gloucester , with the leave of the Universal Schoolmaster ) ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 27 ]</span>he but speaks like Chaucer or an old ballad-singer , though they would have pronounced it boon . This is one of the cases where the d is surreptitious , and has been added in compliment to the verb bind , with which it has nothing to do . If we consider the root of the word ( though of course I grant that every race has a right to do what it will with what is so peculiarly its own as its speech ) , the d has no more right there than at the end of gone , where it is often put by children , who are our best guides to the sources of linguistic corruption , and the best teachers of its processes . Cromwell , minister of Henry VIII ., writes worle for world . Chapman has wan for wand , and lawn has rightfully displaced laund , though with no thought , I suspect , of etymology . Rogers tells us that Lady Bathurst sent him some letters written to William III . by Queen Mary , in which she addresses him as ‘ Dear Husban . ’ The old form expoun ’ , which our farmers use , is more correct than the form with a barbarous d tacked on which has taken its place . Of the kind opposite to this , like our gownd for gown , and the London cockney 's wind for wine , I find drownd for drown in the ‘ Misfortunes of Arthur ’ ( 1584 ) and in Swift . And , by the way , whence came the long sound of wind which our poets still retain , and which survives in ‘ winding ’ a horn , a totally different word from ‘ winding ’ a kite-string ? We say beh [= i ] nd and h [= i ] nder ( comparative ) and yet to h [) i ] nder . Shakespeare pronounced kind k [) i ] nd , or what becomes of his play on that word and kin in ‘ Hamlet ’ ? Nay , did he not even ( shall I dare to hint it ? ) drop the final d as the Yankee still does ? John Lilly plays in the same way on kindred and kindness . But to come to some other ancient instances . Warner rhymes bounds with crowns , grounds with towns , text with sex , worst with crust , interrupts with cups ; Drayton , defects with sex ; Chapman , amends with cleanse ; Webster , defects with checks ; Ben Jonson , minds with combines ; Marston , trust and obsequious , clothes and shows ; Dryden gives the same sound to clothes , and has also minds with designs . Of course , I do not affirm that their ears may not have told them that these were imperfect rhymes ( though I am by no means sure even of that ) , but they surely would never have tolerated any such had they suspected the least vulgarity in them . Prior has the rhyme first and trust , but puts it into the mouth of a landlady . Swift has stunted and burnt it , an intentionally imperfect rhyme , no doubt , but which I cite as giving precisely the Yankee pronunciation of burned . Donne couples in unhallowed wedlock after and matter , thus seeming to give to both the true Yankee sound ; and it is not uncommon to find after and daughter . Worse than all , in one of Dodsley 's Old Plays we have onions rhyming with minions ,— I have tears in my eyes while I record it . And yet what is viler than the universal Misses ( Mrs .) for Mistress ? This was once a vulgarism , and in ‘ The Miseries of Inforced Marriage ’ the rhyme ( printed as prose in Dodsley 's Old Plays by Collier ) , ‘ To make my young mistress Delighting in kisses , ’ is put into the mouth of the clown . Our people say Injun for Indian . The tendency to make this change where i follows d is common . The Italian giorno and French jour from diurnus are familiar examples . And yet Injun is one of those depravations which the taste challenges peremptorily , though it have the authority of Charles Cotton — who rhymes ‘ Indies ’ with ‘ cringes ’ — and four English lexicographers , beginning with Dr. Sheridan , bid us say invidgeous . Yet after all it is no worse than the debasement which all our terminations in tion and tience have undergone , which yet we hear with resignashun and payshunce , though it might have aroused both impat-i-ence and in-dig-na-ti-on in Shakespeare 's time . When George Herbert tells us that if the sermon be dull , ‘ God takes a text and preacheth patience , ’ the prolongation of the word seems to convey some hint at the longanimity of the virtue . Consider what a poor curtal we have made of Ocean . There was something of his heave and expanse in o-ce-an , and Fletcher knew how to use it when he wrote so fine a verse as the second of these , the best deep-sea verse I know ,— ‘ In desperate storms stem with a little rudder The tumbling ruins of the oceän . ’ Oceanus was not then wholly shorn of his divine proportions , and our modern oshun sounds like the gush of small-beer in comparison . Some other contractions of ours have a vulgar air about them . More ‘ n for more than , as one of the worst , may stand for a type of such . Yet our old dramatists are full of such obscurations ( elisions they can hardly be called ) of the th , making whe'r of whether , where of whither , here of hither , bro'r of brother , smo'r of smother , mo'r of mother , and so on . And dear Brer Rabbit , can I forget him ? Indeed , it is this that explains the word rare ( which has Dryden 's support ) , and which we say of meat where an Englishman would use underdone . I do not believe , with the dictionaries , that it had ever anything to do with the Icelandic hrar ( raw ) , as it plainly has not in rareripe , which means earlier ripe ,— President Lincoln said of a precocious boy that ‘ he was a rareripe . ’ And I do not believe it , for this reason , that the earliest form of the word with us was , and the commoner now in the inland parts still is , so far as I can discover , raredone . Golding has ‘ egs reere-rosted , ’ which , whatever else it mean , cannot mean raw-roasted , I find rather as a monosyllable in Donne , and still better , as giving the sound , rhyming with fair in Warner . There is an epigram of Sir Thomas Browne in which the words rather than make a monosyllable ;— ‘ What furie is't to take Death 's part And rather than by Nature , die by Art ! ’ The contraction more'n I find in the old play ‘ Fuimus Troes , ’ in a verse where the measure is so strongly accented as to leave it beyond doubt ,— ‘ A golden crown whose heirs More than half the world subdue . ’ It may be , however , that the contraction is in ‘ th'orld . ’ It is unmistakable in the ‘ Second Maiden 's Tragedy : ’ — ‘ It were but folly , Dear soul , to boast of more than I can perform . ’ Is our gin for given more violent than mar'l for marvel , which was once common , and which I find as late as Herrick ? Nay , Herrick has gin ( spelling it gen ) , too , as do the Scotch , who agree with us likewise in preferring chimly to chimney . I will now leave pronunciation and turn to words or phrases which have been supposed peculiar to us , only pausing to pick up a single dropped stitch , in the pronunciation of the word súpreme , which I had thought native till I found it in the well-languaged Daniel . I will begin with a word of which I have never met with any example in any English writer of authority . We express the first stage of withering in a green plant suddenly cut down by the verb to wilt . It is , of course , own cousin of the German welken , but I have never come upon it in literary use , and my own books of reference give me faint help . Graff gives welhèn , marcescere , and refers to weih ( weak ) , and conjecturally to A. - S , hvelan . The A. - S. wealwian ( to wither ) is nearer , but not so near as two words in the Icelandic , which perhaps put us on the track of its ancestry ,— velgi , tepefacere , ( and velki , with the derivative ) meaning contaminare . Wilt , at any rate , is a good word , filling , as it does , a sensible gap between drooping and withering , and the imaginative phrase ‘ he wilted right down , ’ like ‘ he caved right in , ’ is a true Americanism . Wilt occurs in English provincial glossaries , but is explained by wither , which with us it does not mean . We have a few words such as cache , cohog , carry ( portage ) , shoot ( chute ) , timber ( forest ) , bushwhack ( to pull a boat along by the bushes on the edge of a stream ) , buckeye ( a picturesque word for the horse-chestnut ) ; but how many can we be said to have fairly brought into the language , as Alexander Gill , who first mentions Americanisms , meant it when he said , ‘ Sed et ab Americanis nonnulla mutuamur ut MAIZ et CANOA ’ ? Very few , I suspect , and those mostly by borrowing from the French , German , Spanish , or Indian .<span type="note_anchor">[ 28 ]</span>‘ The Dipper , ’ for the ‘ Great Bear , ’ strikes me as having a native air . Bogus , in the sense of worthless , is undoubtedly ours , but is , I more than suspect , a corruption of the French bagasse ( from low Latin bagasea ) , which travelled up the Mississippi from New Orleans , where it was used for the refuse of the sugar-cane . It is true , we have modified the meaning of some words . We use freshet in the sense of flood , for which I have not chanced upon any authority . Our New England cross between Ancient Pistol and Dugald Dalgetty , Captain Underhill , uses the word ( 1638 ) to mean a current , and I do not recollect it elsewhere in that sense . I therefore leave it with a ? for future explorers . Crick for creek I find in Captain John Smith and in the dedication of Fuller 's ‘ Holy Warre , ’ and run , meaning a small stream , in Waymouth 's ‘ Voyage ’ ( 1605 ) . Humans for men , which Mr. Bartlett includes in his ‘ Dictionary of Americanisms , ’ is Chapman 's habitual phrase in his translation of Homer . I find it also in the old play of ‘ The Hog hath lost his Pearl . ’ Dogs for andirons is still current in New England , and in Walter de Biblesworth I find chiens glossed in the margin by andirons . Gunning for shooting is in Drayton . We once got credit for the poetical word fall for autumn , but Mr. Bartlett and the last edition of Webster 's Dictionary refer us to Dryden . It is even older , for I find it in Drayton , and Bishop Hall has autumn fall . Middleton plays upon the word : ‘ May'st thou have a reasonable good spring , for thou art like to have many dangerous foul falls . ’ Daniel does the same , and Coleridge uses it as we do . Gray uses the archaism picked for peaked , and the word smudge ( as our backwoodsmen do ) for a smothered fire . Lord Herbert of Cherbury ( more properly perhaps than even Sidney , the last preux chevalier ) has ‘ the Emperor 's folks ’ just as a Yankee would say it . Loan for lend , with which we have hitherto been blackened , I must retort upon the mother island , for it appears so long ago as in ‘ Albion 's England . ’ Fleshy , in the sense of stout , may claim Ben Jonson 's warrant , and I find it also so lately as in Francklin 's ‘ Lucian . ’ Chore is also Jonson 's word , and I am inclined to prefer it to chare and char , because I think that I see a more natural origin for it in the French jour — whence it might come to mean a day 's work , and thence a job — than anywhere else .<span type="note_anchor">[ 29 ]</span>At onst for at once I thought a corruption of our own , till I found it in the Chester Plays . I am now inclined to suspect it no corruption at all , but only an erratic and obsolete superlative at onest . To progress was flung in our teeth till Mr. Pickering retorted with Shakespeare 's ‘ doth prógress down thy cheeks . ’ I confess that I was never satisfied with this answer , because the accent was different , and because the word might here be reckoned a substantive quite as well as a verb . Mr. Bartlett ( in his dictionary above cited ) adds a surrebutter in a verse from Ford 's ‘ Broken Heart . ’ Here the word is clearly a verb , but with the accent unhappily still on the first syllable . Mr. Bartlett says that he ‘ cannot say whether the word was used in Bacon 's time or not . ’ It certainly was , and with the accent we give to it . Ben Jonson , in the ‘ Alchemist , ’ had this verse , ‘ Progress so from extreme unto extreme , ’ and Sir Philip Sidney , ‘ Progressing then from fair Turias ’ golden place . ’ Surely we may now sleep in peace , and our English cousins will forgive us , since we have cleared ourselves from any suspicion of originality in the matter ! Even after I had convinced myself that the chances were desperately against our having invented any of the Americanisms with which we are faulted and which we are in the habit of voicing , there were one or two which had so prevailingly indigenous an accent as to stagger me a little . One of these was ‘ the biggest thing out . ’ Alas , even this slender comfort is denied me . Old Gower has ‘ So harde an herte was none oute , ’ and ‘ That such merveile was none oute . ’ He also , by the way , says ‘ a sighte of flowres ’ as naturally as our up-country folk would say it . Poor for lean , thirds for dower , and dry for thirsty I find in Middleton 's plays . Dry is also in Skelton and in the ‘ World ’ ( 1754 ) . In a note on Middleton , Mr. Dyce thinks it needful to explain the phrase I can n't tell ( universal in America ) by the gloss I could not say . Middleton also uses sneeked , which I had believed an Americanism till I saw it there . It is , of course , only another form of snatch , analogous to theek and thatch ( cf . the proper names Dekker and Thacher ) , break ( brack ) and breach , make ( still common with us ) and match . ‘ Long on for occasioned by ( ‘ who is this ‘ long on ? ’ ) occurs constantly in Gower and likewise in Middleton . ‘ Cause why is in Chaucer . Raising ( an English version of the French leaven ) for yeast is employed by Gayton in his ‘ Festivous Notes on Don Quixote . ’ I have never seen an instance of our New England word emptins in the same sense , nor can I divine its original . Gayton has limekill ; also shuts for shutters , and the latter is used by Mrs. Hutchinson in her ‘ Life of Colonel Hutchinson . ’ Bishop Hall , and Purchas in his ‘ Pilgrims , ’ have chist for chest , and it is certainly nearer cista , as well as to its form in the Teutonic languages , whence probably we got it . We retain the old sound from cist , but chest is as old as Chaucer . Lovelace says wropt for wrapt . ‘ Musicianer ’ I had always associated with the militia-musters of my boyhood , and too hastily concluded it an abomination of our own , but Mr. Wright calls it a Norfolk word , and I find it to be as old as 1642 by an extract in Collier . ‘ Not worth the time of day , ’ had passed with me for native till I saw it in Shakespeare 's ‘ Pericles . ’ For slick ( which is only a shorter sound of sleek , like crick and the now universal britches for breeches ) I will only call Chapman and Jonson . ‘ That 's a sure card ! ’ and ‘ That 's a stinger ! ’ both sound like modern slang , but you will find the one in the old interlude of ‘ Thersytes ’ ( 1537 ) , and the other in Middleton . ‘ Right here , ’ a favorite phrase with our orators and with a certain class of our editors , turns up passim in the Chester and Coventry plays . Mr. Dickens found something very ludicrous in what he considered our neologism right away . But I find a phrase very like it , and which I would gladly suspect to be a misprint for it , in ‘ Gammer Gurton : ’ — ‘ Lyght it and bring it tite away . ’ But tite is the true word in this case . After all , what is it but another form of straightway ? Cussedness , meaning wickedness , malignity , and cuss , a sneaking , ill-natured fellow , in such phrases as ‘ He done it out o ’ pure cussedness , ’ and ‘ He is a nateral cuss , ’ have been commonly thought Yankeeisms . To vent certain contemptuously indignant moods they are admirable in their rough-and-ready way . But neither is our own . Cursydnesse , in the same sense of malignant wickedness , occurs in the Coventry Plays , and cuss may perhaps claim to have come in with the Conqueror . At least the term is also French . Saint Simon uses it and confesses its usefulness . Speaking of the Abbé Dubois , he says , ‘ Qui étoit en plein ce qu'un mauvais françois appelle un sacre , mais qui ne se peut guere exprimer autrement . ’ ‘ Not worth a cuss , ’ though supported by ‘ not worth a damn , ’ may be a mere corruption , since ‘ not worth a cress ’ is in ‘ Piers Ploughman . ’ ‘ I do n't see it , ’ was the popular slang a year or two ago , and seemed to spring from the soil ; but no , it is in Cibber 's ‘ Careless Husband . ’ Green sauce for vegetables I meet in Beaumont and Fletcher , Gayton , and elsewhere . Our rustic pronunciation sahce ( for either the diphthong au was anciently pronounced ah , or else we have followed abundant analogy in changing it to the latter sound , as we have in chance , dance , and so many more ) may be the older one , and at least gives some hint at its ancestor salsa . Warn , in the sense of notify , is , I believe , now peculiar to us , but Pecock so employs it . I find primmer ( primer , as we pronounce it ) in Beaumont and Fletcher , and a ‘ square eater ’ too ( compare our ‘ square meal ’ ) , heft for weight , and ‘ muchness ’ in the ‘ Mirror for Magistrates , ’ bankbill in Swift and Fielding , and as for that I might say passim . To cotton to is , I rather think , an Americanism . The nearest approach to it I have found is cotton together , in Congreve 's ‘ Love for Love . ’ To cotton or cotten , in another sense , is old and common . Our word means to cling , and its origin , possibly , is to be sought in another direction , perhaps in A. S. cvead , which means mud , clay ( both proverbially clinging ) , or better yet , in the Icelandic qvoda ( otherwise kód ) , meaning resin and glue , which are [ Greek : kat ’ exochaen ] , sticky substances . To spit cotton is , I think , American , and also , perhaps , to flax for to beat . To the halves still survives among us , though apparently obsolete in England . It means either to let or to hire a piece of land , receiving half the profit in money or in kind ( partibus locare ) . I mention it because in a note by some English editor , to which I have lost my reference , I have seen it wrongly explained . The editors of Nares cite Burton . To put , in the sense of to go , as Put ! for Begone ! would seem our own , and yet it is strictly analogous to the French se mettre à la voie , and the Italian mettersi in via . Indeed , Dante has a verse , ‘ Io sarei [ for mi sarei ] già messo per lo sentiero , ’ which , but for the indignity , might be translated , ‘ I should , ere this , have put along the way , ’ I deprecate in advance any share in General Banks 's notions of international law , but we may all take a just pride in his exuberant eloquence as something distinctively American . When he spoke a few years ago of ‘ letting the Union slide , ’ even those who , for political purposes , reproached him with the sentiment , admired the indigenous virtue of his phrase . Yet I find ‘ let the world slide ’ in Heywood 's Edward IV . ; ’ and in Beaumont and Fletcher 's ‘ Wit without Money , ’ Valentine says , ‘ Will you go drink , And let the world slide ? ’ So also in Sidney 's ‘ Arcadia , ’ ‘ Let his dominion slide . ’ In the one case it is put into the mouth of a clown , in the other , of a gentleman , and was evidently proverbial . It has even higher sanction , for Chaucer writes , ‘ Well nigh all other curës let he slide . ’ Mr. Bartlett gives ‘ above one 's bend ’ as an Americanism ; but compare Hamlet 's ‘ to the top of my bent . ’ In his tracks for immediately has acquired an American accent , and passes where he can for a native , but is an importation nevertheless ; for what is he but the Latin e vestigio , or at best the Norman French eneslespas , both which have the same meaning ? Hotfoot ( provincial also in England ) , I find in the old romance of ‘ Tristan , ’ ‘ Si s'en parti CHAUT PAS ’ Like for as is never used in New England , but is universal in the South and West . It has on its side the authority of two kings ( ego sum rex Romanorum et supra grammaticam ) , Henry VIII . and Charles I . This were ample , without throwing into the scale the scholar and poet Daniel . Them was used as a nominative by the majesty of Edward VI ., by Sir P. Hoby , and by Lord Paget ( in Froude 's ‘ History ’ ) . I have never seen any passage adduced where guess was used as the Yankee uses it . The word was familiar in the mouths of our ancestors , but with a different shade of meaning from that we have given it , which is something like rather think , though the Yankee implies a confident certainty by it when he says , ‘ I guess I du ! ’ There are two examples in Otway , one of which ( ‘ So in the struggle , I guess the note was lost ’ ) perhaps might serve our purpose , and Coleridge 's ‘ I guess ‘ twas fearful there to see ’ certainly comes very near . But I have a higher authority than either in Selden , who , in one of his notes to the ‘ Polyolbion , ’ writes , ‘ The first inventor of them ( I guess you dislike not the addition ) was one Berthold Swartz . ’ Here he must mean by it , ‘ I take it for granted . ’ Robert Greene , in his ‘ Quip for an Upstart Courtier , ’ makes Cloth-breeches say , ‘ but I gesse your maistership never tried what true honor meant . ’ In this case the word seems to be used with a meaning precisely like that which we give it . Another peculiarity almost as prominent is the beginning sentences , especially in answer to questions , with ‘ well . ’ Put before such a phrase as ‘ How d'e do ? ’ it is commonly short , and has the sound of it wul , but in reply it is deliberative , and the various shades of meaning which can be conveyed by difference of intonation , and by prolonging or abbreviating , I should vainly attempt to describe . I have heard ooa-ahl , wahl , ahl , wal and something nearly approaching the sound of the le in able . Sometimes before ‘ I ’ it dwindles to a mere l , as ‘'l I dunno . ’ A friend of mine ( why should I not please myself , though I displease him , by brightening my page with the initials of the most exquisite of humorists , J. H .? ) told me that he once heard five ‘ wells , ’ like pioneers , precede the answer to an inquiry about the price of land . The first was the ordinary wul , in deference to custom ; the second , the long , perpending ooahl , with a falling inflection of the voice ; the third , the same , but with the voice rising , as if in despair of a conclusion , into a plaintively nasal whine ; the fourth , wulh , ending in the aspirate of a sigh ; and then , fifth , came a short , sharp wal , showing that a conclusion had been reached . I have used this latter form in the ‘ Biglow Papers , ’ because , if enough nasality be added , it represents most nearly the average sound of what I may call the interjection . A locution prevails in the Southern and Middle States which is so curious that , though never heard in New England , I will give a few lines to its discussion , the more readily because it is extinct elsewhere . I mean the use of allow in the sense of affirm , as ‘ I allow that 's a good horse . ’ I find the word so used in 1558 by Anthony Jenkinson in Hakluyt : ‘ Corne they sowe not , neither doe eate any bread , mocking the Christians for the same , and disabling our strengthe , saying we live by eating the toppe of a weede , and drinke a drinke made of the same , allowing theyr great devouring of flesh and drinking of milke to be the increase of theyr strength . ’ That is , they undervalued our strength , and affirmed their own to be the result of a certain diet . In another passage of the same narrative the word has its more common meaning of approving or praising : ‘ The said king , much allowing this declaration , said . ’ Ducange quotes Bracton sub voce ADLOCARE for the meaning ‘ to admit as proved , ’ and the transition from this to ‘ affirm , ’ is by no means violent . Izaak Walton has ‘ Lebault allows waterfrogs to be good meat , ’ and here the word is equivalent to affirms . At the same time , when we consider some of the meanings of allow in old English , and of allouer in old French , and also remember that the verbs prize and praise are from one root , I think we must admit allaudare to a share in the paternity of allow . The sentence from Hakluyt would read equally well , ‘ contemning our strengthe , ... and praising ( or valuing ) their great eating of flesh as the cause of their increase in strength . ’ After all , if we confine ourselves to allocare , it may turn out that the word was somewhere and somewhen used for to bet , analogously to put up , put down , post ( cf . Spanish apostar ) , and the like . I hear boys in the street continually saying , ‘ I bet that 's a good horse , ’ or what not , meaning by no means to risk anything beyond their opinion in the matter . The word improve , in the sense of to ‘ occupy , make use of , employ , ’ as Dr. Pickering defines it , he long ago proved to be no neologism . He would have done better , I think , had he substituted profit by for employ . He cites Dr. Franklin as saying that the word had never , so far as he knew , been used in New England before he left it in 1723 , except in Dr. Mather 's ‘ Bemarkable Providences , ’ which he oddly calls a ‘ very old book . ’ Franklin , as Dr. Pickering goes on to show , was mistaken . Mr. Bartlett in his ‘ Dictionary ’ merely abridges Pickering . Both of them should have confined the application of the word to material things , its extension to which is all that is peculiar in the supposed American use of it . For surely ‘ Complete Letter-Writers ’ have been ‘ improving this opportunity ’ time out of mind . I will illustrate the word a little further , because Pickering cites no English authorities . Skelton has a passage in his ‘ Phyllyp Sparowe , ’ which I quote the rather as it contains also the word allowed and as it distinguishes improve from employ :— ‘ His [ Chaucer 's ] Englysh well alowed , So as it is emprowed For as it is employd , There is no English voyd . ’ Here the meaning is to profit by . In Fuller 's ‘ Holy Warre ’ ( 1647 ) , we have ‘ The Egyptians standing on the firm ground , were thereby enabled to improve and enforce their darts to the utmost . ’ Here the word might certainly mean to make use of . Mrs. Hutchison ( Life of Colonel H .) uses the word in the same way : ‘ And therefore did not emproove his interest to engage the country in the quarrel . ’ Swift in one of his letters says : ‘ There is not an acre of land in Ireland turned to half its advantage ; yet it is better improved than the people . ’ I find it also in ‘ Strength out of Weakness ’ ( 1652 ) , and Plutarch 's ‘ Morals '( 1714 ) , but I know of only one example of its use in the purely American sense , and that is ‘ a very good improvement for a mill ’ in the ‘ State Trials ’ ( Speech of the Attorney . General in the Lady Ivy 's case , 1864 ) . In the sense of employ , I could cite a dozen old English authorities . In running over the fly-leaves of those delightful folios for this reference , I find a note which reminds me of another word , for our abuse of which we have been deservedly ridiculed . I mean lady , It is true I might cite the example of the Italian donna<span type="note_anchor">[ 30 ]</span>( domina ) , which has been treated in the same way by a whole nation , and not , as lady among us , by the uncultivated only . It perhaps grew into use in the half-democratic republics of Italy in the same way and for the same reasons as with us . But I admit that our abuse of the word is villainous . I know of an orator who once said in a public meeting where bonnets preponderated , that ‘ the ladies were last at the cross and first at the tomb ’ ! But similar sins were committed before our day and in the mother country . In the ‘ Harleian Miscellany ’ ( vol . v. p. 455 ) I find ‘ this lady is my servant ; the hedger 's daughter Ioan . ’ in the ‘ State Trials ’ I learn of ‘ a gentlewoman that lives cook with ’ such a one , and I hear the Lord High Steward speaking of the wife of a waiter at a bagnio as a gentlewoman ! From the same authority , by the way , I can state that our vile habit of chewing tobacco had the somewhat unsavory example of Titus Oates , and I know by tradition from an eye-witness that the elegant General Burgoyne partook of the same vice . Howell , in one of his letters ( dated 26 August , 1623 ) , speaks thus of another ‘ institution ’ which many have thought American : ‘ They speak much of that boisterous Bishop of Halverstadt ( for so they term him here ) , that , having taken a place where ther were two Monasteries of Nuns and Friers , he caus 'd divers feather-beds to be rip 'd , and all the feathers to be thrown in a great Hall , whither the Nuns and Friers were thrust naked with their bodies oil 'd and pitch 'd , and to tumble among the feathers . ’ Howell speaks as if the thing were new to him , and I know not if the ‘ boisterous ’ Bishop was the inventor of it , but I find it practised in England before our Revolution . Before leaving the subject , I will add a few comments made from time to time on the margin of Mr. Bartlett 's excellent ‘ Dictionary , ’ to which I am glad thus publicly to acknowledge my many obligations . ‘ Avails ’ is good old English , and the vails of Sir Joshua Reynolds 's porter are famous . Averse from , averse to , and in connection with them the English vulgarism ‘ different to ; ’ the corrupt use of to in these cases , as well as in the Yankee ‘ he lives to Salem , ’ ‘ to home , ’ and others , must be a very old one , for in the one case it plainly arose from confounding the two French prepositions à , ( from Latin ad and ab ) , and in the other from translating the first of them . I once thought ‘ different to ’ a modern vulgarism , and Mr. Thackeray , on my pointing it out to him in ‘ Henry Esmond , ’ confessed it to be an anachronism . Mr. Bartlett refers to ‘ the old writers quoted in Richardson 's Dictionary ’ for ‘ different to , ’ though in my edition of that work all the examples are with from . But I find to used invariably by Sir R. Hawkins in Hakluyt . Banjo is a negro corruption of O. E . bandore . Bind-weed can hardly be modern , for wood-bind is old and radically right , intertwining itself through bindan and windan with classic stems . Bobolink : is this a contraction for Bob o ’ Lincoln ? I find bobolynes , in one of the poems attributed to Skelton , where it may be rendered giddy-pate , a term very fit for the bird in his ecstasies . Cruel for great is in Hakluyt . Bowling-alley is in Nash 's ‘ Pierce Pennilesse . ’ Curious , meaning nice , occurs continually in old writers , and is as old as Pecock 's ‘ Repressor . ’ Droger is O. E . drugger . Educational is in Burke . Feeze is only a form of fizz . To fix , in the American sense , I find used by the Commissioners of the United Colonies so early as 1675 , ‘ their arms well fixed and fit for service . ’ To take the foot in the hand is German ; so is to go under . Gundalow is old ; I find gundelo in Hakluyt , and gundello in Booth 's reprint of the folio Shakespeare of 1623 . Gonoff is O. E . gnoffe . Heap is in ‘ Piers Ploughman ’ ( ‘ and other names an heep ’ ) , and in Hakluyt ( ‘ seeing such a heap of their enemies ready to devour them ’ ) . To liquor is in the ‘ Puritan ’ ( ‘ call ‘ em in , and liquor ‘ em a little ’ ) . To loaf : this , I think , is unquestionably German . Laufen is pronounced lofen in some parts of Germany , and I once heard one German student say to another , Ich lauf ( lofe ) hier bis du wiederkehrest , and he began accordingly to saunter up and down , in short , to loaf . To mull , Mr. Bartlett says , means ‘ to soften , to dispirit , ’ and quotes from ‘ Margaret , ’ — ‘ There has been a pretty considerable mullin going on among the doctors , ’ — where it surely cannot mean what he says it does . We have always heard mulling used for stirring , bustling , sometimes in an underhand way . It is a metaphor derived probably from mulling wine , and the word itself must be a corruption of mell , from O. F . mesler . Pair of stairs is in Hakluyt . To pull up stakes is in Curwen 's Journal , and therefore pre-Revolutionary . I think I have met with it earlier . Raise : under this word Mr. Bartlett omits ‘ to raise a house , ’ that is , the frame of a wooden one , and also the substantive formed from it , a raisin ’ . Retire for go to bed is in Fielding 's ‘ Amelia . ’ Setting-poles cannot be new , for I find ‘ some set [ the boats ] with long poles ’ in Hakluyt . Shoulder-hitters : I find that shoulder-striker is old , though I have lost the reference to my authority . Snag is no new word , though perhaps the Western application of it is so ; but I find in Gill the proverb , ‘ A bird in the bag is worth two on the snag . ’ Dryden has swop and to rights . Trail : Hakluyt has ‘ many wayes traled by the wilde beastes . ’ I subjoin a few phrases not in Mr. Bartlett 's book which I have heard . Bald-headed : ‘ to go it bald-beaded ; ’ in great haste , as where one rushes out without his hat . Bogue : ‘ I do n't git much done ‘ thout I bogue right in along ‘ th my men . ’ Carry : a portage . Cat-nap : a short doze . Cat-stick : a small stick . Chowder-head : a muddle-brain . Cling-john : a soft cake of rye . Cocoanut ; the head . Cohees : applied to the people of certain settlements in Western Pennsylvania , from their use of the archaic form Quo ’ he . Dunnow'z I know : the nearest your true Yankee ever comes to acknowledging ignorance . Essence-pedler : a skunk . First-rate and a half . Fish flakes , for drying fish : O. E . fleck ( cratis ) . Gander-party : a social gathering of men only . Gawnicus : a dolt . Hawkin 's whetstone : rum ; in derision of one Hawkins , a well-known temperance-lecturer . Hyper : to bustle : ‘ I mus ’ hyper about an ’ git tea . ’ Keeler-tub : one in which dishes are washed . ( ‘ And Greasy Joan doth keel the pot . ’ ) Lap-tea : where the guests are too many to sit at table . Last of pea-time : to be hard-up . Lose-laid ( loose-laid ): a weaver 's term , and probably English ; weak-willed . Malahack : to cut up hastily or awkwardly . Moonglade : a beautiful word : for the track of moonlight on the water . Off-ox : an unmanageable , cross-grained fellow . Old Driver , Old Splitfoot : the Devil . On-hitch : to pull trigger ( cf . Spanish disparar ) . Popular : conceited , Rote : sound of surf before a storm . Rot-gut : cheap whiskey ; the word occurs in Heywood 's ‘ English Traveller ’ and Addison 's ‘ Drummer , ’ for a poor kind of drink . Seem : it is habitual with the New-Englander to put this verb to strange uses , as ‘ I can n't seem to be suited , ’ ‘ I could n't seem to know him . ’ Sidehill , for hillside . State-house : this seems an Americanism , whether invented or derived from the Dutch Stad-huys , I know not . Strike and string ; from the game of ninepins ; to make a strike is to knock down all the pins with one ball , hence it has come to mean fortunate , successful . Swampers : men who break out roads for lumberers . Tormented : euphemism for damned , as , ‘ not a tormented cent . ’ Virginia fence , to make a : to walk like a drunken man . It is always worth while to note down the erratic words or phrases which one meets with in any dialect . They may throw light on the meaning of other words , on the relationship of languages , or even on history itself . In so composite a language as ours they often supply a different form to express a different shade of meaning , as in viol and fiddle , thrid and thread , smother and smoulder , where the l has crept in by a false analogy with would . We have given back to England the excellent adjective lengthy , formed honestly like earthy , drouthy , and others , thus enabling their journalists to characterize our President 's messages by a word civilly compromising between long and tedious , so as not to endanger the peace of the two countries by wounding our national sensitiveness to British criticism . Let me give two curious examples of the antiseptic property of dialects at which I have already glanced . Dante has dindi as a childish or low word for danari ( money ) , and in Shropshire small Roman coins are still dug up which the peasants call dinders . This can hardly be a chance coincidence , but seems rather to carry the word back to the Roman soldiery . So our farmers say chuk , chuk , to their pigs , and ciacco is one of the Italian words for hog . When a countryman tells us that he ‘ fell all of a heap , ’ I cannot help thinking that he unconsciously points to an affinity between our word tumble , and the Latin tumulus , that is older than most others . I believe that words , or even the mere intonation of them , have an astonishing vitality and power of propagation by the root , like the gardener 's pest , quitch-grass ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 31 ]</span>while the application or combination of them may be new . It is in these last that my countrymen seem to me full of humor , invention , quickness of wit , and that sense of subtle analogy which needs only refining to become fancy and imagination . Prosaic as American life seems in many of its aspects to a European , bleak and bare as it is on the side of tradition , and utterly orphaned of the solemn inspiration of antiquity , I cannot help thinking that the ordinary talk of unlettered men among us is fuller of metaphor and of phrases that suggest lively images than that of any other people I have seen . Very many such will be found in Mr. Bartlett 's book , though his short list of proverbs at the end seem to me , with one or two exceptions , as un-American as possible . Most of them have no character at all but coarseness , and are quite too long-skirted for working proverbs , in which language always ‘ takes off its coat to it , ’ as a Yankee would say . There are plenty that have a more native and puckery flavor , seedlings from the old stock often , and yet new varieties . One hears such not seldom among us Easterners , and the West would yield many more . ‘ Mean enough to steal acorns from a blind hog ; ’ ‘ Cold as the north side of a Jenooary gravestone by starlight ; ’ ‘ Hungry as a graven image ; ’ ‘ Pop'lar as a hen with one chicken ; ’ ‘ A hen 's time ai n't much ; ’ ‘ Quicker ‘ n greased lightnin ’ ;' ‘ Ther 's sech a thing ez bein ’ tu ’ ( our Yankee paraphrase of [ Greek : maeden agan ]) ; hence the phrase tooin ’ round , meaning a supererogatory activity like that of flies ; ‘ Stingy enough to skim his milk at both eends ; ’ ‘ Hot as the Devil 's kitchen ; ’ ‘ Handy as a pocket in a shirt ; ’ ‘ He 's a whole team and the dog under the wagon ; ’ ‘ All deacons are good , but there 's odds in deacons ’ ( to deacon berries is to put the largest atop ) ; ‘ So thievish they hev to take in their stone walls nights ;'[ 32 ] may serve as specimens . ‘ I take my tea barfoot , ’ said a backwoodsman when asked if he would have cream and sugar . ( I find barfoot , by the way , in the Coventry Plays . ) A man speaking to me once of a very rocky clearing said , ‘ Stone 's got a pretty heavy mortgage on that land , ’ and I overheard a guide in the woods say to his companions who were urging him to sing , ‘ Wal , I did sing once , but toons gut invented , an ’ thet spilt my trade . ’ Whoever has driven over a stream by a bridge made of slabs will feel the picturesque force of the epithet slab-bridged applied to a fellow of shaky character . Almost every county has some good die-sinker in phrase , whose mintage passes into the currency of the whole neighborhood . Such a one described the county jail ( the one stone building where all the dwellings are of wood ) as ‘ the house whose underpinnin ’ come up to the eaves , ’ and called hell ‘ the place where they did n't rake up their fires nights . ’ I once asked a stage-driver if the other side of a hill were as steep as the one we were climbing : ‘ Steep ? chain lightnin ’ couldn ’ go down it ‘ thout puttin ’ the shoe on ! ’ And this brings me back to the exaggeration of which I spoke before . To me there is something very taking in the negro ‘ so black that charcoal made a chalk-mark on him , ’ and the wooden shingle ‘ painted so like marble that it sank in water , ’ as if its very consciousness or its vanity had been overpersuaded by the cunning of the painter . I heard a man , in order to give a notion of some very cold weather , say to another that a certain Joe , who had been taking mercury , found a lump of quicksilver in each boot , when he went home to dinner . This power of rapidly dramatizing a dry fact into flesh and blood and the vivid conception of Joe as a human thermometer strike me as showing a poetic sense that may be refined into faculty . At any rate there is humor here , and not mere quickness of wit ,— the deeper and not the shallower quality . The tendency of humor is always towards overplus of expression , while the very essence of wit is its logical precision . Captain Basil Hall denied that our people had any humor , deceived , perhaps , by their gravity of manner . But this very seriousness is often the outward sign of that humorous quality of the mind which delights in finding an element of identity in things seemingly the most incongruous , and then again in forcing an incongruity upon things identical . Perhaps Captain Hall had no humor himself , and if so he would never find it . Did he always feel the point of what was said to himself ? I doubt it , because I happen to know a chance he once had given him in vain . The Captain was walking up and down the veranda of a country tavern in Massachusetts while the coach changed horses . A thunder-storm was going on , and , with that pleasant European air of indirect self-compliment in condescending to be surprised by American merit , which we find so conciliating , he said to a countryman lounging against the door , ‘ Pretty heavy thunder you have here . ’ The other , who had divined at a glance his feeling of generous concession to a new country , drawled gravely , ‘ Waal , we du , considerin ’ the number of inhabitants . ’ This , the more I analyze it , the more humorous does it seem . The same man was capable of wit also , when he would . He was a cabinet-maker , and was once employed to make some commandment-tables for the parish meeting-house . The parson , a very old man , annoyed him by looking into his workshop every morning , and cautioning him to be very sure to pick out ‘ clear mahogany without any knots in it . ’ At last , wearied out , he retorted one day : ‘ Wal , Dr. B ., I guess ef I was to leave the nots out o ’ some o ’ the c'man ' ments , ‘ t'ould soot you full ez wal ! ’ If I had taken the pains to write down the proverbial or pithy phrases I have heard , or if I had sooner thought of noting the Yankeeisms I met with in my reading , I might have been able to do more justice to my theme . But I have done all I wished in respect to pronunciation , if I have proved that where we are vulgar , we have the countenance of very good company . For , as to the jus et norma loquendi , I agree with Horace and those who have paraphrased or commented him , from Boileau to Gray . I think that a good rule for style is Galiani 's definition of sublime oratory ,— ‘ l'art de tout dire sans être mis à la Bastille dans un pays où il est defendu de rien dire . ’ I profess myself a fanatical purist , but with a hearty contempt for the speech-gilders who affect purism without any thorough , or even pedagogic knowledge of the engendure , growth , and affinities of the noble language about whose mésalliances they profess ( like Dean Alford ) to be so solicitous . If they had their way —! ‘ Doch es sey , ’ says Lessing , ‘ dass jene gotbische Höflichkeit eine unentbehrliche Tugend des heutigen Umganges ist . Soll sie darum unsere Schriften eben so schaal und falsch machen als unsern Umgang ? ’ And Drayton was not far wrong in affirming that ‘ Tis possible to climb , To kindle , or to slake , Although in Skelton 's rhyme . ’ Cumberland in his Memoirs tells us that when , in the midst of Admiral Rodney 's great sea-fight , Sir Charles Douglas said to him , ‘ Behold , Sir George , the Greeks and Trojans contending for the body of Patroclus ! ’ the Admiral answered , peevishly , ‘ Damn the Greeks and damn the Trojans ! I have other things to think of . ’ After the battle was won , Rodney thus to Sir Charles , ‘ Now , my dear friend , I am at the service of your Greeks and Trojans , and the whole of Homer 's Iliad , or as much of it as you please ! ’ I had some such feeling of the impertinence of our pseudo-classicality when I chose our homely dialect to work in . Should we be nothing , because somebody had contrived to be something ( and that perhaps in a provincial dialect ) ages ago ? and to be nothing by our very attempt to be that something , which they had already been , and which therefore nobody could be again without being a bore ? Is there no way left , then , I thought , of being natural , of being naïf , which means nothing more than native , of belonging to the age and country in which you are born ? The Yankee , at least , is a new phenomenon ; let us try to be that . It is perhaps a pis aller , but is not No Thoroughfare written up everywhere else ? In the literary world , things seemed to me very much as they were in the latter half of the last century . Pope , skimming the cream of good sense and expression wherever he could find it , had made , not exactly poetry , but an honest , salable butter of worldly wisdom which pleasantly lubricated some of the drier morsels of life 's daily bread , and , seeing this , scores of harmlessly insane people went on for the next fifty years coaxing his buttermilk with the regular up and down of the pentameter churn . And in our day do we not scent everywhere , and even carry away in our clothes against our will , that faint perfume of musk which Mr. Tennyson has left behind him , or worse , of Heine 's patchouli ? And might it not be possible to escape them by turning into one of our narrow New England lanes , shut in though it were by bleak stone walls on either hand , and where no better flowers were to be gathered than goldenrod and hardhack ? Beside the advantage of getting out of the beaten track , our dialect offered others hardly inferior . As I was about to make an endeavor to state them , I remembered something that the clear-sighted Goethe had said about Hebel 's ‘ Allemannische Gedichte , ’ which , making proper deduction for special reference to the book under review , expresses what I would have said far better than I could hope to do : ‘ Allen diesen innern guten Eigenschaften kommt die behagliche naive Sprache sehr zu statten . Man findet mehrere sinnlich bedeutende and wohlklingende Worte ... von einem , zwei Buchstaben , Abbreviationen , Contractionen , viele kurze , leichte Sylben , neue Reime , welches , mehr als man glaubt , ein Vortheil für den Dichter ist . Diese Elemente werden durch glückliche Constructionen und lebhafte Formen zu einem Styl zusammengedrängt der zu diesem Zwecke vor unserer Büchersprache grosse Vorzüge hat . ’ Of course I do not mean to imply that I have come near achieving any such success as the great critic here indicates , but I think the success is there , and to be plucked by some more fortunate hand . Nevertheless , I was encouraged by the approval of many whose opinions I valued . With a feeling too tender and grateful to be mixed with any vanity , I mention as one of these the late A. H. Clough , who more than any one of those I have known ( no longer living ) , except Hawthorne , impressed me with the constant presence of that indefinable thing we call genius . He often suggested that I should try my hand at some Yankee Pastorals , which would admit of more sentiment and a higher tone without foregoing the advantage offered by the dialect . I have never completed anything of the kind , but , in this Second Series , both my remembrance of his counsel and the deeper feeling called up by the great interests at stake , led me to venture some passages nearer to what is called poetical than could have been admitted without incongruity into the former series . The time seemed calling to me , with the old poet ,— ‘ Leave , then , your wonted prattle , The oaten reed forbear ; For I hear a sound of battle , And trumpets rend the air ! ’ The only attempt I had ever made at anything like a pastoral ( if that may be called an attempt which was the result almost of pure accident ) was in ‘ The Courtin ’ . ' While the introduction to the First Series was going through the press , I received word from the printer that there was a blank page left which must be filled . I sat down at once and improvised another fictitious ‘ notice of the press , ’ in which , because verse would fill up space more cheaply than prose , I inserted an extract from a supposed ballad of Mr. Biglow . I kept no copy of it , and the printer , as directed , cut it off when the gap was filled . Presently I began to receive letters asking for the rest of it , sometimes for the balance of it . I had none , but to answer such demands , I patched a conclusion upon it in a later edition . Those who had only the first continued to importune me . Afterward , being asked to write it out as an autograph for the Baltimore Sanitary Commission Fair , I added other verses , into some of which I fused a little more sentiment in a homely way , and after a fashion completed it by sketching in the characters ’ and making a connected story . Most likely I have spoiled it , but I shall put it at the end of this Introduction , to answer once for all those kindly importunings . As I have seen extracts from what purported to be writings of Mr. Biglow , which were not genuine , I may properly take this opportunity to say , that the two volumes now published contain every line I ever printed under that pseudonyme , and that I have never , so far as I can remember , written an anonymous article ( elsewhere than in the ‘ North American Review ’ and the ‘ Atlantic Monthly , ’ during my editorship of it ) except a review of Mrs. Stowe 's ‘ Minister 's Wooing , ’ and , some twenty years ago , a sketch of the antislavery movement in America for an English journal . A word more on pronunciation . I have endeavored to express this so far as I could by the types , taking such pains as , I fear , may sometimes make the reading harder than need be . At the same time , by studying uniformity I have sometimes been obliged to sacrifice minute exactness . The emphasis often modifies the habitual sound . For example , for is commonly fer ( a shorter sound than fur for far ) , but when emphatic it always becomes for , as ‘ wut for ! ’ So too is pronounced like to ( as it was anciently spelt ) , and to like ta ( the sound as in the tou of touch ) , but too , when emphatic , changes into tue , and to , sometimes , in similar cases , into toe , as ‘ I didn ’ hardly know wut toe du ! ’ Where vowels come together , or one precedes another following an aspirate , the two melt together , as was common with the older poets who formed their versification on French or Italian models . Drayton is thoroughly Yankee when he says ‘ I ‘ xpect , ’ and Pope when he says , ‘ t ’ inspire . ’ With becomes sometimes ‘ ith , ‘ [) u ] th , or ‘ th , or even disappears wholly where it comes before the , as , ‘ I went along th ’ Square ’ ( along with the Squire ) , the are sound being an archaism which I have noticed also in choir , like the old Scottish quhair .<span type="note_anchor">[ 33 ]</span>( Herrick has , ‘ Of flowers ne'er sucked by th ’ theeving bee . ’ ) Without becomes athout and ‘ thout . Afterwards always retains its locative s , and is pronounced always ahterwurds ’ , with a strong accent on the last syllable . This oddity has some support in the erratic towards ’ instead of to'wards , which we find in the poets and sometimes hear . The sound given to the first syllable of to'wards , I may remark , sustains the Yankee lengthening of the o in to . At the beginning of a sentence , ahterwurds has the accent on the first syllable ; at the end of one , on the last ; as , ‘ ah'terwurds he tol ’ me , ’ ‘ he tol ’ me ahterwurds ’ . ' The Yankee never makes a mistake in his aspirates . U changes in many words to e , always in such , brush , tush , hush , rush , blush , seldom in much , oftener in trust and crust , never in mush , gust , bust , tumble , or (? ) flush , in the latter case probably to avoid confusion with flesh . I have heard flush with the e sound , however . For the same reason , I suspect , never in gush ( at least , I never heard it ) , because we have already one gesh for gash . A and i short frequently become e short . U always becomes o in the prefix un ( except unto ) , and o in return changes to u short in uv for of , and in some words beginning with om . T and d , b and p , v and w , remain intact . So much occurs to me in addition to what I said on this head in the preface to the former volume . Of course in what I have said I wish to be understood as keeping in mind the difference between provincialisms properly so called and slang . Slang is always vulgar , because it is not a natural but an affected way of talking , and all mere tricks of speech or writing are offensive . I do not think that Mr. Biglow can be fairly charged with vulgarity , and I should have entirely failed in my design , if I had not made it appear that high and even refined sentiment may coexist with the shrewder and more comic elements of the Yankee character . I believe that what is essentially vulgar and mean-spirited in politics seldom has its source in the body of the people , but much rather among those who are made timid by their wealth or selfish by their love of power . A democracy can afford much better than an aristocracy to follow out its convictions , and is perhaps better qualified to build those convictions on plain principles of right and wrong , rather than on the shifting sands of expediency . I had always thought ‘ Sam Slick ’ a libel on the Yankee character , and a complete falsification of Yankee modes of speech , though , for aught I know , it may be true in both respects so far as the British provinces are concerned . To me the dialect was native , was spoken all about me when a boy , at a time when an Irish day-laborer was as rare as an American one now . Since then I have made a study of it so far as opportunity allowed . But when I write in it , it is as in a mother tongue , and I am carried back far beyond any studies of it to long-ago noonings in my father 's hay-fields , and to the talk of Sam and Job over their jug of blackstrap under the shadow of the ash-tree which still dapples the grass whence they have been gone so long . But life is short , and prefaces should be . And so , my good friends , to whom this introductory epistle is addressed , farewell . Though some of you have remonstrated with me , I shall never write any more ‘ Biglow Papers , ’ however great the temptation ,— great especially at the present time ,— unless it be to complete the original plan of this Series by bringing out Mr. Sawin as an ‘ original Union man . ’ The very favor with which they have been received is a hindrance to me , by forcing on me a self-consciousness from which I was entirely free when I wrote the First Series . Moreover , I am no longer the same careless youth , with nothing to do but live to myself , my books , and my friends , that I was then . I always hated politics , in the ordinary sense of the word , and I am not likely to grow , fonder of them , now that I have learned how rare it is to find a man who can keep principle clear from party and personal prejudice , or can conceive the possibility of another 's doing so . I feel as if I could in some sort claim to be an emeritus , and I am sure that political satire will have full justice done it by that genuine and delightful humorist , the Rev . Petroleum V. Nasby . I regret that I killed off Mr. Wilbur so soon , for he would have enabled me to bring into this preface a number of learned quotations , which must now go a-begging , and also enabled me to dispersonalize myself into a vicarious egotism . He would have helped me likewise in clearing myself from a charge which I shall briefly touch on , because my friend Mr. Hughes has found it needful to defend me in his preface to one of the English editions of the ‘ Biglow Papers . ’ I thank Mr. Hughes heartily for his friendly care of my good name , and were his Preface accessible to my readers here ( as I am glad it is not , for its partiality makes me blush ) , I should leave the matter where he left it . The charge is of profanity , brought in by persons who proclaimed African slavery of Divine institution , and is based ( so far as I have heard ) on two passages in the First Series — ‘ An ’ you 've gut to git up airly , Ef you want to take in God , ’ and , ‘ God 'll send the bill to you , ’ and on some Scriptural illustrations by Mr. Sawin . Now , in the first place , I was writing under an assumed character , and must talk as the person would whose mouthpiece I made myself . Will any one familiar with the New England countryman venture to tell me that he does not speak of sacred things familiarly ? that Biblical allusions ( allusions , that is , to the single book with whose language , from his church-going habits , he is intimate ) are not frequent on his lips ? If so , he cannot have pursued his studies of the character on so many long-ago muster-fields and at so many cattle-shows as I . But I scorn any such line of defence , and will confess at once that one of the things I am proud of in my countrymen is ( I am not speaking now of such persons as I have assumed Mr. Sawin to be ) that they do not put their Maker away far from them , or interpret the fear of God into being afraid of Him . The Talmudists had conceived a deep truth when they said , that ‘ all things were in the power of God , save the fear of God ; ’ and when people stand in great dread of an invisible power , I suspect they mistake quite another personage for the Deity . I might justify myself for the passages criticised by many parallel ones from Scripture , but I need not . The Reverend Homer Wilbur 's note-books supply me with three apposite quotations . The first is from a Father of the Roman Church , the second from a Father of the Anglican , and the third from a Father of Modern English poetry . The Puritan divines would furnish me with many more such . St. Bernard says , Sapiens nummularius est Deus : nummum fictum non recipiet ; ‘ A cunning money-changer is God : he will take in no base coin . ’ Latimer says , ‘ You shall perceive that God , by this example , shaketh us by the noses and taketh us by the ears . ’ Familiar enough , both of them , one would say ! But I should think Mr. Biglow had verily stolen the last of the two maligned passages from Dryden 's ‘ Don Sebastian , ’ where I find ‘ And beg of Heaven to charge the bill on me ! ’ And there I leave the matter , being willing to believe that the Saint , the Martyr , and even the Poet , were as careful of God 's honor as my critics are ever likely to be .

     <item>A beggar through the world am I , A camel-driver , angry with his drudge , A heap of bare and splintery crags , A hundred years ! they 're quickly fled , A legend that grew in the forest 's hush , A lily thou wast when I saw thee first , A poet cannot strive for despotism , A presence both by night and day , A race of nobles may die out , A stranger came one night to Yussouf 's tent , About the oak that framed this chair , of old , Alike I hate to be your debtor , Along a river-side , I know not where , Amid these fragments of heroic days , An ass munched thistles , while a nightingale , ‘ And how could you dream of meeting ? ’ Another star ‘ neath Time 's horizon dropped , Are we , then , wholly fallen ? Can it be , As a twig trembles , which a bird , As , cleansed of Tiber 's and Oblivion 's slime , As , flake by flake , the beetling avalanches , As life runs on , the road grows strange , As sinks the sun behind yon alien hills , As the broad ocean endlessly upheaveth , At Carnac in Brittany , close on the bay , At length arrived , your book I take , At twenty we fancied the blest Middle Ages , Ay , pale and silent maiden ,</item>
     <item>B , taught by Pope to do his good by stealth , Beauty on my hearth-stone blazing ! Beloved , in the noisy city here , Beneath the trees , Bowing thyself in dust before a Book ,</item>
     <item>Can this be thou who , lean and pale , Come back before the birds are flown , ‘ Come forth ! ’ my catbird calls to me , Curtis , whose Wit , with Fancy arm in arm ,</item>
     <item>Dear common flower , that grow'st beside the way , Dear M. —— By way of saving time , Dear Sir ,— You wish to know my notions , Dear Sir ,— Your letter come to han ’ , Dear Wendell , why need count the years , Death never came so nigh to me before , Do n't believe in the Flying Dutchman ? Down ‘ mid the tangled roots of things ,</item>
     <item>Ef I a song or two could make , Entranced I saw a vision in the cloud , Ere pales in Heaven the morning star ,</item>
     <item>Fair as a summer dream was Margaret , Far over Elf-land poets stretch their sway , Far through the memory shines a happy day , Far up on Katahdin thou towerest , Far ‘ yond this narrow parapet of Time , Fit for an Abbot of Theleme , For this true nobleness I seek in vain , Frank-hearted hostess of the field and wood , From the close-shut windows gleams no spark , Full oft the pathway to her door ,</item>
     <item>Giddings , far rougher names than thine have grown , Go ! leave me , Priest ; my soul would be , God ! do not let my loved one die , God makes sech nights , all white an ’ still , God sends his teachers unto every age , Godminster ? Is it Fancy 's play ? Gold of the reddening sunset , backward thrown , Gone , gone from us ! and shall we see , Great soul , thou sittest with me in my room , Great truths are portions of the soul of man , Guvener B. is a sensible man ,</item>
     <item>He came to Florence long ago , He spoke of Burns : men rude and rough , He stood upon the world 's broad threshold ; wide , He who first stretched his nerves of subtile wire , Heaven 's cup held down to me I drain , Here once my step was quickened , Here we stan ’ on the Constitution , by thunder ! Hers all that Earth could promise or bestow , Hers is a spirit deep , and crystal-clear , How strange are the freaks of memory ! How struggles with the tempest 's swells , How was I worthy so divine a loss , Hushed with broad sunlight lies the hill ,</item>
     <item>I am a man of forty , sirs , a native of East Haddam , I ask not for those thoughts , that sudden leap , I call as fly the irrevocable hours , I cannot think that thou shouldst pass away , I christened you in happier days , before , I could not bear to see those eyes , I did not praise thee when the crowd , I do not come to weep above thy pall , I do n't much s'pose , hows'ever I should plen it , I du believe in Freedom 's cause , I go to the ridge in the forest , I grieve not that ripe knowledge takes away , I had a little daughter , I have a fancy : how shall I bring it , I hed it on my min ’ las ’ time , when I to write ye started , I know a falcon swift and peerless , I love to start out arter night 's begun , I need not praise the sweetness of his song , I rise , Mr. Chairman , as both of us know , I sat and watched the walls of night , I sat one evening in my room , I saw a Sower walking slow , I saw the twinkle of white feet , I sent you a message , my friens , t'other day , I spose you recollect thet I explained my gennle views , I spose you wonder ware I be ; I can n't tell , fer the soul o ’ me , I swam with undulation soft , I thank ye , my frien 's , for the warmth o ’ your greetin ’ , I thought our love at full , but I did err , I treasure in secret some long , fine hair , I , walking the familiar street , I was with thee in Heaven : I cannot tell , I watched a moorland torrent run , I went to seek for Christ , I would more natures were like thine , I would not have this perfect love of ours , If he be a nobler lover , take him ! If I let fall a word of bitter mirth , If I were the rose at your window , In a small chamber , friendless and unseen , In good old times , which means , you know , In his tower sat the poet , In life 's small things be resolute and great , In the old days of awe and keen-eyed wonder , In town I hear , scarce wakened yet , In vain we call old notions fudge , Into the sunshine , It do n't seem hardly right , John , It is a mere wild rosebud , It mounts athwart the windy hill , It was past the hour of trysting , It 's some consid'ble of a spell sence I hai n't writ no letters ,</item>
     <item>Leaves fit to have been poor Juliet 's cradle-rhyme , Let others wonder what fair face , Light of triumph in her eyes , Look on who will in apathy , and stifle they who can , Looms there the New Land ,</item>
     <item>Maiden , when such a soul as thine is born , Mary , since first I knew thee , to this hour , Men say the sullen instrument , Men ! whose boast it is that ye , My coachman , in the moonlight there , My day began not till the twilight fell , My heart , I cannot still it , My Love , I have no fear that thou shouldst die , My name is Water : I have sped , My soul was like the sea , My worthy friend , A. Gordon Knott ,</item>
     <item>Never , surely , was holier man , New England 's poet , rich in love as years , Nine years have slipt like hour-glass sand , No ? Hez he ? He haint , though ? Wut ? Voted agin him ? Nor deemed he lived unto himself alone , Not always unimpeded can I pray , Not as all other women are , Now Biörn , the son of Heriulf , had ill days ,</item>
     <item>O days endeared to every Muse , ‘ O Dryad feet , ’ O dwellers in the valley-land , O Land of Promise ! from what Pisgah 's height , O moonlight deep and tender , O wandering dim on the extremest edge , Of all the myriad moods of mind , Oft round my hall of portraiture I gaze , Oh , tell me less or tell me more , Old events have modern meanings ; only that survives , Old Friend , farewell ! Your kindly door again , On this wild waste , where never blossom came , Once git a smell o ’ musk into a draw , Once hardly in a cycle blossometh , Once on a time there was a pool , One after one the stars have risen and set , One feast , of holy days the crest , One kiss from all others prevents me , Opening one day a book of mine , Our love is not a fading , earthly flower , Our ship lay tumbling in an angry sea , Over his keys the musing organist ,</item>
     <item>Phoebus , sitting one day in a laurel-tree 's shade , Praisest Law , friend ? We , too , love it much as they that love it best , Propped on the marsh , a dwelling now , I see , Punctorum garretos colens et cellara Quinque ,</item>
     <item>Rabbi Jehosha used to say , Reader ! Walk up at once ( it will soon be too late ) , Rippling through thy branches goes the sunshine ,</item>
     <item>Said Christ our Lord , I will go and see , Seat of all woes ? Though Nature 's firm decree , She gave me all that woman can , Shell , whose lips , than mine more cold , Ship , blest to bear such freight across the blue , Shy soul and stalwart , man of patient will , Silencioso por la puerta , Sisters two , all praise to you , Skilled to pull wires , he baffles Nature 's hope , Sleep is Death 's image ,— poets tell us so , So dreamy-soft the notes , so far away , Some sort of heart I know is hers , Sometimes come pauses of calm , when the rapt bard , holding his heart back , Somewhere in India , upon a time , Spirit , that rarely comest now , Still thirteen years : ‘ tis autumn now , Stood the tall Archangel weighing , Strong , simple , silent are the [ steadfast ] laws , Swiftly the politic goes : is it dark ?— he borrows a lantern ,</item>
     <item>Thank God , he saw you last in pomp of May , Thanks to the artist , ever on my wall , That 's a rather bold speech , my Lord Bacon , The Bardling came where by a river grew , The century numbers fourscore years , The cordage creaks and rattles in the wind , The dandelions and buttercups , The electric nerve , whose instantaneous thrill , The fire is burning clear and blithely , The hope of Truth grows stronger , day by day , The little gate was reached at last , The love of all things springs from love of one , The Maple puts her corals on in May , The misspelt scrawl , upon the wall , The moon shines white and silent , The New World 's sons , from England 's breasts we drew , The next whose fortune ‘ twas a tale to tell , The night is dark , the stinging sleet , The old Chief , feeling now wellnigh his end , The path from me to you that led , The pipe came safe , and welcome too , The rich man 's son inherits lands , The same good blood that now refills , The sea is lonely , the sea is dreary , The snow had begun in the gloaming , The tower of old Saint Nicholas soared upward to the skies , The wind is roistering out of doors , The wisest man could ask no more of Fate , The world turns mild ; democracy , they say , There are who triumph in a losing cause , There came a youth upon the earth , There lay upon the ocean 's shore , There never yet was flower fair in vain , Therefore think not the Past is wise alone , These pearls of thought in Persian gulfs were bred , These rugged , wintry days I scarce could bear , They pass me by like shadows , crowds on crowds , Thick-rushing , like an ocean vast , This is the midnight of the century ,— hark ! This kind o ’ sogerin ’ aint a mite like our October trainin ’ , This little blossom from afar , Thou look'dst on me all yesternight , Thou wast the fairest of all man-made things , Though old the thought and oft exprest , Thrash away , you 'll hev to rattle , Through suffering and sorrow thou hast passed , Thy love thou sentest oft to me , Thy voice is like a fountain , ‘ Tis a woodland enchanted ! To those who died for her on land and sea , True as the sun 's own work but more refined , True Love is a humble , low-born thing , Turbid from London 's noise and smoke , ‘ Twas sung of old in hut and hall , ‘ Twere no hard task , perchance , to win , Two brothers once , an ill-matched pair , Two fellers , Isrel named and Joe ,</item>
     <item>Unconscious as the sunshine , simply sweet , Unseen Musician , thou art sure to please , Untremulous in the river clear ,</item>
     <item>Violet ! sweet violet !</item>
     <item>Wait a little : do we not wait ? Walking alone where we walked together , We see but half the causes of our deeds , We , too , have autumns , when our leaves , We wagered , she for sunshine , I for rain , Weak-winged is song , What boot your houses and your lands ? What countless years and wealth of brain were spent , ‘ What fairings will ye that I bring ? ’ What gnarled stretch , what depth of shade , is his ! What hath Love with Thought to do ? What know we of the world immense , What man would live coffined with brick and stone , What mean these banners spread , ‘ What means this glory round our feet , ’ What Nature makes in any mood , What visionary tints the year puts on , What were I , Love , if I were stripped of thee , What were the whole void world , if thou wert dead , When a deed is done for Freedom , through the broad earth 's aching breast , When I was a beggarly boy , When oaken woods with buds are pink , When Persia 's sceptre trembled in a hand , When the down is on the chin , When wise Minerva still was young , Where is the true man 's fatherland ? ‘ Where lies the capital , pilgrim , seat of who governs the Faithful ? ’ Whether my heart hath wiser grown or not , Whether the idle prisoner through his grate , While the slow clock , as they were miser 's gold , Whither ? Albeit I follow fast , Who cometh over the hills , Who does his duty is a question , Who hath not been a poet ? Who hath not , Why should I seek her spell to decompose , With what odorous woods and spices , Woe worth the hour when it is crime , Wondrous and awful are thy silent halls , Words pass as wind , but where great deeds were done , Worn and footsore was the Prophet ,</item>
     <item>Ye little think what toil it was to build , Ye who , passing graves by night , Yes , faith is a goodly anchor ,</item>
     <item>Zekle crep ’ up , quite unbeknown ,</item>
