    <head>POEMS BY CURRER BELL</head>
    <head>PILATE 'S WIFE 'S DREAM .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I 've quench 'd my lamp , I struck it in that start</l>
     <l n="2">Which every limb convulsed , I heard it fall —</l>
     <l n="3">The crash blent with my sleep , I saw depart</l>
     <l n="4">Its light , even as I woke , on yonder wall ;</l>
     <l n="5">Over against my bed , there shone a gleam</l>
     <l n="6">Strange , faint , and mingling also with my dream .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">It sank , and I am wrapt in utter gloom ;</l>
     <l n="8">How far is night advanced , and when will day</l>
     <l n="9">Retinge the dusk and livid air with bloom ,</l>
     <l n="10">And fill this void with warm , creative ray ?</l>
     <l n="11">Would I could sleep again till , clear and red ,</l>
     <l n="12">Morning shall on the mountain-tops be spread !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">I 'd call my women , but to break their sleep ,</l>
     <l n="14">Because my own is broken , were unjust ;</l>
     <l n="15">They 've wrought all day , and well-earn 'd slumbers steep</l>
     <l n="16">Their labours in forgetfulness , I trust ;</l>
     <l n="17">Let me my feverish watch with patience bear ,</l>
     <l n="18">Thankful that none with me its sufferings share .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">Yet , oh , for light ! one ray would tranquillize</l>
     <l n="20">My nerves , my pulses , more than effort can ;</l>
     <l n="21">I 'll draw my curtain and consult the skies :</l>
     <l n="22">These trembling stars at dead of night look wan ,</l>
     <l n="23">Wild , restless , strange , yet cannot be more drear</l>
     <l n="24">Than this my couch , shared by a nameless fear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">All black — one great cloud , drawn from east to west ,</l>
     <l n="26">Conceals the heavens , but there are lights below ;</l>
     <l n="27">Torches burn in Jerusalem , and cast</l>
     <l n="28">On yonder stony mount a lurid glow .</l>
     <l n="29">I see men station 'd there , and gleaming spears ;</l>
     <l n="30">A sound , too , from afar , invades my ears .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">Dull , measured strokes of axe and hammer ring</l>
     <l n="32">From street to street , not loud , but through the night</l>
     <l n="33">Distinctly heard — and some strange spectral thing</l>
     <l n="34">Is now uprear 'd — and , fix 'd against the light</l>
     <l n="35">Of the pale lamps , defined upon that sky ,</l>
     <l n="36">It stands up like a column , straight and high .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">I see it all — I know the dusky sign —</l>
     <l n="38">A cross on Calvary , which Jews uprear</l>
     <l n="39">While Romans watch ; and when the dawn shall shine</l>
     <l n="40">Pilate , to judge the victim , will appear —</l>
     <l n="41">Pass sentence-yield Him up to crucify ;</l>
     <l n="42">And on that cross the spotless Christ must die .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="43">Dreams , then , are true — for thus my vision ran ;</l>
     <l n="44">Surely some oracle has been with me ,</l>
     <l n="45">The gods have chosen me to reveal their plan ,</l>
     <l n="46">To warn an unjust judge of destiny :</l>
     <l n="47">I , slumbering , heard and saw ; awake I know ,</l>
     <l n="48">Christ 's coming death , and Pilate 's life of woe .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="49">I do not weep for Pilate — who could prove</l>
     <l n="50">Regret for him whose cold and crushing sway</l>
     <l n="51">No prayer can soften , no appeal can move :</l>
     <l n="52">Who tramples hearts as others trample clay ,</l>
     <l n="53">Yet with a faltering , an uncertain tread ,</l>
     <l n="54">That might stir up reprisal in the dead .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="55">Forced to sit by his side and see his deeds ;</l>
     <l n="56">Forced to behold that visage , hour by hour ,</l>
     <l n="57">In whose gaunt lines the abhorrent gazer reads</l>
     <l n="58">A triple lust of gold , and blood , and power ;</l>
     <l n="59">A soul whom motives fierce , yet abject , urge —</l>
     <l n="60">Rome 's servile slave , and Judah 's tyrant scourge .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="61">How can I love , or mourn , or pity him ?</l>
     <l n="62">I , who so long my fetter 'd hands have wrung ;</l>
     <l n="63">I , who for grief have wept my eyesight dim ;</l>
     <l n="64">Because , while life for me was bright and young ,</l>
     <l n="65">He robb 'd my youth — he quench 'd my life 's fair ray —</l>
     <l n="66">He crush 'd my mind , and did my freedom slay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="67">And at this hour-although I be his wife —</l>
     <l n="68">He has no more of tenderness from me</l>
     <l n="69">Than any other wretch of guilty life ;</l>
     <l n="70">Less , for I know his household privacy —</l>
     <l n="71">I see him as he is — without a screen ;</l>
     <l n="72">And , by the gods , my soul abhors his mien !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="73">Has he not sought my presence , dyed in blood —</l>
     <l n="74">Innocent , righteous blood , shed shamelessly ?</l>
     <l n="75">And have I not his red salute withstood ?</l>
     <l n="76">Ay , when , as erst , he plunged all Galilee</l>
     <l n="77">In dark bereavement — in affliction sore ,</l>
     <l n="78">Mingling their very offerings with their gore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="79">Then came he — in his eyes a serpent-smile ,</l>
     <l n="80">Upon his lips some false , endearing word ,</l>
     <l n="81">And through the streets of Salem clang 'd the while</l>
     <l n="82">His slaughtering , hacking , sacrilegious sword —</l>
     <l n="83">And I , to see a man cause men such woe ,</l>
     <l n="84">Trembled with ire — I did not fear to show .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="85">And now , the envious Jewish priests have brought</l>
     <l n="86">Jesus — whom they in mock'ry call their king —</l>
     <l n="87">To have , by this grim power , their vengeance wrought ;</l>
     <l n="88">By this mean reptile , innocence to sting .</l>
     <l n="89">Oh ! could I but the purposed doom avert ,</l>
     <l n="90">And shield the blameless head from cruel hurt !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="91">Accessible is Pilate 's heart to fear ,</l>
     <l n="92">Omens will shake his soul , like autumn leaf ;</l>
     <l n="93">Could he this night 's appalling vision hear ,</l>
     <l n="94">This just man 's bonds were loosed , his life were safe ,</l>
     <l n="95">Unless that bitter priesthood should prevail ,</l>
     <l n="96">And make even terror to their malice quail .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="97">Yet if I tell the dream — but let me pause .</l>
     <l n="98">What dream ? Erewhile the characters were clear ,</l>
     <l n="99">Graved on my brain — at once some unknown cause</l>
     <l n="100">Has dimm 'd and razed the thoughts , which now appear ,</l>
     <l n="101">Like a vague remnant of some by-past scene ;—</l>
     <l n="102">Not what will be , but what , long since , has been .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="103">I suffer 'd many things — I heard foretold</l>
     <l n="104">A dreadful doom for Pilate ,— lingering woes ,</l>
     <l n="105">In far , barbarian climes , where mountains cold</l>
     <l n="106">Built up a solitude of trackless snows ,</l>
     <l n="107">There he and grisly wolves prowl 'd side by side ,</l>
     <l n="108">There he lived famish 'd — there , methought , he died ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="109">But not of hunger , nor by malady ;</l>
     <l n="110">I saw the snow around him , stain 'd with gore ;</l>
     <l n="111">I said I had no tears for such as he ,</l>
     <l n="112">And , lo ! my cheek is wet — mine eyes run o'er ;</l>
     <l n="113">I weep for mortal suffering , mortal guilt ,</l>
     <l n="114">I weep the impious deed , the blood self-spilt .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="115">More I recall not , yet the vision spread</l>
     <l n="116">Into a world remote , an age to come —</l>
     <l n="117">And still the illumined name of Jesus shed</l>
     <l n="118">A light , a clearness , through the unfolding gloom —</l>
     <l n="119">And still I saw that sign , which now I see ,</l>
     <l n="120">That cross on yonder brow of Calvary .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="121">What is this Hebrew Christ ? - to me unknown</l>
     <l n="122">His lineage — doctrine — mission ; yet how clear</l>
     <l n="123">Is God-like goodness in his actions shown ,</l>
     <l n="124">How straight and stainless is his life 's career !</l>
     <l n="125">The ray of Deity that rests on him ,</l>
     <l n="126">In my eyes makes Olympian glory dim .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="127">The world advances ; Greek or Roman rite</l>
     <l n="128">Suffices not the inquiring mind to stay ;</l>
     <l n="129">The searching soul demands a purer light</l>
     <l n="130">To guide it on its upward , onward way ;</l>
     <l n="131">Ashamed of sculptured gods , Religion turns</l>
     <l n="132">To where the unseen Jehovah 's altar burns .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="133">Our faith is rotten , all our rites defiled ,</l>
     <l n="134">Our temples sullied , and , methinks , this man ,</l>
     <l n="135">With his new ordinance , so wise and mild ,</l>
     <l n="136">Is come , even as He says , the chaff to fan</l>
     <l n="137">And sever from the wheat ; but will his faith</l>
     <l n="138">Survive the terrors of to-morrow 's death ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="139">I feel a firmer trust — a higher hope</l>
     <l n="140">Rise in my soul — it dawns with dawning day ;</l>
     <l n="141">Lo ! on the Temple 's roof — on Moriah 's slope</l>
     <l n="142">Appears at length that clear and crimson ray</l>
     <l n="143">Which I so wished for when shut in by night ;</l>
     <l n="144">Oh , opening skies , I hail , I bless pour light !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="145">Part , clouds and shadows ! Glorious Sun appear !</l>
     <l n="146">Part , mental gloom ! Come insight from on high !</l>
     <l n="147">Dusk dawn in heaven still strives with daylight clear</l>
     <l n="148">The longing soul doth still uncertain sigh .</l>
     <l n="149">Oh ! to behold the truth — that sun divine ,</l>
     <l n="150">How doth my bosom pant , my spirit pine !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="151">This day , Time travails with a mighty birth ;</l>
     <l n="152">This day , Truth stoops from heaven and visits earth ;</l>
     <l n="153">Ere night descends I shall more surely know</l>
     <l n="154">What guide to follow , in what path to go ;</l>
     <l n="155">I wait in hope — I wait in solemn fear ,</l>
     <l n="156">The oracle of God — the sole — true God — to hear .</l>

    <head>MEMENTOS .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Arranging long-locked drawers and shelves</l>
     <l n="2">Of cabinets , shut up for years ,</l>
     <l n="3">What a strange task we 've set ourselves !</l>
     <l n="4">How still the lonely room appears !</l>
     <l n="5">How strange this mass of ancient treasures ,</l>
     <l n="6">Mementos of past pains and pleasures ;</l>
     <l n="7">These volumes , clasped with costly stone ,</l>
     <l n="8">With print all faded , gilding gone ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">These fans of leaves from Indian trees —</l>
     <l n="10">These crimson shells , from Indian seas —</l>
     <l n="11">These tiny portraits , set in rings —</l>
     <l n="12">Once , doubtless , deemed such precious things ;</l>
     <l n="13">Keepsakes bestowed by Love on Faith ,</l>
     <l n="14">And worn till the receiver 's death ,</l>
     <l n="15">Now stored with cameos , china , shells ,</l>
     <l n="16">In this old closet 's dusty cells .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">I scarcely think , for ten long years ,</l>
     <l n="18">A hand has touched these relics old ;</l>
     <l n="19">And , coating each , slow-formed , appears</l>
     <l n="20">The growth of green and antique mould .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="21">All in this house is mossing over ;</l>
     <l n="22">All is unused , and dim , and damp ;</l>
     <l n="23">Nor light , nor warmth , the rooms discover —</l>
     <l n="24">Bereft for years of fire and lamp .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">The sun , sometimes in summer , enters</l>
     <l n="26">The casements , with reviving ray ;</l>
     <l n="27">But the long rains of many winters</l>
     <l n="28">Moulder the very walls away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="29">And outside all is ivy , clinging</l>
     <l n="30">To chimney , lattice , gable grey ;</l>
     <l n="31">Scarcely one little red rose springing</l>
     <l n="32">Through the green moss can force its way .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="33">Unscared , the daw and starling nestle ,</l>
     <l n="34">Where the tall turret rises high ,</l>
     <l n="35">And winds alone come near to rustle</l>
     <l n="36">The thick leaves where their cradles lie ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="37">I sometimes think , when late at even</l>
     <l n="38">I climb the stair reluctantly ,</l>
     <l n="39">Some shape that should be well in heaven ,</l>
     <l n="40">Or ill elsewhere , will pass by me .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="41">I fear to see the very faces ,</l>
     <l n="42">Familiar thirty years ago ,</l>
     <l n="43">Even in the old accustomed places</l>
     <l n="44">Which look so cold and gloomy now ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="45">I 've come , to close the window , hither ,</l>
     <l n="46">At twilight , when the sun was down ,</l>
     <l n="47">And Fear my very soul would wither ,</l>
     <l n="48">Lest something should be dimly shown ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="49">Too much the buried form resembling ,</l>
     <l n="50">Of her who once was mistress here ;</l>
     <l n="51">Lest doubtful shade , or moonbeam trembling ,</l>
     <l n="52">Might take her aspect , once so dear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="53">Hers was this chamber ; in her time</l>

     <l n="60">Blest in her youth , blest in her worth ;</l>

     <l n="67">These grim oak walls even then were grim ;</l>
     <l n="68">That old carved chair was then antique ;</l>
     <l n="69">But what around looked dusk and dim</l>
     <l n="70">Served as a foil to her fresh cheek ;</l>

     <l n="72">Eyes of unclouded , smiling light ;</l>
     <l n="73">Her soft , and curled , and floating hair ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="75">Reclined in yonder deep recess ,</l>

     <l n="84">A cloudless moon , on summer night ,</l>
     <l n="85">Full oft have I impatience proved</l>
     <l n="86">To see how long her still delight</l>
     <l n="87">Would find a theme in reverie ,</l>
     <l n="88">Out on the lawn , or where the trees</l>
     <l n="89">Let in the lustre fitfully ,</l>
     <l n="90">As their boughs parted momently ,</l>
     <l n="91">To the soft , languid , summer breeze .</l>
     <l n="92">Alas ! that she should e'er have flung</l>
     <l n="93">Those pure , though lonely joys away —</l>
     <l n="94">Deceived by false and guileful tongue ,</l>
     <l n="95">She gave her hand , then suffered wrong ;</l>
     <l n="96">Oppressed , ill-used , she faded young ,</l>

     <l n="103">How dim lies Time 's discolouring stain !</l>
     <l n="104">I 've seen that by her daughter worn :</l>
     <l n="105">For , ere she died , a child was born ;—</l>
     <l n="106">A child that ne'er its mother knew ,</l>
     <l n="107">That lone , and almost friendless grew ;</l>
     <l n="108">For , ever , when its step drew nigh ,</l>
     <l n="109">Averted was the father 's eye ;</l>
     <l n="110">And then , a life impure and wild</l>
     <l n="111">Made him a stranger to his child :</l>
     <l n="112">Absorbed in vice , he little cared</l>
     <l n="113">On what she did , or how she fared .</l>
     <l n="114">The love withheld she never sought ,</l>
     <l n="115">She grew uncherished — learnt untaught ;</l>
     <l n="116">To her the inward life of thought</l>
     <l n="117">Full soon was open laid .</l>
     <l n="118">I know not if her friendlessness</l>
     <l n="119">Did sometimes on her spirit press ,</l>
     <l n="120">But plaint she never made .</l>
     <l n="121">The book-shelves were her darling treasure ,</l>
     <l n="122">She rarely seemed the time to measure</l>
     <l n="123">While she could read alone .</l>
     <l n="124">And she too loved the twilight wood</l>
     <l n="125">And often , in her mother 's mood ,</l>
     <l n="126">Away to yonder hill would hie ,</l>
     <l n="127">Like her , to watch the setting sun ,</l>
     <l n="128">Or see the stars born , one by one ,</l>
     <l n="129">Out of the darkening sky .</l>
     <l n="130">Nor would she leave that hill till night</l>
     <l n="131">Trembled from pole to pole with light ;</l>
     <l n="132">Even then , upon her homeward way ,</l>
     <l n="133">Long — long her wandering steps delayed</l>
     <l n="134">To quit the sombre forest shade ,</l>
     <l n="135">Through which her eerie pathway lay .</l>
     <l n="136">You ask if she had beauty 's grace ?</l>
     <l n="137">I know not — but a nobler face</l>
     <l n="138">My eyes have seldom seen ;</l>
     <l n="139">A keen and fine intelligence ,</l>
     <l n="140">And , better still , the truest sense</l>
     <l n="141">Were in her speaking mien .</l>
     <l n="142">But bloom or lustre was there none ,</l>
     <l n="143">Only at moments , fitful shone</l>
     <l n="144">An ardour in her eye ,</l>
     <l n="145">That kindled on her cheek a flush ,</l>
     <l n="146">Warm as a red sky 's passing blush</l>
     <l n="147">And quick with energy .</l>
     <l n="148">Her speech , too , was not common speech ,</l>
     <l n="149">No wish to shine , or aim to teach ,</l>
     <l n="150">Was in her words displayed :</l>
     <l n="151">She still began with quiet sense ,</l>
     <l n="152">But oft the force of eloquence</l>
     <l n="153">Came to her lips in aid ;</l>
     <l n="154">Language and voice unconscious changed ,</l>
     <l n="155">And thoughts , in other words arranged ,</l>
     <l n="156">Her fervid soul transfused</l>
     <l n="157">Into the hearts of those who heard ,</l>
     <l n="158">And transient strength and ardour stirred ,</l>
     <l n="159">In minds to strength unused ,</l>
     <l n="160">Yet in gay crowd or festal glare ,</l>
     <l n="161">Grave and retiring was her air ;</l>
     <l n="162">‘ Twas seldom , save with me alone ,</l>
     <l n="163">That fire of feeling freely shone ;</l>
     <l n="164">She loved not awe 's nor wonder 's gaze ,</l>
     <l n="165">Nor even exaggerated praise ,</l>
     <l n="166">Nor even notice , if too keen</l>
     <l n="167">The curious gazer searched her mien .</l>
     <l n="168">Nature 's own green expanse revealed</l>
     <l n="169">The world , the pleasures , she could prize ;</l>
     <l n="170">On free hill-side , in sunny field ,</l>
     <l n="171">In quiet spots by woods concealed ,</l>

     <l n="179">But soon her mind 's maturer might</l>
     <l n="180">For stronger task did pant and yearn ;</l>
     <l n="181">And stronger task did fate assign ,</l>
     <l n="182">Task that a giant 's strength might strain ;</l>
     <l n="183">To suffer long and ne'er repine ,</l>

     <l n="68">For the atoning hour to come .</l>

    <head>SELECTIONS FROM THE LITERARY REMAINS OF ELLIS AND ACTON BELL .</head>
     <l n="1">By Currer Bell</l>
   </lg>
   <p>SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ELLIS BELL .</p>
   <p>It would not have been difficult to compile a volume out of the papers left by my sisters , had I , in making the selection , dismissed from my consideration the scruples and the wishes of those whose written thoughts these papers held . But this was impossible : an influence , stronger than could be exercised by any motive of expediency , necessarily regulated the selection . I have , then , culled from the mass only a little poem here and there . The whole makes but a tiny nosegay , and the colour and perfume of the flowers are not such as fit them for festal uses .</p>
   <p>It has been already said that my sisters wrote much in childhood and girlhood . Usually , it seems a sort of injustice to expose in print the crude thoughts of the unripe mind , the rude efforts of the unpractised hand ; yet I venture to give three little poems of my sister Emily 's , written in her sixteenth year , because they illustrate a point in her character .</p>
   <p>At that period she was sent to school . Her previous life , with the exception of a single half-year , had been passed in the absolute retirement of a village parsonage , amongst the hills bordering Yorkshire and Lancashire . The scenery of these hills is not grand — it is not romantic it is scarcely striking . Long low moors , dark with heath , shut in little valleys , where a stream waters , here and there , a fringe of stunted copse . Mills and scattered cottages chase romance from these valleys ; it is only higher up , deep in amongst the ridges of the moors , that Imagination can find rest for the sole of her foot : and even if she finds it there , she must be a solitude-loving raven — no gentle dove . If she demand beauty to inspire her , she must bring it inborn : these moors are too stern to yield any product so delicate . The eye of the gazer must ITSELF brim with a “ purple light , ” intense enough to perpetuate the brief flower-flush of August on the heather , or the rare sunset-smile of June ; out of his heart must well the freshness , that in latter spring and early summer brightens the bracken , nurtures the moss , and cherishes the starry flowers that spangle for a few weeks the pasture of the moor-sheep . Unless that light and freshness are innate and self-sustained , the drear prospect of a Yorkshire moor will be found as barren of poetic as of agricultural interest : where the love of wild nature is strong , the locality will perhaps be clung to with the more passionate constancy , because from the hill-lover 's self comes half its charm .</p>
   <p>My sister Emily loved the moors . Flowers brighter than the rose bloomed in the blackest of the heath for her ; out of a sullen hollow in a livid hill-side her mind could make an Eden . She found in the bleak solitude many and dear delights ; and not the least and best loved was — liberty .</p>
   <p>Liberty was the breath of Emily 's nostrils ; without it , she perished . The change from her own home to a school , and from her own very noiseless , very secluded , but unrestricted and inartificial mode of life , to one of disciplined routine ( though under the kindliest auspices ) , was what she failed in enduring . Her nature proved here too strong for her fortitude . Every morning when she woke , the vision of home and the moors rushed on her , and darkened and saddened the day that lay before her . Nobody knew what ailed her but me — I knew only too well . In this struggle her health was quickly broken : her white face , attenuated form , and failing strength , threatened rapid decline . I felt in my heart she would die , if she did not go home , and with this conviction obtained her recall . She had only been three months at school ; and it was some years before the experiment of sending her from home was again ventured on . After the age of twenty , having meantime studied alone with diligence and perseverance , she went with me to an establishment on the Continent : the same suffering and conflict ensued , heightened by the strong recoil of her upright , heretic and English spirit from the gentle Jesuitry of the foreign and Romish system . Once more she seemed sinking , but this time she rallied through the mere force of resolution : with inward remorse and shame she looked back on her former failure , and resolved to conquer in this second ordeal . She did conquer : but the victory cost her dear . She was never happy till she carried her hard-won knowledge back to the remote English village , the old parsonage-house , and desolate Yorkshire hills . A very few years more , and she looked her last on those hills , and breathed her last in that house , and under the aisle of that obscure village church found her last lowly resting-place . Merciful was the decree that spared her when she was a stranger in a strange land , and guarded her dying bed with kindred love and congenial constancy .</p>
   <p>The following pieces were composed at twilight , in the school-room , when the leisure of the evening play-hour brought back in full tide the thoughts of home .</p>

   <p>SELECTIONS FROM POEMS BY ACTON BELL .</p>
   <p>In looking over my sister Anne 's papers , I find mournful evidence that religious feeling had been to her but too much like what it was to Cowper ; I mean , of course , in a far milder form . Without rendering her a prey to those horrors that defy concealment , it subdued her mood and bearing to a perpetual pensiveness ; the pillar of a cloud glided constantly before her eyes ; she ever waited at the foot of a secret Sinai , listening in her heart to the voice of a trumpet sounding long and waxing louder . Some , perhaps , would rejoice over these tokens of sincere though sorrowing piety in a deceased relative : I own , to me they seem sad , as if her whole innocent life had been passed under the martyrdom of an unconfessed physical pain : their effect , indeed , would be too distressing , were it not combated by the certain knowledge that in her last moments this tyranny of a too tender conscience was overcome ; this pomp of terrors broke up , and passing away , left her dying hour unclouded . Her belief in God did not then bring to her dread , as of a stern Judge ,— but hope , as in a Creator and Saviour : and no faltering hope was it , but a sure and stedfast conviction , on which , in the rude passage from Time to Eternity , she threw the weight of her human weakness , and by which she was enabled to bear what was to be borne , patiently — serenely — victoriously .</p>
