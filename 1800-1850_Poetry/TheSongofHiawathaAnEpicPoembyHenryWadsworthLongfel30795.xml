    <docImprint>The Song of Hiawatha first appeared in<date>1855</date>. In it Mr. Longfellow has woven together the beautiful traditions of the American Indians into one grand and delightful epic poem . The melodies of its rhythm and measure flow from his classic pen in unison with the hoof-beats of the bison , the tremulous thunder of the Falls of Minnehaha , the paddle strokes of the Indian canoeist , and he has done more to immortalize in song and story the life and environments of the red man of<country>America</country>than any other writer , save perhaps J. Fenimore Cooper . It was from a perusal of the Finnish epic “ Kalevala ” that both the measure and the style of “ Hiawatha ” was suggested to Mr. Longfellow . In fact , it might appropriately be named the “ Kalevala ” of North<country>America</country>. Mr. Longfellow derived his knowledge of Indian legends from Schoolcraft 's Algic Researches and other books , from Heckewelder 's Narratives , from Black Hawk , with his display of Sacs and Foxes on<settlement>Boston</settlement>Common , and from the Ojibway chief , Kahge-gagah-bowh , whom he entertained at his own home . Hiawatha had a wide circulation , both in<country>America</country>and Europe , and was universally admired by readers and critics on both Continents . Large audiences gathered to hear it read by public readers . It was set to music by Stoepel , and at the<settlement>Boston</settlement>Theater it was rendered with explanatory readings by the famous elocutionist , Matilda Heron . The highest encomiums were passed upon it by such critics of ripe scholarship as Emerson and Hawthorne . A part of it was translated into Latin and used as an academic text book . Those who wish to read more about it will find interest and pleasure in perusing the masterly criticisms of Dr. O. W. Holmes in the Annals of the Massachusetts Historical Society , and that of Horatio Hale in the Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ,<date>1881</date>.</docImprint>

    <head>INTRODUCTION .</head>
    <p n="1">Should you ask me , whence these stories ? Whence these legends and traditions , With the odors of the forest , With the dew and damp of meadows , With the curling smoke of wigwams , 5 With the rushing of great rivers , With their frequent repetitions , And their wild reverberations , As of thunder in the mountains ? I should answer , I should tell you , 10 “ From the forests and the prairies , From the great lakes of the Northland , From the land of the Ojibways , From the land of the Dacotahs , From the mountains , moors , and fen-lands , 15 Where the heron , the Shuh-shuh-gah , Feeds among the reeds and rushes . I repeat them as I heard them From the lips of Nawadaha , The musician , the sweet singer . ” 20 Should you ask where Nawadaha Found these songs so wild and wayward , Found these legends and traditions , I should answer , I should tell you , “ In the bird'shYpppHeNnests of the forest , 25 In the lodges of the beaver , In the hoof-prints of the bison , In the eyry of the eagle ! “ All the wild-fowl sang them to him , In the moorlands and the fen-lands , 30 In the melancholy marshes ; Chetowaik , the plover , sang them , Mahn , the loon , the wild goose , Wawa , The blue heron , the Shuh-shuh-gah And the grouse , the Mushkodasa ! ” 35 If still further you should ask me , Saying , “ Who was Nawadaha ? Tell us of this Nawadaha , ” I should answer your inquiries Straightway in such words as follow . 40 “ In the Vale of Tawasentha , In the green and silent valley , By the pleasant water-courses , Dwelt the singer Nawadaha . Round about the Indian village 45 Spread the meadows and the cornfields , And beyond them stood the forest , Stood the groves of singing pine-trees , Green in Summer , white in Winter , Ever sighing , ever singing . 50 “ And the pleasant water-courses , You could trace them through the valley , By the rushing in the Spring-time , By the alders in the Summer , By the white fog in the Autumn , 55 By the black line in the Winter ; And beside them dwelt the singer , In the vale of Tawasentha , In the green and silent valley . “ There he sang of Hiawatha , 60 Sang the Song of Hiawatha , Sang his wondrous birth and being , How he prayed and how he fasted , How he lived , and toiled , and suffered That the tribes of men might prosper , 65 That he might advance his people ! ” Ye who love the haunts of Nature , Love the sunshine of the meadow , Love the shadow of the forest , Love the wind among the branches , 70 And the rain-shower and the snow-storm , And the rushing of great rivers Through their palisades of pine-trees , And the thunder in the mountains , Whose innumerable echoes 75 Flap like eagles in their eyries ;— Listen to these wild traditions , To this Song of Hiawatha ! Ye who love a nation 's legends Love the ballads of a people , 80 That like voices from afar off Call to us to pause and listen , Speak in tones so plain and childlike , Scarcely can the ear distinguish Whether they are sung or spoken ;— 85 Listen to this Indian Legend , To this Song of Hiawatha ! Ye whose hearts are fresh and simple , Who have faith in God and Nature , Who believe that in all ages 90 Every human heart is human , That in even savage bosoms There are longings , yearnings , strivings For the good they comprehend not , That the feeble hands and helpless , 95 Groping blindly in the darkness , Touch God 's right hand in that darkness , And are lifted up and strengthened ;— Listen to this simple story , To this song of Hiawatha ! 100 Ye who sometimes , in your rambles Through the green lanes of the country , Where the tangled barberry-bushes Hang their tufts of crimson berries Over stone walls gray with mosses , 105 Pause by some neglected graveyard , For a while to muse , and ponder On a half-effaced inscription , Written with little skill of song-craft , Homely phrases , but each letter 110 Full of hope and yet of heart-break , Full of all the tender pathos Of the Here and the Hereafter ;— Stay and read this rude inscription , Read this song of Hiawatha ! 115</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">On the Mountains of the Prairie ,</l>
     <l n="2">On the great Red Pipe-stone Quarry ,</l>
     <l n="3">Gitche Manito , the mighty ,</l>
     <l n="4">He the Master of Life , descending ,</l>
     <l n="5">On the red crags of the quarry 5</l>
     <l n="6">Stood erect , and called the nations ,</l>
     <l n="7">Called the tribes of men together .</l>
     <l n="8">From his footprints flowed a river ,</l>
     <l n="9">Leaped into the light of morning ,</l>
     <l n="10">O'er the precipice plunging downward 10</l>
     <l n="11">Gleamed like Ishkoodah , the comet .</l>
     <l n="12">And the Spirit , stooping earthward ,</l>
     <l n="13">With his finger on the meadow</l>
     <l n="14">Traced a winding pathway for it ,</l>
     <l n="15">Saying to it , “ Run in this way ! ” 15</l>
     <l n="16">From the red stone of the quarry</l>
     <l n="17">With his hand he broke a fragment ,</l>
     <l n="18">Moulded it into a pipe-head ,</l>
     <l n="19">Shaped and fashioned it with figures ;</l>
     <l n="20">From the margin of the river 20</l>
     <l n="21">Took a long reed for a pipe-stem ,</l>
     <l n="22">With its dark green leaves upon it ,</l>
     <l n="23">Filled the pipe with bark of willow ,</l>
     <l n="24">With the bark of the red willow ;</l>
     <l n="25">Breathed upon the neighboring forest , 25</l>
     <l n="26">Made its great boughs chafe together ,</l>
     <l n="27">Till in flame they burst and kindled ;</l>
     <l n="28">And erect upon the mountains ,</l>
     <l n="29">Gitche Manito , the mighty ,</l>
     <l n="30">Smoked the calumet , the Peace-Pipe , 30</l>
     <l n="31">As a signal to the nations .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="32">And the smoke rose slowly , slowly ,</l>
     <l n="33">Through the tranquil air of morning ,</l>
     <l n="34">First a single line of darkness ,</l>
     <l n="35">Then a denser , bluer vapor , 35</l>
     <l n="36">Then a snow-white cloud unfolding ,</l>
     <l n="37">Like the tree-tops of the forest ,</l>
     <l n="38">Ever rising , rising , rising ,</l>
     <l n="39">Till it touched the top of heaven ,</l>
     <l n="40">Till it broke against the heaven , 40</l>
     <l n="41">And rolled outward all around it .</l>
     <l n="42">From the Vale of Tawasentha ,</l>
     <l n="43">From the Valley of Wyoming ,</l>
     <l n="44">From the groves of Tuscaloosa ,</l>
     <l n="45">From the far-off Rocky Mountains , 45</l>
     <l n="46">From the Northern lakes and rivers ,</l>
     <l n="47">All the tribes beheld the signal ,</l>
     <l n="48">Saw the distant smoke ascending ,</l>
     <l n="49">The Pukwana of the Peace-Pipe .</l>
     <l n="50">And the Prophets of the nations 50</l>
     <l n="51">Said : “ Behold it , the Pukwana !</l>
     <l n="52">By this signal from afar off ,</l>
     <l n="53">Bending like a wand of willow ,</l>
     <l n="54">Waving like a hand that beckons ,</l>
     <l n="55">Gitche Manito , the mighty , 55</l>
     <l n="56">Calls the tribes of men together ,</l>
     <l n="57">Calls the warriors to his council ! ”</l>
     <l n="58">Down the rivers , o'er the prairies ,</l>
     <l n="59">Came the warriors of the nations ,</l>
     <l n="60">Came the Delawares and Mohawks , 60</l>
     <l n="61">Came the Choctaws and Camanches ,</l>
     <l n="62">Came the Shoshonies and Blackfeet ,</l>
     <l n="63">Came the Pawnees and Omahas ,</l>
     <l n="64">Came the Mandans and Dacotahs ,</l>
     <l n="65">Came the Hurons and Ojibways , 65</l>
     <l n="66">All the warriors drawn together</l>
     <l n="67">By the signal of the Peace-Pipe ,</l>
     <l n="68">To the Mountains of the Prairie ,</l>
     <l n="69">To the great Red Pipe-stone Quarry .</l>
     <l n="70">And they stood there on the meadow , 70</l>
     <l n="71">With their weapons and their war-gear ,</l>
     <l n="72">Painted like the leaves of Autumn ,</l>
     <l n="73">Painted like the sky of morning ,</l>
     <l n="74">Wildly glaring at each other ;</l>
     <l n="75">In their faces stern defiance , 75</l>
     <l n="76">In their hearts the feuds of ages ,</l>
     <l n="77">The hereditary hatred ,</l>
     <l n="78">The ancestral thirst of vengeance .</l>
     <l n="79">Gitche Manito , the mighty ,</l>
     <l n="80">The creator of the nations , 80</l>
     <l n="81">Looked upon them with compassion ,</l>
     <l n="82">With paternal love and pity ;</l>
     <l n="83">Looked upon their wrath and wrangling</l>
     <l n="84">But as quarrels among children ,</l>
     <l n="85">But as feuds and fights of children ! 85</l>
     <l n="86">Over them he stretched his right hand ,</l>
     <l n="87">To subdue their stubborn natures ,</l>
     <l n="88">To allay their thirst and fever ,</l>
     <l n="89">By the shadow of his right hand ;</l>
     <l n="90">Spake to them with voice majestic 90</l>
     <l n="91">As the sound of far-off waters</l>
     <l n="92">Falling into deep abysses ,</l>
     <l n="93">Warning , chiding , spake in this wise :—</l>
     <l n="94">“ O my children ! my poor children !</l>
     <l n="95">Listen to the words of wisdom , 95</l>
     <l n="96">Listen to the words of warning ,</l>
     <l n="97">From the lips of the Great Spirit ,</l>
     <l n="98">From the Master of Life , who made you !</l>
     <l n="99">“ I have given you lands to hunt in ,</l>
     <l n="100">I have given you streams to fish in , 100</l>
     <l n="101">I have given you bear and bison ,</l>
     <l n="102">I have given you roe and reindeer ,</l>
     <l n="103">I have given you brant and beaver ,</l>
     <l n="104">Filled the marshes full of wild fowl ,</l>
     <l n="105">Filled the rivers full of fishes ; 105</l>
     <l n="106">Why then are you not contented ?</l>
     <l n="107">Why then will you hunt each other ?</l>
     <l n="108">“ I am weary of your quarrels ,</l>
     <l n="109">Weary of your wars and bloodshed ,</l>
     <l n="110">Weary of your prayers for vengeance , 110</l>
     <l n="111">Of your wranglings and dissensions ;</l>
     <l n="112">All your strength is in your union ,</l>
     <l n="113">All your danger is in discord ;</l>
     <l n="114">Therefore be at peace henceforward ,</l>
     <l n="115">And as brothers live together . 115</l>
     <l n="116">“ I will send a Prophet to you ,</l>
     <l n="117">A Deliverer of the nations ,</l>
     <l n="118">Who shall guide you and shall teach you ,</l>
     <l n="119">Who shall toil and suffer with you .</l>
     <l n="120">If you listen to his counsels , 120</l>
     <l n="121">You will multiply and prosper ;</l>
     <l n="122">If his warnings pass unheeded ,</l>
     <l n="123">You will fade away and perish !</l>
     <l n="124">“ Bathe now in the stream before you ,</l>
     <l n="125">Wash the war-paint from your faces , 125</l>
     <l n="126">Wash the blood-stains from your fingers ,</l>
     <l n="127">Bury your war-clubs and your weapons ,</l>
     <l n="128">Break the red stone from this quarry ,</l>
     <l n="129">Mould and make it into Peace-Pipes ,</l>
     <l n="130">Take the reeds that grow beside you , 130</l>
     <l n="131">Deck them with your brightest feathers ,</l>
     <l n="132">Smoke the calumet together ,</l>
     <l n="133">And as brothers live henceforward ! ”</l>
     <l n="134">Then upon the ground the warriors</l>
     <l n="135">Threw their cloaks and shirts of deer-skin , 135</l>
     <l n="136">Threw their weapons and their war-gear ,</l>
     <l n="137">Leaped into the rushing river ,</l>
     <l n="138">Washed the war-paint from their faces .</l>
     <l n="139">Clear above them flowed the water ,</l>
     <l n="140">Clear and limpid from the footprints 140</l>
     <l n="141">Of the Master of Life descending ;</l>
     <l n="142">Dark below them flowed the water ,</l>
     <l n="143">Soiled and stained with streaks of crimson ,</l>
     <l n="144">As if blood were mingled with it !</l>
     <l n="145">From the river came the warriors , 145</l>
     <l n="146">Clean and washed from all their war-paint ;</l>
     <l n="147">On the banks their clubs they buried ,</l>
     <l n="148">Buried all their warlike weapons ,</l>
     <l n="149">Gitche Manito , the mighty ,</l>
     <l n="150">The Great Spirit , the creator , 150</l>
     <l n="151">Smiled upon his helpless children !</l>
     <l n="152">And in silence all the warriors</l>
     <l n="153">Broke the red stone of the quarry ,</l>
     <l n="154">Smoothed and formed it into Peace-Pipes ,</l>
     <l n="155">Broke the long reeds by the river , 155</l>
     <l n="156">Decked them with their brightest feathers ,</l>
     <l n="157">And departed each one homeward ,</l>
     <l n="158">While the Master of Life , ascending ,</l>
     <l n="159">Through the opening of cloud-curtains ,</l>
     <l n="160">Through the doorways of the heaven , 160</l>
     <l n="161">Vanished from before their faces ,</l>

     <l n="10">From the Great Bear of the mountains , 10</l>
     <l n="11">From the terror of the nations ,</l>
     <l n="12">As he lay asleep and cumbrous</l>
     <l n="13">On the summit of the mountains ,</l>
     <l n="14">Like a rock with mosses on it ,</l>
     <l n="15">Spotted brown and gray with mosses . 15</l>
     <l n="16">Silently he stole upon him ,</l>
     <l n="17">Till the red nails of the monster</l>
     <l n="18">Almost touched him , almost scared him ,</l>
     <l n="19">Till the hot breath of his nostrils</l>
     <l n="20">Warmed the hands of Mudjekeewis , 20</l>
     <l n="21">As he drew the Belt of Wampum</l>
     <l n="22">Over the round ears , that heard not ,</l>
     <l n="23">Over the small eyes , that saw not ,</l>
     <l n="24">Over the long nose and nostrils ,</l>
     <l n="25">The black muffle of the nostrils , 25</l>
     <l n="26">Out of which the heavy breathing</l>
     <l n="27">Warmed the hands of Mudjekeewis .</l>
     <l n="28">Then he swung aloft his war-club ,</l>
     <l n="29">Shouted loud and long his war-cry ,</l>
     <l n="30">Smote the mighty Mishe-Mokwa 30</l>
     <l n="31">In the middle of the forehead ,</l>
     <l n="32">Right between the eyes he smote him .</l>
     <l n="33">With the heavy blow bewildered ,</l>
     <l n="34">Rose the Great Bear of the mountains ;</l>
     <l n="35">But his knees beneath him trembled , 35</l>
     <l n="36">And he whimpered like a woman ,</l>
     <l n="37">As he reeled and staggered forward ,</l>
     <l n="38">As he sat upon his haunches ;</l>
     <l n="39">And the mighty Mudjekeewis ,</l>
     <l n="40">Standing fearlessly before him , 40</l>
     <l n="41">Taunted him in loud derision ,</l>
     <l n="42">Spake disdainfully in this wise :—</l>
     <l n="43">“ Hark you , Bear ! you are a coward ,</l>
     <l n="44">And no Brave , as you pretended ;</l>
     <l n="45">Else you would not cry and whimper 45</l>
     <l n="46">Like a miserable woman !</l>
     <l n="47">Bear ! you know our tribes are hostile ,</l>
     <l n="48">Long have been at war together ;</l>
     <l n="49">Now you find that we are strongest ,</l>
     <l n="50">You go sneaking in the forest , 50</l>
     <l n="51">You go hiding in the mountains !</l>
     <l n="52">Had you conquered me in battle</l>
     <l n="53">Not a groan would I have uttered ;</l>
     <l n="54">But you , Bear ! sit here and whimper ,</l>
     <l n="55">And disgrace your tribe by crying , 55</l>
     <l n="56">Like a wretched Shaugodaya ,</l>
     <l n="57">Like a cowardly old woman ! ”</l>
     <l n="58">Then again he raised his war-club ,</l>
     <l n="59">Smote again the Mishe-Mokwa</l>
     <l n="60">In the middle of his forehead , 60</l>
     <l n="61">Broke his skull , as ice is broken</l>
     <l n="62">When one goes to fish in Winter .</l>
     <l n="63">Thus was slain the Mishe-Mokwa ,</l>
     <l n="64">He the Great Bear of the mountains ,</l>
     <l n="65">He the terror of the nations . 65</l>
     <l n="66">“ Honor be to Mudjekeewis ! ”</l>
     <l n="67">With a shout exclaimed the people ,</l>
     <l n="68">“ Honor be to Mudjekeewis !</l>
     <l n="69">Henceforth he shall be the West-Wind ,</l>
     <l n="70">And hereafter and forever 70</l>
     <l n="71">Shall he hold supreme dominion</l>
     <l n="72">Over all the winds of heaven .</l>
     <l n="73">Call him no more Mudjekeewis ,</l>
     <l n="74">Call him Kabeyun , the West-Wind ! ”</l>
     <l n="75">Thus was Mudjekeewis chosen 75</l>
     <l n="76">Father of the Winds of Heaven .</l>
     <l n="77">For himself he kept the West-Wind ,</l>
     <l n="78">Gave the others to his children ;</l>
     <l n="79">Unto Wabun gave the East-Wind ,</l>
     <l n="80">Gave the South to Shawondasee , 80</l>
     <l n="81">And the North-Wind , wild and cruel ,</l>
     <l n="82">To the fierce Kabibonokka .</l>
     <l n="83">Young and beautiful was Wabun ;</l>
     <l n="84">He it was who brought the morning ,</l>
     <l n="85">He it was whose silver arrows 85</l>
     <l n="86">Chased the dark o'er hill and valley ;</l>
     <l n="87">He it was whose cheeks were painted</l>
     <l n="88">With the brightest streaks of crimson ,</l>
     <l n="89">And whose voice awoke the village ,</l>
     <l n="90">Called the deer , and called the hunter . 90</l>
     <l n="91">Lonely in the sky was Wabun ;</l>
     <l n="92">Though the birds sang gayly to him ,</l>
     <l n="93">Though the wild-flowers of the meadow</l>
     <l n="94">Filled the air with odors for him ,</l>
     <l n="95">Though the forests and the rivers 95</l>
     <l n="96">Sang and shouted at his coming ,</l>
     <l n="97">Still his heart was sad within him ,</l>
     <l n="98">For he was alone in heaven .</l>
     <l n="99">But one morning , gazing earthward ,</l>
     <l n="100">While the village still was sleeping , 100</l>
     <l n="101">And the fog lay on the river ,</l>
     <l n="102">Like a ghost , that goes at sunrise ,</l>
     <l n="103">He beheld a maiden walking</l>
     <l n="104">All alone upon a meadow ,</l>
     <l n="105">Gathering water-flags and rushes 105</l>
     <l n="106">By a river in the meadow .</l>
     <l n="107">Every morning , gazing earthward ,</l>
     <l n="108">Still the first thing he beheld there</l>
     <l n="109">Was her blue eyes looking at him ,</l>
     <l n="110">Two blue lakes among the rushes . 110</l>
     <l n="111">And he loved the lonely maiden ,</l>
     <l n="112">Who thus waited for his coming ;</l>
     <l n="113">For they both were solitary ,</l>
     <l n="114">She on earth and he in heaven .</l>
     <l n="115">And he wooed her with caresses , 115</l>
     <l n="116">Wooed her with his smile of sunshine ,</l>
     <l n="117">With his flattering words he wooed her ,</l>
     <l n="118">With his sighing and his singing ,</l>
     <l n="119">Gentlest whispers in the branches ,</l>
     <l n="120">Softest music , sweetest odors , 120</l>
     <l n="121">Till he drew her to his bosom ,</l>
     <l n="122">Folded in his robes of crimson ,</l>
     <l n="123">Till into a star he changed her ,</l>
     <l n="124">Trembling still upon his bosom ;</l>
     <l n="125">And forever in the heavens 125</l>
     <l n="126">They are seen together walking ,</l>
     <l n="127">Waban and the Wabun-Annung ,</l>
     <l n="128">Wabun and the Star of Morning .</l>
     <l n="129">But the fierce Kabibonokka</l>
     <l n="130">Had his dwelling among icebergs , 130</l>
     <l n="131">In the everlasting snow-drifts ,</l>
     <l n="132">In the kingdom of Wabasso ,</l>
     <l n="133">In the land of the White Rabbit .</l>
     <l n="134">He it was whose hand in Autumn</l>
     <l n="135">Painted all the trees with scarlet , 135</l>
     <l n="136">Stained the leaves with red and yellow ;</l>
     <l n="137">He it was who sent the snow-flakes ,</l>
     <l n="138">Sifting , hissing through the forest ,</l>
     <l n="139">Froze the ponds , the lakes , the rivers ,</l>
     <l n="140">Drove the loon and sea-gull southward , 140</l>
     <l n="141">Drove the cormorant and curlew</l>
     <l n="142">To their nests of sedge and sea-tang</l>
     <l n="143">In the realms of Shawondasee .</l>
     <l n="144">Once the fierce Kabibonokka</l>
     <l n="145">Issued from his lodge of snow-drifts , 145</l>
     <l n="146">From his home among the icebergs ,</l>
     <l n="147">And his hair , with snow besprinkled ,</l>
     <l n="148">Streamed behind him like a river ,</l>
     <l n="149">Like a black and wintry river ,</l>
     <l n="150">As he howled and hurried southward , 150</l>
     <l n="151">Over frozen lakes and moorlands .</l>
     <l n="152">There among the reeds and rushes</l>
     <l n="153">Found he Shingebis , the diver ,</l>
     <l n="154">Trailing strings of fish behind him ,</l>
     <l n="155">O'er the frozen fens and moorlands , 155</l>
     <l n="156">Lingering still among the moorlands ,</l>
     <l n="157">Though his tribe had long departed</l>
     <l n="158">To the land of Shawondasee .</l>
     <l n="159">Cried the fierce Kabibonokka ,</l>
     <l n="160">“ Who is this that dares to brave me ? 160</l>
     <l n="161">Dares to stay in my dominions ,</l>
     <l n="162">When the Wawa has departed ,</l>
     <l n="163">When the wild-goose has gone southward ,</l>
     <l n="164">And the heron , the Shuh-shuh-gah ,</l>
     <l n="165">Long ago departed southward ? 165</l>
     <l n="166">I will go into his wigwam ,</l>
     <l n="167">I will put his smouldering fire out ! ”</l>
     <l n="168">And at night Kabibonokka</l>
     <l n="169">To the lodge came wild and wailing ,</l>
     <l n="170">Heaped the snow in drifts about it , 170</l>
     <l n="171">Shouted down into the smoke-flue ,</l>
     <l n="172">Shook the lodge-poles in his fury ,</l>
     <l n="173">Flapped the curtain of the door-way .</l>
     <l n="174">Shingebis , the diver , feared not ,</l>
     <l n="175">Shingebis , the diver , cared not ; 175</l>
     <l n="176">Four great logs had he for fire-wood ,</l>
     <l n="177">One for each moon of the winter ,</l>
     <l n="178">And for food the fishes served him .</l>
     <l n="179">By his blazing fire he sat there ,</l>
     <l n="180">Warm and merry , eating , laughing , 180</l>
     <l n="181">Singing , “ O Kabibonokka ,</l>
     <l n="182">You are but my fellow-mortal ! ”</l>

     <l n="183">[ Illustration : “ I have given you streams to fish in . ” ]</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="184">Then Kabibonokka entered ,</l>
     <l n="185">And though Shingebis , the diver ,</l>
     <l n="186">Felt his presence by the coldness , 185</l>
     <l n="187">Felt his icy breath upon him ,</l>
     <l n="188">Still he did not cease his singing ,</l>
     <l n="189">Still he did not leave his laughing ,</l>
     <l n="190">Only turned the log a little ,</l>
     <l n="191">Only made the fire burn brighter , 190</l>
     <l n="192">Made the sparks fly up the smoke-flue .</l>
     <l n="193">From Kabibonokka 's forehead ,</l>
     <l n="194">From his snow-besprinkled tresses ,</l>
     <l n="195">Drops of sweat fell fast and heavy ,</l>
     <l n="196">Making dints upon the ashes , 195</l>
     <l n="197">As along the eaves of lodges ,</l>
     <l n="198">As from drooping boughs of hemlock ,</l>
     <l n="199">Drips the melting snow in spring-time ,</l>
     <l n="200">Making hollows in the snow-drifts .</l>
     <l n="201">Till at last he rose defeated , 200</l>
     <l n="202">Could not bear the heat and laughter ,</l>
     <l n="203">Could not bear the merry singing ,</l>
     <l n="204">But rushed headlong through the door-way ,</l>
     <l n="205">Stamped upon the crusted snow-drifts ,</l>
     <l n="206">Stamped upon the lakes and rivers , 205</l>
     <l n="207">Made the snow upon them harder ,</l>
     <l n="208">Made the ice upon them thicker ,</l>
     <l n="209">Challenged Shingebis , the diver ,</l>
     <l n="210">To come forth and wrestle with him ,</l>
     <l n="211">To come forth and wrestle naked 210</l>
     <l n="212">On the frozen fens and moorlands .</l>
     <l n="213">Forth went Shingebis , the diver ,</l>
     <l n="214">Wrestled all night with the North-Wind ,</l>
     <l n="215">Wrestled naked on the moorlands</l>
     <l n="216">With the fierce Kabibonokka , 215</l>
     <l n="217">Till his panting breath grew fainter ,</l>
     <l n="218">Till his frozen grasp grew feebler ,</l>
     <l n="219">Till he reeled and staggered backward ,</l>
     <l n="220">And retreated , baffled , beaten ,</l>
     <l n="221">To the kingdom of Wabasso , 220</l>
     <l n="222">To the land of the White Rabbit ,</l>
     <l n="223">Hearing still the gusty laughter ,</l>
     <l n="224">Hearing Shingebis , the diver ,</l>
     <l n="225">Singing , “ O Kabibonokka ,</l>
     <l n="226">You are but my fellow-mortal ! ” 225</l>
     <l n="227">Shawondasee , fat and lazy ,—</l>
     <l n="228">Had his dwelling far to southward ,</l>
     <l n="229">In the drowsy , dreamy sunshine ,</l>
     <l n="230">In the never-ending Summer .</l>
     <l n="231">He it was who sent the wood-birds , 230</l>
     <l n="232">Sent the Opechee , the robin ,</l>
     <l n="233">Sent the bluebird , the Owaissa ,</l>
     <l n="234">Sent the Shawshaw , sent the swallow ,</l>
     <l n="235">Sent the wild-goose , Wawa , northward ,</l>
     <l n="236">Sent the melons and tobacco , 235</l>
     <l n="237">And the grapes in purple clusters .</l>
     <l n="238">From his pipe the smoke ascending</l>
     <l n="239">Filled the sky with haze and vapor ,</l>
     <l n="240">Filled the air with dreamy softness ,</l>
     <l n="241">Gave a twinkle to the water . 240</l>
     <l n="242">Touched the rugged hills with smoothness ,</l>
     <l n="243">Brought the tender Indian Summer</l>
     <l n="244">To the melancholy North-land ,</l>
     <l n="245">In the dreary Moon of Snow-shoes .</l>
     <l n="246">Listless , careless Shawondasee ! 245</l>
     <l n="247">In his life he had one shadow ,</l>
     <l n="248">In his heart one sorrow had he .</l>
     <l n="249">Once , as he was gazing northward ,</l>
     <l n="250">Far away upon a prairie</l>
     <l n="251">He beheld a maiden standing , 250</l>
     <l n="252">Saw a tall and slender maiden</l>
     <l n="253">All alone upon a prairie ;</l>
     <l n="254">Brightest green were all her garments ,</l>
     <l n="255">And her hair was like the sunshine .</l>
     <l n="256">Day by day he gazed upon her , 255</l>
     <l n="257">Day by day he sighed with passion ,</l>
     <l n="258">Day by day his heart within him</l>
     <l n="259">Grew more hot with love and longing</l>
     <l n="260">For the maid with yellow tresses .</l>
     <l n="261">But he was too fat and lazy 260</l>
     <l n="262">To bestir himself and woo her ;</l>
     <l n="263">Yes , too indolent and easy</l>
     <l n="264">To pursue her and persuade her .</l>
     <l n="265">So he only gazed upon her ,</l>
     <l n="266">Only sat and sighed with passion 265</l>
     <l n="267">For the maiden of the prairie .</l>
     <l n="268">Till one morning , looking northward ,</l>
     <l n="269">He beheld her yellow tresses</l>
     <l n="270">Changed and covered o'er with whiteness ,</l>
     <l n="271">Covered as with whitest snow-flakes . 270</l>
     <l n="272">“ Ah ! my brother from the North-land ,</l>
     <l n="273">From the kingdom of Wabasso ,</l>
     <l n="274">From the land of the White Rabbit !</l>
     <l n="275">You have stolen the maiden from me ,</l>
     <l n="276">You have laid your hand upon her , 275</l>
     <l n="277">You have wooed and won my maiden ,</l>
     <l n="278">With your stories of the North-land ! ”</l>
     <l n="279">Thus the wretched Shawondasee</l>
     <l n="280">Breathed into the air his sorrow ;</l>
     <l n="281">And the South-Wind o'er the prairie 280</l>
     <l n="282">Wandered warm with sighs of passion ,</l>
     <l n="283">With the sighs of Shawondasee ,</l>
     <l n="284">Till the air seemed full of snow-flakes ,</l>
     <l n="285">Full of thistle-down the prairie ,</l>
     <l n="286">And the maid with hair like sunshine 285</l>
     <l n="287">Vanished from his sight forever ;</l>
     <l n="288">Never more did Shawondasee</l>
     <l n="289">See the maid with yellow tresses !</l>
     <l n="290">Poor , deluded Shawondasee !</l>
     <l n="291">‘ T was no woman that you gazed at , 290</l>
     <l n="292">‘ T was no maiden that you sighed for ,</l>
     <l n="293">‘ T was the prairie dandelion</l>
     <l n="294">That through all the dreamy Summer</l>
     <l n="295">You had gazed at with such longing ,</l>
     <l n="296">You had sighed for with such passion , 295</l>
     <l n="297">And had puffed away forever ,</l>
     <l n="298">Blown into the air with sighing .</l>
     <l n="299">Ah ! deluded Shawondasee !</l>
     <l n="300">Thus the Four Winds were divided ;</l>
     <l n="301">Thus the sons of Mudjekeewis 300</l>
     <l n="302">Had their stations in the heavens ,</l>
     <l n="303">At the corners of the heavens ;</l>
     <l n="304">For himself the West-Wind only</l>
     <l n="305">Kept the mighty Mudjekeewis .</l>

     <l n="1">Downward through the evening twilight ,</l>
     <l n="2">In the days that are forgotten ,</l>
     <l n="3">In the unremembered ages ,</l>
     <l n="4">From the full moon fell Nokomis ,</l>
     <l n="5">Fell the beautiful Nokomis , 5</l>
     <l n="6">She a wife but not a mother .</l>
     <l n="7">She was sporting with her women ,</l>
     <l n="8">Swinging in a swing of grape-vines ,</l>
     <l n="9">When her rival , the rejected ,</l>
     <l n="10">Full of jealousy and hatred , 10</l>
     <l n="11">Cut the leafy swing asunder ,</l>
     <l n="12">Cut in twain the twisted grape-vines ,</l>
     <l n="13">And Nokomis fell affrighted</l>
     <l n="14">Downward through the evening twilight ,</l>
     <l n="15">On the Muskoday , the meadow , 15</l>
     <l n="16">On the prairie full of blossoms .</l>
     <l n="17">“ See ! a star falls ! ” said the people ;</l>
     <l n="18">“ From the sky a star is falling ! ”</l>
     <l n="19">There among the ferns and mosses ,</l>
     <l n="20">There among the prairie lilies , 20</l>
     <l n="21">On the Muskoday , the meadow ,</l>
     <l n="22">In the moonlight and the starlight ,</l>
     <l n="23">Fair Nokomis bore a daughter .</l>
     <l n="24">And she called her name Wenonah ,</l>
     <l n="25">As the first-born of her daughters . 25</l>
     <l n="26">And the daughter of Nokomis</l>
     <l n="27">Grew up like the prairie lilies ,</l>
     <l n="28">Grew a tall and slender maiden ,</l>
     <l n="29">With the beauty of the moonlight ,</l>
     <l n="30">With the beauty of the starlight . 30</l>
     <l n="31">And Nokomis warned her often ,</l>
     <l n="32">Saying oft , and oft repeating ,</l>
     <l n="33">“ Oh , beware of Mudjekeewis ,</l>
     <l n="34">Of the West-Wind , Mudjekeewis ;</l>
     <l n="35">Listen not to what he tells you ; 35</l>
     <l n="36">Lie not down upon the meadow ,</l>
     <l n="37">Stoop not down among the lilies ,</l>
     <l n="38">Lest the West-Wind come and harm you ! ”</l>
     <l n="39">But she heeded not the warning ,</l>
     <l n="40">Heeded not those words of wisdom . 40</l>
     <l n="41">And the West-Wind came at evening ,</l>
     <l n="42">Walking lightly o'er the prairie ,</l>
     <l n="43">Whispering to the leaves and blossoms ,</l>
     <l n="44">Bending low the flowers and grasses ,</l>
     <l n="45">Found the beautiful Wenonah , 45</l>
     <l n="46">Lying there among the lilies ,</l>
     <l n="47">Wooed her with his words of sweetness ,</l>
     <l n="48">Wooed her with his soft caresses ,</l>
     <l n="49">Till she bore a son in sorrow ,</l>
     <l n="50">Bore a son of love and sorrow , 50</l>
     <l n="51">Thus was born my Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="52">Thus was born the child of wonder ;</l>
     <l n="53">But the daughter of Nokomis ,</l>
     <l n="54">Hiawatha 's gentle mother ,</l>
     <l n="55">In her anguish died deserted 55</l>
     <l n="56">By the West-Wind , false and faithless ,</l>
     <l n="57">By the heartless Mudjekeewis .</l>
     <l n="58">For her daughter , long and loudly</l>
     <l n="59">Wailed and wept the sad Nokomis ;</l>
     <l n="60">“ Oh that I were dead ! ” she murmured , 60</l>
     <l n="61">“ Oh that I were dead , as thou art !</l>
     <l n="62">No more work , and no more weeping ,</l>
     <l n="63">Wahonowin ! Wahonowin ! ”</l>
     <l n="64">By the shores of Gitche Gumee ,</l>
     <l n="65">By the shining Big-Sea-Water , 65</l>
     <l n="66">Stood the wigwam of Nokomis</l>
     <l n="67">Daughter of the Moon , Nokomis .</l>
     <l n="68">Dark behind it rose the forest ,</l>
     <l n="69">Rose the black and gloomy pine-trees ,</l>
     <l n="70">Rose the firs with cones upon them ; 70</l>
     <l n="71">Bright before it beat the water ,</l>
     <l n="72">Beat the clear and sunny water ,</l>
     <l n="73">Beat the shining Big-Sea-Water .</l>
     <l n="74">There the wrinkled old Nokomis</l>
     <l n="75">Nursed the little Hiawatha , 75</l>
     <l n="76">Rocked him in his linden cradle ,</l>
     <l n="77">Bedded soft in moss and rushes ,</l>
     <l n="78">Safely bound with reindeer sinews ;</l>
     <l n="79">Stilled his fretful wail by saying ,</l>
     <l n="80">“ Hush ! the Naked Bear will hear thee ! ” 80</l>
     <l n="81">Lulled him into slumber , singing ,</l>
     <l n="82">“ Ewa-yea ! my little owlet !</l>
     <l n="83">Who is this , that lights the wigwam ?</l>
     <l n="84">With his great eyes lights the wigwam ?</l>
     <l n="85">Ewa-yea ! my little owlet ! ” 85</l>
     <l n="86">Many things Nokomis taught him</l>
     <l n="87">Of the stars that shine in heaven ;</l>
     <l n="88">Showed him Ishkoodah , the comet ,</l>
     <l n="89">Ishkoodah , with fiery tresses ;</l>
     <l n="90">Showed the Death-Dance of the spirits , 90</l>
     <l n="91">Warriors with their plumes and war-clubs</l>
     <l n="92">Flaring far away to northward</l>
     <l n="93">In the frosty nights of Winter ;</l>
     <l n="94">Showed the broad white road in heaven ,</l>
     <l n="95">Pathway of the ghosts , the shadows , 95</l>
     <l n="96">Running straight across the heavens ,</l>
     <l n="97">Crowded with the ghosts , the shadows .</l>
     <l n="98">At the door on summer evenings</l>
     <l n="99">Sat the little Hiawatha ;</l>
     <l n="100">Heard the whispering of the pine-trees , 100</l>
     <l n="101">Heard the lapping of the waters ,</l>
     <l n="102">Sounds of music , words of wonder ;</l>
     <l n="103">“ Minne-wawa ! ” said the pine-trees .</l>
     <l n="104">“ Mudway-aushka ! ” said the water .</l>
     <l n="105">Saw the fire-fly , Wah-wah-taysee , 105</l>
     <l n="106">Flitting through the dusk of evening ,</l>
     <l n="107">With the twinkle of its candle</l>
     <l n="108">Lighting up the brakes and bushes ,</l>
     <l n="109">And he sang the song of children ,</l>
     <l n="110">Sang the song Nokomis taught him : 110</l>
     <l n="111">“ Wah-wah-taysee , little fire-fly ,</l>
     <l n="112">Little , flitting , white-fire insect ,</l>
     <l n="113">Little , dancing , white-fire creature ,</l>
     <l n="114">Light me with your little candle ,</l>
     <l n="115">Ere upon my bed I lay me , 115</l>
     <l n="116">Ere in sleep I close my eyelids ! ”</l>
     <l n="117">Saw the moon rise from the water</l>
     <l n="118">Rippling , rounding from the water ,</l>
     <l n="119">Saw the flecks and shadows on it ,</l>
     <l n="120">Whispered , “ What is that , Nokomis ? ” 120</l>
     <l n="121">And the good Nokomis answered :</l>
     <l n="122">“ Once a warrior , very angry ,</l>
     <l n="123">Seized his grandmother , and threw her</l>
     <l n="124">Up into the sky at midnight ;</l>
     <l n="125">Right against the moon he threw her ; 125</l>
     <l n="126">‘ T is her body that you see there . ”</l>
     <l n="127">Saw the rainbow in the heaven ,</l>
     <l n="128">In the eastern sky , the rainbow ,</l>
     <l n="129">Whispered , “ What is that , Nokomis ? ”</l>
     <l n="130">And the good Nokomis answered : 130</l>
     <l n="131">“ ‘ T is the heaven of flowers you see there ;</l>
     <l n="132">All the wild-flowers of the forest ,</l>
     <l n="133">All the lilies of the prairie ,</l>
     <l n="134">When on earth they fade and perish ,</l>
     <l n="135">Blossom in that heaven above us . ” 135</l>
     <l n="136">When he heard the owls at midnight ,</l>
     <l n="137">Hooting , laughing in the forest ,</l>
     <l n="138">“ What is that ? ” he cried in terror ;</l>
     <l n="139">“ What is that , ” he said , “ Nokomis ? ”</l>
     <l n="140">And the good Nokomis answered : 140</l>
     <l n="141">“ That is but the owl and owlet ,</l>
     <l n="142">Talking in their native language ,</l>
     <l n="143">Talking , scolding at each other . ”</l>
     <l n="144">Then the little Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="145">Learned of every bird its language , 145</l>
     <l n="146">Learned their names and all their secrets ,</l>
     <l n="147">How they built their nests in Summer ,</l>
     <l n="148">Where they hid themselves in Winter ,</l>
     <l n="149">Talked with them whene'er he met them ,</l>
     <l n="150">Called them “ Hiawatha 's Chickens . ” 150</l>
     <l n="151">Of all beasts he learned the language ,</l>
     <l n="152">Learned their names and all their secrets ,</l>
     <l n="153">How the beavers built their lodges ,</l>
     <l n="154">Where the squirrels hid their acorns ,</l>
     <l n="155">How the reindeer ran so swiftly , 155</l>
     <l n="156">Why the rabbit was so timid ,</l>
     <l n="157">Talked with them whene'er he met them ,</l>
     <l n="158">Called them “ Hiawatha 's Brothers . ”</l>
     <l n="159">Then Iagoo , the great boaster ,</l>
     <l n="160">He the marvellous story-teller , 160</l>
     <l n="161">He the traveller and the talker ,</l>
     <l n="162">He the friend of old Nokomis ,</l>
     <l n="163">Made a bow for Hiawatha ;</l>
     <l n="164">From a branch of ash he made it ,</l>
     <l n="165">From an oak-bough made the arrows , 165</l>
     <l n="166">Tipped with flint , and winged with feathers ,</l>
     <l n="167">And the cord he made of deer-skin .</l>
     <l n="168">Then he said to Hiawatha :</l>
     <l n="169">“ Go , my son , into the forest ,</l>
     <l n="170">Where the red deer herd together , 170</l>
     <l n="171">Kill for us a famous roebuck ,</l>
     <l n="172">Kill for us a deer with antlers ! ”</l>
     <l n="173">Forth into the forest straightway</l>
     <l n="174">All alone walked Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="175">Proudly , with his bow and arrows ; 175</l>
     <l n="176">And the birds sang round him , o'er him ,</l>
     <l n="177">“ Do not shoot us , Hiawatha ! ”</l>
     <l n="178">Sang the Opechee , the robin ,</l>
     <l n="179">Sang the bluebird , the Owaissa ,</l>
     <l n="180">“ Do not shoot us , Hiawatha ! ” 180</l>
     <l n="181">Up the oak-tree , close beside him ,</l>
     <l n="182">Sprang the squirrel , Adjidaumo ,</l>
     <l n="183">In and out among the branches ,</l>
     <l n="184">Coughed and chattered from the oak-tree ,</l>
     <l n="185">Laughed , and said between his laughing , 185</l>
     <l n="186">“ Do not shoot me , Hiawatha ! ”</l>
     <l n="187">And the rabbit from his pathway</l>
     <l n="188">Leaped aside , and at a distance</l>
     <l n="189">Sat erect upon his haunches ,</l>
     <l n="190">Half in fear and half in frolic , 190</l>
     <l n="191">Saying to the little hunter ,</l>
     <l n="192">“ Do not shoot me , Hiawatha ! ”</l>
     <l n="193">But he heeded not , nor heard them ,</l>
     <l n="194">For his thoughts were with the red deer ;</l>
     <l n="195">On their tracks his eyes were fastened , 195</l>
     <l n="196">Leading downward to the river ,</l>
     <l n="197">To the ford across the river ,</l>
     <l n="198">And as one in slumber walked he .</l>
     <l n="199">Hidden in the alder-bushes ,</l>
     <l n="200">There he waited till the deer came , 200</l>
     <l n="201">Till he saw two antlers lifted ,</l>
     <l n="202">Saw two eyes look from the thicket ,</l>
     <l n="203">Saw two nostrils point to windward ,</l>
     <l n="204">And a deer came down the pathway ,</l>
     <l n="205">Flecked with leafy light and shadow . 205</l>
     <l n="206">And his heart within him fluttered ,</l>
     <l n="207">Trembled like the leaves above him ,</l>
     <l n="208">Like the birch-leaf palpitated ,</l>
     <l n="209">As the deer came down the pathway .</l>
     <l n="210">Then , upon one knee uprising , 210</l>
     <l n="211">Hiawatha aimed an arrow ;</l>
     <l n="212">Scarce a twig moved with his motion ,</l>
     <l n="213">Scarce a leaf was stirred or rustled ,</l>
     <l n="214">But the wary roebuck started ,</l>
     <l n="215">Stamped with all his hoofs together , 215</l>
     <l n="216">Listened with one foot uplifted ,</l>
     <l n="217">Leaped as if to meet the arrow ;</l>
     <l n="218">Ah ! the singing , fatal arrow ;</l>
     <l n="219">Like a wasp it buzzed and stung him !</l>
     <l n="220">Dead he lay there in the forest , 220</l>
     <l n="221">By the ford across the river ;</l>
     <l n="222">Beat his timid heart no longer ,</l>
     <l n="223">But the heart of Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="224">Throbbed and shouted and exulted ,</l>
     <l n="225">As he bore the red deer homeward , 225</l>
     <l n="226">And Iagoo and Nokomis</l>
     <l n="227">Hailed his coming with applauses .</l>
     <l n="228">From the red deer 's hide Nokomis</l>
     <l n="229">Made a cloak for Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="230">From the red deer 's flesh Nokomis 230</l>
     <l n="231">Made a banquet in his honor .</l>
     <l n="232">All the village came and feasted ,</l>
     <l n="233">All the guests praised Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="234">Called him Strong-Heart , Soan-ge-taha !</l>
     <l n="235">Called him Loon-Heart , Mahn-go-taysee !</l>

    <head>HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Out of childhood into manhood</l>
     <l n="2">Now had grown my Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="3">Skilled in all the craft of hunters ,</l>
     <l n="4">Learned in all the lore of old men ,</l>
     <l n="5">In all youthful sports and pastimes , 5</l>
     <l n="6">In all manly arts and labors .</l>
     <l n="7">Swift of foot was Hiawatha ;</l>
     <l n="8">He could shoot an arrow from him ,</l>
     <l n="9">And run forward with such fleetness ,</l>
     <l n="10">That the arrow fell behind him ! 10</l>
     <l n="11">Strong of arm was Hiawatha ;</l>
     <l n="12">He could shoot ten arrows upward ,</l>
     <l n="13">Shoot them with such strength and swiftness ,</l>
     <l n="14">That the tenth had left the bow-string</l>
     <l n="15">Ere the first to earth had fallen ! 15</l>
     <l n="16">He had mittens , Minjekahwun ,</l>
     <l n="17">Magic mittens made of deer-skin ;</l>
     <l n="18">When upon his hands he wore them ,</l>
     <l n="19">He could smite the rocks asunder ,</l>
     <l n="20">He could grind them into powder . 20</l>
     <l n="21">He had moccasins enchanted ,</l>
     <l n="22">Magic moccasins of deer-skin ;</l>
     <l n="23">When he bound them round his ankles ,</l>
     <l n="24">When upon his feet he tied them ,</l>
     <l n="25">At each stride a mile he measured ! 25</l>
     <l n="26">Much he questioned old Nokomis</l>
     <l n="27">Of his father Mudjekeewis ;</l>
     <l n="28">Learned from her the fatal secret</l>
     <l n="29">Of the beauty of his mother ,</l>
     <l n="30">Of the falsehood of his father ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">And his heart was hot within him ,</l>
     <l n="32">Like a living coal his heart was .</l>
     <l n="33">Then he said to old Nokomis ,</l>
     <l n="34">“ I will go to Mudjekeewis ,</l>
     <l n="35">See how fares it with my father , 35</l>
     <l n="36">At the doorways of the West-Wind ,</l>
     <l n="37">At the portals of the Sunset ! ”</l>
     <l n="38">From his lodge went Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="39">Dressed for travel , armed for hunting ;</l>
     <l n="40">Dressed in deer-skin shirt and leggings , 40</l>
     <l n="41">Richly wrought with quills and wampum</l>
     <l n="42">On his head his eagle-feathers ,</l>
     <l n="43">Round his waist his belt of wampum ,</l>
     <l n="44">In his hand his bow of ash-wood ,</l>
     <l n="45">Strung with sinews of the reindeer ; 45</l>
     <l n="46">In his quiver oaken arrows ,</l>
     <l n="47">Tipped with jasper , winged with feathers ;</l>
     <l n="48">With his mittens , Minjekahwun ,</l>
     <l n="49">With his moccasins enchanted .</l>
     <l n="50">Warning said the old Nokomis , 50</l>
     <l n="51">“ Go not forth , O Hiawatha !</l>
     <l n="52">To the kingdom of the West-Wind ,</l>
     <l n="53">To the realms of Mudjekeewis ,</l>
     <l n="54">Lest he harm you with his magic ,</l>
     <l n="55">Lest he kill you with his cunning ! ” 55</l>
     <l n="56">But the fearless Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="57">Heeded not her woman 's warning ;</l>
     <l n="58">Forth he strode into the forest ,</l>
     <l n="59">At each stride a mile he measured ;</l>
     <l n="60">Lurid seemed the sky above him , 60</l>
     <l n="61">Lurid seemed the earth beneath him ,</l>
     <l n="62">Hot and close the air around him ,</l>
     <l n="63">Filled with smoke and fiery vapors ,</l>
     <l n="64">As of burning woods and prairies .</l>
     <l n="65">For his heart was hot within him , 65</l>
     <l n="66">Like a living coal his heart was .</l>
     <l n="67">So he journeyed westward , westward ,</l>
     <l n="68">Left the fleetest deer behind him ,</l>
     <l n="69">Left the antelope and bison ;</l>
     <l n="70">Crossed the rushing Esconaba , 70</l>
     <l n="71">Crossed the mighty Mississippi ,</l>
     <l n="72">Passed the Mountains of the Prairie ,</l>
     <l n="73">Passed the land of Crows and Foxes ,</l>
     <l n="74">Passed the dwellings of the Blackfeet ,</l>
     <l n="75">Came unto the Rocky Mountains , 75</l>
     <l n="76">To the kingdom of the West-Wind ,</l>
     <l n="77">Where upon the gusty summits</l>
     <l n="78">Sat the ancient Mudjekeewis ,</l>
     <l n="79">Ruler of the winds of heaven .</l>
     <l n="80">Filled with awe was Hiawatha 80</l>
     <l n="81">At the aspect of his father .</l>
     <l n="82">On the air about him wildly</l>
     <l n="83">Tossed and streamed his cloudy tresses ,</l>
     <l n="84">Gleamed like drifting snow his tresses ,</l>
     <l n="85">Glared like Ishkoodah , the comet , 85</l>
     <l n="86">Like the star with fiery tresses .</l>
     <l n="87">Filled with joy was Mudjekeewis</l>
     <l n="88">When he looked on Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="89">Saw his youth rise up before him</l>
     <l n="90">In the face of Hiawatha , 90</l>
     <l n="91">Saw the beauty of Wenonah</l>
     <l n="92">From the grave rise up before him .</l>
     <l n="93">“ Welcome ! ” said he , “ Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="94">To the kingdom of the West-Wind !</l>
     <l n="95">Long have I been waiting for you ! 95</l>
     <l n="96">Youth is lovely , age is lonely ,</l>
     <l n="97">Youth is fiery , age is frosty ;</l>
     <l n="98">You bring back the days departed ,</l>
     <l n="99">You bring back my youth of passion ,</l>
     <l n="100">And the beautiful Wenonah ! ” 100</l>
     <l n="101">Many days they talked together ,</l>
     <l n="102">Questioned , listened , waited , answered ;</l>
     <l n="103">Much the mighty Mudjekeewis</l>
     <l n="104">Boasted of his ancient prowess ,</l>
     <l n="105">Of his perilous adventures , 105</l>
     <l n="106">His indomitable courage ,</l>
     <l n="107">His invulnerable body .</l>
     <l n="108">Patiently sat Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="109">Listening to his father 's boasting ;</l>
     <l n="110">With a smile he sat and listened , 110</l>
     <l n="111">Uttered neither threat nor menace ,</l>
     <l n="112">Neither word nor look betrayed him ,</l>
     <l n="113">But his heart was hot within him ,</l>
     <l n="114">Like a living coal his heart was .</l>
     <l n="115">Then he said , “ O Mudjekeewis , 115</l>
     <l n="116">Is there nothing that can harm you ?</l>
     <l n="117">Nothing that you are afraid of ? ”</l>
     <l n="118">And the mighty Mudjekeewis ,</l>
     <l n="119">Grand and gracious in his boasting ,</l>
     <l n="120">Answered , saying , “ There is nothing , 120</l>
     <l n="121">Nothing but the black rock yonder ,</l>
     <l n="122">Nothing but the fatal Wawbeek ! ”</l>
     <l n="123">And he looked at Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="124">With a wise look and benignant ,</l>
     <l n="125">With a countenance paternal , 125</l>
     <l n="126">Looked with pride upon the beauty</l>
     <l n="127">Of his tall and graceful figure ,</l>
     <l n="128">Saying , “ O my Hiawatha !</l>
     <l n="129">Is there anything can harm you ?</l>
     <l n="130">Anything you are afraid of ? ” 130</l>
     <l n="131">But the wary Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="132">Paused awhile , as if uncertain ,</l>
     <l n="133">Held his peace , as if resolving ,</l>
     <l n="134">And then answered , “ There is nothing ,</l>
     <l n="135">Nothing but the bulrush yonder , 135</l>
     <l n="136">Nothing but the great Apukwa ! ”</l>
     <l n="137">And as Mudjekeewis , rising ,</l>
     <l n="138">Stretched his hand to pluck the bulrush ,</l>
     <l n="139">Hiawatha cried in terror ,</l>
     <l n="140">Cried in well-dissembled terror , 140</l>
     <l n="141">“ Kago ! kago ! do not touch it ! ”</l>
     <l n="142">“ Ah , kaween ! ” said Mudjekeewis ,</l>
     <l n="143">“ No indeed , I will not touch it ! ”</l>
     <l n="144">Then they talked of other matters ;</l>
     <l n="145">First of Hiawatha 's brothers , 145</l>
     <l n="146">First of Wabun , of the East-Wind ,</l>
     <l n="147">Of the South-Wind , Shawondasee ,</l>
     <l n="148">Of the North , Kabibonokka ;</l>
     <l n="149">Then of Hiawatha 's mother ,</l>
     <l n="150">Of the beautiful Wenonah , 150</l>
     <l n="151">Of her birth upon the meadow ,</l>
     <l n="152">Of her death , as old Nokomis</l>
     <l n="153">Had remembered and related .</l>
     <l n="154">And he cried , “ O Mudjekeewis ,</l>
     <l n="155">It was you who killed Wenonah , 155</l>
     <l n="156">Took her young life and her beauty ,</l>
     <l n="157">Broke the Lily of the Prairie ,</l>
     <l n="158">Trampled it beneath your footsteps ;</l>
     <l n="159">You confess it ! you confess it ! ”</l>
     <l n="160">And the mighty Mudjekeewis 160</l>
     <l n="161">Tossed his gray hairs to the West-Wind ,</l>
     <l n="162">Bowed his hoary head in anguish ,</l>
     <l n="163">With a silent nod assented .</l>

     <l n="167">Then up started Hiawatha ,</l>

     <l n="183">Seized the bulrush , the Apukwa , 180</l>

     <l n="187">Long and loud laughed Hiawatha !</l>
     <l n="188">Then began the deadly conflict , 185</l>
     <l n="189">Hand to hand among the mountains ;</l>
     <l n="190">From his eyry screamed the eagle ,</l>
     <l n="191">The Keneu , the great war-eagle ,</l>
     <l n="192">Sat upon the crags around them ,</l>
     <l n="193">Wheeling flapped his wings above them . 190</l>
     <l n="194">Like a tall tree in the tempest</l>
     <l n="195">Bent and lashed the giant bulrush ;</l>

     <l n="199">And confusion of the battle ,</l>
     <l n="200">And the air was full of shoutings ,</l>
     <l n="201">And the thunder of the mountains ,</l>
     <l n="202">Starting , answered , “ Baim-wawa ! ”</l>
     <l n="203">Back retreated Mudjekeewis , 200</l>
     <l n="204">Rushing westward o'er the mountains ,</l>
     <l n="205">Stumbling westward down the mountains</l>
     <l n="206">Three whole days retreated fighting ,</l>
     <l n="207">Still pursued by Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="208">To the doorways of the West-Wind , 205</l>
     <l n="209">To the portals of the Sunset ,</l>

     <l n="214">In the melancholy marshes .</l>

     <l n="241">In the kingdom of the West-Wind .</l>

     <l n="249">Pleasant was the landscape round him ,</l>
     <l n="250">Pleasant was the air above him ,</l>
     <l n="251">For the bitterness of anger</l>
     <l n="252">Had departed wholly from him ,</l>
     <l n="253">From his brain the thought of vengeance , 250</l>
     <l n="254">From his heart the burning fever .</l>
     <l n="255">Only once his pace he slackened ,</l>
     <l n="256">Only once he paused or halted ,</l>
     <l n="257">Paused to purchase heads of arrows</l>
     <l n="258">Of the ancient Arrow-maker , 255</l>
     <l n="259">In the land of the Dacotahs ,</l>
     <l n="260">Where the Falls of Minnehaha</l>
     <l n="261">Flash and gleam among the oak-trees ,</l>
     <l n="262">Laugh and leap into the valley .</l>
     <l n="263">There the ancient Arrow-maker 260</l>
     <l n="264">Made his arrow-heads of sandstone ,</l>
     <l n="265">Arrow-heads of chalcedony ,</l>
     <l n="266">Arrow-heads of flint and jasper ,</l>
     <l n="267">Smoothed and sharpened at the edges ,</l>
     <l n="268">Hard and polished , keen and costly . 265</l>
     <l n="269">With him dwelt his dark-eyed daughter ,</l>
     <l n="270">Wayward as the Minnehaha ,</l>
     <l n="271">With her moods of shade and sunshine ,</l>
     <l n="272">Eyes that smiled and frowned alternate ,</l>
     <l n="273">Feet as rapid as the river , 270</l>
     <l n="274">Tresses flowing like the water ,</l>
     <l n="275">And as musical a laughter ;</l>
     <l n="276">And he named her from the river ,</l>
     <l n="277">From the water-fall he named her ,</l>
     <l n="278">Minnehaha , Laughing Water . 275</l>
     <l n="279">Was it then for heads of arrows ,</l>
     <l n="280">Arrow-heads of chalcedony ,</l>
     <l n="281">Arrow-heads of flint and jasper ,</l>
     <l n="282">That my Hiawatha halted</l>
     <l n="283">In the land of the Dacotahs ? 280</l>
     <l n="284">Was it not to see the maiden ,</l>
     <l n="285">See the face of Laughing Water</l>
     <l n="286">Peeping from behind the curtain ,</l>
     <l n="287">Hear the rustling of her garments</l>
     <l n="288">From behind the waving curtain , 285</l>
     <l n="289">As one sees the Minnehaha</l>
     <l n="290">Gleaming , glancing through the branches ,</l>
     <l n="291">As one hears the Laughing Water</l>
     <l n="292">From behind its screen of branches ?</l>
     <l n="293">Who shall say what thoughts and visions 290</l>
     <l n="294">Fill the fiery brains of young men ?</l>
     <l n="295">Who shall say what dreams of beauty</l>
     <l n="296">Filled the heart of Hiawatha ?</l>
     <l n="297">All he told to old Nokomis ,</l>
     <l n="298">When he reached the lodge at sunset , 295</l>
     <l n="299">Was the meeting with his father ,</l>
     <l n="300">Was his fight with Mudjekeewis ;</l>
     <l n="301">Not a word he said of arrows ,</l>

    <head>HIAWATHA 'S FASTING .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">You shall hear how Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="2">Prayed and fasted in the forest ,</l>
     <l n="3">Not for greater skill in hunting ,</l>
     <l n="4">Not for greater craft in fishing ,</l>
     <l n="5">Not for triumphs in the battle , 5</l>
     <l n="6">And renown among the warriors ,</l>
     <l n="7">But for profit of the people ,</l>
     <l n="8">For advantage of the nations .</l>
     <l n="9">First he built a lodge for fasting ,</l>
     <l n="10">Built a wigwam in the forest , 10</l>
     <l n="11">By the shining Big-Sea-Water ,</l>
     <l n="12">In the blithe and pleasant Spring-time ,</l>
     <l n="13">In the Moon of Leaves he built it ,</l>
     <l n="14">And , with dreams and visions many ,</l>
     <l n="15">Seven whole days and nights he fasted . 15</l>
     <l n="16">On the first day of his fasting</l>
     <l n="17">Through the leafy woods he wandered ;</l>
     <l n="18">Saw the deer start from the thicket ,</l>
     <l n="19">Saw the rabbit in his burrow ,</l>
     <l n="20">Heard the pheasant , Bena , drumming , 20</l>
     <l n="21">Heard the squirrel , Adjidaumo ,</l>
     <l n="22">Rattling in his hoard of acorns ,</l>
     <l n="23">Saw the pigeon , the Omeme ,</l>
     <l n="24">Building nests among the pine-trees ,</l>
     <l n="25">And in flocks the wild goose , Wawa , 25</l>
     <l n="26">Flying to the fen-lands northward ,</l>
     <l n="27">Whirring , wailing far above him .</l>
     <l n="28">“ Master of Life ! ” he cried , desponding ,</l>
     <l n="29">“ Must our lives depend on these things ? ”</l>
     <l n="30">On the next day of his fasting 30</l>
     <l n="31">By the river 's brink he wandered ,</l>
     <l n="32">Through the Muskoday , the meadow ,</l>
     <l n="33">Saw the wild rice , Mahnomonee ,</l>
     <l n="34">Saw the blueberry , Meenahga ,</l>
     <l n="35">And the strawberry , Odahmin , 35</l>
     <l n="36">And the gooseberry , Shahbomin ,</l>
     <l n="37">And the grape-vine , the Bemahgut ,</l>
     <l n="38">Trailing o'er the alder-branches ,</l>
     <l n="39">Filling all the air with fragrance !</l>
     <l n="40">“ Master of Life ! ” he cried , desponding , 40</l>
     <l n="41">“ Must our lives depend on these things ? ”</l>
     <l n="42">On the third day of his fasting</l>
     <l n="43">By the lake he sat and pondered ,</l>
     <l n="44">By the still , transparent water ;</l>
     <l n="45">Saw the sturgeon , Nahma , leaping , 45</l>
     <l n="46">Scattering drops like beads of wampum ,</l>
     <l n="47">Saw the yellow perch , the Sahwa ,</l>
     <l n="48">Like a sunbeam in the water ,</l>
     <l n="49">Saw the pike , the Maskenozha ,</l>
     <l n="50">And the herring , Okahahwis , 50</l>
     <l n="51">And the Shawgashee , the craw-fish !</l>
     <l n="52">“ Master of Life ! ” he cried , desponding ,</l>
     <l n="53">“ Must our lives depend on these things ? ”</l>
     <l n="54">On the fourth day of his fasting</l>
     <l n="55">In his lodge he lay exhausted ; 55</l>
     <l n="56">From his couch of leaves and branches</l>
     <l n="57">Gazing with half-open eyelids ,</l>
     <l n="58">Full of shadowy dreams and visions ,</l>
     <l n="59">On the dizzy , swimming landscape ,</l>
     <l n="60">On the gleaming of the water , 60</l>
     <l n="61">On the splendor of the sunset .</l>
     <l n="62">And he saw a youth approaching ,</l>
     <l n="63">Dressed in garments green and yellow ,</l>
     <l n="64">Coming through the purple twilight ,</l>
     <l n="65">Through the splendor of the sunset ; 65</l>
     <l n="66">Plumes of green bent o'er his forehead ,</l>
     <l n="67">And his hair was soft and golden .</l>
     <l n="68">Standing at the open doorway ,</l>
     <l n="69">Long he looked at Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="70">Looked with pity and compassion 70</l>
     <l n="71">On his wasted form and features ,</l>
     <l n="72">And , in accents like the sighing</l>
     <l n="73">Of the South-Wind in the tree-tops ,</l>
     <l n="74">Said he , “ O my Hiawatha !</l>
     <l n="75">All your prayers are heard in heaven , 75</l>
     <l n="76">For you pray not like the others ;</l>
     <l n="77">Not for greater skill in hunting ,</l>
     <l n="78">Not for greater craft in fishing ,</l>
     <l n="79">Not for triumph in the battle ,</l>
     <l n="80">Nor renown among the warriors , 80</l>
     <l n="81">But for profit of the people ,</l>
     <l n="82">For advantage of the nations .</l>
     <l n="83">“ From the Master of Life descending ,</l>
     <l n="84">I , the friend of man , Mondamin ,</l>
     <l n="85">Come to warn you and instruct you , 85</l>
     <l n="86">How by struggle and by labor</l>
     <l n="87">You shall gain what you have prayed for .</l>
     <l n="88">Rise up from your bed of branches ,</l>
     <l n="89">Rise , O youth , and wrestle with me ! ”</l>
     <l n="90">Faint with famine , Hiawatha 90</l>
     <l n="91">Started from his bed of branches ,</l>
     <l n="92">From the twilight of his wigwam</l>
     <l n="93">Forth into the flush of sunset</l>
     <l n="94">Came , and wrestled with Mondamin ;</l>
     <l n="95">At his touch he felt new courage 95</l>
     <l n="96">Throbbing in his brain and bosom ,</l>
     <l n="97">Felt new life and hope and vigor</l>
     <l n="98">Run through every nerve and fibre .</l>
     <l n="99">So they wrestled there together</l>
     <l n="100">In the glory of the sunset , 100</l>
     <l n="101">And the more they strove and struggled ,</l>
     <l n="102">Stronger still grew Hiawatha ;</l>
     <l n="103">Till the darkness fell around them ,</l>
     <l n="104">And the heron , the Shuh-shuh-gah ,</l>
     <l n="105">From her haunts among the fen-lands , 105</l>
     <l n="106">Gave a cry of lamentation ,</l>
     <l n="107">Gave a scream of pain and famine .</l>
     <l n="108">“ ‘ T is enough ! ” then said Mondamin ,</l>
     <l n="109">Smiling upon Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="110">“ But tomorrow , when the sun sets , 110</l>
     <l n="111">I will come again to try you . ”</l>
     <l n="112">And he vanished , and was seen not ;</l>
     <l n="113">Whether sinking as the rain sinks ,</l>
     <l n="114">Whether rising as the mists rise ,</l>
     <l n="115">Hiawatha saw not , knew not , 115</l>
     <l n="116">Only saw that he had vanished ,</l>
     <l n="117">Leaving him alone and fainting ,</l>
     <l n="118">With the misty lake below him ,</l>
     <l n="119">And the reeling stars above him .</l>
     <l n="120">On the morrow and the next day , 120</l>
     <l n="121">When the sun through heaven descending ,</l>
     <l n="122">Like a red and burning cinder</l>
     <l n="123">From the hearth of the Great Spirit ,</l>
     <l n="124">Fell into the western waters ,</l>
     <l n="125">Came Mondamin for the trial , 125</l>
     <l n="126">For the strife with Hiawatha ;</l>
     <l n="127">Came as silent as the dew comes ,</l>
     <l n="128">From the empty air appearing ,</l>
     <l n="129">Into empty air returning ,</l>
     <l n="130">Taking shape when earth it touches 130</l>
     <l n="131">But invisible to all men</l>
     <l n="132">In its coming and its going .</l>
     <l n="133">Thrice they wrestled there together</l>
     <l n="134">In the glory of the sunset ,</l>
     <l n="135">Till the darkness fell around them , 135</l>
     <l n="136">Till the heron , the Shuh-shuh-gah ,</l>
     <l n="137">From her haunts among the fen-lands ,</l>
     <l n="138">Uttered her loud cry of famine ,</l>
     <l n="139">And Mondamin paused to listen .</l>
     <l n="140">Tall and beautiful he stood there , 140</l>
     <l n="141">In his garments green and yellow ;</l>
     <l n="142">To and fro his plumes above him</l>
     <l n="143">Waved and nodded with his breathing ,</l>
     <l n="144">And the sweat of the encounter</l>
     <l n="145">Stood like drops of dew upon him . 145</l>
     <l n="146">And he cried , “ O Hiawatha !</l>
     <l n="147">Bravely have you wrestled with me ,</l>
     <l n="148">Thrice have wrestled stoutly with me ,</l>
     <l n="149">And the Master of Life , who sees us ,</l>
     <l n="150">He will give to you the triumph ! ” 150</l>
     <l n="151">Then he smiled and said : “ To-morrow</l>
     <l n="152">Is the last day of your conflict ,</l>
     <l n="153">Is the last day of your fasting .</l>
     <l n="154">You will conquer and o'ercome me ;</l>
     <l n="155">Make a bed for me to lie in , 155</l>
     <l n="156">Where the rain may fall upon me ,</l>
     <l n="157">Where the sun may come and warm me ;</l>
     <l n="158">Strip these garments , green and yellow ,</l>
     <l n="159">Strip this nodding plumage from me ,</l>
     <l n="160">Lay me in the earth and make it 160</l>
     <l n="161">Soft and loose and light above me .</l>
     <l n="162">“ Let no hand disturb my slumber ,</l>
     <l n="163">Let no weed nor worm molest me ,</l>
     <l n="164">Let not Kahgahgee , the raven ,</l>
     <l n="165">Come to haunt me and molest me , 165</l>
     <l n="166">Only come yourself to watch me ,</l>
     <l n="167">Till I wake , and start , and quicken ,</l>
     <l n="168">Till I leap into the sunshine . ”</l>
     <l n="169">And thus saying , he departed ;</l>
     <l n="170">Peacefully slept Hiawatha , 170</l>
     <l n="171">But he heard the Wawonaissa ,</l>
     <l n="172">Heard the whippoorwill complaining ,</l>
     <l n="173">Perched upon his lonely wigwam ;</l>
     <l n="174">Heard the rushing Sebowisha ,</l>
     <l n="175">Heard the rivulet rippling near him , 175</l>
     <l n="176">Talking to the darksome forest ;</l>
     <l n="177">Heard the sighing of the branches ,</l>
     <l n="178">As they lifted and subsided</l>
     <l n="179">At the passing of the night-wind ,</l>
     <l n="180">Heard them , as one hears in slumber 180</l>
     <l n="181">Far-off murmurs , dreamy whispers :</l>
     <l n="182">Peacefully slept Hiawatha .</l>
     <l n="183">On the morrow came Nokomis ,</l>
     <l n="184">On the seventh day of his fasting ,</l>
     <l n="185">Came with food for Hiawatha , 185</l>
     <l n="186">Came imploring and bewailing ,</l>
     <l n="187">Lest his hunger should o'ercome him ,</l>
     <l n="188">Lest his fasting should be fatal .</l>
     <l n="189">But he tasted not , and touched not ,</l>
     <l n="190">Only said to her , “ Nokomis , 190</l>
     <l n="191">Wait until the sun is setting ,</l>
     <l n="192">Till the darkness falls around us ,</l>
     <l n="193">Till the heron , the Shuh-shuh-gah ,</l>
     <l n="194">Crying from the desolate marshes ,</l>
     <l n="195">Tells us that the day is ended . ” 195</l>
     <l n="196">Homeward weeping went Nokomis ,</l>
     <l n="197">Sorrowing for her Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="198">Fearing lest his strength should fail him ,</l>
     <l n="199">Lest his fasting should be fatal .</l>
     <l n="200">He meanwhile sat weary waiting 200</l>
     <l n="201">For the coming of Mondamin ,</l>
     <l n="202">Till the shadows , pointing eastward ,</l>
     <l n="203">Lengthened over field and forest ,</l>
     <l n="204">Till the sun dropped from the heaven ,</l>
     <l n="205">Floating on the waters westward , 205</l>
     <l n="206">As a red leaf in the Autumn</l>
     <l n="207">Falls and floats upon the water ,</l>
     <l n="208">Falls and sinks into its bosom .</l>
     <l n="209">And behold ! the young Mondamin ,</l>
     <l n="210">With his soft and shining tresses , 210</l>
     <l n="211">With his garments green and yellow ,</l>
     <l n="212">With his long and glossy plumage ,</l>
     <l n="213">Stood and beckoned at the doorway .</l>
     <l n="214">And as one in slumber walking ,</l>
     <l n="215">Pale and haggard , but undaunted , 215</l>
     <l n="216">From the wigwam Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="217">Came and wrestled with Mondamin .</l>
     <l n="218">Round about him spun the landscape ,</l>
     <l n="219">Sky and forest reeled together ,</l>
     <l n="220">And his strong heart leaped within him , 220</l>
     <l n="221">As the sturgeon leaps and struggles</l>
     <l n="222">In a net to break its meshes .</l>
     <l n="223">Like a ring of fire around him</l>
     <l n="224">Blazed and flared the red horizon ,</l>
     <l n="225">And a hundred suns seemed looking 225</l>
     <l n="226">At the combat of the wrestlers .</l>
     <l n="227">Suddenly upon the greensward</l>
     <l n="228">All alone stood Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="229">Panting with his wild exertion ,</l>
     <l n="230">Palpitating with the struggle ; 230</l>
     <l n="231">And before him , breathless , lifeless ,</l>
     <l n="232">Lay the youth , with hair dishevelled ,</l>
     <l n="233">Plumage torn , and garments tattered ,</l>
     <l n="234">Dead he lay there in the sunset .</l>
     <l n="235">And victorious Hiawatha 235</l>
     <l n="236">Made the grave as he commanded ,</l>
     <l n="237">Stripped the garments from Mondamin ,</l>
     <l n="238">Stripped his tattered plumage from him ,</l>
     <l n="239">Laid him in the earth , and made it</l>
     <l n="240">Soft and loose and light above him ; 240</l>
     <l n="241">And the heron , the Shuh-shuh-gah ,</l>
     <l n="242">From the melancholy moorlands ,</l>
     <l n="243">Gave a cry of lamentation ,</l>
     <l n="244">Gave a cry of pain and anguish !</l>
     <l n="245">Homeward then went Hiawatha 245</l>
     <l n="246">To the lodge of old Nokomis ,</l>
     <l n="247">And the seven days of his fasting</l>
     <l n="248">Were accomplished and completed .</l>
     <l n="249">But the place was not forgotten</l>
     <l n="250">Where he wrestled with Mondamin ; 250</l>
     <l n="251">Nor forgotten nor neglected</l>
     <l n="252">Was the grave where lay Mondamin ,</l>
     <l n="253">Sleeping in the rain and sunshine ,</l>
     <l n="254">Where his scattered plumes and garments</l>
     <l n="255">Faded in the rain and sunshine . 255</l>
     <l n="256">Day by day did Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="257">Go to wait and watch beside it ;</l>
     <l n="258">Kept the dark mould soft above it ,</l>
     <l n="259">Kept it clean from weeds and insects ,</l>
     <l n="260">Drove away , with scoffs and shoutings , 260</l>
     <l n="261">Kahgahgee , the king of ravens .</l>
     <l n="262">Till at length a small green feather</l>
     <l n="263">From the earth shot slowly upward ,</l>
     <l n="264">Then another and another ,</l>
     <l n="265">And before the Summer ended 265</l>
     <l n="266">Stood the maize in all its beauty ,</l>
     <l n="267">With its shining robes about it ,</l>
     <l n="268">And its long , soft , yellow tresses ;</l>
     <l n="269">And in rapture Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="270">Cried aloud , “ It is Mondamin ! 270</l>
     <l n="271">Yes , the friend of man , Mondamin ! ”</l>
     <l n="272">Then he called to old Nokomis</l>
     <l n="273">And Iagoo , the great boaster ,</l>
     <l n="274">Showed them where the maize was growing ,</l>
     <l n="275">Told them of his wondrous vision , 275</l>
     <l n="276">Of his wrestling and his triumph ,</l>
     <l n="277">Of this new gift to the nations ,</l>
     <l n="278">Which should be their food forever .</l>
     <l n="279">And still later , when the Autumn</l>
     <l n="280">Changed the long , green leaves to yellow , 280</l>
     <l n="281">And the soft and juicy kernels</l>
     <l n="282">Grew like wampum hard and yellow ,</l>
     <l n="283">Then the ripened ears he gathered ,</l>
     <l n="284">Stripped the withered husks from off them ,</l>
     <l n="285">As he once had stripped the wrestler , 285</l>
     <l n="286">Gave the first Feast of Mondamin ,</l>
     <l n="287">And made known unto the people</l>
     <l n="288">This new gift of the Great Spirit .</l>

    <head>HIAWATHA 'S FRIENDS .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Two good friends had Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="2">Singled out from all the others ,</l>
     <l n="3">Bound to him in closest union ,</l>
     <l n="4">And to whom he gave the right hand</l>
     <l n="5">Of his heart , in joy and sorrow ; 5</l>
     <l n="6">Chibiabos , the musician ,</l>
     <l n="7">And the very strong man , Kwasind .</l>
     <l n="8">Straight between them ran the pathway ,</l>
     <l n="9">Never grew the grass upon it ;</l>
     <l n="10">Singing birds , that utter falsehoods , 10</l>
     <l n="11">Story-tellers , mischief-makers ,</l>
     <l n="12">Found no eager ear to listen ,</l>
     <l n="13">Could not breed ill-will between them ,</l>
     <l n="14">For they kept each other 's counsel ,</l>
     <l n="15">Spake with naked hearts together , 15</l>
     <l n="16">Pondering much and much contriving</l>
     <l n="17">How the tribes of men might prosper .</l>
     <l n="18">Most beloved by Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="19">Was the gentle Chibiabos ,</l>
     <l n="20">He the best of all musicians , 20</l>
     <l n="21">He the sweetest of all singers .</l>
     <l n="22">Beautiful and childlike was he ,</l>
     <l n="23">Brave as man is , soft as woman ,</l>
     <l n="24">Pliant as a wand of willow ,</l>
     <l n="25">Stately as a deer with antlers . 25</l>
     <l n="26">When he sang , the village listened ;</l>
     <l n="27">All the warriors gathered round him ,</l>
     <l n="28">All the women came to hear him ;</l>
     <l n="29">Now he stirred their souls to passion ,</l>
     <l n="30">Now he melted them to pity . 30</l>
     <l n="31">From the hollow reeds he fashioned</l>
     <l n="32">Flutes so musical and mellow ,</l>
     <l n="33">That the brook , the Sebowisha ,</l>
     <l n="34">Ceased to murmur in the woodland ,</l>
     <l n="35">That the wood-birds ceased from singing , 35</l>
     <l n="36">And the squirrel , Adjidaumo ,</l>
     <l n="37">Ceased his chatter in the oak-tree ,</l>
     <l n="38">And the rabbit , the Wabasso ,</l>
     <l n="39">Sat upright to look and listen .</l>
     <l n="40">Yes , the brook , the Sebowisha , 40</l>
     <l n="41">Pausing , said , “ O Chibiabos ,</l>
     <l n="42">Teach my waves to flow in music ,</l>
     <l n="43">Softly as your words in singing ! ”</l>
     <l n="44">Yes , the bluebird , the Owaissa ,</l>
     <l n="45">Envious , said , “ O Chibiabos , 45</l>
     <l n="46">Teach me tones as wild and wayward ,</l>
     <l n="47">Teach me songs as full of frenzy ! ”</l>
     <l n="48">Yes , the Opechee , the robin ,</l>
     <l n="49">Joyous , said , “ O Chibiabos ,</l>
     <l n="50">Teach me tones as sweet and tender , 50</l>
     <l n="51">Teach me songs as full of gladness ! ”</l>
     <l n="52">And the whippoorwill , Wawonaissa ,</l>
     <l n="53">Sobbing , said , “ O Chibiabos ,</l>
     <l n="54">Teach me tones as melancholy ,</l>
     <l n="55">Teach me songs as full of sadness ! ” 55</l>
     <l n="56">All the many sounds of nature</l>
     <l n="57">Borrowed sweetness from his singing ;</l>
     <l n="58">All the hearts of men were softened</l>
     <l n="59">By the pathos of his music ;</l>
     <l n="60">For he sang of peace and freedom , 60</l>
     <l n="61">Sang of beauty , love , and longing ;</l>
     <l n="62">Sang of death , and life undying</l>
     <l n="63">In the Islands of the Blessed ,</l>
     <l n="64">In the kingdom of Ponemah ,</l>
     <l n="65">In the land of the Hereafter . 65</l>
     <l n="66">Very dear to Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="67">Was the gentle Chibiabos ,</l>
     <l n="68">He the best of all musicians ,</l>
     <l n="69">He the sweetest of all singers ;</l>
     <l n="70">For his gentleness he loved him , 70</l>
     <l n="71">And the magic of his singing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="72">Dear , too , unto Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="73">Was the very strong man , Kwasind ,</l>
     <l n="74">He the strongest of all mortals ,</l>
     <l n="75">He the mightiest among many ; 75</l>
     <l n="76">For his very strength he loved him ,</l>
     <l n="77">For his strength allied to goodness .</l>
     <l n="78">Idle in his youth was Kwasind ,</l>
     <l n="79">Very listless , dull , and dreamy ,</l>
     <l n="80">Never played with other children , 80</l>
     <l n="81">Never fished and never hunted ,</l>
     <l n="82">Not like other children was he ;</l>
     <l n="83">But they saw that much he fasted ,</l>
     <l n="84">Much his Manito entreated ,</l>
     <l n="85">Much besought his Guardian Spirit . 85</l>
     <l n="86">“ Lazy Kwasind ! ” said his mother ,</l>
     <l n="87">“ In my work you never help me !</l>
     <l n="88">In the Summer you are roaming</l>
     <l n="89">Idly in the fields and forests ;</l>
     <l n="90">In the Winter you are cowering 90</l>
     <l n="91">O'er the firebrands in the wigwam !</l>
     <l n="92">In the coldest days of Winter</l>
     <l n="93">I must break the ice for fishing ;</l>
     <l n="94">With my nets you never help me !</l>
     <l n="95">At the door my nets are hanging , 95</l>
     <l n="96">Dripping , freezing with the water ;</l>
     <l n="97">Go and wring them , Yenadizze !</l>
     <l n="98">Go and dry them in the sunshine ! ”</l>
     <l n="99">Slowly , from the ashes , Kwasind</l>
     <l n="100">Rose , but made no angry answer ; 100</l>
     <l n="101">From the lodge went forth in silence ,</l>
     <l n="102">Took the nets , that hung together ,</l>
     <l n="103">Dripping , freezing at the doorway ;</l>
     <l n="104">Like a wisp of straw he wrung them ,</l>
     <l n="105">Like a wisp of straw he broke them , 105</l>
     <l n="106">Could not wring them without breaking ,</l>

     <l n="134">But before his pipe was finished ,</l>
     <l n="135">Lo ! the path was cleared before him : 130</l>
     <l n="136">All the trunks had Kwasind lifted ,</l>
     <l n="137">To the right hand , to the left hand ,</l>
     <l n="138">Shot the pine-trees swift as arrows ,</l>
     <l n="139">Hurled the cedars light as lances .</l>
     <l n="140">“ Lazy Kwasind ! ” said the young men , 135</l>
     <l n="141">As they sported in the meadow ;</l>
     <l n="142">“ Why standing idly looking at us ,</l>
     <l n="143">Leaning on the rock behind you ?</l>
     <l n="144">Come and wrestle with the others ,</l>
     <l n="145">Let us pitch the quoit together ! ” 140</l>
     <l n="146">Lazy Kwasind made no answer ,</l>
     <l n="147">To their challenge made no answer ,</l>
     <l n="148">Only rose , and , slowly turning ,</l>
     <l n="149">Seized the huge rock in his fingers ,</l>
     <l n="150">Tore it from its deep foundation , 145</l>
     <l n="151">Poised it in the air a moment ,</l>
     <l n="152">Pitched it sheer into the river ,</l>
     <l n="153">Sheer into the swift Pauwating ,</l>
     <l n="154">Where it still is seen in Summer .</l>
     <l n="155">Once as down that foaming river , 150</l>
     <l n="156">Down the rapids of Pauwating ,</l>
     <l n="157">Kwasind sailed with his companions ,</l>
     <l n="158">In the stream he saw a beaver ,</l>
     <l n="159">Saw Ahmeek , the King of Beavers ,</l>
     <l n="160">Struggling with the rushing currents , 155</l>
     <l n="161">Rising , sinking in the water .</l>
     <l n="162">Without speaking , without pausing ,</l>
     <l n="163">Kwasind leaped into the river ,</l>
     <l n="164">Plunged beneath the bubbling surface ,</l>
     <l n="165">Through the whirlpools chased the beaver , 160</l>
     <l n="166">Followed him among the islands ,</l>
     <l n="167">Stayed so long beneath the water ,</l>
     <l n="168">That his terrified companions</l>
     <l n="169">Cried , “ Alas ! good-by to Kwasind !</l>
     <l n="170">We shall never more see Kwasind ! ” 165</l>
     <l n="171">But he reappeared triumphant ,</l>
     <l n="172">And upon his shining shoulders</l>
     <l n="173">Brought the beaver , dead and dripping ,</l>
     <l n="174">Brought the King of all the Beavers .</l>
     <l n="175">And these two , as I have told you , 170</l>
     <l n="176">Were the friends of Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="177">Chibiabos , the musician ,</l>
     <l n="178">And the very strong man , Kwasind .</l>
     <l n="179">Long they lived in peace together ,</l>
     <l n="180">Spake with naked hearts together , 175</l>
     <l n="181">Pondering much and much contriving</l>
     <l n="182">How the tribes of men might prosper .</l>

     <l n="1">Give me of your bark , O Birch-Tree !</l>
     <l n="2">Of your yellow bark , O Birch-Tree !</l>
     <l n="3">Growing by the rushing river ,</l>
     <l n="4">Tall and stately in the valley !</l>
     <l n="5">I a light canoe will build me , 5</l>
     <l n="6">Build a swift Cheemaun for sailing ,</l>
     <l n="7">That shall float upon the river ,</l>
     <l n="8">Like a yellow leaf in Autumn ,</l>
     <l n="9">Like a yellow water-lily !</l>
     <l n="10">“ Lay aside your cloak , O Birch-Tree ! 10</l>
     <l n="11">Lay aside your white-skin wrapper ,</l>
     <l n="12">For the summer-time is coming ,</l>
     <l n="13">And the sun is warm in heaven ,</l>
     <l n="14">And you need no white-skin wrapper ! ”</l>
     <l n="15">Thus aloud cried Hiawatha 15</l>
     <l n="16">In the solitary forest ,</l>
     <l n="17">By the rushing Taquamenaw ,</l>
     <l n="18">When the birds were singing gayly ,</l>
     <l n="19">In the Moon of Leaves were singing ,</l>
     <l n="20">And the sun , from sleep awaking , 20</l>
     <l n="21">Started up and said , “ Behold me !</l>
     <l n="22">Gheezis , the great Sun , behold me ! ”</l>
     <l n="23">And the tree with all its branches</l>
     <l n="24">Rustled in the breeze of morning ,</l>
     <l n="25">Saying , with a sigh of patience , 25</l>
     <l n="26">“ Take my cloak , O Hiawatha ! ”</l>
     <l n="27">With his knife the tree he girdled ;</l>
     <l n="28">Just beneath its lowest branches ,</l>
     <l n="29">Just above the roots , he cut it ,</l>
     <l n="30">Till the sap came oozing outward ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">Down the trunk , from top to bottom ,</l>
     <l n="32">Sheer he cleft the bark asunder ,</l>
     <l n="33">With a wooden wedge he raised it ,</l>
     <l n="34">Stripped it from the trunk unbroken .</l>
     <l n="35">“ Give me of your boughs , O Cedar ! 35</l>
     <l n="36">Of your strong and pliant branches ,</l>
     <l n="37">My canoe to make more steady ,</l>
     <l n="38">Make more strong and firm beneath me ! ”</l>
     <l n="39">Through the summit of the Cedar</l>
     <l n="40">Went a sound , a cry of horror , 40</l>
     <l n="41">Went a murmur of resistance ;</l>
     <l n="42">But it whispered , bending downward ,</l>
     <l n="43">“ Take my boughs , O Hiawatha ! ”</l>
     <l n="44">Down he hewed the boughs of cedar ,</l>
     <l n="45">Shaped them straightway to a framework , 45</l>
     <l n="46">Like two bows he formed and shaped them ,</l>
     <l n="47">Like two bended bows together .</l>
     <l n="48">“ Give me of your roots , O Tamarack !</l>
     <l n="49">Of your fibrous roots , O Larch-Tree !</l>
     <l n="50">My canoe to bind together , 50</l>
     <l n="51">So to bind the ends together</l>
     <l n="52">That the water may not enter ,</l>
     <l n="53">That the river may not wet me ! ”</l>
     <l n="54">And the Larch , with all its fibres ,</l>
     <l n="55">Shivered in the air of morning , 55</l>
     <l n="56">Touched his forehead with its tassels ,</l>
     <l n="57">Said , with one long sigh of sorrow ,</l>
     <l n="58">“ Take them all , O Hiawatha ! ”</l>
     <l n="59">From the earth he tore the fibres ,</l>
     <l n="60">Tore the tough roots of the Larch-Tree , 60</l>
     <l n="61">Closely sewed the bark together ,</l>
     <l n="62">Bound it closely to the framework .</l>
     <l n="63">“ Give me of your balm , O Fir-Tree !</l>
     <l n="64">Of your balsam and your resin ,</l>
     <l n="65">So to close the seams together 65</l>
     <l n="66">That the water may not enter ,</l>
     <l n="67">That the river may not wet me ! ”</l>
     <l n="68">And the Fir-Tree , tall and sombre ,</l>
     <l n="69">Sobbed through all its robes of darkness ,</l>
     <l n="70">Rattled like a shore with pebbles , 70</l>
     <l n="71">Answered wailing , answered weeping ,</l>
     <l n="72">“ Take my balm , O Hiawatha ! ”</l>
     <l n="73">And he took the tears of balsam ,</l>
     <l n="74">Took the resin of the Fir-Tree ,</l>
     <l n="75">Smeared therewith each seam and fissure , 75</l>
     <l n="76">Made each crevice safe from water .</l>
     <l n="77">“ Give me of your quills , O Hedgehog !</l>
     <l n="78">All your quills , O Kagh , the Hedgehog !</l>
     <l n="79">I will make a necklace of them ,</l>
     <l n="80">Make a girdle for my beauty , 80</l>
     <l n="81">And two stars to deck her bosom ! ”</l>
     <l n="82">From a hollow tree the Hedgehog</l>
     <l n="83">With his sleepy eyes looked at him ,</l>
     <l n="84">Shot his shining quills , like arrows ,</l>
     <l n="85">Saying , with a drowsy murmur , 85</l>
     <l n="86">Through the tangle of his whiskers ,</l>
     <l n="87">“ Take my quills , O Hiawatha ! ”</l>
     <l n="88">From the ground the quills he gathered ,</l>
     <l n="89">All the little shining arrows ,</l>
     <l n="90">Stained them red and blue and yellow , 90</l>
     <l n="91">With the juice of roots and berries ;</l>
     <l n="92">Into his canoe he wrought them ,</l>
     <l n="93">Round its waist a shining girdle ,</l>
     <l n="94">Round its bows a gleaming necklace ,</l>
     <l n="95">On its breast two stars resplendent . 95</l>

     <l n="8">All alone went Hiawatha .</l>
     <l n="9">Through the clear , transparent water</l>
     <l n="10">He could see the fishes swimming 10</l>
     <l n="11">Far down in the depths below him ;</l>
     <l n="12">See the yellow perch , the Sahwa ,</l>

     <l n="24">Played as in the prairie grasses .</l>
     <l n="25">On the white sand of the bottom 25</l>
     <l n="26">Lay the monster Mishe-Nahma ,</l>
     <l n="27">Lay the sturgeon , King of Fishes ;</l>
     <l n="28">Through his gills he breathed the water ,</l>
     <l n="29">With his fins he fanned and winnowed ,</l>
     <l n="30">With his tail he swept the sand-floor . 30</l>
     <l n="31">There he lay in all his armor ;</l>
     <l n="32">On each side a shield to guard him ,</l>
     <l n="33">Plates of bone upon his forehead ,</l>
     <l n="34">Down his sides and back and shoulders</l>

     <l n="40">Fanning with his fins of purple , 40</l>
     <l n="41">As above him Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="42">In his birch canoe came sailing ,</l>
     <l n="43">With his fishing-line of cedar .</l>
     <l n="44">“ Take my bait ! ” cried Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="45">Down into the depths beneath him , 45</l>
     <l n="46">“ Take my bait , O Sturgeon , Nahma !</l>
     <l n="47">Come up from below the water ,</l>
     <l n="48">Let us see which is the stronger ! ”</l>
     <l n="49">And he dropped his line of cedar</l>
     <l n="50">Through the clear , transparent water , 50</l>
     <l n="51">Waited vainly for an answer ,</l>
     <l n="52">Long sat waiting for an answer ,</l>
     <l n="53">And repeating loud and louder ,</l>
     <l n="54">“ Take my bait , O King of Fishes ! ”</l>
     <l n="55">Quiet lay the sturgeon , Nahma , 55</l>
     <l n="56">Fanning slowly in the water ,</l>
     <l n="57">Looking up at Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="58">Listening to his call and clamor ,</l>
     <l n="59">His unnecessary tumult ,</l>
     <l n="60">Till he wearied of the shouting ; 60</l>
     <l n="61">And he said to the Kenozha ,</l>
     <l n="62">To the pike , the Maskenozha ,</l>
     <l n="63">“ Take the bait of this rude fellow ,</l>
     <l n="64">Break the line of Hiawatha ! ”</l>
     <l n="65">In his fingers Hiawatha 65</l>
     <l n="66">Felt the loose line jerk and tighten ;</l>
     <l n="67">As he drew it in , it tugged so ,</l>
     <l n="68">That the birch canoe stood endwise ,</l>
     <l n="69">Like a birch log in the water ,</l>
     <l n="70">With the squirrel , Adjidaumo , 70</l>
     <l n="71">Perched and frisking on the summit .</l>
     <l n="72">Full of scorn was Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="73">When he saw the fish rise upward ,</l>
     <l n="74">Saw the pike , the Maskenozha ,</l>
     <l n="75">Coming nearer , nearer to him , 75</l>
     <l n="76">And he shouted through the water ,</l>
     <l n="77">“ Esa ! esa ! shame upon you !</l>
     <l n="78">You are but the pike , Kenozha ,</l>
     <l n="79">You are not the fish I wanted ,</l>
     <l n="80">You are not the King of Fishes ! ” 80</l>
     <l n="81">Reeling downward to the bottom</l>
     <l n="82">Sank the pike in great confusion ,</l>
     <l n="83">And the mighty sturgeon , Nahma ,</l>
     <l n="84">Said to Ugudwash , the sun-fish ,</l>
     <l n="85">“ Take the bait of this great boaster , 85</l>
     <l n="86">Break the line of Hiawatha ! ”</l>
     <l n="87">Slowly upward , wavering , gleaming ,</l>
     <l n="88">Like a white moon in the water ;</l>
     <l n="89">Rose the Ugudwash , the sun-fish ,</l>
     <l n="90">Seized the line of Hiawatha , 90</l>
     <l n="91">Swung with all his weight upon it ,</l>
     <l n="92">Made a whirlpool in the water ,</l>
     <l n="93">Whirled the birch canoe in circles ,</l>
     <l n="94">Round and round in gurgling eddies ,</l>
     <l n="95">Till the circles in the water 95</l>
     <l n="96">Reached the far-off sandy beaches ,</l>
     <l n="97">Till the water-flags and rushes</l>
     <l n="98">Nodded on the distant margins .</l>
     <l n="99">But when Hiawatha saw him</l>
     <l n="100">Slowly rising through the water , 100</l>
     <l n="101">Lifting his great disc of whiteness ,</l>
     <l n="102">Loud he shouted in derision ,</l>
     <l n="103">“ Esa ! esa ! shame upon you !</l>
     <l n="104">You are Ugudwash , the sun-fish ,</l>
     <l n="105">You are not the fish I wanted , 105</l>
     <l n="106">You are not the King of Fishes ! ”</l>

     <l n="114">From the white sand of the bottom</l>

     <l n="116">Quivering in each nerve and fibre ,</l>
     <l n="117">Clashing all his plates of armor ,</l>
     <l n="118">Gleaming bright with all his war-paint ;</l>
     <l n="119">In his wrath he darted upward ,</l>
     <l n="120">Flashing leaped into the sunshine , 120</l>
     <l n="121">Opened his great jaws , and swallowed</l>

     <l n="233">Came back from the reedy islands ,</l>
     <l n="234">Clamorous for their morning banquet .</l>
     <l n="235">Three whole days and nights alternate 230</l>
     <l n="236">Old Nokomis and the sea-gulls</l>
     <l n="237">Stripped the oily flesh of Nahma ,</l>
     <l n="238">Till the waves washed through the rib-bones ,</l>

     <l n="5">O'er the water pointing westward , 5</l>
     <l n="6">To the purple clouds of sunset .</l>
     <l n="7">Fiercely the red sun descending</l>
     <l n="8">Burned his way along the heavens ,</l>
     <l n="9">Set the sky on fire behind him ,</l>
     <l n="10">As war-parties , when retreating , 10</l>
     <l n="11">Burn the prairies on their war-trail ;</l>
     <l n="12">And the moon , the Night-sun , eastward ,</l>
     <l n="13">Suddenly starting from his ambush ,</l>
     <l n="14">Followed fast those bloody footprints ,</l>
     <l n="15">Followed in that fiery war-trail , 15</l>
     <l n="16">With its glare upon his features .</l>
     <l n="17">And Nokomis , the old woman ,</l>
     <l n="18">Pointing with her finger westward ,</l>
     <l n="19">Spake these words to Hiawatha :</l>

     <l n="21">Megissogwon , the Magician ,</l>
     <l n="22">Manito of Wealth and Wampum ,</l>

     <l n="26">The Kenabeek , the great serpents ,</l>
     <l n="27">Coiling , playing in the water ;</l>
     <l n="28">You can see the black pitch-water</l>
     <l n="29">Stretching far away beyond them ,</l>
     <l n="30">To the purple clouds of sunset ! 30</l>
     <l n="31">“ He it was who slew my father ,</l>
     <l n="32">By his wicked wiles and cunning ,</l>
     <l n="33">When he from the moon descended ,</l>
     <l n="34">When he came on earth to seek me .</l>
     <l n="35">He , the mightiest of Magicians , 35</l>
     <l n="36">Sends the fever from the marshes ,</l>
     <l n="37">Sends the pestilential vapors ,</l>
     <l n="38">Sends the poisonous exhalations ,</l>
     <l n="39">Sends the white fog from the fen-lands ,</l>
     <l n="40">Sends disease and death among us ! 40</l>
     <l n="41">“ Take your bow , O Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="42">Take your arrows , jasper-headed ,</l>
     <l n="43">Take your war-club , Puggawaugun ,</l>
     <l n="44">And your mittens , Minjekahwun ,</l>
     <l n="45">And your birch canoe for sailing , 45</l>
     <l n="46">And the oil of Mishe-Nahma ,</l>

     <l n="53">Straightway then my Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="54">Armed himself with all his war-gear ,</l>
     <l n="55">Launched his birch canoe for sailing ; 55</l>
     <l n="56">With his palm its sides he patted ,</l>
     <l n="57">Said with glee , “ Cheemaun , my darling ,</l>

     <l n="66">Master of all fowls with feathers ,</l>
     <l n="67">Screamed and hurtled through the heavens .</l>
     <l n="68">Soon he reached the fiery serpents ,</l>
     <l n="69">The Kenabeek , the great serpents ,</l>
     <l n="70">Lying huge upon the water , 70</l>
     <l n="71">Sparkling , rippling in the water ,</l>
     <l n="72">Lying coiled across the passage ,</l>
     <l n="73">With their blazing crests uplifted ,</l>
     <l n="74">Breathing fiery fogs and vapors ,</l>
     <l n="75">So that none could pass beyond them . 75</l>
     <l n="76">But the fearless Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="77">Cried aloud , and spake in this wise :</l>
     <l n="78">“ Let me pass my way , Kenabeek ,</l>
     <l n="79">Let me go upon my journey ! ”</l>
     <l n="80">And they answered , hissing fiercely , 80</l>
     <l n="81">With their fiery breath made answer :</l>
     <l n="82">“ Back , go back ! O Shaugodaya !</l>
     <l n="83">Back to old Nokomis , Faint-heart ! ”</l>
     <l n="84">Then the angry Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="85">Raised his mighty bow of ash-tree , 85</l>
     <l n="86">Seized his arrows , jasper-headed ,</l>
     <l n="87">Shot them fast among the serpents ;</l>
     <l n="88">Every twanging of the bow-string</l>
     <l n="89">Was a war-cry and a death-cry ,</l>
     <l n="90">Every whizzing of an arrow 90</l>
     <l n="91">Was a death-song of Kenabeek .</l>
     <l n="92">Weltering in the bloody water ,</l>
     <l n="93">Dead lay all the fiery serpents ,</l>
     <l n="94">And among them Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="95">Harmless sailed , and cried exulting : 95</l>
     <l n="96">“ Onward , O Cheemaun , my darling !</l>
     <l n="97">Onward to the black pitch-water ! ”</l>
     <l n="98">Then he took the oil of Nahma ,</l>
     <l n="99">And the bows and sides anointed ,</l>
     <l n="100">Smeared them well with oil , that swiftly 100</l>
     <l n="101">He might pass the black pitch-water .</l>
     <l n="102">All night long he sailed upon it ,</l>
     <l n="103">Sailed upon that sluggish water ,</l>
     <l n="104">Covered with its mould of ages ,</l>
     <l n="105">Black with rotting water-rushes , 105</l>
     <l n="106">Rank with flags and leaves of lilies ,</l>

     <l n="173">Cried he in a voice of thunder ,</l>
     <l n="174">In a tone of loud derision .</l>
     <l n="175">“ Hasten back , O Shaugodaya ! 170</l>
     <l n="176">Hasten back among the women ,</l>
     <l n="177">Back to old Nokomis , Faint-heart !</l>
     <l n="178">I will slay you as you stand there ,</l>
     <l n="179">As of old I slew her father ! ”</l>
     <l n="180">But my Hiawatha answered , 175</l>
     <l n="181">Nothing daunted , fearing nothing :</l>
     <l n="182">“ Big words do not smite like war-clubs ,</l>
     <l n="183">Boastful breath is not a bow-string ,</l>
     <l n="184">Taunts are not as sharp as arrows ,</l>
     <l n="185">Deeds are better things than words are , 180</l>
     <l n="186">Actions mightier than boastings ! ”</l>
     <l n="187">Then began the greatest battle</l>
     <l n="188">That the sun had ever looked on ,</l>
     <l n="189">That the war-birds ever witnessed .</l>
     <l n="190">All a Summer 's day it lasted , 185</l>
     <l n="191">From the sunrise to the sunset ;</l>
     <l n="192">For the shafts of Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="193">Harmless hit the shirt of wampum ,</l>
     <l n="194">Harmless fell the blows he dealt it</l>
     <l n="195">With his mittens , Minjekahwun , 190</l>
     <l n="196">Harmless fell the heavy war-club ;</l>
     <l n="197">It could dash the rocks asunder ,</l>
     <l n="198">But it could not break the meshes</l>
     <l n="199">Of that magic shirt of wampum .</l>
     <l n="200">Till at sunset Hiawatha , 195</l>
     <l n="201">Leaning on his bow of ash-tree ,</l>
     <l n="202">Wounded , weary , and desponding ,</l>
     <l n="203">With his mighty war-club broken ,</l>
     <l n="204">With his mittens torn and tattered ,</l>
     <l n="205">And three useless arrows only , 200</l>
     <l n="206">Paused to rest beneath a pine-tree ,</l>
     <l n="207">From whose branches trailed the mosses ,</l>
     <l n="208">And whose trunk was coated over</l>

     <l n="219">Winged with feathers , tipped with jasper ,</l>
     <l n="220">Swift flew Hiawatha 's arrow ,</l>
     <l n="221">Just as Megissogwon , stooping , 215</l>
     <l n="222">Raised a heavy stone to throw it .</l>

     <l n="228">When the snow is on the prairie .</l>
     <l n="229">Swifter flew the second arrow ,</l>
     <l n="230">In the pathway of the other ,</l>
     <l n="231">Piercing deeper than the other , 225</l>
     <l n="232">Wounding sorer than the other ;</l>

     <l n="237">Swiftest flew , and wounded sorest ,</l>
     <l n="238">And the mighty Megissogwon</l>
     <l n="239">Saw the fiery eyes of Pauguk ,</l>
     <l n="240">Saw the eyes of Death glare at him ,</l>
     <l n="241">Heard his voice call in the darkness ; 235</l>
     <l n="242">At the feet of Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="243">Lifeless lay the great Pearl-Feather ,</l>

     <l n="247">From his perch among the branches</l>

     <l n="249">And , in honor of his service ,</l>
     <l n="250">Stained with blood the tuft of feathers</l>

     <l n="253">Wears the tuft of crimson feathers</l>
     <l n="254">As a symbol of his service .</l>

     <l n="257">As a trophy of the battle ,</l>

     <l n="4">Though she draws him , yet she follows ,</l>
     <l n="5">Useless each without the other ! ” 5</l>
     <l n="6">Thus the youthful Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="7">Said within himself and pondered ,</l>
     <l n="8">Much perplexed by various feelings ,</l>
     <l n="9">Listless , longing , hoping , fearing ,</l>
     <l n="10">Dreaming still of Minnehaha , 10</l>
     <l n="11">Of the lovely Laughing Water ,</l>
     <l n="12">In the land of the Dacotahs .</l>
     <l n="13">“ Wed a maiden of your people , ”</l>
     <l n="14">Warning said the old Nokomis ;</l>
     <l n="15">“ Go not eastward , go not westward , 15</l>
     <l n="16">For a stranger , whom we know not !</l>
     <l n="17">Like a fire upon the hearth-stone</l>
     <l n="18">Is a neighbor 's homely daughter ,</l>
     <l n="19">Like the starlight or the moonlight</l>
     <l n="20">Is the handsomest of strangers ! ” 20</l>
     <l n="21">Thus dissuading spake Nokomis ,</l>
     <l n="22">And my Hiawatha answered</l>
     <l n="23">Only this : “ Dear old Nokomis ,</l>
     <l n="24">Very pleasant is the firelight ,</l>
     <l n="25">But I like the starlight better , 25</l>
     <l n="26">Better do I like the moonlight ! ”</l>
     <l n="27">Gravely then said old Nokomis :</l>
     <l n="28">“ Bring not here an idle maiden ,</l>
     <l n="29">Bring not here a useless woman ,</l>
     <l n="30">Hands unskilful , feet unwilling ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">Bring a wife with nimble fingers ,</l>
     <l n="32">Heart and hand that move together ,</l>
     <l n="33">Feet that run on willing errands ! ”</l>
     <l n="34">Smiling answered Hiawatha :</l>
     <l n="35">“ In the land of the Dacotahs 35</l>
     <l n="36">Lives the Arrow-maker 's daughter ,</l>
     <l n="37">Minnehaha , Laughing Water ,</l>

     <l n="39">I will bring her to your wigwam ,</l>
     <l n="40">She shall run upon your errands , 40</l>
     <l n="41">Be your starlight , moonlight , firelight ,</l>
     <l n="42">Be the sunlight of my people ! ”</l>
     <l n="43">Still dissuading said Nokomis :</l>
     <l n="44">“ Bring not to my lodge a stranger</l>
     <l n="45">From the land of the Dacotahs ! 45</l>
     <l n="46">Very fierce are the Dacotahs ,</l>
     <l n="47">Often is there war between us ,</l>
     <l n="48">There are feuds yet unforgotten ,</l>
     <l n="49">Wounds that ache and still may open ! ”</l>
     <l n="50">Laughing answered Hiawatha : 50</l>
     <l n="51">“ For that reason , if no other ,</l>
     <l n="52">Would I wed the fair Dacotah ,</l>
     <l n="53">That our tribes might be united ,</l>
     <l n="54">That old feuds might be forgotten ,</l>

     <l n="61">Through uninterrupted silence .</l>
     <l n="62">With his moccasins of magic ,</l>
     <l n="63">At each stride a mile he measured ;</l>
     <l n="64">Yet the way seemed long before him ,</l>
     <l n="65">And his heart outrun his footsteps ; 65</l>
     <l n="66">And he journeyed without resting ,</l>
     <l n="67">Till he heard the cataract 's thunder ,</l>
     <l n="68">Heard the Falls of Minnehaha</l>
     <l n="69">Calling to him through the silence .</l>
     <l n="70">“ Pleasant is the sound ! ” he murmured , 70</l>
     <l n="71">“ Pleasant is the voice that calls me ! ”</l>
     <l n="72">On the outskirts of the forest ,</l>
     <l n="73">‘ Twixt the shadow and the sunshine ,</l>
     <l n="74">Herds of fallow deer were feeding ,</l>

     <l n="77">To his arrow whispered , “ Swerve not ! ”</l>
     <l n="78">Sent it singing on its errand ,</l>
     <l n="79">To the red heart of the roebuck ;</l>

     <l n="186">Paused a moment ere he answered ,</l>
     <l n="187">Smoked a little while in silence ,</l>
     <l n="188">Looked at Hiawatha proudly ,</l>
     <l n="189">Fondly looked at Laughing Water ,</l>
     <l n="190">And made answer very gravely : 185</l>
     <l n="191">“ Yes , if Minnehaha wishes ;</l>
     <l n="192">Let your heart speak , Minnehaha ! ”</l>
     <l n="193">And the lovely Laughing Water</l>
     <l n="194">Seemed more lovely , as she stood there ,</l>
     <l n="195">Neither willing nor reluctant , 190</l>
     <l n="196">As she went to Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="197">Softly took the seat beside him ,</l>

     <l n="196">Never any marvellous story</l>
     <l n="197">But himself could tell a stranger . 195</l>
     <l n="198">Would you listen to his boasting ,</l>
     <l n="199">Would you only give him credence ,</l>
     <l n="200">No one ever shot an arrow</l>
     <l n="201">Half so far and high as he had ;</l>

     <l n="1">Can it be the sun descending</l>
     <l n="2">O'er the level plain of water ?</l>
     <l n="3">Or the Red Swan floating , flying ,</l>
     <l n="4">Wounded by the magic arrow ,</l>
     <l n="5">Staining all the waves with crimson , 5</l>
     <l n="6">With the crimson of its life-blood ,</l>
     <l n="7">Filling all the air with splendor ,</l>
     <l n="8">With the splendor of its plumage ?</l>
     <l n="9">Yes ; it is the sun descending ,</l>
     <l n="10">Sinking down into the water ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">All the sky is stained with purple ,</l>
     <l n="12">All the water flushed with crimson !</l>
     <l n="13">No ; it is the Red Swan floating ,</l>
     <l n="14">Diving down beneath the water ;</l>
     <l n="15">To the sky its wings are lifted , 15</l>
     <l n="16">With its blood the waves are reddened !</l>
     <l n="17">Over it the Star of Evening</l>
     <l n="18">Melts and trembles through the purple ,</l>
     <l n="19">Hangs suspended in the twilight .</l>
     <l n="20">No ; it is a bead of wampum 20</l>
     <l n="21">On the robes of the Great Spirit ,</l>
     <l n="22">As he passes through the twilight ,</l>
     <l n="23">Walks in silence through the heavens .</l>
     <l n="24">This with joy beheld Iagoo</l>
     <l n="25">And he said in haste : “ Behold it ! 25</l>
     <l n="26">See the sacred Star of Evening !</l>
     <l n="27">You shall hear a tale of wonder ,</l>
     <l n="28">Hear the story of Osseo !</l>
     <l n="29">Son of the Evening Star , Osseo !</l>
     <l n="30">“ Once , in days no more remembered , 30</l>
     <l n="31">Ages nearer the beginning ,</l>
     <l n="32">When the heavens were closer to us ,</l>
     <l n="33">And the Gods were more familiar ,</l>
     <l n="34">In the North-land lived a hunter ,</l>
     <l n="35">With ten young and comely daughters , 35</l>
     <l n="36">Tall and lithe as wands of willow ;</l>
     <l n="37">Only Oweenee , the youngest ,</l>
     <l n="38">She the wilful and the wayward ,</l>
     <l n="39">She the silent dreamy maiden ,</l>
     <l n="40">Was the fairest of the sisters . 40</l>
     <l n="41">“ All these women married warriors ,</l>
     <l n="42">Married brave and haughty husbands ;</l>
     <l n="43">Only Oweenee , the youngest ,</l>
     <l n="44">Laughed and flouted all her lovers ,</l>
     <l n="45">All her young and handsome suitors , 45</l>
     <l n="46">And then married old Osseo ,</l>
     <l n="47">Old Osseo , poor and ugly ,</l>
     <l n="48">Broken with age and weak with coughing ,</l>
     <l n="49">Always coughing like a squirrel .</l>
     <l n="50">“ Ah , but beautiful within him 50</l>
     <l n="51">Was the spirit of Osseo ,</l>
     <l n="52">From the Evening Star descended ,</l>
     <l n="53">Star of Evening , Star of Woman ,</l>
     <l n="54">Star of tenderness and passion !</l>
     <l n="55">All its fire was in his bosom 55</l>
     <l n="56">All its beauty in his spirit ,</l>
     <l n="57">All its mystery in his being ,</l>
     <l n="58">All its splendor in his language !</l>
     <l n="59">“ And her lovers , the rejected ,</l>
     <l n="60">Handsome men with belts of wampum , 60</l>
     <l n="61">Handsome men with paint and feathers ,</l>
     <l n="62">Pointed at her in derision ,</l>
     <l n="63">Followed her with jest and laughter .</l>
     <l n="64">But she said : ‘ I care not for you ,</l>
     <l n="65">Care not for your belts of wampum , 65</l>
     <l n="66">Care not for your paint and feathers ,</l>
     <l n="67">Care not for your jest and laughter ;</l>
     <l n="68">I am happy with Osseo ! ’</l>
     <l n="69">“ Once to some great feast invited ,</l>
     <l n="70">Through the damp and dusk of evening 70</l>
     <l n="71">Walked together the ten sisters ,</l>
     <l n="72">Walked together with their husbands ;</l>
     <l n="73">Slowly followed old Osseo ,</l>
     <l n="74">With fair Oweenee beside him ;</l>
     <l n="75">All the others chatted gayly , 75</l>
     <l n="76">These two only walked in silence .</l>
     <l n="77">“ At the western sky Osseo</l>
     <l n="78">Gazed intent , as if imploring ,</l>
     <l n="79">Often stopped and gazed imploring</l>
     <l n="80">At the trembling Star of Evening , 80</l>
     <l n="81">At the tender Star of Woman ;</l>
     <l n="82">And they heard him murmur softly ,</l>
     <l n="83">‘ Ah , showain nemeshin , Nosa !</l>
     <l n="84">Pity , pity me , my father ! ’</l>
     <l n="85">“ ‘ Listen ! ’ said the elder sister , 85</l>
     <l n="86">‘ He is praying to his father !</l>
     <l n="87">What a pity that the old man</l>
     <l n="88">Does not stumble in the pathway ,</l>
     <l n="89">Does not break his neck by falling ! ’</l>
     <l n="90">And they laughed till all the forest 90</l>
     <l n="91">Rang with their unseemly laughter .</l>
     <l n="92">“ On their pathway through the woodlands</l>
     <l n="93">Lay an oak , by storms uprooted ,</l>
     <l n="94">Lay the great trunk of an oak-tree ,</l>
     <l n="95">Buried half in leaves and mosses , 95</l>
     <l n="96">Mouldering , crumbling , huge and hollow .</l>
     <l n="97">And Osseo , when he saw it ,</l>
     <l n="98">Gave a shout , a cry of anguish ,</l>
     <l n="99">Leaped into its yawning cavern ,</l>
     <l n="100">At one end went in an old man , 100</l>
     <l n="101">Wasted , wrinkled , old , and ugly ;</l>
     <l n="102">From the other came a young man ,</l>
     <l n="103">Tall and straight and strong and handsome .</l>
     <l n="104">“ Thus Osseo was transfigured ,</l>
     <l n="105">Thus restored to youth and beauty ; 105</l>
     <l n="106">But , alas for good Osseo ,</l>
     <l n="107">And for Oweenee , the faithful !</l>
     <l n="108">Strangely , too , was she transfigured .</l>
     <l n="109">Changed into a weak old woman ,</l>
     <l n="110">With a staff she tottered onward , 110</l>
     <l n="111">Wasted , wrinkled , old , and ugly !</l>
     <l n="112">And the sisters and their husbands</l>
     <l n="113">Laughed until the echoing forest</l>
     <l n="114">Rang with their unseemly laughter .</l>
     <l n="115">“ But Osseo turned not from her , 115</l>
     <l n="116">Walked with slower step beside her ,</l>
     <l n="117">Took her hand , as brown and withered</l>
     <l n="118">As an oak-leaf is in winter ,</l>
     <l n="119">Called her sweetheart , Nenemoosha ,</l>
     <l n="120">Soothed her with soft words of kindness , 120</l>
     <l n="121">Till they reached the lodge of feasting ,</l>
     <l n="122">Till they sat down in the wigwam ,</l>
     <l n="123">Sacred to the Star of Evening ,</l>
     <l n="124">To the tender Star of Woman .</l>
     <l n="125">“ Wrapt in visions , lost in dreaming , 125</l>
     <l n="126">At the banquet sat Osseo ;</l>
     <l n="127">All were merry , all were happy ,</l>
     <l n="128">All were joyous but Osseo .</l>
     <l n="129">Neither food nor drink he tasted ,</l>
     <l n="130">Neither did he speak nor listen , 130</l>
     <l n="131">But as one bewildered sat he ,</l>
     <l n="132">Looking dreamily and sadly ,</l>
     <l n="133">First at Oweenee , then upward</l>
     <l n="134">At the gleaming sky above them .</l>
     <l n="135">“ Then a voice was heard , a whisper , 135</l>
     <l n="136">Coming from the starry distance ,</l>
     <l n="137">Coming from the empty vastness ,</l>
     <l n="138">Low , and musical , and tender ;</l>
     <l n="139">And the voice said : ‘ O Osseo !</l>
     <l n="140">O my son , my best beloved ! 140</l>
     <l n="141">Broken are the spells that bound you ,</l>
     <l n="142">All the charms of the magicians ,</l>
     <l n="143">All the magic powers of evil ;</l>
     <l n="144">Come to me ; ascend , Osseo !</l>
     <l n="145">“ ‘ Taste the food that stands before you : 145</l>
     <l n="146">It is blessed and enchanted ,</l>
     <l n="147">It has magic virtues in it ,</l>
     <l n="148">It will change you to a spirit .</l>
     <l n="149">All your bowls and all your kettles</l>
     <l n="150">Shall be wood and clay no longer ; 150</l>
     <l n="151">But the bowls be changed to wampum ,</l>
     <l n="152">And the kettles shall be silver ;</l>
     <l n="153">They shall shine like shells of scarlet ,</l>
     <l n="154">Like the fire shall gleam and glimmer .</l>
     <l n="155">“ ‘ And the women shall no longer 155</l>
     <l n="156">Bear the dreary doom of labor ,</l>
     <l n="157">But be changed to birds , and glisten</l>
     <l n="158">With the beauty of the starlight ,</l>
     <l n="159">Painted with the dusky splendors</l>
     <l n="160">Of the skies and clouds of evening ! ’ 160</l>
     <l n="161">“ What Osseo heard as whispers ,</l>
     <l n="162">What as words he comprehended ,</l>
     <l n="163">Was but music to the others ,</l>
     <l n="164">Music as of birds afar off ,</l>
     <l n="165">Of the whippoorwill afar off , 165</l>
     <l n="166">Of the lonely Wawonaissa</l>
     <l n="167">Singing in the darksome forest .</l>
     <l n="168">“ Then the lodge began to tremble ,</l>
     <l n="169">Straight began to shake and tremble ,</l>
     <l n="170">And they felt it rising , rising , 170</l>
     <l n="171">Slowly through the air ascending ,</l>
     <l n="172">From the darkness of the tree-tops</l>
     <l n="173">Forth into the dewy starlight ,</l>
     <l n="174">Till it passed the topmost branches ;</l>
     <l n="175">And behold ! the wooden dishes 175</l>
     <l n="176">All were changed to shells of scarlet !</l>
     <l n="177">And behold ! the earthen kettles</l>
     <l n="178">All were changed to bowls of silver !</l>
     <l n="179">And the roof-poles of the wigwam</l>
     <l n="180">Were as glittering rods of silver , 180</l>
     <l n="181">And the roof of bark upon them</l>
     <l n="182">As the shining shards of beetles .</l>
     <l n="183">“ Then Osseo gazed around him ,</l>
     <l n="184">And he saw the nine fair sisters ,</l>
     <l n="185">All the sisters and their husbands , 185</l>
     <l n="186">Changed to birds of various plumage .</l>
     <l n="187">Some were jays and some were magpies ,</l>
     <l n="188">Others thrushes , others blackbirds ;</l>
     <l n="189">And they hopped , and sang , and twittered ,</l>
     <l n="190">Perked and fluttered all their feathers , 190</l>
     <l n="191">Strutted in their shining plumage ,</l>
     <l n="192">And their tails like fans unfolded .</l>
     <l n="193">“ Only Oweenee , the youngest ,</l>
     <l n="194">Was not changed , but sat in silence ,</l>
     <l n="195">Wasted , wrinkled , old , and ugly , 195</l>
     <l n="196">Looking sadly at the others ;</l>
     <l n="197">Till Osseo , gazing upward ,</l>
     <l n="198">Gave another cry of anguish ,</l>
     <l n="199">Such a cry as he had uttered</l>
     <l n="200">By the oak-tree in the forest . 200</l>
     <l n="201">“ Then returned her youth and beauty ,</l>
     <l n="202">And her soiled and tattered garments</l>
     <l n="203">Were transformed to robes of ermine ,</l>
     <l n="204">And her staff became a feather ,</l>
     <l n="205">Yes , a shining silver feather ! 205</l>
     <l n="206">“ And again the wigwam trembled ,</l>
     <l n="207">Swayed and rushed through airy currents ,</l>
     <l n="208">Through transparent cloud and vapor ,</l>
     <l n="209">And amid celestial splendors</l>
     <l n="210">On the Evening Star alighted , 210</l>
     <l n="211">As a snow-flake falls on snow-flake ,</l>
     <l n="212">As a leaf drops on a river ,</l>
     <l n="213">As the thistle-down on water .</l>
     <l n="214">“ Forth with cheerful words of welcome</l>
     <l n="215">Came the father of Osseo , 215</l>
     <l n="216">He with radiant locks of silver ,</l>
     <l n="217">He with eyes serene and tender .</l>
     <l n="218">And he said : ‘ My son , Osseo ,</l>
     <l n="219">Hang the cage of birds you bring there ,</l>
     <l n="220">Hang the cage with rods of silver , 220</l>
     <l n="221">And the birds with glistening feathers ,</l>
     <l n="222">At the doorway of my wigwam . ’</l>
     <l n="223">“ At the door he hung the bird-cage ,</l>
     <l n="224">And they entered in and gladly</l>
     <l n="225">Listened to Osseo 's father , 225</l>
     <l n="226">Ruler of the Star of Evening ,</l>
     <l n="227">As he said : ‘ O my Osseo !</l>
     <l n="228">I have had compassion on you ,</l>
     <l n="229">Given you back your youth and beauty ,</l>
     <l n="230">Into birds of various plumage 230</l>
     <l n="231">Changed your sisters and their husbands ;</l>
     <l n="232">Changed them thus because they mocked you ;</l>
     <l n="233">In the figure of the old man ,</l>
     <l n="234">In that aspect sad and wrinkled ,</l>
     <l n="235">Could not see your heart of passion , 235</l>
     <l n="236">Could not see your youth immortal ;</l>
     <l n="237">Only Oweenee , the faithful ,</l>
     <l n="238">Saw your naked heart and loved you .</l>
     <l n="239">“ ‘ In the lodge that glimmers yonder ,</l>
     <l n="240">In the little star that twinkles 240</l>
     <l n="241">Through the vapors , on the left hand ,</l>
     <l n="242">Lives the envious Evil Spirit ,</l>
     <l n="243">The Wabeno , the magician ,</l>
     <l n="244">Who transformed you to an old man .</l>
     <l n="245">Take heed lest his beams fall on you , 245</l>
     <l n="246">For the rays he darts around him</l>
     <l n="247">Are the power of his enchantment ,</l>
     <l n="248">Are the arrows that he uses . ’</l>
     <l n="249">“ Many years , in peace and quiet ,</l>
     <l n="250">On the peaceful Star of Evening 250</l>
     <l n="251">Dwelt Osseo with his father ;</l>
     <l n="252">Many years , in song and flutter ,</l>
     <l n="253">At the doorway of the wigwam ,</l>
     <l n="254">Hung the cage with rods of silver ,</l>
     <l n="255">And fair Oweenee , the faithful , 255</l>
     <l n="256">Bore a son unto Osseo ,</l>
     <l n="257">With the beauty of his mother ,</l>
     <l n="258">With the courage of his father .</l>
     <l n="259">“ And the boy grew up and prospered ,</l>
     <l n="260">And Osseo , to delight him , 260</l>
     <l n="261">Made him little bows and arrows ,</l>
     <l n="262">Opened the great cage of silver ,</l>
     <l n="263">And let loose his aunts and uncles ,</l>
     <l n="264">All those birds with glossy feathers ,</l>
     <l n="265">For his little son to shoot at . 265</l>
     <l n="266">“ Round and round they wheeled and darted ,</l>
     <l n="267">Filled the Evening Star with music ,</l>
     <l n="268">With their songs of joy and freedom ;</l>
     <l n="269">Filled the Evening Star with splendor ,</l>
     <l n="270">With the fluttering of their plumage ; 270</l>
     <l n="271">Till the boy , the little hunter ,</l>
     <l n="272">Bent his bow and shot an arrow ,</l>
     <l n="273">Shot a swift and fatal arrow ,</l>
     <l n="274">And a bird , with shining feathers ,</l>
     <l n="275">At his feet fell wounded sorely . 275</l>
     <l n="276">“ But , O wondrous transformation !</l>
     <l n="277">‘ T was no bird he saw before him !</l>
     <l n="278">‘ T was a beautiful young woman ,</l>
     <l n="279">With the arrow in her bosom !</l>
     <l n="280">“ When her blood fell on the planet , 280</l>
     <l n="281">On the sacred Star of Evening ,</l>
     <l n="282">Broken was the spell of magic ,</l>
     <l n="283">Powerless was the strange enchantment ,</l>
     <l n="284">And the youth , the fearless bowman ,</l>
     <l n="285">Suddenly felt himself descending , 285</l>
     <l n="286">Held by unseen hands , but sinking</l>
     <l n="287">Downward through the empty spaces ,</l>
     <l n="288">Downward through the clouds and vapors ,</l>
     <l n="289">Till he rested on an island ,</l>
     <l n="290">On an island , green and grassy , 290</l>
     <l n="291">Yonder in the Big-Sea-Water .</l>
     <l n="292">“ After him he saw descending</l>
     <l n="293">All the birds with shining feathers ,</l>
     <l n="294">Fluttering , falling , wafted downward ,</l>
     <l n="295">Like the painted leaves of Autumn ; 295</l>
     <l n="296">And the lodge with poles of silver ,</l>
     <l n="297">With its roof like wings of beetles ,</l>
     <l n="298">Like the shining shards of beetles ,</l>
     <l n="299">By the winds of heaven uplifted ,</l>
     <l n="300">Slowly sank upon the island , 300</l>
     <l n="301">Bringing back the good Osseo ,</l>
     <l n="302">Bringing Oweenee , the faithful .</l>
     <l n="303">“ Then the birds , again transfigured ,</l>
     <l n="304">Reassumed the shape of mortals ,</l>
     <l n="305">Took their shape , but not their stature ; 305</l>
     <l n="306">They remained as Little People ,</l>
     <l n="307">Like the pygmies , the Puk-Wudjies ,</l>
     <l n="308">And on pleasant nights of Summer ,</l>
     <l n="309">When the Evening Star was shining ,</l>
     <l n="310">Hand in hand they danced together 310</l>
     <l n="311">On the island 's craggy headlands ,</l>
     <l n="312">On the sand-beach low and level .</l>
     <l n="313">“ Still their glittering lodge is seen there ,</l>
     <l n="314">On the tranquil Summer evenings ,</l>
     <l n="315">And upon the shore the fisher 315</l>
     <l n="316">Sometimes hears their happy voices ,</l>
     <l n="317">Sees them dancing in the starlight ! ”</l>
     <l n="318">When the story was completed ,</l>
     <l n="319">When the wondrous tale was ended ,</l>
     <l n="320">Looking round upon his listeners , 320</l>
     <l n="321">Solemnly Iagoo added :</l>
     <l n="322">“ There are great men , I have known such ,</l>

     <l n="9">Buried were all warlike weapons ,</l>
     <l n="10">And the war-cry was forgotten . 10</l>
     <l n="11">There was peace among the nations ;</l>
     <l n="12">Unmolested roved the hunters ,</l>
     <l n="13">Built the birch canoe for sailing ,</l>
     <l n="14">Caught the fish in lake and river ,</l>
     <l n="15">Shot the deer and trapped the beaver ; 15</l>
     <l n="16">Unmolested worked the women ,</l>
     <l n="17">Made their sugar from the maple ,</l>
     <l n="18">Gathered wild rice in the meadows ,</l>
     <l n="19">Dressed the skins of deer and beaver .</l>
     <l n="20">All around the happy village 20</l>

     <l n="22">Waved the green plumes of Mondamin ,</l>
     <l n="23">Waved his soft and sunny tresses</l>
     <l n="24">Filling all the land with plenty .</l>

     <l n="29">Stripped the yellow husks of harvest ,</l>
     <l n="30">Stripped the garments from Mondamin , 30</l>
     <l n="31">Even as Hiawatha taught them .</l>
     <l n="32">Once , when all the maize was planted ,</l>
     <l n="33">Hiawatha , wise and thoughtful ,</l>
     <l n="34">Spake and said to Minnehaha ,</l>

     <l n="36">“ You shall bless to-night the corn-fields ,</l>
     <l n="37">Draw a magic circle round them ,</l>
     <l n="38">To protect them from destruction ,</l>

     <l n="40">Wagemin , the thief of corn-fields , 40</l>
     <l n="41">Paimosaid , who steals the maize-ear !</l>
     <l n="42">“ In the night , when all is silence ,</l>
     <l n="43">In the night , when all is darkness ,</l>
     <l n="44">When the Spirit of Sleep , Nepahwin ,</l>
     <l n="45">Shuts the doors of all the wigwams , 45</l>
     <l n="46">So that not an ear can hear you ,</l>
     <l n="47">So that not an eye can see you ,</l>
     <l n="48">Rise up from your bed in silence ,</l>
     <l n="49">Lay aside your garments wholly ,</l>
     <l n="50">Walk around the fields you planted , 50</l>
     <l n="51">Round the borders of the corn-fields ,</l>
     <l n="52">Covered by your tresses only ,</l>
     <l n="53">Robed with darkness as a garment .</l>
     <l n="54">“ Thus the fields shall be more fruitful ,</l>
     <l n="55">And the passing of your footsteps 55</l>

     <l n="66">On the tree-tops near the corn-fields</l>
     <l n="67">Sat the hungry crows and ravens ,</l>
     <l n="68">Kahgahgee , the King of Ravens ,</l>
     <l n="69">With his band of black marauders ,</l>
     <l n="70">And they laughed at Hiawatha , 70</l>
     <l n="71">Till the tree-tops shook with laughter ,</l>
     <l n="72">With their melancholy laughter</l>
     <l n="73">At the words of Hiawatha .</l>
     <l n="74">“ Hear him ! ” said they ; “ hear the Wise Man ,</l>

     <l n="79">Sorrowing sang among the hemlocks ,</l>
     <l n="80">And the Spirit of Sleep , Nepahwin , 80</l>
     <l n="81">Shut the doors of all the wigwams ,</l>
     <l n="82">From her bed rose Laughing Water ,</l>
     <l n="83">Laid aside her garments wholly ,</l>
     <l n="84">And with darkness clothed and guarded ,</l>
     <l n="85">Unashamed and unaffrighted , 85</l>
     <l n="86">Walked securely round the corn-fields ,</l>
     <l n="87">Drew the sacred , magic circle</l>
     <l n="88">Of her footprints round the corn-fields .</l>
     <l n="89">No one but the Midnight only</l>
     <l n="90">Saw her beauty in the darkness , 90</l>
     <l n="91">No one but the Wawonaissa</l>
     <l n="92">Heard the panting of her bosom ;</l>
     <l n="93">Guskewau , the darkness , wrapped her</l>
     <l n="94">Closely in his sacred mantle ,</l>
     <l n="95">So that none might see her beauty , 95</l>
     <l n="96">So that none might boast , “ I saw her ! ”</l>
     <l n="97">On the morrow , as the day dawned ,</l>
     <l n="98">Kahgahgee , the King of Ravens ,</l>
     <l n="99">Gathered all his black marauders ,</l>
     <l n="100">Crows and blackbirds , jays and ravens , 100</l>
     <l n="101">Clamorous on the dusky tree-tops ,</l>
     <l n="102">And descended , fast and fearless ,</l>
     <l n="103">On the fields of Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="104">On the grave of the Mondamin .</l>
     <l n="105">“ We will drag Mondamin , ” said they , 105</l>
     <l n="106">“ From the grave where he is buried ,</l>
     <l n="107">Spite of all the magic circles</l>
     <l n="108">Laughing Water draws around it ,</l>
     <l n="109">Spite of all the sacred footprints</l>
     <l n="110">Minnehaha stamps upon it ! ” 110</l>
     <l n="111">But the wary Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="112">Ever thoughtful , careful , watchful ,</l>
     <l n="113">Had o'erheard the scornful laughter</l>
     <l n="114">When they mocked him from the tree-tops .</l>
     <l n="115">“ Kaw ! ” he said , “ my friends the ravens ! 115</l>
     <l n="116">Kahgahgee , my King of Ravens !</l>
     <l n="117">I will teach you all a lesson</l>
     <l n="118">That shall not be soon forgotten ! ”</l>
     <l n="119">He had risen before the daybreak ,</l>
     <l n="120">He had spread o'er all the corn-fields 120</l>
     <l n="121">Snares to catch the black marauders ,</l>
     <l n="122">And was lying now in ambush</l>
     <l n="123">in the neighboring grove of pine-trees ,</l>
     <l n="124">Waiting for the crows and blackbirds ,</l>
     <l n="125">Waiting for the jays and ravens . 125</l>
     <l n="126">Soon they came with caw and clamor ,</l>
     <l n="127">Rush of wings and cry of voices ,</l>
     <l n="128">To their work of devastation ,</l>
     <l n="129">Settling down upon the corn-fields ,</l>
     <l n="130">Delving deep with beak and talon , 130</l>
     <l n="131">For the body of Mondamin .</l>
     <l n="132">And with all their craft and cunning ,</l>
     <l n="133">All their skill in wiles of warfare ,</l>
     <l n="134">They perceived no danger near them ,</l>
     <l n="135">Till their claws became entangled , 135</l>
     <l n="136">Till they found themselves imprisoned</l>
     <l n="137">In the snares of Hiawatha .</l>
     <l n="138">From his place of ambush came he ,</l>
     <l n="139">Striding terrible among them ,</l>
     <l n="140">And so awful was his aspect 140</l>
     <l n="141">That the bravest quailed with terror .</l>
     <l n="142">Without mercy he destroyed them</l>
     <l n="143">Right and left , by tens and twenties ,</l>
     <l n="144">And their wretched , lifeless bodies</l>
     <l n="145">Hung aloft on poles for scarecrows 145</l>
     <l n="146">Round the consecrated corn-fields ,</l>
     <l n="147">As a signal of his vengeance ,</l>
     <l n="148">As a warning to marauders .</l>
     <l n="149">Only Kahgahgee , the leader ,</l>
     <l n="150">Kahgahgee , the King of Ravens , 150</l>
     <l n="151">He alone was spared among them</l>
     <l n="152">As a hostage for his people .</l>
     <l n="153">With his prisoner-string he bound him ,</l>
     <l n="154">Led him captive to his wigwam ,</l>
     <l n="155">Tied him fast with cords of elm-bark 155</l>
     <l n="156">To the ridge-pole of his wigwam .</l>
     <l n="157">“ Kahgahgee , my raven ! ” said he ,</l>
     <l n="158">“ You the leader of the robbers ,</l>
     <l n="159">You the plotter of this mischief ,</l>

     <l n="194">And the merry Laughing Water 190</l>
     <l n="195">Went rejoicing from the wigwam ,</l>
     <l n="196">With Nokomis , old and wrinkled ,</l>
     <l n="197">And they called the women round them ,</l>
     <l n="198">Called the young men and the maidens ,</l>
     <l n="199">To the harvest of the corn-fields , 195</l>
     <l n="200">To the husking of the maize-ear .</l>
     <l n="201">On the border of the forest ,</l>
     <l n="202">Underneath the fragrant pine-trees ,</l>
     <l n="203">Sat the old men and the warriors</l>
     <l n="204">Smoking in the pleasant shadow . 200</l>
     <l n="205">In uninterrupted silence</l>
     <l n="206">Looked they at the gamesome labor</l>
     <l n="207">Of the young men and the women ;</l>
     <l n="208">Listened to their noisy talking ,</l>
     <l n="209">To their laughter and their singing , 205</l>
     <l n="210">Heard them chattering like the magpies ,</l>
     <l n="211">Heard them laughing like the blue-jays ,</l>
     <l n="212">Heard them singing like the robins .</l>
     <l n="213">And whene'er some lucky maiden</l>
     <l n="214">Found a red ear in the husking , 210</l>
     <l n="215">Found a maize-ear red as blood is ,</l>
     <l n="216">“ Nushka ! ” cried they all together ,</l>
     <l n="217">“ Nushka ! you shall have a sweetheart ,</l>
     <l n="218">You shall have a handsome husband ! ”</l>
     <l n="219">“ Ugh ! ” the old men all responded , 215</l>
     <l n="220">From their seats beneath the pine-trees .</l>
     <l n="221">And whene'er a youth or maiden</l>
     <l n="222">Found a crooked ear in husking ,</l>
     <l n="223">Found a maize-ear in the husking</l>
     <l n="224">Blighted , mildewed , or misshapen , 220</l>
     <l n="225">Then they laughed and sang together ,</l>
     <l n="226">Crept and limped about the corn-fields ,</l>
     <l n="227">Mimicked in their gait and gestures</l>
     <l n="228">Some old man , bent almost double ,</l>
     <l n="229">Singing singly or together : 225</l>
     <l n="230">“ Wagemin , the thief of corn-fields !</l>
     <l n="231">Paimosaid , the skulking robber ! ”</l>
     <l n="232">Till the corn-fields rang with laughter ,</l>
     <l n="233">Till from Hiawatha 's wigwam</l>
     <l n="234">Kahgahgee , the King of Ravens , 230</l>
     <l n="235">Screamed and quivered in his anger ,</l>
     <l n="236">And from all the neighboring tree-tops</l>
     <l n="237">Cawed and croaked the black marauders .</l>
     <l n="238">“ Ugh ! ” the old men all responded ,</l>
     <l n="239">From their seats beneath the pine-trees ! 235</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In those days said Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="2">“ Lo ! how all things fade and perish !</l>
     <l n="3">From the memory of the old men</l>
     <l n="4">Pass away the great traditions ,</l>
     <l n="5">The achievements of the warriors , 5</l>
     <l n="6">The adventures of the hunters ,</l>
     <l n="7">All the wisdom of the Medas ,</l>
     <l n="8">All the craft of the Wabenos ,</l>
     <l n="9">All the marvellous dreams and visions</l>
     <l n="10">Of the Jossakeeds , the Prophets ! 10</l>
     <l n="11">“ Great men die and are forgotten ,</l>
     <l n="12">Wise men speak ; their words of wisdom</l>
     <l n="13">Perish in the ears that hear them ,</l>
     <l n="14">Do not reach the generations</l>
     <l n="15">That , as yet unborn , are waiting 15</l>
     <l n="16">In the great , mysterious darkness</l>
     <l n="17">Of the speechless days that shall be !</l>
     <l n="18">“ On the grave-posts of our fathers</l>
     <l n="19">Are no signs , no figures painted ;</l>
     <l n="20">Who are in those graves we know not , 20</l>
     <l n="21">Only know they are our fathers .</l>
     <l n="22">Of what kith they are and kindred ,</l>
     <l n="23">From what old , ancestral Totem ,</l>
     <l n="24">Be it Eagle , Bear or Beaver ,</l>
     <l n="25">They descended , this we know not , 25</l>
     <l n="26">Only know they are our fathers .</l>
     <l n="27">“ Face to face we speak together ,</l>
     <l n="28">But we cannot speak when absent ,</l>
     <l n="29">Cannot send our voices from us</l>
     <l n="30">To the friends that dwell afar off ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">Cannot send a secret message ,</l>
     <l n="32">But the bearer learns our secret ,</l>
     <l n="33">May pervert it , may betray it ,</l>
     <l n="34">May reveal it unto others . ”</l>
     <l n="35">Thus said Hiawatha , walking 35</l>
     <l n="36">In the solitary forest ,</l>
     <l n="37">Pondering , musing in the forest ,</l>
     <l n="38">On the welfare of his people .</l>
     <l n="39">From his pouch he took his colors ,</l>
     <l n="40">Took his paints of different colors , 40</l>
     <l n="41">On the smooth bark of a birch-tree</l>
     <l n="42">Painted many shapes and figures ,</l>
     <l n="43">Wonderful and mystic figures ,</l>
     <l n="44">And each figure had a meaning ,</l>
     <l n="45">Each some word or thought suggested . 45</l>
     <l n="46">Gitche Manito the Mighty ,</l>
     <l n="47">He , the Master of Life , was painted</l>
     <l n="48">As an egg , with points projecting</l>
     <l n="49">To the four winds of the heavens .</l>
     <l n="50">Everywhere is the Great Spirit , 50</l>
     <l n="51">Was the meaning of this symbol .</l>
     <l n="52">Mitche Manito the Mighty ,</l>
     <l n="53">He the dreadful Spirit of Evil ,</l>
     <l n="54">As a serpent was depicted ,</l>
     <l n="55">As Kenabeek , the great serpent . 55</l>
     <l n="56">Very crafty , very cunning ,</l>
     <l n="57">Is the creeping Spirit of Evil ,</l>
     <l n="58">Was the meaning of this symbol .</l>
     <l n="59">Life and Death he drew as circles ,</l>
     <l n="60">Life was white , but Death was darkened ; 60</l>
     <l n="61">Sun and moon and stars he painted ,</l>
     <l n="62">Man and beast , and fish and reptile ,</l>
     <l n="63">Forests , mountains , lakes , and rivers .</l>
     <l n="64">For the earth he drew a straight line ,</l>
     <l n="65">For the sky a bow above it ; 65</l>
     <l n="66">White the space between for day-time ,</l>
     <l n="67">Filled with little stars for night-time ;</l>
     <l n="68">On the left a point for sunrise ,</l>
     <l n="69">On the right a point for sunset ,</l>
     <l n="70">On the top a point for noontide , 70</l>
     <l n="71">And for rain and cloudy weather</l>
     <l n="72">Waving lines descending from it .</l>
     <l n="73">Footprints pointing towards a wigwam</l>
     <l n="74">Were a sign of invitation ,</l>
     <l n="75">Were a sign of guests assembling ; 75</l>
     <l n="76">Bloody hands with palms uplifted</l>
     <l n="77">Were a symbol of destruction ,</l>
     <l n="78">Were a hostile sign and symbol .</l>
     <l n="79">All these things did Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="80">Show unto his wondering people , 80</l>
     <l n="81">And interpreted their meaning ,</l>
     <l n="82">And he said : “ Behold , your grave-posts</l>
     <l n="83">Have no mark , no sign , nor symbol .</l>
     <l n="84">Go and paint them all with figures ;</l>
     <l n="85">Each one with its household symbol , 85</l>
     <l n="86">With its own ancestral Totem ;</l>
     <l n="87">So that those who follow after</l>
     <l n="88">May distinguish them and know them . ”</l>
     <l n="89">And they painted on the grave-posts</l>
     <l n="90">On the graves yet unforgotten , 90</l>
     <l n="91">Each his own ancestral Totem ,</l>
     <l n="92">Each the symbol of his household ;</l>
     <l n="93">Figures of the Bear and Reindeer ,</l>
     <l n="94">Of the Turtle , Crane , and Beaver ,</l>
     <l n="95">Each inverted as a token 95</l>
     <l n="96">That the owner was departed ,</l>
     <l n="97">That the chief who bore the symbol</l>
     <l n="98">Lay beneath in dust and ashes .</l>
     <l n="99">And the Jossakeeds , the Prophets ,</l>
     <l n="100">The Wabenos , the Magicians , 100</l>
     <l n="101">And the Medicine-men , the Medas ,</l>
     <l n="102">Painted upon bark and deer-skin</l>
     <l n="103">Figures for the songs they chanted ,</l>
     <l n="104">For each song a separate symbol ,</l>
     <l n="105">Figures mystical and awful , 105</l>
     <l n="106">Figures strange and brightly colored ;</l>
     <l n="107">And each figure had its meaning ,</l>
     <l n="108">Each some magic song suggested .</l>
     <l n="109">The Great Spirit , the Creator ,</l>
     <l n="110">Flashing light through all the heaven ; 110</l>
     <l n="111">The Great Serpent , the Kenabeek ,</l>
     <l n="112">With his bloody crest erected ,</l>
     <l n="113">Creeping , looking into heaven ;</l>
     <l n="114">In the sky the sun , that glistens ,</l>
     <l n="115">And the moon eclipsed and dying ; 115</l>
     <l n="116">Owl and eagle , crane and hen-hawk ,</l>
     <l n="117">And the cormorant , bird of magic ;</l>
     <l n="118">Headless men , that walk the heavens ,</l>
     <l n="119">Bodies lying pierced with arrows ,</l>
     <l n="120">Bloody hands of death uplifted , 120</l>
     <l n="121">Flags on graves , and great war-captains</l>
     <l n="122">Grasping both the earth and heaven !</l>
     <l n="123">Such as these the shapes they painted</l>
     <l n="124">On the birch-bark and the deer-skin ;</l>
     <l n="125">Songs of war and songs of hunting , 125</l>
     <l n="126">Songs of medicine and of magic ,</l>
     <l n="127">All were written in these figures ,</l>
     <l n="128">For each figure had its meaning ,</l>
     <l n="129">Each its separate song recorded .</l>
     <l n="130">Nor forgotten was the Love-Song , 130</l>
     <l n="131">The most subtle of all medicines ,</l>
     <l n="132">The most potent spell of magic ,</l>
     <l n="133">Dangerous more than war or hunting !</l>
     <l n="134">Thus the Love-Song was recorded ,</l>
     <l n="135">Symbol and interpretation . 135</l>
     <l n="136">First a human figure standing ,</l>
     <l n="137">Painted in the brightest scarlet ;</l>
     <l n="138">‘ T is the lover , the musician ,</l>
     <l n="139">And the meaning is , “ My painting</l>
     <l n="140">Makes me powerful over others . ” 140</l>
     <l n="141">Then the figure seated , singing ,</l>
     <l n="142">Playing on a drum of magic ,</l>
     <l n="143">And the interpretation , “ Listen !</l>
     <l n="144">‘ T is my voice you hear , my singing ! ”</l>
     <l n="145">Then the same red figure seated 145</l>
     <l n="146">In the shelter of a wigwam ,</l>
     <l n="147">And the meaning of the symbol ,</l>
     <l n="148">“ I will come and sit beside you</l>
     <l n="149">In the mystery of my passion ! ”</l>
     <l n="150">Then two figures , man and woman , 150</l>
     <l n="151">Standing hand in hand together</l>
     <l n="152">With their hands so clasped together</l>
     <l n="153">That they seem in one united ,</l>
     <l n="154">And the words thus represented</l>
     <l n="155">Are , “ I see your heart within you , 155</l>
     <l n="156">And your cheeks are red with blushes ! ”</l>
     <l n="157">Next the maiden on an island ,</l>
     <l n="158">In the centre of an island ;</l>
     <l n="159">And the song this shape suggested</l>
     <l n="160">Was , “ Though you were at a distance , 160</l>
     <l n="161">Were upon some far-off island ,</l>
     <l n="162">Such the spell I cast upon you ,</l>
     <l n="163">Such the magic power of passion ,</l>
     <l n="164">I could straightway draw you to me ! ”</l>
     <l n="165">Then the figure of the maiden 165</l>
     <l n="166">Sleeping , and the lover near her ,</l>
     <l n="167">Whispering to her in her slumbers ,</l>
     <l n="168">Saying , “ Though you were far from me</l>
     <l n="169">In the land of Sleep and Silence ,</l>
     <l n="170">Still the voice of love would reach you ! ” 170</l>
     <l n="171">And the last of all the figures</l>
     <l n="172">Was a heart within a circle ,</l>
     <l n="173">Drawn within a magic circle ;</l>
     <l n="174">And the image had this meaning :</l>
     <l n="175">“ Naked lies your heart before me , 175</l>
     <l n="176">To your naked heart I whisper ! ”</l>
     <l n="177">Thus it was that Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="178">In his wisdom , taught the people</l>
     <l n="179">All the mysteries of painting ,</l>
     <l n="180">All the art of Picture-Writing , 180</l>
     <l n="181">On the smooth bark of the birch-tree ,</l>
     <l n="182">On the white skin of the reindeer ,</l>
     <l n="183">On the grave-posts of the village .</l>

    <head>HIAWATHA 'S LAMENTATION .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In those days the Evil Spirits ,</l>
     <l n="2">All the Manitos of mischief ,</l>
     <l n="3">Fearing Hiawatha 's wisdom ,</l>
     <l n="4">And his love for Chibiabos ,</l>
     <l n="5">Jealous of their faithful friendship , 5</l>
     <l n="6">And their noble words and actions ,</l>
     <l n="7">Made at length a league against them ,</l>
     <l n="8">To molest them and destroy them .</l>
     <l n="9">Hiawatha , wise and wary ,</l>
     <l n="10">Often said to Chibiabos , 10</l>
     <l n="11">“ O my brother ! do not leave me ,</l>
     <l n="12">Lest the Evil Spirits harm you ! ”</l>
     <l n="13">Chibiabos , young and heedless ,</l>
     <l n="14">Laughing shook his coal-black tresses ,</l>
     <l n="15">Answered ever sweet and childlike , 15</l>
     <l n="16">“ Do not fear for me , O brother !</l>
     <l n="17">Harm and evil come not near me ! ”</l>
     <l n="18">Once when Peboan , the Winter ,</l>
     <l n="19">Roofed with ice the Big-Sea-Water ,</l>
     <l n="20">When the snow-flakes , whirling downward , 20</l>
     <l n="21">Hissed among the withered oak-leaves ,</l>
     <l n="22">Changed the pine-trees into wigwams ,</l>
     <l n="23">Covered all the earth with silence ,—</l>
     <l n="24">Armed with arrows , shod with snow-shoes ,</l>
     <l n="25">Heeding not his brother 's warning , 25</l>
     <l n="26">Fearing not the Evil Spirits ,</l>
     <l n="27">Forth to hunt the deer with antlers</l>
     <l n="28">All alone went Chibiabos .</l>
     <l n="29">Right across the Big-Sea-Water</l>
     <l n="30">Sprang with speed the deer before him . 30</l>
     <l n="31">With the wind and snow he followed ,</l>
     <l n="32">O'er the treacherous ice he followed ,</l>
     <l n="33">Wild with all the fierce commotion</l>
     <l n="34">And the rapture of the hunting .</l>
     <l n="35">But beneath , the Evil Spirits 35</l>
     <l n="36">Lay in ambush , waiting for him ,</l>
     <l n="37">Broke the treacherous ice beneath him ,</l>
     <l n="38">Dragged him downward to the bottom ,</l>
     <l n="39">Buried in the sand his body .</l>
     <l n="40">Unktahee , the god of water , 40</l>
     <l n="41">He the god of the Dacotahs ,</l>
     <l n="42">Drowned him in the deep abysses</l>
     <l n="43">Of the lake of Gitche Gumee .</l>
     <l n="44">From the headlands Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="45">Sent forth such a wail of anguish , 45</l>
     <l n="46">Such a fearful lamentation ,</l>
     <l n="47">That the bison paused to listen ,</l>
     <l n="48">And the wolves howled from the prairies ,</l>
     <l n="49">And the thunder in the distance</l>
     <l n="50">Starting answered “ Baim-wawa ! ” 50</l>
     <l n="51">Then his face with black he painted ,</l>
     <l n="52">With his robe his head he covered ,</l>
     <l n="53">In his wigwam sat lamenting ,</l>
     <l n="54">Seven long weeks he sat lamenting ,</l>
     <l n="55">Uttering still this moan of sorrow :— 55</l>
     <l n="56">“ He is dead , the sweet musician !</l>
     <l n="57">He the sweetest of all singers !</l>
     <l n="58">He has gone from us forever ,</l>
     <l n="59">He has moved a little nearer</l>
     <l n="60">To the Master of all music , 60</l>
     <l n="61">To the Master of all singing !</l>
     <l n="62">O my brother , Chibiabos ! ”</l>
     <l n="63">And the melancholy fir-trees</l>
     <l n="64">Waved their dark green fans above him ,</l>
     <l n="65">Waved their purple cones above him , 65</l>
     <l n="66">Sighing with him to console him ,</l>
     <l n="67">Mingling with his lamentation</l>
     <l n="68">Their complaining , their lamenting .</l>
     <l n="69">Came the Spring , and all the forest</l>
     <l n="70">Looked in vain for Chibiabos ; 70</l>
     <l n="71">Sighed the rivulet , Sebowisha ,</l>
     <l n="72">Sighed the rushes in the meadow .</l>
     <l n="73">From the tree-tops sang the bluebird ,</l>
     <l n="74">Sang the bluebird , the Owaissa ,</l>
     <l n="75">“ Chibiabos ! Chibiabos ! 75</l>
     <l n="76">He is dead , the sweet musician ! ”</l>
     <l n="77">From the wigwam sang the robin ,</l>
     <l n="78">Sang the Opechee , the robin ,</l>
     <l n="79">“ Chibiabos ! Chibiabos !</l>
     <l n="80">He is dead , the sweetest singer ! ” 80</l>
     <l n="81">And at night through all the forest</l>
     <l n="82">Went the whippoorwill complaining ,</l>
     <l n="83">Wailing went the Wawonaissa ,</l>
     <l n="84">“ Chibiabos ! Chibiabos !</l>
     <l n="85">He is dead , the sweet musician ! 85</l>
     <l n="86">He the sweetest of all singers ! ”</l>

     <l n="186">Like a smoke-wreath wafted sideways ,</l>
     <l n="187">Slowly vanished Chibiabos !</l>
     <l n="188">Where he passed , the branches moved not ,</l>
     <l n="189">Where he trod , the grasses bent not</l>
     <l n="190">And the fallen leaves of last year 185</l>
     <l n="191">Made no sound beneath his footsteps .</l>
     <l n="192">Four whole days he journeyed onward</l>
     <l n="193">Down the pathway of the dead men ;</l>
     <l n="194">On the dead man 's strawberry feasted ,</l>
     <l n="195">Crossed the melancholy river , 190</l>
     <l n="196">On the swinging log he crossed it ,—</l>
     <l n="197">Came unto the Lake of Silver ,</l>
     <l n="198">In the Stone Canoe was carried</l>
     <l n="199">To the Islands of the Blessed ,</l>
     <l n="200">To the land of ghosts and shadows . 195</l>
     <l n="201">On that journey , moving slowly ,</l>
     <l n="202">Many weary spirits saw he ,</l>
     <l n="203">Panting under heavy burdens ,</l>
     <l n="204">Laden with war-clubs , bows and arrows ,</l>
     <l n="205">Robes of fur , and pots and kettles , 200</l>
     <l n="206">And with food that friends had given</l>
     <l n="207">For that solitary journey .</l>
     <l n="208">“ Ay ! why do the living , ” said they ,</l>
     <l n="209">“ Lay such heavy burdens on us !</l>
     <l n="210">Better were it to go naked , 205</l>
     <l n="211">Better were it to go fasting ,</l>
     <l n="212">Than to bear such heavy burdens</l>
     <l n="213">On our long and weary journey ! ”</l>
     <l n="214">Forth then issued Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="215">Wandered eastward , wandered westward , 210</l>
     <l n="216">Teaching men the use of simples</l>
     <l n="217">And the antidotes for poisons ,</l>
     <l n="218">And the cure of all diseases .</l>
     <l n="219">Thus was first made known to mortals</l>
     <l n="220">All the mystery of Medamin , 215</l>
     <l n="221">All the sacred art of healing .</l>

     <l n="2">He , the handsome Yenadizze ,</l>
     <l n="3">Whom the people called the Storm Fool ,</l>
     <l n="4">Vexed the village with disturbance .</l>
     <l n="5">You shall hear of all his mischief , 5</l>
     <l n="6">And his flight from Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="7">And his wondrous transmigrations ,</l>
     <l n="8">And the end of his adventures .</l>
     <l n="9">On the shores of Gitche Gumee ,</l>
     <l n="10">On the dunes of Nagow Wudjoo , 10</l>
     <l n="11">By the shining Big-Sea-Water</l>
     <l n="12">Stood the lodge of Pau-Puk-Keewis .</l>
     <l n="13">It was he who in his frenzy</l>
     <l n="14">Whirled these drifting sands together ,</l>
     <l n="15">On the dunes of Nagow Wudjoo , 15</l>
     <l n="16">When , among the guests assembled ,</l>
     <l n="17">He so merrily and madly</l>
     <l n="18">Danced at Hiawatha 's wedding ,</l>
     <l n="19">Danced the Beggar 's Dance to please them .</l>

     <l n="22">Came with speed into the village ,</l>
     <l n="23">Found the young men all assembled</l>
     <l n="24">In the lodge of old Iagoo ,</l>
     <l n="25">Listening to his monstrous stories , 25</l>
     <l n="26">To his wonderful adventures .</l>
     <l n="27">He was telling them the story</l>
     <l n="28">Of Ojeeg , the Summer-Maker ,</l>
     <l n="29">How he made a hole in heaven ,</l>
     <l n="30">How he climbed up into heaven , 30</l>
     <l n="31">And let out the summer-weather ,</l>
     <l n="32">The perpetual , pleasant Summer ;</l>
     <l n="33">How the Otter first essayed it ;</l>
     <l n="34">How the Beaver , Lynx , and Badger</l>
     <l n="35">Tried in turn the great achievement , 35</l>
     <l n="36">From the summit of the mountain</l>
     <l n="37">Smote their fists against the heavens ,</l>
     <l n="38">Smote against the sky their foreheads ,</l>
     <l n="39">Cracked the sky , but could not break it ;</l>
     <l n="40">How the Wolverine , uprising , 40</l>
     <l n="41">Made him ready for the encounter ,</l>
     <l n="42">Bent his knees down , like a squirrel ,</l>
     <l n="43">Drew his arms back , like a cricket .</l>
     <l n="44">“ Once he leaped , ” said old Iagoo ,</l>
     <l n="45">“ Once he leaped , and lo ! above him 45</l>
     <l n="46">Bent the sky , as ice in rivers</l>
     <l n="47">When the waters rise beneath it ;</l>
     <l n="48">Twice he leaped , and lo ! above him</l>
     <l n="49">Cracked the sky , as ice in rivers</l>
     <l n="50">When the freshet is at highest ! 50</l>
     <l n="51">Thrice he leaped , and lo ! above him</l>
     <l n="52">Broke the shattered sky asunder ,</l>
     <l n="53">And he disappeared within it ,</l>
     <l n="54">And Ojeeg , the Fisher Weasel ,</l>
     <l n="55">With a bound went in behind him ! ” 55</l>
     <l n="56">“ Hark you ! ” shouted Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
     <l n="57">As he entered at the doorway ;</l>
     <l n="58">“ I am tired of all this talking ,</l>
     <l n="59">Tired of old Iagoo 's stories ,</l>
     <l n="60">Tired of Hiawatha 's wisdom . 60</l>
     <l n="61">Here is something to amuse you ,</l>
     <l n="62">Better than this endless talking . ”</l>
     <l n="63">Then from out his pouch of wolf-skin</l>
     <l n="64">Forth he drew , with solemn manner ,</l>
     <l n="65">All the game of Bowl and Counters , 65</l>
     <l n="66">Pugasaing , with thirteen pieces .</l>
     <l n="67">White on one side were they painted ,</l>
     <l n="68">And vermilion on the other ;</l>
     <l n="69">Two Kenabeeks or great serpents ,</l>
     <l n="70">Two Ininewug or wedge-men , 70</l>
     <l n="71">One great war-club , Pugamaugun ,</l>
     <l n="72">And one slender fish , the Keego ,</l>
     <l n="73">Four round pieces , Ozawabeeks ,</l>
     <l n="74">And three Sheshebwug or ducklings .</l>
     <l n="75">All were made of bone and painted , 75</l>
     <l n="76">All except the Ozawabeeks ;</l>
     <l n="77">These were brass , on one side burnished ,</l>
     <l n="78">And were black upon the other .</l>
     <l n="79">In a wooden bowl he placed them ,</l>
     <l n="80">Shook and jostled them together , 80</l>
     <l n="81">Threw them on the ground before him ,</l>
     <l n="82">Thus exclaiming and explaining :</l>
     <l n="83">“ Red side up are all the pieces ,</l>
     <l n="84">And one great Kenabeek standing</l>
     <l n="85">On the bright side of a brass piece , 85</l>
     <l n="86">On a burnished Ozawabeek ;</l>
     <l n="87">Thirteen tens and eight are counted . ”</l>
     <l n="88">Then again he shook the pieces ,</l>
     <l n="89">Shook and jostled them together ,</l>
     <l n="90">Threw them on the ground before him , 90</l>
     <l n="91">Still exclaiming and explaining :</l>
     <l n="92">“ White are both the great Kenabeeks ,</l>
     <l n="93">White the Ininewug , the wedge-men ,</l>
     <l n="94">Red are all the other pieces ;</l>
     <l n="95">Five tens and an eight are counted . ” 95</l>
     <l n="96">Thus he taught the game of hazard ,</l>
     <l n="97">Thus displayed it and explained it ,</l>
     <l n="98">Running through its various chances ,</l>
     <l n="99">Various changes , various meanings :</l>
     <l n="100">Twenty curious eyes stared at him , 100</l>
     <l n="101">Full of eagerness stared at him .</l>
     <l n="102">“ Many games , ” said old Iagoo ,</l>
     <l n="103">“ Many games of skill and hazard</l>
     <l n="104">Have I seen in different nations ,</l>
     <l n="105">Have I played in different countries . 105</l>
     <l n="106">He who plays with old Iagoo</l>

     <l n="109">I can beat you , Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
     <l n="110">I can even give you lessons 110</l>

     <l n="140">‘ T was a youth of sixteen summers ,</l>

     <l n="142">Face-in-a-Mist , the people called him .</l>
     <l n="143">As the fire burns in a pipe-head</l>
     <l n="144">Dusky red beneath the ashes , 140</l>
     <l n="145">So beneath his shaggy eyebrows</l>

     <l n="147">“ Ugh ! ” he answered very fiercely ;</l>
     <l n="148">“ Ugh ! ” they answered all and each one .</l>
     <l n="149">Seized the wooden bowl the old man , 145</l>
     <l n="150">Closely in his bony fingers</l>
     <l n="151">Clutched the fatal bowl , Onagon ,</l>
     <l n="152">Shook it fiercely and with fury ,</l>
     <l n="153">Made the pieces ring together</l>
     <l n="154">As he threw them down before him . 150</l>

     <l n="173">Like the eyes of wolves glared at him ,</l>
     <l n="174">As he turned and left the wigwam , 170</l>
     <l n="175">Followed by his Meshinauwa ,</l>
     <l n="176">By the nephew of Iagoo ,</l>
     <l n="177">By the tall and graceful stripling ,</l>
     <l n="178">Bearing in his arms the winnings ,</l>
     <l n="179">Shirts of deer-skin , robes of ermine , 175</l>
     <l n="180">Belts of wampum , pipes and weapons .</l>
     <l n="181">“ Carry them , ” said Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
     <l n="182">Pointing with his fan of feathers ,</l>
     <l n="183">“ To my wigwam far to eastward ,</l>
     <l n="184">On the dunes of Nagow Wudjoo ! ” 180</l>
     <l n="185">Hot and red with smoke and gambling</l>
     <l n="186">Were the eyes of Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
     <l n="187">As he came forth to the freshness</l>
     <l n="188">Of the pleasant Summer morning .</l>
     <l n="189">All the birds were singing gayly , 185</l>
     <l n="190">All the streamlets flowing swiftly ,</l>
     <l n="191">And the heart of Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
     <l n="192">Sang with pleasure as the birds sing ,</l>
     <l n="193">Beat with triumph like the streamlets ,</l>
     <l n="194">As he wandered through the village , 190</l>
     <l n="195">In the early gray of morning ,</l>
     <l n="196">With his fan of turkey-feathers ,</l>
     <l n="197">With his plumes and tufts of swan 's down ,</l>
     <l n="198">Till he reached the farthest wigwam ,</l>
     <l n="199">Reached the lodge of Hiawatha . 195</l>
     <l n="200">Silent was it and deserted ;</l>
     <l n="201">No one met him at the doorway ,</l>
     <l n="202">No one came to bid him welcome ;</l>
     <l n="203">But the birds were singing round it ,</l>
     <l n="204">In and out and round the doorway , 200</l>
     <l n="205">Hopping , singing , fluttering , feeding ,</l>
     <l n="206">And aloft upon the ridge-pole</l>
     <l n="207">Kahgahgee , the King of Ravens ,</l>
     <l n="208">Sat with fiery eyes , and , screaming ,</l>
     <l n="209">Flapped his wings at Pau-Puk-Keewis . 205</l>
     <l n="210">“ All are gone ! the lodge is empty ! ”</l>
     <l n="211">Thus it was spake Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
     <l n="212">In his heart resolving mischief ;—</l>
     <l n="213">“ Gone is wary Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="214">Gone the silly Laughing Water , 210</l>
     <l n="215">Gone Nokomis , the old woman ,</l>
     <l n="216">And the lodge is left unguarded ! ”</l>
     <l n="217">By the neck he seized the raven ,</l>
     <l n="218">Whirled it round him like a rattle ,</l>
     <l n="219">Like a medicine-pouch he shook it , 215</l>
     <l n="220">Strangled Kahgahgee , the raven ,</l>
     <l n="221">From the ridge-pole of the wigwam</l>
     <l n="222">Left its lifeless body hanging ,</l>
     <l n="223">As an insult to its master ,</l>
     <l n="224">As a taunt to Hiawatha . 220</l>
     <l n="225">With a stealthy step he entered ,</l>
     <l n="226">Round the lodge in wild disorder</l>
     <l n="227">Threw the household things about him ,</l>
     <l n="228">Piled together in confusion</l>
     <l n="229">Bowls of wood and earthen kettles , 225</l>
     <l n="230">Robes of buffalo and beaver ,</l>
     <l n="231">Skins of otter , lynx , and ermine ,</l>
     <l n="232">As an insult to Nokomis ,</l>
     <l n="233">As a taunt to Minnehaha .</l>
     <l n="234">Then departed Pau-Puk-Keewis , 230</l>
     <l n="235">Whistling , singing through the forest ,</l>
     <l n="236">Whistling gayly to the squirrels ,</l>
     <l n="237">Who from hollow boughs above him</l>
     <l n="238">Dropped their acorn-shells upon him ,</l>
     <l n="239">Singing gayly to the wood-birds , 235</l>
     <l n="240">Who from out the leafy darkness</l>
     <l n="241">Answered with a song as merry .</l>
     <l n="242">Then he climbed the rocky headlands</l>
     <l n="243">Looking o'er the Gitche Gumee ,</l>
     <l n="244">Perched himself upon their summit , 240</l>
     <l n="245">Waiting full of mirth and mischief</l>
     <l n="246">The return of Hiawatha .</l>
     <l n="247">Stretched upon his back he lay there ;</l>
     <l n="248">Far below him plashed the waters ,</l>
     <l n="249">Plashed and washed the dreamy waters ; 245</l>
     <l n="250">Far above him swam the heavens ,</l>
     <l n="251">Swam the dizzy , dreamy heavens ;</l>
     <l n="252">Round him hovered , fluttered , rustled ,</l>
     <l n="253">Hiawatha 's mountain chickens ,</l>
     <l n="254">Flock-wise swept and wheeled about him , 250</l>
     <l n="255">Almost brushed him with their pinions .</l>
     <l n="256">And he killed them as he lay there ,</l>
     <l n="257">Slaughtered them by tens and twenties ,</l>
     <l n="258">Threw their bodies down the headland ,</l>
     <l n="259">Threw them on the beach below him , 255</l>
     <l n="260">Till at length Kayoshk , the sea-gull ,</l>
     <l n="261">Perched upon a crag above them ,</l>
     <l n="262">Shouted : “ It is Pau-Puk-Keewis !</l>
     <l n="263">He is slaying us by hundreds !</l>
     <l n="264">Send a message to our brother , 260</l>
     <l n="265">Tidings send to Hiawatha ! ”</l>

    <head>THE HUNTING OF PAU-PUK-KEEWIS .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Full of wrath was Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="2">When he came into the village ,</l>
     <l n="3">Found the people in confusion ,</l>
     <l n="4">Heard of all the misdemeanors ,</l>
     <l n="5">All the malice and the mischief , 5</l>
     <l n="6">Of the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis .</l>
     <l n="7">Hard his breath came through his nostrils ,</l>
     <l n="8">Through his teeth he buzzed and muttered</l>
     <l n="9">Words of anger and resentment ,</l>
     <l n="10">Hot and humming like a hornet . 10</l>
     <l n="11">“ I will slay this Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
     <l n="12">Slay this mischief-maker ! ” said he .</l>
     <l n="13">“ Not so long and wide the world is ,</l>
     <l n="14">Not so rude and rough the way is ,</l>
     <l n="15">That my wrath shall not attain him , 15</l>
     <l n="16">That my vengeance shall not reach him ! ”</l>
     <l n="17">Then in swift pursuit departed</l>
     <l n="18">Hiawatha and the hunters</l>
     <l n="19">On the trail of Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
     <l n="20">Through the forest , where he passed it , 20</l>
     <l n="21">To the headlands where he rested ;</l>
     <l n="22">But they found not Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
     <l n="23">Only in the trampled grasses ,</l>
     <l n="24">In the whortleberry-bushes ,</l>
     <l n="25">Found the couch where he had rested , 25</l>
     <l n="26">Found the impress of his body .</l>
     <l n="27">From the lowlands far beneath them ,</l>
     <l n="28">From the Muskoday , the meadow ,</l>
     <l n="29">Pau-Puk-Keewis , turning backward ,</l>
     <l n="30">Made a gesture of defiance , 30</l>
     <l n="31">Made a gesture of derision ;</l>
     <l n="32">And aloud cried Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="33">From the summit of the mountains :</l>
     <l n="34">“ Not so long and wide the world is ,</l>
     <l n="35">Not so rude and rough the way is , 35</l>
     <l n="36">But my wrath shall overtake you ,</l>
     <l n="37">And my vengeance shall attain you ! ”</l>
     <l n="38">Over rock and over river ,</l>
     <l n="39">Through the bush , and brake , and forest ,</l>
     <l n="40">Ran the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis ; 40</l>
     <l n="41">Like an antelope he bounded ,</l>
     <l n="42">Till he came unto a streamlet</l>
     <l n="43">In the middle of the forest ,</l>
     <l n="44">To a streamlet still and tranquil ,</l>
     <l n="45">That had overflowed its margin , 45</l>
     <l n="46">To a dam made by the beavers ,</l>
     <l n="47">To a pond of quiet water ,</l>
     <l n="48">Where knee-deep the trees were standing ,</l>
     <l n="49">Where the water-lilies floated ,</l>
     <l n="50">Where the rushes waved and whispered . 50</l>
     <l n="51">On the dam stood Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
     <l n="52">On the dam of trunks and branches ,</l>
     <l n="53">Through whose chinks the water spouted ,</l>
     <l n="54">O'er whose summit flowed the streamlet .</l>
     <l n="55">From the bottom rose the beaver , 55</l>
     <l n="56">Looked with two great eyes of wonder ,</l>
     <l n="57">Eyes that seemed to ask a question ,</l>
     <l n="58">At the stranger , Pau-Puk-Keewis .</l>
     <l n="59">On the dam stood Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
     <l n="60">O'er his ankles flowed the streamlet , 60</l>
     <l n="61">Flowed the bright and silvery water ,</l>
     <l n="62">And he spake unto the beaver ,</l>
     <l n="63">With a smile he spake in this wise :</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="68">“ O my friend Ahmeek , the beaver ,</l>
     <l n="69">Cool and pleasant is the water ; 65</l>
     <l n="70">Let me dive into the water ,</l>
     <l n="71">Let me rest there in your lodges ;</l>
     <l n="72">Change me , too , into a beaver ! ”</l>
     <l n="73">Cautiously replied the beaver ,</l>
     <l n="74">With reserve he thus made answer : 70</l>
     <l n="75">“ Let me first consult the others ,</l>
     <l n="76">Let me ask the other beavers . ”</l>
     <l n="77">Down he sank into the water ,</l>
     <l n="78">Heavily sank he , as a stone sinks ,</l>
     <l n="79">Down among the leaves and branches , 75</l>
     <l n="80">Brown and matted at the bottom .</l>
     <l n="81">On the dam stood Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
     <l n="82">O'er his ankles flowed the streamlet ,</l>
     <l n="83">Spouted through the chinks below him ,</l>
     <l n="84">Dashed upon the stones beneath him , 80</l>
     <l n="85">Spread serene and calm before him ,</l>
     <l n="86">And the sunshine and the shadows</l>
     <l n="87">Fell in flecks and gleams upon him ,</l>
     <l n="88">Fell in little shining patches ,</l>
     <l n="89">Through the waving , rustling branches . 85</l>
     <l n="90">From the bottom rose the beavers ,</l>
     <l n="91">Silently above the surface</l>
     <l n="92">Rose one head and then another ,</l>
     <l n="93">Till the pond seemed full of beavers ,</l>
     <l n="94">Full of black and shining faces . 90</l>
     <l n="95">To the beavers Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
     <l n="96">Spake entreating , said in this wise :</l>
     <l n="97">“ Very pleasant is your dwelling ,</l>
     <l n="98">O my friends ! and safe from danger ;</l>
     <l n="99">Can you not with all your cunning , 95</l>
     <l n="100">All your wisdom and contrivance ,</l>
     <l n="101">Change me , too , into a beaver ? ”</l>
     <l n="102">“ Yes ! ” replied Ahmeek , the beaver ,</l>
     <l n="103">He the King of all the beavers ,</l>
     <l n="104">“ Let yourself slide down among us , 100</l>
     <l n="105">Down into the tranquil water . ”</l>
     <l n="106">Down into the pond among them</l>
     <l n="107">Silently sank Pau-Puk-Keewis ;</l>
     <l n="108">Black became his shirt of deer-skin ,</l>
     <l n="109">Black his moccasins and leggins , 105</l>
     <l n="110">In a broad black tail behind him</l>
     <l n="111">Spread his fox-tails and his fringes ;</l>
     <l n="112">He was changed into a beaver .</l>
     <l n="113">“ Make me large , ” said Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
     <l n="114">“ Make me large and make me larger , 110</l>
     <l n="115">Larger than the other beavers . ”</l>
     <l n="116">“ Yes , ” the beaver chief responded ,</l>
     <l n="117">“ When our lodge below you enter ,</l>
     <l n="118">In our wigwam we will make you</l>
     <l n="119">Ten times larger than the others . ” 115</l>
     <l n="120">Thus into the clear brown water</l>
     <l n="121">Silently sank Pau-Puk-Keewis ;</l>
     <l n="122">Found the bottom covered over</l>
     <l n="123">With the trunks of trees and branches ,</l>
     <l n="124">Hoards of food against the winter , 120</l>
     <l n="125">Piles and heaps against the famine ,</l>
     <l n="126">Found the lodge with arching doorway ,</l>
     <l n="127">Leading into spacious chambers .</l>
     <l n="128">Here they made him large and larger ,</l>
     <l n="129">Made him largest of the beavers , 125</l>
     <l n="130">Ten times larger than the others .</l>
     <l n="131">“ You shall be our ruler , ” said they ;</l>
     <l n="132">“ Chief and king of all the beavers . ”</l>
     <l n="133">But not long had Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
     <l n="134">Sat in state among the beavers , 130</l>
     <l n="135">When there came a voice of warning</l>
     <l n="136">From the watchman at his station</l>
     <l n="137">In the water-flags and lilies ,</l>
     <l n="138">Saying , “ Here is Hiawatha !</l>
     <l n="139">Hiawatha with his hunters ! ” 135</l>
     <l n="140">Then they heard a cry above them ,</l>
     <l n="141">Heard a shouting and a tramping ,</l>
     <l n="142">Heard a crashing and a rushing ,</l>
     <l n="143">And the water round and o'er them</l>
     <l n="144">Sank and sucked away in eddies , 140</l>
     <l n="145">And they knew their dam was broken .</l>
     <l n="146">On the lodge 's roof the hunters</l>
     <l n="147">Leaped , and broke it all asunder ;</l>
     <l n="148">Streamed the sunshine through the crevice ,</l>
     <l n="149">Sprang the beavers through the doorway , 145</l>
     <l n="150">Hid themselves in deeper water ,</l>
     <l n="151">In the channel of the streamlet ;</l>
     <l n="152">But the mighty Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
     <l n="153">Could not pass beneath the doorway ;</l>
     <l n="154">He was puffed with pride and feeding , 150</l>
     <l n="155">He was swollen like a bladder .</l>
     <l n="156">Through the roof looked Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="157">Cried aloud , “ O Pau-Puk-Keewis !</l>
     <l n="158">Vain are all your craft and cunning ,</l>
     <l n="159">Vain your manifold disguises ! 155</l>
     <l n="160">Well I know you , Pau-Puk-Keewis ! ”</l>
     <l n="161">With their clubs they beat and bruised him ,</l>
     <l n="162">Beat to death poor Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
     <l n="163">Pounded him as maize is pounded ,</l>
     <l n="164">Till his skull was crushed to pieces . 160</l>
     <l n="165">Six tall hunters , lithe and limber ,</l>
     <l n="166">Bore him home on poles and branches ,</l>
     <l n="167">Bore the body of the beaver ;</l>
     <l n="168">But the ghost , the Jeebi in him ,</l>
     <l n="169">Thought and felt as Pau-Puk-Keewis , 165</l>
     <l n="170">Still lived on as Pau-Puk-Keewis .</l>
     <l n="171">And it fluttered , strove , and struggled ,</l>
     <l n="172">Waving hither , waving thither ,</l>
     <l n="173">As the curtains of a wigwam</l>
     <l n="174">Struggle with their thongs of deer-skin , 170</l>
     <l n="175">When the wintry wind is blowing ;</l>
     <l n="176">Till it drew itself together ,</l>
     <l n="177">Till it rose up from the body ,</l>
     <l n="178">Till it took the form and features</l>
     <l n="179">Of the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis 175</l>
     <l n="180">Vanishing into the forest .</l>
     <l n="181">But the wary Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="182">Saw the figure ere it vanished ,</l>
     <l n="183">Saw the form of Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
     <l n="184">Glide into the soft blue shadow 180</l>
     <l n="185">Of the pine-trees of the forest ;</l>
     <l n="186">Toward the squares of white beyond it ,</l>
     <l n="187">Toward an opening in the forest ,</l>
     <l n="188">Like a wind it rushed and panted ,</l>
     <l n="189">Bending all the boughs before it , 185</l>
     <l n="190">And behind it , as the rain comes ,</l>
     <l n="191">Came the steps of Hiawatha .</l>
     <l n="192">To a lake with many islands</l>
     <l n="193">Came the breathless Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
     <l n="194">Where among the water-lilies 190</l>
     <l n="195">Pishnekuh , the brant , were sailing ;</l>
     <l n="196">Through the tufts of rushes floating ,</l>
     <l n="197">Steering through the reedy islands .</l>
     <l n="198">Now their broad black beaks they lifted ,</l>
     <l n="199">Now they plunged beneath the water , 195</l>
     <l n="200">Now they darkened in the shadow ,</l>
     <l n="201">Now they brightened in the sunshine .</l>
     <l n="202">“ Pishnekuh ! ” cried Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
     <l n="203">“ Pishnekuh ! my brothers ! ” said he ,</l>
     <l n="204">“ Change me to a brant with plumage , 200</l>
     <l n="205">With a shining neck and feathers ,</l>
     <l n="206">Make me large , and make me larger ,</l>
     <l n="207">Ten times larger than the others . ”</l>
     <l n="208">Straightway to a brant they changed him ,</l>
     <l n="209">With two huge and dusky pinions , 205</l>
     <l n="210">With a bosom smooth and rounded ,</l>
     <l n="211">With a bill like two great paddles ,</l>
     <l n="212">Made him larger than the others ,</l>
     <l n="213">Ten times larger than the largest ,</l>
     <l n="214">Just as , shouting from the forest , 210</l>
     <l n="215">On the shore stood Hiawatha .</l>
     <l n="216">Up they rose with cry and clamor ,</l>
     <l n="217">With a whirr and beat of pinions ,</l>
     <l n="218">Rose up from the reedy islands ,</l>
     <l n="219">From the water-flags and lilies . 215</l>
     <l n="220">And they said to Pau-Puk-Keewis :</l>
     <l n="221">“ In your flying , look not downward ,</l>
     <l n="222">Take good heed , and look not downward ,</l>
     <l n="223">Lest some strange mischance should happen ,</l>
     <l n="224">Lest some great mishap befall you ! ” 220</l>
     <l n="225">Fast and far they fled to northward ,</l>
     <l n="226">Fast and far through mist and sunshine ,</l>
     <l n="227">Fed among the moors and fen-lands ,</l>
     <l n="228">Slept among the reeds and rushes .</l>
     <l n="229">On the morrow as they journeyed , 225</l>
     <l n="230">Buoyed and lifted by the South-wind ,</l>
     <l n="231">Wafted onward by the South-wind ,</l>
     <l n="232">Blowing fresh and strong behind them ,</l>
     <l n="233">Rose a sound of human voices</l>
     <l n="234">Rose a clamor from beneath them , 230</l>
     <l n="235">From the lodges of a village ,</l>
     <l n="236">From the people miles beneath them .</l>
     <l n="237">For the people of the village</l>
     <l n="238">Saw the flock of brant with wonder ,</l>
     <l n="239">Saw the wings of Pau-Puk-Keewis 235</l>
     <l n="240">Flapping far up in the ether ,</l>
     <l n="241">Broader than two doorway curtains .</l>
     <l n="242">Pau-Puk-Keewis heard the shouting ,</l>
     <l n="243">Knew the voice of Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="244">Knew the outcry of Iagoo , 240</l>
     <l n="245">And , forgetful of the warning ,</l>
     <l n="246">Drew his neck in , and looked downward ,</l>
     <l n="247">And the wind that blew behind him</l>
     <l n="248">Caught his mighty fan of feathers ,</l>
     <l n="249">Sent him wheeling , whirling downward ! 245</l>
     <l n="250">All in vain did Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
     <l n="251">Struggle to regain his balance !</l>
     <l n="252">Whirling round and round and downward ,</l>
     <l n="253">He beheld in turn the village</l>
     <l n="254">And in turn the flock above him , 250</l>
     <l n="255">Saw the village coming nearer ,</l>
     <l n="256">And the flock receding farther ,</l>
     <l n="257">Heard the voices growing louder ,</l>
     <l n="258">Heard the shouting and the laughter ;</l>
     <l n="259">Saw no more the flock above him , 255</l>
     <l n="260">Only saw the earth beneath him ;</l>
     <l n="261">Dead out of the empty heaven ,</l>
     <l n="262">Dead among the shouting people ,</l>
     <l n="263">With a heavy sound and sullen ,</l>
     <l n="264">Fell the brant with broken pinions . 260</l>
     <l n="265">But his soul , his ghost , his shadow ,</l>
     <l n="266">Still survived as Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
     <l n="267">Took again the form and features</l>
     <l n="268">Of the handsome Yenadizze ,</l>
     <l n="269">And again went rushing onward , 265</l>
     <l n="270">Followed fast by Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="271">Crying : “ Not so wide the world is ,</l>
     <l n="272">Not so long and rough the way is ,</l>
     <l n="273">But my wrath shall overtake you ,</l>
     <l n="274">But my vengeance shall attain you ! ” 270</l>
     <l n="275">And so near he came , so near him ,</l>
     <l n="276">That his hand was stretched to seize him ,</l>
     <l n="277">His right hand to seize and hold him ,</l>
     <l n="278">When the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis</l>
     <l n="279">Whirled and spun about in circles , 275</l>
     <l n="280">Fanned the air into a whirlwind ,</l>
     <l n="281">Danced the dust and leaves about him ,</l>
     <l n="282">And amid the whirling eddies</l>
     <l n="283">Sprang into a hollow oak-tree ,</l>
     <l n="284">Changed himself into a serpent , 280</l>
     <l n="285">Gliding out through root and rubbish .</l>
     <l n="286">With his right hand Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="287">Smote amain the hollow oak-tree ,</l>
     <l n="288">Rent it into shreds and splinters ,</l>
     <l n="289">Left it lying there in fragments . 285</l>
     <l n="290">But in vain ; for Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
     <l n="291">Once again in human figure ,</l>
     <l n="292">Full in sight ran on before him ,</l>
     <l n="293">Sped away in gust and whirlwind ,</l>
     <l n="294">On the shores of Gitche Gumee , 290</l>
     <l n="295">Westward by the Big-Sea-Water ,</l>
     <l n="296">Came unto the rocky headlands ,</l>
     <l n="297">To the Pictured Rocks of sandstone ,</l>
     <l n="298">Looking over lake and landscape .</l>
     <l n="299">And the Old Man of the Mountain , 295</l>
     <l n="300">He the Manito of Mountains ,</l>
     <l n="301">Opened wide his rocky doorways ,</l>
     <l n="302">Opened wide his deep abysses ,</l>
     <l n="303">Giving Pau-Puk-Keewis shelter</l>
     <l n="304">In his caverns dark and dreary , 300</l>
     <l n="305">Bidding Pau-Puk-Keewis welcome</l>
     <l n="306">To his gloomy lodge of sandstone .</l>
     <l n="307">There without stood Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="308">Found the doorways closed against him ,</l>
     <l n="309">With his mittens , Minjekahwun , 305</l>
     <l n="310">Smote great caverns in the sandstone ,</l>
     <l n="311">Cried aloud in tones of thunder ,</l>
     <l n="312">“ Open ! I am Hiawatha ! ”</l>
     <l n="313">But the Old Man of the Mountain</l>
     <l n="314">Opened not , and made no answer 310</l>
     <l n="315">From the silent crags of sandstone ,</l>
     <l n="316">From the gloomy rock abysses .</l>
     <l n="317">Then he raised his hands to heaven ,</l>
     <l n="318">Called imploring on the tempest ,</l>
     <l n="319">Called Waywassimo , the lightning , 315</l>
     <l n="320">And the thunder , Annemeekee ;</l>
     <l n="321">And they came with night and darkness ,</l>
     <l n="322">Sweeping down the Big-Sea-Water</l>
     <l n="323">From the distant Thunder Mountains ;</l>
     <l n="324">And the trembling Pau-Puk-Keewis 320</l>
     <l n="325">Heard the footsteps of the thunder ,</l>
     <l n="326">Saw the red eyes of the lightning ,</l>
     <l n="327">Was afraid , and crouched and trembled .</l>
     <l n="328">Then Waywassimo , the lightning ,</l>
     <l n="329">Smote the doorways of the caverns , 325</l>
     <l n="330">With his war-club smote the doorways ,</l>
     <l n="331">Smote the jutting crags of sandstone ,</l>
     <l n="332">And the thunder , Annemeekee ,</l>
     <l n="333">Shouted down into the caverns ,</l>
     <l n="334">Saying , “ Where is Pau-Puk-Keewis ! ” 330</l>
     <l n="335">And the crags fell , and beneath them</l>
     <l n="336">Dead among the rocky ruins</l>
     <l n="337">Lay the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
     <l n="338">Lay the handsome Yenadizze ,</l>
     <l n="339">Slain in his own human figure . 335</l>
     <l n="340">Ended were his wild adventures ,</l>
     <l n="341">Ended were his tricks and gambols ,</l>
     <l n="342">Ended all his craft and cunning ,</l>
     <l n="343">Ended all his mischief-making ,</l>
     <l n="344">All his gambling and his dancing , 340</l>
     <l n="345">All his wooing of the maidens .</l>
     <l n="346">Then the noble Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="347">Took his soul , his ghost , his shadow ,</l>
     <l n="348">Spake and said : “ O Pau-Puk-Keewis ,</l>
     <l n="349">Never more in human figure 345</l>
     <l n="350">Shall you search for new adventures ;</l>
     <l n="351">Never more with jest and laughter</l>
     <l n="352">Dance the dust and leaves in whirlwinds ;</l>
     <l n="353">But above there in the heavens</l>
     <l n="354">You shall soar and sail in circles ; 350</l>
     <l n="355">I will change you to an eagle ,</l>
     <l n="356">To Keneu , the great war-eagle ,</l>
     <l n="357">Chief of all the fowls with feathers ,</l>
     <l n="358">Chief of Hiawatha 's chickens . ”</l>
     <l n="359">And the name of Pau-Puk-Keewis 355</l>
     <l n="360">Lingers still among the people ,</l>
     <l n="361">Lingers still among the singers ,</l>
     <l n="362">And among the story-tellers ;</l>
     <l n="363">And in Winter , when the snow-flakes</l>
     <l n="364">Whirl in eddies round the lodges , 360</l>
     <l n="365">When the wind in gusty tumult</l>
     <l n="366">O'er the smoke-flue pipes and whistles ,</l>
     <l n="367">“ There , ” they cry , “ comes Pau-Puk-Keewis ;</l>

    <head>THE DEATH OF KWASIND .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Far and wide among the nations</l>
     <l n="2">Spread the name and fame of Kwasind ;</l>
     <l n="3">No man dared to strive with Kwasind ,</l>
     <l n="4">No man could compete with Kwasind .</l>
     <l n="5">But the mischievous Puk-Wudjies , 5</l>
     <l n="6">They the envious Little People ,</l>
     <l n="7">They the fairies and the pygmies ,</l>
     <l n="8">Plotted and conspired against him .</l>
     <l n="9">“ If this hateful Kwasind , ” said they ,</l>
     <l n="10">“ If this great , outrageous fellow 10</l>
     <l n="11">Goes on thus a little longer ,</l>
     <l n="12">Tearing everything he touches ,</l>
     <l n="13">Rending everything to pieces ,</l>
     <l n="14">Filling all the world with wonder ,</l>
     <l n="15">What becomes of the Puk-Wudjies ? 15</l>
     <l n="16">Who will care for the Puk-Wudjies ?</l>
     <l n="17">He will tread us down like mushrooms ,</l>
     <l n="18">Drive us all into the water ,</l>
     <l n="19">Give our bodies to be eaten</l>
     <l n="20">By the wicked Nee-ba-naw-baigs , 20</l>
     <l n="21">By the Spirits of the water ! ”</l>
     <l n="22">So the angry Little People</l>
     <l n="23">All conspired against the Strong Man ,</l>
     <l n="24">All conspired to murder Kwasind ,</l>
     <l n="25">Yes , to rid the world of Kwasind , 25</l>
     <l n="26">The audacious , overbearing ,</l>
     <l n="27">Heartless , haughty , dangerous Kwasind !</l>
     <l n="28">Now this wondrous strength of Kwasind</l>
     <l n="29">In his crown alone was seated ;</l>
     <l n="30">In his crown too was his weakness : 30</l>
     <l n="31">There alone could he be wounded ,</l>
     <l n="32">Nowhere else could weapon pierce him ,</l>
     <l n="33">Nowhere else could weapon harm him .</l>
     <l n="34">Even there the only weapon</l>
     <l n="35">That could wound him , that could slay him , 35</l>
     <l n="36">Was the seed-cone of the pine-tree ,</l>
     <l n="37">Was the blue cone of the fir-tree .</l>
     <l n="38">This was Kwasind 's fatal secret ,</l>
     <l n="39">Known to no man among mortals ;</l>
     <l n="40">But the cunning Little People , 40</l>
     <l n="41">The Puk-Wudjies , knew the secret ,</l>
     <l n="42">Knew the only way to kill him .</l>
     <l n="43">So they gathered cones together ,</l>
     <l n="44">Gathered seed-cones of the pine-tree ,</l>
     <l n="45">Gathered blue cones of the fir-tree , 45</l>
     <l n="46">In the woods by Taquamenaw ,</l>
     <l n="47">Brought them to the river 's margin ,</l>
     <l n="48">Heaped them in great piles together ,</l>
     <l n="49">Where the red rocks from the margin</l>
     <l n="50">Jutting overhang the river . 50</l>
     <l n="51">There they lay in wait for Kwasind ,</l>
     <l n="52">The malicious Little People .</l>
     <l n="53">‘ T was an afternoon in Summer ;</l>
     <l n="54">Very hot and still the air was ,</l>
     <l n="55">Very smooth the gliding river , 55</l>
     <l n="56">Motionless the sleeping shadows :</l>
     <l n="57">Insects glistened in the sunshine ,</l>
     <l n="58">Insects skated on the water</l>
     <l n="59">Filled the drowsy air with buzzing ,</l>
     <l n="60">With a far-resounding war-cry . 60</l>
     <l n="61">Down the river came the Strong Man ,</l>
     <l n="62">In his birch canoe came Kwasind ,</l>
     <l n="63">Floating slowly down the current</l>
     <l n="64">Of the sluggish Taquamenaw ,</l>
     <l n="65">Very languid with the weather , 65</l>
     <l n="66">Very sleepy with the silence .</l>
     <l n="67">From the overhanging branches ,</l>
     <l n="68">From the tassels of the birch-trees ,</l>
     <l n="69">Soft the Spirit of Sleep descended ;</l>
     <l n="70">By his airy hosts surrounded , 70</l>
     <l n="71">His invisible attendants ,</l>
     <l n="72">Came the Spirit of Sleep , Nepahwin ;</l>
     <l n="73">Like the burnished Dush-kwo-ne-she ,</l>
     <l n="74">Like a dragon fly , he hovered</l>
     <l n="75">O'er the drowsy head of Kwasind . 75</l>
     <l n="76">To his ear there came a murmur</l>
     <l n="77">As of waves upon a sea-shore ,</l>
     <l n="78">As of far-off tumbling waters ,</l>
     <l n="79">As of winds among the pine-trees ;</l>
     <l n="80">And he felt upon his forehead 80</l>
     <l n="81">Blows of little airy war-clubs ,</l>
     <l n="82">Wielded by the slumbrous legions</l>
     <l n="83">Of the Spirit of Sleep , Nepahwin ,</l>
     <l n="84">As of some one breathing on him .</l>
     <l n="85">At the first blow of their war-clubs , 85</l>
     <l n="86">Fell a drowsiness on Kwasind ;</l>
     <l n="87">At the second blow they smote him ,</l>
     <l n="88">Motionless his paddle rested ;</l>
     <l n="89">At the third , before his vision</l>
     <l n="90">Reeled the landscape into darkness , 90</l>
     <l n="91">Very sound asleep was Kwasind .</l>
     <l n="92">So he floated down the river ,</l>
     <l n="93">Like a blind man seated upright ,</l>
     <l n="94">Floated down the Taquamenaw ,</l>
     <l n="95">Underneath the trembling birch-trees , 95</l>
     <l n="96">Underneath the wooded headlands ,</l>
     <l n="97">Underneath the war encampment</l>
     <l n="98">Of the pygmies , the Puk-Wudjies .</l>
     <l n="99">There they stood , all armed and waiting ,</l>
     <l n="100">Hurled the pine-cones down upon him , 100</l>
     <l n="101">Struck him on his brawny shoulders ,</l>
     <l n="102">On his crown defenseless struck him .</l>
     <l n="103">“ Death to Kwasind ! ” was the sudden</l>
     <l n="104">War-cry of the Little People .</l>
     <l n="105">And he sideways swayed and tumbled , 105</l>
     <l n="106">Sideways fell into the river ,</l>
     <l n="107">Plunged beneath the sluggish water</l>
     <l n="108">Headlong , as an otter plunges ;</l>
     <l n="109">And the birch canoe , abandoned ,</l>
     <l n="110">Drifted empty down the river , 110</l>
     <l n="111">Bottom upward swerved and drifted :</l>
     <l n="112">Nothing more was seen of Kwasind .</l>

     <l n="1">Never stoops the soaring vulture</l>
     <l n="2">On his quarry in the desert ,</l>
     <l n="3">On the sick or wounded bison ,</l>
     <l n="4">But another vulture , watching</l>
     <l n="5">From his high aerial look-out , 5</l>
     <l n="6">Sees the downward plunge , and follows ;</l>
     <l n="7">And a third pursues the second ,</l>
     <l n="8">Coming from the invisible ether ,</l>
     <l n="9">First a speck , and then a vulture ,</l>

     <l n="11">So disasters come not singly ;</l>
     <l n="12">But as if they watched and waited ,</l>

     <l n="15">Follow , follow , gathering flock-wise 15</l>
     <l n="16">Round their victim , sick and wounded ,</l>
     <l n="17">First a shadow , then a sorrow ,</l>
     <l n="18">Till the air is dark with anguish .</l>

     <l n="20">Mighty Peboan , the Winter , 20</l>
     <l n="21">Breathing on the lakes and rivers ,</l>
     <l n="22">Into stone had changed their waters .</l>

     <l n="27">With his hand had smoothed them over .</l>
     <l n="28">Through the forest , wide and wailing ,</l>
     <l n="29">Roamed the hunter on his snow-shoes ;</l>
     <l n="30">In the village worked the women , 30</l>
     <l n="31">Pounded maize , or dressed the deer-skin ;</l>
     <l n="32">And the young men played together</l>
     <l n="33">On the ice the noisy ball-play ,</l>
     <l n="34">On the plain the dance of snow-shoes .</l>
     <l n="35">One dark evening , after sundown , 35</l>
     <l n="36">In her wigwam Laughing Water</l>
     <l n="37">Sat with old Nokomis , waiting</l>
     <l n="38">For the steps of Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="39">Homeward from the hunt returning .</l>
     <l n="40">On their faces gleamed the fire-light , 40</l>
     <l n="41">Painting them with streaks of crimson ,</l>
     <l n="42">In the eyes of old Nokomis</l>
     <l n="43">Glimmered like the watery moonlight ,</l>
     <l n="44">In the eyes of Laughing Water</l>
     <l n="45">Glistened like the sun in water ; 45</l>
     <l n="46">And behind them crouched their shadows</l>
     <l n="47">In the corners of the wigwam ,</l>
     <l n="48">And the smoke in wreaths above them</l>
     <l n="49">Climbed and crowded through the smoke-flue .</l>
     <l n="50">Then the curtain of the doorway 50</l>
     <l n="51">From without was slowly lifted ;</l>
     <l n="52">Brighter glowed the fire a moment ,</l>
     <l n="53">And a moment swerved the smoke-wreath ,</l>
     <l n="54">As two women entered softly ,</l>
     <l n="55">Passed the doorway uninvited , 55</l>
     <l n="56">Without word of salutation ,</l>
     <l n="57">Without sign of recognition ,</l>
     <l n="58">Sat down in the farthest corner ,</l>
     <l n="59">Crouching low among the shadows .</l>
     <l n="60">From their aspect and their garments , 60</l>
     <l n="61">Strangers seemed they in the village ;</l>
     <l n="62">Very pale and haggard were they ,</l>
     <l n="63">As they sat there sad and silent ,</l>
     <l n="64">Trembling , cowering with the shadows .</l>
     <l n="65">Was it the wind above the smoke-flue , 65</l>
     <l n="66">Muttering down into the wigwam ?</l>
     <l n="67">Was it the owl , the Koko-koho ,</l>
     <l n="68">Hooting from the dismal forest ?</l>
     <l n="69">Sure a voice said in the silence :</l>
     <l n="70">“ These are corpses clad in garments , 70</l>
     <l n="71">These are ghosts that come to haunt you ,</l>
     <l n="72">From the kingdom of Ponemah ,</l>
     <l n="73">From the land of the Hereafter ! ”</l>
     <l n="74">Homeward now came Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="75">From his hunting in the forest , 75</l>
     <l n="76">With the snow upon his tresses ,</l>
     <l n="77">And the red deer on his shoulders .</l>
     <l n="78">At the feet of Laughing Water</l>
     <l n="79">Down he threw his lifeless burden ;</l>
     <l n="80">Nobler , handsomer she thought him , 80</l>
     <l n="81">Than when first he came to woo her ,</l>
     <l n="82">First threw down the deer before her ,</l>
     <l n="83">As a token of his wishes ,</l>
     <l n="84">As a promise of the future .</l>
     <l n="85">Then he turned and saw the strangers , 85</l>
     <l n="86">Cowering , crouching with the shadows ;</l>
     <l n="87">Said within himself , “ Who are they ?</l>
     <l n="88">What strange guests has Minnehaha ? ”</l>
     <l n="89">But he questioned not the strangers ,</l>
     <l n="90">Only spake to bid them welcome 90</l>
     <l n="91">To his lodge , his food , his fireside .</l>
     <l n="92">When the evening meal was ready ,</l>
     <l n="93">And the deer had been divided ,</l>
     <l n="94">Both the pallid guests , the strangers ,</l>
     <l n="95">Springing from among the shadows , 95</l>
     <l n="96">Seized upon the choicest portions ,</l>
     <l n="97">Seized the white fat of the roebuck ,</l>
     <l n="98">Set apart for Laughing Water ,</l>
     <l n="99">For the wife of Hiawatha ;</l>
     <l n="100">Without asking , without thanking , 100</l>
     <l n="101">Eagerly devoured the morsels ,</l>
     <l n="102">Flitted back among the shadows</l>
     <l n="103">In the corner of the wigwam .</l>
     <l n="104">Not a word spake Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="105">Not a motion made Nokomis , 105</l>
     <l n="106">Not a gesture Laughing Water ;</l>
     <l n="107">Not a change came o'er their features ;</l>
     <l n="108">Only Minnehaha softly</l>
     <l n="109">Whispered , saying , “ They are famished ;</l>
     <l n="110">Let them do what best delights them ; 110</l>
     <l n="111">Let them eat , for they are famished . ”</l>
     <l n="112">Many a daylight dawned and darkened ,</l>
     <l n="113">Many a night shook off the daylight</l>
     <l n="114">As the pine shakes off the snow-flakes</l>
     <l n="115">From the midnight of its branches ; 115</l>
     <l n="116">Day by day the guests unmoving</l>
     <l n="117">Sat there silent in the wigwam ;</l>
     <l n="118">But by night , in storm or starlight ,</l>
     <l n="119">Forth they went into the forest ,</l>
     <l n="120">Bringing fire-wood to the wigwam , 120</l>
     <l n="121">Bringing pine-cones for the burning ,</l>
     <l n="122">Always sad and always silent .</l>
     <l n="123">And whenever Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="124">Came from fishing or from hunting ,</l>
     <l n="125">When the evening meal was ready , 125</l>
     <l n="126">And the food had been divided ,</l>
     <l n="127">Gliding from their darksome corner ,</l>
     <l n="128">Came the pallid guests , the strangers ,</l>
     <l n="129">Seized upon the choicest portions</l>
     <l n="130">Set aside for Laughing Water , 130</l>
     <l n="131">And without rebuke or question</l>
     <l n="132">Flitted back among the shadows .</l>
     <l n="133">Never once had Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="134">By a word or look reproved them ;</l>
     <l n="135">Never once had old Nokomis 135</l>
     <l n="136">Made a gesture of impatience ;</l>
     <l n="137">Never once had Laughing Water</l>
     <l n="138">Shown resentment at the outrage .</l>
     <l n="139">All had they endured in silence ,</l>
     <l n="140">That the rights of guest and stranger , 140</l>
     <l n="141">That the virtue of free-giving ,</l>
     <l n="142">By a look might not be lessened ,</l>
     <l n="143">By a word might not be broken .</l>
     <l n="144">Once at midnight Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="145">Ever wakeful , ever watchful , 145</l>
     <l n="146">In the wigwam , dimly lighted</l>
     <l n="147">By the brands that still were burning ,</l>
     <l n="148">By the glimmering , flickering fire-light ,</l>
     <l n="149">Heard a sighing , oft repeated ,</l>
     <l n="150">Heard a sobbing as of sorrow . 150</l>
     <l n="151">From his couch rose Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="152">From his shaggy hides of bison ,</l>
     <l n="153">Pushed aside the deer-skin curtain ,</l>
     <l n="154">Saw the pallid guests , the shadows ,</l>
     <l n="155">Sitting upright on their couches , 155</l>
     <l n="156">Weeping in the silent midnight .</l>
     <l n="157">And he said : “ O guests ! why is it</l>
     <l n="158">That your hearts are so afflicted ,</l>
     <l n="159">That you sob so in the midnight ?</l>
     <l n="160">Has perchance the old Nokomis , 160</l>
     <l n="161">Has my wife , my Minnehaha ,</l>
     <l n="162">Wronged or grieved you by unkindness ,</l>
     <l n="163">Failed in hospitable duties ? ”</l>

     <l n="1">O the long and dreary Winter !</l>
     <l n="2">O the cold and cruel Winter !</l>
     <l n="3">Ever thicker , thicker , thicker</l>
     <l n="4">Froze the ice on lake and river ,</l>
     <l n="5">Ever deeper , deeper , deeper , 5</l>
     <l n="6">Fell the snow o'er all the landscape ,</l>
     <l n="7">Fell the covering snow , and drifted</l>
     <l n="8">Through the forest , round the village .</l>
     <l n="9">Hardly from his buried wigwam</l>
     <l n="10">Could the hunter force a passage ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">With his mittens and his snow-shoes</l>
     <l n="12">Vainly walked he through the forest ,</l>
     <l n="13">Sought for bird or beast and found none .</l>
     <l n="14">Saw no track of deer or rabbit ,</l>
     <l n="15">In the snow beheld no footprints , 15</l>
     <l n="16">In the ghastly , gleaming forest</l>
     <l n="17">Fell , and could not rise from weakness ,</l>
     <l n="18">Perished there from cold and hunger .</l>
     <l n="19">O the famine and the fever !</l>
     <l n="20">O the wasting of the famine ! 20</l>
     <l n="21">O the blasting of the fever !</l>
     <l n="22">O the wailing of the children !</l>
     <l n="23">O the anguish of the women !</l>
     <l n="24">All the earth was sick and famished ;</l>
     <l n="25">Hungry was the air around them , 25</l>
     <l n="26">Hungry was the sky above them ,</l>
     <l n="27">And the hungry stars in heaven</l>
     <l n="28">Like the eyes of wolves glared at them !</l>
     <l n="29">Into Hiawatha 's wigwam</l>
     <l n="30">Came two other guests as silent 30</l>
     <l n="31">As the ghosts were , and as gloomy ,</l>
     <l n="32">Waited not to be invited ,</l>
     <l n="33">Did not parley at the doorway ,</l>
     <l n="34">Sat there without word of welcome</l>
     <l n="35">In the seat of Laughing Water ; 35</l>
     <l n="36">Looked with haggard eyes and hollow</l>
     <l n="37">At the face of Laughing Water .</l>
     <l n="38">And the foremost said : “ Behold me !</l>
     <l n="39">I am Famine , Bukadawin ! ”</l>
     <l n="40">And the other said : “ Behold me ! 40</l>
     <l n="41">I am Fever , Ahkosewin ! ”</l>
     <l n="42">And the lovely Minnehaha</l>
     <l n="43">Shuddered as they looked upon her ,</l>
     <l n="44">Shuddered at the words they uttered ,</l>
     <l n="45">Lay down on her bed in silence , 45</l>
     <l n="46">Hid her face , but made no answer ;</l>
     <l n="47">Lay there trembling , freezing , burning</l>
     <l n="48">At the looks they cast upon her ,</l>
     <l n="49">At the fearful words they uttered .</l>
     <l n="50">Forth into the empty forest 50</l>
     <l n="51">Rushed the maddened Hiawatha ;</l>
     <l n="52">In his heart was deadly sorrow ,</l>
     <l n="53">In his face a stony firmness ;</l>
     <l n="54">On his brow the sweat of anguish</l>
     <l n="55">Started , but it froze and fell not . 55</l>
     <l n="56">Wrapped in furs and armed for hunting ,</l>
     <l n="57">With his mighty bow of ash-tree ,</l>
     <l n="58">With his quiver full of arrows ,</l>
     <l n="59">With his mittens , Minjekahwun ,</l>
     <l n="60">Into the vast and vacant forest 60</l>
     <l n="61">On his snow-shoes strode he forward .</l>
     <l n="62">“ Gitche Manito , the Mighty ! ”</l>
     <l n="63">Cried he with his face uplifted</l>
     <l n="64">In that bitter hour of anguish ,</l>
     <l n="65">“ Give your children food , O father ! 65</l>
     <l n="66">Give us food , or we must perish !</l>
     <l n="67">Give me food for Minnehaha ,</l>

     <l n="69">Through the far-resounding forest ,</l>
     <l n="70">Through the forest vast and vacant 70</l>
     <l n="71">Rang that cry of desolation ,</l>
     <l n="72">But there came no other answer</l>
     <l n="73">Than the echo of his crying ,</l>
     <l n="74">Than the echo of the woodlands ,</l>
     <l n="75">“ Minnehaha ! Minnehaha ! ” 75</l>
     <l n="76">All day long roved Hiawatha</l>
     <l n="77">In that melancholy forest ,</l>

     <l n="80">Of that ne'er forgotten Summer , 80</l>
     <l n="81">He had brought his young wife homeward</l>

     <l n="86">And the lovely Laughing Water</l>
     <l n="87">Said with voice that did not tremble ,</l>
     <l n="88">“ I will follow you , my husband ! ”</l>
     <l n="89">In the wigwam with Nokomis ,</l>
     <l n="90">With those gloomy guests that watched her , 90</l>
     <l n="91">With the Famine and the Fever ,</l>
     <l n="92">She was lying , the Beloved ,</l>
     <l n="93">She the dying Minnehaha .</l>
     <l n="94">“ Hark ! ” she said ; “ I hear a rushing ,</l>
     <l n="95">Hear a roaring and a rushing , 95</l>
     <l n="96">Hear the Falls of Minnehaha</l>
     <l n="97">Calling to me from a distance ! ”</l>
     <l n="98">“ No , my child ! ” said old Nokomis ,</l>
     <l n="99">“ ‘ T is the night-wind in the pine-trees ! ”</l>
     <l n="100">“ Look ! ” she said ; “ I see my father 100</l>
     <l n="101">Standing lonely at his doorway ,</l>
     <l n="102">Beckoning to me from his wigwam</l>
     <l n="103">In the land of the Dacotahs ! ”</l>
     <l n="104">“ No , my child ! ” said old Nokomis ,</l>
     <l n="105">“ ‘ T is the smoke , that waves and beckons ! ” 105</l>
     <l n="106">“ Ah ! ” said she , “ the eyes of Pauguk</l>
     <l n="107">Glare upon me in the darkness ,</l>
     <l n="108">I can feel his icy fingers</l>

     <l n="110">Hiawatha ! Hiawatha ! ” 110</l>
     <l n="111">And the desolate Hiawatha ,</l>
     <l n="112">Far away amid the forest ,</l>
     <l n="113">Miles away among the mountains ,</l>
     <l n="114">Heard that sudden cry of anguish ,</l>
     <l n="115">Heard the voice of Minnehaha 115</l>
     <l n="116">Calling to him in the darkness ,</l>
     <l n="117">“ Hiawatha ! Hiawatha ! ”</l>
     <l n="118">Over snow-fields waste and pathless ,</l>
     <l n="119">Under snow-encumbered branches ,</l>
     <l n="120">Homeward hurried Hiawatha , 120</l>
     <l n="121">Empty-handed , heavy-hearted ,</l>
     <l n="122">Heard Nokomis moaning , wailing :</l>
     <l n="123">“ Wahonowin ! Wahonowin !</l>
     <l n="124">Would that I had perished for you ,</l>
     <l n="125">Would that I were dead as you are ! 125</l>
     <l n="126">Wahonowin ! Wahonowin ! ”</l>
     <l n="127">And he rushed into the wigwam ,</l>
     <l n="128">Saw the old Nokomis slowly</l>
     <l n="129">Rocking to and fro and moaning ,</l>
     <l n="130">Saw his lovely Minnehaha 130</l>
     <l n="131">Lying dead and cold before him ,</l>
     <l n="132">And his bursting heart within him</l>
     <l n="133">Uttered such a cry of anguish ,</l>
     <l n="134">That the forest moaned and shuddered ,</l>
     <l n="135">That the very stars in heaven 135</l>
     <l n="136">Shook and trembled with his anguish .</l>
     <l n="137">Then he sat down , still and speechless ,</l>
     <l n="138">On the bed of Minnehaha ,</l>
     <l n="139">At the feet of Laughing Water ,</l>
     <l n="140">At those willing feet , that never 140</l>
     <l n="141">More would lightly run to meet him ,</l>
     <l n="142">Never more would lightly follow .</l>
     <l n="143">With both hands his face he covered ,</l>
     <l n="144">Seven long days and nights he sat there ,</l>
     <l n="145">As if in a swoon he sat there , 145</l>
     <l n="146">Speechless , motionless , unconscious</l>
     <l n="147">Of the daylight or the darkness .</l>
     <l n="148">Then they buried Minnehaha ;</l>
     <l n="149">In the snow a grave they made her ,</l>
     <l n="150">In the forest deep and darksome , 150</l>
     <l n="151">Underneath the moaning hemlocks ;</l>
     <l n="152">Clothed her in her richest garments ,</l>
     <l n="153">Wrapped her in her robes of ermine ,</l>
     <l n="154">Covered her with snow , like ermine ;</l>
     <l n="155">Thus they buried Minnehaha . 155</l>
     <l n="156">And at night a fire was lighted ,</l>
     <l n="157">On her grave four times was kindled ,</l>
     <l n="158">For her soul upon its journey</l>
     <l n="159">To the Islands of the Blessed .</l>
     <l n="160">From his doorway Hiawatha 160</l>
     <l n="161">Saw it burning in the forest ,</l>
     <l n="162">Lighting up the gloomy hemlocks ;</l>
     <l n="163">From his sleepless bed uprising ,</l>
     <l n="164">From the bed of Minnehaha ,</l>
     <l n="165">Stood and watched it at the doorway , 165</l>
     <l n="166">That it might not be extinguished ,</l>
     <l n="167">Might not leave her in the darkness .</l>
     <l n="168">“ Farewell ! ” said he , “ Minnehaha !</l>
     <l n="169">Farewell , O my Laughing Water !</l>
     <l n="170">All my heart is buried with you , 170</l>
     <l n="171">All my thoughts go onward with you !</l>
     <l n="172">Come not back again to labor ,</l>
     <l n="173">Come not back again to suffer ,</l>
     <l n="174">Where the Famine and the Fever</l>
     <l n="175">Wear the heart and waste the body . 175</l>
     <l n="176">Soon my task will be completed ,</l>
     <l n="177">Soon your footsteps I shall follow</l>
     <l n="178">To the Islands of the Blessed ,</l>
     <l n="179">To the Kingdom of Ponemah ,</l>
     <l n="180">To the Land of the Hereafter ! ” 180</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In his lodge beside a river ,</l>
     <l n="2">Close beside a frozen river ,</l>
     <l n="3">Sat an old man , sad and lonely .</l>
     <l n="4">White his hair was as a snow-drift ;</l>
     <l n="5">Dull and low his fire was burning , 5</l>
     <l n="6">And the old man shook and trembled ,</l>
     <l n="7">Folded in his Waubewyon ,</l>
     <l n="8">In his tattered white-skin-wrapper ,</l>
     <l n="9">Hearing nothing but the tempest</l>
     <l n="10">As it roared along the forest , 10</l>
     <l n="11">Seeing nothing but the snow-storm ,</l>
     <l n="12">As it whirled and hissed and drifted .</l>
     <l n="13">All the coals were white with ashes ,</l>
     <l n="14">And the fire was slowly dying ,</l>
     <l n="15">As a young man , walking lightly , 15</l>
     <l n="16">At the open doorway entered .</l>
     <l n="17">Red with blood of youth his cheeks were ,</l>
     <l n="18">Soft his eyes , as stars in Spring-time ,</l>
     <l n="19">Bound his forehead was with grasses ,</l>
     <l n="20">Bound and plumed with scented grasses ; 20</l>
     <l n="21">On his lips a smile of beauty ,</l>
     <l n="22">Filling all the lodge with sunshine ,</l>
     <l n="23">In his hand a bunch of blossoms</l>
     <l n="24">Filling all the lodge with sweetness .</l>
     <l n="25">“ Ah , my son ! ” exclaimed the old man , 25</l>
     <l n="26">“ Happy are my eyes to see you .</l>
     <l n="27">Sit here on the mat beside me ,</l>
     <l n="28">Sit here by the dying embers ,</l>
     <l n="29">Let us pass the night together .</l>
     <l n="30">Tell me of your strange adventures , 30</l>
     <l n="31">Of the lands where you have travelled ;</l>
     <l n="32">I will tell you of my prowess ,</l>
     <l n="33">Of my many deeds of wonder . ”</l>
     <l n="34">From his pouch he drew his peace-pipe ,</l>
     <l n="35">Very old and strangely fashioned ; 35</l>
     <l n="36">Made of red stone was the pipe-head ,</l>
     <l n="37">And the stem a reed with feathers ;</l>
     <l n="38">Filled the pipe with bark of willow ,</l>
     <l n="39">Placed a burning coal upon it ,</l>
     <l n="40">Gave it to his guest , the stranger , 40</l>
     <l n="41">And began to speak in this wise :</l>
     <l n="42">“ When I blow my breath about me ,</l>
     <l n="43">When I breathe upon the landscape ,</l>
     <l n="44">Motionless are all the rivers ,</l>
     <l n="45">Hard as stone becomes the water ! ” 45</l>
     <l n="46">And the young man answered , smiling :</l>
     <l n="47">“ When I blow my breath about me ,</l>
     <l n="48">When I breathe upon the landscape ,</l>
     <l n="49">Flowers spring up o'er all the meadows ,</l>
     <l n="50">Singing , onward rush the rivers ! ” 50</l>
     <l n="51">“ When I shake my hoary tresses , ”</l>
     <l n="52">Said the old man , darkly frowning ,</l>
     <l n="53">“ All the land with snow is covered ;</l>
     <l n="54">All the leaves from all the branches</l>
     <l n="55">Fall and fade and die and wither , 55</l>
     <l n="56">For I breathe , and lo ! they are not .</l>
     <l n="57">From the waters and the marshes</l>
     <l n="58">Rise the wild goose and the heron ,</l>
     <l n="59">Fly away to distant regions ,</l>
     <l n="60">For I speak , and lo ! they are not . 60</l>
     <l n="61">And where'er my footsteps wander ,</l>
     <l n="62">All the wild beasts of the forest</l>
     <l n="63">Hide themselves in holes and caverns ,</l>
     <l n="64">And the earth becomes as flintstone ! ”</l>
     <l n="65">“ When I shake my flowing ringlets , ” 65</l>
     <l n="66">Said the young man , softly laughing ,</l>
     <l n="67">“ Showers of rain fall warm and welcome ,</l>
     <l n="68">Plants lift up their heads rejoicing ,</l>
     <l n="69">Back unto their lakes and marshes</l>
     <l n="70">Come the wild goose and the heron , 70</l>
     <l n="71">Homeward shoots the arrowy swallow ,</l>
     <l n="72">Sing the bluebird and the robin ,</l>
     <l n="73">And where'er my footsteps wander ,</l>
     <l n="74">All the meadows wave with blossoms ,</l>
     <l n="75">All the woodlands ring with music , 75</l>
     <l n="76">All the trees are dark with foliage ! ”</l>
     <l n="77">While they spake , the night departed :</l>
     <l n="78">From the distant realms of Wabun ,</l>
     <l n="79">From his shining lodge of silver ,</l>
     <l n="80">Like a warrior robed and painted , 80</l>
     <l n="81">Came the sun , and said , “ Behold me !</l>
     <l n="82">Gheezis , the great sun , behold me ! ”</l>
     <l n="83">Then the old man 's tongue was speechless</l>
     <l n="84">And the air grew warm and pleasant ,</l>
     <l n="85">And upon the wigwam sweetly 85</l>
     <l n="86">Sang the bluebird and the robin ,</l>
     <l n="87">And the stream began to murmur ,</l>
     <l n="88">And a scent of growing grasses</l>
     <l n="89">Through the lodge was gently wafted .</l>
     <l n="90">And Segwun , the youthful stranger , 90</l>
     <l n="91">More distinctly in the daylight</l>
     <l n="92">Saw the icy face before him ;</l>
     <l n="93">It was Peboan , the Winter !</l>
     <l n="94">From his eyes the tears were flowing ,</l>
     <l n="95">As from melting lakes the streamlets , 95</l>
     <l n="96">And his body shrunk and dwindled</l>
     <l n="97">As the shouting sun ascended ,</l>
     <l n="98">Till into the air it faded ,</l>
     <l n="99">Till into the ground it vanished ,</l>
     <l n="100">And the young man saw before him , 100</l>
     <l n="101">On the hearth-stone of the wigwam ,</l>
     <l n="102">Where the fire had smoked and smouldered ,</l>
     <l n="103">Saw the earliest flower of Spring-time ,</l>
     <l n="104">Saw the Beauty of the Spring-time ,</l>
     <l n="105">Saw the Miskodeed in blossom . 105</l>
     <l n="106">Thus it was that in the North-land</l>
     <l n="107">After that unheard-of coldness ,</l>
     <l n="108">That intolerable Winter ,</l>
     <l n="109">Came the Spring with all its splendor ,</l>
     <l n="110">All its birds and all its blossoms , 110</l>
     <l n="111">All its flowers and leaves and grasses .</l>
     <l n="112">Sailing on the wind to northward ,</l>
     <l n="113">Flying in great flocks , like arrows ,</l>
     <l n="114">Like huge arrows shot through heaven ,</l>
     <l n="115">Passed the swan , the Mahnahbezee , 115</l>
     <l n="116">Speaking almost as a man speaks ;</l>
     <l n="117">And in long lines waving , bending</l>
     <l n="118">Like a bow-string snapped asunder ,</l>
     <l n="119">Came the white goose , Waw-be-wawa ;</l>
     <l n="120">And in pairs , or singly flying , 120</l>
     <l n="121">Mahng the loon , with clangorous pinions ,</l>
     <l n="122">The blue heron , the Shuh-shuh-gah ,</l>
     <l n="123">And the grouse , the Mushkodasa .</l>
     <l n="124">In the thickets and the meadows</l>
     <l n="125">Piped the bluebird , the Owaissa , 125</l>
     <l n="126">On the summit of the lodges</l>
     <l n="127">Sang the Opechee , the robin ,</l>
     <l n="128">In the covert of the pine-trees</l>
     <l n="129">Cooed the pigeon , the Omemee ,</l>
     <l n="130">And the sorrowing Hiawatha , 130</l>
     <l n="131">Speechless in his infinite sorrow ,</l>
     <l n="132">Heard their voices calling to him ,</l>
     <l n="133">Went forth from his gloomy doorway ,</l>
     <l n="134">Stood and gazed into the heaven ,</l>
     <l n="135">Gazed upon the earth and waters . 135</l>

   <p>THE SKELETON IN ARMOR .</p>
   <p>THE SKELETON IN ARMOR .</p>
   <p>[ The following Ballad was suggested to me while riding on the seashore at Newport . A year or two previous a skeleton had been dug up at Fall River , clad in broken and corroded armor ; and the idea occurred to me of connecting it with the Round Tower at Newport , generally known hitherto as the Old Wind-Mill , though now claimed by the Danes as a work of their early ancestors . Professor Rafn , in the Mémoires de la Société Royale des Antiquaires du Nord , for 1838-1839 , says :</p>
   <p>“ There is no mistaking in this instance the style in which the more ancient stone edifices of the North were constructed , the style which belongs to the Roman or Ante-Gothic architecture , and which , especially , after the time of Charlemagne , diffused itself from Italy over the whole of the West and the North of Europe , where it continued to predominate until the close of the 12th century ; that style , which some authors have , from one of its most striking characteristics , called the round arch style , the same which in England is denominated Saxon and sometimes Norman architecture .</p>
   <p>“ On the ancient structure in Newport there are no ornaments remaining , which might possible have served to guide us in assigning the probably date of its erection . That no vestige whatever is found of the pointed arch nor any approximation to it , is indicative of an earlier rather than of a later period . From such characteristics as remain , however , we can scarcely form any other inference than one , in which I am persuaded that all , who are familiar with Old-Northern architecture will concur , THAT THIS BUILDING WAS ERECTED AT A PERIOD DECIDEDLY NOT LATER THAN THE 12TH CENTURY . This remark applies , of course , to the original building only , and not to the alterations that it subsequently received ; for there are several such alterations in the upper part of the building which cannot be mistaken , and which were most likely occasioned by its being adapted in modern times to various uses , for example as the substructure of a wind-mill , and latterly as a hay magazine . To the same times may be referred the windows , the fireplace , and the apertures made above the columns . That this building could not have been erected for a wind-mill , is what an architect will easily discern . ”</p>
   <p>I will not enter into a discussion of the point . It is sufficiently well established for the purpose of a ballad ; though doubtless many an honest citizen of Newport , who has passed his days within sight of the Round Tower , will be ready to exclaim with Sancho ; “ God bless me ! did I not warn you to have a care of what you were doing , for that it was nothing but a wind-mill ; and nobody could mistake it , but one who had the like in his head . ” ]</p>

    <head>THE CHILDREN OF THE LORD 'S SUPPER .</head>
    <head>FROM THE SWEDISH OF BISHOP TEGNOR</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Pentecost , day of rejoicing , had come . The church of the village</l>
     <l n="2">Stood gleaming white in the morning 's sheen . On the spire of the</l>
     <l n="3">belfry ,</l>
     <l n="4">Tipped with a vane of metal , the friendly frames of the Spring-sun</l>
     <l n="5">Glanced like the tongues of fire , beheld by Apostles aforetime .</l>
     <l n="6">Clear was the heaven and blue , and May , with her cap crowned with</l>
     <l n="7">roses ,</l>
     <l n="8">Stood in her holiday dress in the fields , and the wind and the</l>
     <l n="9">brooklet</l>
     <l n="10">Murmured gladness and peace , God'shYpppHeNpeace ! With lips rosy-tinted</l>
     <l n="11">Whispered the race of the flowers , and merry on balancing branches</l>
     <l n="12">Birds were singing their carol , a jubilant hymn to the Highest .</l>
     <l n="13">Swept and clean was the churchyard . Adorned like a leaf-woven arbor</l>
     <l n="14">Stood its old-fashioned gate ; and within upon each cross of iron</l>
     <l n="15">Hung was a sweet-scented garland , new twined by the hands of</l>
     <l n="16">affection .</l>
     <l n="17">Even the dial , that stood on a fountain among the departed</l>
     <l n="18">( There full a hundred years had it stood ) , was embellished with</l>
     <l n="19">blossoms .</l>
     <l n="20">Like to the patriarch hoary , the sage of his kith and the hamlet ,</l>
     <l n="21">Who on his birthday is crowned by children and children 's children ,</l>
     <l n="22">So stood the ancient prophet , and mute with pencil of iron</l>
     <l n="23">Marked on the table of stone , and measured the swift-changing moment ,</l>
     <l n="24">While all around at his feet , an eternity slumbered in quiet .</l>
     <l n="25">Also the church within was adorned , for this was the season</l>
     <l n="26">In which the young , their parent 's hope , and the loved-ones of</l>
     <l n="27">heaven ,</l>
     <l n="28">Should at the foot of the altar renew the vows of their baptism .</l>
     <l n="29">Therefore each nook and corner was swept and cleaned , and the dust</l>
     <l n="30">was</l>
     <l n="31">Blown from the walls and ceiling , and from the oil-painted benches .</l>
     <l n="32">There stood the church like a garden ; the Feast of the Leafy</l>
     <l n="33">Pavilions [ A ]</l>
     <l n="34">Saw we in living presentment . From noble arms on the church wall</l>
     <l n="35">Grew forth a cluster of leaves , and the preacher 's pulpit of oakwood</l>
     <l n="36">Budded once more anew , as aforetime the rod before Aaron .</l>
     <l n="37">Wreathed thereon was the Bible with leaves , and the dove , washed with</l>
     <l n="38">silver ,</l>
     <l n="39">Under its conopy fastened , a necklace had on of wind-flowers .</l>
     <l n="40">But in front of the choir , round the altarpiece painted by</l>
     <l n="41">Horberg , [ B ]</l>
     <l n="42">Crept a garland gigantic ; and bright-curling tresses of angels</l>
     <l n="43">Peeped , like the sun from a cloud , out of the shadowy leaf-work .</l>
     <l n="44">Likewise the lustre of brass , new-polished , blinked from the ceiling ,</l>
     <l n="45">And for lights there were lilies of Pentecost set in the sockets .</l>
     <l n="46">Loud rang the bells already ; the thronging crowd was assembled</l>
     <l n="47">Far from valleys and hills , to list to the holy preaching .</l>
     <l n="48">Hark ! then roll forth at once the mighty tones from the organ ,</l>
     <l n="49">Hover like voices from God , aloft like invisible spirits .</l>
     <l n="50">Like as Elias in heaven , when he cast off from him his mantle ,</l>
     <l n="51">Even so cast off the soul its garments of earth ; and with one voice</l>
     <l n="52">Chimed in the congregation , and sang an anthem immortal</l>
     <l n="53">Of the sublime Wallin , [ C ] of David 's harp in the North-land</l>
     <l n="54">Tuned to the choral of Luther ; the song on its powerful pinions</l>
     <l n="55">Took every living soul , and lifted it gently to heaven .</l>
     <l n="56">And every face did shine like the Holy One 's face upon Tabor .</l>
     <l n="57">Lo ! there entered then into the church the Reverend Teacher .</l>
     <l n="58">Father he hight and he was in the parish ; a christianly plainness</l>
     <l n="59">Clothed from his head to his feet the old man of seventy winters .</l>
     <l n="60">Friendly was he to behold , and glad as the heralding angel</l>
     <l n="61">Walked he among the crowds , but still a contemplative grandeur</l>
     <l n="62">Lay on his forehead as clear , as on a moss-covered grave-stone a</l>
     <l n="63">sunbeam .</l>
     <l n="64">As in his inspiration ( an evening twilight that faintly</l>
     <l n="65">Gleams in the human soul , even now , from the day of creation )</l>
     <l n="66">Th ’ Artist , the friend of heaven , imagines Saint John when in</l>
     <l n="67">Patmos ;—</l>
     <l n="68">Gray , with his eyes uplifted to heaven , so seemed then the old man ;</l>
     <l n="69">Such was the glance of his eye , and such were his tresses of silver .</l>
     <l n="70">All the congregation arose in the pews that were numbered ,</l>
     <l n="71">But with a cordial look , to the right and the left hand , the old man</l>
     <l n="72">Nodding all hail and peace , disappeared in the innermost chancel .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="73">Simply and solemnly now proceeded the Christian service ,</l>
     <l n="74">Singing and prayer , and at last an ardent discourse from the old man .</l>
     <l n="75">Many a moving word and warning , that out of the heart came</l>
     <l n="76">Fell like the dew of the morning , like manna on those in the desert .</l>
     <l n="77">Afterwards , when all was finished , the Teacher reentered the chancel ,</l>
     <l n="78">Followed therein by the young . On the right hand the boys had their</l>
     <l n="79">places</l>
     <l n="80">Delicate figures , with close-curling hair and cheeks rosy-blooming .</l>
     <l n="81">But on the left-hand of these , there stood the tremulous lilies ,</l>
     <l n="82">Tinged with the blushing light of the morning , the diffident</l>
     <l n="83">maidens ,—</l>
     <l n="84">Folding their hands in prayer , and their eyes cast down on the</l>
     <l n="85">pavement .</l>
     <l n="86">Now came , with question and answer , the catechism . In the beginning</l>
     <l n="87">Answered the children with troubled and faltering voice , but the old</l>
     <l n="88">man 's</l>
     <l n="89">Glances of kindness encouraged them soon , and the doctrines eternal</l>
     <l n="90">Flowed , like the waters of fountains , so clear from lips unpolluted .</l>
     <l n="91">Whene'er the answer was closed , and as oft as they named the Redeemer ,</l>
     <l n="92">Lowly louted the boys , and lowly the maidens all courtesied .</l>
     <l n="93">Friendly the Teacher stood , like an angel of light there among them ,</l>
     <l n="94">And to the children explained he the holy , the highest , in few words ,</l>
     <l n="95">Thorough , yet simple and clear , for sublimity always is simple ,</l>
     <l n="96">Both in sermon and song a child can seize on its meaning .</l>
     <l n="97">Even as the green-growing bud is unfolded when Spring-tide approaches</l>
     <l n="98">Leaf by leaf is developed , and , warmed by the radiant sunshine ,</l>
     <l n="99">Blushes with purple and gold , till at last the perfected blossom</l>
     <l n="100">Opens its odorous chalice , and rocks with its crown in the breezes ,</l>
     <l n="101">So was unfolded here the Christian lore of salvation ,</l>
     <l n="102">Line by line from the soul of childhood . The fathers and mothers</l>
     <l n="103">Stood behind them in tears , and were glad at each well-worded answer .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="104">Now went the old man up to the altar ;— and straightway transfigured</l>
     <l n="105">( So did it seem unto me ) was then the affectionate Teacher ,</l>
     <l n="106">Like the Lord 's Prophet sublime , and awful as Death and as Judgment</l>
     <l n="107">Stood he , the God-commissioned , the soul-searcher , earthward</l>
     <l n="108">descending ,</l>
     <l n="109">Glances , sharp as a sword , into hearts , that to him were transparent</l>
     <l n="110">Shot he ; his voice was deep , was low like the thunder afar off .</l>
     <l n="111">So on a sudden transfigured he stood there , he spake and he</l>
     <l n="112">questioned .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="113">“ This is the faith of the Fathers , the faith the Apostles delivered ,</l>
     <l n="114">This is moreover the faith whereunto I baptized you , while still ye</l>
     <l n="115">Lay on your mothers ’ breasts , and nearer the portals of heaven .</l>
     <l n="116">Slumbering received you then the Holy Church in its bosom ;</l>
     <l n="117">Wakened from sleep are ye now , and the light in the radiant splendor</l>
     <l n="118">Rains from the heaven downward ;— to-day on the threshhold of childhood</l>
     <l n="119">Kindly she frees you again , to examine and make your election ,</l>
     <l n="120">For she knows nought of compulsion , only conviction desireth .</l>
     <l n="121">This is the hour of your trial , the turning-point of existence ,</l>
     <l n="122">Seed for the coming days ; without revocation departeth</l>
     <l n="123">Now from your lips the confession ; Bethink ye , before ye make answer !</l>
     <l n="124">Think not ! O think not with guile to deceive the questioning Teacher .</l>
     <l n="125">Sharp is his eye to-day , and a curse ever rests upon falsehood .</l>
     <l n="126">Enter not with a lie on Life 's journey ; the multitude hears you ,</l>
     <l n="127">Brothers and sisters and parents , what dear upon earth is and holy</l>
     <l n="128">Standeth before your sight as a witness ; the Judge everlasting</l>
     <l n="129">Looks from the sun down upon you , and angels in waiting beside him</l>
     <l n="130">Grave your confession in letters of fire , upon tablets eternal .</l>
     <l n="131">Thus then ,— believe ye in God , in the Father who this world created ?</l>
     <l n="132">Him who redeemed it , the Son , and the Spirit where both are united ?</l>
     <l n="133">Will ye promise me here ( a holy promise ) , to cherish</l>
     <l n="134">God more than all things earthly , and every man as a brother ?</l>
     <l n="135">Will ye promise me here , to confirm your faith by your living ,</l>
     <l n="136">Th ’ heavenly faith of affection ! to hope , to forgive , and to suffer ,</l>
     <l n="137">Be what it may your condition , and walk before God in uprightness ?</l>
     <l n="138">Will ye promise me this before God and man ? ’ — With a clear voice</l>
     <l n="139">Answered the young men Yes ! and Yes ! with lips softly-breathing</l>
     <l n="140">Answered the maidens eke . Then dissolved from the brow of the Teacher</l>
     <l n="141">Clouds with the thunders therein , and he spake on in accents more</l>
     <l n="142">gentle ,</l>
     <l n="143">Soft as the evening 's breath , as harps by Babylon 's rivers .</l>

     <l n="146">Yet ,— for what reason not children ? Of such is the kingdom of heaven .</l>
     <l n="147">Here upon earth an assemblage of children , in heaven one father ,</l>
     <l n="148">Ruling them as his own household ,— forgiving in turn and chastising ,</l>
     <l n="149">That is of human life a picture , as Scripture has taught us .</l>

     <l n="159">Gave you her hand to kiss , and the loving heart was forgiven ,</l>
     <l n="160">Life was a play and your hands grasped after the roses of heaven !</l>
     <l n="161">Seventy years have I lived already ; the Father eternal</l>
     <l n="162">Gave to me gladness and care ; but the loveliest hours of existence ,</l>
     <l n="163">When I have steadfastly gazed in their eyes , I have instantly known</l>
     <l n="164">them ,</l>
     <l n="165">Known them all , all again ;— they were my childhood 's acquaintance .</l>
     <l n="166">Therefore take from henceforth , as guides in the paths of existence ,</l>
     <l n="167">Prayer , with her eyes raised to heaven , and Innocence , bride of man 's</l>
     <l n="168">childhood .</l>
     <l n="169">Innocence , child beloved , is a guest from the world of the blessed .</l>
     <l n="170">Beautiful , and in her hand a lily ; on life 's roaring billows</l>
     <l n="171">Swings she in safety , she heeded them not , in the ship she was</l>
     <l n="172">sleeping .</l>
     <l n="173">Calmly she gazes around in the turmoil of men ; in the desert</l>
     <l n="174">Angels descend and minister unto her ; she herself knoweth</l>
     <l n="175">Naught of her glorious attendance ; but follows faithful and humble ,</l>
     <l n="176">Follows so long as she may her friend ; O do not reject her ,</l>
     <l n="177">For she cometh from God and she holdeth the keys of the heavens .—</l>
     <l n="178">Prayer is Innocence ’ friend ; and willingly flieth incessant</l>
     <l n="179">‘ Twixt the earth and the sky , the carrier-pigeon of heaven .</l>
     <l n="180">Son of Eternity , fettered in Time , and an exile , the Spirit</l>
     <l n="181">Tugs at his chains evermore , and struggles like flames ever upward .</l>
     <l n="182">Still he recalls with emotion his father 's manifold mansions .</l>
     <l n="183">Thinks of the land of his fathers , where blossomed more freshly the</l>
     <l n="184">flowers ,</l>
     <l n="185">Shone a more beautiful sun , and he played with the winged angels .</l>
     <l n="186">Then grows the earth too narrow , too close ; and homesick for heaven</l>
     <l n="187">Longs the wanderer again ; and the Spirit 's longings are worship ;</l>
     <l n="188">Worship is called his most beautiful hour , and its tongue is entreaty .</l>
     <l n="189">Ah ! when the infinite burden of life descendeth upon us ,</l>
     <l n="190">Crushes to earth our hope , and , under the earth , in the grave-yard ,—</l>
     <l n="191">Then it is good to pray unto God ; for his sorrowing children</l>
     <l n="192">Turns he ne'er from his door , but he heals and helps and consoles them .</l>
     <l n="193">Yet it is better to pray when all things are prosperous with us ,</l>
     <l n="194">Pray in fortunate days , for life 's most beautiful Fortune</l>
     <l n="195">Kneels down before the Eternal 's throne ; and , with hands interfolded ,</l>
     <l n="196">Praises thankful and moved the only Giver of blessings .</l>
     <l n="197">Or do ye know , ye children , one blessing that comes not from Heaven ?</l>
     <l n="198">What has mankind forsooth , the poor ! that it has not received ?</l>
     <l n="199">Therefore , fall in the dust and pray ! The seraphs adoring</l>
     <l n="200">Cover with pinions six their face in the glory of him who</l>
     <l n="201">Hung his masonry pendant on naught , when the world he created .</l>
     <l n="202">Earth declareth his might , and the firmament uttereth his glory .</l>
     <l n="203">Races blossom and die , and stars fall downward from heaven ,</l>
     <l n="204">Downward like withered leaves : at the last stroke of midnight ,</l>
     <l n="205">millenniums</l>
     <l n="206">Lay themselves down at his feet , and he sees them , but counts them as</l>
     <l n="207">nothing .</l>
     <l n="208">Who shall stand in his presence ? The wrath of the Judge is terrific ,</l>
     <l n="209">Casting the insolent down at a glance . When he speaks in his anger</l>
     <l n="210">Hillocks skip like the kid , and the mountains leap like the roe-buck .</l>
     <l n="211">Yet ,— why are ye afraid , ye children ? This awful avenger ,</l>
     <l n="212">Ah ! is a merciful God ! God 's voice was not in the earthquake ,</l>
     <l n="213">Not in the fire , nor the storm , but it was in the whispering breezes .</l>
     <l n="214">Love is the root of creation ; God 's essence ; worlds without number</l>
     <l n="215">Lie in his bosom like children ; he made them for this purpose only .</l>
     <l n="216">Only to love and to be loved again , he breathed forth his spirit</l>
     <l n="217">Into the slumbering dust , and upright standing , it laid its</l>
     <l n="218">Hand on its heart , and felt it was warm with a flame out of heaven .</l>
     <l n="219">Quench , O quench not that flame ! It is the breath of your being .</l>
     <l n="220">Love is life , but hatred is death . Not father nor mother</l>
     <l n="221">Loved you , as God has loved you ; for it was that you may be happy</l>
     <l n="222">Gave he his only son . When he bowed down his head in the death-hour</l>
     <l n="223">Solemnized Love its triumph ; the sacrifice then was completed .</l>
     <l n="224">Lo ! then was rent on a sudden the vail of the temple , dividing</l>
     <l n="225">Earth and heaven apart , and the dead from their sepulchers rising</l>
     <l n="226">Whispered with pallid lips and low in the ears of each other</l>
     <l n="227">Th ’ answer , but dreamed of before , to creation 's enigma ,— Atonement !</l>
     <l n="228">Depths of Love are Atonement 's depths , for Love is Atonement .</l>
     <l n="229">Therefore , child of mortality , love thou the merciful Father ;</l>
     <l n="230">Wish what the Holy One wishes , and not from fear , but affection ;</l>
     <l n="231">Fear is the virtue of slaves ; but the heart that loveth is willing ;</l>
     <l n="232">Perfect was before God , and perfect is Love , and Love only .</l>
     <l n="233">Lovest thou God as thou oughtest , then lovest thou likewise thy</l>
     <l n="234">brethren ;</l>
     <l n="235">One is the sun in Heaven , and one , only one is love also .</l>
     <l n="236">Bears not each human figure the godlike stamp on his forehead ?</l>
     <l n="237">Readest thou not in his face thine origin ? Is he not sailing</l>
     <l n="238">Lost like thyself on an ocean unknown , and is he not guided</l>
     <l n="239">By the same stars that guide thee ? Why shouldst thou hate then thy</l>
     <l n="240">brother ?</l>
     <l n="241">Hateth he thee , forgive ! For ‘ tis sweet to stammer one letter</l>
     <l n="242">Of the Eternal 's language ;— on earth it is called Forgiveness !</l>
     <l n="243">Knowest thou Him , who forgave , with the crown of thorns round his</l>
     <l n="244">temples ?</l>
     <l n="245">Earnestly prayed for his foes , for his murderers ? Say , dost thou know</l>
     <l n="246">him ?</l>
     <l n="247">Ah ! thou confessest his name , so follow likewise his example ,</l>
     <l n="248">Think of thy brother no ill , but throw a vail over his failings ,</l>
     <l n="249">Guide the erring aright ; for the good , the heavenly shepherd</l>
     <l n="250">Took the lost lamb in his arms , and bore it back to its mother .</l>
     <l n="251">This is the fruit of Love , and it is by its fruits that we know it .</l>
     <l n="252">Love is the creature 's welfare , with God ; but Love among mortals</l>
     <l n="253">Is but an endless sigh ! He longs , and endures , and stands waiting ,</l>
     <l n="254">Suffers and yet rejoices , and smiles with tears on his eyelids .</l>
     <l n="255">Hope ,— so is called upon earth , his recompense .— Hope , the</l>
     <l n="256">befriending ,</l>
     <l n="257">Does what she can , for she points evermore up to heaven , and faithful</l>
     <l n="258">Plunges her anchor 's peak in the depths of the grave , and beneath it</l>
     <l n="259">Paints a more beautiful world , a dim , but a sweet play of shadows !</l>
     <l n="260">Races , better than we , have leaned on her wavering promise ,</l>
     <l n="261">Having naught else beside Hope . Then praise we our Father in Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="262">Him , who has given us more ; for to us has Hope been illumined ,</l>
     <l n="263">Groping no longer in night ; she is Faith , she is living assurance .</l>
     <l n="264">Faith is enlightened Hope ; she is light , is the eye of affection</l>
     <l n="265">Dreams of the longing interprets , and carves their visions in marble .</l>
     <l n="266">Faith is the sun of life ; and her countenance shines like the</l>
     <l n="267">Prophet 's ,</l>
     <l n="268">For she has looked upon God ; the heaven on its stable foundation</l>
     <l n="269">Draws she with chains down to earth , and the New Jerusalem sinketh</l>
     <l n="270">Splendid with portals twelve in golden vapors descending .</l>
     <l n="271">There enraptured she wanders , and looks at the figures majestic ,</l>
     <l n="272">Fears not the winged crowd , in the midst of them all is her homestead .</l>
     <l n="273">Therefore love and believe ; for works will follow spontaneous</l>
     <l n="274">Even as day does the sun ; the Right from the Good is an offspring ,</l>
     <l n="275">Love in a bodily shape ; and Christian works are no more than</l>
     <l n="276">Animate Love and faith , as flowers are the animate spring-tide .</l>
     <l n="277">Works do follow us all unto God ; there stand and bear witness</l>
     <l n="278">Not what they seemed ,— but what they were only . Blessed is he who</l>
     <l n="279">Hears their confession secure ; they are mute upon earth until death 's</l>
     <l n="280">hand</l>
     <l n="281">Opens the mouth of the silent . Ye children does Death e'er alarm you ?</l>
     <l n="282">Death is the brother of Love , twin-brother is he , and is only</l>
     <l n="283">More austere to behold . With a kiss upon lips that are fading</l>
     <l n="284">Takes he the soul and departs , and rocked in arms of affection ,</l>
     <l n="285">Places the ransomed child , new born , ‘ fore the face of its father .</l>
     <l n="286">Sounds of his coming already I hear ,— see dimly his pinions ,</l>
     <l n="287">Swart as the night , but with stars strewn upon them ! I fear not before</l>
     <l n="288">him .</l>
     <l n="289">Death is only release , and in mercy is mute . On his bosom</l>
     <l n="290">Freer breathes , in its coolness , my breast ; and face to face standing</l>
     <l n="291">Look I on God as he is , a sun unpolluted by vapors ;</l>
     <l n="292">Look on the light of the ages I loved , the spirits majestic ,</l>
     <l n="293">Nobler , better than I ; they stand by the throne all transfigured ,</l>
     <l n="294">Vested in white , and with harps of gold , and are singing an anthem ,</l>
     <l n="295">Writ in the climate of heaven , in the language spoken by angels .</l>
     <l n="296">You , in like manner , ye children beloved , he one day shall gather ,</l>
     <l n="297">Never forgets he the weary ;— then welcome , ye loved ones , hereafter !</l>
     <l n="298">Meanwhile forget not the keeping of vows , forget not the promise ,</l>
     <l n="299">Wander from holiness onward to holiness ; earth shall ye heed not ;</l>
     <l n="300">Earth is but dust and heaven is light ; I have pledged you to heaven .</l>
     <l n="301">God of the Universe , hear me ! thou fountain of Love everlasting ,</l>
     <l n="302">Hark to the voice of thy servant ! I send up my prayer to thy heaven !</l>
     <l n="303">Let me hereafter not miss at thy throne one spirit of all these ,</l>
     <l n="304">Whom thou hast given me here ! I have loved them all like a father .</l>
     <l n="305">May they bear witness for me , that I taught them the way of salvation ,</l>
     <l n="306">Faithful , so far as I knew of thy word : again may they know me ,</l>
     <l n="307">Fall on their Teacher 's breast , and before thy face may I place them ,</l>
     <l n="308">Pure as they now are , but only more tried , and exclaiming with</l>
     <l n="309">gladness ,</l>
     <l n="310">Father , lo ! I am here , and the children , whom thou hast given me ! ”</l>

     <l n="311">Weeping he spake in these words ; and now at the beck of the old man</l>
     <l n="312">Knee against knee they knitted a wreath round the altar 's enclosure .</l>
     <l n="313">Kneeling he read then the prayers of the consecration , and softly</l>
     <l n="314">With him the children read ; at the close , with tremulous accents ,</l>
     <l n="315">Asked he the peace of heaven , a benediction upon them .</l>
     <l n="316">Now should have ended his task for the day ; the following Sunday</l>
     <l n="317">Was for the young appointed to eat of the Lord 's holy Supper .</l>
     <l n="318">Sudden , as struck from the clouds , stood the Teacher silent and laid</l>
     <l n="319">his</l>
     <l n="320">Hand on his forehead , and cast his looks upward ; while thoughts high</l>
     <l n="321">and holy</l>
     <l n="322">Flew through the midst of his soul , and his eyes glanced with</l>
     <l n="323">wonderful brightness .</l>
     <l n="324">“ On the next Sunday , who knows ! perhaps I shall rest in the</l>
     <l n="325">grave-yard !</l>
     <l n="326">Some one perhaps of yourselves , a lily broken untimely ,</l>
     <l n="327">Bow down his head to the earth ; why delay I ? the hour is accomplished .</l>
     <l n="328">Warm is the heart ;— I will so ! for to-day grows the harvest of heaven .</l>
     <l n="329">What I began accomplish I now ; for what failing therein is</l>
     <l n="330">I , the old man , will answer to God and the reverend father .</l>
     <l n="331">Say to me only , ye children , ye denizens new-come in heaven ,</l>
     <l n="332">Are ye ready this day to eat of the bread of Atonement ?</l>
     <l n="333">What it denoteth , that know ye full well , I have told it you often .</l>
     <l n="334">Of the new covenant a symbol it is , of Atonement a token ,</l>
     <l n="335">‘ Stablished between earth and heaven . Man by his sins and</l>
     <l n="336">transgressions</l>
     <l n="337">Far has wandered from God , from his essence . ‘ Twas in the beginning</l>
     <l n="338">Fast by the Tree of Knowledge he fell , and it hangs its crown o'er the</l>
     <l n="339">Fall to this day ; in the Thought is the Fall ; in the Heart the</l>
     <l n="340">Atonement .</l>
     <l n="341">Infinite is the Fall , the Atonement infinite likewise .</l>
     <l n="342">See ! behind me , as far as the old man remembers , and forward ,</l>
     <l n="343">Far as Hope in her flight can reach with her wearied pinions ,</l>
     <l n="344">Sin and Atonement incessant go through the lifetime of mortals .</l>
     <l n="345">Brought forth is sin full-grown ; but Atonement sleeps in our bosoms</l>
     <l n="346">Still as the cradled babe ; and dreams of heaven and of angels</l>
     <l n="347">Cannot wake to sensation ; is like the tones in the harp 's strings ,</l>
     <l n="348">Spirits imprisoned , that wait evermore the deliverer 's finger .</l>
     <l n="349">Therefore , ye children beloved , descended the Prince of Atonement ,</l>
     <l n="350">Woke the slumberer from sleep , and he stands now with eyes all</l>
     <l n="351">resplendent ,</l>
     <l n="352">Bright as the vault of the sky , and battles with Sin and o'ercomes her</l>
     <l n="353">Downward to earth he came and transfigured thence reascended ,</l>
     <l n="354">Not from the heart in likewise , for there he still lives in the</l>
     <l n="355">Spirit ,</l>
     <l n="356">Loves and atones evermore . So long as Time is , is Atonement .</l>
     <l n="357">Therefore with reverence receive this day her visible token .</l>
     <l n="358">Tokens are dead if the things do not live . The light everlasting</l>
     <l n="359">Unto the blind man is not , but is born of the eye that has vision .</l>
     <l n="360">Neither in bread nor in wine , but in the heart that is hallowed</l>
     <l n="361">Lieth forgivenes enshrined ; the intention alone of amendment .</l>
     <l n="362">Fruits of the earth ennobles to heavenly things , and removes all</l>
     <l n="363">Sin and the guerdon of sin . Only Love with his arms wide extended ,</l>
     <l n="364">Penitence weeping and praying ; the Will that is tried , and whose gold</l>
     <l n="365">flows</l>
     <l n="366">Purified forth from the flames ; in a word , mankind by Atonement</l>
     <l n="367">Breaketh Atonement 's bread , and drinketh Atonement 's wine cup .</l>
     <l n="368">But he who cometh up hither , unworthy with hate in his bosom .</l>
     <l n="369">Scoffing at men and at God , is guilty of Christ 's blessed body ,</l>
     <l n="370">And the Redeemer 's blood ! To himself he eateth and drinketh</l>
     <l n="371">Death and doom ! And from this , preserve us , thou heavenly Father !</l>
     <l n="372">Are ye ready , ye children , to eat of the bread of Atonement ? ”</l>
     <l n="373">Thus with emotion he asked , and together answered the children</l>
     <l n="374">Yes ! with deep sobs interrupted . Then read he the due supplications ,</l>
     <l n="375">Read the Form of Communion , and in chimed the organ and anthem ;</l>
     <l n="376">O ! Holy Lamb of God , who takest away our transgressions .</l>
     <l n="377">Hear us ! give us thy peace ! have mercy , have mercy upon us !</l>
     <l n="378">Th ’ old man , with trembling hand , and heavenly pearls on his eyelids ,</l>
     <l n="379">Filled now the chalice and paten , and dealt round the mystical</l>
     <l n="380">symbols .</l>
     <l n="381">O ! then seemed it to me , as if God , with the broad eye of mid-day ,</l>
     <l n="382">Clearer looked in at the windows , and all the trees in the churchyard</l>
     <l n="383">Bowed down their summits of green and the grass on the graves ‘ gan to</l>
     <l n="384">shiver .</l>
     <l n="385">But in the children ( I noted it well ; I knew it ) there ran a</l>
     <l n="386">Tremor of holy rapture along through their ice-cold members .</l>
     <l n="387">Decked like an altar before them , there stood the green earth , and</l>
     <l n="388">above it</l>
     <l n="389">Heaven opened itself , as of old before Stephen ; there saw they</l>
     <l n="390">Radiant in glory the Father , and on his right hand the Redeemer .</l>
     <l n="391">Under them hear they the clang of harp-strings , and angels from gold</l>
     <l n="392">clouds</l>
     <l n="393">Beckon to them like brothers , and fan with their pinions of purple .</l>
     <l n="394">Closed was the Teacher 's task , and with heaven in their hearts and</l>
     <l n="395">their faces ,</l>
     <l n="396">Up rose the children all , and each bowed him , weeping full sorely ,</l>
     <l n="397">Downward to kiss that reverend hand , but all of them pressed he</l>
     <l n="398">Moved to his bosom , and laid , with a prayer , his hands full of</l>
     <l n="399">blessings ,</l>
     <l n="400">Now on the holy breast , and now on the innocent tresses .</l>
