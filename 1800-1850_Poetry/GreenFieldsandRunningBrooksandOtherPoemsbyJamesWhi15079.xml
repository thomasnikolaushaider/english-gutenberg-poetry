    <head>A COUNTRY PATHWAY .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I come upon it suddenly , alone —</l>
     <l n="2">A little pathway winding in the weeds</l>
     <l n="3">That fringe the roadside ; and with dreams my own ,</l>
     <l n="4">I wander as it leads .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Full wistfully along the slender way ,</l>
     <l n="6">Through summer tan of freckled shade and shine ,</l>
     <l n="7">I take the path that leads me as it may —</l>
     <l n="8">Its every choice is mine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">A chipmunk , or a sudden-whirring quail ,</l>
     <l n="10">Is startled by my step as on I fare —</l>
     <l n="11">A garter-snake across the dusty trail</l>
     <l n="12">Glances and — is not there .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Above the arching jimson-weeds flare twos</l>
     <l n="14">And twos of sallow-yellow butterflies ,</l>
     <l n="15">Like blooms of lorn primroses blowing loose</l>
     <l n="16">When autumn winds arise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">The trail dips — dwindles — broadens then , and lifts</l>
     <l n="18">Itself astride a cross-road dubiously ,</l>
     <l n="19">And , from the fennel marge beyond it , drifts</l>
     <l n="20">Still onward , beckoning me .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">And though it needs must lure me mile on mile</l>
     <l n="22">Out of the public highway , still I go ,</l>
     <l n="23">My thoughts , far in advance in Indian-file ,</l>
     <l n="24">Allure me even so .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">Why , I am as a long-lost boy that went</l>
     <l n="26">At dusk to bring the cattle to the bars ,</l>
     <l n="27">And was not found again , though Heaven lent</l>
     <l n="28">His mother ail the stars</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">With which to seek him through that awful night .</l>
     <l n="30">O years of nights as vain !— Stars never rise</l>
     <l n="31">But well might miss their glitter in the light</l>
     <l n="32">Of tears in mother-eyes !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">So — on , with quickened breaths , I follow still —</l>
     <l n="34">My avant-courier must be obeyed !</l>
     <l n="35">Thus am I led , and thus the path , at will ,</l>
     <l n="36">Invites me to invade</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">A meadow 's precincts , where my daring guide</l>
     <l n="38">Clambers the steps of an old-fashioned stile ,</l>
     <l n="39">And stumbles down again , the other side ,</l>
     <l n="40">To gambol there awhile</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">In pranks of hide-and-seek , as on ahead</l>
     <l n="42">I see it running , while the clover-stalks</l>
     <l n="43">Shake rosy fists at me , as though they said —</l>
     <l n="44">“ You dog our country-walks</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="45">And mutilate us with your walking-stick !—</l>
     <l n="46">We will not suffer tamely what you do</l>
     <l n="47">And warn you at your peril ,— for we 'll sic</l>
     <l n="48">Our bumble-bees on you ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="49">But I smile back , in airy nonchalance ,—</l>
     <l n="50">The more determined on my wayward quest ,</l>
     <l n="51">As some bright memory a moment dawns</l>
     <l n="52">A morning in my breast —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="53">Sending a thrill that hurries me along</l>
     <l n="54">In faulty similes of childish skips ,</l>
     <l n="55">Enthused with lithe contortions of a song</l>
     <l n="56">Performing on my lips .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="57">In wild meanderings o'er pasture wealth —</l>
     <l n="58">Erratic wanderings through dead'ninghYpppHeNlands ,</l>
     <l n="59">Where sly old brambles , plucking me by stealth ,</l>
     <l n="60">Put berries in my hands :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="61">Or , the path climbs a boulder — wades a slough —</l>
     <l n="62">Or , rollicking through buttercups and flags ,</l>
     <l n="63">Goes gaily dancing o'er a deep bayou</l>
     <l n="64">On old tree-trunks and snags :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="65">Or , at the creek , leads o'er a limpid pool</l>
     <l n="66">Upon a bridge the stream itself has made ,</l>
     <l n="67">With some Spring-freshet for the mighty tool</l>
     <l n="68">That its foundation laid .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="69">I pause a moment here to bend and muse ,</l>
     <l n="70">With dreamy eyes , on my reflection , where</l>
     <l n="71">A boat-backed bug drifts on a helpless cruise ,</l>
     <l n="72">Or wildly oars the air ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="73">As , dimly seen , the pirate of the brook —</l>
     <l n="74">The pike , whose jaunty hulk denotes his speed —</l>
     <l n="75">Swings pivoting about , with wary look</l>
     <l n="76">Of low and cunning greed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="77">Till , filled with other thought , I turn again</l>
     <l n="78">To where the pathway enters in a realm</l>
     <l n="79">Of lordly woodland , under sovereign reign</l>
     <l n="80">Of towering oak and elm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="81">A puritanic quiet here reviles</l>
     <l n="82">The almost whispered warble from the hedge ,</l>
     <l n="83">And takes a locust 's rasping voice and files</l>
     <l n="84">The silence to an edge .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="85">In such a solitude my somber way</l>
     <l n="86">Strays like a misanthrope within a gloom</l>
     <l n="87">Of his own shadows — till the perfect day</l>
     <l n="88">Bursts into sudden bloom ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="89">And crowns a long , declining stretch of space ,</l>
     <l n="90">Where King Corn 's armies lie with flags unfurled ,</l>
     <l n="91">And where the valley 's dint in Nature 's face</l>
     <l n="92">Dimples a smiling world .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="93">And lo ! through mists that may not be dispelled ,</l>
     <l n="94">I see an old farm homestead , as in dreams ,</l>
     <l n="95">Where , like a gem in costly setting held ,</l>
     <l n="96">The old log cabin gleams .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="97">O darling Pathway ! lead me bravely on</l>
     <l n="98">Adown your valley way , and run before</l>
     <l n="99">Among the roses crowding up the lawn</l>
     <l n="100">And thronging at the door ,—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="101">And carry up the echo there that shall</l>
     <l n="102">Arouse the drowsy dog , that he may bay</l>
     <l n="103">The household out to greet the prodigal</l>
     <l n="104">That wanders home to-day .</l>

     <l n="13">Crawl out on some old log , with my hook and line ,</l>
     <l n="14">Where the fish is jes so thick you kin see ‘ em shine</l>

     <l n="23">Stars up through the tree-tops — er in the crick below ,—</l>
     <l n="24">And smell o ’ mussrat through the dark clean from the old b'yhYpppHeNo !</l>

     <l n="69">As day-dawn ; waiting , waiting still</l>

     <l n="72">You will recall a while ago</l>
     <l n="73">I told you he and I were friends .</l>
     <l n="74">In all that friendship comprehends ,</l>
     <l n="75">I was his friend , I swear ! why now ,</l>
     <l n="76">Remembering his love , and how</l>
     <l n="77">His confidence was all my own ,</l>
     <l n="78">I hear , in fancy , the low tone</l>
     <l n="79">Of his deep voice , so full of pride</l>
     <l n="80">And passion , yet so pacified</l>
     <l n="81">With his affliction , that it seems</l>
     <l n="82">An utterance sent out of dreams</l>
     <l n="83">Of saddest melody , withal</l>
     <l n="84">So sorrowfully musical</l>
     <l n="85">It was , and is , must ever be —</l>
     <l n="86">But I 'm digressing , pardon me .</l>
     <l n="87">I knew not anything of love</l>
     <l n="88">In those days , but of that above</l>
     <l n="89">All worldly passion ,— for my art —</l>
     <l n="90">Music ,— and that , with all my heart</l>
     <l n="91">And soul , blent in a love too great</l>
     <l n="92">For words of mine to estimate .</l>
     <l n="93">And though among my pupils she</l>
     <l n="94">Whose love my friend sought came to me</l>
     <l n="95">I only knew her fingers ’ touch</l>
     <l n="96">Because they loitered overmuch</l>
     <l n="97">In simple scales , and needs must be</l>
     <l n="98">Untangled almost constantly .</l>
     <l n="99">But she was bright in other ways ,</l>
     <l n="100">And quick of thought , with ready plays</l>
     <l n="101">Of wit , and with a voice as sweet</l>
     <l n="102">To listen to as one might meet</l>
     <l n="103">In any oratorio —</l>
     <l n="104">And once I gravely told her so ,—</l>
     <l n="105">And , at my words , her limpid tone</l>
     <l n="106">Of laughter faltered to a moan ,</l>
     <l n="107">And fell from that into a sigh</l>
     <l n="108">That quavered all so wearily ,</l>
     <l n="109">That I , without the tear that crept</l>
     <l n="110">Between the keys , had known she wept ;</l>
     <l n="111">And yet the hand I reached for then</l>
     <l n="112">She caught away , and laughed again .</l>
     <l n="113">And when that evening I strolled</l>
     <l n="114">With my old friend , I , smiling , told</l>
     <l n="115">Him I believed the girl and he</l>
     <l n="116">Were matched and mated perfectly :</l>
     <l n="117">He was so noble ; she , so fair</l>
     <l n="118">Of speech , and womanly of air ;</l>
     <l n="119">He , strong , ambitious ; she , as mild</l>
     <l n="120">And artless even as a child ;</l>
     <l n="121">And with a nature , I was sure ,</l>
     <l n="122">As worshipful as it was pure</l>
     <l n="123">And sweet , and brimmed with tender things</l>
     <l n="124">Beyond his rarest fancyings .</l>
     <l n="125">He stopped me solemnly . He knew ,</l>
     <l n="126">He said , how good , and just , and true</l>
     <l n="127">Was all I said of her ; but as</l>
     <l n="128">For his own virtues , let them pass ,</l>
     <l n="129">Since they were nothing to the one</l>
     <l n="130">That he had set his heart upon ;</l>
     <l n="131">For but that morning she had turned</l>
     <l n="132">Forever from him . Then I learned</l>
     <l n="133">That for a month he had delayed</l>
     <l n="134">His going from us , with no aid</l>
     <l n="135">Of hope to hold him ,— meeting still</l>
     <l n="136">Her ever firm denial , till</l>
     <l n="137">Not even in his new-found sight</l>
     <l n="138">He found one comfort or delight .</l>
     <l n="139">And as his voice broke there , I felt</l>
     <l n="140">The brother-heart within me melt</l>
     <l n="141">In warm compassion for his own</l>
     <l n="142">That throbbed so utterly alone .</l>
     <l n="143">And then a sudden fancy hit</l>
     <l n="144">Along my brain ; and coupling it</l>
     <l n="145">With a belief that I , indeed ,</l>
     <l n="146">Might help my friend in his great need ,</l>
     <l n="147">I warmly said that I would go</l>
     <l n="148">Myself , if he decided so ,</l>
     <l n="149">And see her for him — that I knew</l>
     <l n="150">My pleadings would be listened to</l>
     <l n="151">Most seriously , and that she</l>
     <l n="152">Should love him , listening to me .</l>
     <l n="153">Go ; bless me ! And that was the last —</l>
     <l n="154">The last time his warm hand shut fast</l>
     <l n="155">Within my own — so empty since ,</l>
     <l n="156">That the remembered finger-prints</l>
     <l n="157">I ‘ ve kissed a thousand times , and wet</l>
     <l n="158">Them with the tears of all regret !</l>

     <l n="164">Above the chair in which she sat</l>

     <l n="166">And held it for a moment , and</l>
     <l n="167">Took up the other — held them both —</l>
     <l n="168">As might a friend , I will take oath :</l>

     <l n="173">Most truly loved her ; one whose fond</l>
     <l n="174">Clear-sighted vision looked beyond</l>

     <l n="176">And saw the woman , perfectly</l>

     <l n="178">And lovable . She quailed , and drew</l>
     <l n="179">Her hands away , but closer still</l>
     <l n="180">I caught them . “ Rack me as you will ! ”</l>
     <l n="181">She cried out sharply — “ Call me ‘ blind ’ —</l>
     <l n="182">Love ever is — I am resigned !</l>
     <l n="183">Blind is your friend ; as blind as he</l>

     <l n="25">He quits his pipe , and he snaps its neck —</l>

     <l n="28">With a reeling mast o'erhead !</l>
     <l n="29">Ho ! the old sea captain 's cheeks glow warm ,</l>

     <l n="1">The man that rooms next door to me :</l>
     <l n="2">Two weeks ago , this very night ,</l>
     <l n="3">He took possession quietly ,</l>
     <l n="4">As any other lodger might —</l>
     <l n="5">But why the room next mine should so</l>
     <l n="6">Attract him I was vexed to know ,—</l>
     <l n="7">Because his quietude , in fine ,</l>

     <l n="12">He shuts his door so noiselessly ,</l>
     <l n="13">And glides about so very mute ,</l>
     <l n="14">In each mysterious pursuit ,</l>
     <l n="15">His silence is oppressive , and</l>
     <l n="16">Too deep for me to understand . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Sometimes , forgetting book or pen ,</l>
     <l n="18">I 've found my head in breathless poise</l>
     <l n="19">Lifted , and dropped in shame again ,</l>
     <l n="20">Hearing some alien ghost of noise —</l>
     <l n="21">Some smothered sound that seemed to be</l>
     <l n="22">A trunk-lid dropped unguardedly ,</l>
     <l n="23">Or the crisp writhings of some quire</l>
     <l n="24">Of manuscript thrust in the fire .</l>

     <l n="25">Then I have climbed , and closed in vain</l>

     <l n="28">Have pressed my fevered face ,— but all</l>
     <l n="29">The day or night without held not</l>
     <l n="30">A sight or sound or counter-thought</l>

     <l n="36">The muffled noises , and the light</l>
     <l n="37">And tireless movements of this guest</l>
     <l n="38">Whose silence raged above my rest</l>
     <l n="39">Hoarser than howling storms at sea —</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">But twice or thrice , upon the stair ,</l>
     <l n="42">I 've seen his face — most strangely wan ,—</l>
     <l n="43">Each time upon me unaware</l>
     <l n="44">He came — smooth 'd past me , and was gone .</l>
     <l n="45">So like a whisper he went by ,</l>
     <l n="46">I listened after , ear and eye ,</l>
     <l n="47">Nor could my chafing fancy tell</l>
     <l n="48">The meaning of one syllable .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="49">Last night I caught him , face to face ,—</l>
     <l n="50">He entering his room , and I</l>
     <l n="51">Glaring from mine : He paused a space</l>
     <l n="52">And met my scowl all shrinkingly ,</l>
     <l n="53">But with full gentleness : The key</l>
     <l n="54">Turned in his door — and I could see</l>
     <l n="55">It tremblingly withdrawn and put</l>
     <l n="56">Inside , and then — the door was shut .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="57">Then silence . Silence !— why , last night</l>
     <l n="58">The silence was tumultuous ,</l>
     <l n="59">And thundered on till broad daylight ;—</l>
     <l n="60">O never has it stunned me thus !—</l>
     <l n="61">It rolls , and moans , and mumbles yet .—</l>
     <l n="62">Ah , God ! how loud may silence get</l>

     <l n="64">Who answers but as silence can !</l>

     <l n="65">The silence grew , and grew , and grew ,</l>
     <l n="66">Till at high noon to-day ‘ twas heard</l>
     <l n="67">Throughout the house ; and men flocked through</l>
     <l n="68">The echoing halls , with faces blurred</l>
     <l n="69">With pallor , gloom , and fear , and awe ,</l>
     <l n="70">And shuddering at what they saw —</l>
     <l n="71">The quiet lodger , as he lay</l>
     <l n="72">Stark of the life he cast away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="73">So strange to-night — those voices there ,</l>
     <l n="74">Where all so quiet was before ;</l>
     <l n="75">They say the face has not a care</l>
     <l n="76">Nor sorrow in it any more —</l>
     <l n="77">His latest scrawl :— “ Forgive me — You</l>
     <l n="78">Who prayed , ‘ they know not what they do ! ’ ”</l>
     <l n="79">My tears wilt never let me see</l>

   <p>Grand Haven is in Michigan , and in possession , too , Of as many rare attractions as our party ever knew :— The fine hotel , the landlord , and the lordly bill of fare , And the dainty-neat completeness of the pretty waiters there ; The touch on the piano in the parlor , and the trill Of the exquisite soprano , in our fancy singing still ; Our cozy room , its comfort , and our thousand grateful tho'ts , And at our door the gentle face Of H. Y. Potts !</p>
   <p>His artless observations , and his drollery of style , Bewildered with that sorrowful serenity of smile — The eye 's elusive twinkle , and the twitching of the lid , Like he did n't go to say it and was sorry that he did . O Artemus of Michigan ! so worthy of the name , Our manager indorses it , and Bill Nye does the same — You tickled our affection in so many tender spots That even Recollection laughs At H. Y. Potts !</p>
   <p>And hark ye ! O Grand Haven ! count your rare attractions o'er — The commerce of your ships at sea , and ships along the shore ; Your railroads , and your industries , and interests untold , Your Opera House — our lecture , and the gate-receipts in gold !— Ay , Banner Town of Michigan ! count all your treasures through — Your crowds of summer tourists , and your Sanitarium , too ; Your lake , your beach , your drives , your breezy groves and grassy plots , But head the list of all of these With H.

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">He left his house but seldom — then</l>
     <l n="22">Would always hurry back again ,</l>
     <l n="23">As though he feared some stranger 's knock ,</l>

     <l n="25">Beside , he carried , every day ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">And so we grew to greatly blame</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">But when he died — he died one day —</l>
     <l n="34">Dropped in the street while on his way</l>
     <l n="35">To that old wretched hut of his —</l>
     <l n="36">You 'll think it strange — perhaps it is —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">But when we lifted him , and past</l>
     <l n="38">The threshold of his home at last ,</l>
     <l n="39">No man of all the crowd but stepped</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">What was it ? Just a shriek of pain</l>

     <l n="43">A withered woman , old and bowed ,</l>
     <l n="44">That fell and crawled and cried aloud —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="45">And kissed the dead man 's matted hair —</l>
     <l n="46">Lifted his face and kissed him there —</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="49">Insane ? Yes .— Well , we , searching , found</l>

     <l n="1">When Age comes on !—</l>
     <l n="2">“ The deepening dusk is where the dawn</l>
     <l n="3">Once glittered splendid , and the dew</l>
     <l n="4">In honey-drips , from red rose-lips</l>
     <l n="5">Was kissed away by me and you .—</l>
     <l n="6">And now across the frosty lawn</l>
     <l n="7">Black foot-prints trail , and Age comes on —</l>
     <l n="8">And Age comes on !</l>
     <l n="9">And biting wild-winds whistle through</l>
     <l n="10">Our tattered hopes — and Age comes on !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">When Age comes on !—</l>
     <l n="12">O tide of raptures , long withdrawn ,</l>
     <l n="13">Flow back in summer-floods , and fling</l>
     <l n="14">Here at our feet our childhood sweet ,</l>
     <l n="15">And all the songs we used to sing ! . . .</l>
     <l n="16">Old loves , old friends — all dead and gone —</l>
     <l n="17">Our old faith lost — and Age comes on —</l>
     <l n="18">And Age comes on !</l>
     <l n="19">Poor hearts ! have we not anything</l>
     <l n="20">But longings left when Age comes on ?</l>
