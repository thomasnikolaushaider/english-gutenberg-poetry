    <head>INTRODUCTION BY HENRY MORLEY .</head>
    <p n="1">Once more our readers are indebted to a living poet for wide circulation of a volume of delightful verse . The name of Aubrey de Vere is the more pleasantly familiar because its association with our highest literature has descended from father to son . In 1822 , sixty-seven years ago , Sir Aubrey de Vere , of Curragh Chase , by Adare , in the county of Limerick — then thirty-four years old — first made his mark with a dramatic poem upon “ Julian the Apostate . ” In 1842 Sir Aubrey published Sonnets , which his friend Wordsworth described as “ the most perfect of our age ; ” and in the year of his death he completed a dramatic poem upon “ Mary Tudor , ” published in the next year , 1847 , with the “ Lamentation of Ireland , and other Poems . ” Sir Aubrey de Vere 's “ Mary Tudor ” should be read by all who have read Tennyson 's play on the same subject .</p>
    <p n="2">The gift of genius passed from Sir Aubrey to his third son , Aubrey Thomas de Vere , who was born in 1814 , and through a long life has put into music only noble thoughts associated with the love of God and man , and of his native land . His first work , published forty - seven years ago , was a lyrical piece , in which he gave his sympathy to devout and persecuted men whose ways of thought were not his own . Aubrey de Vere 's poems have been from time to time revised by himself , and they were in 1884 finally collected into three volumes , published by Messrs. Kegan Paul . Left free to choose from among their various contents , I have taken this little book of “ Legends of St. Patrick , ” first published in 1872 , but in so doing I have unwillingly left many a piece that would please many a reader .</p>
    <p n="3">They are not , however , inaccessible . Of the three volumes of collected works , each may be had separately , and is complete in itself . The first contains “ The Search after Proserpine , and other Poems — Classical and Meditative . ” The second contains the “ Legends of St. Patrick , and Legends of Ireland 's Heroic Age , ” including a version of the “ Tain Bo . ” The third contains two plays , “ Alexander the Great , ” “ St. Thomas of Canterbury , ” and other Poems .</p>
    <p n="4">For the convenience of some readers , the following extract from the second volume of my “ English Writers , ” may serve as a prosaic summary of what is actually known about St. Patrick . H. M .</p>
    <p n="5">ST. PATRICK .</p>
    <p n="6">FROM “ ENGLISH WRITERS . ”</p>
    <p n="7">The birth of St. Patrick , Apostle and Saint of Ireland , has been generally placed in the latter half of the fourth century ; and he is said to have died at the age of a hundred and twenty . As he died in the year 493 — and we may admit that he was then a very old man — if we may say that he reached the age of eighty-eight , we place his birth in the year 405 . We may reasonably believe , therefore , that he was born in the early part of the fifth century . His birthplace , now known as Kilpatrick , was at the junction of the Levin with the Clyde , in what is now the county of Dumbarton . His baptismal name was Succath . His father was Calphurnius , a deacon , son of Potitus , who was a priest . His mother 's name was Conchessa , whose family may have belonged to Gaul , and who may thus have been , as it is said she was , of the kindred of St. Martin of Tours ; for there is a tradition that she was with Calphurnius as a slave before he married her . Since Eusebius spoke of three bishops from Britain at the Council of Arles , Succath , known afterwards in missionary life by his name in religion , Patricius ( pater civium ) , might very reasonably be a deacon 's son .</p>
    <p n="8">In his early years Succath was at home by the Clyde , and he speaks of himself as not having been obedient to the teaching of the clergy . When he was sixteen years old he , with two of his sisters and other of his countrymen , was seized by a band of Irish pirates that made descent on the shore of the Clyde and carried him off to slavery . His sisters were taken to another part of the island , and he was sold to Milcho MacCuboin in the north , whom he served for six or seven years , so learning to speak the language of the country , while keeping his master 's sheep by the Mountain of Slieve Miss . Thoughts of home and of its Christian life made the youth feel the heathenism that was about him ; his exile seemed to him a punishment for boyish indifference ; and during the years when young enthusiasm looks out upon life with new sense of a man 's power — growing for man 's work that is to do — Succath became filled with religious zeal .</p>
    <p n="9">Three Latin pieces are ascribed to St. Patrick : a “ Confession , ” which is in the Book of Armagh , and in three other manuscripts ; { 10a } a letter to Coroticus , and a few “ Dieta Patricii , ” which are also in the Book of Armagh . { 10b } There is no strong reason for questioning the authenticity of the “ Confession , ” which is in unpolished Latin , the writer calling himself “ indoctus , rusticissimus , imperitus , ” and it is full of a deep religious feeling . It is concerned rather with the inner than the outer life , but includes references to the early days of trial by which Succath 's whole heart was turned to God . He says , “ After I came into Ireland I pastured sheep daily , and prayed many times a day . The love and fear of God , and faith and spirit , wrought in me more and more , so that in one day I reached to a hundred prayers , and in the night almost as many , and stayed in the woods and on the mountains , and was urged to prayer before the dawn , in snow , in frost , in rain , and took no harm , nor , I think , was there any sloth in me . And there one night I heard a voice in a dream saying to me , ‘ Thou hast well fasted ; thou shalt go back soon to thine own land ; ’ and again after a little while , ‘ Behold ! thy ship is ready . ’ ” In all this there is the passionate longing of an ardent mind for home and Heaven .</p>
    <p n="10">At the age of twenty-two Succath fled from his slavery to a vessel of which the master first refused and finally consented to take him on board . He and the sailors were then cast by a storm upon a desert shore of Britain , possibly upon some region laid waste by ravages from over sea . Having at last made his way back , by a sea passage , to his home on the Clyde , Succath was after a time captured again , but remained captive only for two months , and went back home . Then the zeal for his Master 's service made him feel like the Seafarer in the Anglo-Saxon poem ; and all the traditions of his home would have accorded with the rise of the resolve to cross the sea , and to spread Christ 's teaching in what had been the land of his captivity .</p>
    <p n="11">There were already centres of Christian work in Ireland , where devoted men were labouring and drew a few into their fellowship . Succath aimed at the gathering of all these scattered forces , by a movement that should carry with it the whole people . He first prepared himself by giving about four years to study of the Scriptures at Auxerre , under Germanus , and then went to Rome , under the conduct of a priest , Segetius , and probably with letters from Germanus to Pope Celestine . Whether he received his orders from the Pope seems doubtful ; but the evidence is strong that Celestine sent him on his Irish mission . Succath left Rome , passed through North Italy and Gaul , till he met on his way two followers of Palladius , Augustinus and Benedictus , who told him of their master 's failure , and of his death at Fordun . Succath then obtained consecration from Amathus , a neighbouring bishop , and as Patricius , went straight to Ireland . He landed near the town of Wicklow , by the estuary of the River Varty , which had been the landing-place of Palladius . In that region he was , like Palladius , opposed ; but he made some conversions , and advanced with his work northward that he might reach the home of his old master , Milcho , and pay him the purchase - money of his stolen freedom . But Milcho , it is said , burnt himself and his goods rather than bear the shame of submission to the growing power of his former slave .</p>
    <p n="12">St. Patrick addressed the ruling classes , who could bring with them their followers , and he joined tact with his zeal ; respecting ancient prejudices , opposing nothing that was not directly hostile to the spirit of Christianity , and handling skilfully the chiefs with whom he had to deal . An early convert — Dichu MacTrighim — was a chief with influential connections , who gave the ground for the religious house now known as Saul . This chief satisfied so well the inquiries of Laeghaire , son of Niall , King of Erin , concerning the stranger 's movements , that St. Patrick took ship for the mouth of the Boyne , and made his way straight to the king himself . The result of his energy was that he met successfully all the opposition of those who were concerned in the maintenance of old heathen worship , and brought King Laeghaire to his side .</p>
    <p n="13">Then Laeghaire resolved that the old laws of the country as established by the judges , whose order was named Brehon , should be revised , and brought into accord with the new teaching . So the Brehon laws of Ireland were revised , with St. Patrick 's assistance , and there were no ancient customs broken or altered , except those that could not be harmonised with Christian teaching . The good sense of St. Patrick enabled this great work to be done without offence to the people . The collection of laws thus made by the chief lawyers of the time , with the assistance of St. Patrick , is known as the “ Senchus Mor , ” and , says an old poem -</p>
    <p n="14">“ Laeghaire , Corc Dairi , the brave ; Patrick , Beuen , Cairnech , the just ; Rossa , Dubtach , Fergus , the wise ; These are the nine pillars of the Senchus Mor . ”</p>
    <p n="15">This body of laws , traditions , and treatises on law is found in no manuscript of a date earlier than the fourteenth century . It includes , therefore , much that is of later date than the fifth century .</p>
    <p n="16">St. Patrick 's greatest energies are said to have been put forth in Ulster and Leinster . Among the churches or religious communities founded by him in Ulster was that of Armagh . If he was born about the year 405 , when he was carried to Ireland as a prisoner at the age of sixteen the date would have been 421 . His age would have been twenty-two when he escaped , after six or seven years of captivity , and the date 427 . A year at home , and four years with Germanus at Auxerre , would bring him to the age of twenty-seven , and the year 432 , when he began his great endeavour to put Christianity into the main body of the Irish people . That work filled all the rest of his life , which was long . If we accept the statement , in which all the old records agree , that the time of Patrick 's labour in Ireland was not less than sixty years ; sixty years bring him to the age of eighty-eight in the year 493 . And in that year he died .</p>
    <p n="17">The “ Letter to Coroticus , ” ascribed to St. Patrick , is addressed to a petty king of Brittany who persecuted Christians , and was meant for the encouragement of Christian soldiers who served under him . It may , probably , be regarded as authentic . The mass of legend woven into the life of the great missionary lies outside this piece and the “ Confession . ” The “ Confession ” only expresses heights and depths of religious feeling haunted by impressions and dreams , through which , to the fervid nature out of which they sprang heaven seemed to speak . St. Patrick did not attack heresies among the Christians ; he preached to those who were not Christians the Christian faith and practice . His great influence was not that of a writer , but of a speaker . He must have been an orator , profoundly earnest , who could put his soul into his voice ; and , when his words bred deeds , conquered all difficulties in the way of action with right feeling and good sense .

     <p>TO THE MEMORY OF WORDSWORTH . AUTHOR 'S PREFACE TO “ THE LEGENDS OF SAINT PATRICK . ” The ancient records of Ireland abound in legends respecting the greatest man and the greatest benefactor that ever trod her soil ; and of these the earlier are at once the more authentic and the nobler . Not a few have a character of the sublime ; many are pathetic ; some have a profound meaning under a strange disguise ; but their predominant character is their brightness and gladsomeness . A large tract of Irish history is dark : but the time of Saint Patrick , and the three centuries which succeeded it , were her time of joy . That chronicle is a song of gratitude and hope , as befits the story of a nation 's conversion to Christianity , and in it the bird and the brook blend their carols with those of angels and of men . It was otherwise with the later legends connecting Ossian with Saint Patrick . A poet once remarked , while studying the frescoes of Michael Angelo in the Sistine Chapel , that the Sibyls are always sad , while the Prophets alternated with them are joyous . In the legends of the Patrician Cycle the chief-loving old Bard is ever mournful , for his face is turned to the past glories of his country ; while the Saint is always bright , because his eyes are set on to the glory that has no end . These legends are to be found chiefly in several very ancient lives of Saint Patrick , the most valuable of which is the “ Tripartite Life , ” ascribed by Colgan to the century after the Saint 's death , though it has not escaped later interpolations . The work was long lost , but two copies of it were re-discovered , one of which has been recently translated by that eminent Irish scholar , Mr. Hennessy . Whether regarded from the religious or the philosophic point of view , few things can be more instructive than the picture which it delineates of human nature at a period of critical transition , and the dawning of the Religion of Peace upon a race barbaric , but far indeed from savage . That wild race regarded it doubtless as a notable cruelty when the new Faith discouraged an amusement so popular as battle ; but in many respects they were in sympathy with that Faith . It was one in which the nobler affections , as well as the passions , retained an unblunted ardour ; and where Nature is strongest and least corrupted it most feels the need of something higher than itself , its interpreter and its supplement . It prized the family ties , like the Germans recorded by Tacitus ; and it could not but have been drawn to Christianity , which consecrated them . Its morals were pure , and it had not lost that simplicity to which so much of spiritual insight belongs . Admiration and wonder were among its chief habits ; and it would not have been repelled by Mysteries in what professed to belong to the Infinite . Lawless as it was , it abounded also in loyalty , generosity , and self-sacrifice ; it was not , therefore , untouched by the records of martyrs , examples of self-sacrifice , or the doctrine of a great Sacrifice . It loved children and the poor ; and Christianity made the former the exemplars of faith , and the latter the eminent inheritors of the Kingdom . On the other hand , all the vices of the race ranged themselves against the new religion . In the main the institutions and traditions of Ireland were favourable to Christianity . She had preserved in a large measure the patriarchal system of the East . Her clans were families , and her chiefs were patriarchs who led their households to battle , and seized or recovered the spoil . To such a people the Christian Church announced herself as a great family — the family of man . Her genealogies went up to the first parent , and her rule was parental rule . The kingdom of Christ was the household of Christ ; and its children in all lands formed the tribes of a larger Israel . Its laws were living traditions ; and for traditions the Irish had ever retained the Eastern reverence . In the Druids no formidable enemy was found ; it was the Bards who wielded the predominant social influence . As in Greece , where the sacerdotal power was small , the Bards were the priests of the national Imagination , and round them all moral influences had gathered themselves . They were jealous of their rivals ; but those rivals won them by degrees . Secknall and Fiacc were Christian Bards , trained by St. Patrick , who is said to have also brought a bard with him from Italy . The beautiful legend in which the Saint loosened the tongue of the dumb child was an apt emblem of Christianity imparting to the Irish race the highest use of its natural faculties . The Christian clergy turned to account the Irish traditions , as they had made use of the Pagan temples , purifying them first . The Christian religion looked with a genuine kindness on whatever was human , except so far as the stain was on it ; and while it resisted to the face what was unchristian in spirit , it also , in the Apostolic sense , “ made itself all things to all men . ” As legislator , Saint Patrick waged no needless war against the ancient laws of Ireland . He purified them , and he amplified them , discarding only what was unfit for a nation made Christian . Thus was produced the great “ Book of the Law , ” or “ Senchus Mohr , ” compiled A. D. 439 . The Irish received the Gospel gladly . The great and the learned , in other nations the last to believe , among them commonly set the example . With the natural disposition of the race an appropriate culture had concurred . It was one which at least did not fail to develop the imagination , the affections , and a great part of the moral being , and which thus indirectly prepared ardent natures , and not less the heroic than the tender , to seek their rest in spiritual things , rather than in material or conventional . That culture , without removing the barbaric , had blended it with the refined . It had created among the people an appreciation of the beautiful , the pathetic , and the pure . The early Irish chronicles , as well as songs , show how strong among them that sentiment had ever been . The Borromean Tribute , for so many ages the source of relentless wars , had been imposed in vengeance for an insult offered to a woman ; and a discourtesy shown to a poet had overthrown an ancient dynasty . The education of an Ollambh occupied twelve years ; and in the third century , the time of Oiseen and Fionn , the military rules of the Feine included provisions which the chivalry of later ages might have been proud of . It was a wild , but not wholly an ungentle time . An unprovoked affront was regarded as a grave moral offence ; and severe punishments were ordained , not only for detraction , but for a word , though uttered in jest , which brought a blush on the cheek of a listener . Yet an injury a hundred years old could meet no forgiveness , and the life of man was war ! It was not that laws were wanting ; a code , minute in its justice , had proportioned a penalty to every offence , and specified the Eric which was to wipe out the bloodstain in case the injured party renounced his claim to right his own wrong . It was not that hearts were hard — there was at least as much pity for others as for self . It was that anger was implacable , and that where fear was unknown , the war field was what among us the hunting field is . The rapid growth of learning as well as piety in the three centuries succeeding the conversion of Ireland , prove that the country had not been till then without a preparation for the gift . It had been the special skill of Saint Patrick to build the good which was lacked upon that which existed . Even the material arts of Ireland he had pressed into the service of the Faith ; and Irish craftsmen had assisted him , not only in the building of his churches , but in casting his church bells , and in the adornment of his chalices , crosiers , and ecclesiastical vestments . Once elevated by Christianity , Ireland 's early civilisation was a memorable thing . It sheltered a high virtue at home , and evangelised a great part of Northern Europe ; and amidst many confusions it held its own till the true time of barbarism had set in — those two disastrous centuries when the Danish invasions trod down the sanctuaries , dispersed the libraries , and laid waste the colleges to which distant kings had sent their sons . Perhaps nothing human had so large an influence in the conversion of the Irish as the personal character of her Apostle . Where others , as Palladius , had failed , he succeeded . By nature , by grace , and by providential training , he had been specially fitted for his task . We can still see plainly even the finer traits of that character , while the land of his birth is a matter of dispute , and of his early history we know little , except that he was of noble birth , that he was carried to Ireland by pirates at the age of sixteen , and that after five years of bondage he escaped thence , to return A. D. 432 , when about forty-five years old ; belonging thus to that great age of the Church which was made illustrious by the most eminent of its Fathers , and tasked by the most critical of its trials . In him a great character had been built on the foundations of a devout childhood , and of a youth ennobled by adversity . Everywhere we trace the might and the sweetness which belonged to it , the versatile mind yet the simple heart , the varying tact yet the fixed resolve , the large design taking counsel for all , yet the minute solicitude for each , the fiery zeal yet the genial temper , the skill in using means yet the reliance on God alone , the readiness in action with the willingness to wait , the habitual self-possession yet the outbursts of an inspiration which raised him above himself , the abiding consciousness of authority — an authority in him , but not of him — and yet the ever-present humility . Above all , there burned in him that boundless love , which seems the main constituent of the Apostolic character . It was love for God ; but it was love for man also , an impassioned love , and a parental compassion . It was not for the spiritual weal alone of man that he thirsted . Wrong and injustice to the poor he resented as an injury to God . His vehement love for the poor is illustrated by his “ Epistle to Coroticus , ” reproaching him with his cruelty , as well as by his denunciations of slavery , which piracy had introduced into parts of Ireland . No wonder that such a character should have exercised a talismanic power over the ardent and sensitive race among whom he laboured , a race “ easy to be drawn , but impossible to be driven , ” and drawn more by sympathy than even by benefits . That character can only be understood by one who studies , and in a right spirit , that account of his life which he bequeathed to us shortly before its close — the “ Confession of Saint Patrick . ” The last poem in this series embodies its most characteristic portions , including the visions which it records . The “ Tripartite Life ” thus ends : — “ After these great miracles , therefore , after resuscitating the dead , after healing lepers , and the blind , and the deaf , and the lame , and all diseases ; after ordaining bishops , and priests , and deacons , and people of all orders in the Church ; after teaching the men of Erin , and after baptising them ; after founding churches and monasteries ; after destroying idols and images and Druidical arts , the hour of death of Saint Patrick approached . He received the body of Christ from the Bishop Tassach , according to the counsel of the Angel Victor . He resigned his spirit afterwards to Heaven , in the one hundred and twentieth year of his age . His body is still here in the earth , with honour and reverence . Though great his honour here , greater honour will be to him in the Day of Judgment , when judgment will be given on the fruit of his teaching , as of every great Apostle , in the union of the Apostles and Disciples of Jesus ; in the union of the Nine Orders of Angels , which cannot be surpassed ; in the union of the Divinity and Humanity of the Son of God ; in the union , which is higher than all unions , of the Holy Trinity , Father , Son , and Holy Ghost . ” A . DE VERE .</p>

    <head>Fame of St. Patrick goes ever before him , and men of goodwill believe gladly ; but Milcho , a mighty merchant , and one given wholly to pride and greed , wills to disbelieve . St. Patrick sends him greeting and gifts ; but he , discovering that the prophet welcomed by all had once been his slave , hates him the more . Notwithstanding , he fears that when that prophet arrives , he , too , may be forced to believe , though against his will . He resolves to set fire to his castle and all his wealth , and make new fortunes in far lands . The doom of Milcho , who willed to disbelieve .</head>

     <l n="11">Laughed with his latest beam . The hours went by :</l>
     <l n="12">The brethren paced the shore or musing sat ,</l>
     <l n="13">But still their Patriarch knelt and still gave thanks</l>
     <l n="14">For all the marvellous chances of his life</l>
     <l n="15">Since those his earlier years when , slave new-trapped ,</l>
     <l n="16">He comforted on hills of Dalaraide</l>
     <l n="17">His hungry heart with God , and , cleansed by pain ,</l>
     <l n="18">In exile found the spirit 's native land .</l>
     <l n="19">Eve deepened into night , and still he prayed :</l>
     <l n="20">The clear cold stars had crowned the azure vault ;</l>
     <l n="21">And , risen at midnight from dark seas , the moon</l>
     <l n="22">Had quenched those stars , yet Patrick still prayed on :</l>
     <l n="23">Till from the river murmuring in the vale ,</l>
     <l n="24">Far off , and from the morning airs close by</l>
     <l n="25">That shook the alders by the river 's mouth ,</l>
     <l n="26">And from his own deep heart a voice there came ,</l>
     <l n="27">“ Ere yet thou fling'st God 's bounty on this land</l>
     <l n="28">There is a debt to cancel . Where is he ,</l>
     <l n="29">Thy five years ’ lord that scourged thee for his swine ?</l>
     <l n="30">Alas that wintry face ! Alas that heart</l>
     <l n="31">Joyless since earliest youth ! To him reveal it !</l>
     <l n="32">To him declare that God who Man became</l>
     <l n="33">To raise man 's fall'n estate , as though a man ,</l>
     <l n="34">All faculties of man unmerged , undimmed ,</l>
     <l n="35">Had changed to worm and died the prey of worms ,</l>
     <l n="36">That so the mole might see ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="37">Thus Patrick mused</l>
     <l n="38">Not ignorant that from low beginnings rise</l>
     <l n="39">Oftenest the works of greatness ; yet of this</l>
     <l n="40">Unweeting , that his failure , one and sole</l>
     <l n="41">Through all his more than mortal course , even now</l>
     <l n="42">Before that low beginning 's threshold lay ,</l>
     <l n="43">Betwixt it and that Promised Land beyond</l>
     <l n="44">A bar of scandal stretched . Not otherwise</l>
     <l n="45">Might whatsoe'er was mortal in his strength</l>
     <l n="46">Dying , put on the immortal .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="47">With the morn</l>
     <l n="48">Deep sleep descended on him . Waking soon ,</l>
     <l n="49">He rose a man of might , and in that might</l>
     <l n="50">Laboured ; and God His servant 's toil revered ;</l>
     <l n="51">And gladly on that coast Erin to Christ</l>
     <l n="52">Paid her firstfruits . Three days he preached his Lord :</l>
     <l n="53">The fourth embarking , cape succeeding cape</l>
     <l n="54">They passed , and heard the lowing herds remote</l>
     <l n="55">In hollow glens , and smelt the balmy breath</l>
     <l n="56">Of gorse on golden hillsides ; till at eve ,</l>
     <l n="57">The Imber Domnand reached , on silver sands</l>
     <l n="58">Grated their keel . Around them flocked at dawn</l>
     <l n="59">Warriors with hunters mixed , and shepherd youths</l>
     <l n="60">And maids with lips as red as mountain berries</l>
     <l n="61">And eyes like sloes , or keener eyes , dark-fringed</l>
     <l n="62">And gleaming like the blue-black spear . They came</l>
     <l n="63">With milk-pail , and with kid , and kindled fire</l>
     <l n="64">And spread the genial board . Upon that shore</l>
     <l n="65">Full many knelt and gave themselves to Christ ,</l>
     <l n="66">Strong men , and men at midmost of their hopes</l>
     <l n="67">By sickness felled ; old chiefs , at life 's dim close</l>
     <l n="68">That oft had asked , “ Beyond the grave what hope ? ”</l>
     <l n="69">Worn sailors weary of the toilsome seas ,</l>
     <l n="70">And craving rest ; they , too , that sex which wears</l>
     <l n="71">The blended crowns of Chastity and Love ;</l>
     <l n="72">Wondering , they hailed the Maiden-Motherhood ;</l>
     <l n="73">And listening children praised the Babe Divine ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="75">Ere long , once more</l>
     <l n="76">Their sails were spread . Again by grassy marge</l>
     <l n="77">They rowed , and sylvan glades . The branching deer</l>
     <l n="78">Like flying gleams went by them . Oft the cry</l>
     <l n="79">Of fighting clans rang out : but oftener yet</l>
     <l n="80">Clamour of rural dance , or mart confused</l>
     <l n="81">With many-coloured garb and movements swift ,</l>
     <l n="82">Pageant sun-bright : or on the sands a throng</l>
     <l n="83">Girdled with circle glad some bard whose song</l>
     <l n="84">Shook the wild clan as tempest shakes the woods .</l>
     <l n="85">Still north the wanderers sailed : at evening , mists</l>
     <l n="86">Cumbered the shore and on them leaned the blast ,</l>
     <l n="87">And fierce rain flashed mingling with dim-lit sea .</l>
     <l n="88">All night they toiled ; next day at noon they kenned</l>
     <l n="89">A seaward stream that shone like golden tress</l>
     <l n="90">Severed and random-thrown . That river 's mouth</l>
     <l n="91">Ere long attained was all with lilies white</l>
     <l n="92">As April field with daisies . Entering there</l>
     <l n="93">They reached a wood , and disembarked with joy :</l>
     <l n="94">There , after thanks to God , silent they sat</l>
     <l n="95">In thought , and watched the ripples , dusk yet bright ,</l>
     <l n="96">That lived and died like things that laughed at time ,</l>
     <l n="97">On gliding ‘ neath those many-centuried boughs .</l>
     <l n="98">But , midmost , Patrick slept . Then through the trees ,</l>
     <l n="99">Shy as a fawn half-tamed now stole , now fled</l>
     <l n="100">A boy of such bright aspect faery child</l>
     <l n="101">He seemed , or babe exposed of royal race :</l>
     <l n="102">At last assured beside the Saint he stood ,</l>
     <l n="103">And dropped on him a flower , and disappeared :</l>
     <l n="104">Thus flower on flower from the great wood he brought</l>
     <l n="105">And hid them in the bosom of the Saint .</l>
     <l n="106">The monks forbade him , saying , “ Lest thou wake</l>
     <l n="107">The master from his sleep . ” But Patrick woke ,</l>
     <l n="108">And saw the boy , and said , “ Forbid him not ;</l>
     <l n="109">The heir of all my kingdom is this child . ”</l>
     <l n="110">Then spake the brethren , “ Wilt thou walk with us ? ”</l>
     <l n="111">And he , “ I will : ” and so for his sweet face</l>
     <l n="112">They called his name Benignus : and the boy</l>
     <l n="113">Thenceforth was Christ 's . Beneath his parent 's roof</l>
     <l n="114">At night they housed . Nowhere that child would sleep</l>
     <l n="115">Except at Patrick 's feet . Till Patrick 's death</l>

     <l n="121">Before them rose : but nearer at their left</l>
     <l n="122">Inland with westward channel wound the wave</l>
     <l n="123">Changed to sea-lake . Nine miles with chant and hymn</l>
     <l n="124">They tracked the gold path of the sinking sun ;</l>
     <l n="125">Then southward ran ‘ twixt headland and green isle</l>
     <l n="126">And landed . Dewy pastures sunset-dazed ,</l>
     <l n="127">At leisure paced by mild-eyed milk-white kine</l>
     <l n="128">Smiled them a welcome . Onward moved in sight</l>
     <l n="129">Swiftly , with shadow far before him cast ,</l>
     <l n="130">Dichu , that region 's lord , a martial man</l>

     <l n="132">Pirates he deemed them first and toward them faced</l>
     <l n="133">With wolf-hounds twain that watched their master 's eye</l>
     <l n="134">To spring , or not to spring . The imperious face</l>
     <l n="135">Forbidding not , they sprang ; but Patrick raised</l>
     <l n="136">His hand , and stone-like crouched they chained and still :</l>
     <l n="137">Then , Dichu onward striding fierce , the Saint</l>
     <l n="138">Between them signed the Cross ; and lo , the sword</l>
     <l n="139">Froze in his hand , and Dichu stood like stone .</l>
     <l n="140">The amazement past , he prayed the man of God</l>
     <l n="141">To grace his house ; and , side by side , a mile</l>
     <l n="142">They clomb the hills . Ascending , Patrick turned ,</l>
     <l n="143">His heart with prescience filled . Beneath , there lay</l>
     <l n="144">A gleaming strait ; beyond , a dim vast plain</l>
     <l n="145">With many an inlet pierced : a golden marge</l>
     <l n="146">Girdled the water-tongues with flag and reed ;</l>
     <l n="147">But , farther off , a gentle sea-mist changed</l>
     <l n="148">The fair green flats to purple . “ Night comes on ; ”</l>
     <l n="149">Thus Dichu spake , and waited . Patrick then</l>
     <l n="150">Advanced once more , and Sabhall soon was reached ,</l>
     <l n="151">A castle half , half barn . There garnered lay</l>
     <l n="152">Much grain , and sun-imbrowned : and Patrick said ,</l>
     <l n="153">“ Here where the earthly grain was stored for man</l>
     <l n="154">The bread of angels man shall eat one day . ”</l>
     <l n="155">And Patrick loved that place , and Patrick said ,</l>
     <l n="156">“ King Dichu , give thou to the poor that grain ,</l>
     <l n="157">To Christ , our Lord , thy barn . ” The strong man stood</l>
     <l n="158">In doubt ; but prayers of little orphaned babes</l>
     <l n="159">Reared by his hand , went up for him that hour :</l>
     <l n="160">Therefore that barn he ceded , and to Christ</l>
     <l n="161">By Patrick was baptised . Where lay the corn</l>
     <l n="162">A convent later rose . There dwelt he oft ;</l>
     <l n="163">And ‘ neath its roof more late the stranger sat ,</l>
     <l n="164">Exile , or kingdom-wearied king , or bard ,</l>
     <l n="165">That haply blind in age , yet tempest-rocked</l>
     <l n="166">By memories of departed glories , drew</l>
     <l n="167">With gradual influx into his old heart</l>

     <l n="172">Of Milcho . “ Once his thrall , against my will</l>

     <l n="192">Milcho will shrivel his small eye and say</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="301">Time passed .</l>
     <l n="302">One morn in bitter mockery Milcho mused :</l>
     <l n="303">“ What better laughter than when thief from thief</l>
     <l n="304">Pilfers the pilfered goods ? Our Druid thief</l>
     <l n="305">Two thousand years hath milked and shorn this land ;</l>
     <l n="306">Now comes the thief outlandish that with him</l>
     <l n="307">Would share milk-pail and fleece ! O Bacrach old ,</l>
     <l n="308">To hear thee shout ‘ Impostor ! ’ ” Straight he went</l>
     <l n="309">To Bacrach 's cell hid in a skirt wind-shav'n</l>
     <l n="310">Of low-grown wood , and met , departing thence ,</l>
     <l n="311">Three sailors sea-tanned from a ship late-beached .</l>
     <l n="312">Within a corner huddled , on the floor ,</l>
     <l n="313">The Druid sat , cowering , and cold , and mazed :</l>
     <l n="314">Sudden he rose , and cried , by conquering joy</l>
     <l n="315">Clothed as with youth restored : “ The God Unknown ,</l>
     <l n="316">That God who made the earth , hath walked the earth !</l>
     <l n="317">This hour His Prophet treads the isle ! Three men</l>
     <l n="318">Have seen him ; and their speech is true . To them</l>
     <l n="319">That Prophet spake : ‘ Four hundred years ago ,</l>
     <l n="320">Sinless God 's Son on earth for sinners died :</l>
     <l n="321">Black grew the world , and graves gave up their dead . ’</l>
     <l n="322">Thus spake the Seer . Four hundred years ago !</l>
     <l n="323">Mark well the time ! Of Ulster 's Druid race</l>
     <l n="324">What man but yearly , those four hundred years ,</l>
     <l n="325">Trembled that tale recounting which with this</l>
     <l n="326">Tallies as footprint with the foot of man ?</l>
     <l n="327">Four hundred years ago — that self-same day -</l>
     <l n="328">Connor , the son of Nessa , Ulster 's King ,</l>
     <l n="329">Sat throned , and judged his people . As he sat ,</l>
     <l n="330">Under clear skies , behold , o'er all the earth</l>
     <l n="331">Swept a great shadow from the windless east ;</l>
     <l n="332">And darkness hung upon the air three hours ;</l>
     <l n="333">Dead fell the birds , and beasts astonied fled .</l>
     <l n="334">Then to his Chief of Druids , Connor spake</l>
     <l n="335">Whispering ; and he , his oracles explored ,</l>
     <l n="336">Shivering made answer , ‘ From a land accursed ,</l>
     <l n="337">O King , that shadow sweeps ; therein , this hour ,</l>
     <l n="338">By sinful men sinless God 's Son is slain . ’</l>
     <l n="339">Then Ulster 's king , down-dashing sceptre and crown ,</l>
     <l n="340">Rose , clamouring , ‘ Sinless ! shall the sinless die ? ’</l>
     <l n="341">And madness fell on him ; and down that steep</l>
     <l n="342">He rushed whereon the Emanian Palace stood ,</l>
     <l n="343">And reached the grove , Lambraidhe , with two swords ,</l>
     <l n="344">The sword of battle , and the sword of state ,</l>
     <l n="345">And hewed and hewed , crying , ‘ Were I but there</l>
     <l n="346">Thus they should fall who slay that Sinless One ; ’</l>
     <l n="347">And in that madness died . Old Erin 's sons</l>
     <l n="348">Beheld this thing ; nor ever in the land</l>
     <l n="349">Hath ceased the rumour , nor the tear for him</l>
     <l n="350">Who , wroth at justice trampled , martyr died .</l>
     <l n="351">And now we know that not for any dream</l>
     <l n="352">He died , but for the truth : and whensoe'er</l>
     <l n="353">The Prophet of that Son of God who died</l>
     <l n="354">Sinless for sinners , standeth in this place ,</l>
     <l n="355">I , Bacrach , oldest Druid in this Isle ,</l>

     <l n="359">A later day</l>
     <l n="360">When the wild March sunset , gone almost ere come ,</l>
     <l n="361">By glacial shower was hustled out of life ,</l>
     <l n="362">Under a blighted ash tree , near his house ,</l>

     <l n="366">Yet disbelief not less might work our bane !</l>
     <l n="367">For , I remember , once a sickly slave</l>
     <l n="368">Ill shepherded my flock : I spake him plain ;</l>

     <l n="373">Two lambs lay dead . I hanged him on a tree .</l>
     <l n="374">What tree ? this tree ! Why , this is passing strange !</l>
     <l n="375">For , three nights since , I saw him in a dream :</l>
     <l n="376">Weakling as wont he stood beside my bed ,</l>
     <l n="377">And , clutching at his wrenched and livid throat ,</l>
     <l n="378">Spake thus , ‘ Belief is safest . ’ ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="379">Ceased the hail</l>
     <l n="380">To rattle on the ever barren boughs ,</l>
     <l n="381">And friendlier sound was heard . Beside his door</l>
     <l n="382">Wayworn the messengers of Patrick stood ,</l>
     <l n="383">And showed the gifts , and held his missive forth .</l>
     <l n="384">Then learned that lost one all the truth . That sage</l>
     <l n="385">Confessed by miracles , that prophet vouched</l>
     <l n="386">By warnings old , that seer by words of might</l>
     <l n="387">Subduing all things to himself — that priest ,</l>
     <l n="388">None other was than the uncomplaining boy</l>
     <l n="389">Five years his slave and swineherd ! In him rage</l>
     <l n="390">Burst forth , with fear commixed , as when a beast</l>
     <l n="391">Strains in the toils . “ Can I alone stand firm ? ”</l>
     <l n="392">He mused ; and next , “ Shall I , in mine old age ,</l>

     <l n="394">Shall I not rather drive him from my door</l>
     <l n="395">With wolf hounds and a curse ? ” As thus he stood</l>
     <l n="396">He marked the gifts , and bade men bare them in ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="398">But Milcho slept not all that night for thought ,</l>

     <l n="400">Stone-roughened like the graveyard of dead hosts ,</l>
     <l n="401">Till noontide . Sudden then he stopt , and thus</l>
     <l n="402">Discoursed within : “ A plot from first to last ,</l>
     <l n="403">The fraudulent bondage , flight , and late return ;</l>
     <l n="404">For now I mind me of a foolish dream</l>
     <l n="405">Chance-sent , yet drawn by him awry . One night</l>
     <l n="406">Methought that boy from far hills drenched in rain</l>
     <l n="407">Dashed through my halls , all fire . From hands and head ,</l>
     <l n="408">From hair and mouth , forth rushed a flaming fire</l>
     <l n="409">White , like white light , and still that mighty flame</l>
     <l n="410">Into itself took all . With hands outstretched</l>
     <l n="411">I spurned it . On my cradled daughters twain</l>
     <l n="412">It turned , and they were ashes . Then in burst</l>
     <l n="413">The south wind through the portals of the house ,</l>
     <l n="414">Tempest rose-sweet , and blew those ashes forth</l>
     <l n="415">Wide as the realm . At dawn I sought the knave ;</l>
     <l n="416">He glossed my vision thus : ‘ That fire is Faith -</l>
     <l n="417">Faith in the God Triune , the God made Man ,</l>

     <l n="422">Not less thy little daughters shall believe</l>
     <l n="423">With glory and great joy ; and , when they die ,</l>
     <l n="424">Report of them , like ashes blown abroad ,</l>

     <l n="429">Thus mused he , while black shadow swept the moor .</l>
     <l n="430">So day by day darker was Milcho 's heart ,</l>

     <l n="436">Near him had ever pined , like stunted growth</l>
     <l n="437">Dwarfed by some glacier nigh . The fifth day dawned :</l>
     <l n="438">And inly thus he muttered , darkly pale :</l>

     <l n="501">Then filled he his huge hall with resinous beams</l>

   <p>SAINT PATRICK AND THE CHILDREN OF FOCHLUT WOOD .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Saint Patrick makes way into Fochlut wood by the sea , the oldest of Erin 's forests , whence there had been borne unto him , then in a distant land , the Children 's Wail from Erin . He meets there two young Virgins , who sing a dirge of man 's sorrowful condition . Afterwards they lead him to the fortress of the king , their father . There are sung two songs , a song of Vengeance and a song of Lament ; which ended , Saint Patrick makes proclamation of the Advent and of the Resurrection . The king and all his chiefs believe with full contentment .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">One day as Patrick sat upon a stone</l>
     <l n="2">Judging his people , Pagan babes flocked round ,</l>
     <l n="3">All light and laughter , angel-like of mien ,</l>
     <l n="4">Sueing for bread . He gave it , and they ate :</l>
     <l n="5">Then said he , “ Kneel ; ” and taught them prayer : but lo !</l>
     <l n="6">Sudden the stag hounds ’ music dinned the wind ;</l>
     <l n="7">They heard ; they sprang ; they chased it . Patrick spake ;</l>
     <l n="8">“ It was the cry of children that I heard</l>
     <l n="9">Borne from the black wood o'er the midnight seas :</l>
     <l n="10">Where are those children ? What avails though Kings</l>
     <l n="11">Have bowed before my Gospel , and in awe</l>
     <l n="12">Nations knelt low , unless I set mine eyes</l>
     <l n="13">On Fochlut Wood ? ” Thus speaking , he arose ,</l>
     <l n="14">And , journeying with the brethren toward the West ,</l>
     <l n="15">Fronted the confine of that forest old .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="16">Then entered they that darkness ; and the wood</l>
     <l n="17">Closed as a cavern round them . O'er its roof</l>
     <l n="18">Leaned roof of cloud , and hissing ran the wind ,</l>
     <l n="19">And moaned the trunks for centuries hollowed out</l>
     <l n="20">Yet stalwart still . There , rooted in the rock ,</l>
     <l n="21">Stood the huge growths , by us unnamed , that frowned</l>
     <l n="22">Perhaps on Partholan , the parricide ,</l>
     <l n="23">When that first Pagan settler fugitive</l>
     <l n="24">Landed , a man foredoomed . Between the stems</l>
     <l n="25">The ravening beast now glared , now fled . Red leaves ,</l>
     <l n="26">The last year 's phantoms , rattled here and there .</l>
     <l n="27">The oldest wood that ever grew in Eire</l>
     <l n="28">Was Fochlut Wood , and gloomiest . Spirits of Ill</l>
     <l n="29">Made it their palace , and its labyrinths sowed</l>
     <l n="30">With poisons . Many a cave , with horrors thronged</l>
     <l n="31">Within it yawned , and many a chasm unseen</l>
     <l n="32">Waited the unwary treader . Cry of wolf</l>
     <l n="33">Pierced the cold air , and gibbering ghosts were heard ;</l>
     <l n="34">And o'er the black marsh passed those wandering lights</l>
     <l n="35">That lure lost feet . A thousand pathways wound</l>
     <l n="36">From gloom to gloom . One only led to light :</l>
     <l n="37">That path was sharp with flints .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="38">Then Patrick mused ,</l>
     <l n="39">“ O life of man , how dark a wood art thou !</l>
     <l n="40">Erring how many track thee till Despair ,</l>
     <l n="41">Sad host , receives them in his crypt-like porch</l>
     <l n="42">At nightfall . ” Mute he paced . The brethren feared ;</l>
     <l n="43">And fearing , knelt to God . Made strong by prayer</l>
     <l n="44">Westward once more they trod that dark , sharp way</l>
     <l n="45">Till deeper gloom announced the night , then slept</l>
     <l n="46">Guarded by angels . But the Saint all night</l>
     <l n="47">Watched , strong in prayer . The second day still on</l>
     <l n="48">They fared , like mariners o'er strange seas borne ,</l>
     <l n="49">That keep in mist their soundings when the rocks</l>
     <l n="50">Vex the dark strait , and breakers roar unseen .</l>
     <l n="51">At last Benignus cried , “ To God be praise !</l>
     <l n="52">He sends us better omens . See ! the moss</l>
     <l n="53">Brightens the crag ! ” Ere long another spake :</l>
     <l n="54">“ The worst is past ! This freshness in the air</l>
     <l n="55">Wafts us a welcome from the great salt sea ;</l>
     <l n="56">Fair spreads the fern : green buds are on the spray ,</l>
     <l n="57">And violets throng the grass . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="58">A few steps more</l>
     <l n="59">Brought them to where , with peaceful gleam , there spread</l>
     <l n="60">A forest pool that mirrored yew trees twain</l>
     <l n="61">With beads like blood-drops hung . A sunset flash</l>
     <l n="62">Kindled a glory in the osiers brown</l>
     <l n="63">Encircling that still water . From the reeds</l>
     <l n="64">A sable bird , gold-circled , slowly rose ;</l>
     <l n="65">But when the towering tree-tops he outsoared ,</l>
     <l n="66">Eastward a great wind swept him as a leaf .</l>
     <l n="67">Serenely as he rose a music soft</l>
     <l n="68">Swelled from afar ; but , as that storm o'ertook him ,</l>
     <l n="69">The music changed to one on-rushing note</l>
     <l n="70">O'ertaken by a second ; both , ere long ,</l>
     <l n="71">Blended in wail unending . Patrick 's brow ,</l>
     <l n="72">Listening that wail , was altered , and he spake :</l>
     <l n="73">“ These were the Voices that I heard when stood</l>
     <l n="74">By night beside me in that southern land</l>
     <l n="75">God 's angel , girt for speed . Letters he bare</l>
     <l n="76">Unnumbered , full of woes . He gave me one ,</l>
     <l n="77">Inscribed , ‘ The Wailing of the Irish Race ; ’</l>
     <l n="78">And as I read that legend on mine ear</l>
     <l n="79">Forth from a mighty wood on Erin 's coast</l>
     <l n="80">There rang the cry of children , ‘ Walk once more</l>
     <l n="81">Among us ; bring us help ! ’ ” Thus Patrick spake :</l>
     <l n="82">Then towards that wailing paced with forward head .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="83">Ere long they came to where a river broad ,</l>
     <l n="84">Swiftly amid the dense trees winding , brimmed</l>
     <l n="85">The flower-enamelled marge , and onward bore</l>
     <l n="86">Green branches ‘ mid its eddies . On the bank</l>
     <l n="87">Two virgins stood . Whiter than earliest streak</l>
     <l n="88">Of matin pearl dividing dusky clouds</l>
     <l n="89">Their raiment ; and , as oft in silent woods</l>
     <l n="90">White beds of wind-flower lean along the earth-breeze ,</l>
     <l n="91">So on the river-breeze that raiment wan</l>
     <l n="92">Shivered , back blown . Slender they stood and tall ,</l>
     <l n="93">Their brows with violets bound ; while shone , beneath ,</l>
     <l n="94">The dark blue of their never-tearless eyes .</l>
     <l n="95">Then Patrick , “ For the sake of Him who lays</l>
     <l n="96">His blessing on the mourners , O ye maids ,</l>
     <l n="97">Reveal to me your grief — if yours late sent ,</l>
     <l n="98">Or sped in careless childhood . ” And the maids :</l>
     <l n="99">“ Happy whose careless childhood ‘ scaped the wound : ”</l>
     <l n="100">Then she that seemed the saddest added thus :</l>
     <l n="101">“ Stranger ! this forest is no roof of joy ,</l>
     <l n="102">Nor we the only mourners ; neither fall</l>
     <l n="103">Bitterer the widow 's nor the orphan 's tears</l>
     <l n="104">Now than of old ; nor sharper than long since</l>
     <l n="105">That loss which maketh maiden widowhood .</l>
     <l n="106">In childhood first our sorrow came . One eve</l>
     <l n="107">Within our foster-parents ’ low-roofed house</l>
     <l n="108">The winter sunset from our bed had waned :</l>
     <l n="109">I slept , and sleeping dreamed . Beside the bed</l>
     <l n="110">There stood a lovely Lady crowned with stars ;</l>
     <l n="111">A sword went through her heart . Down from that sword</l>
     <l n="112">Blood trickled on the bed , and on the ground .</l>
     <l n="113">Sorely I wept . The Lady spake : ‘ My child ,</l>
     <l n="114">Weep not for me , but for thy country weep ;</l>
     <l n="115">Her wound is deeper far than mine . Cry loud !</l>
     <l n="116">The cry of grief is Prayer . ’ I woke , all tears ;</l>
     <l n="117">And lo ! my little sister , stiff and cold ,</l>
     <l n="118">Sat with wide eyes upon the bed upright :</l>
     <l n="119">That starry Lady with the bleeding heart</l>
     <l n="120">She , too , had seen , and heard her . Clamour vast</l>
     <l n="121">Rang out ; and all the wall was fiery red ;</l>
     <l n="122">And flame was on the sea . A hostile clan</l>
     <l n="123">Landing in mist , had fired our ships and town ,</l>
     <l n="124">Our clansmen absent on a foray far ,</l>
     <l n="125">And stricken many an old man , many a boy</l>
     <l n="126">To bondage dragged . Oh night with blood redeemed !</l>
     <l n="127">Upon the third day o'er the green waves rushed</l>
     <l n="128">The vengeance winged , with axe and torch , to quit</l>
     <l n="129">Wrong with new wrong , and many a time since then .</l>
     <l n="130">That night sad women on the sea sands toiled ,</l>
     <l n="131">Drawing from wreck and ruin , beam or plank</l>
     <l n="132">To shield their babes . Our foster-parents slain ,</l>
     <l n="133">Unheeded we , the children of the chief ,</l>
     <l n="134">Roamed the great forest . There we told our dream</l>
     <l n="135">To children likewise orphaned . Sudden fear</l>
     <l n="136">Smote them as though themselves had dreamed that dream ,</l>
     <l n="137">And back from them redoubled upon us ;</l>
     <l n="138">Until at last from us and them rang out -</l>
     <l n="139">The dark wood heard it , and the midnight sea -</l>
     <l n="140">A great and bitter cry . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="141">“ That cry went up ,</l>
     <l n="142">O children , to the heart of God ; and He</l>
     <l n="143">Down sent it , pitying , to a far-off land ,</l>
     <l n="144">And on into my heart . By that first pang</l>
     <l n="145">Which left the eternal pallor in your cheeks ,</l>
     <l n="146">O maids , I pray you , sing once more that song</l>
     <l n="147">Ye sang but late . I heard its long last note :</l>
     <l n="148">Fain would I hear the song that such death died . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="149">They sang : not scathless those that sing such song !</l>

     <l n="151">To hearts by grief unvanquished , to their hearts</l>
     <l n="152">Had taught a melody that neither spared</l>
     <l n="153">Singer nor listener . Pale when they began ,</l>
     <l n="154">Paler it left them . He not less was pale</l>
     <l n="155">Who , out of trance awaking , thanked them thus :</l>
     <l n="156">“ Now know I of that sorrow in you fixed ;</l>

     <l n="166">One wildered sheep , the meanest of the flock ,</l>
     <l n="167">And on His shoulders bore it to that House</l>
     <l n="168">Where dwelt His Sire . ‘ Good Shepherd ’ was His Name .</l>
     <l n="169">My tidings these : heralds are we , footsore ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="171">On they paced ,</l>

     <l n="173">Beside the elder sister Patrick walked ,</l>
     <l n="174">Benignus by the younger . Fair her face ;</l>
     <l n="175">Majestic his , though young . Her looks were sad</l>
     <l n="176">And awe-struck ; his , fulfilled with secret joy ,</l>
     <l n="177">Sent forth a gleam as when a morn-touched bay</l>
     <l n="178">Through ambush shines of woodlands . Soon they stood</l>
     <l n="179">Where sea and river met , and trod a path</l>
     <l n="180">Wet with salt spray , and drank the clement breeze ,</l>
     <l n="181">And saw the quivering of the green gold wave ,</l>
     <l n="182">And , far beyond , that fierce aggressor 's bourn ,</l>
     <l n="183">Fair haunt for savage race , a purple ridge</l>
     <l n="184">By rainy sunbeam gemmed from glen to glen ,</l>
     <l n="185">Dim waste of wandering lights . The sun , half risen ,</l>
     <l n="186">Lay half sea-couched . A neighbouring height sent forth</l>
     <l n="187">Welcome of baying hounds ; and , close at hand ,</l>
     <l n="188">They reached the chieftain 's keep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="189">A white-haired man</l>
     <l n="190">And long since blind , there sat he in his hall ,</l>
     <l n="191">Untamed by age . At times a fiery gleam</l>
     <l n="192">Flashed from his sightless eyes ; and oft the red</l>
     <l n="193">Burned on his forehead , while with splenetic speech</l>
     <l n="194">Stirred by ill news or memory stung , he banned</l>
     <l n="195">Foes and false friend . Pleased by his daughters ’ tale ,</l>

     <l n="202">Its seat had half relinquished on a cheek</l>
     <l n="203">Long time its boast , and on that willowy form ,</l>
     <l n="204">So yielding now , where once in strength upsoared</l>

    <head>SAINT PATRICK AND THE IMPOSTOR ;</head>
    <head>OR , MAC KYLE OF MAN .</head>
    <head>Mac Kyle , a child of death , dwells in a forest with other men like unto himself , that slay whom they will . Saint Patrick coming to that wood , a certain Impostor devises how he may be deceived and killed ; but God smites the Impostor through his own snare , and he dies . Mac Kyle believes , and demanding penance is baptised . Afterwards he preaches in Manann { 77 } Isle , and becomes a great Saint .</head>

     <l n="4">Had rushed as stormy morn to stormier noon ,</l>
     <l n="5">Working , except that still he spared the poor ,</l>
     <l n="6">All wrongs with iron will ; a child of death .</l>
     <l n="7">Thus spake he to his followers , while the woods</l>
     <l n="8">Snow-cumbered creaked , their scales of icy mail</l>
     <l n="9">Angered by winter winds : “ At last he comes ,</l>
     <l n="10">He that deceives the people with great signs ,</l>
     <l n="11">And for the tinkling of a little gold</l>
     <l n="12">Preaches new Gods . Where rises yonder smoke</l>
     <l n="13">Beyond the pinewood , camps this Lord of Dupes :</l>
     <l n="14">How say ye ? Shall he track o'er Uladh 's plains ,</l>
     <l n="15">As o'er the land beside , his venomous way ?</l>

     <l n="38">But like the race of mortals . Sweep the cloth</l>

     <l n="40">Thus counselled Garban ; and the counsel pleased ;</l>

     <l n="46">Smiled as he heard it — “ Lo , our friend is dead !</l>

     <l n="56">Amazement fell upon that bandit throng ,</l>

     <l n="58">Grief for his friend , remorse , and strong belief ,</l>
     <l n="59">A threefold power : for she that at his birth ,</l>
     <l n="60">Her brief life faithful to that Law she knew ,</l>
     <l n="61">Had died , in region where desires are crowned</l>
     <l n="62">That hour was strong in prayer . “ From God he came , ”</l>
     <l n="63">Thus cried they ; “ and we worked a work accursed ,</l>
     <l n="64">Tempting God 's prophet . ” Patrick heard , and spake ;</l>
     <l n="65">“ Not me ye tempted , but the God I serve . ”</l>
     <l n="66">At last Mac Kyle made answer : “ I have sinned ;</l>
     <l n="67">I , and this people , whom I made to sin :</l>
     <l n="68">Now therefore to thy God we yield ourselves</l>
     <l n="69">Liegemen henceforth , his thralls as slave to Lord ,</l>
     <l n="70">Or horse to master . That which thou command'st</l>
     <l n="71">That will we do . ” And Patrick said , “ Believe ;</l>
     <l n="72">Confess your sins ; and be baptised to God ,</l>
     <l n="73">The Father , and the Son , and Holy Spirit ,</l>
     <l n="74">And live true life . ” Then Patrick where he stood</l>
     <l n="75">Above the dead , with hands uplifted preached</l>
     <l n="76">To these in anguish and in terror bowed</l>
     <l n="77">The tidings of great joy from Bethlehem 's Crib</l>
     <l n="78">To Calvary 's Cross . Sudden upon his knees ,</l>
     <l n="79">Heart-pierced , as though he saw that Head thorn-pierced ,</l>
     <l n="80">Fell that wild chief , and was baptised to God ;</l>

     <l n="82">The waters streamed adown his matted locks ,</l>
     <l n="83">He cried , “ Alas , my master , and my sire !</l>
     <l n="84">I sinned a mighty sin ; for in my heart</l>
     <l n="85">Fixed was my purpose , soon as thou hadst knelt ,</l>

     <l n="87">What ERIC I must pay to quit my sin ? ”</l>
     <l n="88">Him Patrick answered , “ God shall be thy Judge :</l>
     <l n="89">Arise , and to the seaside flee , as one</l>
     <l n="90">That flies his foe . There shalt thou find a boat</l>

     <l n="99">Working the Will Divine . ” Then spake that chief ,</l>
     <l n="100">“ I , that commanded others , can obey ;</l>
     <l n="101">Such lore alone is mine : but for this man</l>
     <l n="102">That sinned my sin , alas , to see him thus ! ”</l>
     <l n="103">To whom the Saint , “ For him , when thou art gone ,</l>
     <l n="104">My prayer shall rise . If God will raise the dead</l>

     <l n="109">But loosed a little boat , of one hide made ,</l>
     <l n="110">And sat therein , and round his ankles wound</l>
     <l n="111">The boat chain thrice ; and flung the key far forth</l>
     <l n="112">Above the ridged sea foam . The Lord of all</l>
     <l n="113">Gave ordinance to the wind , and , as a leaf</l>
     <l n="114">Swift rushed that boat , oarless and rudderless ,</l>
     <l n="115">Over the on-shouldering , broad-backed , glaucous wave</l>
     <l n="116">Slow-rising like the rising of a world ,</l>
     <l n="117">And purple wastes beyond , with funeral plume</l>
     <l n="118">Crested , a pallid pomp . All night the chief</l>
     <l n="119">Under the roaring tempest heard the voice</l>
     <l n="120">That preached the Son of Man ; and when the morn</l>
     <l n="121">Shone out , his coracle drew near the surge</l>
     <l n="122">Reboant on Manann 's Isle . Not unbeheld</l>
     <l n="123">Rose it , and fell ; not unregarded danced</l>
     <l n="124">A black spot on the inrolling ridge , then hung</l>
     <l n="125">Suspense upon the mile-long cataract</l>
     <l n="126">That , overtoppling , changed grass-green to light ,</l>
     <l n="127">And drowned the shores in foam . Upon the sands</l>
     <l n="128">Two white-haired Elders in the salt air knelt ,</l>
     <l n="129">Offering to God their early orisons ,</l>
     <l n="130">Coninri and Romael . Sixty years</l>
     <l n="131">These two unto a hard and stubborn race</l>
     <l n="132">Had preached the Word ; and gaining by their toil</l>
     <l n="133">But thirty souls , had daily prayed their God</l>
     <l n="134">To send ere yet they died some ampler arm ,</l>
     <l n="135">And reap the ill-grown harvest of their youth .</l>
     <l n="136">Ten years they prayed , not doubting , and from God ,</l>
     <l n="137">Who hastens not , this answer had received ,</l>
     <l n="138">“ Ye shall not die until ye see his face . ”</l>
     <l n="139">Therefore , each morning , peered they o'er the waves ,</l>
     <l n="140">Long-watching . These through breakers dragged the man ,</l>
     <l n="141">Their wished-for prize , half-frozen , and nigh to death ,</l>
     <l n="142">And bare him to their cell , and warmed and fed him ,</l>

     <l n="148">Then passed into his spirit the Spirit of Love ;</l>

    <head>Saint Patrick goes to Cashel of the Rings to celebrate the Feast of the Annunciation . Aengus , who reigns there , receives him with all honour . He and his people believe , and by Baptism are added unto the Church . Aengus desires to resign his sovereignty , and become a monk . The Saint suffers not this , because he had discovered by two notable signs , both at the baptism of Aengus and before it , that the Prince is of those who are called by God to rule men .</head>

     <l n="11">At Cashel of the Kings . The royal keep</l>
     <l n="12">High-seated on its Rock , as morning broke</l>
     <l n="13">Faced them at last ; and at the selfsame hour</l>
     <l n="14">Aengus , in his father 's absence lord ,</l>
     <l n="15">Rising from happy sleep and heaven-sent dreams</l>
     <l n="16">Went forth on duteous tasks . With sudden start</l>
     <l n="17">The prince stept back ; for , o'er the fortress court</l>
     <l n="18">Like grove storm-levelled lay the idols huge ,</l>
     <l n="19">False gods and foul that long had awed the land ,</l>
     <l n="20">Prone , without hand of man . O'erhYpppHeNawed he gazed ;</l>
     <l n="21">Then on the air there rang a sound of hymns ,</l>
     <l n="22">And by the eastern gate Saint Patrick stood ,</l>
     <l n="23">The brethren round him . On their shaggy garb</l>
     <l n="24">Auroral mist , struck by the rising sun ,</l>
     <l n="25">Glittered , that diamond-panoplied they seemed ,</l>
     <l n="26">And as a heavenly vision . At that sight</l>
     <l n="27">The youth , descending with a wildered joy ,</l>
     <l n="28">Welcomed his guests : and , ere an hour , the streets</l>
     <l n="29">Sparkled far down like flowering meads in spring ,</l>
     <l n="30">So thronged the folk in holiday attire</l>
     <l n="31">To see the man far-famed . “ Who spurns our gods ? ”</l>
     <l n="32">Once they had cried in wrath : but , year by year ,</l>
     <l n="33">Tidings of some deliverance great and strange ,</l>
     <l n="34">Some life more noble , some sublimer hope ,</l>
     <l n="35">Some regal race enthroned beyond the grave ,</l>
     <l n="36">Had reached them from afar . The best believed ,</l>
     <l n="37">Great hearts for whom nor earthly love sufficed</l>
     <l n="38">Nor earthly fame . The meaner scoffed : yet all</l>
     <l n="39">Desired the man . Delay had edged their thirst .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="40">Then Patrick , standing up among them , spake ,</l>
     <l n="41">And God was with him . Not as when loose tongue</l>
     <l n="42">Babbles vain rumour , or the Sophist spins</l>
     <l n="43">Thought 's air-hung cobwebs gay with Fancy 's dews ,</l>
     <l n="44">Spake he , but words of might , as when a man</l>
     <l n="45">Bears witness to the things which he has seen ,</l>
     <l n="46">And tells of that he knows : and as the harp</l>
     <l n="47">Attested is by rapture of the ear ,</l>
     <l n="48">And sunlight by consenting of the eye</l>
     <l n="49">That , seeing , knows it sees , and neither craves</l>
     <l n="50">Inferior demonstration , so his words</l>
     <l n="51">Self-proved , went forth and conquered : for man 's mind ,</l>
     <l n="52">Created in His image who is Truth ,</l>
     <l n="53">Challenged by truth , with recognising voice</l>
     <l n="54">Cries out “ Flesh of my flesh , bone of my bone , ”</l>
     <l n="55">And cleaves thereto . In all that listening host</l>
     <l n="56">One vast , dilating heart yearned to its God .</l>
     <l n="57">Then burst the bond of years . No haunting doubt</l>
     <l n="58">They knew . God dropped on them the robe of Truth</l>
     <l n="59">Sun-like : down fell the many-coloured weed</l>
     <l n="60">Of error ; and , reclothed ere yet unclothed ,</l>
     <l n="61">They walked a new-born earth . The blinded Past</l>
     <l n="62">Fled , vanquished . Glorious more than strange it seemed</l>
     <l n="63">That He who fashioned man should come to man ,</l>
     <l n="64">And raise by ruling . They , His trumpet heard ,</l>
     <l n="65">In glory spurned demons misdeemed for gods :</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="68">Then rose the cry ,</l>

     <l n="71">Ye that would fain be house-mates with my King ?</l>
     <l n="72">Ye seek His cross ! ” He paused , then added slow :</l>

   <p>SAINT PATRICK AND THE CHILDLESS MOTHER .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Saint Patrick finds an aged Pagan woman making great lamentation above a tomb which she believes to be that of her son . He kneels beside her in prayer , while around them a wondrous tempest sweeps . After a long time , he declares unto her the Death of Christ , and how , through that Death , the Dead are blessed . Lastly , he dissuades her from her rage of grief , and admonishes her to pray for her son on a tomb hard by , which is his indeed . The woman believes , and , being consoled by a Sign of Heaven , departs in peace .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Across his breast one hundred times each day</l>
     <l n="2">Saint Patrick drew the Venerable Sign ,</l>
     <l n="3">And sixty times by night : and whensoe'er</l>
     <l n="4">In travel Cross was seen far off or nigh</l>
     <l n="5">On lonely moor , or rock , or heathy hill ,</l>
     <l n="6">For Erin then was sown with Christian seed ,</l>
     <l n="7">He sought it , and before it knelt . Yet once ,</l>
     <l n="8">While cold in winter shone the star of eve</l>
     <l n="9">Upon their board , thus spake a youthful monk :</l>
     <l n="10">“ Three times this day , my father , didst thou pass</l>
     <l n="11">The Cross of Christ unmarked . At morn thou saw'st</l>
     <l n="12">A last year 's lamb that by it sheltered lay ,</l>
     <l n="13">At noon a dove that near it sat and mourned ,</l>
     <l n="14">At eve a little child that round it raced ,</l>
     <l n="15">Well pleased with each ; yet saw'st thou not that Cross ,</l>
     <l n="16">Nor mad'st thou any reverence ! ” At that word</l>
     <l n="17">Wondering , the Saint arose , and left the meat ,</l>
     <l n="18">And , wondering , went to venerate that Cross .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="19">Dark was the earth and dank ere yet he reached</l>
     <l n="20">That spot ; and lo ! where lamb had lain , and dove</l>
     <l n="21">Had mourned , and child had raced , there stood indeed</l>
     <l n="22">High-raised , the Cross of Christ . Before it long</l>
     <l n="23">He prayed , and kneeling , marked that on a tomb</l>
     <l n="24">That Cross was raised . Then , inly moved by God ,</l>
     <l n="25">The Saint demanded , “ Who , of them that walked</l>
     <l n="26">The sun-warmed earth lies here in darkness hid ? ”</l>
     <l n="27">And answer made a lamentable Voice :</l>
     <l n="28">“ Pagan I lived , my own soul 's bane : — when dead ,</l>
     <l n="29">Men buried here my body . ” Patrick then :</l>
     <l n="30">“ How stands the Cross of Christ on Pagan grave ? ”</l>
     <l n="31">And answered thus the lamentable Voice :</l>
     <l n="32">“ A woman 's work . She had been absent long ;</l>
     <l n="33">Her son had died ; near mine his grave was made ;</l>
     <l n="34">Half blind was she through fleeting of her tears ,</l>
     <l n="35">And , erring , raised the Cross upon my tomb ,</l>
     <l n="36">Misdeeming it for his . Nightly she comes ,</l>
     <l n="37">Wailing as only Pagan mothers wail ;</l>
     <l n="38">So wailed my mother once , while pain tenfold</l>
     <l n="39">Ran through my bodiless being . For her sake ,</l>
     <l n="40">If pity dwells on earth or highest heaven ,</l>
     <l n="41">May it this mourner comfort ! Christian she ,</l>
     <l n="42">And capable of pity . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="43">Then the Saint</l>
     <l n="44">Cried loud , “ O God , Thou seest this Pagan 's heart ,</l>
     <l n="45">That love within it dwells : therefore not his</l>
     <l n="46">That doom of Souls all hate , and self-exiled</l>
     <l n="47">To whom Thy Presence were a woe twice told .</l>
     <l n="48">Eternal Pity ! pity Thou Thy work ; -</l>
     <l n="49">Sole Peace of them that love Thee , grant him peace . ”</l>
     <l n="50">Thus Patrick prayed ; and in the heaven of heavens</l>
     <l n="51">God heard his servant 's prayer . Then Patrick mused</l>
     <l n="52">“ Now know I why I passed that Cross unmarked ;</l>
     <l n="53">It was not that it seemed . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="54">As thus he knelt ,</l>
     <l n="55">Behold , upon the cold and bitter wind</l>
     <l n="56">Rang wail on wail ; and o'er the moor there moved</l>
     <l n="57">What seemed a woman 's if a human form .</l>
     <l n="58">That miserable phantom onward came</l>
     <l n="59">With cry succeeding cry that sank or swelled</l>
     <l n="60">As dipped or rose the moor . Arrived at last ,</l>
     <l n="61">She heeded not the Saint , but on that grave</l>
     <l n="62">Dashed herself down . Long time that woman wailed ;</l>
     <l n="63">And Patrick , long , for reverence of her woe</l>
     <l n="64">Forbore . At last he spake low-toned as when</l>
     <l n="65">Best listener knows not when the strain begins .</l>
     <l n="66">“ Daughter ! the sparrow falls not to the ground</l>
     <l n="67">Without his Maker . He that made thy son</l>
     <l n="68">Hath sent His Son to bear all woes of men ,</l>
     <l n="69">And vanquish every foe — the latest , Death . ”</l>
     <l n="70">Then rolled that woman on the Saint an eye</l>
     <l n="71">As when the last survivor of a host</l>

     <l n="73">That treads upon my grief ! He ne'er had sons ;</l>
     <l n="74">And thou , O son of mine , hast left no sons ,</l>
     <l n="75">Though oft I said , ‘ When I am old , his babes</l>
     <l n="76">Shall climb my knees . ’ My boast was mine in youth ;</l>
     <l n="77">But now mine age is made a barren stock</l>
     <l n="78">And as a blighted briar . ” In grief she turned ;</l>
     <l n="79">And as on blackening tarn gust follows gust ,</l>
     <l n="80">Again came wail on wail . On strode the night :</l>
     <l n="81">The jagged forehead of that forest old</l>
     <l n="82">Alone was seen : all else was gloom . At last</l>
     <l n="83">With voice , though kind , upbraiding , Patrick spake :</l>
     <l n="84">“ Daughter , thy grief is wilful and it errs ;</l>
     <l n="85">Errs like those sad and tear-bewildered eyes</l>
     <l n="86">That for a Christian 's take a Pagan 's grave ,</l>
     <l n="87">And for a son 's a stranger 's . Ah ! poor child ,</l>
     <l n="88">Thy pride it was to raise , where lay thy son ,</l>
     <l n="89">A Cross , his memory 's honour . By thee close</l>
     <l n="90">All dewed and glimmering in yon rising moon ,</l>
     <l n="91">Low lies a grave unhonoured , and unknown :</l>
     <l n="92">No cross stands on it ; yet upon its breast</l>
     <l n="93">Graved shalt thou find what Christian tomb ne'er lacks ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="95">She rose ; she found that other tomb ; she knelt ;</l>
     <l n="96">And o'er it went her wandering palms , as though</l>
     <l n="97">Some stone-blind mother o'er an infant 's face</l>
     <l n="98">Should spread an agonising hand , intent</l>
     <l n="99">To choose betwixt her own and counterfeit ;</l>
     <l n="100">She found that cross deep-grav'n , and further sign</l>
     <l n="101">Close by , to her well known . One piercing shriek -</l>
     <l n="102">Another moment , and her body lay</l>
     <l n="103">Along that grave with kisses , and wild hands</l>
     <l n="104">As when some forest beast tears up the ground ,</l>
     <l n="105">Seeking its prey there hidden . Then once more</l>
     <l n="106">Rang the wild wail above that lonely heath ,</l>
     <l n="107">While roared far off the vast invisible woods ,</l>
     <l n="108">And with them strove the blast , in eddies dire</l>
     <l n="109">Whirling both branch and bough . Through hurrying clouds</l>
     <l n="110">The scared moon rushed like ship that naked glares</l>
     <l n="111">One moment , lightning-lighted in the storm ,</l>
     <l n="112">Anon in wild waves drowned . An hour went by :</l>
     <l n="113">Still wailed that woman , and the tempest roared ;</l>
     <l n="114">While in the heart of ruin Patrick prayed .</l>
     <l n="115">He loved that woman . Unto Patrick dear ,</l>
     <l n="116">Dear as God 's Church was still the single Soul ,</l>
     <l n="117">Dearest the suffering Soul . He gave her time ;</l>
     <l n="118">He let the floods of anguish spend themselves :</l>
     <l n="119">But when her wail sank low ; when woods were mute ,</l>
     <l n="120">And where the skiey madness late had raged</l>
     <l n="121">Shone the blue heaven , he spake with voice in strength</l>
     <l n="122">Gentle like that which calmed the Syrian lake ,</l>
     <l n="123">“ My sister , God hath shown me of thy wound ,</l>
     <l n="124">And wherefore with the blind old Pagan 's cry</l>
     <l n="125">Hopeless thou mourn'st . Returned from far , thou found'st</l>
     <l n="126">Thy son had Christian died , and saw'st the Cross</l>
     <l n="127">On Christian graves : and ill thy heart endured</l>
     <l n="128">That tomb so dear should lack its reverence meet .</l>

     <l n="133">“ Of this new Faith I little understand ,</l>
     <l n="134">Being an aged woman and in woe :</l>
     <l n="135">But since my son was Christian , such am I ;</l>
     <l n="136">And since the Christian tomb is decked with Cross</l>

     <l n="1">Saint Patrick , being bidden to a feast , discourses</l>
     <l n="2">on the way against the pride of the Bards , for whom</l>
     <l n="3">Fiacc pleads . Derball , a scoffer , requires the Saint</l>

     <l n="6">Notwithstanding , Derball believes not , but departs .</l>
     <l n="7">The Saint declares that he saw not whether the</l>

     <l n="14">Of Patrick 's words and works . Before his foot</l>
     <l n="15">Aileel had fallen , loud wailing , with his wife ,</l>
     <l n="16">And cried , “ Our child is slain by savage beasts ;</l>
     <l n="17">But thou , O prophet , if that God thou serv'st</l>

     <l n="20">And raise yon child . ” But Malach answered , “ Nay ,</l>

     <l n="22">Then Patrick , “ Answer of the base is thine ;</l>

     <l n="27">To Ibar , and to Ailbe , bishops twain ,</l>
     <l n="28">And bade them raise the child . They heard and knelt :</l>
     <l n="29">And Patrick knelt between them ; and these three</l>

     <l n="332">That still sustains his name , and saw the flood</l>

    <head>SAINT PATRICK AND KING EOCHAID .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>King Eochaid submits himself to the Christian Law because Saint Patrick has delivered his son from bonds , yet only after making a pact that he is not , like the meaner sort , to be baptized . In this stubbornness he persists , though otherwise a kindly king ; and after many years , he dies . Saint Patrick had refused to see his living face ; yet after death he prays by the death-bed . Life returns to the dead ; and sitting up , like one sore amazed , he demands baptism . The Saint baptizes him , and offers him a choice either to reign over all Erin for fifteen years , or to die . Eochaid chooses to die , and so departs .</head>

     <l n="11">The yearning earth that , if it could , like waves</l>

     <l n="18">Eochaid ; but not his the pensive grief :</l>
     <l n="19">He would have kept his daughter in his house</l>

     <l n="21">Himself he chose her out a mate , and frowned ,</l>
     <l n="22">And said , “ The dog must have her . ” But the maid</l>
     <l n="23">Wished not for marriage . Tender was her heart ;</l>
     <l n="24">Yet though her twentieth year had o'er her flown ,</l>
     <l n="25">And though her tears had dewed a mother 's grave ,</l>
     <l n="26">In her there lurked , not flower of womanhood ,</l>
     <l n="27">But flower of angel texture . All around</l>
     <l n="28">To her was love . The crown of earthly love</l>
     <l n="29">Seemed but its crown of mockery . Love Divine -</l>
     <l n="30">For that she yearned , and yet she knew it not ;</l>
     <l n="31">Knew less that love she feared .</l>

     <l n="32">She walked in woods</l>

     <l n="34">Upon a shower-bespangled sycamore</l>
     <l n="35">Shivered , and birds among them choir on choir</l>
     <l n="36">Chanted her praise — or spring 's . “ Ill sung , ” she laughed ,</l>
     <l n="37">“ My dainty minstrels ! Grant to me your wings ,</l>
     <l n="38">And I for them will teach you song of mine :</l>
     <l n="39">Listen ! ” A carol from her lip there gushed</l>
     <l n="40">That , ere its time , might well have called the spring</l>
     <l n="41">From winter 's coldest cave . It ceased ; she turned .</l>
     <l n="42">Beside her Patrick stood . His hand he raised</l>
     <l n="43">To bless her . Awed , though glad , upon her knees</l>
     <l n="44">The maiden sank . His eye , as if through air ,</l>
     <l n="45">Saw through that stainless soul , and , crystal-shrined</l>
     <l n="46">Therein , its inmate , Truth . That other Truth</l>
     <l n="47">Instant to her he preached — the Truth Divine —</l>
     <l n="48">( For whence is caution needful , save from sin ? )</l>
     <l n="49">And those two Truths , each gazing upon each ,</l>
     <l n="50">Embraced like sisters , thenceforth one . For her</l>
     <l n="51">No arduous thing was Faith , ere yet she heard</l>
     <l n="52">In heart believing : and , as when a babe</l>
     <l n="53">Marks some bright shape , if near or far , it knows not ,</l>
     <l n="54">And stretches forth a witless hand to clasp</l>
     <l n="55">Phantom or form , even so with wild surmise</l>
     <l n="56">And guesses erring first , and questions apt ,</l>
     <l n="57">She chased the flying light , and round it closed</l>
     <l n="58">At last , and found it substance . “ This is He . ”</l>
     <l n="59">Then cried she , “ This , whom every maid should love ,</l>
     <l n="60">Conqueror self-sacrificed of sin and death :</l>
     <l n="61">How shall we find , how please Him , how be nigh ? ”</l>
     <l n="62">Patrick made answer : “ They that do His will</l>
     <l n="63">Are nigh Him . ” And the virgin : “ Of the nigh ,</l>
     <l n="64">Say , who is nighest ? ” Thus , that winged heart</l>
     <l n="65">Rushed to its rest . He answered : “ Nighest they</l>
     <l n="66">Who offer most to Him in sacrifice ,</l>
     <l n="67">As when the wedded leaves her father 's house</l>
     <l n="68">And cleaveth to her husband . Nighest they</l>
     <l n="69">Who neither father 's house nor husband 's house</l>
     <l n="70">Desire , but live with Him in endless prayer ,</l>
     <l n="71">And tend Him in His poor . ” Aloud she cried ,</l>
     <l n="72">“ The nearest to the Highest , that is love ; -</l>
     <l n="73">I choose that bridal lot ! ” He answered , “ Child ,</l>
     <l n="74">The choice is God 's . For each , that lot is best</l>
     <l n="75">To which He calls us . ” Lifting then pure hands ,</l>
     <l n="76">Thus wept the maiden : “ Call me , Virgin-born !</l>
     <l n="77">Will not the Mother-Maid permit a maid</l>
     <l n="78">To sit beside those nail-pierced feet , and wipe ,</l>
     <l n="79">With hair untouched by wreaths of mortal love ,</l>
     <l n="80">The dolorous blood-stains from them ? Stranger guest ,</l>
     <l n="81">Come to my father 's tower ! Against my will ,</l>
     <l n="82">Against his own , in bridal bonds he binds me :</l>

     <l n="88">Not high , but spreading wide , of wood compact ;</l>

     <l n="93">Mosaic was the work , beam laced with beam</l>

     <l n="129">With rounded lips into the heaven of heavens</l>
     <l n="130">Druidic breath . That heaven was changed to cloud ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="140">Sudden thronged</l>

     <l n="148">All fire the mountains shone . ‘ The God I serve , ’</l>

    <head>SAINT PATRICK AND THE FOUNDING OF ARMAGH CATHEDRAL .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Saint Patrick repairs to Ardmacha , there to found the chief church of Erin . For that purpose he demands of Daire , the king , a certain woody hill . The king refuses it , and afterwards treats him with alternate scorn and reverence ; while the Saint , in each event alike , makes the same answer , “ Deo Gratias . ” At last the king concedes to him the hill ; and on the summit of it Saint Patrick finds a little white fawn asleep . The men of Erin would have slain that fawn ; but the Saint carries it on his shoulder , and restores it to its dam . Where the fawn lay , he places the altar of his cathedral .</head>

     <l n="4">To build thereon Christ 's chiefest church in Eire .</l>
     <l n="5">Then by him stood God 's angel , speaking thus :</l>
     <l n="6">“ Not here , but northward . ” He replied , “ O , would</l>
     <l n="7">This spot might favour find with God ! Behold !</l>
     <l n="8">Fair is it , and as meet to clasp a church</l>
     <l n="9">As is a true heart in a virgin breast</l>
     <l n="10">To clasp the Faith of Christ . The hinds around</l>
     <l n="11">Name it ‘ the beauteous meadow . ’ ” “ Fair it is , ”</l>
     <l n="12">The angel answered , “ nor shall lack its crown .</l>
     <l n="13">Another 's is its beauty . Here , one day</l>
     <l n="14">A pilgrim from the Britons sent shall build ,</l>

     <l n="17">Patrick then ,</l>
     <l n="18">Obedient as that Patriarch Sire who faced</l>
     <l n="19">At God 's command the desert , northward went</l>

     <l n="35">On shoulders broad bare Patrick through the floods :</l>
     <l n="36">His rest was nigh . That hour they crossed a stream ;</l>
     <l n="37">‘ Twas deep , and , ‘ neath his load , the giant sighed .</l>
     <l n="38">Saint Patrick said , “ Thou wert not wont to sigh ! ”</l>
     <l n="39">He answered , “ Old I grow . Of them my mates</l>
     <l n="40">How many hast thou left in churches housed</l>
     <l n="41">Wherein they rule and rest ! ” The Saint replied ,</l>
     <l n="42">“ Thee also will I leave within a church</l>
     <l n="43">For rule and rest ; not to mine own too near</l>
     <l n="44">For rarely then should we be seen apart ,</l>

     <l n="46">At Clochar soon he placed him . There , long years</l>

     <l n="57">Then to Benignus spake the Saint : “ My son ,</l>

     <l n="59">The blood-stains on a land so strong in faith ,</l>
     <l n="60">So slack in love , might cloud the holiest brow ,</l>
     <l n="61">Yea , his whose head lay on the breast of Christ .</l>
     <l n="62">Clan wars with clan : no injury is forgiven ;</l>
     <l n="63">Like to the joy in stag-hunts is the war :</l>
     <l n="64">Alas ! for such what hope ! ” Benignus answered</l>
     <l n="65">“ O Father , cease not for this race to hope ,</l>
     <l n="66">Lest they should hope no longer ! Hope they have ;</l>
     <l n="67">Still say they , ‘ God will snare us in the end</l>
     <l n="68">Though wild . ’ ” And Patrick , “ Spirits twain are theirs :</l>
     <l n="69">The stranger , and the poor , at every door</l>
     <l n="70">They meet , and bid him in . The youngest child</l>
     <l n="71">Officious is in service ; maids prepare</l>
     <l n="72">The bath ; men brim the wine-cup . Then , forth borne ,</l>
     <l n="73">Cities they fire and rich in spoil depart ,</l>
     <l n="74">Greed mixed with rage — an industry of blood ! ”</l>
     <l n="75">He spake , and thus the younger made reply :</l>
     <l n="76">“ Father , the stranger is the brother-man</l>
     <l n="77">To them ; the poor is neighbour . Septs remote</l>
     <l n="78">To them are alien worlds . They know not yet</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="80">“ That know they shall , ”</l>
     <l n="81">Patrick made answer , “ when a race far off</l>

     <l n="83">His plague of war that men on earth may know</l>
     <l n="84">Brother from foe , and anguish work remorse . ”</l>
     <l n="85">He spake , and after musings added thus :</l>
     <l n="86">“ Base of God 's kingdom is Humility -</l>
     <l n="87">I have not spared to thunder o'er their pride ;</l>
     <l n="88">Great kings have I rebuked and signs sent forth ,</l>
     <l n="89">And banned for their sake fruitful plain , and bay ;</l>
     <l n="90">Yet still the widow 's cry is on the air ,</l>
     <l n="91">The orphan 's wail ! ” Benignus answered mild ,</l>
     <l n="92">“ O Father , not alone with sign and ban</l>
     <l n="93">Hast thou rebuked their madness . Oftener far</l>
     <l n="94">Thy sweetness hath reproved them . Once in woods</l>
     <l n="95">Northward of Tara as we tracked our way</l>
     <l n="96">Round us there gathered slaves who felled the pines</l>
     <l n="97">For ship-masts . Scarred their hands , and red with blood ,</l>
     <l n="98">Because their master , Trian , thus had sworn ,</l>
     <l n="99">‘ Let no man sharpen axe ! ’ Upon those hands</l>
     <l n="100">Gazing , they wept soon as thy voice they heard ,</l>
     <l n="101">Because that voice was soft . Thou heard'st their tale ;</l>
     <l n="102">Straight to that chieftain 's castle went'st thou up ,</l>
     <l n="103">And bound'st him with thy fast , beside his gate</l>
     <l n="104">Sitting in silence till his heart should melt ;</l>
     <l n="105">And since he willed it not to melt , he died .</l>
     <l n="106">Then , in her arms two babes , came forth the queen</l>
     <l n="107">Black-robed , and freed her slaves , and gave them hire ;</l>
     <l n="108">And , we returning after many years ,</l>
     <l n="109">Filled was that wood with homesteads ; plots of corn</l>
     <l n="110">Rustled around them ; here were orchards ; there</l>
     <l n="111">In trench or tank they steeped the bright blue flax ;</l>
     <l n="112">The saw-mill turned to use the wanton brook ;</l>
     <l n="113">Murmured the bee-hive ; murmured household wheel ;</l>
     <l n="114">Soft eyes looked o'er it through the dusk ; at work</l>
     <l n="115">The labourers carolled ; matrons glad and maids</l>
     <l n="116">Bare us the pail head-steadied , children flowers :</l>
     <l n="117">Last , from her castle paced the queen , and led</l>
     <l n="118">In either hand her sons whom thou hadst blest ,</l>
     <l n="119">Thenceforth to stand thy priests . The land believed ;</l>
     <l n="120">And not through ban , or word , sharp-edged or soft ,</l>
     <l n="121">But silence and thy fast the ill custom died . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="122">He answered , “ Christ , in Christ-like life expressed ,</l>
     <l n="123">This , this , not words , subdues a land to Christ ;</l>
     <l n="124">And in this best Apostolate all have part .</l>
     <l n="125">Ah me ! that flower thou hold'st is strong to preach</l>
     <l n="126">Creative Love , because itself is lovely ;</l>
     <l n="127">But we , the heralds of Redeeming Love ,</l>
     <l n="128">Because we are unlovely in our lives ,</l>
     <l n="129">Preach to deaf ears ! Yet theirs , theirs too , the sin . ”</l>
     <l n="130">Benignus made reply : “ The race is old ;</l>

     <l n="132">For see , in spring the grave old oaks push forth</l>
     <l n="133">Impatient sprays , wine-red : their strength matured ,</l>
     <l n="134">These sober down to verdure . ” Patrick paused ,</l>
     <l n="135">Then , brooding , spake , as one who thinks , not speaks :</l>
     <l n="136">“ A priest there walked with me ten years and more ;</l>
     <l n="137">Warrior in youth was he . One day we heard</l>
     <l n="138">The shock of warring clans — I hear it still :</l>
     <l n="139">Within him , as in darkening vase you note</l>
     <l n="140">The ascending wine , I watched the passion mount : -</l>
     <l n="141">Sudden he dashed him down into the fight ,</l>
     <l n="142">Nor e'er to Christ returned . ” Benignus answered ;</l>
     <l n="143">“ I saw above a dusky forest roof</l>
     <l n="144">The glad spring run , leaving a track sea-green :</l>
     <l n="145">Not straight she ran ; and yet she reached her goal :</l>
     <l n="146">Later I saw above green copse of thorn</l>
     <l n="147">The glad spring run , leaving a track foam-white :</l>
     <l n="148">Not straight she ran ; yet soon she conquered all !</l>
     <l n="149">O Father , is it sinful to be glad</l>
     <l n="150">Here amid sin and sorrow ? Joy is strong ,</l>
     <l n="151">Strongest in spring-tide ! Mourners I have known</l>
     <l n="152">That , homeward wending from the new-dug grave ,</l>
     <l n="153">Against their will , where sang the happy birds</l>
     <l n="154">Have felt the aggressive gladness stir their hearts ,</l>
     <l n="155">And smiled amid their tears . ” So babbled he ,</l>
     <l n="156">Shamed at his spring-tide raptures .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="157">As they went ,</l>
     <l n="158">Far on their left there stretched a mighty land</l>
     <l n="159">Of forest-girdled hills , mother of streams :</l>
     <l n="160">Beyond it sank the day ; while round the west</l>
     <l n="161">Like giants thronged the great cloud-phantoms towered .</l>
     <l n="162">Advancing , din they heard , and found in woods</l>
     <l n="163">A hamlet and a field by war unscathed ,</l>
     <l n="164">And boys on all sides running . Placid sat</l>
     <l n="165">The village Elders ; neither lacked that hour</l>
     <l n="166">The harp that gently tranquillises age ,</l>
     <l n="167">Yet wakes young hearts with musical unrest ,</l>
     <l n="168">Forerunner oft of love 's unrest . Ere long</l>
     <l n="169">The measure changed to livelier : maid with maid</l>
     <l n="170">Danced ‘ mid the dancing shadows of the trees ,</l>
     <l n="171">And youth with youth ; till now , the strangers near ,</l>
     <l n="172">Those Elders welcomed them with act benign ;</l>
     <l n="173">And soon was slain the fatted kid , and soon</l>
     <l n="174">The lamb ; nor any asked till hunger 's rage</l>
     <l n="175">Was quelled , “ Who art thou ? ” Patrick made reply ,</l>
     <l n="176">“ A Priest of God . ” Then prayed they , “ Offer thou</l>
     <l n="177">To Him our sacrifice ! Belike ‘ tis He</l>
     <l n="178">Who saves from war this hamlet hid in woods :</l>
     <l n="179">Unblest be he who finds it ! ” Thus they spake ,</l>
     <l n="180">The matrons , not the youths . In friendly talk</l>
     <l n="181">The hours went by with laughter winged and tale ;</l>
     <l n="182">But when the moon , on rolling through the heavens ,</l>
     <l n="183">Showered through the leaves a dew of sprinkled light</l>
     <l n="184">O'er the dark ground , the maidens garments brought</l>
     <l n="185">Woven in their quiet homes when nights were long ,</l>
     <l n="186">Red cloak and kirtle green , and laid them soft ,</l>
     <l n="187">Still with the wearers ’ blameless beauty warm ,</l>
     <l n="188">For coverlet upon the warm dry grass ,</l>
     <l n="189">Honouring the stranger guests . For these they deemed</l>
     <l n="190">Their low-roofed cots too mean . Glad-hearted rose</l>
     <l n="191">The Christian hymn , not timid : far it rang</l>
     <l n="192">Above the woods . Ere long , their blissful rites</l>
     <l n="193">Fulfilled , the wanderers laid them down and slept .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="194">At midnight by the side of Patrick stood</l>
     <l n="195">Victor , God 's Angel , saying , “ Lo ! thy work</l>

     <l n="197">Thus therefore saith the Lord , ‘ So long as sea</l>

     <l n="199">In splendour o'er it , like the stars of God . ’ ”</l>
     <l n="200">Then Patrick said , “ A boon ! I crave a boon ! ”</l>
     <l n="201">The angel answered , “ Speak ; ” and Patrick said ,</l>

     <l n="205">Equalled with me my name in Erin share . ”</l>
     <l n="206">And Victor answered , “ Half thy prayer is thine ;</l>

     <l n="208">Higher than theirs shall rise , and wider spread ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="211">With the morn</l>
     <l n="212">Those pilgrims rose , and , prime entoned and lauds ,</l>
     <l n="213">Poured out their blessing on that woodland clan</l>
     <l n="214">Which , round them pressing , kissed them , robe and knee ;</l>
     <l n="215">Then on they journeyed till at set of sun</l>
     <l n="216">Shone out the roofs of Macha , and that tower</l>
     <l n="217">Where Daire dwelt , its lord .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="218">Saint Patrick sent</l>
     <l n="219">To Daire embassage , vouchsafing prayer</l>
     <l n="220">As sire might pray of son ; “ Give thou yon hill</l>
     <l n="221">To Christ , that we may build His church thereon . ”</l>
     <l n="222">And Daire answered with a brow of storms</l>
     <l n="223">Bent forward darkly , and long , sneering lips ,</l>
     <l n="224">“ Your master is a mighty man , we know .</l>
     <l n="225">Garban , that lied to God , he slew through prayer ,</l>
     <l n="226">And banned full many a lake , and many a plain ,</l>
     <l n="227">For trespass there committed ! Let it be !</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="231">So Daire sent to Patrick men of might ,</l>
     <l n="232">Fierce men , the battle 's nurslings . Thus they spake :</l>
     <l n="233">“ High region for high heads ! If build ye must ,</l>
     <l n="234">Build on the plain : the hill is Daire 's right :</l>
     <l n="235">Church site he grants you , and the field around . ”</l>
     <l n="236">And Patrick , glancing from his Office Book ,</l>
     <l n="237">Made answer , “ Deo Gratias , ” and no more .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="238">Upon that plain he built a little church</l>
     <l n="239">Ere long , a convent likewise , girt with mound</l>
     <l n="240">Banked from the meadow loam , and deftly set</l>
     <l n="241">With stone , and fence , and woody palisade ,</l>
     <l n="242">That neither warring clans , far heard by day ,</l>
     <l n="243">Might hurt his cloistered charge , nor wolves by night ,</l>
     <l n="244">Howling in woods ; and there he served the Lord .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="245">But Daire scorned the Saint , and grudged his gift ,</l>
     <l n="246">Though small ; and half in spleen , and half in greed ,</l>
     <l n="247">Sent down two stately coursers all night long</l>
     <l n="248">To graze the deep sweet pasture round the church :</l>
     <l n="249">Ill deed : — and so , for guerdon of that sin ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="251">Then fled the servants back , and told their lord ,</l>
     <l n="252">Fearing for negligence rebuke and scath ,</l>
     <l n="253">“ Thy Christian slew the coursers ! ” and the king</l>
     <l n="254">Gave word to slay or bind him . But from God</l>
     <l n="255">A sickness fell on Daire nigh to death</l>
     <l n="256">That day and night . When morning brake , the queen ,</l>
     <l n="257">A woman leal with kind barbaric heart ,</l>
     <l n="258">Her bosom from the sick man 's head withdrew</l>
     <l n="259">A moment while he slept ; and , round her gazing ,</l>
     <l n="260">Closed with both hands upon a liegeman 's arm ,</l>
     <l n="261">And sped him to the Saint for pardon and peace .</l>
     <l n="262">Then Patrick , dipping in the inviolate fount</l>
     <l n="263">A chalice , blessed the water , with command</l>
     <l n="264">“ Sprinkle the stately coursers and the king ; "</l>
     <l n="265">And straightway as from death the king arose ,</l>
     <l n="266">And rose from death the coursers .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="267">Daire then ,</l>
     <l n="268">His tall frame boastful with that life renewed ,</l>
     <l n="269">Took with him men , and down the stone-paved hill</l>
     <l n="270">Rode from his tower , and through the woodlands green ,</l>
     <l n="271">And bare with him an offering of those days ,</l>
     <l n="272">A brazen cauldron vast . Embossed it shone</l>
     <l n="273">With sculptured shapes . On one side hunters rode :</l>
     <l n="274">Low stretched their steeds : the dogs pulled down the stag</l>
     <l n="275">Unseen , except the branching horns that rose</l>
     <l n="276">Like hands in protest . Feasters , on the other ,</l>
     <l n="277">Raised high the cup pledging the safe return .</l>
     <l n="278">This offering Daire brought , and , entering , spake :</l>
     <l n="279">“ A gift for guerdon and for grace , O Priest ! ”</l>
     <l n="280">And Patrick , upward glancing from his book ,</l>
     <l n="281">Made answer , “ Deo Gratias ! ” and no more .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="282">King Daire , homeward riding with knit brow</l>
     <l n="283">Muttered , “ Churl 's welcome for a kingly boon ! ”</l>
     <l n="284">And , drinking late that night the stormy breath</l>
     <l n="285">Of others ’ anger blent with his , commanded ,</l>
     <l n="286">“ Ride forth at morn and bring me back my gift !</l>
     <l n="287">Spurn it he shall not , though he prize it not . ”</l>
     <l n="288">They heard him , and obeyed . At noon the king</l>
     <l n="289">Demanded thus , “ What answer made the Saint ? ”</l>
     <l n="290">They said , “ His eyes he raised not from his book ,</l>
     <l n="291">But answered , ‘ Deo Gratias ! ’ and no more . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="292">Then Daire stamped his foot , like war-horse stung</l>
     <l n="293">By gadfly : musing next , and mute he sat</l>
     <l n="294">A space , and lastly roared great laughter peals</l>
     <l n="295">Till roared in mockery back the raftered roof ,</l>
     <l n="296">And clashed his hands together shouting thus :</l>
     <l n="297">“ A gift , and ‘ Deo Gratias ! ’ — gift withdrawn ,</l>
     <l n="298">And ‘ Deo Gratias ! ’ Sooth , the word is good !</l>
     <l n="299">Madman is this , or man of God ? We 'll know ! ”</l>
     <l n="300">So from his frowning fortress once again</l>
     <l n="301">Adown the resonant road o'er street and bridge</l>
     <l n="302">Rode Daire , at his right the queen in fear ,</l>
     <l n="303">With dumbly pleading countenance ; close behind ,</l>
     <l n="304">With tangled locks and loose-hung battle-axe</l>
     <l n="305">Ran the wild kerne ; and loud the bull-horn blew .</l>
     <l n="306">The convent reached , King Daire from his horse</l>
     <l n="307">Flung his great limbs , and at the doorway towered</l>
     <l n="308">In gazing stern : the queen beside him stood ,</l>
     <l n="309">Her lustrous violet eyes all lost in tears :</l>
     <l n="310">One hand on Daire 's garment lay like light</l>
     <l n="311">Wandering on dusky ripple ; one , upraised ,</l>
     <l n="312">Held in the high-necked horse that champed the bit ,</l>
     <l n="313">His head near hers . Within , the man of God ,</l>
     <l n="314">Sole-sitting , read his office book unmoved ,</l>
     <l n="315">And ending fixed his keen eye on the king ,</l>
     <l n="316">Not rising from his seat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="317">Then fell from God</l>
     <l n="318">Insight on Daire , and aloud he cried ,</l>
     <l n="319">“ A kingly man , of mind unmovable</l>
     <l n="320">Art thou ; and as the rock beneath my tower</l>
     <l n="321">Shakes not in storm so shakes not heart of thine :</l>
     <l n="322">Such men are of the height and not the plain :</l>
     <l n="323">Therefore that hill to thee I grant unsought</l>
     <l n="324">Which whilome I refused . Possession take</l>
     <l n="325">This day , lest hostile demon warp my mood ;</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="328">Thus Daire spake ; and Patrick , at his word</l>
     <l n="329">Rising , gave thanks to God , and to the king</l>
     <l n="330">High blessing heard in heaven ; and making sign</l>

     <l n="332">Benignus first , his dearest , then the rest .</l>
     <l n="333">In circuit thrice they girt that hill , and sang</l>
     <l n="334">Anthem first heard when unto God was vowed</l>
     <l n="335">That House which David offered in his heart</l>
     <l n="336">His son in act , and hymn of holy Church</l>
     <l n="337">Hailing that city like a bride attired ,</l>
     <l n="338">From heaven to earth descending . With them sang</l>
     <l n="339">An angel choir above them borne . The birds</l>
     <l n="340">Forbore their songs , listening that angel strain ,</l>
     <l n="341">Ethereal music and by men unheard</l>
     <l n="342">Except the Elect . The king in reverence paced</l>
     <l n="343">Behind , his liegemen next , a mass confused</l>
     <l n="344">With saffron standard gay and spears upheld</l>
     <l n="345">Flashing through thickets green . These kept not line ,</l>
     <l n="346">For Alp was still recounting battles old ,</l>
     <l n="347">Aodh of wizards sang , and Ir of love ;</l>

     <l n="349">The sneering light , shot from his plastic mouth</l>
     <l n="350">Shrill taunt and biting gibe . The younger sort</l>
     <l n="351">Eyed the dense copse and launched full many a shaft</l>
     <l n="352">Through it at flying beast . From ledge to ledge</l>
     <l n="353">Clomb Angus , keen of sight , with hand o'er brow ,</l>
     <l n="354">Forth gazing on some far blue ridge of war</l>
     <l n="355">With nostril wide outblown , and snorting cried ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="357">Meantime , the man of God</l>

     <l n="360">And roofed with heaven . Beyond its tonsure fringe ,</l>
     <l n="361">Birch trees and oaks , there pushed a thorn milk-white ,</l>
     <l n="362">And close beside it slept in shade a fawn</l>
     <l n="363">Whiter . The startled dam had left its side ,</l>
     <l n="364">And through the dark stems fled like flying gleam .</l>
     <l n="365">Minded they were , the kernes , to kill that fawn ,</l>
     <l n="366">And all the priests stood silent ; but the Saint</l>

     <l n="369">And bade the brethren mark with stones her lair</l>
     <l n="370">Dewless and dusk : then , singing as he went</l>
     <l n="371">“ Like as the hart desires the water brooks , ”</l>
     <l n="372">He walked , that hill descending . Light from God</l>
     <l n="373">O'ershone his face . Meantime the awakened fawn</l>
     <l n="374">Now rolled her dark eye on the silver head</l>
     <l n="375">Close by , now turning licked the wrinkled hand ,</l>
     <l n="376">Unfearing . Soon , with little whimpering sob ,</l>
     <l n="377">The doe drew near and paced at Patrick 's side .</l>
     <l n="378">At last they reached a little field low down</l>

    <head>THE ARRAIGNMENT OF SAINT PATRICK .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Secknall , the poet , brings , in sport , three heavy charges against Saint Patrick , who , supposing them to be serious , defends himself against them . Lastly Secknall sings a hymn written in praise of a Saint . Saint Patrick commends it , affirming that for once Fame has dispensed her honours honestly . Upon this , Secknall recites the first stave , till then craftily reserved , which offers the whole homage of that hymn to Patrick , who , though the humblest of men , has thus arrogated to himself the saintly Crown . There is laughter among the brethren .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">When Patrick now was old and nigh to death</l>
     <l n="2">Undimmed was still his eye ; his tread was strong ;</l>
     <l n="3">And there was ever laughter in his heart ,</l>
     <l n="4">And music in his laughter . In a wood</l>
     <l n="5">Nigh to Ardmacha dwelt he with his monks ;</l>
     <l n="6">And there , like birds that cannot stay their songs</l>
     <l n="7">Love-touched in Spring , or grateful for their nests ,</l>
     <l n="8">They to the woodsmen preached of Christ , their King ,</l>
     <l n="9">To swineherds , and to hinds that tended sheep ,</l>
     <l n="10">Yea , and to pilgrim guests from distant clans ;</l>
     <l n="11">His shepherd-worshipped birth when breath of kine</l>
     <l n="12">Went o'er the Infant ; all His wondrous works</l>
     <l n="13">Or words from mount , or field , or anchored boat ,</l>
     <l n="14">And Christendom upreared for weal of men</l>
     <l n="15">And Angel-wonder . Daily preached the monks</l>
     <l n="16">And daily built their convent . Wildly sweet</l>
     <l n="17">The season , prime of unripe spring , when March</l>
     <l n="18">Distils from cup half gelid yet some drops</l>
     <l n="19">Of finer relish than the hand of May</l>
     <l n="20">Pours from her full-brimmed beaker . Frost , though gone ,</l>
     <l n="21">Had left its glad vibration on the air ;</l>
     <l n="22">Laughed the blue heavens as though they ne'er had frowned ,</l>
     <l n="23">Through leafless oak-boughs ; limes of kindlier grace</l>
     <l n="24">And swifter to believe Spring 's “ tidings good ”</l>
     <l n="25">Took the sweet lights upon a breast bud-swoll'n ,</l>
     <l n="26">And crimson as the redbreast 's ; while , as when</l>
     <l n="27">Clear rings a flute-note through sea-murmurs harsh ,</l>
     <l n="28">At intervals ran out a streak of green</l>
     <l n="29">Across the dim-hued forest .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="30">From their wood</l>
     <l n="31">The strong arms of the monks had hewn them space</l>
     <l n="32">For all their convent needed ; farmyard stored</l>
     <l n="33">With stacks that all the winter long had clutched</l>
     <l n="34">Their hoarded harvest sunshine ; pasture green</l>
     <l n="35">Whitened with sheep ; fair garden fenceless still</l>
     <l n="36">With household herbs new-sprouting : but , as oft</l>
     <l n="37">Some conquered race , forth sallying in its spleen</l>
     <l n="38">When serves the occasion , wins a province back ,</l>
     <l n="39">Or flouts at least the foe , so here once more</l>
     <l n="40">Wild flowers , a clan unvanquished , raised their heads</l>
     <l n="41">‘ Mid sprouting wheat ; and where from craggy height</l>
     <l n="42">Pushed the grey ledge , the woodland host recoiled</l>
     <l n="43">As though in Parthian flight ; while many a bird ,</l>
     <l n="44">Barbaric from the inviolate forest launched</l>
     <l n="45">Wild warbled scorn on all that life reclaimed ,</l>
     <l n="46">Mute garth-still orchard . Child of distant hills ,</l>
     <l n="47">A proud stream , swollen by midnight rains , down leaped</l>
     <l n="48">From rock to rock . It spurned the precinct now</l>
     <l n="49">With airy dews silvering the bramble green</l>
     <l n="50">And redd'ning more the beech-stock .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="51">‘ Twas the hour</l>
     <l n="52">Of rest , and every monk was glad at heart ,</l>
     <l n="53">For each had wrought with might . With hands upheld ,</l>
     <l n="54">Mochta , the priest , had thundered against sin ,</l>
     <l n="55">Wrath-roused , as when some prince too late returned</l>
     <l n="56">Stares at his sea-side village all in flames ,</l>
     <l n="57">The slave-thronged ship escaped . The bishop , Erc ,</l>
     <l n="58">Had reconciled old feuds by Brehon Law</l>
     <l n="59">Where Brehon Law was lawful . Boys wild-eyed</l>
     <l n="60">Had from Benignus learned the church 's song ,</l>
     <l n="61">Boys brightened now , yet tempered , by that age</l>
     <l n="62">Gracious to stripling as to maid , that brings</l>
     <l n="63">Valour to one and modesty to both</l>
     <l n="64">Where youth is loyal to the Virgin-born .</l>
     <l n="65">The giant meek , Mac Cairthen , on bent neck</l>
     <l n="66">Had carried beam on beam , while Criemther felled</l>
     <l n="67">The oaks , and from the anvil Laeban dashed</l>
     <l n="68">The sparks in showers . A little way removed ,</l>
     <l n="69">Beneath a pine three vestals sat close-veiled :</l>
     <l n="70">A song these childless sang of Bethlehem 's Child ,</l>
     <l n="71">Low-toned , and worked their Altar-cloth , a Lamb</l>
     <l n="72">All white on golden blazon ; near it bled</l>
     <l n="73">The bird that with her own blood feeds her young :</l>
     <l n="74">Red drops affused her holy breast . These three</l>
     <l n="75">Were daughters of three kings . The best and fairest ,</l>
     <l n="76">King Daire 's daughter , Erenait by name ,</l>
     <l n="77">Had loved Benignus in her Pagan years .</l>
     <l n="78">He knew it not : full sweet to her his voice</l>
     <l n="79">Chaunting in choir . One day through grief of love</l>
     <l n="80">The maiden lay as dead : Benignus shook</l>
     <l n="81">Dews from the font above her , and she woke</l>
     <l n="82">With heart emancipate that outsoared the lark</l>
     <l n="83">Lost in blue heavens . She loved the Spouse of Souls .</l>
     <l n="84">It was as though some child that , dreaming , wept</l>
     <l n="85">Its childish playthings lost , awaked by bells ,</l>
     <l n="86">Bride-bells , had found herself a queen new wed</l>
     <l n="87">Unto her country 's lord .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="88">While monk with monk</l>
     <l n="89">Conversed , the son of Patrick 's sister sat ,</l>
     <l n="90">Secknall by name , beside the window sole</l>
     <l n="91">And marked where Patrick from his hill of prayer</l>
     <l n="92">Approached , descending slowly . At the sight</l>
     <l n="93">He , maker blithe of songs , and wild as hawk</l>
     <l n="94">Albeit a Saint , whose wont it was at times</l>
     <l n="95">Or shy , or strange , or shunning flattery 's taint ,</l>
     <l n="96">To attempt with mockery those whom most he loved ,</l>
     <l n="97">Whispered a brother , “ Speak to Patrick thus :</l>
     <l n="98">‘ When all men praised thee , Secknall made reply</l>
     <l n="99">“ A blessed man were Patrick save for this ,</l>
     <l n="100">Alms deeds he preaches not . " ’ ” The brother went :</l>
     <l n="101">Ere long among them entered Patrick , wroth ,</l>
     <l n="102">Or , likelier , feigning wrath : — “ What man is he</l>
     <l n="103">Who saith I preach not alms deeds ? ” Secknall rose :</l>
     <l n="104">“ I said it , Father , and the charge is true . ”</l>
     <l n="105">Then Patrick answered , “ Out of Charity</l>
     <l n="106">I preach not Charity . This people , won</l>
     <l n="107">To Christ , ere long will prove a race of Saints ;</l>
     <l n="108">To give will be its passion , not to gain :</l>
     <l n="109">Its heart is generous ; but its hand is slack</l>
     <l n="110">In all save war : herein there lurks a snare :</l>
     <l n="111">The priest will fatten , and the beggar feast :</l>
     <l n="112">But the lean land will yield nor chief nor prince</l>
     <l n="113">Hire of two horses yoked to chariot beam . ”</l>
     <l n="114">Then Secknall spake , “ O Father , dead it lies</l>
     <l n="115">Mine earlier charge against thee . Hear my next ,</l>
     <l n="116">Since in our Order 's equal Brotherhood</l>
     <l n="117">Censure uncensured is the right of all .</l>
     <l n="118">You press to the earth your converts ! gold you spurn ;</l>
     <l n="119">Yet bind upon them heavier load than when</l>
     <l n="120">Conqueror his captive tasks . Have shepherds three</l>
     <l n="121">Bowed them to Christ ? ‘ Build up a church , ’ you cry ;</l>
     <l n="122">So one must draw the sand , and one the stone</l>
     <l n="123">And one the lime . Honouring the seven great Gifts ,</l>
     <l n="124">You raise in one small valley churches seven .</l>
     <l n="125">Who serveth you fares hard ! ” The Saint replied ,</l>
     <l n="126">“ Second as first ! I came not to this land</l>
     <l n="127">To crave scant service , nor with shallow plough</l>
     <l n="128">Cleave I this glebe . The priest that soweth much</l>
     <l n="129">For here the land is fruitful , much shall reap :</l>
     <l n="130">Who soweth little nought but weeds shall bind</l>
     <l n="131">And poppies of oblivion . ” Secknall next :</l>
     <l n="132">“ Yet man to man will whisper , and the face</l>
     <l n="133">Of all this people darken like a sea</l>
     <l n="134">When pipes the coming storm . ” He answered , “ Son ,</l>
     <l n="135">I know this people better . Fierce they are</l>
     <l n="136">In anger ; neither flies their thought direct ;</l>
     <l n="137">For some , though true to Nature , lie to men ,</l>
     <l n="138">And others , true to men , are false to God :</l>
     <l n="139">Yet as the prince 's is the poor man 's heart ;</l>
     <l n="140">Burthen for God sustained no burden is</l>
     <l n="141">To him ; and those who most have given to Christ</l>
     <l n="142">Largeliest His fulness share . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="143">Secknall replied ,</l>
     <l n="144">“ Low lies my second charge ; a third remains ,</l>
     <l n="145">Which , as a shaft from seasoned bow , not green ,</l>
     <l n="146">Shall pierce the marl . With convents still you sow</l>
     <l n="147">The land : in other countries sparse and small</l>
     <l n="148">They swell to cities here . A hundred monks</l>
     <l n="149">On one late barren mountain dig and pray :</l>
     <l n="150">A hundred nuns gladden one woodland lawn ,</l>
     <l n="151">Or sing in one small island . Well — ‘ tis well !</l>
     <l n="152">Yet , balance lost and measure , nought is well .</l>
     <l n="153">The Angelic Life more common will become</l>
     <l n="154">Than life of mortal men . ” The Saint replied ,</l>
     <l n="155">“ No shaft from homicidal yew-tree bow</l>
     <l n="156">Is thine , but winged of thistle-down ! Now hear !</l>
     <l n="157">Measure is good ; but measure 's law with scale</l>
     <l n="158">Changeth ; nor doth the part reflect the whole .</l>
     <l n="159">Each nation hath its gift , and each to all</l>
     <l n="160">Not equal ministers . If all were eye ,</l>
     <l n="161">Where then were ear ? If all were ear or hand ,</l>
     <l n="162">Where then were eye ? The nation is the part ;</l>
     <l n="163">The Church the whole ” — But Criemther where he stood ,</l>
     <l n="164">Old warrior , shouted like a chief war-waked ,</l>
     <l n="165">“ This land is Eire ! No nation lives like her !</l>
     <l n="166">A part ! Who portions Eire ? ” The Saint , with smile</l>
     <l n="167">Resumed : “ The whole that from the part receives ,</l>
     <l n="168">Repaying still that part , till man 's whole race</l>

     <l n="170">What gift hath God in eminence given to Eire ?</l>
     <l n="171">Singly , her race is feeble ; strong when knit :</l>

     <l n="191">No whit ascetic , ran a dim half smile .</l>
     <l n="192">“ Father , my charges three have futile fallen ,</l>

     <l n="195">Brought low , I make confession . Once , in woods</l>

     <l n="243">He faced the ravening waves , and iron rocks ,</l>
     <l n="244">Hunger , and poniard 's edge , and poisoned cup ,</l>
     <l n="245">And faced the face of kings , and faced the host</l>
     <l n="246">Of demons raging for their realm o'erthrown .</l>
     <l n="247">This was the Man of Love . Self-love cast out ,</l>
     <l n="248">The love made spiritual of a thousand hearts</l>
     <l n="249">Met in his single heart , and kindled there</l>
     <l n="250">A sun-like image of Love Divine . Within</l>
     <l n="251">That Spirit-shadowed heart was Christ conceived</l>
     <l n="252">Hourly through faith , hourly through Love was born ;</l>
     <l n="253">Sole secret this of fruitfulness to Christ .</l>
     <l n="254">Who heard him heard with his a lordlier Voice ,</l>
     <l n="255">Strong as that Voice which said , “ Let there be light , ”</l>

     <l n="260">By conscience ruled , and conscience lit by Christ ,</l>
     <l n="261">The whole man stood , planet full-orbed of powers</l>

     <l n="263">A nation of such men his portion was ;</l>

     <l n="267">The Saint his great soul flung upon the world ,</l>
     <l n="268">And took the people with him like a wind</l>

     <l n="272">As Secknall sang ,</l>
     <l n="273">Nearer the Brethren drew . On Patrick 's right</l>
     <l n="274">Benignus stood ; old Mochta on his left ,</l>
     <l n="275">Slow-eyed , with solemn smile and sweet ; next Erc ,</l>
     <l n="276">Whose ever-listening countenance that hour</l>
     <l n="277">Beyond its wont was listening ; Criemther near</l>
     <l n="278">The workman Saint , his many-wounded hands</l>
     <l n="279">Together clasped : forward each mighty arm</l>
     <l n="280">On shoulders propped of Essa and of Bite ,</l>
     <l n="281">Leaned the meek giant Cairthen : twelve in all</l>
     <l n="282">Clustering they stood and in them was one soul .</l>
     <l n="283">When Secknall ceased , in silence still they hung</l>
     <l n="284">Each upon each , glad-hearted since the meed</l>
     <l n="285">Of all their toils shone out before them plain ,</l>
     <l n="286">Gold gates of heaven — a nation entering in .</l>
     <l n="287">A light was on their faces , and without</l>
     <l n="288">Spread a great light , for sunset now had fallen</l>
     <l n="289">A Pentecostal fire upon the woods ,</l>
     <l n="290">Or else a rain of angels streamed o'er earth .</l>
     <l n="291">In marvel gazed the twelve : yea , clans far off</l>
     <l n="292">Stared from their hills , deeming the site aflame .</l>
     <l n="293">That glory passed away , discourse arose</l>
     <l n="294">On Secknall 's hymn . Its radiance from his face</l>
     <l n="295">Had , like the sunset 's , vanished as he spake .</l>
     <l n="296">“ Father , what sayst thou ? ” Patrick made reply ,</l>
     <l n="297">“ My son , the hymn is good ; for Truth is gold ;</l>
     <l n="298">And Fame , obsequious often to base heads ,</l>
     <l n="299">For once is loyal , and its crown hath laid</l>
     <l n="300">Where honour 's debt was due . ” Then Secknall raised</l>
     <l n="301">In triumph both his hands , and chaunted loud</l>
     <l n="302">That hymn 's first stave , earlier through craft withheld ,</l>
     <l n="303">Stave that to Patrick 's name , and his alone ,</l>
     <l n="304">Offered that hymn 's whole incense ! Ceasing , he stood</l>
     <l n="305">Low-bowed , with hands upon his bosom crossed .</l>
     <l n="306">Great laughter from the brethren came , their Chief</l>
     <l n="307">Thus trapped , though late — he meekest man of men -</l>
     <l n="308">To claim the saintly crown . First young , then old ,</l>
     <l n="309">Later the old , and sore against their will ,</l>
     <l n="310">That laughter raised . Last from the giant chest</l>
     <l n="311">Of Cairthen forth it rolled its solemn bass ,</l>
     <l n="312">Like sea-sound swallowing lighter sounds hard by .</l>
     <l n="313">But Patrick laughed not : o'er his face there passed</l>
     <l n="314">Shade lost in light ; and thus he spake , “ O friends</l>
     <l n="315">That which I have to do I know in part :</l>
     <l n="316">God grant I work my work . That which I am</l>
     <l n="317">He knows Who made me . Saints He hath , good store :</l>
     <l n="318">Their names are written in His Book of Life ;</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="321">Then in a circle kneeling prayed the twelve .</l>
     <l n="322">But when they rose , Secknall with serious brow</l>
     <l n="323">Advanced , and knelt , and kissed Saint Patrick 's foot ,</l>
     <l n="324">And said , “ O Father , at thy hest that hymn</l>
     <l n="325">I made , long labouring , and thy crown it stands :</l>
     <l n="326">Thou , therefore , grant me gifts , for strong thy prayer . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="327">And Patrick said , “ The house wherein thy hymn</l>

     <l n="329">And if men sing it in a house new-built ,</l>
     <l n="330">Where none hath dwelt , nor bridegroom yet , nor bride ,</l>
     <l n="331">Nor hath the cry of babe been heard therein ,</l>
     <l n="332">Upon that house the watching of the Saints</l>
     <l n="333">Of Eire , and Patrick 's watching , shall be fixed</l>
     <l n="334">Even as the stars . ” And Secknall said , “ What more ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="335">Then Patrick added , “ They that night and morn</l>
     <l n="336">Down-lying and up-rising , sing that hymn ,</l>
     <l n="337">They too that softly whisper it , nigh death ,</l>
     <l n="338">If pure of heart , and liegeful unto Christ ,</l>
     <l n="339">Shall see God 's face ; and , since the hymn is long ,</l>
     <l n="340">Its grace shall rest for children and the poor</l>
     <l n="341">Full measure on the last three lines ; and thou</l>
     <l n="342">Of this dear company shalt die the first ,</l>
     <l n="343">And first of Eire 's Apostles . ” Then his cheek</l>
     <l n="344">Secknall laid down once more on Patrick 's foot ,</l>
     <l n="345">And answered , “ Deo Gratias . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="346">Thus in mirth ,</l>

     <l n="354">Yet still with wood-flowers sweet , and scent beside</l>
     <l n="355">Of sod that evening turned . The night came on ;</l>
     <l n="356">A dim ethereal twilight o'er the hills</l>

     <l n="365">Each , the last word : — a pause ; and then , once more ,</l>

    <head>THE STRIVING OF SAINT PATRICK ON MOUNT CRUACHAN .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Saint Patrick , seeing that now Erin believes , desires that the whole land should stand fast in belief till Christ returns to judge the world . For this end he resolves to offer prayer on Mount Cruachan ; but Victor , the Angel who has attended him in all his labours , restrains him from that prayer as being too great . Notwithstanding , the Saint prays three times on the mountain , and three times all the demons of Erin contend against him , and twice Victor , the Angel , rebukes his prayers . In the end Saint Patrick scatters the demons with ignominy , and God 's Angel bids him know that his prayer hath conquered through constancy .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">From realm to realm had Patrick trod the Isle ;</l>
     <l n="2">And evermore God 's work beneath his hand ,</l>
     <l n="3">Since God had blessed that hand , ran out full-sphered ,</l>
     <l n="4">And brighter than a new-created star .</l>
     <l n="5">The Island race , in feud of clan with clan</l>
     <l n="6">Barbaric , gracious else and high of heart ,</l>
     <l n="7">Nor worshippers of self , nor dulled through sense ,</l>
     <l n="8">Beholding , not alone his wondrous works ;</l>
     <l n="9">But , wondrous more , the sweetness of his strength</l>
     <l n="10">And how he neither shrank from flood nor fire ,</l>
     <l n="11">And how he couched him on the wintry rocks ,</l>
     <l n="12">And how he sang great hymns to One who heard ,</l>
     <l n="13">And how he cared for poor men and the sick ,</l>
     <l n="14">And for the souls invisible of men ,</l>
     <l n="15">To him made way — not simple hinds alone ,</l>
     <l n="16">But chiefly wisest heads , for wisdom then</l>
     <l n="17">Prime wisdom saw in Faith ; and , mixt with these ,</l>
     <l n="18">Chieftains and sceptred kings . Nigh Tara , first ,</l>
     <l n="19">Scorning the king 's command , had Patrick lit</l>
     <l n="20">His Paschal fire , and heavenward as it soared ,</l>
     <l n="21">The royal fire and all the Beltaine fires</l>
     <l n="22">Shamed by its beam had withered round the Isle</l>
     <l n="23">Like fires on little hearths whereon the sun</l>
     <l n="24">Looks in his greatness . Later , to that plain</l>
     <l n="25">Central ‘ mid Eire , “ of Adoration ” named ,</l>
     <l n="26">Down-trampled for two thousand years and more</l>
     <l n="27">By erring feet of men , the Saint had sped</l>
     <l n="28">In Apostolic might , and kenned far off</l>
     <l n="29">Ill-pleased , the nation 's idol lifting high</l>
     <l n="30">His head , and those twelve vassal gods around</l>
     <l n="31">All mailed in gold and shining as the sun ,</l>
     <l n="32">A pomp impure . Ill-pleased the Saint had seen them ,</l>
     <l n="33">And raised the Staff of Jesus with a ban :</l>
     <l n="34">Then he , that demon named of men Crom-dubh ,</l>
     <l n="35">With all his vassal gods , into the earth</l>
     <l n="36">That knew her Maker , to their necks had sunk</l>
     <l n="37">While round the island rang three times the cry</l>
     <l n="38">Of fiends tormented .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="39">Not for this as yet</l>
     <l n="40">Had Patrick perfected his strength : as yet</l>
     <l n="41">The depths he had not trodden ; nor had God</l>
     <l n="42">Drawn forth His total forces in the man</l>
     <l n="43">Hidden long since and sealed . For this cause he ,</l>
     <l n="44">Who still his own heart in triumphant hour</l>
     <l n="45">Suspected most , remembering Milchoe 's fate ,</l>
     <l n="46">With fear lest aught of human mar God 's work ,</l>
     <l n="47">And likewise from his handling of the Gael</l>
     <l n="48">Knowing not less their weakness than their strength ,</l>
     <l n="49">Paused on his conquering way , and lonely sat</l>
     <l n="50">In cloud of thought . The great Lent Fast had come :</l>
     <l n="51">Its first three days went by ; the fourth , he rose ,</l>
     <l n="52">And meeting his disciples that drew nigh</l>
     <l n="53">Vouchsafed this greeting only : “ Bide ye here</l>
     <l n="54">Till I return , ” and straightway set his face</l>
     <l n="55">Alone to that great hill “ of eagles ” named</l>
     <l n="56">Huge Cruachan , that o'er the western deep</l>
     <l n="57">Hung through sea-mist , with shadowing crag on crag ,</l>
     <l n="58">High-ridged , and dateless forest long since dead .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="59">That forest reached , the angel of the Lord</l>
     <l n="60">Beside him , as he entered , stood and spake :</l>
     <l n="61">“ The gifts thy soul demands , demand them not ;</l>
     <l n="62">For they are mighty and immeasurable ,</l>
     <l n="63">And over great for granting . ” And the Saint :</l>
     <l n="64">“ This mountain Cruachan I will not leave</l>
     <l n="65">Alive till all be granted , to the last . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="66">Then knelt he on the shrouded mountain 's base ,</l>
     <l n="67">And was in prayer ; and , wrestling with the Lord ,</l>
     <l n="68">Demanded wondrous things immeasurable ,</l>
     <l n="69">Not easy to be granted , for the land ;</l>
     <l n="70">Nor brooked repulse ; and when repulse there came ,</l>
     <l n="71">Repulse that quells the weak and crowns the strong ,</l>
     <l n="72">Forth from its gloom like lightning on him flashed</l>
     <l n="73">Intelligential gleam and insight winged</l>
     <l n="74">That plainlier showed him all his people 's heart ,</l>
     <l n="75">And all the wound thereof : and as in depth</l>
     <l n="76">Knowledge descended , so in height his prayer</l>
     <l n="77">Rose , and far spread ; nor roused alone those Powers</l>
     <l n="78">Regioned with God ; for as the strength of fire</l>
     <l n="79">When flames some palace pile , or city vast ,</l>
     <l n="80">Wakens a tempest round it dragging in</l>
     <l n="81">Wild blast , and from the aggression mightier grows ,</l>
     <l n="82">So wakened Patrick 's prayer the demon race ,</l>
     <l n="83">And drew their legions in upon his soul</l>
     <l n="84">From near and far . First came the Accursed encamped</l>
     <l n="85">On Connact 's cloudy hills and watery moors ;</l>
     <l n="86">Old Umbhall 's Heads , Iorras , and Arran Isle ,</l>
     <l n="87">And where Tyrawley clasps that sea-girt wood</l>
     <l n="88">Fochlut , whence earliest rang the Children 's Cry ,</l>
     <l n="89">To demons trump of doom . In stormy rack</l>
     <l n="90">They came , and hung above the invested Mount</l>
     <l n="91">Expectant . But , their mutterings heeding not ,</l>
     <l n="92">When Patrick still in puissance rose of prayer ,</l>
     <l n="93">O'er all their armies round the realm dispersed</l>
     <l n="94">There ran prescience of fate ; and , north and south ,</l>
     <l n="95">From all the mountain-girdled coasts — for still</l>
     <l n="96">Best site attracts worst Spirit — on they came ,</l>
     <l n="97">From Aileach 's shore and Uladh 's hoary cliffs ,</l>
     <l n="98">Which held the aeries of that eagle race</l>
     <l n="99">More late in Alba throned , “ Lords of the Isles ” -</l>
     <l n="100">High chiefs whose bards , in strong transmitted line ,</l>
     <l n="101">Filled with the name of Fionn , and thine , Oiseen ,</l>
     <l n="102">The blue glens of that never-vanquished land -</l>
     <l n="103">From those purpureal mountains that o'ergaze</l>
     <l n="104">Rock-bowered Loch Lene broidered with sanguine bead ,</l>
     <l n="105">They came , and many a ridge o'er seahYpppHeNlake stretched</l>
     <l n="106">That , autumn-robed in purple and in gold ,</l>
     <l n="107">Pontific vestment , guard the memories still</l>
     <l n="108">Of monks who reared thereon their mystic cells ,</l>
     <l n="109">Finian and Kieran , Fiacre , and Enda 's self</l>
     <l n="110">Of hermits sire , and that sea-facing Saint</l>
     <l n="111">Brendan , who , in his wicker boat of skins</l>
     <l n="112">Before that Genoese a thousand years</l>
     <l n="113">Found a new world ; and many more that now</l>
     <l n="114">Under wind-wasted Cross of Clonmacnoise</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="116">So rushed they on</l>
     <l n="117">From all sides , and , close met , in circling storm</l>
     <l n="118">Besieged the enclouded steep of Cruachan ,</l>
     <l n="119">That scarce the difference knew ‘ twixt night and day</l>
     <l n="120">More than the sunless pole . Him sought they , him</l>
     <l n="121">Whom infinitely near they might approach ,</l>
     <l n="122">Not touch , while firm his faith — their Foe that dragged ,</l>
     <l n="123">Sole-kneeling on that wood-girt mountain 's base ,</l>
     <l n="124">With both hands forth their realm 's foundation stone .</l>
     <l n="125">Thus ruin filled the mountain : day by day</l>
     <l n="126">The forest torment deepened ; louder roared</l>
     <l n="127">The great aisles of the devastated woods ;</l>
     <l n="128">Black cave replied to cave ; and oaks , whole ranks ,</l>
     <l n="129">Colossal growth of immemorial years ,</l>
     <l n="130">Sown ere Milesius landed , or that race</l>
     <l n="131">He vanquished , or that earliest Scythian tribe ,</l>
     <l n="132">Fell in long line , like deep-mined castle wall ,</l>
     <l n="133">At either side God 's warrior . Slowly died</l>
     <l n="134">At last , far echoed in remote ravines ,</l>
     <l n="135">The thunder : then crept forth a little voice</l>
     <l n="136">That shrilly whispered to him thus in scorn :</l>
     <l n="137">“ Two thousand years yon race hath walked in blood</l>
     <l n="138">Neck-deep ; and shall it serve thy Lord of Peace ? ”</l>
     <l n="139">That whisper ceased . Again from all sides burst</l>
     <l n="140">Tenfold the storm ; and as it waxed , the Saint</l>
     <l n="141">Waxed in strong heart ; and , kneeling with stretched hands ,</l>
     <l n="142">Made for himself a panoply of prayer ,</l>
     <l n="143">And wound it round his bosom twice and thrice ,</l>
     <l n="144">And made a sword of comminating psalm ,</l>
     <l n="145">And smote at them that mocked him . Day by day ,</l>
     <l n="146">Till now the second Sunday 's vesper bell</l>
     <l n="147">Gladdened the little churches round the isle ,</l>
     <l n="148">That conflict raged : then , maddening in their ire ,</l>
     <l n="149">Sudden the Princedoms of the Dark , that rode</l>
     <l n="150">This way and that way through the tempest , brake</l>
     <l n="151">Their sceptres , and with one great cry it fell :</l>
     <l n="152">At once o'er all was silence : sunset lit</l>
     <l n="153">The world , that shone as though with face upturned</l>
     <l n="154">It gazed on heavens by angel faces thronged</l>
     <l n="155">And answered light with light . A single bird</l>
     <l n="156">Carolled ; and from the forest skirt down fell ,</l>
     <l n="157">Gem-like , the last drops of the exhausted storm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="158">Then bowed the Saint his forehead to the ground</l>
     <l n="159">Thanking his God ; and there in sacred trance ,</l>
     <l n="160">Which was not sleep , abode not hours alone</l>
     <l n="161">But silent nights and days ; and , ‘ mid that trance ,</l>
     <l n="162">God fed his heart with unseen Sacraments ,</l>
     <l n="163">Immortal food . Awaking , Patrick felt</l>
     <l n="164">Yearnings for nearer commune with his God ,</l>
     <l n="165">Though great its cost ; and gat him on his feet ,</l>
     <l n="166">And , mile by mile , ascended through the woods</l>
     <l n="167">Till stunted were its growths ; and still he clomb</l>
     <l n="168">Printing with sandalled foot the dewy steep :</l>
     <l n="169">But when above the mountain rose the moon</l>
     <l n="170">Brightening each mist , while sank the prone morass</l>
     <l n="171">In double night , he came upon a stone</l>
     <l n="172">Tomb-shaped , that flecked that steep : a little stream</l>
     <l n="173">Dropped by it from the summits to the woods :</l>
     <l n="174">Thereon he knelt ; and was once more in prayer .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="175">Nor prayed unnoticed by that race abhorred .</l>
     <l n="176">No sooner had his knees the mountain touched</l>
     <l n="177">Than through their realm vibration went ; and straight</l>
     <l n="178">His prayer detecting back they trooped in clouds</l>
     <l n="179">And o'er him closed , blotting with bat-like wing</l>
     <l n="180">And inky pall , the moon . Then thunder pealed</l>
     <l n="181">Once more , nor ceased from pealing . Over all</l>
     <l n="182">Night ruled , except when blue and forked flash</l>
     <l n="183">Revealed the on-circling waterspout or plunge</l>
     <l n="184">Of rain beneath the blown cloud 's ravelled hem ,</l>
     <l n="185">Or , huge on high , that lion-coloured steep</l>
     <l n="186">Which , like a lion , roared into the night</l>
     <l n="187">Answering the roaring from sea-caves far down .</l>
     <l n="188">Dire was the strife . That hour the Mountain old ,</l>
     <l n="189">An anarch throned ‘ mid ruins flung himself</l>
     <l n="190">In madness forth on all his winds and floods ,</l>
     <l n="191">An omnipresent wrath ! For God reserved ,</l>
     <l n="192">Too long the prey of demons he had been ;</l>
     <l n="193">Possession foul and fell . Now nigh expelled</l>
     <l n="194">Those demons rent their victim freed . Aloft ,</l>
     <l n="195">They burst the rocky barrier of the tarn</l>
     <l n="196">That downward dashed its countless cataracts ,</l>
     <l n="197">Drowning far vales . On either side the Saint</l>
     <l n="198">A torrent rushed — mightiest of all these twain -</l>
     <l n="199">Peeling the softer substance from the hills</l>
     <l n="200">Their flesh , till glared , deep-trenched , the mountain 's bones ;</l>
     <l n="201">And as those torrents widened , rocks down rolled</l>
     <l n="202">Showering upon that unsubverted head</l>
     <l n="203">Sharp spray ice-cold . Before him closed the flood ,</l>
     <l n="204">And closed behind , till all was raging flood ,</l>
     <l n="205">All but that tomb-like stone whereon he knelt .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="206">Unshaken there he knelt with hands outstretched ,</l>
     <l n="207">God 's Athlete ! For a mighty prize he strove ,</l>
     <l n="208">Nor slacked , nor any whit his forehead bowed :</l>
     <l n="209">Fixed was his eye and keen ; the whole white face</l>
     <l n="210">Keen as that eye itself , though — shapeless yet -</l>
     <l n="211">The infernal horde to ear not eye addressed</l>
     <l n="212">Their battle . Back he drave them , rank on rank ,</l>
     <l n="213">Routed , with psalm , and malison , and ban ,</l>
     <l n="214">As from a sling flung forth . Revolt 's blind spawn</l>
     <l n="215">He named them ; one time Spirits , now linked with brute ,</l>
     <l n="216">Yea , bestial more and baser : and as a ship</l>
     <l n="217">Mounts with the mounting of the wave , so he</l>
     <l n="218">O'er all the insurgent tempest of their wrath</l>
     <l n="219">Rising rode on triumphant . Days went by ,</l>
     <l n="220">Then came a lull ; and lo ! a whisper shrill ,</l>
     <l n="221">Once heard before , again its poison cold</l>
     <l n="222">Distilled : “ Albeit to Christ this land should bow ,</l>
     <l n="223">Some conqueror 's foot one day would quell her Faith . ”</l>
     <l n="224">It ceased . Tenfold once more the storm burst forth :</l>
     <l n="225">Once more the ecstatic passion of his prayer</l>
     <l n="226">Met it , and , breasting , overbore , until</l>
     <l n="227">Sudden the Princedoms of the dark that rode</l>
     <l n="228">This way and that way through the whirlwind , dashed</l>
     <l n="229">Their vanquished crowns of darkness to the ground</l>
     <l n="230">With one long cry . Then silence came ; and lo !</l>
     <l n="231">The white dawn of the fourth fair Day of God</l>
     <l n="232">O'erflowed the world . Slowly the Saint upraised</l>
     <l n="233">His wearied eyes . Upon the mountain lawns</l>
     <l n="234">Lay happy lights ; and birds sang ; and a stream</l>
     <l n="235">That any five-years ’ child might overleap ,</l>
     <l n="236">Beside him lapsed crystalline between banks</l>
     <l n="237">With violets all empurpled , and smooth marge</l>
     <l n="238">Green as that spray which earliest sucks the spring .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="239">Then Patrick raised to God his orison</l>
     <l n="240">On that fair mount , and planted in the grass</l>
     <l n="241">His crozier staff , and slept ; and in his sleep</l>
     <l n="242">God fed his heart with unseen Sacraments ,</l>
     <l n="243">Manna of might divine . Three days he slept ;</l>
     <l n="244">The fourth he woke . Upon his heart there rushed</l>
     <l n="245">Yearning for closer converse with his God</l>
     <l n="246">Though great its cost ; and on his feet he gat ,</l>
     <l n="247">And high , and higher yet , that mountain scaled ,</l>
     <l n="248">And reached at noon the summit . Far below</l>
     <l n="249">Basking the island lay , through rainbow shower</l>
     <l n="250">Gleaming in part , with shadowy moor , and ridge</l>
     <l n="251">Blue in the distance looming . Westward stretched</l>
     <l n="252">A galaxy of isles , and , these beyond ,</l>
     <l n="253">Infinite sea with sacred light ablaze ,</l>
     <l n="254">And high o'erhead there hung a cloudless heaven .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="255">Upon that summit kneeling , face to sea</l>
     <l n="256">The Saint , with hands held forth and thanks returned ,</l>
     <l n="257">Claimed as his stately heritage that realm</l>
     <l n="258">From north to south : but instant as his lip</l>
     <l n="259">Printed with earliest pulse of Christian prayer</l>
     <l n="260">That clear aerial clime Pagan till then ;</l>
     <l n="261">The Host Accursed , sagacious of his act ,</l>
     <l n="262">Rushed back from all the isle and round him met</l>
     <l n="263">With anger seven times heated , since their hour ,</l>
     <l n="264">And this they knew , was come . Nor thunder din</l>
     <l n="265">And challenge through the ear alone , sufficed</l>
     <l n="266">That hour their rage malign that , craving sore</l>
     <l n="267">Material bulk to rend his bulk — their foe 's -</l>
     <l n="268">Through fleshly strength of that their murder-lust</l>
     <l n="269">Flamed forth in fleshly form phantoms night-black</l>
     <l n="270">Though bodiless yet to bodied mass as nigh</l>
     <l n="271">As Spirits can reach . More thick than vultures winged</l>
     <l n="272">To fields with carnage piled , the Accursed thronged</l>
     <l n="273">Making thick night which neither earth nor sky</l>
     <l n="274">Could pierce , from sense expunged . In phalanx now ,</l>
     <l n="275">Anon in breaking legion , or in globe ,</l>
     <l n="276">With clang of iron pinion on they rushed</l>
     <l n="277">And spectral dart high-held . Nor quailed the Saint ,</l>
     <l n="278">Contending for his people on that Mount ,</l>
     <l n="279">Nor spared God 's foes ; for as old minster towers</l>
     <l n="280">Besieged by midnight storm send forth reply</l>
     <l n="281">In storm outrolled of bells , so sent he forth</l>
     <l n="282">Defiance from fierce lip , vindictive chaunt ,</l>
     <l n="283">And blight and ban , and maledictive rite</l>
     <l n="284">Potent on face of Spirits impure to raise</l>
     <l n="285">These plague-spots three , Defeat , Madness , Despair ;</l>
     <l n="286">Nor stinted flail of taunt — “ When first my bark</l>
     <l n="287">Threatened your coasts , as now upon the hills</l>
     <l n="288">Hung ye in cloud ; as now , I raised this Cross ;</l>
     <l n="289">Ye fled before it and again shall fly ! ”</l>
     <l n="290">So hurled he back their squadrons . Day by day</l>
     <l n="291">The hurricanes of war shook earth and heaven :</l>
     <l n="292">Till now , on Holy Saturday , that hour</l>
     <l n="293">Returned which maketh glad the Church of God</l>
     <l n="294">When over Christendom in widowed fanes</l>
     <l n="295">Two days by penance stripped , and dumb as though</l>
     <l n="296">Some Antichrist had trodd'n them down , once more</l>
     <l n="297">Swells forth amid the new-lit paschal lights</l>
     <l n="298">The “ Gloria in Excelsis : ” sudden then</l>
     <l n="299">That mighty conflict ceased , save one low voice</l>
     <l n="300">Twice heard before , now edged with bitterer scoff ,</l>
     <l n="301">“ That race thou lov'st , though fierce in wrath , is soft :</l>
     <l n="302">Plenty and peace will melt their Faith one day : ”</l>
     <l n="303">Then with that whisper dying , died the night :</l>
     <l n="304">Then forth from darkness issued earth and sky :</l>
     <l n="305">Then fled the phantoms far o'er ocean 's wave ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="307">But he , their conqueror wept , upon that height</l>

     <l n="310">Nor of that heaven relit ; so worked that scoff</l>
     <l n="311">Winged from the abyss ; and ever thus the man</l>
     <l n="312">With darkness communed and that poison cold :</l>
     <l n="313">“ If Faith indeed should flood the land with peace ,</l>

     <l n="319">The whole heart of the man was turned to tears ,</l>
     <l n="320">A fount of bale and chalice brimmed with death -</l>
     <l n="321">For oft a thought chance-born more racks than truth</l>
     <l n="322">Proven and sure — and , weeping , still he wept</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="326">As thus he wept</l>
     <l n="327">Sudden beside him on that summit broad ,</l>

     <l n="329">Gilding the sea : and , turning , by his side</l>
     <l n="330">Victor , God 's angel , stood with lustrous brow</l>

     <l n="332">He , putting forth his hand , with living coal</l>
     <l n="333">Snatched from God 's altar , made that dripping cowl</l>
     <l n="334">Dry as an Autumn sheaf . The angel spake :</l>

     <l n="338">Cresting high rock , and ridge , and airy peak ,</l>
     <l n="339">Innumerable the Sons of God all round</l>
     <l n="340">Vested the invisible mountain with white light ,</l>

     <l n="347">They sang to soothe the vexed heart of the Saint -</l>
     <l n="348">Love-song of Heaven : and slowly as it died</l>
     <l n="349">Their splendours waned ; and through that vanishing light</l>

     <l n="351">To Patrick then ,</l>

     <l n="357">One said , ‘ Too fierce that race to bend to faith . ’ ”</l>
     <l n="358">Then spake God 's angel , mild of voice , and kind :</l>
     <l n="359">“ Not all are fierce that fiercest seem , for oft</l>

     <l n="367">From Cruachan , for mighty is thy prayer . ”</l>
     <l n="368">And Patrick made reply : “ Not great thy boon !</l>

     <l n="376">One said , ‘ Although that People should believe</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="393">Then answer made the angel , soft of voice :</l>

    <head>EPILOGUE .</head>
    <head>THE CONFESSION OF SAINT PATRICK .</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Before his death , Saint Patrick makes confession to his brethren concerning his life ; of his love for that land which had been his House of Bondage ; of his ceaseless prayer in youth : of his sojourn at Tours , where St. Martin had made abode , at Auxerres with St. Germanus , and at Lerins with the Contemplatives : of that mystic mountain where the Redeemer Himself lodged the Crozier Staff in his hand ; of Pope Celestine who gave him his Mission ; of his Visions ; of his Labours . His last charge to the sons of Erin is that they should walk in Truth ; that they should put from them the spirit of Revenge ; and that they should hold fast to the Faith of Christ .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">At Saul then , by the inland-spreading sea ,</l>
     <l n="2">There where began my labour , comes the end :</l>
     <l n="3">I , blind and witless , willed it otherwise :</l>
     <l n="4">God willed it thus . When prescience came of death</l>
     <l n="5">I said , “ My Resurrection place I choose ” -</l>
     <l n="6">O fool , for ne'er since boyhood choice was mine</l>
     <l n="7">Save choice to subject will of mine to God -</l>
     <l n="8">“ At great Ardmacha . ” Thitherward I turned ;</l>
     <l n="9">But in my pathway , with forbidding hand ,</l>
     <l n="10">Victor , God 's angel stood . “ Not so , ” he said ,</l>
     <l n="11">“ For in Ardmacha stands thy princedom fixed ,</l>
     <l n="12">Age after age , thy teaching , and thy law ,</l>
     <l n="13">But not thy grave . Return thou to that shore</l>
     <l n="14">Thy place of small beginnings , and thereon</l>
     <l n="15">Lessen in body and mind , and grow in spirit :</l>
     <l n="16">Then sing to God thy little hymn and die . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="17">Yea , Lord , my mouth would praise Thee ere I die ,</l>
     <l n="18">The Father , and the Son , and Holy Spirit</l>

     <l n="28">Are Christ 's Epistle , borne to ends of earth ,</l>
     <l n="29">Writ by His Spirit , and plain to souls elect : ”</l>

     <l n="31">Yea , by abjection Thine , by suffering Thine !</l>

     <l n="34">Slid under me in might , and lifted me ,</l>
     <l n="35">And fixed me in Thy Temple where Thou wouldst .</l>
     <l n="36">Wonder , ye great ones , wonder , ye the wise !</l>
     <l n="37">On me , the last and least , this charge was laid</l>
     <l n="38">This crown , that I in humbleness and truth</l>
     <l n="39">Should walk this nation 's Servant till I die .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="40">Therefore , a youth of sixteen years , or less ,</l>
     <l n="41">With others of my land by pirates seized</l>
     <l n="42">I stood on Erin 's shore . Our bonds were just ;</l>
     <l n="43">Our God we had forsaken , and His Law ,</l>
     <l n="44">And mocked His priests . Tending a stern man 's swine</l>
     <l n="45">I trod those Dalaraida hills that face</l>
     <l n="46">Eastward to Alba . Six long years went by ;</l>
     <l n="47">But — sent from God — Memory , and Faith , and Fear</l>
     <l n="48">Moved on my spirit as winds upon the sea ,</l>
     <l n="49">And the Spirit of Prayer came down . Full many a day</l>
     <l n="50">Climbing the mountain tops , one hundred times</l>
     <l n="51">I flung upon the storm my cry to God .</l>
     <l n="52">Nor frost , nor rain might harm me , for His love</l>
     <l n="53">Burned in my heart . Through love I made my fast ;</l>
     <l n="54">And in my fasts one night I heard this voice ,</l>
     <l n="55">“ Thou fastest well : soon shalt thou see thy Land . ”</l>
     <l n="56">Later , once more thus spake it : “ Southward fly ,</l>
     <l n="57">Thy ship awaits thee . ” Many a day I fled ,</l>
     <l n="58">And found the black ship dropping down the tide ,</l>
     <l n="59">And entered with those Gentiles by Thy grace</l>
     <l n="60">Vanquished , though first they spurned me , and was free .</l>
     <l n="61">It was Thy leading , Lord ; the Hand was Thine !</l>
     <l n="62">For now when , perils past , I walked secure ,</l>
     <l n="63">Kind greetings round me , and the Christian Rite ,</l>
     <l n="64">There rose a clamorous yearning in my heart ,</l>
     <l n="65">And memories of that land so far , so fair ,</l>
     <l n="66">And lost in such a gloom . And through that gloom</l>
     <l n="67">The eyes of little children shone on me ,</l>
     <l n="68">So ready to believe ! Such children oft</l>
     <l n="69">Ran by me naked in and out the waves ,</l>
     <l n="70">Or danced in circles upon Erin 's shores ,</l>
     <l n="71">Like creatures never fallen ! Thought of such</l>
     <l n="72">Passed into thought of others . From my youth</l>
     <l n="73">Both men and women , maidens most , to me</l>
     <l n="74">As children seemed ; and O the pity then</l>
     <l n="75">To mark how oft they wept , how seldom knew</l>
     <l n="76">Whence came the wound that galled them ! As I walked ,</l>
     <l n="77">Each wind that passed me whispered , “ Lo , that race</l>
     <l n="78">Which trod thee down ! Requite with good their ill !</l>
     <l n="79">Thou know'st their tongue ; old man to thee , and youth ,</l>
     <l n="80">For counsel came , and lambs would lick thy foot ;</l>
     <l n="81">And now the whole land is a sheep astray</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="83">Alone one night I mused ,</l>

     <l n="86">Satan my soul plagued with temptation dire .</l>

     <l n="90">O'er me it blackened . Sudden from my heart</l>
     <l n="91">This thought leaped forth : “ Elias ! Him invoke ! ”</l>
     <l n="92">That name invoked , vanished the rock ; and I ,</l>
     <l n="93">On mountains stood watching the rising sun ,</l>
     <l n="94">As stood Elias once on Carmel 's crest ,</l>
     <l n="95">Gazing on heaven unbarred , and that white cloud ,</l>

     <l n="97">Might Divine !</l>

     <l n="101">Martin had ruled , my kinsman in the flesh .</l>
     <l n="102">Dead was the lion ; but his lair was warm :</l>
     <l n="103">In it I laid me , and a conquering glow</l>
     <l n="104">Rushed up into my heart . I heard discourse</l>
     <l n="105">Of Martin still , his valour in the Lord ,</l>
     <l n="106">His rugged warrior zeal , his passionate love</l>
     <l n="107">For Hilary , his vigils , and his fasts ,</l>
     <l n="108">And all his pitiless warfare on the Powers</l>
     <l n="109">Of darkness ; and one day , in secrecy ,</l>
     <l n="110">With Ninian , missioned then to Alba 's shore ,</l>
     <l n="111">I peered into his branch-enwoven cell ,</l>
     <l n="112">Half-way between the river and the rocks ,</l>
     <l n="113">From Tours a mile and more .</l>

     <l n="114">So passed eight years</l>

     <l n="120">And to that Saint was subject fourteen years .</l>
     <l n="121">He from my mind removed the veil ; “ Lift up , ”</l>

     <l n="470">How perilous is the path of great attempts ,</l>
     <l n="471">How oft pride meets us on the storm-vexed height ,</l>

     <l n="475">How still this eve ! The morn was racked with storm :</l>
     <l n="476">‘ Tis past ; the skylark sings ; the tide at flood</l>
     <l n="477">Sighs a soft joy : alone those lines of weed</l>
     <l n="478">Report the wrath foregone . Yon watery plain</l>
     <l n="479">Far shines , a mingled sea of glass and fire ,</l>
     <l n="480">Even as that Beatific Sea outspread</l>
     <l n="481">Before the Throne of God . ‘ Tis Paschal Tide ; -</l>

     <l n="483">Fain would I die on Holy Saturday ;</l>
     <l n="484">For then , as now , the storm is past — the woe ;</l>
     <l n="485">And , somewhere ‘ mid the shades of Olivet</l>
     <l n="486">Lies sealed the sacred cave of that Repose</l>
     <l n="487">Watched by the Holy Women . Earth , that sing'st ,</l>

     <l n="492">Man , too , Thou mad'st ; within Thy Hands the life</l>
     <l n="493">Of each was shapen , and new-wov'n ran out ,</l>
     <l n="494">New-willed each moment . What makes up that life ?</l>
     <l n="495">Love infinite , and nothing else save love !</l>
     <l n="496">Help ere need came , deliverance ere defeat ;</l>
     <l n="497">At every step an angel to sustain us ,</l>
     <l n="498">An angel to retrieve ! My years are gone :</l>

     <l n="500">Till now ;— not half discerned . Those blessed years</l>
     <l n="501">I would re-live , deferring thus so long</l>
     <l n="502">The Vision of Thy Face , if thus with gaze</l>
     <l n="503">Cast backward I might SEE that guiding hand</l>
     <l n="504">Step after step , and kiss it .</l>
