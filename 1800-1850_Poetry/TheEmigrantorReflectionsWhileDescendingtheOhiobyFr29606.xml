    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">This POEM was written under the circumstances which its title implies . Three years since , as the author was descending the Ohio , to become a citizen of the West , he wrote a considerable number of stanzas , expressive of his feelings , six or eight of which were published as a fragment on his arrival in Cincinnati , in the Commercial Daily Advertiser , and republished and noticed by different prints in a way that induced the author , from time to time , to add stanzas to stanzas , until they almost imperceptibly reached their present number . He wrote on , without any previous study of the style or manner in which the subject should be pursued — using the poetic license of light and shade as Fancy dictated . Being in ill health , and coming to a strange land , it was very natural for his Reflections to be of a sombre cast , without there being any thing peculiar in his situation differing from that of other Emigrants .</p>
    <p n="2">The reader will perceive that the metrical arrangement of the stanzas is the same as that used by Gray , in his Ode to Adversity , with this difference , that the Ode is written in lines of eight syllables , and the author has attempted the heroic measure .</p>
    <p n="3">After the POEM had been finished some time , the author delivered it in the Hall of the Lyceum to an assemblage of Ladies and Gentlemen . Their reception and that of the several editors ( to whom he is most grateful ) who noticed its delivery , and gave extracts from the POEM , induced him to publish it .</p>
    <p n="4">The author has by him many manuscript pieces with which he might have swelled the volume to a much greater size ; but as this is his first attempt at authorship , in the shape of a volume , he offers it , tremblingly , at the ordeal of public opinion , merely as a sample of his ware .</p>

   <head>DEDICATION .</head>
   <head>TO CHARLES HAMMOND , ESQ .</head>
   <head>MY DEAR SIR ,</head>
   <p>Before I had the pleasure of your personal acquaintance , differing from you as I do on many political points , I imbibed some of those impressions against you , which ever attach to an exalted character , when he takes a decided stand in the political arena .</p>
   <p>Permit me , Sir , in acknowledging how much those impressions were prejudices , to inscribe this volume to you , in testimony of my admiration for your talents , and respect for your virtues . And , moreover , as the first encouragement which I received , for this my first literary attempt of any length , proceeded from yourself ; if it has merit , I know no one to whom I should more properly inscribe it than to the one , who being entitled to speak ex cathedra on the subject , first cheered me with the hope of its success . And if it shall be found to be destitute of merit , while it shows that your judgment has for once been wrong , it will also prove that the error proceeded from a personal partiality , for which I am anxious to express my gratitude .</p>
   <p>I am , Sir , With the greatest respect , Your obliged friend and humble servant , THE AUTHOR .</p>
   <p>CINCINNATI , April 23 , 1833 .</p>
   <p>MEMOIR .</p>
   <p>Frederick William Thomas was the oldest child of E. S. Thomas and Anna his wife . He was born at Providence Rhode Island , but spent his earlier years at Charleston South Carolina , where Mr. E. S. Thomas resided and edited and published the Charleston City Gazette .</p>
   <p>While Frederick William was still young , Mr. Thomas removed to Baltimore Maryland , and there his son was educated and brought up to the profession of the law . Being unfortunate in business , when Frederick William was about nineteen , Mr. Thomas resolved to remove with his family to the west , which he did , making Cincinnati his place of residence . His son however , remained in Baltimore .</p>
   <p>It was in the following year while journeying West , to join his family in their new home , that this poem — the Emigrant was suggested to him , by the associations and the romantic scenery of the Ohio river , and while descending it most , if not all the poem , was written . He was about twenty-one when it appeared . It was followed by “ Clinton Bradshaw , ” or the adventures of a Lawyer , published by Carey , Lee and Blanchard , of Philadelphia . This was called the best American Novel of its time . Mr. Thomas ’ next venture was “ East and West ” which was succeeded by “ Howard Pinkney . ” During the years which intervened between the writing of these books he resided in the west , principally in Cincinnati , and wrote tales , sketches , fugitive poetry , delivered lectures , and made political speeches . In 1840 when General Harrison was elected President , Mr. Thomas went to Washington City . After General Harrison 's death , Mr. Tyler gave him an office under government and he continued to reside at the Capital , but wrote little except an occasional song or story . Some years elapsed and Mr. Thomas left Washington and went south on a lecturing tour . He was engaged to write for several newspapers and continued lecturing through the South and West . His literary efforts at this period were chiefly confined to Magazine articles , short poems and songs . His song “ T'is said that Absence conquers Love , ” was one of the most popular of the day . He often spoke of the feeling he had in passing of a summers night through a strange city and having his own words greet him from houses whose inmates only knew of his existence through them .</p>
   <p>Clinton Bradshaw was also very popular . An American visiting Calcutta India , wrote home of the thrill it gave him to find it on the shelves of a book store there .</p>
   <p>Mr. Thomas was popular in society for he was amiable and entertaining . He was a fine belle letter scholar , and was remarkable for his conversationable powers — he had a fund of anecdote always at command . He was a great observer and studier of Character and a believer in human nature .</p>
   <p>The year 1866 found him again in Washington city where after a short illness he died . Recently his remains have been brought to Cincinnati , by his brother Calvin W. Thomas and placed beside those of his parents in Spring Grove Cemetery .</p>
   <p>The Emigrant ,</p>
   <p>OR REFLECTIONS<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>WHILE DESCENDING THE OHIO .</p>
   <p>I . We both are pilgrims , wild and winding river ! Both wandering onward to the boundless West — But thou art given by the good All-giver , Blessing a land to be in turn most blest :[ 2 ] While , like a leaf-borne insect , floating by , Chanceful and changeful is my destiny ; I needs must follow where thy currents lave — Perchance to find a home , or else , perchance a grave .</p>
   <p>II . Yet , dost thou bear me on to one I 've loved From Boyhood 's thoughtlessness to Manhood 's thought , In all the changes of our lives , unmoved — That young affection no regret has brought : Beloved one ! when I seem Fortune 's slave , Reckless and wrecked upon the wayward wave , Bright Hope , the Halcyon , rises o'er the sea , Calming the troubled wave — bearing my heart to thee .</p>
   <p>III . Alas ! we parted : what a bitter sorrow Clings to the memory of our last embrace ! No joy to-day , no promise of to-morrow , No idol image , shall usurp thy place : For thee my holiest hope is upward given — My love for thee is with my love for Heav'n , A dedication of my heart to thine , With God to smile on both , and consecrate the shrine .</p>
   <p>IV . Our home , when last I saw it , was all lone ; Yet my affections peopled it with those Whose sunny smile upon my boyhood shone ; Then came reality ,— the heart-spring froze :— There was the stream , the willow , and the wild wood , Where , emulous of height , in playing childhood , With hearts encircled , on the beechen tree , Dear one , I carved thy name , but then thou wert with me .</p>
   <p>V. Thou wert my nurse in many an hour of pain , My comforter in many an hour of sadness ; And when my spirit leaped to joy again , Thou wert the one who joyed most in its gladness . Ay , more than nurse — and more than comforter — Thou taught'st my erring spirit not to err , Gave it a softness nature had not given , As now the blessed moon makes earth resemble heav'n .</p>
   <p>VI . How deep the bitterness alone to grieve In grief 's deep hour — the death-watch of the night — When Fancy can no more her day dreams weave , And there seems madness in the moon 's pale light — When sorrow holds us , like a life-long state , Not as a portion , but the whole of fate , When the mind yields , like sick men to their dreams , Who know all is not right , yet know not that which seems .</p>
   <p>VII . Why come such thoughts across the brow ? Oh , why Cannot the soul sit firmly on her throne , And keep beside her strong Philosophy ? Alas ! I am a wanderer and alone . Beneath deep feeling reason 's self must sink ; We cannot change the thought , yet we must think ; And , O ! how darkly come such thoughts to me — The gathered pangs of years , recounting agony .</p>
   <p>VIII . Who has not felt , in such a night as this , The glory and the greatness of a God , And bowed his head , in humbleness , to kiss His merciful and kindly chast'ning rod ? The far off stars ! how beautiful and bright ! Peace seems abroad upon the world to-night ; And e'en the bubble , dancing on the stream , Is glittering with hope ,— a dream — a very dream !</p>
   <p>IX . In sickness and in sorrow , how the breast Will garner its affections in their home ! Like stricken bird that cowers within its nest , And feels no more an anxiousness to roam ; While a thick darkness , like a cloud , comes o'er The gallant spirit ;— it can rise no more To wing its way , as if it sought the sky , But falls to earth , forlorn , as though it fell to die .</p>
   <p>X . And yet , there is a torturing sense of life , E'en in the feeling of the quick drawn breath , That tells of many years of woe and strife , Ekeing our being out , though bringing death : While Fancy , with a thousand thronging tales , Now in her gladness , now in woe , prevails ,— Till the dark moment of o'erwhelming grief , When sorrow mourns as one who cannot find relief .</p>
   <p>XI . Is health returnless ? Never more may I Throw by the staff on which , alas ! I lean ? Is the woof woven of my destiny ? Shall I ne'er be again what I have been ? And must th ’ bodily anguish be combined With the intenseness of the anxious mind ? The fever of the fame and of the soul , With no medicinal draught to quell it or control .</p>
   <p>XII . Upon my brow I feel the furrow 's course , Deep sinking inward to the source of thought ; The deeper sinking if I seek its source , Or try to crush its agony , unsought , O ! tell thy secret , thou stern vampyre , Care ! E'en for Philosophy thou hast a snare , For in thy quest she wears the galling chain , Making the burden more , the more she 'd soothe its pain .</p>
   <p>XIII . Sweet solace of the life-lorn ! HOPE ! to thee How oft in loneliness the heart will turn , To quell the pang of its keen misery ; While wailing sorrow weeps o'er memory 's urn : Rise from the ashes of my buried years ! The past comes up with overflowing tears , To quench the promises that would arise :— They 're in the future far — where are they ?— in the skies !</p>
   <p>XIV . My hopes , e'en my hopes , wither ; a dark cloud Has passed between them and the glorious sun , Clothing the breathing being in a shroud — The pall is o'er them and their race is run : Their epitaph is written in my heart — The all of mem'ry that can ne'er depart — Yes , it is here ! the truth of every dream , The ever-present thought , in every varying theme .</p>
   <p>XV . O ! who can pierce the cloud that o'er him lowers ? It were as vain my wayward fate to scan ; Enough , ‘ twill come with th ’ onhurrying hours — The futile purpose or the settled plan : Or Death , perchance , e'en now each tie may sever ! There 's many a grave in this bright rolling river , That 's bounding onward where the one I love , To meet my coming , now , on its far banks may rove .</p>
   <p>XVI . And , but that thou would'st feel a pang for me , ‘ Twere sweet , methinks , to sleep beneath the wave ; Its murmuring song , like sweetest minstrelsy , Would rest a wanderer in an early grave , Within thee , River , many a pale face sleeps — And many a redman 's ghost his vigil keeps — And many a maid has watched the dark banks over — He comes not , yet , in truth , he was a faithful lover .</p>
   <p>XVII . For then , perchance , thy stream ran red with blood , Then pale and red men met upon thy shore — Embracing foes they sunk within the flood , Fierce twins in death , and joined forevermore ,— Forevermore in time . Eternity ! Thy doom we see not , and we may not see , But God is just ! to Him the red race fly , Driv'n to the pathless West , thence upward to the sky .</p>
   <p>XVIII . Here once Boone trod — the hardy Pioneer — The only white man in the wilderness :[ 3 ] Oh ! how he loved , alone , to hunt the deer , Alone , at eve , his simple meal to dress ; No mark upon the tree , nor print , nor track , To lead him forward , or to guide him back ; He roved the forest , king by main and might , And looked up to the sky and shaped his course aright .</p>
   <p>XIX . That mountain , there , that lifts its bald high head Above the forest , was , perchance , his throne ; There has he stood and marked the woods outspread , Like a great kingdom , that was all his own ; In hunting shirt and moccassins arrayed , With bear skin cap , and pouch , and needful blade , How carelessly he leaned upon his gun ! That sceptre of the wild , that had so often won .</p>
   <p>XX . Those western Pioneers an impulse felt . Which their less hardy sons scarce comprehend ; Alone , in Nature 's wildest scenes , they dwelt , Where crag , and precipice , and torrent blend , And stretched around the wilderness , as rude As the red rovers of its solitude , Who watched their coming with a hate profound , And fought with deadly strife for every inch of ground .</p>
   <p>XXI . To shun a greater ill sought they the wild ? No ! they left happier lands behind them far , And brought the nursing mother and her child To share the dangers of the border war ; The log-built cabin from the Indian barred , Their little boy , perchance , kept watch and ward , While Father ploughed with rifle at his back , Or sought the glutted foe through many a devious track .</p>
   <p>XXII . How cautiously , yet fearlessly , that boy Would search the forest for the wild beast 's lair , And lift his rifle with a hurried joy If chance he spied the Indian lurking there : And should they bear him prisoner from the fight , While they are sleeping in the dead midnight , He slips the thongs that bind him to the tree , And leaving death with them , bounds home right happily .<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span></p>
   <p>XXIII . Before the mother , bursting through the door , The redman rushes where her infants rest ; Oh God ! he hurls them on the cabin floor ! While she , down kneeling , clasps them to her breast . How he exults and revels in her woe , And lifts the weapon , yet delays the blow : Ha ! that report ! behold ! he reels ! he dies ! And quickly to her arms the husband — father — flies .</p>
   <p>XXIV . In the long winter eve , their cabin fast , The big logs blazing in the chimney wide — They 'd hear the Indian howling , or the blast , And deem themselves in castellated pride : Then would the fearless forester disclose Most strange adventures with his sylvan foes , Of how his arts did over theirs prevail , And how he followed far upon their bloody trail .</p>
   <p>XXV . And it was happiness , they said , to stand , When summer smiled upon them in the wood , And see their little clearing there expand , And be the masters of the solitude . Danger was but excitement ; and when came The tide of Emigration , life grew tame ; Then would they seek some unknown wild anew , And soon , above the trees , the smoke was curling blue .</p>
   <p>XXVI . Long e'er the pale-face knew them , or their land , Here , too , the redmen met in the stern strife Of foe to foe and bloody hand to hand — The mortal agony of life for life : How fertile is this “ dark and bloody ground ! ” Here Death has given many a horrid wound !<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>Here was the victim tortured to the stake , While dark Revenge stood by , his burning thirst to slake .</p>
   <p>XXVII . Methinks I see it all within yon dell , Where trembles thro ’ the leaves the clear moonlight ; Say , Druid Oak , can'st not the story tell ? Why met they thus ? and wherefore did they fight ? And wept his maiden much ? and who was he , Who thus so calmly bore his agony ? Sang he his death song well ? was he a chief ? And mourned his nation long in notes of lengthened grief ?</p>
   <p>XXVIII . Here , from the woods , he came to woo his mate , And launched , to meet her , his bark-built canoe : Who would have thought he had a soul to hate To see him thus , all gentleness to woo ? In tenderest tone he tells his deeds of war , With blandest feeling shows the ghastly scar He joyed to take , that he might win his bride , His own , his blushing one — the dark-eyed by his side .</p>
   <p>XXIX . Again he goes — again she looks for him — At the death-stake her warrior-love is tied : Say , when he thought of her , did the tear swim ? Shook , for an instant , that bold Indian 's pride ? No ! when he thought of her , it was to nerve A soul whose purpose knew not how to swerve ! For this she loves him , holds him doubly dear ; He knows what ‘ tis to love , but not what ‘ tis to fear .</p>
   <p>XXX . O , Love what rhymer has not sung of thee ? And , who , with heart so young as his who sings , Knows not thou art self-burdened as the bee , Who , loving many flowers , must needs have wings ? Yes , thou art wing 'd , O , Love ! like passing thought , That now is with us , and now seems as nought , Until deep passion stamps thee in the brain , Like bees in folded flowers that ne'er unfold again .</p>
   <p>XXXI . Who does not love his early dream of love ?— The passionate fondness of the happy boy , When woman 's lightest look the pulse would move To the wild riot of extatic joy ; The tremulous whisper , mingling hopes and fears , Her very presence , that so long endears The spot , on which the mutual vow was giv'n , The interchange of love , and the on-looking Heav'n .</p>
   <p>XXXII . This is the tale that never tires in telling — If woman listens as ye tell the tale : And then , to mark her gentle bosom swelling , And feel the fervor of your faith prevail ! Her tone , the confidence of her bright eye , That looks to yours its eloquent reply ! And then , her seeming doubt — spoke you in vain ? O ! no ! she only doubts to hear you speak again !</p>
   <p>XXXIII . My Mary ! though I yet am young in years , ‘ Tis like a dream , Love , of the olden time , When first they coyness yielded up its fears , And thy warm heart throbb 'd tremblingly to mine ,— When we exchanged the faith we loved to make , And made the promise it should never break — How happy , then , the future rose to view — Our hearts the auguries that made it seem all true .</p>
   <p>XXXIV . A sense of coldness , like the atmosphere , When chilled by the rude winter 's snowy blast , Has passed between us now : and — lone and sear , Like the last autumn leaf that fell at last , Though on its parent stem it fain would stay , With days , perchance , as bright as yesterday — Our hopes have fallen — yet , my Mary , yet , There is no lethean power can teach me to forget .</p>
   <p>XXXV . For , in that young affection 's early dream , There was the presence and the soul of joy , Which , like the stars , though clouds obscure them , beam With hues of Heav'n , that earth cannot destroy : Dark desolation may be o'er our path , And the fierce lightnings rive it in their wrath , And scalding tears may weep their sources dry , Yet , will that love live on , on its own agony .</p>
   <p>XXXVI . E'en like — if we its hopes may personate — Fall'n Marius , ‘ mid the ruins , when he stood And pondered darkly o'er his desperate fate , Alone , in th ’ o'erthrown City 's solitude . Oh ! we may build a fairy home for love — But , when ‘ tis blasted , how can we remove ? How from the ruins can the ruined part ? Or how rebuild the hope that , falling , crushed the heart .</p>
   <p>XXXVII . And , mused I now , as that stern exile mused , ‘ Mid fallen columns , cities overthrown , With Desolation all around diffused , I should seem less than I seem now alone — For it would be companionship ; but here There is no sympathy with mortal tear : The skies are smiling , and the forests rise In their green glory up , aspirers to the skies !—</p>
   <p>XXXVIII . And the wild river , laughing , laves its banks — A babbler — like a happy-hearted girl , Dancing along with free and frolic pranks ; The leaves , o'erhanging , tremble like the curl That plays upon her forehead as she goes — While ‘ mid the branches , free from human woes , The wild bird carols to its happy mate , Glad in the present hour , nor anxious for its fate .</p>
   <p>XXXIX . But there is one tree blasted ‘ mid the green , Surrounding forest ; and an eagle , there , Looks sadly o'er the gaily , glitt'ring scene , A mourner — with his bleeding bosom bare :— No more ! no more ! he 'll reach his eyry now , Or sport in triumph o'er the mountain 's brow ; His wing may hide the death-bolt as he dies , No more shall it expand to bear him to the skies .</p>
   <p>XL . How like the balmy breathing of the spring , Is the unfolding of Love 's happy morn ! Then our nurst hopes , anticipating , bring The May-day breaking , that shall bear no thorn : The thorn must have its birth-day with the rose — When one is blighted , still the other grows , And grows the keener , as the seared leaves fall , And rankles in the heart when the storm scatters all .</p>
   <p>XLI . Be blessings on thee , Lady of my love ! As many blessings as thou did'st impart , When to my breast thou cam'st like a young dove , And made thy home in my all-happy heart . Like the loved picture of his buried maid , Which the sad lover keeps , and weeps the shade , So Memory , to my early feelings true , Preserves its passionate love in bidding hope adieu !</p>
   <p>XLII . No ! “ while there 's life there 's hope , ” at least , in love ; Hope that the two shall not be always twain :— Will it not find its home — that parted dove — Though severed far o'er mountain and o'er main ? Though night o'ertake it , though the tempests rise , Alike , through cloudy , and through smiling skies , Onward it hastens ; and , with panting breast , Nestles at home at last , and loves the more its nest .</p>
   <p>XLIII . Built o'er the Indian 's grave , the city , here , To all the pomp of civic pride is giv'n , While o'er the spot there falls no tribute-tear , Not e'en his kindred drop — the dew of Heav'n . How touching was the chieftain 's homily ! That none would mourn for him when he should die ; Soon shall the race of their last man be run — Then who will mourn for them ? Alas ! not one — not one !</p>
   <p>XLIV . They all have passed away , as thou must pass , Who now art wandering westward where they trod — An atom in the mighty human mass , Who live and die . No more . The grave-green sod , Can but be made the greener o'er the best , A flattering epitaph may tell the rest — While they who come , as come these onward waves , Forget who sleep below , and trample on their graves .</p>
   <p>XLV . Yet , who , that ever trod upon this shore , Since the rude red man left it to his tread , Thinks not of him , and marks not , o'er and o'er , The contrast of the living with the dead ? There the tall forest falls — that Indian mound Will soon be levelled with the ploughed-up ground — Where stands that village church , traditions hold , The war-whoop once rang loud o'er many a warrior cold .</p>
   <p>XLVI . Where stole the paddle-plied and tottering bark Along the rough shores cragg 'd and sedgy side ,— Where the fierce hunter , from the forest dark , Pursued the wild deer o'er the mountains wild ,— Now towering cities rise on either hand , And Commerce hastens by to many a strand , Not on her white wings , as upon the sea — Yet borne as bravely on , and spreading liberty .</p>
   <p>XLVII . And here , where once the Indian mother dwelt , Cradling her infant on the blast-rocked tree , Feeling the vengeance that her warrior felt , And teaching war to childhood on her knee — Now dwells the christian mother : O ! her heart Has learned far better the maternal part — Yet , in deep love , in passion for her child , Who has surpass 'd thine own , wild woman of the wild ?</p>
   <p>XLVIII . Our homes , and hearts , and Nature , the blue sky , Breathe these affections into all who live — The flowings of their fountains cannot dry . Who gave us life ? ‘ Tis He , who bids them live ! And they have lived , here , in this forest-bower , In all the strength , the constancy , the power , The deep devotion , the unchanging truth Of Eden 's early dawn , when Time was in his youth .</p>
   <p>XLIX . How patient was that red man of the wood ! Not like the white man , garrulous of ill — Starving ! who heard his faintest wish for food ? Sleeping upon the snow-drift on the hill ! Who heard him chide the blast , or say ‘ twas cold ? His wounds are freezing ! is the anguish told ? Tell him his child was murdered with its mother ! He seems like carved out stone that has no woe to smother .</p>
   <p>L. With front erect , up-looking , dignified — Behold high Hecla in eternal snows ! Yet , while the raging tempest is defied , Deep in its bosom how the pent flame glows ! And when it bursts forth in its fiery wrath ! How melts the ice-hill from its fearful path , As on it rolls , unquench 'd , and all untam 'd !— Thus was it with that chief when his wild passions flam 'd .</p>
   <p>LI . Nature 's own statesman , by experience taught , He judged most wisely , and could act as well ; With quickest glance could read another 's thought , His own , the while , the keenest could not tell ; Warrior — with skill to lengthen , or combine , Lead on , or back , the desultory line ; Hunter — he passed the trackless forest through ,— Now on the mountain trod , now launch 'd the light canoe .</p>
   <p>LII . To the Great Spirit , would his spirit bow , With hopes that Nature 's impulses impart ; Unlike the Christian , who just says his vow With heart enough to say it all by heart . Did we his virtues from his faults discern , ‘ Twould teach a lesson that we well might learn : An inculcation worthiest of our creed , To tell the simple truth , and do the promised deed .</p>
   <p>LIII . How deeply eloquent was the debate , Beside the council fire of those red men ! With language burning as his sense of hate ; With gesture just , with eye of keenest ken ; With illustration simple , but profound , Drawn from the sky above him , or the ground Beneath his feet ; and with unfalt'ring zeal , He spoke from a warm heart and made e'en cold hearts feel .</p>
   <p>LIV . And this is Eloquence . ‘ Tis the intense , Impassioned fervor of a mind deep fraught With native energy , when soul and sense Burst forth , embodied in the burning thought ; When look , emotion , tone , are all combined — When the whole man is eloquent with mind — A power that comes not to the call or quest , But from the gifted soul , and the deep feeling breast .</p>
   <p>LV . Poor Logan had it , when he mourned that none Were left to mourn for him ;— ‘ twas his who swayed The Roman Senate by a look or tone ; ‘ Twas the Athenian 's , when his foes , dismayed , Shrunk from the earthquake of his trumpet call ; ‘ Twas Chatham 's , strong as either , or as all ; ‘ Twas Henry 's holiest , when his spirit woke Our patriot fathers ’ zeal to burst the British yoke .</p>
   <p>LVI . Isle of the beautiful ! how much thou art , Now in thy desolation , like the fate Of those who came in innocence of heart , With thy green Eden to assimilate : Then Art her coronal to Nature gave , To deck thy brow ; Queen of the onward wave ! And woman came , the beautiful and good , And made her happy home ‘ mid thy embracing flood .<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span></p>
   <p>LVII . Alas ! another came : his blandishment , The fascination of his smooth address , That read so well the very heart 's intent , And could so well its every thought express ,—<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>Won thy fair spirits to his dark design , And gave our country , too , her Cataline . He lives — the Roman traitor dared to die ! Yet , in their different fates , behold the homily .</p>
   <p>LVIII . Rome , torn by civil feuds and anarchy , Could not endure a traitor on her heart — For ready Faction , with her argus eye , Was ever watchful when to play her part ; And Freedom , with a nightmare on her breast , But show 'd she liv 'd by groaning when opprest ; And even Cato 's energy to save , Preserved her , but awhile , to sink upon her grave .</p>
   <p>LIX . Far different with our Country ! mark the time When she threw off her trans-atlantic yoke — Throughout the wide domain of her fair clime , But one high soldier from his promise broke : In that free gathering who would not enroll With all the patriot 's willingness of soul ? Our fathers fought for sacred home and hearth ! And were too young in crime to think of treason 's birth .</p>
   <p>LX . And when the war had passed , and Freedom raised Her temple to her worshippers , to bless Those who had lit her altar fires , that blazed To light the far untrodden wilderness , All felt the worship , all confessed the God , All knew the tyrant , and all curs 'd his rod — And if one heart fell from his promise then , Why , he might live like Cain , scorned of his fellow men .</p>
   <p>LXI . The Cain of Nations ! be that sov'reignty , That shall , for any purpose , seek to sever The glorious union of the brave and free — That , but for treason , will endure forever ! Her curse shall be the base redeemless lot Of the once free , who feel that they are not — Who tread their native soil as native slaves , And build their bondage house on their free fathers ’ graves .</p>
   <p>LXII . In such a state , would not a Cæsar rise , And chain the nation to his gory car , And pluck from out the blue of our bright skies , To form his diadem , that falling star ? Then , one by one , each brilliant light would fall , And primal chaos desolate them all — While Tyranny , with loud prophetic shout , Would wave his bloody sword , as each and all went out !</p>
   <p>LXIII . That free born spirit who could rouse again ? The dried-up fountain and the scorched up field . The breath , that withers mountain , flood , and plain , To Nature 's revolution learn to yield : As strong as ever , man may tread the soil , And sweat for others at his daily toil — But how shall he regain the gift unbought , The privilege to act the high resolve of thought ?</p>
   <p>LXIV . Say , how shall he regain it , when ‘ twas giv'n With broken vow , apostatizing breath ? How stand erect , how look to the bright Heav'n , Cloth 'd in the darkness of that moral death ? Her rights down trod , her star-lit banner rent , O ! where could Freedom find an armament ? How gather , in their glory and their pride , Her own grey father-band , who , for her , nobly died .</p>
   <p>LXV . United hearts have made united States ! What could a single , separate State have done Without the arms of her confederates ? Without their glorious leader , WASHINGTON ! They stand united , but divided fall — ‘ Twas union that gave liberty to all ! Then , who would call mad Discord from her cell , To scatter poisons there where the world 's manna fell !</p>
   <p>LXVI . Proud Venice , by her Doge 's solemn rite , Was wedded to the wave o'er which she rose : Thence came her lions ’ all-surpassing might — A greatness that ‘ twas glory to oppose . A peaceful pomp proclaimed her nuptial bands : Our Country 's bond of States , and hearts and hands , Was signed and sealed before a world amazed , While , for her nuptial torch , red Battle 's bacon blaz 'd !</p>
   <p>LXVII . It was a bloody sacrament : Death came Unto the bridal , like a bidden guest , The Priestess , FREEDOM , had but bless 'd the flame , E'er the fierce furies to the revel press 'd : The storm grew dark — its lightning flash 'd afar — Murder and Rapine leagu 'd themselves with War ; Yet , proudly and triumphantly , on high , That eagle-guarded banner waved to victory .</p>
   <p>LXVIII . How fiercely flew that eagle o'er the plain ! Then , Albion , sunk thy lion 's lordly crest ; Behold ! again he shakes his brist'ling mane — There is a serpent in that eagle 's nest , Seeking to sting her , in the feint to help , And give her free brood to the lion 's whelp — She strikes the reptile , headless down to earth — And thus may Treason die , let who will give it birth !</p>
   <p>LXIX . Last of the Signers ! a good night to thee ! Alas ! that such brave spirits must depart : Peace to thy ashes — to thy memory A monument in every living heart . It gives the spirit strength , endurance , pride , A lofty purpose , unto thine allied , To muse upon thy glory — ‘ tis to stand , As ‘ twere , upon thy hearth , and hold thee by the hand .</p>
   <p>LXX . And hear thee tell of thy illustrious peers Who stood beside thee , for our country , there , Fearless , amidst a host of pressing fears , And calm , where even Courage might despair . Ye staked , with this high energy indued , “ Life , Fortune , Honor , ” for the public good , And made your “ Declaration ” to the world , And , to the tyrant 's teeth , defiance sternly hurl 'd .</p>
   <p>LXXI . Alas ! the omen — in this awful hour , While Discord and Disunion rend the land ! Did'st thou take with thee Freedom 's priceless dower ? Did'st thou resume the gift of thine own hand , And bear the affrighted Goddess to the skies ? Are there no mourners o'er thy obsequies ? None , who , with high resolves , approach thy grave ? Or — flits a spirit there , that frights the modern brave ?</p>
   <p>LXXII . Say , has our Capital no tarpeian height<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>From which to hurl the traitor ? Standing now , Where once he stood , in patriotic might , With the fresh laurel wreath upon his brow , And Freedom burning on his lip of flame ; Does Pity plead forgiveness for his shame ? Then bear him thence , like Manlius , and be just — Or go to Vernon 's shade , and desecrate its dust .</p>
   <p>LXXIII . Soon must I mingle in the wordy war , Where Knavery takes in vice her sly degrees , As slip , away , not guilty , from the bar , Counsel , or client , as their Honors please . To breathe , in crowded courts , a pois'nous breath — To plead for life — to justify a death — To wrangle , jar , to twist , to twirl , to toil ,— This is the lawyer 's life — a heart-consuming moil .</p>
   <p>LXXIV . And yet it has its honors ; high of name And pure of heart , and eloquent of tongue , Have kindled , there , with a most holy flame , While thousands on their glowing accents hung ! And be it mine to follow where they 've led , To praise , if not to imitate , the dead — To hail their lustre , like the distant star Which the sad wayworn bless , and follow from afar .</p>
   <p>LXXV . My friends ! how often , in our social talk , Have we called up these names of spell-like power , As , arm in arm , we took the friendly walk , Or lingered out the evening 's parting hour — Or met at the debate , with joyous zest , To test our strength , and each to do his best ; While pun and prank we gaily gave and took , With friendship in each heart and pleasure in each look .</p>
   <p>LXXVI . I recollect it well , and lov 'd the time , When we were wont to meet : when last we met , I parted from you for this western clime , With the deep feeling never to forget . In the quick bustle of the busy throng , I feel that I shall miss ye , O ! how long ! The generous hearts who mann 'd my spirit on — Who sooth 'd me when I lost , and cheer 'd me if I won .<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span></p>
   <p>LXXVII . Away ! why should I muse in unsooth 'd sadness ! While the gay sky is smiling upon earth , Like a young mother , o'er her infant 's gladness , Blessing the early promise of its birth . The opening day-dawn breaks along the land , Like glorious FREEDOM , as her hopes expand ; While the far mountains tower to meet the glow , The altar fires are lit , burning on all below .</p>
   <p>LXXVIII . Oh ! light up every land , till , far and free , Their brave hearts come from mountain and from plain , While , with the shout of onward liberty , Old Earth to her foundation shakes again . The night is gone !— thus Tyranny recedes !— The sky is cloudless !— FREEDOM !— like thy deeds : A gladness beams o'er earth , and main , and Heav'n — Thus look the nations up , their chains , their chains are riv'n .</p>
   <p>LXXIX . Kingdoms are falling ! thrones — that have withstood The earthquake and the tempest in their shock , And brav 'd the host of battle 's fiery flood , Making of human rights the merest mock ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>Of blood , of agony , of human tears , The daily sacrifice of countless years — Are falling : may they fall on every shore , As fell the fiend from Heav'n , no more to rise — no more .</p>
   <p>LXXX . Greece gathers up again her glorious band ! With FREEDOM 'S loud hurra the Andes quake ! It swells , like ocean 's wave , from land to land — Bless them , our Father ! for thy children 's sake . They strike the noblest who shall strike the first — Wailing and prostrate , Tyranny accurst , Convulses earth with his fierce agonies ; But , if ye strike like men , the fell dictator dies !</p>
   <p>LXXXI . A tear for Poland ! many tears for her Who rose so nobly , and so nobly fell ! E'en at her broken shrine , a worshipper , In dust and ashes , let me say farewell ! Farewell ! brave spirits !— Earth ! and can it be , Thy sons beheld them struggling to be free — Unaided , saw them in their blood downtrod — Nations , ye are accurst ! be merciful , Oh God !</p>
   <p>LXXXII . My HOME ! it needs no prophet voice to tell Thy coming glories ; they are thronging fast , Like the enchantments of the Sybil 's cell , Expanding brighter to the very last : Fulfilling all the patriot 's burning vow , Be free forever my own land as now ! While the uprising nations hail thy star , And strike , for freedom , that God-sanctioned war .</p>
   <p>LXXXIII . And they may fall — but who shall date thy end ? Lo ! all the past has giv'n its light to thee : Expiring Rome , like a departing friend , Gave solemn warning to thy liberty : And e'en the empires , fabulously old In fruitful fable , have a moral told ; What say their fallen kings and shrineless God ? There is no “ right divine ” in the fell tyrant 's rod !</p>
   <p>LXXXIV . Thou learn'dst the lesson , long ago , my HOME , And taught'st it to a willing , wondering world , When thy bright stars rose o'er the ocean 's foam , And lit thy banner as it stood unfurl 'd ; When , from thy farthest mountain to the sea , All rose to bless that banner and be free , Where perch 'd thy eagle , in victorious might , While the proud , lordly lion fled in craven flight .</p>
   <p>LXXXV . Thou hast my heart — and freely do I bow , To bless thee , Freedom , on thy holiest shrine , And give to thee devotion 's warmest vow ; Oh ! let thy spirit mingle into mine : Thy temple is my country , whose far dome Circles as high as the Almighty 's home — Here , ‘ mid the glories of Creation 's birth , Thy altars spread around — this is my mother earth .</p>
   <p>LXXXVI . Glorious ! most glorious ! proudly let me stand , With the rapt fervor of a Poet 's eye , And pour my blessings on my native land ; Oh ! for the gift to tell thy destiny , And mould it to the telling — thou should'st rise , Eternal , as the stars that bless thy skies , And sparkle in thy banner — thou should'st be All that thy brave hearts wish 'd , who will 'd thee to be free .</p>
   <p>LXXXVII . And no portentous , fearful meteor , there , Should blaze , and blacken , and create dismay , Shaking fierce furies from its snaky hair ; No !— thou should'st light the Nations on their way , And be to them a watchword to fight well ; And should they fall , as Poland 's patriots fell . Oh ! cheer them with their exile-flag unfurl 'd , And give them freedom here , in her own Western world .</p>
   <p>LXXXVIII . Auspicious Time ! unroll the scroll of years — Behold our pious pilgrim fathers , when They launch 'd their little bark and braved all fears , Those peril-seeking , freedom-loving men ! Bless thee , thou Stream ! abiding blessings bless Thy farthest wave — Nile of the wilderness ! And be thy broad lands peopled , far and wide , With hearts as free as his who now doth bless thy tide .</p>
   <p>LXXXIX . And may new States arise , and stretch afar , In glory , to the great Pacific shore — A galaxy , without a falling star — Freedom 's own Mecca , where the world adore . There may Art build — to Knowledge there be giv'n The book of Nature and the light of Heav'n ; There be the Statesman 's and the patriot 's shrine , And Oh ! be happy there , the hearts that woo the Nine .</p>
   <p>XC . There is a welcome in this Western Land Like the old welcomes , which were said to give The friendly heart where'er they gave the hand ; Within this soil the social virtues live , Like its own forest trees , unprun 'd and free — At least there is one welcome here for me : A breast that pillowed all my sorrows past , And waits my coming now , and lov 'd me first and last .</p>
   <p>XCI . It binds my Eastern to my Western home ; Then let me banish thoughts that sad would be : Not like a leaf-borne insect on the foam , But like a bark upon a glorious sea — A little bark , perchance , yet firm withal , ‘ Midst bursting breakers that shall not appal — I 'll bide the coming of a brighter day , Or , to the far off West , pass , like the past , away .</p>

    <head>NOTES .</head>
    <p n="1">NOTE I .</p>
    <p n="2">“ The Emigrant , or Reflections , ” &amp; c .</p>
    <p n="3">Mr. Hammond , in the notice which he was so kind as to take of this POEM , suggested the alteration of the title from “ Reflections ” to “ Reveries . ” In retaining the first title , I do not do so because I think it best , but merely because it was the first title , and the one under which the extracts were given .</p>
    <p n="4">It seems to the author , if he may dare to hazard the remark , that the stanza in which he has attempted to write , has advantages over even the Spenserean stanzas . He understands the latter to be that in which the Fairy Queen , from whose author it takes its name — Beattie 's Minstrel , Thompson 's Castle of Indolence , Byron 's Childe Harold , &amp; c. &amp; c ., are written . The following is a stanza of it , from Childe Harold :</p>
    <p n="5">The starry fable of the Milky Way Has not thy story 's purity ; it is A constellation of a sweeter ray , And sacred nature triumphs more in this Reverse of her decree , than in the abyss Where sparkle distant worlds . Oh ! holiest nurse ! No drop of that clear spring its way shall miss To thy sire 's heart , replenishing its source With life , as our free souls rejoin the Universe .</p>
    <p n="6">Here , the reader will perceive that , in a stanza of nine lines , there is a necessity for the second , the fourth , the fifth , and the seventh lines to rhyme together ; and that the sixth , eighth and ninth lines must , also , rhyme together . To make the stanza correct , with these complicated embarrassments of rhyme , must not only cause great trouble , sometimes , to the easiest versifier , but to succeed in doing so , critically , he must often sacrifice a happy expression , a striking phrase , or a beautiful line . “ Words are things , ” says Mirabeau ; and , to the poet , they are things of potency . They are at once tools and materials in his headwork .</p>
    <p n="7">Any one who has read Childe Harold , must have observed that even the Lord of Poets , with all his powers of language , was often thus hampered , and that , for the sake of preserving the force of an expression , or a striking word , he used what are no rhymes at all , if Monk Lewis ’ remark to Scott , “ that a bad rhyme is no rhyme , ” be true .</p>
    <p n="8">Whereas , by making the stanza of but eight lines and having the first four lines to rhyme alternately , and the last four immediately , and by having the concluding line an Alexandrine , as in the Spenserean stanzas , the difficulty , arising from the necessity of having so many similar rhymes , would be obviated , and the poet would have much greater facilities in expressing himself well , without impairing the dignity or strength of what might still be called , from its many resemblances , the Spenserean stanzas ; at the same time , the monotony would be avoided , of which criticism has complained so much in the works of Pope and Goldsmith .</p>
    <p n="9">Very few readers of poetry , in the first poems which they open , are fond of those , no matter how great their merits , which are written in the Spenserean stanzas . They have to acquire a taste for it . They delight in simpler styles : this is one reason of Scott 's great popularity with many persons who seldom read any other poet , except perhaps , Burns . And even to those who have a natural taste for poetry , but who have not much cultivated it , the Spenserean stanza seems complicated , and , I will even venture to say , at first untunable ; and it is not at the first perusal that they perceive the beauties of those poems which are written in this style .</p>
    <p n="10">These remarks are hazarded very hastily . It would be much more difficult for the author to build the complicated verse of the Spenserean stanza , than this which he has attempted ; and , therefore , perhaps , very rashly , he concludes that it would be more difficult for others ; and , moreover , we easily persuade ourselves that what is most easily done it is best to do .</p>
    <p n="11">NOTE II .</p>
    <p n="12">“ But thou art given by the good all-giver , Blessing a land to be in turn most blest . ”</p>
    <p n="13">Thou exulting and abounding river , Making thy waves a blessing as they flow .</p>
    <p n="14">BYRON .</p>
    <p n="15">NOTE III .</p>
    <p n="16">“ Here once Boone trod — the hardy Pioneer — The only white man in the wilderness . ”</p>
    <p n="17">In a late work entitled “ Sketches of Western Adventure , ” a most interesting account is given of Boone , whose passion for a sylvan life was intense . Like Leather-stocking , it would seem that he always got lost in the clearing , and that only in the forest he knew his way and felt free and unincumbered . Then , like McGregor , “ standing on his native heath , ” he feared no difficulties or dangers . Byron , in his Don Juan , calls him “ The man of Ross run wild , ” and says , that he “ killed nothing but a bear or buck , ” but not so ; he had many deadly encounters with the Indians , and was repeatedly taken prisoner by them ; but he effected his escapes with great tact . The author of “ Sketches of Western Adventure , ” speaking of him , alone in the wilderness , says ,</p>
    <p n="18">“ The wild and solitary grandeur of the country around him , where not a tree had been cut , nor a house erected , was to him an inexhaustible source of admiration and delight ; and he says himself , that some of the most rapturous moments of his life were spent in those lonely rambles . The utmost caution was necessary to avoid the savages , and scarcely less to escape the ravenous hunger of the wolves that prowled nightly around him in immense numbers . He was compelled frequently to shift his lodging , and by undoubted signs , saw that the Indians had repeatedly visited his hut during his absence . He sometimes lay in canebrakes , without fire , and heard the yells of the Indians around him . Fortunately , however , he never encountered them . ”</p>
    <p n="19">Mr. John A. McClung is the author of the above mentioned work . This gentleman is also the author of a novel , entitled “ Camden , ” which has not received half the notice it deserved .</p>
    <p n="20">Mr. Flint has now in the press a life of Boone , which will soon be published . I am indebted to him for the following graphic note , concerning Boone :</p>
    <p n="21">“ This extraordinary man , whose birth is said to have been in Maryland , in Virginia , and in North Carolina , was in fact born in neither ; but in Pennsylvania , in Buck 's County , about twenty miles from Philadelphia . When he was three years old , his father removed to a water of the Schuylkill , not far from Reading . When he was thirteen years old , his father removed thence to the South Yadkin , North Carolina ; and in the midst of the bushy hills of that State the character of this Nimrod was developed .</p>
    <p n="22">“ No historical facts are better attested , than those , to which allusion is here made . The native sagacity , the robust hardihood , the invincible courage and spirit of endurance , put forth on all occasions by the pioneer of Kentucky , were , perhaps , never surpassed by any character on record . These traits were admirably balanced and relieved by a disposition peculiarly mild and gentle . In his old age he removed from Kentucky to the banks of the Missouri . The portrait of him in the capitol is said not to be a correct likeness . He was of the middle stature , of prodigious strength and swiftness , with sandy hair , and a bright complexion , a bold , prominent forehead , aquiline nose and compressed lips . There was a peculiar brightness , an unquenchable elasticity and force visible in his forehead and his eye , even under the frost of eighty winters . His old age was not cheered by affluence , but his departure was neither unhonored , nor unsung . No American character seems to have more chained interest and attention . His life constitutes the theme of Mr. Bryant 's ‘ Mountain Muse , ’ and he is one among the few , whom lord Byron honored with unalloyed eulogy , in seven or eight of the happiest stanzas of Don Juan . ”</p>
    <p n="23">NOTE IV .</p>
    <p n="24">And should they bear him prisoner from the fight , While they are sleeping , in the dead midnight , He slips the thongs that bind him to the tree , And leaving death with them , bounds home right happily .</p>
    <p n="25">The reader is referred to “ Sketches of Western Adventure , ” page 309 , for a most interesting account of the escape of two small boys from the Indians .</p>
    <p n="26">NOTE V .</p>
    <p n="27">“ How fertile is this ‘ dark and bloody ground ! ’ Here Death has given many a horrid wound . ”</p>
    <p n="28">Kentucky was called the “ dark and bloody ground ” by the Indians , in consequence of many of the fiercest contests having occurred there ; it was the common hunting ground of many of the tribes , and here they frequently met in their excursions , scarcely ever without bloodshed .</p>
    <p n="29">At my request , I was kindly furnished with the annexed note by Judge Hall , on the subject of Indian mounds , which should have been inserted under the passage which alludes to them ; but the reference at the proper place being accidentally omitted , it is given here . Judge Hall will readily imagine why the author has omitted some passages of the note , which to himself were not the least pleasing .</p>
    <p n="30">This gentleman has lately become a citizen of Cincinnati , where those , who knew him formerly but by his high reputation , now feel how much courtesy and kindness increase its charm .</p>
    <p n="31">Judge Hall is of opinion that most of the mounds are natural ; speaking of them he says :</p>
    <p n="32">“ There are few objects so well calculated to strike the poetic imagination as these mounds , standing alone in the wilderness . The belief that they are the workmanship of human hands , awakens curiosity and leads to a long train of reflections . For if men have thrown up these singular elevations , we feel inquisitive to know by whom , and for what purpose , they were erected . They are large and numerous ; and they bear every mark of great antiquity . Indeed , I am of opinion , that they are as old as the hills .</p>
    <p n="33">“ Supposing them to be artificial , we are led into a vast field of conjecture . Were they made by the present race of savages , who are ignorant of all the mechanic arts , and disinclined to labor ? If so , what inducement could have been placed before them , sufficiently powerful , to break down the barriers of nature , and bring men habitually indolent , to so herculean a task ? The Indian , as we see him now , never works . He is the sovereign of the woods , and strides over his heritage with the step of a master , and the wild glance of one who disdains employment . He submits to no restraint but that of military discipline .</p>
    <p n="34">“ Viewing them as artificial , nothing can be more curious ; and whether we suppose them to have been graves , or temples , or fortifications , they are equally calculated to awaken feelings of wonder , if not of awe . We see them in the wilderness , where , for ages , savage men alone have dwelt , and we behold them covered with majestic oaks , which have flourished for centuries . They have existed here in the silence and repose of the forest , unchanged amid the revolutions which have been carried on around them . They are among the few records of the past . A people ignorant of writing , painting , or sculpture , destitute of the mechanic arts , and without any knowledge of the use of metals , have left few memorials ; unless we see them in the mounds , we might , perhaps , say none .</p>
    <p n="35">“ If we suppose them to be natural , which , in my opinion , is the most rational belief , as to the majority of the mounds , they are still attractive , as natural curiosities , and as displaying a wonderful exhibition of the creative power . Beheld in any light , they are interesting . Whatever may have been their origin , they adorn the monotony of western scenery , and afford employment to the fancy of the traveller . The plodding foot may tread carelessly over them , the uninquiring eye may pass them , unheeded ; but the poet and philosopher linger around the hallowed spot where they stand , to catch inspiration , or to gather wisdom from these silent memorials . ”</p>
    <p n="36">Judge Hall further says , “ satisfied I am that if ever any rational hypothesis , in relation to these interesting remains of past ages , shall be invented , we shall owe it to the inspiration of the poet , and not to the researches of the philosopher . ”</p>
    <p n="37">It is very certain that no one can confront the traveller who may be speculating upon these mounds , as Edie Ochiltree did the Antiquary , with “ I mind the bigging o ’ it . ”</p>
    <p n="38">NOTE VI .</p>
    <p n="39">“ Isle of the beautiful ! how much thou art , Now , in thy desolation , like the fate Of those who came in innocence of heart With thy green Eden to assimilate : Then Art her coronal to Nature gave To deck thy brow , Queen of the onward wave ! And woman came , the beautiful and good , And made her happy home ‘ mid thy embracing flood . ”</p>
    <p n="40">The allusion , here , is to Blennerhasset 's Island , which is beautifully situated in the Ohio . The romantic story of its former inhabitants makes it a spot of great interest to the Emigrant , who , in descending the river , never fails to request that it may be pointed out to him ; and it is often the topic of conversation and conjecture to him and his companions for hours after they have passed it . The author is indebted to Morgan Neville , Esq ., for the following account of the Island and its unfortunate owner . Mr. Neville 's admirable tale of Mike Fink , and his other sketches , have created in the public an appetite for more , which they have long hoped he would be induced to gratify , with longer and more frequent productions ; or , at least , that he would collect what he has written into a volume .</p>
    <p n="41">“ BLENNERHASSET 'S ISLAND .— How many recollections of mingled pleasure and pain , does the name of this once beautiful spot , call to mind ! In descending the Ohio , I never come in sight of the Island , without sensations almost too powerful to bear ; and I linger on the deck of the boat , until the point below snatches it from view . The first impressions were made on me in early youth , and time cannot efface them ; on the contrary , the long vista through which I look back to this western ‘ Eden , ’ presents it , probably , with exaggerated colorings of beauty and loveliness . The traveller , as he wanders over the grounds , once consecrated by philanthropy , cannot reconcile it with probability , that a proud mansion , a quarter of a century since , was here erected , dedicated to hospitality , where a priestess , in the person of an elegant and refined lady , shed an influence around that attracted to its portal the stranger from every country . In looking at a scene , now desolate and repulsive , he can scarcely credit the fact , that , within that period , the same place was embellished by gardens , groves , and arbors , upon which taste was exhausted , and which cost a fortune to realize . The villa of Blennerhasset was really a beacon-light in the wilderness , that seemed created to invite the approach of the stranger to enjoy that repose which the sluggish and comfortless mode of travelling of that day , rendered so gratifying . The only sounds now heard , are the sighing of the wind through the lofty cotton wood , or the puffing of steam , as some boat rushes rapidly past the prosperous settlement of Bellepre . There was a time when music of a less melancholy character breathed upon the ear ; when a master hand swept the chords , and science and taste directed the scene .</p>
    <p n="42">Herman Blennerhasset and his accomplished wife have sat for many a picture ; but , after all , Fancy , alone , guided the pencil , and the originals have never been truly sketched . The reality of their history possesses sufficient interest , without the aid of fiction , to enlist the sympathies of the most romantic . Born to fortune , and nobly connected , Blennerhasset stood in the front rank of Irish society . Educated for the bar , he distinguished himself on many occasions , and he was the assistant counsel , with Curran , in the celebrated trial of Hamilton Rowan . But his disposition was restless , his mind visionary , and , doubtless , he felt sincerely for the degraded state of his country . Notwithstanding his close relationship to the aristocracy of Ireland , and the glaring unfitness of his character for scenes of daring and of danger , he connected himself with the leading yeomen of that day , and became the intimate associate and co-adjutor of Arthur O'Conner . He continued to labor in the cause of Liberty , until the eyes of Government were turned upon him ; the result is a matter of public history : O'Conner was arrested , and Blennerhasset escaped . He had the good fortune , however , to secure a considerable portion of his property , and , accompanied by his accomplished wife , an English lady , he arrived in New York in 1796 or ‘ 97 , with what , in this country , was esteemed a large fortune .</p>
    <p n="43">He was , however , a visionary ; he knew nothing of human nature , nothing of the practical business of life . With considerable literary acquirements , and much pretensions to science , he gave himself up to all the reveries and schemes of modern philosophy ; with Southey , Godwin , and the whole class , he was continually dreaming about the perfectibility of human nature , and believed that innocence was alone to be found in that portion of humanity , which approached the nearest to the state of nature . With these notions , which he succeeded , in some measure , in imparting to his young and interesting partner , he declined establishing himself in any of our Atlantic cities , then the only places in the Union offering attractions to a foreigner of taste and fortune , and turned his attention , to the magnificent solitudes of the West . He purchased a portion of the Island in Virginia , near the mouth of the Little Kenhawa , which has been consecrated by his misfortunes , and executed those embellishments which have since become the theme of many a fanciful speech and tale .</p>
    <p n="44">Considering himself a second Capac , he set about acquiring an influence over the rude inhabitants of the Virginia shores , which might enable him to test the efficiency of his favorite system . But his exertions were abortive , and he became convinced of the folly of his early speculations on human nature ; his unsophisticated scholars , affecting to admire him , overreached him on all occasions , and then laughed at him . He embarked in commercial speculations ; this proved a failure , and he stopped in time to save a portion of the large fortune which , a few years before , he brought from Europe . He recanted , in bitterness of feeling , his early political principles , and began to sigh for the charms of refined society . Discontent stole into his domestic circle , and the idea of educating his two interesting boys in the desert became insupportable .</p>
    <p n="45">Oh ! quantum est in rebus in ave !</p>
    <p n="46">During this state of feeling , Colonel Burr presented himself , armed with all the fascinations of manners and address , which so eminently distinguished him . He soon became the ruler of the destiny of the Island pair , and unfolded to them , with resistless eloquence , his magnificent project of the conquest of Mexico , gilding his own ambition under the plausible motive of relieving enslaved millions from the thraldom of Spanish tyranny . The idea of becoming prominent members of a court that would rival the ancient splendor of Montezuma , and the modern glory of Napoleon , absorbed every other feeling . The remains of this once large fortune were embarked in the scheme , and ruin and misery were the consequence . What he felt and saw as but a misdemeanor , was distorted , by political rancor , into treason ; and , although one of the most enlightened juries that were ever empanelled , pronounced an acquittal , Blennerhasset was left destitute of means , and blasted in reputation . He attempted to retrieve his affairs as a cotton planter , but was unsuccessful ; he afterwards removed to Montreal , to resume his profession . Within a few years he has returned to England , the outlawry against him having been removed ; and those who feel an interest in the history of this persecuted family , may be gratified to know that their decline of life will not be devoid of comfort . They reside near Bath , in England , with a sister of Blennerhasset , the relict of the late admiral De Courcy . The evening of life promises to close free from those clouds that so long lowered over them .</p>
    <p n="47">NOTE VII .</p>
    <p n="48">“ Alas ! another came , ” &amp; c .</p>
    <p n="49">See Mr. Wirt 's character of Colonel Burr , in his great speech against him . It was scarcely necessary to refer to this speech , as it is in the mouth of every school boy .</p>
    <p n="50">NOTE VIII .</p>
    <p n="51">“ Say , has our Capital no Tarpeian height From which to hurl the traitor ? ”</p>
    <p n="52">These lines were written in the excitement which prevailed during the session of the last Congress , when the Nullifiers were fulminating their doctrines of disunion and prophesying the downfall of the Republic , when he , who has not yet lost all his original brightness , was acting a part which Milton has described .</p>
    <p n="53">This may account for what now may be deemed harshness .</p>
    <p n="54">NOTE IX .</p>
    <p n="55">“ I recollect it well , and loved the time , When we were wont to meet : when last we met I parted from you for this western clime , With the deep feeling never to forget . In the quick bustle of the busy throng , I feel that I shall miss ye , O ! how long ! The generous hearts who mann 'd my spirit on — Who sooth 'd me when I lost and cheer 'd me when I won . ”</p>
    <p n="56">I have both rhyme and reason for remembering my young friends of Baltimore . More frank , fearless , and generous spirits , it has not been my lot to meet : social companions , firm friends , and with highly cultivated minds , they possess an esprit du corps which gives such qualities their strongest attractions . They have made Baltimore to me the “ city of the soul . ”</p>
    <p n="57">NOTE X .</p>
    <p n="58">“ Making of human rights the merest mock . ” The fiend 's arch mock . SHAKSPEARE .</p>
