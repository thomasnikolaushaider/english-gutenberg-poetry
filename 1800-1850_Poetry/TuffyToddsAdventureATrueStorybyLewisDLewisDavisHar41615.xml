   <p>INTRODUCTORY NOTE .</p>
   <p>“ TUFFY TODD 'S ADVENTURE ” is the record of an incident which actually occurred during the past summer while the writer was spending his vacation in a retired but charming part of the Catskill Mountains .</p>
   <p>It was written for the amusement of the guests at TODD 'S “ Hillside Home , ” to whom the facts as set forth were familiar , and who will recognize in the following lines the story as it originally appeared in the so-called Dry Brook Evening Mail .</p>

    <p>TUFFY TODD 'S ADVENTURE .</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">There is a little dog whose name</l>
     <l n="3">Is Tuffy Todd , who has the same</l>
     <l n="4">Wise look as many a dog you 've met ;</l>
     <l n="5">And is a well-bred house-dog pet ,</l>
     <l n="6">But quaintly called in rhyme a hound ,</l>
     <l n="7">To please the poet 's ear for sound .</l>
     <l n="8">Round as a mole , he 's fat and fair ,</l>
     <l n="9">And robed in coat of whitest hair ;</l>
     <l n="10">His soft brown eyes are bright and clear ,</l>
     <l n="11">His little ears are quick to hear .</l>
     <l n="12">He has a kind expressive face ,</l>
     <l n="13">With every feature full of grace ;</l>
     <l n="14">In disposition meek and mild ,</l>
     <l n="15">He 's gentle as a little child ;</l>
     <l n="16">But has his own peculiar way ,</l>
     <l n="17">As all who hear will surely say .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="18">He is to people so polite ,</l>
     <l n="19">You 'd think he 'd never bark or bite ,</l>
     <l n="20">But strangers climbing up the hill</l>
     <l n="21">Will shout in vain : “ You hound , be still ! ”</l>
     <l n="22">And traveler late in midnight dark</l>
     <l n="23">Is sure to hear Tuff 's loudest bark ,</l>
     <l n="24">While tramps who come about the yard</l>
     <l n="25">Must flee or face a valiant guard .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="26">Although he has a host of friends ,</l>
     <l n="27">To them he rarely condescends ,</l>
     <l n="28">And their caresses kindly made</l>
     <l n="29">Are with indifference coldly paid .</l>
     <l n="30">He lives for Master Orrin Todd</l>
     <l n="31">And worships him as household god ;</l>
     <l n="32">With him Tuff wildly romps and plays ,</l>
     <l n="33">And from his side but seldom strays .</l>
     <l n="34">At times when Orrin goes away</l>
     <l n="35">To tarry but a single day ,</l>
     <l n="36">He bids his Tuffy stay behind</l>
     <l n="37">And try to have a peaceful mind .</l>
     <l n="38">But Tuff , so sad and desolate ,</l>
     <l n="39">Lies down alone to meditate ;</l>
     <l n="40">Or seeks the porch — a sunny place —</l>
     <l n="41">To watch for Todd 's returning face ,</l>
     <l n="42">Or wait until the voice so dear</l>
     <l n="43">Shall fall like music on his ear .</l>
     <l n="44">Unmoved by other sight or sound</l>
     <l n="45">He lies as if in thought profound .</l>
     <l n="46">Call him , he seems both deaf and dumb</l>
     <l n="47">Unless you say : “ Ho ! Orrin 's come ! ”</l>
     <l n="48">When quick , like one from sleep , he springs ,</l>
     <l n="49">And flies , as swift as bird on wings ,</l>
     <l n="50">To meet his master and his friend ,—</l>
     <l n="51">Then Tuffy 's mourning has an end .</l>
     <l n="52">His ways eccentric may appear ,</l>
     <l n="53">But in the sequel they 'll be clear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="54">Now little Tuff , it may seem strange ,</l>
     <l n="55">Had lived at home , nor thought of change ;</l>
     <l n="56">But one calm morning clear and bright ,</l>
     <l n="57">As if new visions filled his sight ,</l>
     <l n="58">To Griffin 's Corners begged a ride</l>
     <l n="59">In Orrin 's wagon by his side .</l>
     <l n="60">Good Master Todd could not deny</l>
     <l n="61">The pleading of poor Tuffy 's eye ,</l>
     <l n="62">And said : “ Jump in and take a seat ,</l>
     <l n="63">And you shall have a royal treat ;</l>
     <l n="64">For though we go by mountain road</l>
     <l n="65">And do not want a heavy load ,</l>
     <l n="66">Our sprightly horses strong and true</l>
     <l n="67">Will never mind a mite like you . ”</l>
     <l n="68">Then Tuff leaped in and sat erect</l>
     <l n="69">As if to show his intellect ,</l>
     <l n="70">When off they rode with hearts of glee ,</l>
     <l n="71">And warmer friends you rarely see .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="72">Now Orrin thought it would be nice</l>
     <l n="73">To give his Tuffy some advice :</l>
     <l n="74">“ Be careful , Tuffy mine , ” said he ,</l>
     <l n="75">“ We go where many dangers be ;</l>
     <l n="76">Turn not aside nor leave my track</l>
     <l n="77">Till setting sun shall warn us back .</l>
     <l n="78">In town you will a stranger be ;</l>
     <l n="79">Again I say : Go not from me . ”</l>
     <l n="80">To which the simple dog replied :</l>
     <l n="81">“ Oh , never will I leave thy side ,</l>
     <l n="82">But follow where thy footsteps lead ,</l>
     <l n="83">Thou dearest friend in time of need . ”</l>
     <l n="84">( Our Tuff can talk like dogs of old</l>
     <l n="85">Of whom in fable AEsop told . )</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="86">Then Todd , to pass away the time ,</l>
     <l n="87">Thus entertained his guest in rhyme :</l>
     <l n="88">“ I 've always made you stay at home</l>
     <l n="89">And never let you widely roam ,</l>
     <l n="90">Because I feared you might be lost</l>
     <l n="91">And by the world be rudely tossed ;</l>
     <l n="92">Or lest in some unlucky way</l>
     <l n="93">You might be hurt as on that day —</l>
     <l n="94">That doleful , direful day ,— when life</l>
     <l n="95">And death seemed balanced in the strife .</l>
     <l n="96">You then were but a little pup ,</l>
     <l n="97">And with a snail could scarce keep up ,</l>
     <l n="98">But seeing Flora 's gentle pace ,</l>
     <l n="99">You thought with her you 'd run a race !</l>
     <l n="100">And as she moved along the road</l>
     <l n="101">And pulled with care her heavy load ,</l>
     <l n="102">You chanced to fall beneath the wheel</l>
     <l n="103">Which crushed your leg and made you reel .</l>
     <l n="104">O dreadful sight ! O fearful cry !</l>
     <l n="105">A mangled limb ! no surgeon nigh !</l>
     <l n="106">I stanched the blood which freely flowed ,</l>
     <l n="107">And in my arms — a tiny load —</l>
     <l n="108">I bore you safely to our door ;</l>
     <l n="109">Then said : ‘ You shall go out no more</l>
     <l n="110">Until your leg is fully healed ,</l>
     <l n="111">Or death shall take you from the field ! ’</l>
     <l n="112">I set and bandaged well your limb ,</l>
     <l n="113">( Should surgeon doubt , I 'd challenge him ,)</l>
     <l n="114">And laid you on an easy bed</l>
     <l n="115">And saw that you were kindly fed .</l>
     <l n="116">I closely watched you night and day</l>
     <l n="117">And did not fail for you to pray !</l>
     <l n="118">When you had reached the third long week ,</l>
     <l n="119">Thank God ! ( with reverence do I speak )</l>
     <l n="120">‘ Twas plain you needed nothing more</l>
     <l n="121">Than just to walk about the floor .</l>
     <l n="122">At length , when people thought you dead ,</l>
     <l n="123">You left your room and little bed ;</l>
     <l n="124">“ He 's tough , ” they said , “ as hickory rod , ”</l>
     <l n="125">And called you “ Tough , ” then Tuffy Todd ;</l>
     <l n="126">And thus you see it strangely came</l>
     <l n="127">You have a soft and pretty name .</l>
     <l n="128">Now since to perfect health restored ,</l>
     <l n="129">To thank me well you can afford . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="130">Tuff answered : “ Do you doubt , dear friend ,</l>
     <l n="131">That I shall thank you to the end ?</l>
     <l n="132">Since I was struck by wheel so rude ,</l>
     <l n="133">Have I not shown you gratitude ?</l>
     <l n="134">Have I not always been to you</l>
     <l n="135">Obedient , faithful , good and true ?</l>
     <l n="136">Through evil and through good report</l>
     <l n="137">I 've never failed in my support !</l>
     <l n="138">Forsaking friends , let none deny</l>
     <l n="139">For you I 've lived , for you I 'll die ;</l>
     <l n="140">What care I for the world around</l>
     <l n="141">When all my joy in you is found ?</l>
     <l n="142">Please pardon if too bold I seem</l>
     <l n="143">And hold me firm in your esteem . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="144">“ I did not mean to grieve your heart ,</l>
     <l n="145">Good Tuff , nor cause a single smart ,</l>
     <l n="146">But just to have a little play ,</l>
     <l n="147">I thought I 'd see what you would say</l>
     <l n="148">In answer to my sober talk ,</l>
     <l n="149">While slow the horses onward walk . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="150">Conversing thus as friend with friend ,</l>
     <l n="151">At last they reach their journey 's end .</l>
     <l n="152">Todd 's heart with anxious fears beset ,</l>
     <l n="153">Foreboding peril to his pet ,</l>
     <l n="154">He turns to Tuffy : “ You 've been warned</l>
     <l n="155">In language clear and unadorned ,</l>
     <l n="156">To stay by me and to beware</l>
     <l n="157">Of dangers lurking everywhere .</l>
     <l n="158">Although no prophet born or bred ,</l>
     <l n="159">Though on my mind no light is shed ,</l>
     <l n="160">I fear from knowledge of your race ,</l>
     <l n="161">The day will end in your disgrace . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="162">Out jumped brave Tuff and Farmer Todd ,</l>
     <l n="163">But scarce had gone a single rod</l>
     <l n="164">Before they heard : “ Bow-wow ! Friend Tuff !</l>
     <l n="165">For that 's your name I 'm sure enough ;</l>
     <l n="166">How glad I am to see your face</l>
     <l n="167">And give to you a friend 's embrace ;</l>
     <l n="168">Now while in town , stay thou with me ,</l>
     <l n="169">And boon companions we will be . ”</l>
     <l n="170">Then Tuff , ( poor “ Innocent abroad , ”</l>
     <l n="171">Who never dreamed of any fraud ,)</l>
     <l n="172">Replied : “ Perhaps we 've met before ,</l>
     <l n="173">I 'll take your word and ask no more :</l>
     <l n="174">It would not seem polite , I know ,</l>
     <l n="175">Should I refuse with you to go . ”</l>
     <l n="176">Away they marched , as large as life ,</l>
     <l n="177">Their hearts with hope and pleasure rife ,</l>
     <l n="178">And wandered in their heedless play ,</l>
     <l n="179">Through many a dark and devious way .</l>
     <l n="180">Unchecked they raced and chased around ,</l>
     <l n="181">A lawless cur and recreant hound ;</l>
     <l n="182">They took no note of time , nor cared</l>
     <l n="183">How far they strayed nor how they fared ;</l>
     <l n="184">For Tuff could not foresee his woes</l>
     <l n="185">Till darkness did around him close .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="186">Oh , Tuffy , born and reared in ease ,</l>
     <l n="187">With bread enough to eat and cheese ,</l>
     <l n="188">Where now thy master 's tender care ?</l>
     <l n="189">Where now the bed thou erst didst share ?</l>
     <l n="190">Thy new-made friend all false will be</l>
     <l n="191">In time of thy adversity !</l>
     <l n="192">Upon the cold , cold ground to-night</l>
     <l n="193">No sleep shall come ere morning light ,</l>
     <l n="194">Nor morsel sweet for hungry maw ,</l>
     <l n="195">Nor peace for nature 's broken law !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="196">The westering sun had low declined ,</l>
     <l n="197">When homeward with an easy mind</l>
     <l n="198">Good Orrin turned his horses ’ feet ,</l>
     <l n="199">Expecting there his dog to meet ;</l>
     <l n="200">But drawing near , no Tuff was found</l>
     <l n="201">To greet him with accustomed sound .</l>
     <l n="202">Poor Orrin could not sleep a wink ,</l>
     <l n="203">But lay awake all night to think</l>
     <l n="204">How sad the fate of Tuff might be ,</l>
     <l n="205">Who late was in prosperity .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="206">Back , in the early morning bright ,</l>
     <l n="207">To Griffin 's Orrin took his flight ,</l>
     <l n="208">But thoughts of Tuff so filled his mind</l>
     <l n="209">No other thought a place could find ,</l>
     <l n="210">And as he passed each neighbor 's door</l>
     <l n="211">‘ Twas little known the load he bore .</l>
     <l n="212">The dogs ran out and barked so bold</l>
     <l n="213">They wakened echoes in the wold ,</l>
     <l n="214">While ducks and geese joined in the strife</l>
     <l n="215">And quacked and screamed for their dear life .</l>
     <l n="216">Then proudly crowed vain chanticleer :</l>
     <l n="217">“ I am , you see , without a peer ,</l>
     <l n="218">Let none within my realm intrude</l>
     <l n="219">To scare my hens and little brood . ”</l>
     <l n="220">But patient kine in farmyard pent</l>
     <l n="221">Were mute with meek-eyed wonderment ,</l>
     <l n="222">While grazing sheep on hillside near ,</l>
     <l n="223">Heard all and said : “ We need not fear ; ”</l>
     <l n="224">Each mother called her own dear lamb ,</l>
     <l n="225">Who answered back : “ Oh , here I am ! ”</l>
     <l n="226">The squirrel with his nimble feet</l>
     <l n="227">Now quickly found a safe retreat ,</l>
     <l n="228">And from the wall , or limb on high ,</l>
     <l n="229">Peeped slyly out as Todd went by .</l>
     <l n="230">The birds from out the leafy trees ,</l>
     <l n="231">So gently swayed by morning breeze ,</l>
     <l n="232">Poured forth their notes in merry lay</l>
     <l n="233">And sang : “ Good speed and happy day ! ”</l>
     <l n="234">And insect world , on joyous wing ,</l>
     <l n="235">In sunlight clear did sweetly sing ,</l>
     <l n="236">Or hum in myriad tones so gay :</l>
     <l n="237">“ We cheer the traveler on his way . ”</l>
     <l n="238">But ferns and flowers in wayside beds</l>
     <l n="239">With meek surprise did lift their heads</l>
     <l n="240">And whisper low : “ Our friend 's in haste</l>
     <l n="241">And has no time on us to waste .</l>
     <l n="242">In days gone by he 'd stop awhile</l>
     <l n="243">To praise our charms and make us smile ,</l>
     <l n="244">Or take us in his gentle hands</l>
     <l n="245">As if rare gifts from foreign lands . ”</l>

     <l n="246">And thus each loving , living thing</l>
     <l n="247">Had kindly thought or word to bring ,</l>
     <l n="248">Which proved a balm to soothe Todd 's soul</l>
     <l n="249">As he moved onward to his goal .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="250">The livelong day through street and lane</l>
     <l n="251">He sought his dog , but sought in vain ;</l>
     <l n="252">From house to house he asked each man ,</l>
     <l n="253">“ Where 's Tuff ? Pray tell me if you can . ”</l>
     <l n="254">“ Why , Tuff has gone with Bruno Brown ,</l>
     <l n="255">A dog , ” they said , “ of poor renown . ”</l>
     <l n="256">It was enough to turn one 's brain</l>
     <l n="257">To always hear this sad refrain .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="258">Retracing now in twilight drear</l>
     <l n="259">His weary steps , Todd dropped a tear</l>
     <l n="260">And took with heavy heart the way</l>
     <l n="261">His feet had pressed at opening day ,</l>
     <l n="262">And walked in doubt and gloom along</l>
     <l n="263">Where late he sang his cheerful song ,—</l>
     <l n="264">Where frisked his faithful dog with glee</l>
     <l n="265">And kept him joyful company .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="266">Poor Tuff , a wanderer forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="267">Now loud bewailed that he was born !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="268">For though in darkness and in grief ,</l>
     <l n="269">There came no friend to his relief .</l>
     <l n="270">But being born he did not care</l>
     <l n="271">Just then to die . With reason rare ,</l>
     <l n="272">He searched along the dusty ground</l>
     <l n="273">To see where footprints could be found ,</l>
     <l n="274">When he with keen instinctive nose</l>
     <l n="275">Discerned the course of Orrin 's toes !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="276">Then light and hope began to rise</l>
     <l n="277">And cheer the darkness of his skies ,</l>
     <l n="278">While slow he kept the lonely road</l>
     <l n="279">Which led him safe to his abode .</l>
     <l n="280">Scarce twelve had struck the kitchen clock</l>
     <l n="281">When lo ! was heard a scratch or knock .</l>
     <l n="282">“ Oh ! ” said his wife : “ Oh , Orrin dear !</l>
     <l n="283">The lost is found ; our Tuff is here ! ”</l>
     <l n="284">Then up sprang Orrin with a bound ,</l>
     <l n="285">And welcomed home his truant hound ,</l>
     <l n="286">Whose downcast eye and trembling frame</l>
     <l n="287">Betrayed a sense of guilt and shame .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="288">But Todd in sweet forgiving mood</l>
     <l n="289">Spread Tuff a couch and gave him food ,</l>
     <l n="290">And bade him now find rest in sleep ,</l>
     <l n="291">And thus forget his sorrows deep .</l>
     <l n="292">Then Tuff in silence ate his meal ,</l>
     <l n="293">But made by looks this sad appeal :</l>
     <l n="294">“ Oh friend , in sorrow and in cheer ,</l>
     <l n="295">There 's none on earth as you so dear ;</l>
     <l n="296">For all the trouble I have brought</l>
     <l n="297">I am not worthy of your thought ,</l>
     <l n="298">And would receive a just return</l>
     <l n="299">Should you my presence coldly spurn ,</l>
     <l n="300">Or from me turn with angry frown</l>
     <l n="301">And let me in despair sink down .</l>
     <l n="302">I will not plead in self-defence</l>
     <l n="303">Nor try to prove my innocence ,</l>
     <l n="304">But truth requires that I should say</l>
     <l n="305">How I was duped and led astray</l>
     <l n="306">By cunning dog , who boldly claimed</l>
     <l n="307">He 'd seen my home ere I was named —</l>
     <l n="308">Had heard of Tuffy Todd before</l>
     <l n="309">When passing by our cottage door !</l>
     <l n="310">He led me captive at his will</l>
     <l n="311">And made me suffer direst ill ,</l>
     <l n="312">Which was no more than I deserved ,</l>
     <l n="313">Who from the path of duty swerved .</l>
     <l n="314">I have my sins and woes confessed ,</l>
     <l n="315">And ask forgiveness , peace and rest .</l>
     <l n="316">Oh grant the mercy which I crave</l>
     <l n="317">Or I shall find an early grave ! ”</l>

     <l n="318">To such petition all unused ,</l>
     <l n="319">With faltering words and eyes suffused ,</l>

     <l n="325">With deep and humble penitence ,</l>
     <l n="326">I grant forgiveness full and free ,</l>

     <l n="331">From great to small then changed his theme .</l>

     <l n="333">I 'll see what can for you be done .</l>
     <l n="334">There comes just now this happy thought —</l>
     <l n="335">For you a collar shall be bought ,</l>
     <l n="336">That if perchance you go astray</l>
     <l n="337">You will be known , though far away .</l>
     <l n="338">On it must be inscribed your name</l>
     <l n="339">And Latin words to give you fame !</l>
     <l n="340">Nil desperandum , they shall be ,</l>

     <l n="345">The poet 's pen may not disclose .</l>
     <l n="346">To dog and master , both so true ,</l>
     <l n="347">Long life and peace , and our adieu .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="348">Now turning from the gay or sad ,</l>
     <l n="349">This moral we will simply add :</l>

     <l n="351">Accept the words of love and truth :</l>
     <l n="352">Not all is gold with golden gleam ,</l>
     <l n="353">Not all are friends who friendly seem ;</l>
