    <head>AFTERWARD .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">There is no vacant chair . The loving meet —</l>
     <l n="2">A group unbroken — smitten , who knows how ?</l>
     <l n="3">One sitteth silent only , in his usual seat ;</l>
     <l n="4">We gave him once that freedom . Why not now ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Perhaps he is too weary , and needs rest ;</l>
     <l n="6">He needed it too often , nor could we</l>
     <l n="7">Bestow . God gave it , knowing how to do so best .</l>
     <l n="8">Which of us would disturb him ? Let him be .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">There is no vacant chair . If he will take</l>
     <l n="10">The mood to listen mutely , be it done .</l>
     <l n="11">By his least mood we crossed , for which the heart must ache ,</l>
     <l n="12">Plead not nor question ! Let him have this one .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Death is a mood of life . It is no whim</l>
     <l n="14">By which life 's Giver mocks a broken heart .</l>
     <l n="15">Death is life 's reticence . Still audible to Him ,</l>
     <l n="16">The hushed voice , happy , speaketh on , apart .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">There is no vacant chair . To love is still</l>
     <l n="18">To have . Nearer to memory than to eye ,</l>
     <l n="19">And dearer yet to anguish than to comfort , will</l>
     <l n="20">We hold him by our love , that shall not die .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>For while it doth not , thus he cannot . Try ! Who can put out the motion or the smile ? The old ways of being noble all with him laid by ? Because we love , he is . Then trust awhile .</p>

     <l n="1">Oh , joy of the dying !</l>
     <l n="2">At last thou art mine .</l>
     <l n="3">And leaping to meet thee ,</l>
     <l n="4">Impatient to greet thee ,</l>
     <l n="5">A rapid and rapturous , sensitive , fine</l>
     <l n="6">Gayety steals through my pulses to-day ,</l>
     <l n="7">Daring and doubting like pleasure</l>
     <l n="8">Forbidden , or Winter looking at May .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Oh , sorrow of living !</l>
     <l n="10">Make way for the thrill</l>
     <l n="11">Of the soul that is starting —</l>
     <l n="12">Onlooking — departing</l>
     <l n="13">Across the threshold of clay .</l>
     <l n="14">Bend , bow to the will</l>
     <l n="15">Of the soul that is up and away !</l>

    <head>THE ROOM 'S WIDTH .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I think if I should cross the room ,</l>
     <l n="2">Far as fear ;</l>
     <l n="3">Should stand beside you like a thought —</l>
     <l n="4">Touch you , Dear !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Like a fancy . To your sad heart</l>
     <l n="6">It would seem</l>
     <l n="7">That my vision passed and prayed you ,</l>
     <l n="8">Or my dream .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Then you would look with lonely eyes —</l>
     <l n="10">Lift your head —</l>
     <l n="11">And you would stir , and sigh , and say —</l>
     <l n="12">“ She is dead . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Baffled by death and love , I lean</l>

    <head>THE ANGEL JOY .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Oh , was it a death-dream not dreamed through ,</l>
     <l n="2">That eyed her like a foe ?</l>
     <l n="3">Or only a sorrow left over from life ,</l>
     <l n="4">Half-finished years ago ?</l>

     <l n="5">How long was it since she died — who told ?</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">But the custom of earth was stronger than Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="10">And the habit of life than death ,</l>
     <l n="11">How should an anguish as old as thought</l>
     <l n="12">Be healed by the end of breath ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Tissue and nerve and pulse of her soul</l>

    <head>CAPE ANN , SEPTEMBER SURF . 1882 .</head>
     <l n="1">White fire upon the gray-green waste of waves ,</l>
     <l n="2">The low light of the breaker flares . Ah , see !</l>
     <l n="3">Outbursting on a sky of steel and ice ,</l>
     <l n="4">The baffled sun stabs wildly at the gale .</l>
     <l n="5">The water rises like a god aglow ,</l>
     <l n="6">Who all too long hath slept , and dreamed too sure ,</l>
     <l n="7">And finds his goddess fled his empty arms .</l>
     <l n="8">Silent , the mighty cliff receives at last</l>
     <l n="9">That rage of elemental tenderness ,</l>
     <l n="10">The old , omnipotent caress she knows .</l>
     <l n="11">Yet once the solid earth did melt for her</l>
     <l n="12">And , pitying , made retreat before her flight ;</l>
     <l n="13">Would she have hidden her forever there ?</l>
     <l n="14">Or did she , wavering , linger long enough</l>
     <l n="15">To let the accustomed torrent chase her down ?</l>
     <l n="16">Over the neck of the gorge ,</l>
     <l n="17">I cling . Lean desperately !</l>
     <l n="18">He who feared a chasm 's edge</l>
     <l n="19">Were never the one to see</l>
     <l n="20">The torment and the triumph hid</l>
     <l n="21">Where the deep surges be .</l>
     <l n="22">I pierce the gulf ; I sweep the coast</l>
     <l n="23">Where wide the tide swings free ;</l>
     <l n="24">I search as never soul sought before .</l>
     <l n="25">There is not patience enough in all the shore ,</l>
     <l n="26">There is not passion enough in all the sea ,</l>
     <l n="27">To tell my love for thee .</l>
