    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">Whether the Poet undertook to write and SING A SONG OF SIXPENCE for that popular price is not stated in his simple rhyme , but , at all events , we learn that he started with “ a pocket full , ” and proceeded to draw on his imagination for all it was worth . What that famous blackbird-pie really cost — except in black-birds — is not disclosed , though the King seemed to show some anxiety about the state of his treasury , as he was discovered “ in his counting house ” imediately after the feast . But while the Queen , regardless of expense , regales herself on “ bread and honey ” in “ the parlour ” , and her Maid-of-honour , or perhaps of-all-work , is engaged at the clothes-line , nothing is said about a princess .</p>
    <p n="2">No doubt there was a princess , and that Princess might have been PRINCESS BELLE-ETOILE ? Anyway here she is in the same boat — I mean book — and certainly her adventures are romantic enough to prevent any surprise at the company in which Her Highness now finds herself .</p>
    <p n="3">Even princesses cannot do without Alphabets , and so in her train comes AN ALPHABET in which will be discovered many OLD and tried FRIENDS of the Nursery .</p>
    <p n="4">Thus we launch another volume of our series , like a fairy ship with a rather mixed cargo , in the hope that — to change the metaphor — like the blackbird-pie , it may prove , when opened , to be “ a pretty dish to set before — ” their Babyships .</p>

   <p>PRINCESS BELLE-ETOILE .</p>
   <p>Once upon a time there were three Princesses , named Roussette , Brunette , and Blondine , who lived in retirement with their mother , a Princess who had lost all her former grandeur . One day an old woman called and asked for a dinner , as this Princess was an excellent cook . After the meal was over , the old woman , who was a fairy , promised that their kindness should be rewarded , and immediately disappeared .</p>
   <p>Shortly after , the King came that way , with his brother and the Lord Admiral . They were all so struck with the beauty of the three Princesses , that the King married the youngest , Blondine , his brother married Brunette , and the Lord Admiral married Roussette .</p>
   <p>The good Fairy , who had brought all this about , also caused the young Queen Blondine to have three lovely children , two boys and a girl , out of whose hair fell fine jewels . Each had a brilliant star on the forehead , and a rich chain of gold around the neck . At the same time Brunette , her sister , gave birth to a handsome boy . Now the young Queen and Brunette were much attached to each other , but Roussette was jealous of both , and the old Queen , the King 's mother , hated them . Brunette died soon after the birth of her son , and the King was absent on a warlike expedition , so Roussette joined the wicked old Queen in forming plans to injure Blondine . They ordered Feintise , the old Queen 's waiting-woman , to strangle the Queen 's three children and the son of Princess Brunette , and bury them secretly . But as she was about to execute this wicked order , she was so struck by their beauty , and the appearance of the sparkling stars on their foreheads , that she shrank from the deed .</p>

   <p>So she had a boat brought round to the beach , and put the four babes , with some strings of jewels , into a cradle , which she placed in the boat , and then set it adrift . The boat was soon far out at sea . The waves rose , the rain poured in torrents , and the thunder roared . Feintise could not doubt that the boat would be swamped , and felt relieved by the thought that the poor little innocents would perish , for she would otherwise always be haunted by the fear that something would occur to betray the share she had had in their preservation .</p>
   <p>But the good Fairy protected them , and after floating at sea for seven days they were picked up by a Corsair . He was so struck by their beauty that he altered his course , and took them home to his wife , who had no children . She was transported with joy when he placed them in her hands . They admired together the wonderful stars , the chains of gold that could not be taken off their necks , and their long ringlets . Much greater was the woman 's astonishment when she combed them , for at every instant there rolled out of their hair pearls , rubies , diamonds , and emeralds . She told her husband of it , who was not less surprised than herself .</p>
   <p>“ I am very tired , ” said he , “ of a Corsair 's life , and if the locks of those little children continue to supply us with such treasures , I will give up roaming the seas . ” The Corsair 's wife , whose name was Corsine , was enchanted at this , and loved the four infants so much the more for it . She named the Princess , Belle-Etoile , her eldest brother , Petit-Soleil , the second , Heureux , and the son of Brunette , Cheri .</p>
   <p>As they grew older , the Corsair applied himself seriously to their education , as he felt convinced there was some great mystery attached to their birth .</p>
   <p>The Corsair and his wife had never told the story of the four children , who passed for their own . They were exceedingly united , but Prince Cheri entertained for Princess Belle-Etoile a greater affection than the other two . The moment she expressed a wish for anything , he would attempt even impossibilities to gratify her .</p>
   <p>One day Belle-Etoile overheard the Corsair and his wife talking . “ When I fell in with them , ” said the Corsair , “ I saw nothing that could give me any idea of their birth . ” “ I suspect , ” said Corsine , “ that Cheri is not their brother , he has neither star nor neck-chain . ” Belle-Etoile immediately ran and told this to the three Princes , who resolved to speak to the Corsair and his wife , and ask them to let them set out to discover the secret of their birth . After some remonstrance they gained their consent . A beautiful vessel was prepared , and the young Princess and the three Princes set out . They determined to sail to the very spot where the Corsair had found them , and made preparations for a grand sacrifice to the fairies , for their protection and guidance . They were about to immolate a turtle-dove , but the Princess saved its life , and let it fly . At this moment a syren issued from the water , and said , “ Cease your anxiety , let your vessel go where it will ; land where it stops . ” The vessel now sailed more quickly . Suddenly they came in sight of a city so beautiful that they were anxious their vessel should enter the port . Their wishes were accomplished ; they landed , and the shore in a moment was crowded with people , who had observed the magnificence of their ship . They ran and told the King the news , and as the grand terrace of the Palace looked out upon the sea-shore , he speedily repaired thither . The Princes , hearing the people say , “ There is the King , ” looked up , and made a profound obeisance . He looked earnestly at them , and was as much charmed by the Princess 's beauty , as by the handsome mien of the young Princes . He ordered his equerry to offer them his protection , and everything that they might require .</p>
   <p>The King was so interested about these four children , that he went into the chamber of the Queen , his mother , to tell her of the wonderful stars which shone upon their foreheads , and everything that he admired in them . She was thunderstruck at it , and was terribly afraid that Feintise had betrayed her , and sent her secretary to enquire about them . What he told her of their ages confirmed her suspicions . She sent for Feintise , and threatened to kill her . Feintise , half dead with terror , confessed all ; but promised , if she spared her , that she would still find means to do away with them . The Queen was appeased ; and , indeed , old Feintise did all she could for her own sake . Taking a guitar , she went and sat down opposite the Princess 's window , and sang a song which Belle-Etoile thought so pretty that she invited her into her chamber . “ My fair child , ” said Feintise , “ Heaven has made you very lovely , but you yet want one thing — the dancing-water . If I had possessed it , you would not have seen a white hair upon my head , nor a wrinkle on my face . Alas ! I knew this secret too late ; my charms had already faded . ” “ But where shall I find this dancing-water ? ” asked Belle-Etoile . “ It is in the luminous forest , ” said Feintise . “ You have three brothers ; does not any one of them love you sufficiently to go and fetch some ? ” “ My brothers all love me , ” said the Princess , “ but there is one of them who would not refuse me anything . ” The perfidious old woman retired , delighted at having been so successful . The Princes , returning from the chase , found Belle-Etoile engrossed by the advice of Feintise . Her anxiety about it was so apparent , that Cheri , who thought of nothing but pleasing her , soon found out the cause of it , and , in spite of her entreaties , he mounted his white horse , and set out in search of the dancing-water . When supper-time arrived , and the Princess did not see her brother Cheri , she could neither eat nor drink ; and desired he might be sought for everywhere , and sent messengers to find him and bring him back .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration ] [ Illustration ] [ Illustration ] [ Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>The wicked Feintise was very anxious to know the result of her advice ; and when she heard that Cheri had already set out , she was delighted , and reported to the Queen-Mother all that had passed . “ I admit , Madam , ” said she , “ that I can no longer doubt that they are the same four children : but one of the Princes is already gone to seek the dancing-water , and will no doubt perish in the attempt , and I shall find similar means to do away with all of them . ”</p>
   <p>The plan she had adopted with regard to Prince Cheri was one of the most certain , for the dancing-water was not easily to be obtained ; it was so notorious from the misfortunes which occurred to all who sought it , that every one knew the road to it . He was eight days without taking any repose but in the woods . At the end of this period he began to suffer very much from the heat ; but it was not the heat of the sun , and he did not know the cause of it , until from the top of a mountain he perceived the luminous forest ; all the trees were burning without being consumed , and casting out flames to such a distance that the country around was a dry desert .</p>
   <p>At this terrible scene he descended , and more than once gave himself up for lost . As he approached this great fire he was ready to die with thirst ; and perceiving a spring falling into a marble basin , he alighted from his horse , approached it , and stooped to take up some water in the little golden vase which he had brought with him , when he saw a turtle-dove drowning in the fountain . Cheri took pity on it , and saved it . “ My Lord Cheri , ” she said , “ I am not ungrateful ; I can guide you to the dancing-water , which , without me , you could never obtain , as it rises in the middle of the forest , and can only be reached by going underground . ” The Dove then flew away , and summoned a number of foxes , badgers , moles , snails , ants , and all sorts of creatures that burrow in the earth . Cheri got off his horse at the entrance of the subterranean passage they made for him , and groped his way after the kind Dove , which safely conducted him to the fountain . The Prince filled his golden vase ; and returned the same way he came .</p>
   <p>He found Belle-Etoile sorrowfully seated under some trees , but when she saw him she was so pleased that she scarcely knew how to welcome him .</p>
   <p>Old Feintise learned from her spies that Cheri had returned , and that the Princess , having washed her face with the dancing-water , had become more lovely than ever . Finding this , she lost no time in artfully making the Princess sigh for the wonderful singing-apple . Prince Cheri again found her unhappy , and again found out the cause , and once more set out on his white horse , leaving a letter for Belle-Etoile .</p>
   <p>In the meanwhile , the King did not forget the lovely children , and reproached them for never going to the Palace . They excused themselves by saying that their brother 's absence prevented them .</p>
   <p>Prince Cheri at break of day perceived a handsome young man , from whom he learned where the singing-apple was to be found : but after travelling some time without seeing any sign of it , he saw a poor turtle-dove fall at his feet almost dead . He took pity on it , and restored it , when it said , “ Good-day , handsome Cheri , you are destined to save my life , and I to do you signal service . You are come to seek for the singing-apple : it is guarded by a terrible dragon . ” The Dove then led him to a place where he found a suit of armour , all of glass : and by her advice he put it on , and boldly went to meet the dragon . The two-headed monster came bounding along , fire issuing from his throat ; but when he saw his alarming figure multiplied in the Prince 's mirrors he was frightened in his turn . He stopped , and looking fiercely at the Prince , apparently laden with dragons , he took flight and threw himself into a deep chasm . The Prince then found the tree , which was surrounded with human bones , and breaking off an apple , prepared to return to the Princess . She had never slept during his absence , and ran to meet him eagerly .</p>
   <p>When the wicked Feintise heard the sweet singing of the apple , her grief was excessive , for instead of doing harm to these lovely children , she only did them good by her perfidious counsels . She allowed some days to pass by without showing herself ; and then once more made the Princess unhappy by saying that the dancing-water and the singing-apple were useless without the little green bird that tells everything .</p>
   <p>Cheri again set out , and after some trouble learnt that this bird was to be found on the top of a frightful rock , in a frozen climate . At length , at dawn of day , he perceived the rock , which was very high and very steep , and upon the summit of it was the bird , speaking like an oracle , telling wonderful things . He thought that with a little dexterity it would be easy to catch it , for it seemed very tame . He got off his horse , and climbed up very quietly . He was so close to the green bird that he thought he could lay hands on it , when suddenly the rock opened and he fell into a spacious hall , and became as motionless as a statue ; he could neither stir , nor utter a complaint at his deplorable situation . Three hundred knights , who had made the same attempt , were in the same state . To look at each other was the only thing permitted them .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p>The time seemed so long to Belle-Etoile , and still no signs of her beloved Cheri , that she fell dangerously ill ; and in the hopes of curing her , Petit-Soleil resolved to seek him .</p>
   <p>But he too was swallowed up by the rock and fell into the great hall . The first person he saw was Cheri , but he could not speak to him ; and Prince Heureux , following soon after , met with the same fate as the other two .</p>
   <p>When Feintise was aware that the third Prince was gone , she was exceedingly delighted at the success of her plan ; and when Belle-Etoile , inconsolable at finding not one of her brothers return , reproached herself for their loss , and resolved to follow them , she was quite overjoyed .</p>
   <p>The Princess was disguised as a cavalier , but had no other armour than her helmet . She was dreadfully cold as she drew near the rock , but seeing a turtle-dove lying on the snow , she took it up , warmed it , and restored it to life : and the dove reviving , gaily said , “ I know you , in spite of your disguise ; follow my advice : when you arrive at the rock , remain at the bottom and begin to sing the sweetest song you know ; the green bird will listen to you ; you must then pretend to go to sleep ; when it sees me , it will come down to peck me , and at that moment you will be able to seize it . ”</p>
   <p>All this fell out as the Dove foretold . The green bird begged for liberty . “ First , ” said Belle-Etoile , “ I wish that thou wouldst restore my three brothers to me . ”</p>
   <p>“ Under my left wing there is a red feather , ” said the bird : “ pull it out , and touch the rock with it . ”</p>
   <p>The Princess hastened to do as she was instructed ; the rock split from the top to the bottom : she entered with a victorious air the hall in which stood the three Princes with many others ; she ran towards Cheri , who did not know her in her helmet and male attire , and could neither speak nor move . The green bird then told the Princess she must rub the eyes and mouth of all those she wished to disenchant with the red feather , which good office she did to all .</p>
   <p>The three Princes and Belle-Etoile hastened to present themselves to the King ; and when Belle-Etoile showed her treasures , the little green bird told him that the Princes Petit-Soleil and Heureux and the Princess Belle-Etoile were his children , and that Prince Cheri was his nephew . Queen Blondine , who had mourned for them all these years , embraced them , and the wicked Queen-Mother and old Feintise were justly punished . And the King , who thought his nephew Cheri the handsomest man at Court , consented to his marriage with Belle-Etoile . And lastly , to make everyone happy , the King sent for the Corsair and his wife , who gladly came .</p>
