    <docImprint>This poem , when originally published , was dedicated to Annie Fields , wife of the distinguished publisher , James T. Fields , of<settlement>Boston</settlement>, in grateful acknowledgment of the strength and inspiration I have found in her friendship and sympathy . The poem in its first form was entitled The Wife : an Idyl of Bearcamp Water , and appeared in The Atlantic Monthly for January ,<date>1868</date>. When I published the volume Among the Hills , in December of the same year , I expanded the Prelude and filled out also the outlines of the story .</docImprint>

    <head>PRELUDE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">ALONG the roadside , like the flowers of gold</l>
     <l n="2">That tawny Incas for their gardens wrought ,</l>
     <l n="3">Heavy with sunshine droops the golden-rod ,</l>
     <l n="4">And the red pennons of the cardinal-flowers</l>
     <l n="5">Hang motionless upon their upright staves .</l>
     <l n="6">The sky is hot and hazy , and the wind ,</l>
     <l n="7">Vying-weary with its long flight from the south ,</l>
     <l n="8">Unfelt ; yet , closely scanned , yon maple leaf</l>
     <l n="9">With faintest motion , as one stirs in dreams ,</l>
     <l n="10">Confesses it . The locust by the wall</l>
     <l n="11">Stabs the noon-silence with his sharp alarm .</l>
     <l n="12">A single hay-cart down the dusty road</l>
     <l n="13">Creaks slowly , with its driver fast asleep</l>
     <l n="14">On the load 's top . Against the neighboring hill ,</l>
     <l n="15">Huddled along the stone wall 's shady side ,</l>
     <l n="16">The sheep show white , as if a snowdrift still</l>
     <l n="17">Defied the dog-star . Through the open door</l>
     <l n="18">A drowsy smell of flowers-gray heliotrope ,</l>
     <l n="19">And white sweet clover , and shy mignonette —</l>
     <l n="20">Comes faintly in , and silent chorus lends</l>
     <l n="21">To the pervading symphony of peace .</l>
     <l n="22">No time is this for hands long over-worn</l>
     <l n="23">To task their strength ; and ( unto Him be praise</l>
     <l n="24">Who giveth quietness ! ) the stress and strain</l>
     <l n="25">Of years that did the work of centuries</l>
     <l n="26">Have ceased , and we can draw our breath once more</l>
     <l n="27">Freely and full . So , as yon harvesters</l>
     <l n="28">Make glad their nooning underneath the elms</l>
     <l n="29">With tale and riddle and old snatch of song ,</l>
     <l n="30">I lay aside grave themes , and idly turn</l>
     <l n="31">The leaves of memory 's sketch-book , dreaming o'er</l>
     <l n="32">Old summer pictures of the quiet hills ,</l>
     <l n="33">And human life , as quiet , at their feet .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="34">And yet not idly all . A farmer 's son ,</l>
     <l n="35">Proud of field-lore and harvest craft , and feeling</l>
     <l n="36">All their fine possibilities , how rich</l>
     <l n="37">And restful even poverty and toil</l>
     <l n="38">Become when beauty , harmony , and love</l>
     <l n="39">Sit at their humble hearth as angels sat</l>
     <l n="40">At evening in the patriarch 's tent , when man</l>
     <l n="41">Makes labor noble , and his farmer 's frock</l>
     <l n="42">The symbol of a Christian chivalry</l>
     <l n="43">Tender and just and generous to her</l>
     <l n="44">Who clothes with grace all duty ; still , I know</l>
     <l n="45">Too well the picture has another side ,—</l>
     <l n="46">How wearily the grind of toil goes on</l>
     <l n="47">Where love is wanting , how the eye and ear</l>
     <l n="48">And heart are starved amidst the plenitude</l>
     <l n="49">Of nature , and how hard and colorless</l>
     <l n="50">Is life without an atmosphere . I look</l>
     <l n="51">Across the lapse of half a century ,</l>
     <l n="52">And call to mind old homesteads , where no flower</l>
     <l n="53">Told that the spring had come , but evil weeds ,</l>
     <l n="54">Nightshade and rough-leaved burdock in the place</l>
     <l n="55">Of the sweet doorway greeting of the rose</l>
     <l n="56">And honeysuckle , where the house walls seemed</l>
     <l n="57">Blistering in sun , without a tree or vine</l>
     <l n="58">To cast the tremulous shadow of its leaves</l>
     <l n="59">Across the curtainless windows , from whose panes</l>
     <l n="60">Fluttered the signal rags of shiftlessness .</l>
     <l n="61">Within , the cluttered kitchen-floor , unwashed</l>
     <l n="62">( Broom-clean I think they called it ) ; the best room</l>
     <l n="63">Stifling with cellar damp , shut from the air</l>
     <l n="64">In hot midsummer , bookless , pictureless ,</l>
     <l n="65">Save the inevitable sampler hung</l>
     <l n="66">Over the fireplace , or a mourning piece ,</l>
     <l n="67">A green-haired woman , peony-cheeked , beneath</l>
     <l n="68">Impossible willows ; the wide-throated hearth</l>
     <l n="69">Bristling with faded pine-boughs half concealing</l>
     <l n="70">The piled-up rubbish at the chimney 's back ;</l>
     <l n="71">And , in sad keeping with all things about them ,</l>
     <l n="72">Shrill , querulous-women , sour and sullen men ,</l>
     <l n="73">Untidy , loveless , old before their time ,</l>
     <l n="74">With scarce a human interest save their own</l>
     <l n="75">Monotonous round of small economies ,</l>
     <l n="76">Or the poor scandal of the neighborhood ;</l>
     <l n="77">Blind to the beauty everywhere revealed ,</l>
     <l n="78">Treading the May-flowers with regardless feet ;</l>
     <l n="79">For them the song-sparrow and the bobolink</l>
     <l n="80">Sang not , nor winds made music in the leaves ;</l>
     <l n="81">For them in vain October 's holocaust</l>
     <l n="82">Burned , gold and crimson , over all the hills ,</l>
     <l n="83">The sacramental mystery of the woods .</l>
     <l n="84">Church-goers , fearful of the unseen Powers ,</l>
     <l n="85">But grumbling over pulpit-tax and pew-rent ,</l>
     <l n="86">Saving , as shrewd economists , their souls</l>
     <l n="87">And winter pork with the least possible outlay</l>
     <l n="88">Of salt and sanctity ; in daily life</l>
     <l n="89">Showing as little actual comprehension</l>
     <l n="90">Of Christian charity and love and duty ,</l>
     <l n="91">As if the Sermon on the Mount had been</l>
     <l n="92">Outdated like a last year 's almanac</l>
     <l n="93">Rich in broad woodlands and in half-tilled fields ,</l>
     <l n="94">And yet so pinched and bare and comfortless ,</l>
     <l n="95">The veriest straggler limping on his rounds ,</l>
     <l n="96">The sun and air his sole inheritance ,</l>
     <l n="97">Laughed at a poverty that paid its taxes ,</l>
     <l n="98">And hugged his rags in self-complacency !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="99">Not such should be the homesteads of a land</l>
     <l n="100">Where whoso wisely wills and acts may dwell</l>
     <l n="101">As king and lawgiver , in broad-acred state ,</l>
     <l n="102">With beauty , art , taste , culture , books , to make</l>
     <l n="103">His hour of leisure richer than a life</l>
     <l n="104">Of fourscore to the barons of old time ,</l>
     <l n="105">Our yeoman should be equal to his home</l>
     <l n="106">Set in the fair , green valleys , purple walled ,</l>
     <l n="107">A man to match his mountains , not to creep</l>
     <l n="108">Dwarfed and abased below them . I would fain</l>
     <l n="109">In this light way ( of which I needs must own</l>
     <l n="110">With the knife-grinder of whom Canning sings ,</l>
     <l n="111">“ Story , God bless you ! I have none to tell you ! ” )</l>
     <l n="112">Invite the eye to see and heart to feel</l>
     <l n="113">The beauty and the joy within their reach ,—</l>
     <l n="114">Home , and home loves , and the beatitudes</l>
     <l n="115">Of nature free to all . Haply in years</l>
     <l n="116">That wait to take the places of our own ,</l>
     <l n="117">Heard where some breezy balcony looks down</l>
     <l n="118">On happy homes , or where the lake in the moon</l>
     <l n="119">Sleeps dreaming of the mountains , fair as Ruth ,</l>
     <l n="120">In the old Hebrew pastoral , at the feet</l>
     <l n="121">Of Boaz , even this simple lay of mine</l>
     <l n="122">May seem the burden of a prophecy ,</l>
     <l n="123">Finding its late fulfilment in a change</l>
     <l n="124">Slow as the oak 's growth , lifting manhood up</l>
     <l n="125">Through broader culture , finer manners , love ,</l>
     <l n="126">And reverence , to the level of the hills .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="127">O Golden Age , whose light is of the dawn ,</l>
     <l n="128">And not of sunset , forward , not behind ,</l>
     <l n="129">Flood the new heavens and earth , and with thee bring</l>
     <l n="130">All the old virtues , whatsoever things</l>
     <l n="131">Are pure and honest and of good repute ,</l>
     <l n="132">But add thereto whatever bard has sung</l>
     <l n="133">Or seer has told of when in trance and dream</l>
     <l n="134">They saw the Happy Isles of prophecy</l>
     <l n="135">Let Justice hold her scale , and Truth divide</l>
     <l n="136">Between the right and wrong ; but give the heart</l>
     <l n="137">The freedom of its fair inheritance ;</l>
     <l n="138">Let the poor prisoner , cramped and starved so long ,</l>
     <l n="139">At Nature 's table feast his ear and eye</l>
     <l n="140">With joy and wonder ; let all harmonies</l>
     <l n="141">Of sound , form , color , motion , wait upon</l>
     <l n="142">The princely guest , whether in soft attire</l>
     <l n="143">Of leisure clad , or the coarse frock of toil ,</l>
     <l n="144">And , lending life to the dead form of faith ,</l>
     <l n="145">Give human nature reverence for the sake</l>
     <l n="146">Of One who bore it , making it divine</l>
     <l n="147">With the ineffable tenderness of God ;</l>
     <l n="148">Let common need , the brotherhood of prayer ,</l>
     <l n="149">The heirship of an unknown destiny ,</l>
     <l n="150">The unsolved mystery round about us , make</l>
     <l n="151">A man more precious than the gold of Ophir .</l>
     <l n="152">Sacred , inviolate , unto whom all things</l>
     <l n="153">Should minister , as outward types and signs</l>
     <l n="154">Of the eternal beauty which fulfils</l>
     <l n="155">The one great purpose of creation , Love ,</l>
     <l n="156">The sole necessity of Earth and Heaven !</l>

     <l n="1">THE Rabbi Nathan two-score years and ten</l>
     <l n="2">Walked blameless through the evil world , and then ,</l>
     <l n="3">Just as the almond blossomed in his hair ,</l>
     <l n="4">Met a temptation all too strong to bear ,</l>
     <l n="5">And miserably sinned . So , adding not</l>
     <l n="6">Falsehood to guilt , he left his seat , and taught</l>
     <l n="7">No more among the elders , but went out</l>
     <l n="8">From the great congregation girt about</l>
     <l n="9">With sackcloth , and with ashes on his head ,</l>
     <l n="10">Making his gray locks grayer . Long he prayed ,</l>
     <l n="11">Smiting his breast ; then , as the Book he laid</l>
     <l n="12">Open before him for the Bath-Col 's choice ,</l>
     <l n="13">Pausing to hear that Daughter of a Voice ,</l>

     <l n="19">Rabbi Ben Isaac , who all men excels</l>
     <l n="20">In righteousness and wisdom , as the trees</l>

     <l n="33">Before him still the old temptation came ,</l>
     <l n="34">And mocked him with the motion and the shame</l>

     <l n="75">His prayers were answered in another 's name ;</l>
     <l n="76">And , when at last they rose up to embrace ,</l>

    <head>NOREMBEGA .</head>
    <head>Norembega , or Norimbegue , is the name given by early French fishermen and explorers to a fabulous country south of Cape Breton , first discovered by Verrazzani in 1524 . It was supposed to have a magnificent city of the same name on a great river , probably the Penobscot . The site of this barbaric city is laid down on a map published at Antwerp in 1570 . In 1604 Champlain sailed in search of the Northern Eldorado , twenty-two leagues up the Penobscot from the Isle Haute . He supposed the river to be that of Norembega , but wisely came to the conclusion that those travellers who told of the great city had never seen it . He saw no evidences of anything like civilization , but mentions the finding of a cross , very old and mossy , in the woods .</head>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">THE years are many since , in youth and hope ,</l>
     <l n="2">Under the Charter Oak , our horoscope</l>
     <l n="3">We drew thick-studded with all favoring stars .</l>
     <l n="4">Now , with gray beards , and faces seamed with scars</l>
     <l n="5">From life 's hard battle , meeting once again ,</l>
     <l n="6">We smile , half sadly , over dreams so vain ;</l>
     <l n="7">Knowing , at last , that it is not in man</l>
     <l n="8">Who walketh to direct his steps , or plan</l>
     <l n="9">His permanent house of life . Alike we loved</l>
     <l n="10">The muses ’ haunts , and all our fancies moved</l>
     <l n="11">To measures of old song . How since that day</l>
     <l n="12">Our feet have parted from the path that lay</l>
     <l n="13">So fair before us ! Rich , from lifelong search</l>
     <l n="14">Of truth , within thy Academic porch</l>
     <l n="15">Thou sittest now , lord of a realm of fact ,</l>
     <l n="16">Thy servitors the sciences exact ;</l>
     <l n="17">Still listening with thy hand on Nature 's keys ,</l>
     <l n="18">To hear the Samian 's spheral harmonies</l>
     <l n="19">And rhythm of law . I called from dream and song ,</l>
     <l n="20">Thank God ! so early to a strife so long ,</l>
     <l n="21">That , ere it closed , the black , abundant hair</l>
     <l n="22">Of boyhood rested silver-sown and spare</l>
     <l n="23">On manhood 's temples , now at sunset-chime</l>
     <l n="24">Tread with fond feet the path of morning time .</l>
     <l n="25">And if perchance too late I linger where</l>
     <l n="26">The flowers have ceased to blow , and trees are bare ,</l>
     <l n="27">Thou , wiser in thy choice , wilt scarcely blame</l>
     <l n="28">The friend who shields his folly with thy name .</l>

     <l n="31">One Sabbath day my friend and I</l>
     <l n="32">After the meeting , quietly</l>
     <l n="33">Passed from the crowded village lanes ,</l>
     <l n="34">White with dry dust for lack of rains ,</l>
     <l n="35">And climbed the neighboring slope , with feet</l>
     <l n="36">Slackened and heavy from the heat ,</l>
     <l n="37">Although the day was wellnigh done ,</l>
     <l n="38">And the low angle of the sun</l>
     <l n="39">Along the naked hillside cast</l>
     <l n="40">Our shadows as of giants vast .</l>
     <l n="41">We reached , at length , the topmost swell ,</l>
     <l n="42">Whence , either way , the green turf fell</l>
     <l n="43">In terraces of nature down</l>
     <l n="44">To fruit-hung orchards , and the town</l>
     <l n="45">With white , pretenceless houses , tall</l>
     <l n="46">Church-steeples , and , o'ershadowing all ,</l>
     <l n="47">Huge mills whose windows had the look</l>
     <l n="48">Of eager eyes that ill could brook</l>
     <l n="49">The Sabbath rest . We traced the track</l>
     <l n="50">Of the sea-seeking river back ,</l>
     <l n="51">Glistening for miles above its mouth ,</l>
     <l n="52">Through the long valley to the south ,</l>
     <l n="53">And , looking eastward , cool to view ,</l>
     <l n="54">Stretched the illimitable blue</l>
     <l n="55">Of ocean , from its curved coast-line ;</l>
     <l n="56">Sombred and still , the warm sunshine</l>
     <l n="57">Filled with pale gold-dust all the reach</l>
     <l n="58">Of slumberous woods from hill to beach ,—</l>
     <l n="59">Slanted on walls of thronged retreats</l>
     <l n="60">From city toil and dusty streets ,</l>
     <l n="61">On grassy bluff , and dune of sand ,</l>
     <l n="62">And rocky islands miles from land ;</l>
     <l n="63">Touched the far-glancing sails , and showed</l>
     <l n="64">White lines of foam where long waves flowed</l>
     <l n="65">Dumb in the distance . In the north ,</l>
     <l n="66">Dim through their misty hair , looked forth</l>
     <l n="67">The space-dwarfed mountains to the sea ,</l>
     <l n="68">From mystery to mystery !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="69">So , sitting on that green hill-slope ,</l>
     <l n="70">We talked of human life , its hope</l>
     <l n="71">And fear , and unsolved doubts , and what</l>
     <l n="72">It might have been , and yet was not .</l>
     <l n="73">And , when at last the evening air</l>
     <l n="74">Grew sweeter for the bells of prayer</l>
     <l n="75">Ringing in steeples far below ,</l>
     <l n="76">We watched the people churchward go ,</l>
     <l n="77">Each to his place , as if thereon</l>
     <l n="78">The true shekinah only shone ;</l>
     <l n="79">And my friend queried how it came</l>
     <l n="80">To pass that they who owned the same</l>
     <l n="81">Great Master still could not agree</l>
     <l n="82">To worship Him in company .</l>
     <l n="83">Then , broadening in his thought , he ran</l>
     <l n="84">Over the whole vast field of man ,—</l>
     <l n="85">The varying forms of faith and creed</l>
     <l n="86">That somehow served the holders ’ need ;</l>
     <l n="87">In which , unquestioned , undenied ,</l>
     <l n="88">Uncounted millions lived and died ;</l>
     <l n="89">The bibles of the ancient folk ,</l>
     <l n="90">Through which the heart of nations spoke ;</l>
     <l n="91">The old moralities which lent</l>
     <l n="92">To home its sweetness and content ,</l>
     <l n="93">And rendered possible to bear</l>
     <l n="94">The life of peoples everywhere</l>
     <l n="95">And asked if we , who boast of light ,</l>
     <l n="96">Claim not a too exclusive right</l>
     <l n="97">To truths which must for all be meant ,</l>
     <l n="98">Like rain and sunshine freely sent .</l>
     <l n="99">In bondage to the letter still ,</l>

     <l n="102">Narrower than Peter 's house-top dream ,</l>
     <l n="103">His wisdom and his love with plans</l>
     <l n="104">Poor and inadequate as man 's .</l>
     <l n="105">It must be that He witnesses</l>
     <l n="106">Somehow to all men that He is</l>
     <l n="107">That something of His saving grace</l>
     <l n="108">Reaches the lowest of the race ,</l>
     <l n="109">Who , through strange creed and rite , may draw</l>
     <l n="110">The hints of a diviner law .</l>
     <l n="111">We walk in clearer light ;— but then ,</l>
     <l n="112">Is He not God ?— are they not men ?</l>

    <head>NAUHAUGHT , THE DEACON .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">NAUHAUGHT , the Indian deacon , who of old</l>
     <l n="2">Dwelt , poor but blameless , where his narrowing Cape</l>
     <l n="3">Stretches its shrunk arm out to all the winds</l>
     <l n="4">And the relentless smiting of the waves ,</l>
     <l n="5">Awoke one morning from a pleasant dream</l>
     <l n="6">Of a good angel dropping in his hand</l>
     <l n="7">A fair , broad gold-piece , in the name of God .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">He rose and went forth with the early day</l>
     <l n="9">Far inland , where the voices of the waves</l>
     <l n="10">Mellowed and Mingled with the whispering leaves ,</l>
     <l n="11">As , through the tangle of the low , thick woods ,</l>
     <l n="12">He searched his traps . Therein nor beast nor bird</l>
     <l n="13">He found ; though meanwhile in the reedy pools</l>
     <l n="14">The otter plashed , and underneath the pines</l>
     <l n="15">The partridge drummed : and as his thoughts went back</l>
     <l n="16">To the sick wife and little child at home ,</l>
     <l n="17">What marvel that the poor man felt his faith</l>
     <l n="18">Too weak to bear its burden ,— like a rope</l>
     <l n="19">That , strand by strand uncoiling , breaks above</l>
     <l n="20">The hand that grasps it . “ Even now , O Lord !</l>
     <l n="21">Send me , ” he prayed , “ the angel of my dream !</l>
     <l n="22">Nauhaught is very poor ; he cannot wait . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="23">Even as he spake he heard at his bare feet</l>
     <l n="24">A low , metallic clink , and , looking down ,</l>
     <l n="25">He saw a dainty purse with disks of gold</l>
     <l n="26">Crowding its silken net . Awhile he held</l>
     <l n="27">The treasure up before his eyes , alone</l>
     <l n="28">With his great need , feeling the wondrous coins</l>
     <l n="29">Slide through his eager fingers , one by one .</l>
     <l n="30">So then the dream was true . The angel brought</l>
     <l n="31">One broad piece only ; should he take all these ?</l>
     <l n="32">Who would be wiser , in the blind , dumb woods ?</l>
     <l n="33">The loser , doubtless rich , would scarcely miss</l>
     <l n="34">This dropped crumb from a table always full .</l>
     <l n="35">Still , while he mused , he seemed to hear the cry</l>
     <l n="36">Of a starved child ; the sick face of his wife</l>
     <l n="37">Tempted him . Heart and flesh in fierce revolt</l>
     <l n="38">Urged the wild license of his savage youth</l>
     <l n="39">Against his later scruples . Bitter toil ,</l>
     <l n="40">Prayer , fasting , dread of blame , and pitiless eyes</l>
     <l n="41">To watch his halting ,— had he lost for these</l>
     <l n="42">The freedom of the woods ;— the hunting-grounds</l>
     <l n="43">Of happy spirits for a walled-in heaven</l>
     <l n="44">Of everlasting psalms ? One healed the sick</l>
     <l n="45">Very far off thousands of moons ago</l>
     <l n="46">Had he not prayed him night and day to come</l>
     <l n="47">And cure his bed-bound wife ? Was there a hell ?</l>
     <l n="48">Were all his fathers ’ people writhing there —</l>
     <l n="49">Like the poor shell-fish set to boil alive —</l>
     <l n="50">Forever , dying never ? If he kept</l>
     <l n="51">This gold , so needed , would the dreadful God</l>
     <l n="52">Torment him like a Mohawk 's captive stuck</l>
     <l n="53">With slow-consuming splinters ? Would the saints</l>
     <l n="54">And the white angels dance and laugh to see him</l>
     <l n="55">Burn like a pitch-pine torch ? His Christian garb</l>
     <l n="56">Seemed falling from him ; with the fear and shame</l>
     <l n="57">Of Adam naked at the cool of day ,</l>
     <l n="58">He gazed around . A black snake lay in coil</l>
     <l n="59">On the hot sand , a crow with sidelong eye</l>
     <l n="60">Watched from a dead bough . All his Indian lore</l>
     <l n="61">Of evil blending with a convert 's faith</l>
     <l n="62">In the supernal terrors of the Book ,</l>
     <l n="63">He saw the Tempter in the coiling snake</l>
     <l n="64">And ominous , black-winged bird ; and all the while</l>
     <l n="65">The low rebuking of the distant waves</l>
     <l n="66">Stole in upon him like the voice of God</l>
     <l n="67">Among the trees of Eden . Girding up</l>
     <l n="68">His soul 's loins with a resolute hand , he thrust</l>
     <l n="69">The base thought from him : “ Nauhaught , be a man</l>
     <l n="70">Starve , if need be ; but , while you live , look out</l>
     <l n="71">From honest eyes on all men , unashamed .</l>
     <l n="72">God help me ! I am deacon of the church ,</l>
     <l n="73">A baptized , praying Indian ! Should I do</l>
     <l n="74">This secret meanness , even the barken knots</l>
     <l n="75">Of the old trees would turn to eyes to see it ,</l>
     <l n="76">The birds would tell of it , and all the leaves</l>
     <l n="77">Whisper above me : ‘ Nauhaught is a thief ! ’</l>
     <l n="78">The sun would know it , and the stars that hide</l>
     <l n="79">Behind his light would watch me , and at night</l>
     <l n="80">Follow me with their sharp , accusing eyes .</l>
     <l n="81">Yea , thou , God , seest me ! ” Then Nauhaught drew</l>
     <l n="82">Closer his belt of leather , dulling thus</l>
     <l n="83">The pain of hunger , and walked bravely back</l>
     <l n="84">To the brown fishing-hamlet by the sea ;</l>
     <l n="85">And , pausing at the inn-door , cheerily asked</l>
     <l n="86">“ Who hath lost aught to-day ? ”</l>
     <l n="87">“ I , ” said a voice ;</l>
     <l n="88">“ Ten golden pieces , in a silken purse ,</l>
     <l n="89">My daughter 's handiwork . ” He looked , and to</l>
     <l n="90">One stood before him in a coat of frieze ,</l>
     <l n="91">And the glazed bat of a seafaring man ,</l>
     <l n="92">Shrewd-faced , broad-shouldered , with no trace of wings .</l>
     <l n="93">Marvelling , he dropped within the stranger 's hand</l>
     <l n="94">The silken web , and turned to go his way .</l>
     <l n="95">But the man said : “ A tithe at least is yours ;</l>
     <l n="96">Take it in God 's name as an honest man . ”</l>
     <l n="97">And as the deacon 's dusky fingers closed</l>
     <l n="98">Over the golden gift , “ Yea , in God 's name</l>
     <l n="99">I take it , with a poor man 's thanks , ” he said .</l>
     <l n="100">So down the street that , like a river of sand ,</l>
     <l n="101">Ran , white in sunshine , to the summer sea ,</l>
     <l n="102">He sought his home singing and praising God ;</l>
     <l n="103">And when his neighbors in their careless way</l>
     <l n="104">Spoke of the owner of the silken purse —</l>
     <l n="105">A Wellfleet skipper , known in every port</l>
     <l n="106">That the Cape opens in its sandy wall —</l>
     <l n="107">He answered , with a wise smile , to himself</l>
     <l n="108">“ I saw the angel where they see a man . ”</l>

   <p>“ But now my soul with his soul I wed ; Thine the living , and mine the dead ! ” 1871 .</p>
   <p>MARGUERITE .</p>
   <p>MASSACHUSETTS BAY , 1760 .</p>
   <p>Upwards of one thousand of the Acadian peasants forcibly taken from their homes on the Gaspereau and Basin of Minas were assigned to the several towns of the Massachusetts colony , the children being bound by the authorities to service or labor .</p>
   <p>THE robins sang in the orchard , the buds into blossoms grew ; Little of human sorrow the buds and the robins knew ! Sick , in an alien household , the poor French neutral lay ; Into her lonesome garret fell the light of the April day , Through the dusty window , curtained by the spider 's warp and woof , On the loose-laid floor of hemlock , on oaken ribs of roof , The bedquilt 's faded patchwork , the teacups on the stand , The wheel with flaxen tangle , as it dropped from her sick hand .</p>
   <p>What to her was the song of the robin , or warm morning light , As she lay in the trance of the dying , heedless of sound or sight ?</p>
   <p>Done was the work of her bands , she had eaten her bitter bread ; The world of the alien people lay behind her dim and dead .</p>
   <p>But her soul went back to its child-time ; she saw the sun o'erflow With gold the Basin of Minas , and set over Gaspereau ;</p>
   <p>The low , bare flats at ebb-tide , the rush of the sea at flood , Through inlet and creek and river , from dike to upland wood ;</p>
   <p>The gulls in the red of morning , the fish-hawk 's rise and fall , The drift of the fog in moonshine , over the dark coast-wall .</p>
   <p>She saw the face of her mother , she heard the song she sang ; And far off , faintly , slowly , the bell for vespers rang .</p>
   <p>By her bed the hard-faced mistress sat , smoothing the wrinkled sheet , Peering into the face , so helpless , and feeling the ice-cold feet .</p>
   <p>With a vague remorse atoning for her greed and long abuse , By care no longer heeded and pity too late for use .</p>
   <p>Up the stairs of the garret softly the son of the mistress stepped , Leaned over the head-board , covering his face with his hands , and wept .</p>
   <p>Outspake the mother , who watched him sharply , with brow a-frown “ What ! love you the Papist , the beggar , the charge of the town ? ”</p>
   <p>Be she Papist or beggar who lies here , I know and God knows I love her , and fain would go with her wherever she goes !</p>
   <p>“ O mother ! that sweet face came pleading , for love so athirst . You saw but the town-charge ; I knew her God 's angel at first . ”</p>
   <p>Shaking her gray head , the mistress hushed down a bitter cry ; And awed by the silence and shadow of death drawing nigh ,</p>
   <p>She murmured a psalm of the Bible ; but closer the young girl pressed , With the last of her life in her fingers , the cross to her breast .</p>
   <p>“ My son , come away , ” cried the mother , her voice cruel grown . “ She is joined to her idols , like Ephraim ; let her alone ! ”</p>
   <p>But he knelt with his hand on her forehead , his lips to her ear , And he called back the soul that was passing “ Marguerite , do you hear ? ”</p>
   <p>She paused on the threshold of Heaven ; love , pity , surprise , Wistful , tender , lit up for an instant the cloud of her eyes .</p>
   <p>With his heart on his lips he kissed her , but never her cheek grew red , And the words the living long for he spake in the ear of the dead .</p>
   <p>And the robins sang in the orchard , where buds to blossoms grew ; Of the folded hands and the still face never the robins knew ! 1871 .</p>
   <p>THE ROBIN . MY old Welsh neighbor over the way Crept slowly out in the sun of spring , Pushed from her ears the locks of gray , And listened to hear the robin sing .</p>

     <l n="1">Her grandson , playing at marbles , stopped ,</l>
