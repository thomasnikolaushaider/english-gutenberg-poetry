     <p>“ Things so copied , so talked of , so pulled out of every pocket to be lent to you , so quoted , and so relished and laughed over as Doesticks ’ writings , never were launched into print . ” PLU-RI-BUS-TAH ; A SONG THATS BY NO AUTHOR — A DEED WITHOUT A NAME . Pp . 264 . 12mo . Elegantly bound in cloth . Price $ 1 00 . As a History of the country this book is invaluable , inasmuch as it notices a great many events not mentioned by Bancroft , Hildreth , or Prescott . As a Novel it is unapproachable , for it contains several characters unknown to Cooper , Dickens , Marryatt , or Bulwer . As a Mythological Work it should be immediately secured , as it makes mention of a number of gods and deified worthies hitherto unknown to old Jupiter himself . As a Poem , its claims to consideration cannot be denied , as it comprises a great many beauties not discoverable in the “ Song of Hiawatha , ” besides several Indian names which were therein omitted .

     <l n="16">I deemed it best , to set at rest ,</l>

     <l n="27">From time immemorial , people of fashion</l>

     <l n="31">And our now-a-day rhymsters , taking the cue ,</l>
     <l n="32">Have aimed all their shots at the Fifth Avenue ,</l>
     <l n="33">Till the clever author of “ Nothing to Wear , ”</l>
     <l n="34">Fired his broadside at Madison Square .</l>
     <l n="35">Now I do n't consider this sort of thing personal ,</l>
     <l n="36">I 'm not a bit of a dandy or fop ;</l>
     <l n="37">But the seed it is constantly sowing , is worse than all</l>
     <l n="38">Others , and bears a most plentiful crop ;</l>
     <l n="39">For it all goes to strengthen the popular fallacy</l>
     <l n="40">That , because a man lives in a “ brown stone palace ” he</l>
     <l n="41">Must be a miser , a rogue and a knave ,</l>
     <l n="42">Without soul enough to condemn or to save —</l>

     <l n="124">Well ! she stopped to listen , a minute or more ,</l>
     <l n="125">To the fellow 's mischievous harangue , before</l>

     <l n="130">And he smiled a smile most heavy and grim ,</l>
     <l n="131">For he thought he 'd awakened a tender passion</l>
     <l n="132">In the heart of a belle , a lady of fashion .</l>
     <l n="133">And they sat side by side , this curious pair ,</l>

     <l n="137">“ Who hath done this ? ” asked Charity then ;</l>

     <l n="147">To the Spirit , this speech was quite unexpected ,</l>

     <l n="150">She rightly concluded — he 'd Nothing to Say .</l>
     <l n="151">Then she lifted her skirts with a masterly hand ,</l>
