     <l n="3">Yet why evoke the spectres of black night</l>
     <l n="4">To blot the sunshine of exultant years ?</l>
     <l n="5">Why disinter dead faith from mouldering hidden ? 5</l>
     <l n="6">Why break the seals of mute despair unbidden ,</l>
     <l n="7">And wail life 's discords into careless ears ?</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">Because a cold rage seizes one at whiles</l>

     <l n="11">False dreams , false hopes , false masks and modes of youth ;</l>
     <l n="12">Because it gives some sense of power and passion</l>

     <l n="15">Surely I write not for the hopeful young , 15</l>

     <l n="18">The shows of life and feel nor doubt nor dearth ,</l>
     <l n="19">Or pious spirits with a God above them</l>
     <l n="20">To sanctify and glorify and love them , 20</l>

     <l n="26">If any cares for the weak words here written ,</l>

     <l n="29">Yes , here and there some weary wanderer</l>

      <l n="46">After the dewy dawning 's cold grey air :</l>
      <l n="47">The moon and stars may shine with scorn or pity 5</l>

      <l n="51">Though present in distempered gloom of thought</l>
      <l n="52">And deadly weariness of heart all day . 10</l>
      <l n="53">But when a dream night after night is brought</l>
      <l n="54">Throughout a week , and such weeks few or many</l>
      <l n="55">Recur each year for several years , can any</l>
      <l n="56">Discern that dream from real life in aught ?</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="9">
      <l n="57">For life is but a dream whose shapes return , 15</l>
      <l n="58">Some frequently , some seldom , some by night</l>
      <l n="59">And some by day , some night and day : we learn ,</l>
      <l n="60">The while all change and many vanish quite ,</l>
      <l n="61">In their recurrence with recurrent changes</l>
      <l n="62">A certain seeming order ; where this ranges 20</l>

      <l n="64">A river girds the city west and south ,</l>
      <l n="65">The main north channel of a broad lagoon ,</l>
      <l n="66">Regurging with the salt tides from the mouth ;</l>
      <l n="67">Waste marshes shine and glister to the moon 25</l>
      <l n="68">For leagues , then moorland black , then stony ridges ;</l>
      <l n="69">Great piers and causeways , many noble bridges ,</l>

      <l n="71">Upon an easy slope it lies at large</l>
      <l n="72">And scarcely overlaps the long curved crest 30</l>
      <l n="73">Which swells out two leagues from the river marge .</l>
      <l n="74">A trackless wilderness rolls north and west ,</l>
      <l n="75">Savannahs , savage woods , enormous mountains ,</l>
      <l n="76">Bleak uplands , black ravines with torrent fountains ;</l>
      <l n="77">And eastward rolls the shipless sea 's unrest . 35</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="12">
      <l n="78">The city is not ruinous , although</l>

      <l n="80">With others of a few short years ago</l>
      <l n="81">More sad , are found within its precincts vast .</l>
      <l n="82">The street-lamps always burn ; but scarce a casement 40</l>
      <l n="83">In house or palace front from roof to basement</l>
      <l n="84">Doth glow or gleam athwart the mirk air cast .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="13">
      <l n="85">The street-lamps burn amid the baleful glooms ,</l>

      <l n="87">Of ranged mansions dark and still as tombs . 45</l>
      <l n="88">The silence which benumbs or strains the sense</l>
      <l n="89">Fulfils with awe the soul 's despair unweeping :</l>

      <l n="94">So there : worn faces that look deaf and blind</l>
      <l n="95">Like tragic masks of stone . With weary tread ,</l>
      <l n="96">Each wrapt in his own doom , they wander , wander ,</l>
      <l n="97">Or sit foredone and desolately ponder 55</l>

      <l n="102">To see a little one from birth defiled , 60</l>
      <l n="103">Or lame or blind , as preordained to languish</l>
      <l n="104">Through youthless life , think how it bleeds with anguish</l>
      <l n="105">To meet one erring in that homeless wild .</l>

      <l n="109">Itself abroad ; and if at whiles it grow</l>
      <l n="110">To frenzy which must rave , none heeds the clamour ,</l>
      <l n="111">Unless there waits some victim of like glamour ,</l>
      <l n="112">To rave in turn , who lends attentive show . 70</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="17">
      <l n="113">The City is of Night , but not of Sleep ;</l>

      <l n="115">The pitiless hours like years and ages creep ,</l>
      <l n="116">A night seems termless hell . This dreadful strain</l>
      <l n="117">Of thought and consciousness which never ceases , 75</l>
      <l n="118">Or which some moments ’ stupor but increases ,</l>
      <l n="119">This , worse than woe , makes wretches there insane .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="18">
      <l n="120">They leave all hope behind who enter there :</l>
      <l n="121">One certitude while sane they cannot leave ,</l>
      <l n="122">One anodyne for torture and despair ; 80</l>
      <l n="123">The certitude of Death , which no reprieve</l>
      <l n="124">Can put off long ; and which , divinely tender ,</l>
      <l n="125">But waits the outstretched hand to promptly render</l>
      <l n="126">That draught whose slumber nothing can bereave ( 1 )</l>

   </lg>
   <p>( 1 ) Though the Garden of thy Life be wholly waste , the sweet flowers withered , the fruit-trees barren , over its wall hang ever the rich dark clusters of the Vine of Death , within easy reach of thy hand , which may pluck of them when it will .</p>

     <l n="1">Because he seemed to walk with an intent</l>
     <l n="2">I followed him ; who , shadowlike and frail ,</l>
     <l n="3">Unswervingly though slowly onward went ,</l>
     <l n="4">Regardless , wrapt in thought as in a veil :</l>
     <l n="5">Thus step for step with lonely sounding feet 5</l>
     <l n="6">We travelled many a long dim silent street .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">At length he paused : a black mass in the gloom ,</l>
     <l n="8">A tower that merged into the heavy sky ;</l>

     <l n="10">Some old God'shYpppHeNacre now corruption 's sty : 10</l>
     <l n="11">He murmured to himself with dull despair ,</l>
     <l n="12">Here Faith died , poisoned by this charnel air .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">Then turning to the right went on once more</l>

     <l n="15">And reached at last a low wall 's open door , 15</l>
     <l n="16">Whose villa gleamed beyond the foliage dense :</l>
     <l n="17">He gazed , and muttered with a hard despair ,</l>
     <l n="18">Here Love died , stabbed by its own worshipped pair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">Then turning to the right resumed his march ,</l>
     <l n="20">And travelled street and lanes with wondrous strength , 20</l>
     <l n="21">Until on stooping through a narrow arch</l>
     <l n="22">We stood before a squalid house at length :</l>
     <l n="23">He gazed , and whispered with a cold despair ,</l>
     <l n="24">Here Hope died , starved out in its utmost lair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">When he had spoken thus , before he stirred , 25</l>
     <l n="26">I spoke , perplexed by something in the signs</l>
     <l n="27">Of desolation I had seen and heard</l>
     <l n="28">In this drear pilgrimage to ruined shrines :</l>
     <l n="29">Where Faith and Love and Hope are dead indeed ,</l>
     <l n="30">Can Life still live ? By what doth it proceed ? 30</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">As whom his one intense thought overpowers ,</l>
     <l n="32">He answered coldly , Take a watch , erase</l>
     <l n="33">The signs and figures of the circling hours ,</l>
     <l n="34">Detach the hands , remove the dial-face ;</l>
     <l n="35">The works proceed until run down ; although 35</l>
     <l n="36">Bereft of purpose , void of use , still go .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">Then turning to the right paced on again ,</l>
     <l n="38">And traversed squares and travelled streets whose glooms</l>
     <l n="39">Seemed more and more familiar to my ken ;</l>
     <l n="40">And reached that sullen temple of the tombs ; 40</l>
     <l n="41">And paused to murmur with the old despair ,</l>

     <l n="43">I ceased to follow , for the knot of doubt</l>

     <l n="46">The series of the fraction left of Life ;</l>
     <l n="47">Perpetual recurrence in the scope</l>
     <l n="48">Of but three terms , dead Faith , dead Love , dead Hope . ( 1 )</l>
