  <body>
   <p>On Sunday morning , October seventh , 1849 , Reuben A. Riley and his wife , Elizabeth Marine Riley , rejoiced over the birth of their second son . They called him James Whitcomb . This was in a shady little street in the shady little town of Greenfield , which is in the county of Hancock and the state of Indiana . The young James found a brother and a sister waiting to greet him — John Andrew and Martha Celestia , and afterward came Elva May — Mrs. Henry Eitel — Alexander Humbolt and Mary Elizabeth , who , of all , alone lives to see this collection of her brother 's poems .</p>
   <p>James Whitcomb was a slender lad , with corn-silk hair and wide blue eyes . He was shy and timid , not strong physically , dreading the cold of winter , and avoiding the rougher sports of his playmates . And yet he was full of the spirit of youth , a spirit that manifested itself in the performance of many ingenious pranks . His every-day life was that of the average boy in the average country town of that day , but his home influences were exceptional . His father , who became a captain of cavalry in the Civil War , was a lawyer of ability and an orator of more than local distinction . His mother was a woman of rare strength of character combined with deep sympathy and a clear understanding . Together , they made home a place to remember with thankful heart .</p>
   <p>When James was twenty years old , the death of his mother made a profound impression on him , an impression that has influenced much of his verse and has remained with him always .</p>
   <p>At an early age he was sent to school and , “ then sent back again , ” to use his own words . He was restive under what he called the “ iron discipline . ” A number of years ago , he spoke of these early educational beginnings in phrases so picturesque and so characteristic that they are quoted in full :</p>
   <p>“ My first teacher was a little old woman , rosy and roly-poly , who looked as though she might have just come tumbling out of a fairy story , so lovable was she and so jolly and so amiable . She kept school in her little Dame-Trot kind of dwelling of three rooms , with a porch in the rear , like a bracket on the wall , which was part of the play-ground of her ‘ scholars , ’ — for in those days pupils were called ‘ scholars ’ by their affectionate teachers . Among the twelve or fifteen boys and girls who were there I remember particularly a little lame boy , who always got the first ride in the locust-tree swing during recess .</p>
   <p>“ This first teacher of mine was a mother to all her ‘ scholars , ’ and in every way looked after their comfort , especially when certain little ones grew drowsy . I was often , with others , carried to the sitting-room and left to slumber on a small made - down pallet on the floor . She would sometimes take three or four of us together ; and I recall how a playmate and I , having been admonished into silence , grew deeply interested in watching a spare old man who sat at a window with its shade drawn down . After a while we became accustomed to this odd sight and would laugh , and talk in whispers and give imitations , as we sat in a low sewing-chair , of the little old pendulating blind man at the window . Well , the old man was the gentle teacher 's charge , and for this reason , possibly , her life had become an heroic one , caring for her helpless husband who , quietly content , waited always at the window for his sight to come back to him . And doubtless it is to-day , as he sits at another casement and sees not only his earthly friends , but all the friends of the Eternal Home , with the smiling , loyal , loving little woman forever at his side .</p>
   <p>“ She was the kindliest of souls even when constrained to punish us . After a whipping she invariably took me into the little kitchen and gave me two great white slabs of bread cemented together with layers of butter and jam . As she always whipped me with the same slender switch she used for a pointer , and cried over every lick , you will have an idea how much punishment I could stand . When I was old enough to be lifted by the ears out of my seat that office was performed by a pedagogue whom I promised to ‘ whip sure , if he 'd just wait till I got big enough . ’ He is still waiting !</p>
   <p>“ There was but one book at school in which I found the slightest interest : McGuffey 's old leather-bound Sixth Reader . It was the tallest book known , and to the boys of my size it was a matter of eternal wonder how I could belong to ‘ the big class in that reader . ’ When we were to read the death of ‘ Little Nell , ’ I would run away , for I knew it would make me cry , that the other boys would laugh at me , and the whole thing would become ridiculous . I could n't bear that . A later teacher , Captain Lee O. Harris , came to understand me with thorough sympathy , took compassion on my weaknesses and encouraged me to read the best literature . He understood that he could n't get numbers into my head . You could n't tamp them in ! History I also disliked as a dry thing without juice , and dates melted out of my memory as speedily as tin-foil on a red-hot stove . But I always was ready to declaim and took natively to anything dramatic or theatrical . Captain Harris encouraged me in recitation and reading and had ever the sweet spirit of a companion rather than the manner of an instructor . ”</p>
   <p>But if there was “ only one book at school in which he found the slightest interest , ” he had before that time displayed an affection for a book — simply as such and not for any printed word it might contain . And this , after all , is the true book-lover 's love . Speaking of this incident — and he liked to refer to it as his “ first literary recollection , ” he said : “ Long before I was old enough to read I remember buying a book at an old auctioneer 's shop in Greenfield . I can not imagine what prophetic impulse took possession of me and made me forego the ginger cakes and the candy that usually took every cent of my youthful income . The slender little volume must have cost all of twenty-five cents ! It was Francis Quarles ’ Divine Emblems ,— a neat little affair about the size of a pocket Testament . I carried it around with me all day long , delighted with the very feel of it .</p>
   <p>" ‘ What have you got there , Bub ? ’ some one would ask . ‘ A book , ’ I would reply . ‘ What kind of a book ? ’ ‘ Poetry-book . ’ ‘ Poetry ! ’ would be the amused exclamation . ‘ Can you read poetry ? ’ and , embarrassed , I 'd shake my head and make my escape , but I held on to the beloved little volume . ”</p>
   <p>Every boy has an early determination — a first one — to follow some ennobling profession , once he has come to man 's estate , such as being a policeman , or a performer on the high trapeze . The poet would not have been the “ Peoples ’ Laureate , ” had his fairy god - mother granted his boy-wish , but the Greenfield baker . For to his childish mind it “ seemed the acme of delight , ” using again his own happy expression , “ to manufacture those snowy loaves of bread , those delicious tarts , those toothsome bon-bons . And then to own them all , to keep them in store , to watch over and guardedly exhibit . The thought of getting money for them was to me a sacrilege . Sell them ? No indeed . Eat ‘ em — eat ‘ em , by tray loads and dray loads ! It was a great wonder to me why the pale-faced baker in our town did not eat all his good things . This I determined to do when I became owner of such a grand establishment . Yes , sir . I would have a glorious feast . Maybe I 'd have Tom and Harry and perhaps little Kate and Florry in to help us once in a while . The thought of these play-mates as ‘ grown-up folks ’ did n't appeal to me . I was but a child , with wide-open eyes , a healthy appetite and a wondering mind . That was all . But I have the same sweet tooth to-day , and every time I pass a confectioner 's shop , I think of the big baker of our town , and Tom and Harry and the youngsters all . ”</p>
   <p>As a child , he often went with his father to the court-house where the lawyers and clerks playfully called him “ judge Wick . ” Here as a privileged character he met and mingled with the country folk who came to sue and be sued , and thus early the dialect , the native speech , the quaint expressions of his “ own people ” were made familiar to him , and took firm root in the fresh soil of his young memory . At about this time , he made his first poetic attempt in a valentine which he gave to his mother . Not only did he write the verse , but he drew a sketch to accompany it , greatly to his mother 's delight , who , according to the best authority , gave the young poet “ three big cookies and did n't spank me for two weeks . This was my earliest literary encouragement . ”</p>
   <p>Shortly after his sixteenth birthday , young Riley turned his back on the little schoolhouse and for a time wandered through the different fields of art , indulging a slender talent for painting until he thought he was destined for the brush and palette , and then making merry with various musical instruments , the banjo , the guitar , the violin , until finally he appeared as bass drummer in a brass band . “ In a few weeks , ” he said , “ I had beat myself into the more enviable position of snare drummer . Then I wanted to travel with a circus , and dangle my legs before admiring thousands over the back seat of a Golden Chariot . In a dearth of comic songs for the banjo and guitar , I had written two or three myself , and the idea took possession of me that I might be a clown , introduced as a character-song-man and the composer of my own ballads .</p>
   <p>“ My father was thinking of something else , however , and one day I found myself with a ‘ five-ought ’ paint brush under the eaves of an old frame house that drank paint by the bucketful , learning to be a painter . Finally , I graduated as a house , sign and ornamental painter , and for two summers traveled about with a small company of young fellows calling ourselves ‘ The Graphics , ’ who covered all the barns and fences in the state with advertisements . ”</p>
   <p>At another time his , young man 's fancy saw attractive possibilities in the village print-shop , and later his ambition was diverted to acting , encouraged by the good times he had in the theatricals of the Adelphian Society of Greenfield . “ In my dreamy way , ” he afterward said , “ I did a little of a number of things fairly well — sang , played the guitar and violin , acted , painted signs and wrote poetry . My father did not encourage my verse-making for he thought it too visionary , and being a visionary himself , he believed he understood the dangers of following the promptings of the poetic temperament . I doubted if anything would come of the verse-writing myself . At this time it is easy to picture my father , a lawyer of ability , regarding me , nonplused , as the worst case he had ever had . He wanted me to do something practical , besides being ambitious for me to follow in his footsteps , and at last persuaded me to settle down and read law in his office . This I really tried to do conscientiously , but finding that political economy and Blackstone did not rhyme and that the study of law was unbearable , I slipped out of the office one summer afternoon , when all out-doors called imperiously , shook the last dusty premise from my head and was away .</p>
   <p>“ The immediate instigator of my flight was a traveling medicine man who appealed to me for this reason : My health was bad , very bad ,— as bad as I was . Our doctor had advised me to travel , but how could I travel without money ? The medicine man needed an assistant and I plucked up courage to ask if I could join the party and paint advertisements for him .</p>
   <p>“ I rode out of town with that glittering cavalcade without saying good-by to any one , and though my patron was not a diplomaed doctor , as I found out , he was a man of excellent habits , and the whole company was made up of good straight boys , jolly chirping vagabonds like myself . It was delightful to bowl over the country in that way . I laughed all the time . Miles and miles of somber landscape were made bright with merry song , and when the sun shone and all the golden summer lay spread out before us , it was glorious just to drift on through it like a wisp , of thistle-down , careless of how , or when , or where the wind should anchor us . ‘ There 's a tang of gipsy blood in my veins that pants for the sun and the air . ’</p>
   <p>“ My duty proper was the manipulation of two blackboards , swung at the sides of the wagon during our street lecture and concert . These boards were alternately embellished with colored drawings illustrative of the manifold virtues of the nostrum vended . Sometimes I assisted the musical olio with dialect recitations and character sketches from the back step of the wagon . These selections in the main originated from incidents and experiences along the route , and were composed on dull Sundays in lonesome little towns where even the church bells seemed to bark at us . ”</p>
   <p>On his return to Greenfield after this delightful but profitless tour he became the local editor of his home paper and in a few months “ strangled the little thing into a change of ownership . ” The new proprietor transferred him to the literary department and the latter , not knowing what else to put in the space allotted him , filled it with verse . But there was not room in his department for all he produced , so he began , timidly , to offer his poetic wares in foreign markets . The editor of The Indianapolis Mirror accepted two or three shorter verses but in doing so suggested that in the future he try prose . Being but an humble beginner , Riley harkened to the advice , whereupon the editor made a further suggestion ; this time that he try poetry again . The Danbury ( Connecticut ) News , then at the height of its humorous reputation , accepted a contribution shortly after The Mirror episode and Mr. McGeechy , its managing editor , wrote the young poet a graceful note of congratulation . Commenting on these parlous times , Riley afterward wrote , “ It is strange how little a thing sometimes makes or unmakes a fellow . In these dark days I should have been content with the twinkle of the tiniest star , but even this light was withheld from me . Just then came the letter from McGeechy ; and about the same time , arrived my first check , a payment from Hearth and Home for a contribution called A Destiny ( now A Dreamer in A Child World ) . The letter was signed , ‘ Editor ’ and unless sent by an assistant it must have come from Ik Marvel himself , God bless him ! I thought my fortune made . Almost immediately I sent off another contribution , whereupon to my dismay came this reply : ‘ The management has decided to discontinue the publication and hopes that you will find a market for your worthy work elsewhere . ’ Then followed dark days indeed , until finally , inspired by my old teacher and comrade , Captain Lee O. Harris , I sent some of my poems to Longfellow , who replied in his kind and gentle manner with the substantial encouragement for which I had long thirsted . ”</p>
   <p>In the year following , Riley formed a connection with The Anderson ( Indiana ) Democrat and contributed verse and locals in more than generous quantities . He was happy in this work and had begun to feel that at last he was making progress when evil fortune knocked at his door and , conspiring with circumstances and a friend or two , induced the young poet to devise what afterward seemed to him the gravest of mistakes ,— the Poe-poem hoax . He was then writing for an audience of county papers and never dreamed that this whimsical bit of fooling would be carried beyond such boundaries . It was suggested by these circumstances .</p>
   <p>He was inwardly distressed by the belief that his failure to get the magazines to accept his verse was due to his obscurity , while outwardly he was harassed to desperation by the junior editor of the rival paper who jeered daily at his poetical pretensions . So , to prove that editors would praise from a known source what they did not hesitate to condemn from one unknown , and to silence his nagging contemporary , he wrote Leonainie in the style of Poe , concocting a story , to accompany the poem , setting forth how Poe came to write it and how all these years it had been lost to view . In a few words Mr. Riley related the incident and then dismissed it . “ I studied Poe 's methods . He seemed to have a theory , rather misty to be sure , about the use of ‘ m 's ’ and ‘ n 's ’ and mellifluous vowels and sonorous words . I remember that I was a long time in evolving the name Leonainie , but at length the verses were finished and ready for trial .</p>
   <p>“ A friend , the editor of The Kokomo Dispatch , undertook the launching of the hoax in his paper ; he did this with great editorial gusto while , at the same time , I attacked the authenticity of the poem in The Democrat . That diverted all possible suspicion from me . The hoax succeeded far too well , for what had started as a boyish prank became a literary discussion nation-wide , and the necessary expose had to be made . I was appalled at the result . The press assailed me furiously , and even my own paper dismissed me because I had given the ‘ discovery ’ to a rival . ”</p>
   <p>Two dreary and disheartening years followed this tragic event , years in which the young poet found no present help , nor future hope . But over in Indianapolis , twenty miles away , happier circumstances were shaping themselves . Judge E. B. Martindale , editor and proprietor of The Indianapolis Journal , had been attracted by certain poems in various papers over the state and at the very time that the poet was ready to confess himself beaten , the judge wrote : “ Come over to Indianapolis and we 'll give you , a place on The Journal . ” Mr. Riley went . That was the turning point , and though the skies were not always clear , nor the way easy , still from that time it was ever an ascending journey . As soon as he was comfortably settled in his new position , the first of the Benj . F. Johnson poems made its appearance . These dialect verses were introduced with editorial comment as coming from an old Boone county farmer , and their reception was so cordial , so enthusiastic , indeed , that the business manager of The Journal , Mr. George C. Hitt , privately published them in pamphlet form and sold the first edition of one thousand copies in local bookstores and over The Journal office counter . This marked an epoch in the young poet 's progress and was the beginning of a friendship between him and Mr. Hitt that has never known interruption . This first edition of The Old Swimmin ’ Hole and ‘ Leven More Poems has since become extremely rare and now commands a high premium . A second edition was promptly issued by a local book dealer , whose successors , The Bowen-Merrill Company — now The Bobbs-Merrill Company — have continued , practically without interruption , to publish Riley 's work .</p>
   <p>The call to read from the public platform had by this time become so insistent that Riley could no longer resist it , although modesty and shyness fought the battle for privacy . He told briefly and in his own inimitable fashion of these trying experiences . “ In boyhood I had been vividly impressed with Dickens ’ success in reading from his own works and dreamed that some day I might follow his example . At first I read at Sunday - school entertainments and later , on special occasions such as Memorial Days and Fourth of Julys . At last I mustered up sufficient courage to read in a city theater , where , despite the conspiracy of a rainy night and a circus , I got encouragement enough to lead me to extend my efforts . And so , my native state and then the country at large were called upon to bear with me and I think I visited every sequestered spot north or south particularly distinguished for poor railroad connections . At different times , I shared the program with Mark Twain , Robert J. Burdette and George Cable , and for a while my gentlest and cheeriest of friends , Bill Nye , joined with me and made the dusty detested travel almost a delight . We were constantly playing practical jokes on each other or indulging in some mischievous banter before the audience . On one occasion , Mr. Nye , coming before the foot-lights for a word of general introduction , said , ‘ Ladies and gentlemen , the entertainment to-night is of a dual nature . Mr. Riley and I will speak alternately . First I come out and talk until I get tired , then Mr. Riley comes out and talks until YOU get tired ! ’ And thus the trips went merrily enough at times and besides I learned to know in Bill Nye a man blessed with as noble and heroic a heart as ever beat . But the making of trains , which were all in conspiracy to outwit me , schedule or no schedule , and the rush and tyrannical pressure of inviolable engagements , some hundred to a season and from Boston to San Francisco , were a distress to my soul . I am glad that 's over with . Imagine yourself on a crowded day-long excursion ; imagine that you had to ride all the way on the platform of the car ; then imagine that you had to ride all the way back on the same platform ; and lastly , try to imagine how you would feel if you did that every day of your life , and you will then get a glimmer — a faint glimmer — of how one feels after traveling about on a reading or lecturing tour .</p>
   <p>“ All this time I had been writing whenever there was any strength left in me . I could not resist the inclination to write . It was what I most enjoyed doing . And so I wrote , laboriously ever , more often using the rubber end of the pencil than the point .</p>
   <p>“ In my readings I had an opportunity to study and find out for myself what the public wants , and afterward I would endeavor to use the knowledge gained in my writing . The public desires nothing but what is absolutely natural , and so perfectly natural as to be fairly artless . It can not tolerate affectation , and it takes little interest in the classical production . It demands simple sentiments that come direct from the heart . While on the lecture platform I watched the effect that my readings had on the audience very closely and whenever anybody left the hall I knew that my recitation was at fault and tried to find out why . Once a man and his wife made an exit while I was giving The Happy Little Cripple — a recitation I had prepared with particular enthusiasm and satisfaction . It fulfilled , as few poems do , all the requirements of length , climax and those many necessary features for a recitation . The subject was a theme of real pathos , beautified by the cheer and optimism of the little sufferer . Consequently when this couple left the hall I was very anxious to know the reason and asked a friend to find out . He learned that they had a little hunch-back child of their own . After this experience I never used that recitation again . On the other hand , it often required a long time for me to realize that the public would enjoy a poem which , because of some blind impulse , I thought unsuitable . Once a man said to me , ‘ Why do n't you recite When the Frost Is on the Punkin ? ’ The use of it had never occurred to me for I thought it ‘ would n't go . ’ He persuaded me to try it and it became one of my most favored recitations . Thus , I learned to judge and value my verses by their effect upon the public . Occasionally , at first , I had presumed to write ‘ over the heads ’ of the audience , consoling myself for the cool reception by thinking my auditors were not of sufficient intellectual height to appreciate my efforts . But after a time it came home to me that I myself was at fault in these failures , and then I disliked anything that did not appeal to the public and learned to discriminate between that which did not ring true to my hearers and that which won them by virtue of its truthfulness and was simply heart high . ”</p>
   <p>As a reader of his own poems , as a teller of humorous stories , as a mimic , indeed as a finished actor , Riley 's genius was rare and beyond question . In a lecture on the Humorous Story , Mark Twain , referring to the story of the One Legged Soldier and the different ways of telling it , once said :</p>
   <p>“ It takes only a minute and a half to tell it in its comic form ; and it is n't worth telling after all . Put into the humorous-story form , it takes ten minutes , and is about the funniest thing I have ever listened to — as James Whitcomb Riley tells it .</p>
   <p>“ The simplicity and innocence and sincerity and unconsciousness of Riley 's old farmer are perfectly simulated , and the result is a performance which is thoroughly charming and delicious . This is art — and fine and beautiful , and only a master can compass it . ”</p>
   <p>It was in that The Old Swimmin ’ Hole and ‘ Leven More Poems first appeared in volume form . Four years afterward , Riley made his initial appearance before a New York City audience . The entertainment was given in aid of an international copyright law , and the country 's most distinguished men of letters took part in the program . It is probably true that no one appearing at that time was less known to the vast audience in Chickering Hall than James Whitcomb Riley , but so great and so spontaneous was the enthusiasm when he left the stage after his contribution to the first day 's program , that the management immediately announced a place would be made for Mr. Riley on the second and last day 's program . It was then that James Russell Lowell introduced him in the following words :</p>
   <p>“ Ladies and gentlemen : I have very great pleasure in presenting to you the next reader of this afternoon , Mr. James Whitcomb Riley , of Indiana . I confess , with no little chagrin and sense of my own loss , that when yesterday afternoon , from this platform , I presented him to a similar assemblage , I was almost completely a stranger to his poems . But since that time I have been looking into the volumes that have come from his pen , and in them I have discovered so much of high worth and tender quality that I deeply regret I had not long before made acquaintance with his work . To-day , in presenting Mr. Riley to you , I can say to you of my own knowledge , that you are to have the pleasure of listening to the voice of a true poet . ”</p>
   <p>Two years later a selection from his poems was published in England under the title Old Fashioned Roses and his international reputation was established . In his own country the people had already conferred their highest degrees on him and now the colleges and universities — seats of conservatism — gave him scholastic recognition . Yale made him an Honorary Master of Arts in 1902 ; in 1903 , Wabash and , a year later , the University of Pennsylvania conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Letters , and in 1907 Indiana University gave him his LL . D. Still more recently the Academy of Arts and Letters elected him to membership , and in 1912 awarded him the gold medal for poetry . About this time a yet dearer , more touching tribute came to him from school children . On October 7 , 1911 , the schools of Indiana and New York City celebrated his birthday by special exercises , and one year later , the school children of practically every section of the country had programs in his honor .</p>
   <p>As these distinguished honors came they found him each time surprised anew and , though proud that they who dwell in the high places of learning should come in cap and gown to welcome him , yet gently and sincerely protesting his own unworthiness . And as they found him when they came so they left him .</p>
   <p>Mr. Riley made his home in Indianapolis from the time judge Martindale invited him to join The Journal 's forces , and no one of her citizens was more devoted , nor was any so universally loved and honored . Everywhere he went the tribute of quick recognition and cheery greeting was paid him , and his home was the shrine of every visiting Hoosier . High on a sward of velvet grass stands a dignified middle-aged brick house . A dwarfed stone wall , broken by an iron gate , guards the front lawn , while in the rear an old-fashioned garden revels in hollyhocks and wild roses . Here among his books and his souvenirs the poet spent his happy andncontented days . To reach this restful spot , the pilgrim must journey to Lockerbie Street , a miniature thoroughfare half hidden between two more commanding avenues . It is little more than a lane , shaded , unpaved and from end to end no longer than a five minutes ’ walk , but its fame is for all time .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Such a dear little street it is , nestled away</l>
     <l n="2">From the noise of the city and heat of the day ,</l>
     <l n="3">In cool shady coverts of whispering trees ,</l>
     <l n="4">With their leaves lifted up to shake hands with the breeze</l>
     <l n="5">Which in all its wide wanderings never may meet</l>
     <l n="6">With a resting-place fairer than Lockerbie Street ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Riley never married . He lived with devoted , loyal and understanding friends , a part of whose life he became many years ago . Kindly consideration , gentle affection , peace and order ,— all that go to make home home , were found here blooming with the hollyhocks and the wild roses . Every day some visitor knocked for admittance and was not denied ; every day saw the poet calling for some companionable friend and driving with him through the city 's shaded streets or far out into the country .</p>
   <p>And so his life drew on to its last and most beautiful year . Since his serious illness in 1910 , the public had shown its love for him more and more frequently . On the occasion of his birthday in 1912 , Greenfield had welcomed him home through a host of children scattering flowers . Anderson , where he was living when he first gained public recognition , had a Riley Day in 1913 .</p>
   <p>The Indiana State University entertained him the same year , as did also the city of Cincinnati . In 1915 there was a Riley Day at Columbus , Indiana , and during all this time each birthday and Christmas was marked by “ poetry-showers , ” and by thousands of letters of affectionate congratulation and by many tributes in the newspapers and magazines .</p>
   <p>His last birthday , October 7 , 1915 , was the most notable of all . Honorable Franklin K. Lane , Secretary of the Interior , suggested to the various school superintendents that one of Riley 's poems be read in each schoolhouse , with the result that Riley celebrations were general among the children of the entire country . In a proclamation by Governor Ralston the State of Indiana designated the anniversary as Riley Day in honor of its “ most beloved citizen . ” Thousands of letters and gifts from the poet 's friends poured in — letters from schools and organizations and Riley Clubs as well as from individuals — while flowers came from every section of the country . Among them all , perhaps the poet was most pleased with a bunch of violets picked from the banks of the Brandywine by the children of a Riley school .</p>
   <p>It was on this last birthday that an afternoon festival of Riley poems set to music and danced in pantomime took place at Indianapolis . This was followed at night by a dinner in his honor at which Charles Warren Fairbanks presided , and the speakers were Governor Ralston , Doctor John Finley , Colonel George Harvey , Young E. Allison , William Allen White , George Ade , Ex-Senator Beveridge and Senator Kern . That night Riley smiled his most wonderful smile , his dimpled boyish smile , and when he rose to speak it was with a perceptible quaver in his voice that he said : “ Everywhere the faces of friends , a beautiful throng of friends ! ”</p>
   <p>The winter and spring following , Riley spent quietly at Miami , Florida , where he had gone the two previous seasons to escape the cold and the rain . There was a Riley Day at Miami in February . In April , he returned home , feeling at his best , and , as if by premonition , sought out many of his friends , new and old , and took them for last rides in his automobile . A few days before the end , he visited Greenfield to attend the funeral of a dear boyhood chum , Almon Keefer , of whom he wrote in A Child-World . All Riley 's old friends who were still left in Greenfield were gathered there and to them he spoke words of faith and good cheer . Almon Keefer had “ just slipped out ” quietly and peacefully , he said , and “ it was beautiful . ”</p>
   <p>And as quietly and peacefully his own end came — as he had desired it , with no dimming of the faculties even to the very close , nor suffering , nor confronting death . This was Saturday night , July 22 , 1916 . On Monday afternoon and evening his body lay in state under the dome of Indiana 's capitol , while the people filed by , thousands upon thousands . Business men were there , and schoolgirls , matrons carrying market baskets , mothers with little children , here and there a swarthy foreigner , old folks , too , and well-dressed youths , here a farmer and his wife , and there a workman in a blue jumper with his hat in his band , silent , inarticulate , yet bidding his good-by , too . On the following day , with only his nearest and dearest about him , all that was mortal of the people 's poet was quietly and simply laid to rest .</p>

     <l n="1">As I sat smoking , alone , yesterday ,</l>

     <l n="3">Enjoying myself in a general way —</l>
     <l n="4">Allowing my thoughts a holiday</l>
     <l n="5">From weariness , toil and care ,—</l>
     <l n="6">My fancies — doubtless , for ventilation —</l>
     <l n="7">Left ajar the gates of my mind ,—</l>
     <l n="8">And Memory , seeing the situation ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">Wandering ever with tireless feet</l>

     <l n="13">Were thronging the shadowy side of the street</l>
     <l n="14">As far as the eye could see ;</l>
     <l n="15">Dreaming again , in anticipation ,</l>
     <l n="16">The same old dreams of our boyhood 's days</l>
     <l n="17">That never come true , from the vague sensation</l>
     <l n="18">Of walking asleep in the world 's strange ways .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">Away to the house where I was born !</l>
     <l n="20">And there was the selfsame clock that ticked</l>
     <l n="21">From the close of dusk to the burst of morn ,</l>
     <l n="22">When life-warm hands plucked the golden corn</l>
     <l n="23">And helped when the apples were picked .</l>
     <l n="24">And the “ chany dog ” on the mantel-shelf ,</l>
     <l n="25">With the gilded collar and yellow eyes ,</l>

     <l n="37">And again I gazed from the old schoolroom</l>

     <l n="39">When on my cheek was the hectic bloom</l>
     <l n="40">Caught of Mischief , as I presume —</l>
     <l n="41">He had such a “ partial ” way ,</l>

     <l n="43">Of a probable likelihood to be</l>

    <p>PHILIPER FLASH</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="55">Young Philiper Flash was a promising lad ,</l>
     <l n="56">His intentions were good — but oh , how sad</l>
     <l n="57">For a person to think</l>
     <l n="58">How the veriest pink</l>
     <l n="59">And bloom of perfection may turn out bad .</l>
     <l n="60">Old Flash himself was a moral man ,</l>
     <l n="61">And prided himself on a moral plan ,</l>
     <l n="62">Of a maxim as old</l>
     <l n="63">As the calf of gold ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="65">And such a good mother had Philiper Flash ;</l>
     <l n="66">Her voice was as soft as the creamy plash</l>

     <l n="68">With its musical lave</l>
     <l n="69">That gushed through the holes of her patent churn-dash ;—</l>

     <l n="71">She could cry sometimes when he stumped his toe ,—</l>
     <l n="72">And she stroked his hair</l>

     <l n="85">Young Philiper Flash , as time passed by ,</l>
     <l n="86">Grew into “ a boy with a roguish eye ":</l>
     <l n="87">He could smoke a cigar ,</l>

    <p>WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="224">There was n't two purtier farms in the state</l>
     <l n="225">Than the couple of which I 'm about to relate ;—</l>
     <l n="226">Jinin ’ each other — belongin ’ to Brown ,</l>
     <l n="227">And jest at the edge of a flourishin ’ town .</l>
     <l n="228">Brown was a man , as I understand ,</l>
     <l n="229">That allus had handled a good ‘ eal o ’ land ,</l>
     <l n="230">And was sharp as a tack in drivin ’ a trade —</l>
     <l n="231">For that 's the way most of his money was made .</l>
     <l n="232">And all the grounds and the orchards about</l>
     <l n="233">His two pet farms was all tricked out</l>
     <l n="234">With poppies and posies</l>
     <l n="235">And sweet-smellin ’ rosies ;</l>
     <l n="236">And hundreds o ’ kinds</l>
     <l n="237">Of all sorts o ’ vines ,</l>
     <l n="238">To tickle the most horticultural minds</l>
     <l n="239">And little dwarf trees not as thick as your wrist</l>
     <l n="240">With ripe apples on ‘ em as big as your fist :</l>
     <l n="241">And peaches ,— Siberian crabs and pears ,</l>
     <l n="242">And quinces — Well ! ANY fruit ANY tree bears ;</l>
     <l n="243">And th purtiest stream — jest a-swimmin ’ with fish ,</l>
     <l n="244">And — JEST O'MOST EVERYTHING HEART COULD WISH !</l>
     <l n="245">The purtiest orch'rds — I wish you could see</l>
     <l n="246">How purty they was , fer I know it ‘ ud be</l>
     <l n="247">A regular treat !— but I 'll go ahead with</l>
     <l n="248">My story ! A man by the name o ’ Smith —</l>
     <l n="249">( A bad name to rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="250">But I reckon that I 'm</l>
     <l n="251">Not goin ’ back on a Smith ! nary time ! )</l>
     <l n="252">‘ At had n't a soul of kin nor kith ,</l>
     <l n="253">And more money than he knowed what to do with ,—</l>
     <l n="254">So he comes a-ridin ’ along one day ,</l>
     <l n="255">And HE says to Brown , in his offhand way —</l>
     <l n="256">Who was trainin ’ some newfangled vines round a bay-</l>
     <l n="257">Winder — “ Howdy-do — look-a-here — say :</l>
     <l n="258">What 'll you take fer this property here ?—</l>
     <l n="259">I 'm talkin ’ o ’ leavin ’ the city this year ,</l>
     <l n="260">And I want to be</l>
     <l n="261">Where the air is free ,</l>
     <l n="262">And I 'll BUY this place , if it ai n't too dear ! ” —</l>
     <l n="263">Well — they grumbled and jawed aroun ’ —</l>
     <l n="264">“ I do n't like to part with the place , ” says Brown ;</l>
     <l n="265">“ Well , ” says Smith , a-jerkin ’ his head ,</l>
     <l n="266">“ That house yonder — bricks painted red —</l>
     <l n="267">Jest like this'n — a PURTIER VIEW —</l>
     <l n="268">Who is it owns it ? ” “ That 's mine too , ”</l>
     <l n="269">Says Brown , as he winked at a hole in his shoe ,</l>
     <l n="270">“ But I 'll tell you right here jest what I KIN do :—</l>
     <l n="271">If you 'll pay the figgers I 'll sell IT to you ., ”</l>
     <l n="272">Smith went over and looked at the place —</l>
     <l n="273">Badgered with Brown , and argied the case —</l>
     <l n="274">Thought that Brown 's figgers was rather too tall ,</l>
     <l n="275">But , findin ’ that Brown was n't goin ’ to fall ,</l>
     <l n="276">In final agreed ,</l>
     <l n="277">So they drawed up the deed</l>
     <l n="278">Fer the farm and the fixtures — the live stock an ’ all .</l>
     <l n="279">And so Smith moved from the city as soon</l>
     <l n="280">As he possibly could — But “ the man in the moon ”</l>
     <l n="281">Knowed more'n Smith o ’ farmin ’ pursuits ,</l>
     <l n="282">And jest to convince you , and have no disputes ,</l>
     <l n="283">How little he knowed ,</l>
     <l n="284">I 'll tell you his “ mode , ”</l>
     <l n="285">As he called it , o ’ raisin ’ “ the best that growed , ”</l>
     <l n="286">In the way o ’ potatoes —</l>
     <l n="287">Cucumbers — tomatoes ,</l>
     <l n="288">And squashes as lengthy as young alligators .</l>
     <l n="289">‘ Twas allus a curious thing to me</l>
     <l n="290">How big a fool a feller kin be</l>
     <l n="291">When he gits on a farm after leavin ’ a town !—</l>
     <l n="292">Expectin ’ to raise himself up to renown ,</l>
     <l n="293">And reap fer himself agricultural fame ,</l>
     <l n="294">By growin ’ of squashes — WITHOUT ANY SHAME —</l>
     <l n="295">As useless and long as a technical name .</l>
     <l n="296">To make the soil pure ,</l>
     <l n="297">And certainly sure ,</l>
     <l n="298">He plastered the ground with patent manure .</l>
     <l n="299">He had cultivators , and double-hoss plows ,</l>
     <l n="300">And patent machines fer milkin ’ his cows ;</l>
     <l n="301">And patent hay-forks — patent measures and weights ,</l>
     <l n="302">And new patent back-action hinges fer gates ,</l>
     <l n="303">And barn locks and latches , and such little dribs ,</l>
     <l n="304">And patents to keep the rats out o ’ the cribs —</l>
     <l n="305">Reapers and mowers ,</l>
     <l n="306">And patent grain sowers ;</l>
     <l n="307">And drillers</l>
     <l n="308">And tillers</l>
     <l n="309">And cucumber hillers ,</l>
     <l n="310">And horries ;— and had patent rollers and scrapers ,</l>
     <l n="311">And took about ten agricultural papers .</l>
     <l n="312">So you can imagine how matters turned out :</l>
     <l n="313">But BROWN did n't have not a shadder o ’ doubt</l>
     <l n="314">That Smith did n't know what he was about</l>
     <l n="315">When he said that “ the OLD way to farm was played out . ”</l>
     <l n="316">But Smith worked ahead ,</l>
     <l n="317">And when any one said</l>
     <l n="318">That the OLD way o ’ workin ’ was better instead</l>
     <l n="319">O ’ his “ modern idees , ” he allus turned red ,</l>
     <l n="320">And wanted to know</l>
     <l n="321">What made people so</l>
     <l n="322">INFERNALLY anxious to hear theirselves crow ?</l>
     <l n="323">And guessed that he 'd manage to hoe his own row .</l>
     <l n="324">Brown he come onc't and leant over the fence ,</l>
     <l n="325">And told Smith that he could n't see any sense</l>
     <l n="326">In goin ’ to such a tremendous expense</l>
     <l n="327">Fer the sake o ’ such no-account experiments</l>
     <l n="328">“ That 'll never make corn !</l>
     <l n="329">As shore 's you 're born</l>
     <l n="330">It 'll come out the leetlest end of the horn ! ”</l>
     <l n="331">Says Brown , as he pulled off a big roastin ’ -ear</l>
     <l n="332">From a stalk of his own</l>
     <l n="333">That had tribble outgrown</l>
     <l n="334">Smith 's poor yaller shoots , and says he , “ Looky here !</l>
     <l n="335">THIS corn was raised in the old-fashioned way ,</l>
     <l n="336">And I rather imagine that THIS corn 'll pay</l>
     <l n="337">Expenses fer RAISIN ’ it !— What do you say ? ”</l>
     <l n="338">Brown got him then to look over his crop .—</l>
     <l n="339">HIS luck that season had been tip-top !</l>
     <l n="340">And you may surmise</l>
     <l n="341">Smith opened his eyes</l>
     <l n="342">And let out a look o ’ the wildest surprise</l>
     <l n="343">When Brown showed him punkins as big as the lies</l>
     <l n="344">He was stuffin ’ him with — about offers he 's had</l>
     <l n="345">Fer his farm : “ I do n't want to sell very bad , ”</l>
     <l n="346">He says , but says he ,</l>
     <l n="347">“ Mr. Smith , you kin see</l>
     <l n="348">Fer yourself how matters is standin ’ with me ,</l>
     <l n="349">I UNDERSTAND FARMIN ’ and I 'd better stay ,</l>
     <l n="350">You know , on my farm ;— I 'm a-makin ’ it pay —</l>
     <l n="351">I ought n't to grumble !— I reckon I 'll clear</l>
     <l n="352">Away over four thousand dollars this year . ”</l>
     <l n="353">And that was the reason , he made it appear ,</l>
     <l n="354">Why he did n't care about sellin ’ his farm ,</l>
     <l n="355">And hinted at his havin ’ done himself harm</l>
     <l n="356">In sellin ’ the other , and wanted to know</l>
     <l n="357">If Smith would n't sell back ag'in to him .— So</l>
     <l n="358">Smith took the bait , and says he , “ Mr. Brown ,</l>
     <l n="359">I would n't SELL out but we might swap aroun ’ —</l>
     <l n="360">How 'll you trade your place fer mine ? ”</l>
     <l n="361">( Purty sharp way o ’ comin ’ the shine</l>
     <l n="362">Over Smith ! Was n't it ? ) Well , sir , this Brown</l>
     <l n="363">Played out his hand and brought Smithy down —</l>
     <l n="364">Traded with him an ’ , workin ’ it cute ,</l>
     <l n="365">Raked in two thousand dollars to boot</l>
     <l n="366">As slick as a whistle , an ’ that was n't all ,—</l>
     <l n="367">He managed to trade back ag'in the next fall ,—</l>
     <l n="368">And the next — and the next — as long as Smith stayed</l>
     <l n="369">He reaped with his harvests an annual trade .—</l>
     <l n="370">Why , I reckon that Brown must ‘ a ’ easily made —</l>
     <l n="371">On an AVERAGE — nearly two thousand a year —</l>
     <l n="372">Together he made over seven thousand — clear .—</l>
     <l n="373">Till Mr. Smith found he was losin ’ his health</l>
     <l n="374">In as big a proportion , almost , as his wealth ;</l>
     <l n="375">So at last he concluded to move back to town ,</l>
     <l n="376">And sold back his farm to this same Mr. Brown</l>
     <l n="377">At very low figgers , by gittin ’ it down .</l>
     <l n="378">Further'n this I have nothin ’ to say</l>
     <l n="379">Than merely advisin ’ the Smiths fer to stay</l>
     <l n="380">In their grocery stores in flourishin ’ towns</l>
     <l n="381">And leave agriculture alone — and the Browns .</l>

   <p>But as fer PATIENCE — MY ! Oomh-OOMH !— I never saw her look so sweet !— Her face was cream and roses , too ; And then them eyes o ’ heavenly blue Jest made an angel all complete ! And when she split ‘ em up in smiles And splintered ‘ em around the room , And danced acrost and met the groom , And LAUGHED OUT LOUD — It kind o ’ spiles My language when I come to that — Fer , as she laid away his hat , Thinks I , “ THE PAPERS HID INSIDE OF THAT SAID HAT MUST MAKE A BRIDE A HAPPY ONE FER ALL HER LIFE , Er else a WRECKED AND WRETCHED WIFE ! ” And , someway , then , I thought of JOHN ,— Then looked towards PATIENCE . . . . She was GONE !— The door stood open , and the rain Was dashin ’ in ; and sharp and plain Above the storm we heerd a cry — A ringin ’ , laughin ’ , loud “ Good-by ! ” That died away , as fleet and fast A hoss 's hoofs went splashin ’ past ! And that was all . ‘ Twas done that quick ! . . . You 've heerd o ’ fellers “ lookin ’ sick ” ? I wisht you 'd seen THE GROOM jest then — I wisht you 'd seen them two old men , With starin ’ eyes that fairly GLARED At one another , and the scared And empty faces of the crowd ,— I wisht you could ‘ a ’ been allowed To jest look on and see it all ,— And heerd the girls and women bawl And wring their hands ; and heerd old Jeff A-cussin ’ as he swung hisse'f Upon his hoss , who champed his bit As though old Nick had holt of it : And cheek by jowl the two old wrecks Rode off as though they 'd break their necks .</p>
   <p>And as we all stood starin ’ out Into the night , I felt the brush Of some one 's hand , and turned about , And heerd a voice that whispered , “ HUSH !— THEY 'RE WAITIN ’ IN THE KITCHEN , AND YOU 'RE WANTED . DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND ? ” Well , ef my MEMORY serves me now , I think I winked .— Well , anyhow , I left the crowd a-gawkin ’ there , And jest slipped off around to where The back door opened , and went in , And turned and shet the door ag'in , And maybe LOCKED it — could n't swear ,— A woman 's arms around me makes Me liable to make mistakes .— I read a marriage license nex ’ , But as I did n't have my specs I jest INFERRED it was all right , And tied the knot so mortal-tight That Patience and my old friend John Was safe enough from that time on !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Well , now , I might go on and tell</l>
     <l n="2">How all the joke at last leaked out ,</l>
     <l n="3">And how the youngsters raised the yell</l>
     <l n="4">And rode the happy groom about</l>
     <l n="5">Upon their shoulders ; how the bride</l>
     <l n="6">Was kissed a hunderd times beside</l>
     <l n="7">The one I give her ,— tel she cried</l>
     <l n="8">And laughed untel she like to died !</l>
     <l n="9">I might go on and tell you all</l>
     <l n="10">About the supper — and the BALL .—</l>
     <l n="11">You 'd ought to see me twist my heel</l>
     <l n="12">Through jest one old Furginny reel</l>
     <l n="13">Afore you die ! er tromp the strings</l>
     <l n="14">Of some old fiddle tel she sings</l>
     <l n="15">Some old cowtillion , do n't you know ,</l>
     <l n="16">That putts the devil in yer toe !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>We kep ’ the dancin ’ up tel FOUR O'clock , I reckon — maybe more .— We hardly heerd the thunders roar , ER THOUGHT about the STORM that blowed — AND THEM TWO FELLERS ON THE ROAD ! Tel all at onc't we heerd the door Bu'st open , and a voice that SWORE ,— And old Jeff Thompson tuck the floor . He shuck hisse'f and looked around Like some old dog about half-drowned — HIS HAT , I reckon , WEIGHED TEN POUND To say the least , and I 'll say , SHORE , HIS OVERCOAT WEIGHED FIFTY more — THE WETTEST MAN YOU EVER SAW , TO HAVE SO DRY A SON-IN-LAW !</p>

      <l n="5">And in his hand he held a wand</l>
      <l n="6">Whose magic touch gave life and thought</l>
      <l n="7">Unto a form his fancy wrought</l>
      <l n="8">And robed with coloring so grand ,</l>
      <l n="9">It seemed the reflex of some child</l>
      <l n="10">Of Heaven , fair and undefiled —</l>
      <l n="11">A face of purity and love —</l>
      <l n="12">To woo him into worlds above :</l>
      <l n="13">And as I gazed with dazzled eyes ,</l>
      <l n="14">A gleaming smile lit up his lips</l>
      <l n="15">As his bright soul from its eclipse</l>
      <l n="16">Went flashing into Paradise .</l>
      <l n="17">Then tardy Fame came through the door</l>
      <l n="18">And found a picture — nothing more .</l>

      <l n="185">Upon thy threshold . And again</l>
      <l n="186">When newer wars were bred , and men</l>
      <l n="187">Went marching in the cannon 's breath</l>
      <l n="188">And died for thee and loved the death ,</l>
      <l n="189">While , high above them , gleaming bright ,</l>
      <l n="190">The dear old flag remained in sight ,</l>
      <l n="191">And lighted up their dying eyes</l>
      <l n="192">With smiles that brightened paradise .</l>
      <l n="193">O Liberty , it is thy power</l>
      <l n="194">To gladden us in every hour</l>
      <l n="195">Of gloom , and lead us by thy hand</l>
      <l n="196">As little children through a land</l>
      <l n="197">Of bud and blossom ; while the days</l>
      <l n="198">Are filled with sunshine , and thy praise</l>
      <l n="199">Is warbled in the roundelays</l>
      <l n="200">Of joyous birds , and in the song</l>
      <l n="201">Of waters , murmuring along</l>
      <l n="202">The paths of peace , whose flowery fringe</l>
      <l n="203">Has roses finding deeper tinge</l>
      <l n="204">Of crimson , looking on themselves</l>
      <l n="205">Reflected — leaning from the shelves</l>
      <l n="206">Of cliff and crag and mossy mound</l>
      <l n="207">Of emerald splendor shadow-drowned .—</l>
      <l n="208">We hail thy presence , as you come</l>
      <l n="209">With bugle blast and rolling drum ,</l>
      <l n="210">And booming guns and shouts of glee</l>
      <l n="211">Commingled in a symphony</l>
      <l n="212">That thrills the worlds that throng to see</l>
      <l n="213">The glory of thy pageantry .</l>
      <l n="214">0And with thy praise , we breathe a prayer</l>
      <l n="215">That God who leaves you in our care</l>
      <l n="216">May favor us from this day on</l>
      <l n="217">With thy dear presence — till the dawn</l>
      <l n="218">Of Heaven , breaking on thy face ,</l>
      <l n="219">Lights up thy first abiding place .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Tom Van Arden , my old friend ,</l>
     <l n="2">Our warm fellowship is one</l>
     <l n="3">Far too old to comprehend</l>
     <l n="4">Where its bond was first begun :</l>
     <l n="5">Mirage-like before my gaze</l>
     <l n="6">Gleams a land of other days ,</l>
     <l n="7">Where two truant boys , astray ,</l>
     <l n="8">Dream their lazy lives away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">There 's a vision , in the guise</l>
     <l n="10">Of Midsummer , where the Past</l>
     <l n="11">Like a weary beggar lies</l>
     <l n="12">In the shadow Time has cast ;</l>
     <l n="13">And as blends the bloom of trees</l>
     <l n="14">With the drowsy hum of bees ,</l>
     <l n="15">Fragrant thoughts and murmurs blend ,</l>
     <l n="16">Tom Van Arden , my old friend .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Tom Van Arden , my old friend ,</l>
     <l n="18">All the pleasures we have known</l>
     <l n="19">Thrill me now as I extend</l>
     <l n="20">This old hand and grasp your own —</l>
     <l n="21">Feeling , in the rude caress ,</l>
     <l n="22">All affection 's tenderness ;</l>
     <l n="23">Feeling , though the touch be rough ,</l>
     <l n="24">Our old souls are soft enough .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">So we 'll make a mellow hour :</l>
     <l n="26">Fill your pipe , and taste the wine —</l>
     <l n="27">Warp your face , if it be sour ,</l>
     <l n="28">I can spare a smile from mine ;</l>
     <l n="29">If it sharpen up your wit ,</l>
     <l n="30">Let me feel the edge of it —</l>
     <l n="31">I have eager ears to lend ,</l>
     <l n="32">Tom Van Arden , my old friend .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">Tom Van Arden , my old friend ,</l>
     <l n="34">Are we “ lucky dogs , ” indeed ?</l>
     <l n="35">Are we all that we pretend</l>
     <l n="36">In the jolly life we lead ?—</l>
     <l n="37">Bachelors , we must confess ,</l>
     <l n="38">Boast of “ single blessedness ”</l>
     <l n="39">To the world , but not alone —</l>
     <l n="40">Man 's best sorrow is his own !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">And the saddest truth is this ,—</l>
     <l n="42">Life to us has never proved</l>
     <l n="43">What we tasted in the kiss</l>
     <l n="44">Of the women we have loved :</l>
     <l n="45">Vainly we congratulate</l>
     <l n="46">Our escape from such a fate</l>
     <l n="47">As their lying lips could send ,</l>
     <l n="48">Tom Van Arden , my old friend !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="49">Tom Van Arden , my old friend ,</l>
     <l n="50">Hearts , like fruit upon the stem ,</l>
     <l n="51">Ripen sweetest , I contend ,</l>
     <l n="52">As the frost falls over them :</l>
     <l n="53">Your regard for me to-day</l>
     <l n="54">Makes November taste of May ,</l>
     <l n="55">And through every vein of rhyme</l>
     <l n="56">Pours the blood of summer-time .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="57">When our souls are cramped with youth</l>
     <l n="58">Happiness seems far away</l>
     <l n="59">In the future , while , in truth ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="60">We look back on it to-day</l>
     <l n="61">Through our tears , nor dare to boast ,—</l>
     <l n="62">“ Better to have loved and lost ! ”</l>
     <l n="63">Broken hearts are hard to mend ,</l>

     <l n="65">Tom Van Arden , my old friend ,</l>
     <l n="66">I grow prosy , and you tire ;</l>
     <l n="67">Fill the glasses while I bend</l>
     <l n="68">To prod up the failing fire . . . .</l>
     <l n="69">You are restless :— I presume</l>
     <l n="70">There 's a dampness in the room .—</l>
     <l n="71">Much of warmth our nature begs ,</l>
     <l n="72">With rheumatics in our legs ! . . .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Humph ! the legs we used to fling Limber-jointed in the dance , When we heard the fiddle ring Up the curtain of Romance , And in crowded public halls Played with hearts like jugglers ’ balls .— FEATS OF MOUNTEBANKS , DEPEND !— Tom Van Arden , my old friend .</p>

     <l n="1">Tom Van Arden , my old friend ,</l>
     <l n="2">Pardon , then , this theme of mine :</l>
     <l n="3">While the firelight leaps to lend</l>
     <l n="4">Higher color to the wine ,—</l>
     <l n="5">I propose a health to those</l>
     <l n="6">Who have HOMES , and home 's repose ,</l>
     <l n="7">Wife- and child-love without end !</l>
