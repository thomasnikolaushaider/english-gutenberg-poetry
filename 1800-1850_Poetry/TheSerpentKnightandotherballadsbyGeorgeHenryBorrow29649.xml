    <docTitle><titlePart>THE SERPENT KNIGHT Signelil sits in her bower alone , Of her golden harp she waked the tone . Beneath her mantle her harp she played , Then in came striding the worm so laid . “ Proud Signelil , if thou me wilt wed , I ’ ll give thee store of gold so red .” “ Forbid the heavenly God so great That I should become the Lindworm ’ s mate .” “ Since thee I may not for a wife acquire , Kiss me only and I ’ ll retire .” The linen so white betwixt she placed , And the laidly worm she kissed in haste . With his tail of serpent up strook he , From beneath her dress the blood ran free . The Lindworm down from the chamber strode , Wringing her hands behind she trode . And when she came out upon the stair Her seven bold brothers met her there . “ Welcome our sister , whither dost hie ? Keep ’ st thou the Lindworm company ?” “ Ah , yes ! with the laidly worm I go , Because hard fate will have it so .” The Lindworm into the mountain strode , Wringing her hands behind she trode . She fell on her knee , and her prayer she made , “ Now son of Mary deign to aid .” And when he had come to the mountain in , Off he cast his serpent ’ s skin . His snake ’ s appearance off he shook , And the form of a stately knight he took . “ Thanks for thy trouble , proud Signelil , Now live and die with thee I will .” Now is proud Signild free from fright , In a prince ’ s arm she sleeps each night .</titlePart></docTitle>

     <p>Note .— The above Ballad is a later , and greatly improved , version of one which appeared under the title The Merman only , in the Romantic Ballads of 1826 . The introduction of the incident of the changing by magic of the horse into a boat , furnishes a reason for the catastrophe which was lacking in the earlier version .</p>
