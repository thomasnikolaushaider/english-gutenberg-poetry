    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">With deep reverence I inscribe these lines , my dear parents , to you . I see you now , away beyond the seas , beyond the lands where the sun goes down in the Pacific like some great ship of fire , resting still on the green hills , watching your herds , waiting</p>
    <p n="2">“ Where rolls the Oregon , And hears no sound save its own dashing . ”</p>
    <p n="3">Nearly a quarter of a century ago you took me the long and lonesome half-year 's journey across the mighty continent , wild , and rent , and broken up , and sown with sand and ashes , and crossed by tumbling , wooded rivers that ran as if glad to get away , fresh and strange and new as if but half-fashioned from the hand of God .</p>
    <p n="4">All the time as I tread this strange land I re-live those scenes , and you are with me . How dark and deep , how sullen , strong , and lion-like the mighty Missouri rolled between his walls of untracked wood and cleft the unknown domain of the middle world before us !</p>
    <p n="5">Then the frail and buffeted rafts on the river , the women and children huddled together , the shouts of the brawny men as they swam with the bellowing cattle ; the cows in the stormy stream , eddying , whirling , spinning about , calling to their young , their bright horns shining in the sun .... The wild men waiting on the other side , painted savages leaning silent on their bows , despising our weakness , opening a way , letting us pass on to the unknown distances , where they said the sun and moon lay down together and brought forth the stars .... The long and winding lines of wagons , the graves by the wayside , the women weeping together as they passed on . Then hills , then plains , parched lands like Syria , dust , and ashes , and alkali , cool streams with woods , camps by night , great wood fires in circles , tents in the centre like Caesar 's battle-camps , painted men that passed like shadows , showers of arrows , the wild beasts howling from the hill ....</p>
    <p n="6">You , my dear parents , will pardon the thread of fiction on which I have strung these scenes and descriptions of a mighty land of mystery , and wild and savage grandeur , for the world will have its way , and , like a spoiled child , demands a tale .</p>
    <p n="7">“ Yea , We who toil and earn our bread Still have our masters .... ”</p>
    <p n="8">A ragged and broken story it is , with long deserts , with alkali and ashes , yet it may , like the land it deals of , have some green places , and woods , and running waters , where you can rest ....</p>
    <p n="9">Three times now I have ranged the great West in fancy , as I did in fact for twenty years , and gathered unknown and unnamed blossoms from mountain-top , from desert level , where man never ranged before , and asked the world to receive my weeds , my grasses , and blue-eyed blossoms . But here it ends . Good or bad , I have done enough of this work on the border . The Orient promises a more grateful harvest .</p>
    <p n="10">I have been true to my West . She has been my only love . I have remembered her greatness . I have done my work to show to the world her vastness , her riches , her resources , her valor and her dignity , her poetry and her grandeur . Yet while I was going on , working so in silence , what were the things she said of me ? But let that pass , my dear parents . Others will come after us . Possibly I have blazed out the trail for great minds over this field , as you did across the deserts and plains for great men a quarter of a century ago .</p>

     <l n="1">A Man in middle Aridzone</l>
     <l n="2">Stood by the desert 's edge alone ,</l>
     <l n="3">And long he look 'd , and lean 'd . He peer 'd ,</l>
     <l n="4">Above his twirl 'd and twisted beard ,</l>
     <l n="5">Beneath his black and slouchy hat ...</l>
     <l n="6">Nay , nay , the tale is not of that .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">A skin-clad trapper , toe-a-tip ,</l>
     <l n="8">Stood on a mountain top , and he</l>
     <l n="9">Look 'd long and still and eagerly .</l>
     <l n="10">“ It looks so like some lonesome ship</l>
     <l n="11">That sails this ghostly lonely sea ,—</l>
     <l n="12">This dried-up desert sea , ” said he ,</l>
     <l n="13">“ These tawny sands of Arazit ” ...</l>
     <l n="14">Avaunt ! the tale is not of it .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">A chief from out the desert 's rim</l>
     <l n="16">Rode swift as twilight swallows swim ,</l>
     <l n="17">Or eagle blown from eyrie nest .</l>
     <l n="18">His trim-limb 'd steed was black as night ,</l>
     <l n="19">His long black hair had blossom 'd white ,</l>
     <l n="20">With feathers from the koko 's crest ;</l>
     <l n="21">His iron face was flush 'd and red ,</l>
     <l n="22">His eyes flash 'd fire as he fled ,</l>
     <l n="23">For he had seen unsightly things ;</l>
     <l n="24">Had felt the flapping of their wings .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">A wild and wiry man was he ,</l>
     <l n="26">This tawny chief of Shoshonee ;</l>
     <l n="27">And O his supple steed was fleet !</l>
     <l n="28">About his breast flapp 'd panther skins ,</l>
     <l n="29">About his eager flying feet</l>
     <l n="30">Flapp 'd beaded , braided moccasins :</l>
     <l n="31">He rode as rides the hurricane ;</l>
     <l n="32">He seem 'd to swallow up the plain ;</l>
     <l n="33">He rode as never man did ride ,</l>
     <l n="34">He rode , for ghosts rode at his side ,</l>
     <l n="35">And on his right a grizzled grim —</l>
     <l n="36">No , no , this tale is not of him .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="37">An Indian warrior lost his way</l>
     <l n="38">While prowling on this desert 's edge</l>
     <l n="39">In fragrant sage and prickly hedge ,</l>
     <l n="40">When suddenly he saw a sight ,</l>
     <l n="41">And turn 'd his steed in eager flight .</l>
     <l n="42">He rode right through the edge of day ,</l>
     <l n="43">He rode into the rolling night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="44">He lean 'd , he reach 'd an eager face ,</l>
     <l n="45">His black wolf skin flapp 'd out and in ,</l>
     <l n="46">And tiger claws on tiger skin</l>
     <l n="47">Held seat and saddle to its place ;</l>
     <l n="48">But that gray ghost that clutch 'd thereat ...</l>
     <l n="49">Arrete ! the tale is not of that .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="50">A chieftain touch 'd the desert 's rim</l>
     <l n="51">One autumn eve : he rode alone</l>
     <l n="52">And still as moon-made shadows swim .</l>
     <l n="53">He stopp 'd , he stood as still as stone ,</l>
     <l n="54">He lean 'd , he look 'd , there glisten 'd bright</l>
     <l n="55">From out the yellow yielding sand</l>
     <l n="56">A golden cup with jewell 'd rim .</l>
     <l n="57">He lean 'd him low , he reach 'd a hand ,</l>
     <l n="58">He caught it up , he gallop 'd on ,</l>
     <l n="59">He turn 'd his head , he saw a sight ...</l>
     <l n="60">His panther skins flew to the wind ,</l>
     <l n="61">The dark , the desert lay behind ;</l>
     <l n="62">The tawny Ishmaelite was gone ;</l>
     <l n="63">But something sombre as death is ...</l>
     <l n="64">Tut , tut ! the tale is not of this .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="65">A mountaineer , storm-stained and brown ,</l>
     <l n="66">From farthest desert touched the town ,</l>
     <l n="67">And , striding through the crowd , held up</l>
     <l n="68">Above his head a jewell 'd cup .</l>
     <l n="69">He put two fingers to his lip ,</l>
     <l n="70">He whisper 'd wild , he stood a-tip ,</l>
     <l n="71">And lean 'd the while with lifted hand ,</l>
     <l n="72">And said , “ A ship lies yonder dead , ”</l>
     <l n="73">And said , “ Doubloons lie sown in sand</l>
     <l n="74">In yon far desert dead and brown ,</l>
     <l n="75">Beyond where wave-wash 'd walls look down ,</l>
     <l n="76">As thick as stars set overhead .</l>
     <l n="77">That three shipmasts uplift like trees ” ...</l>
     <l n="78">Away ! the tale is not of these .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="79">An Indian hunter held a plate</l>
     <l n="80">Of gold above his lifted head ,</l>
     <l n="81">Around which kings had sat in state ...</l>
     <l n="82">“ ‘ Tis from that desert ship , ” they said ,</l>
     <l n="83">“ That sails with neither sail nor breeze ,</l>
     <l n="84">Or galleon , that sank below</l>
     <l n="85">Of old , in olden dried-up seas ,</l>
     <l n="86">Ere yet the red men drew the bow . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="87">But wrinkled women wagg 'd the head ,</l>
     <l n="88">And walls of warriors sat that night</l>
     <l n="89">In black , nor streak of battle red ,</l>
     <l n="90">Around against the red camp light ,</l>
     <l n="91">And told such wondrous tales as these</l>
     <l n="92">Of wealth within their dried-up seas .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="93">And one , girt well in tiger 's skin ,</l>
     <l n="94">Who stood , like Saul , above the rest ,</l>
     <l n="95">With dangling claws about his breast ,</l>
     <l n="96">A belt without , a blade within ,</l>
     <l n="97">A warrior with a painted face ,</l>
     <l n="98">And lines that shadow 'd stern and grim ,</l>
     <l n="99">Stood pointing east from his high place ,</l>
     <l n="100">And hurling thought like cannon shot ,</l>
     <l n="101">Stood high with visage flush 'd and hot ...</l>
     <l n="102">But , stay ! this tale is not of him .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="13">
      <l n="107">They tented in a cannon 's mouth</l>
      <l n="108">That gaped against the warm wide south ,</l>
      <l n="109">And underneath a wave-wash 'd wall ,</l>
      <l n="110">Where now nor rains nor winds may fall ,</l>
      <l n="111">They delved the level salt-white sands</l>

      <l n="127">The miner twisted , twirled his beard ,</l>
      <l n="128">Lean 'd on his pick-axe as he spoke :</l>
