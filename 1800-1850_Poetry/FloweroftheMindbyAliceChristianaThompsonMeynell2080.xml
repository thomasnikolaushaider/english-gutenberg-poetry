    <head>ALICE MEYNELL 'S COMMENTS / NOTES</head>
    <head>EPITHALAMION</head>
    <head>Written by Spensor on his marriage in Ireland , Elizabeth Boyle of Kilcoran , who survived him , married one Roger Seckerstone , and was again a widow . Dr. Grosart seems to have finally decided the identity of the heroine of this great poem . It is worth while to explain , once for all , that I do not use the accented e for the longer pronunciation of the past participle . The accent is not an English sign , and , to my mind , disfigures the verse ; neither do I think it necessary to cut off the e with an apostrophe when the participle is shortened . The reader knows at a glance how the word is to be numbered ; besides , he may have his preferences where choice is allowed . In reading such a line as Tennyson 's</head>
     <l n="1">“ Dear as remembered kisses after death , ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>one man likes the familiar sound of the word “ remembered ” as we all speak it now ; another takes pleasure in the four light syllables filling the line so full . Tennyson uses the apostrophe as a rule , but neither he nor any other author is quite consistent .</p>
   <p>ROSALYND 'S MADRIGAL</p>
   <p>It may please the reader to think that this frolic , rich , and delicate singer was Shakespeare 's very Rosalind . From Dr. Thomas Lodge 's novel , Euphues ’ Golden Legacy , was taken much of the story , with some of the characters , and some few of the passages , of As You Like It .</p>
   <p>ROSALINE</p>
   <p>This splendid poem ( from the same romance ) , written on the poet 's voyage to the Islands of Terceras and the Canaries , has the fire and freshness of the south and the sea ; all its colours are clear . The reader 's ear will at once teach him to read the sigh “ heigh ho ” so as to give the first syllable the time of two ( long and short ) .</p>
   <p>FAREWELL TO ARMS</p>
   <p>George Peele 's four fine stanzas ( which must be mentioned as dedicated to Queen Elizabeth , but are better without that dedication ) exist in another form , in the first person , and with some archaisms smoothed . But the third person seems to be far more touching , the old man himself having done with verse .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE PASSIONATE SHEPHERD</head>
     <l n="1">The sixth stanza is perhaps by Izaak Walton .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>TAKE , O TAKE THOSE LIPS AWAY</p>
   <p>The author of this exquisite song is by no means certain . The second stanza is not with the first in Shakespeare , but it is in Beaumont and Fletcher .</p>
   <p>KIND ARE HER ANSWERS</p>
   <p>These verses are a more subtle experiment in metre by the musician and poet , Campion , than even the following , Laura , which he himself sweetly commended as “ voluble , and fit to express any amorous conceit . ” In Kind are her Answers the long syllables and the trochaic movement of the short lines meet the contrary movement of the rest , with an exquisite effect of flux and reflux . The “ dancers ” whose time they sang must have danced ( with Perdita ) like “ a wave of the sea . ”</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>DIRGE</head>
     <l n="1">I have followed the usual practice in omitting the last and less</l>
     <l n="2">beautiful stanza .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>FOLLOW</head>
    <head>Campion 's “ airs , ” for which he wrote his words , laid rules too urgent upon what would have been a delicate genius in poetry . The airs demanded so many stanzas ; but they gave his imagination leave to be away , and they depressed and even confused his metrical play , hurting thus the two vital spots of poetry . Many of the stanzas for music make an unlucky repeating pattern with the poor variety that a repeating wall-paper does not attempt . And yet Campion began again and again with the onset of a true poet . Take , for example , the poem beginning with the vitality of this line , “ touching in its majesty ” -</head>
     <l n="1">“ Awake , thou spring of speaking grace ; mute rest becomes not thee ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Who would have guessed that the piece was to close in a jogging stanza containing a reflection on the fact that brutes are speechless , with these two final lines -</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ If speech be then the best of graces ,</l>
     <l n="2">Doe it not in slumber smother ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">Campion yields a curious collection of beautiful first lines .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">“ Sleep , angry beauty , sleep and fear not me ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="5">is far finer than anything that follows . So is there a single</l>
     <l n="6">gloom in this -</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="7">“ Follow thy fair sun , unhappy shadow ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="8">And a single joy in this -</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="9">“ Oh , what unhoped-for sweet supply ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="10">Another solitary line is one that by its splendour proves Campion</l>
     <l n="11">the author of Cherry Ripe -</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="12">“ A thousand cherubim fly in her looks . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>And yet “ a thousand cherubim ” is a line of a poem full of the dullest kind of reasoning — curious matter for music — and of the intricate knotting of what is a very simple thread of thought . It was therefore no easy matter to choose something of Campion 's for a collection of the finest work . For an historical book of representative poetry the question would be easy enough , for there Campion should appear by his glorious lyric , Cherry Ripe , by one or two poems of profounder imagination ( however imperfect ) , and by a madrigal written for the music ( however the stanzas may flag in their quibbling ) . But the work of choosing among his lyrics for the sake of beauty shows too clearly the inequality , the brevity of the inspiration , and the poet 's absolute disregard of the moment of its flight and departure . A few splendid lines may be reason enough for extracting a short poem , but must not be made to bear too great a burden .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>WHEN THOU MUST HOME</head>
    <head>Of the quality of this imaginative lyric there is no doubt . It is fine throughout , as we confess even after the greatness of the opening : -</head>
     <l n="1">“ When thou must home to shades of underground ,</l>
     <l n="2">And there arrived , a new admired guest — ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It is as solemn and fantastic at the close as at this dark and splendid opening , and throughout , past description , Elizabethan . This single poem must bind Campion to that period without question ; and as he lived thirty-six years in the actual reign of Elizabeth , and printed his Book of Airs with Rosseter two years before her death , it is by no violence that we give him the name that covers our earlier poets of the great age . When thou must Home is of the day of Marlowe . It has the qualities of great poetry , and especially the quality of keeping its simplicity ; and it has a quality of great simplicity not at all child-like , but adult , large , gay , credulous , tragic , sombre , and amorous .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE FUNERAL</head>
    <head>Donne , too , is a poet of fine onsets . It was with some hesitation that I admitted a poem having the middle stanza of this Funeral ; but the earlier lines of the last are fine .</head>
    <head>CHARIS ’ TRIUMPH</head>
    <head>The freshest of Ben Jonson 's lyrics have been chosen . Obviously it is freshness that he generally lacks , for all his vigour , his emphatic initiative , and his overbearing and impulsive voice in verse . There is a stale breath in that hearty shout . Doubtless it is to the credit of his honesty that he did not adopt the country - phrases in vogue ; but when he takes landscape as a task the effect is ill enough . I have already had the temerity to find fault for a blunder of meaning , with the passage of a most famous lyric , where it says the contrary of what it would say -</head>
     <l n="1">“ But might I of Jove 's nectar sup</l>
     <l n="2">I would not change for thine ; ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>and for doing so have encountered the anger rather than the argument of those who cannot admire a pretty lyric but they must hold reason itself to be in error rather than allow that a line of it has chanced to get turned in the rhyming .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>IN EARTH</head>
    <head>“ I ever saw anything , ” says Charles Lamb , “ like this funeral dirge , except the ditty which reminds Ferdinand of his drowned father in the Tempest . As that is of the water , watery ; so this is of the earth , earthy . Both have that intentness of feeling which seems to resolve itself into the element which it contemplates . ”</head>
     <l n="1">SONG ( Phoebus , arise ! )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>All Drummond 's poems seem to be minor poems , even at their finest , except only this . He must have known , for the creation of that poem , some more impassioned and less restless hour . It is , from the outset to the close , the sigh of a profound expectation . There is no division into stanzas , because its metre is the breath of life . One might wish that the English ode ( roughly called “ Pindaric ” ) had never been written but with passion , for so written it is the most immediate of all metres ; the shock of the heart and the breath of elation or grief are the law of the lines . It has passed out of the gates of the garden of stanzas , and walks ( not astray ) in the further freedom where all is interior law . Cowley , long afterwards , wrote this Pindaric ode , and wrote it coldly . But Drummond 's ( he calls it a song ) can never again be forgotten . With admirable judgment it was set up at the very gate of that Golden Treasury we all know so well ; and , therefore , generation after generation of readers , who have never opened Drummond 's poems , know this fine ode as well as they know any single poem in the whole of English literature . There was a generation that had not been taught by the Golden Treasury , and Cardinal Newman was of it . Writing to Coventry Patmore of his great odes , he called them beautiful but fragmentary ; was inclined to wish that they might some day be made complete . There is nothing in all poetry more complete . Seldom is a poem in stanzas so complete but that another stanza might have made a final close ; but a master 's ode has the unity of life , and when it ends it ends for ever .</p>
   <p>A poem of Drummond 's has this auroral image of a blush : Anthea has blushed to hear her eyes likened to stars ( habit might have caused her , one would think , to bear the flattery with a front as cool as the very daybreak ) , and the lover tells her that the sudden increase of her beauty is futile , for he cannot admire more : “ For naught thy cheeks that morn do raise . ” What sweet , nay , what solemn roses !</p>
   <p>Again :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Me here she first perceived , and here a morn</l>
     <l n="2">Of bright carnations overspread her face . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The seventeenth century has possession of that “ morn ” caught once upon its uplands ; nor can any custom of aftertime touch its freshness to wither it .</p>
   <p>TO MY INCONSTANT MISTRESS</p>
   <p>The solemn vengeance of this poem has a strange tone — not unique , for it had sounded somewhere in mediaeval poetry in Italy — but in a dreadful sense divine . At the first reading , this sentence against inconstancy , spoken by one more than inconstant , moves something like indignation ; nevertheless , it is menacingly and obscurely justified , on a ground as it were beyond the common region of tolerance and pardon .</p>
   <p>THE PULLEY</p>
   <p>An editor is greatly tempted to mend a word in these exquisite verses . George Herbert was maladroit in using the word “ rest ” in two senses . “ Peace ” is not quite so characteristic a word , but it ought to take the place of “ rest ” in the last line of the second stanza ; so then the first line of the last stanza would not have this rather distressing ambiguity . The poem is otherwise perfect beyond description .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>MISERY</head>
    <head>George Herbert 's work is so perfectly a box where thoughts “ compacted lie , ” that no one is moved , in reading his rich poetry , to detach a line , so fine and so significant are its neighbours ; nevertheless , it may be well to stop the reader at such a lovely passage as this -</head>
     <l n="1">“ He was a garden in a Paradise . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>THE ROSE</p>
   <p>There is nothing else of Waller 's fine enough to be admitted here ; and even this , though unquestionably a beautiful poem , elastic in words and fresh in feeling , despite its wearied argument , is of the third-class . Greatness seems generally , in the arts , to be of two kinds , and the third rank is less than great . The wearied argument of The Rose is the almost squalid plea of all the poets , from Ronsard to Herrick : “ Time is short ; they make the better bargain who make haste to love . ” This thrifty business and essentially cold impatience was — time out of mind — unknown to the truer love ; it is larger , illiberal , untender , and without all dignity . The poets were wrong to give their verses the message of so sorry a warning . There is only one thing that persuades you to forgive the paltry plea of the poet that time is brief — and that is the charming reflex glimpse it gives of her to whom the rose and the verse were sent , and who had not thought that time was brief .</p>
   <p>L'ALLEGRO</p>
   <p>The sock represents the stage , in L'Allegro , for comedy , and the buskin , in Il Penseroso , for tragedy . Milton seems to think the comic drama in England needs no apology , but he hesitates at the tragic . The poet of King Lear is named for his sweetness and his wood-notes wild .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>IL PENSEROSO</head>
     <l n="1">It is too late to protest against Milton 's display of weak Italian .</l>
     <l n="2">Pensieroso is , of course , what he should have written .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>LYCIDAS</head>
    <head>Most of the allusions in Lycidas need no explaining to readers of poetry . The geography is that of the western coasts from furthest north to Cornwall . Deva is the Dee ; “ the great vision ” means the apparition of the Archangel , St. Michael , at St. Michael 's Mount ; Namancos and Bayona face the mount from the continental coast ; Bellerus stands for Belerium , the Land 's End .</head>
     <l n="1">Arethusa and Mincius — Sicilian and Italian streams — represent the</l>
     <l n="2">pastoral poetry of Theocritus and Virgil .</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>ON A PRAYER-BOOK</head>
    <head>“ Fair and flagrant things ” — Crashaw 's own phrase — might serve for a brilliant and fantastic praise and protest in description of his own verses . In the last century , despite the opinion of a few , and despite the fact that Pope took possession of Crashaw 's line -</head>
     <l n="1">“ Obedient slumbers that can wake and weep , ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>and for some time of the present century , the critics had a wintry word to blame him with . They said of George Herbert , of Lovelace , of Crashaw , and of other light hearts of the seventeenth century — not so much that their inspiration was in bad taste , as that no reader of taste could suffer them . A better opinion on that company of poets is that they had a taste extraordinarily liberal , generous , and elastic , but not essentially lax : taste that gave now and then too much room to play , but anon closed with the purest and exactest laws of temperance and measure . The extravagance of Crashaw is a far more lawful thing than the extravagance of Addison , whom some believe to have committed none ; moreover , Pope and all the politer poets nursed something they were pleased to call a “ rage , ” and this expatiated ( to use another word of their own ) beyond all bounds . Of sheer voluntary extremes it is not in the seventeenth century conceit that we should seek examples , but in an eighteenth century “ rage . ” A “ noble rage , ” properly provoked , could be backed to write more trash than fancy ever tempted the half-incredulous sweet poet of the older time to run upon . He was fancy 's child , and the bard of the eighteenth century was the child of common sense with straws in his hair — vainly arranged there . The eighteenth century was never content with a moderate mind ; it invented “ rage ” ; it matched rage with a flagrant diction mingled of Latin words and simple English words made vacant and ridiculous , and these were the worst ; it was resolved to be behind no century in passion — nay , to show the way , to fire the nations . Addison taught himself , as his hero taught the battle , “ where to rage ” ; and in the later years of the same literary age , Johnson summoned the lapsed and absent fury , with no kind of misgiving as to the resulting verse . Take such a phrase as “ the madded land ” ; there , indeed , is a word coined by the noble rage as the last century evoked it . “ The madded land ” is a phrase intended to prove that the law-giver of taste , Johnson himself , could lodge the fury in his breast when opportunity occurred . “ And dubious title shakes the madded land . ” It would be hard to find anything , even in Addison , more flagrant and less fair .</p>
   <p>Take The Weeper of Crashaw — his most flagrant poem . Its follies are all sweet-humoured , they smile . Its beauties are a quick and abundant shower . The delicate phrases are so mingled with the flagrant that it is difficult to quote them without rousing that general sense of humour of which any one may make a boast ; and I am therefore shy even of citing the “ brisk cherub ” who has early sipped the Saint 's tear : “ Then to his music , ” in Crashaw 's divinely simple phrase ; and his singing “ tastes of this breakfast all day long . ” Sorrow is a queen , he cries to the Weeper , and when sorrow would be seen in state , “ then is she drest by none but thee . ” Then you come upon the fancy , “ Fountain and garden in one face . ” All places , times , and objects are “ Thy tears ’ sweet opportunity . ” If these charming passages lurk in his worst poems , the reader of this anthology will not be able to count them in his best . In the Epiphany Hymn the heavens have found means</p>

   <p>To the Morning : Satisfaction for Sleep , is , all through , luminous . It would be difficult to find , even in the orient poetry of that time , more daylight or more spirit . True , an Elizabethan would not have had poetry so rich as in Love 's Horoscope , but yet an Elizabethan would have had it no fresher . The Hymn to St. Teresa has the brevities which this poet — reproached with his longueurs — masters so well . He tells how the Spanish girl , six years old , set out in search of death : “ She 's for the Moors and Martyrdom . Sweet , not so fast ! ” Of many contemporary songs in pursuit of a fugitive Cupid , Crashaw 's Cupid 's Cryer : out of the Greek , is the most dainty . But if readers should be a little vexed with the poet 's light heart and perpetual pleasure , with the late ripeness of his sweetness , here , for their satisfaction , is a passage capable of the great age that had lately closed when Crashaw wrote . It is in his summons to nature and art :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Come , and come strong ,</l>
     <l n="2">To the conspiracy of our spacious song ! ”</l>

   <p>I have been obliged to take courage to alter the reading of the seventeenth and nineteenth lines of the Prayer-Book , so as to make them intelligible ; they had been obviously misprinted . I have also found it necessary to re-punctuate generally .</p>
   <p>WISHES TO HIS SUPPOSED MISTRESS</p>
   <p>This beautiful and famous poem has its stanzas so carelessly thrown together that editors have allowed themselves a certain freedom with it . I have done the least I could , by separating two stanzas that repeated the rhyme , and by suppressing one that grew tedious .</p>
   <p>ON THE DEATH OF MR. CRASHAW</p>
   <p>This ode has been chosen as more nobly representative than that , better known , On the Death of Mr. William Harvey . In the Crashaw ode , and in the Hymn to the Light , Cowley is , at last , tender . But it cannot be said that his love-poems had tenderness . Be wrote in a gay language , but added nothing to its gaiety . He wrote the language of love , and left it cooler than he found it . What the conceits of Lovelace and the rest — flagrant , not frigid — did not do was done by Cowley 's quenching breath ; the language of love began to lose by him . But even then , even then , who could have foretold what the loss at a later day would be !</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>HYMN TO THE LIGHT</head>
    <head>It is somewhat to be regretted that this splendid poem should show Cowley as the writer of the alexandrine that divides into two lines . For he it was who first used ( or first conspicuously used ) the alexandrine that is organic , integral , and itself a separate unit of metre . He first passed beyond the heroic line , or at least he first used the alexandrine freely , at his pleasure , amid heroic verse ; and after him Dryden took possession and then Pope . But both these masters , when they wrote alexandrines , wrote them in the French manner , divided . Cowley , however , with admirable art , is able to prevent even an accidental pause , making the middle of his line fall upon the middle of some word that is rapid in the speaking and therefore indivisible by pause or even by any lingering . Take this one instance -</head>
     <l n="1">“ Like some fair pine o'erlooking all the ignobler wood . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>If Cowley 's delicate example had ruled in English poetry ( and he surely had authority on this one point , at least ) , this alexandrine would have taken its own place as an important line of English metre , more mobile than the heroic , less fitted to epic or dramatic poetry , but a line liberally lyrical . It would have been the light , pursuing wave that runs suddenly , outrunning twenty , further up the sands than these , a swift traveller , unspent , of longer impulse , of more impetuous foot , of fuller and of hastier breath , more eager to speak , and yet more reluctant to have done . Cowley left the line with all this lyrical promise within it , and if his example had been followed , English prosody would have had in this a valuable bequest .</p>
   <p>Cowley probably was two or three years younger than Richard Crashaw , and the alexandrine is to be found — to be found by searching — in Crashaw ; and he took precisely the same care as Cowley that the long wand of that line should not give way in the middle — should be strong and supple and should last . Here are four of his alexandrines -</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Or you , more noble architects of intellectual noise . ”</l>
     <l n="2">“ Of sweets you have , and murmur that you have no more . ”</l>
     <l n="3">“ And everlasting series of a deathless song . ”</l>
     <l n="4">“ To all the dear-bought nations this redeeming name . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>A later poet — Coventry Patmore — wrote a far longer line than even these — a line not only speeding further , but speeding with a more celestial movement than Cowley or Crashaw heard with the ear of dreams .</p>
   <p>“ He unhappily adopted , ” says Dr. Johnson as to Cowley 's diction , “ that which was predominant . ” “ That which was predominant ” was as good a vintage of English language as the cycles of history have ever brought to pass .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>TO LUCASTA</head>
    <head>Colonel Richard Lovelace , an enchanting poet , is hardly read , except for two poems which are as famous as any in our language . Perhaps the rumour of his conceits has frightened his reader . It must be granted they are now and then daunting ; there is a poem on “ Princess Louisa Drawing ” which is a very maze ; the little paths of verse and fancy turn in upon one another , and the turns are pointed with artificial shouts of joy and surprise . But , again , what a reader unused to a certain living symbolism will be apt to take for a careful and cold conceit is , in truth , a rapture — none graver , none more fiery or more luminous . But even to name the poem where these occur might be to deliver delicate and ardent poetry over to the general sense of humour , which one distrusts . Nor is Lovelace easy reading at any time ( the two or three famous poems excepted ) . The age he adorned lived in constant readiness for the fiddler . Eleven o'clock in the morning was as good an hour as another for a dance , and poetry , too , was gay betimes , but intricate with figures . It is the very order , the perspective , as it were , of the movement that seems to baffle the eye , but the game was a free impulse . Since the first day danced with the first night , no dancing was more natural — at least to a dancer of genius . True , the dance could be tyrannous . It was an importunate fashion . When the Bishop of Hereford , compelled by Robin Hood , in merry Barnsdale , danced in his boots ( “ and glad he could so get away ” ) , he was hardly in worse heart or trim than a seventeenth century author here and there whose original seriousness or work-a-day piety would have been content to go plodding flat-foot or halting , as the muse might naturally incline with him , but whom the tune , the grace , and gallantry of the time beckoned to tread a perpetual measure . Lovelace was a dancer of genius ; nay , he danced to rest his wings , for he was winged , cap and heel . The fiction of flight has lost its charm long since . Modern art grew tired of the idea , now turned to commonplace , and painting took leave of the buoyant urchins — naughty cherub and Cupid together ; but the seventeenth century was in love with that old fancy — more in love , perhaps , than any century in the past . Its late painters , whose human figures had no lack of weight upon the comfortable ground , yet kept a sense of buoyancy for this hovering childhood , and kept the angels and the loves aloft , as though they shook a tree to make a flock of birds flutter up .</head>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In more than one place Lucasta 's , or Amarantha 's , or Laura 's hair is sprinkled with dew or rain almost as freshly and wildly as in Wordsworth 's line .</p>
   <p>Lovelace , who loved freedom , seems to be enclosed in so narrow a book ; yet it is but a “ hermitage . ” To shake out the light and spirit of its leaves is to give a glimpse of liberty not to him , but to the world .</p>
   <p>In To Lucasta I have been bold to alter , at the close , “ you ” to “ thou . ” Lovelace sent his verses out unrevised , and the inconsistency of pronouns is common with him , but nowhere else so distressing as in this brief and otherwise perfect poem . The fault is easily set right , and it seems even an unkindness not to lend him this redress , offered him here as an act of comradeship .</p>
   <p>LUCASTA PAYING HER OBSEQUIES</p>
   <p>That errors should abound in the text of Lovelace is the more lamentable because he was apt to make a play of phrases that depend upon the precision of a comma — nay , upon the precision of the voice in reading . Lucasta Paying her Obsequies is a poem that makes a kind of dainty confusion between the two vestals — the living and the dead ; they are “ equal virgins , ” and you must assign the pronouns carefully to either as you read . This , read twice , must surely be placed amongst the loveliest of his lovely writings . It is a joy to meet such a phrase as “ her brave eyes . ”</p>
   <p>TO ALTHEA , FROM PRISON</p>
   <p>This is a poem that takes the winds with an answering flight . Should they be “ birds ” or “ gods ” that wanton in the air in the first of these gallant stanzas ? Bishop Percy shied at “ gods , ” and with admirable judgment suggested “ birds , ” an amendment adopted by the greater number of succeeding editors , until one or two wished for the other phrase again , as an audacity fit for Lovelace . But the Bishop 's misgiving was after all justified by one of the Mss . of the poem , in which the “ gods ” proved to be “ birds ” long before he changed them . The reader may ask , what is there to choose between birds so divine and gods so light ? But to begin with “ gods ” would be to make an anticlimax of the close . Lovelace led from birds and fishes to winds , and from winds to angels .</p>
   <p>“ When linnet-like confined ” is another modern reading . “ When , like committed linnets , ” daunted the eighteenth century . Nevertheless , it is right seventeenth century , and is now happily restored ; happily , because Lovelace would not have the word “ confined ” twice in this little poem .</p>
   <p>A HORATIAN ODE</p>
   <p>“ He earned the glorious name , ” says a biographer of Andrew Marvell ( editing an issue of that poet 's works which certainly has its faults ) , “ of the British Aristides . ” The portly dulness of the mind that could make such a phrase , and having made , award it , is not , in fairness , to affect a reader 's thought of Marvell himself nor even of his time . Under correction , I should think that the award was not made in his own age ; he did but live on the eve of the day that cumbered its mouth with phrases of such foolish burden and made literature stiff with them . Andrew Marvell 's political rectitude , it is true , seems to have been of a robustious kind ; but his poetry , at its rare best , has a “ wild civility , ” which might puzzle the triumph of him , whoever he was , who made a success of this phrase of the “ British Aristides . ” Nay , it is difficult not to think that Marvell too , who was “ of middling stature , roundish - faced , cherry-cheeked , ” a healthy and active rather than a spiritual Aristides , might himself have been somewhat taken by surprise at the encounters of so subtle a muse . He , as a garden - poet , expected the accustomed Muse to lurk about the fountain - heads , within the caves , and by the walks and the statues of the gods , keeping the tryst of a seventeenth century convention in which there were certainly no surprises . And for fear of the commonplaces of those visits , Marvell sometimes outdoes the whole company of garden-poets in the difficult labours of the fancy . The reader treads with him a “ maze ” most resolutely intricate , and is more than once obliged to turn back , having been too much puzzled on the way to a small , visible , plain , and obvious goal of thought .</p>
   <p>And yet this poet two or three times did meet a Muse he had hardly looked for among the trodden paths ; a spiritual creature had been waiting behind a laurel or an apple-tree . You find him coming away from such a divine ambush a wilder and a simpler man . All his garden had been made ready for poetry , and poetry was indeed there , but in unexpected hiding and in a strange form , looking rather like a fugitive , shy of the poet who was conscious of having her rules by heart , yet sweetly willing to be seen , for all her haste .</p>
   <p>The political poems , needless to say , have an excellence of a different character and a higher degree . They have so much authentic dignity that “ the glorious name of the British Aristides ” really seems duller when it is conferred as the earnings of the Horatian Ode upon Cromwell 's Return from Ireland than when it inappropriately clings to Andrew Marvell , cherry-cheeked , caught in the tendrils of his vines and melons . He shall be , therefore , the British Aristides in those moments of midsummer solitude ; at least , the heavy phrase shall then have the smile it never sought .</p>
   <p>The Satires are , of course , out of reach for their inordinate length . The celebrated Satire on Holland certainly makes the utmost of the fun to be easily found in the physical facts of the country whose people “ with mad labour fished the land to shore . ” The Satire on “ Flecno ” makes the utmost of another joke we know of - - that of famine . Flecno , it will be remembered , was a poet , and poor ; but the joke of his bad verses was hardly needed , so fine does Marvell find that of his hunger . Perhaps there is no age of English satire that does not give forth the sound of that laughter unknown to savages — that craven laughter .</p>
   <p>THE PICTURE OF T. C. IN A PROSPECT OF FLOWERS</p>
   <p>The presence of a furtive irony of the sweetest kind is the sure sign of the visit of that unlooked-for muse . With all spirit and subtlety does Marvell pretend to offer the little girl T. C. ( the future “ virtuous enemy of man ” ) the prophetic homage of the habitual poets . The poem closes with an impassioned tenderness not to be found elsewhere in Marvell .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE DEFINITION OF LOVE</head>
    <head>The noble phrase of the Horatian Ode is not recovered again , high or low , throughout Marvell 's book , it we except one single splendid and surpassing passage from The Definition of Love -</head>
     <l n="1">“ Magnanimous despair alone</l>
     <l n="2">Could show me so divine a thing . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>CHILDHOOD</p>
   <p>One of our true poets , and the first who looked at nature with the full spiritual intellect , Henry Vaughan was known to few but students until Mr. E. K. Chambers gave us his excellent edition . The tender wit and grave play of Herbert , Crashaw 's lovely rapture , are all unlike this meditation of a soul condemned and banished into life . Vaughan 's imagination suddenly opens a new window towards the east . The age seems to change with him , and it is one of the most incredible of all facts that there should be more than a century — and such a century !— from him to Wordsworth . The passing of time between them is strange enough , but the passing of Pope , Prior , and Gray — of the world , the world , whether reasonable or flippant or rhetorical — is more strange . Vaughan 's phrase and diction seem to carry the light . Il vous semble que cette femme degage de la lumiere en marchant ? Vous l'aimez ! says Marius in Les Miserables ( I quote from memory ) , and it seems to be by a sense of light that we know the muse we are to love .</p>
   <p>SCOTTISH BALLADS</p>
   <p>It was no easy matter to choose a group of representative ballads from among so many almost equally fine and equally damaged with thin places . Finally , it seemed best to take , from among the finest , those that had passages of genius — a line here and there of surpassing imagination and poetry — rare in even the best folk - songs . Such passages do not occur but in ballads that are throughout on the level of the highest of their kind . “ None but my foe to be my guide ” so distinguishes Helen of Kirconnell ; the exquisite stanza about the hats of birk , The Wife of Usher 's Well ; its varied refrain , The Dowie Dens of Yarrow ; the stanza spoken by Margaret asking for room in the grave , Sweet William and Margaret ; and a number of passages , Sir Patrick Spens , such as that beginning , “ I saw the new moon late yestreen , ” the stanza beginning “ O laith , laith were our gude Scots lords , ” and almost all the stanzas following . A Lyke Wake Dirge is of surpassing quality throughout . I am sorry to have no room for Jamieson 's version of Fair Annie , for Edom o ’ Gordon , for The Daemon Lover , for Edward , Edward , and for the Scottish edition of The Battle of Otterbourne .</p>
   <p>MRS. ANNE KILLIGREW</p>
   <p>This most majestic ode — one of the few greatest of its kind — is a model of noble rhythm and especially of cadence . To print it whole would be impossible , and one of the very few excisions in this book is made in the midst of it . Dryden , so adult and so far from simplicity , bears himself like a child who , having said something fine , caps it with something foolish . The suppressed part of the ode is silly with a silliness which Dryden 's age chose to dodder in when it would . The deplorable “ rattling bones ” of the closing section has a touch of it .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>SONG , FROM ABDELAZAR</head>
    <head>It is a futile thing — and the cause of a train of futilities — to hail “ style ” as though it were a separable quality in literature , and it is not in that illusion that the style of the opening of Aphra Behn 's resounding song is to be praised . But it IS the style — implying the reckless and majestic heart — that first takes the reader of these great verses .</head>
     <l n="1">HYMN ( The spacious firmament on high )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Whether Addison wrote the whole of this or not ,— and it seems that the inspired passages are none of his — it is to me a poem of genius , magical in spite of the limited diction .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>ELEGY TO THE MEMORY OF AN UNFORTUNATE LADY</head>
    <head>Also in spite of limited diction — the sign of thought closing in , as it did fast close in during those years — are Pope 's tenderness and passion communicated in this beautiful elegy . It would not be too much to say that all his passion , all his tenderness , and certainly all his mystery , are in the few lines at the opening and close . The Epistle of Eloisa is ( artistically speaking ) but a counterfeit . Yet Pope 's Elegy begins by stealing and translating into the false elegance of altered taste that lovely and poetic opening of Ben Jonson 's -</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ What beckoning ghost , besprent with April dew ,</l>
     <l n="2">Hails me so solemnly to yonder yew ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">All the gravity , all the sweetness , one might fear , must be lost in</l>
     <l n="4">such a change as Pope makes -</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">“ What beckoning ghost along the moonlight shade</l>
     <l n="6">Invites my steps , and points to yonder glade ? ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Yet they are not lost . Pope 's awe and ardour are authentic , and they prevail ; the succeeding couplet — inimitably modulated , and of tragic dignity — proves , without delay , the quality of the poem . The poverty and coldness of the passage ( towards the end ) , in which the roses and the angels are somewhat trivially sung , cannot mar so veritable an utterance . The four final couplets are the very glory of the English couplet .</p>
   <p>LINE ON RECEIVING HIS MOTHER 'S PICTURE</p>
   <p>Cowper , again , by the very directness of human feeling makes his narrowing English a means of absolutely direct communication . Of all his works ( and this is my own mere and unshared opinion ) this single one deserves immortality .</p>
   <p>LIFE</p>
   <p>This fragment ( the only fragment , properly so called , in the present collection ) so pleased Wordsworth that he wished he had written the lines . They are very gently touched .</p>
   <p>THE LAND OF DREAMS</p>
   <p>When Blake writes of sleep and dreams he writes under the very influence of the hours of sleep — with a waking consciousness of the wilder emotion of the dream . Corot painted so , when at summer dawn he went out and saw landscape in the hours of sleep .</p>
   <p>SURPRISED BY JOY</p>
   <p>It is not necessary to write notes on Wordsworth 's sonnets — the greatest sonnets in our literature ; but it would be well to warn editors how they print this one sonnet ; “ I wished to share the transport ” is by no means an uncommon reading . Into the history of the variant I have not looked . It is enough that all the suddenness , all the clash and recoil of these impassioned lines are lost by that “ wished ” in the place of “ turned . ” The loss would be the less tolerable in as much as perhaps only here and in that heart-moving poem , ‘ Tis said that some have died for love , is Wordsworth to be confessed as an impassioned poet .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>STEPPING WESTWARD</head>
    <head>This and the preceding two exquisite poems of sympathy are far more justified , more recollected and sincere than is that more monumental composition , the famous poem of sympathy , Hartleap Well . The most beautiful stanzas of this poem last-named are so rebuked by the truths of nature that they must ever stand as obstacles to the straightforward view of sensitive eyes upon the natural world . Wordsworth shows us the ruins of an aspen-wood , a blighted hollow , a dreary place forlorn because an innocent creature , hunted , had there broken its heart in a leap from the rocks above ; grass would not grow , nor shade linger there -</head>
     <l n="1">“ This beast not unobserved by Nature fell ,</l>
     <l n="2">His death was mourned by sympathy divine . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And the signs of that sympathy are cruelly asserted to be these arid woodland ruins — cruelly , because the common sight of the day blossoming over the agonies of animals and birds is made less tolerable by such fictions . We have to shut our ears to the benign beauty of this stanza especially -</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The Being that is in the clouds and air ,</l>
     <l n="2">That is in the green leaves among the groves ,</l>
     <l n="3">Maintains a deep and reverential care</l>
     <l n="4">For the unoffending creature whom He loves . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>We must shut our ears because the poet offers us , as a proof of that “ reverential care , ” the visible alteration of nature at the scene of suffering — an alteration we are obliged to dispense with every day we pass in the woods . We are tempted to ask whether Wordsworth himself believed in a sympathy he asks us — upon such grounds !— to believe in ? Did he think his faith to be worthy of no more than a fictitious sign or a false proof ?</p>
   <p>To choose from Wordsworth is to draw close a net with very large meshes — so that the lovely things that escape must doubtless cause the reader to protest ; but the poems gathered here are not only supremely beautiful but exceedingly Wordsworthian .</p>
   <p>YOUTH AND AGE</p>
   <p>Close to the marvellous Kubla Khan — a poem that wrests the secret of dreams and brings it to the light of verse — I place Youth and Age as the best specimen of Coleridge 's poetry that is quite undelirious — to my mind the only fine specimen . I do not rate his undelirious poems highly , and even this , charming and nimble as it is , seems to me rather lean in thought and image . The tenderness of some of the images comes to a rather lamentable close ; the likeness to “ some poor nigh-related guest ” with the three lines that follow is too squalid for poetry , or prose , or thought .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER</head>
    <head>This poem is surely more full of a certain quality of extreme poetry — the simplest “ flower of the mind , ” the most single magic — than any other in our language . But the reader must be permitted to call the story silly .</head>
     <l n="1">Page 265 ( Are those her ribs through which the Sun )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Coleridge used the sun , moon , and stars as a great dream uses them when the sleeping imagination is obscurely threatened with illness . All through The Ancient Mariner we see them like apparitions . It is a pity that he followed the pranks also of a dream when he impossibly placed a star WITHIN the tip of the crescent .</p>
   <p>Page 266 ( I feer thee , ancient Mariner ! )</p>
   <p>The likeness of “ the ribbed sea sand ” is said to be the one passage actually composed by Wordsworth ,— who according to the first plan should have written The Ancient Mariner with Coleridge — “ and perhaps the most beautiful passage in the poem , ” adds one critic after another . It is no more than a good likeness , and has nothing whatever of the indescribable Coleridge quality .</p>
   <p>Coleridge reveals , throughout this poem , an exaltation of the senses , which is the most poetical thing that can befall a simple poet . It is necessary only to refer , for sight , to the stanza on “ the moving Moon ” at the bottom of page 267 ; for hearing , to the supernatural stanzas on page 271 ; and , for touch , to the line -</p>
   <p>“ And still my body drank . ”</p>

   <p>THE ISLES OF GREECE</p>
   <p>One really fine and poetic stanza — of course , the third ; three stanzas that are good eloquence — the fourth , fifth , and seventh ; and one that is a fair bit of argument — the tenth — may together perhaps carry the rest .</p>
   <p>HELLAS</p>
   <p>The profounder spirit of Shelley 's poem yet leaves it a careless piece of work in comparison with Byron 's . The two false rhymes at the outset may not be of great importance , but there is something annoying in the dissyllabic rhymes of the second stanza . Dissyllabic rhymes are beautiful and enriching when they fall in the right place ; that is , where there is a pause for the second little syllable to stand . For example , they could not be better placed than they would have been at the end of the shorter lines of this same stanza , where they would have dropped into a part of the pause . Another sin of sheer heedlessness — the lapse of grammar in The Skylark , at the top of page 296 ( With thy clear keen joyance ) — will remind the reader of the special habitual error of Drummond of Hawthornden .</p>

   <p>LA BELLE DAME SANS MERCI</p>
   <p>Keats is here the magical poet , as he is the intellectual poet in the great sonnet following ; and it is his possession or promise of both imaginations that proves him greater than Coleridge . In his day they seem to have found Coleridge to be a thinker in his poetry . To me he seems to have had nothing but senses , magic , and simplicity , and these he had to the utmost yet known to man . Keats was to have been a great intellectual poet , besides all that in fact he was .</p>
   <p>ODE TO A NIGHTINGALE</p>
   <p>Of the five odes of Keats , the Nightingale is perhaps the most perfect , and certainly the most imaginative . But the Grecian Urn is the finest , even though it has fancy rather than imagination , for never was fancy more exquisite . The most conspicuous idea — the emptying of the town because its folk are away at play in the tale of the antique urn — is merely a fancy , and a most antic fancy — a prank ; it is an irony of man , a rallying of art , a mockery of time , a burlesque of poetry , divine with tenderness . The six lines in which this fancy sports are amongst the loveliest in all literature : the “ little town , ” the “ peaceful citadel , ” — were ever simple adjectives more happy ? But John Keats 's final moral here is undeniably a failure ; it says so much and means so little . The Ode to Autumn is an exterior ode , and not in so high a rank , but lovely and perfect . The Psyche I love the least , because its fancy is rather weak and its sentiment effusive . It has a touch of the deadly sickliness of Endymion . None the less does it remain just within the group of the really fine odes of English poets . The eloquent Melancholy more narrowly escapes exclusion from that group .</p>
