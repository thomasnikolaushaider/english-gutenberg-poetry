   <p>“ Some years since ” said Thackeray in a public speech , “ when I was younger , and used to frequent jolly assemblies , I wrote a Bacchanalian song to be chanted after dinner ; ” and a contemporary record has preserved a note of “ the radiant gratification of his face whilst Horace Mayhew sang The Mahogany Tree , perhaps the finest and most soul-stirring of Thackeray 's social songs . ”</p>
   <p>In seeking a Souvenir of this Christmas season the ballad of “ The Mahogany Tree ” lends itself most felicitously to the present purpose which is to</p>
   <p>“ — wish you health , and love and mirth , As fits the solemn Christmas-tide . ”</p>
   <p>Putting aside for an hour the affairs of a work-a-day world , let us take our places around the convivial board , on the time-stained surface of which we may find in fancy the initials of so many boon companions of other days cut deep .</p>
   <p>It is pleasant to sport “ round the stem of the jolly old tree ” in congenial company , and to renew our youth at the bidding of this gracious Toastmaster , the centennial of whose birth we shall celebrate presently ; the anniversary of whose death was yester-e'en .</p>
   <p>But while remembering that we shall be none the worse tomorrow for having been happy today , we are not permitted to forget entirely the Blue-devil Sprite that awaits the dawn . The play-spell is over ; the lights are out in Vanity Fair ; and here in Mr. Dulac 's drawing is the leader of our Christmas Chorus as he shuts up the box and the puppets — “ for our play is played out . ”</p>
