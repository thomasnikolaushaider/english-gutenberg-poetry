    <head>THE MORNING VISIT</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A sick man 's chamber , though it often boast</l>
     <l n="2">The grateful presence of a literal toast ,</l>
     <l n="3">Can hardly claim , amidst its various wealth ,</l>
     <l n="4">The right unchallenged to propose a health ;</l>
     <l n="5">Yet though its tenant is denied the feast ,</l>
     <l n="6">Friendship must launch his sentiment at least ,</l>
     <l n="7">As prisoned damsels , locked from lovers ’ lips ,</l>
     <l n="8">Toss them a kiss from off their fingers ’ tips .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">The morning visit ,— not till sickness falls</l>
     <l n="10">In the charmed circles of your own safe walls ;</l>
     <l n="11">Till fever 's throb and pain 's relentless rack</l>
     <l n="12">Stretch you all helpless on your aching back ;</l>
     <l n="13">Not till you play the patient in your turn ,</l>
     <l n="14">The morning visit 's mystery shall you learn .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">‘ T is a small matter in your neighbor 's case ,</l>
     <l n="16">To charge your fee for showing him your face ;</l>
     <l n="17">You skip up-stairs , inquire , inspect , and touch ,</l>
     <l n="18">Prescribe , take leave , and off to twenty such .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">But when at length , by fate 's transferred decree ,</l>
     <l n="20">The visitor becomes the visitee ,</l>
     <l n="21">Oh , then , indeed , it pulls another string ;</l>
     <l n="22">Your ox is gored , and that 's a different thing !</l>
     <l n="23">Your friend is sick : phlegmatic as a Turk ,</l>
     <l n="24">You write your recipe and let it work ;</l>
     <l n="25">Not yours to stand the shiver and the frown ,</l>
     <l n="26">And sometimes worse , with which your draught goes down .</l>
     <l n="27">Calm as a clock your knowing hand directs ,</l>
     <l n="28">Rhei , jalapae ana grana sex ,</l>
     <l n="29">Or traces on some tender missive 's back ,</l>
     <l n="30">Scrupulos duos pulveris ipecac ;</l>
     <l n="31">And leaves your patient to his qualms and gripes ,</l>
     <l n="32">Cool as a sportsman banging at his snipes .</l>
     <l n="33">But change the time , the person , and the place ,</l>
     <l n="34">And be yourself “ the interesting case , ”</l>
     <l n="35">You 'll gain some knowledge which it 's well to learn ;</l>
     <l n="36">In future practice it may serve your turn .</l>
     <l n="37">Leeches , for instance ,— pleasing creatures quite ;</l>
     <l n="38">Try them ,— and bless you ,— do n't you find they bite ?</l>
     <l n="39">You raise a blister for the smallest cause ,</l>
     <l n="40">But be yourself the sitter whom it draws ,</l>
     <l n="41">And trust my statement , you will not deny</l>
     <l n="42">The worst of draughtsmen is your Spanish fly !</l>
     <l n="43">It 's mighty easy ordering when you please ,</l>
     <l n="44">Infusi sennae capiat uncias tres ;</l>
     <l n="45">It 's mighty different when you quackle down</l>
     <l n="46">Your own three ounces of the liquid brown .</l>
     <l n="47">Pilula , pulvis ,— pleasant words enough ,</l>
     <l n="48">When other throats receive the shocking stuff ;</l>
     <l n="49">But oh , what flattery can disguise the groan</l>
     <l n="50">That meets the gulp which sends it through your own !</l>
     <l n="51">Be gentle , then , though Art 's unsparing rules</l>
     <l n="52">Give you the handling of her sharpest tools ;</l>
     <l n="53">Use them not rashly ,— sickness is enough ;</l>
     <l n="54">Be always “ ready , ” but be never “ rough . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="55">Of all the ills that suffering man endures ,</l>
     <l n="56">The largest fraction liberal Nature cures ;</l>
     <l n="57">Of those remaining , ‘ t is the smallest part</l>
     <l n="58">Yields to the efforts of judicious Art ;</l>
     <l n="59">But simple Kindness , kneeling by the bed</l>
     <l n="60">To shift the pillow for the sick man 's head ,</l>
     <l n="61">Give the fresh draught to cool the lips that burn ,</l>
     <l n="62">Fan the hot brow , the weary frame to turn ,—</l>
     <l n="63">Kindness , untutored by our grave M. D .' s ,</l>
     <l n="64">But Nature 's graduate , when she schools to please ,</l>
     <l n="65">Wins back more sufferers with her voice and smile</l>
     <l n="66">Than all the trumpery in the druggist 's pile .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="67">Once more , be quiet : coming up the stair ,</l>
     <l n="68">Do n't be a plantigrade , a human bear ,</l>
     <l n="69">But , stealing softly on the silent toe ,</l>
     <l n="70">Reach the sick chamber ere you 're heard below .</l>
     <l n="71">Whatever changes there may greet your eyes ,</l>
     <l n="72">Let not your looks proclaim the least surprise ;</l>
     <l n="73">It 's not your business by your face to show</l>
     <l n="74">All that your patient does not want to know ;</l>
     <l n="75">Nay , use your optics with considerate care ,</l>
     <l n="76">And do n't abuse your privilege to stare .</l>
     <l n="77">But if your eyes may probe him overmuch ,</l>
     <l n="78">Beware still further how you rudely touch ;</l>
     <l n="79">Do n't clutch his carpus in your icy fist ,</l>
     <l n="80">But warm your fingers ere you take the wrist .</l>
     <l n="81">If the poor victim needs must be percussed ,</l>
     <l n="82">Do n't make an anvil of his aching bust ;</l>
     <l n="83">( Doctors exist within a hundred miles</l>
     <l n="84">Who thump a thorax as they 'd hammer piles ;)</l>
     <l n="85">If you must listen to his doubtful chest ,</l>
     <l n="86">Catch the essentials , and ignore the rest .</l>
     <l n="87">Spare him ; the sufferer wants of you and art</l>
     <l n="88">A track to steer by , not a finished chart .</l>
     <l n="89">So of your questions : do n't in mercy try</l>
     <l n="90">To pump your patient absolutely dry ;</l>
     <l n="91">He 's not a mollusk squirming in a dish ,</l>
     <l n="92">You 're not Agassiz ; and he 's not a fish .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="93">And last , not least , in each perplexing case ,</l>
     <l n="94">Learn the sweet magic of a cheerful face ;</l>
     <l n="95">Not always smiling , but at least serene ,</l>
     <l n="96">When grief and anguish cloud the anxious scene .</l>
     <l n="97">Each look , each movement , every word and tone ,</l>
     <l n="98">Should tell your patient you are all his own ;</l>
     <l n="99">Not the mere artist , purchased to attend ,</l>
     <l n="100">But the warm , ready , self-forgetting friend ,</l>
     <l n="101">Whose genial visit in itself combines</l>
     <l n="102">The best of cordials , tonics , anodynes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="103">Such is the visit that from day to day</l>
     <l n="104">Sheds o'er my chamber its benignant ray .</l>
     <l n="105">I give his health , who never cared to claim</l>
     <l n="106">Her babbling homage from the tongue of Fame ;</l>
     <l n="107">Unmoved by praise , he stands by all confest ,</l>
     <l n="108">The truest , noblest , wisest , kindest , best .</l>

    <head>THE TWO ARMIES</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">As Life 's unending column pours ,</l>
     <l n="2">Two marshalled hosts are seen ,—</l>
     <l n="3">Two armies on the trampled shores</l>
     <l n="4">That Death flows black between .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">One marches to the drum-beat 's roll ,</l>
     <l n="6">The wide-mouthed clarion 's bray ,</l>
     <l n="7">And bears upon a crimson scroll ,</l>
     <l n="8">“ Our glory is to slay . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">One moves in silence by the stream ,</l>
     <l n="10">With sad , yet watchful eyes ,</l>
     <l n="11">Calm as the patient planet 's gleam</l>
     <l n="12">That walks the clouded skies .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Along its front no sabres shine ,</l>
     <l n="14">No blood-red pennons wave ;</l>

     <l n="16">“ Our duty is to save . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">For those no death-bed 's lingering shade ;</l>
     <l n="18">At Honor 's trumpet-call ,</l>
     <l n="19">With knitted brow and lifted blade</l>
     <l n="20">In Glory 's arms they fall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">For these no clashing falchions bright ,</l>
     <l n="22">No stirring battle-cry ;</l>
     <l n="23">The bloodless stabber calls by night ,—</l>
     <l n="24">Each answers , “ Here am I ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">For those the sculptor 's laurelled bust ,</l>
     <l n="26">The builder 's marble piles ,</l>
     <l n="27">The anthems pealing o'er their dust</l>
     <l n="28">Through long cathedral aisles .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">For these the blossom-sprinkled turf</l>

     <l n="33">Two paths lead upward from below ,</l>

     <l n="36">Each falling tear of Love .</l>

     <l n="37">Though from the Hero 's bleeding breast</l>
     <l n="38">Her pulses Freedom drew ,</l>

     <l n="41">While Valor 's haughty champions wait</l>

    <head>THE STETHOSCOPE SONG</head>
    <head>A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">THERE was a young man in Boston town ,</l>
     <l n="2">He bought him a stethoscope nice and new ,</l>
     <l n="3">All mounted and finished and polished down ,</l>
     <l n="4">With an ivory cap and a stopper too .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">It happened a spider within did crawl ,</l>
     <l n="6">And spun him a web of ample size ,</l>
     <l n="7">Wherein there chanced one day to fall</l>
     <l n="8">A couple of very imprudent flies .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">The first was a bottle-fly , big and blue ,</l>
     <l n="10">The second was smaller , and thin and long ;</l>
     <l n="11">So there was a concert between the two ,</l>
     <l n="12">Like an octave flute and a tavern gong .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Now being from Paris but recently ,</l>
     <l n="14">This fine young man would show his skill ;</l>
     <l n="15">And so they gave him , his hand to try ,</l>
     <l n="16">A hospital patient extremely ill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Some said that his liver was short of bile ,</l>
     <l n="18">And some that his heart was over size ,</l>
     <l n="19">While some kept arguing , all the while ,</l>
     <l n="20">He was crammed with tubercles up to his eyes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">This fine young man then up stepped he ,</l>
     <l n="22">And all the doctors made a pause ;</l>
     <l n="23">Said he , The man must die , you see ,</l>
     <l n="24">By the fifty-seventh of Louis 's laws .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">But since the case is a desperate one ,</l>
     <l n="26">To explore his chest it may be well ;</l>
     <l n="27">For if he should die and it were not done ,</l>
     <l n="28">You know the autopsy would not tell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">Then out his stethoscope he took ,</l>
     <l n="30">And on it placed his curious ear ;</l>
     <l n="31">Mon Dieu ! said he , with a knowing look ,</l>
     <l n="32">Why , here is a sound that ‘ s mighty queer .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">The bourdonnement is very clear ,—</l>
     <l n="34">Amphoric buzzing , as I 'm alive</l>
     <l n="35">Five doctors took their turn to hear ;</l>
     <l n="36">Amphoric buzzing , said all the five .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">There 's empyema beyond a doubt ;</l>
     <l n="38">We 'll plunge a trocar in his side .</l>
     <l n="39">The diagnosis was made out ,—</l>
     <l n="40">They tapped the patient ; so he died .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">Now such as hate new-fashioned toys</l>
     <l n="42">Began to look extremely glum ;</l>
     <l n="43">They said that rattles were made for boys ,</l>
     <l n="44">And vowed that his buzzing was all a hum .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="45">There was an old lady had long been sick ,</l>
     <l n="46">And what was the matter none did know</l>
     <l n="47">Her pulse was slow , though her tongue was quick ;</l>
     <l n="48">To her this knowing youth must go .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="49">So there the nice old lady sat ,</l>
     <l n="50">With phials and boxes all in a row ;</l>
     <l n="51">She asked the young doctor what he was at ,</l>
     <l n="52">To thump her and tumble her ruffles so .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="53">Now , when the stethoscope came out ,</l>
     <l n="54">The flies began to buzz and whiz</l>
     <l n="55">Oh ho ! the matter is clear , no doubt ;</l>
     <l n="56">An aneurism there plainly is .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="57">The bruit de rape and the bruit de scie</l>
     <l n="58">And the bruit de diable are all combined ;</l>
     <l n="59">How happy Bouillaud would be ,</l>
     <l n="60">If he a case like this could find !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="61">Now , when the neighboring doctors found</l>
     <l n="62">A case so rare had been descried ,</l>
     <l n="63">They every day her ribs did pound</l>
     <l n="64">In squads of twenty ; so she died .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="65">Then six young damsels , slight and frail ,</l>
     <l n="66">Received this kind young doctor 's cares ;</l>
     <l n="67">They all were getting slim and pale ,</l>
     <l n="68">And short of breath on mounting stairs .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="69">They all made rhymes with “ sighs ” and “ skies , ”</l>
     <l n="70">And loathed their puddings and buttered rolls ,</l>
     <l n="71">And dieted , much to their friends ’ surprise ,</l>
     <l n="72">On pickles and pencils and chalk and coals .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="73">So fast their little hearts did bound ,</l>
     <l n="74">The frightened insects buzzed the more ;</l>
     <l n="75">So over all their chests he found</l>
     <l n="76">The rale sifflant and the rale sonore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="77">He shook his head . There 's grave disease ,—</l>
