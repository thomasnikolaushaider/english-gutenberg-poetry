    <docTitle><titlePart>VICTOR ROY ; A Masonic Poem . BY HARRIETT ANNIE WILKINS . DEDICATED , BY PERMISSION , TO DANIEL SPRY , ESQ . GRAND MASTER OF THE GRAND LODGE , A. F . &amp; A. M. OF CANADA .</titlePart></docTitle>

   <div type="preface">
    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">An anecdote appeared some time ago in the pages of “ The Craftsman ” which gave rise to the ideas embodied in “ Victor Roy . ” It is not a story of profound depth . Its aim is not to soar to Alpine heights of imagination , or to excavate undiscovered treasures from the mines of thought . It is a very simple story , told in very simple words , of such lives as are around us in our midst . It tells of sorrows that are daily being borne by suffering humanity , and of the faith that gives strength to that suffering humanity to endure “ seeing Him , who is invisible . ” All lives may not see their earth day close in sunshine , but somewhere the sun is shining , and all true cross-bearers shall some day become true crown-wearers . The following pages have some references to that Ancient Order which comes down the centuries , bearing upon its structure the marks of that Grand Master Builder , who gave to the visible universe “ the sun to rule the day , the moon and stars to govern the night ; ” an Order which , like these wondrous orbs , is grand in its mysterious symbolism , calm in its unvarying circles , universal in its beneficence .</p>
    <p n="2">We are told of a poor weary traveller who had plucked a flower . The shadows of a grand cathedral lay before him . He entered ; its architecture charmed him , its calmness refreshed him . Approaching a shrine he laid his flower upon it , saying : “ It is all I can give ; it , too , is God 's work , although gathered by a feeble , dying hand . ” A priest standing near looked upon the flower and said : “ God bless you , my brother , heaven is nearer to me . ” So , if by the perusal of “ Victor Roy ” one ear hears more distinctly the Apostolic declaration , “ Pure religion is to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction , ” or if one poor sinking spirit is strengthened , as Longfellow says , to “ touch God 's right hand in the darkness , ” the wishes of the Authoress will be fully accomplished .</p>

   <p>Victor 's Soliloquy .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Heavily rolleth the wintry clouds ,</l>
     <l n="2">And the ceaseless snow is falling , falling ,</l>
     <l n="3">As the frost king 's troops in their icy shrouds ,</l>
     <l n="4">Whistle and howl , like lost spirits calling .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">But a warm luxuriantly furnished room ,</l>
     <l n="6">Is an antidote to the wild night storm ,</l>
     <l n="7">Lamplight and firelight banish the gloom ,</l>
     <l n="8">No poverty stalks there with cold gaunt form .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Yet there seems a shadow , yes even there ,</l>
     <l n="10">Where all is so peacefully grand and still ,</l>
     <l n="11">No fair young face with its shining hair ,</l>
     <l n="12">No voice of love with its musical thrill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">One reigneth alone in that mansion grand ,</l>
     <l n="14">And his day of life has long past its noon ,</l>
     <l n="15">The wanderer of many a foreign land ,</l>
     <l n="16">Rests , calmly waiting Heaven 's final boon .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">There are lines on his brow of grief and care ,</l>
     <l n="18">Writ with a quill from Time 's feathered wing .</l>
     <l n="19">There are silver threads in the chesnut hair ,</l>
     <l n="20">The blossoms white of a fair dawning spring .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">Yet Victor Roy has a kindly word ,</l>
     <l n="22">And a kindly smile for all he meets ;</l>
     <l n="23">No cry of distress is by him unheard ,</l>
     <l n="24">While many a blessing his pathway greets .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">“ Yes , that 's right Jasper , draw the curtains close ,</l>
     <l n="26">And make the fire burn bright ;</l>
     <l n="27">God help the poor and suffering ones</l>
     <l n="28">Within this city to-night .</l>
     <l n="29">Did your wife send food to that sick girl in the market lane to-day ?</l>
     <l n="30">Did you carry coals to the man whose limbs were crushed by the loaded</l>
     <l n="31">dray ?</l>
     <l n="32">Well , that 's all right , what is it you say ? you wish that I did but know</l>
     <l n="33">The comfort I give to hearts that are weak , or erring or low .</l>
     <l n="34">Have you turned lecturer , Jasper ? no ; but it makes you sad ,</l>
     <l n="35">To see me lonely and quiet when I 'm making others glad .</l>
     <l n="36">But Jasper , remember that you and I , hold certain things in trust ,</l>
     <l n="37">We must gain some interest on our gold , not let it lie and rust .</l>
     <l n="38">I am but a steward for the King , till the time of his return ,</l>
     <l n="39">There , that will do , supper at ten ; how bright those fresh coals burn . ”</l>
     <l n="40">Poor Jasper , he thinks me moping and sad ; well , well , I only know</l>
     <l n="41">I do not wish that he or aught should ever consider me so ,</l>
     <l n="42">It would seem like base ingratitude to the Ruler of my way ,</l>
     <l n="43">Who showers His blessings about and around me every day .</l>
     <l n="44">But oh , Great Architect , whose hand has carved my destiny ,</l>
     <l n="45">There was a time when in my pride , I owned not Thine nor Thee ,</l>
     <l n="46">Unheeding the Holy Light Divine to man 's dark pathway sent ,</l>
     <l n="47">Unheeding the Bible , blessed chart , to storm tossed sailors sent ;</l>
     <l n="48">With a film in my eyes , I would not see the ladder based on earth ,</l>
     <l n="49">Yet reaching to the cloud-crowned height , where the true Light has birth .</l>
     <l n="50">The beautiful angels passing up , with all our prayers to God ,</l>
     <l n="51">Our tears and moans , our fading flowers , all stained with mire and sod —</l>
     <l n="52">And coming down ; ah , many a time I have blessed the Lord above ,</l>
     <l n="53">For His pure descending angels , bringing Faith , and Hope , and Love .</l>
     <l n="54">There was a time when all this wealth of glory was lost on me ,</l>
     <l n="55">And I was like a rudderless ship , far out on the rocking sea ,</l>
     <l n="56">I had a friend , oh that blessed word , we had been parted for years ,</l>
     <l n="57">And I wandered one day to find him , my heart had no cloudy fears .</l>
     <l n="58">That day stands out in bold relief upon Memory 's wreck-strewn shore ,</l>
     <l n="59">Like a beacon light in the lighthouse , undimned by the rush and roar .</l>
     <l n="60">‘ Twas a day in the early June , the clover was red in the field ,</l>
     <l n="61">And the zephyrs garnered the kisses , the gentle violets yield .</l>
     <l n="62">Birds sang , and the sunshine flickered out and about through the cloud ,</l>
     <l n="63">What had a day like that to do with a pall , a coffin , a shroud ?</l>
     <l n="64">I stood in a flower-decked churchyard , and on the procession came ,</l>
     <l n="65">Why did I ask to be answered back , that his was the sleeper 's name ,</l>
     <l n="66">Nearer now to the dark brown earth the band of his brothers turned ,</l>
     <l n="67">And on snowy aprons and collars of blue the merry sunbeams burned ,</l>
     <l n="68">I , like a suddenly petrified stone , stood mid the crowd that day ,</l>
     <l n="69">And with ears which seemed to be leaden , I listened and heard one say :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="70">“ Brother , we have met before ,</l>
     <l n="71">Where the Tyler guards the door ,</l>
     <l n="72">We have given the well-known sign ,</l>
     <l n="73">That has blent our souls with thine ,</l>
     <l n="74">Now this eve , thou giv'st no word ,</l>
     <l n="75">Back to our souls deep stired ,</l>
     <l n="76">For the Angel Tylers wait ,</l>
     <l n="77">At thy Lodge Room 's mystic gate .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="78">“ Brother , thou art taking rest ,</l>
     <l n="79">We must still the wild storm breast ,</l>
     <l n="80">We must build through mist and night ,</l>
     <l n="81">Thou hast seen the quenchless Light ,</l>
     <l n="82">While we hew the shapeless stone ,</l>
     <l n="83">Thou hast bowed before the Throne ,</l>
     <l n="84">While we tread the chequered floor ,</l>
     <l n="85">Thou hast pass 'd the golden door .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="86">“ Oh Companion , were we there ,</l>
     <l n="87">Ended every pleading prayer ,</l>
     <l n="88">Ended all the work and toil ,</l>
     <l n="89">Gathered all the fruit and spoil ,</l>
     <l n="90">Finished all the war of sin ,</l>
     <l n="91">By the Warden 's hand shut in ,</l>
     <l n="92">Brother ; once again with thee ,</l>
     <l n="93">What would our first greeting be ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="94">“ Loved Companions , we have given ,</l>
     <l n="95">To the guardianship of Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="96">Our Brother 's precious dust ,</l>
     <l n="97">And in memory of the just ,</l>
     <l n="98">Be it ours still to guard ,</l>
     <l n="99">All he loved , with watch and ward ,</l>
     <l n="100">Till like him we reach a shore ,</l>
     <l n="101">Where these sorrows come no more . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="102">“ All he loved , ” I knew as I stood there , he loved not one of that band</l>
     <l n="103">As we had loved in our boyhood days , heart to heart and hand to hand ,</l>
     <l n="104">They called us David and Jonathan , for our hearts were knit as one ,</l>
     <l n="105">And now I saw him left alone , in the shades of of the dying sun ;</l>
     <l n="106">Was it his spirit beside me stood ; for do not their spirits come ,</l>
     <l n="107">Relieved from all burden of earthly dross , and win us up to their home ?</l>
     <l n="108">Was it his spirit urged me on , to seek for the Orient Light ?</l>
     <l n="109">It seemed that I should be nearer him if one in that mystic rite ,</l>
     <l n="110">Never a Syrian ready to perish , needed more timely aid ,</l>
     <l n="111">Never a pilgrim knocked at the door and found more restful shade ,</l>
     <l n="112">Aye , time has carried me on some way , since the hour I saw the light ,</l>
     <l n="113">And morning has gone , noontide has gone , now soon must draw on the night .</l>
     <l n="114">I heard the young lads in the office talking about me to-day ,</l>
     <l n="115">I did not mean to play the part of eaves-dropper in their way ,</l>
     <l n="116">They were wondering who in the name of fate , I would find for my heir ,</l>
     <l n="117">Wondering why I never was married , there are some so proud and fair ,</l>
     <l n="118">They knew I could have for the asking , and so they went on with their fun ,</l>
     <l n="119">Till the “ Senior Partner ” gave a cough , and then all their mirth was done .</l>
     <l n="120">But I asked from Heaven though I know the way is mingled flower and thorn ,</l>
     <l n="121">That not one from partner to porter may bear all I have borne .</l>
     <l n="122">So Jasper thinks I am sad ; how the wintry winds whistle to-night !</l>
     <l n="123">Heaven grant no poor woman or children are out in this sleety blight .</l>
     <l n="124">I cannot read this eve ; what ails me ? “ Chronicle , ” “ Tribune ” and “ Times , ”</l>
     <l n="125">Lie looking coaxingly at me , I heed not their prose or rhymes ,</l>
     <l n="126">Is it thinking so much of Arthur , brings Aimee before me here ,</l>
     <l n="127">Aimee , my idol , my darling , my pet , who always spoke words of cheer ,</l>
     <l n="128">Did I say what brings her near me to-night , she is with me every day .</l>
     <l n="129">God help me , for Aimee 's another man 's wife three thousand miles away ,</l>
     <l n="130">Oh how we loved ! there 's no use in talking , all do not love the same ,</l>
     <l n="131">To some ‘ tis the bread and breath of life , to some it is only a name .</l>
     <l n="132">We were going to be married the coming spring , we had planned our nest ,</l>
     <l n="133">Down in the fairest of fairy dells , in sight of the blue sea 's breast ,</l>
     <l n="134">When Uncle Roy who had sailed to India , many long years before ,</l>
     <l n="135">Gone from the towers of Edinburgh , and made piles of golden store ,</l>
     <l n="136">Sent for me all in a hurry and ere long he died on my breast ,</l>
     <l n="137">And far from the land of the heather we laid him gently to rest .</l>
     <l n="138">And then came the fever to me , sick and weak at the point of death ,</l>
     <l n="139">Raving for Aimee — they told me ‘ twas Aimee at every breath .</l>
     <l n="140">Weeks passed and I woke again one day to breath as it were new air .</l>
     <l n="141">The crisis over ; now health , life , love and myself a millionaire .</l>
     <l n="142">But Victor Ellis came back no more , I was changed into Victor Roy .</l>
     <l n="143">Yes , a king with a crown of gold , but the gold was a broken toy ,</l>
     <l n="144">For a letter lay by me from England , a strange hand-writing to me ,</l>
     <l n="145">Telling me Aimee , my star of hope , was lost in the treacherous sea .</l>
     <l n="146">A party went boating one eve , and the pleasure boat struck the bar ,</l>
     <l n="147">And before any help could be given , Aimee had floated out far .</l>
     <l n="148">Every available thing was done , that landsman or sailor could try ,</l>
     <l n="149">So fell the burning shower of words that met my bewildered eye .</l>
     <l n="150">Oh the night at noon , I have wondered oft how much the heart will bear ,</l>
     <l n="151">As strand after strand of the toughened cord , strains with the weight and</l>
     <l n="152">wear .</l>
     <l n="153">I felt I must fly , weak as I was , to where she was lying ; perhaps</l>
     <l n="154">‘ Twas a merciful Providence after all , that I took a relapse .</l>
     <l n="155">Oh , the weary months that crawled slowly by at a tortoise creeping pace ,</l>
     <l n="156">I seeming to hear the dash of the waves , that hid a beloved face .</l>
     <l n="157">Time passed , and I learnt that the roaring sea was not the treacherous</l>
     <l n="158">thing .</l>
     <l n="159">‘ Twas not the dumb wave , but a living man that turned to Winter my Spring ,</l>
     <l n="160">And Aimee had married another and sought the Australian shore .</l>
     <l n="161">She must have thought I was dead , Heaven help me , betwixt us ocean 's roar .</l>
     <l n="162">I have sometimes wondered if gold is ever aught but a curse ,</l>
     <l n="163">No , that 's wrong — if honestly gained , no harm in a well filled purse ,</l>
     <l n="164">But I often think of the little home standing there by the sea ,</l>
     <l n="165">For far off merry England , the home planned for Aimee and me .</l>
     <l n="166">Oh to have toiled for her from dawn till the dews of restful night ,</l>
     <l n="167">Her smile my guerdon , her love my prize , her heart so happy and bright .</l>
     <l n="168">Often I wonder if peace and love have sheltered her with their wings ;</l>
     <l n="169">Of wealth I suppose they have plenty , and the comforts money brings ,</l>
     <l n="170">For Montrose was the heir to a large amount of money I know ,</l>
     <l n="171">And he certainly was not the kind of man to let his money go .</l>
     <l n="172">But there must be something warmer than gold to brighten Aimee 's sky ,</l>
     <l n="173">And I hav'nt much faith in a man who could win such a prize by a lie .</l>
     <l n="174">But Heaven is good that I found him not when my soul was passion rife ,</l>
     <l n="175">‘ Twould only have brought her grief , for my aim was a life for a life ,</l>
     <l n="176">Well-a-day ! come here “ Chronicle , ” let us see if you have a word</l>
     <l n="177">To calm the current of burning thoughts that down to their depths are</l>
     <l n="178">stirred ,</l>
     <l n="179">I 'll read the first thing I meet with , murders , fires , or kingdoms riven ;</l>
     <l n="180">Oh you are the first on the page , “ Vera , to her lover in Heaven . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="181">“ My lover why is it this night of storms ,</l>
     <l n="182">My thoughts are ever turning to thee ?</l>
     <l n="183">You who are sheltered from all the blast ,</l>
     <l n="184">Hear the murmuring sounds of the crystal sea .</l>

     <l n="185">“ My lover ; do you remember the day ,</l>
     <l n="186">When last my hands were in yours entwined ,</l>
     <l n="187">And the air was faint with the summer flowers ,</l>
     <l n="188">While a roll of thunder came on the wind .</l>

     <l n="189">“ My lover ; who always spoke words of love ,</l>

     <l n="197">“ My lover ; how long have the seasons been ,</l>
     <l n="198">Since I tried to spell out the small word ‘ wait , ’</l>
     <l n="199">And learnt to know that your love and life ,</l>
     <l n="200">Grow ever more strong as the years grow late .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="201">“ My lover ; in dreams of the night you come ,</l>

     <l n="203">He arches the barriers for the best ,</l>
     <l n="204">And Christ 's love stands at each end of the bar .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="205">“ Some day that arch will widen its breadth ,</l>

     <l n="209">Why did I read these lines , was it only to mock my woe ?</l>
     <l n="210">For less would the burden be and the sin would be less I know ,</l>
     <l n="211">If I knew that my darling was safe and blest where the angels are .</l>
     <l n="212">Why do I murmur ? for God 's will stands at each end of the mystic bar .</l>
     <l n="213">Well , why do I stay here gazing hopelessly into the fire ?</l>
     <l n="214">Watching the coals that glow and burn , then fall away and expire ,</l>
     <l n="215">It seems that out of their flashing light my lost love appears to rise ,</l>
     <l n="216">And another face that has haunted me all day with its wistful eyes</l>
     <l n="217">As we halted at church to-day ; a face , a young girl 's face , so sad ,</l>
     <l n="218">Looked out among the crowd that gazed , and her dark eyes made me glad .</l>
     <l n="219">What strange , queer beings we are , a look , or a song , or a flower ,</l>
     <l n="220">A scent on the air , a sound of the sea , they come with such power ,</l>
     <l n="221">That the long years vanish away , and over death 's murky tide</l>
     <l n="222">Spiritual bodies fearlessly walk , and stand with us side by side .</l>
     <l n="223">Gone is all distance and time , vanished far is the grave 's eclipse .</l>
     <l n="224">Again sweet voices are in our ears , their breath upon our lips ,</l>
     <l n="225">So , with that poor , strange child to-day , who has never heard Aimee 's</l>
     <l n="226">name ,</l>
     <l n="227">Little she thought that her earnest eyes rekindled a smouldering flame .</l>
     <l n="228">There was an old familiar look of the happy days once fled ,</l>
     <l n="229">An old familiar look of one that I love as we love the dead .</l>
     <l n="230">Love her ? love Aimee ? do I love her less , because since I kissed her last</l>
     <l n="231">Over my desolate heart the tides of twenty-five years have passed ?</l>
     <l n="232">I am longing to-night to hear her hymn , her sweet “ Abide with me , ”</l>
     <l n="233">As she sang it , leaning upon my breast the night I put out to sea .</l>
     <l n="234">I know it was only she I loved , and thought of that eventide ;</l>
     <l n="235">But now I can fully endorse the draft , “ O Lord with me abide , ”</l>
     <l n="236">And spite of the heavy clouds that hang o'er my life path near and far ,</l>
     <l n="237">I own with Vera that “ Christ 's love stands at each end of the mystic bar , ”</l>
     <l n="238">And so much of the desert life has been travelled by night and day ,</l>
     <l n="239">That the shores of the summer land are not so very far away .</l>
     <l n="240">And although I know there is one dark sea where black waves heave and</l>
     <l n="241">toss ,</l>
     <l n="242">I know the Pilot who waits for me will carry me safely across .</l>
     <l n="243">My path down to that water 's edge is one avenue of pines ;</l>
     <l n="244">But though I walk amid shadows dim , o'erhead the bright sun shines .</l>

     <l n="9">Nothing new on this beautiful earth ,</l>
     <l n="10">Are hunger and nakedness , cold and pain ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">“ Where is Aimee ? ” here I lie all alone in this wretched hole ,</l>
     <l n="14">I who was reared as a gentleman 's son , an aristocrat to the soul ,</l>
     <l n="15">Could drink more wine at my father 's board than the best man out of a</l>
     <l n="16">score ;</l>
     <l n="17">Rode with the hounds at ten years old , and played high in a few years</l>
     <l n="18">more .</l>
     <l n="19">A man can live without love , but he can n't get along without gold ,</l>
     <l n="20">And a woman and child sadly hamper a fellow that 's poor or old .</l>
     <l n="21">How can a gentleman work and toil year after year like a slave ?</l>
     <l n="22">For when you 've worked your life away you 're asked , “ Why did not you</l>
     <l n="23">save ? ”</l>
     <l n="24">Not that I would reproach my wife , I daresay she has done her best ;</l>
     <l n="25">But women can earn such a trifle , and grow weak if they lose their rest .</l>
     <l n="26">Not that Aimee has ever grumbled , and I am not to be blamed ,</l>
     <l n="27">If she choose to work and stitch away from morn till the sunset flamed ;</l>
     <l n="28">And just the course of my crooked luck , that if but one child we had ,</l>
     <l n="29">The boy must go and the girl must stay ; that boy was a likely lad ,</l>
     <l n="30">Would have been nineteen if he 'd lived , might be earning a good sum now ,</l>
     <l n="31">For Willie was something like me , wide awake , had a sensible brow ;</l>
     <l n="32">But Ethel , poor child , her mother again lives in a world of her own ,</l>
     <l n="33">Sees faces in flowers , hears voices in winds , reads poems from chiselled</l>
     <l n="34">stone .</l>
     <l n="35">I certainly hav n't had the best of luck , I 've tried in different lands ,</l>
     <l n="36">And , as I said , it 's a drag to have others upon your hands .</l>
     <l n="37">‘ Twas a most disappointing thing , of course , when that old aunt died at</l>
     <l n="38">Ayr ,</l>
     <l n="39">And only one hundred pounds was left to Aimee , her rightful heir ;</l>
     <l n="40">Not that I married Aimee for wealth , but I thought it just as sure ,</l>
     <l n="41">That grand estate , to think of it all , and I lying here so poor .</l>
     <l n="42">Ah , I want some brandy ! I must have something to make me feel more strong .</l>
     <l n="43">Brandy ! it is money , and life , and health ; what makes Aimee stay so long ?</l>
     <l n="44">Oh , here you are , make up more fire ; I should think you 're warm enough</l>
     <l n="45">Walking about , let me have that shawl , to-night will be wild and rough .</l>
     <l n="46">I must have some more spirit to keep me up , not that I heed the lie ,</l>
     <l n="47">The doctor told you this morning that before very long I must die .</l>
     <l n="48">I expect , if I had some of the gold your old aunt used to keep ,</l>
     <l n="49">He would manage to raise me up all right — you think I had better sleep ,</l>
     <l n="50">You think me ungrateful , perhaps ; reach some brandy and then you 'll see</l>
     <l n="51">How more than grateful I am , what a pattern of patience I 'll be .</l>
     <l n="52">No money , no means , the last thing 's gone , and Ethel and you in need !</l>
     <l n="53">Well , you must have managed badly enough with only two mouths to feed ,</l>
     <l n="54">For you can n't count me as much , the little support I take ,</l>
     <l n="55">A little stimulant now and then , swallowed only for your sake .</l>
     <l n="56">Aimee , I must have some now — nothing left ? what is that glittering thing ?</l>
     <l n="57">Aimee , you dear one , dispose of that ; of what use is our wedding ring ?</l>
     <l n="58">Do n't be cross for the sake of the child , you say , why you angel dear ,</l>
     <l n="59">Who would ever doubt you , so good , so true , you have nothing to fear .</l>
     <l n="60">And then you 're always trusting in God , and surely he would approve</l>
     <l n="61">Of your selling your wedding ring for him that you 've sworn to love ?</l>
     <l n="62">I wish that wind would stop howling , it says such queer things to me ,</l>
     <l n="63">Wake up , little Ethel , and send her before it 's too dark to see</l>
     <l n="64">If that old fraud of a pawnbroker gives her the change all right .</l>
     <l n="65">Aimee , send quickly , I feel so strange ; oh , I dread this coming night .</l>
     <l n="66">I never murdered that man out there , away on the western plains ;</l>
     <l n="67">And yet there are spots of blood on the floor , they can n't wash out the</l>
     <l n="68">stains .</l>
     <l n="69">What is it the lawyers call it ? “ Accessory to the fact ? ”</l>
     <l n="70">Ha ! ha ! old boy , I was wide awake ; they could not catch me in the act ,</l>
     <l n="71">So we put that poor young fool of a lad , just out from the motherland ,</l>
     <l n="72">Made him just drunk enough to fight when we needed a helping hand ;</l>
     <l n="73">A helping hand with a bowie knife and a corpse to be stowed away ,</l>
     <l n="74">We were sober enough not to be on hand when called upon next day .</l>
     <l n="75">Who 's that ? Who are you ? Stop ! stop ! coming whispering into my ear ,</l>
     <l n="76">“ There are other judges , other law courts , and I have cause to fear . ”</l>
     <l n="77">How the ship struggles and reels — all right — is this the Australian shore ?</l>
     <l n="78">No , sandbars and reefs ; will they never stop those confounded breaker 's</l>
     <l n="79">roar ?</l>
     <l n="80">Aimee , what is it ? Take that stuff ? I will if ‘ twill make me sleep .</l>
     <l n="81">I cannot rest ; shall I never be quiet ; hark how the wild winds sweep .</l>
     <l n="82">No , Victor , no ; you got the money , and that was enough for you .</l>
     <l n="83">Did you think I was fool enough , man , to let you have Aimee too ?</l>
     <l n="84">Aimee , come here and whisper to me ; what does the judgment mean ?</l>
     <l n="85">Judgment and conscience .— Look , look , there 's Victor grinning behind the</l>
     <l n="86">screen !</l>
     <l n="87">Victor in heaven this many a year ? I tell you it is no such thing .</l>
     <l n="88">Aimee , you were dead once — were drowned — did you hear the mermaids sing ?</l>
     <l n="89">I say you were drowned one night , when the pleasure boat struck the bar ,</l>
     <l n="90">And before any help could come you had floated out deep and far .</l>
     <l n="91">Every available thing was done that sailor or landsman could try ;</l>
     <l n="92">But you could not be found — I guess not — so of course you had to die .</l>
     <l n="93">Hav'nt I a remarkable memory ? these were the words I wrote :</l>
     <l n="94">“ Every available thing was done by sailor or landsman afloat . ”</l>
     <l n="95">So Victor knows all about it — there ! there he is coming again ;</l>
     <l n="96">No ! no ! we are'nt here , we 're away on the southern Indian main .</l>
     <l n="97">Who calls me ? Who wants me ? I cannot go into that wild dark land .</l>
     <l n="98">Somebody , help ! Is this death ? Do n't touch me with that cold hand .</l>
     <l n="99">Aimee , do n't leave me ; oh say , have the officers found me at last ?</l>
     <l n="100">Tell me — I think it 's the medicine I took that makes me dream of the</l>
     <l n="101">past —</l>
     <l n="102">Oh , will they believe me up there , in the clear bright rays of the sun ,</l>
     <l n="103">That shows all the by-gone years of a life , the crimes a man has done ?</l>
     <l n="104">Will nobody stop that horrid wind ? it creeps right into my heart ,</l>
     <l n="105">It seems to mutter , and groan and shriek : “ Come , it is time to depart .</l>
     <l n="106">There 's a broad dark sea before me ; help , Aimee , the waters are deep !</l>
     <l n="107">I want a pilot — I cannot steer — I am sinking — let — me — sleep . ”</l>

     <l n="245">A voice seemed whispering to me , “ Watch and pray . ”</l>
     <l n="246">I knelt as He knelt on the grassy sod ,</l>

     <l n="483">‘ Tis the only password at the gates , through which we both must go ,</l>
     <l n="484">Where born of that benevolence which fills our Father 's breast ,</l>
     <l n="485">Angelic masons now prepare our special house of rest ,</l>
     <l n="486">God 's promises will never fail , if we but wait His hours ,</l>
     <l n="487">He sends His messages of peace , like His rainbow after showers ,</l>
     <l n="488">O'er one beam of that holy arch , this scroll now seems to glide ,</l>
     <l n="489">“ After the dark and dreary day , it shall be light at eventide . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="93">How wildly blows the wintry wind , deep lies the drifting snow</l>
     <l n="94">On the hillside , and the roadside , and the valleys down below ;</l>
     <l n="95">And up the gorge all through last night the rushing storm flew fast ,</l>
     <l n="96">And there old walls and casements were rattling in the blast .</l>
     <l n="97">Lady , I had a dream last night , born of the storm and pain ,</l>
     <l n="98">I dreamed it was the time of spring ; but the clouds were black with rain .</l>
     <l n="99">I thought that I was on the bay , a good way out from shore</l>
     <l n="100">Alone , and feeling much afraid at the wild tempest 's roar ,</l>
     <l n="101">I tried to reach the distant land , but could not find the way ,</l>
     <l n="102">And suddenly my boat capsized far out upon the bay .</l>
     <l n="103">I shrieked in wildest agony amid the thunder shock ,</l>
     <l n="104">When I heard you saying unto me , “ Beneath us is a Rock ,</l>
     <l n="105">Trust not to me , these waves are strong , but lift your tear-dimmed eye —</l>
     <l n="106">That star will lead us to the rock that higher is than I . ”</l>
     <l n="107">And through the drenching wave and surf , together on we passed ,</l>
     <l n="108">Till the bright green slopes of Hamilton shone clearly out at last .</l>
     <l n="109">It seemed so strange , we stepped ashore , your garments were all dry ,</l>
     <l n="110">And , holding hands as we do now , I heard you say “ good-bye . ”</l>
     <l n="111">Dear lady , now I see it all , those blessed words you said</l>
     <l n="112">Were with me in the storm last night , like angels round my bed .</l>
     <l n="113">“ So many and great dangers that we cannot stand upright , ”</l>
     <l n="114">“ Defend us by thy mercy , from all perils of this night . ”</l>
     <l n="115">Lady , I am a mother , none know it here save you ;</l>
     <l n="116">Do n't blush for me , there is no shame , I am a wife , leal and true .</l>
     <l n="117">Lady , true love is born of heaven , we may deem it dead and past ,</l>
     <l n="118">And sit with bowed down head alone , the heart 's door closed and fast ;</l>
     <l n="119">When suddenly we hear a voice , and spite of bolt or bar ,</l>
     <l n="120">Like its dear Master , there it stands , stretching its arms afar ;</l>
     <l n="121">Though buried up it rises , though dead it lives anew ,</l>
     <l n="122">And breathes again its Master 's words , “ Sweet peace be unto you , ”</l>
     <l n="123">Folks say , “ There is a mystery about that poor sick girl , ”</l>
     <l n="124">Lady , there 's mystery round us all , that angels will unfurl ,</l>
     <l n="125">I have one favor now to ask , within this paper 's fold ,</l>
     <l n="126">There 's a little lock of baby 's hair , just half one curl of gold ,</l>
     <l n="127">When I am in my coffin , and soon now I 'll be at rest ,</l>
     <l n="128">Will you lay this little curl of gold upon my quiet breast ,</l>
     <l n="129">God and the angels only know where the other half lies hid ,</l>
     <l n="130">In the green sod of old Ireland , neath a baby 's coffin lid ,</l>
     <l n="131">Do n't'leave me yet , it is near night , I feel so strange to-day ,</l>

     <l n="701">Out of His Time .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>One evening a short time since , our attention was attracted by the prolonged ringing of a bell . The given number of strokes had sounded , yet ring , ring , ring . Was it an alarm of fire ? No other bell signalled an answer . Was it some danger to our city ? No crowds were gathering . At length we questioned a passer by , and received for answer , “ It is ringing because an Apprentice is out of his time . ” “ Out of his time ! ” We knew nothing of the boy , neither his name or home , but the waves of air told us something concerning him . We knew he had overcome difficulties , often had he been disheartened and dismayed , often had he heard the mocking laugh or coarse jest of his companions , at his imperfect workmanship , often heard the angry words over goods or tools spoiled through his ignorance or carelessness . He had risen on dark mornings when his neighbors , lads his own age , were snugly sleeping ; he had toiled on glorious summer days when his indolent companions were resting under green trees , or plunging into the cool waters ; he had done the rough work because he was “ the boy . ” Yes , but there is another side to the picture . With courage renewed , with eyes and fingers becoming more and more accustomed to the handicrafts of his trade , every month has found him progressing , till to-night , as the still ringing bell tells us , he has overcome . His companions gather around him with boisterous mirth , and the “ older hands ” feel a certain pride in him , as wringing his hand they know he ranks among themselves , the means of an honest living at his disposal , one of God 's great army of working men . A few hours passed and another bell resounded upon our ears . We listened , for that bell had a sad and solemn sound . Ah , another “ Apprentice was out of his time . ” We knew something of how he had fought , not with rough iron , but with “ the waves of this troublesome world . ” We knew how in every day life he strove to do his duty to his Lord and Master . Dismayed , how often ? Discouraged , how frequently bearing the taunt , the sneer ? But he too had overcome . His companions gather around him , but all mirth is hushed , tears fill their eyes , and choking words are whispered as they file round the casket , and look upon the calm dead face , that no more on earth will meet them with its wonted smile , and the pale hands that have done all their rough earthwork . His welcome we did not hear . Ah , it is well that the sound of harps and the silvery peals from the chiming bells of the city of God reach us not , or perchance we should “ stand all the day idle . ” For are we not all entered Apprentices in this strange world of ours ? Are we not all “ serving our time ? ” How are we learning our trades ? Are we likely to prove “ workmen that need not be ashamed , ” or are we through fear or negligence hiding in the earth our Lord 's money ? Our indentures bear the blood-red seals of Calvary , our Covenant is “ ordered in all things and sure . ” The time of our serving here is unknown to us , of the hour of our release knoweth no man . There have been some who “ being made perfect in a short time , fullfilled for a long time . ” We have a long line of witnesses gone on before , but all drawing their life and courage from that Wonderful Man , the Redeemer of the world , the Carpenter of Galilee . He whose mysterious indentures were cancelled in the noon-day of His life . He who could stand among His sorrowing companions and say , “ Father , I have finished the work which Thou gavest me to do . ” Oh , my fellow apprentices , how often are we tempted to leave our work unfinished . Do we not thus sometimes think , “ I can never learn my trade for heaven here . ” We see one wasting his Master 's goods , we see the tables of the money-changers in the temple of God , we hear our fellows arraigning the Master before their petty tribunals , we grow faint and weary , we have foes within and without . Doubt says , “ The Master is feasting royally and forgets his poor apprentices . ” Courage , courage , my brothers , we are treading the path the saints have trod . This is but a state of preparation . We know not what work for the King we may have to do by-and-by ; over how many cities of whose locality we at present know nothing . He may give us authority to which of the countless worlds in our Father 's universe we may be sent on the King 's message of love , to what spirits in prison we , in our spiritual life , may go to preach of mercy . If here permitted to be the servants of Christ , and through His merits attaining to that better country , may we not reasonably infer that we shall aid Him more and more , till the mediatorial work is ended . Let these thoughts encourage us amidst the cold and heat , the scorn and shame . Let us see to it that we do work the works of our Master . Let us often turn our eyes to those two grand rules of our workshop , “ Do unto others as ye would they should do unto you , ” our golden rule framed in the royal crimson of the King 's authority ; and that other silver lettered motto , framed in the clear , true blue of heaven , “ Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father , is to visit the widow and fatherless in their affliction , and to keep himself unspotted from the world . ” Let us imitate that brother workman of whom Whittier says :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ He gave up his life to others ,</l>
     <l n="2">Himself to his brothers lending ;</l>
     <l n="3">He saw the Lord in His suffering brothers ,</l>
     <l n="4">And not in the clouds descending . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Soon , soon we shall be out of our time ; but here the figure ends . The earthly apprentice , freed from his articles of apprenticeship , may serve any master , the heavenly apprentice asks but one . Oh , Jesus , Master , Thou Saviour of our race , have mercy upon us , grant us so to serve Thee in time , that our earthly labours ended , we may hear Thee say , “ Well done good and faithful servant , ” while the pure and beautiful angels shall rehearse to each other , “ Rejoice , another apprentice is out of his time . ”</p>
   <p>Two Altars .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The sun was rising on earth , sin-tainted , yet beautiful ,</l>

     <l n="26">Why do you still try to follow the steps and voice of your Maker ?</l>
     <l n="27">And why still persist in slaying the white lambs of your meadows ?</l>
     <l n="28">Take of my beautiful flowers and despise all blood shedding . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="29">“ My brother , ” spoke Abel , “ I love the dear innocent flowers .</l>

     <l n="31">All but the singing of birds , the winds and the waters , wild music ,</l>

     <l n="33">But you heard , my brother , as well as myself the commandment ,</l>

     <l n="35">Will shadow our Faith and sweet Hope in the promised atonement ;</l>
     <l n="36">And that terrible sin , those spots in our souls , my dear brother ,</l>
     <l n="37">Can never be cleansed by the lives of the beautiful flowers ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="39">Then angrily answered Cain back to his young brother 's pleading ,</l>
     <l n="40">“ Abel , I have no patience with such mock humiliations ,</l>
     <l n="41">I have no need of a Saviour , I have no need of blood-shedding</l>
     <l n="42">To wash out the stain of my own or my father 's transgression .</l>
     <l n="43">I for myself can make perfect and full restitution ;</l>
     <l n="44">Look at the smoke of your altar curling upward so clearly ,</l>
     <l n="45">Making white cloudlets on high in the blue of the firmament ,</l>
     <l n="46">While mine sweeps the ground that is cursed like the trail of the serpent :</l>
     <l n="47">Why comes down the Maker of this blighted universe , asking</l>
     <l n="48">Why art thou wroth , and why is thy countenance fallen ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="49">Stand I not here in the image of God , who created us ?</l>
     <l n="50">Have I not courage , and freedom , and strength above my inferiors ?</l>
     <l n="51">Did not our father give name to beast , bird , insect and reptile ?</l>
     <l n="52">Shall his children crouch down and kneel like the creature that crawleth ?</l>
     <l n="53">I will not obey this commandment , but I 'll wreath up my altar</l>
     <l n="54">With offerings of earth , with gold of the orange , and red of the roses ,</l>
     <l n="55">I 'll not stain my hands with the blood of an innocent creature . ”</l>
     <l n="56">So Cain turned away from his wondering brother ; perhaps then little</l>
     <l n="57">dreaming</l>
     <l n="58">That on the next morrow he would become earth 's first murderer ;</l>
