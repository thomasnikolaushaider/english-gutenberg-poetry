     <p>TO MY WIFE . This simple story will be recognized by many throughout New England to whom the author has had the pleasure of reciting it . Frequent requests that he would place it in shape for preservation have emboldened him to issue it in its present dress . Painfully conscious of its defects as a literary work , he sends it forth in search of old acquaintances , trusting it may receive a share of that kindly favor bestowed upon it as it fell from his lips .</p>

     <l n="2">In the loftiest room , of princely state ,</l>
     <l n="3">Of a modern palace grand and great ,—</l>
     <l n="4">Whose marble front is a symbol true</l>
     <l n="5">Of the inner splendors hid from view ,—</l>
     <l n="6">On an autumn night , when wild without</l>
     <l n="7">The bold winds held their revel rout ,</l>
     <l n="8">Rudely assailing the passing throng ,</l>
     <l n="9">Through churchyards creeping with mournful song ,</l>
     <l n="10">A group was gathered around a board</l>
     <l n="11">Heaped with all that wealth could afford ,</l>
     <l n="12">Or taste could suggest : dishes costly and rare ,</l>
     <l n="13">Fruits of all climes and all seasons , were there .</l>
     <l n="14">The pendent lights in brilliance danced</l>
     <l n="15">On the gleaming plate their rays enhanced ;</l>
     <l n="16">The massive mirrors thrice displayed</l>
     <l n="17">The stately banquet there arrayed .</l>
     <l n="18">Furniture carved by an artist hand ,</l>
     <l n="19">Carpets which only great wealth could command ,</l>
     <l n="20">Curtains of damask , of lace , and of gold ,</l>
     <l n="21">Spoke of the splendors wealth could unfold ,</l>
     <l n="22">And filled with a joy and a pleasure rare</l>
     <l n="23">The youthful hearts that were gathered there .</l>
     <l n="24">Slender each form , and fair each face ,</l>
     <l n="25">Of the twelve gay lads which that table grace ,</l>
     <l n="26">As with genial talk and pleasant jest</l>
     <l n="27">They banter each other , and cheer their guest .</l>
     <l n="28">For one guest is there , as youthful as they ,</l>
     <l n="29">With a heart as light , and a voice as gay ,</l>
     <l n="30">Who laughs at their jests with ready glee ,</l>
     <l n="31">And whose quick returns speak a spirit free ,</l>
     <l n="32">An honored guest ; for , on the morrow ,</l>
     <l n="33">They must part with him in pain and sorrow .</l>
     <l n="34">The glittering emblems his shoulders bear</l>
     <l n="35">Bid him for strife and for peril prepare ;</l>
     <l n="36">Bid him go forth at his Country 's call ,</l>
     <l n="37">With her banner to triumph , or on it to fall .</l>
     <l n="38">A moment 's pause , as with ready hand</l>
     <l n="39">The waiter hurries , at command ,</l>
     <l n="40">To clear the table , and , instead</l>
     <l n="41">Of the rich , choice viands thickly spread ,</l>
     <l n="42">Ranges dark bottles and cruses , which show</l>
     <l n="43">Marks of long years in damp vaults below .</l>
     <l n="44">The richest juices age can display</l>
     <l n="45">Are quickly spread in tempting array .</l>
     <l n="46">Wines of Bordeaux and Seville are there ,</l>
     <l n="47">With liquors and cordials sparkling and rare ;</l>
     <l n="48">And bottles are opened , and glasses are filled .</l>
     <l n="49">When all in a moment the tumult is stilled ,</l>
     <l n="50">As he who presides with dignified grace</l>
     <l n="51">High raises his goblet , and stands in his place :—</l>
     <l n="52">“ I give you , friends , no warrior 's name</l>
     <l n="53">Your hearts to thrill , your blood to flame ;</l>
     <l n="54">No toast to beauty shall my lips repeat ,</l>
     <l n="55">Where we to-night in sacred friendship meet</l>
     <l n="56">To part with one , who , in our boyhood 's days ,</l>
     <l n="57">Earnest and true , won all our love and praise ;</l>
     <l n="58">Who , on the morrow , plays the hero 's part ,</l>
     <l n="59">And seeks the battle with a loyal heart .</l>
     <l n="60">His health I give with an earnest prayer ,</l>
     <l n="61">That , while on his mission of peril and care ,</l>
     <l n="62">Success may be his , and , by deeds renowned ,</l>
     <l n="63">He may meet us again with laurels crowned . ”</l>
     <l n="64">All glasses are raised , when a gentle hand</l>
     <l n="65">Is heard at the door — all silent stand</l>
     <l n="66">As it slowly opens , and into the light</l>
     <l n="67">An old man steps , his features bright :</l>
     <l n="68">The long white hairs o'er his shoulders stream ;</l>
     <l n="69">Like silver threads in the warm rays beam .</l>
     <l n="70">Wrinkled his brow , and pale his face ,</l>
     <l n="71">Wasted his form , and tottering his pace ,</l>
     <l n="72">Shrunken his cheek ; but the eye above</l>
     <l n="73">Tells of gentleness , kindliness , love .</l>
     <l n="74">And silent stand all as he slowly seeks</l>
     <l n="75">A place near the table , and gently speaks :—</l>

     <l n="81">Look on my face , seamed , not with crime ,</l>

     <l n="84">Till ten more years had by me flown .</l>
     <l n="85">Age is upon me ; not age by years ,</l>

     <l n="92">From earthly care , and finds no peace</l>
     <l n="93">In that sweet belief that at last I hail ,—</l>
     <l n="94">‘ There is rest for the weary beyond the vale . ’</l>
     <l n="95">For to me has come a spirit of light ,</l>
     <l n="96">Bringing the morning , and chasing the night ;</l>
     <l n="97">Causing my heart with joy to swell</l>
     <l n="98">To my Maker , ‘ who doeth all things well . ’</l>
     <l n="99">You shall hear my story : ‘ twill not be long ,</l>
     <l n="100">And may guard you all from sin and from wrong .</l>
     <l n="101">I had wealth and plenty in goodly lands ,</l>
     <l n="102">In houses and cattle ; and from my hands</l>
     <l n="103">Many were fed ; and many were they</l>
     <l n="104">Who partook of my charity day by day .</l>
     <l n="105">My house was open to stranger and friend ;</l>
     <l n="106">And my gold did I lavishly , freely spend .</l>
     <l n="107">But one bitter curse did my wealth uprear</l>
     <l n="108">To poison my life ,— the tempter here ,</l>
     <l n="109">The sparkling demon , which now I see</l>
     <l n="110">From all your glasses glaring on me ,—</l>
     <l n="111">A monster who steals on its prey so slow ,</l>
     <l n="112">That it has your life before you know</l>
     <l n="113">Or dream of its power : this was the curse</l>
     <l n="114">That sat at my fire-side , robbed my purse ,</l>
     <l n="115">Poisoned my life , and left me to be</l>
     <l n="116">A drifting log on the world 's wide sea ,</l>
     <l n="117">Ruined and bankrupt , lost and bereft ;</l>
     <l n="118">No kindred , no fortune , no treasure , left .</l>
     <l n="119">Treasure !— yes ; for I had three sons ,</l>
     <l n="120">The hope of my life ,— three noble ones .</l>
     <l n="121">You shall hear their fate , and then I 'll away ,</l>

     <l n="127">The curse of the wine-cup was in his way .</l>
