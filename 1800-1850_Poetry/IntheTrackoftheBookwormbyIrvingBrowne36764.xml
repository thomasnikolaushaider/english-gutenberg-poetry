    <p>I .</p>
   <p>OBJECTS OF COLLECTION .</p>
   <p>Philosophers have made various and ingenious but incomplete attempts to form a succinct definition of the animal , Man . At first thought it might seem that a perfect definition would be , an animal who makes collections . But one must remember that the magpie does this . Yet this definition is as good as any , and comes nearer exactness than most . What has not the animal Man collected ? Clocks , watches , snuff-boxes , canes , fans , laces , precious stones , china , coins , paper money , spoons , prints , paintings , tulips , orchids , hens , horses , match-boxes , postal stamps , miniatures , violins , show-bills , play-bills , swords , buttons , shoes , china slippers , spools , birds , butterflies , beetles , saddles , skulls , wigs , lanterns , book-plates , knockers , crystal balls , shells , penny toys , death-masks , tea-pots , autographs , rugs , armour , pipes , arrow heads , locks of hair and key locks , and hats ( Jules Verne 's “ Tale of a Hat ” ) , these are some of the most prominent subjects in search of which the animal Man runs up and down the earth , and spends time and money without scruple or stint . But all these curious objects of search fall into insignificance when compared with the ancient , noble and useful passion for collecting books . One of the wisest of the human race said , the only earthly immortality is in writing a book ; and the desire to accumulate these evidences of earthly immortality needs no defense among cultivated men .</p>
    <p>II .</p>
   <p>WHO HAVE COLLECTED BOOKS .</p>
   <p>The mania for book-collecting is by no means a modern disease , but has existed ever since there were books to gather , and has infected many of the wisest and most potent names in history . Euripides is ridiculed by Aristophanes in “ The Frogs ” for collecting books . Of the Roman emperor , Gordian , who flourished ( or rather did not flourish , because he was slain after a reign of thirty-six days ) in the third century , Gibbon says , “ twenty-two acknowledged concubines and a library of sixty thousand volumes attested the variety of his inclinations . ” This combination of uxorious and literary tastes seems to have existed in another monarch of a later period — Henry VIII .— the seeming disproportion of whose expenditure of 10 , 800 pounds for jewels in three years , during which he spent but 100 pounds for books and binding , is explained by the fact that he was indebted for the contents of his libraries to the plunder of monasteries . Henry printed a few copies of his book against Luther on vellum . Cicero , who possessed a superb library , especially rich in Greek , at his villa in Tusculum , thus describes his favorite acquisitions : “ Books to quicken the intelligence of youth , delight age , decorate prosperity , shelter and solace us in adversity , bring enjoyment at home , befriend us out-of-doors , pass the night with us , travel with us , go into the country with us . ”</p>
   <p>Petrarch , who collected books not simply for his own gratification , but aspired to become the founder of a permanent library at Venice , gave his books to the Church of St. Mark ; but the greater part of them perished through neglect , and only a small part remains . Boccaccio , anticipating an early death , offered his library to Petrarch , his dear friend , on his own terms , to insure its preservation , and the poet promised to care for the collection in case he survived Boccaccio ; but the latter , outliving Petrarch , bequeathed his books to the Augustinians of Florence , and some of them are still shown to visitors in the Laurentinian Library . From Boccaccio 's own account of his collection , one must believe his books quite inappropriate for a monastic library , and the good monks probably instituted an auto da fe for most of them , like that which befell the knightly romances in “ Don Quixote . ” Perhaps the naughty story-teller intended the donation as a covert satire . The walls of the room which formerly contained Montaigne 's books , and is at this day exhibited to pilgrims , are covered with inscriptions burnt in with branding-irons on the beams and rafters by the eccentric and delightful essayist . The author of “ Ivanhoe ” adorned his magnificent library with suits of superb armor , and luxuriated in demonology and witchcraft . The caustic Swift was in the habit of annotating his books , and writing on the fly-leaves a summary opinion of the author 's merits ; whatever else he had , he owned no Shakespeare , nor can any reference to him be found in the nineteen volumes of Swift 's works . Military men seem always to have had a passion for books . To say nothing of the literary and rhetorical tastes of Caesar , “ the foremost man of all time , ” Frederick the Great had libraries at Sans Souci , Potsdam , and Berlin , in which he arranged the volumes by classes without regard to size . Thick volumes he rebound in sections for more convenient use , and his favorite French authors he sometimes caused to be reprinted in compact editions to his taste . The great Conde inherited a valuable library from his father , and enlarged and loved it . Marlborough had twenty-five books on vellum , all earlier than 1496 . The hard-fighting Junot had a vellum library which sold in London for 1 , 400 pounds , while his great master was not too busy in conquering Europe not only to solace himself in his permanent libraries , and in books which he carried with him in his expeditions , but to project and actually commence the printing of a camp library of duodecimo volumes , without margins , and in thin covers , to embrace some three thousand volumes , and which he had designed to complete in six years by employing one hundred and twenty compositors and twenty-five editors , at an outlay of about 163 , 000 pounds . St. Helena destroyed this scheme . It is curious to note that Napoleon despised Voltaire as heartily as Frederick admired him , but gave Fielding and Le Sage places among his traveling companions ; while the Bibliomaniac appears in his direction to his librarian : “ I will have fine editions and handsome bindings . I am rich enough for that . ” The main thing that shakes one 's confidence in the correctness of his literary taste is that he was fond of “ Ossian . ” Julius Caesar also formed a traveling library of forty-four little volumes , contained in an oak case measuring 16 by 11 by 3 inches , covered with leather . The books are bound in white vellum , and consist of history , philosophy , theology , and poetry , in Greek and Latin . The collector was Sir Julius Caesar , of England , and this exquisite and unique collection is in the British Museum . The books were all printed between 1591 and 1616 .</p>
   <p>Southey brought together fourteen thousand volumes , the most valuable collection which had up to that time been acquired by any man whose means and estate lay , as he once said of himself , in his inkstand . Time fails me to speak of Erasmus , De Thou , Grotius , Goethe , Bodley ; Hans Sloane , whose private library of fifty thousand volumes was the beginning of that of the British Museum ; the Cardinal Borromeo , who founded the Ambrosian Library at Milan with his own forty thousand volumes , and the other great names entitled to the description of Bibliomaniac . We must not forget Sir Richard Whittington , of feline fame , who gave 400 pounds to found the library of Christ 's Hospital , London .</p>
   <p>The fair sex , good and bad , have been lovers of books or founders of libraries ; witness the distinguished names of Lady Jane Gray , Catherine De Medicis , and Diane de Poictiers .</p>
   <p>It only remains to speak of the great opium-eater , who was a sort of literary ghoul , famed for borrowing books and never returning them , and whose library was thus made up of the enforced contributions of friends — for who would have dared refuse the loan of a book to Thomas de Quincey ? The name of the unhappy man would have descended to us with that of the incendiary of the Temple of Diana at Ephesus . But the great Thomas was recklessly careless and slovenly in his use of books ; and Burton , in the “ Book-hunter , ” tells us that “ he once gave in copy written on the edges of a tall octavo ‘ Somnium Scipionis , ’ and as he did not obliterate the original matter , the printer was rather puzzled , and made a funny jumble between the letter-press Latin and the manuscript English . ” I seriously fear that with him must be ranked the gentle Elia , who said : “ A book reads the better which is our own , and has been so long known to us that we know the topography of its blots and dog 's ears , and can trace the dirt in it to having read it at tea with buttered muffins , or over a pipe , which I think is the maximum . ” And yet a great degree of slovenliness may be excused in Charles because , according to Leigh Hunt , he once gave a kiss to an old folio Chapman 's “ Homer , ” and when asked how he knew his books one from the other , for hardly any were lettered , he answered : “ How does a shepherd know his sheep ? ”</p>
   <p>The love of books displayed by the sensual Henry and the pugnacious Junot is not more remarkable than that of the epicurean and sumptuous Lucullus , to whom Pompey , when sick , having been directed by his physician to eat a thrush for dinner , and learning from his servants that in summer-time thrushes were not to be found anywhere but in Lucullus ’ fattening coops , refused to be indebted for his meal , observing : “ So if Lucullus had not been an epicure , Pompey had not lived . ” Of him the veracious Plutarch says : “ His furnishing a library , however , deserved praise and record , for he collected very many and choice manuscripts ; and the use they were put to was even more magnificent than the purchase , the library being always open , and the walks and reading rooms about it free to all Greeks , whose delight it was to leave their other occupations and hasten thither as to the habitation of the Muses . ”</p>
   <p>It is not recorded that Socrates collected books — his wife probably objected — but we have his word for it that he loved them . He did not love the country , and the only thing that could tempt him thither was a book . Acknowledging this to Phaedrus he says :</p>
   <p>“ Very true , my good friend ; and I hope that you will excuse me when you hear the reason , which is , that I am a lover of knowledge , and the men who dwell in the city are my teachers , and not the trees or the country . Though I do indeed believe that you have found a spell with which to draw me out of the city into the country , like a hungry cow before whom a bough or a bunch of fruit is waved . For only hold up before me in like manner a book , and you may lead me all round Attica , and over the wide world . And now having arrived , I intend to lie down , and do you choose any posture in which you can read best . ”</p>
   <p>III .</p>
   <p>DIVERSE TASTES .</p>
   <p>It is fortunate for the harmony of book-collectors that they do not all desire the same thing , just as it was fortunate for their young State that all the Romans did not want the same Sabine woman . Otherwise the Helenic battle of the books would be fiercer than it is . Thus there are bibliomaniacs who reprint rare books from their own libraries in limited numbers ; authors , like Walpole , who print their own works , and whose fame as printers is better deserved than their reputation as writers ; like Thackeray , who design the illustrations for their own romances , or , like Astor , who procure a single copy of their novel to be illustrated at lavish expense by artists ; amateurs who bind their own books ; lunatics who yearn for books wholly engraved , or printed only on one side of the leaf , or Greek books wholly in capitals , or others in the italic letter ; or black-letter fanciers ; or tall copy men ; or rubricists , missal men , or first edition men , or incunabulists .</p>
   <p>One seeks only ancient books ; another limited editions ; another those privately printed ; a fourth wants nothing but presentation copies ; yet another only those that have belonged to famous men , and still another illustrated or illuminated books . There is a perfectly rabid and incurable class , of whom the most harmless are devoted to pamphlets ; another , rather more dangerous , to incorrect or suppressed editions ; and a third , stark mad , to play-bills and portraits . One patronizes the drama , one poetry , one the fine arts , another books about books and their collectors ; and a very recherche class devote themselves to works on playing-cards , angling , magic , or chess , emblems , dances of death , or the jest books and facetiae . Finally , there are those unhappy beings who run up and down for duplicates , searching for every edition of their favorite authors . In very recent days there has arisen a large class who demand the first editions of popular novelists like Dickens , Thackeray and Hawthorne , and will pay large prices for these issues which have no value except that of rarity . I can quite understand the enthusiasm of the collector over the beautiful first editions of the Greek and Latin classics , or for the first “ Paradise Lost , ” or even for the ugly first folio “ Shakespeare , ” and why he should prefer the comparatively rude first Walton 's Angler to Pickering 's edition , the handsomest of this century , with its monumental title page . But why a first edition of a popular novel should be more desirable than a late one , which is usually the more elegant , I confess I cannot understand . It is one of those things which , like the mystery of religion , we must take on trust . So when a bookseller tells me that a copy of the first issue of “ The Scarlet Letter ” has sold for seventy-five dollars , and that a copy of the second , with the same date , but put out six months later , is worth only seventy-five cents , I open my eyes but not my purse , especially when I consider that the second is greatly superior to the first on account of its famous preface of apology , and when I read of some one 's bidding $ 1875 for a copy of Poe 's worthless “ Tamerlane , ” I am flattered by the reflection that there is one man in the world whom I believe to be eighteen hundred and seventy-five times as great a fool as I am !</p>
   <p>IV .</p>
   <p>THE SIZE OF BOOKS .</p>
   <p>Were I a despotic ruler of the universe I would make it a serious offense to publish a book larger than royal octavo . Books should be made to read , or at all events to look at , and in this view comfort and ease should be consulted . Any one who has ever undertaken to read a huge quarto or folio will sympathize with this view . The older and lazier the Book-Worm grows the more he longs for little books , which he can hold in one hand without getting a cramp , or at least support with arms in an elbow chair without fatigue . Darwin remorselessly split big books in two . Mr. Slater says in “ Book Collecting : ” “ When the library at Sion College took fire the attendants , at the risk of their lives , rescued a pile of books from the flames , and it is said that the librarian wept when he found that the porters had taken it for granted that the value of a book was in exact proportion to its size . ” Few of us , I suspect , ever read our family Bible , and all of us probably groan when we lift out the unabridged dictionary . The “ Century Dictionary ” is a luxury because it is published in small and convenient parts . I cannot conceive any good in a big book except that the ladies may use it to press flowers or mosses in , or the nurses may put it in a chair to sit the baby on at table . I have heard of a gentleman who inherited a mass of folio volumes and arranged them as shelves for his smaller treasures , and of another who arranged his 12-mos on a stand made up of the seventeen volumes of Pinkerton 's “ Voyages ” and Denon 's “ Egypt ” for shelves . What reader would not prefer a dainty little Elzevir to the huge folio , Caesar 's “ Commentaries , ” even with the big bull in it , and the wicker idol full of burning human victims ? What can be more pleasing than the modern Quantin edition of the classics ? Or , to speak of a popular book , take the “ Pastels in Prose , ” the most exquisite book for the price ever known in the history of printing . The small book ought however to be easily legible . The health and comfort of the human eye should be consulted in the size of the type . Nothing can be worse in this regard than the Pickering diamond classics , if meant to be read ; and it seems that there are too many of them to be intended as mere curiosities of printing . Let us approve the exit of the folio and the quarto , and applaud the modern tendency toward little and handy volumes . Large paper however is a worthy distinction when the subject is worth the distinction and the edition is not too large . Nothing raises the gorge of the true Book-Worm more than to see an issue on large paper of a row of histories , for example ; and the very worst instance conceivable was a large paper Webster 's “ Unabridged Dictionary ” issued some years ago . The book thus distinguished ought to be a classic , or peculiar for elegance , never a series , or stereotyped , the first struck off , and the issue ought not to be more than from fifty to one hundred copies ; any larger issue is not worth the extra margin bestowed , and no experienced buyer will tolerate it . But if all these conditions are observed , the large paper copies bear the same relation to the small that a proof before letters of a print holds to the other impressions . Large margins are very pleasant in a library as well as in Wall Street , and much more apt to be permanent . There are some favorite books of which the possessor longs in vain for a large copy , as for instance , the Pickering “ Walton and Cotton . ”</p>
   <p>A great deal of fun is made of the Book-Worm because of his desire for large paper and of his insistence on uncut edges , but his reasons are sound and his taste is unimpeachable . The tricks of the book-trade to catch the inexperienced with the bait of large paper are very amusing . “ Strictly limited ” to so many copies for England and so many for America , say a thousand in all , or else the number is not stated , and always described as an edition de luxe , and its looks are always very repulsive . But the bait is eagerly bitten at by a shoal of beings anxious to get one of these rarities — a class to one of whom I once found it necessary to explain that “ uncut edges ” does not mean leaves not cut open , and that he would not injure the value of his book by being able to read it , and was not bound to peep in surreptitiously like a maid-servant at a door “ on the jar . ” I once knew a satirical Book-Worm who issued a pamphlet , “ one hundred copies on large paper , none on small . ” There is no just distinction in an ugly large-paper issue , and sometimes it is not nearly so beautiful as the small , especially when the latter has uncut edges . The independence of the collector who prefers the small in such circumstances is to be commended and imitated .</p>
   <p>Too great inequality in uncut edges is also to be shunned as an ugliness . It seems that some French books are printed on paper of two different sizes , the effect of which is very grotesque , and the device is a catering to a very crude and extravagant taste .</p>

   <p>BINDING .</p>
   <p>The binding of books for several centuries has held the dignity of a fine art , quite independent of printing . This has been demonstrated by exhibitions in this country and abroad . But every collector ought to observe fitness in the binding which he procures to be executed . True fitness prevails in most old and fine bindings ; seldom was a costly garb bestowed on a book unworthy of it . But in many a luxurious library we see a modern binding fit for a unique or rare book given to one that is comparatively worthless or common . Not to speak of bindings that are real works of art , many collectors go astray in dressing lumber in purple and fine linen — putting full levant morocco on blockhead histories and such stuff that perishes in the not using . It is a sad spectacle to behold a unique binding wasted on a book of no more value than a backgammon board . There are of course not a great many of us who can afford unique bindings , but those who cannot should at least observe propriety and fitness in this regard , and draw the line severely between full dress and demi-toilette , and keep a sharp eye to appropriateness of color . I have known several men who bound their books all alike . Nothing could be worse except one who should bind particular subjects in special styles , pace Mr. Ellwanger , who , in “ The Story of My House , ” advises the Book-Worm to “ bind the poets in yellow or orange , books on nature in olive , the philosophers in blue , the French classics in red , ” etc . I am curious to know what color this pleasant writer would adopt for the binding of his books by military men , such for example as “ Major Walpole 's Anecdotes . ” ( p. 262 ) .</p>
   <p>Ambrose Fermin Didot recommended binding the “ Iliad ” in red and the “ Odyssey ” in blue , for the Greek rhapsodists wore a scarlet cloak when they recited the former and a blue one when they recited the latter . The churchmen he would clothe in violet , cardinals in scarlet , philosophers in black .</p>

   <p>After all , whether one can afford a three-hundred or a three-dollar binding , the gentle Elia has said the last word about fitness of bindings when he observed : “ To be strong-backed and neat-bound is the desideratum of a volume ; magnificence comes after . This , when it can be afforded , is not to be lavished on all kinds of books indiscriminately .</p>
   <p>“ Where we know that a book is at once both good and rare — where the individual is almost the species ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ We know not where is that Prometian torch</l>
     <l n="2">That can its light relumine ; ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Such a book for instance as the ‘ Life of the Duke of Newcastle ’ by his Duchess — no casket is rich enough , no casing sufficiently durable , to honor and keep safe such a jewel .</p>
   <p>“ To view a well arranged assortment of block-headed encyclopoedias ( Anglicana or Metropolitanas ) , set out in an array of Russia and Morocco , when a tithe of that good leather would comfortably reclothe my shivering folios , would renovate Parcelsus himself , and enable old Raymond Lully to look like himself again in the world . I never see these impostors but I long to strip them and warm my ragged veterans in their spoils . ”</p>
   <p>There spoke the true Book-Worm . What a pity he could not have sold a part of his good sense and fine taste to some of the affluent collectors of this period !</p>
   <p>Doubtless an experienced binder could give some amusing examples of mistakes in indorsing books with their names . One remains in my memory . A French binder , entrusted with a French translation of “ Uncle Tom 's Cabin , ” in two volumes , put “ L'Oncle ” on both , and numbered them “ Tome 1 , ” “ Tome 2 . ” Charles Cowden-Clarke tells of his having ordered Leigh Hunt 's poems entitled “ Foliage ” to be bound in green , and how the book came home in blue . That would answer for the “ blue grass ” region of Kentucky . I have no patience with those disgusting realists who bind books in human or snake skin . In his charming book on the Law Reporters , Mr. Wallace says of Desaussures ’ South Carolina Reports : “ When these volumes are found in their original binding most persons , I think , are struck with its peculiarity . The cause of it is , I believe , that it was done by negroes . ” What the “ peculiarity ” is he does not disclose . But book-binding seems to be an unwonted occupation for negro slaves . It was not often that they beat skins , although their own skins were frequently beaten .</p>
   <p>VI .</p>
   <p>PAPER .</p>
   <p>It is a serious question whether the art of printing has been improved except in facility . Is not the first printed book still the finest ever printed ? But in one point I am certain that the moderns have fallen away , at least in the production of cheap books , and that is in the quality and finish of the paper . Not to speak of injurious devices to make the book heavy , the custom of calendering the paper , or making it smooth and shiny , practised by some important publishers , is bad for the eyes , and the result is not pleasant to look at . It is like the glare of the glass over the framed print . It is said to be necessary to the production of the modern “ process ” pictures . Even here however there is a just mean , for some of the modern paper is absurdly rough , and very difficult for a good impression of the types . Modern paper however has one advantage : Mr. Blades , in his pleasant “ Enemies of Books , ” tells us “ that the worm will not touch it , ” it is so adulterated . One hint I would give the publishers — allow us a few more fly leaves , so that we may paste in newspaper cuttings , and make memoranda and suggestions .</p>
   <p>It is predicted by some that our nineteenth century books — at least those of the last third — will not last ; that the paper and ink are far inferior to those of preceding centuries , and that the destroying tooth of time will work havoc with them . No doubt the modern paper and the modern ink are inferior to those of the earlier ages of printing , when making a book was a fine art and a work of conscience , but whether the modern productions of the press will ultimately fade and crumble is a question to be determined only by a considerable lapse of time , which probably no one living will be qualified to pronounce upon . Take for what they are worth my sentiments respecting</p>

   <p>WOMEN AS COLLECTORS .</p>
   <p>Women collect all sorts of things except books . To them the book-sense seems to be denied , and it is difficult for them to appreciate its existence in men . To be sure , there have been a few celebrated book-collectors among the fair sex , but they have usually been rather reprehensible ladies , like Diane de Poictiers and Madame Pompadour . Probably Aspasia was a collector of MSS . Lady Jane Grey seems to have been a virtuous exception , and she was cruelly “ cropped . ” I am told that there are a few women now-a-days who collect books , and only a few weeks ago a lady read , before a woman 's club in Chicago , a paper on the Collection and Adornment of Books , for which occasion a fair member of the club solicited me to write her something appropriate to read , which of course I was glad to do . But this was in Chicago , where the women go in for culture . In thirty years ’ haunting of the book-shops and print-shops of New York , I have never seen a woman catching a cold in her head by turning over the large prints , nor soiling her dainty gloves by handling the dirty old books . Women have been depicted in literature in many different occupations , situations and pleasures , but in all the literature that I have read I can recall only one instance in which she is imagined a book-buyer . This is in “ The Sentimental Journey , ” and in celebrating the unique instance let me rise to a nobler strain and sing a song of</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>M. Uzanne , in “ The Book-Hunter in Paris , ” avers that “ the woman of fashion never goes book-hunting , ” and he puts the aphorism in italics . He also says that the occasional woman at the book-stalls , “ if by chance she wants a book , tries to bargain for it as if it were a lobster or a fowl . ” Also that the book-stall keepers are always watchful of the woman with an ulster , a water-proof , or a muff . These garments are not always impervious to books , it seems .</p>
   <p>The imitative efforts of women at “ extra-illustrating ” are usually limited to buying a set of photographs at Rome and sticking them into the cracks of “ The Marble Faun , ” and giving it away to a friend as a marked favor . Poor Hawthorne ! he would wriggle in his grave if he could see his fair admirers doing this . Mr. Blades certainly ought to have included women among the enemies of books . They generally regard the husband 's or father 's expenditure on books as so much spoil of their gowns and jewels . We book-men are up to all the tricks of getting the books into the house without their knowing it . What joy and glee when we successfully smuggle in a parcel from the express , right under our wife 's nose , while she is busy talking scandal to another woman in the drawing-room ! The good creatures make us positively dishonest and endanger our eternal welfare . How we “ hustle around ” in their absence , when the embargo is temporarily raised ; and when the new purchases are detected , how we pretend that they are old , and wonder that they have not seen them before , and rattle away in a fevered , embarrassed manner about the scarcity and value of the surreptitious purchases , and how meanly conscious we are all the time that the pretense is unavailing and the fair despots see right through us . God has given them an instinct that is more than a match for our acknowledged superior intellect . And the good wife smiles quietly but satirically , and says , in the form in that case made and provided , “ My dear , you 'll certainly ruin yourself buying books ! ” with a sigh that agitates a very costly diamond necklace reposing on her shapely bosom ; or she archly shakes at us a warning finger all aglow with ruby and sapphire , which she has bought on installments out of the house allowance . Fortunate for us if the library is not condemned to be cleaned twice a year . These beloved objects ought to deny themselves a ring , or a horse , or a gown , or a ball now and then , to atone for their mankind 's debauchery in books ; but do they ? They ought to encourage the Bibliomania , for it keeps their husbands out of mischief , away from “ that horrid club , ” and safe at home of evenings . The Book-Worm is always a blameless being . He never has to hie to Canada as a refuge . He is “ absolutely pure , ” like all the baking powders .</p>
   <p>The gentle Addison , in “ The Spectator , ” thus described a woman 's library : “ The very sound of a lady 's library gave me a great curiosity to see it ; and as it was some time before the lady came to me , I had an opportunity of turning over a great many of her books , which were ranged together in a very beautiful order . At the end of the folios ( which were finely bound and gilt ) were great jars of china placed one above another in a very noble piece of architecture . The quartos were separated from the octavos by a pile of smaller vessels , which rose in a delightful pyramid . The octavos were bounded by tea-dishes of all shapes , colors , and sizes , which were so disposed on a wooden frame that they looked like one continued pillar indented with the finest strokes of sculpture , and stained with the greatest variety of dyes . That part of the library which was designed for the reception of plays and pamphlets , and other loose papers , was inclosed in a kind of square , consisting of one of the prettiest grotesque works that I ever saw , and made up of scaramouches , lions , mandarins , monkeys , trees , shells , and a thousand other odd figures in china ware . In the midst of the room was a little Japan table with a quire of gilt paper upon it , and on the paper a silver snuff-box made in shape of a little book . I found there were several other counterfeit books upon the upper shelves , which were carved in wood , and served only to fill up the number , like fagots in the muster of a regiment . I was wonderfully pleased with such a mixed kind of furniture as seemed very suitable both to the lady and the scholar , and did not know at first whether I should fancy myself in a grotto or in a library ” .</p>

   <p>In the charming romance , “ Realmah , ” the noble African prince prescribes monogamy to his subjects , but he allows himself three wives ; one is a State wife , to sit by his side on the throne , help him receive embassadors , and preside at court dinners ; another a household wife , to rule the kitchen and the homely affairs of the palace ; the third is a love-wife , to be cherished in his heart and bear him children . Why would it not be fair to the Book-Worm to concede him a Book-wife , who should understand and sympathize with him in his eccentricity , and who should care more for rare and beautiful books than for diamonds , laces , Easter bonnets and ten-button gloves ?</p>
   <p>In regard to women 's book-clubs , a recent writer , Mr. Edward Sanford Martin , in “ Windfalls of Observation , ” observes : “ If a man wants to read a book he buys it , and if he likes it he buys six more copies and gives ( not all the same day , of course ) to six women whose intelligence he respects . But if a club of fifteen girls determine to read a book , do they buy fifteen copies ? No . Do they buy five copies ? No . Do they buy — No , they do n't buy at all ; they borrow a copy . It does n't lie in womankind to spend money for books unless they are meant to be a gift for some man . ” Mr. Martin is a little too hard here , for I have been told of such clubs which sometimes bought one copy . To be sure they always bully the bookseller into letting them have it at cost on account of the probable benefit to his trade . But it is true that no normally organized woman will forego a dollar 's worth of ribbon or gloves for a dollar 's worth of book . I have sometimes read aloud to a number of women while they were sewing , but I do it no more , for just as I got to a point where you ought to be able to hear a pin drop , I always have heard some woman whisper , “ Lend me your eighty cotton . ” A story was told me of the first meeting of a Browning Club in a large city in Ohio . My informant was a young lady from the East , who was present , and my readers can safely rely on the correctness of the narration . The club was composed of young ladies from sixteen to twenty-five years of age , all of the “ first families . ” It was thought best to take an easy poem for the first meeting , and so one of them read aloud , “ The Last Ride Together ” . After the reading there was a moment 's silence , and then one observed that she would like to know whether they took that ride on horseback or in a “ buggy . ” Another silence , and then an artless young bud ventured the remark that she thought it must have been in a buggy , because if it was on horseback he could not have got his arm around her . I once thought of sending this anecdote to Mr. Browning , but was warned that he was destitute of the sense of humor , especially at his own expense , and so desisted .</p>

     <l n="1">“ Ah , that our wives could only see</l>
     <l n="2">How well the money is invested</l>
     <l n="3">In these old books , which seem to be</l>
     <l n="4">By them , alas ! so much detested . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But the wives are not always unwise in their opposition to their husband 's book-buying . There is nothing more pitiful than to see the widow of a poor clergyman or lawyer trying to sell his library , and to witness her disappointment at the shrinkage of value which she had been taught and accustomed to regard as so great . A woman who has a true and wise sympathy with her husband 's book-buying is an adored object . I recollect one such , who at her own suggestion gave up the largest and best room in her house to her husband 's books , and received her callers and guests in a smaller one — she also received her husband 's blessing .</p>

    <head>THE ILLUSTRATOR .</head>
    <head>The popular notion of the Illustrator , as the term is used by the Book-Worm , is that he buys many valuable books containing pictures and spoils them by tearing the pictures out , and from them constructs another valuable book with pictures . We smile to read this in the newspapers . If it were strictly true it would be a very reprehensible practice . But generally the books compelled to surrender their prints to the Illustrator are good for nothing else . To lament over them is as foolish as to grieve over the grape-skins out of which has been pressed the luscious Johannisburger , or to mourn over the unsightly holes which the porcelain-potter has made in the clay-bank . Even among Book-Worms the Illustrator , or the “ Grangerite , ” as the term of reproach is , has come in for many hard knocks in recent years . John Hill Burton set the tune by his merry satire in “ The Book-Hunter , ” in which he portrays the Grangerite illustrating the pious Watts ’ stanzas , beginning , “ How doth the little busy bee . ” In his first edition Mr. Burton mentioned among “ great writers on bees , ” whose portrait would be desirable , Aristarchus , meaning probably Aristomachus . This mistake is not corrected in the last edition , but the name is omitted altogether .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Mr. Beverly Chew “ drops into poetry ” on the subject , and thus</l>
     <l n="2">apostrophises the Grangerite :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ Ah , ruthless wight ,</l>
     <l n="4">Think of the books you 've turned to waste ,</l>
     <l n="5">With patient skill . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Mr. Henri Pere Du Bois thus describes the ordinary result : “ Of one hundred books extended by the insertion of prints which were not made for them , ninety-nine are ruined ; the hundredth book is no longer a book ; it is a museum . An imperfect book , built with the spoils of a thousand books ; a crazy quilt made of patches out of gowns of queens and scullions . ” So Burton compares the Grangerite to Genghis Kahn . Mr. Lang declares the Grangerites are “ book ghouls , and brood , like the obscene demons of Arabian superstition , over the fragments of the mighty dead . ” I would like to show Mr. Lang how I have treated his “ Letters to Dead Authors ” and “ Old Friends ” by illustration . He would probably feel , with AEsop 's lawyer , that “ circumstances alter cases , ” although he says “ no book deserves the honor ” .</p>
   <p>So a reviewer in “ The Nation ” stigmatises Grangerism as “ a vampire art , maiming when it does not murder ” ( I did not know that vampires “ maim ” their victims ) “ and incapable of rising beyond canibalism ” ( not that they feed on one another , but when critics get excited their metaphors are apt to become mixed ) .</p>
   <p>“ G. W. S ., ” of the New York “ Tribune , ” speaks of the achievement of the Illustrators as “ colossal vulgarities . ” Mr. Percy Fitzgerald observes : “ The pitiless Grangerite slaughters a book for a few pictures , just as an epicure has had a sheep killed for the sweetbread ” .</p>
   <p>These are very choice hard words . There is much extravagance , but some justice in all this criticism . As a question of economics I do not find any great difference between a Book-worm who spends thousands of dollars in constructing one attractive book from several not attractive , and one who spends a thousand dollars in binding a book , or for an example of a famous old binder . If there is any difference it is in favor of the Grangerite , who improves the volume for the intelligent purposes of the reader , as against the other who merely caters to “ the lust of the eye ” .</p>
   <p>I am willing to concede that the Grangerite is sometimes guilty of some gross offenses against good taste and good sense . The worst of these is when he extends the text of the volume itself to a larger page in order to embrace large prints . This is grotesque , for it spoils the very book . He is also blamable when he squanders valuable prints and time and patience on mere book lumber , such as long rows of histories ; and when he stuffs and crams his book ; and when his pictures are not of the era of the events or of the time of life of the persons described ; and when they are too large or too small to be in just proportion to the printed page ; and when the book is so heavy and cumbersome that no one can handle it with comfort or convenience . Above all he is blamable , in my estimation , when he entrusts the selection of prints to an agent . Such agency is frequently very unsatisfactory , and at all events the Illustrator misses the sport of the hunt . Few men would entrust the furnishing or decorating of a house , the purchase of a horse , or the selection of a wife to a third person , and the delicate matter of choosing prints for a book is essentially one to be transacted in person . The danger of any other procedure in the case of a wife was illustrated by Cromwell 's agency for Henry Eighth in the affair of Anne of Cleves , the “ Flanders mare . ”</p>
   <p>But when it is properly done , it seems to me that the very best thing the Book-Worm ever does is to illustrate his books , because this insures his reading them , at least with his fingers . Not always , for a certain chronicler of collections of privately illustrated books in this country narrates , how “ relying upon the index ” of a book , which he illustrated , he inserted a portrait of Sam Johnson , the famous , whereas “ the text called for Sam Johnson , an eccentric dramatic writer , ” etc . His binder , he says , laughed at him for being ignorant that there “ two Sam Johnsons ” ( there are four in the biographical dictionaries , one of whom was an early president of King 's College in New York ) . But if done personally and conscientiously it is a means of valuable culture . As one of the oldest survivors of the genus Illustrator in this country , I have thus assumed to offer an apology and defense for my much berated kind . And now let me make a few suggestions as to what seems to me the most suitable mode of the pursuit .</p>
   <p>In illustrating there seem to be two methods , which may be described as the literal or realistic , and imaginative . The first consists simply in the insertion of portraits , views and scenes appropriate to the text . A pleasing variety may be imparted to this method by substituting for a mere portrait a scene in the life of the celebrity in question . For example , if Charles V. and Titian are mentioned together , it would be interesting to insert a picture representing the historical incident of the emperor picking up and handing the artist a brush which he had dropped — and one will have an interesting hunt to find it . But I am more an adherent of the romantic school , which finds excellent play in the illustration of poetry . For example , in the poem , “ Ennui , ” in “ The Croakers , ” for the line , “ The fiend , the fiend is on me still , ” I found , after a search of some years , a picture of an imp sitting on the breast of a man in bed with the gout . In the same stanza are the lines , “ Like a cruel cat , that sucks a child to death , ” and for this I have a print from a children 's magazine , of a cat squatting on the breast of a child in a cradle . Now I would like “ a Madagascar bat , ” which rhymes to “ cat ” in the poem . “ And like a tom-cat dies by inches , ” is illustrated by a picture of a cat caught by the paw in a steel trap . “ Simon ” was “ a gentleman of color , ” the favorite pastry cook and caterer of New York half a century ago — before the days of Mr. Ward McAllister . “ The Croaker ” advises him to “ buy an eye-glass and become a dandy and a gentleman . ” This is illustrated by a rare and fine print of a colored gentleman , dressed in breeches , silk stockings , and ruffled shirt , scanning an overdressed lady of African descent through an eye-glass . “ The ups and downs of politics ” is illustrated by a Cruikshank print , the upper part of which shows a party making an ascension in a balloon and the lower part a party making a descent in a diving-bell , and entitled “ the ups and downs of life . ” To illustrate the phrase , “ seeing the elephant , ” take the print of Pyrrhus trying to frighten his captive , Fabricus , by suddenly drawing the curtains of his tent and showing him an elephant with his trunk raised in a baggage-smashing attitude . For “ The Croakers ” there are apt illustrations also of the following queer subjects : Korah , Dathan and Abiram ; Miss Atropos , shut up your Scissors ; Albany 's two Steeples high in Air , Reading Cobbett 's Register , Bony in His Prison Isle , Giant Wife , Beauty and The Beast , Fly Market , Tammany Hall , The Dove from Noah 's Ark , Rome Saved by Geese , Caesar Offered a Crown , Caesar Crossing the Rubicon , Dick Ricker 's Bust , Sancho in His Island Reigning , The Wisest of Wild Fowl , Reynold ’ Beer House , A Mummy , A Chimney Sweep , The Arab 's Wind , Pygmalion , Danae , Highland Chieftain with His Tail On , Nightmare , Shaking Quakers , Polony 's Crazy Daughter , Bubble-Blowing , First Pair of Breeches , Banquo 's Ghost , Press Gang , Fair Lady With the Bandaged Eye , A Warrior Leaning on His Sword , A Warrior 's Tomb , A Duel , and A Street Flirtation .</p>
   <p>As the charm of illustrating consists in the hunt for the prints , so the latter method is the more engrossing because the game is the more difficult to run down . Portraits , views and scenes are plenty , but to find them properly adaptable is frequently difficult . Some things which one would suppose readily procurable are really hard to find . For example , it was a weary chase to get a treadmill , and so of a drum-major , although the latter is now not uncommon : and although I know it exists , I have not attained unto a bastinado . Sirens and mermaids are rather retiring , and when Vedder depicted the Sea-Serpent he conferred a boon on Illustrators . “ God 's Scales , ” in which the mendicant weighs down the rich man , is a rarity . Milton leaving his card on Galileo in prison is among my wants , although I have seen it .</p>
   <p>As to scarce portraits , let me sing a song of</p>

   <p>By way of jest I have inserted an anonymous portrait opposite an anonymous poem , and was once gravely asked by an absent-minded friend if it really was the portrait of the author . One however will probably look in vain for portraits of “ Quatorze ” and “ Quinze , ” for which a print seller of New York once had an inquiry , and I have been told of a collector who returned Arlington because of the cut on his nose , and Ogle because of his damaged eye . But there is more sport in hunting for a dodo than a rabbit .</p>
   <p>It is also a pleasant thing to lay a picture occasionally in a book without setting out to illustrate it regularly , so that it may break upon one as a surprise when he takes up the book years afterward . It is a grateful surprise to find in Ruskin 's “ Modern Painters ” a casual print from Roger 's “ Italy , ” and in Hamerton 's books some sporadic etchings by Rembrandt or Hayden . It is like discovering an unexpected “ quarter ” in the pocket of an old waistcoat . For example , in “ With Thackeray in America , ” Mr. Eyre Crowe tells how the second number of the first edition of “ The Newcomes ” came to the author when he was in Paris , and how he found fault with Doyle 's illustration of the games of the Charterhouse boys . He says : “ The peccant accessory which roused the wrath of the writer was the group of two boys playing at marbles on the left of the spectator . ‘ Why , ’ said the irate author , ‘ they would as soon thought of cutting off their heads as play marbles at the Charterhouse ! ’ This woodcut was , I noticed , suppressed altogether in subsequent editions . ” Now in my copy — not being the possessor of the first edition — I have made a reference to Mr. Crowe 's passage , and supplied the suppressed cut from an early American copy which cost me twenty-five cents . How many of the first edition men know of the interesting fact narrated by Mr. Crowe ? The Illustrator ought always at least to insert the portrait of the author whenever it has been omitted by the publisher .</p>
   <p>Second : What to illustrate . The Illustrator should not be an imitator or follower , but should strive after an unhackneyed subject . A man is not apt to marry the woman who flings herself at his head ; he loves the excitement of courting ; and so there is not much amusement in utilizing common pictures , but the charm consists in hunting for scarce ones . It is very natural to tread in others ’ tracks , and easy , because the market affords plenty of material for the common subjects . Shakespeare and Walton and Boswell 's Johnson , and a few other things of that sort , have been done to death , and there is fairer scope in something else . Biographies of Painters , Elia 's Essays , Sir Thomas Browne 's “ Religio Medici ” and “ Urn Burial , ” “ Childe Harold , ” Horace , Virgil , the Life of Bayard , or of Vittoria Colonna , or Philip Sidney , and Sappho are charming subjects , and not too common . A ponderous or voluminous work lends itself less conveniently to the purpose than a small book in one or two volumes . Great quartos and folios are mere mausoleums or repositories for expensive prints , too huge to handle , and too extensive for any one ever to look through , and therefore they afford little pleasure to the owners or their guests . An illustrated Shakespeare in thirty volumes is theoretically a very grand object , but I should never have the heart to open it , and as for histories , I should as soon think of illustrating a dictionary . Walton is a lovely subject , but I would adopt a small copy and keep it within two or three volumes . After all there is nothing so charming as a single little illustrated volume , like “ Ballads of Books , ” compiled by Brander Matthews ; Andrew Lang 's “ Letters to Dead Authors , ” or “ Old Friends , ” Friswell 's “ Varia , ” the “ Book of Death , ” “ Melodies and Madrigals , ” “ The Book of Rubies , ” Winter 's “ Shakespeare 's England . ”</p>
   <p>A gentleman who published , a good many years ago , a monograph of privately illustrated books in this country , spoke of the work that I had done in this field , and criticised me for my “ apparent want of method , ” “ eccentricity , ” “ madness , ” “ vagaries , ” “ omnivorousness , ” and “ lack of speciality or system , ” and finally , although he blamed me for having illustrated pretty much everything , he also blamed me for not having illustrated any “ biographical works . ” This criticism seems not only inconsistent , but without basis , for one man may not dictate to another what he shall prefer to illustrate for his own amusement , any more than what sort of a house or pictures he shall buy or what complexion or stature his wife shall have . The author also did me the honor to spell my name wrong , and did the famous Greek amatory poet the honor of mentioning among my illustrated work , “ Odes to Anacreon . ” Would that I could find that book !</p>
   <p>I offer these suggestions with diffidence , and with no intention to impose my taste upon others .</p>
   <p>If the Illustrator can get or make something absolutely unique he is a fortunate man . For example , I know one , stigmatized as eccentric , who has illustrated a printed catalogue of his own library with portraits of the authors , copies of prints in the books , and duplicates of engraved title-pages ; also one who has illustrated a collection in print or in manuscript of his own poems ; also one who has illustrated a Life of Hercules , written by himself , printed by one of his own family , and adorned with prints from antique gems and other subjects ; and even a lawyer who has illustrated a law book written by himself , in which he has found place for prints so diverse and apparently out of keeping as Jonah and the whale , John Brown , a man pacing the floor in a nightgown with a crying baby , a “ darkey ” shot in a melon-patch , an elephant on the rampage , Cupid , Hudibras writing a letter , Joanna Southcote , Launce and his dog , a dog catching a boy going over a wall , Dr. Watts , Robinson Crusoe , Barnum in the form of a hum-bug , Jacob Hall the rope dancer , Lord Mayor 's procession , Raphael discoursing to Adam , gathering sea-weed , Artemus Ward , a whale ashore , a barber-shop , Gilpin 's ride , King Lear , St. Lawrence on his gridiron , Charles Lamb , Terpsichore , and a child tumbling into a well . The owner of such a book may be sure that it is unique , as the man was certain his coat of arms was genuine , because he made it himself .</p>
   <p>Third : the Illustrator should not be in a hurry .</p>
   <p>There are three singular things about the hunt for pictures . One is , the moment you have your book bound , no matter how many years you may have waited , some rare picture you wanted is sure to turn up . Hence the reluctance of the Illustrator to commit himself to binding , a reluctance only paralleled by that of the lover to marry the woman he had courted for ten years , because then he would have no place to spend his evenings . ( I have had books “ in hand ” for twenty years ) .</p>
   <p>Another is , when you have found your rare picture you are pretty certain to find one or two duplicates . Prints , like accidents or crimes , seem to come in cycles and schools . I have known a man to search in vain in thirty print-shops in London , and coming home find what he wanted in a New York print-shop , and two copies at that . The third is , that you are continually coming very near the object without quite attaining it . Thus one may get Lady Godiva alone , and the effigy of Peeping Tom on the corner of an old house at Coventry , but to procure the whole scene is , so far as I know , out of the question . It would seem that Mr. Anthony Comstock has put his ban on it . So one will find it difficult to get “ God 's scales , ” in which wealth and poverty are weighed against each other , but I have had other scales thrust at me , such as those in which the emblems of love are weighed against those of religion , and a king against a beggar , but even the latter is not the precise thing , for in these days there are poor kings and rich beggars .</p>
   <p>One opinion in which all illustrators agree seems sound , and that is , that photographs are not to be tolerated . Photography is the most misrepresentative of arts . But an exception may be indulged in the case of those few celebrities who are too modest to allow themselves to be engraved , and of whom photography furnishes the only portraiture . A photographic copy of a rare portrait in oil is also admissible . Some also exclude wood-cuts . I am not such a purist as that . They are frequently the only means of illustrating a subject , and small and fine wood-cuts form charming head and tail pieces and marginal adornments . One who eschews wood-cuts must forego such interesting little subjects as Washington and his little hatchet , God 's scales , the skeleton in the closet , and many of those which I have particularized . I flatter myself that I have made the margins of a good many books very interesting by means of small wood-cuts , of which our modern magazines provide an abundant and exquisite supply . These furnish a copious source of specific illustration .</p>
   <p>With their zeal illustrators are sometimes apt to be anachronistic . Every book ought to be illustrated in the spirit and costume of its time . The book should not be stuffed too full of prints ; let a better proportion be preserved between the text and the illustrations than Falstaff observed between his bread and his sack . The prints should not be so numerous as to cause the text to be forgotten , as in the case of a tedious sermon .</p>
   <p>Probably nearly every collector expects that his treasures will be dispersed at his death , if not sooner . But it is a serious question to the illustrator , what will become of these precious objects upon which he has spent so much time , thought and labor , and for which he has expended so much money . He never cares and rarely knows , and if he knows he never tells , how much they have cost , but he may always be certain that they will never fetch their cost . Let us not indulge in any false dreams on this subject . The time may have been when prints were cheap and when the illustrator may have been able to make himself whole or even reap a profit , but that day I believe has gone by . One can hardly expect that his family will care for these things ; the son generally thinks the Book-Worm a bore , and the wife of one 's bosom and the daughter of one 's heart usually affect more interest than they feel , and if they kept such objects would do so from a sense of duty alone , as the ancient Romans preserved the cinerary urns of their ancestors . For myself , I have often imagined my grandson listlessly turning over one of my favorite illustrated volumes , and saying , “ What a funny old duffer grandad must have been ! ” Such a book-club , as the “ Grolier , ” of New York , is a fortunate avenue of escape from these evils . There one might deposit at least some of his peculiar treasures , certain that they would receive good care , be regarded with permanent interest , and keep alive his memory .</p>
   <p>To augment his books by inserting prints is ordinarily just the one thing which the Book-Worm can do to render them in a deeper sense his own , and to gain for himself a peculiar proprietorship in them . Generally he cannot himself bind them , but by this means he may render himself a coadjutor of the author , and place himself on equal terms with the printer and the binder .</p>
   <p>After he has illustrated a favorite book once , it is an enjoyable occupation for the Book-Worm to do it over again , in a different spirit and with different pictures . “ Second thoughts are best , ” it has been said , and I have more than once improved my subject by a second treatment .</p>
   <p>There is another form of illustration , of which I have not spoken , and that is the insertion of clippings from magazines and newspapers in the fly leaves . Sometimes these are of intense interest . My own Dickens , Thackeray and Hawthorne , in particular have their porticoes and posterms plentifully supplied with material of this sort . The latest contribution of this kind is to “ Martin Chuzzlewit , ” and consists in the information that a western American “ land-shark ” has recently swindled people by selling them swamp-lots , attractively depicted on a map and named Eden . In my Pepys I have laid Mr. Lang 's recent letter to the diarist . So on a fly leaf of Hawthorne 's Life it is pleasing to see a cut of his little red house at Lenox , now destroyed by fire .</p>
   <p>IX .</p>
   <p>BOOK-PLATES .</p>
   <p>A rather modern form of book-spoliation has arisen in the collection of book-plates . These are literally derived “ ex libris , ” and the business cannot be indulged , as a general thing , without in some sense despoiling books . It cannot be denied that it is a fascinating pursuit . So undoubtedly is the taking of watches or rings or other “ articles of bigotry or virtue , ” on the highway . But somehow there is something so essentially personal in a book-plate , that it is hard to understand why other persons than the owners should become possessed by a passion for it . Many years ago when Burton , the great comedian , was in his prime , he used to act in a farce called “ Toodles ” — at all events , that was his name in the play — and he was afflicted with a wife who had a mania for attending auctions and buying all kinds of things , useful or useless , provided that they only seemed cheap . One day she came home with a door-plate , inscribed , “ Thompson ” — “ Thompson with a p , ” as Toodles wrathfully described it ; and this was more than Toodles could stand . He could not see what possible use there could ever be in that door-plate for the Toodles family . In those same days , there used to be displayed on the door of a modest house , on the east side of Broadway , in the city of New York , somewhere about Eighth Street , a silver door-plate inscribed , “ Mr. Astor . ” This appertained to the original John Jacob . In those days I frequently remarked it , and thought what a prize it would be to Mrs. Toodles or some collector of door-plates . Now I can understand why one might acquire a taste for collecting book-plates of distinguished men or famous book-collectors , just as one collects autographs ; but why collect hundreds and thousands of book-plates of undistinguished and even unknown persons , frequently consisting of nothing more than family coats-of-arms , or mere family names ? I must confess that I share to a certain extent in Mr. Lang 's antipathy to this species of collecting , and am disposed to call down on these collectors Shakespeare 's curse on him who should move his bones . But I cannot go with Mr. Lang when he calls these well-meaning and by no means mischevious persons some hard names .</p>
   <p>In some localities it is quite the vogue to take off the coffin-plate from the coffin — all the other silver “ trimmings , ” too , for that matter — and preserve it , and even have it framed and hung up in the home of the late lamented . There may be a sense of proprietorship in the mourners , who have bought and paid for it , and see no good reason for burying it , that will justify this practice . At all events it is a family matter . The coffin plate reminds the desolate survivors of the person designated , who is shelved forever in the dust . But what would be said of the sense or sanity of one who should go about collecting and framing coffin-plates , cataloguing them , and even exchanging them ?</p>
   <p>Book-worms penetrate to different distances in books . Some go no further than the title page ; others dig into the preface or bore into the table of contents ; a few begin excavations at the close , to see “ how it comes out . ” But that Worm is most easily satisfied who never goes beyond the inside of the front cover , and passes his time in prying off the book-plates .</p>
   <p>I think I have heard of persons who collect colophons . These go to work in the reverse direction , and are even more reprehensible than the accumulators of book-plates , because they inevitably ruin the book .</p>
   <p>A book-plate is appropriate , sometimes ornamental , even beautiful , in its intended place in the proprietor 's book . Out of that , with rare exceptions , it strikes one like the coffin-plate , framed and hanging on the wall . It gives additional value and attractiveness to a book which one buys , but it ought to remain there .</p>
   <p>If one purchases books once owned by A , B and C — undistinguished persons , or even distinguished — containing their autographs , he does not cut them out to form a collection of autographs . If the name is not celebrated , the autograph has no interest or value ; if famous , it has still greater interest and value by remaining in the book . So it seems to me it should be in respect to book-plates . Let Mr. Astor 's door-plate stay on his front door , and let the energetic Mrs. Toodles content herself in buying something less invididual and more adaptable .</p>
   <p>A book-plate really is of no value except to the owner , as the man says of papers which he has lost . It cannot be utilized to mark the possessions of another . In this respect it is of inferior value to the door-plate , for possibly another Mr. Astor might arise , to whom the orignal door-plate might be sold . A Boston newspaper tells of a peddler of door-plates who contracted to sell a Salem widow a door-plate ; and when she gave him her name to be engraved on it , gave only her surname , objecting to any first name or initials , observing : “ I might get married again , and if my initials or first name were on the plate , it would be of no use . If they are left off , the plate could be used by my son . ”</p>
   <p>Thus much about collecting book-plates . One word may be tolerated about the character of one 's own book-plate . To my taste , mere coats-of-arms with mottoes are not the best form . They simply denote ownership . They might well answer some further purpose , as for example to typify the peculiar tastes of the proprietor in respect to his books . A portrait of the owner is not objectionable , indeed is quite welcome in connection with some device or motto pertaining to books and not to mere family descent . But why , although a collector may have a favorite author , like Hawthorne or Thackeray , for example , should he insert his portrait in his book-plate , as is often done ? Mr. Howells would writhe in his grave if he knew that somebody had stuck Thackeray 's portrait or Scott 's in “ Silas Lapham , ” and those Calvinists who think that the “ Scarlet Letter ” is wicked , would pronounce damnation on the man who should put the gentle Hawthorne 's portrait in a religious book . To be sure , one might have a variety of book-plates , with portraits appropriate to different kinds of books — Napoleon 's for military , Calvin for religious , Walton 's for angling and a composite portrait of Howells-James for fiction of the photographic school ; but this would involve expense and destroy the intrinsic unity desirable in the book-plate . So let the portrait , if any , be either that of the proprietor or a conventional image . If I were to relax and allow a single exception it would be in favor of dear Charles Lamb 's portrait in “ Fraser 's , ” representing him as reading a book by candle light . ( For the moment this idea pleases me so much that I feel half inclined to eat all my foregoing words on this point , and adopt it for myself . At any rate , I hereby preempt the privilege . )</p>
   <p>I have referred to Mr. Lang 's antipathy to book-plate collectors , and while , as I have observed , he goes to extravagant lengths in condemning their pursuit , still it may be of interest to my readers to know just what he says about them , and so I reproduce below a ballad on the subject , with ( the material for ) which he kindly supplied me when I solicited his mild expression of opinion on the subject :</p>

    <head>THE BOOK-AUCTIONEER .</head>
     <l n="1">There is one figure that stands in a very unpleasant relation to books .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>If anybody has any curiosity to know what I consider the most undesirable occupation of mankind , I will answer candidly — that of an auctioneer of private libraries . It does not seem to have fallen into disrepute like that of the headsman or hangman , and perhaps it is as unpleasantly essential as that of the undertaker . But it generally thrives on the unhappiness of those who are compelled to part with their books , on the rivalries of the rich , and the strifes of the trade . It was urged against Mr. Cleveland , on his first canvass for the Presidency , that when he was sheriff he had hanged a murderer . For my own part , I admired him for performing that solemn office himself rather than hiring an underling to do it . But if he had been a book-auctioneer , I might have been prejudiced against him .</p>
   <p>Not so ignoble and inhuman perhaps as that of the slave-seller , still the business must breed a sort of callousness which is abhorrent to the genial Book-Worm . How I hate the glib rattle of his tongue , the mouldiness of his jests and the transparency of his puffery ! I should think he would hate himself . It must be worse than acting Hamlet or Humpty Dumpty a hundred consecutive nights . Dante had no punishment for the Book-Worm in hell , if I remember right , but if he deserved any pitiless reprobation , it would be found in compelling him to cry off books to all eternity . Grant that the auctioneer is a person of sensibility and acquainted with good books , then his calling must give him many a pang as he observes the ignorance and carelessness of his audience . It is better and more fitting that he should know little of his wares . He ought to be well paid for his work , and he is — no man gets so much for mere talk except the lawyer , and perhaps not even he . I do not so much complain of his favoritism . When there is something especially desirable going , I frequently fail to catch his eye , and my rival gets the prize . But in this he is no worse than the Speaker . On the other hand he sometimes loads me up with a thing that I do not want , and in possession of which I would be unwilling to be found dead , pretending that I winked at him — a species of imposition which it is impolitic to resent for fear of being entirely ignored . These discretionary favors are regarded as a practical joke and must not be declined . But what I do complain of is his commercial stolidity , surpassing that of Charles Surface when he sold the portraits of his ancestors . The “ bete noir ” of the book trade is</p>

   <p>I speak feelingly , but I think it is pardonable . I once went through an auction sale of my own books , and while I lost money on volumes on which I had bestowed much thought , labor and expense , I made a profit on Gibbon 's “ Decline and Fall ” in tree-calf . I do not complain of the loss ; what I was mortified by was the profit . But the auctioneer was not at all abashed ; in fact he seemed rather pleased , and apparently regarded it as a feather in his cap . I have always suspected that the shameless purchaser was Silas Wegg .</p>
   <p>XI .</p>
   <p>THE BOOKSELLER .</p>
   <p>Considering his importance in modern civilization , it is singular that so little has been recorded of the Bookseller in literature . Shakespeare has a great deal to say of books of various kinds , but not a word , I believe , of the Bookseller . It is true that Ursa Major gave a mitigated growl of applause to the booksellers , if I recollect my Boswell right , and he condescended to write a life of Cave , but bookseller in his view meant publisher . It is true that Charles Knight wrote a book entitled “ Shadows of the Old Booksellers , ” but here too the characters were mainly publishers , and his account of them is indeed shadowy . The chief thing that I recall about any of the booksellers thus celebrated is that Tom Davies had “ a pretty wife , ” which is probably the reason why Doctor Johnson thought Tom would better have stuck to the stage . So far as I know , the most vivid pen-pictures of booksellers are those depicting the humble members of the craft , the curb-stone venders . They are much more picturesque than their more affluent brethren who are used to the luxury of a roof .</p>
   <p>Rummaging over the contents of an old stall , at a half book , half old iron shop in Ninety-four alley , leading from Wardour street to Soho , yesterday , I lit upon a ragged duodecimo , which has been the strange delight of my infancy ; the price demanded was sixpence , which the owner ( a little squab duodecimo of a character himself ) enforced with the assurance that his own mother should not have it for a farthing less . On my demurring to this extraordinary assertion , the dirty little vender reinforced his assertion with a sort of oath , which seemed more than the occasion demanded . “ And now , ” said he , “ I have put my soul to it . ” Pressed by so solemn an asseveration , I could no longer resist a demand which seemed to set me , however unworthy , upon a level with his nearest relations ; and depositing a tester , I bore away the battered prize in triumph .</p>
   <p>— Essays of Elia .</p>
   <p>Monsieur Uzanne , who has treated of the elegancies of the Fan , the Muff , and the Umbrella , has more recently given the world a quite unique series of studies among the bookstalls and the quays of Paris — “ The Book Hunter in Paris ” — and this too one finds more entertaining than any account of Quaritch 's or Putnam 's shop would be .</p>
   <p>I must bear witness to the honesty and liberality of booksellers . When one considers the hundreds of catalogues from which he has ordered books at a venture , even from across the ocean , and how seldom he has been misled or disappointed in the result , one cannot subscribe to a belief in the dogma of total depravity . I remember some of my booksellers with positive affection . They were such self-denying men to consent to part with their treasures at any price . And as a rule they are far more careless than ordinary merchants about getting or securing their pay . To be sure it is rather ignoble for the painter of a picture , or the chiseller of a statue , or the vender of a fine book , to affect the acuteness of tradesmen in the matter of compensation . The excellent bookseller takes it for granted , if he stoops to think about it , that if a man orders a Caxton or a Grolier he will pay for it , at his convenience . It was this unthinking liberality which led a New York bookseller to give credit to a distinguished person — afterwards a candidate for the Presidency — to a considerable amount , and to let the account stand until it was outlawed , and his sensibilities were greviously shocked , when being compelled to sue for his due , his debtor pleaded the statute of limitations ! His faith was not restored even when the acute buyer left a great sum of money by his will to found a public library , and the legacy failed through informality .</p>
   <p>I have only one complaint to make against booksellers . They should teach their clerks to recognize The Book-Worm at a glance . It is very annoying , when I go browsing around a book-shop , to have an attendant come up and ask me , who have bought books for thirty years , if he can “ show me anything ” — just as if I wanted to see anything in particular — or if “ anybody is waiting on me ” — when all I desire is to be let alone . Some booksellers , I am convinced , have this art of recognition , for they let me alone , and I make it a rule always to buy something of them , but never when their employees are so annoyingly attentive . I do not object to being watched ; it is only the implication that I need any assistance that offends me . It is easy to recognize the Book-Worm at a glance by the care with which he handles the rare books and the indifference with which he passes the standard authors in holiday bindings .</p>
   <p>Once I had a bookseller who had a talent for drawing , which he used to exercise occasionally on the exterior of an express package of books . One of these wrappings I have preserved , exhibiting a pen-and-ink drawing of a war-ship firing a big gun at a few small birds . Perhaps this was satirically intended to denote the pains and time he had expended on so small a sale . But I will now immortalize him .</p>
   <p>The most striking picture of a bookseller that I recall in all literature is one drawn by M. Uzanne , in the charming book mentioned above , which I will endeavor to transmute and transmit under the title of</p>

   <p>THE PUBLIC LIBRARIAN .</p>
   <p>There is one species of the Book-Worm which is more pitiable than the Bookseller , and that is the Public Librarian , especially of a circulating library . He is condemned to live among great collections of books and exhibit them to the curious public , and to be debarred from any proprietorship in them , even temporary . But the greater part this does not grieve a true Book-Worm , for he would scorn ownership of a vast majority of the books which he shows , but on the comparatively rare occasions when he is called on to produce a real book ( in the sense of Bibliomania ) , he must be saddened by the reflection that it is not his own , and that the inspection of it is demanded of him as a matter of right . I have often observed the ill concealed reluctance with which the librarian complies with such a request ; how he looks at the demandant with a degree of surprise , and then produces the key of the repository where the treasure is kept under guard , and heaving a sigh delivers the volume with a grudging hand . It was this characteristic which led me in my youth , before I had been inducted into the delights of Bibliomania and had learned to appreciate the feelings of a librarian , to define him as one who conceives it to be his duty to prevent the public from seeing the books . I owe a good old librarian an apology for having said this of him , and hereby offer my excuses to one whose honorable name is recorded in the Book of Life . Much is to be forgiven to the man who loves books , and yet is doomed to deal out books that perish in the using , which no human being would ever read a second time nor “ be found dead with . ” These are the true tests of a good book , especially the last . Shelley died with a little AEschylus on his person , which the cruel waves spared , and when Tennyson fell asleep it was with a Shakespeare , open at “ Cymbeline . ” One may be excused for reading a good deal that he never would re-read , but not for owning it , nor for owning a good deal which he would feel ashamed to have for his last earthly companion . But now for my tribute to</p>

    <p>XIII .</p>
   <p>DOES BOOK COLLECTING PAY .</p>
   <p>We now come to the sordid but serious consideration whether books are a “ good investment ” in the financial sense . The mind of every true Book-Worm should revolt from this question , for none except a bookseller is pardonable for buying books with the design of selling them . Booksellers are a necessary evil , as purveyors for the Book-Worm . I regard them as the old woman regarded the thirty-nine articles of faith ; when inquired of by her bishop what she thought of them , she said , “ I do n't know as I 've anything against them . ” So I do n't know that I have anything against booksellers , although I must concede that they generally have something against me . As no well regulated man ever grudges expense on the house that forms his home , or on its adornment , and rarely cares or even reflects whether he can get his money back , so it is with the true bibliomaniac . He never intends to part with his books any more than with his homestead . Then again the use and enjoyment of books ought to count for something like interest on the capital invested . Many times , directly or indirectly , the use of a library is worth even more than the interest on the outlay . It is singular how expenditure in books is regarded as an extravagance by the business world . One may spend the price of a fine library in fast or showy horses , or in travel , or in gluttony , or in stock speculations eventuating on the wrong side of his ledger , and the money-grubbing community think none the worse of him . But let him expend annually a few thousands in books , and these sons of Mammon pull long faces , wag their shallow heads , and sneeringly observe , “ screw loose somewhere , ” “ never get half what he has paid for them , ” “ too much of a Book-Worm to be a sharp business man . ” A man who boldly bets on stocks in Wall Street is a gallant fellow , forsooth , and excites the admiration of the business community ( especially of those who thrive on his losses ) even when he “ comes out at the little end of the horn . ” As Ruskin observes , we frequently hear of a bibliomaniac , never of a horse-maniac . It is said there is a private stable in Syracuse , New York , which has cost several hundred thousand dollars . The owner is regarded as perfectly sane and the building is viewed with great pride by the public , but if the owner had expended as much on a private library his neighbors would have thought him a lunatic . If a man in business wants to excite the suspicion of the sleek gentlemen who sit around the discount board with him , or yell like lunatics at the stock exchange with him , or talk with him about the tariff or free silver , or any other subject on which no two men ever agree unless it is for their interest , let it leak out that he has put a few thousand dollars into a Mazarine Bible , or a Caxton , or a first folio Shakespeare or some other rare book . No matter if he can afford it , most of his associates regard him as they do a Bedlamite who goes about collecting straws . Fortunate is he if his wife does not privately call on the family attorney and advise with him about putting a committee over the poor man .</p>
   <p>But if we must regard book-buying in a money sense , and were to admit that books never sell for as much as they cost , it is no worse in respect to books than in respect to any other species of personal property . What chattel is there for which the buyer can get as much as he paid , even the next day ? When it is proposed to transform the seller himself into the buyer of the same article , we find that the bull of yesterday is converted into the bear of to-day . Circumstances alter cases . I have bought a good many books and “ objects of bigotry and virtue , ” and have sold some , and the nearest I ever came to getting as much as I paid was in the case of a rare print , the seller of which , after the lapse of several years , solicited me to let him have it again , at exactly what I paid for it , in order that he might sell it to some one else at an advance . I declined his offer with profuse thanks , and keep the picture as a curiosity .</p>
   <p>So I should say , as a rule , that books are not a good financial investment in the business sense , and speaking of most books and most buyers . Give a man the same experience in buying books that renders him expert in buying other personal property , the mere gross objects of trade , and let him set out with the purpose of accumulating a library that shall be a remunerative financial investment , and he may succeed , indeed , has often succeeded , certainly to the extent of getting back his outlay with interest , and sometimes making a handsome profit . But this needs experience . Just as one must build at least two houses before he can exactly suit himself , so he must collect two libraries before he can get one that will prove a fair investment in the vulgar sense of trade .</p>
   <p>I dare say that one will frequently pay more for a fine microscope or telescope than he can ever obtain for it if he desires or is pressed to sell it , but who would or should stop to think of that ? The power of prying into the mysteries of the earth and the wonders of the heavens should raise one 's thoughts above such petty considerations . So it should be in buying that which enables one to converse with Shakespeare or Milton or scan the works of Raphael or Durer . When the pioneer on the western plains purchases an expensive rifle he does not inquire whether he can sell it for what it costs ; his purpose is to defend his house against Indians and other wild beasts . So the true book-buyer buys books to fight weariness , disgust , sorrow and despair ; to loose himself from the world and forget time and all its limitations and besetments . In this view they never cost too much . And so when asked if book-collecting pays , I retort by asking , does piety pay ? “ Honesty is the best policy ” is the meanest of maxims . Honesty ought to be a principle and not a policy ; and book-collecting ought to be a means of education , refinement and enjoyment , and not a mode of financial investment .</p>
   <p>XIV .</p>
   <p>THE BOOK-WORM 'S FAULTS .</p>
   <p>This is not a case of “ Snakes in Iceland , ” for the Book-Worm has faults . One of his faults is his proneness to regard books as mere merchandise and not as vehicles of intellectual profit , that is to say , to be read . Too many collectors buy books simply for their rarity and with too little regard to the value of their contents . The Circassian slave-dealer does not care whether his girls can talk sense or not , and too many men buy books with a similar disregard to their capacity for instructing or entertaining . It seems to me that a man who buys books which he does not read , and especially such as he cannot read , merely on account of their value as merchandise , degrades the noble passion of bibliomania to the level of a trade . When I go through such a library I think of what Christ said to the traders in the Temple . Another fault is his lack of independence and his tendency to imitate the recognized leaders . He is too prone to buy certain books simply because another has them , and thus even rare collections are apt to fall into a tiresome routine . The collector who has a hobby and independence to ride it is admirable . Let him addict himself to some particular subject or era or “ ana , ” and try to exhaust it , and before he is conscious he will have accumulated a collection precious for its very singularity . It strikes me that the best example of this idea that I have ever heard of is the attempt , in which two collectors in this country are engaged , to acquire the first or at least one specimen of every one of the five hundred fifteenth century printers . If this should ever succeed , the great libraries of all the world would be eager for it , and the undertaking is sufficiently arduous to last a lifetime .</p>
   <p>Sometimes out of this fault , sometimes independently of it , arises the fault by which book collecting degenerates into mere rivalry — the vulgar desire of display and ambition for a larger or rarer or costlier accumulation than one 's neighbor has . The determination not to be outdone does not lend dignity or worth to the pursuit which would otherwise be commendable . During the late civil war in this country the chaplain of a regiment informed his colonel , who was not a godly person , that there was a hopeful revival of religion going on in a neighboring and rival regiment , and that forty men had been converted and baptized . “ Dashed if I will submit to that , ” said the swearing colonel : “ Adjutant , detail fifty men for baptism instantly ! ” So Mr. Roe , hearing that Mr. Doe has acquired a Caxton or other rarity of a certain height , and absolutely flawless except that the corners of the last leaf have been skillfully mended and that six leaves are slightly foxed , cannot rest night or day for envy , but is like the troubled sea until he can find a copy a sixteenth of an inch taller , the corners of whose leaves are in their pristine integrity , and over whose brilliant surface the smudge of the fox has not been cast , and then how high is his exaltation ! Not that he cares anything for the book intrinsically , but he glories in having beaten Doe . Now if any speaks to him of Doe 's remarkable copy , he can draw out his own and create a surprise in the bosom of Doe 's adherent . The laurels of Miltiades no longer deprive him of rest . He has overcome in this trivial and childish strife concerning size and condition , and he holds the champion 's belt for the present . He not only feels big himself but he has succeeded in making Doe feel small , which is still better . I do n't know whether there will be any book-collecting in Mr. Bellamy 's Utopia , but if there is , it will not be disfigured by such meanness , but collectors will go about striving to induce others to accept their superior copies and everything will be as lovely as in Heine 's heaven , where geese fly around ready cooked , and if one treads on your corn it conveys a sensation of exquisite delight .</p>
   <p>It has been several times remarked by moralists that human nature is selfish . One of course does not expect another to relinquish to him his place in a “ queue ” at a box-office or his turn at a barber 's shop , but in the noble and elegant pursuit of book-collecting it would be well to emulate the politeness of the French at Fontenoy , and hat in hand offer our antagonist the first shot . But I believe the only place where the Book-Worm ever does that is the auction room .</p>
   <p>I no sooner come into the library , but I bolt the door to me , excluding lust , ambition , avarice , and all such vices , whose nurse is idleness , the mother of ignorance , and melancholy herself , and in the very lap of eternity , among so many divine souls , I take my seat with so lofty a spirit and sweet content , that I pity all our great ones and rich men that know not this happiness .</p>
   <p>— Heinsius .</p>
   <p>The modern Book-Worm is not the simple and absent-minded creature who went by this name a century ago or more . He is no mere antiquarian , Dryasdust or Dominie Sampson , but he is a sharp merchant , or a relentless broker , or a professional railroad wrecker , or a keen lawyer , or a busy physician , or a great manufacturer — a wide awake man of affairs , quite devoid of the conventional innocency and credulity which formerly made the name of Book-Worm suggestive of a necessity for a guardian or a committee in lunacy . No longer does he inquire , as Becatello inquired of Alphonso , King of Naples , which had done the better — Poggius , who sold a Livy , fairly writ in his own hand , to buy a country home near Florence , or he , who to buy a Livy had sold a piece of land ? No longer is the scale turned in the negotiation of a treaty between princes by the weight of a rare book , as when Cosimo dei Medici persuaded King Alphonso of Naples to a peace by sending him a codex of Livy . No longer does the Book-Worm sit in his modest book-room , absorbed in his adored volumes , heedless of the waning lamp and the setting star , of hunger and thirst , unmindful of the scent of the clover wafted in at the window , deaf to the hum of the bees and the low of the kine , blind to the glow of sunsets and the soft contour of the blue hills , and the billowy swaying of the wheat field before the gentle breath of the south . No longer can it be said that</p>

   <p>The modern Book-Worm deals in sums of six figures ; he keeps an agent “ on the other side ; ” he cables his demands and his decisions ; his name flutters the dovecotes in the auction-room ; to him is proffered the first chance at a rarity worth a King 's ransom ; too busy to potter in person with such a trifle as the purchase of a Mazarine Bible , he hires others to do the hunting and he merely receives the game ; the tiger skin and the elephant 's tusk are laid at his feet to order , but he misses all the joy and ardor of the hunt . How different is all this from Sir Thomas Urquhart 's account of his own library , of which he says : “ There were not three works therein which were not of mine own purchase , and all of them together , in the order wherein I had ranked them , compiled like to a complete nosegay of flowers , which in my travels I had gathered out of the gardens of sixteen several kingdoms . ”</p>
   <p>Another fault of the Book-Worm is the affectation of collecting books on subjects in which he takes no practical interest , simply because it is the fashion or the books are intrinsically beautiful . Many a man has a fine collection on Angling , for example , who hardly knows how to put a worm on a hook , much less attach a fly . I fear I am one of these hypocritical creatures , for this is</p>

    <p>XV .</p>
   <p>POVERTY AS A MEANS OF ENJOYMENT IN COLLECTING .</p>
   <p>Poor collectors are not only not at a disadvantage in enjoyment , but they have a positive advantage over affluent rivals . If I were rich , probably I should not throw my money away just to experience this superiority , but it nevertheless exists . I do not envy , but I commiserate my brother collector who has plenty of money . He who only has to draw his check to obtain his desire fails to reach the keenest bliss of the pursuit . If diamonds were as common as cobble stones there would be no delight in picking them up .</p>
   <p>To constitute a bibliomaniac in the true sense , the love of books must combine with a certain limitation of means for the gratification of the appetite . The consciousness of some extravagance must be always present in his mind ; there must be a sense of sacrifice in the attainment ; in a rich man the disease cannot exist ; he cannot enter the kingdom of the Bibliomaniac 's heaven . There is the same difference of sensation between the acquirement of books by a wealthy man and by him of slender purse , that there is between the taking of fish in a net and the successful result of a long angling pursuit after one especially fat and evasive trout . When a prince kills his preserved game , with keepers to raise it for him and to hand him guns ready loaded , so that all he has to do is to squint and pull the trigger , this is not hunting ; it is mere vulgar butchery . What knows he of the joys of the tramper in the forest , who stalks the deer , or scares up smaller game , singly , and has to work hard for his bag ? We read in Dibdin 's sumptuous pages of the celebrated contest between the Duke of Devonshire and the Marquis of Blandford for the possession of the Valdarfar Decameron ; we read with admiration , but we also read of the immortal battle of Elia with the little squab-keeper of the old book-stall in Ninety-four alley , over the ownership of a ragged duodecimo for a sixpence ; we read with affection . So we read Leigh Hunt 's confession that when he “ cut open a new catalogue of old books , and put crosses against dozens of volumes in the list , out of the pure imagination of buying them , the possibility being out of the question . ” Poverty hath her victories no less renowned than wealth . To haunt the book-stores , there to see a long-desired work in luxurious and tempting style , reluctantly to abandon it for the present on account of the price ; to go home and dream about it , to wonder , for a year , and perchance longer , whether it will ever again greet your eyes ; to conjecture what act of desperation you might in heat of passion commit toward some more affluent man in whose possession you should thereafter find it ; to see it turn up again in another book-shop , its charms slightly faded , but yet mellowed by age , like those of your first love , met in later life — with this difference , however , that whereas you crave those of the book more than ever , you are generally quite satisfied with yourself for not having , through the greenness of youth , yielded untimely to those of the lady ; to ask with assumed indifference the price , and learn with ill-dissembled joy that it is now within your means ; to say you 'll take it ; to place it beneath your arm , and pay for it ( or more generally order it “ charged ” ) ; to go forth from that room with feelings akin to those of Ulysses when he brought away the Palladium from Troy ; to keep a watchful eye on the parcel in the railway coach on your way home , or to gloat over the treasures of its pages , and wonder if the other passengers have any suspicion of your good fortune ; and finally to place the volume on your shelf , and thenceforth to call it your own — this is indeed a pleasure denied to the affluent , so keen as to be akin to pain , and only marred by the palling which always follows possession and the presentation of your book-seller 's account three months afterwards .</p>

   <p>There was a time when I loved to see my books arranged with a view to uniformity of height and harmony of color without respect to subjects . That time I regard as my vealy period . That was the time when we admired “ Somnambula , ” and when the housewife used to have all the pictures hung on the same level , and to buy vases in pairs exactly alike and put them on either side of the parlor clock , which was generally surmounted by a prancing Saracen or a weaving Penelope . Granting that a collection is not extensive enough to demand a strict arrangement by subjects , I like to see a little artistic confusion — high and low together here and there , like a democratic community ; now and then some giants laid down on their sides to rest ; the shelves not uniformly filled out as if the owner never expected to buy any more , and alongside a dainty Angler a book in red or blue cloth with a white label — just as childred in velvet and furs sit next a newsboy , or a little girl in calico with a pigtail at Sunday School , or as beggars and princes kneel side by side on the cathedral pavement . It is good to have these “ swell ” books rub up against the commoners , which though not so elegant are frequently a great deal brighter . At a country funeral I once heard the undertaker say to the bearers , “ size yourselves off . ” There is no necessity or artistic gain in such a ceremony in a library , and a departure from stiff uniformity is quite agreeable . Then I do not care to have the book cases all of the same height , nor even of the same kind of wood , nor to have them all “ dwarfs , ” with bric-a-brac on the top . I would rather have more books on top . In short , it is pleasant to have the collection remind one in a way of Topsy — not that it was “ born , ” but “ growed ” and is expected to grow more . There is a modern notion of considering a library as a room rather than as a collection of books , and of making the front drawing-room the library , which is heretical in the eyes of a true Book-Worm . This is probably an invention of the women of the house to prevent any additions to the books without their knowledge , and to discourage book-buying . We have surrendered too much to our wives in this ; they demand book cases as furniture and to serve as shelves , without any regard to the interior contents or whether there are any , except for the color of the bindings and the regularity of the rows . All of us have thus seen “ libraries ” without books worthy the name , and book-cases sometimes with exquisite silk curtains , carefully and closely drawn , arousing the suspicion that there were no books behind them . My ideal library is a room given up to books , all by itself , at the top or in the rear of the house , where “ company ” cannot break through and say to me , “ I know you are a great man to buy books — have you seen that beautiful limited holiday edition of Ben Hur , with illustrations ? ”</p>
    <p>XVII .</p>
   <p>ENEMIES OF BOOKS .</p>
   <p>Mr. Blades regards as “ Enemies of Books ” fire , water , gas , heat , dust and neglect , ignorance and bigotry , the worm , beetles , bugs and rats , book-binders , collectors , servants and children . He does not include women , borrowers , or thieves . Perhaps he considers them rather as enemies of the book-owners . The worm is not always to be considered an enemy to authors , although he may be to books . James Payn , in speaking of the recent discovery , in the British Museum , of a copy on papyrus of the humorous poems of the obscure Greek poet , Herodles , says : “ The humorous poems of Herodles possess , however , the immense advantage of being ‘ seriously mutilated by worms ’ ; wherever therefore an hiatus occurs , the charitable and cultured mind will be enabled to conclude that ( as in the case of a second descent upon a ball supper ) the ‘ best things ’ have been already devoured . ” It was doubtless to guard against thieves that the ancient books were chained up in the monasteries , but the practice was effectual also against borrowers . De Bury , in his “ Philobiblon ” has a chapter entitled “ A Provident Arrangement by which his Books may be lent to Strangers , ” in which the utmost leniency is to lend duplicate books upon ample security . Not to adopt the harsh judgment of an ancient author , who says , “ to lend a book is to lose it , and borrowing but a hypocritical pretense for stealing , ” we may conclude , in a word , that to lend a book is like the Presidency of the United States , to be neither desired nor refused . Collectors are not so much exposed to the ravages of thieves as book-sellers are , and a book-thief ought to be regarded with leniency for his good taste and his reliance on the existence of culture in others . After all , it is one 's own fault if he lends a book . One should as soon think of lending one of his children , unless he has duplicate or triplicate daughters . It would be difficult to foretell what would happen to a man who should propose to borrow a rare book . Perhaps death by freezing would be the safest prediction . Although Grolier stamped “ et amicorum ” on his books , that did not mean that he would lend them , but only that his friends were free of them at his house . It is amusing to note , in Mr. Castle 's monograph on Book-Plates , how many of them indicate a stern purpose not to lend books . Mr. Gosse regards book-plates as a precaution not only against thieves , but against borrowers . He observes of the man who does not adopt a book-plate : “ Such a man is liable to great temptations . He is brought face to face with that enemy of his species , the borrower , and does not speak with him in the gate . If he had a book-plate he would say , ‘ Oh ! certainly I will lend you this volume , if it has not my book-plate in it ; of course one makes it a rule never to lend a book that has . ’ He would say this and feign to look inside the volume , knowing right well that this safeguard against the borrower is there already . ” One may make a gift of a book to a friend , but there is as much difference between giving a book and lending one as there is between indorsing a note and giving the money . I have considerable respect for and sympathy with a good honest book-thief . He holds out no false hopes and makes no false pretences . But the borrower who does not return adds hypocrisy and false pretences to other crime . He ought to be committed to the State prison for life , and put at keeping the books of the institution . In a buried temple in Cnidos , in 1857 , Mr. Newton found rolls of lead hung up , on which were inscribed spells devoting enemies to the infernal gods for sundry specified offenses , among which was the failure to return a borrowed garment . On which Agnes Repplier says : “ Would that it were given to me now to inscribe , and by inscribing doom , all those who have borrowed and failed to return our books ; would that by scribbling some strong language on a piece of lead we could avenge the lamentable gaps on our shelves , and send the ghosts of the wrong-doers howling dismally into the eternal shades of Tartarus . ”</p>
   <p>I have spoken of a certain amount of sympathy as due from a magnanimous book-owner toward a pilferer of such wares . This is always on the condition that he steals to add to his own hoard and not for mere pecuniary gain . The following is suggested as a Christian mode of dealing with</p>

   <p>It greatly rejoices me to observe that Mr. Blades does not include tobacco among the enemies of books . In one sense tobacco may be ranked as a book-enemy , for self-denial in this regard may furnish a man with a good library in a few years . I have known a very pretty collection made out of the ordinary smoke-offerings of twenty years . Undoubtedly there are libraries so fine that smoking in them would be discountenanced , but mine is not impervious to the pipe or cigar , and I entertain the pleasing fancy that tobacco-smoke is good for books , disinfects them , and keeps them free from the destroying worm . As I do not myself smoke , I like to see my friends taking their ease in my book-room , with the “ smoke of their torment ascending ” above my modest volumes . I know how they feel , without incurring the expense , and so to them I indite and dedicate</p>

   <p>In the early history of New England , when the town of Deerfield was burned by the Indians , Captain Dunstan , who was the father of a large family , deeming discretion the better part of valor , made up his mind to run for it and to take one child ( as a sample , probably ) , that being all he could safely carry on his horse . But on looking about him , he could not determine which child to take , and so observing to his wife , “ All or none , ” he set her and the baby on the horse , and brought up the rear on foot with his gun , and fended off the redskins and brought the whole family into safety . Such is the tale , and in the old primer there was a picture of the scene — although I do not understand that it was taken from the life , and the story reflects small credit on the character of the aborigines for enterprise .</p>
   <p>I have often conjectured which of my books I would save in case of fire in my library , and whether I should care to rescue any if I could not bring off all . Perhaps the problem would work itself out as follows :</p>

   <p>It has been hereinbefore intimated that women may be classed among the enemies of books . There is at least one time of the year when every Book-Worm thinks so , and that is the dread period of house-cleaning — sometimes in the spring , sometimes in the autumn , and sometimes , in the case of excessively finical housewives , in both .

   <p>LIBRARY COMPANIONS .</p>
   <p>As a rule I do not care for any constant human companion in my library , but I do not object to a cat or a small dog . That picture of Montaigne , drawn by himself , amusing his cat with a garter , or that other one of Doctor Johnson feeding oysters to his cat Hodge , is a very pleasing one . In my library hangs Durer 's picture of St. Jerome in his cell , busy with his writing , and a dog and a lion quietly dozing together in the foreground . As I am no saint I have never been able to keep a lion in my library for any great length of time , but I have maintained a dog there . Lamb even contended that his books were the better for being dog'shYpppHeNeared , but I do not go so far as that . Nor do I pretend that his presence will prevent the books from becoming foxed . Here is a portrait of</p>

    <head>MY DOG .</head>
     <l n="1">He is a trifling , homely beast ,</l>
     <l n="2">Of no use , or the very least ;</l>
     <l n="3">To shake imaginary rat</l>
     <l n="4">Or bark for hours at china cat ;</l>
     <l n="5">To lie at head of stairs and start ,</l>
     <l n="6">Like animated , woolly dart ,</l>
     <l n="7">Upon a non-existent foe ;</l>
     <l n="8">Or on hind legs like monkey go ,</l>
     <l n="9">To beg for sugar or for bone ;</l>
     <l n="10">Never content to be alone ;</l>
     <l n="11">To bask for hours in the sun .</l>
     <l n="12">Rolled up till head and tail are one ;</l>
     <l n="13">Usurping all the softest places</l>
     <l n="14">And keeping them with doggish graces ;</l>
     <l n="15">To sneak between the housemaid 's feet</l>
     <l n="16">And scour unnoticed on the street ;</l>
     <l n="17">Wag indefatigable tail ;</l>
     <l n="18">Cajole with piteous human wail ;</l>
     <l n="19">To dance with dainty dandy air</l>
     <l n="20">When nicely parted is his hair ,</l>
     <l n="21">And look most ancient and dejected</l>
     <l n="22">When it has been too long neglected ;</l>
     <l n="23">To sleep upon my book-den rug</l>
     <l n="24">And dream of battle with a pug ;</l>
     <l n="25">To growl with counterfeited rabies ;</l>
     <l n="26">To be more trouble than twin babies ;—</l>
     <l n="27">These are the qualities and tricks</l>
     <l n="28">That in my heart his image fix ;</l>
     <l n="29">And so in cursory , doggerel rhyme</l>
     <l n="30">I celebrate him in his time ,</l>
     <l n="31">Nor wait his virtues to rehearse</l>
     <l n="32">In cold obituary verse .</l>

   <p>Among the silent companions in my study are the effigies of the four greatest geniuses of modern times in the realms of literature , art , music and war — a print of Shakespeare ; one of Michael Angelo 's corrugated face with its broken nose ; a bust of Beethoven , resembling a pouting lion ; and a print of Napoleon at St. Helena , representing him dressed in a white duck suit , with a broad-brimmed straw hat , and sitting looking seaward , with those unfathomable eyes , a newspaper lying in his lap . Unhappy faces all except the first — his cheerful , probably because he has effected an arrangement with an otherwise idle person , named Bacon , to do all his work for him . But there is another portrait , at which I look oftener , the original of which probably takes more interest in me , but is unknown to every visitor to my study . I myself have not seen her in half a century . I call it simply</p>

   <p>Of course my chief occupation in my library is reading and writing . To be sure , I do a good deal of thinking there . But there is another occupation which I practice to a great extent , which does not involve reading or writing at all , nor thinking to any considerable degree . That is playing solitaire . I play only one kind of this and that I have played for many years . It requires two packs of cards , and requires building on the aces and kings , and so I have them tacked down on a lap-board to save picking out and laying down every time . This particular game is called “ St. Elba , ” probably because Napoleon did not play it , and it can be “ won ” once in about sixty trials . I do not care for card-playing with others , but I have certain reasons for liking</p>

   <p>THE FRIENDSHIP OF BOOKS .</p>
   <p>To many peaceful men of the legal robe the companionship of books is inexpressibly dear . What a privilege it is to summon the greatest and most charming spirits of the past from their graves , and find them always willing to talk to us ! How delightful to go to our well-known book-shelves , lay hands on our favorite authors — even in the dark , so well do we know them — take any volume , open it at any page , and in a few minutes lose all sense and remembrance of the real world , with its strife , its bitterness , its disappointments , its hollowness , its unfaithfulness , its selfishness , in the pictures of an ideal world ! The real world , do we say ? Which is the real world , that of history or that of fiction ? In this age of historic doubt and iconoclasm , are not the heroes of our favorite romances much more real than those of history ? Captain Ed'ard Cuttle , mariner , is much more real to us than Captain Joseph Cook ; Cooper 's Two Admirals than the great Nelson ; Leather-Stocking than the yellow-haired Custer ; Henry Esmond than any of the Pretenders ; Hester Prynne and Becky Sharp than Catherine of Russia or Aspasia or Lucrezia ; Sidney Carton than Philip Sidney . Even the kings and heroes who have lived in history live more vividly for us in romance . We know the crooked Richard and the crafty Louis XI . most familiarly , if not most accurately , through Shakespeare and Scott ; and where in history do we get so haunting a picture of the great Napoleon and Waterloo as in Victor Hugo 's wondrous but inaccurate chapter ? Happy is the man who has for his associates David , Solomon , Job , Paul , and John , in spite of the assaults of modern criticism upon the Scriptures ! No one can shake our faith in Don Quixote , although the accounts of the Knight “ without fear and without reproach ” are so short and vague . There is no doubt about the travels of Christian , although those of Stanley may be questioned . The Vicar of Wakefield is a much more actual personage than Peter who preached the Crusades . Sir Roger de Coverley and his squire life are much more probable to us than Sir William Temple in his gardens . There is no character in romance who has not or might not have lived , but we are thrown into grave doubts of the saintly Washington and the devilish Napoleon depicted three quarters of a century ago . We cast history aside in scepticism and disgust ; we cling to romance with faith and delight . “ The things that are seen are temporal ; the things that are not seen are eternal . ” So let the writer hereof sing a song in praise of</p>
