    <head>TO J. M .</head>
     <l n="1">Let Fate or Insufficiency provide</l>
     <l n="2">Mean ends for men who what they are would be :</l>
     <l n="3">Penned in their narrow day no change they see</l>
     <l n="4">Save one which strikes the blow to brutes and pride .</l>
     <l n="5">Our faith is ours and comes not on a tide :</l>
     <l n="6">And whether Earth 's great offspring , by decree ,</l>
     <l n="7">Must rot if they abjure rapacity ,</l>
     <l n="8">Not argument but effort shall decide .</l>
     <l n="9">They number many heads in that hard flock :</l>
     <l n="10">Trim swordsmen they push forth : yet try thy steel .</l>
     <l n="11">Thou , fighting for poor humankind , wilt feel</l>
     <l n="12">The strength of Roland in thy wrist to hew</l>
     <l n="13">A chasm sheer into the barrier rock ,</l>
     <l n="14">And bring the army of the faithful through .</l>

    <head>TIME AND SENTIMENT</head>
     <l n="1">I see a fair young couple in a wood ,</l>
     <l n="2">And as they go , one bends to take a flower ,</l>
     <l n="3">That so may be embalmed their happy hour ,</l>
     <l n="4">And in another day , a kindred mood ,</l>
     <l n="5">Haply together , or in solitude ,</l>
     <l n="6">Recovered what the teeth of Time devour ,</l>
     <l n="7">The joy , the bloom , and the illusive power ,</l>
     <l n="8">Wherewith by their young blood they are endued</l>
     <l n="9">To move all enviable , framed in May ,</l>
     <l n="10">And of an aspect sisterly with Truth :</l>
     <l n="11">Yet seek they with Time 's laughing things to wed :</l>
     <l n="12">Who will be prompted on some pallid day</l>
     <l n="13">To lift the hueless flower and show that dead ,</l>
     <l n="14">Even such , and by this token , is their youth .</l>

    <head>LUCIFER IN STARLIGHT</head>
     <l n="1">On a starred night Prince Lucifer uprose .</l>
     <l n="2">Tired of his dark dominion swung the fiend</l>
     <l n="3">Above the rolling ball in cloud part screened ,</l>
     <l n="4">Where sinners hugged their spectre of repose .</l>
     <l n="5">Poor prey to his hot fit of pride were those .</l>
     <l n="6">And now upon his western wing he leaned ,</l>
     <l n="7">Now his huge bulk o'er Afric 's sands careened ,</l>
     <l n="8">Now the black planet shadowed Arctic snows .</l>
     <l n="9">Soaring through wider zones that pricked his scars</l>
     <l n="10">With memory of the old revolt from Awe ,</l>
     <l n="11">He reached a middle height , and at the stars ,</l>
     <l n="12">Which are the brain of heaven , he looked , and sank .</l>
     <l n="13">Around the ancient track marched , rank on rank ,</l>
     <l n="14">The army of unalterable law .</l>

    <head>THE STAR SIRIUS</head>
     <l n="1">Bright Sirius ! that when Orion pales</l>
     <l n="2">To dotlings under moonlight still art keen</l>
     <l n="3">With cheerful fervour of a warrior 's mien</l>
     <l n="4">Who holds in his great heart the battle-scales :</l>
     <l n="5">Unquenched of flame though swift the flood assails ,</l>
     <l n="6">Reducing many lustrous to the lean :</l>
     <l n="7">Be thou my star , and thou in me be seen</l>

     <l n="9">Long watches through , at one with godly night ,</l>

    <head>SENSE AND SPIRIT</head>
     <l n="1">The senses loving Earth or well or ill</l>
     <l n="2">Ravel yet more the riddle of our lot .</l>
     <l n="3">The mind is in their trammels , and lights not</l>
     <l n="4">By trimming fear-bred tales ; nor does the will</l>
     <l n="5">To find in nature things which less may chill</l>
     <l n="6">An ardour that desires , unknowing what .</l>
     <l n="7">Till we conceive her living we go distraught ,</l>
     <l n="8">At best but circle-windsails of a mill .</l>
     <l n="9">Seeing she lives , and of her joy of life</l>
     <l n="10">Creatively has given us blood and breath</l>
     <l n="11">For endless war and never wound unhealed ,</l>
     <l n="12">The gloomy Wherefore of our battle-field</l>
     <l n="13">Solves in the Spirit , wrought of her through strife</l>
     <l n="14">To read her own and trust her down to death .</l>

    <head>EARTH 'S SECRET</head>
     <l n="1">Not solitarily in fields we find</l>
     <l n="2">Earth 's secret open , though one page is there ;</l>
     <l n="3">Her plainest , such as children spell , and share</l>
     <l n="4">With bird and beast ; raised letters for the blind .</l>
     <l n="5">Not where the troubled passions toss the mind ,</l>
     <l n="6">In turbid cities , can the key be bare .</l>
     <l n="7">It hangs for those who hither thither fare ,</l>
     <l n="8">Close interthreading nature with our kind .</l>
     <l n="9">They , hearing History speak , of what men were ,</l>
     <l n="10">And have become , are wise . The gain is great</l>
     <l n="11">In vision and solidity ; it lives .</l>
     <l n="12">Yet at a thought of life apart from her ,</l>
     <l n="13">Solidity and vision lose their state ,</l>
     <l n="14">For Earth , that gives the milk , the spirit gives .</l>

    <head>INTERNAL HARMONY</head>
     <l n="1">Assured of worthiness we do not dread</l>

     <l n="3">And greeting in the lists where we may fail :</l>
     <l n="4">Must , if we bear an aim beyond the head !</l>
     <l n="5">My betters are my masters : purely fed</l>
     <l n="6">By their sustainment I likewise shall scale</l>
     <l n="7">Some rocky steps between the mount and vale ;</l>
     <l n="8">Meanwhile the mark I have and I will wed .</l>
     <l n="9">So that I draw the breath of finer air ,</l>
     <l n="10">Station is nought , nor footways laurel-strewn ,</l>
     <l n="11">Nor rivals tightly belted for the race .</l>
     <l n="12">Good speed to them ! My place is here or there ;</l>

    <head>GRACE AND LOVE</head>
     <l n="1">Two flower-enfolding crystal vases she</l>
     <l n="2">I love fills daily , mindful but of one :</l>
     <l n="3">And close behind pale morn she , like the sun</l>
     <l n="4">Priming our world with light , pours , sweet to see ,</l>
     <l n="5">Clear water in the cup , and into me</l>
     <l n="6">The image of herself : and that being done ,</l>
     <l n="7">Choice of what blooms round her fair garden run</l>
     <l n="8">In climbers or in creepers or the tree</l>
     <l n="9">She ranges with unerring fingers fine ,</l>
     <l n="10">To harmony so vivid that through sight</l>
     <l n="11">I hear , I have her heavenliness to fold</l>
     <l n="12">Beyond the senses , where such love as mine ,</l>
     <l n="13">Such grace as hers , should the strange Fates withhold</l>
     <l n="14">Their starry more from her and me , unite .</l>

     <l n="1">Earth was not Earth before her sons appeared ,</l>

     <l n="3">And thou when I lay hidden wast as morn</l>
     <l n="4">At city-windows , touching eyelids bleared ;</l>
     <l n="5">To none by her fresh wingedness endeared ;</l>
     <l n="6">Unwelcome unto revellers outworn .</l>
     <l n="7">I the last echoes of Diana 's horn</l>
     <l n="8">In woodland heard , and saw thee come , and cheered .</l>
     <l n="9">No longer wast thou then mere light , fair soul !</l>
     <l n="10">And more than simple duty moved thy feet .</l>
     <l n="11">New colours rose in thee , from fear , from shame ,</l>
     <l n="12">From hope , effused : though not less pure a scroll</l>
     <l n="13">May men read on the heart I taught to beat :</l>

    <head>THE DISCIPLINE OF WISDOM</head>
     <l n="1">Rich labour is the struggle to be wise ,</l>
     <l n="2">While we make sure the struggle cannot cease .</l>
     <l n="3">Else better were it in some bower of peace</l>
     <l n="4">Slothful to swing , contending with the flies .</l>
     <l n="5">You point at Wisdom fixed on lofty skies ,</l>
     <l n="6">As mid barbarian hordes a sculptured Greece :</l>
     <l n="7">She falls . To live and shine , she grows her fleece ,</l>
     <l n="8">Is shorn , and rubs with follies and with lies .</l>
     <l n="9">So following her , your hewing may attain</l>
     <l n="10">The right to speak unto the mute , and shun</l>
     <l n="11">That sly temptation of the illumined brain ,</l>
     <l n="12">Deliveries oracular , self-spun .</l>

     <l n="9">Nature , it is most sure , not thee admires .</l>

     <l n="10">Fearing the God they flout , the God they glut .</l>

     <l n="7">O now the down-slope of the lunatic</l>
     <l n="8">Illumine lest we redden of that brood .</l>
     <l n="9">For not since man in his first view of thee</l>
     <l n="10">Ascended to the heavens giving sign</l>
     <l n="11">Within him of deep sky and sounded sea ,</l>
     <l n="12">Did he unforfeiting thy laws transgress ;</l>

     <l n="4">When I behold one lamp that through our fen</l>

     <l n="7">From speaking to the soul of us forthright</l>
     <l n="8">What things our craven senses keep from ken .</l>
     <l n="9">This is the doing of the Christ ; the way</l>
     <l n="10">He went on earth ; the service above guile</l>
     <l n="11">To prop a tyrant creed : it sings , it shines ;</l>
     <l n="12">Cries to the Mammonites : Allay , allay</l>

      <l n="154">Here the ancient battle ends ,</l>
      <l n="155">Joining two astonished friends ,</l>
      <l n="156">Who the kiss can give and take</l>
      <l n="157">With more warmth than in that world</l>
      <l n="158">Where the tiger claws the snake ,</l>
      <l n="159">Snake her tiger clasps infurled ,</l>
      <l n="160">And the issue of their fight</l>
      <l n="161">People lands in snarling plight .</l>
      <l n="162">Here her splendid beast she leads</l>

      <l n="191">Our locks are clipped on the verge</l>
      <l n="192">Of the realm where runs no sap .</l>
      <l n="193">She said : We have looked on both !</l>

      <l n="195">Of various lights , like the froth</l>
      <l n="196">Of the storm-swollen ravine stream</l>
      <l n="197">In flame of the bolt . What links</l>

      <l n="204">Of narcissus , dark-sweet , for the cleft</l>
      <l n="205">That tutors the torrent-brook ,</l>
      <l n="206">Delaying its forceful spleen</l>
      <l n="207">With many a wind and crook</l>

      <l n="265">Before Gods , and to shepherds a fear ,</l>

      <l n="310">She wore the wan smile he had seen ,</l>
      <l n="311">As the flow of the river of Sleep ,</l>
      <l n="312">On the mouth of the Shadow-Queen .</l>
      <l n="313">In sunlight she craved to bask ,</l>

    <head>PHAETHON — ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">At the coming up of Phoebus the all-luminous charioteer ,</l>
     <l n="2">Double-visaged stand the mountains in imperial multitudes ,</l>
     <l n="3">And with shadows dappled men sing to him , Hail , O Beneficent !</l>
     <l n="4">For they shudder chill , the earth-vales , at his clouding , shudder to</l>
     <l n="5">black ;</l>
     <l n="6">In the light of him there is music thro ’ the poplar and river-sedge ,</l>
     <l n="7">Renovation , chirp of brooks , hum of the forest — an ocean-song .</l>
     <l n="8">Never pearl from ocean-hollows by the diver exultingly ,</l>
     <l n="9">In his breathlessness , above thrust , is as earth to Helios .</l>
     <l n="10">Who usurps his place there , rashest ? Aphrodite 's loved one it is !</l>
     <l n="11">To his son the flaming Sun-God , to the tender youth , Phaethon ,</l>
     <l n="12">Rule of day this day surrenders as a thing hereditary ,</l>
     <l n="13">Having sworn by Styx tremendous , for the proof of his parentage ,</l>
     <l n="14">He would grant his son 's petition , whatsoever the sign thereof .</l>
     <l n="15">Then , rejoiced , the stripling answered : ‘ Rule of day give me ; give</l>
     <l n="16">it me ,</l>
     <l n="17">Give me place that men may see me how I blaze , and transcendingly</l>
     <l n="18">I , divine , proclaim my birthright . ’ Darkened Helios , and his</l>
     <l n="19">utterance</l>
     <l n="20">Choked prophetic : ‘ O half mortal ! ’ he exclaimed in an agony ,</l>
     <l n="21">‘ O lost son of mine ! lost son ! No ! put a prayer for another thing :</l>
     <l n="22">Not for this : insane to wish it , and to crave the gift impious !</l>
     <l n="23">Cannot other gifts my godhead shed upon thee ? miraculous</l>
     <l n="24">Mighty gifts to prove a blessing , that to earth thou shalt be a joy ?</l>
     <l n="25">Gifts of healing , wherewith men walk as the Gods beneficently ;</l>
     <l n="26">As a God to sway to concord hearts of men , reconciling them ;</l>
     <l n="27">Gifts of verse , the lyre , the laurel , therewithal that thine origin</l>
     <l n="28">Shall be known even as when I strike on the string 'd shell with</l>
     <l n="29">melody ,</l>
     <l n="30">And the golden notes , like medicine , darting straight to the</l>
     <l n="31">cavities ,</l>
     <l n="32">Fill them up , till hearts of men bound as the billows , the ships</l>
     <l n="33">thereon . ’</l>
     <l n="34">Thus intently urged the Sun-God ; but the force of his eloquence</l>
     <l n="35">Was the pressing on of sea-waves scattered broad from the rocks</l>
     <l n="36">away .</l>
     <l n="37">What shall move a soul from madness ? Lost , lost in delirium ,</l>
     <l n="38">Rock-fast , the adolescent to his father , irreverent ,</l>
     <l n="39">‘ By the oath ! the oath ! thine oath ! ’ cried . The effulgent foreseer</l>
     <l n="40">then ,</l>
     <l n="41">Quivering in his loins parental , on the boy 's beaming countenance</l>
     <l n="42">Looked and moaned , and urged him for love 's sake , for sweet life 's</l>
     <l n="43">sake , to yield the claim ,</l>
     <l n="44">To abandon his mad hunger , and avert the calamity .</l>
     <l n="45">But he , vehement , passionate , called out : ‘ Let me show I am what I</l>
     <l n="46">say ,</l>
     <l n="47">That the taunts I hear be silenced : I am stung with their</l>
     <l n="48">whispering .</l>
     <l n="49">Only , Thou , my Father , Thou tell how aloft the revolving wheels ,</l>
     <l n="50">How aloft the cleaving horse-crests I may guide peremptorily ,</l>
     <l n="51">Till I drink the shadows , fire-hot , like a flower celestial ,</l>
     <l n="52">And my fellows see me curbing the fierce steeds , the dear dew-</l>
     <l n="53">drinkers :</l>
     <l n="54">Yea , for this I gaze on life 's light ; throw for this any sacrifice . ’</l>

     <l n="55">All the end foreseeing , Phoebus to his oath irrevocable</l>
     <l n="56">Bowed obedient , deploring the insanity pitiless .</l>
     <l n="57">Then the flame-outsnorting horses were led forth : it was so</l>
     <l n="58">decreed .</l>
     <l n="59">They were yoked before the glad youth by his sister-ancillaries .</l>
     <l n="60">Swift the ripple ripples follow 'd , as of aureate Helicon ,</l>
     <l n="61">Down their flanks , while they impatient pawed desire of the</l>

     <l n="63">And the bit with fury champed . Oh ! unimaginable delight !</l>
     <l n="64">Unimagined speed and splendour in the circle of upper air !</l>
     <l n="65">Glory grander than the armed host upon earth singing victory !</l>

     <l n="68">Marked that labour by his sister Phaethontiades finished , quick</l>
     <l n="69">On the slope of the car his forefoot set assured : and the morning</l>
     <l n="70">rose :</l>
     <l n="71">Seeing whom , and what a day dawned , stood the God , as in harvest</l>
     <l n="72">fields ,</l>
     <l n="73">When the reaper grasps the full sheaf and the sickle that severs it :</l>
     <l n="74">Hugged the withered head with one hand , with the other , to indicate</l>
     <l n="75">( If this woe might be averted , this immeasurable evil ) ,</l>
     <l n="76">Laid the kindling course in view , told how the reins to manipulate :</l>
     <l n="77">Named the horses fondly , fearful , caution 'd urgently betweenwhiles :</l>
     <l n="78">Their diverging tempers dwelt on , and their wantonness , wickedness ,</l>
     <l n="79">That the voice of Gods alone held in restraint ; but the voice of</l>
     <l n="80">Gods ;</l>
     <l n="81">None but Gods can curb . He spake : vain were the words : scarcely</l>
     <l n="82">listening ,</l>
     <l n="83">Mounted Phaethon , swinging reins loose , and , ‘ Behold me , companions ,</l>
     <l n="84">It is I here , I ! ’ he shouted , glancing down with supremacy ;</l>
     <l n="85">‘ Not to any of you was this gift granted ever in annals of men ;</l>
     <l n="86">I alone what only Gods can , I alone am governing day ! ’</l>
     <l n="87">Short the triumph , brief his rapture : see a hurricane suddenly</l>

     <l n="89">At the leap on yielding ether , in despite of his reprimand ,</l>

     <l n="93">Reminiscent , drifts of counsel caught confused in his arid wits ;</l>

     <l n="111">Now a wail of men to Zeus rang : from Olympus the Thunderer</l>
     <l n="112">Saw the rage of the havoc wide-mouthed , the bright car</l>

     <l n="114">Over Asia , Africa , low down ; ruin flaming over the vales ;</l>

     <l n="4">In shadow-sandals down our vale ! -</l>

     <l n="10">The tiptoe sealers tossed to fly : -</l>
     <l n="11">Thee the last thunder 's caverned peal</l>
     <l n="12">Delivered from a wailful night :</l>

     <l n="87">The silver finger of it laughed</l>
     <l n="88">Along the narrow rift : it shot ,</l>
     <l n="89">Slew the huge gloom with golden shaft ,</l>

     <l n="7">The crowned Shadow poising dart</l>
     <l n="8">Hung over her : she , my own ,</l>

     <l n="12">At the shedding of leaves . And around</l>
     <l n="13">The sky was in garlands of cloud ,</l>
     <l n="14">Winning scents from unnumbered new births ,</l>
     <l n="15">Pointed buds , where the woods were browned</l>
     <l n="16">By a mouldered beechen shroud ;</l>
     <l n="17">Or over our meads of the vale ,</l>

     <l n="9">How wrought they in their zenith ? ‘ Tis not writ ;</l>
     <l n="10">Not all ; yet she by one sure sign can read :</l>

     <l n="10">Life glistens on the river of the death .</l>
     <l n="11">It folds us , flesh and dust ; and have we knelt ,</l>
     <l n="12">Or never knelt , or eyed as kine the springs</l>
     <l n="13">Of radiance , the radiance enrings :</l>
     <l n="14">And this is the soul 's haven to have felt .</l>
