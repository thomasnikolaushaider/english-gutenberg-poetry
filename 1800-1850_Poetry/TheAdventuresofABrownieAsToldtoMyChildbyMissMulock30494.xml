   <lg type="poem">
    <head>BROWNIE AND THE COOK</head>
     <l n="1">THERE was once a little Brownie , who lived — where do you think he lived ?</l>
     <l n="2">in a coal-cellar .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Now a coal-cellar may seem a most curious place to choose to live in ; but then a Brownie is a curious creature — a fairy , and yet not one of that sort of fairies who fly about on gossamer wings , and dance in the moonlight , and so on . He never dances ; and as to wings , what use would they be to him in a coal-cellar ? He is a sober , stay-at-home , household elf — nothing much to look at , even if you did see him , which you are not likely to do — only a little old man , about a foot high , all dressed in brown , with a brown face and hands , and a brown peaked cap , just the color of a brown mouse . And , like a mouse , he hides in corners — especially kitchen corners , and only comes out after dark when nobody is about , and so sometimes people call him Mr. Nobody .</p>
   <p>I said you were not likely to see him . I never did , certainly , and never knew any body that did ; but still , if you were to go into Devonshire , you would hear many funny stories about Brownies in general , and so I may as well tell you the adventures of this particular Brownie , who belonged to a family there ; which family he had followed from house to house , most faithfully , for years and years .</p>
   <p>A good many people had heard him — or supposed they had — when there were extraordinary noises about the house ; noises which must have come from a mouse or a rat — or a Brownie . But nobody had ever seen him except the children — the three little boys and three little girls — who declared he often came to play with them when they were alone , and was the nicest companion in the world , though he was such an old man — hundreds of years old ! He was full of fun and mischief , and up to all sorts of tricks , but he never did any body any harm unless they deserved it .</p>
   <p>Brownie was supposed to live under one particular coal , in the darkest corner of the cellar , which was never allowed to be disturbed . Why he had chosen it nobody knew , and how he lived there , nobody knew either , nor what he lived upon . Except that , ever since the family could remember , there had always been a bowl of milk put behind the coal-cellar door for the Brownie 's supper . Perhaps he drank it — perhaps he did n't : anyhow , the bowl was always found empty next morning . The old Cook , who had lived all her life in the family , had never forgotten to give Brownie his supper ; but at last she died , and a young cook came in her stead , who was very apt to forget every thing . She was also both careless and lazy , and disliked taking the trouble to put a bowl of milk in the same place every night for Mr. Nobody . “ She did n't believe in Brownies , ” she said ; “ she had never seen one , and seeing 's believing . ” So she laughed at the other servants , who looked very grave , and put the bowl of milk in its place as often as they could , without saying much about it .</p>
   <p>But once , when Brownie woke up , at his usual hour for rising — ten o'clock at night , and looked round in search of his supper — which was , in fact , his breakfast — he found nothing there . At first he could not imagine such neglect , and went smelling and smelling about for his bowl of milk — it was not always placed in the same corner now — but in vain .</p>
   <p>“ This will never do , ” said he ; and being extremely hungry , began running about the coal-cellar to see what he could find . His eyes were as useful in the dark as in the light — like a pussy-cat 's ; but there was nothing to be seen — not even a potato paring , or a dry crust , or a well-gnawed bone , such as Tiny the terrier sometimes brought into the coal-cellar and left on the floor — nothing , in short , but heaps of coals and coal-dust ; and even a Brownie cannot eat that , you know .</p>
   <p>“ Ca n't stand this ; quite impossible ! ” said the Brownie , tightening his belt to make his poor little inside feel less empty . He had been asleep so long — about a week , I believe , as was his habit when there was nothing to do — that he seemed ready to eat his own head , or his boots , or any thing . ‘ What 's to be done ? Since nobody brings my supper , I must go and fetch it . ’</p>
   <p>He spoke quickly , for he always thought quickly , and made up his mind in a minute . To be sure it was a very little mind , like his little body ; but he did the best he could with it , and was not a bad sort of old fellow , after all . In the house he had never done any harm , and often some good , for he frightened away all the rats , mice , and black-beetles . Not the crickets — he liked them , as the old Cook had done : she said they were such cheerful creatures , and always brought luck to the house . But the young Cook could not bear them , and used to pour boiling water down their holes , and set basins of beer for them with little wooden bridges up to the brim , that they might walk up , tumble in , and be drowned .</p>
   <p>So there was not even a cricket singing in the silent house when Brownie put his head out of his coal-cellar door , which , to his surprise , he found open . Old Cook used to lock it every night , but the young Cook had left that key , and the kitchen and pantry keys too , all dangling in the lock , so that any thief might have got in , and wandered all over the house without being found out .</p>
   <p>“ Hurrah , here 's luck ! ” cried Brownie , tossing his cap up in the air , and bounding right through the scullery into the kitchen . It was quite empty , but there was a good fire burning itself out — just for its own amusement , and the remains of a capital supper spread on the table — enough for half a dozen people being left still .</p>
   <p>Would you like to know what there was ? Devonshire cream , of course ; and part of a large dish of junket , which is something like curds and whey . Lots of bread-and-butter and cheese , and half an apple-pudding . Also a great jug of cider and another of milk , and several half-full glasses , and no end of dirty plates , knives , and forks . All were scattered about the table in the most untidy fashion , just as the servants had risen from their supper , without thinking to put any thing away .</p>
   <p>Brownie screwed up his little old face and turned up his button of a nose , and gave a long whistle . You might not believe it , seeing he lived in a coal-cellar ; but really he liked tidiness , and always played his pranks upon disorderly or slovenly folk .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>He wanted his supper , and oh ! what a supper he did eat !— Page 11</p>
   </figure>
   <p>“ Whew ! ” said he ; “ here 's a chance . What a supper I 'll get now ! ”</p>
   <p>And he jumped on to a chair and thence to the table , but so quietly that the large black cat with four white paws , called Muff , because she was so fat and soft and her fur so long , who sat dozing in front of the fire , just opened one eye and went to sleep again . She had tried to get her nose into the milk-jug , but it was too small ; and the junket-dish was too deep for her to reach , except with one paw . She did n't care much for bread and cheese and apple-pudding , and was very well fed besides ; so , after just wandering round the table , she had jumped down from it again , and settled herself to sleep on the hearth .</p>
   <p>But Brownie had no notion of going to sleep . He wanted his supper , and oh ! what a supper he did eat ! first one thing and then another , and then trying every thing all over again . And oh ! what a lot he drank — first milk and then cider , and then mixed the two together in a way that would have disagreed with any body except a Brownie . As it was , he was obliged to slacken his belt several times , and at last took it off altogether . But he must have had a most extraordinary capacity for eating and drinking — since , after he had nearly cleared the table , he was just as lively as if he had had no supper at all .</p>
   <p>Now his jumping was a little awkward , for there happened to be a clean white tablecloth : as this was only Monday , it had had no time to get dirty — untidy as the Cook was . And you know Brownie lived in a coal-cellar , and his feet were black with running about in coal dust . So wherever he trod , he left the impression behind , until at last the whole tablecloth was covered with black marks .</p>
   <p>Not that he minded this ; in fact , he took great pains to make the cloth as dirty as possible ; and then laughing loudly , “ Ho , ho , ho ! ” leaped on to the hearth , and began teasing the cat ; squeaking like a mouse , or chirping like a cricket , or buzzing like a fly ; and altogether disturbing poor Pussy 's mind so much , that she went and hid herself in the farthest corner , and left him the hearth all to himself , where he lay at ease till daybreak .</p>
   <p>Then , hearing a slight noise overhead , which might be the servants getting up , he jumped on to the table again — gobbled up the few remaining crumbs for his breakfast , and scampered off to his coal-cellar ; where he hid himself under his big coal , and fell asleep for the day .</p>
   <p>Well , the Cook came downstairs rather earlier than usual , for she remembered she had to clear off the remains of supper ; but lo and behold , there was nothing left to clear . Every bit of food was eaten up — the cheese looked as if a dozen mice had been nibbling at it , and nibbled it down to the very rind ; the milk and cider were all drunk — and mice do n't care for milk and cider , you know . As for the apple-pudding , it had vanished altogether ; and the dish was licked as clean as if Boxer , the yard-dog , had been at it in his hungriest mood .</p>
   <p>“ And my white table-cloth — oh , my clean white table-cloth ! What can have been done to it ? ” cried she , in amazement . For it was all over little black footmarks , just the size of a baby 's foot — only babies do n't wear shoes with nails in them , and do n't run about and climb on kitchen tables after all the family have gone to bed .</p>
   <p>Cook was a little frightened ; but her fright changed to anger when she saw the large black cat stretched comfortably on the hearth . Poor Muff had crept there for a little snooze after Brownie went away .</p>
   <p>“ You nasty cat ! I see it all now ; it 's you that have eaten up all the supper ; it 's you that have been on my clean table-cloth with your dirty paws . ”</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Cook beat poor Pussy till the creature ran mewing away</p>
   </figure>
   <p>They were white paws , and as clean as possible ; but the Cook never thought of that , any more than she did of the fact that cats do n't usually drink cider or eat apple-pudding .</p>
   <p>“ I 'll teach you to come stealing food in this way ; take that — and that — and that ! ”</p>
   <p>Cook got hold of a broom and beat poor Pussy till the creature ran mewing away . She could n't speak , you know — unfortunate cat ! and tell people that it was Brownie who had done it all .</p>
   <p>Next night Cook thought she would make all safe and sure ; so , instead of letting the cat sleep by the fire , she shut her up in the chilly coal-cellar , locked the door , put the key in her pocket , and went off to bed — leaving the supper as before .</p>
   <p>When Brownie woke up and looked out of his hole , there was , as usual , no supper for him , and the cellar was close shut . He peered about , to try and find some cranny under the door to creep out at , but there was none . And he felt so hungry that he could almost have eaten the cat , who kept walking to and fro in a melancholy manner — only she was alive , and he could n't well eat her alive : besides , he knew she was old , and had an idea she might be tough ; so he merely said , politely , “ How do you do , Mrs. Pussy ? ” to which she answered nothing — of course .</p>
   <p>Something must be done , and luckily Brownies can do things which nobody else can do . So he thought he would change himself into a mouse , and gnaw a hole through the door . But then he suddenly remembered the cat , who , though he had decided not to eat her , might take this opportunity of eating him . So he thought it advisable to wait till she was fast asleep , which did not happen for a good while . At length , quite tired with walking about , Pussy turned round on her tail six times , curled down in a corner , and fell fast asleep .</p>
   <p>Immediately Brownie changed himself into the smallest mouse possible ; and , taking care not to make the least noise , gnawed a hole in the door , and squeezed himself through , immediately turning into his proper shape again , for fear of accidents .</p>
   <p>The kitchen fire was at its last glimmer ; but it showed a better supper than even last night , for the Cook had had friends with her — a brother and two cousins — and they had been exceedingly merry . The food they had left behind was enough for three Brownies at least , but this one managed to eat it all up . Only once , in trying to cut a great slice of beef , he let the carving-knife and fork fall with such a clatter , that Tiny the terrier , who was tied up at the foot of the stairs , began to bark furiously . However , he brought her her puppy , which had been left in a basket in a corner of the kitchen , and so succeeded in quieting her .</p>
   <p>After that he enjoyed himself amazingly , and made more marks than ever on the white table-cloth ; for he began jumping about like a pea on a trencher , in order to make his particularly large supper agree with him .</p>
   <p>Then , in the absence of the cat , he teased the puppy for an hour or two , till hearing the clock strike five , he thought it as well to turn into a mouse again , and creep back cautiously into his cellar . He was only just in time , for Muff opened one eye , and was just going to pounce upon him , when he changed himself back into a Brownie . She was so startled that she bounded away , her tail growing into twice its natural size , and her eyes gleaming like round green globes . But Brownie only said , “ Ha , ha , ho ! ” and walked deliberately into his hole .</p>
   <p>When Cook came downstairs and saw that the same thing had happened again — that the supper was all eaten , and the table-cloth blacker than ever with the extraordinary footmarks , she was greatly puzzled . Who could have done it all ? Not the cat , who came mewing out of the coal-cellar the minute she unlocked the door . Possibly a rat — but then would a rat have come within reach of Tiny ?</p>
   <p>“ It must have been Tiny herself , or her puppy , ” which just came rolling out of its basket over Cook 's feet . “ You little wretch ! You and your mother are the greatest nuisance imaginable . I 'll punish you ! ”</p>
   <p>And , quite forgetting that Tiny had been safely tied up all night , and that her poor little puppy was so fat and helpless it could scarcely stand on its legs , to say nothing of jumping on chairs and tables , she gave them both such a thrashing that they ran howling together out of the kitchen door , where the kind little kitchen-maid took them up in her arms .</p>
   <p>“ You ought to have beaten the Brownie , if you could catch him , ” said she , in a whisper . “ He will do it again and again , you 'll see , for he can n't bear an untidy kitchen . You 'd better do as poor old Cook did , and clear the supper things away , and put the odds and ends safe in the larder ; also , ” she added , mysteriously , “ if I were you , I 'd put a bowl of milk behind the coal-cellar door . ”</p>
   <p>“ Nonsense ! ” answered the young Cook , and flounced away . But afterward she thought better of it , and did as she was advised , grumbling all the time , but doing it .</p>
   <p>Next morning the milk was gone ! Perhaps Brownie had drunk it up , anyhow nobody could say that he had n't . As for the supper , Cook having safely laid it on the shelves of the larder , nobody touched it . And the table-cloth , which was wrapped up tidily and put in the dresser drawer , came out as clean as ever , with not a single black footmark upon it . No mischief being done , the cat and the dog both escaped beating , and Brownie played no more tricks with any body — till the next time .</p>

   <p>ADVENTURE THE SECOND</p>
   <p>BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE</p>
   <p>THE “ next time ” was quick in coming , which was not wonderful , considering there was a Brownie in the house . Otherwise the house was like most other houses , and the family like most other families . The children also : they were sometimes good , sometimes naughty , like other children ; but , on the whole , they deserved to have the pleasure of a Brownie to play with them , as they declared he did — many and many a time .</p>
   <p>A favorite play-place was the orchard , where grew the biggest cherry-tree you ever saw . They called it their “ castle , ” because it rose up ten feet from the ground in one thick stem , and then branched out into a circle of boughs , with a flat place in the middle , where two or three children could sit at once . There they often did sit , turn by turn , or one at a time — sometimes with a book , reading ; and the biggest boy made a sort of rope-ladder by which they could climb up and down — which they did all winter , and enjoyed their “ castle ” very much .</p>
   <p>But one day in spring they found their ladder cut away ! The Gardener had done it , saying it injured the tree , which was just coming into blossom . Now this Gardener was a rather gruff man , with a growling voice . He did not mean to be unkind , but he disliked children ; he said they bothered him . But when they complained to their mother about the ladder , she agreed with Gardener that the tree must not be injured , as it bore the biggest cherries in all the neighborhood — so big that the old saying of “ taking two bites at a cherry , ” came really true .</p>
   <p>“ Wait till the cherries are ripe , ” said she ; and so the little people waited , and watched it through its leafing and blossoming — such sheets of blossom , white as snow !— till the fruit began to show , and grew large and red on every bough .</p>
   <p>At last one morning the mother said , “ Children , should you like to help gather the cherries to-day ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Hurrah ! ” they cried , “ and not a day too soon ; for we saw a flock of starlings in the next field — and if we do n't clear the tree , they will . ”</p>
   <p>“ Very well ; clear it , then . Only mind and fill my basket quite full , for preserving . What is over you may eat , if you like . ”</p>
   <p>“ Thank you , thank you ! ” and the children were eager to be off ; but the mother stopped them till she could get the Gardener and his ladder .</p>
   <p>“ For it is he must climb the tree , not you ; and you must do exactly as he tells you ; and he will stop with you all the time and see that you do n't come to harm . ”</p>
   <p>This was no slight cloud on the children 's happiness , and they begged hard to go alone .</p>
   <p>“ Please , might we ? We will be so good ! ”</p>
   <figure>
    <p>When the Gardener was steadying his ladder against the trunk of the cherry-tree</p>
   </figure>
   <p>The mother shook her head . All the goodness in the world would not help them if they tumbled off the tree , or ate themselves sick with cherries . “ You would not be safe , and I should be so unhappy ! ”</p>
   <p>To make mother “ unhappy ” was the worst rebuke possible to these children ; so they choked down their disappointment , and followed the Gardener as he walked on ahead , carrying his ladder on his shoulder . He looked very cross , and as if he did not like the children 's company at all .</p>
   <p>They were pretty good , on the whole , though they chattered a good deal ; but Gardener said not a word to them all the way to the orchard . When they reached it , he just told them to “ keep out of his way and not worrit him , ” which they politely promised , saying among themselves that they should not enjoy their cherry-gathering at all . But children who make the best of things , and try to be as good as they can , sometimes have fun unawares .</p>
   <p>When the Gardener was steadying his ladder against the trunk of the cherry-tree , there was suddenly heard the barking of a dog , and a very fierce dog , too . First it seemed close beside them , then in the flower-garden , then in the fowl-yard .</p>
   <p>Gardener dropped the ladder out of his hands . “ It 's that Boxer ! He has got loose again ! He will be running after my chickens , and dragging his broken chain all over my borders . And he is so fierce , and so delighted to get free . He 'll bite any body who ties him up , except me . ”</p>
   <p>“ Had n't you better you go and see after him ? ”</p>
   <p>Gardener thought it was the eldest boy who spoke , and turned round angrily ; but the little fellow had never opened his lips .</p>
   <p>Here there was heard a still louder bark , and from a quite different part of the garden .</p>
   <p>“ There he is — I 'm sure of it ! jumping over my bedding-out plants , and breaking my cucumber frames . Abominable beast !— just let me catch him ! ” Off Gardener darted in a violent passion , throwing the ladder down upon the grass , and forgetting all about the cherries and the children .</p>
   <p>The instant he was gone , a shrill laugh , loud and merry , was heard close by , and a little brown old man 's face peeped from behind the cherry-tree .</p>
   <p>“ How d'ye do ?— Boxer was me . Did n't I bark well ? Now I 'm come to play with you . ”</p>
   <p>The children clapped their hands ; for they knew they were going to have some fun if Brownie was there — he was the best little playfellow in the world . And then they had him all to themselves . Nobody ever saw him except the children .</p>
   <p>“ Come on ! ” cried he , in his shrill voice , half like an old man 's , half like a baby 's . “ Who 'll begin to gather the cherries ? ”</p>
   <figure>
    <p>A little brown old man 's face peeped from behind the cherry-tree .— Page 20</p>
   </figure>
   <p>They all looked blank ; for the tree was so high to where the branches sprang , and besides , their mother had said they were not to climb . And the ladder lay flat upon the grass — far too heavy for little hands to move .</p>
   <p>“ What ! you big boys do n't expect a poor little fellow like me to lift the ladder all by myself ? Try ! I 'll help you . ”</p>
   <p>Whether he helped or not , no sooner had they taken hold of the ladder than it rose up , almost of its own accord , and fixed itself quite safely against the tree .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ But we must not climb — mother told us not , ” said the boys , ruefully .</l>
     <l n="2">“ Mother said we were to stand at the bottom and pick up the cherries . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ Very well . Obey your mother . I 'll just run up the tree myself . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">Before the words were out of his mouth Brownie darted up the ladder like</l>
     <l n="5">a monkey , and disappeared among the fruit-laden branches .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="6">The children looked dismayed for a minute , till they saw a merry brown</l>
     <l n="7">face peeping out from the green leaves at the very top of the tree .</l>
    </lg>

   <p>“ Biggest fruit always grows highest , ” cried the Brownie . “ Stand in a row , all you children . Little boys , hold out your caps : little girls , make a bag of your pinafores . Open your mouths and shut your eyes , and see what the queen will send you . ”</p>
   <p>They laughed and did as they were told ; whereupon they were drowned in a shower of cherries — cherries falling like hailstones , hitting them on their heads , their cheeks , their noses — filling their caps and pinafores , and then rolling and tumbling on to the grass , till it was strewn thick as leaves in autumn with the rosy fruit .</p>
   <p>What a glorious scramble they had — these three little boys and three little girls ! How they laughed and jumped and knocked their heads together in picking up the cherries , yet never quarreled — for there were such heaps , it would have been ridiculous to squabble over them ; and besides , whenever they began to quarrel , Brownie always ran away . Now he was the merriest of the lot ; ran up and down the tree like a cat , helped to pick up the cherries , and was first-rate at filling the large market-basket .</p>
   <p>“ We were to eat as many as we liked , only we must first fill the basket , ” conscientiously said the eldest girl ; upon which they all set to at once , and filled it to the brim .</p>
   <p>“ Now we 'll have a dinner-party , ” cried the Brownie ; and squatted down like a Turk , crossed his queer little legs , and sticking his elbows upon his knees , in a way that nobody but a Brownie could manage . “ Sit in a ring ! sit in a ring ! and we 'll see who can eat fastest . ”</p>
   <p>The children obeyed . How many cherries they devoured , and how fast they did it , passes my capacity of telling . I only hope they were not ill next day , and that all the cherry-stones they swallowed by mistake did not disagree with them . But perhaps nothing does disagree with one when one dines with a Brownie . They ate so much , laughing in equal proportion , that they had quite forgotten the Gardener — when , all of a sudden , they heard him clicking angrily the orchard gate , and talking to himself as he walked through .</p>
   <p>“ That nasty dog ! It was n't Boxer , after all . A nice joke ! to find him quietly asleep in his kennel after having hunted him , as I thought , from one end of the garden to the other ! Now for the cherries and the children — bless us , where are the children ? And the cherries ? Why , the tree is as bare as a blackthorn in February ! The starlings have been at it , after all . Oh dear ! oh dear ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Oh dear ! oh dear ! ” echoed a voice from behind the tree , followed by shouts of mocking laughter . Not from the children — they sat as demure as possible , all in a ring , with their hands before them , and in the centre the huge basket of cherries , piled as full as it could possibly hold . But the Brownie had disappeared .</p>
   <p>“ You naughty brats , I 'll have you punished ! ” cried the Gardener , furious at the laughter , for he never laughed himself . But as there was nothing wrong ; the cherries being gathered — a very large crop — and the ladder found safe in its place — it was difficult to say what had been the harm done and who had done it .</p>
   <p>So he went growling back to the house , carrying the cherries to the mistress , who coaxed him into good temper again , as she sometimes did ; bidding also the children to behave well to him , since he was an old man , and not really bad — only cross . As for the little folks , she had not the slightest intention of punishing them ; and , as for Brownie , it was impossible to catch him . So nobody was punished at all .</p>

    <head>ADVENTURE THE THIRD</head>
    <head>BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD</head>
    <head>WHICH was a place where he did not often go , for he preferred being warm and snug in the house . But when he felt himself ill-used , he would wander anywhere , in order to play tricks upon those whom he thought had done him harm ; for , being only a Brownie , and not a man , he did not understand that the best way to revenge yourself upon your enemies is either to let them alone or to pay them back good for evil — it disappoints them so much , and makes them so exceedingly ashamed of themselves .</head>
     <l n="1">One day Brownie overheard the Gardener advising the Cook to put sour</l>
     <l n="2">milk into his bowl at night , instead of sweet .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ He 'd never find out the difference , no more than the pigs do . Indeed , it 's my belief that a pig , or dog , or something , empties the bowl , and not a Brownie , at all . It 's just clean waste — that 's what I say . ”</p>
   <p>“ Then you 'd better hold your tongue , and mind your own business , ” returned the Cook , who was of a sharp temper , and would not stand being meddled with . She began to abuse the Gardener soundly ; but his wife , who was standing by , took his part , as she always did when any third party scolded him . So they all squabbled together , till Brownie , hid under his coal , put his little hands over his little ears .</p>
   <p>“ Dear me , what a noise these mortals do make when they quarrel ! They quite deafen me . I must teach them better manners . ”</p>
   <p>But when the Cook slammed the door to , and left Gardener and his wife alone , they too began to dispute between themselves .</p>
   <p>“ You make such a fuss over your nasty pigs , and get all the scraps for them , ” said the wife . “ It 's of much more importance that I should have everything Cook can spare for my chickens . Never were such fine chickens as my last brood ! ”</p>
   <p>“ I thought they were ducklings . ”</p>
   <p>“ How you catch me up , you rude old man ! They are ducklings , and beauties , too — even though they have never seen water . Where 's the pond you promised to make for me , I wonder ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Rubbish , woman ! If my cows do without a pond , your ducklings may . And why will you be so silly as to rear ducklings at all ? Fine fat chickens are a deal better . You 'll find out your mistake some day . ”</p>
   <p>“ And so will you when that old Alderney runs dry . You 'll wish you had taken my advice , and fattened and sold her . ”</p>
   <p>“ Alderney cows wo n't sell for fattening , and women 's advice is never worth twopence . Yours is n't worth even a half-penny . What are you laughing at ? ”</p>
   <p>“ I was n't laughing , ” said the wife , angrily ; and , in truth , it was not she , but little Brownie , running under the barrow which the Gardener was wheeling along , and very much amused that people should be so silly as to squabble about nothing .</p>
   <p>It was still early morning ; for , whatever this old couple 's faults might be , laziness was not one of them . The wife rose with the dawn to feed her poultry and collect her eggs ; the husband also got through as much work by breakfast-time as many an idle man does by noon . But Brownie had been beforehand with them this day .</p>
   <p>When all the fowls came running to be fed , the big Brahma hen who had watched the ducklings was seen wandering forlornly about , and clucking mournfully for her young brood — she could not find them anywhere . Had she been able to speak , she might have told how a large white Aylesbury duck had waddled into the farmyard , and waddled out again , coaxing them after her , no doubt in search of a pond . But missing they were , most certainly .</p>
   <p>“ Cluck , cluck , cluck ! ” mourned the miserable hen-mother — and , “ Oh , my ducklings , my ducklings ! ” cried the Gardener 's wife — “ Who can have carried off my beautiful ducklings ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Rats , maybe , ” said the Gardener , cruelly , as he walked away . And as he went he heard the squeak of a rat below his wheelbarrow . But he could not catch it , any more than his wife could catch the Aylesbury duck . Of course not . Both were — the Brownie !</p>
   <p>Just at this moment the six little people came running into the farmyard . When they had been particularly good , they were sometimes allowed to go with Gardener a-milking , each carrying his or her own mug for a drink of milk , warm from the cow . They scampered after him — a noisy tribe , begging to be taken down to the field , and holding out their six mugs entreatingly .</p>
   <p>“ What ! six cupfuls of milk , when I have n't a drop to spare , and Cook is always wanting more ? Ridiculous nonsense ! Get along with you ; you may come to the field — I can n't hinder that — but you 'll get no milk to-day . Take your mugs back again to the kitchen . ”</p>
   <figure>
    <p>A noisy tribe , holding out their six mugs entreatingly .</p>
   </figure>
   <p>The poor little folks made the best of a bad business , and obeyed ; then followed Gardener down to the field , rather dolefully . But it was such a beautiful morning that they soon recovered their spirits . The grass shone with dew , like a sheet of diamonds , the clover smelled so sweet , and two skylarks were singing at one another high up in the sky . Several rabbits darted past , to their great amusement , especially one very large rabbit — brown , not gray — which dodged them in and out , and once nearly threw Gardener down , pail and all , by running across his feet ; which set them all laughing , till they came where Dolly , the cow , lay chewing the cud under a large oak-tree .</p>
   <p>It was great fun to stir her up , as usual , and lie down , one after the other , in the place where she had lain all night long , making the grass flat , and warm , and perfumy with her sweet breath . She let them do it , and then stood meekly by ; for Dolly was the gentlest cow in the world .</p>
   <p>But this morning something strange seemed to possess her . She altogether refused to be milked — kicked , plunged , tossed over the pail , which was luckily empty .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Bless the cow ! what 's wrong with her ? It 's surely you children 's fault .</l>
     <l n="2">Stand off , the whole lot of you . Soh , Dolly ! good Dolly ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">But Dolly was any thing but good . She stood switching her tail , and</l>
     <l n="4">looking as savage as so mild an animal possibly could look .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">“ It 's all your doing , you naughty children ! You have been playing her</l>
     <l n="6">some trick , I know , ” cried the Gardener , in great wrath .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>They assured him they had done nothing , and indeed , they looked as quiet as mice and as innocent as lambs . At length the biggest boy pointed out a large wasp which had settled in Dolly 's ear .</p>
   <p>“ That accounts for everything , ” said the Gardener .</p>
   <p>But it did not mend everything ; for when he tried to drive it away it kept coming back and back again , and buzzing round his own head and the cow 's with a voice that the children thought was less like a buzz of a wasp than the sound of a person laughing . At length it frightened Dolly to such an extent that , with one wild bound she darted right away , and galloped off to the farther end of the field .</p>
   <p>“ I 'll get a rope and tie her legs together , ” cried the Gardener , fiercely . “ She shall repent giving me all this trouble — that she shall ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Ha , ha , ha ! ” laughed somebody . The Gardener thought it was the children , and gave one of them an angry cuff as he walked away . But they knew it was somebody else , and were not at all surprised when , the minute his back was turned , Dolly came walking quietly back , led by a little wee brown man who scarcely reached up to her knees . Yet she let him guide her , which he did as gently as possible , though the string he held her by was no thicker than a spider web , floating from one of her horns .</p>
   <p>“ Soh , Dolly ! good Dolly ! ” cried Brownie , mimicking the Gardener 's voice . “ Now we 'll see what we can do . I want my breakfast badly — do n't you , little folks ? ”</p>
   <p>Of course they did , for the morning air made them very hungry .</p>
   <p>“ Very well — wait a bit , though . Old people should be served first , you know . Besides , I want to go to bed . ”</p>
   <p>“ Go to bed in the daylight ! ” The children all laughed , and then looked quite shy and sorry , lest they might have seemed rude to the little Brownie . But he — he liked fun ; and never took offence when none was meant .</p>
   <p>He placed himself on the milking-stool , which was so high that his little legs were dangling half-way down , and milked and milked — Dolly standing as still as possible — till he had filled the whole pail . Most astonishing cow ! she gave as much as two cows ; and such delicious milk as it was — all frothing and yellow — richer than even Dolly 's milk had ever been before . The children 's mouths watered for it , but not a word said they — even when , instead of giving it to them , Brownie put his own mouth to the pail , and drank and drank , till it seemed as if he were never going to stop . But it was decidedly a relief to them when he popped his head up again , and lo ! the pail was as full as ever !</p>
   <p>“ Now , little ones , now 's your turn . Where are your mugs ? ”</p>
   <p>All answered mournfully , “ We 've got none . Gardener made us take them back again . ”</p>
   <p>“ Never mind — all right . Gather me half a dozen of the biggest buttercups you can find . ”</p>
   <p>“ What nonsense ! ” thought the children ; but they did it . Brownie laid the flowers in a row upon the eldest girl 's lap — blew upon them one by one , and each turned into the most beautiful golden cup that ever was seen !</p>
   <p>“ Now , then , every one take his own mug , and I 'll fill it . ”</p>
   <p>He milked away — each child got a drink , and then the cups were filled again . And all the while Dolly stood as quiet as possible — looking benignly round , as if she would be happy to supply milk to the whole parish , if the Brownie desired it .</p>
   <p>“ Soh , Dolly ! Thank you , Dolly ! ” said he , again , mimicking the Gardener 's voice , half growling , half coaxing . And while he spoke , the real voice was heard behind the hedge . There was a sound as of a great wasp flying away , which made Dolly prick up her ears , and look as if the old savageness was coming back upon her . The children snatched up their mugs , but there was no need , they had all turned into buttercups again .</p>
   <p>Gardener jumped over the stile , as cross as two sticks , with an old rope in his hand .</p>
   <p>“ Oh , what a bother I 've had ! Breakfast ready , and no milk yet — and such a row as they are making over those lost ducklings . Stand back , you children , and do n't hinder me a minute . No use begging — not a drop of milk shall you get . Hillo , Dolly ? Quiet old girl ! ”</p>
   <p>Quiet enough she was this time — but you might as well have milked a plaster cow in a London milking-shop . Not one ringing drop resounded against the empty pail ; for , when they peeped in , the children saw , to their amazement , that it was empty .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Each child got a drink , and then the cups were filled again .— Page 32</p>
   </figure>
   <p>“ The creature 's bewitched ! ” cried the Gardener , in a great fury . “ Or else somebody has milked her dry already . Have you done it ? or you ? ” he asked each of the children .</p>
   <p>They might have said No — which was the literal truth — but then it would not have been the whole truth , for they knew quite well that Dolly had been milked , and also who had done it . And their mother had always taught them that to make a person believe a lie is nearly as bad as telling him one . Yet still they did not like to betray the kind little Brownie . Greatly puzzled , they hung their heads and said nothing .</p>
   <p>“ Look in your pail again , ” cried a voice from the other side of Dolly . And there at the bottom was just the usual quantity of milk — no more and no less .</p>
   <p>The Gardener was very much astonished . “ It must be the Brownie ! ” muttered he , in a frightened tone ; and , taking off his hat , “ Thank you , sir , ” said he to Mr. Nobody — at which the children all burst out laughing . But they kept their own counsel , and he was afraid to ask them any more questions .</p>
   <p>By-and-by his fright wore off a little . “ I only hope the milk is good milk , and will poison nobody , ” said he , sulkily . “ However , that 's not my affair . You children had better tell your mother all about it . I left her in the farmyard in a pretty state of mind about her ducklings . ”</p>
   <p>Perhaps Brownie heard this , and was sorry , for he liked the children 's mother , who had always been kind to him . Besides , he never did any body harm who did not deserve it ; and though , being a Brownie , he could hardly be said to have a conscience , he had something which stood in the place of one — a liking to see people happy rather than miserable .</p>
   <p>So , instead of going to bed under his big coal for the day , when , after breakfast , the children and their mother came out to look at a new brood of chickens , he crept after them and hid behind the hencoop where the old mother-hen was put , with her young ones round her .</p>
   <p>There had been great difficulty in getting her in there , for she was a hen who hatched her brood on independent principles . Instead of sitting upon the nice nest that the Gardener made for her , she had twice gone into a little wood close by and made a nest for herself , which nobody could ever find ; and where she hatched in secret , coming every second day to be fed , and then vanishing again , till at last she re-appeared in triumph , with her chickens running after her . The first brood there had been twelve , but of this there were fourteen — all from her own eggs , of course , and she was uncommonly proud of them . So was the Gardener , so was the mistress — who liked all young things . Such a picture as they were ! fourteen soft , yellow , fluffy things , running about after their mother . It had been a most troublesome business to catch — first her , and then them , to put them under the coop . The old hen resisted , and pecked furiously at Gardener 's legs , and the chickens ran about in frantic terror , chirping wildly in answer to her clucking .</p>
   <p>At last , however , the little family was safe in shelter , and the chickens counted over , to see that none had been lost in the scuffle . How funny they were ! looking so innocent and yet so wise , as chickens do — peering out at the world from under their mother 's wing , or hopping over her back , or snuggled all together under her breast , so that nothing was seen of them but a mass of yellow legs , like a great centiped .</p>
   <p>“ How happy the old hen is , ” said the children 's mother , looking on , and then looking compassionately at that other forlorn old hen , who had hatched the ducklings , and kept wandering about the farmyard , clucking miserably , “ Those poor ducklings , what can have become of them ? If rats had killed them , we should have found feathers or something ; and weasels would have sucked their brains and left them . They must have been stolen , or wandered away , and died of cold and hunger — my poor ducklings ! ”</p>
   <p>The mistress sighed , for she could not bear any living thing to suffer . And the children nearly cried at the thought of what might be happening to their pretty ducklings . That very minute a little wee brown face peered through a hole in the hencoop , making the old mother-hen fly furiously at it — as she did at the slightest shadow of an enemy to her little ones . However , no harm happened — only a guinea-fowl suddenly ran across the farmyard , screaming in its usual harsh voice . But it was not the usual sort of guinea-fowl , being larger and handsomer than any of theirs .</p>
   <p>“ Oh , what a beauty of a creature ! how did it ever come into our farmyard , ” cried the delighted children ; and started off after it , to catch it if possible .</p>
   <p>But they ran , and they ran — through the gate and out into the lane ; and the guinea-fowl still ran on before them , until , turning round a corner , they lost sight of it , and immediately saw something else , equally curious . Sitting on the top of a big thistle — so big that he must have had to climb it just like a tree — was the Brownie . His legs were crossed , and his arms too , his little brown cap was stuck knowingly on one side , and he was laughing heartily .</p>
   <p>“ How do you do ? Here I am again . I thought I would n't go to bed after all . Shall I help you to find the ducklings ? Very well ! come along . ”</p>
   <p>They crossed the field , Brownie running beside them , and as fast as they could , though he looked such an old man ; and sometimes turning over on legs and arms like a Catherine wheel — which they tried to imitate , but generally failed , and only bruised their fingers and noses .</p>
   <p>He lured them on and on till they came to the wood , and to a green path in it , which well as they knew the neighborhood , none of the children had ever seen before . It led to a most beautiful pond , as clear as crystal and as blue as the sky . Large trees grew round it , dipping their branches in the water , as if they were looking at themselves in a glass . And all about their roots were quantities of primroses — the biggest primroses the little girls had ever seen . Down they dropped on their fat knees , squashing more primroses than they gathered , though they tried to gather them all ; and the smallest child even began to cry because her hands were so full that the flowers dropped through her fingers . But the boys , older and more practical , rather despised primroses .</p>
   <p>“ I thought we had come to look for ducklings , ” said the eldest . “ Mother is fretting dreadfully about her ducklings . Where can they be ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Shut your eyes , and you 'll see , ” said the Brownie , at which they all laughed , but did it ; and when they opened their eyes again , what should they behold but a whole fleet of ducklings sailing out from the roots of an old willow-tree , one after the other , looking as fat and content as possible , and swimming as naturally as if they had lived on a pond — and this particularly pond , all their days .</p>
   <p>“ Count them , ” said the Brownie , “ the whole eight — quite correct . And then try and catch them — if you can . ”</p>
   <p>Easier said than done . The boys set to work with great satisfaction — boys do so enjoy hunting something . They coaxed them — they shouted at them — they threw little sticks at them ; but as soon as they wanted them to go one way the fleet of ducklings immediately turned round and sailed another way , doing it so deliberately and majestically , that the children could not help laughing . As for little Brownie , he sat on a branch of the willow-tree , with his legs dangling down to the surface of the pond , kicking at the water-spiders , and grinning with all his might . At length , quite tired out , in spite of their fun , the children begged for his help , and he took compassion on them .</p>
   <p>“ Turn round three times and see what you can find , ” shouted he .</p>
   <p>Immediately each little boy found in his arms , and each little girl in her pinafore , a fine fat duckling . And there being eight of them , the two elder children had each a couple . They were rather cold and damp , and slightly uncomfortable to cuddle , ducks not being used to cuddling . Poor things ! they struggled hard to get away . But the children hugged them tight , and ran as fast as their legs could carry them through the wood , forgetting , in their joy , even to say “ Thank you ” to the little Brownie .</p>
   <p>When they reached their mother she was as glad as they , for she never thought to see her ducklings again ; and to have them back alive and uninjured , and watch them running to the old hen , who received them with an ecstasy of delight , was so exciting , that nobody thought of asking a single question as to where they had been found .</p>
   <p>When the mother did ask , the children told her about Brownie 's taking them to the beautiful pond — and what a wonderful pond it was ; how green the trees were round it ; and how large the primroses grew . They never tired of talking about it and seeking for it . But the odd thing was that , seek as they might , they never could find it again . Many a day did the little people roam about one by one , or all together , round the wood , often getting themselves sadly draggled with mud and torn with brambles — but the beautiful pond they never found again .</p>
   <p>Nor did the ducklings , I suppose ; for they wandered no more from the farmyard , to the old mother-hen 's great content . They grew up into fat and respectable ducks — five white ones and three gray ones — waddling about , very content , though they never saw water , except the tank which was placed for them to paddle in . They lived a lazy , peaceful , pleasant life for a long time , and were at last killed and eaten with green peas , one after the other , to the family 's great satisfaction , if not to their own .</p>

    <head>ADVENTURE THE FOURTH</head>
    <head>BROWNIE 'S RIDE</head>
     <l n="1">FOR the little Brownie , though not given to horsemanship , did once take</l>
     <l n="2">a ride , and a very remarkable one it was . Shall I tell you all about it ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The six little children got a present of something they had longed for all their lives — a pony . Not a rocking-horse , but a real live pony — a Shetland pony , too , which had traveled all the way from the Shetland Isles to Devonshire — where every body wondered at it , for such a creature had not been seen in the neighborhood for years and years . She was no bigger than a donkey , and her coat , instead of being smooth like a horse 's , was shaggy like a young bear 's . She had a long tail , which had never been cut , and such a deal of hair in her mane and over her eyes that it gave her quite a fierce countenance . In fact , among the mild and tame Devonshire beasts , the little Shetland pony looked almost like a wild animal . But in reality she was the gentlest creature in the world . Before she had been many days with them , she began to know the children quite well ; followed them about , ate corn out of the bowl they held out to her ; nay , one day , when the eldest little girl offered her bread-and-butter , she stooped her head and took it from the child 's hand , just like a young lady . Indeed , Jess — that was her name — was altogether so lady-like in her behavior , that more than once Cook allowed her to walk in at the back-door , when she stood politely warming her nose at the kitchen-fire for a minute or two , then turned round and as politely walked out again . But she never did any mischief ; and was so quiet and gentle a creature that she bade fair soon to become as great a pet in the household as the dog , the cat , the kittens , the puppies , the fowls , the ducks , the cow , the pig , and all the other members of the family .</p>
   <p>The only one who disliked her , and grumbled at her , was the Gardener . This was odd ; because , though cross to children , the old man was kind to dumb beasts . Even his pig knew his voice and grunted , and held out his nose to be scratched ; and he always gave each successive pig a name , Jack or Dick , and called them by it , and was quite affectionate to them , one after the other , until the very day that they were killed . But they were English pigs — and the pony was Scotch — and the Devonshire Gardener hated every thing Scotch , he said ; besides , he was not used to groom 's work , and the pony required such a deal of grooming on account of her long hair . More than once Gardener threatened to clip it short , and turn her into a regular English pony , but the children were in such distress and mother forbade any such spoiling of Jessie 's personal appearance .</p>
   <p>At length , to keep things smooth , and to avoid the rough words and even blows which poor Jess sometimes got , they sought in the village for a boy to look after her , and found a great rough , shock-headed lad named Bill , who , for a few shillings a week , consented to come up every morning and learn the beginning of a groom 's business ; hoping to end , as his mother said he should , in sitting , like the squire 's fat coachman , as broad as he was long , on the top of the hammer-cloth of a grand carriage , and do nothing all day but drive a pair of horses as stout as himself a few miles along the road and back again .</p>
   <p>Bill would have liked this very much , he thought , if he could have been a coachman all at once , for if there was one thing he disliked , it was work . He much preferred to lie in the sun all day and do nothing ; and he only agreed to come and take care of Jess because she was such a very little pony , that looking after her seemed next door to doing nothing . But when he tried it , he found his mistake . True , Jess was a very gentle beast , so quiet that the old mother-hen with fourteen chicks used , instead of roosting with the rest of the fowls , to come regularly into the portion of the cow-shed which was partitioned off for a stable , and settle under a corner of Jess 's manger for the night ; and in the morning the chicks would be seen running about fearlessly among her feet and under her very nose .</p>
   <p>But , for all that , she required a little management , for she did not like her long hair to be roughly handled ; it took a long time to clean her ; and , though she did not scream out like some silly little children when her hair was combed , I am afraid she sometimes kicked and bounced about , giving Bill a deal of trouble — all the more trouble , the more impatient Bill was .</p>
   <p>And then he had to keep within call , for the children wanted their pony at all hours . She was their own especial property , and they insisted upon learning to ride — even before they got a saddle . Hard work it was to stick on Jess 's bare back , but by degrees the boys did it , turn and turn about , and even gave their sisters a turn too — a very little one — just once round the field and back again , which was quite enough , they considered , for girls . But they were very kind to their little sisters , held them on so that they could not fall , and led Jess carefully and quietly : and altogether behaved as elder brothers should .</p>
   <p>Nor did they squabble very much among themselves , though sometimes it was rather difficult to keep their turns all fair , and remember accurately which was which . But they did their best , being , on the whole , extremely good children . And they were so happy to have their pony , that they would have been ashamed to quarrel over her .</p>
   <p>Also , one very curious thing kept them on their good behavior . Whenever they did begin to misconduct themselves — to want to ride out of their turns , or to domineer over one another , or the boys , joining together , tried to domineer over the girls , as I grieve to say boys not seldom do — they used to hear in the air , right over their heads , the crack of an unseen whip . It was none of theirs , for they had not got a whip ; that was a felicity which their father had promised when they could all ride like a young gentleman and ladies ; but there was no mistaking the sound — indeed , it always startled Jess so that she set off galloping , and could not be caught again for many minutes .</p>
   <p>This happened several times , until one of them said , “ Perhaps it 's the Brownie . ” Whether it was or not , it made them behave better for a good while ; till one unfortunate day the two eldest began contending which should ride foremost and which hindmost on Jess 's back , when “ Crick — crack ! ” went the whip in the air , frightening the pony so much that she kicked up her heels , tossed both the boys over her head , and scampered off , followed by a loud “ Ha , ha , ha ! ”</p>
   <p>It certainly did not come from the two boys , who had fallen — quite safely , but rather unpleasantly — into a large nettle-bed ; whence they crawled out , rubbing their arms and legs , and looking too much ashamed to complain . But they were rather frightened and a little cross , for Jess took a skittish fit , and refused to be caught and mounted again , till the bell rang for school — when she grew as meek as possible . Too late — for the children were obliged to run indoors , and got no more rides for the whole day .</p>
   <p>Jess was from this incident supposed to be on the same friendly terms with Brownie as were the rest of the household . Indeed , when she came , the children had taken care to lead her up to the coal-cellar door and introduce her properly — for they knew Brownie was very jealous of strangers , and often played them tricks . But after that piece of civility he would be sure , they thought , to take her under his protection . And sometimes , when the little Shetlander was restless and pricked up her ears , looking preternaturally wise under those shaggy brows of hers , the children used to say to one another , “ Perhaps she sees the Brownie . ”</p>
   <p>Whether she did or not , Jess sometimes seemed to see a good deal that others did not see , and was apparently a favorite with the Brownie , for she grew and thrived so much that she soon became the pride and delight of the children and of the whole family . You would hardly have known her for the rough , shaggy , half-starved little beast that had arrived a few weeks before . Her coat was so silky , her limbs so graceful , and her head so full of intelligence , that every body admired her . Then even Gardener began to admire her too .</p>
   <p>“ I think I 'll get upon her back ; it will save me walking down to the village , ” said he , one day . And she actually carried him — though , as his feet nearly touched the ground , it looked as if the man were carrying the pony , and not the pony the man . And the children laughed so immoderately , that he never tried it afterward .</p>
   <p>Nor Bill neither , though he had once thought he should like a ride , and got astride on Jess ; but she quickly ducked her head down , and he tumbled over it . Evidently she had her own tastes as to her riders , and much preferred little people to big ones .</p>
   <p>Pretty Jess ! when cantering round the paddock with the young folk she really was quite a picture . And when at last she got a saddle — a new , beautiful saddle , with a pommel to take off and on , so as to suit both boys and girls — how proud they all were , Jess included ! That day they were allowed to take her into the market-town — Gardener leading her , as Bill could not be trusted — and every body , even the blacksmith , who hoped by-and-by to have the pleasure of shoeing her , said , what a beautiful pony she was !</p>
   <p>After this , Gardener treated Jess a great deal better , and showed Bill how to groom her , and kept him close at it too , which Bill did not like at all . He was a very lazy lad , and whenever he could shirk work he did it ; and many a time when the children wanted Jess , either there was nobody to saddle her , or she had not been properly groomed , or Bill was away at his dinner , and they had to wait till he came back and could put her in order to be taken out for a ride like a genteel animal — which I am afraid neither pony nor children enjoyed half so much as the old ways before Bill came .</p>
   <p>Still , they were gradually becoming excellent little horsemen and horsewomen — even the youngest , only four years old , whom all the rest were very tender over , and who was often held on Jess 's back and given a ride out of her turn because she was a good little girl , and never cried for it . And seldomer and seldomer was heard the mysterious sound of the whip in the air , which warned them of quarreling — Brownie hated quarreling .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Jess quickly ducked her head down and Bill tumbled over it .</p>
   </figure>
   <p>In fact , their only trouble was Bill , who never came to his work in time , and never did things when wanted , and was ill-natured , lazy , and cross to the children , so that they disliked him very much .</p>
   <p>“ I wish the Brownie would punish you , ” said one of the boys ; “ you 'd behave better then . ”</p>
   <p>“ The Brownie ! ” cried Bill , contemptuously ; “ if I caught him , I 'd kick him up in the air like this ! ”</p>
   <p>And he kicked up his cap — his only cap , it was — which , strange to relate , flew right up , ever so high , and lodged at the very top of a tree which overhung the stable , where it dangled for weeks and weeks , during which time poor Bill had to go bareheaded .</p>
   <p>He was very much vexed , and revenged himself by vexing the children in all sorts of ways . They would have told their mother , and asked her to send Bill away , only she had a great many anxieties just then , for their old grandmother was very ill , and they did not like to make a fuss about any thing that would trouble her .</p>
   <p>So Bill staid on , and nobody found out what a bad , ill-natured , lazy boy he was .</p>
   <p>But one day the mother was sent for suddenly , not knowing when she should be able to come home again . She was very sad , and so were the children , for they loved their grandmother — and as the carriage drove off they all stood crying round the front-door for ever so long .</p>
   <p>The servants even cried too — all but Bill .</p>
   <p>“ It 's an ill wind that blows nobody good , ” said he . “ What a jolly time I shall have ! I 'll do nothing all day long . Those troublesome children sha'n ' t have Jess to ride ; I 'll keep her in the stable , and then she wo n't get dirty , and I shall have no trouble in cleaning her . Hurrah ! what fun ! ”</p>
   <p>He put his hands in his pockets , and sat whistling the best part of the afternoon .</p>
   <p>The children had been so unhappy , that for that day they quite forgot Jess ; but next morning , after lessons were over , they came begging for a ride .</p>
   <p>“ You can n't get one . The stable-door 's locked and I 've lost the key . ” ( He had it in his pocket all the time . )</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ How is poor Jess to get her dinner ? ” cried a thoughtful little girl .</l>
     <l n="2">“ Oh , how hungry she will be ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">And the child was quite in distress , as were the two other girls . But</l>
     <l n="4">the boys were more angry than sorry .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">“ It was very stupid of you , Bill , to lose the key . Look about and find</l>
     <l n="6">it , or else break open the door . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ I wo n't , ” said Bill ; “ I dare say the key will turn up before night , and if it does n't , who cares ? You get riding enough and too much . I 'll not bother myself about it , or Jess either . ”</p>
   <p>And Bill sauntered away . He was a big fellow , and the little lads were rather afraid of him . But as he walked , he could not keep his hand out of his trowsers-pocket , where the key felt growing heavier and heavier , till he expected it every minute to tumble through and come out at his boots — convicting him before all the children of having told a lie .</p>
   <p>Nobody was in the habit of telling lies to them , so they never suspected him , but went innocently searching about for the key — Bill all the while clutching it fast . But every time he touched it , he felt his fingers pinched , as if there was a cockroach in his pocket — or little lobster — or something , anyhow , that had claws . At last , fairly frightened , he made an excuse to go into the cow-shed , took the key out of his pocket and looked at it , and finally hid it in a corner of the manger , among the hay .</p>
   <p>As he did so , he heard a most extraordinary laugh , which was certainly not from Dolly the cow , and , as he went out of the shed , he felt the same sort of pinch at his ankles , which made him so angry that he kept striking with his whip in all directions , but hit nobody for nobody was there .</p>
   <p>But Jess — who , as soon as she heard the children 's voices , set up a most melancholy whinnying behind the locked stable-door — began to neigh energetically . And Boxer barked , and the hens cackled , and the guinea-fowls cried “ Come back , come back ! ” in their usual insane fashion — indeed , the whole farmyard seemed in such an excited state , that the children got frightened lest Gardener should scold them , and ran away , leaving Bill master of the field .</p>
   <p>What an idle day he had ! How he sat on the wall with his hands in his pockets , and lounged upon the fence , and sauntered around the garden ! At length , absolutely tired of doing nothing , he went and talked with the Gardener 's wife while she was hanging out her clothes . Gardener had gone down to the lower field , with all the little folks after him , so that he knew nothing of Bill 's idling , or it might have come to an end .</p>
   <p>By-and-by Bill thought it was time to go home to his supper . “ But first I 'll give Jess her corn , ” said he , “ double quantity , and then I need not come back to give her her breakfast so early in the morning . Soh ! you greedy beast ! I 'll be at you presently , if you do n't stop that noise . ”</p>
   <p>For Jess , at sound of his footsteps , was heard to whinny in the most imploring manner , enough to have melted a heart of stone .</p>
   <p>“ The key — where on earth did I put the key ? ” cried Bill , whose constant habit it was to lay things out of his hand and then forget where he had put them , causing himself endless loss of time in searching for them — as now . At last he suddenly remembered the corner of the cow 's manger , where he felt sure he had left it . But the key was not there .</p>
   <p>“ You can n't have eaten it , you silly old cow , ” said he , striking Dolly on the nose as she rubbed herself against him — she was an affectionate beast . “ Nor you , you stupid old hen ! ” kicking the mother of the brood , who , with her fourteen chicks , being shut out of their usual roosting-place — Jess 's stable — kept pecking about under Dolly 's legs . “ It can n't have gone without hands — of course it can n't . ” But most certainly the key was gone .</p>
   <p>What in the world should Bill do ? Jess kept on making a pitiful complaining . No wonder , as she had not tasted food since morning . It would have made any kind-hearted person quite sad to hear her , thinking how exceedingly hungry the poor pony must be .</p>
   <p>Little did Bill care for that , or for anything , except that he should be sure to get into trouble as soon as he was found out . When he heard Gardener coming into the farmyard , with the children after him , Bill bolted over the wall like a flash of lightning , and ran away home , leaving poor Jess to her fate .</p>
   <p>All the way he seemed to hear at his heels a little dog yelping , and then a swarm of gnats buzzing round his head , and altogether was so perplexed and bewildered , that when he got into his mother 's cottage he escaped into bed , and pulled the blanket over his ears to shut out the noise of the dog and the gnats , which at last turned into a sound like somebody laughing . It was not his mother , she did n't often laugh , poor soul !— Bill bothered her quite too much for that , and he knew it . Dreadfully frightened , he hid his head under the bedclothes , determined to go to sleep and think about nothing till next day .</p>
   <p>Meantime Gardener returned , with all the little people trooping after him . He had been rather kinder to them than usual this day , because he knew their mother had gone away in trouble , and now he let them help him to roll the gravel , and fetch up Dolly to be milked , and watch him milk her in the cow-shed — where , it being nearly winter , she always spent the night now . They were so well amused that they forgot all about their disappointment as to the ride , and Jess did not remind them of it by her whinnying . For as soon as Bill was gone she grew silent .</p>
   <p>At last one little girl , the one who had cried over Jess 's being left hungry , remembered the poor pony , and , peeping through a crevice in the cow-shed , saw her stand contentedly munching at a large bowlful of corn .</p>
   <p>“ So Bill did find the key . I 'm very glad , ” thought the kind little maiden , and to make sure looked again , when — what do you think she beheld squatting on the manger ? Something brown — either a large brown rat , or a small brown man . But she held her tongue , since , being a very little girl , people sometimes laughed at her for the strange things she saw . She was quite certain she did see them , for all that .</p>
   <p>So she and the rest of the children went indoors and to bed . When they were fast asleep , something happened . Something so curious , that the youngest boy , who , thinking he heard Jess neighing , got up to look out , was afraid to tell , lest he too should be laughed at , and went back to bed immediately .</p>
   <p>In the middle of the night , a little old brown man carrying a lantern , or at least having a light in his hand that looked like a lantern — went and unlocked Jess 's stable , and patted her pretty head . At first she started , but soon she grew quiet and pleased , and let him do what he chose with her . He began rubbing her down , making the same funny hissing with his mouth that Bill did , and all grooms do — I never could find out why . But Jess evidently liked it , and stood as good as possible .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Up the bank she scrambled , her long hair dripping .— Page 55</p>
   </figure>
   <p>“ Is n't it nice to be clean ? ” said the wee man , talking to her as if she were a human being , or a Brownie . “ And I dare say your poor little legs ache with standing so long . Shall we have a run together ? the moon shines bright in the clear , cold night . Dear me ! I 'm talking poetry . ”</p>
   <p>But Brownies are not poetical fairies , quite commonplace , and up to all sorts of work . So , while he talked , he was saddling and bridling Jess , she not objecting in the least . Finally , he jumped on her back .</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Off , said the stranger — off , off , and away ! ’ ” sang Brownie mimicking a song of the Cook 's . People in that house often heard their songs repeated in the oddest way , from room to room , everybody fancying it was somebody else that did it . But it was only the Brownie . “ Now , ‘ A southerly wind and a cloudy sky proclaim a hunting morning ! ’ ”</p>
   <p>Or night — for it was the middle of the night , though bright as day — and Jess galloped and the Brownie sat on her back as merrily as if they had gone hunting together all their days .</p>
   <p>Such a steeple-chase it was ! They cleared the farmyard at a single bound , and went flying down the road , and across the ploughed field , and into the wood . Then out into the open country , and by-and-by into a dark , muddy lane — and oh ! how muddy Devonshire lanes can be sometimes !</p>
   <p>“ Let 's go into the water to wash ourselves , ” said Brownie , and coaxed Jess into a deep stream , which she swam as bravely as possible — she had not had such a frolic since she left her native Shetland Isles . Up the bank she scrambled , her long hair dripping as if she had been a water-dog instead of a pony . Brownie , too , shook himself like a rat or a beaver , throwing a shower round him in all directions .</p>
   <p>“ Never mind ; at it again , my lass ! ” and he urged Jess into the water once more . Out she came , wetter and brisker than ever , and went back home again through the lane , and the wood , and the ploughed field , galloping like the wind , and tossing back her ears and mane and tail , perfectly frantic with enjoyment .</p>
   <p>But when she reached her stable , the plight she was in would have driven any respectable groom frantic too . Her sides were white with foam , and the mud was sticking all over her like a plaster . As for her beautiful long hair , it was all caked together in a tangle , as if all the combs in the world would never make it smooth again . Her mane especially was plaited into knots , which people in Devonshire call elf-locks , and say , when they find them on their horses , that it is because the fairies have been riding them .</p>
   <p>Certainly , poor Jess had been pretty well ridden that night . When just as the dawn began to break , Gardener got up and looked into the farmyard , his sharp eye caught sight of the stable-door wide open .</p>
   <p>“ Well done , Bill , ” shouted he , “ up early at last . One hour before breakfast is worth three after . ”</p>
   <p>But no Bill was there ; only Jess , trembling and shaking , all in a foam , and muddy from head to foot , but looking perfectly cheerful in her mind . And out from under her fore legs ran a small creature which Gardener mistook for Tiny , only Tiny was gray , and this dog was brown , of course !</p>
   <p>I should not like to tell you all that was said to Bill when , an hour after breakfast-time , he came skulking up to the farm . In fact , words failing , Gardener took a good stick and laid it about Bill 's shoulders , saying he would either do this , or tell the mistress of him , and how he had left the stable-door open all night , and some bad fellow had stolen Jess , and galloped her all across the country , till , if she had n't been the cleverest pony in the world , she never could have got back again .</p>
   <p>Bill durst not contradict this explanation of the story , especially as the key was found hanging up in its proper place by the kitchen door . And when he went to fetch it , he heard the most extraordinary sound in the coal-cellar close by — like somebody snoring or laughing . Bill took to his heels , and did not come back for a whole hour .</p>
   <p>But when he did come back , he made himself as busy as possible . He cleaned Jess , which was half a day 's work at least . Then he took the little people a ride , and afterward put his stable in the most beautiful order , and altogether was such a changed Bill , that Gardener told him he must have left himself at home and brought back somebody else : whether or not , the boy certainly improved , so that there was less occasion to find fault with him afterward .</p>
   <p>Jess lived to be quite an old pony , and carried a great many people — little people always , for she herself never grew any bigger . But I do n't think she ever carried a Brownie again .</p>

   <p>ADVENTURE THE FIFTH</p>
   <p>BROWNIE ON THE ICE</p>
   <p>WINTER was a grand time with the six little children especially when they had frost and snow . This happened seldom enough for it to be the greatest possible treat when it did happen ; and it never lasted very long , for the winters are warm in Devonshire .</p>
   <p>There was a little lake three fields off , which made the most splendid sliding-place imaginable . No skaters went near it — it was not large enough ; and besides , there was nobody to skate , the neighborhood being lonely . The lake itself looked the loneliest place imaginable . It was not very deep — not deep enough to drown a man — but it had a gravelly bottom , and was always very clear . Also , the trees round it grew so thick that they sheltered it completely from the wind , so , when it did freeze , it generally froze as smooth as a sheet of glass .</p>
   <p>“ The lake bears ! ” was such a grand event , and so rare , that when it did occur , the news came at once to the farm , and the children carried it as quickly to their mother . For she had promised them that , if such a thing did happen this year — it did not happen every year — lessons should be stopped entirely , and they should all go down to the lake and slide , if they liked , all day long .</p>
   <p>So one morning , just before Christmas , the eldest boy ran in with a countenance of great delight .</p>
   <p>“ Mother , mother , the lake bears ! ” ( It was rather a compliment to call it a lake , it being only about twenty yards across and forty long . ) “ The lake really bears ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Who says so ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Bill . Bill has been on it for an hour this morning , and has made us two such beautiful slides , he says — an upslide and a down-slide . May we go directly ? ”</p>
   <p>The mother hesitated .</p>
   <p>“ You promised , you know , ” pleaded the children .</p>
   <p>“ Very well , then ; only be careful . ”</p>
   <p>“ And may we slide all day long , and never come home for dinner or any thing ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Yes , if you like . Only Gardener must go with you , and stay all day . ”</p>
   <p>This they did not like at all ; nor , when Gardener was spoken to , did he .</p>
   <p>“ You bothering children ! I wish you may all get a good ducking in the lake ! Serve you right for making me lose a day 's work , just to look after you little monkeys . I 've a great mind to tell your mother I wo n't do it . ”</p>
   <p>But he did not , being fond of his mistress . He was also fond of his work , but he had no notion of play . I think the saying of , “ All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy , ” must have been applied to him , for Gardener , whatever he had been as a boy , was certainly a dull and melancholy man . The children used to say that if he and idle Bill could have been kneaded into one , and baked in the oven — a very warm oven — they would have come out rather a pleasant person .</p>
   <p>As it was , Gardener was any thing but a pleasant person ; above all , to spend a long day with , and on the ice , where one needs all one 's cheerfulness and good-humor to bear pinched fingers and numbed toes , and trips and tumbles , and various uncomfortablenesses .</p>
   <p>“ He 'll growl at us all day long — he 'll be a regular spoil-sport ! ” lamented the children . “ Oh ! mother , might n't we go alone ? ”</p>
   <p>“ No ! ” said the mother ; and her “ No ” meant no , though she was always very kind . They argued the point no more , but started off , rather downhearted . But soon they regained their spirits , for it was a bright , clear , frosty day — the sun shining , though not enough to melt the ice , and just sufficient to lie like a thin sprinkling over the grass , and turn the brown branches into white ones . The little people danced along to keep themselves warm , carrying between them a basket which held their lunch . A very harmless lunch it was — just a large brown loaf and a lump of cheese , and a knife to cut it with . Tossing the basket about in their fun , they managed to tumble the knife out , and were having a search for it in the long grass , when Gardener came up , grumpily enough .</p>
   <p>“ To think of trusting you children with one of the table-knives and a basket ! what a fool Cook must be ! I 'll tell her so ; and if they 're lost she 'll blame me : give me the things . ”</p>
   <p>He put the knife angrily in one pocket . “ Perhaps it will cut a hole in it , ” said one of the children , in rather a pleased tone than otherwise ; then he turned the lunch all out on the grass and crammed it in the other pocket , hiding the basket behind a hedge .</p>
   <p>“ I 'm sure I 'll not be at the trouble of carrying it , ” said he , when the children cried out at this ; “ and you sha n't carry it either , for you 'll knock it about and spoil it . And as for your lunch getting warm in my pocket , why , so much the better this cold day . ”</p>
   <p>It was not a lively joke , and they knew the pocket was very dirty ; indeed , the little girls had seen him stuff a dead rat into it only the day before . They looked ready to cry ; but there was no help for them , except going back and complaining to their mother , and they did not like to do that . Besides , they knew that , though Gardener was cross , he was trustworthy , and she would never let them go down to the lake without him .</p>
   <p>So they followed him , trying to be as good as they could — though it was difficult work . One of them proposed pelting him with snowballs , as they pelted each other . But at the first — which fell in his neck — he turned round so furiously , that they never sent a second , but walked behind him as meek as mice .</p>
   <p>As they went , they heard little steps pattering after them .</p>
   <p>“ Perhaps it is the Brownie to play with us — I wish he would , ” whispered the youngest girl to the eldest boy , whose hand she generally held ; and then the little pattering steps sounded again , traveling through the snow , but they saw nobody — so they said nothing .</p>
   <p>The children would have liked to go straight to the ice ; but Gardener insisted on taking them a mile round , to look at an extraordinary animal which a farmer there had just got — sent by his brother in Australia . The two old men stood gossiping so long that the children wearied extremely . Every minute seemed an hour till they got on the ice .</p>
   <p>At last one of them pulled Gardener 's coat-tails , and whispered that they were quite ready to go .</p>
   <p>“ Then I 'm not , ” and he waited ever so much longer , and got a drink of hot cider , which made him quite lively for a little while .</p>
   <p>But by the time they reached the lake , he was as cross as ever . He struck the ice with his stick , but made no attempt to see if it really did bear — though he would not allow the children to go one step upon it till he had tried .</p>
   <p>“ I know it does n't bear , and you 'll just have to go home again — a good thing too — saves me from losing a day 's work . ”</p>
   <p>“ Try , only try ; Bill said it bore , ” implored the boys , and looked wistfully at the two beautiful slides — just as Bill said , one up and one down — stretching all across the lake ; “ of course it bears , or Bill could not have made these slides . ”</p>
   <p>“ Bill 's an ass ! ” said the Gardener , and put his heavy foot cautiously on the ice . Just then there was seen jumping across it a creature which certainly had never been seen on ice before . It made the most extraordinary bounds on its long hind legs , with its little fore legs tucked up in front of it as if it wanted to carry a muff ; and its long , stiff tail sticking out straight behind , to balance it itself with apparently . The children at first started with surprise , and then burst out laughing , for it was the funniest creature , and had the funniest way of getting along , that they had ever seen in their lives .</p>
   <p>“ It 's the kangaroo ! ” said Gardener , in great excitement . “ It has got loose — and it 's sure to be lost — and what a way Mr. Giles will be in ! I must go and tell him . Or stop , I 'll try and catch it . ”</p>
   <p>But in vain — it darted once or twice across the ice , dodging him , as it were ; and once coming so close that he nearly caught it by the tail — to the children 's great delight — then it vanished entirely .</p>
   <p>“ I must go and tell Mr. Giles directly , ” said Gardener , and then stopped . For he had promised not to leave the children ; and it was such a wild-goose chase , after an escaped kangaroo . But he might get half a crown as a reward , and he was sure of another glass of cider .</p>
   <p>“ You just stop quiet here , and I 'll be back in five minutes , ” said he to the children . “ You may go a little way on the ice — I think it 's sound enough ; only mind you do n't tumble in , for there 'll be nobody to pull you out . ”</p>
   <p>“ Oh no , ” said the children , clapping their hands . They did not care for tumbling in , and were quite glad there was nobody there to pull them out . They hoped Gardener would stop a very long time away — only , as some one suggested when he was seen hurrying across the snowy field , he had taken away their lunch in his pocket , too .</p>
   <p>Off they darted , the three elder boys , with a good run ; the biggest of the girls followed after them ; and soon the whole four were skimming one after the other , as fast as a railway train , across the slippery ice . And , like a railway train , they had a collision , and all came tumbling one over the other , with great screaming and laughing , to the high bank on the other side . The two younger ones stood mournfully watching the others from the opposite bank — when there stood beside them a small brown man .</p>
   <p>“ Ho-ho ! little people , ” said he , coming between them and taking hold of a hand of each . His was so warm and theirs so cold , that it was quite comfortable . And then , somehow , they found in their mouths a nice lozenge — I think it was peppermint , but am not sure ; which comforted them still more .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Did you want me to play with you ? ” cried the Brownie ; “ then here I am .</l>
     <l n="2">What shall we do ? Have a turn on the ice together ? ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>No sooner said than done . The two children felt themselves floating along — it was more like floating than running — with Brownie between them ; up the lake , and down the lake , and across the lake , not at all interfering with the sliders — indeed , it was a great deal better than sliding . Rosy and breathless , their toes so nice and warm , and their hands feeling like mince-pies just taken out of the oven — the little ones came to a standstill .</p>
   <p>The elder ones stopped their sliding , and looked toward Brownie with entreating eyes . He swung himself up to a willow bough , and then turned head over heels on to the ice .</p>
   <p>“ Halloo ! you do n't mean to say you big ones want a race too ! Well , come along — if the two eldest will give a slide to the little ones . ”</p>
   <p>He watched them take a tiny sister between them , and slide her up one slide and down another , screaming with delight . Then he took the two middle children in either hand .</p>
   <p>“ One , two , three , and away ! ” Off they started — scudding along as light as feathers and as fast as steam-engines , over the smooth , black ice , so clear that they could see the bits of stick and water-grasses frozen in it , and even the little fishes swimming far down below — if they had only looked long enough .</p>
   <p>When all had had their fair turns , they began to be frightfully hungry .</p>

   <p>“ Catch a fish for dinner , and I 'll lend you a hook , ” said Brownie . At which they all laughed , and then looked rather grave . Pulling a cold , raw live fish from under the ice and eating it was not a pleasant idea of dinner . “ Well , what would you like to have ? Let the little one choose . ”</p>
   <p>She said , after thinking a minute , that she should like a currant-cake .</p>
   <p>“ And I 'd give all you a bit of it — a very large bit — I would indeed ! ” added she , almost with the tears in her eyes — she was so very hungry .</p>
   <p>“ Do it , then ! ” said the Brownie , in his little squeaking voice .</p>
   <p>Immediately the stone that the little girl was sitting on — a round , hard stone , and so cold !— turned into a nice hot cake — so hot that she jumped up directly . As soon as she saw what it was , she clapped her hands for joy .</p>
   <p>“ Oh , what a beautiful , beautiful cake ! only we have n't got a knife to cut it . ”</p>
   <p>The boys felt in all their pockets , but somehow their knives never were there when they were wanted .</p>
   <p>“ Look ! you 've got one in your hand ! ” said Brownie to the little one ; and that minute a bit of stick she held turned into a bread-knife — silver , with an ivory handle — big enough and sharp enough , without being too sharp . For the youngest girl was not allowed to use sharp knives , though she liked cutting things excessively , especially cakes .</p>
   <p>“ That will do . Sit you down and carve the dinner . Fair shares and do n't let any body eat too much . Now begin , ma'am , ” said the Brownie , quite politely , as if she had been ever so old .</p>
   <p>Oh , how proud the little girl was . How bravely she set to work , and cut five of the biggest slices you ever saw , and gave them to her brothers and sisters , and was just going to take the sixth slice for herself , when she remembered the Brownie .</p>
   <p>“ I beg your pardon , ” said she , as politely as he , though she was such a very little girl , and turned round to the wee brown man . But he was nowhere to be seen . The slices of cake in the children 's hands remained cake , and uncommonly good it was , and such substantial eating that it did nearly the same as dinner ; but the cake itself turned suddenly to a stone again , and the knife into a bit of stick .</p>
   <p>For there was the Gardener coming clumping along by the bank of the lake , and growling as he went .</p>
   <p>“ Have you got the kangaroo ? ” shouted the children , determined to be civil , if possible .</p>
   <p>“ This place is bewitched , I think , ” said he , “ The kangaroo was fast asleep in the cow-shed . What ! how dare you laugh at me ? ”</p>
   <p>But they had n't laughed at all . And they found it no laughing matter , poor children , when Gardener came on the ice , and began to scold them and order them about . He was perfectly savage with crossness ; for the people at Giles 's Farm had laughed at him very much , and he did not like to be laughed at — and at the top of the field he had by chance met his mistress , and she asked him severely how he could think of leaving the children alone .</p>
   <p>Altogether , his conscience pricked him a good deal , and when people 's consciences prick them , sometimes they get angry with other people , which is very silly , and only makes matters worse .</p>
   <p>“ What have you been doing all this time ? ” said he .</p>
   <p>“ All this five minutes ? ” said the oldest boy , mischievously ; for Gardener was only to be away five minutes , and he had staid a full hour . Also , when he fumbled in his pocket for the children 's lunch — to stop their tongues , perhaps — he found it was not there .</p>
   <p>They set up a great outcry ; for , in spite of the cake , they could have eaten a little more . Indeed , the frost had such an effect upon all their appetites , that they felt not unlike that celebrated gentleman of whom it is told that</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ He ate a cow , and ate a calf ,</l>
     <l n="2">He ate an ox , and ate a half ;</l>
     <l n="3">He ate a church , he ate the steeple ,</l>
     <l n="4">He ate the priest , and all the people ,</l>
     <l n="5">And said he had n't had enough then . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">“ We 're so hungry , so very hungry ! Could n't you go back again and fetch</l>
     <l n="7">us some dinner ? ” cried they , entreatingly .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Not I , indeed . You may go back to dinner yourselves . You shall , indeed , for I want my dinner too . Two hours is plenty long enough to stop on the ice . ”</p>
   <p>“ It is n't two hours — it 's only one . ”</p>
   <p>“ Well , one will do better than more . You 're all right now — and you might soon tumble in , or break your legs on the slide . So come away home . ”</p>
   <p>It was n't kind of Gardener , and I do n't wonder the children felt it hard ; indeed , the eldest boy resisted stoutly .</p>
   <p>“ Mother said we might stop all day , and we will stop all day . You may go home if you like . ”</p>
   <p>“ I wo n't , and you shall ! ” said Gardener , smacking a whip that he carried in his hand . “ Stop till I catch you , and I 'll give you this about your back , my fine gentleman . ”</p>
   <p>And he tried to follow , but the little fellow darted across the ice , objecting to be either caught or whipped . It may have been rather naughty , but I am afraid it was great fun dodging the Gardener up and down ; he being too timid to go on the slippery ice , and sometimes getting so close that the whip nearly touched the lad .</p>
   <p>“ Bless us ! there 's the kangaroo again ! ” said he , starting . Just as he had caught the boy , and lifted the whip , the creature was seen hop-hopping from bank to bank . “ I can n't surely be mistaken this time ; I must catch it . ”</p>
   <p>Which seemed quite easy , for it limped as if it was lame , or as if the frost had bitten its toes , poor beast ! Gardener went after it , walking cautiously on the slippery , crackling ice , and never minding whether or not he walked on the slides , though they called out to him that his nailed boots would spoil them .</p>
   <p>But whether it was that ice which bears a boy will not bear a man , or whether at each lame step of the kangaroo there came a great crack , is more than I can tell . However , just as Gardener reached the middle of the lake , the ice suddenly broke , and in he popped .— The kangaroo too , apparently , for it was not seen afterward .</p>
   <p>What a hullaballoo the poor man made ! Not that he was drowning — the lake was too shallow to drown any body , but he got terribly wet , and the water was very cold . He soon scrambled out , the boys helping him ; and then he hobbled home as fast as he could , not even saying thank you , or taking the least notice of them .</p>
   <p>Indeed , nobody took notice of them — nobody came to fetch them , and they might have staid sliding the whole afternoon . Only somehow they did not feel quite easy in their minds . And though the hole in the ice closed up immediately , and it seemed as firm as ever , still they did not like to slide upon it again .</p>
   <p>“ I think we had better go home and tell mother every thing , ” said one of them . “ Besides , we ought to see what has become of poor Gardener . He was very wet . ”</p>
   <p>“ Yes , but oh , how funny he looked ! ” And they all burst out laughing at the recollection of the figure he cut , scrambling out through the ice with his trowsers dripping up to the knees , and the water running out of his boots , making a little pool , wherever he stepped .</p>
   <p>“ And it freezes so hard , that by the time he gets home his clothes will be as stiff as a board . His wife will have to put him to the fire to thaw before he can get out of them . ”</p>
   <figure>
    <p>The ice suddenly broke , and in he popped .</p>
   </figure>
   <p>Again the little people burst into shouts of laughter . Although they laughed , they were a little sorry for the poor old Gardener , and hoped no great harm had come to him , but that he had got safe home and been dried by his own warm fire .</p>
   <p>The frosty mist was beginning already to rise , and the sun , though still high up in the sky , looked like a ball of red-hot iron as the six children went homeward across the fields — merry enough still , but not quite so merry as they had been a few hours before .</p>
   <p>“ Let 's hope mother wo n't be vexed with us , ” said they , “ but will let us come back again to-morrow . It was n't our fault that Gardener tumbled in . ”</p>
   <p>As somebody said this , they all heard quite distinctly , “ Ha , ha , ha ! ” and “ Ho , ho , ho ! ” and a sound of little steps pattering behind .</p>
   <p>But whatever they thought , nobody ventured to say that it was the fault of the Brownie .</p>

   <p>ADVENTURE THE SIXTH AND LAST</p>
   <p>BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES</p>
   <p>TILL the next time ; but when there is a Brownie in the house , no one can say that any of his tricks will be the last . For there 's no stopping a Brownie , and no getting rid of him either . This one had followed the family from house to house , generation after generation — never any older , and sometimes seeming even to grow younger by the tricks he played . In fact , though he looked like an old man , he was a perpetual child .</p>
   <p>To the children he never did any harm , quite the contrary . And his chief misdoings were against those who vexed the children . But he gradually made friends with several of his grown up enemies . Cook , for instance , who had ceased to be lazy at night and late in the morning , found no more black footmarks on her white table cloth . And Brownie found his basin of milk waiting for him , night after night , behind the coal-cellar door .</p>
   <p>Bill , too , got on well enough with his pony , and Jess was taken no more night-rides . No ducks were lost ; and Dolly gave her milk quite comfortably to whoever milked her . Alas ! this was either Bill or the Gardener 's wife now . After that adventure on the ice , poor Gardener very seldom appeared ; when he did , it was on two crutches , for he had had rheumatism in his feet , and could not stir outside his cottage door . Bill , therefore , had double work ; which was probably all the better for Bill .</p>
   <p>The garden had to take care of itself ; but this being winter-time , it did not much signify . Besides , Brownie seldom went into the garden , except in summer ; during the hard weather he preferred to stop in his coal-cellar . It might not have been a lively place , but it was warm , and he liked it .</p>
   <p>He had company there , too ; for when the cat had more kittens — the kitten he used to tease being grown up now — they were all put in a hamper in the coal-cellar ; and of cold nights Brownie used to jump in beside them , and be as warm and as cozy as a kitten himself . The little things never were heard to mew ; so it may be supposed they liked his society . And the old mother-cat evidently bore him no malice for the whipping she had got by mistake ; so Brownie must have found means of coaxing her over . One thing you may be sure of — all the while she and her kittens were in his coal-cellar , he took care never to turn himself into a mouse .</p>
   <p>He was spending the winter , on the whole , very comfortably , without much trouble either to himself or his neighbors , when one day , the coal-cellar being nearly empty , two men , and a great wagon-load of coals behind them , came to the door , Gardener 's wife following .</p>
   <p>“ My man says you 're to give the cellar a good cleaning out before you put any more in , ” said she , in her sharp voice ; “ and do n't be lazy about it . It 'll not take you ten minutes , for it 's nearly all coal-dust , except that one big lump in the corner — you might clear that out too . ”</p>
   <p>“ Stop , it 's the Brownie 's lump ! better not meddle with it , ” whispered the little scullery-maid .</p>
   <p>“ Do n't you meddle with matters that can n't concern you , ” said the Gardener 's wife , who had been thinking what a nice help it would be to her fire . To be sure , it was not her lump of coal , but she thought she might take it ; the mistress would never miss it , or the Brownie either . He must be a very silly old Brownie to live under a lump of coal .</p>
   <p>So she argued with herself , and made the men lift it . “ You must lift it , you see , if you are to sweep the coal-cellar out clean . And you may as well put it on the barrow , and I 'll wheel it out of your way . ”</p>
   <p>This she said in quite a civil voice , lest they should tell of her , and stood by while it was being done . It was done without any thing happening , except that a large rat ran out of the coal-cellar door , bouncing against her feet , and frightening her so much that she nearly tumbled down .</p>
   <p>“ See what nonsense it is to talk of Brownies living in a coal-cellar . Nothing lives there but rats , and I 'll have them poisoned pretty soon , and get rid of them . ”</p>
   <p>But she was rather frightened all the same , for the rat had been such a very big rat , and had looked at her , as it darted past , with such wild , bright , mischievous eyes — brown eyes , of course — that she all but jumped with surprise .</p>
   <p>However , she had got her lump of coal , and was wheeling it quietly away , nobody seeing , to her cottage at the bottom of the garden . She was a hard-worked woman , and her husband 's illness made things harder for her . Still , she was not quite easy at taking what did not belong to her .</p>
   <p>“ I do n't suppose any body will miss the coal , ” she repeated . “ I dare say the mistress would have given it to me if I had asked her ; and as for its being the Brownie 's lump — fudge ! Bless us ! what 's that ? ”</p>
   <p>For the barrow began to creak dreadfully , and every creak sounded like the cry of a child , just as if the wheel were going over its leg and crushing its poor little bones .</p>
   <p>“ What a horrid noise ! I must grease the barrow . If only I knew where they keep the grease-box . All goes wrong , now my old man 's laid up . Oh , dear ! oh dear ! ”</p>
   <p>For suddenly the barrow had tilted over , though there was not a single stone near , and the big coal was tumbled on to the ground , where it broke into a thousand pieces . Gathering it up again was hopeless , and it made such a mess on the gravel-walk , that the old woman was thankful her misfortune happened behind the privet hedge , where nobody was likely to come .</p>
   <p>“ I 'll take a broom and sweep it up to-morrow . Nobody goes near the orchard now , except me when I hang out the clothes ; so I need say nothing about it to the old man or any body . But ah ! deary me , what a beautiful lot of coal I 've lost ! ”</p>
   <p>She stood and looked at it mournfully , and then went into her cottage , where she found two or three of the little children keeping Gardener company . They did not dislike to do this now ; but he was so much kinder than he used to be — so quiet and patient , though he suffered very much . And he had never once reproached them for what they always remembered — how it was ever since he was on the ice with them that he had got the rheumatism .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Suddenly the barrow had tilted over .</p>
   </figure>
   <p>So , one or other of them made a point of going to see him every day , and telling him all the funny things they could think of — indeed , it was a contest among them who should first make Gardener laugh . They did not succeed in doing that exactly ; but they managed to make him smile ; and he was always gentle and grateful to them ; so that they sometimes thought it was rather nice his being ill .</p>
   <p>But his wife was not pleasant ; she grumbled all day long , and snapped at him and his visitors ; being especially snappish this day , because she had lost her big coal .</p>
   <p>“ I can n't have you children come bothering here , ” said she , crossly . “ I want to wring out my clothes , and hang them to dry . Be off with you ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Let us stop a little — just to tell Gardener this one curious thing about Dolly and the pig — and then we 'll help you to take your clothes to the orchard ; we can carry your basket between us — we can , indeed . ”</p>
   <p>That was the last thing the woman wished ; for she knew the that the children would be sure to see the mess on the gravel-walk — and they were such inquisitive children — they noticed every thing . They would want to know all about it , and how the bits of coal came there . It was very a awkward position . But people who take other people 's property often do find themselves in awkward positions .</p>
   <p>“ Thank you , young gentlemen , ” said she , quite politely ; “ but indeed the basket is too heavy for you . However , you may stop and gossip a little longer with my old man . He likes it . ”</p>
   <p>And , while they were shut up with Gardener in his bedroom , off she went , carrying the basket on her head , and hung her clothes carefully out — the big things on lines between the fruit trees , and the little things , such as stockings and pocket handkerchiefs , stuck on the gooseberry-bushes , or spread upon the clean green grass .</p>
   <p>“ Such a fine day as it is ! they 'll dry directly , ” said she , cheerfully , to herself . “ Plenty of sun , and not a breath of wind to blow them about . I 'll leave them for an hour or two , and come and fetch them in before it grows dark . Then I shall get all my folding done by bedtime , and have a clear day for ironing to-morrow . ”</p>
   <p>But when she did fetch them in , having bundled them all together in the dusk of the evening , never was such a sight as those clothes ! They were all twisted in the oddest way — the stockings turned inside out , with the heels and toes tucked into the legs ; the sleeves of the shirts tied together in double knots , the pocket-handkerchiefs made into round balls , so tight that if you had pelted a person with them they would have given very hard blows indeed . And the whole looked as if , instead of lying quietly on the grass and bushes , they had been dragged through heaps of mud and then stamped upon , so that there was not a clean inch upon them from end to end .</p>
   <p>“ What a horrid mess ! ” cried the Gardener 's wife , who had been at first very angry , and then very frightened . “ But I know what it is ; that nasty Boxer has got loose again . It 's he that has done it . ”</p>
   <p>“ Boxer would n't tie shirt-sleeves in double knots , or make balls of pocket-handkerchiefs , ” Gardener was heard to answer , solemnly .</p>
   <p>“ Then it 's those horrid children ; they are always up to some mischief or other — just let me catch them ! ”</p>
   <p>“ You 'd better not , ” said somebody in a voice exactly like Gardener 's , though he himself declared he had not spoken a word . Indeed , he was fast asleep .</p>
   <p>“ Well , it 's the most extraordinary thing I ever heard of , ” the Gardener 's wife said , supposing she was talking to her husband all the time ; but soon she held her tongue , for she found here and there among the clothes all sorts of queer marks — marks of fingers , and toes , and heels , not in mud at all , but in coal-dust , as black as black could be .</p>
   <p>Now , as the place where the big coal had tumbled out of the barrow was fully fifty yards from the orchard , and , as the coal could not come to the clothes , and the clothes could not go without hands , the only conclusion she could arrive at was — well , no particular conclusion at all !</p>
   <p>It was too late that night to begin washing again ; besides , she was extremely tired , and her husband woke up rather worse than usual , so she just bundled the clothes up anyhow in a corner , put the kitchen to rights , and went mournfully to bed .</p>
   <p>Next morning she got up long before it was light , washed her clothes through all over again , and , it being impossible to dry them by the fire , went out with them once more , and began spreading them out in their usual corner , in a hopeless and melancholy manner . While she was at it , the little folks came trooping around her . She did n't scold them this time , she was too low-spirited .</p>
   <p>“ No ! my old man is n't any better , and I do n't fancy he ever will be , ” said she , in answer to their questions . “ And every thing 's going wrong with us — just listen ! ” And she told the trick which had been played her about the clothes .</p>
   <p>The little people tried not to laugh , but it was so funny ; and even now , the minute she had done hanging them out , there was something so droll in the way the clothes blew about , without any wind ; the shirts hanging with their necks downward , as if there was a man inside them ; and the drawers standing stiffly astride on the gooseberry-bushes , for all the world as if they held a pair of legs still . As for Gardener 's night-caps — long , white cotton , with a tassel at the top — they were alarming to look at ; just like a head stuck on the top of a pole .</p>
   <p>The whole thing was so peculiar , and the old woman so comical in her despair , that the children , after trying hard to keep it in , at last broke into shouts of laughter . She turned furiously upon them .</p>
   <p>“ It was you who did it ! ”</p>
   <p>“ No , indeed it was n't ! ” said they , jumping farther to escape her blows . For she had got one of her clothes-props , and was laying about her in the most reckless manner . However , she hurt nobody , and then she suddenly burst out , not laughing , but crying .</p>
   <p>“ It 's a cruel thing , whoever has done it , to play such tricks on a poor old body like me , with a sick husband that she works hard for , and not a child to help her . But I do n't care . I 'll wash my clothes again , if it 's twenty times over , and I 'll hang them out again in the very place , just to make you all ashamed of yourselves . ”</p>
   <p>Perhaps the little people were ashamed of themselves , though they really had not done the mischief . But they knew quite well who had done it , and more than once they were about to tell ; only they were afraid , if they did so , they should vex the Brownie so much that he would never come and play with them any more .</p>
   <p>So they looked at one another without speaking , and when the Gardener 's wife had emptied her basket and dried her eyes , they said to her , very kindly :</p>
   <p>“ Perhaps no harm may come to your clothes this time . We 'll sit and watch them till they are dry . ”</p>
   <p>“ Just as you like ; I do n't care . Them that hides can find , and them that plays tricks knows how to stop ‘ em . ”</p>
   <p>It was not a civil speech , but then things were hard for the poor old woman . She had been awake nearly all night , and up washing at daybreak ; her eyes were red with crying , and her steps weary and slow . The little children felt quite sorry for her , and , instead of going to play , sat watching the clothes as patiently as possible .</p>
   <p>Nothing came near them . Sometimes , as before , the things seemed to dance about without hands , and turn into odd shapes , as if there were people inside them ; but not a creature was seen and not a sound was heard . And though there was neither wind nor sun , very soon all the linen was perfectly dry .</p>
   <p>“ Fetch one of mother 's baskets , and we 'll fold it up as tidily as possible — that is , the girls can do it , it 's their business — and we boys will carry it safe to Gardener 's cottage . ”</p>
   <p>So said they , not liking to say that they could not trust it out of their sight for fear of Brownie , whom , indeed , they were expecting to see peer round from every bush . They began to have a secret fear that he was rather a naughty Brownie ; but then , as the eldest little girl whispered , “ He was only a Brownie , and knew no better . ” Now they were growing quite big children , who would be men and women some time ; when they hoped they would never do any thing wrong . ( Their parents hoped the same , but doubted it . )</p>
   <p>In a serious and careful manner they folded up the clothes , and laid them one by one in the basket without any mischief , until , just as the two biggest boys were lifting their burden to carry it away , they felt something tugging at it from underneath .</p>
   <p>“ Halloo ! Where are you taking all this rubbish ? Better give it to me . ”</p>
   <p>“ No , if you please , ” said they , very civilly , not to offend the little brown man . “ We 'll not trouble you , thanks ! We 'd rather do it ourselves ; for poor Gardener is very ill , and his wife is very miserable , and we are extremely sorry for them both . ”</p>
   <p>“ Extremely sorry ! ” cried Brownie , throwing up his cap in the air , and tumbling head over heels in an excited manner . “ What in the world does extremely sorry mean ? ”</p>
   <p>The children could not explain , especially to a Brownie ; but they thought they understood — anyhow , they felt it . And they looked so sorrowful that the Brownie could not tell what to make of it .</p>
   <p>He could not be said to be sorry , since , being a Brownie , and not a human being , knowing right from wrong , he never tried particularly to do right , and had no idea that he was doing wrong . But he seemed to have an idea that he was troubling the children , and he never liked to see them look unhappy .</p>
   <p>So he turned head over heels six times running , and then came back again .</p>
   <p>“ The silly old woman ! I washed her clothes for her last night in a way she did n't expect . I had n't any soap , so I used a little mud and coal-dust , and very pretty they looked . Ha , ha , ha ! Shall I wash them over again to-night ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Oh , no , please do n't ! ” implored the children .</p>
   <p>“ Shall I starch and iron them ? I 'll do it beautifully . One — two — three , five — six — seven , Abracadabra , tum — tum — ti ! ” shouted he , jabbering all sorts of nonsense , as it seemed to the children , and playing such antics that they stood and stared in the utmost amazement , and quite forgot the clothes . When they looked round again , the basket was gone .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Seek till you find , seek till you find ,</l>
     <l n="2">Under the biggest gooseberry-bush , exactly to your mind . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>They heard him singing this remarkable rhyme , long after they had lost sight of him . And then they all set about searching ; but it was a long while before they found , and still longer before they could decide , which was the biggest gooseberry-bush , each child having his or her opinion — sometimes a very strong one — on the matter . At last they agreed to settle it by pulling half-a-dozen little sticks , to see which stick was the longest , and the child that held it was to decide the gooseberry-bush .</p>
   <p>This done , underneath the branches what should they find but the identical basket of clothes ! only , instead of being roughly dried , they were all starched and ironed in the most beautiful manner . As for the shirts , they really were a picture to behold , and the stockings were all folded up , and even darned in one or two places , as neatly as possible . And strange to tell , there was not a single black mark of feet or fingers on any one of them .</p>
   <p>“ Kind little Brownie ! clever little Brownie ! ” cried the children in chorus , and thought this was the most astonishing trick he had ever played .</p>
   <p>What the Gardener 's wife said about it , whether they told her any thing , or allowed her to suppose that the clothes had been done in their own laundry instead of the Brownie 's ( wherever that establishment might be ) , is more than I can tell . Of one thing only I am certain — that the little people said nothing but what was true . Also , that the very minute they got home they told their mother every thing .</p>
   <p>But for a long time after that they were a good deal troubled . Gardener got better , and went hobbling about the place again , to his own and every body 's great content , and his wife was less sharp-tongued and complaining than usual — indeed , she had nothing to complain of . All the family were very flourishing , except the little Brownie .</p>
   <p>Often there was heard a curious sound all over the house ; it might have been rats squeaking behind the wainscot — the elders said it was — but the children were sure it was a sort of weeping and wailing .</p>

   <p>A most forlorn tune it was , ending in a dreary minor key , and it lasted for months and months — at least the children said it did . And they were growing quite dull for want of a playfellow , when , by the greatest good luck in the world , there came to the house not only a new lot of kittens , but a new baby . And the new baby was everybody 's pet , including the Brownie 's .</p>

    <p>The new baby was everybody 's pet .— Page 87</p>
   </figure>
   <p>From that time , though he was not often seen , he was continually heard up and down the staircase , where he was frequently mistaken for Tiny or the cat , and sent sharply down again , which was wasting a great deal of wholesome anger upon Mr. Nobody . Or he lurked in odd corners of the nursery , whither the baby was seen crawling eagerly after nothing in particular , or sitting laughing with all her might at something — probably her own toes .</p>
   <p>But , as Brownie was never seen , he was never suspected . And since he did no mischief — neither pinched the baby nor broke the toys , left no soap in the bath and no footmarks about the room — but was always a well-conducted Brownie in every way , he was allowed to inhabit the nursery ( or supposed to do so , since , as nobody saw him , nobody could prevent him ) , until the children were grown up into men and women .</p>
   <p>After that he retired into his coal-cellar , and , for all I know , he may live there still , and have gone through hundreds of adventures since ; but as I never heard them , I can n't tell them . Only I think , if I could be a little child again , I should exceedingly like a Brownie to play with me . Should not you ?</p>

    <head>THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A SLENDER young Blackbird built in a thorn-tree</l>
     <l n="2">A spruce little fellow as ever could be ;</l>
     <l n="3">His bill was so yellow , his feathers so black ,</l>
     <l n="4">So long was his tail , and so glossy his back ,</l>
     <l n="5">That good Mrs. B ., who sat hatching her eggs ,</l>
     <l n="6">And only just left them to stretch her poor legs ,</l>
     <l n="7">And pick for a minute the worm she preferred ,</l>
     <l n="8">Thought there never was seen such a beautiful bird .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">And such a kind husband ! how early and late</l>
     <l n="10">He would sit at the top of the old garden gate ,</l>
     <l n="11">And sing , just as merry as if it were June ,</l>
     <l n="12">Being ne'er out of patience , or temper , or tune .</l>
     <l n="13">“ So unlike those Rooks , dear ; from morning till night</l>
     <l n="14">They seem to do nothing but quarrel and fight ,</l>
     <l n="15">And wrangle and jangle , and plunder — while we</l>
     <l n="16">Sit , honest and safe , in our pretty thorn-tree . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Just while she was speaking , a lively young Rook</l>
     <l n="18">Alit with a flap that the thorn-bush quite shook ,</l>
     <l n="19">And seizing a stick from the nest — “ Come , I say ,</l>
     <l n="20">That will just suit me , neighbor ” — flew with it away</l>
     <l n="21">The lady loud twittered — her husband soon heard :</l>
     <l n="22">Though peaceful , he was not a cowardly bird ;</l>
     <l n="23">And with arguments angry enough to o'erwhelm</l>
     <l n="24">A whole Rookery — flew to the top of the elm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">“ How dare you , you — ” ( thief he was going to say ;</l>
     <l n="26">But a civiller sentiment came in the way :</l>
     <l n="27">For he knew ‘ tis no good , and it anyhow shames</l>
     <l n="28">A gentleman , calling strange gentlemen names :)</l>
     <l n="29">“ Pray what is your motive , Sir Rook , for such tricks ,</l>
     <l n="30">As building your mansion with other folks ’ sticks ?</l>
     <l n="31">I request you 'll restore them , in justice and law . ”</l>
     <l n="32">At which the whole colony set up a — caw !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">But Blackbird , not silenced , then spoke out again ;</l>
     <l n="34">“ I 've built my small nest with much labor and pain .</l>
     <l n="35">I 'm a poor singing gentleman , Sirs , it is true ,</l>
     <l n="36">Though cockneys do often mistake me for you ;</l>
     <l n="37">But I keep Mrs. Blackbird , and four little eggs ,</l>
     <l n="38">And neither e'er pilfers , or borrows , or begs .</l>
     <l n="39">Now have I not right on my side , do you see ? ”</l>
     <l n="40">But they flew at and pecked him all down the elm-tree .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="41">Ah ! wickedness prospers sometimes , I much fear ;</l>
     <l n="42">And virtue 's not always victorious , that 's clear :</l>
     <l n="43">At least , not at first : for it must be confessed</l>
     <l n="44">Poor Blackbird lost many a stick from his nest ;</l>
     <l n="45">And his unkind grand neighbors with scoffing caw-caws ,</l>
     <l n="46">In his voice and his character found many flaws ,</l>
     <l n="47">And jeered him and mocked him ; but when they 'd all done ,</l>
     <l n="48">He flew to his tree and sang cheerily on .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="49">At length May arrived with her garlands of leaves ;</l>
     <l n="50">The swallows were building beneath the farm-eaves ,</l>
     <l n="51">Wrens , linnets , and sparrows , on every hedge-side ,</l>
     <l n="52">Were bringing their families out with great pride ;</l>
     <l n="53">While far above all , on the tallest tree-top ,</l>
     <l n="54">With a flutter and clamor that never did stop ,</l>
     <l n="55">The haughty old Rooks held their heads up so high ,</l>
     <l n="56">And dreamed not of trouble — until it drew nigh !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="57">One morning at seven , as he came with delight</l>
     <l n="58">To his wife 's pretty parlor of may-blossoms white ,</l>
     <l n="59">Having fed all his family ere rise of sun ,—</l>
     <l n="60">Mr. Blackbird perceived — a big man with a gun ;</l>
     <l n="61">Who also perceived him : “ See , Charlie , among</l>
     <l n="62">That may , sits the Blackbird we 've heard for so long :</l>
     <l n="63">Most likely his nest 's there — how frightened he looks !</l>
     <l n="64">Nay , Blackie , we 're not come for you , but the Rooks . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="65">I do n't say ‘ twas cruel — I can n't say ‘ twas kind —</l>
     <l n="66">On the subject I have n't quite made up my mind :</l>
     <l n="67">But those guns went pop-popping all morning , alas !</l>
     <l n="68">And young Rooks kept dropping among the long grass ,</l>
     <l n="69">Till good Mr. Blackbird , who watched the whole thing ,</l>
     <l n="70">For pity could scarcely a single note sing ,</l>
     <l n="71">And in the May sunset he hardly could bear</l>
     <l n="72">To hear the returning Rooks ’ caw of despair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="73">“ O , dear Mrs. Blackbird , ” at last warbled he ,</l>
     <l n="74">“ How happy we are in our humble thorn-tree ;</l>
     <l n="75">How gaily we live , living honest and poor ,</l>
     <l n="76">How sweet are the may-blossoms over our door . ”</l>
     <l n="77">“ And then our dear children , ” the mother replied ,</l>
     <l n="78">And she nested them close to her warm feathered side ,</l>
     <l n="79">And with a soft twitter of drowsy content ,</l>
     <l n="80">In the quiet May moonlight to sleep they all went .</l>

    <head>THE SHAKING OF THE PEAR-TREE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">OF all days I remember ,</l>
     <l n="2">In summers passed away ,</l>
     <l n="3">Was “ the shaking of the pear-tree , ”</l>
     <l n="4">In grandma 's orchard gay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">A large old-fashioned orchard ,</l>
     <l n="6">With long grass under foot ,</l>
     <l n="7">And blackberry-brambles crawling</l>
     <l n="8">In many a tangled shoot .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">From cherry time , till damsons</l>
     <l n="10">Dropped from the branches sere ,</l>
     <l n="11">That wonderful old orchard</l>
     <l n="12">Was full of fruit all year ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">We pick 'd it up in baskets ,</l>
     <l n="14">Or pluck 'd it from the wall ;</l>
     <l n="15">But the shaking of the pear-tree</l>
     <l n="16">Was the grandest treat of all .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Long , long the days we counted</l>
     <l n="18">Until that day drew nigh ;</l>
     <l n="19">Then , how we watched the sun set ,</l>
     <l n="20">And criticised the sky !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">If rain — “ ‘ Twill clear at midnight ; ”</l>
     <l n="22">If dawn broke chill and gray ,</l>

     <l n="24">Turns out a lovely day . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">So off we started gaily ,</l>
     <l n="26">Heedless of jolt or jar ;</l>
     <l n="27">Through town and lane , and hamlet ,</l>
     <l n="28">In old Llewellyn 's car .</l>

     <l n="29">He 's dead and gone — Llewellyn ,</l>

     <l n="33">The patient , kind Llewellyn —</l>

     <l n="37">And there stood Grandma 's Betty ,</l>
     <l n="38">With cheeks like apples red ;</l>

     <l n="40">Out of his cosy bed .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="41">With silky ears down dropping ,</l>

     <l n="53">And teasing , teasing , teasing ,</l>
     <l n="54">Till afternoon wore round ,</l>

     <l n="56">In showers upon the ground .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="57">O how we jumped and shouted !</l>
     <l n="58">O how we plunged amid</l>

     <l n="60">Dropped down and deftly hid ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="61">Long , slender-shaped , red-russet ,</l>

     <l n="64">Like those sweet pears of old !</l>

     <l n="65">We ate — I 'd best not mention</l>

     <l n="68">Working with right good-will ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="69">Then hunted round the orchard</l>
     <l n="70">For half-ripe plums — in vain ;</l>

     <l n="72">To eat , and eat again .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="73">I 'm not on my confession ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="77">For pleasure has its ending ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="85">The children 's homeward silence ,</l>
     <l n="86">The furnace fires that glowed ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="89">And high , high set in heaven ,</l>
