    <head>CHAPTER I .</head>
     <l n="1">With a pipe between his lips ,</l>
     <l n="2">Two young dogs upon his hips ,</l>
     <l n="3">Jogs along old Caspar Sly ;</l>
     <l n="4">How that man can smoke ,— oh , my !</l>
     <l n="5">But although the pipe-bowl glows</l>
     <l n="6">Red and hot beneath his nose ;</l>
     <l n="7">Yet his heart is icy-cold ;</l>
     <l n="8">How can earth such wretches hold !</l>
     <l n="9">“ Of what earthly use to me</l>
     <l n="10">Can such brutes , ” he mutters , “ be ?</l>
     <l n="11">Do they earn their vittles ? No !</l>
     <l n="12">‘ Tis high time I let ‘ em go .</l>
     <l n="13">What you do n't want , fling away !</l>
     <l n="14">Them 's my sentiments , I say ! ”</l>
     <l n="15">O'er the pond he silent bends ,</l>
     <l n="16">For to drown them he intends .</l>
     <l n="17">With their legs the quadrupeds</l>
     <l n="18">Kick and squirm ,— can n't move their heads</l>
     <l n="19">And the inner voice speaks out :</l>
     <l n="20">How ‘ t will end we gravely doubt .</l>
     <l n="21">Hubs !— an airy curve one makes ;</l>
     <l n="22">Plish !— a headlong dive he takes .</l>
     <l n="23">Hubs !— the second follows suit ;</l>
     <l n="24">Plum !— the wave engulfs the brute .</l>
     <l n="25">“ That 's well ended , ” Caspar cries ,</l>
     <l n="26">Puffs away and homeward hies .</l>
     <l n="27">But , as often happens , here too</l>
     <l n="28">Things do n't go as they appear to .</l>
     <l n="29">Paul and Peter ,— so ‘ twas fated ,—</l>
     <l n="30">Naked in the bushes waited</l>
     <l n="31">For a swim ; and they descry</l>
     <l n="32">What was done by wicked Sly .</l>
     <l n="33">And like frogs they dove , kechunk ,</l>
     <l n="34">Where the poor young dogs had sunk .</l>
     <l n="35">Quickly each one with his hand</l>
     <l n="36">Drags a little dog to land .</l>
     <l n="37">“ Plish , I 'll call my dog , ” cried Paul ;</l>
     <l n="38">“ Plum , ” said Peter , “ mine I 'll call . ”</l>
     <l n="39">Paul and Peter then with pleasure ,</l>
     <l n="40">Tenderly took each his treasure ,</l>
     <l n="41">And , with speed and joy past telling ,</l>
     <l n="42">Steered for the parental dwelling .</l>

    <head>CHAPTER II .</head>
     <l n="1">Papa Fittig , calm and cosy ,</l>
     <l n="2">Mamma Fittig , round and rosy ,</l>
     <l n="3">Arm in arm sit peaceful there —</l>
     <l n="4">Troubled by no speck of care —</l>
     <l n="5">On the bench before the door ;</l>
     <l n="6">For the summer day is o'er ,</l>
     <l n="7">And the supper hour is near ,</l>
     <l n="8">And the lads will soon be here .</l>
     <l n="9">Soon they burst upon the view ,</l>
     <l n="10">Plish and Plum are with them too .</l>
     <l n="11">Fittig thinks a dog a plague :</l>
     <l n="12">“ Nah ! ” he cries ,— “ excuse , I beg ! ”</l>
     <l n="13">But mamma with soft looks pleaded :</l>
     <l n="14">“ Let them , Fittig ! ” — and succeeded .</l>
     <l n="15">Evening milk , fresh and delicious ,</l>
     <l n="16">On the table stood in dishes .</l>
     <l n="17">Joyfully they haste indoors ;</l>
     <l n="18">Plish and Plum ahead , of course .</l>
     <l n="19">Mercy ! look ! right in the sweet</l>
     <l n="20">Cream each wretch has set his feet ;</l>
     <l n="21">And the noise their lapping makes</l>
     <l n="22">Shows what comfort each one takes .</l>
     <l n="23">At the window peeps old Sly ,</l>
     <l n="24">Chuckles loud and says : “ My eye !</l>
     <l n="25">This is very bad , he ! he !</l>
     <l n="26">Very bad , but not for me !! ”</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>CHAPTER III .</head>
     <l n="1">When night came , all worn and tired ,</l>
     <l n="2">As if nothing had transpired ,</l>
     <l n="3">Paul and Peter in their chamber</l>
     <l n="4">Lay there , wrapt in peaceful slumber ,</l>
     <l n="5">A soft snoring through their noses</l>
     <l n="6">Shows how tranquilly each dozes .</l>
     <l n="7">But not so with Plish and Plum !</l>
     <l n="8">They sit ill-at-ease and glum ,</l>
     <l n="9">Not being lodged to suit their mind ,</l>
     <l n="10">To turn in they too inclined .</l>
     <l n="11">Plish , the dog 's old rule to follow ,</l>
     <l n="12">Turns round thrice , his bed to hollow ;</l>
     <l n="13">Plum , however , shows a mind</l>
     <l n="14">More affectionately inclined .</l>
     <l n="15">When we dream of perfect rest</l>
     <l n="16">Comes full many a troublous guest .</l>
     <l n="17">“ March ! ” With this harsh word the pets .</l>
     <l n="18">Turn their outward summersets</l>
     <l n="19">Coolness wakes activity ;</l>
     <l n="20">Time well-filled glides pleasantly .</l>
     <l n="21">Means of sport are handy too ,</l>
     <l n="22">Here a stocking — there a shoe .</l>
     <l n="23">These , before the morning glow ,</l>
     <l n="24">Curious changes undergo .</l>
     <l n="25">When he comes the boys to wake ,</l>
     <l n="26">And beholds the frightful wreck ,</l>
     <l n="27">Pale the father cries : “ This will</l>
     <l n="28">Be a monstrous heavy bill ! ”</l>
     <l n="29">Vengeful claws are in the air ;</l>
     <l n="30">Feigning sleep , the rogues lie there ;</l>
     <l n="31">But the mother begs : “ I pray ,</l>
     <l n="32">Fittig dear , thy wrath allay ! ”</l>
     <l n="33">And her loving words assuage</l>
     <l n="34">The stern father 's boiling rage .</l>
     <l n="35">Paul and Peter never care</l>
     <l n="36">How they look or what they wear .</l>
     <l n="37">Peter two old slippers gets ,</l>
     <l n="38">Paul his infant pantalets .</l>
     <l n="39">Plish and Plum , in morals blind ,</l>
     <l n="40">To the dog-house are confined .</l>
     <l n="41">“ This is bad ! ” says Sly , “ he ! he !</l>
     <l n="42">Very bad , but not for me ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>CHAPTER IV .</head>
     <l n="1">Caught at last in wiry house ,</l>
     <l n="2">Sits that most audacious mouse ,</l>
     <l n="3">Who , with many a nightly antic ,</l>
     <l n="4">Drove poor Mamma Fittig frantic ,—</l>
     <l n="5">Rioting , with paws erratic ,</l>
     <l n="6">From the cellar to the attic .</l>
     <l n="7">This event to Plish and Plum</l>
     <l n="8">Was a long-sought gaudium ;</l>
     <l n="9">For the word was : “ Stu-boys ! take him !</l>
     <l n="10">Seize the wicked grinder — shake him ! ”</l>
     <l n="11">Soft ! a refuge mousey reaches</l>
     <l n="12">In a leg of Peter 's breeches .</l>
     <l n="13">Through the leg-tube Plish pursues him ,</l>
     <l n="14">Plum makes sure he shall not lose him .</l>
     <l n="15">Nip ! the mousey with his tooth</l>
     <l n="16">Stings the smeller of the youth .</l>
     <l n="17">Plish essays to pull him clear ;</l>
     <l n="18">Nip ! the plague 's on Plish 's ear .</l>
     <l n="19">See ! they run heels over head ,</l>
     <l n="20">Into neighbor 's garden-bed .</l>
     <l n="21">Kritze-kratze ! what will be —</l>
     <l n="22">Come , sweet flower-plot , of thee ?</l>
     <l n="23">At that moment Madam Mieding ,</l>
     <l n="24">With fresh oil , her lamp is feeding ;</l>
     <l n="25">And her heart comes near to breaking ,</l>
     <l n="26">With those pests her garden wrecking .</l>
     <l n="27">Indignation lends her wings ,</l>
     <l n="28">And the oil-can , too , she brings .</l>
     <l n="29">Now , with mingling joy and wrath ,</l>
     <l n="30">She gives each a shower-bath —</l>
     <l n="31">First to Plish and then to Plum ,</l>
     <l n="32">Shower-bath of petroleum !</l>
     <l n="33">Of the effect that might be wrought ,</l>
     <l n="34">Madam Mieding had not thought .</l>
     <l n="35">But what presently took place ,</l>
     <l n="36">Right before this lady 's face ,</l>
     <l n="37">Made her shut her eyes , so dazed</l>
     <l n="38">That she smiled like one half crazed ,—</l>
     <l n="39">Drew a heavy sigh , and soon</l>
     <l n="40">Gasped and sank down in a swoon .</l>
     <l n="41">Paul and Peter , hard and cool ,</l>
     <l n="42">Heed not much the Golden Rule .</l>
     <l n="43">Suffering , stretched beside the way</l>
     <l n="44">Never once disturbs their play .</l>
     <l n="45">“ Bad enough ! ” says Sly ; “ he ! he !</l>
     <l n="46">Shocking bad ! but not for me ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>CHAPTER V .</head>
     <l n="1">Breeches short and long surtout ,</l>
     <l n="2">Crooked nose and cane to suit ,</l>
     <l n="3">Gray of soul and black of eye ,</l>
     <l n="4">Hat slouched back , expression sly —</l>
     <l n="5">Such is old Sol Shuffleshins ;</l>
     <l n="6">How complacently he grins !</l>
     <l n="7">Fittig 's door he 's passing now ;</l>
     <l n="8">Hark ! a furious , row-wow-wow !</l>
     <l n="9">Scarcely has the echo gone ,</l>
     <l n="10">When the following scene comes on .</l>
     <l n="11">Turn and twist him as he will ,</l>
     <l n="12">Plish and Plum stick to him still ;</l>
     <l n="13">Underneath his long surtout</l>
     <l n="14">Tugs and tears each crazy brute .</l>
     <l n="15">Shall that happen twice ? not quite !</l>
     <l n="16">Mind shall triumph over might !</l>
     <l n="17">Presto ! What strange dog is there ,</l>
     <l n="18">Hat in mouth ? the young ones stare .</l>
     <l n="19">What queer quadruped can he ,</l>
     <l n="20">Backing toward the doorway , be ?</l>
     <l n="21">Mrs. Fittig hears the clatter ,</l>
     <l n="22">Comes to see what is the matter .</l>
     <l n="23">Soft as on a mossy bank ,</l>
     <l n="24">In her lap Sol backward sank .</l>
     <l n="25">Fittig also came in view .</l>
     <l n="26">“ Ow ! ” cried Sol , “ I 'm torn in two !</l>
     <l n="27">Herr von Fittig pays me for ‘ t ,</l>
     <l n="28">Or I 'll carry it to court ! ”</l>
     <l n="29">He must pay ; that makes him pout</l>
     <l n="30">Worse than having ten teeth out .</l>
     <l n="31">In despair he casts askance</l>
     <l n="32">At that youthful pair a glance ,—</l>
     <l n="33">Seeming plainly to confess ,</l>
     <l n="34">“ I 've no words your shame to express ”</l>
     <l n="35">Little care the hardened creatures</l>
     <l n="36">For their parent 's play of features .</l>
     <l n="37">“ Bad enough ! ” says Sly , “ he ! he !</l>
     <l n="38">Awful bad ! but not for me ! ”</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>CHAPTER VI .</head>
     <l n="1">Plish and Plum , their deeds declare ,</l>
     <l n="2">Are a graceless , low-lived pair .</l>
     <l n="3">Yet they live in close communion ;</l>
     <l n="4">And for that , in my opinion ,</l>
     <l n="5">They deserve some commendation ;</l>
     <l n="6">But will ‘ t be of long duration ?</l>
     <l n="7">“ Rogue &amp; Co . ” — such firm , be sure ,</l>
     <l n="8">Cannot many days endure .</l>
     <l n="9">In the sunshine , vis-a-vis ,</l>
     <l n="10">Sits a lap-dog , fair to see .</l>
     <l n="11">To our pair this lovely sight</l>
     <l n="12">Is a rare and keen delight .</l>
     <l n="13">Each would gain the foremost place</l>
     <l n="14">To behold that beauteous face .</l>
     <l n="15">If the front is gained by Plish ,</l>
     <l n="16">Plum looks glum and dismalish ;</l>
     <l n="17">Then if it is seized by Plum ,</l>
     <l n="18">That makes Plish exceeding glum .</l>
     <l n="19">Soon low-muttering thunders growl ,</l>
     <l n="20">Paws scratch gravel , eyeballs roll ,</l>
     <l n="21">And the furious fight begins ;</l>
     <l n="22">Plum cuts dirt , his brother wins .</l>
     <l n="23">Mamma Fittig stands and makes</l>
     <l n="24">Chicken salad and pancakes ,—</l>
     <l n="25">Those well known and favorite dishes ,</l>
     <l n="26">Every child devoutly wishes .</l>
     <l n="27">Whirr ! right through the window come ,</l>
     <l n="28">Helter-skelter , Plish and Plum .</l>
     <l n="29">Pot and pan and stove and stew</l>
     <l n="30">Mingle in one grand ragout .</l>
     <l n="31">“ Wait ! you vile Plish ! ” Peter holloos ,</l>
     <l n="32">And the word instanter follows</l>
     <l n="33">With a well-aimed blow ; but Paul</l>
     <l n="34">Does n't relish that at all .</l>
     <l n="35">“ What d ’ ye mean , to strike my creatur ’ ? ”</l>
     <l n="36">Cries out Paul , and lashes Peter ;</l>
     <l n="37">Who , inflamed with pain and passion ,</l>
     <l n="38">Winds up Paul in curious fashion .</l>
     <l n="39">Now the battle desperate grows ;</l>
     <l n="40">Each the costly salad throws ,</l>
     <l n="41">In a frenzy , at his brother ,</l>
     <l n="42">And they poultice one another .</l>
     <l n="43">In comes papa Fittig , hasting</l>
     <l n="44">To inflict on them a basting .</l>
     <l n="45">Mamma Fittig , full of kindness ,</l>
     <l n="46">Fearing anger 's headlong blindness ,</l>
     <l n="47">Cries , “ Best Fittig ! pray consider ! ”</l>
     <l n="48">But her zeal for once undid her .</l>
     <l n="49">Her lace cap , so nice and new ,</l>
     <l n="50">Fittig 's cane has bored quite through .</l>
     <l n="51">Laughs the wicked Sly , “ He ! he !</l>
     <l n="52">All are done for , now , I see ! ”</l>
     <l n="53">He who laughs at others ’ woes</l>
     <l n="54">Makes few friends and many foes .</l>
     <l n="55">Hot and heavy the old chap</l>
     <l n="56">Finds , I guess , the pancake cap .</l>
     <l n="57">“ Bad , ” said Sly , “ as bad can be ,</l>
     <l n="58">And this once , too , bad for me ! ”</l>

     <l n="1">So now there sit Plish and Plum ,</l>
     <l n="2">Very dull and very glum .</l>
     <l n="3">Two strong chains , and short , did hem</l>
     <l n="4">The activity of them .</l>
     <l n="5">Fittig seriously reflected :</l>
     <l n="6">“ This must somehow be corrected !</l>
     <l n="7">Virtue needs encouragement ;</l>
     <l n="8">Vice gets on by natural bent . ”</l>
     <l n="9">Paul and Peter now began</l>
     <l n="10">Schooling with Herr Buckleman .</l>
     <l n="11">At the first day 's session he</l>
     <l n="12">Thus addressed them pleasantly :</l>
     <l n="13">“ Dear lads ,— I assure you , I am very</l>
     <l n="14">Glad you have come to this seminary ;</l>
     <l n="15">And , as I hope , with all your powers</l>
     <l n="16">Intend to improve these precious hours .</l>
     <l n="17">And first , the things most important to mention ,</l>
     <l n="18">Reading , writing , and ciphering will claim our attention ;</l>
     <l n="19">For these are the arts by which man rises</l>
     <l n="20">To honor and wealth , and wins great prizes .</l>
     <l n="21">But , secondly , what good would all this do ,</l>
     <l n="22">Unless politeness were added thereto ?</l>
     <l n="23">For he who is not polite to all</l>
     <l n="24">Into trouble will certainly fall .</l>
     <l n="25">Finally , therefore , bending before you ,</l>
     <l n="26">As you see , I entreat and implore you ,</l>
     <l n="27">If in good faith you have made up your mind</l>
     <l n="28">To follow the rules I have now defined ,</l>
     <l n="29">Then lift up your hands and look me in the eye ,</l>
     <l n="30">And say , ‘ Herr Buckleman , we will try ! ’ ”</l>
     <l n="31">Paul and Peter thought : “ Old man ,</l>
     <l n="32">D'ye think us greenhorns ? Is that your plan ? ”</l>
     <l n="33">They give no answer , but inwardly</l>
     <l n="34">They grin and giggle , and say , “ he ! he ! ”</l>
     <l n="35">Whereat old Master Buckleman</l>
     <l n="36">Gave a low whistle , and thus began :</l>
     <l n="37">“ Since , then , you 've resolved to be</l>
     <l n="38">Hardened reprobates , ” said he ,</l>
     <l n="39">“ I am resolved , face down , to lay</l>
     <l n="40">You both across my desk straightway ,</l>
     <l n="41">Applying the stick to your hinder parts</l>
     <l n="42">In hopes of softening your hard hearts . ”</l>
     <l n="43">Drawing out then from beneath</l>
     <l n="44">His coat , like sabre from its sheath ,</l>
     <l n="45">His good hazel rod , of stuff</l>
     <l n="46">Flexible and tight and tough ,—</l>
     <l n="47">He with many a sturdy thwack</l>
     <l n="48">Laid it on each urchin 's back .</l>
     <l n="49">Nay , he trounced two backs in one ,</l>
     <l n="50">Till he deemed the work was done .</l>
     <l n="51">“ Now then , ” he spoke in a tranquil way ,</l>
     <l n="52">“ Beloved children , what do you say ?</l>
     <l n="53">Are you content and are we agreed ? ”</l>
     <l n="54">“ Yes , yes , Herr Buckleman ,— yes , indeed ! ”</l>
     <l n="55">Such was the method of Buckleman ;</l>
     <l n="56">We see the good effects of his plan .</l>
     <l n="57">‘ Twas the talk of the people , one and all ,—</l>
     <l n="58">“ Charming children — Peter and Paul ! ”</l>
     <l n="59">And so they tried it on Plish and Plum :</l>
     <l n="60">They too , also , to school must come .</l>
     <l n="61">And the Buckleman plan 's applied</l>
     <l n="62">Faithfully to each one 's hide .</l>
     <l n="63">Masters of Arts , they 're soon approved ,</l>
     <l n="64">And universally beloved ;</l>
     <l n="65">And , as one might well expect ,</l>
     <l n="66">Art shows practical effect .</l>

    <head>CONCLUSION .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">One day travelling through the land ,</l>
     <l n="2">With a field-glass in his hand ,</l>
     <l n="3">A well-dressed man of fortune came ;</l>
     <l n="4">Mister Peep , they called his name .</l>
     <l n="5">“ Ca n't I , as I pass , ” said he ,</l>
     <l n="6">“ View the distant scenery ?</l>
     <l n="7">Beauty reigns elsewhere , I know ,</l>
     <l n="8">Whereas here ‘ tis but so-so . ”</l>
     <l n="9">Here he pitched into the pond ,</l>
     <l n="10">Viewed the mud and naught beyond .</l>
     <l n="11">“ Paul and Peter ,— look and see</l>
     <l n="12">Where the gentleman can be ! ”</l>
     <l n="13">So said Fittig , who just then</l>
     <l n="14">Walked forth with the little men ;</l>
     <l n="15">But fu'l soon it was made plain</l>
     <l n="16">Where the gentleman had lain ,</l>
     <l n="17">When he , minus hat and glass ,</l>
     <l n="18">Stood all dripping on the grass .</l>
     <l n="19">“ Allez ! Plish and Plum , apport ! ”</l>
     <l n="20">Came the order from the shore .</l>
     <l n="21">Strictly trained to fetch and carry ,—</l>
     <l n="22">Not a moment did they tarry ,—</l>
     <l n="23">Fetched the lost goods from the deep .</l>
     <l n="24">“ Very well , ” cried Mister Peep .</l>
     <l n="25">“ Nice dogs , friend , I 'll buy the two ;</l>
     <l n="26">How 'll a hundred dollars do ? ”</l>
     <l n="27">Papa Fittig 's head inclined :</l>
     <l n="28">“ The gentleman is very kind . ”</l>
     <l n="29">On new legs he seems to stand ,</l>
     <l n="30">Such a pile of cash in hand .</l>
     <l n="31">“ Ah , you darlings , Plish and Plum !</l>
     <l n="32">We must part — the hour has come —</l>
     <l n="33">On this very spot , right here ,</l>
     <l n="34">Where we four , this time last year ,</l>
     <l n="35">Were united , by the pond ,</l>
     <l n="36">In a sweet and solemn bond .</l>
     <l n="37">May your life in peace be led ,</l>
     <l n="38">With beefsteak for daily bread . ”</l>
     <l n="39">Now all this was seen by Sly ,</l>
     <l n="40">Just then happening to pass by .</l>
     <l n="41">“ Very pleasant , ” mutters he ,</l>
     <l n="42">“ Yes , no doubt , but not for me . ”</l>
     <l n="43">Envy , like a poisoned dart ,</l>
     <l n="44">Stung him to the very heart .</l>
     <l n="45">All before him misty grows ;</l>
     <l n="46">Legs give way and back he goes ,</l>
     <l n="47">Down into the oozy damp ;</l>
     <l n="48">Quenched forever is life 's lamp !</l>
     <l n="49">Left alone upon the shore ,</l>
     <l n="50">Quickened by his breath no more ,</l>
     <l n="51">Faintly gleams the expiring soul</l>
     <l n="52">Of the pipe within the bowl ;</l>
     <l n="53">One blue cloud I see ascend ,</l>
     <l n="54">Futt ! the tale is at an</l>
     <l n="55">End .</l>
