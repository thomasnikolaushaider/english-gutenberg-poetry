    <p>+ Inscribed to a dear Child : in memory of golden summer hours and whispers of a summer sea .+ Girt with a boyish garb for boyish task , Eager she wields her spade : yet loves as well Rest on a friendly knee , intent to ask The tale he loves to tell . Rude spirits of the seething outer strife , Unmeet to read her pure and simple spright , Deem , if you list , such hours a waste of life , Empty of all delight ! Chat on , sweet Maid , and rescue from annoy Hearts that by wiser talk are unbeguiled . Ah , happy he who owns that tenderest joy , The heart-love of a child ! Away , fond thoughts , and vex my soul no more ! Work claims my wakeful nights , my busy days — Albeit bright memories of that sunlit shore Yet haunt my dreaming gaze !</p>

    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">If — and the thing is wildly possible — the charge of writing nonsense were ever brought against the author of this brief but instructive poem , it would be based , I feel convinced , on the line ( in p. 18 )</p>
    <p n="2">“ Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes .”</p>
    <p n="3">In view of this painful possibility , I will not ( as I might ) appeal indignantly to my other writings as a proof that I am incapable of such a deed : I will not ( as I might ) point to the strong moral purpose of this poem itself , to the arithmetical principles so cautiously inculcated in it , or to its noble teachings in Natural History — I will take the more prosaic course of simply explaining how it happened .</p>
    <p n="4">The Bellman , who was almost morbidly sensitive about appearances , used to have the bowsprit unshipped once or twice a week to be revarnished , and it more than once happened , when the time came for replacing it , that no one on board could remember which end of the ship it belonged to . They knew it was not of the slightest use to appeal to the Bellman about it — he would only refer to his Naval Code , and read out in pathetic tones Admiralty Instructions which none of them had ever been able to understand — so it generally ended in its being fastened on , anyhow , across the rudder . The helmsman * used to stand by with tears in his eyes : he knew it was all wrong , but alas ! Rule 42 of the Code , “ No one shall speak to the Man at the Helm ,” had been completed by the Bellman himself with the words “ and the Man at the Helm shall speak to no one .” So remonstrance was impossible , and no steering could be done till the next varnishing day . During these bewildering intervals the ship usually sailed backwards .</p>
    <p n="5">[* This office was usually undertaken by the Boots , who found in it a refuge from the Baker ’ s constant complaints about the insufficient blacking of his three pair of boots . ]</p>
    <p n="6">As this poem is to some extent connected with the lay of the Jabberwock , let me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been asked me , how to pronounce “ slithy toves .” The “ i ” in “ slithy ” is long , as in “ writhe ”; and “ toves ” is pronounced so as to rhyme with “ groves .” Again , the first “ o ” in “ borogoves ” is pronounced like the “ o ” in “ borrow .” I have heard people try to give it the sound of the “ o ” in “ worry .” Such is Human Perversity .</p>
    <p n="7">This also seems a fitting occasion to notice the other hard words in that poem . Humpty-Dumpty ’ s theory , of two meanings packed into one word like a portmanteau , seems to me the right explanation for all .</p>
    <p n="8">For instance , take the two words “ fuming ” and “ furious .” Make up your mind that you will say both words , but leave it unsettled which you will say first . Now open your mouth and speak . If your thoughts incline ever so little towards “ fuming ,” you will say “ fuming-furious ;” if they turn , by even a hair ’ s breadth , towards “ furious ,” you will say “ furious-fuming ;” but if you have that rarest of gifts , a perfectly balanced mind , you will say “ frumious .”</p>
    <p n="9">Supposing that , when Pistol uttered the well-known words —</p>
    <p n="10">“ Under which king , Bezonian ? Speak or die !”</p>
    <p n="11">Justice Shallow had felt certain that it was either William or Richard , but had not been able to settle which , so that he could not possibly say either name before the other , can it be doubted that , rather than die , he would have gasped out “ Rilchiam !”</p>

    <head>THE LANDING .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Just the place for a Snark !” the Bellman cried ,</l>
     <l n="2">As he landed his crew with care ;</l>
     <l n="3">Supporting each man on the top of the tide</l>
     <l n="4">By a finger entwined in his hair .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ Just the place for a Snark ! I have said it twice :</l>
     <l n="6">That alone should encourage the crew .</l>
     <l n="7">Just the place for a Snark ! I have said it thrice :</l>
     <l n="8">What I tell you three times is true .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">The crew was complete : it included a Boots —</l>
     <l n="10">A maker of Bonnets and Hoods —</l>
     <l n="11">A Barrister , brought to arrange their disputes —</l>
     <l n="12">And a Broker , to value their goods .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">A Billiard-marker , whose skill was immense ,</l>
     <l n="14">Might perhaps have won more than his share —</l>
     <l n="15">But a Banker , engaged at enormous expense ,</l>
     <l n="16">Had the whole of their cash in his care .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">There was also a Beaver , that paced on the deck ,</l>
     <l n="18">Or would sit making lace in the bow :</l>
     <l n="19">And had often ( the Bellman said ) saved them from wreck ,</l>
     <l n="20">Though none of the sailors knew how .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="22">There was one who was famed for the number of things</l>
     <l n="23">He forgot when he entered the ship :</l>
     <l n="24">His umbrella , his watch , all his jewels and rings ,</l>
     <l n="25">And the clothes he had bought for the trip .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="26">He had forty-two boxes , all carefully packed ,</l>
     <l n="27">With his name painted clearly on each :</l>
     <l n="28">But , since he omitted to mention the fact ,</l>
     <l n="29">They were all left behind on the beach .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="30">The loss of his clothes hardly mattered , because</l>
     <l n="31">He had seven coats on when he came ,</l>
     <l n="32">With three pair of boots — but the worst of it was ,</l>
     <l n="33">He had wholly forgotten his name .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="34">He would answer to “ Hi !” or to any loud cry ,</l>
     <l n="35">Such as “ Fry me !” or “ Fritter my wig !”</l>
     <l n="36">To “ What-you-may-call-um !” or “ What-was-his-name !”</l>
     <l n="37">But especially “ Thing-um-a-jig !”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="38">While , for those who preferred a more forcible word ,</l>
     <l n="39">He had different names from these :</l>
     <l n="40">His intimate friends called him “ Candle-ends ,”</l>
     <l n="41">And his enemies “ Toasted-cheese .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="42">“ His form is ungainly — his intellect small —”</l>
     <l n="43">( So the Bellman would often remark )</l>
     <l n="44">“ But his courage is perfect ! And that , after all ,</l>
     <l n="45">Is the thing that one needs with a Snark .”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="46">He would joke with hyænas , returning their stare</l>
     <l n="47">With an impudent wag of the head :</l>
     <l n="48">And he once went a walk , paw-in-paw , with a bear ,</l>
     <l n="49">“ Just to keep up its spirits ,” he said .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="50">He came as a Baker : but owned , when too late —</l>
     <l n="51">And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad —</l>
     <l n="52">He could only bake Bridecake — for which , I may state ,</l>
     <l n="53">No materials were to be had .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="54">The last of the crew needs especial remark ,</l>
     <l n="55">Though he looked an incredible dunce :</l>
     <l n="56">He had just one idea — but , that one being “ Snark ,”</l>
     <l n="57">The good Bellman engaged him at once .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="58">He came as a Butcher : but gravely declared ,</l>
     <l n="59">When the ship had been sailing a week ,</l>
     <l n="60">He could only kill Beavers . The Bellman looked scared ,</l>
     <l n="61">And was almost too frightened to speak :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="62">But at length he explained , in a tremulous tone ,</l>
     <l n="63">There was only one Beaver on board ;</l>
     <l n="64">And that was a tame one he had of his own ,</l>
     <l n="65">Whose death would be deeply deplored .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="66">The Beaver , who happened to hear the remark ,</l>
     <l n="67">Protested , with tears in its eyes ,</l>
     <l n="68">That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark</l>
     <l n="69">Could atone for that dismal surprise !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="71">It strongly advised that the Butcher should be</l>
     <l n="72">Conveyed in a separate ship :</l>
     <l n="73">But the Bellman declared that would never agree</l>
     <l n="74">With the plans he had made for the trip :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="75">Navigation was always a difficult art ,</l>
     <l n="76">Though with only one ship and one bell :</l>
     <l n="77">And he feared he must really decline , for his part ,</l>
     <l n="78">Undertaking another as well .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="79">The Beaver ’ s best course was , no doubt , to procure</l>
     <l n="80">A second-hand dagger-proof coat —</l>
     <l n="81">So the Baker advised it — and next , to insure</l>
     <l n="82">Its life in some Office of note :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="83">This the Banker suggested , and offered for hire</l>
     <l n="84">( On moderate terms ) , or for sale ,</l>
     <l n="85">Two excellent Policies , one Against Fire ,</l>
     <l n="86">And one Against Damage From Hail .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="87">Yet still , ever after that sorrowful day ,</l>
     <l n="88">Whenever the Butcher was by ,</l>
     <l n="89">The Beaver kept looking the opposite way ,</l>
     <l n="90">And appeared unaccountably shy .</l>

     <l n="1">The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies —</l>
     <l n="2">Such a carriage , such ease and such grace !</l>
     <l n="3">Such solemnity , too ! One could see he was wise ,</l>
     <l n="4">The moment one looked in his face !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">He had bought a large map representing the sea ,</l>
     <l n="6">Without the least vestige of land :</l>

     <l n="22">This was charming , no doubt : but they shortly found out</l>

     <l n="26">He was thoughtful and grave — but the orders he gave</l>

     <l n="10">He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court ,</l>
     <l n="11">Where the Snark , with a glass in its eye ,</l>
     <l n="12">Dressed in gown , bands , and wig , was defending a pig</l>
     <l n="13">On the charge of deserting its sty .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="14">The Witnesses proved , without error or flaw ,</l>
     <l n="15">That the sty was deserted when found :</l>
     <l n="16">And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law</l>
     <l n="17">In a soft under-current of sound .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="18">The indictment had never been clearly expressed ,</l>
     <l n="19">And it seemed that the Snark had begun ,</l>
     <l n="20">And had spoken three hours , before any one guessed</l>
     <l n="21">What the pig was supposed to have done .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="22">The Jury had each formed a different view</l>
     <l n="23">( Long before the indictment was read ) ,</l>
     <l n="24">And they all spoke at once , so that none of them knew</l>
     <l n="25">One word that the others had said .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="26">“ You must know —” said the Judge : but the Snark exclaimed “ Fudge !</l>
     <l n="27">That statute is obsolete quite !</l>
     <l n="28">Let me tell you , my friends , the whole question depends</l>
     <l n="29">On an ancient manorial right .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="30">“ In the matter of Treason the pig would appear</l>
     <l n="31">To have aided , but scarcely abetted :</l>
     <l n="32">While the charge of Insolvency fails , it is clear ,</l>
     <l n="33">If you grant the plea ‘ never indebted .’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="34">“ The fact of Desertion I will not dispute :</l>

     <l n="36">( So far as relates to the costs of this suit )</l>
     <l n="37">By the Alibi which has been proved .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="38">“ My poor client ’ s fate now depends on your votes .”</l>
     <l n="39">Here the speaker sat down in his place ,</l>
     <l n="40">And directed the Judge to refer to his notes</l>
     <l n="41">And briefly to sum up the case .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="42">But the Judge said he never had summed up before ;</l>
     <l n="43">So the Snark undertook it instead ,</l>
     <l n="44">And summed it so well that it came to far more</l>
     <l n="45">Than the Witnesses ever had said !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="46">When the verdict was called for , the Jury declined ,</l>
     <l n="47">As the word was so puzzling to spell ;</l>
     <l n="48">But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn ’ t mind</l>
     <l n="49">Undertaking that duty as well .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="50">So the Snark found the verdict , although , as it owned ,</l>
     <l n="51">It was spent with the toils of the day :</l>
     <l n="52">When it said the word “ GUILTY !” the Jury all groaned ,</l>
     <l n="53">And some of them fainted away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="54">Then the Snark pronounced sentence , the Judge being quite</l>
     <l n="55">Too nervous to utter a word :</l>
     <l n="56">When it rose to its feet , there was silence like night ,</l>
     <l n="57">And the fall of a pin might be heard .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="58">“ Transportation for life ” was the sentence it gave ,</l>
     <l n="59">“ And then to be fined forty pound .”</l>
     <l n="60">The Jury all cheered , though the Judge said he feared</l>
     <l n="61">That the phrase was not legally sound .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="62">But their wild exultation was suddenly checked</l>
     <l n="63">When the jailer informed them , with tears ,</l>
     <l n="64">Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect ,</l>
     <l n="65">As the pig had been dead for some years .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="66">The Judge left the Court , looking deeply disgusted :</l>
     <l n="67">But the Snark , though a little aghast ,</l>
     <l n="68">As the lawyer to whom the defence was intrusted ,</l>
     <l n="69">Went bellowing on to the last .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="70">Thus the Barrister dreamed , while the bellowing seemed</l>
     <l n="71">To grow every moment more clear :</l>
     <l n="72">Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell ,</l>
     <l n="73">Which the Bellman rang close at his ear .</l>
