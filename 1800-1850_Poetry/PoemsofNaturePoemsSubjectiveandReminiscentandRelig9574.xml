      <head>THE FROST SPIRIT</head>
       <l n="1">He comes ,— he comes ,— the Frost Spirit comes</l>
       <l n="2">You may trace his footsteps now</l>
       <l n="3">On the naked woods and the blasted fields and the</l>
       <l n="4">brown hill 's withered brow .</l>
       <l n="5">He has smitten the leaves of the gray old trees</l>
       <l n="6">where their pleasant green came forth ,</l>
       <l n="7">And the winds , which follow wherever he goes ,</l>
       <l n="8">have shaken them down to earth .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>He comes ,— he comes ,— the Frost Spirit comes ! from the frozen Labrador , From the icy bridge of the Northern seas , which the white bear wanders o'er , Where the fisherman 's sail is stiff with ice , and the luckless forms below In the sunless cold of the lingering night into marble statues grow</p>
     <p>He comes ,— he comes ,— the Frost Spirit comes on the rushing Northern blast , And the dark Norwegian pines have bowed as his fearful breath went past . With an unscorched wing he has hurried on , where the fires of Hecla glow On the darkly beautiful sky above and the ancient ice below .</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">He comes ,— he comes ,— the Frost Spirit comes</l>
       <l n="2">and the quiet lake shall feel</l>
       <l n="3">The torpid touch of his glazing breath , and ring to</l>
       <l n="4">the skater 's heel ;</l>
       <l n="5">And the streams which danced on the broken</l>
       <l n="6">rocks , or sang to the leaning grass ,</l>
       <l n="7">Shall bow again to their winter chain , and in</l>
       <l n="8">mournful silence pass .</l>
       <l n="9">He comes ,— he comes ,— the Frost Spirit comes !</l>
       <l n="10">Let us meet him as we may ,</l>
       <l n="11">And turn with the light of the parlor-fire his evil</l>
       <l n="12">power away ;</l>
       <l n="13">And gather closer the circle round , when that</l>
       <l n="14">fire-light dances high ,</l>
       <l n="15">And laugh at the shriek of the baffled Fiend as</l>
       <l n="16">his sounding wing goes by !</l>

      <head>THE MERRIMAC .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ The Indians speak of a beautiful river , far to the south ,</l>
       <l n="2">which they call Merrimac . ” — SIEUR . DE MONTS , 1604 .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">Stream of my fathers ! sweetly still</l>
       <l n="4">The sunset rays thy valley fill ;</l>
       <l n="5">Poured slantwise down the long defile ,</l>
       <l n="6">Wave , wood , and spire beneath them smile .</l>
       <l n="7">I see the winding Powow fold</l>
       <l n="8">The green hill in its belt of gold ,</l>
       <l n="9">And following down its wavy line ,</l>
       <l n="10">Its sparkling waters blend with thine .</l>
       <l n="11">There ‘ s not a tree upon thy side ,</l>
       <l n="12">Nor rock , which thy returning tide</l>
       <l n="13">As yet hath left abrupt and stark</l>
       <l n="14">Above thy evening water-mark ;</l>
       <l n="15">No calm cove with its rocky hem ,</l>
       <l n="16">No isle whose emerald swells begin</l>
       <l n="17">Thy broad , smooth current ; not a sail</l>
       <l n="18">Bowed to the freshening ocean gale ;</l>
       <l n="19">No small boat with its busy oars ,</l>
       <l n="20">Nor gray wall sloping to thy shores ;</l>
       <l n="21">Nor farm-house with its maple shade ,</l>
       <l n="22">Or rigid poplar colonnade ,</l>
       <l n="23">But lies distinct and full in sight ,</l>
       <l n="24">Beneath this gush of sunset light .</l>
       <l n="25">Centuries ago , that harbor-bar ,</l>
       <l n="26">Stretching its length of foam afar ,</l>
       <l n="27">And Salisbury 's beach of shining sand ,</l>
       <l n="28">And yonder island 's wave-smoothed strand ,</l>
       <l n="29">Saw the adventurer 's tiny sail ,</l>
       <l n="30">Flit , stooping from the eastern gale ;</l>
       <l n="31">And o'er these woods and waters broke</l>
       <l n="32">The cheer from Britain 's hearts of oak ,</l>
       <l n="33">As brightly on the voyager 's eye ,</l>
       <l n="34">Weary of forest , sea , and sky ,</l>
       <l n="35">Breaking the dull continuous wood ,</l>
       <l n="36">The Merrimac rolled down his flood ;</l>
       <l n="37">Mingling that clear pellucid brook ,</l>
       <l n="38">Which channels vast Agioochook</l>
       <l n="39">When spring-time 's sun and shower unlock</l>
       <l n="40">The frozen fountains of the rock ,</l>
       <l n="41">And more abundant waters given</l>
       <l n="42">From that pure lake , “ The Smile of Heaven , ”</l>
       <l n="43">Tributes from vale and mountain-side ,—</l>
       <l n="44">With ocean 's dark , eternal tide !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="45">On yonder rocky cape , which braves</l>
       <l n="46">The stormy challenge of the waves ,</l>
       <l n="47">Midst tangled vine and dwarfish wood ,</l>
       <l n="48">The hardy Anglo-Saxon stood ,</l>
       <l n="49">Planting upon the topmost crag</l>
       <l n="50">The staff of England 's battle-flag ;</l>
       <l n="51">And , while from out its heavy fold</l>
       <l n="52">Saint George 's crimson cross unrolled ,</l>
       <l n="53">Midst roll of drum and trumpet blare ,</l>
       <l n="54">And weapons brandishing in air ,</l>
       <l n="55">He gave to that lone promontory</l>
       <l n="56">The sweetest name in all his story ;</l>
       <l n="57">Of her , the flower of Islam 's daughters ,</l>
       <l n="58">Whose harems look on Stamboul 's waters ,—</l>
       <l n="59">Who , when the chance of war had bound</l>
       <l n="60">The Moslem chain his limbs around ,</l>
       <l n="61">Wreathed o'er with silk that iron chain ,</l>
       <l n="62">Soothed with her smiles his hours of pain ,</l>
       <l n="63">And fondly to her youthful slave</l>
       <l n="64">A dearer gift than freedom gave .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="65">But look ! the yellow light no more</l>
       <l n="66">Streams down on wave and verdant shore ;</l>
       <l n="67">And clearly on the calm air swells</l>
       <l n="68">The twilight voice of distant bells .</l>
       <l n="69">From Ocean 's bosom , white and thin ,</l>
       <l n="70">The mists come slowly rolling in ;</l>
       <l n="71">Hills , woods , the river 's rocky rim ,</l>
       <l n="72">Amidst the sea — like vapor swim ,</l>
       <l n="73">While yonder lonely coast-light , set</l>
       <l n="74">Within its wave-washed minaret ,</l>
       <l n="75">Half quenched , a beamless star and pale ,</l>
       <l n="76">Shines dimly through its cloudy veil !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="77">Home of my fathers !— I have stood</l>
       <l n="78">Where Hudson rolled his lordly flood</l>
       <l n="79">Seen sunrise rest and sunset fade</l>
       <l n="80">Along his frowning Palisade ;</l>
       <l n="81">Looked down the Appalachian peak</l>
       <l n="82">On Juniata 's silver streak ;</l>
       <l n="83">Have seen along his valley gleam</l>
       <l n="84">The Mohawk 's softly winding stream ;</l>
       <l n="85">The level light of sunset shine</l>
       <l n="86">Through broad Potomac 's hem of pine ;</l>
       <l n="87">And autumn 's rainbow-tinted banner</l>
       <l n="88">Hang lightly o'er the Susquehanna ;</l>
       <l n="89">Yet wheresoe'er his step might be ,</l>
       <l n="90">Thy wandering child looked back to thee !</l>
       <l n="91">Heard in his dreams thy river 's sound</l>
       <l n="92">Of murmuring on its pebbly bound ,</l>
       <l n="93">The unforgotten swell and roar</l>
       <l n="94">Of waves on thy familiar shore ;</l>
       <l n="95">And saw , amidst the curtained gloom</l>
       <l n="96">And quiet of his lonely room ,</l>
       <l n="97">Thy sunset scenes before him pass ;</l>
       <l n="98">As , in Agrippa 's magic glass ,</l>
       <l n="99">The loved and lost arose to view ,</l>
       <l n="100">Remembered groves in greenness grew ,</l>
       <l n="101">Bathed still in childhood 's morning dew ,</l>
       <l n="102">Along whose bowers of beauty swept</l>
       <l n="103">Whatever Memory 's mourners wept ,</l>
       <l n="104">Sweet faces , which the charnel kept ,</l>
       <l n="105">Young , gentle eyes , which long had slept ;</l>
       <l n="106">And while the gazer leaned to trace ,</l>
       <l n="107">More near , some dear familiar face ,</l>
       <l n="108">He wept to find the vision flown ,—</l>
       <l n="109">A phantom and a dream alone !</l>

      <head>HAMPTON BEACH</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The sunlight glitters keen and bright ,</l>
       <l n="2">Where , miles away ,</l>
       <l n="3">Lies stretching to my dazzled sight</l>
       <l n="4">A luminous belt , a misty light ,</l>
       <l n="5">Beyond the dark pine bluffs and wastes of sandy gray .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="6">The tremulous shadow of the Sea !</l>
       <l n="7">Against its ground</l>
       <l n="8">Of silvery light , rock , hill , and tree ,</l>
       <l n="9">Still as a picture , clear and free ,</l>
       <l n="10">With varying outline mark the coast for miles around .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="11">On — on — we tread with loose-flung rein</l>
       <l n="12">Our seaward way ,</l>
       <l n="13">Through dark-green fields and blossoming grain ,</l>
       <l n="14">Where the wild brier-rose skirts the lane ,</l>
       <l n="15">And bends above our heads the flowering locust spray .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="16">Ha ! like a kind hand on my brow</l>
       <l n="17">Comes this fresh breeze ,</l>
       <l n="18">Cooling its dull and feverish glow ,</l>
       <l n="19">While through my being seems to flow</l>
       <l n="20">The breath of a new life , the healing of the seas !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="21">Now rest we , where this grassy mound</l>
       <l n="22">His feet hath set</l>
       <l n="23">In the great waters , which have bound</l>
       <l n="24">His granite ankles greenly round</l>
       <l n="25">With long and tangled moss , and weeds with cool spray wet .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="26">Good-by to Pain and Care ! I take</l>
       <l n="27">Mine ease to-day</l>
       <l n="28">Here where these sunny waters break ,</l>
       <l n="29">And ripples this keen breeze , I shake</l>
       <l n="30">All burdens from the heart , all weary thoughts away .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="31">I draw a freer breath , I seem</l>
       <l n="32">Like all I see —</l>
       <l n="33">Waves in the sun , the white-winged gleam</l>
       <l n="34">Of sea-birds in the slanting beam ,</l>
       <l n="35">And far-off sails which flit before the south-wind free .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="36">So when Time 's veil shall fall asunder ,</l>
       <l n="37">The soul may know</l>
       <l n="38">No fearful change , nor sudden wonder ,</l>
       <l n="39">Nor sink the weight of mystery under ,</l>
       <l n="40">But with the upward rise , and with the vastness grow .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="41">And all we shrink from now may seem</l>
       <l n="42">No new revealing ;</l>
       <l n="43">Familiar as our childhood 's stream ,</l>
       <l n="44">Or pleasant memory of a dream</l>
       <l n="45">The loved and cherished Past upon the new life stealing .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="46">Serene and mild the untried light</l>
       <l n="47">May have its dawning ;</l>
       <l n="48">And , as in summer 's northern night</l>
       <l n="49">The evening and the dawn unite ,</l>
       <l n="50">The sunset hues of Time blend with the soul 's new morning .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="51">I sit alone ; in foam and spray</l>
       <l n="52">Wave after wave</l>
       <l n="53">Breaks on the rocks which , stern and gray ,</l>
       <l n="54">Shoulder the broken tide away ,</l>
       <l n="55">Or murmurs hoarse and strong through mossy cleft and cave .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="56">What heed I of the dusty land</l>
       <l n="57">And noisy town ?</l>
       <l n="58">I see the mighty deep expand</l>
       <l n="59">From its white line of glimmering sand</l>
       <l n="60">To where the blue of heaven on bluer waves shuts down !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="61">In listless quietude of mind ,</l>
       <l n="62">I yield to all</l>
       <l n="63">The change of cloud and wave and wind</l>
       <l n="64">And passive on the flood reclined ,</l>
       <l n="65">I wander with the waves , and with them rise and fall .</l>

        <l n="27">Between me and the hot fields of his South</l>
        <l n="28">A tremulous glow , as from a furnace-mouth ,</l>

        <l n="31">Broke as they fell , and shattered into light ;</l>
        <l n="32">Yet on my cheek I feel the western wind ,</l>
        <l n="33">And hear it telling to the orchard trees ,</l>
        <l n="34">And to the faint and flower-forsaken bees ,</l>
        <l n="35">Tales of fair meadows , green with constant streams ,</l>
        <l n="36">And mountains rising blue and cool behind ,</l>
        <l n="37">Where in moist dells the purple orchis gleams ,</l>
        <l n="38">And starred with white the virgin 's bower is twined .</l>
        <l n="39">So the o'erwearied pilgrim , as he fares</l>
        <l n="40">Along life 's summer waste , at times is fanned ,</l>
        <l n="41">Even at noontide , by the cool , sweet airs</l>
        <l n="42">Of a serener and a holier land ,</l>
        <l n="43">Fresh as the morn , and as the dewfall bland .</l>
        <l n="44">Breath of the blessed Heaven for which we pray ,</l>
        <l n="45">Blow from the eternal hills ! make glad our earthly way !</l>

      <head>The trailing arbutus , or mayflower , grows abundantly in the vicinity of Plymouth , and was the first flower that greeted the Pilgrims after their fearful winter . The name mayflower was familiar in England , as the application of it to the historic vessel shows , but it was applied by the English , and still is , to the hawthorn . Its use in New England in connection with Epigma repens dates from a very early day , some claiming that the first Pilgrims so used it , in affectionate memory of the vessel and its English flower association .</head>

     <p>THE LAST WALK IN AUTUMN .</p>
     <p>I. O'er the bare woods , whose outstretched hands Plead with the leaden heavens in vain , I see , beyond the valley lands , The sea 's long level dim with rain . Around me all things , stark and dumb , Seem praying for the snows to come , And , for the summer bloom and greenness gone , With winter 's sunset lights and dazzling morn atone .</p>
     <p>II . Along the river 's summer walk , The withered tufts of asters nod ; And trembles on its arid stalk The boar plume of the golden-rod . And on a ground of sombre fir , And azure-studded juniper , The silver birch its buds of purple shows , And scarlet berries tell where bloomed the sweet wild-rose !</p>
     <p>III . With mingled sound of horns and bells , A far-heard clang , the wild geese fly , Storm-sent , from Arctic moors and fells , Like a great arrow through the sky , Two dusky lines converged in one , Chasing the southward-flying sun ; While the brave snow-bird and the hardy jay Call to them from the pines , as if to bid them stay .</p>
     <p>IV . I passed this way a year ago The wind blew south ; the noon of day Was warm as June 's ; and save that snow Flecked the low mountains far away , And that the vernal-seeming breeze Mocked faded grass and leafless trees , I might have dreamed of summer as I lay , Watching the fallen leaves with the soft wind at play .</p>
     <p>V. Since then , the winter blasts have piled The white pagodas of the snow On these rough slopes , and , strong and wild , Yon river , in its overflow Of spring-time rain and sun , set free , Crashed with its ices to the sea ; And over these gray fields , then green and gold , The summer corn has waved , the thunder 's organ rolled .</p>
     <p>VI . Rich gift of God ! A year of time What pomp of rise and shut of day , What hues wherewith our Northern clime Makes autumn 's dropping woodlands gay , What airs outblown from ferny dells , And clover-bloom and sweetbrier smells , What songs of brooks and birds , what fruits and flowers , Green woods and moonlit snows , have in its round been ours !</p>
     <p>VII . I know not how , in other lands , The changing seasons come and go ; What splendors fall on Syrian sands , What purple lights on Alpine snow ! Nor how the pomp of sunrise waits On Venice at her watery gates ; A dream alone to me is Arno 's vale , And the Alhambra 's halls are but a traveller 's tale .</p>
     <p>VIII . Yet , on life 's current , he who drifts Is one with him who rows or sails And he who wanders widest lifts No more of beauty 's jealous veils Than he who from his doorway sees The miracle of flowers and trees , Feels the warm Orient in the noonday air , And from cloud minarets hears the sunset call to prayer !</p>
     <p>IX . The eye may well be glad that looks Where Pharpar 's fountains rise and fall ; But he who sees his native brooks Laugh in the sun , has seen them all . The marble palaces of Ind Rise round him in the snow and wind ; From his lone sweetbrier Persian Hafiz smiles , And Rome 's cathedral awe is in his woodland aisles .</p>
     <p>X . And thus it is my fancy blends The near at hand and far and rare ; And while the same horizon bends Above the silver-sprinkled hair Which flashed the light of morning skies On childhood 's wonder-lifted eyes , Within its round of sea and sky and field , Earth wheels with all her zones , the Kosmos stands revealed .</p>
     <p>XI . And thus the sick man on his bed , The toiler to his task-work bound , Behold their prison-walls outspread , Their clipped horizon widen round ! While freedom-giving fancy waits , Like Peter 's angel at the gates , The power is theirs to baffle care and pain , To bring the lost world back , and make it theirs again !</p>
     <p>XII . What lack of goodly company , When masters of the ancient lyre Obey my call , and trace for me Their words of mingled tears and fire ! I talk with Bacon , grave and wise , I read the world with Pascal 's eyes ; And priest and sage , with solemn brows austere , And poets , garland-bound , the Lords of Thought , draw near .</p>
     <p>XIII . Methinks , O friend , I hear thee say , “ In vain the human heart we mock ; Bring living guests who love the day , Not ghosts who fly at crow of cock ! The herbs we share with flesh and blood Are better than ambrosial food With laurelled shades . ” I grant it , nothing loath , But doubly blest is he who can partake of both .</p>
     <p>XIV . He who might Plato 's banquet grace , Have I not seen before me sit , And watched his puritanic face , With more than Eastern wisdom lit ? Shrewd mystic ! who , upon the back Of his Poor Richard 's Almanac , Writing the Sufi 's song , the Gentoo 's dream , Links Manu 's age of thought to Fulton 's age of steam !</p>
     <p>XV . Here too , of answering love secure , Have I not welcomed to my hearth The gentle pilgrim troubadour , Whose songs have girdled half the earth ; Whose pages , like the magic mat Whereon the Eastern lover sat , Have borne me over Rhine-land 's purple vines , And Nubia 's tawny sands , and Phrygia 's mountain pines !</p>
     <p>XVI . And he , who to the lettered wealth Of ages adds the lore unpriced , The wisdom and the moral health , The ethics of the school of Christ ; The statesman to his holy trust , As the Athenian archon , just , Struck down , exiled like him for truth alone , Has he not graced my home with beauty all his own ?</p>
     <p>XVII . What greetings smile , what farewells wave , What loved ones enter and depart ! The good , the beautiful , the brave , The Heaven-lent treasures of the heart ! How conscious seems the frozen sod And beechen slope whereon they trod The oak-leaves rustle , and the dry grass bends Beneath the shadowy feet of lost or absent friends .</p>
     <p>XVIII . Then ask not why to these bleak hills I cling , as clings the tufted moss , To bear the winter 's lingering chills , The mocking spring 's perpetual loss . I dream of lands where summer smiles , And soft winds blow from spicy isles , But scarce would Ceylon 's breath of flowers be sweet , Could I not feel thy soil , New England , at my feet !</p>
     <p>XIX . At times I long for gentler skies , And bathe in dreams of softer air , But homesick tears would fill the eyes That saw the Cross without the Bear . The pine must whisper to the palm , The north-wind break the tropic calm ; And with the dreamy languor of the Line , The North 's keen virtue blend , and strength to beauty join .</p>
     <p>XX . Better to stem with heart and hand The roaring tide of life , than lie , Unmindful , on its flowery strand , Of God 's occasions drifting by Better with naked nerve to bear The needles of this goading air , Than , in the lap of sensual ease , forego The godlike power to do , the godlike aim to know .</p>
     <p>XXI . Home of my heart ! to me more fair Than gay Versailles or Windsor 's halls , The painted , shingly town-house where The freeman 's vote for Freedom falls ! The simple roof where prayer is made , Than Gothic groin and colonnade ; The living temple of the heart of man , Than Rome 's sky-mocking vault , or many-spired Milan !</p>
     <p>XXII . More dear thy equal village schools , Where rich and poor the Bible read , Than classic halls where Priestcraft rules , And Learning wears the chains of Creed ; Thy glad Thanksgiving , gathering in The scattered sheaves of home and kin , Than the mad license ushering Lenten pains , Or holidays of slaves who laugh and dance in chains .</p>
     <p>XXIII . And sweet homes nestle in these dales , And perch along these wooded swells ; And , blest beyond Arcadian vales , They hear the sound of Sabbath bells ! Here dwells no perfect man sublime , Nor woman winged before her time , But with the faults and follies of the race , Old home-bred virtues hold their not unhonored place .</p>
     <p>XXIV . Here manhood struggles for the sake Of mother , sister , daughter , wife , The graces and the loves which make The music of the march of life ; And woman , in her daily round Of duty , walks on holy ground . No unpaid menial tills the soil , nor here Is the bad lesson learned at human rights to sneer .</p>
     <p>XXV . Then let the icy north-wind blow The trumpets of the coming storm , To arrowy sleet and blinding snow Yon slanting lines of rain transform . Young hearts shall hail the drifted cold , As gayly as I did of old ; And I , who watch them through the frosty pane , Unenvious , live in them my boyhood o'er again .</p>
     <p>XXVI . And I will trust that He who heeds The life that hides in mead and wold , Who hangs yon alder 's crimson beads , And stains these mosses green and gold , Will still , as He hath done , incline His gracious care to me and mine ; Grant what we ask aright , from wrong debar , And , as the earth grows dark , make brighter every star !</p>
     <p>XXVII . I have not seen , I may not see , My hopes for man take form in fact , But God will give the victory In due time ; in that faith I act . And lie who sees the future sure , The baffling present may endure , And bless , meanwhile , the unseen Hand that leads The heart 's desires beyond the halting step of deeds .</p>
     <p>XXVIII . And thou , my song , I send thee forth , Where harsher songs of mine have flown ; Go , find a place at home and hearth Where'er thy singer 's name is known ; Revive for him the kindly thought Of friends ; and they who love him not , Touched by some strain of thine , perchance may take The hand he proffers all , and thank him for thy sake .</p>

     <p>SNOW-BOUND . A WINTER IDYL .</p>
     <p>TO THE MEMORY</p>
     <p>OF</p>
     <p>THE HOUSEHOLD IT DESCRIBES ,</p>
     <p>THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR .</p>
     <p>The inmates of the family at the Whittier homestead who are referred to in the poem were my father , mother , my brother and two sisters , and my uncle and aunt both unmarried . In addition , there was the district school-master who boarded with us . The “ not unfeared , half-welcome guest ” was Harriet Livermore , daughter of Judge Livermore , of New Hampshire , a young woman of fine natural ability , enthusiastic , eccentric , with slight control over her violent temper , which sometimes made her religious profession doubtful . She was equally ready to exhort in school-house prayer-meetings and dance in a Washington ball-room , while her father was a member of Congress . She early embraced the doctrine of the Second Advent , and felt it her duty to proclaim the Lord 's speedy coming . With this message she crossed the Atlantic and spent the greater part of a long life in travelling over Europe and Asia . She lived some time with Lady Hester Stanhope , a woman as fantastic and mentally strained as herself , on the slope of Mt . Lebanon , but finally quarrelled with her in regard to two white horses with red marks on their backs which suggested the idea of saddles , on which her titled hostess expected to ride into Jerusalem with the Lord . A friend of mine found her , when quite an old woman , wandering in Syria with a tribe of Arabs , who with the Oriental notion that madness is inspiration , accepted her as their prophetess and leader . At the time referred to in Snow-Bound she was boarding at the Rocks Village about two miles from us .</p>
     <p>In my boyhood , in our lonely farm-house , we had scanty sources of information ; few books and only a small weekly newspaper . Our only annual was the Almanac . Under such circumstances story-telling was a necessary resource in the long winter evenings . My father when a young man had traversed the wilderness to Canada , and could tell us of his adventures with Indians and wild beasts , and of his sojourn in the French villages . My uncle was ready with his record of hunting and fishing and , it must be confessed , with stories which he at least half believed , of witchcraft and apparitions . My mother , who was born in the Indian-haunted region of Somersworth , New Hampshire , between Dover and Portsmouth , told us of the inroads of the savages , and the narrow escape of her ancestors . She described strange people who lived on the Piscataqua and Cocheco , among whom was Bantam the sorcerer . I have in my possession the wizard 's “ conjuring book , ” which he solemnly opened when consulted . It is a copy of Cornelius Agrippa 's Magic printed in 1651 , dedicated to Dr. Robert Child , who , like Michael Scott , had learned “ the art of glammorie In Padua beyond the sea , ” and who is famous in the annals of Massachusetts , where he was at one time a resident , as the first man who dared petition the General Court for liberty of conscience . The full title of the book is Three Books of Occult Philosophy , by Henry Cornelius Agrippa , Knight , Doctor of both Laws , Counsellor to Caesar 's Sacred Majesty and Judge of the Prerogative Court .</p>
     <p>“ As the Spirits of Darkness be stronger in the dark , so Good Spirits , which be Angels of Light , are augmented not only by the Divine light of the Sun , but also by our common Wood Fire : and as the Celestial Fire drives away dark spirits , so also this our Fire of Wood doth the same . ” — Cor . AGRIPPA , Occult Philosophy , Book I. ch . v .</p>

       <l n="45">As zigzag , wavering to and fro ,</l>
       <l n="46">Crossed and recrossed the winged snow</l>
       <l n="47">And ere the early bedtime came</l>
       <l n="48">The white drift piled the window-frame ,</l>

      <head>THE FAMILIST 'S HYMN .</head>
      <head>The Puritans of New England , even in their wilderness home , were not exempted from the sectarian contentions which agitated the mother country after the downfall of Charles the First , and of the established Episcopacy . The Quakers , Baptists , and Catholics were banished , on pain of death , from the Massachusetts Colony . One Samuel Gorton , a bold and eloquent declaimer , after preaching for a time in Boston against the doctrines of the Puritans , and declaring that their churches were mere human devices , and their sacrament and baptism an abomination , was driven out of the jurisdiction of the colony , and compelled to seek a residence among the savages . He gathered round him a considerable number of converts , who , like the primitive Christians , shared all things in common . His opinions , however , were so troublesome to the leading clergy of the colony , that they instigated an attack upon his “ Family ” by an armed force , which seized upon the principal men in it , and brought them into Massachusetts , where they were sentenced to be kept at hard labor in several towns ( one only in each town ) , during the pleasure of the General Court , they being forbidden , under severe penalties , to utter any of their religious sentiments , except to such ministers as might labor for their conversion . They were unquestionably sincere in their opinions , and , whatever may have been their errors , deserve to be ranked among those who have in all ages suffered for the freedom of conscience .</head>

      <head>THE SHADOW AND THE LIGHT .</head>
      <head>“ And I sought , whence is Evil : I set before the eye of my spirit the whole creation ; whatsoever we see therein ,— sea , earth , air , stars , trees , moral creatures ,— yea , whatsoever there is we do not see ,— angels and spiritual powers . Where is evil , and whence comes it , since God the Good hath created all things ? Why made He anything at all of evil , and not rather by His Almightiness cause it not to be ? These thoughts I turned in my miserable heart , overcharged with most gnawing cares . ” “ And , admonished to return to myself , I entered even into my inmost soul , Thou being my guide , and beheld even beyond my soul and mind the Light unchangeable . He who knows the Truth knows what that Light is , and he that knows it knows Eternity ! O — Truth , who art Eternity ! Love , who art Truth ! Eternity , who art Love ! And I beheld that Thou madest all things good , and to Thee is nothing whatsoever evil . From the angel to the worm , from the first motion to the last , Thou settest each in its place , and everything is good in its kind . Woe is me !— how high art Thou in the highest , how deep in the deepest ! and Thou never departest from us and we scarcely return to Thee . ” — AUGUSTINE 'S Soliloquies , Book VII .</head>

      <head>THE PRAYER OF AGASSIZ .</head>
      <head>The island of Penikese in Buzzard 's Bay was given by Mr. John Anderson to Agassiz for the uses of a summer school of natural history . A large barn was cleared and improvised as a lecture-room . Here , on the first morning of the school , all the company was gathered . “ Agassiz had arranged no programme of exercises , ” says Mrs. Agassiz , in Louis Agassiz ; his Life and Correspondence , “ trusting to the interest of the occasion to suggest what might best be said or done . But , as he looked upon his pupils gathered there to study nature with him , by an impulse as natural as it was unpremeditated , he called upon then to join in silently asking God 's blessing on their work together . The pause was broken by the first words of an address no less fervent than its unspoken prelude . ” This was in the summer of 1873 , and Agassiz died the December following .</head>

       <l n="2">On the great waters of the unsounded sea ,</l>
       <l n="3">Momently listening with suspended oar</l>
       <l n="4">For the low rote of waves upon a shore</l>
       <l n="5">Changeless as heaven , where never fog-cloud drifts</l>
       <l n="6">Over its windless wood , nor mirage lifts</l>
       <l n="7">The steadfast hills ; where never birds of doubt</l>
       <l n="8">Sing to mislead , and every dream dies out ,</l>
       <l n="9">And the dark riddles which perplex us here</l>
       <l n="10">In the sharp solvent of its light are clear ?</l>
       <l n="11">Thou knowest how vain our quest ; how , soon or late ,</l>

       <l n="15">And round about us seeing , with sad eyes ,</l>
       <l n="16">The same old difficult hills and cloud-cold skies ,</l>
       <l n="17">We said : “ This outward search availeth not</l>
       <l n="18">To find Him . He is farther than we thought ,</l>
       <l n="19">Or , haply , nearer . To this very spot</l>
       <l n="20">Whereon we wait , this commonplace of home ,</l>
       <l n="21">As to the well of Jacob , He may come</l>
       <l n="22">And tell us all things . ” As I listened there ,</l>
       <l n="23">Through the expectant silences of prayer ,</l>
       <l n="24">Somewhat I seemed to hear , which hath to me</l>

     <p>A CHRISTMAS CARMEN .</p>
     <p>I . Sound over all waters , reach out from all lands , The chorus of voices , the clasping of hands ; Sing hymns that were sung by the stars of the morn , Sing songs of the angels when Jesus was born ! With glad jubilations Bring hope to the nations The dark night is ending and dawn has begun Rise , hope of the ages , arise like the sun , All speech flow to music , all hearts beat as one !</p>
     <p>II . Sing the bridal of nations ! with chorals of love Sing out the war-vulture and sing in the dove , Till the hearts of the peoples keep time in accord , And the voice of the world is the voice of the Lord ! Clasp hands of the nations In strong gratulations : The dark night is ending and dawn has begun ; Rise , hope of the ages , arise like the sun , All speech flow to music , all hearts beat as one !</p>
     <p>III . Blow , bugles of battle , the marches of peace ; East , west , north , and south let the long quarrel cease Sing the song of great joy that the angels began , Sing of glory to God and of good-will to man ! Hark ! joining in chorus The heavens bend o'er us ’ The dark night is ending and dawn has begun ; Rise , hope of the ages , arise like the sun , All speech flow to music , all hearts beat as one ! 1873 .</p>

       <l n="1">The tree of Faith its bare , dry boughs must shed</l>

       <l n="8">Troubling with life the waters of the world .</l>
       <l n="9">Even as they list the winds of the Spirit blow</l>

       <l n="19">No gain is lost ; the clear-eyed saints look down</l>

       <l n="22">Counting in task-field and o'erpeopled town ;</l>
       <l n="23">Truth has charmed life ; the Inward Word survives ,</l>
       <l n="24">And , day by day , its revelation brings ;</l>
       <l n="25">Faith , hope , and charity , whatsoever things</l>

     <p>HYMNS OF THE BRAHMO SOMAJ .</p>
     <p>I have attempted this paraphrase of the Hymns of the Brahmo Somaj of India , as I find them in Mozoomdar 's account of the devotional exercises of that remarkable religious development which has attracted far less attention and sympathy from the Christian world than it deserves , as a fresh revelation of the direct action of the Divine Spirit upon the human heart .</p>
     <p>I . The mercy , O Eternal One ! By man unmeasured yet , In joy or grief , in shade or sun , I never will forget . I give the whole , and not a part , Of all Thou gayest me ; My goods , my life , my soul and heart , I yield them all to Thee !</p>
     <p>II . We fast and plead , we weep and pray , From morning until even ; We feel to find the holy way , We knock at the gate of heaven And when in silent awe we wait , And word and sign forbear , The hinges of the golden gate Move , soundless , to our prayer ! Who hears the eternal harmonies Can heed no outward word ; Blind to all else is he who sees The vision of the Lord !</p>
     <p>III . O soul , be patient , restrain thy tears , Have hope , and not despair ; As a tender mother heareth her child God hears the penitent prayer . And not forever shall grief be thine ; On the Heavenly Mother 's breast , Washed clean and white in the waters of joy Shall His seeking child find rest . Console thyself with His word of grace , And cease thy wail of woe , For His mercy never an equal hath , And His love no bounds can know . Lean close unto Him in faith and hope ; How many like thee have found In Him a shelter and home of peace , By His mercy compassed round ! There , safe from sin and the sorrow it brings , They sing their grateful psalms , And rest , at noon , by the wells of God , In the shade of His holy palms !</p>

      <head>REVELATION .</head>
      <head>“ And I went into the Vale of Beavor , and as I went I preached repentance to the people . And one morning , sitting by the fire , a great cloud came over me , and a temptation beset me . And it was said : All things come by Nature ; and the Elements and the Stars came over me . And as I sat still and let it alone , a living hope arose in me , and a true Voice which said : There is a living God who made all things . And immediately the cloud and the temptation vanished , and Life rose over all , and my heart was glad and I praised the Living God . ” — Journal of George Fox , 1690 .</head>
