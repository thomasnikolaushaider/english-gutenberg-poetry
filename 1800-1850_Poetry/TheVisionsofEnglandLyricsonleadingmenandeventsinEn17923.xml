    <head>INTRODUCTION .</head>
    <p n="1">Again , on behalf of readers of this NATIONAL LIBRARY , I have to thank a poet of our day — in this case the Oxford Professor of Poetry — for joining his voice to the voices of the past through which our better life is quickened for the duties of to-day . Not for his own verse only , but for his fine sense also of what is truest in the poets who have gone before , the name of Francis Turner Palgrave is familiar to us all . Many a home has been made the richer for his gathering of voices of the past into a dainty “ Golden Treasury of English Songs . ” Of this work of his own I may cite what was said of it in Macmillan 's Magazine for October , 1882 , by a writer of high authority in English Literature , Professor A. W. Ward , of Owens College . “ A very eminent authority , ” said Professor Ward , “ has accorded to Mr. Palgrave 's historical insight , praise by the side of which all words of mine must be valueless , ” Canon [ now Bishop ] Stubbs writes :— “ I do not think that there is one of the Visions which does not carry my thorough consent and sympathy all through . ”</p>
    <p n="2">Here , then , Mr. Palgrave re-issues , for the help of many thousands more , his own songs of the memories of the Nation , addressed to a Nation that has not yet forfeited the praise of Milton . Milton said of the Englishman , “ If we look at his native towardliness in the roughcast , without breeding , some nation or other may haply be better composed to a natural civility and right judgment than he . But if he get the benefit once of a wise and well-rectified nurture , I suppose that wherever mention is made of countries , manners , or men , the English people , among the first that shall be praised , may deserve to be accounted a right pious , right honest , and right hardy nation . ” So much is shown by the various utterances in this NATIONAL LIBRARY . So much is shown , in the present volume of it , by a poet 's vision of the England that has been till now , and is what she has been .</p>
    <p n="3">H. M .</p>
    <p n="4">TO THE NAMES OF HENRY HALLAM AND FRANCIS PALGRAVE FRIENDS AND FELLOW-LABOURERS IN ENGLISH HISTORY FOR FORTY YEARS , WHO , DIFFERING OFTEN IN JUDGMENT , WERE AT ONE THROUGHOUT LIFE IN DEVOTED LOVE OF JUSTICE , TRUTH , AND ENGLAND , IN AFFECTIONATE AND REVERENT REMEMBRANCE THIS BOOK IS INSCRIBED AND DEDICATED</p>

   <div type="preface">
    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="5">As the scheme which the Author has here endeavoured to execute has not , so far as he knows , the advantage of any near precedent in any literature , he hopes that a few explanatory words may be offered without incurring censure for egotism .</p>
    <p n="6">Our history is so eminently rich and varied , and at the same time , by the fact of our insular position , so stamped with unity , that from days very remote it has supplied matter for song . This , among Celts and Angles , at first was lyrical . But poetry , for many centuries after the Conquest , mainly took the annalistic form , and , despite the ability often shown , was hence predoomed to failure . For a nation 's history cannot but present many dull or confused periods , many men and things intractable by poetry , though , perhaps , politically effective and important , which cannot be excluded from any narrative aiming at consecutiveness ; and , by the natural laws of art , these passages , when rendered in verse , in their effect become more prosaic than they would be in a prose rendering .</p>
    <p n="7">My attempt has therefore been to revert to the earlier and more natural conditions of poetry , and to offer ,— not a continuous narrative ; not poems on every critical moment or conspicuous man in our long annals ,— but single lyrical pictures of such leading or typical characters and scenes in English history , and only such , as have seemed amenable to a strictly poetical treatment . Poetry , not History , has , hence , been my first and last aim ; or , perhaps I might define it , History for Poetry 's sake . At the same time , I have striven to keep throughout as closely to absolute historical truth in the design and colouring of the pieces as the exigencies of poetry permit :— the result aimed at being to unite the actual tone and spirit of the time concerned , with the best estimate which has been reached by the research and genius of modern investigators . Our island story , freed from the ‘ falsehood of extremes , ’ — exorcised , above all , from the seducing demon of party-spirit , I have thus here done my best to set forth . And as this line of endeavour has conducted and constrained me , especially when the seventeenth century is concerned , to judgments — supported indeed by historians conspicuous for research , ability , and fairness , but often remote from the views popularized by the writers of our own day ,— upon these points a few justificatory notes have been added .</p>
    <p n="8">A double aim has hence governed and limited both the selection and the treatment of my subjects . The choice has necessarily fallen , often , not on simply picturesque incident or unfamiliar character , but on the men and things that we think of first , when thinking of the long chronicle of England ,— or upon such as represent and symbolize the main current of it . Themes , however , on which able or popular song is already extant ,— notably in case of Scotland ,— I have in general avoided . In the rendering , my desire has been always to rest the poetry of each Vision on its own intrinsic interest ; to write with a straightforward eye to the object alone ; not studious of ornament for ornament 's sake ; allowing the least possible overt intrusion of the writer 's personality ; and , in accordance with lyrical law , seeking , as a rule , to fix upon some factual picture for each poem .</p>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>To define , thus , the scope of what this book attempts , is , in itself , a confession of presumptuousness ,— the writer 's own sense of which is but feebly and imperfectly expressed in the words from Vergil 's letter to Augustus prefixed as my motto . In truth , so rich and so wide are the materials , that to scheme a lyrical series which should really paint the Gesta Anglorum in their fulness might almost argue ‘ lack of wit , ’ vitium mentis , in much greater powers than mine . No criticism , however severe , can add to my own consciousness how far the execution of the work , in regard to each of its aims , falls below the plan . Yet I would allow myself the hope , great as the deficiencies may be , that the love of truth and the love of England are mine by inheritance in a degree sufficient to exempt this book , ( the labour of several years ) , from infidelity to either :— that the intrinsic worth and weight of my subject may commend these songs , both at home , and in the many Englands beyond sea , to those who , ( despite the inevitably more engrossing attractions of the Present , and the emphatic bias of modern culture towards the immediate and the tangible ) , maintain that high and soul-inspiring interest which , identifying us with our magnificent Past , and all its varied lessons of defeat and victory , offers at the same time ,— under the guidance from above ,— our sole secure guarantee for prosperous and healthy progress in the Future .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The world has cycles in its course , when all</l>
     <l n="2">That once has been , is acted o'er again ;</l>
   </lg>
   <p>and only the nation which , at each moment of political or social evolution , looks lovingly backward to its own painfully-earned experience — Respiciens , Prospiciens , as Tennyson 's own chosen device expresses it — has solid reason to hope , that its movement is true Advance — that its course is Upward .</p>
   <p>It remains only to add , that the book has been carefully revised and corrected , and that nineteen pieces published in the original volume of 1881 are not reprinted in the present issue .</p>

St. 5 Tree and flower ; such are reported to have been naturalized in England by the Romans .— Northern ramparts ; that of Agricola and Lollius Urbicus from Forth to Clyde , and the greater work of Hadrian and Severus between Tyne and Solway . St. 6 , 7 The Arthurian legends ,— now revivified for us by Tennyson 's magnificent Idylls of the King ,— form the visionary links in our history between the decline of the Roman power and the earlier days of the Saxon conquest . St. 9 Villagedom ; Angles and Saxons seem at first to have burned the larger towns of the Romanized Britons and left them deserted , in favour of village-life . St. 11 Village-moot : Held on a little hill or round a sacred tree : ‘ the ealdermen spoke , groups of freemen stood round , clashing shields in applause , settling matters by loud shouts of Aye or Nay . ’ ( J. R. Green , History of the English People ) . St. 12 Balder , the God of Light , like Adonis in the old Greek story , is a nature-myth , figuring the Sun , yearly dying in winter , and yearly restored to life . St. 13 Landeyda ; Name of Danish banner : ‘ the desolation of the land . ’</p>

   <p>Belerium ; The name given to the Land 's End by Diodorus , the Greek historical compiler . He describes the natives as hospitable and civilized . They mined tin , which was bought by traders and carried through Gaul to the south-east , and may , as suggested here , have been used in their armour by the warriors during the Homeric Siege of Troy .</p>

   <p>The true dreams ; On his last night Rufus ‘ laid himself down to sleep , but not in peace ; the attendants were startled by the King 's voice — a bitter cry — a cry for help — a cry for deliverance — he had been suddenly awakened by a dreadful dream , as of exquisite anguish befalling him in that ruined church , at the foot of the Malwood rampart . ’ Palgrave : Hist . of Normandy and of England , B.

But she had always refused to take the vows , and was hence , in opposition to her aunt 's wish , declared canonically free to marry by Anselm ; called here an Italian priest , as born at Aosta .

   <p>The ‘ Thud Crusade , ’ 1189-1193 , is the subject of this poem . Richard Coeur de Lion carried his followers by way of Sicily and Cyprus : making a transient conquest of the latter . In the Holy Land the siege of Acre consumed the time and strength of the Crusaders . They suffered terribly in the wilderness of Mount Carmel , and when at last preparing to march on Jerusalem ( 1192 ) were recalled to Ascalon . Richard now advanced to Bethany , but was unable to reach the Holy City . The tale is that while riding with a party of knights one of them called out , ‘ This way , my lord , and you will see Jerusalem . ’ But Richard hid his face and said , ‘ Alas !— they who are not worthy to win the Holy City are not worthy to behold it . ’</p>
   <p>The vast Imperial dome ; The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was built by the Emperor Constantine ; A. D. 326-335 .</p>

     <l n="58">He hove his huge two-handed blade ,</l>

     <l n="65">And England wept beside him .</l>

   <p>In the words given here to Simon ( and , indeed , in the bulk of my narrative ) I have almost literally followed Prothero 's Life . The struggle , like other critical conflicts in the days of unprofessional war , was very brief .</p>

   <p>Where a king ; The war in which Llywelyn fell was the inevitable result of the growing power of England under Edward I ; and , considering the vast preponderance of weight against the Welsh Prince it could not have ended but in the conquest of Wales . Yet its issue , as told here , was determined as if by chance .</p>
   <p>Aberffraw ; in Anglesea : the residence of the royal line of Gywnedd from the time of Rhodri Mawr onwards .</p>
   <p>Eryri ; the Eagle 's rock is a name for Snowdon . The bird has been seen in the neighbourhood within late years .</p>
   <p>Is it she ; Eleanor , daughter to Simon de Montfort . After some years of betrothal and impediment arising from the jealousy of Edward I , she and Llywelyn were married in 1278 . But after only two years of happiness , Eleanor died , leaving one child , Catharine or Gwenllian .</p>
   <p>Maesmynan ; by Caerwys in Flintshire ; where Llywelyn lived retiredly in youth .</p>
   <p>The thousand-years ’ kingdom ; The descent of the royal house of North Wales is legendarily traced from Caradoc-Caractacus . But the accepted genealogy of the Princes of Gwynedd begins with Cunedda Wledig ( Paramount ) cir . 400 : ending in 1282 with Llywelyn son of Gruffydd .</p>
   <p>The scorn-diadem 'd head ; On finding whom he had slain , Frankton carried Llywelyn 's head to Edward at Rhuddlan , who , with a barbarity unworthy of himself , set it over the Tower of London , wreathed in mockery of a prediction ( ascribed to Merlin ) upon the coronation of a Welsh Prince in London .</p>
   <p>Rhodri and Owain ; Rhodri Mawr , ( 843 ) , who united under his supremacy the other Welsh principalities , Powys and Dinefawr ; Owain Gwynedd , ( 1137 ) ,— are among the most conspicuous of Llywelyn 's royal predecessors .</p>

     <l n="2">So the land had rest ! and the cloud of that heart-sore struggle and pain</l>
     <l n="3">Rose from her ancient hills , and peace shone o'er her again ,</l>
     <l n="4">Sunlike chasing the plagues wherewith the land was defiled ;</l>
     <l n="5">And the leprosy fled , and her flesh came again , as the flesh of a child .</l>
     <l n="6">— They were stern and stark , the three children of Rolf , the first from</l>
     <l n="7">Anjou :</l>
     <l n="8">For their own sake loving the land , mayhap , but loving her true ;</l>
     <l n="9">France the wife , and England the handmaid ; yet over the realm</l>
     <l n="10">Their eyes were in every place , their hands gripp 'd firm on the helm .</l>
     <l n="11">Villein and earl , the cowl and the plume , they were bridled alike ;</l>
     <l n="12">One law for all , but arm 'd law ,— not swifter to aid than to strike .</l>
     <l n="13">Lo , in the twilight transept , the holy places of God ,</l>
     <l n="14">Not with sunset the steps of the altar are dyed , but with scarlet of</l>
     <l n="15">blood !</l>
     <l n="16">Clang of iron-shod feet , and sheep for their shepherd who cry ;</l>
     <l n="17">Curses and swords that flash , and the victim proffer 'd to die !</l>
     <l n="18">— Bare thy own back to the smiter , O king , at the shrine of the dead :</l>
     <l n="19">Thy friend thou hast slain in thy folly ; the blood of the Saint on thy</l>
     <l n="20">head :</l>
     <l n="21">Proud and priestly , thou say'st ;— yet tender and faithful and pure ;</l>
     <l n="22">True man , and so , true saint ;— the crown of his martyrdom sure :—</l>
     <l n="23">As friend with his friend , he could brave thee and warn ; thou hast</l>
     <l n="24">silenced the voice ,</l>
     <l n="25">Ne'er to be heard again :— nor again will Henry rejoice !</l>
     <l n="26">Green Erin may yield her , fair Scotland submit ; but his sunshine is o'er ;</l>
     <l n="27">The tooth of the serpent , the child of his bosom , has smote him so sore :—</l>
     <l n="28">Like a wolf from the hounds he dragg 'd off to his lair , not turning to</l>
     <l n="29">bay :—</l>
     <l n="30">Crying ‘ shame on a conquer 'd king ! ’ — the grim ghost fled sullen away .</l>
     <l n="31">— Then , as in gray Autumn the heavens are pour 'd on the rifted hillside ,</l>
     <l n="32">When the Rain-stars mistily gleam , and torrents leap white in their</l>
     <l n="33">pride ,</l>
     <l n="34">And the valley is all one lake , and the late , unharvested shocks</l>
     <l n="35">Are rapt to the sea , the dwellings of man , the red kine and the flocks ,—</l>
     <l n="36">O'er England the ramparts of law , the old landmarks of liberty fell ,</l>
     <l n="37">As the brothers in blood and in lust , twin horror begotten of hell ,</l>
     <l n="38">Suck 'd all the life of the land to themselves , like Lofoden in flood ,</l>
     <l n="39">One in his pride , in his subtlety one , mocking England and God .</l>
     <l n="40">Then tyranny 's draught — once only — we drank to the dregs !— and the stain</l>
     <l n="41">Went crimson and black through the soul of the land , for all time , not in</l>
     <l n="42">vain !</l>
     <l n="43">We bore the bluff many-wived king , rough rival and victor of Rome ;</l>
     <l n="44">We bore the stern despot-protector , whose dawning and sunset were gloom ;</l>
     <l n="45">For they temper 'd the self of the tyrant with love of the land ,</l>
     <l n="46">Some touch of the heart , some remorse , refraining the grip of the hand .</l>
     <l n="47">But John 's was blackness of darkness , a day of vileness and shame ;</l>
     <l n="48">Shrieks of the tortured , and silence , and outrage the mouth cannot name .</l>
     <l n="49">— O that cry of the helpless , the weak that writhe under the foe ,</l>
     <l n="50">Wrong man-wrought upon man , dumb unwritten annals of woe !</l>
     <l n="51">Cry that goes upward from earth as she rolls through the peace of the</l>
     <l n="52">skies</l>
     <l n="53">‘ How long ? Hast thou forgotten , O God ! ’ . . . and silence replies !</l>
     <l n="54">Silence :— and then was the answer ;— the light o'er Windsor that broke ,</l>
     <l n="55">The Meadow of Law — true Avalon where the true Arthur awoke !</l>
     <l n="56">— Not thou , whose name , as a seed o'er the world , plume-wafted on air ,</l>
     <l n="57">Britons on each side sea ,— Caerlleon and Cumbria ,— share ,</l>
     <l n="58">Joy of a downtrod race , dear hope of freedom to-be ,</l>
     <l n="59">Dream of poetic hearts , whom the vision only can see ! . . .</l>
     <l n="60">For thine were the fairy knights , fair ideals of beauty and song ;</l>
     <l n="61">But ours , in the ways of men , walk 'd sober , and stumbling , and strong ;—</l>
     <l n="62">Stumbling as who in peril and twilight their pathway trace out ,</l>
     <l n="63">Hard to trace , and untried , and the foe above and about ;</l>
     <l n="64">For the Charter of Freedom , the voice of the land in her Council secure</l>
     <l n="65">All doing , all daring ,— and , e'en when defeated , of victory sure !</l>

     <l n="71">A warfare of years ; and the battle raged , and new heroes arose</l>
     <l n="72">From a soil that is fertile in manhood 's men , and scatter 'd the foes ,</l>

   <p>Langland , whom I have put here in contrast with Chaucer , is said to have lived between 1332 and 1400 . His Vision of Piers the Plowman ( who is partially identified with our blessed Saviour ) , with some added poems , forms an allegory on life in England , in Church and State , as it appeared to him during the dislocated and corrupt age which followed the superficial glories of Edward the Third 's earlier years .</p>
   <p>Took the toll ; Amongst other official employments , Chaucer was Comptroller of the Customs in the Port of London . See his House of Fame ; and the beautiful picture of his walks at dawning in the daisy - meadows : Prologue to the Legend of Good Women .</p>
   <p>His of Certaldo , . . . in Scythia ; Boccaccio :— and Ovid , who died in exile at Tomi :— to both of whom Chaucer is greatly indebted for the substance of his tales .</p>
   <p>Picture-like ; ‘ It is chiefly as a comic poet , and a minute observer of manners and circumstances , that Chaucer excels . In serious and moral poetry he is frequently languid and diffuse , but he springs like Antaeus from the earth when his subject changes to coarse satire or merry narrative ’ ( Hallam , Mid . Ages : Ch . IX : Pt . iii ) .</p>
   <p>The Tabard ; Inn in Southwark whence the pilgrims to Canterbury start .</p>
   <p>Down the Strand ; It is thus that Langland describes himself and his feelings of dissatisfaction with the world .</p>
   <p>That worst woe ; Literature , even ancient literature , has no phrase more deeply felt and pathetic than the words which the Persian nobleman at the feast in Thebes before Plataea addressed to Thersander of Orchomenus :— [ Greek text ]: ( Herodotus , IX : xvi ) .</p>
   <p>One morn he lay ; The Vision opens with a picture of the poet asleep on Malvern Hill : the last of the added poems closing as he wakes with the Easter chimes .</p>
   <p>Old measures ; Langland 's metre ‘ is more uncouth than that of his predecessors ’ ( Hallam , Mid . Ag . Ch . IX : Pt . iii ) .</p>
   <p>In the Minster ; Chaucer was buried at the entrance of S. Benet 's Chapel in Westminster Abbey .</p>

In the numbers engaged , as well as in the terrible obstinacy of the struggle , no such battle had been seen in England since the field of Senlac . The two armies together numbered nearly 120 , 000 men ': ( Green , B. IV : ch . vi ) .</p>

   <p>Mary of Scotland is one of the five or six figures in our history who rouse an undying personal interest . Volumes have been and will be written on her :— yet if we put aside the distorting mists of national and political and theological partisanship , the common laws of human nature will give an easy clue to her conduct and that of her enemies .</p>
   <p>Her flight from Scotland , as the turning-point in Mary 's unhappy and pathetic career , has been here chosen for the moment whence to survey it .</p>
   <p>On Holyrood stairs ; Riccio was murdered on March 9 , 1566 . Mary 's exclamation when she heard of his death next day , No more tears ; I will think upon a revenge , is the sufficient explanation ,— in a great degree should be the sufficient justification , with those who still hold her an accomplice in the death of Darnley and the marriage with Bothwell ,— ( considering the then lawless state of Scotland , the complicity of the leading nobles , the hopelessness of justice ) — of her later conduct whilst Queen .</p>
   <p>The friend ; In Riccio 's murder the main determinant was his efficiency in aiding Mary towards a Roman Catholic reaction , which might have deprived a large body of powerful nobles of the church lands . The death of Riccio ( Mary 's most faithful friend ) prevented this : the death of Darnley became necessary to secure the position gained .</p>
   <p>A brother 's hypocrite tears ; Murray , in whose interest Riccio was murdered , and whose privity to the murder ( as afterwards to that of Darnley ) is reasonably , though indirectly , proved , affected to shed tears on seeing his sister . Next day she learned the details of the plot , and her half-brother 's share in it .</p>
   <p>The flight ; Mary then fled by a secret passage from Holyrood Palace through the Abbey Church , the royal tombs which had been broken open by the revolutionary mob of 1559 .</p>
   <p>The Castle ; Dunbar .</p>

   <p>In 1585 Elizabeth , who was then aiding the United Provinces in their resistance to Spain , sent Sir Philip Sidney ( born 1554 ) as governor of the fortress of Flushing in Zealand . The Earl of Leicester , chosen by the Queen 's unhappy partiality to command the English force , named Sidney ( his nephew ) General of the horse . He marched thence to Zutphen in Guelderland , a town besieged by the Spaniards , in hopes of destroying a strong reinforcement which they were bringing in aid of the besiegers . The details of the rash and heroic charge which followed may be read in Motley 's History of the United Netherlands , ch . ix .</p>
   <p>St. 1 Guelderland ; in this province the Rhine divides before entering the sea : ‘ gliding through a vast plain . ’ — South-Fen ; Zutphen , on the Yssel ( Rhine ) .</p>
   <p>St. 3 The bands from Epirus ; Crescia , the Epirote chief , commanded a body of Albanian cavalry .— The waning Dudley star ; Leicester , who was near the end of his miserable career .— Astrophel ; Sidney celebrated his love for Penelope Devereux , Lady Rich , in the series of Sonnets and Lyrics named Astrophel and Stella :— posthumously published in 1591 .— After , or with Shakespeare 's Sonnets , this series seems to me to offer the most powerful picture of the passion of love in the whole range of our poetry .</p>
   <p>St. 4 Saker ; early name for field-piece .— The Six Hundred ; The Crimea in ancient days was named Chersonesus Taurica .</p>
   <p>St. 5 Black Norris ; had been at variance with Sir W. Stanley before the engagement . Morris was one of twelve gallant brothers , whose complexion followed that of their mother , named by Elizabeth ‘ her own crow . ’ — North ; was lying bedrid from a wound in the leg , but could not resist volunteering at Zutphen , and rode up ‘ with one boot on and one boot off . ’ — Cuisses ;</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">I saw young Harry , with his beaver on ,</l>
     <l n="2">His cuisses on his thighs : ( Henry IV , Part I : A. iv : S. i ):—</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Sidney flung off his ‘ in a fit of chivalrous extravagance . ’ — At the joust ; In Sonnets 41 and 53 of Astrophel and Stella Sidney describes how the sudden sight of his lady-love dazzled him as he rode in certain tournaments . In Son . 69 he cries :</p>
   <p>I , I , O , I , may say that she is mine .</p>

   <p>George Herbert 's brief career as a parish priest was passed at Bemerton , a pretty village near Salisbury in the vale of the Avon . His parsonage , with its garden running down to the stream , and the little church across the road in which he lies buried , remain comparatively unchanged ( March 26 , 1880 ) since he lived and mused and wrote his Poems within these precincts . The justly-famous Temple was published shortly after his death by his friend Nicholas Ferrar .</p>

     <l n="56">And the gardens of Richmond on Thames , the fine blythe air of the vale</l>
     <l n="57">Stay not the waning pulse , and the masters of science fail .</l>
     <l n="58">Then the little footsteps are faint , and a child may take her with ease ;</l>
     <l n="59">As the flowers a babe flings down she is spread on Elizabeth 's knees ,</l>
     <l n="60">Slipping back to the cradle-life , in her wasting weakness and pain :</l>
     <l n="61">And the sister prays and smiles and watches the sister in vain .</l>

     <l n="62">So she watch 'd by the bed all night , and the lights were yellow and</l>

     <l n="64">And a cold blue blink shimmer 'd up from the park that was sheeted in</l>

     <l n="67">The Sarsar-wind of the dawn , crept into the palace , and sigh 'd .</l>
     <l n="68">And the child just turn 'd her head towards Elizabeth there as she lay ,</l>
     <l n="69">And her little hands came together in haste , as though she would pray ;</l>
     <l n="70">And the words wrestled in her for speech that the fever-dry mouth cannot</l>
     <l n="71">frame ,</l>
     <l n="72">And the strife of the soul on the delicate brow was written in flame :</l>
     <l n="73">And Elizabeth call 'd ‘ O Father , why does she look at me so ?</l>
     <l n="74">Will it soon be better for Anne ? her face is all in a glow ':—</l>
     <l n="75">But with womanly speed and heed is the mother beside her , and slips</l>
     <l n="76">Her arm ‘ neath the failing head , and moistens the rose of the lips ,</l>
     <l n="77">Pale and sweet as the wild rose of June , and whispers to pray</l>
     <l n="78">To the Father in heaven , ‘ the one she likes best , my baby , to say ':</l>
     <l n="79">And the soul hover 'd yet o'er the lips , as a dove when her pinions are</l>
     <l n="80">spread ,</l>
     <l n="81">And the light of the after-life came again in her eyes , and she said ;</l>
     <l n="82">‘ For my long prayer it is not time ; for my short one I think I have</l>
     <l n="83">breath ;</l>
     <l n="84">Lighten mine eyes , O Lord , that I sleep not the sleep of death . ’</l>
     <l n="85">— O ! into life , fair child , as she pray 'd , her innocence slept !</l>
     <l n="86">‘ It is better for her , ’ they said :— and knelt , and kiss 'd her , and wept .</l>

     <l n="87">In her ; Henrietta 's mother was by birth Mary de ’ Medici ; the</l>

   <p>‘ With Charles I , ’ says Ranke , ‘ nothing was more seductive than secrecy . The contradictions in his conduct entangled him in embarrassments , in which his declarations , if always true in the sense he privately gave them , were only a hair'shYpppHeNbreadth removed from actual , and even from intentional , untruth . ’ — Whether traceable to descent , or to the evil influence of Buckingham and the intriguing atmosphere of the Spanish marriage-negotiations , this defect in political honesty is , unquestionably , the one serious blot on the character of Charles I .— Yet , whilst noting it , candid students will regretfully confess that the career of Elizabeth and her counsellors is defaced by shades of bad faith , darker and more numerous .</p>
   <p>When the kingdom ; See Clarendon 's description of England during this period , ‘ enjoying the greatest calm and the fullest measure of felicity that any people in any age for so long time together have been blessed with . ’</p>
   <p>Three golden heads ; Mary , the second child of Charles and Henrietta , was born Nov. 4 , 1631 : Elizabeth , Dec. 28 , 1635 : Anne , Mar . 17 , 1637 . The last two were feeble from infancy . Consumption soon showed itself in Anne , and her short life , passed at Richmond , closed in November , 1640 . For her last words , we are indebted to Fuller , who adds : ‘ This done , the little lamb gave up the ghost . ’</p>
   <p>The affection and care of the royal parents is well attested . ‘ Their arrival , ’ when visiting the nursery , ‘ was the signal of a general rejoicing . ’</p>
   <p>In the latter portion of this piece I have ventured , it will be seen , on an ideal treatment . The main facts , and the words of the dear child , are historical :— for the details I appeal to any mother who has suffered similar loss whether they could have been much otherwise .</p>
   <p>Not seeing ; See the Captive Child .</p>
   <p>The frost ; It is noticed that death , the Sarsar-wind of Southey 's Thalaba , often occurs at the turn between night and day , when the atmosphere is wont to be at the coldest .</p>

   <p>John Hampden met his death at Chalgrove in an attempt to check the raids which Prince Rupert was making from Oxford . Struck at the onset in the shoulder by two carabine balls , he rode off before the action was ended by Hazeley towards Thame , finding it impossible to reach Pyrton , the home of his father-in-law . The body was carried to his own house amid the woods and hills of the Chiltern country , and buried in the church close by .</p>
   <p>With his face downward ; This was the dying request of some high-minded Spaniard of old , unwilling , even in the grave , as it were , to look on the misfortunes of his country .</p>
   <p>O'erstrode the bounds ; ‘ After every allowance has been made , ’ says Hallam , speaking of the Long Parliament from a date so early as August , 1641 , ‘ he must bring very heated passions to the records of those times , who does not perceive in the conduct of that body a series of glaring violations , not only of positive and constitutional , but of those higher principles which are paramount to all immediate policy ': ( Const . Hist . ch . ix ) .</p>
   <p>The axe ; A clear and impartial sketch of Stafford 's trial will be found in Ranke ( B. viii ): who deals dispassionately and historically with an event much obscured by declamation in popular narratives . Even in Hallam 's hand the balance seems here to waver a little .</p>

   <p>Lucius Cary , second Viscount Falkland , may perhaps be defined as at once the most poetically chivalrous and the most philosophically moderate amongst all who took part in the pre-restoration struggles . He was killed in the royal army at the first battle of Newbury , Sep. 20 , 1643 , aged but 33 years , and buried , without mark or memorial , in the church of Great Tew ( North Oxfordshire ) , the manor of which he owned .</p>
   <p>English Eastern ; The common brake-fern and its allies seem to betray tropical sympathies by their late appearance and sensitiveness to autumnal frost .</p>
   <p>That Arlesian plain ; Now named the Crau . It lies between Aries and the sea — a bare and malarious tract of great size covered with shingle and boulders . Aeschylus describes it as a ‘ snow-shower of round stones , ’ which Zeus rained down in aid of Heracles , who was contending with the Ligurians .</p>
   <p>Mira ; A star in the Whale , conspicuous for its singular and rapid changes of apparent size .</p>
   <p>The Cause ; After passing through several phases this word , in Cromwell 's mouth , with the common logic of tyranny , became simply a synonym for personal rule .</p>
   <p>Smiting with iron heel ; The terrorism of the Protector 's government , and the almost universal hatred which it inspired , are powerfully painted by Hallam . ‘ To govern according to law may sometimes be an usurper 's wish , but can seldom be in his power . The protector abandoned all thought of it . . . . All illusion was now ( 1655 ) gone , as to the pretended benefits of the civil war . It had ended in a despotism , compared to which all the illegal practices of former kings , all that had cost Charles his life and crown , appeared as dust in the balance . ’</p>
   <p>The blood-path ; The trials under which Gerard and Vowel were executed in 1654 , Slingsby and Hewit in 1658 , are the most flagrant instances of Cromwell 's perversion of justice , and contempt for the old liberties of England . But they do not stand alone .</p>
   <p>Guile and coarseness ; ‘ A certain coarse good nature and affability that covered the want of conscience , honour , and humanity : quick in passion , but not vindictive , and averse to unnecessary crimes , ’ is the deliberate summing-up of Hallam ,— in the love of liberty inferior to none of our historians , and eminent above all for courageous impartiality ,— iustissimus unus .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>This tale is told by Mrs. Green , in her excellent Princesses of England , ( London , 1853 ) ,— a book deserving to be better known ,— on the authority of the Envoy Con .</p>
   <p>The first grief of a very happy and promising childhood may have been the loss of her sister Anne in 1640 . But by 1642 , the evils of the time began to press upon Princess Elizabeth ; her mother 's departure from England , followed by her own capture by order of the Parliament ; her confinement under conditions of varying severity ; and the final farewell to her father , Jan. 29 , 1649 .</p>
   <p>From that time her life was overshadowed by the sadness of her father 's death , her own isolation , and her increasing feebleness of health . She seems to have been a singularly winning and intelligent girl , and she hence found or inspired affection in several of the guardians successively appointed to take charge of her . But if she had not been thus marked by beauty of nature , our indignant disgust would hardly be less at the brutal treatment inflicted by the Puritan-Independent authorities upon this child :— at the refusal of her prayer to be sent to her elder sister Mary , in Holland ; at the captivity in Carisbrook ; at the isolation in which she was left to die .— Yet it is not she who most merits pity !</p>
   <p>In this poem , written before the plan of the book had been formed , I find that some slight deviation from the best authorities has been made . Elizabeth 's young brother Henry , Duke of Gloster , shared her prison : and although her own physician , Mayerne , had been dismissed , yet some medical attendance was supplied .— Henry Vaughan has described the patience of the young sufferer in two lovely lines :</p>

   <p>The general point of view from which this subject is here approached is given in the following passages :— ‘ The whole nation , ’ says Macaulay ( 1659 ) , ‘ was sick of government by the sword , and pined for government by the law . ’ Hence , when Charles landed , ‘ the cliffs of Dover were covered by thousands of gazers , among whom scarcely one could be found who was not weeping with delight . . . Every where flags were flying , bells and music sounding , wine and ale flowing in rivers to the health of him whose return was the return of peace , of law , and of freedom . ’ Nor was this astonishing : the name of the Commonwealth , a greater than Macaulay remarks , ‘ was grown infinitely odious : it was associated with the tyranny of ten years , the selfish rapacity of the Rump , the hypocritical despotism of Cromwell , the arbitrary sequestrations of committee-men , the iniquitous decimations of military prefects , the sale of British citizens for slavery in the West Indies , the blood of some shed on the scaffold without legal trial , . . . the persecution of the Anglican Church , the bacchanalian rant of sectaries , the morose preciseness of puritans . . . It is universally acknowledged that no measure was ever more national , or has ever produced more testimonies of public approbation , than the restoration of Charles II . . . . For the late government , whether under the parliament or the protector , had never obtained the sanction of popular consent , nor could have subsisted for a day without the support of the army . The King 's return seemed to the people the harbinger of a real liberty , instead of that bastard Commonwealth which had insulted them with its name ’ ( Hallam : Const . Hist . ch . x and xi ) .</p>

   <p>He saw not ; Ranke 's dispassionate summary of the attempted ‘ arrest of five members , ’ which has been always held one of the King 's most arbitrary steps , as it was , perhaps , the most fatal , illustrates the view here taken : ‘ The prerogative of the Crown , in the sense of the early kings ’ ( unconditional right of arrest , in cases of treason ) , ‘ and the privilege of Parliament , in the sense of coming times , were directly contradictory to each other ': ( viii : 10 ) .</p>
   <p>Till they drank the poison ; A sentence weighty with his judicial force may be here quoted from Hallam :— ‘ The desire of obtaining or retaining power , if it be ever sought as a means , is soon converted into an end . ’ The career of the Long Parliament supports this judgment : of it ‘ it may be said , I think , with not greater severity than truth , that scarce two or three public acts of justice , humanity , or generosity , and very few of political wisdom and courage , are recorded of them from their quarrel with the King to their expulsion by Cromwell ': ( Const . Hist . ch . x : Part i ) .</p>
   <p>The chrisom ; Name for the white cloth in which babes were veiled immediately after Baptism .</p>
   <p>Artist in plots ; See Ranke ( viii : 5 ) for Pym 's skilful use of a supposed plot , ( the main element in which was known by himself to be untrue ) , in older to terrify the House and ensure the destruction of Stafford ; and Hallam ( ch . ix ) .— Admiration of Pym may be taken as a proof that a historian is ignorant of , or faithless to , the fundamental principles of the Constitution :— as the worship of Cromwell is decisive against any man 's love of liberty , whatever his professions .</p>
   <p>O King ; ‘ Cromwell , like so many other usurpers , felt his position too precarious , or his vanity ungratified , without the name which mankind have agreed to worship . ’ The conversations recorded by Whitelock are conclusive on this point : ‘ and , though compelled to decline the crown , he undoubtedly did not lose sight of the object for the short remainder of his life ’ ( Hallam ) .</p>
   <p>The sky by a veil ; See Appendix D .</p>
   <p>And he walks ; ‘ He said on one occasion , He goes furthest who knows not whither he is going ': ( Ranke : xii : 1 ) .</p>
   <p>Purrs about God ; Examples , ( the tone of which justifies this phrase , and might deserve a severer ) , may be found by the curious in the frailties of poor human nature , passim , in Cromwell 's ‘ Letters and Speeches , ’ for which , ( although not always edited with precise accuracy ) , we are indebted to Mr. T. Carlyle . But the view which he takes of his ‘ hero , ’ whether in regard of many particular facts alleged or neglected , or of the general estimate of Cromwell as a man ,— as it appears to the author plainly untenable in face of proved historical facts , is here rejected .</p>
   <p>The familiar figure of the Tyrant , too long known to the world ,— with the iron , the clay , and the little gold often interfused also in the statue ,— has been always easily recognisable by unbiassed eyes in Oliver Cromwell . His tyranny was substantially that of his kind , before his time and since , in its actions , its spirit , its result . Fanaticism and Paradox may come with their apparatus of rhetoric to blur , as they whitewash , the lineaments of their idol . Such eulogists may ‘ paint an inch thick ': yet despots ,— political , military , ecclesiastical ,— will never be permanently acknowledged by the common sense of mankind as worthy the great name of Hero .</p>
   <p>The tyrannous Ten ; The Major-Generals , originally ten , ( but the number varied ) , amongst whom , in 1655 , the Commonwealth was divided . They displayed ‘ a rapacity and oppression beyond their master 's ’ ( Hallam ): a phrase amply supported by the hardly-impeachable evidence of Ludlow .</p>
   <p>The horrible sacrament ; See Appendix D .</p>
   <p>Why he cannot win hearts ; ‘ In the ascent of this bold usurper to greatness . . . he had encouraged the levellers and persecuted them ; he had flattered the Long Parliament and betrayed it ; he had made use of the sectaries to crush the Commonwealth ; he had spurned the sectaries in his last advance to power . These , with the Royalists and Presbyterians , forming in effect the whole people . . . were the perpetual , irreconcilable enemies of his administration ’ ( Hallam ch . x ) .</p>

   <p>The last ten years of Milton 's life were passed at his house situate in the ( then ) ‘ Artillery Walk , ’ Bunhill , near Aldersgate . He is described as a spare figure , of middle stature or a little less , who walked , generally clothed in a gray camblet overcoat , in the streets between Bunhill and Little Britain .</p>
   <p>Vergil ; placed first as most like Milton in consummate art and permanent exquisiteness of phrase . It is to him , also , ( if to any one ) , that Milton is metrically indebted .— The other poets classed as ‘ Imperial ’ are Homer , Sappho , Archilochus , Dante , Shakespeare . The supremacy in rank which the writer has here ventured to limit to these seven poets , ( though with a strong feeling of diffidence in view of certain other Hellenic and Roman claims ) , is assigned to Sappho and Archilochus , less on account of the scanty fragments , though they be ‘ more golden than gold , ’ which have reached us , than in confidence that the place collateral with Homer , given them by their countrymen ( who criticized as admirably as they created ) , was , in fact , justified by their poetry .</p>

   <p>Lord Macaulay 's lively description of this scene ( Hist . Ch iv ) should be referred to . ‘ Even then , ’ he says , ‘ the King had complained that he did not feel well . ’</p>
   <p>Tudor-Stuart ; This famous Gallery was of sixteenth-century date .</p>
   <p>When the heart ; The weariness of England under the triple yoke of Puritanism , the Independents , and the Protector , has been already noticed : ( Note on p. 125 ) .</p>
   <p>‘ The Restoration , ’ says Professor Seeley , in an able essay on current perversions of seventeenth-century-history , ‘ was not a return to servitude , but the precise contrary . It was a great emancipation , an exodus out of servitude into liberty . . . As to the later Stuarts , I regard them as pupils of Cromwell : . . . it was their great ambition to appropriate his methods , ’ ( and , we may add , to follow his foreign policy in regard to France and Holland ) , for the benefit of the old monarchy . They failed where their model had succeeded , and the distinction of having enslaved England remained peculiar to Cromwell . ’</p>

   <p>Monmouth 's invasion forms one of the most brilliant ,— perhaps the most brilliant ,— of Lord Macaulay 's narratives . But many curious details are added in the History by Mr. G Roberts ( 1844 ) .</p>
   <p>The belief , which this poem represents , that ‘ King Monmouth , ’ as he was called in the West , would return , lasted long . He landed in Lyme Bay , June 11 , 1685 , between the Cobb ( Harbour-pier ) and the beginning of the Ware cliffs : marching north , after a few days , by the road which left the ruins of Colway House on the right and led over Uplyme to Axminster .</p>
   <p>Soho ; the watch-word on Monmouth 's side at Sedgemoor ; his London house was in the Fields , ( now Square ) , bearing that name .</p>
   <p>Faithful Taunton ; here the Puritan spirit was strong ; and here Monmouth was persuaded to take the title of king ( June 20 ) , symbolized by the flag which the young girls of Taunton presented to him . It bore a crown with the cypher J B .— Monmouth 's own name being James .</p>
   <p>Dour deep trench ; Sedgemoor lies in a marshy district near Bridgewater , much intersected by trenches or ‘ Rhines . ’ One , the Busses Rhine , lay between the two armies as they fought , July 6 . Monmouth was caught hiding in Cranborne Chase , July 8 ; executed , after a vain attempt to move the heart of his uncle the king , July 15 , on Tower Hill .</p>

In the gallery of Whitehall he pined for the familiar House in the Wood at the Hague , and never was so happy as when he could quit the magnificence of Windsor for his humbler seat at Loo : ’ ( Macaulay : Hist . ch . vii )</p>

   <p>The brother ; The infant son of James , known afterwards as the ‘ Old Pretender , ’ or as James III . He was carried as an infant from the Palace ( Dec. 1688 ) to Lambeth , where he was in great peril of discovery . The story is picturesquely told by Macaulay .</p>
   <p>One blossom ; The Duke of Gloucester , who grew up to eleven years , dying in July 1700 . After his death Anne signed , in private letters , ‘ your unfortunate ’ friend .</p>
   <p>Anne 's character , says the candid Lecky , ‘ though somewhat peevish and very obstinate , was pure , generous , simple , and affectionate ; and she displayed , under bereavements far more numerous than fall to the share of most , a touching piety that endeared her to her people . ’</p>
   <p>Where the murder 'd Mary ; ‘ Above and around , in every direction , ’ says Dean Stanley , describing the vault beneath the monument of Mary of Scotland in Henry the Seventh 's Chapel ,— ‘ crushing by the accumulated weight of their small coffins the receptacles of the illustrious dust beneath , lie the eighteen children of Queen Anne , dying in infancy or stillborn , ending with William Duke of Gloucester , the last hope of the race : ’ ( Historical Memorials of Westminster Abbey , ch . iii ) .</p>

   <p>Blenheim is fully described in Lord Stanhope 's Reign of Queen Anne . Its importance as a critical battle in European history lies in the fact that the work of liberating the Great Alliance against the paramount power of France under Lewis XIV , ( which England had unwisely fostered from Cromwell to James II ) , was secured by this victory . ‘ The loss of France could not be measured by men or fortresses . A hundred victories since Rocroi had taught the world to regard the armies of Lewis as all but invincible , when Blenheim and the surrender of the flower of the French soldiery broke the spell ': ( Green : History of the English People : B. VIII : ch . iii ) .</p>
   <p>‘ The French and Bavarians , who numbered , like their opponents , some fifty thousand men , lay behind a little stream which ran through swampy ground to the Danube . . . It was not till midday that Eugene , who commanded on the right , succeeded in crossing the stream . The English foot at once forded it on the left . ’ They were repelled for the time . But , in the centre , Marlborough , ‘ by making an artificial road across the morass which covered it , ’ in two desperate charges turned the day .</p>
   <p>A map of 1705 in the Annals of Queen Anne 's Reign , shows vast hillsides to the right of the Allies covered with wood . This map also specifies the advance of the English in nine columns .</p>
   <p>Only less ; ‘ Marlborough , ’ says Lord Stanhope , ‘ was a humane and compassionate man . Even in the eagerness to pursue fresh conquests he did not ever neglect the care of the wounded . ’</p>

   <p>The sad old age of Prince Charles is described by Lord Mahon [ Stanhope ] in his able History : ch . xxx : and some additional details will be found in Chambers ’ narrative of the expedition . During later life , an almost entire silence seems to have been maintained by the Prince upon his earlier days and his royal claims . But the bagpipe was occasionally heard in the Roman Palace , and a casual visit , which Lord Mahon fixes in 1785 , drew forth the recital which is the subject of this poem . The prince fainted as he recalled what his Highland followers had gone through , and his daughter rushing in exclaimed to the visitor , ‘ Sir ! what is this ! You must have been speaking to my father about Scotland and the Highlanders ! No one dares to mention these subjects in his presence : ’ ( Mahon : ch . xxvi ) .</p>

   <p>Among the many wonders of Wellington 's Peninsular campaign , from Vimiera ( 1808 ) to Toulouse ( 1814 ) , the magnificent unity of scheme preserved throughout is , perhaps , the most wonderful : the dramatic coherence , development , and final catastrophe of triumph . For this , however , readers must be referred to Napier 's History ; Enough here to add that one of the most decisive steps was the formation of the lines in defence of Lisbon , of which the most northerly ran from Alhandra on the Tagus by Aruda and Zibreira to Torres Vedras near the sea-coast at the mouth of the Zizandre .</p>
   <p>When Freedom ; the unwise and uncertain management of the campaign by the English home Government has been set forth by Napier with so much emphasis as , in some degree , to impair the reader 's full conviction . Yet the amazing superiority in energy and wisdom with which Wellington towered over his contemporaries , ( the field being , however , cleared by the recent deaths of Nelson and Pitt ) , is so patent , that this attempt to do justice to his greatness is offered with hesitation and apology .</p>

   <p>The battle of Inkermann was mainly fought on a ridge of rock which projects from the south-eastern angle of Sebastapol : the English centre of operations being the ill-fortified line named the ‘ Home Ridge . ’ The numbers engaged in field-operations , roughly speaking , were 4 , 000 English against 40 , 000 Russians .</p>
   <p>The curtain-mist ; The battle began about 6 A. M. under heavy mist and drizzling rain , which lasted for several hours . Through this curtain the Russian forces coming down from the hill were seen only when near enough to darken the mist by their masses .</p>
   <p>Egerton ; He commanded four companies of the 77th , and charged early in the battle with brilliant success ;— his men , about 250 , scattering 1500 Russians .</p>
   <p>The gallant chief ; General Soimonoff , killed just after Egerton 's charge .</p>
   <p>With that old Albuera cry ; Prominent in the defence of the English main base of operations , the Home Ridge , against a weighty Russian advance , was Captain Stanley , commanding the 57th . This regiment , it was said , at the battle of Albuera had been encouraged by its colonel with the words , ‘ Fifty-seventh , die hard ':— and Stanley , having less than 400 against 2000 , thought the time had come to remind his ‘ Die-hards ’ of their traditional gallantry ;— after which he himself at once fell mortally wounded .</p>

   <p>The English garrison at Cawnpore , with a large number of sick , women , and children , were besieged in their hastily made and weak earthworks by Nana Sahib from June 6 to June 25 , 1857 . Compelled to surrender , under promise of safe convoy down the Ganges , on the 27th they were massacred by musketry from the banks ; the thatch of the river-boats being also fired . The survivors were murdered and thrown into the well upon Havelock 's approach on July 15 .</p>
   <p>One boat managed to escape unburnt on June 27 . It was chased through the 28th and 29th , by which time the crowd on board was reduced to fourteen men , one of whom , Mowbray-Thomson , has left a narrative equally striking from its vividness and its modesty . Seven escaped from the small temple in which they defended themselves ; four only finally survived to tell the story .</p>

   <p>The date prefixed is that of the visit which the Prince of Wales paid to the tomb of Washington : carrying home thence , as one of the most distinguished of his hosts said , ‘ an unwritten treaty of amity and alliance . ’</p>
   <p>Mount Vernon on the Potomac , named after the Admiral , was the family seat of Augustine , father to George Washington , and the residence of the latter from 1752 . But all his early years also had been spent in that neighbourhood , in those country pursuits which formed his ideal of life : and thither , on resigning his commission as Commander-in-Chief , he retired in 1785 ; devoting himself to farming and gardening with all the strenuousness and devoted passion of a Roman of Vergil 's type . And there ( Dec. 1799 ) was he buried .</p>
   <p>Not eager ; When the ill-feeling between England and America deepened after 1765 , Washington ‘ was less eager than some others in declaring or declaiming against the mother country ; ’ ( Mahon : Hist . ch . lii ) .</p>
   <p>Ripe to wed with Liberty ; See Appendix G .</p>
   <p>And to the end ; See Petrarch 's beautiful lines : Trionfo della Morte , cap . I .</p>
   <p>Due to the Liberator ; Compare the epitaph by Ennius on Scipio :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Hic est ille situs , cui nemo civi ’ neque hostis</l>
     <l n="2">Quivit pro factis reddere opis pretium .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>History , it may be said with reasonable confidence , records no hero more unselfish , no one less stained with human error and frailty , than George Washington .</p>
   <p>The years unknown ; It is to Odin , whatever date be thereby signified , that our royal genealogy runs back .</p>

   <p>Above the throne ; ‘ He knows that if Princes exist , it is for the good of the people . . . . Well for him that he does so , ’ was the remark made by an observing foreigner on Prince Albert : ( Martin : Life of H. R. H . the Prince Consort : ch . xi ) .</p>
   <p>On home alone ; ‘ She who reigns over us , ’ said the then Mr. Disraeli when seconding the Address on the death of the Duchess of Kent , ( March , 1861 ) , ‘ She who reigns over us has elected , amid all the splendour of empire , to establish her life on the principle of domestic love ’ ( Martin : ch . cxi ) .</p>
   <p>Firm and true , ‘ Treu und Fest ’ is the motto of the Saxe-Coburg family .</p>
   <p>Goodwill to men ; A revision of the despatch to the Cabinet of the United States , remonstrating on the ‘ Trent affair , ’ whilst the fatal fever was on him , was the last of Prince Albert 's many services ( Nov. 30 , 1861 ) to England . To the temperate and conciliatory tone which he gave to this message , its success in the promotion of peace between the two countries was largely due : ( Martin : ch . cxvi ) .</p>

    <head>APPENDIX</head>
    <p n="1">A : p. 87</p>
    <p n="2">Till the terrible Day unreveal 'd ; Much of course is and will probably remain unknown among the details of that fatal and fascinating drama , Mary 's life . But all hitherto ascertained evidence has now , mainly by Mr. Hosack , been sifted so closely and so ably that the main turning points in her career seem to have reached that twilight certainty beyond which History can rarely hope to go , and are placed beyond the reach of reasonable controversy . Such , ( not to enter upon the Queen 's life as Elizabeth 's captive ) , is the more than Macchiavellian — the almost incredible — perfidy of the leading Scottish politicians , united with a hypocrisy more revolting still , and enabled to do its wicked work , ( with regret we must confess ) , by the shortsighted bigotry of Knox :— The gradual forgery of the letters by which the Queen 's death was finally obtained from the too-willing hands of Elizabeth 's Cabinet :— The all but legally proved innocence of Mary in regard to Darnley 's death , and the Bothwell marriage . Taking her life as a whole , it may be fairly doubted whether any woman has ever been exposed to trials and temptations more severe , or has suffered more shamefully from false witness and fanatical hatred . But the prejudices which have been hence aroused are so strong , such great interests , religious and political , are involved in their maintenance , that they will doubtless prevail in the popular mind until our literature receives ,— what an age of research and of the scientific spirit should at last be prepared to give us ,— a tolerably truthful history of the Elizabethan period . ( 1889 )</p>
    <p n="3">B : p. 102</p>
    <p n="4">Heroes both ;— Each his side ;— In regard to the main issue at stake in the Civil War , and the view taken of it throughout this book , let me here once for all remark that no competent and impartial student of our history can deny a fair cause to each side , whatever errors may have been committed by Charles and by the Parliament , or however fatal for some fifteen years to liberty and national happiness were the excesses and the tyranny into which the victorious party gradually , and as it were inevitably , drifted . ‘ No one , ’ says Ranke ( whom I must often quote , because to this distinguished foreigner we owe the single , though too brief , narrative of this period in which history has been hitherto , treated historically , that is , without judging of the events by the light either of their remote results , or of modern political party ) , ‘ will make any very heavy political charge against Strafford on the score of his government of Ireland , or of the partisan attitude which he had taken up in the intestine struggle in England in general ; for the ideas for which he contended were as much to be found in the past history of England as were those which he attacked : ’ — and Hampden 's conduct may claim analogous justification . If the Parliament could appeal to those mediaeval precedents which admitted the right of the people through their representatives , to control taxation and ( more or less ) direct national policy , Charles , ( and Strafford with him ) , might as lawfully affirm that they too were standing ‘ on the ancient ways ’ ; on the royal supremacy undeniably exercised by Henry II or Edward I. by Henry VIII and by Elizabeth . Both parties could equally put forward the prosperity of England under these opposed modes of government : Patriotism , honour , conscience , were watchwords which either might use with truth or abuse with profit . If the great struggle be patiently studied , the moral praise and censure so freely given , according to a reader 's personal bias , will be found very rarely justified . There was far , very far , less of tyranny or of liberty involved in the contest , up to 1642 , than partisans aver . To the actual actors ( nor , as retrospectively criticized by us ) it is a fair battle on both sides , not a contest ‘ between light and darkness . ’</p>
    <p n="5">We , looking back after two centuries , are of course free to recognize , that one effect of the Tudor despotism had been to train Englishmen towards ruling themselves ;— we may agree that the time had come for Lords and Commons to take their part in the Kingdom . But no proof , I think it may be said , can be shown that this great idea , in any conscious sense , governed the Parliaments of James and Charles . It is we who ,— reviewing our history since the definite establishment of the constitutional balance after 1688 , and the many blessings the land has enjoyed ,— can perceive what in the seventeenth century was wholly hidden from Commonwealth and from King . And even if in accordance with the common belief , we ascribe English freedom and prosperity and good government to the final triumph of the popular side , yet deeper consideration should suggest that such retrospective judgments are always inevitably made under our human entire ignorance what might have been the result had the opposite party prevailed . Who should say how often , in case of these long and wide extended struggles ,— political and dynastic ,— the effects which we confidently claim as propter hoc , are only post hoc in the last reality ?</p>
    <p n="6">Waiving however these somewhat remote and what many will judge over-sceptical considerations , this is certain , that unless we can purify our judgment from reading into the history of the past the long results of time ;— from ascribing to the men of the seventeenth century prophetic insight into the nineteenth ;— unless , in short , we can free ourselves from the chain of present or personal prepossessions ;— no approach can be made to a fair or philosophical judgment upon such periods of strife and crisis as our Civil War preeminently offers .</p>
    <p n="7">C : p. 108</p>
    <p n="8">With glory he gilt ; Yet to readers , ( if such readers there be ) who can look with an undazzled eye on military success , or hear the still small voice of truth through the tempest of rhetoric , Cromwell 's foreign policy , ( excepting the isolated case of his interference with the then comparatively feeble powers of Savoy and the Papacy on behalf of the persecuted Waldenses ) , will be far from supporting the credit with which politico-theological partisanship has invested it .</p>
    <p n="9">Holland was beyond question the natural ally on political and religious grounds of puritan England . But a mischievous war against her in 1652-3 was caused by the arrogant restrictions of the Navigation Act of 1651 . The successful English demand in 1653 that the Orange family , as connected closely with that of Stuart , should be excluded from the Stadtholdership , was in a high degree to the prejudice of the United Provinces .</p>
    <p n="10">In 1654 Cromwell was negotiating with France and Spain . From the latter he arrogantly asked wholly unreasonable terms , whilst Mazarin , on the part of France , offered Dunkirk as a bribe . News opportunely arriving that certain Spanish possessions in America were feebly armed , Cromwell at once declared war : and now , supplementing unscrupulous policy by false theology , announced ‘ the Spaniards to be the natural and ordained enemies of England , whom to fight was a duty both to country and to religion : ’ ( Ranke : xii . 6 ) .</p>
    <p n="11">The piratical war which followed , in many ways similar to that which the ‘ wise Walpole ’ tried to avert in 1739 , was hardly less impolitic than immoral . It alienated Holland , it sanctioned French aggression on Flanders ( xii . 7 ) , it ended by giving Mazarin and Lewis XIV that supremacy in Western Europe for which England had to pay in the wars of William III and Anne ; whilst , as soon as it was over , France naturally allied herself with Spain , on a basis which might have caused the union of the two crowns ( xii . 8 ) and which allowed Spain at once to support Charles II . As the result of the Protector 's ‘ spirited policy ’ England thus figured as the catspaw of France , and the enemy of European liberty .</p>
    <p n="12">It is satisfactory , however , to find that , in Ranke 's judgment , the common modern opinion that Cromwell 's despotism was favourably regarded in England because of his foreign enterprize , is exaggerated . Even against the conquest of Jamaica ,— his single signal gain ,— unanswerable arguments were popularly urged at the time : ( xii . 4 , 8 ) — But the Protectorate , in the light of modern research ,— like the reign of Elizabeth ,— still awaits its historian .</p>
    <p n="13">D : p. 127</p>
    <p n="14">The sky by a veil ; ‘ A spiritual world , ’ says a critic of deep insight , ‘ over and above this invisible one , is a most important addition to our idea of the universe ; but it does not of itself touch our moral nature . . . . Its moral effect depends entirely upon what we make that world to be . ’ — Cromwell 's religion , which may be profitably studied in his letters and speeches , ( much better known of , than read ) reveals itself there as the simple reflex of his personal views : it had great power to animate , little or none to regulate or control his impulses . He had , indeed , a most real and pervading ‘ natural turn for the invisible ; he thought of the invisible till he died ; but the cloudy arch only canopied a field of human aim and will . ’</p>
    <p n="15">The horrible sacrament ; The summary of Cromwell 's conduct at Drogheda by a writer of so much research , impartiality , and philosophic liberality as Mr. Lecky deserves to be well considered .</p>
    <p n="16">‘ The sieges of Drogheda and Wexford , and the massacres that accompanied them , deserve to rank in horror with the most atrocious exploits of Tilly and Wallenstein , and they made the name of Cromwell eternally hated in Ireland . It even now acts as a spell upon the Irish mind , and has a powerful and living influence in sustaining the hatred both of England and Protestantism . The massacre of Drogheda acquired a deeper horror and a special significance from the saintly professions and the religious phraseology of its perpetrators , and the town where it took place is , to the present day , distinguished in Ireland for the vehemence of its Catholicism : ’ ( Hist . of Eighteenth Cent . ch . vi ) .</p>
    <p n="17">Mortal failure ; The ever-increasing unsuccess of Cromwell 's career is forcibly set forth by Ranke ( xii . 8 ) . He had ‘ crushed every enemy ,— the Scottish and the Presbyterian system , the peers and the king , the Long Parliament and the Cavalier insurgents ,— but to create . . . an organization consistent with the authority which had fallen to his own lot , was beyond his power . Even among his old ’ Anabaptist and Independent ‘ friends , his comrades in the field , his colleagues in the establishment of the Commonwealth , he encountered the most obstinate resistance . . . . At no time were the prisons fuller ; the number of political prisoners was estimated at 12 , 000 . . . The failure of his plans soured and distracted him . ’ It was , in fact , wholly ‘ beyond his power to consolidate a tolerably durable political constitution . ’ — To the disquiet caused by constant attempts against Cromwell 's life , Ranke adds the death of his favourite daughter , Lady Claypole , whose last words of agony ‘ were of the right of the king , the blood that had been shed , the revenge to come . ’</p>
    <p n="18">E : p. 146</p>
    <p n="19">Unheirlike heir ; Richard Cromwell has received double measure of that censure which the world 's judgment too readily gives to unsuccess , finding favour neither from Royalists nor Cromwellians . Macaulay , with more justice , remarks , ‘ That he was a good man he evinced by proofs more satisfactory than deep groans or long sermons , by humility and suavity when he was at the height of human greatness , and by cheerful resignation under cruel wrongs and misfortunes . ’ . . . ‘ He did nothing amiss during his short administration . ’</p>
    <p n="20">His fall may be traced to several causes : to the fact that the puritan party proper , who supported him , the ‘ sober men ’ mentioned by Baxter ‘ that called his father no better than a traitorous hypocrite , ’ had not power to resist the fanatic cabal of army chiefs : to the necessity he was under of protecting some justly-odious confederates of Oliver : his own want of ability or energy to govern ,— a point fully recognized during Oliver 's supremacy ; and to his own honourable decision not to ‘ have a drop of blood shed on his poor account . ’ Yet there is ample evidence to show that Richard , had he chosen , might have made a struggle to retain the throne ,— sufficient , at least , to have thus deluged the kingdom .</p>
    <p n="21">Richard 's life was passed in great quiet after 1660 : Charles II , according to Clarendon , with a wise and humorous lenity , not thinking it ‘ necessary to inquire after a man so long forgotten . ’ His letters reveal a man of affectionate and honest disposition ; he uses the Puritan phraseology of the day without leaving a sense of nausea in the reader 's mind . At Hursley he was buried at a good old age in 1712 .</p>
    <p n="22">F : p. 152</p>
    <p n="23">A nation 's craven rage ; The want of public spirit in England shown during the war of 1745-6 is astonishing . ‘ England , ’ wrote Henry Fox , ‘ is for the first comer . . . Had 5 , 000 [ French troops ] landed in any part of this island a week ago , I verily believe the entire conquest of it would not have cost them a battle . ’ And other weighty testimonies might be added , in support of Lord Mahon 's view as to the great probability of the Prince 's success , had he been allowed by his followers to march upon London from Derby .</p>
    <p n="24">This apathy and the panic which followed found their natural issue in the sanguinary punishment of the followers of Prince Charles . ‘ The city and the generality , ’ wrote H. Walpole in August , 1746 , ‘ are very angry that so many rebels have been pardoned . ’ The vindictive cruelty then shown makes , in truth ( if we compare the magnitude and duration of the rebellion for which punishment was to be exacted ) , an unsatisfactory contrast to the leniency of 1660 . But History supplies only too numerous proofs that a century 's march in civilisation may be always undone at once by the demons of Panic or of Party in the hour of their respective triumphs .</p>
    <p n="25">G : p. 169</p>
    <p n="26">Ripe to wed with Liberty ; Looking at the American War of Independence without party-passion and distortion , as should now at least be possible to Englishmen , the main cause must be acknowledged to lie simply in the growth and geographical position of the Colonies , which had brought them to the age of natural liberty , and had begun to fit them for its exercise :— facts which it was equally in accordance with nature that the Fatherland should fail to perceive . For the causes which gradually determined American resistance we must look , ( as regards us ) , not to the blundering English legislation after 1760 ,— to the formalism of Grenville , the subterfuges of Franklin ,— but to the whole course of our commercial policy since the Revolution : As regards the Colonies , to the extinction of the power of France in America by the Treaty of Paris in 1763 : ( Lecky : ch . v ; Mahon : ch . xliii ) .</p>
    <p n="27">The Stamp Act of 1765 brought home , indeed , to a rapidly-developing people the supremacy claimed across the Atlantic ; but the obnoxious taxation which it imposed , ( despite the splendid sophistry of Chatham ) , cannot be shown to differ essentially from the trade restrictions and monopolies enacted in long series after 1688 , as the result of the predominance obtained at the Revolution by the commercial classes in this country , and which so far as 1765 the colonies openly recognized as legal .</p>
    <p n="28">Going , however , beyond these minor motives , the true cause was unquestionably that the time for separate life , for America to be herself , had come . This was a crisis which home-legislation could do little to create or to avert : a natural law , which only worked itself out ostensibly by political manoeuvres and military operations , so ill-managed as to be rarely creditable to either side ;— and , regarded simply as a ‘ struggle for existence , ’ is , in the eye of impartial history , hardly within the scope of praise or censure .</p>
    <p n="29">But it was a neutrally tinted background like this , which could most effectually bring into full relief the great qualities of the one great man who was prominent in the conflict .</p>
