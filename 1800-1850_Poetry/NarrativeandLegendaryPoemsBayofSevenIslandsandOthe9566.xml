    <head>THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS .</head>
    <head>The volume in which “ The Bay of Seven Islands ” was published was dedicated to the late Edwin Percy Whipple , to whom more than to any other person I was indebted for public recognition as one worthy of a place in American literature , at a time when it required a great degree of courage to urge such a claim for a pro-scribed abolitionist . Although younger than I , he had gained the reputation of a brilliant essayist , and was regarded as the highest American authority in criticism . His wit and wisdom enlivened a small literary circle of young men including Thomas Starr King , the eloquent preacher , and Daniel N. Haskell of the Daily Transcript , who gathered about our common friend dames T. Fields at the Old Corner Bookstore . The poem which gave title to the volume I inscribed to my friend and neighbor Harriet Prescott Spofford , whose poems have lent a new interest to our beautiful river-valley .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">FROM the green Amesbury hill which bears the name</l>
     <l n="2">Of that half mythic ancestor of mine</l>
     <l n="3">Who trod its slopes two hundred years ago ,</l>
     <l n="4">Down the long valley of the Merrimac ,</l>
     <l n="5">Midway between me and the river 's mouth ,</l>
     <l n="6">I see thy home , set like an eagle 's nest</l>
     <l n="7">Among Deer Island 's immemorial pines ,</l>
     <l n="8">Crowning the crag on which the sunset breaks</l>
     <l n="9">Its last red arrow . Many a tale and song ,</l>
     <l n="10">Which thou bast told or sung , I call to mind ,</l>
     <l n="11">Softening with silvery mist the woods and hills ,</l>
     <l n="12">The out-thrust headlands and inreaching bays</l>
     <l n="13">Of our northeastern coast-line , trending where</l>
     <l n="14">The Gulf , midsummer , feels the chill blockade</l>
     <l n="15">Of icebergs stranded at its northern gate .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="16">To thee the echoes of the Island Sound</l>
     <l n="17">Answer not vainly , nor in vain the moan</l>
     <l n="18">Of the South Breaker prophesying storm .</l>
     <l n="19">And thou hast listened , like myself , to men</l>
     <l n="20">Sea-periled oft where Anticosti lies</l>
     <l n="21">Like a fell spider in its web of fog ,</l>
     <l n="22">Or where the Grand Bank shallows with the wrecks</l>
     <l n="23">Of sunken fishers , and to whom strange isles</l>
     <l n="24">And frost-rimmed bays and trading stations seem</l>
     <l n="25">Familiar as Great Neck and Kettle Cove ,</l>
     <l n="26">Nubble and Boon , the common names of home .</l>
     <l n="27">So let me offer thee this lay of mine ,</l>
     <l n="28">Simple and homely , lacking much thy play</l>
     <l n="29">Of color and of fancy . If its theme</l>
     <l n="30">And treatment seem to thee befitting youth</l>
     <l n="31">Rather than age , let this be my excuse</l>
     <l n="32">It has beguiled some heavy hours and called</l>
     <l n="33">Some pleasant memories up ; and , better still ,</l>
     <l n="34">Occasion lent me for a kindly word</l>
     <l n="35">To one who is my neighbor and my friend .</l>

     <l n="38">The skipper sailed out of the harbor mouth ,</l>
     <l n="39">Leaving the apple-bloom of the South</l>
     <l n="40">For the ice of the Eastern seas ,</l>
     <l n="41">In his fishing schooner Breeze .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="42">Handsome and brave and young was he ,</l>
     <l n="43">And the maids of Newbury sighed to see</l>
     <l n="44">His lessening white sail fall</l>
     <l n="45">Under the sea 's blue wall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="46">Through the Northern Gulf and the misty screen</l>
     <l n="47">Of the isles of Mingan and Madeleine ,</l>
     <l n="48">St. Paul 's and Blanc Sablon ,</l>
     <l n="49">The little Breeze sailed on ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="50">Backward and forward , along the shore</l>
     <l n="51">Of lorn and desolate Labrador ,</l>
     <l n="52">And found at last her way</l>
     <l n="53">To the Seven Islands Bay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="54">The little hamlet , nestling below</l>
     <l n="55">Great hills white with lingering snow ,</l>
     <l n="56">With its tin-roofed chapel stood</l>
     <l n="57">Half hid in the dwarf spruce wood ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="58">Green-turfed , flower-sown , the last outpost</l>
     <l n="59">Of summer upon the dreary coast ,</l>
     <l n="60">With its gardens small and spare ,</l>
     <l n="61">Sad in the frosty air .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="62">Hard by where the skipper 's schooner lay ,</l>
     <l n="63">A fisherman 's cottage looked away</l>
     <l n="64">Over isle and bay , and . behind</l>
     <l n="65">On mountains dim-defined .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="66">And there twin sisters , fair and young ,</l>
     <l n="67">Laughed with their stranger guest , and sung</l>
     <l n="68">In their native tongue the lays</l>
     <l n="69">Of the old Provencal days .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="70">Alike were they , save the faint outline</l>
     <l n="71">Of a scar on Suzette 's forehead fine ;</l>
     <l n="72">And both , it so befell ,</l>
     <l n="73">Loved the heretic stranger well .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="74">Both were pleasant to look upon ,</l>
     <l n="75">But the heart of the skipper clave to one ;</l>
     <l n="76">Though less by his eye than heart</l>
     <l n="77">He knew the twain apart .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="78">Despite of alien race and creed ,</l>
     <l n="79">Well did his wooing of Marguerite speed ;</l>
     <l n="80">And the mother 's wrath was vain</l>
     <l n="81">As the sister 's jealous pain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="82">The shrill-tongued mistress her house forbade ,</l>
     <l n="83">And solemn warning was sternly said</l>
     <l n="84">By the black-robed priest , whose word</l>
     <l n="85">As law the hamlet heard .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="86">But half by voice and half by signs</l>
     <l n="87">The skipper said , “ A warm sun shines</l>
     <l n="88">On the green-banked Merrimac ;</l>
     <l n="89">Wait , watch , till I come back .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="90">“ And when you see , from my mast head ,</l>
     <l n="91">The signal fly of a kerchief red ,</l>
     <l n="92">My boat on the shore shall wait ;</l>

     <l n="94">Ah ! weighed with childhood 's haunts and friends ,</l>

     <l n="97">To turn the trembling scale ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="98">Under the night , on the wet sea sands ,</l>
     <l n="99">Slowly unclasped their plighted hands</l>
     <l n="100">One to the cottage hearth ,</l>
     <l n="101">And one to his sailor 's berth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="102">What was it the parting lovers heard ?</l>
     <l n="103">Nor leaf , nor ripple , nor wing of bird ,</l>
     <l n="104">But a listener 's stealthy tread</l>
     <l n="105">On the rock-moss , crisp and dead .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="106">He weighed his anchor , and fished once more</l>
     <l n="107">By the black coast-line of Labrador ;</l>
     <l n="108">And by love and the north wind driven ,</l>
     <l n="109">Sailed back to the Islands Seven .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="110">In the sunset 's glow the sisters twain</l>
     <l n="111">Saw the Breeze come sailing in again ;</l>
     <l n="112">Said Suzette , “ Mother dear ,</l>
     <l n="113">The heretic 's sail is here . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="114">“ Go , Marguerite , to your room , and hide ;</l>
     <l n="115">Your door shall be bolted ! ” the mother cried :</l>
     <l n="116">While Suzette , ill at ease ,</l>
     <l n="117">Watched the red sign of the Breeze .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="118">At midnight , down to the waiting skiff</l>
     <l n="119">She stole in the shadow of the cliff ;</l>
     <l n="120">And out of the Bay 's mouth ran</l>
     <l n="121">The schooner with maid and man .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="122">And all night long , on a restless bed ,</l>
     <l n="123">Her prayers to the Virgin Marguerite said</l>
     <l n="124">And thought of her lover 's pain</l>
     <l n="125">Waiting for her in vain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="126">Did he pace the sands ? Did he pause to hear</l>
     <l n="127">The sound of her light step drawing near ?</l>
     <l n="128">And , as the slow hours passed ,</l>
     <l n="129">Would he doubt her faith at last ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="130">But when she saw through the misty pane ,</l>
     <l n="131">The morning break on a sea of rain ,</l>
     <l n="132">Could even her love avail</l>
     <l n="133">To follow his vanished sail ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="134">Meantime the Breeze , with favoring wind ,</l>
     <l n="135">Left the rugged Moisic hills behind ,</l>
     <l n="136">And heard from an unseen shore</l>
     <l n="137">The falls of Manitou roar .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="138">On the morrow 's morn , in the thick , gray weather</l>
     <l n="139">They sat on the reeling deck together ,</l>
     <l n="140">Lover and counterfeit ,</l>
     <l n="141">Of hapless Marguerite .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="142">With a lover 's hand , from her forehead fair</l>
     <l n="143">He smoothed away her jet-black hair .</l>
     <l n="144">What was it his fond eyes met ?</l>
     <l n="145">The scar of the false Suzette !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="146">Fiercely he shouted : “ Bear away</l>
     <l n="147">East by north for Seven Isles Bay ! ”</l>
     <l n="148">The maiden wept and prayed ,</l>
     <l n="149">But the ship her helm obeyed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="150">Once more the Bay of the Isles they found</l>
     <l n="151">They heard the bell of the chapel sound ,</l>
     <l n="152">And the chant of the dying sung</l>
     <l n="153">In the harsh , wild Indian tongue .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="33">
     <l n="154">A feeling of mystery , change , and awe</l>
     <l n="155">Was in all they heard and all they saw</l>
     <l n="156">Spell-bound the hamlet lay</l>
     <l n="157">In the hush of its lonely bay .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="34">
     <l n="158">And when they came to the cottage door ,</l>
     <l n="159">The mother rose up from her weeping sore ,</l>
     <l n="160">And with angry gestures met</l>
     <l n="161">The scared look of Suzette .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="35">
     <l n="162">“ Here is your daughter , ” the skipper said ;</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="36">
     <l n="166">He looked . Her sweet face still and white</l>
     <l n="167">And strange in the noonday taper light ,</l>
     <l n="168">She lay on her little bed ,</l>
     <l n="169">With the cross at her feet and head .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="37">
     <l n="170">In a passion of grief the strong man bent</l>
     <l n="171">Down to her face , and , kissing it , went</l>
     <l n="172">Back to the waiting Breeze ,</l>
     <l n="173">Back to the mournful seas .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="38">
     <l n="174">Never again to the Merrimac</l>

   <p>HOW THE WOMEN WENT FROM DOVER .</p>
   <p>The following is a copy of the warrant issued by Major Waldron , of Dover , in 1662 . The Quakers , as was their wont , prophesied against him , and saw , as they supposed , the fulfilment of their prophecy when , many years after , he was killed by the Indians .</p>
   <p>To the constables of Dover , Hampton , Salisbury , Newbury , Rowley , Ipswich , Wenham , Lynn , Boston , Roxbury , Dedham , and until these vagabond Quakers are carried out of this jurisdiction . You , and every one of you , are required , in the King 's Majesty 's name , to take these vagabond Quakers , Anne Colman , Mary Tomkins , and Alice Ambrose , and make them fast to the cart 's tail , and driving the cart through your several towns , to whip them upon their naked backs not exceeding ten stripes apiece on each of them , in each town ; and so to convey them from constable to constable till they are out of this jurisdiction , as you will answer it at your peril ; and this shall be your warrant . RICHARD WALDRON . Dated at Dover , December 22 , 1662 .</p>
   <p>This warrant was executed only in Dover and Hampton . At Salisbury the constable refused to obey it . He was sustained by the town 's people , who were under the influence of Major Robert Pike , the leading man in the lower valley of the Merrimac , who stood far in advance of his time , as an advocate of religious freedom , and an opponent of ecclesiastical authority . He had the moral courage to address an able and manly letter to the court at Salem , remonstrating against the witchcraft trials .</p>

     <l n="13">So drooped and died her home-blown rose of bliss</l>

     <l n="2">Set in green clearings passed the exiled Friend ,</l>
     <l n="3">In simple trust , misdoubting not the end .</l>
     <l n="4">“ Dear heart of mine ! ” he said , “ the time has come</l>
     <l n="5">To trust the Lord for shelter . ” One long gaze</l>
     <l n="6">The goodwife turned on each familiar thing ,—</l>
     <l n="7">The lowing kine , the orchard blossoming ,</l>
     <l n="8">The open door that showed the hearth-fire 's blaze ,—</l>
     <l n="9">And calmly answered , “ Yes , He will provide . ”</l>
     <l n="10">Silent and slow they crossed the homestead 's bound ,</l>
     <l n="11">Lingering the longest by their child 's grave-mound .</l>
     <l n="12">“ Move on , or stay and hang ! ” the sheriff cried .</l>
     <l n="13">They left behind them more than home or land ,</l>
     <l n="14">And set sad faces to an alien strand .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="15">Safer with winds and waves than human wrath ,</l>

   <p>THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN .</p>
   <p>The hint of this ballad is found in Arndt 's Miirchen , Berlin , 1816 . The ballad appeared first in St. Nicholas , whose young readers were advised , while smiling at the absurd superstition , to remember that bad companionship and evil habits , desires , and passions are more to be dreaded now than the Elves and Trolls who frightened the children of past ages .</p>
   <p>THE pleasant isle of Rugen looks the Baltic water o'er , To the silver-sanded beaches of the Pomeranian shore ;</p>
   <p>And in the town of Rambin a little boy and maid Plucked the meadow-flowers together and in the sea-surf played .</p>
   <p>Alike were they in beauty if not in their degree He was the Amptman 's first-born , the miller 's child was she .</p>
   <p>Now of old the isle of Rugen was full of Dwarfs and Trolls , The brown-faced little Earth-men , the people without souls ;</p>
   <p>And for every man and woman in Rugen 's island found Walking in air and sunshine , a Troll was underground .</p>
   <p>It chanced the little maiden , one morning , strolled away Among the haunted Nine Hills , where the elves and goblins play .</p>
   <p>That day , in barley-fields below , the harvesters had known Of evil voices in the air , and heard the small horns blown .</p>
   <p>She came not back ; the search for her in field and wood was vain They cried her east , they cried her west , but she came not again .</p>
   <p>“ She 's down among the Brown Dwarfs , ” said the dream-wives wise and old , And prayers were made , and masses said , and Rambin 's church bell tolled .</p>
   <p>Five years her father mourned her ; and then John Deitrich said “ I will find my little playmate , be she alive or dead . ”</p>
   <p>He watched among the Nine Hills , he heard the Brown Dwarfs sing , And saw them dance by moonlight merrily in a ring .</p>
   <p>And when their gay-robed leader tossed up his cap of red , Young Deitrich caught it as it fell , and thrust it on his head .</p>
   <p>The Troll came crouching at his feet and wept for lack of it . “ Oh , give me back my magic cap , for your great head unfit ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Nay , ” Deitrich said ; “ the Dwarf who throws his charmed cap away , Must serve its finder at his will , and for his folly pay .</p>
   <p>“ You stole my pretty Lisbeth , and hid her in the earth ; And you shall ope the door of glass and let me lead her forth . ”</p>
   <p>“ She will not come ; she 's one of us ; she 's mine ! ” the Brown Dwarf said ; The day is set , the cake is baked , to-morrow we shall wed . ”</p>
   <p>“ The fell fiend fetch thee ! ” Deitrich cried , “ and keep thy foul tongue still . Quick ! open , to thy evil world , the glass door of the hill ! ”</p>
   <p>The Dwarf obeyed ; and youth and Troll down , the long stair-way passed , And saw in dim and sunless light a country strange and vast .</p>
   <p>Weird , rich , and wonderful , he saw the elfin under-land ,— Its palaces of precious stones , its streets of golden sand .</p>
   <p>He came unto a banquet-hall with tables richly spread , Where a young maiden served to him the red wine and the bread .</p>
   <p>How fair she seemed among the Trolls so ugly and so wild ! Yet pale and very sorrowful , like one who never smiled !</p>
   <p>Her low , sweet voice , her gold-brown hair , her tender blue eyes seemed Like something he had seen elsewhere or some . thing he had dreamed .</p>
   <p>He looked ; he clasped her in his arms ; he knew the long-lost one ; “ O Lisbeth ! See thy playmate — I am the Amptman 's son ! ”</p>
   <p>She leaned her fair head on his breast , and through her sobs she spoke “ Oh , take me from this evil place , and from the elfin folk ,</p>
   <p>“ And let me tread the grass-green fields and smell the flowers again , And feel the soft wind on my cheek and hear the dropping rain !</p>
   <p>“ And oh , to hear the singing bird , the rustling of the tree , The lowing cows , the bleat of sheep , the voices of the sea ;</p>
   <p>“ And oh , upon my father 's knee to sit beside the door , And hear the bell of vespers ring in Rambin church once more ! ”</p>
   <p>He kissed her cheek , he kissed her lips ; the Brown Dwarf groaned to see , And tore his tangled hair and ground his long teeth angrily .</p>
   <p>But Deitrich said : “ For five long years this tender Christian maid Has served you in your evil world and well must she be paid !</p>
   <p>“ Haste !— hither bring me precious gems , the richest in your store ; Then when we pass the gate of glass , you 'll take your cap once more . ”</p>
   <p>No choice was left the baffled Troll , and , murmuring , he obeyed , And filled the pockets of the youth and apron of the maid .</p>
   <p>They left the dreadful under-land and passed the gate of glass ; They felt the sunshine 's warm caress , they trod the soft , green grass .</p>
   <p>And when , beneath , they saw the Dwarf stretch up to them his brown And crooked claw-like fingers , they tossed his red cap down .</p>
   <p>Oh , never shone so bright a sun , was never sky so blue , As hand in hand they homeward walked the pleasant meadows through !</p>
   <p>And never sang the birds so sweet in Rambin 's woods before , And never washed the waves so soft along the Baltic shore ;</p>
   <p>And when beneath his door-yard trees the father met his child , The bells rung out their merriest peal , the folks with joy ran wild .</p>
