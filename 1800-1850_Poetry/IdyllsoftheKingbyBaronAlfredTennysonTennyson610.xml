     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">These to His Memory — since he held them dear ,</l>
       <l n="2">Perchance as finding there unconsciously</l>
       <l n="3">Some image of himself — I dedicate ,</l>
       <l n="4">I dedicate , I consecrate with tears —</l>
       <l n="5">These Idylls .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="6">And indeed He seems to me</l>
       <l n="7">Scarce other than my king 's ideal knight ,</l>
       <l n="8">‘ Who reverenced his conscience as his king ;</l>
       <l n="9">Whose glory was , redressing human wrong ;</l>
       <l n="10">Who spake no slander , no , nor listened to it ;</l>
       <l n="11">Who loved one only and who clave to her — ’</l>
       <l n="12">Her — over all whose realms to their last isle ,</l>
       <l n="13">Commingled with the gloom of imminent war ,</l>
       <l n="14">The shadow of His loss drew like eclipse ,</l>
       <l n="15">Darkening the world . We have lost him : he is gone :</l>
       <l n="16">We know him now : all narrow jealousies</l>
       <l n="17">Are silent ; and we see him as he moved ,</l>
       <l n="18">How modest , kindly , all-accomplished , wise ,</l>
       <l n="19">With what sublime repression of himself ,</l>
       <l n="20">And in what limits , and how tenderly ;</l>
       <l n="21">Not swaying to this faction or to that ;</l>
       <l n="22">Not making his high place the lawless perch</l>
       <l n="23">Of winged ambitions , nor a vantage-ground</l>
       <l n="24">For pleasure ; but through all this tract of years</l>
       <l n="25">Wearing the white flower of a blameless life ,</l>
       <l n="26">Before a thousand peering littlenesses ,</l>
       <l n="27">In that fierce light which beats upon a throne ,</l>
       <l n="28">And blackens every blot : for where is he ,</l>
       <l n="29">Who dares foreshadow for an only son</l>
       <l n="30">A lovelier life , a more unstained , than his ?</l>
       <l n="31">Or how should England dreaming of his sons</l>
       <l n="32">Hope more for these than some inheritance</l>
       <l n="33">Of such a life , a heart , a mind as thine ,</l>
       <l n="34">Thou noble Father of her Kings to be ,</l>
       <l n="35">Laborious for her people and her poor —</l>
       <l n="36">Voice in the rich dawn of an ampler day —</l>
       <l n="37">Far-sighted summoner of War and Waste</l>
       <l n="38">To fruitful strifes and rivalries of peace —</l>
       <l n="39">Sweet nature gilded by the gracious gleam</l>
       <l n="40">Of letters , dear to Science , dear to Art ,</l>
       <l n="41">Dear to thy land and ours , a Prince indeed ,</l>
       <l n="42">Beyond all titles , and a household name ,</l>
       <l n="43">Hereafter , through all times , Albert the Good .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="44">Break not , O woman'shYpppHeNheart , but still endure ;</l>

       <l n="46">Remembering all the beauty of that star</l>
       <l n="47">Which shone so close beside Thee that ye made</l>
       <l n="48">One light together , but has past and leaves</l>
       <l n="49">The Crown a lonely splendour .</l>

       <l n="1">The Coming of Arthur</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="2">Leodogran , the King of Cameliard ,</l>
       <l n="3">Had one fair daughter , and none other child ;</l>
       <l n="4">And she was the fairest of all flesh on earth ,</l>
       <l n="5">Guinevere , and in her his one delight .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="6">For many a petty king ere Arthur came</l>
       <l n="7">Ruled in this isle , and ever waging war</l>
       <l n="8">Each upon other , wasted all the land ;</l>
       <l n="9">And still from time to time the heathen host</l>
       <l n="10">Swarmed overseas , and harried what was left .</l>
       <l n="11">And so there grew great tracts of wilderness ,</l>
       <l n="12">Wherein the beast was ever more and more ,</l>
       <l n="13">But man was less and less , till Arthur came .</l>
       <l n="14">For first Aurelius lived and fought and died ,</l>
       <l n="15">And after him King Uther fought and died ,</l>
       <l n="16">But either failed to make the kingdom one .</l>
       <l n="17">And after these King Arthur for a space ,</l>
       <l n="18">And through the puissance of his Table Round ,</l>
       <l n="19">Drew all their petty princedoms under him .</l>
       <l n="20">Their king and head , and made a realm , and reigned .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="21">And thus the land of Cameliard was waste ,</l>
       <l n="22">Thick with wet woods , and many a beast therein ,</l>
       <l n="23">And none or few to scare or chase the beast ;</l>
       <l n="24">So that wild dog , and wolf and boar and bear</l>
       <l n="25">Came night and day , and rooted in the fields ,</l>
       <l n="26">And wallowed in the gardens of the King .</l>
       <l n="27">And ever and anon the wolf would steal</l>
       <l n="28">The children and devour , but now and then ,</l>
       <l n="29">Her own brood lost or dead , lent her fierce teat</l>
       <l n="30">To human sucklings ; and the children , housed</l>
       <l n="31">In her foul den , there at their meat would growl ,</l>
       <l n="32">And mock their foster mother on four feet ,</l>
       <l n="33">Till , straightened , they grew up to wolf-like men ,</l>
       <l n="34">Worse than the wolves . And King Leodogran</l>
       <l n="35">Groaned for the Roman legions here again ,</l>
       <l n="36">And Caesar 's eagle : then his brother king ,</l>
       <l n="37">Urien , assailed him : last a heathen horde ,</l>
       <l n="38">Reddening the sun with smoke and earth with blood ,</l>
       <l n="39">And on the spike that split the mother 's heart</l>
       <l n="40">Spitting the child , brake on him , till , amazed ,</l>
       <l n="41">He knew not whither he should turn for aid .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="42">But — for he heard of Arthur newly crowned ,</l>
       <l n="43">Though not without an uproar made by those</l>
       <l n="44">Who cried , ‘ He is not Uther 's son ’ — the King</l>
       <l n="45">Sent to him , saying , ‘ Arise , and help us thou !</l>
       <l n="46">For here between the man and beast we die . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="47">And Arthur yet had done no deed of arms ,</l>
       <l n="48">But heard the call , and came : and Guinevere</l>
       <l n="49">Stood by the castle walls to watch him pass ;</l>
       <l n="50">But since he neither wore on helm or shield</l>
       <l n="51">The golden symbol of his kinglihood ,</l>
       <l n="52">But rode a simple knight among his knights ,</l>
       <l n="53">And many of these in richer arms than he ,</l>
       <l n="54">She saw him not , or marked not , if she saw ,</l>
       <l n="55">One among many , though his face was bare .</l>
       <l n="56">But Arthur , looking downward as he past ,</l>
       <l n="57">Felt the light of her eyes into his life</l>
       <l n="58">Smite on the sudden , yet rode on , and pitched</l>
       <l n="59">His tents beside the forest . Then he drave</l>
       <l n="60">The heathen ; after , slew the beast , and felled</l>
       <l n="61">The forest , letting in the sun , and made</l>
       <l n="62">Broad pathways for the hunter and the knight</l>
       <l n="63">And so returned .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="64">For while he lingered there ,</l>
       <l n="65">A doubt that ever smouldered in the hearts</l>
       <l n="66">Of those great Lords and Barons of his realm</l>
       <l n="67">Flashed forth and into war : for most of these ,</l>
       <l n="68">Colleaguing with a score of petty kings ,</l>
       <l n="69">Made head against him , crying , ‘ Who is he</l>
       <l n="70">That he should rule us ? who hath proven him</l>
       <l n="71">King Uther 's son ? for lo ! we look at him ,</l>
       <l n="72">And find nor face nor bearing , limbs nor voice ,</l>
       <l n="73">Are like to those of Uther whom we knew .</l>
       <l n="74">This is the son of Gorlois , not the King ;</l>
       <l n="75">This is the son of Anton , not the King . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="76">And Arthur , passing thence to battle , felt</l>
       <l n="77">Travail , and throes and agonies of the life ,</l>
       <l n="78">Desiring to be joined with Guinevere ;</l>
       <l n="79">And thinking as he rode , ‘ Her father said</l>
       <l n="80">That there between the man and beast they die .</l>
       <l n="81">Shall I not lift her from this land of beasts</l>
       <l n="82">Up to my throne , and side by side with me ?</l>
       <l n="83">What happiness to reign a lonely king ,</l>
       <l n="84">Vext — O ye stars that shudder over me ,</l>
       <l n="85">O earth that soundest hollow under me ,</l>
       <l n="86">Vext with waste dreams ? for saving I be joined</l>
       <l n="87">To her that is the fairest under heaven ,</l>
       <l n="88">I seem as nothing in the mighty world ,</l>
       <l n="89">And cannot will my will , nor work my work</l>
       <l n="90">Wholly , nor make myself in mine own realm</l>
       <l n="91">Victor and lord . But were I joined with her ,</l>
       <l n="92">Then might we live together as one life ,</l>
       <l n="93">And reigning with one will in everything</l>
       <l n="94">Have power on this dark land to lighten it ,</l>
       <l n="95">And power on this dead world to make it live . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="96">Thereafter — as he speaks who tells the tale —</l>
       <l n="97">When Arthur reached a field-of-battle bright</l>
       <l n="98">With pitched pavilions of his foe , the world</l>
       <l n="99">Was all so clear about him , that he saw</l>
       <l n="100">The smallest rock far on the faintest hill ,</l>
       <l n="101">And even in high day the morning star .</l>
       <l n="102">So when the King had set his banner broad ,</l>
       <l n="103">At once from either side , with trumpet-blast ,</l>
       <l n="104">And shouts , and clarions shrilling unto blood ,</l>
       <l n="105">The long-lanced battle let their horses run .</l>
       <l n="106">And now the Barons and the kings prevailed ,</l>
       <l n="107">And now the King , as here and there that war</l>
       <l n="108">Went swaying ; but the Powers who walk the world</l>
       <l n="109">Made lightnings and great thunders over him ,</l>
       <l n="110">And dazed all eyes , till Arthur by main might ,</l>
       <l n="111">And mightier of his hands with every blow ,</l>
       <l n="112">And leading all his knighthood threw the kings</l>
       <l n="113">Carados , Urien , Cradlemont of Wales ,</l>
       <l n="114">Claudias , and Clariance of Northumberland ,</l>
       <l n="115">The King Brandagoras of Latangor ,</l>
       <l n="116">With Anguisant of Erin , Morganore ,</l>
       <l n="117">And Lot of Orkney . Then , before a voice</l>
       <l n="118">As dreadful as the shout of one who sees</l>
       <l n="119">To one who sins , and deems himself alone</l>
       <l n="120">And all the world asleep , they swerved and brake</l>
       <l n="121">Flying , and Arthur called to stay the brands</l>
       <l n="122">That hacked among the flyers , ‘ Ho ! they yield ! ’</l>
       <l n="123">So like a painted battle the war stood</l>
       <l n="124">Silenced , the living quiet as the dead ,</l>
       <l n="125">And in the heart of Arthur joy was lord .</l>
       <l n="126">He laughed upon his warrior whom he loved</l>
       <l n="127">And honoured most . ‘ Thou dost not doubt me King ,</l>
       <l n="128">So well thine arm hath wrought for me today . ’</l>
       <l n="129">‘ Sir and my liege , ’ he cried , ‘ the fire of God</l>
       <l n="130">Descends upon thee in the battle-field :</l>
       <l n="131">I know thee for my King ! ’ Whereat the two ,</l>
       <l n="132">For each had warded either in the fight ,</l>
       <l n="133">Sware on the field of death a deathless love .</l>
       <l n="134">And Arthur said , ‘ Man 's word is God in man :</l>
       <l n="135">Let chance what will , I trust thee to the death . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="136">Then quickly from the foughten field he sent</l>
       <l n="137">Ulfius , and Brastias , and Bedivere ,</l>
       <l n="138">His new-made knights , to King Leodogran ,</l>
       <l n="139">Saying , ‘ If I in aught have served thee well ,</l>
       <l n="140">Give me thy daughter Guinevere to wife . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="141">Whom when he heard , Leodogran in heart</l>
       <l n="142">Debating — ‘ How should I that am a king ,</l>
       <l n="143">However much he holp me at my need ,</l>
       <l n="144">Give my one daughter saving to a king ,</l>
       <l n="145">And a king 's son ? ’ — lifted his voice , and called</l>
       <l n="146">A hoary man , his chamberlain , to whom</l>
       <l n="147">He trusted all things , and of him required</l>
       <l n="148">His counsel : ‘ Knowest thou aught of Arthur 's birth ? ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="149">Then spake the hoary chamberlain and said ,</l>
       <l n="150">‘ Sir King , there be but two old men that know :</l>
       <l n="151">And each is twice as old as I ; and one</l>
       <l n="152">Is Merlin , the wise man that ever served</l>
       <l n="153">King Uther through his magic art ; and one</l>
       <l n="154">Is Merlin 's master ( so they call him ) Bleys ,</l>
       <l n="155">Who taught him magic , but the scholar ran</l>
       <l n="156">Before the master , and so far , that Bleys ,</l>
       <l n="157">Laid magic by , and sat him down , and wrote</l>
       <l n="158">All things and whatsoever Merlin did</l>
       <l n="159">In one great annal-book , where after-years</l>
       <l n="160">Will learn the secret of our Arthur 's birth . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="161">To whom the King Leodogran replied ,</l>
       <l n="162">‘ O friend , had I been holpen half as well</l>
       <l n="163">By this King Arthur as by thee today ,</l>
       <l n="164">Then beast and man had had their share of me :</l>
       <l n="165">But summon here before us yet once more</l>
       <l n="166">Ulfius , and Brastias , and Bedivere . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">

       <l n="208">So , when their feet were planted on the plain</l>

       <l n="240">Stretched under the cornice and upheld :</l>
       <l n="241">And drops of water fell from either hand ;</l>

       <l n="250">High on the top were those three Queens , the friends</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="24">
       <l n="252">Then those with Gareth for so long a space</l>

       <l n="259">Out of the city a blast of music pealed .</l>
       <l n="260">Back from the gate started the three , to whom</l>
       <l n="261">From out thereunder came an ancient man ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="26">
       <l n="263">Then Gareth , ‘ We be tillers of the soil ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="27">
       <l n="273">Then that old Seer made answer playing on him</l>

       <l n="1425">That Death was cast to ground , and slowly rose .</l>
       <l n="1426">But with one stroke Sir Gareth split the skull .</l>
       <l n="1427">Half fell to right and half to left and lay .</l>
       <l n="1428">Then with a stronger buffet he clove the helm</l>
       <l n="1429">As throughly as the skull ; and out from this</l>
       <l n="1430">Issued the bright face of a blooming boy</l>
       <l n="1431">Fresh as a flower new-born , and crying , ‘ Knight ,</l>
       <l n="1432">Slay me not : my three brethren bad me do it ,</l>
       <l n="1433">To make a horror all about the house ,</l>
       <l n="1434">And stay the world from Lady Lyonors .</l>
       <l n="1435">They never dreamed the passes would be past . ’</l>
       <l n="1436">Answered Sir Gareth graciously to one</l>
       <l n="1437">Not many a moon his younger , ‘ My fair child ,</l>
       <l n="1438">What madness made thee challenge the chief knight</l>
       <l n="1439">Of Arthur 's hall ? ’ ‘ Fair Sir , they bad me do it .</l>
       <l n="1440">They hate the King , and Lancelot , the King 's friend ,</l>

       <l n="1443">Then sprang the happier day from underground ;</l>

       <l n="1445">And revel and song , made merry over Death ,</l>
       <l n="1446">As being after all their foolish fears</l>
       <l n="1447">And horrors only proven a blooming boy .</l>
       <l n="1448">So large mirth lived and Gareth won the quest .</l>

       <l n="1455">Of that great Order of the Table Round ,</l>
       <l n="1456">Had married Enid , Yniol 's only child ,</l>
       <l n="1457">And loved her , as he loved the light of Heaven .</l>

       <l n="1459">At sunrise , now at sunset , now by night</l>
       <l n="1460">With moon and trembling stars , so loved Geraint</l>
       <l n="1461">To make her beauty vary day by day ,</l>
       <l n="1462">In crimsons and in purples and in gems .</l>
       <l n="1463">And Enid , but to please her husband 's eye ,</l>
       <l n="1464">Who first had found and loved her in a state</l>
       <l n="1465">Of broken fortunes , daily fronted him</l>
       <l n="1466">In some fresh splendour ; and the Queen herself ,</l>
       <l n="1467">Grateful to Prince Geraint for service done ,</l>
       <l n="1468">Loved her , and often with her own white hands</l>
       <l n="1469">Arrayed and decked her , as the loveliest ,</l>
       <l n="1470">Next after her own self , in all the court .</l>
       <l n="1471">And Enid loved the Queen , and with true heart</l>

       <l n="1473">And loveliest of all women upon earth .</l>
       <l n="1474">And seeing them so tender and so close ,</l>
       <l n="1475">Long in their common love rejoiced Geraint .</l>
       <l n="1476">But when a rumour rose about the Queen ,</l>
       <l n="1477">Touching her guilty love for Lancelot ,</l>
       <l n="1478">Though yet there lived no proof , nor yet was heard</l>
       <l n="1479">The world 's loud whisper breaking into storm ,</l>
       <l n="1480">Not less Geraint believed it ; and there fell</l>

       <l n="1483">Had suffered , or should suffer any taint</l>
       <l n="1484">In nature : wherefore going to the King ,</l>
       <l n="1485">He made this pretext , that his princedom lay</l>
       <l n="1486">Close on the borders of a territory ,</l>
       <l n="1487">Wherein were bandit earls , and caitiff knights ,</l>
       <l n="1488">Assassins , and all flyers from the hand</l>
       <l n="1489">Of Justice , and whatever loathes a law :</l>
       <l n="1490">And therefore , till the King himself should please</l>
       <l n="1491">To cleanse this common sewer of all his realm ,</l>
       <l n="1492">He craved a fair permission to depart ,</l>
       <l n="1493">And there defend his marches ; and the King</l>
       <l n="1494">Mused for a little on his plea , but , last ,</l>
       <l n="1495">Allowing it , the Prince and Enid rode ,</l>
       <l n="1496">And fifty knights rode with them , to the shores</l>
       <l n="1497">Of Severn , and they past to their own land ;</l>
       <l n="1498">Where , thinking , that if ever yet was wife</l>
       <l n="1499">True to her lord , mine shall be so to me ,</l>
       <l n="1500">He compassed her with sweet observances</l>
       <l n="1501">And worship , never leaving her , and grew</l>
       <l n="1502">Forgetful of his promise to the King ,</l>
       <l n="1503">Forgetful of the falcon and the hunt ,</l>
       <l n="1504">Forgetful of the tilt and tournament ,</l>
       <l n="1505">Forgetful of his glory and his name ,</l>
       <l n="1506">Forgetful of his princedom and its cares .</l>
       <l n="1507">And this forgetfulness was hateful to her .</l>
       <l n="1508">And by and by the people , when they met</l>
       <l n="1509">In twos and threes , or fuller companies ,</l>
       <l n="1510">Began to scoff and jeer and babble of him</l>
       <l n="1511">As of a prince whose manhood was all gone ,</l>
       <l n="1512">And molten down in mere uxoriousness .</l>
       <l n="1513">And this she gathered from the people 's eyes :</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="142">
       <l n="1521">At last , it chanced that on a summer morn</l>

       <l n="1525">Who , moving , cast the coverlet aside ,</l>
       <l n="1526">And bared the knotted column of his throat ,</l>
       <l n="1527">The massive square of his heroic breast ,</l>
       <l n="1528">And arms on which the standing muscle sloped ,</l>
       <l n="1529">As slopes a wild brook o'er a little stone ,</l>
       <l n="1530">Running too vehemently to break upon it .</l>
       <l n="1531">And Enid woke and sat beside the couch ,</l>

       <l n="1563">True tears upon his broad and naked breast ,</l>
       <l n="1564">And these awoke him , and by great mischance</l>

       <l n="1683">Will clothe her for her bridals like the sun . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="149">
       <l n="1684">And Prince Geraint , now thinking that he heard</l>
       <l n="1685">The noble hart at bay , now the far horn ,</l>
       <l n="1686">A little vext at losing of the hunt ,</l>
       <l n="1687">A little at the vile occasion , rode ,</l>
       <l n="1688">By ups and downs , through many a grassy glade</l>
       <l n="1689">And valley , with fixt eye following the three .</l>
       <l n="1690">At last they issued from the world of wood ,</l>
       <l n="1691">And climbed upon a fair and even ridge ,</l>
       <l n="1692">And showed themselves against the sky , and sank .</l>
       <l n="1693">And thither there came Geraint , and underneath</l>
       <l n="1694">Beheld the long street of a little town</l>
       <l n="1695">In a long valley , on one side whereof ,</l>
       <l n="1696">White from the mason 's hand , a fortress rose ;</l>
       <l n="1697">And on one side a castle in decay ,</l>
       <l n="1698">Beyond a bridge that spanned a dry ravine :</l>
       <l n="1699">And out of town and valley came a noise</l>
       <l n="1700">As of a broad brook o'er a shingly bed</l>
       <l n="1701">Brawling , or like a clamour of the rooks</l>
       <l n="1702">At distance , ere they settle for the night .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="150">
       <l n="1703">And onward to the fortress rode the three ,</l>
       <l n="1704">And entered , and were lost behind the walls .</l>
       <l n="1705">‘ So , ’ thought Geraint , ‘ I have tracked him to his earth . ’</l>
       <l n="1706">And down the long street riding wearily ,</l>
       <l n="1707">Found every hostel full , and everywhere</l>
       <l n="1708">Was hammer laid to hoof , and the hot hiss</l>
       <l n="1709">And bustling whistle of the youth who scoured</l>
       <l n="1710">His master 's armour ; and of such a one</l>
       <l n="1711">He asked , ‘ What means the tumult in the town ? ’</l>
       <l n="1712">Who told him , scouring still , ‘ The sparrow-hawk ! ’</l>
       <l n="1713">Then riding close behind an ancient churl ,</l>
       <l n="1714">Who , smitten by the dusty sloping beam ,</l>
       <l n="1715">Went sweating underneath a sack of corn ,</l>
       <l n="1716">Asked yet once more what meant the hubbub here ?</l>
       <l n="1717">Who answered gruffly , ‘ Ugh ! the sparrow-hawk . ’</l>
       <l n="1718">Then riding further past an armourer 's ,</l>
       <l n="1719">Who , with back turned , and bowed above his work ,</l>
       <l n="1720">Sat riveting a helmet on his knee ,</l>
       <l n="1721">He put the self-same query , but the man</l>
       <l n="1722">Not turning round , nor looking at him , said :</l>
       <l n="1723">‘ Friend , he that labours for the sparrow-hawk</l>
       <l n="1724">Has little time for idle questioners . ’</l>
       <l n="1725">Whereat Geraint flashed into sudden spleen :</l>
       <l n="1726">‘ A thousand pips eat up your sparrow-hawk !</l>
       <l n="1727">Tits , wrens , and all winged nothings peck him dead !</l>
       <l n="1728">Ye think the rustic cackle of your bourg</l>
       <l n="1729">The murmur of the world ! What is it to me ?</l>
       <l n="1730">O wretched set of sparrows , one and all ,</l>
       <l n="1731">Who pipe of nothing but of sparrow-hawks !</l>
       <l n="1732">Speak , if ye be not like the rest , hawk-mad ,</l>
       <l n="1733">Where can I get me harbourage for the night ?</l>
       <l n="1734">And arms , arms , arms to fight my enemy ? Speak ! ’</l>
       <l n="1735">Whereat the armourer turning all amazed</l>
       <l n="1736">And seeing one so gay in purple silks ,</l>
       <l n="1737">Came forward with the helmet yet in hand</l>
       <l n="1738">And answered , ‘ Pardon me , O stranger knight ;</l>
       <l n="1739">We hold a tourney here tomorrow morn ,</l>
       <l n="1740">And there is scantly time for half the work .</l>
       <l n="1741">Arms ? truth ! I know not : all are wanted here .</l>
       <l n="1742">Harbourage ? truth , good truth , I know not , save ,</l>
       <l n="1743">It may be , at Earl Yniol 's , o'er the bridge</l>
       <l n="1744">Yonder . ’ He spoke and fell to work again .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="151">
       <l n="1745">Then rode Geraint , a little spleenful yet ,</l>
       <l n="1746">Across the bridge that spanned the dry ravine .</l>
       <l n="1747">There musing sat the hoary-headed Earl ,</l>
       <l n="1748">( His dress a suit of frayed magnificence ,</l>
       <l n="1749">Once fit for feasts of ceremony ) and said :</l>
       <l n="1750">‘ Whither , fair son ? ’ to whom Geraint replied ,</l>
       <l n="1751">‘ O friend , I seek a harbourage for the night . ’</l>
       <l n="1752">Then Yniol , ‘ Enter therefore and partake</l>
       <l n="1753">The slender entertainment of a house</l>
       <l n="1754">Once rich , now poor , but ever open-doored . ’</l>
       <l n="1755">‘ Thanks , venerable friend , ’ replied Geraint ;</l>
       <l n="1756">‘ So that ye do not serve me sparrow-hawks</l>
       <l n="1757">For supper , I will enter , I will eat</l>
       <l n="1758">With all the passion of a twelve hours ’ fast . ’</l>
       <l n="1759">Then sighed and smiled the hoary-headed Earl ,</l>
       <l n="1760">And answered , ‘ Graver cause than yours is mine</l>
       <l n="1761">To curse this hedgerow thief , the sparrow-hawk :</l>
       <l n="1762">But in , go in ; for save yourself desire it ,</l>
       <l n="1763">We will not touch upon him even in jest . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="152">
       <l n="1764">Then rode Geraint into the castle court ,</l>
       <l n="1765">His charger trampling many a prickly star</l>
       <l n="1766">Of sprouted thistle on the broken stones .</l>
       <l n="1767">He looked and saw that all was ruinous .</l>
       <l n="1768">Here stood a shattered archway plumed with fern ;</l>
       <l n="1769">And here had fallen a great part of a tower ,</l>
       <l n="1770">Whole , like a crag that tumbles from the cliff ,</l>
       <l n="1771">And like a crag was gay with wilding flowers :</l>
       <l n="1772">And high above a piece of turret stair ,</l>
       <l n="1773">Worn by the feet that now were silent , wound</l>
       <l n="1774">Bare to the sun , and monstrous ivy-stems</l>
       <l n="1775">Claspt the gray walls with hairy-fibred arms ,</l>
       <l n="1776">And sucked the joining of the stones , and looked</l>
       <l n="1777">A knot , beneath , of snakes , aloft , a grove .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="153">
       <l n="1778">And while he waited in the castle court ,</l>
       <l n="1779">The voice of Enid , Yniol 's daughter , rang</l>
       <l n="1780">Clear through the open casement of the hall ,</l>
       <l n="1781">Singing ; and as the sweet voice of a bird ,</l>
       <l n="1782">Heard by the lander in a lonely isle ,</l>
       <l n="1783">Moves him to think what kind of bird it is</l>
       <l n="1784">That sings so delicately clear , and make</l>
       <l n="1785">Conjecture of the plumage and the form ;</l>
       <l n="1786">So the sweet voice of Enid moved Geraint ;</l>
       <l n="1787">And made him like a man abroad at morn</l>
       <l n="1788">When first the liquid note beloved of men</l>
       <l n="1789">Comes flying over many a windy wave</l>
       <l n="1790">To Britain , and in April suddenly</l>
       <l n="1791">Breaks from a coppice gemmed with green and red ,</l>
       <l n="1792">And he suspends his converse with a friend ,</l>
       <l n="1793">Or it may be the labour of his hands ,</l>
       <l n="1794">To think or say , ‘ There is the nightingale ; ’</l>
       <l n="1795">So fared it with Geraint , who thought and said ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="154">
       <l n="1797">It chanced the song that Enid sang was one</l>

       <l n="1813">Right o'er a mount of newly-fallen stones ,</l>
       <l n="1814">The dusky-raftered many-cobwebbed hall ,</l>
       <l n="1815">He found an ancient dame in dim brocade ;</l>
       <l n="1816">And near her , like a blossom vermeil-white ,</l>
       <l n="1817">That lightly breaks a faded flower-sheath ,</l>
       <l n="1818">Moved the fair Enid , all in faded silk ,</l>

       <l n="1820">‘ Here by God 's rood is the one maid for me . ’</l>
       <l n="1821">But none spake word except the hoary Earl :</l>
       <l n="1822">‘ Enid , the good knight 's horse stands in the court ;</l>
       <l n="1823">Take him to stall , and give him corn , and then</l>
       <l n="1824">Go to the town and buy us flesh and wine ;</l>
       <l n="1825">And we will make us merry as we may .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="160">
       <l n="1827">He spake : the Prince , as Enid past him , fain</l>
       <l n="1828">To follow , strode a stride , but Yniol caught</l>
       <l n="1829">His purple scarf , and held , and said , ‘ Forbear !</l>
       <l n="1830">Rest ! the good house , though ruined , O my son ,</l>

       <l n="1832">And reverencing the custom of the house</l>
       <l n="1833">Geraint , from utter courtesy , forbore .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="161">
       <l n="1834">So Enid took his charger to the stall ;</l>
       <l n="1835">And after went her way across the bridge ,</l>
       <l n="1836">And reached the town , and while the Prince and Earl</l>
       <l n="1837">Yet spoke together , came again with one ,</l>
       <l n="1838">A youth , that following with a costrel bore</l>
       <l n="1839">The means of goodly welcome , flesh and wine .</l>

       <l n="1842">And then , because their hall must also serve</l>
       <l n="1843">For kitchen , boiled the flesh , and spread the board ,</l>
       <l n="1844">And stood behind , and waited on the three .</l>
       <l n="1845">And seeing her so sweet and serviceable ,</l>
       <l n="1846">Geraint had longing in him evermore</l>

       <l n="1908">Through open doors and hospitality ;</l>

       <l n="2042">Is broken down , for Enid sees my fall ! ’</l>
       <l n="2043">And rising up , he rode to Arthur 's court ,</l>
       <l n="2044">And there the Queen forgave him easily .</l>

       <l n="2252">Or whether some false sense in her own self</l>
       <l n="2253">Of my contrasting brightness , overbore</l>
       <l n="2254">Her fancy dwelling in this dusky hall ;</l>
       <l n="2255">And such a sense might make her long for court</l>
       <l n="2256">And all its perilous glories : and I thought ,</l>
       <l n="2257">That could I someway prove such force in her</l>
       <l n="2258">Linked with such love for me , that at a word</l>

       <l n="2697">Low-spoken , and of so few words , and seemed</l>
       <l n="2698">So justified by that necessity ,</l>
       <l n="2699">That though he thought ‘ was it for him she wept</l>
       <l n="2700">In Devon ? ’ he but gave a wrathful groan ,</l>
       <l n="2701">Saying , ‘ Your sweet faces make good fellows fools</l>
       <l n="2702">And traitors . Call the host and bid him bring</l>
       <l n="2703">Charger and palfrey . ’ So she glided out</l>
       <l n="2704">Among the heavy breathings of the house ,</l>
       <l n="2705">And like a household Spirit at the walls</l>
       <l n="2706">Beat , till she woke the sleepers , and returned :</l>
       <l n="2707">Then tending her rough lord , though all unasked ,</l>
       <l n="2708">In silence , did him service as a squire ;</l>
       <l n="2709">Till issuing armed he found the host and cried ,</l>
       <l n="2710">‘ Thy reckoning , friend ? ’ and ere he learnt it , ‘ Take</l>
       <l n="2711">Five horses and their armours ; ’ and the host</l>
       <l n="2712">Suddenly honest , answered in amaze ,</l>
       <l n="2713">‘ My lord , I scarce have spent the worth of one ! ’</l>
       <l n="2714">‘ Ye will be all the wealthier , ’ said the Prince ,</l>
       <l n="2715">And then to Enid , ‘ Forward ! and today</l>
       <l n="2716">I charge you , Enid , more especially ,</l>
       <l n="2717">What thing soever ye may hear , or see ,</l>
       <l n="2718">Or fancy ( though I count it of small use</l>
       <l n="2719">To charge you ) that ye speak not but obey . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="209">
       <l n="2720">And Enid answered , ‘ Yea , my lord , I know</l>
       <l n="2721">Your wish , and would obey ; but riding first ,</l>
       <l n="2722">I hear the violent threats you do not hear ,</l>
       <l n="2723">I see the danger which you cannot see :</l>
       <l n="2724">Then not to give you warning , that seems hard ;</l>
       <l n="2725">Almost beyond me : yet I would obey . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="210">
       <l n="2726">‘ Yea so , ’ said he , ‘ do it : be not too wise ;</l>
       <l n="2727">Seeing that ye are wedded to a man ,</l>
       <l n="2728">Not all mismated with a yawning clown ,</l>
       <l n="2729">But one with arms to guard his head and yours ,</l>
       <l n="2730">With eyes to find you out however far ,</l>
       <l n="2731">And ears to hear you even in his dreams . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="211">
       <l n="2732">With that he turned and looked as keenly at her</l>
       <l n="2733">As careful robins eye the delver 's toil ;</l>
       <l n="2734">And that within her , which a wanton fool ,</l>
       <l n="2735">Or hasty judger would have called her guilt ,</l>
       <l n="2736">Made her cheek burn and either eyelid fall .</l>
       <l n="2737">And Geraint looked and was not satisfied .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="212">
       <l n="2738">Then forward by a way which , beaten broad ,</l>
       <l n="2739">Led from the territory of false Limours</l>
       <l n="2740">To the waste earldom of another earl ,</l>
       <l n="2741">Doorm , whom his shaking vassals called the Bull ,</l>
       <l n="2742">Went Enid with her sullen follower on .</l>
       <l n="2743">Once she looked back , and when she saw him ride</l>
       <l n="2744">More near by many a rood than yestermorn ,</l>
       <l n="2745">It wellnigh made her cheerful ; till Geraint</l>
       <l n="2746">Waving an angry hand as who should say</l>
       <l n="2747">‘ Ye watch me , ’ saddened all her heart again .</l>
       <l n="2748">But while the sun yet beat a dewy blade ,</l>
       <l n="2749">The sound of many a heavily-galloping hoof</l>
       <l n="2750">Smote on her ear , and turning round she saw</l>
       <l n="2751">Dust , and the points of lances bicker in it .</l>
       <l n="2752">Then not to disobey her lord 's behest ,</l>
       <l n="2753">And yet to give him warning , for he rode</l>
       <l n="2754">As if he heard not , moving back she held</l>
       <l n="2755">Her finger up , and pointed to the dust .</l>
       <l n="2756">At which the warrior in his obstinacy ,</l>
       <l n="2757">Because she kept the letter of his word ,</l>
       <l n="2758">Was in a manner pleased , and turning , stood .</l>
       <l n="2759">And in the moment after , wild Limours ,</l>
       <l n="2760">Borne on a black horse , like a thunder-cloud</l>
       <l n="2761">Whose skirts are loosened by the breaking storm ,</l>
       <l n="2762">Half ridden off with by the thing he rode ,</l>
       <l n="2763">And all in passion uttering a dry shriek ,</l>
       <l n="2764">Dashed down on Geraint , who closed with him , and bore</l>
       <l n="2765">Down by the length of lance and arm beyond</l>
       <l n="2766">The crupper , and so left him stunned or dead ,</l>
       <l n="2767">And overthrew the next that followed him ,</l>
       <l n="2768">And blindly rushed on all the rout behind .</l>
       <l n="2769">But at the flash and motion of the man</l>
       <l n="2770">They vanished panic-stricken , like a shoal</l>
       <l n="2771">Of darting fish , that on a summer morn</l>
       <l n="2772">Adown the crystal dykes at Camelot</l>
       <l n="2773">Come slipping o'er their shadows on the sand ,</l>
       <l n="2774">But if a man who stands upon the brink</l>
       <l n="2775">But lift a shining hand against the sun ,</l>
       <l n="2776">There is not left the twinkle of a fin</l>
       <l n="2777">Betwixt the cressy islets white in flower ;</l>
       <l n="2778">So , scared but at the motion of the man ,</l>
       <l n="2779">Fled all the boon companions of the Earl ,</l>
       <l n="2780">And left him lying in the public way ;</l>
       <l n="2781">So vanish friendships only made in wine .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="213">
       <l n="2782">Then like a stormy sunlight smiled Geraint ,</l>
       <l n="2783">Who saw the chargers of the two that fell</l>
       <l n="2784">Start from their fallen lords , and wildly fly ,</l>
       <l n="2785">Mixt with the flyers . ‘ Horse and man , ’ he said ,</l>
       <l n="2786">‘ All of one mind and all right-honest friends !</l>
       <l n="2787">Not a hoof left : and I methinks till now</l>
       <l n="2788">Was honest — paid with horses and with arms ;</l>
       <l n="2789">I cannot steal or plunder , no nor beg :</l>
       <l n="2790">And so what say ye , shall we strip him there</l>
       <l n="2791">Your lover ? has your palfrey heart enough</l>
       <l n="2792">To bear his armour ? shall we fast , or dine ?</l>
       <l n="2793">No ?— then do thou , being right honest , pray</l>
       <l n="2794">That we may meet the horsemen of Earl Doorm ,</l>
       <l n="2795">I too would still be honest . ’ Thus he said :</l>
       <l n="2796">And sadly gazing on her bridle-reins ,</l>
       <l n="2797">And answering not one word , she led the way .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="214">
       <l n="2798">But as a man to whom a dreadful loss</l>

       <l n="2804">Bled underneath his armour secretly ,</l>
       <l n="2805">And so rode on , nor told his gentle wife</l>

       <l n="2807">Till his eye darkened and his helmet wagged ;</l>

       <l n="2813">Dismounting , loosed the fastenings of his arms ,</l>
       <l n="2814">Nor let her true hand falter , nor blue eye</l>
       <l n="2815">Moisten , till she had lighted on his wound ,</l>
       <l n="2816">And tearing off her veil of faded silk</l>

       <l n="2822">And many past , but none regarded her ,</l>

       <l n="2825">Was cared as much for as a summer shower :</l>

       <l n="2832">Another , flying from the wrath of Doorm</l>
       <l n="2833">Before an ever-fancied arrow , made</l>
       <l n="2834">The long way smoke beneath him in his fear ;</l>
       <l n="2835">At which her palfrey whinnying lifted heel ,</l>
       <l n="2836">And scoured into the coppices and was lost ,</l>
       <l n="2837">While the great charger stood , grieved like a man .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="217">
       <l n="2838">But at the point of noon the huge Earl Doorm ,</l>

       <l n="2842">But ere he came , like one that hails a ship ,</l>

       <l n="2859">He spake , and past away ,</l>
       <l n="2860">But left two brawny spearmen , who advanced ,</l>

       <l n="2867">Their chance of booty from the morning 's raid ,</l>

       <l n="2869">Such as they brought upon their forays out</l>
       <l n="2870">For those that might be wounded ; laid him on it</l>
       <l n="2871">All in the hollow of his shield , and took</l>

       <l n="2877">Their luckier mates , but growling as before ,</l>

       <l n="2902">Struck with a knife 's haft hard against the board ,</l>
       <l n="2903">And called for flesh and wine to feed his spears .</l>
       <l n="2904">And men brought in whole hogs and quarter beeves ,</l>

       <l n="4459">Hath earnest in it of far springs to be .</l>
       <l n="4460">A tawny pirate anchored in his port ,</l>
       <l n="4461">Whose bark had plundered twenty nameless isles ;</l>
       <l n="4462">And passing one , at the high peep of dawn ,</l>
       <l n="4463">He saw two cities in a thousand boats</l>
       <l n="4464">All fighting for a woman on the sea .</l>
       <l n="4465">And pushing his black craft among them all ,</l>
       <l n="4466">He lightly scattered theirs and brought her off ,</l>
       <l n="4467">With loss of half his people arrow-slain ;</l>
       <l n="4468">A maid so smooth , so white , so wonderful ,</l>
       <l n="4469">They said a light came from her when she moved :</l>

       <l n="4471">The King impaled him for his piracy ;</l>
       <l n="4472">Then made her Queen : but those isle-nurtured eyes</l>
       <l n="4473">Waged such unwilling though successful war</l>
       <l n="4474">On all the youth , they sickened ; councils thinned ,</l>
       <l n="4475">And armies waned , for magnet-like she drew</l>
       <l n="4476">The rustiest iron of old fighters ’ hearts ;</l>

       <l n="4478">Unbidden , and the brutes of mountain back</l>
       <l n="4479">That carry kings in castles , bowed black knees</l>
       <l n="4480">Of homage , ringing with their serpent hands ,</l>
       <l n="4481">To make her smile , her golden ankle-bells .</l>
       <l n="4482">What wonder , being jealous , that he sent</l>
       <l n="4483">His horns of proclamation out through all</l>
       <l n="4484">The hundred under-kingdoms that he swayed</l>
       <l n="4485">To find a wizard who might teach the King</l>
       <l n="4486">Some charm , which being wrought upon the Queen</l>
       <l n="4487">Might keep her all his own : to such a one</l>
       <l n="4488">He promised more than ever king has given ,</l>
       <l n="4489">A league of mountain full of golden mines ,</l>
       <l n="4490">A province with a hundred miles of coast ,</l>
       <l n="4491">A palace and a princess , all for him :</l>
       <l n="4492">But on all those who tried and failed , the King</l>
       <l n="4493">Pronounced a dismal sentence , meaning by it</l>

       <l n="4495">Or like a king , not to be trifled with —</l>

       <l n="4497">And many tried and failed , because the charm</l>
       <l n="4498">Of nature in her overbore their own :</l>
       <l n="4499">And many a wizard brow bleached on the walls :</l>
       <l n="4500">And many weeks a troop of carrion crows</l>

       <l n="4534">And learnt their elemental secrets , powers</l>
       <l n="4535">And forces ; often o'er the sun 's bright eye</l>
       <l n="4536">Drew the vast eyelid of an inky cloud ,</l>

       <l n="4539">When the lake whitened and the pinewood roared ,</l>

       <l n="4541">The world to peace again : here was the man .</l>
       <l n="4542">And so by force they dragged him to the King .</l>

       <l n="5216">Of noble things , and held her from her sleep .</l>
       <l n="5217">Till rathe she rose , half-cheated in the thought</l>
       <l n="5218">She needs must bid farewell to sweet Lavaine .</l>
       <l n="5219">First in fear , step after step , she stole</l>
       <l n="5220">Down the long tower-stairs , hesitating :</l>
       <l n="5221">Anon , she heard Sir Lancelot cry in the court ,</l>
       <l n="5222">‘ This shield , my friend , where is it ? ’ and Lavaine</l>
       <l n="5223">Past inward , as she came from out the tower .</l>
       <l n="5224">There to his proud horse Lancelot turned , and smoothed</l>
       <l n="5225">The glossy shoulder , humming to himself .</l>
       <l n="5226">Half-envious of the flattering hand , she drew</l>
       <l n="5227">Nearer and stood . He looked , and more amazed</l>
       <l n="5228">Than if seven men had set upon him , saw</l>
       <l n="5229">The maiden standing in the dewy light .</l>
       <l n="5230">He had not dreamed she was so beautiful .</l>
       <l n="5231">Then came on him a sort of sacred fear ,</l>
       <l n="5232">For silent , though he greeted her , she stood</l>
       <l n="5233">Rapt on his face as if it were a God 's .</l>
       <l n="5234">Suddenly flashed on her a wild desire ,</l>
       <l n="5235">That he should wear her favour at the tilt .</l>
       <l n="5236">She braved a riotous heart in asking for it .</l>
       <l n="5237">‘ Fair lord , whose name I know not — noble it is ,</l>
       <l n="5238">I well believe , the noblest — will you wear</l>
       <l n="5239">My favour at this tourney ? ’ ‘ Nay , ’ said he ,</l>
       <l n="5240">‘ Fair lady , since I never yet have worn</l>
       <l n="5241">Favour of any lady in the lists .</l>
       <l n="5242">Such is my wont , as those , who know me , know . ’</l>
       <l n="5243">‘ Yea , so , ’ she answered ; ‘ then in wearing mine</l>
       <l n="5244">Needs must be lesser likelihood , noble lord ,</l>
       <l n="5245">That those who know should know you . ’ And he turned</l>
       <l n="5246">Her counsel up and down within his mind ,</l>
       <l n="5247">And found it true , and answered , ‘ True , my child .</l>
       <l n="5248">Well , I will wear it : fetch it out to me :</l>
       <l n="5249">What is it ? ’ and she told him ‘ A red sleeve</l>
       <l n="5250">Broidered with pearls , ’ and brought it : then he bound</l>
       <l n="5251">Her token on his helmet , with a smile</l>
       <l n="5252">Saying , ‘ I never yet have done so much</l>
       <l n="5253">For any maiden living , ’ and the blood</l>
       <l n="5254">Sprang to her face and filled her with delight ;</l>
       <l n="5255">But left her all the paler , when Lavaine</l>
       <l n="5256">Returning brought the yet-unblazoned shield ,</l>
       <l n="5257">His brother 's ; which he gave to Lancelot ,</l>
       <l n="5258">Who parted with his own to fair Elaine :</l>
       <l n="5259">‘ Do me this grace , my child , to have my shield</l>
       <l n="5260">In keeping till I come . ’ ‘ A grace to me , ’</l>
       <l n="5261">She answered , ‘ twice today . I am your squire ! ’</l>
       <l n="5262">Whereat Lavaine said , laughing , ‘ Lily maid ,</l>
       <l n="5263">For fear our people call you lily maid</l>
       <l n="5264">In earnest , let me bring your colour back ;</l>
       <l n="5265">Once , twice , and thrice : now get you hence to bed : ’</l>
       <l n="5266">So kissed her , and Sir Lancelot his own hand ,</l>
       <l n="5267">And thus they moved away : she stayed a minute ,</l>
       <l n="5268">Then made a sudden step to the gate , and there —</l>
       <l n="5269">Her bright hair blown about the serious face</l>
       <l n="5270">Yet rosy-kindled with her brother 's kiss —</l>
       <l n="5271">Paused by the gateway , standing near the shield</l>
       <l n="5272">In silence , while she watched their arms far-off</l>
       <l n="5273">Sparkle , until they dipt below the downs .</l>
       <l n="5274">Then to her tower she climbed , and took the shield ,</l>
       <l n="5275">There kept it , and so lived in fantasy .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="371">
       <l n="5276">Meanwhile the new companions past away</l>
       <l n="5277">Far o'er the long backs of the bushless downs ,</l>
       <l n="5278">To where Sir Lancelot knew there lived a knight</l>
       <l n="5279">Not far from Camelot , now for forty years</l>
       <l n="5280">A hermit , who had prayed , laboured and prayed ,</l>
       <l n="5281">And ever labouring had scooped himself</l>
       <l n="5282">In the white rock a chapel and a hall</l>
       <l n="5283">On massive columns , like a shorecliff cave ,</l>
       <l n="5284">And cells and chambers : all were fair and dry ;</l>
       <l n="5285">The green light from the meadows underneath</l>
       <l n="5286">Struck up and lived along the milky roofs ;</l>
       <l n="5287">And in the meadows tremulous aspen-trees</l>
       <l n="5288">And poplars made a noise of falling showers .</l>
       <l n="5289">And thither wending there that night they bode .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="372">
       <l n="5290">But when the next day broke from underground ,</l>
       <l n="5291">And shot red fire and shadows through the cave ,</l>
       <l n="5292">They rose , heard mass , broke fast , and rode away :</l>
       <l n="5293">Then Lancelot saying , ‘ Hear , but hold my name</l>
       <l n="5294">Hidden , you ride with Lancelot of the Lake , ’</l>
       <l n="5295">Abashed young Lavaine , whose instant reverence ,</l>
       <l n="5296">Dearer to true young hearts than their own praise ,</l>
       <l n="5297">But left him leave to stammer , ‘ Is it indeed ? ’</l>
       <l n="5298">And after muttering ‘ The great Lancelot ,</l>
       <l n="5299">At last he got his breath and answered , ‘ One ,</l>
       <l n="5300">One have I seen — that other , our liege lord ,</l>
       <l n="5301">The dread Pendragon , Britain 's King of kings ,</l>
       <l n="5302">Of whom the people talk mysteriously ,</l>
       <l n="5303">He will be there — then were I stricken blind</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="373">
       <l n="5305">So spake Lavaine , and when they reached the lists</l>
       <l n="5306">By Camelot in the meadow , let his eyes</l>
       <l n="5307">Run through the peopled gallery which half round</l>
       <l n="5308">Lay like a rainbow fallen upon the grass ,</l>
       <l n="5309">Until they found the clear-faced King , who sat</l>
       <l n="5310">Robed in red samite , easily to be known ,</l>
       <l n="5311">Since to his crown the golden dragon clung ,</l>
       <l n="5312">And down his robe the dragon writhed in gold ,</l>
       <l n="5313">And from the carven-work behind him crept</l>
       <l n="5314">Two dragons gilded , sloping down to make</l>
       <l n="5315">Arms for his chair , while all the rest of them</l>
       <l n="5316">Through knots and loops and folds innumerable</l>
       <l n="5317">Fled ever through the woodwork , till they found</l>
       <l n="5318">The new design wherein they lost themselves ,</l>
       <l n="5319">Yet with all ease , so tender was the work :</l>
       <l n="5320">And , in the costly canopy o'er him set ,</l>
       <l n="5321">Blazed the last diamond of the nameless king .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="374">
       <l n="5322">Then Lancelot answered young Lavaine and said ,</l>
       <l n="5323">‘ Me you call great : mine is the firmer seat ,</l>
       <l n="5324">The truer lance : but there is many a youth</l>
       <l n="5325">Now crescent , who will come to all I am</l>
       <l n="5326">And overcome it ; and in me there dwells</l>
       <l n="5327">No greatness , save it be some far-off touch</l>
       <l n="5328">Of greatness to know well I am not great :</l>
       <l n="5329">There is the man . ’ And Lavaine gaped upon him</l>
       <l n="5330">As on a thing miraculous , and anon</l>
       <l n="5331">The trumpets blew ; and then did either side ,</l>
       <l n="5332">They that assailed , and they that held the lists ,</l>
       <l n="5333">Set lance in rest , strike spur , suddenly move ,</l>
       <l n="5334">Meet in the midst , and there so furiously</l>
       <l n="5335">Shock , that a man far-off might well perceive ,</l>
       <l n="5336">If any man that day were left afield ,</l>
       <l n="5337">The hard earth shake , and a low thunder of arms .</l>
       <l n="5338">And Lancelot bode a little , till he saw</l>
       <l n="5339">Which were the weaker ; then he hurled into it</l>
       <l n="5340">Against the stronger : little need to speak</l>
       <l n="5341">Of Lancelot in his glory ! King , duke , earl ,</l>
       <l n="5342">Count , baron — whom he smote , he overthrew .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="375">
       <l n="5343">But in the field were Lancelot 's kith and kin ,</l>
       <l n="5344">Ranged with the Table Round that held the lists ,</l>
       <l n="5345">Strong men , and wrathful that a stranger knight</l>
       <l n="5346">Should do and almost overdo the deeds</l>
       <l n="5347">Of Lancelot ; and one said to the other , ‘ Lo !</l>

       <l n="5349">The grace and versatility of the man !</l>
       <l n="5350">Is it not Lancelot ? ’ ‘ When has Lancelot worn</l>
       <l n="5351">Favour of any lady in the lists ?</l>
       <l n="5352">Not such his wont , as we , that know him , know . ’</l>
       <l n="5353">‘ How then ? who then ? ’ a fury seized them all ,</l>
       <l n="5354">A fiery family passion for the name</l>
       <l n="5355">Of Lancelot , and a glory one with theirs .</l>
       <l n="5356">They couched their spears and pricked their steeds , and thus ,</l>
       <l n="5357">Their plumes driven backward by the wind they made</l>
       <l n="5358">In moving , all together down upon him</l>
       <l n="5359">Bare , as a wild wave in the wide North-sea ,</l>

       <l n="5362">Down on a bark , and overbears the bark ,</l>

       <l n="5364">Sir Lancelot and his charger , and a spear</l>
       <l n="5365">Down-glancing lamed the charger , and a spear</l>
       <l n="5366">Pricked sharply his own cuirass , and the head</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="376">
       <l n="5368">Then Sir Lavaine did well and worshipfully ;</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="377">
       <l n="5385">He spoke , and vanished suddenly from the field</l>

       <l n="5470">Might well have kept his secret . True , indeed ,</l>
       <l n="5471">Albeit I know my knights fantastical ,</l>
       <l n="5472">So fine a fear in our large Lancelot</l>
       <l n="5473">Must needs have moved my laughter : now remains</l>
       <l n="5474">But little cause for laughter : his own kin —</l>
       <l n="5475">Ill news , my Queen , for all who love him , this !—</l>
       <l n="5476">His kith and kin , not knowing , set upon him ;</l>
       <l n="5477">So that he went sore wounded from the field :</l>
       <l n="5478">Yet good news too : for goodly hopes are mine</l>
       <l n="5479">That Lancelot is no more a lonely heart .</l>
       <l n="5480">He wore , against his wont , upon his helm</l>
       <l n="5481">A sleeve of scarlet , broidered with great pearls ,</l>
       <l n="5482">Some gentle maiden 's gift . ’</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="382">
       <l n="5483">‘ Yea , lord , ’ she said ,</l>
       <l n="5484">‘ Thy hopes are mine , ’ and saying that , she choked ,</l>
       <l n="5485">And sharply turned about to hide her face ,</l>
       <l n="5486">Past to her chamber , and there flung herself</l>
       <l n="5487">Down on the great King 's couch , and writhed upon it ,</l>
       <l n="5488">And clenched her fingers till they bit the palm ,</l>
       <l n="5489">And shrieked out ‘ Traitor ’ to the unhearing wall ,</l>
       <l n="5490">Then flashed into wild tears , and rose again ,</l>
       <l n="5491">And moved about her palace , proud and pale .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="383">
       <l n="5492">Gawain the while through all the region round</l>
       <l n="5493">Rode with his diamond , wearied of the quest ,</l>
       <l n="5494">Touched at all points , except the poplar grove ,</l>
       <l n="5495">And came at last , though late , to Astolat :</l>
       <l n="5496">Whom glittering in enamelled arms the maid</l>
       <l n="5497">Glanced at , and cried , ‘ What news from Camelot , lord ?</l>
       <l n="5498">What of the knight with the red sleeve ? ’ ‘ He won . ’</l>
       <l n="5499">‘ I knew it , ’ she said . ‘ But parted from the jousts</l>
       <l n="5500">Hurt in the side , ’ whereat she caught her breath ;</l>
       <l n="5501">Through her own side she felt the sharp lance go ;</l>
       <l n="5502">Thereon she smote her hand : wellnigh she swooned :</l>
       <l n="5503">And , while he gazed wonderingly at her , came</l>
       <l n="5504">The Lord of Astolat out , to whom the Prince</l>
       <l n="5505">Reported who he was , and on what quest</l>
       <l n="5506">Sent , that he bore the prize and could not find</l>
       <l n="5507">The victor , but had ridden a random round</l>
       <l n="5508">To seek him , and had wearied of the search .</l>
       <l n="5509">To whom the Lord of Astolat , ‘ Bide with us ,</l>
       <l n="5510">And ride no more at random , noble Prince !</l>
       <l n="5511">Here was the knight , and here he left a shield ;</l>
       <l n="5512">This will he send or come for : furthermore</l>
       <l n="5513">Our son is with him ; we shall hear anon ,</l>
       <l n="5514">Needs must hear . ’ To this the courteous Prince</l>
       <l n="5515">Accorded with his wonted courtesy ,</l>
       <l n="5516">Courtesy with a touch of traitor in it ,</l>
       <l n="5517">And stayed ; and cast his eyes on fair Elaine :</l>
       <l n="5518">Where could be found face daintier ? then her shape</l>
       <l n="5519">From forehead down to foot , perfect — again</l>
       <l n="5520">From foot to forehead exquisitely turned :</l>
       <l n="5521">‘ Well — if I bide , lo ! this wild flower for me ! ’</l>
       <l n="5522">And oft they met among the garden yews ,</l>
       <l n="5523">And there he set himself to play upon her</l>
       <l n="5524">With sallying wit , free flashes from a height</l>
       <l n="5525">Above her , graces of the court , and songs ,</l>
       <l n="5526">Sighs , and slow smiles , and golden eloquence</l>
       <l n="5527">And amorous adulation , till the maid</l>
       <l n="5528">Rebelled against it , saying to him , ‘ Prince ,</l>
       <l n="5529">O loyal nephew of our noble King ,</l>
       <l n="5530">Why ask you not to see the shield he left ,</l>
       <l n="5531">Whence you might learn his name ? Why slight your King ,</l>
       <l n="5532">And lose the quest he sent you on , and prove</l>
       <l n="5533">No surer than our falcon yesterday ,</l>
       <l n="5534">Who lost the hern we slipt her at , and went</l>
       <l n="5535">To all the winds ? ’ ‘ Nay , by mine head , ’ said he ,</l>
       <l n="5536">‘ I lose it , as we lose the lark in heaven ,</l>
       <l n="5537">O damsel , in the light of your blue eyes ;</l>

       <l n="5539">And when the shield was brought , and Gawain saw</l>
       <l n="5540">Sir Lancelot 's azure lions , crowned with gold ,</l>
       <l n="5541">Ramp in the field , he smote his thigh , and mocked :</l>
       <l n="5542">‘ Right was the King ! our Lancelot ! that true man ! ’</l>
       <l n="5543">‘ And right was I , ’ she answered merrily , ‘ I ,</l>
       <l n="5544">Who dreamed my knight the greatest knight of all . ’</l>
       <l n="5545">‘ And if I dreamed , ’ said Gawain , ‘ that you love</l>
       <l n="5546">This greatest knight , your pardon ! lo , ye know it !</l>
       <l n="5547">Speak therefore : shall I waste myself in vain ? ’</l>
       <l n="5548">Full simple was her answer , ‘ What know I ?</l>
       <l n="5549">My brethren have been all my fellowship ;</l>
       <l n="5550">And I , when often they have talked of love ,</l>
       <l n="5551">Wished it had been my mother , for they talked ,</l>
       <l n="5552">Meseemed , of what they knew not ; so myself —</l>
       <l n="5553">I know not if I know what true love is ,</l>
       <l n="5554">But if I know , then , if I love not him ,</l>
       <l n="5555">I know there is none other I can love . ’</l>
       <l n="5556">‘ Yea , by God 's death , ’ said he , ‘ ye love him well ,</l>
       <l n="5557">But would not , knew ye what all others know ,</l>
       <l n="5558">And whom he loves . ’ ‘ So be it , ’ cried Elaine ,</l>
       <l n="5559">And lifted her fair face and moved away :</l>
       <l n="5560">But he pursued her , calling , ‘ Stay a little !</l>
       <l n="5561">One golden minute 's grace ! he wore your sleeve :</l>
       <l n="5562">Would he break faith with one I may not name ?</l>
       <l n="5563">Must our true man change like a leaf at last ?</l>
       <l n="5564">Nay — like enow : why then , far be it from me</l>
       <l n="5565">To cross our mighty Lancelot in his loves !</l>
       <l n="5566">And , damsel , for I deem you know full well</l>
       <l n="5567">Where your great knight is hidden , let me leave</l>
       <l n="5568">My quest with you ; the diamond also : here !</l>
       <l n="5569">For if you love , it will be sweet to give it ;</l>
       <l n="5570">And if he love , it will be sweet to have it</l>
       <l n="5571">From your own hand ; and whether he love or not ,</l>
       <l n="5572">A diamond is a diamond . Fare you well</l>
       <l n="5573">A thousand times !— a thousand times farewell !</l>
       <l n="5574">Yet , if he love , and his love hold , we two</l>
       <l n="5575">May meet at court hereafter : there , I think ,</l>
       <l n="5576">So ye will learn the courtesies of the court ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="384">
       <l n="5578">Then he gave ,</l>

       <l n="5580">The diamond , and all wearied of the quest</l>
       <l n="5581">Leapt on his horse , and carolling as he went</l>
       <l n="5582">A true-love ballad , lightly rode away .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="385">
       <l n="5583">Thence to the court he past ; there told the King</l>

       <l n="5585">And added , ‘ Sire , my liege , so much I learnt ;</l>

       <l n="5589">Deeming our courtesy is the truest law ,</l>
       <l n="5590">I gave the diamond : she will render it ;</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="386">
       <l n="5592">The seldom-frowning King frowned , and replied ,</l>

       <l n="5594">On quest of mine , seeing that ye forget</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="387">
       <l n="5596">He spake and parted . Wroth , but all in awe ,</l>
       <l n="5597">For twenty strokes of the blood , without a word ,</l>
       <l n="5598">Lingered that other , staring after him ;</l>
       <l n="5599">Then shook his hair , strode off , and buzzed abroad</l>
       <l n="5600">About the maid of Astolat , and her love .</l>
       <l n="5601">All ears were pricked at once , all tongues were loosed :</l>
       <l n="5602">‘ The maid of Astolat loves Sir Lancelot ,</l>
       <l n="5603">Sir Lancelot loves the maid of Astolat . ’</l>
       <l n="5604">Some read the King 's face , some the Queen 's , and all</l>
       <l n="5605">Had marvel what the maid might be , but most</l>
       <l n="5606">Predoomed her as unworthy . One old dame</l>
       <l n="5607">Came suddenly on the Queen with the sharp news .</l>
       <l n="5608">She , that had heard the noise of it before ,</l>
       <l n="5609">But sorrowing Lancelot should have stooped so low ,</l>
       <l n="5610">Marred her friend 's aim with pale tranquillity .</l>
       <l n="5611">So ran the tale like fire about the court ,</l>
       <l n="5612">Fire in dry stubble a nine-days ’ wonder flared :</l>

       <l n="5614">Forgot to drink to Lancelot and the Queen ,</l>
       <l n="5615">And pledging Lancelot and the lily maid</l>
       <l n="5616">Smiled at each other , while the Queen , who sat</l>

       <l n="5618">Climb in her throat , and with her feet unseen</l>
       <l n="5619">Crushed the wild passion out against the floor</l>
       <l n="5620">Beneath the banquet , where all the meats became</l>
       <l n="5621">As wormwood , and she hated all who pledged .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="388">
       <l n="5622">But far away the maid in Astolat ,</l>

       <l n="5638">Lest I be found as faithless in the quest</l>

       <l n="5642">Death-pale , for lack of gentle maiden 's aid .</l>
       <l n="5643">The gentler-born the maiden , the more bound ,</l>

       <l n="5646">When these have worn their tokens : let me hence</l>

       <l n="5652">For any mouth to gape for save a queen 's —</l>
       <l n="5653">Nay , I mean nothing : so then , get you gone ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="389">
       <l n="5655">Lightly , her suit allowed , she slipt away ,</l>

       <l n="5661">But she was happy enough and shook it off ,</l>
       <l n="5662">As we shake off the bee that buzzes at us ;</l>

       <l n="5664">‘ What matter , so I help him back to life ? ’</l>
       <l n="5665">Then far away with good Sir Torre for guide</l>
       <l n="5666">Rode o'er the long backs of the bushless downs</l>
       <l n="5667">To Camelot , and before the city-gates</l>
       <l n="5668">Came on her brother with a happy face</l>
       <l n="5669">Making a roan horse caper and curvet</l>
       <l n="5670">For pleasure all about a field of flowers :</l>
       <l n="5671">Whom when she saw , ‘ Lavaine , ’ she cried , ‘ Lavaine ,</l>
       <l n="5672">How fares my lord Sir Lancelot ? ’ He amazed ,</l>
       <l n="5673">‘ Torre and Elaine ! why here ? Sir Lancelot !</l>
       <l n="5674">How know ye my lord 's name is Lancelot ? ’</l>
       <l n="5675">But when the maid had told him all her tale ,</l>

       <l n="5677">Left them , and under the strange-statued gate ,</l>
       <l n="5678">Where Arthur 's wars were rendered mystically ,</l>
       <l n="5679">Past up the still rich city to his kin ,</l>
       <l n="5680">His own far blood , which dwelt at Camelot ;</l>
       <l n="5681">And her , Lavaine across the poplar grove</l>
       <l n="5682">Led to the caves : there first she saw the casque</l>
       <l n="5683">Of Lancelot on the wall : her scarlet sleeve ,</l>
       <l n="5684">Though carved and cut , and half the pearls away ,</l>
       <l n="5685">Streamed from it still ; and in her heart she laughed ,</l>
       <l n="5686">Because he had not loosed it from his helm ,</l>
       <l n="5687">But meant once more perchance to tourney in it .</l>
       <l n="5688">And when they gained the cell wherein he slept ,</l>
       <l n="5689">His battle-writhen arms and mighty hands</l>
       <l n="5690">Lay naked on the wolfskin , and a dream</l>
       <l n="5691">Of dragging down his enemy made them move .</l>
       <l n="5692">Then she that saw him lying unsleek , unshorn ,</l>
       <l n="5693">Gaunt as it were the skeleton of himself ,</l>
       <l n="5694">Uttered a little tender dolorous cry .</l>
       <l n="5695">The sound not wonted in a place so still</l>
       <l n="5696">Woke the sick knight , and while he rolled his eyes</l>
       <l n="5697">Yet blank from sleep , she started to him , saying ,</l>
       <l n="5698">‘ Your prize the diamond sent you by the King : ’</l>
       <l n="5699">His eyes glistened : she fancied ‘ Is it for me ? ’</l>

       <l n="5702">Assigned to her not worthy of it , she knelt</l>
       <l n="5703">Full lowly by the corners of his bed ,</l>
       <l n="5704">And laid the diamond in his open hand .</l>
       <l n="5705">Her face was near , and as we kiss the child</l>
       <l n="5706">That does the task assigned , he kissed her face .</l>
       <l n="5707">At once she slipt like water to the floor .</l>
       <l n="5708">‘ Alas , ’ he said , ‘ your ride hath wearied you .</l>
       <l n="5709">Rest must you have . ’ ‘ No rest for me , ’ she said ;</l>
       <l n="5710">‘ Nay , for near you , fair lord , I am at rest . ’</l>
       <l n="5711">What might she mean by that ? his large black eyes ,</l>
       <l n="5712">Yet larger through his leanness , dwelt upon her ,</l>
       <l n="5713">Till all her heart 's sad secret blazed itself</l>

       <l n="5718">Save one , he not regarded , and so turned</l>

       <l n="8515">First mainly through that sullying of our Queen —</l>
       <l n="8516">Began to gall the knighthood , asking whence</l>

       <l n="8518">Dropt down from heaven ? washed up from out the deep ?</l>

       <l n="8555">So then , when both were brought to full accord ,</l>

       <l n="8627">Spied where he couched , and as the gardener 's hand</l>
       <l n="8628">Picks from the colewort a green caterpillar ,</l>
       <l n="8629">So from the high wall and the flowering grove</l>

       <l n="8632">But when he knew the Prince though marred with dust ,</l>
       <l n="8633">He , reverencing king 's blood in a bad man ,</l>
       <l n="8634">Made such excuses as he might , and these</l>
       <l n="8635">Full knightly without scorn ; for in those days</l>
       <l n="8636">No knight of Arthur 's noblest dealt in scorn ;</l>
       <l n="8637">But , if a man were halt or hunched , in him</l>
       <l n="8638">By those whom God had made full-limbed and tall ,</l>

       <l n="8643">Full sharply smote his knees , and smiled , and went :</l>
       <l n="8644">But , ever after , the small violence done</l>
       <l n="8645">Rankled in him and ruffled all his heart ,</l>
       <l n="8646">As the sharp wind that ruffles all day long</l>
       <l n="8647">A little bitter pool about a stone</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="613">
       <l n="8649">But when Sir Lancelot told</l>

       <l n="8651">Lightly , to think of Modred 's dusty fall ,</l>
       <l n="8652">Then shuddered , as the village wife who cries</l>
       <l n="8653">‘ I shudder , some one steps across my grave ; ’</l>
       <l n="8654">Then laughed again , but faintlier , for indeed</l>
       <l n="8655">She half-foresaw that he , the subtle beast ,</l>
       <l n="8656">Would track her guilt until he found , and hers</l>
       <l n="8657">Would be for evermore a name of scorn .</l>
       <l n="8658">Henceforward rarely could she front in hall ,</l>
       <l n="8659">Or elsewhere , Modred 's narrow foxy face ,</l>
       <l n="8660">Heart-hiding smile , and gray persistent eye :</l>
       <l n="8661">Henceforward too , the Powers that tend the soul ,</l>
       <l n="8662">To help it from the death that cannot die ,</l>
       <l n="8663">And save it even in extremes , began</l>
       <l n="8664">To vex and plague her . Many a time for hours ,</l>
       <l n="8665">Beside the placid breathings of the King ,</l>
       <l n="8666">In the dead night , grim faces came and went</l>
       <l n="8667">Before her , or a vague spiritual fear —</l>
       <l n="8668">Like to some doubtful noise of creaking doors ,</l>
       <l n="8669">Heard by the watcher in a haunted house ,</l>
       <l n="8670">That keeps the rust of murder on the walls —</l>
       <l n="8671">Held her awake : or if she slept , she dreamed</l>
       <l n="8672">An awful dream ; for then she seemed to stand</l>
       <l n="8673">On some vast plain before a setting sun ,</l>
       <l n="8674">And from the sun there swiftly made at her</l>
       <l n="8675">A ghastly something , and its shadow flew</l>
       <l n="8676">Before it , till it touched her , and she turned —</l>
       <l n="8677">When lo ! her own , that broadening from her feet ,</l>
       <l n="8678">And blackening , swallowed all the land , and in it</l>
       <l n="8679">Far cities burnt , and with a cry she woke .</l>
       <l n="8680">And all this trouble did not pass but grew ;</l>
       <l n="8681">Till even the clear face of the guileless King ,</l>
       <l n="8682">And trustful courtesies of household life ,</l>
       <l n="8683">Became her bane ; and at the last she said ,</l>
       <l n="8684">‘ O Lancelot , get thee hence to thine own land ,</l>
       <l n="8685">For if thou tarry we shall meet again ,</l>
       <l n="8686">And if we meet again , some evil chance</l>
       <l n="8687">Will make the smouldering scandal break and blaze</l>
       <l n="8688">Before the people , and our lord the King . ’</l>
       <l n="8689">And Lancelot ever promised , but remained ,</l>
       <l n="8690">And still they met and met . Again she said ,</l>
       <l n="8691">‘ O Lancelot , if thou love me get thee hence . ’</l>
       <l n="8692">And then they were agreed upon a night</l>
       <l n="8693">( When the good King should not be there ) to meet</l>
       <l n="8694">And part for ever . Vivien , lurking , heard .</l>
       <l n="8695">She told Sir Modred . Passion-pale they met</l>
       <l n="8696">And greeted . Hands in hands , and eye to eye ,</l>
       <l n="8697">Low on the border of her couch they sat</l>
       <l n="8698">Stammering and staring . It was their last hour ,</l>
       <l n="8699">A madness of farewells . And Modred brought</l>
       <l n="8700">His creatures to the basement of the tower</l>
       <l n="8701">For testimony ; and crying with full voice</l>
       <l n="8702">‘ Traitor , come out , ye are trapt at last , ’ aroused</l>
       <l n="8703">Lancelot , who rushing outward lionlike</l>
       <l n="8704">Leapt on him , and hurled him headlong , and he fell</l>
       <l n="8705">Stunned , and his creatures took and bare him off ,</l>
       <l n="8706">And all was still : then she , ‘ The end is come ,</l>
       <l n="8707">And I am shamed for ever ; ’ and he said ,</l>
       <l n="8708">‘ Mine be the shame ; mine was the sin : but rise ,</l>
       <l n="8709">And fly to my strong castle overseas :</l>
       <l n="8710">There will I hide thee , till my life shall end ,</l>
       <l n="8711">There hold thee with my life against the world . ’</l>
       <l n="8712">She answered , ‘ Lancelot , wilt thou hold me so ?</l>
       <l n="8713">Nay , friend , for we have taken our farewells .</l>
       <l n="8714">Would God that thou couldst hide me from myself !</l>
       <l n="8715">Mine is the shame , for I was wife , and thou</l>
       <l n="8716">Unwedded : yet rise now , and let us fly ,</l>
       <l n="8717">For I will draw me into sanctuary ,</l>
       <l n="8718">And bide my doom . ’ So Lancelot got her horse ,</l>
       <l n="8719">Set her thereon , and mounted on his own ,</l>
       <l n="8720">And then they rode to the divided way ,</l>
       <l n="8721">There kissed , and parted weeping : for he past ,</l>
       <l n="8722">Love-loyal to the least wish of the Queen ,</l>
       <l n="8723">Back to his land ; but she to Almesbury</l>
       <l n="8724">Fled all night long by glimmering waste and weald ,</l>
       <l n="8725">And heard the Spirits of the waste and weald</l>
       <l n="8726">Moan as she fled , or thought she heard them moan :</l>
       <l n="8727">And in herself she moaned ‘ Too late , too late ! ’</l>
       <l n="8728">Till in the cold wind that foreruns the morn ,</l>
       <l n="8729">A blot in heaven , the Raven , flying high ,</l>
       <l n="8730">Croaked , and she thought , ‘ He spies a field of death ;</l>
       <l n="8731">For now the Heathen of the Northern Sea ,</l>
       <l n="8732">Lured by the crimes and frailties of the court ,</l>
       <l n="8733">Begin to slay the folk , and spoil the land . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="614">
       <l n="8734">And when she came to Almesbury she spake</l>
       <l n="8735">There to the nuns , and said , ‘ Mine enemies</l>
       <l n="8736">Pursue me , but , O peaceful Sisterhood ,</l>
       <l n="8737">Receive , and yield me sanctuary , nor ask</l>
       <l n="8738">Her name to whom ye yield it , till her time</l>
       <l n="8739">To tell you : ’ and her beauty , grace and power ,</l>
       <l n="8740">Wrought as a charm upon them , and they spared</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="615">
       <l n="8742">So the stately Queen abode</l>

       <l n="8744">Nor with them mixed , nor told her name , nor sought ,</l>
       <l n="8745">Wrapt in her grief , for housel or for shrift ,</l>
       <l n="8746">But communed only with the little maid ,</l>
       <l n="8747">Who pleased her with a babbling heedlessness</l>
       <l n="8748">Which often lured her from herself ; but now ,</l>
       <l n="8749">This night , a rumour wildly blown about</l>
       <l n="8750">Came , that Sir Modred had usurped the realm ,</l>
       <l n="8751">And leagued him with the heathen , while the King</l>
       <l n="8752">Was waging war on Lancelot : then she thought ,</l>
       <l n="8753">‘ With what a hate the people and the King</l>
       <l n="8754">Must hate me , ’ and bowed down upon her hands</l>
       <l n="8755">Silent , until the little maid , who brooked</l>
       <l n="8756">No silence , brake it , uttering , ‘ Late ! so late !</l>
       <l n="8757">What hour , I wonder , now ? ’ and when she drew</l>
       <l n="8758">No answer , by and by began to hum</l>
       <l n="8759">An air the nuns had taught her ; ‘ Late , so late ! ’</l>
       <l n="8760">Which when she heard , the Queen looked up , and said ,</l>
       <l n="8761">‘ O maiden , if indeed ye list to sing ,</l>
       <l n="8762">Sing , and unbind my heart that I may weep . ’</l>
       <l n="8763">Whereat full willingly sang the little maid .</l>

       <l n="18">For his own self , and his own Queen , and realm ,</l>
       <l n="19">Must needs be thrice as great as any of ours .</l>
       <l n="20">For me , I thank the saints , I am not great .</l>
       <l n="21">For if there ever come a grief to me</l>

       <l n="28">Silence , they cannot weep behind a cloud :</l>
       <l n="29">As even here they talk at Almesbury</l>
       <l n="30">About the good King and his wicked Queen ,</l>

       <l n="55">So said my father , and himself was knight</l>
       <l n="56">Of the great Table — at the founding of it ;</l>
       <l n="57">And rode thereto from Lyonnesse , and he said</l>
       <l n="58">That as he rode , an hour or maybe twain</l>
       <l n="59">After the sunset , down the coast , he heard</l>
       <l n="60">Strange music , and he paused , and turning — there ,</l>
       <l n="61">All down the lonely coast of Lyonnesse ,</l>
       <l n="62">Each with a beacon-star upon his head ,</l>
       <l n="63">And with a wild sea-light about his feet ,</l>
       <l n="64">He saw them — headland after headland flame</l>
       <l n="65">Far on into the rich heart of the west :</l>
       <l n="66">And in the light the white mermaiden swam ,</l>
       <l n="67">And strong man-breasted things stood from the sea ,</l>
       <l n="68">And sent a deep sea-voice through all the land ,</l>
       <l n="69">To which the little elves of chasm and cleft</l>
       <l n="70">Made answer , sounding like a distant horn .</l>
       <l n="71">So said my father — yea , and furthermore ,</l>
       <l n="72">Next morning , while he past the dim-lit woods ,</l>
       <l n="73">Himself beheld three spirits mad with joy</l>
       <l n="74">Come dashing down on a tall wayside flower ,</l>
       <l n="75">That shook beneath them , as the thistle shakes</l>
       <l n="76">When three gray linnets wrangle for the seed :</l>
       <l n="77">And still at evenings on before his horse</l>
       <l n="78">The flickering fairy-circle wheeled and broke</l>
       <l n="79">Flying , and linked again , and wheeled and broke</l>
       <l n="80">Flying , for all the land was full of life .</l>
       <l n="81">And when at last he came to Camelot ,</l>
       <l n="82">A wreath of airy dancers hand-in-hand</l>
       <l n="83">Swung round the lighted lantern of the hall ;</l>
       <l n="84">And in the hall itself was such a feast</l>
       <l n="85">As never man had dreamed ; for every knight</l>
       <l n="86">Had whatsoever meat he longed for served</l>
       <l n="87">By hands unseen ; and even as he said</l>
       <l n="88">Down in the cellars merry bloated things</l>
       <l n="89">Shouldered the spigot , straddling on the butts</l>
       <l n="90">While the wine ran : so glad were spirits and men</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="92">Then spake the Queen and somewhat bitterly ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="97">To whom the novice garrulously again ,</l>

       <l n="101">Between the steep cliff and the coming wave ;</l>
       <l n="102">And many a mystic lay of life and death</l>
       <l n="103">Had chanted on the smoky mountain-tops ,</l>
       <l n="104">When round him bent the spirits of the hills</l>
       <l n="105">With all their dewy hair blown back like flame :</l>
       <l n="106">So said my father — and that night the bard</l>
       <l n="107">Sang Arthur 's glorious wars , and sang the King</l>

       <l n="109">Who called him the false son of Gorlois :</l>
       <l n="110">For there was no man knew from whence he came ;</l>
       <l n="111">But after tempest , when the long wave broke</l>
       <l n="112">All down the thundering shores of Bude and Bos ,</l>
       <l n="113">There came a day as still as heaven , and then</l>
       <l n="114">They found a naked child upon the sands</l>
       <l n="115">Of dark Tintagil by the Cornish sea ;</l>
       <l n="116">And that was Arthur ; and they fostered him</l>
       <l n="117">Till he by miracle was approven King :</l>
       <l n="118">And that his grave should be a mystery</l>
       <l n="119">From all men , like his birth ; and could he find</l>

       <l n="121">As he was in his manhood , then , he sang ,</l>
       <l n="122">The twain together well might change the world .</l>
       <l n="123">But even in the middle of his song</l>
       <l n="124">He faltered , and his hand fell from the harp ,</l>
       <l n="125">And pale he turned , and reeled , and would have fallen ,</l>
       <l n="126">But that they stayed him up ; nor would he tell</l>
       <l n="127">His vision ; but what doubt that he foresaw</l>

       <l n="133">Shame on her own garrulity garrulously ,</l>

       <l n="135">Full often , ‘ and , sweet lady , if I seem</l>

       <l n="158">‘ Yea , ’ said the maid , ‘ be manners such fair fruit ? ’</l>

       <l n="780">What good should follow this , if this were done ?</l>
       <l n="781">What harm , undone ? Deep harm to disobey ,</l>
       <l n="782">Seeing obedience is the bond of rule .</l>

       <l n="825">Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon ,</l>
       <l n="826">And flashing round and round , and whirled in an arch ,</l>
       <l n="827">Shot like a streamer of the northern morn ,</l>

       <l n="829">By night , with noises of the Northern Sea .</l>
       <l n="830">So flashed and fell the brand Excalibur :</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="55">
       <l n="839">And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere :</l>

       <l n="842">Nor shall see , here or elsewhere , till I die ,</l>
       <l n="843">Not though I live three lives of mortal men ,</l>
       <l n="844">So great a miracle as yonder hilt .</l>
       <l n="845">Then with both hands I flung him , wheeling him ;</l>
       <l n="846">But when I looked again , behold an arm ,</l>
       <l n="847">Clothed in white samite , mystic , wonderful ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="56">

       <l n="852">Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="57">
       <l n="855">So saying , from the pavement he half rose ,</l>
       <l n="856">Slowly , with pain , reclining on his arm ,</l>
       <l n="857">And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes</l>
       <l n="858">As in a picture . Him Sir Bedivere</l>
       <l n="859">Remorsefully regarded through his tears ,</l>
       <l n="860">And would have spoken , but he found not words ;</l>
       <l n="861">Then took with care , and kneeling on one knee ,</l>
       <l n="862">O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="58">
       <l n="864">But , as he walked , King Arthur panted hard ,</l>
       <l n="865">Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed</l>
       <l n="866">When all the house is mute . So sighed the King ,</l>
       <l n="867">Muttering and murmuring at his ear , ‘ Quick , quick !</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="59">
       <l n="869">But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge ,</l>
       <l n="870">Clothed with his breath , and looking , as he walked ,</l>
       <l n="871">Larger than human on the frozen hills .</l>
       <l n="872">He heard the deep behind him , and a cry</l>
       <l n="873">Before . His own thought drove him like a goad .</l>
       <l n="874">Dry clashed his harness in the icy caves</l>
       <l n="875">And barren chasms , and all to left and right</l>
       <l n="876">The bare black cliff clanged round him , as he based</l>
       <l n="877">His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang</l>
       <l n="878">Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels —</l>
       <l n="879">And on a sudden , lo ! the level lake ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="60">
       <l n="881">Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge ,</l>
       <l n="882">Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern ,</l>
       <l n="883">Beneath them ; and descending they were ware</l>
       <l n="884">That all the decks were dense with stately forms ,</l>
       <l n="885">Black-stoled , black-hooded , like a dream — by these</l>
       <l n="886">Three Queens with crowns of gold : and from them rose</l>
       <l n="887">A cry that shivered to the tingling stars ,</l>
       <l n="888">And , as it were one voice , an agony</l>
       <l n="889">Of lamentation , like a wind that shrills</l>
       <l n="890">All night in a waste land , where no one comes ,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="61">
       <l n="892">Then murmured Arthur , ‘ Place me in the barge . ’</l>
       <l n="893">So to the barge they came . There those three Queens</l>
       <l n="894">Put forth their hands , and took the King , and wept .</l>
       <l n="895">But she , that rose the tallest of them all</l>
       <l n="896">And fairest , laid his head upon her lap ,</l>
       <l n="897">And loosed the shattered casque , and chafed his hands ,</l>
       <l n="898">And called him by his name , complaining loud ,</l>
       <l n="899">And dropping bitter tears against a brow</l>
       <l n="900">Striped with dark blood : for all his face was white</l>
       <l n="901">And colourless , and like the withered moon</l>
       <l n="902">Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east ;</l>
       <l n="903">And all his greaves and cuisses dashed with drops</l>
       <l n="904">Of onset ; and the light and lustrous curls —</l>
       <l n="905">That made his forehead like a rising sun</l>
       <l n="906">High from the dais-throne — were parched with dust ;</l>
       <l n="907">Or , clotted into points and hanging loose ,</l>
       <l n="908">Mixed with the knightly growth that fringed his lips .</l>
       <l n="909">So like a shattered column lay the King ;</l>
       <l n="910">Not like that Arthur who , with lance in rest ,</l>
       <l n="911">From spur to plume a star of tournament ,</l>
       <l n="912">Shot through the lists at Camelot , and charged</l>

      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="62">
       <l n="914">Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere :</l>

       <l n="916">Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes ?</l>
       <l n="917">For now I see the true old times are dead ,</l>
       <l n="918">When every morning brought a noble chance ,</l>
       <l n="919">And every chance brought out a noble knight .</l>
       <l n="920">Such times have been not since the light that led</l>
       <l n="921">The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh .</l>
       <l n="922">But now the whole Round Table is dissolved</l>
       <l n="923">Which was an image of the mighty world ,</l>
       <l n="924">And I , the last , go forth companionless ,</l>
       <l n="925">And the days darken round me , and the years ,</l>
       <l n="926">Among new men , strange faces , other minds . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="63">
       <l n="927">And slowly answered Arthur from the barge :</l>
       <l n="928">‘ The old order changeth , yielding place to new ,</l>
       <l n="929">And God fulfils himself in many ways ,</l>
       <l n="930">Lest one good custom should corrupt the world .</l>
       <l n="931">Comfort thyself : what comfort is in me ?</l>
       <l n="932">I have lived my life , and that which I have done</l>
       <l n="933">May He within himself make pure ! but thou ,</l>
       <l n="934">If thou shouldst never see my face again ,</l>
       <l n="935">Pray for my soul . More things are wrought by prayer</l>
       <l n="936">Than this world dreams of . Wherefore , let thy voice</l>
       <l n="937">Rise like a fountain for me night and day .</l>
       <l n="938">For what are men better than sheep or goats</l>
       <l n="939">That nourish a blind life within the brain ,</l>
       <l n="940">If , knowing God , they lift not hands of prayer</l>
       <l n="941">Both for themselves and those who call them friend ?</l>
       <l n="942">For so the whole round earth is every way</l>
       <l n="943">Bound by gold chains about the feet of God .</l>
       <l n="944">But now farewell . I am going a long way</l>
       <l n="945">With these thou seest — if indeed I go</l>
       <l n="946">( For all my mind is clouded with a doubt ) —</l>
       <l n="947">To the island-valley of Avilion ;</l>
       <l n="948">Where falls not hail , or rain , or any snow ,</l>
       <l n="949">Nor ever wind blows loudly ; but it lies</l>
       <l n="950">Deep-meadowed , happy , fair with orchard lawns</l>
       <l n="951">And bowery hollows crowned with summer sea ,</l>
       <l n="952">Where I will heal me of my grievous wound . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="64">
       <l n="953">So said he , and the barge with oar and sail</l>
       <l n="954">Moved from the brink , like some full-breasted swan</l>
       <l n="955">That , fluting a wild carol ere her death ,</l>
       <l n="956">Ruffles her pure cold plume , and takes the flood</l>
       <l n="957">With swarthy webs . Long stood Sir Bedivere</l>
       <l n="958">Revolving many memories , till the hull</l>
       <l n="959">Looked one black dot against the verge of dawn ,</l>
       <l n="960">And on the mere the wailing died away .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="65">
       <l n="961">But when that moan had past for evermore ,</l>
       <l n="962">The stillness of the dead world 's winter dawn</l>
       <l n="963">Amazed him , and he groaned , ‘ The King is gone . ’</l>
       <l n="964">And therewithal came on him the weird rhyme ,</l>
       <l n="965">‘ From the great deep to the great deep he goes . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="66">
       <l n="966">Whereat he slowly turned and slowly clomb</l>
       <l n="967">The last hard footstep of that iron crag ;</l>
       <l n="968">Thence marked the black hull moving yet , and cried ,</l>
       <l n="969">‘ He passes to be King among the dead ,</l>
       <l n="970">And after healing of his grievous wound</l>
       <l n="971">He comes again ; but — if he come no more —</l>
       <l n="972">O me , be yon dark Queens in yon black boat ,</l>
       <l n="973">Who shrieked and wailed , the three whereat we gazed</l>
       <l n="974">On that high day , when , clothed with living light ,</l>
       <l n="975">They stood before his throne in silence , friends</l>
       <l n="976">Of Arthur , who should help him at his need ? ’</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="67">
       <l n="977">Then from the dawn it seemed there came , but faint</l>
       <l n="978">As from beyond the limit of the world ,</l>
       <l n="979">Like the last echo born of a great cry ,</l>
       <l n="980">Sounds , as if some fair city were one voice</l>
       <l n="981">Around a king returning from his wars .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="68">
       <l n="982">Thereat once more he moved about , and clomb</l>
       <l n="983">Even to the highest he could climb , and saw ,</l>
       <l n="984">Straining his eyes beneath an arch of hand ,</l>
       <l n="985">Or thought he saw , the speck that bare the King ,</l>
       <l n="986">Down that long water opening on the deep</l>
       <l n="987">Somewhere far off , pass on and on , and go</l>
       <l n="988">From less to less and vanish into light .</l>

       <l n="990">To the Queen</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="70">
       <l n="991">O loyal to the royal in thyself ,</l>
       <l n="992">And loyal to thy land , as this to thee —</l>
       <l n="993">Bear witness , that rememberable day ,</l>
       <l n="994">When , pale as yet , and fever-worn , the Prince</l>
       <l n="995">Who scarce had plucked his flickering life again</l>
       <l n="996">From halfway down the shadow of the grave ,</l>
       <l n="997">Past with thee through thy people and their love ,</l>
       <l n="998">And London rolled one tide of joy through all</l>
       <l n="999">Her trebled millions , and loud leagues of man</l>
       <l n="1000">And welcome ! witness , too , the silent cry ,</l>
       <l n="1001">The prayer of many a race and creed , and clime —</l>
       <l n="1002">Thunderless lightnings striking under sea</l>
       <l n="1003">From sunset and sunrise of all thy realm ,</l>
       <l n="1004">And that true North , whereof we lately heard</l>
       <l n="1005">A strain to shame us ‘ keep you to yourselves ;</l>
       <l n="1006">So loyal is too costly ! friends — your love</l>
       <l n="1007">Is but a burthen : loose the bond , and go . ’</l>
       <l n="1008">Is this the tone of empire ? here the faith</l>
       <l n="1009">That made us rulers ? this , indeed , her voice</l>
       <l n="1010">And meaning , whom the roar of Hougoumont</l>
       <l n="1011">Left mightiest of all peoples under heaven ?</l>
       <l n="1012">What shock has fooled her since , that she should speak</l>
       <l n="1013">So feebly ? wealthier — wealthier — hour by hour !</l>
       <l n="1014">The voice of Britain , or a sinking land ,</l>
       <l n="1015">Some third-rate isle half-lost among her seas ?</l>
       <l n="1016">There rang her voice , when the full city pealed</l>
       <l n="1017">Thee and thy Prince ! The loyal to their crown</l>
       <l n="1018">Are loyal to their own far sons , who love</l>
       <l n="1019">Our ocean-empire with her boundless homes</l>
       <l n="1020">For ever-broadening England , and her throne</l>
       <l n="1021">In our vast Orient , and one isle , one isle ,</l>
       <l n="1022">That knows not her own greatness : if she knows</l>
       <l n="1023">And dreads it we are fallen . — But thou , my Queen ,</l>
       <l n="1024">Not for itself , but through thy living love</l>
       <l n="1025">For one to whom I made it o'er his grave</l>
       <l n="1026">Sacred , accept this old imperfect tale ,</l>
       <l n="1027">New-old , and shadowing Sense at war with Soul ,</l>
       <l n="1028">Ideal manhood closed in real man ,</l>
       <l n="1029">Rather than that gray king , whose name , a ghost ,</l>
       <l n="1030">Streams like a cloud , man-shaped , from mountain peak ,</l>
       <l n="1031">And cleaves to cairn and cromlech still ; or him</l>
       <l n="1032">Of Geoffrey 's book , or him of Malleor 's , one</l>
       <l n="1033">Touched by the adulterous finger of a time</l>
       <l n="1034">That hovered between war and wantonness ,</l>
       <l n="1035">And crownings and dethronements : take withal</l>
       <l n="1036">Thy poet 's blessing , and his trust that Heaven</l>
       <l n="1037">Will blow the tempest in the distance back</l>
       <l n="1038">From thine and ours : for some are scared , who mark ,</l>
       <l n="1039">Or wisely or unwisely , signs of storm ,</l>
       <l n="1040">Waverings of every vane with every wind ,</l>
       <l n="1041">And wordy trucklings to the transient hour ,</l>
       <l n="1042">And fierce or careless looseners of the faith ,</l>
       <l n="1043">And Softness breeding scorn of simple life ,</l>
       <l n="1044">Or Cowardice , the child of lust for gold ,</l>
       <l n="1045">Or Labour , with a groan and not a voice ,</l>
       <l n="1046">Or Art with poisonous honey stolen from France ,</l>
       <l n="1047">And that which knows , but careful for itself ,</l>
       <l n="1048">And that which knows not , ruling that which knows</l>
       <l n="1049">To its own harm : the goal of this great world</l>
       <l n="1050">Lies beyond sight : yet — if our slowly-grown</l>
       <l n="1051">And crowned Republic 's crowning common-sense ,</l>
       <l n="1052">That saved her many times , not fail — their fears</l>
       <l n="1053">Are morning shadows huger than the shapes</l>
       <l n="1054">That cast them , not those gloomier which forego</l>
       <l n="1055">The darkness of that battle in the West ,</l>
       <l n="1056">Where all of high and holy dies away .</l>
