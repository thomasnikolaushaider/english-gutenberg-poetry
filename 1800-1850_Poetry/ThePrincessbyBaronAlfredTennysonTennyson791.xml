    <head>PROLOGUE</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Sir Walter Vivian all a summer 's day</l>
     <l n="2">Gave his broad lawns until the set of sun</l>
     <l n="3">Up to the people : thither flocked at noon</l>
     <l n="4">His tenants , wife and child , and thither half</l>
     <l n="5">The neighbouring borough with their Institute</l>
     <l n="6">Of which he was the patron . I was there</l>
     <l n="7">From college , visiting the son ,— the son</l>
     <l n="8">A Walter too ,— with others of our set ,</l>
     <l n="9">Five others : we were seven at Vivian-place .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">And me that morning Walter showed the house ,</l>
     <l n="11">Greek , set with busts : from vases in the hall</l>
     <l n="12">Flowers of all heavens , and lovelier than their names ,</l>
     <l n="13">Grew side by side ; and on the pavement lay</l>
     <l n="14">Carved stones of the Abbey-ruin in the park ,</l>
     <l n="15">Huge Ammonites , and the first bones of Time ;</l>
     <l n="16">And on the tables every clime and age</l>
     <l n="17">Jumbled together ; celts and calumets ,</l>
     <l n="18">Claymore and snowshoe , toys in lava , fans</l>
     <l n="19">Of sandal , amber , ancient rosaries ,</l>
     <l n="20">Laborious orient ivory sphere in sphere ,</l>
     <l n="21">The cursed Malayan crease , and battle-clubs</l>
     <l n="22">From the isles of palm : and higher on the walls ,</l>
     <l n="23">Betwixt the monstrous horns of elk and deer ,</l>
     <l n="24">His own forefathers ’ arms and armour hung .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="25">And ‘ this ’ he said ‘ was Hugh 's at Agincourt ;</l>
     <l n="26">And that was old Sir Ralph 's at Ascalon :</l>
     <l n="27">A good knight he ! we keep a chronicle</l>
     <l n="28">With all about him ’ — which he brought , and I</l>
     <l n="29">Dived in a hoard of tales that dealt with knights ,</l>
     <l n="30">Half-legend , half-historic , counts and kings</l>
     <l n="31">Who laid about them at their wills and died ;</l>
     <l n="32">And mixt with these , a lady , one that armed</l>
     <l n="33">Her own fair head , and sallying through the gate ,</l>
     <l n="34">Had beat her foes with slaughter from her walls .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="35">‘ O miracle of women , ’ said the book ,</l>
     <l n="36">‘ O noble heart who , being strait-besieged</l>
     <l n="37">By this wild king to force her to his wish ,</l>
     <l n="38">Nor bent , nor broke , nor shunned a soldier 's death ,</l>
     <l n="39">But now when all was lost or seemed as lost —</l>
     <l n="40">Her stature more than mortal in the burst</l>
     <l n="41">Of sunrise , her arm lifted , eyes on fire —</l>
     <l n="42">Brake with a blast of trumpets from the gate ,</l>
     <l n="43">And , falling on them like a thunderbolt ,</l>
     <l n="44">She trampled some beneath her horses ’ heels ,</l>
     <l n="45">And some were whelmed with missiles of the wall ,</l>
     <l n="46">And some were pushed with lances from the rock ,</l>
     <l n="47">And part were drowned within the whirling brook :</l>
     <l n="48">O miracle of noble womanhood ! ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="49">So sang the gallant glorious chronicle ;</l>
     <l n="50">And , I all rapt in this , ‘ Come out , ’ he said ,</l>
     <l n="51">‘ To the Abbey : there is Aunt Elizabeth</l>
     <l n="52">And sister Lilia with the rest . ’ We went</l>
     <l n="53">( I kept the book and had my finger in it )</l>
     <l n="54">Down through the park : strange was the sight to me ;</l>
     <l n="55">For all the sloping pasture murmured , sown</l>
     <l n="56">With happy faces and with holiday .</l>
     <l n="57">There moved the multitude , a thousand heads :</l>
     <l n="58">The patient leaders of their Institute</l>
     <l n="59">Taught them with facts . One reared a font of stone</l>
     <l n="60">And drew , from butts of water on the slope ,</l>
     <l n="61">The fountain of the moment , playing , now</l>
     <l n="62">A twisted snake , and now a rain of pearls ,</l>
     <l n="63">Or steep-up spout whereon the gilded ball</l>
     <l n="64">Danced like a wisp : and somewhat lower down</l>
     <l n="65">A man with knobs and wires and vials fired</l>
     <l n="66">A cannon : Echo answered in her sleep</l>
     <l n="67">From hollow fields : and here were telescopes</l>
     <l n="68">For azure views ; and there a group of girls</l>
     <l n="69">In circle waited , whom the electric shock</l>
     <l n="70">Dislinked with shrieks and laughter : round the lake</l>
     <l n="71">A little clock-work steamer paddling plied</l>
     <l n="72">And shook the lilies : perched about the knolls</l>
     <l n="73">A dozen angry models jetted steam :</l>
     <l n="74">A petty railway ran : a fire-balloon</l>
     <l n="75">Rose gem-like up before the dusky groves</l>
     <l n="76">And dropt a fairy parachute and past :</l>
     <l n="77">And there through twenty posts of telegraph</l>
     <l n="78">They flashed a saucy message to and fro</l>
     <l n="79">Between the mimic stations ; so that sport</l>
     <l n="80">Went hand in hand with Science ; otherwhere</l>
     <l n="81">Pure sport ; a herd of boys with clamour bowled</l>
     <l n="82">And stumped the wicket ; babies rolled about</l>
     <l n="83">Like tumbled fruit in grass ; and men and maids</l>
     <l n="84">Arranged a country dance , and flew through light</l>
     <l n="85">And shadow , while the twangling violin</l>
     <l n="86">Struck up with Soldier-laddie , and overhead</l>
     <l n="87">The broad ambrosial aisles of lofty lime</l>
     <l n="88">Made noise with bees and breeze from end to end .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="89">Strange was the sight and smacking of the time ;</l>
     <l n="90">And long we gazed , but satiated at length</l>
     <l n="91">Came to the ruins . High-arched and ivy-claspt ,</l>
     <l n="92">Of finest Gothic lighter than a fire ,</l>
     <l n="93">Through one wide chasm of time and frost they gave</l>
     <l n="94">The park , the crowd , the house ; but all within</l>
     <l n="95">The sward was trim as any garden lawn :</l>
     <l n="96">And here we lit on Aunt Elizabeth ,</l>
     <l n="97">And Lilia with the rest , and lady friends</l>
     <l n="98">From neighbour seats : and there was Ralph himself ,</l>
     <l n="99">A broken statue propt against the wall ,</l>
     <l n="100">As gay as any . Lilia , wild with sport ,</l>
     <l n="101">Half child half woman as she was , had wound</l>
     <l n="102">A scarf of orange round the stony helm ,</l>
     <l n="103">And robed the shoulders in a rosy silk ,</l>
     <l n="104">That made the old warrior from his ivied nook</l>
     <l n="105">Glow like a sunbeam : near his tomb a feast</l>
     <l n="106">Shone , silver-set ; about it lay the guests ,</l>
     <l n="107">And there we joined them : then the maiden Aunt</l>
     <l n="108">Took this fair day for text , and from it preached</l>
     <l n="109">An universal culture for the crowd ,</l>
     <l n="110">And all things great ; but we , unworthier , told</l>
     <l n="111">Of college : he had climbed across the spikes ,</l>
     <l n="112">And he had squeezed himself betwixt the bars ,</l>
     <l n="113">And he had breathed the Proctor 's dogs ; and one</l>
     <l n="114">Discussed his tutor , rough to common men ,</l>
     <l n="115">But honeying at the whisper of a lord ;</l>
     <l n="116">And one the Master , as a rogue in grain</l>
     <l n="117">Veneered with sanctimonious theory .</l>
     <l n="118">But while they talked , above their heads I saw</l>
     <l n="119">The feudal warrior lady-clad ; which brought</l>
     <l n="120">My book to mind : and opening this I read</l>
     <l n="121">Of old Sir Ralph a page or two that rang</l>
     <l n="122">With tilt and tourney ; then the tale of her</l>
     <l n="123">That drove her foes with slaughter from her walls ,</l>
     <l n="124">And much I praised her nobleness , and ‘ Where , ’</l>
     <l n="125">Asked Walter , patting Lilia 's head ( she lay</l>
     <l n="126">Beside him ) ‘ lives there such a woman now ? ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="127">Quick answered Lilia ‘ There are thousands now</l>
     <l n="128">Such women , but convention beats them down :</l>
     <l n="129">It is but bringing up ; no more than that :</l>
     <l n="130">You men have done it : how I hate you all !</l>
     <l n="131">Ah , were I something great ! I wish I were</l>
     <l n="132">Some might poetess , I would shame you then ,</l>
     <l n="133">That love to keep us children ! O I wish</l>
     <l n="134">That I were some great princess , I would build</l>
     <l n="135">Far off from men a college like a man 's ,</l>
     <l n="136">And I would teach them all that men are taught ;</l>
     <l n="137">We are twice as quick ! ’ And here she shook aside</l>
     <l n="138">The hand that played the patron with her curls .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="139">And one said smiling ‘ Pretty were the sight</l>
     <l n="140">If our old halls could change their sex , and flaunt</l>
     <l n="141">With prudes for proctors , dowagers for deans ,</l>
     <l n="142">And sweet girl-graduates in their golden hair .</l>
     <l n="143">I think they should not wear our rusty gowns ,</l>
     <l n="144">But move as rich as Emperor-moths , or Ralph</l>
     <l n="145">Who shines so in the corner ; yet I fear ,</l>
     <l n="146">If there were many Lilias in the brood ,</l>
     <l n="147">However deep you might embower the nest ,</l>
     <l n="148">Some boy would spy it . ’</l>
     <l n="149">At this upon the sward</l>
     <l n="150">She tapt her tiny silken-sandaled foot :</l>
     <l n="151">‘ That 's your light way ; but I would make it death</l>
     <l n="152">For any male thing but to peep at us . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="153">Petulant she spoke , and at herself she laughed ;</l>
     <l n="154">A rosebud set with little wilful thorns ,</l>
     <l n="155">And sweet as English air could make her , she :</l>
     <l n="156">But Walter hailed a score of names upon her ,</l>
     <l n="157">And ‘ petty Ogress ’ , and ‘ ungrateful Puss ’ ,</l>
     <l n="158">And swore he longed at college , only longed ,</l>
     <l n="159">All else was well , for she-society .</l>
     <l n="160">They boated and they cricketed ; they talked</l>
     <l n="161">At wine , in clubs , of art , of politics ;</l>
     <l n="162">They lost their weeks ; they vext the souls of deans ;</l>
     <l n="163">They rode ; they betted ; made a hundred friends ,</l>
     <l n="164">And caught the blossom of the flying terms ,</l>
     <l n="165">But missed the mignonette of Vivian-place ,</l>
     <l n="166">The little hearth-flower Lilia . Thus he spoke ,</l>
     <l n="167">Part banter , part affection .</l>
     <l n="168">‘ True , ’ she said ,</l>
     <l n="169">‘ We doubt not that . O yes , you missed us much .</l>
     <l n="170">I 'll stake my ruby ring upon it you did . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="171">She held it out ; and as a parrot turns</l>
     <l n="172">Up through gilt wires a crafty loving eye ,</l>
     <l n="173">And takes a lady 's finger with all care ,</l>
     <l n="174">And bites it for true heart and not for harm ,</l>
     <l n="175">So he with Lilia 's . Daintily she shrieked</l>
     <l n="176">And wrung it . ‘ Doubt my word again ! ’ he said .</l>
     <l n="177">‘ Come , listen ! here is proof that you were missed :</l>
     <l n="178">We seven stayed at Christmas up to read ;</l>
     <l n="179">And there we took one tutor as to read :</l>
     <l n="180">The hard-grained Muses of the cube and square</l>
     <l n="181">Were out of season : never man , I think ,</l>
     <l n="182">So mouldered in a sinecure as he :</l>
     <l n="183">For while our cloisters echoed frosty feet ,</l>
     <l n="184">And our long walks were stript as bare as brooms ,</l>
     <l n="185">We did but talk you over , pledge you all</l>
     <l n="186">In wassail ; often , like as many girls —</l>
     <l n="187">Sick for the hollies and the yews of home —</l>
     <l n="188">As many little trifling Lilias — played</l>
     <l n="189">Charades and riddles as at Christmas here ,</l>
     <l n="190">And what 's my thought and when and where and how ,</l>
     <l n="191">As here at Christmas . ’</l>
     <l n="192">She remembered that :</l>
     <l n="193">A pleasant game , she thought : she liked it more</l>
     <l n="194">Than magic music , forfeits , all the rest .</l>
     <l n="195">But these — what kind of tales did men tell men ,</l>
     <l n="196">She wondered , by themselves ?</l>
     <l n="197">A half-disdain</l>
     <l n="198">Perched on the pouted blossom of her lips :</l>
     <l n="199">And Walter nodded at me ; ‘ He began ,</l>
     <l n="200">The rest would follow , each in turn ; and so</l>
     <l n="201">We forged a sevenfold story . Kind ? what kind ?</l>
     <l n="202">Chimeras , crotchets , Christmas solecisms ,</l>
     <l n="203">Seven-headed monsters only made to kill</l>
     <l n="204">Time by the fire in winter . ’</l>
     <l n="205">‘ Kill him now ,</l>
     <l n="206">The tyrant ! kill him in the summer too , ’</l>
     <l n="207">Said Lilia ; ‘ Why not now ? ’ the maiden Aunt .</l>
     <l n="208">‘ Why not a summer 's as a winter 's tale ?</l>
     <l n="209">A tale for summer as befits the time ,</l>
     <l n="210">And something it should be to suit the place ,</l>
     <l n="211">Heroic , for a hero lies beneath ,</l>
     <l n="212">Grave , solemn ! ’</l>
     <l n="213">Walter warped his mouth at this</l>
     <l n="214">To something so mock-solemn , that I laughed</l>
     <l n="215">And Lilia woke with sudden-thrilling mirth</l>
     <l n="216">An echo like a ghostly woodpecker ,</l>
     <l n="217">Hid in the ruins ; till the maiden Aunt</l>
     <l n="218">( A little sense of wrong had touched her face</l>
     <l n="219">With colour ) turned to me with ‘ As you will ;</l>
     <l n="220">Heroic if you will , or what you will ,</l>
     <l n="221">Or be yourself you hero if you will . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="222">‘ Take Lilia , then , for heroine ’ clamoured he ,</l>
     <l n="223">‘ And make her some great Princess , six feet high ,</l>
     <l n="224">Grand , epic , homicidal ; and be you</l>
     <l n="225">The Prince to win her ! ’</l>
     <l n="226">‘ Then follow me , the Prince , ’</l>
     <l n="227">I answered , ‘ each be hero in his turn !</l>
     <l n="228">Seven and yet one , like shadows in a dream .—</l>
     <l n="229">Heroic seems our Princess as required —</l>
     <l n="230">But something made to suit with Time and place ,</l>
     <l n="231">A Gothic ruin and a Grecian house ,</l>
     <l n="232">A talk of college and of ladies ’ rights ,</l>
     <l n="233">A feudal knight in silken masquerade ,</l>
     <l n="234">And , yonder , shrieks and strange experiments</l>
     <l n="235">For which the good Sir Ralph had burnt them all —</l>
     <l n="236">This were a medley ! we should have him back</l>
     <l n="237">Who told the “ Winter 's tale ” to do it for us .</l>
     <l n="238">No matter : we will say whatever comes .</l>
     <l n="239">And let the ladies sing us , if they will ,</l>
     <l n="240">From time to time , some ballad or a song</l>
     <l n="241">To give us breathing-space . ’</l>
     <l n="242">So I began ,</l>
     <l n="243">And the rest followed : and the women sang</l>
     <l n="244">Between the rougher voices of the men ,</l>
     <l n="245">Like linnets in the pauses of the wind :</l>
     <l n="246">And here I give the story and the songs .</l>

      <l n="256">Should come to fight with shadows and to fall .</l>
      <l n="257">For so , my mother said , the story ran .</l>
      <l n="258">And , truly , waking dreams were , more or less ,</l>
      <l n="259">An old and strange affection of the house .</l>
      <l n="260">Myself too had weird seizures , Heaven knows what :</l>
      <l n="261">On a sudden in the midst of men and day ,</l>
      <l n="262">And while I walked and talked as heretofore ,</l>
      <l n="263">I seemed to move among a world of ghosts ,</l>
      <l n="264">And feel myself the shadow of a dream .</l>
      <l n="265">Our great court-Galen poised his gilt-head cane ,</l>
      <l n="266">And pawed his beard , and muttered ‘ catalepsy ’ .</l>
      <l n="267">My mother pitying made a thousand prayers ;</l>
      <l n="268">My mother was as mild as any saint ,</l>
      <l n="269">Half-canonized by all that looked on her ,</l>
      <l n="270">So gracious was her tact and tenderness :</l>
      <l n="271">But my good father thought a king a king ;</l>
      <l n="272">He cared not for the affection of the house ;</l>
      <l n="273">He held his sceptre like a pedant 's wand</l>
      <l n="274">To lash offence , and with long arms and hands</l>
      <l n="275">Reached out , and picked offenders from the mass</l>
      <l n="276">For judgment .</l>
      <l n="277">Now it chanced that I had been ,</l>
      <l n="278">While life was yet in bud and blade , bethrothed</l>
      <l n="279">To one , a neighbouring Princess : she to me</l>
      <l n="280">Was proxy-wedded with a bootless calf</l>
      <l n="281">At eight years old ; and still from time to time</l>
      <l n="282">Came murmurs of her beauty from the South ,</l>
      <l n="283">And of her brethren , youths of puissance ;</l>
      <l n="284">And still I wore her picture by my heart ,</l>
      <l n="285">And one dark tress ; and all around them both</l>
      <l n="286">Sweet thoughts would swarm as bees about their queen .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="14">
      <l n="287">But when the days drew nigh that I should wed ,</l>
      <l n="288">My father sent ambassadors with furs</l>
      <l n="289">And jewels , gifts , to fetch her : these brought back</l>
      <l n="290">A present , a great labour of the loom ;</l>
      <l n="291">And therewithal an answer vague as wind :</l>
      <l n="292">Besides , they saw the king ; he took the gifts ;</l>
      <l n="293">He said there was a compact ; that was true :</l>
      <l n="294">But then she had a will ; was he to blame ?</l>
      <l n="295">And maiden fancies ; loved to live alone</l>
      <l n="296">Among her women ; certain , would not wed .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="15">
      <l n="297">That morning in the presence room I stood</l>
      <l n="298">With Cyril and with Florian , my two friends :</l>
      <l n="299">The first , a gentleman of broken means</l>
      <l n="300">( His father 's fault ) but given to starts and bursts</l>
      <l n="301">Of revel ; and the last , my other heart ,</l>
      <l n="302">And almost my half-self , for still we moved</l>
      <l n="303">Together , twinned as horse 's ear and eye .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="16">
      <l n="304">Now , while they spake , I saw my father 's face</l>
      <l n="305">Grow long and troubled like a rising moon ,</l>
      <l n="306">Inflamed with wrath : he started on his feet ,</l>
      <l n="307">Tore the king 's letter , snowed it down , and rent</l>
      <l n="308">The wonder of the loom through warp and woof</l>
      <l n="309">From skirt to skirt ; and at the last he sware</l>
      <l n="310">That he would send a hundred thousand men ,</l>
      <l n="311">And bring her in a whirlwind : then he chewed</l>
      <l n="312">The thrice-turned cud of wrath , and cooked his spleen ,</l>
      <l n="313">Communing with his captains of the war .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="17">
      <l n="314">At last I spoke . ‘ My father , let me go .</l>
      <l n="315">It cannot be but some gross error lies</l>
      <l n="316">In this report , this answer of a king ,</l>
      <l n="317">Whom all men rate as kind and hospitable :</l>
      <l n="318">Or , maybe , I myself , my bride once seen ,</l>
      <l n="319">Whate'er my grief to find her less than fame ,</l>
      <l n="320">May rue the bargain made . ’ And Florian said :</l>
      <l n="321">‘ I have a sister at the foreign court ,</l>
      <l n="322">Who moves about the Princess ; she , you know ,</l>
      <l n="323">Who wedded with a nobleman from thence :</l>
      <l n="324">He , dying lately , left her , as I hear ,</l>
      <l n="325">The lady of three castles in that land :</l>
      <l n="326">Through her this matter might be sifted clean . ’</l>
      <l n="327">And Cyril whispered : ‘ Take me with you too . ’</l>
      <l n="328">Then laughing ‘ what , if these weird seizures come</l>
      <l n="329">Upon you in those lands , and no one near</l>
      <l n="330">To point you out the shadow from the truth !</l>
      <l n="331">Take me : I 'll serve you better in a strait ;</l>
      <l n="332">I grate on rusty hinges here : ’ but ‘ No ! ’</l>
      <l n="333">Roared the rough king , ‘ you shall not ; we ourself</l>
      <l n="334">Will crush her pretty maiden fancies dead</l>
      <l n="335">In iron gauntlets : break the council up . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="18">
      <l n="336">But when the council broke , I rose and past</l>
      <l n="337">Through the wild woods that hung about the town ;</l>
      <l n="338">Found a still place , and plucked her likeness out ;</l>
      <l n="339">Laid it on flowers , and watched it lying bathed</l>
      <l n="340">In the green gleam of dewy-tasselled trees :</l>
      <l n="341">What were those fancies ? wherefore break her troth ?</l>
      <l n="342">Proud looked the lips : but while I meditated</l>
      <l n="343">A wind arose and rushed upon the South ,</l>
      <l n="344">And shook the songs , the whispers , and the shrieks</l>
      <l n="345">Of the wild woods together ; and a Voice</l>
      <l n="346">Went with it , ‘ Follow , follow , thou shalt win . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="19">
      <l n="347">Then , ere the silver sickle of that month</l>
      <l n="348">Became her golden shield , I stole from court</l>
      <l n="349">With Cyril and with Florian , unperceived ,</l>
      <l n="350">Cat-footed through the town and half in dread</l>
      <l n="351">To hear my father 's clamour at our backs</l>
      <l n="352">With Ho ! from some bay-window shake the night ;</l>
      <l n="353">But all was quiet : from the bastioned walls</l>
      <l n="354">Like threaded spiders , one by one , we dropt ,</l>
      <l n="355">And flying reached the frontier : then we crost</l>
      <l n="356">To a livelier land ; and so by tilth and grange ,</l>
      <l n="357">And vines , and blowing bosks of wilderness ,</l>
      <l n="358">We gained the mother city thick with towers ,</l>
      <l n="359">And in the imperial palace found the king .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="20">
      <l n="360">His name was Gama ; cracked and small his voice ,</l>
      <l n="361">But bland the smile that like a wrinkling wind</l>
      <l n="362">On glassy water drove his cheek in lines ;</l>
      <l n="363">A little dry old man , without a star ,</l>
      <l n="364">Not like a king : three days he feasted us ,</l>
      <l n="365">And on the fourth I spake of why we came ,</l>
      <l n="366">And my bethrothed . ‘ You do us , Prince , ’ he said ,</l>
      <l n="367">Airing a snowy hand and signet gem ,</l>
      <l n="368">‘ All honour . We remember love ourselves</l>
      <l n="369">In our sweet youth : there did a compact pass</l>
      <l n="370">Long summers back , a kind of ceremony —</l>
      <l n="371">I think the year in which our olives failed .</l>
      <l n="372">I would you had her , Prince , with all my heart ,</l>
      <l n="373">With my full heart : but there were widows here ,</l>
      <l n="374">Two widows , Lady Psyche , Lady Blanche ;</l>
      <l n="375">They fed her theories , in and out of place</l>
      <l n="376">Maintaining that with equal husbandry</l>
      <l n="377">The woman were an equal to the man .</l>
      <l n="378">They harped on this ; with this our banquets rang ;</l>
      <l n="379">Our dances broke and buzzed in knots of talk ;</l>
      <l n="380">Nothing but this ; my very ears were hot</l>
      <l n="381">To hear them : knowledge , so my daughter held ,</l>
      <l n="382">Was all in all : they had but been , she thought ,</l>
      <l n="383">As children ; they must lose the child , assume</l>
      <l n="384">The woman : then , Sir , awful odes she wrote ,</l>
      <l n="385">Too awful , sure , for what they treated of ,</l>
      <l n="386">But all she is and does is awful ; odes</l>
      <l n="387">About this losing of the child ; and rhymes</l>
      <l n="388">And dismal lyrics , prophesying change</l>
      <l n="389">Beyond all reason : these the women sang ;</l>
      <l n="390">And they that know such things — I sought but peace ;</l>
      <l n="391">No critic I — would call them masterpieces :</l>
      <l n="392">They mastered me . At last she begged a boon ,</l>
      <l n="393">A certain summer-palace which I have</l>
      <l n="394">Hard by your father 's frontier : I said no ,</l>
      <l n="395">Yet being an easy man , gave it : and there ,</l>
      <l n="396">All wild to found an University</l>
      <l n="397">For maidens , on the spur she fled ; and more</l>
      <l n="398">We know not ,— only this : they see no men ,</l>
      <l n="399">Not even her brother Arac , nor the twins</l>
      <l n="400">Her brethren , though they love her , look upon her</l>
      <l n="401">As on a kind of paragon ; and I</l>
      <l n="402">( Pardon me saying it ) were much loth to breed</l>
      <l n="403">Dispute betwixt myself and mine : but since</l>
      <l n="404">( And I confess with right ) you think me bound</l>
      <l n="405">In some sort , I can give you letters to her ;</l>
      <l n="406">And yet , to speak the truth , I rate your chance</l>
      <l n="407">Almost at naked nothing . ’</l>
      <l n="408">Thus the king ;</l>
      <l n="409">And I , though nettled that he seemed to slur</l>
      <l n="410">With garrulous ease and oily courtesies</l>
      <l n="411">Our formal compact , yet , not less ( all frets</l>
      <l n="412">But chafing me on fire to find my bride )</l>
      <l n="413">Went forth again with both my friends . We rode</l>
      <l n="414">Many a long league back to the North . At last</l>
      <l n="415">From hills , that looked across a land of hope ,</l>
      <l n="416">We dropt with evening on a rustic town</l>
      <l n="417">Set in a gleaming river 's crescent-curve ,</l>
      <l n="418">Close at the boundary of the liberties ;</l>
      <l n="419">There , entered an old hostel , called mine host</l>
      <l n="420">To council , plied him with his richest wines ,</l>
      <l n="421">And showed the late-writ letters of the king .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="21">
      <l n="422">He with a long low sibilation , stared</l>
      <l n="423">As blank as death in marble ; then exclaimed</l>
      <l n="424">Averring it was clear against all rules</l>
      <l n="425">For any man to go : but as his brain</l>
      <l n="426">Began to mellow , ‘ If the king , ’ he said ,</l>
      <l n="427">‘ Had given us letters , was he bound to speak ?</l>
      <l n="428">The king would bear him out ; ’ and at the last —</l>
      <l n="429">The summer of the vine in all his veins —</l>
      <l n="430">‘ No doubt that we might make it worth his while .</l>
      <l n="431">She once had past that way ; he heard her speak ;</l>
      <l n="432">She scared him ; life ! he never saw the like ;</l>
      <l n="433">She looked as grand as doomsday and as grave :</l>
      <l n="434">And he , he reverenced his liege-lady there ;</l>
      <l n="435">He always made a point to post with mares ;</l>
      <l n="436">His daughter and his housemaid were the boys :</l>
      <l n="437">The land , he understood , for miles about</l>
      <l n="438">Was tilled by women ; all the swine were sows ,</l>
      <l n="439">And all the dogs ’ —</l>
      <l n="440">But while he jested thus ,</l>
      <l n="441">A thought flashed through me which I clothed in act ,</l>
      <l n="442">Remembering how we three presented Maid</l>
      <l n="443">Or Nymph , or Goddess , at high tide of feast ,</l>
      <l n="444">In masque or pageant at my father 's court .</l>
      <l n="445">We sent mine host to purchase female gear ;</l>
      <l n="446">He brought it , and himself , a sight to shake</l>
      <l n="447">The midriff of despair with laughter , holp</l>
      <l n="448">To lace us up , till , each , in maiden plumes</l>
      <l n="449">We rustled : him we gave a costly bribe</l>
      <l n="450">To guerdon silence , mounted our good steeds ,</l>
      <l n="451">And boldly ventured on the liberties .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="22">
      <l n="452">We followed up the river as we rode ,</l>

      <l n="455">And linden alley : then we past an arch ,</l>
      <l n="456">Whereon a woman-statue rose with wings</l>
      <l n="457">From four winged horses dark against the stars ;</l>
      <l n="458">And some inscription ran along the front ,</l>

      <l n="465">In meshes of the jasmine and the rose :</l>

   <p>She ended here , and beckoned us : the rest Parted ; and , glowing full-faced welcome , she Began to address us , and was moving on In gratulation , till as when a boat Tacks , and the slackened sail flaps , all her voice Faltering and fluttering in her throat , she cried ‘ My brother ! ’ ‘ Well , my sister . ’ ‘ O , ’ she said , ‘ What do you here ? and in this dress ? and these ? Why who are these ? a wolf within the fold ! A pack of wolves ! the Lord be gracious to me ! A plot , a plot , a plot to ruin all ! ’ ‘ No plot , no plot , ’ he answered . ‘ Wretched boy , How saw you not the inscription on the gate , LET NO MAN ENTER IN ON PAIN OF DEATH ? ’ ‘ And if I had , ’ he answered , ‘ who could think The softer Adams of your Academe , O sister , Sirens though they be , were such As chanted on the blanching bones of men ? ’ ‘ But you will find it otherwise ’ she said . ‘ You jest : ill jesting with edge-tools ! my vow Binds me to speak , and O that iron will , That axelike edge unturnable , our Head , The Princess . ’ ‘ Well then , Psyche , take my life , And nail me like a weasel on a grange For warning : bury me beside the gate , And cut this epitaph above my bones ; Here lies a brother by a sister slain , All for the common good of womankind . ’ ‘ Let me die too , ’ said Cyril , ‘ having seen And heard the Lady Psyche . ’ I struck in : ‘ Albeit so masked , Madam , I love the truth ; Receive it ; and in me behold the Prince Your countryman , affianced years ago To the Lady Ida : here , for here she was , And thus ( what other way was left ) I came . ’ ‘ O Sir , O Prince , I have no country ; none ; If any , this ; but none . Whate'er I was Disrooted , what I am is grafted here . Affianced , Sir ? love-whispers may not breathe Within this vestal limit , and how should I , Who am not mine , say , live : the thunderbolt Hangs silent ; but prepare : I speak ; it falls . ’ ‘ Yet pause , ’ I said : ‘ for that inscription there , I think no more of deadly lurks therein , Than in a clapper clapping in a garth , To scare the fowl from fruit : if more there be , If more and acted on , what follows ? war ; Your own work marred : for this your Academe , Whichever side be Victor , in the halloo Will topple to the trumpet down , and pass With all fair theories only made to gild A stormless summer . ’ ‘ Let the Princess judge Of that ’ she said : ‘ farewell , Sir — and to you . I shudder at the sequel , but I go . ’</p>

     <l n="126">We turned to go , but Cyril took the child ,</l>
     <l n="127">And held her round the knees against his waist ,</l>
     <l n="128">And blew the swollen cheek of a trumpeter ,</l>
     <l n="129">While Psyche watched them , smiling , and the child</l>
     <l n="130">Pushed her flat hand against his face and laughed ;</l>
     <l n="131">And thus our conference closed .</l>
     <l n="132">And then we strolled</l>
     <l n="133">For half the day through stately theatres</l>
     <l n="134">Benched crescent-wise . In each we sat , we heard</l>
     <l n="135">The grave Professor . On the lecture slate</l>
     <l n="136">The circle rounded under female hands</l>
     <l n="137">With flawless demonstration : followed then</l>
     <l n="138">A classic lecture , rich in sentiment ,</l>
     <l n="139">With scraps of thunderous Epic lilted out</l>
     <l n="140">By violet-hooded Doctors , elegies</l>
     <l n="141">And quoted odes , and jewels five-words-long</l>
     <l n="142">That on the stretched forefinger of all Time</l>
     <l n="143">Sparkle for ever : then we dipt in all</l>
     <l n="144">That treats of whatsoever is , the state ,</l>
     <l n="145">The total chronicles of man , the mind ,</l>
     <l n="146">The morals , something of the frame , the rock ,</l>
     <l n="147">The star , the bird , the fish , the shell , the flower ,</l>
     <l n="148">Electric , chemic laws , and all the rest ,</l>
     <l n="149">And whatsoever can be taught and known ;</l>
     <l n="150">Till like three horses that have broken fence ,</l>
     <l n="151">And glutted all night long breast-deep in corn ,</l>
     <l n="152">We issued gorged with knowledge , and I spoke :</l>
     <l n="153">‘ Why , Sirs , they do all this as well as we . ’</l>
     <l n="154">‘ They hunt old trails ’ said Cyril ‘ very well ;</l>

     <l n="156">‘ Ungracious ! ’ answered Florian ; ‘ have you learnt</l>
     <l n="157">No more from Psyche 's lecture , you that talked</l>
     <l n="158">The trash that made me sick , and almost sad ? ’</l>
     <l n="159">‘ O trash ’ he said , ‘ but with a kernel in it .</l>
     <l n="160">Should I not call her wise , who made me wise ?</l>

     <l n="162">Than in my brainpan were an empty hull ,</l>
     <l n="163">And every Muse tumbled a science in .</l>
     <l n="164">A thousand hearts lie fallow in these halls ,</l>
     <l n="165">And round these halls a thousand baby loves</l>
     <l n="166">Fly twanging headless arrows at the hearts ,</l>
     <l n="167">Whence follows many a vacant pang ; but O</l>
     <l n="168">With me , Sir , entered in the bigger boy ,</l>
     <l n="169">The Head of all the golden-shafted firm ,</l>
     <l n="170">The long-limbed lad that had a Psyche too ;</l>
     <l n="171">He cleft me through the stomacher ; and now</l>
     <l n="172">What think you of it , Florian ? do I chase</l>
     <l n="173">The substance or the shadow ? will it hold ?</l>
     <l n="174">I have no sorcerer 's malison on me ,</l>
     <l n="175">No ghostly hauntings like his Highness . I</l>
     <l n="176">Flatter myself that always everywhere</l>
     <l n="177">I know the substance when I see it . Well ,</l>
     <l n="178">Are castles shadows ? Three of them ? Is she</l>
     <l n="179">The sweet proprietress a shadow ? If not ,</l>
     <l n="180">Shall those three castles patch my tattered coat ?</l>
     <l n="181">For dear are those three castles to my wants ,</l>
     <l n="182">And dear is sister Psyche to my heart ,</l>
     <l n="183">And two dear things are one of double worth ,</l>
     <l n="184">And much I might have said , but that my zone</l>
     <l n="185">Unmanned me : then the Doctors ! O to hear</l>
     <l n="186">The Doctors ! O to watch the thirsty plants</l>
     <l n="187">Imbibing ! once or twice I thought to roar ,</l>
     <l n="188">To break my chain , to shake my mane : but thou ,</l>
     <l n="189">Modulate me , Soul of mincing mimicry !</l>
     <l n="190">Make liquid treble of that bassoon , my throat ;</l>
     <l n="191">Abase those eyes that ever loved to meet</l>
     <l n="192">Star-sisters answering under crescent brows ;</l>
     <l n="193">Abate the stride , which speaks of man , and loose</l>
     <l n="194">A flying charm of blushes o'er this cheek ,</l>
     <l n="195">Where they like swallows coming out of time</l>

     <l n="197">For dinner , let us go ! ’</l>
     <l n="198">And in we streamed</l>
     <l n="199">Among the columns , pacing staid and still</l>
     <l n="200">By twos and threes , till all from end to end</l>
     <l n="201">With beauties every shade of brown and fair</l>
     <l n="202">In colours gayer than the morning mist ,</l>
     <l n="203">The long hall glittered like a bed of flowers .</l>
     <l n="204">How might a man not wander from his wits</l>
     <l n="205">Pierced through with eyes , but that I kept mine own</l>
     <l n="206">Intent on her , who rapt in glorious dreams ,</l>

     <l n="210">A clamour thickened , mixt with inmost terms</l>
     <l n="211">Of art and science : Lady Blanche alone</l>
     <l n="212">Of faded form and haughtiest lineaments ,</l>
     <l n="213">With all her autumn tresses falsely brown ,</l>
     <l n="214">Shot sidelong daggers at us , a tiger-cat</l>
     <l n="215">In act to spring .</l>
     <l n="216">At last a solemn grace</l>
     <l n="217">Concluded , and we sought the gardens : there</l>

     <l n="219">In this hand held a volume as to read ,</l>
     <l n="220">And smoothed a petted peacock down with that :</l>
     <l n="221">Some to a low song oared a shallop by ,</l>
     <l n="222">Or under arches of the marble bridge</l>
     <l n="223">Hung , shadowed from the heat : some hid and sought</l>
     <l n="224">In the orange thickets : others tost a ball</l>
     <l n="225">Above the fountain-jets , and back again</l>
     <l n="226">With laughter : others lay about the lawns ,</l>
     <l n="227">Of the older sort , and murmured that their May</l>
     <l n="228">Was passing : what was learning unto them ?</l>
     <l n="229">They wished to marry ; they could rule a house ;</l>
     <l n="230">Men hated learned women : but we three</l>

     <l n="232">Melissa hitting all we saw with shafts</l>
     <l n="233">Of gentle satire , kin to charity ,</l>
     <l n="234">That harmed not : then day droopt ; the chapel bells</l>
     <l n="235">Called us : we left the walks ; we mixt with those</l>

     <l n="237">Before two streams of light from wall to wall ,</l>
     <l n="238">While the great organ almost burst his pipes ,</l>
     <l n="239">Groaning for power , and rolling through the court</l>
     <l n="240">A long melodious thunder to the sound</l>
     <l n="241">Of solemn psalms , and silver litanies ,</l>

      <l n="1211">Now , scarce three paces measured from the mound ,</l>
      <l n="1212">We stumbled on a stationary voice ,</l>
      <l n="1213">And ‘ Stand , who goes ? ’ ‘ Two from the palace ’ I .</l>
      <l n="1214">‘ The second two : they wait , ’ he said , ‘ pass on ;</l>
      <l n="1215">His Highness wakes : ’ and one , that clashed in arms ,</l>
      <l n="1216">By glimmering lanes and walls of canvas led</l>
      <l n="1217">Threading the soldier-city , till we heard</l>
      <l n="1218">The drowsy folds of our great ensign shake</l>
      <l n="1219">From blazoned lions o'er the imperial tent</l>
      <l n="1220">Whispers of war .</l>
      <l n="1221">Entering , the sudden light</l>
      <l n="1222">Dazed me half-blind : I stood and seemed to hear ,</l>
      <l n="1223">As in a poplar grove when a light wind wakes</l>
      <l n="1224">A lisping of the innumerous leaf and dies ,</l>
      <l n="1225">Each hissing in his neighbour 's ear ; and then</l>
      <l n="1226">A strangled titter , out of which there brake</l>
      <l n="1227">On all sides , clamouring etiquette to death ,</l>
      <l n="1228">Unmeasured mirth ; while now the two old kings</l>
      <l n="1229">Began to wag their baldness up and down ,</l>
      <l n="1230">The fresh young captains flashed their glittering teeth ,</l>
      <l n="1231">The huge bush-bearded Barons heaved and blew ,</l>
      <l n="1232">And slain with laughter rolled the gilded Squire .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="66">
      <l n="1233">At length my Sire , his rough cheek wet with tears ,</l>
      <l n="1234">Panted from weary sides ‘ King , you are free !</l>
      <l n="1235">We did but keep you surety for our son ,</l>
      <l n="1236">If this be he ,— or a dragged mawkin , thou ,</l>
      <l n="1237">That tends to her bristled grunters in the sludge : ’</l>
      <l n="1238">For I was drenched with ooze , and torn with briers ,</l>
      <l n="1239">More crumpled than a poppy from the sheath ,</l>
      <l n="1240">And all one rag , disprinced from head to heel .</l>
      <l n="1241">Then some one sent beneath his vaulted palm</l>
      <l n="1242">A whispered jest to some one near him , ‘ Look ,</l>
      <l n="1243">He has been among his shadows . ’ ‘ Satan take</l>
      <l n="1244">The old women and their shadows ! ( thus the King</l>
      <l n="1245">Roared ) make yourself a man to fight with men .</l>
      <l n="1246">Go : Cyril told us all . ’</l>
      <l n="1247">As boys that slink</l>
      <l n="1248">From ferule and the trespass-chiding eye ,</l>
      <l n="1249">Away we stole , and transient in a trice</l>
      <l n="1250">From what was left of faded woman-slough</l>
      <l n="1251">To sheathing splendours and the golden scale</l>
      <l n="1252">Of harness , issued in the sun , that now</l>
      <l n="1253">Leapt from the dewy shoulders of the Earth ,</l>
      <l n="1254">And hit the Northern hills . Here Cyril met us .</l>
      <l n="1255">A little shy at first , but by and by</l>
      <l n="1256">We twain , with mutual pardon asked and given</l>
      <l n="1257">For stroke and song , resoldered peace , whereon</l>
      <l n="1258">Followed his tale . Amazed he fled away</l>
      <l n="1259">Through the dark land , and later in the night</l>
      <l n="1260">Had come on Psyche weeping : ‘ then we fell</l>
      <l n="1261">Into your father 's hand , and there she lies ,</l>
      <l n="1262">But will not speak , or stir . ’</l>
      <l n="1263">He showed a tent</l>
      <l n="1264">A stone-shot off : we entered in , and there</l>
      <l n="1265">Among piled arms and rough accoutrements ,</l>
      <l n="1266">Pitiful sight , wrapped in a soldier 's cloak ,</l>
      <l n="1267">Like some sweet sculpture draped from head to foot ,</l>
      <l n="1268">And pushed by rude hands from its pedestal ,</l>
      <l n="1269">All her fair length upon the ground she lay :</l>
      <l n="1270">And at her head a follower of the camp ,</l>
      <l n="1271">A charred and wrinkled piece of womanhood ,</l>
      <l n="1272">Sat watching like the watcher by the dead .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="67">
      <l n="1273">Then Florian knelt , and ‘ Come ’ he whispered to her ,</l>
      <l n="1274">‘ Lift up your head , sweet sister : lie not thus .</l>
      <l n="1275">What have you done but right ? you could not slay</l>
      <l n="1276">Me , nor your prince : look up : be comforted :</l>
      <l n="1277">Sweet is it to have done the thing one ought ,</l>
      <l n="1278">When fallen in darker ways . ’ And likewise I :</l>
      <l n="1279">‘ Be comforted : have I not lost her too ,</l>
      <l n="1280">In whose least act abides the nameless charm</l>
      <l n="1281">That none has else for me ? ’ She heard , she moved ,</l>
      <l n="1282">She moaned , a folded voice ; and up she sat ,</l>
      <l n="1283">And raised the cloak from brows as pale and smooth</l>
      <l n="1284">As those that mourn half-shrouded over death</l>
      <l n="1285">In deathless marble . ‘ Her , ’ she said , ‘ my friend —</l>
      <l n="1286">Parted from her — betrayed her cause and mine —</l>
      <l n="1287">Where shall I breathe ? why kept ye not your faith ?</l>
      <l n="1288">O base and bad ! what comfort ? none for me ! ’</l>
      <l n="1289">To whom remorseful Cyril , ‘ Yet I pray</l>
      <l n="1290">Take comfort : live , dear lady , for your child ! ’</l>
      <l n="1291">At which she lifted up her voice and cried .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="68">
      <l n="1292">‘ Ah me , my babe , my blossom , ah , my child ,</l>
      <l n="1293">My one sweet child , whom I shall see no more !</l>
      <l n="1294">For now will cruel Ida keep her back ;</l>
      <l n="1295">And either she will die from want of care ,</l>
      <l n="1296">Or sicken with ill-usage , when they say</l>
      <l n="1297">The child is hers — for every little fault ,</l>
      <l n="1298">The child is hers ; and they will beat my girl</l>
      <l n="1299">Remembering her mother : O my flower !</l>
      <l n="1300">Or they will take her , they will make her hard ,</l>
      <l n="1301">And she will pass me by in after-life</l>
      <l n="1302">With some cold reverence worse than were she dead .</l>
      <l n="1303">Ill mother that I was to leave her there ,</l>
      <l n="1304">To lag behind , scared by the cry they made ,</l>
      <l n="1305">The horror of the shame among them all :</l>
      <l n="1306">But I will go and sit beside the doors ,</l>
      <l n="1307">And make a wild petition night and day ,</l>
      <l n="1308">Until they hate to hear me like a wind</l>
      <l n="1309">Wailing for ever , till they open to me ,</l>
      <l n="1310">And lay my little blossom at my feet ,</l>
      <l n="1311">My babe , my sweet Aglaïa , my one child :</l>
      <l n="1312">And I will take her up and go my way ,</l>
      <l n="1313">And satisfy my soul with kissing her :</l>
      <l n="1314">Ah ! what might that man not deserve of me</l>
      <l n="1315">Who gave me back my child ? ’ ‘ Be comforted , ’</l>
      <l n="1316">Said Cyril , ‘ you shall have it : ’ but again</l>
      <l n="1317">She veiled her brows , and prone she sank , and so</l>
      <l n="1318">Like tender things that being caught feign death ,</l>
      <l n="1319">Spoke not , nor stirred .</l>
      <l n="1320">By this a murmur ran</l>
      <l n="1321">Through all the camp and inward raced the scouts</l>
      <l n="1322">With rumour of Prince Arab hard at hand .</l>
      <l n="1323">We left her by the woman , and without</l>
      <l n="1324">Found the gray kings at parle : and ‘ Look you ’ cried</l>
      <l n="1325">My father ‘ that our compact be fulfilled :</l>
      <l n="1326">You have spoilt this child ; she laughs at you and man :</l>
      <l n="1327">She wrongs herself , her sex , and me , and him :</l>
      <l n="1328">But red-faced war has rods of steel and fire ;</l>
      <l n="1329">She yields , or war . ’</l>
      <l n="1330">Then Gama turned to me :</l>
      <l n="1331">‘ We fear , indeed , you spent a stormy time</l>
      <l n="1332">With our strange girl : and yet they say that still</l>
      <l n="1333">You love her . Give us , then , your mind at large :</l>
      <l n="1334">How say you , war or not ? ’</l>
      <l n="1335">‘ Not war , if possible ,</l>
      <l n="1336">O king , ’ I said , ‘ lest from the abuse of war ,</l>
      <l n="1337">The desecrated shrine , the trampled year ,</l>
      <l n="1338">The smouldering homestead , and the household flower</l>
      <l n="1339">Torn from the lintel — all the common wrong —</l>
      <l n="1340">A smoke go up through which I loom to her</l>
      <l n="1341">Three times a monster : now she lightens scorn</l>
      <l n="1342">At him that mars her plan , but then would hate</l>
      <l n="1343">( And every voice she talked with ratify it ,</l>
      <l n="1344">And every face she looked on justify it )</l>
      <l n="1345">The general foe . More soluble is this knot ,</l>
      <l n="1346">By gentleness than war . I want her love .</l>
      <l n="1347">What were I nigher this although we dashed</l>
      <l n="1348">Your cities into shards with catapults ,</l>
      <l n="1349">She would not love ;— or brought her chained , a slave ,</l>
      <l n="1350">The lifting of whose eyelash is my lord ,</l>
      <l n="1351">Not ever would she love ; but brooding turn</l>
      <l n="1352">The book of scorn , till all my flitting chance</l>
      <l n="1353">Were caught within the record of her wrongs ,</l>
      <l n="1354">And crushed to death : and rather , Sire , than this</l>
      <l n="1355">I would the old God of war himself were dead ,</l>
      <l n="1356">Forgotten , rusting on his iron hills ,</l>
      <l n="1357">Rotting on some wild shore with ribs of wreck ,</l>
      <l n="1358">Or like an old-world mammoth bulked in ice ,</l>
      <l n="1359">Not to be molten out . ’</l>
      <l n="1360">And roughly spake</l>
      <l n="1361">My father , ‘ Tut , you know them not , the girls .</l>
      <l n="1362">Boy , when I hear you prate I almost think</l>
      <l n="1363">That idiot legend credible . Look you , Sir !</l>
      <l n="1364">Man is the hunter ; woman is his game :</l>
      <l n="1365">The sleek and shining creatures of the chase ,</l>
      <l n="1366">We hunt them for the beauty of their skins ;</l>
      <l n="1367">They love us for it , and we ride them down .</l>
      <l n="1368">Wheedling and siding with them ! Out ! for shame !</l>
      <l n="1369">Boy , there 's no rose that 's half so dear to them</l>
      <l n="1370">As he that does the thing they dare not do ,</l>
      <l n="1371">Breathing and sounding beauteous battle , comes</l>
      <l n="1372">With the air of the trumpet round him , and leaps in</l>
      <l n="1373">Among the women , snares them by the score</l>
      <l n="1374">Flattered and flustered , wins , though dashed with death</l>
      <l n="1375">He reddens what he kisses : thus I won</l>
      <l n="1376">You mother , a good mother , a good wife ,</l>
      <l n="1377">Worth winning ; but this firebrand — gentleness</l>
      <l n="1378">To such as her ! if Cyril spake her true ,</l>
      <l n="1379">To catch a dragon in a cherry net ,</l>
      <l n="1380">To trip a tigress with a gossamer</l>
      <l n="1381">Were wisdom to it . ’</l>
      <l n="1382">‘ Yea but Sire , ’ I cried ,</l>
      <l n="1383">‘ Wild natures need wise curbs . The soldier ? No :</l>
      <l n="1384">What dares not Ida do that she should prize</l>
      <l n="1385">The soldier ? I beheld her , when she rose</l>
      <l n="1386">The yesternight , and storming in extremes ,</l>
      <l n="1387">Stood for her cause , and flung defiance down</l>
      <l n="1388">Gagelike to man , and had not shunned the death ,</l>
      <l n="1389">No , not the soldier 's : yet I hold her , king ,</l>
      <l n="1390">True woman : you clash them all in one ,</l>
      <l n="1391">That have as many differences as we .</l>
      <l n="1392">The violet varies from the lily as far</l>
      <l n="1393">As oak from elm : one loves the soldier , one</l>
      <l n="1394">The silken priest of peace , one this , one that ,</l>
      <l n="1395">And some unworthily ; their sinless faith ,</l>
      <l n="1396">A maiden moon that sparkles on a sty ,</l>
      <l n="1397">Glorifying clown and satyr ; whence they need</l>
      <l n="1398">More breadth of culture : is not Ida right ?</l>
      <l n="1399">They worth it ? truer to the law within ?</l>
      <l n="1400">Severer in the logic of a life ?</l>
      <l n="1401">Twice as magnetic to sweet influences</l>
      <l n="1402">Of earth and heaven ? and she of whom you speak ,</l>
      <l n="1403">My mother , looks as whole as some serene</l>
      <l n="1404">Creation minted in the golden moods</l>
      <l n="1405">Of sovereign artists ; not a thought , a touch ,</l>
      <l n="1406">But pure as lines of green that streak the white</l>
      <l n="1407">Of the first snowdrop 's inner leaves ; I say ,</l>
      <l n="1408">Not like the piebald miscellany , man ,</l>
      <l n="1409">Bursts of great heart and slips in sensual mire ,</l>
      <l n="1410">But whole and one : and take them all-in-all ,</l>
      <l n="1411">Were we ourselves but half as good , as kind ,</l>
      <l n="1412">As truthful , much that Ida claims as right</l>
      <l n="1413">Had ne'er been mooted , but as frankly theirs</l>
      <l n="1414">As dues of Nature . To our point : not war :</l>
      <l n="1415">Lest I lose all . ’</l>
      <l n="1416">‘ Nay , nay , you spake but sense ’</l>
      <l n="1417">Said Gama . ‘ We remember love ourself</l>
      <l n="1418">In our sweet youth ; we did not rate him then</l>
      <l n="1419">This red-hot iron to be shaped with blows .</l>
      <l n="1420">You talk almost like Ida : she can talk ;</l>
      <l n="1421">And there is something in it as you say :</l>
      <l n="1422">But you talk kindlier : we esteem you for it .—</l>
      <l n="1423">He seems a gracious and a gallant Prince ,</l>
      <l n="1424">I would he had our daughter : for the rest ,</l>
      <l n="1425">Our own detention , why , the causes weighed ,</l>
      <l n="1426">Fatherly fears — you used us courteously —</l>
      <l n="1427">We would do much to gratify your Prince —</l>
      <l n="1428">We pardon it ; and for your ingress here</l>
      <l n="1429">Upon the skirt and fringe of our fair land ,</l>
      <l n="1430">you did but come as goblins in the night ,</l>
      <l n="1431">Nor in the furrow broke the ploughman 's head ,</l>
      <l n="1432">Nor burnt the grange , nor bussed the milking-maid ,</l>
      <l n="1433">Nor robbed the farmer of his bowl of cream :</l>
      <l n="1434">But let your Prince ( our royal word upon it ,</l>
      <l n="1435">He comes back safe ) ride with us to our lines ,</l>
      <l n="1436">And speak with Arac : Arac 's word is thrice</l>
      <l n="1437">As ours with Ida : something may be done —</l>
      <l n="1438">I know not what — and ours shall see us friends .</l>
      <l n="1439">You , likewise , our late guests , if so you will ,</l>
      <l n="1440">Follow us : who knows ? we four may build some plan</l>
      <l n="1441">Foursquare to opposition . ’</l>
      <l n="1442">Here he reached</l>
      <l n="1443">White hands of farewell to my sire , who growled</l>
      <l n="1444">An answer which , half-muffled in his beard ,</l>
      <l n="1445">Let so much out as gave us leave to go .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="69">
      <l n="1446">Then rode we with the old king across the lawns</l>
      <l n="1447">Beneath huge trees , a thousand rings of Spring</l>
      <l n="1448">In every bole , a song on every spray</l>
      <l n="1449">Of birds that piped their Valentines , and woke</l>
      <l n="1450">Desire in me to infuse my tale of love</l>
      <l n="1451">In the old king 's ears , who promised help , and oozed</l>
      <l n="1452">All o'er with honeyed answer as we rode</l>
      <l n="1453">And blossom-fragrant slipt the heavy dews</l>
      <l n="1454">Gathered by night and peace , with each light air</l>
      <l n="1455">On our mailed heads : but other thoughts than Peace</l>
      <l n="1456">Burnt in us , when we saw the embattled squares ,</l>
      <l n="1457">And squadrons of the Prince , trampling the flowers</l>
      <l n="1458">With clamour : for among them rose a cry</l>
      <l n="1459">As if to greet the king ; they made a halt ;</l>
      <l n="1460">The horses yelled ; they clashed their arms ; the drum</l>
      <l n="1461">Beat ; merrily-blowing shrilled the martial fife ;</l>
      <l n="1462">And in the blast and bray of the long horn</l>
      <l n="1463">And serpent-throated bugle , undulated</l>
      <l n="1464">The banner : anon to meet us lightly pranced</l>
      <l n="1465">Three captains out ; nor ever had I seen</l>
      <l n="1466">Such thews of men : the midmost and the highest</l>
      <l n="1467">Was Arac : all about his motion clung</l>
      <l n="1468">The shadow of his sister , as the beam</l>
      <l n="1469">Of the East , that played upon them , made them glance</l>
      <l n="1470">Like those three stars of the airy Giant 's zone ,</l>
      <l n="1471">That glitter burnished by the frosty dark ;</l>
      <l n="1472">And as the fiery Sirius alters hue ,</l>
      <l n="1473">And bickers into red and emerald , shone</l>
      <l n="1474">Their morions , washed with morning , as they came .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="70">
      <l n="1475">And I that prated peace , when first I heard</l>
      <l n="1476">War-music , felt the blind wildbeast of force ,</l>
      <l n="1477">Whose home is in the sinews of a man ,</l>
      <l n="1478">Stir in me as to strike : then took the king</l>
      <l n="1479">His three broad sons ; with now a wandering hand</l>
      <l n="1480">And now a pointed finger , told them all :</l>
      <l n="1481">A common light of smiles at our disguise</l>

    <head>CONCLUSION</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">So closed our tale , of which I give you all</l>
     <l n="2">The random scheme as wildly as it rose :</l>
     <l n="3">The words are mostly mine ; for when we ceased</l>
     <l n="4">There came a minute 's pause , and Walter said ,</l>
     <l n="5">‘ I wish she had not yielded ! ’ then to me ,</l>
     <l n="6">‘ What , if you drest it up poetically ? ’</l>
     <l n="7">So prayed the men , the women : I gave assent :</l>
     <l n="8">Yet how to bind the scattered scheme of seven</l>
     <l n="9">Together in one sheaf ? What style could suit ?</l>
     <l n="10">The men required that I should give throughout</l>
     <l n="11">The sort of mock-heroic gigantesque ,</l>
     <l n="12">With which we bantered little Lilia first :</l>
     <l n="13">The women — and perhaps they felt their power ,</l>
     <l n="14">For something in the ballads which they sang ,</l>
     <l n="15">Or in their silent influence as they sat ,</l>
     <l n="16">Had ever seemed to wrestle with burlesque ,</l>
     <l n="17">And drove us , last , to quite a solemn close —</l>
     <l n="18">They hated banter , wished for something real ,</l>
     <l n="19">A gallant fight , a noble princess — why</l>
     <l n="20">Not make her true-heroic — true-sublime ?</l>
     <l n="21">Or all , they said , as earnest as the close ?</l>
     <l n="22">Which yet with such a framework scarce could be .</l>
     <l n="23">Then rose a little feud betwixt the two ,</l>
     <l n="24">Betwixt the mockers and the realists :</l>
     <l n="25">And I , betwixt them both , to please them both ,</l>
     <l n="26">And yet to give the story as it rose ,</l>
     <l n="27">I moved as in a strange diagonal ,</l>
     <l n="28">And maybe neither pleased myself nor them .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="29">But Lilia pleased me , for she took no part</l>
     <l n="30">In our dispute : the sequel of the tale</l>
     <l n="31">Had touched her ; and she sat , she plucked the grass ,</l>
     <l n="32">She flung it from her , thinking : last , she fixt</l>
     <l n="33">A showery glance upon her aunt , and said ,</l>
     <l n="34">‘ You — tell us what we are ’ who might have told ,</l>
     <l n="35">For she was crammed with theories out of books ,</l>
     <l n="36">But that there rose a shout : the gates were closed</l>
     <l n="37">At sunset , and the crowd were swarming now ,</l>
     <l n="38">To take their leave , about the garden rails .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="39">So I and some went out to these : we climbed</l>
     <l n="40">The slope to Vivian-place , and turning saw</l>
     <l n="41">The happy valleys , half in light , and half</l>
     <l n="42">Far-shadowing from the west , a land of peace ;</l>
     <l n="43">Gray halls alone among their massive groves ;</l>
     <l n="44">Trim hamlets ; here and there a rustic tower</l>
     <l n="45">Half-lost in belts of hop and breadths of wheat ;</l>
     <l n="46">The shimmering glimpses of a stream ; the seas ;</l>
     <l n="47">A red sail , or a white ; and far beyond ,</l>
     <l n="48">Imagined more than seen , the skirts of France .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="49">‘ Look there , a garden ! ’ said my college friend ,</l>
     <l n="50">The Tory member 's elder son , ‘ and there !</l>
     <l n="51">God bless the narrow sea which keeps her off ,</l>
     <l n="52">And keeps our Britain , whole within herself ,</l>
     <l n="53">A nation yet , the rulers and the ruled —</l>
     <l n="54">Some sense of duty , something of a faith ,</l>
     <l n="55">Some reverence for the laws ourselves have made ,</l>
     <l n="56">Some patient force to change them when we will ,</l>
     <l n="57">Some civic manhood firm against the crowd —</l>
     <l n="58">But yonder , whiff ! there comes a sudden heat ,</l>
     <l n="59">The gravest citizen seems to lose his head ,</l>
     <l n="60">The king is scared , the soldier will not fight ,</l>
     <l n="61">The little boys begin to shoot and stab ,</l>
     <l n="62">A kingdom topples over with a shriek</l>
     <l n="63">Like an old woman , and down rolls the world</l>
     <l n="64">In mock heroics stranger than our own ;</l>
     <l n="65">Revolts , republics , revolutions , most</l>
     <l n="66">No graver than a schoolboys ’ barring out ;</l>
     <l n="67">Too comic for the serious things they are ,</l>
     <l n="68">Too solemn for the comic touches in them ,</l>
     <l n="69">Like our wild Princess with as wise a dream</l>
     <l n="70">As some of theirs — God bless the narrow seas !</l>
     <l n="71">I wish they were a whole Atlantic broad . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="72">‘ Have patience , ’ I replied , ‘ ourselves are full</l>
     <l n="73">Of social wrong ; and maybe wildest dreams</l>
     <l n="74">Are but the needful preludes of the truth :</l>
     <l n="75">For me , the genial day , the happy crowd ,</l>
     <l n="76">The sport half-science , fill me with a faith .</l>
     <l n="77">This fine old world of ours is but a child</l>
     <l n="78">Yet in the go-cart . Patience ! Give it time</l>
     <l n="79">To learn its limbs : there is a hand that guides . ’</l>

     <l n="80">In such discourse we gained the garden rails ,</l>
     <l n="81">And there we saw Sir Walter where he stood ,</l>
     <l n="82">Before a tower of crimson holly-hoaks ,</l>
     <l n="83">Among six boys , head under head , and looked</l>
     <l n="84">No little lily-handed Baronet he ,</l>
     <l n="85">A great broad-shouldered genial Englishman ,</l>
     <l n="86">A lord of fat prize-oxen and of sheep ,</l>
     <l n="87">A raiser of huge melons and of pine ,</l>
     <l n="88">A patron of some thirty charities ,</l>
     <l n="89">A pamphleteer on guano and on grain ,</l>
     <l n="90">A quarter-sessions chairman , abler none ;</l>
     <l n="91">Fair-haired and redder than a windy morn ;</l>
     <l n="92">Now shaking hands with him , now him , of those</l>
     <l n="93">That stood the nearest — now addressed to speech —</l>
     <l n="94">Who spoke few words and pithy , such as closed</l>
     <l n="95">Welcome , farewell , and welcome for the year</l>
     <l n="96">To follow : a shout rose again , and made</l>
     <l n="97">The long line of the approaching rookery swerve</l>
     <l n="98">From the elms , and shook the branches of the deer</l>
     <l n="99">From slope to slope through distant ferns , and rang</l>
     <l n="100">Beyond the bourn of sunset ; O , a shout</l>
     <l n="101">More joyful than the city-roar that hails</l>
     <l n="102">Premier or king ! Why should not these great Sirs</l>
     <l n="103">Give up their parks some dozen times a year</l>
     <l n="104">To let the people breathe ? So thrice they cried ,</l>
     <l n="105">I likewise , and in groups they streamed away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="106">But we went back to the Abbey , and sat on ,</l>
     <l n="107">So much the gathering darkness charmed : we sat</l>
     <l n="108">But spoke not , rapt in nameless reverie ,</l>
     <l n="109">Perchance upon the future man : the walls</l>
     <l n="110">Blackened about us , bats wheeled , and owls whooped ,</l>
     <l n="111">And gradually the powers of the night ,</l>
     <l n="112">That range above the region of the wind ,</l>
     <l n="113">Deepening the courts of twilight broke them up</l>
     <l n="114">Through all the silent spaces of the worlds ,</l>
     <l n="115">Beyond all thought into the Heaven of Heavens .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="116">Last little Lilia , rising quietly ,</l>
     <l n="117">Disrobed the glimmering statue of Sir Ralph</l>
     <l n="118">From those rich silks , and home well-pleased we went .</l>
