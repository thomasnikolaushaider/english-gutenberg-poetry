     <item>Preface to Notes Notes</item>
     <item>OUR generation already is overpast , And thy lov 'd legacy , Gerard , hath lain Coy in my home ; as once thy heart was fain Of shelter , when God 's terror held thee fast In life 's wild wood at Beauty and Sorrow aghast ; Thy sainted sense tramme 'd in ghostly pain , Thy rare ill-broker 'd talent in disdain : Yet love of Christ will win man 's love at last .</item>
     <item>Hell wars without ; but , dear , the while my hands Gather 'd thy book , I heard , this wintry day , Thy spirit thank me , in his young delight Stepping again upon the yellow sands . Go forth : amidst our chaffinch flock display Thy plumage of far wonder and heavenward flight !</item>
     <item>Chilswell , Jan. 1918 .</item>
     <item>( 1 ) AUTHOR 'S PREFACE</item>
     <item>THE poems in this book * (* That is , the MS. described in Editor 's preface as B . This preface does not apply to the early poems . ) are written some in Running Rhythm , the common rhythm in English use , some in Sprung Rhythm , and some in a mixture of the two . And those in the common rhythm are some counterpointed , some not .</item>
     <item>Common English rhythm , called Running Rhythm above , is measured by feet of either two or three syllables and ( putting aside the imperfect feet at the beginning and end of lines and also some unusual measures , in which feet seem to be paired together and double or composite feet to arise ) never more or less .</item>
     <item>Every foot has one principal stress or accent , and this or the syllable it falls on may be called the Stress of the foot and the other part , the one or two unaccented syllables , the Slack . Feet ( and the rhythms made out of them ) in which the stress comes first are called Falling Feet and Falling Rhythms , feet and rhythm in which the slack comes first are called Rising Feet and Rhythms , and if the stress is between two slacks there will be Rocking Feet and Rhythms . These distinctions are real and true to nature ; but for purposes of scanning it is a great convenience to follow the ( 2 ) example of music and take the stress always first , as the accent or the chief accent always comes first in a musical bar . If this is done there will be in common English verse only two possible feet — the so-called accentual Trochee and Dactyl , and correspondingly only two possible uniform rhythms , the so-called Trochaic and Dactylic . But they may be mixed and then what the Greeks called a Logaoedic Rhythm arises . These are the facts and according to these the scanning of ordinary regularly-written English verse is very simple indeed and to bring in other principles is here unnecessary .</item>
     <item>But because verse written strictly in these feet and by these principles will become same and tame the poets have brought in licences and departures from rule to give variety , and especially when the natural rhythm is rising , as in the common ten-syllable or five-foot verse , rhymed or blank . These irregularities are chiefly Reversed Feet and Reversed or Counterpoint Rhythm , which two things are two steps or degrees of licence in the same kind . By a reversed foot I mean the putting the stress where , to judge by the rest of the measure , the slack should be and the slack where the stress , and this is done freely at the beginning of a line and , in the course of a line , after a pause ; only scarcely ever in the second foot or place and never in the last , unless when the poet designs some extraordinary effect ; for these places are characteristic and sensitive and cannot well be touched . But the reversal of the first foot and of some middle ( 3 ) foot after a strong pause is a thing so natural that our poets have generally done it , from Chaucer down , without remark and it commonly passes unnoticed and cannot be said to amount to a formal change of rhythm , but rather is that irregularity which all natural growth and motion shews . If however the reversal is repeated in two feet running , especially so as to include the sensitive second foot , it must be due either to great want of ear or else is a calculated effect , the super - inducing or mounting of a new rhythm upon the old ; and since the new or mounted rhythm is actually heard and at the same time the mind naturally supplies the natural or standard foregoing rhythm , for we do not forget what the rhythm is that by rights we should be hearing , two rhythms are in some manner running at once and we have something answerable to counter - point in music , which is two or more strains of tune going on together , and this is Counterpoint Rhythm . Of this kind of verse Milton is the great master and the choruses of Samson Agonistes are written throughout in it — but with the disadvantage that he does not let the reader clearly know what the ground-rhythm is meant to be and so they have struck most readers as merely irregular . And in fact if you counterpoint throughout , since one only of the counter rhythms is actually heard , the other is really destroyed or cannot come to exist , and what is written is one rhythm only and probably Sprung Rhythm , of which I now speak .</item>
     <item>Sprung Rhythm , as used in this book , is measured by feet of from one to four syllables , regularly , and for ( 4 ) particular effects any number of weak or slack syllables may be used . It has one stress , which falls on the only syllable , if there is only one , or , if there are more , then scanning as above , on the first , and so gives rise to four sorts of feet , a monosyllable and the so-called accentual Trochee , Dactyl , and the First Paeon . And there will be four corresponding natural rhythms ; but nominally the feet are mixed and any one may follow any other . And hence Sprung Rhythm differs from Running Rhythm in having or being only one nominal rhythm , a mixed or ‘ logaoedic ’ one , instead of three , but on the other hand in having twice the flexibility of foot , so that any two stresses may either follow one another running or be divided by one , two , or three slack syllables . But strict Sprung Rhythm cannot be counterpointed . In Sprung Rhythm , as in logaoedic rhythm generally , the feet are assumed to be equally long or strong and their seeming inequality is made up by pause or stressing .</item>
     <item>Remark also that it is natural in Sprung Rhythm for the lines to be rove over , that is for the scanning of each line immediately to take up that of the one before , so that if the first has one or more syllables at its end the other must have so many the less at its beginning ; and in fact the scanning runs on without break from the beginning , say , of a stanza to the end and all the stanza is one long strain , though written in lines asunder .</item>
     <item>Two licences are natural to Sprung Rhythm . The one is rests , as in music ; but of this an example is scarcely to be found in this book , unless in the Echos , ( 5 ) second line . The other is hangers or outrides that is one , two , or three slack syllables added to a foot and not counting in the nominal scanning . They are so called because they seem to hang below the line or ride forward or backward from it in another dimension than the line itself , according to a principle needless to explain here . These outriding half feet or hangers are marked by a loop underneath them , and plenty of them will be found .</item>
     <item>The other marks are easily understood , namely accents , where the reader might be in doubt which syllable should have the stress ; slurs , that is loops over syllables , to tie them together into the time of one ; little loops at the end of a line to shew that the rhyme goes on to the first letter of the next line ; what in music are called pauses , to shew that the syllable should be dwelt on ; and twirls , to mark reversed or counterpointed rhythm .</item>
     <item>Note on the nature and history of Sprung Rhythm — Sprung Rhythm is the most natural of things . For ( 1 ) it is the rhythm of common speech and of written prose , when rhythm is perceived in them . ( 2 ) It is the rhythm of all but the most monotonously regular music , so that in the words of choruses and refrains and in songs written closely to music it arises . ( 3 ) It is found in nursery rhymes , weather saws , and so on ; because , however these may have been once made in running rhythm , the terminations having dropped off by the change of language , the stresses come together and so the rhythm is sprung . ( 4 ) It arises in common ( 6 ) verse when reversed or counterpointed , for the same reason .</item>
     <item>But nevertheless in spite of all this and though Greek and Latin lyric verse , which is well known , and the old English verse seen in Pierce Ploughman are in sprung rhythm , it has in fact ceased to be used since the Elizabethan age , Greene being the last writer who can be said to have recognised it . For perhaps there was not , down to our days , a single , even short , poem in English in which sprung rhythm is employed not for single effects or in fixed places but as the governing principle of the scansion . I say this because the contrary has been asserted : if it is otherwise the poem should be cited .</item>

   <p>Some of the sonnets in this book * (* See previous note . ) are in five-foot , some in six-foot or Alexandrine lines .</p>
   <p>Nos . 13 and 22 are Curtal-Sonnets , that is they are constructed in proportions resembling those of the sonnet proper , namely 6 + 4 instead of 8 + 6 , with however a halfline tailpiece ( so that the equation is rather 12 / 8 + 9 / 2 = 21 / 2 + 10 1 / 2 ) .</p>
