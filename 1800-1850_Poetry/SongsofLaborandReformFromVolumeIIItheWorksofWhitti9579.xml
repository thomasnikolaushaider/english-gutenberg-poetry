     <item>THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN TIME .</item>
     <item>THE Quaker of the olden time ! How calm and firm and true , Unspotted by its wrong and crime , He walked the dark earth through . The lust of power , the love of gain , The thousand lures of sin Around him , had no power to stain The purity within .</item>
     <item>With that deep insight which detects All great things in the small , And knows how each man 's life affects The spiritual life of all , He walked by faith and not by sight , By love and not by law ; The presence of the wrong or right He rather felt than saw .</item>
     <item>He felt that wrong with wrong partakes , That nothing stands alone , That whoso gives the motive , makes His brother 's sin his own . And , pausing not for doubtful choice Of evils great or small , He listened to that inward voice Which called away from all .</item>

    <docDate>O Spirit of that early day , So pure and strong and true , Be with us in the narrow way Our faithful fathers knew . Give strength the evil to forsake , The cross of Truth to bear , And love and reverent fear to make Our daily lives a prayer !<date>1838</date>. DEMOCRACY . All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you , do ye even so to them .— MATTHEW vii . 12 . BEARER of Freedom 's holy light , Breaker of Slavery 's chain and rod , The foe of all which pains the sight , Or wounds the generous ear of God ! Beautiful yet thy temples rise , Though there profaning gifts are thrown ; And fires unkindled of the skies Are glaring round thy altar-stone .</docDate>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Still sacred , though thy name be breathed By those whose hearts thy truth deride ; And garlands , plucked from thee , are wreathed Around the haughty brows of Pride . Oh , ideal of my boyhood 's time ! The faith in which my father stood , Even when the sons of Lust and Crime Had stained thy peaceful courts with blood ! Still to those courts my footsteps turn , For through the mists which darken there , I see the flame of Freedom burn ,— The Kebla of the patriot 's prayer ! The generous feeling , pure and warm , Which owns the right of all divine ; The pitying heart , the helping arm , The prompt self-sacrifice , are thine . Beneath thy broad , impartial eye , How fade the lines of caste and birth ! How equal in their suffering lie The groaning multitudes of earth ! Still to a stricken brother true , Whatever clime hath nurtured him ; As stooped to heal the wounded Jew The worshipper of Gerizim . By misery unrepelled , unawed By pomp or power , thou seest a Man In prince or peasant , slave or lord , Pale priest , or swarthy artisan . Through all disguise , form , place , or name , Beneath the flaunting robes of sin , Through poverty and squalid shame , Thou lookest on the man within . On man , as man , retaining yet , Howe'er debased , and soiled , and dim , The crown upon his forehead set , The immortal gift of God to him . And there is reverence in thy look ; For that frail form which mortals wear The Spirit of the Holiest took , And veiled His perfect brightness there . Not from the shallow babbling fount Of vain philosophy thou art ; He who of old on Syria 's Mount Thrilled , warmed , by turns , the listener 's heart , In holy words which cannot die , In thoughts which angels leaned to know , Proclaimed thy message from on high , Thy mission to a world of woe . That voice 's echo hath not died ! From the blue lake of Galilee , And Tabor 's lonely mountain-side , It calls a struggling world to thee . Thy name and watchword o'er this land I hear in every breeze that stirs , And round a thousand altars stand Thy banded party worshippers . Not , to these altars of a day , At party 's call , my gift I bring ; But on thy olden shrine I lay A freeman 's dearest offering .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>The voiceless utterance of his will ,— His pledge to Freedom and to Truth , That manhood 's heart remembers still The homage of his generous youth . Election Day ,<date>1841</date>THE GALLOWS . Written on reading pamphlets published by clergymen against the abolition of the gallows . I . THE suns of eighteen centuries have shone Since the Redeemer walked with man , and made The fisher 's boat , the cavern 's floor of stone , And mountain moss , a pillow for His head ; And He , who wandered with the peasant Jew , And broke with publicans the bread of shame , And drank with blessings , in His Father 's name , The water which Samaria 's outcast drew , Hath now His temples upon every shore , Altar and shrine and priest ; and incense dim Evermore rising , with low prayer and hymn , From lips which press the temple 's marble floor , Or kiss the gilded sign of the dread cross He bore . II . Yet as of old , when , meekly “ doing good , ” He fed a blind and selfish multitude , And even the poor companions of His lot With their dim earthly vision knew Him not , How ill are His high teachings understood Where He hath spoken Liberty , the priest At His own altar binds the chain anew ; Where He hath bidden to Life 's equal feast , The starving many wait upon the few ; Where He hath spoken Peace , His name hath been The loudest war-cry of contending men ; Priests , pale with vigils , in His name have blessed The unsheathed sword , and laid the spear in rest , Wet the war-banner with their sacred wine , And crossed its blazon with the holy sign ; Yea , in His name who bade the erring live , And daily taught His lesson , to forgive ! Twisted the cord and edged the murderous steel ; And , with His words of mercy on their lips , Hung gloating o'er the pincer 's burning grips , And the grim horror of the straining wheel ; Fed the slow flame which gnawed the victim 's limb , Who saw before his searing eyeballs swim The image of their Christ in cruel zeal , Through the black torment-smoke , held mockingly to him ! III . The blood which mingled with the desert sand , And beaded with its red and ghastly dew The vines and olives of the Holy Land ; The shrieking curses of the hunted Jew ; The white-sown bones of heretics , where'er They sank beneath the Crusade 's holy spear ; Goa 's dark dungeons , Malta 's sea-washed cell , Where with the hymns the ghostly fathers sung Mingled the groans by subtle torture wrung , Heaven 's anthem blending with the shriek of hell ! The midnight of Bartholomew , the stake Of Smithfield , and that thrice-accursed flame Which Calvin kindled by Geneva 's lake ; New<country>England</country>'s scaffold , and the priestly sneer Which mocked its victims in that hour of fear , When guilt itself a human tear might claim ,— Bear witness , O Thou wronged and merciful One ! That Earth 's most hateful crimes have in Thy name been done ! IV . Thank God ! that I have lived to see the time When the great truth begins at last to find An utterance from the deep heart of mankind , Earnest and clear , that all Revenge is Crime , That man is holier than a creed , that all Restraint upon him must consult his good , Hope 's sunshine linger on his prison wall , And Love look in upon his solitude . The beautiful lesson which our Saviour taught Through long , dark centuries its way hath wrought Into the common mind and popular thought ; And words , to which by Galilee 's lake shore The humble fishers listened with hushed oar , Have found an echo in the general heart , And of the public faith become a living part .</docImprint>
    <docDate>V. Who shall arrest this tendency ? Bring back The cells of Venice and the bigot 's rack ? Harden the softening human heart again To cold indifference to a brother 's pain ? Ye most unhappy men ! who , turned away From the mild sunshine of the Gospel day , Grope in the shadows of Man 's twilight time , What mean ye , that with ghoul-like zest ye brood , O'er those foul altars streaming with warm blood , Permitted in another age and clime ? Why cite that law with which the bigot Jew Rebuked the Pagan 's mercy , when he knew No evil in the Just One ? Wherefore turn To the dark , cruel past ? Can ye not learn From the pure Teacher 's life how mildly free Is the great Gospel of Humanity ? The Flamen 's knife is bloodless , and no more Mexitli 's altars soak with human gore , No more the ghastly sacrifices smoke Through the green arches of the Druid 's oak ; And ye of milder faith , with your high claim Of prophet-utterance in the Holiest name , Will ye become the Druids of our time Set up your scaffold-altars in our land , And , consecrators of Law 's darkest crime , Urge to its loathsome work the hangman 's hand ? Beware , lest human nature , roused at last , From its peeled shoulder your encumbrance cast , And , sick to loathing of your cry for blood , Rank ye with those who led their victims round The Celt 's red altar and the Indian 's mound , Abhorred of Earth and Heaven , a pagan brotherhood !<date>1842</date>. SEED-TIME AND HARVEST . As o'er his furrowed fields which lie Beneath a coldly dropping sky , Yet chill with winter 's melted snow , The husbandman goes forth to sow , Thus , Freedom , on the bitter blast The ventures of thy seed we cast , And trust to warmer sun and rain To swell the germs and fill the grain . Who calls thy glorious service hard ? Who deems it not its own reward ? Who , for its trials , counts it less . A cause of praise and thankfulness ? It may not be our lot to wield The sickle in the ripened field ; Nor ours to hear , on summer eves , The reaper 's song among the sheaves . Yet where our duty 's task is wrought In unison with God 's great thought , The near and future blend in one , And whatsoe'er is willed , is done ! And ours the grateful service whence Comes day by day the recompense ; The hope , the trust , the purpose stayed , The fountain and the noonday shade . And were this life the utmost span , The only end and aim of man , Better the toil of fields like these Than waking dream and slothful ease . But life , though falling like our grain , Like that revives and springs again ; And , early called , how blest are they Who wait in heaven their harvest-day !<date>1843</date>.</docDate>

    <p>TO THE REFORMERS OF ENGLAND . This poem was addressed to those who like Richard Cobden and John Bright were seeking the reform of political evils in Great Britain by peaceful and Christian means . It will be remembered that the Anti-Corn Law League was in the midst of its labors at this time . GOD bless ye , brothers ! in the fight Ye ‘ re waging now , ye cannot fail , For better is your sense of right Than king-craft 's triple mail . Than tyrant 's law , or bigot 's ban , More mighty is your simplest word ; The free heart of an honest man Than crosier or the sword . Go , let your blinded Church rehearse The lesson it has learned so well ; It moves not with its prayer or curse The gates of heaven or hell . Let the State scaffold rise again ; Did Freedom die when Russell died ? Forget ye how the blood of Vane From earth 's green bosom cried ? The great hearts of your olden time Are beating with you , full and strong ; All holy memories and sublime And glorious round ye throng . The bluff , bold men of Runnymede Are with ye still in times like these ; The shades of England 's mighty dead , Your cloud of witnesses !</p>

    <docTitle><titlePart>The truths ye urge are borne abroad By every wind and every tide ; The voice of Nature and of God Speaks out upon your side . The weapons which your hands have found Are those which Heaven itself has wrought , Light , Truth , and Love ; your battle-ground The free , broad field of Thought . No partial , selfish purpose breaks The simple beauty of your plan , Nor lie from throne or altar shakes Your steady faith in man . The languid pulse of England starts And bounds beneath your words of power , The beating of her million hearts Is with you at this hour ! O ye who , with undoubting eyes , Through present cloud and gathering storm , Behold the span of Freedom 's skies , And sunshine soft and warm ; Press bravely onward ! not in vain Your generous trust in human-kind ; The good which bloodshed could not gain Your peaceful zeal shall find . Press on ! the triumph shall be won Of common rights and equal laws , The glorious dream of Harrington , And Sidney 's good old cause . Blessing the cotter and the crown , Sweetening worn Labor 's bitter cup ; And , plucking not the highest down , Lifting the lowest up .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docDate>Press on ! and we who may not share The toil or glory of your fight May ask , at least , in earnest prayer , God 's blessing on the right !<date>1843</date>. THE HUMAN SACRIFICE .</docDate>
    <docImprint>Some leading sectarian papers had lately published the letter of a clergyman , giving an account of his attendance upon a criminal ( who had committed murder during a fit of intoxication ) , at the time of his execution , in western<settlement>New York</settlement>. The writer describes the agony of the wretched being , his abortive attempts at prayer , his appeal for life , his fear of a violent death ; and , after declaring his belief that the poor victim died without hope of salvation , concludes with a warm eulogy upon the gallows , being more than ever convinced of its utility by the awful dread and horror which it inspired .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>I . FAR from his close and noisome cell , By grassy lane and sunny stream , Blown clover field and strawberry dell , And green and meadow freshness , fell The footsteps of his dream . Again from careless feet the dew Of summer 's misty morn he shook ; Again with merry heart he threw His light line in the rippling brook . Back crowded all his school-day joys ; He urged the ball and quoit again , And heard the shout of laughing boys Come ringing down the walnut glen . Again he felt the western breeze , With scent of flowers and crisping hay ; And down again through wind-stirred trees He saw the quivering sunlight play . An angel in home 's vine-hung door , He saw his sister smile once more ; Once more the truant 's brown-locked head Upon his mother 's knees was laid , And sweetly lulled to slumber there , With evening 's holy hymn and prayer ! II . He woke . At once on heart and brain The present Terror rushed again ; Clanked on his limbs the felon 's chain He woke , to hear the church-tower tell Time 's footfall on the conscious bell , And , shuddering , feel that clanging din His life 's last hour had ushered in ; To see within his prison-yard , Through the small window , iron barred , The gallows shadow rising dim Between the sunrise heaven and him ; A horror in God 's blessed air ; A blackness in his morning light ; Like some foul devil-altar there Built up by demon hands at night . And , maddened by that evil sight , Dark , horrible , confused , and strange , A chaos of wild , weltering change , All power of check and guidance gone , Dizzy and blind , his mind swept on . In vain he strove to breathe a prayer , In vain he turned the Holy Book , He only heard the gallows-stair Creak as the wind its timbers shook . No dream for him of sin forgiven , While still that baleful spectre stood , With its hoarse murmur , “ Blood for Blood ! ” Between him and the pitying Heaven . III . Low on his dungeon floor he knelt , And smote his breast , and on his chain , Whose iron clasp he always felt , His hot tears fell like rain ; And near him , with the cold , calm look And tone of one whose formal part , Unwarmed , unsoftened of the heart , Is measured out by rule and book , With placid lip and tranquil blood , The hangman 's ghostly ally stood , Blessing with solemn text and word The gallows-drop and strangling cord ; Lending the sacred Gospel 's awe And sanction to the crime of Law . IV . He saw the victim 's tortured brow , The sweat of anguish starting there , The record of a nameless woe In the dim eye 's imploring stare , Seen hideous through the long , damp hair ,— Fingers of ghastly skin and bone Working and writhing on the stone ! And heard , by mortal terror wrung From heaving breast and stiffened tongue , The choking sob and low hoarse prayer ; As o'er his half-crazed fancy came A vision of the eternal flame , Its smoking cloud of agonies , Its demon-worm that never dies , The everlasting rise and fall Of fire-waves round the infernal wall ; While high above that dark red flood , Black , giant-like , the gallows stood ; Two busy fiends attending there One with cold mocking rite and prayer , The other with impatient grasp , Tightening the death-rope 's strangling clasp . V. The unfelt rite at length was done , The prayer unheard at length was said , An hour had passed : the noonday sun Smote on the features of the dead ! And he who stood the doomed beside , Calm gauger of the swelling tide Of mortal agony and fear , Heeding with curious eye and ear Whate'er revealed the keen excess Of man 's extremest wretchedness And who in that dark anguish saw An earnest of the victim 's fate , The vengeful terrors of God 's law , The kindlings of Eternal hate , The first drops of that fiery rain Which beats the dark red realm of pain , Did he uplift his earnest cries Against the crime of Law , which gave His brother to that fearful grave , Whereon Hope 's moonlight never lies , And Faith 's white blossoms never wave To the soft breath of Memory 's sighs ; Which sent a spirit marred and stained , By fiends of sin possessed , profaned , In madness and in blindness stark , Into the silent , unknown dark ? No , from the wild and shrinking dread , With which be saw the victim led Beneath the dark veil which divides Ever the living from the dead , And Nature 's solemn secret hides , The man of prayer can only draw New reasons for his bloody law ; New faith in staying Murder 's hand By murder at that Law 's command ; New reverence for the gallows-rope , As human nature 's latest hope ; Last relic of the good old time , When Power found license for its crime , And held a writhing world in check By that fell cord about its neck ; Stifled Sedition 's rising shout , Choked the young breath of Freedom out , And timely checked the words which sprung From Heresy 's forbidden tongue ; While in its noose of terror bound , The Church its cherished union found , Conforming , on the Moslem plan , The motley-colored mind of man , Not by the Koran and the Sword , But by the Bible and the Cord . VI . O Thou at whose rebuke the grave Back to warm life its sleeper gave , Beneath whose sad and tearful glance The cold and changed countenance Broke the still horror of its trance , And , waking , saw with joy above , A brother 's face of tenderest love ; Thou , unto whom the blind and lame , The sorrowing and the sin-sick came , And from Thy very garment 's hem Drew life and healing unto them , The burden of Thy holy faith Was love and life , not hate and death ; Man 's demon ministers of pain , The fiends of his revenge , were sent From thy pure Gospel 's element To their dark home again . Thy name is Love ! What , then , is he , Who in that name the gallows rears , An awful altar built to Thee , With sacrifice of blood and tears ? Oh , once again Thy healing lay On the blind eyes which knew Thee not , And let the light of Thy pure day Melt in upon his darkened thought . Soften his hard , cold heart , and show The power which in forbearance lies , And let him feel that mercy now Is better than old sacrifice .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docDate>VII . As on the White Sea 's charmed shore , The Parsee sees his holy hill<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>With dunnest smoke-clouds curtained o'er , Yet knows beneath them , evermore , The low , pale fire is quivering still ; So , underneath its clouds of sin , The heart of man retaineth yet Gleams of its holy origin ; And half-quenched stars that never set , Dim colors of its faded bow , And early beauty , linger there , And o'er its wasted desert blow Faint breathings of its morning air . Oh , never yet upon the scroll Of the sin-stained , but priceless soul , Hath Heaven inscribed “ Despair ! ” Cast not the clouded gem away , Quench not the dim but living ray ,— My brother man , Beware ! With that deep voice which from the skies Forbade the Patriarch 's sacrifice , God 's angel cries , Forbear<date>1843</date></docDate>
    <docTitle><titlePart>SONGS OF LABOR . DEDICATION . Prefixed to the volume of which the group of six poems following this prelude constituted the first portion . I WOULD the gift I offer here Might graces from thy favor take , And , seen through Friendship 's atmosphere , On softened lines and coloring , wear The unaccustomed light of beauty , for thy sake . Few leaves of Fancy 's spring remain But what I have I give to thee , The o'erhYpppHeNsunned bloom of summer 's plain , And paler flowers , the latter rain Calls from the westering slope of life 's autumnal lea . Above the fallen groves of green , Where youth 's enchanted forest stood , Dry root and mossed trunk between , A sober after-growth is seen , As springs the pine where falls the gay-leafed maple wood ! Yet birds will sing , and breezes play Their leaf-harps in the sombre tree ; And through the bleak and wintry day It keeps its steady green alway ,— So , even my after-thoughts may have a charm for thee . Art 's perfect forms no moral need , And beauty is its own excuse ; But for the dull and flowerless weed Some healing virtue still must plead , And the rough ore must find its honors in its use . So haply these , my simple lays Of homely toil , may serve to show The orchard bloom and tasselled maize That skirt and gladden duty 's ways , The unsung beauty hid life 's common things below . Haply from them the toiler , bent Above his forge or plough , may gain , A manlier spirit of content , And feel that life is wisest spent Where the strong working hand makes strong the working brain . The doom which to the guilty pair Without the walls of Eden came , Transforming sinless ease to care And rugged toil , no more shall bear The burden of old crime , or mark of primal shame .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docDate>A blessing now , a curse no more ; Since He , whose name we breathe with awe , The coarse mechanic vesture wore , A poor man toiling with the poor , In labor , as in prayer , fulfilling the same law .<date>1850</date>. THE SHOEMAKERS . Ho ! workers of the old time styled The Gentle Craft of Leather Young brothers of the ancient guild , Stand forth once more together ! Call out again your long array , In the olden merry manner Once more , on gay St. Crispin 's day , Fling out your blazoned banner ! Rap , rap ! upon the well-worn stone How falls the polished hammer Rap , rap I the measured sound has grown A quick and merry clamor . Now shape the sole ! now deftly curl The glossy vamp around it , And bless the while the bright-eyed girl Whose gentle fingers bound it ! For you , along the Spanish main A hundred keels are ploughing ; For you , the Indian on the plain His lasso-coil is throwing ; For you , deep glens with hemlock dark The woodman 's fire is lighting ; For you , upon the oak 's gray bark , The woodman 's axe is smiting . For you , from Carolina 's pine The rosin-gum is stealing ; For you , the dark-eyed Florentine Her silken skein is reeling ; For you , the dizzy goatherd roams His rugged Alpine ledges ; For you , round all her shepherd homes , Bloom England 's thorny hedges . The foremost still , by day or night , On moated mound or heather , Where'er the need of trampled right Brought toiling men together ; Where the free burghers from the wall Defied the mail-clad master , Than yours , at Freedom 's trumpet-call , No craftsmen rallied faster . Let foplings sneer , let fools deride , Ye heed no idle scorner ; Free hands and hearts are still your pride , And duty done , your honor . Ye dare to trust , for honest fame , The jury Time empanels , And leave to truth each noble name Which glorifies your annals . Thy songs , Hans Sachs , are living yet , In strong and hearty German ; And Bloomfield 's lay , and Gifford 's wit , And patriot fame of Sherman ; Still from his book , a mystic seer , The soul of Behmen teaches , And England 's priestcraft shakes to hear Of Fox 's leathern breeches . The foot is yours ; where'er it falls , It treads your well-wrought leather , On earthen floor , in marble halls , On carpet , or on heather . Still there the sweetest charm is found Of matron grace or vestal 's , As Hebe 's foot bore nectar round Among the old celestials .</docDate>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Rap , rap !— your stout and bluff brogan , With footsteps slow and weary , May wander where the sky 's blue span Shuts down upon the prairie . On Beauty 's foot your slippers glance , By Saratoga 's fountains , Or twinkle down the summer dance Beneath the Crystal Mountains ! The red brick to the mason 's hand , The brown earth to the tiller 's , The shoe in yours shall wealth command , Like fairy Cinderella 's ! As they who shunned the household maid Beheld the crown upon her , So all shall see your toil repaid With hearth and home and honor .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docDate>Then let the toast be freely quaffed , In water cool and brimming ,— “ All honor to the good old Craft , Its merry men and women ! ” Call out again your long array , In the old time 's pleasant manner Once more , on gay St. Crispin 's day , Fling out his blazoned banner !<date>1845</date>. THE FISHERMEN . HURRAH ! the seaward breezes Sweep down the bay amain ; Heave up , my lads , the anchor ! Run up the sail again Leave to the lubber landsmen The rail-car and the steed ; The stars of heaven shall guide us , The breath of heaven shall speed . From the hill-top looks the steeple , And the lighthouse from the sand ; And the scattered pines are waving Their farewell from the land . One glance , my lads , behind us , For the homes we leave one sigh , Ere we take the change and chances Of the ocean and the sky . Now , brothers , for the icebergs Of frozen Labrador , Floating spectral in the moonshine , Along the low , black shore ! Where like snow the gannet 's feathers On Brador 's rocks are shed , And the noisy murr are flying , Like black scuds , overhead ; Where in mist tie rock is hiding , And the sharp reef lurks below , And the white squall smites in summer , And the autumn tempests blow ; Where , through gray and rolling vapor , From evening unto morn , A thousand boats are hailing , Horn answering unto horn . Hurrah ! for the Red Island , With the white cross on its crown Hurrah ! for Meccatina , And its mountains bare and brown ! Where the Caribou 's tall antlers O'er the dwarf-wood freely toss , And the footstep of the Mickmack Has no sound upon the moss . There we 'll drop our lines , and gather Old Ocean 's treasures in , Where'er the mottled mackerel Turns up a steel-dark fin . The sea 's our field of harvest , Its scaly tribes our grain ; We 'll reap the teeming waters As at home they reap the plain . Our wet hands spread the carpet , And light the hearth of home ; From our fish , as in the old time , The silver coin shall come . As the demon fled the chamber Where the fish of Tobit lay , So ours from all our dwellings Shall frighten Want away . Though the mist upon our jackets In the bitter air congeals , And our lines wind stiff and slowly From off the frozen reels ; Though the fog be dark around us , And the storm blow high and loud , We will whistle down the wild wind , And laugh beneath the cloud ! In the darkness as in daylight , On the water as on land , God 's eye is looking on us , And beneath us is His hand ! Death will find us soon or later , On the deck or in the cot ; And we cannot meet him better Than in working out our lot . Hurrah ! hurrah ! the west-wind Comes freshening down the bay , The rising sails are filling ; Give way , my lads , give way ! Leave the coward landsman clinging To the dull earth , like a weed ; The stars of heaven shall guide us , The breath of heaven shall speed !<date>1845</date>. THE LUMBERMEN . WILDLY round our woodland quarters Sad-voiced Autumn grieves ; Thickly down these swelling waters Float his fallen leaves . Through the tall and naked timber , Column-like and old , Gleam the sunsets of November , From their skies of gold . O'er us , to the southland heading , Screams the gray wild-goose ; On the night-frost sounds the treading Of the brindled moose . Noiseless creeping , while we 're sleeping , Frost his task-work plies ; Soon , his icy bridges heaping , Shall our log-piles rise . When , with sounds of smothered thunder , On some night of rain , Lake and river break asunder Winter 's weakened chain , Down the wild March flood shall bear them To the saw-mill 's wheel , Or where Steam , the slave , shall tear them With his teeth of steel . Be it starlight , be it moonlight , In these vales below , When the earliest beams of sunlight Streak the mountain 's snow , Crisps the boar-frost , keen and early , To our hurrying feet , And the forest echoes clearly All our blows repeat . Where the crystal Ambijejis Stretches broad and clear , And Millnoket 's pine-black ridges Hide the browsing deer Where , through lakes and wide morasses , Or through rocky walls , Swift and strong , Penobscot passes White with foamy falls ; Where , through clouds , are glimpses given Of Katahdin 's sides ,— Rock and forest piled to heaven , Torn and ploughed by slides ! Far below , the Indian trapping , In the sunshine warm ; Far above , the snow-cloud wrapping Half the peak in storm ! Where are mossy carpets better Than the Persian weaves , And than Eastern perfumes sweeter Seem the fading leaves ; And a music wild and solemn , From the pine-tree 's height , Rolls its vast and sea-like volume On the wind of night ; Make we here our camp of winter ; And , through sleet and snow , Pitchy knot and beechen splinter On our hearth shall glow . Here , with mirth to lighten duty , We shall lack alone Woman 's smile and girlhood 's beauty , Childhood 's lisping tone . But their hearth is brighter burning For our toil to-day ; And the welcome of returning Shall our loss repay , When , like seamen from the waters , From the woods we come , Greeting sisters , wives , and daughters , Angels of our home ! Not for us the measured ringing From the village spire , Not for us the Sabbath singing Of the sweet-voiced choir , Ours the old , majestic temple , Where God 's brightness shines Down the dome so grand and ample , Propped by lofty pines ! Through each branch-enwoven skylight , Speaks He in the breeze , As of old beneath the twilight Of lost Eden 's trees ! For His ear , the inward feeling Needs no outward tongue ; He can see the spirit kneeling While the axe is swung . Heeding truth alone , and turning From the false and dim , Lamp of toil or altar burning Are alike to Him . Strike , then , comrades ! Trade is waiting On our rugged toil ; Far ships waiting for the freighting Of our woodland spoil . Ships , whose traffic links these highlands , Bleak and cold , of ours , With the citron-planted islands Of a clime of flowers ; To our frosts the tribute bringing Of eternal heats ; In our lap of winter flinging Tropic fruits and sweets . Cheerly , on the axe of labor , Let the sunbeams dance , Better than the flash of sabre Or the gleam of lance ! Strike ! With every blow is given Freer sun and sky , And the long-hid earth to heaven Looks , with wondering eye ! Loud behind us grow the murmurs Of the age to come ; Clang of smiths , and tread of farmers , Bearing harvest home ! Here her virgin lap with treasures Shall the green earth fill ; Waving wheat and golden maize-ears Crown each beechen hill . Keep who will the city 's alleys Take the smooth-shorn plain ’ ; Give to us the cedarn valleys , Rocks and hills of Maine ! In our North-land , wild and woody , Let us still have part Rugged nurse and mother sturdy , Hold us to thy heart ! Oh , our free hearts beat the warmer For thy breath of snow ; And our tread is all the firmer For thy rocks below . Freedom , hand in hand with labor , Walketh strong and brave ; On the forehead of his neighbor No man writeth Slave ! Lo , the day breaks ! old Katahdin 's Pine-trees show its fires , While from these dim forest gardens Rise their blackened spires . Up , my comrades ! up and doing ! Manhood 's rugged play Still renewing , bravely hewing Through the world our way !<date>1845</date>.</docDate>

      <head>THE HUSKERS .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">IT was late in mild October , and the long autumnal rain</l>
       <l n="2">Had left the summer harvest-fields all green with grass again ;</l>
       <l n="3">The first sharp frosts had fallen , leaving all the woodlands gay</l>
       <l n="4">With the hues of summer 's rainbow , or the meadow-flowers of May .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="5">Through a thin , dry mist , that morning , the sun rose broad and red ,</l>
       <l n="6">At first a rayless disk of fire , he brightened as he sped ;</l>
       <l n="7">Yet , even his noontide glory fell chastened and subdued ,</l>
       <l n="8">On the cornfields and the orchards , and softly pictured wood .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="9">And all that quiet afternoon , slow sloping to the night ,</l>
       <l n="10">He wove with golden shuttle the haze with yellow light ;</l>
       <l n="11">Slanting through the painted beeches , he glorified the hill ;</l>
       <l n="12">And , beneath it , pond and meadow lay brighter , greener still .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">And shouting boys in woodland haunts caught glimpses of that sky ,</l>
       <l n="14">Flecked by the many-tinted leaves , and laughed , they knew not why ;</l>
       <l n="15">And school-girls , gay with aster-flowers , beside the meadow brooks ,</l>
       <l n="16">Mingled the glow of autumn with the sunshine of sweet looks .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="17">From spire and barn looked westerly the patient weathercocks ;</l>
       <l n="18">But even the birches on the hill stood motionless as rocks .</l>
       <l n="19">No sound was in the woodlands , save the squirrel 's dropping shell ,</l>
       <l n="20">And the yellow leaves among the boughs , low rustling as they fell .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="21">The summer grains were harvested ; the stubble-fields lay dry ,</l>

       <l n="23">But still , on gentle hill-slopes , in valleys fringed with wood ,</l>
       <l n="24">Ungathered , bleaching in the sun , the heavy corn crop stood .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="25">Bent low , by autumn 's wind and rain , through husks that , dry and sere ,</l>
       <l n="26">Unfolded from their ripened charge , shone out the yellow ear ;</l>
       <l n="27">Beneath , the turnip lay concealed , in many a verdant fold ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="29">There wrought the busy harvesters ; and many a creaking wain</l>

       <l n="31">Till broad and red , as when he rose , the sun sank down , at last ,</l>
       <l n="32">And like a merry guest 's farewell , the day in brightness passed .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="33">And to ! as through the western pines , on meadow , stream , and pond ,</l>
       <l n="34">Flamed the red radiance of a sky , set all afire beyond ,</l>
       <l n="35">Slowly o'er the eastern sea-bluffs a milder glory shone ,</l>
       <l n="36">And the sunset and the moonrise were mingled into one !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="37">As thus into the quiet night the twilight lapsed away ,</l>

      <head>THE PRISONER FOR DEBT .</head>
      <head>Before the law authorizing imprisonment for debt had been abolished in Massachusetts , a revolutionary pensioner was confined in Charlestown jail for a debt of fourteen dollars , and on the fourth of July was seen waving a handkerchief from the bars of his cell in honor of the day .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Look on him ! through his dungeon grate ,</l>
       <l n="2">Feebly and cold , the morning light</l>
       <l n="3">Comes stealing round him , dim and late ,</l>
       <l n="4">As if it loathed the sight .</l>
       <l n="5">Reclining on his strawy bed ,</l>
       <l n="6">His hand upholds his drooping head ;</l>
       <l n="7">His bloodless cheek is seamed and hard ,</l>
       <l n="8">Unshorn his gray , neglected beard ;</l>
       <l n="9">And o'er his bony fingers flow</l>
       <l n="10">His long , dishevelled locks of snow .</l>
       <l n="11">No grateful fire before him glows ,</l>
       <l n="12">And yet the winter 's breath is chill ;</l>
       <l n="13">And o'er his half-clad person goes</l>
       <l n="14">The frequent ague thrill !</l>
       <l n="15">Silent , save ever and anon ,</l>
       <l n="16">A sound , half murmur and half groan ,</l>
       <l n="17">Forces apart the painful grip</l>
       <l n="18">Of the old sufferer 's bearded lip ;</l>
       <l n="19">Oh , sad and crushing is the fate</l>
       <l n="20">Of old age chained and desolate !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="21">Just God ! why lies that old man there ?</l>
       <l n="22">A murderer shares his prison bed ,</l>
       <l n="23">Whose eyeballs , through his horrid hair ,</l>
       <l n="24">Gleam on him , fierce and red ;</l>
       <l n="25">And the rude oath and heartless jeer</l>
       <l n="26">Fall ever on his loathing ear ,</l>
       <l n="27">And , or in wakefulness or sleep ,</l>
       <l n="28">Nerve , flesh , and pulses thrill and creep</l>
       <l n="29">Whene'er that ruffian 's tossing limb ,</l>

       <l n="31">What has the gray-haired prisoner done ?</l>
       <l n="32">Has murder stained his hands with gore ?</l>
       <l n="33">Not so ; his crime 's a fouler one ;</l>
       <l n="34">God made the old man poor !</l>
       <l n="35">For this he shares a felon 's cell ,</l>
       <l n="36">The fittest earthly type of hell</l>
       <l n="37">For this , the boon for which he poured</l>
       <l n="38">His young blood on the invader 's sword ,</l>
       <l n="39">And counted light the fearful cost ;</l>
       <l n="40">His blood-gained liberty is lost !</l>

       <l n="41">And so , for such a place of rest ,</l>

       <l n="45">Look forth , thou man of many scars ,</l>
       <l n="46">Through thy dim dungeon 's iron bars ;</l>
       <l n="47">It must be joy , in sooth , to see</l>
       <l n="48">Yon monument upreared to thee ;</l>
       <l n="49">Piled granite and a prison cell ,</l>

      <head>The writer of these lines is no enemy of Catholics . He has , on more than one occasion , exposed himself to the censures of his Protestant brethren , by his strenuous endeavors to procure indemnification for the owners of the convent destroyed near Boston . He defended the cause of the Irish patriots long before it had become popular in this country ; and he was one of the first to urge the most liberal aid to the suffering and starving population of the Catholic island . The severity of his language finds its ample apology in the reluctant confession of one of the most eminent Romish priests , the eloquent and devoted Father Ventura .</head>

     <p>THE PROBLEM .</p>
     <p>I . NOT without envy Wealth at times must look On their brown strength who wield the reaping-hook And scythe , or at the forge-fire shape the plough Or the steel harness of the steeds of steam ; All who , by skill and patience , anyhow Make service noble , and the earth redeem From savageness . By kingly accolade Than theirs was never worthier knighthood made . Well for them , if , while demagogues their vain And evil counsels proffer , they maintain Their honest manhood unseduced , and wage No war with Labor 's right to Labor 's gain Of sweet home-comfort , rest of hand and brain , And softer pillow for the head of Age .</p>
     <p>II . And well for Gain if it ungrudging yields Labor its just demand ; and well for Ease If in the uses of its own , it sees No wrong to him who tills its pleasant fields And spreads the table of its luxuries . The interests of the rich man and the poor Are one and same , inseparable evermore ; And , when scant wage or labor fail to give Food , shelter , raiment , wherewithal to live , Need has its rights , necessity its claim . Yea , even self-wrought misery and shame Test well the charity suffering long and kind . The home-pressed question of the age can find No answer in the catch-words of the blind Leaders of blind . Solution there is none Save in the Golden Rule of Christ alone . 1877 .</p>

      <head>ON THE BIG HORN .</head>
      <head>In the disastrous battle on the Big Horn River , in which General Custer and his entire force were slain , the chief Rain-in-the-Face was one of the fiercest leaders of the Indians . In Longfellow 's poem on the massacre , these lines will be remembered :—</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Revenge ! ” cried Rain-in-the-Face ,</l>
       <l n="2">“ Revenge upon all the race</l>
       <l n="3">Of the White Chief with yellow hair ! ”</l>
       <l n="4">And the mountains dark and high</l>
       <l n="5">From their crags reechoed the cry</l>
       <l n="6">Of his anger and despair .</l>

       <l n="7">He is now a man of peace ; and the agent at Standing Rock , Dakota ,</l>
       <l n="8">writes , September 28 , 1886 : “ Rain-in-the-Face is very anxious to go to</l>
       <l n="9">Hampton . I fear he is too old , but he desires very much to go . ” The</l>
       <l n="10">Southern Workman , the organ of General Armstrong 's Industrial School at</l>
       <l n="11">Hampton , Va ., says in a late number :—</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Rain-in-the-Face has applied before to come to Hampton , but his age would exclude him from the school as an ordinary student . He has shown himself very much in earnest about it , and is anxious , all say , to learn the better ways of life . It is as unusual as it is striking to see a man of his age , and one who has had such an experience , willing to give up the old way , and put himself in the position of a boy and a student . ”</p>

    <head>NOTES</head>
    <p n="1">Note 1 , page 18 . The reader may , perhaps , call to mind the beautiful sonnet of William Wordsworth , addressed to Toussaint L'Ouverture , during his confinement in France .</p>
    <p n="2">“ Toussaint !— thou most unhappy man of men Whether the whistling rustic tends his plough Within thy hearing , or thou liest now Buried in some deep dungeon 's earless den ; O miserable chieftain !— where and when Wilt thou find patience ?— Yet , die not , do thou Wear rather in thy bonds a cheerful brow ; Though fallen thyself , never to rise again , Live and take comfort . Thou hast left behind Powers that will work for thee ; air , earth , and skies ,— There 's not a breathing of the common wind That will forget thee ; thou hast great allies . Thy friends are exultations , agonies , And love , and man 's unconquerable mind . ”</p>
    <p n="3">Note 2 , page 67 . The Northern author of the Congressional rule against receiving petitions of the people on the subject of Slavery .</p>
    <p n="4">Note 3 , page 88 . There was at the time when this poem was written an Association in Liberty County , Georgia , for the religious instruction of negroes . One of their annual reports contains an address by the Rev . Josiah Spry Law , in which the following passage occurs : “ There is a growing interest in this community in the religious instruction of negroes . There is a conviction that religious instruction promotes the quiet and order of the people , and the pecuniary interest of the owners . ”</p>
    <p n="5">Note 4 , page 117 . The book-establishment of the Free-Will Baptists in Dover was refused the act of incorporation by the New Hampshire Legislature , for the reason that the newspaper organ of that sect and its leading preachers favored abolition .</p>

    <p n="7">Note 6 , page 118 . The justice before whom Elder Storrs was brought for preaching abolition on a writ drawn by Hon . M. N ., Jr ., of Pittsfield . The sheriff served the writ while the elder was praying .</p>
    <p n="8">Note 7 , page 118 . The academy at Canaan , N. H ., received one or two colored scholars , and was in consequence dragged off into a swamp by Democratic teams .</p>
    <p n="9">Note 8 , page 119 . “ Papers and memorials touching the subject of slavery shall be laid on the table without reading , debate , or reference . ” So read the gag-law , as it was called , introduced in the House by Mr. Atherton .</p>
    <p n="10">Note 9 , page 120 . The Female Anti-Slavery Society , at its first meeting in Concord , was assailed with stones and brickbats .</p>
    <p n="11">Note 10 , page 168 . The election of Charles Sumner to the United States Senate “ followed bard upon ” the rendition of the fugitive Sims by the United States officials and the armed police of Boston .</p>
    <p n="12">Note 11 , page 290 . For the idea of this line , I am indebted to Emerson , in his inimitable sonnet to the Rhodora ,—</p>
    <p n="13">“ If eyes were made for seeing , Then Beauty is its own excuse for being . ”</p>
