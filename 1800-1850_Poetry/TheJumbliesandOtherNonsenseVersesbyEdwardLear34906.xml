    <p>AUTHOR OF ‘ THE BOOK OF NONSENSE ’ WITH DRAWINGS BY L. LESLIE BROOKE FREDERICK WARNE AND CO LTD. LONDON NEW YORK INTRODUCTORY .</p>

   <titlePage>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Encouraged by the cordial reception extended by Press and Public to their issue of the “ Pelican Chorus and Other Nonsense Verses by Edward Lear , ” newly illustrated , the Publishers have requested the Artist , Mr. L. Leslie Brooke , to do a similar service for a further selection from Lear 's Nonsense Songs , thus practically completing them . In addition to “ The Jumblies , ” which has been adopted as the titular piece , this volume includes such prime favourites as “ The Owl and the Pussy Cat , ” “ The Duck and the Kangaroo , ” and “ The Dong with a Luminous Nose . ” For the benefit of those whose memories of the Nonsense Songs are not as fresh as they should be , it may be repeated that Mr. Lear did not illustrate them as fully as was his custom ; some , indeed , had no drawings at all , and others merely a headpiece . The Publishers feel , therefore , that in re-issuing the songs adequately illustrated , they are but bringing them into line with Mr. Lear 's other works . Oliver Wendell Holmes has said in a well-known poem , that —</titlePart></docTitle>
    <epigraph>
     <p>“ There is nothing that keeps its youth — So far as I know — but a tree and truth . ”</p>
    </epigraph>
    <docTitle><titlePart>He might have added certain writings ; and among those that are as fresh to-day as when they were written are the Nonsense Books of Edward Lear . Several generations of children — old as well as young — have already “ drunk delight ” from them , and it is tolerably safe to prophesy that many editions will yet be demanded . But whatever new form the changing public taste may cause them to take , they will remain as fresh to the end as they are to-day . It was one of these books that John Ruskin declared to be “ the most beneficent and innocent of all books yet produced . ” And of the author he said : “ I really do n't know any author to whom I am half so grateful for my idle self as Edward Lear . ” This is very high praise from such a source ; and in the hope that similar pleasure may be given to many new readers this new edition of the Nonsense Songs is issued .</titlePart></docTitle>

They went to sea in a Sieve , they did , In a Sieve they went to sea : In spite of all their friends could say , On a winter 's morn , on a stormy day , In a Sieve they went to sea ! And when the Sieve turned round and round , And every one cried , “ You 'll all be drowned ! ” They cried aloud , “ Our Sieve ai n't big , But we do n't care a button , we do n't care a fig ! In a Sieve we 'll go to sea ! ” Far and few , far and few , Are the lands where the Jumblies live ; Their heads are green , and their hands are blue , And they went to sea in a Sieve .</titlePart></docTitle>

      <head>THE DONG WITH A LUMINOUS NOSE .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">When awful darkness and silence reign</l>
       <l n="2">Over the great Gromboolian plain ,</l>
       <l n="3">Through the long , long wintry nights ;—</l>
       <l n="4">When the angry breakers roar ,</l>
       <l n="5">As they beat on the rocky shore ;—</l>
       <l n="6">When Storm-clouds brood on the towering heights</l>

       <l n="8">Then , through the vast and gloomy dark ,</l>

       <l n="10">A lonely spark with silvery rays</l>
       <l n="11">Piercing the coal-black night ,—</l>
       <l n="12">A meteor strange and bright :—</l>
       <l n="13">Hither and thither the vision strays ,</l>
       <l n="14">A single lurid light .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="15">Slowly it wanders ,— pauses ,— creeps ,—</l>
       <l n="16">Anon it sparkles ,— flashes and leaps ;</l>
       <l n="17">And ever as onward it gleaming goes</l>
       <l n="18">A light on the Bong-tree stems it throws .</l>
       <l n="19">And those who watch at that midnight hour</l>
       <l n="20">From Hall or Terrace , or lofty Tower ,</l>
       <l n="21">Cry , as the wild light passes along ,—</l>
       <l n="22">“ The Dong !— the Dong !</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="26">Long years ago</l>
       <l n="27">The Dong was happy and gay ,</l>
       <l n="28">Till he fell in love with a Jumbly Girl</l>
       <l n="29">Who came to those shores one day .</l>
       <l n="30">For the Jumblies came in a Sieve , they did ,—</l>
       <l n="31">Landing at eve near the Zemmery Fidd</l>
       <l n="32">Where the Oblong Oysters grow ,</l>
       <l n="33">And the rocks are smooth and gray .</l>
       <l n="34">And all the woods and the valleys rang</l>
       <l n="35">With the Chorus they daily and nightly sang ,—</l>
       <l n="36">“ Far and few , far and few ,</l>
       <l n="37">Are the lands where the Jumblies live ;</l>
       <l n="38">Their heads are green , and their hands are blue ,</l>
       <l n="39">And they went to sea in a Sieve . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="40">Happily , happily passed those days !</l>
       <l n="41">While the cheerful Jumblies staid ;</l>
       <l n="42">They danced in circlets all night long ,</l>
       <l n="43">To the plaintive pipe of the lively Dong ,</l>
       <l n="44">In moonlight , shine , or shade ,</l>
       <l n="45">For day and night he was always there</l>
       <l n="46">By the side of the Jumbly Girl so fair ,</l>
       <l n="47">With her sky-blue hands , and her sea-green hair .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="48">Till the morning came of that hateful day</l>
       <l n="49">When the Jumblies sailed in their Sieve away ,</l>
       <l n="50">And the Dong was left on the cruel shore</l>
       <l n="51">Gazing — gazing for evermore ,—</l>
       <l n="52">Ever keeping his weary eyes on</l>
       <l n="53">That pea-green sail on the far horizon ,—</l>
       <l n="54">Singing the Jumbly Chorus still</l>
       <l n="55">As he sat all day on the grassy hill ,—</l>
       <l n="56">“ Far and few , far and few ,</l>
       <l n="57">Are the lands where the Jumblies live ;</l>
       <l n="58">Their heads are green , and their hands are blue ,</l>
       <l n="59">And they went to sea in a Sieve . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="60">But when the sun was low in the West ,</l>
       <l n="61">The Dong arose and said ,—</l>
       <l n="62">“ What little sense I once possessed</l>
       <l n="63">Has quite gone out of my head ! ”</l>
       <l n="64">And since that day he wanders still</l>
       <l n="65">By lake and forest , marsh and hill ,</l>
       <l n="66">Singing — “ O somewhere , in valley or plain</l>
       <l n="67">“ Might I find my Jumbly Girl again !</l>
       <l n="68">“ For ever I 'll seek by lake and shore</l>
       <l n="69">“ Till I find my Jumbly Girl once more ! ”</l>
       <l n="70">Playing a pipe with silvery squeaks ,</l>
       <l n="71">Since then his Jumbly Girl he seeks ,</l>
       <l n="72">And because by night he could not see ,</l>
       <l n="73">He gathered the bark of the Twangum Tree</l>
       <l n="74">On the flowery plain that grows .</l>
       <l n="75">And he wove him a wondrous Nose ,—</l>
       <l n="76">A Nose as strange as a Nose could be !</l>
       <l n="77">Of vast proportions and painted red ,</l>
       <l n="78">And tied with cords to the back of his head .</l>
       <l n="79">— In a hollow rounded space it ended</l>
       <l n="80">With a luminous lamp within suspended ,</l>
       <l n="81">All fenced about</l>
       <l n="82">With a bandage stout</l>
       <l n="83">To prevent the wind from blowing it out ;—</l>
       <l n="84">And with holes all round to send the light ,</l>
       <l n="85">In gleaming rays on the dismal night .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="86">And now each night , and all night long ,</l>
       <l n="87">Over those plains still roams the Dong !</l>
       <l n="88">And above the wail of the Chimp and Snipe</l>
       <l n="89">You may hear the squeak of his plaintive pipe ,</l>
       <l n="90">While ever he seeks , but seeks in vain ,</l>
       <l n="91">To meet with his Jumbly Girl again ;</l>
       <l n="92">Lonely and wild — all night he goes ,—</l>
       <l n="93">The Dong with a luminous Nose !</l>
       <l n="94">And all who watch at the midnight hour ,</l>
       <l n="95">From Hall or Terrace , or Lofty Tower ,</l>
       <l n="96">Cry , as they trace the Meteor bright ,</l>
       <l n="97">Moving along through the dreary night ,—</l>
       <l n="98">“ This is the hour when forth he goes ,</l>
       <l n="99">“ The Dong with a luminous Nose !</l>
       <l n="100">“ Yonder — over the plain he goes ;</l>
       <l n="101">“ He goes ;</l>

       <l n="5">By way of a hat he 'd a loaf of Brown Bread ,</l>

       <l n="7">His Shirt was made up of no end of dead Mice ,</l>
       <l n="8">The warmth of whose skins was quite fluffy and nice ;—</l>

       <l n="20">Beasts , Birdles , and Boys in a tumult rushed down .</l>
       <l n="21">Two Cows and a Calf ate his Cabbage leaf Cloak ;—</l>

       <l n="27">And while they were growling , and mumbling the Chops ,</l>
       <l n="28">Ten Boys prigged the Jujubes and Chocolate Drops .</l>
