    <head>NOTE</head>
    <p n="1">[ In this story in rhyme of the fortunes of Helen , the theory that she was an unwilling victim of the Gods has been preferred . Many of the descriptions of manners are versified from the Iliad and the Odyssey . The description of the events after the death of Hector , and the account of the sack of Troy , is chiefly borrowed from Quintus Smyrnaeus . ]</p>
    <p n="2">The character and history of Helen of Troy have been conceived of in very different ways by poets and mythologists . In attempting to trace the chief current of ancient traditions about Helen , we cannot really get further back than the Homeric poems , the Iliad and Odyssey . Philological conjecture may assure us that Helen , like most of the characters of old romance , is “ merely the Dawn , ” or Light , or some other bright being carried away by Paris , who represents Night , or Winter , or the Cloud , or some other power of darkness . Without discussing these ideas , it may be said that the Greek poets ( at all events before allegorical explanations of mythology came in , about five hundred years before Christ ) regarded Helen simply as a woman of wonderful beauty . Homer was not thinking of the Dawn , or the Cloud when he described Helen among the Elders on the Ilian walls , or repeated her lament over the dead body of Hector . The Homeric poems are our oldest literary documents about Helen , but it is probable enough that the poet has modified and purified more ancient traditions which still survive in various fragments of Greek legend . In Homer Helen is always the daughter of Zeus . Isocrates tells us ( “ Helena , ” 211 b ) that “ while many of the demigods were children of Zeus , he thought the paternity of none of his daughters worth claiming , save that of Helen only . ” In Homer , then , Helen is the daughter of Zeus , but Homer says nothing of the famous legend which makes Zeus assume the form of a swan to woo the mother of Helen . Unhomeric as this myth is , we may regard it as extremely ancient . Very similar tales of pursuit and metamorphosis , for amatory or other purposes , among the old legends of Wales , and in the “ Arabian Nights , ” as well as in the myths of Australians and Red Indians . Again , the belief that different families of mankind descend from animals , as from the Swan , or from gods in the shape of animals , is found in every quarter of the world , and among the rudest races . Many Australian natives of to-day claim descent , like the royal house of Sparta , from the Swan . The Greek myths hesitated as to whether Nemesis or Leda was the bride of the Swan . Homer only mentions Leda among “ the wives and daughters of mighty men , ” whose ghosts Odysseus beheld in Hades : “ And I saw Leda , the famous bedfellow of Tyndareus , who bare to Tyndareus two sons , hardy of heart , Castor , tamer of steeds , and the boxer Polydeuces . ” These heroes Helen , in the Iliad ( iii . 238 ) , describes as her mother 's sons . Thus , if Homer has any distinct view on the subject , he holds that Leda is the mother of Helen by Zeus , of the Dioscuri by Tyndareus .</p>
    <p n="3">Greek ideas as to the character of Helen varied with the various moods of Greek literature . Homer 's own ideas about his heroine are probably best expressed in the words with which Priam greets her as she appears among the assembled elders , who are watching the Argive heroes from the wall of Troy :— “ In nowise , dear child , do I blame thee ; nay , the Gods are to blame , who have roused against me the woful war of the Achaeans . ” Homer , like Priam , throws the guilt of Helen on the Gods , but it is not very easy to understand exactly what he means by saying “ the Gods are to blame . ” In the first place , Homer avoids the psychological problems in which modern poetry revels , by attributing almost all changes of the moods of men to divine inspiration . Thus when Achilles , in a famous passage of the first book of the Iliad , puts up his half-drawn sword in the sheath , and does not slay Agamemnon , Homer assigns his repentance to the direct influence of Athene . Again , he says in the Odyssey , about Clytemnestra , that “ she would none of the foul deed ; ” that is of the love of Aegisthus , till “ the doom of the Gods bound her to her ruin . ” So far the same excuse is made for the murderous Clytemnestra as for the amiable Helen . Again , Homer is , in the strictest sense , and in strong contrast to the Greek tragedians and to Virgil , a chivalrous poet . It would probably be impossible to find a passage in which he speaks harshly or censoriously of the conduct of any fair and noble lady . The sordid treachery of Eriphyle , who sold her lord for gold , wins for her the epithet “ hateful ; ” and Achilles , in a moment of strong grief , applies a term of abhorrence to Helen . But Homer is too chivalrous to judge the life of any lady , and only shows the other side of the chivalrous character — its cruelty to persons not of noble birth — in describing the “ foul death ” of the waiting women of Penelope . “ God forbid that I should take these women 's lives by a clean death , ” says Telemachus ( Odyssey , xxii . 462 ) . So “ about all their necks nooses were cast that they might die by the death most pitiful . And they writhed with their feet for a little space , but for no long while . ” In trying to understand Homer 's estimate of Helen , therefore , we must make allowance for his theory of divine intervention , and for his chivalrous judgment of ladies . But there are two passages in the Iliad which may be taken as indicating Homer 's opinion that Helen was literally a victim , an unwilling victim , of Aphrodite , and that she was carried away by force a captive from Lacedaemon . These passages are in the Iliad , ii . 356 , 590 . In the former text Nestor says , “ let none be eager to return home ere he has couched with a Trojan 's wife , and avenged the longings and sorrows of Helen ” — [ Greek text ] . It is thus that Mr. Gladstone , a notable champion of Helen 's , would render this passage , and the same interpretation was favoured by the ancient “ Separatists ” ( Chorizontes ) , who wished to prove that the Iliad and Odyssey were by different authors ; but many authorities prefer to translate “ to avenge our labours and sorrows for Helen 's sake ” — “ to avenge all that we have endured in the attempt to win back Helen . ” Thus the evidence of this passage is ambiguous . The fairer way to seek for Homer 's real view of Helen is to examine all the passages in which she occurs . The result will be something like this :— Homer sees in Helen a being of the rarest personal charm and grace of character ; a woman who imputes to herself guilt much greater than the real measure of her offence . She is ever gentle except with the Goddess who betrayed her , and the unworthy lover whose lot she is compelled to share . Against them her helpless anger breaks out in flashes of eloquent scorn . Homer was apparently acquainted with the myth of Helen 's capture by Theseus , a myth illustrated in the decorations of the coffer of Cypselus . But we first see Helen , the cause of the war , when Menelaus and Paris are about to fight their duel for her sake , in the tenth year of the Leaguer ( Iliad , iii . 121 ) . Iris is sent to summon Helen to the walls . She finds Helen in her chamber , weaving at a mighty loom , and embroidering on tapestry the adventures of the siege — the battles of horse-taming Trojans and bronze-clad Achaeans . The message of Iris renews in Helen 's heart “ a sweet desire for her lord and her own city , and them that begat her ; ” so , draped in silvery white , Helen goes with her three maidens to the walls . There , above the gate , like some king in the Old Testament , Paris sits among his counsellors , and they are all amazed at Helen 's beauty ; “ no marvel is it that Trojans and Achaeans suffer long and weary toils for such a woman , so wondrous like to the immortal goddesses . ” Then Priam , assuring Helen that he holds her blameless , bids her name to him her kinsfolk and the other Achaean warriors . In her reply , Helen displays that grace of penitence which is certainly not often found in ancient literature :— “ Would that evil death had been my choice , when I followed thy son , and left my bridal bower and my kin , and my daughter dear , and the maidens of like age with me . ” Agamemnon she calls , “ the husband 's brother of me shameless ; alas , that such an one should be . ” She names many of the warriors , but misses her brothers Castor and Polydeuces , “ own brothers of mine , one mother bare us . Either they followed not from pleasant Lacedaemon , or hither they followed in swift ships , but now they have no heart to go down into the battle for dread of the shame and many reproaches that are mine . ”</p>
    <p n="4">“ So spake she , but already the life-giving earth did cover them , there in Lacedaemon , in their own dear country . ”</p>
    <p n="5">Menelaus and Paris fought out their duel , the Trojan was discomfited , but was rescued from death and carried to Helen 's bower by Aphrodite . Then the Goddess came in disguise to seek Helen on the wall , and force her back into the arms of her defeated lover . Helen turned on the Goddess with an abruptness and a force of sarcasm and invective which seem quite foreign to her gentle nature . “ Wilt thou take me further yet to some city of Phrygia or pleasant Maeonia , if there any man is dear to thee . . . Nay , go thyself and sit down by Paris , and forswear the paths of the Gods , but ever lament for him and cherish him , till he make thee his wife , yea , or perchance his slave , but to him will I never go . ” But this anger of Helen is soon overcome by fear , when the Goddess , in turn , waxes wrathful , and Helen is literally driven by threats — “ for the daughter of Zeus was afraid , ” — into the arms of Paris . Yet even so she taunts her lover with his cowardice , a cowardice which she never really condones . In the sixth book of the Iliad she has been urging him to return to the war . She then expresses her penitence to Hector , “ would that the fury of the wind had borne me afar to the mountains , or the wave of the roaring sea — ere ever these ill deeds were done ! ” In this passage too , she prophesies that her fortunes will be [ Greek text ] famous in the songs , good or evil , of men unborn . In the last book of the Iliad we meet Helen once more , as she laments over the dead body of Hector . “ ‘ Never , in all the twenty years since I came hither , have I heard from thee one taunt or one evil word : nay , but if any other rebuked me in the halls , any one of my husband 's brothers , or of their sisters , or their wives , or the mother of my husband ( but the king was ever gentle to me as a father ) , then wouldst thou restrain them with thy loving kindness and thy gentle speech . ’ So spake she ; weeping . ”</p>
    <p n="6">In the Odyssey , Helen is once more in Lacedaemon , the honoured but still penitent wife of Menelaus . How they became reconciled ( an extremely difficult point in the story ) , there is nothing in Homer to tell us .</p>
    <p n="7">Sir John Lubbock has conjectured that in the morals of the heroic age Helen was not really regarded as guilty . She was lawfully married , by “ capture , ” to Paris . Unfortunately for this theory there is abundant proof that , in the heroic age , wives were nominally bought for so many cattle , or given as a reward for great services . There is no sign of marriage by capture , and , again , marriage by capture is a savage institution which applies to unmarried women , not to women already wedded , as Helen was to Menelaus . Perhaps the oldest evidence we have for opinion about the later relations of Helen and Menelaus , is derived from Pausanias 's ( 174 . A. D .) description of the Chest of Cypselus . This ancient coffer , a work of the seventh century , B. C ., was still preserved at Olympia , in the time of Pausanias . On one of the bands of cedar or of ivory , was represented ( Pausanias , v. 18 ) , “ Menelaus with a sword in his hand , rushing on to kill Helen — clearly at the sacking of Ilios . ” How Menelaus passed from a desire to kill Helen to his absolute complacency in the Odyssey , Homer does not tell us . According to a statement attributed to Stesichorus ( 635 , 554 , B. C .? ) , the army of the Achaeans purposed to stone Helen , but was overawed and compelled to relent by her extraordinary beauty : “ when they beheld her , they cast down their stones on the ground . ” It may be conjectured that the reconciliation followed this futile attempt at punishing a daughter of Zeus . Homer , then , leaves us without information about the adventures of Helen , between the sack of Tiny and the reconciliation with Menelaus . He hints that she was married to Deiphobus , after the death of Paris , and alludes to the tradition that she mimicked the voices of the wives of the heroes , and so nearly tempted them to leave their ambush in the wooden horse . But in the fourth book of the Odyssey , when Telemachus visits Lacedaemon , he finds Helen the honoured wife of Menelaus , rich in the marvellous gifts bestowed on her , in her wanderings from Troy , by the princes of Egypt .</p>
    <p n="8">“ While yet he pondered these things in his mind and in his heart , Helen came forth from her fragrant vaulted chamber , like Artemis of the golden arrows ; and with her came Adraste and set for her the well-wrought chair , and Alcippe bare a rug of soft wool , and Phylo bare a silver basket which Alcandre gave her , the wife of Polybus , who dwelt in Thebes of Egypt , where is the chiefest store of wealth in the houses . He gave two silver baths to Menelaus , and tripods twain , and ten talents of gold . And besides all this , his wife bestowed on Helen lovely gifts ; a golden distaff did she give , and a silver basket with wheels beneath , and the rims thereof were finished with gold . This it was that the handmaid Phylo bare and set beside her , filled with dressed yarn , and across it was laid a distaff charged with wool of violet blue . So Helen sat her down in the chair , and beneath was a footstool for the feet . ”</p>
    <p n="9">When the host and guests begin to weep the ready tears of the heroic age over the sorrows of the past , and dread of the dim future , Helen comforts them with a magical potion .</p>
    <p n="10">“ Then Helen , daughter of Zeus , turned to new thoughts . Presently she cast a drug into the wine whereof they drank , a drug to lull all pain and anger , and bring forgetfulness of every sorrow . Whoso should drink a draught thereof , when it is mingled in the bowl , on that day he would let no tear fall down his cheeks , not though his mother and his father died , not though men slew his brother or dear son with the sword before his face , and his own eyes beheld it . Medicines of such virtue and so helpful had the daughter of Zeus , which Polydamna , the wife of Thon , had given her , a woman of Egypt , where Earth the grain-giver yields herbs in greatest plenty , many that are healing in the cup , and many baneful . ”</p>
    <p n="11">So Telemachus was kindly entertained by Helen and Menelaus , and when he left them it was not without a gift .</p>
    <p n="12">“ And Helen stood by the coffers wherein were her robes of curious needlework which she herself had wrought . Then Helen , the fair lady , lifted one and brought it out , the widest and most beautifully embroidered of all , and it shone like a star , and lay far beneath the rest . ”</p>
    <p n="13">Presently , we read , “ Helen of the fair face came up with the robe in her hands , and spake : ‘ Lo ! I too give thee this gift , dear child , a memorial of the hands of Helen , for thy bride to wear upon the day of thy desire , even of thy marriage . But meanwhile let it lie with thy mother in her chamber . And may joy go with thee to thy well-builded house , and thine own country . ’ ”</p>
    <p n="14">Helen 's last words , in Homer , are words of good omen , her prophecy to Telemachus that Odysseus shall return home after long wanderings , and take vengeance on the rovers . We see Helen no more , but Homer does not leave us in doubt as to her later fortunes . He quotes the prophecy which Proteus , the ancient one of the sea , delivered to Menelaus :—</p>
    <p n="15">“ But thou , Menelaus , son of Zeus , art not ordained to die and meet thy fate in Argos , the pasture-land of horses , but the deathless gods will convey thee to the Elysian plain and the world 's end , where is Rhadamanthus of the fair hair , where life is easiest for men . No snow is there , nor yet great storm , nor any rain ; but alway ocean sendeth forth the breeze of the shrill West to blow cool on men : yea , for thou hast Helen to wife , and thereby they deem thee to be son of Zeus . ”</p>
    <p n="16">We must believe , with Isocrates , that Helen was translated , with her lord , to that field of Elysium , “ where falls not hail , or rain , or any snow . ” This version of the end of Helen 's history we have adopted , but many other legends were known in Greece . Pausanias tells us that , in a battle between the Crotoniats and the Locrians , one Leonymus charged the empty space in the Locrian line , which was entrusted to the care of the ghost of Aias . Leonymus was wounded by the invisible spear of the hero , and could not be healed of the hurt . The Delphian oracle bade him seek the Isle of Leuke in the Euxine Sea , where Aias would appear to him , and heal him . When Leonymus returned from Leuke he told how Achilles dwelt there with his ancient comrades , and how he was now wedded to Helen of Troy . Yet the local tradition of Lacedaemon showed the sepulchre of Helen in Therapnae . According to a Rhodian legend ( adopted by the author of the “ Epic of Hades ” ) , Helen was banished from Sparta by the sons of Menelaus , came wandering to Rhodes , and was there strangled by the servants of the queen Polyxo , who thus avenged the death of her husband at Troy . It is certain , as we learn both from Herodotus ( vi . 61 ) and from Isocrates , that Helen was worshipped in Therapnae . In the days of Ariston the king , a deformed child was daily brought by her nurse to the shrine of Helen . And it is said that , as the nurse was leaving the shrine , a woman appeared unto her , and asked what she bore in her arms , who said , “ she bore a child . ” Then the woman said , “ show it to me , ” which the nurse refused , for the parents of the child had forbidden that she should be seen of any . But the woman straitly commanding that the child should be shown , and the other beholding her eagerness , at length the nurse showed the child , and the woman caressed its face and said , “ she shall be the fairest woman in Sparta . ” And from that day the fashion of its countenance was changed , “ and the child became the fairest of all the Spartan women . ”</p>
    <p n="17">It is a characteristic of Greek literature that , with the rise of democracy , the old epic conception of the ancient heroes altered . We can scarcely recognize the Odysseus of Homer in the Odysseus of Sophocles . The kings are regarded by the tragedians with some of the distrust and hatred which the unconstitutional tyrants of Athens had aroused . Just as the later chansons de geste of France , the poems written in an age of feudal opposition to central authority , degraded heroes like Charles , so rhetorical , republican , and sophistical Greece put its quibbles into the lips of Agamemnon and Helen , and slandered the stainless and fearless Patroclus and Achilles .</p>
    <p n="18">The Helen of Euripides , in the “ Troades , ” is a pettifogging sophist , who pleads her cause to Menelaus with rhetorical artifice . In the “ Helena , ” again , Euripides quite deserts the Homeric traditions , and adopts the late myths which denied that Helen ever went to Troy . She remained in Egypt , and Achaeans and Trojans fought for a mere shadow , formed by the Gods out of clouds and wind . In the “ Cyclops ” of Euripides , a satirical drama , the cynical giant is allowed to speak of Helen in a strain of coarse banter . Perhaps the essay of Isocrates on Helen may be regarded as a kind of answer to the attacks of several speakers in the works of the tragedians . Isocrates defends Helen simply on the plea of her beauty : “ To Heracles Zeus gave strength , to Helen beauty , which naturally rules over even strength itself . ” Beauty , he declares , the Gods themselves consider the noblest thing in the world , as the Goddesses showed when they contended for the prize of loveliness . And so marvellous , says Isocrates , was the beauty of Helen , that for her glory Zeus did not spare his beloved son , Sarpedon ; and Thetis saw Achilles die , and the Dawn bewailed her Memnon . “ Beauty has raised more mortals to immortality than all the other virtues together . ” And that Helen is now a Goddess , Isocrates proves by the fact that the sacrifices offered to her in Therapnae , are such as are given , not to heroes , but to immortal Gods .</p>
    <p n="19">When Rome took up the legends of Greece , she did so in no chivalrous spirit . Few poets are less chivalrous than Virgil ; no hero has less of chivalry than his pious and tearful Aeneas . In the second book of the Aeneid , the pious one finds Helen hiding in the shrine of Vesta , and determines to slay “ the common curse of Troy and of her own country . ” There is no glory , he admits , in murdering a woman :—</p>
    <p n="20">Extinxisse nefas tamen et sumpsisse merentis Laudabor poenas , animumqne explesse juvabit Ultricis flammae , et cineres satiasse meorum .</p>
    <p n="21">But Venus appears and rescues the unworthy lover of Dido from the crowning infamy which he contemplates . Hundreds of years later , Helen found a worthier poet in Quintus Smyrnaeus , who in a late age sang the swan-song of Greek epic minstrelsy . It is thus that ( in the fourth century A. D .) Quintus describes Helen , as she is led with the captive women of Ilios , to the ships of the Achaeans :— “ Now Helen lamented not , but shame dwelt in her dark eyes , and reddened her lovely cheeks , . . . while around her the people marvelled as they beheld the flawless grace and winsome beauty of the woman , and none dared upbraid her with secret taunt or open rebuke . Nay , as she had been a Goddess they beheld her gladly , for dear and desired was she in their sight . And as when their own country appeareth to men long wandering on the sea , and they , being escaped from death and the deep , gladly put forth their hands to greet their own native place ; even so all the Danaans were glad at the sight of her , and had no more memory of all their woful toil , and the din of war : such a spirit did Cytherea put into their hearts , out of favour to fair Helen and father Zeus . ” Thus Quintus makes amends for the trivial verses in which Coluthus describes the flight of a frivolous Helen with an effeminate Paris .</p>
    <p n="22">To follow the fortunes of Helen through the middle ages would demand much space and considerable research . The poets who read Dares Phrygius believed , with the scholar of Dr. Faustus , that “ Helen of Greece was the admirablest lady that ever lived . ” When English poetry first found the secret of perfect music , her sweetest numbers were offered by Marlowe at the shrine of Helen . The speech of Faustus is almost too hackneyed to be quoted , and altogether too beautiful to be omitted :—</p>
    <p n="23">Was this the face that launched a thousand ships , And burnt the topless towers of Ilium ! Sweet Helen , make me immortal with a kiss . Her lips suck forth my soul ! see where it flies ; Come , Helen , come , give me my soul again ; Here will I dwell , for heaven is in those lips , And all is dross that is not Helena .</p>
    <p n="24">Oh thou art fairer than the evening air Clad in the beauty of a thousand stars .</p>
    <p n="25">The loves of Faustus and Helen are readily allegorized into the passion of the Renaissance for classical beauty , the passion to which all that is not beauty seemed very dross . This is the idea of the second part of “ Faust , ” in which Helen once more became , as she prophesied in the Iliad , a song in the mouths of later men . Almost her latest apparition in English poetry , is in the “ Hellenics ” of Landor . The sweetness of the character of Helen ; the tragedy of the death of Corythus by the hand of his father Paris ; and the omnipotence of beauty and charm which triumph over the wrath of Menelaus , are the subjects of Landor 's verse . But Helen , as a woman , has hardly found a nobler praise , in three thousand years , than Helen , as a child , has received from Mr. Swinburne in “ Atalanta in Calydon . ” Meleager is the speaker :—</p>
    <p n="26">Even such ( for sailing hither I saw far hence , And where Eurotas hollows his moist rock Nigh Sparta , with a strenuous-hearted stream ) Even such I saw their sisters ; one swan-white , The little Helen , and less fair than she Fair Clytemnestra , grave as pasturing fawns Who feed and fear some arrow ; but at whiles , As one smitten with love or wrung with joy , She laughs and lightens with her eyes , and then Weeps ; whereat Helen , having laughed , weeps too , And the other chides her , and she being chid speaks naught , But cheeks and lips and eyelids kisses her Laughing , so fare they , as in their bloomless bud And full of unblown life , the blood of gods .</p>
    <p n="27">There is all the irony of Fate in Althaeas ’ reply</p>
    <p n="28">Sweet days befall them and good loves and lords , Tender and temperate honours of the hearths , Peace , and a perfect life and blameless bed .</p>
