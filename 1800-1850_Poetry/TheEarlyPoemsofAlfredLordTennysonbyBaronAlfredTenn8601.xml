    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">A Critical edition of Tennyson 's poems has long been an acknowledged want . He has taken his place among the English Classics , and as a Classic he is , and will be , studied , seriously and minutely , by many thousands of his countrymen , both in the present generation as well as in future ages . As in the works of his more illustrious brethren , so in his trifles will become subjects of curious interest , and assume an importance of which we have no conception now . Here he will engage the attention of the antiquary , there of the social historian . Long after his politics , his ethics , his theology have ceased to be immediately influential , they will be of immense historical significance . A consummate artist and a consummate master of our language , the process by which he achieved results so memorable can never fail to be of interest , and of absorbing interest , to critical students .</p>
    <p n="2">I must , I fear , claim the indulgence due to one who attempts , for the first time , a critical edition of a text so perplexingly voluminous in variants as Tennyson 's . I can only say that I have spared neither time nor labour to be accurate and exhaustive . I have myself collated , or have had collated for me , every edition recorded in the British Museum Catalogue , and where that has been deficient I have had recourse to other public libraries , and to the libraries of private friends . I am not conscious that I have left any variant unrecorded , but I should not like to assert that this is the case . Tennyson was so restlessly indefatigable in his corrections that there may lurk , in editions of the poems which I have not seen , other variants ; and it is also possible that , in spite of my vigilance , some may have escaped me even in the editions which have been collated , and some may have been made at a date earlier than the date recorded . But I trust this has not been the case .</p>
    <p n="3">Of the Bibliography I can say no more than that I have done my utmost to make it complete , and that it is very much fuller than any which has hitherto appeared . That it is exhaustive I dare not promise .</p>
    <p n="4">With regard to the Notes and Commentaries , I have spared no pains to explain everything which seemed to need explanation . There are , I think , only two points which I have not been able to clear up , namely , the name of the friend to whom the ‘ Palace of Art ’ was addressed , and the name of the friend to whom the ‘ Verses after Reading a Life and Letters ’ were addressed . I have consulted every one who would be likely to throw light on the subject , including the poet 's surviving sister , many of his friends , and the present Lord Tennyson , but without success ; so the names , if they were not those of some imaginary person , appear to be irrecoverable . The Prize Poem , ‘ Timbuctoo ’ , as well as the poems which were temporarily or finally suppressed in the volumes published in 1830 and 1832 have been printed in the Appendix : those which were subsequently incorporated in his Works , in large type ; those which he never reprinted , in small .</p>
    <p n="5">The text here adopted is that of 1857 , but Messrs. Macmillan , to whom I beg to express my hearty thanks , have most generously allowed me to record all the variants which are still protected by copyright . I have to thank them , too , for assistance in the Bibliography . I have also to thank Mr. J. T. Wise for his kindness in lending me the privately printed volume containing the ‘ Morte d'Arthur , Dora , ’ etc .</p>

    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="6">I</p>
    <p n="7">The development of Tennyson 's genius , methods , aims and capacity of achievement in poetry can be studied with singular precision and fulness in the history of the poems included in the present volume . In 1842 he published the two volumes which gave him , by almost general consent , the first place among the poets of his time , for , though Wordsworth was alive , Wordsworth 's best work had long been done . These two volumes contained poems which had appeared before , some in 1830 and some in 1832 , and some which were then given to the world for the first time , so that they represent work belonging to three eras in the poet 's life , poems written before he had completed his twenty-second year and belonging for the most part to his boyhood , poems written in his early manhood , and poems written between his thirty-first and thirty-fourth year .</p>
    <p n="8">The poems published in 1830 had the following title-page :</p>
    <p n="9">“ Poems , Chiefly Lyrical , by Alfred Tennyson . London : Effingham Wilson , Royal Exchange , 1830 ” .</p>
    <p n="10">They are fifty-six in number and the titles are :—</p>

   <p>Only two of these poems had been published before , namely , ‘ St. Agnes ’ , which was printed in ‘ The Keepsake ’ for 1837 , and ‘ The Sleeping Beauty ’ in ‘ The Day Dream ’ , which was adopted with some alterations from the 1830 poem , and only one of these poems was afterwards suppressed , ‘ The Skipping Rope ’ , which was , however , allowed to stand till 1851 . In 1843 appeared the second edition of these poems , which is merely a reprint with a few unimportant alterations , and which was followed in 1845 and in 1846 by a third and fourth edition equally unimportant in their variants , but in the fourth ‘ The Golden Year ’ was added . In the next edition , the fifth , 1848 , ‘ The Deserted House ’ was included from the poems of 1830 . In the sixth edition , 1850 , was included another poem , ‘ To —, after reading a Life and Letters ’ , reprinted , with some alterations , from the ‘ Examiner ’ of 24th March , 1849 .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The seventh edition , 1851 , contained important additions . First the</l>
     <l n="2">Dedication to the Queen , then ‘ Edwin Morris , ’ the fragment of ‘ The</l>
     <l n="3">Eagle , ’ and the stanzas , “ Come not when I am dead , ” first printed in</l>
     <l n="4">‘ The Keepsake ’ for 1851 , under the title of ‘ Stanzas . ’ In this edition</l>
     <l n="5">the absurd trifle ‘ The Skipping Rope ’ was excised and finally cancelled .</l>
     <l n="6">In the eighth edition , 1853 , ‘ The Sea-Fairies , ’ though greatly altered ,</l>
     <l n="7">was included from the poems of 1830 , and the poem ‘ To E. L. on his</l>
     <l n="8">Travels in Greece ’ was added . This edition , the eighth , may be regarded</l>
     <l n="9">as the final one . Nothing afterwards of much importance was added or</l>
     <l n="10">subtracted , and comparatively few alterations were made in the text from</l>
     <l n="11">that date to the last collected edition in 1898 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>All the editions up to , and including , that of 1898 have been carefully collated , so that the student of Tennyson can follow step by step the process by which he arrived at that perfection of expression which is perhaps his most striking characteristic as a poet . And it was indeed a trophy of labour , of the application “ of patient touches of unwearied art ” . Whoever will turn , say to ‘ The Palace of Art , ’ to ‘  none , ’ to the ‘ Dream of Fair Women , ’ or even to ‘ The Sea-Fairies ’ and to ‘ The Lady of Shalott , ’ will see what labour was expended on their composition . Nothing indeed can be more interesting than to note the touches , the substitution of which measured the whole distance between mediocrity and excellence . Take , for example , the magical alteration in the couplet in the ‘ Dream of Fair Women ':—</p>

   <p>What great care Tennyson took with his phraseology is curiously illustrated in ‘ The May Queen ’ . In the 1842 edition “ Robin ” was the name of the May Queen 's lover . In 1843 it was altered to “ Robert , ” and in 1845 and subsequent editions back to “ Robin ” .</p>
   <p>Compare , again , the old stanza in ‘ The Miller 's Daughter ':—</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="46">The lizard , with his shadow on the stone ,</l>
     <l n="47">Rests like a shadow , and the cicala sleeps .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>No one could have known better than Tennyson that the cicala is loudest in the torrid calm of the noonday , as Theocritus , Virgil , Byron and innumerable other poets have noticed ; at last he altered it , but at the heavy price of a cumbrous pleonasm , into “ and the winds are dead ” .</p>
   <p>He allowed many years to elapse before he corrected another error in natural history — but at last the alteration came . In ‘ The Poet 's Song ’ in the line —</p>
   <p>The swallow stopt as he hunted the bee ,</p>
   <p>the “ fly ” which the swallow does hunt was substituted for what it does not hunt , and that for very obvious reasons . But whoever would see what Tennyson 's poetry has owed to elaborate revision and scrupulous care would do well to compare the first edition of ‘ Mariana in the South ’ , ‘ The Sea-Fairies ’ , ‘ OEnone ’ , ‘ The Lady of Shalott ’ , ‘ The Palace of Art ’ and ‘ A Dream of Fair Women ’ with the poems as they are presented in 1853 . Poets do not always improve their verses by revision , as all students of Wordsworth 's text could abundantly illustrate ; but it may be doubted whether , in these poems at least , Tennyson ever made a single alteration which was not for the better . Fitzgerald , indeed , contended that in some cases , particularly in ‘ The Miller 's Daughter ’ , Tennyson would have done well to let the first reading stand , but few critics would agree with him in the instances he gives . We may perhaps regret the sacrifice of such a stanza as this —</p>
   <p>Each coltsfoot down the grassy bent , Whose round leaves hold the gathered shower , Each quaintly folded cuckoo pint , And silver-paly cuckoo flower .</p>
   <p>II</p>
   <p>Tennyson 's genius was slow in maturing . The poems contributed by him to the volume of 1827 , ‘ Poems by Two Brothers ’ , are not without some slight promise , but are very far from indicating extraordinary powers . A great advance is discernible in ‘ Timbuctoo ’ , but that Matthew Arnold should have discovered in it the germ of Tennyson 's future powers is probably to be attributed to the youth of the critic . Tennyson was in his twenty-second year when the ‘ Poems Chiefly Lyrical ’ appeared , and what strikes us in these poems is certainly not what Arthur Hallam saw in them : much rather what Coleridge and Wilson discerned in them . They are the poems of a fragile and somewhat morbid young man in whose temper we seem to see a touch of Hamlet , a touch of Romeo and , more healthily , a touch of Mercutio . Their most promising characteristic is the versatility displayed . Thus we find ‘ Mariana ’ side by side with the ‘ Supposed Confessions ’ , the ‘ Ode to Memory ’ with Greek [ ‘ oi rheontes ’ ] , ‘ The Ballad of Oriana ’ with ‘ The Dying Swan ’ , ‘ Recollections of The Arabian Nights ’ with ‘ The Poet ’ . Their worst fault is affectation . Perhaps the utmost that can be said for them is that they display a fine but somewhat thin vein of original genius , after deducing what they owe to Coleridge , to Keats and to other poets . This is seen in the magical touches of description , in the exquisite felicity of expression and rhythm which frequently mark them , in the pathos and power of such a poem as ‘ Oriana ’ , in the pathos and charm of such poems as ‘ Mariana ’ and ‘ A Dirge ’ , in the rich and almost gorgeous fancy displayed in ‘ The Recollections ’ .</p>
   <p>The poems of 1833 are much more ambitious and strike deeper notes . Here comes in for the first time that Greek [ spondaiotaes ’ ] , that high seriousness which is one of Tennyson 's chief characteristics — we see it in ‘ The Palace of Art ’ , in ‘  none ’ and in the verses ‘ To J. S . ’ But in intrinsic merit the poems were no advance on their predecessors , for the execution was not equal to the design . The best , such as ‘  none ’ , ‘ A Dream of Fair Women ’ , ‘ The Palace of Art ’ , ‘ The Lady of Shalott ’ — I am speaking of course of these poems in their first form — were full of extraordinary blemishes . The volume was degraded by pieces which were very unworthy of him , such as ‘ O Darling Room ’ and the verses ‘ To Christopher North ’ , and affectations of the worst kind deformed many , nay , perhaps the majority of the poems . But the capital defect lay in the workmanship . The diction is often languid and slipshod , sometimes quaintly affected , and we can never go far without encountering lines , stanzas , whole poems which cry aloud for the file . The power and charm of Tennyson 's poetry , even at its ripest , depend very largely , often mainly , on expression , and the couplet which he envied Browning ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The little more , and how much it is ,</l>
     <l n="2">The little less , and what worlds away ,</l>
   </lg>
   <p>is strangely applicable to his own art . On a single word , on a subtle collocation , on a slight touch depend often his finest effects : “ the little less ” reduces him to mediocrity , “ the little more ” and he is with the masters . To no poetry would the application of Goethe 's test be , as a rule , more fatal — that the real poetic quality in poetry is that which remains when it has been translated literally into prose .</p>
   <p>Whoever will compare the poems of 1832 with the same poems as they appeared in 1842 will see that the difference is not so much a difference in degree , but almost a difference in kind . In the collection of 1832 there were three gems , ‘ The Sisters ’ , the lines ‘ To J. S . ’ and ‘ The May Queen ’ . Almost all the others which are of any value were , in the edition of 1842 , carefully revised , and in some cases practically rewritten . If Tennyson 's career had closed in 1833 he would hardly have won a prominent place among the minor poets of the present century . The nine years which intervened between the publication of his second volume and the volumes of 1842 were the making of him , and transformed a mere dilettante into a master . Much has been said about the brutality of Lockhart 's review in the ‘ Quarterly ’ . In some respects it was stupid , in some respects it was unjust , but of one thing there can be no doubt — it had a most salutary effect . It held up the mirror to weaknesses and deficiencies which , if Tennyson did not care to acknowledge to others , he must certainly have acknowledged to himself . It roused him and put him on his mettle . It was a wholesome antidote to the enervating flattery of coteries and “ apostles ” who were certainly talking a great deal of nonsense about him , as Arthur Hallam 's essay in the ‘ Englishman ’ shows . During the next nine years he published nothing , with the exception of two unimportant contributions to certain minor periodicals .<span corresp="#note1" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>But he was educating himself , saturating himself with all that is best in the poetry of Ancient Greece and Rome , of modern Italy , of Germany and of his own country , studying theology , metaphysics , natural history , geology , astronomy and travels , observing nature with the eye of a poet , a painter and a naturalist . Nor was he a recluse . He threw himself heartily into the life of his time , following with the keenest interest all the great political and social movements , the progress and effects of the Reform Bill , the troubles in Ireland , the troubles with the Colonies , the struggles between the Protectionists and the Free Traders , Municipal Reform , the advance of the democracy , Chartism , the popular education question . He travelled on the Continent , he travelled in Wales and Scotland , he visited most parts of England , not as an idle tourist , but as a student with note-book in hand . And he had been submitted also to the discipline which is of all disciplines the most necessary to the poet , and without which , as Goethe says , “ he knows not the heavenly powers ": he had “ ate his bread in sorrow ” . The death of his father in 1831 had already brought him face to face , as he has himself expressed it , with the most solemn of all mysteries . In 1833 he had an awful shock in the sudden death of his friend Arthur Hallam , “ an overwhelming sorrow which blotted out all joy from his life and made him long for death ” . He had other minor troubles which contributed greatly to depress him ,— the breaking up of the old home at Somersby , his own poverty and uncertain prospects , his being compelled in consequence to break off all intercourse with Miss Emily Selwood . It is possible that ‘ Love and Duty ’ may have reference to this sorrow ; it is certain that ‘ The Two Voices ’ is autobiographical .</p>
   <p>Such was his education between 1832 and 1842 , and such the influences which were moulding him , while he was slowly evolving ‘ In Memoriam ’ and the poems first published in the latter year . To the revision of the old poems he brought tastes and instincts cultivated by the critical study of all that was best in the poetry of the world , and more particularly by a familiarity singularly intimate and affectionate with the masterpieces of the ancient classics ; he brought also the skill of a practised workman , for his diligence in production was literally that of Sir Joshua Reynolds in the sister art — ‘ nulla dies sine lineâ ’ . Into the composition of the new poems all this entered . He was no longer a trifler and a Hedonist . As Spedding has said , his former poems betrayed “ an over-indulgence in the luxuries of the senses , a profusion of splendours , harmonies , perfumes , gorgeous apparel , luscious meals and drinks , and creature comforts which rather pall upon the sense , and make the glories of the outward world to obscure a little the world within ” . Like his own ‘ Lady of Shalott ’ , he had communed too much with shadows . But the serious poet now speaks . He appeals less to the ear and the eye , and more to the heart . The sensuous is subordinated to the spiritual and the moral . He deals immediately with the dearest concerns of man and of society . He has ceased to trifle . The the [ Greek : spondaiotaes ,] the high seriousness of the true poet , occasional before , now pervades and enters essentially into his work . It is interesting to note how many of these poems have direct didactic purpose . How solemn is the message delivered in such poems as ‘ The Palace of Art ’ and ‘ The Vision of Sin ’ , how noble the teaching in ‘ Love and Duty ’ , in ‘ Oenone ’ , in ‘ Godiva ’ , in ‘ Ulysses ’ ; to how many must such a poem as ‘ The Two Voices ’ have brought solace and light ; how full of salutary lessons are the political poems ‘ You ask me , why , though ill at ease ’ and ‘ Love thou thy Land ’ , and how noble is their expression ! And , even where the poems are less directly didactic , it is such refreshment as busy life needs to converse with them , so pure , so wholesome , so graciously human is their tone , so tranquilly beautiful is their world . Who could lay down ‘ The Miller 's Daughter , Dora , The Golden Year , The Gardener 's Daughter , The Talking Oak , Audley Court , The Day Dream ’ without something of the feeling which Goethe felt when he first laid down ‘ The Vicar of Wakefield ? ’ In the best lyrics in these volumes , such as ‘ Break , Break ’ , and ‘ Move Eastward ’ , ‘ Happy Earth ’ , the most fastidious of critics must recognise flawless gems . In the two volumes of 1842 Tennyson carried to perfection all that was best in his earlier poems , and displayed powers of which he may have given some indication in his cruder efforts , but which must certainly have exceeded the expectation of the most sanguine of his rational admirers . These volumes justly gave him the first place among the poets of his time , and that supremacy he maintained — in the opinion of most — till the day of his death . It would be absurd to contend that Tennyson 's subsequent publications added nothing to the fame which will be secured to him by these poems . But this at least is certain , that , taken with ‘ In Memorium ’ , they represent the crown and flower of his achievement . What is best in them he never excelled and perhaps never equalled . We should be the poorer , and much the poorer , for the loss of anything which he produced subsequently , it is true ; but would we exchange half a dozen of the best of these poems or a score of the best sections of ‘ In Memoriam ’ for all that he produced between 1850 and his death ?</p>

   <p>In surveying these poems two things must strike every one — their very wide range and their very fragmentary character . There is scarcely any side of life on which they do not touch , scarcely any phase of passion and emotion to which they do not give exquisite expression . Take the love poems : compare ‘ Fatima ’ with ‘ Isabel ’ , ‘ The Miller 's Daughter ’ with ‘ Locksley Hall ’ , ‘ The Gardener 's Daughter ’ with ‘ Madeline ’ , or ‘ Mariana ’ with Cleopatra in the ‘ Dream of Fair Women ’ . When did love find purer and nobler expression than in ‘ Love and Duty ? ’ When has sorrow found utterance more perfect than in the verses ‘ To J . S ‘ ., or the passion for the past than in ‘ Break , Break , Break ’ , or revenge and jealousy than in ‘ The Sisters ? ’ In ‘ The Two Voices ’ , ‘ The Palace of Art ’ and ‘ The Vision of Sin ’ we are in another sphere . They are appeals to the soul of man on subjects of momentous concern to him . And each is a masterpiece . What is proper to philosophy and what is proper to poetry have never perhaps been so happily blended . They have all the sensuous charm of Keats , but the prose of Hume could not have presented the truths which they are designed to convey with more lucidity and precision . In that superb fragment the ‘ Morte d'Arthur ’ we have many of the noblest attributes of Epic poetry . ‘  none ’ is the perfection of the classical idyll , ‘ The Gardener 's Daughter ’ and the idylls that follow it of the romantic . ‘ Sir Galahad ’ and ‘ St. Agnes ’ are in the vein of Keats and Coleridge , but Keats and Coleridge have produced nothing more exquisite and nothing so ethereal . ‘ The Lotos * Eaters ’ is perhaps the most purely delicious poem ever written , the ‘ ne plus ultra ’ of sensuous loveliness , and yet the poet who gave us that has given us also the political poems , poems as trenchant and austerely dignified in style as they are pregnant with practical wisdom . There is the same versatility displayed in the trifles .</p>
   <p>But all is fragmentary . No thread strings these jewels . They form a collection of gems unset and unarranged . Without any system or any definite scope they have nothing of that unity in diversity which is so perceptible in the lyrics and minor poems of Goethe and Wordsworth . Capricious as the gyrations of a sea-gull seem the poet 's moods and movements . We have now the reveries of a love-sick maiden , now the picture of a soul wrestling with despair and death ; here a study from rural life , or a study in character , there a sermon on politics , or a descent into the depths of psychological truth , or a sketch from nature . But nothing could be more concentrated than the power employed to shape each fragment into form . What Pope says of the ‘ Aeneid ’ may be applied with very literal truth to these poems :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Finish 'd the whole , and laboured every part</l>
     <l n="2">With patient touches of unwearied art .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In the poems of 1842 we have the secret of Tennyson 's eminence as a poet as well as the secret of his limitations . He appears to have been constitutionally deficient in what the Greeks called ‘ architektoniké ’ , combination and disposition on a large scale . The measure of his power as a constructive artist is given us in the poem in which the English idylls may be said to culminate , namely , ‘ Enoch Arden ’ . ‘ In Memoriam ’ and the ‘ Idylls of the King ’ have a sort of spiritual unity , but they are a series of fragments tacked rather than fused together . It is the same with ‘ Maud ’ , and it is the same with ‘ The Princess ’ . His poems have always a tendency to resolve themselves into a series of cameos : it is only the short poems which have organic unity . A gift of felicitous and musical expression which is absolutely marvellous ; an instinctive sympathy with what is best and most elevated in the sphere of ordinary life , of ordinary thought and sentiment , of ordinary activity with consummate representative power ; a most rare faculty of seizing and fixing in very perfect form what is commonly so inexpressible because so impalpable and evanescent in emotion and expression ; a power of catching and rendering the charm of nature with a fidelity and vividness which resemble magic ; and lastly , unrivalled skill in choosing , repolishing and remounting the gems which are our common inheritance from the past : these are the gifts which will secure permanence for his work as long as the English language lasts .</p>
   <p>In his power of crystallising commonplaces he stands next to Pope , in subtle felicity of expression beside Virgil . And , when he says of Virgil that we find in his diction “ all the grace of all the muses often flowering in one lonely word , ” he says what is literally true of his own work . As a master of style his place is in the first rank among English classical poets . But his style is the perfection of art . His diction , like the diction of Milton and Gray , resembles mosaic work . With a touch here and a touch there , now from memory , now from unconscious assimilation , inlaying here an epithet and there a phrase , adding , subtracting , heightening , modifying , substituting one metaphor for another , developing what is latent in the suggestive imagery of a predecessor , laying under contribution the most intimate familiarity with what is best in the literature of the ancient and modern world , the unwearied artist toils patiently on till his precious mosaic work is without a flaw . All the resources of rhetoric are employed to give distinction to his style and every figure in rhetoric finds expression in his diction : Hypallage as in</p>
   <p>The pillard dusk Of sounding sycamores .</p>
   <p>— Audley Court .</p>
   <p>Paronomasia as in</p>
   <p>The seawind sang Shrill , chill with flakes of foam .</p>
   <p>— Morte d'Arthur .</p>
   <p>Oxymoron as</p>
   <p>Behold them unbeheld , unheard Hear all .</p>
   <p>— ‘  none ’ .</p>
   <p>Hyperbaton as in</p>
   <p>The dew-impearled winds of dawn .</p>
   <p>— ‘ Ode to Memory ’ .</p>
   <p>Metonymy as in</p>
   <p>The bright death quiver 'd at the victim 's throat .</p>
   <p>— ‘ Dream of Fair Women ’ .</p>
   <p>or in</p>
   <p>For some three careless moans The summer pilot of an empty heart .</p>
   <p>— ‘ Gardener 's Daughter ’ .</p>
   <p>No poet since Milton has employed what is known as Onomatopoeia with so much effect . Not to go farther than the poems of 1842 , we have in the ‘ Morte d'Arthur ':—</p>

   <p>Assonance , alliteration , the revival or adoption of obsolete and provincial words , the transplantation of phrases and idioms from the Greek and Latin languages , the employment of common words in uncommon senses , all are pressed into the service of adding distinction to his diction . His diction blends the two extremes of simplicity and artificiality , but with such fine tact that this strange combination has seldom the effect of incongruity . Longinus has remarked that “ as the fainter lustre of the stars is put out of sight by the all-encompassing rays of the sun , so when sublimity sheds its light round the sophistries of rhetoric they become invisible ” .<span corresp="#note1_2" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>What Longinus says of “ sublimity ” is equally true of sincerity and truthfulness in combination with exquisitely harmonious expression . We have an illustration in Gray 's ‘ Elegy ’ . Nothing could be more artificial than the style , but what poem in the world appeals more directly to the heart and to the eye ? It is one thing to call art to the assistance of art , it is quite another thing to call art to the assistance of nature . And this is what both Gray and Tennyson do , and this is why their artificiality , so far from shocking us , “ passes in music out of sight ” . But this cannot be said of Tennyson without reserve . At times his strained endeavours to give distinction to his style by putting common things in an uncommon way led him into intolerable affectation . Thus we have “ the knightly growth that fringed his lips ” for a moustache , “ azure pillars of the hearth ” for ascending smoke , “ ambrosial orbs ” for apples , “ frayed magnificence ” for a shabby dress , “ the secular abyss to come ” for future ages , “ the sinless years that breathed beneath the Syrian blue ” for the life of Christ , “ up went the hush 'd amaze of hand and eye ” for a gesture of surprise , and the like . One of the worst instances is in ‘ In Memoriam ’ , where what is appropriate to the simple sentiment finds , as it should do , corresponding simplicity of expression in the first couplet , to collapse into the falsetto of strained artificiality in the second :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">To rest beneath the clover sod</l>
     <l n="2">That takes the sunshine and the rains ,</l>
     <l n="3">Or where the kneeling hamlet drains</l>
     <l n="4">The chalice of the grapes of God .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>An illustration of the same thing , almost as offensive , is in ‘ Enoch Arden ’ , where , in an otherwise studiously simple diction , Enoch 's wares as a fisherman become</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">

     <l n="2">In ocean-smelling osier .</l>

     <l n="3">But these peculiarities are less common in the earlier poems than in the</l>
     <l n="4">later : it was a vicious habit which grew on him .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>But , if exception may sometimes be taken to his diction , no exception can be taken to his rhythm . No English poet since Milton , Tennyson 's only superior in this respect , had a finer ear or a more consummate mastery over all the resources of rhythmical expression . What colours are to a painter rhythm is , in description , to the poet , and few have rivalled , none have excelled Tennyson in this . Take the following :—</p>

   <p>His blank verse is best described by negatives . It has not the endless variety , the elasticity and freedom of Shakespeare 's , it has not the massiveness and majesty of Milton 's , it has not the austere grandeur of Wordsworth 's at its best , it has not the wavy swell , “ the linked sweetness long drawn out ” of Shelley 's , but its distinguishing feature is , if we may use the expression , its importunate beauty . What Coleridge said of Claudian 's style may be applied to it : “ Every line , nay every word stops , looks full in your face and asks and begs for praise ” . His earlier blank verse is less elaborate and seemingly more spontaneous and easy than his later .<span corresp="#note2" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>But it is in his lyric verse that his rhythm is seen in its greatest perfection .

   <p>But if in the world of Nature nothing escaped his sensitive and sympathetic observation ,— and indeed it might be said of him as truly as of Shelley 's ‘ Alastor ’</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Every sight</l>
     <l n="2">And sound from the vast earth and ambient air</l>
     <l n="3">Sent to his heart its choicest impulses ,</l>
   </lg>
   <p>— he had studied the world of books with not less sympathy and attention . In the sense of a profound and extensive acquaintance with all that is best in ancient and modern poetry , and in an extraordinarily wide knowledge of general literature , of philosophy and theology , of geography and travel , and of various branches of natural science , he is one of the most erudite of English poets . With the poetry of the Greek and Latin classics he was , like Milton and Gray , thoroughly saturated . Its influence penetrates his work , now in indirect reminiscence , now in direct imitation , now inspiring , now modifying , now moulding . He tells us in ‘ The Daisy ’ how when at Como “ the rich Virgilian rustic measure of ‘ Lari Maxume ’ ” haunted him all day , and in a later fragment how , as he rowed from Desenzano to Sirmio , Catullus was with him . And they and their brethren , from Homer to Theocritus , from Lucretius to Claudian , always were with him . I have illustrated so fully in the notes and elsewhere<span corresp="#note1_3" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>the influence of the Greek and Roman classics on the poems of 1842 that it is not necessary to go into detail here . But a few examples of the various ways in which they affected Tennyson 's work generally may be given . Sometimes he transfers a happy epithet or expression in literal translation , as in :—</p>
   <p>On either shining shoulder laid a hand ,</p>
   <p>which is Homer 's epithet for the shoulder —</p>
   <note>Greek : ana phaidimps omps</note>
   <p>— ‘ Od ’ ., xi ., 128 .</p>
   <p>It was the red cock shouting to the light ,</p>
   <p>exactly the</p>
   <p>[ Greek : heos eboaesen alektor ] ( Until the cock shouted ) .</p>
   <p>— ‘ Batrachomyomachia ’ , 192 .</p>
   <p>And all in passion utter 'd a ‘ dry ’ shriek ,</p>
   <p>which is the ‘ sicca vox ’ of the Roman poets . So in ‘ The Lotos Eaters ':—</p>
   <p>His voice was thin as voices from the grave ,</p>
   <p>which is Theocritus ’ voice of Hylas from his watery grave :—</p>
   <note>Greek : araia d ’ Iketo phona</note>
   <p>( Thin came the voice ) .</p>
   <p>So in ‘ The Princess ’ , sect . i .:—</p>
   <p>And cook 'd his spleen ,</p>
   <p>which is a phrase from the Greek , as in Homer , ‘ Il ’ ., iv ., 513 :—</p>
   <note>Greek : epi naeusi cholon thumalgea pessei</note>
   <p>( At the ships he cooks his heart-grieving spleen ) .</p>
   <p>Again in ‘ The Princess ’ , sect . iv . :—</p>
   <p>Laugh 'd with alien lips ,</p>
   <p>which is Homer 's ( ‘ Od ’ ., 69-70 ) —</p>
   <note>Greek : did ’ aedae gnathmoisi gelpson allotrioisi</note>
   <p>So in ‘ Edwin Morris ’ —</p>
   <p>All perfect , finished to the finger nail ,</p>
   <p>which is a phrase transferred from Latin through the Greek ; ‘ cf . ’ , Horace , ‘ Sat ’ ., i ., v ., 32 :—</p>
   <p>Ad unguem Factus homo</p>
   <p>( A man fashioned to the finger nail ) .</p>
   <p>“ The brute earth , ” ‘ In Memoriam ’ , cxxvii ., which is Horace 's</p>
   <p>Bruta tellus .</p>
   <p>— ‘ Odes ’ , i ., xxxiv ., 9 .</p>
   <p>So again :—</p>
   <p>A bevy of roses apple-cheek 'd</p>
   <p>in ‘ The Island ’ , which is Theocritus ’ [ Greek : maloparaeos ] . The line in the ‘ Morte d'Arthur ’ ,</p>
   <p>This way and that , dividing the swift mind ,</p>
   <p>is an almost literal translation of Virgil 's ‘ Aen ’ ., iv ., 285 :—</p>
   <p>Atque animum nunc huc celerem nunc dividit illuc</p>
   <p>( And this way and that he divides his swift mind ) .</p>
   <p>Another way in which they affect him is where , without direct imitation , they colour passages and poems as in ‘ Oenone ’ , ‘ The Lotos Eaters ’ , ‘ Tithonus ’ , ‘ Tiresias ’ , ‘ The Death of Oenone ’ , ‘ Demeter and Persephone ’ , the passage beginning “ From the woods ” in ‘ The Gardener 's Daughter ’ , which is a parody of Theocritus , ‘ Id . ’ , vii ., 139 ‘ seq . ’ , while the Cyclops ’ invocation to Galatea in Theocritus , ‘ Id . ’ , xi ., 29-79 , was plainly the model for the idyll , “ Come down , O Maid , ” in the seventh section of ‘ The Princess ’ , just as the tournament in the same poem recalls closely the epic of Homer and Virgil . Tennyson had a wonderful way of transfusing , as it were , the essence of some beautiful passage in a Greek or Roman poet into English . A striking illustration of this would be the influence of reminiscences of Virgil 's fourth ‘ Aeneid ’ on the idyll of ‘ Elaine and Guinevere ’ . Compare , for instance , the following : he is describing the love-wasted Elaine , as she sits brooding in the lonely evening , with the shadow of the wished-for death falling on her :—</p>

     <l n="1">But when they left her to herself again ,</l>
     <l n="2">Death , like a friend 's voice from a distant field ,</l>
     <l n="3">Approaching through the darkness , call 'd ; the owls</l>
     <l n="4">Wailing had power upon her , and she mix 'd</l>
     <l n="5">Her fancies with the sallow-rifted glooms</l>
     <l n="6">Of evening and the moanings of the wind .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>How exactly does this recall , in a manner to be felt rather than exactly defined , a passage equally exquisite and equally pathetic in Virgil 's picture of Dido , where , with the shadow of her death also falling upon her , she seems to hear the phantom voice of her dead husband , and “ mixes her fancies ” with the glooms of night and the owl 's funereal wail :—</p>

     <l n="1">Similar passages , though not so striking , would be the picture of</l>
     <l n="2">Pindar 's Elysium in ‘ Tiresias ’ , the sentiment pervading ‘ The Lotos</l>

   <p>( And the muscles on his brawny arms close under the shoulder stood out like boulders which the wintry torrent has rolled and worn smooth with the mighty eddies . )</p>
   <p>But there was another use to which Tennyson applied his accurate and intimate acquaintance with the classics . It lay in developing what was suggested by them , in unfolding , so to speak , what was furled in their imagery . Nothing is more striking in ancient classical poetry than its pregnant condensation . It often expresses in an epithet what might be expanded into a detailed picture , or calls up in a single phrase a whole scene or a whole position . Where in ‘ Merlin and Vivian ’ Tennyson described</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The blind wave feeling round his long sea hall</l>
     <l n="2">In silence ,</l>

   </lg>
   <p>It need hardly be said that these particular passages , and possibly some of the others , may be mere coincidences , but they illustrate what numberless other passages which could be cited prove that Tennyson 's careful and meditative study of the Greek and Roman poets enabled him to enrich his work by these felicitous adaptations .</p>
   <p>He used those poets as his master Virgil used his Greek predecessors , and what the elder Seneca said of Ovid , who had appropriated a line from Virgil , might exactly be applied to Tennyson : “ Fecisse quod in multis aliis versibus Virgilius fecerat , non surripiendi causâ sed palam imitandi , hoc animo ut vellet agnosci ” .<span corresp="#note4" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span></p>
   <p>He had plainly studied with equal attention the chief Italian poets , especially Dante , Petrarch , Ariosto and Tasso . On a passage in Dante he founded his ‘ Ulysses ’ , and imitations of that master are frequent throughout his poems . ‘ In Memoriam ’ , both in its general scheme as well as in numberless particular passages , closely recalls Petrarch ; and Ariosto and Tasso have each influenced his work . In the poetry of his own country nothing seems to have escaped him , either in the masters or the minor poets .<span corresp="#note5" type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>To apply the term plagiarism to Tennyson 's use of his predecessors would be as absurd as to resolve some noble fabric into its stones and bricks , and confounding the one with the other to taunt the architect with appropriating an honour which belongs to the quarry and the potter . Tennyson 's method was exactly the method of two of the greatest poets in the world , Virgil and Milton , of the poet who stands second to Virgil in Roman poetry , Horace , of one of the most illustrious of our own minor poets , Gray .</p>
   <p>An artist more fastidious than Tennyson never existed . As scrupulous a purist in language as Cicero , Chesterfield and Macaulay in prose , as Virgil , Milton , and Leopardi in verse , his care extended to the nicest minutiae of word-forms . Thus “ ancle ” is always spelt with a “ c ” when it stands alone , with a “ k ” when used in compounds ; thus he spelt “ Idylls ” with one “ l ” in the short poems , with two “ l 's ” in the epic poems ; thus the employment of “ through ” or “ thro ’ , ” of “ bad ” or “ bade , ” and the retention or suppression of “ e ” in past participles are always carefully studied . He took immense pains to avoid the clash of “ s ” with “ s , ” and to secure the predominance of open vowels when rhythm rendered them appropriate . Like the Greek painter with his partridge , he thought nothing of sacrificing good things if , in any way , they interfered with unity and symmetry , and thus , his son tells us , many stanzas , in themselves of exquisite beauty , have been lost to us .</p>

    <p>For fuller illustrations of all this , and for the influence of the ancient classics on Tennyson , I may perhaps venture to refer the reader to my ‘ Illustrations of Tennyson ’ . And may I here take the opportunity of pointing out that nothing could have been farther from my intention in that book than what has so often been most unfairly attributed to it , namely , an attempt to show that a charge of plagiarism might be justly urged against Tennyson . No honest critic , who had even cursorily inspected the book , could so utterly misrepresent its purpose .</p>

    <head>IV</head>
    <head>Tennyson 's place is not among the “ lords of the visionary eye , ” among seers , among prophets , but not the least part of the debt which his countrymen owe to him is his dedication of his art to the noblest purposes . At a time when poetry was beginning to degenerate into what it has now almost universally become — a mere sense-pampering siren , and when critics were telling us , as they are still telling us , that we are to understand by it “ all literary production which attains the power of giving pleasure by its form as distinct from its matter , ” he remained true to the creed of his great predecessors . “ L'art pour art , ” he would say , quoting Georges Sand , “ est un vain mot : l'art pour le vrai , l'art pour le beau et le bon , voila la religion que je cherche . ” When he succeeded to the laureateship he was proud to remember that the wreath which had descended to him was</head>
     <l n="1">greener from the brows</l>
     <l n="2">Of him that utter 'd nothing base ,</l>
   </lg>
   <p>and he was a loyal disciple of that poet whose aim had been , in his own words , “ to console the afflicted , to add sunshine to daylight by making the happy happier , to teach the young and the gracious of every age to see , to think , to feel , and therefore to become more actively and securely virtuous ” .<span corresp="#note1_4" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Wordsworth had said that he wished to be regarded as a teacher or as nothing , but unhappily he did not always distinguish between the way in which a poet and a philosopher should teach . He forgot that the didactic element in a poem should be , to employ a homely illustration , what garlic should be in a salad , “ scarce suspected , animate the whole , ” that the poet teaches not as the moralist and the preacher teach , but as nature and life teach us . He taught us when he wrote ‘ The Fountain ’ and ‘ The Highland Reaper , The Leach-gatherer ’ and ‘ Michael ’ , he merely wearied us when he sermonised in ‘ The Excursion ’ and in ‘ The Prelude ’ . Tennyson never makes this mistake . He is seldom directly didactic . Would he inculcate subjugation to the law of duty — he gives us the funeral ode on Wellington , ‘ The Charge of the Light Brigade ’ , and ‘ Love and Duty ’ . Would he inculcate resignation to the will of God , and the moral efficacy of conventional Christianity — he gives us ‘ Enoch Arden ’ . Would he picture the endless struggle between the sensual and the spiritual , and the relation of ideals to life — he gives us the ‘ Idylls of the King ’ . Would he point to what atheism may lead — he gives us ‘ Lucretius ’ . Poems which are masterpieces of sensuous art , such as mere aesthetes , like Rosetti and his school , must contemplate with admiring despair , he makes vehicles of the most serious moral and spiritual teaching . ‘ The Vision of Sin ’ is worth a hundred sermons on the disastrous effects of unbridled profligacy . In ‘ The Palace of Art ’ we have the quintessence of ‘ The Book of Ecclesiastes ’ and much more besides . Even in ‘ The Lotos Eaters ’ we have the mirror held up to Hedonism . On the education of the affections and on the purity of domestic life must depend very largely , not merely the happiness of individuals , but the well-being of society , and how wide a space is filled by poems in Tennyson 's works bearing influentially on these subjects is obvious . And they admit us into a pleasaunce with which it is good to be familiar , so pure and wholesome is their atmosphere , so tranquilly beautiful the world in which the characters move and the little dramas unfold themselves . They preach nothing , but deep into every heart must sink their silent lessons . “ Upon the sacredness of home life , ” writes his son , “ he would maintain that the stability and greatness of a nation largely depend ; and one of the secrets of his power over mankind was his true joy in the family duties and affections . ” What sermons have we in ‘ The Miller 's Daughter ’ , in ‘ Dora ’ , in ‘ The Gardener 's Daughter ’ and in ‘ Love and Duty ’ . ‘ The Princess ’ was a direct contribution to a social question of momentous importance to our time . ‘ Maud ’ had an immediate political purpose , while in ‘ In Memoriam ’ he became the interpreter and teacher of his generation in a still higher sense .</p>
   <p>Since Shakespeare no English poet has been so essentially patriotic , or appealed so directly to the political conscience of the nation . In his noble eulogies of the English constitution and of the virtue and wisdom of its architects , in his spirit-stirring pictures of the heroic actions of our forefathers and contemporaries both by land and sea , in his passionate denunciations of all that he believed would detract from England 's greatness and be prejudicial to her real interests , in his hearty sympathy with every movement and with every measure which he believed would contribute to her honour and her power , in all this he stands alone among modern poets . But if he loved England as Shakespeare loved her , he had other lessons than Shakespeare 's to teach her . The responsibilities imposed on the England of our time — and no poet knew this better — are very different from those imposed on the England of Elizabeth . An empire vaster and more populous than that of the Cæsars has since then been added to our dominion . Millions , indeed , who are of the same blood as ourselves and who speak our language have , by the folly of common ancestors , become aliens . But how immense are the realms peopled by the colonies which are still loyal to us , and by the three hundred millions who in India own us as their rulers : of this vast empire England is now the capital and centre . That she should fulfil completely and honourably the duties to which destiny has called her will be the prayer of every patriot , that he should by his own efforts contribute all in his power to further such fulfilment must be his earnest desire . It would be no exaggeration to say that Tennyson contributed more than any man who has ever lived to what may be called the higher political education of the English-speaking races . Of imperial federation he was at once the apostle and the pioneer . In poetry which appealed as probably no other poetry has appealed to every class , wherever our language is spoken , he dwelt fondly on all that constitutes the greatness and glory of England , on her grandeur in the past , on the magnificent promise of the part she will play in the future , if her sons are true to her . There should be no distinction , for she recognises no distinction between her children at home and her children in her colonies . She is the common mother of a common race : one flag , one sceptre , the same proud ancestry , the same splendid inheritance . “ How strange England cannot see , ” he once wrote , “ that her true policy lies in a close union with her colonies . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Sharers of our glorious past ,</l>
     <l n="2">Shall we not thro ’ good and ill</l>
     <l n="3">Cleave to one another still ?</l>
     <l n="4">Britain 's myriad voices call ,</l>
     <l n="5">Sons be welded all and all</l>
     <l n="6">Into one imperial whole ,</l>
     <l n="7">One with Britain , heart and soul !</l>
     <l n="8">One life , one flag , one fleet , one Throne !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Thus did the poetry of Tennyson draw closer , and thus will it continue to draw closer those sentimental ties — ties , in Burke 's phrase , “ light as air , but strong as links of iron , ” which bind the colonies to the mother country ; and in so doing , if he did not actually initiate , he furthered , as no other single man has furthered , the most important movement of our time . Nor has any man of genius in the present century — not Dickens , not Ruskin — been moved by a purer spirit of philanthropy , or done more to show how little the qualities and actions which dignify humanity depend , or need depend , on the accidents of fortune . He brought poetry into touch with the discoveries of science , and with the speculations of theology and metaphysics , and though , in treating such subjects , his power is not , perhaps , equal to his charm , the debt which his countrymen owe him , even intellectually , is incalculable .</p>

   <p>ISABEL</p>
   <p>First printed in 1830 .</p>
   <p>Lord Tennyson tells us ( ‘ Life of Tennyson ’ , i ., 43 ) that in this poem his father more or less described his own mother , who was a “ remarkable and saintly woman ” . In this as in the other poems elaborately painting women we may perhaps suspect the influence of Wordsworth 's ‘ Triad ’ , which should be compared with them .</p>

   <p>MARIANA</p>
   <p>“ Mariana in the moated grange . ” — ‘ Measure for Measure ’ .</p>
   <p>First printed in 1830 .</p>
   <p>This poem as we know from the motto prefixed to it was suggested by Shakespeare ( ‘ Measure for Measure ’ , iii ., 1 , “ at the moated grange resides this dejected Mariana , ” ) but the poet may have had in his mind the exquisite fragment of Sappho :—</p>
   <note>Greek : deduke men ha selanna kai Plaeïades , mesai de nuktes , para d ’ erchet h'ora ego de mona kateud'o .</note>
   <p>“ The moon has set and the Pleiades , and it is midnight : the hour too is going by , but I sleep alone . ”</p>
   <p>It was long popularly supposed that the scene of the poem was a farm near Somersby known as Baumber 's farm , but Tennyson denied this and said it was a purely “ imaginary house in the fen , ” and that he “ never so much as dreamed of Baumbers farm ” . See ‘ Life ’ , i ., 28 .</p>

   <p>With this poem should be compared the description of Harun al Rashid 's Garden of Gladness in the story of Nur-al-din Ali and the damsel Anis al Talis in the Thirty-Sixth Night . The style appears to have been modelled on Coleridge 's ‘ Kubla Khan ’ and ‘ Lewti ’ , and the influence of Coleridge is very perceptible throughout the poem .</p>

   <p>ODE TO MEMORY</p>
   <p>First printed in 1830 .</p>
   <p>After the title in 1830 ed . is “ Written very early in life ” . The influence most perceptible in this poem is plainly Coleridge , on whose ‘ Songs of the Pixies ’ it seems to have been modelled . Tennyson considered it , and no wonder , as one of the very best of “ his early and peculiarly concentrated Nature-poems ” . See ‘ Life ’ , i ., 27 . It is full of vivid and accurate pictures of his Lincolnshire home and haunts . See ‘ Life ’ , i ., 25-48 , ‘ passim ’ .</p>

   <p>First printed in 1830 .</p>
   <p>The only authoritative light thrown on the person here described is what the present Lord Tennyson gives , who tells us that “ the then well-known Cambridge orator S — was partly described ” . He was “ a very plausible , parliament-like , self-satisfied speaker at the Union Debating Society “ . The character reminds us of Wordsworth 's Moralist . See ‘ Poet 's Epitaph ’ ;—</p>

   <p>THE BALLAD OF ORIANA</p>
   <p>First published in 1830 , not in 1833 .</p>
   <p>This fine ballad was evidently suggested by the old ballad of Helen of Kirkconnel , both poems being based on a similar incident , and both being the passionate soliloquy of the bereaved lover , though Tennyson 's treatment of the subject is his own . Helen of Kirkconnel was one of the poems which he was fond of reciting , and Fitzgerald says that he used also to recite this poem , in a way not to be forgotten , at Cambridge tables . ‘ Life ’ , i ., p. 77 .</p>

    <p>THE LADY OF SHALOTT</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="15">First published in 1833 .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>This poem was composed in its first form as early as May , 1832 or 1833 , as we learn from Fitzgerald 's note — of the exact year he was not certain ( ‘ Life of Tennyson ’ , i ., 147 ) . The evolution of the poem is an interesting study . How greatly it was altered in the second edition of 1842 will be evident from the collation which follows . The text of 1842 became the permanent text , and in this no subsequent material alterations were made . The poem is more purely fanciful than Tennyson perhaps was willing to own ; certainly his explanation of the allegory , as he gave it to Canon Ainger , is not very intelligible : “ The new-born love for something , for some one in the wide world from which she has been so long excluded , takes her out of the region of shadows into that of realities ” . Poe 's commentary is most to the point : “ Why do some persons fatigue themselves in endeavours to unravel such phantasy pieces as the ‘ Lady of Shallot ’ ? As well unweave the ventum textilem ” .— ‘ Democratic Review ’ , Dec ., 1844 , quoted by Mr. Herne Shepherd . Mr. Palgrave says ( selection from the ‘ Lyric Poems of Tennyson ’ , p. 257 ) the poem was suggested by an Italian romance upon the Donna di Scalotta . On what authority this is said I do not know , nor can I identify the novel . In Novella , lxxxi ., a collection of novels printed at Milan in 1804 , there is one which tells but very briefly the story of Elaine 's love and death , “ Qui conta come la Damigella di scalot mori per amore di Lancealotto di Lac , ” and as in this novel Camelot is placed near the sea , this may be the novel referred to . In any case the poem is a fanciful and possibly an allegorical variant of the story of Elaine , Shalott being a form , through the French , of Astolat .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">First printed in 1833 .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>This poem had been written as early as 1831 ( see Arthur Hallam 's letter , ‘ Life ’ , i ., 284-5 , Appendix ) , and Lord Tennyson tells us that it “ came to my father as he was travelling between Narbonne and Perpignan ” ; how vividly the characteristic features of Southern France are depicted must be obvious to every one who is familiar with them . It is interesting to compare it with the companion poem ; the central position is the same in both , desolate loneliness , and the mood is the same , but the setting is far more picturesque and is therefore more dwelt upon . The poem was very greatly altered when re-published in 1842 , that text being practically the final one , there being no important variants afterwards .</p>
   <p>In the edition of 1833 the poem opened with the following stanza , which was afterwards excised and the stanza of the present text substituted .</p>

   <p>THE MILLER 'S DAUGHTER</p>
   <p>First published in 1833 . It was greatly altered when republished in 1842 , and in some respects , so Fitzgerald thought , not for the better . No alterations of much importance were made in it after 1842 . The characters as well as the scenery were , it seems , purely imaginary . Tennyson said that if he thought of any mill it was that of Trumpington , near Cambridge , which bears a general resemblance to the picture here given .</p>
   <p>In the first edition the poem opened with the following stanza , which the ‘ Quarterly ’ ridiculed , and which was afterwards excised . Its omission is surely not to be regretted , whatever Fitzgerald may have thought .</p>

    <head> NONE</head>
    <head>First published in 1833 , On being republished in 1842 this poem was practically rewritten , the alterations and additions so transforming the poem as to make it almost a new work . I have therefore printed a complete transcript of the edition of 1833 , which the reader can compare . The final text is , with the exception of one alteration which will be noticed , precisely that of 1842 , so there is no trouble with variants . ‘  none ’ is the first of Tennyson 's fine classical studies . The poem is modelled partly on the Alexandrian Idyll , such an Idyll for instance as the second Idyll of Theocritus or the ‘ Megara ’ or ‘ Europa ’ of Moschus , and partly perhaps on the narratives in the ‘ Metamorphoses ’ of Ovid , to which the opening bears a typical resemblance . It is possible that the poem may have been suggested by Beattie 's ‘ Judgment of Paris ’ which tells the same story , and tells it on the same lines on which it is told here , though it is not placed in the mouth of  none . Beattie 's poem opens with an elaborate description of Ida and of Troy in the distance . Paris , the husband of  none , is one afternoon confronted with the three goddesses who are , as in Tennyson 's Idyll , elaborately delineated as symbolising what they here symbolise . Each makes her speech and each offers what she has to offer , worldly dominion , wisdom , sensual pleasure . There is , of course , no comparison in point of merit between the two poems , Beattie 's being in truth perfectly commonplace . In its symbolic aspect the poem may be compared with the temptations to which Christ is submitted in ‘ Paradise Regained ’ . See books iii . and iv .</head>

   <p>The only alterations which have been made in it since have simply consisted in the alteration of “ ‘ an ’ ” for “ and ” in the third line of each stanza , and “ through and through ” for “ thro ’ and thro ’ ” in line 29 , and “ wrapt ” for “ wrapped ” in line 34 . It is curious that in 1842 the original “ bad ” was altered to “ bade , ” but all subsequent editions keep to the original . It has been said that this poem was founded on the old Scotch ballad “ The Twa Sisters ” ( see for that ballad Sharpe 's ‘ Ballad Book ’ , No . x ., p. 30 ) , but there is no resemblance at all between the ballad and this poem beyond the fact that in each there are two sisters who are both loved by a certain squire , the elder in jealousy pushing the younger into a river and drowning her .</p>

    <head>WITH THE FOLLOWING POEM</head>
    <head>I have not been able to ascertain to whom this dedication was addressed . Sir Franklin Lushington tells me that he thinks it was an imaginary person . The dedication explains the allegory intended . The poem appears to have been suggested , as we learn from ‘ Tennyson 's Life ’ ( vol . i ., p. 150 ) , by a remark of Trench to Tennyson when they were undergraduates at Trinity : “ We cannot live in art ” . It was the embodiment Tennyson added of his belief “ that the God-like life is with man and for man ” . ‘ Cf . ’ his own lines in ‘ Love and Duty ':—$</head>

    <head>THE PALACE OF ART</head>
    <head>First published in 1833 , but altered so extensively on its republication in 1842 as to be practically rewritten . The alterations in it after 1842 were not numerous , consisting chiefly in the deletion of two stanzas after line 192 and the insertion of the three stanzas which follow in the present text , together with other minor verbal corrections , all of which have been noted . No alterations were made in the text after 1853 . The allegory Tennyson explains in the dedicatory verses , but the framework of the poem was evidently suggested by ‘ Ecclesiastes ’ ii . 1-17 . The position of the hero is precisely that of Solomon . Both began by assuming that man is self-sufficing and the world sufficient ; the verdict of the one in consequence being “ vanity of vanities , all is vanity , ” of the other what the poet here records . An admirable commentary on the poem is afforded by Matthew Arnold 's picture of the Romans before Christ taught the secret of the only real happiness possible to man . See ‘ Obermann Once More ’ . The teaching of the poem has been admirably explained by Spedding . It “ represents allegorically the condition of a mind which , in the love of beauty and the triumphant consciousness of knowledge and intellectual supremacy , in the intense enjoyment of its own power and glory , has lost sight of its relation to man and God ” . See ‘ Tennyson 's Life ’ , vol . i ., p. 226 .</head>

   <p>THE LOTOS-EATERS</p>
   <p>First published in 1833 , but when republished in 1842 the alterations in the way of excision , alteration , and addition were very extensive . The text of 1842 is practically the final text . This charming poem is founded on ‘ Odyssey ’ , ix ., 82 ‘ seq . ’</p>
   <p>“ On the tenth day we set foot on the land of the lotos-eaters who eat a flowery food . So we stepped ashore and drew water ... When we had tasted meat and drink I sent forth certain of my company to go and make search what manner of men they were who here live upon the earth by bread ... Then straightway they went and mixed with the men of the lotos-eaters , and so it was that the lotos-eaters devised not death for our fellows but gave them of the lotos to taste . Now whosoever of them did eat the honey-sweet fruit of the lotos had no more wish to bring tidings nor to come back , but there he chose to abide with the lotos-eating men ever feeding on the lotos and forgetful of his homeward way . Therefore I led them back to the ships weeping and sore against their will ... lest haply any should eat of the lotos and be forgetful of returning . ”</p>
   <p>( Lang and Butcher 's translation . )</p>
   <p>But in the details of his poem Tennyson has laid many other poets under contribution , notably Moschus , ‘ Idyll ’ , v .; Bion , ‘ Idyll ’ , v .; Spenser , ‘ Faerie Queen ’ , II . vi . ( description of the ‘ Idle Lake ’ ) , and Thomson 's ‘ Castle of Indolence ’ .</p>

     <l n="6">At noontide beneath the lee ;</l>
     <l n="7">And the monstrous narwhale swalloweth</l>
     <l n="8">His foam-fountains in the sea .</l>
     <l n="9">Long enough the wine-dark wave our weary bark did carry .</l>
     <l n="10">This is lovelier and sweeter ,</l>
     <l n="11">Men of Ithaca , this is meeter ,</l>
     <l n="12">In the hollow rosy vale to tarry ,</l>
     <l n="13">Like a dreamy Lotos-eater , a delirious Lotos-eater !</l>

     <l n="22">The little isle of Ithaca , beneath the day 's decline .</l>
     <l n="23">We 'll lift no more the shattered oar ,</l>
     <l n="24">No more unfurl the straining sail ;</l>
     <l n="25">With the blissful Lotos-eaters pale</l>
     <l n="26">We will abide in the golden vale</l>
     <l n="27">Of the Lotos-land till the Lotos fail ;</l>
     <l n="28">We will not wander more .</l>
     <l n="29">Hark ! how sweet the horned ewes bleat</l>
     <l n="30">On the solitary steeps ,</l>
     <l n="31">And the merry lizard leaps ,</l>
     <l n="32">And the foam-white waters pour ;</l>
     <l n="33">And the dark pine weeps ,</l>
     <l n="34">And the lithe vine creeps ,</l>
     <l n="35">And the heavy melon sleeps</l>
     <l n="36">On the level of the shore :</l>
     <l n="37">Oh ! islanders of Ithaca , we will not wander more ,</l>
     <l n="38">Surely , surely slumber is more sweet than toil , the shore</l>
     <l n="39">Than labour in the ocean , and rowing with the oar ,</l>
     <l n="40">Oh ! islanders of Ithaca , we will return no more .</l>

   <p>The fine picture in the text of the gods of Epicurus was no doubt immediately suggested by ‘ Lucretius ’ , iii ., 15 ‘ seq . ’ , while the ‘ Icaromenippus ’ of Lucian furnishes an excellent commentary on Tennyson 's picture of those gods and what they see . ‘ Cf . ’ too the Song of the Parcae in Goethe 's ‘ Iphigenie auf Tauris ’ , iv ., 5 . ]</p>

    <head>A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN</head>
    <head>First published in 1833 but very extensively altered on its republication in 1842 . It had been written by June , 1832 , and appears to have been originally entitled ‘ Legend of Fair Women ’ ( see Spedding 's letter dated 21st June , 1832 , ‘ Life ’ , i ., 116 ) . In nearly every edition between 1833 and 1853 it was revised , and perhaps no poem proves more strikingly the scrupulous care which Tennyson took to improve what he thought susceptible of improvement . The work which inspired it , Chaucer 's ‘ Legend of Good Women ’ , was written about 1384 , thus “ preluding ” by nearly two hundred years the “ spacious times of great Elizabeth ” . There is no resemblance between the poems beyond the fact that both are visions and both have as their heroines illustrious women who have been unfortunate . Cleopatra is the only one common to the two poems . Tennyson 's is an exquisite work of art — the transition from the anarchy of dreams to the dreamland landscape and to the sharply denned figures — the skill with which the heroines ( what could be more perfect that Cleopatra and Jephtha 's daughter ? ) are chosen and contrasted — the wonderful way in which the Iphigenia of Euripides and Lucretius and the Cleopatra of Shakespeare are realised are alike admirable . The poem opened in 1833 with the following strangely irrelevant verses , excised in 1842 , which as Fitzgerald observed “ make a perfect poem by themselves without affecting the ‘ dream ‘ ":—</head>

   <note xml:id="note14_7" place="bottom" n="14">From 1833 till 1853 this stanza ran :—</note>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The tall masts quivered as they lay afloat ,</l>
     <l n="2">The temples and the people and the shore ,</l>
     <l n="3">One drew a sharp knife thro ’ my tender throat</l>
     <l n="4">Slowly ,— and nothing more ” .</l>

   <p>It is curious that Tennyson should have allowed the last line to stand so long ; possibly it may have been to defy Lockhart 's sarcastic commentary : “ What touching simplicity , what pathetic resignation — he cut my throat , nothing more ! ” With Tennyson 's picture should be compared Æschylus , ‘ Agamem . ’ , 225-49 , and Lucretius , i ., 85-100 . For the bold and picturesque substitution of the effect for the cause in the “ bright death quiver 'd ” ‘ cf . ’ Sophocles , ‘ Electra ’ , 1395 ,</p>
   <note>Greek : ‘ neakonaeton aima cheiroin echon , ’</note>
   <p>“ with the newly-whetted blood on his hands ” . So “ vulnus ” is frequently used by Virgil , and ‘ cf . ’ Silius Italicus , ‘ Punica ’ , ix ., 368-9 :—</p>

The skill with which Tennyson has here given us , in quintessence as it were , Shakespeare 's superb creation needs no commentary , but it is somewhat surprising to find an accurate scholar like Tennyson guilty of the absurdity of representing Cleopatra as of gipsy complexion . The daughter of Ptolemy Aulates and a lady of Pontus , she was of Greek descent , and had no taint at all of African intermixtures .

   <p>“ YOU ASK ME WHY , THO ’ ILL AT EASE ... ”</p>
   <p>This is another poem which , though included among those belonging to 1833 , was not published till 1842 . It is an interesting illustration , like the next poem but one , of Tennyson 's political opinions ; he was , he said , “ of the same politics as Shakespeare , Bacon and every sane man ” . He was either ignorant of the politics of Shakespeare and Bacon or did himself great injustice by the remark . It would have been more true to say — for all his works illustrate it — that he was of the same politics as Burke . He is here , and in all his poems , a Liberal-Conservative in the proper sense of the term . At the time this trio of poems was written England was passing through the throes which preceded , accompanied and followed the Reform Bill , and the lessons which Tennyson preaches in them were particularly appropriate . He belonged to the Liberal Party rather in relation to social and religious than to political questions . Thus he ardently supported the Anti-slavery Convention and advocated the measure for abolishing subscription to the Thirty-nine Articles , but he was , as a politician , on the side of Canning , Peel and the Duke of Wellington , regarding as they did the new-born democracy with mingled feelings of apprehension and perplexity . His exact attitude is indicated by some verses written about this time published by his son ( ‘ Life ’ , i ., 69-70 ) . If Mr. Aubrey de Vere is correct this and the following poem were occasioned by some popular demonstrations connected with the Reform Bill and its rejection by the House of Lords . See ‘ Life of Tennyson ’ , vol . i ., appendix .</p>

   <p>This poem , which was written at the time of the Reform Bill agitation , is a political allegory showing how illusory were the supposed advantages held out by the Radicals to the poor and labouring classes . The old woman typifies these classes , the stranger the Radicals , the goose the Radical programme , Free Trade and the like , the eggs such advantages as the proposed Radical measures might for a time seem to confer , the cluttering goose , the storm and whirlwind the heavy price which would have to be paid for them in the social anarchy resulting from triumphant Radicalism . The allegory may be narrowed to the Free Trade question .</p>

     <l n="4">The parson Holmes , the poet Everard Hall ,</l>

     <l n="9">In some odd nooks like this ; till I , tired out</l>

     <l n="11">Where , three times slipping from the outer edge ,</l>
     <l n="12">I bump 'd the ice into three several stars ,</l>
     <l n="13">Fell in a doze ; and half-awake I heard</l>
     <l n="14">The parson taking wide and wider sweeps ,</l>

     <l n="16">Now hawking at Geology and schism ;</l>
     <l n="17">Until I woke , and found him settled down</l>
     <l n="18">Upon the general decay of faith</l>
     <l n="19">Right thro ’ the world , “ at home was little left ,</l>
     <l n="20">And none abroad : there was no anchor , none ,</l>

     <l n="22">On Everard 's shoulder , with “ I hold by him ” .</l>
     <l n="23">“ And I , ” quoth Everard , “ by the wassail-bowl . ”</l>
     <l n="24">“ Why , yes , ” I said , “ we knew your gift that way</l>

     <l n="33">God knows : he has a mint of reasons : ask .</l>
     <l n="34">It pleased me well enough . ” “ Nay , nay , ” said Hall ,</l>
     <l n="35">“ Why take the style of those heroic times ?</l>
     <l n="36">For nature brings not back the Mastodon ,</l>

     <l n="45">That hears the corn-bin open , prick 'd my ears ;</l>
     <l n="46">For I remember 'd Everard 's college fame</l>
     <l n="47">When we were Freshmen : then at my request</l>
     <l n="48">He brought it ; and the poet little urged ,</l>

     <l n="50">Read , mouthing out his hollow oes and aes ,</l>

    <head>MORTE D'ARTHUR</head>
    <head>This is Tennyson 's first study from Malory 's ‘ Morte d'Arthur ’ . We learn from Fitzgerald that it was written as early as the spring of 1835 , for in that year Tennyson read it to Fitzgerald and Spedding , “ out of a MS. in a little red book , ” and again we learn that he repeated some lines of it at the end of May , 1835 , one calm day on Windermere , adding “ Not bad that , Fitz ., is it ? ” ( ‘ Life ’ , i ., 184 ) . It is here represented as the eleventh book of an Epic , the rest of which had been destroyed , though Tennyson afterwards incorporated it , adding introductory lines , with what was virtually to prove an Epic in twelve books , ‘ The Idylls of the King ’ . The substance of the poem is drawn from the third , fourth and fifth chapters of the twenty-first book of Malory 's ‘ Romance ’ , which is followed very closely . It is called “ an Homeric echo , ” but the diction bears a much closer resemblance to that of Virgil than to that of Homer , though the rhythm is perhaps more Homeric than Virgilian . It is Tennyson 's masterpiece in “ the grand style , ” and is indeed as near perfection as any work of this kind could be . In spite of its singular mixture of simplicity , purely Homeric , and artificiality , at times ultra-Virgilian , the incongruity never shocks , so noble and impressive is the general effect . The text of 1842 was never subsequently altered except in the spelling of “ mere ” and “ though ” in lines 37 , 77 , 147 , 155 , 162 , 272 , and in the insertion in 1853 of the line :—</head>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">So all day long the noise of battle roll 'd</l>
     <l n="3">Among the mountains by the winter sea ;</l>
     <l n="4">Until King Arthur 's table , man by man ,</l>
     <l n="5">Had fall'n in Lyonness about their Lord ,</l>
     <l n="6">King Arthur : then , because his wound was deep ,</l>
     <l n="7">The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him ,</l>
     <l n="8">Sir Bedivere , the last of all his knights ,</l>
     <l n="9">And bore him to a chapel nigh the field ,<span corresp="#note1_50" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></l>
     <l n="10">A broken chancel with a broken cross ,</l>
     <l n="11">That stood on a dark strait of barren land .</l>
     <l n="12">On one side lay the Ocean , and on one</l>
     <l n="13">Lay a great water , and the moon was full .</l>
     <l n="14">Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere :</l>
     <l n="15">“ The sequel of to-day unsolders all</l>
     <l n="16">The goodliest fellowship of famous knights</l>
     <l n="17">Whereof this world holds record . Such a sleep</l>
     <l n="18">They sleep — the men I loved . I think that we</l>
     <l n="19">Shall never more , at any future time ,</l>
     <l n="20">Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds ,</l>
     <l n="21">Walking about the gardens and the halls</l>

     <l n="23">I perish by this people which I made ,—</l>
     <l n="24">Tho ’ Merlin sware that I should come again</l>
     <l n="25">To rule once more — but let what will be , be ,</l>
     <l n="26">I am so deeply smitten thro ’ the helm</l>
     <l n="27">That without help I cannot last till morn .</l>
     <l n="28">Thou therefore take my brand<span corresp="#note2_42" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Excalibur ,</l>
     <l n="29">Which was my pride : for thou rememberest how</l>
     <l n="30">In those old days , one summer noon , an arm</l>
     <l n="31">Rose up from out the bosom of the lake ,</l>
     <l n="32">Clothed in white samite , mystic , wonderful ,</l>
     <l n="33">Holding the sword — and how I row 'd across</l>
     <l n="34">And took it , and have worn it , like a king :</l>
     <l n="35">And , wheresoever I am sung or told</l>
     <l n="36">In aftertime , this also shall be known :</l>
     <l n="37">But now delay not : take Excalibur ,</l>
     <l n="38">And fling him far into the middle mere :</l>
     <l n="39">Watch what thou seëst , and lightly bring me word . ”</l>
     <l n="40">To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere :</l>
     <l n="41">“ It is not meet , Sir King , to leave thee thus ,</l>
     <l n="42">Aidless , alone , and smitten thro ’ the helm .</l>
     <l n="43">A little thing may harm a wounded man .</l>
     <l n="44">Yet I thy hest will all perform at full ,</l>
     <l n="45">Watch what I see , and lightly bring thee word . ”</l>
     <l n="46">So saying , from the ruin 'd shrine he stept</l>
     <l n="47">And in the moon athwart the place of tombs ,</l>
     <l n="48">Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men ,</l>
     <l n="49">Old knights , and over them the sea-wind sang</l>
     <l n="50">Shrill , chill , with flakes of foam . He , stepping down</l>
     <l n="51">By zig-zag paths , and juts of pointed rock ,</l>
     <l n="52">Came on the shining levels of the lake .</l>
     <l n="53">There drew he forth the brand Excalibur ,</l>
     <l n="54">And o'er him , drawing it , the winter moon ,</l>
     <l n="55">Brightening the skirts of a long cloud , ran forth</l>
     <l n="56">And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt :</l>
     <l n="57">For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks ,<span corresp="#note3_32" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></l>
     <l n="58">Myriads of topaz-lights , and jacinth-work</l>
     <l n="59">Of subtlest jewellery . He gazed so long</l>
     <l n="60">That both his eyes were dazzled , as he stood ,</l>
     <l n="61">This way and that dividing the swift mind ,<span corresp="#note4_29" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span></l>
     <l n="62">In act to throw : but at the last it seem 'd</l>
     <l n="63">Better to leave Excalibur conceal 'd</l>
     <l n="64">There in the many-knotted waterflags ,</l>
     <l n="65">That whistled stiff and dry about the marge .</l>
     <l n="66">So strode he back slow to the wounded king .</l>
     <l n="67">Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere :</l>
     <l n="68">“ Hast thou perform 'd my mission which I gave ?</l>
     <l n="69">What is it thou hast seen ? or what hast heard ? ”</l>
     <l n="70">And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere :</l>
     <l n="71">“ I heard the ripple washing in the reeds ,<span corresp="#note5_23" type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span></l>
     <l n="72">And the wild water lapping on the crag . ”</l>
     <l n="73">To whom replied King Arthur , faint and pale :</l>
     <l n="74">“ Thou hast betray 'd thy nature and thy name ,</l>
     <l n="75">Not rendering true answer , as beseem 'd</l>
     <l n="76">Thy fëalty , nor like a noble knight :</l>
     <l n="77">For surer sign had follow 'd , either hand ,</l>
     <l n="78">Or voice , or else a motion of the mere .</l>
     <l n="79">This is a shameful thing for men to lie .</l>
     <l n="80">Yet now , I charge thee , quickly go again<span corresp="#note6_27" type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span></l>
     <l n="81">As thou art lief and dear , and do the thing</l>
     <l n="82">I bade thee , watch , and lightly bring me word . ”</l>
     <l n="83">Then went Sir Bedivere the second time</l>
     <l n="84">Across the ridge , and paced beside the mere ,<span corresp="#note7_16" type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span></l>
     <l n="85">Counting the dewy pebbles , fix 'd in thought ;</l>
     <l n="86">But when he saw the wonder of the hilt ,</l>
     <l n="87">How curiously and strangely chased , he smote</l>
     <l n="88">His palms together , and he cried aloud ,</l>
     <l n="89">“ And if indeed I cast the brand away ,</l>
     <l n="90">Surely a precious thing , one worthy note ,</l>
     <l n="91">Should thus be lost for ever from the earth ,</l>
     <l n="92">Which might have pleased the eyes of many men .</l>
     <l n="93">What good should follow this , if this were done ?</l>
     <l n="94">What harm , undone ? deep harm to disobey ,</l>
     <l n="95">Seeing obedience is the bond of rule ,</l>
     <l n="96">Were it well to obey then , if a king demand</l>
     <l n="97">An act unprofitable against himself ?</l>
     <l n="98">The king is sick , and knows not what he does .</l>
     <l n="99">What record , or what relic of my lord</l>
     <l n="100">Should be to aftertime , but empty breath</l>
     <l n="101">And rumours of a doubt ? but were this kept ,</l>
     <l n="102">Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings ,</l>
     <l n="103">Some one might show it at a joust of arms ,</l>
     <l n="104">Saying , ‘ King Arthur 's sword , Excalibur ,</l>
     <l n="105">Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake .</l>
     <l n="106">Nine years she wrought it , sitting in the deeps</l>
     <l n="107">Upon the hidden bases of the hills . ”</l>
     <l n="108">So might some old man speak in the aftertime</l>
     <l n="109">To all the people , winning reverence .</l>
     <l n="110">But now much honour and much fame were lost . ”</l>
     <l n="111">So spake he , clouded with his own conceit ,</l>
     <l n="112">And hid Excalibur the second time ,</l>
     <l n="113">And so strode back slow to the wounded King .</l>
     <l n="114">Then spoke King Arthur , breathing heavily :</l>
     <l n="115">“ What is it thou hast seen ? or what hast heard ? ”</l>
     <l n="116">And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere :</l>
     <l n="117">“ I heard the water lapping on the crag ,</l>
     <l n="118">And the long ripple washing in the reeds . ”</l>
     <l n="119">To whom replied King Arthur , much in wrath :</l>
     <l n="120">“ Ah , miserable and unkind , untrue ,<span corresp="#note8_14" type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span></l>
     <l n="121">Unknightly , traitor-hearted ! Woe is me !</l>
     <l n="122">Authority forgets a dying king ,<span corresp="#note9_14" type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span></l>
     <l n="123">Laid widow 'd of the power in his eye</l>
     <l n="124">That bow 'd the will . I see thee what thou art ,</l>
     <l n="125">For thou , the latest-left of all my knights ,</l>
     <l n="126">In whom should meet the offices of all ,</l>
     <l n="127">Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt ;</l>
     <l n="128">Either from lust of gold , or like a girl</l>
     <l n="129">Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes .</l>
     <l n="130">Yet , for a man may fail in duty twice ,</l>
     <l n="131">And the third time may prosper , get thee hence :</l>
     <l n="132">But , if thou spare to fling Excalibur ,</l>
     <l n="133">I will arise and slay thee with my hands . ”</l>
     <l n="134">Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere , and ran ,<span corresp="#note10_12" type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span></l>
     <l n="135">And , leaping down the ridges lightly , plunged</l>
     <l n="136">Among the bulrush-beds , and clutch 'd the sword ,</l>
     <l n="137">And strongly wheel 'd and threw it . The great brand</l>
     <l n="138">Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon ,</l>
     <l n="139">And flashing round and round , and whirl 'd in an arch ,</l>
     <l n="140">Shot like a streamer of the northern morn ,</l>
     <l n="141">Seen where the moving isles of winter shock</l>
     <l n="142">By night , with noises of the northern sea .</l>
     <l n="143">So flash 'd and fell the brand Excalibur :</l>
     <l n="144">But ere he dipt the surface , rose an arm</l>
     <l n="145">Clothed in white samite , mystic , wonderful ,</l>
     <l n="146">And caught him by the hilt , and brandish 'd him</l>
     <l n="147">Three times , and drew him under in the mere .</l>
     <l n="148">And lightly went the other to the King .</l>
     <l n="149">Then spoke King Arthur , drawing thicker breath :</l>
     <l n="150">“ Now see I by thine eyes that this is done .</l>
     <l n="151">Speak out : what is it thou hast heard , or seen ? ”</l>
     <l n="152">And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere :</l>
     <l n="153">“ Sir King , I closed mine eyelids , lest the gems</l>
     <l n="154">Should blind my purpose , for I never saw ,</l>
     <l n="155">Nor shall see , here or elsewhere , till I die ,</l>
     <l n="156">Not tho ’ I live three lives of mortal men ,</l>
     <l n="157">So great a miracle as yonder hilt .</l>
     <l n="158">Then with both hands I flung him , wheeling him ;</l>
     <l n="159">But when I look 'd again , behold an arm ,</l>
     <l n="160">Clothed in white samite , mystic , wonderful ,</l>
     <l n="161">That caught him by the hilt , and brandish 'd him</l>
     <l n="162">Three times , and drew him under in the mere . ”</l>
     <l n="163">And answer made King Arthur , breathing hard :</l>
     <l n="164">“ My end draws nigh ;' tis time that I were gone .</l>
     <l n="165">Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight ,</l>
     <l n="166">And bear me to the margin ; yet I fear<span corresp="#note11_12" type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span></l>
     <l n="167">My wound hath taken cold , and I shall die . ”</l>
     <l n="168">So saying , from the pavement he hath rose ,</l>
     <l n="169">Slowly , with pain , reclining on his arm ,</l>
     <l n="170">And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes</l>
     <l n="171">As in a picture . Him Sir Bedivere</l>
     <l n="172">Remorsefully regarded thro ’ his tears ,</l>
     <l n="173">And would have spoken , but he found not words ,</l>
     <l n="174">Then took with care , and kneeling on one knee ,</l>
     <l n="175">O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands ,</l>
     <l n="176">And rising bore him thro ’ the place of tombs .</l>
     <l n="177">But , as he walk 'd , King Arthur panted hard ,</l>
     <l n="178">Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed</l>
     <l n="179">When all the house is mute . So sigh 'd the King ,</l>
     <l n="180">Muttering and murmuring at his ear ”</l>
     <l n="181">Quick , quick ! I fear it is too late , and I shall die “ .</l>
     <l n="182">But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge ,</l>
     <l n="183">Clothed with his breath , and looking , as he walk 'd ,</l>
     <l n="184">Larger than human on the frozen hills .</l>
     <l n="185">He heard the deep behind him , and a cry</l>
     <l n="186">Before . His own thought drove him like a goad .</l>
     <l n="187">Dry clash 'd his harness in the icy caves</l>
     <l n="188">And barren chasms , and all to left and right</l>
     <l n="189">The bare black cliff clang 'd round him , as he based</l>
     <l n="190">His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang</l>
     <l n="191">Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels —</l>
     <l n="192">And on a sudden , lo ! the level lake ,</l>
     <l n="193">And the long glories of the winter moon .</l>
     <l n="194">Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge ,<span corresp="#note12_11" type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span></l>
     <l n="195">Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern ,</l>
     <l n="196">Beneath them ; and descending they were ware</l>
     <l n="197">That all the decks were dense with stately forms</l>
     <l n="198">Black-stoled , black-hooded , like a dream — by these</l>
     <l n="199">Three Queens with crowns of gold — and from them rose</l>
     <l n="200">A cry that shiver 'd to the tingling stars ,</l>
     <l n="201">And , as it were one voice , an agony</l>
     <l n="202">Of lamentation , like a wind , that shrills</l>
     <l n="203">All night in a waste land , where no one comes ,</l>
     <l n="204">Or hath come , since the making of the world .</l>
     <l n="205">Then murmur 'd Arthur , “ Place me in the barge , ”</l>
     <l n="206">And to the barge they came . There those three Queens</l>
     <l n="207">Put forth their hands , and took the King , and wept .</l>
     <l n="208">But she , that rose the tallest of them all</l>
     <l n="209">And fairest , laid his head upon her lap ,</l>
     <l n="210">And loosed the shatter 'd casque , and chafed his hands ,</l>
     <l n="211">And call 'd him by his name , complaining loud ,</l>
     <l n="212">And dropping bitter tears against his brow</l>
     <l n="213">Striped with dark blood : for all his face was white</l>
     <l n="214">And colourless , and like the wither 'd moon</l>
     <l n="215">Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east ;</l>
     <l n="216">And all his greaves and cuisses dash 'd with drops</l>
     <l n="217">Of onset ; and the light and lustrous curls —</l>
     <l n="218">That made his forehead like a rising sun</l>
     <l n="219">High from the däis-throne — were parch 'd with dust ;</l>
     <l n="220">Or , clotted into points and hanging loose ,</l>
     <l n="221">Mix 'd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips .</l>
     <l n="222">So like a shatter 'd column lay the King ;</l>
     <l n="223">Not like that Arthur who , with lance in rest ,</l>
     <l n="224">From spur to plume a star of tournament ,</l>
     <l n="225">Shot thro ’ the lists at Camelot , and charged</l>
     <l n="226">Before the eyes of ladies and of kings .</l>
     <l n="227">Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere ,<span corresp="#note13_10" type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span></l>
     <l n="228">“ Ah ! my Lord Arthur , whither shall I go ?</l>
     <l n="229">Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes ?</l>
     <l n="230">For now I see the true old times are dead ,</l>
     <l n="231">When every morning brought a noble chance ,</l>
     <l n="232">And every chance brought out a noble knight .</l>
     <l n="233">Such times have been not since the light that led</l>
     <l n="234">The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh .</l>
     <l n="235">But now the whole ROUND TABLE is dissolved</l>
     <l n="236">Which was an image of the mighty world ;</l>
     <l n="237">And I , the last , go forth companionless .</l>
     <l n="238">And the days darken round me , and the years ,</l>
     <l n="239">Among new men , strange faces , other minds . ”</l>
     <l n="240">And slowly answer 'd Arthur from the barge :</l>
     <l n="241">“ The old order changeth , yielding place to new ,</l>
     <l n="242">And God fulfils Himself in many ways ,<span corresp="#note14_8" type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span></l>
     <l n="243">Lest one good custom should corrupt the world .</l>
     <l n="244">Comfort thyself : what comfort is in me ?</l>
     <l n="245">I have lived my life , and that which I have done</l>
     <l n="246">May He within Himself make pure ! but thou ,</l>
     <l n="247">If thou shouldst never see my face again ,</l>
     <l n="248">Pray for my soul . More things are wrought by prayer</l>
     <l n="249">Than this world dreams of . Wherefore , let thy voice</l>
     <l n="250">Rise like a fountain for me night and day .</l>
     <l n="251">For what are men better than sheep or goats</l>
     <l n="252">That nourish a blind life within the brain ,</l>
     <l n="253">If , knowing God , they lift not hands of prayer</l>
     <l n="254">Both for themselves and those who call them friend ?</l>
     <l n="255">For so the whole round earth is every way</l>
     <l n="256">Bound by gold chains<span corresp="#note15_7" type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>about the feet of God .</l>
     <l n="257">But now farewell . I am going a long way</l>

     <l n="259">( For all my mind is clouded with a doubt )</l>
     <l n="260">To the island-valley of Avilion ;</l>
     <l n="261">Where falls not hail , or rain ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>or any snow ,</l>
     <l n="262">Nor ever wind blows loudly ; but it lies</l>
     <l n="263">Deep-meadow 'd , happy , fair with orchard-lawns</l>

     <l n="265">Where I will heal me of my grievous wound . ”</l>
     <l n="266">So said he , and the barge with oar and sail</l>
     <l n="267">Moved from the brink , like some full-breasted swan</l>
     <l n="268">That , fluting a wild carol ere her death ,</l>
     <l n="269">Ruffles her pure cold plume , and takes the flood</l>
     <l n="270">With swarthy webs . Long stood Sir Bedivere</l>
     <l n="271">Revolving many memories , till the hull</l>
     <l n="272">Look 'd one black dot against the verge of dawn .</l>

     <l n="277">And waked with silence , grunted “ Good ! ” but we</l>

    <head>THE GARDENER 'S DAUGHTER ; OR , THE PICTURES</head>
     <l n="1">First published in 1842 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In the ‘ Gardener 's Daughter ’ we have the first of that delightful series of poems dealing with scenes and characters from ordinary English life , and named appropriately ‘ English Idylls ’ . The originator of this species of poetry in England was Southey , in his ‘ English Eclogues ’ , written before 1799 . In the preface to these eclogues , which are in blank verse , Southey says : “ The following eclogues , I believe , bear no resemblance to any poems in our language . This species of composition has become popular in Germany , and I was induced to attempt it by an account of the German idylls given me in conversation . ” Southey 's eclogues are eight in number : ‘ The Old Mansion House ’ , ‘ The Grandmother 's Tale ’ , ‘ Hannah ’ , ‘ The Sailor 's Mother ’ , ‘ The Witch ’ , ‘ The Ruined Cottage ’ , ‘ The Last of the Family ’ and ‘ The Alderman 's Funeral ’ . Southey was followed by Wordsworth in ‘ The Brothers ’ and ‘ Michael ’ . Southey has nothing of the charm , grace and classical finish of his disciple , but how nearly Tennyson follows him , as copy and model , may be seen by anyone who compares Tennyson 's studies with ‘ The Ruined Cottage ’ . But Tennyson 's real master was Theocritus , whose influence pervades these poems not so much directly in definite imitation as indirectly in colour and tone .</p>
   <p>‘ The Gardener 's Daughter ’ was written as early as 1835 , as it was read to Fitzgerald in that year ( ‘ Life of Tennyson ’ , i ., 182 ) . Tennyson originally intended to insert a prologue to be entitled ‘ The Antechamber ’ , which contained an elaborate picture of himself , but he afterwards suppressed it . It is given in the ‘ Life ’ , i ., 233-4 . This poem stands alone among the Idylls in being somewhat overloaded with ornament . The text of 1842 remained unaltered through all the subsequent editions except in line 235 . After 1851 the form “ tho ’ ” is substituted for “ though ” .</p>

     <l n="1">This morning is the morning of the day ,</l>
     <l n="2">When I and Eustace from the city went</l>
     <l n="3">To see the Gardener 's Daughter ; I and he ,</l>
     <l n="4">Brothers in Art ; a friendship so complete</l>
     <l n="5">Portion 'd in halves between us , that we grew</l>
     <l n="6">The fable of the city where we dwelt .</l>
     <l n="7">My Eustace might have sat for Hercules ;</l>
     <l n="8">So muscular he spread , so broad of breast .</l>

     <l n="10">The greater to the lesser , long desired</l>
     <l n="11">A certain miracle of symmetry ,</l>
     <l n="12">A miniature of loveliness , all grace</l>
     <l n="13">Summ 'd up and closed in little ;— Juliet , she<span corresp="#note1_51" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></l>
     <l n="14">So light of foot , so light of spirit — oh , she</l>
     <l n="15">To me myself , for some three careless moons ,</l>
     <l n="16">The summer pilot of an empty heart</l>
     <l n="17">Unto the shores of nothing ! Know you not</l>
     <l n="18">Such touches are but embassies of love ,</l>
     <l n="19">To tamper with the feelings , ere he found</l>
     <l n="20">Empire for life ? but Eustace painted her ,</l>
     <l n="21">And said to me , she sitting with us then ,</l>
     <l n="22">“ When will you paint like this ? ” and I replied ,</l>
     <l n="23">( My words were half in earnest , half in jest ) ,</l>
     <l n="24">“ ‘ Tis not your work , but Love 's . Love , unperceived ,</l>

     <l n="27">Darker than darkest pansies , and that hair</l>
     <l n="28">More black than ashbuds in the front of March . ”</l>
     <l n="29">And Juliet answer 'd laughing , “ Go and see</l>
     <l n="30">The Gardener 's daughter : trust me , after that ,</l>
     <l n="31">You scarce can fail to match his masterpiece “ .</l>

     <l n="38">The windy clanging of the minster clock ;</l>
     <l n="39">Although between it and the garden lies</l>
     <l n="40">A league of grass , wash 'd by a slow broad stream ,</l>
     <l n="41">That , stirr 'd with languid pulses of the oar ,</l>
     <l n="42">Waves all its lazy lilies , and creeps on ,</l>
     <l n="43">Barge-laden , to three arches of a bridge</l>

     <l n="49">In that still place she , hoarded in herself ,</l>
     <l n="50">Grew , seldom seen : not less among us lived</l>
     <l n="51">Her fame from lip to lip . Who had not heard</l>

     <l n="53">So blunt in memory , so old at heart ,</l>
     <l n="54">At such a distance from his youth in grief ,</l>
     <l n="55">That , having seen , forgot ? The common mouth ,</l>
     <l n="56">So gross to express delight , in praise of her</l>
     <l n="57">Grew oratory . Such a lord is Love ,</l>

     <l n="103">And I made answer , “ Were there nothing else</l>
     <l n="104">For which to praise the heavens but only love ,</l>
     <l n="105">That only love were cause enough for praise ” .</l>
     <l n="106">Lightly he laugh 'd , as one that read my thought ,</l>
     <l n="107">And on we went ; but ere an hour had pass 'd ,</l>
     <l n="108">We reach 'd a meadow slanting to the North ;</l>
     <l n="109">Down which a well-worn pathway courted us</l>
     <l n="110">To one green wicket in a privet hedge ;</l>
     <l n="111">This , yielding , gave into a grassy walk</l>
     <l n="112">Thro ’ crowded lilac-ambush trimly pruned ;</l>
     <l n="113">And one warm gust , full-fed with perfume , blew</l>
     <l n="114">Beyond us , as we enter 'd in the cool .</l>
     <l n="115">The garden stretches southward . In the midst</l>
     <l n="116">A cedar spread his dark-green layers of shade .</l>
     <l n="117">The garden-glasses shone , and momently</l>
     <l n="118">The twinkling laurel scatter 'd silver lights .</l>
     <l n="119">“ Eustace , ” I said , “ This wonder keeps the house . ”</l>
     <l n="120">He nodded , but a moment afterwards</l>
     <l n="121">He cried , “ Look ! look ! ” Before he ceased I turn 'd ,</l>
     <l n="122">And , ere a star can wink , beheld her there .</l>
     <l n="123">For up the porch there grew an Eastern rose ,</l>
     <l n="124">That , flowering high , the last night 's gale had caught ,</l>
     <l n="125">And blown across the walk . One arm aloft —</l>
     <l n="126">Gown 'd in pure white , that fitted to the shape —</l>
     <l n="127">Holding the bush , to fix it back , she stood .</l>
     <l n="128">A single stream of all her soft brown hair</l>
     <l n="129">Pour 'd on one side : the shadow of the flowers</l>
     <l n="130">Stole all the golden gloss , and , wavering</l>
     <l n="131">Lovingly lower , trembled on her waist —</l>
     <l n="132">Ah , happy shade — and still went wavering down ,</l>
     <l n="133">But , ere it touch 'd a foot , that might have danced</l>
     <l n="134">The greensward into greener circles , dipt ,</l>
     <l n="135">And mix 'd with shadows of the common ground !</l>
     <l n="136">But the full day dwelt on her brows , and sunn 'd</l>
     <l n="137">Her violet eyes , and all her Hebe-bloom ,</l>
     <l n="138">And doubled his own warmth against her lips ,</l>
     <l n="139">And on the bounteous wave of such a breast</l>
     <l n="140">As never pencil drew . Half light , half shade ,</l>
     <l n="141">She stood , a sight to make an old man young .</l>
     <l n="142">So rapt , we near 'd the house ; but she , a Rose</l>
     <l n="143">In roses , mingled with her fragrant toil ,</l>
     <l n="144">Nor heard us come , nor from her tendance turn 'd</l>
     <l n="145">Into the world without ; till close at hand ,</l>
     <l n="146">And almost ere I knew mine own intent ,</l>
     <l n="147">This murmur broke the stillness of that air</l>
     <l n="148">Which brooded round about her : “ Ah , one rose ,</l>
     <l n="149">One rose , but one , by those fair fingers cull 'd ,</l>
     <l n="150">Were worth a hundred kisses press 'd on lips</l>
     <l n="151">Less exquisite than thine . ” She look 'd : but all</l>
     <l n="152">Suffused with blushes — neither self-possess 'd</l>
     <l n="153">Nor startled , but betwixt this mood and that ,</l>
     <l n="154">Divided in a graceful quiet — paused ,</l>
     <l n="155">And dropt the branch she held , and turning , wound</l>
     <l n="156">Her looser hair in braid , and stirr 'd her lips</l>
     <l n="157">For some sweet answer , tho ’ no answer came ,</l>
     <l n="158">Nor yet refused the rose , but granted it ,</l>
     <l n="159">And moved away , and left me , statue-like ,</l>
     <l n="160">In act to render thanks . I , that whole day ,</l>
     <l n="161">Saw her no more , altho ’ I linger 'd there</l>
     <l n="162">Till every daisy slept , and Love 's white star</l>
     <l n="163">Beam 'd thro ’ the thicken 'd cedar in the dusk .</l>
     <l n="164">So home we went , and all the livelong way</l>
     <l n="165">With solemn gibe did Eustace banter me .</l>
     <l n="166">“ Now , ” said he , “ will you climb the top of Art ;</l>
     <l n="167">You cannot fail but work in hues to dim</l>
     <l n="168">The Titianic Flora . Will you match</l>
     <l n="169">My Juliet ? you , not you ,— the Master ,</l>
     <l n="170">Love , A more ideal Artist he than all . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="171">So home I went , but could not sleep for joy ,</l>
     <l n="172">Reading her perfect features in the gloom ,</l>
     <l n="173">Kissing the rose she gave me o'er and o'er ,</l>
     <l n="174">And shaping faithful record of the glance</l>
     <l n="175">That graced the giving — such a noise of life</l>
     <l n="176">Swarm 'd in the golden present , such a voice</l>
     <l n="177">Call 'd to me from the years to come , and such</l>
     <l n="178">A length of bright horizon rimm 'd the dark .</l>
     <l n="179">And all that night I heard the watchmen peal</l>
     <l n="180">The sliding season : all that night I heard</l>
     <l n="181">The heavy clocks knolling the drowsy hours .</l>
     <l n="182">The drowsy hours , dispensers of all good ,</l>
     <l n="183">O'er the mute city stole with folded wings ,</l>
     <l n="184">Distilling odours on me as they went</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="186">Love at first sight , first-born , and heir to all ,</l>

     <l n="229">More musical than ever came in one ,</l>
     <l n="230">The silver fragments of a broken voice ,</l>

    <head>DORA</head>
     <l n="1">First published in 1842 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This poem had been written as early as 1835 , when it was read to Fitzgerald and Spedding ( ‘ Life ’ , i ., 182 ) . No alterations were made in the text after 1853 . The story in this poem was taken even to the minutest details from a prosestory of Miss Mitford 's , namely , ‘ The Tale of Dora Creswell ’ ( ‘ Our Village ’ , vol . in ., 242-53 ) , the only alterations being in the names , Farmer Cresswell , Dora Creswell , Walter Cresswell , and Mary Hay becoming respectively Allan , Dora , William , and Mary Morrison . How carefully the poet has preserved the picturesque touches of the original may be seen by comparing the following two passages :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">And Dora took the child , and went her way</l>
     <l n="2">Across the wheat , and sat upon a mound</l>
     <l n="3">That was unsown , where many poppies grew .</l>
     <l n="4">...</l>
     <l n="5">She rose and took</l>
     <l n="6">The child once more , and sat upon the mound ;</l>
     <l n="7">And made a little wreath of all the flowers</l>
     <l n="8">That grew about , and tied it round his hat .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ A beautiful child lay on the ground at some distance , whilst a young girl , resting from the labour of reaping , was twisting a rustic wreath of enamelled cornflowers , brilliant poppies ... round its hat . ”</p>
   <p>The style is evidently modelled closely on that of the ‘ Odyssey ’ .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">With farmer Allan at the farm abode</l>
     <l n="2">William and Dora . William was his son ,</l>
     <l n="3">And she his niece . He often look 'd at them ,</l>
     <l n="4">And often thought “ I 'll make them man and wife ” .</l>
     <l n="5">Now Dora felt her uncle 's will in all ,</l>
     <l n="6">And yearn 'd towards William ; but the youth , because</l>
     <l n="7">He had been always with her in the house ,</l>
     <l n="8">Thought not of Dora . Then there came a day</l>
     <l n="9">When Allan call 'd his son , and said ,</l>
     <l n="10">“ My son : I married late , but I would wish to see</l>
     <l n="11">My grandchild on my knees before I die :</l>
     <l n="12">And I have set my heart upon a match .</l>
     <l n="13">Now therefore look to Dora ; she is well</l>
     <l n="14">To look to ; thrifty too beyond her age .</l>
     <l n="15">She is my brother 's daughter : he and I</l>
     <l n="16">Had once hard words , and parted , and he died</l>
     <l n="17">In foreign lands ; but for his sake I bred</l>
     <l n="18">His daughter Dora : take her for your wife ;</l>
     <l n="19">For I have wish 'd this marriage , night and day ,</l>
     <l n="20">For many years . ” But William answer 'd short ;</l>
     <l n="21">“ I cannot marry Dora ; by my life ,</l>
     <l n="22">I will not marry Dora ” . Then the old man</l>
     <l n="23">Was wroth , and doubled up his hands , and said :</l>
     <l n="24">“ You will not , boy ! you dare to answer thus !</l>
     <l n="25">But in my time a father 's word was law ,</l>
     <l n="26">And so it shall be now for me . Look to it ;</l>
     <l n="27">Consider , William : take a month to think ,</l>
     <l n="28">And let me have an answer to my wish ;</l>
     <l n="29">Or , by the Lord that made me , you shall pack ,</l>
     <l n="30">And never more darken my doors again . ”</l>
     <l n="31">But William answer 'd madly ; bit his lips ,</l>
     <l n="32">And broke away .<span corresp="#note1_52" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The more he look 'd at her</l>
     <l n="33">The less he liked her ; and his ways were harsh ;</l>
     <l n="34">But Dora bore them meekly . Then before</l>
     <l n="35">The month was out he left his father 's house ,</l>
     <l n="36">And hired himself to work within the fields ;</l>
     <l n="37">And half in love , half spite , he woo 'd and wed</l>
     <l n="38">A labourer 's daughter , Mary Morrison .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="39">Then , when the bells were ringing ,</l>
     <l n="40">Allan call 'd His niece and said : “ My girl , I love you well ;</l>
     <l n="41">But if you speak with him that was my son ,</l>
     <l n="42">Or change a word with her he calls his wife ,</l>
     <l n="43">My home is none of yours . My will is law . ”</l>
     <l n="44">And Dora promised , being meek . She thought ,</l>
     <l n="45">“ It cannot be : my uncle 's mind will change ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="46">And days went on , and there was born a boy</l>
     <l n="47">To William ; then distresses came on him ;</l>
     <l n="48">And day by day he pass 'd his father 's gate ,</l>
     <l n="49">Heart-broken , and his father helped him not .</l>
     <l n="50">But Dora stored what little she could save ,</l>
     <l n="51">And sent it them by stealth , nor did they know</l>
     <l n="52">Who sent it ; till at last a fever seized</l>
     <l n="53">On William , and in harvest time he died .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="54">Then Dora went to Mary . Mary sat</l>
     <l n="55">And look 'd with tears upon her boy , and thought</l>
     <l n="56">Hard things of Dora . Dora came and said :</l>
     <l n="57">“ I have obey 'd my uncle until now ,</l>
     <l n="58">And I have sinn 'd , for it was all thro ’ me</l>
     <l n="59">This evil came on William at the first .</l>
     <l n="60">But , Mary , for the sake of him that 's gone ,</l>
     <l n="61">And for your sake , the woman that he chose ,</l>
     <l n="62">And for this orphan , I am come to you :</l>
     <l n="63">You know there has not been for these five years</l>
     <l n="64">So full a harvest , let me take the boy ,</l>
     <l n="65">And I will set him in my uncle 's eye</l>
     <l n="66">Among the wheat ; that when his heart is glad</l>
     <l n="67">Of the full harvest , he may see the boy ,</l>
     <l n="68">And bless him for the sake of him that 's gone . ”</l>
     <l n="69">And Dora took the child , and went her way</l>
     <l n="70">Across the wheat , and sat upon a mound</l>
     <l n="71">That was unsown , where many poppies grew .</l>
     <l n="72">Far off the farmer came into the field</l>
     <l n="73">And spied her not ; for none of all his men</l>
     <l n="74">Dare tell him Dora waited with the child ;</l>
     <l n="75">And Dora would have risen and gone to him ,</l>
     <l n="76">But her heart fail 'd her ; and the reapers reap 'd</l>
     <l n="77">And the sun fell , and all the land was dark .</l>
     <l n="78">But when the morrow came , she rose and took</l>
     <l n="79">The child once more , and sat upon the mound ;</l>
     <l n="80">And made a little wreath of all the flowers</l>
     <l n="81">That grew about , and tied it round his hat</l>
     <l n="82">To make him pleasing in her uncle 's eye .</l>
     <l n="83">Then when the farmer passed into the field</l>
     <l n="84">He spied her , and he left his men at work ,</l>
     <l n="85">And came and said : “ Where were you yesterday ?</l>
     <l n="86">Whose child is that ? What are you doing here ? ”</l>
     <l n="87">So Dora cast her eyes upon the ground ,</l>
     <l n="88">And answer 'd softly , “ This is William 's child ? ”</l>
     <l n="89">“ And did I not , ” said Allan , “ did I not</l>
     <l n="90">Forbid you , Dora ? ” Dora said again :</l>
     <l n="91">“ Do with me as you will , but take the child</l>
     <l n="92">And bless him for the sake of him that 's gone ! ”</l>
     <l n="93">And Allan said : “ I see it is a trick</l>
     <l n="94">Got up betwixt you and the woman there .</l>
     <l n="95">I must be taught my duty , and by you !</l>
     <l n="96">You knew my word was law , and yet you dared</l>
     <l n="97">To slight it . Well — for I will take the boy ;</l>
     <l n="98">But go you hence , and never see me more . ”</l>
     <l n="99">So saying , he took the boy , that cried aloud</l>
     <l n="100">And struggled hard . The wreath of flowers fell</l>
     <l n="101">At Dora 's feet . She bow 'd upon her hands ,</l>
     <l n="102">And the boy 's cry came to her from the field ,</l>
     <l n="103">More and more distant . She bow 'd down her head ,</l>
     <l n="104">Remembering the day when first she came ,</l>
     <l n="105">And all the things that had been . She bow 'd down</l>
     <l n="106">And wept in secret ; and the reapers reap 'd ,</l>
     <l n="107">And the sun fell , and all the land was dark .</l>
     <l n="108">Then Dora went to Mary 's house , and stood</l>
     <l n="109">Upon the threshold . Mary saw the boy</l>
     <l n="110">Was not with Dora . She broke out in praise</l>
     <l n="111">To God , that help 'd her in her widowhood .</l>
     <l n="112">And Dora said , “ My uncle took the boy ;</l>
     <l n="113">But , Mary , let me live and work with you :</l>
     <l n="114">He says that he will never see me more ” .</l>
     <l n="115">Then answer 'd Mary , “ This shall never be ,</l>
     <l n="116">That thou shouldst take my trouble on thyself :</l>
     <l n="117">And , now , I think , he shall not have the boy ,</l>
     <l n="118">For he will teach him hardness , and to slight</l>
     <l n="119">His mother ; therefore thou and I will go ,</l>
     <l n="120">And I will have my boy , and bring him home ;</l>
     <l n="121">And I will beg of him to take thee back ;</l>
     <l n="122">But if he will not take thee back again ,</l>
     <l n="123">Then thou and I will live within one house ,</l>
     <l n="124">And work for William 's child until he grows</l>
     <l n="125">Of age to help us . ” So the women kiss 'd</l>
     <l n="126">Each other , and set out , and reach 'd the farm .</l>
     <l n="127">The door was off the latch : they peep 'd , and saw</l>
     <l n="128">The boy set up betwixt his grandsire 's knees ,</l>
     <l n="129">Who thrust him in the hollows of his arm ,</l>
     <l n="130">And clapt him on the hands and on the cheeks ,</l>
     <l n="131">Like one that loved him ; and the lad stretch 'd out</l>
     <l n="132">And babbled for the golden seal , that hung</l>
     <l n="133">From Allan 's watch , and sparkled by the fire .</l>
     <l n="134">Then they came in : but when the boy beheld</l>
     <l n="135">His mother , he cried out to come to her :</l>
     <l n="136">And Allan set him down , and Mary said :</l>
     <l n="137">“ O Father !— if you let me call you so —</l>
     <l n="138">I never came a-begging for myself ,</l>
     <l n="139">Or William , or this child ; but now I come</l>
     <l n="140">For Dora : take her back ; she loves you well .</l>
     <l n="141">O Sir , when William died , he died at peace</l>
     <l n="142">With all men ; for I ask 'd him , and he said ,</l>
     <l n="143">He could not ever rue his marrying me —</l>
     <l n="144">I have been a patient wife : but , Sir , he said</l>
     <l n="145">That he was wrong to cross his father thus :</l>
     <l n="146">‘ God bless him ! ’ he said , ‘ and may he never know</l>
     <l n="147">The troubles I have gone thro ’ ! ' Then he turn 'd</l>
     <l n="148">His face and pass 'd — unhappy that I am !</l>
     <l n="149">But now , Sir , let me have my boy , for you</l>
     <l n="150">Will make him hard , and he will learn to slight</l>
     <l n="151">His father 's memory ; and take Dora back ,</l>
     <l n="152">And let all this be as it was before . ”</l>
     <l n="153">So Mary said , and Dora hid her face</l>
     <l n="154">By Mary . There was silence in the room ;</l>
     <l n="155">And all at once the old man burst in sobs :</l>
     <l n="156">“ I have been to blame — to blame . I have kill 'd my son .</l>
     <l n="157">I have kill 'd him — but I loved him — my dear son .</l>
     <l n="158">May God forgive me !— I have been to blame .</l>
     <l n="159">Kiss me , my children . ” Then they clung about</l>
     <l n="160">The old man 's neck , and kiss 'd him many times .</l>
     <l n="161">And all the man was broken with remorse ;</l>
     <l n="162">And all his love came back a hundredfold ;</l>
     <l n="163">And for three hours he sobb 'd o'er William 's child ,</l>
     <l n="164">Thinking of William . So those four abode</l>
     <l n="165">Within one house together ; and as years</l>
     <l n="166">Went forward , Mary took another mate ;</l>
     <l n="167">But Dora lived unmarried till her death .</l>

    <head>AUDLEY COURT</head>
     <l n="1">First published in 1842 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Only four alterations were made in the text after 1842 , all of which are duly noted . Tennyson told his son that the poem was partially suggested by Abbey Park at Torquay where it was written , and that the last lines described the scene from the hill looking over the bay . He saw he said “ a star of phosphorescence made by the buoy appearing and disappearing in the dark sea , ” but it is curious that the line describing that was not inserted till long after the poem had been published . The poem , though a trifle , is a triumph of felicitous description and expression , whether we regard the pie or the moonlit bay .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The Bull , the Fleece are cramm 'd , and not a room</l>
     <l n="2">For love or money . Let us picnic there</l>
     <l n="3">At Audley Court . ” I spoke , while Audley feast</l>
     <l n="4">Humm 'd like a hive all round the narrow quay ,</l>
     <l n="5">To Francis , with a basket on his arm ,</l>
     <l n="6">To Francis just alighted from the boat ,</l>
     <l n="7">And breathing of the sea . “ With all my heart , ”</l>
     <l n="8">Said Francis . Then we shoulder 'd thro ’<span corresp="#note1_53" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>the swarm ,</l>
     <l n="9">And rounded by the stillness of the beach</l>
     <l n="10">To where the bay runs up its latest horn .</l>
     <l n="11">We left the dying ebb that faintly lipp 'd</l>
     <l n="12">The flat red granite ; so by many a sweep</l>
     <l n="13">Of meadow smooth from aftermath we reach 'd</l>
     <l n="14">The griffin-guarded gates and pass 'd thro ’ all</l>
     <l n="15">The pillar 'd dusk<span corresp="#note2_44" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>of sounding sycamores</l>
     <l n="16">And cross 'd the garden to the gardener 's lodge ,</l>
     <l n="17">With all its casements bedded , and its walls</l>
     <l n="18">And chimneys muffled in the leafy vine .</l>
     <l n="19">There , on a slope of orchard , Francis laid</l>
     <l n="20">A damask napkin wrought with horse and hound ,</l>
     <l n="21">Brought out a dusky loaf that smelt of home ,</l>
     <l n="22">And , half-cut-down , a pasty costly-made ,</l>
     <l n="23">Where quail and pigeon , lark and leveret lay ,</l>
     <l n="24">Like fossils of the rock , with golden yolks<span corresp="#note3_34" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></l>
     <l n="25">Imbedded and injellied ; last with these ,</l>
     <l n="26">A flask of cider from his father 's vats ,</l>
     <l n="27">Prime , which I knew ; and so we sat and eat</l>
     <l n="28">And talk 'd old matters over ; who was dead ,</l>
     <l n="29">Who married , who was like to be , and how</l>
     <l n="30">The races went , and who would rent the hall :</l>
     <l n="31">Then touch 'd upon the game , how scarce it was</l>
     <l n="32">This season ; glancing thence , discuss 'd the farm ,</l>
     <l n="33">The fourfield system , and the price of grain ;<span corresp="#note4_31" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span></l>
     <l n="34">And struck upon the corn-laws , where we split ,</l>
     <l n="35">And came again together on the king</l>
     <l n="36">With heated faces ; till he laugh 'd aloud ;</l>
     <l n="37">And , while the blackbird on the pippin hung</l>
     <l n="38">To hear him , clapt his hand in mine and sang —</l>
     <l n="39">“ Oh ! who would fight and march and counter-march ,</l>
     <l n="40">Be shot for sixpence in a battle-field ,</l>
     <l n="41">And shovell 'd up into a<span corresp="#note5_25" type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>bloody trench</l>
     <l n="42">Where no one knows ? but let me live my life .</l>
     <l n="43">“ Oh ! who would cast and balance at a desk ,</l>
     <l n="44">Perch 'd like a crow upon a three-legg 'd stool ,</l>
     <l n="45">Till all his juice is dried , and all his joints</l>
     <l n="46">Are full of chalk ? but let me live my life .</l>
     <l n="47">“ Who 'd serve the state ? for if I carved my name</l>
     <l n="48">Upon the cliffs that guard my native land ,</l>
     <l n="49">I might as well have traced it in the sands ;</l>
     <l n="50">The sea wastes all : but let me live my life .</l>
     <l n="51">“ Oh ! who would love ? I wooed a woman once ,</l>
     <l n="52">But she was sharper than an eastern wind ,</l>
     <l n="53">And all my heart turn 'd from her , as a thorn</l>
     <l n="54">Turns from the sea : but let me live my life . ”</l>
     <l n="55">He sang his song , and I replied with mine :</l>
     <l n="56">I found it in a volume , all of songs ,</l>
     <l n="57">Knock 'd down to me , when old Sir Robert 's pride ,</l>
     <l n="58">His books — the more the pity , so I said —</l>
     <l n="59">Came to the hammer here in March — and this —</l>
     <l n="60">I set the words , and added names I knew .</l>
     <l n="61">“ Sleep , Ellen Aubrey , sleep and dream of me :</l>
     <l n="62">Sleep , Ellen , folded in thy sister 's arm ,</l>
     <l n="63">And sleeping , haply dream her arm is mine .</l>
     <l n="64">“ Sleep , Ellen , folded in Emilia 's arm ;</l>
     <l n="65">Emilia , fairer than all else but thou ,</l>
     <l n="66">For thou art fairer than all else that is .</l>
     <l n="67">“ Sleep , breathing health and peace upon her breast :</l>
     <l n="68">Sleep , breathing love and trust against her lip :</l>
     <l n="69">I go to-night : I come to-morrow morn .</l>
     <l n="70">“ I go , but I return : I would I were</l>
     <l n="71">The pilot of the darkness and the dream .</l>
     <l n="72">Sleep , Ellen Aubrey , love , and dream of me . ”</l>
     <l n="73">So sang we each to either , Francis Hale ,</l>
     <l n="74">The farmer 's son who lived across the bay ,</l>
     <l n="75">My friend ; and I , that having wherewithal ,</l>
     <l n="76">And in the fallow leisure of my life</l>
     <l n="77">A rolling stone of here and everywhere ,<span corresp="#note6_29" type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span></l>
     <l n="78">Did what I would ; but ere the night we rose</l>
     <l n="79">And saunter 'd home beneath a moon that , just</l>
     <l n="80">In crescent , dimly rain 'd about the leaf</l>
     <l n="81">Twilights of airy silver , till we reach 'd</l>
     <l n="82">The limit of the hills ; and as we sank</l>
     <l n="83">From rock to rock upon the gloomy quay ,</l>
     <l n="84">The town was hush 'd beneath us : lower down</l>
     <l n="85">The bay was oily-calm : the harbour buoy</l>
     <l n="86">With one green sparkle ever and anon<span corresp="#note7_18" type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span></l>

The Lincolnshire version of it is given in Miss Peacock 's MS. collection of Lincolnshire folk-lore , of which she has most kindly sent me a copy , and it runs thus :— “ There is a house in East Halton which is haunted by a hob-thrush .... Some years ago , it is said , a family who had lived in the house for more than a hundred years were much annoyed by it , and determined to quit the dwelling . They had placed their goods on a waggon , and were just on the point of starting when a neighbour asked the farmer whether he was leaving . On this the hobthrush put his head out of the splash-churn , which was amongst the household stuff , and said , ‘ Ay , we 're flitting ’ . Whereupon the farmer decided to give up the attempt to escape from it and remain where he was . ” The same story is told of a Cluricaune in Croker 's ‘ Fairy Legends and Traditions ’ in the South of Ireland . See ‘ The Haunted Cellar ’ in p. 81 of the edition of 1862 , and as Tennyson has elsewhere in ‘ Guinevere ’ borrowed a passage from the same story ( see ‘ Illustrations of Tennyson ’ , p. 152 ) it is probable that that was the source of the story here , though there the Cluricaune uses the expression , “ Here we go altogether ” .</note>

   <p>ST. SIMEON STYLITES</p>
   <p>First published in 1842 , reprinted in all the subsequent editions of the poems but with no alterations in the text , except that in eighth line from the end “ my ” was substituted for “ mine ” in 1846 . Tennyson informed a friend that it was not from the ‘ Acta Sanctorum ’ , but from Hone 's ‘ Every-Day Book ’ , vol . i ., pp . 35-36 , that he got the material for this poem , and a comparison with the narrative in Hone and the poem seems to show that this was the case .</p>
   <p>It is not easy to identify the St. Simeon Stylites of Hone 's narrative and Tennyson 's poem , whether he is to be identified with St. Simeon the Elder , of whom there are three memoirs given in the ‘ Acta Sanctorum ’ , tom . i ., 5th January , 261-286 , or with St. Simeon Stylites , Junior , of whom there is an elaborate biography in Greek by Nicephorus printed with a Latin translation and notes in the ‘ Acta Sanctorum ’ , tom . v ., 24th May , 298-401 . It seems clear that whoever compiled the account popularised by Hone had read both and amalgamated them . The main lines in the story of both saints are exactly the same . Both stood on columns , both tortured themselves in the same ways , both wrought miracles , and both died at their posts of penance . St. Simeon the Elder was born at Sisan in Syria about A. D. 390 , and was buried at Antioch in A. D. 459 or 460 . The Simeon the Younger was born at Antioch A. D. 521 and died in A. D. 592 . His life , which is of singular interest , is much more elaborately related .</p>
   <p>This poem is not simply a dramatic study . It bears very directly on Tennyson 's philosophy of life . In these early poems he has given us four studies in the morbid anatomy of character : ‘ The Palace of Art ’ , which illustrates the abuse of aesthetic and intellectual enjoyment of self ; ‘ The Vision of Sin ’ , which illustrates the effects of similar indulgence in the grosser pleasures of the senses ; ‘ The Two Voices ’ , which illustrates the mischief of despondent self-absorption , while the present poem illustrates the equally pernicious indulgence in an opposite extreme , asceticism affected for the mere gratification of personal vanity .</p>

   <note xml:id="note7_20" place="bottom" n="7">Tennyson has given a very poor substitute for the beautifully pathetic account given of the death of St. Simeon in ‘ Acta ’ , i ., 168 , and again in the ninth chapter of the second Life , ‘ Ibid ’ ., 273 . But this is to be explained perhaps by the moral purpose of the poem .</note>
   <p>THE TALKING OAK</p>
   <p>First published in 1842 , and republished in all subsequent editions with only two slight alterations : in line 113 a mere variant in spelling , and in line 185 , where in place of the present reading the editions between 1842 and 1848 read , “ For , ah ! the Dryad-days were brief ” .</p>
   <p>Tennyson told Mr. Aubrey de Vere that the poem was an experiment meant to test the degree in which it is in the power of poetry to humanise external nature . Tennyson might have remembered that Ovid had made the same experiment nearly two thousand years ago , while Goethe had immediately anticipated him in his charming ‘ Der Junggesett und der Mühlbach ’ . There was certainly no novelty in such an attempt . The poem is in parts charmingly written , but the oak is certainly “ garrulously given , ” and comes perilously near to tediousness .</p>

    <head>THE GOLDEN YEAR</head>
    <head>This poem was first published in the fourth edition of the poems 1846 . No alterations were made in it after 1851 . The poem had a message for the time at which it was written . The country was in a very troubled state . The contest between the Protectionists and Free-traders was at its acutest stage . The Maynooth endowment and the “ godless colleges ” had brought into prominence questions of the gravest moment in religion and education , while the Corn Bill and the Coercion Bill had inflamed the passions of party politicians almost to madness . Tennyson , his son tells us , entered heartily into these questions , believing that the remedies for these distempers lay in the spread of education , a more catholic spirit in the press , a partial adoption of Free Trade principles , and union as far as possible among the different sections of Christianity .</head>
     <l n="1">Well , you shall have that song which Leonard wrote :</l>
     <l n="2">It was last summer on a tour in Wales :</l>
     <l n="3">Old James was with me : we that day had been</l>
     <l n="4">Up Snowdon ; and I wish 'd for Leonard there ,</l>
     <l n="5">And found him in Llanberis :<span corresp="#note1_59" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>then we crost</l>
     <l n="6">Between the lakes , and clamber 'd half-way up</l>
     <l n="7">The counterside ; and that same song of his</l>
     <l n="8">He told me ; for I banter 'd him , and swore</l>
     <l n="9">They said he lived shut up within himself ,</l>
     <l n="10">A tongue-tied Poet in the feverous days ,</l>
     <l n="11">That , setting the how much before the how ,</l>
     <l n="12">Cry , like the daughters of the horseleech , “ Give ,<span corresp="#note2_50" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></l>
     <l n="13">Cram us with all , ” but count not me the herd !</l>
     <l n="14">To which “ They call me what they will , ” he said :</l>
     <l n="15">“ But I was born too late : the fair new forms ,</l>
     <l n="16">That float about the threshold of an age ,</l>
     <l n="17">Like truths of Science waiting to be caught —</l>
     <l n="18">Catch me who can , and make the catcher crown 'd —</l>
     <l n="19">Are taken by the forelock . Let it be .</l>
     <l n="20">But if you care indeed to listen , hear</l>
     <l n="21">These measured words , my work of yestermorn .</l>
     <l n="22">“ We sleep and wake and sleep , but all things move ;</l>
     <l n="23">The Sun flies forward to his brother Sun ;</l>
     <l n="24">The dark Earth follows wheel 'd in her ellipse ;</l>
     <l n="25">And human things returning on themselves</l>
     <l n="26">Move onward , leading up the golden year .</l>
     <l n="27">“ Ah , tho ’ the times , when some new thought can bud ,</l>
     <l n="28">Are but as poets ’ seasons when they flower ,</l>
     <l n="29">Yet seas , that daily gain upon the shore ,<span corresp="#note3_40" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></l>
     <l n="30">Have ebb and flow conditioning their march ,</l>
     <l n="31">And slow and sure comes up the golden year .</l>
     <l n="32">“ When wealth no more shall rest in mounded heaps ,</l>
     <l n="33">But smit with freer light shall slowly melt</l>
     <l n="34">In many streams to fatten lower lands ,</l>
     <l n="35">And light shall spread , and man be liker man</l>
     <l n="36">Thro ’ all the season of the golden year .</l>
     <l n="37">“ Shall eagles not be eagles ? wrens be wrens ?</l>
     <l n="38">If all the world were falcons , what of that ?</l>
     <l n="39">The wonder of the eagle were the less ,</l>
     <l n="40">But he not less the eagle . Happy days</l>
     <l n="41">Roll onward , leading up the golden year .</l>
     <l n="42">“ Fly happy happy sails and bear the Press ;</l>
     <l n="43">Fly happy with the mission of the Cross ;</l>
     <l n="44">Knit land to land , and blowing havenward</l>
     <l n="45">With silks , and fruits , and spices , clear of toll ,</l>
     <l n="46">Enrich the markets of the golden year .</l>
     <l n="47">“ But we grow old ! Ah ! when shall all men 's good</l>
     <l n="48">Be each man 's rule , and universal Peace</l>
     <l n="49">Lie like a shaft of light across the land ,</l>
     <l n="50">And like a lane of beams athwart the sea ,</l>
     <l n="51">Thro ’ all the circle of the golden year ? ”</l>
     <l n="52">Thus far he flow 'd , and ended ; whereupon</l>
     <l n="53">“ Ah , folly ! ” in mimic cadence answer 'd James —</l>
     <l n="54">“ Ah , folly ! for it lies so far away .</l>
     <l n="55">Not in our time , nor in our children 's time ,</l>
     <l n="56">‘ Tis like the second world to us that live ;</l>

     <l n="58">As on this vision of the golden year . ”</l>
     <l n="59">With that he struck his staff against the rocks</l>
     <l n="60">And broke it ,— James ,— you know him ,— old , but full</l>
     <l n="61">Of force and choler , and firm upon his feet ,</l>

    <head>ULYSSES</head>
     <l n="1">First published in 1842 , no alterations were made in it subsequently .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This noble poem , which is said to have induced Sir Robert Peel to give Tennyson his pension , was written soon after Arthur Hallam 's death , presumably therefore in 1833 . “ It gave my feeling , ” Tennyson said to his son , “ about the need of going forward and braving the struggle of life perhaps more simply than anything in ‘ In Memoriam ’ . ” It is not the ‘ Ulysses ’ of Homer , nor was it suggested by the ‘ Odyssey ’ . The germ , the spirit and the sentiment of the poem are from the twenty-sixth canto of Dante 's ‘ Inferno ’ , where Ulysses in the Limbo of the Deceivers speaks from the flame which swathes him . I give a literal version of the passage :—</p>
   <p>“ Neither fondness for my son nor reverence for my aged sire nor the due love which ought to have gladdened Penelope could conquer in me the ardour which I had to become experienced in the world and in human vice and worth . I put out into the deep open sea with but one ship and with that small company which had not deserted me .... I and my companions were old and tardy when we came to that narrow pass where Hercules assigned his landmarks . ‘ O brothers , ’ I said , ‘ who through a hundred thousand dangers have reached the West deny not to this the brief vigil of your senses that remain , experience of the unpeopled world beyond the sun . Consider your origin , ye were not formed to live like Brutes but to follow virtue and knowledge .... Night already saw the other pole with all its stars and ours so low that it rose not from the ocean floor ’ ”</p>
   <p>( ‘ Inferno ’ , xxvi ., 94-126 ) .</p>
   <p>But if the germ is here the expansion is Tennyson 's ; he has added elaboration and symmetry , fine touches , magical images and magical diction . There is nothing in Dante which answers to —</p>

   <note>Greek : ai ton Makaron naesoi</note>
   <p>of the Greeks , have been identified by geographers as those islands in the Atlantic off the west coast of Africa ; some take them to mean the Canary Islands , the Madeira group and the Azores , while they may have included the Cape de Verde Islands as well . What seems certain is that these places with their soft delicious climate and lovely scenery gave the poets an idea of a happy abode for departed spirits , and so the conception of the Elysian Fields . The loci classici on these abodes are Homer , Odyssey , iv ., 563 seqq . :—</p>
   <p>[ Greek : alla s ’ es Elysion pedion kai peirata gaiaes athanatoi pempsousin , hothi xanthos Rhadamanthus tae per rhaeistae biotae pelei anthropoisin , ou niphetos , out ’ ar cheimon polus , oute pot ’ ombros all ’ aiei Zephuroio ligu pneiontas aaetas okeanos aniaesin anapsuchein anthropous .</p>
   <p>[ But the Immortals will convey thee to the Elysian plain and the world 's limits where is Rhadamanthus of the golden hair , where life is easiest for man ; no snow is there , no nor no great storm , nor any rain , but always ocean sendeth forth the shrilly breezes of the West to cool and refresh men ] ,</p>
   <p>and Pindar , ‘ Olymp ’ ., ii ., 178 ‘ seqq ’ ., compared with the splendid fragment at the beginning of the ‘ Dirges ’ . Elysium was afterwards placed in the netherworld , as by Virgil . Thus , as so often the suggestion was from the facts of geography , the rest soon became an allegorical myth , and to attempt to identify and localise “ the Happy Isles ” is as great an absurdity as to attempt to identify and localise the island of Shakespeare 's ‘ Tempest ’ . ]</p>
   <p>LOCKSLEY HALL</p>
   <p>First published in 1842 , and no alterations were made in it subsequently to the edition of 1850 ; except that in the Selections published in 1865 in the third stanza the reading was “ half in ruin ” for “ in the distance ” . This poem , as Tennyson explained , was not autobiographic but purely imaginary , “ representing young life , its good side , its deficiences and its yearnings ” . The poem , he added , was written in Trochaics because the elder Hallam told him that the English people liked that metre . The hero is a sort of preliminary sketch of the hero in ‘ Maud ’ , the position and character of each being very similar : both are cynical and querulous , and break out into tirades against their kind and society ; both have been disappointed in love , and both find the same remedy for their afflictions by mixing themselves with action and becoming “ one with their kind ” .</p>
   <p>‘ Locksley Hall ’ was suggested , as Tennyson acknowledged , by Sir William Jones ’ translation of the old Arabian Moâllakât , a collection from the works of pre-Mahommedan poets . See Sir William Jones ’ works , quarto edition , vol . iv ., pp . 247-57 . But only one of these poems , namely the poem of Amriolkais , could have immediately influenced him . In this the poet supposes himself attended on a journey by a company of friends , and they pass near a place where his mistress had lately lived , but from which her tribe had then removed . He desires them to stop awhile , that he may weep over the deserted remains of her tent . They comply with his request , but exhort him to show more strength of mind , and urge two topics of consolation , namely , that he had before been equally unhappy and that he had enjoyed his full share of pleasures . Thus by the recollection of his past delights his imagination is kindled and his grief suspended . But Tennyson 's chief indebtedness is rather in the oriental colouring given to his poem , chiefly in the sentiment and imagery . Thus in the couplet —</p>

     <l n="3">The poem was written in 1840 when Tennyson was returning from Coventry</l>
     <l n="4">to London , after his visit to Warwickshire in that year . The Godiva</l>
     <l n="5">pageant takes place in that town at the great fair on Friday in Trinity</l>
     <l n="6">week . Earl Leofric was the Lord of Coventry in the reign of Edward the</l>
     <l n="7">Confessor , and he and his wife Godiva founded a magnificent Benedictine</l>
     <l n="8">monastery at Coventry . The first writer who mentions this legend is</l>
     <l n="9">Matthew of Westminster , who wrote in 1307 , that is some 250 years after</l>
     <l n="10">Leofric 's time , and what authority he had for it is not known . It is</l>
     <l n="11">certainly not mentioned by the many preceding writers who have left</l>
     <l n="12">accounts of Leofric and Godiva ( see Gough 's edition of Camden 's</l>
     <l n="13">‘ Britannia ’ , vol . ii ., p. 346 , and for a full account of the legend see</l>
     <l n="14">W. Reader , ‘ The History and Description of Coventry Show Fair , with the</l>

   <p>THE TWO VOICES</p>
   <p>First published in 1842 , though begun as early as 1833 and in course of composition in 1834 . See Spedding 's letter dated 19th September , 1834 . Its original title was ‘ The Thoughts of a Suicide ’ . No alterations were made in the poem after 1842 .</p>
   <p>It adds interest to this poem to know that it is autobiographical . It was written soon after the death of Arthur Hallam when Tennyson 's depression was deepest . “ When I wrote ‘ The Two Voices ’ I was so utterly miserable , a burden to myself and to my family , that I said , ‘ Is life worth anything ? ’ ” It is the history — as Spedding put it — of the agitations , the suggestions and counter-suggestions of a mind sunk in hopeless despondency , and meditating self-destruction , together with the manner of its recovery to a more healthy condition . We have two singularly interesting parallels to it in preceding poetry . The one is in the third book of Lucretius ( 830-1095 ) , where the arguments for suicide are urged , not merely by the poet himself , but by arguments placed by him in the mouth of Nature herself , and urged with such cogency that they are said to have induced one of his editors and translators , Creech , to put an end to his life . The other is in Spenser , in the dialogue between Despair and the Red Cross Knight , where Despair puts the case for self-destruction , and the Red Cross Knight rebuts the arguments ( ‘ Faerie Queene ’ , I . ix ., st . xxxviii. - liv . ) .</p>

   <p>THE DAY-DREAM</p>
   <p>First published in 1842 , but written in 1835 . In it is incorporated , though with several alterations , ‘ The Sleeping Beauty ’ , published among the poems of 1830 , but excised in subsequent editions . Half extravaganza and half apologue , like the ‘ Midsummer Night 's Dream ’ , this delightful poem may be safely left to deliver its own message and convey its own meaning . It is an excellent illustration of the truth of Tennyson 's own remark : “ Poetry is like shot silk with many glancing colours . Every reader must find his own interpretation according to his ability , and according to his sympathy with the poet . ”</p>

    <head>ST. AGNES</head>
    <head>This exquisite little poem was first published in 1837 in the ‘ Keepsake ’ , an annual edited by Lady Emmeline Stuart Wortley , and was included in the edition of 1842 . No alteration has been made in it since 1842 .</head>
    <head>In 1857 the title was altered from “ St. Agnes ” to “ St. Agnes ’ Eve , ” thus bringing it near to Keats ’ poem , which certainly influenced Tennyson in writing it , as a comparison of the opening of the two poems will show . The saint from whom the poem takes its name was a young girl of thirteen who suffered martyrdom in the reign of Diocletian : she is a companion to Sir Galahad .</head>

    <head>SIR GALAHAD</head>
    <head>Published in 1842 . No alteration has been made in it since . This poem may be regarded as a prelude to ‘ The Holy Grail ’ . The character of Galahad is deduced principally from the seventeenth book of the ‘ Morte d'Arthur ’ . In the twenty-second chapter of that book St. Joseph of Arimathea says to him : “ Thou hast resembled me in two things in that thou hast seen the marvels of the sangreal , and in that thou has been a clean maiden ” .</head>

   <p>WILL WATERPROOF 'S LYRICAL MONOLOGUE</p>
   <p>MADE AT THE COCK</p>
   <p>First published 1842 . The final text was that of 1853 , which has not been altered since , except that in stanza 29 the two “ we 's ” in the first line and the “ thy ” in the third line are not in later editions italicised . The Cock Tavern , No . 201 Fleet Street , on the north side of Fleet Street , stood opposite the Temple and was of great antiquity , going back nearly 300 years . Strype , bk . iv ., h. 117 , describes it as “ a noted public-house , ” and Pepys ’ ‘ Diary ’ , 23rd April , 1668 , speaks of himself as having been “ mighty merry there ” . The old carved chimney-piece was of the age of James I ., and the gilt bird over the portal was the work of Grinling Gibbons . When Tennyson wrote this poem it was the favourite resort of templars , journalists and literary people generally , as it had long been . But the old place is now a thing of the past . On the evening of 10th April , 1886 , it closed its doors for ever after an existence of nearly 300 years . There is an admirable description of it , signed A. J. M ., in ‘ Notes and Queries ’ , seventh series , vol . i ., 442-6 . I give a short extract :</p>
   <p>“ At the end of a long room beyond the skylight which , except a feeble side window , was its only light in the daytime , was a door that led past a small lavatory and up half a dozen narrow steps to the kitchen , one of the strangest and grimmest old kitchens you ever saw . Across a mighty hatch , thronged with dishes , you looked into it and beheld there the white-jacketed man-cook , served by his two robust and red-armed kitchen maids . For you they were preparing chops , pork chops in winter , lamb chops in spring , mutton chops always , and steaks and sausages , and kidneys and potatoes , and poached eggs and Welsh rabbits , and stewed cheese , the special glory of the house . That was the ‘ menu ’ and men were the only guests . But of late years , as innovations often precede a catastrophe , two new things were introduced , vegetables and women . Both were respectable and both were good , but it was felt , especially by the virtuous Smurthwaite , that they were ‘ de trop ’ in a place so masculine and so carnivorous . ”</p>

    <head>AFTER READING A LIFE AND LETTERS</head>
    <head>Originally published in the ‘ Examiner ’ for 24th March , 1849 ; then in the sixth edition of the poems , 1850 , with the second part of the title and the alterations noted . When reprinted in 1851 one more slight alteration was made . It has not been altered since . The work referred to was Moncton Milne 's ( afterwards Lord Houghton ) ‘ Letters and Literary Remains of Keats ’ published in 1848 , and the person to whom the poem may have been addressed was Tennyson 's brother Charles , afterwards Charles Tennyson Turner , to the facts of whose life and to whose character it would exactly apply . See Napier ,' Homes and Haunts of Tennyson ’ , 48-50 . But Sir Franklin Lushington tells me that it was most probably addressed to some imaginary person , as neither he nor such of Tennyson 's surviving friends as he kindly consulted for me are able to identify the person .</head>

    <head>LADY CLARE</head>
     <l n="1">First published 1842 . After 1851 no alterations were made .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This poem was suggested by Miss Ferrier 's powerful novel ‘ The Inheritance ’ . A comparison with the plot of Miss Ferrier 's novel will show with what tact and skill Tennyson has adapted the tale to his ballad . Thomas St. Clair , youngest son of the Earl of Rossville , marries a Miss Sarah Black , a girl of humble and obscure birth . He dies , leaving a widow and as is supposed a daughter , Gertrude , who claim the protection of Lord Rossville , as the child is heiress presumptive to the earldom . On Lord Rossville 's death she accordingly becomes Countess of Rossville . She has two lovers , both distant connections , Colonel Delmour and Edward Lyndsay . At last it is discovered that she was not the daughter of Thomas St. Clair and her supposed mother , but of one Marion La Motte and Jacob Leviston , and that Mrs. St. Clair had adopted her when a baby and passed her off as her own child , that she might succeed to the title . Meanwhile Delmour by the death of his elder brother succeeds to the title and estates forfeited by the detected foundling , but instead of acting as Tennyson 's Lord Ronald does , he repudiates her and marries a duchess . But her other lover Lyndsay is true to her and marries her . Delmour not long afterwards dies without issue , and Lyndsay succeeds to the title , Gertrude then becoming after all Countess of Rossville . In details Tennyson follows the novel sometimes very closely . Thus the “ single rose , ” the poor dress , the bitter exclamation about her being a beggar born , are from the novel .</p>

   <p>This poem tells the well-known story of Sarah Hoggins who married under the circumstances related in the poem . She died in January , 1797 , sinking , so it was said , but without any authority for such a statement , under the burden of an honour “ unto which she was not born ” . The story is that Henry Cecil , heir presumptive to his uncle , the ninth Earl of Exeter , was staying at Bolas , a rural village in Shropshire , where he met Sarah Hoggins and married her . They lived together at Bolas , where the two eldest of his children were born , for two years before he came into the title . She bore him two other children after she was Countess of Exeter , dying at Burleigh House near Stamford at the early age of twenty-four . The obituary notice runs thus : “ January , 1797 . At Burleigh House near Stamford , aged twenty-four , to the inexpressible surprise and concern of all acquainted with her , the Right Honbl . Countess of Exeter . ” For full information about this romantic incident see Walford 's ‘ Tales of Great Families ’ , first series , vol . i ., 65-82 , and two interesting papers signed W. O. Woodall in ‘ Notes and Queries ’ , seventh series , vol . xii ., 221-23 ; ‘ ibid . ’ , 281-84 , and Napier 's ‘ Homes and Haunts of Tennyson ’ , 104-111 .</p>

     <l n="1">In her ear he whispers gaily ,</l>

     <l n="21">From deep thought himself he rouses ,</l>
     <l n="22">Says to her that loves him well ,</l>
     <l n="23">“ Let us see these handsome houses</l>

     <l n="25">So she goes by him attended ,</l>

     <l n="27">Sees whatever fair and splendid</l>
     <l n="28">Lay betwixt his home and hers ;</l>
     <l n="29">Parks with oak and chestnut shady ,</l>
     <l n="30">Parks and order 'd gardens great ,</l>
     <l n="31">Ancient homes of lord and lady ,</l>
     <l n="32">Built for pleasure and for state .</l>
     <l n="33">All he shows her makes him dearer :</l>

     <l n="37">O but she will love him truly !</l>
     <l n="38">He shall have a cheerful home ;</l>
     <l n="39">She will order all things duly ,</l>
     <l n="40">When beneath his roof they come .</l>
     <l n="41">Thus her heart rejoices greatly ,</l>
     <l n="42">Till a gateway she discerns</l>
     <l n="43">With armorial bearings stately ,</l>
     <l n="44">And beneath the gate she turns ;</l>
     <l n="45">Sees a mansion more majestic</l>
     <l n="46">Than all those she saw before :</l>
     <l n="47">Many a gallant gay domestic</l>
     <l n="48">Bows before him at the door .</l>
     <l n="49">And they speak in gentle murmur ,</l>
     <l n="50">When they answer to his call ,</l>
     <l n="51">While he treads with footstep firmer ,</l>
     <l n="52">Leading on from hall to hall .</l>
     <l n="53">And , while now she wonders blindly ,</l>
     <l n="54">Nor the meaning can divine ,</l>
     <l n="55">Proudly turns he round and kindly ,</l>
     <l n="56">“ All of this is mine and thine ” .</l>
     <l n="57">Here he lives in state and bounty ,</l>
     <l n="58">Lord of Burleigh , fair and free ,</l>
     <l n="59">Not a lord in all the county</l>
     <l n="60">Is so great a lord as he .</l>
     <l n="61">All at once the colour flushes</l>
     <l n="62">Her sweet face from brow to chin :</l>
     <l n="63">As it were with shame she blushes ,</l>
     <l n="64">And her spirit changed within .</l>
     <l n="65">Then her countenance all over</l>
     <l n="66">Pale again as death did prove :</l>
     <l n="67">But he clasp 'd her like a lover ,</l>
     <l n="68">And he cheer 'd her soul with love .</l>
     <l n="69">So she strove against her weakness ,</l>
     <l n="70">Tho ’ at times her spirits sank :</l>
     <l n="71">Shaped her heart with woman 's meekness</l>
     <l n="72">To all duties of her rank :</l>
     <l n="73">And a gentle consort made he ,</l>
     <l n="74">And her gentle mind was such</l>
     <l n="75">That she grew a noble lady ,</l>
     <l n="76">And the people loved her much .</l>
     <l n="77">But a trouble weigh 'd upon her ,</l>
     <l n="78">And perplex 'd her , night and morn ,</l>
     <l n="79">With the burthen of an honour</l>
     <l n="80">Unto which she was not born .</l>
     <l n="81">Faint she grew , and ever fainter ,</l>
     <l n="82">As she murmur 'd “ Oh , that he</l>
     <l n="83">Were once more that landscape-painter</l>
     <l n="84">Which did win my heart from me ! ”</l>
     <l n="85">So she droop 'd and droop 'd before him ,</l>
     <l n="86">Fading slowly from his side :</l>
     <l n="87">Three fair children first she bore him ,</l>
     <l n="88">Then before her time she died .</l>
     <l n="89">Weeping , weeping late and early ,</l>
     <l n="90">Walking up and pacing down ,</l>
     <l n="91">Deeply mourn 'd the Lord of Burleigh ,</l>
     <l n="92">Burleigh-house by Stamford-town .</l>
     <l n="93">And he came to look upon her ,</l>
     <l n="94">And he look 'd at her and said ,</l>
     <l n="95">“ Bring the dress and put it on her ,</l>
     <l n="96">That she wore when she was wed ” .</l>
     <l n="97">Then her people , softly treading ,</l>
     <l n="98">Bore to earth her body , drest</l>
     <l n="99">In the dress that she was wed in ,</l>
     <l n="100">That her spirit might have rest .</l>

    <head>THE VISION OF SIN</head>
     <l n="1">First published in 1842 . No alteration made in it after 1851 , except in</l>
     <l n="2">the insertion of a couplet afterwards omitted .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This remarkable poem may be regarded as a sort of companion poem to ‘ The Palace of Art ’ ; the one traces the effect of callous indulgence in mere intellectual and aesthetic pleasures , the other of profligate indulgence in the grosser forms of sensual enjoyment . At first all is ecstasy and intoxication , then comes satiety , and all that satiety brings in its train , cynicism , pessimism , the drying up of the very springs of life . “ The body chilled , jaded and ruined , the cup of pleasure drained to the dregs , the senses exhausted of their power to enjoy , the spirit of its wish to aspire , nothing left but loathing , craving and rottenness . ” See Spedding in ‘ Edinburgh Review ’ for April , 1843 . The poem concludes by leaving as an answer to the awful question , “ can there be final salvation for the poor wretch ? ” a reply undecipherable by man , and dawn breaking in angry splendour . The best commentary on the poem would be Byron 's lyric : “ There 's not a joy the world can give like that it takes away , ” and ‘ Don Juan ’ ; biography and daily life are indeed full of comments on the truth of this fine allegory .</p>

     <l n="1">I had a vision when the night was late :</l>
     <l n="2">A youth came riding toward a palace-gate .</l>
     <l n="3">He rode a horse with wings , that would have flown ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></l>
     <l n="4">But that his heavy rider kept him down .</l>
     <l n="5">And from the palace came a child of sin ,</l>
     <l n="6">And took him by the curls , and led him in ,</l>
     <l n="7">Where sat a company with heated eyes ,</l>
     <l n="8">Expecting when a fountain should arise :</l>
     <l n="9">A sleepy light upon their brows and lips —</l>
     <l n="10">As when the sun , a crescent of eclipse ,</l>
     <l n="11">Dreams over lake and lawn , and isles and capes —</l>
     <l n="12">Suffused them , sitting , lying , languid shapes ,</l>
     <l n="13">By heaps of gourds , and skins of wine , and piles of grapes .</l>

   <p>“ The power of explaining such concentrated expressions of the imagination was very different from that of writing them ” .</p>
   <p>And on another occasion he said very happily :</p>
   <p>“ Poetry is like shot silk with many glancing colours . Every reader must find his own interpretation , according to his ability , and according to his sympathy with the poet ” .</p>

    <p n="2">POEMS PUBLISHED IN MDCCCXXX</p>
    <p n="3">ELEGIACS</p>
    <p n="4">Reprinted in Collected Works among ‘ Juvenilia ’ , with title altered to ‘ Leonine Elegiacs ’ . The only alterations made in the text were “ wood-dove ” for “ turtle , ” and the substitution of “ or ” for “ and ” in the last line but one .</p>
    <p n="5">Lowflowing breezes are roaming the broad valley dimm 'd in the gloaming : Thoro ’ the black-stemm 'd pines only the far river shines . Creeping thro ’ blossomy rushes and bowers of rose-blowing bushes , Down by the poplar tall rivulets babble and fall . Barketh the shepherd-dog cheerily ; the grasshopper carolleth clearly ; Deeply the turtle coos ; shrilly the owlet halloos ; Winds creep ; dews fell chilly : in her first sleep earth breathes stilly : Over the pools in the burn watergnats murmur and mourn . Sadly the far kine loweth : the glimmering water outfloweth : Twin peaks shadow 'd with pine slope to the dark hyaline . Lowthroned Hesper is stayed between the two peaks ; but the Naiad Throbbing in mild unrest holds him beneath in her breast .</p>
    <p n="6">The ancient poetess singeth , that Hesperus all things bringeth , Smoothing the wearied mind : bring me my love , Rosalind . Thou comest morning and even ; she cometh not morning or even . False-eyed Hesper , unkind , where is my sweet Rosalind ?</p>
    <p n="7">THE “ HOW ” AND THE “ WHY ”</p>
    <p n="8">I am any man 's suitor , If any will be my tutor : Some say this life is pleasant , Some think it speedeth fast : In time there is no present , In eternity no future , In eternity no past . We laugh , we cry , we are born , we die , Who will riddle me the how and the why ?</p>
    <p n="9">The bulrush nods unto its brother , The wheatears whisper to each other : What is it they say ? What do they there ? Why two and two make four ? Why round is not square ? Why the rocks stand still , and the light clouds fly ? Why the heavy oak groans , and the white willows sigh ? Why deep is not high , and high is not deep ? Whether we wake , or whether we sleep ? Whether we sleep , or whether we die ? How you are you ? Why I am I ? Who will riddle me the how and the why ?</p>
    <p n="10">The world is somewhat ; it goes on somehow ; But what is the meaning of then and now ? I feel there is something ; but how and what ? I know there is somewhat ; but what and why ? I cannot tell if that somewhat be I .</p>
    <p n="11">The little bird pipeth , “ why ? why ? ” In the summerwoods when the sun falls low And the great bird sits on the opposite bough , And stares in his face and shouts , “ how ? how ? ” And the black owl scuds down the mellow twilight , And chaunts , “ how ? how ? ” the whole of the night .</p>
    <p n="12">Why the life goes when the blood is spilt ? What the life is ? where the soul may lie ? Why a church is with a steeple built ; And a house with a chimneypot ? Who will riddle me the how and the what ? Who will riddle me the what and the why ?</p>
    <p n="13">SUPPOSED CONFESSIONS</p>
    <p n="14">OF A SECOND-RATE SENSITIVE MIND NOT IN UNITY WITH ITSELF</p>
    <p n="15">There has been only one important alteration made in this poem , when it was reprinted among the ‘ Juvenilia ’ in 1871 , and that was the suppression of the verses beginning “ A grief not uninformed and dull ” to “ Indued with immortality ” inclusive , and the substitution of “ rosy ” for “ waxen ” . Capitals are in all cases inserted in the reprint where the Deity is referred to , “ through ” is altered into “ thro ’ ” all through the poem , and hyphens are inserted in the double epithets . No further alterations were made in the edition of 1830 .</p>
    <p n="16">Oh God ! my God ! have mercy now . I faint , I fall . Men say that thou Didst die for me , for such as me , Patient of ill , and death , and scorn , And that my sin was as a thorn Among the thorns that girt thy brow , Wounding thy soul .— That even now , In this extremest misery Of ignorance , I should require A sign ! and if a bolt of fire Would rive the slumbrous summernoon While I do pray to thee alone , Think my belief would stronger grow ! Is not my human pride brought low ? The boastings of my spirit still ? The joy I had in my freewill All cold , and dead , and corpse-like grown ? And what is left to me , but thou , And faith in thee ? Men pass me by ; Christians with happy countenances — And children all seem full of thee ! And women smile with saint-like glances Like thine own mother 's when she bow 'd Above thee , on that happy morn When angels spake to men aloud , And thou and peace to earth were born . Goodwill to me as well as all — I one of them : my brothers they : Brothers in Christ — a world of peace And confidence , day after day ; And trust and hope till things should cease , And then one Heaven receive us all . How sweet to have a common faith ! To hold a common scorn of death ! And at a burial to hear The creaking cords which wound and eat Into my human heart , whene'er Earth goes to earth , with grief , not fear , With hopeful grief , were passing sweet !</p>
    <p n="17">A grief not uninformed , and dull Hearted with hope , of hope as full As is the blood with life , or night And a dark cloud with rich moonlight . To stand beside a grave , and see The red small atoms wherewith we Are built , and smile in calm , and say — “ These little moles and graves shall be Clothed on with immortality More glorious than the noon of day — All that is pass 'd into the flowers And into beasts and other men , And all the Norland whirlwind showers From open vaults , and all the sea O'er washes with sharp salts , again Shall fleet together all , and be Indued with immortality . ”</p>
    <p n="18">Thrice happy state again to be The trustful infant on the knee ! Who lets his waxen fingers play About his mother 's neck , and knows Nothing beyond his mother 's eyes . They comfort him by night and day ; They light his little life alway ; He hath no thought of coming woes ; He hath no care of life or death , Scarce outward signs of joy arise , Because the Spirit of happiness And perfect rest so inward is ; And loveth so his innocent heart , Her temple and her place of birth , Where she would ever wish to dwell , Life of the fountain there , beneath Its salient springs , and far apart , Hating to wander out on earth , Or breathe into the hollow air , Whose dullness would make visible Her subtil , warm , and golden breath , Which mixing with the infant 's blood , Fullfills him with beatitude . Oh ! sure it is a special care Of God , to fortify from doubt , To arm in proof , and guard about With triple-mailed trust , and clear Delight , the infant 's dawning year .</p>
    <p n="19">Would that my gloomed fancy were As thine , my mother , when with brows Propped on thy knees , my hands upheld In thine , I listen 'd to thy vows , For me outpour 'd in holiest prayer — For me unworthy !— and beheld Thy mild deep eyes upraised , that knew The beauty and repose of faith , And the clear spirit shining through . Oh ! wherefore do we grow awry From roots which strike so deep ? why dare Paths in the desert ? Could not I Bow myself down , where thou hast knelt , To th ’ earth — until the ice would melt Here , and I feel as thou hast felt ? What Devil had the heart to scathe Flowers thou hadst rear 'd — to brush the dew From thine own lily , when thy grave Was deep , my mother , in the clay ? Myself ? Is it thus ? Myself ? Had I So little love for thee ? But why Prevail 'd not thy pure prayers ? Why pray To one who heeds not , who can save But will not ? Great in faith , and strong Against the grief of circumstance Wert thou , and yet unheard . What if Thou pleadest still , and seest me drive Thro ’ utter dark a fullsailed skiff , Unpiloted i ’ the echoing dance Of reboant whirlwinds , stooping low Unto the death , not sunk ! I know At matins and at evensong , That thou , if thou were yet alive , In deep and daily prayers wouldst strive To reconcile me with thy God . Albeit , my hope is gray , and cold At heart , thou wouldest murmur still — “ Bring this lamb back into thy fold , My Lord , if so it be thy will ” . Wouldst tell me I must brook the rod , And chastisement of human pride ; That pride , the sin of devils , stood Betwixt me and the light of God ! That hitherto I had defied And had rejected God — that grace Would drop from his o'erbrimming love , As manna on my wilderness , If I would pray — that God would move And strike the hard hard rock , and thence , Sweet in their utmost bitterness , Would issue tears of penitence Which would keep green hope 's life . Alas ! I think that pride hath now no place Nor sojourn in me . I am void , Dark , formless , utterly destroyed .</p>
    <p n="20">Why not believe then ? Why not yet Anchor thy frailty there , where man Hath moor 'd and rested ? Ask the sea At midnight , when the crisp slope waves After a tempest , rib and fret The broadimbasèd beach , why he Slumbers not like a mountain tarn ? Wherefore his ridges are not curls And ripples of an inland mere ? Wherefore he moaneth thus , nor can Draw down into his vexed pools All that blue heaven which hues and paves The other ? I am too forlorn , Too shaken : my own weakness fools My judgment , and my spirit whirls , Moved from beneath with doubt and fear .</p>
    <p n="21">“ Yet ” said I , in my morn of youth , The unsunned freshness of my strength , When I went forth in quest of truth , “ It is man 's privilege to doubt , If so be that from doubt at length , Truth may stand forth unmoved of change , An image with profulgent brows , And perfect limbs , as from the storm Of running fires and fluid range Of lawless airs , at last stood out This excellence and solid form Of constant beauty . For the Ox Feeds in the herb , and sleeps , or fills The horned valleys all about , And hollows of the fringed hills In summerheats , with placid lows Unfearing , till his own blood flows About his hoof . And in the flocks The lamb rejoiceth in the year , And raceth freely with his fere , And answers to his mother 's calls From the flower 'd furrow . In a time , Of which he wots not , run short pains Through his warm heart ; and then , from whence He knows not , on his light there falls A shadow ; and his native slope , Where he was wont to leap and climb , Floats from his sick and filmed eyes , And something in the darkness draws His forehead earthward , and he dies . Shall man live thus , in joy and hope As a young lamb , who cannot dream , Living , but that he shall live on ? Shall we not look into the laws Of life and death , and things that seem , And things that be , and analyse Our double nature , and compare All creeds till we have found the one , If one there be ? ” Ay me ! I fear All may not doubt , but everywhere Some must clasp Idols . Yet , my God , Whom call I Idol ? Let thy dove Shadow me over , and my sins Be unremembered , and thy love Enlighten me . Oh teach me yet Somewhat before the heavy clod Weighs on me , and the busy fret Of that sharpheaded worm begins In the gross blackness underneath .</p>
    <p n="22">O weary life ! O weary death ! O spirit and heart made desolate ! O damnéd vacillating state !</p>
    <p n="23">THE BURIAL OF LOVE</p>
    <p n="24">His eyes in eclipse , Pale cold his lips , The light of his hopes unfed , Mute his tongue , His bow unstrung With the tears he hath shed , Backward drooping his graceful head ,</p>
    <p n="25">Love is dead ; His last arrow is sped ; He hath not another dart ; Go — carry him to his dark deathbed ; Bury him in the cold , cold heart — Love is dead .</p>
    <p n="26">Oh , truest love ! art thou forlorn , And unrevenged ? thy pleasant wiles Forgotten , and thine innocent joy ? Shall hollowhearted apathy , The cruellest form of perfect scorn , With languor of most hateful smiles , For ever write In the withered light Of the tearless eye , An epitaph that all may spy ? No ! sooner she herself shall die .</p>
    <p n="27">For her the showers shall not fall , Nor the round sun that shineth to all ; Her light shall into darkness change ; For her the green grass shall not spring , Nor the rivers flow , nor the sweet birds sing , Till Love have his full revenge .</p>
    <p n="28">TO —</p>
    <p n="29">Sainted Juliet ! dearest name ! If to love be life alone , Divinest Juliet , I love thee , and live ; and yet Love unreturned is like the fragrant flame Folding the slaughter of the sacrifice Offered to gods upon an altarthrone ; My heart is lighted at thine eyes , Changed into fire , and blown about with sighs .</p>
    <p n="30">SONG</p>
    <p n="31">I</p>
    <p n="32">I ’ the glooming light Of middle night So cold and white , Worn Sorrow sits by the moaning wave ; Beside her are laid Her mattock and spade , For she hath half delved her own deep grave . Alone she is there : The white clouds drizzle : her hair falls loose ; Her shoulders are bare ; Her tears are mixed with the bearded dews .</p>
    <p n="33">II</p>
    <p n="34">Death standeth by ; She will not die ; With glazed eye She looks at her grave : she cannot sleep ; Ever alone She maketh her moan : She cannot speak ; she can only weep ; For she will not hope . The thick snow falls on her flake by flake , The dull wave mourns down the slope , The world will not change , and her heart will not break .</p>

    <p n="38">Fair year , fair year , thy children call , But thou art deaf as death ; All in the bloomèd May . When thy light perisheth That from thee issueth , Our life evanisheth : Oh ! stay . Alas ! that lips so cruel-dumb Should have so sweet a breath !</p>

    <p n="45">Every day hath its night : Every night its morn : Thorough dark and bright Wingèd hours are borne ; Ah ! welaway !</p>
    <p n="46">Seasons flower and fade ; Golden calm and storm Mingle day by day . There is no bright form Doth not cast a shade — Ah ! welaway !</p>
    <p n="47">II</p>
    <p n="48">When we laugh , and our mirth Apes the happy vein , We 're so kin to earth , Pleasaunce fathers pain — Ah ! welaway ! Madness laugheth loud : Laughter bringeth tears : Eyes are worn away Till the end of fears Cometh in the shroud , Ah ! welaway !</p>
    <p n="49">III</p>
    <p n="50">All is change , woe or weal ; Joy is Sorrow 's brother ; Grief and gladness steal Symbols of each other ; Ah ! welaway ! Larks in heaven 's cope Sing : the culvers mourn All the livelong day . Be not all forlorn ; Let us weep , in hope — Ah ! welaway !</p>

    <p n="52">Reprinted without any important alteration among the ‘ Juvenilia ’ in 1871 and onward . No change made except that “ through ” is spelt “ thro ’ , ” and in the last line “ and ” is substituted for “ all ” .</p>
    <p n="53">When will the stream be aweary of flowing Under my eye ? When will the wind be aweary of blowing Over the sky ? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting ? When will the heart be aweary of beating ? And nature die ? Never , oh ! never , nothing will die ? The stream flows , The wind blows , The cloud fleets , The heart beats , Nothing will die .</p>
    <p n="54">Nothing will die ; All things will change Through eternity . ‘ Tis the world 's winter ; Autumn and summer Are gone long ago ; Earth is dry to the centre , But spring , a new comer , A spring rich and strange , Shall make the winds blow Round and round , Through and through , Here and there , Till the air And the ground Shall be filled with life anew .</p>
    <p n="55">The world was never made ; It will change , but it will not fade . So let the wind range ; For even and morn Ever will be Through eternity . Nothing was born ; Nothing will die ; All things will change .</p>
    <p n="56">ALL THINGS WILL DIE</p>
    <p n="57">Reprinted among ‘ Juvenilia ’ in 1872 and onward , without alteration .</p>
    <p n="58">Clearly the blue river chimes in its flowing Under my eye ; Warmly and broadly the south winds are blowing Over the sky . One after another the white clouds are fleeting ; Every heart this May morning in joyance is beating Full merrily ; Yet all things must die . The stream will cease to flow ; The wind will cease to blow ; The clouds will cease to fleet ; The heart will cease to beat ; For all things must die .</p>
    <p n="59">All things must die . Spring will come never more . Oh ! vanity ! Death waits at the door . See ! our friends are all forsaking The wine and the merrymaking . We are called — we must go . Laid low , very low , In the dark we must lie . The merry glees are still ; The voice of the bird Shall no more be heard , Nor the wind on the hill . Oh ! misery ! Hark ! death is calling While I speak to ye , The jaw is falling , The red cheek paling , The strong limbs failing ; Ice with the warm blood mixing ; The eyeballs fixing . Nine times goes the passing bell : Ye merry souls , farewell . The old earth Had a birth , As all men know , Long ago . And the old earth must die . So let the warm winds range , And the blue wave beat the shore ; For even and morn Ye will never see Through eternity . All things were born . Ye will come never more , For all things must die .</p>
    <p n="60">HERO TO LEANDER</p>
    <p n="61">Oh go not yet , my love , The night is dark and vast ; The white moon is hid in her heaven above , And the waves climb high and fast . Oh ! kiss me , kiss me , once again , Lest thy kiss should be the last . Oh kiss me ere we part ; Grow closer to my heart . My heart is warmer surely than the bosom of the main .</p>
    <p n="62">Oh joy ! 0 bliss of blisses ! My heart of hearts art thou . Come bathe me with thy kisses , My eyelids and my brow . Hark how the wild rain hisses , And the loud sea roars below .</p>
    <p n="63">Thy heart beats through thy rosy limbs So gladly doth it stir ; Thine eye in drops of gladness swims . I have bathed thee with the pleasant myrrh ; Thy locks are dripping balm ; Thou shalt not wander hence to-night , I 'll stay thee with my kisses . To-night the roaring brine Will rend thy golden tresses ; The ocean with the morrow light Will be both blue and calm ; And the billow will embrace thee with a kiss as soft as mine .</p>
    <p n="64">No western odours wander On the black and moaning sea , And when thou art dead , Leander , My soul must follow thee ! Oh go not yet , my love Thy voice is sweet and low ; The deep salt wave breaks in above Those marble steps below . The turretstairs are wet That lead into the sea . Leander ! go not yet . The pleasant stars have set : Oh ! go not , go not yet , Or I will follow thee .</p>
    <p n="65">THE MYSTIC</p>
    <p n="66">Angels have talked with him , and showed him thrones : Ye knew him not : he was not one of ye , Ye scorned him with an undiscerning scorn ; Ye could not read the marvel in his eye , The still serene abstraction ; he hath felt The vanities of after and before ; Albeit , his spirit and his secret heart The stern experiences of converse lives , The linked woes of many a fiery change Had purified , and chastened , and made free . Always there stood before him , night and day , Of wayward vary colored circumstance , The imperishable presences serene Colossal , without form , or sense , or sound , Dim shadows but unwaning presences Fourfaced to four corners of the sky ; And yet again , three shadows , fronting one , One forward , one respectant , three but one ; And yet again , again and evermore , For the two first were not , but only seemed , One shadow in the midst of a great light , One reflex from eternity on time , One mighty countenance of perfect calm , Awful with most invariable eyes . For him the silent congregated hours , Daughters of time , divinely tall , beneath Severe and youthful brows , with shining eyes Smiling a godlike smile ( the innocent light Of earliest youth pierced through and through with all Keen knowledges of low-embowed eld ) Upheld , and ever hold aloft the cloud Which droops low hung on either gate of life , Both birth and death ; he in the centre fixt , Saw far on each side through the grated gates Most pale and clear and lovely distances . He often lying broad awake , and yet Remaining from the body , and apart In intellect and power and will , hath heard Time flowing in the middle of the night , And all things creeping to a day of doom . How could ye know him ? Ye were yet within The narrower circle ; he had wellnigh reached The last , with which a region of white flame , Pure without heat , into a larger air Upburning , and an ether of black blue , Investeth and ingirds all other lives .</p>
    <p n="67">THE GRASSHOPPER</p>
    <p n="68">I</p>
    <p n="69">Voice of the summerwind , Joy of the summerplain , Life of the summerhours , Carol clearly , bound along . No Tithon thou as poets feign ( Shame fall ‘ em they are deaf and blind ) But an insect lithe and strong , Bowing the seeded summerflowers . Prove their falsehood and thy quarrel , Vaulting on thine airy feet . Clap thy shielded sides and carol , Carol clearly , chirrup sweet . Thou art a mailed warrior in youth and strength complete ; Armed cap-a-pie , Full fair to see ; Unknowing fear , Undreading loss , A gallant cavalier ‘ Sans peur et sans reproche , ’ In sunlight and in shadow , The Bayard of the meadow .</p>
    <p n="70">II</p>
    <p n="71">I would dwell with thee , Merry grasshopper , Thou art so glad and free , And as light as air ; Thou hast no sorrow or tears , Thou hast no compt of years , No withered immortality , But a short youth sunny and free . Carol clearly , bound along , Soon thy joy is over , A summer of loud song , And slumbers in the clover . What hast thou to do with evil In thine hour of love and revel , In thy heat of summerpride , Pushing the thick roots aside Of the singing flowered grasses , That brush thee with their silken tresses ? What hast thou to do with evil , Shooting , singing , ever springing In and out the emerald glooms , Ever leaping , ever singing , Lighting on the golden blooms ?</p>
    <p n="72">LOVE , PRIDE AND FORGETFULNESS</p>
    <p n="73">Ere yet my heart was sweet Love 's tomb , Love laboured honey busily . I was the hive and Love the bee , My heart the honey-comb . One very dark and chilly night Pride came beneath and held a light .</p>
    <p n="74">The cruel vapours went through all , Sweet Love was withered in his cell ; Pride took Love 's sweets , and by a spell , Did change them into gall ; And Memory tho ’ fed by Pride Did wax so thin on gall , Awhile she scarcely lived at all , What marvel that she died ?</p>
    <p n="75">CHORUS</p>
    <p n="76">In an unpublished drama written very early .</p>
    <p n="77">The varied earth , the moving heaven , The rapid waste of roving sea , The fountainpregnant mountains riven To shapes of wildest anarchy , By secret fire and midnight storms That wander round their windy cones , The subtle life , the countless forms Of living things , the wondrous tones Of man and beast are full of strange Astonishment and boundless change .</p>
    <p n="78">The day , the diamonded light , The echo , feeble child of sound , The heavy thunder 's griding might , The herald lightning 's starry bound , The vocal spring of bursting bloom , The naked summer 's glowing birth , The troublous autumn 's sallow gloom , The hoarhead winter paving earth With sheeny white , are full of strange Astonishment and boundless change .</p>
    <p n="79">Each sun which from the centre flings Grand music and redundant fire , The burning belts , the mighty rings , The murmurous planets ’ rolling choir , The globefilled arch that , cleaving air , Lost in its effulgence sleeps , The lawless comets as they glare , And thunder thro ’ the sapphire deeps In wayward strength , are full of strange Astonishment and boundless change .</p>
    <p n="80">LOST HOPE</p>
    <p n="81">You cast to ground the hope which once was mine , But did the while your harsh decree deplore , Embalming with sweet tears the vacant shrine , My heart , where Hope had been and was no more .</p>
    <p n="82">So on an oaken sprout A goodly acorn grew ; But winds from heaven shook the acorn out , And filled the cup with dew .</p>
    <p n="83">THE TEARS OF HEAVEN</p>
    <p n="84">Heaven weeps above the earth all night till morn , In darkness weeps , as all ashamed to weep , Because the earth hath made her state forlorn With selfwrought evils of unnumbered years , And doth the fruit of her dishonour reap . And all the day heaven gathers back her tears Into her own blue eyes so clear and deep , And showering down the glory of lightsome day , Smiles on the earth 's worn brow to win her if she may .</p>
    <p n="85">LOVE AND SORROW</p>
    <p n="86">O Maiden , fresher than the first green leaf With which the fearful springtide flecks the lea , Weep not , Almeida , that I said to thee That thou hast half my heart , for bitter grief Doth hold the other half in sovranty . Thou art my heart 's sun in love 's crystalline : Yet on both sides at once thou canst not shine : Thine is the bright side of my heart , and thine My heart 's day , but the shadow of my heart , Issue of its own substance , my heart 's night Thou canst not lighten even with ‘ thy ’ light , All powerful in beauty as thou art . Almeida , it my heart were substanceless , Then might thy rays pass thro ’ to the other side , So swiftly , that they nowhere would abide , But lose themselves in utter emptiness . Half-light , half-shadow , let my spirit sleep ; They never learnt to love who never knew to weep .</p>

   <div type="dedication">
    <p>TO A LADY SLEEPING O Thou whose fringed lids I gaze upon , Through whose dim brain the winged dreams are borne , Unroof the shrines of clearest vision , In honour of the silverflecked morn : Long hath the white wave of the virgin light Driven back the billow of the dreamful dark . Thou all unwittingly prolongest night , Though long ago listening the poised lark , With eyes dropt downward through the blue serene , Over heaven 's parapets the angels lean . SONNET Could I outwear my present state of woe With one brief winter , and indue i ’ the spring Hues of fresh youth , and mightily outgrow The wan dark coil of faded suffering — Forth in the pride of beauty issuing A sheeny snake , the light of vernal bowers , Moving his crest to all sweet plots of flowers And watered vallies where the young birds sing ; Could I thus hope my lost delights renewing , I straightly would commend the tears to creep From my charged lids ; but inwardly I weep : Some vital heat as yet my heart is wooing : This to itself hath drawn the frozen rain From my cold eyes and melted it again . SONNET Though Night hath climbed her peak of highest noon , And bitter blasts the screaming autumn whirl , All night through archways of the bridged pearl And portals of pure silver walks the moon . Wake on , my soul , nor crouch to agony , Turn cloud to light , and bitterness to joy , And dross to gold with glorious alchemy , Basing thy throne above the world 's annoy . Reign thou above the storms of sorrow and ruth That roar beneath ; unshaken peace hath won thee : So shalt thou pierce the woven glooms of truth ; So shall the blessing of the meek be on thee ; So in thine hour of dawn , the body 's youth , An honourable old shall come upon thee . SONNET Shall the hag Evil die with child of Good , Or propagate again her loathed kind , Thronging the cells of the diseased mind , Hateful with hanging cheeks , a withered brood , Though hourly pastured on the salient blood ? Oh ! that the wind which bloweth cold or heat Would shatter and o'erbear the brazen beat Of their broad vans , and in the solitude Of middle space confound them , and blow back Their wild cries down their cavernthroats , and slake With points of blastborne hail their heated eyne ! So their wan limbs no more might come between The moon and the moon 's reflex in the night ; Nor blot with floating shades the solar light . SONNET The pallid thunderstricken sigh for gain , Down an ideal stream they ever float , And sailing on Pactolus in a boat , Drown soul and sense , while wistfully they strain Weak eyes upon the glistering sands that robe The understream . The wise could he behold Cathedralled caverns of thick-ribbed gold And branching silvers of the central globe , Would marvel from so beautiful a sight How scorn and ruin , pain and hate could flow : But Hatred in a gold cave sits below , Pleached with her hair , in mail of argent light Shot into gold , a snake her forehead clips And skins the colour from her trembling lips . LOVE I Thou , from the first , unborn , undying love , Albeit we gaze not on thy glories near , Before the face of God didst breathe and move , Though night and pain and ruin and death reign here . Thou foldest , like a golden atmosphere , The very throne of the eternal God : Passing through thee the edicts of his fear Are mellowed into music , borne abroad By the loud winds , though they uprend the sea , Even from his central deeps : thine empery Is over all : thou wilt not brook eclipse ; Thou goest and returnest to His Lips Like lightning : thou dost ever brood above The silence of all hearts , unutterable Love . II To know thee is all wisdom , and old age Is but to know thee : dimly we behold thee Athwart the veils of evil which enfold thee . We beat upon our aching hearts with rage ; We cry for thee : we deem the world thy tomb . As dwellers in lone planets look upon The mighty disk of their majestic sun , Hollowed in awful chasms of wheeling gloom , Making their day dim , so we gaze on thee . Come , thou of many crowns , white-robed love , Oh ! rend the veil in twain : all men adore thee ; Heaven crieth after thee ; earth waileth for thee : Breathe on thy winged throne , and it shall move In music and in light o'er land and sea . III And now — methinks I gaze upon thee now , As on a serpent in his agonies Awestricken Indians ; what time laid low And crushing the thick fragrant reeds he lies , When the new year warm breathed on the earth , Waiting to light him with his purple skies , Calls to him by the fountain to uprise . Already with the pangs of a new birth Strain the hot spheres of his convulsed eyes , And in his writhings awful hues begin To wander down his sable sheeny sides , Like light on troubled waters : from within Anon he rusheth forth with merry din , And in him light and joy and strength abides ; And from his brows a crown of living light Looks through the thickstemmed woods by day and night . THE KRAKEN Reprinted without alteration , except in the spelling of “ antient , ” among ‘ Juvenilia ’ in 1871 and onward . Below the thunders of the upper deep ; Far , far beneath in the abysmal sea , His antient , dreamless , uninvaded sleep The Kraken sleepeth : faintest sunlights flee About his shadowy sides : above him swell Huge sponges of millennial growth and height ; And far away into the sickly light , From many a wondrous grot and secret cell Unnumber 'd and enormous polypi Winnow with giant arms the slumbering green . There hath he lain for ages and will lie Battening upon huge seaworms in his sleep , Until the latter fire shall heat the deep ; Then once by man and angels to be seen , In roaring he shall rise and on the surface die . ENGLISH WAR SONG Who fears to die ? Who fears to die ? Is there any here who fears to die He shall find what he fears , and none shall grieve For the man who fears to die ; But the withering scorn of the many shall cleave To the man who fears to die . Chorus .— Shout for England ! Ho ! for England ! George for England ! Merry England ! England for aye ! The hollow at heart shall crouch forlorn , He shall eat the bread of common scorn ; It shall be steeped in the salt , salt tear , Shall be steeped in his own salt tear : Far better , far better he never were born Than to shame merry England here . Chorus .— Shout for England ! etc . There standeth our ancient enemy ; Hark ! he shouteth — the ancient enemy ! On the ridge of the hill his banners rise ; They stream like fire in the skies ; Hold up the Lion of England on high Till it dazzle and blind his eyes . Chorus .— Shout for England ! etc . Come along ! we alone of the earth are free ; The child in our cradles is bolder than he ; For where is the heart and strength of slaves ? Oh ! where is the strength of slaves ? He is weak ! we are strong ; he a slave , we are free ; Come along ! we will dig their graves . Chorus .— Shout for England ! etc . There standeth our ancient enemy ; Will he dare to battle with the free ? Spur along ! spur amain ! charge to the fight : Charge ! charge to the fight ! Hold up the Lion of England on high ! Shout for God and our right ! Chorus. - Shout for England ! etc . NATIONAL SONG There is no land like England Where'er the light of day be ; There are no hearts like English hearts , Such hearts of oak as they be . There is no land like England Where'er the light of day be ; There are no men like Englishmen , So tall and bold as they be . Chorus . For the French the Pope may shrive ‘ em , For the devil a whit we heed ‘ em , As for the French , God speed ‘ em Unto their hearts ’ desire , And the merry devil drive ‘ em Through the water and the fire . Our glory is our freedom , We lord it o'er the sea ; We are the sons of freedom , We are free . There is no land like England , Where'er the light of day be ; There are no wives like English wives , So fair and chaste as they be . There is no land like England , Where'er the light of day be ; There are no maids like English maids , So beautiful as they be . Chorus .— For the French , etc . DUALISMS Two bees within a chrystal flowerbell rocked Hum a lovelay to the westwind at noontide . Both alike , they buzz together , Both alike , they hum together Through and through the flowered heather . Where in a creeping cove the wave unshocked Lays itself calm and wide , Over a stream two birds of glancing feather Do woo each other , carolling together . Both alike , they glide together Side by side ; Both alike , they sing together , Arching blue-glossed necks beneath the purple weather . Two children lovelier than Love , adown the lea are singing , As they gambol , lilygarlands ever stringing : Both in blosmwhite silk are frockèd : Like , unlike , they roam together Under a summervault of golden weather ; Like , unlike , they sing together Side by side , Mid May 's darling goldenlockèd , Summer 's tanling diamondeyed . WE ARE FREE Reprinted among ‘ Juvenilia ’ in 1871 and onward without alteration , except that it is printed as two stanzas . The winds , as at their hour of birth , Leaning upon the ridged sea , Breathed low around the rolling earth With mellow preludes , “ We are Free ” ; The streams through many a lilied row , Down-carolling to the crispèd sea , Low-tinkled with a bell-like flow Atween the blossoms , “ We are free ” . [ Greek : Oi Rheontes ] I All thoughts , all creeds , all dreams are true , All visions wild and strange ; Man is the measure of all truth Unto himself . All truth is change : All men do walk in sleep , and all Have faith in that they dream : For all things are as they seem to all , And all things flow like a stream . II There is no rest , no calm , no pause , Nor good nor ill , nor light nor shade , Nor essence nor eternal laws : For nothing is , but all is made . But if I dream that all these are , They are to me for that I dream ; For all things are as they seem to all , And all things flow like a stream . Argal — This very opinion is only true relatively to the flowing philosophers . ( Tennyson 's note . ) POEMS OF MDCCCXXXIII “ MINE BE THE STRENGTH OF SPIRIT ... ” Reprinted without any alteration , except that Power is spelt with a small p , among the Juvenilia in 1871 and onward . Mine be the strength of spirit , full and free , Like some broad river rushing down alone , With the selfsame impulse wherewith he was thrown From his loud fount upon the echoing lea :— Which with increasing might doth forward flee By town , and tower , and hill , and cape , and isle , And in the middle of the green salt sea Keeps his blue waters fresh for many a mile . Mine be the Power which ever to its sway Will win the wise at once , and by degrees May into uncongenial spirits flow ; Even as the great gulfstream of Florida Floats far away into the Northern Seas The lavish growths of Southern Mexico . TO — When this poem was republished among the Juvenilia in 1871 several alterations were made in it . For the first stanza was substituted the following :— My life is full of weary days , But good things have not kept aloof , Nor wander 'd into other ways : I have not lack 'd thy mild reproof , Nor golden largess of thy praise . The second began “ And now shake hands ” . In the fourth stanza for “ sudden laughters ” of the jay was substituted the felicitous “ sudden scritches , ” and the sixth and seventh stanzas were suppressed . I All good things have not kept aloof Nor wandered into other ways : I have not lacked thy mild reproof , Nor golden largess of thy praise . But life is full of weary days . II Shake hands , my friend , across the brink Of that deep grave to which I go : Shake hands once more : I cannot sink So far — far down , but I shall know Thy voice , and answer from below . III When in the darkness over me The fourhanded mole shall scrape , Plant thou no dusky cypresstree , Nor wreathe thy cap with doleful crape , But pledge me in the flowing grape . IV And when the sappy field and wood Grow green beneath the showery gray , And rugged barks begin to bud , And through damp holts newflushed with May , Ring sudden laughters of the Jay , V Then let wise Nature work her will , And on my clay her darnels grow ; Come only , when the days are still , And at my headstone whisper low , And tell me if the woodbines blow . VI If thou art blest , my mother 's smile Undimmed , if bees are on the wing : Then cease , my friend , a little while , That I may hear the throstle sing His bridal song , the boast of spring . VII Sweet as the noise in parchèd plains Of bubbling wells that fret the stones , ( If any sense in me remains ) Thy words will be : thy cheerful tones As welcome to my crumbling bones . BUONAPARTE Reprinted without any alteration among ‘ Early Sonnets ’ in 1872 , and unaltered since . He thought to quell the stubborn hearts of oak , Madman !— to chain with chains , and bind with bands That island queen who sways the floods and lands From Ind to Ind , but in fair daylight woke , When from her wooden walls , lit by sure hands , With thunders and with lightnings and with smoke , Peal after peal , the British battle broke , Lulling the brine against the Coptic sands . We taught him lowlier moods , when Elsinore Heard the war moan along the distant sea , Rocking with shatter 'd spars , with sudden fires Flamed over : at Trafalgar yet once more We taught him : late he learned humility Perforce , like those whom Gideon school 'd with briers . SONNET I Oh , Beauty , passing beauty ! sweetest Sweet ! How canst thou let me waste my youth in sighs ? I only ask to sit beside thy feet . Thou knowest I dare not look into thine eyes , Might I but kiss thy hand ! I dare not fold My arms about thee — scarcely dare to speak . And nothing seems to me so wild and bold , As with one kiss to touch thy blessed cheek . Methinks if I should kiss thee , no control Within the thrilling brain could keep afloat The subtle spirit . Even while I spoke , The bare word KISS hath made my inner soul To tremble like a lutestring , ere the note Hath melted in the silence that it broke . II Reprinted in 1872 among ‘ Early Sonnets ’ with two alterations , “ If I were loved ” for “ But were I loved , ” and “ tho ’ ” for “ though ” . But were I loved , as I desire to be , What is there in the great sphere of the earth , And range of evil between death and birth , That I should fear — if I were loved by thee ? All the inner , all the outer world of pain Clear Love would pierce and cleave , if thou wert mine , As I have heard that , somewhere in the main , Fresh water-springs come up through bitter brine . ‘ Twere joy , not fear , clasped hand in hand with thee , To wait for death — mute — careless of all ills , Apart upon a mountain , though the surge Of some new deluge from a thousand hills Flung leagues of roaring foam into the gorge Below us , as far on as eye could see . THE HESPERIDES Hesperus and his daughters three That sing about the golden tree . ( Comus ) . The Northwind fall'n , in the newstarred night Zidonian Hanno , voyaging beyond The hoary promontory of Soloë Past Thymiaterion , in calmèd bays , Between the Southern and the Western Horn , Heard neither warbling of the nightingale , Nor melody o ’ the Lybian lotusflute Blown seaward from the shore ; but from a slope That ran bloombright into the Atlantic blue , Beneath a highland leaning down a weight Of cliffs , and zoned below with cedarshade , Came voices , like the voices in a dream , Continuous , till he reached the other sea . SONG I The golden apple , the golden apple , the hallowed fruit , Guard it well , guard it warily , Singing airily , Standing about the charmèd root . Round about all is mute , As the snowfield on the mountain-peaks , As the sandfield at the mountain-foot . Crocodiles in briny creeks Sleep and stir not : all is mute . If ye sing not , if ye make false measure , We shall lose eternal pleasure , Worth eternal want of rest . Laugh not loudly : watch the treasure Of the wisdom of the West . In a corner wisdom whispers . Five and three ( Let it not be preached abroad ) make an awful mystery . For the blossom unto three-fold music bloweth ; Evermore it is born anew ; And the sap to three-fold music floweth , From the root Drawn in the dark , Up to the fruit , Creeping under the fragrant bark , Liquid gold , honeysweet thro ’ and thro ’ . Keen-eyed Sisters , singing airily , Looking warily Every way , Guard the apple night and day , Lest one from the East come and take it away . II Father Hesper , Father Hesper , watch , watch , ever and aye , Looking under silver hair with a silver eye . Father , twinkle not thy stedfast sight ; Kingdoms lapse , and climates change , and races die ; Honour comes with mystery ; Hoarded wisdom brings delight . Number , tell them over and number How many the mystic fruittree holds , Lest the redcombed dragon slumber Rolled together in purple folds . Look to him , father , lest he wink , and the golden apple be stol'n away , For his ancient heart is drunk with over-watchings night and day , Round about the hallowed fruit tree curled — Sing away , sing aloud evermore in the wind , without stop , Lest his scalèd eyelid drop , For he is older than the world . If he waken , we waken , Rapidly levelling eager eyes . If he sleep , we sleep , Dropping the eyelid over the eyes . If the golden apple be taken The world will be overwise . Five links , a golden chain , are we , Hesper , the dragon , and sisters three , Bound about the golden tree . III Father Hesper , Father Hesper , watch , watch , night and day , Lest the old wound of the world be healed , The glory unsealed , The golden apple stol'n away , And the ancient secret revealed . Look from west to east along : Father , old Himala weakens , Caucasus is bold and strong . Wandering waters unto wandering waters call ; Let them clash together , foam and fall . Out of watchings , out of wiles , Comes the bliss of secret smiles . All things are not told to all , Half-round the mantling night is drawn , Purplefringed with even and dawn . Hesper hateth Phosphor , evening hateth morn . IV Every flower and every fruit the redolent breath Of this warm seawind ripeneth , Arching the billow in his sleep ; But the landwind wandereth , Broken by the highland-steep , Two streams upon the violet deep : For the western sun and the western star , And the low west wind , breathing afar , The end of day and beginning of night Make the apple holy and bright , Holy and bright , round and full , bright and blest , Mellowed in a land of rest ; Watch it warily day and night ; All good things are in the west , Till midnoon the cool east light Is shut out by the round of the tall hillbrow ; But when the fullfaced sunset yellowly Stays on the flowering arch of the bough , The luscious fruitage clustereth mellowly , Goldenkernelled , goldencored , Sunset-ripened , above on the tree , The world is wasted with fire and sword , But the apple of gold hangs over the sea , Five links , a golden chain , are we , Hesper , the dragon , and sisters three , Daughters three , Bound about All round about The gnarled bole of the charmèd tree , The golden apple , the golden apple , the hallowed fruit , Guard it well , guard it warily , Watch it warily , Singing airily , Standing about the charmed root . ROSALIND Not reprinted till 1884 when it was unaltered , as it has remained since : but the poem appended and printed by Tennyson ( in the footnote ) has not been reprinted . My Rosalind , my Rosalind , My frolic falcon , with bright eyes , Whose free delight , from any height of rapid flight , Stoops at all game that wing the skies , My Rosalind , my Rosalind , My bright-eyed , wild-eyed falcon , whither , Careless both of wind and weather , Whither fly ye , what game spy ye , Up or down the streaming wind ? II The quick lark 's closest-carolled strains , The shadow rushing up the sea , The lightningflash atween the rain , The sunlight driving down the lea , The leaping stream , the very wind , That will not stay , upon his way , To stoop the cowslip to the plains , Is not so clear and bold and free As you , my falcon Rosalind . You care not for another 's pains , Because you are the soul of joy , Bright metal all without alloy . Life shoots and glances thro ’ your veins , And flashes off a thousand ways , Through lips and eyes in subtle rays . Your hawkeyes are keen and bright , Keen with triumph , watching still To pierce me through with pointed light ; And oftentimes they flash and glitter Like sunshine on a dancing rill , And your words are seeming-bitter , Sharp and few , but seeming-bitter From excess of swift delight . III Come down , come home , my Rosalind , My gay young hawk , my Rosalind : Too long you keep the upper skies ; Too long you roam , and wheel at will ; But we must hood your random eyes , That care not whom they kill , And your cheek , whose brilliant hue Is so sparkling fresh to view , Some red heath-flower in the dew , Touched with sunrise . We must bind And keep you fast , my Rosalind , Fast , fast , my wild-eyed Rosalind , And clip your wings , and make you love : When we have lured you from above , And that delight of frolic flight , by day or night , From North to South ; We 'll bind you fast in silken cords , And kiss away the bitter words From off your rosy mouth .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>[ Footnote 1 : Perhaps the following lines may be allowed to stand as a separate poem ; originally they made part of the text , where they were manifestly superfluous :— My Rosalind , my Rosalind , Bold , subtle , careless Rosalind , Is one of those who know no strife Of inward woe or outward fear ; To whom the slope and stream of life , The life before , the life behind , In the ear , from far and near , Chimeth musically clear . My falconhearted Rosalind , Fullsailed before a vigorous wind , Is one of those who cannot weep For others ’ woes , but overleap All the petty shocks and fears That trouble life in early years , With a flash of frolic scorn And keen delight , that never falls Away from freshness , self-upborne With such gladness , as , whenever The freshflushing springtime calls To the flooding waters cool , Young fishes , on an April morn , Up and down a rapid river , Leap the little waterfalls That sing into the pebbled pool . My happy falcon , Rosalind ; Hath daring fancies of her own , Fresh as the dawn before the day , Fresh as the early seasmell blown Through vineyards from an inland bay . My Rosalind , my Rosalind , Because no shadow on you falls Think you hearts are tennis balls To play with , wanton Rosalind ? ] SONG Who can say Why To-day To-morrow will be yesterday ? Who can tell Why to smell The violet , recalls the dewy prime Of youth and buried time ? The cause is nowhere found in rhyme . KATE Reprinted without alteration among the ‘ Juvenilia ’ in 1895 . I know her by her angry air , Her brightblack eyes , her brightblack hair , Her rapid laughters wild and shrill , As laughter of the woodpecker From the bosom of a hill . ‘ Tis Kate — she sayeth what she will ; For Kate hath an unbridled tongue , Clear as the twanging of a harp . Her heart is like a throbbing star . Kate hath a spirit ever strung Like a new bow , and bright and sharp As edges of the scymetar . Whence shall she take a fitting mate ? For Kate no common love will feel ; My woman-soldier , gallant Kate , As pure and true as blades of steel . Kate saith “ the world is void of might ” . Kate saith “ the men are gilded flies ” . Kate snaps her fingers at my vows ; Kate will not hear of lover 's sighs . I would I were an armèd knight , Far famed for wellwon enterprise , And wearing on my swarthy brows The garland of new-wreathed emprise : For in a moment I would pierce The blackest files of clanging fight , And strongly strike to left and right , In dreaming of my lady 's eyes . Oh ! Kate loves well the bold and fierce ; But none are bold enough for Kate , She cannot find a fitting mate . SONNET Written , on hearing of the outbreak of the Polish Insurrection . Blow ye the trumpet , gather from afar The hosts to battle : be not bought and sold . Arise , brave Poles , the boldest of the bold ; Break through your iron shackles — fling them far . O for those days of Piast , ere the Czar Grew to this strength among his deserts cold ; When even to Moscow 's cupolas were rolled The growing murmurs of the Polish war ! Now must your noble anger blaze out more Than when from Sobieski , clan by clan , The Moslem myriads fell , and fled before — Than when Zamoysky smote the Tartar Khan , Than earlier , when on the Baltic shore Boleslas drove the Pomeranian . POLAND Reprinted without alteration in 1872 , except the removal of italics in “ now ” among the ‘ Early Sonnets ’ . How long , O God , shall men be ridden down , And trampled under by the last and least Of men ? The heart of Poland hath not ceased To quiver , tho ’ her sacred blood doth drown The fields ; and out of every smouldering town Cries to Thee , lest brute Power be increased , Till that o'ergrown Barbarian in the East Transgress his ample bound to some new crown :— Cries to thee , “ Lord , how long shall these things be ? How long this icyhearted Muscovite Oppress the region ? ” Us , O Just and Good , Forgive , who smiled when she was torn in three ; Us , who stand now , when we should aid the right — A matter to be wept with tears of blood ! TO — Reprinted without alteration as first of the ‘ Early Sonnets ’ in 1872 ; subsequently in the twelfth line “ That tho ’ ” was substituted for “ Altho ’ , ” and the last line was altered to — “ And either lived in either 's heart and speech , ” and “ hath ” was not italicised . As when with downcast eyes we muse and brood , And ebb into a former life , or seem To lapse far back in some confused dream To states of mystical similitude ; If one but speaks or hems or stirs his chair , Ever the wonder waxeth more and more , So that we say , “ All this hath been before , All this hath been , I know not when or where ” . So , friend , when first I look 'd upon your face , Our thought gave answer each to each , so true — Opposed mirrors each reflecting each — Altho ’ I knew not in what time or place , Methought that I had often met with you , And each had lived in the other 's mind and speech . O DARLING ROOM I O darling room , my heart 's delight , Dear room , the apple of my sight , With thy two couches soft and white , There is no room so exquisite , No little room so warm and bright , Wherein to read , wherein to write . II For I the Nonnenwerth have seen , And Oberwinter 's vineyards green , Musical Lurlei ; and between The hills to Bingen have I been , Bingen in Darmstadt , where the Rhene Curves towards Mentz , a woody scene . III Yet never did there meet my sight , In any town , to left or right , A little room so exquisite , With two such couches soft and white ; Not any room so warm and bright , Wherein to read , wherein to write . TO CHRISTOPHER NORTH You did late review my lays , Crusty Christopher ; You did mingle blame and praise , Rusty Christopher . When I learnt from whom it came , I forgave you all the blame , Musty Christopher ; I could not forgive the praise , Fusty Christopher . THE SKIPPING ROPE This silly poem was first published in the edition of 1842 , and was retained unaltered till 1851 , when it was finally suppressed . Sure never yet was Antelope Could skip so lightly by , Stand off , or else my skipping-rope Will hit you in the eye . How lightly whirls the skipping-rope ! How fairy-like you fly ! Go , get you gone , you muse and mope — I hate that silly sigh . Nay , dearest , teach me how to hope , Or tell me how to die . There , take it , take my skipping-rope , And hang yourself thereby . TIMBUCTOO A POEM WHICH OBTAINED THE CHANCELLOR 'S MEDAL AT THE ‘ Cambridge Commencement ’ M. DCCCXXIX BY A. TENNYSON Of Trinity College . Printed in the Cambridge ‘ Chronicle and Journal ’ for Friday , 10th July , 1839 , and at the University Press by James Smith , among the ‘ Profusiones Academicae Praemiis annuis dignatae , et in Curiâ Cantabrigiensi Recitatae Comitiis Maximis ’ A. D. M. DCCCXXIX . Reprinted in an edition of the ‘ Cambridge Prize Poems ’ from 1813 to 1858 inclusive , by Messrs. Macmillan in 1859 , but without any alteration , except in punctuation and the substitution of small letters for capitals where the change was appropriate ; and again in 1893 in the appendix to the reprint of the ‘ Poems by Two Brothers ’ . Deep in that lion-haunted island lies A mystic city , goal of enterprise . ( Chapman . ) I stood upon the Mountain which o'erlooks The narrow seas , whose rapid interval Parts Afric from green Europe , when the Sun Had fall'n below th ’ Atlantick , and above The silent Heavens were blench 'd with faery light , Uncertain whether faery light or cloud , Flowing Southward , and the chasms of deep , deep blue Slumber 'd unfathomable , and the stars Were flooded over with clear glory and pale . I gaz 'd upon the sheeny coast beyond , There where the Giant of old Time infixed The limits of his prowess , pillars high Long time eras 'd from Earth : even as the sea When weary of wild inroad buildeth up Huge mounds whereby to stay his yeasty waves . And much I mus 'd on legends quaint and old Which whilome won the hearts of all on Earth Toward their brightness , ev'n as flame draws air ; But had their being in the heart of Man As air is th ’ life of flame : and thou wert then A center 'd glory — circled Memory , Divinest Atalantis , whom the waves Have buried deep , and thou of later name Imperial Eldorado roof 'd with gold : Shadows to which , despite all shocks of Change , All on-set of capricious Accident , Men clung with yearning Hope which would not die . As when in some great City where the walls Shake , and the streets with ghastly faces throng 'd Do utter forth a subterranean voice , Among the inner columns far retir 'd At midnight , in the lone Acropolis . Before the awful Genius of the place Kneels the pale Priestess in deep faith , the while Above her head the weak lamp dips and winks Unto the fearful summoning without : Nathless she ever clasps the marble knees , Bathes the cold hand with tears , and gazeth on Those eyes which wear no light but that wherewith Her phantasy informs them . Where are ye Thrones of the Western wave , fair Islands green ? Where are your moonlight halls , your cedarn glooms , The blossoming abysses of your hills ? Your flowering Capes and your gold-sanded bays Blown round with happy airs of odorous winds ? Where are the infinite ways which , Seraph-trod , Wound thro ’ your great Elysian solitudes , Whose lowest depths were , as with visible love , Fill 'd with Divine effulgence , circumfus 'd , Flowing between the clear and polish 'd stems , And ever circling round their emerald cones In coronals and glories , such as gird The unfading foreheads of the Saints in Heaven ? For nothing visible , they say , had birth In that blest ground but it was play 'd about With its peculiar glory . Then I rais 'd My voice and cried “ Wide Afric , doth thy Sun Lighten , thy hills enfold a City as fair As those which starr 'd the night o ’ the Elder World ? Or is the rumour of thy Timbuctoo A dream as frail as those of ancient Time ? ” A curve of whitening , flashing , ebbing light ! A rustling of white wings ! The bright descent Of a young Seraph ! and he stood beside me There on the ridge , and look 'd into my face With his unutterable , shining orbs , So that with hasty motion I did veil My vision with both hands , and saw before me Such colour 'd spots as dance athwart the eyes Of those that gaze upon the noonday Sun . Girt with a Zone of flashing gold beneath His breast , and compass 'd round about his brow With triple arch of everchanging bows , And circled with the glory of living light And alternation of all hues , he stood . “ O child of man , why muse you here alone Upon the Mountain , on the dreams of old Which fill 'd the Earth with passing loveliness , Which flung strange music on the howling winds , And odours rapt from remote Paradise ? Thy sense is clogg 'd with dull mortality , Thy spirit fetter 'd with the bond of clay : Open thine eye and see . ” I look 'd , but not Upon his face , for it was wonderful With its exceeding brightness , and the light Of the great angel mind which look 'd from out The starry glowing of his restless eyes . I felt my soul grow mighty , and my spirit With supernatural excitation bound Within me , and my mental eye grew large With such a vast circumference of thought , That in my vanity I seem 'd to stand Upon the outward verge and bound alone Of full beautitude . Each failing sense As with a momentary flash of light Grew thrillingly distinct and keen . I saw The smallest grain that dappled the dark Earth , The indistinctest atom in deep air , The Moon 's white cities , and the opal width Of her small glowing lakes , her silver heights Unvisited with dew of vagrant cloud , And the unsounded , undescended depth Of her black hollows . The clear Galaxy Shorn of its hoary lustre , wonderful , Distinct and vivid with sharp points of light Blaze within blaze , an unimagin 'd depth And harmony of planet-girded Suns And moon-encircled planets , wheel in wheel , Arch 'd the wan Sapphire . Nay , the hum of men , Or other things talking in unknown tongues , And notes of busy life in distant worlds Beat like a far wave on my anxious ear . A maze of piercing , trackless , thrilling thoughts Involving and embracing each with each Rapid as fire , inextricably link 'd , Expanding momently with every sight And sound which struck the palpitating sense , The issue of strong impulse , hurried through The riv'n rapt brain : as when in some large lake From pressure of descendant crags , which lapse Disjointed , crumbling from their parent slope At slender interval , the level calm Is ridg 'd with restless and increasing spheres Which break upon each other , each th ’ effect Of separate impulse , but more fleet and strong Than its precursor , till the eye in vain Amid the wild unrest of swimming shade Dappled with hollow and alternate rise Of interpenetrated arc , would scan Definite round . I know not if I shape These things with accurate similitude From visible objects , for but dimly now , Less vivid than a half-forgotten dream , The memory of that mental excellence Comes o'er me , and it may be I entwine The indecision of my present mind With its past clearness , yet it seems to me As even then the torrent of quick thought Absorbed me from the nature of itself With its own fleetness . Where is he that borne Adown the sloping of an arrowy stream , Could link his shallop to the fleeting edge , And muse midway with philosophic calm Upon the wondrous laws which regulate The fierceness of the bounding element ? My thoughts which long had grovell 'd in the slime Of this dull world , like dusky worms which house Beneath unshaken waters , but at once Upon some earth-awakening day of spring Do pass from gloom to glory , and aloft Winnow the purple , bearing on both sides Double display of starlit wings which burn Fanlike and fibred , with intensest bloom : E'en so my thoughts , ere while so low , now felt Unutterable buoyancy and strength To bear them upward through the trackless fields Of undefin 'd existence far and free . Then first within the South methought I saw A wilderness of spires , and chrystal pile Of rampart upon rampart , dome on dome , Illimitable range of battlement On battlement , and the Imperial height Of Canopy o'ercanopied . Behind , In diamond light , upsprung the dazzling Cones Of Pyramids , as far surpassing Earth 's As Heaven than Earth is fairer . Each aloft Upon his narrow 'd Eminence bore globes Of wheeling suns , or stars , or semblances Of either , showering circular abyss Of radiance . But the glory of the place Stood out a pillar 'd front of burnish 'd gold Interminably high , if gold it were Or metal more ethereal , and beneath Two doors of blinding brilliance , where no gaze Might rest , stood open , and the eye could scan Through length of porch and lake and boundless hall , Part of a throne of fiery flame , where from The snowy skirting of a garment hung , And glimpse of multitudes of multitudes That minister 'd around it — if I saw These things distinctly , for my human brain Stagger 'd beneath the vision , and thick night Came down upon my eyelids , and I fell . With ministering hand he rais 'd me up ; Then with a mournful and ineffable smile , Which but to look on for a moment fill 'd My eyes with irresistible sweet tears , In accents of majestic melody , Like a swol'n river 's gushings in still night Mingled with floating music , thus he spake : “ There is no mightier Spirit than I to sway The heart of man : and teach him to attain By shadowing forth the Unattainable ; And step by step to scale that mighty stair Whose landing-place is wrapt about with clouds Of glory of Heaven .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>With earliest Light of Spring , And in the glow of sallow Summertide , And in red Autumn when the winds are wild With gambols , and when full-voiced Winter roofs The headland with inviolate white snow , I play about his heart a thousand ways , Visit his eyes with visions , and his ears With harmonies of wind and wave and wood — Of winds which tell of waters , and of waters Betraying the close kisses of the wind — And win him unto me : and few there be So gross of heart who have not felt and known A higher than they see : They with dim eyes Behold me darkling . Lo ! I have given thee To understand my presence , and to feel My fullness ; I have fill 'd thy lips with power . I have rais 'd thee nigher to the Spheres of Heaven , Man 's first , last home : and thou with ravish 'd sense Listenest the lordly music flowing from Th'illimitable years . I am the Spirit , The permeating life which courseth through All th ’ intricate and labyrinthine veins Of the great vine of Fable , which , outspread With growth of shadowing leaf and clusters rare , Reacheth to every corner under Heaven , Deep-rooted in the living soil of truth : So that men 's hopes and fears take refuge in The fragrance of its complicated glooms And cool impleached twilights . Child of Man , See'st thou yon river , whose translucent wave , Forth issuing from darkness , windeth through The argent streets o ’ the City , imaging The soft inversion of her tremulous Domes . Her gardens frequent with the stately Palm , Her Pagods hung with music of sweet bells . Her obelisks of ranged Chrysolite , Minarets and towers ? Lo ! how he passeth by , And gulphs himself in sands , as not enduring To carry through the world those waves , which bore The reflex of my City in their depths . Oh City ! Oh latest Throne ! where I was rais 'd To be a mystery of loveliness Unto all eyes , the time is well nigh come When I must render up this glorious home To keen ‘ Discovery ': soon yon brilliant towers Shall darken with the waving of her wand ; Darken , and shrink and shiver into huts , Black specks amid a waste of dreary sand , Low-built , mud-wall 'd , Barbarian settlement , How chang 'd from this fair City ! ” Thus far the Spirit : Then parted Heavenward on the wing : and I Was left alone on Calpe , and the Moon Had fallen from the night , and all was dark ! [ Footnote 1 : Be ye perfect even as your Father in Heaven is perfect . ]</p>
