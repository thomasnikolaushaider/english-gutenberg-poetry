    <docTitle><titlePart>THE EPIC OF PAUL . The action of THE EPIC OF PAUL begins with that conspiracy formed at Jerusalem against the life of the apostle which in the sequel led to a prolonged suspension of his free missionary career . It embraces the incidents of his removal from Jerusalem to Cæsarea , of his imprisonment at the latter place , of his journey to Rome for trial before Cæsar , and of his final martyrdom . The design of the poem as a whole is to present , through conduct on Paul 's part and through speech from him , a living portrait of the man that he was , together with a reflex of his most central and most characteristic teaching . PROEM . Paul , the new man , retrieved from perished Saul , Unequalled good and fair , from such unfair , Such evil , orient , miracle unguessed !— Both what himself he was and what he taught — This marvel in meet words to fashion forth And make it live an image to the mind Forever , blooming in celestial youth , Were well despair to purer power than mine ; Help me Thou , Author of the miracle ! BOOK I . PLOT AND COUNTERPLOT . Paul is arraigned before the Sanhedrim at Jerusalem . He had the day preceding been murderously set upon by a Jewish mob , from whose hands he was with difficulty rescued by a Roman officer , to be held as a prisoner supposed of infamous character . While Paul is thus held , a conspiracy of desperate Jews is formed by Shimei against his life . This conspiracy is fortunately discovered and exposed by Stephen , a young nephew of the apostle , acting at the instance of his mother Rachel , Paul 's sister , and under the advice of Gamaliel , Paul 's old teacher .

     <l n="6">Shimei , with smile , or scowl , uncertain which ,</l>
     <l n="7">Hatred and pleasure both at once expressed ,</l>
     <l n="8">Pleasure of hatred gratified , with more</l>
     <l n="9">Hatred than could be wholly gratified —</l>
     <l n="10">His pristine aspect worse and worse deformed .</l>
     <l n="11">Sore vexed at heart were all the Sanhedrim</l>
     <l n="12">That now the victim of their wished despite —</l>
     <l n="13">Thrice the more hated as erst so beloved ,</l>
     <l n="14">Christian apostate the once zealot Jew !—</l>
     <l n="15">Stood there but doubtfully within their power ;</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">For , yesterday , Paul in the temple-court</l>
     <l n="18">Had with fierce violence been set upon</l>
     <l n="19">By Jews who thought the holy place profaned</l>
     <l n="20">Through his unlawful bringing thither in</l>
     <l n="21">Of gentile Greeks — had there been set upon</l>
     <l n="22">And thence dragged forth with blows that purposed death .</l>
     <l n="23">But , as when Stephen suffered , so again</l>
     <l n="24">Now intervened the Roman , and this time</l>
     <l n="25">Forbade the turbulence and rescued Paul —</l>
     <l n="26">Rescued , but double-bound his hands with chains .</l>
     <l n="27">Demanding then who was the prisoner ,</l>
     <l n="28">And what his crime , and nothing learning clear</l>
     <l n="29">Amid the hubbub loud of various charge ,</l>
     <l n="30">The Roman chiliarch was conducting Paul</l>
     <l n="31">Into the castle , by the soldiers borne —</l>
     <l n="32">Hardly so wrested from the eager hands</l>
     <l n="33">Of those enraged who thirsted for his blood ,</l>
     <l n="34">And rent the air crying , “ Away with him ! ” —</l>
     <l n="35">When calmly to his captor-savior , he</l>
     <l n="36">Addressed himself and asked , “ May I to thee</l>
     <l n="37">A few words speak ? ” “ Greek understandest thou ? ”</l>
     <l n="38">Exclaimed the Roman . “ Art thou then not he ,</l>
     <l n="39">Not that Egyptian , who but late stirred up</l>
     <l n="40">Sedition , and into the wilderness</l>
     <l n="41">Led out a company four thousand strong</l>
     <l n="42">Of the Assassins ? ” “ I a Hebrew am , ”</l>
     <l n="43">Said Paul , “ of Tarsus in Cilicia ,</l>
     <l n="44">Of no mean city citizen . Let me ,</l>
     <l n="45">I pray thee , speak unto the multitude . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="46">Permitted , Paul , upon the castle stairs</l>
     <l n="47">Standing , stretched forth his hand in manacles</l>
     <l n="48">Unto the tumult surging at his feet ,</l>
     <l n="49">And , a great silence fallen upon those waves ,</l>
     <l n="50">Spoke in the Hebrew tongue to them and said :</l>
     <l n="51">“ Brethren and fathers , my defence hear ye . ”</l>
     <l n="52">( The silence deepened at the Hebrew words . )</l>
     <l n="53">“ A Jew am I , who , though in Tarsus born ,</l>
     <l n="54">Was in this city bred and at the feet</l>
     <l n="55">Of that Gamaliel taught the ancestral law</l>
     <l n="56">With every scruple of severity ,</l>
     <l n="57">Burning in zeal for God , as now do ye .</l>
     <l n="58">And I this Way hunted unto the death ,</l>
     <l n="59">Sparing from chains and from imprisonment</l>
     <l n="60">Nor man nor woman . This will the high priest</l>
     <l n="61">Witness , and all the Jewish eldership .</l>
     <l n="62">By these commissioned , to Damascus I</l>
     <l n="63">Journeyed , that , thence even , I might hither bring</l>
     <l n="64">For punishment disciples of the Way .</l>
     <l n="65">And lo , as , journeying , nigh Damascus now</l>
     <l n="66">I drew , at noonday round about me shone</l>
     <l n="67">Suddenly a great light from heaven . To earth</l>
     <l n="68">Prostrate I fell , and heard a voice that said ,</l>
     <l n="69">‘ Saul , Saul , why art thou persecuting me ? ’</l>
     <l n="70">‘ Thou , thou — who art thou , Lord ? ’ I said . And He :</l>
     <l n="71">‘ Jesus I am , Jesus of Nazareth ,</l>
     <l n="72">Whom thou art persecuting . ’ Those with me</l>
     <l n="73">Beheld indeed the light , but to the voice</l>
     <l n="74">That spake to me were deaf . And I then said ,</l>
     <l n="75">‘ What wilt thou , Lord , that I should do ? ’ ‘ Arise , ’</l>
     <l n="76">Said He , ‘ and on into Damascus go ;</l>
     <l n="77">What thou must do shall there to thee be told . ’</l>
     <l n="78">Blind-smitten with the glory of the light ,</l>
     <l n="79">Into Damascus guided by the hand</l>
     <l n="80">I came .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="81">“ There , Ananias , a devout</l>
     <l n="82">Observer of the law , of good renown</l>
     <l n="83">With all the Hebrew Damascenes , found me .</l>
     <l n="84">I felt him , though I saw him not , as he</l>
     <l n="85">Paused standing there before me , and these words</l>
     <l n="86">Spake : ‘ Brother Saul , receive thy sight . ’ And I ,</l>
     <l n="87">That selfsame hour my sight receiving , fixed</l>
     <l n="88">My eyes on Ananias , when he said :</l>
     <l n="89">‘ The God of our forefathers hath of thee</l>
     <l n="90">Made choice His will to know and to behold</l>
     <l n="91">The Righteous One and from His mouth a voice</l>
     <l n="92">To hear . For , witness shalt thou be for Him</l>
     <l n="93">To all men of the things thou hast beheld</l>
     <l n="94">And heard . And now why lingerest thou ? Arise</l>
     <l n="95">And be baptized and wash away thy sins ,</l>
     <l n="96">Calling upon His name . ’</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="97">“ Thereafter I ,</l>
     <l n="98">Unto Jerusalem returned , and here</l>
     <l n="99">Within the temple praying , into trance</l>
     <l n="100">Passed , and beheld Him , as to me He said :</l>
     <l n="101">‘ Haste , from Jerusalem to go make speed ,</l>
     <l n="102">For witness will they not from thee receive</l>
     <l n="103">Concerning Me . ’ ‘ But , Lord , ’ said I , ‘ they know</l>
     <l n="104">Themselves how I , of all men I , imprisoned</l>
     <l n="105">And scourged from synagogue to synagogue</l>
     <l n="106">Them that on Thee believed . And when was shed</l>
     <l n="107">Thy martyr Stephen 's blood , I , also I ,</l>
     <l n="108">Stood near , consenting , and their garments kept</l>
     <l n="109">Who slew him . ’ But the Lord to me replied :</l>
     <l n="110">‘ Depart , for I will send thee forth far hence</l>
     <l n="111">In mission to the Gentiles — ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="112">To this word</l>
     <l n="113">The throng to Paul gave patient ear , but now —</l>
     <l n="114">At sign and instigation , ambushed erst</l>
     <l n="115">In waiting for the moment meet to spring ,</l>
     <l n="116">And springing pregnant from the ready wit</l>
     <l n="117">Of Shimei , when that hateful hint was heard</l>
     <l n="118">Of mission to the Gentiles through a Jew —</l>
     <l n="119">Rose an uproar of voices from the crowd ,</l>
     <l n="120">As when winds mingle sea and sky in storm .</l>
     <l n="121">“ Away with such a fellow from the earth ! ”</l>
     <l n="122">They cried ; “ it is not fit that he should live . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="123">A wild scene , for with outcry wild was mixed</l>
     <l n="124">Wild gesture ; the whole madding multitude</l>
     <l n="125">Rent off their raiment , and into the air</l>
     <l n="126">Dust flung in cloud as where a whirlwind roars .</l>
     <l n="127">Astonished stood the chiliarch at the sight ,</l>
     <l n="128">Nor doubted that some monster was the man</l>
     <l n="129">Against whom such a storm of clamor raged .</l>
     <l n="130">He bade bring Paul within the castle , there</l>
     <l n="131">Bade scourge him that he might his crime confess .</l>
     <l n="132">Already they had bound him for the thongs ,</l>
     <l n="133">When Paul to the centurion standing by</l>
     <l n="134">Said , “ Is it lawful for you then to scourge</l>
     <l n="135">A man that is a Roman — uncondemned ? ”</l>
     <l n="136">This the centurion hearing , straightway he</l>
     <l n="137">Went to the chiliarch and abrupt exclaimed :</l>
     <l n="138">“ What is it thou art on the point to do ?</l>
     <l n="139">For this man is a Roman . ” Then to Paul</l>
     <l n="140">Hastens the chiliarch and , perturbed , inquires :</l>
     <l n="141">“ Tell me , art thou a Roman ? ” “ Yea , ” said Paul .</l>
     <l n="142">Surprised , incredulous half , the chiliarch cried :</l>
     <l n="143">“ I with an ample sum that franchise bought . ”</l>
     <l n="144">“ But I , ” calmly said Paul , “ was thereto born . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="145">At that word from their prisoner , the men</l>
     <l n="146">Who ready round him stood the lash to ply</l>
     <l n="147">Instantly vanished , and the chiliarch too</l>
     <l n="148">Was panic-stricken — now in doubt no more</l>
     <l n="149">That Paul a Roman was , whom he had bound</l>
     <l n="150">For stripes , against a law greater than he ,</l>
     <l n="151">Nay , sacred as the sacred majesty</l>
     <l n="152">Itself of the Republic — ancient name</l>
     <l n="153">Disguising empire !— law forbidding stripes</l>
     <l n="154">On any flesh that Roman title owned .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="155">Paul slept , in Roman chains , the Christian 's sleep ,</l>
     <l n="156">That night , but ill at ease the chiliarch tossed</l>
     <l n="157">In troubled slumbers . He , with early morn ,</l>
     <l n="158">To council called the Jewish Sanhedrim ,</l>
     <l n="159">Set Paul unbound before them , and so sought</l>
     <l n="160">The truth to know of what on him was charged .</l>
     <l n="161">With calmly steadfast eye Paul faced his foes ,</l>
     <l n="162">But Shimei smiled in confidence of guile ;</l>
     <l n="163">Whatever the accused might seek to say ,</l>
     <l n="164">Affront should meet him and torment his pride .</l>
     <l n="165">Paul , his fixed eyes pointing his moveless aim</l>
     <l n="166">Full in the faces of the elders , said :</l>
     <l n="167">“ Brethren , in all good conscience have I lived</l>
     <l n="168">In loyalty toward God unto this day . ”</l>
     <l n="169">On such a claim from such a prisoner ,</l>
     <l n="170">Angry the high priest Ananias cried ,</l>
     <l n="171">“ Smite him upon the mouth ! ” to those near by .</l>
     <l n="172">Paul flamed in answering righteous wrath , and said ,</l>
     <l n="173">Flashing a lightning from his eyes on him :</l>
     <l n="174">“ Smite thee shall God , thou whited wall ! And thou ,</l>
     <l n="175">Sittest thou here to judge me by the law ,</l>
     <l n="176">And , the law breaking , biddest me be smitten ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="177">The bolted word had flown and found its mark ,</l>
     <l n="178">And Paul stood quivering with the stern recoil .</l>
     <l n="179">But the bystanders , tools of Shimei ,</l>
     <l n="180">In chorus of well-simulated zeal</l>
     <l n="181">Of reverence toward authority , cried out :</l>
     <l n="182">“ The high priest , then , of God revilest thou ? ”</l>
     <l n="183">Tempting the outraged man to further vent</l>
     <l n="184">Volcanic of resentment at his wrong .</l>
     <l n="185">But Paul had tutored down his rebel will ;</l>
     <l n="186">Meekly he said : “ Brethren , I did not know</l>
     <l n="187">That he the high priest was , for it is writ ,</l>
     <l n="188">‘ Of one that rules thy people speak not ill . ’ ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="189">Through such self-recollection and self-rule ,</l>
     <l n="190">Paul , master of himself once more become ,</l>
     <l n="191">Became likewise master of circumstance .</l>
     <l n="192">Marking that Pharisee and Sadducee</l>
     <l n="193">Made up the assembly , he , with prudent choice ,</l>
     <l n="194">As Pharisee to Pharisee appealed .</l>
     <l n="195">“ Brethren , ” he cried , “ a Pharisee am I ,</l>
     <l n="196">From Pharisees descended ; for the hope</l>
     <l n="197">And resurrection of the dead it is</l>

     <l n="199">Discord hereon</l>

     <l n="202">For Sadducee no resurrection owned ,</l>
     <l n="203">No angel , and no spirit ; Pharisee</l>
     <l n="204">These all confessed . A hideous clamor grew ,</l>
     <l n="205">And certain scribes , who with the Pharisees</l>

     <l n="210">A hot dissension waxing , and afraid</l>

   <p>BOOK II .</p>
   <p>PAUL AND GAMALIEL .</p>
   <p>The aged Gamaliel has his wish and enjoys a prolonged interview with the prisoner Paul in the castle where the latter is confined — young Stephen being present . The result is Gamaliel 's conversion to Christianity ; but this is followed by the old man 's peaceful death on the couch where he had been resting while he talked . So peaceful is the death that , in the darkness of the late evening , Paul and young Stephen are not aware that it has occurred .</p>

   <p>SHIMEI AND THE CHILIARCH .</p>
   <p>Paul , accompanied by young Stephen , is started at about midnight , under strong military escort , for Cæsarea . At the gate of the castle , Shimei , lurking there , is arrested , and brought before the chiliarch , Claudius Lysias by name . A conversation ensues , in which Shimei , for a time with some success , practises on the chiliarch his characteristic arts of deception . At last , the chiliarch , denouncing him for what he is , and putting him under heavy bonds to respond in person , whenever and wherever afterward commanded by the Roman authorities , dismisses him from presence , chagrined and dismayed .</p>

     <l n="15">The rattling bridle-rein , the bridle-bit</l>
     <l n="16">Champed hoary , the impatient toss of head</l>
     <l n="17">Shaking the mane disheveled , and with foam</l>
     <l n="18">Flecking the breast , the shoulder , and the flank ,</l>
     <l n="19">Eruptive snort from nostril and from lip ,</l>
     <l n="20">The ass 's long and melancholy bray ,</l>
     <l n="21">Horse 's salute of recognition neighed</l>
     <l n="22">To greet some fellow welcomed in the throng ,</l>
     <l n="23">Therewith , voices of men , scuffle of feet —</l>

     <l n="29">But Paul his peace held fast amid it all ,</l>
     <l n="30">Peace , yet a posture girded and alert ;</l>

     <l n="37">If to the keeping of his kindred not ,</l>
     <l n="38">At least to Roman care and piety ;</l>
     <l n="39">Amid the hurly-burly of the hour ,</l>
     <l n="40">No chance of speech , with any that would heed ,</l>
     <l n="41">For Jewish prisoner hurried thence by night !</l>
     <l n="42">But Paul 's reveréd friend , safe fallen asleep</l>
     <l n="43">In Jesus , beyond care or want was blest ;</l>

     <l n="45">Toward one in death so reverend great as he ,</l>

     <l n="69">To the right hand beside the open port ,</l>

   <p>BOOK IV .</p>
   <p>BY NIGHT FOR CÆSAREA .</p>
   <p>The narrative returns to Paul riding with young Stephen , under escort of Roman soldiers , toward Cæsarea . The uncle and nephew ( at sufficient remove from the cavalry before them and the infantry behind them ) after an interval of silence , engage in conversation on a subject suggested by young Stephen 's quoting against Shimei one of the imprecatory psalms . This conversation is prolonged till Antipatris is reached , from which point young Stephen comes back to Jerusalem with the returning foot-soldiers , while Paul goes on with the horse to Cæsarea .</p>

   <p>SHIMEI AND YOUNG STEPHEN .</p>
   <p>Stephen , having returned , goes at once to the chiliarch , his secret purpose being to convict Shimei of his crime , through certain evidence which he thinks he can bring to bear on the case . To the youth 's disappointment and chagrin , he is received coldly and repellently by the chiliarch now much out of humor as a sequel to his disagreeable interview with Shimei . Dismissed crestfallen to go , Stephen is suddenly confronted at the door by Shimei , at that moment arriving in obedience to a summons from the chiliarch . The mutual encounter has the effect on the chiliarch observing it , to change his attitude toward Stephen , making it favorable again . Shimei is sent to Cæsarea under suspicion ; where Felix , the governor , plans a hearing for the prisoner Paul .</p>

     <l n="28">And reason was . For Claudius Lysias</l>

     <l n="31">Besides the haughty Roman chief , had met</l>
     <l n="32">Another face more welcome scarce than his .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="33">Young Stephen 's purpose , not revealed , had been</l>
     <l n="34">To move some action against Shimei .</l>
     <l n="35">This gentle Hebrew youth inherited</l>
     <l n="36">Large measure of the wilful spirit high</l>
     <l n="37">That in the blood of all his kindred ran .</l>
     <l n="38">Of his own motion he , without advice ,</l>
     <l n="39">Nay , headstrong , in the teeth of thwart advice ,</l>
     <l n="40">Which , though he sought it not , he full well felt</l>
     <l n="41">In current counter to his wish — self-moved</l>
     <l n="42">Thus , and self-willed , Paul 's nephew had resolved</l>
     <l n="43">To try what might to him be possible —</l>
     <l n="44">By putting in the place of the accused</l>
     <l n="45">Instead of the accuser 's , that base man ,</l>
     <l n="46">His uncle 's foe — to free his uncle 's state ,</l>
     <l n="47">Once and for all , from danger and annoy</l>
     <l n="48">Due to the restless hate of Shimei .</l>
     <l n="49">The friendly chiliarch was his first resort .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="50">In one swift glance , which more was of the mind</l>
     <l n="51">Itself , perceiving as it were without</l>
     <l n="52">Organ , than of the eye with which it saw ,</l>
     <l n="53">Stephen that night , upon the point of time</l>
     <l n="54">When Shimei was arrested and brought in ,</l>
     <l n="55">A glimpse had caught of two receding forms</l>
     <l n="56">Of men upon the street , flying as seemed ;</l>
     <l n="57">Whom instantly he knew to be the same</l>
     <l n="58">With that pair of conspirators to slay ,</l>
     <l n="59">Whose whispers had revealed their plot to him :</l>
     <l n="60">These were the stout young fellows Shimei set</l>
     <l n="61">To lie in wait for the escaping Paul .</l>
     <l n="62">The moment they beheld their master seized ,</l>
     <l n="63">They quickly had betaken them to flight ;</l>
     <l n="64">But Stephen 's mind flew faster than their feet ,</l>
     <l n="65">And with intangible tether had them bound .</l>
     <l n="66">This his new observation of the twain</l>
     <l n="67">Made him secure of recognizing them</l>
     <l n="68">Whenever or wherever seen again .</l>
     <l n="69">With so much clue as this , no more , in hand ,</l>
     <l n="70">To guide him in the quest of testimony</l>
     <l n="71">That might his crimes bring home to Shimei —</l>
     <l n="72">Supposed still safe in keeping at the fort —</l>
     <l n="73">Stephen his audience with the chiliarch sought .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="74">The bright hope that he brought in coming , sprung</l>
     <l n="75">From grateful recollection of the grace</l>

     <l n="77">Was promptly damped to deep dejection now .</l>
     <l n="78">The chiliarch met him with a cold and sour</l>
     <l n="79">Severity of aspect that repelled ,</l>
     <l n="80">Beyond the youth 's capacity — unbuoyed ,</l>
     <l n="81">For this occasion , with approving sense</l>
     <l n="82">Of well-advised attempt at least , if vain —</l>
     <l n="83">To front it with unruffled brow . Abashed</l>
     <l n="84">He stood , confused ; the blood rushed to his face ;</l>
     <l n="85">His tongue clung to his mouth 's roof ; and in all</l>
     <l n="86">He less looked like that youthful innocence</l>
     <l n="87">Which won the Roman so in his soft mood ,</l>
     <l n="88">Than like the conscious guilt , uncovered now ,</l>
     <l n="89">In Shimei 's slant insinuation shown .</l>
     <l n="90">The chiliarch by reaction was relapsed</l>
     <l n="91">Into his sternest temper of disdain</l>
     <l n="92">Embittered by suspicious cynicism ;</l>
     <l n="93">Apt sequel of the interview prolonged</l>
     <l n="94">With Shimei , and the final passionate</l>
     <l n="95">Ejection of that Hebrew from the fort .</l>
     <l n="96">He now awaiting Shimei , summoned back</l>
     <l n="97">Once more , to be to Cæsarea sent ,</l>
     <l n="98">Here was that Stephen — despicable he</l>
     <l n="99">Too , doubtless , like his despicable race !</l>
     <l n="100">Such was the prompt involuntary set ,</l>
     <l n="101">Inhospitable , of the chiliarch 's thought ,</l>
     <l n="102">For welcome of the youth before him there .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="103">To Stephen 's stammering words about those men ,</l>
     <l n="104">And how they might be made to testify</l>
     <l n="105">Of Shimei 's desperate plot to murder Paul ,</l>
     <l n="106">Thus bringing Shimei to deservéd doom ,</l>
     <l n="107">The Roman tartly said : “ Aye , aye , young sir ,</l>
     <l n="108">I think it like , seems altogether like .</l>
     <l n="109">You Jews could , all of you , I doubt not , swear</l>
     <l n="110">Of one another , brethren as ye be ,</l>
     <l n="111">Things damnable enough to crucify</l>
     <l n="112">Ye all , and , what is more , for just that once ,</l>
     <l n="113">Swear true ! But thanks , lad , I have had my fill</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="115">The manner was dismissory , more even</l>
     <l n="116">Than were the words , and Stephen bowed to go .</l>

     <l n="118">Although he spoke not , to such dignity ,</l>
     <l n="119">Recovered from his discomposure late ,</l>

   <p>BOOK VI .</p>
   <p>PAUL BEFORE FELIX .</p>
   <p>Paul discourses solemnly before Felix and his queen Drusilla , treating the topics of righteousness , self-control , and impending judgment . The effect is to make Felix show visible signs of discomposure on his judgment-seat . Drusilla , apprehensive of consequences disastrous to herself from her wicked husband 's awakened remorse and fear , invokes the intervention of Simon , that Cyprian Jewish sorcerer who had at first been instrumental in bringing the guilty pair together . Simon plays upon the superstition of Felix with his pretended magic arts .</p>

     <l n="67">Paul fixed his gaze point-blank on Felix while</l>

     <l n="77">Or refuge through the universe of God .</l>
     <l n="78">Paul 's vision was so vivid that his eyes</l>

     <l n="81">He stared and listened , with that thought intense</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="84">A sense of insecurity in power ,</l>

     <l n="469">Meanwhile , of all the lingerers on the deck</l>
     <l n="470">Amid that darkness , only two remained .</l>
     <l n="471">These , as they might , watched him now bending there</l>
     <l n="472">In wistful gaze over the vessel 's side</l>
     <l n="473">Downward into the waters weird below :</l>
     <l n="474">Stephen was one ; the other , Shimei .</l>
     <l n="475">But Shimei had crept later on the deck ,</l>
     <l n="476">When the increasing dark veiled all from view</l>
     <l n="477">Save what was moving or what stood upright ;</l>
     <l n="478">So he knew not of Stephen now reclined ,</l>
     <l n="479">Motionless in a trance of pleasant dream ,</l>
     <l n="480">There where Eunicé left him , when she too</l>
     <l n="481">With Rachel from the open night retired .</l>
     <l n="482">The youth had lapped him in a happy muse</l>
     <l n="483">Of memory of the things they twain that eve</l>
     <l n="484">Had shared in converse ; it was like twilight</l>
     <l n="485">Prolonging softer the full light of day .</l>
     <l n="486">Shimei thought darkly : ‘ Could yon leaning form</l>
     <l n="487">Lean farther , and embrace indeed the wave</l>
     <l n="488">He yearns toward , this enticing murky night !</l>
     <l n="489">There were redemption ready-wrought for me —</l>
     <l n="490">Who might be spared , forsooth , accusing whom</l>
     <l n="491">His own forestalling conscience had condemned ,</l>
     <l n="492">( So it should look ! ) and forced him on to die .</l>
     <l n="493">“ Vengeance is mine and recompense , ” as saith</l>
     <l n="494">Our Moses , hinting of a moment when</l>
     <l n="495">“ Their foot shall slide . ” Ha ! Ha ! It fits the case !</l>
     <l n="496">“ Their foot shall slide ! ” Feet may be brought to slide !</l>
     <l n="497">The deck is slippery with the spray ; a tip</l>
     <l n="498">Forward above , with a trip backward , so ,</l>
     <l n="499">From underneath ’ — and Shimei acted out</l>
     <l n="500">In pantomimic gesture his quick thought ;</l>
     <l n="501">‘ An accidental movement , were it seen ,</l>
     <l n="502">But it would not be seen . A fine dark night ,</l>
     <l n="503">No moon , no stars , and the whole hollow sky</l>
     <l n="504">Ink-black with clouds that when ere long they break</l>
     <l n="505">Will spit ink-rain into an inky sea !</l>
     <l n="506">Finger of God ! It were impiety</l>
     <l n="507">Not to obey a pointing such as this . ’</l>
     <l n="508">His propense thought plunged him a step toward Paul .</l>
     <l n="509">Stephen hereon , stretched out upon the deck ,</l>
     <l n="510">Marking the sinister action of the man</l>
     <l n="511">Shadowed upon the dark , a denser dark ,</l>
     <l n="512">Noiselessly gathered up his members all ,</l>
     <l n="513">Ready to rush at need to rescue , yet</l>
     <l n="514">Reserved , alert , to watch and to await ,</l>
     <l n="515">Like leopard couchant tense in poise to spring .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="516">That instant , a new dimness in the dark ,</l>
     <l n="517">A swimming outline , figure of a man</l>

     <l n="519">Hinted , no more , amid the rising wind .</l>
     <l n="520">This Stephen knew , and Shimei , both at once .</l>
     <l n="521">Shimei recoiled ; he thought , ‘ Well paused for me !</l>
     <l n="522">I might have been detected , after all ! ’</l>
     <l n="523">Then , gliding toward that shadowy moving form ,</l>
     <l n="524">He met — a Roman soldier , front to front ,</l>
     <l n="525">Nigh Stephen where he lay in ambuscade</l>
     <l n="526">Unpurposed , but now vigilant all ear</l>

     <l n="529">In altered phase persistent still the same .</l>
     <l n="530">The desperate fancy seized him to essay</l>
     <l n="531">Corrupting that custodian of Paul .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="532">A helpless fixed fatuity of hate ,</l>
     <l n="533">A dull insistent prodding from despair ,</l>

     <l n="535">He could warp wisely toward an end unwise .</l>
     <l n="536">Suspected by the Roman , by the Jew</l>
     <l n="537">No longer trusted as of old — since seen ,</l>

     <l n="539">So from his pristine ardor in pursuit</l>
     <l n="540">Of Paul — Shimei saw nothing now before</l>
     <l n="541">Him in the future but the nearing close</l>

     <l n="543">Of the strait way wherein perforce he walked .</l>
     <l n="544">One gleam of light , of possible light , ahead ,</l>
     <l n="545">He now descried . If Paul could somehow be</l>
     <l n="546">Utterly cancelled from his case , no Paul</l>
     <l n="547">Anywhere longer in the world , and if ,</l>
     <l n="548">Ah , if , O rapture ! Paul could disappear</l>
     <l n="549">Confessing guilt by seeming suicide —</l>
     <l n="550">That were the one deliverance left to hope ,</l>
     <l n="551">Hope if forlorn , at least , at least , a hope .</l>
     <l n="552">Shimei his foot set softly in the snare .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="553">With slow and sly ambages of approach ,</l>

     <l n="556">Close at his feet , but guarded from their touch</l>
     <l n="557">By a low heap of cordage coiled between ,</l>
     <l n="558">There Stephen lay the while , a breathless corpse ,</l>
     <l n="559">And listened — with his body and his mind</l>
     <l n="560">Both utterly all organ to attend —</l>
     <l n="561">As Shimei with that shifty cunning his ,</l>
     <l n="562">Insidious , like the entrance of disease ,</l>
     <l n="563">Wormed him into the bosom of his man ,</l>
     <l n="564">Instilling the temptation , sweet with bribe ,</l>
     <l n="565">To make away with his Jew prisoner .</l>
     <l n="566">It would but give the wretch 's wish effect —</l>
     <l n="567">So Shimei glozed with subtle speciousness —</l>

     <l n="569">To end the endless waverings of a mind</l>
     <l n="570">On self-destruction bent , a suicide</l>
     <l n="571">Who only lacked the courage of despair ,</l>
     <l n="572">By tossing Paul headforemost overboard .</l>
     <l n="573">Three points thereby were gained , and nothing lost :</l>

     <l n="578">“ Thou knowest , ” the tempter said , “ the feel of gold ,</l>
     <l n="579">The weight , ” and therewith thrust some pieces broad</l>
     <l n="580">Into the soldier 's hand , the antepast</l>
     <l n="581">And warrant of a ready rich reward .</l>
     <l n="582">If question should arise involving him ,</l>

     <l n="592">In force and quickness , to be so forestalled .</l>
     <l n="593">The fates and furies buoyed him overboard</l>
     <l n="594">And plumped him to the bottom of the deep .</l>
     <l n="595">Then , were his single witness held in doubt ,</l>

   <p>BOOK VIII .</p>
   <p>SHIMEI BEFORE JULIUS .</p>
   <p>The centurion Julius , having in charge the prisoners on board including Paul , examines Shimei , accused of his crime by the sentinel whom the crafty Hebrew had sought to bribe . Shimei makes a desperate effort to clear himself by bringing a countercharge against Paul of the same murderous attempt through bribe upon his , Shimei 's , life . Almost on the point of succeeding , he is confronted first with Felix , then with Stephen , last with Paul — to his complete undoing .</p>

     <l n="1">The waking dreams of Shimei , in his chains</l>

     <l n="3">Foreshadowed by the soldier bitterly</l>
     <l n="4">To him — dreams of foreboding and despair</l>
     <l n="5">Only ; that Roman had not learned that Jew .</l>
     <l n="6">The touch and prick of uttermost dismay</l>
     <l n="7">Stung him to one more struggle for himself .</l>
     <l n="8">Ere Julius , with the morning , had him forth</l>
     <l n="9">To inquest from his dungeon , that quick brain</l>
     <l n="10">Had ripe and ready , conjured up in thought ,</l>
     <l n="11">For self-defense , with snare involved for Paul ,</l>
     <l n="12">A desperate last compacture of deceit ;</l>
     <l n="13">Desperate , yet deftly woven , and staggering ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="16">“ What sayest thou , Jew , ” with challenge lowering stern ,</l>
     <l n="17">Asked the centurion of his prisoner ,</l>
     <l n="18">“ In answer to the charge against thee laid ? ”</l>
     <l n="19">“ What say ? ” with shrug of shoulder Shimei said ;</l>
     <l n="20">“ Why , that thy soldier was too strong for me ,</l>
     <l n="21">And haled me and bestowed me as he would ,</l>
     <l n="22">While at his leisure then his tale he told ,</l>
     <l n="23">Forestalling mine , to prepossess thine ear .</l>

     <l n="25">“ Worse than in vain such words as those thou speakest .</l>

     <l n="29">Where Roman justice undertakes , for one</l>

     <l n="31">True judge 's ear cannot be ‘ prepossessed . ’</l>
     <l n="32">Even now , deserving , as thou art , to be</l>

     <l n="39">Will it be insolence , if I inquire</l>
     <l n="40">What is the crime that I am charged withal ? ”</l>
     <l n="41">Curtly the Roman said : “ Attempt to bribe</l>
     <l n="42">A soldier , and a Roman soldier he ,</l>
     <l n="43">To break his oath and be a murderer . ”</l>
     <l n="44">“ No stint of generous measure to the charge , ”</l>

     <l n="49">Had I been first ; and first I should have been ,</l>

     <l n="51">Thence the duress — outrageous act from him ,</l>
     <l n="52">Lese-majesty committed against thee !—</l>

     <l n="172">Yet him I can forgive , for less as bribed</l>
     <l n="173">He faltered , than as overcome he fell .</l>
     <l n="174">Paul is the master of an evil art</l>

     <l n="187">Thus I account for it , that , without blame</l>
     <l n="188">So much to him himself , he being deceived ,</l>

   <p>BOOK IX .</p>
   <p>PAUL AND YOUNG STEPHEN .</p>
   <p>In sequel of the tragic crime and doom that had just been witnessed by him in the case of Shimei , young Stephen is drawn to resume with his kinsman Paul the topic of the imprecatory psalms , which they had previously discussed on their night ride from Jerusalem toward Cæsarea . Paul gently lets his nephew unbosom all his heart , and , point by point , meets the young man 's difficulties with senior counsel and instruction .</p>

   <p>RE-EMBARKED .</p>
   <p>Arrived at Myra on their way toward Rome , Paul and his companions are transferred to a different vessel to pursue their voyage . The new vessel is from Alexandria : it brings thence as passengers for Rome two mutual friends , one of them a Roman , the other a Buddhist from India named Krishna . Rachel , having seen Paul and the Roman greet each other as old acquaintances , soon inquires apart of Paul who the Roman is , and , learning is thence drawn on into exchange of reminiscence and reflection with her brother . The two at length unite in interceding with Julius on behalf of Shimei . They secure for him the freedom of the deck .</p>

     <l n="1">A parable in life of perfect love</l>
     <l n="2">( Other than was in heaven to be beheld ) ,</l>
     <l n="3">The clustering angels , crowded nigh to see ,</l>
     <l n="4">Saw in the things that then and there befell .</l>
     <l n="5">It might indeed have been a scene let down</l>
     <l n="6">Suddenly from above in lively show</l>
     <l n="7">Of love in act on earth like love in heaven —</l>
     <l n="8">Only that never in heaven is need of act ,</l>
     <l n="9">From love , of mercy such as now was seen ,</l>
     <l n="10">A living picture , on that vessel 's deck !</l>

     <l n="11">Luke the physician , at a sign from Paul ,</l>
     <l n="12">With Aristarchus , one on either side ,</l>
     <l n="13">Supported Shimei , tottering as he went</l>
     <l n="14">( Too weak to wish or will or this or that ,</l>
     <l n="15">Or otherwise behave than just submit ) ,</l>
     <l n="16">To where with feat celerity meanwhile</l>
     <l n="17">The women , of one mind , Rachel and Ruth</l>
     <l n="18">And fair Eunicé , in a sheltered place</l>
     <l n="19">Had spread , of rug and pillow thither brought ,</l>
     <l n="20">A sudden couch whereon a man might rest .</l>
     <l n="21">Stephen , from out the store of frugal cheer</l>
     <l n="22">By his forecasting mother 's care purveyed —</l>
     <l n="23">Provision for the needs that might attend</l>
     <l n="24">The chances of sea-faring — brought and broached</l>
     <l n="25">A flagon of sweet wine . This , to the lips</l>
     <l n="26">Of Shimei in a slender goblet pressed ,</l>
     <l n="27">Cheered him his heart and made him seem to live .</l>
     <l n="28">All was in silence done , and then , withdrawn</l>
     <l n="29">A little from about the man supine ,</l>
     <l n="30">That company of ministrants , one will —</l>
     <l n="31">Among them Mary Magdalené too ,</l>
     <l n="32">Pathetic , with her deep-experienced eyes —</l>
     <l n="33">Kept quiet watch and wished that he might sleep .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="34">And Shimei slept ; a deep dissolving sleep —</l>
     <l n="35">Unjointed all his members in remiss</l>
     <l n="36">Solution of the consciousness of life .</l>
     <l n="37">A long deep sleep ; a dreamless sleep at first ,</l>
     <l n="38">Then , as the hours wore on and still he slept ,</l>
     <l n="39">Delicious reminiscences in dream</l>
     <l n="40">( Unconscious hoarded treasure of the brain ,)</l>
     <l n="41">Were loosed within him of a dewy dawn</l>
     <l n="42">Forgotten , and a time when he was young .</l>
     <l n="43">He had found the fountain in that land of dream ,</l>
     <l n="44">And drunk his fill from it with sweet delight ,</l>
     <l n="45">Famed for its virtue to renew in youth .</l>
     <l n="46">The old man was a boy again , at home ,</l>
     <l n="47">A Hebrew home though on an alien shore .</l>
     <l n="48">Perhaps some soft insinuation crept</l>
     <l n="49">Into his sleep from that last waking sense</l>
     <l n="50">Of his , the sense , to him unwonted long —</l>
     <l n="51">A lonely man , of wife , of child , bereft ,</l>
     <l n="52">Who never sister 's gentleness had known —</l>
     <l n="53">Of touch from woman 's hand ; however it was ,</l>
     <l n="54">Shimei a vision of his mother had .</l>
     <l n="55">A son , her only , by his mother 's knee ,</l>
     <l n="56">That mother 's blossoming hope , her joy , her pride ,</l>
     <l n="57">He felt the benediction of a hand ,</l>
     <l n="58">Her hand , laid like a softness on his brow ;</l>
     <l n="59">And Shimei 's lips , no longer thin and cold ,</l>
     <l n="60">But warm now , and with flush of lifeblood full ,</l>
     <l n="61">Moved in responsive welcome of a kiss ,</l>
     <l n="62">Her kiss , and holy , like a touch of chrism .</l>
     <l n="63">How fair the vision was that then he saw !</l>
     <l n="64">How sweet the tones were that once more he heard !</l>
     <l n="65">Such sound , such sight , were better than sweet sleep ;</l>
     <l n="66">And the fond sleeper fain would wake , to dream</l>
     <l n="67">So good a dream awake , and to the full</l>
     <l n="68">Taste it , with senses and with soul nowise</l>
     <l n="69">Bound from the right fruition of their feast .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="70">So , as of his own motion , Shimei woke —</l>
     <l n="71">And instantly was sorry for the change .</l>
     <l n="72">His eyes he dared not open to the day ,</l>
     <l n="73">Holding them shut to hold himself asleep .</l>
     <l n="74">Alas , in vain ! Too late ! Full well he knew</l>
     <l n="75">Now what he was , and where , and that in truth</l>
     <l n="76">His happy boyhood had come back in dream .</l>
     <l n="77">Yet lay he lapped in luxury of pain</l>
     <l n="78">And pathos , and sweet pity of himself ,</l>
     <l n="79">And longings toward a past beyond recall ,</l>
     <l n="80">With something also of a good remorse</l>
     <l n="81">That he was such as then he felt he was ,</l>
     <l n="82">Poor broken worldling , empty heart , and old</l>
     <l n="83">( In contrast of his visionary youth ! ) ,</l>
     <l n="84">Therewith perhaps some upward-groping wish</l>
     <l n="85">That he were other . All-undoing stress</l>
     <l n="86">It was , of elemental motions blind</l>
     <l n="87">About the bases of his being bowed</l>
     <l n="88">Like Samson , and his state was overthrown .</l>
     <l n="89">Those agéd eyes that had been used to glint</l>
     <l n="90">Metallic lusters , or of adamant ,</l>
     <l n="91">Softened beneath the lids , unseen , and tears</l>
     <l n="92">Forced themselves forth down either temple falling .</l>
     <l n="93">Instinctively he stirred , and with his hands</l>
     <l n="94">( Vainly , encumbered with their manacles ! )</l>
     <l n="95">He sought to brush those trickling tears away .</l>
     <l n="96">They wandered down to mingle with his hair ,</l>
     <l n="97">Long locks , and thin , of iron grey , unkempt ,</l>
     <l n="98">Close clinging to the sunken temple walls .</l>
     <l n="99">Rachel with Ruth remarked the motions vain ,</l>
     <l n="100">And gently , without word , moved to his side .</l>
     <l n="101">There Rachel with her kerchief wiped the tears</l>
     <l n="102">With strokes as of caress , so loving light ;</l>
     <l n="103">But Ruth , observing for a moment , turned</l>
     <l n="104">With token to Eunicé , quick of heart</l>
     <l n="105">To understand , who hastening lightly thence</l>
     <l n="106">A laver full of water brought , wherefrom</l>
     <l n="107">The mother washed the forehead and the face ,</l>
     <l n="108">As had that agéd man her father been ,</l>
     <l n="109">Then dried them with a towel clean and sweet .</l>
     <l n="110">Not once the while would Shimei lift the lids</l>
     <l n="111">That trembled shutting over his dim eyes :</l>
     <l n="112">Strange new emotion made him shrink from seeing —</l>
     <l n="113">Shame , and a tenderness of gratitude ,</l>
     <l n="114">And love , that , with wing-footed Memory ,</l>
     <l n="115">Ran backward to his boyhood and there fell</l>
     <l n="116">With tears and kisses on his mother 's neck —</l>
     <l n="117">Remembered , she , a woman — such as these !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="118">The squalid wretchedness of his estate</l>
     <l n="119">Forgotten , and its utter hopelessness ,</l>
     <l n="120">Was it not blesséd , only thus to lie</l>
     <l n="121">Ministered to as if he were beloved</l>
     <l n="122">Of some one , he who long had no one loved !</l>
     <l n="123">Melted like wax within him was his heart ,</l>
     <l n="124">And when at length they spoke to him , and said ,</l>
     <l n="125">“ Thy hands too , if we might too wash thy hands ! ”</l>
     <l n="126">And when , he neither yes nor no with word</l>
     <l n="127">Or sign replying , they , with yes assumed ,</l>
     <l n="128">Did it , assuaging with all healing heed</l>
     <l n="129">The hurts and bruises of the chafing chains ,</l>
     <l n="130">Then the old man with a convulsive wrench</l>
     <l n="131">Turned his whole frame averse from them to hide</l>
     <l n="132">The tears that streamed in rivers from his eyes .</l>
     <l n="133">“ And this they do for love of their Lord Christ ! ” —</l>
     <l n="134">Such muffled words , sobbed out amid his tears</l>
     <l n="135">And shaken with the throbs that shook his frame ,</l>
     <l n="136">Those women seemed to hear from Shimei 's lips .</l>
     <l n="137">“ Lo , Jesus , wilt thou master also me ?</l>
     <l n="138">I cannot bear the pressure of this love !</l>
     <l n="139">Crushed am I under it into the babe</l>
     <l n="140">Indeed I dreamed just now I was become ! ”</l>
     <l n="141">So Shimei to himself , in words more clear</l>
     <l n="142">With the abating passion of his sobs ,</l>
     <l n="143">Spoke plaintive with the accents of a child .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="144">A start of tears responsive orbed the eyes</l>
     <l n="145">Of Ruth and Rachel at such token shown</l>
     <l n="146">Of gracious change in Shimei ; grateful tears</l>
     <l n="147">They were , and hopeful , and each tear a prayer —</l>
     <l n="148">How prevalent , who knows ?— for Shimei .</l>
     <l n="149">God , in His lachrymary urn reserved</l>
     <l n="150">To long remembrance , treasures up such tears !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="151">Paul , at remove with Stephen , beholding all ,</l>
     <l n="152">Felt a great pang and passion of desire</l>
     <l n="153">To bear some part and render a testimony</l>
     <l n="154">Of love and of forgiveness toward this man ,</l>
     <l n="155">Yea , of sweet will to be forgiven and loved</l>
     <l n="156">By him in turn , that Shimei needs must trust .</l>
     <l n="157">He thought of how the Lord , that extreme night</l>
     <l n="158">In which He was betrayed , He knowing well</l>
     <l n="159">The Father had given all things into His hands ,</l>
     <l n="160">And He was come from God and went to God ,</l>
     <l n="161">Rose from the supper , disarrayed Himself —</l>
     <l n="162">As if so laying His majesty aside</l>
     <l n="163">To clothe Himself in mightier majesty</l>
     <l n="164">Of meekness , with the servant 's towel girded !—</l>
     <l n="165">Then , pouring water in the basin , kneeled ,</l>
     <l n="166">Girded in fashion as a menial , kneeled .</l>
     <l n="167">The Lord Himself of life and glory kneeled ,</l>
     <l n="168">Washing and wiping his disciples ’ feet !</l>
     <l n="169">And Judas , Paul remembered , was among them !</l>
     <l n="170">“ This is my time , ” said he , “ my time at last ;</l>
     <l n="171">Shimei will not resist nor say me nay ,</l>
     <l n="172">And I , with mine own hands , will wash his feet . ”</l>
     <l n="173">But Stephen said : “ Lo , I have hated him</l>
     <l n="174">More wickedly than any , I beseech</l>
     <l n="175">Mine uncle let me do this thing to him .</l>
     <l n="176">Shimei will know I do it for thy sake ,</l>
     <l n="177">And it will be to him as if thou didst it . ”</l>
     <l n="178">So , Paul allowing it for his nephew 's sake ,</l>
     <l n="179">Glad to confirm him in that gentleness ,</l>
     <l n="180">Stephen a ewer of water made haste to bring ,</l>
     <l n="181">And there amid them all admiring him</l>
     <l n="182">Known to have hated Shimei so , he stooped ,</l>
     <l n="183">With a most beautiful behavior stooped —</l>
     <l n="184">Not without qualms of lothness overcome ,</l>
     <l n="185">Considering he how swift those feet had been ,</l>
     <l n="186">How swift those agéd feet , how long , had been ,</l>
     <l n="187">To shed blood , and what blood to shed how swift !—</l>
     <l n="188">And dutifully washed and wiped them clean .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="189">The old man now lay utterly relapsed ,</l>
     <l n="190">Exhausted his capacity to feel ,</l>
     <l n="191">Resistance therefore , and even reaction , none ,</l>
     <l n="192">A state suspended between life and death ;</l>
     <l n="193">So had the vehemence of his passion wrought</l>
     <l n="194">On Shimei 's weakness to disable him .</l>
     <l n="195">The women with sure instinct knew his need ;</l>
     <l n="196">They lightly on him laid one covering more ,</l>
     <l n="197">For now the coolness of the night was nigh ,</l>
     <l n="198">And again wished for him the gift of sleep .</l>
     <l n="199">And again Shimei slept , to wake refreshed</l>
     <l n="200">Then when the moonless sky was bright with stars ,</l>
     <l n="201">Stars that not more intently over all</l>
     <l n="202">Watched , than those faithful had watched over him .</l>
     <l n="203">Refection from their hands , both heedful meet</l>
     <l n="204">And choicest possible to case like theirs ,</l>
     <l n="205">Strengthened the faster for a night-long sleep ,</l>
     <l n="206">Which with the morning brought him back himself ,</l>
     <l n="207">A self with pity and terror purified ,</l>
     <l n="208">But better purified with thanks and love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="209">So , lapt in a delightsome consciousness ,</l>
     <l n="210">Half haze , a kind of infant consciousness ,</l>
     <l n="211">Of being changed to other than before ,</l>
     <l n="212">Shimei slid sweetly on in reverie —</l>
     <l n="213">No words , nay , thoughts even not , pure reverie ;</l>
     <l n="214">But if that mist of musing in his mind</l>
     <l n="215">Had into thoughts , like star-dust into stars ,</l>
     <l n="216">Been orbed , their purport such as this had been :</l>

     <l n="219">Was ever mine to be my proper self .</l>
     <l n="220">All standing-ground seems melted under me ,</l>
     <l n="221">Planted whereon I might with hope resist .</l>
     <l n="222">It is all emptiness , all nothingness</l>
     <l n="223">About me , I am utter helplessness .</l>
     <l n="224">Yet somehow it is blesséd helplessness !</l>
     <l n="225">Let Him do with me as He will , Who now</l>
     <l n="226">Is dealing thus with me through these ! O ye ,</l>
     <l n="227">His ministers , O , holy women , ye ,</l>
     <l n="228">Behold , I give myself through you to Him !</l>
     <l n="229">Ye have conquered me for Him at last with love .</l>
     <l n="230">No weapons have I to withstand such might .</l>
     <l n="231">Tell Paul that he and ye have overcome</l>
     <l n="232">For that both he and ye were overcome</l>
     <l n="233">Yourselves first by the love that made you love</l>
     <l n="234">Even me , even me , even me , grown gray in sin ,</l>
     <l n="235">Such sin , amid such light , against such love !</l>
     <l n="236">Forgive ye me , forgive , forgive , forgive ,</l>
     <l n="237">And pray ye all that I may be forgiven</l>
     <l n="238">Of Him to Whom henceforth , unworthy I</l>
     <l n="239">To be at all accepted to such thrall ,</l>

     <l n="241">Thus Shimei , in his formless fantasy ,</l>
     <l n="242">Which being nor word , nor thought , still less was will ,</l>
     <l n="243">Mused , like a river lapsing to the sea ;</l>
     <l n="244">So softly did an inner current draw</l>
     <l n="245">Him unresisting whither it desired .</l>
     <l n="246">It seemed to Shimei , in that strong access</l>
     <l n="247">And overflow of feeling new to him ,</l>
     <l n="248">As if it would be easy to speak out .</l>
     <l n="249">Nay , but as if he must at once speak out ,</l>
     <l n="250">Aloud , for those to hear toward whom he now</l>

     <l n="252">He never did so speak , alas , but wronged</l>
     <l n="253">Himself , wronged them , refraining ; more , the Spirit</l>
     <l n="254">Of grace nigh quenched with silence ! So it fared</l>
     <l n="255">With Shimei then , self-shut from needful speech ,</l>
     <l n="256">As might it with some tender plant denied</l>
     <l n="257">Its freedom of the sun and air , that peaks</l>
     <l n="258">And pines and cannot open into flower .</l>
     <l n="259">Perhaps the habit of his heart life-long</l>
     <l n="260">Was winter all too fast for any spring</l>
     <l n="261">To solve ; perhaps he could not , if he would ,</l>
     <l n="262">Unbind its cold constriction from himself</l>
     <l n="263">For welcome and exchange of sweet good-will</l>
     <l n="264">Such as he felt rife round him in the air ,</l>
     <l n="265">Wooing him , like bland weather , toward full bloom</l>
     <l n="266">In frank affections and fair courtesies .</l>
     <l n="267">Sad , if indeed the faculty in him</l>
     <l n="268">Of finer feeling and the word to fit</l>
     <l n="269">Were lost through long disuse , or by abuse !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="270">But it was much in Shimei that thenceforth</l>
     <l n="271">He never was bitter again with cynicism ;</l>

     <l n="273">He never vented blast of unbelief</l>
     <l n="274">To blight the region round him with black death</l>

     <l n="279">Shimei , in frugal phrase , but phrase sincere ,</l>

     <l n="327">Name by himself in hope , not without fear ,</l>
     <l n="328">Pronounced — like costliest pearl at venture flung</l>

   <p>BOOK XII .</p>
   <p>PAUL AND KRISHNA .</p>
   <p>Felix and Drusilla on the one hand and Krishna on the other disclose the contrasted feelings severally excited in them by what they had just witnessed in the lot of Shimei . Krishna seeks from his friend Sergius Paulus explanation of the relations that subsisted between those ministering Christians and the sufferer . He at length requests and obtains an interview with Paul , and the two have a conversation , one result of which is that Krishna asks to hear a full account of the life and character of Jesus Christ . Paul proposes that Mary Magdalené give this account , but Krishna courteously declines to receive it from the lips of a woman . The ship meantime puts in at The Fair Havens , whence , after a short stay in that anchorage , it sets sail , against the advice of Paul .</p>

     <l n="48">So long in shadow from her husband 's mood ,</l>
     <l n="49">Was under power of gloomy imaginings .</l>
     <l n="50">Yet , felt or feigned her fears , she made them spells</l>

     <l n="77">Drusilla to such savage cynicism</l>

     <l n="79">It were not wise in anything to cross</l>

     <l n="18">Desired it as a morsel to its maw .</l>
     <l n="19">The ship through all her timbers groaned and shrieked</l>
     <l n="20">And all her joints seemed melting with the fray</l>

     <l n="22">At their wits ’ end , those mariners distraught ,</l>

     <l n="29">The dismal daylight dawned , and wind and wave ,</l>

     <l n="45">Outburning sun and moon and star all quenched</l>

Felix and Drusilla , freshly angered at Paul , resolve together on his destruction . A second meeting assembles to hear Mary 's story . This time there is an interruption occasioned by a disturbing written message from Felix , sent to Julius the centurion , one of the listeners .</p>

     <l n="8">That sore-felt loss of brutal privilege</l>
     <l n="9">By being more insolent still where yet he may :</l>
     <l n="10">So Felix now wreaked his revenge on Paul .</l>

   <p>BOOK XV .</p>
   <p>YOUNG STEPHEN AND FELIX .</p>
   <p>Drusilla has a confidential conference with Simon the sorcerer , now recovered , though still weak . He tempts her to think of ensnaring the emperor with her charms . He insinuates into her mind the idea of making away with Felix on the ground of his being an obstacle in her path to success With this in view , he forms suddenly a plot to convict Felix in his wife 's eyes of infidelity to herself . He easily awakens Drusilla 's jealousy , and she , with her own motives , enters into Simon 's present proposals . Eunicé is accordingly invited to visit Drusilla as one repentant and desirous of being a Christian — Felix having meantime been filled by Simon with the notion that Eunicé is enamored of him , Felix . She comes with her mother to Felix 's house , and the two are there entrapped ; but at the crisis of danger they are rescued by young Stephen .</p>

     <l n="411">But capable of awe from virtue shown</l>
     <l n="412">Lovelier with noble wrath ; Felix admired</l>

     <l n="422">Him , with such instance as spared needless words ,</l>
     <l n="423">He hurried forth to find and fetch back Paul .</l>

     <l n="442">Distended his fine nostrils with disdain ,</l>
     <l n="443">His right arm raised in gesture to forefend ,</l>

     <l n="456">The youth that worthily bore her father 's name</l>
     <l n="457">And worthily held the empire of her heart .</l>

     <l n="468">With dumb and blank refusal of reply ;</l>
     <l n="469">Then grudged him this : “ I into the wolf 's den</l>
     <l n="470">Enter to rend the ravin from his paw . ”</l>
     <l n="471">The youth thus having spoken half-way turned</l>

     <l n="474">To Felix than for intimate passion of love ,</l>
     <l n="475">Said : “ Haste , fly ! I will follow as I may . ”</l>

     <l n="483">The eager agile stripling had no need</l>
     <l n="484">To hear that call from his belovéd ; he ,</l>

     <l n="501">Worse crazed at that sight , Felix fiercely cried :</l>
     <l n="502">“ Him ! Him ! Are ye all blind ? Seize him , I say ! ”</l>
     <l n="503">Betwixt their terror of Felix and their awe</l>
     <l n="504">Of Paul , august in his unmovéd calm</l>
     <l n="505">And venerable with virtue and with age ,</l>
     <l n="506">Well-known to them besides as one who wrought</l>
     <l n="507">With other power than mortal , the poor slaves</l>
     <l n="508">Hung helpless to perform their master 's hest .</l>
     <l n="509">“ These do not need to seize me , here I am , ”</l>

     <l n="519">Accompanied , Julius the centurion stood</l>
     <l n="520">Abruptly at the door .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="521">Stephen with his charge</l>
     <l n="522">Had met the band of soldiers on their way</l>
     <l n="523">Just as , with circumspection looking back ,</l>
     <l n="524">He saw Paul , by a different path arrived ,</l>
     <l n="525">And earlier , enter at Felix 's abode .</l>
     <l n="526">He quickly acted on a counsel new .</l>
     <l n="527">For , with a farewell of , “ Now ye are safe ,</l>
     <l n="528">Yet hie ye to the uttermost remove</l>
     <l n="529">From Felix , ” to the women spoken , he</l>
     <l n="530">Turning walked back with Julius who his pace</l>
     <l n="531">Now slacked to listen while the stripling told</l>
     <l n="532">What had befallen and how he feared for Paul</l>
     <l n="533">Imperilled in that violent house alone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="534">“ Come in good time , however hither called , ”</l>
     <l n="535">Felix to Julius said , with such a tone</l>
     <l n="536">As seemed to ask how he was thither called .</l>
     <l n="537">“ Thy servant Syrus begged that I would come , ”</l>
     <l n="538">Said Julius , “ for the safety of thy house</l>
     <l n="539">Endangered by two women and a boy ,</l>
     <l n="540">Who had found entrance and were threatening thee . ”</l>
     <l n="541">In truth , that sly young slave of Felix 's —</l>
     <l n="542">For reason ill-affected toward his lord ,</l>
     <l n="543">As much enamored of the Christian folk</l>
     <l n="544">For their fair manners , and the comely looks</l>
     <l n="545">Of some of them , and the beneficent</l>
     <l n="546">Working of wonders seen or heard from Paul —</l>
     <l n="547">Had summoned Julius in the true behoof</l>
     <l n="548">Of Ruth with her Eunicé and of Stephen ;</l>
     <l n="549">This , shrewdly under guise of service shown</l>
     <l n="550">His master . Julius understood the guile</l>
     <l n="551">And humored it , while Felix 's thick wits</l>
     <l n="552">Spread ample cover to render Syrus safe .</l>
     <l n="553">“ Of course , ” so Julius added , “ it had not seemed</l>
     <l n="554">Needful to come , but that I also heard</l>
     <l n="555">A prisoner of my charge would here be found ,</l>
     <l n="556">For whose safe keeping I am answerable . ”</l>
     <l n="557">Then glancing in a kindly neutral way</l>
     <l n="558">At Stephen , he , with show of grave rebuke</l>
     <l n="559">That could not wholly hide his lively sense</l>
     <l n="560">Of whimsical humor in the part he played</l>
     <l n="561">As mediator in such case , went on :</l>
     <l n="562">“ This Hebrew youth confesses that , in haste</l>
     <l n="563">Of spirit , he offered thee some disrespect . ”</l>
     <l n="564">With language purposely made light and vague</l>
     <l n="565">Thus the centurion glozed Stephen 's offence ,</l>
     <l n="566">Discreetly shunning to let Felix know</l>
     <l n="567">That he knew from the offender 's own report</l>
     <l n="568">How , for good cause , as to a happy end ,</l>
     <l n="569">The indignant youth inflicted on him there</l>
     <l n="570">The shame and anguish of that timely blow .</l>
     <l n="571">“ What wilt thou , my lord Felix , ” Julius asked ,</l>
     <l n="572">“ Wilt thou forgive the lad outright ? Or pleasest</l>
     <l n="573">Thou rather I condignly deal with him ? ”</l>
     <l n="574">It was astutely so proposed , to save</l>
     <l n="575">Appearances to Felix and for him .</l>
     <l n="576">Gross-witted as he was , he yet was proud ,</l>
     <l n="577">And such end of the incident appeared</l>
     <l n="578">At once some homage to his dignity</l>
     <l n="579">And an escape unhoped from threatened shame .</l>
     <l n="580">He condescended loftily to leave</l>
     <l n="581">The case of Stephen in the centurion 's hands ;</l>
     <l n="582">And the centurion presently retired</l>
     <l n="583">With Paul and Stephen both . Stephen he bade</l>
     <l n="584">See to it that he never thenceforth act</l>
     <l n="585">Less worthily of himself than he that day</l>
     <l n="586">Had done , and with no other reprimand</l>
     <l n="587">Dismissed him to rejoin his company .</l>

   <p>BOOK XVI .</p>
   <p>INTERLUDE OF KRISHNA .</p>
   <p>Publius , the governor of the island , who in gratitude to Paul for the healing of his father has opened his house to the Christians for their meetings , now expresses , through Sergius Paulus , his guest , a wish to hear himself the story that Mary Magdalené is relating . The company accordingly assemble in his house , and Publius is in courtesy asked to act as a kind of master of the feast . He accepts the part , and discharges it with much urbane demonstrativeness . Interrupting Mary at one point of her story with exclamations of surprise and pleasure , he proposes to Krishna that he offset what has just been told with something parallel from the life of his master Buddha . Krishna reluctantly complies , when , after some comment following from Paul , Mary resumes her narrative .</p>

    <head>INTERLUDE OF KRISHNA .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">For many following days in Melita</l>
     <l n="2">There was no season of hospitality</l>
     <l n="3">To man from Nature under open sky ,</l>
     <l n="4">Genial for ease and comfort out of doors .</l>
     <l n="5">But the fair spacious halls of Publius</l>
     <l n="6">Stood smiling ever ready to entertain</l>
     <l n="7">Resort of Paul or any dear to Paul</l>
     <l n="8">Whether for social worship in prayer and psalm ,</l>
     <l n="9">With hearing of Paul discourse of things divine ,</l>
     <l n="10">Or for communion sweet of friend and friend .</l>
     <l n="11">Here presently were gathered yet again</l>
     <l n="12">The company that had with one accord</l>
     <l n="13">Already twice assembled to give ear</l>
     <l n="14">To Mary Magdalené while she told</l>
     <l n="15">Her story still unfinished of the Lord .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="16">Publius , as Roman to his Roman peer —</l>
     <l n="17">And Roman peer so versed in all the arts</l>
     <l n="18">And all the accomplishments urbane that make</l>
     <l n="19">Amenity in companionship — had said</l>
     <l n="20">To Sergius Paulus ( likewise , for his sake ,</l>
     <l n="21">To Krishna ) , “ Pray thee , honor thou my house ,</l>
     <l n="22">And be content , abide with me a guest . ”</l>
     <l n="23">Now Sergius had to Publius rehearsed</l>
     <l n="24">The things that Mary those two afternoons</l>
     <l n="25">Recounted , and the Roman lord would fain</l>
     <l n="26">Hear from her lips the rest . So he was there —</l>
     <l n="27">Guest in a sort , while host , at his own hearth —</l>
     <l n="28">And Sergius Paulus said :</l>
     <l n="29">“ O Publius , thou —</l>
     <l n="30">Most welcome , as thou makest us welcome here —</l>
     <l n="31">Shalt , so it please thee , us all it will please ,</l>
     <l n="32">Be the feast-master in the present feast</l>
     <l n="33">Of story and of audience . Krishna here ” —</l>
     <l n="34">And courteous toward the Indian Sergius bowed —</l>
     <l n="35">“ Has also a story to tell us of his lord .</l>
     <l n="36">Whether with alternation and relief</l>
     <l n="37">Between our two historians , or in course ,</l>
     <l n="38">Till one have finished , be the order best ,</l>
     <l n="39">Judge thou for all , and all will grateful be . ”</l>
     <l n="40">“ Let Mary Magdalené then go on , ”</l>
     <l n="41">Said Publius , “ if she will , from where she ceased</l>
     <l n="42">At the last audience ; ” and he turned to her</l>
     <l n="43">With , “ Sergius has most kindly made me know</l>
     <l n="44">So far thy story , madam , with the rest</l>
     <l n="45">Of this good company . But , with thy peace ,</l>
     <l n="46">And with the peace of Krishna and of all ,</l>
     <l n="47">I will upon occasion interrupt —</l>
     <l n="48">For haply the occasion may arise —</l>
     <l n="49">To ask what contrast or what parallel</l>
     <l n="50">To this or that of Jesus , Buddha yields . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="51">So Mary , with some heightened flush like shame</l>
     <l n="52">To speak in this new place and presence , yet</l>
     <l n="53">Sedately like herself and with a charm</l>
     <l n="54">Already round her ambient from the pure ,</l>
     <l n="55">The perfect , the accomplished womanhood</l>
     <l n="56">That hers was , purged of self , charm by all felt</l>
     <l n="57">At once ere her beginning , thus began :</l>
     <l n="58">“ I think that I was saying , as my words</l>
     <l n="59">I stayed at our last gathering on the shore ,</l>
     <l n="60">How little like a tragedy so nigh</l>
     <l n="61">It looked to us , when we beheld the throngs</l>
     <l n="62">Strewing Christ 's way before him with their robes</l>
     <l n="63">Flung down , and with green branches of the palm ,</l>
     <l n="64">And shouting their hosannas to His name .</l>
     <l n="65">But Jesus was not blinded as were we !</l>
     <l n="66">He , on the brink of the descent arrived</l>
     <l n="67">Steep from the Mount of Olives leading down ,</l>
     <l n="68">Beheld the holy city with its sheen</l>
     <l n="69">Of splendor from the temple roofs and walls ,</l>
     <l n="70">And , far removed from glorying at the sight</l>
     <l n="71">As king might welcomed to his capital ,</l>
     <l n="72">Wept over it , with much-amazing tears ,</l>
     <l n="73">And cried : ‘ Hadst thou but known , but known , even thou ,</l>
     <l n="74">Yea , even in this thy day but known the things</l>
     <l n="75">That to thy peace belong ! But they are hid</l>
     <l n="76">Now from thine eyes . For days will come on thee — ’</l>
     <l n="77">And then such dreadful days he told us of —</l>
     <l n="78">Days which our holy apostles think are nigh ,</l>
     <l n="79">Whence their ‘ Maranatha ! ’ so often heard ,</l>
     <l n="80">Reminder watchword of the Lord at hand ,</l>
     <l n="81">They solemnly adjuring by the days</l>
     <l n="82">Reserved for our Jerusalem , a wrath</l>
     <l n="83">To come upon her to the uttermost</l>
     <l n="84">Then when He , with the angels of His power ,</l>
     <l n="85">And as the lightning shineth suddenly</l>
     <l n="86">Ablaze from one end to the other of heaven ,</l>
     <l n="87">Shall back return in clouds to execute</l>
     <l n="88">His judgment on the city that slew Him ! ”</l>
     <l n="89">“ But wherefore , ” the centurion asked once more ,</l>
     <l n="90">And Mary with a loyal look toward him</l>
     <l n="91">Of honor for his kindly courtesy</l>
     <l n="92">That day and ever bountiful to them —</l>
     <l n="93">Look too betokening welcome of his return</l>
     <l n="94">To share the audience of her tale again</l>
     <l n="95">Late interrupted by that message brought</l>
     <l n="96">Seeming to be of sinister import —</l>
     <l n="97">Mary , with such a meaning so conveyed ,</l>
     <l n="98">Paused , while the friendly Roman plied his quest :</l>
     <l n="99">“ But wherefore did Jerusalem desire</l>
     <l n="100">To slay one innocent of crime like him ?</l>
     <l n="101">Some reason of state I dared to guess there was ,</l>
     <l n="102">But what the reason of state , thou didst not tell , ”</l>
     <l n="103">Turning to Paul he said , and Paul replied :</l>
     <l n="104">“ The Jewish rulers of the people said :</l>
     <l n="105">‘ This Jesus , if we let him thus alone ,</l>
     <l n="106">Will draw all men to follow after him ;</l>
     <l n="107">The Romans then will come and take away</l>
     <l n="108">Alike this city which belongs to us ,</l>
     <l n="109">Yea , and the nation over which we rule . ’</l>

   <p>BOOK XVIII .</p>
   <p>KRISHNA .</p>
   <p>The company still together though the hour is late , Krishna , at the request of Publius , after a breathing-spell enjoyed by all under the open sky , tells the story of the death of Buddha . A warning recited by him as having proceeded from the dying Buddha 's lips against all speech on the part of his disciples with womankind , prompts Krishna to turn , with apology in his manner , in a kind of appeal to Paul , who , answering , gives the contrasted teaching of Christianity on this topic . At the conclusion of Krishna 's recital , Publius makes a few characteristic observations suggested by it , and the company , having first agreed to assemble on some favorable day at dawn to hear from Mary the story of the resurrection of Jesus , disperse .</p>

     <l n="19">And yet a note of shallow in his tone</l>

     <l n="21">This , Krishna with a fine discernment felt</l>
     <l n="22">When Publius turned to him , and made demand :</l>
     <l n="23">“ And now , O Krishna , tell us thou of him ,</l>
     <l n="24">Thy master Buddha , how he met his death .</l>

     <l n="70">That doubtful , that uncertain , which he thus</l>

     <l n="72">To the eyewitness truth and lifelikeness</l>

   <p>BOOK XIX .</p>
   <p>BAPTISM OF KRISHNA .</p>
   <p>Krishna , much wrought upon in his secret mind , seeks a private interview with Paul . The two converse at large , Paul expounding his doctrine of sin and of salvation through faith in Christ . Krishna resists , feeling nevertheless an impulse in himself responsive to Paul 's words . They part with nothing concluded between them , but Krishna meditating alone is finally brought to obedience of faith . He seeks the company of the Christian disciples and declares himself a believer . He expressing eager desire to testify as soon as possible in some outward act commanded by Jesus his readiness to obey Him , Paul tells him of the command “ Be baptized , ” and Krishna accordingly is baptized by Aristarchus , Paul giving the new disciple appropriate counsel and exhortation .</p>

   <p>BOOK XX .</p>
   <p>EUTHANASY .</p>
   <p>Ruth and Mary Magdalené waking very early talk with one another having not yet risen , and Mary discloses a placid premonition that she has of her own imminent death . They thus engaged , a signal sound from without is heard in notes from Stephen on his pipe . The summons is for the meeting proposed to hear Mary 's story of the resurrection .</p>
   <p>The company repair to a hilltop of easy access and goodly prospect , where after a matin prayer from Paul Mary tells her story . She has scarcely ended , when she gently sinks in death . Paul on occasion of this speaks comfortingly , not without tears of personal sorrow for Mary 's loss , of the resurrection awaiting the dead in Christ .</p>
   <p>Meantime Simon the sorcerer having observed from a distance the meeting of the Christians puts his own sinister interpretation on what occurred , which , so interpreted , he reports , to Paul 's disadvantage , to Felix and Drusilla , with suggestion of use that may be made of it in evidence against the apostle at Rome .</p>
   <p>At sunset of the same day the Christians gather to the burial of Mary on the spot where she died , and Paul describes the promised return of Jesus to accomplish the triumphant rapture and resurrection of the saints .</p>

     <l n="403">Walking thus early , why I could not guess ;</l>

     <l n="405">I , heeding to be hid from them the while ,</l>

     <l n="421">Of uncouth baleful words at Cæsarea !</l>
     <l n="422">Paul got all seated ; but one sat apart ,</l>
     <l n="423">The destined victim of his wicked wiles ,</l>
     <l n="424">A woman she , that Mary Magdalené ,</l>
     <l n="425">Like an accused impaled to make defence .</l>

     <l n="429">Made her apology — of course in vain .</l>
     <l n="430">The spell that Paul had cast upon her wrought ,</l>

     <l n="532">“ Concerning her who sleeps here , think aright ;</l>

     <l n="534">Who have no hope . We have a hope . Our hope</l>

     <l n="567">Paul indeed craved the touch of human love ,</l>

     <l n="569">And medicine to sorrow ; but in part</l>
     <l n="570">It was for his companions ’ own behoof</l>

   <p>ARRIVAL .</p>
   <p>The day following , the shipwrecked company embark on a vessel that had wintered at Melita and sail for Puteoli . The islanders give Paul and his companions a grateful farewell of good wishes and of presents for their cheer . With Felix and Drusilla goes as a fresh addition to their train a Phrygian runaway slave whom Syrus , a young slave of Felix 's , has befriended and has devised thus to get safely to Rome . Stephen is made confidant of this plan , and becoming interested in the runaway introduces him to Paul . The foot journey from Puteoli to Rome is accomplished , the approach to that city being made along the Appian Way . Various reflections are inspired in Paul by this experience and by the sight of the metropolis itself . At Rome , the Phrygian runaway slave goes to Paul 's quarters , merged in the daily concourse that throngs thither to hear the gospel . Having been converted , he is encouraged by Paul to return to his master . This he finally does , carrying with him a letter from Paul . The result is , that the slave at the wish of the master comes joyfully back to Rome and devotes himself to the loving service of Paul .</p>

     <l n="5">Her destined voyage to Puteoli .</l>
     <l n="6">The master 's thought had been to put to sea</l>
     <l n="7">That selfsame day whose beamy morn beheld</l>
     <l n="8">The meeting on the hill in Melita ;</l>
     <l n="9">But the centurion intervened to bid</l>
     <l n="10">Delay the sailing yet another day :</l>
     <l n="11">His mind was with his prisoners to embark</l>
     <l n="12">Himself on that Egyptian ship for Rome ;</l>
     <l n="13">And , partly out of kindly complaisance</l>
     <l n="14">Toward Paul , and partly from a sympathy</l>
     <l n="15">Unconscious , or ashamed and unconfessed</l>
     <l n="16">Of interest in the tale that Mary told ,</l>
     <l n="17">He would not let the purposes he knew</l>

     <l n="20">On a smooth sea beneath a smiling sky .</l>
     <l n="21">A concourse of the grateful islanders</l>
     <l n="22">Flowed to the quay with signals of farewell</l>
     <l n="23">And blessing and with honors manifold</l>

     <l n="32">Touched Rhegium where another day they bide .</l>
     <l n="33">Then , the south blowing , they once more set sail</l>

     <l n="39">This was a slave , a Phrygian runaway ,</l>
     <l n="40">Out of Colossæ strayed to Melita</l>
     <l n="41">But in his wish and purpose aimed for Rome :</l>
     <l n="42">He should be safely lost in multitude</l>
     <l n="43">Drowned in the depths of that metropolis .</l>
     <l n="44">The shifty Syrus , fond of his device ,</l>
     <l n="45">And not without true kindness in his heart ,</l>
     <l n="46">Meeting the fugitive had befriended him .</l>
     <l n="47">Onesimus — such name the bondman bore —</l>
     <l n="48">He wisely warned that , wandering unattached</l>
     <l n="49">And destitute ( for spent long since was all</l>
     <l n="50">He had in starting from his lord purloined ) ,</l>
     <l n="51">He advertised himself for what he was ,</l>
     <l n="52">A vagrant slave , and ran a needless risk .</l>
     <l n="53">“ Attach thyself , ” said Syrus , “ to the train</l>
     <l n="54">Of my lord Felix ; I will manage it</l>
     <l n="55">He shall receive thee ; he delights in pomp</l>
     <l n="56">And show as does Drusilla too his spouse ,</l>
     <l n="57">And they would gladly swell their retinue</l>
     <l n="58">With one head more to make them great at Rome .</l>

     <l n="68">And hast perhaps some small peculium gained ,</l>
     <l n="69">And in turn help who freely now helps thee . ”</l>
     <l n="70">Onesimus , so doing as Syrus planned</l>
     <l n="71">His part , was reckoned of lord Felix slave ,</l>
     <l n="72">And on that vessel sailed with him to Rome .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="73">Now that which Syrus had , on Stephen 's behalf</l>

     <l n="76">In his own house in Melita such harm —</l>
     <l n="77">This , Stephen in time had come to know ; nor ceased</l>
     <l n="78">Thenceforth to wish that he might recompense</l>
     <l n="79">In some kind to the bondman his good will .</l>
     <l n="80">His grateful wish Stephen had signified</l>

     <l n="82">To make the Hebrew youth a confidant</l>
     <l n="83">Of his devices for Onesimus .</l>
     <l n="84">Thus Stephen with Onesimus had talked ;</l>

     <l n="86">Transacted as in secret to avoid</l>
     <l n="87">Felix 's , more , Drusilla 's , jealous watch —</l>
     <l n="88">Not often but so many times as served</l>
     <l n="89">To yield some true impression to the youth</l>
     <l n="90">Of what the slave was in his manhood 's worth ,</l>
     <l n="91">And to inflame a generous desire</l>
     <l n="92">Of rescue for him to a nobler life .</l>
     <l n="93">Stephen spoke of Onesimus to Paul ,</l>
     <l n="94">And Paul on shipboard came to speech with him .</l>
     <l n="95">The runaway 's heart was wholly won to Paul ;</l>
     <l n="96">And ere those parted at Puteoli</l>
     <l n="97">Onesimus had gladly promised Stephen</l>
     <l n="98">To seek his uncle out , arrived in Rome .</l>
     <l n="99">A sequel thence redounded to the slave</l>
     <l n="100">Of boundless blessing he had dreamed not of ;</l>
     <l n="101">Likewise of good to men in every age</l>
     <l n="102">Wherever might be found fit soul to be</l>
     <l n="103">Ennobled to the touch of noble thought ,</l>
     <l n="104">In answerable style with nobleness</l>
     <l n="105">Conveyed , and purified fine feeling , borne</l>
     <l n="106">To perfect heavenly-mindedness yet sweet</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="108">For Felix and Drusilla , disembarked ,</l>

     <l n="111">The showiest that in their impoverished plight</l>
     <l n="112">They could make shift to invest themselves withal .</l>
     <l n="113">But Paul with his companions , good heart 's cheer</l>
     <l n="114">Met at Puteoli ; a brotherhood</l>

   <p>BOOK XXII .</p>
   <p>DRUSILLA AND NERO .</p>
   <p>While Paul in chains is writing to Christian churches letters characterized at once by the sublimest reaches of spiritual vision and by the most painstaking condescension to details of practical precept , Simon the sorcerer , with Felix and Drusilla , plots the apostle 's death . Simon proceeds by indirection , having it in mind to bring about the death of Felix also . This he accomplishes , with the collusion and complicity of Drusilla . But first , at Drusilla 's instance , he procures for her in company with her husband an audience with Nero , of which Poppæa , the emperor 's favorite , is secretly an observer . Poppæa notices the impression made on her sovereign by Drusilla , and she is openly present at a subsequent hearing granted by Nero to the beautiful Jewess , during which the latter accuses Paul , together with other crimes , of instigating the murder by poison of Felix . Nero throughout displays , with much license , his reckless and frivolous character .</p>

   <p>BOOK XXIII .</p>
   <p>NERO AND SIMON .</p>
   <p>Simon , sent by Drusilla to the emperor , finds it impossible to reach the imperial presence without help from Poppæa , who grants him her favor only on condition that he will serve her wish at need . The crafty sorcerer buys his way with the necessary promises . Nero flouts Simon with disdainful irony and sarcasm , which excites the sorcerer 's resentment . This feeling he dissembles , while he counsels the unfaithful imperial husband how to rid himself of his young empress Octavia — the sorcerer being all the time in doubt whether it is with Drusilla or with Poppæa that the emperor , who speaks darkly , would supplant her .</p>
   <p>Nero at length dismisses Simon , bidding him tell his mistress the emperor 's desire to pay her a secret visit . This message the sorcerer gratifies his own spleen by conveying to Drusilla in terms the most offensive to her pride . She bursts out in violent anger and spurning ; but Simon shows his mistress how she may salve in a measure the hurt to her dignity , and at the same time serve her hatred of Paul , by making it a condition of her complaisance that the emperor shall first put the apostle and his companions to death . The sorcerer returns with her reply to Nero , who again , and even more deeply than before , stirs the Jew 's heart to deadly hatred . Simon plots a wild scheme to have his revenge . Meantime with change in certain officers of the government the aspect of affairs grows threatening for Paul and his fellow-Christians . Onesimus and Syrus are arrested and hurried away to suffer on the rack .</p>

     <l n="4">She charged her minion to bend all his craft</l>

     <l n="7">Might , without let from other present , try</l>
     <l n="8">If for once only what of power was left</l>
     <l n="9">Her , after such misfortunes suffered late ,</l>
     <l n="10">To steal possession of the hearts of men .</l>
     <l n="11">“ Consider , Simon , what might not I do</l>
     <l n="12">For thee , once seated in that place of power ? ”</l>
     <l n="13">She with such words and with a subtle smile</l>
     <l n="14">Of deep insinuation cheered him forth .</l>

     <l n="15">But Simon , in an outer anteroom</l>

     <l n="17">Many removes from where the emperor was —</l>
     <l n="18">Long hung in waiting day by day in vain .</l>
     <l n="19">At length Poppæa , not the emperor ,</l>
     <l n="20">Sent gracious word that she would see that Jew .</l>
     <l n="21">“ Thou hadst perhaps forgotten who it was , ”</l>
     <l n="22">The favorite , drunken-fond of power nor less</l>
     <l n="23">Of demonstration too of power , began ,</l>
     <l n="24">To dash the sorcerer in his confidence —</l>
     <l n="25">“ Say , hadst thou not forgotten who it was</l>
     <l n="26">Gave thee for thy Drusilla her desired</l>

     <l n="30">He readily commanded to his face</l>
     <l n="31">A trouble of confusion and chagrin ,</l>
     <l n="32">And stammered something inarticulate .</l>
     <l n="33">The merciless Poppæa pressed her point :</l>

     <l n="35">I heard thee offer service of thine art ?</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="41">Simon her humor flattered to its height ,</l>

     <l n="43">Before her , till he judged her satisfied</l>
     <l n="44">That his humiliation was complete .</l>
     <l n="45">Then , with abject profession of remorse</l>
     <l n="46">And shame that he so far forgot her due</l>
     <l n="47">As to seek audience with the emperor</l>
     <l n="48">In any way other than through herself ,</l>
     <l n="49">He humbly asked her what her wish might be ;</l>
     <l n="50">In short , renewed the proffer of himself</l>
     <l n="51">To be her faithful servant all in all .</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="52">“ But art thou not in prior duty bound</l>

     <l n="54">“ Yea , doubtless , ” the adroit dissembler said —</l>
     <l n="55">A protestation of deep loyalty</l>
     <l n="56">To his old mistress , not to be seduced ,</l>
     <l n="57">Commingling strangely in his look and tone</l>
     <l n="58">With offer to be serviceable now .</l>
     <l n="59">“ Supposing beautiful Drusilla 's aims</l>

     <l n="67">That suckles them in vain . ” “ What meanest thou ? ”</l>
     <l n="68">Poppæa asked . “ Why , this , ” the sorcerer said ,</l>
     <l n="69">“ Lady Drusilla 's interests and her aims</l>
     <l n="70">May not agree . They do not , if her aims</l>

     <l n="72">True interests , I mean , she best consults</l>
     <l n="73">In being to her sovereign loyal liege .</l>
     <l n="74">I serve the subject , when I serve the queen . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="75">“ ‘ Empress , ’ thou namest me , ” Poppæa said .</l>
     <l n="76">“ Thou knowest I am not empress . ” “ Yea , I know , ”</l>
     <l n="77">Said Simon , “ empress not in name — as yet . ”</l>
     <l n="78">“ Another , ” with deep implication said</l>
     <l n="79">Poppæa , “ that imposing title bears . ”</l>
     <l n="80">“ Were it not so , ” with apt intelligence ,</l>
     <l n="81">Made instant answer Simon , “ thou wouldst not</l>
     <l n="82">Need modestly disclaim the title — thou</l>
     <l n="83">Who worthily possessest now the power . ”</l>
     <l n="84">“ Not all the power , ” Poppæa sagely said ;</l>
     <l n="85">“ Some real part of the power is in the name .</l>
     <l n="86">Help me to win the name , and fix thy price . ”</l>
     <l n="87">“ My price would be the pleasure I should have</l>
     <l n="88">To see thee sitting , where thy right ere now</l>
     <l n="89">Had placed thee , on the half throne of the world ” —</l>
     <l n="90">So Simon with devout obeisance said .</l>
     <l n="91">Then added : “ If the emperor should suspect —</l>
     <l n="92">But , pardon , thou hast asked me nothing yet . ”</l>
     <l n="93">“ I ask thee now , speak freely out to me</l>
     <l n="94">All that is in thy mind , ” Poppæa said .</l>
     <l n="95">“ If then , I say , the emperor should suspect —</l>
     <l n="96">Of course with ground for the suspicion ( that</l>
     <l n="97">Well understood , no innocent to be wronged ) ” —</l>
     <l n="98">And Simon grinned intolerably a wry</l>
     <l n="99">Involuntary grin of import such ,</l>
     <l n="100">So horribly conveyed , that almost she ,</l>
     <l n="101">Poppæa , shuddered in recoil from him —</l>
     <l n="102">“ Suspect , with reason shown , a full supply ,</l>
     <l n="103">That the young partner of his bed and throne ,</l>
     <l n="104">Octavia , is less worthy of his faith</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="106">“ Aye , I see , I see , ” broke</l>
     <l n="107">Poppæa , her instinctive first recoil</l>
     <l n="108">Quite overmastered ; it was of the flesh ,</l>
     <l n="109">Mere backward creep of muscle and of nerve ,</l>
     <l n="110">Repugnance of the inner spirit none .</l>
     <l n="111">“ But to supply the reason — ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="112">“ Shall be mine , ”</l>
     <l n="113">Said Simon , finishing her arrested speech .</l>
     <l n="114">He undertook at venture in the dark ;</l>
     <l n="115">But to gain time , and to secure access ,</l>
     <l n="116">His present errand , to the emperor ,</l>
     <l n="117">He added , with demure and downcast look :</l>
     <l n="118">“ The ground beneath us now is treacherous ;</l>
     <l n="119">I could with greater freedom utter all</l>
     <l n="120">That might be needful in such case as this ,</l>
     <l n="121">To other ear than thine , O empress fair ,</l>
     <l n="122">Or any woman 's . Let me , pray thee , see</l>
     <l n="123">The emperor . Thou shalt be well satisfied ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="125">So Simon won him clear for then , and went —</l>
     <l n="126">His way made easy by Poppæa 's part ;</l>
     <l n="127">Yet not as with her privity , much less</l>
     <l n="128">As with her favor openly displayed —</l>
     <l n="129">To his wished waiting on the emperor .</l>

     <l n="133">A little , he so little wont to wince .</l>
     <l n="134">What did it mean ? Had Nero overheard</l>
     <l n="135">Through some eavesdropper what had just now passed</l>
     <l n="136">Between him and Poppæa ? Was he vexed ?</l>
     <l n="137">Himself at least was inly vexed to hear</l>
     <l n="138">The opprobrious name of ‘ go-between ’ applied ,</l>
     <l n="139">Where he had hoped for honor as a mage</l>

   <p>BOOK XXIV .</p>
   <p>THE END .</p>
  </body>
  <back>
   <note>The two slaves , Onesimus and Syrus , bear their torture with constancy , refusing to testify otherwise than in grateful praise of Paul . The emperor , at Seneca 's prompting , has secretly overheard their testimony , and , obeying a caprice of justice and of pity , he follows a further hint from Seneca to let Paul go free under bond to appear again when formal accusation shall be laid against him from Jerusalem . Paul thus released sends home to Holy Land the friends that had thence accompanied him to Rome , and accomplishes his last missionary tours , with Luke only for companion . Meantime Drusilla , in a desperate hope revived by the rumored fall from imperial favor of Poppæa , sends Simon once more to secure for his mistress the long-postponed meeting with Nero . Simon plays Drusilla false and pretends to the emperor that she had indulgently sent him , Simon , to sue on his own behalf for the privilege of practising his art in the palace . Nero agrees that he may do this on condition that he shall first have secured from his mistress fresh consent to receive an imperial visit in her house . Simon , stung by the emperor 's scorn of him , had wrought himself up to the temerity of attempting to play on Nero 's guilty conscience by an exhibition that should bring up before the tyrant a dreadful recollection of one of his own most heinous crimes . The result proves suddenly fatal to Simon . Paul , brought back in due time for trial , becomes the victim not only of enmity openly working under legal forms against him , but of secret intrigue for unholy personal purposes on the emperor 's part . Condemned to die , after having been permitted first to speak in his own defence , the apostle is led to a suburb of Rome , and there beheaded . Luke , enjoined thereto by Paul , gives to his kindred and friends in Palestine an account of the end , of which he was eye-witness .</note>
   <note>THE END . Onesimus and Syrus had been seized To make them swear a dreadful perjury ; It was persuasion from Drusilla wrought With Tigellinus to commit this deed Of outrage against ruth and righteousness : Those bondmen should be brought , by utmost pangs Wreaked on them in the anguish of the rack , To charge Paul with the poisoning of her spouse . Drusilla first had vainly sought to bribe Poor Syrus to that lie and perfidy . Smiles , blandishments , entreaties , promises , Failing — she next , with scourgings from her tongue , Threats , thrusts from female weapons in her hands , Had striven to warp him to her wish — in vain . At last she , giving him up for torture , yet Bade him remember he need only swear , Therein supported by Onesimus , That from Paul 's hand he had a dust received — Impalpable , so fine — of unknown power To work unknown effect upon a man , And had by Paul instructed been to sift This secretly into some draught his lord Would drink , and watch how it would gladden him — That he had only to protest that lie , Confessing then that , in all innocence Of childish curiosity to see , He did it when his mistress sent by him A sleeping-draught to Felix in his bath — Only just this , and straight for both of them , Onesimus with Syrus , the sharp pains And rending of the question should be stayed . Syrus said sadly to Onesimus : “ O , would that Paul were here to give us heart ! ” “ Jesus is here , and He will give us heart , ” Onesimus replied ; “ let us trust Him . ” “ I fear I shall be broken to their will , ” Said Syrus , “ and swear whatever they desire ; I am so in terror of the frightful pain ! ” This was while they were binding the poor slaves Upon the rack . His comrade spoke in cheer : “ ‘ Lo , I am with you alway , ’ Jesus said ; He will not let us suffer overmuch . I shall not wonder if He take away The pain , almost — or altogether even . For He abideth faithful — so Paul says , And Paul has proved it over and over again . At any rate , the promise Jesus made To Paul once , when his need was very sore , Will be as good to us in this our stead ; His grace will be sufficient for us still . The dread is heavier than the pain will be . ” And it was so ; for after the first wrench , Which well-nigh solved the jointings of their limbs , The spirit rose the sovereign of the flesh And bore those helpless victims of the rack Triumphant as in painless ecstasy . Their mortal frames became as instruments Of music underneath the player 's hand ; For every quivering nerve within them strung Responded to the running torture 's touch In bursts of exclamation like the notes Of a song sung to some pathetic tune Wherein the pathos still keeps triumphing : “ Lord Jesus , this for Thee ! ” “ And this ! ” “ O , joy That we are counted worthy thus to suffer ! ” “ It is not suffering , since for Thee we suffer ! ” Meanwhile to every challenge touching Paul , Though thrills of anguish broke their speech to cries , They said , and would forever only say : “ He taught us nothing but to reverence Our masters with all good fidelity Of service rendered them out of true hearts As to the Lord in heaven and not to men . ” By secret orders from the emperor The torture-room was cunningly contrived To be a sort of whispering gallery , An ear of Dionysius , to resound Whatever might be uttered from the rack Wrung out of victims put to question there — Words , cries , sighs , groans , or moans of agony — And carry them to distance where above , If one should listen , they might all be heard . Here Nero laid a listening ear that day — Seneca 's prompting , who was present too — And heard Onesimus and Syrus bear Their steadfast witness on behalf of Paul , With adjuration mingled of a Name . The not yet utterly extinguished spark Of human in that indurated breast ( Perhaps therewith effect of fear infused — Divinely — at such adjuration heard ) Responded in a transitory glow Of something gentle that resembled ruth Toward those poor sufferers faithful against pain ; Of something that resembled justice too Toward Paul so stoutly witnessed for by them . He forthwith bade release the witnesses ; And hearkened to a counsel touching Paul . For Seneca adventured this to him — A farewell flicker of his influence , Ere Tigellinus overbore him quite —: “ Shouldst thou think well it might indeed be well , To loose this Jewish prisoner from his thrall — He giving surety under ample bond To answer with his person at the bar Of Cæsar upon summons , to be tried Whenever shall appear accusers sent Accredited from Jerusalem to Rome . ” So out of darkness there sprang up a light To Paul , and for that present he went free . Soon at a meeting of thanksgiving held To celebrate with praises to the Lord His unexpected riddance out of thrall Paul to his brethren and his kindred said : “ My life reprieved from threatened death in shame , I dedicate anew to Christ the Lord . I go hence , parting from you all with tears Of joyful love , and thanks for love again Mine in full measure from so many hearts That have not here my bonds in Christ despised — I go hence , in the Spirit bound , to bear Far as I may abroad in all the world The glorious gospel of the blesséd God . Pray for me that I may be sped in peace , And that before me doors of utterance may Swing open wide wherever I am led . The time is short for all of us ; for me Shorter , it may be , than our present joy Buoys us to hope . Perhaps the Lord will come And find me waking still — and not asleep — To welcome Him descending in the air . Amen ! So may it be ! Lord Jesus , come ! “ And yet , belovéd , though these words I speak , A more prevailing prescience in my heart Forewarns me I shall witness with my blood For Him who suffered unto blood for me . If so it be , amen ! Lord Jesus , yea , Thy will for me is my will for myself ; I spring to it with joy , or far or near — Unknown to me — enough that it is Thine ! “ So , farewell , ye . Watch and remember , all , That by the space of two full years in chains I have not ceased to warn you night and day , Each one , with tears . And now , behold , I know That some of you to whom I have fulfilled This ministry shall see my face no more . O , brethren , I commend you unto God ! Be perfect , be of brave and hopeful cheer , Be of one mind , abide in peace , and He , The God of love and peace , shall with you be . O , how my heart is large toward you ! The love Of God , the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , And the communion of the Holy Ghost Be with you and abound — ever ! Amen ! ” Therewith Paul kneeled and prayed a breaking prayer ; And they all wept , and he wept with them all , They falling on his neck and kissing him In love and sorrow . Each one with himself ‘ Among them , I ? ’ asked , and so sorrowed most Of all for that word which he spoke , “ I know That some of you shall see my face no more . ” Paul sent his kindred and his lovers — those Who for his sake had sailed with him to Rome — Back to find home again in Holy Land , While he , with Luke for his companion sole , Should run his rounds of mission through the world . “ But what ye can , ” he said , “ before ye go , Comfort Onesimus and Syrus , sick With wounding for Christ 's sake and mine ; I have Already bathed Onesimus with tears Of love , and bidden him in Christ be strong : Ye will not leave him till his health be whole At least enough to take the journey back To our Philemon , bearing thanks from me . “ Those here in Rome that love me I shall trust To speed both you and him with needful aid — Even as I trust them not to let me lack . Onesimus no doubt will find a way That ye could not , nor I , to carry help To Syrus in his far more wretched case — Beset with household craft and cruelty . Pray ye for him ; and lade Onesimus In seeking Syrus deep with love from me . Christ will not fail him , if he fail not Christ ; ‘ It is but for a moment , all the pain , ’ Charge it upon Onesimus to say , ‘ But for eternal ages is the joy ! ’ “ Now unto such as can receive it I , Under this present imminence of woe Forerunning the return of Christ the Lord , Give counsel not to marry but abide In undistracted waiting for the Day . Yet for our Stephen and Eunicé here , Already long betrothed and lovers true , My will is as their will is ; let them wed. Stephen as husband to Eunicé can In journeying better fend both her and Ruth Her mother ; he as well can fend his own , Rachel , the only — sister of my heart ! ” Paul 's voice a little failed him , ending thus ; And all took knowledge how his kindred love Broke over him , a wave of tenderness ! So Stephen and Eunicé wedded were , Paul each in turn adjuring solemnly : “ Thou , O Eunicé , wilt as wife be true , That know I well , to whom thou thus hast wed . Submit thyself to him in loyal love , And as in pledged obedience to the Lord — Less to his will so yielding than to Christ 's . For God ordains it that the husband be Head to the wife , as to the church is Christ . But thou , O Stephen , judge what sanction so Is on the husband laid , to be how pure , Above self-will and selfishness how high , How full of ministration and of help , How ready ever to self-sacrifice For the wife 's sake , how gentle and how kind ! Thou , therefore , Stephen , love thy wife , even so As the Lord Jesus loved the church , His bride , And for her gave Himself . Be happy , ye , Belovéd , in a love so sanctified . ” Paul blessed them , and they felt that they were blessed . When soon from Rome they took their homeward way — Ruth , Rachel , and the newly-wedded pair — They wept that they had looked their last on Paul ; Wept with rejoicing that , a little while , And the Lord coming would make all things glad . Now Sergius Paulus chose it for his part To fill Paul 's purse , speeding him on his way ; But Krishna was of mind himself to go With those who would return to Holy Land . He longed with his own eyes to see the scenes Amid which Jesus lived His life on earth And to glean up from the tradition found Haply there current in the mouths of men Concerning Him , both what He taught and what He was : the Indian 's thought was he would then , Full-laden with such treasures of the West , To his own native East return and there Dispense them to enrich his countrymen . Paul bade him prosper in his wish , and go . Acquitted thus of all his natural cares , And joyful in the sense of his reprieve , And springing toward the work that he would do , And for that work renewed in strength by hope And faith and love and zeal unquenchable And passion for the saving of the souls Of men , his fellows , perishing in sin — Much more , by the almighty hand of God Upon him stayed in an immortal youth — That spent old man , refusing to be spent Though spending daily like the river of God , Set forward , Luke alone companion now , To send with torch in hand a running fire Of gospel conflagration round the world . Go , Paul , forgetful of thyself , make speed ! Thou shalt not be forgotten of thy God ! Go , with that treasure for thy fellows fraught ! Go , with the future of the world in trust ! Nowhere in utmost islands of the sea , Never till time shall be no more , shall men Not owe thee debt for blessings manifold — Crowning the life that now is , frail and fleet , Crowning the nobler life that is to be — Blessings theirs but because thou wouldst not shrink From whatsoever hardship , peril , harm , Loss , toil , self-sacrifice to martyrdom . So thou mightst scatter far and wide for us The deathless seeds of that which we enjoy In harvest of all good , civility Of morals and of manners , science , art , Fair order , freedom , progress , light and life , And , overvaulting all , the hope of heaven ! While Paul his circuits was accomplishing , Paul 's enemies ( and ours ) were not remiss , Whether in Rome or in Jerusalem . Drusilla , disappointed of her hopes With Nero to ensnare his heart and be Assumed to sit beside him on his throne , Even cheated for the moment of the glut She thought she had purchased at such cost to pride Of extreme vengeance visited on Paul , Was sullenly but more than ever bent Not to fail yet of at least that desire . She saw Octavia , sent to exile , way Make for Poppæa 's spousals ; heard the shout Of shallow hollow popular acclaim That hailed her hated rival conqueror , Bearing her as on billows of applause To the high seat herself had hoped for once ! Envy and hatred ulcerous ate her heart — But not despair ; despair was not for her : Malignity was fuel still to hope . She despatched Simon to Jerusalem To blow the embers smouldering there to flame Of deadly accusation against Paul : Simon was Shimei risen from the dead , Shimei in all his pristine force unspent . The elders of the Jews commissioned him , With others to whom he was heart and head , To press at Rome for Paul the doom of death . Meantime the mouth of common fame began To whisper that Poppæa , though a wife To Nero now — perhaps because a wife And mother of a daughter , Claudia , born To him — no longer charmed him as of old . Unholy hope flared up a flicker of flame Delusive in Drusilla 's breast once more . Octavia , when her husband tired of her , Went into exile and then went to death To give Poppæa room ; Poppæa 's turn Perhaps was nearing to make room for her , Drusilla ! ‘ Up , O heart ! ’ she inly cried . The emperor had indeed with fickle whim , Dazed by some intercepting lure more nigh , Forgotten quite his thought of tryst with her — As her conditions too he had not met . But her conditions now were well in train , She trusted , to fulfill themselves on Paul ; And if before , some trace of conscience left In Nero interfered to make him pause , Such scruple would no longer be a let To his desire , should his desire revive , Of meeting her upon the terms she fixed To satisfy at once her hate , her pride . Simon then , from Jerusalem returned Blithe with his prosperous mission and with hope , Should go once more to Nero for her cause . And Simon went , but went not for her cause . He had a purpose of his own to serve — Purpose malignant , fatuous — which , fulfilled , Would swift recoil in ruin on himself . No worship to Poppæa 's setting sun Paid by him now to win his way at court , He boldly in Drusilla 's name besought Access to the imperial ear : that name Procured him instant audience . Discomposed A little by the sudden way he made Simon stood faltering , and before his wit Was ready with apt words the emperor spoke : “ What will thy mistress ? She perhaps has thought The emperor was a trifle slow to claim His privilege at her court ? Bid her take heart ; Things now begin to shape themselves aright . ” By this time Simon had recovered himself ; He said : “ My mistress is indulgent , Sire . Knowing my fondness for my art , and wish That I might entertain the emperor , She begs thou wilt appoint a time for me — ” “ O , aye , ” the emperor said ; “ return to her , And if thou canst bring promptly back to me Assurance of her grace that she forgives My tardiness in the past , and will receive Me yet upon the terms she fixed before — Somewhat abated , aye , but in the main Whole ; for although the rabble rest she named Are scattered and not worth regathering , Paul Is under hand again , duly accused , And freely may be dealt with to our wish — Bring , I say , word to me that she consents , And thou shalt exercise for me thine art At pleasure here within my palace halls . Go , and good speed , ambassador of love ! ” The sarcasm and the irony took effect To quicken in the sorcerer his resolve : For Simon his own doom was teeming now . He was infatuate with the vain conceit That he the secret in his art possessed Of a mock-supernatural power to play Upon the conscience of the emperor And fill his conscious breast with guilty fears : So once he saw Paul play on Felix 's , Making him shudder on his judgment-throne ; Aye , and so he himself in sequel played On the same kingly culprit with his spells . Beyond all , Simon was beside himself With suffocated hatred seeking breath In freak of demonstration on the man Who in the wantonness of despotic pride Had so despised and mocked and flouted him . Mad thus — judicially , and doubly — he , Having brought back the word the emperor wished , And had the promised day appointed him , Dared an audacious and a fatal thing . A series of phantasmagories shown By him , he closed with a presentment , clear In outline cast upon the palace wall In shapes of shadow moving like grim life , Of the dread scene of Agrippina 's death : There hung the vessel on a glassy sea ; The coping timbers causelessly fell down , But missed the empress-mother figured there ; There followed then the ghastly after-act Of mother-murder done in pantomime — More ghastly , that it passed in silence all . Simon mistook — it was his last mistake ! He had overweened both of the power his own , And of the emperor 's openness to fear . Nero sat gazing on the spectacle With heed moveless , and mute , and ominous , Till the device was acted to the end . Then still no sign he gave — save summons sent Bidding two household soldiers straight come in . To these he coldly , curtly , only said : “ Crucify me this Jew ; do it at once ! Be gentle with him ; make him last for days , And every day bring me report of him . ” Simon bethought him as he shuddering went Hustled and hurried to that sudden doom , Of his gold hoarded long for utmost need : He offered it in ransom for his life . The soldiers took it , share and share alike Between them , but it did not buy his life ! Simon died miserably upon the cross . ‘ I have abolished him ! ’ the emperor thought — ‘ The adamantine front of impudence ! Whimsical way of paying a lady court , To crucify her conjurer out of hand ! I hope she did not greatly care for him ! Happily if she did I can repair The loss to her by putting Paul to death . Strange , they should hate that blameless man so much ! But reasons of state are strong — and reasons of love ; I must propitiate with a sacrifice . Jove is compelled by fate mightier than he ! ’ The tetrarch Herod , to content the whim And hatred of his wife Herodias , Once at petition of her daughter fair — Whose dancing measures beat at festival Before him had , forsooth , the monarch pleased !— Sent to behead John Baptist in his prison : So Nero now in mind delivered Paul To death — an unconsidered pledge and pawn Of complaisance to a base woman paid . As were a star by some avulsive force Malignant sheer from out her pathway torn Where she went singing her celestial way Happy but to fulfill His high decree Who orbed her and who sped her on her course ( Thenceforth to be abolished from a heaven Lighted no longer with her lucent beams ! ) ; So Paul was in his heavenly circuits stayed And wrenched thence by the hand of violent power . Rome had already round him flung the loop Of her long lasso irresistible , And drawn him home to Cæsar to be judged . No little damped because their head was gone , But more because he so had disappeared , The Jews commissioned from Jerusalem Pressed fierce their suit against their fellow-Jew . Nero 's assessors sat without their chief ; For Nero was grown indolent and lax , And he deputed his judicial powers . Yet oft deigned he to give his deputies Hint of what judgment he desired from them ; And they now knew the doom required for Paul . Paul was left lonely of all men save Luke ; But Luke the faithful chose with him his part . Paul longed for Timothy , and wrote to him Bidding him haste and bring John Mark to Rome . But the end hasted more than these could haste , And Timothy was never in the flesh To greet again that father of his soul Who , for the son 's sake more than for his own , Yearned toward the son to fix in him his faith Seen nigh to falter in the face of things Such as now fronted Paul . John Mark though once In haste of spirit sundered from Paul 's part , Had long before been won again — to bide Thenceforward ever fast in loyalty ; But as not Timothy , so neither he Would comfort Paul in this his last assay . So much the more Paul 's lonely fortitude In witness amid storms of obloquy And under the impending threat of doom , Then against doom itself upon him fallen , Should at need brace them both to martyrdom . Most exquisitely human-hearted , Paul Could not but feel full sore his loneliness — Loneliness more for sense of being forsaken . “ Demas , ” to Timothy he sighed , “ has loved This present world , and has forsaken me . All men forsook me the first time I stood To make my answer at the judgment-bar ; I pray it be not laid to their account ! ” Nobly repined !— yet for a moment only ; Then cheerly added , this , and thankfully : “ Of men not one stood with me ; but the Lord , He with me stood , and cheered and strengthened me , That all the gentiles might the gospel hear ; And for that time from out the lion 's mouth I was delivered . Yea , and betide what may , Still the Lord Jesus will deliver me From every machination of ill men , And to His heavenly kingdom bring me safe . To whom be glory evermore ! Amen ! ” Enjoined thereto by Paul , Luke bore from Rome To Rachel and the rest in Holy Land — That dear companionship of kindred hearts — The tidings how all ended with his death ; Yet how , before he died , and when he died , He conquered gloriously . Luke said to them : “ He was not taken at all at unawares ; Nothing surprised and nothing daunted him . Nay , he rejoiced in spirit that all was now Finished for him on earth ; that he might lay His warrior 's harness off and take his crown . He said this to his judges with such calm Clear consciousness of speaking simple truth , Such sober confidence devoid of vaunt , That something like conviction seized on them Listening ; while on the listening multitude — For the basilica was thronged — I felt Fall a great hush and a pathetic awe . ‘ I know well whom I have believed , ’ he said , ‘ And my persuasion is complete that He Is able to keep that which I have given In trust to Him against the coming day . Yea , ye will surely send me hence to die ; The time of my departure ye have set ; So much is in your power to do to me ; But there is more , far more , beyond your power . Life ye can take , but not the good of life . The good of life is lodged where it is safe , And life indeed no power can take from me ; That is committed to almighty hands , Almighty , and all-faithful , and all-wise : There it is mine , inalienably mine . So there is that in me which bides secure From any terror men can threat me with . A witness in my heart attests that I Have fought the good fight , fought it to the end ; That I have run my race and touched the goal ; Through all temptation , I have kept the faith . I strain my eyes before me and I see , Shining , a crown , the crown of righteousness , Held in the hand once pierced and pierced for me Of the arisen Lord and glorified , The righteous Judge who will award the prize . That prize he holds for me ’ — “ Hereon , ” Luke said , “ Paul turned toward where I stood — O , how I wished There had been many others with me then To hear what I heard , and to take his look , That kindling look of large vicarious hope !— Paul turned toward me his heaven-illumined face , And added : ‘ Yea , for me holds — nor for me Alone , but with me all men also who Have loved the bright appearing of the Lord . ‘ I have been bound , but not the word of God ; That has run freely , sped around the world . I am to die , but the quick word of God , So much incapable of dying , lives Forever an invulnerable life . This Roman empire , like those empires old , Will crumble into dust and pass away ; The temples and the palaces of Rome Will vanish like a vision from men 's eyes ; But the majestic kingdom of my God Will stand forever and forever grow . Within its walls , I have not built in vain ; For I have founded on a corner-stone That never will be moved . The earth we tread Will tremble and be moved out of its place ; The heavens above us , sun and moon and star , Will yet be rolled together like a scroll , Or folded like a vestment laid aside ; But what on Jesus Christ for corner-stone I , with much prayer and many tears , in faith Have builded to the glory of His grace , Will still in ever-during beauty shine . ‘ But though I speak thus of the vanishing Of all this fabric of a mighty state , All this imperial pomp and power of Rome , And the succeeding of an order new , A heavenly kingdom with a heavenly King , Yet know , O judges , that in all good faith , I ever everywhere have taught and shown Loyal submission to the powers that be . By letter , ere I came myself to Rome , I charged this duty on my brethren here ; I told them they could not in any wise Obedient be to God , and not obey The powers by Him set over them to rule : Ask my disciples , make them witnesses , They all will testify I taught them thus . Not that my life is such a prize to me ; But I would have the holy name of Him Who bought me with His blood , and made of me A herald of His glorious grace to men — Yea , I would have that ever-blesséd Name Pure of reproach through me before you all . ‘ I thank my judges that at least I may Thus freely speak once more before I die . A cloud of witnesses around me here Hangs in my eye ; I might behold , beyond These and above , innumerably bright , Thick ranks of hovering angels beckoning me ; But I stretch out my hands in suit to these , My fellows , and beseech them one and all , And you , my judges , I beseech — and would I might beseech the whole world with my voice Now speaking for its last time in men 's ears !— Be reconciled through Jesus Christ to God . With me it is a light thing to be judged Of men ; albeit obeisance due I pay To this tribunal as ordained of God . But I look forward to be judged of One Before whose eyes the secrets of men 's hearts Lie open like the pages of a book . And ye too all who judge me , and all these Who see me judged — yea , and himself , your head , The emperor , with his counsellors , and all That under earth slumber or in the sea , The living generations and the dead , One congregation and assembly called At last together whencesoever found , Shall stand before the judgment-seat of Christ . O , I adjure you and entreat you , hear Betimes my message sent from God to you . One advocate alone , none other , can Plead to the Father with effect for you . But He can , for it is the Judge Himself Will be your advocate , if but you will Now choose Him to be such , and He will speak For you with a resistless eloquence Of wounds shown in His hands and feet and side , Signs of His suffering borne in the behalf Of all those who will come to God by Him . ‘ I have a vision of that judgment-scene : These wide-embracing walls I see expand To the horizon 's utmost rim around ; This roof is lifted to the top of heaven ; This multitude is multiplied to count Beyond all count ; yon judgment-throne becomes Dazzling beyond the splendors of the sun With an exceeding whiteness , such as eye Of man nor angel can abide to see ; And He that sits thereon , and makes it dark By the excess of brightness in His face , Speaks , and His voice to hear is as the sound Of many waters rolling down in flood . I heard that voice once speaking from the sky Amid a blaze of light falling around Me at midnoon that blanched the Syrian sun Burning from his meridian height on me . O men , my brethren , it was a dread voice ; But I obeyed it , and I therefore lived . Obey it ye , heard speaking through my lips And bidding , Come ! O , sweet and dreadful voice , Both sweet and dreadful , uttering now that word ! Dreadful , not sweet , it then will sound to those Who hearing thus the invitation , Come , Harden their hearts to disobey . For then In changed tones it will speak a different word . ‘ Hence , curséd of my Father ! ’ it will say , And drive the disobedient as with sword Of flame forth issuing and pursuing them , Pursuing and devouring , while they fly In vain forever and forever far Before it , and no refuge anywhere In all the boundless universe of God Find from the fiery fangs of that fierce sword ! ’ “ I never saw , ” said Luke , “ such pity cast Such pathos over such solemnity , Such faithfulness to God , to man , as then , While he in that hushed audience spoke these things , Lived in Paul 's looks and tuned his prophet tones . No one that listened and beheld escaped The power of God ; and some perhaps believed . “ But they condemned the guiltless man to die ; And , like his Lord , he died without the gates . They led him to a chosen spot not far Beyond the city walls — he all the way Seen walking like one meekly triumphing ; For a train followed and attended him , Before whom he was as a conqueror . Where gushed a fountain in a pine-tree shade Suburban , there they made their prisoner stay . Here they beheaded him ; Christ suffered it — What matter to His servant how he died ? The pain was short , if sharp ; perhaps indeed There was no pain at all , but only swift Transition to a state of perfect rest From pain , from weariness , from every ill , Forever in the presence of the Lord . The dear dissevered head we joined again To the worn-weary body as we could : We comforted ourselves to see the peace That the white-shining countenance expressed , And stanched our tears and eased our aching hearts To think that all his toil was over now , And all the contradiction he so long Had suffered from his thankless fellow-men ; And that he had aspired triumphantly At last to be at home with Christ in heaven , There to behold the glory that He had , Ere the beginning of the world , with God His Father . “ So we buried him in hope There on the selfsame spot where he had fallen ; And said to one another the great words , Heroic , heartening , full of heavenly truth , Himself with streaming tears once spoke to us — You will remember — then when Mary died , And when we buried her that sunset hour There on that holy hill in Melita . ” With such a gentle cadence to his tale , Luke ended ; and those sat in silence long , Remembering with sweet heart-ache what had been . Then , having knelt together first in prayer , And having lifted a pathetical High hymn of triumph over death , they rose Calm and addressed themselves anew to life : A little patience and the Lord would come .</note>

    <p>BY THE SAME AUTHOR THE EPIC OF SAUL A COMPANION TO “ THE EPIC OF PAUL ” Saul of Tarsus , brought up at Jerusalem , a pupil of Gamaliel , the most celebrated Rabbi of his time , from setting out as eager but pacific controversialist in public dispute against the preachers of the Gospel , changes into a virulent , bloody persecutor of Christians , and ends by abruptly becoming himself a Christian and a teacher of Christianity . THE EPIC OF SAUL tells the story of this . “ It is the great success of the poem , ” says Prof. John A. Paine , “ to put the reader in the place of those who opposed the rising and rapidly spreading faith in Jesus , and to unfold a marvellous insight into the reasonings , motives , intrigues , and action of those actually engaged in trying to suppress the new movement ; and thus , it helps to form a remarkably vivid conception of the crisis , and to gain a deeper understanding of the conflict . ” “ Saul in the Council Stephen 's face saw shine As it had been an angel 's , but his heart To the august theophany was blind — Blinded by hatred of the fervent saint , And hatred of the Lord who in him shone , What blindfold hatred such could work of ill In nature meant for utter nobleness , Then how the hatred could to love be turned , The proud wrong will to lowly right be brought , And Paul the ‘ servant ’ spring from rebel Saul — This , ye who love in man the good and fair , And joy to hail retrieved the good and fair — From the unfair and evil , hearken all And speed me with your wishes while I sing . ” — — From the Proem . APPRECIATIVE CRITICISMS . “ Decidedly impressive and attractive .... One never wants to lay the book down , and reads it through with increasing , rather than flagging interest . ” — THE SPECTATOR , London . “ Dr. Wilkinson 's Epic of Saul is daring in conception , subtle in analysis , exquisite in delineation , stately in movement , dramatic in unfolding , rythmical in expression , reverent in tone , uplifting in tendency . The Poem of Saul is as truly an epic as Milton 's Paradise Lost . ” — REV . GEORGE DANA BOARDMAN , D. D . 8vo , Cloth , Gilt top , 386 pp . Price , $ 1. 50 , post-free . “ Epic of Saul , ” and “ Epic of Paul ” together , $ 3. 00 . FUNK &amp; WAGNALLS COMPANY , Publishers , New York</p>
