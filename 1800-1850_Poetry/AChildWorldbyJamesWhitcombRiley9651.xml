    <docTitle><titlePart>A CHILD-WORLD James Whitcomb Riley A CHILD-WORLD The Child-World — long and long since lost to view — A Fairy Paradise !— How always fair it was and fresh and new — How every affluent hour heaped heart and eyes With treasures of surprise ! Enchantments tangible : The under-brink Of dawns that launched the sight Up seas of gold : The dewdrop on the pink , With all the green earth in it and blue height Of heavens infinite : The liquid , dripping songs of orchard-birds — The wee bass of the bees ,— With lucent deeps of silence afterwards ; The gay , clandestine whisperings of the breeze And glad leaves of the trees . O Child-World : After this world — just as when I found you first sufficed My soulmost need — if I found you again , With all my childish dream so realised , I should not be surprised .</titlePart></docTitle>

    <docTitle><titlePart>THE CHILD-WORLD A Child-World , yet a wondrous world no less , To those who knew its boundless happiness . A simple old frame house — eight rooms in all — Set just one side the center of a small But very hopeful Indiana town ,— The upper-story looking squarely down Upon the main street , and the main highway From East to West ,— historic in its day , Known as The National Road — old-timers , all Who linger yet , will happily recall It as the scheme and handiwork , as well As property , of “ Uncle Sam , ” and tell Of its importance , “ long and long afore Railroads wuz ever dreamp ’ of ! ” — Furthermore , The reminiscent first Inhabitants Will make that old road blossom with romance Of snowy caravans , in long parade Of covered vehicles , of every grade From ox-cart of most primitive design , To Conestoga wagons , with their fine Deep-chested six-horse teams , in heavy gear , High names and chiming bells — to childish ear And eye entrancing as the glittering train Of some sun-smitten pageant of old Spain . And , in like spirit , haply they will tell You of the roadside forests , and the yell Of “ wolfs ” and “ painters , ” in the long night-ride , And “ screechin ’ catamounts ” on every side .— Of stagecoach-days , highwaymen , and strange crimes , And yet unriddled mysteries of the times Called “ Good Old . ” “ And why ‘ Good Old ’ ? ” once a rare Old chronicler was asked , who brushed the hair Out of his twinkling eyes and said ,— “ Well John , They 're ‘ good old times ’ because they 're dead and gone ! ” The old home site was portioned into three Distinctive lots . The front one — natively Facing to southward , broad and gaudy-fine With lilac , dahlia , rose , and flowering vine — The dwelling stood in ; and behind that , and Upon the alley north and south , left hand , The old wood-house ,— half , trimly stacked with wood , And half , a work-shop , where a workbench stood Steadfastly through all seasons .— Over it , Along the wall , hung compass , brace-and-bit , And square , and drawing-knife , and smoothing-plane — And little jack-plane , too — the children 's vain Possession by pretense — in fancy they Manipulating it in endless play , Turning out countless curls and loops of bright , Fine satin shavings — Rapture infinite ! Shelved quilting-frames ; the toolchest ; the old box Of refuse nails and screws ; a rough gun-stock 's Outline in “ curly maple ” ; and a pair Of clamps and old krout-cutter hanging there . Some “ patterns , ” in thin wood , of shield and scroll , Hung higher , with a neat “ cane-fishing-pole ” And careful tackle — all securely out Of reach of children , rummaging about . Beside the wood-house , with broad branches free Yet close above the roof , an apple-tree Known as “ The Prince 's Harvest ” — Magic phrase ! That was a boy 's own tree , in many ways !— Its girth and height meet both for the caress Of his bare legs and his ambitiousness : And then its apples , humoring his whim , Seemed just to fairly hurry ripe for him — Even in June , impetuous as he , They dropped to meet him , halfway up the tree . And O their bruised sweet faces where they fell !— And ho ! the lips that feigned to “ kiss them well ” ! “ The Old Sweet-Apple-Tree , ” a stalwart , stood In fairly sympathetic neighborhood Of this wild princeling with his early gold To toss about so lavishly nor hold In bounteous hoard to overbrim at once All Nature 's lap when came the Autumn months . Under the spacious shade of this the eyes Of swinging children saw swift-changing skies Of blue and green , with sunshine shot between , And “ when the old cat died ” they saw but green . And , then , there was a cherry-tree .— We all And severally will yet recall From our lost youth , in gentlest memory , The blessed fact — There was a cherry-tree . There was a cherry-tree . Its bloomy snows Cool even now the fevered sight that knows No more its airy visions of pure joy — As when you were a boy . There was a cherry-tree . The Bluejay set His blue against its white — O blue as jet He seemed there then !— But now — Whoever knew He was so pale a blue ! There was a cherry-tree — Our child-eyes saw The miracle :— Its pure white snows did thaw Into a crimson fruitage , far too sweet But for a boy to eat . There was a cherry-tree , give thanks and joy !— There was a bloom of snow — There was a boy — There was a Bluejay of the realest blue — And fruit for both of you . Then the old garden , with the apple-trees Grouped ‘ round the margin , and “ a stand of bees ” By the “ white-winter-pearmain ” ; and a row Of currant-bushes ; and a quince or so . The old grape-arbor in the center , by The pathway to the stable , with the sty Behind it , and upon it , cootering flocks Of pigeons , and the cutest “ martin-box ” !— Made like a sure-enough house — with roof , and doors And windows in it , and veranda-floors And balusters all ‘ round it — yes , and at Each end a chimney — painted red at that And penciled white , to look like little bricks ; And , to cap all the builder 's cunning tricks , Two tiny little lightning-rods were run Straight up their sides , and twinkled in the sun . Who built it ? Nay , no answer but a smile .— It may be you can guess who , afterwhile . Home in his stall , “ Old Sorrel ” munched his hay And oats and corn , and switched the flies away , In a repose of patience good to see , And earnest of the gentlest pedigree . With half pathetic eye sometimes he gazed Upon the gambols of a colt that grazed Around the edges of the lot outside , And kicked at nothing suddenly , and tried To act grown-up and graceful and high-bred , But dropped , k'whop ! and scraped the buggy-shed , Leaving a tuft of woolly , foxy hair Under the sharp-end of a gate-hinge there . Then , all ignobly scrambling to his feet And whinneying a whinney like a bleat , He would pursue himself around the lot And — do the whole thing over , like as not !... Ah ! what a life of constant fear and dread And flop and squawk and flight the chickens led ! Above the fences , either side , were seen The neighbor-houses , set in plots of green Dooryards and greener gardens , tree and wall Alike whitewashed , and order in it all : The scythe hooked in the tree-fork ; and the spade And hoe and rake and shovel all , when laid Aside , were in their places , ready for The hand of either the possessor or Of any neighbor , welcome to the loan Of any tool he might not chance to own .</titlePart></docTitle>

   <head>THE OLD-HOME FOLKS</head>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Such was the Child-World of the long-ago —</l>
     <l n="3">The little world these children used to know :—</l>
     <l n="4">Johnty , the oldest , and the best , perhaps ,</l>
     <l n="5">Of the five happy little Hoosier chaps</l>
     <l n="6">Inhabiting this wee world all their own .—</l>
     <l n="7">Johnty , the leader , with his native tone</l>
     <l n="8">Of grave command — a general on parade</l>
     <l n="9">Whose each punctilious order was obeyed</l>
     <l n="10">By his proud followers .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="11">But Johnty yet —</l>
     <l n="12">After all serious duties — could forget</l>
     <l n="13">The gravity of life to the extent ,</l>
     <l n="14">At times , of kindling much astonishment</l>
     <l n="15">About him : With a quick , observant eye ,</l>
     <l n="16">And mind and memory , he could supply</l>
     <l n="17">The tamest incident with liveliest mirth ;</l>
     <l n="18">And at the most unlooked-for times on earth</l>
     <l n="19">Was wont to break into some travesty</l>
     <l n="20">On those around him — feats of mimicry</l>
     <l n="21">Of this one 's trick of gesture — that one 's walk —</l>
     <l n="22">Or this one 's laugh — or that one 's funny talk ,—</l>
     <l n="23">The way “ the watermelon-man ” would try</l>
     <l n="24">His humor on town-folks that would n't buy ;—</l>
     <l n="25">How he drove into town at morning — then</l>
     <l n="26">At dusk ( alas ! ) how he drove out again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="27">Though these divertisements of Johnty 's were</l>
     <l n="28">Hailed with a hearty glee and relish , there</l>
     <l n="29">Appeared a sense , on his part , of regret —</l>
     <l n="30">A spirit of remorse that would not let</l>
     <l n="31">Him rest for days thereafter .— Such times he ,</l>
     <l n="32">As some boy said , “ jist got too overly</l>
     <l n="33">Blame good fer common boys like us , you know ,</l>
     <l n="34">To ‘ sociate with — less'n we ‘ ud go</l>
     <l n="35">And jine his church ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="36">Next after Johnty came</l>
     <l n="37">His little tow-head brother , Bud by name .—</l>
     <l n="38">And O how white his hair was — and how thick</l>
     <l n="39">His face with freckles ,— and his ears , how quick</l>
     <l n="40">And curious and intrusive !— And how pale</l>
     <l n="41">The blue of his big eyes ;— and how a tale</l>
     <l n="42">Of Giants , Trolls or Fairies , bulged them still</l>
     <l n="43">Bigger and bigger !— and when “ Jack ” would kill</l>
     <l n="44">The old “ Four-headed Giant , ” Bud 's big eyes</l>
     <l n="45">Were swollen truly into giant-size .</l>
     <l n="46">And Bud was apt in make-believes — would hear</l>
     <l n="47">His Grandma talk or read , with such an ear</l>
     <l n="48">And memory of both subject and big words ,</l>
     <l n="49">That he would take the book up afterwards</l>
     <l n="50">And feign to “ read aloud , ” with such success</l>
     <l n="51">As caused his truthful elders real distress .</l>
     <l n="52">But he must have big words — they seemed to give</l>
     <l n="53">Extremer range to the superlative —</l>
     <l n="54">That was his passion . “ My Gran'ma , ” he said ,</l>
     <l n="55">One evening , after listening as she read</l>
     <l n="56">Some heavy old historical review —</l>
     <l n="57">With copious explanations thereunto</l>
     <l n="58">Drawn out by his inquiring turn of mind ,—</l>
     <l n="59">“ My Gran'ma she 's read all books — ever ’ kind</l>
     <l n="60">They is , ‘ at tells all ‘ bout the land an ’ sea</l>
     <l n="61">An ’ Nations of the Earth !— An ’ she is the</l>
     <l n="62">Historicul-est woman ever wuz ! ”</l>
     <l n="63">( Forgive the verse 's chuckling as it does</l>
     <l n="64">In its erratic current .— Oftentimes</l>
     <l n="65">The little willowy waterbrook of rhymes</l>
     <l n="66">Must falter in its music , listening to</l>
     <l n="67">The children laughing as they used to do . )</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="68">Who shall sing a simple ditty all about the Willow ,</l>
     <l n="69">Dainty-fine and delicate as any bending spray</l>
     <l n="70">That dandles high the happy bird that flutters there to trill a</l>
     <l n="71">Tremulously tender song of greeting to the May .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="72">Ah , my lovely Willow !— Let the Waters lilt your graces ,—</l>
     <l n="73">They alone with limpid kisses lave your leaves above ,</l>
     <l n="74">Flashing back your sylvan beauty , and in shady places</l>
     <l n="75">Peering up with glimmering pebbles , like the eyes of love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="76">Next , Maymie , with her hazy cloud of hair ,</l>
     <l n="77">And the blue skies of eyes beneath it there .</l>
     <l n="78">Her dignified and “ little lady ” airs</l>
     <l n="79">Of never either romping up the stairs</l>
     <l n="80">Or falling down them ; thoughtful everyway</l>
     <l n="81">Of others first — The kind of child at play</l>
     <l n="82">That “ gave up , ” for the rest , the ripest pear</l>
     <l n="83">Or peach or apple in the garden there</l>
     <l n="84">Beneath the trees where swooped the airy swing —</l>
     <l n="85">She pushing it , too glad for anything !</l>
     <l n="86">Or , in the character of hostess , she</l>
     <l n="87">Would entertain her friends delightfully</l>
     <l n="88">In her play-house ,— with strips of carpet laid</l>
     <l n="89">Along the garden-fence within the shade</l>
     <l n="90">Of the old apple-trees — where from next yard</l>
     <l n="91">Came the two dearest friends in her regard ,</l>
     <l n="92">The little Crawford girls , Ella and Lu —</l>
     <l n="93">As shy and lovely as the lilies grew</l>
     <l n="94">In their idyllic home ,— yet sometimes they</l>
     <l n="95">Admitted Bud and Alex to their play ,</l>
     <l n="96">Who did their heavier work and helped them fix</l>
     <l n="97">To have a “ Festibul ” — and brought the bricks</l>
     <l n="98">And built the “ stove , ” with a real fire and all ,</l>
     <l n="99">And stovepipe-joint for chimney , looming tall</l>
     <l n="100">And wonderfully smoky — even to</l>
     <l n="101">Their childish aspirations , as it blew</l>
     <l n="102">And swooped and swirled about them till their sight</l>
     <l n="103">Was feverish even as their high delight .</l>
     <l n="104">Then Alex , with his freckles , and his freaks</l>
     <l n="105">Of temper , and the peach-bloom of his cheeks ,</l>
     <l n="106">And “ amber-colored hair ” — his mother said</l>
     <l n="107">‘ Twas that , when others laughed and called it “ red ”</l>
     <l n="108">And Alex threw things at them — till they 'd call</l>
     <l n="109">A truce , agreeing “ ‘ t'uz  n't red ut-tall ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="110">But Alex was affectionate beyond</l>
     <l n="111">The average child , and was extremely fond</l>
     <l n="112">Of the paternal relatives of his</l>
     <l n="113">Of whom he once made estimate like this :—</l>
     <l n="114">“ I 'm only got two brothers ,— but my Pa</l>
     <l n="115">He 's got most brothers'n you ever saw !—</l>
     <l n="116">He 's got seben brothers !— Yes , an ’ they 're all my</l>
     <l n="117">Seben Uncles !— Uncle John , an ’ Jim ,— an ’ I ’</l>
     <l n="118">Got Uncle George , an ’ Uncle Andy , too ,</l>
     <l n="119">An ’ Uncle Frank , an ’ Uncle Joe .— An ’ you</l>
     <l n="120">Know Uncle Mart .— An ’ , all but him , they 're great</l>
     <l n="121">Big mens !— An ’ nen s Aunt Sarah — she makes eight !—</l>
     <l n="122">I 'm got eight uncles !— ‘ cept Aunt Sarah can n't</l>
     <l n="123">Be ist my uncle ‘ cause she 's ist my aunt ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="124">Then , next to Alex — and the last indeed</l>
     <l n="125">Of these five little ones of whom you read —</l>
     <l n="126">Was baby Lizzie , with her velvet lisp ,—</l>
     <l n="127">As though her Elfin lips had caught some wisp</l>
     <l n="128">Of floss between them as they strove with speech ,</l>
     <l n="129">Which ever seemed just in yet out of reach —</l>
     <l n="130">Though what her lips missed , her dark eyes could say</l>
     <l n="131">With looks that made her meaning clear as day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="132">And , knowing now the children , you must know</l>
     <l n="133">The father and the mother they loved so :—</l>
     <l n="134">The father was a swarthy man , black-eyed ,</l>
     <l n="135">Black-haired , and high of forehead ; and , beside</l>
     <l n="136">The slender little mother , seemed in truth</l>
     <l n="137">A very king of men — since , from his youth ,</l>
     <l n="138">To his hale manhood now — ( worthy as then ,—</l>
     <l n="139">A lawyer and a leading citizen</l>
     <l n="140">Of the proud little town and county-seat —</l>
     <l n="141">His hopes his neighbors ’ , and their fealty sweet ) —</l>
     <l n="142">He had known outdoor labor — rain and shine —</l>
     <l n="143">Bleak Winter , and bland Summer — foul and fine .</l>
     <l n="144">So Nature had ennobled him and set</l>
     <l n="145">Her symbol on him like a coronet :</l>
     <l n="146">His lifted brow , and frank , reliant face .—</l>
     <l n="147">Superior of stature as of grace ,</l>
     <l n="148">Even the children by the spell were wrought</l>
     <l n="149">Up to heroics of their simple thought ,</l>
     <l n="150">And saw him , trim of build , and lithe and straight</l>
     <l n="151">And tall , almost , as at the pasture-gate</l>
     <l n="152">The towering ironweed the scythe had spared</l>
     <l n="153">For their sakes , when The Hired Man declared</l>
     <l n="154">It would grow on till it became a tree ,</l>
     <l n="155">With cocoanuts and monkeys in — maybe !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="156">Yet , though the children , in their pride and awe</l>
     <l n="157">And admiration of the father , saw</l>
     <l n="158">A being so exalted — even more</l>
     <l n="159">Like adoration was the love they bore</l>
     <l n="160">The gentle mother .— Her mild , plaintive face</l>
     <l n="161">Was purely fair , and haloed with a grace</l>
     <l n="162">And sweetness luminous when joy made glad</l>
     <l n="163">Her features with a smile ; or saintly sad</l>
     <l n="164">As twilight , fell the sympathetic gloom</l>
     <l n="165">Of any childish grief , or as a room</l>
     <l n="166">Were darkened suddenly , the curtain drawn</l>
     <l n="167">Across the window and the sunshine gone .</l>
     <l n="168">Her brow , below her fair hair 's glimmering strands ,</l>
     <l n="169">Seemed meetest resting-place for blessing hands</l>
     <l n="170">Or holiest touches of soft finger-tips</l>

     <l n="4">With their all-varying looks of pleased surprise</l>
     <l n="5">And joyous interest in flower and tree ,</l>

     <l n="119">A wholesome interest that made him quite</l>

     <l n="125">And , cumbrous though he seemed , both eye and hand</l>
     <l n="126">Were dowered with the discernment and deft skill</l>

     <l n="129">Little toy-wagons , and curved-runner sleighs ;</l>

     <l n="131">Of “ seasoned timber , ” such as Noey knew</l>
     <l n="132">How to select , prepare , and then complete ,</l>
     <l n="133">And call his little friends in from the street .</l>
     <l n="134">“ The very best bow , ” Noey used to say ,</l>

     <l n="188">Big as a child 's : And , childlike otherwise ,</l>

     <l n="203">Afar she hailed his coming , as she heard</l>
     <l n="204">His tuneless whistling — sweet as any bird</l>
     <l n="205">It seemed to her , the one lame bar or so</l>
     <l n="206">Of old “ Wait for the Wagon ” — hoarse and low</l>
     <l n="207">The sound was ,— so that , all about the place ,</l>
     <l n="208">Folks joked and said that Noey “ whistled bass ” —</l>
     <l n="209">The light remark originally made</l>
     <l n="210">By Cousin Rufus , who knew notes , and played</l>
     <l n="211">The flute with nimble skill , and taste as wall ,</l>
     <l n="212">And , critical as he was musical ,</l>
     <l n="213">Regarded Noey 's constant whistling thus</l>
     <l n="214">“ Phenominally unmelodious . ”</l>
     <l n="215">Likewise when Uncle Mart , who shared the love</l>
     <l n="216">Of jest with Cousin Rufus hand-in-glove ,</l>
     <l n="217">Said “ Noey could n't whistle ‘ Bonny Doon ’</l>

     <l n="225">Particularly lovable because</l>
     <l n="226">He laid the woodland 's harvest at her feet .—</l>
     <l n="227">He brought her wild strawberries , honey-sweet</l>
     <l n="228">And dewy-cool , in mats of greenest moss</l>
     <l n="229">And leaves , all woven over and across</l>

     <l n="236">With Noey 's rare resources : Still the same</l>
     <l n="237">He blithely whistled through the snow and came</l>

    <p>A PROSPECTIVE VISIT</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="327">While any day was notable and dear</l>
     <l n="328">That gave the children Noey , history here</l>
     <l n="329">Records his advent emphasized indeed</l>
     <l n="330">With sharp italics , as he came to feed</l>
     <l n="331">The stock one special morning , fair and bright ,</l>
     <l n="332">When Johnty and Bud met him , with delight</l>
     <l n="333">Unusual even as their extra dress —</l>
     <l n="334">Garbed as for holiday , with much excess</l>
     <l n="335">Of proud self-consciousness and vain conceit</l>
     <l n="336">In their new finery .— Far up the street</l>
     <l n="337">They called to Noey , as he came , that they ,</l>
     <l n="338">As promised , both were going back that day</l>
     <l n="339">To his house with him !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="340">And by time that each</l>
     <l n="341">Had one of Noey 's hands — ceasing their speech</l>
     <l n="342">And coyly anxious , in their new attire ,</l>
     <l n="343">To wake the comment of their mute desire ,—</l>
     <l n="344">Noey seemed rendered voiceless . Quite a while</l>
     <l n="345">They watched him furtively .— He seemed to smile</l>
     <l n="346">As though he would conceal it ; and they saw</l>
     <l n="347">Him look away , and his lips purse and draw</l>
     <l n="348">In curious , twitching spasms , as though he might</l>
     <l n="349">Be whispering ,— while in his eye the white</l>
     <l n="350">Predominated strangely .— Then the spell</l>
     <l n="351">Gave way , and his pent speech burst audible :</l>
     <l n="352">“ They wuz two stylish little boys ,</l>
     <l n="353">and they wuz mighty bold ones ,</l>
     <l n="354">Had two new pairs o ’ britches made</l>
     <l n="355">out o ’ their daddy 's old ones ! ”</l>
     <l n="356">And at the inspirational outbreak ,</l>
     <l n="357">Both joker and his victims seemed to take</l>
     <l n="358">An equal share of laughter ,— and all through</l>
     <l n="359">Their morning visit kept recurring to</l>
     <l n="360">The funny words and jingle of the rhyme</l>
     <l n="361">That just kept getting funnier all the time .</l>

    <p>AT NOEY 'S HOUSE</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="362">At Noey 's house — when they arrived with him —</l>
     <l n="363">How snug seemed everything , and neat and trim :</l>
     <l n="364">The little picket-fence , and little gate —</l>
     <l n="365">It 's little pulley , and its little weight ,—</l>
     <l n="366">All glib as clock-work , as it clicked behind</l>
     <l n="367">Them , on the little red brick pathway , lined</l>
     <l n="368">With little paint-keg-vases and teapots</l>
     <l n="369">Of wee moss-blossoms and forgetmenots :</l>
     <l n="370">And in the windows , either side the door ,</l>
     <l n="371">Were ranged as many little boxes more</l>
     <l n="372">Of like old-fashioned larkspurs , pinks and moss</l>
     <l n="373">And fern and phlox ; while up and down across</l>
     <l n="374">Them rioted the morning-glory-vines</l>
     <l n="375">On taut-set cotton-strings , whose snowy lines</l>
     <l n="376">Whipt in and out and under the bright green</l>
     <l n="377">Like basting-threads ; and , here and there between ,</l>
     <l n="378">A showy , shiny hollyhock would flare</l>
     <l n="379">Its pink among the white and purple there .—</l>
     <l n="380">And still behind the vines , the children saw</l>
     <l n="381">A strange , bleached , wistful face that seemed to draw</l>
     <l n="382">A vague , indefinite sympathy . A face</l>
     <l n="383">It was of some newcomer to the place .—</l>
     <l n="384">In explanation , Noey , briefly , said</l>
     <l n="385">That it was “ Jason , ” as he turned and led</l>
     <l n="386">The little fellows ‘ round the house to show</l>
     <l n="387">Them his menagerie of pets . And so</l>
     <l n="388">For quite a time the face of the strange guest</l>
     <l n="389">Was partially forgotten , as they pressed</l>
     <l n="390">About the squirrel-cage and rousted both</l>
     <l n="391">The lazy inmates out , though wholly loath</l>
     <l n="392">To whirl the wheel for them .— And then with awe</l>
     <l n="393">They walked ‘ round Noey 's big pet owl , and saw</l>
     <l n="394">Him film his great , clear , liquid eyes and stare</l>
     <l n="395">And turn and turn and turn his head ‘ round there</l>
     <l n="396">The same way they kept circling — as though he</l>
     <l n="397">Could turn it one way thus eternally .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="398">Behind the kitchen , then , with special pride</l>
     <l n="399">Noey stirred up a terrapin inside</l>
     <l n="400">The rain-barrel where he lived , with three or four</l>
     <l n="401">Little mud-turtles of a size not more</l>
     <l n="402">In neat circumference than the tiny toy</l>
     <l n="403">Dumb-watches worn by every little boy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="404">Then , back of the old shop , beneath the tree</l>
     <l n="405">Of “ rusty-coats , ” as Noey called them , he</l>
     <l n="406">Next took the boys , to show his favorite new</l>
     <l n="407">Pet ‘ coon — pulled rather coyly into view</l>
     <l n="408">Up through a square hole in the bottom of</l>
     <l n="409">An old inverted tub he bent above ,</l>
     <l n="410">Yanking a little chain , with “ Hey ! you , sir !</l>
     <l n="411">Here 's comp'ny come to see you , Bolivur ! ”</l>
     <l n="412">Explanatory , he went on to say ,</l>
     <l n="413">“ I named him ‘ Bolivur ’ jes thisaway ,—</l>
     <l n="414">He looks so round and ovalish and fat ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="416">Here Noey 's father called and sent him on</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">My little story , Cousin Rufus said ,</l>
     <l n="2">Is not so much a story as a fact .</l>
     <l n="3">It is about a certain willful boy —</l>
     <l n="4">An aggrieved , unappreciated boy ,</l>
     <l n="5">Grown to dislike his own home very much ,</l>
     <l n="6">By reason of his parents being not</l>
     <l n="7">At all up to his rigid standard and</l>
     <l n="8">Requirements and exactions as a son</l>
     <l n="9">And disciplinarian .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">So , sullenly</l>
     <l n="11">He brooded over his disheartening</l>
     <l n="12">Environments and limitations , till ,</l>
     <l n="13">At last , well knowing that the outside world</l>
     <l n="14">Would yield him favors never found at home ,</l>
     <l n="15">He rose determinedly one July dawn —</l>
     <l n="16">Even before the call for breakfast — and ,</l>
     <l n="17">Climbing the alley-fence , and bitterly</l>
     <l n="18">Shaking his clenched fist at the woodpile , he</l>
     <l n="19">Evanished down the turnpike .— Yes : he had ,</l>
     <l n="20">Once and for all , put into execution</l>
     <l n="21">His long low-muttered threatenings — He had</l>
     <l n="22">Run off !— He had — had run away from home !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="23">His parents , at discovery of his flight ,</l>
     <l n="24">Bore up first-rate — especially his Pa ,—</l>
     <l n="25">Quite possibly recalling his own youth ,</l>
     <l n="26">And therefrom predicating , by high noon ,</l>
     <l n="27">The absent one was very probably</l>
     <l n="28">Disporting his nude self in the delights</l>
     <l n="29">Of the old swimmin ’ - hole , some hundred yards</l>
     <l n="30">Below the slaughter-house , just east of town .</l>
     <l n="31">The stoic father , too , in his surmise</l>
     <l n="32">Was accurate — For , lo ! the boy was there !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="33">And there , too , he remained throughout the day —</l>
     <l n="34">Save at one starving interval in which</l>
     <l n="35">He clad his sunburnt shoulders long enough</l>
     <l n="36">To shy across a wheatfield , shadow-like ,</l>
     <l n="37">And raid a neighboring orchard — bitterly ,</l>
     <l n="38">And with spasmodic twitchings of the lip ,</l>
     <l n="39">Bethinking him how all the other boys</l>
     <l n="40">Had homes to go to at the dinner-hour —</l>
     <l n="41">While he — alas !— he had no home !— At least</l>
     <l n="42">These very words seemed rising mockingly ,</l>
     <l n="43">Until his every thought smacked raw and sour</l>
     <l n="44">And green and bitter as the apples he</l>
     <l n="45">In vain essayed to stay his hunger with .</l>
     <l n="46">Nor did he join the glad shouts when the boys</l>
     <l n="47">Returned rejuvenated for the long</l>
     <l n="48">Wet revel of the feverish afternoon .—</l>
     <l n="49">Yet , bravely , as his comrades splashed and swam</l>
     <l n="50">And spluttered , in their weltering merriment ,</l>
     <l n="51">He tried to laugh , too ,— but his voice was hoarse</l>
     <l n="52">And sounded to him like some other boy 's .</l>
     <l n="53">And then he felt a sudden , poking sort</l>
     <l n="54">Of sickness at the heart , as though some cold</l>
     <l n="55">And scaly pain were blindly nosing it</l>
     <l n="56">Down in the dreggy darkness of his breast .</l>
     <l n="57">The tensioned pucker of his purple lips</l>
     <l n="58">Grew ever chillier and yet more tense —</l>
     <l n="59">The central hurt of it slow spreading till</l>
     <l n="60">It did possess the little face entire .</l>
     <l n="61">And then there grew to be a knuckled knot —</l>
     <l n="62">An aching kind of core within his throat —</l>
     <l n="63">An ache , all dry and swallowless , which seemed</l>
     <l n="64">To ache on just as bad when he 'd pretend</l>
     <l n="65">He did n't notice it as when he did .</l>
     <l n="66">It was a kind of a conceited pain —</l>
     <l n="67">An overbearing , self-assertive and</l>
     <l n="68">Barbaric sort of pain that clean outhurt</l>
     <l n="69">A boy 's capacity for suffering —</l>
     <l n="70">So , many times , the little martyr needs</l>
     <l n="71">Must turn himself all suddenly and dive</l>
     <l n="72">From sight of his hilarious playmates and</l>
     <l n="73">Surreptitiously weep under water .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="74">Thus</l>
     <l n="75">He wrestled with his awful agony</l>
     <l n="76">Till almost dark ; and then , at last — then , with</l>
     <l n="77">The very latest lingering group of his</l>
     <l n="78">Companions , he moved turgidly toward home —</l>
     <l n="79">Nay , rather oozed that way , so slow he went ,—</l>
     <l n="80">With lothful , hesitating , loitering ,</l>
     <l n="81">Reluctant , late-election-returns air ,</l>
     <l n="82">Heightened somewhat by the conscience-made resolve</l>
     <l n="83">Of chopping a double-armful of wood</l>
     <l n="84">As he went in by rear way of the kitchen .</l>
     <l n="85">And this resolve he executed ;— yet</l>
     <l n="86">The hired girl made no comment whatsoever ,</l>
     <l n="87">But went on washing up the supper-things ,</l>
     <l n="88">Crooning the unutterably sad song , “ Then think ,</l>
     <l n="89">Oh , think how lonely this heart must ever be ! ”</l>
     <l n="90">Still , with affected carelessness , the boy</l>
     <l n="91">Ranged through the pantry ; but the cupboard-door</l>
     <l n="92">Was locked . He sighed then like a wet fore-stick</l>
     <l n="93">And went out on the porch .— At least the pump ,</l>
     <l n="94">He prophesied , would meet him kindly and</l>
     <l n="95">Shake hands with him and welcome his return !</l>
     <l n="96">And long he held the old tin dipper up —</l>
     <l n="97">And oh , how fresh and pure and sweet the draught !</l>
     <l n="98">Over the upturned brim , with grateful eyes</l>
     <l n="99">He saw the back-yard , in the gathering night ,</l>
     <l n="100">Vague , dim and lonesome , but it all looked good :</l>
     <l n="101">The lightning-bugs , against the grape-vines , blinked</l>
     <l n="102">A sort of sallow gladness over his</l>
     <l n="103">Home-coming , with this softening of the heart .</l>
     <l n="104">He did not leave the dipper carelessly</l>
     <l n="105">In the milk-trough .— No : he hung it back upon</l>
     <l n="106">Its old nail thoughtfully — even tenderly .</l>
     <l n="107">All slowly then he turned and sauntered toward</l>
     <l n="108">The rain-barrel at the corner of the house ,</l>
     <l n="109">And , pausing , peered into it at the few</l>
     <l n="110">Faint stars reflected there . Then — moved by some</l>
     <l n="111">Strange impulse new to him — he washed his feet .</l>
     <l n="112">He then went in the house — straight on into</l>
     <l n="113">The very room where sat his parents by</l>
     <l n="114">The evening lamp .— The father all intent</l>
     <l n="115">Reading his paper , and the mother quite</l>
     <l n="116">As intent with her sewing . Neither looked</l>
     <l n="117">Up at his entrance — even reproachfully ,—</l>
     <l n="118">And neither spoke .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="119">The wistful runaway</l>
     <l n="120">Drew a long , quavering breath , and then sat down</l>
     <l n="121">Upon the extreme edge of a chair . And all</l>
     <l n="122">Was very still there for a long , long while .—</l>
     <l n="123">Yet everything , someway , seemed restful-like</l>
     <l n="124">And homey and old-fashioned , good and kind ,</l>
     <l n="125">And sort of kin to him !— Only too still !</l>
     <l n="126">If somebody would say something — just speak —</l>
     <l n="127">Or even rise up suddenly and come</l>
     <l n="128">And lift him by the ear sheer off his chair —</l>
     <l n="129">Or box his jaws — Lord bless ‘ em !— anything !—</l>
     <l n="130">Was he not there to thankfully accept</l>
     <l n="131">Any reception from parental source</l>
     <l n="132">Save this incomprehensible voicelessness .</l>
     <l n="133">O but the silence held its very breath !</l>
     <l n="134">If but the ticking clock would only strike</l>
     <l n="135">And for an instant drown the whispering ,</l>
     <l n="136">Lisping , sifting sound the katydids</l>
     <l n="137">Made outside in the grassy nowhere .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="138">Far</l>
     <l n="139">Down some back-street he heard the faint halloo</l>
     <l n="140">Of boys at their night-game of “ Town-fox , ”</l>
     <l n="141">But now with no desire at all to be</l>
     <l n="142">Participating in their sport — No ; no ;—</l>
     <l n="143">Never again in this world would he want</l>
     <l n="144">To join them there !— he only wanted just</l>
     <l n="145">To stay in home of nights — Always — always —</l>
     <l n="146">Forever and a day !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="147">He moved ; and coughed —</l>
     <l n="148">Coughed hoarsely , too , through his rolled tongue ; and yet</l>
     <l n="149">No vaguest of parental notice or</l>
     <l n="150">Solicitude in answer — no response —</l>
     <l n="151">No word — no look . O it was deathly still !—</l>
     <l n="152">So still it was that really he could not</l>
     <l n="153">Remember any prior silence that</l>
     <l n="154">At all approached it in profundity</l>
     <l n="155">And depth and density of utter hush .</l>
     <l n="156">He felt that he himself must break it : So ,</l>
     <l n="157">Summoning every subtle artifice</l>
     <l n="158">Of seeming nonchalance and native ease</l>
     <l n="159">And naturalness of utterance to his aid ,</l>
     <l n="160">And gazing raptly at the house-cat where</l>
     <l n="161">She lay curled in her wonted corner of</l>
     <l n="162">The hearth-rug , dozing , he spoke airily</l>
     <l n="163">And said : “ I see you 've got the same old cat ! ”</l>

     <l n="10">Him to the shelter of her heart , and praised</l>
     <l n="11">His story in low whisperings , and smoothed</l>

    <head>TOLD BY “ THE NOTED TRAVELER ”</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Coming , clean from the Maryland-end</l>
     <l n="2">Of this great National Road of ours ,</l>
     <l n="3">Through your vast West ; with the time to spend ,</l>
     <l n="4">Stopping for days in the main towns , where</l>
     <l n="5">Every citizen seemed a friend ,</l>
     <l n="6">And friends grew thick as the wayside flowers ,—</l>
     <l n="7">I found no thing that I might narrate</l>
     <l n="8">More singularly strange or queer</l>
     <l n="9">Than a thing I found in your sister-state</l>
     <l n="10">Ohio ,— at a river-town — down here</l>
     <l n="11">In my notebook : Zanesville — situate</l>
     <l n="12">On the stream Muskingum — broad and clear ,</l>
     <l n="13">And navigable , through half the year ,</l>
     <l n="14">North , to Coshocton ; south , as far</l>
     <l n="15">As Marietta .— But these facts are</l>
     <l n="16">Not of the story , but the scene</l>
     <l n="17">Of the simple little tale I mean</l>
     <l n="18">To tell directly — from this , straight through</l>
     <l n="19">To the end that is best worth listening to :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="20">Eastward of Zanesville , two or three</l>
     <l n="21">Miles from the town , as our stage drove in ,</l>
     <l n="22">I on the driver 's seat , and he</l>
     <l n="23">Pointing out this and that to me ,—</l>
     <l n="24">On beyond us — among the rest —</l>
     <l n="25">A grovey slope , and a fluttering throng</l>
     <l n="26">Of little children , which he “ guessed ”</l>
     <l n="27">Was a picnic , as we caught their thin</l>
     <l n="28">High laughter , as we drove along ,</l>
     <l n="29">Clearer and clearer . Then suddenly</l>
     <l n="30">He turned and asked , with a curious grin ,</l>
     <l n="31">What were my views on Slavery ? “ Why ? ”</l>
     <l n="32">I asked , in return , with a wary eye .</l>
     <l n="33">“ Because , ” he answered , pointing his whip</l>
     <l n="34">At a little , whitewashed house and shed</l>
     <l n="35">On the edge of the road by the grove ahead ,—</l>
     <l n="36">“ Because there are two slaves there , ” he said —</l>
     <l n="37">“ Two Black slaves that I 've passed each trip</l>
     <l n="38">For eighteen years .— Though they 've been set free ,</l>
     <l n="39">They have been slaves ever since ! ” said he .</l>
     <l n="40">And , as our horses slowly drew</l>
     <l n="41">Nearer the little house in view ,</l>
     <l n="42">All briefly I heard the history</l>
     <l n="43">Of this little old Negro woman and</l>
     <l n="44">Her husband , house and scrap of land ;</l>
     <l n="45">How they were slaves and had been made free</l>
     <l n="46">By their dying master , years ago</l>
     <l n="47">In old Virginia ; and then had come</l>
     <l n="48">North here into a free state — so ,</l>
     <l n="49">Safe forever , to found a home —</l>
     <l n="50">For themselves alone ?— for they left South there</l>
     <l n="51">Five strong sons , who had , alas !</l>
     <l n="52">All been sold ere it came to pass</l>
     <l n="53">This first old master with his last breath</l>
     <l n="54">Had freed the parents .— ( He went to death</l>
     <l n="55">Agonized and in dire despair</l>
     <l n="56">That the poor slave children might not share</l>
     <l n="57">Their parents ’ freedom . And wildly then</l>
     <l n="58">He moaned for pardon and died . Amen ! )</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="59">Thus , with their freedom , and little sum</l>
     <l n="60">Of money left them , these two had come</l>
     <l n="61">North , full twenty long years ago ;</l>
     <l n="62">And , settling there , they had hopefully</l>
     <l n="63">Gone to work , in their simple way ,</l>
     <l n="64">Hauling — gardening — raising sweet</l>
     <l n="65">Corn , and popcorn .— Bird and bee</l>
     <l n="66">In the garden-blooms and the apple-tree</l>
     <l n="67">Singing with them throughout the slow</l>
     <l n="68">Summer 's day , with its dust and heat —</l>
     <l n="69">The crops that thirst and the rains that fail ;</l>
     <l n="70">Or in Autumn chill , when the clouds hung low ,</l>
     <l n="71">And hand-made hominy might find sale</l>
     <l n="72">In the near town-market ; or baking pies</l>
     <l n="73">And cakes , to range in alluring show</l>
     <l n="74">At the little window , where the eyes</l>
     <l n="75">Of the Movers ’ children , driving past ,</l>
     <l n="76">Grew fixed , till the big white wagons drew</l>
     <l n="77">Into a halt that would sometimes last</l>
     <l n="78">Even the space of an hour or two —</l>
     <l n="79">As the dusty , thirsty travelers made</l>
     <l n="80">Their noonings there in the beeches ’ shade</l>
     <l n="81">By the old black Aunty 's spring-house , where ,</l>
     <l n="82">Along with its cooling draughts , were found</l>
     <l n="83">Jugs of her famous sweet spruce-beer ,</l>
     <l n="84">Served with her gingerbread-horses there ,</l>
     <l n="85">While Aunty 's snow-white cap bobbed ‘ round</l>
     <l n="86">Till the children 's rapture knew no bound ,</l>
     <l n="87">As she sang and danced for them , quavering clear</l>
     <l n="88">And high the chant of her old slave-days —</l>

     <l n="185">Of clear spring-water , pure and cold ,</l>
     <l n="186">And passed it to me : And I raised my hat</l>
     <l n="187">And drank to her with a reverence that</l>
     <l n="188">My conscience knew was justly due</l>
     <l n="189">The old black face , and the old eyes , too —</l>
     <l n="190">The old black head , with its mossy mat</l>
     <l n="191">Of hair , set under its cap and frills</l>
     <l n="192">White as the snows on Alpine hills ;</l>
     <l n="193">Drank to the old black smile , but yet</l>
     <l n="194">Bright as the sun on the violet ,—</l>
     <l n="195">Drank to the gnarled and knuckled old</l>
     <l n="196">Black hands whose palms had ached and bled</l>
     <l n="197">And pitilessly been worn pale</l>
     <l n="198">And white almost as the palms that hold</l>
     <l n="199">Slavery 's lash while the victim 's wail</l>
     <l n="200">Fails as a crippled prayer might fail .—</l>
     <l n="201">Aye , with a reverence infinite ,</l>
     <l n="202">I drank to the old black face and head —</l>
     <l n="203">The old black breast with its life of light —</l>
     <l n="204">The old black hide with its heart of gold .</l>

     <l n="122">And there , in that ripe Summer-night , once more</l>
     <l n="123">A wintry coolness through the open door</l>

     <l n="125">Refreshingly ; and , for a fleeting space ,</l>
     <l n="126">The quickened fancy , through the fragrant air ,</l>

     <l n="130">Thus Uncle Mart 's old poem sounded young</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="138">The poet turned to whisperingly confer</l>
     <l n="139">A moment with “ The Noted Traveler . ”</l>

     <l n="141">An instant later reappeared again ,</l>

     <l n="148">To test it there — especially to show</l>
     <l n="149">The Children . “ It is empty now , you know . ” —</l>
     <l n="150">He humped it with his knuckles , so they heard</l>

     <l n="158">And then a little , squeaky voice came back ,—</l>

     <l n="161">Then the Traveler leisurely</l>

     <l n="164">It , was n't any longer than a pin :</l>
     <l n="165">And this at last he managed to fit in</l>

     <l n="174">His face against the box and had to frown .—</l>
     <l n="175">“ Come , sir ! ” he called ,— “ no impudence to me !—</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="177">“ Open the drawer and see ! ”</l>

     <l n="187">“ Well , then , ” the man said , as he closed the drawer</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="193">And , sure enough ,</l>
     <l n="194">He drew it out , filled with the cotton stuff .</l>

     <l n="213">He smiled</l>
     <l n="214">Half sadly , as it seemed , to see the child</l>
     <l n="215">Open his cap first to his mother ..... There</l>
     <l n="216">Was not a ribbon in it anywhere !</l>
     <l n="217">“ Jack Janitor ! ” the man said sternly through</l>
     <l n="218">The Magic Box — “ Jack Janitor , did you</l>
     <l n="219">Conceal those ribbons anywhere ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="220">“ Well , yes , ”</l>
     <l n="221">The little voice piped — “ but you 'd never guess</l>
     <l n="222">The place I hid ‘ em if you 'd guess a year ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="223">“ Well , wo n't you tell me ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="224">“ Not until you clear</l>
     <l n="225">Your mean old conscience ” said the voice , “ and make</l>
     <l n="226">Me first do something for the Children 's sake . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="227">“ Well , then , fill up the drawer , ” the Traveler said ,</l>
     <l n="228">“ With whitest white on earth and reddest red !—</l>
     <l n="229">Your terms accepted — Are you satisfied ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="230">“ Open the drawer and see ! ” the voice replied .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="231">“ Why , bless my soul ! ” — the man said , as he drew</l>
     <l n="232">The contents of the drawer into view —</l>
     <l n="233">“ It 's level-full of candy !— Pass it ‘ round —</l>
     <l n="234">Jack Janitor sha n't steal that , I 'll be bound ! ” —</l>
     <l n="235">He raised and crunched a stick of it and smacked</l>
     <l n="236">His lips .— “ Yes , that is candy , for a fact !—</l>
     <l n="237">And it 's all yours ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="238">And how the children there</l>
     <l n="239">Lit into it !— O never anywhere</l>
     <l n="240">Was such a feast of sweetness !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="30">
     <l n="241">“ And now , then , ”</l>
     <l n="242">The man said , as the empty drawer again</l>
     <l n="243">Slid to its place , he bending over it ,—</l>
     <l n="244">“ Now , then , Jack Janitor , before we quit</l>
     <l n="245">Our entertainment for the evening , tell</l>
     <l n="246">Us where you hid the ribbons — can n't you ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="31">
     <l n="247">“ Well , ”</l>
     <l n="248">The squeaky little voice drawled sleepily —</l>
     <l n="249">“ Under your old hat , maybe .— Look and see ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="32">
     <l n="250">All carefully the man took off his hat :</l>
     <l n="251">But there was not a ribbon under that .—</l>
     <l n="252">He shook his heavy hair , and all in vain</l>
     <l n="253">The old white hat — then put it on again :</l>
     <l n="254">“ Now , tell me , honest , Jack , where did you hide</l>
     <l n="255">The ribbons ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="33">
     <l n="256">“ Under your hat ” the voice replied .—</l>
     <l n="257">“ Mind ! I said ‘ under ’ and not ‘ in ’ it .— Wo n't</l>
     <l n="258">You ever take the hint on earth ?— or do n't</l>
     <l n="259">You want to show folks where the ribbons at ?—</l>
     <l n="260">Law ! but I 'm sleepy !— Under — unner your hat ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="34">
     <l n="261">Again the old man carefully took off</l>
     <l n="262">The empty hat , with an embarrassed cough ,</l>
     <l n="263">Saying , all gravely to the children : “ You</l>
     <l n="264">Must promise not to laugh — you 'll all want to —</l>
     <l n="265">When you see where Jack Janitor has dared</l>
     <l n="266">To hide those ribbons — when he might have spared</l>
     <l n="267">My feelings .— But no matter !— Know the worst —</l>
     <l n="268">Here are the ribbons , as I feared at first . ” —</l>
     <l n="269">And , quick as snap of thumb and finger , there</l>
     <l n="270">The old man 's head had not a sign of hair ,</l>
     <l n="271">And in his lap a wig of iron-gray</l>
     <l n="272">Lay , stuffed with all that glittering array</l>
     <l n="273">Of ribbons ... “ Take ‘ em to the ladies — Yes .</l>
     <l n="274">Good-night to everybody , and God bless</l>
     <l n="275">The Children . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="35">
     <l n="276">In a whisper no one missed</l>
     <l n="277">The Hired Man yawned : “ He 's a vantrilloquist ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="36">
     <l n="278">So gloried all the night Each trundle-bed</l>
     <l n="279">And pallet was enchanted — each child-head</l>
     <l n="280">Was packed with happy dreams . And long before</l>
     <l n="281">The dawn 's first far-off rooster crowed , the snore</l>
     <l n="282">Of Uncle Mart was stilled , as round him pressed</l>
     <l n="283">The bare arms of the wakeful little guest</l>
     <l n="284">That he had carried home with him ....</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="37">
     <l n="285">“ I think , ”</l>
     <l n="286">An awed voice said — “ ( No : I do n't want a dwink .—</l>
     <l n="287">Lay still . ) — I think ‘ The Noted Traveler ’ he</l>
     <l n="288">‘ S the inscrutibul-est man I ever see ! ”</l>
