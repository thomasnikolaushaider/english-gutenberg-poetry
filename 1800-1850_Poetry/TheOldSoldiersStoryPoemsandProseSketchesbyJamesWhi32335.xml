    <docImprint>AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW<country>ENGLAND</country>SOCIETY IN<settlement>NEW YORK</settlement>CITY Since we have had no stories to-night I will venture , Mr. President , to tell a story that I have heretofore heard at nearly all the banquets I have ever attended . It is a story simply , and you must bear with it kindly . It is a story as told by a friend of us all , who is found in all parts of all countries , who is immoderately fond of a funny story , and who , unfortunately , attempts to tell a funny story himself — one that he has been particularly delighted with . Well , he is not a story-teller , and especially he is not a funny story-teller . His funny stories , indeed , are oftentimes touchingly pathetic . But to such a story as he tells , being a good-natured man and kindly disposed , we have to listen , because we do not want to wound his feelings by telling him that we have heard that story a great number of times , and that we have heard it ably told by a great number of people from the time we were children . But , as I say , we can not hurt his feelings . We can not stop him . We can not kill him ; and so the story generally proceeds . He selects a very old story always , and generally tells it in about this fashion :— I heerd an awful funny thing the other day — ha ! ha ! I do n't know whether I kin git it off er not , but , anyhow , I 'll tell it to you . Well !— le 's see now how the fool-thing goes . Oh , yes !— W'y , there was a feller one time — it was durin ’ the army , and this feller that I started in to tell you about was in the war , and — ha ! ha !— there was a big fight a-goin ’ on , and this feller was in the fight , and it was a big battle and bullets a-flyin ’ ever ’ which way , and bombshells a-bu'stin ’ , and cannon-balls a-flyin ’ ‘ round promiskus ; and this feller right in the midst of it , you know , and all excited and het up , and chargin ’ away ; and the fust thing you know along come a cannon-ball and shot his head off — ha ! ha ! ha ! Hold on here a minute !— no sir ; I 'm a-gittin ’ ahead of my story ; no , no ; it did n't shoot his head off — I 'm gittin ’ the cart before the horse there — shot his leg off ; that was the way ; shot his leg off ; and down the poor feller drapped , and , of course , in that condition was perfectly he'pless , you know , but yit with presence o ’ mind enough to know that he was in a dangerous condition ef somepin ’ was n't done fer him right away . So he seen a comrade a-chargin ’ by that he knowed , and he hollers to him and called him by name — I disremember now what the feller 's name was .... Well , that 's got nothin ’ to do with the story , anyway ; he hollers to him , he did , and says , “ Hello , there , ” he says to him ; “ here , I want you to come here and give me a lift ; I got my leg shot off , and I want you to pack me back to the rear of the battle ” — where the doctors always is , you know , during a fight — and he says , “ I want you to pack me back there where I can get med-dy-cinal attention er I 'm a dead man , fer I got my leg shot off , ” he says , “ and I want you to pack me back there so 's the surgeons kin take keer of me . ” Well — the feller , as luck would have it , ricko-nized him and run to him and throwed down his own musket , so 's he could pick him up ; and he stooped down and picked him up and kindo ’ half-way shouldered him and half-way helt him betwixt his arms like , and then he turned and started back with him — ha ! ha ! ha ! Now , mind , the fight was still a-goin ’ on — and right at the hot of the fight , and the feller , all excited , you know , like he was , and the soldier that had his leg shot off gittin ’ kindo fainty like , and his head kindo ’ stuck back over the feller 's shoulder that was carryin ’ him . And he had n't got more'n a couple o ’ rods with him when another cannon-ball come along and tuk his head off , shore enough !— and the curioust thing about it was — ha ! ha !— that the feller was a-packin ’ him did n't know that he had been hit ag'in at all , and back he went — still carryin ’ the deceased back — ha ! ha ! ha !— to where the doctors could take keer of him — as he thought . Well , his cap'n happened to see him , and he thought it was a ruther cur'ous p'ceedin ' s — a soldier carryin ’ a dead body out o ’ the fight — do n't you see ? And so he hollers at him , and he says to the soldier , the cap'n did , he says , “ Hullo , there ; where you goin ’ with that thing ? ” the cap'n said to the soldier who was a-carryin ’ away the feller that had his leg shot off . Well , his head , too , by that time . So he says , “ Where you goin ’ with that thing ? ” the cap'n said to the soldier who was a-carryin ’ away the feller that had his leg shot off . Well , the soldier he stopped — kinder halted , you know , like a private soldier will when his presidin ’ officer speaks to him — and he says to him , “ W'y , ” he says , “ Cap , it 's a comrade o ’ mine and the pore feller has got his leg shot off , and I 'm a-packin ’ him back to where the doctors is ; and there was nobody to he'p him , and the feller would ‘ a ’ died in his tracks — er track ruther — if it had n't a-been fer me , and I 'm a-packin ’ him back where the surgeons can take keer of him ; where he can get medical attendance — er his wife 's a widder ! ” he says , “ ‘ cause he 's got his leg shot off ! ” Then Cap'n says , “ You blame fool you , he 's got his head shot off . ” So then the feller slacked his grip on the body and let it slide down to the ground , and looked at it a minute , all puzzled , you know , and says , “ W'y , he told me it was his leg ! ” Ha ! ha ! ha !</docImprint>

     <l n="1">Mon cher Monsieur le Secretaire ,</l>
     <l n="2">Your song flits with me everywhere ;</l>
     <l n="3">It lights on Fancy 's prow and sings</l>
     <l n="4">Me on divinest voyagings :</l>
     <l n="5">And when my ruler love would fain</l>
     <l n="6">Be laid upon it — high again</l>
     <l n="7">It mounts , and hugs itself from me</l>
     <l n="8">With rapturous wings — still dwindlingly —</l>

     <l n="11">Little baby , you have wandered far away ,</l>
     <l n="12">And your fairy face comes back to me to-day ,</l>
     <l n="13">But I can not feel the strands</l>
     <l n="14">Of your tresses , nor the play</l>
     <l n="15">Of the dainty velvet-touches of your hands .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="16">Little baby , you were mine to hug and hold ;</l>

     <l n="19">And my richer wealth than gold ,</l>
     <l n="20">And the surest hope of Heaven that I knew !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="21">O for the lisp long silent , and the tone</l>
     <l n="22">Of merriment once mingled with my own —</l>
     <l n="23">For the laughter of your lips ,</l>
     <l n="24">And the kisses plucked and thrown</l>
     <l n="25">In the lavish wastings of your finger-tips !</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="26">Little baby , O as then , come back to me ,</l>

   <p>There has always been an inclination , or desire , rather , on my part to believe in the mystic — even as far back as stretches the gum-elastic remembrance of my first “ taffy-pullin ’ ” given in honor of my fifth birthday ; and the ghost-stories , served by way of ghastly dessert , by our hired girl . In fancy I again live over all the scenes of that eventful night :—</p>
   <p>The dingy kitchen , with its haunting odors of a thousand feasts and wash-days ; the old bench-legged stove , with its happy family of skillets , stewpans and round-bellied kettles crooning and blubbering about it . And how we children clustered round the genial hearth , with the warm smiles dying from our faces just as the embers dimmed and died out in the open grate , as with bated breath we listened to how some one 's grandmother had said that her first man went through a graveyard once , one stormy night , “ jest to show the neighbors that he was n't afeard o ’ nothin ’ , ” and how when he was just passing the grave of his first wife “ something kind o ’ big and white-like , with great big eyes like fire , raised up from behind the headboard , and kind o ’ re'ched out for him ” ; and how he turned and fled , “ with that air white thing after him as tight as it could jump , and a hollerin ’ ‘ wough-yough-yough ! ’ till you could hear it furder'n you could a bullgine , ” and how , at last , just as the brave and daring intruder was clearing two graves and the fence at one despairing leap , the “ white thing , ” had made a grab at him with its iron claws , and had nicked him so close his second wife was occasioned the onerous duty of affixing another patch in his pantaloons . And in conclusion , our hired girl went on to state that this blood-curdling incident had so wrought upon the feelings of “ the man that was n't afeard o ’ nothin ’ , ” and had given him such a distaste for that particular graveyard , that he never visited it again , and even entered a clause in his will to the effect that he would ever remain an unhappy corpse should his remains be interred in said graveyard .</p>
   <p>I forgot my pop-corn that night ; I forgot my taffy ; I forgot all earthly things ; and I tossed about so feverishly in my little bed , and withal so restlessly , that more than once my father 's admonition above the footboard of the big bed , of “ Drat you ! go to sleep , there ! ” foreshadowed my impending doom . And once he leaned over and made a vicious snatch at me , and holding me out at arm 's length by one leg , demanded in thunder-tones , “ what in the name o ’ flames and flashes I meant , anyhow ! ”</p>
   <p>I was afraid to stir a muscle from that on , in consequence of which I at length straggled off in fitful dreams — and heavens ! what dreams !— A very long and lank , and slim and slender old woman in white knocked at the door of my vision , and I let her in . She patted me on the head — and oh ! how cold her hands were ! And they were very hard hands , too , and very heavy — and , horror of horrors !— they were not hands — they were claws !— they were iron !— they were like the things I had seen the hardware man yank nails out of a keg with . I quailed and shivered till the long and slim and slender old woman jerked my head up and snarled spitefully , “ What 's the matter with you , bub , ” and I said , “ Nawthin ’ ! ” and she said , “ Do n't you dare to lie to me ! ” I moaned .</p>
   <p>“ Do n't you like me ? ” she asked .</p>
   <p>I hesitated .</p>
   <p>“ And lie if you dare ! ” she said — “ Do n't you like me ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Oomh-oomh ! ” said I .</p>
   <p>“ Why ? ” said she .</p>
   <p>“ Cos , you 're too long — and slim — an ’ ” —</p>
   <p>“ Go on ! ” said she .</p>
   <p>“ — And tall ! ” said I .</p>
   <p>“ Ah , ha ! ” said she ,— “ and that 's it , hey ? ”</p>
   <p>And then she began to grow shorter and thicker , and fatter and squattier .</p>
   <p>“ And how do I suit you now ? ” she wheezed at length , when she had wilted down to about the size of a large loaf of bread .</p>
   <p>I shook more violently than ever at the fearful spectacle .</p>
   <p>“ How do you like me now ? ” she yelped again ,— “ And do n't you lie to me neither , or I 'll swaller you whole ! ”</p>
   <p>I writhed and hid my face .</p>
   <p>“ Do you like me ? ”</p>
   <p>“ No-o-oh ! ” I moaned .</p>
   <p>She made another snatch at my hair . I felt her jagged claws sink into my very brain . I struggled and she laughed hideously .</p>
   <p>“ You do n't , hey ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Yes , yes , I do . I love you ! ” said I .</p>
   <p>“ You lie ! You lie ! ” She shrieked derisively . “ You know you lie ! ” and as I felt the iron talons sinking and gritting in my very brain , with one wild , despairing effort , I awoke .</p>
   <p>I saw the fire gleaming in the grate , and by the light it made I dimly saw the outline of the old mantelpiece that straddled it , holding the old clock high upon its shoulders . I was awake then , and the little squatty woman with her iron talons was a dream ! I felt an oily gladness stealing over me , and yet I shuddered to be all alone .</p>
   <p>If only some one were awake , I thought , whose blessed company would drown all recollections of that fearful dream ; but I dared not stir or make a noise . I could only hear the ticking of the clock , and my father 's sullen snore . I tried to compose my thoughts to pleasant themes , but that telescopic old woman in white would rise up and mock my vain appeals , until in fancy I again saw her altitudinous proportions dwindling into that repulsive and revengeful figure with the iron claws , and I grew restless and attempted to sit up . Heavens ! something yet held me by the hair . The chill sweat that betokens speedy dissolution gathered on my brow . I made another effort and arose , that deadly clutch yet fastened in my hair . Could it be possible ! The short , white woman still held me in her vengeful grasp ! I could see her white dress showing from behind either of my ears . She still clung to me , and with one wild , unearthly cry of “ Pap ! ” I started round the room .</p>
   <p>I remember nothing further , until as the glowing morn sifted through the maple at the window , powdering with gold the drear old room , and baptizing with its radiance the anxious group of old home-faces leaning over my bed , I heard my father 's voice once more rasping on my senses — “ Now get the booby up , and wash that infernal wax out of his hair ! ”</p>

     <p>THE GUIDE</p>
    </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>IMITATED</head>
     <l n="1">We rode across the level plain —</l>
     <l n="2">We — my sagacious guide and I .—</l>
     <l n="3">He knew the earth — the air — the sky ;</l>
     <l n="4">He knew when it would blow or rain ,</l>
     <l n="5">And when the weather would be dry :</l>
     <l n="6">The blended blades of grass spake out</l>
     <l n="7">To him when Redskins were about ;</l>
     <l n="8">The wagon tracks would tell him too ,</l>
     <l n="9">The very day that they rolled through :</l>
     <l n="10">He knew their burden — whence they came —</l>
     <l n="11">If any horse along were lame ,</l>
     <l n="12">And what its owner ought to do ;</l>
     <l n="13">He knew when it would snow ; he knew ,</l>
     <l n="14">By some strange intuition , when</l>
     <l n="15">The buffalo would overflow</l>
     <l n="16">The prairies like a flood , and then</l>
     <l n="17">Recede in their stampede again .</l>
     <l n="18">He knew all things — yea , he did know</l>
     <l n="19">The brand of liquor in my flask ,</l>
     <l n="20">And many times did tilt it up ,</l>
     <l n="21">Nor halt or hesitate one whit ,</l>
     <l n="22">Nor pause to slip the silver cup</l>
     <l n="23">From off its crystal base , nor ask</l>
     <l n="24">Why I preferred to drink from it .</l>
     <l n="25">And more and more I plied him , and</l>
     <l n="26">Did query of him o'er and o'er ,</l>
     <l n="27">And seek to lure from him the lore</l>
     <l n="28">By which the man did understand</l>
     <l n="29">These hidden things of sky and land :</l>
     <l n="30">And , wrought upon , he sudden drew</l>
     <l n="31">His bridle — wheeled , and caught my hand —</l>
     <l n="32">Pressed it , as one that loved me true ,</l>
     <l n="33">And bade me listen .</l>
     <l n="34">................... There be few</l>
     <l n="35">Like tales as strange to listen to !</l>
     <l n="36">He told me all — How , when a child ,</l>
     <l n="37">The Indians stole him — there he laughed —</l>
     <l n="38">“ They stole me , and I stole their craft ! ”</l>
     <l n="39">Then slowly winked both eyes , and smiled ,</l>
     <l n="40">And went on ramblingly ,— “ And they —</l>
     <l n="41">They reared me , and I ran away —</l>
     <l n="42">‘ Twas winter , and the weather wild ;</l>
     <l n="43">And , caught up in the awful snows</l>
     <l n="44">That bury wilderness and plain ,</l>

     <l n="46">My feet ere human hands again</l>
     <l n="47">Were reached to me in my distress ,—</l>
     <l n="48">And lo , since then not any rain</l>
     <l n="49">May fall upon me anywhere ,</l>
     <l n="50">Nor any cyclone 's cussedness</l>
     <l n="51">Slip up behind me unaware ,—</l>
     <l n="52">Nor any change of cold , or heat ,</l>
     <l n="53">Or blow , or snow , but I do know</l>
     <l n="54">It 's coming , days and days before ;—</l>
     <l n="55">I know it by my frozen feet —</l>
     <l n="56">I know it by my itching heels ,</l>
     <l n="57">And by the agony one feels</l>
     <l n="58">Who knows that scratching nevermore</l>
     <l n="59">Will bring to him the old and sweet</l>
     <l n="60">Relief he knew ere thus endowed</l>
     <l n="61">With knowledge that a certain cloud</l>
     <l n="62">Will burst with storm on such a day ,</l>
     <l n="63">And when a snow will fall , and — nay ,</l>
     <l n="64">I speak not falsely when I say</l>
     <l n="65">That by my tingling heels and toes</l>
     <l n="66">I measure time , and can disclose</l>
     <l n="67">The date of month — the week — and lo ,</l>
     <l n="68">The very day and minute — yea —</l>
     <l n="69">Look at your watch !— An hour ago</l>
     <l n="70">And twenty minutes I did say</l>
     <l n="71">Unto myself with bitter laugh ,</l>
     <l n="72">‘ In less than one hour and a half</l>
     <l n="73">Will I be drunken ! ’ Is it so ? ”</l>

     <p>A CALLER FROM BOONE</p>
    </lg>
   <p>BENJ . F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR</p>
   <p>It was a dim and chill and loveless afternoon in the late fall of eighty-three when I first saw the genial subject of this hasty sketch . From time to time the daily paper on which I worked had been receiving , among the general literary driftage of amateur essayists , poets and sketch-writers , some conceits in verse that struck the editorial head as decidedly novel ; and , as they were evidently the production of an unlettered man , and an old man , and a farmer at that , they were usually spared the waste-basket , and preserved — not for publication , but to pass from hand to hand among the members of the staff as simply quaint and mirth-provoking specimens of the verdancy of both the venerable author and the Muse inspiring him . Letters as quaint as were the poems invariably accompanied them , and the oddity of these , in fact , had first called attention to the verses . I well remember the general merriment of the office when the first of the old man 's letters was read aloud , and I recall , too , some of his comments on his own verse , verbatim . In one place he said : “ I make no doubt you will find some purty sad spots in my poetry , considerin ’ ; but I hope you will bear in mind that I am a great sufferer with rheumatizum , and have been , off and on , sence the cold New Year 's . In the main , however , ” he continued , “ I allus aim to write in a cheerful , comfortin ’ sperit , so 's ef the stuff hangs fire , and do n't do no good , it hai n't a-goin ’ to do no harm ,— and them 's my honest views on poetry . ”</p>
   <p>In another letter , evidently suspecting his poem had not appeared in print because of its dejected tone , he said : “ The poetry I herewith send was wrote off on the finest Autumn day I ever laid eyes on ! I never felt better in my life . The morning air was as invigoratin ’ as bitters with tanzy in it , and the folks at breakfast said they never saw such a ’ appetite on mortal man before . Then I lit out for the barn , and after feedin ’ , I come back and tuck my pen and ink out on the porch , and jest cut loose . I writ and writ till my fingers was that cramped I could n't hardly let go of the penholder . And the poem I send you is the upshot of it all . Ef you do n't find it cheerful enough fer your columns , I 'll have to knock under , that 's all ! ” And that poem , as I recall it , certainly was cheerful enough for publication , only the “ copy ” was almost undecipherable , and the ink , too , so pale and vague , it was thought best to reserve the verses , for the time , at least , and later on revise , copy , punctuate , and then print it sometime , as much for the joke of it as anything . But it was still delayed , neglected , and in a week 's time almost entirely forgotten . And so it was , upon this chill and sombre afternoon I speak of that an event occurred which most pleasantly reminded me of both the poem with the “ sad spots ” in it , and the “ cheerful ” one , “ writ out on the porch ” that glorious autumn day that poured its glory through the old man 's letter to us .</p>
   <p>Outside and in the sanctum the gloom was too oppressive to permit an elevated tendency of either thought or spirit . I could do nothing but sit listless and inert . Paper and pencil were before me , but I could not write — I could not even think coherently , and was on the point of rising and rushing out into the streets for a wild walk , when there came a hesitating knock at the door .</p>
   <p>“ Come in ! ” I snarled , grabbing up my pencil and assuming a frightfully industrious air : “ Come in ! ” I almost savagely repeated , “ Come in ! And shut the door behind you ! ” and I dropped my lids , bent my gaze fixedly upon the blank pages before me and began scrawling some disconnected nothings with no head or tail or anything .</p>
   <p>“ Sir ; howdy , ” said a low and pleasant voice . And at once , in spite of my perverse resolve , I looked up . I someway felt rebuked .</p>
   <p>The speaker was very slowly , noiselessly closing the door . I could hardly face him when he turned around . An old man , of sixty-five , at least , but with a face and an eye of the most cheery and wholesome expression I had ever seen in either youth or age . Over his broad bronzed forehead and white hair he wore a low-crowned , wide-brimmed black felt hat , somewhat rusted now , and with the band grease-crusted , and the binding frayed at intervals , and sagging from the threads that held it on . An old-styled frock coat of black , dull brown in streaks , and quite shiny about the collar and lapels . A waistcoat of no describable material or pattern , and a clean white shirt and collar of one piece , with a black string-tie and double bow , which would have been entirely concealed beneath the long white beard but for its having worked around to one side of the neck . The front outline of the face was cleanly shaven , and the beard , growing simply from the under chin and throat , lent the old pioneer the rather singular appearance of having hair all over him with this luxurious growth pulled out above his collar for mere sample .</p>
   <p>I arose and asked the old man to sit down , handing him a chair decorously .</p>
   <p>“ No — no , ” he said — “ I 'm much obleeged . I hai n't come in to bother you no more'n I can he'p . All I wanted was to know ef you got my poetry all right . You know I take yer paper , ” he went on , in an explanatory way , “ and seein ’ you printed poetry in it once-in-a-while , I sent you some of mine — neighbors kindo ’ advised me to , ” he added apologetically , “ and so I sent you some — two or three times I sent you some , but I hai n't never seed hide-ner-hair of it in your paper , and as I wus in town to-day , anyhow , I jest thought I 'd kindo ’ drap in and git it back , ef you ai n't goin ’ to print it — ‘ cause I allus save up most the things I write , aimin ’ sometime to git ‘ em all struck off in pamphlet-form , to kindo ’ distribit round ‘ mongst the neighbors , do n't you know . ”</p>
   <p>Already I had begun to suspect my visitor 's identity , and was mechanically opening the drawer of our poetical department .</p>
   <p>“ How was your poetry signed ? ” I asked .</p>
   <p>“ Signed by my own name , ” he answered proudly ,— “ signed by my own name ,— Johnson — Benjamin F. Johnson , of Boone County — this state . ”</p>
   <p>“ And is this one of them , Mr. Johnson ? ” I asked , unfolding a clumsily-folded manuscript , and closely scrutinizing the verse .</p>
   <p>“ How does she read ? ” said the old man eagerly , and searching in the meantime for his spectacles . “ How does she read ?— Then I can tell you ! ”</p>
   <p>“ It reads , ” said I , studiously conning the old man 's bold but bad chirography , and tilting my chair back indolently ,— “ it reads like this — the first verse does , ” — and I very gravely read :—</p>
   <p>“ Oh ! the old swimmin ’ - hole ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Stop ! Stop ! ” said the old man excitedly — “ Stop right there ! That 's my poetry , but that 's not the way to read it by a long shot ! Give it to me ! ” and he almost snatched it from my hand . “ Poetry like this ai n't no poetry at all , ‘ less you read it natchurl and in jes the same sperit ‘ at it 's writ in , do n't you understand . It 's a ’ old man a-talkin ’ , rickollect , and a-feelin ’ kindo ’ sad , and yit kindo ’ sorto ’ good , too , and I opine he would n't got that off with a face on him like a ’ undertaker , and a voice as solemn as a cow-bell after dark ! He 'd say it more like this . ” — And the old man adjusted his spectacles and read :—</p>

   <p>THE JUDKINS PAPERS</p>
   <p>FATHER AND SON</p>
   <p>Mr. Judkins ’ boy came home yesterday with a bottle of bugs in his pocket , and as the quiet little fellow sat on the back porch in his favorite position , his legs elbowed and flattened out beneath him like a letter “ W , ” his genial and eccentric father came suddenly upon him .</p>
   <p>“ And what 's the blame ’ boy up to now ? ” said Mr. Judkins , in an assumed tone of querulous displeasure , as he bent over the boy from behind and gently tweaked his ear .</p>
   <p>“ Oh , here , mister ! ” said the boy , without looking up ; “ you thist let up on that , will you ! ”</p>
   <p>“ What you got there , I tell you ! ” continued the smiling Mr. Judkins , in a still gruffer tone , relinquishing the boy 's ear , and gazing down upon the fluffy towhead with more than ordinary admiration . “ What you got there ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Bugs , ” said the boy — “ you know ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Dead , are they ? ” said Mr. Judkins .</p>
   <p>“ Some of ‘ em 's dead , ” said the boy , carefully running a needle through the back of a large bumblebee . “ All these uns is , you kin bet ! You do n't think a feller ‘ ud try to string a live bumblebee , I reckon ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Well , no , ‘ Squire , ” said Mr. Judkins , airily , addressing the boy by one of the dozen nicknames he had given him ; “ not a live bumblebee — a real stem-winder , of course not . But what in the name o ’ limpin ’ Lazarus air you stringin ’ ‘ em fer ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Got a live snake-feeder , ” said the boy , ignoring the parental inquiry . “ See him down there in the bottom , ‘ ith all th ’ other uns on top of him . Thist watch him now , an ’ you kin see him pant . I kin . Yes , an ’ I got a beetle ‘ at 's purt ’ nigh alive , too — on'y he can n't pull in his other wings . See ‘ em ? ” continued the boy , with growing enthusiasm , twirling the big-mouthed bottle like a kaleidoscope . “ Hate beetles ! ‘ cause they allus act so big , an ’ make s'much fuss about theirselves , an ’ do n't know nothin ’ neither ! Bet ef I had as many wings as a beetle I would n't let no boy my size knock the stuffin ’ out o ’ me with no bunch o ’ weeds , like I done him ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Howd'ye know you would n't ? ” said Mr. Judkins , austerely , biting his nails and winking archly to himself .</p>
   <p>“ W'y , I know I would n't , ” said the boy , “ ‘ cause I 'd keep up in the air where I could fly , an ’ would n't come low down ut all — bumpin ’ around ‘ mongst them bushes , an ’ buzzin ’ against things , an ’ buttin ’ my brains out a-tryin ’ to git thue fence cracks . ”</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Spect you 'd ruther be a snake-feeder , would n't you , Bud ? ” said Mr. Judkins suggestively . “ Snake-feeders has got about enough wings to suit you , ef you want more'n one pair , and ever ’ day 's a picnic with a snake-feeder , you know . Nothin ’ to do but jes ’ loaf up and down the crick , and roost on reeds and cat-tails , er fool around a feller 's fish-line and light on the cork and bob up and down with it till she goes clean under , do n't you know ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Do n't want to be no snake-feeder , neither , ” said the boy , “ ‘ cause they gits gobbled up , first thing they know , by these ‘ ere big green bullfrogs ut they can n't ever tell from the skum till they 've lit right in their mouth — and then they 're goners ! No , sir ; ” continued the boy , drawing an extra quinine-bottle from another pocket , and holding it up admiringly before his father 's eyes : “ There 's the feller in there ut I 'd ruther be than have a pony ! ”</p>
   <p>“ W'y , it 's a nasty p'izen spider ! ” exclaimed Mr. Judkins , pushing back the bottle with affected abhorrence , “ and he 's alive , too ! ”</p>
   <p>“ You bet he 's alive ! ” said the boy , “ an ’ you kin bet he 'll never come to no harm while I own him ! ” and as the little fellow spoke his face glowed with positive affection , and the twinkle of his eyes , as he continued , seemed wonderfully like his father 's own . “ Tell you , I like spiders ! Spiders is awful fat — all but their head — and that 's level , you kin bet ! Flies hai n't got no business with a spider . Ef a spider ever reaches fer a fly , he 's his meat ! The spider , he likes to loaf an ’ lay around in the shade an ’ wait fer flies an ’ bugs an ’ things to come a-foolin ’ round his place . He lays back in the hole in the corner of his web , an ’ waits till somepin ’ lights on it an ’ nen when he hears ‘ em buzzin ’ , he thist crawls out an ’ fixes ‘ em so 's they can n't buzz , an ’ he 's got the truck to do it with ! I bet ef you 'd unwind all the web-stuff out of thist one little spider not bigger'n a pill , it ‘ ud be long enough fer a kite-string ! Onc't they wuz one in our wood-house , an ’ a taterbug got stuck in his web , an ’ the spider worked purt ’ nigh two days ‘ fore he got him so 's he could n't move . Nen he could n't eat him neither — ‘ cause they 's shells on ‘ em , you know , an ’ the spider did n't know how to hull him . Ever ’ time I 'd go there the spider , he 'd be a-wrappin ’ more stuff around th ’ ole bug , an ’ stoopin ’ down like he wuz a-whisperin ’ to him . An ’ one day I went in ag'in , an ’ he was a-hangin ’ , alas an ’ cold in death ! An ’ I poked him with a splinter an ’ his web broke off — ‘ spect he 'd used it all up on the wicked bug — an ’ it killed him ; an ’ I buried him in a ’ ink-bottle an ’ mashed the old bug ‘ ith a chip ! ”</p>
   <p>“ Yes , ” said Judkins , in a horrified tone , turning away to conceal the real zest and enjoyment his face must have betrayed ; “ yes , and some day you 'll come home p'izened , er somepin ’ ! And I want to say right here , my young man , ef ever you do , and it do n't kill you , I 'll lint you within an inch of your life ! ” And as the eccentric Mr. Judkins whirled around the corner of the porch he heard the boy murmur in his low , absent-minded way , “ Yes , you will ! ”</p>
   <p>MR. JUDKINS ’ REMARKS</p>
   <p>Judkins stopped us in front of the post-office yesterday to say that that boy of his was “ the blamedest boy outside o ’ the annals o ’ history ! ” “ Talk about this boy-naturalist out here at Indianapolis , ” says Judkins ,— “ w'y , he ai n't nowhere to my boy ! The little cuss do n't do nothin ’ either only set around and look sleepy , and dern him , he gits off more dry things than you could print in your paper . Of late he 's been a-displayin ’ a sort o ’ weakness fer Nature , do n't you know ; and he 's allus got a bottle o ’ bugs in his pocket . He come home yesterday evening with a blame ’ mud-turtle as big as an unabridged dictionary , and turned him over in the back yard and commenced biffin ’ away at him with a hammer and a cold-chisel . ‘ W'y , you 're a-killin ’ the turtle , ’ says I . ‘ Kill nothin ’ ! ' says he , ‘ I 'm thist a-takin ’ the lid off so 's I can see his clock works . ’ Hoomh ! ” says Judkins : “ He 's a good one !— only , ” he added , “ I would n't have the boy think so fer the world ! ”</p>
   <p>JUDKINS ’ BOY ON THE MUD-TURTLE</p>
   <p>The mud-turtle is not a beast of pray , but he dearly loves catfish bait . If a mud-turtle gits your big toe in his mouth he will hang on till it thunders . Then he will spit it out like he was disgusted . The mud-turtle kin swim and keep his chin out of water ef he wants to but he do n't care ef he does sink . The turtle kin stay under water until his next birthday , an ’ never crack a smile . He kin breathe like a grown person , but he do n't haf to , on'y when he is on dry land , an ’ then I guess he thist does it to be soshibul . Allus when you see bubbles a-comin ’ up in the swimmin ’ hole , you kin bet your galluses they 's a mud-turtle a-layin ’ down there , studyin ’ up some cheap way to git his dinner . Mud-turtles never dies , on'y when they make soup out of ‘ em . They is seven kinds of meat in the turtle , but I 'd ruther eat thist plain burnt liver .</p>
   <p>ON FROGS</p>
   <p>Frogs is the people 's friend , but they can n't fly . Onc't they wuz tadpoles about as big as lickerish drops , an ’ after while legs growed on ‘ em . Oh , let us love the frog — he looks so sorry . Frogs kin swim better'n little boys , and they do n't haf to hold their nose when they dive , neither . Onc't I had a pet frog ; an ’ the cars run over him . It thist squshed him . Bet he never knowed what hurt him ! Onc't they wuz a rich lady swallered one — when he wuz little , you know ; an ’ he growed up in her , an ’ it did n't kill him ut all . An ’ you could hear him holler in her bosom . It was a tree-toad ; and so ever ’ time he 'd go p-r-r-r-r - w'y , nen the grand lady she 'd know it was goin ’ to rain , an ’ make her little boy run an ’ putt the tub under the spout . Was n't that a b'utiful frog ?</p>
   <p>ON PIRUTS</p>
   <p>Piruts is reckless to a fault . They ai n't afeard of nobody ner nothin ’ . Ef ever you insult a pirut onc't , he 'll foller you to the grave but what he will revenge his wrongs . Piruts all looks like pictures of “ Buffalo Bill ” — on'y they do n't shave off the whiskers that sticks out over the collar of their low-necked shirt . Ever ’ day is a picknick fer the piruts of the high seas . They eat gunpowder an ’ drink blood to make ‘ em savage , and then they kill people all day , an ’ set up all night an ’ tell ghost stories an ’ sing songs such as mortal ear would quail to listen to . Piruts never comes on shore on'y when they run out of tobacker ; an ’ then it 's a cold day ef they do n't land at midnight , an ’ disguize theirselves an ’ slip up in town like a sleuth houn ’ , so 's the Grand Jury can n't git on to ‘ em . They do n't care fer the police any more than us people who dwells right in their midst . Piruts makes big wages an ’ spends it like a king . “ Come easy , go easy , ” is the fatal watchword of them whose deeds is Deth . Onc't they wuz a pirut turned out of the house an ’ home by his cruel parents when he wuz but a kid , an ’ so he always went by that name . He was thrust adrift without a nickel , an ’ sailed fer distant shores to hide his shame fer those he loved . In the dead of night he stol 'd a new suit of the captain 's clothes . An ’ when he growed up big enough to fit ‘ em , he gaily dressed hissef and went up an ’ paced the quarter-deck in deep thought . He had not fergot how the captain onc't had lashed him to the jib-boom-poop an ’ whipped him . That stung his proud spirit even then ; an ’ so the first thing he done was to slip up behind the cruel officer an ’ push him over-board . Then the ship wuz his fer better er fer worse . An ’ so he took command , an ’ hung high upon the beetling mast the pirut flag . Then he took the Bible his old mother give him , an ’ tied a darnic round it an ’ sunk it in the sand with a mocking laugh . Then it wuz that he wuz ready fer the pirut 's wild seafaring life . He worked the business fer all they wuz in it fer many years , but wuz run in ut last . An ’ , standin ’ on the gallus-tree , he sung a song which wuz all wrote off by hissef . An ’ then they knocked the trap on him . An ’ thus the brave man died and never made a kick . In life he wuz allus careful with his means , an ’ saved up vast welth , which he dug holes and buried , an ’ died with the secret locked in his bosom to this day .</p>
   <p>ON HACKMENS</p>
   <p>Hackmens has the softest thing in the bizness . They hai n't got nothin ’ to do but look hump-shouldered an ’ chaw tobacker an ’ wait . Hackmens all looks like detectives , an ’ keeps still , an ’ never even spits when you walk past ‘ em . An ’ they 're allus cold . A hackman that stands high in the p'fession kin wear a overcoat in dog-days an ’ then look chilly an ’ like his folks wuz all dead but the old man , an ’ he wuz a drunkard . Ef a hackman would on'y be a blind fiddler he 'd take in more money than a fair-ground . Hackmens never gives nothin ’ away . You kin trust a hackman when you can n't trust your own mother . Some people thinks when they hire a hack to take ‘ em some place that the hackman has got some grudge ag'in ’ ‘ em — but he hai n't — he 's allus that way . He loves you but he knows his place , and smothers his real feelings . In life 's giddy scenes hackmens all wears a mask ; but down deep in their heart you kin bet they are yourn till deth . Some hackmens look like they wuz stuck up , but they hai n't — it 's only ‘ cause they got on so much clothes . Onc't a hackman wuz stabbed by a friend of his in the same bizness , an ’ when the doctors wuz seein ’ how bad he wuz karved up , they found he had on five shurts . They said that wuz all that saved his life . They said ef he 'd on'y had on four shurts , he 'd ‘ a ’ been a ded man . An ’ the hackman hissef , when he got well , used to brag it wuz the closetest call he ever had , an ’ laid fer the other hackman , an ’ hit him with a car couplin ’ an ’ killed him , an ’ come mighty nigh goin ’ to the penitenchary fer it . Influenshal friends wuz all that saved him that time . No five shurts would ‘ a ’ done it . The mayor said that when he let him off , an ’ brought down the house , an ’ made hissef a strong man fer another term . Some mayors is purty slick , but a humble hackman may sometimes turn out to be thist as smooth . The on'y thing w'y a hackman do n't show up no better is ‘ cause he loses so much sleep . That 's why he allus looks like he had the headache , an ’ did n't care ef he did . Onc't a hackman wuz waitin ’ in front of a hotel one morning an ’ wuz sort o ’ dozin ’ like , an ’ fell off his seat . An ’ they run an ’ picked him up , an ’ he wuz unconshus , an ’ they worked with him till ‘ way long in the afternoon ‘ fore they found out he wuz thist asleep ; an ’ he cussed fearful cause they waked him up , an ’ wondered why people could n't never tend to their own bizness like he did .</p>
   <p>ON DUDES</p>
   <p>Ever'body is allus a-givin ’ it to Dudes . Newspapers makes fun of ‘ em , an ’ artists makes pictures of ‘ em ; an ’ the on'y ones in the wide world that stuck on Dudes is me an ’ the Dudes theirse'f , an ’ we love an ’ cherish ‘ em with all a parent 's fond regards . An ’ nobody knows much about Dudes neither , ‘ cause they hai n't been broke out long enough yit to tell thist what the disease is . Some say it 's softinning of the brains , an ’ others claim it can n't be that , on the groun 's they hai n't got material fer the softinning to work on , &amp; c ., &amp; c ., till even “ Sientests is puzzled , ” as the good book says . An ’ ef I wuz a-goin ’ to say what ails Dudes I 'd have to give it up , er pernounce it a ’ aggervated case of Tyfoid blues , which is my ‘ onnest convictions . That 's what makes me kind o ’ stand in with ‘ em — same as ef they wuz the under-dog . I am willing to aknolege that Dudes has their weakness , but so has ever'thing . Even Oscar Wild , ef putt to the test ; an ’ I allus feel sorry fer George Washington ‘ cause he died ‘ fore he got to see Oscar Wild . An ’ then another reason w'y you oughte n't to jump on to Dudes is , they do n't know what 's the matter with ‘ em any more than us folks in whom they come in daily contack . Dudes all walks an ’ looks in the face like they wuz on their way to fill an engagement with a revolvin ’ lady wax-figger in some milliner-winder , an ’ had fergot the number of her place of bizness . Some folks is mean enough to bitterly a'sert that Dudes is strained in their manner an ’ fools from choice ; but they ai n't . It 's a gift — Dudes is Geenuses — that 's what Dudes is !</p>
   <p>ON RED HAIR</p>
   <p>Onc't a pore boy wuz red-hedded , an ’ got mad at the other boys when they 'd throw it up to him . An ’ when they 'd laugh at his red hed , an ’ ast him fer a light , er wuz n't he afeard he 'd singe his cap , an ’ orto ’ wear a tin hat , er pertend to warm their hands by him ,— w'y , sometimes the red-hedded boy 'd git purty hot indeed ; an ’ onc't he told another boy that wuz a-bafflin ’ him about his red hair that ef he wuz him he 'd git a fine comb an ’ go to canvassin ’ his own hed , and then he 'd be liabul to sceer up a more livelier subjeck to talk about than red hair . An ’ then the other boy says , “ You 're a liar ” an ’ that got the red-hedded boy into more trouble ; fer the old man whipped him shameful ’ fer breakin ’ up soil with the other boy . An ’ this here red-hedded boy had freckles , too . An ’ warts . An ’ nobody ort n't to ‘ a ’ jumpt on to him fer that . Ef anybody wuz a red-hedded boy they 'd have also warts an ’ freckles — an ’ thist red-hair 's bad enough . Onc't another boy told him ef he wuz him he bet he could make a big day look sick some night . An ’ when the red-hedded boy says “ How ? ” w'y , the other boy he says “ Easy enough . I 'd thist march around bare-hedded in the torch-light p'cession . ” — “ Yes , you would , ” says the red-hedded boy , an ’ pasted him one with a shinny club , an ’ got dispelled from school ‘ cause he wuz so high-tempered an ’ impulsiv . Ef I wuz the red-hedded boy I 'd be a pirut ; but he allus said he wuz goin ’ to be a baker .</p>
   <p>THE CROSS-EYED GIRL</p>
   <p>“ You do n't want to never tamper with a cross-eyed girl , ” said Mr. Judkins , “ and I 'll tell you w'y : They 've natur'lly got a better focus on things than a man would ever guess — studyin ’ their eyes , you understand . A man may think he 's a-foolin ’ a cross-eyed girl simply because she 's apparently got her eyes tangled on other topics as he 's a-talkin ’ to her , but at the same time that girl may be a-lookin ’ down the windin ’ stairway of the cellar of his soul with one eye , and a-winkin ’ in a whisper to her own soul with the other , and her unconscious victim jes ’ a-takin ’ it fer granted that nothin ’ is the matter with the girl , only jes ’ cross-eyes ! You see I 've studied ‘ em , ” continued Judkins , “ and I 'm on to one fact dead sure — and that is , their natures is as deceivin ’ as their eyes is ! Knowed one onc't that had her eyes mixed up thataway — sensitive little thing she was , and always referrin ’ to her ‘ misfortune , ’ as she called it , and eternally threatenin ’ to have some surgeon straighten ‘ em out like other folks ’ — and , sir , that girl so worked on my feelin 's , and took such underholts on my sympathies that , blame me , before I knowed it I confessed to her that ef it had n't ‘ a ’ been fer her defective eyes ( I made it ‘ defective ’ ) I never would have thought of lovin ’ her , and , furthermore ef ever she did have ‘ em changed back normal , do n't you understand , she might consider our engagement at an end — I did , honest . And that girl was so absolute cross-eyed it warped her ears , and she used to amuse herself by watchin ’ ‘ em curl up as I 'd be a-talkin ’ to her , and that maddened me , ‘ cause I 'm natur'lly of a jealous disposition , you know , and so , at last , I jes ’ casually hinted that ef she was really a-goin ’ to git them eyes carpentered up , w'y she 'd better git at it : and that ended it .</p>
   <p>“ And then the blame ’ girl turned right around and married a fellow that had a better pair of eyes than mine this minute ! Then I struck another cross-eyed girl — not really a legitimate case , ‘ cause , in reality , she only had one off eye — the right eye , ef I do n't disremember — the other one was as square as a gouge . And that girl was , ef any difference , a more confusin ’ case than the other , and besides all that , she had some money in her own right , and war n't a-throwin ’ off no big discount on one game eye . But I finally got her interested , and I reckon something serious might ‘ a ’ come of it — but , you see , her father was dead , and her stepmother sort o ’ shet down on my comin ’ to the house ; besides that , she had three grown uncles , and you know how uncles is . I did n't want to marry no family , of course , and so I slid out of the scheme , and tackled a poor girl that clerked in a post-office . Her eyes was bad ! I never did git the hang of them eyes of hern . She had purty hair , and a complexion , I used to tell her , which outrivalled the rose . But them eyes , you know ! I did n't really appreciate how bad they was crossed , at first . You see , it took time . Got her to give me her picture , and I used to cipher on that , but finally worked her off on a young friend of mine who wanted to marry intellect — give her a good send-off to him — and she was smart — only them eyes , you know ! Why , that girl could read a postal card , both sides at once , and smile at a personal friend through the office window at the same time ! ”</p>
   <p>HOMESICKNESS</p>
   <p>There was a more than ordinary earnestness in the tone of Mr. Judkins as he said : “ Referrin ’ to this thing of bein ’ homesick , I want to say right here that of all diseases , afflictions er complaints , this thing of bein ’ homesick takes the cookies ! A man may think when he 's got a ’ aggrivated case of janders , er white-swellin ’ , say , er bone-erysipelas , that he 's to be looked up to as bein ’ purty well fixed in this vale of trouble and unrest , but I want to tell you , when I want my sorrow blood-raw , do n't you understand , you may give me homesickness — straight goods , you know — and I 'll git more clean , legitimate agony out of that than you can out of either of the other attractions — yes , er even ef you 'd ring in the full combination on me ! You see , there 's no way of treatin ’ homesickness only one — and that is to git back home — but as that 's a remedy you can n't git at no drug store , at so much per box — and ef you could , fer instance , and only had enough ready money anyhow to cover half the cost of a full box — and nothin ’ but a full box ever reached the case — w'y , it follers that your condition still remains critical . And homesickness do n't show no favors . It 's jes ’ as liable to strike you as me . High er low , er rich er poor , all comes under her jurishdiction , and whenever she once reaches fer a citizen , you can jes ’ bet she gits there Eli , ever ’ time !</p>
   <p>“ She do n't confine herse'f to youth , ner make no specialty of little children either , but she stalks abroad like a census-taker , and is as conscientious . She visits the city girl clean up to Maxinkuckee , and makes her wonder how things really is back home without her . And then she haunts her dreams , and wakes her up at all hours of the night , and sings old songs over fer her , and talks to her in low thrillin ’ tones of a young man whose salary ai n't near big enough fer two ; and then she leaves her photograph with her and comes away , and makes it lively fer the boys on the train , the conductor , the brakeman and the engineer . She even nests out the travellin ’ man , and yanks him out of his reclinin ’ chair , and walks him up and down the car , and runs him clean out of cigars and finecut , and smiles to hear him swear . Then she gits off at little country stations and touches up the night operator , who grumbles at his boy companion , and wishes to dernation ‘ six ’ was in , so 's he could ‘ pound his ear . ’</p>
   <p>“ And I 'll never forgit , ” continued Mr. Judkins , “ the last case of homesickness I had , and the cure I took fer it . ‘ Tai n't been more'n a week ago neither . You see my old home is a'most too many laps from this base to make it very often , and in consequence I had n't been there fer five years and better , till this last trip , when I jes ’ succumbed to the pressure , and th'owed up my hands and went . Seemed like I 'd ‘ a ’ died if I had n't . And it was glorious to rack around the old town again — things lookin ’ jes ’ the same , mighty nigh , as they was when I was a boy , do n't you know . Run acrost an old schoolmate , too , and tuck supper at his happy little home , and then we got us a good nickel cigar , and walked and walked , and talked and talked ! Tuck me all around , you understand , in the meller twilight — till , the first thing you know , there stood the old schoolhouse where me and him first learnt to chew tobacco , and all that ! Well , sir ! you hai n't got no idea of the feelin 's that was mine ! W'y , I felt like I could th'ow my arms around the dear old buildin ’ and squeeze it till the cupolo would jes ’ pop out of the top of the roof like the core out of a b'ile ! And I think if they ever was a ’ epoch in my life when I could ‘ a ’ tackled poetry without no compunctions , as the feller says , w'y , then was the time — shore ! ”</p>

   <p>THE OBJECT LESSON</p>
   <p>Barely a year ago I attended the Friday afternoon exercises of a country school . My mission there , as I remember , was to refresh my mind with such material as might be gathered , for a “ valedictory , ” which , I regret to say , was to be handed down to posterity under another signature than my own .</p>
   <p>There was present , among a host of visitors , a pale young man of perhaps thirty years , with a tall head and bulging brow and a highly intellectual pair of eyes and spectacles . He wore his hair without roach or “ part ” and the smile he beamed about him was “ a joy forever . ” He was an educator — from the East , I think I heard it rumoured — anyway he was introduced to the school at last , and he bowed , and smiled , and beamed upon us all , and entertained us after the most delightfully edifying manner imaginable . And although I may fail to reproduce the exact substance of his remarks upon that highly important occasion , I think I can at least present his theme in all its coherency of detail . Addressing more particularly the primary department of the school , he said :—</p>
   <p>“ As the little exercise I am about to introduce is of recent origin , and the bright , intelligent faces of the pupils before me seem rife with eager and expectant interest , it will be well for me , perhaps , to offer by way of preparatory preface , a few terse words of explanation .</p>
   <p>“ The Object Lesson is designed to fill a long-felt want , and is destined , as I think , to revolutionize , in a great degree , the educational systems of our land .— In my belief , the Object Lesson will supply a want which I may safely say has heretofore left the most egregious and palpable traces of mental confusion and intellectual inadequacies stamped , as it were , upon the gleaming reasons of the most learned — the highest cultured , and the most eminently gifted and promising of our professors and scientists both at home and abroad .</p>
   <p>“ Now this deficiency — if it may be so termed — plainly has a beginning ; and probing deeply with the bright , clean scalpel of experience we discover that — ‘ As the twig is bent the tree 's inclined . ’ To remedy , then , a deeply seated error which for so long has rankled at the very root of educational progress throughout the land , many plausible , and we must admit , many helpful theories have been introduced to allay the painful errors resulting from the discrepancy of which we speak : but until now , nothing that seemed wholly to eradicate the defect has been discovered , and that , too , strange as it may seem , is , at last , emanating , like the mighty river , from the simplest source , but broadening and gathering in force and power as it flows along , until , at last , its grand and mighty current sweeps on in majesty to the vast illimitable ocean of — of — of — Success ! Ahem !</p>
   <p>“ And , now , little boys and girls , that we have had by implication , a clear and comprehensive explanation of the Object Lesson and its mission , I trust you will give me your undivided attention while I endeavor — in my humble way — to direct your newly acquired knowledge through the proper channel . For instance :—</p>
   <p>“ This little object I hold in my hand — who will designate it by its proper name ? Come , now , let us see who will be the first to answer . ‘ A peanut , ’ says the little boy here at my right . Very good — very good ! I hold , then , in my hand , a peanut . And now who will tell me , what is the peanut ? A very simple question — who will answer ? ‘ Something good to eat , ’ says the little girl . Yes , ‘ something good to eat , ’ but would it not be better to say simply that the peanut is an edible ? I think so , yes . The peanut , then , is — an edible — now , all together , an edible !</p>
   <p>“ To what kingdom does the peanut belong ? The animal , vegetable , or mineral kingdom ? A very easy question . Come , let us have prompt answers . ‘ The animal kingdom , ’ does the little boy say ? Oh , no ! The peanut does not belong to the animal kingdom ! Surely the little boy must be thinking of a larger object than the peanut — the elephant , perhaps . To what kingdom , then , does the peanut belong ? The v-v-veg — ‘ The vegetable kingdom , ’ says the bright-faced little girl on the back seat . Ah ! that is better . We find then that the peanut belongs to the — what kingdom ? The ‘ vegetable kingdom . ’ Very good , very good !</p>
   <p>“ And now who will tell us of what the peanut is composed . Let us have quick responses now . Time is fleeting ! Of what is the peanut composed ? ‘ The hull and the goody , ’ some one answers . Yes , ‘ the hull and the goody ’ in vulgar parlance , but how much better it would be to say simply , the shell and the kernel . Would not that sound better ? Yes , I thought you would agree with me there !</p>
   <p>“ And now who will tell me the color of the peanut ! And be careful now ! for I should n't like to hear you make the very stupid blunder I once heard a little boy make in reply to the same question . Would you like to hear what color the stupid little boy said the peanut was ? You would , eh ? Well , now , how many of you would like to hear what color the stupid little boy said the peanut was ? Come now , let 's have an expression . All who would like to hear what color the stupid little boy said the peanut was , may hold up their right hands . Very good , very good — there , that will do .</p>
   <p>“ Well , it was during a professional visit I was once called upon to make to a neighboring city , where I was invited to address the children of a free school — Hands down , now , little boy — founded for the exclusive benefit of the little newsboys and bootblacks , who , it seems , had not the means to defray the expenses of the commonest educational accessories , and during an object lessen — identical with the one before us now — for it is a favorite one of mine — I propounded the question , what is the color of the peanut ? Many answers were given in response , but none as sufficiently succinct and apropos as I deemed the facts demanded ; and so at last I personally addressed a ragged , but , as I then thought , a bright-eyed little fellow , when judge of my surprise , in reply to my question what is the color of the peanut , the little fellow , without the slightest gleam of intelligence lighting up his face , answered , that ‘ if not scorched in roasting , the peanut was a blond . ’ Why , I was almost tempted to join in the general merriment his inapposite reply elicited . But I occupy your attention with trivial things ; and as I notice the time allotted to me has slipped away , we will drop the peanut for the present . Trusting the few facts gleaned from a topic so homely and unpromising will sink deep in your minds , in time to bloom and blossom in the fields of future usefulness — I — I —— I thank you . ”</p>
