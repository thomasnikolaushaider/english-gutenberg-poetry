      <head>TOUSSAINT L'OUVERTURE .</head>
      <head>Toussaint L'Ouverture , the black chieftain of Hayti , was a slave on the plantation “ de Libertas , ” belonging to M. Bayou . When the rising of the negroes took place , in 1791 , Toussaint refused to join them until he had aided M. Bayou and his family to escape to Baltimore . The white man had discovered in Toussaint many noble qualities , and had instructed him in some of the first branches of education ; and the preservation of his life was owing to the negro 's gratitude for this kindness . In 1797 , Toussaint L'Ouverture was appointed , by the French government , General-in-Chief of the armies of St. Domingo , and , as such , signed the Convention with General Maitland for the evacuation of the island by the British . From this period , until 1801 , the island , under the government of Toussaint , was happy , tranquil , and prosperous . The miserable attempt of Napoleon to re-establish slavery in St. Domingo , although it failed of its intended object , proved fatal to the negro chieftain . Treacherously seized by Leclerc , he was hurried on board a vessel by night , and conveyed to France , where he was confined in a cold subterranean dungeon , at Besancon , where , in April , 1803 , he died . The treatment of Toussaint finds a parallel only in the murder of the Duke D'Enghien . It was the remark of Godwin , in his Lectures , that the West India Islands , since their first discovery by Columbus , could not boast of a single name which deserves comparison with that of Toussaint L'Ouverture .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">‘ T WAS night . The tranquil moonlight smile</l>
       <l n="2">With which Heaven dreams of Earth , shed down</l>
       <l n="3">Its beauty on the Indian isle ,—</l>
       <l n="4">On broad green field and white-walled town ;</l>
       <l n="5">And inland waste of rock and wood ,</l>
       <l n="6">In searching sunshine , wild and rude ,</l>
       <l n="7">Rose , mellowed through the silver gleam ,</l>
       <l n="8">Soft as the landscape of a dream .</l>
       <l n="9">All motionless and dewy wet ,</l>
       <l n="10">Tree , vine , and flower in shadow met</l>
       <l n="11">The myrtle with its snowy bloom ,</l>
       <l n="12">Crossing the nightshade 's solemn gloom ,—</l>
       <l n="13">The white cecropia 's silver rind</l>
       <l n="14">Relieved by deeper green behind ,</l>
       <l n="15">The orange with its fruit of gold ,</l>
       <l n="16">The lithe paullinia 's verdant fold ,</l>
       <l n="17">The passion-flower , with symbol holy ,</l>
       <l n="18">Twining its tendrils long and lowly ,</l>
       <l n="19">The rhexias dark , and cassia tall ,</l>
       <l n="20">And proudly rising over all ,</l>
       <l n="21">The kingly palm 's imperial stem ,</l>
       <l n="22">Crowned with its leafy diadem ,</l>
       <l n="23">Star-like , beneath whose sombre shade ,</l>
       <l n="24">The fiery-winged cucullo played !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="25">How lovely was thine aspect , then ,</l>
       <l n="26">Fair island of the Western Sea</l>
       <l n="27">Lavish of beauty , even when</l>
       <l n="28">Thy brutes were happier than thy men ,</l>
       <l n="29">For they , at least , were free !</l>
       <l n="30">Regardless of thy glorious clime ,</l>
       <l n="31">Unmindful of thy soil of flowers ,</l>
       <l n="32">The toiling negro sighed , that Time</l>
       <l n="33">No faster sped his hours .</l>
       <l n="34">For , by the dewy moonlight still ,</l>
       <l n="35">He fed the weary-turning mill ,</l>
       <l n="36">Or bent him in the chill morass ,</l>
       <l n="37">To pluck the long and tangled grass ,</l>
       <l n="38">And hear above his scar-worn back</l>
       <l n="39">The heavy slave-whip 's frequent crack</l>
       <l n="40">While in his heart one evil thought</l>
       <l n="41">In solitary madness wrought ,</l>
       <l n="42">One baleful fire surviving still</l>
       <l n="43">The quenching of the immortal mind ,</l>
       <l n="44">One sterner passion of his kind ,</l>
       <l n="45">Which even fetters could not kill ,</l>
       <l n="46">The savage hope , to deal , erelong ,</l>
       <l n="47">A vengeance bitterer than his wrong !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="48">Hark to that cry ! long , loud , and shrill ,</l>
       <l n="49">From field and forest , rock and hill ,</l>
       <l n="50">Thrilling and horrible it rang ,</l>
       <l n="51">Around , beneath , above ;</l>
       <l n="52">The wild beast from his cavern sprang ,</l>
       <l n="53">The wild bird from her grove !</l>
       <l n="54">Nor fear , nor joy , nor agony</l>
       <l n="55">Were mingled in that midnight cry ;</l>
       <l n="56">But like the lion 's growl of wrath ,</l>
       <l n="57">When falls that hunter in his path</l>
       <l n="58">Whose barbed arrow , deeply set ,</l>
       <l n="59">Is rankling in his bosom yet ,</l>
       <l n="60">It told of hate , full , deep , and strong ,</l>
       <l n="61">Of vengeance kindling out of wrong ;</l>
       <l n="62">It was as if the crimes of years —</l>
       <l n="63">The unrequited toil , the tears ,</l>
       <l n="64">The shame and hate , which liken well</l>
       <l n="65">Earth 's garden to the nether hell —</l>
       <l n="66">Had found in nature 's self a tongue ,</l>
       <l n="67">On which the gathered horror hung ;</l>
       <l n="68">As if from cliff , and stream , and glen</l>
       <l n="69">Burst on the ’ startled ears of men</l>
       <l n="70">That voice which rises unto God ,</l>
       <l n="71">Solemn and stern ,— the cry of blood !</l>
       <l n="72">It ceased , and all was still once more ,</l>
       <l n="73">Save ocean chafing on his shore ,</l>
       <l n="74">The sighing of the wind between</l>
       <l n="75">The broad banana 's leaves of green ,</l>
       <l n="76">Or bough by restless plumage shook ,</l>
       <l n="77">Or murmuring voice of mountain brook .</l>
       <l n="78">Brief was the silence . Once again</l>
       <l n="79">Pealed to the skies that frantic yell ,</l>
       <l n="80">Glowed on the heavens a fiery stain ,</l>
       <l n="81">And flashes rose and fell ;</l>
       <l n="82">And painted on the blood-red sky ,</l>
       <l n="83">Dark , naked arms were tossed on high ;</l>
       <l n="84">And , round the white man 's lordly hall ,</l>
       <l n="85">Trod , fierce and free , the brute he made ;</l>
       <l n="86">And those who crept along the wall ,</l>
       <l n="87">And answered to his lightest call</l>
       <l n="88">With more than spaniel dread ,</l>
       <l n="89">The creatures of his lawless beck ,</l>
       <l n="90">Were trampling on his very neck</l>
       <l n="91">And on the night-air , wild and clear ,</l>
       <l n="92">Rose woman 's shriek of more than fear ;</l>
       <l n="93">For bloodied arms were round her thrown ,</l>
       <l n="94">And dark cheeks pressed against her own !</l>
       <l n="95">Where then was he whose fiery zeal</l>
       <l n="96">Had taught the trampled heart to feel ,</l>
       <l n="97">Until despair itself grew strong ,</l>
       <l n="98">And vengeance fed its torch from wrong ?</l>
       <l n="99">Now , when the thunderbolt is speeding ;</l>
       <l n="100">Now , when oppression 's heart is bleeding ;</l>
       <l n="101">Now , when the latent curse of Time</l>
       <l n="102">Is raining down in fire and blood ,</l>
       <l n="103">That curse which , through long years of crime ,</l>
       <l n="104">Has gathered , drop by drop , its flood ,—</l>
       <l n="105">Why strikes he not , the foremost one ,</l>
       <l n="106">Where murder 's sternest deeds are done ?</l>

       <l n="111">Toussaint L'Ouverture !</l>
       <l n="112">What marvel that his heart beat high !</l>
       <l n="113">The blow for freedom had been given ,</l>
       <l n="114">And blood had answered to the cry</l>
       <l n="115">Which Earth sent up to Heaven !</l>
       <l n="116">What marvel that a fierce delight</l>
       <l n="117">Smiled grimly o'er his brow of night ,</l>
       <l n="118">As groan and shout and bursting flame</l>
       <l n="119">Told where the midnight tempest came ,</l>

       <l n="125">The lowlier and the purer way ,</l>
       <l n="126">In which the Holy Sufferer trod ,</l>
       <l n="127">Meekly amidst the sons of crime ;</l>

     <p>“ The French ship Le Rodeur , with a crew of twenty-two men , and with one hundred and sixty negro slaves , sailed from Bonny , in Africa , April , 1819 . On approaching the line , a terrible malady broke out ,— an obstinate disease of the eyes ,— contagious , and altogether beyond the resources of medicine . It was aggravated by the scarcity of water among the slaves ( only half a wine-glass per day being allowed to an individual ) , and by the extreme impurity of the air in which they breathed . By the advice of the physician , they were brought upon deck occasionally ; but some of the poor wretches , locking themselves in each other 's arms , leaped overboard , in the hope , which so universally prevails among them , of being swiftly transported to their own homes in Africa . To check this , the captain ordered several who were stopped in the attempt to be shot , or hanged , before their companions . The disease extended to the crew ; and one after another were smitten with it , until only one remained unaffected . Yet even this dreadful condition did not preclude calculation : to save the expense of supporting slaves rendered unsalable , and to obtain grounds for a claim against the underwriters , thirty-six of the negroes , having become blind , were thrown into the sea and drowned ! ” Speech of M. Benjamin Constant , in the French Chamber of Deputies , June 17 , 1820 .</p>
     <p>In the midst of their dreadful fears lest the solitary individual , whose sight remained unaffected , should also be seized with the malady , a sail was discovered . It was the Spanish slaver , Leon . The same disease had been there ; and , horrible to tell , all the crew had become blind ! Unable to assist each other , the vessels parted . The Spanish ship has never since been heard of . The Rodeur reached Guadaloupe on the 21st of June ; the only man who had escaped the disease , and had thus been enabled to steer the slaver into port , caught it in three days after its arrival .— Bibliotheque Ophthalmologique for November , 1819 .</p>

     <p>EXPOSTULATION .</p>
     <p>Dr. Charles Follen , a German patriot , who had come to America for the freedom which was denied him in his native land , allied himself with the abolitionists , and at a convention of delegates from all the anti - slavery organizations in New England , held at Boston in May , 1834 , was chairman of a committee to prepare an address to the people of New England . Toward the close of the address occurred the passage which suggested these lines . “ The despotism which our fathers could not bear in their native country is expiring , and the sword of justice in her reformed hands has applied its exterminating edge to slavery . Shall the United States — the free United States , which could not bear the bonds of a king — cradle the bondage which a king is abolishing ? Shall a Republic be less free than a Monarchy ? Shall we , in the vigor and buoyancy of our manhood , be less energetic in righteousness than a kingdom in its age ? ” — Dr. Follen 's Address .</p>
     <p>“ Genius of America !— Spirit of our free institutions !— where art thou ? How art thou fallen , O Lucifer ! son of the morning ,— how art thou fallen from Heaven ! Hell from beneath is moved for thee , to meet thee at thy coming ! The kings of the earth cry out to thee , Aha ! Aha ! Art thou become like unto us ? ” — Speech of Samuel J . May .</p>

      <head>THE PASTORAL LETTER</head>
      <head>The General Association of Congregational ministers in Massachusetts met at Brookfield , June 27 , 1837 , and issued a Pastoral Letter to the churches under its care . The immediate occasion of it was the profound sensation produced by the recent public lecture in Massachusetts by Angelina and Sarah Grimke , two noble women from South Carolina , who bore their testimony against slavery . The Letter demanded that “ the perplexed and agitating subjects which are now common amongst us ... should not be forced upon any church as matters for debate , at the hazard of alienation and division , ” and called attention to the dangers now seeming “ to threaten the female character with widespread and permanent injury . ”</head>

      <head>PENNSYLVANIA HALL .</head>
      <head>Read at the dedication of Pennsylvania Hall , Philadelphia , May 15 , 1838 . The building was erected by an association of gentlemen , irrespective of sect or party , “ that the citizens of Philadelphia should possess a room wherein the principles of Liberty , and Equality of Civil Rights , could be freely discussed , and the evils of slavery fearlessly portrayed . ” On the evening of the 17th it was burned by a mob , destroying the office of the Pennsylvania Freeman , of which I was editor , and with it my books and papers .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">NOT with the splendors of the days of old ,</l>
       <l n="2">The spoil of nations , and barbaric gold ;</l>
       <l n="3">No weapons wrested from the fields of blood ,</l>
       <l n="4">Where dark and stern the unyielding Roman stood ,</l>
       <l n="5">And the proud eagles of his cohorts saw</l>
       <l n="6">A world , war-wasted , crouching to his law ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">Nor blazoned car , nor banners floating gay ,</l>
       <l n="8">Like those which swept along the Appian Way ,</l>
       <l n="9">When , to the welcome of imperial Rome ,</l>
       <l n="10">The victor warrior came in triumph home ,</l>
       <l n="11">And trumpet peal , and shoutings wild and high ,</l>
       <l n="12">Stirred the blue quiet of the Italian sky ;</l>
       <l n="13">But calm and grateful , prayerful and sincere ,</l>
       <l n="14">As Christian freemen only , gathering here ,</l>
       <l n="15">We dedicate our fair and lofty Hall ,</l>
       <l n="16">Pillar and arch , entablature and wall ,</l>
       <l n="17">As Virtue 's shrine , as Liberty 's abode ,</l>
       <l n="18">Sacred to Freedom , and to Freedom 's God</l>
       <l n="19">Far statelier Halls , ‘ neath brighter skies than these ,</l>
       <l n="20">Stood darkly mirrored in the AEgean seas ,</l>
       <l n="21">Pillar and shrine , and life-like statues seen ,</l>
       <l n="22">Graceful and pure , the marble shafts between ;</l>
       <l n="23">Where glorious Athens from her rocky hill</l>
       <l n="24">Saw Art and Beauty subject to her will ;</l>
       <l n="25">And the chaste temple , and the classic grove ,</l>
       <l n="26">The hall of sages , and the bowers of love ,</l>
       <l n="27">Arch , fane , and column , graced the shores , and gave</l>
       <l n="28">Their shadows to the blue Saronic wave ;</l>
       <l n="29">And statelier rose , on Tiber 's winding side ,</l>
       <l n="30">The Pantheon 's dome , the Coliseum 's pride ,</l>
       <l n="31">The Capitol , whose arches backward flung</l>
       <l n="32">The deep , clear cadence of the Roman tongue ,</l>
       <l n="33">Whence stern decrees , like words of fate , went forth</l>
       <l n="34">To the awed nations of a conquered earth ,</l>
       <l n="35">Where the proud Caesars in their glory came ,</l>
       <l n="36">And Brutus lightened from his lips of flame !</l>
       <l n="37">Yet in the porches of Athena 's halls ,</l>
       <l n="38">And in the shadow of her stately walls ,</l>
       <l n="39">Lurked the sad bondman , and his tears of woe</l>
       <l n="40">Wet the cold marble with unheeded flow ;</l>
       <l n="41">And fetters clanked beneath the silver dome</l>
       <l n="42">Of the proud Pantheon of imperious Rome .</l>
       <l n="43">Oh , not for hint , the chained and stricken slave ,</l>
       <l n="44">By Tiber 's shore , or blue AEgina 's wave ,</l>
       <l n="45">In the thronged forum , or the sages ’ seat ,</l>
       <l n="46">The bold lip pleaded , and the warm heart beat ;</l>
       <l n="47">No soul of sorrow melted at his pain ,</l>
       <l n="48">No tear of pity rusted on his chain !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="49">But this fair Hall to Truth and Freedom given ,</l>
       <l n="50">Pledged to the Right before all Earth and Heaven ,</l>
       <l n="51">A free arena for the strife of mind ,</l>
       <l n="52">To caste , or sect , or color unconfined ,</l>
       <l n="53">Shall thrill with echoes such as ne'er of old</l>
       <l n="54">From Roman hall or Grecian temple rolled ;</l>
       <l n="55">Thoughts shall find utterance such as never yet</l>
       <l n="56">The Propylea or the Forum met .</l>
       <l n="57">Beneath its roof no gladiator 's strife</l>
       <l n="58">Shall win applauses with the waste of life ;</l>
       <l n="59">No lordly lictor urge the barbarous game ,</l>
       <l n="60">No wanton Lais glory in her shame .</l>
       <l n="61">But here the tear of sympathy shall flow ,</l>
       <l n="62">As the ear listens to the tale of woe ;</l>
       <l n="63">Here in stern judgment of the oppressor 's wrong</l>
       <l n="64">Shall strong rebukings thrill on Freedom 's tongue ,</l>
       <l n="65">No partial justice hold th ’ unequal scale ,</l>
       <l n="66">No pride of caste a brother 's rights assail ,</l>
       <l n="67">No tyrant 's mandates echo from this wall ,</l>
       <l n="68">Holy to Freedom and the Rights of All !</l>
       <l n="69">But a fair field , where mind may close with mind ,</l>
       <l n="70">Free as the sunshine and the chainless wind ;</l>
       <l n="71">Where the high trust is fixed on Truth alone ,</l>
       <l n="72">And bonds and fetters from the soul are thrown ;</l>
       <l n="73">Where wealth , and rank , and worldly pomp , and might ,</l>
       <l n="74">Yield to the presence of the True and Right .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="75">And fitting is it that this Hall should stand</l>

       <l n="78">The virgin verdure of the wilderness .</l>

       <l n="82">Gathered , in peace , around the home of Penn ,</l>
       <l n="83">Awed by the weapons Love alone had given</l>
       <l n="84">Drawn from the holy armory of Heaven ;</l>

      <head>MASSACHUSETTS TO VIRGINIA .</head>
      <head>Written on reading an account of the proceedings of the citizens of Norfolk , Va ., in reference to George Latimer , the alleged fugitive slave , who was seized in Boston without warrant at the request of James B. Grey , of Norfolk , claiming to be his master . The case caused great excitement North and South , and led to the presentation of a petition to Congress , signed by more than fifty thousand citizens of Massachusetts , calling for such laws and proposed amendments to the Constitution as should relieve the Commonwealth from all further participation in the crime of oppression . George Latimer himself was finally given free papers for the sum of four hundred dollars .</head>

     <p>THE SENTENCE OF JOHN L. BROWN .</p>
     <p>John L. Brown , a young white man of South Carolina , was in 1844 sentenced to death for aiding a young slave woman , whom he loved and had married , to escape from slavery . In pronouncing the sentence Judge O'Neale addressed to the prisoner these words of appalling blasphemy :</p>
     <p>You are to die ! To die an ignominious death — the death on the gallows ! This announcement is , to you , I know , most appalling . Little did you dream of it when you stepped into the bar with an air as if you thought it was a fine frolic . But the consequences of crime are just such as you are realizing . Punishment often comes when it is least expected . Let me entreat you to take the present opportunity to commence the work of reformation . Time will be furnished you to prepare for the great change just before you . Of your past life I know nothing , except what your trial furnished . That told me that the crime for which you are to suffer was the consequence of a want of attention on your part to the duties of life . The strange woman snared you . She flattered you with her word ; and you became her victim . The consequence was , that , led on by a desire to serve her , you committed the offence of aid in a slave to run away and depart from her master 's service ; and now , for it you are to die ! You are a young man , and I fear you have been dissolute ; and if so , these kindred vices have contributed a full measure to your ruin . Reflect on your past life , and make the only useful devotion of the remnant of your days in preparing for death . Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth is the language of inspired wisdom . This comes home appropriately to you in this trying moment . You are young ; quite too young to be where you are . If you had remembered your Creator in your past days , you would not now be in a felon 's place , to receive a felon 's judgment . Still , it is not too late to remember your Creator . He calls early , and He calls late . He stretches out the arms of a Father 's love to you — to the vilest sinner — and says : “ Come unto me and be saved . ” You can perhaps read . If so , read the Scriptures ; read them without note , and without comment ; and pray to God for His assistance ; and you will be able to say when you pass from prison to execution , as a poor slave said under similar circumstances : “ I am glad my Friday has come . ” If you cannot read the Scriptures , the ministers of our holy religion will be ready to aid you . They will read and explain to you until you will be able to understand ; and understanding , to call upon the only One who can help you and save you — Jesus Christ , the Lamb of God , who taketh away the sin of the world . To Him I commend you . And through Him may you have that opening of the Day-Spring of mercy from on high , which shall bless you here , and crown you as a saint in an everlasting world , forever and ever . The sentence of the law is that you be taken hence to the place from whence you came last ; thence to the jail of Fairfield District ; and that there you be closely and securely confined until Friday , the 26th day of April next ; on which day , between the hours of ten in the forenoon and two in the afternoon , you will be taken to the place of public execution , and there be hanged by the neck till your body be dead . And may God have mercy on your soul !</p>
     <p>No event in the history of the anti-slavery struggle so stirred the two hemispheres as did this dreadful sentence . A cry of horror was heard from Europe . In the British House of Lords , Brougham and Denman spoke of it with mingled pathos and indignation . Thirteen hundred clergymen and church officers in Great Britain addressed a memorial to the churches of South Carolina against the atrocity . Indeed , so strong was the pressure of the sentiment of abhorrence and disgust that South Carolina yielded to it , and the sentence was commuted to scourging and banishment .</p>
