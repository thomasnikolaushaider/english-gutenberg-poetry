      <docTitle><titlePart>MAY-DAY . Daughter of Heaven and Earth , coy Spring , With sudden passion languishing , Maketh all things softly smile , Painteth pictures mile on mile , Holds a cup with cowslip-wreaths , Whence a smokeless incense breathes . Girls are peeling the sweet willow , Poplar white , and Gilead-tree , And troops of boys Shouting with whoop and hilloa , And hip , hip three times three . The air is full of whistlings bland ; What was that I heard Out of the hazy land ? Harp of the wind , or song of bird , Or clapping of shepherd 's hands , Or vagrant booming of the air , Voice of a meteor lost in day ? Such tidings of the starry sphere Can this elastic air convey . Or haply ‘ t was the cannonade Of the pent and darkened lake , Cooled by the pendent mountain 's shade , Whose deeps , till beams of noonday break , Afflicted moan , and latest hold Even unto May the iceberg cold . Was it a squirrel 's pettish bark , Or clarionet of jay ? or hark , Where yon wedged line the Nestor leads , Steering north with raucous cry Through tracts and provinces of sky , Every night alighting down In new landscapes of romance , Where darkling feed the clamorous clans By lonely lakes to men unknown . Come the tumult whence it will , Voice of sport , or rush of wings , It is a sound , it is a token That the marble sleep is broken , And a change has passed on things . Beneath the calm , within the light , A hid unruly appetite Of swifter life , a surer hope , Strains every sense to larger scope , Impatient to anticipate The halting steps of aged Fate . Slow grows the palm , too slow the pearl : When Nature falters , fain would zeal Grasp the felloes of her wheel , And grasping give the orbs another whirl . Turn swiftlier round , O tardy ball ! And sun this frozen side , Bring hither back the robin 's call , Bring back the tulip 's pride . Why chidest thou the tardy Spring ? The hardy bunting does not chide ; The blackbirds make the maples ring With social cheer and jubilee ; The redwing flutes his o-ka-lee , The robins know the melting snow ; The sparrow meek , prophetic-eyed , Her nest beside the snow-drift weaves , Secure the osier yet will hide Her callow brood in mantling leaves ; And thou , by science all undone , Why only must thy reason fail To see the southing of the sun ? As we thaw frozen flesh with snow , So Spring will not , foolish fond , Mix polar night with tropic glow , Nor cloy us with unshaded sun , Nor wanton skip with bacchic dance , But she has the temperance Of the gods , whereof she is one ,— Masks her treasury of heat Under east-winds crossed with sleet . Plants and birds and humble creatures Well accept her rule austere ; Titan-born , to hardy natures Cold is genial and dear . As Southern wrath to Northern right Is but straw to anthracite ; As in the day of sacrifice , When heroes piled the pyre , The dismal Massachusetts ice Burned more than others ’ fire , So Spring guards with surface cold The garnered heat of ages old : Hers to sow the seed of bread , That man and all the kinds be fed ; And , when the sunlight fills the hours , Dissolves the crust , displays the flowers . The world rolls round ,— mistrust it not ,— Befalls again what once befell ; All things return , both sphere and mote , And I shall hear my bluebird 's note , And dream the dream of Auburn dell . When late I walked , in earlier days , All was stiff and stark ; Knee-deep snows choked all the ways , In the sky no spark ; Firm-braced I sought my ancient woods , Struggling through the drifted roads ; The whited desert knew me not , Snow-ridges masked each darling spot ; The summer dells , by genius haunted , One arctic moon had disenchanted . All the sweet secrets therein hid By Fancy , ghastly spells undid . Eldest mason , Frost , had piled , With wicked ingenuity , Swift cathedrals in the wild ; The piny hosts were sheeted ghosts In the star-lit minster aisled . I found no joy : the icy wind Might rule the forest to his mind . Who would freeze in frozen brakes ? Back to books and sheltered home , And wood-fire flickering on the walls , To hear , when , ‘ mid our talk and games , Without the baffled north-wind calls . But soft ! a sultry morning breaks ; The cowslips make the brown brook gay ; A happier hour , a longer day . Now the sun leads in the May , Now desire of action wakes , And the wish to roam . The caged linnet in the Spring Hearkens for the choral glee , When his fellows on the wing Migrate from the Southern Sea ; When trellised grapes their flowers unmask , And the new-born tendrils twine , The old wine darkling in the cask Feels the bloom on the living vine , And bursts the hoops at hint of Spring : And so , perchance , in Adam 's race , Of Eden 's bower some dream-like trace Survived the Flight , and swam the Flood , And wakes the wish in youngest blood To tread the forfeit Paradise , And feed once more the exile 's eyes ; And ever when the happy child In May beholds the blooming wild , And hears in heaven the bluebird sing , “ Onward , ” he cries , “ your baskets bring ,— In the next field is air more mild , And o'er yon hazy crest is Eden 's balmier Spring . ” Not for a regiment 's parade , Nor evil laws or rulers made , Blue Walden rolls its cannonade , But for a lofty sign Which the Zodiac threw , That the bondage-days are told , And waters free as winds shall flow . Lo ! how all the tribes combine To rout the flying foe . See , every patriot oak-leaf throws His elfin length upon the snows , Not idle , since the leaf all day Draws to the spot the solar ray , Ere sunset quarrying inches down , And half-way to the mosses brown ; While the grass beneath the rime Has hints of the propitious time , And upward pries and perforates Through the cold slab a thousand gates , Till green lances peering through Bend happy in the welkin blue . April cold with dropping rain Willows and lilacs brings again , The whistle of returning birds , And trumpet-lowing of the herds . The scarlet maple-keys betray What potent blood hath modest May ; What fiery force the earth renews , The wealth of forms , the flush of hues ; Joy shed in rosy waves abroad Flows from the heart of Love , the Lord . Hither rolls the storm of heat ; I feel its finer billows beat Like a sea which me infolds ; Heat with viewless fingers moulds , Swells , and mellows , and matures , Paints , and flavours , and allures , Bird and brier inly warms , Still enriches and transforms , Gives the reed and lily length , Adds to oak and oxen strength , Boils the world in tepid lakes , Burns the world , yet burnt remakes ; Enveloping heat , enchanted robe , Wraps the daisy and the globe , Transforming what it doth infold , Life out of death , new out of old , Painting fawns ’ and leopards ’ fells , Seethes the gulf-encrimsoning shells , Fires garden with a joyful blaze Of tulips in the morning 's rays . The dead log touched bursts into leaf , The wheat-blade whispers of the sheaf . What god is this imperial Heat , Earth 's prime secret , sculpture 's seat ? Doth it bear hidden in its heart Water-line patterns of all art , All figures , organs , hues , and graces ? Is it Daedalus ? is it Love ? Or walks in mask almighty Jove , And drops from Power 's redundant horn All seeds of beauty to be born ? Where shall we keep the holiday , And duly greet the entering May ? Too strait and low our cottage doors , And all unmeet our carpet floors ; Nor spacious court , nor monarch 's hall , Suffice to hold the festival . Up and away ! where haughty woods Front the liberated floods : We will climb the broad-backed hills , Hear the uproar of their joy ; We will mark the leaps and gleams Of the new-delivered streams , And the murmuring rivers of sap Mount in the pipes of the trees , Giddy with day , to the topmost spire , Which for a spike of tender green Bartered its powdery cap ; And the colours of joy in the bird , And the love in its carol heard , Frog and lizard in holiday coats , And turtle brave in his golden spots ; We will hear the tiny roar Of the insects evermore , While cheerful cries of crag and plain Reply to the thunder of river and main . As poured the flood of the ancient sea Spilling over mountain chains , Bending forests as bends the sedge , Faster flowing o'er the plains ,— A world-wide wave with a foaming edge That rims the running silver sheet ,— So pours the deluge of the heat Broad northward o'er the land , Painting artless paradises , Drugging herbs with Syrian spices , Fanning secret fires which glow In columbine and clover-blow , Climbing the northern zones , Where a thousand pallid towns Lie like cockles by the main , Or tented armies on a plain . The million-handed sculptor moulds Quaintest bud and blossom folds , The million-handed painter pours Opal hues and purple dye ; Azaleas flush the island floors , And the tints of heaven reply . Wreaths for the May ! for happy Spring To-day shall all her dowry bring , The love of kind , the joy , the grace , Hymen of element and race , Knowing well to celebrate With song and hue and star and state , With tender light and youthful cheer , The spousals of the new-born year . Lo Love 's inundation poured Over space and race abroad ! Spring is strong and virtuous , Broad-sowing , cheerful , plenteous , Quickening underneath the mould Grains beyond the price of gold . So deep and large her bounties are , That one broad , long midsummer day Shall to the planet overpay The ravage of a year of war . Drug the cup , thou butler sweet , And send the nectar round ; The feet that slid so long on sleet Are glad to feel the ground . Fill and saturate each kind With good according to its mind , Fill each kind and saturate With good agreeing with its fate , Willow and violet , maiden and man . The bitter-sweet , the haunting air , Creepeth , bloweth everywhere ; It preys on all , all prey on it , Blooms in beauty , thinks in wit , Stings the strong with enterprise , Makes travellers long for Indian skies , And where it comes this courier fleet Fans in all hearts expectance sweet , As if to-morrow should redeem The vanished rose of evening 's dream . By houses lies a fresher green , On men and maids a ruddier mien , As if time brought a new relay Of shining virgins every May , And Summer came to ripen maids To a beauty that not fades . The ground-pines wash their rusty green , The maple-tops their crimson tint , On the soft path each track is seen , The girl 's foot leaves its neater print . The pebble loosened from the frost Asks of the urchin to be tost . In flint and marble beats a heart , The kind Earth takes her children 's part , The green lane is the school-boy 's friend , Low leaves his quarrel apprehend , The fresh ground loves his top and ball , The air rings jocund to his call , The brimming brook invites a leap , He dives the hollow , climbs the steep . The youth reads omens where he goes , And speaks all languages the rose . The wood-fly mocks with tiny noise The far halloo of human voice ; The perfumed berry on the spray Smacks of faint memories far away . A subtle chain of countless rings The next unto the farthest brings , And , striving to be man , the worm Mounts through all the spires of form . I saw the bud-crowned Spring go forth , Stepping daily onward north To greet staid ancient cavaliers Filing single in stately train . And who , and who are the travellers ? They were Night and Day , and Day and Night , Pilgrims wight with step forthright . I saw the Days deformed and low , Short and bent by cold and snow ; The merry Spring threw wreaths on them , Flower-wreaths gay with bud and bell ; Many a flower and many a gem , They were refreshed by the smell , They shook the snow from hats and shoon , They put their April raiment on ; And those eternal forms , Unhurt by a thousand storms , Shot up to the height of the sky again , And danced as merrily as young men . I saw them mask their awful glance Sidewise meek in gossamer lids ; And to speak my thought if none forbids . It was as if the eternal gods , Tired of their starry periods , Hid their majesty in cloth Woven of tulips and painted moth . On carpets green the maskers march Below May 's well-appointed arch , Each star , each god , each grace amain , Every joy and virtue speed , Marching duly in her train , And fainting Nature at her need Is made whole again . ‘ T was the vintage-day of field and wood , When magic wine for bards is brewed ; Every tree and stem and chink Gushed with syrup to the brink . The air stole into the streets of towns , And betrayed the fund of joy To the high-school and medalled boy : On from hall to chamber ran , From youth to maid , from boy to man , To babes , and to old eyes as well . ‘ Once more , ’ the old man cried , ‘ ye clouds , Airy turrets purple-piled , Which once my infancy beguiled , Beguile me with the wonted spell . I know ye skilful to convoy The total freight of hope and joy Into rude and homely nooks , Shed mocking lustres on shelf of books , On farmer 's byre , on meadow-pipes , Or on a pool of dancing chips . I care not if the pomps you show Be what they soothfast appear , Or if yon realms in sunset glow Be bubbles of the atmosphere . And if it be to you allowed To fool me with a shining cloud , So only new griefs are consoled By new delights , as old by old , Frankly I will be your guest , Count your change and cheer the best . The world hath overmuch of pain ,— If Nature give me joy again , Of such deceit I 'll not complain . ’ Ah ! well I mind the calendar , Faithful through a thousand years , Of the painted race of flowers , Exact to days , exact to hours , Counted on the spacious dial Yon broidered zodiac girds . I know the pretty almanac Of the punctual coming-back , On their due days , of the birds . I marked them yestermorn , A flock of finches darting Beneath the crystal arch , Piping , as they flew , a march ,— Belike the one they used in parting Last year from yon oak or larch ; Dusky sparrows in a crowd , Diving , darting northward free , Suddenly betook them all , Every one to his hole in the wall , Or to his niche in the apple-tree . I greet with joy the choral trains Fresh from palms and Cuba 's canes . Best gems of Nature 's cabinet , With dews of tropic morning wet , Beloved of children , bards , and Spring , O birds , your perfect virtues bring , Your song , your forms , your rhythmic flight , Your manners for the heart 's delight , Nestle in hedge , or barn , or roof , Here weave your chamber weather-proof , Forgive our harms , and condescend To man , as to a lubber friend , And , generous , teach his awkward race Courage , and probity , and grace ! Poets praise that hidden wine Hid in milk we drew At the barrier of Time , When our life was new . We had eaten fairy fruit , We were quick from head to foot , All the forms we look on shone As with diamond dews thereon . What cared we for costly joys , The Museum 's far-fetched toys ? Gleam of sunshine on the wall Poured a deeper cheer than all The revels of the Carnival . We a pine-grove did prefer To a marble theatre , Could with gods on mallows dine , Nor cared for spices or for wine . Wreaths of mist and rainbow spanned , Arch on arch , the grimmest land ; Whistle of a woodland bird Made the pulses dance , Note of horn in valleys heard Filled the region with romance . None can tell how sweet , How virtuous , the morning air ; Every accent vibrates well ; Not alone the wood-bird 's call , Or shouting boys that chase their ball , Pass the height of minstrel skill , But the ploughman 's thoughtless cry , Lowing oxen , sheep that bleat , And the joiner 's hammer-beat , Softened are above their will . All grating discords melt , No dissonant note is dealt , And though thy voice be shrill Like rasping file on steel , Such is the temper of the air , Echo waits with art and care , And will the faults of song repair . So by remote Superior Lake , And by resounding Mackinac , When northern storms and forests shake , And billows on the long beach break , The artful Air doth separate Note by note all sounds that grate , Smothering in her ample breast All but godlike words , Reporting to the happy ear Only purified accords . Strangely wrought from barking waves , Soft music daunts the Indian braves ,— Convent-chanting which the child Hears pealing from the panther 's cave And the impenetrable wild . One musician is sure , His wisdom will not fail , He has not tasted wine impure , Nor bent to passion frail . Age cannot cloud his memory , Nor grief untune his voice , Ranging down the ruled scale From tone of joy to inward wail , Tempering the pitch of all In his windy cave . He all the fables knows , And in their causes tells ,— Knows Nature 's rarest moods , Ever on her secret broods . The Muse of men is coy , Oft courted will not come ; In palaces and market squares Entreated , she is dumb ; But my minstrel knows and tells The counsel of the gods , Knows of Holy Book the spells , Knows the law of Night and Day , And the heart of girl and boy , The tragic and the gay , And what is writ on Table Round Of Arthur and his peers , What sea and land discoursing say In sidereal years . He renders all his lore In numbers wild as dreams , Modulating all extremes ,— What the spangled meadow saith To the children who have faith ; Only to children children sing , Only to youth will spring be spring . Who is the Bard thus magnified ? When did he sing , and where abide ? Chief of song where poets feast Is the wind-harp which thou seest In the casement at my side . AEolian harp , How strangely wise thy strain ! Gay for youth , gay for youth , ( Sweet is art , but sweeter truth ,) In the hall at summer eve Fate and Beauty skilled to weave . From the eager opening strings Rung loud and bold the song . Who but loved the wind-harp 's note ? How should not the poet doat On its mystic tongue , With its primeval memory , Reporting what old minstrels said Of Merlin locked the harp within ,— Merlin paying the pain of sin , Pent in a dungeon made of air ,— And some attain his voice to hear , Words of pain and cries of fear , But pillowed all on melody , As fits the griefs of bards to be . And what if that all-echoing shell , Which thus the buried Past can tell , Should rive the Future , and reveal What his dread folds would fain conceal ? It shares the secret of the earth , And of the kinds that owe her birth . Speaks not of self that mystic tone , But of the Overgods alone : It trembles to the cosmic breath ,— As it heareth , so it saith ; Obeying meek the primal Cause , It is the tongue of mundane laws : And this , at least , I dare affirm , Since genius too has bound and term , There is no bard in all the choir , Not Homer 's self , the poet sire , Wise Milton 's odes of pensive pleasure , Or Shakspeare , whom no mind can measure , Nor Collins ’ verse of tender pain , Nor Byron 's clarion of disdain , Scott , the delight of generous boys , Or Wordsworth , Pan 's recording voice ,— Not one of all can put in verse , Or to this presence could rehearse , The sights and voices ravishing The boy knew on the hills in Spring , When pacing through the oaks he heard Sharp queries of the sentry-bird , The heavy grouse 's sudden whirr , The rattle of the kingfisher ; Saw bonfires of the harlot flies In the lowland , when day dies ; Or marked , benighted and forlorn , The first far signal-fire of morn . These syllables that Nature spoke , And the thoughts that in him woke , Can adequately utter none Save to his ear the wind-harp lone . And best can teach its Delphian chord How Nature to the soul is moored , If once again that silent string , As erst it wont , would thrill and ring . Not long ago , at eventide , It seemed , so listening , at my side A window rose , and , to say sooth , I looked forth on the fields of youth : I saw fair boys bestriding steeds , I knew their forms in fancy weeds , Long , long concealed by sundering fates , Mates of my youth ,— yet not my mates , Stronger and bolder far than I , With grace , with genius , well attired , And then as now from far admired , Followed with love They knew not of , With passion cold and shy . O joy , for what recoveries rare ! Renewed , I breathe Elysian air , See youth 's glad mates in earliest bloom ,— Break not my dream , obtrusive tomb ! Or teach thou , Spring ! the grand recoil Of life resurgent from the soil Wherein was dropped the mortal spoil . Soft on the south-wind sleeps the haze ! So on thy broad mystic van Lie the opal-coloured days , And waft the miracle to man . Soothsayer of the eldest gods , Repairer of what harms betide , Revealer of the inmost powers Prometheus proffered , Jove denied ; Disclosing treasures more than true , Or in what far to-morrow due ; Speaking by the tongues of flowers , By the ten-tongued laurel speaking , Singing by the oriole songs , Heart of bird the man 's heart seeking ; Whispering hints of treasure hid Under Morn 's unlifted lid , Islands looming just beyond The dim horizon 's utmost bound ;— Who can , like thee , our rags upbraid , Or taunt us with our hope decayed ? Or who like thee persuade , Making the splendour of the air , The morn and sparkling dew , a snare ? Or who resent Thy genius , wiles , and blandishment ?</titlePart></docTitle>
