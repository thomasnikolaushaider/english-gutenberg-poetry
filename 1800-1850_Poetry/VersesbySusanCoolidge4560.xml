    <p>TO J. H. AND E. W. H. Nourished by peaceful suns and gracious dew , Your sweet youth budded and your sweet lives grew , And all the world seemed rose-beset for you . The rose of beauty was your mutual dower , The stainless rose of love , an early flower , The stately blooms of ease and wealth and power . And treading thus on pathways flower-bestrewn , It well might be , that , cold and careless grown , You both had lived for your own joys alone . But , holding all these fair things as in trust . Gently you walked , still scattering on the dust Of harder roads , which others tread , and must ,— Your heritage of brightness , not a ray Of noontide sought you out , but straight away You caught and halved it with some darker day : And as the sweet saint 's loaves were turned , it is said , To roses , so your roses turned to bread , That hungering souls and weary might be fed . Dear friends , my poor words do but paint you wrong , Nor can I utter , in one trivial song , The goodness I have honored for so long . Only this leaf , a single petal flung , One chord from a full harmony unsung , May speak the life-long love that lacks a tongue .</p>

     <item>Verses are not of these ; They bloom on earthly trees , Poised on a low-hung stem , And those may gather them Who cannot fly to where The heavenly gardens are .</item>

    <docTitle><titlePart>VERSES . COMMISSIONED . “ Do their errands ; enter into the sacrifice with them ; be a link yourself in the divine chain , and feel the joy and life of it . ” — ADELINE D. T. WHITNEY What can I do for thee , Beloved , Whose feet so little while ago Trod the same way-side dust with mine , And now up paths I do not know Speed , without sound or sign ? What can I do ? The perfect life All fresh and fair and beautiful Has opened its wide arms to thee ; Thy cup is over-brimmed and full ; Nothing remains for me . I used to do so many things ,— Love thee and chide thee and caress ; Brush little straws from off thy way , Tempering with my poor tenderness The heat of thy short day . Not much , but very sweet to give ; And it is grief of griefs to bear That all these ministries are o'er , And thou , so happy , Love , elsewhere , Never can need me more :— And I can do for thee but this ( Working on blindly , knowing not If I may give thee pleasure so ): Out of my own dull , burdened lot I can arise , and go To sadder lives and darker homes , A messenger , dear heart , from thee Who wast on earth a comforter , And say to those who welcome me , I am sent forth by her . Feeling the while how good it is To do thy errands thus , and think It may be , in the blue , far space , Thou watchest from the heaven 's brink ,— A smile upon my face . And when the day 's work ends with day , And star-eyed evening , stealing in , Waves a cool hand to flying noon , And restless , surging thoughts begin , Like sad bells out of tune , I 'll pray : “ Dear Lord , to whose great love Nor bound nor limit line is set , Give to my darling , I implore , Some new sweet joy not tasted yet , For I can give no more . ” And with the words my thoughts shall climb With following feet the heavenly stair Up which thy steps so lately sped , And , seeing thee so happy there , Come back half comforted . THE CRADLE TOMB IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY . A little , rudely sculptured bed , With shadowing folds of marble lace , And quilt of marble , primly spread And folded round a baby 's face . Smoothly the mimic coverlet , With royal blazonries bedight , Hangs , as by tender fingers set And straightened for the last good-night . And traced upon the pillowing stone A dent is seen , as if to bless The quiet sleep some grieving one Had leaned , and left a soft impress . It seems no more than yesterday Since the sad mother down the stair And down the long aisle stole away , And left her darling sleeping there . But dust upon the cradle lies , And those who prized the baby so , And laid her down to rest with sighs , Were turned to dust long years ago . Above the peaceful pillowed head Three centuries brood , and strangers peep And wonder at the carven bed ,— But not unwept the baby 's sleep , For wistful mother-eyes are blurred With sudden mists , as lingerers stay , And the old dusts are roused and stirred By the warm tear-drops of to-day . Soft , furtive hands caress the stone , And hearts , o'erleaping place and age , Melt into memories , and own A thrill of common parentage . Men die , but sorrow never dies ; The crowding years divide in vain , And the wide world is knit with ties Of common brotherhood in pain ; Of common share in grief and loss , And heritage in the immortal bloom Of Love , which , flowering round its cross , Made beautiful a baby 's tomb .</titlePart></docTitle>

     <p>“ OF SUCH AS I HAVE . ” Love me for what I am , Love . Not for sake Of some imagined thing which I might be , Some brightness or some goodness not in me , Born of your hope , as dawn to eyes that wake Imagined morns before the morning break . If I , to please you ( whom I fain would please ) , Reset myself like new key to old tune , Chained thought , remodelled action , very soon My hand would slip from yours , and by degrees The loving , faulty friend , so close to-day , Would vanish , and another take her place ,— A stranger with a stranger 's scrutinies , A new regard , an unfamiliar face . Love me for what I am , then , if you may ; But , if you cannot ,— love me either way . A PORTRAIT . All sweet and various things do lend themselves And blend and intermix in her rare soul , As chorded notes , which were untuneful else , Clasp each the other in a perfect whole . Within her spirit , dawn , all dewy-pearled , Seems held and folded in by golden noons , While past the sunshine gleams a further world Of deep star-spaces and mysterious moons . Like widths of blowing ocean wet with spray , Like breath of early blooms at morning caught , Like cool airs on the cheek of heated day , Come the fair emanations of her thought . Her movement , like the curving of a vine , Seems an unerring accident of grace , And like a flower 's the subtle change and shine And meaning of her brightly tranquil face . And like a tree , unconscious of her shade , She spreads her helpful branches everywhere For wandering bird or bee , nor is afraid Too many guests shall crowd to harbor there . For she is kinder than all others are , And weak things , sad things , gather where she dwells , To reach and taste her strength and drink of her , As thirsty creatures of clear water-wells . Why vex with words where words are poor and vain ? In one brief sentence lies the riddle 's key , Which those who love her read and read again , Finding each time new meanings : SHE IS SHE !</p>

      <head>THE LEGEND OF KINTU .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">When earth was young and men were few ,</l>
       <l n="2">And all things freshly born and new</l>
       <l n="3">Seemed made for blessing , not for ban ,</l>
       <l n="4">Kintu , the god , appeared as man .</l>
       <l n="5">Clad in the plain white priestly dress ,</l>
       <l n="6">He journeyed through the wilderness ,</l>
       <l n="7">His wife beside . A mild-faced cow</l>
       <l n="8">They drove , and one low-bleating lamb ;</l>
       <l n="9">He bore a ripe banana-bough ,</l>
       <l n="10">And she a root of fruitful yam :</l>
       <l n="11">This was their worldly worth and store ,</l>
       <l n="12">But God can make the little more .</l>
       <l n="13">The glad earth knew his feet ; her mould</l>
       <l n="14">Trembled with quickening thrills , and stirred .</l>
       <l n="15">Miraculous harvests spread and rolled ,</l>
       <l n="16">The orchards shone with ruddy gold ;</l>
       <l n="17">The flocks increased , increased the herd ,</l>
       <l n="18">And a great nation spread and grew</l>
       <l n="19">From the swift lineage of the two ,</l>
       <l n="20">Peopling the solitary place ;</l>
       <l n="21">A fair and strong and fruitful race ,</l>
       <l n="22">Who knew not pain nor want nor grief ,</l>
       <l n="23">And Kintu reigned their lord and chief .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="24">So sped three centuries along ,</l>
       <l n="25">Till Kintu 's sons waxed fierce and strong ;</l>
       <l n="26">They learned to war , they loved to slay ;</l>
       <l n="27">Cruel and dark grew all their faces ;</l>
       <l n="28">Discordant death-cries scared the day ,</l>
       <l n="29">Blood stained the green and holy places ;</l>
       <l n="30">And drunk with lust , with anger hot ,</l>
       <l n="31">His sons mild Kintu heeded not .</l>
       <l n="32">At last the god arose in wrath ,</l>
       <l n="33">His sandals tied , and down the path ,</l>
       <l n="34">His wife beside him , as of yore ,</l>
       <l n="35">He went . A cow , a single lamb</l>
       <l n="36">They took ; one tuber of the yam ;</l>
       <l n="37">One yellow-podded branch they bore</l>
       <l n="38">Of ripe banana ,— these , no more ,</l>
       <l n="39">Of all the heaped-up harvest store .</l>
       <l n="40">They left the huts , they left the tent ,</l>
       <l n="41">Nor turned , nor cast a backward look :</l>
       <l n="42">Behind , the thick boughs met and shook .</l>
       <l n="43">They vanished . Long with wild lament</l>
       <l n="44">Mourned all the tribe , in vain , in vain ;</l>
       <l n="45">The gift once given was given no more ,</l>
       <l n="46">The grieved god came not again .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="47">To what far paradise they fared ,</l>
       <l n="48">That heavenly pair , what wilderness</l>
       <l n="49">Their gentle rule next owned and shared ,</l>
       <l n="50">Knoweth no man ,— no man can guess .</l>
       <l n="51">On secret roads , by pathways blind ,</l>
       <l n="52">The gods go forth , and none may find ;</l>
       <l n="53">But sad the world where God is not !</l>
       <l n="54">By man was Kintu soon forgot ,</l>
       <l n="55">Or named and held as legend dim ,</l>
       <l n="56">But the wronged earth , remembering him ,</l>
       <l n="57">By scanty fruit and tardy grain</l>
       <l n="58">And silent song revealed her pain .</l>
       <l n="59">So centuries came , and centuries went ,</l>
       <l n="60">And heaped the graves and filled the tent .</l>
       <l n="61">Kings rose , and fought their royal way</l>
       <l n="62">To conquest over heaps of slain ,</l>
       <l n="63">And reigned a little . Then , one day ,</l>
       <l n="64">They vanished into dust again .</l>
       <l n="65">And other kings usurped their place ,</l>
       <l n="66">Who called themselves of Kintu 's race ,</l>
       <l n="67">And worshipped Kintu ; not as he ,</l>
       <l n="68">The mild , benignant deity ,</l>
       <l n="69">Who held all life a holy thing ,</l>
       <l n="70">Be it of insect or of king ,</l>
       <l n="71">Would have ordained , but with wild rite ,</l>
       <l n="72">With altars heaped , and dolorous cries ,</l>
       <l n="73">And savage dance , and bale-fires light ,</l>
       <l n="74">An unaccepted sacrifice .</l>
       <l n="75">At last , when thousand years were flown ,</l>
       <l n="76">The great Ma-anda filled the throne :</l>
       <l n="77">A prince of generous heart and high ,</l>
       <l n="78">Impetuous , noble , fierce , and true ;</l>
       <l n="79">His wrath like lightning hurtling by ,</l>
       <l n="80">His pardon like the healing dew .</l>
       <l n="81">And chiefs and sages swore each one</l>
       <l n="82">He was great Kintu 's worthiest son .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="83">One night , in forests still and deep ,</l>
       <l n="84">A shepherd sat to watch his sheep ,</l>
       <l n="85">And started , as through darkness dim</l>
       <l n="86">A strange voice rang and calmed to him :</l>
       <l n="87">“ Wake ! there are wonders waiting thee !</l>
       <l n="88">Go where the thick mimosas be ,</l>
       <l n="89">Fringing a little open plain ,</l>
       <l n="90">Honor and power wouldest thou gain ?</l>
       <l n="91">Go , foolish man , to fortune blind ;</l>
       <l n="92">Follow the stream , and thou shall find . ”</l>
       <l n="93">Three several nights the voice was heard ,</l>
       <l n="94">Louder and more emphatic grown .</l>
       <l n="95">Then , at the thrice-repeated word ,</l>
       <l n="96">The shepherd rose and went alone ,</l>
       <l n="97">Threading the mazes of the stream</l>
       <l n="98">Like one who wanders in a dream .</l>
       <l n="99">Long miles he ran , the stream beside ,</l>
       <l n="100">Which this way , that way , turned and sped ,</l>
       <l n="101">And called and sang , a noisy guide .</l>
       <l n="102">At last its vagrant dances led</l>
       <l n="103">To where the thick mimosas ’ shade</l>
       <l n="104">Circled and fringed an open glade ;</l>
       <l n="105">There the wild streamlet danced away ,</l>
       <l n="106">The moon was shining strangely white ,</l>
       <l n="107">And by its fitful , gleaming ray</l>
       <l n="108">The shepherd saw a wondrous sight ;</l>
       <l n="109">In the glade 's midst , each on his mat ,</l>
       <l n="110">A group of armed warriors sat ,</l>
       <l n="111">White-robed , majestic , with deep eyes</l>
       <l n="112">Fixed on him with a stern surprise ;</l>
       <l n="113">And in their midst an aged chief</l>
       <l n="114">Enthroned sat , whose beard , like foam ,</l>
       <l n="115">Caressed his mighty knees . As leaf</l>
       <l n="116">Shakes in the wind the shepherd shook ,</l>
       <l n="117">And veiled his eyes before that look ,</l>
       <l n="118">And prayed , and thought upon his home ,</l>
       <l n="119">Nor spoke , nor moved , till the old man ,</l>
       <l n="120">In voice like waterfall , began :</l>
       <l n="121">“ Shepherd , how names himself thy king ? ”</l>
       <l n="122">“ Ma-anda , ” answered , shuddering ,</l>
       <l n="123">The shepherd . “ Good , thou speakest well .</l>
       <l n="124">And now , my son , I bid thee tell</l>
       <l n="125">Thy first king 's name . ” “ It was Kintu . ”</l>
       <l n="126">“ ‘ Tis rightly said , thou answerest true .</l>
       <l n="127">Hark ! To Ma-anda , Kintu 's son ,</l>
       <l n="128">Hasten , and bid him , fearing naught ,</l>
       <l n="129">Come hither , taking thee for guide ;</l>
       <l n="130">Thou and he , not another one ,</l>
       <l n="131">Not even a dog may run beside !</l>
       <l n="132">Long has Ma-anda Kintu sought</l>
       <l n="133">With spell and conjuration dim ,</l>
       <l n="134">Now Kintu has a word for him .</l>
       <l n="135">Go , do thy errand , haste thee hence ,</l>
       <l n="136">Kintu insures thy recompense . ”</l>
       <l n="137">All night the shepherd ran , star-led ,</l>
       <l n="138">All the hot day he hastened straight ,</l>
       <l n="139">Nor stopped for sleep , nor stopped for bread ,</l>
       <l n="140">Until he reached the city gate ,</l>
       <l n="141">And saw red rays of evening fall</l>
       <l n="142">On the leaf-hutted capital .</l>
       <l n="143">He sought the king , his tale he told .</l>
       <l n="144">Ma-anda faltered not , nor stayed .</l>
       <l n="145">He seized his spear , he left the tent :</l>
       <l n="146">Shook off the brown arms of his queens ,</l>
       <l n="147">Who clasped his knees with wailing screams ;</l>
       <l n="148">On pain of instant death forbade</l>
       <l n="149">That man should spy or follow him ;</l>
       <l n="150">And down the pathway , arching dim ,</l>
       <l n="151">Fearless and light of heart and bold</l>
       <l n="152">Followed the shepherd where he went .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="153">But one there was who loved his king</l>
       <l n="154">Too well to suffer such strange thing ,—</l>
       <l n="155">The chieftain of the host was he ,</l>
       <l n="156">Next to the monarch in degree ;</l>
       <l n="157">And , fearing wile or stratagem</l>
       <l n="158">Menaced the king , he followed them</l>
       <l n="159">With noiseless tread and out of sight .</l>
       <l n="160">So on they fared the forest through ,</l>
       <l n="161">From evening shades to dawning light ,</l>
       <l n="162">From damning to the dusk and dew ,—</l>
       <l n="163">The unseen follower and the two .</l>
       <l n="164">Ofttimes the king turned back to scan</l>
       <l n="165">The path , but never saw he man .</l>
       <l n="166">At last the forest-guarded space</l>
       <l n="167">They reached , where , ranged in order , sat ,</l>
       <l n="168">Each couched upon his braided mat ,</l>
       <l n="169">The white-robed warriors , face to face</l>
       <l n="170">With their majestic chief . The king ,</l>
       <l n="171">Albeit unused to fear or awe ,</l>
       <l n="172">Bowed down in homage , wondering ,</l>
       <l n="173">And bent his eyes , as fearing to be</l>
       <l n="174">Blinded by rays of deity .</l>
       <l n="175">Then asked the mighty voice and calm ,</l>
       <l n="176">“ Art thou Ma-anda called ? ” “ I am . ”</l>
       <l n="177">“ And art thou king ? ” “ The king am I , ”</l>
       <l n="178">The bold Ma-anda made reply .</l>
       <l n="179">“ Tis rightly spoken ; but , my son ,</l>
       <l n="180">Why hast thou my command forgot ,</l>
       <l n="181">That no man with thee to this spot</l>
       <l n="182">Should come , except thy guide alone ? ”</l>
       <l n="183">“ No man has come , ” Ma-anda said .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="184">“ Alone we journeyed , he and I ;</l>
       <l n="185">And often have I turned my head ,</l>
       <l n="186">And never living thing could spy .</l>
       <l n="187">None is there , on my faith as king . ”</l>
       <l n="188">“ A king 's word is a weighty thing , ”</l>
       <l n="189">The old man answered . “ Let it be ,—</l>
       <l n="190">But still a man HAS followed thee !</l>
       <l n="191">Now answer , Ma-anda , one more thing :</l>
       <l n="192">Who , first of all thy line , was king ? ”</l>
       <l n="193">“ Kintu the god . ” “ ‘ Tis well , my son ,</l>
       <l n="194">All creatures Kintu loved ,— not one</l>
       <l n="195">Too pitiful or weak or small ;</l>
       <l n="196">He knew them and he loved them all ;</l>
       <l n="197">And never did a living thing ,</l>
       <l n="198">Or bird in air or fish in lake ,</l>
       <l n="199">Endure a pang for Kintu 's sake .</l>
       <l n="200">Then rose his sons , of differing mind ,</l>
       <l n="201">Who gorged on cruel feasts each day ,</l>
       <l n="202">And bathed in blood , and joyed to slay ,</l>
       <l n="203">And laughed at pain and suffering .</l>
       <l n="204">Then Kintu sadly went his way .</l>
       <l n="205">The gods long-suffering are and kind ,</l>
       <l n="206">Often they pardon , long they wait ;</l>
       <l n="207">But men are evil , men are blind .</l>
       <l n="208">After much tarriance , much debate ,</l>
       <l n="209">The good gods leave them to their fate ;</l>
       <l n="210">So Kintu went where none may find .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="211">Each king in turn has sought since then ,</l>
       <l n="212">From Chora down , the first in line ,</l>
       <l n="213">To win lost Kintu back to men .</l>
       <l n="214">Vain was his search , and vain were thine ,</l>
       <l n="215">Save that the gods have special grace</l>
       <l n="216">To thee , Ma-anda . Face to face</l>
       <l n="217">With Kintu thou shall stand , and he</l>
       <l n="218">Shall speak the word of power to thee ;</l>
       <l n="219">Clasped to his bosom , thou shall share</l>
       <l n="220">His knowledge of the earth , the air ,</l>
       <l n="221">And deep things , secret things , shall learn .</l>
       <l n="222">But stay , ” — the old man 's voice grew stern ,—</l>
       <l n="223">“ Before I further speak , declare</l>
       <l n="224">Who is that man in ambush there ! ”</l>
       <l n="225">“ There is no man ,— no man I see . ”</l>
       <l n="226">“ Deny no longer , it is vain .</l>
       <l n="227">Within the shadow of the tree</l>
       <l n="228">He lurketh ; lo , behold him plain ! ”</l>
       <l n="229">And the king saw ;— for at the word</l>
       <l n="230">From covert stole the hidden spy ,</l>
       <l n="231">And sought his monarch 's side . One cry ,</l>
       <l n="232">A lion 's roar , Ma-anda gave ,</l>
       <l n="233">Then seized his spear , and poised and drave .</l>
       <l n="234">Like lightning bolt it hissed and whirred ,</l>
       <l n="235">A flash across the midnight blue .</l>
       <l n="236">A single groan , a jet of red ,</l>
       <l n="237">And , pierced and stricken through and through ,</l>
       <l n="238">Upon the ground the chief fell dead ;</l>
       <l n="239">But still with love no death could chase ,</l>
       <l n="240">His eyes sought out his master 's face .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="241">Blent with Ma-anda 's a wild cry</l>
       <l n="242">Of many voices rose on high ,</l>
       <l n="243">A shriek of anguish and despair .</l>
       <l n="244">Which shook and filled the startled air ;</l>
       <l n="245">And when the king , his wrath still hot ,</l>
       <l n="246">Turned him , the little grassy plain</l>
       <l n="247">All lonely in the moonlight lay :</l>
       <l n="248">The chiefs had vanished all away</l>
       <l n="249">As melted into thin , blue wind ;</l>
       <l n="250">Gone was the old man . Stunned and blind ,</l>
       <l n="251">For a long moment stood the king ;</l>
       <l n="252">He tried to wake ; he rubbed his eyes ,</l>
       <l n="253">As though some fearful dream to end .</l>
       <l n="254">It was no dream , this fearful thing :</l>
       <l n="255">There was the forest , there the skies ,</l>
       <l n="256">The shepherd — and his murdered friend .</l>
       <l n="257">With feverish haste , bewildered , mazed ,</l>
       <l n="258">This way and that he vainly sped ,</l>
       <l n="259">Beating the air like one half crazed ;</l>
       <l n="260">With prayers and cries unnumbered ,</l>
       <l n="261">Searching , imploring ,— vain , all vain .</l>
       <l n="262">Only the echoing woods replied ,</l>
       <l n="263">With mocking booms their long aisles through ,</l>
       <l n="264">“ Come back , Kintu , Kintu , Kintu ! ”</l>
       <l n="265">And pitiless to all his pain</l>
       <l n="266">The unanswering gods his suit denied .</l>
       <l n="267">At last , as dawning slowly crept</l>
       <l n="268">To day , the king sank down and wept</l>
       <l n="269">A space ; then , lifting as they could</l>
       <l n="270">The lifeless burden , once a man ,</l>
       <l n="271">He and the shepherd-guide began</l>
       <l n="272">Their grievous journey through the wood ,</l>
       <l n="273">The long and hard and dreary way ,</l>
       <l n="274">Trodden so lightly yesterday ;</l>
       <l n="275">And the third day , at evening 's fall ,</l>
       <l n="276">Gained the leaf-hutted capital .</l>
       <l n="277">There burial rites were duly paid :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="278">Like bridegroom decked for banqueting ,</l>
       <l n="279">The chief adorned his funeral-pyre ;</l>

       <l n="281">Perfumes and every precious thing ;</l>
       <l n="282">And songs were sung , and prayers were prayed ,</l>

       <l n="17">And then a palace , with wide rooms</l>

       <l n="1">All green and fair the Summer lies ,</l>
       <l n="2">Just budded from the bud of Spring ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="13">Tinged with the fatal hectic flush</l>

       <l n="21">As mid the bloom and tenderness</l>
