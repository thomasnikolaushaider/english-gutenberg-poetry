   <head>THE THANKLESS MUSE</head>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">The muses ring my bell and run away .</l>
     <l n="3">I spy you , rogues , behind the evergreen :</l>
     <l n="4">You , wild Thalia , romper in the hay ;</l>
     <l n="5">And you , Terpsichore , you long-legged quean .</l>
     <l n="6">When I was young you used to come and stay ,</l>
     <l n="7">But , now that I grow older , ‘ tis well seen</l>
     <l n="8">What tricks ye put upon me . Well-a-day !</l>
     <l n="9">How many a summer evening have ye been</l>
     <l n="10">Sitting about my door-step , fain to sing</l>
     <l n="11">And tell old tales , while through the fragrant dark</l>
     <l n="12">Burned the large planets , throbbed the brooding sound</l>
     <l n="13">Of crickets and the tree-toads ’ ceaseless ring ;</l>
     <l n="14">And in the meads the fire-fly lit her spark</l>
     <l n="15">Where from my threshold sank the vale profound .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="16">So late and long the shadows lie</l>
     <l n="17">Under the quadrangle wall :</l>
     <l n="18">From such a narrow strip of sky</l>
     <l n="19">So scant an hour the sunbeams fall ,</l>
     <l n="20">They hardly come to touch at all</l>
     <l n="21">This cool , sequestered corner where ,</l>
     <l n="22">Beside the chapel belfry tall ,</l>
     <l n="23">I cultivate my small parterre .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="24">Poor , sickly blooms of Academe ,</l>
     <l n="25">Recluses of the college close ,</l>
     <l n="26">Whose nun-like pallor would beseem</l>
     <l n="27">The violet better than the rose :</l>
     <l n="28">There 's not a bud among you blows</l>
     <l n="29">With scent or hue to lure the bee :</l>
     <l n="30">Only the thorn that on you grows —</l>
     <l n="31">Only the thorn grows hardily .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="32">Pale cloisterers , have you lost so soon</l>
     <l n="33">The way to blush ? Do you forget</l>
     <l n="34">How once , beneath the enamored moon ,</l>
     <l n="35">You climbed against the parapet ,</l>
     <l n="36">To touch the breast of Juliet</l>
     <l n="37">Warm with a kiss , wet with a tear ,</l>
     <l n="38">In gardens of the Capulet ,</l>
     <l n="39">Far south , my flowers , not here — not here ?</l>
    </lg>
    <p>THE WINDS OF DAWN</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="40">Whither do ye blow ?</l>
     <l n="41">For now the moon is low .</l>
     <l n="42">Whence is it that ye come ,</l>
     <l n="43">And where is it ye go ?</l>
     <l n="44">All night the air was still ,</l>
     <l n="45">The crickets ’ song was shrill ;</l>
     <l n="46">But now there runs a hum</l>
     <l n="47">And rustling through the trees .</l>
     <l n="48">A breath of coolness wakes ,</l>
     <l n="49">As on Canadian lakes ,</l>
     <l n="50">And on Atlantic seas ,</l>
     <l n="51">And each high Alpine lawn</l>
     <l n="52">Begin the winds of dawn .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>ANACREONTIC</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="53">I would not be</l>
     <l n="54">A voyager on the windy seas :</l>
     <l n="55">More sweet to me</l>
     <l n="56">This bank where crickets chirp , and bees</l>
     <l n="57">Buzz drowsy sunshine minstrelsies .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="58">I would not bide</l>
     <l n="59">On lonely heights where shepherds dwell .</l>
     <l n="60">At twilight tide</l>
     <l n="61">The sounds that from the valley swell ,</l>
     <l n="62">Soft breathing lute and herdsman 's bell ,</l>
     <l n="63">Are sweeter far</l>
     <l n="64">Than music of cold mountain rills .</l>
     <l n="65">The evening star</l>
     <l n="66">Wakes love and song below , but chills</l>
     <l n="67">With mist and breeze the gloomy hills .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="68">I would not woo</l>
     <l n="69">Some storm-browed Juno , queenly fair .</l>
     <l n="70">Soft eyes of blue</l>
     <l n="71">And sudden blushes unaware</l>
     <l n="72">Do net my heart in silken snare .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="73">I do not love</l>
     <l n="74">The eyrie , but low woodland nest</l>
     <l n="75">Of cushat dove :</l>
     <l n="76">Not wind , but calm ; not toil , but rest</l>
     <l n="77">And sleep in grassy meadow 's breast .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>BUMBLE BEE</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="78">As I lay yonder in tall grass</l>
     <l n="79">A drunken bumble-bee went past</l>
     <l n="80">Delirious with honey toddy .</l>
     <l n="81">The golden sash about his body</l>
     <l n="82">Could scarce keep in his swollen belly</l>
     <l n="83">Distent with honey-suckle jelly .</l>
     <l n="84">Rose liquor and the sweet pea wine</l>
     <l n="85">Had filled his soul with song divine ;</l>
     <l n="86">Deep had he drunk the warm night through :</l>
     <l n="87">His hairy thighs were wet with dew .</l>
     <l n="88">Full many an antic he had played</l>
     <l n="89">While the world went round through sleep and shade .</l>
     <l n="90">Oft had he lit with thirsty lip</l>
     <l n="91">Some flower-cup 's nectared sweets to sip ,</l>
     <l n="92">When on smooth petals he would slip</l>
     <l n="93">Or over tangled stamens trip ,</l>
     <l n="94">And headlong in the pollen rolled ,</l>
     <l n="95">Crawl out quite dusted o'er with gold .</l>
     <l n="96">Or else his heavy feet would stumble</l>
     <l n="97">Against some bud and down he 'd tumble</l>
     <l n="98">Amongst the grass ; there lie and grumble</l>
     <l n="99">In low , soft bass — poor maudlin bumble !</l>
     <l n="100">With tipsy hum on sleepy wing</l>
     <l n="101">He buzzed a glee — a bacchic thing</l>
     <l n="102">Which , wandering strangely in the moon ,</l>
     <l n="103">He learned from grigs that sing in June ,</l>
     <l n="104">Unknown to sober bees who dwell</l>
     <l n="105">Through the dark hours in waxen cell .</l>
     <l n="106">When south wind floated him away</l>
     <l n="107">The music of the summer day</l>
     <l n="108">Lost something : sure it was a pain</l>
     <l n="109">To miss that dainty star-light strain .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>WATER LILIES AT SUNSET</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="110">Mine eyes have seen when once at sunset hour</l>
     <l n="111">White lily flocks that edged a lonely lake</l>
     <l n="112">All rose and sank upon the lifting swell</l>
     <l n="113">That swayed their long stems lazily , and lapped</l>
     <l n="114">Their floating pads and stirred among the leaves .</l>
     <l n="115">And when the sun from western gates of day</l>
     <l n="116">Poured colored flames , they , kissed to ruddy shame ,</l>
     <l n="117">So blushed through snowy petals , that they glowed</l>
     <l n="118">Like roses morning-blown in dewy bowers ,</l>
     <l n="119">When garden-walks lie dark with early shade .</l>
     <l n="120">That so their perfumed chalices were brimmed</l>
     <l n="121">With liquid glory till they overflowed</l>
     <l n="122">And spilled rich lights and purple shadows out ,</l>
     <l n="123">That splashed the pool with gold , and stained its waves</l>
     <l n="124">In tints of violet and ruby blooms .</l>
     <l n="125">But when the flashing gem that lit the day</l>
     <l n="126">Dropped in its far blue casket of the hills ,</l>
     <l n="127">The rainbow paintings faded from the mere ,</l>
     <l n="128">The wine-dark shades grew black , the gilding dimmed ,</l>
     <l n="129">While , paling slow through tender amber hues ,</l>
     <l n="130">The crimsoned lilies blanched to coldest white ,</l>
     <l n="131">And wanly shivered in the evening breeze .</l>
     <l n="132">When twilight closed — when earliest dew-drops fell</l>
     <l n="133">All frosty-chill deep down their golden hearts ,</l>
     <l n="134">They shrank at that still touch , as maidens shrink ,</l>
     <l n="135">When love 's first footstep frights with sweet alarms</l>
     <l n="136">The untrod wildness of their virgin breasts ;</l>
     <l n="137">Then shut their ivory cups , and dipping low</l>
     <l n="138">Their folded beauties in the gloomy wave ,</l>
     <l n="139">They nodded drowsily and heaved in sleep .</l>
     <l n="140">But sweeter far than summer dreams at dawn ,</l>
     <l n="141">Their mingled breaths from out the darkness stole ,</l>
     <l n="142">Across the silent lake , the winding shores ,</l>
     <l n="143">The shadowy hills that rose in lawny slopes ,</l>
     <l n="144">The marsh among whose reeds the wild fowl screamed ,</l>
     <l n="145">And dusky woodlands where the night came down .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>BETWEEN THE FLOWERS</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="146">An open door and door-steps wide ,</l>
     <l n="147">With pillared vines on either side ,</l>
     <l n="148">And terraced flowers , stair over stair ,</l>
     <l n="149">Standing in pots of earthenware</l>
     <l n="150">Where stiff processions filed around —</l>
     <l n="151">Black on the smooth , sienna ground .</l>
     <l n="152">Tubers and bulbs now blossomed there</l>
     <l n="153">Which , in the moisty hot-house air ,</l>
     <l n="154">Lay winter long in patient rows ,</l>
     <l n="155">Glassed snugly in from Christmas snows :</l>
     <l n="156">Tuberoses , with white , waxy gems</l>
     <l n="157">In bunches on their reed-like stems ;</l>
     <l n="158">Their fragrance forced by art too soon</l>
     <l n="159">To mingle with the sweets of June .</l>
     <l n="160">( So breathes the thin blue smoke , that steals</l>
     <l n="161">From ashes of the gilt pastilles ,</l>
     <l n="162">Burnt slowly , as the brazier swings ,</l>
     <l n="163">In dim saloons of eastern kings . )</l>
     <l n="164">I saw the calla 's arching cup</l>
     <l n="165">With yellow spadix standing up ,</l>
     <l n="166">Its liquid scents to stir and mix —</l>
     <l n="167">The goldenest of toddy-sticks ;</l>
     <l n="168">Roses and purple fuchsia drops ;</l>
     <l n="169">Camellias , which the gardener crops</l>
     <l n="170">To make the sickening wreaths that lie</l>
     <l n="171">On coffins when our loved ones die .</l>
     <l n="172">These all and many more were there ;</l>
     <l n="173">Monsters and grandifloras rare ,</l>
     <l n="174">With tropical broad leaves , grown rank ,</l>
     <l n="175">Drinking the waters of the tank</l>
     <l n="176">Wherein the lotus-lilies bathe ;</l>
     <l n="177">All curious forms of spur and spathe ,</l>
     <l n="178">Pitcher and sac and cactus-thorn ,</l>
     <l n="179">There in the fresh New England morn .</l>
     <l n="180">But where the sun came colored through</l>
     <l n="181">Translucent petals wet with dew ,</l>
     <l n="182">The interspace was carpeted</l>
     <l n="183">With oriel lights and nodes of red ,</l>
     <l n="184">Orange and blue and violet ,</l>
     <l n="185">That wove strange figures , as they met ,</l>
     <l n="186">Of airier tissue , brighter blooms</l>
     <l n="187">Than tumble from the Persian looms .</l>
     <l n="188">So at the pontiff 's feasts , they tell ,</l>
     <l n="189">From the board 's edge the goblet fell ,</l>
     <l n="190">Spilled from its throat the purple tide</l>
     <l n="191">And stained the pavement far and wide .</l>
     <l n="192">Such steps wise Sheba trod upon</l>
     <l n="193">Up to the throne of Solomon ;</l>
     <l n="194">So bright the angel-crowded steep</l>
     <l n="195">Which Israel 's vision scaled in sleep .</l>
     <l n="196">What one is she whose feet shall dare</l>
     <l n="197">Tread that illuminated stair ?</l>
     <l n="198">Like Sheba , queen ; like angels , fair ?</l>
     <l n="199">Oh listen ! In the morning air</l>
     <l n="200">The blossoms all are hanging still —</l>
     <l n="201">The queen is standing on the sill .</l>
     <l n="202">No Sheba she ; her virgin zone</l>
     <l n="203">Proclaims her royalty alone :</l>
     <l n="204">( Such royalty the lions own . )</l>
     <l n="205">Yet all too cheap the patterned stone</l>
     <l n="206">That paves kings ’ palaces , to feel</l>
     <l n="207">The pressure of her gaiter 's heel .</l>
     <l n="208">The girlish grace that lit her face</l>
     <l n="209">Made sunshine in a dusky place —</l>
     <l n="210">The old silk hood , demure and quaint ,</l>
     <l n="211">Wherein she seemed an altar-saint</l>
     <l n="212">Fresh-tinted , though in setting old</l>
     <l n="213">Of dingy carving and tarnished gold ;</l>
     <l n="214">Her eyes , the candles in that shrine ,</l>
     <l n="215">Making Madonna 's face to shine .</l>
     <l n="216">Lingering I passed , but evermore</l>
     <l n="217">Abide with me the open door ,</l>
     <l n="218">The doorsteps wide , the flowers that stand</l>
     <l n="219">In brilliant ranks on either hand ,</l>
     <l n="220">The two white pillars and the vine</l>
     <l n="221">Of bitter-sweet and lush woodbine ,</l>
     <l n="222">And — from my weary paths as far</l>
     <l n="223">As Sheba or the angels are —</l>
     <l n="224">Between , upon the wooden sill ,</l>
     <l n="225">Thou , Queen of Hearts , art standing still .</l>
    </lg>
    <p>AS YOU LIKE IT</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="226">Here while I read the light forsakes the pane ;</l>
     <l n="227">Metempsychosis of the twilight gray —</l>
     <l n="228">Into green aisles of Epping or Ardenne</l>
     <l n="229">The level lines of print stretch far away .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">

     <l n="533">Of cat-tails , midway in the swamp I found</l>
     <l n="534">A small green mead of dry but spongy ground ,</l>

     <l n="536">Full to the brim of thick lethean juices ,</l>
     <l n="537">The filterings of the marsh . With line and hook</l>

     <l n="541">A little isle of foreign soil it seemed ,</l>

     <l n="545">Yes , many a pretty secret hast thou shown</l>
     <l n="546">To me , O Beaver Pond , walking alone</l>
     <l n="547">On summer afternoons , while yet the swallow</l>

     <l n="551">The golden-rod is rusted , and the red</l>

     <l n="553">Only the sumach 's garnet pompons make</l>
     <l n="554">Procession through the melancholy brake .</l>
     <l n="555">Lo ! even now the autumnal wind blows cool</l>
     <l n="556">Over the rippled waters of thy pool ,</l>
     <l n="557">And red autumnal sunset colors brood</l>

     <l n="664">Sudden I seemed to hear a song :</l>

     <l n="666">As though the inarticulate main</l>
     <l n="667">Had found a voice whose human tone</l>

     <l n="670">Its gentle lapping on the shore ;</l>
     <l n="671">Its noise of subterranean waves</l>
     <l n="672">That grumble in the sea-cliff caves ;</l>
     <l n="673">Its whish among the drifting miles</l>
     <l n="674">Of gulf-weed from the Indian Isles :—</l>
     <l n="675">All — all the harmonies were there</l>
     <l n="676">Which ocean makes with earth or air .</l>
     <l n="677">Turning I saw a sunken ledge</l>
     <l n="678">Bared by the ebb , along whose edge</l>
     <l n="679">The matted sea-weed dripped : thereon ,</l>
     <l n="680">Betwixt the dazzle of the sun</l>
     <l n="681">And the blue shimmer of the sea ,</l>
     <l n="682">I saw — or else I seemed to see</l>
     <l n="683">A mermaid , crooning a wild song ,</l>
     <l n="684">Combing with arm uplifted long</l>
     <l n="685">The hair that shed its meshes black</l>
     <l n="686">Down the slope whiteness of her back .</l>
     <l n="687">She held a mirror in her hand ,</l>
     <l n="688">Wherein she viewed sky , sea , and land ,</l>
     <l n="689">Her beauty 's background and its frame .</l>
     <l n="690">But now , as toward the rock I came ,</l>
     <l n="691">All suddenly across the glass</l>
     <l n="692">Some startling image seemed to pass ;</l>
     <l n="693">For her song rose into a scream ,</l>
     <l n="694">Over her shoulders one swift gleam</l>
     <l n="695">Of eyes unearthly fell on me ,</l>
     <l n="696">And , ‘ twixt the flashing of the sea</l>
     <l n="697">And the blind dazzle of the sun ,</l>
     <l n="698">I saw the rock , but thereupon</l>
     <l n="699">She sat no longer ‘ gainst the blue ;</l>
     <l n="700">Only across the reef there flew</l>
     <l n="701">One snow-white tern and vanished too .</l>
     <l n="702">But , coasting that lone island round ,</l>
     <l n="703">Among the slippery kelp I found</l>
     <l n="704">A little oval glass that lay</l>
     <l n="705">Upturned and flashing in the ray</l>
     <l n="706">Of the down-looking sun . Thereto</l>
     <l n="707">With scarce believing eyes I drew</l>
     <l n="708">And took it captive</l>
     <l n="709">A while there</l>
     <l n="710">I rested in the mermaid 's lair ,</l>
     <l n="711">And felt the merry breeze that blew ,</l>
     <l n="712">And watched the sharpies as they flew ,</l>
     <l n="713">And snuffed the sea 's breath thick with brine ,</l>
     <l n="714">And basked me in the sun 's warm shine ;</l>
     <l n="715">Then with my prize I made my way</l>
     <l n="716">Once more to where the sail-boat lay .</l>
     <l n="717">I kept the secret — and the glass ;</l>
     <l n="718">By day across its surface pass</l>
     <l n="719">The transient shapes of common things</l>
     <l n="720">Which chance within its oval brings .</l>
     <l n="721">But when at night I strive to sound</l>
     <l n="722">The darkness of its face profound ,</l>
     <l n="723">Again I seem to hear the breeze</l>
     <l n="724">That curls the waves on summer seas ;</l>
     <l n="725">I see the isles with cedars green ;</l>
     <l n="726">The channels winding in between ;</l>
     <l n="727">The coves with beaches of white sand ;</l>
     <l n="728">The reefs where warning spindles stand ;</l>
     <l n="729">And , through the multitudinous shimmer</l>
     <l n="730">Of waves and sun , again the glimmer</l>
     <l n="731">Of eyes unearthly falls on me ,</l>
     <l n="732">Deep with the mystery of the sea .</l>

    <head>THE RISING OF THE CURTAIN</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">We sit before the curtain , and we heed the pleasant bustle :</l>
     <l n="2">The ushers hastening up the aisles , the fans ’ and programmes ’ rustle ;</l>
     <l n="3">The boy that cries librettos , and the soft , incessant sound</l>
     <l n="4">Of talking and low laughter that buzzes all around .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">How very old the drop-scene looks ! A thousand times before</l>
     <l n="6">I 've seen that blue paint dashing on that red distemper shore ;</l>
     <l n="7">The castle and the guazzo sky , the very ilex-tree ,—</l>
     <l n="8">They have been there a thousand years ,— a thousand more shall be .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">All our lives we have been waiting for that weary daub to rise ;</l>
     <l n="10">We have peeped behind its edges , “ as if we were God 's spies ; ”</l>
     <l n="11">We have listened for the signal ; yet still , as in our youth ,</l>
     <l n="12">The colored screen of matter hangs between us and the truth .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">When in my careless childhood I dwelt beside a wood ,</l>

     <l n="15">And of the wild young forest paths that coaxed me to explore ,</l>
     <l n="16">Then dwindled down , or led me back to where I stood before .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">But through the woods before our door a wagon track went by ,</l>
     <l n="18">Above whose utmost western edge there hung an open sky ;</l>
     <l n="19">And there it seemed to make a plunge , or break off suddenly ,</l>
     <l n="20">As though beneath that open sky it met the open sea .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">Oh , often have I fancied , in the sunset 's dreamy glow ,</l>
     <l n="22">That mine eyes had caught the welter of the ocean waves below ;</l>
     <l n="23">And the wind among the pine-tops , with its low and ceaseless roar ,</l>

     <l n="29">And when , O King , the heaven departeth as a scroll ,</l>

     <l n="31">Shall I see thy feasting presence thronged with baron , knight , and page ?</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="33">For lo , quick undulations across the canvas run ;</l>
     <l n="34">The foot-lights brighten suddenly , the orchestra has done ;</l>
     <l n="35">And through the expectant silence rings loud the prompter 's bell ;</l>
     <l n="36">The curtain shakes ,— it rises . Farewell , dull world , farewell !</l>
