     <l n="1">“ Gabriel ! O my beloved ! ”</l>
     <l n="2">Then he beheld , in a dream , once more the home of his childhood ;</l>
     <l n="3">Green Acadian meadows , with sylvan rivers among them ,</l>
     <l n="4">Village , and mountain , and woodlands ; and , walking under their shadow ,</l>

     <l n="8">Vainly he strove to whisper her name , for the accents unuttered</l>
     <l n="9">Died on his lips , and their motion revealed what his tongue</l>
     <l n="10">would have spoken .</l>
     <l n="11">Vainly he strove to rise ; and Evangeline , kneeling beside him ,</l>
     <l n="12">Kissed his dying lips , and laid his head on her bosom .</l>
     <l n="13">Sweet was the light of his eyes ; but it suddenly sank into darkness ,</l>
     <l n="14">As when a lamp is blown out by a gust of wind at a casement .</l>
     <l n="15">All was ended now , the hope , and the fear , and the sorrow ,</l>
     <l n="16">All the aching of heart , the restless , unsatisfied longing .</l>
     <l n="17">All the dull , deep pain , and constant anguish of patience !</l>
     <l n="18">And , as she pressed once more the lifeless head to her bosom ,</l>
