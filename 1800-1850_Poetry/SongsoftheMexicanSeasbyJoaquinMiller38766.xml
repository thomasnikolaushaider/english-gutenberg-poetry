    <p>TO ABBIE . NOTE .— The lines in this little book , as in all my others , were written , or at least conceived , in the lands where the scenes are laid ; so that whatever may be said of the imperfections of my work , I at least have the correct atmosphere and color . I have now and then sent forth from Mexico , and from remoter shores of the Gulf , fragments of these thoughts as they rounded into form , and some of them have been used at a Dartmouth College Commencement , and elsewhere ; but as a whole the book is new . From the heart of the Sierra , where I once more hear the awful heart-throbs of Nature , I now intrust the first reception of these lessons entirely to my own country . And may I not ask in return , now at the last , when the shadows begin to grow long , something of that consideration which , thus far , has been accorded almost entirely by strangers ?</p>

    <head>THE SEA OF FIRE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In that far land , farther than Yucatan ,</l>
     <l n="2">Hondurian height , or Mahogany steep ,</l>
     <l n="3">Where the great sea , hollowed by the hand of man</l>
     <l n="4">Hears deep come calling across to deep ;</l>
     <l n="5">Where the great seas follow in the grooves of men</l>
     <l n="6">Down under the bastions of Darien :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">In that land so far that you wonder whether</l>
     <l n="8">If God would know it should you fall down dead ;</l>
     <l n="9">In that land so far through the wilds and weather</l>
     <l n="10">That the lost sun sinks like a warrior sped ,—</l>
     <l n="11">Where the sea and the sky seem closing together ,</l>
     <l n="12">Seem closing together as a book that is read :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">In that nude warm world , where the unnamed rivers</l>
     <l n="14">Roll restless in cradles of bright buried gold ;</l>
     <l n="15">Where white flashing mountains flow rivers of silver</l>
     <l n="16">As a rock of the desert flowed fountains of old ;</l>
     <l n="17">By a dark wooded river that calls to the dawn ,</l>
     <l n="18">And calls all day with his dolorous swan :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="19">In that land of the wonderful sun and weather ,</l>
     <l n="20">With green under foot and with gold over head ,</l>
     <l n="21">Where the spent sun flames , and you wonder whether</l>
     <l n="22">‘ Tis an isle of fire in his foamy bed :</l>
     <l n="23">Where the oceans of earth shall be welded together</l>
     <l n="24">By the great French master in his forge flame red ,—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="25">Lo ! the half-finished world ! Yon footfall retreating ,—</l>
     <l n="26">It might be the Maker disturbed at his task .</l>
     <l n="27">But the footfall of God , or the far pheasant beating ,</l>
     <l n="28">It is one and the same , whatever the mask</l>
     <l n="29">It may wear unto man . The woods keep repeating</l>
     <l n="30">The old sacred sermons , whatever you ask .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="31">The brown-muzzled cattle come stealthy to drink ,</l>
     <l n="32">The wild forest cattle , with high horns as trim</l>
     <l n="33">As the elk at their side : their sleek necks are slim</l>
     <l n="34">And alert like the deer . They come , then they shrink</l>
     <l n="35">As afraid of their fellows , of shadow-beasts seen</l>
     <l n="36">In the deeps of the dark-wooded waters of green .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="37">It is man in his garden , scarce wakened as yet</l>
     <l n="38">From the sleep that fell on him when woman was made .</l>
     <l n="39">The new-finished garden is plastic and wet</l>
     <l n="40">From the hand that has fashioned its unpeopled shade ;</l>
     <l n="41">And the wonder still looks from the fair woman 's eyes</l>
     <l n="42">As she shines through the wood like the light from the skies .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="43">And a ship now and then from some far Ophir 's shore</l>
     <l n="44">Draws in from the sea . It lies close to the bank ;</l>
     <l n="45">Then a dull , muffled sound of the slow-shuffled plank</l>
     <l n="46">As they load the black ship ; but you hear nothing more ,</l>
     <l n="47">And the dark dewy vines , and the tall sombre wood</l>
     <l n="48">Like twilight droop over the deep sweeping flood .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="49">The black masts are tangled with branches that cross ,</l>
     <l n="50">The rich , fragrant gums fall from branches to deck ,</l>
     <l n="51">The thin ropes are swinging with streamers of moss</l>
     <l n="52">That mantle all things like the shreds of a wreck ;</l>
     <l n="53">The long mosses swing , there is never a breath :</l>
     <l n="54">The river rolls still as the river of death .</l>

      <l n="58">Ere God had opened quite the door</l>
      <l n="59">Of this strange land for strong men 's feet ,—</l>
      <l n="60">There lay against that westmost sea</l>
      <l n="61">One weird-wild land of mystery .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="11">
      <l n="62">A far white wall , like fallen moon ,</l>
      <l n="63">Girt out the world . The forest lay</l>
      <l n="64">So deep you scarcely saw the day ,</l>
      <l n="65">Save in the high-held middle noon :</l>
      <l n="66">It lay a land of sleep and dreams ,</l>
      <l n="67">And clouds drew through like shoreless streams</l>
      <l n="68">That stretch to where no man may say .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="12">
      <l n="69">Men reached it only from the sea ,</l>
      <l n="70">By black-built ships , that seemed to creep</l>
      <l n="71">Along the shore suspiciously ,</l>
      <l n="72">Like unnamed monsters of the deep .</l>
      <l n="73">It was the weirdest land , I ween ,</l>
      <l n="74">That mortal eye has ever seen :</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="13">
      <l n="75">A dim , dark land of bird and beast ,</l>
      <l n="76">Black shaggy beasts with cloven claw ,—</l>
      <l n="77">A land that scarce knew prayer or priest ,</l>
      <l n="78">Or law of man , or Nature 's law ;</l>
      <l n="79">Where no fixed line drew sharp dispute</l>
      <l n="80">‘ Twixt savage man and silent brute .</l>

      <l n="98">On meek brown maidens of the land ,</l>
