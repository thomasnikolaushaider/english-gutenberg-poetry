    <head>HOPE AND FEAR</head>
     <l n="1">Beneath the shadow of dawn 's aerial cope ,</l>
     <l n="2">With eyes enkindled as the sun 's own sphere ,</l>
     <l n="3">Hope from the front of youth in godlike cheer</l>
     <l n="4">Looks Godward , past the shades where blind men grope</l>
     <l n="5">Round the dark door that prayers nor dreams can ope ,</l>
     <l n="6">And makes for joy the very darkness dear</l>
     <l n="7">That gives her wide wings play ; nor dreams that fear</l>
     <l n="8">At noon may rise and pierce the heart of hope .</l>
     <l n="9">Then , when the soul leaves off to dream and yearn ,</l>
     <l n="10">May truth first purge her eyesight to discern</l>
     <l n="11">What once being known leaves time no power to appal ;</l>
     <l n="12">Till youth at last , ere yet youth be not , learn</l>
     <l n="13">The kind wise word that falls from years that fall —</l>
     <l n="14">“ Hope thou not much , and fear thou not at all . ”</l>

      <l n="5">Takes life renewed , and all night 's godlike breast</l>
      <l n="6">Palpitates , gradually revealed at rest</l>
      <l n="7">By growth and change of ardours felt on high ,</l>
      <l n="8">Make onward , till the last flame fall and die</l>
      <l n="9">And all the world by night 's broad hand lie blest .</l>

      <l n="13">So from the graves whereon grief gazing saith</l>

      <l n="19">Down to the dark that knows not white from red ,</l>

      <l n="24">From far beyond the sunset , far above ,</l>
      <l n="25">Full toward the starry soundless east it blows</l>
      <l n="26">Bright as a child 's breath breathing on a rose ,</l>

     <l n="1">If that be yet a living soul which here</l>
     <l n="2">Seemed brighter for the growth of numbered springs</l>
     <l n="3">And clothed by Time and Pain with goodlier things</l>
     <l n="4">Each year it saw fulfilled a fresh fleet year ,</l>
     <l n="5">Death can have changed not aught that made it dear ;</l>
     <l n="6">Half humorous goodness , grave-eyed mirth on wings</l>
     <l n="7">Bright-balanced , blither-voiced than quiring strings ;</l>
     <l n="8">Most radiant patience , crowned with conquering cheer ;</l>
     <l n="9">A spirit inviolable that smiled and sang</l>
     <l n="10">By might of nature and heroic need</l>
     <l n="11">More sweet and strong than loftiest dream or deed ;</l>
     <l n="12">A song that shone , a light whence music rang</l>
     <l n="13">High as the sunniest heights of kindliest thought ;</l>
     <l n="14">All these must be , or all she was be nought .</l>

     <l n="3">With joy 's bright raiment and with love 's sweet bread ,</l>
     <l n="4">The whitest flock of earth 's maternal fold .</l>
     <l n="5">None there might wear about his brows enrolled</l>
     <l n="6">A light of lovelier fame than rings your head ,</l>
     <l n="7">Whose lovesome love of children and the dead</l>
     <l n="8">All men give thanks for : I far off behold</l>
     <l n="9">A dear dead hand that links us , and a light</l>
     <l n="10">The blithest and benignest of the night ,</l>
     <l n="11">The night of death 's sweet sleep , wherein may be</l>
     <l n="12">A star to show your spirit in present sight</l>

     <l n="9">Duty divine and Thought with eyes of fire</l>
