     <l n="2">WHERE is this patriarch you are kindly greeting ?</l>
     <l n="3">Not unfamiliar to my ear his name ,</l>
     <l n="4">Nor yet unknown to many a joyous meeting</l>
     <l n="5">In days long vanished ,— is he still the same ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">Or changed by years , forgotten and forgetting ,</l>
     <l n="7">Dull-eared , dim-sighted , slow of speech and thought ,</l>
     <l n="8">Still o'er the sad , degenerate present fretting ,</l>
     <l n="9">Where all goes wrong , and nothing as it ought ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">Old age , the graybeard ! Well , indeed , I know him ,—</l>
     <l n="11">Shrunk , tottering , bent , of aches and ills the prey ;</l>
     <l n="12">In sermon , story , fable , picture , poem ,</l>
     <l n="13">Oft have I met him from my earliest day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="14">In my old AEsop , toiling with his bundle ,—</l>
     <l n="15">His load of sticks ,— politely asking Death ,</l>
     <l n="16">Who comes when called for ,— would he lug or trundle</l>
     <l n="17">His fagot for him ?— he was scant of breath .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="18">And sad “ Ecclesiastes , or the Preacher , ” —</l>
     <l n="19">Has he not stamped the image on my soul ,</l>
     <l n="20">In that last chapter , where the worn-out Teacher</l>
     <l n="21">Sighs o'er the loosened cord , the broken bowl ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="22">Yes , long , indeed , I 've known him at a distance ,</l>
     <l n="23">And now my lifted door-latch shows him here ;</l>
     <l n="24">I take his shrivelled hand without resistance ,</l>
     <l n="25">And find him smiling as his step draws near .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="26">What though of gilded baubles he bereaves us ,</l>
     <l n="27">Dear to the heart of youth , to manhood 's prime ;</l>
     <l n="28">Think of the calm he brings , the wealth he leaves us ,</l>
     <l n="29">The hoarded spoils , the legacies of time !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="30">Altars once flaming , still with incense fragrant ,</l>
     <l n="31">Passion 's uneasy nurslings rocked asleep ,</l>
     <l n="32">Hope 's anchor faster , wild desire less vagrant ,</l>
     <l n="33">Life 's flow less noisy , but the stream how deep !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="34">Still as the silver cord gets worn and slender ,</l>
     <l n="35">Its lightened task-work tugs with lessening strain ,</l>
     <l n="36">Hands get more helpful , voices , grown more tender ,</l>
     <l n="37">Soothe with their softened tones the slumberous brain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="38">Youth longs and manhood strives , but age remembers ,</l>
     <l n="39">Sits by the raked-up ashes of the past ,</l>
     <l n="40">Spreads its thin hands above the whitening embers</l>
     <l n="41">That warm its creeping life-blood till the last .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="42">Dear to its heart is every loving token</l>
     <l n="43">That comes unbidden ere its pulse grows cold ,</l>
     <l n="44">Ere the last lingering ties of life are broken ,</l>
     <l n="45">Its labors ended and its story told .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="46">Ah , while around us rosy youth rejoices ,</l>
     <l n="47">For us the sorrow-laden breezes sigh ,</l>
     <l n="48">And through the chorus of its jocund voices</l>
     <l n="49">Throbs the sharp note of misery 's hopeless cry .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="50">As on the gauzy wings of fancy flying</l>
     <l n="51">From some far orb I track our watery sphere ,</l>
     <l n="52">Home of the struggling , suffering , doubting , dying ,</l>
     <l n="53">The silvered globule seems a glistening tear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="54">But Nature lends her mirror of illusion</l>
     <l n="55">To win from saddening scenes our age-dimmed eyes ,</l>
     <l n="56">And misty day-dreams blend in sweet confusion</l>
     <l n="57">The wintry landscape and the summer skies .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="58">So when the iron portal shuts behind us ,</l>
     <l n="59">And life forgets us in its noise and whirl ,</l>
     <l n="60">Visions that shunned the glaring noonday find us ,</l>
     <l n="61">And glimmering starlight shows the gates of pearl .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="62">I come not here your morning hour to sadden ,</l>
     <l n="63">A limping pilgrim , leaning on his staff ,—</l>
     <l n="64">I , who have never deemed it sin to gladden</l>
     <l n="65">This vale of sorrows with a wholesome laugh .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="66">If word of mine another 's gloom has brightened ,</l>
     <l n="67">Through my dumb lips the heaven-sent message came ;</l>
     <l n="68">If hand of mine another 's task has lightened ,</l>
     <l n="69">It felt the guidance that it dares not claim .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="70">But , O my gentle sisters , O my brothers ,</l>
     <l n="71">These thick-sown snow-flakes hint of toil 's release ;</l>
     <l n="72">These feebler pulses bid me leave to others</l>
     <l n="73">The tasks once welcome ; evening asks for peace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="74">Time claims his tribute ; silence now is golden ;</l>
     <l n="75">Let me not vex the too long suffering lyre ;</l>
     <l n="76">Though to your love untiring still beholden ,</l>
     <l n="77">The curfew tells me — cover up the fire .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="78">And now with grateful smile and accents cheerful ,</l>
     <l n="79">And warmer heart than look or word can tell ,</l>
     <l n="80">In simplest phrase — these traitorous eyes are tearful —</l>
     <l n="81">Thanks , Brothers , Sisters ,— Children ,— and farewell !</l>

     <l n="1">1829-1879</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Read at the Commencement Dinner of the Alumni of Harvard</l>
     <l n="3">University , June 25 , 1879 .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">WHILE fond , sad memories all around us throng ,</l>
     <l n="5">Silence were sweeter than the sweetest song ;</l>
     <l n="6">Yet when the leaves are green and heaven is blue ,</l>
     <l n="7">The choral tribute of the grove is due ,</l>
     <l n="8">And when the lengthening nights have chilled the skies ,</l>
     <l n="9">We fain would hear the song-bird ere be flies ,</l>
     <l n="10">And greet with kindly welcome , even as now ,</l>
     <l n="11">The lonely minstrel on his leafless bough .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="12">This is our golden year ,— its golden day ;</l>
     <l n="13">Its bridal memories soon must pass away ;</l>
     <l n="14">Soon shall its dying music cease to ring ,</l>
     <l n="15">And every year must loose some silver string ,</l>
     <l n="16">Till the last trembling chords no longer thrill ,—</l>
     <l n="17">Hands all at rest and hearts forever still .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="18">A few gray heads have joined the forming line ;</l>
     <l n="19">We hear our summons ,— “ Class of ‘ Twenty-Nine ! ”</l>
     <l n="20">Close on the foremost , and , alas , how few !</l>
     <l n="21">Are these “ The Boys ” our dear old Mother knew ?</l>
     <l n="22">Sixty brave swimmers . Twenty — something more —</l>
     <l n="23">Have passed the stream and reached this frosty shore !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="24">How near the banks these fifty years divide</l>
     <l n="25">When memory crosses with a single stride !</l>
     <l n="26">‘ T is the first year of stern “ Old Hickory ” ‘ s rule</l>
     <l n="27">When our good Mother lets us out of school ,</l>
     <l n="28">Half glad , half sorrowing , it must be confessed ,</l>
     <l n="29">To leave her quiet lap , her bounteous breast ,</l>
     <l n="30">Armed with our dainty , ribbon-tied degrees ,</l>
     <l n="31">Pleased and yet pensive , exiles and A . B . ' s .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="32">Look back , O comrades , with your faded eyes ,</l>
     <l n="33">And see the phantoms as I bid them rise .</l>
     <l n="34">Whose smile is that ? Its pattern Nature gave ,</l>
     <l n="35">A sunbeam dancing in a dimpled wave ;</l>
     <l n="36">KIRKLAND alone such grace from Heaven could win ,</l>
     <l n="37">His features radiant as the soul within ;</l>
     <l n="38">That smile would let him through Saint Peter 's gate</l>
     <l n="39">While sad-eyed martyrs had to stand and wait .</l>
     <l n="40">Here flits mercurial Farrar ; standing there ,</l>
     <l n="41">See mild , benignant , cautious , learned Ware ,</l>
     <l n="42">And sturdy , patient , faithful , honest Hedge ,</l>
     <l n="43">Whose grinding logic gave our wits their edge ;</l>
     <l n="44">Ticknor , with honeyed voice and courtly grace ;</l>
     <l n="45">And Willard , larynxed like a double bass ;</l>
     <l n="46">And Channing , with his bland , superior look ,</l>
     <l n="47">Cool as a moonbeam on a frozen brook ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="48">While the pale student , shivering in his shoes ,</l>
     <l n="49">Sees from his theme the turgid rhetoric ooze ;</l>
     <l n="50">And the born soldier , fate decreed to wreak</l>
     <l n="51">His martial manhood on a class in Greek ,</l>
     <l n="52">Popkin ! How that explosive name recalls</l>
     <l n="53">The grand old Busby of our ancient halls</l>
     <l n="54">Such faces looked from Skippon 's grim platoons ,</l>
     <l n="55">Such figures rode with Ireton 's stout dragoons :</l>
     <l n="56">He gave his strength to learning 's gentle charms ,</l>
     <l n="57">But every accent sounded “ Shoulder arms ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="58">Names ,— empty names ! Save only here and there</l>
     <l n="59">Some white-haired listener , dozing in his chair ,</l>
     <l n="60">Starts at the sound he often used to hear ,</l>
     <l n="61">And upward slants his Sunday-sermon ear .</l>
     <l n="62">And we — our blooming manhood we regain ;</l>
     <l n="63">Smiling we join the long Commencement train ,</l>
     <l n="64">One point first battled in discussion hot ,—</l>
     <l n="65">Shall we wear gowns ? and settled : We will not .</l>
     <l n="66">How strange the scene ,— that noisy boy-debate</l>
     <l n="67">Where embryo-speakers learn to rule the State !</l>
     <l n="68">This broad-browed youth , sedate and sober-eyed ,</l>
     <l n="69">Shall wear the ermined robe at Taney 's side ;</l>
     <l n="70">And he , the stripling , smooth of face and slight ,</l>
     <l n="71">Whose slender form scarce intercepts the light ,</l>
     <l n="72">Shall rule the Bench where Parsons gave the law ,</l>
     <l n="73">And sphinx-like sat uncouth , majestic Shaw</l>
     <l n="74">Ah , many a star has shed its fatal ray</l>
     <l n="75">On names we loved — our brothers — where are they ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="76">Nor these alone ; our hearts in silence claim</l>
     <l n="77">Names not less dear , unsyllabled by fame .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="78">How brief the space ! and yet it sweeps us back</l>
     <l n="79">Far , far along our new-born history 's track</l>
     <l n="80">Five strides like this ;— the sachem rules the land ;</l>
     <l n="81">The Indian wigwams cluster where we stand .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="82">The second . Lo ! a scene of deadly strife —</l>
     <l n="83">A nation struggling into infant life ;</l>
     <l n="84">Not yet the fatal game at Yorktown won</l>
     <l n="85">Where failing Empire fired its sunset gun .</l>
     <l n="86">LANGDON sits restless in the ancient chair ,—</l>
     <l n="87">Harvard 's grave Head ,— these echoes heard his prayer</l>
     <l n="88">When from yon mansion , dear to memory still ,</l>
     <l n="89">The banded yeomen marched for Bunker 's Hill .</l>
     <l n="90">Count on the grave triennial 's thick-starred roll</l>
     <l n="91">What names were numbered on the lengthening scroll ,—</l>
     <l n="92">Not unfamiliar in our ears they ring ,—</l>
     <l n="93">Winthrop , Hale , Eliot , Everett , Dexter , Tyng .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="94">Another stride . Once more at ‘ twenty-nine ,—</l>
     <l n="95">GOD SAVE KING GEORGE , the Second of his line !</l>
     <l n="96">And is Sir Isaac living ? Nay , not so ,—</l>
     <l n="97">He followed Flainsteed two short years ago ,—</l>
     <l n="98">And what about the little hump-backed man</l>
     <l n="99">Who pleased the bygone days of good Queen Anne ?</l>
     <l n="100">What , Pope ? another book he 's just put out ,—</l>
     <l n="101">“ The Dunciad , ” — witty , but profane , no doubt .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="102">Where 's Cotton Mather ? he was always here .</l>
     <l n="103">And so he would be , but he died last year .</l>
     <l n="104">Who is this preacher our Northampton claims ,</l>
     <l n="105">Whose rhetoric blazes with sulphureous flames</l>
     <l n="106">And torches stolen from Tartarean mines ?</l>
     <l n="107">Edwards , the salamander of divines .</l>
     <l n="108">A deep , strong nature , pure and undefiled ;</l>
     <l n="109">Faith , firm as his who stabbed his sleeping child ;</l>
     <l n="110">Alas for him who blindly strays apart ,</l>
     <l n="111">And seeking God has lost his human heart !</l>
     <l n="112">Fall where they might , no flying cinders caught</l>
     <l n="113">These sober halls where WADSWORTH ruled and</l>
     <l n="114">taught .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="115">One footstep more ; the fourth receding stride</l>
     <l n="116">Leaves the round century on the nearer side .</l>
     <l n="117">GOD SAVE KING CHARLES ! God knows that pleasant knave</l>
     <l n="118">His grace will find it hard enough to save .</l>
     <l n="119">Ten years and more , and now the Plague , the Fire ,</l>
     <l n="120">Talk of all tongues , at last begin to tire ;</l>
     <l n="121">One fear prevails , all other frights forgot ,—</l>
     <l n="122">White lips are whispering ,— hark ! The Popish Plot !</l>
     <l n="123">Happy New England , from such troubles free</l>
     <l n="124">In health and peace beyond the stormy sea !</l>
     <l n="125">No Romish daggers threat her children 's throats ,</l>
     <l n="126">No gibbering nightmare mutters “ Titus Oates ; ”</l>
     <l n="127">Philip is slain , the Quaker graves are green ,</l>
     <l n="128">Not yet the witch has entered on the scene ;</l>
     <l n="129">Happy our Harvard ; pleased her graduates four ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="131">Two centuries past , our hurried feet arrive</l>
     <l n="132">At the last footprint of the scanty five ;</l>
     <l n="133">Take the fifth stride ; our wandering eyes explore</l>
     <l n="134">A tangled forest on a trackless shore ;</l>
     <l n="135">Here , where we stand , the savage sorcerer howls ,</l>
     <l n="136">The wild cat snarls , the stealthy gray wolf prowls ,</l>
     <l n="137">The slouching bear , perchance the trampling moose</l>
     <l n="138">Starts the brown squaw and scares her red pappoose ;</l>

   <p>TO GEORGE PEABODY</p>
   <p>DANVERS , 1866</p>
   <p>BANKRUPT ! our pockets inside out ! Empty of words to speak his praises ! Worcester and Webster up the spout ! Dead broke of laudatory phrases ! Yet why with flowery speeches tease , With vain superlatives distress him ? Has language better words than these ? THE FRIEND OF ALL HIS RACE , GOD BLESS HIM !</p>
   <p>A simple prayer — but words more sweet By human lips were never uttered , Since Adam left the country seat Where angel wings around him fluttered . The old look on with tear-dimmed eyes , The children cluster to caress him , And every voice unbidden cries , THE FRIEND OF ALL HIS RACE , GOD BLESS HIM !</p>

     <l n="42">Dissolved in legend , crystallized in law ,</l>

     <l n="52">His holy life is Heaven 's unquestioned text ;</l>

     <l n="66">The lying fraction in its breast concealed ?</l>
