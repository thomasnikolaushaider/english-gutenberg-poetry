     <head>THE TENT ON THE BEACH</head>
     <p>It can scarcely be necessary to name as the two companions whom I reckoned with myself in this poetical picnic , Fields the lettered magnate , and Taylor the free cosmopolite . The long line of sandy beach which defines almost the whole of the New Hampshire sea-coast is especially marked near its southern extremity , by the salt-meadows of Hampton . The Hampton River winds through these meadows , and the reader may , if he choose , imagine my tent pitched near its mouth , where also was the scene of the Wreck of Rivermouth . The green bluff to the northward is Great Boar 's Head ; southward is the Merrimac , with Newburyport lifting its steeples above brown roofs and green trees on banks .</p>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">I would not sin , in this half-playful strain ,—</l>
       <l n="2">Too light perhaps for serious years , though born</l>
       <l n="3">Of the enforced leisure of slow pain ,—</l>
       <l n="4">Against the pure ideal which has drawn</l>
       <l n="5">My feet to follow its far-shining gleam .</l>
       <l n="6">A simple plot is mine : legends and runes</l>
       <l n="7">Of credulous days , old fancies that have lain</l>
       <l n="8">Silent , from boyhood taking voice again ,</l>
       <l n="9">Warmed into life once more , even as the tunes</l>
       <l n="10">That , frozen in the fabled hunting-horn ,</l>
       <l n="11">Thawed into sound :— a winter fireside dream</l>
       <l n="12">Of dawns and-sunsets by the summer sea ,</l>
       <l n="13">Whose sands are traversed by a silent throng</l>
       <l n="14">Of voyagers from that vaster mystery</l>
       <l n="15">Of which it is an emblem ;— and the dear</l>
       <l n="16">Memory of one who might have tuned my song</l>
       <l n="17">To sweeter music by her delicate ear .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="18">When heats as of a tropic clime</l>
       <l n="19">Burned all our inland valleys through ,</l>
       <l n="20">Three friends , the guests of summer time ,</l>
       <l n="21">Pitched their white tent where sea-winds blew .</l>
       <l n="22">Behind them , marshes , seamed and crossed</l>
       <l n="23">With narrow creeks , and flower-embossed ,</l>
       <l n="24">Stretched to the dark oak wood , whose leafy arms</l>
       <l n="25">Screened from the stormy East the pleasant inland farms .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="26">At full of tide their bolder shore</l>
       <l n="27">Of sun-bleached sand the waters beat ;</l>
       <l n="28">At ebb , a smooth and glistening floor</l>
       <l n="29">They touched with light , receding feet .</l>
       <l n="30">Northward a ‘ green bluff broke the chain</l>
       <l n="31">Of sand-hills ; southward stretched a plain</l>
       <l n="32">Of salt grass , with a river winding down ,</l>
       <l n="33">Sail-whitened , and beyond the steeples of the town ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="34">Whence sometimes , when the wind was light</l>
       <l n="35">And dull the thunder of the beach ,</l>
       <l n="36">They heard the bells of morn and night</l>
       <l n="37">Swing , miles away , their silver speech .</l>
       <l n="38">Above low scarp and turf-grown wall</l>
       <l n="39">They saw the fort-flag rise and fall ;</l>
       <l n="40">And , the first star to signal twilight 's hour ,</l>
       <l n="41">The lamp-fire glimmer down from the tall light-house tower .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="42">They rested there , escaped awhile</l>
       <l n="43">From cares that wear the life away ,</l>
       <l n="44">To eat the lotus of the Nile</l>
       <l n="45">And drink the poppies of Cathay ,—</l>
       <l n="46">To fling their loads of custom down ,</l>
       <l n="47">Like drift-weed , on the sand-slopes brown ,</l>
       <l n="48">And in the sea waves drown the restless pack</l>
       <l n="49">Of duties , claims , and needs that barked upon their track .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="50">One , with his beard scarce silvered , bore</l>
       <l n="51">A ready credence in his looks ,</l>
       <l n="52">A lettered magnate , lording o'er</l>
       <l n="53">An ever-widening realm of books .</l>
       <l n="54">In him brain-currents , near and far ,</l>
       <l n="55">Converged as in a Leyden jar ;</l>
       <l n="56">The old , dead authors thronged him round about ,</l>
       <l n="57">And Elzevir 's gray ghosts from leathern graves looked out .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="58">He knew each living pundit well ,</l>
       <l n="59">Could weigh the gifts of him or her ,</l>
       <l n="60">And well the market value tell</l>
       <l n="61">Of poet and philosopher .</l>
       <l n="62">But if he lost , the scenes behind ,</l>
       <l n="63">Somewhat of reverence vague and blind ,</l>
       <l n="64">Finding the actors human at the best ,</l>
       <l n="65">No readier lips than his the good he saw confessed .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="66">His boyhood fancies not outgrown ,</l>
       <l n="67">He loved himself the singer 's art ;</l>
       <l n="68">Tenderly , gently , by his own</l>
       <l n="69">He knew and judged an author 's heart .</l>
       <l n="70">No Rhadamanthine brow of doom</l>
       <l n="71">Bowed the dazed pedant from his room ;</l>
       <l n="72">And bards , whose name is legion , if denied ,</l>
       <l n="73">Bore off alike intact their verses and their pride .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="74">Pleasant it was to roam about</l>
       <l n="75">The lettered world as he had , done ,</l>
       <l n="76">And see the lords of song without</l>
       <l n="77">Their singing robes and garlands on .</l>
       <l n="78">With Wordsworth paddle Rydal mere ,</l>
       <l n="79">Taste rugged Elliott 's home-brewed beer ,</l>
       <l n="80">And with the ears of Rogers , at fourscore ,</l>
       <l n="81">Hear Garrick 's buskined tread and Walpole 's wit once more .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="82">And one there was , a dreamer born ,</l>
       <l n="83">Who , with a mission to fulfil ,</l>
       <l n="84">Had left the Muses ’ haunts to turn</l>
       <l n="85">The crank of an opinion-mill ,</l>
       <l n="86">Making his rustic reed of song</l>
       <l n="87">A weapon in the war with wrong ,</l>
       <l n="88">Yoking his fancy to the breaking-plough</l>
       <l n="89">That beam-deep turned the soil for truth to spring and grow .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="90">Too quiet seemed the man to ride</l>
       <l n="91">The winged Hippogriff Reform ;</l>
       <l n="92">Was his a voice from side to side</l>
       <l n="93">To pierce the tumult of the storm ?</l>
       <l n="94">A silent , shy , peace-loving man ,</l>
       <l n="95">He seemed no fiery partisan</l>
       <l n="96">To hold his way against the public frown ,</l>
       <l n="97">The ban of Church and State , the fierce mob 's hounding down .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="98">For while he wrought with strenuous will</l>
       <l n="99">The work his hands had found to do ,</l>
       <l n="100">He heard the fitful music still</l>
       <l n="101">Of winds that out of dream-land blew .</l>
       <l n="102">The din about him could not drown</l>
       <l n="103">What the strange voices whispered down ;</l>
       <l n="104">Along his task-field weird processions swept ,</l>
       <l n="105">The visionary pomp of stately phantoms stepped :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="106">The common air was thick with dreams ,—</l>
       <l n="107">He told them to the toiling crowd ;</l>
       <l n="108">Such music as the woods and streams</l>
       <l n="109">Sang in his ear he sang aloud ;</l>
       <l n="110">In still , shut bays , on windy capes ,</l>
       <l n="111">He heard the call of beckoning shapes ,</l>
       <l n="112">And , as the gray old shadows prompted him ,</l>
       <l n="113">To homely moulds of rhyme he shaped their legends grim .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="114">He rested now his weary hands ,</l>
       <l n="115">And lightly moralized and laughed ,</l>
       <l n="116">As , tracing on the shifting sands</l>
       <l n="117">A burlesque of his paper-craft ,</l>
       <l n="118">He saw the careless waves o'errun</l>
       <l n="119">His words , as time before had done ,</l>
       <l n="120">Each day 's tide-water washing clean away ,</l>
       <l n="121">Like letters from the sand , the work of yesterday .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="122">And one , whose Arab face was tanned</l>
       <l n="123">By tropic sun and boreal frost ,</l>

       <l n="125">Or people left him to exhaust ,</l>
       <l n="126">In idling mood had from him hurled</l>
       <l n="127">The poor squeezed orange of the world ,</l>
       <l n="128">And in the tent-shade , as beneath a palm ,</l>
       <l n="129">Smoked , cross-legged like a Turk , in Oriental calm .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="130">The very waves that washed the sand</l>

       <l n="133">And sultry Mauritanian shore .</l>
       <l n="134">From ice-rimmed isles , from summer seas</l>
       <l n="135">Palm-fringed , they bore him messages ;</l>
       <l n="136">He heard the plaintive Nubian songs again ,</l>
       <l n="137">And mule-bells tinkling down the mountain-paths of Spain .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="17">
       <l n="138">His memory round the ransacked earth</l>

       <l n="154">Sometimes along the wheel-deep sand</l>

      <head>The Goody Cole who figures in this poem and The Changeling as Eunice Cole , who for a quarter of a century or more was feared , persecuted , and hated as the witch of Hampton . She lived alone in a hovel a little distant from the spot where the Hampton Academy now stands , and there she died , unattended . When her death was discovered , she was hastily covered up in the earth near by , and a stake driven through her body , to exorcise the evil spirit . Rev . Stephen Bachiler or Batchelder was one of the ablest of the early New England preachers . His marriage late in life to a woman regarded by his church as disreputable induced him to return to England , where he enjoyed the esteem and favor of Oliver Cromwell during the Protectorate .</head>

      <head>THE PALATINE .</head>
      <head>Block Island in Long Island Sound , called by the Indians Manisees , the isle of the little god , was the scene of a tragic incident a hundred years or more ago , when The Palatine , an emigrant ship bound for Philadelphia , driven off its course , came upon the coast at this point . A mutiny on board , followed by an inhuman desertion on the part of the crew , had brought the unhappy passengers to the verge of starvation and madness . Tradition says that wreckers on shore , after rescuing all but one of the survivors , set fire to the vessel , which was driven out to sea before a gale which had sprung up . Every twelvemonth , according to the same tradition , the spectacle of a ship on fire is visible to the inhabitants of the island .</head>
