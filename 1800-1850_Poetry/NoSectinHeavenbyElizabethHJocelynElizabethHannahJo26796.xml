    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Talking of sects till late one eve ,</l>
     <l n="3">Of the various doctrines the saints believe ,</l>
     <l n="4">That night I stood in a troubled dream ,</l>
     <l n="5">By the side of a darkly flowing stream .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">And a “ Churchman ” down to the river came :</l>
     <l n="7">When I heard a strange voice call his name ,</l>
     <l n="8">“ Good father , stop ; when you cross this tide</l>
     <l n="9">You must leave your robes on the other side . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">But the aged father did not mind ,</l>
     <l n="11">And his long gown floated out behind ,</l>
     <l n="12">As down to the stream his way he took ,</l>
     <l n="13">His pale hands clasping a gilt-edged book .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="14">“ I 'm bound for heaven , and when I 'm there ,</l>
     <l n="15">I shall want my book of Common Prayer ;</l>
     <l n="16">And though I put on a starry crown ,</l>
     <l n="17">I should feel quite lost without my gown . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="18">Then he fixed his eye on the shining track ,</l>
     <l n="19">But his gown was heavy , and held him back ,</l>
     <l n="20">And the poor old father tried in vain</l>
     <l n="21">A single step in the flood to gain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="22">I saw him again on the other side ,</l>
     <l n="23">But his silk gown floated on the tide ;</l>
     <l n="24">And no one asked in that blissful spot ,</l>
     <l n="25">Whether he belonged to “ the Church ” or not .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="26">Then down to the river a Quaker strayed ,</l>
     <l n="27">His dress of a sober hue was made ;</l>
     <l n="28">“ My coat and hat must be all of gray ,</l>
     <l n="29">I cannot go any other way . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="30">Then he buttoned his coat straight up to his chin ,</l>
     <l n="31">And staidly , solemnly , waded in ,</l>
     <l n="32">And his broad-brimmed hat he pulled down tight</l>
     <l n="33">Over his forehead , so cold and white .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="34">But a strong wind carried away his hat ;</l>
     <l n="35">A moment he silently sighed over that ,</l>
     <l n="36">And then , as he gazed to the farther shore ,</l>
     <l n="37">The coat slipped off , and was seen no more .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="38">As he entered heaven , his suit of gray</l>
     <l n="39">Went quietly sailing — away — away ,</l>
     <l n="40">And none of the angels questioned him</l>
     <l n="41">About the width of his beaver 's brim .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="42">Next came Dr. Watts , with a bundle of Psalms</l>
     <l n="43">Tied nicely up in his aged arms ,</l>
     <l n="44">And hymns as many , a very wise thing ,</l>
     <l n="45">That the people in heaven , “ all round , ” might sing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="46">But I thought that he heaved an anxious sigh ,</l>
     <l n="47">As he saw that the river ran broad and high ,</l>
     <l n="48">And looked rather surprised as , one by one ,</l>
     <l n="49">The Psalms and Hymns in the wave went down .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="50">And after him , with his MSS .,</l>
     <l n="51">Came Wesley , the pattern of godliness ,</l>
     <l n="52">But he cried , “ Dear me , what shall I do ?</l>
     <l n="53">The water has soaked them through and through . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="54">And there on the river , far and wide ,</l>
     <l n="55">Away they went down the swollen tide ,</l>
     <l n="56">And the saint astonished , passed through alone ,</l>
     <l n="57">Without his manuscripts , up to the throne .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="58">Then , gravely walking , two saints by name ,</l>
     <l n="59">Down to the stream together came ,</l>
     <l n="60">But as they stopped at the river 's brink ,</l>
     <l n="61">I saw one saint from the other shrink .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="62">“ Sprinkled or plunged , may I ask you , friend ,</l>
     <l n="63">How you attained to life 's great end ? ”</l>
     <l n="64">“ Thus , with a few drops on my brow . ”</l>
     <l n="65">“ But I have been dipped , as you 'll see me now .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="66">“ And I really think it will hardly do ,</l>
     <l n="67">As I 'm ‘ close communion , ’ to cross with you ;</l>
     <l n="68">You 're bound , I know , to the realms of bliss ,</l>
     <l n="69">But you must go that way , and I 'll go this . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="70">Then straightway plunging with all his might ,</l>
     <l n="71">Away to the left — his friend at the right ,</l>
     <l n="72">Apart they went from this world of sin ,</l>
     <l n="73">But at last together they entered in .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="74">And now , when the river was rolling on ,</l>
     <l n="75">A Presbyterian church went down ;</l>
     <l n="76">Of women there seemed an innumerable throng ,</l>
     <l n="77">But the men I could count as they passed along .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="78">And concerning the road they could never agree ,</l>
     <l n="79">The old or the new way , which it could be ,</l>
     <l n="80">Nor ever a moment paused to think</l>
     <l n="81">That both would lead to the river 's brink .</l>
     <l n="82">And a sound of murmuring long and loud</l>
     <l n="83">Came ever up from the moving crowd ,</l>
     <l n="84">“ You 're in the old way , and I 'm in the new ,</l>
     <l n="85">That is the false , and this is the true , ” —</l>
     <l n="86">Or , “ I 'm in the old way , and you 're in the new ,</l>
     <l n="87">That is the false , and this is the true . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="88">But the brethren only seemed to speak ,</l>
     <l n="89">Modest the sisters walked , and meek ,</l>
     <l n="90">And if ever one of then chanced to say</l>
     <l n="91">What troubles she met with on the way ,</l>
     <l n="92">How she longed to pass to the other side ,</l>
     <l n="93">Nor feared to cross over the swelling tide ,</l>
     <l n="94">A voice arose from the brethren then :</l>
     <l n="95">“ Let no one speak but the ‘ holy men ; ’</l>
     <l n="96">For have ye not heard the words of Paul ,</l>
     <l n="97">‘ Oh , let the women keep silence all ? ’ ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="98">I watched them long in my curious dream ,</l>
     <l n="99">Till they stood by the borders of the stream ;</l>
     <l n="100">Then , just as I thought , the two ways met ,</l>
     <l n="101">But all the brethren were talking yet ,</l>
     <l n="102">And would talk on , till the heaving tide</l>
     <l n="103">Carried them over , side by side ;</l>
     <l n="104">Side by side , for the way was one ,</l>
     <l n="105">The toilsome journey of life was done ,</l>
     <l n="106">And priest and Quaker , and all who died ,</l>
     <l n="107">Came out alike on the other side .</l>
     <l n="108">No forms , or crosses , or books had they ,</l>
     <l n="109">No gowns of silk , or suits of gray ,</l>
     <l n="110">No creeds to guide them , or MSS .,</l>
     <l n="111">For all had put on Christ 's righteousness .</l>
