  <p>CHARLES BAUDELAIRE .</p>
  <p>BY JAMES HUNEKER .</p>
   <p>I</p>
   <p>For the sentimental no greater foe exists than the iconoclast who dissipates literary legends . And he is abroad nowadays . Those golden times when they gossiped of De Quincey 's enormous opium consumption , of the gin absorbed by gentle Charles Lamb , of Coleridge 's dark ways , Byron 's escapades , and Shelley 's atheism — alas ! into what faded limbo have they vanished . Poe , too , whom we saw in fancy reeling from Richmond to Baltimore , Baltimore to Philadelphia , Philadelphia to New York . Those familiar fascinating anecdotes have gone the way of all such jerry-built spooks . We now know Poe to have been a man suffering at the time of his death from cerebral lesion , a man who drank at intervals and little . Dr. Guerrier of Paris has exploded a darling superstition about De Quincey 's opium-eating . He has demonstrated that no man could have lived so long — De Quincey was nearly seventy-five at his death — and worked so hard , if he had consumed twelve thousand drops of laudanum as often as he said he did . Furthermore , the English essayist 's description of the drug 's effects is inexact . He was seldom sleepy — a sure sign , asserts Dr. Guerrier , that he was not altogether enslaved by the drug habit . Sprightly in old age , his powers of labour were prolonged until past three-score and ten . His imagination needed little opium to produce the famous Confessions . Even Gautier 's revolutionary red waistcoat worn at the premiere of Hernani was , according to Gautier , a pink doublet . And Rousseau has been whitewashed . So they are disappearing , those literary legends , until , disheartened , we cry out : Spare us our dear , old-fashioned , disreputable men of genius !</p>
   <p>But the legend of Charles Baudelaire is seemingly indestructible . This French poet has suffered more from the friendly malignant biographer and chroniclers than did Poe . Who shall keep the curs out of the cemetery ? asked Baudelaire after he had read Griswold on Poe . A few years later his own cemetery was invaded and the world was put into possession of the Baudelaire legend ; that legend of the atrabilious , irritable poet , dandy , maniac , his hair dyed green , spouting blasphemies ; that grim , despairing image of a diabolic , a libertine , saint , and drunkard . Maxime du Camp was much to blame for the promulgation of these tales — witness his Souvenirs litteraires . However , it may be confessed that part of the Baudelaire legend was created by Charles Baudelaire . In the history of literature it is difficult to parallel such a deliberate piece of self-stultification . Not Villon , who preceded him , not Verlaine , who imitated him , drew for the astonishment or disedification of the world a like unflattering portrait . Mystifier as he was , he must have suffered at times from acute cortical irritation . And , notwithstanding his desperate effort to realize Poe 's idea , he only proved Poe correct , who had said that no man can bare his heart quite naked ; there always will be something held back , something false ostentatiously thrust forward . The grimace , the attitude , the pomp of rhetoric are so many buffers between the soul of man and the sharp reality of published confessions . Baudelaire was no more exception to this rule than St. Augustine , Bunyan , Rousseau , or Huysmans ; though he was as frank as any of them , as we may see in the printed diary , Mon coeur mis a nu ( Posthumous Works , Societe du Mercure de France ) ; and in the Journal , Fusees , Letters , and other fragments exhumed by devoted Baudelarians .</p>
   <p>To smash legends , Eugene Crepet 's biographical study , first printed in 1887 , has been republished with new notes by his son , Jacques Crepet . This is an exceedingly valuable contribution to Baudelaire lore ; a dispassionate life , however , has yet to be written , a noble task for some young poet who will disentangle the conflicting lies originated by Baudelaire — that tragic comedian — from the truth and thus save him from himself . The Crepet volume is really but a series of notes ; there are some letters addressed to the poet by the distinguished men of his day , supplementing the rather disappointing volume of Letters , 1841-1866 , published in 1908 . There are also documents in the legal prosecution of Baudelaire , with memories of him by Charles Asselineau , Leon Cladel , Camille Lemonnier , and others .</p>
   <p>In November , 1850 , Maxime du Camp and Gustave Flaubert found themselves at the French Ambassador 's , Constantinople . The two friends had taken a trip in the Orient which later bore fruit in Salammbo . General Aupick , the representative of the French Government , cordially the young men received ; they were presented to his wife , Madame Aupick . She was the mother of Charles Baudelaire , and inquired rather anxiously of Du Camp : “ My son has talent , has he not ? ” Unhappy because her second marriage , a brilliant one , had set her son against her , the poor woman welcomed from such a source confirmation of her eccentric boy 's gifts . Du Camp tells the much-discussed story of a quarrel between the youthful Charles and his stepfather , a quarrel that began at table . There were guests present . After some words Charles bounded at the General 's throat and sought to strangle him . He was promptly boxed on the ears and succumbed to a nervous spasm . A delightful anecdote , one that fills with joy psychiatrists in search of a theory of genius and degeneration . Charles was given some money and put on board a ship sailing to East India . He became a cattle-dealer in the British army , and returned to France years afterward with a Venus noire , to whom he addressed extravagant poems ! All this according to Du Camp . Here is another tale , a comical one . Baudelaire visited Du Camp in Paris , and his hair was violently green . Du Camp said nothing . Angered by this indifference , Baudelaire asked : “ You find nothing abnormal about me ? ” “ No , ” was the answer . “ But my hair — it is green ! ” “ That is not singular , mon cher Baudelaire ; every one has hair more or less green in Paris . ” Disappointed in not creating a sensation , Baudelaire went to a cafe , gulped down two large bottles of Burgundy , and asked the waiter to remove the water , as water was a disagreeable sight ; then he went away in a rage . It is a pity to doubt this green hair legend ; presently a man of genius will not be able to enjoy an epileptic fit in peace — as does a banker or a beggar . We are told that St. Paul , Mahomet , Handel , Napoleon , Flaubert , Dostoievsky were epileptoids ; yet we do not encounter men of this rare kind among the inmates of asylums . Even Baudelaire had his sane moments .</p>
   <p>The joke of the green hair has been disposed of by Crepet . Baudelaire 's hair thinning after an illness , he had his head shaved and painted with salve of a green hue , hoping thereby to escape baldness . At the time when he had embarked for Calcutta ( May , 1841 ) , he was not seventeen , but twenty years of age . Du Camp said he was seventeen when he attacked General Aupick . The dinner could not have taken place at Lyons because the Aupick family had left that city six years before the date given by Du Camp . Charles was provided with five thousand francs for his expenses , instead of twenty — Du Camp 's version — and he never was a beef-drover in the British army , for a good reason — he never reached India . Instead , he disembarked at the Isle of Bourbon , and after a short stay suffered from homesickness and returned to France , after being absent about ten months . But , like Flaubert , on his return home Baudelaire was seized with the nostalgia of the East ; over there he had yearned for Paris . Jules Claretie recalls Baudelaire saying to him with a grimace : “ I love Wagner ; but the music I prefer is that of a cat hung up by his tail outside of a window , and trying to stick to the panes of glass with its claws . There is an odd grating on the glass which I find at the same time strange , irritating , and singularly harmonious . ” Is it necessary to add that Baudelaire , notorious in Paris for his love of cats , dedicating poems to cats , would never have perpetrated such revolting cruelty ?</p>
   <p>Another misconception , a critical one , is the case of Poe and Baudelaire . The young Frenchman first became infatuated with Poe 's writings in 1846 or 1847 — he gave these two dates , though several stories of Poe had been translated into French as early as 1841 or 1842 ; L'OranghYpppHeNOutang was the first , which we know as The Murders in the Rue Morgue ; Madame Meunier also adapted several Poe stories for the reviews . Baudelaire 's labours as a translator lasted over ten years . That he assimilated Poe , that he idolized Poe , is a commonplace of literary gossip . But that Poe had overwhelming influence in the formation of his poetic genius is not the truth . Yet we find such an acute critic as the late Edmund Clarence Stedman writing , “ Poe 's chief influence upon Baudelaire 's own production relates to poetry . ” It is precisely the reverse . Poe 's influence affected Baudelaire 's prose , notably in the disjointed confessions , Mon coeur mis a nu , which vaguely recall the American writer 's Marginalia . The bulk in the poetry in Les Fleurs du Mal was written before Baudelaire had read Poe , though not published in book form until 1857 . But in 1855 some of the poems saw the light in the Revue des deux Mondes , while many of them had been put forth a decade or fifteen years before as fugitive verse in various magazines . Stedman was not the first to make this mistake . In Bayard Taylor 's The Echo Club we find on page 24 this criticism : “ There was a congenital twist about Poe ... Baudelaire and Swinburne after him have been trying to surpass him by increasing the dose ; but his muse is the natural Pythia inheriting her convulsions , while they eat all sorts of insane roots to produce theirs . ” This must have been written about 1872 , and after reading it one would fancy that Poe and Baudelaire were rhapsodic wrigglers on the poetic tripod , whereas their poetry is often reserved , even glacial . Baudelaire , like Poe , sometimes “ built his nests with the birds of Night , ” and that was enough to condemn the work of both men by critics of the didactic school .</p>
   <p>Once , when Baudelaire heard that an American man of letters (? ) was in Paris , he secured an introduction and called on him . Eagerly inquiring after Poe , he learned that he was not considered a genteel person in America , Baudelaire withdrew , muttering maledictions . Enthusiastic poet ! Charming literary person ! Yet the American , whoever he was , represented public opinion at the time . To-day criticisms of Poe are vitiated by the desire to make him an angel . It is to be doubted whether without his barren environment and hard fortunes we should have had Poe at all . He had to dig down deep into the pit of his personality to reach the central core of his music . But every ardent young soul entering “ literature ” begins by a vindication of Poe 's character . Poe was a man , and he is now a classic . He was a half-charlatan as was Baudelaire . In both the sublime and the sickly were never far asunder . The pair loved to mystify , to play pranks on their contemporaries . Both were implacable pessimists . Both were educated in affluence , and both had to face unprepared the hardships of life . The hastiest comparison of their poetic work will show that their only common ideal was the worship of an exotic beauty . Their artistic methods of expression were totally dissimilar . Baudelaire , like Poe , had a harp-like temperament which vibrated in the presence of strange subjects . Above all , he was obsessed by sex . Women , as angel of destruction , is the keynote of his poems . Poe was almost sexless . His aerial creatures never footed the dusty highways of the world . His lovely lines , “ Helen , thy beauty is to me , ” could never have been written by Baudelaire ; while Poe would never have pardoned the “ fulgurant ” grandeur , the Beethoven-like harmonies , the Dantesque horrors of that “ deep wide music of lost souls ” in “ Femmes Damnees ":</p>
   <p>“ Descendes , descendes , lamentable victimes . ”</p>
   <p>Or this , which might serve as a text for one of John Martin 's vast sinister mezzotints :</p>

   <p>George Saintsbury thus sums up the differences between Poe and Baudelaire : “ Both authors — Poe and De Quincey — fell short of Baudelaire himself as regards depth and fulness of passion , but both have a superficial likeness to him in eccentricity of temperameut and affection for a certain peculiar mixture of grotesque and horror . ” Poe is without passion , except a passion for the macabre ; what Huysmans calls “ The October of the sensations ” ; whereas , there is a gulf of despair and terror and humanity in Baudelaire , which shakes your nerves , yet stimulates the imagination . However , profounder as a poet , he was no match for Poe in what might be termed intellectual prestidigitation . The mathematical Poe , the Poe of the ingenious detective tales , tales extraordinary , the Poe of the swift flights into the cosmic blue , the Poe the prophet and mystic — in these the American was more versatile than his French translator . That Baudelaire said , “ Evil be thou my good , ” is doubtless true . He proved all things and found them vanity . He is the poet of original sin , a worshipper of Satan for the sake of paradox ; his Litanies to Satan ring childish to us — in his heart he was a believer . His was “ an infinite reverse aspiration , ” and mixed up with his pose was a disgust for vice , for life itself . He was the last of the Romanticists ; Sainte-Beuve called him the Kamchatka of Romanticism ; its remotest hyperborean peak . Romanticism is dead to-day , as dead as Naturalism ; but Baudelaire is alive , and read . His glistening phosphorescent trail is over French poetry and he is the begetter of a school :— Verlaine , Villiers de l'Isle Adam , Carducci , Arthur Rimbaud , Jules Laforgue , Gabriel D'Annunzio , Aubrey Beardsley , Verhaeren , and many of the youthful crew . He affected Swinburne , and in Huysmans , who was not a poet , his splenetic spirit lives . Baudelaire 's motto might be the obverse of Browning 's lines : “ The Devil is in heaven . All 's wrong with the world . ”</p>
   <p>When Goethe said of Hugo and the Romanticists that they came from Chateaubriand , he should have substituted the name of Rousseau — “ Romanticism , it is Rousseau , ” exclaims Pierre Lasserre . But there is more of Byron and Petrus Borel — a forgotten half-mad poet — in Baudelaire ; though , for a brief period , in 1848 , he became a Rousseau reactionary , sported the workingman 's blouse , cut his hair , shouldered a musket , went to the barricades , wrote inflammatory editorials calling the proletarian “ Brother ! ” ( oh , Baudelaire ! ) and , as the Goncourts recorded in their diary , had the head of a maniac . How seriously we may take this swing of the pendulum is to be noted in a speech of the poet 's at the time of the Revolution : “ Come , ” he said , “ let us go shoot General Aupick ! ” It was his stepfather that he thought of , not the eternal principles of Liberty . This may be a false anecdote ; many such were foisted upon Baudelaire . For example , his exclamations at cafes or in public places , such as : “ Have you ever eaten a baby ? I find it pleasing to the palate ! ” or , “ The night I killed my father ! ” Naturally , people stared and Baudelaire was happy — he had startled a bourgeois . The cannibalistic idea he may have borrowed from Swift 's amusing pamphlet , for this French poet knew English literature .</p>
   <p>Gautier compares the poems to a certain tale of Hawthorne 's in which there is a garden of poisoned flowers . But Hawthorne worked in his laboratory of evil wearing mask and gloves ; he never descended into the mud and sin of the street . Baudelaire ruined his health , smudged his soul , yet remained withal , as Anatole France says , “ a divine poet . ” How childish , yet how touching is his resolution — he wrote in his diary of prayer 's dynamic force — when he was penniless , in debt , threatened with imprisonment , sick , nauseated with sin : “ To make every morning my prayer to God , the reservoir of all force , and all justice ; to my father , to Mariette , and to Poe as intercessors . ” ( Evidently , Maurice Barres encountered here his theory of Intercessors . ) Baudelaire loved the memory of his father as much as Stendhal hated his own . He became reconciled with his mother after the death of General Aupick , in 1857 . He felt in 1862 that his own intellectual eclipse was approaching , for he wrote : “ I have cultivated my hysteria with joy and terror . To-day imbecility 's wing fanned me as it passed . ” The sense of the vertiginous gulf was abiding with him ; read his poem , “ Pascal avait son gouffre . ”</p>
   <p>In preferring the Baudelaire translations of Poe to the original — and they give the impression of being original works — Stedman agreed with Asselineau that the French is more concise than the English . The prose of Poe and Baudelaire is clear , sober , rhythmic ; Baudelaire 's is more lapidary , finer in contour , richer coloured , more supple , though without the “ honey and tiger 's blood ” of Barbey d'Aurevilly . Baudelaire 's soul was patiently built up as a fabulous bird might build its nest — bits of straw , the sobbing of women , clay , cascades of black stars , rags , leaves , rotten wood , corroding dreams , a spray of roses , a sparkle of pebble , a gleam of blue sky , arabesques of incense and verdigris , despairing hearts and music and the abomination of desolation , for its ground-tones . But this soul-nest is also a cemetery of the seven sorrows . He loves the clouds ... les nuages ... la bas .... It was la bas with him even in the tortures of his wretched love-life . Corruption and death were ever floating in his consciousness . He was like Flaubert , who saw everywhere the hidden skeleton . Felicien Hops has best interpreted Baudelaire ; the etcher and poet were closely knit spirits . Rodin , too , is a Baudelarian . If there could be such an anomaly as a native wood-note wildly evil , it would be the lyric and astringent voice of this poet . His sensibility was both catholic and morbid , though he could be frigid in the face of the most disconcerting misfortunes . He was a man for whom the invisible word existed ; if Gautier was pagan , Baudelaire was a strayed spirit from mediaeval days . The spirit rules , and , as Paul Bourget said , “ he saw God . ” A Manichean in his worship of evil , he nevertheless abased his soul : “ Oh ! Lord God ! Give me the force and courage to contemplate my heart and my body without disgust , ” he prays : but as some one remarked to Rochefoucauld , “ Where you end , Christianity begins . ”</p>
   <p>Baudelaire built his ivory tower on the borders of a poetic Maremma , which every miasma of the spirit pervaded , every marsh-light and glow-worm inhabited . Like Wagner , Baudelaire painted in his sultry music the profundities of abysms , the vastness of space . He painted , too , the great nocturnal silences of the soul .</p>
   <p>Pacem summum tenent ! He never reached peace on the heights . Let us admit that souls of his kind are encased in sick frames ; their steel is too shrewd for the scabbard ; yet the enigma for us is none the less unfathomable . Existence for such natures is a sort of muffled delirium . To affiliate him with Poe , De Quincey , Hoffman , James Thomson , Coleridge , and the rest of the sombre choir does not explain him ; he is , perhaps , nearer Donne and Villon than any of the others — strains of the metaphysical and sinister and supersubtle are to be discovered in him . The disharmony of brain and body , the spiritual bilocation , are only too easy to diagnose ; but the remedy ? Hypocrite lecteur — mon semblable — mon frere ! When the subtlety , force , grandeur , of his poetic production be considered , together with its disquieting , nervous , vibrating qualities , it is not surprising that Victor Hugo wrote to the poet : “ You invest the heaven of art with we know not what deadly rays ; you create a new shudder . ” Hugo might have said that he turned Art into an Inferno . Baudelaire is the evil archangel of poetry . In his heaven of fire , glass and ebony he is the blazing Lucifer . “ A glorious devil , large in heart and brain , that did love beauty only ... ” once sang Tennyson , though not of the Frenchman .</p>
   <p>II</p>
   <p>As long ago as 1869 , and in our “ barbarous gas-lit country , ” as Baudelaire named the land of Poe , an unsigned review appeared in which this poet was described as “ unique and as interesting as Hamlet . He is that rare and unknown being , a genuine poet — a poet in the midst of things that have disordered his spirit — a poet excessively developed in his taste for and by beauty ... very responsive to the ideal , very greedy of sensation . ” A better description of Baudelaire does not exist The Hamlet-motive , particularly , is one that sounded throughout the disordered symphony of the poet 's life .</p>
   <p>He was , later , revealed — also reviled — to American readers by Henry James , who completely missed his significance . This was in 1878 , when appeared the first edition of French Poets and Novelists . Previous to that there had been some desultory discussion , a few essays in the magazines , and in 1875 a sympathetic paper by Professor James Albert Harrison of the University of Virginia . He denounced the Frenchman for his reprehensible taste , though he did not mention his beautiful verse nor his originality in the matter of criticism . Baudelaire , in his eyes , was not only immoral , but he had , with the approbation of Sainte-Beuve , introduced Poe as a great man to the French nation . ( See Baudelaire 's letter to Sainte-Beuve in the newly published Letters , 1841-1866 . ) Perhaps “ Mr. Dick Minim ” and his projected Academy of Criticism might make clear these devious problems .</p>
   <p>The Etudes Critiques of Edmond Scherer were collected in 1863 . In them we find this unhappy , uncritical judgment : “ Baudelaire , lui , n'a rien , ni le coeur , ni l'esprit , ni l'idee , ni le mot , ni la raison , ni la fantaisie , ni la verve , ni meme la facture ... son unique titre c'est d'avoir contribue a creer l'esthetique de la debauche . ” It is not our intention to dilate upon the injustice of this criticism . It is Baudelaire the critic of aesthetics in whom we are interested . Yet I cannot forbear saying that if all the negations of Scherer had been transformed into affirmations , only justice would have been accorded Baudelaire , who was not alone a poet , the most original of his century , but also a critic of the first rank , one who welcomed Richard Wagner when Paris hooted him and his fellow composer , Hector Berlioz , played the role of the envious ; one who fought for Edouard Manet , Leconte de Lisle , Gustave Flaubert , Eugene Delacroix ; fought with pen for the modern etchers , illustrators , Meryon , Daumier , Felicien Rops , Gavarni , and Constantin Guys . He literally identified himself with De Quincey and Poe , translating them so wonderfully well that some unpatriotic persons like the French better than the originals . So much was Baudelaire absorbed in Poe that a writer of his times asserted that the translator would meet the same fate as the American poet . A singular , vigorous spirit is Baudelaire 's , whose poetry with its “ icy ecstasy ” is profound and harmonious , whose criticism is penetrated by a catholic quality , who anticipated modern critics in his abhorrence of schools and environments , preferring to isolate the man and uniquely study him . He would have subscribed to Swinburne 's generous pronouncement : “ I have never been able to see what should attract man to the profession of criticism but the noble pleasure of praising . ” The Frenchman has said that it would be impossible for a critic to become a poet ; and it is impossible for a poet not to contain a critic .</p>
   <p>Theophile Gautier 's study prefixed to the definitive edition of Les Fleurs du Mal is not only the most sympathetic exposition of Baudelaire as man and genius , but it is also the high-water mark of Gautier 's gifts as a critical essayist . We learn therein how the young Charles , an incorrigible dandy , came to visit Hotel Pimodan about 1844 . In this Hotel Pimodan a dilettante , Ferdinand Boissard , held high revel . His fantastically decorated apartments were frequented by the painters , poets , sculptors , romancers , of the day — that is , carefully selected ones such as Liszt , George Sand , Merimee , and others whose verve or genius gave them the privilege of saying Open Sesame ! to this cave of forty Supermen . Balzac has in his Peau de Chagrin pictured the same sort of scenes which were supposed to occur weekly at the Pimodan . Gautier eloquently describes the meeting of these kindred artistic souls , where the beautiful Jewess , Maryx , who had posed for Ary Scheffer 's Mignon and for Paul Delaroche 's La Gloire , met the superb Madame Sabatier , the only woman that Baudelaire loved , and the original of that extraordinary group of Clesinger 's — the sculptor and son-in-law of George Sand — la Femme au Serpent , a Salammbo a la mode in marble . Hasheesh was eaten , so Gautier writes , by Boissard and Baudelaire . As for the creator of Mademoiselle Maupin , he was too robust for such nonsense . He had to work for his living at journalism , and he died in harness , an irreproachable father , while the unhappy Baudelaire , the inheritor of an intense , unstable temperament , soon devoured his patrimony of 75 , 000 francs , and for the remaining years of his life was between the devil of his dusky Jenny Duval and the deep sea of hopeless debt .</p>
   <p>It was at these Pimodan gatherings , which were no doubt much less wicked than the participants would have us believe , that Baudelaire encountered Emile Deroy , a painter of skill , who made his portrait , and encouraged the fashionable young fellow to continue his art studies . We have seen an album containing sketches by the poet . They betray talent of about the same order as Thackeray 's , with a superadded note of the “ horrific ” — that favourite epithet of the early Poe critics . Baudelaire admired Thackeray , and when the Englishman praised the illustrations of Guys , he was delighted . Deroy taught his pupil the commonplaces of a painter 's technique ; also how to compose a palette — a rather meaningless phrase nowadays . At least , he did not write of the arts without some technical experience . Delacroix took up his enthusiastic disciple , and when the Salons of Baudelaire appeared in 1845 , 1846 , 1855 , and 1859 , the praise and blame they evoked were testimonies to the training and knowledge of their author . A new spirit had been born .</p>
   <p>The names of Diderot and Baudelaire were coupled . Neither academic nor spouting the jargon of the usual critic , the Salons of Baudelaire are the production of a humanist . Some would put them above Diderot 's . Mr. Saintsbury , after Swinburne the warmest advocate of Baudelaire among the English , thinks that the French poet in his picture criticism observed too little and imagined too much . “ In other words , ” he adds , “ to read a criticism of Baudelaire 's without the title affixed is by no means a sure method of recognizing the picture afterward . ” Now , word-painting was the very thing that Baudelaire avoided . It was his friend Gautier , with the plastic style , who attempted the well-nigh impossible feat of competing in his verbal descriptions with the certitudes of canvas and marble . And , if he with his verbal imagination did not entirely succeed , how could a less adept manipulator of the vocabulary ? We do not agree with Mr. Saintsbury . No one can imagine too much when the imagination is that of a poet . Baudelaire divined the work of the artist and set it down scrupulously in a prose of exceeding rectitude . He did not paint pictures in prose . He did not divagate . He did not overburden his pages with technical terms . But the spirit of his subject he did disengage in a few swift phrases . The polemics of historical schools were a cross for him to bear , and he wore his prejudices lightly . Like a true critic , he judged more by form than theme . There are no types ; there is only life , he asserted , and long before Jules Laforgue . He was ever art-for-art , yet , having breadth of comprehension and a Heine-like capacity for seeing both sides of his own nature with its idiosyncrasies , he could write : “ The puerile utopia of the school of art-for-art , in excluding morality , and often even passion , was necessarily sterile . All literature which refuses to advance fraternally between science and philosophy is a homicidal and a suicidal literature . ”</p>
   <p>Baudelaire , then , was no less sound a critic of the plastic arts than of music and literature . Like his friend Flaubert , he had a horror of democracy , of the democratisation of the arts , of all the sentimental fuss and fuddle of a pseudo-humanitarianism . During the 1848 agitation the former dandy of 1840 put on a blouse and spoke of barricades . Those things were in the air . Wagner rang the alarm-bells during the Dresden uprising . Chopin wrote for the pianoforte a revolutionary etude . Brave lads ! Poets and musicians fight their battles best in the region of the ideal . Baudelaire 's little attack of the equality-measles soon vanished . He lectured his brother poets and artists on the folly and injustice of abusing or despising the bourgeois ( being a man of paradox , he dedicated a volume of his Salons to the bourgeois ) , but he would not have contradicted Mr. George Moore for declaring that “ in art the democrat is always reactionary . In 1830 the democrats were against Victor Hugo and Delacrois . ” And Les Fleurs du Mal , that book of opals , blood , and evil swamp-flowers , will never be savoured by the mob .</p>
   <p>In his Souvenirs de Jeunesse , Champfleury speaks of the promenades in the Louvre he enjoyed the company with Baudelaire . Bronzino was one of the poet 's preferences . He was also attracted by El Greco — not an unnatural admiration , considering the sombre extravagance of his own genius . Of Goya he has written in exalted phrases . Velasquez was his touchstone . Being of a perverse nature , his Derves ruined by abuse of drink and drugs , the landscapes of his imagination were more beautiful than Nature herself . The country itself , he declared , was odious . Like Whistler , whom he often met — see the Hommage a Delacrois by Fantin-Latour , with its portraits of Whistler , Baudelaire , Manet , Bracquemond the etcher , Legros , Delacrois , Cordier , Duranty the critic , and De Balleroy — he could not help showing his aversion to “ foolish sunsets . ” In a word , Baudelaire , into whose brain had entered too much moonlight , was the father of a lunar school of poetry , criticism and fiction . His Samuel Cramer , in La Fanfarlo , is the literary progenitor of Jean , Duc d'Esseintes , in Huysmans 's A Rebours . Huysmans at first modelled himself upon Baudelaire . His Le Drageoir aux Epices is a continuation of Petits Poemes en Prose . And to Baudelaire 's account must be laid much artificial morbid writing . Despite his pursuit of perfection in form , his influence has been too often baneful to impressionable artists in embryo . A lover of Gallic Byronism , and high-priest of the Satanic school , there was no extravagance , absurd or terrible , that he did not commit , from etching a four-part fugue on ice to skating hymns in honour of Lucifer . In his criticism alone was he the sane logical Frenchman . And while he did not live to see the success of the Impressionist group , he surely would have acclaimed their theory and practice . Was he not an impressionist himself ?</p>
   <p>As Richard Wagner was his god in music , so Delacroix quite overflowed his aesthetic consciousness . Read Volume II of his collected works , Curiosites Esthetiques , which contains his Salons ; also his essay , De l'Essence du Rire ( worthy to be placed side by side with George Meredith 's essay on Comedy ) . Caricaturists , French and foreign , are considered in two chapters at the close of the volume . Baudelaire was as conscientious as Gautier . He trotted around miles of mediocre canvas , saying an encouraging word to the less talented , boiling over with holy indignation or indulging in glacial irony , before the rash usurpers occupying the seats of the mighty , and pouncing on new genius with promptitude . Upon Delacroix he lavished the largesse of his admiration . He smiled at the platitudes of Horace Vernet , and only shook his head over the Schnetzes and other artisans of the day . He welcomed William Hausollier , now so little known . He praised Deveria , Chasseriau — who waited years before he came into his own ; his preferred landscapists were Corot , Rousseau and Troyon . He impolitely spoke of Ary Scheffer and the “ apes of sentiment ” ; while his discussions of Hogarth , Cruikshank , Pinelli and Breughel proclaims his versatility of vision . In his essay Le Peintre de la Vie Moderne he was the first among critics to recognize the peculiar quality called “ modernity , ” that naked vibration which informs the novels of Goncourt , Flaubert 's L'Education Sentimentale , and the pictures of Manet , Monet , Degas and Raffaelli with their evocations of a new , nervous Paris . It is in his Volume III , entitled L'Art Romantique , that so many things dear to the new century were then subjects of furious quarrels . This book contains much just and brilliant writing . It was easy for Nietzsche to praise Wagner in Germany in 1876 , but dangerous at Paris in 1861 to declare war on Wagner 's adverse critics . This Baudelaire did .</p>
   <p>The relations of Baudelaire and Edouard Manet were exceedingly cordial . In a letter to Theophile Thore , the art critic ( Letters , p. 361 ) , we find Baudelaire defending his friend from the accusation that his pictures were pastiches of Goya . He wrote : “ Manet has never seen Goya , never El Greco ; he was never in the Pourtales Gallery . ” Which may have been true at the time , 1864 , nevertheless Manet had visited Madrid and spent much time studying Velasquez and abusing Spanish cookery . ( Consider , too , Goya 's Balcony with Girls and Manet 's famous Balcony . ) Raging at the charge of imitation , Baudelaire said in this same epistle : “ They accuse even me of imitating Edgar Poe .... Do you know why I so patiently translated Poe ? Because he resembled me . ” The poet italicized these words . With stupefaction , therefore , he admired the mysterious coincidences of Manet 's work with that of Goya and El Greco .</p>
   <p>He took Manet seriously . He wrote to him in a paternal and severe tone . Recall his reproof when urging the painter to exhibit his work . “ You complain about attacks , but are you the first to endure them ? Have you more genius than Chateaubriand and Wagner ? They were not killed by derision . And in order not to make you too proud I must tell you that they are models , each in his way , and in a very rich world , while you are only the first in the decrepitude of your art . ” ( Letters , p . 436 . )</p>
   <p>Would Baudelaire recall these prophetic words if he were able to revisit the glimpses of the Champs Elysees at the Autumn Salons ? What would he think of Cezanne ? Odilon Redon he would understand , for he is the transposer of Baudelairianism to terms of design and colour . And perhaps the poet whose verse is saturated with tropical hues — he , when young , sailed in southern seas — might appreciate the monstrous debauch of form and colour in the Tahitian canvases of Paul Gauguin .</p>
   <p>Baudelaire 's preoccupation with pictorial themes may be noted in his verse . He is par excellence the poet of aesthetics . To Daumier he inscribed a poem ; and to the sculptor Ernest Christophe , to Delacroix ( Sur Tasse en Prison ) , to Manet , to Guys ( Reve Parisien ) , to an unknown master ( Une Martyre ) ; and Watteau , a Watteau a rebours , is seen in Un Voyage a Cythere ; while in Les Phares this poet of the ideal , spleen music , and perfume , shows his adoration for Rubens , Leonardo da Vinci , Michelangelo , Rembrandt , Puget , Goya , Delacroix — “ Delacroix , lac de sang hante des mauvais anges . ” And what is more exquisite than his quatrain to Lola de Valence , a poetic inscription for the picture of Edouard Manet , with its last line as vaporous , as subtle as Verlaine : “ Le charme inattendu d'un bijou rose et noir ! ” Heine called himself the last of the Romantics . The first of the “ Moderns ” and the last of the Romantics was the many-sided Charles Baudelaire .</p>
   <p>III</p>
   <p>He was born at Paris , April 9 , 1821 ( Flaubert 's birth year ) , and not April 21 , as Gautier has it . His father was Joseph Francis Baudelaire , or Baudelaire , who occupied a government position . A cultivated art lover , his taste was apparent in the home he made for his second wife , Caroline Archimbaut-Dufays , an orphan and the daughter of a military officer . There was a considerable difference in the years of this pair ; the mother was twenty-seven , the father sixty-two , at the birth of their only child . By his first marriage the elder Baudelaire had one son , Claude , who , like his half-brother Charles , died of paralysis , though a steady man of business . That great modern neurosis , called Commerce , has its mental wrecks , too , and no one pays attention ; but when a poet falls by the wayside is the chase begun by neurologists and other soul-hunters seeking victims . After the death of Baudelaire 's father , the widow , within a year , married the handsome , ambitious Aupick , then chef de bataillon , lieutenant-colonel , decorated with the Legion of Honour , and later general and ambassador to Madrid , Constantinople , and London . Charles was a nervous , frail youth , but unlike most children of genius , he was a scholar and won brilliant honours at school . His stepfather was proud of him . From the Royal College of Lyons , Charles went to the Lycee Louis-le-Grand , Paris , but was expelled in 1839 , on various discreditable charges . Troubles soon began at home . He was irascible , vain , precocious , and given to dissipation . He quarreled with General Aupick , and disdained his mother . But she was to blame , she has confessed ; she had quite forgotten the boy in the flush of her second love . He could not forget , or forgive what he called her infidelity to the memory of his father . Hamlet-like , he was inconsolable . The good Bishop of Montpellier , who knew the family , said that Charles was a little crazy — second marriages usually bring woe in their train . “ When a mother has such a son , she does n't re-marry , ” said the young poet Charles signed himself Baudelaire-Dufays , or sometimes Dufais . He wrote in his journal : “ My ancestors , idiots or maniacs ... all victims of terrible passions ” ; which was one of his exaggerations . His grandfather on the paternal side was a Champenois peasant , his mother 's family presumably Norman , but not much is known of her forbears . Charles believed himself lost from the time his half-brother was stricken . He also believed that his instability of temperament — and he studied his “ case ” as would a surgeon — was the result of his parents ’ disparity in years .</p>
   <p>After his return from the East , where he did not learn English as has been said — his mother taught him as a boy to converse in and write the language — he came into his little inheritance , about fifteen thousand dollars . Two years later he was so heavily in debt that his family asked for a guardian on the ground of incompetency . He had been swindled , being young and green . How had he squandered his money ? Not exactly on opera-glasses , like Gerard de Nerval , but on clothes , pictures , furniture , books . The remnant was set aside to pay his debts . Charles would be both poet and dandy . He dressed expensively but soberly , in the English fashion ; his linen dazzling , the prevailing hue of his habiliments black . In height he was medium , his eyes brown , searching , luminous , the eye of a nyctalops , “ eyes like ravens ” ; nostrils palpitating , cleft chin , mouth expressive , sensual jaw , strong and square . His hair was black , curly , glossy , his forehead high , square and white . In the Deroy portrait he wears a beard ; he is there what Catulle Mendes nicknamed him : “ His Excellence , Monseigneur Brummel ! ” Later he was the elegiac Satan , the author of L'Imitation de N. S . le Diable ; or the Baudelaire of George Moore : “ the clean-shaven face of the mock priest , the slow cold eyes and the sharp cunning sneer of the cynical libertine who will be tempted that he may better know the worthlessness of temptation . ” In the heyday of his blood he was perverse and deliberate . Let us credit him with contradicting the Byronic notion that ennui could best be cured by dissipation ; in sin Baudelaire found the saddest of all consolations . Mendes laughs at the legend of Baudelaire 's violence , of his being given to explosive phrases . Despite Gautier 's stories about the Hotel Pimodan and its club of hasheesh-eaters , M. Mendes denies that Baudelaire was a victim of the hemp . What the majority of mankind does not know concerning the habits of literary workers is this prime fact : men who work hard , writing verse — and there is no mental toil comparable to it — cannot drink , or indulge in opium , without inevitable collapse . The old-fashioned ideas of “ inspiration , ” spontaneity , easy improvisation , the sudden bolt from heaven , are delusions still hugged by the world . To be told that Chopin filed at his music for years , that Beethoven in his smithy forged his thunderbolts by the sweat of his brow , that Manet toiled like a labourer on the dock , that Baudelaire was a mechanic in his devotion to poetic work , that Gautier was a hard-working journalist , are disillusions for the sentimental . Minerva springing full-fledged from Jupiter 's skull to the desk of the poet is a pretty fancy ; but Balsac and Flaubert did not encourage this fancy . Work literally killed Poe , as it killed Jules de Goncourt , Flaubert and Daudet . Maupassant went insane because he would work and he would play the same day . Baudelaire worked and worried . His debts haunted him his life long . His constitution was flawed — Sainte-Beuve told him that he had worn out his nerves — from the start , he was detraque ; but that his entire life was one huge debauch is a nightmare of the moral police in some red cotton nightcap country .</p>
   <p>His period of mental production was not brief nor barren . He was a student . Du Camp 's charge that he was an ignorant man is disproved by the variety and quality of his published work . His range of sympathies was large . His mistake , in the eyes of his colleagues , was to write so well about the seven arts . Versatility is seldom given its real name — which is protracted labour . Baudelaire was one of the elect , an aristocrat , who dealt with the quintessence of art ; his delicate air of a bishop , his exquisite manners , his modulated voice , aroused unusual interest and admiration . He was a humanist of distinction ; he has left a hymn to Saint Francis in the Latin of the decadence . Baudelaire , like Chopin , made more poignant the phrase , raised to a higher intensity the expressiveness of art .</p>
   <p>Women played a commanding role in his life . They always do with any poet worthy of the name , though few have been so frank in acknowledging this as Baudelaire . Yet he was in love more with Woman than the individual . The legend of the beautiful creature he brought from the East resolves itself into the dismal affair with Jeanne Duval . He met her in Paris , after he had been in the East . She sang at a cafe concert in Paris . She was more brown than black . She was not handsome , not intelligent , not good ; yet he idealized her , for she was the source of half his inspiration . To her were addressed those marvellous evocations of the Orient , of perfume , tresses , delicious dawns on strange far-away seas and “ superb Byzant , ” domes that devils built . Baudelaire is the poet of perfumes ; he is also the patron saint of ennui . No one has so chanted the praise of odours . His soul swims on perfume as do other souls on music , he has sung . As he grew older he seemed to hunt for more acrid odours ; he often presents an elaborately chased vase the carving of which transports us , but from which the head is quickly averted . Jeanne , whom he never loved , no matter what may be said , was a sorceress . But she was impossible ; she robbed , betrayed him ; he left her a dozen times only to return . He was a capital draughtsman with a strong nervous line and made many pen-and-ink drawings of her . They are not prepossessing . In her rapid decline she was not allowed to want . Madame Aupick paid her expenses in the hospital . A sordid history . She was a veritable flower of evil for Baudelaire . Yet poetry , like music , would be colourless , scentless , if it sounded no dissonances . Fancy art reduced to the beatific and banal chord of C major !</p>
   <p>He fell in love with the celebrated Madame Sabatier , a reigning beauty , at whose salon artistic Paris assembled . She had been christened by Gautier Madame la Presidente , and her sumptuous beauty was portrayed by Ricard in his La Femme au Chien . She returned Baudelaire 's love . They soon parted . Again a riddle which the published letters hardly solve . One letter , however , does show that Baudelaire had tried to be faithful , and failed . He could not extort from his exhausted soul the sentiment ; but he put its music on paper . His most seductive lyrics were addressed to Madame Sabatier : “ A la tres chere , a la tres-belle , ” a hymn saturated with love . Music , spleen , perfumes — “ colour , sound , perfumes call to each other as deep to deep ; perfumes like the flesh of children , soft as hautboys , green as the meadows ” — criminals , outcasts , the charm of childhood , the horrors of love , pride , and rebellion , Eastern landscapes , cats , soothing and false ; cats , the true companions of lonely poets ; haunted clocks , shivering dusks , and gloomier dawns — Paris in a hundred phases — these and many other themes this strange-souled poet , this “ Dante , pacer of the shore , ” of Paris has celebrated in finely wrought verse and profound phrases . In a single line he contrives atmosphere ; the very shape of his sentence , the ring of the syllables , arouse the deepest emotion . A master of harmonic undertones is Baudelaire . His successors have excelled him in making their music more fluid , more lyrical , more vapourous — many young French poets pass through their Baudelarian green-sickness — but he alone knows the secrets of moulding those metallic , free sonnets , which have the resistance of bronze ; and of the despairing music that flames from the mouths of lost souls trembling on the wharves of hell . He is the supreme master of irony and troubled voluptuousness .</p>
   <p>Baudelaire is a masculine poet . He carved rather than sang ; the plastic arts spoke to his soul . A lover and maker of images . Like Poe , his emotions transformed themselves into ideas . Bourget classified him as mystic , libertine , and analyst . He was born with a wound in his soul , to use the phrase of Pere Lacordaire . ( Curiously enough , he actually contemplated , in 1861 , becoming a candidate for Lacordaire 's vacant seat in the French Academy . Sainte-Beuve dissuaded him from this folly . ) Recall Baudelaire 's prayer : “ Thou , O Lord , my God , grant me the grace to produce some fine lines which will prove to myself that I am not the last of men , that I am not inferior to those I contemn . ” Individualist , egoist , anarchist , his only thought was letters . Jules Laforgue thus described Baudelaire : “ Cat , Hindoo , Yankee , Episcopal , Alchemist . ” Yes , an alchemist who suffocated in the fumes he created . He was of Gothic imagination , and could have said with Rolla : “ Je suis venu trop tard dans un monde trop vieux . ” He had an unassuaged thirst for the absolute . The human soul was his stage , he its interpreting orchestra .</p>
   <p>In 1857 The Flowers of Evil was published by Poulet-Malassis , who afterward went into bankruptcy — a warning to publishers with a taste for fine literature . The titles contemplated were Limbes , or Lesbiennes . Hippolyte Babou suggested the one we know . These poems were suppressed on account of six , and poet and publisher summoned . As the municipal government had made a particular ass of itself in the prosecution of Gustave Flaubert and his Madame Bovary , the Baudelaire matter was disposed of in haste . He was condemned to a fine of three hundred francs , a fine which was never paid , as the objectionable poems were removed . They were printed in the Belgian edition , and may be read in the new volume , OEuvres . Posthumes .</p>
   <p>Baudelaire was infuriated over the judgment , for he knew that his book was dramatic in expression . He had expected , like Flaubert , to emerge from the trial with flying colours ; therefore to be classed as one who wrote objectionable literature was a shock . “ Flaubert had the Empress back of him , ” he complained ; which was true ; the Empress Eugenie , also the Princess Mathilde . But he worked as ever and put forth those polished intaglios called Poems in Prose , for the form of which he had taken a hint from Aloys Bertrand 's Gaspard de la Nuit . He filled this form with a new content ; not alone pictures , but moods , are to be found in those miniatures . Pity is their keynote , a tenderness for the abject and lowly , a revelation of sensibility that surprised those critics who had discerned in Baudelaire only a sculptor of evil . In one of his poems he described a landscape of metal , of marble and water ; a babel of staircases and arcades , a palace of infinity , surrounded by the silence of eternity . This depressing yet magical dream was utilized by Huysmans in his A Rebours . But in the tiny landscapes of the Prose Poems there is nothing rigid or artificial . Indeed , the poet 's deliberate attitude of artificiality is dropped . He is human . Not that the deep fundamental note of humanity is ever absent in his poems ; the eternal diapason is there even when least overheard . Baudelaire is more human than Poe . His range of sympathy is wider . In this he transcends him as a poet , though his subject-matter often issues from the very dregs of life . Brother to pitiable wanderers , there are , nevertheless , no traces of cant , no “ Russian pity ” a la Dostoievsky , no humanitarian or socialistic rhapsodies in his work . Baudelaire is an egoist He hated the sentimental sapping of altruism . His prose-poem , Crowds , with its “ bath of multitude , ” may have been suggested by Poe ; but in Charles Lamb we find the idea : “ Are there no solitudes out of caves and the desert ? or cannot the heart , in the midst of crowds , feel frightfully alone ? ”</p>
   <p>His best critical work is the Richard Wagner and Tannhauser , as significant an essay as Nietzsche 's Richard Wagner in Bayreuth . And Baudelaire 's polemic appeared at a more critical period in Wagner 's career . Wagner sent a brief hearty letter of thanks to the critic , and later made his acquaintance . To Wagner , Baudelaire introduced a young Wagnerian , Villiers de l'Isle Adam . This Wagner letter is included in the volume of Crepet ; but there are no letters published from Baudelaire to Franz Liszt , though they were friends . In Weimar I saw at the Liszt Museum several from Baudelaire which should have been included in the Letters . The poet understood Liszt and his reforms as he understood Wagner . The German composer admired the French poet , and his Kundry , in the sultry second act of Parsifal , has a Baudelairian hue , especially in the temptation scene .</p>
   <p>The end was at hand . Baudelaire had been steadily , rather , unsteadily , going downhill ; a desperate figure , a dandy in shabby attire . He went out only after dark , he haunted the exterior boulevards , associated with birds of nocturnal plumage . He drank without thirst , ate without hunger , as he has said . A woeful decadence for this aristocrat of life and letters . Most sorrowful of sinners , a morose delectation scourged his nerves and extorted the darkest music from his lyre . He fled to Brussels , there to rehabilitate his dwindling fortunes . He gave a few lectures , and met Rops , Lemonnier , drank to forget , and forgot to work . He abused Brussels , Belgium , its people . A country , he cried , where the trees are black , the flowers without odour , and where there is no conversation ! He , the brilliant causeur , the chief blaguer of a circle in which young James McNeill Whistler was reduced to the role of a listener — this most spiritual among artists , found himself a failure in the Belgian capital . It may not be amiss to remind ourselves that Baudelaire was the creator of many of the paradoxes attributed , not only to Whistler , but to an entire school — if one may employ such a phrase . The frozen imperturbability of the poet , his cutting enunciation , his power of blasphemy , his hatred of Nature , his love of the artificial , have been copied by the aesthetic blades of our day . He it was who first taunted Nature with being an imitator of art , with always being the same . Oh , the imitative sunsets ! Oh , the quotidian eating and drinking ! And as pessimist , too , he led the mode . Baudelaire , like Flaubert , grasped the murky torch of pessimism once held by Chateaubriand , Benjamin Constant , and Senancour . Doubtless , all this stemmed from Byronism . And now it is as stale as Byronism .</p>
   <p>His health failed , and he lacked money enough to pay for doctor 's prescriptions ; he even owed for the room in his hotel . At Namur , where he was visiting the father-in-law of Felician Rops ( March , 1866 ) , he suffered from an attack of paralysis . He was removed to Brussels . His mother , who lived at Honneur , in mourning for her husband , came to his aid . Taken to France , he was placed in a sanatorium . Aphasia set in . He could only ejaculate a mild oath , and when he caught sight of himself in the mirror he would bow pleasantly as if to a stranger . His friends rallied , and they were among the most distinguished people in Paris , the elite of souls . Ladies visited him , one or two playing Wagner on the piano — which must have added a fresh nuance to death — and they brought him flowers . He expressed his love for flowers and music to the last . He could not bear the sight of his mother ; she revived in him some painful memories , but that passed , and he clamoured for her when she was absent . If anyone mentioned the names of Wagner or Manet , he smiled . And with a fixed stare , as if peering through some invisible window opening upon eternity , he died , August 31 , 1867 , aged forty-six .</p>
   <p>Barbey d'Aurevilly himself a Satanist and dandy ( oh , those comical old attitudes of literature ) , had prophesied that the author of Fleurs du Mal would either blow out his brains or prostrate himself at the foot of the cross . ( Later he said the same of Huysmans . ) Baudelaire had the alternative course forced upon him by fate after he had attempted spiritual suicide for how many years ? ( He once tried actual suicide , but the slight cut in his throat looked so ugly to him that he went no farther . ) His soul had been a battle-field for the powers of good and evil . That at the end he brought the wreck of both soul and body to his God should not be a subject for comment . He was an extraordinary poet with a bad conscience , who lived miserably and was buried with honours . Then it was that his worth was discovered ( funeral orations over a genius are a species of public staircase-wit ) . His reputation waxes with the years . He is an exotic gem in the crown of French poetry . Of him Swinburne has chanted Ave Atque Vale :</p>

    <head>EVERY MAN HIS CHIMAERA .</head>
    <head>Beneath a broad grey sky , upon a vast and dusty plain devoid of grass , and where not even a nettle or a thistle was to be seen , I met several men who walked bowed down to the ground .</head>
     <l n="1">Each one carried upon his back an enormous Chimaera as heavy as a sack of</l>
     <l n="2">flour or coal , or as the equipment of a Roman foot-soldier .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But the monstrous beast was not a dead weight , rather she enveloped and oppressed the men with her powerful and elastic muscles , and clawed with her two vast talons at the breast of her mount . Her fabulous head reposed upon the brow of the man like one of those horrible casques by which ancient warriors hoped to add to the terrors of the enemy .</p>
   <p>I questioned one of the men , asking him why they went so . He replied that he knew nothing , neither he nor the others , but that evidently they went somewhere , since they were urged on by an unconquerable desire to walk .</p>
   <p>Very curiously , none of the wayfarers seemed to be irritated by the ferocious beast hanging at his neck and cleaving to his back : one had said that he considered it as a part of himself . These grave and weary faces bore witness to no despair . Beneath the splenetic cupola of the heavens , their feet trudging through the dust of an earth as desolate as the sky , they journeyed onwards with the resigned faces of men condemned to hope for ever . So the train passed me and faded into the atmosphere of the horizon at the place where the planet unveils herself to the curiosity of the human eye .</p>
   <p>During several moments I obstinately endeavoured to comprehend this mystery ; but irresistible Indifference soon threw herself upon me , nor was I more heavily dejected thereby than they by their crushing Chimaeras .</p>

    <head>VENUS AND THE FOOL .</head>
     <l n="1">How admirable the day ! The vast park swoons beneath the burning eye of</l>
     <l n="2">the sun , as youth beneath the lordship of love .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>There is no rumour of the universal ecstasy of all things . The waters themselves are as though drifting into sleep . Very different from the festivals of humanity , here is a silent revel .</p>
   <p>It seems as though an ever-waning light makes all objects glimmer more and more , as though the excited flowers burn with a desire to rival the blue of the sky by the vividness of their colours ; as though the heat , making perfumes visible , drives them in vapour towards their star .</p>
   <p>Yet , in the midst of this universal joy , I have perceived one afflicted thing .</p>
   <p>At the feet of a colossal Venus , one of those motley fools , those willing clowns whose business it is to bring laughter upon kings when weariness or remorse possesses them , lies wrapped in his gaudy and ridiculous garments , coined with his cap and bells , huddled against the pedestal , and raises towards the goddess his eyes filled with tears .</p>
   <p>And his eyes say : “ I am the last and most alone of all mortals , inferior to the meanest of animals in that I am denied either love or friendship . Yet I am made , even I , for the understanding and enjoyment of immortal Beauty . O Goddess , have pity upon my sadness and my frenzy . ”</p>
   <p>The implacable Venus gazed into I know not what distances with her marble eyes .</p>
   <p>INTOXICATION .</p>
   <p>One must be for ever drunken : that is the sole question of importance . If you would not feel the horrible burden of Time that bruises your shoulders and bends you to the earth , you must be drunken without cease . But how ? With wine , with poetry , with virtue , with what you please . But be drunken . And if sometimes , on the steps of a palace , on the green grass by a moat , or in the dull loneliness of your chamber , you should waken up , your intoxication already lessened or gone , ask of the wind , of the wave , of the star , of the bird , of the timepiece ; ask of all that flees , all that sighs , all that revolves , all that sings , all that speaks , ask of these the hour ; and wind and wave and star and bird and timepiece will answer you : “ It is the hour to be drunken ! Lest you be the martyred slaves of Time , intoxicate yourselves , be drunken without cease ! With wine , with poetry , with virtue , or with what you will . ”</p>

    <head>THE GIFTS OF THE MOON .</head>
     <l n="1">The Moon , who is caprice itself , looked in at the window as you slept in</l>
     <l n="2">your cradle , and said to herself : “ I am well pleased with this child . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And she softly descended her stairway of clouds and passed through the window-pane without noise . She bent over you with the supple tenderness of a mother and laid her colours upon your face . Therefrom your eyes have remained green and your cheeks extraordinarily pale . From contemplation of your visitor your eyes are so strangely wide ; and she so tenderly wounded you upon the breast that you have ever kept a certain readiness to tears .</p>
   <p>In the amplitude of her joy , the Moon filled all your chamber as with a phosphorescent air , a luminous poison ; and all this living radiance thought and said : “ You shall be for ever under the influence of my kiss . You shall love all that loves me and that I love : clouds , and silence , and night ; the vast green sea ; the unformed and multitudinous waters ; the place where you are not ; the lover you will never know ; monstrous flowers , and perfumes that bring madness ; cats that stretch themselves swooning upon the piano and lament with the sweet , hoarse voices of women .</p>
   <p>“ And you shall be loved of my lovers , courted of my courtesans . You shall be the Queen of men with green eyes , whose breasts also I have wounded in my nocturnal caress : men that love the sea , the immense green ungovernable sea ; the unformed and multitudinous waters ; the place where they are not ; the woman they will never know ; sinister flowers that seem to bear the incense of some unknown religion ; perfumes that trouble the will ; and all savage and voluptuous animals , images of their own folly . ”</p>
   <p>And that is why I am couched at your feet , O spoiled child , beloved and accursed , seeking in all your being the reflection of that august divinity , that prophetic godmother , that poisonous nurse of all lunatics .</p>
   <p>THE INVITATION TO THE VOYAGE .</p>
   <p>It is a superb land , a country of Cockaigne , as they say , that I dream of visiting with an old friend . A strange land , drowned in our northern fogs , that one might call the East of the West , the China of Europe ; a land patiently and luxuriously decorated with the wise , delicate vegetations of a warm and capricious phantasy .</p>
   <p>A true land of Cockaigne , where all is beautiful , rich , tranquil , and honest ; where luxury is pleased to mirror itself in order ; where life is opulent , and sweet to breathe ; from whence disorder , turbulence , and the unforeseen are excluded ; where happiness is married to silence ; where even the food is poetic , rich and exciting at the same time ; where all things , my beloved , are like you .</p>
   <p>Do you know that feverish malady that seizes hold of us in our cold miseries ; that nostalgia of a land unknown ; that anguish of curiosity ? It is a land which resembles you , where all is beautiful , rich , tranquil and honest , where phantasy has built and decorated an occidental China , where life is sweet to breathe , and happiness married to silence . It is there that one would live ; there that one would die .</p>
   <p>Yes , it is there that one must go to breathe , to dream , and to lengthen one 's hours by an infinity of sensations . A musician has written the “ Invitation to the Waltz ” ; where is he who will write the “ Invitation to the Voyage , ” that one may offer it to his beloved , to the sister of his election ?</p>
   <p>Yes , it is in this atmosphere that it would be good to live ,— yonder , where slower hours contain more thoughts , where the clocks strike the hours of happiness with a more profound and significant solemnity .</p>
   <p>Upon the shining panels , or upon skins gilded with a sombre opulence , beatified paintings have a discreet life , as calm and profound as the souls of the artists who created them .</p>
   <p>The setting suns that colour the rooms and salons with so rich a light , shine through veils of rich tapestry , or through high leaden-worked windows of many compartments . The furniture is massive , curious , and bizarre , armed with locks and secrets , like profound and refined souls . The mirrors , the metals , the ail ver work and the china , play a mute and mysterious symphony for the eyes ; and from all things , from the corners , from the chinks in the drawers , from the folds of drapery , a singular perfume escapes , a Sumatran revenez-y , which is like the soul of the apartment .</p>
   <p>A true country of Cockaigne , I have said ; where all is rich , correct and shining , like a beautiful conscience , or a splendid set of silver , or a medley of jewels . The treasures of the world flow there , as in the house of a laborious man who has well merited the entire world . A singular land , as superior to others as Art is superior to Nature ; where Nature is made over again by dream ; where she is corrected , embellished , refashioned .</p>
   <p>Let them seek and seek again , let them extend the limits of their happiness for ever , these alchemists who work with flowers ! Let them offer a prize of sixty or a hundred thousand florins to whosoever can solve their ambitious problems ! As for me , I have found my black tulip and my blue dahlia !</p>
   <p>Incomparable flower , tulip found at last , symboli-cal dahlia , it is there , is it not , in this so calm and dreamy land that you live and blossom ? Will you not there be framed in your proper analogy , and will you not be mirrored , to speak like the mystics , in your own correspondence ?</p>
   <p>Dreams !— always dreams ! and the more ambitious and delicate the soul , the farther from possibility is the dream . Every man carries within him his dose of natural opium , incessantly secreted and renewed , and , from birth to death , how many hours can we count that have been filled with positive joy , with successful and decided action ? Shall we ever live in and become a part of the picture my spirit has painted , the picture that resembles you ?</p>
   <p>These treasures , furnishings , luxury , order , perfumes and miraculous flowers , are you . You again are the great rivers and calm canals . The enormous ships drifting beneath their loads of riches , and musical with the sailors ’ monotonous song , are my thoughts that sleep and stir upon your breast . You take them gently to the sea that is Infinity , reflecting the profundities of the sky in the limpid waters of your lovely soul ;— and when , outworn by the surge and gorged with the products of the Orient , the ships come back to the ports of home , they are still my thoughts , grown rich , that have returned to you from Infinity .</p>
   <p>WHAT IS TRUTH ?</p>
   <p>I once knew a certain Benedicta whose presence ailed the air with the ideal and whose eyes spread abroad the desire of grandeur , of beauty , of glory , and of all that makes man believe in immortality .</p>
   <p>But this miraculous maiden was too beautiful for long life , so she died soon after I knew her first , and it was I myself who entombed her , upon a day when spring swung her censer even in the burial-ground . It was I myself who entombed her , fast closed in a coffin of perfumed wood , as uncorruptible as the coffers of India .</p>
   <p>And , as my eyes rested upon the spot where my treasure lay hidden , I became suddenly aware of a little being who singularly resembled the dead ; and who , stamping the newly-turned earth with a curious and hysterical violence , burst into laughter , and said : “ It is I , the true Benedicta ! It is I , the notorious drab ! As the punishment of your folly and blindness you shall love me as I truly am . ”</p>
   <p>But I , furious , replied : “ No ! ” The better to emphasise my refusal I struck the ground so violently with my foot that my leg was thrust up to the knee in the recent grave , and I , like a wolf in a trap , was caught perhaps for ever in the Grave of the Ideal .</p>
   <p>ALREADY !</p>
   <p>A hundred times already the sun had leaped , radiant or saddened , from the immense cup of the sea whose rim could scarcely be seen ; a hundred times it had again sunk , glittering or morose , into its mighty bath of twilight . For many days we had contemplated the other side of the firmament , and deciphered the celestial alphabet of the antipodes . And each of the passengers sighed and complained . One had said that the approach of land only exasperated their sufferings . “ When , then , ” they said , “ shall we cease to sleep a sleep broken by the surge , troubled by a wind that snores louder than we ? When shall we be able to eat at an unmoving table ? ”</p>
   <p>There were those who thought of their own firesides , who regretted their sullen , faithless wives , and their noisy progeny . All so doted upon the image of the absent land , that I believe they would have eaten grass with as much enthusiasm as the beasts .</p>
   <p>At length a coast was signalled , and on approaching we saw a magnificent and dazzling land . It seemed as though the music of life flowed therefrom in a vague murmur ; and the banks , rich with all kinds of growths , breathed , for leagues around , a delicious odour of flowers and fruits .</p>
   <p>Each one therefore was joyful ; his evil humour left him . Quarrels were forgotten , reciprocal wrongs forgiven , the thought of duels was blotted out of the memory , and rancour fled away like smoke .</p>
   <p>I alone was sad , inconceivably sad . Like a priest from whom one has torn his divinity , I could not , without heartbreaking bitterness , leave this so monstrously seductive ocean , this sea so infinitely various in its terrifying simplicity , which seemed to contain in itself and represent by its joys , and attractions , and angers , and smiles , the moods and agonies and ecstasies of all souls that have lived , that live , and that shall yet live .</p>
   <p>In saying good-bye to this incomparable beauty I felt as though I had been smitten to death ; and that is why when each of my companions said : “ At last ! ” I could only cry “ Already ! ”</p>
   <p>Here meanwhile was the land , the land with its noises , its passions , its commodities , its festivals : a land rich and magnificent , full of promises , that sent to us a mysterious perfume of rose and musk , and from whence the music of life flowed in an amorous murmuring .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE DOUBLE CHAMBER .</head>
     <l n="1">A chamber that is like a reverie ; a chamber truly spiritual , where the</l>
     <l n="2">stagnant atmosphere is lightly touched with rose and blue .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>There the soul bathes itself in indolence made odorous with regret and desire . There is some sense of the twilight , of things tinged with blue and rose : a dream of delight during an eclipse . The shape of the furniture is elongated , low , languishing ; one would think it endowed with the somnambulistic vitality of plants and minerals .</p>
   <p>The tapestries speak an inarticulate language , like the flowers , the skies , the dropping suns .</p>
   <p>There are no artistic abominations upon the walls . Compared with the pure dream , with an impression unanalysed , definite art , positive art , is a blasphemy . Here all has the sufficing lucidity and the delicious obscurity of music .</p>
   <p>An infinitesimal odour of the most exquisite choice , mingled with a floating humidity , swims in this atmosphere where the drowsing spirit is lulled by the sensations one feels in a hothouse .</p>
   <p>The abundant muslin flows before the windows and the couch , and spreads out in snowy cascades . Upon the couch lies the Idol , ruler of my dreams . But why is she here ?— who has brought her ?— what magical power has installed her upon this throne of delight and reverie ? What matter — she is there ; and I recognise her .</p>
   <p>These indeed are the eyes whose flame pierces the twilight ; the subtle and terrible mirrors that I recognise by their horrifying malice . They attract , they dominate , they devour the sight of whomsoever is imprudent enough to look at them . I have often studied them ; these Black Stars that compel curiosity and admiration .</p>
   <p>To what benevolent demon , then , do I owe being thus surrounded with mystery , with silence , with peace , and sweet odours ? O beatitude ! the thing we name life , even in its most fortunate amplitude , has nothing in common with this supreme life with which I am now acquainted , which I taste minute by minute , second by second .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Not so ! Minutes are no more ; seconds are no more . Time has vanished , and</l>
     <l n="2">Eternity reigns — an Eternity of delight .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>A heavy and terrible knocking reverberates upon the door , and , as in a hellish dream , it seems to me as though I had received a blow from a mattock .</p>
   <p>Then a Spectre enters : it is an usher who comes to torture me in the name of the Law ; an infamous concubine who comes to cry misery and to add the trivialities of her life to the sorrow of mine ; or it may be the errand-boy of an editor who comes to implore the remainder of a manuscript .</p>
   <p>The chamber of paradise , the Idol , the ruler of dreams , the Sylphide , as the great Rene said ; all this magic has vanished at the brutal knocking of the Spectre .</p>
   <p>Horror ; I remember , I remember ! Yes , this kennel , this habitation of eternal weariness , is indeed my own . Here is my senseless furniture , dusty and tattered ; the dirty fireplace without a flame or an ember ; the sad windows where the raindrops have traced runnels in the dust ; the manuscripts , erased or unfinished ; the almanac with the sinister days marked off with a pencil !</p>
   <p>And this perfume of another world , whereof I intoxicated myself with a so perfected sensitiveness ; alas , its place is taken by an odour of stale tobacco smoke , mingled with I know not what nauseating mustiness . Now one breathes here the rankness of desolation .</p>
   <p>In this narrow world , narrow and yet full of disgust , a single familiar object smiles at me : the phial of laudanum : old and terrible love ; like all loves , alas ! fruitful in caresses and treacheries .</p>
   <p>Yes , Time has reappeared ; Time reigns a monarch now ; and with the hideous Ancient has returned all his demoniacal following of Memories , Regrets , Tremors , Fears , Dolours , Nightmares , and twittering nerves .</p>
   <p>I assure you that the seconds are strongly and solemnly accentuated now ; and each , as it drips from the pendulum , says : “ I am Life : intolerable , implacable Life ! ”</p>
   <p>There is not a second in mortal life whose mission it is to bear good news : the good news that brings the inexplicable tear to the eye .</p>
   <p>Yes , Time reigns ; Time has regained his brutal mastery . And he goads me , as though I were a steer , with his double goad : “ Woa , thou fool ! Sweat , then , thou slave ! Live on , thou damned ! ”</p>
   <p>AT ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING .</p>
   <p>Alone at last ! Nothing is to be heard but the rattle of a few tardy and tired-out cabs . There will be silence now , if not repose , for several hours at least . At last the tyranny of the human face has disappeared — I shall not suffer except alone . At last it is permitted me to refresh myself in a bath of shadows . But first a double turn of the key in the lock . It seems to me that this turn of the key will deepen my solitude and strengthen the barriers which actually separate me from the world .</p>
   <p>A horrible life and a horrible city ! Let us run over the events of the day . I have seen several literary men ; one of them wished to know if he could get to Russia by land ( he seemed to have an idea that Russia was an island ) ; I have disputed generously enough with the editor of a review , who to each objection replied : “ We take the part of respectable people , ” which implies that every other paper but his own is edited by a knave ; I have saluted some twenty people , fifteen of them unknown to me ; and shaken hands with a like number , without having taken the precaution of first buying gloves ; I have been driven to kill time , during a shower , with a mountebank , who wanted me to design for her a costume as Venusta ; I have made my bow to a theatre manager , who said : “ You will do well , perhaps , to interview Z ; he is the heaviest , foolishest , and most celebrated of all my authors ; with him perhaps you will be able to come to something . See him , and then we 'll see , ” I have boasted ( why ? ) of several villainous deeds I never committed , and indignantly denied certain shameful things I accomplished with joy , certain misdeeds of fanfaronade , crimes of human respect ; I have refused an easy favour to a friend and given a written recommendation to a perfect fool . Heavens ! it 's well ended .</p>
   <p>Discontented with myself and with everything and everybody else , I should be glad enough to redeem myself and regain my self-respect in the silence and solitude .</p>
   <p>Souls of those whom I have loved , whom I have sung , fortify me ; sustain me ; drive away the lies and the corrupting vapours of this world ; and Thou , Lord my God , accord me so much grace as shall produce some beautiful verse to prove to myself that I am not the last of men , that I am not inferior to those I despise .</p>
   <p>THE CONFITEOR OF THE ARTIST .</p>
   <p>How penetrating is the end of an autumn day ! Ah , yes , penetrating enough to be painful even ; for there are certain delicious sensations whose vagueness does not prevent them from being intense ; and none more keen than the perception of the Infinite . He has a great delight who drowns his gaze in the immensity of sky and sea . Solitude , silence , the incomparable chastity of the azure — a little sail trembling upon the horizon , by its very littleness and isolation imitating my irremediable existence — the melodious monotone of the surge — all these things thinking through me and I through them ( for in the grandeur of the reverie the Ego is swiftly lost ) ; they think , I say , but musically and picturesquely , without quibbles , without syllogisms , without deductions .</p>
   <p>These thoughts , as they arise in me or spring forth from external objects , soon become always too intense . The energy working within pleasure creates an uneasiness , a positive suffering . My nerves are too tense to give other than clamouring and dolorous vibrations .</p>
   <p>And now the profundity of the sky dismays me ! its limpidity exasperates me . The insensibility of the sea , the immutability of the spectacle , revolt me . Ah , must one eternally suffer , for ever be a fugitive from Beauty ?</p>
   <p>Nature , pitiless enchantress , ever-victorious rival , leave me ! Tempt my desires and my pride no more . The contemplation of Beauty is a duel where the artist screams with terror before being vanquished .</p>
   <p>THE THYRSUS .</p>
   <p>TO FRANZ LISZT .</p>
   <p>What is a thyrsus ? According to the moral and poetical sense , it is a sacerdotal emblem in the hand of the priests or priestesses celebrating the divinity of whom they are the interpreters and servants . But physically it is no more than a baton , a pure staff , a hop-pole , a vine-prop ; dry , straight , and hard . Around this baton , in capricious meanderings , stems and flowers twine and wanton ; these , sinuous and fugitive ; those , hanging like bells or inverted cups . And an astonishing complexity disengages itself from this complexity of tender or brilliant lines and colours . Would not one suppose that the curved line and the spiral pay their court to the straight line , and twine about it in a mute adoration ? Would not one say that all these delicate corollae , all these calices , explosions of odours and colours , execute a mystical dance around the hieratic staff ? And what imprudent mortal will dare to decide whether the flowers and the vine branches have been made for the baton , or whether the baton is not but a pretext to set forth the beauty of the vine branches and the flowers ?</p>
   <p>The thyrsus is the symbol of your astonishing duality , O powerful and venerated master , dear bacchanal of a mysterious and impassioned Beauty . Never a nymph excited by the mysterious Dionysius shook her thyrsus over the heads of her companions with as much energy as your genius trembles in the hearts of your brothers . The baton is your will : erect , firm , unshakeable ; the flowers are the wanderings of your fancy around it : the feminine element encircling the masculine with her illusive dance . Straight line and arabesque — intention and expression — the rigidity of the will and the suppleness of the word — a variety of means united for a single purpose — the all-powerful and indivisible amalgam that is genius — what analyst will have the detestable courage to divide or to separate you ?</p>
   <p>Dear Liszt , across the fogs , beyond the flowers , in towns where the pianos chant your glory , where the printing-house translates your wisdom ; in whatever place you be , in the splendour of the Eternal City or among the fogs of the dreamy towns that Cambrinus consoles ; improvising rituals of delight or ineffable pain , or giving to paper your abstruse meditations ; singer of eternal pleasure and pain , philosopher , poet , and artist , I offer you the salutation of immortality !</p>
   <p>THE MARKSMAN .</p>
   <p>As the carriage traversed the wood he bade the driver draw up in the neighbourhood of a shooting gallery , saying that he would like to have a few shots to kill time . Is not the slaying of the monster Time the most ordinary and legitimate occupation of man ?— So he gallantly offered his hand to his dear , adorable , and execrable wife ; the mysterious woman to whom he owed so many pleasures , so many pains , and perhaps also a great part of his genius .</p>
   <p>Several bullets went wide of the proposed mark , one of them flew far into the heavens , and as the charming creature laughed deliriously , mocking the clumsiness of her husband , he turned to her brusquely and said : “ Observe that doll yonder , to the right , with its nose in the air , and with so haughty an appearance . Very well , dear angel , I will imagine to myself that it is you ! ”</p>
   <p>He closed both eyes and pulled the trigger . The doll was neatly decapitated .</p>
   <p>Then , bending towards his dear , adorable , and execrable wife , his inevitable and pitiless muse , he kissed her respectfully upon the hand , and added , “ Ah , dear angel , how I thank you for my skill ! ”</p>
   <p>THE SHOOTING-RANGE AND THE CEMETERY .</p>
   <p>“ Cemetery View Inn ” — “ A queer sign , ” said our traveller to himself ; “ but it raises a thirst ! Certainly the keeper of this inn appreciates Horace and the poet pupils of Epicurus . Perhaps he even apprehends the profound philosophy of those old Egyptians who had no feast without its skeleton , or some emblem of life 's brevity . ”</p>
   <p>He entered : drank a glass of beer in presence of the tombs ; and slowly smoked a cigar . Then , his phantasy driving him , he went down into the cemetery , where the grass was so tall and inviting ; so brilliant in the sunshine .</p>
   <p>The light and heat , indeed , were so furiously intense that one had said the drunken sun wallowed upon a carpet of flowers that had fattened upon the corruption beneath .</p>
   <p>The air was heavy with vivid rumours of life — the life of things infinitely small — and broken at intervals by the crackling of shots from a neighbouring shooting-range , that exploded with a sound as of champagne corks to the burden of a hollow symphony .</p>
   <p>And then , beneath a sun which scorched the brain , and in that atmosphere charged with the ardent perfume of death , he heard a voice whispering out of the tomb where he sat . And this voice said : “ Accursed be your rifles and targets , you turbulent living ones , who care so little for the dead in their divine repose ! Accursed be your ambitions and calculations , importunate mortals who study the arts of slaughter near the sanctuary of Death himself ! Did you but know how easy the prize to win , how facile the end to reach , and how all save Death is naught , not so greatly would you fatigue yourselves , O ye laborious alive ; nor would you so often vex the slumber of them that long ago reached the End — the only true end of life detestable ! ”</p>

    <head>THE DESIRE TO PAINT .</head>
     <l n="1">Unhappy perhaps is the man , but happy the artist , who is torn with this</l>
     <l n="2">desire .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I burn to paint a certain woman who has appeared to me so rarely , and so swiftly fled away , like some beautiful , regrettable thing the traveller must leave behind him in the night . It is already long since I saw her .</p>
   <p>She is beautiful , and more than beautiful : she is overpowering . The colour black preponderates in her ; all that she inspires is nocturnal and profound . Her eyes are two caverns where mystery vaguely stirs and gleams ; her glance illuminates like a ray of light ; it is an explosion in the darkness .</p>
   <p>I would compare her to a black sun if one could conceive of a dark star overthrowing light and happiness . But it is the moon that she makes one dream of most readily ; the moon , who has without doubt touched her with her own influence ; not the white moon of the idylls , who resembles a cold bride , but the sinister and intoxicating moon suspended in the depths of a stormy night , among the driven clouds ; not the discreet peaceful moon who visits the dreams of pure men , but the moon torn from the sky , conquered and revolted , that the witches of Thessaly hardly constrain to dance upon the terrified grass .</p>
   <p>Her small brow is the habitation of a tenacious will and the love of prey . And below this inquiet face , whose mobile nostrils breathe in the unknown and the impossible , glitters , with an unspeakable grace , the smile of a large mouth ; white , red , and delicious ; a mouth that makes one dream of the miracle of some superb flower unclosing in a volcanic land .</p>
   <p>There are women who inspire one with the desire to woo them and win them ; but she makes one wish to die slowly beneath her steady gaze .</p>
   <p>THE GLASS-VENDOR .</p>
   <p>These are some natures purely contemplative and antipathetic to action , who nevertheless , under a mysterious and inexplicable impulse , sometimes act with a rapidity of which they would have believed themselves incapable . Such a one is he who , fearing to find some new vexation awaiting him at his lodgings , prowls about in a cowardly fashion before the door without daring to enter ; such a one is he who keeps a letter fifteen days without opening it , or only makes up his mind at the end of six months to undertake a journey that has been a necessity for a year past . Such beings sometimes feel themselves precipitately thrust towards action , like an arrow from a bow .</p>
   <p>The novelist and the physician , who profess to know all things , yet cannot explain whence comes this sudden and delirious energy to indolent and voluptuous souls ; nor how , incapable of accomplishing the simplest and most necessary things , they are at some certain moment of time possessed by a superabundant hardihood which enables them to execute the most absurd and even the most dangerous acts .</p>
   <p>One of my friends , the most harmless dreamer that ever lived , at one time set fire to a forest , in order to ascertain , as he said , whether the flames take hold with the easiness that is commonly affirmed . His experiment failed ten times running , on the eleventh it succeeded only too well .</p>
   <p>Another lit a cigar by the side of a powder barrel , in order to see , to know , to tempt Destiny , for a jest , to have the pleasure of suspense , for no reason at all , out of caprice , out of idleness . This is a kind of energy that springs from weariness and reverie ; and those in whom it manifests so stubbornly are in general , as I have said , the most indolent and dreamy beings .</p>
   <p>Another so timid that he must cast down his eyes before the gaze of any man , and summon all his poor will before he dare enter a cafe or pass the pay-box of a theatre , where the ticket-seller seems , in his eyes , invested with all the majesty of Minos , AEcus , and Rhadamanthus , will at times throw himself upon the neck of some old man whom he sees in the street , and embrace him with enthusiasm in sight of an astonished crowd . Why ? Because — because this countenance is irresistibly attractive to him ? Perhaps ; but it is more legitimate to suppose that he himself does not know why .</p>
   <p>I have been more than once a victim to these crises and outbreaks which give us cause to believe that evil-meaning demons slip into us , to make us the ignorant accomplices of their most absurd desires . One morning I arose in a sullen mood , very sad , and tired of idleness , and thrust as it seemed to me to the doing of some great thing , some brilliant act — and then , alas , I opened the window .</p>
   <p>( I beg you to observe that in some people the spirit of mystification is not the result of labour or combination , but rather of a fortuitous inspiration which would partake , were it not for the strength of the feeling , of the mood called hysterical by the physician and satanic by those who think a little more profoundly than the physician ; the mood which thrusts us unresisting to a multitude of dangerous and inconvenient acts . )</p>
   <p>The first person I noticed in the street was a glass-vendor whose shrill and discordant cry mounted up to me through the heavy , dull atmosphere of Paris . It would have been else impossible to account for the sudden and despotic hatred of this poor man that came upon me .</p>
   <p>“ Hello , there ! ” I cried , and bade him ascend . Meanwhile I reflected , not without gaiety , that as my room was on the sixth landing , and the stairway very narrow , the man would have some difficulty in ascending , and in many a place would break off the corners of his fragile merchandise .</p>
   <p>At length he appeared . I examined all his glasses with curiosity , and then said to him : “ What , have you no coloured glasses ? Glasses of rose and crimson and blue , magical glasses , glasses of Paradise ? You are insolent . You dare to walk in mean streets when you have no glasses that would make one see beauty in life ? ” And I hurried him briskly to the staircase , which he staggered down , grumbling .</p>
   <p>I went on to the balcony and caught up a little flower-pot , and when the man appeared in the door-way beneath I let fall my engine of war perpendicularly upon the edge of his pack , so that it was upset by the shock and all his poor walking fortune broken to bits . It made a noise like a palace of crystal shattered by lightning . Mad with my folly , I cried furiously after him : “ The life beautiful ! the life beautiful ! ”</p>
   <p>Such nervous pleasantries are not without peril ; often enough one pays dearly for them . But what matters an eternity of damnation to him who has found in one second an eternity of enjoyment ?</p>
   <p>THE WIDOWS .</p>
   <p>Vauvenargues says that in public gardens there are alleys haunted principally by thwarted ambition , by unfortunate inventors , by aborted glories and broken hearts , and by all those tumultuous and contracted souls in whom the last sighs of the storm mutter yet again , and who thus betake themselves far from the insolent and joyous eyes of the well-to-do . These shadowy retreats are the rendezvous of life 's cripples .</p>
   <p>To such places above all others do the poet and philosopher direct their avid conjectures . They find there an unfailing pasturage , for if there is one place they disdain to visit it is , as I have already hinted , the place of the joy of the rich . A turmoil in the void has no attractions for them . On the contrary they feel themselves irresistibly drawn towards all that is feeble , ruined , sorrowing , and bereft .</p>
   <p>An experienced eye is never deceived . In these rigid and dejected lineaments ; in these eyes , wan and hollow , or bright with the last fading gleams of the combat against fate ; in these numerous profound wrinkles and in the slow and troubled gait , the eye of experience deciphers unnumbered legends of mistaken devotion , of unrewarded effort , of hunger and cold humbly and silently supported .</p>
   <p>Have you not at times seen widows sitting on the deserted benches ? Poor widows , I mean . Whether in mourning or not they are easily recognised . Moreover , there is always something wanting in the mourning of the poor ; a lack of harmony which but renders it the more heart-breaking . It is forced to be niggardly in its show of grief . They are the rich who exhibit a full complement of sorrow .</p>
   <p>Who is the saddest and most saddening of widows : she who leads by the hand a child who cannot share her reveries , or she who is quite alone ? I do not know .... It happened that I once followed for several long hours an aged and afflicted woman of this kind : rigid and erect , wrapped in a little worn shawl , she carried in all her being the pride of stoicism .</p>
   <p>She was evidently condemned by her absolute loneliness to the habits of an ancient celibacy ; and the masculine characters of her habits added to their austerity a piquant mysteriousness . In what miserable cafe she dines I know not , nor in what manner . I followed her to a reading-room , and for a long time watched her reading the papers , her active eyes , that once burned with tears , seeking for news of a powerful and personal interest .</p>
   <p>At length , in the afternoon , under a charming autumnal sky , one of those skies that let fall hosts of memories and regrets , she seated herself remotely in a garden , to listen , far from the crowd , to one of the regimental bands whose music gratifies the people of Paris . This was without doubt the small debauch of the innocent old woman ( or the purified old woman ) , the well-earned consolation for another of the burdensome days without a friend , without conversation , without joy , without a confidant , that God had allowed to fall upon her perhaps for many years past — three hundred and sixty-five times a year !</p>
   <p>Yet one more :</p>
   <p>I can never prevent myself from throwing a glance , if not sympathetic at least full of curiosity , over the crowd of outcasts who press around the enclosure of a public concert . From the orchestra , across the night , float songs of fete , of triumph , or of pleasure . The dresses of the women sweep and shimmer ; glances pass ; the well-to-do , tired with doing nothing , saunter about and make indolent pretence of listening to the music . Here are only the rich , the happy ; here is nothing that does not inspire or exhale the pleasure of being alive , except the aspect of the mob that presses against the outer barrier yonder , catching gratis , at the will of the wind , a tatter of music , and watching the glittering furnace within .</p>
   <p>There is a reflection of the joy of the rich deep in the eyes of the poor that is always interesting . But to-day , beyond this people dressed in blouses and calico , I saw one whose nobility was in striking contrast with all the surrounding triviality . She was a tall , majestic woman , and so imperious in all her air that I cannot remember having seen the like in the collections of the aristocratic beauties of the past . A perfume of exalted virtue emanated from all her being . Her face , sad and worn , was in perfect keeping with the deep mourning in which she was dressed . She also , like the plebeians she mingled with and did not see , looked upon the luminous world with a profound eye , and listened with a toss of her head .</p>
   <p>It was a strange vision . “ Most certainly , ” I said to myself , “ this poverty , if poverty it be , ought not to admit of any sordid economy ; so noble a face answers for that . Why then does she remain in surroundings with which she is so strikingly in contrast ? ”</p>
   <p>But in curiously passing near her I was able to divine the reason . The tall widow held by the hand a child dressed like herself in black . Modest as was the price of entry , this price perhaps sufficed to pay for some of the needs of the little being , or even more , for a superfluity , a toy .</p>
   <p>She will return on foot , dreaming and meditating — and alone , always alone , for the child is turbulent and selfish , without gentleness or patience , and cannot become , any more than another animal , a dog or a cat , the confidant of solitary griefs .</p>
   <p>THE TEMPTATIONS ; OR , EROS , PLUTUS , AND GLORY .</p>
   <p>Last night two superb Satans and a She-devil not less extraordinary ascended the mysterious stairway by which Hell gains access to the frailty of sleeping man , and communes with him in secret . These three postured gloriously before me , as though they had been upon a stage — and a sulphurous splendour emanated from these beings who so disengaged themselves from the opaque heart of the night . They bore with them so proud a presence , and so full of mastery , that at first I took them for three of the true Gods .</p>
   <p>The first Satan , by his face , was a creature of doubtful sex . The softness of an ancient Bacchus shone in the lines of his body . His beautiful langourous eyes , of a tenebrous and indefinite colour , were like violets still laden with the heavy tears of the storm ; his slightly-parted lips were like heated censers , from whence exhaled the sweet savour of many perfumes ; and each time he breathed , exotic insects drew , as they fluttered , strength from the ardours of his breath .</p>
   <p>Twined about his tunic of purple stuff , in the manner of a cincture , was an iridescent Serpent with lifted head and eyes like embers turned sleepily towards him . Phials full of sinister fluids , alternating with shining knives and instruments of surgery , hung from this living girdle . He held in his right hand a flagon containing a luminous red fluid , and inscribed with a legend in these singular words :</p>
   <p>“ DRINK OF THIS MY BLOOD : A PERFECT RESTORATIVE ” ;</p>
   <p>and in his left hand held a violin that without doubt served to sing his pleasures and pains , and to spread abroad the contagion of his folly upon the nights of the Sabbath .</p>
   <p>From rings upon his delicate ankles trailed a broken chain of gold , and when the burden of this caused him to bend his eyes towards the earth , he would contemplate with vanity the nails of his feet , as brilliant and polished as well-wrought jewels .</p>
   <p>He looked at me with eyes inconsolably heartbroken and giving forth an insidious intoxication , and cried in a chanting voice : “ If thou wilt , if thou wilt , I will make thee an overlord of souls ; thou shalt be master of living matter more perfectly than the sculptor is master of his clay ; thou shalt taste the pleasure , reborn without end , of obliterating thyself in the self of another , and of luring other souls to lose themselves in thine . ”</p>
   <p>But I replied to him : “ I thank thee . I only gain from this venture , then , beings of no more worth than my poor self ? Though remembrance brings me shame indeed , I would forget nothing ; and even before I recognised thee , thou ancient monster , thy mysterious cutlery , thy equivocal phials , and the chain that imprisons thy feet , were symbols showing clearly enough the inconvenience of thy friendship . Keep thy gifts . ”</p>
   <p>The second Satan had neither the air at once tragical and smiling , the lovely insinuating ways , nor the delicate and scented beauty of the first . A gigantic man , with a coarse , eyeless face , his heavy paunch overhung his hips and was gilded and pictured , like a tattooing , with a crowd of little moving figures which represented the unnumbered forms of universal misery . There were little sinew-shrunken men who hung themselves willingly from nails ; there were meagre gnomes , deformed and under-sized , whose beseeching eyes begged an alms even more eloquently than their trembling hands ; there were old mothers who nursed clinging abortions at their pendent breasts . And many others , even more surprising .</p>
   <p>This heavy Satan beat with his fist upon his immense belly , from whence came a loud and resounding metallic clangour , which died away in a sighing made by many human voices . And he smiled unrestrainedly , showing his broken teeth — the imbecile smile of a man who has dined too freely . Then the creature said to me :</p>
   <p>“ I can give thee that which gets all , which is worth all , which takes the place of all . ” And he tapped his monstrous paunch , whence came a sonorous echo as the commentary to his obscene speech . I turned away with disgust and replied : “ I need no man 's misery to bring me happiness ; nor will I have the sad wealth of all the misfortunes pictured upon thy skin as upon a tapestry . ”</p>
   <p>As for the She-devil , I should lie if I denied that at first I found in her a certain strange charm , which to define I can but compare to the charm of certain beautiful women past their first youth , who yet seem to age no more , whose beauty keeps something of the penetrating magic of ruins . She had an air at once imperious and sordid , and her eyes , though heavy , held a certain power of fascination . I was struck most by her voice , wherein I found the remembrance of the most delicious contralti , as well as a little of the hoarseness of a throat continually laved with brandy .</p>
   <p>“ Wouldst thou know my power ? ” said the charming and paradoxical voice of the false goddess . “ Then listen . ” And she put to her mouth a gigantic trumpet , enribboned , like a mirliton , with the titles of all the newspapers in the world ; and through this trumpet she cried my name so that it rolled through space with the sound of a hundred thousand thunders , and came re-echoing back to me from the farthest planet .</p>
   <p>“ Devil ! ” cried I , half tempted , “ that at least is worth something . ” But it vaguely struck me , upon examining the seductive virago more attentively , that I had seen her clinking glasses with certain drolls of my acquaintance , and her blare of brass carried to my ears I know not what memory of a fanfare prostituted .</p>
   <p>So I replied , with all disdain : “ Get thee hence ! I know better than wed the light o ’ love of them that I will not name . ”</p>
   <p>Truly , I had the right to be proud of a so courageous renunciation . But unfortunately I awoke , and all my courage left me . “ In truth , ” I said , “ I must have been very deeply asleep indeed to have had such scruples . Ah , if they would but return while I am awake , I would not be so delicate . ”</p>
   <p>So I invoked the three in a loud voice , offering to dishonour myself as often as necessary to obtain their favours ; but I had without doubt too deeply offended them , for they have never returned .</p>
   <p>THE END</p>
